Yes, this is a single malt distillery, but it is the variety of whiskies that are made here that make Yamazaki whisky special.  It is the variety of shapes and sizes of the stills, the variety in the sizes and kind of barrels used and it is the different ages chosen to make this whisky.  In this case, all are at least 18 years old, but some are much older.  Roughly 80% of the whisky is aged in Sherry cask with American and Mizunara casks used for the remaining 20%."," Honshu, Japan

That said, the juice was designed to reflect the Rat Pack-Era whiskey that Sinatra fell in love with and I can see why. The secret is the use of ""Sinatra Barrels”: charred American oak barrels with concentric grooves scored from top to bottom that expose the distillate to a greater surface area of both charred and virgin wood. Aged, blended with selected barrels of JD No. 7, and bottled at 90-proof (just like in Sinatra's day), the higher octane and extra oak make this a much bigger and more interesting version of the highest-selling whiskey in America. I wish they made it that way all of the time...for a third of the price."," Tennessee, USA

Corio Distillery popped up as a possibility of origin, but as this distillery closed in 1989 this information cannot be verified. Another name that popped up was Cawsey Menck in Sydney, however there is doubt to whether this distillery is still operating. Attempts to contact the distillery on the telephone were met with failure, and neither a website nor email address can be found. The bottle itself refers to being “Distilled in Tasmania”, yet no connection can be found there either. What we can ASSUME is that the whisky was matured in an American Oak cask, although this comes from the taste of the whisky itself.

The second family secret involves mellowing the whiskey while it's still in the barrels. Most Tennessee whiskey distillers rely on charcoal filtering to soften and mellow their whiskeys. Again following the example set by his great grandfather, Prichard accomplishes this crucial step by maturing his whiskeys in new oak casks with deep, 3-millimeter ""alligator"" char. The whiskey is distilled primarily from sweet white corn with lesser amounts of rye and malted barley in pot stills. It is aged for 10 years in both new, charred American oak barrels and 15-gallon rum casks before being reduced to 80 proof with limestone-filtered spring water and bottled intact, and unfiltered.

The American single malt is still aged for a minimum of four years in new, charred American oak barrels. But then the aged whiskey is placed into 620-gallon foeders (very large wooden casks) for further maturation. Some of the whiskey is drawn off and more gets added to replace it. Check your labels to make sure you've got the new or old formulation. This Diamond Peak will have the solera process on the bottle.  "," Colorado, USA

The certified Kosher whiskey was made with the guidance of the Chicago Rabbinical Council. In 2012, new American oak Kosher barrels were sold to a non-Jewish executive and then filled, in this case with a wheat recipe bourbon mash bill. In 2020, the bottling lines were flushed to ensure non-Kosher spirit would not be in contact with the matured bourbon. This allocated release will be sold before Passover 2021 begins with a new release to follow after the Jewish holiday."," Kentucky, USA

To create this release, single pot still whiskeys ranging in age from 13-26 years old which matured primarily in American oak ex-bourbon barrels were selected. Irish oak was harvested from the Knockrath Forest located in Co. Wicklow. Then the oak traveled to Spain and was made into staves which air-dried for 15 months. From these oak staves, hogshead casks were made and toasted. This whiskey then finished aging in these virgin Irish oak hogsheads for two years. The whiskey is bottled at cask strength with its ABV ranging from 56.1-56.6%. Available as of January 2020 in Ireland, UK, France, US and China."," Ireland

Unlike many of their whiskeys which used sourced whiskey, this is distilled entirely at their two distilleries in Park City and Warship.The recipe for High Country is 100% malted barley, but there are three recipes used. One is predominantly two-row malted barley with crystal 60 malt and chocolate malt added; another is 100% two-row malted barley; and one is 100% Scottish peated malt. Three different types of barrels are used for maturation: new charred oak, used bourbon & rye, and ex-port. Each of the three malted barley distillates are placed in each of the casks creating nine profiles. For the first release High Country release, only 6 of the 9 profiles were used and the whiskeys were 2-9 years old. Availability exclusive to Utah."," Utah, USA

This excess, while impressive, was a poor choice at the time. In contrast to today's booming whisky market, the unforgiving ebb of the mid- to late-twentieth century almost added Tomatin to the list of closed distilleries that folded during that time (Glenfiddich actually was the first to export Scotch whisky as a ""Single Malt"" during that time, in hopes of bucking the trend). Indeed, the distillery was forced to cut production in 1986, entering a spiral of divestment that lasted for almost two decades. In 2000, a Japanese trading firm, Marubeni, bought the distillery and revitalized the brand in conjunction with another Japanese firm. The Twenty-Five Year label, introduced in 2005, came as the revival was getting into swing, garnering international attention and renown for the distillery.

Born in Wisconsin, Selfridge was a retail magnate who took a shine to the shady end of Oxford Street in London, starting his eponymous chain of stores in 1906. Although the Great Depression ---partially aided by his gambling addiction and poor budgeting skills--- claimed Selfridge's fortune (and many single malt distilleries in Scotland, incidentally), the chain continued on to establish a reputation for curated selections and for the beautiful architecture of its locations. Honoring the chain's legacy and luxury, The Entertainer harkens back to the blends of the 1920s, when blended Scotch contained a greater, sybaritic proportion of malt whisky than grain whisky. Accordingly, this bottling contains 75% malt from the Highlands, Islay, and Speyside married with 25% grain whisky from the Scottish Lowlands.

Few distilleries are willing to cease production during the distilling season to perform this switch. BenRiach Dunder 18 Year comes from one of the distillery's heavily peated runs. Primary maturation takes place in American oak, and the spirit is finished in dark rum barrels. Only 1,888 bottles were filled.

While the barrel is often thought of as the primary contributor to a whiskey's overall flavor, the influence of the new-make (called ""cleric"" across the pond) can have a profound impact as well. The cleric is a product of the type of grains used, of the shape of the still, of the length of fermentation and distillation, of the size of the cut, of the type of condenser, and of many other factors that the master distiller can use to achieve his or her desired style. The distiller's safe, a small clear box where the distillate emerges from the final still, is the physical place where all of the distiller's work coalesces: the point where the final cut is made before entrusting the remainder of the process to the cask.

Using a recipe found in one of their great great great great great grandfather's Revolutionary War shoes, they experimented with various 1700's era methods of distillation found in his diary. They aged the resulting distillate in barrels made of wood taken from covered wagons found in present day Colorado, and left the product to rest for several months in a warehouse that President Theodore Roosevelt once stored his favorite guns in. It is sold in a simple rusty tin can, the way Revolutionary War soldiers would have enjoyed it. Only 41 cans were ever made, so if you find it, buy it! Editor's Note: April Fool's Day 2017, thanks everyone for playing along, your tasting notes were truly amazing!"," USA
