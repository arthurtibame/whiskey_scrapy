5.0,"Tried this at a Botuique-y Whisky Company tasting. This is an interesting piece of history as it was distilled in Ardbeg at a time Ardbeg was run by Laphroaig's manager importing peat from Port Ellen. This is beautiful with notes of vanilla, floral, delicate sweet smoke, spices, fruity, citrus, and umami."
