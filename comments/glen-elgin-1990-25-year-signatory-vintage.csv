4.0,"Nose: Sherry, sultanas, floral and nutty. Robust and rounded with some honey sweetness and a fairly strong oak note. There’s also a slightly off-putting aroma that is somewhat like nail polish remover. I’ve noticed the same thing before in some bourbon, but not usually in whisky.

Palate: A fruity, cereal and vegetal arrival. In the development some sweet malt, ginger and vanilla flavours emerge, along with a light oakiness that builds through the tasting. Some warm spicy notes and a bright anise or fennel seed flavour.

Finish: Long, malty but more cereal than sweet. The oaky character lingers.
    
A very nice whisky but I couldn't get past the feeling that it was only slightly better than the standard 12 year old Glen Elgin official bottling, which is considerably cheaper (like less than half the cost).

If it cost just a little more than the 12 year it would be worth it, or of the quality was considerably higher then it would be worth the premium price.  However as it is it doesn’t represent good value or bring enough to the table to make the investment worthwhile, and in my opinion it’s a fraction over-oaked anyway.

    “Very good” : 4 stars (but not value for money)"
