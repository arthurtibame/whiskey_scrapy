5.0,"Tried this at a Boutique-y Whisky Company tasting. All I was told was this has some Macallan and some sherry cask aged components. Great stuff with notes of chocolate, oak, raisins, toffee, tropical fruits, similar to rum at first. Wish finish was longer but was told by a fellow drammer it is usual for blends to have short finishes."
