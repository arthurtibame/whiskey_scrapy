4.0,"Hmm.. I'm not too sure if it's because prior tippling makes me more generous or I'm on the more highly rated drams but I've had a good run tonight. I've been all over the globe tonight, NZ/USA, USA/NZ, back to USA over to Islay and now to..Sweden. Ok going in blind. Light smoke, sweet vanilla (newish ex- bourbon casks), light body (younger spirit).. did I guess it right..Hmm ok 6 years old, peated..tick, limited run of 25 casks.. random side fact, casking..1/3rd correct American, Spanish and French.. interesting! To be fair to the distillery I did select a highly rated bottling so it may not be representative   of all their work but still nice effort. Aftertaste is light, spirit is balanced but after the Widow Jane bourbon not as fulfilling. Still decent job."
