2.75,"Hirsch Horizon Straight Bourbon Whiskey represents a journey of exploration and discovery in American Bourbon Whiskey. The Horizon Straight Bourbon Whiskey is a blend of two mashbills; the first is 94% of the bourbon matured at 5 years and 4 months in a mixture of 75% corn, 21% rye, and 4% malted barley. The second is 6% of the bourbon matured at 6 years and 2 months in a mixture of 60% corn, 36% rye, and 4% malted barley. Hirsch Horizon Straight Bourbon Whiskey is distilled in Lawrenceburg, IN and bottled in Bardstown, KY at 92 proof/46% ABV. I was given batch number AHH0320 to taste, however, there was nothing spectacular or that stood out from the bourbon leaving it rather average.

Color: Clear Gold

While looking through my Copita nosing glass, I noticed the legs were quite consistent. They were very thin and evenly spaced apart like they streamed down in orchestra. After taking the lid off my glass, the sweet bourbon aromas appeared with hints of caramel, honey, butter, wintermint, vanilla, charred oak, and cornbread. On the palate were hints of toffee, cinnamon, baking spices, pepper, and a presence of leather was detected. The finish was long with continuous notes of leather, charred oak, and pepperiness."
