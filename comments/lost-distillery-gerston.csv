4.25,"Smokey, rich, and sweet.  Big fan"
3.5,"I think this is a wonderful dram for introducing people to peaty whisky. 

Nose: oak spice with orange peel, a bit of vanilla, and mild campfire smoke.

Palate: oily texture that really fills up the mouth. Notes of oak spice, orange and also green fruits, and the smoke is not as noticeable as on the nose. 

Finish: dry but lingering vanilla and slight spice."
