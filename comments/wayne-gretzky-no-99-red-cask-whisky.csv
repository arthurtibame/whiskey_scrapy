4.0,Purchased for a friend and myself to sip on during a get together. We were both surprised how good it was for the monitary value. The bottle presents well and is a welcome addition to the collection

3.0,"Fruity and leather on the nose.  Very sweet and smooth, with some spice on the tongue.  Finish burns and lingers with a tingle on the tongue"
4.0,"Nice presentation, unique color the packaging will attract attention on the shelf.
 subtle aroma lends a hint of an interesting flavor to come.

This whiskey has a bit of an edge to it not something everyone will like but I find it enjoyable too many brands are afraid of this sort of statement.

The flavors are nicely blended and the wine cask flavor is right there front and center with the others joining in over time  then everything clears out very smoothly.

For me at least this is not so much a mixer as a sipping experience.

This is likely to be a regular in the cabinet."

2.0,"Not up to my expectations, high alcohol first taste a turn off. No competition for 40 Creek, or Crown Royal. Would not recommend"
3.0,"Genuinely surprised with this whisky. I find myself enjoying it far more than I expected.  Perhaps a little too sweet, but it has an excellent fruity aroma and a smooth finish. The rye adds some spice but it is balanced well with maybe some carmel notes and a little wood notes too. A great sipping or dessert whisky."

1.0,"This is not what I was expecting at all from the 99, the glass was in my hand for at least an hour and a half, it was so bad i could not get around it. Sad!"
3.5,"I'm not sure about the Distiller's review as I do not get any of the notes Blair has expressed. I get a full bouquet of dark fruit and dried fruit. The wine casks that it was finished in come through on the finish with some spiciness and grape jelly. At $35/bottle here in Ontario I figured this would be, at best, a good mixer. What a fantastic surprise to uncover a new Canadian sipper (I'll mix it with something eventually but it's really not necessary). Red wine and whisky, nothing but good stuff!"

3.0,"I'm not gonna wax poetics here or use cheesy hockey analogies, but I will say it's good... and winy, obviously. The nose evokes wine, vanilla and almost maple syrup. The palate is all oak (and almost overbearing) with tannin hitting your tongue. The finish is fleeting yet pleasant. I'd definitely drink it again (hell, dozens of times), but even at $40 CAD, I still wouldn't buy it."

4.0,"I get lots of caramel and toffee notes on the nose. It has a short life on the palate with a rather distinct red wine finish.
A definite sipping whiskey (I feel it's more of a dessert drink) and for the price it's one I'll be contemplating picking up next time."

4.0,I’d rate this 3 1/2 stars but the app won’t let me. I’ll give it the extra half star for being a great value for money. Lots of dark brown sugar and a floral note with a hint of leather on the nose. It’s got a fairly rich mouthfeel for a whisky that’s only bottled at 40% ABV. The finish is medium-short and there is a distinct red grape note there. I’m impressed.

4.0,"This is more along the lines of what I expected from Angel's Envy. It has a  fairly similar palate as Straight Edge Bourbon but not quite the same edge. Easy drinker, inoffensive. Apples, cherries, and some hints of dark fruit on the end."
5.0,"Smooth, nice finish"
3.0,"I’m tasting this at the bar at YVR. I’m a huge fan of Canadian whiskey, but I don’t love this. The nose is indeed rather gluey, with a pleasant fruity warmth. Lots of spice is nice, but the red wine aftertaste (think dregs from last night’s glass, not sherried scotch) is... weird. Some sips I’d almost go for a 4, but then I think 3 max. The expert rating is surprising."

2.5,"Not sold on this one. The nose is a mix of leather/smoke with touches of citrus. The body is oily but harsh. There’s not a lot of flavor while resting on the tongue and has a mild/moderate burn when swallowed. The after taste is somewhat pleasant as it reminds me of a mixture of red wine in the beginning and a bit of caramel within a minute or two. It’s an adventure of aroma and flavor, but I think I’ll pass on the next trip."

1.0,"Very sharp oak. No complexity. One note flavour. Tastes very young. Not enjoyable at all. Huge amount of young alcohol burn. Needs to be put back in the cask, possibly aged in a more heavily used barrel. Based on the other reviews, they must be bottling in small batches and the inconsistency is astounding. Would not be as critical if it was half the price. Much better value available on the market."
4.0,"Tasted Feb 10, 2018. Dad’s bottle, picked up at Sobey’s Emerald Park. Easy pour. Nose dominated by rubber inflatables, vanilla and light spices. Carries to taste with some caramel and dark rum on the tongue. Easy finish. Would pick up a bottle."

Use it for mixed cocktails only and still hesitant when mixing a drink. Did not enjoy any of the bottling from Wayne Gretzky, including the wines and ice wines. Unfortunately they do not live up to the great ones hockey performance! Sad, very sad."

3.0,Nothing about this drink is bad... but there's nothing compelling about it either. The wine notes are not heavy enough to warrant the red cask tag on it's label. The tasting notes of leather and brown sugar are clear. I'm glad I tried it but I wish I would have tried it at a bar first before purchasing a bottle. I would never turn it away but i don't anticipate purchasing a second bottle. The rating of 90 is probably a few points too high. Good not great.

3.0,"This dram is a bit of a riddle for me. On the the nose there is smoke, and behind it is caramel. However on the palate, up front is a sweet taste of vanilla, and a lingering taste of caramel maybe. However, I cannot find the smoke that I melt. Maybe this if a different kind of smoke than the peat I am used too"

2.0,"An unassuming rye. It’s definitely not a top goal scorer, the boozy nose leads me to believe that this whiskey could hardly tie up it’s own skates. 

On second nosing, I get burnt cotton candy, and vanilla. In the mouth, The sweetness quickly fades and is replaced with and a mild chilli heat that hits moderately and slowly fades. What it lacks in complexity, it makes up for in wearing the number 99.

Overpriced."
