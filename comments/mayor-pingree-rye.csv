3.75,"Ok I admit to being a homer when it comes to my state and our distillers, brewers, and wineries. Valentine puts out some truly good stuff without the home field advantage though with some fantastic vodkas and whiskey. This is my first dram of their rye so I am cautious, but optimistic. Nose is sasparilla and a bit astringent almost like a manly aftershave. First sip is more of the rootbeer and rye mash up with a soft burn the dies fairly quickly. This is an interesting dram as it seems to lack that heavy pepper traditionally found in ryes abd leans to a smoother path. Overall not as nice as the other Valentine offerings, but still nice if you are looking for a smoother rye than much if what is on the market."
