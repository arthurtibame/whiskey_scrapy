4.0,"FOR THE PRICE it's a good value. Not a fancy dram by any means, but a hearty peat fix for $20 USD at Trader Joe's. Extra smoky."
4.0,"Nice smoke at an affordable price. Good to have on hand for regular drinking, saving pricier bottles for more special events."
3.0,Slight peat aroma with sweetness.  Taste is okay with a slightly underdesirable initial and long lasting sweetness.  Spice remains on the palate with little peat presented.

2.75,"Mellow but noticeable smoke. Like other reviews said, it tastes a little watered down in that the aftertaste is almost nonexistent. Still, it’s enjoyable enough to bring to all the BYOB house concerts I go to as I have no problem sharing this at around $21 a bottle! Especially because those folks are mostly drinking cheap beer. I’ll be a hero!"
null,More “wet cigarette” then peat

2.0,"easy to drink, but comes across as watered down"
2.0,"Nose: strong peat. Not smooth smoke. More like peat smoke over freshly laid asphalt. Tobacco pouch. Leather. Old man local pub. 

Taste: alcohol bite. Honey. Finish is short leaving burn with a hint of peat. It gives you a glimpse of what a peated scotch is meant to taste like before quickly disappearing; leaving you wondering what you just sipped. 

It’s a value islay. Decent for an after work everyday drink. Think of it as the box wine of scotch. Good enough for everyday drinking but maybe not something to break out for company. 

Still - it excels as being dependably average and for that it’s worth buying."

3.75,Peaty smoke and salty on the nose. Then sweet with vanilla tones progressing to smokey peppery finish. Short finish.
