4.0,"(As with all my notes, this was blind, had no idea what I was drinking) This clear, golden, and sediment free pour was oily and interesting to the eye but unfortunatley a little lacking on the nose.  I may have to do this again sometime to confirm.  Once I was shown what I was drinking I had a hard time with my assessment of the nose but hell blind is blind...
I did get some faint apple and pear but not much else.  However I could forgive that if I wasn't in a nosing mood because the flavor was surprising solid after the lackluster nose.  

It was bright yet delicate with a sweet fermented pear and a kiss barrel.  I want to go learn more about how this is aged now because I could have sworn there was a little peat on the finish.  

Problem is I enjoyed this a lot but could literally pound it down.  This isn't complex, its delicious and I want to drink it like a lite beer...

This is a great Whiksy.  It wont make for much of a conversation piece outside of the bottle story but I'll have this in my bar as long as they keep making it.

5.0,Green spot is a very dangerous purchase. At this price point you are suddenly thrust into the beginning of a single pot still journey. Light toffee and green apple nose with a very similar taste. The taste lingers just a little longer than you would expect but vanishes quickly. This amazingly drinkable whisky will show you how Irish Whisky was meant to taste.

5.0,"Just a fantastic Irish whiskey, I even prefer it to the Yellow Spot and Redbreast 12. On the noes there is some light fruit, mainly apple and coconut are two I seem to always get and some pear with vanilla mixed in between it all. Upon drinking though, it is just a super friendly, fruity with some slight biscuit note that I tend to taste in Irish whiskey. While I know many may not agree this is better than yellow (I'm not even entirely convinced, I tried it at a bar so who knows what state the bottle was in or if that's what they actually gave me at all, will have to buy a bottle in the future to confirm...) I hope everyone interested in Irish whiskey give this a try, especially if they maybe didn't particularly enjoy RB12. This may be closer to your taste, it is for me!"

4.25,"Green Spot is one of the top dogs in the world of Irish whiskey. I’m about halfway through my bottle, and I have to say that I believe it warrants its status.

Nose : Vanilla, citrus, slight shortbread cookie I so often find in Irish whiskey. Very vibrant nose.
P: Coconut, orange, cantaloupe, vanilla cream, dark fruit. It's full and rich. My favorite part of the whiskey.
F: It’s a bit short. The dark fruit and vanilla cream linger.

Overall, this a damn fine Irish whiskey. It has a great nose and a sublime palate. The only area where it’s lacking is the finish. It’s very brief, which is likely a product of its low 40 ABV.

$60 is a bit high for an NAS Irish, but I feel that I got my money's worth on this one. Irish whiskey has a reputation for being a very narrow category with little variable across the board. The Green Spot does a good deal to distinguish itself from the rest of the pack. It boasts a unique palate that you don't often find in this category, or any. This one is a great option for a whiskey drink at any level. Solid stuff."

Delicate mouth feel fresh fruit on the front banana and apple open up to berries with a pleasing sweetness to the finish. On further tastings have had a slightly citrus and light spice open on the pallet. IMO for around $70 USD one the best whiskeys available.
4.25,After a few days in Dublin Irish whiskey typically has given me a buttery note and subtle flavours this is the first one that has big flavour fruit sherry notes but still buttery and oaky and ridiculously smooth note in tasting everyone liked red breast better in blind tasting everyone picked greenspot very interesting guess men like the word breast :) lol

OVERALL: Nose is very unique! The unmalted barley brings a totally different profile compared to Scotch. Light yes, but so so flavorful. Interesting to not find two main whiskey flavors at all: vanilla and caramel."

4.0,"We we're having a debate earlier today on Distiller on Irish Whiskey and whether there were any quality options at a reasonable price point. As the debate raged, @PBMichiganWolverine and @Scott_E both recommend this one as a solid option that is on the same level as Redbreast 12. So having a haircut already scheduled and my fave Whiskey/Cigar bar right next to my barber I planned to taste this one. 
I was not not the least bit dissapionted. On the pallette it's very rich and sweet. Butterscotch, toffee, caramel and dried fruits. Lovely entry that leads to a touch of oak and some welcome spice notes and a nice malty and honey granola driven finish. All this for around $40 a bottle, sign me up. I think I have found an Irish Whiskey I will be keeping on hand! Cheers All!"

4.0,A grown up Jameson.  Light and fruity but with a strong clean backbone.  Excellent.  A daily drinker.
4.25,"Green Spot can trace its roots to the early 1900s, when Jameson sold whiskey to wine merchants Mitchell & Son, it was common then for wine merchants and publicans to bottle their own whiskey but sell it under the distiller's brand name. It was called Pat's Whiskey in the early part of the 20th century and became part of a range that included Blue Spot, Yellow Spot and Red Spot, all of which had different ages and recipes. The current Green Spot is made at Midleton from pot still whiskey aged between seven and nine years, with 25% coming from sherry casks and a medium weight pot still content. Made in very limited quantities. Very good value at €60. Have tasted the Red, Green and Yellow Spot - have to say that the Yellow is the best.

Nose - Gently spicy and oaky on the nose. Some fruit aromas of pineapple, red apples, mango and papaya then some ginger, vanilla and honey.
Taste - 	Juicy and fresh with some syrupy fruit flavours of tropical fruit salad, pineapple, then some honey and ginger on the finish.

Very soft on the palate to start with a building sweetness leading to a quick spice followed by some citric green apple sourness.  A buttery viscosity builds with layers of vanilla, malt cereal and sugar, again giving an impression of shortbread cookies.
-
A savoury spiciness lingers into the finish with hints of cinnamon and fresh apple.

Green Spot is a great whiskey. A nose of green apple, pear, vanilla, porridge and light new wood shavings. A creamy taste of cereal, shortbread and citrus rind with a medium finish of honey and ginger. A great, solid, spirit-lifting, pot still whiskey. One of the best. I’d give it 19 stars. Maybe more."
4.5,"Vanilla cream with hints of oak, apples, and cereals mixed in. There is a tease of raspberry underneath. The longer it sat, the more the berries showed up, bringing along green banana, and the vanilla cream transitioned to just the neutral tartness of a plain yogurt with the berries, cereal, and banana being the main attractions. On the palate, I could only think of this as a rustic, simple breakfast consisting of several courses. It started with sugar frosted berries, primarily raspberries and blueberries, with mint leaves mingled in. The underripe banana then gets cut into slices on top of the cereals and light cream as toast with orange marmalade gets placed on the table. At the end, a bowl of sugared porridge gets placed down and dusted with oak and baking spices. The whole thing, despite the sweetness, tastes wholesome, clean, and fresh, leaving me thinking of enjoying that breakfast on a warm sunny day with nothing more to look forward to than taking a nap under a shady tree after eating my fill. I enjoyed this quite a bit more than the Redbreast Lustau or 12yr and is likely to become my Irish of choice."

4.0,"Nose: A rising; warm breeze of green apples, toffee, and a light oakiness are the first greetings this whiskey has for me. After a little more chit-chat (and a tiny, tiny dash of water) this pretty Irish lass shows me a bounty of tangerine, star anise, clove, and vanilla cream. 

Taste: What was once tart green apples evolves into honeycrisp apples and buttery vanilla shortbread. After some time and a little water, the initial spread is replaced with a wonderous buffet of blackberries, açaí, strawberries, lychee and honey all served on oaken platters. 


The body of this whiskey is thin but not watery, I would best describe it as silky."

3.0,"I'd like to start off and say I'm not a huge fan typically, nor particularly experienced, with Irish Whiskey.  I tried this as a recommendation and I have mixed feelings.

Nose: Vanilla, brown sugar, and wood.  Very pronounced ethanol smell which was hard to get past.
  
Flavor: Vanilla, butterscotch, toasted coconut, and tasted a lot like shortbread cookies.  Reminds me of chessmen cookies.  I really like the flavor but I'm having a hard time getting past the alcohol bite. 

Finish: Green apple, nuts, more shortbread, slight citrus peel.  A little short though.

Overall I really enjoyed the flavors but I think maybe this needs a couple more years of aging to take off some of the alcohol bite in the nose and flavor and to extend the finish.  I'd worry that this would remove the flavors I did like of shortbread cookies and toasted coconut.  Maybe I need to try Yellow Spot?"

I was hoping for a rich, creamy, interesting drink I could have while I cycled between Scotch, bourbons and rye.  I guess 2 out of 3 isn't all bad.  My original review from several years back still stands true today, with a few minor variations; It smells very light and floral on the nose, like honeysuckle on the vine, then meanders to vanilla.  The mouthfeel is still very creamy, and the palate is still sadly one-note (sweet honey) and boring.  No real finish to speak of.  It's smooth, unobtrusive, inoffensive, and just pretty ok.  I tried to like it more than I do, but this will be my last bottle.  Maybe it's time to bring cognac and Armagnac back into my rotation..."

4.25,"My sister is a periodic whiskey drinker who prefers a smooth dram with minimal alcohol burn.  I went to her house this past weekend for dinner and an evening by the fire pit, so I brought along a bottle of Green Spot, which I knew she had not tried.  The Green Spot became the first of a trio we sampled, along with two of her selections - Aberlour 16 and Jameson 18.

I'm long overdue reviewing the Green Spot.  Among the three, it was my clear favorite. 

On the nose, it's pear, apple, vanilla and cream.   The palate is very fruity - more pear and green apple, along with some citrus.  There's also more vanilla and caramel.  The finish is mild, with just a touch of grapefruit. 

Beautiful is the first word that comes to mind.  It's a rich and full whisky, sweet and fruity without being excessively so, and very well balanced.  

I had one significant takeaway from tasting these three whiskeys in succession - ABV matters, but it's not everything.  While the ethanol is somewhat muted at 40% ABV, the Green Spot bursts with flavor.  More than the Jameson, and far more than the Aberlour, despite both clocking in at 43%.

Overall, I'd say the Green Spot is a great whiskey for both novices and enthusiasts. My sister and I both give it the seal of approval."
3.75,"Nose: A delicate orchard with toasty cereal and vanilla with a hint of spice. Once you get past the spice and barley, a caramel sweetness surfaces. You can nose it all day long!
Palate: Much spicier than the nose suggests, but not aggressive at all. The honeyed cereal is still there, with green apples rounding off the taste. 
Finish: Medium finish, more of the oak and barley notes remain, rather than the fruity ones.
Comparison to Yellow Spot: I prefer Yellow Spot for the more fruity nose, the addition of cream and toffeee on the palate and wine note on the finish; but Green Spot is not a lesser drink, just different.
Overall: Quite a spectacular whiskey! It is an epitome of balance and complexity: it never gets boring, and always feels just right. There are better Irish whiskeys out there, but not at this price. I would highly recommend everyone to try this!"

Palate: Smooth smooth smooth.  Definitely 80 proof.  Barley, apples with caramelized brown sugar.  Baking spices and coffee beans.  Creamy, almost lactic thing on the finish - almost like coffee and cream.  Green apples and bananas again.  Almonds.  Still delicate.

Other notes:  Not a ton of ""heft"" here - this is very pretty and understated.  If Red Breast was that rich kid you hung out with in high school, their younger sibling would be Jameson and this would be their older sibling that traveled Europe, become super classy, but was still cool to hang out with.  Though not my style, this is a fantastic example of the style - as per usual, this rating is me trying to be as objective as possible, and leaving my own personal biases aside.  An excellent sip."

4.75,"Finally going to try this and some of the Redbreast line. Where I live this and the standard Redbreasts range from $60-$90. (I paid no more than that for a Chieftains independent bottling of Glentauchers 15 yo Sherry cask Scotch of which only 673 bottles were available.) One of my west coast sources were offering them at about $20-25 less per bottle, then had a free holiday shipping offer. I was hooked!! This is a lovely Irish pot still. Noses of honey, vanilla, fruit, toasted cereal, almond. It is cream in the mouth and the nosed flavors ring true. My first sip was so lovely I didn't even notice the alcohol's slight heat. I became more aware on the second sip--not because it is ""hot,"" but I was able to get my mind past the initial glory of the dram's balanced flavor. That being said, I think this is often over-priced. I was able to get this for $45, but, where I live it goes for $70 and is NEVER on sale."

null,I'm not rating at first pour as I would like to spend some time with the whisky as the bottle opens up. What I will state right now is that its so light it makes it hard for me to get anything out of this whisky. I think there should be an international law that prohibits whisky producers from selling whiskies under 92 proof and especially under 86 proof. Green Spot @ 80 proof is simply too weak to enjoy the flavor profiles offered in a whisky!

Because this is triple distilled hence why you get this very clean and light feeling throughout your course.

I’m most of the way through the bottle and the review has gone down ever so slightly. The first dram I had from this bottle was Devine: creamy, shortbread, a little wood spice then sherry and orange peel aftertaste. Short but sweet. I’d have gone with 4.25-4.50 then. This tasting note has held up over the weeks but I’m not finding anything else and I dare say my biggest fear with these kinds of whiskies is that I’ll get bored with them compared to scotch. But for now I’m enjoying the ride. I’ll revisit this review once I have some proper comps. At $50 and in a post tariff landscape you have to respect the value here as well.

4.25,"There are lots of things that I should be doing tonight instead of sipping whiskey and writing an entry in my whisk(e)y journal. But, it’s been a slog at work this week, there have been construction crews excavating some sort of pit outside my home into the wee hours of the morning (my God, the noise pollution!), and I’ve decided I deserve something proven to be delicious for a change of pace.

I’ve been a member of Distiller for many months now, but it has come to my attention this evening that while I loyally love Irish whiskey, I have yet to post any reviews of one of my beloved Irish drams. We all have stories and explanations for why we love distilled spirits the way that we do. So I guess since I’m procrastinating tonight, I will elaborate a bit on mine. (Feel free to skip to the part of this post where I actually review some whiskey.)

What would eventually become my love of Irish whiskey (and later Scotch) evolved out of a love for artisan root beer as a minor many, many years ago. I was a root beer snob growing up, always picking apart their characteristics and searching for something new to try. But, as I outgrew the all too frequent sweetness of root beer and acquired an obsession with spice, I morphed into a ginger beer snob. Later, when I was of legal drinking age and everyone else was chugging various (disgusting) forms of vodka cranberry, vodka juice, vodka yuck, etc., it was suggested to me that I try a Moscow Mule. Needless to say, I’m not a big fan of Moscow Mules (nor vodka).  But, in trying to find other mixed drinks that would work with my love of ginger beer, I came across Irish Mules. What began with naive experimentation with Jameson and ginger beer evolved into a hunt for better quality Irish mixers and eventually landed me in the esteemed (or elitist?) paradise of Single Pot Still Irish Whiskey. 

Which all these years later brings me to this delicious bottle of triple distilled, Green Spot Single Pot Still Irish Whiskey. I think everyone is familiar with the story of the Mitchell family and how they added daubs of colored paint on the casks to mark the various ages of whiskey inside, so I will spare you all a recitation of that. Let’s get on with some review details!

Age: NAS (but reportedly 7-10 years)
Cask Type: A blend of ex-bourbon (first-fill and refill casks) and some ex-sherry
ABV: 40%
Price: $49.99

Nose: Creamy, sweet, and fruity. Rich, decadent French pastries (croissants, brioche, etc.). Buttery toffee, cream cheese, peach-apricot jam, and orange marmalade. D’Anjou pears, apple pie, and neroli oil. Hints of strawberry, Ceylon cinnamon, lemon zest, and raw walnuts. Given the ABV and triple-distillation, it is on the lighter side, but there are plenty of layers to uncover if you’re willing to go diving. 

Palate: Light-bodied yet rich. The nose transfers but is slightly more muted by comparison. Oily butter, breakfast cereal, honey, and dainty vanilla essence. There’s some green banana on the palate which I do not get on the nose, but I will say that I get loads of this with the Yellow Spot.  Raisins, orchard fruit, and a mild, zesty spice (cinnamon and ginger). Faint sherry influence.

Finish: Medium length and sweet. Honey, buttered cereal, and fruit basket. Slightly drying with vanilla to close. 

Verdict: Deceptively simple, easy to drink, and delicious. While I’ve had all three of the Spots (Green, Yellow, and Red), I have yet to do a side-by-side tasting of them to see how they truly compare to one another. I’m fairly confident Red Spot is my favorite, as the green banana notes completely dominate the Yellow Spot for me. But I’m less certain of how Green and Yellow Spot compare. In any case, Green Spot is delightful (if a little light on ABV - trying this at >40% would be so appreciated). While it’s typically a little more expensive and harder to find, I’d like to always be able to keep this and Redbreast 12 on my shelf as daily drinkers. Highly recommended (alongside Redbreast 12, which I also need to review) for those looking to explore the world of Single Pot Still Irish Whiskey. 

This falls in between a 4.0 and 4.25 but I’m going with 4.25 so I can give this a 90.

3.25,"Nose: Malt, green apples, peach, lemon zest, sweet herbs, fresh-cut hay, vegetable oil, a hint of vanilla.

Palate: A fruity and malt-driven arrival that is a little oily in texture. The development brings an interesting combination of nutty (walnut and almond, mainly) and fruity (pineapple) flavours with some accompanying warm spice. Oiliness is noticeable throughout the palate but it's not a rich, creamy oiliness. More like sunflower oil.

Finish: Medium/short. A woody nuttiness that fades into a slightly bitter fruit aftertaste with a tinge of brine.

Considering the amount of love this whisky receives here and elsewhere, I'm at a bit of a loss. Particularly as some of the positive reviews come from people with whose opinions I generally agree. Overall it seemed to me a capable dram, but nothing particularly special, and at the local price of AUS$100 there is no way in hell I'd buy this over any similarly priced scotch single malt. Maybe it's just not a profile I find attractive?

My relationship with Irish whisky is very mixed and I've tasted only a few expressions priced below $100 that I'd call good quality or good value. On the other hand more expensive Irish expressions, particularly those from Midleton, can be divine. I'd happily pay 50% more than this for a bottle of Yellow Spot any day, and Barry Crockett Legacy, Midleton Very Rare, Powers John's Lane and the better Redbreasts are all well worth the (sometimes considerable) expense.

However, I just didn't get this one. My tasting was from a commercially purchased 30ml sample and it is possible that it was old and oxidised so to be fair I will re-review this some time in the future, but I need to be willing to spend the money on a whole fresh bottle and I'm afraid the enthusiasm to do that is minimal.

""Above Average"" : 3.25 stars"

4.0,"Very light. Similar mashbill notes to scotch whisky. Unripe banana. Not my preferred style, but executed very well."
4.5,"First had this at a bar in Dingle, Ireland, on the rocks. Recommended by the bartender as a local favorite. Didn't care much for whisky back then but was one of the more memorable ones I had in my visit to the country.

Finally found a bottle being offered locally, because this one isn't as common as other Irish offerings from, say, Redbreast and Jameson.

The Green Spot pours out a light honey color, similar to Alfalfa Honey. Aroma is wonderful, laced with tropical fruits - oily coconuts and sweet pineapple, some dried fruit (e.g., apricot, though much less pronounced) too.

Taste was done neat, in a Glencairn. It's hard to say where this whiskey starts and where it ends. There is very little separation of flavor here. From the moment you take a sip and drink it down, you get a little bit of that oily fruitiness, some oak, a spice that grows, climaxes and slowly fades, a lingering brininess, and a bitter/sour nip at the very end. This goes down SMOOTH - making it a very enjoyable medium-bodied drink on it's own."

3.5,"The nose is toasted malt, and some fruit, banana and apple skin.  Rubbing alcohol.

On the palate, lots of caramel, strong cereal grain, burnt malt.  Perhaps a little marshmallow?  Definitely some mint.  A slight hint of green apple.

The dry cereal notes dominate the finish.  It tastes like having a mouthful of grain.

There is a lot going on here, but I feel like there is no balance- everything is just all over the place.  It's better than any other Irish whiskey that I've had.  I like it, but it's just ok.  I have to confess, Irish whiskey has repeatedly failed to impress me.  Every bottle I  have bought, in every price range, really struggles to justify its place in my collection.

For the price, I can probably think of a dozen bourbons, a dozen ryes, and 2 dozen single malt scotches that I'd enjoy more(some of which are even cheaper).  It does add something different to my collection, which is ok, I guess."

3.75,"Nose - honey, apple, banana, grass, moderate ethanol burn. 

Taste - toffee, sweet cream, sea salt, caramel, milk chocolate, cereal, juicy red fruits, mild alcohol notes and I definitely get the underripe bananas from the expert notes, finishing fairly quickly with fading toffee and banana flavors."

4.0,"Only very few times i have read about irish whiskies that cause a lot of hype in people. This one is the case. It seems to be that everybody loves this whiskey. So, i gave it a try. This is what i got:

Bottled at 40%abv, burnished gold color.

On the nose, it just feels like a speyside whisky. Red apples, pepper, honey, cookie dough and vanilla. 

On the palate, tobacco, cinnamon, red pepper, red fruits and grain whiskey. It is very creamy and ""grainy"". 

Aftertaste is medium long, with ginger, chilli and wasabi notes.

Actually a nice dram, but it doesn't live to the hype. 83/100."
4.5,"Green apple! On the nose and the palate, with a little grassy earthiness going on.  Not a long finish but a very good whiskey."

3.5,"Nose is vanilla and fruit.  Palate is apples, honey, and a bit of vanilla.  Almost reminiscent of a highland scotch - but that could be a wish.  The finish is a zing of citrus, then oak to mellow it out.  As much as I like this whiskey, it leaves me wanting to open a bottle of scotch even more.

4.5,"Nose - Butter biscuit, fruit, berries, and spice.
Palate - Green apples, honey, tangerines, and vanilla.
Finish - Cocoa, graham crackers.

Green Spot is an Irish single pot still whiskey aged in both bourbon barrels and sherry casks and the result is a wonderful combination of shortbread malt, fruit, oak spice, and vanilla.

On the nose, this smells like a traditional Irish pot still whiskey with the normal shortbread cookie aroma, but then you pick up on more subtle notes of dried berries and fruit from the sherry casks.

The taste is warm and well-balanced  considering there are a handful of different flavors to sift through. Every sip presents another layer of complexity. It tastes like it is much higher proof than it actually is.

Putting Green Spot side by side with Redbreast 12 is an apples to oranges comparison. Both are excellent Irishy whiskies and each brings their own unique smell and taste."

3.0,"Interesting. I was not expecting that... Almost feels like they have placed some artificial flavoring to achieve the flavors I’m tasting. 

Nose
Green Apple, it’s tarty and fruity smelling up front, pears. Vanilla creeps in right after. Short oak on a deep whiff.

Taste
Apple juice, white fruit... it’s like a subtle highland single malt. white pepper, minty finish. I don’t get the butteryness most Irish whiskys give. 

Reminds me of the green apple caramel lollipops I used to eat as a kid, tangy and sweet. This dram is dangerous because it tastes like juice. Not in a bad way. 

Mouthfeel
A very very short dram. Watery coming in, there’s a bit of spice and heat that wants to develop but falls shy of anything actually being there. Very feint heat present like a lit match blown out. 

Overall I like it, but will probably not spend the money to buy the bottle again. This is a dram to me when you see it at the bar and there is nothing else you’d want, a fall back drink to order. I like it enough to drink it, but want to spend my money on something a little more nuanced . This is like the fruity Minute Maid juice you’d find in your fridge that your kids drink. Almost too sweet."

4.75,By far one of my favorite whiskeys in my collection. Elegant and smooth with notes of butterscotch and honeysuckle for myself. Smooth finish and complex with orange peel
3.25,There’s a honeyed easy drinking dimension to this but not sure I really like the green apple notes. Ultimately disappointing.
