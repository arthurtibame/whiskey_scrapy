2.0,"Whisky critics like to talk this one up because they know it's also the source for a lot of great American ryes like Whistlepig and Jefferson's and Lock, Stock, and Barrel. But the truth is that Alberta Premium is a fairly typical not-quite-bottom-shelf Canadian whisky. And that the method by which most Canadian whisky is made means that it doesn't actually *matter* that this stuff is 100% rye, because a good percentage of the finished product is distilled to such a high proof that the constituent grain isn't recognizable, anyway. Flavours of vanilla, toffee, maple syrup (lots of maple syrup), distant grass, light fruit. A touch of oak. Some distant rye spice. Young and simple. Alberta Distillers is capable of making great whisky, but it doesn't really end up in ths bottom-shelf blend."

3.0,"This is a phenomenal starter whiskey. It's smooth and even the rawest whiskey drinker will enjoy it. It wont hold a lot of appeal for more sophisticated palates, but you won't break the bank, and if you have to, beginners won't get hassled for mixing into something. Though if you have to, I recommend a tiny amount of water. It'll soften whiskey for someone getting into it, and you'll be able to get more taste."

3.0,"A surprise, this rye was very drinkable for the money. Gentle, with a sweet, light nose with only a hint of fruit. The palate is coating, mild rye spice, and honey. The finish is short, a little dry, and hints of citrus or pith. For 100% rye this lacks flavour, spice, and finish. However, it was not offensive and could serve as a warm up whisky or a mixer nicely"

3.0,Candied nose. Like ol' fashion candy corn. Smooth mouth and finish with no linger or aftertaste beyond light rye. A bit of angel food cake on the nose too.

3.75,"Well damn, I like it. I'm a great fan of comparitive tasting, so just for fun I paired it with Canadian Club 100% rye. The CC is noticeably darker but otherwise very similar, which is to say deliciously spicy and herbal. The CC seems slightly fuller and rounder in body, but that could well be a cognitive illusion based on the darker color. I give the Alberta Premium the nod by a sliver thin margin for authenticity,  ie. no added coloring."

4.0,Not exactly “smooth” but it has a nice caramel flavour with unbeatable quality:price ratio.

Smells and tastes like cheap alcohol, I hate that. If you get over that, it tastes like a typical rye, not a very good one, and diluted."
