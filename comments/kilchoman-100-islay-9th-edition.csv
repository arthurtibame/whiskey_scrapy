Really earthy peat bog smoke, more like laphroaig then caol ila or lagavulin.  Some brine, and a good bit of sweetness from the ex bourbon casks.  Really good whisky, B+."

4.0,"Light gold with copper veins in the glass.
Peat well evident on the nose even if not very high, cheered by the sweet notes of ripe apricots, vanilla, a splash of lemon and a clear salinity. To let it breathe, the peat grows and becomes more fleshy, alcohol well integrated and not at all intrusive.
Smoke floods the palate, more ashy than from a barbecue, much more intense and full-bodied than the smell, dragging with it plums, lemon, a herbaceous touch, all resting on an ocean of salinity. The flavors actually struggle to emerge, peat and salinity are so pungent as to eat away almost everything, underpinned by the alcohol content. On the length, a pinch of ginger.
Long finish, used ashtray, salt and spices."
