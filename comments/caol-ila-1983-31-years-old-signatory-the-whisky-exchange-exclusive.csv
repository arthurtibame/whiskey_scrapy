4.5,"So.. today is my birthday, and i was born on 1983, so it felt right to ""expend"" one of my samples. Of course i picked the 31yo Caol Ila 1983, from Signatory the independent bottler. This is a ""The Whisky Exchange"" exclusive, (a very nice online whisky store). 

Bottled at 48.1%abv, burnished gold color. 

On the nose it was magnificent. So many good whiskies lately. Very Medicinal peat. Incredible perfumed.

Sea. It actually has a beach aroma.

Earthy-heather peat; Foam, very perfumed.
There is a citric fruit. beautiful. Ok it is Pineapple. Amazing. Grapefruit juice.

There are two layers of aromas here. One is peat/earthy and the other is fruity. They just co-exist. Orange after first sip. incredible aroma. 

On the palate things get complicated. The first sip is a punch in the face. Peat. Toffee. Black pepper. Orange. Too peppery but nice.

Aftertaste is way too powerful. Even for a peathead like me. Salty, Smoky, Sulphuric.

SUPER SMOKY. IS SO SMOKY THAT YOU ACTUALLY COUGH.Smoke is overpowering me. And i am a peat head. Not as pleasant as it should be.

You have to let it breath for at least 10 minutes or the smoky aftertaste will consume your throat. Way to powerful. 

Overall, i rate this baby 91 over 100, it is a nice dram but the excess of smoke (i cant believe i am actually writing this) is too much."
