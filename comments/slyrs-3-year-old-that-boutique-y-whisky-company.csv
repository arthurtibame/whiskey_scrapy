3.75,"It's really impressive how TBWC does it's bottlings. I've tried quite a lot of official distillery bottlings that are quite bad and then you try the offerings after TBWC gets hold of them and they are miles better. In thought they worked their magic as part of their own special finishing process but apparently not. They have a bit of a genius picker who goes around the distilleries selecting good casks. I really don't understand why a number of distilleries have so much great stuff and butcher it upon release...are they going for maximum volume and mixing the bad with the good? Is there something else they are doing? It really is a mystery to me...in 2 years time I must remember to ask TBWC staff at Dramfest.

Now the underlying spirit isn't anything great especially after the HP which despite great distllate they butchered, but TBWC pulls it up a notch to be quite respectable. Biscuity honey viscous dram as per the default TBWC style. In this cask it's the distllate rather than the casking which isn't quite up to par."
4.25,"For a cask strength whisky that is only 3 years old, this is quite amazing. Maybe it’s because the climate in Bavaria is less consistent than in Scotland, but there is definitely a lot of flavor from Bourbon casks I’m here. Caramel, light fruit, pretty sweet and not aggressive. 92"
