3.0,"It is not bad for the price point. Had to try it, specially after reading that is top ten popular blends in UK. Will buy it again when cash flow would not allow me any better ;)"

3.25,"Simple but worth the money as an easy-sipping dram. Initially the nose has a funk that I associate with grain in it, but with time it mellows to overcooked cereal notes which I find somehow pleasant (could be the charred barrel combined with grain). Beside that there is also some caramel and orange/grapefruit peel, with a touch of candy sweetness. Peppery and spicy on the palate, with some bitterness but reasonably contained. Short, warm finish and a little dry."
3.75,"Orange zest and bit of saltiness, finishes with a nice bit of honey and caramel"

3.0,"Had it among 9 other whiskey’s (including 6 Bourbons) in a blind tasting night and it was the worst. Star rating is a bit generous. Below 3-stars is what I consider undrinkable, and I haven’t had, but 1 or 2 whiskey’s hit that mark in my life. Will add that it’s hard distinguishing taste between 10 different whiskeys this may be a bit harsh, but it at least falls under drinkable in my book."

2.25,Light sweet blended whisky. Not the full experience I expected. But considering the price it’s not bad.

3.25,"The nose is your classic butterscotch and salt, just a touch of mild wood char. It's a sweet, rounded and very friendly nose, with not much burn at all. The legs are nice and oily.

The tips of the tongue is Werther's Original butterscotch with a salty follow-up. A chewy body amplifies the sweet savoriness. It's not sugary, but it's got that toffee second part.

The finish settled into some more ashy wood and barrel business. It's slightly bitter, with only a trace of the tannins that sometimes show up at the end. There is more dark burnt-cookie bottom than there is a pucker.

It's not an incredibly complex Scotch but it's very pleasant, if you can handle the bitter end. It is a good starter Scotch for the price and for it's adherence to style."
