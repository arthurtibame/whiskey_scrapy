2.0,"Didn’t know I was about to taste a run of the mill rye that has about 1/4 the complexity of crown rye when I laid down 40 cool ones PLUS TIP for 1oz of this stuff- I turned around looking for the bar owner to perhaps look into his eyes with the message  of ""dude?! did you refill this bottle with Rittenhouse or something? Lame.. but who knows- bad batch, year, bottle perhaps?  All in all I was disappointed. 
      
      I love buffalo trace, and the saz/buffalo nose is there... but this release is not worth your hard earned $$-  Look else wear."

2.0,"Not sure what I was expecting,  but I guess something great under the 'BTAC' banner. Didnt live up to the hype, rather dry and bitter finish. I've had better 4 year old Rye's."

Pretty darn good. 126proof and feels like it 
Rich flavors of spicieness with cinnamon-sweet hot apple finish."

3.0,"$25 one-ounce pour

Brown sugar, vanilla, and oak notes on the nose. Was a bit hot going down and tasted like I was eating a handful of fruity candy. Finish was decent and a little spicy. Overall I really liked the nose and the taste was unique. The finish was ok. Worth  getting 1 bottle at retail but definitely not the secondary prices. I'd get one for the collection but probably not a second bottle."
