4.5,Aged another two years. Came out fantastic.
5.0,"You know you have tasted one of the best whiskies ever as soon as you watch it on the bottle. This one was the case. This discontinued bottled can only be find online, paying a high price for it, and it deserves every penny.

Bottled at 40%abv, with a tawny color.

On the nose, its fantastic: cough syrup, brown sugar, toasted caramel, orange candy, lemon, some floral notes and cremè bruleè. 

On the palate, it is ALSO fantastic. Tobacco, Ashes, Oranges, a pleasant smooth flavor, old wood, almonds and a very long and mouth watering. Elegant, VERY VERY ELEGANT, hence the ""elegancia"" name.

Overall this is a 100 over a 100, absolutely beautiful, powerful, elegant, perfumed, magical. If you can find it, buy it. SLAINTE"
