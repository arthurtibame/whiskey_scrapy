4.0,"Last night before i had Glenmorangie Signet, now the ruler of all whiskies for me, i had a Grant's sherry cask. Not bad actually but yet another dram i wouldn't buy again.

Bottled at 40% abv, amontillado sherry color. 

On the nose: vanilla, sherry, nuts, blackberry marmalade, slight perfumed peat.

On the palate: chilli, oak, hay, cereal, sherry and the toasted crest of a vanilla cake. Mostly spicy finish medium long.

Actually a good dram, i rate this one 86 over 100, BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT GLENMORANGIE SIGNET, YOU SHOULD PASS ON THIS ONE."
