0.25,Super smooth Canadian blended whisky with caramel notes on the nose and the palate. Almost tastes like it was flavored with caramel. Total Wine employee was eager to pour me a taster

4.25,Very smooth and accessable sipping whiskey.  Somewhat sweet with a good mouth feel. No unpleasant notes.

3.5,"Incredibly smooth whisky with a simple, forward flavor profile.

On the nose its VERY maple syrup forward. Light carmel.

Sipping, I get a lot of maple and some carmel, almost a butterscotch or toffee note.

Only gripe is that I wish it was a bit stronger than 80 proof but, that being the only thing, this is a great canadian whisky in general, and even better for the price."

2.5,Alcohol on the nose but honestly not as much on the taste. Sweet and kinda mapley. I have had worse... But I've also had better.
