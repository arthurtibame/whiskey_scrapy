3.0,On the nose you have a joint selfie of melon and vanilla – with bread photobombing the view. But the palate is more focused: delicious French pastries and freshly cut fruit. Quite tannic and warming.

3.0,"A light and fruity nose along with honey and citrus. The sweetness carries over onto the palate delivering oak, cinnamon and fruit.    As it finishes, the palate is left with black pepper, cinnamon spice and oak.  A good dessert whisky.  Paired with pumpkin pear cobbler, buckwheat crumbs, cracker jack gelato, butterscotch bacon and sage. [85/100][Tasted: 9/18/14 @ Whisky on the Hudson; 1/31/16 @ Eat Mosaic]"

3.0,"Honey and pistachio pastry in the aroma. Fruit cup and apricots, pineapple in syrup flavour chased by a dash of spice. A nice quaff but not as impressive or interesting as the concept sounds."

A réessayer car dégusté après 6 autres drams 🙈"

5.0,"Mind blown!  This amazing bottle is filled with subtlety. A nose kicked off by red velvet cake blossoming into a ever so subtle nuttiness and closing with the endowed sauterne finish. There’s not real separation between the various noses and it absolutely flows so smoothly. The first sip is a pleasant warmth, like you have the first time you see your best friend from childhood. A bit of fruit and then caramels that roll into a oak and then the sauterne. This made me sit down and re nose and re taste to make sure I wasn’t imagining the experience. A beautiful bottle."

3.0,Deep tastes of dark fruit. Sweet but not overwhelmingly so. It has a gentle heat with a lingering peppery finish.

2.25,"Nose: pineapple, honey on buttered toast, ripe green grapes, sweet popcorn, milk chocolate, strawberry

Palate: hits with quiet strong alcohol, slightly sweet and fresh but the alcohol burn doesn’t leave much space and what remains on the finish is a light wooden bitterness and a fruity sour grape aroma

The nose is intriguing and very enjoyable but the palate doesn’t deliver on that fully. Still a refreshing straight forward and hard hitting dram."

3.0,Very sweet. Great memories of Devon 😍
4.0,"Fruity and floral, with Asian pear and perhaps pineapple on the backend. The mouthfeel is oily and fantastic, with allspice on the finish. 

You don't want to leave me unattended with this bottle."
3.0,"Floral, with strange notes of correctional fluid on the nose. Fairly thin mouthful, with some tropical fruit, nutmeg, and pepper on the palate. The finish is spicy and of medium length. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this whisky as much as I had hoped."

3.0,I loved the 20 year....this not so much. To be fair this is my ninth tasting but in a way that should deaden my taste buds to the harsher notes but it doesn't. Started off well but the bitter aftertaste overpowers the initial vanilla citrus notes. High 2's rounding up to 3 as it's cheap at $55 USD

3.5,"Soft, lots of grape, can feel the white wine finish. Much lighter than a dark red wine. Sweet earth tones. Quite good."
3.5,"This is nice, Almost like a desert wine initially. Molasses on the nose, sweet, medium body with just a bit of burn at the end."
4.0,"My second Tullibardine, this one is a whisky that has been matured using a sauterness finish, to give it an enhanced flavor profile. 

Bottled at 43%abv 

On the nose: Pepper right in the nose. Herbal, Aniseed, Azafran.
Super spicy on the nose, Reminds me of the turkish bazaar. Honey. Very interesting

On the palate: Honey and pepper. Pineapple and Almonds. A little straightforward but not bad.

Aftertaste is good. Smoky like a burning cigar, Dry grass. Powerful smoky flavor. Tobacco. 

Overall this is a nice dram, interesting and can be used to pair it with some exciting dishes but i wouldn't have this as my first option for an everyday dram. 81/100"
