3.5,"An interesting drop. It's a dram of two halves. Marzipan / christmas cake icing honey,  vanilla and hint of green apple on the nose. Palate expands on that with slight spicey burnt caramel oakiness. Initially I mistook it for metalic, plasticky ethanolly bitterness although that comes through more prominently on the aftertaste which lets it down a bit after the nose. Hard one to rate. 3.5. But for the aftertaste it would have been  higher. Slightly disappointed given the reputation of the distillery."
