3.0,"Brown sugar and honeysuckle on the nose.
Melting vanilla bean ice cream on the palate. 
A short-lived cardamom on the finish, with milk chocolate that clings on for awhile. I do really enjoy this whiskey, but I think it's deserving of neither the widespread hype nor the scathing criticism in which it's been so deeply mired. Glad I have it in the collection."

2.0,"On the nose coconut and vanilla after a strong whiff of isopropyl alcohol.  On the palate is a quick flash of sweet buttery vanilla, caramel, and banana before the alcohol overpowers and abruptly ends on a sour note with a tinge of lemon detergent. No oakey finish, just the continuation of alcohol burn.  
  
  I was drawn in by the 17 year bourbon on the description, unfortunately whatever it was ""accidentally"" mixed with it, completely ruined what could have been an enjoyable experience.  I've resolved to only using this stuff in my cooking. Not even worthy of mixing in a cocktail."

2.0,Marketing BS.  This is the last Orphan Barrel I purchase.  Why you ask?  Because it sucked and because they hyped up Forged Oak as a 15 year old bourbon that I must buy.  When it's gone it's gone.  Guess what a year and a half later I still see it popping up.  Orphan Barrel isn't rare or allocated.  It's Diageo bullshitting.  Do yourself a favor and track down some VOB BIB.  It's $15 tops and better than any of the marketing BS that Orphan Barrel has to offer.  I heard the next Orphan Barrel to follow up Gifted Horse is Unicorn Tears and guess what???  It's made with real unicorn tears.  Piss off Diageo.

3.0,"Diageo isn't exactly doing their premium Orphan Barrel series any favors with releases like this.  The story behind Gifted Horse -- and I stress the term story, because it's blatant marketing speak -- is that the distillery ""accidentally"" spilled some 17-year old Bernheim bourbon into a vatting of much younger, 4-year old bourbons, then realized that the resulting blend tasted amazing.  Yeah, right.  The company probably had some barrels of bourbon that got a little long in the tooth, and decided to even out the mix as much as they could with young, sweet juice before releasing it for a big price tag.  Apple cider defines the profile of this whiskey, although it's a spiced, mulled cider.  The problem with this expression is that the young whiskey gives it way too much heat at this high an ABV -- I see this as something that would have been better below 50%.  As it is, it's rough and burns on the way down.  Not easy to drink, and not much complexity to justify fighting through that heat.  For $100, I'll pass easily."

3.0,"Well, I paid just over $90 for this rare, ""rescued"" bourbon from Diageo so I feel like I should give it a proper review.

The story behind this is quite the fable- after rescuing some 17-year old bourbon from a recently acquired rack house, the fine folks at Orphan Barrel accidentally dumped in some 4-year old corn whiskey into it and ""ruined"" the older stock.  (39% 17yo and 61% 4yo).  But, upon tasting it they realized they had created something much better.  (This is the actual story printed on the bottle label).  Rolls eyes...

Anyway, a quick review as I've plowed through this bottle by using the majority of it as a mixer with Coke.  I know, I know- who does that?  Someone craving a B&C that couldn't get to the liquor store before it closed- that's who LOL.

This comes in at 115 proof and is a dark, caramel color in the Glencairn.  The nose is predominately corn with a bit of sweet caramel/toffee and the slightest hint of oak barrel.  On the tongue, it's lots of corn and caramel apples.  It's not complex at all and washes away with a blast of heat from the ABV.  The burn lingers on for awhile as the oak barrel residue hangs around longer than I expected.  That saves this from being a complete, one dimensional dud.

As a mixer, it was merely an expensive way to drink through an overhyped bottle of rare bourbon.  It did get the job done quite well, I might add, as I woke up this morning with what seemed like an entire bag of cotton balls stuffed into my mouth and my head pounding like my local, high school drum line was practicing just outside my bedroom window.

Overall, avoid this $30 bourbon with a marketing hyped $60 markup.  It's worth a $8-10 try at your local watering hole if you must try these Orphan Barrel offerings.  Otherwise, there's a ton of better bourbon available at 1/3 the cost of this one.  3.25 stars.  Cheers, my friends."

3.0,A rich bourbon that didn’t have an amazing nose. Side by side to green spot the green spot was way better and more enjoyable.
4.5,"Definite apple, spice, and wood notes with a touch of heat still, which is surprising at 17 years old.  Very good. A bit like a fine wine bourbon hybrid"
3.75,Strong on oak nose but not young oak. Almost creamy smooth with a hint of cherry and yes I did catch a note of apple peel towards the end of the taste. The corn whiskey adds a bit of a kick to add young to an old sage. Slightly hot on the back of the tongue then mellows out. Fun fun fun.

4.0,"Solid whiskey, smooth finish"
3.0,"Taking a short break from the distillery tour to review an American whiskey. This blended whiskey from Orphan Barrel (Diageo) is bottled at 57.5% ABV and is most likely natural color of a dark copper and at this ABV I would think it is also non chill filtered. This sample was sent to me by Lee. 

This blend consists of 17 year old Bernheim bourbon (38.5%), 4 year old high rye bourbon from MGP (51%) and 4 year old corn whisky also from MGP (10.5%). The story, or tall tale as it would seem, is that the Bernheim was ""accidentally"" added to the blend. 

The nose is potent, plenty of alcohol. Ripe red apples, cinnamon and oak. Lots of corn. Vanilla, toffee and a little butterscotch. Some orange and a little rye spice. Milk chocolate and toasted nuts. 

The palate is powerful and peppery. Apples and oak, lots of both. Lots of corn too. Toffee and caramel. Not much more to it than that. Very little complexity. The power of the high ABV drowns out anything else that might be there. 

I added some water to see if anything else could be coaxed out. More apples on the nose and what seemed to be a bit of a rubber hose note. On the palate it just brought out more corn. 

Full bodied mouthfeel. Hot and spicy. 
The finish is long, spicy and full of oak and corn. 

Not a very impressive blend. Seems a bit too high on the corn. Way too overpriced for what you get at $90. Seems like a result of Diageo's typical over inflation of prices. While I am a bit disappointed, I'm still glad to have tried it. Variety is the spice of life after all, and the more variety the better. 3.25. Thanks again Lee. 
Cheers"
