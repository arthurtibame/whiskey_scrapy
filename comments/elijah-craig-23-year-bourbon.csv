3.0,"Oak and hot on the nose. Pass that I do pick up vanilla. Taste - oak again and the hotness is still there at 45% ABV it's a little off putting. Still I tasted spice and vanilla. With water added, brings the hotness down but made the oak stronger and bitter. So I recommend no water. All and all its a good bourbon just not worth the huge price tag."

5.0,"This is a surprise for an oldie! So smooth and comlplex (full disclosure; i had this on thd tour at Heavan Hill as a bonus tasting while honeymooning). On the nose you get dark brown sugar and currant. The palate finds vanilla, currant, carmel, faint baking spices, and wonderful oak flavors! I usually find old bourbon (over 15 years) to have too much oak but this one hits all the key points. When i have an extra $300 i will be buying a bottle!"

2.0,"Disappointing. I'm a huge fan of the 21 & the barrel proof. The oak comes through so beautifully. This, there's not much more than chemical coming through on this one. Definitely try before you buy. 2nd tasting: Nail Polish remover on the nose. Spicy in the mouth. Vanilla & caramel I hear about are non-existent."

5.0,Starting to show the age with more wood than sweetness but still quite well balanced and delicious.

4.0,"Not everyone likes this bourbon because of the much stronger oak than the 18 year, but if you are fan of moderately higher oak/wood flavors this one is for you.  When you first sip the flavor is rather light and then there is an explosion of wood, orange, caramel and vanilla - very smooth."
4.0,"Sweet, a little too oaky due to the age. Hints of bubble gum."

5.0,"this is the oldest bourbon I've had. it's smooth, mellow and immediately I began sipping slower and slower. enjoying each sip more. it really opens up after 5 minutes in the glass. I added a couple drops of water. I'd buy this again.
Had a second glass the other day. Add a little water to bring out the sweetness. This is fantastic. Grab a glass if you can."

3.0,"Yeah, the nose is oaky. Not a surprise. Vanilla, caramel, and linen as well. Rich and sweet. Interestingly, I get a grape note as well. On the palate, very silky. Lots of wood, but not u pleasant. A bit of staleness or dampness, and pleasant sweetness. A hint of clove and citrus soda at the end, maybe lavender soap. Unique. 10/18/17"
3.0,"At 90 proof it is a balanced dram that reminds me of an aromatic tobacco. Cherry and cinnamon spice blended with classic caramel and vanilla. The heavy oak flavor was dominant though. The lower proof keeps this one a pleasant sipper, but nothing special in my book, especially at the price point."

4.25,"Nice juicy fruitiness entering mid palate, then huge oak but not as if licking a barrel, then lots of leather dryness mixed with some vanilla"
4.25,Oaky as other have mentioned bc its age. On the dry side with some bite on entry but finishes smooth. Nice to pull this one down on the VA lottery and bust out for special occasions but likely wouldn’t pay $200 for a bottle again. Too many other rare ones to try.
4.5,Oaky but awesome

3.0,"I respect this bourbon, I really do, but why it exists and why anyone would pay over $200 for this baffles me. It’s so oaky and dry that any complexity worth exploring is buried beneath the wood. A step back from the Elijah Craig Barrel Proof and the 18 year old as far as balance and overall enjoyment."

4.0,"Oak and vanilla. So smooth. Not sure that I even have the palate to fully appreciate this, but I’ll try. 4.75"
4.25,"(bottled 4/7/17 barrel 83) 
Deeper amber in color.  The Aroma was a mix of Almond and Spearmint. More oak continues to emerge as it opens.  Overall an earthy sweetness here. 

Nice dark fruit in the flavor and a good amount of oak, but not too much. It seemed to get more savory as I spent time with it. Later in the glass vanilla takes center stage. Honey at the end.  Really nice, but slightly short of epic"

4.5,"The nose is full of ripe fruit, sweet caramel, oak and vanilla. The palate is dry and fills the mouth with oak, caramel, vanilla, strong baking spices with just a hint of ripe fruit in the background. The finish is long with caramel, oak and vanilla that lingers, with baking spices that fade nicely. This has aged to perfection."
4.5,"Incredible stuff. Sweet and very oaky. If you like oaky bourbons, you’ll love this."
4.25,"👅 Black pepper, rye, spice, leather, tobacco, viscous dry wine texture. 

🏁smooth lingering. Mellow bite."

4.25,"In a nutshell, this is what the Rhetoric bourbons wish they tasted like. Tremendously oaky, yet somehow still balanced. The nose and the palate are pretty much identical with strong oak, toasted pecans, honey, vanilla, rich caramel, brown sugar, and straight up butter. The finish is a bit short, but leaves traces of wood sugars, vanilla, and, you guessed it, more delicious oak."
3.75,"Nose: vanilla caramel molasses with water cherry nuts nose gets oaky with water
Body: medium
Palate: woody, spicy caramel
Finish: medium
Note: doesn’t let long enough reminds me of Jefferson’s 18, is that the remount of time in the cask? Delicious"

4.25,"Get a huge smell of wood. Smells like an old leather bound book. That deep wood is also in the flavor. In the mouth I get tobacco, leather, with a great initial sweetness. Smooth and creamy with a long peppery finish. Very nice bourbon. Think I would like better with a slightly younger age. The woody flavor would be better if less powerful. But still excellent."
4.0,Heavy oak on the nose and tongue with a spicy long finish. Not complex and has a somewhat stale flavor as it evaporates off the tongue.
