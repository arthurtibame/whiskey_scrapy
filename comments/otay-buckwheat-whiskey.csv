2.5,"It’s been ages since I’ve opened a new bottle.  Been going through an immense backlog of samples.  But I braved putting on a face mask, and venturing into a wine store to buy some red wine for the pizza sauce I was making at home.  

While there, I noticed this strange little bottle on the shelf.  Nestled neatly between a variety of American craft whiskey offerings.  Buckwheat whiskey?  I like buckwheat pancakes.  Maybe this might be just as interesting.  And heck..$25 for a 375ml isn’t bad.   Theoretically I guess buckwheat isn’t a grain. It’s a seed.  So...this can’t be whiskey, but instead “spirit”.  Either way, seems interesting.  

Color is interesting...like a well aged Armagnac.  At first whiff, this is more like a brandy than whiskey.  I’m getting floral aromas mixed with some grape and oak.  Taste nothing like buckwheat pancakes.  But that’s not to say it’s not good.  It’s just different—-tastes of Cedar wood , some brandy flavor, allspice.  

Okay so—-this isn’t for fans of straight normal whiskey.  But if you’re looking to deviate from the norm, try something different, and not beak the bank for the experiment, this is well worth the try."
