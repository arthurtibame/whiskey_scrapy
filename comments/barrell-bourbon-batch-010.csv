4.0,"Excellent pour. The higher proof gives a nice warm feeling on the mouth and slightly in the chest! Mint flavors follow me with this. First on the nose, then at the first portion of the mouth. I get a strong orange zest similar to another review, as well as subtle nutmeg."

4.0,"Spearmint on the nose, and soap. Interesting palate... minty, with nutmeg, other baking spices, orange zest, some cedar, leather, and cola. Ends with pleasant bitterness. This is complex, and smooth for the proof, almost no hug. Niiiiiice. 5/27/18"
