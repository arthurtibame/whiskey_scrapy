3.0,"Tried this at a bar and this is definitely unique stuff. I had higher hopes I have to admit. It's not that it is bad it is just that the entire whiskey is overpowered by the predominant flavor of lemon. It's like what you would think an advertised ""lemon"" flavored whiskey would taste like. I will not put a bottle in my collection."
3.0,"Fruity nose without burn. Spicy start to the palate, but fruit and good sweetness develop as it swirls around your sinuses. The alcohol burn eases as it opens and it becomes more complex, with raisins and honey coming to the party. Finishes with some leathery bitterness that makes you want the next sip."
4.0,Sweet almost get a ice tea and butter notes.

3.0,"Batch 8. Has some cider notes on the nose, followed by a thick vanilla blanket. It kind of reminds me of a tamer, creamier Elijah Craig Small Batch. But then, I also get a faint whiff of curry. That's a new experience, never had that before in a whiskey. Taste is interesting, I get nutmeg, white pepper, wax, bubblegum, medicine, flowers. I'm all over the place with each sip, it's fairly complex, yet very smooth, and the mouthfeel is very soft. The flavors linger, with a tingling of spice, but the heat dissipates; not that 92-proof is high, but this doesn't drink like a 92-proofer. I'm actually not sure what ""great with food"" is supposed to look like in a whiskey, but if that means multi-layered I think Jefferson's and Chef Lee accomlished their goal. 4/14/17 
      A week later, and I'm still getting new and interesting notes with each sip. 4/20/17 
  This is still a headscratcher, in a good way. Complex. This time on the nose I get walnuts, cardamon, paprika. On the palate, it feels thin but creates a waxy texture on the tongue. I taste medicine, bubblegum, bitter chocolate, pepper, potpourri, salt. There's plenty of spice but not as much heat. It doesn't taste like the whiskeys I like yet it makes we want more. It's like the bourbon and rye components are constantly fighting to take the forefront. Layered and interesting. 5/23/17"

3.75,"Before I get into this review a couple of house cleaning items. First I am reviewing the 2018 release and specifically batch 14. Secondly the proof for this release is now 90 proof (versus the 92 proof represented here). This is a limited annual release from Jefferson. It's a blend of straight Rye and Kentucky Bourbon. While it is an NAS release we are told the components are up to 14 yrs old and based on the straight designation no less then 2 yrs old. As with all Jefferson products it's 100% sourced, the Bourbon disclosed as coming from Kentucky, however, no such disclosure on the Rye. Price point like a lot of Jefferson products varies wildly ($40-$65) with the average just north of $50 (price paid was $39.99). Unlike most Whiskey releases, the older releases of this one we're quite disjointed and not well reviewed. However, the 2017 and 2018 releases have received far better reviews and then consensus that it's a much improved blend now. So let's see if I agree, on to the tasting:
On the palatte it's buttery and rich with vanilla, toffee, dark fresh cherries with clove and pepper in the background. As we move thru to the mid palette, we get a big heavily toasted oak that provides a slight campfire smoke note to compliment the brown sugar and rye spice. The finish is long with oak and black pepper leading it with toffee coming back as well. The finish lingers with the oak and black pepper staying on the tongue for a long while. 
I have to be honest, I really wasn't expecting much from this Whiskey. I had a pour a couple years back and remember it being disjointed and honestly just plain crap. So to now taste the improvement is a real credit to the blenders at Jefferson's. There are clearly old Whiskey components as these are not young notes especially from the Rye. No dill, red hots or mint notes to be found. 
All in all this is a really enjoyable pour that whilst not doing anything remarkable is hard to put down. 
As always, I factor the price paid in my overall rating and while it's not overly complex, that finish is outstanding for a $40 Whiskey. Just short of a 4+ star dram, but one that any Rye or Bourbon fan would enjoy if you can find it for under $50. 
Cheers all!"

3.5,"This year for the holidays I’m going to try a brand new whiskey every day in December. #lifegoals

Dec. 20

So you might be wondering what this little guy has to do with the number 20. Fun fact: when you hold this next to a Barterhouse 20 on December 20th, you realize that you CAN bear to pop the top on this bottle.

Nose is sugary. Honestly reminds me of gummy bears, and I like that concept more than I think I should. I get grape jam. Small hint of pickle juice, probably from a rye mixed in.

Body is very sweet. I get where that gummy bear/grape jam was coming from. As a flavor, I’d say it’s more of a raisin, but when you mix in that rye influence, it tricks your taste buds. I can get gummy bears, figs, prunes, sangria, all kinds of screwy stuff. I don’t love too many of the flavors, but I do find it interesting.

Finish is dry like a red wine, with a bit of anise and licorice. Some of that brine comes back in the end.

I find this interesting and complex. I can see the artistry, but to be honest, I don’t care for the flavor profiles. I’m quite certain there are people that would love this, but not me.

‘Tis the season. I don’t know if I actually have 11 more new whiskeys lined up, so if you’re reading this and there’s something readily available out there you’d like me to enjoy/suffer through this holiday season, leave it in the comments. Don’t say WLW. I lied, I have 2."
