2.0,"The palate is a cacophony of red fruits, and even a pseudo-sherry flavor (how did that get there?).  There's a tanginess that emerges in the mid-palate that suggests that perhaps things will turn out all right.  However, this is soon subsumed by the deluge of cloying sweetness.  Simply not to my taste."

2.0,"Nose - Sweet malt, almost bourbon-like vanilla, toasted white bread, faint toasted/baked apple with skin/core.

Taste - Sweet spicy apple/pear cider, lightly drying cinnamon oak, faint creamy apple custard, hint of flamed orange zest, light fruity bitterness.

Finish - Lingering buttery creamy apple/orange custard, charred cinnamon bitterness, white peper heat, lingering sweet orange/vanilla simple that leans a bit splenda-ish.

Score - 72/100

Final Thoughts - This was quite interesting on the nose as if I think if I nosed it blind, I would almost peg it as a high barley content bourbon. It has a very sweet vanilla bourbon-like notes, but a yeasty malty toasted bread is also very strongly present too. Mouthfeel is great in that it is somehow creamy/buttery, yet drying at the same time. It's quite strange, but very pleasant. Not sure I'm a huge fan of the combination on the palate, but it's got a nice orchard fruit/custard vibe to it, but what throws it off is that there's this overall splenda-like sweetness from start to finish. If this is considered a step up from their ""standard"" offering, I think I'll pass on them as a whole. This is a dram that I'd drink if my only other options were things like Dewar's White or A.D. Laws."

4.0,"Stranahan's hasn't let me down yet. I love their entry-level whiskey, as well as the single barrel incarnation of it that I tried; this, their ostensible step up from the flagship, is every bit as good, if not slightly better. The mint and dark chocolate notes that seem to be hallmarks of the house style come across even more boldly here, especially the mint. There's a deep, dark fruitiness, too - not quite into dried fig territory yet, but definitely raisiny. The finish is lovely, ever so slightly hot, with the minty freshness taking a long ride into a mountain sunset. Excellent whiskey, well worth the $60 I paid for the bottle."

Regardless, this is a bottle I always will come back to and will have a place on my shelf. Just wow."

4.0,"Went and visited a friend in Colorado who knows I am a big bourbon fan. He had picked up a bottle not realizing this wasn’t a bourbon but a single malt. Decided to give it a try and was pleasantly surprised. Had a really nice flavor profile, got hints of banana and caramel. Had a nice finish and was very drinkable. Inspired me to take a trip to the distillery and try a few of their others. A bit pricy (about $70 a bottle) but not over the top for a hand bottled craft whisky. Definitely worth a try."

3.0,"Wanted a change of pace and figured I'd give this American Single malt a try! While a single malt (100% malted barley), it is aged like a Bourbon in new #3 char American oak barrels. At 94 proof, it's also proofed like a Bourbon. Based on this I am expecting a cross between a classic single malt and a Bourbon. This is exactly what you get!. Upon entry you get classic malt notes with a hint of smoke, that quickly moves to rich caramel and vanilla spice. Mid pallette has some honey and smoked marshmallow, almost like a smore! Finish is pretty long and has some more sweet spice with a hint of sweet mint.
Really nice pour! It's definitely a sweet whiskey (even for a Bourbon drinker) but makes for a great change of pace! Would I pay $75 for this bottle? No. Would I get another $9 pour? Absolutely! 3.5/5"

3.75,"It’s probably worth noting that this pour has been exposed to prolonged cool outside air. The color is on the darker side for a Scotch. The nose has a huge chocolate covered cherry aroma.  Subtle cherry notes on first sip with mild oak on the finish. The mouthfeel is full, but not quite to a Highland 18 level. This is a nice, moderately-rich, unique option to a standard Scotch. 3.76."

3.0,"Thanks to @The_Rev , I got a generous sample to try this.  With my regular trips to Denver, I’ve been meaning to actually visit Stranahan’s, but my schedule generally only involves office to hotel back to office.  Till then, this will have to do.  I believe that the most noteworthy American single malt distilleries are Westland and Stranahan’s...the others can’t even come close.  Products like this will just continue to get better as it ages more in the barrels.  This one brings flavors of brown sugar, some mint, marzipan.  Well made, but young...can do with some age to take off the roughness and slightly bitter finish.  Till this ages, I’m going to instead try their sherry cask, which I’ve heard is better, but what I’d really like to get my hands on is their annual Snowflake, which is reportedly amazing enough to have lines overnight.  Thanks @The_Rev for the pour!"

Not a fan of Stranahan’s at all. Thought a “diamond” upgrade might add something, but it fell flat. If you like the spicy raw taste of a rye, maybe this is good for you. 

Not smooth, may mix well."

4.0,"The nose is barrel char and fruity notes - banana?  Rubbing alcohol.

On the palate this is very chocolatey, bitter dark chocolate, rubbing alcohol, char, dry oak.

The finish is long with bitter chocolate, wood, and grass.

Some of the more bitter flavors run a little too wild in the end for my taste, but I can appreciate this in that it's different.

Edit: I normally don't add water to stuff below the mid 50s ABV, but I did in this case, and it makes a world of difference- the nose becomes very malty, with hints of spice, and a little bitter chocolate.  The change in taste is even more dramatic.  The barley malt really jumps forward, and the bitter chocolate notes take a back seat.  It has a nice spice, somewhere between ground ginger and white pepper, and develops a sour apple character.

The finish is spice, malt, oak, and just a hint of baking chocolate.

I would not drink this again without water, but with it, it's almost a different spirit."
