4.0,"It's a sweet, almost tart, offering out of AD Laws. Thick with over ripened red cherries, cinnamon roll icing, baking soda, and rocky mtn. snowmelt.
Laws Whiskey House is quickly becoming the best whiskey maker in Colorado, maybe the Mountain time zone!"

5.0,"I had to grow into this one. My initial pour felt very scotch-like.  Now, I'm getting more complex sugars and subtle rye, vanilla, mint on my 3rd pour.  Halfway through the bottle and it's better than ever.  If you get a bottle and don't like it..give it some 'air time' and give it a second opinion. I'm looking forward to seeing some older bottling of this recipe and trying some other products from A.D. Laws"

Taste: sweet that turns into a fun, complex spice before settling into a toasted bread crust
Finish: long spice that gradually lightens"
