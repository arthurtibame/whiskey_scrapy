4.75,"The nose has strong but subtle notes of toffee and vanilla, both perfectly balanced. Orange, caramel and pepper dominate the palate in a mouth coating, balanced fashion. The finish is long with pepper and orange and fades away very gently. Sublime."

4.75,"We all have prejudices in life. For a brief time mine was grains, blends and anything not single malt, a group I thought merited little attention. Like a blow torch taken to ice my prejudices started melting and melting fast...Pot still Irish whiskey, Compass Box, Boutique Whiskey and now this majestic whiskey from a closed in 1988 Edinburgh grain distillery. Really, really interesting. Waxy, earwax, candle wax taste....wax, wax....and hazelnut. I really like it. Many years well spent. I've never tasted a dram like this. 35 years old and very reasonable price at under $200. 4.75."
