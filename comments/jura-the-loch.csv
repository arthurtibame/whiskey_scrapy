4.25,"""Is this a peaty dalmore?""

What a shame to give it only a 4.0. 

It is so sad for such a good dram as this one. I have truly enjoyed it. I would definitively recommend it.

Bottled at 44.5% abv. Polished mahogany. 

It has been matured in casks that previously held Pedro Ximenez sherry for 30 years. WOW.

On the nose it is great. Super sherried but mostly Raisins. The notes are: Dark fruits, Raisins, Slight heather peat, Dry brown grass, Red fruits also present, Berries and those chocolate covered raisins called Raisinets. 

On the palate is WONDERFUL. Divine flavor. I really enjoyed it. I kept it on my mouth for as long as i could. Chocolate, Pepper spice, Sherry, Raisins Delicious,
Peat is not powerful, mostly Heather peat. Full score here.

Well.... where it lost most of its points....

aftertaste is very, very, very dim. Short maybe. It really is dim. It gives you that mouth sensation of overly eating raisings. You can even feel the pieces of raisins. Clove and the smallest hint of salt. It could be longer. It could be stronger. 

Overall, i give this lovely dram an 85 over 100. Surely it feels like more."
3.5,"Sherry right up front! Decent, but nothing that stays with you, except a hint of pepper."
