4.0,"Let me first say that if possible i would've given this a 3.7 or 3.8, instead of a 4 star rating. That being said, this scotch is a good one. Very fruty and floral nose, with some caramel and slight vanilla notes which together make for a nice balanced experience. There's a bit of alcohol smell which kind of reveals that some younger whisky is inside this single malt, not unpleasent at all but it does hit you a bit. On the palate the aclohol makes itself present in the beginning  but quickly turns into caramel and oak which then gives place to a nice sweet oaky finish with hints of sherry. 
 Be PATIENT! The first time i opened the bottle and sampled this i didn't like it much but after it's been opened it develops in a good way so don't be afraid if your first dram is not what you expected. I've seen that in general there are some mixed reviews of this Glenlivet Solera maybe because there's some inconsistency which makes some bottles better than other ones. Thankfully i'm enjoying mine although i found it a bit expensive at 67,50 Euros. Somewhere between 40 and 50 would've been more in line with what you're getting."

3.0,"This is the poor man's Glenfiddich 15. While nice and gentle, the body is weak and the finish short.

Vanilla, some dried fruit and caramel... Not bad."

4.25,"One of the 3 retail market releases from Glenlivet, the ""middle price one"" this is a Solera Vatted expression, actually the best aroma in glenlivet. 40%abv

Beautiful aroma, Honey, Vanilla cream, lots of Peanut butter, Fragant as flowers, Prunes, Wedding cake, So so sweet, Could stay hours just nosing this.

On the palate it is a little simple, Bitter notes, cereal, Oak and Peanut butter. Finish short but surprisingly smoky, ashy. nice.

Overall it is fair to give this dram an 86 over 100. I would buy another bottle because it is easy to pair with food."
