2.5,"Got a bit better after the bottle got about half way down after a couple of weeks. I usually have a big bottle of blended scotch that I use to help me save the good stuff. This is just ok, and I won’t buy it again, it’s not horrible it’s just not very good, it’s not sweet or bitter or smoky, nothing really stands out. 

My go-to cheap blends are Balentines or Whyte & Mackay, but I like trying stuff I haven’t tried yet, I got this and was immediately disappointed, I’ll go back to my go-to’s next bottle."

2.75,Sweet blend. Not much substance though. Orange peel in the finish. Solid for the price!

1.0,"Honestly, smells like a latex condom filled with malt. Taste is malt, barley, wheat, grass, oats, and maybe the odd milkweed. None of which are ready for harvest. Finish? There is no finish, at all. Incredibly disappointing!!"
