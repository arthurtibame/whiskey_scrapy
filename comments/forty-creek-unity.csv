4.0,"Dad just bought a Quinta Ruban from glenmorangie so we did a blind tasting we liked Quinta Ruban port barrel better by a bit finish is a little better it was smoother and a hint of peaty goodness, but this was fresh sweet and balanced maybe a few more years in a barrel would put it ahead a point! Excellent experiment !"

4.0,I’ll start by saying I love port and port influenced whiskey! This is an excellent balance of port and whiskey sweet and chocolatey almost dessert like but a rye finish balances it out. Smells amazing!! I Like Quinta Ruban from glennorangie more at 4.5 and signet at 5 of that helps as reference and at that price of 79 that’s almost Quinta Ruban and at $70 the Wisers 18 destroys it so should be like a $50-60 dollar bottle but is unique enough to try and has a cool back story!

4.5,"Nose: Pretty typical Canadian whisky - maple, vanilla, caramel, some nutmeg and baking spice.  Some additional subtle bourbony richness, presumably from the corn whisky.  Very pleasant.

Palate: Nice creamy mouthfeel.  More maple initially with some caramel sweetness.  Nice tingle on the sides of the tongue and the back of the palate, presumably from the port, and some nice rye spice comes through. Very smooth, lots of flavour. 

Finish: Quite long. Vanilla followed by bitter orange peel especially perceptible on the roof of the mouth. 

This is a great well-balanced whisky!"
