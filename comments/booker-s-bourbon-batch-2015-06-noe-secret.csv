3.5,"Yep, sweet corn pops and salty caramel. Lots of heat. Hint of the standard Beam cherry syrup as well, but not as much as other batches. Slight turpentine as well. 4/12/19"

4.5,"Smell of caramel and vanilla.
Tasting...bite of alcohol and a flavor I can’t put my finger on. Then, a sweetness...butterscotch?"

4.0,Powerful stuff but still pretty complex.  I'm a fan
5.0,Surprisingly smooth. So complex I feel like I'll need another bottle to understand it. Is this heaven?

5.0,"Disappointed at first, but a few days after opening the bottle, it really blossomed--this is one of the best bourbons I have ever had....reminds me of the 2015 George T. Stagg."

2.0,Flame thrower ! Abundance of heat and spices on the palate. With nuances of chocolate. You will need a ice cube or two or three. Looking forward  to tasting the other batches

4.0,"I get a sweet melon scent on the nose, again far less astringent that I would expect for the ABV. There’s honey and lemon on the body, and I get a leathery, charred-oak finish. I don’t know how they do this, but I get an oily body and dry finish. Big fan of the mouth feel on this one!"

4.0,Wow very hot with the high proof. Needs some water to really bring out the flavor and nose. Light carmel flavor with toasted cereal. The nose has lots of char with a sweet lingering scent.

4.0,Cigar box and leather on the nose complimented by rich apples and cinnamon on the palate. Possibly the best bottle of bourbon I ever bought.

3.0,"On ice: Mild sweet oak nose. Sweet corn & oak flavor with a touch of caramel & black pepper. Oak dominated finish. Oak lingering flavor with notes of sweetness & pepper.
At BJ's Mesquite, TX. $12.95 for 2oz.
Recommend to anyone who wants a oak forward bourbon."

4.0,"Appropriately, Noe Secret needs to be shared. 

I’ve tried Booker’s in the past and the experience wasn’t all that enjoyable. It was harsh, clumsy and felt like the guy crushing cans on his forehead near the pool. Fun to have at the party, but definitely not what makes the party great. This entry forced me to look at Booker’s with new eyes. 

Truth be told, this has an incredibly smooth entry, great flavor, and precision sweetness. You’ll find your standard lineup: rich caramel, buttery toffee, oak, and some intense spice.

On the palate, this one enters rather mildly and slips down easy. 

What comes next might make you giggle a bit. This one is a coal in your chest, comical and surprising while still maintaining a semblance of craftsmanship and composure. I couldn’t help but smile and thoroughly enjoy the experience.

While this isn’t for everyone, if you want an intense bourbon outing, this one is for you.

4.0,Sweet Carmelly. Hot even with ice but mellowed with wood and spices. Peppery woody finish.
