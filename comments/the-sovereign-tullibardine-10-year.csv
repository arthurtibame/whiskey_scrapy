4.0,"This is a single malt from a single cask, non chill-filtered, natural color and bottled at cask strength, 58.6 abv. Bottle 45 of 270. 
First thing I noticed on the nose was the powdered chocolate which was followed by some stone fruits and citrus. The palate was hot, I mean really hot, my first sip burned all the way down my gullet. I added a teaspoon of water which calmed the heat, the palate then displayed vanilla, apricot and other stone fruits. The finish lingered a long time with the stone fruits and chocolate making a reprise."
