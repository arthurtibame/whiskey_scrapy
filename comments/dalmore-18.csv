4.0,"I have Dalmore 25, 12, and King Alexander in my collection. All of them are full-bodied, and in a way that surprises (especially for the 25). The 18 is very different - lighter, more subtle, gentle on the nose and palate with a modest finish. Spice is present, but not overdone, nuts, a hint of fruit and chocolate. Altogether a different experience. Very enjoyable, but complementary, rather than representative!"

4.0,"Incredible nose, deep rich sweet caramel drizzle, warm vanilla. Slightly burnt raisin oatmeal cookies. Dusty old New England cider mill. Faint smoke, but not peat or charcoal... cigar ash? Some reference 'coffee' but my amateur skills don't detect it (and I prefer French-pressed, strong enough to float a spoon). Palate is immediate: Salted caramel and citrus, a bit diaphanous, but smooth as silk and mouth-watering. Noticeable mineral note, surprisingly bitter (perhaps even a touch over-oaked). Huge finish, starts bittersweet with a wash of menthol and mint, then a wake of oak spices and more salt. Lingering floral note at the very end. Sample generously shared by a courageous old friend who's not afraid to open a pricey bottle now and then. If life is made for living, whisky is made for DRINKING!

From the nose I could tell it was a sherry bomb, but I could sense that it was going to be balanced by other aspects as well. On the palate, I got fresh cut cigars, chocolate, vanilla, raisins, cashews,  and mind blowing citrus. Finish is an all day/all night festival, and it was still going after water and a biscuit.

4.0,"So, it happens that this bottle was chosen to be opened in celebration of my birthday two weeks ago.  My buddy Paul suggested I let fate decide after we both assembled a short list of 8 fantastic bottles to choose from for my celebration.  In the spirit of March Madness, I did a bracket style competition using coin flips to arrive at the Dalmore 18.

This highland malt was bottled at 43% and in the traditional style of Dalmore- is chill filtered and has added color to make it a shimmering, ruby and copper concoction.  I paid just under $185 when I bought this bottle a couple of years ago.

The nose is an incredible balance of dark chocolate, toffee, sweet sherry and a hint of oak.  The nose is very inviting and luscious.  The palate is chocolate and toffee rich, while staying somewhat oily.  The bitterest sherry notes invade around mid sip and give this dram its only strikes.  The wood bites you on the back end, as well.  The finish is long, woody and bitter.  The heat builds slowly and overtakes the bitterness and pushes it away, which is a welcome thing IMO.

I added a little water in the hopes it would eliminate the bitterness.  It allowed more chocolate to come through on the nose, calmed some of the bitter oak on that palate but it killed all the heat on the finish- which I didn’t really like.

Overall, this suffers from the same issue I’ve had with almost every Dalmore I’ve tried to this point- the palate feels more harsh than it should.  This being 18 years old should not suffer from the same shortcomings as a young or NAS whisky.  This has to be something directly tied to the actual spirit itself, and not the barrels, finishes, etc.  It makes me very leery to try the older bottles I have in my collection:  the King Alexander and the 25yo.  I feel like they’re going to suffer the same fate.  This is a solid 4 star dram, but at some point Dalmore should be inching higher, they just aren’t.  That’s what makes this a disappointment.  I want a 5 star Dalmore, dammit."

4.0,"Dalmore probably tests the limits of my price tolerance for scotch at each age level, with the 18 fetching a steep $150+ in the States.  But it epitomizes for me the benefits of sherry aging in a scotch.  The nose immediately announces its sherry influence, and the palate follows through, with craisins and grape preserve, but also a bit of white chocolate or frosting-like sweetness.  The best part is that the flavors are crisp and clean, somehow less muddied or muddled than in some other sherried scotches.  The finish has a pleasant dryness, a little licorice, and lingers without overlasting its welcome.  At $100 or so, its price in the UK, this is well worth the price.  At $150, I'd opt for the occasional taste in a bar or, better yet, an event where someone else picks up the tab."

Strong sherried nose with orange peel, raisins and dark chocolate. On the palate it is liquid Christmas cake but with a spicy edge that avoid the experience to be overly sweet. Yeah, I know about the little bitterness to be found somewhere along the dram, chill filtering and colorant added but to be honest I couldn't care less... :)

So yes, a full five star score from me, no regrets. This is on my Top 5 list!

Start throwing the stones! ;-)

Tip: try to pair it with some really dark chocolate (80-90%). Just sublime."

3.75,"The Christmas weekend begins and I will start it with this 18 year provided by @LeeEvolved some time ago. My recent sampling’s of Dalmore, for the most part, have been underwhelming; especially with the overwhelming price.  I do look forward to this, however.  This is not a scotch that one has the good fortune of tasting.

The color is rich amber. 

Nosing in the stemmed Dalmore copita glass that was given out to all at a tasting I previously mentioned. After a good amount of time, rich fruits and nuts make to core of the nose.  Tangerine and caramel initially arrive paving the way for more aromas.  Balanced sherry notes of plumbs, raisins, pecans all with cinnamon spice sprinkled throughout.  Creamy chocolate and orchard fruits emerge in due time.  Traces of oak are faint and add a nice wrapper for these aromas. A busy nose that could be inhaled all day. 

The body is lightweight which throws you off because the nose is so rich. An oaky, spicy arrival on the palate. Cinnamon, almonds, raisins, oranges with a touch of sweetness:  Vanilla, caramel and sugar glazing.  The sweetness becomes stronger over time. The palate does not last or hold for any good length. It takes several sips and swooshes to extract the flavors because of the semi short palate lifespan. 

The finish is woody and drying with some sherry and vanilla which last for a fair length.  A slight orange bitterness at the far end of the finish and a touch of cognac. 

As with a Dalmore, the nose is rich, vivid and everlasting.  The palate fails to deliver the promise of the nose but what does come through is quite well and nicely balanced.  Soft and somewhat delicate.  If palate could only reach deeper and be more viscous, this could be mind blowing.  Time and patience are rewarded with this scotch.  This one took me a good hour plus to work the nose and palate. Now, would I pay the near $200 for this?  Most certainly no. This, though, is the favorite of all the  Dalmore’s I have tasted and am fortunate to had the time to enjoy. Thanks again @LeeEvolved. [Tasted: 12/21/18][87/100]"
4.25,"I found this Dalmore to be a step aside from the bulk of the Dalmore range. There are citrus notes but more prevalent are the rich and dark flavours, I personally noted Dark Chocolate and Coffee with a touch of Cinnamon. For me the citrus notes were more a part of the aroma and finish and expressed as more an apricot than anything else.
Overall, I enjoyed it and believe it is worth the try!"

4.0,"Nose: A warm, velvety, enfolding blanket of sherry. Orange juice and orange zest, raisins, old oak, dusky cinnamon, vanilla and a faint whiff of ash. It's an impressive nose right from the start and it increases in interest over time as it develops in the glass. There are also brown sugar and maple syrup notes that are curiously like a bourbon nose. You almost miss it behind the sherry but think ""bourbon"" when sniffing this and the similarity is immediate. [The dry glass aroma is pure maple syrup].

Palate: A sweet orange preserve and sherry arrival with salted caramel, chocolate-covered raisins, almonds and dried figs. The development brings out chocolate, honey and woody notes, with a little hot spice and tannic bitterness creeping in towards the finish.

Finish: Medium/long. Sherry, dried fruit, orange, milk coffee and lingering oak with a bitter cocoa edge and a tiny hint of mint.

There's an intriguing mix of sweet and dry in this whisky, which is key to its character. On the one hand there is a wave of sweet citrus and rich fruity flavours, coupled with sweet sherry. However this would be cloying and undrinkable without the presence of the cocoa, pepper and oak tannin, which provide a dry counterbalance.

Water does not improve this whisky. The nose disappears and the palate becomes generically sweet and almost saccharine like artificially sweetened chocolate. Take this one neat.

It's a good example of a Dalmore, but in my humble opinion if you've tasted one, you've tasted them all, and there are cheaper expressions. Still, fair do's - it's a very good whisky and just makes 4 stars.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

I was a bit underwhelmed with the 15, so let's see if this 18 does better. 
Needles to mention the beautiful but artificial colour of this one. 
The 18 years of maturation was done in three stages. First 14Y in American white oak, then 3Y in Matusalem sherry casks with a finish of 1Y in a sherry but. 

Only nice stuff is detectable at first nosing.
A very nice sweet orange and a powerful vanilla cinnamon. Nutmeg and clove add the spicy part. Coffee, chocolate and sultana finish of this lovely nosing.
Wow nice stuff.

The palate offers more of the same nice components. 
Cinnamon citrus and chocolate raisins rule, but are complemented with sherry, vanilla, coffee and nutmeg. Lovely stuff.

The long finish is a bit oaky dry, but nothing to worry about. Lots of nice stuff play part in this nice finish. Amongst others I could find citrus and apple, soft spicy liquorice, toffee honey and chocolate covered nuts.
Wow!

A very nice expression by Dalmore. 
But as many others before me have said, this one could have been great with some extra horsepower and without the ridiculus additional colouring.

5.0,"Continuing the early bonus samples for this round of the Scottish Distillery Tour, which officially enters round 6 three days from today. Dalmore 18 was provided by Lee after he selected it to be a celebratory bottle for his birthday last month and he graciously decided to share it with the group. This Highland single malt is bottled at 43% ABV and like all standard Dalmore’s, it is chill filtered and heavily colored. I must say the color is a fabulous dark mahogany. 

Right off the bat the nose presents itself as well matured, rich and wonderful. Oak and spices, beautiful sherry, rich chocolate and mixed nuts. Raisins, brown sugar, honeyed dates and thick maple syrup. Dark and flavorful oranges, pears dusted with cinnamon and a nice pecan pie. For the first ounce I let the nose rest a good 15-20 minutes, but the second pour I went right in. Powdered ginger and an unexpected candied bacon note greeted me. I could nose this all day. 

The palate was not quite as impressive, but in no way was it bad. Sherry and light oak. Raisins, chocolate, toffee, maple syrup and a light coffee. Wood spice, light oranges and tangerines. Nutty, baking spices and more oak, toasted oak. Luxury in a glass. 

The mouthfeel went through some changes as the dram went. At first it was quite thin and watery. Subsequent sips revealed a nice medium body with an increasingly oily texture and it became mouthwatering. 
The finish is medium long. Sherry, raisins, syrup and dry. A hint of oak tannins but not bad and really to be expected at 18 years of age. 

I both wanted to love this one and hate it at the same time, much like my attitude towards Macallan. It’s good, no, it’s great, and they know it’s great and I hate that about Dalmore, and Macallan. Yes there are some expressions, maybe more than there should be, out there that are subpar, but you have to give credit where credit is due. This 18 deserves praise. I can’t say the price is justified, but it’s close. I believe I can get a 1L bottle at duty free for about $180. I don’t think that’s too bad, but anything more I would say no. Now, you dump the colorant, nix the chill filtration and bump the ABV to 46%...watch out because that would fly off of the shelves. Still, I’m giving this a 4.5 and I would say that on a good night this could contend with Macallan’s Rare Cask. Many thanks for the sample @LeeEvolved, it was thoroughly enjoyed.

5.0,"Whisk(e)y: The Dalmore - 18

Nose:

Vanilla and subtle dark chocolate are at the forefront. 

Palate:

Immediately you can taste walnuts, subtle coffee ...almost with a cream to it. No heat on the tongue or when swallowed whatsoever. The Dalmore 18 is my favourite out of their line up. It has some complexity to it but nothing difficult to nose and tell from an experienced drinker. This is a worthy dram with so much taste. It’s bottled at 43% which makes it quite smooth and approachable from The Dalmore 12. 
I highly recommend buying a bottle of this. No need to buy a dram at the bar. Great for any collector or someone venturing into the Scotch field. This one lives up to the name and the hype...just not the price tag difference from The Dalmore 12. Yowza!

The 12 is a daily sipper this one could too if not for the price. This became my fave Dalmore that I would serve only on special occassions. I know this sometimes be found costing north of $200. At that price point I would not buy it again but I highly recommend this if you can get it close to MSRP.

This one initially I was impressed but the longer I drank it the predominant notes were as Jose mentioned old citric, drying white peppered bitter wood. The aftertaste it left in my mouth not really pleasant. I'm thinking 3.5 max for this one as well in fact by the end i thought even less and tipped the rest. And that ladies and gentlemen is the last of my Dalmore samples I have in my collection. I've tried several and nearly all i've found wanting bar the cigar malt. Not a distillery I will pay money for too try again...ever.."

3.75,"A bit peaty, despite it not being peated.  Smooth albeit a tad bitter. Nice long finish. Probably prefer the 12."
4.0,"Of all the times to be in Edinburgh, and I'm here on Burns Night! I passed on the haggis (again, if there was ever a time to do it)... but the Dalmore 18 was my dram of choice to toast dear old Robbie after dinner at The Royal Mile Tavern. It earns 4 stars for context alone."

2.0,"Full bodied on the nose. Just the right amount of peat, mixed with fruit. First sip: big and sweet on the entry, fades slightly towards the mid-pallet, then transitions to nuts on the back of the pallet. A little warmer finish than I expected, but not in an unpleasant way. Second sip was consistent with the first. The transition to nutty is very abrupt and kind of fun. But the transition to the finish comes out as buttery peanut butter and that’s not really my vibe. I don’t like it enough to want to finish it. If the back end (transition to finish and finish) were different, I’d be a fan. Unfortunately, I am not."

4.0,"One of our local liquor stores accidentally got small 100 ml bottles of this whiskey.

This one starts of with the scent of dried blueberries, dark chocolate pudding and honey.

The taste is very soft to the pallet tasting of roasted bananas in a nutty banana bread and a fresh cream.

The finish took a 90 degree turn for me to sweet cloves and honey with the tiniest hint of ginger root."

4.5,"A fine fancy Whisky. Almost a 5.0, with a nose very different than the palate, you can easily determine that it has been beautifully crafted. 

Bottled at 43%abv, with an auburn polished mahogany.

On the nose is very special. Fresh cherry syrup (that's a first), recently baked vanilla cake, slight sweet liquorice note, jelly beans, nutmeg, sugar. Lovely aroma but a little dim.

On the palate, is fine but i believe it could be better. Starts with old citric notes, Oranges and Old raisins. Woody very woody. Bonfire finish, Ashy finish.

Fancy and a little dry, has a slight peppery note. Finish is very long, that being the best perk of this dram. 

Overall this elegant dram is a 94 over 100, nice score suitable for one of my favorite brands. Cheers!"

What is the best distillery?  Springbank.  I’ve already said that, and wrote a love poem for Longrow 18.  But, what is the worst distillery?  Dalmore.  Get ready for  slander.

Some background.  I have tried the Dalmore 12, 15, 18, and King Alexander III.  They are all garbage.  It has always perplexed me how Dalmore continues to exist as a distillery.  Macallan is Macallan; Dalmore is not Macallan.  Dalmore serves a disgusting niche for people with no interest in taste; but with an interest in luxury, and not enough money to afford Macallan.  This 18 year old is the only bottle of Dalmore that I have bought, and I thought I could get a good deal because I found this bottle lost at a Canadian Duty Free for about 120 USD.  This was clearly a lost bottle from Europe because it was 70 cL rather than 750 mL; and rather than send it back to Europe, I guess they just decided to dump it at a deep discount.  The regular price for Dalmore 18 is 200-250 USD.

Clearly, I still feel ripped off.  But, some more background: Richard Paterson, the master blender at Dalmore, is a jackass.  I cannot believe how many Scotch drinkers idolize this man.  He is disgusting, and he is the last person I want to bump into when I am enjoying whisky.  So, here’s a YouTube video to illustrate what I mean:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDS-InpmEnM

He has many videos about “How to Taste Whisky”, but this is the best, because it is short, and I know the Canadian host, Sophie Liu.  The video is hilarious in a cringe kind of way.  Paterson is dressed in full pervert pilot swag and Sophie is honestly concerned that he might rape her, questioning his Dalmore sample with, “It’s from a vial with no label on it…”  But, anyway, my biggest problem with Paterson is not that he does not know how to behave around whisky or around women, but it’s because by throwing whisky around the room as a joke, he has no respect as a guest of someone else’s home or workplace.  It’s okay that he has no respect for his own Dalmore, because it is garbage, but show some respect for the people who have to clean up after you.

Nosing this whisky…  Hello.  How are you?  Quite well.  Thank you very much.  Dalmore 18 actually has a very nice nose.  Sultanas, red citrus, Hermes perfume, prunes, la patisserie, a well-seasoned wood cutting board.  Tasting this whisky… Ey yo.  What’s up?  This sucks.  Fuck you too.  This thing completely falls apart.  At best, the palate is watery and boring, but then there’s this plastic cherry note that takes me on a nightmare-worthy trip of $9 old-fashioned’s, cheap birthday cakes, and fatty liver disease.  Some nice red citrus flavors try to make a reappearance on the finish, but it is dominated by this soulcrushing essence of garbage.  I don’t know how to explain it any better.  Perhaps: depression.  This whisky tastes like depression.

I actually cannot give this whisky a minus rating because the nose is nice.  And I actually cannot tell you how I REALLY feel about this whisky or Dalmore distillery because my wife likes this.

Score: 0 (forgettable)
