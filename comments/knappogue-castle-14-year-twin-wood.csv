4.0,"I was able to locate a bottle and add to collection and opened this St. Pattys weekend. Tropical fruits (coconut and pineapples), brown sugar, vanilla deliver a nose of sweetness and draw you in for your taste.  The sugary sweetness carries over into the palate and slowly transforms through the tropical and finally lands of the spice and oak. The spiciness crescendos rapidly and the palate is left slightly dry and oaky. Tasted this right after sampling the 12 year sibling.  The texture has the same creamy feel on the palate.  However, the fruity and sherry sweetness differentiated from the 12 year old.  Adding an ice cube or drop of water totally changed this dram and the sweetness was greatly accentuated taking this to the next level. I enjoyed this greatly over ice and recommend sipping it only over ice. [$57][88/100][Opened: 3/20/16][Whisky on the Hudson 9/18/14]"

4.0,"Nose is predominately vanilla and oak.  Mouthfeel is thin.  Initial taste is spicy with cinnamon that turns syrupy.  Slightly harsh finish which immediately turns into apples, honey, and more cinnamon.  Very fruity, reminds me of an applesauce or apple pie.  Great sipper by itself, just wish the finish was milder."

4.0,"This is a nice Irish whiskey; it's not better or worse than the 12, just different. The nose has nice hints of ripe peaches and white glue (sounds crazy but actually works really well), with pears and caramel becoming evident on the palate. The body is light and refreshing, leading me to believe that this dram wound play nice with a few ice cubes, and the finish is quite satisfying with wood notes finally making their presence known. I really like it!"

4.0,"Excellent Irish Whiskey. Not an aficionado on Irish whiskeys, but I’ve had the likes of Jameson, Greenspot, Redbreast and some others, but this by far my favorite. Reminds me of a Speyside single malt scotch, with more floral and vanilla notes. At 46 ABV you could add a drop of water, I prefer it neat in a Glencairn. Highly recommended!"

4.0,"Great double barrel whiskey, a flavorful Irish spirit"
4.0,"Great grassy, slightly loamy. Very easy to drink"
4.0,"Twin wood is well named because I really get two provinces of flavors that get married really nicely. 

The nose has a really rich quality of caramel and cocoa, dark fruits, but also a bit of biting herbaceous astringency.

Entry is honey sweet with melon, followed by lemon, grassy, mint, mineral water, black pepper. Then the finish is back to rounded earthier flavors like chocolate and coffee.

The best summation of the experience is like a salted dark chocolate and a dried cranberry consumed at the same time. Very enjoyable."

3.5,"Ah Eire. Many moons ago as a fresh 20 something year old I lived there for 3 years, met my wife amongst a flat of up to a dozen at anytime flatmates  (was a big old house), drank many a pint of Guinness, discovered whiskey wasn't that as terrible as I thought (very well watered down not neat...it took another decade to achieve that and truly drink whiskey) and now here back in NZ I crack open a sample of a brand which wasn't in existence when I was there. To be honest there was only 3 or 4 distilleries and limited brands in those days. Fast forward and the diversity is mind boggling. Now the whiskey at hand...is it any good. Hmm...not bad but not Redbreast, Yellow Spot good either.  Mild bitterness mentioned in the 12 year in reviews comes through here...not massively but enough to slightly overpower and distract from the rest of the dram. The potstilled nature comes through, vanilla, bit of pepper, very mild sherry influence. I'd give it a 3.5 but couldn't round to a 4. Not bad value at just over $80USD"

5.0,Knappogue Castle is one of my favorite distilleries in the whiskey world. And this one is no exception. Green apple on the nose and palate. Vanilla on the finish. And it's a great finish. Remarkably little alcohol burn at 46%. This is one of the best values in whiskey and one of my favorite Irish whiskies.

4.0,"Milder Geruch nach Frucht, dabei Apfel zu erkennen. Interessante Säure in der Nase.

Geschmeidig rund, dann kräftige Säure. Zuerst verwechselt mit starkem Alkoholgeschmack, dann aber klare Fruchtsäure. Lecker obst-fruchtig mit leichten Bitternoten. Im Abgang weiterhin bitter, aber dezente malzartige Süße verbleibt auf der Zunge. 

Sehr interessante und vielseitige Mischung."

3.0,"Rich and full flavoured. This is one of the fruitiest whiskeys I have tried and it packs a bit too much sweetness for my tastes. It is a very nice step up from your standard Irish fare, but at the price point is likely not a repeat purchase."

4.0,"Visual:  Medium amber/gold color. Thin to medium legs that take a little while to slide into the glass.

Nose:  Candied Almonds, hazelnuts, and pecans are first to arrive, followed by honey and cereal, a la Honey Nut Cheerios. Citrus zest and apple juice follow. Thankfully, the initial objectionable sourness that I found in the 12-year-old was not present at all here.
Palate: Sweet and nutty like the nose, with some grain and a little spice. I get a little of the savory note that I found in the 12, especially when breathing out through my nose. Nice sweetness, but not over the top. 

Finish:  I agree with those who experienced a dry, oaky finish. The dryness and slight bitterness are not off-putting. The finish is medium length and warming, but not too hot.

Empty glass: Lightly nutty.

Overall, I like this much better than its 12-year old younger sibling. I especially like the nose better, but the entire experience is much better than the 12. I believe the 14-year benefits from being bottled at 46% ABV instead of 40%.  I would buy a bottle of this for sure. Four stars."
5.0,There aren't many true irishes I wouldn't give four stars to. They're made from the same malt and taste similarly good. This (for me at least) is a step above it's emerald isle brethren.
