2.25,"Nose - Light apple notes, oaky simple syrup, light hint of ethanol

Taste - Much sweeter on the initial palate than the nose would suggest, caramel apple candies, sharp sweetness, almost splenda-like, apple jolly ranchers, slightly bitter like apple seeds/stems

Finish - Light tingle, lingering sweetness, similar to sugar-free apple candies, simple syrup

Score - 69/100

Final Thoughts - This one had a farily boring nose, not much there, faint hints of apple mixed in with the typical nose I get from younger triple distilled grain whiskies (like basic Jameson). On the palate it was much more flavor intensive with a good creamy mouthfeel, but quite sweet. Sadly this sweetness was a very artificial sweetener-like sweetness with quite a bit of bitterness that was a little distracting. I think this might be delegated to making cocktails where it shares the role with either an apple brandy or other Calvados as it's not that great neat.
