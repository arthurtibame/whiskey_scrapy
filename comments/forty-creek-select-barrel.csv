4.0,"Sweet corn and rye sting hit first on the nose, then a fruity caramel. Sherry notes and a hint of orange peel as well. On the first taste a wash of pepper, rye spice, and sherry-influenced fruit. Quite surprisingly soft on the palate, a bourbony initial presence that barely registers alcohol. It's practically mellifluent. After sitting on the tongue the rye spice comes out more powerfully."

5.0,"I find this to be a well balanced whiskey, very easy to drink. Great for most occasions, it's my ""go to"".  One of the best Canadian whiskeys for the price. I find others to be a little on the sweet side. Recommended if you enjoy a smokey taste with a side of vanilla and almond."

4.0,"This is my go to Canadian whisky.  Reasonable price point.  An excellent cocktail whisky, but equally fine to sip neat or with ice. This whisky redefined Canadian whisky.  The special release whiskies provide better range in taste profiles. If you have tasted the Barrel Select, do try and find  a special release. The Port Wood Reserve from 2012 was very good. If you like a more rye forward style, try the Copper Pot Reserve."

5.0,"This is the whisky that got me back into drinking whisky. 

Why? The warm, spices —cinnamon and ginger— when combined with the sweeter notes of caramel and caramelization create a product that is very welcoming for sipping neat.

It doesn't have a lot of oak or vanilla flavours, which allows more ingredients to have their say. Too many products have become too dependent on oak and vanilla. This is not one of them."
2.0,"Aromas of vanilla, caramel, maple syrup, slight ginger, and candle wax. Unfortunately, there is also a bit of a chemical note, almost like a blend of bleach and soap. No spice or alcohol, which comes off as a bit dull.
    Tastes of vanilla, caramel, maple with a slight creamy feel. 
      
      Nothing notable but an alternative to cheap bourbon. Decent mixed with maple syrup, bitters, and a cinnamon stick, and on the rocks for a nice wintery cocktail without breaking the bank. Would only drink if mixed."

3.0,"First off, this is a great Canadian whiskey, an excellent variety of grains offers a bold character but maintains overall smoothness expected from a ""canadian"".

3.0,"Review transfer from Barreled from February 2016. 

My favorite Canadian whisky. Dark copper in color.  Intense butterscotch and toffee on the nose with hints of rye and brown sugar.  Sweet with a subtle rye spice on the palate. More of the butterscotch coming through in the development and finish. It's like a small batch craft version of Canadian Club with a price that is very easy on the wallet (I paid $32 for a 1L bottle).   On a recommendation from a well respected whisky reviewer, I added a few drops of a peated Islay malt (Laphroaig). As expected, it added a nice smokey component without taking away its identity.

2017 Update: it's a little harsher than I remember but still good. Found it pairs well with a splash (maybe 15%) of Dr. Pepper. It was a 4 upon first review but now I would say 3.5-3.75"

1.0,"Here goes another “Christmas of 2017 50ml Plastic Bottle Stocking Stuffer.” Rolls off the tongue.

Unfortunately this whisky does not. It coats the tongue like a shrunken turtleneck of undesirable flavor. 

The nose smells like something you’d cook with, but not want to taste alone. Corn starch. Possibly a scented bath wash. Only whisky scent I get here would be sugar, but a syrupy version. Like pure simple syrup.

Body is what the nose suggests. I genuinely feel like I’m previewing a step in making whisky, not the finished product. So thick, so buttery, so syrupy sweet. It’s terrible. I’ve genuinely had better white dog.

Finish carries off a melted butter flavor. 

This is so bad. Why is the average rating so high? Not speaking rhetorically here, I really want someone to educate me. I don’t know a ton about Canadian Whisky, so I may just be ignorantly dumping on the holy beaver of whiskies right now. Best in show. You do you, Canada. Not for this guy."

Palate: Brown sugar, some nuttiness (chestnut), sweet tea, sweet rye grain, an apricot and peach medley, plenty of fresh grain, subtle toffee, some dark cocoa in the background, a ripe plum note, oak sweet bless and wood sugar with corn graininess, a hint of candied lemon peel
