4.0,Solid malt. Very similar taste profile as other speyside classics like balvenie and macallan. Worthy for any collection.

4.0,"I don’t have much experience with Benromach.  I believe I’ve had the 10 and maybe 1-2 of the vintage Peat Smoke offerings, but that’s it.  I wouldn’t say I avoid this distillery, as everything I’ve tried has been solid to very good, I just don’t seek this one out.  No real reason why, I just don’t.  However, my friend @Telex (from MD) graciously sent a bunch of us a pour of this one: known in the US as Benromach Imperial Proof (not to be mistaken with the 100 Proof bottling- both are the same whisky and are just labeled differently depending on market).  Imperial proof is 57% by U.K. standards.

So, this one is 57% ABV and is a muddy copper in color and oily, with sparse legs and very tiny droplets left behind after a spin in the taster.  The nose has lots of spicy aromas:  black pepper, wood spice, even a little Christmas spice mingles about in there.  The backbone here is provided by a fresh, leathery note and some light orchard fruit.  Crisp apples and pears imply a subtle sweetness awaiting you on the tongue.

The palate really kicks things into gear with the woody notes washing across the tongue.  Orchard fruits keep the heat at bay, initially- but when it arrives it really takes command and pushes the soft stuff away.  The nose doesn’t prepare you for the onslaught of heat that comes by the middle of the sip.  There’s a real fire here that can’t be denied, although it is surprisingly smooth for not only the age, but the higher strength.  You really need to enjoy a wood-soaked style of whisky here to be thoroughly entertained IMHO.

The finish is long, steadily warming and once again, woody.  I can’t get over how butter smooth the liquid is, though.  I would’ve guessed this was a much older dram that was left lingering in virgin oak had I not known what I was getting into.  This one seems like it would play well for a barrel strength, wheated bourbon drinker.

In the end, it acts older than it is and that should be its claim to fame.  It’s not complex and it just does what it does quite well.  I’m not exactly sure of the price point, but if it was a $50-60 bottle I’d say it’s a great deal.  I have a feeling it’s more expensive, since it’s single malt, and that’s where I’d have to hold it more accountable for its shortcomings, like lack of depth and complexity.  Not knowing price- it’s a 4 star dram.  Maybe I need to look into more Benromach offerings- especially for those times I want to feel like I’m drinking a well-crafted bourbon instead of a scotch whisky.  Cheers, my friends."
4.25,"I first experienced Benromach through the 10 year and found it to be a well crafted, flavorful dram.  The Peat Smoke was good but not equal to the 10.  Now the Imperial was provided through a generous pour by @Telex.  This is one I have not seen in my region and appreciate the opportunity to finally taste. 

Some research details that this was cashed 80% ex-Bourbon, 20% ex-Sherry & 12 month Oloroso cask finish. All served at 117 proof. 

The color is a yellowish brown. 

There is a faint leather opening and mustiness that greets the nose. This pattern holds for a fair length. And then the sweetness arrives. Butterscotch, apple crumb pie with cinnamon and caramel drizzle.  Buttered whole wheat toast and roasted, glazed walnuts.  A full and busy nose, but it’s not disjointed. 

The body is thick and velvety and slides in indiscreetly and then explodes with a potpourri of flavors: spice, sweet, mineral or earthiness and wood.  Brown sugar, caramel, cream soda, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, oak, oak char, toasted coconut, oranges and apples. 

A touch of water brightens  the nose and the caramel and sugar comes forward. The sweetness on the palate is also amplified and the spiciness squelched.  However, the weightiness and thickness of the body is diminished.

An oaky dryness coupled with traces of caramel and brown sugar provide a long finish.  Oak char, tobacco and mint are detectable and all flavors ride out to a deep, warm finish. 

This really needs time, lots of time, to lure the aromas and flavors.  The high proof provides some weight and beefiness to the malt. It’s sweet enough to enjoy after a meal and may pair well with a cigar given the spice and sweet.  The addition of water provides a sweeter dram and provides and opportunity to enjoy this in two variations, depending on your mood.  A beefed-up 10 Year. Quite well crafted; quite tasty; quite good.

4.75,"NOSE: cocoa powder, biscuits, raspberries and barbecue
PALATE: toffee, chocolate, cinnamon, red berries, barley, with a touch of peat to round it off
FINISH: even more chocolate
Delicious and clearly a product of a distillery doing it old-school"
4.25,"Nose starts off with a slight smokiness, then butterscotch, brine, vanilla cream, and a bit of lemon. Palate has a oak spiciness, lemon, butterscotch, dark fruits, and malt to end. Finish is sweet, salty, and smoky. There are some sherry notes as well."
4.0,"Wonderful dram through and through. My first introduction to Benromach, but it certainly wasn’t my last."

4.0,"Nez puissant et très caramélisé, avec toutefois une pointe de fumé.
Attaque franche et raide qui laisse place à un whisky puissant et torride, dans une belle alliance de vanille, de caramel et de fumé. On sent bien le 100° Proof mais sans que cela n'agresse trop.
La finale est très longue et très agréable sans être trop puissante.
Au final, un excellent whisky mais très puissant, dans pas à la portée de tout le monde ou de toutes les occasions."

5.0,"With Ziad in London 2018. Bought, gave to Othmane."
4.0,"The nose opened with large round notes of butterscotch, brown sugar, smoky oak, sweet malt and tropical fruit (pineapple).  These aromas are followed by the scent of old books (musty), lemon furniture polish, buttered biscuits, warm vanilla custard and dates.  The influence of the ex-bourbon barrels is strong.  Salty butterscotch is the first flavor note to hit the palate along with sweet malt, pineapple, mint, spicy oak and creamy vanilla.  At 57% ABV there is some alcohol burn, but it fades quickly.  The finish is long and warm, filled with spicy oak, mint, vanilla, charred smoke and just a hint of peat.  Adding water brings out a lot more peat and sweet malt, and also reveals some ripe red fruit that was not present at full strength.  Much of the bourbon influence (butterscotch, brown sugar, spicy oak and vanilla) has been pushed to the background.  The character of the whisky has shifted considerably, but it remains full, rich and lush.  With or without water the Benromach 10 year Imperial Proof is an excellent whisky.  4 out of 5 stars.  Highly recommended!"
