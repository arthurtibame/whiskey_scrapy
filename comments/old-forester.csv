2.0,"It was far to strong (in my opinion) and needed to be cut with water before it was drinkable on its own.
I was recommended this for making old fashioned's and it turned out good but I had to add extra simple syrup."

3.0,"a lighter more fruity and floral bourbon. smooth with a punch, but lack the warmth found in my favorite bourbons. nose is honey, vanilla, oak. bitter alcohol taste fades quickly to notes of honey and other pleasant flavors associated with bourbon. tangy orange finish rather than burning warm. cant say i like this bourbon. taste is refined but i find it inferior to other common bourbons. Evan Williams, Jim Beam, Old Grand-Dad, and Wild Turkey 101 are all better spirits for the price"

4.0,"The nose is oak, with a spicy black pepper char. There is Skybar vanilla creme, with a second wave of syrupy toffee. The diesel burn hits the nasal cavity before quickly dissipating. That barrel char is wonderful. It's also got a nice set of stems dripping down the inside of the glass.

The first taste is ribbon candy sugar, quickly swallowed up by the oak char. After the char, there is a little tannic plum, morphing into a metallic flavor.

There is a little heat on the tip of the tongue, but it mellows into a mild cigar/pipe-like bite. 

The finish is tobacco ash, with some spicy orange zest in the fade-out. The finish is long and really sets up shot on the palate. It's got a dry, ashy finish."

2.0,"Old Forster Classic 86 is a Kentucky Straight Bourbon known to be the first bottled bourbon. It is comprised of a mashbill of 72% corn, 18% rye, and 10% malted barley. There are a lot of classic bourbon notes, without much complexity and rather dull. It is bottled at 86 proof/43%ABV. 

Color: Dark Brown Copper

Nose: Brown sugar, strawberry, oak, honey, floral, bubblegum, and antique wood.

Palate: Cinnamon spice, rye spice, oak, tobacco, and leather.

Finish: Short, leather, and cinnamon spice."
3.5,"Easy drinking, banana nose, caramel"
3.5,Had some on big ice. Sweet finish like cherry I thought. Not bad at all for $25 out the door in west Michigan.

3.5,"Nose = buttery, vanilla, oaky. 
Palate = smooth, light spice on the end, cherry. 

A pleasant experience - smooth and not overpowering."
2.5,"First thing that comes to mind is cherry cough syrup.  Not bad, but obviously not a favorite."
