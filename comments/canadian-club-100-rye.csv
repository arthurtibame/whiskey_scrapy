3.25,"Sipping neat, I was unsure after the first sip or two but found it pleasantly grew on me. Nose a bit heavy on the ethanol, but overall a respectable balance and I enjoyed the mouthfeel."

4.0,"I bought a bottle of this Canadian Rye on a business trip recently and what a wonderful surprise it was. I like the regular Canadian Club but it is thin as far as taste is concerned but this Rye is really nice for the price. It is smooth and spicey with just enough heat to remind you that you are drinking a spirit. With ice or a bit of water the vanilla comes out and it is a nice after-dinner drink. Also, it makes a very tasty Manhattan. Overall I still like Bulliet Rye better but you really can't go wrong with this Rye."
4.25,"Canadian Club is a very solid rye. It pours a very dark amber in the glass (caramel No40?). The nose is plenty of rye spice and vanilla/oak. It is true to these in the mouth and is very smooth. It doesn't have any strong swings one way or the other, so it works very well in any and all standard rye based cocktails. My son-in-law loves rye Manhattans and I often gift him a bottle of rye or strong rye bourbon. He seems to be the happiest with this Canadian Club 100% rye, no matter what price I have paid for the others. By the way, this can be found in the KC region for $14-$20. This would be a fantastic rye as the ""house rye"" for an upscale bar. It may not be your favorite rye style, but it should offend no one. I really prefer the a rye in the 60-95% range, but this is really good, very affordable, and is always in my home."

2.0,"Promising spicy and woody nose leads to a pleasant arrival that quickly falls flat, leaving you wanting more but it's not there. The finish is long and warming, but not enough to compensate. Flat in a Manhattan as well. I go to rye for big, bold and spicy, so this is far too subtle for my taste."
3.0,"Another Barreled transfer from December 2016


This review is coming from across the border in Windsor from my brother in laws liquor cabinet. 

This blended Canadian whisky is 100% rye, comes in at the minimum 40% ABV, appears to be a heavily colored dark amber and is most likely chill filtered. 

The nose is quite interesting. It smells heavily of breaded and baked whitefish. To clarify, it doesn't smell fishy, you can have fish that isn't fishy. Nice rye bread aromas as well. It's not very complex but it is very warm and inviting. 

Unlike the standard Canadian Club, the palate is very smooth and easy to drink. A bit of rye spice but nothing even close to too much. Again, not overly complex. Given my lack of rye experience I can't really pick out much more in the palate. It does have a sweetness to it. 

It does have a bit of spice on the finish which is medium short. 

Not bad for a cheap every day sipping rye or for mixing."

3.75,"Full rye flavor with a softer, less spicy palate."
4.0,"Canadian Club Green delivers a great whisky for a very reasonable price.  Nose has hints of spice, cinnamon, fruit, rye, sweetness.  Dry, spicy finish.  This was tested blind against Basil Hayden and JP Wiser 2018 and was the clear winner.  Usually drink CC Green with ice and I didn’t recognize it.  This is a go to for an everyday easy drinking whisky.  Extra stars for value."

3.75,"I’ve never seen a 100% rye, so I just had to grab this. While this is Canadian Club, blended, and likely not that old, $18 for a 750 seemed reasonable, and could help me explore the flavors of rye more. 

Look: Canadian Club 100% rye is a nice amber colored, with golden yellow on the edges, showing in the light. 

Nose: I get a lot of ethanol, some slight wheat note, mild spice, little bit of oak. Not much to speak of, but this is also a 40% alcohol. Disappointing to say the least. 

Palate: The flavor is much better. Big time rye bread, some slight oaky notes, almost maple. The rye bread is really what sticks out. Not a lot of cinnamon or pepper until you let the rye sit on your tongue. 

Finish: The finish is nice and sweet, the rye bread again is what I get, not really a vanilla or brown sugar I’d get from a bourbon. Some slight bitterness in the finish, but pretty mild in length. 

Overall: For 18 dollars, this is pretty good. I’d say upping the proof would be helpful, but I’m not sure that’s a realistic proposal for a CC product. If you’ve ever wondered what flavors and aroma rye gives off in a bourbon or mixed grain spirit, take a look at Canadian Club 100% rye."

3.0,"I think I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, because the first night I had 7 shots, the next night I drank 5!  Virtually no sweetness at all, this has a grain/cereal core with a lot of spice, but it is smooth as glass!  It's nice to taste a pure rye to learn it's flavors so you can pick it out in a bourbon.  I will keep this around as a change of pace sipper."

4.0,"Two things right off the top: 1. I never thought I would be giving a Canadian Club product a better review than ""I had this at a wedding reception because it was the only option, and I didn't die so we're calling it a win,"" and 2. The four stars is reflective of the versatility of this whisky...it's more of a 3 .5 or so for flavor, but read on and see why I'm rounding up. After seeing Distiller's high rating, and since their ""Affordable Canadian"" list came out right as I was thinking I should do a little boozy exploration of the Great White North, I figured it was worth a spin. For $20, you're hard-pressed to find a better rye whisky for low-key, casual sipping with some friends, or (best yet) making cocktails. The nose is sweet, with clove and freshly chopped dill; meanwhile, the palate somehow manages to be smooth, dill pickle-y, a bit spicy, and a bit sweet all at once without becoming a busy-seeming trainwreck. That's not a half bad balancing act. It's a little too smooth and easy for my personal rye preferences insofar as drinking neat goes, but I can already imagine how good this will be in my go-to summer cocktails - Manhattans, Old Fashioneds, and Sazeracs especially. I'd even venture a guess that a (sacrilege alert) mint julep would be pretty decent with this as the whisky base."
