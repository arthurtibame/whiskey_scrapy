3.0,"Just had a third dram, this time generous with the water, 1 part to 5 parts Arran.  Really opened up nicely. 
Bourbon notes over power the nose. Salted apricots come to mind. Finish is fresh and light."

4.5,"This is the review for the 55%abv expression, which i have to say is one of the most tropical whiskies i have ever had. 

On the nose, Starfruits, heathery peat, citric notes like fresh oranges and cigarrettes. 

On the palate, it is very smooth for 55%abv.
Oranges, apricots, mango, tropical fruits. Pineapple, a very mild spiciness. A slight vanilla note. Nice.

Aftertaste has a very soft peatiness, some liquorice and herbal spiciness. Very pleasant. 

Overall i believe this to be a very nice dram, so enjoyable. 91 over 100 is a proper score for it."

3.0,"Dried wine skins, oak and hint of orchard fruit on the nose, followed by some cooked pears, honey and clove on the palate. There is a bit of a burn on the finish, but otherwise ends on a dry and peppery note. Not bad, but not the most enjoyable whisky for me."

3.0,"I did not dislike this whisky, and at 50% ABV, I strongly suggest adding some water to improve its overall flavour. The nose has hints of oranges and almonds, with prodigious notes of caramel. The finish is smooth provided you've added water, and the overall experince is a good one."

4.25,"Surprise of the night, very unique flavor profile. Its sweet but it has a very drying finish. Completely different from the 10 and 14 year old but very pleasant. The finish is long probably due to the 50% ABV. Fruity and spicy. Great!"

4.25,"Quick first impression.
Red wine sourness punches through as soon as you open the bottle on nose.  Sweet fruity opening.  Will have to add more when I can sit down inside away from grill smoke  with a dram.  Will save rating until then.  

Updated to 4.25star. Surprisingly like this even though I don’t care much for red wine or the sour note I get at first.  It blends in well with other flavors though.  Fruity and sour on nose and taste follows suit but adds in a smoke and bit of bite with good finish."

4.0,"The nose, to say the least, is complicated, and FRUSTRATING!!!! It has a fruit punch quality, with strawberries, and other red fruits. But there is something else, that reminds me of, strangely enough, basil!?! The tongue is sweet, buttery, and very nice. The finish is short and sweet, and easy"

3.75,"The nose is interesting. Strawberry, berry liquor.. it's one of those times I really get annoyed I can't put a finger on what I'm tasting or smelling.  There is something else it reminds me of. Stronger on the ethanol but a few drops of water calm it down.  The finish is strong enough to almost balance it out. It's not crafted nearly as well as the Balblair I had last night. I think I'd compare it to the Tyrconnell 10 sherry. Loads of flavour but rougher round the edges; if you'd had a few drams you'd definitely rate it higher than if it's first up as your tongue needs to be numb to the ethanolly nature. I'm not a nose man but I prefer the nose to the palate in this case. If I could vapourise and inhale this one I would. Red current gummies someone noted which matched what I smelt or sweet fruit compote (wohoo I had an original thought). It's almost like someone crossed mild chilli peppers and strawberries. Anyway off my meandering soapbox and on to rating. Nose 4.5. Taste 3.5...rating 3.75 it is.  A rare dram where the quality of the nose pulls the palate off the floor, dusts it up and makes the combined package more than average. Afterthought: I went away did drunk dad trampoling with the kids and tried it again. Taste improved a fair bit..psychology, air, my tongue numbing to the ethanolliness or the chimay and garage project dessert lager all started kicking in..or something else but I've adjusted my taste rating up to 3.5. Overall rating stays the same."

3.5,"Fine fruity and earthy nose. Good palate but only for a second until a very dry taste sets in before the otherwise nice woody, cigar box finish.

22-22-22-21=87"
4.0,"Nose: Fragrant but dusky, with a lifted oak note enlivened by cinnamon and floral grape notes. There is a drying, woody and almost salty aroma like cured planks. It reminds me of wooden church pews on a warm Sunday morning. Pears, green apples and fresh-mown grass. 

Palate: A quite perfectly smooth sweet and dry arrival with plum and cinnamon notes. Richer fruits emerge as it develops, taking the palate on a journey from dry to sweet and back again. Dark cherries, almond paste, walnut loaf, Turkish coffee, dark 90% chocolate, dried apricots, plums and a malty sweetness. An amazing texture that is full and sweet whist being simultaneously dry and almost astringent. There are some cunning tannic elements at work that are magical in their effect.

Finish: Medium. The sweet character turns dry temporarily, but relaxes to leave a sweet dark fruity aftertaste. 

A dry, earthy and complex whisky. It's quite remarkable, but of the three Arran cask-finishes I've just tasted (sauternes, port and amarone) this is the most difficult to engage, and was the one that I thought really improved with a little water. Dilution instantly relaxes this whisky, balances the astringent tannic notes that appear right through the profile, and a sweet grape note appears on the palate.

While a purist might argue that this is actually not a positive thing, I felt that the whisky blossomed and came into its own, as if it was almost relieved to be under less stress. It's probably the least approachable of the three cask finishes, but all deserve a solid 4 stars (however the sauternes cask finish is my favourite). (tasted from a 30ml sample).

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"
3.75,"Bright red fruits, baking spices, vanilla, cedar, slightly too hot for my liking."
