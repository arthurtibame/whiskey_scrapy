4.5,"What did you do in 1973? Watergate, oil crisis and the first cell phone call - four decades of history in a glass. Samaroli bottled this 40-year-old Glen Grant from sherry cask #6588 (180 bottles, 45% ABV). The nose is a true delight: fragrant notes of mocha, fermented fruits and old furniture intermingle with hints of cinnamon, laurels and polished wood. On the palate, complex spices, walnuts and juicy berries take over, and the oak influence is just perfect. Dark chocolate, oranges and caramel remain in the restrained but elegant finish. An adorable Single Malt!
