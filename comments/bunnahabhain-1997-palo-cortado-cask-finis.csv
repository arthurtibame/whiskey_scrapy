Final Thoughts - This one has a very unique nose for sure and definitely isn't like any other sherry finished Bunnahabhains I've have in the past. This isn't your typical stone fruit sweet, but more of a lightly medicinal/metallic smoky/tangy sweet. It's very unique and is surprisingly very well balanced. I think the fact that I get a few dried persimmon notes in this (I'm not a huge fan of persimmons) throws this off a bit for me.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No
