3.0,"Taste the alcohol but nice spice and chocolate flavor. Smelling it is like whiffing turpentine. Who needs a nose hair trimmer when you can singe them away with this thing. They like it hot in Waco bro.

Note : check out their single malt and bourbon"

4.0,Tasty notes of spice and vanilla.
3.75,"The nose contains dust, faint rye spice, and a little bit of barrel, but is not particularly interesting or distinct. The taste kicks off with intense dark chocolate unfolding into something like a charred burger Patty. Which sounds gross, but is really engaging."
