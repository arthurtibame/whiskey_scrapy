3.0,"Before I bought it, I had read many promising opinions. Initially it taste very sweet (too sweet?). I was little bit disappointed but finally my note is acceptable mainly taking into consideration the price. I prefer Highland Park 10Y and Connemara over Finlaggan but it may change. Definitely worth trying for reasonably price."
