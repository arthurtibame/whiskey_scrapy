4.75,"I must confess: I had my doubts. Could this 200th-anniversary edition of Lagavulin 25 fulfill the high expectations? With natural cask strength of 51.7% ABV (bottle no. 1573), the nose achieves perfect balance between delicate peatiness and intense but not too dominating sherry cask influence. Cigar smoke, orange peel and dried fruits harmonize with notes of strong tea, cinnamon and dark chocolate. The taste is impressively zesty, rich and peaty dry, leading to a prolonged and bitter spicy finish. A truly superb Islay whisky with a hefty price tag.

5.0,"Live dispatch from Feis Ile 2018.  My wife and I tried this as part of the manager’s masterclass on the first day of Feis Ile, which belongs to Lagavulin.  This is a dark scotch, similar in color to the Distillers Edition despite the lack of added color.  Chocolate, caramel, and oil on the nose are a fitting preview for a rich, fruit-filled palate.   There’s an eerie lack of heat.  The finish is delicious, mellowed peat and barbecue smoke.

Finally, I have to say, as good as this scotch is, the Feis experience at Lagavulin may be better, and it’s incredibly generous at that.  Free drams of Lagavulin 16, 8, and Distillers Edition, free cocktails, free shirts for attendees, live music, and a gorgeous setting on the southern coast of Islay.  It’s a thank you to the fans, not just another way to monetize our love for the product.  You could literally go to Feis Ile Lagavulin day, not spend a dime, and take it all in.  We of course bought various tastings and two Feis bottles, so did not quite make it out for free ;)"

null,"Nothing consumable on God’s earth is worth this kind of money, yet here I am to tell you that 1220/8000 is mine. My love of Lagavulin and optics alone were enough for me to buy this. After doing a little research, I noticed the 25yo, 2002 edition has almost doubled in market value at auction since this introduction. Given the historical significance of the 200th anniversary releases, I’m sure this investment will continue to hold its value as long as I can resist the temptation to drink it. It would take a very special occasion for me to crack this baby open, so for now I’ll justify my stupidity as a fine arts purchase, and hope my wife doesn’t find the receipt. :)"

5.0,There's a toasted caramel flavor to this. Exquisite!
5.0,"Nose: dried fruits, very sweet, very little to no peat smell. Honey and green apple maybe?
  Taste: great dried fruit, oily, sticky and thick, even at cask strength its very smooth, very little pepper and smoke, little salty overall (dried) fruity taste.
  Aftertaste: medium long.. Lovely~~ 93/100 now go back to my Lagavulin 16"
