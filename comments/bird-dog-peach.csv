null,"Not very good, Bird dog alone isn't all that but putting peach flavored syrup in it is not a way to improve it.  Simply another bad idea in the current craze of ""flavoring"" whiskey."

2.0,"Too sweet with artificial fruit flavor. Could blend into a mixer but there are better options. Not for drinking on it's own, but to be fair I don't care for peach flavoring."

3.5,"Decent Stuff 
Mixes well with Iced Tea 🍵"
4.75,"I first want to thank Tango and WhiskeyFunatic for reviewing and recommending this ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL flavored whiskey. Tango is spot on with his description of the whiskey and even his great explanation falls short of this great product. When I opened the bottle it smelled like real peach juice and when poured into a rocks glass the scent of soft whiskey and peaches could be smelled around the glass. Bird Dog has a better flavor and a deeper flavor that Jim Beam Peach. My dad had a bottle of Jim Beam Peach Bourbon on hand and we tried it side by side with Bird Dog and it was no comparison the Bird Dog tasted like real peach juice and the JB was like artificial flavoring. Over ice, it is even better and with the holidays fast approaching try this over soft vanilla ice cream it tastes amazing. Now I know there are some people that will not want to try this because of the flavor but it is an outstanding addition to any bar especially with the holidays and the colder weather coming our way. Enjoy."

1.5,"Harsh dry nose, filled w/ peach flavoring scent, scant hints of oak, moderate burn covered by syrupy peach flavoring, moderate syrupy mouth feel, minor oak hints w/ a mild burn & peach finish.
     Tasted neat in a rocks glass."
