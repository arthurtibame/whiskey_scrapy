4.0,Wow. It's got that heat and spice goin on.  Definitely worth the price. Visit the distillery in Detroit if you can.
5.0,The best I've had in my limited experience  (I'm 45 but just finding my tastes for whiskey over wine). I can't justify the price however I have no doubt it is worth it.
5.0,"Very nice golden body, strong first few sips, nice spice and tint of sweetness."

3.0,"The flagship of Detroit's Two James Distillery--a place that's totally worth checking out if you're ever in Detroit. What you've got here is high-rye LDI bourbon finished in madiera wine casks (a holdover until their own spirit comes of age; they've already got some young experiments on the market). What I like here is that it's not *just* another sourced whiskey; they're at least doing something a bit different with the red wine finish. Nose is recognizably LDI (think TinCup), but there's some nice winey nuttiness here; a bit of plum, fruit, syrup. Candied nuts? Baking spice and mulled wine. Some spirity ethanol. A bit thin in the mouth; first taste is a bit green, with that LDI nuttiness (similar to, but distinct from, Beam yeast nuttiness), but then there's that vinous sweetness, some red fruits, and solid rye spice. Finish is a bit chewy, with some fresh oak, dryness. The price on this one is high ($59.99 at the distillery), and the spirit feels a bit young--but the fundamentals are sound, and this is one I'm prepared to endorse (however tentatively) for the sake of supporting a really good local distillery in one of my favourite cities in the world. The 10-year reserve or the Cask Strength limited edition are certainly also worth investigating, though the price on them is . . . prohibitive."

3.0,Not much on the nose but this is an open air place with a breeze going through. Good rye bite and a pleasant burn. Enjoy it but the price point is steep.

2.0,Nice flavor up front but finishes like water.  Sort of like Jim Beam White that's been finished in a madeira cask.  At $50 U.S. / bottle save your money and buy 2 bottles of Buffalo Trace.

4.25,"Vanilla, sweet, smooth.  A great one to sip neat.  A little heat on the backend but just enough."
5.0,I love the Madeira sweetness to it.
2.0,"It tastes and smells like an extremely young rye, both nose and palate are nothing but grass.  I will revisit this bottle in a couple of weeks."
4.0,Really smooth.  Not a lot of kick.  Good one to sip and enjoy.  93 proof.
3.75,$60 but very good.  Sweet with just a bit of heat
