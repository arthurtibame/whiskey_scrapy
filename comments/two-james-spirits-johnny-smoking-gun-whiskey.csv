3.0,"This sample was sent to me by @Generously_Paul, who is a Detroit native.  I'd never have been able to source this one on my own.  It is advertised as a rye-based whiskey that should work well with savory Japanese pork or possibly even sushi.

I tried a small pour neat and then finished the remaining sample with a delicious and spicy tempura crab roll.  It really did work well with the food, as the whiskey has a weird flavor profile that is hard to describe.  There's definitely a bit of saltiness and spiciness that makes it seem a lot better with food.  As far as neat, I think it reminds me of a flavored, young moonshine with a bit of peppered spice mixed in.  

Thanks to Paul for sending me this and I'm glad I finished the sample with sushi.  It may also work well with smoked Gouda cheese and some charcuterie.  All in all, it's pretty interesting and definitely different.  Cheers."
3.0,"Review from 6/2016 from Barreled 

First whiskey I've had from Detroit, produced  about 20 minutes from where I live so I had to give it a try. 43.5% ABV, appears to be natural color but cannot be sure. This bottle is from batch 7. And speaking of bottle, this is the strangest shape I've seen for a whiskey bottle. On the label it states ""An American whiskey crafted specifically to compliment the umami of the rich pork and fish broths of Japanese cuisine"". On first nosing I immediately agreed. The nose is influenced by the 30% rye in the mash bill, but has a salty, slightly smokey fish tone (think smoked herring). I also get some fruity notes like mango or dried pineapple. Very unique. Nice oily mouth feel. The rye dominates the palate and the finish is long and lingering.  I could absolutely pair this with a smoked fish or sushi or pork dish. 3.5"
2.0,"A really compelling idea, but the execution just isn't there: an American whiskey designed specifically to be paired with Asian foods. What that means in practice is a blend of whiskeys--corn-heavy--with the addition of some teas. And if you order it at Johnny Noodle King (the restaurant in Detroit that it was originally created for), it's paired with a shotglass of ramen broth (which is a delightful touch). But the flavour is a bit all over the place: corny, young, sweet, smoky, tobacco. Some flavours of star anise and licorice: boozy and hot, even over time, with some off . . . like . . . glue or plastic character."

2.0,"Locally craft whiskey/beer/food, I find interesting, as one is often is proud to share the regional culture.  Thanks to Generously Paul, I got to taste a sample of a Michigan bourbon.
 
It noses of vanilla extract and was initially all I could sense.  Given more time, nutmeg with the vanilla extract gave me a comparable aroma you get at Thanksgiving dessert: mainly pumpkin pie with whipped cream.
 
A vanilla sweetness over a thin lightweight body along with the nutmeg spice; the nose carries over onto to the palate.  A youngness of the spirit can be detected and reveals a quick distillation process.
 
The palate is left with some vanilla and oak flavors that turn slightly bitter.
 
A short and simple bourbon that is down and dirty.  Probably works best for shots or as a mixer.

4.0,"Generously Paul provided a sample of this as part of a bonus offering in our little Scottish distillery sampling team.  This is one of those that either you'll like or dislike.  Note I didn't say love or hate---I don't think it initiates the love /hate like a Laphroaig, but a notch or two lower in emotion.  Almost like a lighter version of Balcones; campfire smoky but more floral vanilla mixed in.  Strangely, I didn't like it on its own, but instead was really good with sushi.  For some reason, there was this symbiotic relationship between the two.  Thanks to Paul for providing this Michigan local!"

2.0,"Wow. Smokey no kidding. This tastes like if you stood next to a campfire, made your shirt wet, and wrung it out. Admittedly I was allured by the bottle and their community and craft movement involvement, but this is not a daily driver. I imagine this would be a good pair with a meaty meal like they suggest, but otherwise, wow it's smokey."

5.0,"Originally created for a ramen noodle shop in Detroit, a place called Johnny Noddle King. When Johnny Noodle King received their liquor license they wanted one whiskey to compliment their cuisine. When tasting this whiskey, picture yourself eating the wonderful rich umami flavour of ramen. 

To create this one of a kind whiskey Two James macerates a blend of Asian teas into the 70% corn whiskey and 30% white rye blend. 

Perfect for any cocktail that calls for lemon. Black tea pairs remarkably well with lemon so it works wonders in whiskey lemonades, sours and hot toddy's."
