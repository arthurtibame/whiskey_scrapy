Final Thoughts - This falls right in line with what I've had from Amrut. It has this nice tropical fruity influence while at the same time preserving the toasted/malted barley influence. Not sure if they use rum casks or something, but I get a lot of sugar cane influence in this one along with grilled pineapple throughout. I have a feeling this would be absolutely amazing with a bit of coconut water or something for a nice tropical long drink.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - No"
5.0,"Taste 3 at the Wheated event. $10/pour at discount. Great stuff with tropical pineapple, citrus, and tangy notes with rich malty cereal and a little chocolate."
