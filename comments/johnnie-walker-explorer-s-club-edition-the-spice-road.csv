3.0,It's a flavorful whiskey that has a light but stinging after taste. It's not smooth but the aroma is pleasing and something to linger over. As strange as it sounds a slice of lemon does a lot to increase the appeal of this whiskey.

3.0,"Cinnamon, clove, and very smooth. It's a wonderful blend but it reminds me of spiced rum and therefore stops me from calling it good scotch. Also I don't think it's worth the price, but would absolutely stock up if it were $30/bottle"

3.0,"Big nothing for me. If Black Label is the baseline, then this isn't different enough nor is it close enough. It's an airport present that you ain't gonna try, but it may impress the recipient."
4.0,"Honey , cinnamon, spice. Very drinkable."
3.0,"Some fun spice in this bottle - has a more rounded taste than stndard Walker, with nutmeg and other notes present. The best of the traveler series."

4.0,As a beginner this whisky has been the first that isn't too overpowering for me to drink neat. I find it goes down very smoothly and doesn't leave an unwarranted alcohol burn in my throat.

3.0,I found this duty free in Istanbul.  It was very smooth and the exotic spices were definitely evident.  Kind of like their black label except sweeter.

2.5,"Neat in a Sutherland tasting glass at Thanksgiving at Uncle Michael Hoo-ha's in Freehold, NJ.  Nose is odd, with some soap and spice notes. Taste is more spicy, with some smoke peaking through. Nah.  12/28/19."
