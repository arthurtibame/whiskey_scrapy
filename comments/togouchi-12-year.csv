3.0,"A spicier and drier, more austere offering than the Kiwami/ Premium version (Kiwami and Premium being pretty much identical), the aging pushes forth the bitter sherry and the fruity fine cask, regrettably, the delicate balance between the Canadian grain and the Scottish malt is lost, the sweetness and freshness that the French and Spanish oak had to offer is also abesnt. It feels unusual to say this, but I recommend the NAS version over this one."

3.0,"If I had to summarize my opinion in one sentence: it could have been worse. For a whisky that is predominantly grains, I was surprised by the predominant malty note, with a certain herbaceousness and faint peat to the palate. There isn't really much here, and the lack of any offputting elements means this would probably work well in a highball. It's alright."
