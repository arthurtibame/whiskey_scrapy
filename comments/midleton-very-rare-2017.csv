4.0,Drank this in the distillers cottage atJameson Middleton. One of the smoothest whiskey's I have ever tasted. Carmel and vanilla with some fruit notes. The new bottle & box are something you would be proud to display on your home bar.

2.0,Price of entry is not worth the ride. Very singular and predictible taste. maybe if not cut to 40 abv there would be more to talk about.

No doubt some older refined whiskey
I enjoy notes of sherry in my scotch that seem to be missing and it is just too smooth too low proof for me personally except for a early in the day/ lunchtime drink. This would do well for me as a cask strength offering 
I would term this as whiskey ""lite"" maybe too well done, although certain this would appeal to the occasional whiskey drinker.
I give it a 4 because it is flawless but cannot rate it higher because it is devoid of the complexities, the proof and lacking classic sherry notes that i enjoy"

4.25,"Light copper in color. The nose is rich with overripe pears. It exhibits an extremely soft and silky mouthfeel and has a delicate sweetness with a nice, long gentle burn. I think the oft overused term “smooth” actually fits this pour well. 4.15."

4.5,"UPDATING to use new rating system. Comments are the same, just upped the score from 4 to 4.5 
Smooth, vanilla with subtle spice. The new packaging is great. I love this at ~$140-150, but the current price of ~$220 brings it down to 4.5 stars"

5.0,"I have no idea why this very fine whiskey is rated so ridiculously low. It is the smoothest whiskey to ever touch my lips, and a blend at that. Perhaps it is the smooth creamy nature of it that leaves people desiring another kind of whiskey experience. Only 80 proof? And, of course, the asking price (how much of that is the box? I can just hear people saying). All well and good as it will leave more of this wonderful very rare Irish liquor for me.
                
                $220 USD in PA"

4.0,"Master Distiller – Brian Nation.  Bottle Serial number 13407.

Light whiskey  full of juicy fruit flavours and spiciness on the finish. The blend, created by master distiller Brian Nation, comprises single pot still and grain whiskeys drawn from a batch of ex-Bourbon barrels with an age span of 12 to 32 years. Midleton Very Rare 2017 includes the oldest whiskeys used in the blend to date: 32-year-old grain whiskey and 26-year-old single pot still whiskey. 

Nose - Vibrantly fruity with aromas of apricots, pineapple, red apples, stem ginger, marzipan and fruit bread.
Taste - Soft, smooth and juicy. Flavours of apricots, dried citrus peel, honey, pineapple and mango. Delicate spices lead through to the finish.

5.0,"Irish whiskey. Everyone has an affinity for a spirit, usually its the first love, and this is irish whiskey to me. If you are an irish whiskey fan this is perfection in a glass. It takes the top spot as far as I'm concerned. On the nose its a more delicate Jameson, slightly more complex, and very inviting. Mouth feel is sensual, smooth, oily and lingering. Taste is liquid gold, buttercream icing, butter biscuit, and melted caramel. The finish is long and wonderful, its so smooth that I tend to hold it in my mouth for a good 30 seconds, and thats where the wood, and complexity shine. Briliant."

4.25,"A pretty flawless whiskey... although that doesn't come with a dose of excitement. I'd like to try this at 46% and luckily for me I have samples from that abv to cask strength buried in my cupboard so stay tuned for those reviews. Creme brulee, butterscotch and more...very very drinkable but I think I'd get bored of this if i had a bottle...and there is the price..."

4.75,Extremely well rounded as you'd expect from a 32 year old whiskey. It lingers for some time with the typical irish characters of honey and floral flavors. An oily mouthfeel and complex with a white chocolate yet also slightly earthy finish. Phenomenal but definitely a pretty penny!
3.5,"Not the biggest fan, but I understand why others like it."
5.0,"Nice delectable smooth stuff with notes of vanilla, salted caramel, peach, citrus, mango, banana, pineapple, cotton candy, cereal, pot still spices, and white chocolate. Not on redbreast Cask Strength/redbreast 21/Midleton Barry Crockett/Midleton Dair Ghaelach level but top notch nonetheless"

4.25,"I don't love grain whisky but this mix of aged grain and pot still is super refined, triple distilled and like butter. The nose is so Irish with fruit and honey, the palate is lightly spicy, semi-sweet and velvety. It is a very easy to drink dram with a mellow finish. It's a little thin and I think it would be better with a higher ABV but it's a small omission. It's like the Johnny Walker Blue of Ireland."
4.0,"On nose: red apple. On palate: fruity and very small spice. On finish: medium, sweet, fruity.
4.0 due to price, otherwise it would be 4.5 for me."
