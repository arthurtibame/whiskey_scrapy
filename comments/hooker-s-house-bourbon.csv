4.0,"Hooker's House Bourbon - Pinot Barrel finish

I will start with the disclaimer that I can see why many would dislike this whiskey; it has many different flavors than the usual bourbon and the wine tannins can confuse things further, especially for those not familiar with those flavors. However, I do not believe there are objective flaws with this whiskey other than the fact that its flavor combinations are polarizing. I happen to really enjoy the weird stuff going on all at once.

N: spent peanut shells, maple, bookshelves, and the wood of an old wharf
T: herbal, medicinal, thin, digestive herbs, and perhaps juniper. the pinot tannins seem to manifest themselves in this fashion like an Amaro
F: dry and tannic... like a temperate-climate grown pinot"

3.75,"Smooth, no burn, fruit."
3.5,"Smooth, lightly sweet."
4.0,"Almost as much rye as a bourbon. Not a beginner drink. High proof.
    Nose: Astrigent, incense, Herbal, raisins, nuts, hint of pinot noir aroma.
    Taste: Very peppery, fruity, spices. Oily and clingy. Bitter tannin and pinot noir aftertaste.
    How: With water or single ice cube. High proof.  Mellows out spiky notes  and makes it fruitier."
