4.0,Smooth and great taste for the price!
0.5,"Really mild, almost watery start, slight oak flavor, finish is mostly alcohol burn but again very mild.  If you don't drink alcohol, this won't burn your nose hairs.  If you do enjoy whiskey, skip this one."

4.0,"Starts off very heavy caramel and sweet, easy to drink.  Mid flavors are a little medicinal.  Finished quickly."
2.0,"Nose of those plastic glue bubbles from a small toothpaste tube  that you blow up on the end of a little red straw and Isopropyl alcohol. The nose is so sparse that I think I can smell my ice cubes over it. Mouthfeel of a glycerin suppository. Palate is sterile and astringent. Vanilla and an oaken dryness slip in briefly, but quickly vaporizes into nothingness. Better mix this one with some soda and turn up the country music a little louder."

1.5,A lot like a basic Canadian whisky—cloying sweetness with lots of grain ethanol on the nose and flavor. Like liquid candy corn.

4.0,Has a wonderful vanilla and almond aroma. Taste of vanilla and caramel. No spice and very smooth. I would recommend this for anyone to try.

2.5,"Musty corn, ethanol and a hint of vanilla on the nose, mild on the palate with a little corn and vanilla, the finish is short with a hint of mint."

3.0,"I wanted to hate this, since I live in Nashville and always thought of this as a gimmicky whiskey to sell to tourists. But it’s not bad. A lot of vanilla on the nose and palate and very sweet. And at 80 proof, it’s easy to drink."

2.5,"Nose: Grain alcohol, honey, some type of wood. 
Taste: Grain alcohol, mineral water, very slight honey.
Finish: Don't blink and weird 1-2 minute after taste. 
Probably a mixer for most, it'll be a dusty before long. 
But if you let it sit for about a 30 minutes you get Crown Royal Bourbon Mash. 
Go figure."
3.0,It’s smooth but light.
3.0,"Smooth, little after kick"
2.0,"watery start. hints of vanilla and oak barrels. slight afterburn. ok, but would pass if offered again."
