5.0,"My favorite whiskey so far. Heavy burnt caramel and fruit cake. Sweet basil, clove, navel oranges, and light vanilla. A bit of generic sherry in there too. Extremely sweet and smooth."

3.75,"Good everyday whisky. 

The concept of this distillery is very interesting. Recreating whisky with archives from the past of old lost distilleries."

3.5,"The nose is sherry like with dried fruit, chocolate, a touch of allspice and pepper. The palate is slightly oily and features the dried fruit with a bit of smoke, along with pepper to balance out the sweetness. The finish is medium and oily with fading dried fruit and pepper."
3.5,"Fruity, sherry with a reddish colour. Slight smell of a charcoal fire on the nose. Smooth during the start to middle - ends harsher. Nice!"
