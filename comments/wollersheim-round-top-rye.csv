3.0,"A bit harsh, even considering a rye. Peppery. Good to drink and local, but I think this may be a cocktail or a night when I want a little harshness...need to try it with water yet"
3.0,"Spice and caramel and sweet wood to my nose. Smooth, sweet, spice taste. Mild lingering finish. 

Kind of sweeter than most eyes I’ve had. 

Not an experienced taster, I just enjoy all kinds of whiskey however it’s spelled."
