4.75,"Just a phenomenal whiskey.  Not sure if it’s 10 years aged or just a 10th anniversary bottling, but it matters not.  At even 62.7% ABV it behaves like a much-older whiskey.  The nose and arrival are very similar to their Brimstone offering, but with a courteous sherry component that fits like a glove.    The smoke component is reminiscent of burning Post Oak and Mesquite, but never offensive.  If you can find this bottle, you’re a fool not to buy two."
