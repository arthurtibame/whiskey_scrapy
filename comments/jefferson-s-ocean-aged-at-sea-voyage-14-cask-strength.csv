Selected by NH. Barrel 144. Bottle 122."

5.0,"Straight from the bottle it had a sweetness quickly followed by a warmth that followed all the way down. Once mixed with coke zero, the sweetness carries more with an almost berry flavor that shows through that warmth. Outstanding either way you choose."

This is what happens when you put a good Kentucky bourbon to age on a ship for 6 months travelling the world’s oceans.  It tastes like a good Kentucky bourbon.  ‘MURRICA!  It’s like a weary xenophobic traveler that becomes only more ingrained in its traditional Kentucky roots after languishing in the greater world. 

Big cask strength Kentucky hug.  Vanilla, butterscotch, and dark fruits.  Huge bourbon spices: cinnamon, nutmeg, and dried orange peels.  Nicely balanced oak.  Where’s the ocean influence?  There is no brine, no salt, no “seaspray”, just Kentucky.  The bottling idea is gimmicky, but the contents are a solid classic.  The pricing for the non-CS releases are a little suspect, but at ~90 USD for a good CS bourbon, that’s fair, and I might pick up a bottle.

89/100."
4.0,actually was Voyage 16
4.0,"I am a big fan of these releases and the Voyage 10 is one of the best Bourbon's I've had.
Upon entry you are hit with a rich, viscous toffee and butterscotch note. Mid pallette features a spice swell that threatens to go out of balance but ultimately recedes to an oak and salt water taffee finish. Finish is medium to long. You get a nice Kentucky hug on the finish otherwise it's very smooth. Really easy to drink for the proof. 
This one is inferior to the Voyage 10 but still a really nice dram. 3.75/5."

4.0,"It's a pretty good bourbon and I really liked the cherry candy notes. The only negative I have is that it was a bit harsh (it had too much alcohol taste, reminded me of a young bourbon). But overall I really enjoyed this bourbon."

3.75,"That hot, hot heat! From start to finish, a whole lot of punch with oak, vanilla, and cherry jubilee. Might have picked up a bit of stone fruit crossing the Equator four damn times! Who knows what happens on that imaginary line?!"
4.25,Was a bit harsh in the finish at first but after sitting for a month the flavors really shine and smooth out. The ocean brine like quality comes through as well.

Drinks well below the ABV. Decent barrel character that balances the cherry and orange nicely. Hint of salt."

4.25,"Not an overpowering nose, considering the cask strength. Some orange and vanilla notes. The taste is strong in salted caramel which lingers long after the taste. Both the nose and more flavors come through when opening it up with a few drops of water.  A unique taste.  This relates to Liquor Land in Detroit bottling.  Batch 106 bottle 28"

4.5,"I’m not sure why this isn’t getting more love aside from the price. At cask strength I thought it would have more of an ethanol presence, but this was pleasantly smooth with some nice warmth on the back end. Nose to me consisted of apricot and butterscotch. Palate was sweeter than I expected at CS but had good flavor, not overly complex, but a solid bourbon profile. A long finish with nice warmth/burn.  Not thin as others stated, I thought this was fairly viscous with a nice oily mouthfeel."

3.75,This is very good. Sweet and drinks easy for cask strength. Not overly complex. Don’t taste much age but it does taste young. Moderate finish. Good. Not sure it is worth the price.

3.0,"A sample from dthom as part of the ""Whiskey transfer program"".

Nose: Sweet vanilla and honey notes with quite a bit of oak on the nose.  As this sat in the glass I started to get toasted nuts and dried fruits like figs and dates.  Just the lightest hint of sea air like one would get from an Islay Scotch in the background.

Flavor: Very sweet with dark sugars and musty wood.  Heavy ethanol burn.  Not as complex as the nose would suggest.

Finish:  Drying and spicy leading in to a bone dry oak finish.  Medium long.

I thought this was ok.  I wouldn't seek it out but it wasn't bad either.  Very interesting nose but a very bland taste and finish.  Sort of like this was almost special and just fell short."
