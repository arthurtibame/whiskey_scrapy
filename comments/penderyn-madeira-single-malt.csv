3.0,"Mainly fruity and sweet, with notes of cinnamon. Plain on the month, with a unpleasant finish for my taste (too neutral in the beginning)."

3.0,"It's not bad, but really nothing special going on.  Very straightforward and one dimensional.  Light, tropical fruits on the nose, followed by a light citrusy honey aroma on the pallete. Finish is quick and smooth."
3.0,"Nose: Smooth and sweet – much smoother than the taste. Starts out stingy and spicy, but it all fades away, turning the nose into smooth notes of oak and vanilla.

Taste: Oak, honey and vanilla are the main factors. Bit of spicy notes too. The nose did imply for a smooth taste but it turned out a bit too stingy.

Finish: Fruits last pretty long. Dry with sweetness of vanilla. Hints of oak.

Balance: An okay dram. Young and not in best balance but if a guy like me (doesn't like pointy and fruity palates) can grow to drink it, I guess anyone can."

4.0,"Not normally one for tasting notes but it says long lasting tropical fruits aftertaste on the box and you definitely get that. This is one way the hell out there whiskey, I'm not sure what's going on in Wales but this is pretty different to scotch. About as far from an islay as you can get... I can't decide if I like it or not, time for another glass"
3.0,A little kick right off the nose. Madeira Cask leaves its mark.

4.0,Possibly one of the most underrated and well priced  drams I have been fortunste enough to stumble across.  Wonderfully sweet and juicy flavours make this a real pleasure to sip.  46% and no chill filtration has really done this whisky some favours.  Better than Glen Morangie Nectar D'or in my opinion.

4.0,"Agree with tasting notes. Elegant smooth blackberry fruit on the forefront, with a wonderful pine forest on the followthru. Apple and pear arrive on the finish with a hint of cinnamon.   I think its the pine forest that makes it unusual.... a truly unique dram.  So glad i followed thru on my inkling.  This will b a regular in my drams. I will taste more of the Penderyn expressions."
4.0,"I purchased my first bottle of Penderyn tonight after taking my daughter to the pumpkin patch and lightshow. I frankly did not know what to expect. I usually read thoroughly about a whisky before buying but didnt get a chance this time around. 

I have to say that I am very pleased with this whisky. The nose hits you softly but with character. It mimics that perfume of the girl you ran into at the elevator and as she walks away her sweet, fruity and delicate scent lingers behind and leaves you wondering. The palate is quite special. It took me some thinking to pin dowm what fruit it was that I was sensing. After mulling it over I came to the conclusion that it is maracuya (passion fruit). It is a fruit from the amazon that grows in south america. Total nostalgia. It had been more than a decade since I tasted that flavor. I wish the finish was a little longer but you cant beat the quality of this whisky for the price."

4.0,It's good. Tastes strongly of banana? Would drink again but never after a really nice whisky.
4.0,"If you like Japanese whisky give this young distillery a try, well balances and intriguing it is worth the purchase for those seeking variety. Fruity and smooth, it opens with its sherry casting, a swish in the mouth brings forth apple, pear, and a hint of cask oils. A delicate finish does not overwhelm the senses but leaves a paleasent after taste."

3.75,"Five years ago we played a unique links course in Wales called Nefyn & District. It was naturally formed on a cliffy promontory that extends out into the Irish Sea. There’s a spectacular view of the jagged coastline from every hole, and the day we played the winds were blowing unmercifully. By tradition everyone takes the footpath on the 12th down to the Ty Coch Inn nestled on a tiny beach below. Here, you have time for a quick pint and few laughs then it’s off to the 13th.  From this tee a solid drive is required to carry a deep precipice and the ocean below to the final piece of peninsula that takes you out to a lighthouse at 14.  From a tee next to the lighthouse you only have 150 yards to the par 3 green well below, but it was into a solid wall of wind coming off the ocean at 30+ mph. Balls were landing everywhere but near the green, and we were having a grand ole time. That night I had my first introduction to Penderyn, a young distillery that is Wale’s only and first in over a 100 years. Our drinks arrived and I barely had the Maderia Finish in my grasp when a fellow golfer knocked over an entire glass of Cabernet onto my tan khakis. Jumping out of my chair, it still amazes me how someone looking like the victim of attempted murder could produce that much laughter. Our accommodations were nearby, but I decided to tough it out to the taunts and teasing of eight other golfers. Despite my predicament I really enjoyed the whisky that night and have been keeping an eye out for Penderyn ever since. Recently, I ordered a sample to see if the Madeira Finish still held the magic from that trip. The nose is one of the most elegant that I have experienced in a whisky. Red grapes (primarily Tinta Negra or Negra Mole) make up 85% of those grown to make Madeira wine and the casks used to finish this spirit. Bottles of this fortified vino have been known to survive up to 300 years. This gives the whisky a scent of red grape fruitiness that blends with and enhances the 46% ABV in such a way that is very inviting. I usually try to nose around the alcohol, but in this case I couldn’t inhale deep enough to drink in the exquisite fragrance of this award winning wysgi (Welsh). This robust fruitiness carries forward along with a dry delivery to simulate a measure of sweetness that really hits the spot. The mouth feel has a peppery effervescence that excites the palate and tastes like grapes, almonds, and vanilla beans ricocheting everywhere. It was tremendously satisfying to this point; unfortunately, the finale was lacking. The sweetness takes a quick exit and leaves a finish that is smooth but somewhat flat, similar to a dry Fino sherry mixed with an unwanted spiciness. These two intruders add a measure of complexity that might be more welcome under different circumstances. A stumble at the finish line has this whisky falling minutely short of 4 stars."

4.25,"Au nez : doux et sucré, bonbon acidulé type “tétine de mammouth”, une note florale et herbale, voire de pelouse, une touche de vin et peut être de fruits-rouges
Au palais : doux tendre et sucré, des notes de fruits rouges cette fois-ci très présentes, également une note de pêche/abricot, on retrouve le bonbon, une note de vin légère et un très léger bois amandé et une note de colle 
La finale est courte, sur le fruit rouge, la mûre particulièrement mais également une note de pêche au sirop

Avec un peu de temps, le nez et le palais s’ouvriront sur des notes plus boisées assez agréables


Note personnelle 89/100

Super whisky frais, fruité et sucré, un whisky qui sent bon le printemps, en plus d’être assez original et singulier, le tout dans un dram très équilibré. Et puis cette touche de pêche au sirop..... On lui reprochera seulement son manque de complexité et de “tenue” dans le sens où toutes les saveurs arrivent d’un coup et en même temps puis disparaissent, on est donc à l’affût des notes avant qu’elles ne s’enfuient"

3.25,"This is my first tasting notes experience here, so please forgive the length.

This was a gift from a Coworker of my Husband while on a trip to London. His Coworker was from Wales and presented it at dinner as the only Distillery in Wales. 

This is the Madeira Cask finish. I get a nice Oak and berry smell, with a strong bite of alcohol coming off my Glencairn. On my tongue, it is thick and fruity; with whiffs of butterscotch floating between the whiskey and the roof of my mouth, making me think this would be really great with Pancakes and BlackBerry Syrup.  Heat this up and add it to it like a hot toddy. 

The flavor stays well after a minute between sips, and the initial strength of the 46% apv settles down to the point that I can more than happy having my nose buried in my glass, and I find myself concocting recipes using this. 

As a gift, this is a great Whiskey.  I have no idea the price range, so I can’t really speak to that. 

I like it though. At the end of the day, I know there will be nights where I pour myself a Dram from this bottle. Isn’t that what matters most?"
