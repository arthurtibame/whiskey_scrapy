4.25,"Nose: fruity, oak, old leather and chocolates, spearmint?
Palate: cinnamon sugar, vanilla, caramel. Red fruits and charred oak.
Finish: short. Peppery minty and oaky

Over all a good sipper that can be enjoyed all night. If you're looking for something slightly different than your standard sweet corn profile this fits the bill. It really is a nice pour. It would shine more at a higher proof, @ 90 proof it seems a little thin and watery. I really do like this one and always buy a bottle when I can find it."

Taste - peanuts, caramel, vanilla, cherry, burnt brown sugar, moderately tannic, medium ethanol burn, finishing mildly sweet and spicy with a hint of leather.

Overall, an amazing value for the price. Solid bourbon notes all the way through, but falls slightly short of higher-end offerings."

Palate: peppery (not spicy). Definitely can taste the oak with hints of honey.  Simple, but flavorful.  

Finish: mild finish - very smooth.  No alcohol burn - just a warm fuzzy feeling all over.  There is no one thing outstanding, but the all the parts combined makes this I damn good bourbon.  

Overall: Unlike many bourbons, Eagle Rare lives up to the hype.   Would make a great gift of appreciation for a co-worker."

4.0,"I am finally getting around to writing this after receiving a bottle of Eagle Rare over the holidays. This is a solid but somewhat hard to find Bourbon (in my area) that seems to have a bigger flavor than Buffalo Trace. It has a wonderful vanilla nose and sweetness or fruitness that I really liked with the finish being a slow release with a touch of wood. I really, really like to way the flavor lingers in my mouth. I prefer this on the rocks vs neat I think the dilution opens up this Bourbon a great deal. This stuff makes an outstanding Old Fashioned the flavors in this go with the bitters very well and next to Sazerac rye it is my favorite spirit to make an Old Fashioned. I usually make a Manhatten evaluate the spirit, but unfortunately, my sweet vermouth had turned and when I mixed it the drink tasted like burnt pencil erasers and while I did try to finish it the drink terrible. Overall I really like this stuff and will continue to stock it in my bar. I have read many of the reviews and am a bit worried about finding a bad bottle but still as Robin Hood said in the Disney version ""the faint heart never won the fair maiden"". I enjoyed this enough to continue to stock this as space is available in my bar. Enjoy."

Bottled at 45%abv, with a russetmuscat color.

On the nose is a typical bourbon, but not complex at all. Banana, banana split, vanilla ice cream. Clove. 

On the palate is fair, it is a thick dram, with tangerine, lots of pepper and clove. Finish is warm and pleasant but could be more interesting. 

Adding water to this dram will reveal lemon notes on the nose and more spicy on the palate. 

Overall i give this dram an 82 over 100 and would recommend it only if you find it cheap, since i wouldn't pay more than 40 dollars for it."

The taste is more cinnamon, potpourri, and a good amount of charcoal. A little bit of heat burns through. The corn emerges here along with cracked wood. 

That finish stays on the Cinnamon brand. The burn is pleasant and non-threatening. Sits in the tongue comfortably. Old tobacco pulls up the rear, again like a, comfortable pair of slippers. Some rich woods come out too."

Adding one teaspoon of water immediately improves the flavor, while the mouthfeel is lost.  The finish remains oaky, bitter, and chewy.  An average score - however, the bottle design blows the socks off any other bourbon bottle. Is it worth the $35 I paid?  It does.  While I'll never refuse a glass, I won't be picking up a bottle anytime soon.

I use the rating scale below. Distiller uses a scale of 5 and I use a scale of 10, but I’m sure you’re not too drunk to do the math! 

1. Disgusting - So bad I poured it out.
2. Poor - I wouldn't consume by choice.
3. Bad - Multiple flaws.
4. Below average - Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.
5. Good - Just average.

Nose - sweet, some vanilla, leather. Picking up something else maybe fruity or floral but subtle

Taste - sweet and complex. Starts off sweet and a bit fruity. Smooth finish long lasting on the tongue with some cinnamon that eventually gets a little bitter.

Overall and value
A super smooth and complex 10 year bourbon for around 30$? Yes please! This is a very solid bourbon. My only issue is it’s availability and allocation. Very hard to find in my area. Solid choice for all bourbon lovers."

4.5,"A great bourbon. The price seems to be climbing to nearly $50 in many shops, but if you can find it at the SRP of around $30-35, it is a bargain for a classy complex bourbon. It noses of vanilla, heated brown sugar, oak, and a little dark cherry. These flavors are resplendent on the tongue. There is also heat, perhaps a little more than the typical 10 year old bourbon. On the finish there is cinnamon and all-spice blending with corn sweetness and old leather. Very good, the senior class of Buffalo Trace bourbon."

Such an enjoyable bourbon, that's not sickenly sweet and at 45 percent alcohol, it gives it enough kick to be interesting. I'm definitely looking at a repeat bottle purchase, this is my new go to bourbon, edging out four roses single barrel."

Nose: Pears, Apple Pie, Vanilla, Oak, Chocolate, a slightly muted copper/metal

Taste: Marzipan, Orange, Vanilla, Caramel, Apple Hi-Chews, Oak/Pepper bite

Finish: Sweet fruity aftertaste with a hint of cinnamon that lingers, and an ever so slight coat of wax on the tongue for good measure

Overall: This is shockingly similar to my bottle of EH Taylor SmB, which can retail for $30+ more here in NYC. The nose and palate are somewhat muted, but this dram punches well above its weight class. Will be using this as my nightly bourbon pour!

(5/1/20)"

It's a step up from Buffalo Trace, but below Weller 107 and Taylor.

A unique (in my experience) product. Yes, the top line tastes of caramel and cocoa and apple at the sweeter end are delivered with some power. Enough tart to avoid any charge of being sickly.

Palate is initially rich and sweet, loaded with caramel and baking spice. In the background there is also chocolate which I don’t normally find in bourbons so it’s a welcome addition.

It transitions to finish smoothly, giving far more warmth then you expect and lasting far longer too.

When you’re finished with your sip you are left reflecting on how rich and full it was, and while not complex, the rounded edges make it taste far more expensive then it is."
