4.5,"Nose- Pecan pie, pears, cocoa powder, caramel, vanilla, apples

Palate- Pecans again, oak, cinnamon, red apples, caramel, rye spices

Finish- Medium-long, chewy finish with red apples, rye spices, and pecan pie


Nose is very good. On the sweeter side for sure, with a distinct pecan pie note that sticks out. Theres also fresh fruits, vanilla, and caramel. The palate is the opposite of the nose. The pecans show up immediately, but quickly give way to oak, spices, and a bit of fruit. The finish could be longer, but is very enjoyable, with that familiar pecan note and delicious red apples."

4.0,Very unique
4.25,"Nose (4.25): not as fragrant as I had expected but very pleasing.  Caramel, marischino cherries, and some browned sugar dominate.  Slight astringency that I knocked it for, but it clears after letting in set a bit.  This needs some air time to get the full effect.

Palate (4.5):  Cherries carry forward from the nose with some oak.  Mouthfeel is buttery and inviting.  Coats the palate nicely.  There is a bit of pepper and smoke that come through burnt brown sugar.  

Finish (4): I expected a longer finish but this one leaves you quickly.  More of the oak is prevalent with that sweetness.  It dries too quickly for me.

This was very good bourbon but I am thinking a bottle should be half the MSRP.  Compared it next to ECBP B518 in a blind and the ECBP got 4 of 6 votes.  That saying I would buy 2 bottles of alot of the $65-$80 bourbons out there and be just as happy.  If you can get an affordable bar pour though, definately go for it."

3.75,"Sweet but feels thin and the flavors quickly fade with only the presence of the alcohol burn. It’s good, but not $150 good. If it was under $75 then it would be a better value."

4.25,"The nose starts out floral and creamy along with notes of oak, coconut and a touch of molasses and mint in the background. The palate is brown butter and warm with cinnamon followed by mint, molasses and a hint of oak. The finish is medium long and spicy with cinnamon, mint and brown butter. Spicy food cancels out the spiciness of the bourbon, leaving wonderful creaminess."

4.0,I like this one a lot but my good buddy tried it and said it tastes like armor all. Now I can’t stop thinking tasting it. I still thinks it’s great but can’t name a different taste.

4.25,"A sample generously gifted by bourbonjosh24.

Nose: Vanilla up front with quite a bit of poached pear.  Some oak with background notes of rye grassiness and an earthy note I can't quite put my finger on.

Flavor: Vanilla, dark sugar, and poached pear with quite a bit of toasted pecan.  Kind of like pecan pie with fruit in it.  Delicious but sweet.

Finish:  Very oaky with some rye spiciness.  Fairly long finish that gets drier as time goes on and the sweetness fades nicely in to the barrel notes."
