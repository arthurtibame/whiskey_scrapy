4.0,"With Disney Land Paris closing down this weekend, our planned family trip went down the drain. While I do understand the importance of some level of self-quarantine to control the spreading of the virus, personally I'm not all too worried, but since public social life has plummeted, we make it ourselves nice and cozy with some blankets, snacks and why not... spirited drinks.

My choice for today is the rather rare 13-year-old 'Inchfad'. The 'Inchfad' is - spoiler-alert -  really wonderful heavily peated highland-whisky by Loch Lomond distillery. It's apparently rarely seen as a Single Malt. Bottled by Hunter Laing under it's 'Hepburn's Choice' brand, it's a single-cask release, with only 345 bottles available. Now there's one less... :).

While it's color (pale straw) clearly gives away that this 'Inchfad' hasn't been finished in wine, sherry or any other special cask, it's taste nevertheless doesn't fail to impress.

The nose was at first somewhat sulfury, but after a short breath, the sulfur disappeared and the nose became sweet and smoky.
On the palate, the Inchfad is full and oily, and confirms the sweet vanilla of the nose, while even adding some more gentle peat-smoke and a hint of fresh apples. It's a round and full dram, but not too complicated.
The aftertaste lingers on for a moderate while and first is smoky and oily and at the end slightly salty.

At this price level, this seems a tough one to beat. If you come across this bottle, and you like a sweet, peaty dram that is not overly complicated: don't hesitate."
