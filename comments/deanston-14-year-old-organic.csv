2.25,"Light and easy sipper. Tastes a little younger than 14 years old. Sugar babies, lemon and melted whipped cream. Watery, short finish. 

Update ... I’m now at the end of the bottle and it hasn’t gotten much more interesting. It’s really young tasting - almost like new make. Would never guess that it’s 14 years old. 

I hate that I don’t like this one because I really admire what Deanston did with making it 100% organic. But taste buds don’t lie. Would take Hazelburn 10 over this any day."
