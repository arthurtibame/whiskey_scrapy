4.5,This got me hooked on the Medley's brand. I am always on the lookout for their distinct bottle shape now.

3.0,"Classic nose. On the palate, the rye notes stand out, good spice. Herbal and spicy. Balanced sweetness. Spice lingers. 1/25/18"

5.0,I was interested and intrigued by this bourbon mostly because the bottle seems to be an exact replica of the Elmer T Lee glass. I was not disappointed by the bourbon. Great depth of flavor and long-lasting aftertaste. Maybe this bourbon has alluded me in the past because I have never seen it before and the store clerk knew nothing about it. I wish I had another bottle.
