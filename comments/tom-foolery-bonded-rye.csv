3.0,"This is very “rye”. Not a lot of complexity. If you want something that it is quintessential rye, get it.  You will like the green pickle notes. Seems like this would be better in a few more years in the barrel."
5.0,"Rich and oily with lots of oak. Buttery, creamy mouth feel. Savory, spicy finish goes on forever. Would be a good fit for fans of Whistle Pig 10 year barrel proof. Bottle from barrel #125, distilled 12/12 and bottled 12/18."
