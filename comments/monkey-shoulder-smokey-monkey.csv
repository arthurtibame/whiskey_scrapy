3.25,"While I regularly enjoy the ‘regular’ Monkey Shoulder, I never had the opportunity to try and taste the smokier version of it. Being only released to bars and hotels (to be served basically in cocktails and mixers, but also on it’s own), it’s not very widespread available. Unofficially it’s a triple malt blend of The Balvenie, Glendfiddich and Aisla Bay, but that isn’t confirmed. I’ve been able to purchase a bottle now, and was pretty eager to sample it. 

On the nose I got some medicinal peaty notes, that come back on the palate, but it then quickly reveals some sweetness. Stone fruits, but also liquorice. Some breathing may remedy the initial medicinal taste, though. 
Then, on the aftertaste, I really enjoyed the soft, sweet, smokeyness. 

Knowing the original Monkey Shoulder, expectations were actually rather high for this one, but it didn’t disappoint. I rate it 3.25!"

4.0,"Monkey Shoulder is a blend of three Speyside distilleries, that are not 100% confirmed *Cough* Balvenie, Glenfiddich and Kininvie *Cough*. A great dram on its own, but as a bartender I use it as a base in a shed load of whisky based cocktails, so I’m hoping Smokey Monkey will have the same attributes. As well as adding an extra smokey layer to well know classics such as Rob Roy, Blood and Sand, Whisky Mac etc. As for the whiskies in the blend, they haven’t been 100% Confirmed *Cough* Balvenie, Glenfiddich and Ailsa Bay *Cough* from what I can gather anyway.  I first tried this dram in March before its official release in August, at the time I wasn’t in any state to be writing tasting notes. But today I have got my hand on some more and I was not disappointed!
 
Nose
An initial light dusty medicinal peat, backed up by rich butterscotch, smokey brine with a hint of dried stone fruit.
 
Palate
Coating mouthfeel, with initial citrus notes followed by butterscotch, toffee and then follows up with light smokey peat towards the end.
 
Finish
A building finish, with the creamy butterscotch first then building into spicy citrus notes, the end dry and smokey.
Verdict
Well, I’m not disappointed, easy drinking, very accessible while still having a lot going on. The citrus notes complement the light coastal smoke perfectly. I think it will be perfect for first-time smokey whisky drinkers and as for cocktails I’m looking forward to trying it out, I’m pretty sure it is going to work perfectly."

2.0,"Nose is smoke brine and peat with a the sweetness of cured meats

Plalate is a lot of smoke and this is where it lets itself down as that’s all I can taste .

Finish is medium and more smoke."
