3.0,"Nose - (w/o water) Sweet fruit, vanilla smoke, hint of iodine, Wheaties cereal, slightly metallic, lemon zest (w/ water) More of a sweet salty smoke, lemon citrus hinted light fruit juice.

Taste - (w/o water) White pepper & smoke tingle, citrusy lemon zest, sweet pear, lightly salty cured/smoked meat, like a weird mix between a beef brisket & a ham (w/ water) More of a sweet/savory smoke, very clean & juicy, sweet smoke more prominent on the backend.

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering white pepper tingle, sweet salty smoke, light saline, fruity green fruits, savory meat (w/ water) Lingering saline/smoke, light white pepper warmth, charcoal/ash, light ""fresh"" fruits.

Score - 77/100

Final Thoughts - This wasn't that bad of a peated expression for me, but it seemed a bit one dimensional and I wish I could somehow have the nose & taste of the Scotch with water, with the finish I got without water. It was quite a bit more enjoyable but mellow with water, but the finish with water was more ashy as opposed to a more fruity, clean smoke. That being said, the years in oak has tamed the smoke/peat considerably, but it's still not something I'd reach for.

Would I drink it if offered? - Maybe

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"
