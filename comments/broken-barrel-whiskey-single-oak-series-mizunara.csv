5.0,This is a great value for anyone looking to explore Japanese style Whiskey at an affordable price.  I loved it.  Subtle mouth feel and incredibly i could not believe it was 100 proof.  I would definitely buy this one again.  Beautiful label as well!
5.0,"This is an interesting whiskey because it begins with a bright apple flavor and vanilla character that folds into more of an almost floral finish. It is easy to drink at 50%, and does not need ice. It's a very unique thing the brand did putting corn whiskey with Japanese wood. So cool. When I finish the first bottle, if I see another I would buy again. Recommended."
3.0,"A pretty strong whisky up front, but then it balances out, and there is not quite much of a finish. It doesn't seem to leave that good mizunara aftertaste, however it is still present."
1.5,"Overwhelming craft essence. Aroma has a lot of grain notes and woody notes, it gets a tad spirity as it opens; Palate pulls through mostly raw woody notes and opens up to some banana chips, grain and spirity notes also continue to build; Finish is pleasant but also turns a tad spirity as it opens."
