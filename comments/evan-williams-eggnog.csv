2.0,Not a fan of egg nog and liquor
3.0,better off making your own this is alright but too strong of a whiskey taste for good eggnog
3.0,"Mix Kentucky Straight Bourbon, blended whiskey, rum and brandy; add the eggs, milk, cream, sugar and spices and you get the taste of Christmas past. What’s not to like."
2.5,Pre-mixed egg nog and Evan Williams whiskey. You can definitely taste and feel the whiskey; leaves a nice warmth in the belly. Not bad for $10.

3.0,Not a bad eggnog. you definitely know the bourbon is there.
1.75,"I’d prefer buying regular eggnog and mixing it with my own bourbon of choice, but this is worth trying if you like eggnog, particularly because it is so cheap."
