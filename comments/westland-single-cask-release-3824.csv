null,617 cask strength
5.0,"Fantastic stuff. At nearly 5 years old (58 months), this cask strength whiskey is mellower than I expected for almost 55% ABV. Strong presence of dark sugar and raisins on the nose, with a warm, rich palate that shows off a fudgy sweetness and notes of caramel, oak, and baking spices. I'm thankful I live in Seattle so I can snatch a bottle (or 3)."
