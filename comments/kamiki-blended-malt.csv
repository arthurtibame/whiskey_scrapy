3.25,Thin Peated Whiskey with half the mouthfeel of a good Peated scotch.
3.25,"On the nose you get a cigar box smell without the cigars inside. The cedar cask is definitely in the driver’s seat with this whisky and it is an acquired taste. Fun to try it, but wouldn’t purchase another bottle."
3.5,"Smooth, aroma of a Cuban cigar"
3.25,"Nose: Sandal wood/humidor.Flowery.

Flavour: Flowery, bit of a bite. Slight hint of humidor.

Finish: Still getting flowers and sandal wood. Last a fair bit."
3.5,"This whiskey is matured on cedar cask, which allows me to get a very distinct aroma on the nose.  On the palate I get fruits followed by a slight short burn, which is nice considering an ABV of 48%.  A few drops of water opens it up and the cedar aroma dissipates to the back and on the palate, more fruity and delicate."

3.0,"Malty nose, spicy notes on the initial taste giving way to smooth woody taste with a hint of fruit. Finish is a bit short and lacks complexity. Hint of tea and the spice returns."
3.0,Heavily wooded nose and taste. Seems a bit young & rough.
2.75,"Nose - Lightly floral, honey, sandalwood, roasted barley tea, hints of Chinese herbal medicine roots, dried ginseng, cedar

Taste - Dried goji berries, hint of dried oolong tea, dried Chinese red dates, ginger heat, dried persimmon

Finish - Lingering fruity barley tea, light candied ginger, Chinese red dates, dried persimmon sweet

Score - 70/100

Final Thoughts - This was...interesting I guess. Had an interesting nose that I've only gotten before from a young specialty barley whiskey I had once at Westland Distillery in Seattle, WA. The cedar influence was very apparent but there was also this weird Chinese herbal medicine vibe/funk I got out of this one. This one tasted quite young and although interesting, was kind of weird. Didn't really feel very well put together and not sure if the cedar influence was just overpowering the malt or what, but it was just kind of weird all around.
