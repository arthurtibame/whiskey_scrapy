2.0,"I wish I could have sampled it before j bought. Very underwhelming. I wouldn't pay more than $50 for this bottle. Definitely not worth the $150 I paid for it. It lack flavor, complexity and fullness. It's nice to have in my collection since it's the first older bourbon they've produced but thats the only thing it has going for it. Bottom line: sub-par bourbon for the price. Still it would only be a okay (maybe good) bourbon at 50-60 dollars. Just my opinion."

2.0,"$299 a bottle in Aus. Drank some took the rest back to the local bottle shop and gave it to the young guy that works there to drink. He likes wild turkey way more than me I guess.  for this price you can get Blantons barrel strength, or EH Taylor, or Stagg Junior wow, just wow..."

3.0,"This is a well balanced and easy to drink WT.  While the proof came in surprisingly below 90, nothing is missing from the Wild Turkey flavor profile.  It does seem lacking, in my opinion, when compared to Russell's Reserve Single Barrel.  However,  I have only had one glass so far and that may not be a fair comparison.  At $135 I will want to savor this for quite a while..."

4.0,Tried it at big red liqours pappy fest in Indy. It was good but I would never pay $100+ for a bottle. It has that familiar wild turkey flavor with a little bit more oak. To me it is similar to a lot of the Kentucky spirit bottles I have had. But I prefer the higher proof of Kentucky Spirit... to get to the point save your money.

4.0,"Great nose, classic bourbon. Flat on the front end, maybe some honey and anise, but long finish, with brown sugar, vanilla, wood, spice. I can see why some say this is too smooth, but the flavors are there. 7/7/17
  What a great nose, may have even opened up since I first cracked the bottle, seems fuller. Wood spice, cider, honey, some vanilla and nutmeg. On the palate, brown sugar, cinnamon, zest, leather, and turpentine.  Was a bit thin the first time, but seems much chewier now. Long finish, a lingering dark chocolate and orange peel. 8/30/17"

5.0,"Tried this recently at a tasting side by side with the Decades. And although the low proof I must point out that it's a delightful dram with an AMAZING NOSE! The Nose actually gets better the longer it sits out , and the Cherry notes become more prominent. Amazing Pour I would say a 93 out of 100"

4.0,"Nose - Sweet cherries, vanilla, creamy caramel, oaky butterscotch.

Taste - Spicy cinnamon oaky caramel, hint of fresh cherries, bit thin but mouth coating oaky dryness, oaky butterscotch.

Finish - Lingering light bitter oaky sweet, more fresh dark cherries, oaky brown simple.

Score - 82/100

Final Thoughts - So this had a very nice nose, nice hints of fresh dark cherries mingled with a dark caramel/butterscotch but that's really where this bourbon shines the most. I have a feeling they had a set of 17 year old barrels picked out for this release and found out that they had a great nose but were a bit overoaked so they watered it down to 43.4% in order to attempt to tame the oak & make it more palatable. It's not bad by any means, but it's a bit thin on the mouthfeel and a bit over drying in the mouth due to the oak. I normally can tolerate quite a bit of oak in my bourbons, but this seemed a bit much and not as well balanced as it could be, especially for the price premium.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Not anymore

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

3.0,"Exceptionally smooth whiskey, but it stops there. For $150 bottle this is a pretty big let down.  Not much flavor to speak of. Amazingly smooth, but low ABV, high price, and nothing special will make this a ‘not recommend.” At $50 a bottle it would be a buy."

4.0,"Note: my pour was from a nearly empty bottle. Very grassy/herbal, maybe cedar on the nose with a little cough medicine. Palate is not as grassy, with more typical bourbon flavors. Very smooth finish. A couple of drops of water dissipate the herbal notes and bring in maple syrup. The palate still has hints of cedar, but loses a little complexity and adds a slight bitterness that in my experience is fairly common when adding water."

4.75,"Loved this one again but was once again slightly put off by the nostril-searing nose.
Once on the palette though it delighted as always and the finish is so long and mellow. I just love this dram but have to stop sniffing so hard I guess"
4.75,"Lots of vanilla and spice on the palette with potent caramel hitting suddenly in the finish. Delicious. 
Only weakness is a slightly simple nose"
5.0,"I can get caramel and raisin on the nose, and the body is RIDICULOUSLY smooth. The flavors are so subtle it takes some time to pick them out. The raisin carries through on the body, along with the flavors of sangria. There is literally zero heat and zero spice on the backend. It’s remarkable. The body hits and dissolves almost immediately. On this very dry finish, the sangria transitions to a lemon zest that lingers longer than I expected. Even now, I still have lemon flavor. Not my favorite entry in the Master’s Keep series, but genuinely complex and enjoyable."

4.5,"Delicious, elegant but still with the upfront and in your face punch of spicy and sweet you’d expect from WT. Considering the bottled proof, this has all of the wonderful characteristics and taste you would expect. It’s vicious, lovely mouthfeel, taste is a blast of spice, caramel, vanilla and a great amount of wood. Gorgeous color and long legs. Cheers!"

3.5,"This tastes like an older version of WT101. A little heavier and deeper, but all the same flavors are there. This has almost a bitter finish that sticks around the sides of your tongue. Not bad by any means, but hardly worth the price of entry in my opinion.
I much prefer Russel's Reserve over this for both cost and taste factors."

4.0,"Barbeque, oak, and sweet fruit on the nose. Pepper, cinnamon, and nutmeg spices at first taste. Slight fruitiness, mild. Herbal aftertaste. Not much punch or depth.This could have been a great bourbon, but the relatively low proof holds it back. Drinking neat is required."

4.5,Not a great value but if you are a wild turkey fan this is an excellent bourbon. Pleasant wood on the nose and on the pallet. Starts off a bit spicy but mellows wonderfully after sipping the glass for 20 minutes or so and wonderful layers start to shine through on the finish.
4.0,Very nice to try a pour from a friend’s collection. Got plenty of aged vanilla and oak notes with that wild Turkey funk mixed in. Nice palate and finish. All around very enjoyable older whiskey for sure.

4.0,"Definitely my least favorite Master’s Keep release to date. The nose is somewhat dry with a bold aroma of Oak, nutmeg & all spice. Oak is present again on the palette along with light hints of caramel & orange peel. The proof is low which leaves the mouthfeel a bit thin and the finish a bit brief. This is good don’t get me wrong, it’s just me least favorite MK."

4.5,"Preparing to enjoy your last meal before embarking on the great time travel journey? Sit back with a glass of this. 

Oak, vanilla, spice, little bit of caramel. THIS is what bourbon is supposed to be."
5.0,"Neat.  Neck pour.  Incredible nose.  Oak and vanilla.  Cream and berries.  Cherries.  Hint of pepper.  Cinnamon.  I could spend an hour just sniffing this.

Thicker on the palate than I was expecting at 86 proof.  Vanilla and cinnamon all of the tongue.  Hits you with spiciness and then mirrors all the flavors from the nose.  Oak.  Berries and cream.  Cherry.  It is so oily (the legs are the thickest I have seen) that it just coats all of the mouth and throat.  Because of this the flavors actually magnified on the finish and linger for a long long time.

This is a definitive Wild Turkey experience.  Holy crap."

4.5,"Stuck in the Orlando airport for my flight home...thanks to our government shutdown.  Shortage of TSA and air traffic controllers is causing a backlog of planes sitting on runways.  How better to spend time at an airport for delayed flights than having a nice pour of top shelf bourbon.  This bourbon is big and burly, but with just enough finesse to let you know it’s aged well.  Marvel’s Punisher mixed in with Avenger’s Black Widow.  You get a huge hit of oak, but amazingly well balanced with orange, vanilla and pumpkin spices like nutmeg  and cinnamon.  At $15/pour —-well worth it.  I need to hunt down a bottle"

4.5,"The nose is very subtle with oak upfront, along with vanilla, caramel, orange zest, some smoke and mild baking spices, primarily cinnamon and nutmeg. The palate is somewhat dry and warms the mouth with cinnamon and clove, followed by vanilla, a good amount of oak and some caramel, all coating the mouth. The finish is medium long with cinnamon and oak that lingers and fades with vanilla underneath. Excellent."
