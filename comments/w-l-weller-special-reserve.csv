4.25,"Happy Days are here. I went on a business trip recently and they had Weller Special Reserve on the shelf. I bought some to bring back to South Carolina for gifts for friends and family because we have all been looking for this. When I first got serious about drinking whiskey a few years ago my local store would get this in nearly weekly but as of this week, they have not had any in the last 4 months. So what does this taste like to me? It tastes of soft vanilla and caramel with a light touch of oak. The burn I feel is right as I feel the liquid go down and the aftertaste is great. I used to make Old Fashioneds and Manhattans with this but the harder it is to find the less I mix it and save it for special occasions. I really like this Bourbon but do hate that it has become so scarce in my area. I used to say this was a great introductory Bourbon because of the price but now I have to save it for other things. Lastly, I agree with Ctrexman from the review below about the bourbon being on the sweet side making me happy and at just how good Buffalo Trace's products are. Enjoy"

4.5,"Never had a W.L. Weller before. I have seen thousands of photos and read great reviews on this brand. 

Well my veredict is: AWESOME WHISKEY. Lets get into business:

45%abv, this is a bourbon but the rye part of the mashbill has been replaced with wheat. 

On the nose, incredibly complex. Almost perfect. Prunes; Smoky like cigarrette on the nose. Pretty interesting, Matured cherries, like a cherry wine. Old Strawberries. Strawberry marmalade. 

On the palate is great. Prune liquor, Astrigent, Raisins liquor, Winey and oily. Very interesting. Wheat notes.

Aftertaste is ginger and peppery. Long.

Overall this is an amazing dram. 90 over 100 totally recommended."

2.75,"Pleasant overall on the nose with light floral scents as well as typical fruit and caramel notes; some ethanol.  Palate has cinnamon coming through, however it’s really thin and light.  The finish is very short with no residual Kentucky hug that I look for in a bourbon.  As an everyday sipper, it’s easy and smooth, but there is very little complexity.  I honestly don’t see the fuss, but if you can find it at retail pricing, it’s not a bad find."

Definitely a step down from the Weller 107 and the 12-year, both of which are personal favorites stylistically.  This one’s skinny, short, and uncomplicated.  It’s a good sipper for the price, but that’s about it."

I use the rating scale below. Distiller uses a scale of 5 and I use a scale of 10, but I’m sure you’re not too drunk to do the math! 

1. Disgusting - So bad I poured it out.
2. Poor - I wouldn't consume by choice.
3. Bad - Multiple flaws.
4. Below average - Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.
5. Good - Just average.
6. Very Good - Better than average.
7. Great - Well above average.
8. Excellent - In a league of its own.
9. Incredible - An all-time favorite.
10. Perfect"

4.25,This is a great bourbon that won’t break the bank depending on where you live. Found a $34 bottle at a BevMo in the Bay Area and was ecstatic considering in Los Angeles this bottle is usually over $50. If you can’t buy Pappy get Weller. The Antique is my fav.

3.0,"Well, here we go. One of the more controversial whiskies because of the name it carries. The bottle comes up and people love it or you hate it... in my area, a 750ml bottle sells for $89 but found a store that sold a 1L for 30 less than that. So I decided, why the heck not. Initial neck pour so I’ll revisit this. 

But back to the drink.

Nose: it has a really bright sharp fruity cherry smell, vanilla, it’s lighter nose than most bourbons I’ve had. Light orange peel. Butterscotch. 

Taste: the initial flavor is a piney, new oak flavor. You get this sweet, dark cherry flavor in the mid that doesn’t last very long. It last about as long as the sweet in dark chocolate. In the finish, you get a mouthful of tobacco flavor smoke/ spice at the end. 

Mouthfeel: the liquid itself is more watery than oily, the heat is a bit surprising considering how most people call it weak. The residual heat feels like I’ve taken a mouthful of cigar smoke and blown it out. I can really appreciate that. 

Overall this dram was alright. Nothing I was blown away by. Something I would put on my “daily bourbon” list, but definitely not at the price I got it at. I’d rather eagle rare or buffalo Trace for less."

4.5,"Neat.  Open a few months.  Been a long time since I drank Special Reserve.  Used to be my daily since we are spoiled in Ohio.  Really digging this nose tonight.  Sweet oak dipped in charred caramel and a little vanilla.  Nice bread note.  This is a perfect nose to me for a daily quality bourbon.

Thin on the tongue with some initial brown sugar sweetness.  Transitions to all caramel.  Caramel on caramel.  Legs end with a hint of vanilla and the oak.  

You know, shame on me.  I stopped drinking this as my choices expanded and I forgot how much I liked this.  This has to be my favorite pour around the $25 range.  Everything about it is pleasant and makes me smile without making me think.  That’s a perfect daily."

Nose - honey, leather and sweet with a slight bitterness.

Taste - sweet and honey start and the honey keeps on through most of the drink. Crisp and dry at the end with a nutty taste. Ever so slight heat towards the end.

Overall and value - this is another one of those weird availability bourbons. Retail price is supposed to be under $30, however availability and secondary prices sometimes drive this one way up. I wish this was easier to find in my area as it is such a great drinker. For this bourbon to be the beginner of their series, I look forward to trying what else the Weller series has to offer"

Not overly complex, but on value and pleasure it's great.  Soft caramel and vanilla present both in aroma and flavor.  Buttery feel and flavor linger.  Lots of sweet corn, if not corn flake notes.
