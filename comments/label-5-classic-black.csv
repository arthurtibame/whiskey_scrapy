1.0,"Nose: Ethanol, vague ""whisky"" aromas, but nothing of any great character. A little malt, a whiff of vanilla and some green apple.

Palate: A hot arrival without any outstanding flavour (heat but little spice). There's not much development to speak of but some cereal and burnt citrus emerges. It is, thankfully, not burdened by the tannic baggage carried by many bottom-shelf blends.

Finish: Short. A little fruity hint but there's a bitter heat on the aftertaste.

The nose has the unmistakable aroma of bulk grain whisky - ethanol, tired old cask, hard cereal and a slightly rubbery note. This is apparently sourced from the Starlaw grain distillery at Bathgate (about half way between Edinburgh and Glasgow).  I'd also wager that there is a heck of a lot of it in here, as the malt content (apparently largely Glen Moray) seems pretty low.

On the whole this reminds me of several other bottom-shelf blends, and like its kin it can't be recommended for sipping. This is a mixing whisky, pure and simple, so pour in some cola and enjoy (I could not finish my tasting dram of this neat, but as a mixer with soft drinks it's fine - a little more vanilla even manages to peep through).

I'm rating this pretty low because it's not the cheapest bottom-shelf whisky and arguably one of the least impressive, and if you're on a tight budget the quality/price ratio really matters. You can find Bells for $5 less in many shops, and it's way better. For $5 more Famous Grouse stomps it into the ground.

""Inferior"" : 1 star."

4.0,It's a great choice considering it's price it has a smooth taste with very strong effect but it does not have much to offer in terms of richness
2.5,"I truly believe this is not a bad whisky for its price. The score might make you think otherwise but here in Ecuador is only $7, so the competition against other cheap whiskies is good for them since it is not a bad dram compared to others.

Bottled at 40%abv 

On the nose: Lemon, Vanilla, Dry cake, Alcohol note, Prunes ,Lots of cream.

On the palate: Creamy very creamy, lots of grain whisky. Oak burn, vanilla and oak.

Finish short. A little burn with a clove finish. 

Overall i give this one a 57 over 100."
