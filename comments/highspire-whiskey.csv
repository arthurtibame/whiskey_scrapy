2.5,better than I expected.
2.0,"A little rough. Nose is play dough, with a whiff a spice and vanilla. Palate is largely the same, with more rye spice poking through. Finish is surprisingly smooth, but short.

This whiskey is finished with oak staves, giving it the thin veneer of age, without the mellowing or complexity that real aging brings. Might find a home in cocktails, but not as a neat sipper."
