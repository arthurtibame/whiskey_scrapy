4.25,"This is the second time I have tried a Bunnahabhain finished in casks that once held fortified Marasla wine, but whereas the previous one was bottled after 13 years this one was distilled 30 years before it was put into glass, back in the era of the Thatcher government. The younger version was a peated malt that I rated 4.0 and good value at its original price of $80. This version is unpeated and will set you back 450 pounds a bottle, a price that has meant you can still order one from the distillery despite an outturn of only 1,260 bottles. My share from a bottle split yielded a pour with a lovely musty nose containing aromas of white grapes and cola. It’s sweet and oily on first sip, with dried apricots making an appearance amid the flavors, just as they did in the younger version. There’s a long, dry finish rich in tannins and a nice funky aftertaste. Very good, but not a patch on the whisky I will discuss for tasting #500: Johnnie Walker Red Label."
