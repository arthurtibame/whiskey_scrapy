2.0,Harsh to me. Prefer a smoother finish.
2.75,Has a interesting nose that makes you question whether this is a rye. Flavor tastes very young and retains a sharp raw alcohol taste. Definitely a tad bit of sweetness on the finish and a warm mouth feel.
5.0,"What a great name for a Rye Whiskey! Catcher in the Rye is one of my favourite books and the subtle hints all over the label to the book is impressive. 

- The nose is bright with sweetness and hints of green, almost dill in tone.
- On the palate it hints you with the traditional rye whiskey spice, given its 100% rye.
- It then balances out that sharp spice with a beautiful honey sweetness.

Additional notes from the distillery: 
- (March 2020) Now aged for 5 years in 53 gallon New American Oak Barrels, up from 2 years of original release."

2.5,"Nose is a bit sweet, seems floral.  Nice heat on initial sip, def get the floral after taste.  New to the Ryes but this one doesn’t compete with what I have tasted prior."
