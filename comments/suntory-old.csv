3.5,"Aroma: pleasantly aromatic, perfume like, moderate floral note of maybe rose and/or carnations, darker fruit notes, dried fruits, berry, possibly a sherry note, lightest hint of honey and a buttery note. Taste: sweetness of dark sugar and with a fruity quality, peppery spicy note (white pepper?) comes through next and strong, oak spices, mild herbal grassy note, a possibly a hint of a peaty note on the finish. Spicy notes linger on the finish. Very much scotch like. I would imagine this is a blend, but for a mid level budget Japanese whisky, this is quite good. Well done for the price. One worth checking out on the Japanese whisky trail if you can find it."

4.5,"Sherry aroma. Deep dark flavors. Tastes like some sort of darker fruit, like charries or plums. Perhaps it has a Sherry finish.  The sweet leads into a tail that tastes to me medicinal? Deep, rich, and sweet. Honey there too, points for tasting original. great price too."
2.75,"Nose: Slight alcohol bite, green bananas, grain, sweet and floral
Mouth: Sweet caramel
Finish: Short, sweet, some light tannins, alcohol"
4.25,"Complex, oaky, dark brown sugars, some astringency.  Not harsh but I wouldn't call it smooth.  Interesting"
2.25,"By trying to recollect my memories of this whisky the first thing that appears in my mind is that I described it as a sweeter and a more intense version of the classic blended scotches (Red label, Ballantine’s - the cheapest ones).
Strong spiritous and caramel sweet aroma, some citrus obviously.
The taste is sweet with caramel and vanilla hints. 
Nothing remarkable at all, unfortunately."
