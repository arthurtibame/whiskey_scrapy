2.5,"A light scotch, sharp to the taste and not terribly complex on the surface.  Once it opens, there are some herbal notes but still lacking in any striking qualities."

3.0,"The nose begins soft & savory with vanilla/apricot notes, giving way to a sharper tang of teriyaki glaze. Creamy brown sugar on the palate, heating up to a spicy nutmeg finish. It's a bit odd, to be honest. A bit funky. My least favorite of the Bruichladdich expressions I've tried."

4.0,Stone dry and mineral taste. Not very sweet. A bit sour but not citrusy. Grassy green smell but no peat. Light smoke. Smooth oily mouth feel. Thumbs up. Like to pair with medium bodied cigar

4.0,"I am so upset that they stopped producing the Laddie 10. This was by far one of the best, keep in the house for a few friends Scotch's there was. Smooth with a hint of peat; just a hint, silky and worth sipping very slow."

5.0,"The nose has powerful herbs, dry vegetation, subtle citrus, salt, and a fruity sweetness that hides from everything else. The palate is an evolving chameleon creature of mouth watering Islay maritime favors, plus citrus, that begins as crisp and biting. With time in the glass it becomes mellowed and fruity,  but never loses any flavors. Holy smokes! Why have I wasted so much time in waiting to try this stuff?"

5.0,"Nose: Honey and tropical fruits rise delightfully. Lemon dominates with peaches and apricot on the background. Drop of water joins delicate aromas of oak, vanilla and nuts.

Taste: Sweet oak and honey start the show. There is a sherry feel but it's delicate. A great combination of spices and sugary fruits develop with time. Rich and complex.

Finish: Malted barley with wee oil and some earthly touch. Also bitter notes. Smooth and long finish.

Balance: Magnificent whisky with great complexity. Smooth and versatile dram with character. Subtle aromas and great taste. Has to be one of the best 10YOs out there."

2.0,I was a little disappointed. perhaps because I had the sixteen before I had the ten. id take the sixteen over it any day. lacked the depth and complexity of what I have come to expect from bruichladdich. maybe just a bad dram.

3.0,Really benefits from a good glug of oxygen before re-corking and coming back to it a few days later. Dramatically reduces the eurghh factor and transforms your snifter to more of an arhhh. Perfect for a whisky Wednesday slurp.

null,"Not smoke per se but I get a strong sweet bacon in the nose and early palate, which I love and also find in the octomore 6.1. Surprised how much I like this. Some say the laddie classic is better?"

5.0,"On first opening the bottle, I was met by an off note. Something like buttermilk gone sour. Upon leaving the whisky in the glass for a while, this note disappeared and I found myself enjoying this whisky. In fact, I loved it. Creamy, sweet and complex. Can be drunk both as an easy-drinkinking evening whisky, but provides ample opportunity for nerds to geek out. Fantastic stuff, shame it is no more."

4.0,"NOSE  – Honey, hint of Vanilla, Briny like the ocean air
            
            BODY – white pepper, barley, briny, red licorice, hay, velvety
              
            FINISH – long, honey, light smoke at the very end
              
            OVERALL – A consistent product throughout! It's not the most complex scotch (this does't mean it's simple, however),  but it does what it sets out to do very well. The nose could be the definition of what to expect in a ""classic"" scotch. Absolutely wonderful! It made me want to keep coming back for another glass."
