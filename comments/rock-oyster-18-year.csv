4.0,"Lovely dram, very subtle on the smoke. Peach, orange and more going on. Doesn't need any water to open up. I had to strain a bit to get what was in there out but was worth it. Nice blending effort."
5.0,"Faint smoke, but sharp and succulent peat on the palate.
powdered hard licorice candies
fresh sour apples
pronounced bitterness, bitter oranges
blood oranges, peaches, pineapples, grapefruit, pomegranate
bananas, banana peels
green pepper, black pepper
honey and treacle
marzipan
Medium dark chocolate, coffee, cocoa powder, dusty, gets very rich and chocolaty
that un-chill filtered frozen yogurt note
bit of waxy malt
Salty and has kind of a fresh mineral-y sea air presence -

Half a teaspoon of water, give it half an hour to really bring the age out. Tremendous age.

Does a flip - turns itself completely inside-out about three weeks in. Goes from sharp and zingy to birthday cake: milk chocolate, whipped cream, huge yellow fruit. Very full and soft.

One of the most outstanding and delicious malts I have ever tasted. Very well vatted."
