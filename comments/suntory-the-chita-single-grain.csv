4.0,"This whisky makes up a large portion of Hibiki. If you like the sweetness and smoothness of Hibiki, this is your whisky.
    
    The Chita is...the cheetah.
    
   It has a nice golden honey color.
    
  This one starts stalking and you nose acetone followed by caramel and vanilla, then some citrus fruits (lemon and mango) and some sweet corn.
    
  The taste sprints  into the extremely smooth, crisp gallop of lots of caramel and vanilla, lots of sweetness, mid run alcohol burn and then back to the fresh citrus. 
    
Then the moderately quick kill; the reality of what you’ve witnessed sets in with some slight drying tannins and as you would expect from a cheetah, quickly disappears in a trail of bitter lemon, caramel, and sweetness."

Some grain notes and a bit of banana split, then a light bitterness at the end. Won't blow you away or occupy you with complexity, but still seems like a quality pour. 2/6/17"

3.0,"This is like a Japanese take on bourbon. The nose is sweet, light and refreshing, with some fruity and vanilla notes. The palate is light as well with cereal notes being the most prominent, accompanied by vanilla and a bit of fruit such as peach and banana. The finish is short but it fits well with this light whisky. There is no spice or smoke what so ever, and I can see many non whisky drinkers enjoying this. It goes quite well on the rocks and I can definitely see this as a picnic drink or as a staple on a hot summer day."

3.0,"Japanese whisky tasting evening, Sydney 28 March 18, Whisky #2

  Nose: Sweetly fragrant light citrus, faint melon, soft incense wood, vanilla, very mild oak.

  Palate: A soft velvety arrival, smooth and creamy with honeyed notes. As it develops a little ginger, vanilla and mild spice emerges. Reminiscent of a freshly-baked and very lightly spiced sponge cake. Good texture.

  Finish: Short. Cereal and light wood flavours, a touch of spicy bitterness in the end.

  An agreeable single grain with no particular flaws but in the end it's a bit lacking in character. Almost totally spirit driven apart from the floral fragrant note and spices from the casks. Hard to dislike, but there are better whiskies.

Adding a dash of water causes it to become over-spicy and lose the fragrant note, and worse it loses its creamy mouth-feel. This is an issue because the texture of this whisky is at least half its charm, so I'd recommend taking it neat. The official score here seems too generous.

""Above Average"" : 3 stars"

3.5,"The Chita is Suntory’s single grain offering. This is part of the trilogy of Yamazaki, Hakushu & Chita that are the primary components of almost all Suntory blends, minus what they buy in from abroad - yes they do - it only has to be landed here for a while for it to be called “Japanese whisky”, so caveat emptor where “new” Japanese whiskies, and my goodness there have been a few recently, are concerned. The Chita is sweet and simple, a lovely grain (corn) whisky with vanilla, some floral notes, sandalwood and some tannins from the wood. Delicious, and the only one of the trilogy still readily available here in Japan since the world went ape**** for Japanese whisky. Bastards, so you are!

The aroma comes more from the fruity side, with a hint of banana, somehow pineapple.Chita may not ideal for those are not fancy of over-honey taste. But it is totally not true.Add a few drops of water to the glass to open up more flavours and aroma of the drink. You will be surprised that you are tasting a totally different Chita. Or simply keep the whisky in your mouth a little bit longer. The bittersweetness then slowly spreads over the palate. The bitter may come from ginger and citrus. However, the finish will be short but the sweetness will come slowly."
