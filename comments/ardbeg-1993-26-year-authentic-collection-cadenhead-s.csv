5.0,"Let’s talk about baby vomit. It’s the term often used for a sour cream aroma sometimes found in whisky, most notably Bruichladdich. It’s caused by butyric acid, a result of bacteria that form during extended fermentation times. It’s never a good idea to have too much of this in your distillate, but in small quantities many people find it a desirable (if divisive) flavor. In general I’m a fan of funky unusual notes in whisky so I really enjoyed my first experience of it in an Ardbeg, courtesy of this just released bourbon cask bottling from Cadenhead. The slightly sour aroma mingles with full-fat cream and a blast of eucalyptus nasal inhaler on the nose. The peat hits you on first sip before it turns very creamy, like a vanilla sponge birthday cake with  smouldering candles. The embers linger on the finish. This is exactly what you want from an independent bottling: something that is distinctly of the distillery yet a little left-field of an official release. This baby lights my fire."
