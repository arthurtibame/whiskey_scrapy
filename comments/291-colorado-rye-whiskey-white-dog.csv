3.0,"Appearance: This new make (technically whiskey) is clean and clear as filtered water with very thin and viscous legs.

Nose: The nose is funky. It’s tequilaesque, with notes of eucalyptus, pineapple, lemon, overripe watermelon, and what I will call “sour vegetation;” the note is almost like arugula lettuce when let grown too long.

Taste: The palate is a bit harsh. Notes I gather are red apple, bitter chocolate, lemon, and (so sorry for this) that back of the throat taste after you throw up. I will say though the taste becomes much more friendly when paired with a nice cigar.

Finish: A long almost minty finish transitions in this whiskey from after that bitter sick note.

Thoughts: So this whiskey is aged in barrels for two weeks then bottled, allowing it a “Rye” title. It’s a funky journey that is a conversation piece for sure. Distillery 291 uses this whiskey as a substitute for tequila in their bar, and it does a good job. For a mixer I would definitely recommend it! 291 team, thanks for everything! Cheers!"
