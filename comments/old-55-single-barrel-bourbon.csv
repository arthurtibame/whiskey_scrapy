4.0,ABV 55.3 Lots of variety and depth. A favorite for me.
1.5,"To quote a former US president:

“There's an old saying in Tennessee — I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee — that says, fool me once, shame on — shame on you. Fool me — you can't get fooled again.”

By the gods, I wish this saying were true.

After overpaying for this bottle once, at the behest of a local liquor store (they did a store pick on this), I gave this one a second shot. And I was fooled again. Now, to its credit, this is one of the best whiskeys produced by Journeyman. Wait, what? This isn’t Journeyman? It has that same paint-thinner favor profile. Are you sure?

Nose is promising. Sugary sweet. Bit of caramel.

Body is the first hit of that undesirable flavor. It must be a barrel sourcing/water sourcing issue. Never had anything like this from Kentucky. Everything from Journeyman has it. Now this does too. Honestly, paint thinner really is the best way to describe it. I can’t get past it.

Finish is a bit of reprieve from it. It’s still there, but I also get cinnamon and pepper.

Dear people of Indiana: why do you like this crap? And by this crap I mean this and also all Journeyman bourbon and rye whiskey.

Dear bourbon distillers north of Indianapolis: wtf are you doing? Htf are you getting that flavor? Ffs, please stop.

Now for the good: this store pick is LEAGUES better than the first bottle I bought. That bottle was basically undrinkable. I intend to use it to degrease an engine this fall. Maybe remove some painted lines from the CVS parking lot, just to screw with them. Unlike that bottle, this bottle will probably be consumed at some point. However, I will never, ever, ever buy an Old 55 bottle again. And there are very few bourbons to date that have made me say that. As G-Dubs said, “You can’t get fooled again.” Let’s just pretend he meant time #3."
