3.0,"NAS, combining sherry and bourbon casks. Spicy ginger and more sweet and toffee after let it rest for 15mins.  (Like the old logo better)."

2.0,Sad to say I’m disappointed
4.0,"""The best kept secret in Scotland"" is the slogan for this distillery owned by Pernod Ricard and i had the chance to try four expressions of this whisky. This one is special because it has been matured in three types of different casks: hogsheads, Oloroso Sherry and Bourbon barrels.

Bottled at 40%abv

On the nose: Peaches, Floral. Very perfumed. There is some citrus like lime. Dryness appears. Fruitcake. 

On the palate it is very gentle but i could only identify two clean notes: almonds and red apples. Aftertaste is also very clean, tobacco, dry grass and hay. 

Overall it is a good, balanced everyday dram. It goes for $60. My score for it is 82/100"
2.75,"Malt, floral honey, vanilla, caramel, slightly savoury vegetal maltiness, cognac, chocolate raisins. Smooth, spicy, sweet honey flavours lingering, slight mustiness. Slightly thin for the price."

3.75,"Sweet nose. (Brown sugar). Citrus with honey, pear-apple notes.  Finish with a classic taste of scotch. (Iodine, Sherry, with a bit of floral)    Had profile similar to Dalmore.  A little bit of water a must."
4.5,First drink in Italy
4.25,It sweet almost good as Dalmor would drink again
