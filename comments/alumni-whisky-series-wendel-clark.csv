4.5,"I am a big rye fan. I have a storage locker full of Dissertation, which is my all-time favorite Canadian.  Dissertation is also 11 years old and costs $65 a bottle, but it is no longer available. Wendel Clark is 11 years old and sells for $45 a bottle.  Considering the difference in price, I think that this is an exceptional whisky.  The distilling process and the casks used have resulted in a delicious whisky that I plan on buying for future pleasure.  Don does it again!"

4.0,"This is just beautiful stuff. Currently my favourite rye, even above Lot 40 on my list.

Nose is rich with rye and caramel. There are some layers there I can't even process. 

Taste is superb. Deep, rich, fruity, spicy, floral.

For $45, this is an easy buy and buy again."

4.0,"The Wendel Clark edition is a blend of double column distilled rye and pot still distilled rye (I think), aged for 11 years in ex-bourbon barrels. This is bottled at 41.6 % abv, in honour of the Toronto's area code, where Wendel Clark spent the majority of his career.

Tasting Notes

* Nose (undiluted): rye spice, toffee, red apples, oak, vanilla
* Palate (undiluted): rich and round, toffee sweetness, clementine oranges, a little bit of coconut giving way to peppery cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon
* Finish: medium length, Kraft soft caramels, chai tea, with the taste of coconut macaroons lingering.

With the addition of water, there's more red apple on the nose, more spice on the palate, and a pleasant hit of fresh cigar on the finish. I was loath to add water to a whisky bottled at 41.6% abv, but water really opens it up nicely. A few scant drops will suffice. This whisky is delicious either way. When I first opened the bottle, I found it very similar to Lot no.40, but it changed with some air exposure. Lot 40 has a wider spectrum of flavours, and is more oak-driven in general, but this whisky is much more than a marketing gimmick. It delivers the goods in a big way. Recommended. 88/100 points"
