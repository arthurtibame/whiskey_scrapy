3.0,"Old oak color. Reminds me of the color of a lot of old sherries. on the nose honey dried cherries and dried apples, chocolate. Sherry flavors pop on the tongue. absolutely feel the oiliness and astringency that the reviewer found. Medium dried apples finish . Overall not as much fun as the nine year"
3.0,"Baking spices and cinnamon, apples, some caramel. Hot on the tongue, but not tingling, actually still smooth in a way. Some bitterness, but in a burnt sugar kind of way. Interesting, but not as unique or weird as I was expecting. Medium finish. With ice, opens up a bit, an additional peanut note. 8/10/17"

4.0,Rips your face off on the nose with hints of apricot and peach. Added a drop of limestone water and instantly got an apple taste on the mouth. Consistent burn on the finish.
