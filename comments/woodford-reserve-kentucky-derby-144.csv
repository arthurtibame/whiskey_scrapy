3.75,My least favorite of the Woodford Reserves I have tasted. To me this version has a bourbon + scotch taste to it.

3.0,"The palate is certainly nice. I get notes of vanilla poking through the spice of rye and some wood as well. Tingles the tongue, with the faintest hint of a dark chocolate enveloping. The finish is unineresting, everything becomes muted except the eye. On the nose and the the very first taste, I get the corn's sweetness, with a good dash of bitterness as well. These flavors lead way to the dark chocolate and meld with rye before entirely vanishing."
