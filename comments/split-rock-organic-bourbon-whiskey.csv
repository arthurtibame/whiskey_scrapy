2.75,"I was introduced to Split Rock Distilling last fall at a food and spirits expo in Portland Maine.  My conversation with the two founders of Split Rock, Matt and Topher, was the highlight of the day.  They were super friendly, but also seriously committed to their craft.  As soon as they learned I was a whiskey enthusiast, they started passionately describing their products.  Among other things, I got a good lesson in the art of small barrel aging.

I was very excited to try the organic four-grain (60% corn, 20% wheat, 15% barley, and 5% percent rye) bourbon, and it was a winner.  Each of the grains brought some distinct and discernable qualities to the show - vanilla and caramel from the corn and wheat, some cereal grain from the barley, and a nice little hit of baking spice on the finish from the rye.  It was all integrated into a solid package from the nose to finish.  Matt and Topher got high-fives.

I bought a bottle and opened it about a week later, mentally preparing a glowing Distiller review as I was pulling out the cork.  But tragedy struck.  The taste was vastly different - the palate was dominated by a vegetal maltiness.  I set the bottle aside and revisited it several times since, but no change.  It's certainly not awful, but not great either.  And oddly, the closest comparisons I can think of are two American single malts - Swift and Virginia Distillery, neither of which I'm highly enamored with.  It's baffling to me that a whiskey with 15% barley tastes like it's 100% barley. 

It took five months to get around to writing this review because it took me this long to come to terms with it.  Perhaps I was a bit traumatized.  But despite the disappointment, I'm not going to give up on these guys.  They have just released two straight bourbons (aged three years in somewhat larger barrels, available at 88 proof and cask strength).  When I get the time, I'll be making a trip to the distillery."

4.25,"Very smoky, smooth"
3.75,"Bourbon club
Bit smokier than I was expecting- skin to scotch"
2.5,Nose and initial taste impression made me think scotch not bourbon.  Grassy.  Not particularly full bodied.
