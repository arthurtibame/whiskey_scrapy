2.5,"A lot of flavor, and surprisingly smooth, for such an inexpensive whiskey,"
2.0,"Appearance: This Canadian blend had thick watery legs and an orange copper color.

Nose: The nose, no surprise, was quite sweet. Notes of carmel, maple syrup, cotton candy dominate, while wildflowers, honey, ripe red apple and peach round out the rest of the nose.

Taste: The palate, unfortunately, despite the more honest proof, was pretty bland. There was a peppery rye spice, with notes of ripe strawberry, light vanilla latte, and cheap coffee and creamer.

Finish: It was a shorter length finish that started with a light peppery burn.

Thoughts: There was no doubt this was a Canadian blended whisky; it had all the typical characteristics. But this bottom shelfer just didn’t quite cut it for me. As a budget higher proof option, this may be a good option, but overall, I wasn’t too impressed. Sorry, Hunter. Cheers!"
