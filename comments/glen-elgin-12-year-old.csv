3.0,"Nose: Floral notes mixed with honey and hints of toffee on the side.

Taste: Difficult character. Smooth with caramel and fruity sweetness with oranges as the main character. Yet it's spicy and dry with even hints of smoke(?)...

Finish: Oil and spices finalize the medium lasting finish.

Balance: Not very balanced. Tricky and difficult, left me confused. Glen Elgin 12 yrs would need some more exploring, one whisky tasting sample simply isn't enough for me to understand this dram."

4.25,"Strong sweet fruit and oak aroma. 
Smells complex
Bright fruity flavor, followed by a big wood kick with plenty of burn. Fruit is maybe lemon or banana? The alcohol kick is big and is only medium rich despite the age."

4.0,"First off thanks to Cascdoe for a sample of this....I like this one! The nose is complex and also amazing. Floral notes, lemon and honey...there are more layers to peel back. This is a full tasting dram....sweet malt but balanced with oak...toasted oak. Touch of spice and oak tannin on the finish but all balanced beautifully. Like the nose this has many layers.....what a great dram! 4 stars or 94.....I need to expand on this review when I have a bottle."

3.0,"Good whisky and quite complex. The nose has faint hints of pear and is mostly floral, with a predominance of wet hay (almost like wet dog fur) and a nice dose of barley. The palate is mostly spicy (but not cinnamon) with some almond. The finish is a return to fruitiness, mostly pear again, and is quite long. Cheers!"
4.0,"Nose: Malty with herbaceous and floral honey notes, like Tasmanian leatherwood honey. Citrus hints and even a little briny character. There is also a delightfully rich aroma of top quality oak casks. In fact, that's the nose in essence - quality floral honey and quality oak. Yummy!

Palate: Smooth and sweet, but not sickly sweet, with light honey and cereal coming to the fore later. A very friendly buttery chocolate and cream quality.

Finish: Medium. Chocolate, malt, oatcakes and a little mild spice.

A delicious hidden gem.  When first opened the sweet palate makes this almost dangerously drinkable, but with some oxidization the initial floral honey sweetness veers towards a more subtle and elegant spicy sweetness, which is most pleasant.

It would be just another floral, fruity whisky were it not for the full, meaty character that is underpinning everything. Not a hint of peat, but a delicate background whiff of barrel-char and some masterful cask maturation.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

4.0,"Moderate flavor of Speyside. Light wood, a bit of spice."
3.0,"The nose on this guy brings pears, apples, vanilla, cream, and some blended spices. The palate is hot for 40% ABV. I can taste the elements of the bourbon cask, royal icing, grassy notes come through, savory pastry, sour dough, peaches and finally herbal notes. Complex to me for a 12 year old, and seems to be well-rounded. The finish brings in more shortbread cookies, almonds, but was a little short. I actually liked this one guys, so I will give it a 3.5. Thanks so much for @Scott_E for the chance to experience this one. The theme to this one is going to be ""Amorphous Surprise"" by Guided by Voices."

I’ve been dragging my feet this round,  I’m one of those “special” kids in the back this round, that need the extra help and tutoring.  This is courtesy of @Scott_E as part of our trading team.  Round 6 of 7.  Quick hit review:  you can do better.  Spend the $45 elesewhere..."

3.0,"Friday. I always look forward to Friday and my weekend pour.  This pour is another from our sixth round for our Scottish Whisky tour group.  This one is uncommon to the States and to me.
  
  Fruit and sweetness begin to open on the nose. Diced pears and apples, blueberries with caramel and vanilla. Some cake and sugar icing come through over time.  A small amount of cinnamon and nutmeg spice deep down in the bowels of the nose but takes patience to discover it. 
  
  The lightweight body delivers a sweet with an spicy oakiness.  Honey, caramel, vanilla provide the sweetness.  The spicy quality provides black pepper and cinnamon (red hot) heat, but not overbearing, with some char.  The body is
  
  The finish is oaky, long and drying with a touch of sootiness. 
  
  The whisky starts wonderfully sweet and slightly complex but the palate is not as rewarding as the nose and somewhat average on the finish.  However, this is a decent whisky that is sippable, enjoyable.  It won’t blow your doors off, but, as well, you won’t want to turn it down. [$46][85/100][Tasted: 6/15/18]"
3.0,"It’s back to sampling pours from the distillery tour group.  Next up:  Glen Elgin 12.  Glen Elgin is a Speyside distillery that originally opened in 1898.  They are primarily supplying malts for White Horse blends, which I’m not sure are even available here in the states.  They only single malt they bottle is the 12 year and it also isn’t available stateside.  It’s a deep amber and gold color and makes very few legs.  It’s bottled at 43%.

The nose is predominantly honey and sherry sweetness with banana and biscuit flavors mingling throughout.  There’s a light oak spice present, as well.  The palate was more spicy, with almonds and sherry notes.  There was a slight hint of tea leaves and biscuits again.  The mouthfeel was oily and thick.  The finish is medium length and malt heavy.  There’s a heavy spice and oak hit at the very end.

Overall, it’s a solid offering but it doesn’t offer anything exciting over many readily available Speyside sherry cask bottles.  Thanks to @Scott_E for the pour.  I’d say this one is easily crushable and enjoyable.  3.5 stars.  Cheers."

In an attempt to expand the whiskey footprint outside of the bourbon world, here we go: 

Nose =   Fruity, Cereal, “Figgy” Spices
Palate =  Honey & Spice, slightly oaky on the finish."

3.0,"Stop number 82 on the SDT is Glen Elgin. This is a little known Diageo owned Speyside distillery. I’m sure the majority of their production goes into blends but alas Wikipedia did not have this info and I didn’t bother to look any further. I’m not sure if this bottle is available in the USA because this bottle was ordered via Master of Malt by fellow tour member @Scott_E. It’s bottled at 43% ABV and being a Diageo brand I’m sure it’s colored, a yellow gold in this case, and it’s chill filtered. 

The nose is very sweet with blackberry jam, raspberries, orange or tangerine marmalade. Honey, malty/buttery biscuits and blueberry muffins. Crisp green apples, slightly floral, earthy and vegetal. A few drops of water brings out more honey with some vanilla and cherries. Not a bad nose at all. 

The palate unfortunately veers away as if it were driving on the road and a deer jumped out in from the car. Berry notes at first, followed by cough syrup, bitter oak, very bitter dark chocolate and bitter almonds. A little spicy and there seems to be some very underripe pineapple. Water washes out the spice and brings out a soapy note and strong floral qualities. 

A light bodied mouthfeel. A bit thin but mouthwatering. 
A medium length finish...bitter, bitter, bitter. Cough syrup, oak, fruits, a touch of florals and almonds. 

The nose here started off so promising and never really had any problems other than maybe being a little on the light side. The palate and finish really were a disappointment. Almost none of the nose translated and the bitterness was overwhelming at times. At $46 before international shipping it’s not a terrible price, but still not one I would want to pay. Based on the nose alone I would have given at least a 3.5, based on the palate and finish it would have been at most a 2.5. So let’s call this an even 3. 
Cheers"

3.0,"Interesting drop. Viscous honey, vanilla, there is also a sulfuric meaty herbalness going on. I do like mortlach, craigallechie etc with the same surpheric, meaty flavour profile but what they don't have is that excessive lemony bitterness which comes along for the ride. The 26 year Glen Elgin Signatory I preferred which I gave a 3.75. 3 - 3.25 I'm thinking for this one."
