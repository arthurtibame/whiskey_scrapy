3.25,"The nose has a strong woody character, though it isn't overwhelming. There's plenty of clove with also cinnamon and brown sugar. It doesn't have a lot of a sweet smell, but it smells rich. It smells dry and rye without having much mineral smell. The palate is rich without being all that viscous or tremendously smooth. It's fairly fiery with a long slow burn. It's quite dry with some nice barrel flavors coming through - lots of clove and cinnamon here, though it isn't excessively drying. There's brown sugar, but it tastes lighter than expected. This would be better if it were less dry and more robust. It doesn't taste over-oaked and some light red fruit does eventually come through, but there isn't as much happening here as I really hoped there would be. It seems like a lot of the reviewers on Distiller got older, higher proof barrels than mine. The dryness avoids tasting overly mineral like the rye is taking over, in large part because a nice rich dose of vanilla comes through from the long, slow aging. This is not a particularly excellent barrel. A bigger sip reveals some more subtle notes in the wood and spices that weave then together more nicely and bring the vanilla in more. I can even appreciate the balance with the mineral here, but I'd rather take Booker's. I suspect a big part of the problem is that this is such a miserably low barrel proof. It's definitely on the numbing side - the clove comes through."

4.0,"Neat.  Nose is light.  Corn, caramel, a hint of something floral and maybe raisins or dark cherries.  Medium bodied.  Initial taste is cinnamon and sugar on the tongue.  Rye hits the back of the throat and gives way to sweet cereal and dark chocolates.  Hint of mint at the end and on the breath.  It grew on me with every sip.  Enjoyable but not a treat."
