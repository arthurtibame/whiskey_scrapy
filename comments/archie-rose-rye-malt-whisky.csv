3.5,"Australian Single Malt Whisky Tasting (Part 2), The Oak Barrel, Sydney 17 January 2020, Whisky #2

Nose: Sweet and light, perfumed herbal and honeyed apricot notes with fresh oak in the background. Banana bread, very light vanilla/caramel and over time faint caraway and anise aromas develop. The dry glass is extremely faint, with just a ghost of toffee remaining. This is NOT your granddad's rye.

Palate: Soft and sweet with mild baking spice in the arrival. Cinnamon and ginger but not the hot varieties. No heat intensity at all, but a faintly spritzty quality, as of very mild bright spice or near-sherbety citrus as it develops. Vanilla, caramel, mixed dried fruit with citrus peel and cherries. The texture is like a soft cosy blanket.

Finish: Medium. Caraway and dill seed, a hint of brine that fades into a semi-sweet aftertaste.

I've made a new ""generic"" listing for this whisky as although Archie Rose is releasing it in small batches it is a core product and all the batches are effectively the same (I've tasted the 1st batch previously and now the 4th this evening and there is no identifiable difference). 

What is different is the nature of this very interesting whisky. I recall being almost shocked when I first tasted it and it had the same effect tonight. Unless you have access to some very unusual whiskies I can guarantee that this is unlike any rye you have tasted before, and I can also guarantee that some rye enthusiasts will be near outraged by it.

It has virtually no prickle, sharpness or spice but it is far from bland. It's a sweetly elegant rye with no bombast and it is bottled at moderate abv. The mashbill is a deep secret but the creamy, honeyed tones it displays are not due to minimal rye content, but rather the fact that they use malted rye instead of a simple rye mash, which is most unusual.

This is effectively a single malt whisky made with a mixture of Australian La Trobe barley and lightly kilned German rye, and it's delicious.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"
