4.0,"I'd probably give this 4.5 if it was an option. A few tips if you try this: 1) Try it before you drink anything else. The subtleties are easily overlooked if your palate is used to bigger, more grain forward whiskey. And 2) don't go in expecting bourbon. This is a wonderful product but it's nothing like bourbon. The nose is sweet with graham crackers and marshmallows and the palate matches. This is a great summer whiskey and likely one of the most unique products you'll try. 14 year light whiskey just doesn't exist. I would happily by another bottle at $100."
4.0,"I just tried this at the High West distillery in Park City, Utah.   It's really not like one should make a pilmigrage to (like a Macallan),  but if you're in Park City, it's located right in the entrance to the Main St, and a worthwhile visit.  It's a distillery, saloon, and restaurant.  I tried this and the Valley Tan.  Both of which are available only at the distillery.  This is really unique.  It's well aged, but not like a well aged grain.  Instead more like a malt based scotch.  I would not have known it's corn based.  Nose is fragrant vanilla, and palette hits the vanilla with a strong dosing of oak.  Finish is long and lingering.  I bought it for $100----not sure it's worth it that price, considering their Midwinter is $90.  But...heck...I was here, and wanted something I couldn't buy from my local store."

3.0,"Tried this at the High West restaurant. It is LIGHT. Unlike anything I've tried. Coming from their rye my brain was expecting something different so the first couple sips threw me off. Opened up as it went on. Not as much corn taste as you'd expect, which I liked, but I got hints of mint, honey suckle. A bit thin on the mouth feel for me personally.  Worth the tester I tried. Don't think I'll shell out 100$ for it with so many other amazing offerings from high west."

1.0,"I will give this another shot, but for the first time ever, I am disappointed in a High West product. It tastes like vodka that's been ages in a used bourbon barrel for a couple years. Not what I was hoping for when I acquired this bottle..."

4.0,"Nose - Very clean nose, lightly buttered popcorn, subtle vanilla cream, light oak

Taste - Sweet buttery sweet creamed corn, vanilla buttercream frosting, hint of smooth cinnamon spice

Finish - Smooth creamy sweet corn, vanilla cream cheese frosting, background of cinnamon heat.

Score - 85/100

Final Thoughts - I guess I went into this one with relatively low expectations. Since this entered the barrel at a pretty high proof, most of the unique flavors have been mostly distilled/stripped out. This was pretty one dimensional but pleasant throughout. Not exactly something I'd willingly order at a bar or reach for, but if offered a pour, I wouldn't turn it town. Nothing really off-putting but at the same time nothing really exciting about it. I could see this doing very well in a more vanilla/caramel desserty old fashioned."

3.25,Really interesting even if not a true whiskey.  It is very light on the palate and tastes more like a whiskey flavored neutral spirit (which it essentially is) than a robust bourbon.  Good for easing people in to the whiskey experience without the cheap taste of a basic blend.

3.5,"Good nose, with spice and cream. On the palate, rich vanilla and pecan nibs. Some sour fruit. Sweetness is there. The bitterness lingers but it's not too much. Not complex but what's there is quality. 3/3/19"

3.75,"N: sweet corn, caramel, astringent alcohol
P: smooth, slightly oily Werther’s original up front. Sweet cream corn. Like slightly melted butter in its texture. Off brand cinnamon hard candy at the end. 
F: lingering, delicious caramel. Cream. Butter. 

Overall: very one dimensional, get extraordinarily delicious in its sweetness and viscosity in a way that makes you keep coming back. The smoothness and dessert-like quality make it a fantastic pour despite its one dimensional quality 

0-1.5: Disgusting. Worth only mixing or          meeting the drain. 
2: Bad. Drinkable, but majorly flawed 
2.5: Sub-par. OK, but bland or somewhat flawed. 
3: Good. Decent stuff, but I won’t be rushing to buy it 
3.5: Very good. I’d love to keep a bottle around
4: Excellent. I would like to own a case. A go to for me that is worthy of celebrating 
4.5: Incredible.Truly high end, elite level, very noteworthy
5: Sublime. Nearly perfect and an all time favorite"
5.0,so smooth
