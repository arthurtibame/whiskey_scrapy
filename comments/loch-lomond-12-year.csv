4.0,"Nose: Hearty fruits with spices. Some peat smoke. Oaky with hints of vanilla as well.

Palate: Spice stronger on the palate than on the nose. Smokier as well. Smooth and pleasant.

Finish: Medium finish. Lingers a bit and has a very earthy taste. Peat smoke adds a delightful kick, something I absolutely love. 

Overall Thoughts: I’ve had this bottle for quite a while bit I’ve only had one taste before this review. I think it’s a fine whisky and I’d happily gift this to a friend. It’s simplicity is it’s only downfall. It’s definitely not something I’d turn down."

4.0,"Well, this won't be an in depth review, just too tired. Last week of vacation and my wife has been trying to kill me. Oh, she calls it ""home improvement"" but she's not fooling me.  

The nose  of this whisky was confusing. I get a maltiness,  fruit and vanilla that I really like. On the other hand there was a soapy oak undertone that was off-putting. Really bothersome. Once you get to the palate though all that is forgotten. This is good stuff. It is really like a smooth rye whisky, spices (salt, pepper, vanilla and cardemom) and all poured over a bowl of fruit. At the end, on the back of the tongue ther is a HUGE peach burst. I mean just like you bit into a lovely ripe juicy peach. This peach lingers on and on and on.  It also has a nice oily quality and a bit of a warming burn, most likely due to the 46% abv. Not sure I would purchase a bottle, it is 559 SEK ( ~$68 USD) here in Sweden. There are cheaper whiskies available that I like better, such as GlenDronach 12 yo. Still, I will remember that massive burst of peach. 

OK, this was longer than I planned.  guess my Russian gulag gaurd didn't tire me out as much as I thought. :-)"

3.0,"Friday again. Time for a sample.  A Highland graciously provide to our tasting group by @GenerouslyPaul.  Much needed and wanted after a bad head cold and one of those crazy work weeks. 

Nosing reveals unripened honeydew, apple jolly rancher and vanilla extract. Apples, apricots, soap, rubbing alcohol prove to add a bit of an oddity/out of sorts. Some malt and oak.  There’s an odd funk of mineral/earthiness and fruity sweetness that adds to this swirl of aromas. 

Cognac-like on arrival. Wine-y white grape, apricots, toffee, vanilla with a mineral-earthiness.  All this contained in a medium body.  Vanilla sugar sweetness ultimately comes in the mid-palate as it opens. Fresh ginger as is fades towards the finish which it give liveliness to the palate.  As time progresses, the unbalanced profile begins to fall into balance. 

A short finish of oak, ginger spice with a dash of sweet vanilla.

The nose was a oddity, confusing the senses. The palate was somewhat drab but is pulled together/centered around the sweetness but unfortunately that sweetness does not last long; diffusing what was centered around sweetness to a ginger spiciness.  All that said, there are hints of sophistication where this is a slow sipper.  One to take some time with to slow the day down. At least for 1/24th of it.  [85/100][Tasted: 5/4/18]"

4.0,"I’m winding my way towards the end of our trade group’s fifth round of samples.  Up next:  Loch Lomond 12 year.  Loch Lomond is one of the southern-most Highland distilleries in Scotland.  They also produce single malt and single grain whisky.  This single malt is 46%, isn’t chill filtered, but does have added color.  Speaking of color, its a shiny new copper and it makes lots of legs while leaving a lot of droplets when you give it a spin.

On the nose, it’s pretty malty with a healthy dose of vanilla extract.  Some orchard fruits are present along with some hints of oak cask and alcohol.  The palate is relatively similar with a nice bit of peaches coming out more than anything else.  The maltyness leans more towards toffee than simple syrupy.  It’s also relatively creamy.  The finish winds down with more peaches before turning a bit dry.  It’s medium length and the sweetness lingers on until you take another sip.  Solid all the way around.

A big thanks to my buddy @Generously_Paul for adding this one to our friendly little tour.  This was a very enjoyable malt that I wouldn’t mind having more of this one.  Perhaps I’ll search for an older bottle and see how well that one plays out.  3.75 stars.  Cheers, my friends."

3.0,"The nose brought watermelons, lilacs, soapiness, graham crackers, vanilla, along with a little smoke. The palate did not match that though, but a medium mouth coat. Sulfuric tannin, spices, and woody notes came through. The toffee and vanilla finish was short and dry. Well balanced, but not in my wheelhouse. 3.25. The theme to this dram should be ""It's Only Rock and Roll (But I Like It)"" by the Rolling Stones because of all the soap in the video. Classic! Thanks so much for the sample @Generously_Paul!"
4.0,"Stop number 75 on the SDT is Loch Lomond. This Highland distillery is fairly unique in that it produces both single malt and single grain whiskies. They make their own blended scotch under the Loch Lomond label and have two other brands under the Loch Lomond name; Inchmurrin and Inchmoan. It’s a fairly young distillery as well, having been established in 1964. 

This 12 year old is bottled at 46% ABV and is non chill filtered. It seems that there is a generous amount of colorant added making it an amber color. 

Floral at first on the nose with plenty of heather honey. Sweet bourbon oak. Ripe orchard fruits, apricots, peaches, clementines, orange juice, lemon/lime and grilled apricots (yes I said apricots twice but I picked up on two different styles). Vanilla, creamy and a bit nutty - maybe hazelnut or Brazil. Earthy peat and a thread of smoke. The peat is subtle but serves as a much needed layer of complexity. A few tropical notes like pineapple and kiwi come in. Salty with a bit of ginger and a touch of herbs. If you let a small amount sit in the glass long enough, some light syrupy goodness shows itself. 

The palate starts with tangy orange/pineapple juice. Apricots, nectarines and peaches. Tropical notes like coconut, papaya or maybe passion fruit. A nice vanilla buttercream, honey and floral notes. Cardboard, oak, a touch salty and a vague nuttiness. Earthy peat underneath all of it, but not quite smoky. 

Medium bodied mouthfeel that is mouthwatering and mouth coating but turns dry. 
A medium long finish with floral peat, peaches, apricots and pineapple. Dry and the peaty feel lingers on. 

A surprisingly solid dram. A typical Highland single malt made atypical with a respectable amount of peat. Without that peat it would have probably been white noise amongst a cacophony of Highland stridulation. Though there may be better Highland single malts out there, this one does stand out. At $73 it’s a bit overpriced for a 12 year old, but only just. Recommend for those who enjoy a mid level peat with lots of fruits. A solid 4. 
Cheers"

Sample provided by @Generously_Paul as part of our round 5 trading.  Tasted blind, I’d have thought I’m having cognac.  Fruit salad aroma, like that sweetened type that comes in a can.  In a good way.  More sweet fruits on the palette.  Sugared plums, sweetened cherries.  Just a tinge of chalky alkaline st the finish.  One of those where i’ll personally look into getting a bottle at some point.  Great after dinner dessert dram."

It just isn't really prominent for any single flavor category, yet its simplicity make it extremely easy to drink. The 2nd time I had it I recognized smoke that I didn't initially think was there. It's a bit subtle and deceptive because it is so smooth and balanced in other ways. Along with a tinge of smoke are vanilla, caramel, citrus-fruit, and a nice cookie dough flavor. Also, I get much more oil on the finish than the profile here suggests. I'd buy again. Love drinking it."

3.0,"This one seems to be a logical follow-up to Loch Lomond Original single malt. Through the extra maturation it has evolved into something more adorable than its younger brother which is obvious as the changes that whisky had undergone in the barrel led to a better taste and smell.
Although the core of the whisky stays the same, 12 years in oak result in a better balance and the absence of some prominent harsh notes.
To the nose - a light peat, some medicinal notes (which as I believe are transformed from this insecticidal smell of LL Original), again some dampness, alcohol, some varnish and paint and something that I would most likely describe as a slightly burned tires like when the traffic light suddenly turns red and you just quickly hit the brakes and burn your tires. Yeah, like that. Shit description but anyway. What is more important is that the smell is not that shitty.
The taste is pleasant and sweet, peppery, with vanilla notes spiked with peat, a bit of smoke, pine needles, coconut and plum. But in overall it seems pretty heavy and chemical.
The finish is oaky, spirituous and more like sweeted than really sweet."

3.0,"Coming off the back of the NAS original. 
Oh yeah, this one is better with a higher proof and much more flavour both in smell and taste. Mostly in smell.

Nose:
Nice juicy barley 
Background Molasses 
There is a musty... perhaps sweaty note
Cold cooked chicken (sorry never had that one before)
Floral perfume

Arrival:
It is hard to believe this is 46% it is soft
Bees wax
Spice bite with clove, nutmeg, and cinnamon 

Development:
Builds well here and the notes from arrival intensify
kaffir lime
Wood tannins 
Small peat oily coating that drags into the finish

Finish:
Black tea
A little sweet cling 
Popsicle stick woody dry

Huge improvement to the original which speaks to how cask influence affects the personality of the distillery character."
4.25,"Au nez : fort en alcool, sucré et boisé, la poire est assez présente aux côtés d’une note de noisette et d’autres fruits à coque, derrière quoi on aperçoit une note florale, épicée et légèrement médicinale, la tourbe est distinguable mais très discrète
Au palais : salé et très boisé, un bois jeune et sec, sucre roux, une note de fruits rouges et une légère vanille, la tourbe toujours discrète
La finale est profonde, chaude, boisée et un brin métallique 

Note personnelle : 88/100

Tout est appréciable dans ce whisky en plus d’être une entrée très facile pour les non-amateurs de tourbe. L’équilibre est bon, il ne manque pas vraiment de complexité, il est juste peut être un peu trop « brut » et jeune, le même avec 3 ou 6 ans de plus doit être vraiment exquis, affaire à suivre donc..."

Not an easy-to-go-for whisky to me. For sure I'll never serve it to newbies, nor as a dessert dram.
But hey, serve it siding a roast beef, or pulled pork, or a great Tagliata. It'd be wonderful!
Vote is quite high, for I'd love to have it in my cellar and surprise my mates."

3.0,"Nose: Malty, leathery, dark honey, orchard fruits, a whiff of smoke, some caramel, brine and vanilla and even a little cinnamon spiciness. It's a well-balanced, multi-faceted and pleasing nose that orbits a forceful heart of cereal/malt notes, and there's a beeswax presence that is reminiscent of Clynelish. There's also an oaky hint and an almost metallic intrusion, but it's not a deal-breaker.

Palate: An entry that is sweet but forceful, like the sweetness of blackstrap molasses combined with mixed tropical juices. It's a little hot and spicy on the palate, but agreeably so. A very light anise note appears in the development along with some white grape juice, dried peaches, dried apples, and preserved lemon. The texture is on the oily side, but only slightly.

Finish: Medium/long. Malty, cereal and mildly tannic. There is a light lingering aftertaste of oily, sweet lemon thyme and something hot (chilli? white pepper? galangal? stem ginger?). It's good but marred by a very slight sour note in the finale.

The nose is particularly fine and opens out very well given some time in the glass. This is my third tasting after opening the bottle yesterday, and it has developed surprisingly well in just that time. I'll predict right now that this will be very good indeed by the time it's half-way down the bottle.

The palate is enjoyable if you like a full-bodied whisky. If not you could reasonably call it ""hard"". A dash of water amplifies the spicy notes and considerably lengthens the palate.

I enjoyed this and at the price it is fairly positioned. It shares some features with Springbank, Clynelish and Ben Nevis, but it's not in the same league as any of their expressions. Another reliable malt from the rejuvenated Loch Lomond.

""Above Average"" : 3 stars"

3.0,"Even though this whiskey is only 46%, and it's 12 years old, it's quite hot on the palate. I'm currently tasting 1.5 ounces with a full half ounce of water added, and it's been sitting i  an open Glencairn for about half an hour. The heat is finally letting up, and I can get my nose in. Iodine, slightly salty peat smoke. More like table salt than the ocean. Damp earth and leaf litter in the fall. Vanilla, oranges, and iced tea (get that more often in American single malts). It's a little spicy, but in a fruit cake sort of way. A bit of old leather is sitting toward the back as well. The nose is very pleasant. Vanilla and light fruits up front that drifts into baking spices. The spices quickly shift into a nice peaty character. The peat lingers, then transitions into cereal grains that end in a dry cocoa and espresso finish. I get a hint of spice, and some herbal notes throughout (maybe tarragon), but they are a bit hazy for me. Overall, a very pleasant whiskey. The flavors are neither particularly bold nor subtle, but they are there if you are patient with it's fiery heart. And it's such a cheap bottle it's hard to go wrong with it."

4.0,One of my favorite whisky's to drink. Full rounded body with fruity notes and a lovely subtle but noticeable peat at the end.
2.5,"The nose is right. It makes you want to jump right in. The mouth is nice and silky and as times goes on you will get the slight (correct amount) hint of smoke. The finish has way too much spice in it for me. Surely higher than the graph let on. You definitely dont want to put ice on this bad boy, you'd kill it. Other than the spice it's a good drink. Wouldnt pull another $34 out of the pocket though."
2.5,"More interesting on the nose than on the palate. Sweet fruit notes dissipate too quickly to a dry, harsh finish. It promises more that it delivers and lingers in a way that isn’t pleasant. That said, it’s a relatively easy scotch to drink, and at the price it’s possible this could be one to share with friends where others may find joy in what I find to be unfulfilling"

Nose is exotic, mango, red grape and pineapple roasted over a burning pile of autumn leaves. Peachy pine wood and sweet notes of earthy peat. Has a lot going on to pick at. Palate is reminiscent of Bunnahabhain 12 yr which is a massive complement. Deep rich flavors power through with creamy malt, roasted fruits, sweet oak, pine sap and dark roast coffee peat smokiness. Finishes long with lingering coffee, oak, pine, malt and fading peat. This isn't the strong Islay campfire peat smoke, its as I mentioned before more of sweet smoldering burning leaves situation which is very different and unique. Its complex, vibrant and delicious with natural color and non chill filtered at 92pf! At the price I paid its an absolute steal....90/100.........Imo much better than popular entry level 10/12 yr single malts, this carves its own path with excellent depth and balance of fruit, wood and peat"

Palate: Not smooth, but really good! Dark, spicy and fruity (but not sherry-like!): Chocholate-covered marzipan, coffee, ginger, and more orange peels. Everything is covered in a certain ”dirtyness” which gives character (a bit like Old Pulteney).

Finish: Medium-to-long. Coffee, chocholate, and a generic dark fruity/berry-note. Again really good. 

Overall: I would not call it refined nor sophisticated, but it tastes really good and packs a lot of taste. Pity that the nose wasn’t better. I still score it a solid 3.75, being a bit gereous perhaps, but I want to reward that great palate!"
