3.0,"Better than their others, this is interesting but the alcohol is very present and tastes too young."
3.0,"Nose of barley malt and dried grain, slightly sour. Celery and other greens on the palate. Smooth finish with paprika."

1.0,"I had heard good things... and bad things about this whisky. Being from France, I've been able to see whisky rise up in France, Sweden, Wales, Ireland (after a collapse in production) and so I was curious to see what Italy had to offer. So lets start, the nose was delicious, wine cask, a drier feel from the Italian wine, not as round and sweet as French wine cask whisky, and smooth peat, in one word, promising. Upon tasting it... It is watery, young, the grain is weak, not sturdy Breton, not austere but subtle Scottish, not generous French... just dull, lacking in personality, the Marsala starts to be felt, but it's barged out of the way by the peat. A rough Ileach Cask Strength hum of old oak, bourbon, rye and merciless peat tears through, it strikes the wrong chord with the youth of the whisky at hand. Finally, the Italian wine feebly flits through after the peat, dry and peppery, sweet, but the impact is tainted by the bitter peat. Maybe if this whisky is given time to age, we'll see something worth while, but as it stands, it's a mess. I'd recommend Ileach Cask Strength if you are looking for that old cask and peat feel or G. Rozelieures Rare if you want European oak, wine cask and peat, if it's something rough and delicate you want, look at Naguelann Mesk with malted buckwheat and malted barley, just stay clear of this overpriced whisky."

3.5,"Agréable à déguster comme ça, mais s’efface rapidement quand on le compare à d’autres classiques du même prix. Jolie bouteille !"

Serve this one to your enemies."

4.0,"Une belle surprise ! J’avoue avoir été attiré par le design de la bouteille, mais ce qu’elle contient tombe dans ma palette. Un style très “Islay”."

3.75,"The color is a beautiful light amber, very delicate.
The nose you immediately perceive a light peaty smokiness, a sign that the Islay barrels are not just passing through, accompanied by decisive sweet and vinous notes, obviously marsalate. Yellow fruit with a pinch of pepper. The sense of smell is not particularly complex, but pleasant: youth is felt whole.
On the palate alcohol slightly pinches, and the peat smokiness is immediately dominated by the clear influence of Marsala: lots of wine, lots of orange, together with candied fruit, spices (still pepper, with cloves) and, after a bit of wait, return of the herbaceous peat with a hint of minerality. The profile in the mouth is more interesting than the olfactory one, with a greater variety even if it remains not particularly stratified, with the vinous aspect that dominates it. But for a 3 years old it is already a remarkable achievement.
Marsala finish (very) with a touch of citrus, not very long and dry."
