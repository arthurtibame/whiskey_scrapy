4.5,Let it breath for a full bodied aroma. Caremel notes. Slow deep warming finish.
3.5,Actually Knob Creek Twice Barreled Rye.
4.5,You can taste the 120 proof for sure. However once you get past the ‘Kentucky Hug’ you get the typical vanilla and a bit of baked apple with a hint of Carmel. Classic bourbon. Great value for proof and flavor profile. I prefer this over McKenna 10 at a little more than half the price.

Nose smells like a dark rum, super sweet with tropical fruit notes. Deep maple syrup  color. Some burn up front on the tongue, but fades nicely to reveal caramel, black pepper, molasses and baking spices. Long finish warms the mouth with clove spice."
