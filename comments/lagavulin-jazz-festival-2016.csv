3.25,"Yeah I'm really not a fan of the direction away from the rich, oily full bodied 16 yr expression. However saying that the rest which do take that path are still pretty good quality.  This however is a shadow of even the 11yr Nick Offerman and 8 yr. Its rounded to the point of zero identifiable flavour characteristics or identity. My least favourite Lagavullin ever...Avoid."

4.5,Powerful and heart-filling. music starts when it goes down the throat.  Not for long conversation though.
5.0,One of the best festival bottlings from the distillery. It's lusciously and pleasantly balanced between lots of fruit and the signature smoke.
