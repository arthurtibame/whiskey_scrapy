3.0,"This is a summer drinking bourbon. Light, no finish, with strong wine influences. Easy drinker that is very approachable. Would not recommend this for a bourbon enthusiast. Good pick for introducing new people to the category."
4.0,Sweeter than I’m used to in a bourbon. Doesn’t quick smack you in the face like other bourbons would. Really enjoy it. Easy to drink.

3.0,"I found this bourbon on the shelves of my local Kroger and thought I’d give it a shot. Amador Double Barrel is a sourced Kentucky bourbon consisting of barrels aged between 3 and 10 years old that are then finished for 6 months in Napa Valley wine barrels of an undisclosed variety. Bottled at 43.4% ABV, what I assume is a natural color of orange amber and is probably chill filtered. 

The nose has strong corn notes and some alcohol up front. Heavily charred oak and red wine notes that seem to fade in and out. Vanilla, blackberries, red grapes, cinnamon apples. Some typical toffee/caramel notes, stale marshmallows and brown sugar. A slight bubblegum note and some very light florals, lavender maybe. After a while a strong peanut aroma takes over. A fairly weak nose other than the oak and peanuts. 

The palate mimics the nose almost completely. Corn, charred oak and alcohol. Grapes, apple skins, vanilla and red wine. A bit of spice, nothing over the top but just enough to be enjoyable. Cinnamon, clove, a touch harsh though. Peanuts and peanut brittle. 

A medium bodied mouthfeel that is a bit watery, mouth coating and dry. 
The finish is medium length with corn, oak, peanuts, grapes and is dry. 

I have to say that for a $45 bourbon I was expecting much more. The wine influence is minimal and the bourbon is mediocre. It’s easy drinking but for that kind of money I want more complexity in my bourbons. The peanut note took me a while to figure out, but once I did that was all I could focus on and it became distracting. I’d pass on this one again. 3.25
Cheers"
3.0,Interesting quad grain build. Smooth and Chardonnay barrel finish lends a roundness and slight citrus note to the corn. Lingering burn in the finish; probably great for cocktails

2.75,This whiskey isn’t horrible. But for the price I could give you plenty of name drops that are way better. On the nose I get a lot of oats. The palate is dry oatmeal with a finish of sweet wine. When I first opened it I was very disappointed. But after a couple of weeks it did get a little better. I would not buy this again.

3.5,Nose of cherry vanilla and dark fruit with oak and toast/grain. The taste is has grain overtones with strong cherry and milder baking spice flavors. The finish is spicy and oaky and has a medium length.

3.5,"I have exhausted my collection of daily drinker Bourbon's and when over the weekend I was resorting to alternating between Stagg Jr and Blanton's, I knew I had to seek out more reasonable alternative. I hit my local Total Wine and it was pretty slim pickings. I ended with a choice between this, Old Scout 107 and the Traverse City Bourbon (hat tip to @No_Substitute_4_Bourbon as the reason I even considered the Traverse  City). I ended up going with this one due partly to cost and also that I am partial to wine finished Whiskey. On to the tasting!
Upon entry is extremely approachable with an immediate hit of vanilla, brown sugar and buttery raisan bread. The mid pallette has some slight cinnamon and clove notes with a medium oak, vanilla and toasted spice finish. Spice does linger a bit. All in all it's a pretty pleasant pour that I kept coming back to. I do agree with @Generously_Paul in that it's not overly complex, however, it has just enough going on that I do want to come back for more.
Now, when we compare this one to what's out in the market place, it does stand up tall. It's far better than Slaughter House and slightly better than the Straight Edge Bourbon (and cheaper than both as well)! It's very different from the Pritchard Hill Bourbon. It's a better value to be sure but whether it's better is subjective. Pritchard Hill has some more complexity and the finish is all Cabernet. Very dry oak! With that in mind I think this is a great value pick and does well with what it is. It's a decent Kentucky Bourbon with just enough of a cask finishing to make it interesting. Cheers all!"

2.75,Nose is sweet and dusty with hunks of vanilla popping up here and there. Taste is straight Caramel with a hint of iodine on the finish. A little too sweet with too thin and pasty of a finish to be particularly pleasant.

2.0,"This is in the port-finish/other-finish division of my finished bourbon bracket. Quick recap of the blind taste tests so far:

Joseph Magnus, Noble Oak, Wild Turkey Revival, Rabbit Hole division.
WT Revival won division.

This division:
Isaac Bowman vs Angel’s Envy
IB won.

This next round is Amador Double Barrel vs Jefferson’s Grand Selection (Sauternes). After this is Jefferson’s old rum cask vs Beer Barrel Bourbon. Did I mention that this is for science?

Nose on this is a double-Oaked bourbon, or maybe plain Jack Daniels. And by that I mean banana, sugar, and a bit of wood.

Body delivers on that banana and wood, but in a really bizarre and unpleasant way. The doubled-Oaked profile is bitter and dry, but the white wine finishing here introduces an unforgivingly sweet profile. And rather than neutralize or meet in the middle, this bitterness and sweetness is still fighting it out in my mouth. I do not like that one bit.

Finish goes back to the banana and wood.

So I threw some shade at a banana flavor profile clashing with dry, port wine. This little guy is way worse. I’m reading through the other tasting notes for this one, and I just don’t get it. There are times when I thought it would trigger a gag reflex. And I don’t think the flavors are gross, I think it’s the mouth feels. Will not buy again, but I’m hoping that before the bottle is gone, I can find more enjoyment from it. Jefferson’s wins this round."
