      Do you remember back in your college days when you had pretty much a different girlfriend every month?  It barely cost you a slice of pizza and a soda to qualify as a date back then.  Some of your ex's were the ones you still ponder about and ask yourself "" I wonder what life would've been like if I was with  "".   Or you  just wonder ""how in the world was I ever with an amazing beauty like  ""?   Well...this whisky isn't one of those.  This whisky is the type where you'll soon forget.  I can't even recall what the nose was like, or the taste.   No personality at all.  Just devoid of any body whatsoever.  (yes...we're now talking about the whisky, not my ex's.) .   I'd not buy a bottle version of this.  Not even if it was the cost of a mere pizza and soda."
