3.5,"Nose is oak, vanilla, bit of caramel and spice. Classic bourbon here.

Taste is warm, oak, grass, cinnamon spice, and a hint of sweetness.

Finish has a bit of heat for 90 proof with oak and spice notes."

4.0,Young but with a pleasant mouth feel.  I can’t get over the finish.  It’s like eating red hot candies after you swallowed them.  For under 20 bucks it’s way more drinkable than most in this range. Cheers

4.0,"Nice sipper, tastes like a blend of 1792 and Larceny. Not too much heat, medium finish. I enjoyed it."
