3.75,"in a world of complexity (yes I'm looking at you flat pack furniture) sometimes all you want is some simplicity. This dram is definitely that, honey, caramel, slight nuttiness and there you have it. I really quite enjoyed this for the dram it was, not one I would necessarily hurry back to but it definitely fitted the mood I was in."

3.25,"An apple juice. Dissapointing for a 21yo whisky, it is exactly as buying a Glen Moray Nas. 

Bottled at 40%abv.

Nose and palate are very simple.

On the nose: fresh apples, vanilla and a dim spicyness (cinammon).

Palate: coffee, brown sugar, liquorice. Finish oregano herbal note. 

Seems a lot like a speyside whisky. Very simple and not a worthy 21yo. It is about €90, so that is suspicious enough for a whisky of that age. Overall i give this dram a 68 over 100."
4.0,"Confused by the range on this, Get fruit. Get spicy oak. Get sherry notes. But all coming in at different points less normal than most. Will say its complex and I'm finding it tasty. But not an easy one to characterize. I guess I'd say, ""go with the experts on this."" But hoping additional tastings lead to a more cohesive assessment."
