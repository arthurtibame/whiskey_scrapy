You'd be better off with standard Black Label, and if you can find the Green Label, you're worlds ahead of this blend that sells more on marketing than on substance."

4.0,"Suprisingly good. I like The Adventurer from the explorers collection, I like the sugar cane taste from the Caribbean, I guess this one also is related to the Caribbean being the bottle made for ships. It is an adventurer but with more depth, more floral with fine cherry notes and vanilla. Easy on the palate with a sugar cane alcohol taste. A good whiskey"

4.0,"If you like black label then you'll enjoy this. It's very mellow, creamy, velvety and surprisingly thick for a blend. I'd say same quality as the black label but different taste. This has more ""dried fruit"" and more in depth compared to the black label it's got a sweet grain driven flavour but you can definitely taste some older whisky in here and it's pretty good. It honestly tasted like a really really premium red label (if red label was aged for 18yrs). Overall I paid $35 usd equivalent for this and at that price I consider it good. If it's more than $50 usd I would never buy this. Just stick with the black label, both are good just in different ways.

Edit: I'm having a chivas regal 21 right now and the swing tastes more complex and has a thicker richer mouthfeel"

5.0,"Johnnie Walker : Swing, a no age statement blended scotch whiskey. Price : $62.99, Sampled on 5/8/14 with 3/4 teaspoon of water in a Glencairn spirits nosing glass.

Aroma - Fruit basket, bright flora, honey, vanilla, light brown sugar, spice, cacao, cherry pits and cherry wood, tea and raisin.

Flavor - Sweet and sour, smokey, fudge, raisins and English breakfast tea. 

Finishes with a medium lingering flavor and burn.

Final score : 4.5 / 5, not sure what's up with the low scores here, in my opinion this is one of the finest blended scotches I've had and definitely is the best thing Johnnie Walker produces. Will definitely buy again."

3.0,"Again, not too bad but for the cost. The bottle is a nice decorative touch but what's in it isn't exactly knock your socks off. Nice to have as an oddity to share with that ""I only drink Chivas12/JohnnyBlack"" guy. A great bottle to bring to a poker game or get together where there will be a small crowd of moderate-to-serious scotch drinkers."

Avoid...and move on."

1.75,"Nose: Immediate malt notes with a hint of lemon and oak, sugar cane can be found with hints of pear, green apple and walnuts. Very slight floral and cream notes. 

Palate: Dry from the start with oak, vanilla and malt. Slight nuts and very light cream, gives off a very brief vegetative notes, reminding almost of peat.

Finish: very brief with hints of malt and oak."

4.0,"People turn their nose up at this because of the gimmicky bottle, but, there’s actually a very tasty whisky inside. It’s a sweet, slightly smoky, but most importantly a very approachable drinker. There’s a vanilla toasted smoothness to this. Is it exceptional? No...but would I blind taste this and hide the bottle, to try to impress some snobs, you betcha. Buy one, and enjoy it, it’s worth the freight"

3.25,"Nose: Vanilla and fruits on the back, strong oak and alcohol flavor on the top.. Moderately peaty  

Taste: some alcohol in the beginning going to a smooth fruity flavour

Aftertaste: long and woody, leaves a peaty palade

Better than expected, worth to have one on your shelf

3.75,On the noise is very sweet vanilla notes. Very sweet fruit with light honey notes. Very smooth finish.
3.5,Light sweet aromas on the nose. Light sweet notes on the palate followed by a quick punch of alchohol burn. Slight peaty smoke after taste.
