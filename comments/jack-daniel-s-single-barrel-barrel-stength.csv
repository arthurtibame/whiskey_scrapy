4.5,"Not a huge JD fan but this is really good.  Will absolutely destroy your palate before anything lower proof so drink those before you get to this.  Strong but smooth.  Get a lot of burnt brown sugar, banana, dark fruit (plum)? . Nice long smooth finish.  This is the only one I feel a couple drops of water does justice. Don’t have a hard time finding either, get one ☝️"

4.0,"Rural Inn Select #1
N: Similar to Elijah Craig Barrel Proof. Loads of sweet Barrel notes, leather, vanilla, chocolate, baking spices, very enjoyable but has some heat as well. 
P: very oily on the palate, really runs nicely over your mouth. I get a lot of oak and dark chocolate on the palate. I tend to find these same notes in most Barrel Proof bourbons. It does have a nice punch to it and long finish. The more you sip the more enjoyable it becomes. 
Takeaways: this could be disguised as GT Stagg or EC Barrel Proof and I think it would sneak past most without even knowing. It isn’t quite as refined as the higher end bourbons but for $65 sign me up all day."

5.0,"What is it about this that I like so much? It's unique to my palate. Perhaps it's the charcoal mellowing?  I've got a barrel pick and it's easily one of my favorite bottles. Delicious, deep nose. The flavor is a bit tropical/coconut, maple and molasses...sweet and vanilla. Great finish as well.  It's got that burn, but it's brief."

4.0,"Sweet despite the proof with a smooth fire on the back end with a ton of flavor on the back of the tongue. Charred oak, spice, cherry/vanilla. A bit numbing"

5.0,"Hands down favorite whiskey. Strong, rich, and flavorful. Packs a punch of spicy sweetness. Loads of barrel, I mean wood pouring in. Dominates the palate. Sweeeet, thick sticky sweetness. Intense! Spicy! Most intensely flavorful whiskey I've ever had. Just a mack truck whiskey. Not for the lightweights. 10/10"

4.5,Love the barrel proof. Nose of fruit and sweet. Palate of banana and alcohol along with spice. Love this.
5.0,"Nose... Caramel, chocolate, banana, cinnamon and ethanol due to the high alcohol volume...

Color... A wonderfully rich mahogany.. 

Taste... It's really complex to say the least. From cinnamon to apricots to pepper and brown sugar, all the way to licorice and seasoned wood it's a very welcoming handful...

Overall.... It's a STEAL to be honest. The Lincoln county process makes this whiskey a must have. It's just so flavorful at a very intense ABV. Just damn good and, I will be happy to buy another bottle once this is desert dry..."

5.0,"The whiskey is amber in colour with notes of sweet vanilla, toasty oak, citrus, dried fruit, brown sugar and black pepper. I first tasted it in Glencairn glass where I experienced a strong burn immediately on the nose and then I tasted it in the Norlan glass with a few drops of water which opened it up. The glass itself removed the whiskey burn so for people who are experiencing the burn please try with a better glass for a better experience. It’s an awesome whiskey to be enjoyed in moderation."
4.0,"Deep caramal nose, few drops of water and opened up to a bananas foster"
4.5,"Definitely picking up the banana notes on smell. I tasted it with an ice cube, the heat is from the high proof is a bit overwhelming to me. After it mellowed with the ice i noticed more cinnamon, with a bit of vanilla that smooths it out, before finishing spicy again. The taste lasts for a few minutes after swallowing, which is amazing in itself! Great whiskey!"
4.25,Lots of banana and caramel.

3.5,"Aroma - overpowering booze mixed with leather and cinnamon / taste - sweet heat immediately takes over as your mouth becomes a raging inferno. / finish - cinnamon candy that lasts for minutes.

This stuff is sadistic and leaves you wanting more"

4.0,"The nose on this reminds me of walking through the rickhouses on my trip to Kentucky. The bottle I got is from Rick L-2 and is at 68% ABV. As it tilted the glass back, the nose turned a little more sweet with stronger caramel notes. The palate was delicious and it was surprisingly smooth, virtually no alcohol burn. The finish could have been a little longer but overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase!"

4.0,Caramel sugar up front eases into vanilla and toffee. Hints of butterscotch on the nose. Very assertive.
