3.0,"This was a recommendation of my local whisky dealer. 

While being a blend (due the presence of grainwhiskies?) the origin of all of it's base spirits appears to be the Speyside distillery, containing young spirits between 3-5 years old, though the grainwhiskies used are said to be older. 

The name of this 'Black Burn' blend is said to be inspired by 'William Blackburn', a former blacksmith, who used his expertise to burn a selection of the barrels he used to help 'flavour' his wiskies.

The shop-owner let me taste a dram, and considering the price, found it to be pretty good: The smell is somewhat sweet, with honey and flowers. The sweet notes return on the palate, with a small accent of wood, vanille and some dried fruits. The aftertaste is rather short, but pleasant. While definitely not a peated whisky, I still imagine to detect a small amount of smoke. Apparently, this is a good dram to pair with dark chocolate.

Sidenote: I also like the shape of the bottle. Once empty, I plan to keep it around as alternative karaf for my homemade perpetuumblend..."
