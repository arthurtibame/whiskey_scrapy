5.0,"Ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages, every now and then you get to REALLY drink whisky. Good, balanced, rich, wonderful Whisky that is. Most of the times when you drink Talisker, you get this sensation that something great has happened. Well, today i had the chance to taste a whisky distilled in 1955 and bottled in 2005, a 50yo scotch, FROM THE ISLE OF SKYE WHERE ONLY EXISTS ONE DISTILLER: TALISKER.

So, the new make on this was distilled on the 27th of may of 1955, and rest in a sherry cask (no. 1312) for 50 years. A Talisker new make. (Or a ""secret still"" if you may).

Bottled at 45%abv, the most dark old oak color. Beautiful. 

On the nose it wasn't perfect but it was beautiful. Sherry, Heather, Lemon, Stairfruit, Leather, Red fruits, Oranges, Caramel. Peat presents itself in a heather note. 23/25.

On the palate it was SUBLIME. 

My first sip i had it for at least one minute in my mouth without drinking it. It was an explosion of flavor, perfectly balanced, absolutely pleasant. Red fruits, Strawberry, Pepper, Oaky but incredibly refined, Heather. AMAZING STUFF. Maybe the best i have had.  25/25.

Aftertaste was simply outstanding. Tobbacco, Dry grass, So refined so balanced. Oakyness incredible ginger, Ashy. It was eternal. The longest aftertaste ever. I did have it in my mouth for at least 10 minutes before it completely faded. Perfect score.

Overall, this is what angels search in their share. This is without a doubt one of the greatest drams i  have had. I believe it is super expensive (around $2.200) but i got a sample from a friend and every drop is a miracle. My score system says 98, but who gives a damn about my score system; THIS IS A 100 OVER 100. PERFECT SCORE. May the force be with you, young Skywalker. Slainte mhath!"
