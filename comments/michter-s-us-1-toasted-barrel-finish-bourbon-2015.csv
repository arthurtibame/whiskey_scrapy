3.0,I liked last years better. I thought it was a better mix of the oak and bourbon. The wood favors are a bit much for me. Glad I have a bottle of last years left.

3.0,"Sweeter than expected. A lot like a golden brown marshmallow over a campfire. Not where it catches fire and gets charred, but where it takes 10 min. to get it perfectly carmelized on all sides."

5.0,"Good lord this is a good bourbon. Banana, vanilla and pineapple right up front. If that's the characteristic you like in your bourbon, you found it. Price is kinda high though. Something similar that's cheaper (but a little less profound) would be Old Forrester Original. Love them both."

4.25,Marshmallow and vanilla. Campfire. Smooth and sweet. You can really taste the toasted barrel.
2.0,Preferentially the flavor on the back end has a little too much bite.
4.0,Good. Need to try again.

4.0,"Tasted at Haymarket in Louisville

The nose is vanilla, baking spices, freshly baked bread. 
Thicker mouthfeel. Sweet, some caramel, some cola, and leather.
A lighter finish. On the medium side.
It’s good for sure, but would not seek it out or pay stupid money for it."

4.75,The toasted barrel comes through with typical Michter’s smoothness.  Very close to the American whisky but taking the richness of flavors to a new level
