There's a quality about it that's reminiscent of a dry white wine from the Loire (Sancerre, etc.), or a true Chablis. The nose has crisp green apple, quince, a bit of grassiness, and a hint of vanilla. On the palate, there's an initial burst of sweet vanilla, followed by a rush of pepper and spice, with a sour green apple ribbon running down through it all...almost a pickled kind of sour at moments. It's delicious, and definitely it's own creature - well worth a try."

4.0,"This sample has been waiting for me for some time.  I read and heard mixed reviews; some liking, some disliking the varied nature of this spirit.  What camp would I fall into?
   
  The nose is immediately greeted with a damp straw funk, like straw from a musty barn.  That however, gently dissipates to the more staple notes of a Speysider with the likes of green apples, honey and vanilla.  A maltiness with cooking spice (allspice?) presents itself in due time.  As time progresses, so does the vanilla aromas and a soft sweetness.  For me, it conjures up mental images of a countryside on a dank summer’s day.  
   
  Upon sipping, the palate is sensed with a soft, pillowy texture and immediately start to think that this is going to one of those nice and gentle sweet and fruity drams from Speyside.  As you are lured towards that thinking, you will find that you were snared and you are hit from the flank with a blast of spice and heat.  This “exhilarating” (maybe too strong of a word) rollercoaster ride then goes from spicy heat, quickly to sweetness of vanilla, honey.  You then find yourself going up to a ginger-black pepper spice that eventually winds down to a woody fade, into the finish. 
   
  That finish is long  and warming.  Drying and bitter with touches of ginger root and a blast of mint.  At the same time, Chardonnay wine notes are detectable: vanilla, oak and white grape.
   
  This is a whisky that touches all the bases: sweet, bitter, drying and spicy.  Somewhat like a typical 13 year old teenager wanting to be everywhere at once; moving quickly and coming to exhaustive ending.  Oh, what an enjoyable ride!  [Dry Glass: Grapefruit and honey][88/100][Tasted: 5/26/17][$45]"

3.0,"Stop number 12 on the SDT is Craigellachie. This Speysider has been around a long time, but until a few years ago was only available as a component in blends, most notably in Dewar's. In 2014 the introduced a line of single malts, 13, 17, 23, and 31 year olds (all prime numbers). This one is 46% ABV and is non chill filtered and natural color of golden amber. 

At first whiff I can immediately recognize the Dewars notes. Fruity at first with mangos, apples and pears. Floral honey with a light smoke. Some green oak, wood spices, vanilla and a bourbon like sweetness. There is some cardboard in there as well. Malty too. Something odd happened after a little time as I got a distinct smell of dentist office and minty fluoride. Weird I know but that's what I got. Not unpleasant, but it was not welcoming either. Overall very green. 

The palate was a little less to my liking. Strong peppery arrival which I did enjoy, but it only goes downhill from there. Sour apples is dominant. Very green oak playing in the background with a fair amount of mint, but the mint is covered up by how sour it is. 

Medium bodied mouthfeel that is a bit oily and a little dry. Medium long finish that again is sour. Pepper and oak and a long lingering mint. 

I held this bottle in my hands many times in my travels only to put it back down and purchase something else. I loved the look of the label but something told me ""you won't like this as much as you think you will"". Turns out I was right. It's a very interesting dram for sure and some may love it, it's just not for me. I can see why it's used in blends, but I feel that's where it should stay.  Thanks to Ryan for the sample."

4.0,"Aroma: butterscotch, spirit, a touch of honey. Palate: full-bodied, dry, astringent, caramel tones on foreground, spices, developing to an intense perfume theme. Powerful, strong whiskey, bourbon aged (as i feel), representing it's very special perfume flavour. 3,7/5 stars (82 score)"
4.0,null
4.0,"Visual:  In the glass it is colored somewhere between a pilsner and a hefeweizen. A few good swirls create a few thin legs.

Nose:  If anyone ever questioned that scotch is distilled beer, this dram is proof. It is very malty/yeasty like a good craft ale with the intensity turned up to 11. There is also some spiciness almost like its whiskey counterparts this side of the pond – reminiscent of rye. After some rest, a few vegetal (carrot) and grassy notes waft in, along with caramel and oak notes. I also get the “cobblestones after the rain” quality that @Damon Williams notes.

Palate: Honey sweet, followed by arrival of spicy rye-like notes. Brown sugar mid-palate. This dram has a lot of presence on the palate – it is much less subtle than many of its Speyside cousins. It’s not a bludgeon, but it’s not delicate, either. There’s a bitterness on swallowing that is not unlike the hoppiness of beer, but without the citrusy notes found in a highly-hopped IPA. Sorry for the repeated beer analogies, but for some reason this whisky seems to keep reminding me of it.
 
Finish:  The finish is medium long and warming, with the hoppy bitterness continuing for a while, along with some medium-roast coffee notes and lingering brown sugar. Exhalation through the nose results in some aromas that remind me of Rittenhouse Rye.
  
All in all, I really like this one, and agree with @Revkev12 that it is a singular dram, although he picked up many notes I did not, and vice versa. I didn’t pick up as many fruity notes as others. However, for a Speyside, I thought it was exceptionally full and rich, with a lot of bourbon/rye qualities – as well as beer-like notes. I’ll certainly revisit this one. This is worth every bit of 85 points for a solid 4 stars. A hearty recommendation for those who want to try a Speyside that’s a little different than some others, or for bourbon/rye fans that are developing an appreciation for single malt scotch.

Postscript:  Given that scotch whisky is essentially distilled beer, it is amazing how few scotch reviews reference beer. This label screams “I am beer intensified,” IMHO."

4.0,"I am finally able to drag my slow-drinking self across the finish line for Round 1 of our Scottish Distillery tour group.  This is the 15th sample shared among 5 whisky friends and we are about to embark on round 2 in a couple of weeks.  This pour was supplied by my local friend, Ryan and was a pleasant surprise.  Craigellachie 13 Year is 92 proof and non-chill filtered.

It's very fruity on the nose, sweet tropical fruit.  It's in abundance here and it's quite mouth watering.  The typical wood and vanilla notes also round it out really well, with a wisp of mint to snap you back to attention if your nose strays too long in the Glencairn.

On the tongue, well those tropical fruits and orchard apples really play well together and make you just want to keep swirling it around until the spicy oak and mint begin to wash it away.

Speaking of the finish- it's pretty long.  There's the initial sweetness that turns peppery and ends on a final, semi-dry note.  That's it's only weakness to me.  All those tropical flavors are something I'd love to see hang around and encourage another sip.  The dryness just seems like an unwelcome and abrupt end.

It's still quite a fantastic dram.  I think I will add a full bottle of this to my next big, online order.  I wouldn't mind keeping this one on hand for those warm, summer nights that are almost here.  Thanks again, Ryan.  What a fitting way to end the first round of the SDT.  Bring on Round 2!  Cheers"

5.0,"PRICE: $45-70.
INFO: Single malt scotch whisky from Speyside.  Aged 13 years and bottled at 46%.  I cannot find any more details about the maturation.  For distillation, Craigellachie does boast the use of worm tub condensors, which intentionally makes the distillate more sulphury, heavier, and less fresh.

APPEARANCE: I don’t care about packaging or E150a.  Whisky is about smell and taste.  But, I must make an exception to commend the packaging here.  Quirky, bold, anachronistic, and recyclable.

NOSE: 92/100.  The top note is rich, ripe apples.  Underneath, there is hay, earth, and definite sulphurous notes.  It takes the utmost confidence in your product to play with Sulphur notes.  This does not do it as boldly and brilliantly as Springbank 10, but it definitely works.  At the bottom layers, there is honey, heather, peat, and deli meat.  

PALATE: 96/100.  Chimeric.  This is one of the most complex whiskies I’ve tasted.  What prevents this from being perfect is that things are not really harmonious, and sometimes it feels like an argument inside the mouth.  But, this is one of the few whiskies where I can say that every flavor is present, and nothing is dominating.  Some sips highlight the fruitiness, others the meatiness, still others the spiciness.  It’s pointless to list individual flavors.  Noticeably, this is not-sweet and will thus pair well with many entrees (to hell with wine!).

FINISH: 90/100.  “Anything but smooth.”  That’s from the online distillery note.  What cheek!  Yeah, it goes down a tad sharp and astringent.  But there’s some delicious and unqiue umami-ness going on.  Some nice Applewood pork.  Cured for sure.  Nitrates and sulphites.  Mmmm.

OVERALL: Where has this bottle been all my life?  I’ve only explored this distillery this year, but I’m in love with Craigellachie.  The audacity of only putting out prime-number age statements and advertising about how unsmooth and challenging it is.  On the bottle “…old-fashioned worm tubs to cool our spirit and bestow it with extra flavor, creating a dram to rival whiskies twice its age.”  It’s not just about the worm tubs because a handful of other distilleries do it, but none with results like this.  It’s true about rivaling whiskies twice its age.  Unfortunately, I’ve not come across any older official bottlings, but even the young independent bottlings are astoundingly complex.  There’s flavors that I’ve never experienced, and flavors that probably do not exist outside these bottles: red bananas, goat eggs, turkleberry, and the smell as you enter the halls of Griffindor.

MARK: 93/100.
VALUE FOR MONEY: This wins best VFM bottle of the year for me out of bottles I’ve tried for the first time this year.  It’s such a bonus that this is versatile enough to go with multiple foods and becomes a different experience depending on what you’re pairing with.  This will be my go-to dram probably for the year-to-come."

4.0,"For some reason, people associate the word ""meaty"" with this scotch from Speyside.  I'm not sure what that means, as this dram does not exhibit any of the savory notes that I find in some sherry-aged Islay single malts.  This is actually a fragrant, aromatic scotch, at least to me.  The aromas are enticing:  pear, white peach, some salinity, and hay.  Maybe some young, unripe apples too.  This whisky exhibits first-rate texture on the palate, with attractive thickness and viscosity.  Perhaps it's that rich, full nature that people describe as ""meaty"" -- if scotches were soups, this one would be a chowder.  The palate features oatmeal, whole grains sprinkled with sugar, and that cornucopia of fruit.  If anything, there's some sharp citric acid supplementing that complexity.  The finish balances out cream, smoke like a brulee, and apple again, almost as if this was a mildly peated scotch.  This scotch also features generous doses of pine and oak; this is a whisky that acts its age.  There's something bitter or somewhat off-putting at the end, which is the main flaw.  Nonetheless, if you can find this for under $50, it's a pretty strong value."

4.0,"They say the cask makes up to 2/3rds of the whiskey flavour and for me  for non peated whiskies usually the cask quality and type are centre stage and the new make is second fiddle. There are exceptions of course and this is one of them. I'm pretty sure the cask type was chosen not to get in the way of the new makes profile as I don't get a lot past sweet vanilla, spice, pepper etc but man the underlying spirit is sure interesting. I love this type of dram. It's not as meaty as say a Mortlach but everything is perfectly balanced. I'd love to see what another type of casking could do for this one. $60USD here and 4.25 at least. As an update / aside I found a sample of Mortlach Special Strength and cracked it open to compare. Similar profile but the Mortlach is heavier more sulfuric slightly harsher aftertaste. I like both for different reasons but the Craig 13 takes it for me even before you add in the 40% cheaper price....better balance. The Craig 13 I could drink endlessly the Mortlach not so much."

4.0,"Nose: Malty and earthy with pungent oily, cereal and fruit notes and some interesting spice - ginger, and allspice (but mild).  There is an aroma of camphorwood which I don't think I've ever sensed from a whisky before.

Palate: Robust arrival underpinned by the same characteristics found in the nose - earthy, cereal, spicy and vegetal. A very nice mouthfeel which is just oily enough to be slightly mouthcoating.

Finish: Medium. Veering into some hot tannins and finally swinging to sweetness in the aftertaste, much in the way ale is bitter then sweet.

This is a bourbon-matured ""earthy"" Speysider like Glen Elgin (although that also has some sherry influence) rather than being of the sweet sherry-heavy persuasion like so many others of that region.  In many ways, it is reminiscent of a young Springbank, and that's not bad company to keep. If you like Springbank, Glen Elgin, or even Old Pulteney or Clynelish then you'll most likely enjoy this whisky.
                    
After having a bottle open for some months, and now about 2/3 full, I've found that it has oxidized with considerable grace. Everything has rounded out but without losing character or becoming thick and heavy. The initial hot bitterness in the finish has become a rich, earthy sweetness that was totally unexpected, followed by a spicy note that is almost Talisker like.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

Orange peels. Yellows and mellows with time in the bottle. Reminiscent of an unpeated Caol Ila. (I could have sworn I got a whiff of something wet sherry cask-like, HP-like, almost heathery, out of the bottle one day, but I've lost it.)

Gooseberries, apricot marmalade, cream, vanilla sugar. Cloudberry marmalade and thick sweet sour cream (a combination I tried in some pancake roll ups once. Delicious.) Frozen yogurt. Sassafras root. Ginger. Molasses, rum-like. Dense waxy malt. Malty. Chili note. Cocoa powder, dusty cocoa. Bit bitter. Classic style dry SELTZER WATER. Mineral. Old oak, in the background, like oak furniture sitting in an old wood house. Walnuts. HONEY, natural, pungent, unprocessed.

The sulfur tones ever so slightly down and marries with the caramel fullness of this dram with aeration.

A heavy but not at all harsh maltiness.

They say this has a meaty character to it, but I would say it is *bready*. Specifically, I get bread *sticks*. Kind you get in restaurants. Touch of olive oil. Tiny bit of garlic."

4.5,"Got this at the Twins sale for the ridiculous price of $33, what a steal!  Yes it has nice old-timey labeling and a unique age statement at 13 yrs but what it really has going for it are the worm tubs they use in the distillation. Imagine a typical scotch and then add 20 pounds of muscle. You can really notice the extra weight but there is no fat, all flavor. Poured neat, succulent rich malt and fruit notes along with some spice and wood. Palate is robust malt and fruit cocktail with just a touch of peat/smoke, roasted coffee and sweet wood. The mouthfeel is viscous  providing a wonderful tactile experience. Finishes long with plenty of malt, fruit, light peat,  spice and barrel that just hangs on without becoming too dried out. The faint smoke appears as well but this is not a heavily peated dram. Overall a delicious thick dense single malt with an abundance of flavor  that is elite and one of the top non smoke profile single malts out there imo .........94/100......at the price I paid its 5 star all day. Had I known I would have grabbed another, will stock this next Twins sale in Feb"

Score - 85/100

Final Thoughts - This was a nice dram and I think if tasted blind, I'd probably think of it like a mix between a higher proof Glenlivet 12 mixed with a Clynelish 14 as it has the classic flavors of a more standard ex-Bourbon Speyside, but with the nice waxy mouthfeel of a Clynelish. This was nice, enjoyable, nothing too complex but is nice to sip on without thinking too much. Good neat or in a highball or even as a base for cocktails I think it'd hold up, although it might lose a bit of the waxy mouthfeel with additional dilution.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - If I could find it for ~$40 USD"
4.25,"I'm always comforted by the lovely notes on the nose of a true and proper Speyside whisky. There is something floral yet earthly in the scent. I may not be dreaming of sugar plum fairies, but there is certainly something there that evokes said imagery in my mind. This whisky invokes a kind of poison apple. I'm intrigued, but there is something I cannot trust. But in a good way. 

On the tongue that same sense lingers. I'm treated with a wonderful pleasure, but am still unable to put my guard down. There is something about this whisky that leads me to think this old, abandoned castle still has skeletons crawling. Though, further intrigued, I continue to explore these halls and wonder the source of the beauty I experience. I feel I may be doing this whisky wrongly because it is very good indeed and I don't want to discourage. Finding, or rather stumbling, my way through the complexities will always yield varied experiences. 

In short, Craigellachie 13 is a great whisky that all should try. Speyside-ness shines through, but I never thought I was drinking a Macallan or Aberlour. This stands out as unique and lovely with a extra edge of darkness. While I may prefer a Balvenie as a staple, I wouldn't dare question a wizard who drinks Craigellachie by the fireside.

4.25,"As part of last night’s Craigellechie tasting, this was in the lineup along with a 17 yr old, and an extremely rare 51 yr old (only 51 bottles—-all allocated for free tasting to 150 people randomly selected by lottery).  

If you like Springbank 10, you’ll like this.  It’s rough. It’s rugged.  Meaty, full of sulfurous notes, chewy oily texture, and herbaceous.  Personally I feel it’s easy to like a smooth balanced whisky, but difficult to make and like a rough one.  This is a testament to Craigellechie’s production process.  Sure it’s NCF and no-coloring, but they go much further.  They use traditional coal fired to distill vs the automated method (only ones to do so now).  The also distill in a fashion that retains some of the sulfurous compounds, which is an act of sheer craftsmanship—-too much retention and you’ll feel as if your sucking on a matchstick.  

I’d be a buyer of this—-very in-Speyside like, more Cambeltown like"

4.25,"I am not fond of speyside malts, but this one i recommend. Nothing to die for, but definitively one of the greatest expressions i have had from that scottish region. As expected very light aroma, but a surprising taste and finish makes this one worth your money.

Bottled at 46%abv (this is why it is better than other speyside malts) burnished gold color.

On the nose is typical speyside and very simple: Pear juice, Apple juice
Cinammon spice very gentle, Vanilla cream.

On the palate it is full and delicious: Oaky, Spicy, Orange.  Actually a Spice bomb; Caramelized apple and Honey.

There is a puff of smoke somewhere. Call me crazy but it is there.

Finish is long, another spice bomb made by pepper with some smoke. 

Overall i give to this fine dram a well deserved 89/100, and i am looking forward to taste older expressions."
