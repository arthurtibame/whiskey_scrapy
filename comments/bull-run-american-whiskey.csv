0.75,"This was a rough one for me, being accustomed to straight bourbons and favoring wheaters. The nose had clear brown sugar and wine notes that carry into the pallet. The flavor is whiskey in the front finishing with Pinot Noir, which are complete odds with each other. The finish reminds me of a bad case of heartburn."
4.0,There's not a ton of flavor but it's very smooth and incredibly creamy. Love the mouthfeel. Subtle and well balanced.

4.75,Very smooth 10 year old that was really aged an additional 18+ months in Pinot Noir Barrels. Not sure why the age statement is not 12 years?  Beautiful Pinot finish on the end. Going back for more!
