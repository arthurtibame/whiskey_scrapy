Licht medicinaal
Soort Ardbeg light"
4.0,"A good intro for non-Islay drinkers. The beginning is sweet and smooth, with a peppery spice introducing itself in the middle, and finished with a smoky peat at the end"

4.0,"loved this - reminiscent of laphroaig and ardbeg in the smokiness category, not quite as full in the mouth"
3.0,"I've not had the 40% expression but the cask strength has a nice flavors profile. Still missing that fullness in the middle to tie it in but not bad. Seasoned wood smoke, sweet, slight cherry and citrus. Alcohol comes in at the end."
3.0,"Another sample from my Christmas gift set. Interesting nose. Malty, with dried cherries, cherry syrup, and some smoke. Slightly sweet palate at the beginning, leading to a rapid, hot, smoky finish. Surprisingly hot given the low ABV. I would compare this to decaffeinated coffee: missing a certain roundness in the middle. The flavor does not match the nose. 

I give it a C-, 70 points, a scant 3 stars."
4.0,Vanilla and oak mixed with smoke and sea salt. Hints of oranges and chocolate

3.0,"Picked this up in a tiny little village in northern Germany.  Not overly impressed, the peat is quite subdued and not in the standard sense you get from aged barrels.  No real impact"

5.0,"I love this whiskey. It's inbetween Islay and the mainland. Inbetween smooth and rough.  Great mouthfeel, taste and finish."

God røg
Kan godt klare et par dråber vand"
1.0,Too much peat for my taste
4.0,Surprisingly soft. Despite a strong peat aroma it hits the tongue sweet and and follows through with a little pepper spice and then following with peat.  The overall flavor is quick and doesn't linger much. If you're trying to love peat this may be a good intro.
