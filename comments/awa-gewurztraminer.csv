4.0,"Excellent not heavy whisky.
The smell is very light and quite fruity. The taste is very light (a must for persons who start whisky).
The ex-wine barrel adds a soft touch and makes it a bit oily and round.
Vanilla and grapefruit taste are predominants as well as a bit of cinnamon.
Sweet and lovely"
