3.5,Drank it at Bills. Smooth not too spicy
null,"Rapid City trip. Very mellow on the nose. Fruity smell, but very very light. This theme is repeated across the pallet. It’s well balanced, very light. Flavors are all fruit. Surprising warmth after the finish."
3.75,BBF tasting. good.

3.5,A light nose hinting towards sweet. A light burn and a soft pallet. The finish turns a bit earthy or savory.

4.25,"Of the five tasted tonight, probably my second favorite. A little spicier than the others, except Noah’s Mill, and a softer, rounder profile. Good stuff, friendly."

3.5,Sweet and smooth. Not as full bodied or rich as I was expecting for the price.

3.75,"Cherry on the nose with a good amount of oak present. Second wave brings butterscotch. Flavor has notes of coffee, pepper, some mint and clove. Later some cocoa in the nose. Couple drops of water later brought out more fruit notes in the flavor. And then a touch of almond."
