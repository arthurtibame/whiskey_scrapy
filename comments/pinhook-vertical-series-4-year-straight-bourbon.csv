4.0,"Nose: very unique nose. I get an earthy/sweet note. Heavy caramel. 

Palate: rye up front with some sweet somethin. Definitely a young bourbon but so much potential. 

Finish: short and spicy"

4.5,Upon uncorking nose is strong yet fruity. First couple sips are hotter than expected but once you get into it the smoothness takes over for a truly delightful experience.

4.25,"After opening for a week this bottle really opens up, some vanilla and Carmel with a spicy finish.  Good start to this vertical series by Pinhook."

3.0,The nose is soft with lite oak and maple. The softness continues on the front of the palate and builds through the finish. Not overly complex or balanced but the little nuances may have you coming back for more.
