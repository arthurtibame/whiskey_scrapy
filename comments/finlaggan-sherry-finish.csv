4.0,"Smooth, rather sweet, strong smokey in palate and the after taste"
3.75,"Oct 2019.
Clear medium gold.
Aromatic spicy clove, star anise, burned pork, and a little charred sweet potato in nose.
Warm rich smoky bacon, campfire, oily brine, charred chicken stock, and some charred cedar in the palate.
Ok balance, spicy smoke finish.
Smells not attractive but the mouthfeel and aftertaste is fine."
