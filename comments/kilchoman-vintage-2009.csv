3.0,"I bought a bunch of samples from Kilchoman while visiting for Feis Ile 2018, just now getting around to typing out my notes.  I would rate this as one of my less favorite Kilchomans, although I love their line as a whole, so it'd still be a solid B in my book. While Machir Bay is the best value in the line and a very similar scotch to Ardbeg 10, and Sanaig and Loch Gorm deliver sherry influence, Vintage 2009 is defined less by its finish and more by the clear vintage age statement, which marks it as significantly older than the other mainstays in Kilchoman's lineup. The age may help a little, but what it brings is more than a passing resemblance to Caol Ila 12. The nose is vegetal and peaty, with a vanilla note that's not present in other Kilchomans. The palate features a nice lemon citrus flavor that's familiar to any drinker of Machir Bay, more vanilla, and a light plum, along with the customary Kilchoman smoke. The smoke is most prominent on the finish. This boils down to a slightly more expensive bottle of Caol Ila 12, so I'll slightly downgrade its rating on Distiller's star system."

4.0,"The fifth sample of a 7 part Kilchoman (custom) sample set my wife got me for my birthday. As with the other 'special' releases in this set (Madeira/Sauterne Cask Matured) this 2009 Vintage, was rather soft on the smoke in the nose, but was (luckily) quite a bit bolder in the palate. It's a (small) peat bomb nevertheless, but very nicely balanced with sweet, soft fruits, which linger on in the aftertaste, together with a whiff of smoke. I'll very likely purchase a bottle of this vintage (or a next version)."

4.0,"Aha...asked how the round went I was honest. Nothing blew me away...I then mentioned my core must try distilleries. ""We have the latest 09 release""...woohoo my night is saved. Now it's no Red Wine, Sanaig or even a Loch Gorm but it's good. 4 stars finally. Can't wait in 2 weeks time the distillery owners will be here for Dramfest so I'll get to get stuck in to wherever else I haven't tried of theirs and congratulate them on a great distillery and awesome casking effort!"
