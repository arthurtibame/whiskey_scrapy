5.0,"""Do you have any Circus,"" I asked jokingly at Whisky Jewbilee tonight. Lo and behold, the bottle  hidden in the Orangie box was nothing less than the latest Compass Box unicorn. And what a treat. A beautiful long, dark sherry finish, with a slightly spicy edge. It was lingering even as I tucked into the smoked salmon five minutes later, almost reluctantly. An awesome inspiring trapeze act. Sampled June 15, 2016."

5.0,"Color: Deep Amber
Nose: Hugely aromatic. Stewed dark fruits, plum, black raspberry, cassis, and a wine grape component, no doubt from the many years it spent in sherry casks. Baked black cherry and a lighter citrus note, with a backbone of butterscotch and toffee.
Palate: The older age of the component whiskies immediately is evident, with mature oak and barrel smoke, balanced with the dark fruits, and vanilla, with the intensity upped due to the higher ABV.
Finish: A grain whisky component is present on the finish, allowing it to finish strong but not overbearing or syrupy, playing well with the oak and fruit notes to the end.
Overall: A high price point for a whisky, without a doubt, but an incredibly rich and deep whisky at any price. Glaser again demonstrates the combination of grace and power, of complexity and depth, which can be achieved with thoughtful blending."

4.5,"Who loves limited release Compass Box whiskies?  This guy (Points both thumbs back at self).  Thanks you an anonymous friend, from the Boston area, I was able to sample this exotic CBW without having to pop the cork on my personal bottle.  This offering was released a couple of years ago and has garnered some great reviews and I’m thrilled to finally be able to taste it for myself.

This one is dark gold in the taster, and true to CBW form, has no added color and isn’t chill filtered.  It produces some fat, oily legs and really fat droplets in your tasting glass.  It’s bottled at 49% ABV and cost a whopping $300 when it was released.  Secondary market prices are still holding in the $300+ range, although they are harder to find now.

The nose started out with lots of tropical fruits:  tangy citrus, luscious mango and banana with some typical, orchard fruits entangled alongside it.  Green apples and ripened pear slices dipped in honey give way to some serious Four Roses-type florals and spices.  The oak slips away leaving this one tasting more like a liquified apple pie drizzled with a vanilla creme glaze.

The palate feels light and very juicy before turning spicy by mid sip.  More tropical notes abound before the spice and pepper take over.  At no point is there any evidence of youthful spirit, no harsh or abrasive backbone, it’s just silky and a tad dry.

The finish brings more sweet vanilla and a lingering juiciness that you really never want to end.  It’s long and mouthwatering- I believe it made me more thirsty.  Sadly, I only had an ounce to entertain my taste buds before having to return to something much less enticing.

This is a wonderful dram- another fine example of what John Glaser can do with some of the incredible whisky stock he has on hand.  When I took a look at their website to inquire what exactly was used here, it appears they want to keep this one a bit more of a secret (either that or I should’ve looked when the bottle was first released).  All I see now is:  Highland blend parcel 1, parcel 2, blended grain and Benrinnes.  Hmmm.  Ah, really it doesn’t matter, it’s damn good.  It may be a stretch declaring it $300 good, but that’s another discussion.  This is 4.5 star whisky.  Grab a pour if you see a bottle near you- you won’t be disappointed.  Thanks again, Mr Anonymous New Englander!  I owe you one (or two).  Cheers."

5.0,"Blending magic.  Simple as that.  I came home after a week of vacation in the rain forests of Costa Rica, and found a nice sample of this provided by a friend of mine.  After a week of just one pour ( Glenfiddich Winter Storm), and daily juices of various fruits and berries, this dram was a welcome sight to sore eyes and taste buds.  I can’t really describe it...it’s just a whirlwind of flavors...rich, oily, yet light and fruity.  You definitely get the sherry (seems like oloroso), but you can tell there’s really high quality well aged grain in there too, from the fruity backbone.  Why the hell didn’t I buy a bottle when it was readily available?  Hindsight is 20/20, but for now...enjoying this."

5.0,"Simply amazing!  This whisky is genius. The nose spins like a kaleidoscope of dizzying fragrances. Crisp, clean, dry sherry; probably both Oloroso and Fino, as the 4 components that make up this marriage spent their entire maturation in sherry butts. Rich, varnish like ethanol confirms old wood and an average age of blended whiskies calculated at 25.53 years. The blended grain piece exceeds 30 years in sherry with individual constituents spending additional time in unknown barrel types. As the wheel continues to turn an entire fruit basket of fruits and nuts arrives at your door in an awesome celebration of life. The composition is so delectable you’re not sure which piece to pick off first. This is followed by, I swear, elements of both bourbon and rye spiciness wrapped in honeyed vanilla. The complexity seems incomprehensible. If ever I’ve experienced a non-smoky whisky better than this, I know not when. The natural, amber colored liquid hits the tongue so smoothly that it belies its 49% ABV backbone. What can I say, it’s a rich and luscious medley of everything previously described that finishes extraordinarily well. Curiosity hints at a drop of water, but my mind is convinced the earth’s entire supply has vanished and won’t be available again until the next good rain. Good grief, I will have to suffer in ecstasy until then.  5 stars!"
