4.75,"Just opened the bottle I got at Deanston (sister distillery) and as promised came with this (express) review:

“O M G !!!

Caramelised apple, smoked bacon, “funkiness” and a salty edge...

Weird?

I freaking ❤️ it!

(Disclaimer: not for the faint of heart)”

It is indeed so weird that it keeps it 1/4 point apart from the perfect score... 

It’s not your every day dram, nor will you always be on the mood for it, but when you are, it sure is one hell of a ride!"
3.25,"Damn I'm excited. Dramfest NZ is 6 weeks away and as a bonus I managed to score sessions for me and one of my mates to
1) a rare top shelf session with Dave Broom and Charles MacClean
2) a single cask 1990's Glendronach session with the Global Ambassador 
3) 3 special Ardbeg releases presented by Brendan McCarron who is Head of Maturing Whisky Stocks (who knew that's a title). Apparently he also helped to design Roseisle Distillery, managed Oban Distillery, and acted as Group manager for Lagavulin and Caol Ila Distilleries and Port Ellen Maltings on Islay. A man who knows his stuff!

Anyhow to the whiskey. I'm thinking (no offense to fans) I consider Ledaig a poor mans Kilchoman (and not from a cost perspective). Why?

It's got that Kilchoman peat characteristic however it (in my personal opinion) ruins it for me by the acidic peat element it imposes over the top. I find Kilchoman more balanced, well rounded and often creamy. My first bottle of Ledaig was the 10 which I hated then really loved and then really disliked. It remains to this day the only bottle which I have fallen out, in and out of love so intensely. 

It's a dram I really get why some love and some hate. 

Anyhow this particular dram is so so, overriding acidity with a sweeter Amontillado overlay. Not one for me."

4.0,Very very intense! Kinda love it but could only happen on rare occasions. Kinda like Kilchoman only far far beyond edge.
3.25,"I'm a big fan of Ledaig 10 ans 18. This sounded like a hidden treasure. Unfortunately, the high ABV didnt do it for me. I still haven't found the proper ammount of water to add to it in order to fully appreciate what my amateurish palate seems to dislike."
4.75,"Tasted at Deanston distillery. (1 year ago)

This is a very complex and tasteful whisky.
Just so smoky, meaty and full of flavors. Amazing stuff!

I will write some detailed tasting notes as soon as I open the bottle that I bought right after my fist sip.

The low score on this one was bothering me because this is simple put - brilliant!"
3.5,"This is a limited edition bottling of the Tobermory distillery’s peated spirit. It spent some final portion of its 13 years in Amontillado sherry casks, but I couldn’t find any information on how long. At its cask strength of 59.2%, there are creamy pears and malt on the nose, with a hint of sawdust. Diluted to 50%, a bit of funk emerges. In the mouth, it’s fruity and slightly sour, like grapefruit with a dash of pepper. There’s a creamy note too. The finish is long and heavy on the cayenne pepper. This is my first whisky from this distillery so I don’t know how much the flavor deviates from the base spirit, but the sherry cask influence seems subtle — and none the worse for that. My guess is that the Amontillado finish comprised only six months to a year. Overall, a tasty dram that will have me seeking more whisky from the Isle of Mull."
