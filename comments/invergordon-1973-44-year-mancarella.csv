4.5,"Given the right cask and a few decades to mature, grain whiskies can be fabulous. Invergordon's from the 1970s are among the best bottles you can find, and this 44-year-old Mancarella is no exception. Delightful, sweet and cereal-rich, the nose combines crème brûlée, pastries and exotic tea with cloves, cocoa butter and hints of acetone. After a dense, oily and almost rum-like arrival, pineapple, lemon zest and brown sugar merge with walnuts, mint and ginger. Quality oak spices, confectionery and grapefruit sparkle in the aftertaste. A top-notch grain!
