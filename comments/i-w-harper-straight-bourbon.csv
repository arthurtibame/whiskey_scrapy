5.0,"Wish-listed on Monday, my local shop got it on Wednesday. Such great timing, and I am very pleased with this bourbon. The usual oaky-vanilla, but with a hint of simple syrup. Toasted marshmallow on the nose turns into buttered popcorn on the palette (I'm obviously talking Jelly Belly here)."

3.0,"Nose, similar to Jack Daniels, is dominated by banana as well as vanilla.  Sweet caramel on the palate with some oak. Slightly spicy finish from the rye notes. Tasted from a sample and need to revisit. [84/100][Tasted: 7/10/15]"

2.0,Ordered a bottle off Caskers as I haven't seen this locally.  I had high hopes and really wanted this to wow me and it just never did.  I consider it a good bourbon but not a great one.  I paid $60 for this one and can say I'm one and done.  If you can get it for $30 do it.  I'd probably rank it in the high 80's.  Like an 88 but not a 94 like Distiller has it.  Tomato/Tomatoes.
2.0,"I have to concur with the ""too sweet"" sentiments here. This ""jelly belly"" of a whiskey, while certainly palatable, is too sweet and has too minimal of a finish. The proof is low enough that I feel watering it down more than a few drops would wash away the few remnants of structure and balance I can detect. I've tried to stay on board with Diageo despite their high priced Orphans and other gimmicks. This stuff makes me question whether that is wise. If the price were under 20 I'd say this is a fair deal. At $30-35 there are far better options in almost every US market. You're much better off with a liter of Weller 12 or Forester Signature 100 proof than this. Save yourself the money & excessive sweetness!"

3.0,Not a big fan of this one do not understand the rating here. Lots of alcohol on the nose some fruit with a hint of everything from wood to toffee. The taste is all over the place nothing to really note that goes into a mild burn and not much else. This was neat on ice ball it was thin and boring. Wish it would have been better but I will try in a few months and see if changes.
4.0,"Sweet and rich for sure, but still maintains the classic characteristics of a good bourbon. For its age it still has a fair bite. It is not overwhelmed by complexity, but that isn't always a bad thing. I would compare it to Eagle Rare, but a little less of a bargain."

2.0,"Nose - This odd oaky fruity mixture of pineapple, pear, and banana laffy taffy. There's a hint of vanilla in there as well as a hint of caramel rolls, not much cinnamon, slighly yeasty. Hint of black tea?
Taste - Taste when it hits your tongue is this oddly artificial spice and sweetness. The spice isn't really cinnamon, nor black pepper, nor peppers, it's just this artificial ""spice"" taste. Hint of vanilla. Tastes like a splenda sweetened oak tea.
Finish - Not much here in the finish. Lightly drying, almost like if you chewed on some dry feed corn or hay in that it's slightly sweet, but kind of bitter too. Almost like you just held a piece of balsa wood in your mouth.

4.0,"Much like thr previous reviews, I would recommend this as a intro level burbon; not to diminish the quality. It is on the sweeter end, with nice smoothness, and the flavor profiles are pretty straight foward and easy to recognize. If you, or someone else is just getting into the game of burbons and whiskeys, this would be a good one to start with. Normally I would rate this an 87-89, but its quality too price point is very nice. I would give it a 90-91; 94 is a little pumped up."
4.0,"A balanced, smooth, sipping bourbon that is a great deal for the price. When I was a kid in NYC  back in the 70s, it was the bourbon of choice of the firefighters I grew up around.  Now I.W. Harper is back and it's still a sweet deal."

4.0,"Nose is very mild, just a hint of undefinable sweetness and fruit compote before you get the essence of heat.  Not bad, but certainly underwhelming, especially when compared to a few obvious rivals such as Evan Williams Single Barrel and Elijah Craig Small Batch.  Fortunately, the palate is much livelier, opening sweet upon sweet with caramel, brown sugar, molasses and vanilla co-mingling to lead the charge.  After a few seconds, the rye influence arrives and the mint overwhelms everything else before a pleasant wave of sweetness tempered by holiday spices closes things out.  The numbing zing of clove lingers the longest, seemingly coating your lips and tongue and lasting almost a full minute after the last sip.    Very, very good whisky.  If this was in the $30 range it would be an expetional bargain. At the $40 range (when I can find it) this starts to be less appealing, especially when compared with the aforementioned EW Single Barrel and the even better Jim Beam 12yr.  Well worth the time to find it, and just enough different from my favorite bourbons to remain in my whisky rack."

5.0,"In the glass,the amber color is not as deep as expected , but nonetheless presents a pleasant hue.  A swirl reveals legs that languidly morph from thick to thin as the spirit slides down the side to meet its cohort. I nosed the glass numerous times to enjoy the layers of aromatic notes.  First, cinnamon and cloves arrive, joined next by other baking spices, which are quickly embraced by rich vanilla milkshake.  A hint of fruit dances in the background (strawberry?).  Last to the party is sweet creamed corn. 

On the palate, a little caramel sweetness is joined by the baking spices, which appear throughout. A little leather comes on the scene, along for the ride through the dryer, oaky finish.  

The dry glass smells like pipe tobacco (Borkum Riff) and dark chocolate. I didn't pick up those notes on the palate, so I will have to look for them next time I drink this pleasant bourbon. 

All in all, I was quite impressed and will definitely be sipping more of this. 93 points for 5 stars."

Proof: 82 (41%)

Bottled: The I.W. Harper Distilling Company, Tullahoma, TN

Palate: Rich, sweet, honey, hint of vanilla, hint of banana, smallest touch of cork
Finish: Short, Smooth, fruity initially, leather, oak, hint of corn 
Personal Rating: 7.75/10
Notes: I.W. Harper delivers a decently drinkable bourbon. However, for me, there was nothing really overly remarkable. I will say that the sweetness is very forward, not bad, but makes me feel like I’m drinking bourbon with honey added to it (don’t get me wrong, that isn’t the worst thing in the world). I usually like anything in which I can get a slight taste of banana in the pour (that is what brought it from 7/10 to 7.75 for me), you can pick it a little closer to the finish. As always, you know I’ll drink this neat, but you can likely benefit from a few drops of water to cut the sweetness a little and allow some of the other flavors to come forward. I think this could be an introductory bourbon to a rum drinker now that I think about it. Overall, the price isn’t bad so if you want to pick up a bottle go for it. You won’t be mad, but likely not blown away"

3.0,"Probably a 3.5, and a four for the price. Smooth bourbon, no bite, not a lot of complexity. Just solid"
3.0,"To be frank, a score of 94 on this one is unmerited. My expectations were high and this one falls flat with with a lot to be desired. It's bourbon. It's not bad but it's not that great either. After several drams, I'm still wondering what all the fuss is about. Drinking whiskey should be about the appreciation of each sip and the craftsmanship that went into it. Sipping this is a practice in tolerance. It's just not all that fun or engaging. (FWF share #9)"
4.0,"With a 5 star system, it's probably necessary to say that this is a low 4 stars as opposed to a high 4 stars. Why 4 instead of 3? Simply because this is the best mouthfeel I've ever encountered in a bourbon. It's rich, buttery, creamy, and insanely smooth - the tactile drinking experience alone is worth the price of admission. But, how's it taste? Good, but I wouldn't call this exciting. If you've ever had banoffee pie (graham crust, banana, toffee, whipped cream, all that kind of stuff), then you have a sense of the notes found here. It's a sweet, smooth bourbon that goes down crazily easy, but I get the sense that there could be a few more fireworks. On the other hand, I suppose we all need the friend who's reliably pleasant, if not a particularly interesting conversationalist."

2.0,"I tasted this in a blind comparison with Benchmark 8 as a control.  Neither smelled of vanilla or oak.  Benchmark 8 smelled like a BT product. (A positive for me).  They both tasted the same???  I knew one was different but the same notes were present.  Neither had off notes or tasted of rot-gut.  The Benchmark tasted  more of caramel, and the Harper tasted of floor wax. ( or young bourbon) See my review of Benchmark 8.  What really is striking is the high rating Harper NAS received from the pro evaluation? (Blade & Bow 90, Blanton's 89, Buffalo Trace 82... I know, from different evaluators) I am no expert but I know what I like. I also know that I agree with most when it comes to top shelf bourbon.  This is NOT.  This ""might"" receive 3.5 stars if it were $12.95/bottle in NC because of the absence of off notes.  Unfortunately it is $35 / bottle.  Again, see my Benchmark review. I am fair to cheaper bourbon. Benchmark, Early Times, Ancient Age do not pretend they're something they're not.  Harper NAS apparently believes it belongs with other bourbons in the mid $30 range. Sorry...
After rinsing out both glasses, I threw a few distilled rocks in one and poured a bit of Knob Creek... I could not go to bed without a reminder of what Oak, and Vanilla are supposed to taste like in quality bourbon...for $32!
I would like to give 1 star, but I can't since it doesn't taste bad or swill.  It's just a pretender and I don't suffer that well.  Does anyone want the rest of the bottle???"

2.5,"I really enjoy the 15 yr old expression of IW Harper. At the sub $60 price point I can find it for it's one of the better values in Bourbon for it's age and delicate taste profile! So having had that one of course I have been curious to try out the Lil Brother. The trouble is it's a bit of a challenge to find either a pour and with the bottle going for just $17 cheaper that the 15 yr old in my market, I never saw the value in buying this bottle over it. 
I had actually hit this Whiskey bar in the hopes of trying the new Blood Oath Pact 5. They did indeed have but wanted $30 for a 1.5 oz pour. That was a hard pass for me as the bottle will run me $90. I then noticed this one, and at $9 for 2oz I felt the time had come to finally try it! On to the pallette. 
Upon entry you immidiately know this is a completely different Bourbon to the 15 yr old. That one enters softly with great botanical, deep barrel char notes. This one is straight down the middle sweet Bourbon. Honey, vanilla and toffee dominate. As you move to the mid pallette the oak becomes more evident with a slight spice and some leather and tobacco leading to a short to medium oak driven finish. It's actually pretty robust for the low proof (82 proof). It's a tasty pour to be sure and if I was at a friend's house and this was his house Bourbon, I would happily drink it. Would I buy it? In short no. 
Too many better options at this $35-$40 price point. Diageo clearly sought to create a product that appealed to the masses and in that vein they have succeeded. For anyone seeking any complexity this will be a big disspiontment to you. 
So in summation, if you get a chance to get a cheap pour of this try it. If you see a bottle, pass every time (unless you are new to Bourbon and are looking for a simple dram with a premium feel).
As a side note I have no idea what the ""expert"" reviewer was tasting while rating this a 94! I mean that is GTS level score for what at best is a well executed but very simple Whiskey!
Cheers all!"

Overall... I will definitely come back to this KSB due to its reasonable price and the enjoyable flavors it has to offer. Drinking this neat due to the lower proof was a good way to go and I'll be coming back for this as long as I have it available. Definite home bar necessity.."

Both the 15 year (a personal fave) and this blend, at less than half the price, are amazing bourbons. Sometimes you put something to your lips and it simply elevates you. You feel that your Life is better and you're more able to enjoy it. That kind of whiskey sippin' doesn't come along all that often, at least not for me. This Bourbon has just the right amount of burn and mist when taken neat. The sweetness on the nosing is tasted in just the right amount in the mouth. There are no funny or odd tastes anywhere along the way from scent to swallow to interfere with the enjoyment. The finish is moderately long and slowly moves into one taste after another, with strong vanilla cream always present. For me, this whiskey is filled with sweet memories of days gone by and reminds me of my first tastes as a kid when the adults would let us take tiny sips of  their drinks through the little straw stirrers. Sitting up on the bar stools in the 51 Club, the Chesapeake Ranch Club, the Quonset Hut ...ahhh, youth! Where did you go?

Harper bottles are always distinctive and this design itself is a standout and befitting the smooth sipping contents. When one finds this kind of Classic taste and drinking experience at this price level, one is justified in wondering just why we continue to pursue exotically priced offerings.

 I love this kind of whiskey and will nurse this bottle until it is empty and then place it on the whiskey pantheon shelf above the bar. No wonder the Japanese fell in love with this brand. Great to see it back in the States again.

I am heavily reminded of banana pudding with spice.  There are definitely creamy milky characteristics with clove and anise. 

I honestly think this is quite interesting, but I personally just can't get behind it.  I think the amount of anise is off-putting."

2.75,Nose is kinda fun with lemon pastry notes. Palate is very thin with more lemon and some kind of spice (cardamom?). Over all not too exciting. Quite refreshing over ice though; especially as the ice melts a bit. Not worth $35

4.5,This is eagle rare but smoother with a fruity banana finish very well done at 33 dollars.  Let it breathe or hit with some water and you get orange wood banana with a solid popcorn slick on the roof of your mouth. Well done.
3.5,"This one looks thicker in the glass

The nose is fairly sweet with vanilla, caramel, slight banana, and light oak.

The palate has a very creamy mouthfeel. Not super oily per se, but creamy is the best way I can describe it. Very noticeable.
Not overly sweet. Lots of vanilla and some oak. Not a ton of flavors poke out on this one but it is very pleasant and welcoming.

The finish is on the shorter side of medium, and has little warmth going down, but also very comforting.

I like this one. I wished there was a little more depth knowing that this is blended with young barrels all the way up 20 year barrels."

3.25,"I.W. Harper is not a label I knew much about. I had seen the 15 year in its beautiful bottle and thought, ""There must be something wonderful in there,"" but the brand had not appeared in reviews, discussions, or top lists that I had seen. The fact is, other than the 15 year, I wasn't sure what else, if anything, was even in the I.W. Harper line. This has a lot to do with the fact that the brand was pulled from the U.S. market in the mid-90s and sold primarily in Europe and Asia, only returning stateside in the last few years. I strolled into a neighborhood liquor store the other day and was delighted to see that they had I.W. Harper Straight Bourbon Whiskey. While the bottle itself didn't look quite so nice as the 15 year, the label and color scheme definitely put out an air of sophistication. At only $32, I thought it worth purchasing as the first bourbon I would own with no prior knowledge of its reputation or attributes.

The Harper has a nice dark golden brown color and comes in at a sure to be smooth 82 proof. The nose is gentle with vanilla and oak, maybe some corn, and not much else. There is no age statement, other than it being a straight bourbon, but it smells like a young bourbon. The mouthfeel is smooth and not quite dry, but almost. The palate has a citrusy sweet profile with orange, vanilla, light brown sugar, and a nice cinnamon bite on the back of the tongue. The finish is moderate with oak and leather standing out along with a lingering sweetness. This is a good bourbon that I can sip neat or use in a cocktail. A higher proof or more time in the barrel, or both, would bring this bourbon to the next level, but as it stands this is just a pretty good bourbon and a pretty good price. I would say that while this label is not a must-have, it is worth trying and certainly makes me think the 15 year is probably outstanding."

3.25,"My initial review of this bourbon was not objective, it was tainted and slanted by the poor beer selection which was consumed prior to this tasting - hence I felt obligated to delete that review and provide a completely impartial impression of this whiskey, one that is honestly deserved. 

Although this is a very good blended bourbon I still believe the Distiller rating is pretty generous. The nose is pretty weak, however the body is really well balanced and pleasant, sweet, smooth and soft. This is a very easy drinking bourbon, a lot of banana, vanilla, and if you try hard enough you might pick up coconut and nutmeg spice in the body. Although the body is pretty thin the finish lingers nicely, some spice and clove but it’s not hot... the finish is really quite nice. 

Even though I thoroughly enjoyed this bourbon and would gladly have another if it was offered, it simply lacks the depth and character found in so many others at this price. While you could serve this confidently to the most discriminating guest, there is nothing here that will “wow” them, they will enjoy it but they won’t say “hey this is really good, what is it?” I really liked this bourbon, I just wanted to like it more than I do."

4.5,"[3.25.2020] Welcome to the new era, where the word ""Coronavirus"" enables daydrinkers 24/7. I'm loving it. We're starting to clean out my liquor cabinet and I found this beauty from a few years back. Believe it or not, I paid about $20 for it (don't hate me). So I felt shameless about dedicating it as the Old Fashioned bottle when my little came home from Madison. 

But not before snagging a sip... This whiskey is predictable and I like it. Wasn't surprised to find out it's in the Weller family when I went to enter the review. It feels rich/full-bodied on the tongue and I pick up more sweet leathery flavor than the pro reviewer - almost like sniffing a brand new deerhide wallet. I don't find it spicy but I've also eaten Jalopenos for breakfast. Harper's is an easy, smooth sipper that you shouldn't be ashamed to mix in an old-school drink because it is a steady staple for anything you want to make."

2.75,"I W Harper Straight Bourbon
82 proof.   73% Corn 18% Rye 9% Barley

Nose: classic Kentucky bourbon. Very rounded and soft. Corn sweet, grain mash, blackberry jam, butterscotch, vanilla, cedar board, oak barrel, white chocolate fudge. The nose unfolds nicely in rich layers. Nothing smells out of place or incongruent. 
Palate: a little thin on entry like you would expect with the proof. Despite that there is a velvety richness to it. Not very oily. Fruity sweet transitions quickly to barrel sour and spice with a touch of char. Corn, blackberry, caramel, ginger, white pepper, smokey char, sour oak, a faint minty note. 
Finish: brief, peppery leather, drying, slight oak. 
There is definitely some older whiskey in the blend here that really rounds this out and adds some rich oak character. Overall its a gentle easy sipper and would be a decent gateway to classic kentucky bourbon. Well worth the $28 price tag and feels a touch classier. Despite the evidence of older whiskey there’s not much complexity. It is well rounded and nothing spikey. The nose out-punches the palate and the oak dominates the mid palate. It really transitions through very quickly. In all honestly for the money I would probably take Wild Turkey or Woodford over this. Nothing really stands out for a crowded market segment."

4.0,"Okay I have to admit, and just shoot me now with a Daniel Boone musket, I'm a KY boy, born and raised, but I just don't enjoy bourbon as much as scotch.  Perhaps it's the new oak spiciness, or maybe it's the high corn composition, or the heat of the KY weather that speeds the fermentation, but the nose on just about any bourbon really puts me off.  That said, I have consumed plenty of Maker's Mark, 101, and Buffalo Trace without grumbling.  It's just I *prefer* heavily, or completely, malted whiskies.  Now that I have my Catholic guilt confessed, I will admit that this bottle is very, very smooth.  Which is about the best I can hope for in a bourbon.  Do I grade on a curve with my bourbons?  Yes.  I just can't bring myself not to give a great product a good score if it is one I can actually say I enjoy.  But, and here comes the confessional again, if I have a 4.0 bourbon on the shelf and a 4.0 scotch, I'll rarely reach for the former."
