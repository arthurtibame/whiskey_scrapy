2.0,"I'm not sure it's worth the price it commands.  It's way to simple and lacks the complexity of similar products in that price range.  Not bad...but, for it's price...can do much better.   It may improve with age, who knows...just seemed too young, with too much wood influence and not enough depth"

3.75,"Interesting! A nice nose, with vanilla and oak. The palate brings some vanilla and caramel.  There's a fair amount of heat, but it's more of a persistent heat than a flameout.  It tastes like a young whiskey - not full or oily. But it doesn't have some of the harshness I find with some young drams.  Perhaps the solera process mellows it a bit.   I don't think I'd buy a bottle, and if you prefer a more full taste and texture, it may not be for you.  But I'll keep an eye on Hillrock - there's some good stuff going on here that might benefit significantly with a few more years in the barrel."

3.25,"Room temperature / Glencairn glass / no water or ice added.  Barrel 50.

The nose just hits me with young whiskey.  And oak.  I know.  I don't even believe what I just wrote, but that's what I'm getting.

The palate has more alcohol in it that I would have expected, but there's vanilla / caramel too.  Maybe a bit of orange mid-way.  After the initial heat you're left with sweetness like honey.

The finish is the best part, IMHO.  It lingers a bit with a nice coating in your mouth, honey and gentle, soft spices.  Still getting the vanilla and a caramel hint in there too."
3.5,"Medium long finish, lots of fruit, medium sweet. Some wood sugars. Pleasant on the whole. Crazy heavy bottle."
3.5,very bright... the sherry barrel aging is immediately recognizable... reminds me of Whistlepig rye.

3.25,Fresh and tasty. There was a little finish that lingers that I didn’t like otherwise a solid bourbon.
4.25,"I have yet to try something from Hillrock that I didn’t like. Although they have a peated single malt that I’ll probably stay away from :-). The Solera aged bourbon was full of flavor and very enjoyable to drink on the rocks. So far I have had their Rye and single malt, both scored very high on my pallet."

3.25,"Tasted at room temperature / Denver & Liely Whisky glass / no water or ice added. 

92.6 proof.   

Note: this bottle has been in my collection and open for a long time.  Likely 2 years or more.  I'm sure this will affect the tasting to some degree.

The nose has pear, cherry, and vanilla, and a little alcohol to it.  Quite pleasant overall.  Worth nosing a few times to get the full experience.  The aromas definitely triggered my taste buds.  Funny side note, when I first nosed this and tried to identify the first word that came to mind, it was ""bourbon.""  As in - the bourbon characteristics you get from a bourbon infused maple syrup, or bourbon ice cream, bourbon coffee, etc.  It's what bourbon smells like when it is the flavoring ingredient in something else.

On the palate, this shows a little more ""young whiskey"" than I was expecting based on the nose.  Orange, cinnamon, vanilla and a little hint of a ginger-like bite... Maybe it's the rye influencing this?  It's interesting that this is very subtle on the palate without being boring.  In fact, it's somewhat complex.  The only other whiskey I remember coming across as this subtle yet still clearly layered and complex was Elmer T. Lee.  These don't taste alike, but the layering is similar.  For all this, I can't say I'm in love with the flavor.  It's good.  It's interesting.  It's not great.  Young is forward.

The finish is pleasant and floral.  It lasts.  Getting a little vanilla, orange or orange zest in the finish that I wasn't really expecting."
4.5,Single barrel aged in cognac barrels
4.75,Smells very oaky & spicy. Smoooth and clean taste that carries nicely in the finish.
4.75,"Get some nice oak and spice on the nose / sweetness, peppery and sweet on the palate, pleasant drawn out finish of fruits"

4.0,A lot of sweetness on the nose and the palette. Getting some butterscotch flavors. Semi long finish that ends slightly bitter. Fair bit of Kentucky hug. Low proof is noticeable.
4.5,"full,sweet and no rough edges...excellent,but don't know if its profile justifies its cost[$90]."

3.25,"Disclaimer:

Based on the official review, I do not believe this is the correct bottle, but I am unsure. My bottle looks identical to this one, and there is a label that states it was finished in sherry casks. However, written by hand on “barrel no:” is “Sauternes-23”. Not a wine guy, but I’m pretty sure Sauternes does not equal sherry. This bottle was marketed to me as a Sauternes finish, and after having a handful of these, I am convinced this is in fact a Sauternes and not a sherry influence in my mouth hole. End disclaimer.

Hillrock versus Boone County 1833.
Sauternes Cask Finish Bracket.
Winner to face Jefferson’s.

Full competition recap:
In Sherry finish bracket, Wild Turkey Revival beat out Joseph Magnus, Noble Oak, and Rabbit Hole to be in the final 5. Port, Rum, and Red Wine brackets still TBD.

I literally had to turn down the lights to do this blind taste test. There’s a drastic difference in color between BC and Hillrock, Hillrock being more in line with the other Sauternes cask finishes I’ve tried. Flavor-wise, it wasn’t hard to pick out BC. That is one delicious cask finish. Ultimately, BC had more to offer, and progressed on to the next round. Hillrock needs some work, to be sure.

The nose on Hillrock does not give away its cask finish. It’s very plain, and I mean that is a bad way. I did not come here to drink a plain bourbon. Where did the Sauternes go? For lack of better descriptors, Hillrock smells like young whiskey. There’s an industrial smell (I’ll go with rubber gloves tonight) that is reminiscent of the Journeyman line. I didn’t know what Solera aging meant, so I looked it up. Now this nose makes sense. It’s not as harsh as a lot of young whiskies, because it’s mixed with sourced MGP. In my opinion, that’s kind of like pissing in lemonade and trying to take credit for how sweet your piss tastes.
There’s a hint of raisin behind the industrial scent, but it’s almost impossible to suss out.

Body hits smoothly, before the harshness sets in. That first hit is the only place you’re going to find your Sauternes influence. There green grapes, sugar, raisin, and vanilla. It’s a nice touch that, unfortunately, is far too fleeting.

Finish hits early with the harsh, acidic bite of a young whiskey. It’s hard to get much in the way of flavor, because I’m honestly more in survival mode. If I had to toss out something, I’d say licorice and tea leaves. But then something awesome happens. The harshness fades away, and on your molars and sides of mouth, a pure sweetness comes back. I get tangerine, lemon, cane sugar, and more grapes.

So the Sauternes was there after all, amidst the harshness introduced by the Solera “aging” process. Not of fan of that on principle, but I understand the practical value there. This entry wasn’t enough to make me never try Hillrock again, and for young whiskey, I think they’ve accomplished something far better than Journeymen, Cleveland, and many of the other young distilleries that charge you three times the cost of a WT101 for an inferior product. I will likely let Hillrock earn it’s stripes on someone else’s tongue, and check back when they’ve switched to actually aging, the good old fashioned way. Will not rebuy at this time."

3.5,"Nose is pretty much all fruit, small bit of rye spice and some vanilla. Not much of the typical cinnamon, caramel bourbon notes I typically expect. Taste is similar, all fruit from that sherry aging with rye spice on the finish. Decent stuff, but not worth the high price. I think you’re paying mostly for the beautiful packaging."
4.5,Peat. Oak. Front like a whiskey back like a bourbon.
