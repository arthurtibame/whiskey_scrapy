3.0,"Interesting flavor profile. Unique blend of spices. Almost drinks like a high proof pre bottled cocktail. I use this one a lot in the summer when I am entertaining my cocktail loving family and friends. Great for a two ingredient mixed drink since it brings so many flavors aboard. Great with cola, lemon lime soda, or orange soda (tastes just like a creamsicle)."
