4.0,"[4.6.2015] Gavin shared the tail end of a bottle with me when I stopped in to chat about a fundraiser with NHB. This got a bad rep from people early on but I think it's because those pansies are scared of the proof or the price (both formidable), including a harsh review from the only other note preceding mine. 

First whiff is strong cask with a hint of a sweet red wine buried in the dish pile. Taste confirms the initial assessment. Rich wheat whiskey mixes with dry sherry cask. If this wasn't served at cask strength I couldn't like it as much. But at 102 proof this is a fine piece to keep around, and the bottling releases will just keep getting older and better."
2.0,"The oloroso adds a very nice touch, but unfortunately this whiskey isn't old enough to shine. Very spirit-y, and aside from the sherry sheen, very simple. Wheat, a touch of char, red fruit, and burning on the nose, with a coat of acetone covering the whole experience. Would be much better with another two years' time."
