4.0,"Smooth, subtle"
3.75,"Mild rye spice on the nose, and follows with a mix of black pepper and maple syrup. Definitely a unique whiskey - plenty fine to sip on. Not my favorite, but enjoyed it, nonetheless."

4.25,"Sweeter than most eyes, offers a very smooth finish with oak notes. More of a unique rye compared to most I have had so some of the notes are hard to pick up, but as a whole, a fantastic pour"

3.5,"Tasting at VA ABC store.  Plastic taster, neat.  After the regular Roundstone Rye, this shows much more depth, more nuance, with vanilla, and herbs cutting through the straight rye bite.  Much better than the base.  6/21/19"
3.0,nice smooth rye whiskey. 92 proof was better
5.0,YES PLEASE GIMME THAT ROUNDSTONE
2.5,"Taste:  Neat in glen cairn glass, then 3 drops of water.

Nose (2.5):  Very sweet and doughy.  Almost medicinal and pungent.  Very yeasty and fruity.  Nose kind of turned me off.

Palate: (3.25) Bready and sweet with some rye and a hint of marshmallow.  Some candycorn is on the back end.  Better than the nose, but not my favorite rye whiskey.

Finish (2.0):  Some spice comes through but that sweetness from the nose overwhelms the finish.  The fruity yeast is overwhelming.  Reminds me of a pizza kitchen.

Overall:  I was disappointed overall.  Too sweet, almost medicinally so on the nose.  The taste improved a bit but still too yeasty."
