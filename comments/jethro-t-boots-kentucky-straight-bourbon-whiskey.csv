2.75,"Jethro T Boots Bourbon, no age listed so must be 4 years minimum by law as a straight bourbon from Kentucky. Legacy Distilling Co. (Sazerac), private label for CVS.
Aroma: smells very similar to jack, on the fruity side. Taste: Slightly smiliar to jack, sweet/fruity up frony, apple notes, some charred oak on the back end. Very minor ethanol notes on the finish. Plenty smooth. Cost ~ 8-9 bucks plus tax Grade: C+
very decent for the price."

3.5,"Has notes of vanilla, toffee, caramel, and light oak. No noticeable burn and a hint of sweetness on the aftertaste. Not bad at all for a “bottom shelf” bourbon."
