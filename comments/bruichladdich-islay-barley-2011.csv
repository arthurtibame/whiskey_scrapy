3.5,"An adventure. I can taste the salty, smoky, dense, soil that the barley was grown in even though the scotch itself is not peated. I get black pepper along with white-fleshed fruit like peach and apricot, and it's slightly buttery, giving off a peaches and cream vibe. It is certainly young; it still has some jagged edges that are rounded off in more mature whiskeys. Not necessarily a bad thing. It has more richness than the Pulteney, although I think these two whiskeys are spiritually connected."

3.75,"Bruichladdich 2011 Islay Barley

This whisky is an opus to younger malt and cask selection. Just vibrant and bracing. Puts me in the mind of standing on a mountain trail at the end of winter/first of spring. The sun feels glorious and warm but the breeze is still brisk and bracing. The first buds are busting on the maple trees and life is returning to the dormant earth. The sky is clear and you can see for days. Such is this whisky.  
Nose: vibrant, fresh, fruit and grain forward. zesty young malt, stone fruits, melon, papaya, tropical fruit medley,   chalky mineral, citrus (five-alive), candied lemon, vanilla custard, apples with orange zest, there is a touch of brine mingled throughout. 
Palate: this just hits all the right spots. It starts immediately syrup sweet and transitions to a citrus sour before the briny notes take over with a nice explosion of oak spice. Honeyed malt, lemon candy, salted melon, white grapefruit, canned peaches, dried apricots, ginger and cracked pepper. 
Finish: seasalt, creamy vanilla, ginger and peach...finishes like a pinot grigio with bracing minerality and stone fruit. Sweet tobacco leaf. It all lingers for a while and you’re better for it."
4.0,The first word that comes to mind for this one is robust. It’s malty and thick. It’s sweet and has a nice vein of vanilla running through the middle. In a lot of ways it’s very reminiscent of a bourbon.

4.25,"Sweet but not too much so

Can taste the similarity to the classic laddie. To me it tastes similar except without the brine.

Someone described it as a whisky to give to beer lovers, seems very apt. Like a whisky version of a lager."

4.0,The nose carries fragrant lemon and honey. The tasting brings out warm toffee and caramel like in an olde fashioned candy store. A lovely finish that leaves the taste of crisp apples.
3.5,"An interesting combination of spicy and pepper and creamy and fruity. Smokey, briney nose with some fruits. Taste starts with some vanilla, fruit, before giving way to major pepper and spice. A fun drink, definitely feel the sharpness of it being young. Finish is smooth and sweet."

5.0,"Beginning is all vanilla and flowers, then you start to taste a very subdued brine and black pepper taste and the finish is a perfect combination of light bourbon barrel spice and the sweetness of the wines . Definitely worth trying"
