3.25,"This is a Bourbon that has already become a unicorn and is now reselling for north of $800 on the secondary market. So when I had the opportunity to get a pour for a somewhat reasonable price I had to give it a try! Let's dive into some of the details that make this limited offering of EH Taylor so unique:

Like all Taylor's it uses the BT #1 Mashbill and replaces Rye with the Amaranth grain

While an NAS release, per the Distillery it's aged for over 10 years

It's a BiB release and highly allocated

Let's dive into the tasting notes:

On the palette it's a somewhat thin mouthfeel but very rich notes of butterscotch and toffee apple are immediately present. Next the oak appears with some spice that is a bit drying. Cherries are also evident with a really distinct grain taste that is odd and I had a hard time moving past. Similar to corn but not like the corn meal note you get with young Bourbon, literally like corn grain. This eventually tapers off to a medium oak driven and astringent finish. 

Now BT succeeded in providing a very unique and pleasant drinking experience. This will be one some people will absolutely love and others may seriously dislike due to its unique profile. I fall somewhere in the middle. I enjoyed it for the most part but the astringent finish and that grain note where not my cup of tea. I am really happy to have experienced it and think it's worth springing for a pour, but I personally wouldn't buy a whole bottle (assuming you are drinking it) even at the SRP of $70 let alone the crazy secondary pricing. 

Cheers All!"

4.5,Loved it. Tastes like bourbon with an oaty or grainy overtone. Really good. Not as different as some people claim...to me anyway.

2.5,Too much Cherry. I almost spit it out.  I'm glad I didnt pay for this.
4.0,"Taste like amaranth grain. Take a big whiff of a bag of amaranth flour and that's what you got. Bit of medicinal cherry, old leather, black pepper. Thin mouthfeel"

4.0,"Good, not great. Cherry, vanilla and a nice crisp finish. I've had eht sib in the same league though."
3.5,Neat. Still trying to wrap my head around it. Big medicinal cherry notes. Almost Robotussin like. This is strange.
3.75,Not really sure on this one. Colonel EH Taylor makes some really good stuff but I would prefer single barrel over this. Nose is sweet with notes of cinnamon and dark fruit. Not really getting a lot on the taste. Maybe some small notes of vanilla. After adding a little water getting vanilla in addition to apple and cinnamon. If I find a bottle at MSRP I would probably buy but wouldnt overpay for this.

4.5,"Nose: Sweet cherry, spices, cloves, old leather, wood shavings. 

Taste: sweet, then spicy, then hot, cherries and apples, brown sugar, slight heavy cream or horchata. 

Experience: hard to find a clear experience for me. It's an armchair bourbon for sure but a warm and cozy armchair, with some cider and cinnamon sticks. 

Was hoping I wouldn't like this, as it is impossible to find and a limited release. But damn, it's good. There are far cheaper and more accessible bourbons that come pretty close, but it stands up next to The Buffalo Trace Antique collection and other great whiskies."

4.5,This is very nice.  A unique mash bill leads to a distinct finish. One of our tasters likened the finish to watermelon jolly rancher.

4.75,"Nose- Caramel, pineapple, vanilla, bright orange, light oak

Palate- Chewy Caramel, raspberries, spiced vanilla, tropical fruits, chocolate chip cookie dough

Finish- Long, chewy finish with notes of tropical fruits, cookie dough and black pepper spice 

Wanted to go into this hating it, but god damn this is good. Nice tropical fruits on the nose and palate. There’s also a unique chocolate chip cookie dough taste to it on the end of the palate and finish, which I fine delicious and not something you find every day. I just wish this bottle wasn’t 750 dollars...."

So I did Greek Kabobs and in that thought I was like why not open this unicorn up as well.

E.H. Taylor Jr. 
Amaranth Grain of the Gods

Amaranth grain is most likened to wheat, and was once a staple of the Aztecs, used in numerous food items. They also used the grain to form images of their gods during the sacred month of Huitzilopochitli, and then at the end of the month ate them in order to take in the gods, which explains the origins of this bourbon's name

Release Date: July 2019
ABV: 50%
Age: NAS (Over 10 years per the company press release)
Mash-Bill: Buffalo Trace Mashbill #1 that replaces rye with amaranth as the flavoring grain - corn, amaranth, and malted barley)
Price: $70 (2019) to 1200.00 secondary 

Nose:
Cherry 🍒 bomb at first than takes a quick turn to fall baking spices, dark chocolate and seasoned oak come together in a rich, fragrance. The aroma is incredible with the first pour and seemed to even get better with time sitting. It’s intensity of this can go for days. Nevertheless the aroma remained complex, inviting, and most interesting with a unique almost like it was barrel in a wine cask just before release. 

Front:
A light mouthfeel is noticeable, but this is countered with a first a zing of spices of flavors. The wine or sherry note is the zing, honey, toasted caramel, summer floral notes, and touch of of smoke almost scotch like characteristics. It’s a freak of nature how this kinda has a slight undertone of blended of a high proof whiskey/scotch.

Back/Finish:
Sweet cigar tease at first, leather Christmas spice quickly developed as well. The zing in the front becomes bitter along with a tannic note. It’s the lingering beauty feels that it moves to fast and doesn’t last too long.

Buffalo Trace has many experiments in the works, and in recent years has chosen to honor E.H. Taylor by releasing limited experimental variations of the brand. Attributing this to Taylor’s persona, Buffalo Trace has stated it “honors Taylor’s enduring spirit of innovation and commitment to exceptional whiskey.” 

The tenth unique release in the Taylor lineup, Amaranth is the sixth special release and the second to use a unique mashbill. However, while Four Grain had four grains in the mashbill, they still remained the most commonly used grains - corn, rye, wheat, and malted barley. Amaranth is the first of its kind, with no other previous bourbon using the grain in its mashbill. This is surprising considering distilleries like Corsair have released Grainiac (9 grain mashbill) done a review one and Insane in the Grain (12 grain mashbill) whiskeys - none of which used amaranth. 

This is a unique dram from the gods and damn lucky to be able to get a bottle to review.

Cheers!"

3.5,The amaranth was wierd I wanna say it's like a rice wine flavor. Similar to the original with a funky after taste I would stick to the original or the rye.

4.25,Good and full of flavor with a long lasting finish.
3.75,"The color is a dark, glowing amber and it leaves heavy oils all around the glass with each movement. The nose features plenty of mild baking spices along with sweet notes of creamy vanilla, caramel and brown sugar, while hints of oak mix with a more floral, mildly spearmint note. The nose carries over into the palate, with it coating the mouth in the creamy sweetness, while a chili spiciness comes in a gradual wave at the end. The finish has the mouth still feeling the spiciness while you feel touches of the sweeter notes gently fading alongside a bit of oak. The amaranth seems to add a bit of hotness to what you would normally find with E.H. Taylor, making for a minimal impact compared to other offerings in the Taylor line."
