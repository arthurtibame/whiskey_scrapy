3.75,"Typical rye nose but with a sweetness. 0 spice or burn on the finish which is surprising for a rye. Definitely can see the “bourbon lovers rye” characterization. Very very sweet finish that is smooth with rich butter and caramel on the tongue. A real headscratcher with the mind. Is it a rye, is it a bourbon, is it a rye trying to be a bourbon???!!"

3.25,"The nose is fresh, clean, with spice and a hint of fingernail polish remover. On the palate, this definitely seems richer than the 2017 batch. The turpentine note carries over from the nose, but it's velvety and oily, with lots of spice, with black pepper kicking in at the end. Sweetness appears after a while. 2/22/19"

4.0,This is an interesting rye which I would describe as a rye that isn’t a rye.
