4.0,"Earthy, herbally and slightly zesty on the nose. Mellow and hay-like on the palate off to a long and grain-zesty finish. A slightly complex, powerful but very enjoyable drink."

4.0,"There are only two distilleries (right now) in the island of Orkney, in the north of Scotland. One is Highland Park, famous for its viking culture, and the other one is Pernod Ricard's Scapa, a very gentle whisky. 

This is the review for one of their two core expressions, Glansa. The other one is Skiren which i have reviewed in the past along with the 16yo, which is now discontinued.

Bottled at 40%, glansa is the mildly peated version of scapa; 

On the nose: dim Peat, Heather, Toffee, Almonds and Butterscotch. 

On the palate: Orange and chocolate. Dulce de leche. Vanilla. And a sweet called melcocha, which is a type of hard taffy that tastes like vanilla and dulce de leche mixed presented in an unbreakable stick that chips your teeth.

Aftertaste has Clove, a very gentle peat, some Saltiness and maybe a sweet dim hint from what came of the palate. Short finish.

Overall, this is a nice whisky. Good for the price. 82 over 100 is a proper score for it."

4.0,"I keep being impressed by Scapa. I'd been dying to try this one for a while, and...well, it was worth ordering a bottle when making my annual purchase of the whisky Advent calendar. This is peated, but not in the traditional sense - it spends time in a finishing cask that previously held heavily peated whisky. The nose is full and fruity - loads of orchard and stone fruits, rounded out with vanilla, a whiff of smoke, and a tiny hint of sea air. The palate enters with a bright, fresh fruitiness with vanilla creme, and then that smoke starts to creep in like fog rolling in off the water. It's very nicely balanced, and the Scapa fruit-vanilla-sea spray profile goes well with the light peat."

2.75,"Initial peatiness, hints of cinnamon and spice, continued smokiness, briny with a lingering shallow caramel note.  Thin, grassy, alcohol forward.  Enjoyable but the taste does not measure up to the pricetag."

3.0,"Fairly smooth with heather honey, sweet stone fruit, and a light soft plume of peat smoke. A little ethanol bite but decent for the price. $84 in Ontario."

2.5,"This is a difficult review because I've tasted this twice and it was totally different each time.

I first tried it at the distillery in September 2017, and found it competent and agreeable, if not outstanding. It struck me as being essentially the same distillate as Scapa Skiren, but given maturation in ex-peaty whisky barrels to cover it with a veneer of peat. I'm not convinced that this is anything other than a gimmick, but the whisky was, as I said, competent.

The peat arose only in the late development and finish rather like a warm blanket enfolding everything, and was quite different to the character of malts that are actually produced from barley saturated with peat smoke.

However, the bottle I recent bought locally is, to put it mildly, rubbish. I wouldn't even give it one star. Either this whisky doesn't travel well (which I find hard to believe) or else it was a bad bottle (loose cork or something) or else it was actively tempered with.

It had virtually no nose, palate or finish , and came across like a whisky that was diluted down to about 25% strength with straight ethanol. I don't believe that this is what has actually happened, so I'm going with the ""just a dud bottle"" explanation. In any respect, it was a disaster.  I do know that the whisky is capable of more, so I'm giving it an honorary rating of right on average, but I wouldn't recommend it.

  ""Average"" : 2.5 stars"
