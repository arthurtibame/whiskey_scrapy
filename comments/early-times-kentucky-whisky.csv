2.0,"Been drinking Early Times Kentucky Whiskey in our Manhattans for 10 years or so. Lately, the whiskey tastes more like the neutral spirit than the whiskey. It is affordable but it has become dull and lacks the usual depth. May try 1 more bottle or just move on.Thanks for the good years but u have changed oh once smooth one."

2.0,"Sharply acerbic spirit is the big hit on the nose. Also has hints of bourbony corn and oak. Thin and watery.

The body is thin and watery as well, and the sharp alcohol stings pretty hard at first. Very young bourbon notes: corn, oak, some vanilla. Overwhelming at first and then the finish is so brief it's gone before you know it."

1.0,"Such a sweet, cloying taste you'd swear it was ready mixed with cola. As if it's designed specifically for that. Such a superficial, candy-like vanilla flavour; completely, entirely empty."

2.0,"Soft spoken this is, but you won't be after a few glasses of it. Soft barrel notes and a dirty water shade. I'd drink this on ice all night long. But add a lemon and lime wedge to 7 fingers on ice, and this is a perfect cheap patio sipper. I call this the ""Ohio River"".  Rock on, Sloopy, rock on."

4.0,very smooth. the sweetness hits you at first then the slight spice and vanilla finish it off. this is the perfect everyday whiskey if you don't want to ponder too much about what you are drinking.

2.0,"To buy such an accessible 750ml bottle for under $12, this is pretty decent. It's not amazing, but for the price, it'll please even a novice whiskey drinker. Pretty sweet, pretty mellow. Not a lot to it, but for the price, it'd be just as good neat as it would be as a go-to, super cheap mixer."

4.0,"This is my go to whisky. Early Times puts on no airs, has your basic vanilla overtones & some faint woodiness,and at $15.99 for a half gallon how could you go wrong."
5.0,Well done Early Times a good solid whiskey. Not to harsh and not too weak in my humble opinion...just right!

3.0,"always on the lookout for cheap drinkability, I find this the same as a decade ago --- tasty and rough. 
good nose. yes, absent of depth and richness, yes, but not simple and simpleminded, and not unpleasant. sweet and with a bit of complexity. 
if it were not rough (and it also looks light in color) it would be something sippable straight, in a pinch. 
like benchmark, almost, which is a real bourbon with only roughness at the finish as its drawback."

2.0,"I always thought bad whiskey would taste harsh, but this made me realize that bad whiskey just tastes watered down.  I can only compare it to Jack Daniels which is slightly better.  There's flavor at first. Then the rest of the drink tastes like a whiskey/water and I drink whiskey neat."
3.25,"Vanilla, sweet, some alcohol at the end. On the rocks, nice drink, inexpensive so all the more reason to it to have around."

2.5,"Incredible for the price. More “bite” and simultaneously more sweetness than a higher end American oak whiskey, but it’s a great deal."
2.5,"Mini bottle poured neat into a Glencairn at home.  Golden color.  Nose has lots of baking spices with some popcorn at the tail.  Fairly pleasant, actually.  Taste is spiced bread, with some vanilla, and then that popcorn comes back into play.  Not as nice as the aroma, but still not unpleasant overall.  Not particularly good, but then not particularly bad, and better than I expected.  6/8/19"
2.0,vodka with artificial bourbon flavoring and nail polish remover.

2.5,"Appearance: The color was a caramel syrup amber hue. Thin and very oily legs griped the glass interior for all they were worth.

Nose: On the nose, a heavy caramel note hit first, then notes of nail polish remover, oak wood shavings, and peanuts. 

Taste: The palate started out with a note of cinnamon sugar then a harshness that reminded me of Hot Tamales candy. There were notes of orange rind and cherry in there too. If you were to take too big a gulp, much like myself I’d be willing to wager you’d experience a burn and a bad case of “the willies”

Finish: There was a medium lasting finish after those initial shivers then a hard to describe musty yet fresh aftertaste.

Thoughts: Overall, this whiskey was not bad. It was a bit harsh, but in a kind of rugged way. I think as a mixer for sure it would be great, but as a sipper I won’t be asking for seconds. Brown-Forman, thanks for this product and its long history. I do hope it continues for a long time in the hands of its fans! Cheers!"

2.5,"I am about to finish a bottle of Early Times and this is not a bad whiskey and a good deal for the price. For a whiskey that is about $10 a bottle if it is drinkable at all then this is a winner. I do not place this against W. L. Weller or E. H. Taylor but as a ""well"" whiskey or mixer, it is outstanding. When I sipped this neat it was rough and not pleasant. However, with a little ice, it was drinkable and smoother. I think for the money this is good but overall it is average at best and not as good as Ancient Age or Evan Williams."

2.0,"Nose - vanilla, lemon, butterscotch, powdered sugar, some “green” flavor (a bit like fresh cut grass), ethanol, moderate burn. 

Taste - vanilla, lemon, ethanol, but almost no burn, finishing quick and with the flavor or sweetened ethanol.

Not great, but would probably make a decent mixer."
2.5,Not bad for a cheap whiskey. Keep a bottle around for mixed drinks

2.0,"I am a chef. I make my ""bourbon"" marinades, desserts and bbq sauces with this whiskey due to its lack of smokiness.  It has almost no smoke to it at all.  Smokey notes come through too strong with other similarly low priced whiskey. (Evan,Beam etc)"

4.0,"Early Times has a gold-amber appearance. Aroma is of sweet & light caramel. Also, the drinker will pick up some faint wood. Taste is of mild, charred wood, sweet caramel, alcohol, and a background charred wood. Mouthfeel is medium, and Early Times had a moderate fade. Aside from using used barrels, this is bourbon, essentially (in its presentation). A good value-priced item. RJT"
1.0,"Not sure why they use this in their ""run of the mill"" Mint Julips at Churchill Downs unless they buy it by the tanker load (i.e. VOLUME & CHEAP).  Woodford Reserve is the better choice for the ""high end"" Mint Julip.  However, it will get you to where you are wanting to go, only in a Yugo and not a Cadillac."
