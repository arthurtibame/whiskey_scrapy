4.0,"When I was a kid my grandma always kept some buckets by the door. When we grandkids came to visit, if we filled the buckets, she would bake us an apple pie. The nose of this Glenlivet 18 yr offering reminds me of grandma's pie, with a lovely warm crust, baked apples and brown sugar, all served with homemade vanilla ice cream. The palate is lovely and sweet, with dough, apples and vanilla. The finish is long and satisfying. Tomorrow is the 4th of July and most of my compatriots, if they drink whiskey, will be enjoying a good bourbon or rye, and that's great. As for me, I think I'll enjoy another glass of Glenlivet 18yr, close my eyes and remember the days on my grandparents farm. Happy birthday America, hope it's a good one."

3.0,"Nose: caramel glazed apples you get on a funfair. Actually I get caramel throughout the entire nose. With some salty notes and liquorice. 
I absolutely adore the nose and have to say it's one of the most pleasant ones I had so far but unfortunately the taste falls a little short. It offers some sweet and salty aspects. A little fruity character. the aftertaste ist very pleasant with a long lasting oaky and citrusy lingering. In order to wrap it up it is a fine and pleasant malt. The nose and aftertaste are worth the price tag however, the taste was rather disappointing. 84/100"

4.0,"This is my first 18 year old single malt scotch.  So 4 stars for now as it's significantly better than anything else in my cabinet... Although my oldest whiskeys besides this are Glengoyn 15, and Johnnie Walker Green 15, this is much better than both of those especially the 2017 Green Lable which is not as Good as the one I bought early 2016.   Extremely oaky which is what I like.  Wish there was a bit more peat, but other than that, nothing to complain about.  Not even the price!  $150 Canadian is very reasonable for this."

Nose - Vanilla and oak on the nose, I’m struggling to find the sugary/sweet smell. Love the vanilla though !

Palate - After a few mouthfuls I’ve found the oak very apparent with orange (sweet) coming out.

Finish - A very long finish, even minutes after I’m getting a mouthful of sweety goodness. No burn, not sure what to have expected from an 18 year old, for the price this is very delish."

Glenlivet 18 is one of those drinks that is just fantastic.

4.0,"Nose - Dark apple juice, barrel aged white wine, hint of milk chocolate, sweet brioche, light brie cheese funk.

Taste - Fairly thin but nice creamy/buttery mouthfeel, sweet spicy muscat/apple juice, light cinnamon spice, dark golden raisins, tiny hint of dark chocolate latte foam.

Finish - Lingering dark grape/apple juice sweetness, light cinnamon spice tingle, musty grape, almost cognac-like finish, but fades quickly.

Score - 84/100

Final Thoughts - This one has a very pleasant nose, gives the impression of darker apple/grape juice, but doesn't quite hit the rich leather/tobacco notes that I tend to get with older Scotches. I attribute this to the lower proof & the chill filtration. It's a very approachable dram for sure. Flavors are on point, but they're all very subtle. I think it really falls flat on the finish as it's incredibly short and fades away to almost nothing fairly quickly. A great intro ""higher end Scotch"" I'd say.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - Not at current prices, if I found a bottle for ~$70USD yes"

3.5,"Before getting into a review that may come across as harsh, let’s make one thing clear...this is a good scotch. Fruity, sweet, vanilla, a hint of smoke, slight oak spice. Pretty much checks all the boxes (except peat that I can tell) of what we all typically enjoy in a scotch. Perhaps that’s my gripe, it seems too artificial, too manufactured. An assembly line whisky. The barley probably never saw Scottish soil, no chance of floor malting, likely chill-filtered, looks like coloring added. All that is fine as long as you know what you’re getting - appeal to the masses.

Rating: 90 per Distiller is 5pts too high for me. Enjoyable and I will undoubtedly drink this again but there are 10 year whiskys more complex than this 18 year old. At $86, you might not be disappointed but for me there are others in that range I’d rather see on my shelf."

3.75,"info: un 18 ans d'âge de Glenlivet embouteillé à 43%. Probablement l'une des expressions les plus classique de Glenlivet. Il s'agit de la bouteille la plus vendu après le 12 ans d'âge. Elle a gagné deux mention d'or de l'International Wine and Spirits Competition. On reconnait les embouteillagees de Glenlivet pour ses arômes florales et fraîches. Celui-ci n'en fait pas exception.

Nez: pellures d'oranges, brise salées, caramel.

Bouche: texte onctueuse et bien grasse dans le verre. Définitivement des agrumes et du chocolat amer au fleur de sel. Pomme et noix de Grenoble. Je m'attendais à des notes de sherry, je ne sais pas pourquoi mais, rien de cela. Je crois qu'il y a une petite fumé très éphémère et caché. Les épices sont là... mais, elles n'explosent pas. Sa flotte mais ça ne vole pas. ça s'est formé mais ça n'a pas levé. Boisé sur le chêne brulé et épicé sur un petit gingembre pas très affirmatif. 

Finale: Frais, notes d'orange et d'épice.

Overall: Ok, pour commencer, je vais mettre au clair quelque chose. Je ne crois pas avoir été impressionné par aucune des éditions de cette distillerie jusqu'à présent mais, dans l'ensemble aucune de leurs éditions n'a été complètement un flop non plus (j'exclus par principe le founder's Reserve qui est l'un des pires que j'ai but). La seul édition que je voudrais dans ma collection c'est le Nadurra 16. Ce 18 ans est dans cette vague de produit dont je ne peux dire qu'ils m'ont particulièrement impressionné. Cependant, question aromatique, celui-ci me rejoins déjà plus que les autres éditions plus légère comme le 15 ans ou le 12 ans qui sont vraiment des scotch de soirée. Celui-ci m'apparait plus complexe et plus affirmé (même s'il aurait gagné à s'affirmer davantage). C'est celui qui me semble le plus près de la bonne voie. Si l'on pousserait l'intensité d'un cran, il pourrait être excellent. Je me questionne aussi si c'était nécessaire de le vieillir 18 ans... il semble avoir perdu une petite fumé au file du vieillissement. Pourquoi ne pas faire une version de ce produit en 15-16 ans moins dilué... disons 46%? Je crois qu'il gagnerait des points ainsi. Overall, j'aime bien. Un peu les mêmes points qui m'ont déçu du Glenfarclas 17. Quoique entre les deux je préfères encore le farclas. Un whisky plus pour débutant? Peut-être... cela fait une bonne introduction aux boisiés-épices par son mariage avec le fruité et le florale. On ne peut critiquer un manque de complexité mais, on peut lui reprocher un manque d'intensité et d'affirmation aromatique. Bref, j'aime bien mais ça m'en prend plus pour me charmer. 77%"

This is one of the whiskies that got me excited about scotch. I hadn’t had it in a while so I was wondering if it would hold up. It does; it’s just butterscotch deliciousness!

Nose: warm apple cinnamon cake; slight floral; sweetness, like honey and vanilla; hint of caramel. Overall pretty complex and very inviting.


Taste: The arrival is medium bodied with a pinch of pepper with french vanilla, but as it develops you get light cocoa, brunt toffee, hazelnut, apple crisp, fruits like peach, mango and apricot, and a vanilla icing note, as if from a pastry. 


Finish: medium, gently warming with hints of apple, marzipan , brown sugar and cinnamon sugar closing the show. 


Value: price varies widely in the U.S., from $85-120. Regardless, a worthy purchase.

Final thoughts: In one word: elegant. I love this pour. After leaving the bottle open for about 2 months, this malt really took off, showcasing it's subtle complexity and sipability. This is high on my list of go-to Speyside whiskies and at a price that can't be beat. Buy with confidence. 

Score: 4.5/5 (Highly recommend buying a bottle!

3.5,"I think that Glenlivet, Glenfiddich, and Balvenie are kind of easy-drinking, low-character single malts and I mean that in the best way. They are not super complex. They are very subtle. I find the Glenlivet 18 much more likable than most Glenfiddich. It has a nice nose: very light and fruity. It follows with being a little fruity and malty on the palate but doesn't get super exciting or controversial. It starts sweet and evolves into a light oak spice. The finish goes a little sour and bitter oak to me with a touch of alcohol. Someone on Reddit described it as ""Gourmet Mac and Cheese"" and I think that fits. It's like the gourmet Mac and Cheese of the single malts. It's a nice dram when I just want a drink and don't want anything too challenging for my palate. There are times for a complex whisky and this is good for the other times."

5.0,"Tonight, I'm enjoying something very special to me: a pour of the Glenlivet 18 Year Single Malt. What a wonderful whisky. The Glenlivet 18 was first poured for me by a very good friend and showed me how rich, delicious, and truly decadent a whisky could be without presenting any harsh qualities. Savoring this tonight, I find myself smitten again. I aquired this bottle in a multi-pack at Costco for the equivalent price of about $75 and wish I could afford this quality of whisky on a daily basis. For posterity, I would note that this whisky is colored and chill filtered. My detailed thoughts and rating below: ⠀
⠀
🥃 Glenlivet 18 Year - 43% ABV
⠀
Nose: A delightfully aromatic whisky. Starts with pears, apple, and rich honey. The rich sweetness continues with baked dates, powdered sugar, immense vanilla, and sweet flowers. Very slight oaky astringency, minor baking spices, and some ginger.
⠀
Taste: Heavenly rich pastries with extra butter, baking spices, and a fruity glaze. Caramelized pear drizzled in honey. Rich creamy notes qnd honey continue. This is an incredible dram. As you become accustomed to the sweetness, tea, spices, and oak notes develop. A bit of leather and nuttiness gives the whisky some additional body.

The texture is impresively creamy for the proof and I'd imagine 46% and NCF would be incredible. The finish remains creamy and rich while imparting just a little more peppery spice on your tongue. Goodness this stuff is good. If you've never tried it, do yourself a favor and find a pour! I'll be smelling this empty glass all night. Cheers!

3.75,"The nose is initially rather ethereal and not very incisive, it takes a while to open up, finally presenting itself with hints of green apple, walnuts, a drop of honey. Above all, a turf with wildflowers. Freshly cut wood. Thin and elegant.
The palate is affected by a certain alcoholic puncture, accompanied by a strong presence of malt, with again green apple, honey, raisins, lemon zest. Bitterness of walnuts and dryness of the wood. Definitely more messed up than the smell.
Medium finish, made of wood, green apple, walnuts.
The so-called elegance of Glenlivet here has gone astray! Perhaps the influence of the French oak was deleterious, unbalancing the aromas and bringing the whisky further away from the signature of the distillery.
Too bad, because the smell was not bad at all."

Grilled Apples with sugar, dry fruitiness, mature oak, cornbread and some sherry peels. The mouthfeel is viscous and the finish is smooth and warming. It’s not as good at the 25 year which is easily worth the major price tag but this pretty much wrecks most 18 year whiskies. 97/100"

Arrival on the palate is strong and intense. Very rich and deep. The oak comes through quite intensely. While the palate is really sweet it isn’t very sticky and goes down easily with a peppery burn. There also is almonds and floral notes.

All in all a very enjoyable whisky. Had higher expectations after the 12y but it is a tad better. It is quite strong and intense on the alcoholic burn though. The nose is definitely its strong suit but the palate is also really satisfying. I’m missing a bid complexity and variety. It is straight forward but with just a few different layers."
