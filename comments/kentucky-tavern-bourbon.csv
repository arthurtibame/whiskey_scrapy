2.0,"Bananas on the nose. OMG bananas. The palette is sweet, clean, and quick. If you are going to drown it in mixer have at it. Be careful though, mixing too strong can ruin the drink by letting too much of the spirit come through."

2.0,"Made my wife buy a bottle of cheap bourbon to make bourbon chicken. (She used my Elijah Craig last time!) Kentucky Tavern is what she found. $10 for a big bottle. I figured I might as well try it. 

It's surprisingly sweet on the nose and has hints of orange and vanilla on the palette. Mild spice and little heat for the finish. Honestly not that bad. Not saying I would drink it on the regular, but I wouldn't shy away from serving it at a party or using it as a mixer. And of course, making bourbon chicken too!"
