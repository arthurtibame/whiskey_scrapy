2.75,"Bought in a WV store, VA ABC does not carry it.  $8.99, give it a shot.  750ml neat in Glencairn at home. Nose is grass, corn, grains, mild ethanol.  A little dusty.  Taste is similar, with some caramel and oak notes coming through the middle, then a quick touch of spice on the short finish.  This is nothing great, but then at $9.00 a bottle, I did not expect it to be, and it is certainly worth more than the price.  I can see this as a good mixer base.  8/25/19"

3.5,"Very nice, especially for the QPR"
2.75,"Musty funky aroma and flavor in the beginning after that goes away it's very soft, surprisingly smooth for the price.  Nothing too offensive really, but nothing much really stands out about it either in terms of flavor.  I'd rank this neck and neck with JB white label, but Evan WIlliams (black or bib) are much better quality for not much more money."
