4.25,"Nose: vanilla, sweet, fruity, floral, white oak, almonds

Taste: Strong alcohol start that mellows out to a wheat dominant, sweet honey, butterscotch, orange, light wood barrel flavor with a rye light finish and some smoke. It is very full, warm, smoothe, and syrupy.

Placement: Starts in the back roof of my mouth and finishes on my lips."

3.75,"Cookie sweetness, light vanilla floral on the nose. Oak and tannin spice then corn sweetness and vanilla. Medium light body. Long spicy finish which is odd for a mashbill without rye. High proof is a little hot, but... an interesting wheated bourbon."
4.0,"Light grain aroma
Smooth mellow body, medium
Grain flavor, spice kick after blends with the tail and tingles together with the alcohol
Approachable and well balanced."
3.75,Inhale lightly and your nose will be filled with the scent of peanut butter. The first impression on the tongue is doughy peanut butter cookie followed by pepper and finishing with nutmeg and clove. Not a long finish. Seems just a tad green. It makes me wonder what this would be like after a couple more years in the barrel. All in all not a bad whiskey.
4.0,"Buy buy buy, velvety smooth with some spice"

3.0,"Nose: big on vanilla; Palate: big on oak; Finish: decent medium length. At $123 at the SAQ in Quebec, it’s expensive for a NAS Bourbon"

4.0,I stood in line to get one of the first bottles they ever released and opened it when I found out my wife was pregnant with our first son! What a glorious bottle of bourbon. Has the same wheat characteristics of their whiskey but very smooth and full flavored. Absolutely recommend!
