2.5,"I can best describe this whiskey as “inoffensive”. While I didn’t find anything of note that would allow me to recommend it, there was nothing bad about it either.  Finding it somewhat bland, I added a slice of candied orange peel and enjoyed the rest of the dram."
3.75,"The color is rich golden and clings to the glass with a nose that is subtle, with dark chocolate and baking spices along with hints of ripe fruit, brine, charred oak and green apple. The palate is somewhat rich and fills the mouth with dark chocolate and charred oak, with subtle baking spices balancing it out while the fruity notes linger underneath. The finish is medium with dark chocolate and charred oak that slowly fades, while a hint of fruit gives you a reminder it is still there. The aftersniff has the smokiness of a blown out birthday candle, and the sweetness of grandma pearl’s lingering vaporub after she embraces you in an uncomfortably long hug."

4.0,Like a little more of a fruity Jameson. It’s a good whiskey especially for slow sipping.

3.0,"The spice-filled nose leads way to toasty, charred oak, dried fruit, leather, coffee bean. The finish has good legs and resolves with some praline, raisin and dried cherry undertones. Nice mouth feel from the wheat mash and not heavy or syrupy. Good sip, but doesn't excel in any particular way."
