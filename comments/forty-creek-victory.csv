4.5,"Nose: Rich and sweet with lots of maple and caramel.  I also get some black cherry here.

Palate: Initially sweet with notes of vanilla and butterscotch.  This is followed by notes of prunes, figs, cinnamon, and rye spice.  Lots of flavour here.

Finish: Medium length with nice woody, earthy quality. Some grape/wine notes coming through here.  Tingle on front of tongue fades away to a lingering tingle on the sides of the tongue."
