4.0,"Cask strength, bottled at 54.3%  Initially nothing but a faint sweetness on the nose and burning on the palate and finish. This needs a healthy dose of water to cut down the burn and to open up. 
After adding the water, the nose is very delicate with dried flowers, a hint of cotton candy and a waft of citrus. The palate is viscous and coating, with light citrus notes and cereal grains. The finish is warming and long with sweet grain notes and light spices. 
Despite the subtly of this whiskey, it's got a little sumpin sumpin that leaves me craving more."
