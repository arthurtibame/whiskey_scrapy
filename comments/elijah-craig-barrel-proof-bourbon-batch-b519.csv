5.0,This bourbon is absolutely great especially for the price I had to give it 5 stars. The nose on this is absolutely incredible on the palate toffee is sweetness is dominant but not over powering because is balanced by some oak wood notes. The finish is moderate thou little basic. Is probably more like a 4.25 star bourbon but considering the price I hade to give it 5 star. Is very hard to get this kind of quality dram for 64$.
4.5,Delicious!  The whole package!
4.25,Sweeter than A119
4.5,Dat nose!  And dat burn! I need some water here.  Damn fine whisky.
4.5,Vanilla and oak aroma. Vanilla and oak flavor with caramel notes and a touch of honey in the finish.
4.5,Really candy flavored. Good stuff
4.0,Good stuff here. Get strong alcohol on the nose to be expected for the proof. I get sweet maple syrup and vanilla. On the palate is nice and sweet with a spicy burn on the back end.  Good without water despite the proof. Definite buy.

4.0,Was given a bottle of B519 as a gift. My first taste of ECBP and man am I now a fan! Wish it wasn't so rare to find in Atlanta (on the shelves) or this might become a daily drinker for me.

4.5,Intense. Big flavors. Delicious.
4.0,"750ml poured neat into mini snifter at home.  Loved the A119, let's see how this stacks up.  Nose is full of caramel, some apple peel, vanilla, clove, mild oak.  Nice.  Taste has a burn, with some charred spice, oak, mild toffee, baking spices.  Lingering caramel with a burn, a touch out of balance.  I like it, maybe even a lot, but don't love it like the A119. 7/3/19"

4.0,"Whilst perusing the local haunts to find some rare or well priced Whiskey ECBP is one of those I always pay attention too. Now for the last several months it's been available, but it's only been the C918 batch. To be honest, that was my least favorite Batch in recent memory. It's not terrible, but not one I'd like to re buy. 
So as I am looking thru Liqour Express, again I see a ton of the C918 and just as I am about to give up I see this beauty. To be honest, $69.99 even for a mediocre batch of ECBP is a good buy so I just pull the trigger on it. 
Soooo is it worth the $$$.... let's dive in:
Upon entry it's very soft for this Bourbon but still pretty viscous. Classic Bourbon notes of vanilla, toffee, clove and cocoa. Mid palette features an oak and spice swell 
leading to a long oak, toffee, cinnamon and black pepper finish. It does linger and is definitely pleasing. 
So how does this stack up? Well it's for sure a step down from the A119 batch which was a true stand out. Far better than the sub par C918. It's good for sure but just lacks the ommph an ECBP typically has (I am sure the fact it's a relatively low 122 proof has something to do with that).
All in all it's a nice pour just not one I think you should hunt if you see it on shelves for $70 or less, it's a solid buy. Otherwise hunt the A119 or 2017 vertical. 
Cheers all!"
4.25,"Awesome! Was able to compare with the c barrel. Much smoother, but is lower proof, and more vanilla. No cherry notes like the c barrel is loaded with."

4.25,"Just tasted this next to the A119. 

Beautiful deep amber color. 

Smells of sweet vanilla and cinnamon spice. Maybe a slight hint of baked apple pie. 

With the taste, definitely get heat up front with honey, vanilla and baking spices. 

Finish is long that alternates between sweet and spicy, I would describe it as a blossoming finish. Burn hangs around. Very balanced though. Think both are great but A119 wins."
4.75,"Taste:  2 oz neat in Norlan glass

Nose (5.0) :  Full on caramel bomb with sweet brown sugar, and a touch of vanilla.  Warm, welcoming, and rich

Palate: (5.0)  Caramel, cinnamon, french vanilla and then the barrel spice kicks in.  So well balanced with a warming heat that doesnt overwhelm.

Finish: (4.75) Long finish carries through.  Palate comes through to the finish.  

Overall: I like it better than A119... which was spectacular.  The lower proof makes it more drinkable neat.  Both of these are excellent offering way above their price tags.  Definate bottle buy at retail, I would strethc to this being a $75.00 bottle"

4.25,"Deep amber color. Nose has a distinct note of toasted vanilla marshmallows, with cinnamon spiced apples, cherry cola and oak. Thick oily mouthfeel. Palate brings a blast of cinnamon spice, brown sugar, buttery toffee, and a substantial dose of fruity bubble gum that is unexpected in ECBP (at least to my palate). There is a lot of oak, but significantly less than A119. Finish is medium-long, hot and dry. Lots of oak and cinnamon on the finish, with fresh sweet apples and sweet dark cherries. Overall, more fruit-forward than a typical ECBP profile, but very enjoyable."
4.25,"Strong caramel corn nose
Red fruit palate
Big red finish"
4.75,"My current favorite bourbon. Vanilla, oak, malt, sugar cookie. Not too sweet. Oily and thick. I sip it neat. Finishing my second bottle, have 3 in reserve. I only have more than one backup of two other whiskies, and they're ryes (Angels Envy and Pikesville 110)."
4.25,"Nose: cherry and tobacco 
Pallet: honey sweetness with vanilla and hint of citrus 
Finish: medium to long. High proof but doesn’t drink like it. 
A super nice bourbon and one you should try"
4.25,null
4.25,"Caramel and vanilla on the palate. 
Moderate mouth feel. Slightly oily."
4.5,"61.1% abv
Non-chill filtered

Nose: Sweet, fruit-forward and hot! Notes: butterscotch; toffee; candy corn; straw; yellow and red apple; light brown sugar. Also, is that citrus!?!

Taste: hot at first, with a note of citrus, then develops quickly into dark cocoa and charred oak, with sweet caramel and nuttiness quickly following.

Finish: medium-long. Apple cinnamon crisp, slightly bitter orange rind and oak, and a creamy light caramel corn/vanilla right at the end.

Value: $65-80. Worth the cost.

Final thoughts: Another great barrel proof release from Elijah Craig. While not quite as memorable as batch A119 from earlier in 2019, this is no slouch and won't disappoint any bourbon head. Somehow, despite being 6% less abv than the A119, this one was a bit hotter, but also brings a little more complexity and fruitiness. None the less, a stellar bourbon...glad I picked up two bottles!

Score: 4.5/5. Highly recommend buying a bottle

Malt musing: ""Keep your friends close and your bourbon closer.""

Taste: hot oak, baking spices, caramel, 

Experience: eating hot cherry pie and ice cream on a summer night. Tasty but maybe you took a bite too soon, if you aren't careful while enjoying this treat you could burn yourself. 


I'm not a huge fan of the regular Elijah Craig, but damn this is a treat. A fantastic bourbon. Just be ready for the heat."

Taste is a wash of vanilla, baking spices with bursts of cinnamon. A deep stream of oak and leather are in the back.

Finish is long and warming; another place where the cinnamon shines. The cinnamon is rouned with a touch of vanilla.

This is a wonderfully rich and deep. Would grab it while you can."

4.25,"While I was let down by the hype of the normal Elijah Craig small batch, this barrel proof version completely redeems itself with a little more complexity that keeps me guessing each sip. The nose was rather inviting with Caramel and/or Toffee as the dominate note followed by floral vanilla and baking spices. You wouldn't be able to tell this is a 122 proof bourbon just by the nose. The taste is classic Elijah Craig on steroids and a lot more oily (legs for days and coats the glass and mouth nicely). To me this had less of a rubbing alcohol taste over the small batch version and more intense vanilla and caramel taste followed closely by fruit (citrus is what I'm getting). There is a good amount of spice and barrel bite but it's nicely balanced through the finish which tends to last forever on the back of my tongue with the taste of cherry cough medicine (the good stuff you wanted as a kid). This was enjoyed neat as all bourbon should."
4.0,Carmel toffee candy but not overly sweet if you let it sit in the glass for 30 mins. I definitely add water to unblock the flavors. Taste of banana peel tones down the sweetness. A hint of caramelized orange peel. Vanilla bean. Good value

4.0,"Color - is light copper like a shiny new penny.  
Nose - picked up notes of acetone, leather, cinnamon and peaches on the end.  
Palate - kind of aggressive but not harsh.  Very warm and coating.  Fairly quick.  More leather, honey, charred wood, and cinnamony apple pie. Added a drop of water but didn’t really pick up any new nuance. 
Overall - didn’t blow me away but was nice.  I love the regular EC so figured I’d give this a try.  Price point would probably discourage me from purchasing bottle again."

4.25,Not for the beginner and not for the faint of heart. I recommend trying neat then adding a few drops of water to really pull the flavors out of here. BIG and BOLD should be this bourbons nickname as it will take you back a step when nosing or tasting. Verdict: Very very good stuff but beware the high proof and explosive nose and palate.

4.75,"On the nose is a pleasing array of toffee, leather, orange peel, date, and fig.

Palate: WOW. Liquid cake batter/frosting up front. Cinnamon sugar peanuts and orange zest in the mid-palate. Prickly heat on the backend but it’s a feature not a bug and in no way overwhelms the flavor. The difference between what I got in the aroma and on the palate is very striking although not bad in any way. 

Finish is primarily oak and candied nut, which comes in nicely as the other flavors are fading and is of satisfying length. On the whole a nicely integrated and balanced experience. 

Mouthfeel is viscous. 

Overall fantastic and much better than the last ECBP batch I had. I think the lower proof actually worked to good advantage here, giving the flavor a chance to shine. Considering I got this for just a shade over $50 makes this just a fantastic value."

4.5,"Neat. Neck pour. First time with this batch and the nose is more subtle than any prior batch on memory.  Blind I might mistake this for a Booker’s.  Peanut Butter cookie is the dominate note.  I like this nutty note especially because it is wrapped around these other sweet, sugar cookie notes.  Vanilla and cherry emerge as it opens up.  The oak is starting to come around too.  With that oak, this is reminding me of those peanut butter cookies with the Hersey Kiss on top that my mom makes around the holidays. I love when a bourbon triggers memories just through smell.

Super creamy mouth feel, and not hot either.  This tastes exactly how it smells.  Sugar cookie on the tongue followed by the peanut butter and chocolate.  Cherry and vanilla come through on the tail end of the experience.

I am loving this. Just waves of childhood memories and those peanut butter with Hersey Kiss cookies. It’s so smooth too.  Sometimes these Barrel Proof EC will punch you in the face but this one is almost delicate in ways.  Great pour!"

4.5,"B519 122.2 proof. 

Nose: honey sweet pastry, chocolate vanilla cherry,  yep, dead smack center of my sweet tooth bourbon wheel house. 

Front: oily honey and rye bread spice,  the middle ""bite""  brings out the fresh bakery aspect of the bread notes,  the cherry is a bit subdued by all the other flavor factory spillage as vanilla coke comes in near the middle rear along with some nice fruit notes.  This is probably the 3rd or 5th EC BP I've undertaken and none bring back a recollection of this much of a sugary bonanza as the B519.   

The proof heat finishes with some leftover spice rack and candy reminders.  While very sweet this addition isn't lacking in some nice variation to prevent boredom. As I note my previous tastes include no EC BP that would indicate its been awhile and I gladly say ""hello old friend"" to this standard classic.  A fitting holiday treat. 

Cheers all and happy holler days and merry Xmas!"

4.25,"The color is very deep, intense and rich amber, covering the glass in an infinite amount of heavy legs with the slightest move of the glass. Despite its high proof, it is gentle on the nose and presents a sweet oakiness along with hints of cherry syrup that come out the longer you inhale. Behind it all is a vanilla and toffee creaminess that holds holds the nose together. The palate is dry and chewy with soft but spicy cinnamon warming the mouth, all while there is the toffee creaminess while hints of maple and orange oil make an appearance. The finish is long, chewy and cinnamon spicy with dry oak that lingers as the sweeter notes fade leaving behind the slight string of orange oil. This release goes a bit softer on the drinker compared to its higher proof releases, but the lower proof gives way to being able to more savor what it has to offer. It would be desired to have the sweetness keep more of the spice in check on the finish, but is excellent to sip on all the same."

N(4): vanilla bean and vanilla cream. Floral. Super sweet Cherry. Slight almond nuttiness. Cinnamon

Soft on the nose considering the abv, with a well blended palette of walnuts, maple, brown sugar, citrus and vanilla. A small splash of water brings out subtle notes of melon and an almost sweet oak. Simple; a delicious bourbon no matter how you put it."

You expect a significant burn from the barrel proof, but this is damn near perfect. Heavy brown sugar and vanilla with a hint of nuttiness. Cinnamon burn is strong, but smooth and not over powering. Biggest problem with this one is that my wife loves it more and I may find an empty bottle on the shelf."

Aroma is heavily oaked and paires well with the heavy layers of spices and dark sweets that float through; Palate is rustic heaviness meets delicate baked sweetness; Finish is one of the best bourbon finishes I’ve had, it’s simply perfect.

The nose has milk chocolate, sweet corn, baking spices, freshly baked bread, brown sugar and a hint of cut grass. Very Heaven Hill, and I like that!

The palate is sweet, thick and oily with some sweet corn, baking spices, a hint of cut grass and oak.

The finish is long with lingering sweet corn, confectioners sugar, baking spices with a slight nutty character and a smidge of cut grass with some tingling on the sides of the tongue. 

This might be one of my top Elijah Craig Barrel Proof batches. It reminds me a lot of classic Heaven Hill distillery notes, which I’m a huge fan of. This is a little lower proof than a lot of their batches, but I don’t care. It’s good."
