4.0,"Tasting 3 “water to whisky” tour, drank at peat field, enjoyed it."
4.5,"Ah yes, the annual gift that is Cairdeas.

I am simply loving this year’s expression from Laphroaig. That signature peat smoke grabs your nose as expected, but it’s the finish where this one really shines.

The mouth feel reminds me of the last few Cairdeas releases: thick, velvety, oaky yet very well balanced.

 finish is what separates this year’s release from the previous wine-matured Cairdeas, the 2016 Madeira cask. Where the finish on the ‘16 I felt turned too dry and almost chalky, the fino maturation of this year’s release provides a sweet tanginess: think a fusion of white grapes, caramelized sugar, vanilla bean and fresh pears. A true delight.

Still lots to uncover in this bottle, but I can confidently say Laphroaig did a fantastic job here. I can’t wait for it to be more readily available in the U.S. market so I can grab up a few more bottles.

4.0,"@Richard-ModernDrinking beat me to the first review of this one!  We bought a bottle at Feis Ile 2018, which we then mostly finished on the rest of our road trip around the Highlands, including a particularly memorable experience enjoying a dram of it on a cruise of Loch Ness.  My wife loved this one and described it as the best Laphroaig she's ever had.  This one is an interesting, unique take on Laphroaig, and maybe the sweetest one I've encountered.  I get oatmeal cookies on the nose, and my wife agreed with that but also noted that after a few minutes there is a strong and noticeable scent reminiscent of the barley we sampled on our tour of the distillery.  The palate has some of that sweetness, more in honey realm at times, but subsequent sips get drier and smokier, with some lemongrass and cumin.  The finish is black Chinese tea and spicy smoke.  I agree with @Richard-ModernDrinking that this one bears more than a passing resemblance to 2014's Amontillado."
4.0,"This is bananas, or at least the nose is. That was the dominant note I got from a couple of samples at a tasting event last week. It tastes very much like the 2014 Amontillado bottling, with a thick mouthfeel and flavors of sweet smoke. The finish is creamy and medicinal. Probably the best in the series since 2015."
5.0,"The nose starts with traditional Laphroaig smokiness and the common meaty profile. There is a salty or briny note that definitely changes things. Underlying all of this is a layer of hay and honey and maybe a touch of pear sweetness. The palate is surprisingly oily and mild. There is the honey sweetness, but a whisper of a dark fruit wants to appear. The smoke just sits in the background. The finish has smoke but it is not as strong as the nose, but it does dominate almost morphing into barrel char. The combination of the smoke and meat is more like ribs on a BBQ. The honey sweetness and the smoke blend for a very long, mouthwatering finish."

3.0,"The fino sherry cask finish is gilding the lily on the classic Laphroiag profile, which is ironic because it does add some floral and herbal qualities. Basically my take is that it's subtraction by addition, adding notes that clash with what's good in the original character.

N: Salt spray, ash, pipe smoke, but also a floral sweetness.

P: Mineral, creosote, bitter and sharp notes like you'd find in amaro or gin: anise, rhubarb, peppercorns. Slightly tannic and tart cherries.

F: pretty standard Laphroiag, coating smoke, charred meat, salt.

It's interesting, it just pulls in two wildly different directions and distracts from what I like in the 10 year."

3.75,"Fino cask finish is an interesting pick for something as bold as Laphroaig. Feels like the light sherry influence gets lost among the big, bold taste of what hits the palate as a youthful whisky. After a while the nose opens up, revealing some of the finishing cask. A couple drops of water soothes the harsh finish (likely a young whisky), and makes the dram more interesting. Good whisky, but maybe not worth the price."
4.25,Tasting.  $22 for 3
5.0,"The nose on it is fantastic: barnyard funk, oysters, white grapes, and band-aids, giving way to a palate of one of the most brine-laden Laphroaigs ever released with rich notes of fish oil, white pepper, and cream. Peat smoke and greasy peanuts on the finish, with a lingering vegetable flavor I can't quite place...except it reminds me of the smell of a Chia pet, and all throughout the dram is fruity and RANK.  It's like my beloved funky Belgian gueuzes found a way to rub off on my Laphroaigs. This surpassed the 2013 Laphroaig Cairdeas Portwood Edition as my favorite Laphroaig Cairdeas ever."

5.0,"The nose is utterly intoxicating- it has smoke, coast, and a citrusy flavor derived, most likely from the fino finish.  It has the briney, smokey, coastal flavor that we all know and love from Laphroaig, but it also has a sharp, zesty, citrusy, lemony flavor, from the fino finish.  It's got hot peppercorns, ash, saltwater, and lemon.

Stellar- the only thing better than regular Laphroaig is special, limited release Laphroaig!"

4.5,"info: cette édition annuelle de Laphroaig du Feis Ile nommé Cairdeas, amitié en Gaélique, nous offre cette fois-ci un produit maturé en ex-fut de bourbon de premier remplissage pendant 8 ans à 10 ans et est finis en fut de Sherry Fino (d'où le nom) . Cette expression, très prisé par les amateurs de tourbe, est embouteillé à une intensité de 51,8% soit le taux brute de fût donc non dilué. Couleur naturelle et non filtré à froid évidemment. Pour ceux qui ne savent pas, le fut de Fino est le plus léger des Sherry. Les résidus de sucre ne sont que de 5 gramme par litre. L’'expression Fino provient ""refined"" puisque le fut a contenu un vin de post-traitement (brandy). On s'attend donc à une expression boisé et fruité.

Nez: Tourbe iodé typique de Laphroaig. Steak que l'on fait cuire à haut feu. Un miel et un sel.

Bouche: Tourbe forte de type médicinal typique de la distillerie. Des noix, du miel, de la vanille, du sel du caramel. Quelque chose de très bourbon dans celui-là. C'est chaud et pas gentil du tout. ""Ça arrache la yeule"" comme dirait l'autre. Il y a quelque chose de boisé. Du bois de feu de camp. 

Final: Sèche, boisé, tourbe médicinale, sucré-salé.

Overall: C'est pure. Intense. Frais. Jeune mais expressif. Je ne suis pas contre les NAS en générale tant que l'on peut avoir suffisamment d'info quelque part. Ceci étant dit, j'apprécie son côté boisé et légèrement sucré. Bouche sensible s'abstenir. Belle complexité comme d'habitude. Je n'ose pas le comparer au Cairdeas de 2017, qui m'a semblé plus sucré et plus accessible. Les ""vrais"" fan de Laphroaig seront comblé de ce Cairdeas punchy. Les non-initiés ne seront pas plus initié. Pour ma part, c'est le genre de bouteille qui peut me causé un ""craving"". Quand j'ai le goût d'un coup de point de tourbe, celui du Cairdeas saura combler ce craving. 93%"
4.0,"Golden in color. A sweet, fresh smoky bandaid on the nose. An intense first sip of sweet liquid smoke with a fine nuance of sea salt. Some nice fruit comes through on later sips. The mouthfeel is almost oily with a very pleasant, even burn across the full tongue and throat. Oak comes through when a sip is held and allowed to coat the entire mouth. Some nuttiness appears much later. This is a very nice, complex pour when you’re in the mood for some peat. 4.15."

4.0,"Although my nose managed to sneak past the smoke, my mouth was indeed a casualty. Full of smoke and peat, this assault on my taste buds was welcomed and stayed true to the Laphroaig style. Very enjoyable. Bravo Laphroaig"
5.0,"A sample provided by my good buddy @LeeEvolved.  This year’s Cairdeas is a winner, almost (but not quite) up there with the Port cask one from some years back.  Aroma is typical Laphroaig: medicinal, briny, tarry.  But the difference is on first taste.  Sweet smoke.  Grilled fruits, with pink salt.  Just amazing.  Just like how that port wood Cairdeas is now so hard to find and 5x it’s original asking price, I believe this will be in the same category.  Buy one now, while it’s still barely $100.  Thanks for the pour Lee!"

5.0,"Another top shelf bonus sample to help close out the SDT. This year’s Laphroaig Cairdeas, provided by @LeeEvolved was matured in ex bourbon casks from Makers Mark (where Laphroaig sources all of their bourbon casks) and finished in Fino sherry casks. Bottled at 51.8% ABV and is non chill filtered and natural color of honey gold. 

Classic Laphroaig nose, wafting smoke, medicinal peat, ashy, tarry. Grassier than most other Laphroaigs. Cold ashes, campfire smoke, creosote. Damp earth, moss, vegetal peat and menthol. The Fino notes are buried at first but rise to the surface after some time. Dark red grapes, a touch of vanilla and floral perfume. Towards the bottom of the glass there are toffee and caramel notes. I added some water to see if there was anything hidden under the ABV. Stronger wine notes, mint and florals, but less overall smoke. 

On the palate, heat builds and builds as you hold it on the tongue, then the heat dissipates and is replaced my a mushroom cloud’s worth of smoke upon swallowing. Ashes, bandaids, rubber, iodine and tennis balls. The wine notes are even further buried on the palate, but they’re there, lurking around in the peat bog. Water adds wood spice, mint/eucalyptus. One of those drams that makes you want to stop taking notes and just sit back and get lost. 

A medium to full bodied mouthfeel that is mouth coating and dry. 
The finish is medium short with smoky peat, wine notes and very dry. 

While I still feel that Lore is the best Laphroaig I’ve had so far (it’s just so oily and rich!), this one is in my top 5 from this distillery. On par with the 2014 Amontillado finish Cairdeas, or maybe just below it due to the shorter finish and dry mouthfeel. One clear, CLEAR indicator of its quality... my wife walked in halfway through my tasting and commented that it smelled great in the room. I offered her a taste and she made the face, the face of someone that just had their first South Coast Islay scotchgasm. She’s never done that with any whisky. So kudos to you Laphroaig, you were this husband and wife’s first Islay. Thanks for the sample Lee. 4.5
Cheers"
4.0,Very smoky. More interesting than Laphroaig 10 year. Not as sweet as expected.
5.0,"great peaty taste, fruity and quite sweet. amazing scotch. no way I would have guessed it is over 100 proof."
5.0,"It’s time, once again, for Laphroaig’s annual Cairdeas release.  For 2018 they decided on another type of wine cask finishing- this time it’s Fino cask.  It’s bottled at 51.8% ABV, is classic gold in color and has lots of thick, yet undefined legs and tons of beaded water droplets in the Glencairn.

The nose has the typical, Laphroaig smoke, iodine and sea salt characteristics with a nice, sweet grape must backbone.  The higher ABV indicates youthful spirit but it doesn’t inhibit the fragrance enough to dock the score for it.

The palate is smoked BBQ with tangy and sweet fruits.  It’s pretty oily and a little biting, but mostly mouth watering (which is an exciting change from the 2016-2017 Cairdeas- they both seemed pretty dry by mid-palate and finish).  This is a juicy Laphroaig that immediately reminds me of the Port and Amontillado finished ones.  

Speaking of finish, this one is thick and warming while being syrupy sweet with hints of vanilla.  Again, the mouth coat is astounding and not harsh at all.  

Even though they probably are still using relatively young juice (7-8 years old) this one feels older and I think it’s because there’s a better balance here.  There’s no second guessing the presence of finishing cask notes, as well.  It may be my second favorite Cairdeas I’ve tried.  I think the Amontillado cask was their best and this and the 2013 Port Wood are neck and neck for second place.  These bottles are running around $90 and I’d say they are easily worth the scratch.  Locate one or two and find out for yourself.  4.5-4.75 stars.  Cheers."

But wait, there’s chocolate, bananas foster, and a very subtle dried fruit and sugar. 

This is wonderful. If I had two hours and three ounces I think I write pages on it. Wonderful. Complex. Tasty.

Taste - Complex, explosive, fruity, vanilla, man this has a lot going on.  So i'm getting a bit of a muted vanilla, huge amounts of fruits both orchard and dark and then it just goes to 11 with peat and salt. There's a medicinal classic Laphroaig in the middle of this but otherwise it's all over the map with all kinds of cool tasting notes. 

This I like more than the 10 cask strength, a lot more. The fino barrels are giving this all kinds of awesomeness."

4.0,Not as smoky as other laphroaigs on the nose.  A bit of the sherry like influence on the nose also.  Palate seems thin to me.  Smoke doesn’t overpower this one.  It is present but with richness and sweetness as the main player to me.  Finish is medium with pepper and flora notes.  The more I drink the more chili pepper notes I get on the finish. The first time a tried this bottle I wasn’t a fan because of the sweetness.  While it still isn’t my favorite laphroaig I’ll bump my rating to a 4.0 on this dram.  Wouldn’t buy another bottle but not mad I have this one.

5.0,"The Cairdeas line is quickly becoming one of my favorite lines in all of whiskey. The 2017 Quarter Cask Cask Strength is one of my all-time favorites, and I'm quite liking this 2018 Fino Cask. Let's just jump right in.

Nose: Seaweed, sea salt, and peat smoke jump out of the glass. Campfire smoke. Iodine, band-aid, and ash. Vanilla, honey, and butterscotch sweet notes. Almond and hazelnut. A bit of lemon, apricot, and pear. Soft pretzel. It's primarily briny and salty, but there is also some secondary smokiness and sweetness.

Palate: More sea salt and brine, campfire smoke and iodine. Now with some smoked brisket. Toffee, malt, vanilla, honey, and butterscotch. The Fino cask starts to come through here. Some plum, red grape, golden raisin, and poundcake. There's also lemon and orange citrus, as well as pear, apple, and apricot. Big ashy notes at the tail end of the palate. Like waking up the morning after a campfire in the woods. Superb.

Finish: Salt, cinnamon, black pepper. Nice and spicy as a high-proof Scotch should be. More of the orchard and citrus fruit. Vanilla and caramel sweetness. Long, phenomenal finish.

Awesome stuff. The nose is a bit reserved for a Laphroaig, but is quality nonetheless. The palate and finish are as brash and compelling as any Islay malt I've had. Top mark for this one.

If you force me to choose, I'd give the nod to the 2017 Quarter Cask Cask Strength. But my preference is marginal. The fact is that this is a spectacular whisky. 5 stars. Stay tuned for my review of the 2016 Marsala Cask release. Well done, Laphroaig."

3.75,"First off, I’m a big peat head. Although this is a tasty dram to sip on, I prefer the 2017 Cairdeas over this one for more body to the sip, and it doesn’t necessary hold a candle to the basic Laphroaig 10 which I would take any day over this for nearly half the price.

That being said, it has a very briny nose which is nice, and the sweetness of the scotch overall is not something I would turn away. I would tell you that I get a seaside mist and barbecued meats out of it, but that wouldn’t surprise you from a Laphroaig and it’s all subjective anyway. As far as Laphroaigs are concerned, buy yourself two 10s or a Lore instead. Much more worth your $."

4.25,"Since i really really loved the Laphroaig Cairdeas 2017 cask strength, i bought that one and it came with this 2018 cairdeas Fino cask expression, which is a very good dram, but inferior to the 2017 one. 

Fino is a type of sherry but a white wine sherry (¿?) Which tends to be more tropical just as white wine. 

Bottled at 51.8% amber color.

On the nose: Bonfire, Lemon, Burnt hay, Grapefruit, Citric and peat. Pure peat. Gun powder; Toffee very dim; Sea food. Shells. Oysters.

On the palate, Grapefruit, Ashes, Mint and Oysters. It has an Earthy - beachy profile.

Aftertaste is medium long, with a mixture of spices: Smoke, Sulphur, Salt, Pepper and Wasabi. 

Overall this is a very enjoyable dram, you dont feel the 51.8%abv anywhere, but it seems like it lacks ""that certain something"" to step up and become not just a good whisky, but a great one. 89/100."
