2.0,More brine than anything. Not a fan especially at the price point. Underwhelmed.

5.0,"On the nose one of the best smelling bourbons. Very inviting.
Palate is simple and you can tell right away the wheat shines through.
Finish is medium with just a hint of spice to remind you this is bourbon! Very solid sipper."

4.5,Delicious.  Similar to Blantons.
2.5,Smells like a familiar wheated bourbon. Some grass notes as well. The intensity on the palate is surprising. A bouquet of floral and wood notes. But the classic vanilla and caramel bourbon notes are missing. Lingering note is herbal and mildly bitter. Pleasantly sweet throughout. Smooth mouthfeel. 6/29/18

1.0,I wanted this to be sweet and salty like a sea-salted caramel. Instead it drinks like you just got a forced dose of sea water down your throat and you’re trying to hold back the vomit. Yep. It’s that bad.

4.0,"Very fruity and salty on the nose. Because of the wheated mash bill, the taste is somewhat spicy/peppery, but smoother than a traditional wheated bourbon and certainly more briny, with some nice subtler notes of banana and tropical fruits. Not the longest finish but not super short either."

3.5,Nose produces a bit to much ethanol.  Oak and a bit of caramel.  Decent legs as it runs around the glass.  A bit harsh on the palate.  Hot with black pepper.  Finish is short with a bit of a sour wood taste.  Overall it’s rough around the edges and I wouldn’t pick up a bottle of this.

4.0,An appreciated drink.  Agree with the overview of the expert review though I don’t battle the brine overall.  For me it’s a nice accent but still with a bit of spiciness sand wood that lingers.  I rather enjoy the drink.
3.5,Hot but very wheaty
3.75,"Fruity and toasty nose; mild, salty and sweet but an overall balanced bourbon. Much more mild than expected, but a nice change of bourbon pace. Pricey for what it brings to the table."
