4.0,"Dalmore (if the internet is to be believed!).  Distilled on May 31, 2007.
Warming and extremely spicy.  I don’t get the doughiness the society mention, but this cask strength is a complex whisky.  There are some floral notes in there, but layered behind spice and apple sweetness.  Very moreish!  I finished my first dram whilst writing this, so I may have to go back for a second."
