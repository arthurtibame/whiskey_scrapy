3.75,"Sometimes vanilla is boring and sometimes that's just what you want whether it be ice cream or whiskey. In this case, vanilla and honey specifically. Straight up nothing fancy. Not to much of the usual bitterness which plagues these cheaper offerings. $50USD and solid 3.5 to 3.75, rounding to 4 on VFM just because that's what plain vanilla deserves when you are in the mood for it."
