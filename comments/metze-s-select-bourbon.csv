4.0,"More rye spice in nose and up front, distinct pepper too. Then mellows with longer sweet caramel and vanilla notes, medium-length finish."
4.0,Good bourbon. Adding a little water will cut the heat of the 93 proof. The taste is definitely spice but it ends with a sweet mellow aftertaste.
4.0,Sweet and smooth

4.0,"Was excited to hear that MPG was offering a bottling of their own juice.  And that it was named after their master distiller was encouraging.  While I admit to enjoying higher proof/barrel proof offerings.  I find this first to market offering lacking in flavor and sipping like watered downed whiskey.
    
    It's certainly not worthy of its price tags.  I'll not purchase it again."

5.0,"Sweet notes of cherry blossom, vanilla and cream soda on the nose. For a 93 proof, the palate isn't as hot as you'd think and brings rye notes of black pepper, caramel, coconut and spice. The finish lingers and really showcases the sweeter baking spice notes."
