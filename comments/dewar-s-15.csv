3.0,"Nose- Honey, lemon, and a hint of wood
Body- the honey and lemon continue into the taste of grass and earth
Finish- the lemon takes over in the finish which is fairly long with a peppery spice
Notes- I’m not really end to blends and do not care for Dewars White Label. This was a thoughtfully random gift from a coworker and I will never look a gift horse in the mouth. I’m glad that I didn’t. This scotch isn’t bad. It starts off a bit too sweet for me and is a little stringent for my taste. However, it has depth and is an easy drinker."

5.0,"Similarly smooth as Dewar’s 12 The Ancestor, however it has a richer body and more stable taste profile throughout. I agree with the expert, if you like The Ancestor, you may like this a bit more."

3.0,"Nose: Malt, light butterscotch, a little lemon custard, creme caramel, and some green apple. When you nose it deeply the grain component is revealed. There's also a light vanilla biscuit note like savoiardi and the evidence of some sherry casks. The dry glass has a hint of smoke.
    
    Palate: A very pleasant and easy arrival - smooth and creamy sweet malt and a hint of fruitiness. The development is slow and measured, more fruity notes emerge with some nuttiness and the lightest trace of ginger spice, but it's mild ginger simmered in ghee. The texture is light and airy, but I wouldn't criticise it as watery or thin - just delicate.
    
    Finish: Short. This one disappears pretty quickly with a touch of spice in the tail.
    
    It's not at all bad, but it's the epitome of a smooth and easily-quaffable blend so don't expect anything bold in the profile. It's actually a very old-fashioned style of blended whisky that would have been popular 50 years ago.
    
    The main criticism is that it's in a price band where it's competing against more interesting blends and some very good lower priced malts (Compass Box Spice Tree is only $10 more) and you'd have to really love smoothness over all else to be able to justify it.  Personally I don't think it offers a great deal over the much cheaper Dewar's 12 year old - I don't dislike it by any means, but I won't be buying another bottle.
    
    ""Above Average"" : 3 stars"
4.0,"sweet nose like slightly melted butter.  pretty, smooth, nice long finish that you can linger and think about.  Smokey elements Left on the tongue.  no burn, no complications, gold tin seems appropriate, Dewar's did alright on this one.  not sure if I'd recommend this or scratched cask as Dewar's finest achievement.  there's a little left in my bottle for an A/B comparison, I will let you folks know when I can finally compare the two.  I guess that will determine which gets 5 stars and which gets 4.  I would assume the scratched cask so I'll leave this as a 4 for now...."

4.0,"This is a smooth, easy-drinking blend.  I actually tried this before trying Aberfeldy as a single malt, and I see how Aberfeldy is at the heart of these Dewar's blends.  It has a well rounded character with some oakiness, but overall its predominant features are a nice malty sweetness that verges on fruitiness at times.  I'm not sure if this remains widely available, I got it when my store was clearing it out at under $30 a bottle, and at that price it was an excellent value."
3.0,"Nose: smooth, sweet, honey and butterscotch on the foreground, shades of heather.
    Palate: well-expressed flavour of butterscotch, followed by gentle oaky theme. Good balance, one can feel a decent age of this whisky.
    Aftertaste: mid-to-long, warming, sweet, spicy.
    Overall: very good for a proper price, $40 for 0.75l would be an upper adequate price level  (at least in Russia, early 2017).
    This whisky is good for thoughtful tasting, and it's great for drinking with your friends.
    3,3/5 stars (78 score)."

Taste - Quite balanced. Sweet and smooth, notes of cereal and honeyed pears."

3.75,"Dewar's is one of the oldest and most recognizable names in the blended scotch game. So when I saw this bottle with a 15 year age statement for only $40 I had to try it. This whisky is made in much the same style as its younger brother, the 12 year. It is very smooth and easy to drink. 

The nose is full of vanilla, with some butterscotch, honey and a slight amount of pear. The palate is mild and very sweet, lots of floral flavors with some beeswax before yielding to grain whisky flavors. The grain whisky continue to linger and is joined by some more sweet undertones during the long smooth finish.

This may be the most polite scotch I've ever tried. It really goes out of its way to not be offensive. That politeness does come at the cost of any complex or strong flavors. I would like to give this a higher rating, you can tell there are some great malts somewhere in this whisky, but it is just too mild for my taste. But if you enjoy grain whiskies I can recommend this as a good value."

3.75,"For a super straightforward and one dimensional whisky, this is not a bad dram at all, it is just simple. Actually it is very enjoyable and it is very very easy on the palate. Not very interesting in terms of tasting and aroma notes.

Bottled at 40%abv

On the nose, Honey, Red apples, Orange, Grass.

On the palate, it is the most easy drinkable whisky ever. Not in a fantastic way though. It only tastes like honey cereal and red apples. 

Aftertaste is.... well more honey. And Vanilla.

Overall this dram is what it is supposed to be: a cheap 15yo that delivers enough fun and flavor for the not-so-experts in whisky. My score is 72 over 100, but surely feels like it should at least be 78."

3.25,Simple sweet relatively smooth good enough
3.0,"Wife grabbed me this for Valentine's and so here we are. I personally avoid sweeter ""drink this after dinner if you want a dessert"" profiles usually but dont tell her--it was a 100/100 if she asks.

Nose is immediately inviting with honeysuckle, dry beach grass, and a faint bergamot. 'Good medicinality' sounds oxymoronic but it's just behind the sweets.

Palate starts off a little one-dimensional taking you somewhere between marzipan and burnt creme-brulee. The palatability starts kinda meh (for the age, but maybe not the price) however after a couple small sips the little things become easier to taste. Delicious tannic vannila. Richness of bananas foster. The vaguest tease of antique oak furniture freshly polished. Hint of raw almonds.

Mouth is velvety. Soft, soft, soft. It's a good thing here. A little pop of oak closes the whole show right after gentle dry sweetness gets you there.

I wanted to like it more, but it just wasnt all that special. Holding out more hope for the 18y and older by Dewars as I hear much better things about them."

2.75,Color is rather pale. Flavor seems a bit weak. There is an antiseptic after feel and a tiny bit of an antiseptic aftertaste. It has a flowery nose. The nose has a better flavor than the taste.
