1.0,This tastes like crap and is what daring college kids here in Japan chug to get smashed.... (they call it the Black Nikka Challenge 😅) it's about $7 for a 700ml bottle here in Japan and can be found in just about every store. I'd recommend saving your money and skipping this completely unless you want to try the Black Nikka Challenge....
