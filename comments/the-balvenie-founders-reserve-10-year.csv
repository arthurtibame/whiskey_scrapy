4.5,"While the version pictured here is now rare, there are even scarcer iterations that preceded it. My sample was from a 1980s era release that came in a 1 liter Cognac-style bottle seen here: https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/52403/balvenie-founders-reserve. Perhaps whisky needed to pretend it was Cognac back then to command attention. It really shouldn’t have required any help given how excellent its contents are. The nose is more expressive than I typically find on a Balvenie, with honey and floral notes. Milky toffee flavors dominate the palate with an intensity that belies the 43% ABV and linger into the very long finish. There’s a touch of a bone dry white wine to the aftertaste as well. Quite delicious and very different from a modern Balvenie. I wish I had more."

3.75,"Strong aroma of honey like mead, sherry, a bit of smoke. Clove. Hint of butterscotch aroma, green apples? maybe some orange or marmalade hints in the nose."
2.75,Too sweet. Still good

4.75,Incredibly powerful chocolate and raisin aroma.  Flavor is unbelievable and the finish just goes on and on with baking chocolate and dried dark fruit.  This whiskey seems to be better after a few months opened in the bottle.
