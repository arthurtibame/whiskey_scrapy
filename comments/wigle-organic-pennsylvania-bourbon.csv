4.0,If you love the way a campfire smells (and your clothes after sitting next to a camp fire) then you'll love this whisky. It's perfect for those who want something a bit lighter and smokier for summer without peat.

4.0,"Waaaaay better than I expected.  For only being aged 21 months, this has some serious Bourbon flavor.  It has a nice caramel and vanilla flavor but still has that spicy hit on the palate.  Damn good."

4.0,"Don’t let the “organic” label scare you. This is surprisingly complex and full or flavor. Nose is sweet and smoky. First taste was vanilla, second was oak, third was brown sugar. Opened it up with a small ice cube which really brought out the smoky flavor. One of my new recommendations at the bar. Great for sipping neat or in a manhattan."

Ten minutes later. 4/29/18.
Really! This is exceptional!"
4.0,"It was great to see a distillery within the City of Pittsburgh. I have Batch 1 from both the small cask and barrel strength series.  The use of local grains gives this bourbon a unique taste that is not harsh for its 90+ and 100+ Proof releases. I like it better with a rock than a splash or neat.  However, anyway will not do you wrong.  At first, I thought it was a tad pricey.  However, after seeing other bourbons out there with higher price points and in my opinion, less quality I have reconsidered my view.  I share this with my friends who hail from Western Pennsylvania as I do with the Monongahela Rye."

3.25,"The nose sweet and there are notes of acetone and ethanol. Clearly a young whiskey, but not harsh. After a rest, notes of fresh corn, slight vanilla, and fresh oak make their way forward. The low proof is given away on the first sip. Tasty, but simple. Light, a bit one-note."
