3.0,A solid oddity and something to keep on as a staple to distinguish from the Chivas and Johnny crowd if need be.

4.75,Color very very pale. But in my glass it is actually much darker. Maybe the angles of the bottle change the lighting like a diamond. Bottle is so unique. I know that shouldn’t really matter in a tasting but I love it. There is a Carmel flavor on the nose and It is very Carmel tasting. Very smooth. No After burn. Vanilla flavor. Might be my favorite tasting so far.
3.0,First encountered in the Philippines in 1967. Armstrong's staple there.
4.0,Very smooth. Light smoky leather like a scotch but nice vanilla warmth like a bourbon.
