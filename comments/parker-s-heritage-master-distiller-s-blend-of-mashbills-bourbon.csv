4.0,Smooth to start but very spicy finish.  Added a few drops and it helped a little but still kicking.

5.0,My all time favorite bourbon. So many flavors and very easy on the palette in spite of the higher proof.
4.0,"137.9 proof. Oak and coconut on the nose, some sting as well. A bit acidic on the palate, definite rye spice, although the finish is somewhat short. Some sweetness, dark chocolate. The fruit component lingers a bit. Definitely drink smoother than the proof would suggest. 8/23/17"
