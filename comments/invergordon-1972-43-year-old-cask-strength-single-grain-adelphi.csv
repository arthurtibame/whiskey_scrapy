4.25,"Quick Fact: This distillery was opened in 1959 to provide employment after the Royal Navy left. One of 140 bottles I was lucky to get my mitts on a dram. Well not surprisingly Adelphi does it again. Takes a beautiful 43 year old spirit and treats it right. Rum, sherry richness. Beautiful dram. Interestingly the retailers notes say Ex-Bourban cask but there must be a solid finishing in Ex-Sherry. Was around the $400 USD when available but now all gone it seems. 4.25"
