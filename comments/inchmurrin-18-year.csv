4.0,"nose is a little fruit and Vanilla and a lot of wood from the cask. palate is creamy and sweet, like a sucking lolly, very rich with a bit of fruit and spice on the finish"
4.0,"Great whisky, with aromas of gentle peat, brine and delicate sweetness (more Bruichladdich than Lagavulin). There's cantaloupe on the palate with bitter cacao nibs towards the end, maybe some black tea too. Full-bodied and oily with a prolonged finish."

4.0,"The cure for whatever it is that strikes me as funky with Loch Lomond's output is, evidently, time. This 18 year sees the funkiness turn to a delicious malty note on the nose, with some restrained vanilla and caramel, as well as nutty notes. On the palate, it's quite lovely - toffee and butterscotch are forward and obvious, but neither is too sweet, and are complemented by the almond and spice notes. It has a nice, long, beautiful linger on the palate. Really quite nice, if pricey."

3.5,"A rather unknown Island whisky, not only i haven't heard of it before last night, it is so unknown that not even my 3 whisky apps have any reviews of it. 

Bottled at 46% it has a very reddish color.

On the nose, the alcohol note is way to strong not letting any other notes to appear. My nose has trained itself not to perceive the alcohol notes in a whisky but this one was very powerful not letting me smell anything else than alcohol. I decided inmediately to add a couple drops of water to it and let it sit for some minutes. a very very very stinky peat appeared, with hints of chocolate and nuts, like a snickers.

On the palate is most interesting, i got caramel, a gentle spicyness, Marzapan, toasted bread and cardbox. the finish is medium with also a medium body, filled with peat in an elegant way.

Overall it is a different experience, the nose is the worst part, losing points there. The palate is very interesting with non traditional notes."

3.5,Spicy with a small amount of smoke.  There is a strong presence of oak.  A hearty brew.

3.75,"It’s the second time when the Loch Lomond distillery was close to impress me since not only this 18 years old Inchmurrin satisfied my curiosity but also brought a joy.
The aroma is thick and rich, full of sour berries like arrowwood berries or cowberries with some dusty and stale notes. It also has much sweetness and spiciness in it, something like a sweet chili bubblegum, with just a hint of maple syrup, vanilla, cardamom, a handful of raisins, a bit of cinnamon and milk chocolate.
The taste resembles of sherried whiskies though the label doesn’t say much about the cask. There’s a rich distinct taste of milk chocolate infused with raisins and spices, dates, almond, apricots, licorice, barberry and Diet Coke.
The aftertaste is fiery spiced, even peppery with notes of honey and cinnamon.
It might seem to be rough at some point but it’s just a bad first impression.
Inchmurrin 18, unlike the 12yo or the Original, shows a greater potential in balance and possesses its own taste profile what consequently leads to a higher appreciation point although it hasn’t got rid of those unpleasant damp, dusty notes.
In overall this whisky is far from being called a masterpiece, but it’s a lovely, fairly complex, well-set whisky with a value consistent to its price."
