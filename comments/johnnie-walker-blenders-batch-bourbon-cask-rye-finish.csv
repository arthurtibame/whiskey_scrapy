4.0,"One of the ""limited"" new expressions from Johnnie Walker, Blender's Batch Bourbon and Rye finish. Expect grain on this one. Its about $75, lets see if it holds to that price.

Bottled at 40%abv probably colored.

On the nose, very interesting: Ice cream vanilla, Banana influence of bourbon.
At the same time i can feel the rye grain
Sweet but a rye touch. Very interesting
Spicyness very dim and pleasant, a cinnamon spicyness. Maybe some caramel too. Wet the walls of the glencairn to reveal wet rice and maybe soap, similar to bruichladdich. 

On the palate rye influence is enormous. A dry, spicy but mild dram, very grassy, hay-like and oily. Clove finish, with a little burning sensation, grain influence very present in this one.

Adding a drop of water revealed ""dulce de leche"" ice cream. Much too watery on the palate and a grainy finish as if it were a haig club, grassy.

Overall i give this dram a fair 81 over 100. I would not buy it again but it is not a bad dram."
