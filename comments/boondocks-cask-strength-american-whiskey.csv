4.25,"Sweet smell to start. I catch vanilla bean and caramel. Very smooth and light on the burn. I taste exactly what I smelled however, I also noted a bit of my favorite pipe tobacco. Nice small burn to finish out this whiskey."

3.0,"Super sweet on the nose. Candy-like. Super smooth on the tongue, for 127 proof it doesn’t act like it at all. Taste is interesting and you can notice the lack of oak (this is aged in used barrels). Goes down easy with a touch of alcohol to remind you it’s power."
4.0,"Look - dark gold like caramel popcorn 

Smell - a fruity smell that goes sweet to a caramel with a lil burn smell at the end

Taste - that smoke that is sweetened to a dark carmelized salty tingle. I think it's the high alcohol %

Finish - Doesn't have much but a honey sweet end that is quick.

Overall - A good 1 to sip and enjoy not much of a kick for the high alcohol but does well in the flavors

Cheers Live Life Happy"
4.25,Not as harsh as you might expect from 127 proof. Great nose.
2.5,"Nice nose, sweet. Soft earth palate. Bad, harsh finish."
