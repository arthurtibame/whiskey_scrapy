3.0,"Score closer to 3.5 than 3; it's a worthwhile step up from the entry-level barrel select, and a pretty solid Canadian whisky for the (sub-$30) price. But it is still Canadian in style, and carries with it Canadian whisky's tendency toward being overly sweet--though it's offset at least a bit by a really nice bit of rye and some cinnamon hearts flavour. Smells and tastes of toffee, butterscotch, cinnamon hearts candy, ginger, nutmeg, clove, maple syrup, candied pecans, dried fruits, bitter orange. Vanilla. Slight corn. Spicy rye. Absurdly drinkable. The extra ABV over the standard Canadian 40% really helps out a lot--this is a good, reliable, stalwart Canadian whisky at a great price."

2.75,"Hit or miss for me. Either delightful candied walnut but mostly harsh ethanol on the nose. A bit more consistent on the palate, very rich and smooth with notes of toffee. Finish becomes almost a mix of the richness toffee with ethanol to me. Decent for the price."
2.75,Carmel chocolate on the nose and to taste. Feel the burn all the way down. Good for what it is.

4.0,"Once again Forty Creek comes through with an outstanding value whisky. Having had fallen head-over-heels in love with their BARREL SELECT whisky, my expectations might have been too lofty to give the COPPER POT RESERVE a fair critique without a follow-up blind tasting.

With this caveat out of the way, this whisky is certainly going to be a palate pleaser for both you and your guests that might early in their whisky journey.

Chocolate, vanilla, and cherry notes creates an inviting and accessible product that goes well with aromatic cigars, rich desserts, and just enjoying it neat."

2.0,"Initial smell is rubbing alcohol. Taste is the same with some caramel. I had to add ice cubes to this one. The rubbing alcohol retreats and a bourbon comes out. More caramel, marshmallow, and other bourbon qualities."

3.25,"Indeed this does add on to the already excellent(4star) Forty Creek Barrel Select and take it all the way. The extra aging and bolder spice and vareity give this one all you can really ask for at this price point, just an outstanding quality in a Canadian whiskey.  
  
  Forty Creek has finally made a Canadian whiskey that actually has enough appeal to satisfy a rich American bourbon drinkers desires.
  
  Take this one home!"

3.0,"This is the standard whisky I stock at our local community theatre bar! One of the best value for quality Canadian whiskies. $29.95 for a 750,000 bottle at the LOBO."

3.0,"The nose is sweet corn, butter, caramel, a bit of wood and chocolate covered nuts.  If the palate carried the nose, this would be stunning, but it simply doesn't make it there.  It's fairly one-note, and that note is all sweet corn. A small hint of butter caramel shows, balanced by a bit of spice,  but overall it's a letdown after the opening act of the nose.  The best thing that can be said for this is that it is incredibly easy to drink, and not particularly offensive in any way.  And for less than $30, if you find that you really dislike it, it's not a huge hit to the wallet."

4.0,"Superb whisky. Much better than the regular standard canadian whiskies like crown royal etc. You can really taste the rye, barely, and corn distinctively. It's really rich and ""dark"" tasting. One complaint is that it does have a slight alchohol bite but for the price $25 you can't really complain."
2.0,Simply not as good as regular Forty Creek.  Not as smooth

5.0,"Forty Creek Copper Pot has a copper appearance. The aroma is very sweet and candy like. I picked up cream, caramel, and butterscotch. There is a mild alcohol burn. Taste is nutty, woody, with a light char. There is more caramel, in the flavor, but not so much butterscotch. There is a moderately long finish. RJT"

4.0,"Copper Pot is my favorite product out of the Forty Creek line up. If law would permit me to have a drip bag of this nectar of the gods I would surely by slapping the wrist every day for a hit.

Copper pot has an abv of 43% and scents of toffee, caramel, and brown baking spices. I began drinking this almost 10 years ago mixed with pepsi or coke. A great cocktail for any occasion and a wonderful way to introduce someone into the world of whisky. I believe that starting out with their intro product - barrel select - as it showcases their staple in the industry. Not only that, but it has a wonderful taste of vanilla, ginger and toasted oak. A go to for those seeking the experience at a low cost of $40 approximately. Back to Copper Pot though. 

This is a product I would say is a 4 out of 5 based on how enjoyable it is although it's not a barrel strength whisky. It's pure fun and is one on the palate that always brings me back to the first time I've had it. A distiller score by the experts of 89...hard to say if that holds true. Is it enjoyable? Yes. Is it something you can compare to a single barrel / cask strength? No! Would I recommend to pick up a bottle ov er the premo bottles in their collection? Yes definitely. 

Folks, go get yourselves a bottle of this. It's inexpensive, a good bang for it's buck and has wonderful notes to continue revisiting it years after past."

3.0,"This whisky has a light nose that was tough for me to pick up. Sweet, a bit of fruit or floral notes, a hint of spice. On the palate it was immediately sweet and almost sugary. Butterscotch or toffee. Then the rye came through and picked up on the edges of my mouth. The finish brought out more wood or oak notes, but no char and it dissipated quickly. For the price, a very good and enjoyable Canadian whisky (3.5 stars)"
3.0,"Rich sweet toffee, soft baking spices and gentle oak. More refined than Barrel Select but still over sweet for my taste. $32 in Ontario."

3.75,"One of the best whiskeys no let’s say Spirits for under $30 cad! You have something better let me know :) Some rate good whiskey by smoothness and blandness if that’s you this probably would rate this low but 1 give me a break hate seeing 1’s on distiller hope they erase outliers...anyways this is thick mouth coating and tastes rich and decadent with flavours of chocolate, spice, vanilla and corn, there is a little musty note but really delicious and yes it burns a little but it is 43% so add a little water and it gets sweeter and smoother excellent whiskey not much  I would buy until $70  and that would be wisers 18 or Canadian Rockies 21 maybe bear face at $39 :)"

3.0,"Nice butterscotch and chocolate notes, but very slight.  Shows promise, but too little flavor and too much alcohol on the palate"
3.0,"Nose: Burnt marshmallow, vanilla, creme brulee crust.

Taste: Sweet syrup, wood char, pecan pie. 

Experience: Fall. wet leaves, and sweet syrups. All it needs is the warm sweaters to go with it. 

3 stars only because I like other options more. it's still a fine option for the price."

4.0,"Maybe it's just that it's Girl Scout cookie season around here, but my initial thought was that this is exactly what a Samoa (or Caramel Delight...apparently there are regional variants for the names) would taste like if it were a whisky. Given that Samoas are my favorite Girl Scout cookie, I would call that a positive association. As soon as I poured myself a dram, I could pick up a rich, fudgy chocolate note. It's joined by caramel, vanilla, and coconut, and maybe even a little cherry cola. We're already talking my language here at the end of a long, stressful day. The palate doesn't disappoint, either; rich and full, it's full of chocolate, caramel, a slightly salty nut (pecan, maybe) accent, and bit of black pepper. The finish is reasonably long, with a slightly dry nuttiness to round things out. It's not the most challenging or complex dram of all time, but it is as pleasant as they come. This is a hell of a find for less than $30 a bottle, and it is certainly not the kind of anemic, characterless mixed drink fodder that's typical of mass market Canadian whisky. Definitely going on my list of go-to house whiskies!"

3.75,"The nose is gentle with dark chocolate, vanilla custard, dark cherry, apple and the most subtle baking spices. The dark chocolate carries through to the palate with a sweet nuttiness, while chewy caramel shows up as the whiskey breathes and strong baking spices balance out the sweetness. The finish is medium to long, with a fading maple pecan caramel candy that leaves soft black pepper to linger."
4.0,"Thanks to the nifty app we all use here, I was able to do some research and learn more about Canadien whisky. Canada gets a bad rap, though the options available to us in the USA are somewhat limited and the rumor is that they keep all the good stuff for themselves. Maybe they’re smart to do so, but I’m glad they shared this one with us. 

Drinking this reminds me of being in a dusty wood shop while roasting s’mores. The unique blend has a malty, biscuity mouthfeel with some subtle notes of chocolate, and a nice long finish that’s perfect for curling up in an armchair with a large book. 

At under $30, and with a little water to open it up, this is one tasty deal!"
