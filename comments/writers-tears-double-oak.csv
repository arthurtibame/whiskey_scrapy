2.0,"I really want to like this. I love single malt (scotch and irish version) and I love pot still Irish Whiskey. It sounds so promising. Take these two GREAT things and combine and age them together. When you first nose it, it smells nice. Fruity and maybe a little malty. It is fairly nice on the palate until the finish in which a strong bitter, maybe astringent quality takes over. I have tried it a few times and get it each time. I don't know if it is from the cask wood or maybe I got a bad bottle or what. Anyway, I added water and the finish got less bitter and a little more fruity and sweet but still there was some bitter there. Once the bottle is gone, I will not get another. I also have the cask strength but have not tried and I hope it is better. I do tend to get a little bit of bitterness at the end of Irish Pot Still in general but not like this. I recommend trying a sample or a dram at a bar if possible before buying a bottle."

3.75,"A bit sharp but a nice irish whiskey.
Nice biscuit note's and the red fruit from the cognac comes through."

4.25,"Nose - Apple, cinnamon, dried fruit, milk chocolate.
Taste - Oak, caramelized sugar, cinnamon, some pepper, and chocolate.
Finish - Long. Very satisfying. Not overly sweet.

This is a very satisfying twist on traditional Irish pot still whiskey. Double Oak is a higher ABV than Copper Pot, at 46%. Finishing the whiskey in French oak has added a subtle hint of oak spice complexity and cognac sweetness."
3.25,"The nose is heavy with honey. At a higher proof than the Copper Pot, the ethanol hits up front but gives way to pleasant honey and vanilla. Not as sweet as the regular counterpart, this drinks more like bourbon. Fuller bodied, but more fruity than bourbon could hope to be. The spices and ethanol linger longer than expected, probably due to the fuller body. I would let it breath a little prior to enjoying. Would reserve this for special friends and business meetings. This would make a great gift, but I don't think I'll spend the extra again over their regular offering"

4.5,"N: Lemon and baked goods. Slightly woodsy. Some toffee and, of course, caramel.

P: Vanilla and citrus. Sweet tropical fruit, like mango maybe, but a little softer. Cinnamon spicy finish, but super smooth. Little bits of slightly burnt baked apple pie around the edges of the mouth. 

Very tasty. Really delightful. Worth keeping on hand."
4.25,"Nose - Shortbread cookies, berries, cinnamon and other baking spices, a hint of oak/vanilla, and cooking fruits (apples/pears).
Palate - Full-bodied and incredibly rich. Cereal and graham crackers, dark berries, milk chocolate, toffee, cinnamon spice, and pepper.
Finish - Long-lasting. Coats your tongue and is not overly harsh. Excellent combination of complex flavors.

I enjoyed Irish Tears' Copper Pot, but I felt that with a name like ""Writers' Tears"", there should be drama. It should be something complex enough to warrant the name. I found Copper Pot's smell underwhelming. The flavors were good but almost overly-sweet and vanished quickly. 

Looking at Double Oak side by side with Copper Pot, Double Oak is much darker in color and looks more like Green Spot. Double Oak also comes in a higher ABV at 46% (non-chill filtered) instead of Copper Pot's 40%. Some of my favorite whiskies are experimental whiskies finished in different barrels, so between the finishing and higher proof I was very earger to try this one out.

The good news is that Writers' Tears Double Oak delivers on all 3 criteria with more of everything. It has an intriguing aroma. Where Copper Pot smelled like green apples and malt, Double Oak is reminiscent of freshly baked apple pie with all of the notes of sugar, browned pie crust, baked apples, and cinnamon. On the palate, Double Oak is packed with interesting flavors that sit in harmony without being overly sweet. The flavors also coat your mouth and stay with you for much longer on the finish.

I was not expecting enough changes to justify the price gap between Copper Pot and Double Oak, but I was pleasantly surprised. Like Teeling, this is another interesting twist on standard Irish whiskey and I like it."

3.25,"It wasn't bad, but I was disappointed due to the price point. First smelled blueberry on the nose, then other dark fruits, some cocoa, and bubble gum. Palate was strong oak - a little too much - and dark chocolate bitterness. Not much complexity. Very straight forward. Short bitter finish."
