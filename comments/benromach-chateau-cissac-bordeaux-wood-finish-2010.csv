3.5,Bit of sweet but not too light
3.5,"very dry, mild peat, very mild smoke, sweet & sharp notes, dark fruits,"
4.0,"Very sweet and nice smell, liquor, honey, fruity (plum). Grape and oak lightly smoky and citrus fruits. Tanin notes quite present at the taste. Peppered finish, oily and honey. Citrus notes last until the final drop. The whisky is very sweet so the 45% ABV knocks after when not being careful. Still very good."
