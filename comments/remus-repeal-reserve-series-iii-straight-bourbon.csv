4.0,"Neat. Neck pour.  Sharp on the nose.  Butterscotch.  Caramel.  Berries and cream.  Hint of almond.  The mix of high rye and low rye MGP is messing with me.  Smells familiar and then morphs a bit.

Milky mouth fell.  Heavy spice on the tongue.  Cinnamon and barrel.  On the taste the MGP butterscotch and vanilla emerge.  Those ripe red fruits hit on the finish.  Yeah lots of cherry and vanilla on the finish on subsequent drinks.

Equally delicious and disappointing.  Delicious because it’s MGP and those MGP dessert flavors are in full effect.  Disappointing in comparison to other MGP bottles I have around similar years.  That isn’t fair though because those other MGP single barrels are $40, $60 or $80 more than this.  I think the price is the hurdle.  At $50, I’d call this a must buy.  At $70-$80, this is probably my first and last Remus Special Reserve."

3.5,"I should comment on the expert scores but lets just move on.

Nose - at first I get some dill, perhaps from the 36% rye mash bill, but thankfully that's fading out. I'm getting cinnamon, heavy vanilla...more like icing on a cake, some fruity notes, hint of tobacco, and some fruity notes. 

Taste - I need to find a way to explain classic MGP. While I do think there's a touch of dill sour notes. I'm getting all kinds of older whisky notes, the tobacco, hint of leather, a lot of spice, but also younger notes with a bit more heat that you'd expect on a 50% bottle, a bit of youth in the oak, and some funky notes. 

I didn't love this when I first opened it, but I've gone full circle, this is darn good for the age and I'm pretty happy to have it. 

I'll let you decide on 85 bucks...that's a bit high for 10 and 11 year old bourbon imo, but we live in strange times with bourbon.

3.5 stars, and extremely high mark for me on a bourbon at this age, but they've really got something here. This is a much more complex bourbon than ECBP or EHT barrel proof, two highly spoken of bourbons. They do have their advantages beyond just barrel proof, but I think MGP really has something with these blends of bourbons and their disclosure."

4.0,Solid spicy bourbon
4.25,Tasted at a bourbon tasting event. Caramel and vanilla aroma with some oak. Vanilla and caramel with a touch of heat upfront. Oak and a touch of spice follows in the long finish.
