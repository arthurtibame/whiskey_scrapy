4.0,Ok I've dabbled in aged whiskies and bourbons but hadn't tried anything young.  Up to now. This distillery is just up the road and fairly young but already making award winning spirits. This whiskey is great!  Fairly priced and great to drink!

3.5,"Solid, nice initial taste of honey. A bit astringent on the finish. I generally prefer a bourbon."
1.5,"Very light spice and herbal notes, mild oak, thin, fades quick. Not very impressive"

3.0,"My review is for the Tennessee Malt Whiskey, which appears to be different than this version but I don't see the listing on Distiller.  Bold, rye-like.  Plenty of spice - nutmeg and cinnamon.  Also has an interesting off-note, reminds me somewhat of Tullamore.  Not my personal taste though it might be exactly what some are seeking out."

3.0,"I gave it three stars, and one of those is purely for the nose: intense scent of homemade marshmallows and vanilla bean cheesecake. Just love it. Sadly the sip doesn't quite follow through, coming off a bit thin and light to me - definitely sweet, but so shy I can hardly ask it to dance before it disappears. However that perfume is more than sufficient to get me interested in some of this distillery's more robust offerings..."

1.0,"Made the mistake of not noticing that this is NOT bourbon. It is a malted whiskey, and not a very good one."
4.0,"Great flavor, light bodied, and fantastic as a old fashioned or bees knees hybrid."
