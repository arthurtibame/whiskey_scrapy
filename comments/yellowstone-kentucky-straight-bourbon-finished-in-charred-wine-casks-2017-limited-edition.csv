4.0,"Wine finish is evident in the color. Fresh scent, some mint. Some earthy notes as well. Well balanced on the palate, hint of cherries and other red fruits. Barrel char as well. Sweet notes with a lingering yet pleasant spice. Very drinkable yet multifaceted enough to be interesting. 4/1/18"

3.0,"Neat; strong sweet oak nose. Sweet oaky flavor with notes of oats. Oats finish with a touch of sweetness. Sweet oaky & vanilla lingering flavor. Very chewy mouth feel throughout which I love about wheat bourbons.
Good bourbon, but not worth the price unless you enjoy oak forward bourbons.

5.0,"Vanilla, red fruits/cherry, and toffee on the nose with a hint of oak. Taste has a perfect balance of vanilla, oak, cherries, toffee, subtle cinnamon, and slight Cabernet taste. If I didn’t know it was aged in a Cab Cask, I don’t know if I would pick up on that. The 101 proof is perfect. This bourbon is too polite to kick you in the face like barrel proof does. This is my favorite non-barrel proof bourbon to date. IMHO better than Blanton’s Gold, and possibly the Pappy 15 year, certainly better than the Lot B. I’d love to blind taste those two against each other. All around full bodied, smooth and delicious taste, with no burn, and a pleasant finish. I hope each year gets better and better, but 2017 will be tough to top. 

A blend of 4, 7, and 12 yr Kentucky straight bourbons finished in charred Cabernet casks. The 4 yr is Limestone Branch the other two are believed to be Heaven Hill distillate.

MASH BILL: 
7 year = 75% Corn, 13% Rye, 12% Malt

12 year = 75% Corn, 13% Rye, 12% Malt

4 year* = 75% Local Heirloom White Corn, 13% Rye, 12% Malt

4.0,"Very nice nose of leather, oak, baking spices, caramel and vanilla.  The palate is a little thinner that I had hoped for, but many of the notes I picked up on the nose carried forward nicely.  It's not hot for the proof, but the finish is long with loads of cinnamon. The finish is where this dram shines."

3.0,This is an interesting Bourbon. Upon entry you get hit with rich balanced caramel and brown sugar with a hint of vanilla. On the mid pallate the wine influence shows with ripe berries and some spice. Finally the finish is meduim and somewhat dry with oak and tobacco notes. Very tasty but for the price I expected something closer to Blood Oath Pact 3 and sadly this is not on that level. Solid 3/5

4.0,"This is The Jam!
Excellent balance across fruit, oak, spice, brine, and corn. Great texture, cool Rainer cherries, moderate char, and subtle allspice on the finish. You’re gonna be glad you got a glass!"

4.0,"Charred wine casks, immediately evident in the color. Some brown sugar and wood in the nose. Smells like warmth on a brisk autumn night. On the palate, smooth for the proof. Very drinkable. Layered, with caramel, dough, tea, and a bit of smoke. Not getting too much wine, maybe some fruit. Decent finish. Very nice. 4/14/18"

4.25,"Absolutely loved this Limited Edition. The wine barrel notes really gave it a well rounded, red fruit & berry tone without being too sweet. It had some vanilla undercurrent with plenty of baking spice to boot. Very nicely done."

4.75,Neat.  Nose is interesting.  Get more fruit on the nose than typical bourbon flavors.  Caramel comes out when I bury deep.  Hint of spice in the background.  Woah.  This one is a spicy journey.  Initial taste is creamy with sugars on the tongue.  Taste hits the back of a throat with a hurricane of spice.  Long diverse legs.  Makes me think of a carrot cake with vanilla frosting once the overwhelming spice subsides.  Spend time with this one.  It tells a story worth patience and savoring.
