1.5,Rough. Not even close to the 10 year old.   Practically awful. Sorry. Medicinal peat. Super short finish. One try is enough.

3.0,"Not as good as 10. Tastes less well aged, rougher despite being 6% lower proof. Still, its good, love the peat.

Doesnt have the same bacon flavor as the 10, with a sort of strange taste lingering on the tongue."

null,"** Disclaimer:  This review is what I would consider a “Quick Hit”- meaning I won’t have my usual in-depth notes that I usually like to take.  The reason:  this sample was poured at Whiskyfest DC on 4/17/18.  All of these reviews will not be scored and I am actively looking to try them again at some point to do them more justice.

Oh, Laphroaig.  I usually love you so much.  This was also a special malt that wasn’t listed initially on the tasting list for the festival.  This one is a travel retail exclusive and I actually purchased a bottle from a European online store a couple of months ago but haven’t gotten around to opening.  It suffers from exactly the things I suspected would hurt it- too much oak cask influence while being pretty dry for a Laphroaig.  The typical smokiness and oily mouthfeel weren’t present.  I’ll open my personal bottle soon and run it through its paces, but this one didn’t really knock my socks off at the festival.

On a side note (and a bit of a rant):  I want to give Laphroaig my “Punk Bitches of Whiskyfest Award” for promising pours of the 25, 30 and new Cairdeas and not delivering them.  The Laphroaig rep simply said they couldn’t get the bottles in time for the festival, even though they announced them over a month ago.  Also, there are several vintages of the 25 and the 30 has been out for almost 2 years- don’t tell me you couldn’t find them.  I saw the 30yo in both stores we visited hours before the festival.  If you can’t get the new Cairdeas (I somewhat understand)- then bring an old one.  C’mon, guys.  When 2 of my Top 3 whiskies didn’t show it started the night off on a bad foot for me.  It made the 27yo Laphroaig a bittersweet tasting, as well.  More on that one a little later.

Laphroaig gets my SHAME, SHAME, SHAME vote and should have to make The Walk of Atonement..."

2.0,"“Meh.” That’s about all I can really say about this travel exclusive from Laphroaig. This dram really excels at being a flat, forgettable pour with its watery, delicate mouth feel, subdued peat smoke and fairly indiscernible differences in the wood notes. Bottled at 4O% (red flag) I really can’t recommend spending more than $30 American on a bottle. Next time you find yourself In the Duty-Free shop, save your funds for something more interesting. Give me the Triple Wood any day over this one.

An even 2/5. Bummer."

3.0,Quite meh honestly and Laphroaig is the scotch that began my whisky journey. I won’t be replacing the Four Oak or Select as they are both inferior to the base 10 year old expression.

4.0,"Undil
Nose. Very Fiery peppery hits you hard. Saltiness. Peatiness. Vanilla and caramel comes in after the first four whiffs. 

Palate. Very light on the palate, which is a pleasant surprise. Surprisingly since the nosing was intense. Almost feels like it’s been in the cask for a while. Feels the burn on the back of the throat. The flavour is light 

Finish. Nice mashmellow peatiness that lingers for a long finish. Caramel taste at the end. Personally, go for the finish because it makes it all worthwhile."

Palate: surprisingly light and watery mouthfeel that burns slightly towards the end. Not much here except smoky peat and strong wood notes.

Finish: feels like drinking an ashtray.

I can see why many dislike this whisky, but I sometimes find myself in the mood for its blatant ash-like smokiness."

4.25,"Laphroaig is doing some great whiskies lately. Well, they have always made great whiskies to be fair. This one is no exception, and it is really, really enjoyable. This ""four oak"" expression is matured in... well... four types of oak barrels: ex-bourbon barrels, quarter casks, virgin american oak and european oak hogsheads. The result was a very easy drinkable Laphroaig (if that such thing ever exists). 

Bottled at 40%abv (that is rare for a laphroaig) with an amber color. 

Well, on the nose it is what you expect from this distillery: some earthy peat, fresh can of tennis balls, dirt, heather, a lot of nice smelling oak, seaweed, burnt plastic, sawdust and... 

Ok, maybe this is embarrasing but this one has an aroma of the rubber from the head of a He-Man toy. If you ever had one, you will know what i am talking about. It is that exact aroma. Actually pretty interesting.

On the palate is just delicious. Starts super powerful for a 40%abv whisky, smoke puffs, ashes, cigarrettes and some incredibly sweet toffee note. Actually the balance on this flavors in the palate was amazing. Its sweet but peaty. 

But not everything was gold. Aftertaste is very, very short  :(

The aftertaste notes are pepper, bonfire and ashes. But it is way too short to get this whisky a remarkable score.

Overall i give it an 88 over 100 and i think this is super enjoyable and highly recommendable. Slainte!"
3.25,"Another NAS Laphroaig.  This is an interesting one that I suspect will divide opinion.

First off, it still has the typical TCP, medicinal taste up front, but this time it’s all about the smoke.  There’s a lot of character in the smoke, but it’s not as oily and full-bodied as you’d tend to expect from a Laphroaig.  I’m mostly getting a vanilla and toast, with a hint of some citrus and salt, but that’s about it.

The aftertaste doesn’t last long.  What there is is really just more of the ashiness, with a bare hint of salt and vanilla.

It does taste young and a little ashy, but it is still an enjoyable dram.  It’s lighter than many Islay and pretty unassuming.  It’s not bad, but I’d generally pick up a standard 10y/o before this one."
