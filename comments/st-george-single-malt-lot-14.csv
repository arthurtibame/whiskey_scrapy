4.0,"Definitely love the cocoa, cinnamon, and nut flavors, but there is also a sort of cherry cough syrup undertone that throws it off for me and keeps it from five stars. Certainly the most interesting and refined American malt I've tried."

2.0,"Light, thin, with a splash of fruit and little else. Acetone on the nose. If this were a brandy, it'd be great. As a whiskey, I found it lacking."

4.0,"The nose is almost floral, almost like a triple distiller Irish malt.  Once on your palette, it really changes to a cocoa forefront with a vanilla / honeysuckle, finish is almost like beer...a bit of sour in a good way.  So far, I don't think I've liked any American malts (including Balcones, Westland, and a few other), but I did like this almost as much as a Scottish or Asian. A bit pricey, but definitely better than most American malts."

4.0,"This was actually the “Baller” cask. Japanese style single malt from an American distillery. Wow what an interesting Whiskey. Very easy on the nose but smacks you with an array of flavors. I get sweetness from the barley malt, earthy, citrus and chocolate. Mild finish and lingering sweet/bitter. Definitely something to share with someone who would appreciate the complexity. Or by yourself:)"

4.0,"Tasted Lot 13. Unique and really good. Smooth, subtle bite, lots of flavors going on and I could take a while smelling and tasting to pick it all apart. Worth buying a bottle."
