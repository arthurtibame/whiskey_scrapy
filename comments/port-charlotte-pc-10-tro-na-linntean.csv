3.5,"Very strong peat, obviously, nice oily background, spicy, savory. The finish is awesome with a little added water—the smoke dissipates revealing a nice sweet peat. Looooong Peaty finish"
4.5,"Overall:  A peaty bruiser with a pleasant softer side.  

Color:  Light amber  

Nose:  Big brine hit, peat, citrus, hay, cut grass, grilled green peppers, butter, and mint, water sweetens it up a bit

Body:  Full and oily

Taste:  Buttery peat, salt, embers, fierce and monolithic initially but with time mint and vanilla emerge, water brings out more spices and some woody notes

Finish:  Long hot and spicy surge, very delicate vanilla lingers quite a while"
