4.5,"I haven't had a lot of Benriachs, but everytime i have had one, it has been wonderful. This one was no exception. When sherry whiskies go higher abv percentage, its like they are on steroids. Really amazing flavors and bold experience awaits. 

Well this is a Benriach from an independent Bottler that has yet to go into market. I had a sample of it during my time in Scotland.

Bottled at 58.7%abv, tawny color.

On the nose, perfect score. Almonds, sherry, cherry, Cognac, blackberries, tobacco, wine, marmalade, raisins bathed in chocolate, sirah or pinot noir wine. Very complex, very fancy, wonderful.

On the palate, another perfect score. Red fruits, dehydrated fruits, figs, pineapple, cheese flan. Everything surrounded in caramel. 

Aftertaste is good, not as perfect as the nose and palate. Tobacco with sherry, ginger. 

Overall i am right now in a sherry phase of my life, i crave sherry whiskies more than peaty ones lately, and this expression was simply amazing. This dram only missed 0.25 to get a 5 star score. 95 over 100 (actually 95.75) amazing dram. The owners of Benriach are the same ones as Glendronach SO YOU KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT IN TERMS OF QUALITY. sláinte!"
3.75,"I bought a bottle of this blind and hadn't opened it but got to taste it tonight. Not a crowd favorite but I liked it. Quite different, maybe pinotage grape?"
