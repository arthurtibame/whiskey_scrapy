2.0,"Whispers of caramel apple hiding beneath ethyl fumes on the nose. Pleasantly saccharine palate, with a more substantive mouthfeel than its parent whiskey. Slightly buttery texture without approaching syrupy. A little vanilla and tannins decide to join the flavor gang here. Fruitiness threatens to come out to play in the finish, but opts to wave from behind the bedroom window instead. 
  
  I would suggest going with the third and most recent batch, if the opportunity presents itself."
5.0,"88 proof specialty spirit.  Using a blend of aged spirits sourced from renowned distilleries and the average age inside the bottle is 5.5 years.  Oregon Oak has the highest concentrations of the tannin Vanillin and it shines through here.  Mouthfeel:  Medium Plus.  Nose:  Burnt Sugar, vanilla, Mineral.  Taste:  Medium heat, caramel, cooked corn.  A sipper or flavorful cocktail component."
