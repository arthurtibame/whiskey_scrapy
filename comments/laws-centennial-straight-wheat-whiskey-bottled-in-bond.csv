5.0,"An amazing whiskey, tastes like a spicy Orange Julius, with some good heat on the backend  

Nose - orange peel and cream jump right out, grain spice, some vanilla and baking spices as well
Taste - feels like a spiced creamsicle, orange zest, vanilla, grain spice, and herbs
Finish - I like this finish like I like my women: oily, hot and spicy"
