3.5,"Mash Bill: 70% corn, 20% rye, 10% malt
Peppery rye ""kick"" typical of higher-rye Bourbon mashbills
Nose: Honey, pie spices, butterscotch
Palate: Oak, ginger, rye spice and toasted cereal notes. Medium body.
Finish: Long, warm, cereal/grain and spice notes
Reported to have a lower barrel entry proof than standard."
2.25,"Sharp alcoholic finish shows young age.  Middle is very floral, nose is weak."

3.0,This is Buffalo Trace but a 4ish year. A bit young and a little ethanol but corn heavy and lots of vanilla. Great but needs a bit more aging.
