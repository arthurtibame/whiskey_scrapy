4.25,"This is a mighty tasting whiskey! On the nose I get honey, wildflower, bready & maybe flaxseed/oats,  the palate is more honey with wildflower, burnt sugar with a a hint of char and the finish is you guessed it more honey! Two thoughts, first was maybe 8 months was too long to age in the Mead barrel and secondly how this compares to the Belle Meade Honey? Cheers all!"
