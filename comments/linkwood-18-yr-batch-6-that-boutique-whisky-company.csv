4.25,Dramfest 2020. Another great TBWC dram. A couple of mates and I camped out here and tried all their range both on top and under the table. I didn't realize the Darkness was theirs as well. TBWC range they just fill from distillery cask no finishing whereas the Darkness range they do. We had a good chat to the local distributor and apparently they have a bit of a genius taster who goes around the distilleries. We also got chatting about their labels. They put a bit of thought into all of them and he explained the messaging behind them. He did say that occasionally they just give up throw out the concept and put something random in like aliens and space rays!
