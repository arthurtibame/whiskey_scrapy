4.0,"Wow, much better than I was expecting at its price point. On the nose you get a bit of a smoky smell with a faint citrus smell. The taste has a very nice spice to it along with some vanilla and cinnamon that lingers, and a creaminess that took me by surprise for a rye. Great value."

3.0,"Neat; Spicey & sweet nose. Spicey flavor with notes of oak & pepper. Light sweet finish. Mild spicey lingering flavor.
With two dashes of Angostra bitters; Becomes more spicey overall. Usually the sweet herbal flavor over rides most whiskey's but this seems to stand up to it nicely. 4/5 stars.
Had in ""The Widow's Sting"" cocktail; rye whiskey, Grand Marnier, Amaro & orange oil.
Has a sweet herbal nose. Sweet  herbal and floral flavor & finish. 4/5 stars.

I liked the spicy rye but then it became slightly so so, bit rough and the thing that did it for me was it just became to sweet. Still its only $40USD here which is cheap 3.5 I'll give it."

4.0,"Mashbill: 51% Rye, 37% Corn, 12% Malted Barley

Price: My friend brought this, but it’s $24.99 at the local Total Wine in Houston, Texas

Setting: Neat in a Glencairn, while playing Twilight Struggle with a friend

Color: Copper

Nose: I found the nose pretty faint. I picked up cereal notes and that was about it. I do wonder how long the bottle was open, however, as that may have muted some of the aromas. (16/25 points)

Taste: I loved the taste of this. Peanuts, rye spice, cereal, and cinnamon, with a nice mouthfeel. Packs some heat, but in a pleasing way. (46/50 points)

Finish: Medium duration. Maple syrup, rye spice, and cinnamon. (18/25) points)

Conclusion: I really enjoyed this. It’s not particularly complex, but it has lots of flavor and tastes good. My friend who brought it over claims that it also makes a mean Manhattan, and it’s affordable enough to use as such. I don’t have much rye whiskey experience (I like High West but haven’t tried a whole lot else), but this was quite nice, especially for the price. I’ll have to pick up a bottle.

4.0,"Rye is becoming increasingly popular, and I certainly understand why. It's flavorsome, affordable and has a bit more punch than your average bourbon. Rittenhouse from Heaven Hill is an old classic and a good starting point to explore rye. The nose is unmistakably spicy with loads of cinnamon, cloves and caramelized sugar. Gingerbread, sweet oranges and hints of floral add to the complexity. After a strong and gingery arrival, the taste develops aromatic and semidry, with notes of bitter honey, mint and wood spices lingering in the medium finish. A steal!

RATING: 3.9/5.0 stars ≙ 86 pts → FIRST-CLASS [-]"

2.75,"Rittenhouse is my first bottle of rye, so don't have a lot of comparison with others in the category, other than a quick taste of Bulleit Rye once.

Enjoyed neat in Glencairn.  Nose is odd on this one for me.  Sort of a mildly sweet woody burnt sugar mixed with a medicinal smell or hay, maybe pine, cedar, or wintergreen.  On the palate the rye spice immediately jumps on the tongue.  Quite spicy and peppery but it fades fairly quickly, leaving more of that medicinal taste that I got from the nose.  I can't quite place it, but it almost seems like a band-aid or iodine quality. Taste isn't sweet, and more on the tart side.  Also for 50% ABV, it seems fairly tame, like it could be closer to 40%.  Finish is fairly short and settles into toasted wood and honey.  Long in the finish I get a grassy note, maybe hay again.  

Overall, not a bad first entry into ryes for me but the strange medicinal quality just isn't all that appealing as a daily sip.  I've tried Bulleit rye, and it was much smoother and less spicy, which isn't typical of a rye, so I'm not sure it's a great comparison.  Although I probably prefered the Bulleit for its flavor profile.  Maybe the Rittenhouse will grow on me, but not a great first impression.  Cheers!"

3.5,"Nose of oak and peppermint transitions to vanilla and spearmint after a while. First taste is hot ethanol wrapped around a creamy, smooth, full-bodied center. Alcohol dissipates quickly, leaving fresh oak, sweet fruit, slight baby aspirin, mint, and light clove. The finish is long and satisfying, mostly oak and clove.

A little water mutes the flavor too much, leaving mainly cola flavor and a shorter, oak and cola finish.

There is no dill aroma or flavor. Clove is not nearly as pronounced as the 95% ryes from MGP.

This is a complex and satisfying dram. I’m looking forward to finishing the bottle."

4.25,"Just picked up a bottle of this for the first time in a couple of years. Thought it was a good time to re-review since my earlier review was done when I was fairly new to the brown spirit game. 

Nose: Hay, Leather, Old Oak. Like standing in an old barn or tack room. Keep exploring to pull out notes of Light vanilla and just a hint of dill way in the back. After it sits for a few minutes a custardy note starts to evolve.

Neat in a Glencairn: This one is Oakier than I remember. It enters with the Hay and leather. Just a hint of vanilla/caramel sweetness. Dusty and dry. That great musty oak note that I find in a lot of Heaven Hill presents in the mid-palate. It manages to be oaky without being bitter or tannic. No (or very minimal) dill that a lot of people find off-putting in some of the higher rye mash bills. A pleasant warming sensation paired with a peppery tingle on the finish. The musty oak note coats and lingers along with a little pepper spice. 

Splash: A couple drops of water really enhances both nose and palate. It shoves the rye notes to the back and gives the nose a fall-esque vibe. Butterscotch and nutmeg. It gives it a creamier mouthfeel with the butterscotch, vanilla and nutmeg becoming the predominant notes complimented by the heavy oak. 

Verdict: I guess I just needed a reminder of how much I liked this one. Of the ryes that I have sampled, this is a solid second place behind the High West Double Rye. The High West has a lot of notes that you don't think would pair well together (think an improv jazz session) while the Rittenhouse hits a few well placed complimentary chords (think a meat and potatoes garage band crunching out an AC/DC cover tune). Both are equally enjoyable depending on your mood."

4.25,"It's like drinking campfire marshmallows dipped in a sugary butter. It's soft on the nose, with a sugar/spice mix, but bites hard with some heat on first sip. Texture is buttery smooth, with a very sugary finish. Tastes like cake, butter cream frosting and marshmallows, and it lingers in a good way.

Of note, unlike other bourbons and ryes in my experience, this one tastes better neat. Dilution seemed to take away some of the impact of the flavor profile for me."

4.75,"Grabbed a bottle of Rittenhouse, one of my go to bottles, and first rye I ever had. 

Look: the label is red, so the spirit looks especially dark in the bottle, but in the glass comes out a more light brown, slightly golden. The rye sticks to the glass once moved around my Glencairn, with alcohol legs dissipating pretty quickly. 

Nose: I get a lot of butterscotch, cinnamon, clove, really a bunch of spice, with that butterscotch sweetness. Slight nuttiness

Palate: my first taste was like eating potpourri: cinnamon all over the place, but not in a super spicy note but almost a cinnamon granola bar. Wonderful.  The second sip brings the sweet butterscotch notes more, sugars, and clove cinnamon. 

Finish: Almost no bitterness at all, and a medium amount of heat.  The taste that lingers most would be the cinnamon that dominates the whole dram, with some earthy notes hitting a minute or so in. 

Overall: While I’ve had Rittenhouse a number of times, I never really had much of an ability to pick apart flavors, but finally having this with a little more experience, I love it. The cinnamon is beautiful, with little cloying bitterness in the finish makes this about perfect for me. I’m excited to try the big brother, Pikesville, in the near future."

4.25,"One of my personal favorite rye whiskies, full bodied and spicy but not overly hot. This rye can hold its own in a cocktail, neat, or with a big cube. Nice vanilla oaky nose, I get a lot of burnt marshmallow sweetness, some nutty and oak roundness fill the body with light maple lingering. Really nice spicy sweet finish hangs around to remind you why you came here in the first place."

Some grassy notes, strong pepper spice is nearly overwhelming the woody notes, hints of caramel and tobacco.  This is a solid rye, but is a perfect example of why I prefer a wheater.  Just not smooth at all, and the rye spice overwhelms.  5/25/19"

4.5,"Vanilla, brown sugar"
4.0,"Splendid nose of vanilla, toasted marshmallow, leather, fresh hay, and pipe tobacco. No ethanol to speak of; easy and really enjoyable to huff.

Palate follows the nose closely, but lose the leather and add caraway-seeded rye bread, brown sugar, cinnamon, black pepper, honey, and just a touch of spearmint. Spicy finish is of decent length. Flavors are nice and bold, and integrate well. 

Mouthfeel is on the thinner side, but has some creaminess and is oily enough to coat the mouth. 

A bottom shelf titan with no discernible flaws. Definitely a bourbon drinker's rye as it is on the sweet side, but seriously a BIB Rye of this quality...for $26???! Let's not tell Heaven Hill they could mark this up 50% and it would still be worth it. Automatic re-buy status for me."

I have heard these are great.  That will be for another day.  Rittenhouse Rye is a bottled in bond that is 100 proof.  This one is an amazing value as it is usually about 20-30 bucks most places.  The color is a copper color.  The aroma is a light spiciness with caramel and vanilla.  The palate is a rush of spice with brown sugar and vanilla.  It seems very thick and coating on the tongue which I like.  The finish is long with the spice hanging in there and a little sweetness."

4.0,"Distinct from other rye offerings with its focus on core rye bread and spice character, Rittenhouse Rye opens with rye bread, cinnamon, caraway, clove, nutmeg, cherries, dark maple, and black tea in the nose. Here, caraway steals the show, both for its prominence and its distinctiveness among the notes typical of other ryes. The palate reveals more citrus character, biting rye spice, baked apples, pumpernickel, black tea, orange rind, black soda, and then dries neatly into a drawn out finish which introduces at last menthol to its layered presentation of rye spice character. Warming, with a powerful spice character."

On the palate it is sweet, but not cloyingly so; balanced by rye spiciness: cinnamon and nutmeg. A little hot, but to be expected at 100 proof. Finish is long, spicy, and sweet oak. With water, it becomes lighter and spicier, and more complex. This has to be one of my favorite whiskies, and at the price point is hard to beat."

3.75,"Following up on my review of Pikesville Straight Rye is this review for its younger cousin, Rittenhouse Bottled-in-Bond Rye. The information I could find for this Heaven Hill offering seems to vary a bit depending on where you look and I couldn’t locate an official Heaven Hill specifications page for it. In any case, feel free to chime in if you are aware of one - this is the best I could find for now. 

Mash Bill: 51% Rye, 37% Corn, 12% Malted Barley
Age: 4 years
ABV: 50%
Price: $19.99 (typically seen for $20-$25)

Nose: Surprisingly soft and mellow. Dusty cherries, malty grains, breakfast cereal. Buttery oiliness. I wish it was socially acceptable to have this for breakfast. 

Palate: Rich, oily mouthfeel with gentle rye spice. Peaches and cherries, vanilla, nutmeg, smokey char, and little bits of flake salt. 

Finish: Medium length. Sweet and fruity, with mild spice, smoke, and amber maple syrup sweetness.

Overall Impressions: Not quite as intense or complex as the Pikesville, but still very good in its own right. I think this bottle has either softened a bit since I first first opened it or I have been drinking too much rye lately. It doesn’t seem nearly as spicy as it used to be so I’m curious how the next bottle I crack open will compare. In any case, this is a remarkable bottle for the price (~$20) and something that will always be in my home bar. It is excellent neat or as a mixer. I highly recommend this take a place on your shelf too!

3.75,"Outstanding value, in a whiskey world where it can be very hard to find.
Nose is very soft but generous with dark cherry dominating, hints of butterscotch, rye notes, and a whiff of ethanol. The mouthfeel follows through on the nose, very soft, with rounded full edges. On entry cherry and baked/browned soft apple fruit gives way ever so easily to very well balanced rye spice that blends nicely with notes of dark chocolate. The rye spice moves from back to front, tickling even the lips. The finish, although a bit abrupt/short, fades nicely into cocoa and barrel notes. While not an aggressive, punchy rye, overall a well balanced, soft, delicious pour that delivers just enough rye spice to keep most rye fans happy. Not a single note in this pour could be labeled as unpleasant."

Initial tingle on the tongue, then cherries, brown sugar, mint, rye bread.  Still some noticeable sourness on the otherwise short finish.

This brings me to price point.  This is not an uncut, unfiltered party in your mouth.  It is, however, a decent sipping bourbon.  I miss the thick, sweet flavors of say Knob Creek but would take this over Buffalo Trace at the price point.  Not one I lust over or would likely buy again but nothing to regret either. 

Random update - paired with a rice krispy treat this was absolute heaven.  You know, for those of you who are into that sort of thing..."

Lots of pretty rye flavors.  Caramel, Those fruity notes from the nose, stick around, plus some oak, char, allspice, rye grass, hint of vanilla.  Each sip seems to bring something new.  The finish has some caramel sweetness, cinnamon, oak tannins, and some building burn.  The alcohol and medium light mouthfeel and the finish keep it from being cloying.

Overall a very nice drink, especially for the price and readily available.  Great place to start if you want to see if rye is for you, as it is a 'barely legal' rye at 51%"
3.75,"Big fan of Pikesville so eager to try this younger sibling. Poured neat, nice color and coating of my rocks glass. Nose has baking spices and smoky wood with some floral aspects. Cinnamon and rye round it out. Palate is bold spice and sweet wood with the rye taking on some fruity notes like a cognac. Graham cracker and cinnamon in the background add body. Finish is drying wood and char with the baking and cinnamon spice fading slowly. This is very tasty rye. Drinks more like a high rye bourbon to be honest. At $28 paid offers a strong value as well........88/100.........No slight to Ritt but Pikesville is on another level with the depth, maturity of flavors, vibrancy and overall experience. Ran them side by side and its clear. Worth the extra $$ imo..........if you are a fan of Rittenhouse than you will love Pikesville. Both are top notch ryes"

I bought this to make Manhattans and other whiskey cocktails. Previously, I used Bulleit Rye. I didn't care for it neat, but it was a solid mixer. Then, my family gifted me a bottle of Axe and the Oak Colorado Incline Rye. It was very floral when drank neat, but disappeared in a Manhattan. 
This, though, holds up neat and in a cocktail. The Rittenhouse is spicier and hotter like cinnamon. There's some good heat on the tongue and back of the throat. I like it alot. In a Manhattan, it holds its own with my preferred vermouth Carpano Antica. The higher ABV (50%) keeps it from disappearing when mixed. I really enjoy that bit of earthiness it adds to my drink on the finish. 

Overall, it's a solid rye for your cocktail bar."

4.0,"There's no messing around here, Rittenhouse gets straight to the rye spice which is complemented with the slightly higher ABV. Notes of almond and clove and value for money all over the place."
4.0,Can't go wrong with this rye.

3.5,"Good salted caramel, herbal, and rye bread flavor, but the nose is pretty lackluster, makes a 4-star whiskey into a 3.5 IMO. Despite that it makes a great old fashioned."

3.5,"I'm embarking on the seven seas of rye. I am always keen to expand my experience and this is where I am.

It's a good place.

The nose. Inviting. Raisins. Oranges. A touch of spice sweet end. Typical caramel and cocoa. The taste... Chewable. Pine perhaps, just a hint. I like the oak level. 

Not a huge finish but pleasantly sweet..warm.

Fine vfm. Comfortable and glugs like a champ."

3.0,"Light copper in color. Lots of oak in the Aroma and more wood notes than I remember.  Rather light Aroma overall.  Does open up with some baking spice and notably cinnamon.  Not a great deal of sweetness in aroma or flavor.  On the palate there is much more heat than other recent 100 proof items I've had.  Couple drops of water brought out more pepper and Rye spice while muting the alcohol heat.
I typically infuse my Rittenhouse with roasted peanuts and love it in that way. I will continue to enjoy in that fashion vs drinking in its original form."
3.75,Great for Manhattan's if you don't like them sweet

4.0,"Color: surprising nice copper/gold.  The bottle doesn't do the color justice.  3.75 on the color scale

Legs: slow forming evenly spaced and slow running down the sides.  3.5

Nose: spicy sweet, low hints of the oak/Carmel and more pronounced clove or black pepper, hint of mint. 4.0

First taste: ultra smooth, perfect viscosity, not a lot of burn on the tongue for a 100 proofer (BiB) 4.0

Taste: really nice balance of spice and traditional rye notes with enough sweetness to take most of the harshness of a rye away.  4.25

Finish: Again, pleasantly surprised by it's easy going nature, minimal burn and consistency from nose through finish. 4.25

Overall: this is a steal of a bottle at $27.  I'm adding this to my best under $50 list and will be on the lookout for more product out of this brand.  Going to go 4.0 overall with a price/value score of 4.5."

4.25,"Very aromatic nose. Cherry and vanilla on the nose for me. Maybe some brown sugar. Rye notes for sure and some perfume on the nose. Nosing too deeply definitely presents some alcohol burn. To taste, sweet at the start but definitely rye forward. Black pepper mid palate and spice. Some alcohol burn on the taste, but it’s minimal for this proof. Surprisingly getting a note of... corn (?)... on the finish this tasting. Amazing value for a rye."

3.25,This is decent. Good for the price point. The mash bill seems to be part bourbon and part rye. Not much on the nose. It has a bittersweet palate on the front with a long spicy finish. Great to have on hand for cocktails but decent enough to drink neat.

2.75,"I'm going to level with you, this thing is straight cinnamon, albeit a good, dry cinnamon. 

Yes, there are notes of black pepper, spicy fruit peel, and even a little char. But to call this anything other than a straight up cinnamon bomb would be underselling exactly how Cinnamon-y this thing really is. 

It's too cinnamon forward for me personally, but I'll bet it would make a hell of a mixer, and it's a considerable upgrade from Fireball. 

I did pour this into a glass of Coke Zero with ice, and as much as the cinnamon is tempered by the cola, it still is overpowering everything in its path. If you like cinnamon this is a very good budget rye that I would recommend, just understand that it is going to be the dominant factor in any mix you put it in."

4.25,"Rye spice and cherry on the nose. Palate is rich and oily and a little sweet for a Rye, but it’s well balanced with the spiciness you’d expect. Excellent Rye for the price. This has earned a place in my bar."
