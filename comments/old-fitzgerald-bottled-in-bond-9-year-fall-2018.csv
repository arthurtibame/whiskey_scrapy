4.0,"Nose: Vanilla. Toasted oak. Nutty. Wood shavings. Coconut. Slight coffee. After sitting, more brown sugar and spice. 

Palate: Fruited. Spice. Leather. Peanut. 

Finish: Cinnamon spice, nutty, lingering. 

Overall: A balanced pour. I enjoyed the nose best, a lot going on there and I found it changes nicely as I sipped. Throughout the palate and especially on the initial finish, there was a nuttiness that seemed to pop. Not my favorite note to find in a finish, particularly when perceived to be so apparent. It’s hard for me to fall head over heels on my first tasting. I’ll update if this changes. To be more specific, I’d rate this bourbon around a 3.8/5. It’s in line with a lot of other Heaven Hill products I’ve tried, so if you’re a big fan of most of their offerings, I think you’ll likely really enjoy this. And yes, the decanter will look great on your shelf. A solid addition at retail, personally wouldn’t recommend venturing too far past."

4.75,"Before I get into the review of this wonderful and rare Bourbon, I'd like to share with you my experience hunting it today! 
It's a crisp Arizona winter morning and I have a number of conference calls in the early part of the day. I have a window between 11 and 12:30 where I can grab lunch. I decide to go hunting after my lunch and hit some liquor stores I know receive fresh inventory on Friday. The first one I hit has nothing of note, however, the owner talks me into a French Single Malt aged in used Congac Casks. He proclaims it's the Whiskey he would take to a deserted island. I agree to buy it. He goes to the back to find a bottle and after several minutes he tells me he is sold out. It's almost 12:30 and I need to run to make sure I make my next meeting. I check my work phone and find the meeting is pushed to 1pm. I think to myself, I can hit one more liquor store before my meeting. Off I go and as I arrive I am met with a fresh case of ECBP at $61 a bottle. SCORE!. As I go to pay I notice a decanter that I recognize as an Old Fitz bottle. ""How about that one?"" I inquired. The owner says he doesn't know but it came in today. He consults the inventory sheet left by the distributor and says, ""I'll sell it to you for $85"". I asked to see the bottle and sure enough it was the old Fitz. I said for this bottle $85? He said, ""sure why not"". I pulled the trigger instantly. He then asked me, ""Is this a special bottle or something?"" I told him he could definitely get a lot more for it, to which he said ""I am making my money, you enjoy it"". 
I share this story to illustrate that finding rare Whiskey at retail does really involve searching (hunting) and just some blind luck. But also to share that some retailers are honest folks who are happy to make their profit and not gauge! Now this bottle goes for up to $500 online and averages $300+. So I am very happy and grateful to this liquor store owner for selling it at a fair price! Now enough of the preamble and onto the main event!
On the pallette it's so mouth coating and viscous. At 100 proof I have never had such an oily Whiskey. It's so smooth and velvety leading with vanilla, butterscotch and raisans with toasted oak in the background. As we move to the mid pallette you get a clove pop with oak, vanilla and red fruits leading to a long oak and mint driven finish. The finish goes on and on. You ponder this dram for long after the final sip. It's lovely. Probably the best sub $100 Bourbon I have had to date. I am deducting a 1/4 point for a slight lack of complexity. It's a very minor deduction, however, when compared to the EH Taylor Single Barrel from 2018, for an extra $20 it is not much more complex. Minor critique from an otherwise near perfect Bourbon.
Cheers all!"
5.0,Solid bourbon. Dark for 9 year old. Pleasant nose. Extremely smooth and full. Seek and you will be rewarded.
4.75,I loved this one. Professional reviews seemed right on. Coconut and vanilla. I prefer it with a big rock. One of my all time favorites!

4.5,The pro taste notes are pretty accurate.  Right balance of sweet and spice at the end.  Very smooth.  This does not have the bitter aftertaste i got from the older 11 year version.

Carmel, orange peel, clove and a nice oak char... lingering finish with a nice kick. Love this stuff!"

3.75,"Nose: Brown sugar, caramel, warm vanilla, deep wood, marshmallow, butter popcorn.

Palate: Creme brulee, leather, the oak notes are very pronounced, there's a light berry note that comes through on the finish, with vanilla cream, finishing in very fleeting spice. 

Thoughts: A beautiful bourbon, that given its impressive bottle, rich heritage, and allocation leaves a little something to be desired. The nose and palate are both great, lots of rich flavors with butter and caramel really popping. Unfortunately, the biggest letdown is the definitively short finish. It seems to linger for just a second before just falling into the abyss. It took me a couple of sips to really get a feel for this bourbon and all its characteristics. A nice bottle to have in a collection, and a treat when you get to try it."
4.5,"Nose: sweet toffee and caramel.  Really pleasant. I didn't detect much else, but it gets high points from me because of how nice it is.  No alcohol fumes. 

Taste: sweet, viscous, full. More caramel. Not much spice, but a little towards the back. No tannins.  

Finish: long, smooth, sweet, slightly spicy.  

Very nice whiskey!"

4.75,"Getting down towards the bottom of my bottle of this, and realized I never got around to reviewing it. 

Nose - cinnamon graham crackers, apples, pie crust, lemon zest, vanilla, and oak

Palate - Rich, mouth-coating flavors of caramel, graham crackers, cinnamon and baking spices. Lingering finish follows with brown sugar, cinnamon and oak. Not hugely complex but there's enough spice to balance the sweetness and keep it interesting.

This is a really great bourbon. I'd say it's easily the second best wheated bourbon I've had, behind William Larue Weller."
4.25,After the first two tastes the sweetest high notes of chocolates balanced with a musty grain.
4.5,"Neat.  The coconut is there and that is interesting.  Vanilla, almost a Belgian waffle in the nose.  Such a nice creamy mouth.  Vanilla ice cream on the taste and a pastry fluffiness lingers.  Eventually gives way to a slight spice, cinnamon.  Quite a treat."

3.75,"Nose- fairly astringent with strong brown sugar 
Body-Strong brown sugar and burn continue. Actually tastes higher proof than it is.
Finish- The best part, sweet brown sugar, cinnamon, and just really nice. 

The more I drink the more I like it."
4.0,"The first several pours were really excellent after allowing it a little time to open up. Has a rare coconut note for me that make it feel special. Palate also has a little hay, golden raisin and a ton of vanilla. Excellent mouthfeel!"

4.5,Very special from start to finish. The nose has a pleasant smooth sweetness of vanilla caramel with gentle oak and coconut highlights. The taste is complex with the aromas melding into an earthiness and subtle fruitiness. The finish is appropriately long and fades without a heavy bite. The bottled in bond alcohol content does not overpower this fine Kentucky tipple.

4.5,"Very smooth, wheater, not as sweet as a owa but has those notes"
4.0,"Oak heavy. Vanilla Nose, brown sugar, honey, reminds me of Weller Special Reserve on the nose. Then slaps me across the face and says NOPE. almost overly oaked on the taste. small vanilla. lingering bitter on the finish.  reminds me of burnt sugar cookies."

4.0,Let this open up. I was absolutely distressed when I opened this and drank from it night one.... let it sit for about 2 weeks after some air got to it from 3 people drinking out of it. Holy cow the flavors come out. Super vanilla. It’s great after it opens up
4.25,"The nose is full of charred oak along with baking spices that can bite if you’re not careful. Vanilla, brown sugar, caramel, leather and touches of ripe fruit and peanuts follow all nicely in balanced with each other. The oak and baking spices carry over strongly to the palate for a slightly dry and chewy mouthfeel, backed up by the sweeter notes of vanilla, brown sugar and caramel while pleasant notes of peanut fill the mouth with a little smoke coming at the end. The finish is medium long spicy along with oak that lasts as the rest of the palate fades behind it."

4.25,"The nose is light and lacking much depth, on the pallet it's nice, and then the finish hits you with an unexpected oak bomb which is really nice. AMAZING decanter bottle and the bourbon inside is great too, a must buy if not marked up in price too much."

4.25,I’m tasting this again this time next to the 13yr. The nose now seems ordinary. I can’t say enough about the nose in the 13. Taste is still lovely but I the heat lasts a little longer in the finish. I still am a big fan but I’m ur complexity of the 13 year mutes my feelings in this one.
4.25,My last of this fine bottle. It will be missed.
4.5,"Nose- sweet caramel, raisins, green apples, vanilla, lemons, brown sugar

Palate- vanilla cream, peanuts, lemon, brown sugar, honey, floral (lavender/wild flowers) 

Finish- Medium, creamy finish with lovely notes peanuts, citrus, and toasted oak 

This is fantastic. I’m convinced that there is no bad Old Fitz. Nice and complex nose, with the highlights being the sweet citrus and heavy brown sugar. The palate opens up with a sweet vanilla cream that leads to peanut butter and lemon citrus. The finish brings forth a creamy viscosity that seems to last a good while, but could be longer. The 13 and 15 are better, but the 9 is still amazing and something I would drink any day of the week"
4.0,Very Good! But prefer the 11yr
