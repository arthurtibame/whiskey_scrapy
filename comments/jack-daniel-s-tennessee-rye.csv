2.0,This tastes young and almost like a hot mess! I got the obvious banana flavors along with rye but it overall was short too much going at once and overall tasted young ! I commend JD for finally bringing a 90 proof product to the table!

3.25,"I like this a lot.  It's a good addition to the J.D. lineup and really better than old #7 in many ways. A moderate floral nose with hints of the spiced rye overtones about to be embibed.  
    
    Mild rye body as expected, nothing strong or harsh, just smooth rye flavors and with powerful banana nut and toasted oat hints as well as spicey proof spirits.  There are any number of mixable combos for this one and clear or club soda w/ lemon as the folks at Lynchburg suggest, certianly has merit.   This just works really well and is a great if unexpected offering from JD. 
   
Update: (reflecting the half star rating) this is a great rye for someone looking for a NON-traditional rye, a sweeter almost bourbon-rye cross, which is something like what Old Forester managed with it's rye offering.  Just something to note for those interested in a less than traditional, but interesting rye flavor profile."

3.0,"Based on some pretty solid reviews, I grabbed a bottle of this straight rye from Jack Daniels. This is not the single barrel version, as the local liquor store I was at didn’t have it. Bottled at 45% ABV, this is a natural color of dark copper and it is most likely chill filtered. 

Strong rye and oak on the nose up front. The ever present bananas and walnuts found in all JD whiskies soon takes center stage. Caramel corn, candy corn and toffee move in, never quite overtaking the bananas. Mint and dill in just the right amount for my tastes. It’s somewhat bitter and I got a metallic note and oddly enough a whiff of chlorine which faded fast. Sweet and spicy. Buttered rye toast. More and more bananas and walnuts. 

A fairly sweet palate with bananas all over the place. Walnuts, corn, rye and oak. Mildly spicy. Dill, caramel and butterscotch. A rather simplistic palate, but I’m guessing this is a fairly young rye. 

Medium bodied mouthfeel, a little thin feeling and dry. 
Medium long finish with, you guessed it, bananas, walnuts and rye. 

As much as I don’t want to admit it, this is a good whiskey. I’ve had the Old #7, Gentleman Jack, Single Barrel and that weird cider stuff and in my opinion, and it’s just that, this is the only JD worth drinking neat. It’s pretty good with a little ice too. It’s not too complex, but it’s good in its simplicity. Like all JDs though, it’s a bit overpriced. Paid $30 for it, but I think it should be sub $25. As it is, it’s still worth buying. My hat’s off to you on this one Mr. Daniels.  3.75
Cheers"

4.0,"JD Rye (tried neat in a glencairn) has a sweet nose. Redolent of Juicy Fruit Gum and bananas with just a hint of the dill note found in ryes lurking in the back. Some time in the glass brings out some oak. It enters light on the palate. Again, Juicy Fruit Gum, Banana Cream Pie, Vanilla, peanut and light oak. You don't pick up the spicy, tingly rye until the back end where it pairs with a slight jolt from the 90 proof. Finishes lightly astringent with with the banana and oak coating and lingering. A few drops of water really amps up the banana and brings a note of sweet tea to the mix, but mutes the rye tingle. My experience with JD is the standard expression and the Gentleman. This leaves both in the dust. I really liked it. I have yet to try it in a cocktail, but be prepared if using in an Old Fashioned or Manhattan that the Lincoln County Process leaves this sweeter and less spicy than most ryes and even some Bourbons. I applaud JD for a unique product. You have your barely legal 51% ryes (Beam, WT, Rittenhouse, etc) and your 95% ryes (any number of MGP sourced juice), but this one is unique at 70% rye and the LC Process. For under $30, I will definitely buy again."

2.0,"I feel I have to start this review by stating I am not a fan of Jack No7. I would rate that Whiskey as a 1/5.
I however was very curious to see how Jack would do with a Rye. I finally decided to pick up a 50ml bottle from Total Wine for $1.99 to give it a taste!
Upon entry you get that classic Jack Maple and vanilla note. From there you get a big rye and cinnamon spice swell on the mid pallette. Finish is short with some oak and plenty of spice. It runs very hot for 45% abv. However, it's much smoother than the old No 7.
For a $20 rye, it's actually not too bad. It was also pleasant as a neat sipper and would probably make a mean Manhattan.
I would give this a 2.5/5. If you are a fan of Jack then I think this will be very good to you. For all others, you could do worse, but it would not be a rye I sought out. It does however make me want to explore the single barrel version."

3.25,"Jack Daniel’s Rye is the Tennessee distiller’s fourth rye expression in recent years, and utilizes a nice fairly high rye percentage of 70% in the mashbill.  While there is no formal age statement, word on the street is around 4 to 5 years, and it is also filtered in the traditional Jack process through maple charcoal.  And have to give JD credit in actually producing their own rye product in house, instead of sourcing from MGP which is very common these days from NDPs.

Enjoyed neat in a Glencairn, no added water.  The nose is immediate and strong and certainly unlike other traditional ryes I’ve tasted.  In all honesty, at first it reminded me of something familiar but I couldn’t place it right away.  Reminded me of a more traditional bourbon actually, and more specifically I think it smells very close to one of my very favorites, Wild Turkey 101.  I think the reason is that the nose on JD Rye is giving off lots of sweet fruitiness for me, and specifically cherry dominate but also a backnote of typical JD banana, mixed with vanilla and pepper spice, and an undernote of charred oak to round it out.  There might be a touch of eucalyptus in there too, which is the only nod to traditional rye I could pick out.  Minus the little hint of banana, this is almost the exact profile of the Wild Turkey 101 nose, which for me is also cherry syrup heavy, spice, vanilla, and oak.  The JD Rye smells like a bourbon!  But I think the similarity ends here.

Palate is medium bodied and doesn’t really coat the mouth.   It is, for a brief moment, initially somewhat sweet but quickly turns a bittery tart. You are greeted with a pretty high peppery bite with a little warmth that wakes the taste buds for sure and warms the chest going down, with the rest of the taste being pretty tart.  Some fruity and slightly herbal flavor is present with a backnote of alcohol graininess and oak.  Also this is a very very drying sip leaving the mouth puckered.   Given the sweetness and familiarity of flavor on the nose, the palate is anything but familiar here.  Strange really, but not unenjoyable.

Finish is medium length and fruity, almost peachy like, with notes of honey, vanilla, lingering pepper, and light toasty barrel char all fading in and out at random.  The more the palate adjusts to the flavors, the toasty oak barrel becomes more prominent and pretty nice. Also dry and astringent on the finish.  

Overall, not bad or unenjoyable per se, but a very unique rye profile. Nothing about the JD Rye is like any other rye I’ve tried, save for the high pepper notes, which dominate this expression.  I’ll say this one is worth a try before you commit to a $30 bottle.  At the very least, grab the $2 trial vial on the shelf and give it a go, you might be surprised at this unique rye from JD!    Cheers!"

3.25,"Appearance: The color on this Tennessee styled rye was a darker tawny. The legs of the inside of the glass were medium sized and pretty oily.

Nose: On the nose I picked up a delectable assortment of caramel, oak, honey, wildflowers, and rye grain notes, (The smell reminded me a lot of how Four Roses smells.), with additional notes of black licorice, and dill. After I added a splash of water the nose was ruined and basically nothing but floral.

Taste: The palate definitely possessed a rye spiciness, some light dill, ginger, and a touch of cigar smoke and ash notes. But after I added a splash of water the palate also got really dull.

Finish: The finish was medium length; it was still spicy but not hot going down.

Thoughts: Jack made a good product with this one; and I would recommend this whiskey and would buy it for myself again! I enjoyed this dram! Thanks, Jack Daniel's! Keep up the good work! Cheers!"

4.0,"I like rye, I’m from the land of “rye” whisky but it’s hard to find a real Canadian rye that is a gem. So I’m stuck with Millstone 100 and a lot of American rye. For mass produced, column distilled swill, this preforms. 

Nose is unmistakably Jack, as it should be, but with substantially more going on. Brown sugar, white glue, banana bread and a hint of sweet licorice. Alcohol is present but far from dominating, impressive for a 45% rye. 

Biggest, and most amazing thing on the palate is the mouthfeel. Like drinking room temperature olive oil. Sweet, cinnamon spice, banana bread again and a lovely burnt orange oil note comes through at the end. I want to say I was finding some dill, but only when mixed with Pepsi, I couldn’t distinguish it neat. 

Where the palate ends with some fresh ground black pepper, that carries through the mid-long finish. Slightly drying, tannic effect that just makes you want another sip. 

Could it be better? Yes, but what couldn’t. Admirable foray into the world of rye, and extra points for not using mgp juice. Bottom line: it’s worth it, but expect it to be unapologetically Jack Daniels"

3.25,"Bought this just to try something new in the rye department. The JD single barrel rye was pretty fantastic so I decided to try the standard offering. The standard JD rye is bottled at 45% ABV from a mashbill of 70% rye, 18% corn, and 12% malted barley. It pours a medium amber in the glass and produces slow forming legs with some water droplets. 

On the nose there’s a little alcohol burn, JD profile, burnt caramel, bananas and peanuts. Not what you’d expect from a 70% rye. The Lincoln county process definitely makes a difference here. 

The palate is dry with an oily mouthfeel, more caramel and peanuts, and baking spices on the back end. The finish is fairly short with barrel char, dark sugar, some pepper and rye spice finally making an appearance. 

This whiskey doesn’t fit in any pre-defined category. A 70% rye whiskey should be spicy with lots of cinnamon and pepper. This is not that. It doesn’t have the bourbon sweetness, but it’s light in the spice department as well. All that being said, it’s not bad. And at $22 a bottle, it makes the best Manhattans I’ve had in a long time. This might be my new favorite Manhattan mixer. 3.25/5."

On the nose I get a delicate, almost faint perfumey rye, with sweet vanilla, freshly baked banana bread. 

The palate is fairly sweet and has a thicker mouthfeel. Sweet Vanilla really stands out, with the rye as a secondary note.

The finish is medium-long. With lingering sweet vanilla and a little barrel char, which causes a slight bitterness in the back and sides of the tongue. Not a bad thing.

This one is more pleasant than  standard JD, or even Gentlemen Jack. Though  I’m not getting a ton of rye, like one would expect being categorized as one. It’s fairly sweet and syrupy and not really offensive."

In the world of inexpensive rye this is on par with Old Forester Rye although I lean to Old Forester Rye in that it offers more flavor layers.

Palate: Sweetness, barrel, but more vanilla. Second sip I get more barrel astringency, but again, that sweet vanilla. Little spice in this bottle. 

Finish: Wood, slight bitterness, and apples. 

Overall: When I first tried this in Nashville, I asked the waiter if he poured me honey whiskey. I was skeptical when he told me it was the rye. A year later, I finally bought a bottle, and he was right. This is an incredibly sweet rye, and I’d say worth an adventure for the price."
