Light, mellow flavors with a short, unmemorable finish. If the proof wasn't already so low, I'd say this would be a nice summer pour with an ice cube. Instead, I might try using this bottle for an infusion and serve with a non-dilutive chilling method."

3.0,This one is just ok. A little bland/mild up front. I'm making whiskey sours with this one. Not for sipping neat.
2.0,"This bourbon seems like a way for Brown Foreman to get a few extra bucks for Old Forrester by repackaging it. It tastes pretty much like it to me (see my review of Old Forrester), cherry cough syrup aftertaste and all. When this bottle is gone, I won't be getting another. Meantime, I will use it for Old Fashioneds or just disguise it with ginger ale. 

Note that I gave this one less star than Old Forrester because it costs more and tastes like a marketing ploy."
3.0,Bought while home in TN. Wanted something different and I got it. Easy drinking smooth bourbon. Not much to it but a good everyday bourbon.

3.0,"First off, for the folks at Distiller: it's Coopers' Craft. Coopers', plural possessive. As in the craft of more than one cooper; not ""cooper's,"" as in just one of them. Second: while this whiskey won't blow anyone away, I do think it's a bit better than some of the reviews suggest. The nose in particular is quite nice, rich, evocative, and way bigger than you'd expect for a lowly 41.1% ABV--vanilla, icing suger, cake batter, huge white peach, plum (stone fruits more generally), slight berry fruits. Faint milk chocolate, a bit of slight lactic sourness that's actually not unappealing, some nice herbal/floral character (like a rose water?). But things start to come apart a bit on the taste, which is thin, watery, and leads with pencil shavings. There's some nuttiness, some sour peaches, a bit of baking spice, and something faintly cheap scotch-like. Faint grape drink, some more sour/lactic character (this time less appealing). Over time, you do get some apple and pear, a touch of leather. Finishes hot, gingery, with some unintegrated fresh wood, bitter chocolate, and dried fruits. Lingering herbal . . . green-ness. If the taste could follow through on the nose a bit better, this might be worth taking a flyer on. But as is, it's hurt by the combo of high(-ish) price, low-ABV, and too much youth. I'll join the chorus below me, agreeing that this is probably going to be consumed largely in cocktail form."

4.25,"Cooper's Craft has a light, tan appearance, with no real alcohol legs, that I could see. The aroma is of bold vanilla, with charred oak and very mild corn notes. The flavor is of an up-front charred oak, with somewhat odd bitterness (from the char?). One also detects mild (bland?), sweet corn and a shadow of dried fruit. Mouthfeel is medium, and Cooper's Craft has a long finish. I got this 750 ml bottle on special- $9.99, plus tax. RJT"

3.75,"Nose: For the first time ever, I get a strong banana smell from a bourbon. I had read other’s reviews that stated they smelled banana, but I thought they must be stoned.  I totally get it now.  

Taste: Sweet.  Banana does come through, but not a dominant flavor.  Honestly, just a very simple, mild bourbon. Great beginner’s drink. A little too sweet for me, but I’m a fan of high rye and high proof juice.  

Finish:  Mellow.  Sweetness turns into a more earthy, oak flavored. Represents the Coopers well at the end.  

Overall:  I like it.  A lot.  Really grows on you.  Definitely on the milder side.  Would make for a great summer neat pour.  Would also be great in cooking due to the sweetness.  Great buy at $20."

3.0,"This is quite a good value bourbon right off the top, average nose and subdued flavor characteristics are inoffensive to nearly any whiskey drinker and still offering some tartness and hints of carmels and other sweet flavors.  No memorable ""special"" flavoring in the profile just a good stock character that lets you enjoy it.  Finish leaves a slight tart(green apple) and mild warmth.   Totally drinkable for the average occasion.   Typically found in  the 20$ range in cities, give it 2.5 for flavor and another .5 for price point value."

3.0,"Sweet nose with a rather varied taste. I don’t get too much of the charcoal filter taste like Dickel, but it is still sweet. (vanilla mostly) It is a nice and smooth sipper indeed. The $25 PA price makes this a must buy, well worth it. Nice work BF.  This is my



 first pour impression, so let’s see how it does down the road. 
A 2nd try and a slight downgrade this taste. There is a taste I can’t put my finger on and it isn’t pleasant. It doesn’t ruin it for me, but it makes me think this will be my only bottle."

2.25,"Mini bottle poured neat into Glencairn at home.  First time I ever noticed this brand, have no expectations one way or the other.  Nose has cinnamon and vanilla, some butterscotch.  Pleasant, if perhaps a touch too sweet.  Taste is more spicy at the front, then bittersweet with some char, raisins, and peanut shells.  Bordering on odd.  Taste is a letdown from the nose, and the lingering aftertaste is not very nice.  Looks like Cooper's will be a one and done for me.  6/8/19"

2.75,"So, I was in my local spirits store looking for a cheap bourbon for making my favorite whiskey cocktail:  Bourbon & Coca Cola.  I usually just settle for different Jim Beam varieties, but I thought I mix it up (as long as it was at the same price point or cheaper).  It just so happens that this bottle was on sale this week for $16.99 (750ml).

Let’s do a quick review for a neat pour and then a sentence or two about how well it tastes with a splash of Coke, and over ice.  First, it’s bottled at 41.1% ABV and pours a rich sunset/mahogany.  It’s very oily with fat, undefined legs and a train of tiny drops around the glass after a quick spin.

The nose is spiced apples with cinnamon and a hint of caramel.  Light rye notes also mingle with fresh sawdust and vanilla.  The palate is mellow, at first, with orchard fruit and slightly more vanilla.  The backside reveals harsh oak and rye spice.  It has a light mouthfeel, which doesn’t bode well for mixing it, but it’s decent as a neat dram.  The finish is weak vanilla, apples and oak casks.  It’s relatively short and inoffensive.

Mixed with Coca Cola, it’s dramatically different than my usual Beam & Coke:  absence of bananas makes for a more citrusy cocktail and it does seem more lively than my typical go to.  It’s a fine way to mix things up.

As a score, neat, it’s 2.5 stars.  As a cocktail, it’s slightly higher.  If I can keep scoring this for $17 I’d gladly use it as a change of pace.  Cheers."

3.75,"The nose is very fruity with plenty of apple and pear covering up slight hints of vanilla and caramel, while dry oak occasionally let’s you know it’s there. The palate begins to dry out the longer you hold it in your mouth, as the fruity notes blend pleasantly with oak, while rye surprisingly makes an appearance. The finish is medium that sees the palate as a whole come together and fade nicely. This is a very simple and easy to drink bourbon, but just because it is simple does not mean it should be underestimated."

2.5,"Visiting family in VA and thought I'd see if I could find something not available here in NC. I found two, Cooper's Craft and the new Tin Cup Rye. The CC up first...

Nose: Definite Brown-Foreman/Old Fo nose, but with the addition of a light floral, fruity note and none of the Latex Paint I usually get from BF. Perhaps from the Beechwood and Birch filtering? 
Neat: A little thin. Cherry Cola, Vanilla, Bitter Citrus Peel,  Harsh Oak, Some Leather, but overall fairly flat and unremarkable. A little Sting on the finish and it coats with the Bitter Citrus, Oak and a little of the Cherry Vanilla.
Splash: A little water gets rid of a lot of the bitterness and transitions the sweet to straight vanilla. Even though you lose some notes, it actually makes it a little more palatable. I can see this being a good one to enjoy with a large cube or mixed with Coke/7Up, etc.
Verdict: If this were priced in the neighborhood of Beam and EW Black maybe I wouldn't be as harsh, but this is not a $30 bourbon. I just can't get past the bitterness I get from it. Thankfully I only purchased 2 50ml bottles and not the 750ml."
