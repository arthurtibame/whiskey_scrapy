2.5,"The light lemony peat and powdered sugar on the nose are promising, but the barely legal ABV fails to deliver much in the way of flavor. The mouthfeel is thin and the notes of spice, black tea and wet rocks thoroughly meh. There’s a hint of grapefruit if you’re being generous. The finish is very dry with a suggestion of tangerine. The final note I scribbled for this on the night is simply ‘why?’ An experiment as ill conceived as New Coke."
4.0,"drammers club pour. Light but interesting. Has notes of Vanilla, Banana, Peach, Coconut, Caramel, Flowers, Caramel Custard, Pear, Hint of Smoke, Pepper, Honey, Wax, and Grass. Shows the fruity side of Ardbeg very well."
4.5,"Surprising tastes, not too peated, fooral"

2.5,I think ardbeg should stick to their peat Buster's.  The balance is completely off and not what you'd expect from an ardbeg
