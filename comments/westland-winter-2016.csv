3.0,"Nose - Light peat, sweet white wine poached pears, light fruity sherry, fresh cut apples, sweet cream butter.
Taste - Light campfire-like peat, light stewed apple sweet, oily mouthfeel, peppery ginger snaps, black pepper spice.
Finish - Lingering peat, like the morning after a campfire, lightly bitter apple peel sweetness.
Score - 71/100
Final Thoughts - The nose on this was was quite nice, very light campfire and fruity. That was probably the best aspect of this I think. Once you got a taste, it was a bit off balanced I thought. Instead of a nice balanced dram, I kind of got smoke-fruity-smoke in distinct stages versus a nice cohesive blend like I get in the Highland Park 12. I can see how someone who really enjoys peat might like this a bit more. It's tasty in its own right, but I definitely have to be in the mood for it."

3.25,"Getting my hands on a bottle of this was a stroke of luck. I have found that Westland hardly disappoints. 

The first most notable notes are light, fragrant scents of dried plums, pecans and fresh rain. The taste is full of spice, floral notes, juniper and slight touch of tobacco. Earthy flavors blend with light natural aromas to create a unique take on the Westland stock. Overall, pretty good, but they have done a lot better with some of their other spirits."

5.0,"A beautiful seasonal release from Westland. This dram is rich in baking spices, vanilla, and caramel. Smoke pulls you through the nose into this baked treat with a surprisingly smooth finish that leaves your senses reminiscing of a crackling fire and cold winter nights."
