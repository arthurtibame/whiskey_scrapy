5.0,"Nothing short of dazzling. Warmth, comfort, and sweetness delivered so gently. A complex sipper that shines on the chilliest of Canadian nights."

2.0,"The second of my samples from last year’s Northern Border limited editions is a disappointing contrast to the excellent Gooderham. The delicate floral notes on the nose are hard to pick out amid an excess of ethanol. The palate is soft caramel flavors but they’re quickly overwhelmed by a very spicy, almost harsh finish. I appear to be in a minority here so perhaps my sample was atypical, but more likely this one just fails to live up to the promise of its age and finish."

3.0,"A great first impression of smooth rich caramelized oak, sweet toffee and light apple acidity. It has a dry mouthfeel though and overall comes across a little thin. Maybe most closely comparable to Gibson’s Venerable. It gives the same impression, good quality yet lacking. I wouldn’t turn it down but I prefer the 10 year rum finished over this. $90 in Ontario."

4.25,"This is an excellent Canadian whisky. Lots of toffee, butter, and a bit of oak and fruit on the nose. The palate is full of baking spices, a little pepper, and lots of cooked brown sugar. It is very coating and really reminds me of buttered baking. The finish is only medium but allows more of the oak to come through. Overall it is too sweet for me but easy to sip and certainly a complex dram to spend an evening with."
3.75,"Spicy, peppery and grainy"
