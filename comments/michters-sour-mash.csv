4.0,"So freakin' yummy! This has been a long time favorite but it's been a few years since I had it last. Luckily time has not swayed my opinion of it much.

A bouquet of coconut, pineapple, caramel, and a few hot fumes. The palate is a little more toasty and very smooth. Charred wood, grilled tropical fruit, toasted coconut, and creamy vanilla.

This is the stuff you share to get people into American whiskey."

4.0,The halfway point between rye and bourbon.
3.75,"Nose (3.75):  Nice caramel, nougat, and vanilla.  reminds me of a bulls-eye candy.

Palate(3.75):  Nose continues into the palate.  This is a very well balanced sipper.  I would have liked it to be a tad more concentrated with the tastes as they start to fade a bit.  All and all though very pleasurable.

Finish: (3.75)  Quicker finish with some added oak and cinnamon.  This is a mellow bourbon and in my opinion likely has a lower rye in the mash.  If you want a little spicier wheater this is the one to pick"

3.0,It’s a pretty good whiskey. Not bad for a daily sipper.
3.75,I would love to know what exactly the mash blend is by percentage. It’s a very interesting whiskey. It’s a little more spicy than what I like in a straight sipper unless it’s a peaty scotch. It lacks the buttery caramel and toffee of a true bourbon. The rye definitely shines through. Although not a sipper for me it is hands down a damn good choice for an old fashioned.

2.75,"Not my favorite whiskey ever but not bad either.  Super simple with basically nothing complex or surprising.

Nose: Classic bourbon nose with heavy vanilla, brown sugar, orange peel, light oak, and some grassy notes.  Just a hint of poached apple in the background.

Flavor: Very young tasting with more vanilla, caramel, and a little more ethanol punch than I'd like given the low proof.  The dominant flavor is candied orange peel.  Very thin and watery.  I think this would have benefitted significantly from a higher proof as it feels like there are more complex notes hiding in the background that I can't pick out.  It has just a hint of mint, poached apple, baking spice, and barely a whisper of a cereal note.  The only thing that really bothered me is this is WAY too sweet.

Finish: Very short with some harsh bitter wood notes and more sweetness and just a tiny bit of hot spice.  Finishes with a low level ginger flavor that lingers for a bit and then disappears just leaving a saccharine coating in the mouth.

I wanted to like this more.  I didn't hate it though.  It's an easy drinker that is not complex but I feel like it would be significantly improved by some more time aging in the barrel and being bottled closer to 100 proof instead of 86.  Honestly it reminds me a little of Tennessee whiskeys I've tried in the past."

Taste - Sweet oaky caramel, cinnamon spice, light oaky sweetness, hints of cocoa & light toasted rye spice

Finish - Lingering sweet, vanilla minty caramel, malted milk balls, light cinnamon oak spice

Score - 88/100

Final Thoughts - This is a very pleasant dram, nice sweet chocolaty notes that can be easily sipped neat. Nice balance of oaky & sweet with just enough spice to keep things interesting. Good balance from start to finish, nothing off putting. Most likely best sipped neat or in a cocktail that will highlight the chocolate notes in this.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - Yes"

5.0,"Excited to review a Whiskey which Bobby Axelrod from the tv series ""BILLIONS"" always drinks. 

I believe this is the best american whiskey i have ever tasted (excluding bourbons).

Bottled at 43% with a russetmuscat color 

On the nose is nice, complex. Starts very sweet, with sugar, bananas, powdered sugar, and if you let it breath a little it will become fruity and citric, with orange and lemon peel notes. Finally it mutates to lemon pie.

On the palate is FANTASTIC. i even gave it a 27 over 25 to throw some extra points in there. Oranges, apricots, pleasant oakyness, ginger, pepper, some smoke, very thick very chewable. 

Finish is short but amazing. Like an instant ginger bomb, enjoyable. 

Overall i give this beauty a score of 97 over 100 and i recommend it."

3.0,"First time trying this one.

nose - zero aroma of alcohol in this one which may have something to do with the low proof. I get honey, vanilla, and some chocolate. All very sweet notes. Smells quite good

taste - very light on the tongue. A bit bland to me at the start but as it sets on the tongue and goes down you notice some smooth sweet flavors of chocolate and honey come to play and ends with a bit of pepper and fruitiness. 

overall and value - off and on availability in my area. Found from 40 - 50$. In my opinion, this is a good complex bourbon but doesn't drink like a $50 bottle. The nose is nice a sweet as is the taste. Not as good as some of the other bourbon's I have had from Michters, but still good."
3.75,"Buttery cinnamon and a hint of apple brighten the nose. Rye, oak, and barley hit the taste buds right before a small bite, and smooth creamy finish.  Another great offering from Michters."
3.75,"Nose is sweet and sour like an apple pie before going in the oven.  No real oak or chat on the nose.  Thin but incredibly smooth.  Fruity, slightly sour and oak on the tongue with a hint of heat and spice on the finish.  Very straightforward, very easy sipper.  At the price point this would go well vs Buffalo trace or a four roses single barrel for those who are into that sort of thing...

As time goes on I’m liking this more and more.  A lot of classic bourbon flavor with virtually zero burn.  There are sweet caramel, oak and spice notes.  Really nothing not to like about this one.  A higher proof, non-chill filtered version might show its true colors but why bother!  This is just flat out pleasant to drink neat all day long..."

A nice bourbon but on the mild side overall."
