3.75,A strong blast of rye bread. With wood notes. A bit of menthol. As the fill level goes down a sweetness emerged. Malty. A bit of sourness and tangyness Earthy. For a craft distiller and 100% rye I rated this fairly highly.
3.25,"Nose. Red wine and meat with a little bread. There’s wheat on this. Vinegar.
Taste. Light moutfeel. Mineral- like. Tastes like there’s barley in the mashbill but there isn’t. Tastes like a rye single malt. Lots of honey and fruit. Stone fruit with mild spice."
4.0,Tastes very similar to a single malt
1.0,"I find this nose to be incredibly off-putting. Soap, and thin astringent. What follows in the palate shows an underlying light and sweet spirit which might be enjoyable had it not been ruined by these sour and aggressive notes. I can't taste anything... Through the sip and for at least 5 minutes. Don't ruin your cocktails with this either, however it does a reasonable job unclogging my sink. 1 point for the buzz."
3.75,"Usually only use ryes for cocktails, but this was a pretty good sipper."
