4.25,"Beautiful dark blend, definitely has a good amount of Yamazaki in it. Well-balanced, sweet, fruity and a little bit smoky. 92"

4.0,"Nose - Very light fruity/floral vanilla, light caramel, hints of Asian pear, carambola (star fruit).

Taste - Fairly thin and light, pear/white grape juice, floral, light balanced fruity bittersweet like that of a pomelo pith, gentle woody/spice tingle.

Finish - Light lingering wood/spice tingle, fruity & floral notes remain, more Asian pear & carambola along w/ fading pomelo pith bittersweet.

Score - 81/100

Final Thoughts - This one screams Japanese blend. Flavors are very light, well put together, nothing offensive, but subtle. Fairly boring on the nose, but very floral & almost gentle purfume-like. I have a feeling this is best served neat as it seems like it would very quickly disappear in a highball or any other mixture. Very light & gentle summery feel, something you can sip on and quickly forget about. Nothing off-putting but at the same time nothing really memorable."

3.25,"I saw this Suntory Royal bottle at a friend's house and when he said ""pick any bottle"" i obviously went for the ""old looking Suntory"", thinking of course that it was the hardest one to find. The result: a not too enjoyable dram that is easily forgotten.

On the nose: Grain whisky right from the start. Lemon, dry cake, Yeast, raw rice. Very similar to haig club. 

On the palate: spice, butter and corn. Not good. Aftertaste is short with yeast notes. 

Basically a grain whisky, this one could be avoided. 68/100."

4.5,"Pleasant on the nose with a touch of woody sweetness.
The sweetness builds up to a toffee like taste when you breath out. Not without just a touch of spice to let you know how complex it actually is."
