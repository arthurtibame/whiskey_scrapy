3.0,11 dollar drink at bar. Better than most micro distillery’s. Has the rye taste with some sweetness and a little off taste that’s not bad but different.

5.0,I really like the mix of spicy and sweet. That's my type of whisky. It worth the try compare to many other large commercial product.

3.0,"Closer to 3.5 than 3 stars. Young and overpriced, as much micro distilled whiskey is, but not bad. Big rye, sweetness, a very rustic, green, grain-forward character that evokes the grain-to-glass ethos, for better or for worse. Dont buy it expecting greatness; buy it because you want to support a little guy doing good things. Has a lot of potential once the juice *actually* matures."
