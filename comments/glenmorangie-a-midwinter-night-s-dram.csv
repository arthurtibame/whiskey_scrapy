3.75,"After years as a struggling student drinking the cheapest Bell’s and Whyte & Mackay I could get at the student union, Glenmorangie was my gateway malt!  I’ve always had a real soft spot for their whiskies and, while I’m more of an Islay man these days, I still love a dram from The Sixteen Men of Tain.

This expression is a lovely NAS Christmassy winter expression.  The initial hit is warm and orangey, with apple, cinnamon and pepper as it develops.  The aftertaste is more of the same with added lemon peel and sherry that stays with you for a long while.  Overall a lovely warming dram.  I’ve nearly finished my bottle and it’s a hard one to find these days, so it’s one I’m likely to miss once it’s gone."
