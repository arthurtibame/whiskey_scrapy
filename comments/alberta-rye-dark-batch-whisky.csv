4.0,"Great whisky for the price. Add an ice cube or soften with a splash of water and the maple syrup notes open up. Nice bright finish down the throat. I really, really like this for a sweeter Rye on it's own and it also makes a delicious Manhattan."

2.75,"Perfectly passable and moderately enjoyable rye whiskey.
The fruity sherry notes are unmistakable. You can tell that this is definitely sweeter than any whiskey would normally be without this kind of addition or significant barrel finishing.

Yes, it drinks hotter than its proof (90) but not any more than 100pf.  Undercurrents of chocolate, plum, and fig.  It almost tastes like there is a touch of chocolate rye malt in the mix.

Interesting and worth $20 a bottle. I wish it were higher proof"

3.0,"I get strong Sherry notes on the nose with some maple syrup. It's difficult to get past the Sherry but with time I get the maple syrup again on the palate with vanilla and baking spices, leading towards a moderate peppery finish with baking spices and dried fruits. Pretty strong value for the price at $32 a bottle."

4.0,"I don't much like finished bourbons.  It can be nice in a lot of scotches.   But I was surprised how much I enjoyed this sherry finish in this Rye.

This is good sipping stuff."
3.5,"Dominant sherry profile.  I give high marks as a very smooth, very unique offering.  This has more in common with a sherried Scotch than most rye whiskeys, but the blend offers a very clearly complex experience, except one that ends up rich, zesty, smooth, and sweet, all in a complimentary and enjoyable balance.  Often ""complex"" whiskies just feel muddled, clashing, or without purpose beyond taking a ""man's"" palate to appreciate.  perhaps benefitting from the freedom of blending, this feels purposeful and well-crafted.  It is quite different, but do yourself a favor and see if it's to your liking."

1.0,This might possibly be the worst rye ever made. The nose is so terribly astringent that your pretty sure you must be ready to drink nail polish. It does not taste as bad as it smells but still that is hard to get past. I have a lot of whisky and this was recommended by a local store employee. I now realize I will never ever take his advice on anything again.

5.0,"Dark and syrupy with crazy rum like legs
Nose - smells like a Manhattan
Taste, so Manhattany you'll be trying to pick a cherry out of it.
Finish is smooth and sweet
I recommend to serve this chilled"
3.0,"The makeup of the bottle alone makes it worth sampling - a blend of two different ryes make up 91% of the content, with some bourbon and actual added sherry. Not just sherry finishing in a cask - actual sherry. It's also bottled at 45% abv, which might help explain why this seems notably more rich and full than the average Canadian bottling. And, it IS rich and lush, with appropriately dark notes given the name of dried fruit and nutty grains. I'm reminded of whole grain flapjacks topped with a pat of butter and dried dark fruit simmered in maple syrup. Or maybe I'm just jonesing for some breakfast food - we report, you decide. Regardless, the sherry influence alongside the spicy-smooth, nutty rye base, with that hint of maple, is pleasant...until the rather bitter finish, which takes the edge off of an otherwise enjoyable whisky."
4.0,"Very well balance, not harsh"
4.0,"Amber to maple syrup in color. Spicy leather, woody, concord grapes, and  molasses on the nose.. Spicy, earthy, leather with a bourbon whiskey and sweet sherry wash on the finish. Has some heat but it adds to the feel of this nice Rye whiskey."

1.0,"To the point:  This stuff tastes like someone mixed a cheap bottom-shelf plastic jug whisky with grape kool-aide mix.  I can't find anything good to say about it.  I don't know what I'm going to do with it.  I'd dump it down the drain, but I don't think my septic tank deserves the pain."

1.0,"We all stereotype.  Yes, it's human.   After my last few Canadians (Crown Royal Northern Harvest and Crown Royal Noble Collection), I was led to believe all Canadian whiskey is affordable and very good.  Stereotyping.  It's like assuming just because  macaroons, mousse, and cassoulet are good French dishes, all French cuisine must be good.  Till you run into the Ortolan (Google it...horrifying ).   This here is pretty bad.  First of all, let's talk about how it's made.  It's about 90% of 50/50 rye from a pot still and column still.  The other 8-9%  or so is from bourbon. And the remaining 1% from Sherry.  Not Sherry cask, but actual Sherry. As in the wine itself.  I can imagine the Nazi like Scotch whisky association screaming blasphemy.  So what does it taste like?  Like when a bunch of frat boys decide to mix their leftover liquor to create the next evening special.  I had this at a local tasting, where the guy was selling me on the point that it's one of the few whiskies under $30.  The kicker was that he had this tasting along with Crown Royal Northern.   Sort of like good Canadian and bad Canadian.  The only positive is the color.  Really nice mahogany dark tea like color.   They might as well have injected 0.5% squid ink for the color.  Just  for kicks."

3.0,"In the Glass: Dark amber, maple syrup.

On the Nose: Sweet, bourbon notes are the first to hit the nose.  Vanilla, rye and then the sherry with some faint baking spices.  With the sherry in there, it almost has a dark rum quality to it.
Neat, there's some heat on the end from the 45% ABV.  
With water, the heat on the nose disappears.  This is likely a younger blend, and at the higher strength it can certainly take a few drops.  The nose gets sweeter and the baking spices come more to the forefront.  Burnt sugar,  and some caramel.  The water tames the rye and amps up the bourbon influence.  


Taste: Sweet, hot, spice.  You get the bourbon and the rye immediately on the arrival, with the heat of the alcohol through the development.  The finish is all about the sherry.  It almost seems like cheating to simply add sherry instead of finishing the whiskey in a sherry cask, but it's also kind of genius too.  The sherry is only 1% of the total blend, and that seems like just the right amount.
With water, this becomes a lot more fruit-forward on the arrival with the development and the finish showing off the rye.  Sweet and spice.  The alcohol still plays a role here, but it's pretty well integrated for a younger blend.  This is like the Canadian cousin to some black, spiced rums that I can think of."

3.0,Oaky nose. Very nice spice with a light vanilla. I expected to have more a distinct rye flavor.
4.0,"Nose - Definitely a heavy sherry influence here even though it's only 1% of the whisky, dark pitted fruits, vanilla caramels and milk chocolate are in the background. Sweet spiced plums stewed in a red wine.
Taste - Sweet dark cherries, luxardo maraschino cherry syrup, rye bread, cinnamon, dark chocolate covered cherries, wild cherry pepsi concentrate.
Finish - Lingering bitter walnut sweetness, more luxardo cherry syrup, a drying dark chocolate bittersweet.
