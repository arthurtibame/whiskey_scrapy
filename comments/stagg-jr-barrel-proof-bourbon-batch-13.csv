4.75,"Better than batch 12. Less ethanol, fantastic nose, easy sipper. Vanilla extract bomb! Think Eagle Rare cask strength."
4.5,"Neat. Nose of cherry caramel oak. Taste is sweet oaky cherry caramel with a long dry oaky cherry caramel finish. I think it’s great. While head to head I prefer 12 over this 13 batch in a blind tasting, it’s splitting hairs. I’m a big GTS and Jr fan and glad I found a bottle of this."

4.75,"Delicious, might be better than 2019 GTS.  After opening up for a little over a week this bottle has smoothed out so much.  Might buy a couple more of these to stock up.  Wish I could have found the batch #12 to compare"

4.5,"Nose is fairly fruit with raisins and red apple, as well as chocolate, barrel char, oak, and holiday baking spices and yeast rolls. Very pleasant nose.

The palate has a thicker mouthfeel with the tongue feeling dry while the bourbon is sitting on it. There are baking and rye spices, leather, raisins, caramel and oak.

The finish begins spicy with a little burn as it goes down slowly. Then follows through with lingering oaky and fruit notes on the mid palate for an overall long finish.

I enjoy this one a lot. A little more fruit than batch 12. In fact, I think I like this one more. I also get less ethanol on batch 13. Though I’m comparing this new batch 13 to a third empty batch 12 that has been open a few months."

4.25,"Light amber color. Nose has vanilla cream, dark cherries, cinnamon graham crackers and a touch of oak. Rich, oily mouthfeel. Palate is hot with notes of cinnamon sugar, cherry cola, and oak.  
Finish is long, hot, and dry with brown sugar, cinnamon and oak. Excellent, but not quite as good as batch 12."

4.75,"So I must say I had zero intentions on doing a separate review of Batch 13 when I had already reviewed the now infamous Batch 12. (See that review for full tasting notes) “Pffft. The difference between the two is probably imperceptible!” I said.

After tasting them on back to back nights, well, what can I say...I was wrong. Bourbon community, you really know your stuff on this one; Batch 12 is the bomb. But what of Batch 13?

Batch 13, while still very much Stagg Jr, is fruiter, spicer, and with WAY more barrel char and way less brown sugar/molasses. Is it still delicious? You bet. Still worth the money? Most definitely. Am I buying Batch 14? The moment I can get my hands on it."

Batch 13 - 128.4 proof

Nose:  vanilla, sweet with baking spice

Palate: rich, oily with good mouth feel with vanilla, cinnamon, and baking spice

Finish: LONG, full, rich with vanilla and baking spice 

I have tried both batch 12 & 13 and I prefer 13, because it is richer with more vanilla"

4.75,"Fantastic. A true powerhouse. All kinds of baking spices, dark, deep flavors (caramel, butterscotch, vanilla, oaky nuttiness). If you want a FULL flavor profile, this is it."
4.5,null
4.25,"Batch 13,128.4 proof. This is a full flavor, punch you in the face bourbon. Dark chocolate, brown sugar sweetness with tons of oak and cherry. High proof makes the tongue tingle, and almost a spicy rye shining through as well. A few drops of water smooth everything out and leads to rich, creamy vanilla. Wow this batch is amazing, and at $50, one of the best value bourbons I've ever had."

4.25,"Nose is cinnamon and cool mint. Palate is quick to more cinnamon but with black black pepper, but fades quickly. It does leave a lingering heat in the chest. Add ice and let it sit a minute. Doughy cherry pie and a slight licorice come forward improving the experience greatly. After letting the bottle sit a few months and coming back to it, same general description but I like it more. It should also be noted that the photo on the review page is not of Batch 13. The 128.4 proof listed on the review page is correct."
3.5,"First dram of stagg jr. pretty stoked. 
Just had some curry and tried to wash out the taste with water...
M

Nose: Not as potent as I expected on the nose with the proof it sits at. Sweet spicy pickles is my initial whiff. Grains. Sweet mustard. Raisins. Hard to pick anything else out possibly because the food I ate.

Taste: peppery sweetness with lots of heat. Leathery. Lots of alcohol on the tongue. 

Finish: tons of heat in all areas of the mouth, it pools up in the back of the throat, minute in and I’m still feeling tons of heat in the back of the throat."

5.0,"Wow! This is one spicy meatball!

Heavy cherry, oak, tobacco, caramel and cinnamon on the nose. The finish is a little spicy but, in a good way. I would make this my daily drinker if it was easier to get. Favorite bottle so far this year."
4.5,"A very Spicy boy that’s finish is complex with lots of barrel character. Straight is pretty hot, a few drops of water really changes the nose. Strongly recommend bribing your local brown dealer to stash one away for you when they get one."

4.0,Cinnamon and Cherries.   Much better than any batch I tried before.   (Have not tried 12 yet)
4.75,"Amazing whiskey with a rich sweet and sour profile. If you ever see a bottle in the shelves then grab it immediately. 

Nose - sour cherries, red apple and vanilla, some bittersweet chocolate and a bit of brown sugar, and some dried fruit along with the other more prominent notes
Taste - sweet and fruity at first, almost floral and herbal on the tongue, and dark chocolate with dried cherries, a hint of sweet caramel or burned brown sugar
Finish - sour and sweet notes mix together pleasantly, and nice sharp burn that fades into the background, an oily and lingering finish"

4.75,"Man, this stuff is good! Just did a side by side comparison with this and batch 12. I gotta say that this one just edges out the other batch. More of the traditional bourbon flavors like oak and vanilla come through on this batch and it has a slightly thicker mouthfeel. The palate on this batch is also a little bit drier but both are amazing with long finishes. Great pour!!"

2.75,"Nose - chocolate, tobacco, cinnamon, alcohol, and oak. There's a masterful dusty oaky rich aromatic notes. Sweet oak. 

Taste - oak chocolate. Maybe a walnut? Rich vanilla. This is buffalo trace's oak with their chocolate cherry notes, but low on the cherry and more the oak.  This is their show case stuff. 

That said the nose is kinda meh.....the flavor is pretty wow. I'm doing a 2.75 and that's huge knock on the nose. Also the flavor is too alcoholic."

4.5,As close to perfect as you can get! Easy drinking high proof bourbon.  Winning!!!!
5.0,Sweet full burn. Oaky finish. Lip numbing goodness
4.5,"Nose is very classic bourbon and a perfect Buffalo Trace signature. Green apples, dried apricot and banana, dark fruits, cherries, caramel and maple syrup. 

On the palate, the initial heat gives way to complex and round mouthfeel. I get the cherries and the fruits I’m used to with Eagle Rare. Heat lasts for a medium finish. 

It’s like Buffalo Trace and Eagle Rare has a baby and turned the heat up to 11. 

I use the rating scale below. Distiller uses a scale of 5 and I use a scale of 10, but I’m sure you’re not too drunk to do the math! 

1. Disgusting - So bad I poured it out.
2. Poor - I wouldn't consume by choice.
3. Bad - Multiple flaws.
4. Below average - Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.
5. Good - Just average.
6. Very Good - Better than average.
7. Great - Well above average.
8. Excellent - In a league of its own.
9. Incredible - An all-time favorite.
10. Perfect"

4.0,"Re-visiting this one after 2 months. 

Initial whiff is banana cream, vanilla, custard, citrus zest.

Taste- heat from the get go, this thing wants to own your soul. Cinnamon, thick honey, tangy, spices, candied fruits, oak for days."
3.5,"The nose is vanilla, caramel, chocolate, oak and cherry - Bourbon Disneyland jr.  (Sorry Florida.)  Right away, I realize the 64.2% ABV isn't detected on the nose.  I exhale through my nostrils into the glass, but there is no major stinging of the eyes from the blowback.  

Down the hatch: sour cherry with pepper upfront, followed by big oak and warm caramels.  My palate is so blown away, I don't remember much of the finish.  Second sip is orange and vanilla, with a zing of cinnamon.  The mouthfeel remains viscous and oily: drying as I chew.  The ABV hits me in the face this time like a bat boy trying to impress a female rookie cop.  That's when I head back to the kitchen to add a couple of drops of water.  The third sip is sour [again!], oak, and chocolate.  Although adding water produces a bone dry finish (and render the legs runny), by the same token, it's far from useless:  orange oil and some kind of dark spice - like cloves or star anise - blooms, without coming across as synthetic, or unnatural.  That's unique!  But the tongue is on fire.  

This is a fighting man's whiskey, to be sure, but the man here is not exactly fighting the burn.  This is a whiskey that I won't be drinking for pleasure or self-indulgence.  Drinking this is for those times when you feel like you're Jacob wrestling with God's angel - times when you're locking horns with the other f***er.  It's galvanizing, without being seductive, and clarifying without being illuminating.

4.25,"Nose: red hots is the predominant smell.  Oak.  Faint alcohol smell which is expected for something around 130 proof. 

Palate: Heat!  Lot of spices, but hard to pick out a predominant one.  Definitely can taste the oak char.  Mouthfeel is thinner than I would have thought.  

Finish:  More heat!  Burns all the way down, but in a good way that only a bourbon drinker could appreciate.  This isn’t some fancy craft bourbon - this is the real deal and will put hair on your chest.   Overall, I really like it, but it will me saved for those really tough days that need a very stiff drink to get over."
