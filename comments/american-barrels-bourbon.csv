PS: my kid went to IU too - so I thought I'd toss a little support your way"
3.0,Had this neat at the BB&T Center. Had a strange wintergreen aroma. Flavor is decent though. I would rate a 3.5 if I could have.

4.0,This a good young but tasty bourbon. I have yet to find a bottle but did go to a tasting and it made a good lasting impression. Look forward to making it a regular in the home bar.

2.0,"Ok, first off - this bottle is badass. Love it, the snake, the shell on bottom and the neck.  Now, let’s get to the taste...it’s harsh.  The first sip is intense and really doesn’t lessen up as you drink.  Get it for the bottle, don’t get it for the bourbon."

3.0,Not a huge fan. Heavy on rye. Earthy nose and pallet. Sweet molasses nose. Delayed heat.

1.5,"Sad to say, the most interesting and entertaining part of this bourbon is the bottle. Lets just call this one spicy water. I've yet to do it, but it may make for a decent quick Old Fashioned."
1.5,Smell Test Failed. Wasn’t pleasing to the pallet. It’s a rough whiskey. Maybe in some coke a cola it will drown it’s Taste
1.0,"Aroma - mainly alcohol burn
Flavor - not much discernable taste, not sweet, not spicy.  Almost like drinking bourbon flavored vodka
Drinkability - wouldn't reach for this again, all that is memorable is the alcohol burn at the end"

1.0,"Visually, the bottle is amazing, the Gadsden rattler wrapped around an oversized shotgun shell is eye catching and I will admit that I bought it because of the bottle. The bourbon itself is meh at best. The color is more yellow than amber. The nose is okay, with a slightly woody smell. I was extremely disappointed in the taste. The tongue primarily picked up corn with some slight caramel and a big alcohol punch in the end. It was more like drinking a flavored moonshine than a bourbon. I am not a fan of technologically aged bourbon, and this one did not change my mind.  I will drink it, and then use the bottle to hold better tasting bourbon in a less attractive bottle."
0.5,"The nose of the whiskey smells of sweet corn mash extremely reminiscent of a white dog.  It starts with corn, and quickly transitions into the scent of flour and is then overpowered by alcohol.  It is not pleasant.

On the palate there is a young woody flavor.  The vanilla one might expect from a bourbon is not present.  The flavor is also very grain forward.  Again, the alcohol overpowers the rest of the profile.

Aged too long to be a white dog, and not long enough to be a bourbon."

1.5,"Very complex.  Vanilla, caramel and very woody but has a very strong alcohol bite to it.  A heavy aftertaste of grain alcohol is left instead of the flavors a bourbon should have."
