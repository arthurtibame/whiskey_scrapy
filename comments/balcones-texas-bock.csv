4.25,"I'm a huge fan of all things Balcones. They have their own shelf pretty high on my bar. That being said, I'm biased in their favor. 

The nose reminds me of Hudson's maple barrel with some banana nut bread just below the surface. The overall color is a very deep gold and matches the Shiner label perfectly. 

The mash bill is the same from the Shiner beer, but the malt kicks in just as strong as the Balcones peated products. The palette is lighter than expected with a finish more on the short end compared to, say the Brimstone or even True Blue 100. 

Needless to say, this is a very interesting product on its own and I can't wait to see if this beer mash collaboration keeps going. It's like Eden & Oak with more soul than spiral wood inserts."
4.5,As a fan of Shiner beer I’m already biased but I’m getting a lot of sweet maple on the nose and a malty sour flavor on the pallet. I love this whiskey.

4.0,"Tastes like Balcones. That’s for sure. Definite sweet and malty notes that remind me of Shiner. I wouldn’t give it any awards, but if the goal was to make a decent whiskey out of Shiner? Mission accomplished"
4.0,"Not a malt fan, but this is damn tasty! Lots of maple syrup on the nose and lots of barley on the palate. The finish is definitely got lingering tastes of Shiner Bock. Lots of parallels to Brimstone and even some subtle hints of True Blue.  

Overall, super delicious. Very impressed."
4.25,"I like Balcones. I like Shiner Bock. I drink plenty of both...
With that out of the way, I was very excited by this collaboration. 

Balcones took the Shiner mashbill (minus the hops), fermented it with Shiner’s proprietary yeast, distilled it, and aged it in new oak for at least 2 years. It’s a straight malt whiskey. Aside from the roasted barley malt, I don’t know what else is in the mashbill.

On the nose, there’s a deep, earthiness to this whiskey. It’s smells similar to their single malt Mirador with some extra heartiness like their Pot Still Bourbon. You definitely get that roasted barely note on the nose. I get some dark dried fruits like raisins and a bit of spice. Reminds me of toasted raisin bread. I love it.

The taste has all-spice, some maple syrup sweetness, and more of that roasted barley. There’s some barrel char on the finish along with some heat. 30 minutes later... ok I’m still getting some maple syrup on the taste. How interesting...

Overall: Although it’s the Shiner Bock mashbill, you can definitely tell that it’s a Balcones product. Give it a shot and grab yourself a bottle soon before it’s all gone.... Cheers!"

3.75,I am not a fan of rating whiskies on a number scale. I judge them on if it was a good buy and then if I would buy it again. This one is worth buying once at least. It is hard to say if I get a resemblance of Shiner in it but I can tell that it is different because of it.  Not a great Balcones example but if you like Balcones this is a fun one one to have something different. I think this one deserves a higher rating...if I was into that sort of thing.

3.5,"Balcones is one of my favorites. 

The color is beautifully dark amber. 

The nose is cherry, some charcoal, and licorice. 

Taste is joyful.  It is for sure Balcones. The cherry is there along with some light coffee. 

It has some slight burn following that holds you for a while. 

I love Balcones and Texas."

5.0,"Excellent collaboration between Balcones and Shiner. Malty, syrupy goodness."
4.25,Sweet with some smokiness a little oak and a bite at the end. There has to be better whiskeys out there so I didn’t give it a 5 but it’s one of the best I’ve ever had.
