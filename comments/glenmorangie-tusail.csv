맛 : 부드러움, 실키실키

3.25,"노즈: 꽃 꿀 매우 단 향, 비누향?, 레몬껍질을 살짝 나무에 문댄듯한 향
팔레트: 상큼, 단맛이 지나가고 우디스파이스가 올라옴, 과일 상큼함
피니쉬: 몰트 단맛, 우드, 견과류 껍질의 떫음
글렌파클라스?"
4.0,"Lemon and peaches on the nose.  Light grass and grain.  Light citrus lemon/lime on the tongue.  Barley with a touch of sweetness(honey?)  Slight sour, yeasty finish.  Malty but earthier.  A bit of wood spice.

This is a bit of an oddity, but definitely worth a try.  The classic Glenmorangie is in there, but it's subdued behind the more unusual flavors."

3.0,"2 bagged this with the 18yo. I like this but to be fair the 18 feels better and is cheaper, so buy that one instead and be happy."
3.0,"Nose: Honey with a hint of wine.
Taste: Salt and honey, then a kick of ginger, that fades into that good olde toffee."

4.0,"The thing I hate the most about NAS bottles is when you're trying not to like them on principle, but they keep on being so fucking good. This ended up being the standout at a tasting I went to. Creaminess that's reminiscent of Glenfarclas 12, but more on the side of lemon meringue rather than custard. The finish is a lingering smooth agrume with a hint of spice that delights, and begs for more. Bit on the expensive side, but cheap compared to, say, a cocaine habit, so stop judging me, Dad."

4.0,"This may be a NAS, but this private edition offering is damn good. No coloring and not chill filtered, and a nice 46% ABV. The nose is full of banana, white grapes, marzipan, icing, and powdered sugar. The palate is a great mix of apple pie a la mode, corn flakes and a banana split. A long finish of nutmeg with a touch of cinnamon and ginger snaps. Wow, I am very glad I took a gamble on the bottle. If you like sweet drams like I do, go for it. This is a 4.25 for me. The theme to this dram is going to be  ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" by GNR."
