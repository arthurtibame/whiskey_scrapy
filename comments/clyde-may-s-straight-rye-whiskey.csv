3.75,"Smells of spice, some cinnamon and sweetness. Starts off with sweeter notes and then a warm spice enters. Finishes dry with an a hint of straw. Good spice, and not too harsh. Quite good."

4.25,"First impressions are sometimes complex. At first, I got lavender and honey, with charred berry notes on the nose.  With my first sip, that exploded into tons of floral and grains, and a wheaty sensation as it goes down. No real burn here, but a surprisingly warm follow up as it slides from my throat to my stomach. A very unique, but delicious take on ryes!"

3.5,"Wonderful nose, lots of honey and fruit. The palate is pleasant, with clove honey, orchard fruit, a definite but not overpowering floral rye note, cinnamon, cacao nibs. Smooth for the proof but the warmth is there. Nice sipper. 3/24/19"
