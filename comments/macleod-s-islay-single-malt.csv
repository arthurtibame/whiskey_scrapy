3.25,"Peaty and good start, but a little disappointed with the ending. After Laphroaig wanted to try another Islay Whisky, but ended up just wishing it was Laphroaig."

Doften liknar laphroig.
Rund och snäll efter en stund i munnen."

4.0,"Nice Islay whiskey.  Smooth.   Definitely going to keep this around.  Great Islay taste at a hell of a price.  Check it.  Won’t change your life, but a very good whiskey and good value."

3.25,"Checks all of the boxes I look for in an Islay at a fraction of the price. Lots of great peaty, smoky flavor with a smooth finish. Like another review said, nothing exceptional but for the price I’d have a hard time finding a competitor."
