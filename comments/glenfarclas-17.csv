4.0,"Butterscotch, orange peel, sherry, dark cherries, and fresh tobacco on the nose. (This is much more of an 'herbal' whisky than Distiller's flavor profile suggests.) The orange becomes more prevalent on the palate, and an assertive oak note lingers into the medium-to-long finish. A well-crafted balancing of first-, second-, and third-fill ex-sherry casks."

Wonderful stuff."

Personally I like the Glenfarclas 15 more. Its cheaper and the taste and smell is stronger, not as complex but the sherry and fruits punch is there~

4.0,"Glenfarclas is one of the few remaining independently owned Scotch distilleries, and has a reputation for bold, sherried whiskies.  This puts it squarely into competition with the big boys at Macallan and Aberlour, and other excellent Speyside distilleries such as GlenDronach.  The 17-year old expression is arguably Glenfarclas's flagship, and it is an excellent scotch, albeit one that is, surprisingly, not a sherry bomb.  This whisky's foundation is balance.  In its aromas, there is a harmonious mix of red velvet cake, honey, mild sherry, and strawberry frosting.  In its tastes, this sweet and easy-drinking whisky features sherry, more orange and citrus fruits than the nose, cake again, a little smokiness, honey, and vanilla.  The finish integrates spice, wood, and sweet, milk chocolate for a calming conclusion.  In its mildness and balance, Glenfarclas shares more in common with Aberlour than with other Speyside distilleries, and is a worthwhile alternative to its more famous brethren."

5.0,"**Price:** $99.99 at Total Wine in Houston, Texas
  
  **Setting:** Neat in a Glencairn, with a fat basset hound in my lap.
  
  **Color:** Straw
  
  **Nose:** Stewed apples and figs. Nice but somewhat muted.
  
  **Taste:** Delicious. Dried fruit, honey, caramel, orange peel and cinnamon. I could drink this all day.
  
  **Finish:** Medium-long. Sweet and oaky. Really pleasant.
  
  **Conclusion:** Glenfarclas 17 is delicious and well-balanced. The taste and finish are both solid, and it is a very easy drinker. It’s a really nice dram, although it is somewhat pricey, and as such, it doesn’t have great QPR. Probably my favorite Speyside iteration.

Taste - Vanilla, caramel, orange zest, ginger heat, white pepper tingle, light unripe strawberries, apple/pear, light bitter almond skins.

Finish - Lingering orangy sweet, almond skin bitterness, lingering ginger/white pepper tingle.

Score - 79/100

Final Thoughts - Tasty, but it has this weird tannic bitterness about it. This noses like it was aged in a lighter sherry, like an Amontillado or a Fino barrel as it didn't have the viscous raisiny notes I get from darker sherries. Tastes a bit hot for 43% but not overwhelmingly so. It's drinkable for sure, but I guess not as sherry forward as I expected.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

4.0,"I've decided that the Glenfarclas family of single malts is rather like my wife's family. You can line her grandmother, mother, sister, and our daughter up and easily see how the younger ones will change with age. This distillery has such a well-defined house style - pronounced sherry influence, but not sherry bombs, marked by nuttiness, dried fruit, and brown sugar notes with the slightest hint of wood smoke somewhere in the background. This, in the middle of the family by age, is more nuanced and smoothed around the edges than, say, the 12 Year, but hasn't quite made it to the complexity and well-aged integration of the 21+ Year expressions. I also find here a bit more citrus than I recall from other bottlings. A very enjoyable dram indeed on a cool fall evening!"

Palate: The bourbon influence is much more apparent in the taste with vanilla and spices. Very well balanced, giving way to the sweeter Oloroso flavors and an oily feel from the buttery notes. Fruit continue to appear, but peels, orange rinds. Adding water brings out an intense baked red apple coated in cinnamon with that charred oak appearing even more.

Finish: Long lasting with spices and oak with slight smoke in the finish."

4.0,"Wow, I’m quite impressed! The nose on this is decadent, and a nice rich mouthfeel without being too sweet. Warmed dark fruit and cloves. This has incredible balance"
1.75,"My score was 1 star for the 25...is the 17 any better?  

Nose - light berry, vanilla, oak.  There's a bit of a nutty character here.  

Taste - vanilla, cream, oak, warming alcohol (43% so that's nice), and a touch of fruit.  I can see this as lightly butter scotchy, where those nutty notes in the nose are coming from perhaps.  

So I'm a bit torn.  I came into this brand expecting sherry whisky.  This isn't that.  It's much more a bourbon barrel, a very well worn bourbon barrel.  There might be some sherry casks in here but if the are, they're USED.  i like the fruity and perhaps white chocolate notes.  It's nice and yeah I like the 17 more than the 25 I think.  

The 17 is more bourbon cask notes while the 25 is more sherry with berry and fruit notes coming out a bit more.  The 17 is more nutty and butter scotch.  The 17 is more unique an experience and for me that's a win.  It's just more interesting.  The 25 is just a bad example of sherry whisky.  

So scoring this a 1.75.  It's not great.  It's 100+ bucks.  I don't recommend it."

4.25,"Glenfarclas tasting night at The Oak Barrel, Sydney, 4 July 2019. Whisky #3

Nose: A bouquet of rich, sweet aromas – brown sugar, musky cherries, raisins, candied orange peel, sherry and light buttery caramel. There are also darker notes of dried fruit and nuts that prevent the nose from seeming overly perfumed, despite a quite hefty vanilla fragrance. It’s an alluring nose that treads a fine line between being voluptuous and overblown. There is a faint smoky note on the dry glass but it’s not peat-reek.

Palate: Sweet malt and spice arrival that gives way to a development redolent of red berries and stewed fruits, roasted chestnuts, milk chocolate and aromatic baking spices (cinnamon, nutmeg and caraway). The texture is warm, rounded and supple with a satisfying creaminess. There is also a striking marzipan presence, the nuttiness of which is balanced by a mature but sprightly oak note that gives structure and dignity to what would otherwise be an over-sweet palate.

Finish: Medium/long. Soothing chocolate malted milk and a sweet earthy aftertaste with a hint of tannin.

The 17 year old has some foundation similarities to the 15, the texture being similarly chewy and mouth-coating, however this is an altogether softer and more fragrant dram. It recalls some facets of the 12 year old, which is also quite fragrant, but the nose here is richer and heavier – in comparison the nose of the 12 year old can seem just a little candyish.

This expression was originally introduced in Japan in a bid to combat grey-market imports of 15 year old Glenfarclas. It proved to be extremely popular and was later distributed more widely, becoming part of the core range for most markets.

“Very Good” : 4.25 stars"
4.5,"Nose: very heady, rich, you can smell the distinct fruits and esters, no spiciness

3.75,"info: un embouteillage 43% non filtré à froid. Une couleur or sans couleur ajouté. Une très légère fumé de 1 à 3 ppm. Une maturation en sherry casks de 1er, 2e et multi remplissage ayant contenu du xérès d'Oloroso et du Fino d'espagne. L'Oloroso est une variété de vin fortifié élaboré à Jerez et à Montilla-Moriles qui amène souvent des arôme de noix au whisky et une teinte plus foncé. Le Fino amène souvent un côté sucré et fruité.  Ce 17 ans est une édition pour l'amérique du nord, le japon et les duty free. Deux prix à son actif: Gold par Liquid Gold Award 2018 (Jim Murray's Whisky Bible) et Bronze par Prenium 2013 (Malt Maniacs awards). Un prix ici d'environ 120$ CAD et disponible à la SAQ. 

Nez: Il prend du temps à s'ouvrir. Laissez le tranquille un bon 20 minutes surtout si la bouteille est fraichement ouverte. Ok maintenant j'ai les fruits confits et le xérès au premier plan. Quelque chose de cremeux, vanille et sur la noisette. Touche de fumé. 

Bouche: Bon ok c'est sur les mêmes notes. Les fruits confits, le beurre de noisette et une touche de fumé. J'allais dire qu'il était doux mais finalement il laisse un picotement sur la langue. Un peu sharp pour un 17 ans. Bizarre, j'ai cette sensation de dilution 

Finale: longue grâce à cette touche de fumé et on fini par revoir les épices de sherry typique de la distillerie (cannelle). Une touche d'agrume aussi. Style zeste de citron.

Overall: Rien de super original et surtout si l'on connait la distillerie. Toutes les éditions sont sur ce raisin ou ces fruits confits, cette épice et ces noix. Pas de surprise. Cela dit, il s'agit d'un produit agréable à boire et suffisamment complexe pour justifier son prix. En fait, si ce produit n'était pas aussi dilué on pourrait avoir une belle expression selon moi. Je reste sur ma faim de sherry et pour être honnête je préfère le 15 qui représente selon moi un meilleur rapport qualité prix. Pour celui la: 77%"

3.75,"Visual
This whisky has a beautifully rich chestnut color. Medium to large sized tears slowly work their way down the inside of the glass. 

Nose
Malty, but with some slightly tropical notes like unripened pineapple.  There is also some green apple, and a sweetness that I just can’t place.

Palate
The first thing I noticed was that there is a very pleasant creaminess to this one.  It’s light on the front with a little sherry sweetness, but is followed up with some peppery spice toward the end.

Finish
While the finish was shorter than I expected, I wouldn’t say that it was disappointing by any means.  A little bit of heat lingers along with the sweetness of the sherry.  There is also a faint citrusy note of orange peel that presents itself from time to time.


My Rating Scale:
5 - Outstanding - Hide this bottle when guests come over. 
4.5 - Amazing - Must always have a bottle on hand.
4 - Great - Would gift to close friends.
3.5 - Very Good - Recommend without reservation.

4.5,"Nose:  Orange craisin scones with light icing.  Things turn a bit darker with brown-sugared oatmeal with loads and loads of raisins and dates.  I've never found a whiskey with such a prevalent scent of dried fruits and berries - specifically the ""dried"" aspect.  There's that stale, almost mineral-like scent that shows up when dried berries sit for a while.  More earthy notes show up as it sits, something like sweet, mulchy wood.

Palate: Sweet and refreshing! Just like the nose, it's all oatmeal and cranberries.  Up front it's slightly tart/bright cranberry, but as it sits it turns to that sweet/earthy note of dates and raisins.  Man, I love that butterscotch that shows up now - I made these cranberry, butterscotch, cinnamon, oatmeal cookies a few years back and this is the exact same thing... I might need to make those again.

Finish:  That lasts and lasts... It doesn't change much from the craisin oatmeal breakfast, though a bit of orange shows up again after a while.  That butterscotch hangs around for quite a while and then is joined by a sweet smokey note that is hard to pin down.

Conclusion:  Cranberries.  Oatmeal.  Butterscotch.  I'm a huge fan of all three and I'm loving this.  I'll definitely pick this up whenever I find it at a good price!"
