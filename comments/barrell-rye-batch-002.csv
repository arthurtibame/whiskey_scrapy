5.0,Love this rye. I’ll be honest when I first opened it I didn’t—too salty. But after a week it opened up and was Thomas Handy level of complexity. So good!
3.0,"Very interesting. Strong malty notes both on the nose and palate, not sure why. It's spicy, sweet, and earthy. The flavors are strong. May not be everyone's cup of tea, as it's unique, but I think those who like it will really like it. Compared to 001, it's more of a particular profile/occasion whiskey. I could drink 001 any time and recommend it any day, but this I'd be more measured about. Still fits Barrell's MO of swinging for the fences, love what they're doing. 1/20/18"

4.0,Cola cola cola on the taste. The nose is wonderful and probably got me a little too excited after a 100 proof knob creek 12... milk chocolate and Cabernet
4.0,"Spicy all the way around. lil beaut in the nose, mostly spiced but sweet backend. Thicc viscosity. Mouthfeel is excellent, sweet cola with a nutmeg kick. Very good rye all around"
3.75,well rounded nice rye 👍
4.0,"Nose: lot more sweet vanilla than expected, soft spice, baking spice
Taste: powerful big rye but smooth, some fruits and cherries, looooong finish
Very nice for a rye guy"
4.0,At near 70proof this is quite hot but the warmth was not displeasing. And beautiful flavor notes come through even at this hi of proof
4.0,"Pretty spicy, but it goes down easy enough at this proof that it doesn’t require any ice cubes"
