Dusty nose, with corn, candy, and a little molasses. Not much else. I don't know if it's a matter of the charcoal filtering or what, but it's simply missing a lot of what I crave in Bourbon."

Sampled in Glencairn:
Nose: Green Banana, Oak, Vanilla, Caramel, Tropical Fruits (Pineapple/Mango). A slight mustiness and some oak. After some time in the glass it picks up an odd vegetal note. Canned green beans??
Neat: So sweet. Marshmallow, Banana, Coconut, Juicy Fruit Gum. Very Desert like. Finishes with a little jolt of heat. Coats the palate with slight spice, lingering oak char, and banana pudding. 
Verdict: So much better than standard Jack, but at just over twice the cost it should be."

3.25,"Was surprised by this one. Reminded me more of extra oaked bourbon than regular Jack Daniels. Somewhat syrupy mouthfeel initially, followed by oak with hints of vanilla. Relatively little sweetness compared to Old No. 7."

3.75,"I once bought this as a gift for a friend who almost exclusively drinks the Old No. 7. When he gave me some, I remember thinking it was pretty good, much to my surprise. I'm not a fan of the Old No. 7, but based on my past experience I do have some expectations for this one.

Nose: Musty and oaky. Heavy leather, tobacco, and cocoa. Some standard bourbon notes lie caramel, vanilla, brown sugar, baking spices. A hint of classic JD banana floats somewhere in the background. A little cherry somewhere in there.  Good start.

I'm guessing this is a high-corn mash based on the lack of rye characteristics; interestingly though, it's not all that sweet.

Palate: Chewy caramel and vanilla sweetness. Instead of the past-ripe overly sweet banana I get with the old No. 7, this one presents more like a banana bread. Great note. Cherry, honey, brown sugar, walnut, leather, and cocoa round off the palate. Good stuff.

Finish: Long, and it comes in two waves. The first is all banana, vanilla, and a creamy sweetness. After this subsides, there's a kick of cinnamon and black pepper to remind that at 47%, this is not your run of the mill Old No. 7.

All things considered, I think a 3.75 is fair. Maybe a bit generous. I'd like to point out this is a prime example of why the glencairn is the best way to drink whiskey. Maybe it was just an off day, but I tried this two nights ago in a rocks glass. The nose was a mess, and everything else was mediocre at best. Yet, tonight, in a glencairn, everything just seemed to come together.

At $48, I think this is a respectable effort. I'll give credit where its due, and JD is on the mark with this one. Considering that I associate these guys with youthful misadventures followed by horrendous morning hangovers, I'm impressed with the quality of this one. It's good to see that the big guys are capable of putting out a solid product. Let it be known that this is far superior to Old No. 7 and Gentleman Jack. Well done JD."

4.25,"Vanilla bomb.  I'm no particular fan of standard Jack, but these Single Barrel Selects have consistently impressed me.  For this tasting:

Neat, Room temperature, no water added in subsequent tastes, from a Nolan glass.

The nose is vanilla and banana.  Pure Jack, but the best of Jack.  This bottle has been open for a while and is about half full, so it has certainly opened up naturally.  I think I'd expect a bit more ethanol from a freshly uncorked bottle.

The palate is vanilla, vanilla, and more vanilla.  Love it.  I'm guessing this might be an older barrel (rick R-5, barrel 16-3220, bottled 5/11/2016).  I say that because I'm also getting some oak sweetness and a bit of tannin in here too.  I wouldn't call it complex, but I would call it tasty.  Still a little hot, but I'm not complaining.

The finish is much longer than I'd expect from regular Jack.  Leave the entire mouth feeling coated and warm.  Vanilla dissipates to leave baking spices behind.  The finish is the weakest leg on this three-legged stool, but it isn't bad."

The nose has a strong vanilla aroma with cinnamon and honey. Palate is sweet and quintessential Jack Daniels, with vanilla and some banana. Finish is smooth with spices and pepper.

I found I preferred this whiskey with a few drops of water, which seemed to deepen some of the flavors on the palate. Still not my style, but this really gives a glimpse into how JD can make a good sipper."

4.0,"Taste:  2 oz Glen Cairn, neat.  This is Binny's Select Barrel 3904 bottled on 6/12/19.  94 proof, NAS

Nose: (4.0)  A bit faint but all the right stuff can be found.  I get vanilla pudding, sugar cookie almost like a snickerdoodle, and a bit of barrel char.  The only thing I detract for is that the great smells are a bit muted.

Taste: (4.25)  Peaches come through on the front palate.  Peaches give way to vanilla wafer and what can best be described of the burnt sugar crust on creme brulee.  There also is a bit of smoke and oak towards the end.

Finish: (3.75)  Quick to medium and that was the drag down.  Would have liked more intensity as I got a lingering note of butterscotch candy and that puff of charhouse smokiness which was very pleasing

Overall:  The selectors at Binnys have again done some fine stuff.  They selected a barrel that doesn't dissapoint!  Eons away from the sticks and charcoal of Old #7 here.  This is a sophisticated showcase of what a good Tennessee sipping whiskey is made of.  My only regret is that the favorable nose and palate may have been muted by the lower proof.  I would have loved to try this at the barrel proof.  Gets my gears rolling on the next dram of Jack Daniel's.  All the makings of good stuff and at the price this is no dissapointment"

3.5,"I purchased a 375 mL for $26.95 on sale, it is typically $29.95 and the 750 mL is $56.95. I've always been curious about this bottle, but the price was daunting for a name brand single barrel. I'm glad I was able to buy it on sale, because it is certainly better than Black Label and Gentleman Jack but still not worth the purchase price.

The nose is stronger and more pleasant than their base offerings and is the best part about this whiskey. It is remarkably similar to Woodford Reserve and Old Forester. Even with charcoal filtering, you still get that signature Brown-Forman nose of cinnamon, oak, and banana. What separates this from Woodford and Old Forester, and also the Black Label and Gentleman Jack, is this Single Barrel Select is less sweet and drier on the taste. At least from memory. I also have an Old Forester 1897 open and this barrel is more oak and tannin forward. My guess is this barrel is on the higher end of the 4-7 years age that is estimated for their single barrel choices. I also get black pepper on the taste and finish in agreement with multiple reviews I've seen on other websites.

Do I recommend buying this? I do not. I like this whiskey, but for $57 you can buy a ton of excellent bourbon at or below that price. This is severely overpriced for what it is. Gentleman Jack at 80 proof is $34.95 when you can get another premium Tennessee whiskey, 13-year old George Dickel BiB, for $35.95. Charging nearly $60 for a 94 proof single barrel without disclosing all of the barrel information is egregious to me. There are multiple barrel proof bourbons available in NC cheaper than this bottling. Plus, the Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Barrel Proof is only $13 more. I haven't had that one yet, but I imagine it's a much better value.

The nose has toasted marshmallow, oak, rye, baked bread and subtle dusty peanut can.

The palate has honey, vanilla, oak, rye spice and peanuts.

Finish is medium with an undeniable peanut flavor that lingers. There is also an ethanol note that happens right after you swallow following a slight bitterness.

This was interesting because I didn’t get any artificial banana notes like I normally do with standard Jack Daniels. This particular barrel had more nuttiness going on, which is not what I get from JD. Obviously your single barrel might be different than mine, but it was a fun experiment and I like this one better than regular JD or GJ."

So far, the majority of my tasted drams have been from the Celtic countries, while the choice of US drinks is very limited as, understandably, it appears that mainly the better known ""international"" brands are imported in Ireland. Of those I have tried I have been impressed by ryes like Rittenhouse BiB but not a bourbon (yet anyway). 

I tasted this JD Single Barrel Select as a sample from a gift pack that include No. 7 and Gentleman Jack. This is by far my favourite of those three. I'm not a fan of banana flavours, which I see from other reviews is a JD signature note.  I didn't get it on this which is a tick for the Pro column. I get brown sugar, oak, some tannins and a pleasant spice tingle as it develops and finishes. Good but no 'wow'  factor. 

But what surprised me was when I went the well trodden JD&C route. I had this over Christmas with Fever Tree Madagascan cola mixer - it was fantastic! The vanilla was brought to the fore, the oak remained and the tannins dissipated. And it mixed much better than other drams with the same cola (e.g. JW Black). 

Still searching for that straight sipper though."

3.5,"Very clean but heavy fruit nose with vanilla in the background. It does have a berry-sweet beginning on the palate, followed by a alcohol nip and bananas leading into a lingering oaky finish. Very intense and good to drink at the end of a long week!"

3.75,Giving a second review....I enjoy this and will buy again but wanted to say that each bottle truly is different. Both were unique and had very distinct tasting notes.

2.5,Tastes a little spicy with some of that classic Jack Daniels sour mash aftertaste.  I guess I'm just not a Jack Daniel's kind of guy.  Tasted neat.
3.0,"The nose is candy sweet, bandage.  Taken neat, it's not as sweet as bourbon - but the finish is not dry.  Good!   Adding a teaspoon of water doesn't necessarily mute the initial nose by much.  But the palate is not as cohesive - and a little thin - when compared to a similar-ABV bourbon.  This is where the banana note - characteristic of JD - is picked up.  Not much of a hit, but not much of a miss either.

4.75,This is terrific. Got the Eric Church Chief version
3.5,"In Jack Daniels family, i tend to think that Old No.7 es the cheaper core version, followed by the Gentleman Jack, finds this Jack Daniels Single Barrel in a third more fancy place. 

Bottled at 45%, with a polished mahogany color. 

As soon as you open the bottle, you will notice this is a more perfumed, elegant version of the traditional Old No.7 Jack Daniels.

On the nose is very appealing, with the classic grape and winey notes of Jack Daniel's,  but also with wet forest, Caramel, lemon peel and homemade vanilla Cake notes. Quite beautiful Aroma. 

On the palate is not that pleasant at least for me, making this dram the less desirable of the 3 core expressions of JD. As soon as you taste it, there is this full bitter sensation, mixed with oakyness. The body is medium-full with a sour note mixed with old purple grape peel, then kicks in a spice bomb that resembles a mixture of wasabi, pepper and ashes, which is too rough for me. The finish is long, comes from inside your throat to your mouth, with a solid cough syrup note, that you can chew a little.

Overall it felt like a strong spicy wine. I know some will love it, but it is not my type of dram, and i consider myself a Jack Daniel's fan. 75 out of 100."
3.75,"Nose opens with fruit (specifically cherry and maybe apple - it’s very fruity and floral) and vanilla and is followed by spice. The taste matches the nose with fruit, vanilla, and spice but also adds sweetness and leather."

4.0,Barrel 20-00893 My first time with JD SBS and I was impressed with this one. Sweet caramel and honeysuckle on nose. A nice spice level and more sweetness and smooth in the mouth and going down. Not a long finish. Definitely will try more.

3.75,"At 47% it comes off as stronger and more forward, so that’s why I knock it. But besides that, it’s very sweet and fruity. Banana bread comes across clear as day. Brown sugar, butterscotch, some good oak and wood coming from the charcoal filtering, and vanilla sing back up. Tasty for sure, but worth $45? Ehhhhhhhhhh there are better things out there at the same price point and proof point. I wouldn’t turn it down, and it’s certainly unique. Good and a soft ‘buy’ endorsement comes with it."
3.75,banana bread mixed with cinnamon toast crunch and a spicy finish.

4.0,"I genuinely can't decide what I think about this whiskey.  So I'm on vacation and I wanted something casual to sip and I wanted it to be something I've never had before.  So here we are.  On the nose, that Jack Daniel's smooth, hot, bite comes through.  For me, Knob creek has always been the top of the list when it comes to bity American whiskey.  This is bity, but luckily it has a smooth way about it.  It's kind of like James Bond.  He packs a punch, but he still knows how to be suave and have a martini in a tuxedo.  And this is why it confuses me.  I can't tell if it's a simple, harsher whiskey, or a richer, more elegant one.  At the end of the day, it lives up to what I expected of it.  It isn't overly challenging and it is reasonably pleasant to sip on.  The nice corn sweetness coupled with this banana note on the palate does make me appreciate Jack Daniels as a brand more which is always a good thing."
4.5,"Heavy Carmel with a little bit of vanilla, some spice and sweet corn...at 94 proof it is very smooth!"
