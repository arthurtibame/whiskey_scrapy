3.0,Decent but a little flat.  Would be good in a cocktail
4.5,"Really smoky and oak wood in nose and tongue. Rye spice holds up across the pallet. Leather and wood finish. An acquired taste perhaps, but worth it. It's not going to be great in every cocktail, but straight with ice, or with amaro like a Manhattan... Ahhh Yes!"

null,This is far and away the worst bourbon I've ever had. This tasted like bad tequila. Terrible. Don't buy this swill.
