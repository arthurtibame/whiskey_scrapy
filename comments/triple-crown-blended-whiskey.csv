2.0,Sweet with a distinct burbon twang to it. Not to bad for the price...a splash of water cuts the alcohol burn and mellows it out well.  Store in the fridge for a quick drink

4.0,"Triple Crown has a amber-gold appearance and no noticeable alcohol legs. The aroma is of spicy, sweet corn, with some oak (from the added oak extract?). Taste is of mild vanilla, sweet, light candy sugar, and grain alcohol. Mouthfeel is low medium, and Triple Crown finishes with a pretty quick drop off. RJT"

2.0,"Color: The color I find on this blended whiskey is a light straw yellow.
    
    Nose: I get notes of corn and cornbread, but also nail polish remover. It's a constant balance of good and strange smells, like pine needles and butterscotch cookies then Windex and car exhaust. 
    
    Taste: The palate is sweet with caramel latte which is nice, but there is not much going on beyond that except like a plain rice vibe and alcohol.
    
    Finish: the finish doesn't have any burn, but it's quick. It's not good or bad, it just leaves you curious if you missed it.
    
    Thoughts: I'm bummed really. I knew this dram going into it wouldn't be my favorite, but I try to be fair and let everyone play and have a turn on this whiskey playground. It's better than I was expecting, but that still isn't saying much. I will say this: This whiskey admits to having a 20%/80% ratio of bourbon to neutral grain spirits respectively. They claim on their website, “The 20% Bourbon is the most expensive bourbon ever created.” That's a bold claim, but I'll go on record saying, “If that's true, I'd love a taste of that bourbon before it gets blended!” Not my thing, but if it's yours, sláinte!"
