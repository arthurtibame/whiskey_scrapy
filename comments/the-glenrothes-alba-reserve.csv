4.0,"Distinctively Glenrothes but a little lighter than the standard reserves, most likely due to the single aging cask. Very bright and very drinkable. Excellent with a splash of water."

4.0,"Vanilla and ginger nose.  Clear lighter color.  Smooth, not harsh, but also not long lasting.  Lovely  if looking for something different"

4.0,Finished the bottle tonight. I pulled out the ginger quality and has a more harsher initial sip which  settles down to a smooth and easy finish.  Drank most of this camping and was perfect for the fireside dram out doors!
3.0,Fresh.

4.0,"My first Glenrothes ever was a good one. Bottled at 40%abv with a pale staw color. 

On the nose it is very nice, with grape juice, butter cookies, tobacco, chocolate butterscotch notes. A little dim but very good. 

On the palate, main notes are oranges, orange candy, pleasant oakyness, spices, ashes, and cough syrup. Mout watering medium finish full of spices.

Overall it is an 82 out of 100, a nice Whisky."

4.0,"Light golden color. Long legs, coats the palate. I get some vanilla, coconut, banana and oak. Smooth, sweet, very little burn. I get some herbs and florals too. A nice dram for a chill evening that you just to sip and enjoy and is not overwhelming."
