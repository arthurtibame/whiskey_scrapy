4.0,"Here is an unusual beast.  It’s a 4 year old from Sweden’s now closed Grythyttan distillery.  The casks were bought by the Swedish bottler Eld Vatten.  This one is slightly peated at 15ppm, and matured fully in ex-champagne barrels.  About 350 bottles were ever released, making this quite rare considering it’s from a closed distillery.  

So, I had a few friends over last night and I had this blind ( label removed ) along with about 3 Trader Joe red wines ( each around $4, also labeled removed).  The TJ wines were done and finished by all.  This here was only appreciated by a whiskey drinker.  She ( yes..she) guessed it was a 10-15 yr old Springbank.  She had a good logic for that—-there’s a certain dusty, old library with a bit of sulfur aroma to it.  The taste is smoke, honey and red apples.  There’s a bit of herbal aftertaste, like thyme and rosemary.  Really unusual.  It’s by no means a “beginner “ whiskey.  It’s different, like nothing else.  She liked it enough to polish off 1/2 the bottle and ask to take the rest home."
