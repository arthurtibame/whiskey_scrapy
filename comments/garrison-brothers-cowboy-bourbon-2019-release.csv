4.5,"Mash bill of 74% corn, 15% wheat, 11% barley. This is a hot whiskey, at 137.3 proof. But with a little air and water, it settles nicely. It’s good juice, and more than just a high-proof novelty. If you like ‘em hot and have the scratch for a high-end whiskey like this, it’s worth having in your bourbon collection."

5.0,"Great stuff smooth for a near 140 proofer. This is full of flavors and depth with notes of cherries, dried fruit, caramel, white milk and dark chocolate, marshmallows, pepper, cinnamon, cloves, mint, brown sugar and pecans like in a pecan pie, vanilla, and honey."
4.5,Smooth up front with a peppery finish.

4.75,"I was fortunate enough to get a sample of this Bourbon over the weekend and let me tell you it's definitely something special. Before I dive into the review let's discuss what is in the bottle:

1) It's a true grain to glass Bourbon out of Texas. The specific expression is the 5th edition and was limited to just 6,440 bottles

2) It's a Wheated Mashbill featuring all local grains

3) It's age stated at 5 yrs and aged in barns that routinely encounter temperatures in excess of 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

4) It's un filtered and bottled at Cask Strength coming in at a whopping 137.3 proof!

On to the notes:

Holy crap... There is no way this is 137.3 proof... If I personally didn't pour the sample I would have assumed it was mislabeled! Very rich entry that's loaded with caramel, marshmallows, chocolate, leather, and a long oak driven finish. Freaking fantastic!!

It's really an outstanding pour. 1/4 point deducted for value otherwise it's everything you want in a bourbon. Cheers all!"
