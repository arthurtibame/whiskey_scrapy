3.5,"This was a little hot on the front for me. The flavor was probably too complex for my simpleton taste buds, but there was a good bit of acetone, I know the proof would provide more heat, but I was hoping it would be smoother. The finish, however, was excellent. This would probably make a mean old fashioned, which is what I plan to try next."

null,"Carmel on the nose, but light. More of a butterscotch aroma. First sip: flavorless across the pallet. Very warm finish, nice and long. Might need some ice to bring out the flavor. Second sip: butterscotch, albeit extremely light on the tip of the tongue, then again on the sides of the tongue, between the mid and back pallet. The aftertaste is very dry. After a few more sips I am convinced that I don’t really care for this one. I’m bummed because I wanted to love it so I could search for a bottle. PS, there’s a little apricot in there. **Edit** Turns out I had a cold when I tired this and literally couldn’t taste anything I ate for the next few few days.  I’ll have to try this again in the furture."
4.75,I could sniff this butterscotch oak bomb all day. This is so good. I drinking it with Pappy 15. Both are amazing but this is better. The finish is long. The oak is sweet. The additional proof is spot on. If you can get a bottle do not hesitate. This is second only to WLW.

4.5,"Well done. Very balanced. Nose is cereal/grains, oaky/woody, cherries, maybe vanilla. Taste is cherries with cereal. Nice hints of oak. Finish is return of the cereal and wood with some vanilla. This is not a strong or hot bourbon. Tastes are subtle. I recommend no water or ice."

4.25,Plantain and Vanilla on the nose.  The palate is a Complete 180 from the nose.  Hints of straw fading to brine into the inevitable heat of the 101 proof

4.5,"Much better than the previous and great in general. 

The nose for me is dark caramel forward with light apples and cereal on the edges.

There is a slight spice to the whiskey that's filled with dark cherries and more caramel.

The finish is a rush a dark cherry and a return of the cereal to blend with the dark caramel.

Love the finish and the balance of the whiskey overall. Pleased that they were able to develop a redemptive product this year."
3.0,Sweet smell a Lil alcohol in the nose.
4.0,Oak and berries on the nose. Cinnamon and custard palate. Not too hot at 90 proof. Delicious bourbon worth $22 a pour.

4.5,"The color is a rich anger that heavily coats the glass and starts there. The nose sweet and oaky with citrus, char, pastry cream and caramel coming together for a wonderful experience. The palate is very smooth and oaky with a hint of spicy pastry cream, creating a very rich and chewy palate. The sweetness keeps the palate together, with creamy oak and pastry cream linger for a medium long finish, while the palate comes together and fades nicely."
4.75,"Nose: heavy heavy cherries. Very smooth. Buttercream. 
Palate: very spicy but smooth. Cherries on the secondary and a good amount of oak to finish it out. 
Finish: oaky and sweet. Very very long finish and so smooth all the way through."

4.75,"Dreamy. Nose full of honey, wood, and dark fruit. Don’t stick your nose in the glass, let this one come to you, because it really blossoms... and if you get too big of a nose it can overwhelm. Cherry and vanilla on the palate, sweet and smooth with just the right amount of spice joining the party late... neither syrupy, nor punchy, nor over-oaked. Finish lasts forever, with the fruit exiting first and wood/spice lingering with a pleasant warmth. Unlike some of its barrel proof BTAC siblings, this one’s a soft-spoken all-star."
