4.0,"Currently challenging my long-time Go-To Cheap Scotch, Ardmore Traditional Cask, for that distinction. This is good and simple stuff, a steal at $24 a bottle. The nose is very agreeable and round -- some sweet peat, tart fruits, and malt. Reminds me of Golden Fruit raisin biscuits. Single-minded but solid on the tongue, buttery, very creamy. Vanilla icing comes into play. Touch of pepper in the finish. A best buy, for sure."
4.0,"For those who like the smoky end of the Scotch spectrum but wince at the price, this affordable Islay blend is quite satisfactory."

5.0,"The best value Islay around. It's 40% Laphroaig, so if you like Laphroaig but find it a bit much, give this delicious cheapie a try."

3.0,"In general this bottle has the characteristics of a younger blended Scotch.  It is not overly complex and lacks the subtlety you would find in an older offering.  That being said it is an easy drinker and factoring in the price for quality I would/will buy this again.  Islay Mist 8 YR is a very affordable pour when you are looking for a simple peaty drink.

Nose: sweet, briny, peaty with a weak leather undertone

Palate: Oily sweet, vanilla, hint of yeast, you can taste the smoke/peat as well as a hint of iodine.  After a few sips I even get what I would call a hint of moss laden water.

Finish: Fairly consistent start to finish experience.  After a second or two there is a small experience of sour/spice"
3.0,"I love huge peat so I bought this to try as it was only 19 dollars at my local store. It's not peaty enough to be a favorite of mine, but nothing is at this price. Its actually very drinkable, and seems to me like a poor man's highland park. I like the light bodied quality.  It's not very complex, only 40% so very little burn, and clearly young, but the Laphroaig in it gives me some of the smoky quality I crave. Due to the price I'll keep a bottle around."

4.0,"Reminds me of a briny HP12 without the sherry. Amazing for the price. N: vanilla, soft peat, sweet grain. P: more pronounced smoke, iodine, nuts, baking spice and grain. F:  brine, salt, seaweed and nuts. Update: youth and grain really showing through when comparing this to CB Glasgow Blend."
5.0,"I picked up a bottle because I was trying to find an inexpensive Islay blend.  I read reviews of other good peated bargain blends  (Teacher's, Black Bottle, White Horse and Black Grouse) and found that all four have changed their signature malts due to the rising cost of Islay single malts.
This blend's signature malt is Laphroaig and the peat and smoke make for a very pleasant drinking experience.  It is a great value for the price."

I call it the burnt martini and it works on so many levels. I have now just made myself thirsty...get a bottle, you never know when you'll want to use it."

3.0,"This is great for the price, it stands a head above the rest of the bottom shelf scotch blends. It’s pretty much a younger Laphroaig 10yo cut in half with grain whisky.  It has that lemon candy body with a smokey finish...just its toned down to a “beginner” level. It works for an easy drinking sipper on a budget...something to pour when you don’t want to think about what you’re drinking, or maybe a starter for a more advanced flight."
4.0,Peat and caramel / chocolate on the nose. Peat on the taste with plums and raisins. Sea salt. Caramel / Chocolate as well. Amazing blend for the price.

4.0,"É um blended de personalidade com idade declarada de 8 anos. Complexo para o seu preço! Pouco denso e de cor dourada clara, predomina o aroma e sabor da turfa proveniente dos maltes de Islay. Em sua composição ainda temos maltes de grãos de diversas destilarias da Escócia. No paladar inicia-se doce, equilibrado, com notas de maçã e baunilha, surgindo em seguida a turfa e permanecendo até o retrogosto. A finalização, ao meu ver, é longa, esfumaçada e ligeiramente salgada. É um ótimo custo benefício para quem está iniciando no universo dos whiskies defumados."
