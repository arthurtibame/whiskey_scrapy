3.0,"""So, thanks to @Richard-ModernDrinking I am able to try a few more variations of the Compass Box Great King St Artist’s Blend Single Marrying Cask.  This is Artist’s Blend refilled back into some of the casks used to make the original blend and aged for another year, then bottled at near cask strength. This particular cask (No 10) was bottled at 49% ABV and offers a deeper reflection of what the Artist’s Blend can be if left alone a little longer.

So, this is the third different batch I’ve been able to try.  The other 2 were a little more fruit forward than this bottle.  This one had some nice florals, but was more grainy with heavy oak notes.  It reminded me a lot of a bourbon.

The palate was hot and slightly abrasive.  Some corn and vanilla notes crept in but this was still overly grain heavy.  The mouthfeel was a bit drier than the others- which left the finish on the hotter side.  It was long with some sweet, candied corn left behind.

I’d have to say that this has been my least favorite of the 3 I’ve tried so far.  It’s still highly serviceable, but if I’m grading it I’d say it’s holding steady at 3 stars.  Thanks again, Richard.  Cheers."
3.0,"The nose is more subdued than cask #1. The body is sweeter, making for a smoother finish. See cask #31 for more information on this series."
