3.0,"Very laid back, lacking spice.  But also an odd flavor I can't identify, that leads me to prefer Willets."

2.0,"Nose - Definitely smells like a young bourbon. Has an ethanol smell, like very young whiskey aged in a young sapling/green oak barrel. Light hint of mint and eucalyptus, slight hint of vanilla, burnt sugar, and a faint hint of honey are also present.
Taste - Hits the tongue with a boozy sweet corn taste, hint of vanilla, cinnamon spice and red hots. Faint bit of watered down honey and that's the extent of it.
Finish - Has a nice warming sensation, but then immediately transitions to this ""green"" oaky bitterness like if you were to chew on a young oak twig. At the very end there's this slightly sweet, but bitter taste, almost like if you licked some heavily burnt sugar.

3.0,Nothing spectacular. Very average. Little spice but not much of a nose.
