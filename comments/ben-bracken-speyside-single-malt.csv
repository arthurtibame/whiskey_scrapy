4.0,Not the best at room temp. Chilled with a little water brings it to life - spicy and slightly creamy.
3.5,Harsh on the arrival a bit sweet strong vaillia taste and smell all most like added vanilla flavorings put in very soft on the fruit side of it just a bit floral it lingers in the back round and then at the run very dry and quick so the best way to drink it and nose it is with some cold still water makes a difference on smell and taste I give it 4 just because I have had a few and it's the same every time no matter when I buy the bottle so its consistent and great value for money at £12 perfect for people on a budget and won gold and silver at the iwsc

1.5,Dried fruits on the nose and more of these on the pallet. Taste is very flat and short. Whole expirience lasts for two second including finish. Not worth drinking.

2.75,"Fairly easygoing Speyside at an excellent price from Lidl. An own brand malt, akin to a younger Aberlour if I had to guess its provenance. Raisin and fruitcake on the nose with some oak on the palate and a long, Sherry-sweet finish."
