3.0,"""Fruity and creamy"" is correct. Mellow, and easy drinking, but spending the extra few dollars for the ten year is highly recommended."

3.0,"Nose is only a bit fruity, nothing further. Taste is like a cake with vanilla, cream and white chocolate. Finish is a short alcoholic zing and bit of nutty/oaky bitterness. It's not one to contemplate longly, but I'd choose this for a night of heavy drinking over pricier but comparable (for example) Glenlivet or Glenfiddich expressions."

2.0,"picked this up as I went through Amsterdam duty free on my way to Munich. I only had a few weeks to get through it (travelling through other countries with only carry on luggage) so figured why not get something easy to drink, something I wouldn't normally buy, and, if I didn't get through it, I wouldn't care if I left it behind.
Fresh fruit on the nose, dried fruit on the palette with a hint of cocoa and slight nuttiness. Finish is short with some burn. To be honest, it drinks more like a blend. A couple drops of water only intensifies the dried fruit, nothing more. I've had worse, if that's something to be happy about."

3.0,This is a light coloured whisky that has no age statement.  In Australia it is priced between the world of blends and the world of single malts….is it a bridge over troubled waters or a bridge too far? It comes with a pretty decent nose. In the glass you'll notice orange peel and a hint of chocolate and vanilla. Medium bodied whisky leading with fruit and some butteriness to the mouth feel there is also a touch of jam and marzipan hiding in the background. These tasting notes might make it sound like a sweet Christmas cake dram but the flavours are not super rich here. Light tannin dry spice completes the picture. The finish is not long but nothing nasty in the tail either. The smoothness is noteworthy. There is a lot to like in this especially when it’s on special. So in the end not a heavy hitter by any stretch of the imagination but a decent quaffing whisky that can entertain when drunk neat.  So a solid 3 stars or 87.

2.0,"For a cheap single malt it’s just fine. But if you are looking for a good tasting regular shelf item this will not be a good choice. Strong blow on the nose and throat, herbal and sweet notes behind. Not my favorite kind of single malt."

4.0,"A Youthful Scotch, but full of malty and vanilla flavor. There is a hint of nuttiness, no peat, and a medium finish. If you like a well made Scotch unencumbered with heavy peat or raisiny sherry finishes, this may well be your ticket"

2.5,"Nose: Very malty, with a little lemon and orange zest, orchard fruit, and a dash of vanilla. There's a background aroma of fresh, sweet hay.

Palate: Light but well-structured. Malty-sweet arrival with a little citrus and nuttiness emerging in the development, hazelnuts and almonds especially. Malty milk chocolate, biscuits and caramel. The texture is creamy and very agreeable.

Finish: Medium. The palate flows seamlessly into the finish, with an aftertaste of weak black tea and malt biscuits.

A capable whisky at a reasonable price. The price point might lead some to think it is unworthy of serious consideration, but that would be a mistake. Whilst it is no powerhouse of complexity or personality, neither is it bland.

This whisky is subtle, friendly, relaxed and all about malt. From the first nosing through to the final flavours, the creamy texture, sweetness, nuttiness - everything about is says ""spirit-driven maltiness"". I think it's generally under-rated and perfectly suitable for enjoying neat when you're in the mood for an easy, mellow dram.

I'd also recommend it, alongside Glenfiddich 12, as a perfect whisky for introducing newcomers to the world of single malts.

""Average"" : 2.5 stars."
