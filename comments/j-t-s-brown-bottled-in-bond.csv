4.0,"Recently I’ve become quite the Heaven Hill fan. Not only for their flavor profile, but also their many quality “bottom shelf” offerings that are often overlooked. After learning of some mostly Kentucky only expressions, like this one, I was on the hunt. Now that I have one, let’s check it out!

The nose is sweet with confectioners sugar, corn, cooked plumbs, baking spices along with a little rye which brings out a ginger bread note, chocolate and light leather. A very pleasant and sweet nose with some spices, that are reminiscent of other Heaven Hill offerings, and yet still unique.

The palate is sweet and slightly coating with baking spices, a little rye, some mint, a little cut grass, corn, cooked plumbs and vanilla frosting.

The finish is medium in length with the front of your palate tingling which is followed by lingering sweet vanilla, spices and nutty barrel char.

Wow, this is a very good bourbon and at an exceptional value! This is one of my favorite Heaven Hill expressions, it’s a shame you can’t really find it outside of Kentucky."

4.25,"Nose is apples, oak, cinnamon, and maple syrup. Taste is cinnamon, honey, raisins, sugar smacks cereal. A light sweetness remains on the palate for a short while and quickly disperses."

3.0,"Taste - Sweet creamy vanilla caramels, hint of red hots sweet and cinnamon spice tingle, light oaky bitterness like that of an apple stem.
Finish - Cinnamon spice gradually fades, but lingers in the back, lightly artifical sweet barrel-aged vanilla infused simple syrup.
Score - 75/100
Final Thoughts - Has a pleasant nose, amazingly soft for a 100 proof bonded bourbon. A tiny bit hot on the palate with a creamy sweetness that starts out nice, but sadly transitions to a splenda-like sweet. Sadly this has a great front, but can't seem to deliver to the finish as the sweetness turns to an artificial sweetener which I'm not a huge fan of. I'm not sure I'd grab this as something to sip neat, but I can see it as a cheap mixer that will hold up well in drinks that aren't very spirit forward like a Kentucky Mule or whiskey sour."

4.0,What a great value! This $10 bottle punches well above it’s price and would easily fetch 3 times it’s value if it had a different label. Let’s hope it remains one of the best values in bourbon
3.75,"Despite the Brown name, the label is owned by Heaven Hill, fully exposed by the characteristic Heaven Hill peanut brittle nose. Riding along is vanilla custard, butterscotch, caramel, faint tobacco leaf, maple syrup, and sweet oak. Palate thins a bit, with caramel corn, cinnamon candy, and a bit of spiced apples. Finish is impeccably smooth for any bourbon, let alone the bottom shelf, with more caramel syrup, cinnamon, and a bit of brown raisins late to the finish. Sweet throughout and, although a ryed bourbon, one of the least rye presences around.

Highly recommended for discerning palates who don’t want to spend much, particularly those who like the butterscotch-caramel syrupy sweet juice"

4.5,"Nose: sweet caramel, cherry and cleaner, 

Palate: cherry and vanilla with a bit of burn. Spice like a wheated bourbon. Shocked at his good this is. 

Finish: short and dull with some cherry. Almost like a shorter eagle rare finish"

4.0,What an incredible bourbon for such a great value. I dropped one ice cube in to mellow out the hundred proof. Great flavor and good aftertaste. I like the sweet corn flavor that comes through.

2.5,"1.75l because of course.  Neat in Glencairn at home.  Nose is full of peanuts and rye spice, some oak and mild vanilla.  Fairly one-dimensional, but surprisingly solid.   Taste: rye spice, high astringency, bitter apple peel, oak. Not terrible, but I certainly understand the cheap plastic 1.75l packaging.  12/18/19"
3.75,"The price point alone makes this a fantastic bourbon. $13 a bottle, even though a touch green and thin, I’d drink this every day"

2.75,"Nose: Paul Newman

Palate: Sleeping in the attic because you’re fighting with your SO

Finish: Absolutely

Everyone deserves a cheap go-to bottle of their very own. Something that excites you when someone points to it and says “what’s that?” 
Usually you find yourself saying “no really, it is exceedingly decent.”
Paul Newman orders it in the way that feels like drinking it. Really cool, super confident, not pretentious. 

It may not be your thing, which is fine. You probably like something everyone else hates too; if you don’t, then something is wrong. Seriously, you shouldn’t like things that EVERYONE else likes. Or maybe you should... who knows? What do I know? More importantly who cares?

Getting a bottle of this is like when you were a kid and got Lunchables in your school lunch. Yeah, it isn’t the most complex or expensive, but dammit, it is fun."
4.25,"I hate this and no one should ever buy it... period!

First, the nose really pissed me off! It smells like everything you want in a bourbon, warm vanilla, with a touch of fresh banana bread. DISGUSTING!

Second, the mouth feel is buttery smooth and it tastes like everything you want bourbon to taste like, warm baking spices, sweet corn and lightly toasted oak. Can you believe the nerve of these jerks?!

Third, the finish has a slow rolling warmth that is void of all burn and leaves the slightest charred bitterness. I mean, what are they thinking?!

Finally, the value is incredible! $15 a bottle, common this is ridiculous.

Like I said, nothing about this is good and none of you should ever buy if you see it. Just pass on by and leave it for me to get rid of!"

4.0,"Nose... Fresh green apples, cherries, corn and caramel lead the way.... It's definitely appealing and harkens dessert notes all day...

Color... Mid copper to light mahogany...

Taste... Cinnamon, brown sugar, cereal, leather and toffee are abound. From start to finish the taste evolves as you'd hope it would...

Overall... This BIB from J.T.S. Brown is a solid as solid gets. As I begin to truly hone in on my discernable taste, I simply cannot find many flaws in the BIB rule I follow. At 4 years under strict watch and under mandated criteria, this line of Bourbon is just so so solid, especially at the cost..."
2.75,"Thanks to @saasbill for sharing. I mean, dollar for dollar, this is probably great but it’s not something I need to have often. The nose is actually OUTSTANDING but it’s rough around the edges and down the middle. If you have a few daily and need a cheap sipper this is better than it deserves to be for the price. But when I can get a bottle of Buffalo Trace for like $7 more I’m willing to spend it. I also have one or two drams per week at most so I am looking for something smooooooooooother"

4.0,"Nose: slight nuttiness, coconut, vanilla, quite sweet aside from that HH peanut thing

Palate: vanilla, sweet oak, almost a tea flavor, spice in the background, quite rich for a $10 bottle of bourbon

Finish: spicy and medium, but a crispy almost cola taste at the start

My favorite bottom shelf bourbon."
3.0,"Pretty ok.  For the price, you can’t beat it.  100 proof too..."
3.5,"Bottom shelf but more enjoyable than some whiskey that costs three times as much. Pour yourself a finger if you're out of Advil and the zombie screams just won't cease. If you have to use it as a molotov, you won't feel bad for throwing cheap liquor at the horde.

smells of honey and mint mostly
tastes very honey, with some pepper and subtle cream corn
noticeable but not overpowering heat that goes away quickly"
4.0,"Unbelievable value in 2018. No age statement but appearance is a golden brown, looks like a 6-8 year bourbon in a dark char level cask. 

Nose: butterscotch and toffee

Palate: creamy vanilla spice

Finish: short and to the point. 

This 100 proof bourbon has all the hints of traditional Heaven Hill juice, however the vanilla and butterscotch notes remind me of Buffalo Trace. 

Automatically a 4/5 for me due to its price for a fantastic daily sipper."
