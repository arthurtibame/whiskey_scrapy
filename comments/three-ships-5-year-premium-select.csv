3.0,"This whisky was voted the wold' best blended whisky in 2012 by Whisky Magazine. Not sure I agree. Better than Johnie Walker Red or Famous Grouse for sure, but a JW Black or Double Black runs rings around it. Very good value at $10 locally though."
1.0,"Woe is me for buying such rubbish! It may be peated, but it shall not be repeated."
