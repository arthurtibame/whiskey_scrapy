2.75,Very solid budget.
4.0,"I’m really surprised by this scotch. It’s surprisingly good, with a peaty, burned band aide taste, with briny, iodine aftertaste. Like a real good and expensive Islay ought to be."

3.0,A nice peaty and smoky blend.  A little harsh in the finish but overall a decent scotch for under $20
1.0,Nothing but iodine and burning for me

4.5,Strong peaty flavor and smooth with a nice fullness of flavor
2.25,"at first approach I was blown away. this is my first Islay Peated Scotch. All I got was deep smoke like if I threw a wet rag into my pit smoker for 3 hours and took a whiff. first glass was all iodine, brine and that same smoke. Like sipping dripping from a fire pit. I left alone for a week came back. this time it was a sweeter, more fruit notes coming thru but still harsh smoke and peat. Then I started mixing into cocktails, the Penicillin is a good one to approach this hell fire Peaty Scotch"

4.0,"Not a 4 star overall, but for under $20 it is the smokiest you'll find. If you like JW black but want more smoke on a budget, give this a try. If you drink a nicer scotch first you will notice the flaws, but as a starter dirnk it is very tasty."
