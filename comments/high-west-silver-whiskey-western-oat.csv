4.0,This is a great alternative..Try it with dry vermouth and grapefruit bitters with an orange twist. Yum!
1.0,"Don't do it! I thought, a novelty, sure. But I actually sent it back. I'll stick with their Bourye instead."

1.0,"Nose is familiar but I cannot place it. It is sweet and oat, but I cant place it.

Pallet is not to my liking."
2.0,Tastes like a slightly more flavorful vodka. It’s a novelty. I drank it neat. It was ok but nothing special. Probably would be a good mixer. Neat to try but won’t be something I rush out to buy.

1.0,Very simple. One note. I'm bored with it.

0.75,Tastes like overproof moonshine. Works ok in a hot toddy. And that’s it

1.5,"Wood fruity. 

Very strong note of vanilla and coconut.

Taste is harsh and abrupt with fruity tones."

2.0,"Nose - Sharp sweet ethanol notes, citrusy pomelo zest, pineapple, unripe banana.

Taste - Unripe pineapple sweet, citrusy, blueberries, sweet nuts, honeydew melon sweet, ""refreshing"" bitterness.

Finish - Lingering pineapple, mellow/faint blueberries, hints of honeydew more prominent, light fruity bitter.

Score - 55/100

Final Thoughts - This was an interesting silver whiskey. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either. It was amazingly fruity in nose and taste, nothing too terribly harsh about it, but this is definitely not something I'd reach for willingly. I think this was made to be mixed and I think it'd be a suitable substitute for a fruity vodka or gin in any cocktail that calls for a more fruity spirit.

Would I drink it if offered? - No

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - Not again"
3.0,"oat sweet and oily. good for unaged white whiskey, especially mixed."

1.0,"Doesn't taste or smell like whiskey, it's missing the nice complexities, which are replaced by sweet oats."

3.0,"Seeing as how it's clear and smells like tequila, better than I thought it would be. Unmemorable, but passable. Not sweet, nor vanilla. Dry. 2.5. On second pass, it DOES smell like vanilla."
