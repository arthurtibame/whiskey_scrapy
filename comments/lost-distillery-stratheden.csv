4.0,"have been curious about the Lost Distillery Company vatted malt recreations of closed distilleries. I found three of them available in a large liquor store in KC. All three are non-chill filtered and there is no caramel for color; all pour a light straw color. My purchases were Benachie--43% ABV--$50, Stratheden--46% ABV--$60, and Auchnagie--46% ABV--$60. All three have good legs in the glass. The Benachie tasts of pie crust, subtle dried fruit, honey, and distinct peat. Not a peat monster, but it is very present. The Auchnagie is similar, less dried fruit, no smoke, and a little sweeter and a pleasant spiciness. I would give it a 4.2 The Strathden is similar to the Auchnagie, though perhaps a little sweeter, the spiciness seems more peppery, a hint of smoke, and there is a mild astringency or saltiness to this dram. I give this one a 4.1 rating. I wish these were more readily avaiable and at a lower price; for there are several wonderful single malts out there equal to or better than these vatted malts at an equal or lower price. That being said, I am glad I purchased these and will probably purchase them again in the future. They are unique and are in a sense works of art--the blender's art. I respect and appreciate that. And I understand all that effort to match the various malts in the just the right proportions must be very labor intensive; and, that will also show in the final retail price. I wish they disclosed what whiskies they used in the blends as Compass Box does, but, that is life. Cheers!"
