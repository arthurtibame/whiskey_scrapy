3.0,"Three stars, but a glowing three stars--a better whisky than three stars would indicate. Very fruity (lots of apple), rye spice, clove, baking spice, warm rye bread. Light in flavour (lighter than 45% ABV would suggest). Lots of caramels and vanillas. Recognizably Crown Royal in profile (a bit of a dusty, almost sawdust-y character, and a bourbon-lite sort of character), but something nice and something different. Closest parallel flavour-wise might be a mix of Sazerac and a high-rye Canadian whisky. For the price, it's real nice."

1.0,"This is honestly a disappointing whisky. I cannot believe it was claimed to be the best whisky in the world by the whisky bible. Nose is overly sweet, typical rye. Palate follows the nose. Finish is alcohol forward and zero depth in complexity. Save your money and don't waste your time."

3.0,"Barreled review from December 2016. 


Another review from the brother in laws Canadian home bar. 

This whisky is 90% rye, not sure what the other 10% is but I would guess either corn or wheat. This one is 45% ABV, a copper amber color that I'm sure has colorant in it and probably chill filtered. 

Rye bread a plenty on the nose and again I get some baked fish. It's an odd sort of sensation to get fish on the nose of a whisky. There is some vanilla and cinnamon as well. Nicer than the Canadian Club I had just before this, but not remarkably so. Very light fruitiness in the background. 

Remarkably smooth palate that is spicy at the same time. Rye bread, and a bit floral. A hint of vanilla in there as well. There is something that gives a cooling sensation reminiscent of mint or menthol without the taste of either. Hard to describe further than that. 

Granted my knowledge of ryes is limited, with almost no American ryes under my belt, but I could see myself buying a bottle of this if I felt like a rye. I know it's a blend and therefore engineered to be smooth and easy to drink, but it's good. I don't believe it's whisky of the year good, but good nonetheless. 3.5"

3.0,Not sure why it garnered best whisky this year. Overly sweet with not much to recommend it in terms of taste. Admittedly my palatte leans more to Islay's so take my review with a pinch of salt.
3.0,"This was on my ""to try"" list before it was named whiskey of the year, but Mr. Murray bumped it to the top of my list. Picked up a 375ml on my last ABC excursion. This pours in the glass with a light golden straw color. Nose is pleasantly sweet, but alcohol heavy, with a definite rye note. Neat it enters thin and hot with none of the sweet transferring from the nose. Rye bread with a dill pickle note. Dry & Bitter, citrus peel, astringent finish that coats and unpleasantly lingers. It reminds me of my first (and last) taste of a small microbrewery IPA. A splash or a cube or two of ice does bring a touch of sweetness to the mix and reduces, but does not eliminate, the bitter citrus finish. Tried it in an Old Fashioned thinking maybe it would shine as a mixer but the bitter finish is still an issue. I definitely don't feel this is Whiskey of the year material. Glad I only bought the 375ml."

4.0,"Nose - Smells like apple brown betty in a glass. Toasted oats, faint hint of chocolate, caramel, cinnamon, nutmeg. Slightly sun melted apple jolly rancher.
Taste - Yup, tastes kind of like apple brown betty too. Sweet baked apples with brown sugar with a hint of cinnamon. You get almost no wood influence taste here. Starts off sweet and fades to something slightly bitter, like if you accidently bit into an apple seed. There's also a very very faint hint of dill in there as well just near the end.
Finish - The fruity apple slowly fades to the apple seed bitterness that's sort of like a grapefruit pith, but not as citrusy. Slight progressive warmth from the front of the tongue to the back, not really an alcohol burn, but a gentle warmth which is nice.
81/100"
3.0,"[NOSE] Instant appreciation of pleasant oaks. Followed by cinnamon, apple juice, brown sugar, honey. Bold alcohol hints in the background. [PALATE] Sweet arrival: brown sugar, some toffee.  Cinnamon, clove, fruity bubble gum. Light hint of bourbon gluey tone. Some burns down the throat. [FINISH] Peppermint, bitter orange, gentle spice. Short lasting. [COMMENT] This is not a typical rye whisky; relatively smooth & easy to drink.  But took me some tries to appreciate individual flavors. Great nose, ok taste, but finish is quite plain.

I also get a sweet fruit smell. Someone described it as juicy fruit gum. I think that is spot on. On the palate, this one is fairly light. The rye burn hits immediately followed by a light oak. Not overly complicated. Tastes pretty young if you ask me. Is this good. Yeah. Is it a great value for $35. Yeah. Whiskey of the year. Meh...."

4.0,"Okay, so after Jim Murray's declaration of this as the ""best whisky in the world"", I finally bought a bottle.  More so out of curiousity than anything else; normally I'd not even consider Crown Royal ( my apologies...not as a snob, but if I'm going to have my liver take a hit, I want it worthwhile).  I'm not sure if Murray actually meant this as the ""best"" in the world, or simply ""most unappreciated"".  The nose is floral and fragrant, palette is very un-rye like.   By that I mean that I can't detect the usual suspects like mint and eucalyptus cough syrup.  Instead I taste more spices, like nutmeg.  And candied banana.  Sort of like those sweet banana chips you find south of the border (like Mexico...not N.Carolina).  Finish is smooth.  I didn't expect this smoothness.  I expected a fiery, bitter finish indicative of youth or poor quality.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Crown Royal can be drunk as is, without mixing into soda?!!?   My very humble verdict...If in the next life, I am born as a world famous whiskey writer (among other things like famous bollywood movie star, husband of a Brazilian supermodel, and avid collector of Lamboriginis), I'm not sure I'd have this as my ""best whisky in the world"" choice.  I'd not even have this as my favorite rye (that for me is High West MidWinter).   But I'd surely have this as ""most under-appreciated"" choice.  And I'm sure my gorgeous Brazilian supermodel will fully concur, as will my billions of Bollywood fans."

This is one of the rare times where I think the Distiller tasting notes are spot on. Unfortunately, this whiskey suffers from a bit from being too uniform, and too easy to understand. It's tasty, but there is no depth to the nose or the palate. To he honest, I can't really recommend this whiskey. It is ok, and you won't go wrong in getting in, but you could get much better for less. I can't even recommend it as a whiskey to keep for your non-whiskey drinking friends. I'd say something like Dickel no. 12 is better for that."

3.0,"Say what you will about Jim Murray but I think the whisky world needs people to shake up the traditional orthodoxy and to generate conversation and controversy.  Crown Royal Rye is a noticeable step up from the standard Crown Royal (2 stars in my estimation).  Some nice spiciness on the nose, a vanilla sweetness and palate and mellow peppery finish.  There's none of the overbearing, cloying manufactured taste of the standard bottling.  Of course this is overrated, but it's an affordable Canadian rye that's easy to drink neat.  Recommended."

The palate is another surprise, opening soft and fruity, almost like an unpeated Highland, before moving into a very mellow mint that takes you to a slightly woody, astringent finish with just enough alcohol burn to ensure it's not overly sweet.

For such a high rye bill I'm surprised how much the grain takes control giving big caramel butter popcorn note. Oak is apparent throughout giving somewhat of a cider like aroma with vanilla ever present. There's some nice spice to it but for the most part sweet fruits and earth are in control making this whiskey closer to a scotch rather than what you would expect from an American rye. A pleasant and easy drinking dram. I usually don't drink the same thing over and over but I can easily make an exception for this one."

But, the nose is sweet and reminds me of baked apples and cinnamon, there's brown sugar, oak and rye on the palate, and a strange finish that morphs from the spicy rye to a more fruity, plum-ey taste with a sweet mintiness that lingers for quite a while.

4.0,"In celebration of Canada’s 150th birthday, I decided to open up a bottle of Jim Murray’s “whisky of the year 2016.”  I picked this one up on sale for $28.  As a Canadian who grew up in Toronto, I know how bad Canadian whiskey is, and of course I’m intrigued by a Canadian product that has made such a large splash.  While Jim Murray is probably the world’s best known whisk(e)y critic, he drinks over 1,000 whiskies per year.  That makes him an alcoholic – and alcoholics are not to be trusted.  NOSE: Big oakiness and spice.  The typical inoffensive vanilla and toffee characteristic of Crown Royal is hiding like Bruce Banner here.  The rye strikes a sharp second note.  Quickly, this gives the impression that this not the pacifist Canada; this is Canada circa WWI; this is FLQ circa 1970 Canada.  PALATE: So odd, a Crown Royal with bite.  Typical apples and pears fruitiness quickly gets taken over by oak and spiciness from cinnamon, spearmint, and cayenne.  There is a familiar vanilla sweetness definitely present, but dominated by the spiciness and bitterness of a 90% rye mash bill.  The mouthfeel is moderate, initially tasting like a low ABV whiskey, but as you swallow, this burns like it was 50+ ABV.  FINISH: There is a finish!  That’s a big accomplishment for crown.  The burn gives way to apples, pears, and toffee.  There is a grassy freshness and something a little funky.  Dare I say, cannabis oil?  The aftertaste lasts 3-5 minutes.  VERDICT: Not the best bottle of whiskey I bought in 2016 (that goes to Laphroaig 10 Cask Strength).  Not the best Canadian whiskey I tried in 2016 (that goes to Glen Breton 17 Ice wine cask finish).  Not the best rye whiskey I tried in 2016 (that goes to Whisky Pig The Boss Hog Edition 3).  But this is the best bottle of Crown Royal in the world.  Cheers Jim Murray Eh!  Happy Canada Day.  82/100"

4.0,"I hadn't drunk a 90% rye until this came in on a bargin and last year's world whiskey award recommendations.  I can see the notes are talking it down, but let us take it from where it is.  Raisins.  Raisins and a good spiciness.  It's good.  The aroma is nice and fruity, but the tongue feel is thin and the after taste is as well.  It finishes short.  The rye seems to give a good antidote to the sweetness of other north american corn based distillates.  It's a full 90% rye in the mash bill, which makes it an unusual offering.  I don't know what the remaining 10% is.  Overall, I like it's approach and can see myself drinking more rye.  But it needs to pick up the end of the dram to earn more from me.  Might be best in cocktails well married rather than a sipping whiskey.  I'll give it 85% for what it is."

5.0,"Visual:  In the glass it is a deep amber/gold color. Medium, lasting legs after a swirl.

Nose:  From a distance: floral and vanilla. Up close, more vanilla and, surprisingly, Juicy Fruit Gum in spades!  (Note: I wrote my notes before reading the Distiller review, and I found it interesting that Distiller noted Juicy Fruit in the palate notes, whereas I pick it up very distinctly in the nose). This is a good thing if, like me, you like fruit-bomb whiskies.  

Palate: More vanilla, with a touch of leather. The rye spice comes through a bit more on the palate than the nose, and the fruit morphs into more of the dried, trail mix variety. On the spice side, I detect some difficult to pinpoint baking spices and perhaps a soupçon of mint. 

Finish:  The finish is fairly long and drying, with some tannin bitterness and some heat from the 45% ABV.
Empty glass:  Pecan pralines.

This is one I think I could drink and drink. Do I think it is the best whiskey in the world, and worthy of Mr. Murray’s accolades? Probably not. Also, I’ve read some opinions on-line (after preparing my notes) suggesting that there is some notable batch variation, so it is possible that my bottle differs from what the bible author tasted. I can assert, though, that this is a stellar dram for the price, with its only real flaw being a slightly hot finish.  At $33 USD in my neck of the woods, it is a 5-star value, especially if you’re a fan of north American whiskies."
3.0,"This is an easy sipping Rye. There is some of the classic pepper, but Crown manages to smooth it out and create a mellow dram. I find the nose light, a bit boozy, and slightly sweet. Maybe pears. The palate is slow to evolve, I find vanilla, marishino cherries, light oak. No char or smoke.  The finish is medium, still sweet but a slow burn. After a few I find my mouth has that dry feel I get with Rye, but it's hidden with just one. (3.5 stars)"

3.0,"It's definitely pretty good but for me personally leaves a bit to be desired. Compared to Redemption Rye (similar mashbill) it's a decent but smoother. The Redemption will punch you in the face with it's spiced/Rye nose. I suspect this mashbill has corn in it where the redemption does not.

While this Rye is by no means bad I personally find it a bit lacking in terms of what I like in my flavor profiles. It takes a bit of the Rye punch off which can be good or bad depending on what you're in the mood for, but beyond the subtle/interesting nose (for a high rye mash) this ain't got much going for it. It's simply too smooth/subtle after the nose to really get much of anything.

Obviously these reviews are subjective. If you can find this whiskey decently priced ("

Sweet fruit and a little rye vanilla spice on the nose, with the sweetness carrying over on the palate. There is more rye spice there than the nose suggests, with warm cinnamon carried by a bit of vanilla. The finish is lingering and warm, very pleasantly so. Overall I tend to keep this one in the collection, and I would say it is a close 3rd for my favorite rye."

Does it remind me of a particular blue gel toothpaste with sparkles in it that I used as a child?  Yes.  But I also get dill, and an oak character that I usually only find in older and more expensive whisky.   Man. there's loads of different flavours in here compared to anything else in the range except Lot 40.   It drinks like something in a higher range.  I tried it back to back with Wiser's dissertation and could barely tell which one I liked more.  I think it's a steal at $35 cad (regardless of price increase), and feel if Jim Murray wouldn't have awarded it, it would have been considered a hidden gem by many Canadian Rye whisky connoisseurs.  I always really enjoy this rye."

3.0,"The boy is out; the wife is out. Me by my lonesome.  I had this 375 sized bottle I got some time back. Now is a good time as ever to have a hump day dram. 

Grilled apricots seasoned with dill arrives on the nose. The dill eventually turns more to spearmint.  Some honey notes and cloves and a touch of vanilla and yeasty, sourdough bread.

It arrives spicy and zesty. Once past the spicy sensation, the flavors pull forward.  Cinnamon, birch beer (the other root beer), butterscotch, leather.  The body is medium in density and yet, though the tongue senses the spice, it the texture is quite soft. 

The finish is the stronger part of the dram. Oak spice, spearmint, toffee with trace amounts of apples. Warming and drying that lasts for a good length of time. 

My goto rye for Old Fashioneds and Manhattans is Rittenhouse.  A great sipping rye, with some water is High West Midwinter’s.  This is pretty darn good as a sipper, though not as flavorful and full  as MWND.  Would I have this on my stock?  Probably not.  Though I wouldn’t think twice if the mood strikes for a spicy sipping rye.  [85/100][Tasted: 7/11/18]"

At its best, NH is somehow delicate, crunchy, aromatic and spicy all at once. This bottle has a lovely sweet banoffee aroma with a palate to match - the biscuity base comes through especially nicely. Sipping on it’s light, not syrupy, but still toasty and delicious with a long finish of baking spices.

After revisiting this one I’m knocking off a star. I get a lot of ethanol but not in a good way. This just doesn’t taste the same as I remember when I first cracked it open. I’ve been forced to add a few ice cubes to get this one down. 9/1/19

Update 12/4/19
Tried this one again as it has been sitting half full/empty for a few months in the cabinet. The ethanol has gone down and is now more ""spicy"" as a rye should be. Either this one has been changing profiles on me or it's my flavor profile changing. Probably a bit of both. Anyways, I seem to like this one again for what it is. Bumped up a 1/4 star. :-)"
2.5,"I have heard that this product is not consistent bottle to bottle. No idea if true or not. 
This bottle smells like a rye. The nose has that rye spike on top of a base of smooth, sweet, vanilla.
The taste is also rye and an interesting mix of approachable and rye bite. The base is smooth, not a lot going on until the swallow and finish. The finish is where the rye makes itself known with a spike of spice that subsides into a nice tingle on the tongue. The mouth feel is light. After a few sips I found that the rye tingle built and started a little sooner. The rye tingle and spice was still a spike: subtle, then a big spike, to a quick fade, and a nice lingering tingle. I like the lingering tingle more than the flavors. 
Enjoyable. Would not turn down. May purchase again but not an always have on the shelf. 
This in an odd spot for me. When I reach for a rye I generally want a more aggressive flavor experience."

2.25,"I’ve tried this five or six times, and it has taken over 4 months in the bottle for me to finally enjoy this. The nose is really fruity, green apple, plum, a touch of citrus, and floral. The taste is vanilla with a bit of citrus and green apple. The mouth feel is creamy. Finish is a bit off, kind of like nail polish remover. The finish really hurts this whiskey."

2.25,Pops of vanilla in the nose with notes of cut grass. Super soft on the palate with mild spice and woody notes. Fades into a quick finish.
3.75,"This has got to be one of my favorite whiskeys. Crown Royal has a bad rep, but this is good.  It is smooth and a little sweeter than regular Crown Royal."
4.0,Light on the nose with hint of sweetness and oak. Light and sweet on the palate like cotton candy with a kick of lingering rye spice.

Medium body, creamy in the mouth, sweetest whisky I tried so far.
Finish medium long herbal like licorice"
3.5,The best of Crown Royal’s stock in my mind. No need to mix as a cocktail it is good enough to be enjoyed by itself.

4.75,"Very strong floral and vanilla tones on the nose with a subtle hint of dried apricots. Slightly oily texture on the palate with an explosion of Creme Brulee and orange peel-Marmalade. A slight hint of spearmint at the end. A pleasantly surprising drawn out finish escalating the creamy vanilla, sweet custard with a dash of spicy cinnamon to finish. An amazing dram. One of my all time favourites."
3.0,Bit of a funky finish
4.0,A favorite

3.5,"If there's a hidden gem in your local store it may well be dressed in a white gunny sack looking bag bearing a tiny crown logo.   Because it's Crown or because it's Rye or because it's Crown Rye, this one get's overlooked far more often than not, and that's probably a bigger shame than just about anything being passed over in liquor stores these days.  That especially holds true since the Rye offering from CR is often one of the better deals going. 

So why is Crown Rye really all that?  First it's just a great rye taste with a nice sweet bouquet that forebodes the juicy flavors contained there in.  Juicy Fruit gum? Well maybe,  it is a sweet taster for a rye and that alone is worthy of some interest.  While not everyone may enjoy their rye with such attributes, Crowns offering not only brings the sweet flavors but as I always say, it's also as much about what isn't present in your liquor.  There is nothing young, green or otherwise inferior about Northern Harvest, it starts smooth yet spicy, remains juicy sweet through the middle and ends just as pleasantly. 

Northern Harvest Rye was reputedly over produced up front and wound up being found at discount prices, that glut is probably well passed in many areas but just the same the ""good deal"" awaiting may not be the one you wanted but is still waiting patiently, just the same.   If you like rye and haven't tried it yet, do yourself a solid and slosh down some Northern Harvest.    Highly drinkable and easy on the wallet.   We call that a win win."

3.5,Nice rye flavour. Not overly smooth. Some maple and oak notes. Great for cocktails and I always have a bottle in my bar for this purpose but wouldn't drink straight.

2.75,"I can't see myself drinking this straight, but it does have a bit of depth. The whiskey is harsh and its flavor is predominantly the sour bitterness of rye with hints of wood, occasional pops of sweet fruit, and an unfortunately oppressive layer of clove that makes up bulk of the finish. For its price, this is a very good whiskey and is a great choice for mixing."

3.0,"My first recorded taste, but I've had a lot of this.  It's something of a guilty pleasure, in fact.  I drink this on ice 80% of the time.  CRNHR is a totally casual drink for me when I'm just hanging around the house and want something tasty that I don't have to pay any attention to.  This is it!

This is candy - butterscotch, vanilla and a blush of pepper to let you know its a grown-up candy. If you try it neat you'll get a smidge of dill, a bit of allspice.  On ice or off, the barrel's influence is there.  This is a solid Canadian rye, not as colorfully full flavored as Lot 40 but it doesn't need to apologize for offering up its own take on being a polite, flavorful dram. This is a solid offering, a bit ahead of the pack in fact.  

Not long ago I ran into a 50% off sale on this.  I wish I'd bougth a dozen bottles, but as it was I think I absconded with 3. At the going price of $30 or so for a 750 this isn't a steal but it is a solid value. I think bottles of this will find a way in and out of my cabinet for years to come."
3.25,Not my favorite. Regular crown is way better

3.0,"Juicy Fruit gum on the nose with a bit of spice.. more fruit on the palate and smooth. Fruit continues through the finish with a little warm vanilla and the slightest hint of mint. I expected it to be sweet and fruity after reading all the reviews but was also expecting more spice from a 90 rye mash. Not missing the extra spice tho, this is a great neat pour."
