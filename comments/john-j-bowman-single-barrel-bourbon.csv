4.0,Nose is a little one note. I get a bit of black tea and fruit note. Taste has mostly the same with a light tea note and fruit. It is dry. Vanilla is rather light to not there for me in this barrel.

4.0,My favorite easily accessible bourbon and I firmly believe that an 82 rating seems a little low. Fantastic nose that reminds me of the inside of the distillery. Similar profile to the small batch but with amplified flavors and no bitter finish. Heavy vanilla and very sweet. Worth the $20 dollar increase over the Bowman Brothers in my opinion.
3.0,"Nice, but a bit pricey for the quality. Vanilla, cherry cream, and spice in the nose. The taste carries typical bourbon spice, vanilla ice cream and oak with creamy spice on the finish.  3.5 stars is closer to how I'd rate it."

4.0,I'd say a bit underrated with the 82 score. It's definitely buffalo trace juice which is a good thing in my book. Nice vanilla and cherry cola flavors - qualities I find unique to this bottle. Great balance at 100 proof as well. Hard to find in my neck of the woods and expensive ($55) when it is available. Worth a try for sure.

3.0,"Strong but pleasant nose, with vanilla, brown sugar, and wood. Numbing on the front end, which masks the flavors... flavors don't appear until the end, but at that point the heat also masks some of the flavor. The flavor doesn't venture far from the nose, which is a good thing here. Maybe if I could try this with some limestone water, it would open up, but alas, I'm at a restaurant now. Nice warmth going down, finish is fairly long but dry. 4/12/17
Apple and a strong note of potpourri on the nose. Pleasant nose. Sweet, some fruit and wood notes with warming spice on the backend. This is good, but flavor seems a bit thin compared to the nose and mouthfeel. 6/1/17 
Bottle has opened up with air time, more intense flavors. Stronger vanilla and floral notes. Very good."

5.0,"Toffee, Vanilla, with black pepper in the finish. Surprisingly similar to Elmer T Lee, despite having Buffalo Trace mashbill #1 (low rye, like Eagle Rare) instead of Elmer T Lee's mashbill #2 ** (high rye, like Blanton's). Apparently the 3rd round of distillation of Buffalo Trace juice in Virginia makes the difference.

** Mashbill: 
Its been long assumed that this is high-rye mashbill #2, however Master Distiller Brian Prewitt had indicated otherwise and had also been proven to be mash #1 here (https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/3vltda/review_29_john_j_bowman_single_barrel/cxp4szi/)."

3.0,"I went to a bourbon tasting last night after finally finishing up my long, holiday work week.  I tasted several new-to-me bourbons and ryes, and while this was more of a social gathering than an official tasting event I did jot down a few notes while trying to not look like a whiskey snob.  I want to give a quick review of several of the ones I tried, but don't expect a thorough examination like I try to do with a lot of my reviews.  Anyway, here we go...

Bowman Distillery is native to Virginia and I believe they are now owned by Sazerac.  Their normal bourbon is relatively popular here and they've gained more notoriety recently because they supply Hardywood Craft Brewery in Richmond with barrels for their infamous gingerbread stout.  Bowman has actually started reclaiming the GBS beer barrels and refilling them, after the beer, with fresh bourbon.  Thus, making gingerbread bourbon.  It has become another monster all in itself around the holidays here in Va.  Dammit, this review isn't a review but more of a history lesson.  Apologies, but I ain't erasing all that typing.

Anyway, on with a speedy critique of this single barrel:  there's heavy, sweet corn on the nose along with hot, peppery oak.  It also follows that same path on the palate, while being extremely hot and kind of harsh.  You can tell this is cask strength for sure and I actually think that makes it slightly worse than the normal 80 proof version.  All in all, Bowman is fine for mixing but drinking this neat is a bit of a chore.  They could really use some refinement when it comes to blending.  

Oh yeah, avoid the hype train on the gingerbread version- that train left the station awhile ago and should never come back.  Lol.  Cheers, friends."

Recommend the distillery tour (free),  no mash tuns obviously.  The stills are also very unique looking.   Very full flavored  lots of vanilla, caramel and black pepper with a great finish.   A bit of water really opens it up.    I agree with the other reviewers that this is way underscored and I think the head reviewer may be biased.  I would put this around an 89-92."

This is really a very unique Bourbon. I have not had another with a similar profile. The best way to describe it is a smooth bourbon crossed with Glenlevit. Upon entry you are hit with vanilla and brown sugar. Then on the mid pallette you get hit with a single malt type flavor that reminds me of Glenlevit. The finish is wonderfully long and full of vanilla, toffee and sweet tabbaco. The more I sip it, the more I like it. If you are looking for something unique and are a fan of single malt, look no further!"

Which is amazing since it is made using Buffalo Trace's Mash Bill #1 distillate. Maybe I have had luck with good barrels but in blind tastings of BT MB#2 products I snuck this in and it almost always ends up being rated above Blantons and Elmer T. Lee and falling short of Rock Hill Farms (every other MB#2 product does in my opinion). With all MB#2 products being nearly impossible to get in my area I have found myself happy to always see this on the shelf. At $50 it is pretty steep, if I could get it for $40 it would always have a place in my collection."

4.0,"Bottled in 2017.

This is close to a perfect bourbon that doesn't get enough love.  It failed to sell out at my local store despite a “highly allocated, one per customer” label.

This whiskey is incredibly balanced and smooth.  It is very smooth with sweet cinnamon and vanilla; yet it is balanced against undeniable dark chocolate, leather, and oak.  This is an NAS bourbon, but it tastes like it’s been aged for 8+ years.  This whiskey is on par with Four Roses Single Barrel, and absolutely worth the price of admission.

The primary takeaway from this was SWEET. I could not believe how smooth and sweet this whiskey was at 100 proof, almost like candy. This was very good at one note, but had no complexity. Maybe it was the barrel? Either way, I'll probably pick up a bottle of Small Batch or Port Finish before this."

Nice smooth creamy texture on tongue.  Feels thick on the tongue but then then on the edges as the oil comes around.  Brown sugar on the tongue.  Then uppercuts you with that vanilla.  Hint of cola persists on the legs.  Subsequent sips brings in the berries on top of the vanilla.

On the nose I get a lot of tart cream soda with some honey and a little sawdust. Gentle nose, but unique and pleasant. On the palate, it seriously tastes like some Blanton's bottles I've had. Not as bold but damn close. Vanilla, toffee, chocolate, caramel, oak, some char, spice, she's got it all and well balanced but like the nose, it's very gentle. Drinks more like a 90 proof or lower not the 100 it is. Medium-long finish. I wouldn't go as far to say this is a backup for Blanton's but a damn good dram on its own. Maybe I got a good bottle, either way, I'm impressed."

4.25,"After reading up on this one and seeing how this distillery is know owned by Sazerac (Buffalo Trace) and uses a combo of two of their mash bills, I thought I’d see how it compares to their other products.

Right away it reminds me of Blanton’s. So I poured one of that as well to compare

The nose has sweet vanilla, some light baking spices, and a hint of plumb.

The palate sweet and has a continuation of the nose with a little leather and oak.

The finish is on the shorter side of long.

Nothing really harsh about this one, except maybe a little ethanol vapor at first, but it subsides and is not noticed in the rest of the dram.
This is definitely in the same family as Blanton’s. Slightly higher proof makes it stand out. I would say the Bowman has a little more oak and blanton’s has more leather."
