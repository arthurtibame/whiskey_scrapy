2.0,Boring. With a burn. Can't taste sweetness or fruit. Even with water.

3.0,"If Newton had been a drunk, he would‘ve loved this one. Have an orange marmalade toast in freshly laundered robe beside his favourite tree. A mix of earthy tones and dried apricot. And some pineapple. The nose is definitely quite intriguing and better than the underwhelming tangy palate."

4.0,"Thick and floral on both the nose and the palate.  Vegetal hints, like fresh plant clippings in new topsoil show up early in the sip, but are quickly overtaken by a sweet burst of honey and vanilla before the cereal grans take over.  The finish is short and rather astringent, drying things out before cleanly fading.  It's not Green Spot, but it's worth $35 to give it a try."

3.0,"I don't have much experience with Irish Whiskey, but I liked this one. Pretty smooth and sweet. Not as complex as Scotch, but not peaty either. I can see myself drinking this when I'm in the mood for a simpler flavor than Scotch."

3.0,"A decent dram, though incomparable to the 12 Special Reserve. The nose is eerily reminiscent of apple picking season - like walking through an orchard looking for the perfect tree. The remaining experience is light and regretfully short, with a finish that almost suggests bananas. Smooth and unassuming."

3.0,Pretty unassuming for a 10 year.  Delicate would be a nicer word.  Perhaps my palette simply is not sophisticated
