null,"sweet and light taste. smooth with a little honey, fruity aftertaste with grainy finish."
5.0,"My diamond in the rough (heck, even the bottle is shaped as such). Incredibly tasty blend, outrageously unknown, and only 20 euros! Better than most entry-level single malts, for half the price. Why haven't you bought a bottle yet?! Best accompanied by Pusherman from Curtis Mayfield."

4.0,"A tasty little fellow. The Antiquary 12yo is very ""grainy"" on the nose but the peatiness on the palate delivers a good experience for any whisky drinker. This is a Blended scotch whisky thay belongs to Tomatin. 

Bottled at 40%abv

On the nose, grain whisky. Lots of it. Butter
Grain whisky aroma; Chocolate brownie and Lemon. 

On the palate it is very very good. Only four notes but very well done. Vanilla, Coffee, Dulce leche and mild Peat. Delicious.

Aftertaste grain whisky returns but the peatiness hangs in there. Butter, vanilla and peat.

Overall this is a normal blended scotch, its hints of peat help a lot. 81 over 100."

4.0,"This is not available in my area, so I shipped it in from a California source when they had it on sale. Wow! What a bargain! It pours neat a dark amber. It must have a fairly high proportion of malts in the blend---I swear it has some legs. Nose is sweet malt/citrus with a small touch of peat. Those hold true on the tongue as well--and linger on a smooth rich finish. I prefer this to Chivas 12. I think I like this and Dewar's 12 equally--but they taste different--so, I will keep both on hand."

Very beautiful friendly smooth and sugary but not too sugary on the nose and on the palate.
It is also very wallet friendly."
