4.25,"Sherry cask finish definitely adds fruity flavor, and smooth. Still a hint of spice. I am proud that Texas makes fine whiskey. Bold price too"
3.5,Not bad. I like it better than the standard bourbon. The sherry finish tempers the spice and adds some fruitier notes on the finish. It’s very expensive though
4.5,"If someone asked me to poor them what I thought was the most unique tasting whiskey I have ever had this would be the one. Witherspoon is a small distillery in Lewisville Texas started by an ex Marine. They make one run of regular bourbon and then do two special release bottles one finished in Port and one in Sherry. Imagine the darkest, richest, fruitiest and complex sherried scotch you can. Then add about 20% bourbon to that. Then use some magic to turn it all up some more on the richness scale. Well that would be this bottle. Just when you think whiskey has thrown you all that it can Witherspoon shows up and throws a curve ball. Lewisville should be very proud."
