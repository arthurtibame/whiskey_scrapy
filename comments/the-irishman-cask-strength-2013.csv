3.75,"A weekend of 4 Irish whiskey samples.

2/4 Irishman cask strength 2015 (small batch 227/2595)

Nose: custard, vanilla pudding, milky chocolate, slight coffee, fresh resin, whole grain cookies, christmas spiced orange, fresh cucumber. Some nice freshly poured light beer note as well. Although cask strength not overly noticeable alcohol. 

Palate: a fresh but fitting alcohol hotness, apples freshly cut, sprouted grain, overly ripe strawberries, a bid like blue cheese or French Brie in some way but combined with sour sweet white grapes. Interesting really. 

Finish: expectedly long with the nearly turned fruitiness equally sweet and bitter."

4.0,"Very intriguing. Bourbon flavours with a very smooth, genlte, malt tastes. Rather sweet and with a distinctive taste of butter cookies. Hot in finish."
