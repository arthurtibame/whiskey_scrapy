3.5,"The smell is chocolately with a bit of cooked sugar. The initial taste is the expected heat and cinnamon of a rye whiskey, but a sweetness slowly creeps in, and the same chocolate and sugar on the nose help guide the finish into a decent hot, mouth-coating, lasting rye flavor."

4.25,"Received in a 200ml sample pack of 3 cedar ridge whiskeys. Wish I had a full bottle of this one!  Unique, smooth, and with a long lasting tingle sensation, this one is interesting for sure. It is it’s own thing and I enjoyed it! Not a deep flavor, but the flavors are well done and so smooth it kept me coming back for more.  Batch 16. Bottle 3207.  Might have to add this one to the stash in the near future!"

4.5,"I have been curious about this rare malted rye, and it is finally available to me at a few shops here in Missouri. My notes are on a neat dram from Batch 3. According to their website the mashbill is 51% malted rye 34% rye 12% corn and 3% malted barley. I know that Distiller states that it is 100% rye, perhaps Batch 1 was. It has the rye flavor and spice, but, is not as sharp as most ryes. It has a wonderful soft, almost creamy, mouthfeel The finish is rather long with a gentle spiciness. I hope you live in one of the few states that carries this dram, or at least your state's dram laws are liberal enough to ship it in. This is truly a unique style of rye"
4.25,"Single barrel 2019 “Happy’s W&S” store pick.  92 proof.  Really enjoying this. Closest representation of Angel’s Envy finished rye I’ve ever had.  All creamy vanilla and cinnamon.  Not sure how the single barrel and slightly upped proof is vs the standard 86 proof expression, but this is impressive.

Clear, sweet, lactose-y cereal note on the nose - leftover milk after a bowl of Cinnamon Life.

A nicely-spiced rye but silky smooth.  Sweet Demerara with a creamy, oily body, then Big Red cinnamon that lasts and lasts.  Delightful tingle on the finish for a solid minute.

Not overly complex, but seems to have a target flavor profile and nails it.  Extremely impressed for a craft distiller.  I might go buy a few for the bunker."

3.75,"At first sniff, all I could smell was alcohol.  After first taste, the smelling note became deeper and richer.  Mildly chocolate.  Immediate taste is that of fruit, sweet fruit.  Ends on the same sweet note."

3.5,"Tasted at NWB on 12/19/18

Starts spicy rye, mellows to a white pear/banana, then surprisingly finishes smooth with a rye spice/white pear combo. Young but smooth, finish leaves quickly."
3.5,"Tasted at NWB on 12/19/18

White pear on back end. Rye spice up front follows through all the way to sweet spicy finish"
