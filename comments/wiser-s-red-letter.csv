3.0,"Red Letter isn't sure whether it wants to be a member of the old guard (soft, sweet, vanilla, butterscotch, mild, maple) or the new guard (American rye-esque spicy, intense, grain-forward) of Canadian whisky, so it splits the difference and no one is happy about the compromise--particularly not at the $100+ price tag. On the nose: lots of cedar, cigar box, honeycomb, green apple, stewed fruits. A bit solvent-y, with caramel, vanilla, light wood-smoke, citrus, and maple. Taste is quite light, with wood spice, stewed fruits, green apple, vanilla, caramel, butterscotch, rye breadiness, clean wood flavours, some citrus pith and distant dill. Gingery, woody finish. It's a nice enough whisky (and kudos for being, to my knowledge, the ONLY non-chill filtered Canadian whisky on the market), it's just wildly overpriced: Wiser's Legacy is, at half the price, the far superior entry in the company's line-up."
