5.0,It's bright. Fruity yet floral. Powerful peated islay style. It's a loud and young single malt with a special ham flavour
3.0,This hits the palette hard.  Very briney and peaty.  Somehow it doesnt burn your throat though.  I like the full bodied flavor.
4.0,"Cijfer: 8,5
Proefnotities:
Heftig, maar biedt toch te weinig meerwaarde boven de ""gewone"" 2007 vintage
Misschien moet ik ze ook helemaal niet met elkaar vergelijken. Cask strength is een andere league
Vreemde nasmaak in de afdronk"

1.0,"God this is bad. Like REALLY really bad. Look, I don't expect people to agree with me here - it's just a personal opinion. Imagine a hint of dentist with a touch of oil sands, with whiffs of cadaver. It also finishes long, which is a bad thing because I needed to eat almonds and pumpkin seeds 15 minutes later to remove the repulsive taste from my mouth."

4.75,"In a tasting glass at the Irish Heather in Vancouver. 
Not a lot of nose. Not a lot of color. 
A good whiskey in a narrow range. Decent."

3.5,"A bit heated, but then this could be expected at cask strength and price point. Lots of nice fruit and some smoke. Decent body and acceptble finish for price point. I got honey, some apple and pear notes along with the malt and smoke. Would recommend for those wanting to try a Kilchoman whiskey although I might suggest a wee bit of water."
3.5,"actually tried a bourbon cask single cask release. bottle 454/2008 61% Distilled 12.9.2008 Bottled 17.6.2013

Excellent. A peated Islay to the core. Wonderful nose and flavor. Great lingering mouth feel. Not to strong a burn given the percentage. Nothing bad to say. Lacks the punch of a Laphroaig or Ardbeg, but a great peated whiskey."
