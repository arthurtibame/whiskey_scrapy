4.0,Thank you Beam Suntory for bring back the 9 year age statement. Restored to its former glory.

4.25,"Dusty nose with a layer or two of complexity. Nice on the palate with a rounded feel, pleasant sweetness,  and just a hint of spice. Medium long caramel finish. Mmmmm."

3.5,"Very happy that this is back to being 9 years old. Combined with the proof I think KC is officially worth the money now. That being said I'm not sure I'm really a Knob Creek person. I wish it was a little less spicy and a little more sweet, and there are other bourbons I like a lot more, but this is an Eagle Rare-level of great value now, and it's certainly not bad."

2.5,"Golden. Cherry, caramel, spices, vanilla, honey. Hints of oatmeal in the background. Some other high strung floral and fruit notes I can’t quite place coming through the base notes. After time the bottle becomes pretty one dimensional and flat. Not bad, but the exciting notes kinda fade. 

Palate is round and confirms the nose. Some slight soapy tastes. Medium finish. Heard the 120+ proof KC is the one to go with. This one is a tad lacking. 

I still have a full bottle, so this rating will likely change. 

I use the rating scale below. Distiller uses a scale of 5 and I use a scale of 10, but I’m sure you’re not too drunk to do the math! 

1. Disgusting - So bad I poured it out.
2. Poor - I wouldn't consume by choice.
3. Bad - Multiple flaws.
4. Below average - Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.
5. Good - Just average.
6. Very Good - Better than average.
7. Great - Well above average.
8. Excellent - In a league of its own.
9. Incredible - An all-time favorite.
10. Perfect"

3.5,"Nice dark Amber.  
barrel dominates the nose.  Rich, dark oak, a good bit of smoke and burn, some eucalyptus...
A big bourbon here, especially for the price. 
Hot in every way, backed by some clove, spice, mint and bitter cacao.
Long finish with more bittersweet cacao, oak and clove"
4.0,"(neat, rock glass)
Nose: brown sugar, oil, prunes and similar fruits, with slight woodiness.
 
Taste: heavy charred oak and oil, robust. 
 
Finish: slight banana bread like taste with lingering charred oak and oil. Drinks hot with large sips or pleasant and short with small sips. It almost melts away with very small sips.

Overall: an interesting bourbon with a robust, sharp flavor. Reminds me of diesel fuel or crude oil? In a good way of course, interesting."
4.5,Lots of woody heat from beginning to end.

4.0,"**MOVING MY REVIEW SINCE THEY CREATED A NEW ENTRY**
THE AGE STATEMENT IS BACK!! Picked up a bottle of the new Age Stated version of KC Small Batch tonight and decided to test it head to head with the NAS version (I was gifted a couple 375s over the holidays).   

KC 9YR
COLOR: New Penny (Identical) 
NOSE: Spice. Hay. Old Oak. Fall Spice. Peanut Shell. Light Citrus. A general ""gooey"" Sweetness. 
NEAT: Medium Mouthfeel. Vanilla. Oak. Caramel. Cola. A building Pleasant Heat. Long'ish Finish with Oak and Vanilla coating the palate. 
SPLASH: Made this all Oak and Vanilla. 
RATING: 4   

KC NAS 
COLOR: New Penny (Identical) 
NOSE: Spice. Hint of Floral. Light Hay, Citrus. Dry Roast Peanut. 
NEAT: Thin to Medium Mouthfeel. HOT. Vanilla. Peanut. Spicy Oak. An Immediate Heat. Long Spicy Finish with Pepper, Oak, and Peanut Coating. 
SPLASH: Tamed a lot of the heat. Becomes mostly Peanut and Oak. 
RATING: 3.5  

Verdict: The NAS had an immediate prickly heat, while the 9 year had a pleasant building heat. The extra age obviously helps. Smooths out some of the rough edges and reduces the signature Beam peanut funk as well. Kudos to Beam for bringing the Age Statement back. My final rating is for the 9YR. It is between a 3.75 and 4, but I'll round up."

2.75,"Nose: strong vanilla, nutty, and  ethanol. Taste up front creamy brown sugar, then vanilla with baking spices followed by oak char. Good mouth coat and finishes with heavy char almost dry nutty on the tongue. Very typical burbon notes but a little heavy on the alcohol burn being only 100 proof."
