3.0,"Very similar to standard Jameson but a little more robust with a hint of dark fruit sweetness from the sherry. Not quite as smooth, and not nearly as caramelized as Black Barrel. $45 in Ontario."

4.0,"This one surprised me. 

Solid 4.0 for me. 

$44.95 in Ontario."
3.0,"Schöne rot-bräunliche Farbe, Sherry Fässer klar zu erkennen. 
Sehr weich und rund im Geruch, aber mit klaren würzigen und malzigen Noten. Überraschend wenig Frucht.

Im Geschmack eine tolle Kombination aus würzigen und fruchtigen Aromen die sich abwechseln. Danach leichte Schärfe mit Malz. Sehr angenehm im Abgang. Hinterlässt einen runden aber herzhaften Geschmack im Mund der Lust auf Mehr macht!"

4.0,The palate came across like pound cake to me but less sweet and more buttery. Incredibly smooth and easy to drink. pick it up if you're in Ireland.

5.0,"I found this this to be a very delightful whiskey. I don't always drink my whiskey straight, but of all the lower-end Jameson, this one was my favourite straight. Whenever I read reviews of all these flavours, I never really taste any of that. I just know what tastes good, and what doesn't, and Crested tastes delicious. Goes down smooth with a pleasant burn, a little spicy, which I like. It's no Writer's Tears (my favourite to drink straight), but it's a close number two for me."

4.0,"A (wider) re-release of an extant label (the ""Crested Ten""), Jameson Crested's biggest problem is that it doesn't really seem to know where it fits in the already crowded Jame-o line-up: more expensive than the entry level, a couple bucks more than the Caskmates, and pretty close to the same price as the Black Barrel. In the long-run, I think that confusion's going to hurt it, but on its own merits, the whiskey itself is pretty nice. Smell is pot still dough/yeast, big honey, caramelized sugars, vanilla bean, grass and hay, maple syrup, and some slight syrupy red fruits (berries in the distance?). Taste has a bit of heat for 40% ABV, and shows a lot of similarities to the entry level Jameson: honey, bitter citrus, chalky vanilla, leafy, grassy, hay, apple skins, almonds--but again, there's that hint of the sherried fruitiness, if only slightly (raspberries? underripe strawberries?). A bit peppery. Body itself is slight, but not underwhelming (though--as with all Jameson offerings--it's crying out for more proof), with a decent creaminess. Finish is warming honeyed sweetness and just a touch of vanilla. Faint fruit salad in the far, far distance.  A nice ""I'm not thinking about this too much"" whiskey, but I'm ultimately not sure if there's *enough* sherry character here (or added age) to differentiate it from the entry-level Jameson. Why the four-star rating then, you ask? Well, I guess I'm like Jimmy McNulty: never had a Jameson I didn't like."

3.0,Sherry is reallly overwhelming. I really almost can’t get anything else almost. The blend isn’t as complex as most reviewers claim maybe I’m biased cuz I like to have most characteristics to be somewhat available. Overall really good value for the price of similar Irish blends. A really good learning whiskey for people that aren’t familiar with sherry cask

3.0,"If you’re a Jamie fan, pick this up, it’s a nice variant on the original. But I’d classify it as good, but simple. Not complex, just a solid “daily drinker”. The best part of this experience is a nice mouthfeel...buttery smooth, oily texture. I don’t regret buying this bottle...once."

3.75,"3.7 / 5.  Mild nose with a gentle vanilla sweetness.  Low proof is evident.  Tasty.  Sweet, with strong orange rind dominating the flavor. A gentle nuttiness from the sherry.  Buttery pound cake (per another reviewer) is spot on, plus orange zest."
3.0,"Nose: after standing a bit, mainly alcohol and slight vanilla 
Taste: rather flat. 
Finishes a bit bitter on the sides of the tongue. 

Not the worst I had, but wouldn’t buy."

4.0,"Tasted from a 50 ml “Souvenir” bottle bought at the distillery. Sadly, not available in the US. Taste profile is very similar to “regular” Jameson, but with strong hints of sherry sweetness from the aging casks. Very easy drinking whisky that could easily become one’s daily dram."

4.75,"Probably the best whisky, so far. Its sweet but no too sweet, it isnt a bourbon-type but still the irish, and a good one for that matter. No smoke or peaty at all, for those who just dont like that, as I dont too. A proof for the aged-whiskie lovers that NAS whiskies can be really good, as long as its made with care, also a very cheap price for the quality!"

4.5,This is a very smooth drink. One Ice cube
4.5,"Picked one up at the distillery on Bow st. in Dublin. Nice whiskey! Good vanilla notes, lots of fruity toffee on the nose with a medium, smooth finish. Probably my favorite Jameson I’ve tasted, thus far."
3.75,"God og rund, kanskje litt kjedelig. Klassiker"
2.75,Veldig skarp start og en ganske aggressiv fremtoning ved første smak. Ettersmaken er tydelig røkt og kjenner svært lite av det jeg har blitt lovt at det skal smake. Drikkes den fort så er den ganske rund
3.5,"Sherry cask on the nose, sweet honey

Buttery maple, ginger shortbread kinda appley finish

Smooth lacking finish


Good every day for the price point."
3.25,"Maybe smoothness is enough to justify how forgettable Irish whiskey is? Weirdly grainier than the regular, with barely noticable hint of sherry."
