4.0,"With it being fRyeday and also being national craft distillery day I think it's fitting to feature this diamond in the rough! This specific expression is a cask strength single barrel picked by Century Grand in Phoenix Arizona. It's unique from the standpoint that it's both a single malt and also a straight rye! That's due to the fact that the Mashbill is 100% malted rye! Now I've had the batch product and whilst pleasant, it was nothing to write home about. This one however is very good! Why is that? Let's dive in... 

Upon entry it's soft and rich with a oily mouthfeel! As it hits your palate you immediately know you aren't dealing with your standard rye profile... Ginger snaps, toffee and cocoa are evident..  clove and chocolate covered oranges on the mid palate (for those of you that have had a Terry's Chocolate Orange this is a dead ringer for that)... Cinnamon, orange zest and oak on the lengthy finish... Finally the 120+ proof is felt in the best way.. This one is a certified sleeper... Cheers All!"
