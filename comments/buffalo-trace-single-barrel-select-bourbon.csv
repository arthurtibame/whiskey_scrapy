3.5,"Davidson’s store pick, Barrel 483.  Nose of baking fruit pastries, apples and pears with melted sugar. Very complex flavours, brown sugar and vanilla is replaces by toasted oak is replaced by a linger of cinnamon and baking spice. Very dry, somewhat spicy finish that feels like raw cinnamon and lingers.This is easy drinking, complex, and finishes with a punch, three contrasts that combine my favorite elements of bourbon. My fav. Of the Davidson’s store picks"
4.25,"Smooth, rich and aggressive in all the right ways. It’s enough of a difference and enough of level up over the regular Buffalo Trace that it’s worth the extra cash."

3.75,"Neat.  Neck pour.  Gallenstein #27.  Rich caramel and tons of corn.  Hint of cherry and a ton of oak.  More oak than a typical Buffalo Trace but otherwise on profile for the nose.

Average mouth feel.  Expected for the proof.  Just some cane sugar on the tongue.  Primarily cherry with a hint of oak of the taste.  Oak lingers.  

Perfect pour to give someone just getting into bourbon but a bit thin and bland for me.  I’ve had better Buffalo Trace SiB."

4.5,Gift from my brother for Christmas after he was able to taste several different single barrel selects. A sweet and light profile with just enough heat to tie it together.
4.5,"Neat. Crescent Springs almost 9 year old pick. Neck pour.  Oh that is creamy on the nose.  Rich caramel and milk chocolate.  Nice oak.  Ripe cherries. I’ll be honest, this may be the best Buffalo Trace nose I have come across.  It’s that milk chocolate creaminess I’m loving now.

Oilier than I was expecting.  Quite deeper on the tongue than I was expecting.  Brown sugar, cinnamon, oak cones through all over the tongue.  On the taste it starts out mint and straight into that chocolate again.  The caramel and oak come through on the finish and legs.

Such a great barrel pick.  Off memory, the best Buffalo Trace pick I have had.  Such a steal at $26!"
3.5,"Vanilla, honey, oak, balanced, quintessential bourbon with some brighter tones."

4.0,"Super sweet on the nose, I get tart apples, baking spices. I taste the oak, it's a subtle hint, not too overwhelming. The usual vanilla and caramel round out what was labeled ""Pie Crust"""
4.0,Very light and fruity. New GCM select barrel

4.25,"Single barrel pick for:
21(c) Museum Hotels, Kentucky (2018)

Nose: sweet caramel, butterscotch, cherries, vanilla, all the creamy dessert that Buffalo Trace fans crave, only brightened and enhanced 

Palate: vanilla cream, sweet tea, leather, hints of toffee and baking spices 

Finish: medium finish, with more vanilla and caramel with added spice

About as good of a BT Barrel Select as you’ll find. Quite rich, and highlights the best flavors Buffalo Trace has to offer."

3.5,"Reviewing a Single Barrel Selection by the ever reliable GCM Liqours. This one is barrel #63. They unfortunately did not receive age information on the barrel they purchased (why Buffalo Trace insists on withholding that on these is beyond me). 
Let's see if this one is better than the standard issue!
On the palate it's notes of caramel, butterscotch and brown sugar. Very classic Bourbon entry. Nuts and toasted oak lead the mid palate with nice balance. The finish is medium with pepper, leather and a hint of oak. 
All in all is a quite pleasant pour and much more robust and a little more complex than the batch product. 
Since I paid the same $ for this as I would have the batch product this is an easy purchase. 
I highly recommend these store pics if they are in the sub $30 range. You get a pretty old Bourbon (8-10 yrs old based on the notes I am getting), single barrel bottled at 90 proof from one of the great KY distilleries! 
However, don't pay over the odds. I have seen this priced close to $50 and it's a pass at the price point. 
GCM Liqours have once again picked a great barrel. Very classic easy sipper. I'll score this one a 3.5/5 and as always the price is factored in this score. 
Cheers all!"

4.0,"Linwood Liquors single barrel pick. Reminds me a lot of eht, but a little less heat. Definitely more complex with apple pie and cinnamon on the nose. Vanilla and brown sugar comes through with a warm cinnamon finish. A clear step up from standard bt."
4.5,Best $30 buy ever!
