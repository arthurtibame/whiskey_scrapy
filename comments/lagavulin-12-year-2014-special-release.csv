5.0,"The remaining couple drams of this bottle are locked away in a display case, as I shared a dram with Nick Offerman himself and had him sign the label."

4.5,"Nose: Pungent and very briny smoke. A sharp hit of citrus zest, mainly lemon, with a bracing oily background. There's a very sharp, strong medicinal note but it's not iodine - something more ""clinical"" than seashore. With water the nose softens considerably and develops some soft floral fruitiness.

Palate: Intensely dry and sweet at the same time - a huge alcohol sting, but not a burn. It's the zap of an intense cask-strength spirit that was run slowly through the still. Smooth, but with a knockout punch that leaves the lips quivering like after eating strong chilli. Lots of preserved lemons, bitter melon, grapefruit and seawater on a charcoal base. The palate is transformed with water, to become mellow, rounded and sweet. The intensity is dialed down but no more spice appears - instead the palate fills out and becomes restful and satisfying.

Finish: Medium-long, and dry. Somewhat herbal. Water again fills out the experience and changes the finale into a mildly sweet citrus event.

I'd been keeping this bottle for a while and finally opened it at the end of last year, along with the 8 year old, for a tasting of smokey whiskies with some friends. It almost renews my faith in Lagavulin. If you watered it down to 40% and added a big robust lapsang souchong tea smokiness to the developed palate then this would be like the 16 year old I remember from the 1990s.

Nose and taste it neat to start with, but then water it with a good hefty pour and let it sit for 15 minutes. As it develops it gains complexity but you need to give time for the released sweet oils to integrate with the forceful citrus notes. The smoke gains body and intensity, and becomes very pleasing. As a note to this, I have also tasted the 2015, 2016 and 2017 expressions, but only rushed at a tasting event so I've not reviewed them here.

What I can say, however, is that IMHO the 12 year old Special Editions have been getting better and better over time, which is a very encouraging sign. The 2017 is a great expression. I also looked up some of the critics' reviews for this one once I'd written mine, and found that Mr Broom scored it fairly low at Whisky Advocate, whilst Serge gave it 92. I'm with Serge.

""Excellent"" : 4.5 stars"
