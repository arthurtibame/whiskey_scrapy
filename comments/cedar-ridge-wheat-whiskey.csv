Yes it’s sweet, but has some fruit notes, mostly pear, to go with the toast, honey notes.  Not as one note as I expected.  Looking to add it to my bottle collection."

4.5,"Wow!!! If you are whiskey/whisky drinker who appreciates different styles, you MUST try this. I have had wheat whiskey and wheated bourbons before, but they are nothing like this. This is very unique and good. From the first whiff, and even more so in the mouth, this takes me back to my mother's kitchen; when it was filled with the aromas of fresh bread dough proofing near the heat of the stove, then being cut in small balls to form what will be fresh hot dinner rolls slathered in butter. All of that home-comfort is in each taste and swallow of this delightful whiskey. This is really a single MALTED wheat (not barley). That malting of the wheat must be the secret to this unique flavor. This is a soft, very tasty in a unique way, easy drinking whiskey. You may not love it, but you owe it to yourself to give it a try. Cedar Ridge appears to be an up and comer in their few years as a distillery, winning several awards and named Distillery of The Year in 2017. According to their web site the whiskey is available in 17 states, mostly the Midwest, deep south, NE, and west coast by looks of the map they show. Hope you can be lucky."

3.0,"Young tasting. Light, not much of the barrel. Yet, low alcohol burn."
3.0,Really light and polite. No burn or aftertaste to speak of. Just a bit of malty sweetness and floral notes on the nose.
