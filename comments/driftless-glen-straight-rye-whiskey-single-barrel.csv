4.0,"CBRC pick, “Luke’s unicorn siesta”, barrel 1792, 39 months, 100 proof.

Significantly better than my other barrel.  

Palette full of baking spices and rye bread, nice cinnamon finish. Unexpected notes of fresh apple and cherry.

Medium finish but full of flavor."
4.25,"the nose is primarily maple, piney spice and black tea with additional notes of eucalyptus, powdered sugar, fennel and oak. The palate is more black tea with eucalyptus, honey, rye spice, oak and white pepper. The finish is more black tea, honey, notes of grass and rye spice. Very enjoyable!"
