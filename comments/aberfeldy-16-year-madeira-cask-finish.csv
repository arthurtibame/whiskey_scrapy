4.25,"Aberfeldy is as fruity as it can be. The standard core range of 12, 18 and 21 are super fruity, as in fresh fruits. Apples and pears, your typical standard whisky. This expression, finished in madeira casks, gave it a twist... still fruity but tropical ones.

Bottled at 40%abv, golden color.

On the nose, amazing. Fruit salad, apples, pears, cinnamon, currants, pineapple, very tropical, like having a piña colada in a caribbean beach. 

On the palate, it gets more sweet in an artificial/sugary way, keeping some of the tropical fruitiness. Toffee, dulce de leche, oranges, pineapple and coconut.

Aftertaste is not as good, but still manages to pass the test. Coconut and hay. Coconut milk.

Overall this is a very refreshing, easy drinkable dram. Pretty nice actually. 89 over 100."
