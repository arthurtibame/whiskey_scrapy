I get a nutty oak upfront on the nose; walnut maybe, with alcohol fume seeping through if you take a deep breath. Taste is sweetened oak... Hint of cherry with Earthy undertones. Not as much burn as the nose lets on... Wonderful, lasting finish that just warms on the way down."

3.75,"Every once in a while a hyped limited release lives up to it's considerable hype! For background the Cream of Kentucky is a brand revival headed up by Jim Rutledge of Four Roses fame. The first 3 releases whilst no doubt very good Bourbons all fell a bit short of their expectations. This new batch goes a very long way to changing that perception, before we dive into the review let's dive into the components of this release:

Source: Undisclosed (rumoured to be Barton)
Mashbill: Undisclosed
Age: 13 yr old
Proof: 102 proof
Filtration: Chill filtered
Batch size: Approx 9,000 bottles and widely available in AZ currently

As you can see one of the major reservations with newer premium brands is the lack of transparency and over reliance on an individual's reputation to justify the purchase. Let's dive into the review:

Upon entry it's silky, if a bit light but packed with classic Bourbon notes. Rich toffee, burnt brown sugar and tobacco right up front. Vanilla, clove and wood spice on the mid palate. The finish is long and the oak is really felt as is the proof similar to a lot of well aged Bourbon. Leather and spice notes as well. It's really a quintessential mature Bourbon that is really well constructed. Whereas the other batches had some of the signature 1792 banana notes, that is a welcome subtraction this go around. 

If you liked the previous batches this batch is a strong recommendation. If you like mature no nonsense Bourbon profile, this is also a recommendation. If you want to be knocked off your feet, I would probably pass."
