3.5,Nice peach flavor.  Very little burn on the back end. Good to mix with some ice tea for a refreshing cocktail.

4.0,Got to evaluate this on what it is.  Not a sipping whiskey to drink neat. Drop some ice it or mix in a cocktail. Intense peach flavor with a little bite. If you like peaches you will love it.
4.0,"Sweet.  Powerful peach nose and flavor, with a slight bit of heat."
3.0,"Better than I thought. Sweet, lots of peach. Now time to reset my palette with some Ardbeg Kelpie"

5.0,Peaches... Fresh peaches with a little kick. Very smooth. Very drinkable on or off the rocks.
3.0,"$%#¥.

That was the sound I made when I realized I was buying this “whisky”. When my bourbon dealer recommended this bottle, I was horrified. And yes, I do think of him as a dealer, not a retailer, because he has this way of suggesting that something good will come my way in the near future when I buy crap like this from him on an off week. And it typically does, presumably because I typically do.

Still, I was horrified because I knew I had to buy it, and I hated most everything I saw on the label. 

“Flavored Whisky.” 
“Age: NAS.”
“Georgia peaches.”
“Canada.”

The nose: peaches.

The body: peaches. Why am I doing this.

The finish: bit of NyQuil. Oh, and peaches.

Disclaimer: this actually is pretty delicious. It’s some bullshit, but it’s tasty bullshit. I do like peaches. The fact that this $30 bottle comes with a felt bag inside a sealed box is pretty comical. But I dig it. I probably will try to cocktail this little guy and enjoy it quite a bit."

4.0,Actually enjoyed more than I thought alone it’s pretty sugary and smooth. Mixed with iced tea is great it adds a great peach flavor with out tasting  artificial compared to some schnapps that are overly sugary and artificial flavored. But my opinion
4.5,damn that's real cool
4.5,Peachy without being to sweet like the maple.

3.5,"Sweet sweet and more sweet. I find it to be quite good, but not necessarily as a neat sipper. Got to get creative with this one. On the rocks, splash of sprite, mixer in a cocktail. This is a great drink for spring and summer when outside relaxing not wanting anything too harsh."
4.5,The gold standard of flavored spirits as far as I’m concerned

5.0,Peach flavor is strong and authentic. Whisky has a subtle burn on the finish. Is syrupy out of the bottle. Pour over spherical ice and let ice melt a bit to cut.

3.5,I absolutely love when this is in season in the spring time. Your typical crown front end with a smooth sweet peach finish. Great after dinner dessert treat.

3.5,Good mix drink that’s about it. Throw it in some sweet tea and your golden
5.0,OMG what a smooth drink.
2.75,"Accomplishes what it sets out to do.  Tasty, especially mixed.  Don't head in to it expecting a serious whiskey.  Come on, it's 70 proof and flavored, don't be such a try-hard looking for 'notes of toasted almonds on a crisp September afternoon' or whatever. That's clearly not the point here.  It's sweet and fruity, and you can taste a tiny bit of whiskey shining through.  Throw it in a mixed drink and head out to the pool.  A little on the pricey side give it was a special release, but I'd say it's worth it for the novelty and taste."
4.0,"Smells very artificial (obviously) on the nose, but the taste is enough that the none whiskey drinkers in my family finished a bottle with me rather quickly."
3.5,Very peachy and slightly sweet-bitter.. easily the best flavored crown product I’ve tasted.
4.0,BEST with Lipton Peach Tea! My favorite summer time drink!
2.0,The nose is incredible and that is where it ends.  Rough neat or with a bit of ice.  So sweet.  It will be a solid mixer with iced tea or lemonade but ill never do this solo again.

4.0,I am not a fan of flavored whiskeys but I love peach so I had to try it. The smell is all peach and very delightful.  Excellent peach taste but quite sweet. Probably an excellent mixer.
