3.75,"The smell, as expected, reveals the peaty and marine soul of the whisky, with barbecue smoke and salt. The smoke is actually quite light, leaving plenty of room for fruity notes with lemon zest and a spicy touch.
The palate becomes more fleshy and hard, very ashy, with the marine soul to act as a counterpart together with citrus and cloves. Smoking tends to prevail, offering very little evolution.
The finish is medium long, of used ashtray, salt and orange.
Wanting to represent Islay, obviously, they chose the simplest and most direct route, with a whisky full of smoke and seaworthiness that pushes on the two most characteristic aspects without giving much else.
On the other hand, for such an economic and at the same time ""limited"" edition, we could not have expected much more.
Of course, at this point for the same price it is better to take one of the base malts of the blend..."

2.5,"Somewhat more complex on the mouth than regular JW Black Label, but as good compared to single malts such as Lagavulin by itself"
2.5,"Smokey but flavor is very flat. There's nothing much outside of the smoke. Much rather go with other Islay single malts than this JW experiment, especially for the price."
2.5,Smoke and not much else. Better with ice. Better choices out there for the price.
3.5,Smokey peat on the nose and no Suprise’s on the taste. Incredibly smooth without much flavor after the peat.
3.0,Sweet Smokiness. Truthfully not my favorite
