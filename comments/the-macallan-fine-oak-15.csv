3.0,79. Everything about this scotch is nice. Nice nose. Mild w a slight kick. Tasty. But...unexciting. I won't turn down an offer for a dram and would drink it over other choices...but it won't be on my preferred list.
3.0,Disappointed for the price point. Actually like the 12 better.

4.0,"The Macallan 15 is a great choice when it comes to The Macallan family. It comes with a ""woody"" smell that makes your nose dive into old ages. Its crisp and at the same time sort of mellow. Its nice. 
Yet the 15 y old whisky is lowcomming when it comes to its 12 and 18y old brothers but it still has a caracther of its own. I like the version that comes bottled from sherry casks from Jerez, Spain better but still ita not a bad option. The macallan family never disappints but go for the 18y if you're willing to pay that sort of cash."

3.0,"Very earthy.  Fine is oak is right.  Unlike the 12 this one is not strong on the sherry, hence it tastes less fruity and more spicy.  The nose is rather medicinal and doesn't give much insight as to what you are about to drink.  I personally don't think it's worth the hefty price tag.  Worth a try though."

Finishes dry and oaky with a touch of spice, though may sound harsh is actually quite pleasant.  Give this one time, work it slowly and it improves and sweetens out. No water necessary.  I found this one rather pleasant once it truly opened. [86/100][Tasted 10/15/14; 4/9/16]"

3.0,"The first work of the bees in springtime, aromatic and floral, peach blossoms, freshly peeled Minneola orange, sweet apple... and that's just the nose. A longer draw and you sense its richer aromas, like maple syrup and cocoa. I taste peaches, spiced cider, baking chocolate, honeysuckle, and this all supported by a lovely oak flavor that brings depth but delicacy. This dram sports an all-present body and an enlightening, revitalizing mouthfeel. The finish is spicy, on the dry side, and full of a dozen other niceties, like menthol and lightly sweetened strawberries. All-in-all: delicate, peach, oak, sophisticated. Fine oak indeed. Update: this whisky was great but only deserves three stars for the value. Typical Macallan, it would seem, in that it's overpriced compared to what other distillers offer for similar bottlings."

4.0,"To be a triple oak barrel blend there is a surprising absence of wood on the nose.  There's lots of sweet fruit and flowers with just a hint of oak and sherry cask.  The oak waits until it rolls across your tongue, then it makes a big presence- vanilla and heavy spice.  Just a tiny bit of raisiny sweetness before finishing pretty smooth like almost every Mac I've had.

My notes lead me to believe the 15 is marginally better than the 10, and I wanna say the price point was only $20-30 more than the entry level of the fine oak series (the 15 was $70 IIRC).  Unfortunately I don't have any 10 year laying around to do a proper side by side, but I'm pretty sure the 15 would win and be the one I'd recommend.

I always recommend Macallan because they are the pinnacle of Highland/Speyside scotches IMO.  Sadly, they know it and are almost always significantly more expensive than most of their neighbors.  A lot of times though they really are worth it.  Cheers."

I honestly can't recall ones I've had a week or two back, but there are my top 5 that I'll remember 25 years later.  Those top 5 are experiences that you'll remember for decades.  For me, it's been a Brora 30, High West Midwinter, Yamazaki 18, Hibiki 21, and now this Macallan 15 Fine Oak.  I need to get a full bottle of this one.  Thanks to Davie---not for just a sample, but for one that I'll remember for years to come.  The aroma is vanilla and freshly cut oak.   Taste follows through nicely with brown sugar, honey, oranges.  Really take small sips, you'll savor it more that way.  I had it with a small round ice.  Bought out more chocolate flavors.  Finish is back to the fresh cut oak and orange peels.  Definitely need to pick up a full bottle."
5.0,"50th Note! Undeniably Macallan, but on a new and different plane. The nose is rich, intense and humming with floral honey and woody spices. With water and time to open, a glorious suffusion of macadamia nuts and warm vanilla, along with a wonderful undercurrent of malt chocolate. Hint of distant smoke. On the palate it's full, with zesty orange peel and candied ginger. The finish starts with cinnamon sugar, then finds a very old, stalwart piece of good oak and sands it. One of the very best bottles I've ever had... I may have to defenestrate my entire rating scale. Dry glass: Chocolate covered strawberries!"

This dram reminds me of a Broadway show using the same cast for 15 years. Capable? Absolutely. Talented? No doubt. Provide entertainment? Sure. Passion and soul within that performance? That’s where this one seems to get lost. 

It just seems kind of soulless. That’s disappointing from a scotch of this caliber.

The elements are there. On the nose, rich vanilla with subtle citrus, dried fruits and candied notes. It’s smooth on entry with a medium mouth feel. However, that smooth entry morphs into a bolder heat that is simultaneously calming and harsh at times.

This scotch isn’t terrible. In fact, what’s here, makes for some fun discussion. Sadly, it feels like this one is phoning it in or distracted and that keeps it from reaching its full potential. This leaves you feeling short changed for the price of admission.

3.0,"This review is about 10 months old that I posted on the Barreled app before I met all you fine people. Sample was from Lee 

This Macallan is 43% ABV and is aged in a combination of ex bourbon and sherry casks. I do not know if this is chill filtered or not. It is a brilliant yellow gold in color, but I'm not sure if it is natural color or not. 

The nose has an initial blast of strong oak. It develops into raisins and orange peel. Dried fruits and sherried fruits are there. There are strong floral notes as well. More oak and some vanilla. I think the best word to use to describe the nose is sharp. Not an unpleasant sharp, but it definitely cuts through your senses. The oak dominates everything else. 

The palate is pretty light, again with the oak in the foreground. Orange oil and some sherry sweetness. There is some nuttiness in the background. 

What really surprised me was the mouthfeel. Lightly oily and it coats the mouth. This carries into the finish. This one sticks around for a while with the oiliness just leaving you wondering how long it will last. In a good way. 

Overall this is a quality scotch, but it seems like it's relying more on the Macallan name to warrant its price rather than its intrinsic qualities. I was expecting more from this and I have to say I'm scratching my head as to why Macallan has as high of a reputation as it does. I did a side by side with the 17 YO fine oak. I think I prefer the 17 overall, but the mouthfeel on this one wins between the two. Given that the quality of the oak is the selling point of the fine oak series I grabbed my bottle of Glenlivet 15 French oak reserve to compare. I have to say the Glenlivet had a warmer nose and smoother, fruitier palate. All for half the price of the Macallan 15. 3.25"

This reminds me of a softer  Glenmorangie 10 year with a touch of vanilla... over priced for me.

4.0,"This review has been transferred over from the Barreled App.  I reviewed this way back in Sept of 2016:


It seems like it's been a couple of months since I had a bottle of Macallan open.  I finished the 10 year Fine Oak back in April/May of 2016 and immediately went out and bought the 15, 17 & 21 year versions because I enjoyed the youngest so much.  I had to look back at my notes and reviews to see if I remembered any specific thoughts I wanted to compare with its older siblings.

To be a triple oak barrel blend there is a surprising absence of wood on the nose.  There's lots of sweet fruit and flowers with just a hint of oak and sherry cask.  The oak waits until it rolls across your tongue, then it makes a big presence- vanilla and heavy spice.  Just a tiny bit of raisiny sweetness before finishing pretty smooth like almost every Mac I've had.

My notes lead me to believe the 15 is marginally better than the 10, and I wanna say the price point was only $20-30 more than the entry level of the fine oak series (the 15 was $70 IIRC).  Unfortunately I don't have any 10 year laying around to do a proper side by side, but I'm pretty sure the 15 would win and be the one I'd recommend.  I still have the 17 and 21 year on hand, so I think things are only gonna get better.

I always recommend Macallan because they are the pinnacle of Highland/Speyside scotches IMO.  Sadly, they know it and are almost always significantly more expensive than most of their neighbors.  A lot of times though they really are worth it.  This is easily a 4 star dram.  Cheers."

Notes: Very fine sherry aged scotch more on the spice side. Oak and spice dominate the finish. The dark fruit that I normally associate with sherry is not as dominate, but is present. Very solid dram, and delicious on the nose. The price has gone up since I purchased this bottle, and would not buy at the new price."

4.0,"Happy 4th of July! To celebrate, I cracked open a #MacallanFineOak15 for a solo #whiskyreview. This bottle was matured for 15 years in 3 casks: European #sherry oak, American sherry oak, and American #bourbon oak barrels.
....…......….…...........................................................................
Nose: There’a a delightful floral scent with vanilla, lemon, honey, and a hint of green grapes. 90/100
....…......….…...........................................................................
Palate: It’s a smooth dram with a chewy texture. Flavors of vanilla, honey, and orange permeate your mouth with spice and dried oak in the background. 91/100
....…......….…...........................................................................
Finish: The dram ends nicely with a sweet, floral, and slightly spicy finish of medium length. 88/100
....…......….…...........................................................................
Overall Experience: It’s a fantastic dram and I give it an overall score of 90/100.
....…......….…...........................................................................
Value for Money: I found this bottle for $100 USD in June 2018, but many stores sell this for north of $120 due to the worldwide popularity of The Macallan brand. It’s a bit expensive, but I think there may be some exclusivity for this bottle in the near future as Macallan is moving towards non-age statement expressions.

3.25,"Very light color for 15 years and sherry casking.  Seems to be more influence from the bourbon barrel, likely not first fill, or at least a dry/fino type sherry.

Dry.  Crisp.  Lemon.  A bit of black pepper.  Cocoa notes - but not chocolate... no cream.  A hint of vanilla extract - again, just the essence, does not deliver the richness of a finished baked good with the sweet and fat alongside it.

Overall, not that impressed.  Generally, the flavors just don’t seem to go together.  Perhaps judged unfairly side by side with a much richer, sweeter scotch.  This one may be better standalone given its light finesse."

4.0,"My wife’s son bought this for me for Christmas. He was the only one of my family and friends who bought me whisky for Christmas. He gets me!

I know Macallan gets a bit of a bad rap for being overpriced and maybe deservedly so. This bottle averages $105 online, a bit over my normal price range. The Macallan 12 yr was one of the first scotches I tried that I really liked and this one is very good as well, so maybe their prices aren’t completely out of line. But on to the tasting. 

This dram is aged for 15 years and matured in three types of casks: ex-bourbon, European ex-sherry, and American ex-sherry. It’s bottled at 43% ABV and is a nice natural color of dark straw. It produces nice long legs when given a spin in the Glencairn. 

The nose is floral barley and sweet sherry: berries, honey, oranges, and chocolate. The American oak and bourbon cask shows up in vanilla notes. Really enjoyable. I like this better than the big sherry bomb style like Glendronach.

In the mouth its classic malted barley, sweet honey, vanilla, hints of chocolate and cinnamon. A slightly thick mouthfeel, it also has a bit more heat than I would expect for a 43% 15 yr old. That’s not all bad, just a little unexpected. 

The finish is decently long with warm oak and spice, dried fruit. It hangs around just long enough to make you want another sip. 

Overall I really like this whisky. Would I put out $105-110 to buy a bottle? I don’t know, but I’m grateful that I have the opportunity to enjoy it. 4/5."
4.0,"I had the good fortune of sampling this one very early in my whisky drinking days. At that time, this stood out as a sort of gold standard for Scotch. Fast forward a couple years and exposure to a host of comparable options, and I’ve got a bottle at my disposal to put this highly-touted malt to the test.
Nose: Very sweet. Heavy honey and floral notes. A tad oily. There is also orange and citrus. White grape that is reminiscent of white wine.  I’m no expert here, but it reminds me a bit of a Sauvignon Blanc. Sherry is detectable but for less than in any other Macallan I’ve had. Some oak spice in the background. 
Palate: Initially it is very creamy and buttery; however, it quickly becomes dry. The orange and citrus are still present, now accompanied by plum, raisin, and vanilla. True to its name, oak is prominent throughout. White grape is still present in the background. In all, I’d say the palate is moderately rich. Upon pouring a second glass, I detect some chocolate in the background.
Finish: This is the highlight of the Macallan 15. Here, the whisky best delivers on the promise displayed on the packaging. The finish begins with orange zest and rich milk chocolate before a sharp but welcome transition into oak spice and cinnamon in what amounts to a moderate-to-long finish.
With hindsight, I can understand why I thought so highly of this one. I still do. It is above average at every turn and boasts a superb finish that makes a lasting impression. It certainly is well-balanced. It is rich and complex and so I have no complaints with this one. I will say that it is a bit overpriced at $100. Furthermore, it does not truly excel until the finish.
Upon weighing its pros and cons, I still feel that this one is worth its salt. At its worst, it is above average. At its best, it lives up to the distinction that one would expect from a name like Macallan. Just a damn good drink. At this point in my journey, it is no longer an exception to the rule. But its balance and rich complexity have earned this one a respectable four stars."

Bottled at 40%abv

On the nose is amazing: fresh lemon peel and lemon pie. Vanilla plant and Honey. Its aroma is super nice, well made. 

On the palate is amazing. There is this macallan typical profile but much more peppery. Dry grass notes too. DELCIOUS.

Finish is short but pleasant, this is where it lost some points. This is a very delicious and balanced dram, that is why i give it a 91 over 100."

The Macallan orange notes are turned up slightly, and while sweet, the sweetness is more of a simplistic barley I'd expect in cheaper drams.  The vanilla does not mate well with the tangy sweetness.  The finish is spicier than either the 12 or the 18, and it retains the Macallan mild smokiness."
