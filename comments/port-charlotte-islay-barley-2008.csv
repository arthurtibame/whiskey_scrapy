3.25,"Distilled from 100% Islay sourced barley from six different farms.  Peated to 40ppm.  Non-chill filtered and no color added.

N:  Very salty with bandaids and phenol counterpunching, hints of lemon, vanilla, biscuits, pine needles.

P:  Smoked oily peaty peanut butter on biscuits with salt and pepper with some lemon on the side.

F: Black pepper, burnt oak, and a briny and oily mouth feel.  Leaves an astringent and drying finish.

Salty on the nose while medicinal/phenolic and peaty.  Some fruit notes peek through, but are not on the forefront.  Salty and drying throughout.  It makes me thirsty for water, actually.  I’m not really a fan of this, mainly because of the bold astringency, especially on the finish.  I see this has several good reviews on here, but it didn’t go that way for me.  This review is based off of an entire bottle.  I spent quite a bit of time with it.  I even let it set less than half full for a few months.  I actually thought that it improved a little after that, but not significantly.  Cheers!"

4.75,"Peat smoke from start to finish.  Right when you think that you've got all the smoke, you get hit with more smoke, and then more, and more.  Dry, smokey, very salty finish.  I was expecting this to be good, but it blew past my expectations.  This is virtually perfect."
