2.0,"The distillate source for this bottle changed during its existence as a brand and as a result the quality can greatly vary.  Find a good bottle and it’s a 95+ point whiskey that could change your life...get the bad one and you’ll be kicking yourself for spending $600-700 on it as you pour it down the drain.

I highly recommend just drinking this at a bar or splitting the risk with a few friends."
