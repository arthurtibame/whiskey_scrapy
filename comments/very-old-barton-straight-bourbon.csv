3.0,"Another one that--based on the $13 pricetag--is so much better than you'd expect it to be. Again, not setting the world on fire, but enough flavour and enough interesting stuff going on to make it a decent purcahse. Big caramel-custard flavours (that I get in a lot of Barton whiskeys), boozy, Werther's candy, milky, slate/stone/limestone?, candied vanilla, corn husk. More spice on the taste than the nose--big cinnamon, clove, ginger. Chocolate, bitter orange. Not bad."

3.0,"Not quite sure what classifies the difference between ""old"" and ""very old"" but  it seems to be pretty irrelevant on bourbons that carry no age statement. This is an easy drinker and easily one of the best quality to value bourbons on the market. At  $15 for a 750ml, it's worth a chance. At the very least you can drink it with an old friend or if you choose to stay on theme, with a very old one."

4.0,"BiB 100-proof version. Some musk, maybe some honey, on the nose. Surprisingly, has a familiar wheater bourbon taste, akin to Weller Special Reserve, although this has no wheat. Pleasantly sweet and spicy, just the right amount of both. Bitter chocolate at the end. Adding a limestone water ice cube brings out some caramel notes. A bit more creamy or vanilla notes would make this incredible, but for $15 this is fantastic, so hard to complain. 2/11/17
    A bit more walnut this time around. Still very good. 3/11/17
  Revisiting this after a few months, and it does not disappoint. Smells perfumy and sticky sweet. On the tongue, feels a little thin, although it seems to have a gritty almost sandy texture. The proof provides this with ample heat and flavor. I get pepper, furniture polish, nuts, and bitter chocolate. This has to be one of the best bourbons, if not the best, you can get for under $15. 5/15/17"

Smooth, cinnamon redhots on the middle of the tongue,  a nice warmth that fills the chest.  Tasty dram for an economical price.  Though not as complex or flavorful as Old GrandDad BiB it still is a very good choice for a nightly dram."

        Nose:  faint sweet vanillins and caramels, really not much, but what there is says ""BOURBON""
        
        On palate: spice rye, some banana nut rye, dry ryes, peppers,  light sweet crude faint dark dank sugars, certianly a tastey concoction.   A notable mustiness of chinese cinnamon fading into a barn door oak, some might find this off putting, to others this is ""home"", but either way it is there and is notable.  I find it a somewhat charming spin on the aged oak variant and given the remainder is pretty much all good in the peppered spiced rye area it's unbelieavable that more folks aren't ""on to"" this bottle and over look it due to the almost absurdly low cost.  But hey let's keep that to ourselves!  FInish, goes down smooth, small warm lingering low cinnamon spice and a very notable LACK of harshness on the backside. Literally nothing to turn you away from seconds.  Enjoy this bargain basement bourbon and just laugh when some snob tells you a good bottle starts at 80$$.. 
    easily a 3 star value and possible more

Probably wouldn't win many blind tastings, but definitely punches above its weight class.  There's no apologizing for this in your cabinet.

Easy drinker..Honeysuckle, apple nose. Slightly sweet, Beam-like nuttiness, cinnamon on the tongue..very slight bubblegum.  In the same flavor family as Beam High Rye (Basil Hayden, OGD).  I doubt many would notice if you filled an empty Basil bottle with this

3.5 for taste, 5 for value.  Somewhat hard to find due to its cult status.  Crazy that a 13 dollar bottle is behind glass and limited to 1/person."
3.0,"This is the 86 proof version available in NC.  Fairly good.  A bit too much alcohol on the nose, and in the mouth. Not very complex, but no off notes or rot-gut flavors.

Overall... This is a true bust. Nothing special at all. The nuance is lost behind the proof which is a shame since that isnt necessary. Plenty of high proof have flavor and complexity. This is just standard whiskey, and sure it has some decent flavors, in general though it's only a $20 and under at most. Anything above $20 is a scam.

3.75,"Nose:  Ethanol and herbal notes on the immediate nosing - mint, fresh grass, anise, and more spice from the rye in there.  Not overly sweet, which I like, but what's there is more like dark toffee and butterscotch.

Palate:  Much sweeter on the taste than the nose implies.  Nice and spicy with lots of cinnamon, pepper, allspice, oak.    Corn dust and graham cracker are a base for all the herbs and spices in there along with some vanilla pudding.  There's a bit of waxy bitterness in there that's a little off-putting. 

Finish: Long and warming.  The finish is all spices, and cream.  Absolutely identical to chocolate eclairs!

Conclusion:  For a $14 bottle, this can't be beat.  Honestly, this outclasses most bourbons up to the $40 range.  I bought this as a bottle to bring camping, cheap and easy, but I had no idea it would be this good!  The only complaint I could give would be that odd walnut/waxy bitter note in there that doesn't really meld with the rest of it.  For the price, this is one I will keep stocked at all times!"

3.25,"I’ve had the 86 proof and was excited to find what I thought was the Bottled In Bond version that’s seemed to have disappeared. Well it’s back, sort of. No more Bottled In Bond marking, just 100 proof.

On the nose I get dusty charred rye, black pepper and vanilla. The sort of classic Barton/1792 nose.  I get more freshly baked bread (yeast) on later nosings.

The palate has charred oak, vanilla, that dusty rye and some slight bitterness.

The finish is on the long side of short. Some rye and oak poke out at the beginning and then it ends with a slight tingle and some sweet vanilla.

Not bad. Definitely more full bodied than the 86 proof version, that one seems almost watered down in comparison. Though the 1792 Single Barrel that I have is marginally better than this 100 proof Very Old Barton. Which I think is a reason why people see so much value in this one. At about 1/3 of the cost, it’s gets you fairly close."

4.5,"A while back some friends and I got together to taste whiskeys and talk about them. I brought over my bottle of Very Old Barton 80 proof and it was well-received by everyone. A week or so later I get a text from one of the guys there asking if I wanted a different Barton product and he sent me a picture of the wonderful surprise. For $30 for a half-gallon bottle. The bottle itself is big and heavy enough to go bear hunting with. The Bourbon inside is simply amazing. The juice compares very favorably to Henry McKenna BiB and if you can find it is a fraction of the price. The nose is vanilla and caramel and a little bit of wood. As you sip it the flavor lingers in your mouth for a nice while with the flavors lingering well between sips. With water or ice, this mellows very nicely and becomes a great evening drink. This also makes an outstanding Old Fashioned and Manhattan with the flavors of the Bourbon mixing well. Please remember this is 100 proof and don't drink this on an empty stomach as I did and I had to take a nap before supper. I can't recommend this highly enough if you can find this and you are a Bourbon fan this is an outstanding drink for you."

3.25,"1.5L First time try, on ice. Bold, spicey, creamed-corn, barrel char and subtle seeetness w a long finish. Not complex, and not bad!"
4.0,"Tremendous value until they discontinued the bottled in bond version of this. A fantastic rye-heavy bourbon mash that most whiskey lovers could appreciate. 

Nose: banana nut bread, corn, oak, butterscotch 

Palate: quite rich for such an inexpensive bourbon (probably why they pulled it, so they can release later at a higher price point)... balances mix of light fruits, mint, tea, maple syrup, orange citrus and vanilla 

Finish: pretty short, but there’s an extra kick of cinnamon in there"

3.0,"Carmel and oak on the nose. Heavy woodsy smell with a burn anticipation before the first sip. Soft vanilla and caramel with light tobacco. First sip is burn followed by burn all the way down. An ice cube doesn’t cut the rye, just seems to bring out more spice. A decent pour for the price, but I’d rather spend a few bucks more and get something more palatable."

3.75,"On the noise I get bubble gum, baking spices, corn sweetness.

On the palate I get caramel, apple and some raspberry, like a prominent red fruit, rye spice.

I get a medium finish for how thin the body of it is. Some grainy notes at the end. But for $15, this is great!"

3.0,"Dark golden/light amber color
Nose shows some rye, spice and a nice pop of heat.
Smooth mouthfeel, Sweet on the front transitions nicely into corn, burnt caramel and a hint of vanilla.
Nothing really jumps out of the glass, but it's well balanced and easy to drink neat.
Freshly hewn oak comes through on the finish with some dry cereal grains.
For 14 bucks a bottle, this is a true bargain. Isn't going to blow your hair back, but it's very drinkable neat."

4.0,Sweet with small bite at end.  Smooth for a 100
2.75,"Nose - oak, vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, nutmeg, peanut butter, banana, moderate/high ethanol burn. 

Taste - dusty corn sweetness, oak notes, caramel, vanilla, mild banana, maple syrup, subtle rye spice, young/bright alcohol bite, finishing medium-length and lingering brown sugar, peanut, and ethanol flavors.

Unremarkable, but a solid value for under $20 a bottle. It also mixes well with Coke."
