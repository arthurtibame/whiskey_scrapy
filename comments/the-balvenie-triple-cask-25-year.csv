1.75,"Oh my god, this one must be a dud. It cant be THAT bad. It is plain water. I hope this was a bad batch, because this goes around for $520, and it would definitively be a shame if you spend this much money and get this ""nothingness"" of a dram.

Bottled at 40%abv. 

On the nose, sparkling water, soda water cookies, malty, foam, acetone. Nothing at all. 

On the palate, its oaky i guess, WATER, nothing and chocolate. Yes, nothing is a note here. Lol.

Zero aftertaste.

Ok... the score for this is.... 34 over 100. And, i think i gave it a high score. Run. Run from it."
