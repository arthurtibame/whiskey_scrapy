4.25,A bit different but really surprisingly good.  Claims to be 10 yrs old. Also have a blended Bourbon with 4 and 10 yr old. Bit high $$$ for me on the regular basis.

5.0,Holy shit this one is good.  Good neat and good over ice.  It's not overly sweet but I get a bit of a sweet taste.

3.5,"Color is dark amber, almost copper. Nose starts with leather, oak, and vanilla. Swirling reveals subtle toffee and baking spices. First sip is dark, with lots of baking spices as well a notes of brown sugar. Mouthfeel is not thin, but does have a little drying sensation. Additional sips show notes of toffee and vanilla. Finish is moderate, with more of the baking spices.

Overall, a solid if not overly exciting Bourbon. Probably not worth the $50 tag, but no other significant complaints."
