2.5,"Difficult to perceive the aroma, after a long while resting you get a very creamy aroma. Nevertheless, after adding water and let the alcohol evaporate a bit, you'll find some toffee in there. When you taste it, at the beggining is sweet, like corn or syrup, then you get a bitter finish, but is very short. It is actually not a bad whisky, but is more hype than flavor for all the Beckham sponsorship of it."

2.0,It is harsh at first. It gets better the longer the bottle is open. It's definitely sweet. I think I may be a barley snob. Most of my higher ratings have gone to 100% barley mashes. I don't think I'd buy a second bottle.

Very harsh, tasteless, and undesirable (the scotch, not the girl haha). Wish I had just drank the apple juice in her fridge instead..."
4.0,"Got my 1st bottle in a ""Duty-Free"" at the airport. I now am on my 3rd bottle.  I am a Bourbon drinker, but , love this Scotch. The wheat gives it a much smoother finish.  A great ""go-to"" Scotch for my visitors who want to experience something different."

4.0,Can taste the vanilla and has a sweet taste. The smell is more or a carmel or butterscotch. The longer it sits open the smoother it gets

1.0,"Rather than piling on I'll offer a suggestion for how to use this:  mix it 3:1:1 with Cointreau and amaretto, serve up with an orange rind to garnish.  It produces a fine cocktail.  I agree it's not a sipping whisky (perhaps not even a whisky at all).  But if it's on discount (and I got it at a pretty steep discount that brought it down to around $30), it's a fair mixer!

Here's another odd scent note:  when I poured a little of this and had it with a cigar, the aroma was a dead ringer for chocolate ice cream, so much so that it was a little eerie.  So there is some nice quality hiding in this scotch, and I'd be intrigued to try a version that is aged a little longer and not rolled out to the market with this over-the-top, Beckham-fueled marketing hype."

2.0,"Never having had a single grain, I approached this sample from my gift set with mild interest, but reading that it is made mostly from wheat set my expectations fairly low. I knew it likely wouldn't compare well to a single malt, and it didn't. It also didn't have a character anywhere close to a wheated bourbon, despite being aged in ex-bourbon barrels. 

Very light and thin looking in the glass, with no legs on swirling. The nose yielded honey and apple cider with a faint hint of citrus and vanilla. On the palate, it was honey sweet with a flavor akin to eating a biscuit with a cup of black tea. Very light with a thin mouth feel. A little bitter on the finish, which was very short. 

In all, very light (some might say ""smooth"") and inoffensive. Also, just not that interesting. I looked it up and saw that it can be purchased in my area for US $59.99.  I can think of much better uses for 60 bucks, as there are many good single malts, bourbons and ryes to be had for that."

3.0,"A Sweet and light (maybe too light) whiskey. Its an ok option, but lacks depth"
2.0,"Nose is honey, bit of butter. 

Palate is honey, butter, hint of spice, like white pepper. For a single grain, it's interesting, but the weak body & relatively quick finish leave me wanting some depth."

2.0,Tastes like a devils cut smoothed and watered down. The bite is not there. Very light.
1.0,This is undrinkable. Seriously. To call this scotch is an insult. Please don't waste your money. David Beckham should be ashamed.
2.0,"Presented in an over-sized cologne bottle. Nose opens alarmingly sweet and buttery, with pronounced acetone and magic marker. Some rice wine swirling beneath the chemical layers, and a hint of burning nitrile rubber. Palate is all cheap honey, sweet, grainy and slightly sour. Abrubt yet gentle enough finish, something like plywood resin lingers. An ""interesting"" dram (in a rather bad way). Sampled at a casual tasting party, someone received this as a gift, via store-clerk recommendation (never, ever listen to the store-clerk). Pure marketing fodder for the uninformed masses. Dry glass: almost nothing! Very strange..."

2.0,Not great at all. Somewhat bland. Fortunately I didn't pay as it was given/handed to me and being polite I accepted. I read somewhere recently that it tastes as you'd imagine David Beckham smelling like. Not entirely sure that's a compliment to Mr Beckham.
2.0,"Grain whisky - I drank it rocked as offered by a mate. Different flavour, liked the vanilla in there, kind of refreshing but a bit flat too - probably wouldn't go this one neat. The second star is for the bottle!"
2.0,"Surprisingly decent. There's a bit of a burn in the finish, and that takes away from the overall pleasure of this whisky, but both the nose and palate are pleasing. Imagine sweet breakfast cereal without the milk."

4.0,"First, we need to understand this is not a Malt.
Consistant comparison with Malts is pointless.
The texture is very pleasant, aromas of vanilla pastry & butter are here, but leave more room to lighter floral, herbal (not brine or peat grass !) and fresh fruit.
A great option for easy sipping, adding ice, or a beautiful Rob Roy."

2.5,"Not ""Scotch,"" not ""blended Scotch,"" but rather a good quality grain whisky that usually would be used in blending. It is smooth and has butterscotch overtones---and that is it. It is bottled in an impressive blue decanter style bottle to put on a good show, but show is all it is. When first released in my area of midwest USA most stores were pricing it at $60-$80 a bottle. Now they are clearing them out at $19-$25 a bottle. If you don't like whisky, but feel compelled to drink some for some reason, this may be for you. Go stand next to that apple-pie vodka swilling teenager!"

1.5,"This is one of those bottles that some one buys you and says “oh, I thought you’d like this” and you smile, and say thank you...then you drink it and realize you need friends with better taste. This is junk, a thin cheap grain spirit that’s been flavored, it’s terrible, barely worthy of a mixer. Save your money"
