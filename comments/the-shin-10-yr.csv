4.25,"For this week's Whisky Sleeper we delve into the murky world of Japanese Whisky... As we have discussed a few times Japanese Whisky has very loose guidelines and requirements and thus it's hard to trust new brands in the market place... This was an occasion where I found one with a double digit age statement, high ABV,100% malt whisky for a sub $70 price point.... Let's dive in....

It enters very rich with vanilla, honey, orange peel and apples leading...mid palate the Miz oak is dominant with a some cocoa and a mocha note... Finish is Miz oak driven with a hint of smoke.. A rich and surprisingly good dram. 

I compared this to the Nikka FTB and honestly, this was richer and more satisfying despite the lower ABV... Whilst it no doubt contains a good amount of Scottish single malt this blend is all Japanese on the palate... I originally was looking for a Nikka FTB alternative... I think this one actually stands tall next to it, and it's readily available... For now!

Cheers all and stay safe!"
