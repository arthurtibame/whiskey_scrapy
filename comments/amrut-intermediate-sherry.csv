4.0,"Excellent whisky. Not peaty or smoky, but more refreshing with the unmistakable sherry cask influence. Definitely dry fruits."
5.0,Had the Amrut single cask px-sherry. A brilliant whisky.

5.0,"This is really unique whiskey.   Those guys in Bangalore really got creative and turned the notion of cask finishing upside down.   It's a pretty complex maturation.  They first matured in bourbon casks, then shipped the spirit to Spain (why?!?  seems more expensive...but, maybe to avoid contamination).  Then the spirit was matured in sherry cask, on site in Spain.  It was shipped back to Bangalore, India.  Then matured in bourbon again.   So...was this all worth it?  In my humble opinion...YES.  Nose is red fruits, like raspberry and strawberries.  Taste doesn't let down...it's more of candy fruit and that house flavor of Amrut---licorice.  And the finish is spicy cardamon and ginger...I almost felt as if I was  having the typical chai we make at home every morning.   This is really well made, and they went the distance in a complex maturing scheme.   It also doesn't show it's youth.  Maybe because the climate in Bangalore is close to 100 degrees all year, and maturation is faster.  This feels more like a 15 year old.   Highly recommended!"

4.0,The alcohol strength comes out in the nose and this is a strong complex whiskey. After a few drops it mellows down and is very enjoyable .

5.0,"Excellent sherry bomb done right.  Good quality casks, barrell strength, good value for money.  Tasty and complex.  A worthy investment that can hang with some of the best scotches."
5.0,The nose doesn't show how lovely this whisky tastes full of dried fruits. The finish is sweet and warming with sweet oak lingering on the back palate for ages.  Yuuuumm

4.25,"I need to figure out if I need more of this before it's gone.  

Nose - There is just something about Amrut. It's dusty, it's oakey, it's sweet, but there's something so complex and different.  Sherry notes are here but they're just up front.  The mid and finish are all about this oak that's been roasted, spice I can't figure out, and malt that makes no sense.  I get some vanilla, some oak spice, a hint of cherry with sherry notes, 

Taste - super oakey and spicey with vanilla, charred black oak notes, toasted barrel, some chocolate, and you know I don't normally spell this out but there's a huge amount of European oak.  

I need another bottle of this badly.  So badly."

3.75,Indian. Like a glenfiddich 18 only a little hard/strong. Enjoyable sherry but not a daily driver . Smoky bourbon finish. Sherry butts and oak barrels.

4.5,Perfect sherry maturing.
5.0,"Ticks all the boxes for me! Great whisky.
Rich and full of flavours. Sherry, fruity, tropical. Wow!"
4.25,"That’s nice. Strong, sweet, but not overpowering. Got a high alcohol content and had punch but not just vapours. 

Christmas cake, oak. It’s a strong cast strength whisky. Not especially memorable, but very solid."
4.5,"Sophisticated and fun...This is another stunner from Amrut. Smells like a sherry bomb, and finishes with an impressive bouquet of spices. It as if every sip starts out red-vine licorice and travels into old-fashioned black licorice. This bottle will be hard too reach past, and I’m glad there seems to be adequate supply out there in my area. If looking at the experience profile of this on a chart, I would expect to see a ""bow-tie."" This is a thrilling whisky with dramatic swings."
3.75,I have to say this bottle have opened up nicely more so than any other bottle I have experienced. Its quite good now after being open for 2 months now and @ 2/3 bottle.

4.25,Well....I'm impressed . The bottle has been open now . Highly recommended.. Go figure!
3.5,"Complex smell, wood and sherry. Love the aroma. Taste is well balanced, sweet and wood, basically tastes like Scotland. Something sherry casked and sweelty balanced. Interesting"
5.0,"What a fantastic whisky this is. Its just perfect. The Amrut Intermediate Sherry is one of their older expressions (about 6yo) and it is called that way because it is first matured in ex-bourbon casks, second it goes into sherry butts and finally the whisky is finished in virgin oak casks, so the Sherry is the ""intermediate"" one. 

Bottled at 57.1%abv, chesnut color. 

On the nose the rollercoaster begins. Tamarind, guava, prunes, molasses, quince, maraschino cherries, orange marmalade, champagne soda, orange cake, port, and wine from a church. It is just amazing.

On the palate, more red flavor madness: cinnamon liquor, liquorice, orange peel, cane, cherries, peanut butter chocolate. 

Aftertaste delivers something totally different. Lots of minerals, spicy, pepper, sherried port, cinnamon and the sauce used to glaze the pork. 

Overall, this is an amazing dram, an incredible experience. Super sweet and spicy, the higher abv is present in fluent tasting and aroma notes. Just buy it. 
My score: 100/100."
3.25,"I just received and cracked my bottle and have to say I'm disappointed . It has some nice sherry flavors but the alcohol burn is very off putting! Time may help this one open up and tone down the hotness but at this moment I'll give it a 3.25 considering the exorbitant price for such a young spirit,and very disappointing for the $110 plus $20 in taxes and shipping on top of that.I don't get the very high reviews unless those reviewers didn't rate it until it opened up to a better profile. Glendronach 18 blows this away by 10 times or more for the same price point!!"

5.0,Definitely an assertive sherry bomb. I find it a little more pleasant and user-friendly than abunadh. Lots of dark dried fruits with a seemingly meaty or umami-esque backbone.
2.0,"I really didn't like it.  One of my friends thought it smelled like the international Asian market in town, like sulfur and fish sauce.   I really think they used cheap ""Sherry seasoned"" barrels rather than barrels that actually aged Sherry wine.  Very expensive for what it is."

4.0,"It was at the end of dramfest `18 I tried this so my palate was probably getting a bit stuffed. I'll placehold 3 for now and I have another sample at home to more properly explore which I'll open over the next few months. 
Update several months later. Yeah my palate was stuffed this is much better than a 3. 4 I reckon.  Beautiful rich burnt toffee sherry and that was without water. It does have a slight odd artificial taste though, not cherry but something similar which bugs me a bit."
4.0,"Nose - (w/o water) Hot, sharp tropical fruity heat, cayenne spiced grilled pineapple, sweet habanero heat, faint sweet baking spices, cloves. (w/ water) Greatly reduced heat, more strawberry/cherry preserves, less tropical.\

Taste - (w/o water) Hot sweet heat, white pepper burn/tingle, sweet dried red berries, intense tropical sweet, grilled pineapple (w/ water) Softens the heat, adds a creamy yet drying mouthfeel, more rounded/balanced berry/tropical fruit vibe.

Finish - (w/o water) Long lingering red berry sweet, hint of maple syrup, heat fades fairly quickly, grilled fruits (w/ water) Long lasting pear/red berry mixture, very faint bitter like that of pineapple char.

Score - 90/100

Final Thoughts - As I expected, this one comes out of the gate a bit hot. A tiny bit of air time in the glass makes it more tolerable and this odd sweet spice note I get slowly fades a bit with some time. Sherry influence is there w/ bright red berry influence and is mixed with what I get as their standard very tropical hot malt. Oddly enough the hot heat fades fairly quickly. Like other Amruts that I've tried, this greatly benefits from a tiny bit of water as it softens up the hot heat a bit and rounds out everything nicely. It is quite easy to add too much and make it muted pretty quickly though, so use a dropper if you can."

5.0,Tried a sample of this and Kadhambam. This is very good with a very nice floral toffee vanilla flavors. Tastes similar to the Madeira finish. Went with the Kadhambam though.

4.0,"higher abv, first sip very hot.  a bit of ice was nice,  not as sweet as I thought it would be as a sherried whiskey"
5.0,"I had this 2 weeks ago at WhiskeyLive in NJ.  I’d say out of the 50 or so whiskies there, this one and the Balcones rye were the highlights.  Whereas the Balcones was simply very unique, this one was just purely well made innovation.  It was triple matured—bourbon, sherry, back to bourbon.  All in the Indian heat and high humidity, which really ages the whiskey quicker than the Scottish brethren.  It’s a nutty sweet flavor, with a strong hint of vanilla.  Quite potent too..but that’s Amrut’s calling card.  Walking out of the event, this was the best one.  If you see it, worthwhile purchase.  I don’t believe it’s that expensive...maybe $100"
