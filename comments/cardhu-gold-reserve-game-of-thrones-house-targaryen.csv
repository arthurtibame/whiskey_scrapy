2.25,Not a fan.   Definitely more smoke than what I'm use to from Speyside.  Nose is nice but short finish.  Don't know what we're gonna do with this bottle.  I don't like it enough to drink neat.  Maybe mixed drinks.  Don't know what else we're gonna do with this bottle.
3.5,"Average dark chocolate, toffee, and spice."
3.25,Not bad. Better alternatives for same price. Is almost forgettable. Some apple hints and floral.

Mostly honey, a little caramel, and subtle oak.

4.0,Honey is the first note that hits you on the palate and it is pronounced. Not the nicest scotch around but it’s easy to sip and has a nice sweet flavor profile. It definitely gets better once it’s had some time to open up. It’s not for everybody but I personally enjoy it very much

3.5,Tasted on 4/7/19
3.25,interesting!
2.75,Maybe for a beginner this would be tastier.  I get sweet candy flavors at the beginning then fades to a small spiciness...virtually no finish.

4.5,"The nose of the drink features hints of apple and spice.  It is sweet with an almost toffee scent.

The scotch tastes sweet with toffee and apple notes.  It is not peaty, but rather a little briny in the finish.  Hints of vanilla and charred wood can be faintly detected behind the sweetness.  Very good."

3.5,"I’m a little late to the party with this review as GoT has now ended, but better late than never. I’ll skip all of the House Targaryen jokes and historical facts and just get down to it. This is Cardhu Gold Reserve. It’s not available in the US in its standard packaging, but this is the same stuff the Europeans get. Diageo didn’t bother coming up with something new for this one. Bottled at 40% ABV and is chill filtered. As far as the color goes, every whisky in the GoT lineup is exactly the same color. Impossible you say?  Thanks to copious amount of added colorant it IS possible!  It’s a solid amber color. 

The nose is full of honey, barley sugar, malty/yeasty. Quite fruity - but not fresh fruits, more like canned fruits. Cantaloupe, pineapple, baked apples, pears, orange pith, peaches, green grapes and raisins...all swimming in a light syrup. Toffee, vanilla, chocolate sauce. Floral, lavender and honeysuckle, also somewhat earthy and herbal. A light oak with some hickory and a very faint wood smoke. Almonds on the back end. Nice. 

The palate is very malty like the nose. Barley, honey and oak. Nutty - almonds and hazelnut. Black tea, chocolate, tobacco and maybe some leather. Fairly light apples and cantaloupe. Nothing like the fruitiness if the nose. Toffee and butterscotch. Kind of boring. 

A medium bodied mouthfeel that is oily, mouthwatering and then dry. 
The finish is medium length with honey, malt, apples and almonds. 

Not bad for the price (I paid $40). Inoffensive, very drinkable. Lots of depth on the nose, but nothing stands out as exciting. Looking back at my notes for the 12 year old, this is more or less the same dram, but most likely younger. If this was sold here I would buy it again, but only because it’s a cheap and decent Speysider that I wouldn’t feel bad offering to friends that don’t really like whisky. I gave the 12 YO a 4, but that was almost 2 years ago. With my current palate and standards, this comes in a bit lower. 3.5
Cheers"

4.0,"This special Game of Thrones edition is....

THE SAME EXACT NORMAL CARDHU GOLD RESERVE WHISKY.

Having said that, did we just paid a little more just for a label with game of thrones drawings on it? (which is not even beautiful)

Bottled at 40%abv, this is your typical Cardhu, as a matter of fact it resembles a lot of the Gold Reserve... wait.

On the nose: dim aroma of Tobacco, Lemon, grapefruit, Caramel and
Vanilla. Not that great. 

On the palate it is very enjoyable. Coffee beans, Toffee, Tobacco, Pepper and Oak spice. Aftertaste is also nice with a mild smoky note with hints of oak and sawdust. 

Overall this is not a bad whisky at all. Maybe the nose is not powerful enough, shame on me on not even noticing it was the same cardhu gold reserve with a GOT label; 84 over 100."

3.0,"Definitely a honey note on the nose (neat), right off the bat. Along with... maybe spices? Possibly caramel apples. 

First taste (neat): VERY light, reminds me of a red wine, except for the light oak (nice spice taste though). 

Adding a drop of water: immediate apple smell. Love it! Now the taste... very smooth and a slight sweetness.

I feel like it's a good beginner Scotch to break someone in. Definitely going in the Guest Cabinet, but for high-end Guests. Haha. Pinkies up! I may finish this bottle by myself though, so no promises."

3.0,"Winter is coming, and so is the avalanche of GoT-themed Diageo releases. I'm working on picking them up a few at a time to collect the whole set. I freely and fully acknowledge that this is the Mother of Gimmicks more than an attempt by Diageo to release great, hitherto untasted whiskey, so I'm going to do something I've not done before, and that's incorporate the marketing theme's success (or failure) in each bottling into my rating. If you're going to cash in on the biggest show on television, you'd best bring your A game to Whisky Town.

This...doesn't bring its A game. The whisky, in and of itself, is fine. Not spectacular - like just about everything else ever made by Cardhu, it's a classic Speyside single malt, but a bit lacking in complexity, individuality, and memorability. Loads of sea salt-sprinkled chocolate and ripe orchard fruits to be found, with a satisfyingly round mouthfeel and a hint of vanilla and coconut cream. It reminds me almost more of Irish whiskey. It's enjoyable enough, if not spectacular. At $40, at least I feel like I came away with something to show for the money, as it's not badly priced.

What I *don't* get here is why you would pick this as the Targaryen entry. There is literally nothing about the dram that says ""Mother of Dragons"" to me, other than perhaps the distillery's history of strong women leading its efforts. Even then, that's not present in the glass and you have to be a hell of a whisky nerd to know about the women of Cardhu...I mostly know because I've been to the distillery and took the tour. No, give me something with a little smoke for the dragon-riding dynasty and their motto of ""Blood and Fire,"" please. I'd call this a 3.5 normally, but I'm docking some points for dropping the promo ball here."

3.5,"Color: Dark gold.
Nose: Nuts, malt.
Taste: Maybe a little fruity and dry, a bit spicy and sweet. Most prevalent is malt, in a very big way, and it has a kind of soft, creamy quality. It was hard to find other flavors through the malt. Water made it bad and I had to pour out the remainder.
Finish: Malt tapering off."

You can really taste that ash barrel. Then the very raw whisky taste hits you. Tastes like a premature spirit. Will make a great mix whisky, but I won't enjoy it on its own. 

Consumed at room temp.

3.5,"Duh duh da-da-duh duh.  Ah, Game of Thrones.  Television that captured the attention of the world for 7.5 seasons, then it became a show that infuriated most fans in its final 3+ hours.  Well, whisky conglomerate Diageo had to get their hands in on some of the piles of money this show has raked from every corner of the globe.  But how?  Whisky releases that are themed to each House/Major Family on the show, and Castle Black/The Wall.  That should fetch a hefty haul, shouldn’t it?

The good news is that they used 8 solid, scotch distilleries to supply thirsty fans, some of which supplied a new, special whisky just for the Game of Thrones line.  The bad news- some of the bottles contained the exact same whisky already released by said distillery- as is the case with this Cardhu.  Gold Reserve is already a U.K. market release.  They just slapped a Targaryen-themed label on it and re-issued it, although this time it went worldwide.  It’s still 40% ABV, chill filtered and has so much added color it looks just like every other Game of Thrones bottle.

It’s a crystal bronze in color and appears very watery in the Glencairn.  Lots of watery, runny drops form and race back down the ring after a healthy spin.  The nose started out heavily on the apples and pears, an artificial fruity note that I found similar to freshly unwrapped, salt water taffy wafted up for the first few minutes, then mysteriously disappeared and left behind standard vanilla and lightly toasted oak and candied malt.  Some tropical notes emerged as I went in for the first sip and it reminded me of the song “Rastafarian Targaryen”.  (If you haven’t heard this please go to YouTube and watch the Game of Thrones Red Nose Day special from the band Coldplay.  It’s quite entertaining and amusing and takes you back to a time before the botched show’s ending).  

The palate was ushered in by the aforementioned tropical flavors and they are quite enjoyable.  More orchard fruits splash across the tongue, typical Speyside sherry cask notes arrive at mid sip, and despite the rather thin mouth coat- this is an enjoyable dram.  There’s absolutely no heat involved with this whisky- it’s almost like you’re drinking fruit juice.  The finish is short and borderline overly sweet, but as you’ve already come this far, you knew how it was probably going to finish.  It’s not bad, mind you- just sweet.

As I pondered the whisky for a few moments after finishing the pour, I immediately thought of a great way to describe this whisky:  it’s the leftover syrup from a Dole Fruit Cup...with alcohol in it.  That stuff is a waxy and thin, fruity and sweet, and quite delicious!  

I have a couple bottles of this- as I built a few complete sets in case the collectibility went through the roof.  (It did initially, but Diageo got wise and flooded the market with more, and drove the demand back down). Thanks to a sample pour from my buddy, @Generously_Paul from Michigan, I’m able to keep my sets intact.  Thanks again, bro.  I actually picked my bottles up for $32 each and after a quick search I found that the regular Gold Reserve runs about $42-45 online.  So, I got a great deal.  It gets 3-3.25 stars for flavor and I’ll bump it a bit for the $10 discount I got from Virginia ABC.  Cheers, my friends.


Now, Cue the music:


Game of what now?

I'm a rastafarian, Targaryen
I got some dragons and they're
Very scary and
Been here and there and then I've
Been everywhere again
Rastafarian, Targa...
Call me Daenerys Targaryen
When you wanna reach me
And if you feel the love
Then you can call me Khaleesi
Got so many names
I'm Queen of the Andals
Queen of the Meereen
Yeah ! You can kiss m' sandals"
