3.0,"Pretty harsh and aggressive, but theres a good amount of spice that balances that out. Once you get used to the burn theres some caramel bourbon sweetness too. Not at all bad for the price, if you like bolder whiskies."

1.75,"Spotted this for $16 and figured I like sweet bourbons so I should try this........mistake. Poured neat, nose is some caramel and spice with some heat and a dose of oak. Palate is slightly nutty with more caramel, heated cinnamon, strong oak and a bit of peppery spice. Finish is where it goes to hell for me. Drying caramel, cinnamon and oak turns bitter and even a bit sour(like you swallowed some acid reflux). This wont hit you at first. It seems pretty decent then slowly it develops the bile-like aftertaste and it really ruins the whole thing for me. I actually dumped out a couple pours which I never do. This was just not for me...........67/100.....one of my lowest bourbon scores, very disappointed I thought I would like this...ymmv"

null,"Nose: Cinnamon powdered donut, corn syrup, double mint gum, cashew butter, sweet grass, and black pepper

Palate: Lighter mouth feel than one would expect from a 103 proofer. The corn syrup note pushes on the initial and mid-palate, but the spices and nuttiness are prevalent as well. The spice notes keep this bourbon alive.

Finish: The finish really focuses on bitter green notes and cinnamon powder This is definitely sweet, however, it retains its spiciness. The finish leans on the front of your palate and is a little short. 

Overall, for being 103 proof and under $20.00, this is worth grabbing. You can tell they have some younger juice in here. It was originally produced to compete with Wild Turkey 101, but in my eyes, it is not quite there."
3.5,"FC103
NOSE: Traditional Bourbon notes of Vanilla and Oak with Dry Roasted Peanuts. It is a tick hot.
NEAT: SWEET! Coke and Peanuts. This reminds me so much of what we call here in the south a ""Chain Gang Coke"". Simply a glass bottle of Coke with a pack of peanuts poured into it. If you haven't tried it, it is delicious. There is a fair amount of Oak as well. Finishes with a decent Kentucky Hug (though quite smooth for 103 proof) leaving a coating of Coke and Oak. A lingering cinnamon note as well. 
SPLASH: Turns one note Vanilla Coke.
VERDICT: This one is like EW BIB if EW BIB had a teaspoon of sugar dumped in it. Better than I remembered, but I still find it a tick too sweet. When I say Coke, I don't mean it has a Coca Cola note...I mean it tastes like Coke. It is not as peanut-y as Beam, but is damn close. Picked this up on impulse on sale for $14.95, and for that price it is a steal when you factor in the 103 proof. This could definitely find a spot in my bottom shelf rotation."
3.5,"I’m sure this offering disappoints fans of the previous age-stated version(s), but after a first taste I’m convinced you could do worse for your money.  An affordable (< $20), semi-high proof (103), 4-6+ year (presumably - nobody takes a 6+ year product line and starts filling it with 2 year barrels) is a standout value on specs (these days) as long as the taste fulfills.

Optics are that it’s been getting worse (going NAS), but people talk up offerings like Evan Williams BiB on the perception that it’s affordable and a step up from its black label cousin (let’s not forget that black label notably lost its 4-yr statement a while ago as well).

As far as taste, this is strong cinnamon, oak, and vanilla to me.  More baking spices (nutmeg, clove, mace) are there, but definitely secondary.  The spice is long and lingers on the roof of the mouth.  There is a trace of intensity (befitting a whiskey named fighting cock?) that probably drinks about 10 proof higher than its labeled, so admittedly a touch of ethanol that better bottlings don’t exhibit, but it isn’t harsh or detracting, just characterizes the spicy nature of the spirit.  Also, the Heaven Hill peanuts are there for sure.  They modify, but don’t detract from, the primary flavors.

Not quite a quintessential bourbon profile, but those that like it spicy but affordable, drink neat and you shouldn’t be disappointed for the price.  Certainly could do well with a cube.  Actually it’s a nice counterpoint to cola (after neat, I had with Pepsi), but I think this might be the 100% perfect bourbon for spiking eggnog (without trying yet). All the right flavors and punchy enough to cut through rich dairy.  Saving for winter for sure!"
4.0,"For $16, this is the best value in bourbon!  Sweet nose, with some alcohol to let you know this will give you a kick.  Vanilla for sure with a faint hint of citrus and new oak.  Palate is solid, full body with the sweetness continuing.  Great spice on the finish and this has a great finish!  Well balanced and an amazing value! 8.2/10"
2.0,🤢 This is not like it used to be when it was 6 year age stated. Likely won’t buy it again.
1.0,Isopropyl nose with a surprisingly sweet initial taste. That initial sweetness fades quickly into a 103 proof medicinal burn. This one is a hard pass.

3.75,"For under $20 this is a great find. Typical bourbon notes on the nose with sweet vanilla and caramel. The nose is a little young. If you let it sit the alcohol settles. On the palate it’s still sweet with a fair finish. It’s not the best on the bar, it is a great daily sipper."

2.75,"Nose - vanilla, banana, Nilla wafers, similar to JD, moderate ethanol burn. 

Taste - vanilla, caramel, orange/lemon, shortbread, fairly large bite, finishing reasonably long with a tannic feeling.

This is an OK whiskey that benefits from being >100 proof."
