3.5,For the price $14.99 this is actually a fairly smooth whiskey.
2.0,Hard to believe this is 8 years old
3.0,Nutty.   for the money you can get more pleasure with older aged Canadian whiskey !  This one pleased me very much!  Ireland out and want to find it again! Originally purchased at Sid’s in Bloomington MN
