4.0,"Super aggressive grain flavor right off the bat, light spices come after. Good rich body helps with the power of the flavor. Chocolate comes in on the tail."

2.5,Unique and different. Worth a try. Not something I would go back to often but it’s always fun to explore new flavor profiles.

4.0,"Rich and inviting on each level. Aged 3 years and it shows. A dangerously sessionable neat sip. Rich, syrupy honey."
3.5,"Actually enjoying this. Definitely has some young heat to it (that settles down with a splash of water). The barrel taste is strong, which might put folks off, but I enjoy it this time of year. Not a ton of complexity, but woody with vanilla and caramel. A nice linger after the final sip."
