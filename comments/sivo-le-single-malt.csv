4.25,"Lots of fruits, raisins, hints of cinnamon and oak, extremely smooth for its age (at most 5 yo since the family started in 2014). The colour is fabulous without any colorant. A strong recommendation to buy! Good job Sivo!

Tasted it another day, and it gave wonderful aromas if let open up for a few minutes.
Colour: amber gold
Nose: fresh fruits, raisins, maltiness first, then a hint of citrus fruits, later nuttiness, almonds, moving to oakiness, even a little briny and meaty
Palate: raisins, malt sweetness, citrus notes in mid palate, then nuttiness, becomes woody and savory.
Finish: medium, dry and oaky"
4.25,"Excellent complex taste on the sweet fruity, woody and vanilla side. You should try it"
