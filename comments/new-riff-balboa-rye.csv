4.25,Unique and excellent
4.5,Nose is light fruity with a little citrus. Flavor is very full fruity kinda berry coming through. Then you get spices coming through. Not much heat especially for a rye. It finishes with more spice that stays until you take the next sip. One of my favorite ryes to date.

4.5,Very fantastic. Best New Rif I've ever had
4.5,"Neat.  Neck pour.  Immediately reminds me of Little Book Ch. 2 on the nose.  There is this lemon Mr. Clean smell on the top.  More time with the nose reveals this deep, intense rye.  Most intense, pure rye smell on memory.  Behind the spice is a nice vanilla that can find its way back to the citrus and lemon.  Some barrel spice folded around the experience.  Initial impression was odd, but 5 minutes with it has really opened it up.  Zero licorice, but a hint of dill.

Very thick and spicy on the tongue.  Almost all spice and dark up front.  Dark cocoa even.  Gets brighter met on the taste.  Kick of rye and dill, dominate.  That dark cocoa lightens up into a smoother milk chocolate.  Exits with the vanilla and barrel spice on the legs.  Legs are moderate.  It’ll come back in waves if you allow it.  

The experience becomes noticeably brighter as I spend more time with it.

This won me over as the experience continued.  Initial impression was “uh oh....” but now I am sitting here thinking “this is damn tasty.”"

4.0,"An interesting rye. Very different from any others I can think of. It’s thick and unctuous in new riff style  but also extremely light on its feet. Fruit and flower on nose and palate but think light sensations of strawberries, lavender, rosemary and thyme. Finishes with light baking spices, like a homemade pumpkin pie. Nice stuff."
