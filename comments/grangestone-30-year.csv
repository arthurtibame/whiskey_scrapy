4.0,"Nose: Toffee, chocolate, ripe gala apples, caramel, this smells very sweet. Reminds me of a candy shop. Only thing missing is some salt water taffy.

Taste: Caramel dipped gala apple, cinnimon and oak build in, but I can hold this in my mouth all day.

Finish: Strong oak finish, slight chocolate note as the finish lingers. Medium long finish. 

Notes: I picked this up almost 3 years ago before my 30 year birthday. This bottle is just under halfway finished, and has improved from being open. The price is also amazing for the age."
