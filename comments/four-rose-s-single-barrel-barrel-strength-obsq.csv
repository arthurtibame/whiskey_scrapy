4.5,This is pretty close to being my perfect bourbon. Caramel corn on the nose with bits of cherry sweetness and mild spice on the palate. Highly recommended FR recipe.
4.5,"I'm really close to giving this one five stars.  Haven't done that for any glass yet, but I may come back to this one and raise the score.  It's that good."
