3.0,"I love my cask strength whiskies, and i am not a fond fan of rye based drams, even if lately i have had a couple of them. This straight Rye Whiskey, is famous and seems to be a little expensive for what it is. 

Bottled at 64.5%abv, this is one of the strongest whiskies i have ever had. Even if i am capable to handle high abv drams, this was hard. 

On the nose, it is just to strong and seems young due to the alcohol note. Soap, rice and Rice water are the main notes i got. This are typical notes on young american whiskies. 

On the palate and aftertaste is just very spicy. Rye whiskies have this sweet spiciness but this one was too raw and grainy.  I dont usually use water on any cask strength so i figured out i shouldn't use it here too. If the whiskey was good, a little natural air will do. 

Overall this is not what i expected it to be. Way to spicy, not pleasant and really plain for a dram that should be full pf flavor due to its higher abv. 61 over 100."
