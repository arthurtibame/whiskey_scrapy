4.5,Taste like a 10 year old rye. Has a great taste on the front and the right type of spice on back. Great pickup for the price.

3.0,The nose is true oak with a peppery hit. During the first sip you get a sweet caramel that explodes into a peppery rye heat with a deep hit of oak. It's a little warm to the tongue but doesn't go beyond that. So overall it's a mild sippin' rye.

5.0,My favorite rye on the planet.  What a rye whiskey should taste like.
3.0,It's very good. 3 stars is good. I've been away from ryes for awhile so I don't trust my palette. It's very mild for a rye though. Definitely drinkable.

4.0,"First purchase was 3 years ago (at $23.99) and I remember the concentrated flavor like a “red hot” candy. This bottle is less sweet, with leather/tobacco notes - enjoyable and perhaps a more mature statement?"
