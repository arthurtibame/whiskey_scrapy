3.0,"Smoky and peppery on the nose with a slight seaside quality. With water fruit comes more to the fore. Sweet and oily mouthfeel. Hot, black pepper with smoke on the finish. A bit thin. 84/100."

4.0,"Tasted 10/17/14 : A light, smokey nose that is pleasant.  Like a small campfire.  Sweet notes can be found.  A creamy, soft and smooth palate.  Sweetness with a slight peppery note.  Medium finish that ends slightly dry.  Very good, enjoyable dram that will not overpower you with smoke or peat.  A nice balance of smoke and sweetness.  The only real negative is that it is somewhat costly and you may find equal or better malts at a lower price, like their own 12 year old malt."

4.25,"Im a massive fan of Bunna 12 as well as smoky scotches so this peated malt was a no brainer. Specs on sale for$59.99!! NAS but still no coloring and un-chillfiltered. Poured neat, nose has BBQ smoke and peat with malt, honey and animal cracker sweetness. Its soft but its extremely deep, smooth and rich. Inhale to your hearts content without ethanol interfering. I drive by the Salt Lick BBQ in Driftwood Tx everyday and this reminds me of the smell from the pits that wafts out to the road. Oily mouthfeel brings waves of dense flavor. Strong smoky brisket, sweet heavy malt, mild pepper, birch wood, raw honey, vanilla pudding skin and a dusty note in the back. Carries some heat but the level of flavor here is worth it (I may hear angels singing when I drink this). Finish is long fade of the sweet very smoky malt, vanilla, honey and drying charred wood. This does not have the dark fruit notes of the Bunna12. Profile is similar to combo of Bruichladdich Classic, one of my top scotches and Ardbeg 10 with loads of luscious smoke. If you enjoy the smokies you need try this. The BBQ smoke/honey sweetness on this is intoxicating. .............92/100.......Its pricey but Ill have to buy it again(will try and make this one last)"

4.0,"The nose is deceptive with more smoke than the taste. It's a nice bridge between the more peated islays and the run-of-the mill Speysides. Strong notes of peat, smoke, pepper, cinnamon and some brown sugar. Finish reminds me of southern barbeque."

4.0,"This dram hints at its being a sherried one in all its aspects. The color is an opulent amber, and the nose is full of thick toffee, leather, and dark malt. Beneath the tar-coated palate the whisky's body is raisiny and sweet. I taste wood spice and peaches with brown sugar. As I sit with it the underlying sweetness evokes baked oatmeal and cherry preserved. Don't be fooled, though — this is a spicier, more offensive Bunnahabhainn with a salty and pipesmoke mouthfeel and a freaking furnace of an ashy finish. Toiteach might be compared to Talisker Storm but in my opinion is far more exciting."

4.0,"A pleasant surprise! I enjoyed the finish on this more than the Ceobanach, even though it's 20 bucks cheaper. The nose will remind you of the Caol Ila 12 from the start. Peat! Peatier than the Ceobanach as well. Maritime notes with sea spray, along with lemon curd, dark chocolate and vanilla. Not much fruit other than lemon on the palate, but brings more smoke, vanilla, slight TCP, cream, barley, icing, cake batter, and malt flavors. Medium finish and a heavy mouth coat. A breakfast dram similar to a Lagavulin 8. A solid 3.5. The theme needs to be a smoky one too. Something like ""The Doomed"" by A Perfect Circle."

4.0,"Another of the bonus samples from the SDT. Toiteach, pronounced...Gaelicly I’m sure, means smoky in Gaelic. Bottled at 46% ABV, this NAS single malt is non chill filtered and I believe it is a natural color of yellow gold. 

The nose is thick with lemony citrus. Grilled plums, pineapple, peaches and apricots...all covered in salt, set ablaze and put out with a fist full of dirt. Plenty of peat smoke, earthy and brine. Rubbery notes like tennis balls. A little pepper and some floral notes with a subtle roasted nut aroma. It’s young and not very complex but it’s good 

The palate is heavy with smoke, burnt peat and charred fruits. Ashes, rubber, medicinal/bandages. Earthy with a little dry grass. Again, not complex at all but done very well. 

A medium light bodied mouthfeel that is super oily and mouthwatering. 
For an Islay it has a somewhat short finish. Smoke, ashes, light fruits and florals and a touch of bitter tannins. The smoke does linger quite a while. 

Really there is little going on here, but it’s still quite good. The mouthfeel is great, not the best I’ve ever had but still worth noting. The nose is robust. It’s straight forward with no fancy finish, but this Bunnahabhain stands on its own merits. At around $70 it’s not the best value for a NAS but the quality is there. I’m giving a 3.75 but it could be a 4. Thanks for the sample @Telex 
Cheers"

4.0,"This smoky, NAS Bunnahabhain was sent to me as an extra pour from Jason, the newest member of our distillery tasting team.  It’s part of the Bunnahabhain Unable For Americans To Pronounce series.  Toiteach (pronounced toch-tach) translates to “smoky” in Gaelic.  It’s a robust 46% ABV.  It’s light gold, oily and produces very few legs in the tasting glass.  Heavy droplets form slowly around the lip as it settles back after a spin.

The nose is heavy smoke, earthy peat and salty sea air all the way.  I don’t get any sweetness or barrel notes.  They definitely nailed down the namesake.

Flavor wise, the palate follows the nose:  BBQ’d, fatty meats covered in cracked salt and black pepper.  The mouthfeel is somewhat thick and thankfully that allows some bitter chocolate sweetness to settle in and add another layer of flavor to come through.  It’s this drams saving grace IMO- because the finish returns to salty and smoked meats.  The finish is long so this chocolate mid sip note is very welcome.  It saves this from being a one dimensional smoke bomb.

As it is, it’s very satisfying for any Islay loving, peated whisky drinker.  I think Bunnahabhain could have the NAS haters on the run.  I’ve had several from them now and they are all quite well done.  I’ve got a few more NAS bottles from them and I’m inclined to open them all and see if I can back that statement up with an even stronger argument.  This one is a solid 4 star.  Thanks again to @Telex for supplying this one to the group.  Good stuff.  Cheers."
4.0,"Imagine yourself inches away from getting splashed in the face by a cold Atlantic wave.  Just before being hit, you smell this briny, fishy, salty aroma.  Then imagine having chocolate cake, topped with layers of sea salt, and vanilla.  And this long lingering taste of lemon curd and salt.  Bunna’s hit all the right notes with this one, just well executed and enjoyable.  Thanks to @Telex for the sample as part of our little SDT team."

3.5,"Friday’s can’t come soon enough.  Start of the weekend which means some sipping.  Bunnahabhain is one of those under the radar scotches that is often overlooked.  This sample came my way courtesy of @Telex as a bonus sample in our SDT.   I had sampled this some four years ago and it was quite good then.  Will I experience the same today?  Did it change?  Did I change (for the better, of course). 

The color is lightly golden which would indicate natural color. 

The nose starts with a salty and briny with a light earthy peatiness.  In my younger days, I would ride 12 speeds and maintain and tweak them.  A whiff of this brings me back in time and the smell of fresh inner tube with a coating of baby powder comes back to me, (when I replaced or repaired the inner tube). There is some mild sweetness that comes through as well.  Vanilla, apricots, grilled pineapples.  Some walnuts and oak are buried deep within. 

A mild nose yields to strong peat and char.  A nice Islay earthiness in an oily and medium weight body. Quickly intense.  The intensity yields to black pepper spice and a bit of sugary sweetness.  A bit of vanilla and some lemon zest strengthen towards the finish. 

The finish is peppery and spicy at first.  As that subsides, the long, tarry, ashy flavors fill the palate and is ultimately left with some bitterness and drying, oak tannins. 

This is a good, peaty dram that is not complex and lacks a deepthness comparatively to the Islay standards.  A easy peaty sipper. At $70 and upwards, I can get more flavor and complexity with a Laphroaig or Ardbeg at 2/3 the cost.  All in all, quite enjoyable. [86/100][Tasted: 2/1/19]"

2.75,"Can a whisky taste of smoked mackerel? That, plus cold tea, sour grapes, dark chocolate and pepper were the flavors of my sample. The nose is soft, meaty peat with a faint hint of sherry; the finish leaned to the sour notes. Not something I’d revisit, though I appear to be in a minority for not enjoying this more."
