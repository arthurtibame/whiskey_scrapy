2.0,Wasn't impressed for all the hype. Started out with sweet wheat and then rye completely took over. Cool to try once or twice but nothing special
4.0,Little hot but good

4.0,"Good call by Ms. Schuster on the wheat toast with cinnamon. Nose is medium, definite cereal nose with rye spice builds and overtakes wheat in the finish, which is fairly long."

3.25,"A very approachable pour to someone new to Bourbon or who likes a tamer dram. It is very light, soft and sweet due to the wheat character and hints of Rye notes all wrapped in a unique hybrid grain. The aromas and flavors meld together nicely. It is a good whiskey but won’t be repeated as it’s a Washington exclusive."
4.25,"sweet and spicy. Note, actually tasting a TotalWine exclusive 5 year old cask strength bottling, Barrel 138."
