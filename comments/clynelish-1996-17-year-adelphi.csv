3.5,"This was the second of 10 whiskies tried at an Adelphi tasting. The classic Clynelish nose of melted wax and paraffin is well represented here. The palate is rich and fruity: melons and some kind of sour fruit, and then sweet pears on the finish. Neat, it’s a little hot for my liking, but water brings out Schezuan peppers that dominate the fruitiness. A little frustrating that it doesn’t swim well, but if you can tolerate this neat you’ll probably mark it higher than I did."
