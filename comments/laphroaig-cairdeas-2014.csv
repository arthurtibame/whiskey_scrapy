4.0,"Whisky on the Hudson 9/18/2014 : On first nosing, I got the sweet peatiness/smoke (reminds me of applewood bacon) and hint of citrus.  That same profile carries over onto the palate, rich and full.  A nice, long, balanced, oaky, dry finish.  I recall enjoying this very much and need to get a bottle to get a more accurate tasting.  Repetition is the only way to get something right."

null,Not as smokey as other the other Laphoroaigs.  Tasted honey after whiskey had chance to breathe a while. Smooth and easy to drink.

5.0,"This beautiful golden pour is a masterpiece In a glass. The nose is delightful -- the soft perfumes of a summer night wafting over the signature Laphroaig smoke. The viscous liquid rolls onto the tongue with a sweet vanilla crescendo that finishes with honey notes, dry on the tongue and syrupy on the throat. Simply delicious."

null,"Bottled for Friends of Lahproaig in 2014.  This variation was finished in wine barrels but I don't see much difference between this and the standard Laphroaig (my palate may also be fatigued at this point though).

Still solid on its own merits, just not enough of a difference to me to justify a different bottling.  Still glad I got to do it side by side with the 2013 port wood Cairdeas"

4.0,"TCP/Iodine, slight smoke, heavy peat, sugar, and pixie stix are on the nose. The palate is a wonderful heavy mouth coat, a ton of smoke, a wave of oily sweetness, and you can actually taste some age in it. The finish is very long and tastes like buttery popcorn. I only wish the cask was a little more present, but that's not much of a complaint. There is some sweetness in there though. 4.5! The theme of this dram is ""Butter Wouldn't Melt"" by Embrace (UK)."

4.0,"Tried a sample of this side by side with 2013’s spectacular Port Wood.  This scotch has a light, sunflower shade.  On the nose, Amontillado is like night and day from the dark, brooding, and puissant Port Wood.  This dram is delicate and almost demure in its presentation, with among the lowest levels of smoke I've experienced in a Laphroaig.  Instead, perfume scents predominate on the nose, including some floral, musky aromas, and then a bit of coastal gravel or wet sand.  It reminds me in some ways of a Highland single malt blended with a Laphroaig, like something that could come from Compass Box.  On the palate, this scotch features a seductive combination of vanilla and pear that again reminds me of some high-end Highland single malts.  The Amontillado's contribution seems to be these orchard fruits on some sips, and then on other sips, a pronounced caramel.  Don't get me wrong, the palate still has a decent serving of smoke and peat, but nothing compared to most Laphroaigs.  This Cairdeas Amontillado presents a surprisingly savory and smoky finish relative to its taste and aroma.  The smoke really rises up on the finish and packs a punch, giving rise to a classically complex and long Laphroaig finish featuring roasted nuts and cocoa.  Compared to other Cairdeas expressions and Laphroaigs in general, Amontillado is much easier-drinking and more restrained.  Not worth the $130-200 that I see it going for nowadays in Miami, but worth seeking out a pour."

5.0,"I just changed my rating from a 4 to a 5. I’d probably put it between there IF I COULD (**HINT HINT**). This is typical from the Cairdeas line. I have bottles of 14,15,17 (plus QC, 10,15,18 years). I wasn’t into scotch when the 13 portwood came out but I wish I could have tried it.
This is higher proof than the standard Laphroaig. It also doesn’t smack you as hard (despite the higher ABV). Like in the Distillers Edition of Laga and Talisker the sherry mellows the smoke and peat a bit. I like to be smacked but I also REALLY like this. It’s got some nuts and maybe citrusy fruits to go along with the usual Laphroaig profile. Wonderful Oily mouthfeel and long and Smokey on the finish.Don’t put ice or water near this please!! It’s beautiful as is"

5.0,"This is a masterclass on how to develop an Islay whisky with finesse and balance.  It's a soft heather aroma on the nose (like a young Balvenie), with a touch of brine and salinity.  Then the palette continue with more brine, salinity, citrus and caramel.  No where close to the signature in your face Laphroaig, which isn't a bad thing...just shows how well it balances the softer floral flavors with a stronger peat backbone.  Thanks to ModernDrinking for a generous sample!"

Seriously delicious and makes you salivate for more.

Absolutely amazing.

Not much left so if you want to try it get there before it’s all gone!"
5.0,Wow that was good. Building a wall? 11/10/16.
4.5,"Tasted at Delilah’s whisky bar a month ago.

It was my girlfriend’s favourite of the night!

It was so insanely peaty that it took me by surprise! Expected more influence from the amontillado Sherry cask, but it is quite delicious nonetheless. Did not take any notes so can’t be more precise on my description, sorry...  :-("

5.0,"Continuing on with the Cairdeas reviews, here we have the 2014 version that was finished in Amontillado sherry casks. This was actually part of our hotel room tasting session in DC for Whiskyfest back in April, sample provided by @Telex. Bottled at 51.4% ABV and is non chill filtered and natural color of orange amber. 

John Campbell walked with the whisky rep from Persia, listening intently as he rambled on about superior malting processes, the purest water in the land and golden barley the color of the sun at noon. He walked with him as the Persian made claims of international awards and accolades spanning from San Francisco to Bangalore. But when they made their way to the pit of death and the feeble man from the foreign distillery claimed they were the richest, peatiest whisky in the world, John Campbell smirked, looked around at his workers and yelled defiantly in his thick Islay accent...”THIS IS LAPHROAIG!!”, before kicking the man and his weakly flavored whisky to their doom. 

Yes this is a fantastic Laphroaig. 

The nose is brand new shoes that stepped into a bowl of orange sherbet liqueur and then set ablaze by the flaming arrow of Antonio Rebollo after he loosed it from his bow to light the Olympic flame during the opening ceremonies of the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. Strong rubber and bandaid notes.  Dark, rich and sweet sherry, but different than other sherried whiskies out there. Honeyed dates, figs and tennis balls. Varnish soaked oak and iodine. Raspberry chocolate, salted caramels, vanilla, toffee. Very earthy peat with a touch of mint. Fruity Pebbles cereal and Juicy Fruit gum. 

The palate is big billowing smoke with sweet BBQ meats, grilled plums and nectarines. Vanilla, brown sugar and burnt oranges. Burnt oak, ashes and soot. Bandaids, iodine and rubber. Some peppery spice, a little anise and some tannins. 

A medium bodied mouthfeel that is creamy and mouthwatering. 
The finish is medium long to long, fruity, smoky, rubbery with a trace of mint riding into the distance on a horse made of peat. 

Very much the best of the last 5 years of the Cairdeas releases. And probably my second favorite Laphroaig behind Lore. Such strong flavors and the sherry worked as a supporting orchestra behind the soloist that is the Laphroaig distillery profile, rather than taking it upon itself to shred a 5 minute guitar solo. I didn’t think this highly of this dram while in DC, but sitting at home and being able to try it in a controlled environment I can now see how well it shines. Glad I bought a bottle before they disappeared. 4.5-4.75
Cheers"

4.0,"Wow now this is interesting, very very interesting. I don't believe i've ever had an Amontillado before. I call this one the chameleon. Each time I dive into it it brings a completely new thought into my head. First it was like hazelnut liqueur, then drambuie like orange, bam nutmeg, then fennel. Crazy the twists and turns on this one. I did a bit of research and Amontillado is..an expression of sherry, which lies between the pale, dry fino and the well-regarded oloroso. This is an 8 year old Laphroaig from bourbon casks that then finds its way into amontillado hogsheads for one additional year apparently. I also read cedar wood tick, menthol tick, peppermint, spearmint etc. Each time you think of a flavour it spawns thoughts of more.

Now the big problem is that I really am not a fan of any of those flavors and in fact I really don't like any of them so this whiskey is in essence really a homage to all the flavour profiles I detest. Weirdly however I don't dislike the whiskey. Now don't get me wrong I couldn't and wouldn't drink any more of this but I do have to admire the quality and balance of this dram and I can see if you are a fan of these flavors how it could be rated so highly. 

Thanks once again @LeeEvolved for such a fascinating tasting experience!"

5.0,"The familiar flavors are all there. Slightly sweet from the bourbon cask with that amontillado nuttiness pairing with the smoke instead of combating it. The finish lasts just long enough for you to want to take another sip. So glad to have picked this up as whether you are a fan of that bold Laphroaig flavor or not, this is a whisky that drinks like listening to all the moving parts of a professional orchestra!"
