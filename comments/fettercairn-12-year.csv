4.25,"Nose - Ripe apples, honey, hint of orange, golden raisins

Taste - Honey, golden raisins, dried apples, candied ginger spice/tingle/heat, light salt

Finish - Very nice lingering ginger warmth, sweet honeyed golden raisins, filtered apple juice sweetness, light hint of graphite

Score - 86/100

Final Thoughts - This had a very pleasant nose, not too complex but very well put together. Nice balance on the palate as well in that there was nothing off-putting, simple flavors but they all played well with each other. This felt like mostly if not entirely ex-bourbon aged but not much caramel/vanilla but more of a highlighted fruity malt. Nice finish too although there's a slight graphite-like finish that's a tiny bit unpleasant but it's subtle. This was quite a nice dram and honestly drank like it was more of a 43/46% ABV dram versus a 40%.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes

Would I buy a bottle? - Yes"

3.5,"My first Fettercairn was this expression, and i think it is an easy going dram, maybe for an everyday whisky, but nothing to die for or remember for a long time. This is not the one you recommend to friends eventhough it is not bad at all. 

Bottled at 40%abv

On the nose it is very fruity, some tropical fruits coming on the nose, Pineapple. I also got Figs and Peach.

On the palate, very easy to drink, with the same profile as the nose: pineapple, a very noticeable Winey note, Grape and Peach. It it feels like it has been matured in white wine casks because of the flavor profile.

Aftertaste is very clean, easy finish, with mostly grape flavor. 

Overall this is a normal whisky, very straightforward, but you can enjoy it easily and that is good in my books. My score: 72 over  100."
