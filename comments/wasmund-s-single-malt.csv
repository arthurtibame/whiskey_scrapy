2.0,"I agree with the other tasters. The smoke is enormous, and a bit distracting. This is less the case with a splash of water to open the whisky up. It has some nuance if you can get past the smoke. I found myself enjoying it in the end."
3.0,Smokey with a sour bite. Going for that peaty flavor but not quite right.

2.0,"Wood. Quite inconsistant from bottle to bottle. Chunks of hardwood are steeped in the spirit like tea, rapidly flavoring it. Bottlings are frequently less than 6 months old."
2.0,"While I'm waiting around for this mysterious SDT Group to begin I have to open something to keep my thirst fully quenched.  So why not open something local and hope for the best.  This is Virginia's own Copper Fox distilled, Wasmund's Single Malt.  It's named after the distillery's master distiller, Rick Wasmund.  It's a single malt that appears to be continually aging while they pull casks every few months for bottling.  My bottle has aged 18 months and cost a relatively affordable $45.

The first thing I notice is the weird aromas wafting from the taster.  Sweet and spicy wood notes, potpourri.  There's an antiseptic vibe coming off it when you get in close.  It's a bit offputting.  I actually hope it tastes nothing like it smells.

On the tongue, there's a good bit of cherry sweetness and a decent amount of smoke.  Unfortunately, there's no balance to it.  It's like there's 2 whiskies in your mouth simultaneously and as you swish it around in your mouth they separate and fight for dominance.  I don't really like that at all.  It also tastes and feels young (because it is) and a bit too light.

The finish is pretty quick with that Luedens cherry cough drop flavor, borderline artificial, and a hint of the antiseptic bitterness.  I'm glad it's over fast, for sure.

Overall, it's too weird and abrasive for my tastes.  Maybe it needs a full, scotch-length's age over 3 or more years to mellow it out.  Something tells me those flavors may never calm down to a level I'd be happy with, though.  So, it's a dud IMO.  It's gonna take me awhile to finish this bottle off for sure.  It looks like my trading partners may be getting another surprise sample from me, as well.  Hahaha.  Cheers.




(J/k- I would never knowingly send out bad whisky)"

3.0,"I visited this distillery in Sperryville VA and left with a kit that include several bottles of this single malt unaged spirit and a 2L oak, charred cask.  I ""aged"" the spirits in the cask for about 4 months over the fall and winter, which was probably a month too long. The result fit the descriptions on this page, except that mine was way too charred. But starting out as 124 proof, there was room to add a fair amount of water. I brought it down to 92 proof in the bottle and add a few drops more when I drink it. With the added water and given some time to breathe, I get a nice buttery nose with a lingering campfire note. It still is ashy on the palate, but in a nice way. There is a lot of burn through the finish. I've tasted down nearly a bottle now, and its either getting better or my taste buds are branching out in a new direction, because I'm really enjoying it.  Time to get something else going in the cask."

1.0,"I walked into my local store with no intention of buying anything, but rather looking to see what's new.  He convinced me on giving this a try...and I quote him ""it's one of the best American malts, if you're a fan of Highland or Speyside styles, you gotta give this a try"".   Either I got swindled, or his taste buds and mine are polar opposites.  This isn't bad...it's just too young.  The wood influences are too much to handle.  The nose is a strong cleaner type, like Fantastic.  The bleach version.  The palette is worse.  Like biting into a piece of wood.  There's no finish.  None.  I'd be curious to see what this will be like a few years from now...but not sure I'd be willing to spend money for that curiosity."
3.0,Very mild and fruity. Strong oak smoke and applesauce nose. Not much finish.

2.5,"Smells like wood spice, but not oak.  Similar to Cleveland Black Cherry Wood Finished Bourbon.  Then smoke appears along with a malt funk.  Smells young.  The taste starts off with that bold spice and slight sweetness from I what I assume is the apple and/or cherry wood.  Then the smoke starts to build.  Then the malt breaks through.  It finishes heavy with young wood and smoke.  This single malt is quite unique and interesting, but I feel it's a bit of a novelty.  There's something missing.  Maybe more age would make this better.  It's definitely worth sampling at least once."

3.0,Woody. Interesting. Not bad. But not great.
0.5,"This whiskey is a brass color with thin and watery legs.

The nose is very woody, and also smells like burning paint. I can’t say I like it at all.

The palate is oily, bitter, overly tannic, and has a strange note of kale.

The finish, if you do swallow, is of medium length and gets sweeter.

I’m not going to lie, I took only a few sips then couldn’t take it any more. I poured out the rest it was so bad! I love the American Single Malt category, but this one does not serve it justice. Sorry Copper Fox Distillery. Cheers!"
2.75,"On the nose it seems earthy, like moss, more likely from the oak.  On the palate it was more spicy and oak with a warm finish.  They can do better."
4.5,"I loved this. Nice intense aroma, very smooth. Like a scotch without the peat."

2.75,"First american single malt, not bad, but different then I expected. Bright, shArp, sweet, and long spicy finish"
null,Lots of smoke and wood. Not quite the way I remember it from back in the day. Prefer the barrel finish ones to this now as they help smooth out the wood
2.75,"Long finish, cherry finish, maybe some apple"
1.0,Wow the review is correct. This stuff is not good. Not sure why I gave it 1 star. Taste is very woody and like acetone.
