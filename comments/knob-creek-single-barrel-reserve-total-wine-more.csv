3.5,This is a kroger store pick. Nose is peanuts and alcohol. Pallet is more peanuts leather and oak. Heat comes in early and gives that ky hug finishes off with mote peanuts it and burns but mellows out. Taste lingers a while. Solid bourbon with a good burn to it.
4.25,10/14/2004 - smooth and oaky. Overall very good for this price point

3.0,"Spice, fruit and gasoline.  Half kidding on the gasoline.  This is a bottle I have had for a bit and it was about half gone.  I don’t recall it being this burny when I drank it before.  Looks like the picture, nothing on it to denote Total Wines, however that’s what we have in this area compared to the others I see posted.  Probably the same stuff given to stores in different regions.  Burn on the nose, burn on the swallow. Not impressed today."
