4.5,"I had the chance this weekend to sample all three of the whiskies in this new Compass Box series (which seems contrived to persuade you to buy them all). 

Unusually for Compass Box, this one is a single malt rather than a blend, a 15 year old Balblair if we’re to go by the youngest whisky in the bottle. I don’t believe I’ve ever had a Balblair.

There’s a lot to explore here. The nose is bright, sharp and breezy, with lemons, satsumas and jasmine. The taste starts dry and savory, like a Pinot Grigio, then perks up with a burst of oak spice, limes, tart Granny Smith apples and a touch of salt. It finishes on a gentle peppery spice, with limes and grapefruit. 

All this citrus makes for a very different profile from the Scotch I normally drink, and I like it a lot. I’m not sure it’s something I’d reach for every day, but I’d be very happy to have a bottle."
4.25,"Nose is fruity Green apple, citrus with grassy herbs and pencil shavings.  A few drops of water bring out bit of vanilla and leather

Taste: bread, honey, vanilla, leather and tobacco upfront and the fruit from the nose begins to fade in midway witch cereal maltiness. A+ body, silky and creamy 

Finish: mild burn gives way to cinnamon with layers of wood and herbaceous-grassy citrus.  Mouthwatering. 

Fruitier thank a typical highland.  Heck, fruitier than a typical lowland and I love it . It’s a great pour and is up there with my favorite single malts, but there’s comparable or better bottles out there for 2/3’s the cost."
