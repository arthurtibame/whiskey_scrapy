5.0,"Actually it is a blend of several malts across Scotland, matched together to come as close as possible as the original. This became possible after the distillery was able to keep of of the original bottles, found in the south pole. Reverse engineering. Or blending. By the way, it's easy to identify each one of the malts, such Glenfarclas, Jura, and others."

3.0,"Nose: Very sharp and stays that way quite a long time. Delicate fruits with vibrant and very dry oak and ginger. Fruits turn into berries with a fresh, salty air breeze on the back.

Taste: Dryness is strong again, with some sugary notes. Dry and bitter lingonberries along with sweet marmalade and cinnamon. Wee smoke in the background...

Finish: Remains dry and sweet. Bit of spices as well but the finish is way too quick.

Balance: Little bit of complexity and some lack of aftertaste. Surprisingly good, having some character even though it's a vatted malt of 10 different distilleries. A whisky journey with force, even for skeptics."

5.0,Wow! No wonder Shackleton ordered 45 cases for his journey. Extremely well balaced with a hint of smoke and cinnamon. Worth the splurge!
null,Have both The Discovery and The Journey
4.0,"So uniquely interesting that I'd drink it no matter how it tasted. That said, it's pretty damn good. Lighter than you'd expect, with some subtle peat.  Definitely worth a taste if you like interesting  booze."

4.0,"A very good blended Scotch. There are better ones available at a lower price point, but this is such a great story and with the additional packaging, makes a great gift."
3.0,"There is a saying that it's better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation. I can't really judge how successful of an imitation this having not tried the whisky it's copying but what I can say that I'd prefer an original blend from Compass box (ok maybe not Asyla which was a waste of my liver). Now it's not terrible it's just not great and at $120USD a bottle you want something other than a lovely story. Compass Box spice tree is half the price and has an original story and better outcome. Slight oily sweetness, slight peat and it all integrates quite nicely albeit a very short finish a 3.5 rating on a good day. I'd say factoring in price and judging on soley on taste not the art of recreation I'd give it a 3 but I'll add 1/2 a point back for the artistic side. If you love a good story, appreciate the art of blending and use $20 US notes as papers for your roll your own cigarettes this one is right up your alley. Otherwise if you are like me and just want a great tasting whisky where the price is in alignment with the outcome it delivers you aren't missing anything if you don't get to try"

5.0,I love this whisky and the story behind it! Well balanced taste with a hint of smoke. They really made good whisky 100 years ago... I have already emptied 3 bottles!
