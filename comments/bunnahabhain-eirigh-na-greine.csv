4.0,"It’s time for a newer NAS release from Islay distillery, Bunnahabhain. Eirigh Na Greine (pronounced aa ree na gray nyuh) is a non-US, limited release that contains undisclosed age Bunnahabhain spirit that was finished in ex-French red wine casks.  The name translates to “Morning Sky” and it was inspired by the head distiller’s arrival to work each morning as he stopped to watch the sun rise over Islay.  It’s bottled at 46.3% ABV, is bronze/red in color and creates oily and skinny legs in the taster.  It’s natural color/NCF’d and cost about $90 to have imported from the U.K. 

The nose was incredibly weak, even after 20-25 minutes and me having to put my nose so far down into the glass that I practically inhaled the actual spirit itself.  Faint notes of dried red fruits and berries, toasted almonds and butterscotch are there it’s just hard to get them to reveal themselves.  This isn’t a great start.

The palate starts with a bang, though.  A nice initial sherry explosion followed by a parade of orchard fruits:  ripe cherries, green grapes and oranges.  It’s nice and creamy until mid sip when the younger malt presence appears and turns a bit salty and dry.  It was fun while it lasted, at least.  This is the biggest weakness of NAS whisky- you just don’t get a rounded and calmed spirit without the aging.

The finish is all fruity and nutty spice cake.  It’s pretty warm as well.  Long and drying.  It’s not bad, I just wish it left more of an oily mouthfeel instead of a dry one.

Overall, it’s a decent NAS from Bunnahabhain.  I recently bought 4 different NAS bottles from them and this one is a solid start.  If they all deliver like this one I’ll be happy with my purchases.  On a side note, this bottle had a very loose fitting cork and I think I’m going to end up decanting it, otherwise it may oxidize a bit too quick.  Then again, that may help the harshness, who knows?  3.75 stars.  Cheers."

5.0,"Nose - Dark honey, sea salt, dark amber pear cider, strawberry jam.
Taste - Initially thin & drying mouthfeel, oaky aged riesling sweet, lightly fruity tannic, red berries, hint of saline, light oaky drying bitterness, hint of dark chocolate, black pepper spice.
Finish - Lingering oaky riesling sweet, red wine tannic dryness, white pepper tingle, amber honey sweet.
Score - 90/100
Final Thoughts - I really like this one. Nice nose with a balance of fruity and chocolate. A tiny bit thin on the mouthfeel initially but that's not a huge problem as the flavors are very present. Nice balance of what leads me to believe that there was also some sweeter white wine influence here as I get something either riesling/moscato/gewurztraminer sweet mixed with some red wine fruity tannic. Nice amber honey sweet and a tiny bit of white pepper spice. All the flavors right in my alley."
3.0,"Good smell of red wine casks, almost like that in the cellar. High in alcohol thus a good burn finish. Kind of overpowers the flavours. Leaves one with the mystery of dosecting the actual flavours. But has some orange peel."

4.0,"My new favorite NAS offerings are these impossibly tough to pronounce Bunnas.    This one is courtesy of @LeeEvolved .  I’m generally not a fan of NAS,  maybe with the exception of a few, but these new Bunna bottled really make you say “what’s an age statement but a number anyway”.  Salted toffee, oranges, and roasted nuts.  With a touch of sea salt.  Keep making these NAS offerings with tough names...all that matters is the liquid inside.  Thanks Lee!"

3.75,"Nose: red wine cask influence is very present. Red fruits. Briny. Sea salt. Caramel and dried fruits show up after 10 mins. 

Mouth: feels a bit light compared to other Bunnas’ recently tasted. Campari-like bitterness. Feels a bit young.

Finish: not a long finish- red fruits, alcool and bitterness. 

Overall: good scotch, could have benefited from more aging."

3.75,"Olfato: baunilha, adocicado, apimentado, cítrico, frutos frescos, aromas de carvalho, figos, sugestões de banana, marzipan e um pouco de costa marinha. Turfado quase imperceptível.

Paladar: intenso, apimentado, dulçor, bom amargor, baunilha, costa marinha (levemente salgado) e alguns sabores da madeira de carvalho.

Finalização: média para longa. 

Impressões gerais: simples, mas não possui filtragem gelada ou corantes artificiais, e isso eleva a qualidade deste whisky. Bom custo x benefício e vendido exclusivamente em free-shops. Este whisky não possui idade declarada e é possível sentir sua juventude no paladar, mas sem sabores ou aromas metálicos geralmente encontrados em whiskies mais novos."

3.5,"The Eirigh Na Greine is party matured in both Italian and French Red Wine casks, and available as a relatively limited 'travel retail exclusive' NAS release.

The Red Wine influences are immediately noticeable on the nose. This isn't marketed as one of Bunnahabhain peated whisky's, but I do seem to notice some slight peat smoke. I also find some dark fruits, a hint of vanilla, and some salt.
This comes all back on the palate, joined by fresh oak (some bitterness), a pinch of spicy pepper, and more fresh fruit - most obviously berries.
The taste lingers on a while after swallowing, leaving mostly a slightly salty, but winey impression.

Despite the NAS, this drams is pretty balanced, and doesn't seem to be really that young. The Red Wine influences are there, but not dominant, and the combination with the hint of peat smoke is delightful."

4.25,"From the ""unpronounceable"" Bunnahabhain series, comes this Eirigh Na Greine which means ""Morning Sky"" in Gaelic. Actually this whisky, non chill-filthered and without any added color, has a deep copper, reddish tone, just like the sky in the morning. 

Matured in different red wine casks (from Italy and France) this is one fine dram, that promised a lot on the nose, and just couldn't deliver on the palate. 

Bottled at 46.3% 

On the nose is just marvelous. Prepare to read some crazy notes here. As soon as you uncork it, you get a Coca Cola aroma. After a couple seconds, without pouring it yet, it delivers the exact aroma of another rare, argentinian spirit, called Fernet. It transported me to an argentinian discotheque were fernet is the preferred drink. Then, after pouring it, dry brown cake, prunes, old thick orange syrup, everything wrapped in a very nice earthy peatiness aroma. Ashes also appear. 

After 5 minutes breathing, you will get some strange overload of sweetness and i got to say it got me some time to actually detect the exact note.... it was..  Trix cereal. Trix for kids. 

Im not kidding. I loved it. After the first sip, a lor of red fruitiness appear on the nose. There is a cough syrup of kids called ""Coricidin"" which is super sweet. It is exactly that. Perfect score on the nose.

On the palate, it is still a good dram, but nowhere near as the nose. Very nice, starts sweet like red fruits, to turn spicy and then again this trix cereal sensation.
Second sip is very earthy - Dry. 
Almondy.

Aftertaste gives you a puff of smoke right away. A chocolate powder mouth drying note. It is a warm dram, that just drains the saliva. Smoky like cigarretes. Earthy. Short to medium finish. It is woody. Sawdust.

Overall i loved this dram, but the palate and the aftertaste are not as appealing as the incredible aroma of it. I wish i could give it a higher score but the fair rate for it is 88 over 100. For $60 it's worth trying."

3.25,"The first taste is sweet and peppery.  It has a slightly alcohol heavy initial taste with some light oak and fruit, but it’s reasonably smooth with it.  Salty and very slightly bitter on the aftertaste and a medium long finish.

As a NAS Bunnahabhain it’s not bad.  Unfortunately, it promises more than it delivers.  Still a decent dram, but it just tastes too young and loses some of the layers and complexity of a typical Bunnahabhain for it."

3.0,"The nose is really nice - the first nose nothing short of fantastic. It is not really Bunnahabhain as I know it, but so enjoyable. 

The taste is ok but not as special as the nose and feels almost a bid one-sided. The palate feels really young and missing smoothness and complexity. I guess this NAS base is much younger then 10y. For that it isn’t bad but also nothing out of the ordinary. But the nose really was something else."
