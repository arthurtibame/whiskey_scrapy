3.75,"Light copper in color. Pretty standard high-corn bourbon nose. Sharp and spicy on first taste with a thin mouthfeel. A nice, woody sweetness is revealed on later sips, but the heat hangs around longer than expected for 101 proof. A drop of water adds some tea leaves on the nose and opens up some subtle fruit characteristics on the palate. 3.7."

3.0,"It’s totally solid, but definitely nothing special. Very little in the way of nose, a bit of the Willet spice on the front of the tongue, but by the time it hits the back, the flavor has mostly dissipated, and makes for a small burn of a finish. Decent enough for a quick shot or a simple cocktail, but not much else."

4.0,Cousin Claudia brought me a bottle from Louisville in June. Tasty & smooth
4.0,not mind blowing but a nice nose...orange on the palate...combination of vanilla and orange on the finish...purchased mainly cause my family is from Bardstown but pleasently surprised w this pour

4.0,"A dream of toffee and vanilla graze the nose, which is followed by a pleasant amount of heat from the 50.5% abv on this whiskey. The first taste will have you dancing thru orange groves, followed by vanilla sweetness reminiscent of an orange creamsicle. The finish is baking spice, which I am fond of in bourbon. Would recommend in an Old Fashioned."

2.0,"Just not good. It’s way too expensive @ $40. It tastes mostly like bourbon but misses many of the traditional flavor profiles.  I’ve had to drown it in ginger beer and lime to force it down.  Really, there are so many better bourbons for the price and for less.  Please look elsewhere.  No clue how the previous reviewer got a long finish out of this.  If this were at $20 bourbon it would be closer to my perceived value vs flavor but it would fall short to WT101 and OGD."

3.5,"Tasting neat, freshly opened bottle

Nose is unique.  Ethanol and a metallic sharpness along with some oak and slight musty cardboard/leather.  Palette is a round light brown sugar sweetness, with some barrel spice, leather, herbal/mint, saccharin, and vanilla  The trademark Willet rye spice notes come out with some air time, but definitely more subdued than Rowan and Noah. Finish isn't too complex, with mostly oak tannins.

Overall, I like it..it's a little more 'savory' than most.  The complexity comes out with time.  I feel like it's constantly changing as I'm drinking it.  I'm curious how this will be as I empty the bottle.   For $30, I think it's worth it.  For $40, the jury's out..so I'm docking it a bit for value.  It's more than McKenna BiB and over 2x WT 101"

2.25,"Let me wipe away my tear so I can see what I am typing.... this is disappointing. It is another “muscle down” selection. Maybe it will taste better in my starter drink, the ole summer mash up."
1.0,"Copper like flavor and not much depth, certainly not worth the price tag of 25-30, more like the flavor of a $15 bottle, crazy that this has a higher rating than something like buffalo trace. I put this bottle in my garage for when we run out things that actually taste good."

3.0,"Apple cinnamon nose.
Rye spice, cinnamon burn.  Toasted bread, butter and cinnamon.  Burnt brown sugar and tobacco - marzipan in the finish.

It's not bad, it has a lot of good flavors, but they aren't melded or balanced.  It's just ok, but it's pleasant enough."

4.0,"I bought this a few months ago and had a few drinks from it and put it somewhere safe and forgot about it. So when I was cleaning out some boxes I found it again and now it is time to review it. When I first tried this it reminded me of Henry McKenna BiBbut as the bottle has been opened it is something different. I know it is produced by Willett but I have very little exposure to it the brand. It is a solid Bourbon and is a pleasure to drink but it is not subtle it is a big flavored adventure. In the glass, I find notes of oak, vanilla, and a bit of sweet citrus maybe orange blossom honey but that is very faint. The body is where it is at. The sweetness is there but it is not overwhelming. The vanilla becomes creamy and blends with the oak char to make a baked dessert-like flavor. I really enjoyed the body of this Bourbon and when a bit of ice or water is added then the flavor becomes even nicer. The finish is fairly long with some spice and dryness but it does get a bit hot again not unpleasant but it lets you know it is a higher proof Bourbon. It is under $30 in my area but I do not remember how much I paid for it and I have not seen it in my local store. Between $20 to $30 it is a very good choice for your bar, however, if the price goes up too much then it is a no for me. I like Old Bardstown Estate and if my local store restocks it I will continue to buy it. Enjoy."

3.5,"Hint of cinnamon and oak with a light touch of honey on the nose. Hints of toffee and dried fruit in the middle with cinnamon which is what the finish is all red hots. Nice dram glad I was able to find it here in Florida. 
Taste was neat in Glencairn"

3.0,"This year for the holidays I’m going to try a brand new whiskey every day in December. #lifegoals

Dec. 5:

I’ve been hanging on to this one with excitement for a while, because I love Bardstown, and based on its sudden pop up on my store shelves and the full wax top, I assumed greatness. Seeing the low rating just now is disappointing, and I hope the community is wrong.

Color is encouraging. Nose is sweet with caramel and honeysuckle. Honeydew melon. If I try really hard I can get some lemon. Not very powerful, but a solid bourbon nose.

Body is gentle. Very sugary. Powdered sugar. All the sugar. The mouth feel is odd. It feels like you’re biting into something juicy. Saliva glands gone insane. That melon flavor is there too. I enjoy this body.

Finish is spicy with black pepper. If you sip casually, the finish is almost nonexistent. But smack your lips around and take a deep breath, and you’ll see just how hot this finish can be.

This drink is fine. It’s not super special, but at the price point it’s perfectly passable. To further drive the value argument, this honestly reminds me a bit of Kentucky Owl, of course at 1/3 the price. Decent value drinker. Won’t buy another, not regretting the purchase. Community got this one right.

I don’t know if I actually have 26 more new whiskeys lined up, so if you’re reading this and there’s something readily available out there you’d like me to enjoy/suffer through this holiday season, leave it in the comments."
