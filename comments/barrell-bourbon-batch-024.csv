4.0,"Fragrant nose that stings. Lots there, almond paste, sour fruit, honey, wood, musk, sweet pickles, taffy, boiled peanuts, butter, cream cheese frosting, wow, one of the best I've smelled in a while. On the palate, sweet and nutty... a bit of cherry, black pepper, slight cacao nibs, bitter walnut, peanut brittle. Lingering cinnamon into the chest. Finishes a bit too bitter, more than I usually like, so a slight downgrade for that. But lots to like here. 6/19/2020"
