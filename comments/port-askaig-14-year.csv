The palate is very sweet with orange oil infused dark chocolate, all kinds of sour berries. Wow, very impressive.

After the initial taste the smoke on the nose intensifies and delivers some caramelized salty crispy smoked bacon. 

I enjoyed this scotch. What a nice change to other Islay whiskies I had lately."
