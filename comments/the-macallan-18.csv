Absolutely amazing. A perfect blend of sherry and scotch. The nose is strong with dried fruit. The mouth is oily and full of intense sherry, fruit, sweetness. The finish is smooth as silk. 

This takes top prize for the best Macallan I’ve tried. Absolutely a work of art."

5.0,"Perfection is the first word that come up to my mind every time I drink it. The first time I drank it, I thought it was a little bit underwhelming, but the more I drink it, the more I fall in love with it. It’s not about the sheer in your face sherry taste, it’s all about the beautiful balance. It has the distinctive Macallan sherry oak smell and taste, with super clean, short and enjoyable finishing. This is just one of those scotch that you simply crave for more every time you drink it. I think 90 points is a bit underrated. Definitely one of my absolute favorite, on par with the Macallan rare cask."

5.0,"Best signal malt i’v had- thus far. It tastes like any of the “gnar” that lurks around a glass of 12 year seems to mellow out perfectly in the 18 and turn to magic. It’s really nice- the flavors work together like a finely tuned or orchestra - 

Anyway, unfortunately - at $240 for a 750ml sipper @ 86 proof - Macallan can kiss my ass. Love their products- not a fan of the prices."
null,"very oaky. 
typical speyside butterscotch but a level above the rest of the macallan line in my opinion. 
strong on the nose with a slight burn. long after taste.

5.0,"I was at the old alma mater this week conducting on campus interviews for work, which was a good excuse to try some new whiskies. Last night, our recruiting team dined at a restaurant with a $100 per person minimum. After ordering food, the waiter informed us that we were still well below our minimum, so I decided to do my part. For the Firm, of course. I figured I’d start with something that I expected would be both good and overpriced. If you are reading this and immediately think Macallan, yes, you would be correct.

Age: 18 years

Abv: 43%

Setting: Neat in a tumbler while at dinner

Nose:* Traditional sherry nose (no surprise here). Fruitcake, toffee, raisins, nuts, and a note I’ll call “funk” (not a bad smell – it’s just…. Different). Outside of the funk, it smells pretty similar to the 12. **(22/25 points)

Taste: Pretty much the same as above, with some white grapes and baking spices showing up. (44/50 points)

Finish: Medium length and smooth. (21/25) points)

Conclusion: This was enjoyable. It’s better than the 12, but I wouldn’t say it’s all that much better. Quite friendly and approachable, I can see why Macallan remains popular with the casual whisky drinking crowd. For the price, this is an easy pass for me, although I’ll gladly drink it when someone else is paying.

4.0,"Recent favorable impressions of Macallan’s Rare Cask and 18yo Fine Oak helped persuade this purchase. When it comes to single malt scotch whisky, 18 is a “prime” number despite its divisibility. There are many highly rated and affordable in this category. Highland Park 18, Dalmore 18, Springbank 18, Glen Grant 18, Talisker 18, and the current 2 Macallan 18s, to name a few. Add a couple of years to this formula and prices can double or triple detracting from their attractiveness. Macallan was acquired in 1996 by Highland Distilleries, now known as the Edrington Group of Scotland. Highland Park distillery had already been under their umbrella since 1937. Considered the Rolls Royce of whisky, Macallan continues to break auction records with a 60yo Valerio Adami selling for $1.1 million last month. Macallan recently opened their new £140 million distillery that was 6 years in the making. Architecturally significant and aesthetically pleasing, it’s worth a visit to their website to see what your hard earned money is subsidizing. Throughout their history, Macallan has specialized in sherry cask aged whisky until more recently when bourbon barrel integration was introduced around 2004 with their Fine Oak series. This particular Jerez sherry cask 18yo has been a yearly staple now for several decades and is quite good. Its color is a rich amber and a spin of the glass will produce viscous, hard forming legs commensurate with age. The nose is supremely elegant and moderately intense, with doses of dried fruits, vanilla, baking spices and a twist of citrus. A rich and smooth delivery carries more of the same with the addition of toasted almonds and a touch of caramel. A superb finish is highlighted by the expensive European oak and its drying tannins that fade with satisfaction. A solid 4 stars."

This is good; the quality of the sherry cask is very evident and it makes up for a lot of what Macallan does wrong with this whiskey (most importantly watering it down to 43% and chill filtering it). It has beautiful spiced chocolate and rich fruit flavors. 

Is it worth the price tag? NO! Not even close. We’re living in the golden age of whiskey, there are incredible options out there for a fraction of the cost.

5.0,"2017 release. Which means its in the classic purple box for those of you keeping score.

The vaunted Macallan 18. I'd say its the second most recognizable top-shelf Scotch only after Johnnie Walker Blue Label. Of the two, I'd say this one is much more deserving of that status.

Nose: Leather and chestnut. Big sherry, of course. Dark plum, raspberry, blackberry,  raisin, date, fig, and dark grape. Jam and maple. A bit of pound cake in the background. Toffee and orange peel. Big oak note, as one would expect after 18 years in the barrel. A bit of heat, suprising at 43%. It's all cinnamon and clove. Not a trace of ethanol. I could nose this all day.

Palate: The pound cake note jumps right up to the forefront. The date, fig, raisin, and dark grape are more pronounced, though the plum, blackberry, raspberry are still there. Orange, apple, pear, and apricot. Toffee, vanilla, milk chocolate, and caramel. Leather and oak. Top notch.

Finish: Classic Macallan vanilla and milk chocolate. As usual, it hits like chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. Chestnut and almond take over, followed by the highest quality oak note. Some orange peel and a tinge of cinnamon spice. Moderate length.

Dark, rich, deep, complex, fruity, oaky. The ideal iteration of a sherried-single malt Scotch. Generally, when I award something 5 stars, its a high-octane cask strength bourbon or scotch. In this case, I give the Mac 18 my highest praise for its combination of unrivaled drinkability and deep complexity. Truly a rare combination.

This ran me $260. I could've gotten the new, black-box Mac 18 for a good deal cheaper, but I coughed up the extra cash to buy a dust-covered purple box version that I first fell in love with.

Maybe I'm biased, because this has been a part of a couple major celebrations in my life. At the same time, I think that this is one of those whiskies that has shaped my drinking preferences--for the better. Therefore, I've got no problem admitting bias. And trust me, the whisky is damn good. Even factoring the ludicrous $260 price tag into my score, I still felt this to be worthy of 5 stars. Absolute must try for any whisky fan. Top shelf."

This, along with the 12, were indeed the gateway to Scotch.  However, the cost has priced most out, as it has doubled since my first tasting."

Bottled at 43%abv, deep copper color.

On the nose, a perfumed note of sherry, better than the 12yo, vanilla powder and lemon. Pretty nice aroma. 

On the palate is a little harsh, (i am constantly dissapointed of 18yo drams), with a liquorice, oaky note, some brown sugar and creme bruleé. It is a thick but hot dram, harsher but slightly better than the 12yo, both matured in sherry casks, and the finish is medium long, with spicu clove notes.

Overall i give this dram an 85 over 100, which is a normal score for macallans when i rate them. Cheers!"

2.75,Folks... I’m not impressed. The first initial taste was very harsh and bland. The rocks had to kick in for it to be enjoyable. With the rocks it gave it a smooth taste like its rare cask. The smell was very faint. Wouldn’t try it again
