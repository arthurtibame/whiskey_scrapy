3.0,Sooo sweet. Absolutely no bite to it. Perfect for non-traditional drinkers.
3.0,"Butterscotch, whole peanuts, very sweet. Dessert"
2.0,"Soooooooo........What the fuck...?

I don't normally go in for the flavored stuff, but this was available as a sampler and I was in a hurry at the checkout at Total Wine because Covid-19 and ya...impulse buy. The last impulse flavored whisky I bought was the Dickel Tabasco finish, and we all know where that one belongs. There's been some rumblings about this pour in the last year. Let's see what the hype is all about.

The bottle says this is 35% ABV. Fairly standard for some of the flavored stuff. The peanut butter is definitely (read: in your face) there on the nose, but so is butter, kettle corn, and some honey. I'm guessing a corn-based spirit here. On the palate it enters....holly shit....fuck.......cloyingly sweet. Like drinking caro syrup. Good lord...not a subtle entrance. Like if someone liquified a peanut butter cup and added alcohol. After a moment to adjust, it's not bad, but it doesn't taste like whisky either...I'm guessing this was designed as a mixer for foofy cocktails. 

One star and change. Because flavored whisky, but an extra .25 for the novelty of the thing. Good if you're in the mood for desert, but not if you're in the mood for a whisky. Also, sorry for the profanity. It's been some time since I had such a viceral reaction to a spirit of any type. Taste at your own risk."

4.0,"Very sweet, smooth, strong peanut butter taste, great aftertaste, nice pair up with a good cigar and a beer"
4.0,Never would’ve given this a chance but man are my taste buds glad I did. So smooth and hardly goes down like liquor. A blasphemy on all accounts except for my guilty pleasures.

3.0,Sweet syrupy with a nice peanut butter taste. Definitely a candy treat.
3.5,Peanut butter and honey
2.0,"Honestly, this taste like Brandy with peanut butter liquor. If you are into flavored whiskey you might really like it. Very rich peanut buttery nose. Smooth like brandy but nothing complex. Great for a party for non whiskey drinkers."
