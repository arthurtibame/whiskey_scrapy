3.0,"Tasted at The Bluebird Inn, Cornwall, PA. Nose grins up at you with sweet, bright, fragrant apple and caramel. Bold (almost Irish) vanilla carries into the palate with oak and a touch of hot menthol. Drying finish, some cinnamon, woody and a bit resinous, but in a pleasant, satisfying way. A cheerful, mellow-bourbon-like experience."

4.0,"Really like this one, don't be turned off by the Glenfiddich power house, this one is nicely crafted and in my opinion a steal at $49 for what I get. Very sweet, with lots of sweet baked apple, medium finish, wonderful aromas that indeed remind me of a well crafted bourbon but with the distinct character of a single malt (no confusion here, it does NOT taste or smell like a bourbon but it share some elements). Reminders me a little of a Balvenie but stronger and tastier. 3 drops of water nicely opens it. I will come back later as the bottle changes..."

Taste - Vanilla brown sugar sweetness, very buttery/oily mouthfeel, cinnamon heat, lightly bitter like if you burnt an apple peel.
Finish - Lingering cinnamon warmth, lightly bitter orange pith, muted candied orange peel, light bitter oak like that you get from an oaked chardonnay.

4.0,"Truthfully, I figured this one would be crass marketing more than good whisky, but I will admit - this is a solid offering from Glenfiddich, and (for me) an improvement on the classic malt. The nose was really restrained when I sampled this - some vanilla, spice, and a bit of toasted wood. Palate-wise, the classic Glenfiddich pear note is here, but swirled with creamy vanilla, baking spices, ginger, and white pepper, with a long, beautiful poached pear ending. I'll happily drink this."

Malt flavors, some bitterness, oak, fruit, and a slight medicinal flavor at the end. Nice warmth. Apart from the great nose and the wood notes, not as bourbony as I was expecting, but I was probably looking for too much. This is a pleasant pour, not quite an easy sipper for me given the level of bitterness (not overwhelming, just a bit more than I prefer). A great one to try with buddies during a whisk(e)y tasting. 3/14/17"

4.0,"It seems Glenfiddich spent some time in the Bourbon country, either that or this is Glenfiddich's cousin from the states visiting the Speyside region.

On the nose you immediately get the soft bourbon sweetness you'd expect. Sweet corn undertones and hints of dried mango and fruits.

Body is more like a bourbon than a Speyside, that is, more viscous than smooth.

Finish starts off subtle then expands at the very end for a very non spey finish.

If you're a fan of Glenfiddich and bourbons, this is an interesting single malt to try. It's a niche, but it accomplished what it set out to do."

3.0,"Glenfiddich doesn't move me the way Ardbeg or Laphroaig do, but I came away from this drink with warm feelings.  The stated purpose of this scotch was to merge some bourbon flavors with Glenfiddich, and it's exactly as advertised.  It would be a strong gateway or transitional drink for a bourbon drinker trying to get into scotch, or vice versa.  It has a much lighter and maltier character than any bourbon, but the top notes are honey, toffee, and vanilla, more so than any of the usual fruit notes from Glenfiddich.  It may be an unfortunate consequence of having this after the intensity of a cask strength Booker's, but I didn't detect a lot of unique notes here.  The additional two years of age does help smooth this out compared to Glenfiddich 12, and it's not much of a price bump at a reasonable $50 a bottle.  If Glenfiddich 12 and 14 were the only two bottles on the shelf, I'd opt for this one for the extra $10-15."

On the nose, there is Jolly Rancher apple candy, maple syrup, brown sugar, lemon and orange, while on the pallet there is the bourbon'ish note of vanilla, without the sweetness. The finish is likewise vanilla. This is one of my favorite scotches, which retails for around $42 (750ml)."

There's a harder to find but definable sweet note, displaying candy and tropical hues. I got banana and wood upon first contact. That's all mixed with a mild heat to get your salivary glands working over time. It's only on the finish that you detect baking spices and walnut. 

This one is has something for everyone to love at some point along the journey.

I don't know what it is about the scent it's so relaxing.  I had a lot of bourbons before ultimately preferring scotch after being introduced to Glenlivet and I dunno, something about this nose brings back every single good vibe I've ever had at whisky tastings or sharing whisky with friends.  It's just all at once it's overwhelming.  I bought fifth on a whim which is unlike me but I gotta say damn.  This is fantastic.

Tastes like I’m biting into a nice fluffy berry muffin. The bourbon influence is really nicely balanced here, and being a huge bourbon fan, I’m really enjoying this.  

This one is weird but after chewing on it for a bit trying to pinpoint the familiar taste I was experiencing, my mind flashed back to being a kid eating cookie dough off of a spoon. I love how whiskey can do that.  

Not my favorite thing ever, but really nice, pleasant, and somehow comforting. Will keep this one in the collection from now on!"

Taste: Sweet apple, honey, bear claw pastry,  molasses, burnt cookies, ending in a woody and waxy walnut.

Experience:  A cool fall day at golden hour. The sun is just about set and everything is lit with a warm glow, you pick up a walnut or pecan (you cant tell) on your stroll home through crisp leafs. The air is sweet with many meals and treats being cooked in doors, before you step inside to the warmth of home you take a deep breath of perfection. Not the chill of winter or the sticky sweet of summer, but the round comfort of fall.  

*Note: This was my first  ever Scotch purchase. It was love at first sip, I wanted to give it another go now that my taste has developed.  I have had the chance to try and own much more expensive, old, and rare whiskys, but for the price, this might be one of the best. Don't get me wrong there are better, but I've paid 2-3 times what this bottle costs and came up short. Get it if you want to raise your bar of what quality scotch is."

3.0,"Nose: floral,

4.75,"This whisky has such richness and complexity, and it’s mostly because of the maturation. It’s been aged in Kentucky bourbon barrels and finished in American New Oak barrels from Kelvin cooperage in Kentucky. This gives it the richness that a lot of bourbons have. It doesn’t have barrel bite like bourbons do, but the barrel richness is very much there. While the barrel imparts vanilla flavors in bourbon, it imparts char notes in this. And it perfectly compliments the classic fruit flavors in Glenfiddich. Plus, the 14 years allows these flavors to harmonize quite beautifully. The char notes are quite spectacular. I highly recommend this to any fan of whisky."

4.25,"With how modern family life is these days, we find ourselves having to really make an effort to ensure we have dedicated time, unplugged to reconnect. For my family we have a big spread in ages of our children (7-20 yrs old) so we have all commit to a Sunday dinner where they all participate in making dinner, eating together and then cleaning up! My job is to ensure all ingredients are in stock (chicken marsala this week) so off I went to my local grocery store. As one does, I always peruse the Whiskey aisle and happened to notice this one on sale for $38.99. I'd had my eye on it for a long while and figured it would make a great grill companion grilling the veggies. 
My hesitation had always been that I am not typically a fan of Bourbon only maturation on non Peated Scotch and to be honest I am not the biggest fan of Glenfiddich 12, 15 or really the 18 for the $$. However l, under $40 let's roll the dice! Let's see if it was money well spent:

On the palette it's surprisingly rich and almost oily with big orchard fruits (apricots mainly), butterscotch, cereal malt with a dash of honey buttered toast. Vanilla becomes more evident on the mid palette with toffee and some spice. The Finish is a medium length with more fruit, malt and dark honey and brown sugar notes. Lovely dram!

Now this is not all that complex at all but what it does it does incredibly well. Glenfiddich did an outstanding job of showcasing Bourbon matured Speyside and not straying from that objective. For the price point it's a really great deal. I for one will be adding this one as a Scotch I will always keep on hand. 

Cheers all and here's to another week!"

3.5,"In the summer my preferences turn toward bourbon. I prefer the sweeter dram over ice rather than Scotch’s drier, smoky profile. I bought this with the Glenglassaugh Evolution looking for a sweeter Scotch for summer sipping. The Glenglassaugh fits the bill. This is also a pretty decent summer whisky, but not quite as good as the Evolution. 

This expression from Glenfiddich is aged for 14 years and finished in new charred American oak. In theory this should add some bourbon characteristics to the final product. I’d have to say it succeeds. It’s bottled at 43% ABV, is a medium gold color in the glass, and forms a few quick forming legs when given a swirl. 

The nose is sweet grassy barley. The bourbon influence is very noticeable: vanilla and caramel behind the malt. Just a touch of burn, but for a 14 year old malt @ 43% it’s a little much. Water had no appreciable affect on the nose. 

In the mouth it’s sweet honeyed orchard fruits, and buttery malt with a thick mouthfeel. Again, water doesn’t seem to have much effect. 

The medium finish is sweet malt with a hint of smoke and pepper. There’s an odd sour note after everything else fades, or maybe it’s just me. This is the one aspect that water affects: Water seems to extend the finish. 

Overall for $40 this is a good deal. A 14 yr old age-stated Scotch for under $40? Yessir! Good but not great. 3.5/5.0."

4.0,"For the money this is a very fine whisky. Here in PA, the 12 year standard is $50 and this 14 year Bourbon Barrel Reserve is only $8 more...a complete no-brainer.  I actually first tasted it, as I often do with non-exotic priced liquor, with a snack, either a sandwich or some cheese and bread/crackers. This delivers wonderfully  sweet fruitiness on the nose and in the mouth. At sip, a warm bit of spicey on the inner cheek and tongue combines with a fruity sweetness. I get everything from peachy/mango to coconut with this one. The finish at swallow is medium and there is a lingering aftertaste of sweet long after. I'm thinking certain kinds of hard candy, the really good tinned English/French stuff. And yes, there is also apple fruit, well after swallow. 

A wonderful bargain by a storied brand, though the less complex Irish Knappogue Castle gives it solid value competition for $15 less in PA.

3.0,Nice and sweet. Nothing special though
4.25,"This 14 year-old Glenfiddich was the first whisky I ever purchased that I'd consider ""beyond entry level."" At the time it seemed like a big step up from anything I'd tried previously. I'm excited to see how this ranks now that I've got a proper basis for comparison.

Nose: Classic speyside with a couple bourbon notes. Vanilla, toffee, caramel, orange, honey, orchard fruits (apple, pear) and apricot. Some cereal grains and oak spice to round it out. Very malty, light spice. Over time, a banana note emerges, as well as the cola note I usually only get in bourbons.

Palate: Vanilla, caramel, apricot, apple pear, honey, milk chocolate, and orange. More of the big malt notes, but it seems more mature and refined here; none of that cereal grain. The oak is also more pronounced here. A bit of cinnamon and baking spice. Bourbon influence is apparent.

Finish: More of the same, fruity, floral notes. It's more of that apple, pear, apricot, orange until the oak and baking spices/cinnamon take over. Short-to-medium length finish. After an additional taste, I get a superb toasted oak note that really brings this up a notch for me.

Solid effort. Nothing too crazy. This is a nice cross between a Speyside fruit bowl and a touch of bourbon of influence. I'm enjoying it quite a bit. It hits all the right notes and it's balanced throughout.

Factoring great VFM, I think 4 stars is fair. If my memory serves me correct, this may be my favorite Glenfiddich I've had to date, regardless of price point. Well-balanced. Glad this one holds up for me. If you're a fan of the classic Speyside profile, you're in for a treat with this one. Well done, Glenfiddich.

Bumped it up to a 4.25 on subsequent tasting. Had a couple more times and have really been digging it. Awesome stuff."

The palate is really smooth, with the apple spice sweetness and oak forming the foundation. There is a flash of bright fruits, particularly raspberry, before it darkens up with molasses and some char rolling in to tamp down the sweeter elements. The oak and barrel notes finish the experience, with the worn used oak and the new oak bouncing off each other to see which one can have the last word. Ultimately the worn, slightly dry oak has the last breath as the apple and vanilla also give one last appearance."

3.5,"Im a fan of the Deanston Virgin oak so been looking at this one for a while. $41 on sale so had to go for it. Poured neat, nose brings bananas foster, malt and spicy oak. 86 proof is higher than some other Glenfidds but deep inhales are unencumbered by ethanol. Palate is lots of sweet vanilla, caramel and rich malt bolstered by the spicy oak. Carries a little sizzle and heat but the deep flavor is worth it. Has a kind of cream soda vibe to it. Finishes with fading malty vanilla, cinnamon oak and char. This is another candidate for bourbon guys looking for a scotch. Plenty for the scotch lovers too. Its got robust malt, good sweetness and strong barrel char influence all with a 14yr age statement(though it drinks like a 12). I think this is a tasty albeit hot single malt........86/100.......better than the 12 yr but the 15 and 18 are cut above"

4.75,"For me, this is kind of the gold standard and one of my two primary whiskies.  The nose is quintissential Scotch in it’s purist form...one whif is like coming home (though I tend to inhale a number of times before moving on to the initial sip).  And on the tongue, just delightful...probably the easiest drinking and most satisfying whisky you’ll ever find.  It’s Speyside all the way (no smoke to be found) with lovely notes of barley and vanilla, and just enough bite bottled at 43% to give it all the body and character you could want.  When I’m in the mood for a Highland Scotch with a little smoke, I go with Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban 14 or Highland Park 12...but alternating between those and this one is just about all I’d ever need (not that I’ll stop sampling new drams...ever!).  To give you a further idea how good this is, it replaced Macallan 15 Fine Oak in my bar when the price on that one shot up so dramatically...and frankly, I don’t feel like I’m missing out on anything at all.  Highly recommended."

4.25,"Sweet, but not overly. Overall it’s very nice to sip. It’s smooth and has a good amount of flavor. I was hoping for something close to the Glenmoragie Nector Dor but this doesn’t quite line up.  There’s a sweetness Nector Dor has that I haven’t been able to match.  This reminds me of Aberlour 16 but it doesn’t have any of the floral taste Aberlour 16 has which makes it better to me (I’m not a fan of the floral taste.)"

Finish is short but nice with oaky and fruity notes and a touch of bitterness.

4.75,"Tonight I'm drinking the Glenfiddich 14 Year Bourbon Barrel Reserve Single Malt. This was actually the first scotch I ever tried, so thank you to my father for having good tastes. This scotch is a US-exclusive offering, meant to cater to our bourbon loving palates. And while it's not particularly bourbony, it brings some wonderful sweet bourbon vanilla to the playing field. I picked this one up at Bevmo with a coupon for $36.99 and wish I could consistently buy it for that price. My detailed thoughts and rating below: ⠀
⠀
🥃 Glenfiddich 14 Year Bourbon Barrel Reserve - 43% ABV
⠀
Nose: Sweet honey, barley, and a little mint. Brown sugar and vanilla. Mellow apple fruitiness.
⠀
Taste: Barley, honey, sugar, and caramel. There's a nice cerealness to it. The apple notes are more subdued and are only present in more of a sweet apple pie flavor. The barrel influence comes through here much more than on the nose, through both vanillan and tannins. This is a fantastic desert whisky. It's like a spiced creme brulee whisky.

The texture is slightly oily and the finish is medium. Flavor-wise, the finish carries nice honey and fruit sweetness along with some tannins and baking spices and warmth. Im very much a fan of this whisky and it might be my favorite of their offerings that I've tried (12, 14, 15, and 18).
⠀
Current rating: 93/100"

3.0,"Light golden and medium body.

The nose is like apple cider, a pungent floral honey and cereal notes in the back.  Warm oak and tannins linger in the background.

Palate on the front is pretty typical Glenfiddich - dry, sun-dried oak, slight ethanol burn.  The back of the mouth picks up the vanilla and cream brûlée’ from the ex-bourbon barrels.  

All together still a single malt scotch with a faint amount of bourbon influence for me.  Not enough to draw away a bourbon drinker I’m afraid.  I’d like to believe the ex-bourbon is more of a four roses like influence with some sour and spice.  That said, still not enough comes through to make me think “bourbon!”  

The finish is floral and relatively short and dry for me.  As a Glinfiddich fan I say it’s a keeper but pour this for the single malt crowd.  Anyone hoping for a rich, caramel, spicy dram will be left disappointed."

4.25,"I had been hesitant to try this one. The barrel aging process sounded very similar to Glinlivet Founders, and I had been disappointed in that one. However Ctrexman posted a recent positive review. I am sure that Ct and I could have different preferences in our whisky, but I have NEVER found any disagreement with his tasting notes. (In fact, his palate is more attuned than mine.) Cutting to the chase, I found it on sale for $35 and plunged ahead. Nose and palate are very similar. Both show caramel, vanilla, hint of fruity light brown sugar, malt, a little spice, and a small touch of biscuit. It has a nice, soft mouthfeel and very little burn. I would describe the finish as medium; and, if you wait for it a slight astringency at the very end of the finish. I think that comes from the oak. Overall this is a very tasty Scotch that many would not recognize as a true ""Scotch,"" much less as a single malt. A good Scotch to introduce to newbies, and particularly those who don't want the peat reek."

4.0,"Oaky on the nose. Very smooth, no burn until swallow even then is minimal yet lingering. Light notes of Carmel and dried fruit. It finishes with a bourbon after taste and tingles your tongue. Interesting bottle"

3.75,Smells similar to JW Black Label right out of the bottle. Very sweet flavor that reminds me a bit of cognac. Gonna have to drink more to get a real solid feel for it. I like it but don't love it at this point. Has a slight spice to it with a nice after taste.

4.0,"This is my first real foray into the world of scotch, and I have to say, I'm impressed!  Being a bourbon guy, I went for a Speyside, easy ""starter scotch"" with bourbon influence, and this is absolutely stellar.  You get the bourbon right away on the nose and it carries over to the palate.  Creamy and sweet with a distinct chocolate Tootsie Roll note that keeps me coming back.  I don't see myself venturing too much further into scotch, but this may be a new staple around the house!  Oh and a $5 rebate, heck yeah..."

4.25,"Complex and smooth. Nose begins with creamy vanilla, then goes on to citrus and apples, some oakiness and hints of maltiness and spiciness; on the palate fruity, with green apples and citrus notes, hint of nuts shows up, even smoke from the charred barrels, very creamy and clingy; long finish with oakiness and nutiness. A lovely dram!"

3.5,"honey,  cereal forward on the taste with short, semi- dry finish. light on the fruit flavor. At first it reminded me more of a scotch finished in sherry casks.   The more I drank,  the more a young bourbon came out. Finally got cinnamon on the aftertaste.  My palate has been off lately"

One of my favorites. I usually buy this products if I cannot make a decision to buy."

4.5,Fresh smell of apple carmel and vanilla. Very fresh smell of fresh cut apples. Very sweet taste of fruity apple and oak at first taste.
4.5,"Sweet notes of caramel, vanilla and apples on the nose. Fruity notes as soon as it hits your palate with a slight aokiness to it, and a predominant apple aftertaste that lingers in your palate for a while. Fantastic scotch!"

3.5,"It's quite good for what it is, but a bit too sweet for me. Love the nose - sweets from fruits and a bit of barley (I'm just learning what barley tastes/smells like). Palate: more of the same, but I was hoping it wouldn't be so sweet. Overall, very nice and will please many folk, as it is wonderfully balanced, etc., but, my mood at the moment says too sweet (but still enjoying)."

3.75,"A fan of most scotch from an ex bourbon cask, this is certainly no exception. Typical bourbon notes with a hint of white chocolate. A preferred house bottle."
2.5,"nice scotch/bourbon mash-up; vanilla and caramel, slight black licorice at the end"
3.5,Aggressive but great flavors. Good experience for an intermediate!
3.5,"vanilla, as you would expect; green apple and sapling oak"
4.0,"Nose: Subtle hints of vanilla. Sweetness of sugar and fruit. Oaky as expected from a bourbon cask.

Palate: Sweet and smokey. Vanilla and caramel with some orange notes. Oaky taste is pleasant.

Finish: Longer than expected. Sugary sweetness lingers with some vanilla trailing behind.

Overall Thoughts: Deliciousness as expected from a Glenfiddich, admittedly a personal favorite. Sweetness goes a long way for me and this has a perfect blend of hearty and delicate flavor. I was gifted this bottle a few years ago by a Scottish friend and I’ll always be happy they introduced me to Glenfiddich."

5.0,"I’m loving this one!! Such richness and spiciness.  I get wonderful complexity on the nose and right as I’m going to the palate I get the bourbon.  Long spicy warm finish.  The 43% abv is just enough power for this whisky, any lower and it would fall flat.  Best of both worlds.  When scotch meets bourbon and have a baby.  But make no mistake, this is definitely a single malt scotch whiskey!"
4.0,Nose is sweet and malty with a rich almost buttery palate of malt and oak with a strong malty finish. For anyone who is wondering it’s fantastic in a highball
