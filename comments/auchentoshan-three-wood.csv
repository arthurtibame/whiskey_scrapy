Paid: $65

Auchentoshan is a fresh and light spirit.  Unfortunately by using extra “maturation” in really shit Oloroso and PX sherry casks, you get an unbalanced and, at times, unpleasant Three Wood.

There are some good flavors in here.  Some cherries, and dark chocolate sundae fudge with chestnuts and hazelnuts.  But I can’t ignore the plastic and the Sulphur.  It’s just bad sherry casks, bad cask storage, not enough maturation, or all three.  It’s shameful to charge premium NAS prices for this.  It’s not a terrible whisky; it’s worth maybe $30-40, but it’s priced at twice that, and I don’t see where the money went.  The wood is garbage.  It was shit that was going to be tossed anyways.  It’s obvious.  Reminds me somewhat of Laphroaig Three Wood, except that was salvaged by an intriguing play with the medicinal Laphroaig peat.  This is a sad whisky by a sad distillery.

MARK: 75/100.
Not recommended."
5.0,"This is my favorite Scotch so far.  It is an enchanted forest in a glass.  The nose has black cherries and plums with raw sugar and a hint of chocolate (reminiscent of Black Forest cake).  The palate proceeds with the notes from the nose but also earthy wood and tree nuts.  The finish is an old forgotten library with dusty, leather bound books and old oak shelves while the cherries linger.  It all stays with you and slowly fades like a pleasant dreams coming to an end.  Magic."

4.0,"Auchentoshan Three Wood. My first Lowland I believe. (actually no, I think I tried the Blood Oak....) Still have that 21 year old Auchentoshan bottling from Clydesdale I got for my birthday....I have to say, after this I'm even more exited for that. 

The nose is a very interesting combination of sherry bomb highland with spices and less sweetness. Fruity, malty notes are dominant, along with some dried plums and a dash of pepper. To be honest, if this had a bit of peat, I think we would have a top shelf candidate on our hands. 

The taste is surprising. It offers even less raw sweetness than the nose promises, and that's not nessecarily a bad thing. There is the typical vanilla and malt, together with some honey sweetness. That has a tiny bit of bitterness in it, just to balance everything. I also get reminded of blueberries, plums are blueberries are always a winning combination. The taste is almost a bit chewy, like the dried plums. There is also a really strong coffee note that I have no idea where it comes from, but it gives this malt just the right spice to not degrade into a full on dessert drink. 

Plums and coffee are what clings onto your tongue the longest. Very interesting dram, and not that expensive to boot. Auchentoshan is doing things right in my opinion."

null,"Color is leaning towards a dark amber and deep copper hue. The nose is so well integrated and balanced. You’re first hit with huge amounts of sweet pipe tobacco as if you were opening up a fresh bag. Once that blows off, it morphs and unveils blackberry, blood orange, brown sugar, dark cocoa, toasted walnut, and a refreshing minerality buried underneath. The palate stays cohesive throughout all stages. The initial palate hits with tobacco and then rather quickly swells into citrus, sweet berries and honey. The finish leaves you with sweet walnut notes into tomorrow. Sláinte to the Lowlands of Scotland!"

3.75,"The AUCHENTOSHAN has a surprising chocolate copper colour. Very light nose with plenty of fruits (liquorous clementine and blueberries).
Lost smell of dark chocolate as well.
As advertised on the bottle it appears as a complex whisky but sympathetic and easily accessible with different tastes of chocolate, caramel and fruits, a little of cinnamon.
Contrary as what was written, I only had the smell of toasted hazelnut together with what seems to me like salted popcorn at the very end of the dram. But could not get the taste on my tongue though.
Surprising at the firsts taste. All the fruits taste are finally overwhelmed by the chocolate and caramel which is a bit disappointing after a so good beggining to not keep up until the end.

4.0,"It's been a long time since I've had any variety of Auchentoshan.  The nose has a hint of bourbon, brown sugar, spice, alcohol, raisins, and perhaps something like figs?  It's full body, but fairly mellow.  There is an earthy note from the sherry finishes, but it's far less sweet than I expected from something in a PX cask.  The finish is long, spicy, there is some wood, but it reminds me more of pine or cedar than what I typically think of as oak, and the wood is not excessive.  There is a spicy burn, but more like white pepper than black.  Dark chocolate comes out along with a bitter grassy flavor that I associate with lowland whiskey.  It's not going to replace Islay, but it's a nice change of pace.  It's nice to be reminded that scotch can be great without smoke."
4.25,"Stunning colour. Deep dark as though it was heavily poured with iodine.
The nose is powerfully warm, full and alluring so one might not back away from the glass and then really get dizzy.
Aroma is full of really dry and a bit bitter raisins, prune, dark chocolate, black currant, burnt sugar and almond.
Polish and citrus zest notes typical to Auchentoshan are recognizable in Three Wood but they tie up with that plummy bitterness though.
With time it starts to reveal some splendid sticky-sweet dried ashberry and chokeberry aroma and it even has a light but piquant jojoba oil fragrance-alike scent.
The taste correlates with the aroma - full bodied, warm, complex and sweet - unputdownable. The citrus hints and bitterness are a bit more expressed so are the sugar and prunes as well. Some spices, fig, syrupy cherries (sherry cask influence), licorice and creamy biscuits.
The finish is all sweet again. Not very long with a bitter end on a palate.
Auchentoshan Three Wood is one of the sweetest malts I’ve ever tried so it might be compared to bourbons in its sweetness and not lose a game in that case."

The wood lingers into the finish.  The cocoa is a major flavor component that persists through the dry wood.  It's got some spicy burn that rests somewhere between cinnamon and pepper.

No salt or spices. Only a bit peppery, just for the saying.
I usually enjoy Auchentoshan whiskies. My favourite one is an Auchentoshan, but this one is definitely not one I would recommend. Especially given the price. I wanted an Auchentoshan especially tonight, furthermore a Sherry but I'm not happy with this one.

4.25,"The nose is sherry, jammy fruits and stewed prunes. It reminded me of the rancio aroma you get from a great, old cognac.
The palate is soft with chocolate covered raisins, over ripe stone fruits  and some woody notes.
The finish is medium length with lingering PX sherry.
I enjoyed this immensely. It's quite a sweet whiskey, but not cloying."

3.5,"This is really smooth with some smoky wood presence, plenty of sweetness, and apricots. It does remind me of Bushmill's 21, but the flavor is less deep and the finish is shorter. A bit of salt enhances the flavor, which is generally rich, but not to the extent that red fruit, spice, and deep smoke would cause. It tastes perhaps like Glenmorangie The Original meets Bushmill's 21. There is nothing wrong with this, but I wish there were more of it. I would never have guessed that this was aged in Sherry casks rather than Sauternes."
