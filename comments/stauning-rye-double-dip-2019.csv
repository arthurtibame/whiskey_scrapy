3.75,"Nose: initial eraser rubber, moss and fresh wood. Then a bit of orange or apricot and a faint fruity sweetness like raisin. 

Palate: very aggressive in the mouth. Black pepper, a bit of sulfur. 

Finish: a smooth light body in contrast to the aggressive start. Notes of cinnamon, and still black pepper.

Edit: after coming back to it again I get much less rubber and more wood in the nose. Even some sirup sweetness. The palate has a twist of medicinal herbs."
