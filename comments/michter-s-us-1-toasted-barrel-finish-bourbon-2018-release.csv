1.0,"Overpriced for what you get, but that’s expected with michters. I paid $75 for it and at that price there’s some high expectations. I probably won’t be buying a Michters product again unless they either change their pricing strategy to be more competitive in that category or increase the quality of their bourbon. 

Do yourself a favor skip this and buy old forester 1920 instead."

4.25,"Corn, maple syrup/vanilla, and smoky wood on the nose. I disagree with the expert on the taste. As I gave this the old Kentucky chew and swallowed it, the maple syrup showed up in a big way. Yes, there is plenty of spice to go with it, but this is still a very sweet and syrupy bourbon. Oak joins for the finish. You can tell it’s a bit on the younger side, but the toasted barrel finish adds more than enough to elevate it. This is a solid four stars and a little extra. I would continue to buy at retail every chance I get."

3.0,Very similar nose to eagle rare. A lot more bite tho. Not bad but not my cup o bourbon to say. Nose suggests sweet but bring strong flavors that contradict that statement. However this was only a sample and can fully judge it based on that alone I have bottles I have hated and enjoyed very much later.
2.25,"Smoky cherry sweet plum initially. Not sure if it’s my palette or the toasted char finish, but it all goes bitter in my mouth after that. Disappointing because I really want to like this bottle"

3.0,"My second pour during the AZ Whiskey Community collaboration session on Saturday and this was one I was really looking forward to. I have yet to have any of the toasted barrel expressions but had heard generally positive things. Let's see if it lives up to it's hype:

Palette is a little thin but rich with caramel, vanilla and oak right away. Spice arrives on the mid palette and you get a good dose of the subtle wood smoke you sometimes get from these double barrel finishes. Finish is fairly short and again oak dominant with the caramel returning. It definitely drinks hotter than it's 45.7% ABV but is a smooth pour. 

All in all it's not bad and if bought at SRP @ $60 its a fair value if you are a fan of oaky Bourbon. I personally wouldn't buy a bottle even at SRP as big oak is not my preference. 

Cheers all!"
3.0,"Smooth, but less back end.  Kind of flat"
4.0,"Light body, but absolutely no burn either. Light spices on the tongue, longer there through a great tail despite the body. Very approachable."
4.75,I love this bourbon. Dangerously easy to drink.
4.5,Incredibly smooth and has a great transition from nose to palate to finish.  Nose gives off a nice toasty oak with sweet caramel and vanilla.  It’s very light in the mouth with a great balance of the sweet and toasty oak.  The finish gives just enough spice to give a warm linger without losing its smoothness.  This is a great pour.  8.9/10

4.25,"This has become a top 5 bourbon in my collection. The familiar vanilla and caramel of most bourbons, with oak, leather and a little spice, nutmeg, black pepper near the end. I wish the finish was longer and the price is on the high side."
5.0,"Nice and smooth with notes of vanilla, peach, caramel, cherry, and corn."
3.75,banana walnut bread and leather nose. there's a cookie taste with a body that evokes maple syrup.

3.75,"Oak on the nose with baking spices.

Smooth with a nice mixture of sweet up front and then spices.

It’s good but I’m not sure I understand the secondary price hype over it"
3.25,"I really wanted to like this more especially given how much I've enjoyed other Michter's products and how much I spent on the bottle.

Nose: Heavy oak and not a whole lot else.  A little vanilla and baking spices in the background.

Flavor: Again, heavy wood.  Also toasted coconut, toasted marshmallow, and baking spices.  I kept feeling like I was just starting to taste the signature sweetness from the Michter's bourbon but the heavy wood felt like it was masking it.  More alcohol bite than I'm used to from Michter's, probably due to the high bottling proof.  The mouth feel was very drying kind of like a very oaky chardonnay.  Not something I'm used to from a bourbon.

Finish: I liked this the most.  Toasted coconut and dark chocolate but it was too fast of a finish.

Over all kind of disappointing.  I've read that the 2016 release was better.  I actually waited four weeks after my initial taste of this to see if I liked it better but not much had changed."

4.75,"Excited to review a Whiskey which Bobby Axelrod from the tv series ""BILLIONS"" always drinks. 

I believe this is the best american whiskey i have ever tasted (excluding bourbons).

Bottled at 43% with a russetmuscat color 

On the nose is nice, complex. Starts very sweet, with sugar, bananas, powdered sugar, and if you let it breath a little it will become fruity and citric, with orange and lemon peel notes. Finally it mutates to lemon pie.

On the palate is FANTASTIC. i even gave it a 27 over 25 to throw some extra points in there. Oranges, apricots, pleasant oakyness, ginger, pepper, some smoke, very thick very chewable. 

Finish is short but amazing. Like an instant ginger bomb, enjoyable. 

Overall i give this beauty a score of 97 over 100 and i recommend it."

4.5,"Nose- roasted marshmallow, white cake, vanilla frosting, coconut, oak, nutmeg, baking spices

Palate- Wood, roasted marshmallow, mint, caramel, cinnamon, vanilla

Finish- medium, soft finish with notes of herbal mint and sweet marshmallows

Very unique, one of my favorite noses on a bourbon. Love the cake and marshmallow notes I get. Palate is not as impressive as the nose, but still good. The palate starts off with the traditional trifecta (vanilla, oak, caramel) and then branches off into some sweet notes and finishes with herbal. Some love it, some hate it. I love it"
3.0,Unique!  Nice smooth light bourbon that subtlety changes to a oaky finish.

4.0,"A little about the process and philosophy here, as I have always appreciated Michter's strategy as a true labor of love, and careful crafting.  Michter's goes into the barrel at the lowest entry proof of any current bourbon or rye (105 vs industry standard of about 125) that is huge and was at ine time the gold standard for bourbon entry. Their barrels get lightly toasted, set aside, THEN are charred in a second process in order to release more sugars and less tannins.  The distillate can get deeper into the wood, and their limited releases often utilize a second, naturally toasted barrel instead of a quick dunk in a former wine or additional used spirit barrel in order to add a more natural oak finish.  What does all that mean, and why is it important to this bourbon?  Let me break it down for you:
1.  On the upside-  Lower entry proof means less added water reach the final proof.  You are getting more of the finished product closer to its barrrl proof.  The yield is generally fuller, richer, and buttery.  Downside-  More angel's share yields less bottles and increases the price.  When each barrel yield is less, the price goes up

2. Upside- The extra barrel toasting step imparts a delicious sweetness, and a more natural finish, (especially on the  toasted barrel process like this one).  Downside-  it is expensive and time consuming as the barrels sit for longer aftrr the first step before filling, and the toasted finishing takes longer to achieve.  It takes Michter's awhile to crank these out so their releases are sporadic.

So on to this one.  The nose is caramel and brown sugar.  Not as sweet as their sour mash, but it is candy-like.  The taste starts sweet and then pepper kicks in.  A bit of bitterness is imparted that gives way to a more doughy, bread-type flavor.  Think that yeasty pizza dough or fresh kneaded bread smell, but in a healthy taste.  I am thinking this has alot to do with the toasted finish as I don't find this in the standard bourbon.  It is different and well recieved.  The finish is long and a bit spicier.  Where the nose was sweet, the finish gives you more allspice and vanilla.  All in all this is a pretty good one.  Not my favorite Michter's (I prefer rye from them, and find their barrel proof and toasted finished rye to be among the best rye out there every year), but it is somewhere in the middle.  If you can get this around the msrp of 69.99 it is a buy.  Not worth some of the crazy secondary prices though."

4.0,"Michter's label implies that it is a brand that has been around for some time, Pre-Revolutionary War even.
The brand ""traces"" it's roots back to 1753 when a Swiss Mennonite farmer, John Shenk, first started distilling in Schaefferstown, PA. In 1800's the distillery was renamed Bomberger's and operated under that name until it was closed due to the Prohibition in 1919.
After reopening, the distillery went through a few owners and in 1950's the name Michter's was officially born. Lou Forman, who was the owner at the time, created the brand name using the names of his two son’s: MICHael and peTER. Ultimately, the original distillery site shut down in 1990, it's equipment looted and some buildings completely demolished. After 7 years, the trademark on the brand lapsed and Chatham Imports quickly scooped it up.
This is Michter's US*1 Toasted Barrel Finish expression from 2018. It's their US*1 Straight Bourbon sourced from other Kentucky distilleries and aged supposedly additional 26 days in toasted (not charred) barrels.
On the nose there's familiar vanilla, brown sugar bourbon notes along with a bit of sour apple and oak. On the palate honey, cinnamon spice, oak, brown sugar. Finish fairly lengthy with brief black pepper spice and lingering honey sweetness.
Very well done expression where flavors blend together perfectly without anyone of them overpowering the others."

3.75,"Nose: Cedar, toasted coconut, white pepper, vanilla
Palate: Oak, pepper, milk chocolate, honey.  Brown sugar and ginger on the finish"
4.0,Straight ethanol and wood on the nose. Deep wood and vanilla on the first wash with a pass of coconut and marshmallow. Roasty and quick finish.
