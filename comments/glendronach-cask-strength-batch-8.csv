2.0,"Gotta love these ""expert"" reviews. Jake Emen gave this a 90...I can't even get to words how absurd that is. but anyway.

So yeah this is supposed to be mostly 10 year whisky but it's NAS so we're sure they dumped bad low age stated stuff in here. 

Nose - so sharp and acidic, the alcohol is brutal. Chocolate and vanilla along with citrus and again more alcohol. Water tames the alcohol but same notes otherwise. 

taste - young and spirited. The PX gives sweetness and vanilla and chocolate while the PX gives some dark chocolates and perhaps some fruits. Water makes the whisky more bitter though still focuses on the same profile, I am ok with or without. 

A perfectly drinkable super proofed scotch but the youth and quality here are nothing special. A solid 2.0 average whisky. Again the idea this is a 90 is so absurd I can't even start. This is more a 75 if you're a big fan of this style or a 65 if you aren't. in no world is this a 90. 

That said this is massive HUGE upgrade from the terrible batch 7. 

I rather am enjoying this but the price at 100 for this seems off. This isn't close to 100 dollar whisky."
3.5,"Newly opened
No water

Nose - subtle smell, sweet dark fruit, sharpness of alcohol

Taste - medium punch of fresh fruit, clean banana finish, lingers"
5.0,"It does not have the heat. Light nose, but opens up with a drop or two of water."

3.5,Aroma is full and fruity with darker earthy notes combining nicely; Palate is very similar with minor shifts in the profile from tropical to more orchard style of fruitiness; Finish is a muddled sweet and earthy profile. It’s nice.

3.5,"Color: Deep Gold

Nose: Oak, nuts, dark chocolate, cocoa, honey, coffee, and vanilla.

Palate: Dark chocolate, caramel, cherry, oak, raisins, coffee, sherry, cocoa, and spicy notes.

Finish: Long with more hints of nuts, cocoa, oak, tobacco, and leather."
3.5,"The first of three drams from a recent visit to the Flatiron Room in Manhattan -

This is the second Glendronach Cask Strength I've sampled, with the first being Batch 2.  While Batch 8 is certainly not bad, I liked Batch 2 more.  

I love Glendronach, mainly because of the rich, full, and multi-note sherry finishes.  This sherry notes in Batch 8 are less promintent and less spectacular than some of my favorite Glendronachs, with a more prominent spiciness present here.  Unfortunately, the spiciness is somewhat non-descript.  

This is one I'll try again if I have the chance.  More than most other whiskies, my palate responds differently to Glendronach with each tasting.  I'm not sure why that is.  For now, I find this to be a pleasant, easy and reasonably enoyable whisky, but not among Glendronach's best"
