The amazing thing about this whisky is that the flavors keep changing in the mouth, from one thing to another and another and then back again, falling and rising like the eponymous phoenix. I wasn' t able to take notes at the time but it was perfectly rounded and smooth."

5.0,"This is an exceptional special release.
In my opinion not only the finest release 
By Glenfiddich, but rather of any modern single malt.

I have tasted the entire line of Glenfiddich including age 30 back to back, and that is really what you will pick up here.

As all educated whisky palates know the further back you feel the tingle or ""burn"" as some call it,
the older the whisky.

I am pleased to tell you there is whisky in excess of 40 years old in this bottling.  When you taste it it does not just hit the one spot. It hits the mid-front of your tongue and keeps going backward like a heavenly waterfall from the blessed homeland cascading you to the bliss of the chosen few wise enough to purchase this bottling."

4.0,"Nose is heavy pear with notes of vanilla and apple. Taste is smoky, wood, sweet honey and finishes smoky."
5.0,"The nose is delicate with apples, pear, raisins, honey, dried fruit and. gentle spices in the background. The palate is equally as delicate with pear sweetness upfront along with straw, honey, dried fruit and gentle baking spices mixed with orange oil that warm the mouth. The finish is long with lingering sherry, straw, honey and baking spices. Complex and excellent."

4.5,"Hello friends! I finally achieved one of my dreams and went to Scotland. A beautiful experience where i managed to taste more than 60 whiskies in 10 days. One of them, was the iconic Glenfiddich Snow Phoenix. A very limited release from 'fiddich, with a nice story.

It seems that in 2010, one of their warehouses collapsed because of the heavy snow that fell. From the barrels that survived, this whisky was born. Labeled as ""The Snow Phoenix"", a mythical bird that rises from the snow tragedy.

Bottled at 47.6%abv, pale straw color.

On the nose, it is complex. Green apples, Chocolate, Some lemon with spices; Vanilla cream, thick. Some sherriness spice. Chocolate fudge. 

On the palate: Vanilla, Pleasant spices, Some chocolate, Almonds. Vanilla Milkshake that turns into an apple juice, that then turns into pleasant spiciness. Very complex and interesting.

Aftertaste is good. Sider, ginger, creamy. Very pleasant.

Overall, this is a great whisky. Since i have the bottle back home, unopened, i had a special feeling for it, and that sonehow made me think this one was going to be a 100, but it is not. A solid, well deserved 92 over a 100 is a suitable score for it."
