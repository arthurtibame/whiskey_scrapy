3.5,"This is a new annual release from Buffalo Trace marking the first major Kentucky Distillery to put out verified Kosher Whiskey. This specific release shares the same mashbill as the Weller line of Bourbon's. In order to assess the quality of this offering let's compare it against the Weller 12 yr.

For reference they are both distilled by Buffalo Trace and come from the same mashbill. The Weller 12 is bottled at 90 proof vs 94 proof for the Kosher Wheat. The Weller is age stated at 12 yrs vs the Kosher Wheat is 7 yrs (though in press releases they stated 8 yrs).... So what's the verdict?

As per usual it's not a simple answer... The Weller 12 has more noticeable oak and tobacco notes to offset the sweet notes upfront.... The Kosher Wheat has no noticible oak notes, however has a lot of classic notes I associate with a better 107 batch... It's definitely the sweeter of the two and much simpler, but it's also tasty and very easy to drink. 

In conclusion the Weller 12 is the more complex and classically better Bourbon, however the Kosher Wheat is an offering that would please any Weller fan and would make a great 107 alternative. Happy national Bourbon day all!"
3.25,"Nose - grains and cherry, lots of vanilla and alcohol.

Taste is very much wheat forward. Some spices, but not hot. Nothing overly complex.

Light finish, pretty quick..overall, very solid. Only picked it up because it’s new. Not disappointed but not wowed either"
