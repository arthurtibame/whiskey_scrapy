4.0,Not sure with this one yet. Still early in the relationship. It’s got a sweet and sour side with a round full middle a snap of spice thrown in and something that lingers. It will be a fun journey. Definitely worth the price for an 18 year. Letting it sit awhile before tasting makes a big difference in the enjoyment of this.

2.25,"A good basic nose but nothing out of the ordinary. What is special is a nice sweet peppermint and cotton candy. 

The palate is very nutty with a good bunch of oak and wood. The finish is very dry.

Not my cup of tea."

3.25,"Ah man such high hopes for Billy Walker's new endeavors. I've been (with 1 exception) disappointed so far and it's not just been me. We did a blind Glendronch 7 dram tasting and the mystery dram was one of his offerings the 12 year...it came last even after a shockingly bad Glendronach 26 year (which they again served up to me at another tasting but that's another story about the decline of that distillery...). Anyhow maybe he can turn things around as the youngest of his offerings the Cask Strength 10 ys Batch #3 was a great dram, better than Adelph's efforts with this distillery. 

It's a bit like a star football coach who moves to another team and stuff never fires but you see glimpses of the future...usually you never get to realize the vision as they are out on their ear within a few years. Billy owns the place so he has longer to prove himself and cleanse the crap of the past.

Anyhow that's a long winded way of saying don't waste your money with this one. Tired casking, averagely construsted and zero soul, character or identity. I'm not even going to describe it as not worth the effort."
