5.0,"Nose: salt, lemon, alcohol

Palette: first lemon and then a really light salt flavor that you would find in dark chocolate with salt. Thick viscosity. 

Finish: Sweet and salty. Lingers with persisting salt flavor. 

Overall: My favorite whisky so far. Anything coming from Caol Ila seems consistently good. 5/5"
