3.0,"Salted meats and bacon on the nose.  Some salty air.  The aroma doesn’t quite carry through fully on to the palette.  Less bacon, more dark fruits and brine.  I only had a pour from a sample I bought from TWE, but nothing about this indicates any desire to run out and buy a bottle.  Instead, get the 18 for less, with more complexity and flavor."
4.0,"Basically a Bowmore Tempest with rough edges. Still quite delicious and well crafted. The peat, medicinal quality and sherry play nice together. I like."
