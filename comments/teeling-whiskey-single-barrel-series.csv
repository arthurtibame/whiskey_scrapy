4.0,Jenn loves this.
3.0,"It pains me to give this one 3 stars. I love Irish whiskey. I love Teeling...well, at least I tend to strongly like Teeling. I love single cask/barrel whiskies. Why does this one seem so off? I blame the casking work. I was generally unfamiliar with Carcavelos wine (white port, basically)...I knew white port existed, and even tried some in Lisbon 11 years back, but it's hardly something I drink on a regular basis. And, man, is it overpowering in this bottling. On the nose? Ripe white peaches, and not a ton else. On the screamingly hot palate? White peach. Water it a bit to calm down the burn? I'll give you three guesses, and the first two don't count. Don't get me wrong, I love peaches - they're a personal favorite, especially white peaches. I even like stone fruit flavors when they show up in whiskey - you don't see it every day, and it's often a nice touch. But this isn't a touch; it's a full-on slap in the face. I expected more from this bottle, especially at the price. It's not bad per se, but it's a letdown just the same."

4.0,"Port wine creates a sweet flavor that adds well for the flavor left from the bourbon casks, but the high ABV dominates."

2.0,"Sometimes I think these distilleries take stock that didn't turn out so well and add extra maturation in unique casks, hoping it'll sell.   This one is like a 6th year senior...he should've matured and graduated by now, but something is just a tad bit off.   So apparently Teeling took a 12 yr old and matured it for an extra year in white port casks.  Did you know white port even exists?  I've had red port before, tawny and ruby, but never knew of white.  Maybe selling casks is the way white port makes money, like Sherry I guess.   Anyway...color is fairly light gold.  Nose is strong paint thinner.  I'm 80% nose, so this just isn't working for me.  Palette is mild...peaches and breakfast cereals.   Like Quaker Oats Peaches and Cream.  Finish is loooooooong!!! Burns back of your mouth, astringent with an after taste of hazelnuts.  Was this meant as a mixer?  I've never had any mixers---just red wine and whiskey.  Maybe this is meant to have with soda (haven't had soda in 5 years either).   Would I buy this again?   No.   Where is the classic Irish whiskey that has tropical exotic fruits like papaya and mangoes?  ( I'm Indian....those aren't exotic for me, but I guess it's exotic in Ireland).  Irish whiskies I've had usually have this round rich fruity backbone.   Too bad Teeling tried to model this after paint thinner instead of manages and papayas."
