5.0,"Having gone through several bottles of this, I have to wonder why the Distiller review doesn't mention the big bold banana and nutmeg notes on the nose and the finish. Makes me wonder if they actually tried it as this has been consistent across all batches for years."
5.0,"Awesome stuff, very dynamic and tons of flavor. Something that you'll really remember and a taste that really stands out. I tried this and then went out and bought 2 more bottles and I can't wait to finish what I'm drinking now and get back to the Lot 40!"

5.0,"Distiller's notes are dead on here: this is one of the best Canadian whiskies out there (and at a beautiful price, though it's been gradually climbing as the manufacturer has come to realize its value). Forget what you know about Canadian whisky before trying this one. Any family resemblance is incidental. Flavours befitting of a 100% rye: sweet rye, floral rye, spicy rye. Like a bakery at Christmas. Clove, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg. Especially cinnamon. Brown sugar, raisins. Fresh pears. Hay, grass. Dill pickle. Light vanilla-butterscotch ice cream. Taste is peppery, full of Christmas spice, light oak, fresh rye bread. Fresh and preserved fruits. A borderline transcendent whisky for me; probably the whisky that made whisky as a category just downright ""click"" for me."
null,"Fantastic Canadian Rye. Full bodied, very smooth, pleasant lingering spicey finish. Best rye I have had the opportunity to taste."

4.0,"Wonderful Rye. Lots of spice up front and in the finish.  There is good some sweetness too, soft fruit, some say banana, but I pick up almost cherry. Oak comes through in the dry finish. Surprisingly smooth Rye, but not tamed like some other Canadian Rye. If you like bold and layered Rye, pick this up. Look for the 2012 though or the yellow label.  I enjoy it a bit more than the green"

4.0,I've been so used to American Rye being bold and spicy but this has all the characteristics of amazing rye without that punch to the face you sometimes get. I found this to be really delicious.

4.25,"Huge fan of regular 40, was lucky enough to find this. 

Nose - sweet dark chocolate hints

Taste - Pepper first, sweet vanilla/caramel finish. Spicy! Incredibly smooth for the price


Worth trying if you’re lucky to find - love it. Let it breathe and I’m sure it opens up just as good regular 40"

3.75,"I'm new to ryes, so I'm still learning these flavors, but I found this to just be a solid whiskey thats not very sweet and can stand up on its own with some dusty, tobacco, woody, slightly herbal, and maybe a hint of a caramel-like flavor (sans the sweetness) behind it.

It reminds me of whiskey you might have found at an old western saloon in 1845 - its got the dust, spice, wood, and a firm, unyielding but not brash attitude.

It's not my favorite whiskey to drink on its own, but its become my go-to for making whiskey cocktails."

4.0,"A long day like today earns the reward of savoring the end of Lot 40's 2012 single copper pot still. It's one of my go-to Canadian whisky brands, but this one, oh this one sips so smoothly with its toasted honey, vanilla and malty rye flavours that provide a winter-warming tingle on the tongue. Best enjoyed with a side of jazz in a cozy chair. 8.5/10."

3.5,"Nose is sweet corn with a hint of vanilla and just a soupcon of burnt cherries (as if someone had shown the bottle a Xerox of picture of burnt cherries). Taste is sweet, creamy, very slightly oily, almost dreamy, milk chocolate with a little bit of hot red pepper. Aftertaste has a bit more of a kick than the original light, sunny sweetness would make you think was coming. Absolutely pleasant if not thoroughly memorable, the kind of bourbon that is gorgeous, but not handsome. A worthy addition to your shelf."

5.0,"I remember back as a geeky chemical engineering major in college, I was dating this one girl who was the nicest, sweetest human being.  She was also stunningly gorgeous.  But...she was at a all girls college in a rural part of the state, which had a dozen others that looked like her.  Her value there I'm sure was minimized because everyone was good looking.  When she started hanging out with us engineers, she stood out like a gem amongst coal pieces.  That there is Lot 40.   For years, this whiskey never got its true credit.  It probably was overshadowed by the Scots, Americans, occasional Taiwanese Kavalans and Indian Amruts.  But, it's a gem.  Probably one of my top 3rye based whiskies (along with Midwinter, and Crown Royal Noble).   It's slowly creeping up in price, so might be worthwhile to get it while it's still reasonable."
