3.75,"Nose: Maple, caramel, butterscotch

Palate: Nice oily mouthfeel.  More maple and caramel.  Smooth initially. Spiciness coming through later and lingering.  Some black pepper notes here.  Initial smoothness gives way to some burn. 

Finish: Medium length, dry, spicy, with hints of brandy.

Overall pretty good. However not the smoothest and not overly complex.  Forty Creek has had better offerings."

3.75,Take off you hozer! This Canadian whiskey is nice. I am glad to get away from bourbon. This is just a clean smooth nicely rounded whiskey. Enjoyed my first glass and ready for round two.
4.0,"I really like Canadian whiskey and this one did not disappoint. When tasted neat, I enjoyed the full buttery/toffee flavor and oiliness which was very calming. Finished smooth and sweet with a hint of spice. This one is going on my x-mas list."

4.0,"Engaging caramel, with a suggestion of rye spice, the nose has a little too much raw alcohol notes, but it settles down with time. The taste is syrup sweet up front that settles into some spice and finishes with a bit of oak. This drink is a dessert in itself. With a little more age, it would shine brighter, but a really good example of the typical Canadian whisky style."
