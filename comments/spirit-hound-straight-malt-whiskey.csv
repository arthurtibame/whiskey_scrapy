3.0,"Tried at a local pub this week during a business trip to Denver.  $8/pour, quite expensive...not sure I’d buy again or buy a full bottle.  Didn’t really come across as “peated”, felt more like a light speysider instead.  Faint aromas of shortbread; palette is sweet, like corn candy with a touch of oak.  Interesting to try a local only whiskey."
