4.0,"Fantastic nose. Rich, lush, sweet. What you want all bourbons to smell like. Palate does not disappoint. Caramel, great spice, some citrus and a cream that lingers. Expensive, though perhaps the best Wild Turkey offering that's readily available today. 7/7/17"

5.0,"Wow the Russell boys really hit it out of the park on this one. Slightly higher alcohol on this compared to the 17. Starts with that traditional oak that smacks you in the face but at the same time doesn't overpower the pallet, releasing nicely into some sweet caramel and brown spices. Cinnamon on the finish along with some more smoked oak. Finish lasts for ever on this. A+ bourbon"

4.0,"The nose is first-rate. Savory, succulent, and sugar-coated. A great smelling bourbon all around. On the palate, there is a hint of caramel, baking spices, and a richness that endures but does not overtake. The cost might seem a little high for a Wild Turkey product. But, once you have your first taste, you’ll understand that the Decades is a cut above the rest of the lineup. 4.5/5."

I have to say that it's probably not worth the $$$$$ when you can buy Rare Breed or Kentucky spirit for less than a third of the price, but for true Turkey lovers and if you've got the pocketbook for it, I definitely recommend it."

4.0,"Nose - Oaky cherry vanilla cola, caramel, dark toffee, hint of leather, spicy cinnamon.

Taste - Spicy white pepper/cinnamon tingle, cherry/strawberry vanilla cola, light fruity oak, light leathery dryness, orange zest.

Finish - Lingering spicy cinnamon tingle, fruity vanilla caramels, hint of bitter fruity oak, light fruity bitterness like that of orange pith.

Score - 90/100

Final Thoughts - I quite like this one in that it has this fruity cola theme that I find quite interesting in a bourbon. I think this has a nice balance of old & older bourbons as it has the oaky, leathery feel of an older bourbon, but is cut back a bit by some more ""youthful"" 10 year so that it doesn't taste overoaked. Nice fruity/oaky balance that I think works quite well. Is probably best neat, but I can see this making a mean old fashioned with some barrel aged maple syrup & some cherry bitters.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes, if the price was right

Would I buy a bottle? - Maybe if I could find it closer to $100 USD"

5.0,"Typical bourbon nose with a not so typical bourbon taste. Silky smooth mouthfeel. A delicious balance of smoke, oak, vanilla, and red fruits. The subtle smokiness really sets it apart. Hardly any burn. Finish is a little on the short side but the balance of all flavors are always present. I seem to be hitting this bottle a lot; purchased a back-up bottle.

Not a fan of the price but it's so soft (like water) on the finish. Possibly dangerious?

Getting leather and slight sweetness - maybe butterscotch? on the nose. You can taste the oak and spice. A warm, light maple-y finish. Maybe even a slight hint of some cherry cobbler out the nose at the end. Fairly lengthy finish, but really pretty smooth. I’m really enjoying this (but again, perhaps lamenting the price a bit). High marks for taste!"

4.25,The nose is to die for. I'd want this in a candle in my house burning 24/7. Strong oak and burnt caramel on the nose. The palette is surprisingly lacking compared to the nose with the same oak and caramel with very strong cinnamon spice accompanying it through the finish. Super long and spicy finish leaves you warm and comfy.

It’s a well balanced bourbon that definitely doesn’t need any water. This is great, but not quite up to par with Old Fitzgerald, BTAC bottles or any of the intense oil-monsters I’ve sampled. 4.2."

5.0,This was real good
4.0,"The nose has a lot in common with the 17 year. It is maybe a little lighter, less herbal overall, and I get more mint. On the palate, the higher proof hits you immediately. The flavors aren't as concentrated as BTAC Stagg or W.L.Weller, but there is still a lot going on, so the burn is still pleasant. Let it linger too long in the glass neat, and peanuts show up (not my favorite). With water there is vanilla on the nose. The palate flattens out a bit, and the peanuts are more noticable. The finish remains cheerily warm."
5.0,Oak and pie crust on the nose.  Incredibly smooth and one of the longest finishes I’ve had with more oak and cinnamon toast

5.0,"Although the abv is 52% / 104 proof the nose wouldn’t recognize such a high proof. The mellow smell on the nose is appealing which makes me curious as to what exactly is in this mixture from an aging standpoint since its a NAS. I believe anything from 10 to 17 years if memory serves me correct. 

On the nose I instantly smell raisins, brown sugar and a subtle hint of cinnamon. 

On the tongue is a smoothness unlike their other products. The abv is heightened with a pinch of heat on the front to mid tongue. Spice comes out more dominant until you drink. No burn at all. Then again i drink regularly and especially whiskeys. Only a slight / subtle floral taste as well. 

To pay $150 USD for this product is worth it as i did so with two other friends. It is one of the top shelf items from a taste standpoint. A sipper to enjoy on special occasions. I would rate this a 4.5 out of 5, however, if the price were lower and the age was confirmed being 12-17 years it could easily be a 5 star. 

Cheers,"

4.5,"For me the Master’s Keep series is one of the most recognizable groups of whiskeys out there. With the exception of Forged Oak, no other whiskey I’ve ever had could possibly sneak in to this flavor group. So as my third tasted entry in that group, to an extent I knew what to expect.

Nose is heavy on caramel. Fainter scents are citrus, oak, and a mustiness that is universally present in the Master’s Keep group. It’s a great nose.

The first flavor I get is the caramel and citrus from the nose. Lemon, specifically. That fades away to a heavy hit of that mustiness that I get in all Russell’s Reserve and Master’s Keep products. It’s not my favorite flavor out there, but it’s not as harsh here as it is in RR. I could also call it part leather, part brine.

Finish is gentle in feel but spicy in flavor. I really like that, despite the fact that spicy finishes aren’t my favorite. It’s just interesting: there’s cinnamon and pepper, but it doesn’t feel as hot as you’d expect. That is elegant.

This doesn’t have room in my heart to be a favorite, but I respect the hell out of all the Master’s Keeps, this one included. My opinion, if these are in your price range, you should always give them a shot because they’re always expertly made and interesting. Revival is a true favorite of mine, 17 year remains one of the most complex bourbons I’ve ever had, and this one is the spicy one. All good in their own right, all deserve a chance."

3.0,Good. $130 good nope. Just get a bottle of Rare breed and thank me later.
4.75,"This is so darn good. The aroma on this dram steals the show and brings the distinct presence of aged whiskey through perfumed notes of antique wood and some leather. Unmistakable vanilla, caramel and baking spice are also present in the nose that are repeated in the flavors with adequate heat, barrel spice and an amazing finish."

3.0,"Decades.  I'm not sure which batch this is, i'm under the impression there were two and I also get the impression one was seen as the better and older option.  

Nose - had to really give this one some time, it's overwhelming when you first pour it.  You can already nose how thick the whisky is, it comes in at 104 proof but the nose has the body of something closer to 120.  I get rich caramel, citrus notes, cherry, some aged oak and then some younger more unfinished oak notes.  

Taste - I get that vanilla, leather, cherry oak that I often get with older whisky.  I'm actually amazed at how much this bottle seems to change each time I go back, each time it comes off a bit older than the last.  There's some sour notes, some fruity notes, and it finishes with a big puff of well behaved oak.  

Really good stuff, but I have to ask myself is it better than Rare Breed or Kentucky Spirit?  That's where this one somewhat drops off for me a bit.  I'm really not sure it is.  Really nice bourbon and I'm going 3 stars.  If you're ok with the 130, get it.  If you're not, get rare breed and you won't be getting all that different a bourbon.  Wild Turkey spoils us with just outstanding lower priced bourbons, but as a result their higher end stuff really doesn't punch any higher."

4.5,"Nose:  bigtime leather, tobacco, oak, cherries, fuji apple, a lil grassy, cinnamon, nutmeg...it's bright, spicy, and slightly funky ....hardly any alcohol fumes to speak of.

Taste:  More leather and tobacco, and a bit of funk...vanilla, charred oak, cinnamon, cherries, herbal, maple, almond skins...very rustic...it's a lot hotter on the palette than the nose.  Slightly oily mouthfeel.

Finish:  More leather, charred oak, vanilla, herbal, touch of mint, quite spicy...allspice-like...medium-long length

Empty Glencairn aroma:  Extremely funky...reminiscent of that brettanomyces band-aidy smell alond with maple syrup and oak.

Admittedly, I am more of a Scotch dude than a bourbon guy but this is right up my wheelhouse.  I tend to enjoy most WT products and this is the best of them that I have had the pleasure of having so far.  I'd even venture to say that it's definitely one of the best bourbons I have ever had.  It's quite rustic with a touch of funk without being overly sweet like a lot of bourbons can get.  It's a masterfully made whiskey.  Too bad it's so damn expensive.  Is it worth it?  That's for you to decide."

4.5,"Whisk(e)y: Wild Turkey Decades – Master’s Keep

The crème de la crème. I’ve been itching to sample this for quite some time now. In fact, it’s been a year since my last dram of this. 

The bottle has some good weight to it. The cork is comprised of a copper engraved top attached to the cork.  The front and left side of the bottle has the turkey blown into it. This has wonderful detail and is a great display piece during and after the contents are emptied.

When pouring this beauty into your glass it flows like water and seems quite thin for 52% ABV. If you’re new or not aware of why it’s called “Decades”, this is because the contents are different aged barrels ranging from 10 to 17 year bourbons. Alright – let’s get down to brass tax!

Nose: 

Right off the bat you can get a slight sense of corn and cinnamon / brown sugar. One thing I can’t pin point is the faint floral note. Could be mint leaf / grass. There is also a smell of toasted nuts...likely the oak barrel since it is aged with multiple blends of different maturations.

Palate:

First sip and swirling it around you get pronounced brown sugar. Leather comes into play as well. Very, very, very  few drams can perfect this and I dig what the Russell’s did here. Cinnamon follows along with a peppery spice. This definitely does not feel like 52% ABV. I personally find the finish quite short, but enjoyable. The front of the tongue feels the peppery heat and the taste buds get to dance around with the body of Decades.

Overall: 

Is it good? Yes!

Is it worth the price? Too much subjectivity – but if you live in an area where you cannot access this and will nurse it – get it!

Any Wild Turkey fan will enjoy this, however, if you have never tried any WT products before or haven’t sampled a variety of what they have to offer I wouldn’t recommend buying this. Decades I find is more polished and slightly complex. If you know the different tasting notes this would be something worth trying. If you are one to not care for picking notes out, I would then recommend sticking to Rare Breed or 101. I would restock this one personally. Damn good sauce!
