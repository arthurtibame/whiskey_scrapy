3.0,"The nose starts with linseed oil, honey, lemon, charred oak and a touch of caramel. The palate feels thin while the honey carries over along with a slight bit of the linseed oil, while charred oak finishes it. The finish is quick, with all flavors fading together while leaving behind a spicy mouthfeel."
