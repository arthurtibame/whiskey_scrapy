4.5,"Woodinville makes a great Bourbon to begin with. The port barrel treatment takes it up another half notch. Absolutely on the level of Angel’s Envy, maybe better."
4.25,"Intense aromas of cherry cola, plums and candy floss emerge on the nose. The spirit is smooth on the arrival, with classic caramel flavor along with the Port dark fruits. The mid-palate brings back the cherry cola, along with vanilla and cinnamon. Barrel spices and red wine round out the mildly dry finish - this is a craft bourbon with a very distinct profile with a lot to like at $60."
5.0,I usually dont like port cask finishes but this surprised me. definately lighter texture than their origional.

4.0,"Really nice, perfect dram for the holiday season. Lacks the spiciness that High West’s Midwinters Night Dram has, but still a very satisfying example of what port finishing can do. Shout out for o my brother for a very thoughtful Christmas gift!"

4.0,"Nose - Sweet dark fruity caramels, oaky vanilla, caramel corn.

Taste - Sweet tannic fruity caramel, vanilla, cinnamon spice, light bitter fruity spice, raisins/prunes steeped in a tannic red wine.

Finish - Lingering light fruity oak, light bitter spice, tannic/drying mouthfeel, sweet fruity caramel.

Score - 86/100

Final Thoughts - This was an interesting one as it took their already dark and lightly tannic bourbon and added this layer of sweet, fruity, tannic red wine to it. It's interesting for sure but at times it feels like they took a pretty wet tannic port cask to age this in as the color is quite dark. Nice bit of spice, but near the end of the palate it gets a bit bitter like if you oversteeped some tea. Interesting concept, loads of nice fruity vanilla caramels, but not sure if it's something I'd really reach for all that often.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - Unsure, if price was about $20 USD less"

4.0,"Mellow scent
Strong finish , not smooth to shoot"
3.25,"Very sweet... almost too sweet! This is so port forward, the classic corn, spice and oak notes take back seat. This is dessert."
4.0,"A sample as part of the ""Whiskey transfer program"" from dthom.

Nose:  Very sweet red wine and grapey notes like brandy hit my nose up front.  Dried dark fruits like figs and cherries as well as toasted pecan.

Flavor: Not as sweet as the nose suggests.  Ripe red fruits, caramelized sugars, vanilla, and more wine notes.

Finish:  Long finish that lingers.  Starts off with a little bit of spice and more toasted nuts and fades in to some dark caramelized wood tannins with baking spices then finally pencil shavings and more wine notes.

My favorite Port finished bourbon to date.  Complex with a lingering interesting finish.  Kind of sweet so I wouldn't start my night here but would maybe end a nice meal with this.  Definitely a good after dinner dram."
5.0,"Rich and sweet smelling, nice burn up front followed by lots of vanilla and fruit, especially cherry. Long and interesting cherry finish."

5.0,"Candied cherries on the front, giving way to subtle notes of dried plum and a hint of chocolate on the finish"
4.25,"After multiple tastings here is the Port finish review:
Nose: Carmel, jammy port, roast nut, corn dust and a boozy funk
Palate: creamy mouth feel, more port, a sour note, drying oak, powdered sugar 
Finish: okay, sour grape, black pepper, waxy Walnut and notes of PBJ. 
A very pleasant dram, would buy a backup bottle if I was local."
