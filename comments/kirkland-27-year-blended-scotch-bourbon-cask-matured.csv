4.5,"It’s been a while, but this bottle might have cost me less than it’s age statement. Definitely no more than $2/year, which is... interesting? Not a lot of stuff out there you can say that about.

Nose gives off raisin, grape must, and fig. Very standard yet tasty scotch nose. Body is surprisingly complex. Not surprising because of 27 years, or blended... but the Kirkland bit. I get heavy initial raisin and fig, which takes a sharp turn on the backend toward a bitter, wood and leather finish. Though the body is smooth like a scotch, the bourbon tongue feel is there in the finish as well.

I must admit, I had a very low set of expectations coming in. I’ve had Kirkland jeans. I’ve drank Kirkland beer. Let’s just say, you know what you’re getting into when you buy Kirkland. This was a true hidden gem for me.

I’m not sure exactly how big an audience this guy will have. It’s more bourbon than I’d want when I really crave a scotch, and it’s not enough bourbon forward when I want a bourbon. But damn it’s interesting. And when having the value conversation... this is honestly dirt cheap given its complexity."
4.5,"Smooth, unpeated, and delicious. Not overly complex, it has mild sweetness, and a medium finish with a delightfully subtle but blissfully lingering aftertaste. it’s a fantastic drinker. 

Bought a case."

4.0,"Dark amber color. Toasted pears, sherry and some light wood on the nose. Lightly sweet and woody with a thick, creamy mouthfeel and minimal burn.
A simple, solid, extremely pleasant Scotch sipper at a bargain of a price!"
