4.25,"Strong sweet nose of maple. Starts sweet but not overly. Chocolate and vanilla taste followed by a good oak and nutty taste. Finish is a little strong due to the higher proof but balanced well with just enough of a sweet finish. Overall, a nice complex variety of flavors. Well worth the taste."

4.75,"Rich and savory with plenty of nuts and raisins on the palette, burnt toffee on the nose. Despite being over 100 proof, it isn't particularly hot and sips very smoothly."
5.0,"After tasting a bunch of wonderful Deverons, Macduffs, and Aultmores, the Bacardi Malts rep brought open this bottle as the last drammers club pour as among the first in the US to ever try it. This stuff is amazing with notes of dark chocolate, white chocolate, raisins, toffee, vanilla, nuts, pepper, and old oak."
