3.25,"This was aired out for an hour in a rocks glass.  The resulting aromas were vanilla, apples, and cherry cinnamon. Cask strength caramels, butterscotch, and cherry pie laced with cinnamon were awash in ethanol % as the latter dominated the palate. The mesquite finish of the included Del Bac arrived as dark spice (just to let you know that this was no BBQ).  Some fennel and mint characteristics were discernible, as well.  The finish was oak dry (as is the norm with me when drinking higher-ABV whiskey) and concluded in a smoky, red hot cinnamon candies note.  

This left more of an impression of a seductive smoky rye, than a blend of single malts. With a second go, I added an ice cube. The nose was a teeny bit like a Highland scotch, and included a slight undertone of black licorice.  The palate from there began to resemble a bourbon, with fennel and star annise notes creeping in.  For my wheelhouse, this was not a one hit wonder but I can definitely see how this might work masterfully well when paired with a mild cigar...  

Cigar... I rarely smoke one, but when I do I keep remembering an event when an ex-girlfriend was running around her apartment like her poor a-- was on fire. When I wondered out loud, she replied with a one liner - there was way too much smoke for a one bedroom apartment.  Me - I kept huffing away.  I knew right then I didn't want to share a larger apartment.  In short, I wanted to love it as is, but the macho man in me stuck with the cigar experience."

4.5,"Prejudice.  Bias.  Racism. Discrimination.   Call it what you want, but it’s a black stain in human nature to have preformed unsubstantiated opinions based on nothing but conjecture.  We all do it, in little things or in larger things that hurt people. 10  Years ago, we went on vacation to Greece, where it was my wife, my then 1 1/2 yr daughter, and me.  We were taking the funicular from the top of the Santorini caldera to the bottom, by the shore.  In the funicular with us there was a single young man, middle eastern or Arabic descent. He made small broken English conversation with us.  But what was odd was he was holding a little Elmo doll.  He offered the Elmo doll to my daughter, who gleefully wanted to accept.  I absolutely refused.  Not because of any reason, except mistrust.  Why is a single guy carrying around an Elmo doll?  Why was he in the funicular car with us?  Why even make small talk when you can’t speak our language?  A few days later, we run into the same guy at a restaurant there in Santorini.  He’s working as a waiter.  He approaches us, and says immediately in broken English, “sir, I am so sorry for making you and your family uncomfortable that day.  It was not my intent.  I saw your little daughter and it reminded me of my little daughter back home in Iraq.  I had just bought her this doll, but I realized I couldn’t ship it to her anyway.  I wanted it to give it to your daughter, hoping to see her smile, and I can think what my girl would’ve done.  I am sorry”.   I felt 1 inch tall, especially when he showed us the picture of him and his family.  A highly educated dual advanced degree, non-white minority with  a really good living in the US, now making a prejudiced  call based on nothing but conjecture.  

That there leads me to this whiskey.  ( what a freakin stretch...), sent graciously by my buddy @jonwilkinson7309.  If you ever thought American craft whiskey can’t stand up to the best out of UK, India, or Japan, this here will set you straight.  It’s a blending genius at the level of Compass Box, but a fraction of their price.  Most folks write off blends as inferior to single malts, and an American blend...?  Seriously...?  Can’t be any good.  This is youthful, fiesty, and energetic.  Cherry pie, baking spices, and silky texture.  It took the best American craft , and made them better.  

If you see this, buy on sight.  I’m sure they’ll come out with batch 2...but who knows if it’ll be as good as batch 1."
4.5,"When the history of American single malt is written, this whiskey should be recognized as a milestone. Not just because it’s the first blend of its kind, but also because it marks the point at which the industry has the confidence and the supplies to craft a totem pole that says, “This is who we are.” It’s akin to that moment when Stan Lee and Jack Kirby decided to assemble Thor, Iron Man and Hulk into the Avengers and realized that there was no going back.

What Barrell has created here is a blend that as good as a Compass Box Scotch, yet distinctly American. It’s youthful and feisty without being uncouth. Let’s talk about the flavors: is there anything more American than cherry? The nose is ripe with it and it provides the backbone of the palate. It’s not an artificial candy cherry, either, but a delicious rounded one that is neither too sweet nor sour. There’s clove too, particularly on the finish, which is long and spicy and untainted by any of the feints or green notes that tarnish much of the younger craft spirits. The body is silky and fruity and drinks way below its strength. It tastes and feels sophisticated and integrated. It’s more than the sum of its parts.

If you see this offered at a bar, give it a try. Just don’t go where I did, at least not on a Friday night when 100 people are competing for the attention of two sullen servers who forget your order and then assume they can keep the significant amount of change from the bills you tendered. Whiskey, served sour."

4.5,"Barrell Vatted American Malt is one of my most anticipated releases of the year! I love everything these guys put out! This one is a blend of single malts from the following distilleries:

Balcones Distillery, Waco, Texas
•    Hamilton Distillers Del Bac, Tucson, Arizona
•    MGP, Lawrenceburg, Indiana
•    Harvest Distillery, Valatie, New York
•    Santa Fe Distillery, Santa Fe, New Mexico
•    Kings Country Distillery, Brooklyn, New York

Bottled at Cask Strength (117.5 proof) and unfiltered. I'll keep it short, I flat out love this. Lots of classic American Malt notes (apples, pears, honey and toffee) with Del Bac Dorado providing some wonderful complexity with it's smoke and acting as the backbone of this blend (it's also the largest component of this blend). 

It's an incredibly unique dram that I just cannot put down. It's not for the faint of heart but for my friend's on here who love the Del Bac Dorado I strongly suggest you seek this one out! 

Cheers all!"
