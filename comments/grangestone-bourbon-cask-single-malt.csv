4.0,"Potent yet refined. Added six drops of water to open the flavor and immediately enjoyed the smooth oak flavor. Had great conversation around Scotch and the Scotland distilling process. For the money, worth it."
4.0,Not too strong but not too light. Smooth.   Added 3 drops of water.

3.0,I found this to be just ok.  It has a very fruity type finish on the end.  Almost like the taste of a pear.  Not enough bite or smokiness for me.  Would I drink it again....yea.  Would I buy it again...no.

4.0,Vanilla hits the palette first with fruit and floral notes through the middle and finishes like a bourbon with a perfect amount of peat at the finish.  Great deal for the money.
4.0,Finished in a bourbon cask. Good taste for the price

3.0,"Smooth and easy to sip. May not be the most sophisticated scotch out there, but enough flavor to make it interesting. Little to no peat or smoke. 

A week ago I would have said I don’t like scotch, and would stick to bourbon. This was enjoyable enough to change my mind."

This is pretty good for what I am assume is a very young whisky. Probably a good buy for the money. Reminds me a lot of Rebel Yell Bourbon. Lots of bourbon character with no trace of corn sweetness."

3.0,"Very drinkable, lacks complexity, could use more age but that would increase the price. QPR is good for this entry level scotch. Enjoy neat or with a single cube, but don’t get carried away. It will work as a filler in between the more refined options. It’s a scotch that wishes it was a bourbon, the spicy heat of an American bourbon with just a puff of smoke to let you know it’s a scotch. Buy"

2.5,"On the nose, a lot of oak spice. Cherry and dark chocolate as well. 

Taste wise, Cherry and Dark chocolate continue to have a large presence. Oak as well. Also hints of apple. 

Finish is a little rough. Lot of ethanol and burn at the end. 

Solid whiskey."
