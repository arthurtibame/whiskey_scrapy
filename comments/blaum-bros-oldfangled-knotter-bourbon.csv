4.5,Nose has a medicinal note but flavor is outstanding and complex. Nice finish. Flavor is better than the nose. Solid bourbon.

4.0,Less burn than expected for a cask strength. Notes of creamy vanilla and dried fruit.
4.0,"Worked very well in a maple old fashioned...went heavy on the bourbon and was still smooth, no burn, and made me want another."

4.0,"Non-store pick 114.8 proof, 10yr

Nose: caramel, nutty, alcohol, woody
    
Palate: cloves, peanuts, smooth caramel
    
Finish: lingers a while and tastes similar to the flavors in the palate, and then ends with a cough syrupy taste."
4.0,"8/10.  11 Year Kenwood Liquors Pick.  Bubblegum, vanilla, and Cherry on the nose.  Deep , rich molasses MGP flavor.  Vanilla and maple, with a good heat.  Nice burn on the finish with oak and caramel."
