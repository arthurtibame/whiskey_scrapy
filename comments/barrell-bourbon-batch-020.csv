5.0,"Wow is this stuff smooth!! I was expecting it to be much hotter because of the ABV but not the case at all. That being said, I do prefer full proof bourbons but this one blew my mind. Not only is it ultra smooth but it is packed with flavor. I bought myself this batch and batch 21 for my brother as a gift, glad I did so I can try both. I will being trying more of these for sure!"
