4.0,"Like a slightly smoother Macallan 12.  Nose sniffs of citrus, caramel, and a hint of maltiness that blends into the pallate.  From there, dried fruit and a substantial sherried taste emerge.  Finish is pleasant, though subdued.  

Settles in nicely with a couple drops of water.  First couple sips neat seem like just a Mac 12.  As you continue to explore the glass, it is something clearly better."

5.0,"Sweet vanilla and mulled pears dominate the aromas, with a touch of Golden Graham's. Also a hint of allspice and toffee in the background. Honey comes through more on the palate with a more floral note then expected. I'm glad this is 43% alcohol, or it would be rather less robust. Distinctly the older sister of The Balvenie 12 Doublewood. But with age comes wisdom and refinement. A great all around dram."

4.0,"This was a nice one.  Now - worth the $130 plus price?  Hmmmm - not sure.  I'm right on the edge of saying yes.  The scent says this is gonna be sweet - really intoxicating smells which I loved taking in.   The taste though has some depth that goes beyond just sweet.   It's got some heat to it.  A drop or three of water opened up some of the flavors for me.  

For me this trick is what song describes this - and the perfect match to this musically for is a nice Hawaiian song - something from Israel Kamakawiwo'ole would do nicely.  

The soul and emotion compliments the Balvenie approach of ""wood and malt"" - great care has gone into this dram and it shows."

1.0,"Balvenie 17 : Double Wood, a single malt scotch whisky hailing from the Speyside region. Had this one from a sampler package. Sampled 1/10/16 with 1 teaspoon of water in a Glencairn spirits nosing glass.
  
  Aroma - Wood sap to start, very resinous, baked apple, bittered honey, distant rye, burnt sugar cookie, marzipan and roasted peanuts, a decently promising nose but...
  
  Taste - Butter, cherry lozenges, very faint sherry and wood bittering, incredibly flat and one dimensional.
  
  Finishes with a quickly fading flavor and medium lingering burn.
  
  Final score : 1.5 / 5, for what a one-dimensional and non-complex whisky this is, the 95+ price point it commands is not at all worth the product you're getting. The 17 years this whisky has spent maturing has not done much justice to the overall product. You could get much similar flavor profiles from far cheaper whisky. Not to say the whisky itself is inherently nasty to the taste, but my scoring is based as well on the price asked, and the price and flavor here, do not line up."

3.0,"I'm beginning to think I must just be a bourbon guy, because I cannot justify the price point on some of the single malts I've tried lately. This is another installment in the sample collection I received as a gift this Christmas. 

I jotted some notes while tasting and compared them to my review of the Balvenie Doublewood 12-year from a few months back. It definitely has some  similarities. 

On the nose, I picked up some cherry vanilla ice cream, orange pekoe tea with lemon and a dusting of cinnamon. The palate expressed the grain in a more biscuit like fashion as opposed to the cereal notes I found in the 12. Some spice and dried fruit are there, along with that faint wisp of pipe smoke. The finish is a bit longer, with moderate burn and a slight bitter edge that isn't unpleasant. Dry glass is pipe tobacco. 

In all, it is good, but not great. A 750 mL bottle costs US $137.99 locally, more than double the cost of the 12-year Doublewood (at $55.99) and only $2 less than Highland Park 18. For a nice, drinkable dram, the 12 is a much better value in my opinion. Or perhaps I am missing something."

Having said that, the way in which the green apple, honey and almond aromas came together was extremely balanced. And the finish... remarkably smooth. For a whisky lover who is inclined towards Speyside whiskies, this is perhaps your quintessential dram and definitely should be a part of your core collection. Otherwise, try it once for the experience and move on."

4.0,"* Scotland, September 2017. Whisky #10. also
* Sydney Balvenie whisky tasting night, 26 April 2018. Whisky #3.

Nose: Sherry, caramel, vanilla, dark fruits, dusky orange, old rose, incense and apricot jam.

Palate: A soft arrival with warm spices swimming in creamed honey. The development brings forth dried fruits (raisins, figs, medjool dates), sweet nuts (almonds, hazelnuts, macadamias), crème brûlée, soft oak, chocolate, and sweet milk coffee.

Finish: Medium/long. Sherry, chocolate and creamy toffee.

I first tasted this at a hotel bar in Scotland last year and whilst it was enjoyable it did not make a huge impression. However having re-tasted it tonight I was very pleasantly surprised. Maybe tasting it comparatively in a flight of 6 whiskies made the difference or maybe the dram at the bar was from an old opened bottle - who knows.

This is very obviously the older and more poised brother of the 12 year double-wood. It is more complete and has a layered complexity that is not present in the 12 year old, but it is still cut from exactly the same cloth.

The palate is similar but both spicier and smoother - very mellow and mature. It's altogether a more sophisticated dram and it is worth paying almost twice the price. Adding a little water brings out the sweet notes and puts emphasis on the vanilla aspect. A fine and satisfying representative Speysider of the sherried persuasion.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

The 17 really does jump to a new level after 5 years, but I’m still not quite sure it’s worth twice the price of the 12.

null,"I love the 12 year double wood, I also enjoy the price- then I tried the 14 and then 15: not worth the hundred clams- they both have a spice that I wasn’t wild about, it’s like a young bourbon spice that hits you in the back end- enjoyable? Sure, but didn’t get me “turned on” by the aging smoothness in a way that many other scotches do (macallan does a great job of this). On to the 17- same spice, just amplified. I’m really glad I didn’t but this bottle and only went with the pour. It has many nice characteristics of scotches, like chocolate and baking spices, .. but I feel this one misses the mark with value- the spices are peppery and youthful, it seems more like the kind of spice nestled into a really peaty young scotch ;minus the peat. The smoothness is only apparent upon the whisky first entering your mouth and then the spice ramps up and overthrows many of the subtleties and even the finish. 🤷🏼‍♂️"

4.5,"Nose is raisins, cherries, plum, berries and cream, very sweet

Palate is deep and rich, with more of the plum and berries, some wood and dark chocolate

Finish is long oily, the wood shows up more with slight char, but still tasting plum and raisins"

4.5,"After drinking the Balvenie 12 Doublewood I can say that the 17 DW lives up to its reputation.

In the 12 you experience a nose of Vanilla, Grapes (which was nice), Nuts and Honey.

In the 17 you nose Vanilla for sure. The expert taster say's ""orchard fruits"" which I find hard to grasp but i sense a slight slight musk smell which this could depict. i also can pick out the honey as you enter the mid to end nose when this becomes present.

Tasting this dram I get the honey and chocolate shavings taste. It's subtle, but there. 

This dram is 43% abv which is a nice improvement from the 12 yo version. Although it's not a big difference, it was a well needed increase to give more variety on the tongue.

Pricing of this bottle is too much. I paid rougly $175 CND after conversion from the US due to this being on someone's shelf for a while. To buy this at the LCBO in Ontario, Canada you'll be paying $299 which is too much money. I really enjoy this dram and can say it's top notch, but paying $299 CND i'm pretty confident there are other options out there just as refined but have a lower price tag. Snag it if you're a collector, but anything more that 2 racks is a waste of denero."

Entry is creamy, with green apples, cherries, graham crackers and figs. Some spice as well. Finish is meduim to short with vanilla and oak. Lovely pour, much richer than the 12 yr. 
Glad to have tasted this one! Cheers all!"

The alcohol burn is more prevalent then might be expected at 43%, but the aftertaste is wonderful with the golden honey lingering in a lovely fashion."

3.0,Too woody for my taste. I admit it has a different taste than most of regular whisky.
4.25,"I came across this at an airport lounge during a layover, having waited to try it until I could find a place to sample it without needing to gamble on an entire bottle. It’s been on my list for a while and I wasn’t disappointed. 

It seems impossible to try the 17 yo without comparing it to the 12 yo release. The nose is more muted and restrained than it’s younger sibling’s.  On the palate, it’s more spice-driven than the 12, with vanilla, amber honey, dried fruits, and Christmas baking spices dominating. The finish is long and tends towards dry, where more of the spice and wood elements prevail. 

Overall, I prefer the 17 yo as a smoother, richer, and more robust dram than the 12 yo. Very enjoyable after-dinner (or holiday) selection. 

4.25 ~ 90-92 ~ Excellent"

Oakiness is in full brute force, which is undercut by sweet maltiness.  The finish is creamy, but still overpowered by the oak/tannins and the signature Balvenie maltiness lingers.  Not complex, nor interesting."

4.25,"Last of my Balvenie sampler pack. Poured neat, thick glasscoat leads nose of dense malt and subdued yet rich fruit with soft wood and absolutely no hint of ethanol. Inhale all you want its just not there. Palate is blend of malt,fruits and wood with spices and honey aged to a degree of silky smoothness that is just wonderful. Long finish of more malt (still rich) and polished wood with mild peat coffee note and lingering spice. Dries out a bit but not bitter. This is another magnificent scotch. Of course you have to pay for the 17 year privilege. I would not pony up with the 14 year available for much less but hey if you got it you cant take it with you. Regardless of price this is fantastic scotch..........94/100...........minor deduction for value"

I tasted this as part of a sampler pack with the 12 double cask and the 14 Caribbean cask.  The 17 was significantly better than the other two to me.  The 17 is similar to the 12 but with more intense, and complicated flavors, and a longer finish.  The 14 Caribbean rum cask is a different creature with its rum nose and taste."

Nose: Very similar to the 12 year Doublewood but quite a bit more barrel oak notes, more char, and heavier on the vanilla and sugars.

Flavor:  Delicious!  A vanilla and honey bomb followed by dried cherries and figs.  Buttery and thick mouth feel as well.  

Finish:  Medium length with more dark sugar and a little bit of baking spices with some spice and quite a bit of oak and some sherry funk.

My favorite sherry finished single malt to date.  This is way more refined and polished than the 12 year."

4.0,"Didn't get big distinctive notes on the nose, a decent, caramel and sweetness. Hits a little harder than I expected in the front. Big spice with some raisin and soft fruit tones. Spice at the front ended up drowning kind of harsh though. The finish really saves it. Spice falls away and you get that nice, creamy vanilla oak that lingers nicely. The finish makes me think it deserves another big drag until I get that spicy front again. Not normally a water guy but I did find a couple of drops helps cut the aggressiveness at the front a bit (seems obvious)"

3.0,"The nose has a bit more richness, harshness, and maltiness than the Balvenie 21 Port does, with less fruit and floral notes. The palate is disappointingly not as viscous as expected and it tastes a tad off somehow. It is, however, sweet with some nice fruity notes that bring in the cherry from the Sherry and also a bit of rum molasses and cinnamon (oddly enough). The light body contributes to a feeling that this scotch is a tad restrained. It tastes scotchy, but also has some we'd wood flavor that is a bit like cardboard, but also skirts it a bit. The spices are rich and sweet without being overly harsh, though they are a bit numbing. It does have some holiday baking spice character to it for sure. Some light vanilla and floral notes come out. It's a bit richer than the Balvenie 21, but otherwise isn't quite as good aside from a reduced wet cardboard presence. Still, it's about on the same level as the Balvenie 21 all told. It's tasty enough that it could be sipped, though it wouldn't be my first choice. The caramel tastes like it's trying to become butterscotch, but it doesn't quite make it. This qualifies maybe as barely a sipper, but it's not something I'd go out of my way to get. The little bit of smoke adds some bitterness, which is nice at offsetting the sweeter, milder notes, but is more of a char than a complex smoke. On net, it's a positive though. It's fine, but thoroughly unexciting."
