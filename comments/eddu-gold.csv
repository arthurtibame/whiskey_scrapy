3.0,"Operation 'Clean out the crap' has commenced. First I herded all sub par crap into a pile. 30 most likely average/sub par samples into one pile with an occasional sprinkle of good drams I've already tried... the remaining 100 should be pretty good ones. 

Like my son who even at 5 is a big believer in delayed gratification (always eats the stuff he hates first and saves any treats he gets for an absurdly long time - seriously how many kids can holding off eating a stock pile of lollies for weeks?), I to am a big believer in tackling anything I don't want to do as soon as possible like painting the bathroom and ripping up the carpet today. I annoy my wife intensely by cleaning all the dishes and cooking utensils as we go sometimes before she's even finished with them..

Anyhow that was a very long winded way of saying this was a chore to drink. It was unusual and the completionish in me couldn't help but buy a sample...but I knew it'd be at best average and it was.

The nose smelled like when you open a sterile medical supply, iodine but not in a good Laphroaig way. The palate wasn't terrible just odd..light sweet something or other. I think after tonight's run my sink is going to throw up..but rather it than me and my stomach..."
