5.0,"This was an impulse buy on Christmas Eve and turned out to be my favorite bourbon of the year.  Peach and apricot jams and full, viscous mouth feel.  Easy sipper even at 111.2 proof.  Lacks heat, bitterness and high spice and I'm OK with that."
3.0,Sweet and slightly bitter. Some floral and herbal notes. Pleasantly warm. 10/12/18

3.0,"Herbs and apples on the nose. Some alcohol sting. Very spicy up front, then nutmeg and marshmallows. Some furniture polish. If you like spicy and sweet, this is a winner. Lingering cinnamon gum and pecan nibs. Nice. 6/7/18"

4.0,Hot and spicy. Woody tannic qualities come thru with a few drops of water. Cherry chocolate and maybe some nutty characteristics show thru. Finish is long and hot with cherry almond tones.

3.5,A good full flavored bourbon. Very fruity. Just a little over priced for what you get.

4.25,not the right bottle but closest I could find. having a 14yr cask strength barrel pick 111proof
4.0,"Hot corn and hay on the nose. 
Semi-oily mouthfeel with corn, wood, cherry cola, citrus and vanilla on the palate. The palate honestly changes on every sip. 
A couple drops of water adds lemon pledge on the nose and additional citrus/fruitiness on the palate. 
I went into this review assuming I’d type something like “it’s not worth the price tag” at the end. But honestly, it’s a nice bourbon. I suppose it depends on what you expect to pay for a solid, cask strength bottle."

3.75,"Dark Amber in color. The nose is strong honey and vanilla with a fresh oak scent. You need to let this high proof bourbon sit before doing nosing it much less tasting it. The palate give you full bodied mouth feel viscous, peppery and sweet. The finish is a little astringent and hot, but quick to dissipate. Not as good as how it smells or tastes."
3.5,"Smooth, Cherry, honey and nuts. Nice lingering heat on the backend."
