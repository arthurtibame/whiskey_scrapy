3.5,I'm not a big eye fan but this one surprised me. Tart cherries and vanilla greet you and lead into a peppery finish that lingers. Definately enjoyed.

3.5,"Something new! Light, sweet, nice flavor. A little lightweight, but good complexity. A little touch of cedar, some rye spice, super approachable. I like it a lot better than the old forester rye. This would be an easy four-star pick for me if it was a 100 proof. It just needs a little more age & horsepower"

2.5,Not much of anything. Definitely not worth the price.
