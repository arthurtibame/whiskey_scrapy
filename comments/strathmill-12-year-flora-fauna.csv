2.5,"Nose: A cereal-forward nose with a little vanilla and a strong malty background. Sweet and full, there are hints of apple, honey and caramel.

Palate: Rich, sweet, silky-smooth arrival. Brown sugar and malt, vanilla, custard, hazelnuts. As it develops a little cocoa comes to the front.

Finish: Medium. Sweet and cereal/malty.

Like Teaninich 10 year, this whisky put me very much in mind of Johnnie Walker. I'd bet good money it is a component of their blends but this one probably goes into Black Label more than Red Label.

It's enjoyable and easy to drink, with the only negatives being a slight lightness of weight and a faintly metallic mineral / herby note that creeps in at mid-development. This lingers right through until the end by which time it's almost a saccharine taste and disturbingly reminiscent of lower tier grain whisky.

Adding water is not recommended. The nose loses all coherence and turns into pear-juice and the palate simply falls apart. This whisky can't swim to save itself.  The only positive thing about watering is that the aftertaste is muted.

It's rather expensive for the quality and only worth obtaining if you are aiming to taste the whole Flora & Fauna series.

""Average"" : 2.5 stars"
3.0,"We had a pour of this at the tasting bar upstairs at Oban Distillery, which has a pretty solid selection of Diageo's single malt lineup particularly their Flora & Fauna series. 
 Strathmill is almost exclusively a blending component, and I can see why here.  This is a solid malty base that will allow other whiskies to perform the starring role in a blend.  Released as part of the Flora & Fauna line, this is a solid session dram but nothing more.  The nose is a classic generic Highland nose of mild honey, oats, and moderate minerality.  The palate is sweet, like skipping straight ahead to dessert and enjoying an apple pie and a glass of sherry."
3.5,This really is a whiskey of two halves. The good rich viscous honey and vanilla. The not so good shorter slightly bitter finish. Initially the longer I drank it the latter seemed to over power the former but then it balanced out a bit.  3.5 rounding up as I don't like to disrespect the dead (aka discontinued) :-)

4.0,"I find myself surprisingly liking this whisky, and I'm impressed by its complexity: brewed tea, lemon peels, the faintest hints of smoke, and what I can only describe as a bowl of Corn Flakes with granulated sugar sprinkled on it - quite delicious. The finish is likewise robust and satisfying."
