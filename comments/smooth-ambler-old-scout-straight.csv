4.0,"Classic bourbon notes on the nose with sweet cherries and vanilla, though it’s a bit harder to find. 
On the palette it’s immediately very sweet and the cherries and corn sweetness are super prominent. Then, the sweetness falls away and the whisky becomes very dry and dusty, which I actually like. Short finish."

3.5,"The return of SAOS, still MGP sourced with no age statement but supposed to contain 5 year juice. On to the review:

Pretty weak nose, with some creamed corn, pipe tobacco, and vanilla through a thin layer of alcohol. Not particularly inviting, but not off-putting either. 

Palate opens with caramel, vanilla, and butterscotch. Good things are happening...wait...what's that in the mid-palate? Yikes! An astringent, earthy mint and pencil shavings that wipes out the initial sweet flavors entirely. 

Finishes with cinnamon and burnt oak trailing off into a kind of bittersweet chocolate which is nice. Finish is short. Mouthfeel is neither chewy nor watery, and is appropriate for the proof. 

Overall this is a weird one because it starts well and ends well, but the mid-palate experience ruined it for me. Maybe it's the young age coming through or maybe it's always this earthy at any age, but I found it to be very unbalanced and overall not my jam. Hard to recommend at $43"

3.75,"Neat. Batch One. Vanilla and caramel for miles on the nose.  Hint of oak and fresh grass and spearmint.

Nice thick mouth feel.  Lots of brown sugar and cinnamon up front.  Then the vanilla and cinnamon linger to the end. 

It’s solid but I can’t help to think it would be amazing with a few more years."
