4.0,"A wonderful spicy bourbon for the price.  Similar to Fighting Cock, just aged longer.  On my short list of daily pours."
2.0,Strong and not that great with coke.
2.0,"A great value. The nose is sweet with lots of alcohol. The taste is full of corn sweetness, cinnamon, black pepper spice, and oak. The finish is slightly bitter with a lot of alcohol. A 7 year old bourbon at 101 proof, for $12, is great any day of the week."

3.5,This was the well whiskey at a nice cocktail bar in town and for the cheap price this is a great value. They suggested getting this for around $8 a pour compared to the other name brand whiskeys above $10. I think it was a good suggestion.
3.5,"Butterscotch on the nose, all day long. The palate is sweet too, but perplexingly it has a tropical fruit feel, like papaya. It’s hot and not-at-all smooth, oaken astringency playing an outspoken role. The burn turns to vanilla extract as it coats the tongue. The finish is pretty versatile. Tonight I get shoe polish along with the oak and the tropical fruit. All I ever wanted in a bourbon. Thanks to Tom from Philly for the tip."

3.0,"Lots of Barrell in this one. Heavy char on nose and finish.  Slightly sweet front, some smoke.  
Excellent value, but a bit rough around the edges for a neat drink"

4.0,"$25 for 1.75L. Yeah, this is a 4-star bourbon. Too bad it just lost its age statement 😥"

4.0,"When I open the bottle my nose was enveloped in straight up fresh cinnamon buns!

The palate is rich and dense, some good vanillas and cinnamon.

Finish was medium length

Freaking delicious.

3.0,"Probably shouldn't comment on a bourbon after drinking all night, but here we go.  Been wanting to try this because apparently this is one of the few reasons to visit Alabama, and since I happen to live here, thought it would be nice to experience it.  However the age statement has changed from 7 years to NAS.  Don't know how the 7 year tastes so this isn't a comparison, simply a taste of the NAS.  It's simple and smooth all the way.  There is a burnt sugar sweetness with a very mild fruit taste, maybe cherry,  with a very mild burn, especially for a 101 proof.  Very smooth all the way, leaving you with a sweet mild burn at the end.  For under $15 this has to still be a good reason to visit AL."
3.5,Tons of vanilla and maple syrup. Lucky to find the age stated in NC.

3.25,"Nose: ethanol, caramel, 

Palate: spice, dry maple syrup, thick, ethanol again

Finish: dry maple syrup and short"
3.5,"Mint and barrel notes on the nose.  Clear whiff of rye grain, although I’ve assumed this is not a high rye mash.  Orange-brown in the glass.  Oily legs.

Menthol, dark chocolate, and oak course throughout the taste.  Green apple, barrel char.  Generously spiced from both flavor and proof.  Not overly sweet but has undertones of toffee.  The first few sips have a slightly mildewed undertone, as if the charring didn’t entirely cleanse the open-air aged staves.  The chocolate + apple edges toward bitter/sour cocoa, but thankfully all that eventually fades, letting the deep chocolate-y flavors, oak, and bold spice occasionally harmonize in a way I usually associate with some very high-end products.

Astringent finish that keeps tingling for a while with mint chocolate notes.

A less common profile that can both delight and challenge, but realistically for $13/L this is a knockout.  Price has jumped in the last 6 months up to a ~$20 bottle which is less of a steal as well as going NAS... direct competitor with the outstanding VFM WT101, which I’d probably pick over this aside from the scarcity factor/mystique.

If anything, this is a touch over-oaked and I almost get the feeling that these were quick-aging barrels intended for Evan Williams Black Label that were bought on the cheap (accordingly) but continued aging to release with better “stats” and the result is mixed - a bit disjointed but some clear successes as well."

3.0,"Just as others have stated, a great everyday sipper when you add a little splash."
3.0,"Smells sweet, tastes hearty, spicy, sweet, nice burn, alcohol is present but not overpowering.  Very good at an even better pricepoint."
3.0,"**EDIT: It's rumored that this is the export version of Old Ezra 7 Yr. Now that the foreign market is a little more discerning, they're dumping these in many states where the Old Ezra is not available.**A great value in the $13 range. You can definitely taste the Heaven Hill lineage here. Sweet toffee,  butterscotch, and peanut brittle upfront. Hot and oaky on the back end, but a splash or a cube brings out some good smoky, chocolaty notes and calms the finish just enough. This is going into my rotation of value pours."
4.0,"Yes, a four star bourbon for only $13.49 (Virginia). This bourbon came highly recommended.  I could easily compare this to some high-end bourbons on the market with a $60 price tag.  The sweet vanilla taste with a hint of cigar smoke is right on the pallet.  Open it up with a melted ice cube and you've got yourself a smooth bourbon."
2.0,"Good flavor upfront, Sweet and mildly citrusy. Aftertaste reminds you why this is a cheap bottle but overall it's hard to beat the price. Honestly, it's more of a daily sipper than mixer for me. If you can find it, defintly buy it. I just found 750ml for $16 and 1.5L for $23."

3.5,"This is a strange bourbon.  Most people have never heard of or even seen because it was mainly a exported bourbon.  Now you can find this only in a few states, Alabama, Kansas, Mississippi, and North Carolina. This is a 7 year old bourbon that clocks in at 101 proof and is about $15 dollars. The color is a dark amber with a reddish hint. The nose is brown sugar, vanilla, corn, and oak.  The taste is the same as the nose but has a very strong oak flavor.  The finish is medium to long with the oak and some spiciness lingering.  This is a Heaven Hill product and now that the Heaven Hills 6 year bottled in bond has been discontinued, this might just be a great replacement."
1.75,"Light nose. One note on the palate, short finish. 6/21/19"

3.5,"Bold and spicy. A bit of cherries and oak. The finish is not long, but its a nice one. Good color. The smell is stronger than the taste will be. Solid for the price."

3.75,"Virgin 101 7 Year
Sampled in a Glencairn, the color is amber tending toward orange. A quick swirl yields skinny, oily and slow-moving legs.
*Nose: Dusty Corn, Orange Peel, a Musty/Dusty Oak note with a little alcohol sting.
*Neat: Hot and Slightly Bitter on entry with Vanilla Sweetness showing up mid-palate. The Orange Peel note dominates the slightly hot finish with a healthy dose of Cinnamon for good measure. Fairly thick and chewy mouthfeel with a decent Kentucky Hug. Slightly Bitter Oak and Cinnamon coat the palate after a medium length finish.
*Splash: Adds an unidentifiable sweetness and a grassy note to the nose. Really helps the palate by making the Vanilla and Cinnamon notes a little more dominant start to finish. Also adds a touch of Chocolate. As an interesting side note, the nose on the empty glass was a dead ringer for Big Red Gum.
*Verdict: 7 Year Old, 101 Proof Heaven Hill Whiskey for around $13-$15?  Enjoy it while (and if) you can, folks. Put this in a pretty bottle and it could easily pass for a $30-$40 Bourbon. Instead, it's the best $13 Bourbon on the market, by a long shot. Not available everywhere, but if you can find it you will not be disappointed."
3.5,"@Damon_Elliot gave me a pour of this and if he’d told me this was a $40 or $50 bottle, I wouldn’t have questioned it. It has a fantastic smoky heartiness to it while still being very smooth and sippable. I’m a fan, especially for the value!"
