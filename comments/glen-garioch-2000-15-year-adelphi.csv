4.25,Strong up front. Very fruity.
4.25,"This was the fourth of 10 Adelphis I tried in one evening and the first Glen Garioch I’ve tasted. The nose is fruity and slightly funky, though not as much as some Springbanks. Surprisingly easy to drink at cask strength, it’s rich and creamy, with notes of apples and stone fruits. One of two bottles of the night that I might realistically buy and reasonably priced at $100-120."
