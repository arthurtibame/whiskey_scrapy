4.0,Very smooth
5.0,"As any Amrut fan will tell you, 7 years for Amrut is not young.  As a huge fan of the Indian malt I was ecstatic with all the tropical and cola flavors, but it had a subtlety with the macallan and glen Elgin that really smoothed out all the rough brashness Amrut can deliver in its own.  To me it's a really cool idea and I was all over it. I think any Amrut fan should check this out for themselves if you want something unique."
