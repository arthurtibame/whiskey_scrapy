1.0,"Can't recall if this was 50 or 60 so I won't  place a price but it's in that ball park.  

Nose - It's an incredible light nose.  I get a bit of grass, lightly toasted oak, hints of vanilla.  I'm getting that aspartame note I get often from vanilla and young oak notes.  I'm getting a fruit note i can't place here.  It's light, perhaps tropical, .

Taste - This might be the least descriptive bourbon I've ever had.  It's bourbon...  It's light, touch of fruity notes maybe, some vanilla and caramel and oak...you know bourbon, but nothing is strong.  The alcohol in my chest is actually the most noticeable moment in this and even that isn't much.  The oak maybe stands out over the sweet notes to give you an idea of what this is.  

Overall there's nothing good, nothing bad, nothing bold, but it's not water.  More alcohol kick than I'd expect on a 44% but again it's nothing off putting either.  There's I guess enough oak where I can buy the 10 years but boy oh boy did this not get much out of the 10 years, it might have been better younger with a bit less oak to be honest.  

1 star - it's bourbon.  You don't want this but if someone pours it you'll have no problem enjoying it if you like bourbon.  There's countless options cheaper and better.  There's countless options better and more expensive.  But it's 2019 while quality standards are down from the better years, very few people put out BAD whisky.  So with so much decent bourbon why pay a premium for boring decent bourbon?"

2.75,"It’s bourbon. Very sweet bourbon. For 31 bucks, seems okay. Would be offended if I bought it for $60. 

Overwhelming tasting note is sweetness. Sweet vanilla nose. Sweet vanilla palate. Sweet vanilla finish, with a bit of drying oak. Not a lot of complexity. Surprised it’s a 10 year. 

The only off-putting thing for me was the watery mouthfeel. Very thin. Otherwise, a decent bourbon if your palate leans sweet."
