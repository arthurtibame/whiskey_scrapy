4.25,Smells and tastes like smoked meat.  Like a charcuterie platter in a bottle.

4.75,"Another bottle I feel the urge to give it some justice... Just one rating so far and far too low for the quality of this whisky.

Tasted almost a year ago so I don’t have precise tasting notes but remember being some points above the 2017 Jazz Ed., that was already a great bottle.

More creamy & sweet and less sooty and peaty than the 12 series, this one probably have some Oloroso cask in the mix and/or some kind of wine finish. I also could bet that the average age of this one is older.

As per the Ledaig 13 review, I promise detailed tasting notes as soon as I open my bottle. 

4.75 for now, but I have the feeling I’ll change this for a full 5 stars after trying it again."
