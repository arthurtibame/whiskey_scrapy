3.75,"One of the better 4 year BiB’s I’ve had. I prefer it to their wheated offering. Not complex, but straightforward and clean.

WT claims their sweet mash method reduces the harshness you expect from a young contender and I’m sold."

3.5,"Spicy, reminded me of a Woodford Reserve. Good flavor."
4.0,"Smells sweet, like caramel. Not oily and not too spicy. It’s actually pretty good. I liked it more as I kept drinking it. It’s easy to drink. I think it would be a good mixer."
3.75,"Smells like maple, caramel. Taste not match smell. Not butter mouth."

4.25,"The nose on this is absolutely killer; vanilla custard, torched caramel, graham cracker, pumpernickel bread, bananas foster, creamed corn, and almond.

On the palate rich, decadent flavors of creme brulee, praline, marzipan, and sweet corn. Pretty evenly split between initial taste and mid-palate; glides between flavor notes smoothly. 

Finish has some prickly heat, barrel char, and a kiss of oak and is of a solid high-medium length. The finish is not really cinnamon or pepper as much as it is more of an young spirit bite which shouldn't work but somehow it is a feature not a bug as it provides the right balance and keeps this very sweet bourbon from rolling over into ""dessert bourbon"" territory. 

Mouthfeel is chewy and viscous.

This one struck the right chord with me; sweet without being cloying with a delicious depth of flavor. At $53 and 100 proof, very much a rebuy for me. Really enjoying Wilderness Trail distillery so far and it really seems like they are on the right track."

4.25,Pleasing nose. Caramel with light vanilla and a hint of spice. Just the right amount of burn lingers. One of my new favorites.

3.75,"I’ve heard good things about this one, which is their bourbon with rye (they have a wheated bourbon as well). Let’s get right to it.
This is batch 15F02

The nose has a light perfumey/floral thing going on, in a good way. Not in a grandma perfumey way. There’s vanilla, light strawberries, light corn, maple syrup and yeast rolls.  

The palate is sweet and fairly oily with a slightly dusty/grainy feeling on the tongue. There is sweet corn, vanilla, honey, a little bit of butterscotch, and a hint of rye and a slight bitterness on the tip of the tongue.

The finish is medium in length with a slight bite of heat at the very beginning of the finish, but dissipates quickly. At first you get a big bump of rye spice and then it goes to a lingering sweet vanilla on the back of the palate/top of the throat and honey on the mid palate.

This is a very enjoyable bourbon. This one really benefits to resting in the glass for 10+ mins. It kept getting better as I came back to it. Though it’s youth is somewhat obvious, it’s not harsh or off putting at all. This is a  sweet gentle bourbon that touches on the lighter side of the spectrum of flavors and then finishes with a slight rye punch."
3.25,"Thin, young, rye comes through nicely, this is good but I prefer the SiB a lot more"
3.75,"Brown sugar, mild sweetness, with some rye spice. Good not great. Tastes maybe a bit young"

4.5,"Mythical Wilderness Troll pick.  4 year 4 month.  Cinnamon and extra burnt caramel.  Baking spices.  Caramelized Peaches and apricots.  Vanilla frosting. Dusty corn.  Raisins.  Just a hell of a lot going on.  Slight hint of green youngness and the alcohol has a bite on the nose.

Very oily and viscous.  Very sweet overall.  Burned, almost rock candy like caramel.  The fruit is a darker cherry than what I was getting on the nose.  That vanilla frosting note is still quite strong too.  The lighter caramelized apricots come back on legs and finish.

Hands down the best Wilderness Trail pick I have had.  The youngness only shows itself in the alcohol and slight bite.  Otherwise it is all just these deep delicious dessert flavors.  The sweetness on this one is so over the top.  It’s straight candy awesomeness."

4.5,Nice caramel taste on the initial sip. Definitely notes of vanilla on the tongue. Nice 100 proof tingle on the swallow. Would absolutely buy again as a daily sipper.
