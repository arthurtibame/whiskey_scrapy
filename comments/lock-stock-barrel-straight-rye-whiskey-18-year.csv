5.0,"Good nose. Gingerbread. Butter. Brown sugar. Velvety on the tongue. Super smooth, it does not drink like a 109 proofer. Nose translates to the tongue. Super long finish. Good stuff. 12/22/17
Over two years later and... still great. What a nose, with cacao nibs, fruit, salted butter, lambic, burnt sugar, and perfume. On the tongue, spicer than I remember it, but still elegant. Some dark cacao, slightly sour fruit, nice warmth. 4/8/2020"

4.5,"I don't even want to drink this. All I want to do is smell it! The nose is so round, no rough edges at all. Toasted caramel citrus. As I smell, my drinking partner sips and what comes out of his mouth is hilarious...""woof, woof, I'm glad I was ready for that!"". ""A round rustic pile of rye."" This is an absolute beast. Makes the Taylor Four Grain loom like child's play. 109 proof. oooh yeah! More later...."

4.5,"Wow this is amazing! Dark, rich, nutty and smooth for a rye. 95"
4.0,"Smells like awesome rum. Tastes like a rye that is a smidge too sweet, and not enough spice. Don’t get me wrong, this rye is delicious. However, every rye between $40-90 that is rated highly is better than this. I have no regrets buying this bottle, because it was a unique experience, but I won’t miss it, and I’m glad it’s no longer taking up space on my shelf."

5.0,I’ve been slightly obsessed with this Rye ever since I first tried it. The 16yr is also fantastic.
4.5,"What a great rye. A hint of spiciness when neat.  Rounded taste, a slight syrup mouth feel, a touch of sweetness under there.  A great purchase."
5.0,"Taste this neat and your first words will be wow. this shit is a crazy dynamic, hot and spicy and sexy. Unique for sure but well worth a try. The nose is deceivingly simple and subtle, spicy but not insane. That first taste though. With a splash (1/2 a straw full) it really changes though. The spice moved to the back of my cheeks and the taste was warm, sweet and something earthy but confusing. I don't know that I've had a rye like this before."
4.5,"Well this is special. Smooth and delicious, nice and a little spice. A beautiful finish and just so smooth. Perfect for a special occasion - I had some at my brother’s house on a Monday night while watching “The Mummy” sequel."

3.5,"The nose is full of rye with equal amounts of floral notes, along with ginger, baking spices, with oak and vanilla balancing it all out. The palate is hot and peppery with strong cinnamon and rye, with charred oak and a touch of vanilla. The finish is long and the hotness carries over with cinnamon filling the mouth on top of charred oak. This whiskey seems all over the place and slightly confused, which is disappointing for a whiskey of this stature."
4.5,Delicious. Smooth. Complex. Fun to drink

3.5,"Much better than whistle pig 10, not a rye fan, one of the best ryes.  Beginning not so great, great finish though."
5.0,"One delicious and fiery rye with notes of caramel, pepper, cinnamon, cloves, chocolate, apples, cherries. and peaches"

4.25,"Still super unique. Overpriced, sure, but something I enjoy drinking when I want a change up. Old, 100% rye is not something you see every day."
