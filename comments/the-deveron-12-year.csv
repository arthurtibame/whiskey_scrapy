4.0,Very drinkable with quite a bit more character than expected. Fruity nose gives way to a subtle richness that belies the price. An excellent dram for a warm spring evening.

4.0,"Very nice everyday sipper, especially for the price. Evenly balanced whisky, nothing overpowers. The nose is green apples, honey and a hint of coconut. On the palate there is toffee apples, some honey, with a bit of oak. The finish was disappointingly short but not bad,  definite white pepper taste."
null,"Blue, delicate nose"
5.0,"First up there isn't any peat in this finely balanced dram. It is a wonderful easy sipping whiskey to enjoy with friends, and decent value at au$75 plus the bottle is fantastic. Well balanced and nothing is harsh or out of place."

4.0,"This is not a big malt in the way that, say, Ardbeg or Macallan are. There's a delicacy here, a certain understated, peaceful, even quiet elegance. The Deveron does not shout to get your attention with enormous amounts of smoke or sherry. Instead, it's a calm, gentle invitation to savor the sweet, slightly floral aromas of vanilla, caramel, ripe apple, cinnamon, clove, and oatmeal, with just a hint of a distant fire and a pinch of white pepper. Palate-wise, you could call this a breakfast dram, but that would be damning it with faint praise - while it's gentle and light, it's also a creamy, delicately flavorful sip full of apple, vanilla, and oaty notes, with that playful hint of smoke drifting around in the background. It's a lovely fall whisky, and at less than $50, it's a decent value, to boot."

4.0,"Good, easy drinking highland single malt."
3.25,"I have been off the grid for a bit. Vacation and family obligations have been a distraction; some pleasant and some woeful.  This particular Saturday finds me hanging back sitting on a couch with the wife by my side.  I brought this Deveron to our beach house vacation and just had some cursory tastings.  Now, I figured, is the time to go in depth. 

A Highlander bottled at a modest 40%.  “When billows break and haar ghosts in, then haste ye home or some bit warm, unwind with toasted grain and apples, seaborne spice; calm from the storm” quoth the bottle. 

A straw colored pour which reveals bright floral, fruity and sweet nose of dampened hay after a September rain.  A subdued sweetness slowly and increasingly works its way in with vanilla custard, honeyed oatmeal.  Add a mixture of apples and pears with a sprinkle of cinnamon and pecans.

A smooth and velvety arrival within a medium light body.  The sweetness is the show but it doesn’t dominate the spotlight.  Caramel with confectioners sugar and honey.  All that sweetness is tempered with a zing of fresh ginger or white pepper and cinnamon spiciness.  Again, the orchard fruits are always present.  As it starts to fade into the finish, a maritime brininess and a tinge of barrel char emerges. 

The palate is left with wood spices and tannins.  The char sticks to the tongue, briefly.  A bit small amount of bitterness comes through but quickly dissipates.  The finish is sparse and what remains is a woody dryness. 

A solid offering that is inoffensive with a nice bouquet and a simple and sweet palate with a subtle spiciness. A summer sipper or a breakfast in a bottle. Enjoyable simplicity...with a nice beach glassed bottle.  [$55][85/100][Tasted: 8/17/19]"

3.5,"★★★½
J'avais besoin de couper la soirée en deux!
Après la septième merveille du monde, je me devais de remettre les pieds sur terre et je me suis dit qu'un whisky d'entrée de gamme serait parfait pour remettre les pendules à l'heure. Je n'ai rien de plus à dire sur ce whisky, mis à part que c'est quand même bien pour le prix."
4.0,I'm brand new to neat whisky and am having a hard time differentiating the flavors and notes but so far this is one of my favorites. It is smooth and easy to drink.

3.0,Very yummy. It wasn’t in your face bold. Dig the sweetness (caramel) and the wood.
4.0,"Nose: Sherry, dried fruits (figs, dates), soft ground spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, caraway, powdered ginger), brown sugar, light bouquet garni, fresh cut daisies!, apples and pears.

Palate: Soft creamy and fruit-malt arrival. The development is equally soft and brings out honey and some oak. Vanilla, butterscotch and apple danish (but made with sour green apples). There's a slight salty tinge that is very well balanced with a herbal element and even a tiny whiff of smoke way in the background.

Finish: Medium/short. Fruity, trailing out into a pleasantly mild dry and tannic finale like cold black tea, but balanced by faint wisps of honey and oak.

Overall, this is a very well balanced and appealing whisky. It's not a hefty bruiser but it has character and is not lightweight.  There's a slight maritime quality to it that is very agreeable. You certainly don't mistake it for a blend, but it is very easy drinking and approachable.

Highly recommended and excellent value for money, this is a great example of an affordable daily dram single malt. It is surprisingly overlooked in general but 4 stars here. Now pardon me while I pour another dram.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"
4.0,"Such an excellent sipping scotch. Smooth, creamy, juicy, sweet and crisp! Just over a 4.0 for me.
