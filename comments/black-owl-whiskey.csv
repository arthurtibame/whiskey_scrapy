3.25,"I can bet 1000 dollars you haven't heard about this one. This ""Whiskey"" made of bourbon (¿?) Is an Ecuadorian manufactured Whiskey, made using Bulk blended Bourbon, water and adding caramel, this cheap bottle is fine (regular). On the nose is beautifully sweet, with vanilla, honey, orange, toffee, caramel, cough remedy, Christmas Cake and a little alcohol. On the palate is a little harsh (like all cheap whiskies), with oak, brown dry grasses, slight spices, a little bitter, and hotness overall. It is light-medium bodied, finish is medium and very harsh with some oakyness. Drank it at the airport, it was 40% abv. Nothing to remember, but not bad either."
