4.0,Bold flavor upfront with an immediate bite.  The bourbon then smooths out to a delicious finish!  Well done!
3.75,"Seems woody and smoky, but I'm not sure those are really the right descriptors.  Smooth and easy to drink, overall very pleasant."
3.75,"Overly sweet, like simple syrup."

3.75,"Color: honey, light copper, great legs

Nose: vanilla, butterscotch, hint of oak; very inviting 

Palate: light, minty, lots of vanilla, caramel, balanced oak undertone; as advertised by the nose

Finish: modest heat; tapers off fairly quickly, but lingers with wintergreen

Good, but would be better with more body and around 100 proof. It feels a bit watered down. The mint/wintergreen aftertaste is really nice."
3.75,"Nice and smooth, light minty oak and vanilla on the palate. Slight burn on the finish with the mint lingering."

4.5,"Barrel 995 - simply delicious.  Vanilla on the nose with a bit of ethanol.  It starts with nuttiness and caramel, maybe a hint of chocolate.  Apples pick up before the alcohol hits.  A bit of cinnamon and clove with the burn."
5.0,Carmel.

3.75,"I’d expect a single barrel to be at least 90 proof, but for ~$30, this definitely brings enough complexity to really enjoy.  It’s an easy sipper that is smooth and enjoyable for any occasion.  Mint is a common theme, with a nice balance of sweetness.  Medium finish.  Overall a solid pour!  7.9/10"

4.5,Great! Oak with a bit of heat. Much depth and complexity. If I could find this barrel (1265) again I would buy a case immediately! Can’t find anything better for the price!
3.75,"Nose: Red Apple, Pepper, Oak, Young grain, Sour rye

Taste: Pepper, Cinnamon, Oak, heat, Buttery finish, Somewhat mellow rye, Quite mellow so the bottle is probably pretty oxidized"
3.0,"Just a hint of medicine on the nose. Certainly not offensive. In the mouth and in the finish it is a very good bourbon. I almost rated it higher but nothing really distinguishes it from a stereotypical bourbon. Typical flavors of vanilla, spice and some nuttiness, but all underwhelming."
3.5,I’m no pro.  I prefer a little less burn and slightly sweeter.  It does go down easily and is tasty for the price. Made an excellent Old Fashioned.

3.5,Really great corn sweet and with a vanilla chocolate oak finish. For the price this is a better than average daily drinker.

3.75,"Bottle poured neat into Glencairn at home. Barreled on 7-23-10, barrel 49, bottled on 11-27-17. Nose has the caramel and butterscotch I loved from the 2011, though not as prominent; lots of oak comes on, along with some heat. Taste is oaky and spicy, with some citrus notes. Nice long aftertaste, drinks a tad hotter than the proof.  Decent, though I prefer the 2011.  6/9/19"

3.75,"2010: 
Nose: having trouble getting much. Very smooth. My bottle be too oxidized. Some grains and young oak.

Taste: lots of yummy bright spices rolling around with green apples and oakyness. Lasting spice tingling finish."

4.0,"Smooth. First smell was vanilla. Nice with or without ice. Nice finish. Not a veteran, but it’ definitely pours a nice glass."
