4.0,"Solid Irish whiskey that doesn't demand much of the drinker. It has a sweetness and softness to it without compromising its decent flavor spectrum. This is a good whiskey to keep on hand for day to day, or to use as an introduction for those uninitiated to the world of whiskey."
3.0,A pub whiskey that goes well with live Irish bands.

2.0,"Cheap Irish whiskey. It’ll get the job done, but nothing to write home about. That said, it does taste slightly above its price point, so in that sense, for some it might offer a little more bang for the buck. In this price range, others will want to spend just a few bucks more and go Jameson or Bushmills (depending on one’s loyalties)."

Smoother than I would have expected. Mixes well also if you are looking for something to make cocktails. Nothing fancy and not a super deep or complex flavor, but not bad either."

3.0,"This is the ultimate cheap-n-cheerful Irish whiskey. Is it fancy? Hell no. Is it complex? Nope. Will you spend hours pondering its mysteries as you sit in your study, fire crackling, surrounded by leather bound books and old maps? Not on your life. Is this, however, a fantastically easy drinking whiskey that will be a hit at parties when you want something pleasant, but not distracting? Paddy'll get that job done for you. The very floral nose and the sugar cookie-like palate (with hardly any burn) are perfectly designed for the craic, so to speak. I can't really give this more than three stars, but it's great for what it is - a cheap, fun, relaxed whiskey for those moments when the drink in the glass is meant to be part of the ensemble cast rather than in a starring role."

2.0,"At this price range I feel you are in better hands with a buzz provided from Tullamore D.E.W. or Bushmills.  After many weeks of talking about a recommendation from another customer, Paddy seemed pretty disappointing when I finally had it.  While I prefer Tully and Bushmills over Jameson, I would say i prefer all three over Paddy.  Maybe this one guy liked this whiskey for some other reason, but I can't with good conscience recommend this at the liquor store I work at for anything other than a mixer.  It's not in my taste preferences.  I would rather drink a $20 rum, cognac, scotch, Irish whiskey, pretty much any other $20 liquor than this one.  And that's at a Jason's price point.  Boring, barely noseless till you get halfway down the bottle, and still, nothing special.  Literally nothing exciting to report on the tip of the tongue.  It's not terrible, it's just why spend money to sip on something like this?  If you are buying it, don't buy it to sip on.  And only buy it if you don't care about the money you spent on it."

5.0,"I recommend this bottle to everyone I meet. It is a very smooth drinker with buttery soft texture, subtle notes of grain and a bit of almond. I absolutely always have a bottle of this in my cabinet. It’s a bottle that no one is offended by. It is a phenomenal chassis for a mixed drink or to mellow a stronger scotch even. A splash of an Islay and it’s a whole new dram. I’ve been adding a few drops of the Woodford Reserve spiced cherry bitters and loving every minute of it. At this price you can’t go wrong!"

2.0,"About what you'd expect at this price point. The nose and palate are similar to that of its fellow entry level Irish whiskies. In this case, it's a little less complex and a bit of a harsh burn akin to rubbing alcohol. The finish is brief, not much to say here. Overall, it isn't bad. About a 2.5. It's not as good as entry level Jameson, Bushmills, or Tullamore Dew, but it is cheaper. It's worth picking up a bottle if you're on a budget or are just looking for something to throw in a flask."

2.0,"Appearance: The color for this Irish Whiskey was a light gold, while the legs were thick and strangely both viscous and watery.

Nose: The nose journey began bready with yeast notes. After that notes like orange and other citrus fruits, cinnamon, ginger, cherry and a very small bubblegum note all followed in the procession.

Taste: The palate began with the familiar “sparkly” grain whiskey taste, and a shortbread cookie note, followed by cherry candy and lemon zest. It was a simple palate, but unoffensive.

Finish: The finish started with a sting of heat at first and then mellowed out into an average finish.

Thoughts: This Irish Whiskey was nice, pleasant, inoffensive, but boring. As a mixer or for one who is transitioning from clear to brown spirits, specifically whisk(e)y, I could recommend it. For anything else though, It’s cheap but I’d just save my money a little longer. Thanks Paddy! Sláinte!"

3.0,"Got a bottle of Paddy for 17.99 on sale at a local shop.  Decent enough Irish, it's very smooth with a buttery, fruity nose.  Taste's just the same, I got butterscotch, vanilla, more dark fruity flavors.  Finish is quick, no real burn to speak of.  I'd say it's just a step below Jameson but for what is it, it's not bad at all.  Served neat, as usual ice kills Irish so i wouldn't recommend having it any other way besides neat."

3.0,"Irish whiskey is Irish whiskey am I right? no, ok maybe but the general take is from Redbreast to Bushmills you can find an Irish whiskey that is approachable, easy to enjoy and maybe even a tasty treat.   I'm no Irish whiskey expert but I certainly enjoy the Irish whiskey experience from a ""highlanders pov"" so ""my Island"" and such to the experts and blarney stones and haggis for all .  As I was about to pick up that pint of Jamey I thought you know what lets give this Paddy's a whirl.  Here's to the joy of trying something new.  Not only is Paddys NOT rot gut, cheap swill, it actually flys the green white and orange proudly.  I'm almost amazed how absolutely smooth it is and while maybe not as lusty as a pricey bottle of ole Irish it still comes through with the quality of a nice malt and toast spirit with a sweet warm character and only the mildest of a burning tinge.  

At only a half to 2/3s of the price of the familiar green or square bottles, Paddy's stands up for itself in a bit of a proud Irish,  ""toe the line"",  tradition,  maybe not a fantastic bottle,  but nothing to be ashamed of either, it's a great value Irish whiskey, worthy of the genre.   For a cheap bottle of ""mud in yer eye"" you could do far far worse.  Cheers!"

3.75,"This Irish is a blend of all three: malt, single pot, and grain whiskies. A higher proportion of malt gives it a better mouth feel than the typical Irish blend. It noses of nutty cereal grain, malt, and honey---with a bit of spice thrown in. The flavors are true to this. The finish is rather short. This is a fine middle-of-the-road Irish. Being aged up to 7 years makes it a little smoother than Bushmills or Jameson. Distiller rates this at 78, and Whiskeyreviewer gives it a C+. I think that is about right.
