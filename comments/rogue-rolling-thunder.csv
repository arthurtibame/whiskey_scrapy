3.75,"Smells of Belgian waffles, pungent aged dark cherries and maple with a bit of an unusual mustiness; burned chocolate and a clear malt flavor give this a bold and unique profile over a traditional peppery rye flavor. A delightfully different change of pace that is likely not for whisk(e)y beginners."

2.0,"The Rogue Stouted is boldly Oregonian. It’s deeply FUNKY and dank. On the nose and pallet, you definitely get a double dose of the stout, but it’s got another level that’s pure Oregon musty funk with some cheese-like footiness. As a tasting, it’s definitely unique and interesting, but I probably wouldn’t sit and drink several glasses."
