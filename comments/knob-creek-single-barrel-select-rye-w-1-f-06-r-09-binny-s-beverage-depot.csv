4.25,"This is a 6 year old barrel pick from Shores Liquor in Daytona Beach, FL. Bottled in 2018 at 6 years and 1 month. 115 proof.

Nose of vanilla, rye bread, dried apricot. Rich and raw mouthfeel. The 115 proof definitely shows on first taste. Sweet apricot that is quickly overwhelmed by an intense rye spice, that fades to a very long lasting warm sweet, blueberry/cranberry finish wrapped in barrel notes. After adding water, this tones down to a delicious, well rounded, man's rye pour. Very impressed. Well done Shores Liquors. Amazing value at $46 for a barrel proof 6 year-old rye."
