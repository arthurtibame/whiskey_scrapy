4.0,"Has a little of the brininess characteristic of the Islay malts, but with a sweet finish and a beautiful, striking Rose color."

4.0,Not as fruity as other people say. Not smokey. Just smooth. Comes in a cool bottle too.

3.0,Found a bottle at the Pendergast in Kansas City. Too salty for me such that it masks some of the elegance that likely exists. Lightly smoky/peaty and a bit oily.

4.0,"Sweet honey and toffee, hints of banana and brine.  Honey sweetness  encased in a creamy palate  The brininess is pronounced with the addition of water. Tongue burn slowly works its way all over.  A spicy, bitter medium length finish of oak and slight drying tannins. [86/100] [Tasted 11/10/14 @ Tellers Chophouse]"

4.0,12/17 really nice. Mild nose. Smooth fruity/vanilla palate. Slight smoke on finish

5.0,For price to quality ratio - it is perfect. Regrettably did not score more bottles when it was widely available. The perfect 'Islay-lite' for me.

3.75,"Sweet, vanilla, faint raspberry, some spicyness and white pepper on the back of the tongue. Tastes quite young. Not a smooth dram, but interesting."
3.0,"Less peated but still influenced by the sea salt from Islay.  Very smooth and easy to drink. Still a long way from Sherry cask whiskeys. 

My favorite Islay Scotch."

3.25,"Young and spiky ginger, apple, Barley forward and black pepper. Much better with ice. Becomes sweeter and less spiky."
