3.0,"Think sitting beside the fireplace on a cold night. Not for the faint of heart with regards to peatiness as it made my eyes water with too big of a sip. I bought a bottle because of its reputation and its darn good but not worth it's price. Don't get me wrong, it's solid, smoky, warming, full of spice and cinnamon and oaky to its core."

4.0,Cloudy gold. Something you would expect to find in a sunken pirate ship. Wet bacon and apple salad with a drizzle of petrol. Hint of pungent cocoa. Long smoky finish. This is the real deal.

5.0,"The nose reeks of that muggy forest rotten wood. Not as briny, got some meatiness to it.
Easy drinking.
Charred meat."
