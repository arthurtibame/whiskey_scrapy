4.25,"Wonderful aroma, full of grape smell!"
4.5,"Another very good Benriach effort. Blood oranges, caramel, sultanas, dessert wine. not in the same league as the 18 yr Albarize but still very nice. a few drops of water opened it up nicely. started at 4.25 but by the end it was up in the 4.5 territory."
4.25,"strong, but delicate and flavours"
