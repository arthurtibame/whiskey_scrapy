2.5,Very light nose smell. Rather spicy with some burn. Oak and rye flavor. Pretty average overall. Enjoyed first glass neat and next glass over 2 Ice cubes that helps with the burn. Nothing special but an ok sipper for a cheap rye.
2.0,I do not like the nose on this. The taste is much sweeter than I expected. It’s not bad but not great either. I will try other ryes so I have something to compare to.
3.0,"A pleasant light vanilla smell. A little watery start. Strong rye taste, high alcohol burn. Nice lingering spicy finish."
4.0,"Spicy bite up front with a sweetish finish (neat).

A few drops of water tames the spice."

5.0,"For a young rye whiskey, this is very delicious. Hints of spice and oak with a nice rye after taste. Very smooth but a bite after taste of cinnamon. Good deal in it's class."
