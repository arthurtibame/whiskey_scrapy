4.5,"Top five drams for me at WhiskyFest SF. I loved The Dark, but The Light is more of an outlier as far as the standard HP flavor profile is concerned, and I MUST find a bottle tomorrow."

4.25,"Light (appropriately) with an almost ‘prickly’ finish on the tongue, but fairly mild nose, and relatively short finish.  Slightly higher ABV than most Highland Park expressions, but doesn’t really challenge the drinker in this dram.  American Oak casks, so the vanilla notes are front and centre.  Lovely."
null,"One of 12 1/2 or 1/4 oz pours drammers club. Nice tropical feel with notes of vanilla, caramel, kiwi, citrus, floral, apricot, and chocolate."
4.0,"Nose - (w/o water) Light smoke, fresh pears, hay, light floral honey, hint of salt (w/ water) Smoke is almost gone, pears, hay/grass, honey

Taste - (w/o water) Light smoke, pears, hint of caramel, light honey, light salt, lightly drying, white pepper spice/heat (w/ water) Light smoke re-appears, more black pepper than white pepper tingle, light oaky bitterness comes out in addition to the same flavors w/o water

Finish - (w/o water) Light tingle/heat, lingering light smoke, golden simple sugar, hints of pear, honey, lemon zest (w/ water) Light tingle/heat still, hint of oaky bitterness, pear, honey, salt, lemon zest

Score - 82/100

Final Thoughts - This surprisingly drank well below its proof. The nose wasn't too punchy for the proof. Nice balance of smoke, fruit, & sweet. Addition of water softened the nose a bit, but brought out some oaky bitterness that wasn't bad, but a tad distracting. I think this one is tasty and I could see myself reaching for this every once in a while, but not at what it's priced at.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

4.5,Wonderful. Sweet smell with hints of violet and vanilla. Starts oaky and smoky with a bitter fruitiness with end of smoky richness.

4.5,Erittäin pehmeä! Ei tässä jää paljoa toivomisen varaa..
4.25,"Bright, with tropical and citrus fruits. A little harsh neat, add water and you get that beautiful balance of Highland Park heathery peat with fruity flavors. 93"

4.5,"Almost everything that Highland Park does  is great. The most northern of Scotland's distilleries are also known for their amazing marketing, and ""collections"", from the vikings to the smugglers (who were also vikings), this is one of my favorite distilleries. 

This time i am reviewing Highland Park 17yo The Light, one of a two bottle collection, (the other one is ""the Dark"") which are inspired in the seasons on Orkney. This one of course represents spring and summer. 

Bottled at 52.9%abv we can expect lots of flavors.

On the nose, it is citric and slightly peaty. Artificial tangerine notes, Artificial orange also. A dim Highland Park traditional peat.
Burnt grass. Nice aroma; Lemon and after breathing a slight chocolate note comes up.

On the palate it gets very mineral and salty. Coastal, Earthy. Mostly mineral and coastal to reveal a chocolate explosión on the finish.  After first two sips vanilla is felt, since your mouth get used to the peatiness and the minerals.

Finish is lovely. Chocolate with peat and ashy spiceness. Incredible aftertaste. Burns your lips nicely as any other hp.

Overall this is a beautiful dram. A little expensive, but it is a lovely bottle with some nice juice on it. My score for it is 94 over 100."
