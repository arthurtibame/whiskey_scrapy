4.0,"Smells like apple cider, maybe some floral honey. Uncomplicated, but pleasant and actually a nice nose for this price point. Very sharp on the tongue initially, but vanilla, wood, and apple quickly follow and it's smooth on the backend. Not as bitter or harsh as I would expect for this price point. Not that much warmth going down, but there's an interesting aftertaste... can't quite describe it, a bit of nutty char? If it's true that this is being discontinued, that's a shame. Definitely punches above its weight. 4/1/17
  Fruit, toffee, char. Minor spice that lingers, with some dark chocolate. Pleasant sipper. 7/1/17"

3.0,"Really good for the cheap price point. I've certainly paid more for worse. It seems to have a bit of a minty taste that numbs my lips. It's got just a bit of a bite that might be good as a mixer. 

It's not bad, but not my favorite."

2.0,"Bought as a bottle shelf bargain $16 for a liter. Nothing special here, would use it for a mixer or serve on ice to a non bourbon drinker if they asked to try it by name. Aged at least 36 months it says on the neck of the bottle.  Tried at room temp. In a rock glass. Smoother than expected but I noticed a strange after taste that wasnt expected about half way through  the glass. Not bad just a little strong/different.  But for the price you can only expect so much right."

2.5,"This may be the cheapest whiskey I’ve bought since starting this journey a little over three years ago. I bought this for sharing/mixing for our annual October family bonfire, and for this purpose it did not disappoint. Contrary to the write-up here on Distiller, this is not discontinued. 

AAA 10 Star is produced by Buffalo Trace using their #2 mashbill of 80-83% corn, 12-15% rye, and 5% barley. It’s the same mashbill used for Blantons, Elmer T Lee, Rock Hill Farms, and Hancocks Reserve. It’s bottled at 45% ABV and set me back a whole $15 for a liter. There is some indication that this once carried a three year age statement, but there is nothing like that on this bottle. It is labeled “straight” bourbon, so it is at least two years old, but I’d say not much more than that. 

In the glass it’s a medium gold. Swirling produces some quick thin legs. Neat it’s not much to talk about, but what did you expect? The nose is sweet corn with an odd hint of citrus, maybe orange peel? And not much else. The palate is more sweet corn with little of the typical bourbon flavors of caramel and vanilla. Actually kind of bland. The finish, what there is of it, is short with alcohol heat and a bit of oak char. 

For $15/liter I can’t complain. It’s a perfectly acceptable mixer and even made a tolerable Old Fashioned. 2.5/5. Cheers!"
4.0,Carmel and sugar. Really really good for price. Would never turn this down.
3.75,Upped by half a star bc of the price. Sipped slow over a large sphere of ice.  Heat backed off and sweetness came out a bit as it sat. Better than avg mixer and solid back up/cheap date sipper. 1.75 for $26!

3.0,"The $28.99 price is for a 1.75 L from VA ABC. Another Buffalo Trace bottom shelf offering from Mashbill #2. Aged longer and bottled at 90 Proof, this is a better sipping bourbon than standard Ancient Age. And contrary to what has been reported here, 
Buffalo Trace confirmed that it has not been discontinued. They dropped the age 
statement all together and became it Ancient Ancient Age 10 Star with a new statement that says “Aged at least 36 months”. Not bad for the price, but fairly prosaic."

4.5,"Smooth, just very smooth. Nose is just decent with sweet notes. Taste is very smooth with little to no bite until the very very end. Pleasantly surprised this one could go toe to toe with the likes of blantons."
3.75,"I know that this is the same mashbill as Blanton’s, Elmer T. Lee  etc. and is a bottom shelf version of this mashbill (Buffalo Trace mashbill #2), but this is the older version of the regular Ancient Age.

The nose has sweet corn, rye spice, other baking spices, cooked apples and a light leather note.

The palate has a creamy and oily texture that is sweet with baking spices, dark fruit, corn  a little bit of leather and vanilla.

The finish is long with lingering vanilla and light fruit notes on the mid palate.

This is really good, and amazing for the price. I compared it to Blanton’s, which is only 3 proof higher. Blanton’s has a richer nose and palate, but the mouthfeel on the AAA 10 Star is much thicker.  The AAA basically hits on the same notes as Blanton’s, but much more dialed back."

2.25,"Very light flavors,  weak finish.  All the normal vanilla caramel flavors are there just not enough going on."
4.25,This was a delicious bottle of bourbon from the 1990s. Warm caramel sweetness.
3.0,Lots of spice. Lots of sweetness in the aroma.  Nice boozy burn

3.75,Exceptionally smooth and just spicy enough. Value is incredible for I being a liter. Definitely recommend this bottle.
3.0,"Good ‘ole AAA 10 Star.  I’ve had this bottle for about 4 years, and I’ve been through a few bottles of these in past as well.  This bottle has a laser code from late 2014.  This has no age age statement (so to speak), but print on the neck says it’s at least 36 months old.  Although I’ve heard and read things that puts this older, I have no idea - but it comes off to me as being fairly young. The last time I was at Buffalo Trace, I tried to get more info on the age but I was unsuccessful.

N: Corn, maple, vanilla, oak, brown sugar, light banana and apple.

P:  Corn, maple syrup, brown sugar, light allspice, vanilla.

F:  Thin, allspice, oak, light pepper and mint.

I typically like corn forward bourbon (Wathens, Old Tub, Garrison brothers, etc..).  This is corn forward as well, but it’s not as dominant as the bourbon’s mentioned above.  I don’t see this one much anymore.  I would usually buy it when I saw it.  It’s fairly cheap; I think around $16 a bottle?  It’s been awhile so I’m not sure what it goes for now.  Maybe more expensive now like everything else.  After drinking much better bourbon over the years, I don’t really miss not finding this so much, but I still retain a soft spot for it.  Bottom line - it’s nothing to seek out really.  Although, It’s decent for the price."

3.75,"I was very close to rating this 4/5 stars simply because when it was for sale at under $15 a fifth, it was a great value. It’s a younger and less complex Buffalo Trace mashbill #2 (think Blanton’s or Elmer T. Lee). But still quite good. 

Nose: honey and bright fruits

Palate: butterscotch, spicy vanilla, and
floral 

Finish: rye builds more at the end. 

Standard Ancient Age which is about 3-years-old is nowhere close to this. A shame it’s discontinued."
3.75,"Baby Elmer, Baby Blanton’s, whatever you want to call this, it’s a shame it isn’t being produced anymore. Especially the 10-year version. 

Nose: candy corn, oak, toffee

Palate: bright and spicy, with hints of vanilla 

Finish: rye comes in more here as well with butterscotch and a pleasant warmth"

3.25,"Nose - Toasted sugar, milk chocolate, caramel, very faint sweet mint, untoasted sesame, cherry cough syrup

Taste - Sweet vanilla, hint of toasted coconut, faint sweet mint, lightly dry & tannic, light orange zest.

Finish - Lasting sweet cinnamon heat/tingle, sweet toasted vanilla, splenda-like coconut, light toasted bitter orange pith.

Score - 78/100

Final Thoughts - So this was a strange one trying blind. On initial nose before it had a tiny bit of time to air out, it had a more prominent sweet mint note which led me to believe it was some sort of rye, but then this quickly faded and the more classic vanilla caramel notes took over. This led me to believe this was a high-rye bourbon. Initially pretty pleasant on the palate with an interesting toasted coconut flavor but sadly this transitioned into this sort of off-putting splendaish sweet with a hint of bitter citrus pith. Not too bad on the nose & initial palate, but the finish kind of kills it.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - Probably not"

4.0,"Being a big BT fan, I decided to track down a bottle of AAA 10 Star and give it a try. I wasn’t disappointed. 

I can see why some refer to this as “Baby Blanton’s,” since it’s made with the same mashbill and exhibits many of the same characteristics. Thankfully, it’s a lot more affordable and a lot easier to obtain. 

Some nice rye spice and a warm Kentucky hug. Surprisingly complex for the price. Great in an old fashioned, but good enough to drink neat. 

My only real complaint is the plastic bottle. I have no shame when it comes to imbibing “cheap” bourbon, but I don’t like to be reminded of it every time I pick up the bottle. 

I’ll be very upset if this suffers the same egregiously over-priced and understocked fate as its Buffalo Trace brethren, so it’ll have to be our little secret."
