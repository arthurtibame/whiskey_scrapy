4.5,"Serge at Whiskyfun called this Tobermory 'the Freddy Krueger of sherried whiskies', so let's dream of the Isle of Mull! Distilled in 1972 and bottled in 2006, the nose of this 33-year-old serial killer unfolds with old leather, roasted coffee beans and strong notes of balsamic vinegar. It's very concentrated, vinous and heavy, almost like thick blood. On the palate, the flavor bomb explodes with intense wood spices, plums and dark chocolate, leaving behind a dry and gingery finish with bitter bay leaves and hints of espresso. A ruthless sherry monster, without a doubt.
