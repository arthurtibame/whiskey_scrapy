4.25,"Definitely sweeter, but balanced"
4.0,"Cask# 288
Abv: 41.9%
Actually a kome honkaku shochu aged in oak, so the abv is likely near the actual cask strength

Nose:vanilla, oak, sweet
Palate: eggnog,sweet creamy vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove
Finish:eggnog continues for a bit, then lingering vanilla and oak dryness"
4.25,"First opening smelled like asitane. Tasted very light with lots of vanilla cream. Some fruit.

Opens up really nicely. Nose goes to caramel and fruit. Taste really nice barrel spice that is more like cedar or spruce. Dark fruits and leather. nice medium length finish."
4.5,Coming from the mindset historically of a bourbon or scotch drinker. This was a welcomed change with a long soft finish. Very smooth with a fruity quality.
