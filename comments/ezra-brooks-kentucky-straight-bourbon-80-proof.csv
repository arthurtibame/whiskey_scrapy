3.75,"Didn't plan on getting this when I went to the store but I am glad that I did.  Very smooth, creamy vanilla flavor, it has a strange resemblance to Jameson to my tastebuds.  I would definitely buy it again at 11.99 for 750ml it's a great value whiskey."
4.25,Very smooth. Paired well with salted Caramel
