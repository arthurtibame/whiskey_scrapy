4.0,"Incredible nose. Sweet, kind of ""dark sweet"". Similar in taste - hot and sweet, even very sweet. And then comes a fury of different tastes - corn, vanilla, honey, fruity syrup and caramel.
  Yeah - lot of sweet :) Bit too much for me, still - this is a great burboun."

5.0,"Nose - (w/o water) - very hot due to the proof, but light oak, vanilla, sweet cherries, milk caramel. Very hot and sweet. (w/ water) - very similar nose, but with the heat toned down quite a bit. In addition I get a sweet honey and something almost like a sweet chocolate covered pineapple piece.
Taste - (w/o water) - Hit with sweet cherries, vanilla, light oak, sweet milk caramels, slight bitterness like you'd get from overly toasted almond skins in an English toffee. (w/ water) - the water tones it down and I get an extra taste of delicious milk chocolate that has dried cherries in it, wonderful.
Finish - (w/o water) - You get a lingering cinnamon burn that transitions into a slightly bitter taste, like if you bit into a cherry pit or apple seed. There's still hints of sweet vanilla and faint dried cherries. (w/ water) - The water tones down the cinnamon burn as well as the bitterness and I get more of a sweeter vanilla, but the milk chocolate I got in the taste transitions into a darker chocolate with dried cherries.

5.0,"128.2 proof... From the nose it's not that apparent that this is a higher proof than the standard Single Barrel offering, and the smell is familiar (meaning, very good). Once you take a sip, however, you realize you're in another tax bracket. Walnuts and peanut brittle smack you immediately, along with cinnamon (the genetically modified kind on steroids). This sharply stings the back of your throat in the most pleasant way possible, and it's warm warm warm going down. An oaky bitterness lingers, along with some nocino notes. Adding a splash of limestone water muted it just slightly, and heightened the vanilla notes a bit. In my view, this isn't just a stronger version of the standard Blanton's, it seemingly tastes like a different animal altogether. This is a muscle car with the engine that sticks out of the hood, the one that gets obnoxiously driven through your neighborhood, rattling the windows of your house as you question its existence, but causes you to daydream what it would be like to be behind the wheel. If Buffalo Trace adds this to the BTAC lineup, I'd understand (even though it probably would be just as hard to find and probably more expensive). Good stuff, worth seeking out. 4/12/17"

5.0,"This is fantastic. It's everything you like about the traditional Blanton's amplified to the max. It's big, bold and complex with multiple layers.  It has a surprisingly smooth finish for a barrel proof. I cracked my first bottle with some friends at an annual get together. Everyone loved it. This is one of my favorites and should really be the sixth member of the Antique Collection. The only problem is that it's currently only offered overseas. You can get it online but shipping costs are brutal."

5.0,"This bourbon gets a 5, but a ""soft"" 5 (if that makes any sense), in my book.  Blanton's Straight from the Barrel is the forbidden fruit, or at least the far-away fruit, in the Blanton's lineup -- available only overseas and not in the United States.  This bourbon has a dark, almost cloudy, russet, clay-like color.  Dark, sticky fruits, and chewy raisins and craisins, stand out immediately on the nose.  Behind that, there's a clear and harmonious combination of vanilla and caramel.   As a younger whiskey, Blanton's has less oakiness than older bourbons like Elijah Craig Barrel Proof on the nose, although there is a scent reminiscent of pencil shavings some of the time.  Whole peppercorns round out the strong start.  This bourbon drinks well below its proof, but lacks the complexity of the finest barrel-strength releases from other distilleries, or from the older products from Buffalo Trace itself.  Unlike the nose, the palate is heavy on the dry side, with cedar and oak woodiness abounding from the first sip onward.  There's more honey than caramel in this barrel.  The vanilla from the nose carries over well to the palate, but those dark, sticky fruits or dried fruits are nowhere to be found (at least for me).  The smokiness of Blanton's, from the barrel char, is stronger than other barrel-proof bourbons.  The texture is oily, rich, and buttery.  Compared to the nose, I once again get a surprising amount of oak on the swallow, along with cloves and rye spice.  The combination of cinnamon and creaminess is reminiscent of eggnog.  The spice dominates the back-end, which doesn't exhibit the harmony of the first two phases.  At $100, this is one of the most expensive bottles of bourbon I've ever purchased.  However, it's not the best.  With Blanton's, the intangible factors add significantly to the enjoyment.  By that, I mean the beautiful bottle and the fact that this bourbon isn't even available in the U.S., which adds to its cool factor.  But, on taste alone, I'd happily grab a bottle of Elijah Craig Barrel Proof or Four Roses Private Selection for $70-80 (and grab a bottle of Wild Turkey 101 with the savings!)."

4.0,"It’s good. It’s one of the more drinkable barrel proofs out there. That said, you’re gonna come up to this little guy with expectations that Booker’s (for instance) just doesn’t have to deal with. Particularly: how does stand up to his big brother, Blanton’s standard—one of America’s most highly sought bourbons.

The nose is not as astringent as you’d expect. I get vanilla. The body does have the Blanton’s flavors you’d expect (more vanilla and a nut favor) but they’re overpowered by the heat in a way that big brother isn’t. This spiciness comes to me via black pepper. What’s interesting is that on the finish, the heat fades quickly, leaving behind a nutty favor, with a bit of lemon.

With an ice cube added, I can get the nut flavor on the nose and lemon on the body. Heat turns down quite a bit and finish gets even sweeter. I think I prefer this one on the rocks, and to date, Blanton’s Gold is the best of the Blanton’s gang."

5.0,This one is very good !!! Strong and smooth. Grab a sip of you have the chance!!!!
5.0,"130.6
Bottled 11-1-16

Nose- Stunning nose. Think regular Blanton’s, but on steroids. Lots of orange citrus, dried fruits, and caramel. It smells like a wether’s original candy. Alcohol is slightly noticeable, but at 130 proof very muted. 
Palate-This is one HOT bourbon. It is very thick and chewy, but I couldn’t quite pick out notes due to the heat. I added 4 drops of water and this opened up beautifully. Water brought out the sweetness. Honey, butterscotch, vanilla, and that wonderful black pepper. Oak and pepper on the back end of the palate. 
Finish-The heat comes back on the back end, but in an amazing way. The finish is dry, but very long. It allows you to think about your sip before diving back in for more. I get lots of the rye spice and dry fruit. 
Conclusion-I love barrel proof bourbons and admittedly I’m a huge fan of Blanton’s, but this takes my love affair to another level. This is my favorite pour that I’ve ever had. SFTB could easily be the sixth offering in the BTAC"
5.0,null
4.0,"Nose- Sweat tea and green apple
Body- Rich with brown sugar and creamy caramel. Fruit notes are there too with rich plum giving way to the dry citrus. 
Finish- Spicy but fairly short finish. In 
fact, I find the finish to be a bit shorter than the gold rendition. You definitely feel the high proof here.

I love the beginning of this dram. There is a rich mouthfeel that really coats your tongue with sweet and fruity notes. However, at this abv (127.3) the finish is a bit challenging. I look forward to experimenting with a bit of water or ice. Very good overall but the gold wins out for me for a neat pour. 

First enjoyed this in a blind taste test where I destroyed Milliardo and Freeeeeeeedom! Haha!"

5.0,"This bourbon was dumped on 11-4-16 from barrel No. 585. It was stored in Warehouse H on Rick No. 25. The registered Bottle No. is 67, and comes in at 131.8 proof.

Big bold, rich bourbon that’s packing some heat. Has a nice amount of oak along with vanilla, light honey, butterscotch, and plump juicy raisins. Did I mention that it packs a lot of heat? A must buy if you're able to find it!"
4.0,null
4.75,"Nose: citrus, oak, pepper, vanilla. Blanton’s through and through. The palate packs every bit of punch you’d expect from a barrel proof high-rye mash bill. Citrus, oak, and pepper continue, and are joined by a honeyed sweetness that can be found amongst the high proof heat. Strong pepper and oak finish that sticks around just long enough, with a pleasant warmth. The heat doesn’t wrap your tongue the way a Stagg does, but is enjoyable nonetheless. If barrel proof bourbon is your thing, this is highly approachable even without a few drops of water, but it does respond well to a small amount and I would still suggest adding this to bring out the fruity notes. A substantial improvement on Blanton’s single barrel and a top choice in its own right."

Amazing aroma of sweet caramel, oranges, and some oak.  Taste doesn’t pull any punches...thick viscous, oranges and brown sugar.  Some heat...with a lingering long orange citrus finish.  Till today, I think the best bourbon I’ve had was the Four Roses 2016 LESB, but this falls close second.  Thanks @Dreaming-of-Islay for the pour!"

This really lets you know it’s a barrel proof bourbon and tingles your tongue.

4.75,"Considered to be one of the world's best Bourbons. This bottle was “dumped” on the 13th February 2017 from barrel number 47. Proof = Cask.

Nose – Carmel - Powerful, marked by honey, wooded vanilla, spices, tobacco and fudge.
Taste – Oak & Vanilla - Full, rich and creamy marked by citrus, butter, spice, honey, and heavy oak. Ginger Ale or Cola are the best mixers.
Finish - Long, with peaches and citrus, leading to a soft buttery chocolate aftertaste.

Flavor: Poached apples, dark sugars, crème brulee, heavy cereal oatmeal notes, baking spices.  Even more apple cobbler.  VERY buttery and delicious.

Finish: Medium length, some rye spice, intense dried tart apples, calvados, and toasted nuts.

4.75,"Neat.  Color notably darker than basic Blanton’s.  Nose is Blanton’s turned way up as expected.  Caramel, lots of baking space, honey, powdered sugar, deep dark cherry.  Cherry pastry even.

Really thick texture.  All sugar up front.  Blast of chocolate (I was not expecting) on the first sip, chased by tons of vanilla and a hint of spice.  Legs are mostly vanilla on first sip.  Sugar upfront still in the second hit but got some delightful cherry too.  Chocolate, vanilla, pastry swirl on the taste still.

Okay, this is a really good Barrel.  The nose was just Blanton’s turned up but the taste is something totally different and special.

Went back to basic Blanton’s immediately after.  It’s thin and almost off putting in the head to head comparison.  

Phew, no regrets getting this SFTB!"

Finish- Long, drying finish with notes of toasted oak and honey

5.0,This is the first time I have given anything a 5.  I thought this might be a bunch of hype but wow!  High proof but not overwhelming and lots of flavor comes through!   A must have if you can find one
4.5,Very good.  Lots of cherry and oak.   Best blantons.
4.25,"N: strong alcohol presence straight away. Gives way to deep rich caramel mixed with overload of baking spices
P: first sip is just straight alcohol. Leads up to apples and baking spices. Very warming.
F: Very long finish. Spiced, baked apples."

5.0,"Good golly. This is fiery and complex and then vanishes with a smooth finish that begs for the next sip. We’ll done, produce a product that allows the end user the ability to define the tasting experience. Straight, rocks, dab of distilled water, choose your adventure. This is solid, everything you want from a bourbon but with an adorable snarl."

4.25,"After going through several bottles of regular Blanton’s, I have been envious of those able to get their hands on the Straight From The Barrel version, which is not sold within the U.S. But after tracking one down online, I’m finally able to see what a barrel proofed version of this infamous bourbon is like. This one is bottled at 129.6 proof.

The nose has an explosion of cooked red apples, cotton candy sweetness, baking spices, oak,  and freshly baked bread. 

The palate is sweet and oily with fresh apples,  leather, oak, sweet caramel, baking spices, corn and brown sugar. It’s also fairly drying on the palate, which is common with higher proof bourbons.

The finish tingles down your jawline, and the top of the throat for a long finish with lingering vanilla, fruit and spices.

Man, this is so delicious. Even though it’s not a fair comparison to regular old Blanton’s at a modest 93 proof, I had to compare. And the Straight From The Barrel is just insanely better, to be expected. If you have the opportunity to get ahold of one of these under $200, go for it!"
5.0,Best mouthfeel I’ve had on a bourbon. Felt and tasted buttery. Great barrel presence and heat followed by caramel and spices. Very long finish as well. Landed a great bottle!
