4.75,"Apple pie in a bottle, and not the moonshine type. Crisp apple taste with a sweet cinnamon hint. One of the best blends by compass box in my opinion"

4.25,"This is the second of two Compass Box drams I enjoyed at Persimmon in Providence.  See my review of The Circle for info about the other.

I don't have much experience with brandy in general, and French brandy in particular.  But the idea of mixing calvados and scotch seemed interesting.  

And interesting it is.  The nose is pastries and honey, and the palate is more pastries, baking spices and raisin.  It's smooth and rounded. It's also sweet, but not sticky or overly sweet in any respect.  The barrel notes seem to come primarily from the calvados and sherry in the casks, with little influence from the oak itself.

Overall, I wouldn't say I was blown away, as I can be with Compass Box.  But it's a very unique and worthy dram."
