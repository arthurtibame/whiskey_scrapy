3.75,"Color: white wine. 

Nosing the cap: smoked sardines, Parma ham, salt and smoke. Iodine and charred bloody meats. In the glass, some sense of being like a very good mezcal - grilled salted artichokes grilled with chili peppers and some small white oily fish. 
With water: brings out more vanilla, chocolate mints, medicinal. Some cinnamon?

Palate: salt and meat, followed by coffee, followed by some vanilla and canned pineapple. With water: salt, more peppery, medicinal and less on the pineapple. 

Finish: salted and sweet dried pineapple and iodine. With water : more medicinal less pineapple"
