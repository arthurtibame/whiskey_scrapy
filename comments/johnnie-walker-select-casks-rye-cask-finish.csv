4.0,Nothing like a scotch at all but possibly a good entry into scotch for the bourbon drinker.
4.0,Nice spice finish. Fairly different than most Johnnie Walkers throughout the taste. Going in expecting normal Walker scotch flavoring came out loving the tinge of rye finish.
4.0,"This blended scotch was intended for the USA, and when you nose it for the first time you'll realize they tried to mimic the Jack Daniels No.7. 

If you pour Jack Daniels no 7 and this in two glasses, you might have a hard time to figure which one is the Johnnie Walker.

Actually, Jack Daniels is a little better. it has the same Grape aroma but the peatyness is different, because Jack Daniels is made of charcoal and JW made of peat, making the smoke aroma a little different.

On the palate is hot, Oily, Salty, Smokey, with a very distinctive wheat flavor. the finish is short-medium with nice spicy sensation, but small bodied. It is a nice Scotch, intended to steal some of Jack Daniels Market in Usa."
4.0,"With a dash, sweet but ends with a spicy note.  Vanilla & oak with just a touch of peaty smoke"
4.0,"Fairly smooth and balanced. Nice value, paid $38 in NJ. Green label is my clear favorite from this line but this is a decent bottle at a good price."

4.0,"Very interesting! Accomplishes exactly what intends to. Nose is classic Johnnie, that is until a strong blast of spicy rye comes in. Taste follows the nose: oak, peat, cherry, and a little chocolate hit the palate followed by a burst of rye that lingers quite some time. Finish lingers for awhile and has more than a whiff of bourbon about it...enough that bourbon / American whiskey drinkers will appreciate this one, even if they don't normally like scotch. Wouldn't buy it as a mainstay scotch, but worth the splurge if adding something unique to a collection."

4.0,The rye comes through on the nose. This is a whiskey starts out like a Speyside and finishes like a rye with hints of mint and rye spiciness.  A very enjoyable expression.
4.0,Nose is all rye with a faint waft of malt. The palate is a well balanced note of rye and malt. I can't detect the smoke walker is mostly known for but I find this to be a balanced and smooth expression. Any rye drinker would be well advised to give this a try.

5.0,"Better neat than with water. A smooth, sweet core that has a significant spicy/peppery profile from the rye. Absolutely lovely. I'm not a huge American whiskey fan but this bridges the gap nicely. edit: The more I have this whiskey the more I love it. I've bought a few more bottles for when they stop making it. It's a really nice mix of rich, sweet, spice/pepper, and vanilla."

4.0,"[4.20.2016] Found this gem at O'Reilly's in Ft. Wayne and knocked off their bottle. Fantastic smokey rye that is uncharacteristic of Johnny Walker. Grand Traverse's ""islay"" is certainly better but the deep smoke aftertaste of this dram is fantastic.  Otherwise, simple, almost Irish. But when you take that sip and the brisket-smoke sets in, you realize this drink is money in the bank."

4.0,"An initial opening of bourbon notes (am I nosing a Scotch?) of vanilla, corn and rye, however all  faint.  The longer it opens the stronger and more pronounced the vanilla notes become.  A soft palate delivers a peppery body and a touch of sweetness of brown sugar or caramel.  The rye notes are discernible, but not too overt and very pleasant.  The sweetness subsides and finishes warm and spicy with a touch of oak.  The rye is revealed in the finish exposing a bit of spearmint.  A nice easy dram and adds a unique twist to the scotch. I have always been partial to Johnnie Walker as it is my starter and gateway scotch brand leading me into single malts.  I have not been interested in their other whisky's in their line as I think the ppv does not warrant purchase.  However, they have done right with this whisky: 46% abv, an age statement, price and quality make this a good for a collection.  [$44][88/100][Opened: 4/3/16; 4/20/16]"

4.0,"Johnnie Walker Select Casks: Rye Cask Finish is a limited release from Diageo that, unlike many of JWs recent expressions, has an age statement on it (10 Years). There's been a handful of hybrid releases lately (I'm thinking of Glenfiddich's bourbon-cask finished 14 year old) so I was interested to see how this stacked up.  The first thing I noticed when I put my nose in the glass was the extremely dominate rye whiskey notes. I would be curious to know just how long this was finished in those rye casks because they definitely make their presence known. When you taste the scotch, the palate is yet again dominated by rye spices. There's also vanilla and caramel and, on the finish you get the expected Johnnie Walker sea-salt/maritime flavor.  If I had to guess, I would say that the blend that they used had a lower proportion of Islay scotches - either that or the rye completely drowned out the peat notes here. The interplay with the spicy rye flavors and the aforementioned sea-salt note makes this a very intriguing hybrid expression. I liked it!  I wonder what's next for Johnnie Walker's Select Casks range... a sherry or port cask finished expression, perhaps?"
3.0,"My first thought that this was just a silly gimmick. And don't get me wrong: it *is* certainly a silly gimmick (I suspect JW has long been using ex-rye barrels; they've just been treated as indistinguishable from ex-bourbon barrels--until now, when American whiskey has become huge business worth cashing in on). But it's also not a bad little blend, and (despite my doubts) a bit of the spicy, herbal, ""green"" American rye character actually *does* come through. Smell is vanilla, toffee, some interesting funk (reminiscent of something I've encountered in Nikka whiskeys before), bubblegum, caramel, clove, light baking spice, mint. Taste is pretty soft, with vanilla, clove, some generic fruitiness, and herbacious bite. A bit of dry wood that lingers on into the finish, along with some burnt caramels. We're not talking a world-class whisky here, but the novelty, the semi-craft presentation (46% ABV, though chill-filtered), semi-reasonable price ($45 USD), and otherwise limited selection at a lot of airport duty-free shops makes it a fairly attractive option for home-consumption or gifting alike. Splits the difference between the American and Scotch whisk(e)y categories--the sweetness and herbaciousness of a bourbon/rye, the delicacy of a scotch blend."

4.0,"While not being a big fan of rye whiskey in general, I was a bit apprehensive about buying this bottle.  Rye spices are too overpowering (IMHO) and really keep me from enjoying most American rye whiskeys.  

So I decided to try this version of the JW Select because I haven't had it before and it was relatively cheap ($40/750ml).

Decent rye spice on the nose and palate, while still smooth on the finish.  I believe it's 10yo JW that was finished in ex-rye casks for just a month or so.  That's all the time it needed to pick up what I consider an acceptable amount of rye-ness.  Good spice level that finishes smooth and short.  It lingers just long enough until you're ready for another sip.  Solid overall and recommended.  Cheers."

4.0,"About a third of the way through the bottle and I am really beginning to appreciate this expression. On the nose, not much, grain liquor, sweet, spice. I was worried the Rye influence wouldn’t work...wrong. It’s very well balanced. I get a sweet vanilla, but not overly sweet that transitions to a briny peppery finish that is really delicious.  I wouldn’t hesitate to pick up another bottle...especially since it isn’t expensive. Great value."

3.5,"Nose: Vanilla, toffee, fruits and spice - all enjoyable but a tad too generic.

Palate: Vanilla, toffee,fruit and spice again.

Finish: Short, but smooth and refined.

This is very much a whisky cut from the same cloth as the cheaper Johnnie Walker Blenders' Batch Red Rye Finish blend. That whisky has a strong bourbon/rye character, particularly on the palate, but although the story is essentially the same here everything is elevated to a higher level and the result is more subtle.

The cheaper Blender's Batch Rye is more obviously bourbon/rye influenced, particularly in the palate, and is priced at a point where it is a valid alternative to many bourbon, rye and scotch blends that will primarily or exclusively be used as mixers.

However this whisky is up against the likes of Compass Box blends, Johnnie Walker Double Black, Glen Grant 10 year old, etc. It's a tough market point and at that price there is not actually a lot to recommend it. For a few bucks more you can buy JW Green Label, and that's the real issue - who would buy it in preference to the alternatives?

Nice enough stuff but overpriced as a mixer, and lacking the finesse of a whisky you'd want to drink neat.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"
