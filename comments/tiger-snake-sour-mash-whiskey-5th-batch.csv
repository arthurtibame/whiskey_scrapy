5.0,"Australian Whiskey always cops a bit of flack for being more expensive but in this case, it’s well worth it

Tiger Snake is a brilliant take on the bourbon style of whisky and the vanilla soaked almond note is phenomenal.
Easy to drink neat or with a dash of water (if you must) but is also a great mixer for that special evening with friends.

5 stars, my favourite whiskey!"

3.0,"This is not bad but I just can't justify the price with so many top whiskies in the price range. This is sweet and clean and that's as good as it gets
