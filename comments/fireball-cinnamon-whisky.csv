The bar I go to for the games would comp fireball shots for the house every time the Hawks scored... They won the cup a couple times here so you can imagine how many of these I've had lol. Either way, it's obviously a candy liquor. Its not something that purists are going to like but its an easy and fun party shot to get your buzz on before you go back to drinking more refined liquors. Take it for what it is and dont try to compare it to real whiskeys. Enjoy!"

5.0,"Review transfer from Barreled from April 2017. 

I figured it's finally time to do a review of Fireball. A ""Whiskey with natural cinnamon flavor"" according to the 50ml miniature bottle I have. This NAS whiskey is 33% ABV. I do believe it is chill filtered and has colorant added. 

Wow!  Incredible cinnamon on the nose. Red Hot candies, a big ol cinnamon stick shoved up your nose. There is some elegant oak behind it once you get acclimated to the big cinnamon. Hints of maple syrup, pine, roasted nuts, and some unexpected mango and pineapple. It's really a wonderful nose worth spending all day on. 

The palate is even better!  Like there's a party in my mouth and everyone just celebrated the New Year. Big Red gum, Atomic Jaw Breakers are the dominate notes, but my oh my there is so much more!  Blackberries, figs, vanilla cake, chocolate cake, red velvet cake, Pop Rocks with Coke. Unbelievable!  

The finish of everlasting and full of oak and cinnamon. Can't get enough

What can I say?  It's just one of those whiskies that redefines what it is to be a whiskey. Oh and the best part is...


April Fools!!  
But seriously, this stuff is horrible and should be avoided unless you are tailgating or at a party with a bunch of 22 years olds, which should also be avoided. It's ridiculously sweet and full of artificial cinnamon flavoring with none of the notes I mentioned.   1 star"

Dec. 27

I think this was either a joke or just an attempt to make me suffer after my Dickel Tobasco experience, but either way, this one comes by request from BeppeCovfefe. Thanks!

Nose: Red Hots.

Body: syrupy sweet. Tastes of poorly made cinnamon pancakes. There’s certainly the cinnamon, overly done, but there’s also a maple syrup sweetness there.

Finish: %¥?#. Unpleasant. It honestly kinda turns your stomach.

I remember that there was a time in college where this was used as a penalty whiskey during drinking games. Doing this now, I think attempting to taste this with sincerity might be worse than just pounding the damn thing. It does kinda make your stomach hurt. I honestly prefer the Dickel Tobasco. There was some interesting stuff in small doses there. This one is suffering from the first sip. Imma go find some tums.

Edit: after whining out loud about my tasting experience, my buddy told me to stop being a kitty cat and pound the rest of my glass. After doing so, I can say with confidence that this whiskey was made for pounding, not sipping. 

‘Tis the season. I don’t know if I actually have 4 more new whiskeys lined up, so if you’re reading this and there’s something readily available out there you’d like me to enjoy/suffer through this holiday season, leave it in the comments."

Yes it is sweet for a whiskey, but I didn’t think excessively since it is a flavored whiskey. I liked it, but you have to be in the mood for what it is. If you love the atomic fireball candy you will like this, if you don’t you won’t."
