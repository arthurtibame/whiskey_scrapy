4.0,"This is definitely an interesting dram. Banana, coconut, vanilla, lemon and more jumping out in this one, rounded out by light spiciness. Quite nicely done. I can see why they won awards. It's released by the Chapel Gate Whiskey Co. Not to sure where they sourced this stuff from but they picked the casks well. Only 400 bottles released i believe. @1901 I see you added the entry so i'm guessing you have a bottle or sample of this lying around?"
