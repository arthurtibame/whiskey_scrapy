4.25,Galenstein pick #1. Medium spice. Pretty smooth for a rye.

4.0,"My first experience with Bone Snapper was Christmas 2013 ( I think) in Indiana. 
  My father-in-law had a bottle of batch #1. It was amazing. Since then, Batch #1, #2 and #3  has become my personal standard of a good rye. I carry a flask with me always to share with new and old bartender friends. And it helps when looking for a new whiskey on my travels. Three sips: First sip is like a bitch slap to the face. You go back for a second and by the third sip things settle in for good evening of enjoying the snapper. 
   Batch #4 was disappointing - all bone no snap. But now they are distributing all the way out here to CA. Keeping an eye out for the early batches and hanging on dearly to the bit that I do have left of each."

3.0,"First sample was a really solid rye, but when I purchased a bottle it tasted like a mold bomb. I've been scared to go back to this ever since, and have only recently purchased their X-Ray Rye (which is a HUGE improvement, upper 80s score from me on that one). This one however, I can't justify rating higher than mid 70s based on the fact that while one pour was great, the bottle was trash. From what I remember though, the other review that says ""Peppery hot with sweet cinnamon cakey flavors"" is spot on; add in some smoother vanilla notes and that's where my pour was at."
