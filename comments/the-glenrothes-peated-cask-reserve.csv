3.0,"Does what it says on the tin -- it's a soft Speyside Scotch with a peaty finish. Pretty good value if it's $50-60. Sampled June 15, 2016 at Whisky Jewbilee."

3.0,"Light peat smoke and fresh mint on the nose. Medium bodied, with toffee, lemon rind, nutmeg, and black pepper on the palate. Medium length finish. Despite its complexity, the combination of flavours in this whisky were a little weird for me."
3.0,"A pleasant nose, lightly peated with peppermint notes - you can tell the peat is only coming from the casks and not the distilling process. The palate has no salt or smoke, with toasted barley, wood spices, and brown sugar notes.

 I kinda like it."

3.75,"My review might be skewed, because it sounds like I got hell of deal on this. This is a fine scotch though for someone who wants to dip their toes into the peat realm. The peat is there but it's not overpowering, and it's also not medicinal. It's smoky enough to give it some character. Also has the classic sherried speyside notes, so it it remains ever so sweet. I get more of a cedar wood. I'm not picking up the mint notes other have indicated. Overall, I think this is a great speyside, and I might have to pick up another bottle for $25."

4.0,"so great, nicely balance with the peat, still keeps the glenrothes characteristic, the peat only added to the character here."
3.0,Tastes a bit watered down but a pleasant dram. My first Scotch purchase so I keep it around for sentimental reasons

4.0,"The nose is pretty drab and none explicit, but on the other hand the taste is unique. The peat that comes through slightly in the lingering taste, is truly magnificent!"
2.75,"Bright malty aroma, love the smell. Light leather smell, super into it. Super light and thin body. No burn, but super passive flavors. Grassy floral undertone. If I didn't know any better I'd say it was Irish without question."
3.25,Surprisingly smooth. No smell of smoke but you can taste it. Not overpowering. Combined with lemon and smoke
4.0,"I have been curious about this malt, but in my area it goes for $70-80---just not that curious to go in blind. Then I found a Minnesota online shipper selling it for $25; then, on New Year's Day they had one day free shipping special. Who of weak will could resist that? Pouring neat it is a light straw color. Nose is sweet, citrus/floral, with a whiff of peat. On the tongue these are all evident. Mouthfeel is light, typical of malts from tall stills such as those of Glenrothes and Glenmorangie. In fact, except for the peat, this reminds me of Glenmorangie 10. Coming from the former Islay casks used to age this malt, the peat is not a peat-bomb, but is a nice smoky accent. I prefer this at cool to room temperature to allow all the floral esters to be available. Chilled in the frig it is much less complex and the peat rules more on the tongue. I am enjoying this very much. I appreciate that some distillers such as Glenrothes and Spey do a longer, slower fermentation to allow their yeasts to develop those floral notes."

3.75,"Nose: Barley, cereal grain.  Cheerios.  Distant vanilla.

Palate: Honey Nut Cheerios   Peachy banana fruit like flavors.  Whisps of smoke lacing throughout.  Minty sweet vanilla, especially on the finish."
4.5,Nice caramelly body with a pleasant peaty aftertaste
3.0,Mild peat. Watered down fruity sweetness.

2.0,Yeah the weak reviews here are unfortunately accurate. Not really peat and just not really enjoyable. Had this at my monthly scotch tasting.
2.5,"Very light sugary aroma. Thin mouthfeel, vaguely vanilla with medium peat finish. 

Not terribly interesting."
5.0,Very smooth. I get a caramelized nose. Sweet and smooth palate. Very very light peat. Finish is short but nice.

3.0,"A little disappointed, not as complex as I am expecting. Sweet and lots of vanilla on palate, but not much aroma."
