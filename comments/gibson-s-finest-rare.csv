3.0,"Gibson’s Rare (12), Canadian Whisky.  82 pts. This was left behind by a friend that uses it for mix, and I can see why.... I would never have guessed that it’s 12 years old and only 40%. Initial bite has some lasting heat. There’s a coarseness from the rye, with underlying sweet toffee, citrus rind and cloves."

2.0,"Not too shabby, pretty harsh smelling and initial tasting notes. Great value!"
2.75,"Sweet nose, easy on the pallet, spicey cinnamon finish.

Update: having had more whiskeys since trying, amending my initial review to a lower rating for consistency of scale."
