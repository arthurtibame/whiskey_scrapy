1.5,"Chocolate, butterscotch and tobacco nose. Relatively spicy with an aftertaste of the morning after a night of smoking cigars.

I use the rating scale below. Distiller uses a scale of 5 and I use a scale of 10, but I’m sure you’re not too drunk to do the math! 

1. Disgusting - So bad I poured it out.
2. Poor - I wouldn't consume by choice.
3. Bad - Multiple flaws.
4. Below average - Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.
5. Good - Just average.
6. Very Good - Better than average.
7. Great - Well above average.
8. Excellent - In a league of its own.
9. Incredible - An all-time favorite.
10. Perfect"

3.0,Enjoy it better than their standard bourbon.  Found it to be a perfect mixer in ginger ale. Have to watch the proof though! 😀. Batch 14-0058. Bottle 66.
