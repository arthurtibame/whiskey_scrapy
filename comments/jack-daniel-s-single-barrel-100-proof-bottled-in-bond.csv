4.0,"The 50%  ABV was a very pleasing strength.  More intense flavour and kick than a typical 40% whisky, but not so  overpowering as some cask strength whiskies can be - right in the sweet spot.  The most prominent taste for me is brown sugar - I can't pick out the other flavours in the background.  This is very good, but not cheap either (US$56 at the dutyfree).  I'll enjoy drinking this, but I wonder if there are better values at this pricepoint.   We'll see how I feel when the bottle is finished ;)"

4.0,"Dry, bananas always present, definetely potent, fruity, full flavored, I’m not quite decided yet if 50% abv is something I appreciate. The alcohol is really coming through. I’m writing this post with my first drink of this bottle, maybe it’s just an acquired taste."
3.5,Much fuller flavored and richer than standard JD or Gentleman... a respectable whiskey in its own right.
2.75,really strong. needs a couple drops of water.

4.5,"Not like any other JD I've had. World's better than No 7, and Gentlemen Jack. Highly recommended"
3.0,"A good next step for whiskey beginners. It introduces a few more interesting notes on the nose and palate and emphasizes oak flavors. The nose has an interesting combo of oak, leather and vanilla. The palate is a similar situation with the usual vanilla but with some banana and strong oak spice. This whiskey isn't very hot and has a medium palette. Overall great value but nothing to crazy or complex."

4.25,"A higher proof, retail exclusive JD single barrel edition,  one that mantains the Jack Daniel's Profile, you can easy guess it is from them with just smelling it, but it actually delivers some clean tasting notes that make it a very enjoyable dram. 

Bottled at 50%abv (100% proof).

The nose is a little dull. Bananas, red fruits a d maraschino cherries. Maybe some maple syrup.

The palate is very nice. Very smooth. The typical charcoal JD note, mixed with bananas and some nuttiness.

Aftertaste is also very nice. Is where most of the notes are found. Pepper, Oak spice, Sawdust, Dulce de leche and Hints of smoke.

Overall this is a good dram, and maybe a collectible item if you are a Jack Daniel's fan. 82/100."
3.25,"Quick hit review. I wasn't a JD fan to begin with and this is same as std at higher strength from what I remember. Cloying sweetness and goes down easy, I couldn't be bothered drinking the rest.. the kitchen sink took one for the team."
