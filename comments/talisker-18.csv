3.5,85. Totally appreciate the significantly complex taste of this scotch...and that it's not at all peaty like the 10 year. Definitely something I'd like to get in my cabinet. Don't let the nose fool you...much tastier than it smells.

Oh so not for the newly initiated into the world of single malts.  This will add a bit hair to your chest.  In a good way.  It's expensive though, much more expensive than a typical 18 year old  (unless of course it's Macallan).   But, this is so much better than your typical 18 yr old.  If you come across this...you have to try it."

4.0,"Same ABV as the 10 year, which is surprising. It's very good, but do I notice an 8 year difference with the 10? Not so sure. It is a ""thicker"" and more coating mouth feel. A touch spicier, and a longer finish. I guess I talked myself into it. I think I am missing the floral properties, which is not big on my list, but maybe I will learn to appreciate that aspect more as my palate matures in time."

5.0,"I received this as a Christmas gift a over a year ago and have been waiting for a special moment to open it, which did finally arrive (birthday and graduations).  I originally only briefly sampled this at a whisky tasting, and although it was sampled in plastic and with a small amount, I fell in love.  I finally got to sit down and take it all in.
   
  This is lightly apple juice colored with long legs.  The aromas are all light and not overpowering,  but you can detect all the notes.  The first scent is that of lightly charred sooty cedar.  Exploring past the smoky notes, sweet, real maple syrup, toffee and brine blend in.  A bit further and more time coffee and honeysuckle swirl about.  All the aromas are delightfully blended and makes for a wonderful bouquet. 
   
  In a medium-light body, the arrival is sweet, salty and smoky like hickory-smoked brown sugared bacon...nice!  The arrival seques to a slightly spiced black pepper and ginger root.  Cocoa and tropical fruit of pineapple and toasted coconut, toffee and milk chocolate rounds out the the flavors and the mix of salt, sweet and spice make a wonderful balanced palate.  As it fades, charred oak is delivered to the finish.
   
  The finish is wonderfully long.  Oak, lemon zest and a medium-bodied-style cigar ash/charcoal remain.  A slightly warming black pepper spice and spearmint are the last remnants to close the delightful experience.
   
  The variety and balance of aromas and flavors is amazing.  Not an overpowering, smoky whisky like the 10 year old version; not too sweet or spicy.  The flavors are so mingled and yet discernible.  Complex and approachable.  An exemplar whisky.  [Dry glass: Melted caramels] [95/100][Tasted: 6/17/17]
   
  -------------------------------------------------
  Initial Tasting: 10/15/2014 : I recall thinking, Wow!  after tasting.  Smokey, salty Talisker signature nose, but not overpowering. On the palate, sweet smoke, brine and pepper.  Rich, creamy, full body.  Spicy warm finish.  A mature, extremely well-balanced dram.  One for the collection. [$139]

Talisker 18

No review tonight. I just wanted to sip one of my favorite scotches on the eve of some emotional days waiting ahead.  Sipping in a calm just reflecting as my favorite mother in law, too soon, passed.  Hectic few days so far. Up and down emotions; reminiscing some memories as we wait for our son to arrive.  Just wanted something good and special as we remember a strong, loving, caring woman who will be missed. [8/11/19]"

5.0,"Rather than dark amber color like 10 yo, Talisker 18 has light golden color. Smell is really light, with slight peat and sweetness coming in. On palate there's honey, caramel, cinnamon, and hint of brine, but all very subtle, along with sweet peat that's not dominating, but noticeably delicate. Finish is medium and sweet. 

This is a really sophisticated scotch with a lot of flavors, but balanced really well and has interesting profile than any other scotches I've had so far. Definitely worth the money($190 after tax)."

5.0,"Visual:  In the glass it is a deep gold. Long, thin legs after a swirl. They linger for a while.

Nose:  The 45.8% ABV is not readily apparent. The first nosing reminds me of holiday cider enjoyed next to a crackling fire: apples and nutmeg with faint, fragrant smoke. Nosing deeper pulls in darker aromas of charred wood, old wooden building, and a waft of pine needles. The nose is not as medicinal as the 10-year expression.

Palate: The palate comes on sweet and salty, with malty sweetness followed by some sea spray and mild iodine.  A little bit of kettle popcorn comes through mid-palate.

Finish:  Much like its younger brother, the 10-year, the 18 finishes long, warm, and satisfying, with some salt and lingering mild medicinal notes.

The empty glass smells like a bowl of candied nuts on a varnished table in a library full of old books – with coffee brewing down the hall.

In my opinion, it does not present quite as spectacular a sensory experience as the 10-year does. I think the time in the barrel tamed it a bit and perhaps took a little of the fun out of it...That said, it is an excellent whisky, and still comforting to the senses. It just isn’t quite as intense as the 10. Still a five-star dram for sure."

4.0,"I loved the 10 so was hoping this would blow me away.  It didn't quite do that, but it's a lovely dram nonetheless.  The nose is somewhat generic for a scotch, and I wouldn't be able to pick it out as a Talisker.  There's some chalky gravel and a light touch of smoke to the nose, but the more enduring notes are malt, orange, and apple (not much different than a lot of Highland scotches).  In the background, I detect some jasmine.  Talisker's signature note is pepper, and it remains prominent even after all those years of development in the barrel.  The fruit transforms into sweet plum, and this scotch has an oily, waxy mouthfeel that's quite unique.  Then there is a huge, musky floral note that hits right at the swallow.  After a slight letdown on the nose, this scotch makes a strong comeback here.  Talisker 18 ends with stronger notes of smoke and salt than are present in its flavor profile, although those flavors are still counterbalanced by more floral notes (so in this respect I agree with the Distiller notes).  The smoke that emerges on the finish is reminiscent of an older Islay scotch like Laphroaig 18, where it has mellowed out into a toasty, leathery scent rather than being acrid and sharp.  There's a cool, interesting, hoppy end, which resembles an IPA.  The finish is the best part of this scotch because it lingers with some mild but noticeable features for a long time, and yet it never grows unpleasant, overly bitter, or too drying."

5.0,"Nose: Gentle but very complex. Honey sweetness, bright citrus - like orange, lemon, and grapefruit influence, sea salt like standing by the fresh sea breeze. Warm soft smoke lingers in the background-reminiscent of pleasant pipe tobacco and camp smoke. There’s also a sweet character which reminds me of sherry cask influence in the DE, though I’m 95% sure there’s no sherry in this whisky.

I could take in this aroma all day.

Palate: Honey sweetness and orange citrus at the front. The whisky warms up gently as sea salt flavors emerge and the characteristic black pepper shows up. The finish is long, lingering, and it demands another sip - leaving behind honey and citrus sweetness and billows of mellow pipe smoke finally appear at the end. This one stays with you.

Amber colored and medium bodied, this whisky has a mouthfeel like melting chocolate - smooth, full, and silky.

This is a perfect single malt. Everything Talisker 10 does so well is elevated and perfect in 18. Just give it some time in the glass- it does get better with time!"
5.0,"Color: Amber

Nose: Gentle but complex. Honey and bright citrus with salt and subtle smoke.

Palate: Exquisite smoke wafting over sweet salt toffee, but not burdened by caramel heaviness. Sweet, but not heavy honey - more like malty milk chocolate and light syrup. Suddenly, the trademark Talisker kick of chili or ground dry red pepper appears.

Finish: Medium. The salty/sweet/spicy smoke fades away gracefully leaving a subtle fruity-smoke and brine aftertaste.

This is whiskymaking of the highest quality, and one of my top shelf malts. So amazingly well balanced and assured with great depth and poise. Power, but with finesse of expression.

Adding a dash of water makes this so enticingly drinkable it is almost dangerous. Marvellous stuff.

4.0,I was lucky to get this bottle as a  birthday present from my whiskey mates (well a voucher for whiskey which I spent on this). I've had it open for a week now tasting here and there. So far I'm with Dreaming of Islay and Telex on this one. I like it. It's a mellower more refined version of the 10. But is it better than the 10 given the price or even at all. At this stage the answer is no and no for me. I have a feeling with more time open it'll improve further. I tried this after the Bowmore 18 which after a number of months open was beautiful probably at its peak so I have a feeling the scenario will play out similar for the Talisker 18. Update. After trying other drams including Craigellachie 13 and Glengas Torfa I think this drams new make is just more harsher / astringent / bitter. I think I'll actually drop this to barely a 4. I just confirmed this by trying the 10....it rules hands down for me. Much richer without the astringency...not sure whether the richness masks it or not or I got lower quality new make in the batch of the 18. And update 2. Many months later it's got  better still and the bitterness has faded. Lovely mild pepper honey viscosity.

Talisker 18 has the briny, peaty and peppery notes that the distillery is known for but this time a little tamed by the age.
It also has a very pleasant sweet and citrus (oranges) notes.

To sum it up, this whisky has it all, just incredible stuff. Hands down my favourite whisky!! (At a reasanoble price)

4.0,"Original review from March 2016:

A drop or two of water really opens this up like a BBQ pit.  I don't get the sea salt notes like most Islay single malts, but damn it finishes very smoky and smooth.  It's like a long, fireside chat that you wish wouldn't end.  I could sip on this with a big ole grin until I pass out.

Update April 2018:

I didn’t transfer the original review above from a couple of years ago because I didn’t do as thorough of a job as I like to do now.  But, as luck would have it, my buddy @Generously_Paul recently sent me a fresh pour of this one so I could do a proper review.

The problem was that he was using a preservation gas on this bottle before sending me another sample and we both agree that it had a negative effect on his bottle.

What I do remember most is the deep, smokiness that permeates the entire sip from nose to finish.  Paul’s sample felt like it has gone somewhat flat and it really suppressed all the barrel and sea notes I’ve grown to expect from every Talisker.  I remember my original bottle really being a quality whisky, so I still feel comfortable giving this 4.5 stars, but I guess I’m going to have to find another pour somewhere if I really want to sit down and update my notes completely.  One day I’ll seek out another bottle.  I still highly recommend this one.  Cheers and thanks for reading through what is essentially a Seinfeld review- I basically didn’t write anything about the whisky, lol.  Now, where’s my residual check @Distiller?"

5.0,"Review transfer from Barreled from October 2016. 

Wow. This is one fantastic scotch. Simply amazing. Now for the non superlative stuff...

Typical 45.8% ABV for Talisker. It is an amber gold color. It appears to have some colorant added but hard to tell since it is a blend of ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks. No word on if it is chill filtered but the slightly oily mouthfeel would suggest that there may not be. Or at most some light chill filtration. 

The nose is so complex and sophisticated for a Talisker. Dark berries, plumbs, figs, a hint of light pears and even underripe bananas. Subtle oak spices, toffee, vanilla, orange oil. Low levels of smoky goodness. No alcohol burn. Absolutely wonderful. 

The palate is sweet with sherried fruits. Lightly peppered that intensifies the more you drink it. Oaky with some smoke. More of a bonfire smoke than cold ash smoke. They took the wild nature of the 10 YO, tamed it, sweetened it, matured it and sent it to finishing school. I could drink this all day. 

This is incredibly smooth and drinkable. At $165 per bottle it's not for everyday, but this will be my go to for special occasions. Today being my birthday, I'm happy to have reviewed this amazing scotch. If the 25 and 30 year olds are better than this I may not be able to handle it. 4.75 but only because I would have liked more smoke.  Cheers!"

5.0,"Day 9. Talisker 18. The 10 is a mainstay in my collection, simply a great dram. This...is even better. 

The nose is rather humble, no hint at what's about to happen. Salt, Peat, and a bit of fresh cut grass. 

The taste on the other hand...I'm in heaven. Honey, Salt, Pepper, and that's just the opening salvo. There are a whole basked of fresh juicy sweet fruits in there...apples, pears...peaches? Something along those lines. The Talisker typical (at least for me) cereals make an appearance, although slightly toned down. There is also a hint of the medicinal peat and a bit of burn from the ABV. Just enough to make things interesting. 

The aftertaste is a fruity sweetness combined with medicinal bitterness and a dash of salt. Awesome. 

Talisker nails it again. 

The next couple of days will be interesting. I peeked....all I say is, after this, we got Dalmore and Lagavulin. Not going to be disappointed I think."

5.0,"This is a re-taste of the same bottle that I reviewed about a year ago when it was freshly opened.  It was finally nearing the end, so the time came to put it out of its misery.
        
        Nose: Aromatic smoke that is not as oily/bracken-scented as an Islay, nor soft and heathery like an Orkney.  It is uniquely maritime and briny, being reminiscent of the smell of a steamship. There are also warm baking spices and nutty fragrances of fresh-baked ginger snaps and an underpinning meaty heft. A faint menthol/camphor note cements everything else together. Beautiful aromatic articulation.
        
        Palate: An arrival of exquisite, complex smoke wafting over hard salt toffee. Faintly anise rather than caramel heavy but softened with a touch of honey-water, dusky orange and milk chocolate. The trademark Talisker kick of hot ginger and chili powder appears in the mid development but it’s mellow and refined here in comparison to the powerhouse that is the 10 year old.
        
        Finish: Medium/long, the salty/sweet/spicy smoke echoes away into the distance.
        
        This whisky remained stable throughout its life in the bottle, the final dram being very like the first. I did generously flood the bottle with argon gas after each opening, which most likely helped to reduce oxidization, but even so it was extremely consistent.
        
        It’s an amazingly well balanced and assured whisky with great depth. The nose is both assertive and gently finessed - a steel fist in a velvet glove – and the palate is a joy. Talisker’s distillery character is midway between the earthy strength of Campbeltown, the robust smoke of Islay and the hefty, waxy meatiness of the upper-east coastal highlands.
        
        This is one of those whiskies that can only be tasted at the end of a flyte or followed by something even more magnificent, as it will eclipse any lesser dram.  It swims well and is delicious either neat or with a dash of water, as you prefer. This is an easily obtainable and relatively affordable desert island dram.
        
        ""Outstanding"" : 5 stars"

4.25,"I am continually annoyed when my tasting notes ride the app review's coattails.

In this case my first big impression was candied orange and ginger. The peat is more of a sigh than a shout. Glazed ham, pepper, fennel, and spicy gingersnap cookies round out the flavor. The lingering note is the orange and spice. The whisky is not overly sweet, but is reminiscint of the rich, sweet food around Christmas time."

2.5,"Nose - This brings out so many spices, not the more standard wood price, but nut meg, cinnamon, pepper, and then it adds in this sweet oaked oak.  It's lovely.  

Taste - There's a subtly sweet body here, very middle of that road with caramel and light oak and then it brings out just a puff of smoke and then it finishes with this explosion of spices and alcohol heat.  It's even a touch spicy hot on the finish, and that's not the alcohol.  I have a feeling this bottle is still opening up and maturing, it's only been open a few weeks maybe a month (ok I can't remember when I bought it, but it hasn't been here that long).  Already it seems to have mellowed out some of the spice kick and gotten sweeter.  

I'm a bit torn, it's a bit expensive at 170 though I know talskers can be greatly different in price, had a friend get the 30 year for 300 for example.  It's rather tasty and rather good, but despite having a lot of different flavors and a nice transition to the finish I still feel it is a bit one dimensional and a bit too heavy on the spice and oak.  

Score 2.5.   Very good whisky but lacks the quality I'd want to make this a firm recommendation.  I haven't had the 10 in some time, but I don't believe I can fully support buying this based on being a huge fan of the 10 (the 30 I'll fully endorse at 300, it was awesome).  I'll certainly come back to this as the bottle opens and see if it warrants a adjustment (I have a few bottles in mind for updates)."

Just wanted something good and special as we remember a strong, loving, caring woman who will be missed. [8/11/19]"

4.5,"You can absolutely taste the oak but it doesn't overpower like some of the oakey speysides do. It is a different note from Talisker, refined and mature but still Talisker. I like it but will probably only keep the Distiller's edition or 10-year on hand after it is gone due to price/value. It may be too subtle for my palate to fully appreciate but through many more drinkings, I will endeavor to understand deeper."

Nose: light peat, smoke, warm and inviting. A hint of seaweed, salt, wafts of tobacco and sherry sweetness trying to sneak out. Really nice

Finish: medium to long. Pepper, peat, smoke and sweet.

4.5,"Call out your order to your snooty waiter in a swish restaurant and you'll more than likely hear him say: ""Ahhh, exquisite taste, Sir"".

If I was a barman and someone asked for a Talisker 18, I'd say the same thing.

Only I’d mean it. I’d really mean it.

The nose is more muted than I expected. It is beautifully briny, with some gentle, sweet smoke, ice cream (vanilla), and some light wood as the Glencairn empties. 

The taste is where this dram excels. I think @Reverend357 put it best: ""The nose is rather humble, no hint at what's about to happen"". Humble though the nose may be, the palate has the full-on charm, poise and purpose of Roger Livesey as Torquil MacNeil, Laird of Kiloran. 

Oily in the mouth, the flavours are orange, peat smoke, salty sweet, developing into strong black pepper - chillies even - really fiery I thought. The sweetness, long pepper, and tinge of smoke continues into the finish and are joined by some oak and particularly a lovely medicinal taste at the very, very end. 

I'm not a completist by any means, but with this dram I think Talisker may be my favourite distillery. Whether you're a woman, a man, or a single-celled organism; at some time or another, every living entity on this planet has to try a Talisker."

Au palais : doux, rond et amer avec du caractère, fumé, poivré et légèrement salé, tourbe caoutchouteuse avec une note marine et de saumon fumé et une note légère de biscuit apéritif, on note également une touche de citron vert. enfin vient en fin de verre une touche de cheminée que l’on viendrait d’éteindre très subtile 
La finale est moyen/court, profonde, fraîche, tourbée et mentholée 

Note personnelle : 91/100

Très bon whisky,une tourbe pas envahissante qui offre pourtant toute sa palette d’arômes, avec notamment une super finition marine qui représente à merveille la distillerie. Une superbe tourbe, de superbes notes salées et marine, le tout dans une douceur agréable sans pour autant manquer de caractère, un super équilibre mais un tout léger manque d’originalité qui l’empêche d’avoir une note encore meilleure comme le Lagavulin distillers éditions"

3.75,"Peppery, coffee and green notes and with Talisker's characteristics smoke and peat but not excessively overpowering"
4.75,"Widely recommended by many, award winner, i have been looking forward to finally tasting the 18yo expression of my favorite distillery. And even if i recognize it as the wonderful dram it is, i WOULD NOT BUY IT, and i am going to tell you guys why.

Amber color, classic talisker abv on this one: 45.8%.

The nose is like every other talisker: Peat, Spice, Salt, Not diferent from talisker 10yo at first. Then a Creamy vanilla and Herbal note appear. Nice but nothing new (here is where it lost the 3 points).

On the palate is so smooth that it is like if you where drinking water: Peppery, Orange, Caramel with spices nothing else but it doesn't need more. Smoothest talisker ever.

Finish is spectacular: ashy, smoky aboslutely balanced; salty, ginger.

It is exactly the Classic 10yo talisker but smoother, that is the only difference and i don't think it is enough for you to pay 2.5 times the price of the 10yo or the storm. 

Neverheless, this is a 97 over 100 still making Talisker the god of whisky brands. Slainte!!"

4.5,"Served neat from a full bottle into a Glencairn.

The nose is a familiar island whisky, but somehow polished and briny at the same time.  The spice and brine is equally offset by sweet floral notes.  Reminds me somewhat of Spanish brandy, just mildly peated.

Lush and thick mouth-feel, with a very mild spice that starts soft, yet never fully dies.  The citrus zest and spice are reminiscent of lemon mentholated candies (made with real lemons) from Southeast Asia.  The citrus and spice keep riding, picking up some clove and floral herbs for the ride.

The aftertaste is somewhat bittersweet, like a caramel-mochacchino brewed with heavily roasted Peruvian coffee.

While I am normally a fan of sherry-bombs (port pipes count, too), this holds it's own as a digestif.  It's not as intense or complex as the NAS Ardbegs, yet it is far more refined, while still retaining the attention getting character.  At this price point, there are other options that I would probably spend money on first, but this will definitely be revisited after this bottle runs out.

What a way to bring in the new year!"

4.5,"The color, inexplicably artificial, is deep gold with amber reflections.
The scent is intoxicating, delicate and enveloping: mineral peat bathed in the ocean, wrapped in a soft blanket of marzipan, candied orange and even dark chocolate. A fan of pepper and a splash of lemon complete a really rich sense of smell, where smoking is a gentle background and the sweet / salty balance caresses the nostrils. It would be an excellent air freshener, just a little expensive.
Peat and wood glide on the palate at the first sip, with oily elegance: again, the scents are far from aggressive, they envelop your palate revealing themselves sinuously. The contrast here is played on the sweet / bitter tune, with touches of licorice accompanied by caramel, candied orange and salted butter; chocolate returns, which recalls that of Modica with salt crystals that crack under the teeth. Pepper, generously dusted on everything. Meanwhile, puffs of smoke from Habana. Elegant and rich, layered, sensual.
The finish accompanies for a long time, embers on the shore, salt and pepper crystals."

5.0,"If Talisker isn't my favorite distillery, it's right up there. I formed that opinion after years of drinking the 10-year and never having the opportunity to try anything else. Now, after having had a couple variations, I think that opinion holds true more than ever.

Nose: Briny as they come; just what I expect of Talisker. Big seaweed, big sea salt. The ocean spray from a wave hitting the coastline displayed on the packaging could not be more fitting. Lighter on the smoke and peat, but still present. Honey, vanilla, toffee, malt, and a bit of milk chocolate. Roasted almonds and salted caramel. Orange and pineapple citrus. Amazing oak touch of oak. Some apple and pear, as well as marshmallow and jelly. I could go all day with this one. Superb.

Palate: More of those briny, sea salt, ocean spray notes. Peat and smoke are ramped up, but are still at medium intensity. Some savory meaty notes, as well as big caramel and milk chocolate. More apple, pear, orange, and pineapple. Vanilla, honey, and toffee. Honeydew and cantaloupe now as well. Beautiful oak once again. And the peat hits at the mid-palate. It's still not particularly smoky, but instead it's that black bean, red-pepper chili I've now come to associate with Talisker. Baking spices to boot: black pepper, cinnamon especially. Phenomenal.

Finish: Spice bomb. Sea salt, cinnamon, and black pepper. The chili is all in tact. Ginger makes an appearance. A healthy dose of oak. Vanilla fills in the cracks to bring what makes for a very long finish to a satisfying conclusion.

Absolute winner. Didn't even have to check the stats before awarding this a 5/5. This is one of the best whiskies I've ever had. Talisker doesn't provide a large pool of offerings, but everything they do have is stellar at worst.

As a whole, the Islands can hold their own with Islay. There is plenty to see here. Talisker 18 is quite easily one of the best bottles I've ever owned, and I'd urge any Scotch fanatic to buy without hesitation. It artfully tows the line between the world of intense coastal peat and the realm of eloquent, layered, and balanced malt. Well done, Talisker."

4.75,"Bought this about a month ago. Popped the cork but didn’t pour any and just let it breathe. Finally had a pour tonight, but only after letting it rest in the glass for about 20 minutes. 

A good buddy came over tonight and we had this as our highlight malt of the evening. We started with Glenkinchie 12, then some Talisker 10, moved on to this, then finished with some Tamdhu Batch Strength 002.  All fine pours but this was the obvious and clear highlight. 

This has everything we love about Talisker. The pepper, peat, and brine are all there, but the extra eight years in the barrel has mellowed it out quite a bit. Additionally, there’s an amazing butterscotch note that comes through on the nose and palate along with the faintest whisp of coffee. While the finish isnt quite as long as the ten year old, it’s brilliant while it is there. That Talisker warming sensation with the added buttercream. 

This is a special pour, and clearly only for special occasions, such as birthdays, holidays, weddings, etc. Not your everyday sipper, but a fine pour when it comes around. Well worth the investment for any Talisker fan. Cheers!"

3.5,"I haven’t had a Talisker in a while. But it didn’t take long to remember the style on the nose. The peachy peat. The lightly salted leather. Fresh dark damp soil. Red fruit juice. 

The palate though is a lot more intense than I remember it being from other younger Taliskers I had. Especially for a 18y this has quiet a kick. But after the initial but still very fruity sweet slap in the face it becomes really delicious and the finish is the typical Talisker again which is very much like the 10y - just richer and longer and in the end the rewarding saltiness Talisker is famous for. 

Very signature taste. And it gets better the further into the glass, which is also when the age starts to shine. It is a very good whisky and quite unique. Be careful with water though - it doesn’t take much to take away from the quality."
