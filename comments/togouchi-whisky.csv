1.75,Really strong sake flavor coming through and not good sake.  Not sure if it's the mix or what but barely drinkable for me.
2.0,Just not my tempo
1.5,This is probably the worst Japanese whisky I have tried. Extremely bland with very little flavor beyond straight malt alcohol taste. Luckily it was on my brother’s bar and had to pay nothing to try it.
