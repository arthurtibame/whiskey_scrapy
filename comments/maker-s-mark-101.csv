3.5,"It's good. Maybe a one trick pony. Cinnamon red hots. No barrel. I like it, but not enough here to justify the cost."

3.5,"Interesting. It has a Rye spice start, a wheat smooth middle, and then a classic Bourbon finish."
4.0,Wonderful to find this after so many years absence. I recently purchased this at the distillery. Great nose vanilla and caramel with nice mouth feel. I got sweet up front with a smooth finish of caramel apples which hangs around very nicely. I tested this with a single cube of ice from distilled/filtered water via Peak ice maker. This is my new favorite Bourbon for now.
4.0,Fantastic. Less Apple forward than regular makers. An upgrade over the normal stuff...just wish it was available outside of the distillery.

4.0,"Less sweet and less vanilla compared to the regular Maker’s Mark. Overripe banana and a slight hint of cherry on the nose. Toffee, vanilla and some spicy, peppery flavors. Cinnamon flavored batter. Interesting, but I think I prefer the regular edition to be honest. Medium finish."

Taste: Sweet, Nutmeg, Vanilla, Caramel, Some Spice"
3.5,Very good flavor. Cherry Vanilla bomb at a good proof that’s got just enough spice.

4.0,Caramel  and maybe some banana on the nose. Pleasantly soft and brown sugar sweet with cinnamon spice and a warm finish. Will pick up again the next time I’m at the distillery.

4.75,"Absolutely amazing nose. Deep caramels and sweet vanilla.
Taste is delightful, very similar to makers mark but much deeper flavors.
Finishes great for its abv, great Kentucky hug that has long hangtime. One of my favorite bourbons"
