4.5,"It has a strong opening flavor and it goes down really smooth.
(It reminds me of Dewar's 12 year with the taste)"

3.25,Very soft smell of fruit and nut. Has a quick burst of strong botanical taste with a quick smooth finish. That has a quick spicy dark chocolate after note.
3.5,Very light aromas on the nose. The lightness continues on the palate with sweet and floral notes as soon as it touches your palate and a spicy and herbal aftertaste. Great smooth and flavorful whiskey!

3.5,This scotch is fairly sweet and fruity with a little smokiness. I thoroughly enjoyed and would buy again.
2.5,"For the price, I’d purchase JW Black. Similar profile to JWB with less peat/smoke."

3.5,With my dad! That says it all
3.0,"Decent blended malt, different from the other Walker offerings. No grain or smoke involved. Sweeter on the nose and palate with definitely fruity mid palate. All in all a decent offering for $35USD plus a 10 year age  statement, what’s not to like?"
