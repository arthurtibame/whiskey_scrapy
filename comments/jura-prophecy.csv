4.0,"Nose: Smoke and peat, with peat dominating. Little bit of phenols. Sweet with hints of lemon zest. Water makes it floral.

Taste: Burnt toast and peat with lingering spices. Smooth, yet crispy with hints of lemon.

Finish: Cinnamon and rough peat. I like it!

Balance: Not a complex whisky but good. Gets the same score from me as the 16yo Jura, but I think I like this one a bit more."

This one came in a three type gift pack w other Juras , and this one was by far the nicest . Rich body , peat and overall smoothness. Would buy again, on its own"

4.0,"It's good but tastes a bit ""dirty"" like others said it's very full and creamy. But it tastes very earthy, dirt taste. Also it's definitely not as peaty as laphroaig like distiller says. It tastes similar to port charlotte if you put a bit of dirt in it lol. Overall not bad but for the price they're charing you can do better"

3.0,"I am definitely drawn towards a dram of peated whisky. And this is an excellent offering. Though I found this expression by Jura to be a bit one dimensional - I'm glad I gave myself the ""try before you buy"" opportunity, as I could rifle off a few other smoky-phenol flavoured bottles I would prefer. That said, it will remain as a recommendation for others to try. [2016-12-13] [$10 at The Marquis]"

4.25,"One can’t help but be intrigued by the Isle of Jura. The deer outnumber its human population (under 200) by a factor of 25 to 1.  It has one main road, one hotel, and one distillery that shares its name.  The Island also hosts one newly built golf course, Ardfin, which was created by a wealthy Australian hedge fund manager for his own use, and, unfortunately, will not be part of our fall golf trip that covers the Isles of Islay and Arran and the areas of Campbeltown and Glasgow. Jura Prophecy is a good name for this whisky because, frankly, I was totally mystified by this expression. Relatively unimpressed by a bottle of Jura Superstition recently drank, this whisky was a complete surprise. There’s a story behind the moniker, but I will leave that for you to investigate on its box.  The distillery is currently owned by whisky producer, Whyte and Mackay, headquartered in Glasgow. This company was under the umbrella of Diageo plc for a brief period, and was sold off to Emperador Distillors and the Alliance Global Group, Inc. in 2014. Jura is another brand you will find everywhere in the UK, but rarely elsewhere for lack of good marketing and ability to grow. Had Diageo not been forced to spin them off over regulatory concerns of their market dominance, I’m sure this distillery would not have been a well kept secret for long. Despite this, production has still grown to 2.2 million liters per year, and Jura whisky is no longer sold as a filler for other blends. Jura Prophecy has been an annual release that only accounts for about 10,000 bottles of this amount. The packaging for this spirit tells you very little about the whisky itself, and their website makes no mention of this product leading one to wonder about its continuation. Prophecy is comprised of four different whiskies aged for up to 23 years and include Jura Superstition, 10 year old Origin, and 16 year old Diurachs’ Own. The latter of these three spends 14 years in American white oak bourbon and 2 years in Oloroso sherry. Now add final aging in French Limousin oak and you end up with a creation so complex it leaves the experts dumbfounded. In 2010 it received the Beverage Testing Institute’s Platinum Metal award. They described it like, “Drinking buried treasure!” The International Wine and Spirits Competition has awarded it Gold and Silvers for “Best in Class,” and it also received “Best in Show” at the 2010 San Francisco World Spirits Competition. Lastly, it has received multiple Silvers from the International Spirits Challenge. When nosing this whisky for the first time it presented a sophisticated elegance I had not previously experienced. I thought it possibly the result of marrying so many disparate parts, but I also wondered about the influence of French Limousin Oak. These casks are the most expensive in the world, and along with Troncais Oak are the only two woods used to age Cognac. The Limousin oak is culled from the section of a century old tree between the heartwood and sapwood. It is then allowed to age for up to three years to oxidize any remaining bitterness, and the wood is known for its rich vanilla properties. Limousin is also more porous than Troncais and Cognac will extract additional tannins from this variety to produce a stronger and better balanced spirit. This characteristic might also account for Prophecy’s rich copper-brown appearance, since there is no color added, according to Jura’s Visitor Center Manager. Additionally, the spirit is non-chill filtered with a healthy 46% ABV. On the box Prophesy simply states, “Heavily Peated, with fresh cinnamon and spicy sea spray”; however, those in the know find this spirit to be mildly peaty and I agree. Some claim this to be a function of the second tallest stills in Scotland, which limits the ability of volatiles to escape their grasp. A drying Glencairn will produce a plush aroma of sawn hardwoods difficult to match. On the nose I find honeyed vanilla, cinnamon, sherry fruitiness, bourbon spiciness, mild peat reek, earthy peat, citrus, maritime saltiness, and other unrecognizable elements. In addition, expert tasters find over 50 other aromas. The taste is medium oily, smooth and dry with everything going on. Buried treasure is a great description because if you are looking for something in this whisky, it’s there. Peppery effervescence, spices, citrus fruits, honeyed vanilla, almonds, subtle smokiness, toasted malts, sea salt, cinnamon, dried fruits, lemon cake and countless others I could quote from the gurus. The finish is enormously satisfying with very little hint of bitterness. This is a tremendous whisky that I rate at 4.25 stars. Its only flaw is a lack of advertised peatiness. Now that the new record is set at 814 words, I promise to cut down on future reviews. Sorry Generously Paul! :)"

4.0,Rick has summed this whiskey up nicely so I won't rehash. All I'll say is finally I've met a Jura worth a 4 star rating. Beautiful honeyed viscosity and more. It made an impact even after I tasted a fair few other drams prior so it must be a stand out. Good value at $80USD a bottle here in nz.

4.25,"Wow, what a peat. Earthy, herbal notes immediately appear on nose, which develops with spices (cloves, hints of nutmeg). Given time, a maritime character appears, fresher than before. Waiting longer, and seaside mixes with forest. This is Scotland, this is Jura. Otters or deers may appear anytime from my dram.
Mouthfeel is consistent with nose, just adding some bitter oak notes - not the most pleasant I've ever tried, tbh, but not so huge: you can easily  ignore them and keep on sipping. Give some time more into your mouth to this dram, TPC comes and kills oak. it's up to you.
Alcohol is not perceived, anytime. Not a boozy dram at all. 
Give me some fresh oysters, please. Out of stock? Oh, steamed mussels are fine as well, thanks."

4.0,"Nose: Sawdust, with an underpinning dusky hint - sandalwood sawdust. A carpet of autumn leaves. Brine and gymnasium sweat (!) Warm earthy sweet spices (cinnamon, aniseed, cardamom, liquorice) and hops. A little tarry smoke, but not much trace of the ""profound peat"".  A very interesting nose that develops some intriguing oily (almost buttery) vegetal notes as it opens.

Palate: Gorgeous, smooth honeyed arrival and ... ah ha! .. there's the peat, lurking as a foundation that is so well handled you almost miss it until it rises to try and overtake the honey ... but meets its match.  More herbal than fruity - thyme and lemongrass, mustard cress, sage and rocket (aka arugula). Grassy and fresh in perfect balance with the honey, and with an overall oilyness that contributes very good texture and mouthfeel.

Finish: Long and gently lingering, it seamlessly follows the delivery and fades away on sweet and salt vegetal notes, with the honey and peat that have been there throughout the performance echoing into the distance. Lovely.

Sweet honey and fragrant dry herbal components are combined very well here in a most accomplished pairing that waltzes over a ground of perfect peat. To be honest I was not expecting much, having been pretty disappointed by the 10 year expression last year, however this is in a totally different league. Congratulations, Jura distillery, on producing an interesting and individual dram that is also quite delicious.

This is indeed heavily peated, but absolutely not a ""peat monster"". Adding a drop of water highlights the sweet side, but I'd recommend taking it neat - so smooth, you'd never guess for a second that this is 46%.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

Bottled at 46%, with a russetmuscat color.

On the nose: PEAT. BUT THE SWEET, SULPHURIC ONE: 

Chocolate
Peat
Fresh morning Coffee
Burnt rubber
Shoes
Tennis balls. Yep. Amazing.

On the palate: 
Very powerful, chewable oranges, 
Spicy bomb makes you cry in a pleasant rewarding way. Rubber

Finish long  like tasting ¿tennis balls?. It is a Rambo movie in your tongue. Not complex but delicious.

Overall, i give this due to my rating system: 100 over 100!!!
