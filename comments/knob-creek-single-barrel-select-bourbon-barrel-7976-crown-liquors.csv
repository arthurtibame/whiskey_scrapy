3.75,"Review for Crown Liquors Barrel #7976
Warehouse W-W, Floor 2, Rick 50
Barreled on 2/11/2004
Selected on 10/2/2018

N: brown sugar, hints of corn and other grain, soft vanilla
P:  Softly sweet upfront, followed by Deep oak mid-palate with heat
F: shorter with hints of pepper and cocoa, maybe even some tobacco

Inital notes without any added water. You should add water. Nose opens up huge with fruit (cherries and oak), flavors smooth out and some vanilla comes through. Complex spirit, albiet rough around the edges

Stars are for profile after adding water"

4.5,"Knob Creek Single Barrel Select 14yrs 120 proof (store pick)

The color is a rich mahogany...evident of the age. Swirling coats the glass with thick legs running down
Nose: immediate is a massive hit of rich vanilla and maple syrup, oak boards at a lumber mill. My mind immediately goes to thinking “Stagg Jr-esque.” Neck pour, so I’m going to let it sit & breathe for 20 mins and come back. Ok, back at it. Cedar shavings & toasted oak notes dominate now. Layers of a sweet dusty corn, rich caramel, and buttered brown sugar float around under the oak notes. 
Palate: Rich, oily, sweet, hot and spicy, and a big Kentucky hug after the swallow. This is a big bourbon and it lets you know right away. Caramel, toasted marshmallow, brown sugar and butter flambéed over vanilla bean ice cream, mint, cedar, cinnamon red hots, all spice, sweet corn, grape sweet tarts.
Finish: drying, cracked black peppercorns, leather, vanilla cream and mint, and boiled peanuts. The finish fades but the oak presence lingers on. 
In summation, this is a gorgeous big ass bourbon...esp for the price. A nice substitute for Stagg Jr if you can’t find it and at a better price point to boot. This possibly just shot up to my top 5 bourbon list. Will have to do a side by side with Stagg Jr and see if it supplants the mighty Stagg. I think it can go toe to toe. If you love big rich flavors and oak presence this is a whiskey for you."
5.0,"Got this at total wine, amazing bourbon for the price.  Rich flavors of caramel, oak and leather.  With ice you get some of they Jim beam peanut funk that I love.  I would rate this higher than many $100+ bottles.  Amazing value."

4.75,"6 Degree Urban Kitchen 14 yr barrel pick from Scottsdale Arizona purchased at Fry’s in Chandler, AZ. 

Really inviting nose of caramel, wood grain, and barrel spice. Big cherry bomb and aggressive oak in the palate with typical Beam peanut funk and cinnamon on the finish. 120 proof but no ethanol in the nose or palate. Miles above the standard SiB. It’s easy to taste the effect of the extra years on this one. Top notch juice."
4.25,"Taste:  Neat in glen cairn, 2 oz. pour.  Binny's Pick, 120 proof barreled on 10/14/04, bottled on 9/4/18.  Warehouse W-L floor 5.

Nose: (4.0)  Deep nose with ethanol let's you know this bourbon isn't playing.  Once it dissipates some I get apple pie crust, caramel, french vanilla.  The nose is much like some of the Booker's I have had, and I love those.  Bluegrass immediately came to mind.

Taste (4.5):  It is rich with a creamy texture.  This is on the sweeter side but has sime punch.  I describe it as a boozy apple pie ala mode drizzled with caramel, then sprinkled with the familiar Beam peanutty flavor.

Finish (4.25)  I am digging it, but want more of it.  Deep oak, smoke, butterscotch.  Only complaint is that it is gone to quick.

Overall:  This is an example of Jim Beam product at its finest.  It proves that to be really good it doesnt need to be really expensive.  At 39.99 I would drink this over most bourbons 3x the cost."
4.5,"So this is a very cool bottle of knob creek.  14 year aged barrel from sprayberry bottle shop.   Barrel 8013 warehouse L floor 5 rack 21 tier 1.   Barreled on 10/14/04 and selected on 10/18/18.   120 proof.  Excellent  smells of oak, vanilla and caramel.   At 120 proof this needs ice to mellow.  This bourbon has a great body and you feel like you want to chew it syrupy thick bodies caramel goodness.   A slight pepper finish on the exhale with just a slight burn.  This is a very vey good bourbon.  Wish it was not one per person!"

4.0,As the bottle opens up I am upping my score to 4.0. I'm enjoying this one.!
4.0,"Smell reminds me of a musty hotel room, but not in a bad way. Suck past the tongue for a red licorice taste."
4.0,"A sample from dthom as part of the ""whiskey transfer program"".  This is a 120 proof 14 year barrel pick.  I usually like Jim Beam products in general and Knob Creek specifically so I'm looking forward to this.

Nose: Very sweet vanilla with dark caramelized sugars and toasted nuts, and a background grassy herbal note.  The more I get in to the nose the more I get the usual nutty Jim Beam feel that I enjoy.  

Flavor: More vanilla and dark sugars, heavy toasted nuts, some baking spice, red fruits especially cherry.  A little buttery which I enjoy.  A little like caramelized pecans or peanut brittle.

Finish: Medium long with more toasted nuts, barrel char, some rye spice, baking spices, fading in to a drying nutty barrel flavor that I enjoy.

Hits all the high points I expect from a Jim Beam product and at quite a solid price point.  High value and very tasty."

3.0,"Very strong alcohol nose with some spice. 

Lots of bite, not sweet. 

Never found the chocolate and banana notes I read I should get, but that’s prolly me. 

Put the last 8oz of the bottle into some Xmas Day sours and the 60% abv stood up to the sweet and tart of my sour mix very well."

4.5,"14 year and 8 month old pick from Discount Liquor in Nashville, TN 

Nice dark color. Noticeably darker than another KC SiB I have (9yr).

Nose has caramel, cinnamon and other baking spices, oak, brown sugar, red apple, and leather.

Palate is rich and slightly oily with plenty of oak and baking spices. Nice old leather makes a nice appearance as well as a little rye and corn. I also get some of that Jim Beam nutty character, along with some cherries.
It does dry the palate a little bit, but that’s common for the proof.

Finish is long with lingering oakiness and a slow burn down your chest.

This is fantastic! I would put this up against many other quality barrel proofs like it’s brother Bookers as well as Stagg Jr, Elijah Craig Barrel Proof. At this price point ($45) it is unbeatable!"

5.0,"This was a single barrel store pick by Orange County NC, and is the best bourbon I've had so far. The standard Single Barrel Select is 9 years, this barrel was 15 years and 1 month old.

I wasn't the biggest fan of Knob Creek Small Batch, this is miles better by comparison and only $13 more. I think the age completely mellows out the harsh nose and taste I got from the Small Batch. This is incredibly drinkable for 120 proof. Huge brown sugar and oak notes on the nose. Maybe some berries and caramel, but it's a brown sugar/oak bomb and you need a good nose to pick out the rest. It is sweet and delicious on the tongue. Not sickly sweet, the dessert spice and oak  balances the brown sugar/caramel sweetness to perfection. I also taste more stewed dark fruits than what I smelled. Oak and alcohol are most prominent on the finish. It lingers for a long time and turns to toffee, spice, and a little tobacco or vegetal.

I saw a review on WhiskeyJug describing one of his KC SiB Select bottles as creme brulee, and I think that describes this well. It's a classic example of what I think bourbon should taste like. As a high proof/cask strength bourbon (>55%), I like it more than these I've had in the last year: Elijah Craig, Old Grand Dad, Maker's Mark, Wild Turkey, Russell's Reserve, 1792, and Old Forester. At $50 it's hard to think of a better buy when you consider how many unique single barrels you can try.

4.5,"(Primarily for my own records. Probably a useless review outside of the Phoenix AZ area)

Barrel #6658 “Selected by Will Simpson for Sonata’s restaurant”.  Confirmed with KC that was barreled in 2004, making this a 14 yr old pick. Review will focus on the differences between this pick and the standard “single barrel” release. 

Age difference immediately noticeable with BIG barrel char notes not as prevalent in the standard. More oak forward as well. Spicy finish but not as prickly as the norm, with the extra age taking off any lingering rough edges. Standard KC peanut and cherry flavors still dominate, but larger caramel presence as well. Finish is super long ending in peanut shell, cinnamon, and a hint of peppermint. 

Overall, a stunner. Too bad I am unlikely to ever find it again but if I did it would be an automatic buy at the $53 I paid."

5.0,"I've had select 16 year, 15 year, and 14 year. All 3 of them were absolutely amazing.

Not only were the notes of spice unique to each bottle, all in their own right, yet at the same time sharing the common ground that you expect to find in Knob Creek. 

I will always buy any single barrel select I find due the consistent high quality, high content bourbon that maintains nice, invigorating notes of spice while delivering on a clean and smooth heat as an after affect."

3.75,"Nose: Love the nose on this one; baked goods with carmel and a hit of vanilla, with some oakiness. 

Taste: First sip was quite spicy (expected at this proof) but had a great  buttery, Carmel flavor with a slow burn. The second sip opened up with some toasted nutty flavor, more Carmel, vanilla, and a bit of banana? Am I getting that right? Crazy. 

Value: At $40-ish this is a monster value. I can see this neat, opened up with some water or ice, and killer with Old Fashioneds or Whisky Sour."
3.5,"It’s a little hot on the nose. The palate is really good. This one is a 15 year single barrel from Elixir Spirits in Cool Springs, TN. I get brown sugar and vanilla before it finishes with a spiced cherry and drying oak note. I enjoy it but I think the small batch versions are a more rounded product and better experience."

Palette is a thick, but dry oak bomb followed by some fruity sweetness and a touch of vanilla. Finish is longggg and oaky. Love these picks and this is the best I’ve had yet."

Wow!  Very impressed. I thought with Kroger being so large they would not hit anything sensational. This is!  
Sweet Carmel nose. Solid bold spicy flavor.   Hot finish.  
I’m not a descriptive reviewer so just trust me and try it.  $40, incredible value."
