Lots of fruits to nose through: raisins, apples, dark fruits and citrus. A little water brings out a brighter side, banana and vanilla.

The taste is pleasant, dark fruit and spices. Cinnamon and vanilla in traces, with a hint of grassyness. Again, a little water really opens it up.

This is very enjoyable for a relatively inexpensive single malt. This would be a great accessible scotch for a home bar."

null,"Nose: Vanilla, light sugar, and a ton of barrel funk.  Way more funk than I'd expect, more than I'd think would come from a sherry finished single malt.  Weird.  Very fruity as well.  Ripe pear, ripe banana, and clove as well.

Flavor: Very sweet and mild.  A little smoky which I didn't expect and, frankly, didn't appreciate.  A little dull and watery.

Finish:  Kind of skunky to be honest.  Super gross finish.

This was a sample bottle as part of a three pack of Glenlivet samples and I think this must be a bad bottle.  Absolutely terrible taste and finish.  I'm not going to give this review a number as this can't be how it normally tastes."

Nose: Malt and pear, oak and walnut. Maybe a tad floral? Smells strong and very good.

Palate: Surprisingly tasty given the abv. Malt and wood. Sweetness is lower than expected.

Finish: Short. A bit of oak and then nothing.

Try it with a few drops of water (again, surprisingly).

2.0,"This tasting belongs in my palate-building series so without much ado here we go:
Nose: Medicinal alcohol. Floral. Citrus. Muted smoke
Palate: Enters with a dash of everyday “standard malt” showcasing orange peel / orange zest. Rolls over smooth...probably due to the low a$$ abv. I can tell it’s a young juice. Uncomplicated (aka not complex). In a blind taste I would have guessed bottom shelf,  entry level scotch whiskey. Would probably be great for a mixer. 
Finish: Short - medium. Some sprinkle of tingly spice at the end like toasted peppercorns. Doesn’t leave a whole lot to be desired but neither does it have whole to lot to complain about. May be described as a “do no harm” whiskey.

WrapUp: Bought for a great price (sub $30) @ Costco as part of my palate-training batch. If one was looking to dabble in scotch whiskey with an established Speysider, this would be a no-brainer for the price-2-value. Hits all the usual Spey malt notes with no drama for your mama. Would not be seeking another bottle or asking for another taste once bottle is gone. Debating whether the last ounce will end up in my infinity bottle like the rest of my killed bottles. Can’t say it made a strong case. Upon this Speysider I say, 2⭐️"

On the tongue the scotch has a buttery feel with faint notes of vanilla and cask wood.  As it evolves into the finish, the whisky develops a briny quality to it.  Orange peel comes out very late in the finish.

A good scotch that is smooth without being too subtle. Best enjoyed with a few drops of water to open up the drink."

1.75,"Nose: Sweet apple cider, pear juice, baked banana, fruit-flavoured bubblegum. Some light floral marshmallow-like notes but this is overwhelmingly a sweet fruity nose. Over time it tends to become more like cider vinegar.

Palate: The arrival is light and slightly sweet with some fruity notes but a good deal of hard, gritty tannin. This gives way to more distinct apple flavours and pear in the development together with warmer spice notes. Apple and cinnamon muffins! It is crisp, but leaning towards harshness, and there is a cardboard note. It tastes like the cut was feinty and the texture is austere.

Finish: Medium/short. Sweet but tannic and veering toward metallic. Cold overbrewed tea and a bitter/sour ale-like note in the aftertaste.

This is young malt whisky intended for mixing. I think it is being blended from a younger selection of barrels now than when the expression was first released five years ago, and those barrels are from tired stock. I last had a bottle of this in 2016. It made a more positive impression then and my old tasting notes are similar to the majority of those on this site.

There is less of the touted vanilla presence, particularly for bourbon casks, and I didn’t find it to be creamy in texture - sweet, yes, but more like apple juice. Adding water improves it by glossing over the faults but it’s fragile and a drop too much makes it fall apart.

The best thing to do with this is mix it with cola, dry ginger or lemonade. The hard cereal and spice notes help it to cut through sugary soft drinks in the same manner as blended scotches that have a hard finish, and the result is a pleasantly balanced fruity/whisky flavour.

I’ve recently mentioned it in other reviews here as a representative good starter malt, but that was based on memory and old notes. Having re-tasted it I’ll have to amend those reviews.

Neat or with water: “Inferior” : 1.25 stars, but as a mixer: ""Acceptable"" : 2.25 stars
Splitting the difference as ""Adequate"" : 1.75 stars

I'm rating this harshly because it is comparatively expensive for the quality. The normal retail price here is $72 and for that money there are a lot of much better malts. Glen Moray Classic Elgin or Crabbie's Yardhead are both considerably cheaper but knock this out in the first round."
4.25,Excellent scotch for the price. In my experience so far it cannot be beaten for price to quality ratio. Very smooth and sweet just as a Glenlivet should be. I could drink this every day all day long.

4.0,"This is definitively the best Glenlivet i have had, (this is my third, after 12 yo and 15yo french oak) and it has great flavor but as any other Glenlivet, the aroma is a little dim, losing points in my score.

Bottled at 40%abv, burnished color.

On the nose is nice, but very dim. It is hard to nose this Glenlivet because the aroma is almost ""ghostly"". Ginger, Wine grapes, tobacco, apple Juice and honey are the notes i got.

On the palate is very pleasant, very smooth, very balanced. Honey, toffee, new wood, ginger and dried tobacco leaf are the main notes i found. Medium bodied, but with a long lovely spicy finish. 

Overall is a good whisky,  i believe people who want a normal/sweet dram every now and then can enjoy it. 80/100"
