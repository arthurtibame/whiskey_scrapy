3.0,"First and foremost, this is nutty and medicinal, with a pretty strong overlay of seaweed, toffee, and...is that...fish oil? The aftertaste has that kind of numbing, witch hazel hum that will remind you of your earliest experience with cheap brown liquor. Listen, I prefer single malts that have an attitude, that make a statement, that shriek ""I am here, dammit!"", and this spirit does that. Do I wish there was more peat, maybe more cherry or vanilla (as opposed to that toffee/nougat thing!) and less of the rubbing alcohol-like numbing anti-taste? Why, yes I do. Yet the Laphroaig 10 says, I AM IN YOUR MOUTH, PAY ATTENTION, and I like that. And this is probably why I rate this as high as I do."

4.0,"I am a new taster so take my notes with a grain of salt. I tasted sea salt immediately, followed by heavy peat smoke. This is a drink I will not forget but it is a flavor that is very specific. Do not plan on drinking anything after this. I had the flavor on my palette for the rest of the night."
4.5,"The heavy fusel burn dovetails perfectly with the peat smoke. All the usual descriptors: smoked meat, campfire, tobacco ash, cigars. It's all cliche but it's because it's all true.

It does benefit from a droplet, only because the moss and soil then overshadows the alcohol heat. It's the most boggy whiskey that I've had with the possible exception of Ardbeg 10."

4.0,"(Edit: I am tasting the 43%) Initial peat is very present. Definitely one of the more peaty whiskeys. The peat consists of bandaid rubber, medicinal notes, and meat that has been charred black. Also has a brine of seawater, reminds me of washed up kelp almost. Behind that there is a classic malty sweetness. The back end sweetness is actually very floral and pretty"

Just wish the smoke was a little lighter so the rest was easier to find.  But it’s there if you look close enough.  Takes you to a cold windy beach.  

Smokey, ash, salt water, grass tasting notes, campfire nose."

I have a tough time drinking something that tastes like medicines, before they figured out how to flavor them, not that flavored meds are much better, unless it’s kids medicine LOL. I’ll pass on the band aid flavored scotches thank you :-)."

Going back to straight laphroiag, I was then able to pick up some sweeter notes, followed by some sour/tartness. Surprisingly no heat-definitely would try again when I’m in the mood for something smokey."

4.5,"Laphroaig 10. I've reviewed so many bottlings from this distillery, and somehow am just getting around to reviewing its staple product. The first peated whisky I had ever owned. Or tasted for that matter. And I absolutely hated it. I actually thought it was expired. Slowly, it grew on me. And the rest...

Nose: Classic Laphroaig notes. Seaweed, sea salt, brine, iodine, and band-aid. Peat and campfire smoke. Black pepper and oak. Ash and charcoal, grapefruit and lemon citrus. Smoked meats, rib, and brisket. A bit of custard and vanilla sweetness, maybe even mint chocolate. Some of the classic Laphroaig chestnut note, though it disappears after about 10 minutes. But brine, smoke, peat, meat, oak, medicinal notes, and citrus dominate here. Very complex for 43% ABV.

Palate: Campfire smoke, ash, charcoal, and peat take the forefront. Brine, salt, seaweed, iodine, and band-aid remain. Surprisingly, I'm getting strong fruit notes: the lemon is still there, but takes a back seat to apple, pear, peach, and apricot. Still getting the meat notes, as well as the vanilla. Some dark chocolate appears with time in the glass. The custard is gone, and it's a bit thinner than the nose let on. Still getting oak and black pepper, now with cinnamon. Very good.

Finish: Medium-long. Heaps of charcoal, ash, smoke, and sea salt. Dark chocolate carries over, even stronger than on the palate. Then it's black pepper, cinnamon, and oak. The spice also presents as a red-pepper e chili here. Impressive finish, especially considering the proof.

And there it is. The fact that I now enjoy this stuff, which I once considered undrinkable, is a landmark in my whisky journey. I've enjoyed this for years at this point, but this is the first time I've put those thoughts to pen and paper, if you will.

This is one of my defaults at bars. It's very common, which means I've almost always got a top-notch pour available. This is one of the great flagship products in all of the whisky world. Worth the time of experienced peat heads and beginners alike. And it's easily one of the best VFM purchases one could make. Nothing but good things to say about this one. If you haven't tried it yet, and can handle a bit of peat, make buying this one a priority."

To me, the Laphroaig 10 is like the inverse of the Lagavulin 16: the Lagavulin is heavy up front with peat but then dials it back in favor of other flavors, where the Laphroaig holds the peat back and then suddenly smacks you in the mouth with it.  It’s not overwhelming, though.  Saltwater, mint, generic melon, and new tires turn up in the mouth, too.  The lingering burn makes it seem like higher than 43% ABV, and in the best possible way.  It’s full, oily, and multidimensional, with a long weedy finish.  Hard to ask for anything more at this price."

After that exciting event, i got to say that Laphroaig 10 year old is a heavily peated, very ""islay"" dram. As a fact i have tasted (and loved) the Johnnie Walker Island Green, and now i know what does it have inside: its laphroaig.

On the nose, once the bottle is opened, if you smell it, you will percieve a freshly opened can of tennis balls. On the glass it is a typical Islay single malt: very peated, prunes and bonfire. Lovely.

On the palate is medium-long bodied with a very straightforward note of burnt rubber or burnt meat, that instantly changes into a hot (mild) and spicy (pleasant) note.  Finish is medium, with hints of mint and spices. 

The whole experience is awesome, you should try this at least once just to teach yourself and others that not every whisky is alike. If you pick any highland whisky, this is the complete opposite. Beautiful, drink it on a beach day"

Once you taste it, that numbing tingly feel takes effect but it also sends a warm shot through your body.  Overall it’s different from anything I’ve ever tasted but I’m definitely a fan.  Warning: it could be an acquired taste for some."

4.5,"I’m just getting into whisky and don’t know how to find all the notes that I hear others finding so take this for what it’s worth; an amateur’s opinion.

The nose for me is all smoke, with a permanent marker type of vibe mixed with cough syrup, but I a good way (if that makes any sense).

The taste up front is heavy smoke that rolls into a woody/earthy tone midway. The finish is a faint sweetness (somewhere along the lines of caramel)

So far Laphroiag 10 and Ardbeg 10 are the only whiskies I can truly say I enjoy neat."

4.0,"Nose: initial delicious briny nose that leads to a full and floral body. The peat that makes it so enticing floats around that whole aroma. The more it airs out the more I get if a bitterness akin to dark chocolate without the sweetness to follow. 

Taste: Beautiful, full mouth feel that coats my tongue. It starts out very light, most likely the alcohol vapors filling my mouth up then moves to something smoky. Also the quickest most delightful heat right before it just hangs out on the tongue.  Flavors for me included something herbal yet savory, maybe like a cinnamon without the spice. Couldn’t quite place it. 

Overall: 4 stars. Love Islay scotch and Laphroaig is one of my favorites after the Quarter Cask. Would definitely recommend, but not for the tame."

Then the power of the sea is in the background but keep on the nose and I find creamy toffee notes and salted caramel. A real dirty peat which Laphroaig is famed for, unlike some other sweet peats that can come from Islay. 
If I’m having a couple of drams, I sometimes like to start with the laphraoig 10 before going for something sweet afterwards. It completely opens your inner sense of smell and taste. 
Delightful! 🥃"

Palate: Sweeter than the nose with some hints of vanilla and cane sugar. Saltiness and smokiness blending together. Some very light malty notes as well.

Finish: Long and smokey. Very gentle and subtlety salty. Feels like the end of a nice beach day. 

Overall Thoughts: This is one of my absolute favorite Scotch whiskies in the world. It’s one I’ve gifted for very special occasions and one I always recommend to newbies and one I love to enjoy with my whisky-drinking friends. Laphroaig truly is a rich and special whisky."
3.75,"Was my first peated Islay whiskey so for me the peat was overpowering but pleasent. Im told if you’ve been around the block a few times this malt falls into to the lighter-brighter category of peaty malts. 
So, the nose is strong on peat, iodine-saltiness, seaweed and some kind of fresh medicinal smell. It smell like as if you have just put out a campfire made on the beach with seawater that had seaweed in it.

The taste is very similiar to the nose, however it is suprisingly sweet. That medicinal sweetness is much brighter than you would think from the nose.
I cant quite recognize what kind of sweetness that is, maybe some lemony-sugary.

On the finish, the salty seaweed and peat stays for a very long time. I have felt them in my mouth after half on our of drinking the last sip, even after having 3 scoops of ice cream.
Very nice introduction to strong Islay flavors. I liked it, however i would not have it as a daily drinker just yet."
