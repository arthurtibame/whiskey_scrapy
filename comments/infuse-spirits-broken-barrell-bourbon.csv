3.5,I like it on those nights when I wanna “drink cheap”... it’s a decent pour.
4.0,"Smooth vanilla and fig up front.  Baking spice.  Rich and gentle finish, especially considering the high proof."
3.25,"The barrel is prevalent.  Or in this case the staves.  The base whiskey is muddy with no identity but whatever infusion method they use, while they admit it’s sac religiously obtained, the result is pretty flavorful."

3.0,"Rec from the bartender when I asked for something spicy. Very hot, a bit of spice, lots of grain."

2.75,"Hit a local dive bar to grab a quick bite and watch my Eagles sneak into the playoffs! Now when I say dive bar, they consider Maker's to be their top shelf. So I was happy to see a new addition to their line up. I knew nothing about this one but was in a gambling mood! After the first sip was pleasant enough, I decided to research it. 
This is a sourced Bourbon from Kentucky (O.Z. Taylor Distillery) that is finished for an unspecified amount of time with American and French oak staves. It's then finally finished in ex-Sherry casks. It's 95% proof and is an NAS Bourbon. Their is no straight designation either. They do call it small batch but honestly that really means nothing without true context.
Now how does it taste? It's actually quite pleasant. Yeah get big red fruit notes upon entry with a slight spice swell leading into a medium oak and spice driven finish. Goes down pretty smooth for the proof. I actually had 2 pours watching the game and was happy with them. It's got not much complexity, and being that it's from Kentucky with no 'straight' designation, you can bet a good % of the juice is under 2 yrs old (according to their website it can be as young as 6 months old prior to the additional finishing). And you can taste the youth. No real Bourbon flavors you would expect come through. It's all from the cask finishing, with the spice the only thing the Bourbon contributes. Now by no means am I trashing this pour. Like I said I enjoyed it. If anything, Infuse Spirits should be commended for being able to create something from what I am sure is poor source material. At $29 a bottle, if you like Sherry finished Whiskey, it's not a bad deal. It's a Frankenstein of a Whiskey for sure, but one that somehow pulls it off without offending the drinker.
Cheers all!"
4.0,May 2019. Maybe at Durks or some bar around grdauation time. Smooth. Syrupy. No bite? Oak?
5.0,"fantastic bourbon with a after taste of scotch, sherry oak cask... splendid!"
2.0,"Very tannic, lots of oak and spice. Opens up with water but the wood masks any complexity."
1.0,Extremely oaky on the nose. Just overwhelming oak

3.75,Oaky and wood taste. Tasting the double barrel finishing. Not much depth
3.5,"Very fruity nose, maple forward with hints of cedar and an oak finish. It’s a pretty hot bourbon that is sweet with strong caramel and light vanilla taste. Hints of raisins and molasses"
3.75,"Tasting neat.  The appearance is a deep amber. Nose is cocoa, oak, caramel, and vanilla.  The nose doesn't deceive, as the taste is rich with chocolate, sherry, vanilla, and butterscotch.  Cocoa and butterscotch last through the medium long finish. The heat is subdued and is quite smooth

Very unique and a case study for what you can do with finishing.  I don't know how good the base whiskey was, but nothing offensive came out.  Whether it was a decent base, or if any youth and faults were masked by the finishing is unknown.  Regardless, worth a try to see what french oak and sherry casks can do to a bourbon"
