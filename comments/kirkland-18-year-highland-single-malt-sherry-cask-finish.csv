4.25,"Very nice sherried whisky. Very little burn, and has lots of complex flavor. No water needed, beautiful as is. Could accidentally drink the whole bottle before you know it. Definitely worth the price- it’s a great value."
3.75,"Taste of oak/vanilla, fruits (apricot) and a smooth finish that lingers for a few minutes. It’s really good and a best bang for buck 18 year old speyside scotch. Is it Macallan? Could be a few barrels that they ended up selling to Alexander Murray but doesn’t taste exactly like Macallan. If you find a bottle at your local Costco, definitely worth giving it a try."
4.5,"aroma: Butter, honey, pears, vanilla, hints of peat and oak
flavor: spicey upfront, mild peat and pears, finishes with honey and oak
overall: incredible for the price and just a really good smooth scotch"
