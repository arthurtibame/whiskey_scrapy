5.0,"a balance of tastes. wish I could get more out of the smoke, but very good overall. 100% would try again, if I could find it"
4.25,"I have no idea how this bottle found its way to me. It was distilled in 2003, and is a 5 year old whisky; so bottled in ‘08 or ‘09. I found this bottle when my local liquor store was renovating in 2017. That’s almost a full decade from when I expect it would have hit the shelves. It’s like it blew into my life in a DeLorean and told me to hop in. 

This is one of the most unique whiskies I have ever experienced. Seeing 5 years old on the tin brings images to your mind of a rough and unrefined malt, but this was the exact opposite of that. This is hands down the most luxurious tasting whisky I have had. Everything about it was velvet and plush. 

The nose is all cream, vanilla, malt, chocolate milkshake with whipped cream on top. 

The palate was, this is so cliche, smooth. It was so creamy smooth. It had a mouthfeel like I’ve never experienced. It felt more like a cream liqueur in the mouth than a whisky. The flavours were exactly what the nose promised. Rich, creamy dessert. Vanilla custard, whipped cream, brown sugar, and so much malt. 

The finish was medium at best. The rich creaminess dried to vanilla and some nutmeg. 

Again, this was such a unique and enjoyable whisky. It is nothing like any other expression I have had from Bruichladdich. I bought an ‘09 organic thinking it might share some characteristics with the ‘03; not even close. The ‘09 is clearly related to the Classic Laddie. The ‘03 is nothing like the Classic. If you have a DeLorean, fire up the flux capacitor and go pick one of these up for the love of god!"
