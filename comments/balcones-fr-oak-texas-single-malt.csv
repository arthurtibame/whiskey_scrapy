But this thing is pretty complex. Medium-longish finish."

4.0,"Nose: Deep and intense nose. Burned butter, cognac, plum pudding, baked fig and orange tart, dark almost-burnt Christmas cake. There's a note that isn't smoke but it's reminiscent of something scorched - it's vaguely like a wood-fired cooking stove. Lots of warm (but not hot) spices. With water the nose opens and shows some vanilla but most prominently it showcases the quality of the casks with an aroma of fresh, crisp well-managed barrel.

Palate: A no-holds-barred arrival of strong alcohol, hefty baking spices, dark fruitcake, espresso, very dark chocolate and very strong oak tannins. Again there's that phantom almost-but-not-quite smoky presence and a hefty treacle flavour. The texture is medium. With water this whisky really shows its complexity and depth. It gains sweetness, more spice, considerably more fruitiness (of a less baked quality) and changes character in a very pleasant manner.

Finish: Medium/long. Baking spices, dark chocolate and prickly baked fruit that slowly subside into a mildly oaky aftertaste. There's a little puff of aromatic smoky spice right at the end. Adding water intensifies the bitter chocolate note in the finish, considerably lengthens it, and a cereal sweetness appears.

This is a big, bold and assertive whisky that is also quite stylish and certainly not a simple bludgeon to the senses. The relatively high proof is not overpowering and has surprisingly little burn. It's mellow but not soft or simple. This is more a cutlass than a club, more a cutting wit than a crude tirade.

Being much more used to Scottish malt whisky the profile is a little unusual to my palate, but there are similarities. The nose in particular reminds me of very high proof sherried whisky but it has a distinctive nature. That elusive smoke thing is quite individual but at its heart the nose has the dryness of malt rather than the sweetness of corn. Like all really good noses, it keeps evolving and opening in the glass.

The palate is demonstrative and has some of the characteristics of rye whisky but really it is its own thing - Texas malt. I think this is relatively young (2-3 years?) and you taste that youth, but you also sense a greater maturity than would be expected. This is a kid who grew up quick. Adding water uncovers malty notes in the palate and personally I preferred it diluted (but then I always taste high-proof whisky both neat and watered).

I really enjoyed this whisky and slowly nosed and sipped it for about an hour while watching a film. I don't think there was any Australian allocation for this particular expression but other Balcones whiskies are available here for around AUS$110-140 which is quite reasonable. I must obtain more of their offerings.

My thanks to @Soba45 who shared a tasting dram received from @PBMichiganWolverine. Much appreciated, good sirs.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

4.25,Tase like a more intense version of there standard single malt. I like it!
4.5,"Damn. It’s loud for sure, but the noise doesn’t drown out the bevy of flavor. Chocolate, coffee, oak, and plum are heavy. An absolute assault of flavor. This thing lingers and I love it."

4.0,Sweet on the nose smells like raisins. Lot of heat with the high proof. Sweet and rich with baking spices and brown butter. Long finish with a touch of charcoal.
4.0,"A man's 6 year old daughter played truth or dare with his wife before xmas.  The woman foolishly chose truth.""Is it Santa or you and daddy who brings us presents?"" asked the girl. As the man knew to well the woman was cunning and answered ""We buy some of them"" which was true as her aunties bought the rest. The child was not done however...like her mother she waited until the man was at his most vulnerable....hung over and running late to pick up his wife. ""Truth or dare"" a small voice piped up from the back seat of the car. The man had his hands full literally with a steering wheel so Truth was his only option. 'How hard can it be he thought?' She's only a fraction of the age of her mother..""I've seen a lot of fake Santas so far..is he actually real?"" The man did what he often did when hung over or drunk or pretty much anytime he thought he was smarter than he was and spoke his mind... which ladies and gentlemen is NEVER a good thing in married life. ""Well think about it darling how likely do you think it is that magic reindeer fly round the world to 3 billion kids to give them presents and a fat man who is 300 years old squeezes down chimneys in an age of heat pumps and eats approximately 4 billion cookies and drinks 2 billion litres of milk in one night?"". Instantly as soon as the words were out of his mouth the man knew he was in deep deep trouble from mumma bear as junior bear who deeply believed in santa more than the man believed whiskey would solve all his problems was also in the car. Desperately he said ""Let's talk about this later darling and hey you can all have as much icecream as you want... think about the flavors you want"". Picking up his wife and driving home in record time whilst praying no mention of santa or a game of truth or dare would occur he cracked open a present from santa aka @PBMichiganWolverine and wrote #5 in the Santa Chronicles. Man this is a nice dram. Initially young and harsh once your tongue gets used to the flavour the combination of French oak and bourbony flavors marries well. Thanks PBM!"

4.0,"Fruitcake, Texas style.  

The French oak comes out clearly in this.  French oak is tighter grained and less dense than American oak, so it imparts  more subtle flavors and firmer, but silkier texture.  It also gives it a bit of chocolate-y roasted quality, making it almost more elegant.   Its American counterpart gives a more sweeter flavor, namely vanilla.  But French oak is more expensive than American...just harder to work with, but not as difficult as the Japanese oak mizunara.  

This here clearly takes that French oak to heart.  You get the Texas burnt charcoal, but comes out smoother and a bit less brash.  At just about 2 years, personally I felt it could’ve benefited with more aging...but that Texas heat would’ve probably overdone the wood interaction anyway.  

Out of three Balcones I’ve had ( single malt 1, and Brimstone), this was far better.  But...personally, my favorite American craft still remains as Del Bac’s Dorado...this maybe in the top 5 American craft, for me at least."
