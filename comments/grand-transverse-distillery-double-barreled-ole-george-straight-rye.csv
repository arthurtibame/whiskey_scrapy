3.5,"Much spicier on the nose than the original. Spicy, graham cracker, herbal bright pepper. The french oak is great but a bit much. Charred sugar notes."

3.0,The first taste is hot and lingering. A strong nose makes my eyes water if I keep my nose in the glass too long. I liked it better when I was on vacation in Traverse City. The distillery was well worth the visit. I spent a couple hours talking to the distiller and tasting everything he threw at me.
null,tried at the Grand Traverse  Frankenmuth tasting room

2.75,Better than the bourbon from Grand Traverse Distillery. Fairly smooth. Can not justify paying $50/750 ml for this one.
1.0,Their standard whiskey is better!
