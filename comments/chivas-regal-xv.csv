4.25,"Nose: rich and sweet concentrated notes of stewed apples homemade orange Marmelade,honey, cinnamon and moist juicy sultans.
Taste: smooth and fruity flavors of poached pears intermingled with butterscotch and caramel toffees all rolled up is a wonderful velvety texture. 
Finish: Rounded off with a touch of vanilla on the  finish."

4.0,"This is a fine new release by Chivas, matured exclusively in Grande Champagne Cognac Casks. The only 15yo blend that Chivas has right now. 

Bottled at 40%abv.

On the nose, its very appealing: Tobacco, Green grapes, Burnt oak, freshly cut green apples, Dry grass, Maple syurp and Pear. 

On the palate: Red apples, Cinammon, Ginger, Burnt oak. Aftertaste is herbal spicy, long.

Overall this is a fine dram, an easy everyday whisky. 80/100."
