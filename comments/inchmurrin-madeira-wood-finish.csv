3.25,A bit smoky and spicy. Sweet and citrus smell but not in the taste. Oily and salty finish with latter notes of hazelnut
2.75,"At nose very delicate spicy flavour. At taste still punchy spicy taste, burning and warm, a bit tart with long bitter sour finish"

3.0,"Eh, not my favorite from Inchmurrin/Loch Lomond. The nose, for me, fell flat. The LL/Inchmurrin malt has a funk to it, and that's OK, but all I really got on the nose was that cheap tequila/wet cat vibe. Really did not prime me to like this. The mouth is significantly improved, with the kinds of things one would expect from a double maturation in a fortified wine cask - dried fruit, almond and marzipan, plus a bit of vanilla. But...that was about it. Nowhere near as interesting or engaging as the other Inchmurrins I've had."
4.0,"Very fruity, full, sweet, oily, almost like port wine. Perfect for seeking balance with very smoky whisky."

3.25,"Nosing: sweet blackcurrent with a mild mild sting of pepper. 2.75

Flavour: how do I describe this - lightning zest all around. Incredibly smooth and flavourful. Fruity zest with citrus playfulness and a mature oakiness is the main star. Very full flavour hitting every note on your palate. Grapes at the finish 4 

Finish: fruits and raisins - no smoke but very pleasant 3"
4.0,"Red fruit on the nose, full and sweet. Taste is full and rich, with red fruit and the madeira finish really shows. This whisky really benefits from a few drops of water"
4.25,Excellent. Smooth and nutty. Soft finish.
