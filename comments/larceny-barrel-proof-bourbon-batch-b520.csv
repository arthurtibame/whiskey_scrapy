3.25,"LARCENY BP B520

*NOSE: Pours into the Glencairn a nice dark mahogany color. Maple. Caramel Praline Peanuts. Dusty Oak. Dry Toast. Hay. Just a Hint of Orange Peel. A little bit of Stinging Heat.
*NEAT: I find that standard Larceny drinks hotter than its proof. I wouldn't go so far as to say this drinks hotter than its proof, but it drinks every point of its 122.2. Thick and Clingy Mouthfeel. I get that ""Larceny Vegetal Sweet Potato Note"" I always get. Brown Sugar. Cinnamon. Dry Roast Peanuts. Much too Astringent Oak. A rather long finish with a nice KY Hug. An Iced Tea Sweetness coats the palate along with some Bitter Tannins. 
*SPLASH: Brings the Vegetal Note to the nose and amps up the Peanut on the palate. I do think this will do well with a large cube of ice or paired with some Angustoras for an Old Fashioned.

*VERDICT: This has some faults (overly hot/overly tannic) but is overall a decent Bourbon. My issue here is that I don't care for it any more or any less than the standard offering, whereas I find Maker's Mark Cask Strength, WT Rare Breed, ECBP, Booker's, etc. to all be significant upgrades to their proofed down siblings. For a Cask Strength Wheated Bourbon, I'll take the MMCS for the same $50 over this one every time."
4.25,"Nose: Caramel and spice. For the high proof, surprisingly not a lot of ethanol
Palate: Banana, oak, spice, and apple all come through nicely. 
Finish: clean finish with slight burn. Tobacco and caramel notes"

4.25,"Favorite wheated bourbon so far and maybe my favorite barrel proof yet. At this proof, usually water is needed, not with this one.
I like regular Larceny but this really adds depth on the nose and in the mouth. It’s got heat but no harshness, just a warm hug on the way down. Nose:caramel, butterscotch, maybe banana... Mouth: sweet smooth I get more bananas (banana nut bread), liqueur almost. 
My favorite part is the finish. It lets you know it’s barrel proof but not in a bad way. A little wood and a nice camp fire warmth. Took awhile to get ahold of this and not disappointed at all
At this price point #chickendinner"

4.25,"2 oz taster bottle shared by Chris the Mad Westover, thanks!  Neat in a Glencairn at home.  Nose is sweet with caramel and apple, honey butter, touch of grains and heat.  Very inviting.  Taste is smooth and sweet, more caramel, with vanilla and apple peel, almonds.  Heat comes on at the end, and lingers for a few moments, before giving a good Kentucky hug.  Very drinkable.  6/6/20."

4.25,"Larceny BP 520 has a fantastic nose. It has several different scents all the way from vanilla to worn out leather and tobacco leaf. There is Carmel, sweet butterscotch, apple peel and cherry on the nose as well. The palate is quite complex and somewhat spicy for a wheated bourbon. The palate starts with nutmeg and cinnamon which I normally get in the finish on most bourbons so it’s interesting. Then carmel, toffee, salted peanuts and maple syrup take over before a finish of leather and vanilla with some slight barrel spice and a warming Kentucky hug appear. The experience is enjoyable and unique in that it’s not near as sweet as I thought and gives off a great nose. The finish is pleasant and strong like you would expect but the mouthfeel is excellent! The oak tannins on the back end are present but held in check to my preference."
4.0,Strong vanilla front with balanced burn and a Carmel/Toffee finish.
