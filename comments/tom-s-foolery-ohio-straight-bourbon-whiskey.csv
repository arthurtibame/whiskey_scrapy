2.25,"Earthy, mild....not much else to say."
1.5,I was excited to try something made in state but was disappointed.  The flavor was very oaky and had too much tannin and leather flavor for my taste.  it has a distinct taste that was off putting to me and it lingers afterward. Apparently it is made with 23% malted barley which might be the cause.  Medium amount of heat and slightly oily feel.    Would not recommend.
