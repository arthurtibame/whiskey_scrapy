3.25,"Had this with Steven at The Wilder. It was pretty good, a little ‘salty’ and not smoky at all. Nothing too crazy or unusual, a decent scotch to have on a Saturday night. @sscheck is always a good tasting partner."

4.0,"General sweet floral and oak tones dominate initially, opening to express a deeper more complex violet and honey with an under tone of fresh grass and brine, ending in mild burnt peat with a hint of smoke. 

$65 in Kelowna, BC"

3.0,"Honey and mild to moderate sherried fruit sweetness enveloped in a puff of peat smoke. Finishes fast. Decent flavour but a bit simple, just a hint astringent. $75 in Ontario."

3.0,Has a nice sweetness but doesn’t blend well with the smokey.
4.0,Slightly salty with a tropical tinge. Great for the price.

2.0,"They've peated it, all right. First thing that hits your nose; very hard to pick up anything else. I don't get any of the sherry finish they mention. A splash of water dampens the alcohol burn and I get the familiar oak taste. Not much else. It's okay but not really enjoyable on its own. Received as a gift but I've given the standard retail price."
