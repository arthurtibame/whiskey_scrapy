5.0,"From the distiller: proofed at 92 (46% alcohol by volume) this aged American whiskey presents with a complex caramel and spiciness on the nose. It presents with a creamy mouthfeel and mild smoke on the palate. Bookended with mint, eucalyptus, and crisp spice, a warm and smooth chocolate malt middle balances the complexity of this whiskey to appeal to both the Scotch whisky and American whiskey palates."
