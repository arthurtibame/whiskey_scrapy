3.25,"Appearance: light caramel in color 

Nose: Sweet Apple and Oak dominate 

Palate: very gentle at first.  Heat begins to seep him slowly. Very simple flavor profile. Oak dominates, but I’m sure the more experienced enthusiast could pick out some of the more gentle flavors. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side.  

Finish: finishes strong.  Lingers long after the sip.  Heat is just about right - would not have minded a little more kick in the end.   

Good bourbon for the price point. Due to mouthfeel being a little thin, I think It would be enjoyable in a chilled glass, but even a big cube may water it down a little much."

4.0,"Yet another store pick from Elijah Craig, mostly going to focus on the difference between this pick and the standard offering. (Standard disclaimer that this review is primarily for my own records and most likely completely useless to those outside the Phoenix, AZ area)

Total Wine and More pick Barrel 5589802 Rickhouse T, Floor 6, 9 yr age

Nose on this one is killer; Lemonhead’s candy, and a big spice bouquet (allspice, ginger, and clove) that makes you want to dive right in. Some sweetness underneath but spices steal the show. 

On the palate this one is a like hot caramel bomb. Initial taste of Rollo’s candy followed by barrel spices and char, and ending with an oaky finish. Flavors richer, more integrated, and flow more smoothly from one flavor to next over the standard fare which I feel is too astringent on the finish.

One of the better EC picks I have had. Been slurping this down like water since I bought it. A rebuy at the standard TW pricing of $32."

3.75,Store pick so slight difference to the regular shelfer. Nose is very light with no stand out notes. Initial taste is a bit spicey as if it has a heavy rye mash. After an initial pepper burn it mellows nicely to reveal hints of vanilla and mild brown sugar. Closes with a medium burn and light cinnamon close. Decent sip at the price point and defintely preferred to the Buffalo Trace and Larceny entry level pours.

3.0,"My benchmark bourbon

Mash bill: 78% Corn, 10% Rye, 12% barley

Nose: caramel, sweet corn, cough medicine persists (candied cherry, do not like it too much), barely detectable nut, pepper, finish with oak

Palate: still practicing taste, too much alcohol for now, first time bitter (stay too long in the back of tongue), diluting with water helps; second time better. After sampling a cheap $20 blended cowboy whiskey, I appreciate EC’s Co complexity much more

Finish: long, 1-2 mins, coating mouth

Balance: complex, layers of flavor, wood residual fragrance at the bottom of glass"

3.5,"BACKGROUND: Elijah Craig bourbon is named for a Baptist minister from Virginia who moved to Kentucky and opened a distillery in 1789.  

Legend claims, though absolutely no proof exists, that Craig accidentally invented the process of aging whiskey in charred barrels after his barn caught fire.  Despite the fact that the fire, according to lore, charred barrels that were stored inside the barn, Craig decided to use them to ship his whiskey.  Customers who received the barrels were supposedly delighted with the effect that barrel char had upon its contents, and a new method of aging was born…or not.

Before his death in 1809, Craig’s distillery and farm would encompass roughly 4,000 acres, which were tended by several of his slaves, and he also operated a retail store in Frankfort, Kentucky to sell his bourbon product.

One of Craig’s contemporaries wrote at the time, “His preaching was of the most solemn style; his appearance as of a man who had just come from the dead; of a delicate habit, a thin visage, large eyes and mouth; the sweet melody of his voice, both in preaching and singing, bore all down before it.”

Though one would assume that a bourbon named after an 18th Century distiller would have a long and storied history, the first bottle of Elijah Craig was produced by Heaven Hill distillery only in 1986, and it used the same 78% corn, 10% rye, and 12% malted barley age statement as today.

Once carrying a 12-year age statement, it has since been dropped, and the bourbon is made from a blend of younger whiskies. A single barrel Elijah Craig with an 18-year age statement is still available, however.

The 94-proof, NAS bottle I sampled is a pick by the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control agency.

NOSE: The nose is reminiscent of a gentlemen’s club - not the strip club kind but the formal and elite kind with monocle-wearing dudes sporting smoking jackets - and offers a great combination of pipe tobacco, leather, and maple syrup..

PALATE: Despite the fact that it has no age statement, Elijah Craig has the same significant amount of oak as most well-aged bourbons.  Caramel and brown sugar are present, and a strong hint of cherries develops on the back of the palate.

FINISH: Oak and barrel char dominate the medium-to-long finish, but it is not at all drying.  A pleasant heat rises but stops and simmers at just the right level.

FINAL ASSESSMENT:  The ABC Select Spirits Elijah Craig barrel pick is a good, but not great, bourbon.  Though not complex, it is perfectly pleasant and does its job.  For the price of $24.99, it’s a satisfying daily drinker."

The nose has wonderful layers of crisp apple, vanilla, and cinnamon. Not apple pie, to fresh and 'crispy' for that.  Then the palate delivers a nice oily mouth feel, with great fruitiness and sweetness on the front. Then the spice and char hit, with a nice but not too hot cinnamon and oak to finish it. I wouldn't call this smooth, but it is not the alcohol that makes the burn, it is the rye and heavy char making a nice robust flavor. What a bourbon should be, and this is an incredible price point.  Not many better offerings in the $20-$30 range."

The oaky char hits the sides of the tongue, along with a mild burn. There is a smoldering and burnt out fireworks taste that adds such a lovely, ashy quality. The heat acts as a welcome counterpoint to the flavor, and not a barrier.

The spicy wood and citrus rind/peel adds a spiky little second wave; orange rind absolutely hangs out in the finish. The body is full and chewy. It's gives you a little smoke early on, before rewarding you with a spicy finish."

2.5,"SIP #1: Nose of apple cider vinegar or that blast of fumes that hits you when you walk into a busy nail salon. Initial spicy and hot bite hides the leather and vanilla, fades into that taste like you get when you’re almost ready to swallow a bite of red apple but all that’s left in your mouth to chew is the bitter red peel. For me, this is like a knock off eagle rare. It will love you long time, but don’t post any pictures as you won’t be proud tomorrow.
SIP #2: ""Nose of bitter red apple peel and fresh out of the box tennis shoes, flash of sugar cube sweetness on the lips, red popsicle on the tip of your tongue, with a hot but thin finish. Shines like a cubic zirconia on a MILF in a red dress."""

More heat than one would expect in a 94 proof whiskey, but smooth enough for a beginner.  Medium finish with a warmth that’s felt all the way down.  Although it scores a bit lower as it can’t be confused with WLW or even a Booker’s release, this is a really good pour for the price point."

This bourbon feels very light when sipped and is just sweet enough to complement the light, almost cinnamon/cloves/gingerbread spice that you taste throughout the middle. Towards the end, the burn definitely comes forward more and eases you down from the sweetness very well."

Palate (Kentucky chew) Lit Light Cherry infused cigar, red hots candy, atomic fireball Candy. Spiced sweetness. 

Finish: finish for me lasted about 2 mins after the sip. Long enough savor and make a impact. You'll want more for sure. I did.  

For $19.99 I feel I definitely got my money's worth. It's solid."
3.5,"Waited till this went on sale $27 then scooped it up. There seems to be a lot of disappointment compared to the 12 yr version. I never tried the 12 but this is supposedly 8yr which is still good by todays standards. Poured neat, good coating and legs. Nose is fantastic! Dark brown sugar, toasted marshmallows, little bit of baking and rye spice with some dusty oak. Very fresh and fragrant. Mouthfeel is thin but soft. Palate comes in hot with spicy cinnamon and caramel, nutmeg, rye dough and hefty black pepper oak. Its vibrant and aggressive flavor verging on harsh but walks the line. Finish is long oak and char with peppery heated cinnamon. This is spicy bourbon yet balanced with sweetness and oak. IMO it delivers on the profile of Four Roses single barrel without the excessive pepper and wood. .......85/100"

3.25,"Right from the beginning you can tell this is slightly higher proof than the average bourbon. 

Nose is full of caramels, dark fruits and baking spice, with a noticeable ethanol smell as well.

Palate starts off as alcohol burn, but immediately takes a back seat so that you can enjoy the spice, with just the faintest hint of sweetness. Mid palate is full with lots of legs and finishes with a mild but consistent heat. 

A very good bourbon which can hold up to water or ice but doesn't need it. When drinking it I feel like I should be sitting in front of a fire in an old leather chair at Christmas time.. but every other night will have to do."

I won’t say I got to taste this “properly”, but we had dinner with my neighbor and she was kind enough to buy this for me because she knows I’m a whiskey drinker. High marks just for that. 

I can’t say too much visa vi tasting notes because the focus of the evening was on conversation rather than nosing and tasting, but I can say this was one of the finest bourbons for casual sipping I e had in ages. I’ve been close to loosing my faith in bourbon the past year, and lately if had a few drams, this included, that have helped restore the faith. All the classic bourbon notes are present and perfectly balanced. Why I haven’t tried this before is beyond me. Well done, Heaven Hill. Well done indeed. 

As an addendum, it was a real treat to just interact with another human being (besides my lovely wife) tonight. It was a bonus that this awesome dram got to play a part in that."

The nose is complex and dry. There are notes of leather, dusty corn, vanilla, cherry syrup, Chardonnay wine , caramel, and salted peanuts.

The palate has notes of caramel, dark chocolate, red apple skins, molasses, and BBQ char.

The finish has notes of baking spices, has a little burn going down, and has a medium-ish length. Cheers!"

3.75,"Total Wine Store Pick (Gilbert AZ)  8yr, Rickhouse G, Floor 7

(This review mostly for my own notes and probably useless to those outside the AZ area and will focus on the difference between this store pick and the standard)

I actually bought this thinking it was a restock of a recent-ish 9 yr pick, and didn’t realize it was a different pick until I got it home. (Oops) Main difference here is less caramel and more fruit forward; specifically baked apple skin. Surprisingly large oak presence on the back end for the age but not as astringent with it as the regular offering. Not many other differences, possibly due to the relatively low age for a EC pick.

All in all a very small improvement with this pick which makes it a decidedly ho-hum affair but on the other hand, TW didn’t do the standard up charge for it so there’s that."

Hints of butterscotch and mustiness are primary, with the alcohol coming in too. On the tongue, this bourbon starts out almost seeming like a rye, being hot and spicy. It cools off in the middle while still displaying its 94 proof strength. The swallow is sweet, full, and bold, with the vanilla, corn, butterscotch, and other fruity notes finishing it off -- with a little extra burn on the way down."

4.0,"Store pick. A world apart from the barrel proof version, which I find oppressive.

The main flavor here (take a guess) is caramel, with an orangey note mixed in, which gives it some acidic brightness. Medium char, a little cinnamon, and just a bit of a floral/ethanol punch to keep you awake. Mysteriously absent are vanilla and cherry, in an otherwise typical bourbon, but I’m not missing them too much.

This won’t blow your mind, but if you’re just looking for some good everyday bourbon-ass bourbon, this is not a bad choice at all. There are basically no flaws to speak of, which is really nice for a $30 bourbon. You can pay a lot more for a lot less."

Finish: Smooth, both a leathery and sweet aftertaste, buttery linger, and slight sting from the alcohol.

I'm no stranger to strong alcohol, but I don't find this bourbon to be very pleasant to drink. The price is okay if you just want something on the lower shelves to have, but I feel it's too perfumey and unbalanced to simply drink and not think much about it. Also, for just a regular bourbon, the oak is underwhelming but a liking for stronger oak may just be my preference."

Age: 11 years (Bardstown)
Rickhouse: U
Floor: 6
Barrel: 5256743

Liquor Barn Selection (2020)

Nose: honey, dust, oak, caramel, leather

Taste: rich with heavy nutmeg, hints of butterscotch and a little vanilla 

Finish: decent amount of bite compared to previous bottles of this I’ve had. And a medium finish. 

Being this bourbon is one year younger than what used to be the standard Elijah Craig 12-year, I had high hopes for this one. It’s a little flat in my opinion. The nose is very nice but it doesn’t deliver by the finish. Will have to come back and revisit this after a few weeks of the bottle being opened. 

However, at $30 for a fifth from a single barrel, 11-year-old bourbon is very hard to complain about."
