3.0,"In the nose, warm vanilla custard, mixed fruits, mild sherry, hints of oak, maybe a touch of chocolate.  Taste: molasses on toast with very little butter, hints of sherry, dark or slightly sweet chocolate.  Given time in the glass, it gets a bit softer and sweeter.  Finish is moderate in length, overall a very good Scotch.  Imo, this 15 is a better value than the 18 Allardice."

4.0,"Revival is smooth and easy, yet complex.

Nose: Starts with intense sherry and rubbery side smell. Develops into malty citrus and dried fruits. Water brings the toffee.

Taste: Toffee and malt in a nice thick way. Nuts and sherry delicately on the side and dry notes, like dark chocolate and dried fruits.

Finish: Spices and oak in a dry and warming way. Sweet fruits rise in the aftertaste.

Balance: Rich, best sherried whisky, I've tried so far."

4.0,"Nose: At first nosing it's dense sherry, christmas spice, and oak.  Found myself wondering where the event was.  After breathing (for weeks), it opened up considerably and added intense dark chocolate, coffee, lessened the butter into a mild savory note.  Palate: Lovely profile with a dense mouthfeel.  Coffee, dark chocolate, and pipe tobacco all over the place.  It's clearly cask-driven, but wow is it good.  It's savory and yet dessert-like.  Christmas spice and drying oak present again with also some leather.  Delicious and comforting.  Finish: Sherry again, lingering spice, slightly drying oak, and coffee.  Lovely stuff.  Final Thoughts: Something to sip in a library built of mahogany with leather-bound books.  I can see why everyone likes this.  It's a keeper."

5.0,"A Macallan killer. With notes of dried fruit—apricot and figs, in particular—pecan, and a touch of cinnamon, this creamy sherry bomb contains whisky notably older than the 15-year age statement suggests. Now a personal favorite, this expression is less sweet than the 12-year and lacks the 18-year's sappiness. Along with a few others on this app, I consider it the strongest of GlenDronach's standard bottlings."

Long lovely finish,  starts with smoke and pepper and then segues into a lovely red fruit finish.  Very nice whisky, overpowered a bit by a peppery taste.

Addendum: Been drinking this whisky for a while now, the peppery taste has vanished, It is just a lovely whisky. Sad we may not see the likes of it agian. Luckily, I hoarded a few bottles away."

4.5,"If you are on a malt treasure hunt, watch out for the word 'discontinued'. GlenDronach 15 was easily the best whisky of the distillery's core range. The nose is overwhelmingly complex with balsamic vinegar, overripe berries, raisins, maraschino cherries and a touch of mint. A rich and powerful sherry arrival underscores the caliber of the casks used in maturation. Notes of coffee, dark chocolate, cinnamon and walnuts mingle with dried fruits, herbs and tannins. Substantial, savory and pleasantly spicy in the finish, this bottling is a real beauty of a Single Malt!

RATING: 4.5/5.0 stars ≙ 91 pts → SUPERB"

5.0,"Simply delightful. Nose: figgy caramel, sweet and savory sherry, rich oak (exeptional quality casks, similar to Benromach). Slight salty-sour vegetal note in the background, like a half-sour garlic pickle (in a very good way). Palate: crisp sweet apple, more quality oak, deep, earthy, slowly bittering, yet still somehow delicate. Finish: warming vanilla, bitter oak spices, drying orange peel. Many make comparisons to Macallan, but this is more reminiscent of a Dalmore, albeit sans cocoa, in my opinion. Dry glass: sweet malt and earthy Brazil nuts."

4.0,"Had this before and with some BBQ (best I've had, and cheap half price ribs Friday nights) at Old Faithful before Bayside gig. Packed but good atmosphere with friendly staff knocking back shots and mucking about. We sat at the bar watching little orange fish get sliced for cocktails. Saw this one and had to try it seeing as though I'd been looking for a bottle with no luck (temporarily unavailable for a year or two). This was one of the best whiskies I've tasted, easily. Smells good, tastes better. A fair few seem to be the other way round. It's sweet but not like some others where it seems to be just from honey, toffee etc. Rich fruit caramelised with brown sugar. Good sweet pastries with toasty edges. Longish finish is delicious with slight pepper and mellow spices. So good! Must buy when it comes back around. Ordered a rocked High West Campfire to finish after this which was good, but should have had another of these. Both were cheap too. Some units next to us started getting rowdy shouting ""RIBS!"" And then tried to start something arguing with the bar staff just before we left for the gig. All quite good entertainment. Bayside sounded mint, top night"

4.75,"I've been drinking this bottle for a year now and I've swung between this and the 18 year Glendronach as my favourite. I lined this up against the 15, 21 and 25 Glenfarclas last night (newly opened) and this came out on top. In one word 'toffee'....in spades. For me perhaps to much but I'm still rating it a 5 as even after a year it has a richness and depth like no other sherried whisky. It really has improved over the year I've had the bottle open which is rare for whiskeys I find as their flavour usually fades.

Update many years later and another bottle. This is truly great stuff surpassing the bottle of the 18yr I matched it up against."
4.0,"I think I found another contender for an ""everyday dram"".  I'm quite liking this---the aroma is like walking into a leather tannery.   In Mumbai, in the Dharavi district ( a huge flavela, similar to Rio's), I remember entering into this one tannery.  You get the smell of soft leather, cigarettes, burnt earth, and mud.  That's what this smells like.  In a good way.   Taste is crisp apples, molasses, and Dunkin Donuts hazelnut coffee.  I love the finish...warming and nutty.  I need to look into buying a full bottle.  This sample was courtesy of Davie...thank you!!!"

5.0,"Bottled 2015/05/12 = ~20 year old juice

Nose - Dark stone fruits, dark toffee, orange zest, dark chocolate, hint of candied ginger.

Taste - Nice thick/chewy mouthfeel, sweet dark stone fruits, hint of orange zest, candied ginger spice, dark chocolate covered dark toffee.

Finish - Nice lingering dark stone fruity syrupy sweet, light ginger spice, candied orange peel, light fruity bitter orange pith.

Score - 90/100

Final Thoughts - This was an interesting dram in that the first few pours I had from the bottle had a bit more bitter and off putting notes that somehow mysteriously disappeared when I poured this dram for review. I can see why people like this one as looking back on my notes, they are very similar to the GlenDronach 21 which might make sense because this particular bottling supposedly makes it a 20 year. I think this bottle needed a bit of air time & I'm glad I gave it a bit of air time before reviewing it because it has massively changed in just a few days of opening.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes

Would I buy a bottle? - Maybe, I value this around $80-90"

Oily mouthfeel with an instant hit of sweetness with a full mouth spice gradually building into the finish.

Finish is medium long with a slight burn down the hatch, which dissipates into fruity sweetness again. These flavors linger on the back of the tongue until the next sip.

Favorite thing about this is the Sherry sweetness combined with the burn, both coming and going synchronously to create a great drinking experience."
4.5,"Fantastic! This GD15 was bottled in 2013 and, since GD was mothballed from 1996-2001, this is a minimum of 17-18 years old. 

This one is all about the mouthfeel - its incredibly rich and syrupy but not cloyingly so; it travels evenly across the palate and has a long warming finish.

The flavors are deliciously melded together - a combo of dark chocolate, toffee, toasty oak, tangerine, bing cherry, roasted almonds, candied ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg. 

Can’t speak to the new GD15 but this one is wonderful!"

4.0,"Representing the east highlands

Nose: fruit, dark cherry and chocolate. Oak sneaks out. Dark raisin from the sherry (?) light apricot and more fruity with time. Maraschino cherry sneaks out in time. And late hits of pepper. 

Body: smooth, medium

Palate: whoa. Oak and chocolate and dry fruit, it’s sweet but more like dark chocolate sweet as opposed to milk chocolate sweet. The initial impression is unique. Mild spice. Hint of orange cream. 

Finish: long with dark chocolate and cherry, like a cordial. 

Note: whoa. I think I felt late heat coming out of my ears. There is a lot going on here. Got a hint of glenglassaugh revival in hint of orange on the palate but it’s very subtle and good when light. Got a little more oaky and sherry-ie at the end which isn’t my style as much but it’s so mature it works. Almost a little hint of smoke or char at the end. Very good."

4.5,"Wow, a 15 that tastes like a 20+ - this is a fantastic pour with great mouth feel and a smooth clean finish. Every product i’v tasted by Glendronach has been absolutely stellar - It’s nice to see a company that underpromises and over delivers- they have amazing quality, all of their whisky is complex and though provoking, smooth and spicy at the same time. IMO Glendronach produces some of the finest whiskey in the entire world; up there with Buffalo Trace and Macallan- BUT without all the BS hype, overpricing and 2nd hand market gouging. I’m a huge huge fan."

Juicy fruits and creamy malt with balanced oak are ever present but in a restrained elegant way. There is no ethanol to speak of so dive right in there. Thick viscous mouthfeel lead palate of said sherry fruits and malt with seasoned oak and a nice twist of dark roast coffee peat. Its so succulent and smooth you question the abv. Finish is long and comforting. Warming with more malt and red fruits(starburst strawberry im going with) . The wood notes gently fade away never turning bitter. Absolutely superb scotch easily worth the $90 I paid.....98/100..........Now I need to talk myself into shelling out for the 18............Hello Alice Im coming, see you soon"

3.75,"Nice whiskey, but did not wow me. Some toffee and nutty sherry on the nose and palate, medium finish is a little rough and spicey. A splash of water adds some orchard fruit on the nose and makes the palate creamier."

4.25,"spicy, sweet, easy drink, probably better with a little water  shorter finish than expected not sure its worth 75"
4.75,"Slightly better than the 12, but not much. It’s a little lighter and not as heavy as the 12. Very dark color. Great sherry notes. Longish finish. More chocolate In the nose than the 12."

4.5,"GlenDronach 15 Revival 2018 Release
Nose - Dark cherries, dark cocoa nibs, treacle toffee, hint of orange zest, dark raisins

Taste - Dark cherries, light bitter chocolate/orange pith, syrupy dried stone fruits, gentle candied ginger spice

Finish - Lingering dark chocolate covered dried sweet cherries, light metallic tingle, flamed orange zest

Score - 89/100

Final Thoughts - So this one is quite tasty as expected. Surprisingly I got very similar notes as the old expression after looking back on my notes of that release. Nice darkly sherried highland malt with hints of chocolates & orange zest. What's not to like about this one (minus the light metallic note on the finish)?

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes

Would I buy a bottle? - Yes"
4.5,"Nose: Bavarian cream, dark fruits and a gingery freshness that reminds me of a great Irish.  A buttery oloroso hits the palette with a long mellow development. A fantastic dram."
3.5,"The nose starts with sweet trail mix, lots of wild honey, blueberries, peach, fresh warm butter apple pie - with a strong base of fruit juice (a little irritating is a fragment of apple vinegar)

The palate is sweet and spicy. Ripe apples, cotton candy, whole grain crackers.

Nice whisky with an intense palette of flavors and aromas with a quiet long finish. Impressive also that just a few drops of water makes it even more intense and sweet. Really well crafted. A good all-rounder that offers quiet a big variety of features."

4.25,Difficult to place the initial nose; caramel apple is how I can best define this. Smooth/oily when it hits the tongue. An immediate sweetness that tones down by the second to end in a beautiful fruity bouquet.
4.25,"On the nose, I get dark fruits, like plums or raisins. It fades off to cinnamon and nutmeg. First taste is astounding, not as boozy as expected. Rich and oily, it builds gradually to a delicious warmth. Mild honey fades to Honey Graham cereal. Best with dinner of Argentine-style chorizo grilled over an open flame with a small green salad on the side."

4.25,"Okay this is a macho dram. I should have taken it with a couple water drops but i didn't. 

On the nose it is gentle, and maybe uninteresting at first. Plum is present, sherry, grapy aromas become more perfumed as it rests in the glass. After a while nosing it i got raisings with chocolate like the ones you buy in the movies. After tasting it once, i also noticed vanilla.

On the palate, it is a whole different story. Very strong, very hot and spicy. Oak, wood, nuts and red chilli is present. It is a hot dram, full bodied and not very gentle. The finish is strong but medium long.

It is my type of whisky and i recognize it as a good dram that most people will enjoy. A lot of character and power. 89/100."
