4.5,"Sweet and spicy with full vanilla to the nose. Like sugar cookies baking. First sip is a forest full of oak in the fall as the leaves fall, then swallow and the charred oak and full alcohol flavors come out. Finishes with lingering cinnamon red hots and mouth and lip numbing. Second sniff is less spice and more sugar and vanilla. Some fruit notes, orange peel maybe. Second sip sweet, rich, and full. Oily smoky finish that stays on your tongue for your lasting enjoyment. Top 3 in my collection."
