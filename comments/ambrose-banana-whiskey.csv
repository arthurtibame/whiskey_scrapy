3.5,"Definitely not like Laffy-Taffy or Runts. Has a very “authentic” banana flavor. The nose and palate are extremely similar to an overripe banana/plantain. Can almost be off putting at first, but 2 or 3 sips in and it all starts to make sense. As expected, banana is the dominant flavor with notes of vanilla, toffe and caramel that linger."
5.0,Very smooth finish with a lingering banana aftertaste. Goes well with Angels & Demons Cinnamon Whiskey and Michael's Irish Cream for a Banana Bread Shot
5.0,"like true over ripened bananas, not a fake flavor"
