4.25,This tastes like a mixture of highland scotch (Talisker maybe?) and redbreast or greenspot. Light peat gives way to sherry and pears. Easy sipping with a dry finish at a decent price point

null,Tried this at the whisky extravaganza. Has a good sweet and sour green apple flavor. Nice to have outside during a barbecue.
