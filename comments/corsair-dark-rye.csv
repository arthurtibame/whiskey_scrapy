3.5,Aroma is warm and heavy with a depth beyond its months – pulling through rustic and darkly sweet profiles; Palate walks down the same paths but with more pronounced woody “craft” notes and dark chocolate covered cherries and pops of menthol moving about; Finish is soft and starts sweet before fading to more rustic and an almost tannic profile.
