4.75,"2016 Booker's Toogie's Invitation: 6Yrs 4Mos 4Days @ 129proof  
APPEARANCE: The color of Rich Maple Syrup. Poured into my Glencairn thick and clingy. It took forever to form small slow moving legs.
NOSE: Sweet. Burnt Brown Sugar, Vanilla, Peanut Brittle, Kellogg's Corn Pops Cereal, Honey. If ""sticky"" had a smell, this is it. There are hints of Orange Peel, Oak, and some Cinnamon joins the party after some time. Despite the 128 proof, surprisingly there isn't much heat on the nose. 
NEAT: WOW! This is Rocket Fuel! Syrupy, Clingy, Delicious Rocket Fuel. The Orange Peel is front and center, followed by Vanilla and Honey. The Beam Peanut Funk is there, but sweeter than on the standard Beam. There is a slightly medicinal Cherry note as well. The Oak that is here comes across as slightly astringent. Nice Long Finish with a more than respectable Kentucky Hug. The aftertaste is Burnt Peanut Brittle and it layers with each coating sip. The high proof does start to numb the tongue, so before I lose the tastebuds completely, I add a small capful of spring water.
SPLASH: That little bit of water amplifies the Orange note even more. Adds some Cinnamon and Black Pepper tingle  to the mix as well. Another small capful of water and the astringency is completely gone. The Brown Sugar takes over, along with Sticky Caramel and Honey. The whole experience has become like the old school McDonald's Caramel Sundae with Crushed Peanuts sprinkled on it, but in liquid form.
VERDICT: I'm not the world's biggest Beam fan, but man am I kicking myself for not trying Booker's sooner. This bottle was purchased online from Ace Spirits for $40 right before they announced the price jump. Wishing now that I'd gotten two. If you are in a part of the country where ""dusty hunting' is a thing, keep an eye out for this one. One of the best bourbons I've ever had. Being stuck at home for the better part of a week now lead me to open something at the back of the cabinet collecting dust. May do another one soon. There's an Elmer T Lee and a Forged Oak lurking back there as well, though they've got a hard act to follow after the Booker's."
4.5,"Nose- lots of vanilla and caramel 

Taste- more complex than I'm used to. Lots of vanilla, oak and nuts. Smoky. The 129 proof gives a good burn. 

Finish- the flavor lingers and the burn is easily drinkable. 

It's aged over 6 years and it's noticeable. One of the best bourbons I've ever had. Good smoke and spice with a great flavor. 

Water deadens the flavor but not the burn. Better beat."

4.0,"Caramel, cinnamon, bread on the nose.
Baking spice, vanilla, toffee and a good Kentucky hug make a toasted vanilla and sweetish finish great. Not the best batch, but good."
3.75,"Star anise on the nose right away, with the smell of melted butter wafting upward out of the glass. Beyond these and more typical bourbon smells, this one smells pleasantly of a rotting, moss-covered log, making six years seem like sixty. More anise and licorice on the palate, along with toasted cashews and caramel corn. The finish is time-stopping inside, but leave it on your lips and this bourbon is so alcoholic that it evaporates within three seconds."

null,The worst of the whole line. It isn’t even improved by mixing. Sorry I’m not good with tasting notes but when you’re a Booker’s fan and have tasted all the others this is damn near rancid.
