4.0,I disagree with Distiller. I'd rate this a solid 89-90. It's very good. It is sweet though. As far as wheaters  go I like this better than larceny and right up there with old weller antique
3.0,Quite a bite without the rye influence. Caramel and vanilla. Smooth and velvet on the tongue. Coating.

2.0,"I find myself wanting to like all of the 1792's and then when I find them, buy them, and then try them, I find myself wanting just a little more out of them. So far the regular small batch is my favorite and after trying the sweet wheat and port finish, which both seem to be backed by this medicinal cough syrupy finish that must be common with 1792, I see no need to ever stock anything other than the small batch."

3.0,"On the nose, some standard floral wheat notes plus... banana. Yep, banana. And vanilla ice cream, so if you get banana split from this I can see why. This is indeed sweet; it tastes like banana pudding with vanilla wafers, and once I realized that it brought a smile to my face. There are some oak notes as well. The finish is mostly short, with a bit of bitterness that lingers. This is a soft sipper, but it does have some heat that stings you every now and then. This is like a tiramisu dessert that has alcohol in it, except instead of tiramisu it's banana pudding. If you're in the restaurant business, feel free to steal that idea, just give me a free dessert if I show up for a meal. 4/30/17"

The nose is just awesome, but the palate and finish is a step below Maker's Mark. Worth a buy at msrp for the nose and comparison experience for a seasoned wheater fan, but lacks the oak or complexity a Weller 107 or 12yr brings to the table"

4.0,"Nose - Sweet vanilla caramels, fairly oaky, brief hints of cherry/strawberries.
Taste - Spicy fruity vanilla sweet simple syrup, cherry/strawberry soda, light oak bitterness that's kind of weird, light cinnamon/white pepper heat.
Finish - Lingering sweet, white pepper heat, fruity vanilla simple, lingering oak bitterness.
Score - 85/100
Final Thoughts - This is a pretty tasty bourbon. Nice nose for sure but it definitely needs a bit of air time to fully bloom, and it does deliver mostly on the palate with classical wheated bourbon notes. Nice fruity vanilla but then there's this extra spice component along with this odd bitterness that kind of throws it off balance. Closest thing I can use to describe it is an oaky bitterness, but that doesn't really do it justice. Regardless, not too bad of a wheated bourbon, but at least here in WA state, the price is a bit of a turn off since I can get OWA for less."

4.0,"Dark honey colored. Lighter-medium bodied with a slightly oily mouthfeel.

Nose: rich caramel and milk chocolate sweetness accented by orange peel. Brown sugar fills out the rest.  

Palate: Caramel and milk chocolate sweetness at the start. Brown sugar rises through the middle along with some mild oak. Finish is quick and warming leaving brown sugar and gentle oakiness on the palate. Very smooth and pleasant from start to finish. 

A simple, pleasant, sweet & smooth dram. Easy to sip, easy to enjoy.

3.9/5 or 4/5 on here - This is the best 1792 expression I’ve tried and I’ve had this, Full proof, Single Barrel, and the ubiquitous small batch."

N: Sweet spice and slight fruity. No not like fruit punch dang it

P: spice and vanilla and then cherry comes through. Think vanilla cream soda with a cherry on top.

F: Dry and sweet, little burn. Probably the best part of the dram....as usual. You can almost taste sweet creamed corn as it lingers.

Beautiful whiskey. If you get a chance to try it, do so. If you don't, your loss."

3.75,"Sweet is definitely in more than this bottle's namesake. From the onset, there's a nose that brings back a pleasant memory of Sweet Tarts or Jolly Ranchers. From there, while this bourbon is perhaps a bit thin, the candy continues with a taste. There's a little touch of heat on the back-end that lingers in a good way and the sweetness almost changes to a cherry flavored soda. Overall, it's a nice pour, which is probably much better if you're able to find it for retail pricing, as opposed to buying it on the secondary market. Enjoy, cheers!"

3.25,"This is a Bourbon that has gathered a bit of a cult following and one that I have heard mixed reviews on. Some feel it's too spicy, others too sweet. I haven't seen it in my market for over a year, so it's become difficult to find. I saw it and was happy to give it a try. On to the review:
Initially is a big burst of brown sugar, vanilla and butterscotch. Pretty sweet. The sweetness lingers and then you get a spice swell (clove and rye) on a pretty long finish. It's not complex but it's easy to drink and pretty tasty. Nothing worth hunting for, but it's worth the $9 pour and $24 price I see it go for (if it's ever back in stock). A notch above Weller Special Reserve, Larceny and Maker's. Inferior to Rebel 10, other Weller's, Wyoming and Garrison Bros. 
Cheers all!"

3.75,"I'd say I enjoy 1792 products as a whole, and I am curious to see how this rarer expression stacks up. Onto the review...

On the nose, butterscotch bomb for days. Also caramel, bubblegum, pencil shavings, cocoa butter, and an indistinct citrus. Pleasant to huff.

Palate takes a distinct turn with banana, cream soda, stone fruits (specifically peach), white chocolate, and cinnamon. Flavors are decently rich. 

Really tasty nougat note in the finish; like inside of a three musketeers bar. The indistinct citrus in the nose finally presents itself as pear along with some oak and a cooling menthol that extends the finish to ""long"" when the other flavors stop at ""medium"" length. Thin and dry mouthfeel. 

Overall a pleasant experience. Lacks a little punch and body; I have a feeling that a little more proof would make this a smash, but as it is it's still solid. At $40 it's a decent enough value for what you receive. Scores an extra .25 for uniqueness."
4.0,Sweet with a bit of heat going down.
4.0,"Nose: Caramel and vanilla. Quite a bit of alcohol. For the proof...surprised?

3.5,"Not sure why all the low reviews, very similar to Weller Special Reserve which gets much higher ratings.

Nose is full of banana, bubblegum and some clove... also hints of bakingbread.

Taste is not terribly complex, but most wheaters aren’t in my opinion. Soft wheat bread topped with bananas, and a butterscotch, caramel drizzle sums it up. Lingering baking spice, notably clove, aftertaste with a touch a heat.

Finish is dry and has a nice longer. The more I drink it the more I like it."

5.0,"Day 1 of my bourbon advent calendar

Nose: A warming invitation of oak sweetness, brown sugar, cinnamon, and a subtle banana note.

Palate: Starts very basic with just oak, and a little bit of vanilla, but then a favor bomb goes off on the finish that is chocolatey, and a strong nor of a sweet wheat bread... Hence its name😬


By far one of my favorite whiskeys that i own, and im gonna be sad when i can't find it anymore, but with that being said this is one to stock up on when you come across it. I gave this to someone on ice who doesn't like whiskey at all, and it change their opinion about whiskey."

3.75,"Nose: Vanilla, icing, some very subtle baking spices and faint black pepper.  Oak, but very soft and rounded.  Roasted peanuts.  Toffee.  Bread.  Bananas, neon red maraschino cherries, strawberries.  Very candied throughout.

Palate: Vanilla, icing, and that rounded oak.  More tannin than I was expecting, though nothing crazy.  Canned peaches, cinnamon and nutmeg.  Bananas and strawberries here, as well - think bubblegum.  Lots of mid and high palate, but no lower palate to speak of.  Ethanol is present in the mouthfeel with a relatively high level of ""effervescence"" that helps this not seem like just a glass of syrup.  Medium mouthfeel.  Finish begins with a pop of alcohol, canned peaches with vanilla-flavored whipped cream, and a touch of hot cinnamon and black pepper.  As the booze subsides, slowly the tannin and strawberries, bananas, and a touch of barrel come through.  And that's pretty much it.  Medium-short finish.

Other notes: This is a very middle-of-the-road wheater.  The proof is just about on point - any higher and the sweetness would become cloying and unappealing.  Any lower and there'd be no character left.  This isn't as simple and straightforward as, say, Larceny or Maker's Mark.  Indeed, I poured a splash of Larceny just after finishing this and the Larceny presented as brighter and less complex.  I'd love to see this finished in port or sherry casks to help build up the lower palate.  All that being said, it is bang-on for what it is.  It might not be trying anything terribly new or different, but sometimes there's nothing wrong with that."
