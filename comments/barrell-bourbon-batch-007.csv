3.75,"Hot as eff.  If you can get through the firewall, flavors are pleasant, oaky, maybe orange/citrus fruit."
3.75,"Heat hit liked a ton of bricks , but after your mouth adjusts it’s a very good pour . Nice Orange peel and bright cherry notes highlight this pour. Nice different expression from earlier barrell batches"

5.0,Excellent.
4.0,"Smells like sweet walnuts. Proof is evident on the nose. Initially on the tongue it's smooth and sweet, the heat doesn't hit you until later. Syrupy, nutty, with wood notes, spice, dark chocolate, and bitters on the end. Finish is potent but doesn't linger, it begs for another sip. Fantastic pour. 3/3/17
Almost 7 months since I first opened this bottle, and I'm down to the last quarter. Distinct cinnamon on the nose, sweet and nutty. Great nose. Sweet up front, you get wood and licorice as well. The heat cascades, as well as the spice. The rye notes really shine, much more than when the bottle was new. Orange peel and cacao nibs towards the end. The spice and slight bitterness lingers a bit. Sharp Kentucky hug. This has developed with air time. Still delicious. 9/29/17"

2.0,"Interesting but nothing particularly special in this batch. Sweet taste but a bit aggressive, could be more nuanced and smooth. Not a bad drink, but would not spend $90 on a bottle for this batch."

3.0,I enjoy this dram. Warm with enjoyable barrel notes and some side-of-the-tongue tingles I associate with rye. Finish is quick. Many of the people that have tried it describe it as dry.
