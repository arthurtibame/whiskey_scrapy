4.0,Almost makes me think of a wine that has gone through malo. Very full mouth feel that coats the throat.  Brown butter curd and rich vanilla extract.  Appreciate the depth but the finish is a bit off for me.

3.0,Spicy on the nose which surprised me for a Woodford product. Small quick tails. The proof is forward on the palette which is odd for the proof. Tingly on the palette and some sweet notes. The finish is quick and has wine notes.
