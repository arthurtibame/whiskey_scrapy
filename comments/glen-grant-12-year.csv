4.0,As always Glen Grant is the king of texture. Creamy silk texture embellishes the milky malt core on the palate. Vanilla pudding on the mid palate. Yummy! Lots of citrus shrouded by smoke. I enjoyed this but it made me yearn for the yonder years when I had (the even creamier) Glen Grant 10yr on the shelf.

4.0,"This is a fine aperitif malt, and such a step up (for me) from the 10 year old. Big fruit on the nose - apple, banana, pear, little bit of spice. The palate has more richness to it than I expect from Glen Grant - banana, toffee, ripe apple, creamy vanilla (especially with a drop of water). This is well worth the extra step up in price from the Major's Reserve or the (now discontinued and harder to find) 10 year."

3.0,had neat.  very light nose.  alcohol vapor throughout.   very light.  wouldn't call it floral.
4.0,"Sweet aroma of pear with dried peach, Christmas mince and hints of smoke. Oily viscosity with a big hit of flavour. Rich malts, plenty of smoke and oak. Really bold with a lingering aftertaste.  More to it than other speysides I've tried."

4.0,"A wonderful and complex whisky with notes of pear, malted barley, and toffee. The body carries a good amount of weight for its ABV, with a pleasant finish that is spicy and nutty. I very much enjoyed this."
3.0,"Very light on the nose with honey. The palate is smooth, with honey and peaches. The finish is short and smooth. This is an easy opener for a flight or for those new to scotch."
4.0,"Nose: fruit caramel, fresh barley
Taste:easy, sweet, not very orates, sweet barley"

4.0,"A very approachable and high value single malt. Definitely recommended.

Nose: a fruity bouquet with pineapple and cherries, and faintly floral like lilac. Taste is a sweet with honeysuckle, lemon, sweet tea. But then it backs off to a bit of brine and oak wood. Surprisingly long finish with a hint of white pepper. Would buy again."

3.75,"If you can get this for $29.99 like I can from my local liquor store, it's a no-brainer to buy. On the mild side as far as peat and smoke, but as distiller.com profile suggests, it is fairly rich in flavor. Pear and vanilla seem to be what I taste most in this. Maybe a little peach. Kind of fruity."

3.75,"Nose is sweet and sharp with stone fruits, baked apples and vanilla. Arrival is all of the sweetness the nose promised along with a minty green note and ends with a dry sourness. Finish is short, dry and mostly tannic. All in all, pleasant. Wish I had access to the un-chill filtered version to see what this malt is missing."
4.0,"Nose brings notes of apple pie, pear, honey and a touch of vanilla.  Very nice fruit notes.  Taste reminds me of toast with tart cherries and slight oak char.  Finishes very smooth with more fruit and a bit of pepper.  A very nice dram for the ‘Black Friday’ cost."

4.5,"What a wonderful Speysider! Nose and mouth delight in notes of honey, apple and pear fruit, baked pie crust or biscuit, and caramel and vanilla. There is no smoke or sherry here. In reminds me a lot of Glenmorangie 10, but not as floral. A couple years ago I preferred the 10 year expression, but this has come into it's own."
3.5,"Nose - Honey, caramel, and light fruitiness, hints of vanilla.

Taste - hits the tongue very smooth and mellow. Slight nuttiness at the end with hardly any bite at the finish. Definitely would recommend for a casual or beginning scotch drinker."

3.5,"Typical Speyside. Honey, orchard fruit, a touch of vanilla, white grapes, and confectioner’s sugar. Not bad if competitively priced with the likes of Glenlivet 12."
1.75,"Not Smokey at all, or oaky. This has such a fruity flavor it almost reminds me or a grape, like a wine. I don’t care for the blend of flavors. Thanks for the taste though, Thomas!"

4.5,"A delicious and affordable classic speyside. Light and fruity but with enough complexity to be interesting. 

Nose - appel, vanilla, floral notes and malty overtones  
Taste - like caramel apple and vanilla ice cream, with orange peel and floral notes
Finish - light and sweet, oily and lingering, a bit of heat going down"
