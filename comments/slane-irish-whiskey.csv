2.5,"Nose: Orchard fruits, berries, mild floral aroma, caramel, lightly toasted grains. You could easily believe this is a bourbon from the nose.

Palate: A very soft arrival, and most un-bourbon-like. Sweet and creamy like a bowl of untoasted fruit muesli with sweetened vanilla yoghurt drizzled with light honey. No development to speak of at all – it’s all up front right at the start - but it’s very pleasant.

Finish: Moderate, with sweet cereal flavours trailing out. A little too sweet overall.

Very well constructed, perfectly enjoyable, easy to drink, but maybe a touch engineered for its own good. Just enough complexity to give it some interest but not so much that you have to even think about it.

A good, reasonably priced, everyday whisky to have on hand for when you just want to chill out with a straightforward easy-going dram. I'd put this on the same shelf as other good midrange blended whisk(e)ys like JW Double Black or Bushmills Black Bush, although it'snoticably sweeter. It's average, but good average and only just falls short of 3 stars.

""Average"" : 2.5 stars"

3.0,"There was no way I was getting out of Total Wine without a bottle of this. No, it's not because I expected something mind-boggling, or because its reputation preceded it, or even because I'm an Irish whiskey completist whose approach to the ever-increasing number of bottles available over here is Pokemon-esque in its dedication to catchin' them all. Nope, it was because of the name. Slane, an Irish village along the Boyne River, lends its name to a hymn tune; you're most likely to know it as ""Be Thou My Vision"" (which I often sing to my daughter, as it's a favorite of mine), but it's also used for ""Lord of All Hopefulness,"" which my wife and I used in our wedding. So, there's a sentimental attachment here.

So, that got the bottle off the shelf, but how's the juice? It's a solid, middle of the road, good-not-great Irish blended whiskey. There's a sweetness on the nose - buttery croissant filled with vanilla creme patissiere, honey-drizzled apple, frosted cinnamon-y Persian bun doughnut. The palate is also on the sweeter side, opening with buttery pastry, moving into an apple fruitiness and closing with a lingering vanilla glaze quality...so, a bit like eating an apple fritter. Evidently, I have doughnuts on the brain tonight.

It's not going to change your life, but this is an easygoing dram for a casual evening at home. It'll be interesting to see what comes down the road as the distillery begins aging and bottling its own product; there's at least a certain level of taste here in the blending that promises good, if not stellar, things ahead."

3.5,"Colour: light, golden

Nose: sweet with notes of vanilla and banana with some spiciness

Taste: sweet and fruity again, with hints of clove and possibly stone fruits. I found it a bit heavy up front for a whiskey that is 40% but after a few sips found it quite easy to drink

Very similar to the Teeling Small Batch Whiskey, which is not surprising since both have been sourced from the Cooley Distillery."

3.0,"Nose is vanilla, caramel, fruit, oak….the bourbon casks come through so clearly you could in a blind tasting think this this was a bourbon….I can even smell or am tricked into smelling a hint of rye and green apples…but its not a bourbon and the hint of sherry cask point to there is something else going on here…if you can get behind the big robust notes on offer that is. Taste is sweet and super smooth - dominated by caramel and toasted wood. Light spice on the finish stop this being almost like a liquor. The sherry casks bring some nice baked jammy fruits notes to the party but the virgin oak and bourbon casks do dominate the overall presentation. There is no rye to cut through the wood sugars and the spirit is too young to do much else except show off the casks used. On one hand this impressive stuff for a new company with a full and flavoursome nose and a super smooth delivery. On the other hand this is simply lacking in any complexity and falls too heavily on the sweet side of the street for me. In the end nice but simple stuff - lets see where this all leads to for this company. 3 stars or 86"

2.5,"Irish whiskey tasting, The Oak Barrel, Sydney, 7 Feb 2019. Whisky #1

Nose: Floral, sweet toasted cereal, a deep, musky perfume note like candied violets. There’s also a miniscule hint of smoke (or barrel char) and some caramel.

Palate: Soft arrival. Sweet and creamy cereal and malt flavours with a little honey or thinned treacle (maybe butterscotch?). There is hardly any development – what you see at the entry is what you get throughout, but it is pleasant and has a rich texture.

Finish: Medium/short. Sweet cereal aftertaste.

A well-constructed and enjoyable mid-shelf whiskey that is being sourced from Cooley (Slane distillery is in production but has yet to release its own spirit (as at early 2019).

Very easy to drink and fairly priced – quality-wise it could be compared to Johnnie Walker Double Black or Bushmills Black Bush. It has a full, sweet and rounded profile when tasted in isolation but in comparison to better Irish whiskies it shows up as being a little brittle and shallow. Still good value, however.

This is a re-review of this whisky, which was the starter for a tasting of 6. To me it’s better than just average, but I can’t quite bring myself to describe it as “above average”, which is my next rating step, so it stays at 2.5 stars, the score I gave it a year ago.

“Average” 2.5 stars."

4.0,"For the low price (tasted only a few pours from a 50ml bottle) this is a phenomenal price-to-value Irish whiskey, far surpassing Jameson which tastes too charred and harsh for me. The sweetness and some complexity of the multiple barrels gives it a distinctive and sweet character. I also like the Sexton ($30/750 ml in Michigan) far better than Jameson. Jameson seems to be the Budweiser and the Glen Livet of Irish whiskeys: VERY well marketed but generally harsh and unpleasant to drink."

3.75,"I picked up a couple of these(shots) at the local TW for the seasonal review and WOW, this IS NOT your ordinary bland Irish sauce!   

The notes are pleasant warm and sweet spices and the rich red Olorosa speaks up a bit.  Only hints of the standard malts and some nice brown sugars as well are present on the nose.

Off the front the green malt is near and lets you know it's an Irish whiskey after all.  The spicy presence continues through to the end with enough warm bread and spice to actually give it a rye character on the finish.   I like what Slane has done here, it's a traditional base of Irish malt with a goodly amount of interesting variant notes.   The added sweetness makes for a nice spin on a traditional formula and I would give this a recommend for a belated St Paddy's apertife or desert.

3.5,"This Irish blend has thin viscous legs and a light clover honey color.

The nose is soft and has notes of floral sweetness, warm summer rain, strawberry yogurt, dense dark fruit, chocolate, dead leaves, and dry hay.

The palate has a creamy mouthfeel with notes of citrus, cantaloupe and watermelon, red apple, a slight graininess, honey, and white chocolate.

The finish is sweet, of medium length, and leaves one wanting more. In a good way!

I wasn’t expecting to enjoy this whiskey as much as I did, but it actually surprised me! I think this is an Irish whiskey that takes care of your pocket and is more complex than one would first suspect. It probably attributes to the three types of casks it’s aged in. Either way, thanks Slane! I’m a fan! Sláinte!"

Bottled at 40%abv. 

On the nose grain whiskey is detected right away. Cereal, uncooked rice and fresh fields are the most noticeable aromas. 

On the palate it is your typical irish dram.
A Full barley taste, Yeast, Cereal, Chocolate. Aftertaste is very very very smooth. Super cereal flavor, but so pleasant. Well done. 

Overall this dram deserves a 73 over 100. A normal irish whiskey, there are better options, but it was good to have something new from the land of the triple distilled whiskey."
