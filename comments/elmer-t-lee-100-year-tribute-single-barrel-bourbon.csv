5.0,"Nose of cherry, honey, caramel. Viscous on tongue.  So smooth minimal burn.  Lingering taste of fruit, maybe figs?"

4.5,"Whenever I purchase a really hyped Bourbon I always feel that a great equalizer is tasting it against some good competition to see how it fares. Last night I conducted a tasting of this dram vs Rock Hill Farms and the standard Elmer T Lee. Below are the results:

1st Place - ETL 100. It's got a velvety mouth feel with lots of vanilla, toffee and maple syrup notes up front. Then you get berries and some fig notes leading to wood spice/toasted oak driven finish with a dash of cinnamon. It lingers on the tongue. Really well executed. 

2nd Place - Rock Hill Farms (2018 Bottle). Rich butterscotch, toffee and vanilla. Hint of tobacco precedes a medium to long finish that features maple syrup and oak. The oak takes over here and hints at some good age. This is certainly oakier than the Elmer 100. Very good and worth hunting. 

3rd Place - ETL (2019 Bottle) It's a bit thin in comparison to the other two and definitely a much simpler Bourbon. Sweet with lots of vanilla and brown sugar. Orange Peel and slight cinnamon spice with some oak on the finish. Medium to short finish. All in all at or close to retail ($35-$40) it's a nice Bourbon but not worth much over retail. 

Cheers All!"
4.0,Disappointing. Higher proof did not help. Water helps a bit.

4.0,"The color is a vibrant amber that coats the glass without missing a spot. The nose is mild with oak, caramel, brown sugar, rye spiciness and touches of vanilla and citrus. It all comes onto the palate somewhat chewy, with creamy rye coming forward along with cinnamon and pepper, while all the other notes play backup. The finish is medium with the sweeter elements fading away leaving oak and rye to hang on a bit longer. A good bourbon, but lacking in complexity and finish."

3.75,Nose is alcoholy toffee with St. one cotton candy. Maybe some fruit and brown sugar. The tastes is brown sugar/toffee and dark fruit. The ethanol is present in the back palate/throat. There’s also vanilla light baking spice.
4.0,Same Elmer with more oof. Pretty tasty!
