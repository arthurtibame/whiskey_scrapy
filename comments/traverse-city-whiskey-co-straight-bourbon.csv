3.0,"this is a nice find. the nose jumps out sweet and spicy, then settles as it breathes. taste brings a similarity to the nose with spices but they are more subtle, you will also find cinnamon, carmel, and citrus. this is a nicely balanced drink that at a modest price is enjoyable."

3.0,"I enjoyed a dram of this years ago in Phoenix on a sweltering summer night (100 degrees plus), and then saw it on a menu down here in Miami again last weekend.  I recalled liking it, so ordered it again.  I was happy to find that I continued to enjoy this bourbon, and would place it in the top half of independent bourbons that I've experienced.  Its main downside is that it doesn't have the intense punch of flavor that I really look for in a bourbon and has a slightly watery texture that's characteristic of independent brands, which simply cannot afford to age their products as much as the established big-name distilleries.  That being said, the four years that this bourbon spent in the barrel has already resulted in a healthy amount of development.  The nose features a lot of rye spice, vanilla, corn, and a putty-like smell, which is unusual but not off-putting (as an Islay scotch fan, it may even have enhanced the experience for me).  The palate contains a strong orange note, more rye spice, and honey.  The short finish is dominated again by the rye and a sweet-and-sour bite that is characteristic of young bourbons."

5.0,"Incredibly smooth with a tasty, classic bourbon mouth. A great sipper, and one of the better small independent Bourbons I've ever had. I always keep a few bottles handy as this impresses all. I tried this a few years back on a wine tasting trip to Traverse City Mi. Upon drinking some outstanding wine I ended up at the traverse city whiskey co, to grab a quick bite to eat and try something besides wine. So glad I stopped by and tried this gem, the cherry whiskey is pretty tasty as well. I instantly had to buy a bottle. This bourbon is the king of smooth. Thankfully I only get a faint taste of rye spice in the initial sip, the rye does linger through each sip though. On initial sip I get a balanced mouth of caramel, toast, vanilla, honey and butterscotch. At first it ends with a long, smooth finish with some slight heat on the way down. After a few sips It ends with a medium length, layered, clean finish. 
I was simply amazed how well this bourbon was blended at this small whiskey co. Truly a beautiful representation of what a modern Bourbon is and should be."
4.0,"Signature Edition, Barrel Proof. Butterscotch, biscuits, and a little rye spice. Really tasty juice."

3.5,"After the initial punch of ethanol, this bourbon provides a Triple C nose of corn, cedar, and citrus that is pleasant but neither complex nor intriguing. The sip is sweet up front with a crisp, dry mouthfeel that gives just enough of a smooth, oily texture to show that a couple more years in the barrel would make something really special. On the way down, a punch of spice in the back of the throat leads to a smooth, moderate finish with vanilla, caramel, and oak. Go back in for another smell and find raisin, molasses, and apple. It's Michigan autumn in a glass. This bourbon definitely belongs in the category of sipping whiskey but is perhaps only just on the other side of the line from being a cocktail mixer. Overall, a balanced and easy bourbon from a young distillery with a lot of promise."
