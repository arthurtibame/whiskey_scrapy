4.5,"Absolutely delicious! On the nose you get the usual bourbon vanilla, but also notes of molasses, brown sugar, pipe tobacco and maybe a hint of orange peel.  It’s very well balanced between the barrel and the spirit with a very deep rich caramel and spice note. Excellent spirit!"
4.75,Yet another brilliant batch to compare and contrast with those before and the ones to come...
5.0,Still OMG. So much flavor I swear it is like chewing. Heat but not overwhelming. Taste lingers forever. A sipper for sure.
4.5,berries and smoke. slight spicy finish

4.5,The best of the new style bottle batches...and I've had all of them. Sleeper

4.25,"When I first tried this upon immediately opening the bottle, I didn't love it. Tonight's taste, after leaving the 2/3rds full bottle on the shelf for months, is pretty close to perfection.

My first thought is cognac, with hints of chocolate, pancake syrup (not maple), and buttermilk pancakes. It makes me think of that old cereal, French Toast Crunch

Great chewiness on this pour. Like halfway to syrup. I want to just pour this one on my breakfast!"

4.5,I have one top bourbon and one Scotch. This is by far my top bourbon but I must say I do not buy $300 to $1500  bourbons so keep this in mind.
5.0,"My first taste of barrel proof bourbon. Oh boy, what a wonderful drinking experience. This bourbon just exploded in my mouth like a tasty nuclear bomb. It was like a parade of sweet vanilla caramel with a long delightful finish. This eclipsed every whiskey I had tasted and immediately climbed atop my fave whiskies. It is so good that after the first dram I ran out to buy another bottle again. $59 here in Scarsdale NY. 
edit: with 2 drops of water it only enhanced the experience."

4.25,"I see they now have an entry for the B518 so I'm 'duping' this from the generic Barrel Proof entry. Still one of the better bargains out there. Along with Eagle Rare, McKenna's 10 yr BIB, even the Small Batch EC, all are outstanding values which deliver well above their price.

At the price, this is very good. It's what I would reach for when a ""good stiff drink"" is needed. But Bourbons like this I would generally not drink too much of at any one time. Maybe a finger or two...okay, two! I do the same with 3 various Booker's Batches, all very high ABV. The finish will continue to dry your tongue like it's been left out in the Sun at the beach. Drinking it neat, I get two distinct spice burns at different times, one well after the swallow. Definitely agree with @PBMichiganWolverine about the water/ice. That tames this beast and allows for a different experience. Not saying which is the better. Just depends on the mood.

The strength, the burn, the sweet without saccharine, in short, the wonderful bourbon-ness of these liquors allows me to enjoy them without needing too much and also allows me to nurse these suckers 'til the cows come home. 
    
Thanks to the many posters on this whiskey, especially @PBMichiganWolverine for stimulating my curiosity about it."

4.0,"Deep Amber in Color, nose of Cherry and charred oak. Slight vanilla and lots of nutty notes, more pecan.  Flavor is also nutty, with toasted or dark caramel. Peppery long finish. Certainly warming. Lots of tannins. After a few drops of water a floral Aroma found and more nut notes in flavor. More prickly with water."

4.5,"For me, 4 drops of water really opens this bourbon up. Also, months of sitting on the shelf seemed to benefit as well. It is very rich and sweet, but it has that perfect bourbon profile. There's a figginess coated in caramel, syrup, and spice (sometimes even sweet tea - but not that artificial flavor.) The heat actually helps to keep the sweetness from being too much. Best enjoyed in small sips. A fantastic and affordable barrel proof. Looking forward to trying other batches."
4.5,Can't believe this is liquid of 2/3 alcohol.

4.75,"An intense nose. No surprise at 134 proof but a lot of rye on the nose with hints of vanilla and cinnamon as well. 
Same goes for the palate but it has a very chocolatey finish. 
Has some heat but for being this high proof it isn’t much. Delicious"
