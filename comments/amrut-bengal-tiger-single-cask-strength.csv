5.0,"Tried the US Port Cask version. Great stuff with a great peat and sweet balance. Has notes of chocolate, raspberries, peat, and raisins."
4.0,I actually have the US release. Peated single malt matured in port wine pipe. Amazing. Very sweet. Complex. Lingers thick and delicious.

3.0,"NOT BENGAL TIGER! Rather a rare single cask bottling, 4yo, 2009 vintage, finished in PX casks, at a heroic 62.8%, so the most similar listing I could find was the Bengal Tiger bottling. I'll move this if it's true listing appears.

Nose: bold raw oats, sweet apple blossom, dusty oak. Palate: hot and sweet, viscous, spicy wood, hint of minty menthol. Finish: fairly long, freshly sawn boards, bittersweet, quite numbing without astonishing amounts of added water. Two memorable underrated Malts come to mind, the dusty old books of Aberfeldy 12, and the earthy ""je ne sais quoi"" of Jura 10, albeit with a slightly raw edge... Thanks be to the magnanimous Pranay for the sample! Dry glass: faint cardamom?!"
