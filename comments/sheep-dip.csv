2.0,"Nose: Tangy yet smooth, malty and floral fragrant with honey.

Taste: Malt with wee spices and wood.

Finish: Very smooth overall but with some tangy notes.

Balance: Good idea but something falls short in execution. Sheep Dip is too flat without personality."

3.0,Kinda like a girl you've dated before.  Nose has hints of floral notes and fruits.  Very smooth from taste to finish but got kinda of boring real quick...
4.0,"Surprisingly enjoyable for the price...
C: honey
N: VERY pronounced dark chocolate covered cherry
P: Bittersweet chocolate and toffee
F: Pleasantly extended sweet caramel.

Then, after adding 5 drops of water-
N: Praline pecans and toffee
P: Butterscotch
F: Cream and artificial sweetener"

2.0,"Don't let the rather pungent nose throw you, this is a fairly smooth scotch, with hints of spice, wood, and the sea on the palate. It finishes smooth, but relatively quickly too. Not great, but not actively bad either. What would be 3/5 becomes 2/5 due to the price - it's just not worth that much, IMO."

3.0,"[9/6/17] Out here on the company dollar again, figured the risk is pretty minimal. The name drew me in but I probably won't own a bottle. Ever. 

Mild, with no distinction. Sure, its creamy, smooth finishing and soft toffee. The char has a hint of vanilla reminiscent of scratch cask scotch. But this is neither memorable nor a value buy."

4.0,"82 is harsh, man. Real harsh. This is surprisingly good.

It's sweet, with honey and malted barley on the nose. There are also touches of vanilla and fruit on the palate. Body is good, and finish is light and delicate with hints of walnut. 

Give it a try."

3.5,"Tasting in a small snifter.

Color: Mellow gold

Nose: Stewed apple, cinnamon, red grape skin, faint smoke.

Pallet: campfire ash, stewed fruit, cherry, oak, cinnamon, nutmeg

Finish: Light smoke, oak spice, medium length finish.

This is a gem for those who want something with a smoked fruity nose and pallet this is worth picking up."

3.5,Would I get it again... #NO
1.75,"Nose: Wafts of generic fruit, oak, cereal, etc. but it's not very impressive and is remarkably like the nose of a blended scotch.

Palate: The arrival is spicy and sweetish, veering towards heat as it rests in the mouth, and then suddenly blooming with sour harsh malt and bitter coffee. The texture is not noteworthy.

Finish: Short. Fleeting malty notes from the late palate compete with sour grains in the aftertaste.

If you encounter this as part of a blind tasting I guarantee you'll guess it to be a bottom shelf blended scotch.  There is a thin hardness to both the nose and palate and an unwelcome ethanol stain. It is certainly the least characterful or engaging blended malt I've tasted. I'd put it on the same level as Johnnie Walker Red Label (to which it bears something of a resemblance).

Even a small dash of water kills the nose but it does, mercifully, soften the palate a little. It's definitely at its best as a mixer with soft drinks, where (just like blended scotch) the hard finish is balanced by the sweetness of cola, lemonade, ginger ale or what have you. My first inclination was to give this 1.5 stars but I'm raising that to 1.75 based on it's performance as a mixer. However it is neither good value nor worth the official rating of 82. I won't be buying another bottle.

(PS - I have a strong suspicion that this is an opportunistic blend and the formula has some elasticity).

""Adequate"" : 1.75 stars"

3.25,Decent blend. No complaints but at the price ($38) I personally prefer Monkey Shoulder. Glad I gave it a try but probably will not buy again.
3.25,"This is very similar to their blended scotch Pigs nose which is decent. This is better........Poured neat , nose is bready malt, some light apple cinnamon and tea leaves with a bit of barrel and char. Palate is more of the same with sweet malt, oaky dough and char. Maybe a wisp of smoke but more like the fire's been out a long time. Finish is drying malt and char with wood notes that linger. Overall I find it pretty enjoyable. Vatted malt so no grain harshness to deal with. However its a little pricey(for malt blend) at mid to high 30's. Deanston virgin oak is in this profile, tastes better imo and is less$. Still Im not disappointed with Sheep Dip and even give it a recommend score of 83/100...........If you find it for decent price worth a shot if you like malty ""scotchy"" scotch"
3.75,By far the best blended at this price point.
