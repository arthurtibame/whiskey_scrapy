1.75,"Got this bottle for about $13 (88 yuan) from a shop in Guangzhou, China and figured I'd give it a go. I'll say up front, I'm not one of these ""hint of marshmallow"" guys and just know that I smile at the taste of a good drink.  There aren't any tasting notes yet though, so I'll give it a try for ya.
It hits sweet on the tongue (kind of like honey is sweet) then moves into a more mellow sweet (caramel) and has solid oak on the back end as it went down.

At the end of the day though, I've definitely had better.

Recommend heavy on the rocks and lett'em melt."
