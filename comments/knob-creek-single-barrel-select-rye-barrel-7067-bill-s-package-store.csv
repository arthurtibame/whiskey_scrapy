Mouthfeel: a little chewy and astringent, nothing that special

Taste: subtle building into a spicy and oaky burn that challenges without overpowering a smoky and sweet treat 

Finish: medium to long with plenty of heat for a cold night"

5.0,"I have been sitting on this bottle for a while having finally found one locally after over a year of hunting! No it's not technically an allocated or ""rare"" rye, however, I have been able to fairly easily purchase the Knob Rye LE and never seen this one! Untill now!
For background, This is a single barrel offering from Knob Creek of their Rye Whiskey. Like the Bourbon equivalent, it's bottled at near cask strength (115 proof vs the 120 proof for the Bourbon). When Factoring in the actual cask strength rye clocked in at 119 proof, little water would have been added to this one. 
I was also especially excited to have another high proof, well aged Rye for a decent price point ($45). It's especially great given that well aged high proof Kentucky rye is very hard to come by for non ludicrous pricing (Kentucky Owl, Peerless come to mind). Really outside of Pikesville and the Knob LE, you don't really have any High Proof Rye options south of $70.
What separates the Kentucky Ryes from the MGP and Canadian Ryes is the ""barely legal"" Rye mashbill (55% Rye, 35% corn and 10% Malted barley in this case). Most of the MGP and Canadian Ryes are north or 90% rye and thus tend to have more spice and less sweet notes. This particular barrel was barreled on 11/12 and bottled in 5/18 making this one 5.5 yrs old. It was also aged on the 7th floor which would put it at the top level of the warehouse. I am expecting some nice barrel influence. 
On the pallette, it's wonderful. Candied orange, butterscotch, oak, hints of leather with clove and black pepper undertones. Mid pallette brings nuts, cocoa nibs and more oak with clove now more noticeable. The finish is long and oak and nut driven with sweet mint tingle on your tongue. 
Honestly, I am blown away. Firstly, I don't know who is in charge of the Knob Creek LE selection, but they need help. Between the Rye and Bourbon LE I have sampled, these store picks are just always better. They clearly have the barrels, they just aren't picking them!
I am also happy that Kentucky can help me get over the Templeton Cask Rye release (see my review for background) and that the good guys win on value and quality! This one beats that one too. 
In short, I have tasted a lot of Ryes, and this one has it all. Value, complexity, proof and mouthfeel. For $45, it's really unbelievable. 
If you see one, do yourself a favor and buy it. I will be going back and picking up a couple more.
Cheers all!"

4.0,Neat. Uncorked store pick.  Need to try it again.  Did a blind test taste against Old Forrester Rye so no tasting notes.  The OF was way ahead on flavor and even bite. I was confident I like the Knob better until the reveal.  It was still really good but a more standard Rye profile compared to OF.

3.75,"This is Single Barrel store pick - 115 proof - Kentucky Straight Rye Whiskey.

N:  Seasoned oak, rye bread, spearmint, vanilla, cinnamon, butterscotch, teaberry.

P:  Spearmint, teaberry, light vanilla, butterscotch, faint dill.

F:  Oak and nutmeg, mint morphs into black pepper.

The nose is fairly busy and powerful, as you would expect with that high of a Proof.  On the palate, an initial alcohol bite gives way to that of chewing sticks of spearmint and teaberry gum at the same time with a little dill, vanilla, and butterscotch on the side.  It’s heavy on the mint overall, but that’s not really surprising.  A decent rye all-in-all."

4.0,"Solid stuff! Was taken back by it's ability to hold it's own against other formidable Ryes out there. Found 4 on shelf and proceeded to buy 2 here in San Diego at a local Beverage chain, took a chance, knew if I went back for another they would be gone regardless if it was good or not. No buyer remorse here whatsoever, hits fairly strong at first on all notes with palate as well as finish, but tapers real fast to zero, not chewy at all, but thats ok, bang for the buck this stuff delivers!"

4.25,"Aged 6-8 years. Mash Bill: 55% Rye, 35% Corn, and 10% Malt. (Beam Suntory). 2018 single barrel sounds like it has a higher than average age (perhaps 6-8 years)."

5.0,Much better than the everyday KC rye. 115 proof... spicy and delicious. Don’t pass on it if you can buy a bottle.
4.5,"Ok...this stuff is amazing. I did side by side with Rendezvous, Whistle Pig 12, and Kentucky owl rye. This held its own.  Stood right there with the big boys. Has a little more sweetness from a higher corn content than Whistle Pig and Kentucky Owl, but not like a total b li end like Bourye. Just really really good. At $65/bottle when many great ryes are pushing twice that, a great score."
4.0,Spicy. Cinnamon and aged fruit aftertaste. Add a cube

4.5,"I'm sadly tardy in getting my Knob Creek Single Barrel Rye review in, and the story behind it may be a familiar if also sad one. 

 I acquired said bottle in a ""store deal""  the kind were you have to acquire a certain bottle to get another certain bottle.  I consider it a fairly unscrupulous if common practice among liquor store owners who don't mind displaying their lack of moral character.   These guys are out to make an extra buck any way possible and being giant gaping aholes is entirely in character for them.   Occasionally the plots of these cretins happens to backfire on them though,  and this may be one such case.  
The Knob Barrel Rye was only in the 45$ US range and to me that pretty much makes it something of a bargain, a bargain I can assure you this particular liquor store owner was NOT intending to make it as he is well known for his shoddy practices.    The fact I got a nice bottle of Knob Rye in a deal to get a bottle of Weller Antique 107 which was only moderately overpriced might mean I got the last laugh after all.  Ah well, we can remember karma can be a bee itch and these shady dealers are not immune.  

Borrowing from Dubz480's well stated descriptors, the Knob Barrel Rye brings: ""Candied orange, butterscotch, oak, hints of leather with clove and black pepper undertones. Mid pallette brings nuts, cocoa nibs and more oak with clove now more noticeable.""

I get all that, some minor red hot cinnamon's and a bit of citric sting as well, the finish is superb tapering off with much of the interesting notes and little else to distract from what a great dram you are imbibing.  This is another one of those reminders that less cutting(higher proof) generally means more flavor and I found the Knob Barrel Rye to be a generously flavored experience that any rye drinker should really appreciate. 

For some reason the shenanigans with the liquor store put me off my game in getting my review in, but just the same,  alls well as ends well and now I'm wishing I had got in on this ""deal"" for a second time.  Cheers!"

Nose: spice, honey, orange peel

2.0,"Store pick - so buyer beware.

Nose - I don't like rye, lol. OK joking aside, this is a harder profile to note. I get those traditional bourbon vanilla and oak notes, but there's a rye note I don't really know how to articulate. It's spicy and sharp but it's pretty nice more bourbon forward rye.  Maybe some brown sugar and I dunno some kinda sweet syrup. 

Taste - There's oak, mint, caramel, rye spice, and really that's it. It's a pretty oak driven flavor. Maybe some butter scotch. 

I'm a solid 2.0 here. It's average. It's an enjoyable rye whisky. I wouldn't buy it again but I only bought it for the right to get the weller full proof. But it won't got to waste. This might become my starter whisky or the one I pour when I've had a couple and just want to sip and not think."

4.0,"Store pick from Liquor Express in Tempe, AZ. 

On the nose getting a lot of banana and clove; reminiscent of a good Hefeweizen beer. Delving deeper we find dill, cooking herbs (sage? thyme?), movie theater butter, and snickerdoodle cookie. The level of ethanol in the nose is zero; something I wasn't sure possible at 115 proof so definitely extra points for that. 

On the palate, opens with rich liquid snickerdoodle, followed by a nice slow transition to a slightly herbal mid-palate, leading to a long and peppery finish. The sticky sweetness remains present underneath as it changes, making for a nice smooth ride instead of a jarring turn. I dig the journey. 

Mouthfeel is slick and buttery. Fits the flavor and proof perfectly. 

A definite winner. At $50, I feel I got what I paid for. The sweetness makes it more of a bourbon lovers rye. Those looking for a dill bomb or herb garden might want to look elsewhere. My area seems to be swimming in store picks for this expression so eager to try some other picks."

4.5,"750 ml 6 year old batch bottle from LeNell’s Beverage Boutique.  Nice peppery strong nose.  Front of the palate is nice and hot at 115 proof, but it has a very nice quick fade down to a delicious finish."

4.25,Roger Wilco barrel. Really nice rye
4.25,"Nose: Herbaceous and vegetal, thyme, basil and green bell peppers.  Dill, nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla - classic rye notes, though not as much dill as you'd think.  Charred oak.  Sugar.  Tart apples.  Leather.  This definitely is a rye, but the smell is dryer than many others I've had.  Leans into some unique territory.

Palate: Brown sugar, black pepper, tea, cinnamon candy (think Red Hots).  Medium-low tannin, barrel bitter.  The herbaceous and vegetal notes from the nose show up, but are behind this dusty, almost dry veil.  The mouthfeel is effervescent.  Solid evolution up to and through the finish where the barrel bitter sticks around and the rest of the flavors slowly disappear from the base on up - there's the green bell pepper, dried basil, thyme, and oregano.

Other notes: This is from barrel #7408 by and for BevMo.  This is definitely something different.  I wouldn't suggest this to somebody as being indicative of what you want from a rye, but if you're familiar with the style this might be an interesting break from the norm.  It definitely drinks ""hot"" but that's never been a bad thing in my opinion.  Just another sensation to play with.  I thoroughly enjoy this and am glad to add it to my collection."

4.25,"From an unassuming Kroger barrel pick in lexington KY.

Rich amber color.  Quick legs for the proof (115 per the label).  

The nose is warm caramel-vanilla with toasted oak and slight trashed hazelnut.  Undoubtedly some ethanol but not overpowering.

Spice and maple sweetness hit the tongue and tingle.  Definitely warms the chest.  Nosing it a second time brings out candies fruit.  The second sip is equally spicy and sweet.  Being a rye the spice is no surprise but definitely shows up on the palate more than the nose.  The lingering finish reminds me of caramel covered apples and puts a smile on my face.

For an impulse buy I would say this one was excellent for the price.  Not overly complex but very satisfying for my taste.  A second bottle may be in my future."

4.0,"Taste:  This is Binny's select #8094.  Warehouse #1, Floor 6, Rick 20.  Barreled on 10/15/12, selected 5/24/2019.  NAS but thought to be 6 yrs. 5 mos by the math at 115 proof.  2 oz, Glen cairn neat, then 2 drops.

Nose:  (4.0)  Toasty buttered rye bread.  There is some oakiness here as well.  Caramel lies in the background to keep you guessing.  Ethanol is on the nose with the slightest hint of vanilla bean.  I like traditional rye, and this one calls to me.

Palate: (4.0) Sweeter than the nose hints at.  Think Baker's here.  Baking spices dominate with a cereal bar-grain backing that up.  There is some bitterness that is easily tempered by a drop or two.  That comes on towards the end, so I address it here but could have in the finish.

Finish: (4.0)  Long, brawny and buttery.  It lingers with a nice baking spice kick.  A bit tannic, but rye lovers will dig that.  Bourbon lovers will find the finish the reason they prefer bourbon and not rye.  

Overall:  A well done and traditional rye.  It has no regrets and does not try one bit to disguise what it is-- well aged, straight up, no frills, kick you in the taste buds rye!  My comparison is the #2 Cask strength which was exceptional.  This is a definate ""get a bottle"" of this offering.  Cheers!"

4.5,"I’ve been slowly going through this bottle over the last 3 months and have been enjoying the heck out of it. Leuken’s store pick barrel #5948. If I recall I picked it up for $40 so to me it was a no-brainer. These knob Creek store picks are a bargain when available. 

Taste is a wonderful rye spice on the tongue that lingers just long enough to make it feel like you just consumed a cinnamon altoid. Nice spicy burn in a way that only a good rye can manage to do. The 115 proof is masked very well by the spice, certainly doesn’t feel like 115 proof. 

I’ve been moving away from the straight ryes and been employing them in manhattans and old fashioned’s except for this bottle which I keep to remind me how a good rye should taste when alone. 

I’ll certainly be milking this one as long as I can.

Gordon's Private Barrel Selection

Color is ruddy copper. Nose is like Sunday brunch, with cinnamon and brown sugar, maple syrup on waffles, a soft vanilla like condensed milk, and a gentle rye spice in the background with something like bubblegum. Lots of heat on the palate, rye spice comes to the forefront, accompanied by more baking spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger), and charred oak. Less sweetness on the palate, but hints of vanilla, caramel and cherry cola. Full bodied but somewhat dry mouthfeel. Long, hot, dry finish with lots of charred oak. More baking spices and a light sweetness like a drizzle of honey on toasted rye bread. This is an amazing rye, and top notch barrel pick."
