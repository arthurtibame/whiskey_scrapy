    Taste: The first jolt is an intense peaty sweetness and then the sharp alc. comes, followed by copper, like it literally knocked a tooth out. Enjoyable, but I miss depth, must investigate further."

5.0,"This came courtesy of @Generously_Paul. I was hesitant on trying it because I really disliked the 7.3, but this is a completely different beast, all to its own. Brown sugar was the first note on the nose I got, along with maple syrup, and more spicy than sweet though. Cinnamon, nutmeg, candied bacon, and kielbasa come to mind also. Palate is also fantastic, with mouthwatering peat, deep ruby fruits, barbecue, and steak. Sounds like a damn good dinner to me! It has a really long finish married will with savory and sweet notes as well. Water adds some maritime characteristics as well. Extremely well done Bruichladdich! Only more age (this is about a 5 year) would maybe help this one, but it doesn't need it. 4.75! This one is lovely, complex, and deserves your time. The theme of this dram needs to scream summer... ""She Bangs the Drums"" by The Stone Roses will do."
4.0,"Age: 5 years old
Alcohol: 58.5%
Maturation: Ex-Bourbon cask with finishing in ex-French Syrah casks from Rhone Valley
Paid: $182 (Travel retail exclusive)

This is the only x.2 Octomore I have tried and, as is the rule with travel retail exclusives, it is disappointing.  The consolation prize is that it’s still an enjoyable whisky, but not for $182.

Red wine and volcanic ash is a strange combination.  The explorations of peat and red wine by Springbank, with their Longrow Red series are more to my liking because they show me that wine is missing more alcohol and some peat.  Octomore 7.2 looks at things from the other way around: Is a peat monster missing some wine?  No.  This is not an improvement over the x.1s.  The cheapest and easiest to find Octomore in my area is the 6.1, and it is much better without the wine influence.

Some water is mandatory with this 7.2, otherwise you get this awkward ash polluted with Syrah.  Even with water, it just brings out the buttery and savory goodness that the basic 6.1 and 7.1 already has in abundance.  The arrival is surprisingly delicate for the high ABV, but this one also finishes bitterer compared to the x.1s.

MARK: 88/100.
Not recommended.  If you want to spend money on an Octomore, try x.1 and x.3s."

4.0,"I found this sample hiding behind several knickknacks on the top of my refrigerator.  It’s an old sample sent to me from my buddy @Generously_Paul, in what was probably a trade from over a year ago.  It’s been even longer since I had a bottle of the Octomore 7.1.  I guess it’s long passed time to get into this one, so let’s do this...

The Octomore 7.2 is a 5 year old, heavily peated whisky from Bruichladdich.  This series was also the last one done by master distiller Jim McEwan took part in- so, he made sure it was the most heavily peated ever:  208ppm.  7.2 was a blend of whisky aged in ex-American oak and French Shiraz wine casks.  It’s bottled at 58.5% and I believe the bottle ran just shy of $200.  This one was also considered a travel retail edition- so it was more limited.

It’s a dull yellow in the taster with very oily and thin legs.  Tiny droplets also form after a rigorous spin.  The nose is typical Octomore:  ashy peat and BBQ smoke with a side of salted fish.  Tar and a slight band aid note add a special funk I don’t recall from any other Octomore I’ve tried (although it’s been awhile since I’ve had one and I’ve killed millions of brain cells since then, lol).  The typical Shiraz wine notes aren’t apparent on the nose:  I’m missing the grape must, tannins and dark chocolate- the peat is just too strong.

The palate is deeply rich and full of peat and salty, sea air.  The BBQ flavors are what’s subdued with this one.  I did pick up some dark chocolate notes after adding a spritz of water to the sample, but it also brought forward some citrus notes instead of the wine fruitiness I was expecting.  The mouthfeel is still luscious and somewhat heavy, but this is Octomore so that’s to be expected.  There’s not much heat from the ridiculously high ABV, but we all know why that is, too.  The finish is longer and spicier than I remember from other Octomores, but I do like that aspect.  Scratch that- I LOVE that part.  As the smoke and earthy peat tang fades it turns drier, but there still isn’t enough wine fruits to indicate the Shiraz casking.  It’s not a bummer, just an observation.

Ultimately, this is still a wonderful dram.  I love the constant attack from the peat and salt and the richness just hangs there trying to make you whimper.  The absence of heat is slightly scary, as I could keep filling the Glencairn if I had the bottle in front of me.  It’s not better, and if I’m honest, not much different from what my notes about the 7.1 indicate- so, there’s no real reason to chase the exclusivity of this one over the 7.1.  It still doesn’t live up to the Series 6, but I also wouldn’t toss this bottle out.  3.75-4 stars, maybe stretching to 4.25 when I’m in an Octomore frame of mind.  If Bruichladdich keeps making these, I’ll keep trying them.  Cheers.

3.25,"Interesting, but overall, it seems to me as an experiment more than a finished scotch...
I imagine that these elements could be incorporated into others,
Nose campfire smoke and bacon
Palate very Peaty, smooth, and of course very smoky, and good body.
Nice long finish
However, the price is too high

I dig Octomore.  Some consider them a gimmick.  You really have to taste the good ones blind to understand that this is not a gimmick.  Age statement does not equal maturity statement, and I could easily mistake the best Octomores for a 20-something year old Islay whisky.

Unfortunately, 7.2 is not one of the better Octomores I've tasted.  The Syrah wine finish adds some acidity, which when combined with the huge salty and smoky notes, reminds me of salted fish that has sat out in the sun for a whole day, and you are questioning whether or not you should eat it.  The finishing actually makes the 7.2 taste younger than the 7.1; there are some extra metallic notes that I do not appreciate.

This is nonetheless a good whisky.  As with all Octomores, there's a huge farm funk, and thick black ash.  The first word that comes to mind is ""fracking.""  But for ~$200, there are better Octomores.

4.0,"Drinking this alongside the 07.1, and can say quite definitively that I prefer the other one to this. 
Nose is a bit rough...a not-quite-matured-enough blend of red wine and smoke. Smokier than the 7.1 on the nose for me, but the drawback is the awkward combination at play. It mellows with time but not enough.
On the palate, its improved as the smoke takes center stage and the whisky somehow remains immensely drinkable neat despite its 208 ppm and cask strength ABV. The wine makes a bit more sense now, and leaves its mark with sticky sweetness at the end similar to a very dry Syrah. The finish isn't as refined as the 7.1 either, as it bows out rather quickly in comparison and leaves that sticky wine residue as opposed to lingering smoke.
It's hardly bad...in fact its one you might drink to punish your palate a bit. My search for the best Octomore continues!"

5.0,"Thanks to @Generously_Paul , I got to try this smoking beauty.  Such a perfect whisky to have when temperatures are like what we have here in the northeast currently, in the sub-0 category.  The nose isn't much to speak of, quite light and faintly citrusy, but wow...really hits you in the palette.  If you've ever been to Amsterdam, they have these little eels that are finely smoked, topped with sea salt, and a touch of lemon...that's what this taste like.  Just a briny, smoky, yet sweet citrusy flavor.  Probbaly the best Octomore I've had to date.  Thanks Paul"

3.5,"Nose: Nosing it neat the first thing I noticed was a big oily, herby, smoky cloud of peat. No surprises there. After the first wave of smoke I got honey notes, a touch of citrus fruit, and faint spices (caraway, cardamom, fennel and anise). A distant rubbery note as well. It produces a wall of further smoky, peaty aromas when diluted.

Palate: Tasted neat there is a surprisingly soft and fruity arrival that is then borne aloft on a cushion of smoky peat the size of Islay itself. A rich, sweet character with hints of berries, oranges and honey. Also a little lemony citrus. Surprisingly, it's a fairly simple palate that is dominated by this handful of powerful flavours. The texture is pleasantly oily, which balances the drying nature of the strong alcohol content well, but it is still hot on the tongue and it all seems curiously tight and hard to access. That's not an unusual thing with high-proof whisky, but this one seems particularly restrained.

Finish: Predictably long, fruity and spicy. The sweet smoke reasserts itself and eventually fades as the final note. It's only after a while that you realize how smoky and peaty this really is.

A pleasant enough experience but while there are some nice moments it's far from being the best Octomore I've tasted.

For a big hefty bruiser of a whisky it’s prissy about getting its toes wet. It needs water in order to bloom and release all the locked up berry and grape flavours and aromas, but it is very fussy about dilution. If you get the amount of water perfect it suddenly springs to life and there is a flood of fruity goodness to enjoy, however if you add just one drop too much it just as suddenly turns flat, dusty, and dull. It’s worth tasting for the experience, but I wouldn’t recommend buying a whole bottle.

“Good” : 3.5 stars"
4.0,"I decided to do a side by side Octomore review tonight between the 07.1 and 07.2 to follow up the 07.3 review I did a couple days ago. 
First up is the 07.2

Bottled at 58.5% ABV, non chill filtered, and a natural color of golden amber, this 5 year old Islay malt boasts a staggering 208 ppm. It is aged in a combination of ex bourbon American oak casks and European oak casks that once held French Shiraz/Syrah wine. This expression is a travel retail exclusive that I picked up at the US-Canadian border. 

The nose has beautiful peat smoke. Not an oppressive, smothering smoke, but a lighter more manageable smoke. Heather honey, red berries and hints of sweet red wine. Red grapes, cereal malt and hints of maraschino cherries. It’s quite sweet, but definitely on the lighter side. More fruits like peach, apricot, pear and a touch of spearmint. Definitely shows its youth   

The palate is full of peppery peat smoke. Sweet, red wine and grapes, berries. Light oak, cherries, and honey. Some bonfire ashes and it has a slightly medicinal Laphroaig type note. 

Medium bodied mouthfeel with a light oiliness that turns slightly dry. 
A medium long finish with red fruits and smoky lemons. 

The extra fruity notes introduced by the wine casks added a nice layer of depth, but like the 07.3, it shows its youth and overall lack of real complexity. On the plus side, it’s very drinkable despite its high ABV. You only need a little to make your night.  4.25
Cheers"
3.5,"My greatest disappointment, not worthy of 150£. Very introvertic whisky, even with some water the nose and taste are modest. The peatiness despite of 208 ppm is hardly felt. Common Caol Ila 12 y.o. gave me more pleasure."

4.0,"Nose- Herbal/ vegetal note, black sharpie, sweet honey, peat smoke, sea salt

Palate- Malty barnyard notes initially, wave of peat smoke, wood spice, sour berries, ashes

Finish- Long, viscous finish with notes of heavy peat, sour berries, and sweet honey

This is interesting. Not nearly as good as the 10 year Octomore that I’ve tried, but still good nonetheless. Surprisingly not much peat on the nose. I’m getting mainly earthy barnyard and herbal notes, with an odd smell of a black sharpie. The palate, on the other hand, is filled with peat smoke. Notes of honey and sour berries balance the smoke out, but I can’t get past this black sharpie note. The finish is a good one, with the sharpie drifting away, and giving way to peat smoke, sour berries, and honey."
4.5,"My favourite of the 7 series Ocomore. The .2 is usually a wine cask finish and this one, finished in a Syrah cask, was my favourite. Hard to come by in Australia as it was a Duty Free exclusive but I've now managed to procure 3 bottles and I want more!
One must be patient with this one as it needs air to show its full charatcer. Apart from the Brine, one gets smoked fish, choc fudge, burnt orange peel, licorice & barley sugar on the nose.  It's a massive nose backed up by a palate that reciprocates it on the tongue. Dangerously complex with honey (beeswax), agave (yes mezcal), licorice bullets and the always present peat.  The finish is almost bourbonesque with cherry, vanilla and chocolate but it's never too sweet. The balance with the peat makes sure of this.  I love this whiskey and I wish the Dialogos  range could be half as good.  The 8.2 came close but I'm afraid we will never see Octomores as good as the Commus, 5.1, 6.3, 7.1, 7.2, 8.2 & 10yr old 2nd edition ever again.  It's a shame really as the base whisky will always be good but it lacks one crutial ingredient..... Jim McEwan."
