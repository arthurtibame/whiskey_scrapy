5.0,"I normally don’t go for a corn whiskey, but when I found this one, it changed my mind about this type. 100% Blue Corn Grown And Cracked By The Natives Of Tuwac Colorado Rectified And Matured In American Oak. Who knows more about corn than our native Americans!  Made by a craft distillery in Fairplay, CO. The Snitching Lady Distillery"
