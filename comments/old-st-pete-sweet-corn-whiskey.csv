3.0,"Has the strong corn aroma flavor you'd expect. I picked up vanilla on the finish. A balanced attack, and then more vanilla on the finish."

4.0,"Not too bad. A 3.8, not quite a 4 star rating. Has a unique, but not unpleasant, mid palate note that I assume comes from the sweet corn. Well done for a Florida distillery"

4.5,"Young craft Florida fun! I don't know if I love the whiskey or not but it is so much fun to try whiskey from different places. Growing up in central Florida this whiskey holds a special place in my heart and the empty bottle is what I use as my infinity bottle. The nose is four distinct notes: corn grain dustiness, a corn sugary sweetness, a thin oak spice, and an oyster cracker breadiness. The taste is all corn sweetness with that oyster cracker breadiness and a thin oak spice finish. It is light and delicate for enjoying a glass once in a while. The whiskey gets better as it sits in the bottle 
 or opens up in the glass."

3.0,Sweet caramel and apple with hints of corn on the nose. Strong pear and some oak flavors predominated with a medium finish of sweet polenta. Flavors were a bit sharp.
3.5,It is definitely on the sweeter side. Has a bit of a bold after taste to it. Tastes old and oaky. Does not pair well with soda. On the rocks or a splash of ginger ale.

3.0,Sweet corn nails this taste. Different in its own way. Very sweet with corn and light vanilla taste and maybe some spices? Enjoyed a glass neat. Overall enjoyed.
3.0,It’s ok. Smells and tastes like corn dust and sweet fruits.

3.0,Certainly tastes like a new whiskey. Right after tasting Pikesville this tastes like it was right out of a brand new oak barrel. Not a bad thing but you can certainly taste the fresh wood flavor. Not sure if I’d revisit this one if it weren’t local. Certainly a good spirit though.
