2.0,"As a huge fan of whisky, i am a lover of proofs and barrels (some more than others) yet Redemption missed the mark - but then again it did. Let me explain. 

This whisky has a proof of 84 (42 abv) and isn’t at all that complex. 

Most whiskeys in my humble opinion should make you sit back and think about whats happening on the tongue, nose, inner cheek and down the hatch. As an entry level whisky i would recommend this solely on the description of “a smooth, well balanced and slightly spicy bourbon...”. The positive of this bourbon is that it is really smooth, theres no bite and slight spice that lingers on the front of the tongue. You really have to swish this around in the mouth and more specifically, under the back of the tongue to really draw out more of this drams profile. When doing so, you don’t get the best bang for your buck as this whisky is $40-$50 and doesn’t have much else to offer besides a hefty price tag. 

It also has a sour mash profile mix. Most people associate sour mash with the classic , staple of Jack Daniel’s old No. 7. This has a different mash taste in comparison which is nice.  Not as in your face (more so, nose in this instance) which is pleasant change. 

100% entry level for the kiddies pre drinking for the high school dance, not for the cats who enjoy a good bite after a long day at the office. 

Cheers,"

3.0,"Nose- Lots of sweet vanilla and doughy bread notes. 
Body- This is a fairly simple pour but overall it is sweet and soft with vanilla, honeysuckle and sugar cookies. 
Finish- Vanilla continues giving way to a bit of mint. There is a bitter oakiness in the finish that takes away from the soft mid palate. 

While unremarkable. This is a nice bourbon all around. The relatively low Distiller ranking surprised me."
2.5,"Not happy with this one. Worth no more than $22. I paid $25. Don’t think I’ll buy it again. Batch 27 on the bottle. 

Update: tried this in an old fashioned, rocks, neat. It’s still garbage."

2.5,"Appearance: This MGP bourbon was a light caramel syrup color. It also had thick semi-watery legs that jogged their way down my Glencairn’s interior.

Nose: The nose possessed notes of strong ethanol at first, followed by classic caramel and vanilla, cherry, honey, and dry grass and leaves.

Taste: The palate had a watery mouthfeel and some barrel bite, with notes of caramel, vanilla, and a weird sour note, but overall it was pretty boring.

Finish: The finish was bitter with tannins and long with a light burning on the back of the throat.

Thoughts: So this is our well bourbon at the cocktail bar I work at, and the cocktails made with this whiskey are great, however, drank neat, this isn’t really all that special, though I’m happy I tried it. It has basically just the typical bourbon notes, but even those aren’t great. As a mixer it’s great, but there are better whiskeys out there. Thanks MGP. Cheers!"

3.5,"Originally reviewed for The Whisky Tribe (lazy copy pasta of my own review)
Texas sure makes a magnificent bourbon. 
This being from Indiana, the Redemption is pretty close to an Eleanor but still has that new make sweetness ontop of the “Eleanor walnut” note. 
On the palate, it’s buttery at first then a nice blend of young whiskey tastes and mild barrel spice follows. The buttery note lingers slightly, the new make sweetness sours, then it and the spice notes slowly ramp up and just reside on the tongue and roof of the mouth. 
I enjoy it but I think it’s because I’m thinking of another, lady Eleanor. 
The Redemption says no less than 2 years in the barrel and the Eleanor most on my mind was 37 months so I assume that’s close enough for a good comparison, though Eleanor probably had more time in the barrel. This wasn’t as high a proof as Eleanor either but with the prominence of the new make notes I don’t think a higher proof would help. 
Wish the rando liquor store I popped into didn’t mark it up as high as they did but it’s doing its job perfectly so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

2.25,"Smell: bright sweetness.  Brittle.  Sugar.  Faint orange.

Palate: thin and watery.  Corn sweetness. Slight vanilla.  Simple.  Boring.

This is not one of my favorites.  Definitely not on the ""buy again"" list."
4.0,Slightly peaty with a touch of sweet.  Smooth finish.  Good price point:
3.5,Very pleasant. I get a very balanced flavor profile of vanilla oak and toasted grain. Rich caramel nose. It has a bit of a lingering after taste. I’m enjoying this straight up but I’m sure it’ll just as good over ice.
3.75,"Spicy; pepper, nutmeg. Vanilla cream. Caramel chew. So smooth."
