3.75,Good flavor! great with a cigar
2.25,"Got a bottle for poppa for his birthday and he wasn’t impressed. He let me have it back and I’m aging it in my oak barrel to ease the bite. 

I’m not all that impressed either. Lots of burn and not great flavors, at least to my pallet. 

I tried the boss hog a few years ago and it blew me away so I assumed this would be up there with it, I assumed wrong."

4.0,"3rd bottle of my Christmas whiskey share ($80ish bottles).

Nose is warm buttery spices, caramel, vanilla, and an acetone note.

Taste is sour grain, grass, heavy spices, and leather.

Finish is long and fairly hot but enjoyable.

Great rye whiskey."
4.5,Personally my favorite Whiskey. Bring on that spicey Rye!
