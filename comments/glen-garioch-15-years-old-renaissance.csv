4.25,"Nose - (w/o water) Bright floral, lightly tropical, dark apples/pear, starfruit, lightly ""meaty"" vibe, oaked chardonnay (w/ water) Opens up more, more light tropical fruits, less meaty, dark muscat grapes

Taste - (w/o water) Fruity spicy ginger, sweet apple/muscat grapes, floral thinned honey, more floral orchard fruits (w/ water) Filtered apple cider, muscat grapes, floral honey, hint of fruity spice

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering candied ginger tingle, sweet muscat grapes, grape gummies (w/ water) Lingering fruity tingle, residual muscat sweet, hint of of oaked chardonnay

Score - 86/100

Final Thoughts - This was quite a tasty dram. I quite liked the tropical vibe I got from it. The ""meaty"" nature was present without water but mostly went away with a bit of water. I like how this has this nice dark amber muscat grape vibe to it that's quite nice, but at the same time lends itself to be a bit on the sweet side for me. I think it's best with a tiny bit of water to really open it up and balance out the sweetness a bit.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - Maybe"

4.0,"I really enjoyed this whisky. For me it had notes of biscuits, defintely sherry, though not a sherry bomb. I like the heavily sherried whiskies ( e.g. GlenDronach and Aberlour), but with the Glen Garioch the sherry was more subtle and went well with the biscuit yeast taste. I would recommend sharing this with a friend, or somone you hope will become more than a friend. It is a flavourful relaxing dram, not overly complex and not boring. I guess that makes it baby bear."

Peppery taste. Add a dash of water to enhance the flavours.
