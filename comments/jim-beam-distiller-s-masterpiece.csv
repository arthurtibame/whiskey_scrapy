3.0,"Ce bourbon est excellent, bien balancé. Mais en vaut-il le cout? Oui , mais seulement à cause de l'emballage , sans plus. Achetez-vous le single barrel à la place....... Je trouve dommage à dire mais...... Je le trouve meilleur. Par contre, si vous voulez faire découvrir le bourbon à quelqu'un, ces une bonne façons de lui faire aimer...... et d'épater la galerie."

4.0,Good overall. Little bit of a bite. I like it.
4.0,"Not sure what Ximenez sherry smells like, but there is a unique smell to this. A bit briny as well. Familiar Beam profile, but yet, different. Great heat, good sweetness, pleasant spice. Very smooth for the proof, but still a good flavor kick.  Nutty and slightly fruity, dark fruits. 6/13/17"

4.0,"A PX finished bourbon...wwhaaaaatt!?

Yes this NAS Jim Beam took ""extra aged"" bourbon and finished it in Pedro Ximenez sherry casks. It clocks in at 50% ABV, or 100 proof for you bourbon lovers, is a natural color of what I would call rust, and I have no word on if it is chill filtered or not. 

The nose give a big blast of sherry sweetness up front with a noticeable hit of alcohol if you are too eager and don't let it settle down for a few minutes first. Dark dried sherry fruits and a corn sweetness. Cotton candy (first time I ever really picked up cotton candy before). There is some rye hiding in the background. Something like maple or maybe slightly burnt caramel. Low levels of vanilla show up with time. Very interesting to nose. 

That palate is equally interesting. A touch hot on the first sip, but you get used to it pretty fast. Sweet syrup and sherried American oak in spades. Cinnamon and clove. If you really swish it around your mouth the base bourbon notes really come forward in a big way. 

Somewhat oily mouthfeel and it's slightly mouthwatering.  A fairly long finish. Dry with caramel, dark sherried fruits, oak and some lingering heat. 

This was difficult to figure out early on due to the very different profiles at work. Bourbon and sherry are not two styles I would think to put together but it works. I feel like a better quality bourbon like an Elijah Craig or an Evan Williams would have really shined with a PX finish, or even an Oloroso finish. I know lots of people swear by JB but it's not my cup of tea. Still this was damn good. Not $200 good, which makes me glad I was able to get a 1oz sample from Lee, who In turn got it from someone else I believe. 4.25 all the way"

4.0,"Nose - Strong oaky vanilla, light caramel sweet, hint of roasted peanuts, lightly waxy, faint dark cherry twizzlers in the background.

Taste - Sweet dark luxardo cherry sweet makes a strong appearance on the palate, cinnamon spice & heat, caramelized vanilla sugar, oak, creamy vanilla latte foam sweetness.

Finish - Lingering cinnamon spice heat, oaky, light bitter, sweet dried cherry sweet, faint bitter peanut shell/skins appear again.

Score - 84/100

Final Thoughts - I struggled to get any PX influence on this one in the nose & apparently all it took was a single sip to maybe break the surface tension or something? It was very weak on the nose and ""different"" on the palate. It seemed very one dimensional sweet of luxardo cherry versus dark fruits and chocolate like I usually get from sherry finished whiskies. To me this tasted like they just took their bonded bourbon, finished it briefly in px sherry, bottled it in a fancy bottle, & sold it in a fancy box for a significant markup. I will admit the extra finishing helps neutralize the peanuty notes I typically get from Beam stuff, but didn't completely get rid of it. This wasn't a bad dram by any means, and of course I wouldn't turn it down if offered, but I don't think this is something I'd want to spend my money on getting an entire bottle of."

4.0,"Nose is butterscotch, wine, with some raisin and menthol

Palate is rich and creamy mouthfeel with allspice, smoke, cinnamon, spice and cigar box on the plate wary. As it opens you get more maple and nutty flavors with and herbal undertone 

Cheryl on the very pleasant finish"

4.0,"This review was transferred from the Barreled app.  I also tried this again at Whiskyfest DC on 4/17/18.  I added an update at the end of my original review:


Let's face it, Jim Beam is the Budweiser of bourbons.  

If you forget that simple analogy, forget the high price point and take this bourbon on its own merits you'll get a delicious, sweet Scotch-like whiskey that puts a big, ole smile on your face.  The presence of rye and the fact it's 100 proof assures you its bourbon, but the Pedro Ximemez sherry casks add an amazing dimension that takes it from boring Budweiser to a brilliant craft brew.

Spend the money and give it a try.  It won't disappoint you.

UPDATE from 4/17/18:

I was able to give this another try at Whiskyfest and still found it delightful.  There was a more pronounced bit of oak cask at play than I recall.  It makes sure you don’t forget you’re drinking a Beam product.  The sherry cask notes calm the rye level perfectly.  It’s a 4.25-4.5 star dram, but I should adjust my opinion and say that it’s not really worth the asking price on the secondary market now IMO.  It’s worth a try at a bar if you can get it for under $12-15, though.  Cheers."

4.75,Tasted at Josh’s.  Unbelievable.  So smooth you could chug it.  Only thing holding it back for me selfishly is it’s not a lot of rye so it isn’t very spicy.  But awesome.

5.0,"I hate to harp on this but as per usual the ""expert"" reviewer had absolutely botched this review up. To even make the statement that the finish ""hits you like a 2*4 to remind you it's from the US of A"" tells me all I need to know about his credibility. @Mikkel definitely needs to look at who is assigned to review American Whiskey because this bias is pretty prevalent on here and honestly and this point I have no faith in their reviews.

Ok, no I am off my high horse! For those of you that have read my reviews I hope trust I am impartial and love Whiskey expressions for all over the globe so here goes a fair review of what is truly an exceptional dram... 

It enters rich and soft with a pronounced orange marmalade note. Vanilla and cinnamon are layered in with a toasted oak back bone. Mid palette brings some dark red fruit notes... Both dried and fresh... Tobacco and baking spices lead the long finish which brings back more toasted oak. The balance is exceptional. The mouthfeel is exceptional. The Bourbon is unique and exceptional. 

Cheers all!"
