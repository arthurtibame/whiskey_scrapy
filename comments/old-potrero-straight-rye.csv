null,"A bit overhyped.   Not on this site,  but in general this gets a fair amount of press for a non-MGP rye.   Very spicy,  tastes of wood at the start.   Finishes with a kick of spice and some astringency.   Very good but not great.  A bit pricey,  but produced in SF so I can see why."

3.0,Very smooth going down. Little bite at the bottom. Not a lot of distinct  flavors. Vs Old Weller was better.

3.0,"It’s alright. Aroma is soft and interesting with a touch of spice that pulls it all together; Palate is tasty, sweet and light with that same touch of spice still holding everything together; Finish is the most rustic aspect of the whiskey pulling in more copper and spice than fruit."
2.5,"This rye whiskey is a caramel syrup color with thick semi-watery legs.

The nose is sweet and funky with notes of flowers, strawberry yogurt, caramel, sea salt, banana bread, French toast, camomile, and orange peel.

The palate has notes of vanilla, oaky tannins, cherry candy, rye spice, sweet smoke, and for being at least two years old, it tastes young to me,

The finish has sweet and spice and it tapers off on the end. Cheers!"
2.0,Heavy cedar/sage for me. Reminded me of Willett Pot Still that I really did not care for.

3.25,"Nose: Grain, oak.  Cinnamon, clove, bread, dill, cardamom, cumin.  Fennel.

Palate: Brown sugar, oak, vanilla.  Vegetal.  Clove, cinnamon, dill, cream.  Black pepper.  Play-doh.

Other notes: This comes across as younger.  More time in the barrel and/or some finishing options would have gone a long way."

2.5,"Bold, brash flavor but too young and rough for my tastes. Pretty decent mixer in a Sazerac though."
