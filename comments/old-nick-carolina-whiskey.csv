3.5,"Sweet, wheater with wood grain flavor. A tad young, but not unappealing. Butterscotch and caramel."

4.0,"I think this is the same mash bill as their Old Nick wheated bourbon (which is also excellent, by the way). Corn and grain heavy. Definitely not neutral like a vodka. Has a slight tequila'ish note to it. Pairs very well with citrus. In the summer when I fix the woman to whom I'm related by marriage a Hendrick's and tonic a healthy pour of this with the rest of the bottle of tonic makes an excellent drink."
5.0,Awesome sipping whiskey.  Smooth throughout the tasting profile. Awarded the 2018 San Francisco’s spirit award double gold star.
