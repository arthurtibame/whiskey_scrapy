null,"Not so fond of this variant, the single cask cask strength variants however are splendid. Despite 70 or more degrees, they make a lasting impression. Waiting for a 12y old with sherry cask finish. The latter I tasted from an independent bottler en was out of this world. Etienne, please please!"

3.0,"Being a great fan of French whisky, I was eager to try a whisky from a neighbouring country and I was also beckoned by the fresh, oily, lemon, citrus smell.
        At first I was hit by the oiliness, the sweetness and subtle notes of coconut the whisky had to offer, then a rapid slew of flavours arrived: bitter hard candy giving a soft and warm bite, plum wine, hard apple candy, bitter unripe and overripe cherry, all on top of a leitmotiv of lemon and peppery spicy leather. As the finish arrived, the drink became toastier, then softened with the return of plum wine, white wine and brioche.
        The whisky was quite pleasant, but unfortunately, it was too young, the bourbon cask was overbearing and the whisky was somewhat simple. It reminded me of a Highland malt, but without that earthy, herbal profile, but it was also quite close to French whisky in its sweetness and fruitiness. I do hope these people succeed at making an older whisky, France has produced stunning 2 year old whiskys such as Michel Couvreur Clearach or Guillon 46, so youth isn't the only problem here, the real problem is a lack of compelling flavour, personality and quality, but the whisky remains a promising start."
