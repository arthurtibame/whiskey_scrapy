4.0,"I had a sample of this, curious to try Swedish whiskey, but wasn't willing to purchase a full bottle for that curiousity.  I love the color of this liquid.  It's reddish brown, like fall maple tree colors.  The nose is of blackberries and red wine. Flavor carries through a clean wintergreen red berry flavor.  This is such the wrong season to have this.  I think it's meant for winter or a chilly fall night.   Finish is sharp and quick; minty.   I was pleasantly surprised by this.  It's clean, fresh, and warming.  I bought a sample of this last year from the UK, I wish I simply saved it for the winter.  It's really a great cold, windy night drink.  On a side note...the bottle takes me back to my Chemical engineering days at U of Michigan ( go WOLVERINES!!).  I swear those crafty Swedes simply took a bunch of 500ml beakers from the local chem lab."

4.0,Peaty，smooth and flavorful.  I'd never heard of this distillery so had no preconceived expectations.  Turns out this is quite good.
