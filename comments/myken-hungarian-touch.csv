3.0,"Ever heard of Myken? Far out in the Norwegian Sea, this small island is home to 12 inhabitants - and the world's first Arctic whisky distillery! Partly matured in 50 l Hungarian oak casks, the nose of this young malt is fruity, spicy and yeasty. Gooseberries, mango and vanilla mix with juniper, cereals and hints of sawdust. On the palate, a briny punch of virgin oak dominates the vivid and youthful taste, followed by Greek yogurt, white pepper and unripe pears. Lemongrass, wood spices and espresso notes remain in the medium finish. Not bad for a 3-year-old!
