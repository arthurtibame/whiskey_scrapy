3.75,"Decent whiskey, easy to drink."
2.75,Classic Speyside scotch. Smooth. Butterscotch. Ambiguous nose.
3.0,"Green fruit and vanilla in the nose, slight Ash. Creamy taste but sharp for the age. More vanilla and caramel in the taste and slight coal smoke, not much change with a little water. Nothing amazing but not bad at $40"
