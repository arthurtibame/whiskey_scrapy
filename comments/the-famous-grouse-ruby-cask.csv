3.5,"Slight rose hue to the coloring.  Nice sweet fruity aroma, medium body, and medium sweetness.  Tastes of cinnamon, cloves, oak, and vanilla.  Very pleasant and mild.  Such an easy sipper."

Overall, It is okay to try again. It might be a good starter to try port cask"
4.0,"Dried fruits and nuts on the nose. The palate is dried oranges and a hint of chocolate. The finish is short, but peppery. At this price point I’m extremely surprised at its high quality. 

On the second sip, the nose really opens up with chocolate and vanilla which carries through to the palate."
