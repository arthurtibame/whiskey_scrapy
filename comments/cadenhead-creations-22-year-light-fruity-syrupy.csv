4.0,"Another lovely blend from Cadenhead, this time comprising Ben Nevis, Blair Athol and Tomintoul, and bottled from a single cask that was vatted together in 2007. Bright orchard fruits up front, gooseberries in the middle, and a milky chocolate finish that fades to the partly dissolved sugar at the bottom of your tea cup."
