4.0,"This particular Oyo whiskey is a white rye made and barrelled in small batches in the heart of the Ohio River Valley.  It is distilled from 100% rye grown in Ohio and is 110 proof.

The nose of the whiskey is sweet and smells of grains.  It is reminiscent of sweet corn syrup, grains, and honey.  there is a burning scent of alcohol in the tail of the nose.

The whiskey tastes of sweet corn and spicy rye.  As expected of a white whiskey, the grain flavors come to the fore.  It has a pleasant, velvety mouthfeel that works with the spice very well.  A very good drink."
