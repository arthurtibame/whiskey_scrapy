5.0,one of the best i have ever had for sipping.
5.0,"Sweet vanilla and fruity nose, very mild and enjoyable. The pallet starts off very sweet,  and the peppery rye comes in on the back. There is a touch of oak and char offsetting the sweetness abit. Overall very smooth with a good mouth feel. The medium finish brings more pepper, char and vanilla/ caramel sweetness. 

Like most EH Taylor releases it does not disappoint and is worth the retail price of admission."

3.0,"BT's stereotypical yeast really comes through on the nose and makes a few promises that don't pan out on the palate. It's not bad, but there's an odd astringency that prevents it from being anything more than decent."

4.0,Classic BT nose plus a bit of almond and toffee. Good nose. Smooth and light. A bit of spice at the end. And what you've read about the finish is right... it's loooooong. Sweet mild nutty. Intriguing. 9/25/17

4.0,"Aroma of sweet vanilla, oak and grain.  Flavor is sweet grain with more vanilla and solid oak presence.  Hints of cherry.  Noticeable alcohol heat, but not unwelcome."
4.0,9-21-17. Good stuff 4.3. Smooth but complex.  Drink it all day
3.0,"This bourbon gets its name from its unconventional mash bill, which includes both wheat and rye (almost all bourbons opt for either corn-rye-barley or corn-wheat-barley combinations).  Rye tends to produce spicy flavors, and wheat tends to produce lighter, fruitier, sweeter flavors, so it's a wonder that more brands don't try this type of experiment.  While I applaud the inventive attitude, however, this drink struck me as a little weak.  The nose features some unusual flavors, including hoisin sauce, cereal grains, and musty wet oak and leather.  The palate surprisingly hits a strong rye chord, has a bread-like yeast flavor, and is quite tannic, which indicates a decent amount of aging.  The combination of tannins and sweeter fruit notes in the midpalate are reminiscent of a Burgundy wine.  The tannins somewhat obscure the fact that the mouthfeel is not very oily and may even be watery on some sips.  This finishes like a rye-based bourbon, with an herbal and spicy kick.  Overall, the wheat did not express itself as strongly as I anticipated.  Not what I was expecting, and not (to my tastes) worth the hype."

5.0,"The last of the bonus samples from this round of our distillery tour group. Colonel E.H. Taylor Four Grain is a special release from Buffalo Trace. Made with a mash bill of corn, rye, wheat and barley (hence the name Four Grain). Bottled in bond which of course means 50% ABV and since it’s a Kentucky straight bourbon it is also natural color, this is a dark copper. I would guess that it is also non chill filtered. It comes in at the ripe old age of 12 years old. 

The nose is full and powerful. It starts off with a big mint note, but that fades fast and doesn’t really come back. Sweet corn, candy corn and a little bubblegum. It’s also fruity with cinnamon apples and some muted oranges. Cherries, cherry syrup and cherry cough syrup. Love those cherries!  Some rye spice and warm rye bread. Sweet and spicy oak, vanilla, caramel and dark toffee. Red and black licorice, anise, clove and cinnamon. A softness from the wheat comes through in the fruitier notes. Vanilla coffee or mocha and light maple syrup all come through after time in the glass. My oh my this is a great complex nose. Fun to dissect. 

The palate is even more powerful and arrives spicy. Charred oak, licorice and rye punch though at first. It softens a little with sweet corn, vanilla, caramel and toffee. Pepper and more charred oak hang around. It does get a little fruity with apples, pears and cherries/cherry pie filling. Demanding, but rewarding. 

A full bodied mouthfeel that instantly dries the mouth, then becomes mouthwatering, but then dry again. 
A long finish that again is very dry. Oak, vanilla and corn slowly fade away until, hopefully, you take another sip. 

After reading Lee’s review I was excited for a top notch bourbon, and that’s what I got. A near perfect nose, but the palate was just a tad too demanding to make it truly superb. It’s close though, very close. It just keeps evolving in the glass, something I always find as the mark of a truly great whisk(e)y. If you have the opportunity to buy this one for retail prices, jump on it. Secondary market prices...depends on how much you like a quality bourbon. A big thanks to @LeeEvolved for the sample. 4.75 
Cheers"

5.0,"I was able to land this rare bottle of E.H. Taylor SKBW Four Grain through the state of Virginia's limited edition bottle lottery system.  I won the ability to purchase it for $70, which at the time seemed rather expensive, but looking online tonight I see that it's going for $300-400 at several online retailers.  Perhaps I shouldn't have opened this one so quickly.  Anyway....

It's Bottled In Bond, meaning it's a perfectly rounded 100 proof.  It's copper colored and smells fantastic.  There's a bit of rye spice up front with a nice, sweet candied corn aroma that pushes through when you inhale deeply.  Oddly enough, there's no presence of heat on the nose, even for 100 proof.  The malty and sweet aspect keep the rye in check, which is a plus to me.  I'm not a big fan of rye whiskey.

On the tongue, the initial sweet corn and smooth wheat flavor meld perfectly through mid sip, where the rye spice makes an appearance as it mingles perfectly with the vanilla and oak tannins.  There's just enough bite on the back of the tongue- pepper, charred oak and vanilla.  It rounds out a near perfect whiskey pour.  

The finish is exquisite- even to a Scotch snob like myself.  It's long and warming.  Oak, rye and sweet corn.  A slow exhale really pushes everything forward and finishes the experience wonderfully.  My bourbon loving friends brag about Pappy, Weller and EH Taylor being the epitome of American whiskey and I will confess that it's pretty damn good for the Scotch lovers out there, as well.  I could sip this one all day.  4.75 stars.  It would be hard for me to justify the current price of $300+, but for the $70 I paid I feel like I stole it from my local liquor store.  Cheers, my friends."

5.0,"A Sunday evening finds me in a mood for bourbon.  It just so happens I have a sample supplied by @LeeEvolved as part of our SDT group as a bonus.  I have never had taste of any of the Colonel E.H. Taylor.  There are bourbons and then there are bourbons.  I always look forward to the later.
    
    Take an inhale and the sweetness of corn awakens the senses along with a swirl of alchohol vapors.  A mild sweetness keeps steady consisting of caramel, vanilla and candy corn.  A touch of almond nuttiness and rye keep the nose grounded.
    
    Cinnamon spice arrival (Red Hots cinnamon) in a velvety body and awakens the palate.  Rather surprising given the high proof and is pleasantly uncommon.  As the Red Hots kick subsides, the other flavors of butterscotch, Marischano cherries, vanilla with oak char create a wonderful blend in the palate.  Rye notes keeps a warming spiciness as it fades to the finish.
    
    Grain alchohol, burnt toast and orange bitters begin the finish.  As it ultimately fades in a long lasting finish, the final remnants of cloves and baking spices gently close the journey.
    
    A touch of water softens and rounds the dram, but takes away from the true character of the whiskey.
    
    This is a great bourbon.  The grain blend contains the oak dryness and cinnamon that can overwhelm a bourbon.  This is the style of bourbon that I enjoy most: the cinnamon strength, cherry notes and oak and char and rye undertones.  Bookers, Four Roses and now the Colonel.  A trifecta of bourbons.  Thanks @LeeEvolved for kindly sharing. [Dry Glass: Cherried-Candy corns][94/100][Tasted: 11/12/17]"

A very complex nose full of different smells: sugar, caramel, butterscotch, oak. 

The flavor is good. It’s got a lot going on given the 4 different grains used. It’s smooth and still has a solid taste that lingers into a long finish. 

It’s good. Very good. Whiskey of the year? I’m not an expert but I’ve had better. If you can get this for MSRP, it’s worth it all day. But $300-400 a bottle? Hard pass."

5.0,"I won a chance to purchase a bottle of this in the PA Limited Release Liquor Lottery held once or twice a year. One of the 5 selections this year included the Michter's 25 yr at $2K. Needless to say, I didn't click that particular entry box. As far as what I did get, it's nice they only charge the going rate. I'll give it a 5 star for now even though I haven't opened it yet. Will come back and change things if needed when I taste it with friends. Or if I hold it awhile, I'll see about getting a couple of fingers with a tasty whisky burger at Garryowen's here in Gettysburg, just to keep things honest.

Edit 1/25/20: Still unopened and when last I looked the darn thing was going for $1k. Nice return on $80 thanks to the PLCB lottery. Now, if I could just score a win with the annual Pappy event. Fingers crossed.

3.75,"The nose is spicy and oily with some herbal notes and hint of licorice. The nose also has plentiful rich vanilla and hints of almond as well as something meatier like gochujang pork. The palate is rich and oily with a prickly spiciness that doesn't overwhelm. The richness has a bit too much bitterness and oiliness, but sweet vanilla and toasted almond come in, giving it a hedonistic flavor. It's sweet, but also has a strong bitterness the mixes licorice with gochujang pork a bit - the age and char definitely come through. While the char doesn't overwhelm, it is a bit more present than I'd like and the flavor despite being well rounded isn't incredibly deep and complex. It has a faint allusion to fruit and floral elements, but those characteristics are barely present. Smoke is quite strong here, as is oil and some tartness (the sweetness is much stronger though). The harshness of the spiciness and the high proof gradually builds up and borders on becoming overwhelming, but with some water it is well under control. The viscosity is really incredible. This is a terrific bourbon, though it lacks complexity and has some flaws. It tastes like a much older version of a standard bourbon. Unlike with Corsair Grainiac, the various grains don't stand out here with added complexity. It's very tasty and the bitterness and smoke eventually die down, though the pepper stays there with a bit of a tart kick. It's full and rich with a lot of nice sweet vanilla. This is a bourbon for manly men. The odd gochujang flavor continues to come through, though it never is overwhelming. It's very good and I'd put it about on par with Booker's and Belle Meade Cask Strength, though the odd flavors push it down a bit. Belle Meade Cask Strength is probably the closer comparison - spicy and not quite as good. As good as it is though, the price is really hard to justify."
4.25,Sweet vanilla on the nose with a hint of oak. The palate begins with a short hit of sweet vanilla followed by a rye spice that again fades to a frosting type sweetness. The finish is medium with a decent hug. As the finish fades more spice comes through on the palate.
