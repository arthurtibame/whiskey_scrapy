3.75,"Neat. Neck pour.  7.5 year old.  Super nutty!  Geez almost Circus Peanuts even.  Nuttiness mixed with a strawberry taffy.  Lots of vanilla.  Herbal quality to it too.  Maybe nutmeg and clove.  Hint of mint.  Lot going on with this nose. 

Texture isn’t thin but I wouldn’t describe it as creamy either. Vanilla and cinnamon at first but quietly gives way to the peanuts and taffy.  Legs are peanuts and a hint of oak.  The taffy comes back in the aftertaste.

I associate taffy/bubble gum with young craft whiskey, so surprised to find it here in a 7.5 year Heaven Hill.  Luckily it has a lot going on around it to save the experience.  Super smooth, light, but flavorful sipper."

3.5,"A little harsh neat, but mellows significantly with an ice cube. Not a bad sipper, but somewhat unremarkable."
3.75,"Barreled 25 January 2012 (barrel #430), bottled 16 February 2020. Honey colored and buttery look; thin, sticky legs. 

Nose is barrel char, peanut, molasses, vanilla. Potpourri tickle in the second wave, orange rind and a dash of cinnamon. 

The taste is heavier on the herbs & spices: coriander, mint leaf, clove, apricot, with a second wave of apple skins.

Finish is charcoal, mint, chocolate and a tannic pucker. The barrel char takes on more of a sherry-like component, with a metallic, inky astringency. This is a heck of a bargain for $25."

4.0,"EWSB 2012 VINTAGE* 
BARREL #: 499 
AGE: 8 YEARS & 18 DAYS 
*Single Barrel Product. Your Mileage May Vary.  

NOSE: Deep Caramel, Vanilla, Juicy Fruit Gum, Barrel Oak, Peanuts, Dried Corn, & Straw. This is the textbook classic bourbon nose. After some time in my Glencairn, a Vegetal note appears and begins to dominate.  
NEAT: The mouthfeel is definitely on the lighter side, but I would in no way consider it thin. The palate is Oak Driven. Vanilla, Caramel, & Dubble Bubble Gum. Very Straightforward. Not complex, but what it does, it does well. A little heat on the sides of the tongue and mouth with a light Kentucky Hug. Vanilla and slightly bitter oak coat the palate. Reminds me of a watered down/muted HMcK10. 
SPLASH: The nose and palate both pick up a Maple note. The Heaven Hill Peanut also appears on the palate along with a little more soft oak.  

VERDICT: Several years ago, this was the first Single Barrel product I ever purchased. Back then, the age was running around 10 years. It was without a doubt, one of the best sub-$30 bourbons around. Then as demand increased, the age of each subsequent ""vintage"" became younger and younger (if memory serves, some vintages were in the 6 year range). That was also about the time that NC ABC's decided to start carrying HMcK10. Same classic Heaven Hill mash bill. 14 proof points higher. Single Barrel as well as boasting a full 10year age statement...for less money! It became a no-brainer. Now that the McKenna has crept up to $40 and is hard to find? This is a damn fine substitute, especially now that supply is starting to catch up and the age on EWSB is starting to slowly creep back toward that magic 9-10 year sweet spot. This is once again becoming one of the better sub-$30 options on the shelf."
