4.5,"Nose: An immediate sooty, lemon/orange punch that takes no prisoners. Not harsh, but uncompromising. Wet sand and mud - the smells of a seaside field on a squally day with an oily, citrus tinged smoke to windward. A lot of brine and peaty aromas. This particular expression is not soft  - it's rather angular and brisk like a blustery, chill morning.  How invigorating! With water the nose opens up beautifully, but don't overdo it and soften it too much - just a few drops is all it needs to relax.

Palate: A briny and spicy dark jaffa cake and chocolate arrival with bitter citrus fruits, green olives, dried muscat grapes, ash and smoke. The development brings out sweetness all over the palate whilst the salty umami foundation perseveres. With water the sweet character is intensified, but so is the spiciness, all in balance. Cloves and a touch of cinnamon.

Finish: Long, with lemon peel and smoky, earthy, phenolic characteristics slowly dying away, like the embers of a beach-side barbecue the morning after.  With water the sweetness and smoke are both intensified.

The best Loch Gorm yet, in my opinion. There are features of something from all the previous expressions, but in balance. This would be one to collect, if one did such things ... nah, just enjoy it.

In the past I've generally found Kilchoman whiskies to be too young and undisciplined to be really enjoyable but this is changing, and has been for a while now. This and Sanaig are the high points for me now, but I bet in the next year or two we'll be hearing great things about the whole range.  I predict 12-14 years will be the magic maturation time for this distillate.

If I was rating this out of 100 then at the moment it would be just one point lower than the current batch of Sanaig, but next time round it might be even better.

""Excellent"" : 4.5 stars"

3.0,"Permit me to quote one of the great poets of our generation, B-Real: here is something you can't understand, how I could just Kilchoman.

Sultana on the nose, and salt & seaweed on the palate. 

It's a decent whisky to drink, and an even better remedy to reduce inflammation of the gums. Cheers!"

4.0,"Appearance: The color was a honey / amber and the legs were thin and very viscous.

Nose: The nose started off for me with strong notes of peat, seaweed, and brine. As the whisky breathed though, subtler notes of honey and flowers arose as well.

Taste: The palate was delicious and very unique. I started of getting notes of salt, various herbs, and even baked broccoli. But again with a little patience sweeter notes of lemon and cinnamon / snickerdoodle cookies came up after a few minutes.

Finish: The finish was long, lingering, and warm.

Thoughts: Wow. So I just had this dram as a bonus whisky at a Whisky Ambassador training near me in Denver and I was very impressed. I really liked this Scotch! Would I buy it again? Oh yeah! Would I recommend it! Definitely yes. Kilchoman, keep up the quality work! Sláinte!"

4.0,"Still catching up on Feis Ile 2018 updates, now working through my Kilchoman notes. 
   Sanaig and Loch Gorm are two of Kilchoman's expressions that feature significant sherry influence, and the  differences between the two were undoubtedly subtle.  Loch Gorm has a dry, chalky, medicine tablet scent that belies a sweet, malty, and sherry-influenced palate.  Loch Gorm is one of the less smoky Kilchomans, although there are wisps of it curling up in the mid-palate through the finish, which is also slightly grassy and fruity.  Not quite enough smoky assertiveness here to hit squarely in my wheelhouse, but enjoyable nonetheless.  Sanaig gives a similar experience and is significantly cheaper, so that one gets my nod, but you couldn't go wrong with either one."
