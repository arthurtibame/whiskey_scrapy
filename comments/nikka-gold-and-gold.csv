2.0,The whiskey is outshined by the bottle. Oaky and dark. Starts fine but becomes harder to enjoy as time goes on.
4.5,Ridiculously good and smooth

3.25,"Un nez excellent : épices, bois grillé, miel.

Très doux et rond en bouche, sucré avec une belle note de miel et vanille. Intéressant mais manque de complexité."

3.0,"Nose - Clean apple/pear/Asian pear, barrel aged cider, dark honey, caramel.

Taste - Dark honeyed light fleshed fruits, apples, Asian pears, hint of longan sweet/metallic, light pepper tingle, Asian pear skin bitterness/dryness.

Finish - Light warmth, lingering Asian pear sweet (like it's been sitting out a bit & has oxidized to a light brown), honey.

Score - 74/100

Final Thoughts - I will admit I got this bottle purely because it looked cool. The metal samurai topper is just amazing presentation. That being said, the whisky inside isn't horrible, but it isn't great either. Like a good majority of the whisky made in Japan, I think this was fully intended to go in a highball versus sipped neat. Neat, it's not bad, somewhat easy sipping, just not something I'd really reach for. The flavors are subtle but present, but are a bit one-dimensional and have a very ""summery"" feel that I think would be better in cocktails or a highball versus sipped neat.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - Maybe if they had another bottle topper design."

4.0,Sherry and smoke. A very well executed blend. One hell of a cool bottle.

3.0,"I found this bottle unattended, hanging from a hook in the mens bathroom. The nose is sweet, with a bit of a fruit smell. I am not particularly fond of it, but don't hate it. The taste is smoky and oeaty with just a slight bitter finish. Not the best thing I ever had, but I like it enough to drink it slowly. LOVE the bottle."

3.0,"Bright and vanilla on the nose, already some hints of harshness. Oaky. Tastes brittle, not overly complex, hints of maltiness and sweetness but quickly overwhelmed by bitterness. Water opens up sweetness a bit but the bitterness will not be denied. Seems young and best suited for a cocktail."
