3.0,"Visited the distillery and tried their bourbon flight at the attractive little bar they've put in place (you can get cocktails etc. made with their products as well, yay!) Flight currently includes this Four Grain as the ""baseline"" offering, a Single Barrel version of the 4 Grain, and a Port Finished expression clocking in at 110.8 proof and $100 a bottle. Regular 4 Grain very admirable for a youngster, similar to some of Reservoir Distillery's selections in Richmond VA but gone maverick with the additional grains - a previous review mentioned ""hot electronics"" as a taste and I am in agreement. Very fun. Single Barrel is a step up, with only a hint of that back-throat tip-of-tongue moonshine fire and more woody smoothness (at least regarding the present batch, #200.) Port Finish I'm not sure I would shell out $100 for, but it's far from a failed attempt; adding a decent dose of water opens it up nicely, giving access to the chocolate cherry notes touted by the bartender, and in that it's my pick of the litter. Also the pours are generous and they give you pretzels to munch... not bad for $14 if you can get out here."

4.0,"This one is interesting.  I can't tell if it's bourbon, Scotch, or something different altogether.  What I like about maverick whiskies is that they push the boundaries and make something totally different.  They have to, in a way---they don't have the benefit of being able to afford keeping their spirit for three years stored away, so they get creative.  I'm not sure how to describe the aroma...sort of a mix of car oil, electronic spark, and linseed oil.  In a really good way.  Flavor:  young, woody...with a hefty dose of mint, vanilla, caramel, and..there it is..now I'm getting that bourbon sweetness.  This isn't for everyone...it's not your typical whiskey---either you'll like it, or you'll think ""what the heck is this?!!?""   Personally---I like it---so very different...sort of like having Mezcal for the first time...just a different beast.  Geology Jack---thank you for this experience!  Broadened my horizon to something totally different."

5.0,"I didn't expect to find this Rochester NY product in Maryland but I lucked out at Pine Orchard in Ellicott City where I picked a bottle from Batch #5 for about $45. I was intrigued by the mash bill that suggested I might be able experience bourbon, rye and scotch in a single product.  First the bottle - it is heavy and thick, and it made me want to pull the cork with my teeth and splash a pour into an unwashed glass (""Barkeep! I'll take the whole bottle. And you better have another one ready""). With my nose in the glass, I found the same bread-yeasty fragrance that I noted in other fast-aged maverick, American single malts, such as Defiant and Kopper Kettle. There was also a hint of flax seed, mint  and vanilla as the glass set awhile. It tasted young and oaky with a hint of sweetness just before the rye spicey burn came through. A few drops of water allowed more of the bourbon vanilla and caramel notes to come through. The rye continued on through the finish.  I'm not sure I picked up on the malted barley (I better have another pour), but this whiskey is every bit as good as I had hoped.  Not-Quite-So-Dry glass: this smells exactly like what I remember as a kid of the scattered glasses and soaked table cloths after a house party that always made my mother so mad. Dry glass: vanilla and dark Karo syrup."

3.25,"If the team at Black Button set out to offer something original, their Four Grain Bourbon hits the mark for those looking for something outside the box.

Truth be told, I love when a distillery colors outside the lines. For me, when distilleries take risks, their drive for creativity often outweigh the end product, even if the end product isn’t terribly enjoyable. A dram can be artistic expression, and the process is sometimes more exciting than the piece itself.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS - My initial reaction is that Black Button Four Grain Bourbon is extremely light and fleeting, similar to a watery Irish Whisky. I didn’t love it as first, but after three drams, it’s growing on me. This one takes a few rounds to fully “get” but if you’re willing to appreciate it for what it is, you may come around.

NOSE - I find mild tones of sugary spices and caramel. There is definitely rich corn sweetness alongside extremely light molasses. The nose carries an essence of rye with a lavender subtlety. Think Dad's Hat Pennsylvanian Rye mixed with Brenne French Single Malt. It’s very interesting to say the least.

PALATE - the palate is dry, showcasing walnuts and salty almonds. The sweetness of the nose shows up here too with some toasted caramel, butter, and a savory oatmeal notes. 

The mouthfeel is medium-light and not all that complex.

WASH - You’ll find some residual heat here but it won’t last long, so don’t get attached. The finish leaves behind some nice sugary tones but those soon turn more nutty and savory. This is quite fleeting.

WHAT I APPRECIATED - This bourbon is a fun copilot, helping you ease into summer. If I were to receive a dram of this upon arriving at a barbecue, this would be eagerly welcomed and delightful. It’s playful and refreshing enough to check some boxes and prepares the palate for more. On the other hand though, if this were served as an exit dram at the end of the night, I’d feel a bit disappointed. 

CONCLUSION - This bourbon is youthful, flirtatious, and light, finding a place on the shelf of a collector or more adventurous dabbler. However, it lacks the nuances found in more mature bourbons. If you’re looking for something with more kick, or even with more of a traditional bourbon profile, look elsewhere.
