3.5,"I have seen so much of this whisky all over the place. It is selling like crazy here in south america, but somehow i always knew this distillery has nothing to offer me. 

Bottled at 40% abv, this is a speysider so brace yourself for boringness.

I believe this is their cheapest expression.

On the nose it is your classic speysider: apple juice, crushed almonds and cinnamon. Nothing else.

On the palate it is easy drinkable, with cinnamon spice, almonds and honey, cereal. Must be young since the oaky burn is there and it has a short aftertaste, oaky.

Not unpleasant at all, but boring. Maybe for a entry level this might work, not my cup of tea.

Overall i give it a 69 over 100. It was free in  a duty free, so i can cross this one out of my list without paying for it, which is a good thing."

4.5,"Sweet, fruitful, long lasting"
3.5,"NOSE: All fresh fruit. Pineapple, lemon, apple.

PALATE: Not a whole lot going on. Bit of lemon and sugar. Minimal pepper.

OVERALL: One of the lightest fruity sippers there is."
