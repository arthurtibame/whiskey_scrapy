4.75,"Another free pour last night, courtesy of a tasting hosted by Gary’s Wines, while offering a lottery for Pappy 20.  This was one of the highlights of the night, and probably best overall value at $40.  Tasted blind, I really would’ve thought I was having Elijah Craig barrel proof, or one of the Four Roses single barrels.  Amazingly complex, with a lingering ginger-vanilla taste.  Out of the five I tried, I placed this as #2, but best bang-for-your-buck.  ( my ranking was store version of a 15 yr old Barrell bourbon, then this New Riff Single Barrel, Blanton’s, Jefferson’s Rum, and finally Makers Mark)"

first time having New Riff.  pleasantly surprised and a welcomed change from my regulars.  Good flavor profile. I picked up light vanilla,  oak,  peppery,  and citrus.  decent lingering a bit on the back end.   I really enjoy this proof of 112.4.  I could sip on this neat all night."

3.75,"Barrel proof
NCF
This is from Barrel #14-578 (total bottles: 214)
Proof: 113.6
2018

Nose: sweet oak, candied walnuts, dark fruits — maybe cherry...almost
reminiscent of the wooded-dark cherry nose from Makers Cask and Wilderness Trail. 

Palate: quite rich, more dark fruits, vanilla, toffee, some cinnamon 

Finish: some bite, the proof comes through, but does not finish with high warmth. Quite smooth for the proof. 

This does not taste like a 4-year craft bourbon. Definitely want to come back to it. 

I compare this to Wilderness Trail bourbon (bottled-in-bond) due to price point and flavor profile, even though WTrail is a wheater. (I don’t know the mashbill of this bourbon, likely high rye, but does not seem like wheat...honestly does not seem like a high rye bourbon based on the profile but I think that’s a testament to its balance) ...Wilderness Trail beats this handily. But it’s still quite good."

4.0,"Taste:  1 oz. neat in glen cairn

Nose: (3.75)  A bit more ethanol than I would have expected at 110 proof.  There are traditional notes of vanilla, candy-corn, caramel with some new oak in the background.  I also detected a mustiness similar to what is found in most Wild Turkey.  It was interesting and not off putting.

Palate (4.25)  Nice buttery mouthfeel that is sweet and coating without being cloying. The vanilla and candy corn play through.  That mustiness is gone, I almost would have liked it to remain so I could explore it more.  A taste of fresh peanut shells comes through almost like some of the Jim Beam products have- super good here.  I did get a bit of fresh oak that may have revealed some of the spirit's youth.

Overall:  If the creators of New Riff have left some of this to age for another year or two....watch out because it could he extraordinarily good.  I found it pleasant, interesting, traditional but with an edge to it.  I am definately going to keep this one on my future radar because I am thinking when this juice stays in the barrel a year or two longer it will move from good to special"
3.75,"I picked this up a couple months ago in February, the first time I had heard of it. New Riff is a new distillery in Newport KY, just across the river from Cincinnatti. This review is of the single barrel version of New Riff’s bourbon, barrel 14930. 

This whiskey is bottled at a hearty 56.45% ABV. It’s made from a mashbill of 65% corn, 30% rye, and 5% malted barley. It’s aged “at least four years” and is non-chill filtered. 

The nose is very spicy, paying tribute to the 30% rye in the mashbill. Lots of cinnamon, red hot candies, caramel, and hints of vanilla and oak. A little heat from the ABV but very manageable. 

The palate is more of the same: big, bold sweet cinnamon with more of the red hots.   This is like cinnamon whiskey without the sickening sweet syrup. There are also hints of vanilla and baking spices behind the cinnamon.

The finish is medium length with peppery rye spice, charred oak, and a hint of smoke. I really like this whiskey but I can see where some may not. I like high rye bourbons, and I like the cinnamon flavors. It is a bit one dimensional l, but then again so are most bourbons. This was $50 at my local Kroger and at that price it’s a pretty decent value for a true cask strength bourbon. Very good. 3.75/5"

4.0,"Non-chill filtered and 112.9 proof.  Barrel #15-2672 (208 bottle yield) aged 4 years (distilled Spring 2015 and bottled Spring 2019).  It has the same high rye mash as the Bonded version 65% corn, 30% rye, and 5% malted barley.

N:  Fresh cut wood, mint, nutmeg, vanilla, brown sugar and cinnamon.

P:  Creamy toffee, maple syrup, peppermint, vanilla and a bit of cocoa.

F:  Oily mouth coating keeps the toffee on the tongue just a little bit longer - then diminishes as peppermint, spices, and almonds take over.

This is very similar to their bottled in bond bourbon.  This is just a little more vibrant on the flavorings because of the proof.  I think the relatively low age and high rye mash bill work well here.   If you don’t like the spice, just let your glass air out a bit, and it will sweeten up some to balance it more if you desire (and don’t mind a little wait).  It’s nicely put together and enjoyable.  I look forward to their future offerings."

Finishes with that lovely charred barrel and spices.

Overall, has an excellent spicy character and such a great collection of different notes on the palette and finish."

Nice vanilla sweetness upfront on the taste, gives way to the apple and cherry.  Leaves you with cinnamon and a bit of a Kentucky hug at 112.5 proof.

I can’t wait to try older New Riff in a few years.  What they are doing at 4 years is so crazy good."
3.75,"New Riff Single Barrel is a 4 year old bourbon out of the New Riff distillery that used to source their bourbon under the name OKI.  I did not get the chance to taste any of the OKI stuff but heard very good things about it.  New Riff stopped sourcing their bourbon when theirs finally reached four years old.  This is one of their first offerings on their own and from what I can taste in this one they are on track to becoming a great distillery in the future.  The color is a light copper.  The legs are thin but run very slow.  The aroma is vanilla, caramel, oak, with a whiff of alcohol.  The taste is vanilla, caramel, oak, some spice, with the alcohol lingering.  The finish is medium with the caramel, vanilla, and spices hanging around.  I can’t wait to see what New Riff comes out with in 6 or more years from now.  I think this distillate will be amazing after a little more time in the wood."

The palate starts with vanilla bean and baking spices, moves on to dry fruits and then back to the first notes. The pleasant high proof stays with you for a while, from the nose all the way to the finish. The finish is long and the flavors keep on coming at you. Only downside was that it left my tongue dry at first, but only on the first two sips. Overall, I was not expecting this to be so good. Really recommend having this in your collection."
4.0,"Nose: sweet cinnamon, vanilla, barrel char, sweet tabaco, the proof jumps out. Taste: super sweet and spicy, first sip will hit you with the proof, almost same flavor profile as the Jack Daniels Single Barrel Barrel Proof but with a lighter body.

If you are in to high proof bourbons, this is one is a must."

3.75,"A sample from dthom as part of the ""Whiskey transfer program"".

Nose: Vanilla, brown sugar, apple skins, and some of the herbal dill notes that I expect from a high rye bourbon.  Very mild alcohol on the nose given the high proof.  A background wood note as well.

Flavor: Sweet with heavy caramelized brown sugar and vanilla, baking spices, wood, and leather.  Really smooth with a buttery mouth feel and I barely get the proof at all.

Finish: Finishes spicy with a lot of wood, black pepper, and barrel spice.  A shorter finish than I'd expect at the proof but this probably reflects the 4 year aging.

Overall I really enjoyed this but felt like it was a little one dimensional.  The four year aging is working against this whiskey a little and I think 2-4 more years would make this a powerhouse."

3.5,"Pretty neutral and flat nose, but a deeper nosing shows a bit of the 112.5 proof.  Subtle notes of lime peel, surprisingly enough.

Interesting to try side by side with the BiB.  Notably dry, this barrel lacks almost all of the caramel sweetness the BiB showcases underneath its rye and proof spice.  Ratchets up the iodine, hints of baking spice but very dry.  Unexpectedly, not much extra sweetness even after adding a few drops.  The finish lingers long with a gentle burn.  Well crafted, but doesn’t deliver the classic bourbon flavors I’m after for the proof and cost.

Continued tasting after lighting a super mild Connecticut cigar, and it actually teased out the sweetness a bit, muting the dry spice.  Vanilla soaked pear on the nose and the taste becomes a clear creme brûlée.  A good pair after all is said and done."

Oak, leather, vanilla, tobacco and honey on the palate. Nice barrel proof kick! Nice spice as well. 

Oak and cinnamon red hots in the medium length finish with honey at the end.

Gets spicier the longer I spend with it.  Intense rye and peppers.  Molasses.  Orange peel.  This one is tickling my nose everywhere.

Very thick and syrupy on the tongue.  All vanilla and dark brown sugars gives way to intense oak and cherry.  Followed by caramel and vanilla covered in powder sugar.  

This is an intense and delicious New Riff.  I’ve had all these flavors on other barrels but never all at once and this intense.  An amazing pick and fitting for an anniversary."

Mouth - hot on the tongue, a little musty, robust and complex beyond its 4 year age statement
Finish - warm, smooth, chocolate

I can definitely see what the fuss is about. Solid bourbon and I’m excited to see what some more age has to offer."

4.25,"Color is slightly on the lighter golden side. Legs are indicative of the 111 proof. Nose is sweet and oaky with a slight spicy kick. Palate has a nice spice to it initially that opens up to vanilla and honey; lighter notes of florals above. Leaves a nice tingle on the tongue and in the mouth but is surprisingly smooth in the throat. Remnant flavors of oak and those higher florals once the spice fades first. Overall, I’m actually quite impressed with the smoothness; the spiciness makes some of the more delicate flavors more difficult to pick out, but still a great bourbon."

2.5,"Alcohol is dominant and bourbon flavors play second fiddle. I little young, and the flavors that exist are nice, but ... someone scorched the mash.    There is an unmistakable tho' minor burnt note that persists on the finish.  W/o the burnt note, and w/ a few more years in a barrel this would be very nice.   Will another bottle in a couple years."

4.0,Bright and zesty fruity notes stand out on top of a base of smooth corn oil and standard bourbon notes. Bright vibrant flavors in the palate as well with blossoming spice rush. Borderline too much alcohol spice. Younger age shows in small ways but overall this is a good very enjoyable sip.

3.75,"Barrel No 15-4079.  56.7ABV
While this is very good, due to the younger age, this lacks the depth I was hoping for. I did get a lot of spice and there is some flavor there but it just seems a little muted to me. Overall good pour but I won’t be searching for another bottle right off the bat."
4.25,Easy on the nose. Vanilla is the prevailing flavor with a bit of spice. Doesn’t have the bite of most barrel proof bourbons. A very good bourbon overall.

4.0,"I see exactly what everyone means when they say with some age this will be something special. Tons of vanilla and smooth for a barrel proof bourbon, short spicy finish. A bit simple and could use some depth and complexity with some age, but I’m a fan and this is an easy sipper/crowd pleaser for sure."
3.75,I personally prefer the BIB. The notes of pepper that are in the BIB are too amplified for me in the SIB that I tried. Overall still a promising showing of what’s to come from New Riff.
3.5,"The bottle I have is a store pick single barrel from a local store in Nashville called Frugal McDugal. They were the first on Nashville to get distribution of New Riff, so I was excited to pick this up a few months back and am finally getting to try it. This one comes in at 116.3 proof at 4yrs and 3mos.

The nose has some brown sugar sweetness, baking spices, a little mint, light milk chocolate,  caramelized fruit, and some wet hay/malt and a little nuttiness.

The palate is sweet and slightly oily with wet hay, light fruit, baking spices, caramel and mint. It is slightly drying on the palate.

The finish is spicey with a burst of that wet hay note that fades into brown sugar and then into a slight bitterness  with some slight smokeyness at the tail of this shorter side of long finish.

Really not bad. It’s hits a few notes that I enjoy. Though, one note that stands out to me that I’m not a fan of is the wet hay/malty note. So if you enjoy bourbon and some malty scotches, you might really like this one."

3.75,"First thing I get on the nose is the alcohol... At 111 proof it's understandable. Nosing a little more gently I get orange rind, baking spices and rye. Initially light on the palate, but the baking spices come on hard and finishes with a lingering rye pepper that fades and leaves a little vanilla behind."

Definitely worth $50."
