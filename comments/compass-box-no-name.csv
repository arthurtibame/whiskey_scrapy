4.5,"I had heard this whisky was very good and extremely peaty. 50% of that statement was true... since it is not THAT peaty. So, you have figured out already that i loved it; and that is good because i have the overall impression that Compass Box is more marketing than Whisky. 

Bottled at 48.9%abv, this has a gold color. 

On the nose, the first sniff is smoke with pepper. Citrus, slight vanilla and a very clean grapefruit note. A little dim on the nose at first, mostly citric flavors. After the First sip, The nose becomes incredible, with the most beautiful Chocolate note ever. 

On the palate, it rocks. Incredible milk chocolate, milk powder, grapefruit, everything happening surrounded by a peppery wall. Vanilla. Very sweet and spicy. Amazing.

Aftertaste is more sulphuric, with peat smoke but very pleasant, more pepper and some citric flavors. 

Overall this is one bottle i would definitively buy repeatedly. Nice dram, interesting, lots of flavors, spiciness, sweetness and peatiness all in one, inna very balanced way. 90 over 100. Thumbs up."
4.5,"He reached into his pocket and found that he was out of rolling paper.  The ashtray next to the cold, dead body was full with embers still warm and smoking, whispering to him to leave to buy more rolling paper.  No.  He would finish.  The mourners would be gathering soon.  He had already arranged the lilies and carnations; they sat in one corner of the room giving off a gentle floral spicy scent, which pleased him.  He hated the cloying scent of most flowers, and sneered to himself as he imagined doing a wedding.  In another corner of the room, he had already prepared the food.  The last dish he made was a lemon and vanilla rice pudding.  Always a hit.  In a moment, the mishmash of aromas in the room will be unified by an emperor, when he opens the glass bottles of embalming solution.  He loved that moment and he loved his work.  Some may call him an undertaker; a mortician; or a funeral director.  But he prefers No Name for what he does.

Compass Box undersells themselves as whiskymakers.  They author whiskies.  Most of their whiskies make sense like a good story.  This one is called “Chain smoking in a funeral home.”  Carnations.  Lemon rice pudding.  Cigarettes.  Formaldehyde.  It has both the power of the anguished shrieks of the widow to greet you on the nose, and the delicate sympathetic tears of her friends in the soft and haunting finish.

I went through my first bottle much too quickly, and I am fortunate to have a backup.  This is in my top 3 Compass Box whiskies of all time.  #1 is the Flaming Heart 15th anniversary edition.  And #2 and #3 are a coin flip between this whisky and This is Not a Luxury Whisky.  I guess No Name should take the #2 spot because it is about $100 cheaper.  I’m not going to guess how old the Ardbeg, Caol Ila, or Clynelish is in this blend; and I’m not going to e-mail Compass Box either (apparently they will give you the ages of their blend components if you e-mail them).  At this point, I am enjoying the magic so much, I don’t want to ruin it by knowing the tricks. 

Score: ** (unimaginably good)
How much does a bottle cost: $120-180
How much do I think a bottle is worth?: $280"
3.75,Nose is peat smoke and iodine all day. You smell the smoke as soon as it’s poured. Palate is thick and peaty. If you are someone who says maximum peat is best you’ll give this a 5. It’s aged Ardbeg essentially but I found this too one dimensional. Long finish.

4.75,"Peaty, balanced, amazing"
5.0,Love love love! This might be the best whiskey I have ever had. Balanced peaty flavor with a wonderful body.
3.5,"Second bottle of this. 

Nose - Medicinal, sweet, puffy sweet smoke. I might get a caramel or chocolate at the very back end. it's a good peated note, but nothing special. 

Taste - The finish is awesome, tooties rolls, oak, and creme brulee. Sorry i had to jump there. The opening is a bit medicinal, slightly metallic, there's a buttery creamy sweetness. It's a lot more mellow and sweet than a normal ardbeg with their intense punch you in the face peat. This blend has calmed things down and added more sweet and savory notes. 

I'm really digging it. 3.5. It's not going to change your life or move the needle, but it's well worth chasing down if you like peat. Maybe a bit over priced though."
4.25,"So this essentially Ardbeg dominated blend is supposed to be better than any of the readily available Ardbeg releases, yeah? Well, let me tell you it’s not. It’s more of an Ardbeg for bourbon drinkers with the sweetness taking over and the peat only really coming in at the finish. I get why it’s good, it’s a good blend, but in my opinion Compass Box is like Johnnie Walker with nice labels. It’s more about style than substance. Of course they’re blending good whiskies so it tastes good, but those whiskies didn’t need to be blended in the first place. 92"

4.0,"This is a smart blend. SCIENCE! Reminds me of “Blinded by Science” from Thomas Dolby.  Anyway, the peat from the Ardbeg, smoke from Caol Ila are big on the nose, along with light citrus notes. The Clynelish most likely helps the mouth coat here on the palate. Great baby back rib flavor, with a squeeze of lemon. The finish is nice and long with more smoke, ash, and bbq. I will say that I wish there was just a touch more sherry or sweetness of sugar somewhere in here, but that’s a major first world issue. I am giving a 4.25 leaning toward a 4.5 though.  Heck of a dram! Big thanks to Mr. Pranay for a sample!"
4.0,"I might have gotten a bit too excited for this release. CB + Ardbeg + ""peatiest"" will do that to me. However, there's not nearly as much peat as I was expecting/hoping. There's more fruity honey and a lingering smoke. That's not to say this is bad, it's great and very easy to drink, but quite different from what I was expecting (it's like a slightly easier-to-drink Oogie). And, as much as I love CB, the pricing on this is about double what I'd imagine we'd be willing to pay from another producer. Alas, I keep giving them my money and staring longingly at their bottles."

5.0,"Stonkingly good. Like sucking on a piece of overcooked brisket. Okay, that may not sound gastronomically appealing but in a whisky it translates into a drink that’s deliciously meaty and smoky and dry. Sandwiched either side of these lip-smacking flavors are a typical Ardbeg nose of smoke and lemon Ricola cough drops and an aftertaste of bitter chocolate, barbecue sauce and tannins. There’s plenty of time to analyze that finish because it hangs around long enough to set up home in your mouth, unpacking its cigars and 90% cocoa Lindt bars and refusing to get off your couch. As a blend it’s outstanding. As a bastard cousin of purebred Ardbegs, it more than holds its own, easily outshining An Oa and even last year’s 21. If only those wayward relatives around your Thanksgiving table could so effortlessly  assemble themselves into a whole that’s greater than their parts. Thanks again Pranay."
5.0,"Compass Box's peatiest whisky yet.  Makes their Peat Monster look like a pussycat.  This is a mix of Ardbeg, Caol Ila, and Clynelish.  Kids, this is not for the faint of heart, and in fact I thought it has a bigger punch than a recently tasted Octomore 7.3.  Again, ppm is misleading.  Open the cork, and you can smell burnt embers.  My wife, a room away, asked if something was left burning in the oven. Taste:  Charred meat, brine and smoked herring with a slice of lemon.  Bigger emphasis on the charred meat.  Long finish.  I don't smoke, but I can imagine this being similar to a cigar finish.  I got it for $100, but I'm going to guess that it'll end up becoming more as it makes its appearance stateside.   I was asking myself why bother buying this if you can get Ardbeg 10 for much less.  Well...I think what you get in here is the waxiness from Clynelish that you wouldn't otherwise from Ardbeg or Caol Ila alone.  Sum of the parts is worth more than the individual pieces in this case.  If price points are about the same---If I had to choose only one bottle---either Ardbeg 10, Corry, Lag16, or Caol Ila...I'd instead choose this."

5.0,"The scent was iodine, and lightly floral. This is quite peaty but the finish is smooth and lasting. This limited edition is seemingly a one time only try, and totally worth it. Predominantly Ardbeg, this is a total blend of 6 whiskys and three different casks."
5.0,"This is Compass Box's ""Peatiest Dram Yet"" (Damn Right) this Whisky is an absolute beast, 75.5% of this liquid is from Ardbeg (one of my personal favourites) and it really comes through. The medicinal notes are toned down by the rest of the whisky in the blend making it extremely rich feels like you can chew on it! The great thing about this dram is how it develops over time in the glass so kick back and relax. It's a bit punchy on the ABV at 48.9%, but for me personally, it warms perfectly for this time of year.
 
Nose
Big salted chocolate, with big meaty peat and a hint of fresh dill hiding in the background
 
Palate
One of the best mouth feels I have ever had, extremely rich, salted chocolate coming back with dehydrated lemon and chewy peat
 
Finish
Long, I mean super long medicinal peat and white pepper spice, but lingering with a spicy chocolate sweetness, it's delightful."

The taste had more peat and meat with some sweetness, citrus, and brine. 
This may be the only bottle I ever see... And that's a damn shame. This might be one of my favorite whiskies."

5.0,"The best part of Distiller is the community of fellow whisky enthusiasts; in the spirit of gratitude for that online fellowship, and with deep gratitude for the generosity of @PBMichiganWolverine for sharing a wee nip of this outstanding bottle, I raise a toast. To all of you who follow, comment, discuss, debate, and joke around with me on here - slainte and cent'anni, friends!

Beyond the warm sentiments, the whisky itself here is a delight. The Islay elements are quite forward - loads of peat, soot, and brine, with a savory quality reminiscent of olives and smoked brisket - but there's a playful spice and sweetness running through the whole of the dram, as well. Instead of simply the brooding heft of the typical whisky of this level of peatiness, there's a spritely vivacity. To steal and modify a description from my favorite wine writer, Karen MacNeil, it's like a medieval war hammer...that's been coated in whipped cream. Really a masterful blend, and a must-have for any serious whisky lover."

5.0,"Good lord. Bought this bottle a few months ago and waited until the guy who introduced me to whiskey was having a birthday and I popped it with him. Worth the wait!!
Initial nose is all the Ardbeg. The cork smelled like every Ardbeg I’ve ever had. I like to think I could have picked it out without knowing but before buying this NOT CHEAP bottle I did my research. First taste is almost all citrus, particularly ORANGE, then burnt orange and then more fresh orange. Tons of orange. I’ve had a ton of great fruity scotch and I’ve had even more great peaty and Smokey scotch. The way they make this an amazing version of both is mind boggling. By the end I was nosing orange and no longer had much smoke but then it came back. This is an amazing whiskey. If I can convince my fiancée this is a good investment I’ll probably try to pick one up to hide in the closet for a few years. I look forward to coming back to this on special occasions. It is a very special whiskey"

4.0,"The blizzard/bomb cyclone of 2018 has come and gone. Snow all shoveled. Fire burning. Cold Play on the Alexa. Now time to taste something good and warming.  Hmmm.  Been reading about all the good this whisky brings.  @PBMichiganWolverine contribution to our little group is the chosen one. 

The nose is a lovely briny peat. Maritime sea spray, hickory smoked ham, vanilla, candle stick wax, blueberries and cream, lemon oil. The brined peat dampens over time and becomes sweeter. The other aromas weave their way through. And the potpourri of disparate aromas is quite interesting and lively. 

A deep and concentrated peat arrives with a spicy hot and oily body. Black pepper, some sweetness of vanilla and toffee. Charred BBQ meat.  A flash of honey with a ginger fade.  As it works towards the finish, the formulation of cigar ash begins. 

The finish is cigar ash, black pepper, lemon zest and toffee sweetness.  Long lasting smokiness like having finished a cigar with a little zing (like a CAO Brazilia cigar). 

Once again, Compass Box does it again. The unique aromas, the Islay smoke, spice and sweetness and the balance of flavors is exceptional. John Glaser is the Master Blender. A wonderful whisky to top this blustery evening. [92/100][Tasted: 1/4/18]"
5.0,"Another one of the awesome bonus samples from the SDT group, this one provided by @PBMichiganWolverine. To echo the specifics already laid out by @LeeEvolved this is a malt blend composed of 75.5% Ardbeg, 10.6% Caol Ila, 13.4% Clynelish and .5% of the Compass Box secret ingredient, Dailuaine, Clynelish and Teaninich blended together and aged in French oak. Marketed as the peatiest CBW yet, this is presented in a beautiful and bad ass black accented bottle. Bottled at 48.9% ABV and as all CBW whiskies it is non chill filtered and natural color. This is a pale straw color not unlike its core range cousin, Peat Monster. 

The nose is a little flat at first, but give it more time and it really shows it’s true colors. Of course it’s smoky, but it’s also very floral, much like Peat Monster. It’s also quite fruity with raspberries, strawberries, blackberries and a bit of ripe red apples. A hit of candied bacon, sticky sweet smelling, like coating your fingers in bacon grease and plunging them into a bag of sugar. The Clynelish comes in with a waxy note. Vanilla and cream. The smoke comes back around, but it’s overshadowed by the fruitiness. Polished oak, more floral notes and a little honey with a light lemony citrus. Dark chocolate and sea salt, apricots and a far off rubbery note. 

The palate arrives sweet but quickly turns peppery. Layers of smoke rather than the blast you get from sticking your face over a dying fire like you might expect from the high proportion of Ardbeg. Smoked brisket and over cooked BBQ chicken. Grilled stone fruits than were then chilled in the fridge. Not super complex, but very enjoyable. 

Medium-full bodied mouthfeel. Oily and dry at the same time and a little waxy. 
The finish is medium long, smoky, meaty and dry. 

While I am certain that this is a cut above the Peat Monster, I’m not quite so certain that it’s twice the price better. The overall peat/smoke feel makes it seem like there is a higher percentage of Caol Ila than what’s actually in there. While this may be the peatiest CBW ever, I guess I was expecting something more along the Ardbegian levels of intense peat. Still, it’s very enjoyable and another testament to the blending genius that is John Glaser and the team and Compass Box. A solid 4.5 that I am rounding up to 5 because simply giving it 4 is a disservice. We are all going to have to update our many many ratings once we finally get our half star increments, hint hint @mikael 
Cheers 🥃"
5.0,"I went ahead and added this newest Compass Box release to my little side by side comparison of Peat Monster and Peat Monster Cask Strength.  Why you ask?  Well, because it’s written on the packaging for No Name that this was CBW’s peatiest scotch yet and it was a natural progression up from Peat Monster- that’s why.  So, me being a (humble) scotch connoisseur- it just felt right to have it there.  Thankfully, my brother from another mother- @PBMichiganWolverine, had sent me a sample back in November.

Now, I also have to add that I wasn’t expecting too awful much from this bottle.  I’ve heard all the “peatiest yet, most powerful, blah blah blah” jibber-jabber and thought it was just posturing.  Plus, I’ve had lots and lots of Octomore.
Boy, oh boy...

Let’s start from page one, though.  The ingredient list is quite tantalizing:  75% Ardbeg, 10.5% Caol Ila, 13.5% Clynelish and just under 1% of CBWs base blend (Clynelish, Teaninich and Dailuaine blended together and aged longer in French oak casks).  That’s a big percentage from all the smokiest players on Islay.  I believe CBW even re-charred the casks from those guys and aged the final blend a bit longer.  Impressive stuff.  Guess what, fam?  It delivers.

The nose is flat out amazing.  It took a little while longer than usual for it to really open up, but when it did it told a story like my mama used to read to me when I was a little boy.  The nose builds anticipation like no other Compass Box before it.  It’s floral, smoky as hell and then the candied fruits and red berries appear.  Boy, it really teases you along.  It even disappears briefly before returning sweeter, then smokier, then sweet again.  It’s a real page turner of a scotch.

The palate opens with a smokiness on par with Peat Monster before a lovely fruitiness arrives that’s reminiscent of a certain Lowland distillery.  The floral notes, too.  It forms a delicate balance and never gets ahead of itself, never gets harsh.  I almost don’t believe this whisky is almost 49% ABV, either.  Do Not Add Water To This Whisky.  Or at least wait until after you’ve tried it neat.  It doesn’t need to be cooled a bit.

The finish is medium length but I have to say that this is the juiciest, most mouth watering finish I think I have ever experienced in a scotch, single malt or blend.  It is an amazing achievement.  This is also as close as I think we may ever see Compass Box get to mimicking a peated, port barrel finished whisky.  And my motto is that port and peat play perfectly when paired.  This blend nearly accomplishes that without a port barrel.

In conclusion, this whisky cracked my Top 6 favorite whiskies of all time and is also better than This Is Not A Luxury Whisky.  Which had been my favorite CBW to date.  It’s easily a 5 star dram.  Now I have to just figure out how many of the 15,000 available bottles I need to hoard.  I gotta go, I can hear my credit card whimpering.  What’s $129 times 6?

Find this bottle and experience it for yourself.  It’s worth every penny.  Cheers, my friends."

5.0,"Sweet vanilla cream, smooth peat"
4.0,"Thanks to @PBMichiganWolverine for the sample!  My read on this blended scotch is that my palate isn't really sensitive enough to discern the differences between Ardbeg and Caol Ila at a 7:1 ratio, and certainly not enough to pick out a small proportion of Clynelish's Highland malt when combined with so much assertive Islay scotch.  At the end of the day, this tastes like a slightly more aged version of Ardbeg 10, which it kind of is.  The rumors indicate that the Ardbeg in this bottle was distilled in 2003, which would make this 13- to 14-year old 'Beg.  Its scents are consistent with that rumor, as I experience some crispy smoked pork rinds right out of the gate, then oil and lime (citrus being an Ardbeg signature).  The palate is surprisingly mild -- who knows, I may be saying this because I'd had two other Islay scotches right before this one -- and has more lime than anything else.  The finish is unmistakably Ardbeg:  barbecue smoke and lime, with sweetness on the upswing.  This is not easy to find and priced at $125 or more, but I'm not sure it adds enough to the Ardbeg distillery character to warrant the ask.  The more experienced Compass Box aficionados may be able to pick out notes here that I didn't get.  My sense is that this is a dram for the experienced scotch drinker with a sensitive palate."

4.25,"Aha this I like. The sample I had of Phenomenonly wasn't in balance this however definitely is. Nearly 3% abv higher but the alcohol balances nicely with the flavour without a drop of water being added. Now this isn't the type of Islay I usually go for as I like a richer more viscous spirit e.g. Talisker, Laphroaig. I thought what does this remind me of..ah yeah Ardbeg and then saw GPs note and was like yeah nailed it :-). Lovely vanilla balance with the peat. I like the Revs 'olive brisket' comment. Haven't heard that one before but it nails it. Water gave it a broader rounder flavour but also weakened some components. Now score... its much better value than Phen but at $120 USD I could get a Cory and a Uggie which I'd rate similar. 4.25 to 4.5 I'll give it."

5.0,"I'm a sucker for Compass Box and their beautiful presentation and this one, with it's all-black mysterious outfit, replete with runes and a wax seal sold the inner romantic in me.

Nose: Huge whiff of smoke akin to if you decided to douse the campfire with water at the end of the night because you're a headcase and wouldn't be able to sleep at night if you didn't.  Salty sea-breeze air, tarmac, seaweed, cereal, and hints of lemon/lime trying to poke through...maybe some vanilla.

Palate:  Right off the bat the sweet medicinal notes hit you, band-aids, rubber, tarmac, bigtime liquorice, cacao, citrus notes along the lines of grapefruit, a touch nutty  Mouthfeel isn't big and chewy as would be expected but medium-bodied, velvety and a bit oily.

Finish:  Billowing smoke, leathery, peppery, very salty and huge liquorice in your face.  It reminds me of a certain liquorice that a friend from Sweden sent to me about 10 years ago that I absolutely loved; salmiac liquorice.  Coffee, band-aids...it just keeps going and going.

Upon my first dram of this whisky, I was completely enamored and had to go back to the store to grab another couple bottles because when it's gone, it's gone.  I could sit back and savor a single dram of this for a good hour or two, picking apart all of the nuances.  It's dirty and aggressive yet elegant and sophisticated.  A paradoxical, beautiful blended whisky and at the top of the list of ""Islay-themed"" whiskies that I've ever had the pleasure of tasting."

Taste: PEAT, charcoal, mint, clove, fruit but less than the nose.  

Experience: Having a pinch of dessert after your house has burnt down. 

Honestly this is a hard one to describe, perhaps that is where the ""No Name"" comes from. No Name indeed, no one distillery can claim it (although we are pretty darn sure who was involved), it is hard to get a hold of, and hard to place flavor wise. In the end it earns it's spot amongst the compass box collection and on my self."

5.0,"Wow... @PBMichiganWolverine @LeeEvolved and @Generously_Paul reviewed this well. Great spirit!

I'm more of a smoke over peat kind of guy, and Laphroaig is arguably my favorite distillery, but this is outstanding. In fact I could possibly fool knowledgeable drinkers into thinking this is a bourbon cask aged Springbank.

Picture an Ardbeg 10 that is much more mature, with lemon zest and black pepper. The finish is very long and complex, with ginger and brine lingering. The palate is incredibly smooth, though the body is surprisingly fragile considering the 49% ABV. 

I recommend!"
