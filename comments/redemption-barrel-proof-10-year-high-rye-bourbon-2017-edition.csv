5.0,"Spicy and sweat, add an ice cube or two and it’s great."
4.5,"This is freaking amazing. I have to admit, initially, I wasn't overly impressed. However, it has become well balanced after letting the bottle sit on the shelf for a few weeks. I'm going to buy another bottle. Cheers"
3.5,"Hot and sweet without water, with water it's got a little spice and it's still hot on the lips. Tastey but only if you like that rye fire"
4.0,"Just picked a bottle of this up (6/5/2019), so I'm guessing it's not the 2017 edition; but it's 10yr Barrel Proof High-Rye Bourbon, 114.4 proof.

The nose is classic MGP bourbon - oak, brown sugar, orange peel, baking spices, leather and some varnish (but in a good way). Enough heat to let you know it's barrel proof, but not to the point of being harsh.

Palate follows the nose - brown sugar, oak, and baking spices dominate. There's an earthy quality but not to the point of adding off-notes. Finish is oaky but not astringent, the sweetness lingers along with some rye spice (but none of the herbal/dill notes that I get from MGP straight ryes).

After adding a few drops of water and giving this some time to breathe in the glass, it just got better, with the brown sugar notes becoming more prominent (but without diminishing the oak and spice).

All in all this is a really good example of well-aged MGP bourbon, and at $75 it was a relative bargain compared to similarly aged offerings from other NDP's. Stuff like Boone County and Widow Jane are a few bucks cheaper but also substantially lower in proof. Belle Meade Cask strength can be found for under $70, but it's NAS and obviously younger. Strangely, this was $20 cheaper than the Redemption 9yr low-rye barrel strength on the same shelf."

4.5,"wow, tastes like rye bread. the ryest rye I've ever had."
4.0,"What a great bottle. If u like complexity and something different, this is a great bottle. Its aged well, its smooth, its got a hint of rye whiskey but the richness of bourbon. Its not cheap, but i’m happy i own it because its just different!"
5.0,"I found this bourbon to be an exceptional pour. Classic bourbon nose with hints of red fruit. Great thick mouth feel, the pallet starts with a little sweetness then comes the pepper. Vanilla, caramel, barrel, a touch of apple peal and leather leads to a long peppery finish.  Love it, I made the mistake of bringing it to a family birthday party and just about finished it off! Glad I bought 2!!!"
