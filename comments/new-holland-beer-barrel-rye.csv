1.0,"Just a quick tasting note here. Had this at a friends house tonight. Didn’t really get a chance to nose this one but the palate was something incredibly different, and not in a good way. 

Basically it tasted like menthol cigarettes with some dill. Pine resin and various herbs. Don’t buy this, it’s gross"
