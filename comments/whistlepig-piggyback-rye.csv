3.75,"Very tasty rye - smooth with a good amount of rye spice. Definitely a sipper if you like ryes, almost as good as their 10 year.  And yes, it makes a mean Manhattan!"

4.25,I’ve never been a big Whistle Pig fan until this one. Price is right (44.99) for a 6 year rye. Loving the notes and characteristics of this one
4.0,Still working on my palate so bear with me.  Appearance / Color Amber  Nose  Has definite similarities to the nose of the 10 year rye WhistlePig. It's strong and fresh and distinctly a rye.  Palate Very spicy with a strong rush of cinnamon.   Finish Nice smooth finish with a little bit of vanilla to end it all.  Review Overall this is a really amazing rye whiskey with plenty of legs. Considering the intention of this one to be used by bartenders as a mixer it would definitely make a perfect Manhattan.

3.75,"This is red hots all the way down for me. Some younger ryes that have this characteristic are too sweet and sharp, but this has a nice underlying earthiness below the sweetness. I don't think I'd buy it, but glad I tried it."
3.0,"This is a rough whiskey to sip, specially when compared to the 10 yo, and it's definitely not worth the $50 price point. there are several other ryes that are miles better under 50. I feel that you are paying for the name rather than the actual liquid"
4.0,"cinnamon, spice and everything nice"
3.5,"I find this rye to be just O.K. my impressions are probably not great because I had just tried their 12 y.o. which is very good. at the price point, there are definitely other options with more character depending of the notes you prefer in rye whiskey"

4.5,"Nose: smacks you in the face vanilla followed by spice. The second time around I get fruit. Maybe green apple. Followed by hot tea. 

Palate:  creamy and vanilla followed by rye spice & tea. 

Finish:  Spicy with lingering vanilla 

Score 4.5 out of 5
Easily a solid sipper. 
Well worth the msrp"

3.25,"You know I love rye. 100% rye is notoriously hard to work with. The nose has all that spice I am looking for. The taste is a little sweet, surprising since it’s only 6 years old."
4.0,"I generally think that Whistlepig whiskeys are decently good, but quite overpriced(an $80-$100 whiskey that's worth about $50).  This one actually bucks that trend, in that it is reasonably priced ~$45 and it actually tastes like something should in that range, maybe even like something a bit higher.  
This has a strong, sweet rye nose.  It is spicy with a lot of rye flavor - I get a bit of vanilla, rye grain, some pepper, dry woody notes with some green herbal flavors, and a good amount of heat.  It has a strong rye finish with more wood and some char.  I like this, and I'd buy it again.  This is pretty much what I'm looking for in a solid  mid range rye."
4.25,"Tasted 8/17/19

I know they released to be used in cocktails, but this is a really great rye to sip on as well! It’s a little sweeter than their 10 year and for the msrp this is a must have for any rye whiskey fan."
3.75,"Love Whistle Pig. Their 10 is one of the favorites. 

Nose: Rye Spice, BlackTea, Vanilla, light Honey
Taste: Vanilla, Black Tea, High spice

Unlike the 10 year this 6 year really throws the Tea flavors at you followed by the classic vanilla from the 10 year we all know and love.

Perfect for the price. Highly recommend."

3.0,"This is the new entry level offering Whistlepig. It's a 6yr old 100% rye Mashbill that they source from Canada. The SRP is $50 or about $25-$30 less than the 10 yr. Let's dive into it to see if it's any good:

On the palette it's a little thin but smooth. Initially it's sweet with caramel and bananas with a hint of ginger. Mid palette gets spicy with a lot of pepper and slight cinnamon. Finish is short and a bit sharp with more the pepper note. 

Now it's not a bad Rye. It's easy to drink and smooth until the finish. I would recommend this as more of a cocktail rye versus a neat sipper. $50 for a cocktail Rye is a bit steep in my opinion so I personally would pass on a bottle. Cheers all!"

Nose: Floral sweetness, like wildflowers. Sugared cereal. Faint maple/brown sugar. Fresh barn hay/sawdust/wood shavings.

I picked this bottle up from Michael's Liquor in Suntree for $36 and since then I see it at $50 everywhere else. I'll have to pick up a second. 

There seems to be a sweet cinnamon hint on the nose along with the spice. There is cherry, citrus and brown sugar also. 

The mouth feel is smooth with a nice spice on the front and mid palate. I do not have a hug at the back, but the flavor lasts."

Nice texture.  Not creamy, not thin.  Sweet Apple cider in the tongue. Gosh I like that more than I expected.  The apple, cinnamon, vanilla and rye spices are quite balanced and distinctive.  Legs are decent, mostly the dill leaning rye elements.

I wasn’t expecting to like this as much as I do. I heard this was disappointing neat but I dig those apples.  I think this is delicious!"
3.5,"Dave Pickerell designed Piggyback for bartenders and cocktails in 2018 shortly before his passing. The pig in the logo on the bottle wears a Stetson rather than the typical top hat in honor of Dave. The bottle design is also different from most of the WhistlePig line to make it easier to pour. It has a 100% rye mash bill sourced from WhistlePig’s original source, Alberta Distillery in Calgary. It is aged for 6 years and bottled at 96.56 proof.
PiggyBack has an amber tone and a cinnamon and peppercorn nose. The rye produces a powerful spicy flavor with hints of cocoa. Some woody notes intermingle with the smooth rye as the finish trails with vanilla and spices."

4.5,"Disclaimer: I’m dabbling into the rye world.  I think this might be my fourth ever. In the same way I want to develop my scotch palate in 2020, I want to do the same for rye as well. I’ve heard good things about this company, but I’m generally underwhelmed by rye whiskeys.

Nose has mint leaves and pickle juice. 

Body is fascinating. I get cream, sugar, and chocolate. There are moments where it genuinely reminds me of a cold brew mocha. Something about the mouth feel even tricks you into thinking it’s a creamy liquid. Very good.

Finish is where you’re reminded it’s a rye, and I don’t mean that as an insult. Mild burn on the sides of your tongue, pickle juice flavor.

This is objectively good. I can tell this is a rye, but I like it. Hell, I’m tempted to pour this into my coffee tomorrow morning. Not only would I recommend this as a starter rye whiskey, right now this is my favorite rye. I have farmstock rye sitting right next to this little guy on the shelf, not to mention all the other Whistlepigs I don’t have access to, but for now, I am really happy with this rye."

4.0,Ok so really like the 10 yr. As a 100% rye WP tastes completely different from the standard MGP 95 profile.  This was gifted to me by an awesome co-worker whose hubby is in the liquor biz(much appreciated). Piggyback is obviously a younger version of the vaunted 10 yr and that is not a bad thing. It still carries the wonderful full richness of the 10 but allows for more youthful flavor punch and ethanol heat. This is designed for mixing according to WP but lets face it straight up its still a delight. Notes are similar to my WP10 review with maybe a bit more caramel sweetness and less overall sophistication and complexity but the relation is obvious. Great strategy to put out an affordable entry to draw people into the brand.............89/100..... If you enjoy rye buy this as a budget 10 yr

4.5,"Let's all start with the admission that Whistle Pig is the undisputed Rye king. Every bottle seems to display a mastery the rest of the whiskey world tries to match. PiggyBack is a young rye which might be scary from other distilleries, but this is WP so away we go with not a worry on mind.  Nose is forresty (I realize I made that word up, but tell me I'm wrong). I get flashes of a spring hike through the woods.  Taste is smooth like most Rye is not.  I have no idea how they do this at every proof and age point, but once again WP has made an incredibly drinkable Rye. Flavor is layered of fresh baked goods and light pine.  Banana nut muffins with cinnamon dusting dance into the sunset. Sazerac may get the popular vote, but WP is hands down most likely to succeed."

4.5,"Whistlepig Piggyback 6 Year/Sampled Neat in Glencairn 01/24/20

Nose: COMPLEX. All those great herbaceous Rye notes that I love in plentiful supply. Grapefruit Peel, Clove, Black Licorice, Mint, Pine Sap, Hops, Red Apple, Dill, and Polished Oak. I could nose this one for hours. Floral Notes and Fresh Baked Rye Bread develop. Several mysterious notes that I can't quite pin down. Over time it takes on a Dry and Dusty character. One of the better noses I've experienced recently.  

Neat: Not as complex as the nose, but still lots going on. There is a light Cola-ish sweetness on the entry, but it yields to a slight bitterness reminiscent of a grapefruity dry IPA or slightly bitter coffee tempered with a little cream. Eucalyptus and Sweet Mint paired with Light Oak. The mouthfeel is buttery, almost creamy. After a few sips, Salted Caramel shows up. There is a pleasant Peppery quality throughout that intensifies on the finish, leaving behind a coating of slightly Musty Rye, Dill and Sweet Oak.

Splash: A few drops of water amplifies those late developing Florals on the nose. The palate gets a hint of Cocoa Nibs. In the margins of my notes I've written ""Dr Pepper"", but not sure if that was pre- or post-splash. 

Verdict: Got surprised in the mail yesterday by a pre-paid Visa that was part of a rebate from a recent tire purchase. I had been looking at this one on the shelf for a while and was hesitant to drop $50 on it, but since Yokohama was paying I said ""What the Hell?"". I had come to the conclusion that for me, neat rye consumption was best when the mash bill was in the 51% to 75% range. Those 95/5's that I used to enjoy just weren't in my wheelhouse anymore. This is the exception to that rule. Unbelievably complex with equal parts spice and sweet. I know this was crafted with bartenders and craft cocktails in mind, but I can't imagine mixing this it is so good neat. Makes me wonder about WP's other offerings. Maybe they are worth the price? If you are a rye fan, this one comes with my highest recommendation."

Palate is full of flavor with a nice buttery mouthfeel; an obvious but balanced spice with carmel and cinnamon. An oaky sweetness develops on subsequent sips, really becoming soft on the palate. Finish is short and smooth, much like lower proof whiskeys. Out of all the complex flavors, a rye spice lingers the longest, underscoring the fact that this is a 100% rye whiskey. Overall, a solid whiskey at a decent price that is very drinkable without being too spicy or strong for a rye."
