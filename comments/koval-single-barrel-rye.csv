1.0,Not good. Smells and tastes like an old man's pocket. Old pennies and slightly melted peppermints.

2.0,"Not my style, I suppose.  Smells of leather, metal, and polished wood (or some sort of household cleaner) a reminds me of a dentists office.  Smooth, spicy flavor, with a gentle finish.  Not a lot of subtlety on my palette - the oakiness overpowers everything else."

4.0,"A really nice rye! Spicy rye, caraway, clove, licorice, dill, and acetone on the nose; palate is complex, full of spicy rye, clove, licorice, maple syrup, vanilla, and dill. Easy drinking for a young rye."

5.0,Enjoyed on the rocks..a very smooth and thick tasting rye.  Pleasant caramel and smoke tones through the pallet with a light finish.  Actually pretty awesome...gonna pour another right now!
4.0,"spicy and herbal are balanced and reserved and pleasant. a touch of sweetness on the tail. For a mellower rye, I'm still enjoying this very much."

4.0,The body is soft and gentle. Rye spice is present but not overly sharp. Balanced taste and aroma. An easy and pleasant sipper.

3.0,"I split this sample over two nights to let it breathe but i think i preferred it on initial opening. Ryish woody enthanol, bit of sweetness, hint of cherry and maple syrup. Not bad but wouldn't be reaching for another sample. Nearly $80USD over here in nz"

3.25,"Grainy/herbal like most other Kovals. Smooth leathery taste, but smooth finish"
3.75,Smooth. Delicate clean.
3.75,"Advent Calendar 2018

It was clean; but didn’t taste the rosemary or mint"
2.75,"Spicy and bready, a touch hot"
4.0,"This rye isn’t like most others on the shelf and for once that is a good thing. Lots of caramel and butterscotch up front but still a good rye spice with some wood notes. A great sipping rye that while toned down a bit to sit closer to bourbon, Koval still tastes like rye for a change."
