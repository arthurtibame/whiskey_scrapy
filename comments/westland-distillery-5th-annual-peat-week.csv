5.0,"I'm an admitted Westland fanatic and this is one of the best releases to date. Incredibly well balanced. If you like Speyside scotch, you will love a dram of this baby."

2.0,"Not a typical “peated whisky”. Nose is vegetal Peat, no iodine, salt or fish notes, mild sweetness. Palate starts like a Port Charolette for the first second or two. Then nothing but mild sweetness and peat, zero smoke. A very disappointing dram. It lacks sweetness and depth of flavors and what is a peated whisky without some smoke?"

4.0,"Moderate peat and smoke. Pear, unripe peach, vanilla on the nose. Peat smoke fades a bit off the palate after first sip or two, still there but secondary role. Bright white fruit, vanilla, custard, come forward. Moderate finish."
4.5,"Very light color, a light hay.
Nose: the peat hits you the moment you pour it. Sweeter kelpy peat, hints of cucumber, sweet mint, and salad. A bit barn yard-y.
Taste: Clean malt at first, sliding quickly into barrel spice followed by floral peat. Peat smoke wraps your tongue in a cozy blanket on the finish."
3.75,"Not as good as the regular peated whiskey, but still stands on it's own legs (pun intended). Smells like a clean river stone. Notes of earth, smoked meat and a fresh wood campfire. Enjoyable and complex."
