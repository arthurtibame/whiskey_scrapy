Tout en subtilité.
Je viens de faire une excellente découverte que je n'aurai probablement jamais faite si je n'avais pas eu la chance de rencontrer Yannick, la représentante Bella Vita qui m'a généreusement donné quelques échantillons de ces produits. Je vais certainement en acheter!"

3.0,The smoke is very campfire and not very peaty.
3.75,"Peat well present in the nose, without being pungent but rather sweet and soft. Vanilla, yellow fruit and prunes blend well with the smokiness, with a very pleasant profile. There is also a certain biscuitiness, a sign of youth.
Despite having a not indifferent strength (45ppm), the peat remains gentle on the palate, perhaps a little disturbed by the alcohol present more than necessary (this whisky must be really young). A lot of plum and ripe fruit, anise, spices, a pinch of pepper. A lively and cheerful profile, where peat is more of a glue than a master, which you wouldn't expect given the chosen name. It improves by letting it breathe, with the alcohol retracting and having the peat emerge more, even if it remains a little marked profile.
Not very long finish, of ash and spices."
