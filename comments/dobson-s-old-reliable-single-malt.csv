5.0,"this was the first australian whiskey that made me sit up and go, ""wow ... now there's something"".  the triple-distillation means it is smooth, very smooth.  but there is depth and length underneath that smooth exterior.  when i'm doing tastings, i introduce this dram as plum pudding, stewed fruits and christmas cake - across the nose, palette and finish.  there's vanilla and burnt orange in there as well.  and the finish is powerful as it is long.  some lovely, subtle peat smoke plus some rich colour and berry notes from the shiraz casking.  i have made a pact with myself to always have a bottle of this available."
