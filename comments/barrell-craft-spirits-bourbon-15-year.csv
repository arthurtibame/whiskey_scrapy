5.0,Creamy Spiced Honey and Chocolate notes. Velvet in a Bottle.
3.5,"Balanced, pleasant nose. Nothing sticks out but it's complex and good. After a while it opens up, nuts, salted butter, and cotton candy. Some maple syrup. Splash of fruit, and artificial sweeteners found in vitamins. On the palate, familiar peanut profile. Perhaps less intensely nutty than the 14-year store picks, but of that ilk. Some Flintstones vitamins. Candied Granny Smith apples. Soft finish, but not short. 4/26/19"

4.5,"Nose is complex and powerful with hot cinnamon like spice and singed dark toffee.  Flavor is immense.  Starts with a powerful caramel rush that continues until the finish.  On the end, light notes of mocha and cocoa bean develop, along with medium spice.  Finishes quite dry with lingering spice.  This is an intense powerful whiskey."

5.0,"Well...this is worth every penny. Nose is fruits, baking spice, brown sugar, oak, leather, and tobacco. Pallet is brown sugar, carmel, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Great richness leads to a wonderful pour. Honestly, up there with Promise of Hope and 4R 50 as my favorite bourbon I’ve had. Well done."

5.0,"I’ve had quite a few good bourbons, maybe 3-4 damn good ones, and 2 that I thought were spectacular.  This outdoes all the ones I’ve ever had.  It’s a new offering from the chaps at Barrell, a blend of 15 yr olds from IN, TN and KY.  Imagine walking into a chocolate covered cherry.  That’s what the nose of this is...heavenly cherries dipped in sinfully sweet chocolate.  Taste follows with caramel, cloves, nutmeg, and more cherries.  This is hands down one of the most complex, complete, and exciting bourbons I’ve ever tried.  At $250, it’s not cheap...but was a worthwhile splurge to spend with family over Christmas.  We had a few things open, but this was the only one that finished quickly that evening.  My only regret—-I wished I squirreled away a few more pours for latter.  If you can find it, don’t hesitate to get it right away."
5.0,best bourbon I have had in a long time. I was worried about the 240 price tag but it is fantastic.
5.0,"Vanilla on the nose, very subtle not a lot of heat. Caramel and smooth on the taste, full of flavor but not too much heat.  Can see why this was rated as highly as it is, very good stuff"

5.0,"The nose is strong but not overpowering, with cherry syrup, oak, vanilla, molasses and baking spices, mingling amongst each other. Overall the nose is very creamy and buttery, and cake like. The palate is oak forward and slightly dry, with baking spices and black pepper following it, followed by vanilla, caramel and molasses, with a hint of cherry mixing with the spiciness. The finish is long and creamy and oaky with lasting spiciness while vanilla, caramel and molasses slowly fade. Perfection."

4.5,"Amazing whiskey. Priced higher than I would purchase, but delicious if you can get a taste for a reasonable price."
5.0,"I’ve had so many amazing bourbons. Bucket list bourbons. I takes breaks from barrell and everytime i come back to it I’m shocked how much better this is than most. The nose is so complex i get something different in every pour. It’s nutty, it’s citrus, it’s soft and it’s still bourbon if that makes sense. It’s 106 proof and there is ZERO alcohol on the nose. The pallet is citrus at first, however the more you drink the more you get wood and nuts. If you can find this bourbon do not hesitate to buy it. P.S. smelling the empty glass is the only time i get the “tabacco” smell experts describe. And it’s great."

4.5,Wow. I feel like this is what a mix of Pappy 15 and Four Roses Ltd Single Barrel 2014 would end up as. An ancient pine forest with a strong lingering finish. Hats off.

4.25,"Carmel, blackberry, smoke on the back end"
4.75,"Excellent stuff. Nuanced and refined throughout. Amazing mouthfeel and finish. Spice, cherry, cola...and just a hint of minerality."
5.0,"2019 release

Nose: caramel, citrus, vanilla, cherries and herbs

Taste:  fruit jumps out first with little burn. Orange zest, cherry pie, leather and vanilla. Slightly tart. The longer it sits in your mouth the more it ebbs and flows between these different flavors. Great mouthfeel. 

Water brings the fruit forward on the nose and the leather, fruit, cherry pie and wood out on the taste

Finish:  slow building heat that’s never overpowering punches through the fruitiness of the taste and eventually fades into cinnamon and then spearmint that lingers for several minutes. The minty, menthol finish is the most defining note of this pour.

Opened my bottle ASAP to see if I wanted to stock up on this. It’s a good pour but I will not be going back for more at this cost

**Edited review after bottle was open for 2 weeks. The menthol finish isn’t quite as intense and seems more balanced with the spice and cherry. Bumped rating up .25. This is growing on me. 

**3rd edit- once the bottle had time to breathe (3 months) the menthol characteristics have a faded substantially and I’m left with waves of Rye Spice, citrus, peppercorns and cherry that come and go and come again in the finish. I said I wouldn’t buy more...and that was a lie... 15004 bottles made, but only 15000 available to the rest of you fools at the moment. I never want to be without this and I will buy this bottle at every available opportunity if the price is right."
