3.0,This stuff isn't great for sipping..but it can be done without too much remorse. It actually is pretty darn smooth and sweet. Bit of a bitter aftertaste.Basically no depth of flavor..BUT it's $9 for a fifth and it mixes very well. 2 stars for flavor + 1 more for the price.

4.25,Best mixing whiskey.
2.0,"Appearance: The color in this blended American is burnished bronze. Its legs are thin and semi viscous, slowly easing their way down the glass.

Nose: On the nose it’s more harsh overall, but there are notes that make it not all offensive. Notes I detect are corn, sharp low quality tequila or moonshine, Sharpie permanent marker, stale cotton candy, and I get a smell reminiscent of the school where I work’s art room.

Taste: The palate is actually not too bad, but there’s not much there either. Notes of oak, cherry, Twizzler candy, and a curious smoky note round out the thin palate.

Finish: The finish is quick and leaves a raspberry-like note in aftertaste.

Thoughts: For a whiskey in this category, this is not a terrible dram. If I needed a cheap mixer this would be a solid choice. Now compared to most other straight whiskies, this wouldn’t stand up to much, but I’m glad I tried it and understand it’s being the #2 best selling blended American whiskey. Thanks, Kessler! Cheers!"
4.0,"Kessler has a chestnut color. Aroma is of caramel, candy sugar, wood, and nut oil. Maybe, florals, too. Taste is of those elements, with a very strong wood flavor. Some nectar. Mouthfeel is high medium, and Kessler had a moderate finish. RJT"
3.0,great for blending with Pepsi.
1.0,"My first whiskey. Not a great first impression. Thankfully I learned that things could only go up from here. Strong ethanol nose and flavor. Tastes minimally of burnt nuts and vanilla with a lingering, bitter finish."
