This is lovely, some Dickel minerality that I enjoy, and tons of gentle fruitcake spice, glazed donut, dried cherries, full and rich, extremely well balanced"

4.25,Complex flavor - one of my favorites.
4.25,"Barrel K772 | 14 years | 95.52 proof

The CBRC “shopping spree” pick. Extremely enjoyable glass of bourbon. One of the smoothest barrel proofs (albeit low proof) I’ve tasted to date. 

Load of cinnamon and burnt honey, slight stone fruit on the nose.

Palate is similar with the addition of a little oak, banana and a little pipe tobacco / vanilla sweetness to it.

Finishes nice although short, makes me want more and more."

4.0,"It has the characteristics you will find on a single barrel bourbon, nose is sweet cinnamon bit of oak and alcohol. Taste, sweet and salty, some wood and spice. The finish medium long, bitter and spice a little burn."
