null,"A nose of vanilla and caramel is followed by dried fruits, oak, and just the right amount of peaty smoke, finishing with dark chocolate.  Really a lovely dram if you can find it!"

3.0,"Unusual and quite unique. 

Maybe the first time I come across a whisky that evokes thoughts of Champagne - the nose is winey with citrus zest. The palate has notes of honey and ginger, but the finish is non-existent. 

Not bad."
