4.0,"Quick hit: Local whisky tasting in Glen Cairn.  

Soft Sweet fruity nose.  Plumbs, blueberry or black cherry, Butterscotch , caramel.  

Gentle sweet arrival that immediately turns cinnamon spicy.  A flash of red hots that settles down to ground cinnamon.  Then turns sweet with vanilla, apples, pears and honey. 

Tingly long but the sweet flavors fade fast.  Vanilla, oak spice. [Tasted: 3/6/19]"

3.0,"Un nez très présent, qui prend vraiment les narines. Sucré mais surtout alcoolisé.
L'attaque est très alcoolisée, trop : c'est trop fort, ça écrase les arômes.
En bouche, ça enveloppe bien et c'est sucré ; difficile de distinguer beaucoup plus.
La finale est longue et agréable mais pas inoubliable."

4.25,"They say a sample sometimes doesn't do justice and you need to work your way through a bottle to really let it reveal itself but I often have the opposite problem in that I love a sample and then buy a bottle and it just doesn't measure up. I loved the sample of the 13, bought a bottle and it never hit the peak I remember. It could be a number of factors but maybe it's like your first time of any unique experience, subsequent tastings just don't hit your memory of the greatness, the element of surprise being lost, replaced instead by expectation of a high benchmark it should meet. This theory was reinforced when I shared with friends and one of them rated it how I once initially did despite me being by then a bit meh. The 17 is how I remember the 13 to be in a way. I rated the 13 a 4.25 but now just pushing 3.75 on a good day. This shoots to 4.25 with it's warm, honey sulphurous taste. Having tried both before and after the 13 seems quite flat, a shadowy variant lacking the vibrant viscosity and retaining the sulphuric note which now seems a bit naked, exposed and unbalanced. I'd love to swap my bottle of the 13 for a 17 but it's not available in NZ and probably a good thing as my personal experience may repeat itself yet again."

4.0,"I had a pour of this last night during a tasting hosted by Craigellechie.  This was part of the lottery for the 51 yr old tasting, which 150 people around the world got a chance to try.  Fortunately @Scott_E was one of them, and I’m thankful I was his guest for the event.  

So...at the time I really liked this one.  It was a more refined smoother version of the 13.  Sort of Pierce Brosnan’s Bond as opposed to Daniel Craig’s rough and rugged one.  In retrospect though, I prefer the 13 for that rough edge.  To me, it’s always commonplace to find smooth balanced single malts, but so much harder to find rough, and really well balanced, ones.  

That being said...this was damn good.  The meaty notes were less pronounced vs the 13, the sulfurous edges smoothed out a bit.  I’m glad I tasted this, but I’ll be a buyer of the 13, just for that ruggedness."

4.0,"Distiller gave this expression one more point than the 23. So did a few people in the comment section on MofM.
Well, i'm afraid i have to differ here. Ok, this 17yo is good, special, different from other malts around and in this case a great bottle to reach for when looking for an easy sipper, but in no way could i compare it to the powerful 23 where everything is fruitier, juicier, more complex, well, better...much better imho.

still i give this one a solid 4"
3.0,"Really ripe and sour fruits. I was afraid at first that this is just another honey juice but it goes a lot further. If you give it some time there is a fresh parsley smell and then peaches. Not overly sweet on the nose. 

Herbs and spices and on the palate along with a brown rock candy sweetness and a fresh hotness. A bid of sweet licorice.

Nice."
