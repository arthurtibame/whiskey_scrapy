3.75,"Color - copper brown. A quick swirl shows sparse legs in the glass

Nose - maple syrup, vanilla, varnished oak

Palate - maple, caramel and baking spices, with a fairly rich mouthfeel for the proof.

Finish - pretty quick, some lingering spice but more subdued than I usually get from OF

A few drops of water muted the maple/oak  on the nose but brought out a hint of dark stone fruit and more vanilla.  On the palate, the water brought out more sweetness, with the caramel coming to the front and lingering a bit on the finish.  I liked this both ways, although I think the nose was better neat.

I'm not really a huge OF fan. I like Statesmen and 1920 OK, but not nearly as much as other brands. To me this 1910 is a bit darker/richer, with the spice softened a bit compared to other OF expressions. For  me that's a good thing. People who love 1920 probably won't like it as much due to its lower proof and lacking that bright/spicy character."
4.0,"Nose (3.75):  Brown sugar and plums.  Slightly ethanol for proof but dissipated quickly.  Sweeter than the 1920.

Palate (4.5):  Burnt brown sugar, raisins with some carmel and vanilla underlying.  Very good sipping neat might not hold up as well in mixed drink.  

Finish (3.75):  Plumbs and sugar and then the heat comes in.  Kind of cinnampn-apple.  Finish is quicker with good aftertaste.  Higher proof may have sustained finish but all in all petty pleasing.

If you like Statesman this has similar profile with nicer nose and a bit richer.  I like it dead even with the 1920."
4.0,"I WISH it was higher proof, but it is good juice. Not up to snuff of 1920, but definitely has a unique richness; raisins, plum, and toasted marshmallow. Pleasant nose."

4.0,"Grabbed a bottle from the distillery this week on a trip through KY. Big fan of 1920, so I was eager to see how it stacks up. Lots of indistinct baked-good flavors to pick over. I keep coming back to Irish soda bread (raisins!). It's not all dessert though, there are ripples of that heavily charred oak which I'm guessing will be a turn off for some, and probably also why they dialed back the proof. All in all it's its own thing, and worth the price of admission."

The palate doesn’t let you down. Sweet but not overly.  Oaky but just enough.  Smooth.  

Finish. Enough of a finish to keep you around which is saying something for a “lowish” 93 proof.

Altogether amazing.  Immediately one of my favorites."

3.75,"Verdict:  A unique and incredible bourbon.  Overwhelmingly sweet while also wholly defined by pervasive and astringent barrel char.  Jekyll and Hyde.  Underwhelming nose.  Definitely a ""must try"" but won't be for everybody.  A tad pricey.
 
A dark, rich amber.  Oily with slow legs.  Spiced cherry, vanillin, unripened fruit, and a gentle but persistent wood char on the nose.  Burnt sugar and cream with a subdued mint and some medicinal notes.  Complex, but not quite alluring.  The sweetness requires teasing out from behind the stronger, semi-acrid scents.
 
Where the nose earns mixed reviews, the palate wows with sweetness.  An immediate rush of toffee and sweetened black tea.  Creme brulee.  Blackened mashmallow.  Caramel swirled with cinnamon.  The rush of sweet fades slowly into very strong barrel notes, somewhat bitter with char and cinnamon candy spice.  The drying astringency lasts forever on the finish, hardly fading before the next taste."

Smokey flavor takes over, which is nice at first but the smoke really dominates.  There’s no big finish which is a little disappointing considering how interestingly this bourbon starts out. 

I bought this for $48 at a big liquor store. It’s worth it to me at that price because I find it a unique arrow in the flavor quiver.  However, I don’t consider this a super-frequent sipper because the smoke is so dominant.

If you’re a collector like me, throw it on the bar. You’ll like having it to dip into!"

Finish: it ends sweet and dry. The dryness is most likely a  byproduct of the second heavily charred barrel the whiskey is finished in.

Taste - Sweet toffee, very drying initial mouthfeel, sweet oak, chocolate, brown simple syrup, hint of sweet leather, maple syrup, espresso crema

Finish - Sweet toffee, sweet mocha, tiny bit of heat/tingle, maple syrup, leather

Score - 86/100

Final Thoughts - I quite liked this one as it hit on at least 2 or 3 of things I like together which is chocolate, coffee, & maple syrup. This is definitely on the sweeter end of the spectrum, very similar to Woodford Reserve Double Oaked and I would treat this as more of a dessert dram than a daily drinking dram. Nice chocolate & gentle coffee/mocha notes throughout. Doesn't really drink like the proof and is overall quite tasty.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes

Would I buy a bottle? - Yes if it's around the same price as Woodford Reserve Double Oaked"

4.25,"This is a superb drink, with one of the chewier, thicker mouthfeels I've been able to find.

The initial burst is vanilla toffee or rich caramel. Oaky and lightly sweet underneath. There is a cinnabon (cinnamon roll/ bun) quality to this that really captures both the richness of cream cheese frosting and pastry all at once. 

UPON REVISITING
I am revisiting this some weeks later, after the bottle has had a chance to open up some.  My initial quality rating remains unchanged, but the flavor nuances are different.  This is much softer and more mellow than I remember, still rich, with a soft cocoa with marshmallow foam quality to it."

Going back a few minutes later.  A delicious toasted marshmallow on the nose now too.   Reminds me of a Woodford Double Oak the more it opens up.

Thin, watery texture.  Brown sugary initially.  Cherry and berries.  Vanilla. Wood flavors.  Bitter, burnt coffee.

The nose is sweet with vanilla, and brown sugar dominating. A slight leathery note pokes through.
The palate is sweet with a follow through from the nose, but added leather and very oaky. 
The finish has a slight bitterness and a little ethanol. But I would consider this a longer finish.
I really enjoyed this one. Definitely reminds me of the Woodford Double Oaked, which makes sense, since this one was also put into a second charred oak barrel.
I need to do a side-by-side comparison with 1910 and 1920 and then one between 1910 and Woodford DO."

4.0,"The nose on this is a pretty complex array; campfire smoke, charcoal, leather, molasses, cola, overripe black cherry, banana, and mahogany wood.

These aromas are all present in the palate, with the addition of creme brûlée, milk chocolate, and nougat. The finish is where this really excels with notes of cashew nut, barrel spices, black cherry cola, oak, and toasted marshmallow. You do wish for it to go a little longer as it’s merely medium length. Mouthfeel on the lighter side. 

A delightful whiskey. But...(yes there’s a but) it does suffer a bit from a lack of punch due the lower proof. I would KILL for this at 107-110 proof. As it is, it’s a great dessert whiskey and worth the $58 price point anytime."
3.5,"What it is:
Very warm with a smoky nose.  Very spicy and smoky on the pallet with dried savory fruits ( figs, currants).  Creamy with a thick mouth feel.  Ethonol heavy finish with a lingering smoke after taste.  Very smooth and easy, with interesting flavors all the way.

What it isn't:
Sweet.
Floral
Like any Old Forester I have ever had.(I generally love OF bottles)
Easy to find.
Worthy of all the hype and demand (IMO).
My favorite of the Whiskey Row series.

This pour is good, but leaves me wondering why the much better OF 1920 is on shelves and readily available, and this is almost at unicorn status???

It's worth trying, buying, savoring, and sharing...but not chasing.  There are many $55 bottles that I prefer."

4.0,"Unique flavor with minimum spice. Very easy drinker and one of my favorite that I have picked up. Was hesitant due to the bottle I got being the re-release, but glad I decided to take it home!"
3.5,"This is a good example of a Bourbon that you need some time with to really figure out how one feels about it! I am about half way thru a bottle and feel that it's finally hit it's stride. Before we jump into the notes let's review what's in the bottle:

Mash Bill: 72% Corn, 18% Rye, 10% Malted Barley
Cask: New Charred oak and finished in heavily charred oak barrels
Age: 4+ Years
ABV: 46.5%

Let's dive into the tasting:

It's a very rich entry with dark red fruits, rich syrup, spice and some tannic oak. Nuts and vanilla on the mid palette with a medium oak and red fruit driven finish that's a bitt astringent. 

So my main issue was initially it was a bit too rich and astringent for me. Not fully balanced and honestly I felt it was overrated. As I have spent time with the bottle it's mellowed a bit and now I feel it's an enjoyable occasional after dinner dram. For the price point I would probably re buy it but for me it's not a must have. 

Cheers all!"

3.5,"I had this at a bar a while back and have been hunting with no luck for a while. Finally grabbed a bottle. 

1910 is a double oaked whisky which gives it a bit more of a chocolate, savory, creme brulee thing and it seems to do this often. Woodford double oaked being the gold standard of this. Though my all time favorite bourbon was the jefferson 16 year double oaked (12 years then 4 years). That is one I wish I could have found a second bottle. Anyway comes in at 46.5% which is a bit light for bourbon and then oddly uses this ""Old Fine Whisky"" statement and then on the neck it tells us something about being the first bottled in bond (of course this isn't bottled in bond). OK so Old Forester is the worst company of respected bourbon makers when it comes to marketing. I'm not joking, had I not been told about this, I'd have never bought this with how bad this marketing really is.

Nose - This is sweet. I get dusty old leather, over ripe almost rotting apple, some orchard spice, maybe even some old books, and just a never ending sweet vanilla that's shining all the way through.

Taste - my first though it watered down woodford double oaked. I get a creamy note that really opens the whole whisky up. It's like a bourbon cream flavor in a bourbon vs the other way around. It seems to be almost a vanilla forward oak cream if that makes any sense. Some dusty leather and wood. The finish gives me creme brulee elements that burnt vanilla. 

Just a quick note on this - this is a sipper for SMALL pours. Too much and the sweetness over powers and it starts to get off putting. I don't get that same issue with woodford double oaked so perhaps this is sweeter or more heavy in flavor. I'm not sure why but I had a large pour last night and I was debating blending or just capping it for tomorrow. That shouldn't stop anyone from buying this in bulk if they can. It's outstanding bourbon and one I hope to never be without. 

A rare 3.5 star rating on a bourbon that retails for about 50 bucks. I'm debating a 4 but the mouth feel is too thin for that."

4.25,"The nose is very sweet and playful. I pick up vanilla, butter scotch, and something like raspberries are good old fashion red Kool-Aid. If I sniff on I feel like I detect just a bit of oak as well as a warm pipe smoke aroma like black Cavendish. I don’t get a lot of spice. Others have said toasted marshmallow which I can see that I don’t think you’ll be my first guess.

The precipitous moved on the pallet and I feel like raspberries and caramel come through. There’s a bit of baking spice to it but it doesn’t seem to predominate. In a lot of ways he reminds me of a softer version of old Forrester 1920 and it’s complex but just without the heat and spice of its higher proof brother.  I think the only thing lacking would be just a little bit more smoke or char. Otherwise this is excellent."

4.25,"This year for the holidays I’m going to try a brand new whiskey every day in December. #lifegoals

Dec. 30

I tried to make today’s entry for Jim Beam Peach. As I was attempting to create the spirit, Distiller crashed. I tried a few times after, and the system couldn’t or wouldn’t process it. I’m going to take that as a sign that I shouldn’t submit the review. Pretty sure I compared it to goat sacrifice at some point. Probably for the best.

Anyway, this is a bourbon I’ve been looking forward to for some time. Used to be super hard to find in my region, no longer is. I’ve never had any Old Forrester products, so I’m excited about that too! If this is good, I’ll have to dip more into the other numbers. Let’s see how fine this little guy really is.

Nose reminds me heavily of Booker’s, and I mean that as a compliment. There’s oak, vanilla, honey. There’s a little something extra there that I can’t place, but I’m pretty sure it’ll be a flavor on the body and then make sense to my nose.

Holy cow this body. So that scent on the nose was strawberries, because that is on this body, and detecting that as a whiskey note is a personal first for me. I love it when that happens. Other flavors include honey, cane sugar, and possibly watermelon, but that strawberry really takes the show. That is fascinating.

After a rockstar nose and body, the finish is a bit of a let down. A bitterness enters that knocks you back to reality after a really sweet body. There is a bit of an aftertaste that reminds me of something from Elijah Craig—something that quite frankly turned me off from the product line for over a year now. Black licorice maybe? Even if it’s a letdown, I’ll allow it. That body is so good and unique to anything I’ve ever had on a bourbon, that I’ll suffer through some nasty ass black jellybeans at the end. This tastes like a cousin of Hotel Tango Bravo. I wouldn’t be surprised if they had similar mash bills and yeast strains, and if you’re a fan of one, you should try the other. I’ll have to have them back to back one day, but from memory, I think I slightly prefer Hotel Tango. That licorice or whatever is potent.

‘Tis the season. I DO have 1 more new whiskey lined up. Thanks St. Nick!"

3.0,"Old foresters attempt at double oak. Neat backstory (#1) too bad there isn't one so which one is real? Was there a fire on the bottling line and the whiskey had to be held in a second set of new char oak until it could be bottled? or Did Brown of Brown-Forman simply want darker, richer, ultra aged barrels of the best Old Forester had to offer? John Fitzgerald rip off (the $2K 350ml one). This one is not as good to me as the 1920 or the lower floor single barrel store picks that ironically taste like sweeter better versions of 1910.  Nose is classic bourbon. Caramel, vanilla, brown sugar, oak, cherry, sweetness in the back. Taste is Oak, brown sugar sweetness, maraschino cherry, mid palate the rye spice and a tobacco note roll in and set up camp through the finish along with that double oak quality. The totality of the finish is I'd say medium. For almost the same price I'd pick up the 1920 and for $10 less I'd grab a store pick if you can. It's better than average but it's an elijah craig profile and flavors with extra oak. 3.75 bourbon if this was $35-40"

-Palette and Finish: very smooth and light. A little sweetness carried through from the bananas and vanilla ice cream greet you with cinnamon that carries you into the finish. I had hoped for a more bold flavor, but at this proof I’m not surprised at how light it truly is on the palette. However, the finish lasts pretty long and even though the lower proof makes for a lack of boldness, this long finish has such a delightful flavor of cinnamon and barrel spices. 

The proof is lower and doesn’t bring much heat or boldness, but the flavor profiles are pleasant and long lasting. 
I would say that drinking this without getting the scent profile would be a missed opportunity to add a necessary part of enjoying this bourbon."

4.5,"The hardest to find of the Whiskey Row series, I managed to pick one of these up in January just as they were opening a case. Because there are limited double maturation bourbon products on the market, I was very interested to try this in light of the Woodford Reserve Double Oaked store pick I got last year.

The nose is dense with oak sweetness: vanilla, brown sugar, buttery caramel, bread pudding, and cinnamon. Surprisingly I don't get any fruit notes. It smells higher than its proof, likely due to the strong oak influence. The cinnamon/bread pudding notes hit harder on the tongue. Of course the oak and rye spice are still present. It is really sweet, but very delicious. The finish is medium, and is not overtly tannic from the oak. I see some reviews mention a medicinal quality, I get none of that. This bourbon is defined by oak and sugar. For me it is the quintessential ""dessert whiskey."" I really enjoy one or two glasses, but after that the sweetness is overwhelming. 

This is a bourbon I could drink all day, and is sweet and drinkable enough to introduce friends to more complex and expensive bourbons. It is $2 less and better than Woodford Reserve Double Oaked, but much harder to find in NC. I like this a lot, but I personally wouldn't recommend going out of your way to buy this if you haven't tried the Woodford first. Try that, see if you like the profile, then look for this. I think Woodford was more bready and less sweet, and overall I think this has a more enjoyable profile. But that was a store pick so my opinion is muddled."

2.5,"Decently sweet on the nose, surprisingly hot on initial sip, but calmed down after first sip. Not as flavorful as I hoped. Tasted at a friends place, probably wouldn’t buy myself"

3.75,Classic bourbon flavor. Unique aftertaste that I honestly like. Reminds me of firework smoke in a good way. Buy it.
