2.5,Meh
3.25,Honey and vanilla with intense spice build up that suddenly backs off before pushing you over the cliff edge. Oily in mouth. Long spice and burn in back end.
null,"Not many more samples to go, several in fact, and then my tour winds down. Unfortunately I botched my first Longmorn as a few drops turned into a torrent when I was to lazy and used the tap (don't worry I have a .5 micron whole house carbon block filter so not a drop of anything but pure h20 touches my precious whiskey :-) ). Hard to judge something that has been over watered, bit like rating a catcus on how it performs living in a fish tank. Still it was an interesting experiment and I didn't completely tip it over the edge. Also they do say that some tasters bring the abv down to 30% to get all the nuances out so one could say I'm strictly following protocol. Ah who am I kidding....more whiskey flavoured water than whiskey. Still lovely vanilla, honey and no bitterness to be had  (not sure if that is a side affect of over watering). Prob would have been a 3.5."
