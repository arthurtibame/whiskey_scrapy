3.0,"I live down the street from the OYO distillery and as a whiskey nut, wanted to love the stuff.  The price is a little difficult to handle, but such is craft whiskey these days.    

Compared to its local competitors; Watershed and Mill Street, I found the OYO to be strangely sweet (perhaps pralines) on the nose, and not that interesting on the tongue.   It's almost like the spirit is influenced by their vanilla/honey flavored vodka they produce at the same site.  I prefer Mill Street 100% corn bourbon to OYO's product.    It also costs $12.50 less."

I would give this a high 3. Nose is just right, some spike of alcohol wafts beyond the sweet caramel and the aged oak scents. The palate is very strong oak with bourbon laced. It's almost as if the oak was squeezed out into the bottle with the liquor. Caramel and mild fruit, sweet grains and barrel. Just a bit stiff."

Very smooth in the mouth.
Swallowing has little burn.
Taste sweet while in mouth.
After taste is sweet and burn dissipates quickly."

3.0,"Nose is brown sugar with hints of oak. Palette has some oaks and the notes of the wheat whiskey also spice. The bourbon notes add nice bite and tones over the wheat whiskey. Pleasant burn on the finish. 

I'm not a fan of the wheat whiskey so this was a pleasant surprise.

While not the first thing on my purchase again list I might throw down for this in the future."
