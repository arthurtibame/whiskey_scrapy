1.0,"nose: oak and vanilla. there not rly much going on here.

taste: very hint of vanilla, black pepper, and very strong ethanol forward. 

I would not recommend this to drink straight, it makes an okish mixer with soda or your favorite juice. The only draw back i find with it is the price. I pay around 21 dollars for 750ml bottle. I can get an 1lt bottle of kessler's for the same price. kessler's taste and mixs about the same."
