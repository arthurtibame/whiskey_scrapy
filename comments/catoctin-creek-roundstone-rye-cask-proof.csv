2.75,"A lot of raw wood and grain in this one. If this was older and in a big boy barrel and not a small one, it could really be amazing. As it is, it's way over priced. Lots of potential but not nearly worth the price"
2.75,reminds me of finished whiskey. The small barrel hurts it. Almost syrupy fruity cherry medicine maple syrup notes. I personally am finding the syrupyness unpleasant. Spice and earthy tones still bright. I love 100% rye generally but this one I would not recommend for the price
