3.0,"A friend of mine really likes this one, so I had plenty chances to try it out. Definitely not a bad whisky, just not really my cup of tea.
Nice light-amber/gold colour. Smell is fresh, light and sweet. On the pallette some sweet tones: vanilla, brown sugar. With fruity tones: apple, pear. Decent all around whisky, but noting special. 2.9 out of 5"
5.0,"I won’t go into the tasting notes but this was my first foray into the world of scotch, went to a friends house to drink now and then and went looking in his liquor cabinet and pulled out a dusty box of Chivas 12. Being a bourbon man I had no idea what scotch was or what to expect. I poured a glass over some rocks and was pleasantly surprised! It wasn’t bad at all and I actually enjoyed it. Now having experienced other scotches and single malts I’ll say Chivas 12 is over priced for what it is and I’d spend a extra 10 bucks for a single malt. Just my 2 cents. Also I caught this on sale and decided to pick it up for old times sake so that’s says something else"

The finish has a little more pepper and peat, with some bitterness poking through. A whiff of tobacco from the empty glass. Slightly better than I remember, but pretty much the definition of ""2 star scotch""."

3.0,"Color: The color on this blended scotch is a nice straw color. The legs are thin, but hold on for a bit.

Nose: The nose starts off the show with red apple sweetness, honey, and a hint of briny peat. 

Taste: The palate is very pleasant with honey notes, a salted almond taste, with a note of vanilla as well.

Finish: The finish is a mellow crescendo that grows into a salty and slightly smoky apex and then fades into a shortish finale.

Thoughts: This for me was a really good blend. I'm really happy I picked this up and I think many people would enjoy this. It's really popular so it isn't hard to find! Could you get something better for the price? Probably. But this is good, and definitely worth trying. Sláinte!"

It ticks the boxes for middle of the road, good-not-great, easy drinking blended scotch - fresh apple, vanilla, honey, light smoke, hung on a slightly oily, full-but-not-rich frame. I’m never going to crave this, but at a bar with limited options for the whisky aficionado, I’d take this over plenty of other similarly priced options."

1.25,"Seriously underwhelmed by what is supposed to be such a renowned whisky. That said I'm no expert and I don't drink blended whisky normally (single malt all the way it seems) so take this review with a massive grain of salt - basically a himalayan salt rock lamp . In summary the whisky felt bland and lifeless with a just a hint of sweetness. Absolutely unremarkable. Bought some coke (the dull kind) that I plan on drowning it with so my friends can drink it. Feels like heresy but it's just not for me and I personally can't find even a hint of character worth preserving. Really strange, must just be that my pallet is not adjusted correctly for blended whisky. I hope I revisit this whisky in a few years and discover that I've become more sensitive to its flavour."

Taste certainly does not last long or deliver a heavy punch though. Not complex. Ok but nothing to write home about. Almost weak overall and tastes slightly watered down at times.

2.25,"I had this idea that I would try a few budget drams to see how my taste buds have evolved over the years. After 2 back-to-back budget blended Scotches (the other review will be up in a bit), I may throw in the towel and self-certify that my taste buds are calibrated and working correctly. Let’s get to the tasting notes for Chivas Regal 12 Year Old Blended Scotch. 

Nose: Thin and fruity, and not particularly complex. Green apple, Riesling, vanilla, and suggestions of old oak.  Hidden, dull fireplace smoke. 

Palate: Light, with a thin, watery mouthfeel. Vanilla, caramel, and cream with a dash of mild mannered salt. I think there’s some fruitiness to this but it’s lost in the apparent torrent of fire hydrant testing water used to cut this down to proof. 

Finish: Short and fairly one-note. Sweet, with faint oak tannins, bitterness, and tame spice. Over before you know it. 

I’m finding that few drams work at 40% ABV for me these days and this is no exception. Really unremarkable and boring. In hindsight, my rating appears a bit polite, but it has an age statement and doesn't have any obvious off-notes that completely turn me off from it. I think you could probably use this a mixer, but personally, I wouldn’t.

2.5,"Clearly blended. I couldn’t pin down a particular region it’s from. It’s light, a little smoky on the nose, had some citrus and floral notes. Overall just sweet. I would drink it, it’s far better than the Dewer’s White, but didn’t think it was anything special in a blind tasting."

3.5,"It's unfortunate how many scotch snobs will look down their nose at Chivas Regal, or just blended scotches in general, as I think they offer a whisky with a lot of flavor and an age statement at a good price point. 

The nose is rich with aromas of apples, cola, and spice.

On the palate you get flowers, apples, raisins, and cinnamon.

Finish is smooth with flavors of grain whisky and walnuts.

While the flavor isn't complex, it is rich and enjoyable. Chivas 12 holds their own at a very competitive price point for scotches, and no matter how much I enjoy my single malts I hope I never become too much of a snob to turn down a glass of this enjoyable whisky.


Currently you can find this bottle in a gift pack with 50 ml bottles of Chivas 18 and Extra, which makes this an even better value and lets you try two other delicious blends."

2.5,"It looks a pale amber, light gold.

I'm met first by scents of vanilla, toffee, and caramel; underneath, I find apple and citrus.

Frankly, the taste is pretty flat. There's a big punch of peat and spice up front, and not much to discover after that.

I'd choose it over Dewar's White Label, but it just seems like heat with no real depth."

2.0,"Olfato: muito frutado, mel, baunilha, álcool de cereais, cítrico, floral leve e aroma adocicado. 

Paladar: baunilha, cítrico, adocicado e um pouco de mel. O álcool ainda é perceptível. Basicamente as mesmas características detectadas no aroma.

Finalização: curta, com retrogosto adocicado.

Impressões gerais: whisky simples, não turfado e bastante adocicado. Recomendado para coquetéis ou para degustação com gelo, mas não puro ou com água. Facilmente encontrado no Brasil, este blend pode agradar muitos bebedores iniciantes, porém é possível comprar um bom single malt por um preço similar."

3.0,"On the nose a lot of cereal, vanilla, caramel and a hint of dried fruit, with a clear acidulous note that disappears with a little patience: overall sweet, but not really pleasant.
In the mouth things improve, the biscuit and sweet profile remains, softer than the smell, always accompanied by dried fruit and vanilla with an addition of plums and honey, together with a certain dryness on the background. Simple, linear, clean.
The finish is short, dry, with plums and dried fruit, vaguely acidic like the initial smell."

3.0,"Nose: light floral toffee. Vanilla, almond, with a sherry solvent note in the background. Light but overall pleasant.

Taste: praline, candied almond. Dark fruit and pear lurking in their somewhere. Finishes with dried dark fruit and a slight hint of sherried peat. No detectable hint of anything that screams “grain whisky” to me like in some blends, though I know they’re there.

Smooth, yes, but uninteresting."

2.75,"I gave this Scotch a try after a friend recommended it to me as an entry-level Scotch. Well, I have to say I think his taste is different from mine. I have had only a few Scotches so I have fewer examples of good and bad liquids. Chivas Regal has a medicinal flavor maybe Iodine with a woody finish. It is not pleasant sipping it neat and ice helps it a little but nothing like a Bottled in Bond Bourbon. I am open to suggestions for other entry-level Scotches but this good for mixing at best but a serious drink is not me."

2.25,"Nose: Honey, floral, and a hint of vanilla. Very sweet. Slightly oaky as well.

Palate: Stronger than I thought but very smooth. Honey comes through a lot stronger with a seemingly tropical fruit taste as well. Floral is hidden but comes through just as it reaches the throat.

Finish: Oaky finish as I expected from the nose. But sweet and smooth to be sure. Lasting and enjoyable. I was expecting bitterness but I was pleasantly surprised. May be due to the fact that it was bottled in 2012 but I could be wrong.

Overall Thoughts: Good stuff. Easy to enjoy while putting your feet up and winding down. Wouldn’t say it’s top shelf or anything."
1.75,"The flavor here is fuller then that of the Glenlivet 12, with definitely more bitter notes. The thing though is that there isn't a lot of subtlety going on here. The flavors aren't so much blended as pureed. It reminds me a bit of Maker's Mark, though it certainly still tastes like a scotch."
3.5,A timeless budget bottle. Love the vanilla and hints of Carmel.
