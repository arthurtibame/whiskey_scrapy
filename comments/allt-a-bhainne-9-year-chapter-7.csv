4.5,"Impressions, shoulder level:

Pours from the bottle with intensely fruity aromas that settle to golden apples, white grapes, allspice, and fresh white bread.  

The palate is a starburst of fruit and wood spice, with mangos, peaches, white grape juice, freshly cut cedar, and pine.  At 60+% ABV, the presentation is remarkably balanced, and the heat and intensity build at a confident but deliberate pace (a small amount of water - a few drops max- and a few minutes of rest really brings out the best in this expression).  The finish is the star of this expression;  it’s outstandingly long and lingers on a very pleasant Manuka honey-like note, with a faint black tea note in the background.  

This is my first Chapter 7 expression, but  they’re quickly becoming my favorite independent bottler."
4.0,"A little harsh on the palate. Light and airy, not the richest taste. But very good, just not the easiest sipper without water."
5.0,"After adding a cube of ice, this was fantastic. Highly recommended."
