1.0,Feel cheated. Some of the worst whiskey I have tasted at the price point  Thin and hot. Lacks balance and complexity.

3.5,If it was priced at $20 it’d be a great whiskey but at $30 feels a bit watered down. I judged a book by its cover & missed.

2.5,Caramel and vanilla are there but it seems flat. From the scent to the taste. Surprised after what I paid for this. Decent but doesn't do enough to  buy more.

4.0,I like the limestone filtered water.  Makes the whiskey different from others.  I like it for the price too!!
