1.75,"Meh. I got it very early in my collecting days because it caught my eye. I didn’t care for it when I first opened it, so I put it aside for a couple of months before trying it again. Unfortunately, since then, I’ve become attracted to Booker’s, Elijah Craig BP and other high proofers.  It just doesn’t hold up at that price point. It’s sweet, but has a grassy aftertaste that lingers. There’s a lot of vanilla on the nose that doesn’t show up in the taste. I paid too much for it. Not offensive, but just barely “OK”."
3.0,"Leave it to an american distillery to take the idea of a ""sherry bomb"" and make it a nuclear one.  

Nose - Dusty wood and huge sherry notes.  You can't get any classic bourbon without really digging deep and looking for it.  There's some of that vanilla and oak...caramel isn't here.  

Taste - oak, red fruits, funk, must.  Really intense and it has a whole lot of flavors.  

This best reminds me of westland sherry with more of a bourbon note.  

This is a must get for those who are more experimental in their bourbon drinking or for scotch drinkers who want to branch out more.  The musty and funky oak notes might be off putting for some.  I'm loving them.  I'm debating going into the 3+ range but I don't get transitions or the level of additional complexity I'd want.  Instead it is more of a one trick pony which is keeping thing one from the higher scores."
