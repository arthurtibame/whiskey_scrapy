Palate: initial heat up front leads to a mixing of both nutty & spicy w/burnt sugar notes.

2.75,"This wasn't a bad taste but neither was it something I'd go back to intentionally.  Not challenging but there wasn't much depth of flavor or on the nose.  Just not a lot going on here.

Nose: Very subtle, sweet with vanilla and honey and...that's pretty much it.

Taste: High alcohol punch with some wood, vanilla, light sugars, and walnuts.

Finish: Short and spicy with wood notes.

Overall not my favorite.  I'm glad  I tried it so I can ""check the box"" but I wouldn't go to it again."
4.5,"Spicy. Carmel, butterscotch, vanilla clove, hits the entire pallet, front to back. Very intense with alcohol on first sip, but after pallet is conditioned, it doesn’t get much better than this one!"

3.75,"A quality high proof bourbon with a noticeable level of heat and oak. Not as sweet as many Bourbons and has a nice spice kick on the finish. Glad I bought the bottle, but overall I think Wild Turkey Rare Breed is a better pour and is 15 bucks cheaper in SW Michigan."

4.75,"Old Forester 1920 is up for review tonight.  The mashbill is 72% corn, 18% rye, 10% malted barley.  This one clocks in at 115 proof.  The color on this bourbon is reddish-brown color.  The legs are thin but run very slow. I don’t know the age but by the color you know there are some older barrels that make this one up.  The nose is ethanol, caramel, brown sugar, dark cherries, chocolate, and oak.  The palate is intense caramel and vanilla with the cherry’s and chocolate kind of like chocolate covered cherries, cinnamon spice, with a little alcohol burn but not in a sharp bad way.  The finish is very long and coats your mouth very well with all of the flavors lingering and making you want to take your next sip."

4.0,"Very interesting!  I don't tend to like higher rye mashbills, especially at a higher proof.   But I like this.  There's copious amounts of ethenol on the nose and palate, but it never overwhelmes.  Fruits and cinnamon on both the nose and palate as well.  The finish is perhaps the most unusual aspect to me - I consistently get a long and strong peanut butter note that fades in and out with some vanilla.  There are obviously plenty of other cask strength bourbons out there, but I have yet to try one quite like the 1920"

4.5,"Has the typical Old Forester banana, vanilla, baking spice nose as most Old Foresters do. Lots of corny sweet honey flavor... Made me think of a King's Hawaiian Roll... Immediate high proof burn, gives way to a moderately oily, smooth texture and a toffee & cinnamon finish."
4.5,"Nose: Sweet dark fruit and brown sugar, some leathery musk, a hint citrus in the effervescent tip of the nose. 

Taste: Cherry, leather, the body (not smoke) of a cigar, nutmeg, cinnamon,  with a long finish that leaves a heat in the front of your mouth.

Experience: it's a lounge in a glass. Cigars, cocktail cherries, and a dancer's kiss, all wrapped in alcohol and leather. 
This is a good one boys, it's a bourbon's bourbon (if that means anything.) 
It should hold up to rocks if you like and should be on the shelf next to EH Taylor, Booker's, and the such."

Finish is long and smooth, mouth coating with just a touch of Kentucky hug. I get some tongue coating over cooked banana bread in the aftertaste.

4.25,"When I choose a bourbon, I like bold flavors and complexity. What I have heard of the Old Forester 1920 Prohibition Style is that it brings both of these things to the table. Today is my birthday, so I decided to treat myself to a bottle. This is the first Old Forester label I have tried, and at 115 proof it is also the highest proof bourbon I have purchased. This taste was a neat pour in a Glencairn glass and I let it breathe for a few minutes before diving in.

I took my first sniff with my nose in the glass and my mouth closed, an amateur move that rewarded me with a punch of ethanol right in the schnoz. When smelling correctly, I was hit by the aroma of rich caramel, dark chocolate, toasted oak, cinnamon, cloves, and a trace of stone fruits. I think of both Christmas and luxury when I inhale these vapors. The palate has heat to be sure, but it is rich and smooth on the tongue. The taste is chocolate forward and is accompanied by cinnamon, vanilla, and notes of bright fruit. There is a smokey, peppery heat as the sip works its way back and down. The medium finish starts hot but quickly mellows into a warm, nutty spice and a lavish smokiness. By the third sip, I am adjusting to the heat and feel that I keep experiencing new flavors while at the same time being certain there is more underneath. Bold and complex is a great way to describe the 1920 and I am excited to see how a splash of water or some ice open this one up. If chocolate and heat are not what you are looking for, stay away from the 1920, but if you are looking for a bourbon that encapsulates the hedonistic and outrageous mood of the Roaring 20s, this is the one for you."

Eventually vanilla shows up with a dance of other flavors that last, and last.  You could pay far more and scour release lines and not find any better."

4.75,"At long last I grabbed a bottle of this heavyweight bourbon. I love OF Signature 100 so this stuff has a lot to measure up to. Poured neat, deep dark color sets the stage. Swirling it coats the glass like motor oil with thick globby legs. Nose is rich and pungent with melted brown sugar, nutmeg and cinnamon, cooked molasses, caramel apple, hardwood varnish and sweet wood. Complex and powerful. Luscious mouthfeel leads massive palate of creamy dark caramel, candy apple, rye spice, dark chocolate covered cherries and singed graham cracker crust all bolstered by sturdy oak. Great weight and depth. The flavors keep surging and morphing as you ride the wave of 115 proof to long lasting finish of baking and rye spice, raw cinnamon, fading dark toffee/caramel and rich sweet butter and oak . Slightly drying near end to balance out all the sweet notes. Warming sensation from the 115 heat is like a comforting hug. Absolutely fantastic! Easily drinkable neat or add some water to taste. I recently had KC single barrel and Stagg JR, two superb high proof contenders but will take this over both. Its more accessible, smoother and deeper. Bottom line this is one of the best bourbon Ive ever had. Its super rich with perfect sweetness and balance(OF100 on steroids)...........98/100.....cant recommend enough, buy this high octane candy!!!..........damn I love this mashbill!"

4.5,"Nose: Intense brown sugar, with all the classic bourbon notes (vanilla, caramel, wood)...but amped up. A nice undertone of leather as well. But the sweet stuff is what steals the show.

Taste: Sugary syrup up front. Spikes with cherry and then rides off with more sugar, char and some banana. Super rich and intense.

Finish: Sticks with you. That banana lingers (giggity), but some rye spice comes through as well. It’s like a peanut butter and banana sandwich.

Overall: This is one of my favorite bourbons regardless of price. Sweet, rich and complete enough to keep you guessing...while still just easy and enjoyable. I love the proof here, it feels perfect. And it’s a great transition bourbon if you’re looking to jump up from the 45% range."

Taste is caramel, heat and toasted oak with transition to subtle tobacco, almond and cherry finish that lasts  and dances in the tongue.

4.5,"I’ve been hitting the bourbon a bit more lately because 1) It’s finally fall in Texas (meaning the high is only 80) and 2) Seems like the price of Scotch keeps going up (new tariffs kicking in?...). I’ve always loved Old Forester. I’ve made short work of the classic, the 100, and a few of the single barrels. Been keeping my eye on this one for some time, but I kept my distance because spending more than $40 on bourbon seemed...unnecessary to me with all the quality offerings. 

For a high proof bourbon (it doesn’t say barrel proof, but it must be close) I don’t get that ethanol punch on the nose. Instead I get brown sugar, cherries, and vanilla dialled up to 11. The taste is that classic OF profile. Brown sugar, caramel, and a SUPER oily mouthfeel that results in a very long finish. My favorite part may be the big Kentucky hug at the end. This is definitely a slow sipper, and at $50, it’s a bargain (negating my earlier statement about paying for bourbon). Believe the hype. This one’s a keeper!"

3.75,"Day 2 of my bourbon advent calendar

Nose: Starts with sweety baking spices like cinnamon, or nutmeg, and a subtle banana note buried behind some oak. Not a whole lot of ethanol for something a little higher on proof

Plate: It starts quite hot and stays hot, but also has slight creamy texture, and the finish is decent.

This is a great affordable option for someone looking into higher proof bourbons. However, this is not my favorite Old Forster expression. I personally love all single barrels from them, but it's still a good go-to for when I'm craving something high proof because it's readily available for me."
3.25,"Good solid bourbon, but sits at a weird price point. A little too expensive to be a daily drinker but not exceptional enough to be a special bourbon. I guess it’s an every other day drinker!

Caramel, vanilla, and burnt sugar on the nose. Flavor profile is all sweet up front and a slight dry rye at the end. Not terribly complex but not in a bad way. At this price point I’d rather drink blantons which is what this is trying to be and only slightly cheaper.

4.0,"BACKGROUND: The 1920 expression was the third of four releases in the Old Forester Whiskey Row series of bourbons, which highlights various periods in the Brown-Forman company’s history.

The other Whiskey Row releases include the 1870, which symbolically evokes the original batching process of the first Old Forester bourbon, the 1897, which celebrates the passage of the Bottled In Bond Act, and the 1910, a heavily-oaked bourbon representing a bottling line fire that occurred at the distillery in the early 20th Century.

The 1920 is a “Prohibition Style” whiskey reminiscent of the bourbon being produced at the time the federal Volstead Act was enacted by Congress.  Brown-Forman, the maker of Old Forester, was one of six distilleries licensed to manufacture “medicinal whiskey” that could be purchased with a doctor’s prescription throughout Prohibition.

At 115 Proof, the 1920 has the highest alcohol content of all the offerings in the Whiskey Row series, and that particular proof point is significant in the telling this particular bourbon’s story.

During Prohibition, whiskey was required to be bottled at 100 proof, but to keep from adding too much water to the aged whiskey to proof it down, distillers also barreled whiskey around 100 proof. Brown-Forman estimates that, with “angel’s share” factored in, an aged bourbon of the era would have been about 115 proof out of the barrel.

NOSE: The nose smells strongly of banana, which is typically of many Brown-Forman products, but oak and an underlying scent of citrus are present, as well.

PALATE: The palate tastes completely and EXACTLY like the cordial juice inside a chocolate covered cherry.  The cordial flavor is so dominant that it supersedes anything else.  The oak and caramel, for example, that are typical in most bourbons are rendered completely mute in this one.  It is a sweet and exceptionally tasty palate. 

FINISH: Rye spice and chocolate finally make an appearance on the finish.  The heat from the 115 proof and the palate flavor combine to form a cherry flambe’ that subsides into a distinct after dinner mint flavor.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: I consider myself a student of history, and one of the reasons I jumped feet first into the bourbon hobby was the fascinating stories that abound within its past.  The Whiskey Row series allows me to not only study the history of Brown-Forman and various eras of bourbon production, but to directly experience and taste them, as well.  

While all of the expressions in the Whiskey Row series are enjoyable offerings, the 1920 is a standout that I highly recommend."

Nose is a cherry bomb like real cherries, with brown sugar, vanilla, apple, cinnamon, light oak, hint of dark chocolate and a touch of alcohol letting you know it's over 110. Taste is not 115 proof tastes like 96 proof maybe 100. The fruit, sweetness, vanilla, brown sugar all jump out on the taste, mid palate you get a little alcohol burn as you also get hit with the rye (mint that shows on the finish), barrel spice and cinnamon. Finish is medium/long with the brown sugar, cinnamon, some oak and the rye induced mint freshness (rinsing with mouthwash) feeling in your mouth lingering the longest."

4.0,"For 100th review, (whose counting), the bottle of ""prohibition"" style whiskey jumped out at me.   There are certain bottles you can open and get a feeling of stepping into the past, maybe something your great granddad would have sampled.  Bottles like Jim Beam Repeal Batch, or just Gold Label(BiB), Old Granddad hi-test, a few others and now Old Forester enters the fray with an advertised ""antique"" style whiskey.

No pun intended, this one is full of spirit.  A formidable body of aromas rise in the nose, perhaps a citrus punch, hints of marzipan and certainly musty barn wood.  Sweet corn spirits in caramel and cinnamon spice make this a promising venture. 

This one front loads on the palate with a powerful punch of heat and spice, probably thanks to the substantial proof, the flavors swim and dance before the shear alcohol content breaks it all down.   A leather graininess and some sort of bitters, cherry bark maybe. Not much of a finish as it evaporates right out of your throat but while it lasts you have a delicious sample of all those nose notes to behold.    

The alcohol flash and bitter finish keep the palate dry and ready for subsequent sips,  proving the adage ""old"" whiskey's are for sipping.  The 1920 has gotten its fair share of press and blather from the whiskey channels lately along with enough paper-gold medals and certainly some of that is warranted while some is just hype.  There is definitely something for a whiskey drinker to like here as this one may fall into the classification of a ""whiskey drinkers"" whiskey.  Either way Morris certainly is on to something with his Prohibition style offering.  Cheers!"

3.75,"Sweet oak nose, strong burn, mellow finish"
4.75,"After trying four Old Forester products in the last 6 months I've concluded Distiller Expert Reviewers have a grudge against this product line. It's quickly become one of my favorite American whiskey brands. Almost always available at my local ABCs, this is an excellent high proof bourbon buy. I purchased this before Christmas with my brother and split the bottle putting my half into a Jack Daniel's SiB 375 mL (also split a Pikesville Rye).

The nose is very sweet without too much oak or ethanol punch. It is primarily berries/cherries with chocolate notes, combined with brown sugar/caramel with oak notes if you inhale deeply. Notably absent, the strong banana note I've gotten with most Brown-Forman products. There is a hint but it has faded over the months I've had it open.

It goes down so smooth. I know it's been open for 3 months but it was excellent upon cracking the bottle. Initially the fruit notes are present but they disappear, with mostly syrup and oak on the taste and finish. The oak spice and/or ethanol are most present on the finish. It is long, lingering for 10-20 seconds. 

My brother, who's more into scotch and rye and not as adventurous with high proof bourbons said this was one of his favorite bourbons to date. I highly recommend the 1920 if you're into the denser, sweeter bourbons with low rye spice. It's easily one of my favorites."

Body: more vanilla and caramel than I was expecting and not as much bite as I was expecting from a 115.  

Finish: slight burn on the end with some complex flavor appearing. Some hints of cherry or other fruit. 

Not rough where it takes your breath away but maybe one to let open up with a touch of distilled water.

Will be custom aging a bottle of 1910 with a bottle of 1920 to balance out the sweet and spicy, looking to do that in a 1L barrel for 8 months.  Can't wait to taste that result."

Taste - Gingersnap cookies, marshmallows, dark chocolate, a small amount of spice burn.
Finish - Medium-to-long. Lingering brown sugar taste with a hint of oak spice.

It smells like maple syrup and pancakes. The taste is thick and chewy, and reminds me of Christmas cookies. It is 115 proof and it does not taste like it. It isn't entirely smooth but it is incredibly balanced with a wall of different flavors. Adding a dash of water helps bring out additional marshmallow sweetness.

This is a surprising whiskey. I read fantastic things about it and I was expecting it to be all hype, but I could not have been more wrong. It is a complex, delicious bourbon with just the right amount of kick.

I was surprised to see the Distiller expert score for this is only 85. The scores are subjective, but they have no credibility with me when Evan Williams Single Barrel bourbon is sitting at 96. If you enjoy bourbon then try this whiskey. You will not be disappointed."

There are definitely dark red fruits in the taste. The savory peanut butter note shows up in the mid-range for me...I'm probably made of 60% peanut butter if you subscribe to the ""you are what you eat philosophy."" With a little water, this peanut butter note turns into a mild banana-nut bread. The finish fades out into a bitterness that makes me want to drink more. It is very easy to drink more despite the high proof, making it a dangerous but sexy pour. New staple for the cabinet."

3.5,"Hot on the nose with some spices, dark fruits, tobacco, and dark chocolate. The palate was pretty disappointing for me. There are so many different flavors here, but I thought they clashed more than anything. For me this was pretty hot, even for a 115 proof, and none of the flavors really stood out against the heat. It mellowed out with a few drops of water, but even then I didn't think it was particularly good. It basically tasted like a spicier version of the 100-Proof OF, with more cherry & black pepper, and a little less banana & vanilla. 

It's definitely worth trying and I'm glad I gave it a shot, but I will not buy it again at $55-60 personally. For higher-proof options, I think Knob Creek's Single Barrel picks are a much better buy. The ones I've tasted have a similar flavor profile to the 1920, but were much more well-rounded, and $10-15 less expensive."
4.5,Strong but sweet at the end. Very good!

4.25,"I'm used to higher proofs like bookers and other barrel proofs that are better at hiding their proof on the nose which this one wasn't great at hiding but, still able to get some nice caramel and vanilla on the nose. The taste was caramel red apple and the finish was long with a caramelized charred barrel."

4.25,"OldFo 1920

*NOSE: Fruit Cocktail in Syrup, the kind with extra Cherries. Burnt Brown Sugar. Freshly opened pouch of Chewing Tobacco. Raw Almonds. Varnished Oak. A Light Floral note comes and goes. Tread lightly or get admonished with a big hit of Heat.
*NEAT: Cherry. Deep Vanilla. Oak. Black Pepper heat. Pretty Basic. Just a tick on the Astringent Side, but not so much it's an issue. Thick Clingy finish with a BIG Kentucky Hug blooming in the chest. Cinnamon, Cherry and Oak layer on the palate with each sip.
*SPLASH: Nose gets Gooey, Sticky Caramel. The Palate gains some much needed complexity with Chocolate, Coffee, Sweet Cream and Hazelnut notes. A little added Barrel Char. The finish becomes Super Sweet. Fittingly the empty glass smells just like a Milky Way wrapper.

*VERDICT: I finally decided to review something from the Whiskey Row Series. I have a bottle of 1910 that I just can't make up my mind about ,so I haven't put pen to paper on it yet. I really enjoyed this. Pretty basic when consumed Neat, but man do a few drops of water open this one up. I see lots of people who are making ""1915"" by mixing this with the 1910, and I can definitely see how that would be a worthwhile experiment. I wish that I liked the Old Forester profile better, but I applaud everyone involved in this series for experimenting with batching, barrel placement, entry proofs, etc. to create unique bottlings. This just edges out the Rye as my favorite OldFo so far."

4.25,"Smooth and strong drink. Palate is caramel, apple, cinnamon, full. Enjoyed neat - great alone or pairs well with many cigars due to being so well balanced."
3.25,"Newer to bourbon but sorry to say I didn’t enjoy this as much as I’d hoped. I got burnt caramel and vanilla, which was nice, but I didn’t enjoy the pepper and spice I got on the back end. Still like Buffalo Trace and Blanton’s single barrel more."

4.5,"Massively flavorful and bold.  Ton of spice & smoke, fading in a very dry caramel apple finish. 
The ethanol hit on this one is substantial, but ice can smooth it out and bring out the caramel and vinila more which can otherwise be overpowered."

4.25,"You really need to take your time with this one. If you judge this whiskey on just a couple of tastings you're giving this whiskey the short shift. If you give this whiskey a chance it really comes through as a really great sipper. The nose on this one is great, something I personally wouldn't mind wearing as a fragrance. As you smell the rich cherry and wood you want to explore it deeper, but as you try and take a bigger whiff, your nose gets burnt as  you're reminded of that high proof. As for the taste you're hit with a rich, complex mouth feel that leaves your mouth a sharp sweetness and a nice burn of alcohol that fades into a woody after taste. This one is in the $60 range out here in LA, its a little pricey but I'm not sorry I bought it. Its a nice one to have in your collection."
