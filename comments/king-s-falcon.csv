3.5,"Mild fruity nose with a hint of peat, very soft and creamy on the front, goes down smooth, not much lingering flavor.  Not bad at all for a NAS.

I thought it was a great deal for $28.99 while it was on sale.  At $34.99 regular price, may give some competition to other 12y/o single malts from Speyside, yet."
