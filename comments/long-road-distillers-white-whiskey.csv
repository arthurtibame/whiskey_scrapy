4.5,Delicious
3.0,Nose (Neat): Light alcohol with slight sweet ripe banana smell. Palate (Neat): Little to no burn going down. Light spice on the front corners of the tongue. Slight sweetness of corn and short to medium lingering flavor. Fairly smooth and even easier to drink on ice. Almost desert like when straight out of the freezer and neat. Very mild for a white whiskey.

3.0,"I taste rye and corn. Has a distinct sweetness to it. Not bad, but not great either. Could be that in just not a fan of white whiskey."
2.0,my first from new grand rapids distillery
5.0,Surprisingly sweet white whiskey.  Very tasty for the rye mash fans. If your open minded enough to enjoy the unaged whiskeys.
