3.75,"Hmm once you get a bit of water in to tame the beast it's not too shabby at all.  
Slightly orange plasticky nose the palate once watered is still slightly harsher as most CS mid range Arrans are..very rough and ready for the most part. Still not to bad a dram..it has flavour and character..wouldn't be clambering for a bottle though."
5.0,"We just started may 2019 and i think we have one of the whiskies that will be on my top 3 of the year. Such an incredible dram, it was terrific. And i learned my lesson: i had only a sample which i share with a friend; after we tasted it, i was so pissed for sharing it, since i found out there was only 5670 bottles ever made AND YOU CANT FIND THEM ANYMORE. SO I LOST 2 WHOLE SIPS ON THIS BEAUTY FOR BEEN A GOOD FRIEND. lol.

Bottled at 55%, this whisky has been matured for 8 years in sherry casks, and then it was finished in Sassicaia red wine casks from Tuscany. I have never heard of Sassicaia before, but now i will never forget about it.

On the nose: perfect. Coffee, Orange jam. Sherried. Orange candy. Grass. Mint. Heather. Pineapple And Red fruits appear after first sip. 

On the palate: When i first tasted it, it was this instant reaction of ""WOW"". Chocolate milk. Dulce de leche. Coffee and Almonds.
Waffer (actually it tastes just as a sweet snack that exists only in Ecuador called ""Tango""). Orange. Super thick body. And to end this description, it tastes just like a dessert that is called ""Mil hojas"" in spanish. Well i looked it up on google and it is called ""mille feuille"" which is a french word that is applied to english. Look it up for yourselves and you will say: ""oh, i have tasted that"". 

Aftertaste is heaven. Smoky beautiful finish with some spiciness.
I reallu dont care which spice is, but it is amazing.

Overall this is a 100 over 100 dram, impossible to get (actually you can buy samples in Master of Malt) and if you ever find a bottle, please invite me. Sláinte!"
