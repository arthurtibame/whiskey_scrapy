0.5,Not good. Oily. Syrupy. Way too sweet.
2.25,"Has a very spicy bite to it and virtually no floral or sweetness to it. Has a very oily feel to it that last quite awhile. Not really a sipping whiskey, but pairs well with citrus mixes."
3.0,Theo whiskey!

2.0,"It’s whiskey blended with neutral spirits. On the bright side, it tastes like young whiskey with minimal character and a little burn. It’s nothing remarkable but you can do better for $15 — moonshine, Rebel Yell or Evan Williams are better. Would I buy again? Probably not."

1.5,Sweet.
3.5,Nice evening glass. Sweet with a hint of maple. Quite enjoyable and even better since it was a gift from Ranger Durkan.

3.0,"Appearance: This blended whiskey is a light caramel color. It also has extremely watery legs.
    
Nose: There’s not a big bouquet in this whiskey at all. But from the notes I detected, I got buttered toast, gasoline fumes, caramel, sweet corn, brown sugar, and oak. 

Taste: The palate is pleasant but not complicated. There are notes of sour green apple, peach, honey and caramel; it’s almost desert-like.
    
Finish: The short finish leaves a dry ashy yet honeyed aftertaste. It sort of reminds me of the end of a cheap sweet cigar.
    
Thoughts: This American blend I will say is not bad at all; it’s not going to be the talk of the town or anything, but it’s not bad. If you’re wanting a background whiskey that isn’t expensive to have with friends, this will do. It may pair well, with the sweeter palate as well as the ashy aftertaste, with smoking a pipe or cigar on a nippy night. Thanks, Bird Dog! Cheers!"
