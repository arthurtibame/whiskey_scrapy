5.0,"This is the way Jack is meant to be. The nose is a bit anemic, but still pleasant. The palate is amazing. Rich, dense, sweet, like butterscotch, very spicy, and woody, but not very tannic. And considering it's filtered, it's surprisingly tame, even at full strength (though I definitely recommend a hearty dose of water). My favorite filtered, barrel strength whiskey. Again, this is what JD should be (but it still can't beat an unfiltered, uncut bourbon). Well worth the cost. In fact, I'm tempted to buy two or three more bottles to keep around."

5.0,"First 5-star product from Jack that I would drink again neat. Barrel is really coming out, but smooth and added heat from the higher proof makes this feel more genuine and less mainstream fad. Something in the water still seems to make people get rowdy, but I guess that's like McDonald's fries, we'll never learn the secret."

1.0,"Overpowering Banana Smoothie on palate and finish. I ended up preferring non-Barrel Proof Jack Daniel's Single Barrel and Gentleman Jack over this due to that. However, this used to be the only Jack Daniels I kinda liked, until I couldn't stand that single overpowering note any longer. Friends seem to like, however. Sweet and deceptively mild for barrel strength, thanks to the Tennessee charcoal filtering. Interesting to set on fire and see the roasted banana flavor come forward even stronger, but as something kinda unique. For those who love Jack Daniel's, they must try this as it's a whole other experience completely different from Jack Daniel's Single Barrel."

5.0,Can you say bananas?  This is Old No. 7 turned up to 12.  If you're a fan of banana bread or anything dessert you've got to try this sugary delight. It is spectacular for the price.  Word of warning is that you must have some experience drinking barrel proof whiskey or the patience to sip slowly because it kicks like a mule. I can't believe the fine folks at JD didn't think to release this gem sooner.

Just a hint of tobacco finishes it off. Absolutely wonderful (neat) paired with dark chocolate or roasted almonds. One of my favorites. Bought on a whim and very glad I did. I'm halfway through and plan on getting another bottle when this runs dry."

4.0,"Rick no. L-18, Barrel no. 16-6021, bottled on 9/19/16, 64.3% ABV. Described on the box as aromatic, that's right on. Floral nose, but more complex than just that. Lots of vanilla, and alcohol sting (not surprising given the proof). On the palate, wood, spice, leather, turpentine, flowers, burnt sugar. Heat, yes, but still smooth relative to the proof, a Jack Daniel's characteristic. Layered, for you snobs you should give this a try. 10/25/17
  With some limestone water ice cubes, this gets sweeter. Not cloying, but it does highlight the brown sugar, and some additional nutty notes. 10/28/17"

Nose: sweetness from vanilla and Caramel blend nicely with gentle notes of apple and pear. Soft baking spices are present as well. Very minimal ethanol despite the 131.9 Proof. 

Palate: sweet caramel and oak lead the way. The oakiness intensified in the middle, but so does the sweetness joined by subtle spice and fruitiness. A hot and dry finish full of rich flavor. Spiciness and hints of apple sweetness tingle the mouth afterwards. 

Phenomenal Barrel Proof whiskey!"

4.0,"I finally found a good deal for this exclusive bottle back on Black Friday here in Virginia.  Using the 20% discount I landed this one for just over $50 for a 750ml bottle.  The specifics on this bottle:  Barrel # 16-7891, Rick # R-10 and bottled on 12-7-16.  It’s a luscious dark amber with an orange-ish hue and makes a big, oily slick in the highball glass.

The nose is typical bourbon:  vanilla, caramel and peppery oak.  The palate is heavy on the charred oak with a nice, balanced vanilla sweetness that fades into a drier than expected finish.  It’s a long, caramel corn finish that goes on for quite a while.

It’s easily the best Jack Daniel’s I’ve had at this point.  It’s hard to justify the normal $65 price tag, but if you can find a deal on it I thinks it’s worth it.  Sure, there are better bourbons- for less money, but if you enjoy the JD profile but need a bit more of a kick- then this is it.  I dig it.  3.75 stars.  Cheers."

In a world where freakin good bourbon & whiskey costs well over hundreds of dollars, this comes in just at $60 and the same level of quality.  Tasted blind, I would’ve assumed it was something out of Buffalo Trace or Elijah Craig, cask strength private labels.    Never Jack.  I only got myself a 350ml one for $30, but I’m thinking of keeping this as a regular in the lineup ."

null,"In a world of $700 2nd market prices for Btac and $150 retail rye - I shake my head and think - there must be a simpler more available solution? I turn to barrel proof whisky search for similar uniqueness, complexity and all preferably for a fraction of the cost. 

Enter: Jack Daniels single barrel, barrel proof

Reality check: Most big name companies don’t make such a readily available release of their flagship product at barrel proof; so kudos to Brown Forman and I feel privileged to be given a chance to try JD in its purest form.

Nose: banana bread, pancake syrup, wet hay, freshly cut grass, rubbing alcohol. 

Palate: sugar babies, shredded wheat, oak, Mexican vanilla. 

Finish: DRY, DRY, DRY... did I mention it’s dry? Super thick mouth feel, coats your mouth, long lasting. 

This is an interesting addition to our collections considering most of y’alls gateway drug into the bourbon world was probably heavily influenced by Jack.... - this is the no bullshit version- and at $65 the price is extremely fair. I like it, it’s unique and stands on its own in its own category."

4.0,"Wow, that’s gorgeous.  Dark amber yet crystal clear and sediment free.  Once the glass is turned the oily coating left behind is an encouraging sign that there may be something interesting here.

Moving the glass to my nose for the first smell and WHOA That nose!  Its green wood with a bit of pine.  After a few returns to the glass I get a little Banana and a lot of fig and raisin  CAREFUL though, because there is a lot of high proof fumes coming along for the ride.  This nose is so interesting, complex, and a unique change from the strong vanilla and caramel I am used to getting from drinking so much bourbon.

On the first taste, POW that’s high proof but without the heat between the first punch and dry finish.  It’s a full, rich, and heavy mouthfeel and body that’s creamy and sharp before a long finish that makes me think of small batch maple syrup.  The taste is dark brown sugar and molasses like a pecan pie with barrel proof whiskey sauce (yea its that good).

Sometimes it’s a cloying sweet root beer candy but that long finish that leaves your palate dry and burning and sometimes it’s a salted caramel dusted with black pepper.  

The best part is that I tasted this blind with no idea what it was and couldn't place it to save my life.  When I finally scored it, I gave it a 92/100 and then about fell out of my chair when I saw it was a Jack Daniels.  Can't recommend this enough, what a surprise."
4.0,"While I usually prefer my Tennessee whisky from the other side of the holler, so to speak...this gives even my beloved Dickel Barrel Select a heck of a run for its money. The nose screams Tennessee -  buttered sweet corn, cherry cola, maple candy, some baking spice and black pepper. The palate is sweet, smooth, and lightly spicy with maple syrup, creamed corn, cola, and cinnamon candy. I may not love Jack Daniels Black, but this is definite proof that they know a thing or two about good corn squeezins down in Lynchburg. Thanks, @PBMichiganWolverine, for sharing!"

4.0,"Bottled at 132.7 proof. 

Nose: great sweetness of vanilla and caramel. Classic bourbon notes. Probably one of the strongest caramel scents I’ve gotten from a bourbon. 

Mouthfeel: thick, mouth-drying, oily. 

Palate: tastes just like it smells. I could hold this caramel-y, vanilla-y deliciousness in my mouth all day. 

Finish: so long and rich. As o keep swallowing the flavors just keep sticking around. 

Overall: this is the first Jack Daniels product I’ve ever bought. From what I’ve heard this is far and away better than their standard offerings. This is just such a classic, sweet bourbon that would be a great barrel proof intro for bourbon lovers trying to get into barrel proof bourbons. I would love to keep this bottle in my cabinet always"
4.0,"[Whiskey Live NY 2018] - Hell yes, now this is how you do barrel proof!  You COULD conceivably take this neat, though cutting it with some water is probably the least painful way to go on this.

4.0,"I had always been curious about this one and have not ever seen it available at a bar to get a pour. At $62.99 I could never bring myself to spend that much on a JD product. However, then I read @PBMichiganWolverine review and noticed he had purchased a half bottle! Sure enough my local Total Wine had a Barrel Select 1/2 bottle for $31. At that price I was willing to risk it! This particular Barrel clock's in at 133.4% proof (66.7% ABV). 
The first thing I notice as I pour it is just how dark it is! Just as dark as an ECBP or Stagg Jr. I am guessing this Barrel has close to a decade in oak. As I taste it I am genuinely shocked as how darn smooth it is! I barely detect any heat! I am shocked it 133.4 proof! The charcoal mellowing clearly removing the typical spice swells you get with a Barrel proof Bourbon! The taste profile is fairly sweet with lots of vanilla, honey, toffee on the pallette, with a long oak, tobacco and minty finish. Your tongue tingles with a menthol feel. Adding and ice cube really brings out the maple syrup notes and some butterscotch. I think I almost prefer it on a big rock.
Now with it being in the same price range as ECBP, Stagg Jr and 1920 is it on the same level? I would say it falls just short. While it's by far the smoothest of the lot, it lacks the depth of flavor and complexity of those three.
I will say this though, I would not hesitate in buying a full bottle of this and will keep it in rotation! The smoothness compensates for the lack of depth. This would be a great Barrell Proof Bourbon for someone to start with if they have yet to try one. Solid 3.75/5."

It’s definitely sweet heat, but the sweetness comes first, coating the mouth gently. It’s not sickeningly sweet like candy, but warm like pie. Then the barrel proof heat kicks in and reminds you what you’re drinking.

You do get a bit of caramel and some minor vanilla notes along with oak but they are overpowered by alcohol.

4.25,I like to enjoy this JD on the rocks. Hints of vanilla with a big alcohol burn. Thick mouthfeel ... this will put hair on your chest.
4.0,"This whiskey is not for the faint of heart but please do not just mix this with coke. This is a very interesting whiskey but not surprising or complex for my palate. It's very straight forward and honestly (To Me) it's a Kentucky straight bourbon in disguise lol.

Nose  4/5 - Much like Old No°7 you get banana right off the bat but this is more rix and emersive after that you get brown sugar, Vanilla, toffee, grain, slight blackberry? finished with pepper and molasses, but hey this is all if you can get passed the alcohol burn.

Palate 4/5 - This palate is easy to describe.
Take the old No.7 recipe and age it longer then pull it straight from the barrel to the bottle. Smoke, Wood, dried fruits, spice and caramel.

Price 3.5/5 - $66 is not very welcoming for something that couldn't have been aged for more that 8-10 years, cask strength or not. Still this is something worth experiencing."

4.75,"Cherries and oak. Rich full flavor. Love it

2/19/20: finally bought a bottle. Let’s see how it is. This one is 128.5 proof. 
Nose: Very rich and full of caramel and cherries. 
Palate: cherries and vanilla with a bit of bite. 
Finish: vanilla and spice linger forever. Still such a great pour."
4.25,"Rick number L-1, barrel 18-9890, bottled on 10/24/18, 67.95 % ABV! The colour is impressive, very dark with almost some sort of a red glow to it. I get glue!?! on the nose, might be the smell of my burning nosehairs though, highest ABV I've tried so far! There's also definitely some maple syrup hidden behind the alcohol. The palate is massive. Brown sugars, lots of it, and cherries, dark and almost overipe ones. The ABV numbes my tongue a bit. After adding some drops of water the maple syrup shows up on the palate and finish followed by some bitter dark chocolate. This is some intense whisky, love it! Cheers all"
4.5,Bright and strong with a good smokey bite
4.0,"It really is amazing how Jack manages to keep a single barrel barrel poof bottling as a part of its core range, can’t think of another distillery or brand to do so. This is from barrel number 18-8757 and is bottled at 67.20%

Nose: As you would expect the alcohol punches you in the nose at first. Once you get past that I found some brown sugar, but that signature banana note is most dominant.

Palate: Tip of the tongue produces that signature Jack Daniel’s banana pudding. A hint of vanilla is there and barrel bitterness shows up on the back of the tongue. Didn’t pick up an alcohol note here, which I found amazing considering the proof.

Finish: Maybe the driest finish I’ve ever experienced. Bitter oak is the dominant feature here but that banana note pops back up here and there.

It has all those Jack signatures but with more intensity and higher quality (missing that glue nose and rubbing alcohol palate associated with No. 7). It is much more expensive, but is certainly worth the premium for me. The best Jack product I’ve ever tasted.

Cheers!"

2.75,(Warning! Inconsistent barrels!) 1st bottle: Nose has a honey undertone and light citrus overtone. This is a masterpiece that belongs in the Bourbon barrel proof club. Caramel undertone that flows through the pallet. Burn and spice peaks at the finish. ... Had a different bottle... 2nd bottle: Nose was all brown sugar. Burn is overwhelming in the middle of the pallets. None of the sour mash qualities present in my prior bottle.

5.0,"Was able to get a 375ml for $26 so not bad.  Poured neat, dark color leads nose of toasted marshmallow, banana nut muffin and smoky charred oak. Minor whiff of ethanol but my bottle is 133.7 pf so less than expected. Oily mouthfeel leads out palate of rich deep sweet banana taffy with sturdy oak and char supported by a nutty, singed pie crust note that is to die for. This is succulent and delicious, a universe away from standard Jack. I tried a drop of water which added more butter, nuttiness and oak however even at proof neat is wonderful and my preference. Finish is long with drying sweet candied nuts,char and buttery oak. Amazing!!!! Drinks like a 100 proofer so lookout. Im in total agreement, this whiskey is fantastic. I prefer a sweeter taste and this brings it in spades yet is still balanced with oak/char. Bookers is still the best ""bourbon"" Ive had but this JDSBBP (Tennessee whiskey)stands shoulder to shoulder with it.......98/100.........I am a fan of #7 and know many are not but would be SHOCKED if anyone didn't rate this at least a 4/5..........world class stuff just buy it already! Update: Been going through this magnificent bottle and it has only gotten better so upping rating.....99/100........"
4.25,"My first bottle of JD BP: 133.9 proof, 11-15-18 bottle date. A massive beast of a Whisky in the same league as ECBP A119. Has the flavor to match the heat, but drinks easier than the last bottle of Knob Creek 120 that wounded my delicate tongue (but tasted fantastic!). First impression is that the ECBP would take this one in a seven game series, but I will give it more airtime and see if it’s up to the challenge. A couple of sips and life feels alright....liking the purchase."

3.75,"This bottle was dumped from barrel number 18-5509 on 8-15-18, and clocks in at a proof of 128.2. I NEVER drink Jack Daniel's and was initially hesitant to buy this one, hence the reason I bought the 375 ml offering. I am now wishing that I had bought multiple bottles of the 750 ml offering because this is an incredibly sweet and tasty sip!

The initial pallet explodes with a sweetness of flavors. You get a lot of graham-cracker on the tongue with just the right amount of pepper and spice. This one doesn't drink like most barrel proof bourbons that I have had the pleasure of tasting as the heat disappears fairly quickly, which is unfortunate. The finish is quite long, however, and more than makes up for this. A large amount of burnt wood, followed by woodspice and maple syrup linger on the back of your tongue long after you've finished. I highly recommend this one to anyone, even Jack Daniel's haters like myself."

3.5,"Signature JD banana nut scent along with oak, maraschino cherry, musty barrel funk, and a hint of clove.

Palate is like a mix between Bananas Foster and rocket fuel. Proof definitely comes through in a big way and overpowers everything. There’s some good stuff in the finish; sour cherry, cola, cinnamon, and charcoal but the flavors struggle to get through the heat. Heavy, syrupy mouth feel, coating the palate and throat and then finishes dry as the Sahara. Just when you think it’s settled it comes back with a big Kentucky hug.

I wanted to like this more than I did. Too unbalanced and too alcohol forward even for a barrel proof. Not worthy of a rebuy."
1.5,"Jesus Jones ..might as well take some jungle heat, some oak, and fear of being eaten by velociraptors, then mix it all into a stiff drink. I'd probably just let the raptors eat me, rather than chug a bottle of this to induce alcohol poisoning.

Heat, oak, spice, and heat. Just not enjoyable."

4.5,"A boozy nose bursts with notes of wood polish, demerara syrup, honey roasted peanuts, sweet oak, dark toffee, and banana. There's corn mash here, too, and hints of the sticky-sweet proof bomb lurking therein. Finally, there's a fleeting medical woodsy on the tail end of the nose that is not unlike an authentic root beer, anise, or horehound candy. It's a caramel bomb--and one for those who like not only dark sugars, but slightly burnt ones as well. Yet all the while, there are the assertive banana and clove notes.

The palate is oily, leading at first with beer nuts, old wooden furniture, black tea, fruity pepper, clove, and slight tannins which are subdued enough not to distract from the sweetness. The caramel is still here, and shifts immediately into the first and most prominent note of the finish: leather. It's like licking a new saddle-hide wallet. There's also peanut brittle, charred oak, and more bananas. Seriously, there are lots of bananas. The note with the final word is the medical earthy tea flavor accompanied by an effervescent warming sensation.

The finish lasts quite a while and is impeccably smooth and sweet for the proof. An excellent whiskey!"

Instant numbness around the edges of my tongue but none of the usual bite at that strength. A flood of flavor: rich and full. An equal amount of water reveals lots of ""comfort food"" tastes: vanilla, maybe cinnamon, some molasses or brown sugar hits in the majority. Bouquet has all of the above (except numbness!) plus some earthy, umami-ish tones, maybe leather? Finish is likewise smooth, exits gracefully but remains close by like good friends lounging in the foyer on their way out. I'd definitely buy this again to drink neat or with water or ice, and it would make a fine addition to a cocktail calling for whisky."

The nose has vanilla, a little rye, caramel, dusty peanuts, cola, green banana, 

The palate is syrupy textured with oak, caramel, vanilla sweetness, slight peanut can, and green banana. At this high of proof it’s not surprising that it dries the mouth a little. 

The finish is long with lingering peanuts, caramel and sweet vanilla. 

I was surprised how I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Considering the proof, I don’t get a crazy amount of alcohol burn or ethanol fumes. It definitely has a burn, but a welcome one for the proof."

4.5,"BACKGROUND: Jack Daniel’s pulls barrels from the upper levels of the rickhouse for their single barrel bottlings, with the barrel proof version being released in varying proofs ranging from 125 to 140.  The bottle I sampled was 131 proof, or 65.5% ABV.

I was prompted to purchase this bottle while reading the excellent book “Blood and Whiskey: The Life and Times of Jack Daniel,” which contains many interesting details about the Tennessee whiskey’s namesake.  Among those fact about Jack Daniel and his product were:

Though many of the Brown/Forman-produced statues and likenesses of him depict Jack Daniel as a tall, long-legged, skinny man, he stood only 5-foot 2-inches tall at his tallest and was demonstrably overweight in his later years.

Jack Daniel was taught to make whiskey at age 16 by a freed slave known as “Uncle Nearis,” not “Nearest.”  Apparently the marketers of the new whiskey changed his name because “Nearest” sounds more appealing and looks better on the shelf.

Jack Daniel started his first distillery at age 25 with a $1,000 inheritance from his father’s estate.  Upon receiving the inheritance, the previously destitute Daniel briefly left Lynchburg and later returned dressed in a formal knee-length frock coat, a fawn-colored vest lined with silk, a broad tie, and a broad-brimmed planter’s hat.  He would wear the same outfit every day for the rest of his life.

Jack Daniel drank his whiskey in a cocktail known as a “Tansy Julep,” which is made with whiskey, sugar or simple syrup, and tansy, a herbaceous flower that is toxic if ingested in sufficient quantity.

Jack Daniel’s whiskey became famous after he entered in an international competition at the St. Louis World’s Fair, also known as the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, in 1904.  The bottle he entered was awarded the Gold Medal for “World’s Finest Whiskey”

Tour guides at the Jack Daniel’s distillery claim that its founder once kicked a large safe out of frustration when the combination would not work, and the foot injury he sustained led to his death.  While it is true that Daniel did famously kick the safe in 1906, he did not die until1911, and his death at age 62 was related to diabetes.  Daniel’s leg was amputated at the thigh the year before his death as a result of his diabetes.

If asked, tour guides at the Jack Daniel distillery claim that no one knows exactly why the phrase “Old No. 7” appears on the bottle.  Perhaps the reason they claim ignorance is because the story is neither simple nor sexy.  During the time that Jack Daniel founded his distillery, alcohol taxes comprised roughly 70% of the federal government’s total revenues.  To facilitate collecting those taxes, the IRS divided Tennessee into five tax districts and also assigned a number to each individual distillery.  Originally, Jack Daniel’s distillery was Distillery No. 7 in tax district 4.  After he had already built a reputation for producing quality whiskey, Daniel’s county was moved to tax district 5, and he was reassigned as Distillery No. 16.  Distillers sold their product in barrels and pottery jugs with their distillery number stamped on the outside, so those numbers became the identifier that wholesalers used.  To let them know that the whiskey was the same that Daniel had always produced, he placed “Old No. 7” underneath “Distillery No. 16” on his jugs and barrels.

While Frank Sinatra’s public enjoyment of the product helped make Jack Daniel’s popular in the modern era, other celebrities made no secret of their love for it.  Among them were U.S. Vice President John Nance Garner, Nobel Prize-winning novelist William Faulkner, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, and President Harry Truman, who sent a case to Winston Churchill. 

NOSE: The nose smells strongly of banana and dusty corn though there is a bit of oak present, as well.  For a 131 proof whiskey, however, there is decidedly little ethanol presence on the nose.

PALATE: The delightfully thick and syrupy mouth feel of this whiskey is the first detail I noticed, and it was followed by a flood of flavors that included sweet corn, oak, toffee and banana.  The palate is all at once sweet and savory.  At this point, the strong alcohol presence made itself known with a noticeable tingle on my lips and tongue.

FINISH: This barrel proof whiskey has a significantly long finish, and the initial tingle on the lips and tongue spreads to the roof of the mouth.  The finish is a decidedly sweet one.  A pleasant warming in the throat and chest appear, but there is no real burn despite the high alcohol content.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: Retailing for less than $60, the Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Barrel Proof is one of the best buys I have ever discovered.  The combined sensation of sweetness and savory flavor is unique to this whiskey, and one of the most pleasant experiences I have had.  This bottle now ranks in my top five all-time favorite whiskies."
3.5,"Jack Barrel proof is the simply Lynchburg’s flagship product straight from the barrel without any dilution or blending. It is the normal recipe of 80% corn, 12% rye and 8% malt and dripped through 10 feet of sugar maple charcoal over sis days (the Lincoln County Process) to produce a dark caramel body.  This bottle was from Rick L-21, Barrel 15-5671, bottled on 8 October 2015.
The taste is a strong caramel followed by a bit of burnt toffee with vanilla. Jack has a sweet finish and doesn’t have the depth or complexity of over whiskeys, but remains smooth even with the barrel proof heat. It  has a bold spicy finish with hints of burnt oak.  Be prepared for more pronounced differences from bottle to bottle since this product goes straight from barrel to bottle, but if your goal is seriously calming after a rough day, this may be the best value Lynchburg has to offer."

N (4): Initially punched me in the face and I couldn't get anything. After tasting and I resniffed it, got some caramel sweetness with a hint of fresh banana. No need to add water to this one, I just put my nose too deep. 
P (4.5): Initially with some dark bitter chocolate in the front then got a hit of brown sugar in a oatmeal. On the second sip, it was a bit sweeter than bam....full on banana cream pie. Cream made with full fat cream. Had some nice spice around my tongue as well.
F (4.5): Spicy creamy banana with oak finally coming in. Heat was mild. Pretty long lasting.

3.75,Nose comes across as sweet with honey and caramel notes. First sip takes you back as it brings the full heat of a barrel proof offering. Tastes of vanilla fade away as a strong cinnamon burn takes center stage. Long burn to the sunset. Overall not nearly as special as the JD single barrel rye.
3.5,"Tasting:  1 oz. neat in mini glen cairn tester glass.  This was a 2019 Binny's store pick sample given to me by Dave John.

Nose: (3.75) Molasses and brown sugar dominate.  It is a sweet nose that does not give way to what is yet to come.

Palate: (3.5)  Spicy cinnamon and oak hit you hard.  Not to say that it is overpowering but it is a bit shocking at first.  Wasn't ready the first time and I admit the second sip I had to brace myself.  Their is a tremendous richness about the texture-- velvety and coating.  After the initial spice hits you, some more brown sugar and maple syrup flavors come through which are quite nice. Vanilla makes its debut at the back palate.  The addition of a drop of water opened up some ridiculously good chewy toffee.   I strongly recommend a drop of water or two.  It really seemed to be a key to some things that originally were drowned out by that spiciness.

Finish: (3.25) Long and lasting.  It is a bit drying and I taste a lot of oak followed by some cinnamon candies.  I can't quite get over the dryness as it sort of sucks the life right out of that rich coating feeling I liked on the palate.

Overall:  I truly enjoyed my 100 proof Binny's store pick from earlier in the year.  Being a fan of high proof, and especially barrel proof whiskey I had super high hopes that this would be even better.  I can't say that it was.  I was overwhelmed on the front by spice, and dried out on the finish.  There were some good things inbetween, and water helped, but not enough to win me over."

This barrel is 131.9 proof! It doesn't drink anywhere near its heat. It's full-bodied and explosive in flavor. Lots of sweet butterscotch! 

There's almost no pepper on the finish but you definitely can tell that this is a high-octane whiskey.  Lovely fade!

The JD banana note is just barely in the background.  Slight baking spice.  Little cinnamon.  This is surprisingly subtle.  Like a vanilla scone.  Light, delicate, but also delicious smelling.  Surprised to write light and delicate in this tasting....

Mouth feel is syrupy and oily.  Really viscous.  Oh man, oh my.  Yep that is a vanilla bomb, a delicious vanilla bomb.  The cinnamon and baking spice is escalating.  The banana note is coming in too.  Wow that is banana fosters, smoother in rich vanilla ice cream.

I am constantly amazed about what Jack Daniels can be when it’s not water down to nothing.  This barrel pick just raises what is possible even higher."

The palate immediately showcases the charcoal featured JD profile but also pushes the sweetness of traditional bourbons, banana & cherry are visible. It’s barrel proof moniker is true to its name as it tastes spicy, but the alcohol intensity is dulled by their signature mellowing. The edges are well rounded and make this barrel proof very wonderful and delicious.
The finish isn’t as long as expected, but well timed. It lasts long enough to showcase the falling of the sweetness replaced by the charred barrel, tobacco, and a little more banana."
3.5,"Drank neat 

Bottle I picked is a whopping 135.1 proof, so (without say) the initial  kick on it is STRONG. Take a few sips to get your mouth used to it then, try to really taste it. Overall, it's not bad.

Tried on the rocks

A lot more palatable, the cooler temp makes it a lot smoother going down!

Tried with some water

Really opens up the flavor. Like some of the other high proof bourbon in my collection, i think this one is best muddled down with some ice and just a hair of water to open it up"

5.0,"""The whiskey is amber in colour with notes of sweet vanilla, toasty oak, citrus, dried fruit, brown sugar and black pepper. I first tasted it in Glencairn glass where I experienced a strong burn immediately on the nose and then I tasted it in the Norlan glass with a few drops of water which opened it up. The glass itself removed the whiskey burn so for people who are experiencing the burn please try with a better glass for a better experience. It’s an awesome whiskey to be enjoyed in moderation."""

This is a whiskey I've been anxious to try for a long time, but was afraid to buy because of the price and my disappointment with the standard JD Single Barrel. I put my stimulus check to good use and purchased this in April when it was on sale for $65. At the moment this is my favorite American whiskey/bourbon I've had, tied with the Knob Creek 15Y store pick I bought last year. It is excellent, and blows all other Jack Daniel's products out of the water.

First off, the bottles Jack Daniel's uses for their single barrels are great. They may be the best bottles to keep as a decanter. I've been using a 375 mL bottle for over 6 months splitting purchases with my brother, and I will definitely keep this beautiful 750 mL bottle. The cork, the glass, the symmetry, all top notch. Highly recommend buying a single barrel bottle as a gift.

The nose is a rich, dense creme brulee with hints of dark fruit, fried banana, and cinnamon. I get some oak and ethanol, but it is light unless you inhale deeply. The burnt vanilla, maple sugar wood, and dark fruit dance on the tongue. It does not taste like a cask strength at all until the finish. Then boom, a long, tannic, spicy, and sugary finish that really lingers. Sometimes I feel like charcoal filtering really mellows out/removes the flavors in cheaper JD products and also Michter's, but with this whiskey I don't think that is the case whatsoever.  

If you're a fan of Old Forester 1920 you're going to love this. I've seen these anywhere between 128-136 proof in the last year. I thought I missed out by not picking up a higher proof version when I could. But nope, this barrel was fantastic. Considering I see at least 5 of these on the shelf at every ABC store, clearly it is overlooked when people are searching for cask strength bourbon. They shouldn't."

4.5,"Hardwood, vanilla, and banana bread on the nose. Oak, spice, caramel, and banana on the palate with a nice and very long oaky finish."
4.25,Creamy vanilla and strong ethanol on the nose. Lots of spice up front.  Char and sugar heavy on mid and a creamy caramel smooth finish. Adding a little water calms the spice but not the sweet smoothness. Very nice after water or ice with fantastic mouth coat. Gets better with each sip.
