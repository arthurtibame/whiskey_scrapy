5.0,I'm a novice when it comes to whiskey. I just tried this at the Heathrow airport.  What an amazing drink.  No water is needed at all. Very smooth with clean tastes.

4.0,"Smooth, spicy but doesnt have a bitter after taste. Very easy to drink. Too bad the smell is quite light."
4.0,"The Glenlivet released some time ago the ""Master Distiller's Reserve"" expressions for duty free. The 3 expressions have different prices, the ""Master Distiller's reserve"", the Solera Vatted and this small batch release. After having the three of them i got to say the best one for me is the Solera Vatted. This review is for the Small Batch one, which is actually the most expensive of the range. It is numbered  and its a fancy nice bottle that goes for around $125.

Bottled at 40%abv.

On the nose, it is very good. Prunes, Cereal, apple juice, Cola, blackberry jam, Pineapple, Orange jam, Hot honey, fresh warm Oranges. Great.

On the palate it is very drinkable but maybe too watery and a little ""normal"". It is just pepper, apples and honey.

Aftertaste gets a little better, with hay, honey and apple sider finish.

Overall this could be a lot better. The palate was too watery and straightforward. Don't get me wrong, nothing off putting or bad, just not what i expected. 80 over 100."

3.0,"Feels like Glenlivet wasn't in the mood to take risks with this one. There's nothing wrong with this expression, but there's also nothing right with it. It's... generic. 

Nose is sherry, and there's honey and oak on the palate. Body is decent, and so's the finish. 

It's ok."

5.0,"I like The Glenlivet at all and this one is very special. The price is very high for this kind of quality but the taste is awesome. Little bit spicy, with fruit tones and vanilla notes. Good with H.Upmann Magnum 54."
