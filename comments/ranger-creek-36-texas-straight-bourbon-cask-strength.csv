3.75,"Big spice and mellow sweetness. I’ve tasted some variation as my father has gifted me bottles over the years. I’d recommend. Website says “new wood” flavors, and I’d agree."
4.0,"Dark amber color
Smells of vanilla and brown sugar
Taste of  a bit of caramel and butter scotch and moves into cinnamon. Good body overall with a nice burn at the front. 
After taste sits in the mouth a bit with a slight sweetness and warm spice"

4.0,"Tasty, yet doesn’t really grab my attention.  Has a sweet taste with a bite, but not in a great way."
3.75,Oaky cinnamon and spice followed by salted oaky vanilla. Definitely a challenging pour
