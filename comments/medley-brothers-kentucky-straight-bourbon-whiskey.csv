1.75,"Ethanol in the nose is a bit off-putting. Corn crushes it on the palate, along with some raw cereal meal and mild spice. 
Finishes with character that reminds me of yeast. Almost similar to a beer wort."

2.5,"A bit rough when drank neat, added a large cube and it helped.  Probably best suited for a cocktail."
