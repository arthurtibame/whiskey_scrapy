1.75,"Dr. McGillicuddy’s tasting 3 of 3 for this evening. Masochism is a thing.

The nose: so peach. I’m biased. This smells awesome.

The body: I don’t hate it. The peach packs a punch. Not much else there.

The finish: nope.

IMHO this is the best Dr. McGullicudys. Not saying much, but if your a fan of peach stuff... actually no. Even then you should go buy crown royal peach instead. No market value for this little guy."
