3.0,"I'm on the fence on this one - I don't dislike it, but I can't say I like it either. The nose is clearly ice wine, but there's also a complex layer of apples and oak. So far so good. The palate is where it all starts to unravel, and barely manages to stay together with some caramel and spice (perhaps cinnamon). The finish is pleasant and smooth, and thankfully short enough so that you can proceed to a better whisky."

4.0,"A sweet, spicy and fuity Whisky. A rather long finish. A light golden color. 
On the first try there is a fresh ad spiky feeling. Woody on the finale. 
I was surprise. A good whisky."

2.0,"GLEN BRETON RARE: a sadder scotch offering. Unimpressed bottle and label, thin colour, thin taste.
Nose:  peat , campfire marshmallows, butter
Taste: thin and green, tangy and bitter. long lingering finish of dark chocolate and cigar tobacco."
