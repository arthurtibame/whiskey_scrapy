4.0,"Starts strong, a lot of burn. There is a strong flavor from the barrel. It got considerably more mellow with some time to breathe and some rocks. Overpriced but good."
4.25,"Really enjoyed this. Complex, leather and oak. Really good"

4.25,"I love bourbons have have a very prominent sweet corn nose almost as sweet as corn deer attractants they smell so good and this has it. Carmel corn and vanilla. Palate is classic bourbon all the way. Sweet corn,vanilla,  custard and brown sugar. Medium to long finish on first few sips. This bourbon is absolutely delightful. It hits every mark. I cant wait for this to open up a bit."
4.0,"Booze forward, with a little molasses, and apples on the nose...with a hint of sherry or almost a cherry.  Then the flavor explodes with a sherry and virgin oak bite, then immediately dissipates when it hits the back of your throat to just a smooth warming aftertaste with no bite or burn at all as it goes down.  Worth the buy!"

3.75,"Nose leads with leather, vanilla, fresh apples, some orange peel, and a tiny bit of nuttiness. Maybe a faint floral note in the background? Not much oak. A little bit of ethanol at first, which fades after a few minutes. 

Pleasantly coats the palate with notes of brown sugar, honey grahams, vanilla, apples, and a (pleasant) earthy note. A bit of bite on the back palate, but not much spice. The vanilla and brown sugar notes linger on the medium finish along with a hint of oak. 

A few drops of water didn't seem to change the nose, but noticeably amplified the sweeter notes on the palate (especially the mid-palate).

Overall it's quite good, but maybe not a standout worthy of Limited Edition status. I really enjoyed the complex nose, it seemed like I got something different every time I sniffed. The palate was more straight-forward but still pleasant. 

This actually reminds me of some of the better Russell's Reserver barrell picks I've had in the past, which is strange since most sourced KY Bourbon is assumed to come from Heaven Hill or Barton 1792."
