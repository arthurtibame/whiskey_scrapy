4.0,"Vanilla, then peat finish"
4.0,"Good bourbon with a buttery vanilla taste. 
It definitely needs a bit of breathing time. 
Don't add more than a tea spoon of water because it drowns easily. 
85/100."

1.0,Extremely burnt wood. No satisfying burn...more like 100+ proof rye. Very unenjoyable even on the rocks. Not well made. Waste of $34

3.5,"Didn’t love it, spicy and thin. Wouldn’t recommend."
3.5,"Better than expected and on par with, or better than, many other more highly rated selections."
3.25,"The nose is sweet with grilled fruit, marshmallow, cooked sugar, sweet corn and a hint of oak. The cooked sugar carries strongly into the palate while the oak features more strongly as well, while the grilled fruit rounds it out. The finish is medium and sweet, with cooked sugar and oak fading alongside faint hints of brown sugar and grilled fruit."

4.0,"Better the second time around after bottle had the chance to breathe.  Nose is caramel corn, and mashmallow.  Palate is sweet with a pleasant crackerjack flavor, some butter and pastry.  Finish is where it drops off a bit with an astringent burn.  You can cool it with water without hurting the flavor.  All and all this is a 3-3.5 on merit alone, a solid 4 if you consider the value.  I like it and would buy it again"
3.0,"This is what I call ""campfire bourbon"" which isn't a bad thing when put in the right frame of mind.  Appearance is yellow-gold, and a bit thin but not runny.  Nose is marshmallow and pastry with vanilla.  This carries consistently into the palate.  The finish is quick, with a burst of warming heat but then kind of gets astringent.  A tiny bit of water takes care of that without killing flavors.

All and all I would give it 3.5 stars.  It is a sit around the fire sipper on a fall night kind of whiskey.  Straightforward and old fashioned with no tricks.  Not bad for what I paid at 13.99/bottle."
