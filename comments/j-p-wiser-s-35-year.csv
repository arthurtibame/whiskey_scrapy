4.0,"Not as good as some of the best American ryes, but definitely makes a statement. Beautifully balanced, like a world class orchestra where the overall product shines brighter than the sum of its parts. Great introductory whiskey for someone looking to dip their toes into the rye world but also seeking high quality right away"

4.75,"High West Bourye on steroids
OMG so good!
How do the Canadians do what they do turning out such old whiskey and rye at such low prices
This is $125 bottle in Canada and UK and is a 35 Year Whiskey
Unbelievably good
Perfectly balanced
Not a flaw of any kind on the nose the palette or the finish
Oak vanilla Carmel enough Rye to please a rye fan
Wow going to have to have another pour"

4.0,Same nose as the 15 and 18.  Taste is similar to 18.  Something artificial in this one.
3.75,Canadian whisky on Canada Day.

5.0,"Really loved this whisky right from the first whiff of wood on the nose through the long, lingering finish. The oak not too strong, the soft vanilla and sweet caramel just stayed around to enjoy. Took me a long time to finish my glass because I was enjoying the flavours in my mouth, I would give it a 5.5 if that was an option."
5.0,"So nuanced and complex, did not disappoint considering the price. Does not allow you grasp the breadth of what's going on right away but instead requires time to parse out. Don't be scared to splurge if you can afford it; you'll be rewarded for you bravery!"

5.0,"Returning to the Northern Borders collection from 2017 for my second multi-decade-old sample of the night, and what a treat. It’s a perfect realization of the Bourye concept, much smoother and better integrated than the High West staple. Deliciously creamy upfront and peppery on the back-end, it wraps up with a very long finish that leaves an aftertaste like a satisfying bowl of vanilla ice-cream. I could drink this all night. For a whisky that’s spent 35+ years in oak, some of it fresh, the wood influence is remarkably well balanced. It’s by no means a complex dram, but for pure drinking pleasure you can’t ask for much more."

4.5,"nez: caramel brûlé, bois humide et vert à la fois, canelle, muscade, clou de girofle.Pointe de cacao et soupçon de vanille. Grenier humide et vielle page de livre. 
palais: attaque de bois, épices de seigle et caramel. En développement le foin humide apparaît ainsi que l'anetn et le thym séché. 
finale : ça colle en bouche et sur les côtés de la langue. longue et persistante sur les epices et le bois. Une belle rétro olfaction de bois vert 

c'est excellent !!"
