5.0,"Nose: Buffalo trace signature smell plus a deep brown sugar gingerbread misting. 
  
  Palate: cherry cola, charred marshmallows, rye spice, oak , rich baking spices. 
  
  Mouth feel: full, round, thick and delicious. 
  
  Finish: spicy and dry! but not too spicy.. you're able to hold the whiskey in your mouth to enjoy it for quite some time. The oak comes and goes but definitely lets you it's there. 
  
   This is definitely an older Sazerac, it has many of the same flavor notes of baby saz but stands up on its as a beautiful older rendition of this fantastic flavor. some of the other vintages such as 2016 were hallow, disjointed and nothing reminiscent of the Sazerac rye i'm used to.   It's Everything you want it to be — besides available.😢"
