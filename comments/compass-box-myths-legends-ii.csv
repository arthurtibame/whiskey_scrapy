3.75,"The second bottle in this series is also a single malt, and like the first one from a distillery I haven’t tried before. This Glen Elgin has a nose of freshly cut green apples and eucalyptus and tastes of Fruit Gums, black tea and a dry white wine. Different, interesting and tasty, but in a lesser class to the first bottle."
