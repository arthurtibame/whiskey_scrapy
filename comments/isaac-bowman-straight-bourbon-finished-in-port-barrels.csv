5.0,"Awesome if you appreciate the sweetness of port wine. As far as this style of finish - I think it blows away Angels Envy. Bowman Port Barrel Finished is so smooth & has much more complexity than Angels Envy.  Again for this style of bourbon, I think Bowman has it!"

3.0,"Being that AngelsEnvey is the only other ""wine cask"" finished type bourbon I've had, not drawing from much depth...and I'm just a novice. But, like everyone else, there are certain bourbons I like going back to. This is one of them. Is it worth 40 bucks? MEH, If it wasn't born in Kentucky(my State), at the most award winning Distillery, and if A.Smith Bowman Distillery hadn't done such a fantastic job pointing back to the Bowman Family history and it's ties to early America and Kentucky on their bottles well I probably wouldn't have paid up to try it.(So I'm a sucker for patriotic themes) But I'm glad I did. My only gripe with this Bourbon...it is just too easy to drink. But is that a bad thing? As a fan of Buffalo Trace products, one of my faves is EH Taylor...just the right amount of bite.  Issac Bowman is a bit flat on the front. But what it lacks there, it makes up for in flavor. For me there is great balance of the Bourbon and Port. And behind the port I'm tasting Mash Bill #2, and that's Elmer, Blanton's, Rock Hill, Ancient Ancient Age. Nice job A.Smith Bowman. I'd be curious as to what a higher proof would do for this Bourbon?"

3.0,"Very smooth whiskey, very approachable for a port-finished whiskey.  I drink only neat, I suspect water will make this quite a bit sweeter on the palate.  I find it smooth, some port sweetness, a touch of tea leaves and cinnamon on the rather short finish.  Not spicy enough for my palate, but probably my favorite port-finished whiskey to date."
4.0,"Picked-up a bottle of this from the distillery in Fredericksburg, VA the other day and poured a couple of knuckles of it over a bourbon ice ball.  You can smell the port and it is not overpowering at all.  At first sip I was really taken back by it's smooth profile.  This is a fine sipping  bourbon!  I have yet to try it neat.  At $39.99/750ml it is worth the investment.  They did a really good job with this as it finishes up really nice too.

I agree with Jalau, that I prefer this over Angel's Envy, another fine bourbon."

2.25,Had this at a whiskey festival in the past. Didn’t love it then but had a bunch of different things then so thought I would try it with a fresh palate when I Saw it on a friend’s shelf. Sadly I agree with my initial assessment. The nose offers some red fruits and a pretty easy going not too burn heavy sniff. Unfortunately the palate is lacking. It’s astringent (not in the good Islay way in the bad cleaning product way). It literally left a bad taste in my mouth. I’d try it again but I wouldn’t seek it out. There’s a lot more better whiskey out there. I’ve been drinking with a bunch of southerners lately. I enjoy bourbon but can’t wait to get back to my Islay bottles at home. What I wouldn’t give for a Laphroaig/Ardbeg/PC to blast the rest of this off my tastebuds. I miss PEAT

Body- it has a rich fruit mouthfeel. The pit fruit continues with a bit of vanilla and even dark chocolate.
Finish- The fruitiness gives way to a dark chocolate nuttiness that reminds
 me of a fruit and nut bar.

This may be my favorite port finished. Would definitely like to get a bottle."

4.75,"This is in the port-finish/other-finish division of my finished bourbon bracket. Quick recap of the sherry-finished blind taste tests so far:

Joseph Magnus vs Noble Oak:
Joseph Magnus won.

Wild Turkey Revival vs Rabbit Hole:
WT Revival won.

Joseph Magnus vs WT Revival:
WT Revival won.

This next round is the two that inspired this whole event: Isaac Bowman vs Angel’s Envy. After that is Amador Double Barrel vs Jefferson’s Grand Selection, followed by Jefferson’s old rum cask vs Beer Barrel Bourbon. Did I mention that this is for science?

So off the bat... I like both of these whiskies. This was the most effective blind taste test to date. I wasn’t 100% sure which was which until I flipped over the cup. I was correct, but it was close. I came in with a believed preference toward Isaac Bowman, and good ol Isaac persevered here.

The nose:
Watermelon and sangria. Next to Angel’s Envy, the deep red fruit scents are amplified.

The body:
Sangria, and for the first time (back to back with AE), I get orange. Like a delicious sweet orange flavor. Body also packs more heat when compared, but I don’t mind.

The finish:
Sangria flavor trails off, with a bit of almond. The almond is new to me, brought out by the AE.

It’s encouraging to me that Isaac won. By popularity, a bit of an underdog. By cost, it’s cheaper (first time doll hairs =/= value in this bracket). At the risk of sounding hypocritical, (because I just mentioned how Revival beat Magnus because I preferred a subtler sherry influence), when it comes to port, it turns out more influence is better for me. I feel like the underlying bourbon of AE may be higher quality than that of IB, based on tastes theoretically not affiliated with the port finish. But damn... that sangria flavor. The sweet orange. This little guy may be in the conversation for the most underrated bourbon of our time, IMO. Can’t wait to see what the next competitor brings out of it in the next round."

2.75,Basil Hayden dark rye started me on a port finished bourbons.   You immediately smell the fruit from the port.   You also smell the alcohol a bit more than I’d prefer.  Neat there is some burn that hurts the tasting.  Adding ice dilutes the alcohol smell but there is still a burn on the swallow. There is a nice smooth body to this whiskey.  I can get a small taste of caramel but a lot of spicy.  I do not taste the fruit you smell.   Overall a bit more burn and spicy than I’d prefer and not the best aftertaste.
3.25,"I’ve had a bottle for a few months now. When I first opened it, I didn’t think much of it. After the 3rd or 4th poor this dram really opened up and delightfully surprised me. 

Nose: oak, barrel sweetness, slight vanilla and cherry note. A red wine/caramel finish rounds off the nose. 

Taste: port wine influence  comes out the gate fast, dark fruits and oak barrel sugars dominate the beginning. Cherry and cinnamon dominate the mid pallet. The finish is mildly oaky with a tinge of vanilla and caramel. 

Hands down the best Virginia dram I have had to date."
4.0,"APPEARANCE: Amber tending toward a reddish hue. A quick swirl formed slow moving thin legs. 
NOSE: Opening the bottle almost smelled like popping the cork on a bottle of red wine. Nosed in my Glencairn I found notes of Oak, Dark Fruits like Raisin and Prunes, Green Apple, and Red Wine with a Savory Slightly Sour note.
NEAT: Oak Heavy and Sweet. Red Wine, Vanilla, Cherry Coke, Raisins and Slightly Bitter Tanins. Only slightly warm on the finish with Sweet Oak and light Black Pepper Spice fading to Sweetish Red Wine. 
SPLASH: Gives the palate an almost applesauce note. Made the oak a little more sour on the finish. I definitely like this one better neat.
VERDICT: I liked my second pour of this much better than the first. I think some air really opens it up. This was my first wine barrel finished bourbon. Reasonably priced, and different enough to make this a repeat buy. 4 STARS."
3.75,"Traditional Bourbon with a bit of port - Isn't the most integrated finished bourbon I have had (Magnus), but definitely enjoyable"
4.75,"Okay this is another one of those underrated bourbons. I feel like when folk rate whiskeys they don’t take into account the price point. Yes it’s great to have a $220 bottle of Angel’s Envy cask strength, but a lot of people don’t live in that world. We should expect a $220 bottle to be BAMF. But to me, that discovery pales in comparison to when a $45 bottle delivers a dynamic flavor like the big boys. Enter my new friend, Isaac.

I get sangria on the nose. Like an authentic, home-made one. Tropical fruits, delicious. Body is gentle with vanilla and a deep cherry flavor. Finish is dry, with more of the sangria flavor trailing off. There’s a bit of watermelon in there too. This is delicious.

If you’re a fan of Angel’s Envy, run (don’t walk) to your nearest liquor store and buy this. Right now. Compared to Angel’s Envy, it’s cheaper, more readily available, and for my tastes, it’s better. That’s right. I said it."

4.0,"First smell my nose is overwhelmed by the scent of strawberries. Will I even be drinking whiskey?

The taste of strawberries hits my tongue, but it’s not as sweet as I would have imagined. There isn’t a kick. It’s gentle. The taste doesn’t seem to want to linger for long.

As I drink more the taste of the strawberries are more pronounced and the taste is sweeter. This is a very pleasant bourbon. Still not as good as angels, but not bad considering the price comparison."

Nose - very heavy cherries and a good sweet candy sugary smell.

Overall and value
I love a great unique taste and this bourbon offers not only a unique taste but also a great price point and cool looking bottle and history. Unfortunately this bottle is not easy to find in my area and had to order online. Paid a whopping 30$ but shipping can add a good 20$ to that bill. Overall this is a solid choice for a bourbon lover wanting something a little bit different fruity and floral without breaking the bank"
