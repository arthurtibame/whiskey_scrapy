5.0,"An amazing sangria wine with a peated bonfire whisky. Love it!!! My favorite peated whisky nose till now near ardbeg uigeandail. In nose i find  Olorosso notes, peat, bonfires, red fruits, home chocolate,a mix of jam fruits. A watery feel in taste with some red orange notes, blackberry jam,earthy peated notes, sangria spanish wine! The finish is long and smooth with bonefire flavour, cooked fruit like marmalade and shy wine tanins. Bowmore.. you created a masterpiece!"
