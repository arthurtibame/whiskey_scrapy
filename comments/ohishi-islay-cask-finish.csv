2.0,"Not too impressed. Nose isn’t as Smokey as I thought even though it’s very Smokey. Vanilla custards and baked fruits. Not bad, not great."

3.75,"Color is light straw. Nose starts with peat, followed quickly by a sweet backbone. Notes of fresh fruit and honey are present in the background. First sip is markedly peated, with a nice smooth mouthfeel. Notes of sweetness come and go, with several distinct, but hard to identify variations on the sweetness as the peat circulates. Finish is a further intermingling of the sweat/peat combo. Despite not being able to identify specific components as well as with other Whiskies, I found this rather enjoyable."

3.75,"not knowing the specific distillery for the Islay cask is a bit of a turn off. however, this is a dream for smoke and peat lovers while broadening horizons for those not quite ready for the full blown Scotch experience. almost “meaty” borderline sherry on the lingering taste. with a touch of water more of the orange and fruitiness come forward."
4.25,The Islay Cask is definitely making itself heard here.  This starts out mild and sweet for a moment before descending into quite a lot of smoky peaty goodness.  It has a nice drawn out finish that lingers in the best way.
null,"Oh my you can tell the Islay influence. Like sucking alcohol through a charcoal brick, or rinsing your mouth with grain alcohol after licking the inside of a smoker. If you like smoky and peaty this is for you."
3.25,More Islay than anything else. Tons of black pepper.

3.0,"Nose - light smoke with fruity undertones of pear and apple
Palate - light peat and earthy/soil notes turning to cut grass
Finish - more peat as the battle for smoke and sweet goes on throughout the finish"
4.0,Peaty and smooth
2.75,The cask takes the center stage here. Not a lot of smoke on the nose but quite a bit on the palate. Very meaty.
2.5,Tastes like I'm licking the road.
4.25,(Charlie) scotch notes.  (Jackie) Earthy but not offensive.
