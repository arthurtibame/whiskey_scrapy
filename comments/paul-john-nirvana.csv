3.25,I am not a Scotch fan.  This is light and has a hint of that Scotch flavor from the malt but without that peat that I don’t like.   Light and a good value.
2.5,"Aroma is basic but interesting, it shows a bit of youth and raw malt character but not in a cloying new make way (though their new make is pretty good); Palate is less sweet and less farmy than aroma but it’s no less interesting; Finish is warm but short and I really wish it would stay around longer. All-in-all it’s a nicely-executed basic whisky, which is exactly what it’s meant to be."
3.0,"Pretty tasty for a minimum proof whisky, with distinct milk chocolate and malt flavors. I hope this makes its way to bars (remember them?) as it would be a good value pour."
