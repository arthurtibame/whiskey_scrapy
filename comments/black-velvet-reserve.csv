3.0,"Clear, golden appearance, with a few alcohol legs. Nose- some standard, stereotypical grain whisky, with vanilla, oak, and nougat. Taste- similar, with, perhaps, some rye pepper spice. Mouthfeel is high to medium, and it lingers, a bit. To me, this is somewhat rough. RJT"

2.0,"Pleasant nose, light, smooth palate. Medium to long finish but here's a note in there I don't like."
2.0,Intense sweet nose. Sweet flavor with notes of spice. Intense sweet finish with a touch of oak & spice.

3.0,A great step up from standard Black Velvet. Much smoother and has a more clean taste by comparison. The closest you can get to Crown Royal without spending $40+.

2.75,"Nose: Rye spice, caramel, plums, ginger
Palate: Brown sugar, molasses, pears, apples
Finish: Ginger and some baking spices 

A very unremarkable whisky. Very smooth and easy to sip, it feels watered down. It's not bad, but it's very faint in both smell and taste and fades quickly afterwards. Good for beginners or as a mixer. Goes well with coke."

3.0,Positively surprised by the spicy flavors.
2.75,"Neat, real hot, a bit turpentine, but as it breathes it mellows a little. One ice cube makes it far more tolerable, mostly vanilla and spice."
3.75,Strong oak. Sweet but not very smooth.

2.0,"Smells lightly of a vanilla caramel, with some alcohol burn. Taste is odd, camel vanilla and oak battle it out in a fashion I found largely unappealing. I bought this to satisfy a friend, and while the goodwill gesture didn't cost me much-needed I still found it wanting."
