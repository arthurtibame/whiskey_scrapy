3.75,"A rich mouth feel and the flavors of praline, pecan, plenty of oak, white pepper, vanilla fudge, with a finish that is medium length, lightly dry, and a hint of oak. Since this is made in a double cask method - makes sense!"

4.25,"God bless Texas! I have become quite the fan of the Garrison Brothers line of bourbons, particularly their Cowboy Bourbon. That's why I immediately grabbed this off the shelf when I saw it—I truly felt like I hit the lotto in that moment. Most will have a tough time justifying spending $140 for a bourbon that is only 4-5 years old, but that is only because they haven't tried them some Cowboy Bourbon or Balmorhea. 

Like their Cowboy Bourbon, Balmorhea is incredibly dark in color. It's not quite the deep dark purple that you see in the Cowboy Bourbon, but it still looks great in your glass with its super dark crimson red appearance.

N: Not much burn here. Lots of oak, caramel and brown sugar. 

P: VERY oily/chewy palate, which I love! This thing is very creamy and full bodied. Like their Cowboy Bourbon, the pallet is oily, almost like a maple syrup. Flavors include caramel, pecan, and hints of oak.

F: Medium finish with no burn, which I was expecting/hoping for given its proof. The finish is sweet like a cotton candy with hints of oak and pepper.

I don't know if I fully buy into Garrison Brothers claim that 4 years in the Texas heat equates to 23 years in Kentucky, but I will say that this juice tastes a lot more mature than what one would expect from a 4-year-old bourbon. While I love their Cowboy Bourbon (clocking in at 134-139 proof), Balmorhea's lower proof is a nice change of pace and a fun one to sip on a warm summer day. This does not drink like a 115 proof bourbon (I can't decide if that's good or bad yet) as there is absolutely no alcohol burn present. What you've got is a very smooth, flavorful experience from start to finish. I highly recommend. Don't let the price tag cause you to miss out on a great bourbon from an awesome craft distillery. #TexasForever"

4.25,The 2019 tastes great!
2.5,Like breathing in through an oxygen mask waiting for an anesthetic on the nose.  Better taste with a nice burn throughout.

4.25,"The price point is high, but this is not your Tuesday night bourbon. Oak and tobacco, burnt sugar, some dark fruit in the middle. The finish is moderate and I was disappointed it wasn’t longer; but there’s a taste of Texas heat I really liked."
4.5,Tastes like a lower proof George T Stagg

Caramel and sticky buns are truly evident. A perfect bourbon but it is seriously pricey."

3.5,"My 3rd pour from the AZ Whiskey Community collaboration session and this is another Bourbon I have been wanting to sample. It comes with a really hefty price at $154.99, so let's see if it's worth that kind of coin! 

It's rich and oily on the palette with fantastic mouthfeel. Predominant notes are rich vanilla, buttered kettle corn and milk chocolate. There is a bit of sweet corn meal there as well. Mid palette adds a good dose of oak but it's  in balance with a long finish that adds clove and gingerbread to the oak. 

Now all in all it's definitely a very good Bourbon. It reminds me a whole lot of a single barrel I had from last year. Almost the identical profile but the proof bump here does make it more intense. That single barrel was $100 and this is simply not worth the almost $60 premium on that. To be honest the single barrel wasn't worth a $100 to me. 

This all ofcourse is very subjective. If you like Garrison Brothers and $155 is not a big output for you then sure buy this. If you are just looking for a special bottle, for me I would spend you money elsewhere. Cheers all!"
4.5,"Rich and delicious...  not for bourbon newbies... 
Can’t  compare it to any other bourbon...  It’s uniqueness is meant to be shared... its a group try thing... more fun that way... 

I recommend a 375ml bottle for up to 6 people for a fun group tasting. 

I don’t want a bottle for myself... it’s just too big and bold and hot... but a very good experience to have shared  with my friends."
4.25,Bourbon at it’s best! Caramel and vanilla nose with a little heat. Clings to the glass with great legs. Candied pecan and maple gives way to a medium finish. Best enjoyed neat.

4.5,"Like the saying goes, everything’s bigger (and bolder) in Texas! The nose is just a little bit young but after sitting for a few minutes, brings oak and vanilla with some stone fruit mixed in. The palate is bold with lots of salty caramel, toffee and vanilla. The finish is very long (surprising given its age) and intense with baking spices and a hint of mint"

5.0,"Garrison Brothers Distillery was founded by Dan Garrison in 2006 and was issued their federal permit in 2007, but technically he has worked on getting it started since 2001. He credits Bill Samuels Jr, Maker Mark's Master Distiller, as being his mentor. His prior employment was as a marketing executive for a tech company until he was laid off in 2008. Originally called Lone Star Distillery, the company had to change the name because Busch Brewing insisted it was too similar to their Lone Star Beer brand.
Located in Hye, Texas, Garrison Brothers benefits from big temperature swings in helping them age their whiskey.
Some good friends visiting from Texas gifted us this bottle as I have personally held off picking it up due to the $130 price for a full sized bottle. According to their conversation with Dan Garrison, out of all the whiskey the distillery produces, this is the one he's most proud of, and after tasting it he has every right to be. While the initial batch was aged slightly differently, Balmorhea is now aged 4 years and then transferred to another new charred barrel for another one year. It is named after a park in the area with a spring-fed lake.
Jim Murray named this ""The American Micro Whiskey of the Year"" in 2018 with some rather poetic description.
Mine is is rather more simple. On the nose caramel, burnt brown sugar, oatmeal, vanilla, and a bit of ethanol. On the palate chocolate fudge and molasses that give way to heavy charred oak flavors with leather only to be replaced with honey and fresh cut wood notes. Finishes extremely long with more heavy oak, burnt brown sugar, and buttered toast and cinnamon spice.
If the color indicates what to expect in flavor, this is probably the darkest whiskey I've ever seen and the flavors reflect that. Saving up money for a full bottle!"

4.5,Carmel spicy charcoal notes. Mahogany in color. Very smooth neat for 115. Aged twice which lends to the char. Love this Certified Texas whiskey.

4.75,"Nose: Fruits, cigars, new leather, wet roads, sour green apple, fresh mint, and creosote.


Taste:  Tart fruit, oak, cocoa, ending with a empty cigar humidifier.

Experience:  
Feels like walking into your ex coyboy granddad's study. He still wears boots, leather vest, and bolo tie. He chews more than smokes the occasional cigar and while he doesn't ride anymore he taught you how to crack a whip while your mom wasn't looking. 
Notes: Big, bold, hot Texas. This is a Texas bourbon through and through. It's darker than anything I've seen, the flavors are bold and and impossible to ignore, and it is thick and hot."

4.75,"Very Bold and Very Rich. This is an amazing symphony of wonderful whisky flavors.  Chocolate, caramel with a strong barrel char flavor and the right amount of sweetness to pull it all together.  Not for the beginner.  But it is an amazing pour.  beginner"
