4.0,It's a unique whiskey. Has a bit of a bite to it with a subtle sweetness reminiscent of a dry cider.

3.0,"Nice oiliness, and smooth, but flavors are pretty mute. Smells of caramel and finished sweet, but not with the fruit tones of Redbreast."

3.5,"On the nose this is deceptively ""single pot still Irish"" evoking the harmonies of apples, shortbread, and honey. But if one takes a moment to admire the nose one can experience a veritable bouquet of sensations that make this a whiskey worth experiencing. Its not out of this world... it is truly, properly, justly Irish. 

On the tongue is where it highlights and muddles. This is a truly Irish whiskey so the mouth will inevitably let down what the nose has built up. However, this whiskey does taste very good indeed. Even though its not what my nose led me to believe I'm still very much enjoying of the moment it hits my tongue. I'm neither bored nor disappointed, just simply cognizant. I'm put in the moment and my other thoughts and worries leave me when this whiskey swirls around my mouth. 

In closing, this is not a perfect whiskey. However, this is also not a whiskey that is difficult to enjoy. While the experience may not crest every peak it does a good job of reminding us what single pot still Irish whiskey is. I won't be itching to buy this again should the opportunity arise, but I certainly will be giving a thumbs up if a friend decides to pour us some. Irish whiskey tends to be narrow due to its nature and history and this Irish whiskey follows suit... but does it dram well.

Not 80 abv. Re-released at 86 proof. Much better than 
signature."

4.75,"I want to give this 5 rating, but I just cannot call it perfect. But for the value, this tastes so much more complex than its $$ price tag leads one to anticipate.  

The nose is floral and fruity.

Taste is rich, but vanishes fairly fast.  Honeysuckle, cherry, woods, green apple."

3.5,Fantastic Irish whiskey. Pot still spice present. Hints of caramel and honey. Long spice finish.
3.75,"decent pot still whiskey,  pretty smooth and a little sweetness"
3.5,Nice dram for the price point. Not as good as the powers Johns lane but good. I had the updated 43% version.

4.0,"I tried this one on a tour in Irish Whiskey Musem in Dublin. Of course the context mattered, but this classic Irish whiskey really impressed me. Rich and smooth, but on the hand very fruity, flowery and aromatic. I will definitely look for other Powers whiskeys."

2.0,"The nose is the best part, but disappears quickly.  Super short finish and barely anything left on the palate.  Leaves much to be desired.  Really surprising as I love John’s Lane 12 and the standard Gold Label! Oh well. Guess they can’t ALL be great..."
3.75,No grain. Only malted and unmalted barley. Unmalted was added due to English taxes on the malted process. This is very enjoyable. Spicier and vanilla. Sherry finish. This is dessert.
4.25,"A little kick, smooth, and some fruitiness"

3.75,"I might as well say it from the outset - I'm kind of a Powers fanboy, and a lover of single pot still whiskey in general, so there was no way I wasn't going to enjoy this lovely single pot still offering. The Powers style - rich, oily, round, almost chewy, flavor-forward - is one that I enjoy immensely when I'm in the mood for Irish whiskey. It captures, for me, the quintessential nature of traditional approaches to Irish whiskey making, and I'm here for that.

Now, this particular bottling is made up of single pot still whiskey aged mostly in American oak (ex-bourbon, I assume) barrels, with a small, but noticeable, amount of sherry cask aged whiskey present. This leads to a fairly predictable, but tasty, nose and palate with plenty of sweet vanilla, coconut fudge (really blows down those blues...), and spicy cinnamon-clove-nutmeg notes, with just a hint of nuttiness and dried fruits. The mouthfeel is oily and coating, but not as long lived as I might like on the finish, and (not shocking for an NAS), there's a little bit of heat at the very end. At $45, it's not a great value per se, but it's fairly priced. I'm not sure I see this as a step up from Powers Signature, though, which in the same price range feels like a better bargain.

Is this going to change your life? Probably not, but it's kind of like a puppy. Who doesn't like puppies? You might not want to take one home, but even the hardest of hearts can't help but be warmed by a cute little puppy running around. This is a puppy. You may not need a bottle (or maybe you do, if this is your thing), but you're a coldhearted bugger indeed if you don't at least enjoy its fun, easygoing character, even if it's not going to replace your Redbreast 15 or Powers Johns Lane or Yellow Spot."
3.75,"Nose - Crisp and refreshing with scents of fruit including banana, grapefruit and a hint of apple, along with subtle baking spices. 

Palate - The taste starts out creamy balanced with baking spices and cinnamon, apple, grapefruit and pencil shavings. 

Finish - The finish is long with granola, nuts and grapefruit balanced with subtle apple sweetness."
