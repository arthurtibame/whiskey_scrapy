4.0,Man oh man...I found some of this to try at a bar and I'm so glad I had the chance. Now I have to go on the hunt. Fearful because I cannot recall seeing this in the millions of liquor stores that I have walked in to. This is the red fruit and cream of bourbons mixed with the perfect amount of spice. It's like drinking a high end desert. Have to find it...have to buy it...

3.0,"The nose is fairly muted...mostly vanilla and wood, with a hint of anise and clove.  Palate starts just slightly sweet and smooth before immediately giving you a blast of cinnamon red-hots and lumber.  Not a hint of wood.  Lumber.  If you grew up heating your house with firewood, it's almost the same as the taste you get from inhaling hours of chainsaw dust as you rip through the semi-seasoned pile of lumber in the heat of summer hoping to get through it before the first snow flies.  For anyone else, go to the home store and smell a stack of rough-cut  4""x4"" posts.  Maybe lick one to get the full affect.  If you stick around for a few minutes and let the glass breath you might detect a bit of mincemeat and dark cherries hidden beneath the cinnamon, but the finish is all spice and wood.  I had high hopes for this, but at $35/bottle, I'd stick with E.W. Single Barrel or Elijah Craig Small Batch."

4.0,"Nose - Vanilla/cinnamon caramels, light sort of stale peanut brittle, salted peanut shells.
Taste - Spicy cinnamon/vanilla caramel, light black pepper kick, hint of salted peanuts, lightly drying oak, tiny hint of Luxardo cherry sweetness at the end.
Finish - Lingering but muted cinnamon spice, sweet Spanish peanut sweetness that fades fairly quicky that only leaves this dry oaky, light heat.
Score - 81/100
Final Thoughts - If I tasted this blind, I probably would've pegged it as a Beam product due to the peanut ""Beam funk."" It's a very easy sipping bourbon for the proof for sure, which I guess is a result of the charcoal filtering. The balance of caramel and peanut funk is a bit weird to me in that it works up until the finish where the peanut funk turns to be a bit too much like stale peanuts. This might be something I turn into something like a peanut butter cup old fashioned by using some chocolate bitters in place of Angostura."
4.0,"Peanut brittle and vanilla on the nose. A bit sharp on the front end, with a very light mouthfeel. Almost seems like cotton candy with a barely there feel. It's not cloying like cotton candy, but it's sweet. Hints of nuts, caramel, and some wood spice. The spiciness lingers, along with some bitter chocolate, bitter walnuts. This is a great pour, and a steal at $30. 3/29/17
The 15-year (!!!). What. A. Nose. Deep caramel, cinnamon, graham cracker. Fantastic nose. Smooth for the proof. A strange herbal element on the palate. Finishes with leather. Palate doesn't follow the nose, unfortunately, but this is going to have fans. 2 out of 5. 5/9/18"
4.0,"I don't know what this tastes like, but it doesn't taste like bourbon. It's bourbon-ish.  I'm wondering if this year's release is vastly different? If Willett is finally using some of their own distillate instead of strictly sourcing? That being said, I really liked it! My ABC Store emailed that they had received some limited items and this one, at $33 was the most affordable, so I bit. Tried neat in a glenncairn, the nose is unique. Dry and Dusty. Musty orange, backed by dried spices and a light note of apple pipe tobacco. There was a mystery note that I couldn't place until I read another recent review that called it cedar. BINGO. Neat it enters with musty orange followed by very dry astringent oak. There is a light sweetness here, but it's in no way the traditional vanilla, caramel or toffee. A long drying finish with the musty citrus lingering. A tick on the hot side reminding you it's 101 proof. A splash had little effect on the nose and added cinnamon and chocolate to the palate, taming the astringency a great deal. Though my Scotch experience is limited, with a splash it reminded me of a good inexpensive blend, ala Monkey Shoulder. The nose on the empty glass smells of cinnamon bark. This pairs very well with a cigar. There is so much going on here, I've waited until I'm about a 1/3 of the way through the bottle to review, just to be sure. This is not one I'd seek out. but I'll definitely pick it up when I see it. Very different."
5.0,"Heeeeeeeeeere's Johnny! This reasonably priced bourbon is hard to find so when you see it, grab it. Rich caramel on the nose and a fruity burst on the tongue. Maybe apple or pear or peach? Which in all combinations makes it like a liquid gold version of apple pie. How American is that? It should be because Murica=Bourbon. So those blended Johnnys can ""Walker"" themselves out of the room. I'm drinking to the beat of the DRUM! Ba yum tss!"

2.0,I had a 50ml tasting of the 15 year and I really really enjoyed it. It was the top bourbon I'd tried to date and for the price outstanding value. A year later I managed to get a bottle and was very excited however this soon turned to disappointed when I tasted it and wondered what had changed. Then I saw they'd dropped the 15 year age statement off. Very poor form. The bottle was exactly the same just missing the 15 annotation. This version is a pale shadow of its dearly departed 15 year brother
5.0,Amazingly smooth and reasonably priced Kentucky bourbon.
5.0,"Hard to find, and sweet, as its charcoal filtered, but otherwise an excellent Willett bourbon. I prefer to the very similar - but higher proof and not charcoal filtered - Noah's Mill (even when its watered down to the same proof), likely as the filtering reducing some of the strange fruity cinnamon and un-bourbon-like taste otherwise found in Noah's Mill."

After first sip/acclamation, gingerbread becomes quite apparent. Warm gingerbread cake, raisins, butter and powdered sugar. 

Flavor: Rather neutral at first. Vanilla and light caramel. Macadamia nuts, toasted oats, white chocolate. Roasted/carmelized pear. Becomes more elegant and complex as it lingers.

Mouthfeel: Med-light body. Smooth and unabbrassive at first, then “Kentucky hug” sticks to back of cheeks and mid-throat. Definitely warms you up."

Dissolved 2 small ice cubes in a finger.  Burn taste was mellow. Second taste, no real flavor,  just hints of what bourbon could be.  Nothing at all in 3rd or 4th taste.  Best use is for ""bourbon""  cocktails  for people who don't like bourbon cocktails."

3.25,"Alright since it’s officially become mixed with actually Willett distillate it’s definetly changed profile from its original Aged stated NDP stuff....
This nose is massive peanut funk like almost that Evan Williams peanut funk but more dirty sock vibe (almost like the old Ezra 7yr 101) 
It’s taste is like almost salty and sweet peanut brittle with a gentle finish of sweetness. 
#important note my bottle has been 1/3 full for about two months now so oxidation has greatly effected this...
My recommendation is to let it breathe some as it softened the bitter rough vibes"

I don't love it, but it is quite decent for the price.  8/5/19."

3.5,"Not anywhere close to my favorite bourbon, but it's a great dessert whiskey or just everyday drink.  It has a flavor profile full of apple, caramel, vanilla, and spice.  It'd be great with a slice of apple pie and vanilla ice cream.  It's incredibly drinkable straight even at 101 proof - it's hard to believe that it's such high proof.

I think that it'd be great on ice or in certain mixed drinks as well as drinking straight.  It would also be great to share with family during the holidays.

It's a great value at MSRP."

4.25,"Taste:  Neat in glen cairn, 1.5 oz, then 2 drops water.

Nose (4.25): Fresh roasted peanuts and carmel hit you right away.  it is that smell you get at a baseball game when the beer vendor passes the peanut guy.  I loved it.  Brought back childhood memories.

Palate: (4.25)  Would be 5 if more complex or higher proof.  The nose turns to straight up peanut brittle with a hit of baking spice.  I am all in on this one.

Finish:  (4.25) Vanilla and heathbar at the end.  Just that little bit of chocolate makes me want more.  And then you get some cinnamon at the end.

Overall:  I have found an everyday drinker that rivals the imposters for twice the price.  This is straight up, no frills, traditional bourbon the way it should be.  It succeeds by NOT trying to be what it isn't.  I had trouble trying to find ways to knock it down!  If this were a cask strength.....straight 5!"

4.5,"Interesting. I've had many pours of bourbons over the years, and today I had a whiff of something very different.  I opened the bottle of private stock, and there it was, right in front of my nose, a very distinct smell of cinnamon red hot Tomales. Sweetness of the candy, and spiciness of the cinnamon. 
I hate hot tomales..... let's see.
In the glass, rye, cinnamon, bourbon spice, honey, strong vanilla, and 'drum roll'.......chocolate coated orange peel.
I hate chocolate coated orange peel..... this won't end well.
Tasting, basically the same as nose, with a nice amount of oak. Big barrel involved. Great char mixing with all that great spiciness, and unbelievable sweetness. The rye really shines through on this one. Excellent.
Finish is long, nice and flavorful.
I added a little water to it, and the taste became a chewy caramel chocolate candy. Liked the taste better with water, but the nose gets dulled.
Will be getting again, interested the heck outta me. If you want something different, I would strongly recommend this whiskey. Awesome stuff and at this price, no brainer."

Oak forward on the palate, but all of the flavors from the nose are present in the palate and finish. Long finish with a little heat and tingle, but exactly what you're looking for. I have to say that I'm really impressed with this one at $31.99. It doesn't have the light smoky finish that the Johnny Drum Black has, but I prefer it that way in this one. I tasted this one next to a Weller Reserve, and I'd pick Johnny Drum Private Stock every time. Willet made some delicious juice right here. 92/100."

3.5,"first try: 
on the nose it had something extra that twinged my nose more than just ethanol burn.  sweet bourbon with a hint of wet dog or dusty corn or cooked apples.  Hard to say.  

on the palate it was
HOT to the point it distracted from other notes.  maybe that was the cinnamon or its unrefined.  idk. even let it sit to mellow but no.  with water,  i finally was able to get to the other notes and get the cooked apples which added a tartness.  this was unlike any other bourbon and that's why i liked it even though it fought me the whole way.   looking forward to trying again and see what ice will do.   this wasn't the longest,  smoothest ride but a rickety wooden coaster that was basic and scared you a little.  

does anyone else do a screw cap under wax? that cap was a pain to crack open."

2.0,"Second go around. I feel like the body may be a little bit heavier and the legs just a little bit slower in the glass than I noticed before.  

Nose was again a bit dusty and astringent at first but opening up I do feel like I appreciate more cherries and leather.  There may be a little bit of baked apple pie behind it as well.

The palate definitely has some quick sweetness that is washed away with burn and a little toffee.  Two drops of water does something to bring about maple pecan pancakes, but doesn’t do much to change the pallet.

I really wanted to like this one. I have high hopes to find a wheated bourbon that isn’t such a pain in the ass to hunt down. Sadly I don’t think this is the one."

3.25,"The bottle had a layer of dust and significant force was required to open the twist off top.  Looked over for awhile, I let this one sit for a minute.  The color is a darker Golden with relatively quick legs for the proof.  The initial nose is ethanol but after sitting becomes more of a Apple/pear with slight caramel.  The palate starts with a bit of sour sweetness and evolves with caramel vanilla and slight oak on the end.  The finish is a lasting apple sweetness this being the first opening of the bottle."

Spicy, cinnamon red-hots dominate this slightly hot blend, although I didn’t get much of the “Apple” notes many others have touted. I do taste enough barrel spice to believe there are some old barrels blended with the young ones that put a hotter, ethanol based spin on the nose and front palate.  It finishes extra warm, spicy, and long. For around $30 this is a bargain"

Not my favorite, I tend to lean towards less spicy but still a good dram. Only my first glass so we shall see what the next glass tastes like.

Update...

Second day, second drink. So much better than the first. Not sure why, but it is.  Nice baking spices, smooth with some heat that isn’t overpowering. Nice proof as well.

4.0,"Before the review starts, as long as Willett/KBD continues to put wax on screw top bottles I’m going to continue clowning them for it. :)

Nose is pungent with toffee, candied nuts, prune, date, fig, pear, and maybe I’m hallucinating, but getting a hint of patchouli oil. All this riding on a bed of alcohol fumes underneath. That critique aside, this aroma is my jam.

Palate is bold and opens with rich nutty toffee and molasses notes with some of that fig and pear from the nose in the mid-palate. Quickly transitions to the medium length finish of hot cinnamon gummy bears and peppermint, which then morphs again into a lingering brittle and nut. Nice ride. 

Mouthfeel is unctuous; fatty and oily. Not sure if this is chill filtered or not but it sure doesn’t feel like it. 

I will say, this surprised me a bit even thought I do tend to be a fan of Willet expressions. While it does suffer from a little lack of complexity initially, the richness of the flavors and interesting finish make up for it. Lot more going on than it’s cheaper, inferior, higher proof cousin Pure Kentucky XO, and more rich and decadent than it’s sister Rowan’s Creek. An under the radar bourbon; at $45, “it’s a rebuy for me, dawg”"
