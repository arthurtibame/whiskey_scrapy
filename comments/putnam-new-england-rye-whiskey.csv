3.0,"Nose - Very gentle with notes of vanilla, oak, rye bread and a hint of caramel. 

Palate - Gentle with vanilla and a slight bit of honey that builds up and gives way to soft rye spices with pepper, cinnamon, cardamom and buttered toast. 

Finish - Mouth coating and warm with lingering spice and creaminess, but fades away too quick."
4.25,I’m a huge fan of this in an old fashion (my favorite to date) but at the price not sure some people would want to mix it.  Still solid neat or on the rocks.

4.0,"Very little rye exposure for me so this is a novice review.

Malty and perhaps a bit hot and peppery with clear oak notes in between and some vanilla too. Interesting how the sweetness develops with the rather sharp rye flavour.

Medium to short but hot finish"
5.0,A nice rye. Lots of typical rye spices and flavors mixed in with delicious barrel notes. Hardly any alcohol bite which makes for a seriously good sipper
