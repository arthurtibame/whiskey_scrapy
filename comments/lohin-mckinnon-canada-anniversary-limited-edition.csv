4.0,"The nose is lovely but delicate, with light peat smoke, rye spice and lemon zest. The palate is super wacky! very luscious, creamy texture. Malt sweetness, butter and shortbread cookies. The finish is delicious, with clove spice, butter biscuits, breadiness, and light smoke paired with sherry sweetness and rye."

5.0,"I have been looking to open this for some time and it did not disappoint. Upfront the peat is light, but interesting. Maybe a slight medicinal note mixed with honey or cereal sweetness. On the palate lots of baking spices come out; clove, all spice, cinnamon. With time oak notes start to emerge. The peat is there with a gentle earthy note, but never heavy. I found the pepper from Rye did not come out until the finish. This is a complicated, flavorful poor. Perhaps a bit young, but if you like interesting layered whisky, this is a must buy. Cheers!
