4.25,"Hmm nice drop. Some say peated Bunnabahain, caol ila, ardbeg. I'm learning to the latter especially on the nose...intense charcoal peat, honey, whisp of citrus. A review said its like stepping into a wet forest sauna and drinking in the moist air and I agree. Bit Ardbeg Groovish, not as deep charcoal as the committee but richer than the standard and more well rounded than both. The more I drink I'm like yeah I could imagine this to be a 18 Ardbeg. Nice drop. 4.25."
