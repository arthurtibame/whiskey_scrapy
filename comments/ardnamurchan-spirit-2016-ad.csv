3.75,"Back in my favourite bar sadly for the 3rd to last time for an unknown period of time. Weeks, months, years, never? No my liver hasn't failed I'm just cutting my travel down to days away rather than overnights. My projects are well under control and little need to be on the ground as much and the missus is switching contracts and ramping up work hours so I'm getting more hands on with the kids. As they say what's more important than family? Whisky is the correct answer so back to that... this is good.  Best on the night due to it's uniqueness but I think I may have preferred the ledaig 12 for all round sipping enjoyment. Anyway I'll let that one fester and splinter my sanity further. Very similar to the 2017 AD so I won't repeat notes, however not as much of a sherry influence but I think the bourban finished Ledaig is imprinting itself. Def a bit harsher spirit though. 3.75 I'll give it. A step down from the 4.25 of its double aged 1 year older brother."
