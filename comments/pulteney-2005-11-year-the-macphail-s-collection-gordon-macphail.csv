3.0,No. 2 on the Pulteney journey.  Sadly all 3 Pulteneys were average but they were on the cheap side. This was the last placed. The only one with slight green peppered bitterness to accompany the vanilla. In the end I didn't finish the 3 drams as they weren't really going anywhere special so I decided to mix them together with remnants of Cardhu 12 and Dalmore 15 IB...the combined sum was definitely worse than the individual parts!
