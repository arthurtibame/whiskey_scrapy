4.0,"While watching the Tigers take on those chumps from Cleveland (sorry you Ohio guys but you know how it is between us), I decided to treat myself to this 18 year old Oban. Thanks Lee for the generous sample. Oban is from the west coast of the Highland region. 43% ABV and unfortunately I believe it is both colored and chill filtered. The color is a yellow gold. 

The nose is bursting with strong fruity notes. Apricots, tangerine, oranges/orange peel and lemon. Jellied fruits as well like orange marmalade, and syrupy fruits like a cup of fruit cocktail. There is a slightly earthy note as well suggesting a light peating of the malt, and a blend of black and green tea. Lightly floral with maybe a touch of honey, and a light saltiness or brine, but nothing compared to Islay brine. Not an overly complex nose, mostly dominated by fruits, but quite nice. 

The palate arrives sweet but turns a little spicy. The taste echoes the nose pretty consistently. Apricots, nectarines, orange peel, peaches. A touch of floral honey, oak and apples. Wisps of peat smoke fade in and out, and occasionally give a good smoky smack to the tongue. I don't mean to up play the smoke because it's very subdued most of the time. There is something that is slightly bitter and sour at the same time, but it really works well. 

Medium to full bodied with a thick mouthfeel that turns dry. The finish is long and mostly dry but is warming. Fruity with a light oak undertone. 

This 18 year old expression is quite good, but it's fairly pricy. I don't know how the prices compare in other parts of the world, but here in MI it's just over $160. In my opinion it's nowhere near THAT good. The Little Bay is nearly as good with an almost identical flavor profile for $93 locally, and the 14 year old (which I haven't tried yet but have a bottle waiting for me) is $84. I'm guessing the 14 is also similar, so why not but a bottle of each of the ""lesser"" bottles for $15 more than the one bottle of the 18?, but I digress. If you have the means and want to give this one a try you won't be disappointed if you love all those bright stone fruits and citrus notes. 4.25. Cheers and thanks again to Lee for providing me with more of the good stuff than I could have hoped to buy on my own."

4.0,"I've spent the last few days entertaining family and letting them explore the dark side of whisky- Islay, peated scotch.  So, finally, after two days and 6-7 drams my dad spoke up ""Son, do you have anything that doesn't taste like licking charcoal?"".  Yeah, dad, yeah I do....

Oban 18 year old (Limited Edition).  It's a slightly elevated 43% alcohol by volume and is a beautiful deep gold in color.  The nose is incredibly complex:  with toffee/caramel covered apples and orchard fruit.  The fresh oak barrel sneaks in and brings a tidal wave of vanilla and peppered spice.  It makes you just want to lean in and take a bite.

The palate opens up soft, sweet and smooth before turning on you a bit with a nice pop of spice.  The barrel comes charging in and really wakes your mouth up- bitter and hot.  But, in a flash, it's gone and the slightly oily feel coats your tongue and preps you for the medium length, semi-dry finish.  This rollercoaster of sweet, smooth, bitter, spicy hot, oily to dry really is a bit out of control from start to finish, but it does leave you wanting more.  This is one extremely enjoyable dram.

Overall, it's miles above the 14 year old and a true highlight from the West Highlands.  The price leaves a bit to be desired (I think I paid around $130), but it's certainly worth a try.  A solid 4.25 stars.  Cheers."

4.0,"Very smooth.  My first impression is a light, flavorful tinge from the oil of the skin of an orange.  This is joined by a touch of vanilla.  This creates a very subtle “creamsicle” profile that is quite good.  It is certainly not over sweet or syrupy, but instead a fanciful dram that pleases.  I usually don’t go for the more floral, citrusy scotches but this one is quite good."

5.0,"Nose - Dark fruity malt, baked apples, dark honey, ozone? like this thick humid nose in the glass, dark unfiltered apple cider.

Taste - Smooth & creamy mouthfeel, dark sweet apple cider with a tiny hint of blackberries, light leather tart & sweet tobacco richness, dark floral honey, light hint of smoke.

Finish - Quickly fading apple cider creamy sweet, vanilla latte foam sweetness, tiny hint of white pepper tingle, hint of sweet tobacco/leather bittersweet.

Score - 90/100

Final Thoughts - This one had a great nose, very thick and viscous. It had this density of air like just before a huge thunderstorm. Very nice balance of malt & fruit on both the nose and palate but it has one of the shortest finishes ever. The creamy sweet quickly ramps down and then fades away, leaving only a minuscule alcohol tingle on the tongue. This one is definitely best neat, and it's dangerously sippable.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes

Would I buy a bottle? - Yes, but only if it was"

5.0,"A wonderful combination of orange marmalade, spice and honey.  Interestingly, it bears very little resemblance to the Oban 14, which is more of a brine and honey profile. Instead, the Oban 18 closely tracks the NAS Little Bay, with its orange and spice flavors, with added refinement.  I really enjoyed this and will look to add a bottle."

4.0,"Dark honey colored, medium bodied. mouthfeel: like chocolate melting in your mouth.

Nose: raisins, dates, honey, orange peel, a faint hint of smoke - like after the campfire has been out for a bit. After some time, some molasses, nutty sweetness, and faint sea salt caramel join the aroma. Everything blends together delightfully and smoothly. Really complex while maintaining a cohesive scent.

Palate: oranges, molasses, and caramel at the front. The middle develops more sea salt and mild smokiness, along with some brighter citrus flavor. The finish is smooth, mild, and medium length. It’s tasty and complex, but not overwhelming. There’s a big burst of sweet fruit and then a lingering smoke mixed with some dates and honey. Really interesting.

I think the Oban DE may still be my favorite Oban expression, but the 18 year is an excellent dram and I’m glad to have it on my shelf.

I’ll have to revisit this one down the line, and next time I’ll taste the other Oban’s after the 18 and see how they all line up for me."

4.0,This is a wonderful dram. Upon entry you get hit with red and green apple notes. You also get a pronounced honey note. The oak and spice swell then kick in but it's very refined and makes way for an ever so soft smoke taste on the long finish. The smoke and oak linger. I like this dram! 4/5.

4.5,"Although not the cheapest this is at the top of my list. 

All the flavours and smells are in perfect harmony, there is no competing for dominance here which is a testament to the ageing. 

There is a very light, yet ripe fruit nose about the scotch. Smoked honey, oranges and burnt caramel. 

Oily wet smoked grains mix with salted honey and slightly overripe apples, oranges, and bananas.

Nice long cocoa, dry finish that makes you crave another. This scotch is a perfect balance between the peaty smoke of islay, and the fruits of the highlands."

4.5,"I’ve enjoyed the 14 and my wife surprised me with a bottle of 18. Excellent, excellent drink.  Very much the same character as the 14 but just matured and I know that sounds obvious but it’s true. Mouth feel is just oily enough that it hangs around, peat and smoke are there just enough to keep me satisfied but not over powering. Nicely balanced, more so then the 14. I like young bottles of some distilleries but here the extra time just works, just a supremely satisfying pour. It’s a bit pricey and not common to come by so I’ll probably keep this as a Sunday choice."
3.5,"This is a case where I think I prefer the younger brother, and its more aggressive edge over the refined 18 year old.

First impression on the nose is actually rose petal, then there's orange, moss, cereal grains.

The palate has honey and orange, a little cinnamon. Warm, sweet finish.

This is good whisky, but I think the 14's more potent peat presence distinguishes it. This has a lot of nice qualities, but for other Highland malts of this profile, I'd usually pay less."

A few drops of water open fruit and citrus notes, while aftertaste develops more caramel and chocolate flavors.

1.5,"This review is for a bottle from 2017

It seems harsh to score a decent whisky zero.  But once you become an enthusiast of something, most of the time, you are just not impressed.  Why should that get an 87?  I also enjoy film, and even though I am careful about what films I choose to see, more than half of them are wasting my time.

This Oban 18 is trying to be a blend.  It is a complex whisky, but it doesn’t pick a direction.  And it doesn’t win the best directionless smooth sipper award.  Off the top of my head, from what I have open right now, Johnnie Walker Gold, which is far from spectacular, is something I would rather drink, for a flavor profile that has been buffed into a perfect sphere.  This Oban 18 has a little of everything, like Johnnie Gold, but it has some distracting spikes.  The caramel flavors are richer, but they are fighting the citrus and orchard fruits.  The saltiness is a courageous tip toe, but steps on the floral notes.  What does this whisky want to be?  I don’t know.  It’s a whisky that does not let the spirit shine through, but the cask influence has also not reached peak maturity; it’s a whisky that’s aiming for the rich and sweet profile; but also the fresh and fruity; it’s a whisky that has fallen off the highlands and drowned trying to swim to the islands.

I also don’t like how when this was first released several years ago, it was a premium limited release that was around $140; then, they decided to release it every year and make the price cheaper – I found my bottle for $100.  Now, I see some 2019 bottlings on shelves for close to $140 again.  Oban, make up your mind.

Score: 0 (forgettable)
How much does a bottle cost: $95-140
How much do I think a bottle is worth: $55"

Well... not exactly true.. I was 23 out of school and had a house on a lake (well across the street from a lake) but I had a boat slip and a boat, I felt accomplished then,... well until I spent the next 15 years getting beaten down with the brass knuckles of the real world that turns your optimism, idealism, and scholastic knowledge into bitter bitter wisdom though failure, pain, mistakes, doubt, the relentless pursuit of success - and saying in so many different ways “fuck you - I won’t let this system or any one of you hold me down”. ; so:  .. I’m super happy about all of it; having had experiences that many wouldn’t even believe if I told you.. (you might be asking yourself - where is this guy going with this?) when I was 23 I would take the boat over to this fancy restaurant in Michigan called “matter of taste” - at the time they had quite the expensive liquor collection- and better yet; my college roommate and best friend was the bartender there. I recall getting oban (free, and everything else) and I recall liking it (on ice) - but my go to at the time was chivas which I can barely choke down today. I don’t know why I liked it, but it seemed legit- however I was in no mind set to appreciate it like I can today. Here I am 18 years later buying a bottle - and holy crap is it good. The nose is pretty sexy, with a slight butterscotch lemon zest- but the palate; it tastes like s’mores, butterfinger, and raisins. But most excitingly it goes down like a chocolate shake mixed with Cayenne pepper and Coca Cola- fantastic. Smooth upon entry and fireworks on the way down.  👌🏼

I wish I could go back and have a chat with my 23 year old self and say - “lose the ice kid, let it move around your mouth and the whiskey will tell you an amazing story”."
