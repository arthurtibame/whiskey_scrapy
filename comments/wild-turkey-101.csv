3.25,It's become a go-to for me at a nice price point. More citrus and spice comes through with the longer aging and higher rye while still having a nice sweetness. Lingers kindly on the nose  without much of a burn. Very nice chilled or as an old fashioned

3.75,"My favorite bourbon in it’s price range. It won’t knock your socks off but it’s reliable and dependable like your ‘98 Honda Civic that you drove 300k miles. You can find it stocked at most bars, so it’s my go-to night out sipper."

1.75,"If this is the 101 level, I'm moving on to advanced classes. Smells of alcohol and straw notes. Taste is alcohol forward with new wood and straw. I can't find any complexity, just boozy notes and a fairly mild, going on bland taste. This might work in a cocktail where bourbon is more of an afterthought, but I couldn't see much use for it on its own."

Not super balanced but has complexity not seen under $20 and, as a mixer, that imbalance is corrected. Gets an unfair bad reputation!"

4.5,"I think this bourbon is judged way too critically and underrated. It's easy to sip, high proof, full of rich, pleasant flavors, widely available, and bang for the buck. You can mix it, spill it, throw it away on guests who care none for whiskey, and not feel much guilt or anger."
4.0,Nose of paint thinner or acetone but surprisingly not in an off-putting way. Further draws include dark cherry and caramel. Sip (with a splash of water) start very mild on the tip of the tongue with some mild burn in the center. Vanilla and cherry are strong. I don't get much brown sugar but the sweetness is obvious. Finishing with a mild smoke and French vanilla ice cream.
3.5,Not as much nite as I thought it would have. Uprising for the high proof. I immediately tasted cherry.

3.25,"Nose: Very strong vanilla notes.  Toasted oak
To a lesser degree. Does not have alcohol smell even when first poured.  

Palate: to be considered a “budget” bourbon it is full of flavor.  Caramel, oak, and cinnamon are the dominant flavors.  The mouthfeel is damn near perfect.  Coats the tongue nicely. 

Finish: medium finish of pepper and spice.  Have read reviews that say alcohol tastes resonates.  Not to me.  

I’ve probably rated this a little low at 3.25. Have tasted much higher rated (and pricier) bourbons that were not near as flavorful.  This would make a great daily drinker."
3.5,Bumping this one up to 3.5 stars as i'm really enjoying this for a $20 bourbon. I get a lot of notes from the Russell's Reserve in this but at a much nicer price point. I think the Wild Turkey products agree with my palate similar to the Elijah Craig products do.

3.75,"Nose: sweet corn, vanilla and oak, brown sugar bomb

This is truly a hidden gem that gets put in the bottom shelf category. Its probably the best bourbon in its price range and will hold up with bourbon twice its price, you really can't go wrong with turkey. Over a 100 proof for less than $25 is a win."

Nose: ethanol forward, some light smokiness and oak

Palate: about as smooth as you would expect for $20 bourbon, but its drinkable nonetheless.  I get some heavy oak and cherry overall. It tastes similar to a cherry cough syrup to me. Definitely a burn on the finish.

Overall, it's just ok for the price. I don't really get the hype on this, but it wasn't terrible. Could be a good mixer for a Manhattan since it is a high rye, but other than that I would always take BT or Jameson over it."

3.25,"Vanilla and sweet on the nose, followed by harsher oak/spice/cinnamon and some expected alcohol burn on deep inhales.  
Palate has some nice sweet vanilla and caramel with citrus and tart oak coming on at the end.  Mouth feel is okay, nothing too special.
Impressively long rye spice finish with a little more oak and sweet shining through. Gets a little tart at the end however. 

In short: lots of flavors going on, but not well mingled or balanced.  The flavors compete and dominate depending on how you sip, rather than compliment each other. 

Good for the price, just sips a little too hot for an everyday. The proof point is solid, and leads to a nice long finish that can get a little hot and out of hand.  Could use a few more years, but definitely no complaints for $20. Probably prefer Buffalo Trace or OGD 114 at the same price point"

4.0,"Wild Turkey gets a bad rep but this right here is a quintessential bourbon...for better or worse. The nose greets you with a hint of burned caramel and wood, opening up with time to fragrances of cherry and a very slight herbal quality. The taste is where I'd say this stands out when compared to other budget Bourbons. Frankly, it's delicious, if not a little by the numbers. Classic brown sugar and vanilla notes mix beautifully with the barrel spice you'd expect out of a higher proof bourbon. Wild Turkey gets a bad rep but that's no reason to turn your nose up at this sub $30 daily drinker."

3.0,Pretty spiced but just lacks that mouth feel. It’s fine. Probably a great mixer too.
4.0,"On the nose first alcohol varnish, then a sweet artificial fruity note on top, a bazooka bubblegum, with some caramel. There is a strong grain presence, that is unusual for me in Bourbon, however it is not overpowering like it could be (thinking of some new malt distilleries that haven't found their way yet). Vanilla.

Unlike many other Bourbons the palate entrance is not so sweet but bitter and tart, making way for more citrus acidity and then sweetness emerges. Woody and grainy. 

Texture is excellent. Oily mouthfill with some graininess. 

Finish is cinnamon and light ginger spice, and minty bitterness with chocolate notes. Long and slightly astringent."

4.0,"This is a very solid Bourbon. I have finally had the chance to try this higher proof offering from Wild Turkey. This is a very good Bourbon for $22 in my area and it is outstanding for the price. I tried this head to head with Evan Williams Bottled in Bond. While I prefer Evan Williams over Wild Turkey they are both very solid. Wild Turkey has a mild vanilla nose but the Oak jumps on you at the very beginning and is still there at the finish. However, there is a nice sweetness that shows up that mellows the Oak and makes it really nice. The overall flavor profile is just not me but it does mix well and with a little ice it is a good sipper. As I see it this is a solid addition to any bar and even if it does not fit your tastes exactly it is still good. So as I have space in my home bar I will try to have this in it. It is hard to go wrong with this Bourbon."

Palate is round and a little complex for the price point. Finish is rather short and heat lingers in throat.

The nose is vanilla and oak, which rounds out to toffee and molasses at the swallow.

The burn is not insignificant, but it also doesn't scorch the palate. In fact, once you process the burn out of your nasal cavity, that bit of heat dovetails beautifully with the dry barrel char. 

The barrel spices come through as a combination of lemon pepper and orange rind. (I'm guessing that's the rye.) Also has a cinnamon component that adds a little prickle at the end.

The finish is a tannic pucker, which merges with an inky, metallic coda. I'm so pleased with this, and surprised by it's complexity, and it will have a regular presence on my shelf."

Nose is delightful.  Deep, bready baking spices.  Nice vanilla coupled with burnt caramel.  Hint of cherry.  I’d venture to say this is the best nose on a $20 or less bourbon.  

Nice creamy texture.  Very light cinnamon sugar up front, transitions to the caramels and vanillas.  Rye really lingers on the back.

Such a good bourbon for the price.  The flavors are crisp but nothing over the top great.  Just solid through and through.  I would be good with this an as everyday drinker."

2.25,"Healthy amount of ethanol on the nose along with butterscotch and vanilla.
The alcohol on the nose is readily apparent on the palate but touches of vanilla, cinnamon, and oak help round it out.
The finish lingers with a hearty burn. The spiciness overwhelms any sweetness that was on the palate.

Not a bad bourbon but not something I’d sip on neat which is my preference. It’d make for some great mixed drinks I’m sure."

3.25,"Nose: spice and caramel and cherry

Palate: kinda bitter flavor and a lot of spice up front. No fruit or anything. Black pepper, typical with the wild turkeys I’ve had 

Finish: more black pepper and rye"

4.0,"This is a very nice bourbon, over ice with a little water, lovely bouquet, and a very nice palate. I have always been a Jim Beam lover, but this beats JB."
3.25,I love the vanilla/caramel sweetness contrasted with the peppery/charred oak spiciness. Great for the price!

4.0,"For the price, possibly the best widely available bourbon. Full, rich, a bit of barrel spice, not too sweet. Everything you could ever ask out of a budget bourbon, plus some. Also, it’s 101 proof. That can’t hurt."

4.0,"“Standard” bourbon vanilla and caramel on the nose. Followed by the same standard flavors, a bit of ethanol, and some cinnamon. Finish hangs on at 101 proof, and holds with a cinnamon baking spice flavor."

3.0,"Nose- caramel and stinging smell of alcohol 

Taste- caramel to start then leveling to a sweet with the alcohol present at all times. At times it is slightly harsh, but overall not bad. The spice of the whiskey gives way to a Sweet aftertaste that mellows into notes of apricot and vanilla.


Overall- as a budget whiskey it is a powerful whiskey worthy of being an “everyday driver” of any collection. While it won’t compete with its finer bred brethren, it suffices as on its own and the drinker will be stronger because of it."

3.25,"For an upstate weekend, I usually bring a bottle of something this can be found at an affordable price, is a departure from Jack Daniels (that is the staple whiskey that my good friend drinks) so I can expand horizons as well as we can drink over laughs.  I grabbed a 1 liter bottle of the 101 as this seemed to fit the bill this particular long weekend.  I peeled off for a  moment to do a tasting before I get back to more food and laughs. 

A light and airy nose with dense balanced aromas of vanilla, butterscotch and baking spices. As it breathes and opens, clover honey, Luxardo cherries and lemon zest add to the vanilla and baking spices, all which seem to push to the forward.

Lightly toasted marble rye bread spread with vanilla-honey, drizzled with caramel starts the palate. Toasted coconut adds a touch tropical influence. This all sounds overly sweet, but the sweetness is held in check by barrel spice and baking spices of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.  The texture is creamy with a medium weight density.

With some water, the spicy edginess is smoothed out and the dynamic of sweetness to spice is lessened; the extremes become more harmonious.  Water is recommended as it becomes a better dram. 

Spearmint and dill ride a medium length finish with barrel charcoal, vanilla and white pepper. 

When you drink this as a quick banger, it can be course and edgy.  However, if you slow down, tame it, it will bring you down a path that is tasty, enjoyable and rewarding.  I was pleasantly surprised that for a $30 liter whiskey can actually be a good sipper and bring a simple, rewarding pleasure.  Thanks @dubz480 for confirming this as a solid choice for the parameters earlier mentioned. [85/100][Tasted: 6/13/20]"

2.0,Pretty standard bourbon. Lots of corn and new barrel roughness. A bit of water tones it down. Still just a pretty good bourbon.
