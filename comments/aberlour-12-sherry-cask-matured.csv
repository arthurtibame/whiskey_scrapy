4.0,"Nose starts predominantly with sherried oak, but not one-note; you can sense the slight smokiness of the charred barrel and the sherry wrapped around it. Buttery brown sugar. Raisin is apparent. Surprisingly spicy in first taste. Bit of pepper. Sweet, with brown sugar, a hint of maple sugar, maybe even a wisp of chocolate. A toasty smokiness emerges after the first wave of sweet and spicy. Raisins and apple. Weirdly buttery, if that makes sense. Fairly strong alcohol bite for only being 43%."

3.0,"Add me to the 3.5 stars club.  This is a nice scotch.  I thought it did a good job of not over doing the sweetness and stayed balance with a sassy spicy / woody flavor.   

It's basically the Zoey Daschnele of scotch for me.  :-)   I'd definitely recommend as a low cost bottle to keep around."

5.0,Feb 2017.  Out of about a dozen Scotches tasted this ranks as number 2.  Love the nose.  Sherry casks are my favorite.  Butterscotch and caramel…toffee.  Yummy.

3.0,"Offered by a friend after a nice BBQ, I was quite curious for this 12 year old sherry cask matured Aberlour. Despite the sweet nose, I found but a moderate sweetness on the palate, accompanied by red fruits, caramel and some spices. Aftertaste was short but pleasing. Great to have in the cupboard for a rainy night!"

4.0,"Very nice not as complex as the A’bunagh , which I prefer but much cheaper so is a good alternative if you are on a budget. The Aberlour 12 has a sherry sweetness that is more supple.  I believe the Aberlour is probably one of the sweetest tasting scotch out there so if you like sweet bourbons you will like this scotch. 
Is not very complex but is very smooth and easy drinking dram.
I give it a 3.5 stars"

Its good but has little flavour complexity and a bit boring. I didn't even bother finishing it in the end as it wasn't worth hanging around for as I moved on to another event. 3.25"

Bottled at 40%abv, amber color.

On the nose, Strawberries, Sherry, Dim aroma but very pleasant, Cola, Almonds.

On the palate, Oak very pleasant, Spicy peppery, Very easy to enjoy, a little Salty and Apricots. Finish a little ashy medium long. 

Overall this is an 85 over 100, i would recommend it for the price tag and the easy drinking."
