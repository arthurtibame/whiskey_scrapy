3.0,"Sweet nose, cola notes. Tastes a bit like vanilla Coke, in a good way. Some wood. Gets slightly bitter towards the end, but otherwise a smooth, pleasant sipper. 1/25/18"
5.0,"If you like regular Tincup you will LOVE the 10yr variant. 

Smooth and tasty, the attached tin shot glass cries for a straight pour taste. I like it on the rocks, but this is so smooth it actually tastes great “neat”. 

I will definitely buy it again."

3.0,Very in the middle for me. Nice and smooth with vanilla. But also a touch thin and something odd

3.0,"This is a limited edition 10 yr old version of Tin Cup. It is also different from the standard release since it doesn't contain any malt whiskey. It is technically a Bourbon. The distillate is from MGP utilizing their 65% corn, 30% Rye and 5% malted barley mashbill. It's brought down to proof with Rocky Mountain water and bottled at 84 proof.
You get a pronounced sweet vanilla, toffee and butterscotch entry. Clove and tobacco on the mid pallette with oak kick on the finish. Minimal heat but there is a bit of a hug as the long finish lingers. Impressive for the proof. Much better pour than I thought going in. Worth buying a bottle for easy going sipping (between $45-$50).
This is really a solid effort, a 3.5/5."

4.0,"Break out the chainsaw, and cut your way through the zombie horde, if you're out of good bourbon to help take the edge off. Good bourbon right here.

Smells like honey-butterscotch at first whiff, turns into sweet tarts shortly after. Tastes similar to the four roses single barrel: typical honey and vanilla notes with very little bite."

3.0,Not bad but in my opinion the standard Tin Cup is just as enjoyable for less than half the money.

3.75,"The nose is very mild with vanilla, butterscotch, cherry syrup, brown sugar and a touch of oak and rye spiciness. Oak comes through stronger on the palate balanced by vanilla, while the rest of what was on the nose falls in line very subtly, while the rye stays nicely in the background but enough is there to have a presence. The finish is medium with lingering oak and vanilla while rye fades nicely. Overall a very nice whiskey to sip on and is deceivingly smooth, but at the same time could stand to be a bit more aggressive."
3.75,Not a bad sipper but lacking the layers I like
