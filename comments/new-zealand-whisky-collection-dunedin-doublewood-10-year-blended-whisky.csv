2.0,Nice concept.  Would like to see it in 5 years
3.0,"Very different whisky. It's like drinking a Xmas pudding, lots of flavours from the wood and not much else. Great with desserts."
2.0,This is a sweet and harsh whiskey. Not an easy finish. A bit of water finds butterscotch and softens up the finish. '2.5'
