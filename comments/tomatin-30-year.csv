4.0,"I saw this on the shelf at around 300, so I decided to grab a bottle and give it ago. Half a bottle later this is a total stunner. 
Nose: malt, pears, almost a sweet beer, leather, walnut
Palate: Really lively, with soft caramel, treacle, and almost a baked pie crust, this is followed by leather, very sweet tobacco, and dates.
Finish: long, oily, more sweet malt and leather, really lovely soft. 

Would buy again, compares well with many of my other more aged scotchs"

3.5,"Nose: A wood cabin on a perfect spring day, just warm enough to wake the walls from their winter slumber. A jar of honey sits on the kitchen table.

Palate: Interesting... Bready, slightly sweet, something slightly savory, like refried beans of all things. 

Finish: Long, with a hint of mint.

This was a difficult one to parse from one pour in a bar. Different and worthy of more investigation, but didn’t immediately make me covet a bottle."
