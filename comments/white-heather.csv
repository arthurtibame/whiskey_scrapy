2.0,"Nose: A generic whisky nose with a slight ethanol background. Raisin and brown sugar aromas.

      Palate: The arrival is soft and sweet, malty and slightly fruity. The development doesn’t deliver much. The texture is full and the mouthfeel agreeable. There is a very, very faint smoky tinge.

      Finish: Short and harmless. No bitter or sour notes.
      
      Uneventful, forgettable but not unpleasant. The grain spirit note is not metallic or intrusive. It’s reminiscent of Chivas Regal, but not in that class. Neat it’s too one-dimensional to be of interest but it is quaffable over ice with a splash of soda.
      
      As a mixer it develops a very brown sugar aroma and flavour that is too noticeable and makes it a little sickly. This is exacerbated when it is mixed with soft drink, which is not recommended.

      The White Heather blend was created in the 1930s by S. Campbell & Son. whisky blenders, who eventually became Campbell Distillers and also produced the Clan Campbell blend. It was a mid-range blend that appeared in several age statement expressions.

      Campbell Distillers was sold to Pernod Ricard and ceased trading in the 1980s and the White Heather blend disappeared from the UK at that time. However it continued in the Australia-Pacific region as a budget brand that had little relation to the original blend. The brand was eventually acquired by Chivas Bros. and finally became extinct around 2012.

I came across a bottle of this recently at a local liquor shop - they had discovered a case when moving their warehouse.  It was interesting to try for old time's sake, but I wouldn't buy another bottle.

      “Acceptable” : 2 stars."
