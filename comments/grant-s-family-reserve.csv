2.0,"I bought a bottle of Grant's back in the days when we first got married and lived by the discount liquor store. It was so cheap I couldn't pass it up, and the triangular bottle added a uniqueness factor. Still had a bit of this left when I took my candidacy exam in Feb. '14, but stat exam questions and a open fireplace finished it off that night.

It pales in comparison to my collection now, but was the smokiest bottle I owned back then. I like the dried hay reference, I think this is what kept me drinking it. Otherwise, a pale scotch best served with some ice and low expectations. Something needs to soften the harshness of the liquor that is imbalanced with the flavor profile."

2.0,"A bit to sharp, (meh) taste"
3.0,"Let's start on why you bought this, it's because it's cheap and my rating has taken that into consideration and I'm going to explain why. Everything is very light and subdued, good for mixing? Nose is light, wood spice, a bit fruity. On the Palate it's thin and got a bit of fruity glenfiddich to it, very grainy. Finish is short, alcohol burn and tiny whisp of smoke. 
  
  So I been drinking a lot of ""bottom shelf"" blends so far and for sub $20 ballantines finest is definitely the clear winner. Much better in my opinion, just way more flavour and oomph. Overall this whisky is very light there isn't much taste to it so it's good for mixing that is all."

3.0,"I spotted a handle of this blended scotch in a friend's kitchen and my interest was piqued... after all, I'm a huge fan of two of the component single malts in this blend - Balvenie and Glenfiddich.  There's a minor (and amusing) controversy regarding this blend... Jim Murray awarded it a ludicrously high score in his contentious Whisky Bible, and I've read more than a couple of online blogs penned by Single Malt partisans who scoff and call this bottom-shelf swill.  As always, the truth is somewhere in between.  I sampled Grant's out of a tumbler (no glencairn glass at my friend's apartment, I'm afraid) and I was immediately surprised by the pleasing and aromatic nose that the scotch gives off.  On the palate I also got some vanilla notes (perhaps from the Balvenie?) and also some pear and green apple (doubltess from the Glenfiddich).  The component grain whiskies do their part to fill in and the finish is pretty decent and slightly sweet (never cloying), without the harsh burn that you often get from blends in this price range.  As a point of comparison, this is slightly cheaper (and much better) than Johnnie Walker Red.  Its light and unassuming Speyside style also makes it, in my mind, the most versatile of the bottom shelf scotches that I've sampled (Cutty Sark being a more summer drink, and Ballantine's a more winter dram).  Grant's I think would be at home in either season."

2.5,"This is a decent and appealing Blended Scotch that offers a bit more than its competitors in the low-price range. The nose is soft and light, featuring toffee, citrus notes and hints of cinnamon. It's very much a Speyside style of a blend. Grant's Family Reserve tastes strong, sweet and spicy, and there is an apple note coming through. However, it's very young whisky, and the occasional metallic note can't be hidden. As a mixer, Grant's goes well into Coca Cola. Yet, this whisky can certainly be drunk neat, if your expectations are in accordance with its price.

3.0,"More of a 2.5 star than 3, Grant's was my go to inexpensive blend until I tried Ballentines Finest. Grants is still a solid choice for under $20, has a nice mellow sweet taste and smooth finish, just a little bit of alcohol bitterness. Finish is super short though. I actually enjoy the Grant's Ale Cask Reserve better (blue label, right around the $20 mark) but it isn't on here. I would give that one a solid 3 star."

4.0,Best value for price and flavor.  Needs a tad of water to make it bloom.  My everyday blended scotch.
2.0,"I spotted this bottom shelf, blended scotch at my local liquor store while browsing for something new.  I remembered that the U.K. only Ailsa Bay whisky I tried recently was a primary supplier for Grant's Family Reserve, so I figured I'd buy a cheap blend that I felt I was already a bit familiar with.  Plus, for $19, worst case scenario is that I had a bottle for when I wanted a scotch & soda.

The scotch & soda craving hit me tonight, so what the hell, I might as well pour a dram and give it a review neat, too.  It's a standard 80 proof and looks very thin in the Glencairn.  It produces no legs when giving it a spin.  On the nose there's a very faint oak and a bit of honey sweetness.  There isn't much happening on the tongue, either.  Weak oak tannins and muted vanilla.  There's no kick whatsoever, and it finishes really boring.  A tad flash of warmth that washes away quickly.

In soda, it really curbs the bitterness of Coke and makes a very sweet cocktail.  It'll get ya drunk, but that's about it.  I can't recommend it neat or in your cola of choice.  Very bland.  Look elsewhere, my friends.  Cheers."

Nice balance on the tongue, relative to other table whiskies like Canadian Club. I pick-up some oak,.Very short but not unpleasant finish. Glad I didn't pay for it...."

2.0,"I will give it just two stars, but these are really strong ones. It is really bland on the nose and the subtle scent it gives is rather sweet.
    The same goes for the taste. It's bland but then it gives a strong kick. There is nothing peculiar in there that would get a grip on my taste buds.
    So for now I was pretty harsh on it and gave a really negative review. But... Its real strength it's in blandness so to speak.
    I've tried it as an old fashoined with some bitters and it really lets everything shine through. You will still get some whiskey in there, which is nice, but as with most of the nicer ones, they dominate the field when it comes to cocktails, this just lets everything to get a say in the final outcome, which is very nice.
    So if you want something for cocktails, especially Old Fashioned, then go with this. You will be surprised how much the orange peel, the bitters and sugars will play with your senses whilst the whiskey plays the main tunes from the background."

3.0,"My dad surprised me with a bottle of this that he had bought about 30 years ago. It might not be the best whisky, but it sure as hell deserves a spot on my shelf for that alone. 

Nose is grapes, bit of honey and some vanilla. The taste is very bitter, with a bit of honey, a ton of grassy notes and some cinnamon sprinkled over it. 

Aftertaste is short and bitter. 

For the price, a decent whisky, it's about 15 bucks here. And the fact that this specific bottle is older than I am makes is special to me. (the other decades old bottle we had was a Red Label....that's almost empty). 

If you buy a new bottle, probably use it for mixing. Not too nice neat."

1.0,"Whisky 9 of the current batch of 12 affordable blends I'm rating.

Nose: Some cereal, oak, and slight sherry notes but it's not impressive. An odd rubbery character.

Palate: A hot alcohol arrival with oak tannins, like overbrewed tea.

Finish: Sour, and unfortunately not short, with a lingering burn.

This was more than just not great - it was rough and actively unpleasant neat, and it's definitely one of the worst widely known bottom-shelf blends. Drown it in a sweet mixer and it's almost acceptable but you still get that bitter and sour taste on the palate.

My only recommendation for this is to avoid it. There are much better blends available.

""Inferior"" : 1 star."

3.75,"I really do enjoy this blend. It is smooth enough to drink neat. There is a little smoke, iodine, malty honey, a touch of caramel and vanilla. It hits most of the tasting notes I enjoy! No it is not a special 18 yro single malt; but, it is a well crafted blend and is very consistent from year to year. And a bargain for $25-$30 for a 1.75 bottle."
2.5,"Hanging out on the bottom shelf with this scotch looking for value. Poured neat, light thin legs. Nose has mild fruit, pear, apple with some gentle malt honey and faint smoke. Soft better than expected mouthfeel. Palate is smoked honey, caramel malt and barrel wood with char. After some time in the glass a milk chocolate note develops . Grain alcohol is certainly there but not overdone. Finish is medium with drying wood, trailing smoke, char and malt. For the $15 I paid this is decent. Not a world beater or deep and complex just a nice cheap blend with good smoke to it. I would give the edge to Teachers but this is one of the better low cost blends. Take it over JW red or Dewars white (not sayin much).........76/100 blend score..........not sure if I like the funky bottle though"

On the nose, mainly ethanol with slight popcorn / pancake sweetness.

On the palette, a light to medium mouthfeel with burnt sugar tastes.  Adding water you open the flavour profile up and smooth the drink.

Not my favourite whisky, fairly generic taste to go with the generic label."
