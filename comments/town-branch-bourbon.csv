4.0,"[09.27.16] After the bourbon bracket shenanigans of 2014, I can't believe I never put a note in about this. Bracket winner that fall (over Crow, Dan Tucker and OYO, etc.), this is a fine whiskey with adequate barrel tang/spice. A bit mild but worth a try, especially if like me you find this under $30."

4.0,Mild sipper with notes of smokey vanilla and caramel. Mild aroma with light aftertaste. This is a good cigar bourbon as it doesn't overwhelm the palette.
4.0,Very smooth caramel taste. Great finish

3.0,Just OK. Not a fan of whiskey with strong oily notes. The Rye is much better in my opinion. Enjoyed neat.

2.0,The palette was pretty mild and I was trying to pick out notes when spice kicked in. After swallowing the spice turned to burn which I felt  all the way down to my stomach. Not unpleasant but not enjoyable. Subsequent sips and I started detecting a honey flavor and sweetness.

2.0,"This bourbon tastes like bananas...B-A-N-A-N-A-S.  Raw, sweet, pretty much a mixer.  I thing the yeast in my batch must have been screwed up.  For 99 cents I can get 3 lbs of bananas at the store and save the whiskey expense.


One star for the bourbon, one for the banana flavor."

Honey"
2.75,"I have allowed this bottle to sit for about a year after opening.  The initial banana flavor is still present, but not overpowering.  The bourbon now has a focused expression of brown sugar, honey and light bananas.  It tastes like banana bread."

2.5,"When tasted neat: Smooth through the whole tasting. Really no heat or any spice with this which seems lacking. I definitely sensed the woody/oak aromas with a slight bit of cherry/sugar smooth finish. When tasted on rocks: about the same, very smooth flavorful but could use a little more kick to increase the complexity. I would purchase again just because it was a good price and overall was an enjoyable bourbon."

2.25,"This stuff is weird. It tastes barrel finished in white wine. It tastes like a mix of cough syrup, white grape juice, and a splash of bourbon. It’s not offensive, but tastes unlike anything I have had. Try before you buy. Not my cup of tea."

3.75,"Some sentimental factors, but low key this is a fantastic, cheap bourbon.  Oak tobacco and apple on the nose.  Very smooth, tastes about like it smells; medium sweetness; unctuous texture.  Oak and faint licorice aftertaste"
2.0,Pretty vacant.
2.75,not much on the nose.  tastes light.  generally smooth.  the bourbon flavor comes as more of an after taste.  reminds me of a better version of the Minnesota whiskey.
