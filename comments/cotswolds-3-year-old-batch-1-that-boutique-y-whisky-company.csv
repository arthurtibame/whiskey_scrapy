2.75,"Sweet and syrupy, with a back note of oak and spice.  There’s some apple and grapefruit up front, but it melts away into quite a sour note.  It tastes young with the initial hit of un-matured alcohol, but overall it’s pleasant and easy to drink.  This might be a pretty decent dram with a few more years to mature."
