2.75,"Simple bourbon, a bit of alcohol burn for such a low proof. It’s young and you can tell lacks a lot of complexities that would come from an older bourbon. Not worth the price tag"

4.25,"Binny's store pick, 105.8 proof. This is exceptional. On the nose, it's so sweet with brown sugar, caramel, raisins. On the pallet, it's similar to the nose but a chocolate fudge brownie and then an oaky finish"
4.0,Slightly smoky. Dynamic and complex.
4.0,"Nose: honey, vanilla, subtle custard & orange peel, golden raisins 
Palate: corn, toffee, oak, dried fruits, slight rye spice
Finish: short, rye spice, dried fruits mid-palate"

2.25,"-Nose - Strong cherry initially with subtle mixed berry notes underneath. Faint floral tones.  Honey.
-Palate - Thin, light.  Young leather transitioning to cherry cough syrup.
-Finish - Brief and unforgettable.  Mild cinnamon taste with a hint of raspberry that comes back up."

4.0,"Sweet vanilla/leathery nose. 
After adding a few drops of water, I can definitely see what they mean by smooth. Vanilla, butterscotch, Carmel on the palate with some spice. 
NICE sweet, woody, vanilla finish."
3.0,Young taste. Nice finish. Nothing that will wow you but a solid bourbon. Going to leave it in the shelf for a bit to see if it opens up. Too pricey for me to consider a daily drinker but has that potential.

3.5,"Leather and cinnamon on the nose. Rich on the palate. Interestingly, this us straightforward and complex at the same time. Again, rich. Thick. Some honey, fruit. Light on the spice, but just enough. 4/11/19"

4.0,"Old Elk is on schedule to complete their distilling facility and warehouse by the end of the year in Fort Collins, Colorado. It was founded by Curt Richardson, the creator of Otterbox, which is also headquartered in Fort Collins.
Greg Metze at MGP was approached to create the mash bill and concept of Old Elk Bourbon. In fact, the bourbon was distilled at MGP during the time that Metze was the Master Distiller there, along with 2 other sources, one in Colorado and the other in New York. If it wasn't for the fact that it was distilled in three different states, Old Elk would qualify to be labeled as simply straight bourbon instead of ""blended.""
Greg Metze officially joined Old Elk as Master Distiller shortly after leaving MGP.
It's not just the mash bill that sets this bourbon apart, but also their slow proofing process. Most whiskey has water added to it over couple of days to achieve desired proof. Old Elk takes several weeks in order to retain some of the more volatile and delicate congeners that give the whiskey its flavor profile.
51% corn, 34% barley, and 15% rye. The nose is very subtle with sour candy, honey, caramel and cinnamon. The palate struck me as having flavors associated with unpeated Single Malt Scotch. Ginger, citrus fruit and zest, along with traditional bourbon flavors of vanilla and caramel. The finish is short with apples, more vanilla, and toasted pine nuts.
This is a very unique bourbon that is easy drinking, smooth, and delicate."

3.5,Light very little burn. Carmel finish
3.75,"Weighing in at under 90 proof, this will be a little thin, a little light.
Caramel, honey, and a little corn on the front.  Vanilla and dried fruit tempt you on the middle.  The finish is mostly cherry cough syrup with a little baking spice.  I would consider it a thin, short, light, finish, but the baking spice remains on the tongue after the ""hug"" is complete.  Not a bad bottle, but about $10 more expensive than it should be for what it is.  Interested to try the Cask/Barrel Strength version."
1.75,Harsh. Might make a good mixer ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ but the bottle is the coolest thing about this

3.25,Fairly easy drinker. Not much complexity. Nice burn with a medium finish
3.0,Pretty decent stuff. Nice floral sweet nose. Reminds me of four roses. Very light and easy drinking. Finish is moderate. Longer than I would have expected. Good but nothing outstanding.

3.0,Vanilla
3.5,"Color: dark gold

Aroma: cherries, baking spices, and classic bourbon.

Taste: initial spicy flavors spread out into gingerbread cake with cream cheese frosting.

Finish: the spice lingers for a sec and then it dissipates into warm cinnamon for a short amount of time.

Smooth factor: C"

3.25,"A good overall bourbon. Would agree it’s a bit overpriced as I don’t see it that much better than makers mark. A nice start, not the greatest finish out there but solid. If you’re stuck with this, you’re far from down on your luck, yet you’ll still feel there’s better out there."

Palate: Sugar, a little bit of vanilla, and medicinal notes. 

Finish: Fairly underwhelming. More of the same off the palate. 

Kinda disappointed at this offering at the price point. Feel like I’m just helping them cover their costs on the fancy bottle. 

Decent bourbon if price point was much lower."
3.75,Smooth enough with some ice

2.75,"Revisiting this one with a little bit of water after having it opened for a month now.
Nose - sweet and vanilla candy sugary smell.
Taste- starts sweet, mellow and smooth. Ends with a smooth very light heat and hints of maybe a cinnamon candy. 
Price and value - overall this bourbon is not going to be one of my go to drinks. It is not easy to find and price point of around 50$ with a pretty standard alcohol content. The bottle, topper and extra pour spout (if acquired in gift set) are all pluses for style points. The bourbon itself is good and smooth but nothing unique to me. I would add value if it was a cheaper price point and more available."
