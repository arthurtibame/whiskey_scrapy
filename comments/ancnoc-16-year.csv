null,Fruity. White wine. Apples. Slightly salty at times. Vanilla and nutty finish.
null,"Mild, with water has chocolate notes"
5.0,"Nose: vanilla, citrus zest, mineral tones, aniseed, lime tree, herbs, honey. Taste: dry, mineral, bittersweet, very balanced. Finish: rounded, full-bodied, warm, bitterish. Overall: a very decent and tasty dram"
4.0,I feel as though AnCnoc gets set aside a lot. Put on the shelf for another day awaiting the inevitable doom of dust. This bit will hopefully open up the eyes of the unsuspecting connoisseur to the beauty of this highland. Very oaky but it makes up for it with its fruity nature.

null,Tasted a bit medicinal. Quite strong midway through. Nice but not worth a bottle.
