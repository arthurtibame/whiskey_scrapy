3.0,"Some indeterminant spices and funky fruit notes at first; Cantaloupe? Apricots? Idk. They eventually fade to light honey, caramel and chocolate notes. The palate is smooth on the entry with light honey, caramel and chocolate. These notes continue through the medium finish and it ends a little bitter."
