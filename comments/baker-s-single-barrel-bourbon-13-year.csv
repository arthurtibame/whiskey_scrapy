4.25,"Very well balanced and full flavored whiskey. Lots of caramel, oak, and brown sugar that lingers and lingers. Coats the tongue and just sits with you for a bit. Definitely worth trying and buying if you see one."
4.25,"Nose: smooth nose caramel with a soft spice

Palate: flavor bomb!! Wow huge caramel notes along with some oak. Kentucky hug but so smooth going down. Beam funk is there

Finish: subtle oak and rich caramel sticking to the tongue"
3.0,This is smooth and has a good finish. A little hot at 107 proof. Just a little too smokey for me.

4.75,"Older version of the same, excellent stuff. Wish I could get ahold of a bottle. Cherry bomb, just like the previous bottling. Not over Oaked, week balanced."
4.25,Add a drop

5.0,"Nose - Caramel, vanilla, oak, cinnamon, and red apple. That beam peanut note is lurking in the background, but it's subtle. The nose is not hot at all.

Palate - First sip is thick and rich. Caramel, oak, vanilla, cinnamon and baking spices are the main players. The finish is long and rich, with brown sugar sweetness and oak spices lingering on the back palate. There's no alcohol burn at all, just a pleasant warmth. The intensity of the flavors and length of the finish is especially impressive given that this isn't a cask-strength bourbon.

This limited release is a home run for Beam. The flavors are great, and not just your typical Beam/Booker's profile but something unique. I think the 107 proof works well and creates a really balanced whiskey that lets the flavors shine through. It's also a relative bargain compared to most other limited edition releases."

5.0,The best tasting baker’s I have had yet. Sweet smell and finish.
5.0,"Rich, complex and sweet.  Smooth and unreal."
4.25,"The color is a dark amber that leaves oil clinging to the glass with every movement. The nose is light and fruity, with oak and hints of caramel with a little bit of char and caramel coming out at the end. For the age and proof, the nose is surprisingly gentle, even after letting it breathe for a while. The palate is mouth coating with oils and somewhat chewy with pepper, cinnamon, caramel apple, vanilla and a touch of butterscotch. It greatly expands on the palate. The finish is long with a lingering oaky cinnamon, while rich caramel apple and vanilla fade nicely together. It is a whiskey that tells you to take your time with it, to let it breathe and open up."
4.0,"N: Getting around the alcohol takes a bit but it's fruity with an apple hint
P: Carmel fruit forward that quickly escalated to a oak spice 
F: Hot and long. Very oaky and spicy."

4.75,"So I normally rate everything from the nose on down and then average my results for a composite.  Not going to do that with this one because this bottle is not the sum of its parts, but rather a bigger picture.  Let me break it down-

Wonderfully vibrant nose.  Oaky, butterscotchy, ethanol.  It smells like I remember Jim Beam's rickhouses when I did the distillery tour in June.  It is wonderful when a bourbon elicits a good memory rather than just the mental files of what it ""tastes like."" To me that is when a whiskey moves from really good to really special.

The palate is so balanced.  The spices, the caramels, the vanilla are in near perfect harmony.  Not one outshines the other.  I worried that this one might be too spicy, or too oaky, but it seems that 13 years in a barrel is just the right time.  The 107 proof is not too heavy and not too light-- like Goldilocks and the 3 Bears it seems ""just right.""

The finish gives you a warm hug.  Not the bear hug of a high proof bookers, and not the ""thanks for coming, see you later"" hug of a whiskey at or below 100 proof.  I call it a ""grandma hug""-  warm and welcoming.

This is a great bourbon, period, simple.  One part does not outshine the other.  To give perspective we shared this at tasting table with a 2016 Vanwinkle Estate 12 yr, 2019 GTS (was may favorite but this was super close), Parker's Heritage Char Rye (just to spice things up a bit-  reviews on that later, took my top spot for favorite rye of 2019!), and this year's OF Birthday.  That's big company, that is an awesome lineup!  The seven of us consistantly had Baker's 13 in our top 3.  I have no problem with this as a premium.  It far outkicks its coverage!"
4.25,"Came back to the Bakers twice, as the1st time I had a Thomas H Handy 1st so the pour was muted. 
Def a good pour 4.25/ 5 
Caramel
Brown Sugar
Vanilla
Enough proof but not too much.
I only drink neat & never add water to anything from 140+ proof on down. 
In today's environment ratings are more complicated if cost is factored in. 
So my rating is based on paying $100 - $120. 
As the price goes up rating goes to a 4. 
The bottle is very cool looking - I did not add anything in for the appearance but will look cool in any home bar"

4.75,"Cracked this beauty last night and let me tell you it lives up to the hype and some...

Rich caramel, vanilla, and burnt brown sugar offset by an array of baking spices. All in wonderful balance with oak, barrel char and some pepper on a long lingering finish. Really a lovely pour that is a departure from the sweet standard Baker's profile. This one is lovely! 

Cheers All and TGIF!!"
