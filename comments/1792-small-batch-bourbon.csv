3.5,Much more briny and punchy off the start than the Johnny Drum (Previous). Tastes of burnt green banana peel with residual sugars bubbling on the surface. Very long finish for a sub 94 proof bourbon. FULL FLAVOR. I can see why Chad loves this.

3.75,"Nose-I get tons of banana bread, a little ethanol on the nose but not much.  After letting it sit for a minute I get a little warm honey I think.  Obviously you get a little oak which you’ll get with almost any bourbon.  This smells absolutely delicious.

Taste- on first taste I got some of the sweetness I picked up on the nose but after another taste I pick up a lot of oak.  I get an oily mouthfeel which is nice and makes my mouth instantly water.  This is a pretty spicy pour in my opinion, but take that with a grain of salt as I prefer wheated bourbons.  A few drops of water really opens this up.  More vanilla on the nose is immediately noticeable.  The water really gives makes this bourbon shine.  Picking up a little cinnamon, I think maybe some nutmeg and I think I’m picking up some raisin.  The vanilla from the nose comes in slightly but it’s really light.

Finish-the finish for me has a long spicy finish.  A little pepper and some cinnamon.  The spice stays for awhile as well.  I also get the oak on the finish."

3.5,Rye spice. Caramel. Minty.  Can't really expect much more from a sub-$30 bottle. Will buy again.  I do not get 'hot' or 'burn' as others have noted. Very sippable - would not mix. Curious to try other expressions.

Palate: sweet vanilla, rye, baking spices (cinnamon, nutmeg), hint of cherry and apple

3.75,My second tasting of this was much better than the first. The first time I didn't get much other than oak. But on subsequent tastings it seemed to have settled down and I got big cherry notes on the pallet and not much bitterness from the barrel. I dig it and find it tough to rate. It's somewhere between a 3.75 and 3.5 for me but at the moment I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt and going with a 3.75. Maybe later tastings will change that.

3.75,Tasted this once in the past but couldn’t remember details as I only took a quick taste at a party. This time I went and bought a bottle. My thoughts are that this is a very good daily drinker that is very affordable and easy to find on the shelf. Not overly complicated bourbon but a pleasant easy drinking sweet bourbon that seems to find my mouth every day when I get home before the other dozens of bottles. At the $30 price point I think it’s a reasonable asking price.

Today , it finally dawned on me that this might be what Jack Daniels might be like if you upped the bottling proof and  didn't filter it with the Lincoln County Process.  Drink your bourbon!"

2.0,I was really looking forward to trying this after hearing many great reviews. Unfortunately I am a little disappointed. Very strong alcohol burn. Adding a few drops of water did open up the flavor. It could be that I just expected something completely different from the reviews.

3.25,Like it best on old fashioned
3.0,Disappointed with the first shot. I’m not a person who can described hints of this and scents of that. I can say it was not a totally favorable taste. With the second shot it is fine. With the third shot it tastes as good as any.

4.0,"Nose: caramel, vanilla, rye spice
Taste: spicy rye and sweet vanilla. A thick bourbon. 
Finish: medium finish. Starts with spice and moves into sweet. 

Old fashioned:  spice holds up well to the sweetness. A very good old fashioned."

2.5,"better nose than taste, a bit tart - okay, but I prefer others in the same price range ($20-30) - better after a few minutes"
2.75,"Good daily drinker. Not a high shelf bourbon, but for the price, would definitely buy again."
4.0,First Small Batch Bourbon I ever had. Very smooth. Tastes sweet. Tastes like it's had water added even when it's neat. Excellent!
