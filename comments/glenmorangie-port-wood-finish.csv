4.5,"Glenmorangie Port Wood Finish (by the sixteen men of Tain), Highland, 96 pts.  Big alcohol on the pour and certainly a drying finish, but a nice smooth body. Butterscotch and a vanilla sweetness, stewed apricots, peaches, light spice and a hint of tannin for balance.  Pleasant flavour and fairly easy drinking.  We picked this up in St. Martin in 2004 (I don’t actually drink that much scotch)."
