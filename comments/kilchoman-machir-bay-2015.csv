4.0,"Light citrus, peat, vanilla, and bacon on the nose. Smooth and salty palate, some cool mint and caramel, with a quick finish with lingering salt. Very good, may buy a bottle."

3.0,"A new purchase and, oh, it's a good'n! Worth looking for. Green peat on the nose with a bit of sour apple and sweet iodine. Incredibly sweet smoke and peat on the arrival. Gives way to some sour apple again. Great oily mouth feel. Finishes with alternating waves of sweet peat, smoke and a hint of mint. NAS, so young, and would be splendid with a little more time I suspect. Update: In the end, it's just too young and raw. Will be not be reserving shelf spot."

4.0,"This peated whisky seems to wear its youth as a badge of honor and more power to it! This is perhaps the brightest peated whisky I’ve tried. Where, say, Caol Ila tastes like a rainy autumn day, this tastes like a bright and sunny morning full of possibilities. Love the lemon citrus notes I’m finding amongst the peat and barley. This was a Christmas present which I’ve been happily and patiently stretching out for months now. Well worth the time."

Essayé lors de l'atelier aux Cavistes en 2018-02."

3.5,"Islay's youngest distillery (ESTḌ 2005) presents its 'Machir Bay' NAS expression with 46% ABV, natural color and non-chill filtered. Fairly simple on the nose, you get earthy, dusty peat smoke with lime juice and honey. The arrival is fresh, slightly spirity but well-composed with sweet spices, dry peatiness and some salted peanuts. Tasting briny, peppery and aromatic in the development, the finish is clean with slowly fading notes of dark chocolate and smoked ham. Kilchoman is definitely getting there, though rather expensive for such a young whisky.

4.0,"Out of the entry level medium peat Islay offerings, this is possibly my favorite. It noses beautifully, if a bit deceptively - only a little bit of smoke present, but plenty of vanilla and sea air, with hints of sawdust, damp earth, tropical fruit, and black pepper. The palate is at once sooty, sweet, and salty, as an earthy peatiness plays off the vanilla and sea salt, with a bit of tropical fruit salad off in the background. The finish is moderately long, slightly dry, and brings in those sawdust and pepper notes from the nose. Well worth seeking out!"

4.0,"It seems like it's been awhile since I've reviewed some new whisky so I set aside some time on this uncharacteristically warm Saturday in November to remedy this chore.  I have a nice 2oz sample of Machir Bay supplied by a friend.  It's a single malt blend of 3,4 and 5 year old scotch from the New Kids on the Islay block, Kilchoman.  It's non-chill filtered, no color added and comes in at a pleasant 92 proof.

As it rests in the Glencairn tasting glass it's a very light, straw colored offering that coats all sides of the glass with a nice, oily slick that settles slowly while producing some nice and silky thick legs.

It's been sitting about 10 minutes and the first nosing is very, very interesting.  I was expecting a good bit of peat, but it's very muted in the background.  It's overshadowed by some nice lemony zest and vanilla frosting sweetness.  I believe this was only finished in sherry casks for about 2 months, so I wasn't looking for much there.  I expected oak and peat.  Surprise, surprise.  

The first sip surprises just like the nose.  There's a nice hit of orchard fruit, a pop of lemon that's quickly overrun by peat and youthful oak vanilla.  It's a very lively and juicy experience.  The finish is the only thing that leaves a bit to be desired- it's pretty hot (as expected due to its overall youth) and that really wipes away everything in one fell swoop.  There's a bit of burn that lingers and gives it a less than desirable finish, but the overall flavor profile is nice.  Closer to 3.75 than 3.5 stars for sure.

I think these guys will definitely make their mark among the heavy hitters of Islay once their juice has rested 10 to 15+ years along the shores of Machir Bay.  This is a very nice start and coming in under $60 a bottle it's worth your time and money to help get them on their way.  Cheers."
4.0,"Agree with the smoky aroma, taste is strong.not bad"
4.0,"on the nose is light peat smoke with some earthy notes, however a slightly sweeter vanilla and oak and hay aroma comes in to hide the more heavy aromas.

the smoke hits you straight away on the palate. very dry yet has a sweetness in the middle that peaks with vanilla and honey before a spicy peppery note quickly comes and masks the sweetness. leaving a slightly  spicy finish with a tingling burn showing the younger side of this whisky.

overall very nice and as expected to be honest. however I prefer the 100% Islay to this."
