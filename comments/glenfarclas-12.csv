4.0,"I’m really enjoying this one.  Nose is sweet dried fruit(apricot, cherry), sweet spices and nuts (cinnamon, cloves, caramelized roasted nuts) and maybe a hint of smoked wood.  Palate sherry and hints of earth, malt, toffee and a hint of smoke.  Finish: Spicy and long, allspice, cinnamon, cloves, orange zest and sherry."

4.0,"Nice, friendly scotch with bright fruit and floral notes right up front. I get an very light whiff of smoke right at the beginning, but it vanishes is replaced by sweet fruit notes, maybe plum and pear, and a nice smooth caramel. There's also a barley flavor throughout that's perhaps a little bit tart.

It's a wonderful entry level Speyside that can be appreciated even by non-whiskey drinkers. I'll try to keep a bottle on hand whenever I can to convert others to our cult."
4.0,"Nose: honey and butter, dried fruit, gorse, less sharp than the 10, very sweet, vanilla
Body: thick, sharp, oily, rough and punchy, syrupy 
Palate: more sherry, cinnamon spice, pepper, sweet—hints of orange and biscuit
Finish: long and woody"
3.5,"Olfato: notas sherry, álcool, levemente floral, dulçor, apimentado, caramelo, açúcar mascavo, frutado, maçãs vermelhas, suave, amadeirado, mel e canela.

Palato: adocicado, apimentado de gengibre, sutilmente acre, amadeirado, maçãs, frutos secos, amargor gentil e álcool marcando presença.

Finalização: média, com dulçor, amargor e apimentado presentes e bem integrados entre si. Após 1 ou 2 minutos, no retrogosto, é possível perceber um suave sabor de ameixas em caldas, enquanto a boca seca e os sabores vêm à tona.

Impressões gerais: bom whisky e disponível no Brasil. Para que prefere whiskies mais frutados, o Glenfarclas 12 anos é uma ótima escolha, dado o seu preço quase imbatível e suas atrativas notas de sherry. No entanto, o álcool é uma constante em todos os sentidos da degustação, o que pode ser um problema para quem se incomoda muito com isso. Entretanto, ao adicionar algumas gotas de água, este whisky perde um pouco da pungência do álcool, mas mantém muito bem as características frutadas e adocicadas de um whisky maturado em barris ex-sherry. Recomendo para iniciantes em single malts, para degustação na forma pura ou com algumas gotas de água na taça."

Taste: Nicely malty with toffee and sherry. Earthly feel with hints of smoke.

Finish: Long with spices, fruits and warming sherry. Oranges and cinnamon being the major factors.

Balance: After a modest start, gets better in every step. Delicate nose, nice and subtle taste and a big lasting finish. Has big sherry influence, yet I still like it!"

3.0,"On its own merits, and on quality-for-dollar, it probably deserves 4 stars. But I have to admit that this one doesn't appeal to my tastes personally--I've had an open bottle for a very long time, and I find the profile much too sweet. Light smoke, the classic sherried berries and baking apples and grapes, oodles of heather. But there are just so many sherried whiskies out there, and I wish this one dialled back the sweetness a bit or felt a bit more substantial."

Actually reminded me of those honey lemon Ricola cough drops I used to steal and eat like candy as a kid when my sister was sick lol... But in a good way minus the medicinal notes. The palate carries that sherried influence with dried fruits, raw honey and a maltiness giving way to some spice. I get a medium finish with spices and honey."

3.0,"Have a special bottling of this called ""2004 vintage"". It is 11 years old, matured in special hogshead casks, and bottled at cask strength. Exported exclusively for the Dutch market, so you'll probably won't find. Neat, it's a sherry bomb, leaving no room for subtleties. When water is added, the sherry leaves behind its arrogant dominance and leaves room for honey, vanilla, and the darkest of chocolate.  Pretty fun whisky to try, but I've had much better whisky for this price (70 euros)."

Added water seems to dull the sherry note but reveals a hint of old musty oak that I love. Bright fresh burst of fruits on the palate with bold spices, cedar and a satisfying little kick. Finishes long and fruity, bittersweet. A touch medicinal, hint of mint. A balanced, mature, satisfying, quality dram, will definitely buy older bottlings, I think this would age well. Dry glass: hearty banana bread."

3.75,"Ah, Glenfarclas! Family-owned distillery, direct-fired stills and this unmistakable, sherry-infused style. Typical sweet fruity Speyside aroma that is full of oranges, apricots and plums with a touch of cinnamon and cloves. A robust nose. The arrival is mouth-watering, measured and zesty. Fresh youthfulness reminds that this Single Malt is only 12 years old, and yet it is full-bodied and rich with dried fruits, raisins and nuts. A medium finish with Christmas spices, dark chocolate and jelly babies in the aftertaste underscores that this whisky is a good choice.

4.0,"Pours the color of a glowing ember. The nose is tantalizingly sweet—tiramisu, heather, ripe wine grapes just before the frost, and hints of tropical fruit. The nose would betray an overly sweet malt, but actually (and thankfully) the palate is nutty and spiceful; candied walnuts, salted cashews, heather honey, and spiced fruit play well with a rich malt base. Towards the back of the palate the tannins and wood flavors dominate, again balancing out a sweetness that would otherwise be overwhelming. The finish is pleasant, musty, prickly, and spicy, while the aftertaste is reminiscent of grape must, sweet nuttiness, and chocolate cherries. Overall, a truly captivating whisky. As far as sherried malts go, it's a step above Aberlour and would compete with The Glenrothes 1998. I'd prefer the '98 to this one for its luxurious tropical fruit notes and creaminess, but the Glenfarclas 12 is truly a fine dram. Like others have noted, the 12 gets one excited to try older Glenfarclas expressions."

4.0,"There's a heavy nose with strawberry, dark red fruits, cherry fruit chews, and amaretto syrup. 

Light palate, watery mouthfeel, vanilla ice cream, more amaretto; the integrity of the sherry influence follows throughout.

A light tobacco like finish with cherry and vanilla. The finish is what bumps the score up for me.

4.0,"Visual:  In the glass it is a medium gold. Long, thin legs after a swirl.

Nose:  Initially, I pick up a wet asphalt aroma, like pavement after a brief rain, along with a little alcohol and grassiness. After several minutes of opening up, sweet notes of vanilla, toffee, white chocolate, and baking spices come to the fore. Some toast, as well. I really like the nose on this one after it has had a chance to sit for a while.

Palate: It’s honey sweet and malty on initial tasting, with a faint smoke in the background. The mid palate brings some spice and a difficult to pinpoint vegetal note.  Carrots?  Celery seed? Both? Also some cereal grains in the mix. There is an earthy quality to the flavor on swallowing.

Finish:  The finish is medium length, with a little dark chocolate bitterness. It’s the good kind of bitterness.

The empty glass has aromas of dried fruits and trail mix.

I’m impressed with the complexity and balance of this Highland malt. I think I’ll be revisiting this one.  It’s on the lower end of 4 stars for me. Certainly respectable."

I actually avoided trying this for a while based on some of the negative reviews out there but I suspect it may be from people who nose and taste it right away, this is one needed time to breathe.

Nose: Beautiful and pungent, my wife smelled it across the room. Citrus, Caramel, Light smoke and Honey nut cheerios? (Used to love it as a kid on saturday mornings)

Taste: Not a very creamy mouthfeel and kinda thin. Sweet right off the bat than some Licorice, Baked apple, Raisins, Ginger, rich flavor despite the thin body.

Finish: The initial sweetness fades away and reveals some walnuts, oak and dark chocolate on the tail end. Fairly long and evolving.

One of the best 12 year olds I've tried so far. If all direct-fired still Scotches are like this I will seek out more.

This one is going into the rotation."

3.0,"Deep sherried whiskies, to me, take some time to understand and appreciate.  Similar, in essence, to adapting and appreciating a good, peated whisky.  I recall having tasting a Macallan the first time and I was not in tune to the experience: the deeply rooted sherried flavor and the impression was one of a mediocre whisky.  But time changes our perceptions as our wisdom and knowledge increases.  Where am I going with this?  Now having more appreciation for sherried whiskies, I was looking forward to tasting this Glenfarclas; this being my first.  I was eager to compare to the baseline Macallan.
  
  Raisins and lightly toasted bread (a similar aroma to Raisin Bran) are initially met.  The obvious sherry notes are joined with a nuttiness and spicy nutmeg.  Toffee sweetness overtones the fruity orange peel and apple notes.  Honey and vanilla are sprinkled in between.  A touch or char hidden in the depths is drawn out over time.  Be patient!
  
  Arrives gently, soft and sweet.  Brown sugar, vanilla, prunes, allspice and cloves compose the palate all balanced.  Near the fade to the finish, with some time on the palate, the sweet tea with honey flavors work their way and deliver the finish.
  
  The finish is medium in length and exposes flavors not smelled nor tasted on the palate.  Slightly ginger and tannic, yet revealing a brown sugar sweetness and cinnamon spiciness.  The final fade brings a nice unique flavor for Welch’s Grape Jelly/Jam or an almost and artificial grape flavor, like grape soda, and ultimately, exiting with toasted coconut.
  
  The thought that kept coming to my mind with this experience is ‘Seamless’  The transition from aroma to arrival to delivery and finish are greeted and finished in one fluid progression with little obvious abruption.  Soft and creamy and slightly warming.  A definite slow sipper that only improves over time, and in that time, you are rewarded.  As a comparative, I found this to be slightly more enjoyable than Macallan 12.  A well-crafted and thoroughly enjoyable sherried whisky.  Complex yet approachable.  A quiet gem!  [Dry Glass: Heath candy bar][$56][87/100][Tasted: 9/15/17]."

3.0,"Glenfarclas just makes whiskies.  I love ugly bottles, because it tells me that the distillery is not trying to sell you “an experience.”  Fuck that experience shit.  Don’t tell me how to think.  Especially when alcohol is involved.  An independent bottler would look at Glenfarclas’s ugly-ass tin and bottle and ask “What are you doing?”  Only Longrow has Glenfarclas beat in the ugly competition.  But you know what?  This 12 year old cost me $37.
  
  NOSE: Powerful.  Wine.  I was surprised how much fresh grape peel and apple peel I was getting from the nose.  Having been lucky enough to have tried some 25 year old and family cask Glenfarclas (bargains for the ages), I was expecting a hit of sherry.  Not so.  Sherry is there, but only after your nose acclimates to the sharp fruit notes.  Lots of grass.
  
  PALATE: Initially, it’s nothing like the nose.  It’s light and rounded.  The flavors take some time to reveal, but there is quite a bit complexity.  Lots of fresh fruitiness: apricots, unripe honeydew, honey, Gala apple.  Some sherry influence, but once again, it’s subdued.  Towards the end, a lot of malt, almost like a Scottish ale; and very mild spiciness.
  
  FINISH: So, at my normal pace for a 12 year old, of taking about 30 minutes to finish a 1.5 ounce-ish pour, there is no finish to speak of.  You speed it up, and drink (ahem, taste) twice as fast and you get some finish.  It actually gets pretty intensely spicy with cloves and nutmeg.
  
  With water, and with time/oxygen, the nose and palate become more similar.  The nose rounds out, and the palate becomes a little more spiky with spicy notes.
  
  VERDICT: So, I last had this side by side with Macallan 12 Sherry 43% ABV.  Unfortunately, the experience justified the extra bucks Macallan is charging.  Glenfarclas is just anemic and watery in comparison, even though it is also 43%.  I want to love Glenfarclas so much, but it does make Macallan look good, and there is a little bit of a you-get-what-you-pay-for lesson.  Still, have it side-by-side with Glenfiddich 12, and Glenfarclas is gargantuan.  MARK: 78/100.  If you can find it for under $40, it’s worth it."

4.0,"Nose: Elegance personified. Initially it may seem simple and somewhat homogenized but there is depth to be explored. Allowing time for development in the glass is repaid by the revelation of lovely gentle oak, sherry (lots of sherry) and malt aromas, all packaged as a seamless whole. There are also some hints of fresh-cut mint, dry spices and citrus (notably orange) zest, and a lightly musky floral tone.

Palate: Malty and sherry-rich arrival with a solid texture. Turning slightly resinous and dry as it develops but with sherry overtones and warm spicy notes (ginger) weaving throughout against a subtle dark orange background. The more you taste it, the more becomes apparent.

Finish: Medium/long, grapey, oaky and a little oily. Somewhat spicy, a touch hot and with an interesting tannic overtone.

This current batch of the 12 year old is possibly the best I've tasted. It's in really top form.

Like all Glenfarclas this whisky requires time for you to get acquainted. Don't hurry the experience. Engage this whisky at its own pace and give it time to open up, otherwise you are only getting a hint of what it has to offer. The nose is excellent but it's wrapped up tight under a blanket of sherry and oak, which a dash of water helps penetrate.

Glenfarclas 12 is sometimes considered a young or introductory malt while some other whiskies are thought to be well matured at that age.  I guess it’s because there are so many much older age statement whiskies in the Glenfarclas stable, so comparatively this seems like one of the “youngsters”.  There's also the fact that Glenfarclas is a very big distillate that can take long maturation in its stride, and yes it does benefit from this.

However for me 10-15 years is the point where Glenfarclas first becomes really interesting. The 10 year old is fruity and cereal in nature with floral notes from the new-make still prominent. The 15 is much more dark fruit cake and the wood influence is on the ascendent. This 12 is right in the middle, shows some of both these character profiles, and has great balance.

“Very Good” : 4 stars"
3.0,"Had this on a United flight, apparently the distillery struck a deal and now the 12 year is on every United flight.  Glenfarclas's nose isn't a classic sherry bomb as I might have expected from its reputation.  It does have a wine-like character, but also a lot of apple (like cider, as my wife put it), and a bit of varnish.  The palate is the best part, again with apple leading the way, some grape, a lot of herbal spiciness, and a roast nut quality that leaves a smoky or mildly sulfurous impression.  The finish is disappointingly short and is more of a bitter tingle, like resin, with just a hint of tart fruitiness.  I'd take Macallan 12 over Glenfarclas 12 any day, due to the letdown at the finish, but I remain excited to try the famous 17."

3.0,"On the nose, the first note I got, of all things, was pine trees. The sherry and cinnamon danced its way in afterward. I get an oak smell that's not too forward as well. Hope the palate is as good. With 43% ABV, let's leave this alone. Oh, a little burn, but apples, crust, vanilla, wood chip, walnuts.. not bad at all. A smidgen hot though maybe. Let's just do two SMALL drops of aqua. Man, I could nose this all day and night. More tropical flavors made their way in. A little cheaper than the Glendronach 12, but good as well. This is one to ponder. The finish is medium, but a little alcohol still there, and that's my only ""complaint"". 3.5. This is ""Cinnamon Girl"" by Neil Young. Thanks to Scott for the sample!"

3.0,"I was able to give this one a go thanks to our distillery group.  I’ve previously tried the 10, 21 and 25 year old- none of which really impressed me much.  Especially the 10 year because it seemed a lot more harsh than I expected, but then again it is pretty young by scotch standards.

There isn’t a whole lot of complexity to any Glenfarclas I’ve tried and this 12 year doesn’t buck that trend.  It was pretty sweet with typical sherry notes with hints of toffee and oak rounding things out.

It does come off as pretty smooth when compared to the 10 and the finish is just warming enough to make it mostly enjoyable.  I don’t believe I’d seek out any more bottles from these guys, but I’m glad I was able to try this one because it somewhat redeemed itself IMO.

Thanks to Scott for supplying this one.  It’s a solid 3.25-3.5 stars.  Cheers."
4.0,"It's taken me a while to get to the point where I feel I can review this whisky, as it sent me on a rollercoaster ride initially. My first dram was quite pleasant and what I expected - a nutty, slightly spicy, lightly fruited dram that wore its sherry influence on its sleeve, but in that particular Glenfarclas style. It fell, as I expected, somewhere between the 10 and 15 year olds for complexity and body. My second dram was a disaster - I'm assuming either my taste buds were out of sorts, or I accidentally grabbed a dirty glass, or something, but it tasted foul and I almost didn't come back for a third dram. But I did, and then a fourth, and I'm happy to say that Dram #2 was an aberrance, nothing more. It is precisely what one comes to expect from Glenfarclas - dried fruits, nuts, a lightly smoky black tea quality (think Russian Caravan), a pinch of mint, a little something sweet from the bakery. It suffers a bit from comparison to older expressions, which simply bring greater complexity and longer finishes to the table, but it is an immensely drinkable sherried single malt priced quite favorably. For me, there's no need to bother with the 10 Year when I can buy a bottle of this for only an extra $7-10."
4.0,"Stop number 38 on the SDT is Glenfarclas. A family owned Speyside distillery rather than corporate owned, Glenfarclas is rather unique in the scotch world. Not only are they independently owned and operated, but they are one of only a handful of distilleries that still uses direct fired stills. 
I have reviewed the 10 year old and the 25 and loved them both. Let's see how well this 12 year old fares. Bottled at 43% ABV and as with all Glenfarclas expressions (I believe) it is non chill filtered and natural color. This one is a beautiful golden brown, like a perfectly toasted marshmallow. 

A very nice sherry nose to start things off. Dense spiced Christmas fruitcake. Nutmeg, cinnamon and clove. Definite mint and black licorice. Some low levels of fruit, plums and raisins mostly, but also some chocolate oranges and caramel apples. A light nuttiness, maybe almonds. Butterscotch and toffee. Not too complex, but great regardless. 

Sweet and lightly spicy on the palate. Minty sherry. The spice level increases a little the more you drink. Charred oak, black tea and baking spices. Mild toffee and butterscotch. Like the nose, it's not too complex, but immensely drinkable. 

Light to medium bodied. A light oiliness and mouthwatering. 
Medium length finish. Pepper, sherry and tea. Fairly dry

I was in the mood for a sweet sherried whisky tonight, and while this was not exactly sweet, it is very good. From what I remember, this is years above the 10 year old (2 to be exact lol). No bitterness in the finish like the 25 year old, but it lacks the complexity that comes with longer maturation. My love of Glenfarclas has only been strengthened and I still need to try the 17 and 21 year olds. While I would love to give this one a 4, I think a 3.75 is more appropriate. Thanks to Scott for the sample. 
Cheers"

3.75,"Glenfarclas is a good brand to sample and see what the same whisky tastes like over a span of being aged 12-25 years. Their bottles are relatively cheap and easy to find. The 12 is a solid single malt that any scotch fan will enjoy. It doesn’t have anything big that stands out but it doesn’t have anything bad either. As you try the Glenfarclas range of bottles you will find the biggest change is the wood smoke increases a little bit each time. From the 12,15,17,21 and 25 year olds. This is a great one to keep at home that won’t break the bank."

4.0,"Glenfarclas tasting night at The Oak Barrel, Sydney, 4 July 2019. Whisky #1

Nose: Sherry, malt, soft fruit and a fragrant, honeyed musk note. There's the alluring aroma of a good oak cask in the background and an ultra-light smoky note but it's not peat smoke. Water brings out a little caramel on the nose.

Palate: Sweetly spicy and expansive on the arrival with dark fruit cake and walnut bread flavours, it develops more dry spices and very soft tannins as it develops. The texture is firm and confident with a slight creaminess. With water some light maple syrup notes emerge.

Finish: Medium. Spicy dark fruits and a medium-dry sherry aftertaste.

A very friendly 12 year old single malt that offers good value. It's broad, rich and full and has great balance but like all Glenfarclas this whisky needs more time to rest in the glass than you might think. Don't rush it.

It's only when you taste this malt in direct A-B comparison with older Glenfarclas expressions that it seems at all wanting, and then it's not because of any fault with the 12, but simply that the older whiskies are even better. It's one of my all-time favourites and a standby.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

4.25,"Maybe a bit rough and ready for a 12 year old whiskey, compared to Glenmorangie's Lasanta, Quinta Ruban and for instance the Redbreast 12. The taste itself is outstanding, spicy, fruity and not overly sweet, very well balanced. Definitely a big step up over the Glenmorangie 10. And more outspoken in both flavor and nose than the slightly timid  Lasanta and even the Redbreast 12. But the mouthfeel is somewhat less smooth, with a little alcohol burn on the tongue and back in the throat and a tiny bit more watery than the other whiskeys I mentioned, it lacks a luxurious mouth feel. Price-quality wise however this one beats the others. 30 euro for a one liter bottle, whereas the other bottles I mentioned (excluding the Glenmorangie 10) cost more than 40 euro for a 70cl bottle! And on overal balance of flavor; sweets, spice and fruitiness (not including depth of flavor) I may prefer this Glenfarclas over every Glenmorangie offering I tried, with the Nectar d'Or as exception."

⠀
Taste: A somewhat complex mix of notes that starts out with the some malty sweetness, but ventures more into a tart fruity sweetness. Not so much berry fruits, but maybe more citric and bold on the tongue. Quite strong notes of spicy pepper here and certainly some astringency. Think of fruit, pepper, moderate tannins, and a little bit if earthy smoke. It took a moment to appreciate the taste as it wasn't what i was expecting after the nose. ⠀ ⠀

The texture of the whiskey feels somewhat thick on the tongue and seems a little oily, but fades away somewhat quickly into a dry and somewhat hot medium finish. As the heat fades, I seem to get some allspice and other bright baking spice notes emerging here and there. ⠀
⠀
This is an interesting whisky and I think it offers a lot at the 12 year mark. It's not as refined and rich as an older highland malt might be, but it has a lot of character and I enjoyed trying it. I might pick up a bottle in the future. Due to its spiciness, I think it drinks hotter than the average 43% highland scotch, but sometimes that is favorable."

It has the honey malt and figgy fruit from the sherry that you expect in a Glenfarclas.  This is too oaky, at least that is what I think is the problem.  There is an astringency to this that lasts for minutes on the finish.  It reminds me of the effect a partially ripe persimmon had on me as a foolish young boy.

3.5,"I really like sherried scotch, I mean yeah its fantastic. Have been interested in this GF for some time. I do appreciate the family business model along with the direct fire heating, last of dying breed. Poured neat, nose is standard candied sugared fruits like figs , orange and berries. Which is to say its right in my wheelhouse. Honey malt and toasted oak join in as well. Some say there is smoke.... yeah ill buy that only its smelling the fire the day after its out. Mouthfeel is thinner than I expected from the stills they use but its not a problem. Palate comes in with malty barley sugars, more dark fruit along with not quite smoky singed wood notes. I was hoping for some coffee light peat notes which almost develop but fade off with just a hint. Flavors are not deep but nor is it thin either. I feel more time in the barrel would do wonders as it tastes a bit young. Finish is medium  with traditional fading malt and barrel notes supported by distant jammy fruits.  I like this but it cant measure up to sherry monsters such as Glendronach or for me Mac 12. Im a fan but as others have mentioned the older stock may be the way to go. Totally enjoyable despite any drawbacks though so......85/100.....I will most likely swim upstream with this distiller leaving this price point to others. I paid $45 but saw this in NH for $36  all the time, at that price point its an easy repurchase. People paying $50+ just say no"

3.0,"Really nothing special for me. Not very smooth, kinda light on the mouthfeel and finish."
3.75,Very smooth. Caramel layered on top of a floral meadow. Finish fades away as smoothly as it came. I’ve had the 12 and 10 and think I prefer the wood notes and mild spice of the 10 over this.

3.0,Sherry notes are very forward on the nose along with hints of grass and toasted cereal.  The initial taste is fruity with apple and something sweet.   Not much barrel spice and a bit of smoke or that toasted cereal again. It starts off smooth but there is some cinnamon burn on the finish that I seem to get from most Highland Scotches.

3.75,"Initial taste provided me parts of green apple, cherries, and a bit of black licorice.  It seemed to increase in spiciness and a bit astringent on the tongue and back of the throat. Overall I wasn’t initially impressed served neat. 

I added a few drops of water to open the flavors which really made a difference to me. The initial bitter/sour flavors mellowed allowing the oak and char to come through more predominately. There was still a bit of burn in the throat, but much nicer than before. It finished with a pleasant smooth oak taste."
3.5,"N: Green apples, and bright tropical fruit like lychees and melon. Slightly nutty.

P: dry white wine, apricot, mineral, strawberry

F: clean, dry, gentle fruit

This is one of the staple entry level malts on my shelf, one of the better values you can buy and a good introduction to gentle sherried Highland malts."
