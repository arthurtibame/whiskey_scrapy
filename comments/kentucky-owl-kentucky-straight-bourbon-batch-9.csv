3.5,I received this as a two ounce sample.  Excellent nose leads to a disappointing heat that overpowers taste.   Can’t even identify flavors.  Not worth the price

4.25,"Wow!! Full of flavor. Considering the proof it was very smooth! Appearance dark amber. Smells of age but no burning on the nose. Complex taste with long lasting flavor. 
Is it worth the price? Only if you have an extra $300 to spend but it is very good!"

5.0,"Neat.  Neck pour.  Super rich.  Floral at first but transitions to a baking spice bomb.  Cinnamon.  Burnt caramel.  Nice cherry.  Burnt sugar and French vanilla.  It’s really nice.  Perfectly balanced.  None of the flavors are aggressive but they are distinct and rich.

Wow, it’s a roller coaster.  A long roller coaster.  I want to go for another sip but it’s still hitting me with flavors.  Alright, the texture is super oily, thick but smooth.  An overwhelming brown sugar and cherry sweetness is the first to strike.  Flips into a cinnamon bomb, mutes for a second and then brings caramel, char, vanilla in waves.  It finishes like a creme brûlée.  

Holy shit.  That is amazing.  That may be the best bourbon I have ever had.  Most expensive thing I have ever purchased but it is amazing.  

Flavor is still coming.  Wrote two paragraphs and the flavors are still coming in waves.  I’m shocked."
4.5,Wow! Yes it has heat but the flavor is tremendous! Sugar and honey wirh the heat. Nice burn all the way down.
4.75,This is one of the best bourbons I’ve ever had in my life. Smooth yet full of proof. Hefty price tag but actually worth it compared to others.
