4.5,"Aman’s Beer & Wine - Wisconsin

Light, caramel nose; sweet, nutty almost chocolates candy palate; earthy finish

Smooth all around, very complex and tasty. Can definitely feel the heat but not nearly is it extreme"
2.0,"This was selected by ABC and is barrel No. 1065. Lots of oak on the nose, some sweetness, but it's overpowered by ethanol. On first sip, corn immediately stands out, followed by oak and it's all quickly burned out with pure heat. Holding it in your mouth through the heat, you'll get some vanilla, and a slight touch of rye. The heat in the finish was shorter lived than expected, initially it gets oaky again. This  gives way to more caramel than I would have expected."
