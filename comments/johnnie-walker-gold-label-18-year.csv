3.0,81 - spicy after it leaves mouth for a while. Smooth though. Neat that I have a bottle that's been discontinued. Will need to drink it sparingly!  Wonder what the new Gold Reserve tastes like compared to this.

4.0,"I haven't been too keen on most of the blends I've tried, but this is a good whisky. It has a very pleasing aroma with toffee, vanilla and honey. The flavor is very well balanced and smooth with a light peat flavor and tobacco notes. It reminds me of a mix of my favorite Highland bottles, like The Balvenie and Macallan. I would ask for this one."

4.0,"With the 18 year Johnnie moves out of the lower levels and into the middle tier of Scotch. Nose is crisp and light with little peat. First sip is almond and light caramel. Burn is alcohol forward that fills the mouth at the end with a quick rise and slow fall. Definitely an improvement over the entry Walkers, but still below most Compass Box entries."
3.75,"Very nice, but a little thin. Short on the finish."
5.0,"This one is hard to find since Johnnie Walker stop making it some years ago. I just had the pleasure to taste it, because a friend gave birth to her newborn child and the husband was celebrating with this old bottle. 

first of all, it is superior to the actual line of Johnnie walker green label, gold label reserve and platinium label. it just is. 

i have never had a better 18 year old whisky, i dont know why i dislike whiskies of that particular age. Well, this is pretty good. 

On the nose you get Honey, orange and peat. very beautiful gentle aroma, sweet and delightful.

On the palate is sweet at first with honey notes, but then it turns salty and spicy, with a full oakyness flavor, with a touch of elegant peat. finish is long and made me remind of cough syrup like the one you drink when you are sick. beautiful enormous experience"
