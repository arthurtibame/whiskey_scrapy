1.0,"This is one of the worst whiskey's I've ever had the displeasure to try, second only to the American Malt released by the same distiller.

Nose: Wet grass, Light oak, Touch of vanilla
Palate: Weird char impact, more wet grass, and an almost tequila-like smoke quality
Finish: astringent, sharp, and thankfully quite short.

While we put the sample bottle we were sent to good use on unsuspecting coworkers, it was ultimately poured down the drain."
