3.0,"I’ve tasted the Hibiki 12 and 17 year older brothers of this whiskey, and their is a faint resemblance, just as milk reminds one of cream. The last time I purchased this Japanese Harmony version of Hibiki, the price had doubled from its previously well priced offering, making it an over priced version for its actual quality. I just got my hands on Hibiki 21 and this one has spent 21 years refining itself into something that halts time itself. It’s that stunning, but the un-aged varietal here is a faint shadow of the finished product."
