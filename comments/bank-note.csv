2.0,"I tried to like this, I really did, but there is too much immature alcohol burn on the palate. I even tried it on the rocks but didn't help much.  Better off with Ballantines or spend a little more for what I think is the best value in scotch, monkey shoulder."

4.0,"Nose is vanilla,  sugar,  caramel .   Taste is much the same,  vanilla,  brown sugar,  alcohol,  Surprisingly very good whiskey for the price.   Surprised is not rated higher."
3.0,"Very sweet.  Toffee and carmel.  A little flat and vanishing on the finish.  Nice, unassuming."

3.25,"Nice flavors and a creamy mouth feel. Too astringent to be a sipper, probably because of the young age. Better on the rocks. Likely a good mixer."
4.0,Orange citrus on the nose.

2.25,"This is a pretty nice blended scotch for the value. There’s quite a bit of bite on the nose, and on the tongue. I had this taste in a whiskey wedge glass to cut the burn with a little ice. There are some nice sweet flavors on the tongue, and not too long a finish. That helps to cut through the burn. It’s alright on its own, but I bet it would make an excellent mixer."

4.0,I had the peated reserve which has a wonderful smoky or earthy note.
2.75,"Fascinating sweet aroma. Very nice. Light flavor and body, but pleasant balance. Approachable and tastes just like a nice blended scotch."
2.75,"I purchased for $15 . What do you get for that investment....well you get a cork, a 5 year age statement, 86 proof and 40% malt/60% grain. You also get a decent scotch with actual flavor and great value. Poured neat, nose is light with fruit, honey, some malt and yeah the grain notes. Palate is nice blast of honey malt, golden apple with some slight bitter wood and more grain sneaking in. The mouthfeel is soft and pretty good for this price range. Finish is fairly quick with a fade of the fruity malt and drying wood. Minor grain overtones. Couple drops of water really enhances the palate and adds some creaminess. Overall this is damn good for 15 bucks and I don't worry at all that Im plowing through the bottle. Have to say I will buy this again to extend the life of my pricier stock. No world beater and sure the grain is present but this is better than most bottom shelfers Ive had.......78/100.....That being said Speyburn Bradan Orach is a little more $ but a fantastic single malt value"
4.0,You really can’t go wrong here - For the money this is all around smooth with decent taste all around and treats you right

4.0,Very good average blended scotch.
5.0,"Nose- butter, cream, apples 

Taste- honey, vanilla, cinnamon, apple pie

Finish- short and clean"
3.0,"For the price, it’s hard to find a better cocktail scotch. No complexity or character, but it more than adequately stands up in a well made drink."
4.0,"vanilla spice, a little hot"

4.0,"Thin, watery legs after a swirl. Carmel and vanilla on the nose with hints of fruit and Carmel. Lots of grains on the initial sip with clover sweetness and roasted nut flavor. Lingering finish with a pleasant heat to finish up with more grain, casual peat smoke and an almost tobacco lingering on the pallet. Overall, the best whisky for the price that I have ever tasted. I was skeptical but it really has become a great option for an everyday kind of scotch."
2.0,This is good decent and cheap.
2.0,"Tried this twice. First time was the last shot on a bottle sitting on the 12th shelf of my local bar. It was so light, I thought it was water with some peat flavor added. After I confirmed this with the bartender, we figured that the bottle was mishandled in some way. It could have been sitting up there for several years (the bar has over 1100 bottles) so who knows what might have happened to it? So this week the same bar got a brand new bottle, and the same bartender offered up a taste. Still very, very light. No backbone. No balls. Not quite smoky water again, but still not satisfying. Use it as a mixer for your friends who hate whiskey, otherwise pick something else up."
