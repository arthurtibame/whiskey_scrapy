3.75,"The nose is rich, smoky, meaty, and salty (much like Lagavulin 16) with some fresh orange and peat notes. The palate has a lot of smoke and peat with lots of mushrooms. It isn't overly harsh, but that iodine sure does last. It has some sweetness that is a little like toffee with some walnuts, but that is hard to make out. The peat outweighs the smoke, which I'm not a huge fan of. There are some nice notes of slightly creamy dark chocolate, but there are also some random herbal notes that are difficult to make out. The flavor is rich and doesn't have much on the sweet end of the spectrum. There's a bit of brine and salt, but it isn't excessive. There's some nice smoky meatiness like one would find in chipotles. With added water, it becomes less harsh, but the peat really comes out, giving it sort of a minty flavor. The richness is enhanced by additional chocolate and creaminess, but it winds up tasting a lot like Laphroaig with herbal bandages coming through. I'd say that the balance is better than in Laphroaig with the creamy chocolate and other bits of subtle flavor such as mineral and mild floral notes coming out, it's still not exceptional."

4.5,"Omg...almost have to chew, it's so thick.
First Octomore, definitely not the last. 

Nose is less smoky than expected. Sweet, vanilla, maybe some cheese. Salty smoke in the background.

Very thick mouthfeel. Vanilla, smokiness, warming. Gentle smoke, but very present. Not medicinal, more of a salty, savoury smokiness.

Long, warm finish. Smoke lingers.

The smokiness is not smack-in-the-face. It sort of coats the whisky. Sweetness and smoke are fighting for the attention."

4.5,Strong peat on the nose and palate but remarkably well balanced within the whisky.
4.25,"After 544 whiskies (not in one night lol) i finally had the ""super peated"", incredibly famous Octomore. I know there are a lot of Octomore expressions but i managed to get me a sample of the 08.1. 

Octomore as you might already know, is the heavily peated whisky from bruichladdich distillery, which is known for its organic barley. It is called ""masterclass"" and it has 167ppm of Peat, which is like 5 times an Ardbeg. Unchill filthered and uncolored. 

But, was it any good?

Bottled at 59.3%abv, amber color. 

On the nose: SUPER PERFUMED. It is quite lovely and easy on the nose. The peat presents itself very strong but perfumed. Like cologne infused foam. Not smoky or earthy at all, but perfumed. Then, clean citric notes appear: fresh limes and oranges. After a couple of minutes that fresh orange turns into a more artificial / sugary orange. After a couple of sips, lemon air freshener and thick caramel notes appear. 

On the palate: it is very straightforward, only four flavors: lemon, lime, oranges (all of them very fresh and clean) and pepper. 

Then.... kaboom.

Aftertaste is way too powerful. It feels like it can cure you from any disease because no bacteria or virus can survive a sulphuric bath like the one you just inflicted to your esophagus. Very earthy dry, smoky, sulphuric and full of mint, this one i will remember for ages. 

I have had whiskies with higher abv and none of them deliver this black mint, super listerine, smoky sensation. It is not unpleasant but not amazing either. 

Overall this dram has a very good nose and not a very complex palate. Aftertaste is way too powerful and i get it, you wanted to make world's peatiest dram and you went for it, that doesn't necessarily means its going to be great. It is not what i expected, it is not bad but not that enjoyable. 84 over 100 is my score for it."

4.75,"Rich to the extreme, pungent, peaty, smoky, spicy, this is not a whisky but an experience. Superb."
4.25,"Waipu Pizza Barn (NZ) was good enough to have one of these (sold out) bottles in the bar which I couldn’t say no to, and man it was great.  I really think Smokey peaty drams are growing on me.

This one instantly takes me to a smouldering camp fire, with hints of caramel and coconut toasted marshmallows.  Tasting it initially is sweet and soft on the tongue - a real pleasure, then it opens up to a salty and very Smokey flavour.  Like the whiskey was soaked in last nights fireplace coals!  A long and peppery finish, and after trying both neat and with a couple of drops of water - the water was the preferred option for the finish.  

There were only 42,000 bottles available, and you can’t get them from the source anymore - so if you find it, best try it!"

5.0,"A brace of Octomores — 8.1 and 8.3 — to wrap up my unreliable tasting notes from the recent WhiskyLive event in New York. Both were smoky, of course, but also deliciously sweet in a rich, mouth-coating way. Neither the smoke nor the proof made these challenging to drink: the explosion of jammy flavors was too delicious to resist. I marked these both down as five stars as I drank them, and even though I wonder whether my generous ratings for the night were driven more by my intoxicated euphoria than my critical faculties I do think they are both outstanding. The 8.1 had the slight edge, with the bourbon wood providing a more balanced finish than the sweeter barrels of the 8.3."

4.25,"Very nice but not particularly peatier than, say, Laphroaig Cask Strength. 93"
4.5,"Un nez qui te déchire les naseaux, très très tourbé et vert.
L'attaque n'est pas aussi brutale et la tourbe est agréable, chaleureuse, assez ronde finalement.
Par contre, on avale une énorme bouffée de fumée qui fait sursauter. C'est quand même très agréable et surtout la finale que j'adore, excessivement longue. On sent peu de choses hormis la tourbe et la fumée, mais peut-être comme des fruits rouges."

4.5,"On the nose is thick smoke, rich dark caramel, milk chocolate, candied orange peel, vanilla cake and fresh baked lemon tarts.
-
To the palate it is rich, velvety and warming with flavours of soft fruit, billowing smoke, sea breeze, sweet oak, vanilla fudge, marzipan with a hint of honey dew melon, floral barley and licorice.
-
In the finish it’s has a dry, slightly medicinal, smoky peat lingering long with oak and sweet mint with a hint of green moss.
—
With water added, the nose becomes a touch lighter with sponge toffee notes.  More intense on the palate with salted licorice and sweet oak sugar.  The finish becomes numbing with a coating of smoke and a slight medicinal note.

4.25,"Serious peat, high ABV! Vanilla, fruit undertones. Delicious but not for the feint of heart."
5.0,Wow. The Holy Grail. Smokey and peaty from nose to finish. Palate slightly vanilla with mild hints of fruits. Finish was like somebody turned up the peat volume - wowsers. Long finish and a heartwarmer.

4.75,"Deep peat smell, with a sweet undertone. Incredibly strong peat flavor with a sugar cane sweetness underneath, flavor matches the aroma almost perfectly. What I love is the strength. Super powerful aggressive flavors that hit you like a truck. There's a super long smoky tail with Rich spice. A touch behind the ardbeg Corryvrecken for me but damned close."

3.0,"Octomore will always be a nice dram to finish a dram session, and I don’t think that will ever change.  What has changed is whether or not the price is worth it.  I recently had the privilege of trying Octomore 2.1, and that instantly became my favorite Octomore.  This Octomore 8.1, with 3 additional years of aging, cannot compare.

Octomore 8.1 is 8 years old, and previous x.1 Octomore offerings are 5 years old.  I have had the 7.1, 6.1, 5.1, 4.1, and 2.1.  This 8.1 tastes younger.  Without water, it is just wound up and tense.  It needs a massage.  Flavors are strong, and most of them are weird.  Sewage.  And I don’t know if it’s a “pleasant sewage.”  Of course, tons and tons of ash.  The rich buttery counterbalance of previous Octomores is missing.

With water, this one is much better.  The flavors are milder and quite pleasant.  Vinegar, tart, raw fish, caviar, loads of salt, and a satisfying heap of peat.  But the butter is missing.

I have not tried the 9 or 10 series of Octomore, but I will, because I am still a believer.  But my expectations are lowered after having had 8.1 and 8.3.

Score: 0 (forgettable) 
How much does a bottle cost: $170-200 
How much do I think a bottle is worth: $120"

4.25,"Nosing. Very sweet aroma, honey and oats, and oak in the first whiff. For the second whiff, you get hit more with a very slight burn from the intensity of high alcohol and burnt rubber tires. 

Flavour. High ABV but it doesn’t have the peppery burn that you get like from all other relatively young whisky. What you find is a soothing warmness that spreads across your mouth - a sensation I’ve not felt with other whisky before. Once the first wave of warmness boils over, you get strong Saltiness, briny and iodine, and a smooth creamy texture 

Finish - Smokey, definitely but calling this peatiness will not do this justice. Give it 10 seconds and you are licking the bottom of a bbq beef shank cauldron. Don’t feel so? Force a belch - and you will be surprise at the aroma that erupts from within you. Weird - but true"
