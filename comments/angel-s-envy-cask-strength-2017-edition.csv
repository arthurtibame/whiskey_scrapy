3.0,"$169.99 @ BevMo. 
To be totally honest, this Bourbon was a huge disappointment. It's very very spicy, to the point that it's hard to get much else out of it. It's also very hot for this proof. For example, the Elijah Craig Barrel Proof or Booker's of equal proof are both much smoother. There is a nice long finish where you finally get some red fruits and brown sugar. I will give it another month to oxidise and post an update. I hope it improves
Update: After letting it rest for 2 months I came back to it and the oxidation has really improved it. Spice has receeded and now more of the sweeter notes are evident. Still 3 stars considering the price but I am at least beginning to enjoy it."

4.0,"Note that I was poured the last remaining ounces in the bottle, so I think this had the advantage of air time. The color is striking, a rich, deep amber that evidences its port cask finish. Roasted caramel, char, and fresh oak on the nose. Not as much alcohol sting on the nose as I expected. The palate follows suit, it seems smooth for its proof. Nice sweetness, which is expected for Angel's Envy juice. There's a pleasant perfume note, which I usually don't like, but here it works. Balanced with just the right amount of baking spice, and this spice lingers on the back of the tongue throughout. It finishes with heat and cacao nibs. Not the most complex pour, but that's a minor quibble. This has something for the adventurous novice looking to expand his palate, and something for a veteran. It would probably work as an aperitif, as dessert, as a nightcap, or on it's own, it even holds up to a cigar. 4 stars, with the potential for 5. At its price point it's hard to make this an every day pour, but you may be tempted. 4/23/18"

2.5,Sweeter notes on the nose. It’s almost deceiving on the pallet. Can definitely taste the spiciness from the barrels. The finish dissolves from your pallet fairly quickly.
4.25,"The nose is spicy of black pepper and dominated by oak and port with hints of toffee and cinnamon. The palate is dry and full of rye spiciness with dry port sweetness coming through, with cinnamon, vanilla and toffee in the background. The finish is medium and mouth warming with rye and cinnamon that fades and gives way to faint vanilla and toffee."
