4.0,"I bought this because of distillers rating and I wanted to be disappointed because of the whole ""organic"" label even though it's really young, over hyped perhaps/trendy?  I have not had the benromach 10 year, so I cannot compare.  This is a really tasty dram. Very well made and I have no complaints, it exceeded expectations.  I would buy it again down the road. Worth a try.  Smooth, vanilla, caramel, smooth."

null,"This is much more than their standard 10 yr old , I guess from paying the extra admin costs  to get the organic certificate.  Is the taste that much significantly better because it's organic?"

5.0,"Oaky typical Speyside (which is a good thing) with a creamy finish. One heck of a whisky. Could drink it all night, but I won't. I wanna save it for later."
4.0,"A PHENOMENAL whisky, well-balanced with a spicy yet smooth finish. The nose underperforms just a tad, but the palate has a nice mouthfeel, with American oak getting the breakout role. Truly well crafted."

4.5,"Went exploring to specifically seek out this bottle as it is one of the few Scotch offerings with organic barley. Benromach does not identify the farms where the barley is grown but they do indicate that every step of the process is certified by the UK Soil Association.

Not surprising that this whisky showcases the quality of the barley throughout. Fresh spring cereal with a hint of oak & vanilla on the nose. The cereal notes are even more prominent on the palate and mesh nicely with the peppery spice of the virgin oak. Super clean and vibrant - quite enjoyable. A sliver of water is key to coax out the best characteristics of the barley. This whisky is young but the quality is definitely apparent even if it never really ‘wowed’. As I worked through the bottle, the grin on my face got bigger each time I reached for this.

Rating: The Distiller score is through the stratosphere and probably 5 points too high. 90 for me. Would I buy again? Sure at some point, but I’m not rushing out to replenish the bottle. At $72, this plays in a very competitive arena.

3.0,"Scott_E is on the money with this one. Tropical, light and sweet. This was a newly opened bottle and had the unfortunate timing of being tried with a 97 glenthroes and Van winkle 12 so sadly very much 3rd place. Solid 3."

1.75,"95?  Here is a classic case of “organic” being mixed up with being better or, in this case, even good.  

This was tested blind (my preferred method) beside Millstone 100 and Oban 14.  To say this was the ugly duckling is an understatement. 

Benromach Organic notes - citrus, sour, an earth smell similar to tulip bulbs or iris roots.  Palate felt hot but light and young.  Sour is again in the notes on the finish. 

I had no clue on what it was, I knew it wasn’t bourbon or Canadian as it wasn’t sweet in any way but I couldn’t even guess what Scotch it might be. 

This one is all marketing and I encourage you to pass."

4.0,"Being the first whisky to be certified 'Organic' by UK Soil Association standards, this Single Malt is a bit of a trend-setter. Maturation in American virgin oak casks gives this Benromach a surprising depth and complexity, which is rarely found at this young age. On the nose, I get banana, apricots and toffee with lemongrass, marshmallows and hints of fresh mint. All very sweet and spicy. Tropical fruits, green tea and even a touch of chili follow on the palate before the lingering, cask-dominated and mildly dry finish kicks in. This dram is refreshingly different!

RATING: 3.9/5.0 stars ≙ 86 pts → FIRST-CLASS [-]"

3.5,"*My bottle: Distilled 2010, bottled 2017.

Nose: Malted barley, butterscotch, vanilla, leather, some very fine fresh oak and a touch of tobacco. There's a heathery note as well. A very crisp nose.

Palate: Dry and bittersweet arrival, intensely cereal and malty - like munching down on a handful of freshly milled grist. A light cereal sweetness, and adding water brings out more sweetness and a spiciness from the grain that is otherwise completely hidden. Such an unrelentingly cereal palate!

Finish: Short. Soft, clean, and ... hey, where did it go?

This has a clearer and more cereal nose than any other Benromach I've tasted, and with a drop of water it blooms and promises a refreshing and crisp palate. That it certainly is, but there is also delicacy to the point of shyness. Some light aromas and flavours flash about but there is an overall lack of character.

Maybe it's too refined for a rough old codger with taste buds burnt out after years of whisky drinking?

There's certainly nothing unpleasant about it, and it does have a kind of austere sophistication. The nose is very nice, the palate crisp and dry and the finish sweet, simple and short.  It's the whisky equivalent of a dry white wine that is so icy clean it almost tastes like water.

Unfortunately I like my whiskies with a bit more personality, even if they are sometimes uncouth and not fit for genteel company. (I am led to believe that the 2010 batch is different in profile to the earlier expressions).

In the final analysis this strikes me as being like a refined Glenmorangie Original or Glenfiddich 12. Well made, clean, poised, but best used as a safe everyday tipple or the first baseline malt of a tasting session. I cannot begin to comprehend the official score of 95 given to this when the 15 Year Old and Peated expressions are so clearly superior.

I wish I could give this more, because sitting here with the very pleasant light aftertaste it leaves I have a positive impression, and I can imagine many whisky drinkers would appreciate its qualities more than I, however in the end, I'm just not that impressed.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"

5.0,"This will always be a five for me. Maybe it’s not perfect, but it has too many of my favorite memories connected with it. 

Sweet on the nose: caramelized sugar, chocolate, honey, and some weird creamed corn thing (there’s a first time for everything)

Taste is the bomb. Sweet, soft (is that a thing??), there’s the sugar again, and a finish of hot chocolate powder. 

Divine."

2.75,"Lacks the finesse, the taste is full, yet too harsh. Rather pleasant on the nose though."
3.5,"This is called a NAS whisky but the packaging has distillation and bottling years, I can presume that mine is a 5 year old expression. I've seen 7 year bottles in bars though.

This smells its age. Very grassy and green, lemon, ginger, followed by an earthy/spicy quality like cedar. None of the rounded, cakey qualities of older expressions.

Dry entry, black pepper, lemon zest, mineral water, green apples. Finish is clean, herbal, savory.

This is an interesting example of unique qualities that young whisky has. Very bright, astringent, but in an appealing way."

3.75,"A beautiful color ,a clear gold liquid. Open on the nose, wood from new oak is easy to find, a hint of vanilla and a lil bit of sugar. On the palate it confirms everything the nose had, a hint of coffee in the background, oily and a little peppery ,the finish is not that long but pleasant. 
Nice bottle . Not the best but , super nice."

3.25,"Please note, this review referis to the very first edition of the bottling, the 2006.
The color is dark amber, very strong, amazing considering is without artigicial colouring.
The scent is very sweet, almost cloying (at times reminiscent of a Bourbon), even to let it breathe does not give a step: vanilla in profusion, caramel, a pinch of citrus. Wood is also very present (a bit like smelling the beads of a newly renovated mountain hut): the aging is unknown (it is said between 5 and 6 years) but the youthfulness of both whisky and wood is well present . In the long run, there is also some banana.
The scent of wood remains strong on the palate, like drinking an extract of shavings, softened on the sweet (almost biscuity) and fruity side. Not very incisive and a little boring, without any particular flicker.
The finish remains sweet with a hint of bitterness, not very long."
