3.75,"Noses very light, corn, malty. Hits the palate smooth, like a scotch in terms of profile, which is very much pears, honey, citrus zest, and a very slight alcohol burn that combines with sweetness at the end. A very good dram!"
3.0,"Whiskey with a rhum finish. Interesting because it really gives notes of it to the aroma and taste.

3.5,It has a high spice for spice sake. Nice but not overwhelming. There are better options.
3.0,It’s ok but expected much more based on other ratings.  Powers gold tastes better.

3.25,"I’m not a big connossiour of Irish whisky and have been underwhelmed by Teeling’s distillate at festivals but a recent opportunity to taste some of their vintage sourced whiskies alongside their core range was too good to pass up. First up was their small batch ex-rum cask whisky, which comprises 25% malted whisky and 75% grain, aged for four to seven years. 

The nose is like a banana creme brulee, which is always a good thing in my books. There are more bananas and cream on the palate along with tinned fruit, tangerines, weak tea and a light spice. The finish is lightly sweet with a hint of spice. A decent drop but not one that’s going to change my drinking habits."

4.0,"Light nose, refreshing, but much heavier on the pallet than single grain. Complex flavors, pretty long finish"
4.25,"Nose - apple, cream and chocolate, some sharp grain notes and a bit of spice, also hints of dried dark fruit 
Taste - apple and creamy sweetness are dominant, some vanilla and barrel spice, hints of chocolate and grassy notes
Finish - sweet and spices mix and linger, a slight heat, a bit of dryness on the tip of your tongue"

3.0,Very standard Irish whiskey with all the hallmarks (thin and twangy). A slight cane sugar note elevates it above mediocrity.

3.75,"Easy to sip. It is too easy to drink that you don’t realize that you’ve already had 2 or 3 glasses. Sweet and buttery in touch, but without lingering aftertaste of sugary sweetness. Good $30 bottle"
3.5,"I’m not a big fan of Irish whiskies, but this was pretty good. The rum finish helps smooth out the rough edges of the whiskey. I felt the same way about the original Glenmorangie 10, not the biggest fan of their standard bottling, but when trying their cask finished bottlings they really helped with the overall flavor."

3.0,"What Goose Island or Anchor Brewing are to the world of beer.. Teeling is that of Irish Whiskey. These brothers are craft. And good at it! When sampling, keep CRAFT in your mind. All positive reviews are spot on with nose + taste. Finding the mood to drink this particular gem, lies somewhere between hot summer nights and sunsets at dinner. What you love about Rum is what you'll love about this whiskey.. well done Teeling's! 👌🏼"

3.0,"On the nose, sweet grain, honeyed oat and sugar cane. On the palate, toasted oatmeal and caramelized sugar with a hint of pear. A slight kick and second helping of sweetness on the finish. Silky texture and and more depth than you’ll find in most Irish Whiskey’s."
3.5,"Vanilla, cinnamon nose; peppery, mild fruity, late burn, skips middle of the tongue, acidic"
