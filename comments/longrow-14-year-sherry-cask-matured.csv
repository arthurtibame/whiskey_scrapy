4.0,"Got a bottle for only $65 due to store’s mistake.

Neat, no water

Nose: heavy peat and smoke but not overwhelming, there’s charred oak, honey, raisin, slight sulphur.
Palate: starts with that oily honey sweetness, a little waxy and tad salty, then the signature campbeltown funk follows. it’s hot, the high abv is obvious.
Finish: hmmm Long finish with earthy smoke and trace of sweetness linger for a long time, the heat remains but slowly warm down.

For $65, I should’ve bought another, this is delicious!"

4.5,"Sweet nose. Sweet, dark fruit, followed by damp wood, fire, iodine, chemical, salt, brine and, of course, peat. Long and spiky finish. Excellent substitute (maybe better) for Springbank 13 (2003, cask strength). Great value."
4.5,"cask strength ABV, smoky nose and caramel finish"

3.25,nice & funky as usual.
2.75,"Longrow 14 year Sherry Cask - 57.8%

if that doesn't sound like heaven, I'm not sure what does.  

Amber color, slow forming legs, very much what you'd expect.  I however don't believe this is a first fill sherry cask (bottle confirms, refilled).  That said it has a nice color, these aren't overly used casks for sure.  

The nose gives off that springbank funk, peat, meaty salty savory, then finishes with dark fruits raisins, plums, a touch of chocolate powder, and a touch of sour notes from the sherry.  A touch of water brings out more of a candy fruit note and pushes the funk and salt notes back a bit.  

That sour sherry note really comes out in the opening, followed by bitterness, funk, salt, and springbank's barely notes.  I get hints of soy sauce as well.  Water is bringing out some vanilla but the fruity soy sauce and now that springbank BBQ is coming through.  

Not much of a finish.  Just somewhat fades from the super powerful opening.  Leaves a bit of vanilla and oak on the back end.  

so let me walk through my rating here.  A 3.0 is a whisky that you buy if it is to your profile and it is in your price range.  Anything above you start to step out of your standard choices or you go a bit over your conformable spending zone.  Below that and you start need a sale or perhaps you just pass on it all together.  This is the saltiest springbank product I have had to date, it's dry and not overly sweat, and while it gives me all the notes I like in a longrow they're not shining through.  As a result it's just a touch below a 3.  I however think anyone who's a huge fan of these will still want to get this one."

3.0,"This taught me that I don’t think I love sherry finishes. Very sweet. Tastes of Carmel. Not my favorite, but I can definitely respect it."
4.0,"fruity, salty slightly medicinal"
3.75,"Ah yes usually Monday night is not a drinking one but hey down in ChCh for work, return flight delayed and trying to catch up with everyone for xmas so good a time as any to get stuck into 6 drams with a mate. Number 4 on the list was the cask strength Longrow 14 yr Sherry wood. I did enjoy this one, maybe 2nd or 3rd on the night. Springbank 15yr was the clear winner by a mile however. This I'd say a 3.75. Given it was 57.8% I had to add a few drops in and it opened up nicely. On the thinner side after the SB 15 but still lovely. Smokey, light sulphur, sherry, and red berrys. Nice but like most Longrows wouldn't run out to grab a bottle."
