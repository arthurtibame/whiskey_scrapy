5.0,I am a neat whiskey guy and this one just blew me away. I was having Italian food and strong flavor and aroma of it paired well with lighter Italian flavors. Amazing whiskey.
5.0,"I really enjoyed St George Baller because it's so unique, in a good way. The plum wine cask gives it a very distinct sweet and sour finish that could be polarizing but it worked for me. I've tried a lot of whisky and a lot of them blend together in my memory but there's nothing that compares to the distinct flavor of this one. If you see it at a bar definitely try it. I would not pay a ridiculous marked up price for a bottle but I will try to get a bottle of this year's release."

4.0,"I was in Phoenix this past week, and was astonished to see this on the shelf at the hotel bar.  Unopened and just sitting there.  At $15 /Dram , I gave it a go.  It's light and floral, well balanced...almost a cross between an elegant Speysider and Hibiki 17.  I think it's a west coast only item, but if you're a fan of Hibiki 12 or 17, this is a worthwhile taste.  Not sure I'd buy a bottle (I checked online...quite expensive), but I'm glad I tried a small amount."

4.0,"I really like this expression, it is so different from any single malt or american whiskey I have tasted. It is definitely interesting, fairly light and delicate and probably more similar to Japanese expressions. The floral notes really grab you on the nose, ranging from sherry to more tropical notes."

2.0,"This doesn't smell like whisky, the plum wine  influence is immediately obvious. That fruity sweet note is mixed with peat. So this smells like... hospital bathroom soap. Viscous on the tongue, this is thick. Perhaps the thickest whisky I've ever had. The sweet note hits up front, but the fruity hospital note dominates. That being said, I'm trying hard to hate it, but I don't. I probably won't drink it again, but it's interesting and not off putting, even for someone like me who dislikes, or at best  barely tolerates, peat. Definitely unique. Some people are going to love this. 6/27/18"
4.0,"I've been sitting on this bottle for a year, cognizant of its scarcity value, but the combination of a wider release this year and a warm evening  that called out for something lighter finally nudged me to pop its cork. I'm a fool for delaying. I was immediately rewarded with one of my favorite flavor profiles, a tropical fruit nose of pineapple, along with pine and lemongrass. And oh my lord the taste: this is beautiful and unique. There are apples and pears and malt, to be sure, but what stands out is the backdrop of aniseed. It’s subtle but distinct, not overpowering in a Pernod or absinthe way, but unmistakable nonetheless. I don’t think I’ve come across this flavor in a whisky before. You get so used to parsing the minor differences between the typical reference points that it’s incredibly exciting to encounter something so different. It’s the imprint of the plum liqueur cask finish, no doubt, and you can smell its provenance most significantly in the empty glass. As the aniseed tapers, there’s a long finish that fades to a zesty blast of cinnamon. I’m not sure how frequently I’ll return to this bottle, but the world seems a little better for its audacity. Amid a sea of expensive and indistinctive craft whisky, Baller has balls."
5.0,Sweet floral nose and palette...The plum cask finish definitely gives it the uniqueness...excellent!

5.0,"smells a little malty, like an unassuming scotch or Japanese whiskey. one taste and it starts off light then you get hit with a ton of flavor. bacon, heat from alcohol, some sort of sea and vegetal flavor (brine / peat / moss / grass?), some chocolatey malt. a lot wrapped up in here. finish has heat for a long time and a light malty flavor lingers."

5.0,"An incredible gift from my dad who lives in California. Smokey, powerful, and like nothing I've ever had before. Gets better each sip and opens up with a bit of water - can be a bit overwhelming at first. Plum barrel aging gives it an incredible sweet and sour finish. Still prefer the standard Lots from SG"

1.0,"I drank it neat. Not good. Not complex. Just plain and harsh taste. I Don’t recommend neat, maybe with cola or something but at a high price point, I don’t want to add cola"
4.0,"Musty grapes. Musty smokiness. Musty figs. Musty floral celery. Musty and pleasant.

Paired perfectly with pickled veggies and fruit."

0.25,"Being a long-time lover of single malts and an American, I bought this really hoping I would like it. Brought it to a bottle-share tasting event with a couple of friends and on first sip we all individually decided it was without a doubt the worst malt whisky we have ever tried, and possibly the worst liquor of any category. After sipping some other whiskies I came back to it, thinking, ""It couldn't have been THAT bad."" - but it was. May use this as drain cleaner, but will certainly not be letting it touch my lips again. Buy this only if you want to see how bad a single malt can possibly be."

3.25,"• Nose - soapy floral younger whiskey. Buttery? Vegetal funk? Spice. 
• Taste - smokey, some light ashy bitterness. Vegetal on the aftertaste. The sweetness is almost what's wrong with it. Started as a good wood fired veggie pizza taste but the sweetness is like you stewed the tomatoes and basil for too long"

2.25,"This one is super weird.  I feel like I maybe didn't like it but it was so confusing I just don't know.  My thought is that I need to give this another shot in a highball with soda water.  To be clear: I'm not a whiskey cocktail guy but this seems like it might make a good whiskey cocktail.

Nose: 100% lychee but without the sweetness from lychee.  Background smoke, vanilla, and some light herbaceous notes.

Flavor:  Floral but with heavy overtones of ashtray and expensive soap.

Finish: Super short with more smokey ashtray flavors and a little bit of sweetness."

5.0,"An adventure for the senses.  Extremely unique; it is certainly unlike anything else (for better or for worse).  On the nose, plum, spice, and soap. The palate is complex, starting with sweetness and plum then moving to soap, smoke, and spice and finishing with a bit of pear, ash, and peat.  I expect this to be ""hate it or love it,"" in my case I'm wishing I picked up a second bottle!"

Flowers and lychees on the nose.
Earthy, woody shiitake mushroom palate with a soft, creamy mouthfeel and very light sweetness.
Nice, light burn with a medium finish.
This is an elegant, unique pour that would be a fantastic addition to any collection."

4.25,"Amazing nose! Notes if very fine sake, floral, cantaloupe , crisp white wine. Taste is very close to the nose except there is a tiny bit of bitter tail. Totally worth the money if you can find a bottle."
3.0,"There’s no two ways about it - if you’ve seen, smelled, or tasted St. George Baller Single Malt Whisky, you know you are beholding something unique and funky. Whether it’s funky in a good or bad way is completely up to you. I’ll refer you to @dubz480 ‘s review for details on this whisky’s production. 

This elusive bottle can be very hard to track down. It can also be very hard to find a pour. When I finally came across a bottle of this at a bar with it tucked up on the top shelf between Michter’s 10 Year Old Bourbon and Clase Azul Reposado Tequila, I was excited and then terrified at how much it would set me back. When barman informs me it’s $19 a pour, I’m almost relieved. It’s pricey but doable and I don’t have to gamble on a bottle. Thankfully he also gave me a very generous pour for that $19. Let’s get into those notes (with the caveat that it’s a public tasting). 

Nose: Sweet and tangy dark fruits, intense lychee, rice, and strong smoke notes. The smoke is more like fireplace than campfire or barbecue. 

Palate: Light bodied and crisp, with loads of flavors and textures going on but at their heart, they are youthful. Sweet and smokey hits first, then the acidity of the wine comes into play with some brine.  Notes of lychee, overripe black plums and persimmons dominate the fruit, and the smoke from the nose becomes ash. There’s not much in the way of medicinally smokey notes, it’s just ashy. The rice paper/rice tea flavor is prominent enough to make you think there was rice in the mash bill. 

Finish: Pretty short, and dominated by ash and overripe fruity sweetness. 

Impressions: It’s definitely unique. The youth hurts this one a little bit for me, because while the variety of casks and finishes have done a lot to cover that youth up, it still comes through as a ricey graininess covered up with smoke and wine. It’s a bit discordant to me, but it’s almost there as far as quality product goes. Also of note, this dram strikes me a bit like cotton candy does - not in flavor or sweetness - but because both are unique, there’s nothing else really out there to compare them too, and after a taste or two - I’m good, I don’t really need any more. All of this is likely why it’s recommended to try this in a highball (hence the “Baller” namesake), but the asking prices make it seem crazy to use this as a mixer.

3.0 ~ Average*

*Yes, I’m completely aware of the irony in rating this “average” considering there is nothing middle of the road about this dram. But 3.0 seems about right considering other drams I’ve given the same rating based on my overall impressions. Your mileage will likely vary..."
3.5,Atypical...
3.5,"Tonight's dram is one of the most polarizing American Craft Whiskeys out there! The St George Baller is distilled, aged and bottled by St George Spirits out of Alameda CA. Here is a summary of the Whiskey:

100% American barley (mostly two-row pale malted barley, rest lightly roasted)

Aged 3-4 years in used bourbon casks and French oak wine casks before finished in casks that held umeshu (Japanese style of plum liqueur) that is also made by St. George

Filtered through maple charcoal

Let's dive into the tasting:

On the palette it's got a nice mouthfeel with dark plums and slight smoke leading the way. Some brine, seaweed and smoked meats. The finish adds some honey, apples and black tea. To quote one of my wife's favorite songs, it's a beautiful disaster!!

It's definitely one of the most unique Whiskeys out there and one I enjoy! It's not for everyone but for those adventurous souls give it a try! 

Cheers All!"

0.75,"I was really excited about this one having heard many good things. 

The nose on the Baller is extremely unique. There are surprising notes of lychee, black tea, very light vanilla, and a background note of fireplace ash. The palate is where this whiskey really takes a hard left turn. The lychee notes on the nose come through again, but are quickly overwhelmed by a strange savory note landing somewhere between that savory Japanese rice tea, dried seaweed, and stale Bud Light. The ashy notes are rather dominant here as well. Rather than the rich smoky notes of a nice Islay scotch, the ashy palate comes across like an old ash tray, again with those strange stale beer notes. Like the smell of a slightly sketchy night club right around closing time. The finish is straight seaweed and cigar ash. I love a good savory, smoky whiskey but the Baller, while interesting, does not agree with my palate in any way shape or form. Definitely try this before you buy it."

4.5,"Neat.  First taste of this.  Plums hum from the glass immediately.  Dark fruits dominate and the wine influence comes out more and more. 

Oh that is interesting.  I’ve never had anything quite like this.  Plum wine comes to mind especially due to that sweetness.  Vanilla and smoke hidden beneath the fruit.  

I’ve been dedicated to bourbon for some time so this is me spreading my wings a bit in a different category.  I like this a lot.  Completely different spectrum of flavors than I am used to, but still inviting and delicious.  A refreshing, fruity treat that would go well around a fall campfire."

5.0,"This is such a unique and exciting whiskey, traditionalists beware. Smells of candied plums and summer campfire with that classic single malt smell. Taste initially is a soapy floral and plum flavor, silky like a scotch. Toasted nuts and the smoke come through at the end and linger for quite a while. Anyone who wants to try something new and exciting pick this up."
0.25,"A generous taste courtesy of Pie Chef Guy.

This is an odd one. The nose is surprisingly fruity and perfumy. There is a strange, almost medicinal smell kind of like a fresh band aid.

The taste is not any better. It's like a spiced ace bandage dipped in rubbing alcohol and cherry medicine. Me thinks not."
