4.0,"[4.7.2016] Found some leftover pumpernickel at North High Brewing while I worked on dissertation edits. This stuff sold out rapidly post-release but probably wasn't everything I dreamed it would be. Taste of roasted brown grains, rich pepper that is mellowed. Golden, almost malty with sweet barrel oils. After spice is dark and intense, but never quite find the tang common in a pumpernickel loaf. Good whiskey but will be better.

[6.26.2017] A follow-up to my previous note. The second batch was considerably better, even the castaways I helped clean up. There is, however, a limit to the number of glasses of this you should have at once unless you want to sleep in your yard that night..."

3.0,"Smooth up front, soft smell, little bite at the end.  The smell (pumpernickel?) is weird sometimes.  Very smooth and easy to drink but lacks a certain bite I get out of the others."
4.25,A spicy rye nose with hints of dark fruit.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy as the dark fruit lingers on the tongue. This is a unique flavor that is one of my favorite sippers.
3.75,"The nose is very pleasant with rye, oak, caramel and vanilla. The rye intensifies on the palate but is balanced by oak, vanilla ice cream and caramel, for a somewhat rich and oily experience. The finish is medium with lingering rye and oak, while vanilla and caramel fade behind it."
3.75,"I bought this bottle back in January and am just now getting around to reviewing it.  This is a local craft distillery out of Columbus Ohio. Found this bottle in my local Kroger for $45. It’s touted as “America’s first dark pumpernickel rye”. It’s aged “at least three years” in new American oak barrels. Not sure of the mashbill but it’s definitely very high rye content, offhand I’d say 90% or more. It’s bottled at a healthy 48% ABV. 

In the glass it’s a nice dark amber. It coats the glass with a decent oily coating and produces adequate legs. 

The nose is classic rye in spades! Tons of spicy cinnamon, pepper, cloves, hints of mint, maybe dill? Very nice. The palate is a little tamer - dry and spicy with dark honey and hints of vanilla. It has a somewhat thin mouthfeel which only detracts from it slightly. 

The finish is quite long with warm spicy rye hanging on well after you’ve swallowed. Overall this is an excellent rye with all the stuff you expect of a rye. At $45 it’s a pretty decent value as well. Very enjoyable. 3.75/5."
