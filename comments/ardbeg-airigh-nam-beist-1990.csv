4.5,One of my favorite Ardbegs.  On that edge of in your face peat and starting to get more subtle in the finish.  This is the L8 (2008 edition)
4.5,"nose is a but salty with candy sweetness, smooth peat and smoke, citrus

palate is sweet peat with stronger alcohol sensation, some vanilla, oily 

finish is long and the sweetness and smoke retains

overall a really nice Ardbeg that both has the characteristics of the distillery but has a unique sweet and oily profile"

5.0,"Overall: A creamy dram, sweet, smoky, with citrusy qualities, superb whisky, a top pick of mine, one of the best bottles of scotch I have ever owned. If Corryvreckan is a rockstar, this is like a hug from grandpa (24).  
Color: Medium gold
Nose: Lime skins and cream, vanilla, peat, malt, detergent, something herbal, salted marshmallows, a drop of water brings out the fruity qualities (24)
Body: Medium to full, oily
Taste: Tangy peat, soft heat, limes, little peek of vanilla in there, fluffy puffs of smoke and soot, complex (24)
Finish: Medium to long, soft vanilla, smoke resurging (23)
Score: 95"

5.0,"Tasted at WhiskyFest San Francisco 2017, at Ardbeg seminar

The best whisky of the night at WhiskyFest

Well-balanced, complex

Too bad it is not readily available"

4.0,"If you want to taste Ardbeg's notes of smoke, salt and sweetness in isolation, this whisky will walk you through them one by one. It's a fascinating reference for the Ardbeg vocabulary, but ultimately the sweetness dominates, underscoring how well integrated the current Ardbeg range is. Still, well worth the $14 I paid for 2cl  at Chami Bar in Davos."
