3.0,"Much different than their single malts. For a young whiskey this doesn't really show it. You get a healthy dose of honeyed bourbon spice, while it develops that sweet sherry tang before leaving a crisp woody finish. Most certainly something to be sought after to replace your other everyday Irish sippers."

3.5,"My first taste of this whiskey was a very pleasant experience. A touch hot on the front end, but a nice sweet and fruity taste as well. I’m definitely not done with this distillery’s products."
3.75,"Sweet syrupy nose, hints of vanilla and honeysuckle also appear given some time. Flavour is pretty light with a bit more floral notes showing up. Has a bit of a cream soda or cola flavour as well. Finishes like liquorice. Good budget bottle!"

2.0,"quite simply didn't get it.  tried it at a tasting.  had none of the attractions of an irish whisky for me, with a short and abrupt profile and a thin feel.  grain with no notes.  sure - it was booze.  even ""in-style"" - i don't get it."

3.75,"Introduced to this whiskey at Portstewart Golf Club, Northern Ireland, back in Sept. 2016.  Admittedly, the mystical experience of playing this majestic masterpiece, and host of the 2017 Irish Open, may have  prejudiced my sensibilities, but I found the spirit to be quite likable. This young distillery started as an aging and finishing agent of whiskies acquired elsewhere, but now has a new facility scheduled to open in 2017.  For me, this double barrel offering lacked the sweetness often associated with a blended Irish whiskey, and was more reminiscent of a dry Scottish highlander. The spirit imparts a fruitiness that complements well with elements of vanilla and almond. All in all, this portends a bright future for a concern founded by 5 friends with a dream. I may have rated it higher, save for the spirit's fuzzy heritage."

3.0,"A different style of Irish for me. Still, I like this youthful spirit. The nose is very fruity, but shifts to caramel toffee and vanilla on the palate. It is peppery in the mouth too , but seems a bit rough or has some alcohol taste too. The finish is drying, and some more red fruit come back too. Overall very tasty but a bit off balance. (3.5 stars)"
3.75,"There is something different about this than , say, regular Tullimore D.E.W.--which I also like. I think it must be the slight ""bourbonish"" notes?  Anyway, it's worth drinking."

3.75,"Proof 66 does a nice job of summarizing how this whiskey is aged in both bourbon and sherry barrels. It noses of honey, cereal grains, lemon, and a little fig or raisin, or, perhaps cherry. On the tongue these all come across, but the sherry fruit flavors are not as obvious as the nosing predicted. The finish ends in a sweet spiciness. Distiller rates this an 86, and Whiskeyreviewer gives it a C+. I think I fall between those two. This is good; but, if I am looking for an Irish with a sherry note, I would prefer The Irishman and Powers Signature. I am sure there are others, but these I have in my collection. (Later this week my case of Redbreasts and a Green Spot will arrive. I will post my notes as soon as I am able.)"

Fruity on the noise kind of hot but not unbearable.  Citrusy with green notes, kinda like a mandarin orange with the leaves still on at Christmas, slightly floral like walking near a  patch of daises still in the ground.

Full and sweet on the palate very butterscotch with buckwheat honey and peppercorn.

Finish is spicy and tart, bitter almond extract."

4.0,"I would like to rate this as a 4.1, but this site does not allow that.  this is a tasty Irish whiskey.  for an Irish, it has a creamy, soft mouth feel, it tastes as though it has a little single malt-though, I don't think it does, and is well rounded with a nice sherry accent.  If you can get this for around $30 I would say it is a good deal."

3.0,"Very interesting Irish whiskey. At certain points it tastes like single pot still, other it tastes like a more grain-based spirit. The oak character is a bit overbearing for my liking but very pleasant with sherry and vanilla notes. I would like it if this whiskey only saw one barrel and stayed their longer."
