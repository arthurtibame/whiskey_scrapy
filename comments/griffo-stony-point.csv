2.25,Another pour from yesterday’s socially distanced drinking. This was a unique funky adventure the only way American craft spirits can be. At first sniff I thought I was drinking a lager instead of whisky. It smelled mostly of hops! My buddy said the distillery does use hops in the whisky production. The adventure continued on the palate. Definitely didn’t taste like any whisky I’ve tried. A mixture of cookie dough and sweet’n’sour sauce. Most bizarre. But I applaud these folks for making something different that stands out in a (potentially soon to not be...) crowded market.
