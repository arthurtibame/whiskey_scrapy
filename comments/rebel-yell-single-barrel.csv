5.0,Great oak and complexity. By the end of the bottle I was getting some nice dark cherry flavor. A fantastic bourbon.

4.0,"This is a tale of two bourbons. After hearing positive reviews on this one (some even calling it the special release of the year) I decided to pick up a bottle if I was lucky enough to see it. This is a review for Barrel #4744174. Neat in a glencairn glass the harsh nose gave no indication that this was a wheated bourbon. I got straw, butter, and oak. Lots of barrel and alcohol. Very ""Wild Turkeyish"". On the palate this one is HOT. Lots of oak astringency. Did I mention HOT. The finish is HOT with a lingering musty oak that is very reminiscent of another Heaven Hill Single Barrel 10 year old, Henry McKenna. Much like it's younger blended cousin Larceny, it drinks hotter than its proof. I've had several Barrel Proof pours that weren't this hot. Other than the lingering oak on the finish, I didn't care for this one at all. BUT ADD A SPLASH OF WATER and it's hard to believe that this came out of the same bottle. The alcohol on the nose is replaced by vanilla and pink Bubble Yum bubble gum. The straw and oak are there, but now more in balance. Now it's starting to behave like a wheater. On the palate the vanilla and bubble gum make another appearance along with mint and sweet oak. Very complex. A much smoother finish with mint, vanilla and that nice musty oak lingering. I have never had a whiskey benefit so much from a splash of water. I will definitely enjoy the rest of this bottle and if they will keep the price in the $40's, I'll look for next years release as well."

4.0,"My review is for Barrel # 4744184.  As others on this site have noted, there was a lot of hype surrounding this wheated bourbon, and I've heard more than one person suggest that this is a great alternative to Old Rip Van Winkle 10.  Serving suggestion: add a tiny splash of water and let it sit for about ten minutes; doing this will open up the flavors.  The nose offers vanilla and brown sugar, with a pleasing oak note in the background... you can tell immediately that this is a quality aged bourbon.  I get similar flavors on the palate as well but a really satisfying leather note emerges on the finish that adds complexity to the experience.  It's priced right and will be offered a few times a year. Believe the hype."
4.0,"Barrel #5043516 | Aged Since 05/2006 Nose - Dark brown sugar caramel, oaky vanilla, hints of coffee, roasted sweet nuts, light milk chocolate.
Taste - Very smooth milk chocolate covered dark vanilla caramel, oaky vanilla, hints of sweet mocha foam, lightly drying, hint of cherry at the back of the palate.
Finish - Dark cherry lingers and mixes with a nice oaky vanilla caramel sweetness.
Score - 87/100
Final Thoughts - The nose on this one doesn't do the taste justice. It noses a bit oaky, but it's not as much so once it hits the tongue. Has a nice mix of flavors I find quite enjoyable (coffee, dark caramel, cherry) and sips very well neat. Has enough ""oompf"" to stand up in a cocktail, but try to focus on cherry/chocolate flavors as I think those would go best with this. As always with a single barrel product, be aware of barrel variances and no two barrels are the same."

5.0,"Barrel #4744182, aged since 9/2005. Smells like a wheater, slight floral tones and honey, after a minute it opens up and you get some caramel and butterscotch. Very pleasant nose. Feels heavy on the tongue. Sweet, some butterscotch, then cinnamon hits and the finish is warm. The flavor and spice lingers a bit, and you get a slightly bitter, chocolatey aftertaste. This seems like the perfect proof, you defnitely feel it but it doesn't overwhelm the palate. Quite flavorful. Adding a limestone water ice cube heightened the sweet notes, and interestingly, smoothed it out on the front end yet added a sharpness to the back end. Well done, Luxco. 3/1/17

Smells like a spring day. Grainier this time, smells fuller than when I first cracked open this bottle. Smooth and rich on the tongue, sweet honey notes, clove, and bit of leather and spice that prevents this from being cloying. Butterscotch aftertaste, with a hint of dark chocoate bitterness, and nice warmth going down. Delicious. 5/17/17"

3.0,"This was one of the most fawned over releases of '16. An age stated 100 proof wheated bourbon? Wheater fanboys rejoiced and subsequently swooned. Well, I bought into it and had a blind SBS w/ a WSR store select and Lot B: Slight astringency, light on the nose like the others. Thin cherries, plain ol’ white sugar. Finish is fine but fleeting. There’s a medicinal astringency here; it doesn’t announce its presence right away and isn’t aggressively offensive, but it’s there and kind of gets in the way of really enjoying this neat. In the end I'd rather pay $18 for a bottle of WSR, they're both fairly boring but even boring bourbon is still bourbon."

5.0,"$49.99 @ TW. Barrel # 5083212. Aged since 09/06.
This is a real gem of a Bourbon. Firstly it's an age stated single barrel wheated bourbon sourced from Heaven Hill (Parker's Heritage). Secondly how often can you say a wheated Bourbon is both sweet and spicy!
Nice and sweet upon entry. Vanilla, butterscotch and a hint of saltwater taffee. Warming clove and baking spices on the mid palatte with a very long finish with oak, sweet tobacco and more vanilla. Wonderful stuff. This one stand's up tall next to Weller 12 and don't be shocked if you pick it in a blind taste test (as I have!). If you see it , buy 2. The 2017 batch is pretty hard to come by now with only 2,000 cases produced."

Wow, this Bourbon just never disappoints. Move over Weller 12 yr, I think this is now my favorite wheater. I loved both the 2016 and 2017 editions and the 2018 is fantastic. Upon entry you are hit with a wonderful butterscotch notes with some vanilla that then gives way to an array of baking spices. Mid pallette features a spice swell that recedes to a wonderful oak and tobacco driven long finish. It's a touch dry and lingers for ages. So smooth and viscous! What a knock out! This is allocated this year for good reason! I was fortunate enough to pick up 3 bottles! If you see it it's an instant buy!"

Finish: medium-long loaded with bright orange cream, almond bitterness, and well-integrated barrel spice (cardamon, clove, and orange zest)

Summary: Time spent in barrel really shows up and allows this to unfold and become complex. Lots of spice gained in the process. Young wheaters can be super sweet, but this expression gives you so much more to chew on.

Nose: banana nut bread, sweet wheat

Palate: less complicated than the nose. Muted toffee. Some spices. Slight citrus. 

Finish: short but rich while it lasted. 

At $50 this is a decent bottle. I’ve seen this much higher recently though which speaks to the wheated mania that bourbon is suffering. Seems gimmicky, overpriced. 

Honestly, I’d recommend the basic Rebel Yell over this because it’s way cheaper and doesn’t pretend to be complicated. It’s just a simple sweet sipper. This on the other hand is a hype bourbon. 

Rebel Year 10-year is more complex than the bottom shelf offering, but $50+ better? Not to me."

Richer than the standard bottom shelf Rebel Year, the quality of this bourbon is about the same as easy to find wheaters such as Makers 46. While the nose is quite good, the palate and finish are not as complex and a bit bitter and brittle. 

While Heaven Hill is reported to be the source for this bourbon, it’s nowhere near the quality of the Old Fitzgerald aged stated releases. 

I’ve seen this whiskey upwards of $90 and it’s not worth that. But for a 10-year-old wheated bourbon it’s quite unique. However I’d rather have a Makers 46 over this any day. And since that bourbon is readily available and less expensive, I’m docking this bourbon a few ticks."

Have you ever smelled imitation corn lure for deer hunting. It has such and incredibly sweet corn smell and it smells so good you want to taste it this is almost that sweet on the nose. The Vanilla shines the brightest with the corn coming in second. Palate you pick up the vanilla almost like a vanilla creme right away the palate and nose are in sync.

3.25,"I've had my eye out for this for a while, but have never actually seen it on shelves around here before now. Interestingly, the label says this was barreled in 2006, so I guess some cases of the original 2016 release were ""lost"" at the distributor for 2+ years before showing up in a store now (Sept 2019).

Nose - First nosing was a little hot, but after a few minutes that faded and was followed by subtle notes of red apples, graham crackers, caramel, spices, and oak. 

Palate - medium bodied, the palate follows the nose with apples, a bit of orange citrus, caramel, and honey grahams. Drier and spicier on the back end than expected.

Finish - quite spicy, with cinnamon, baking spices, and drying oak that trails off rather quickly. 

Adding a few drops of water didn't really change the nose, although it brought out some sweeter notes on the palate.

This was a surprise to me. It wasn't as rich/sweet as Weller, Maker's, etc. Oak and spice played a much bigger part, and it was drier than I would expect even for 10 yrs of aging. It also didn't really have much of the character I expect from wheated bourbon (I always get graham crackers in the good ones, and bread dough in the not-good ones). While there was a hint of graham, I'm not sure I would have guessed this was a wheater if I'd tasted it blind. Of course being a single-barrel product it's hard to know if this bottle is typical for the expression or slightly off-profile.

All in all it's pretty good if not exactly what I was expecting. I liked it, but found myself wishing it was a little richer and not quite as dry. At $60 I don't regret the purchase, but probably wouldn't buy another."
4.25,null
3.75,"I've heard a few questions on better bourbons for the money when I've given some lower scores to some of the ""legends"".  Well here's the secrete!  

Nose - Cherry wood, spicy oak, a bit of peanut butter (never got this before on this one), vanilla oak, i'm starting to get tobacco and hay.  Just to point out I remember this being more sweet and old oak vs right now it's a bit more nutty.  

Taste - So I did have some scotch before this, a very vanilla and sweet one and it's odd but I'm getting so much nutty flavor here I've never gotten before.  Old oak, spicy, candy, touch of nut, vanilla, caramel.  

Rebel Yell 10 is perhaps the best for the money wheater on the market.  It's insanely good and for those who keep chasing price...this was 70 for me and I know you can get it for as low as 50.  

Of course, not barrel proof so the mouth feel suffers some, it's a touch more spicy and the alcohol is a touch harsh.  So yeah lets not go crazy this is priced like a daily drinker (at least for us scotch drinkers I know bourbon guys want 30 or less for that) so don't expect to get blown away.  

Anyway giving this the same score at ECBP A119, 3.75.  Just really hard for me to give a 4.0 to most bourbons, I just like more age and or finishing to get there.  If you want a wheated bourbon, get this not weller.  That's my advice at least."

Nose: Very much what I'd expect from an age stated 10 year wheated bourbon.  Vanilla, honey, some grassy notes, and quite a bit of corn.  Almost like a corn pudding.  Butterscotch, caramel, and toasted pecans.

Flavor: Very sweet, poached apple, cinnamon, corn flakes, and more honey.  A little thinner than I'd expect from the age.

Finish:  Long finish, sweet and spicy with quite a bit of black pepper.  Some baking spices like clove and cardamom and a little bit of barrel bitter that I found a hair off putting.  Finishes with toasted pecans and barrel bitter.

Overall a good wheated bourbon but nothing to get super excited about.  It's nice but a little bland and thin."

4.25,This was an interesting pour.  The nose was initially off-putting almost like glue or plastic with alcohol but after letting sit for a while that seemed to fade.  The palate is wood and caramel and better than I expected based on the nose.  The finish was really great with more oak and spice then a distinct cherry note that was very nice.  Will definitely try and find more.
3.25,"Grassy/earthiness on the nose. Vanilla and spiciness on the palate, with some of the grass/earthy notes slightly coming through on the palate. Spicy lingering finish."
4.5,Better than the newer batches of Antique
4.25,"Cherry pie nose, singular. Starts with more of the same on the palate, adding molasses, and finishing with black licorice and finally pepper in your throat. The licorice lingers on your tongue."

4.25,"For my 100th review, a bottle I’ve been wanting to get my hands on but never had the opportunity to until now. Rebel Yell 10 Year. Actually this bottle is more of a 14 yr. (Barrel # 4765301. Barreling date 02/06) On to the review! 

Nose is very soft. Mostly fruity with apple, peach, and fig along with some floral notes of honeysuckle. If that sounds appealing, well it is. 

Palate opens with honey, vanilla, apple, and baked sugared peaches before transitioning into a mid-palate of cinnamon, clove, and pepper, and those flavors also carry into the medium length finish. Earthy undertone (mushroom?) as well in the finish. After  everything else fades you’re left with a lovely lingering aftertaste of caramel flan. Pretty complex. I do love a whiskey that can go from sweet to spicy to sweet again and this delivers with a smooth, cohesive ride. 

Mouthfeel is creamy and on the delicate side.

So yeah, as my first wheater of this age I do get the phenomenon; the softness is real, but yet the flavors are fully actualized and not lacking in depth at all; no easy feat. Reminds me a little of EH Taylor Single Barrel with regards to the flavor integration and earthiness. At $70, it’s a little pricey but I feel the quality to cost ratio is about right. I’d buy it again for that price if the opportunity presented itself. Anything less than that and it’s a steal."
4.5,Smooth and very good taste.   One of my favorites for the price

4.25,"Nose: caramel, corn, little spice

Palate: sweet initially. Little spice. Vanilla a lot too. Reminds me of wild turkey 10 year with a little more spice. 

Finish: vanilla medium"
4.0,"Vanilla, butterscotch, cherry and oak on the nose. Palate is in line with the nose with a good spice kick. Nice heat. Tasty wheated bourbon but not as complex as I prefer. Good daily sipper if you like wheaters. Probably won't purchase another bottle at $65."
4.0,Smooth with a little heat
3.0,Barrel 5008632 Nose is a little weird. Almost like a turpentine but just a little hint of it mostly just good ole alcohol and a little vanilla. Taste is light orange on the front end with a light spice and a light burn it’s a decent bourbon just not a full bourbon. I had another bottle from a different barrel and it was much better.   If I had not had tatested that one this would be a lower score.

3.5,"Nose: Sweet corn, orange zest, sweet mild vanilla, freshly mown hay, cherry flavoured sweets, a mild note of good oak cask. It's a very friendly nose (did I mention it's sweet?) with just enough heft. [The dry-glass smells of sandalwood and sweat].

Palate: Sweet arrival, some extremely well behaved mild spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, caraway) which persist through the development, gaining further sweetness in the process. The development brings out orange notes and a nutty quality together with vanilla, caramel and brown sugar. The texture is good and you certainly don't notice that this is 100 proof.

Finish: Medium. A little sweet spiced vanilla on the aftertaste.

A nice bourbon. Oh dear, is that damning with faint praise? I hope not because this is very drinkable and there are no off-notes anywhere. It's a good, easy and enjoyable bourbon that starts off with just the right amount of oak and character, progresses through mild spiciness and finishes on a sweet note. Good stuff - not much more I can say, it's just ""good"".

I did notice, however, that in Australia this is $160, which I think is absurd and if I had paid that much I'd be rather annoyed because it's just not *that* good. I'd gladly pay half that but to charge the same for this as for Springbank 12 year old? I think not.

Thanks to @Soba45 for the tasting sample.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars

PS - Don't add water, ice or anything else - don't muck about with this - just enjoy it neat."

2.75,Having two Santas send you presents is a bit like having divorced parents who both shower you in xmas presents each year! This one was from American Santa aka @PBMichiganWolverine. Well it's definitely unusual. I'm not too sure if it's the 10 year single barrel or just single barrel but either way definitely not for me. It's just a weird sickly profile. Oh well given I've had an amazing run of other great stuff in the package I was bound to hit a road bump somewhere along the line. Thanks pbm!
