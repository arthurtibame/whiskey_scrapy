3.25,"This single malt was distilled at the New Zealand based Willowbrook Distillery at Dunedin. It was then aged for 6 years in ex-bourbon casks and 10 years in ex-wine French oak casks. The nose is full of raisins, strawberry preserves, honey, and a brown sugar note almost leaning towards root beer. On the palate, the influence of the French oak wine casks is immediately apparent, with dark stewed fruits complementing mild hints of cloves, gingersnaps, vanilla, and a non-specific nuttiness. Further sips reveal watermelon rinds, fig jam, light honey and herbal notes. Unfortunately overshadowing many of the delicate flavors of this single malt is a robust barrel bitterness. My guess is this contributed to the rationale for bottling this whisky at 40% ABV. Sadly this leads to slightly diluted flavors overall. This is an overall pleasant and complex whisky that just doesn’t reach its full potential. In many ways it reminds me of a lighter, lower proof, and less well rounded Balcones Single Malt, despite its higher age statement and price tag."
