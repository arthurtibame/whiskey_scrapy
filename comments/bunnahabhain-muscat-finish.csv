4.25,"Need to up this to 4.25.  After having it again, once it’s sitting out for a while, the heat really goes away and you’re left with the sweet salty balance.  Really well done.  Once you have it sitting out, you can then also isolate which muscat casks...I’m guessing Italian Asti white based on not too sweet, dry, and color."
3.0,"This is one of those times I wish distilleries were a bit more clearer on their labeling.  Muscat is a pretty broad range of wines ranging from a dry sweet Italian white wine ( Asti Moscato from Piedmont) to yellow ( Moscato Giallo) to pink ( Moscato Rosa ) to dark purple ( Muscat Hamburg).  It’s even a liqueur.  But characteristics are basically floral.  So...this is a 11yr old hand filled Bunna matured fully in Muscat casks.   Pretty much available at the distillery only.  But, I’ve no idea if I’m dealing with white, pink or yellow wine casks.  The color in glass is pale bronze..so maybe a yellow or white Muscat.  Aroma:  sunflower seeds, hemp oil.  Flavor:  dry, herbaceous, probably a bit salty and sweet.  I’m not getting floral at all.  It’s an interesting experiment.  Not my favorite Bunna, but I’m appreciative of it since one can’t simply buy this from a local store or online."
