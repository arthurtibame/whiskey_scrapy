      Finish -- a solid Rye kick!"
4.0,"I agree, vanilla is very prevalent.  Complex and delicious"
5.0,"Nose - Honey, vanilla, caramel, pineapple, faint hint of mint?
Taste - Slightly oily/creamy/buttery mouthfeel, vanilla, oak, cinnamon, hint of bitterness from oak.
Finish - Very pleasant creamy vanilla and cinnamon, gradual oak warming mouthfeel, with a slight orange pith bitterness to cap the finish.

5.0,"Wow nose is so woody (lots of oak). Followed up with dried fruits and hints of vanilla and honey. Erm maybe very faint of alcohol?

Taste is same as the nose but fuller and slightly more complex. Lots of oak, some honey, pepper, thick and oily!

It finishes long. 

The best bourbon I tasted so far! Bourbon mark 93/100!"

4.0,"A highly-rated Kentucky-made bourbon that can't even be purchased here in the States?  Now you see why we had to try this rare (for an American) dram while in Paris.  In some respects, this is going to be a familiar pour for someone who's had Blanton's Single Barrel.  The additional ABV, however, reveals some surprising shifts in the Blanton's profile.  I found the rye spice to be dialed down, and the woody, cedar notes to be amped up.  The difference between 93 proof and 103 proof adds an extra level of intensity to this bourbon.  It is a well-composed, well-balanced bourbon that captures the wide spectrum of bourbon flavors without any one of them being overstated.  But the price difference between this and regular Blanton's is much higher than the price difference between this and Straight from the Barrel, which is a cask-strength bruiser.  At $85, I would lean toward alternatives, or pony up the extra $10 for Straight from the Barrel."

4.0,"It's hard for me to judge bourbans as I'm not a big fan. For the most part they seem a bit same same, shades of the same thing etc. although there are awesome exceptions. Finishing or peating to provide more variety just doesn't seem that prevelant? Anyway rant over. Coming off the back of tasting Springbank 15 it was going to be hard to top that one but this didn't do to badly at all.  It definitely exceeded my expectations. Nice rich oak, caramel, toffee, vanilla etc. Alcohol very well integrated for it's strength and especially so for a bourbon. I'd say definitely high 3's and probably the best value for money bourbon I've had at around $60USD so a 4 it is"

4.0,"Strong nose, rich full of toffee, sugar, orchard fruit, soap, some vanilla. On the palate, sharp on the tip of your tongue, sweetness envelops followed by wood notes, warm spice and leather notes at the end. Medium finish, some lingering cacao nibs. Just the right amount of heat. Towards the end of my glass I started to detect some nuttiness, a flavor profile I greatly enjoy. Nicely done. I can see how for some, this will be right in their wheelhouse. For now, I think I prefer the relative smoothness of the regular Single Barrel, or the intense explosion of the SFTB; the Gold, while a great pour, seems to have some strengths of both but not quite fully, so in a way it's neither here nor there. Don't get me wrong, this is worth seeking out, but I strongly prefer the SFTB and I think the regular Single Barrel is solid on its own right. 5/3/17

5.0,"January 2017 - I'm in San Francisco, my calfs burning from the dizzying hills that plague this town, I can clearly see why Uber was invented here first. I hear a 2BD apt in this town still gets you a roommate on a 100k salary - but WOW! what a beautiful metropolis! I can see the drippings and chiselings of the cities rich culture on every street corner. I'm here on business making yet another super hero film for the biggest of big screens- we have one week left in principle photography - and as usual I'm hog tied to the production day and night -  excited to wrap this one; I havent been off a production in over 3 years.  Sounds exciting eh? Well yes- I'm lucky to be involved with such a great team; however after 12 hour days 6 days a week - not even a naked cocain ridden cheerleader pool party in Fiji would be fun anymore.. maybe.  .  Anyway - its a cool and beautiful night in SF,  myself and a senior member of the crew decided to hit the bar down from our hotel called ""The Saratoga"" - it's a fancy place, well dressed staff, dimly lit, I'd imagine patrons utilize this place for impressing dates with sophistication and priciness- people are dressed in button-downs, scarves and fine leather - and there we were... in hoodies, winter caps and dickies work pants- a class act we were not... but even the highest of formalities won't stop these whiskey crusaders -  On the menu I see BLANTON'S GOLD - I know this bottle to be imported.. not imported like your corner store Tecate - but imported like Afghani Opium - thanks to the genius ---AMERICANS--- over at buffalo trace sending the good stuff from KENTUCKY overseas, and then forcing  fans to basically smuggle it back one by one- its hard to find and expensive here in the US (thumbs down).   
      Nose: complex and fruity, citrus, vanilla. 
      Palate: Bold toffee, carmel, berries, maple syrup, grenadien, oak, spice. 
      Finish: Rich, thick, it coats your mouth and leave you wanting more. its an experience like non-other. I was totally caught off gard on this one as I feel its significantly better than the standard Blanton's.
      We wrapped up at over $600 and 8 drinks between the two of us, stumbling jovialy to exit the nice ""first date"" bar. I recall that this was one of the best bourbons I'v ever tasted -"

4.0,"It's 4:20 am. On a friday where only 3 guys will be at work and we will probalby drown in shit today. Perfect time to get a quick drink in before all that. Also on a quick sidenote, changed my Username from 45 to 357. I finally gave in to my inner wheelgunner....

A while back I tried the Blanton's Special Reserve and was not very impressed to be honest. Was avoiding those weird hose topped bottles for a while, but then decided that I needed another go, and the Gold Edition sounded rather nice. Spoiler, it is. This is a big step up, and the increase in ABV probably didn't hurt either. 

On the nose you get a decent base of oak notes, kinda like a wooden bowl where the rest of the aroma is poured into. I get the Bourbon typical vanilla, some raisins, dried yet still a bit juicy plums, dash of cinnamon and maybe something that could be cherry. 

Taste starts with a slightly burny mix of vanilla and brown, caramelized sugar. The cherries are making themselves known here, without any guesswork. And to round it off a bit (or add some spikybits, depending on how you view it) there is plenty of oak spice and some pepper. Those 2 are also the ones that continue to linger for a while, giving it a spicy and not very sweet aftertaste. That is good, while I like sweetness in my whisky, I hate clingy sticky sweetness. At least in Bourbon, Speyside sherry bombs are a different matter. 

All in all, this is a signifianct improvement over the other Blanton I tried. Might look into more of them for my bourbon needs. They are still a hell of a lot less expensive than the EH Taylors (this is around 70, Taylor 100-120). 

So yeah, good Bourbon, good start in the day. Now let's just hope that people don't remember that we work on days between holidays and weekends....Cheers."

Body has licorice and cinnamon, and I get a very oily, sugary, nutty finish. I can’t get over how sweet this guy is from start to finish, and this is the first bourbon I’ve had where the sweetness doesn’t come with a fruity flavor. Just syrupy, sugary sweet. After a few pours, I also began getting milk chocolate on the finish.

I think I prefer this to standard Blanton’s, and I hope there’s more to that opinion than the pretty golden horsie. No promises."

5.0,"* My bottle: Dumped on 9/6/16 from barrel no. 116, warehouse H, rick no. 17. Bottle no. 252"" 51.5% abv.

Nose: The first impression is oak in many guises - charred barrel, new oak panelling, my grandmother's polished oak dresser. Then leather (a new leather couch) and the aroma of a fine cigar. Arising like a mist from this oaken grove there are aromas of vanilla (very present), apricot liqueur, clove oil and cinnamon. I close my eyes and imagine standing on a wooded hill watching the sunset over rolling fields of wheat at the end of a hot day. Vibrantly autumnal, and surprisingly after a while you realize that it is actually a very cereal-forward nose. (PS - the dry-glass nose is strongly sandalwood).

Palate: A woody, dry and almost astringent arrival that is at the very edge of being too forceful, but never quite steps over the line. Exquisite management of the rye component! This is followed by a remarkably measured and complex development with diverse sweet notes seeming to flow into the liquid instead of arising from it. A very cohesive palate that is an absolute joy to taste, and so richly textured it is almost oily. More rich oak, mocha coffee, hazelnuts, pecan nuts, dark warm spices (ginger, cinnamon, clove), liquorice, dried figs and dried apricots, a touch of very dark, strong honey, freshly ground white pepper, menthol, a delightful herby note (mint? sage?) and some faint orange and mango fruit juice hints scurrying about.

Finish: Medium-long and multifaceted. First the robust and captivating sweeter flavours from the palate fade to a toffee/caramel finish, then the more subtle notes take over and continue into a much longer finish with a tobacco, liquorice and spice finale.

For my first review of 2018 I thought I'd turn to something more upmarket than the somewhat quotidian rums I've been tasting lately, and Blanton's Gold most certainly did not disappoint.

Do not add water to this whiskey! It should be a federal crime. Adding water blurs everything, highlights the spices too much and raises a bitter note in the finish that is undetectable when neat. It ruins the whiskey. Besides which, it is unnecessary. Blanton’s Gold is smooth, cultivated, refined and intended for neat sipping. You know you are drinking something much stronger than 80 proof, but at no time is there a trace of burn or any crass pummeling of the nose or tastebuds.

Overall - stunning. Simply stunning. Poised, magisterial, serene, complex, but approachable. Pour a good sized dram of this and ponder it for at least an hour with no distractions other than some good music. I'd recommend Beethoven or Mahler. 

Blanton's Original is a very fine dram, but this is outstanding, particularly at what is comparatively a bargain-basement price! It's not just one of the best bourbons I've tasted, it's one of the best whisk(e)ys I've tasted. This is the Springbank 21 of bourbons.

“Outstanding” : 5 stars"

5.0,"First off Distiller, that is a really weird review. Just sayin. 

Nose- Caramel green apple! Yep, I’m gonna like this one.
Body- Sweat tea tannins are prevalent with orange marmalade and burnt brown sugar throughout. The green apple dry citrus note is there but more in mouthfeel than flavor. There is a spicy tongue tingle throughout the body and into the finish.
Finish- The caramel green apple returns in the finish with just a hint of spearmint.

This is a great one. Out of the original, gold, and sftb, this one wins best of show for me. I like the rich, thick brown sugar body of the sftb but the finish is just too hot neat. The gold really is the best of both worlds, full flavored while also approachable neat. Pisses me off that I have to have this imported. I really don’t understand why Blanton’s screws Americans like that."

This is a single barrel, 51,5% ABV bourbon, made with a sour mash of corn, rye and malted barley.

Each bottle is hand filled and labeled and then individually numbered. This is bottle no. 93 from barrel no. 524. Color is dark amber and amazing.

🌕🌕🌕🌖🌑 NOSE •
Nose for me is rather excellent, with a balanced vanilla and honey note. Also pretty notable in there is cherry (not sherry). Fumes can be decent when you first pour it, so let it breathe if needed.

🌕🌕🌕🌕🌘 PALATE •
The palate is pungent, with base vanilla, thick orchard honey, lots of spices, mainly peppery rye. Quite oily in the mouth. Rounded off with notes of oak also. Burn is what I'd expect from 51,5% ABV.

🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗 FINISH • 
On the finish you get clear toffee and vanilla notes, when they are done you get a drying sensation and notes of lingering cream, butter and charred oak. Finish is rather long and enjoyable.

🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗 OVERALL •
One of the best bourbons I've had and I think I have a fancy for single barrel ones too. Rich, oily and all the desired bourbon notes, cherry nose and pepper rye to elevate it further."

4.0,"So for this tasting I had a half ounce pour generously offered by a friend of a friend so I did my best to savor each and every drop.

Nose: The nose on this is like hot cinnamon and baking spices with a fruity undertone but other than those notes you get some cherries and light brown sugar (stereotypical bourbon notes)

Palate: The first thing I noticed from sipping this dram was how much it coated my entire tongue and the light oily sweetness it came with the coating. Right after adjusting to the light coating on my tongue I got all warm sweetness and some pepper undertones that were a bit of a surprise after getting an oily sweetness overcoat on my tongue. I enjoyed the surprise but for the finish I was hoping for something a little more complex other than baking spices and pepper notes. Was hoping for more of that oily sweetness it first started off with. 

Overall: When I tried this I had to luxury of trying all three versions of the Blantons lineup and this ranks as my favorite from all 3! Def would recommend to anyone who enjoys the regular Blantons."

4.25,Beautiful Blanton flavours but turned up to 10. Very sweet with not much oak influence. For me it has a wonderful cotton candy finish. Through a sea of bourbon this bottle really stood out for me when I first tasted it. It’s something different then your regular glass of bourbon.

5.0,"This bourbon is one step up in level from original Blanton's found in the States(if you are lucky enough to find it in a liquor store and not already allocated). 

Won two of these bottles in CA auction and am glad I did as this is a very enjoyable drink. 

I find that the gold is a little more sweeter like honey but with a little more bite than the original. A little water opens it up to great things. 

I recommend this bourbon for anyone who likes or loves Blanton's as well. Just know that this bottle is originally sold overseas."

4.25,"Very similar, but strikingly different to the original. Doing a side by side as we speak. Nose is full of vanilla, caramel, honey, tobacco, raisins, and what my nose is calling cherry.

The palate is a very smooth liquid cinnamon mixed with cream, vanilla and finished with an oak & pepper undertone. Thick creamy mouthfeel.

It finishes medium to long and has a nice mouth burn. What sets to gold version apart from the original is slightly more honey, and significantly more spice."""

5.0,"This is pure 103 proof magic!

The nose starts with vanilla, sugar cookies and molasses. As the tastes develop the smell of brown sugar and nutmeg come to the surface.

The taste is even better starting with cinnamon, maple cookies, a spicy honey that reminds me of fireweed honey, and butter. Just butter.

The finish is slow and tastes like a green caramel apple with a touch of bitter notes."

4.25,"The extra punch from the 103 proof raises the bar and makes this actually worthy of a top shelf bourbon. This stuff is actually worth hunting down instead of the average Blanton’s. Buy the regular stuff to give to your boss for a present, but buy this (if your lucky enough to find it) when you want a drink of fine American exported bourbon."
4.75,"A sample from dthom as part of the ""Whiskey Transfer Program"".  I'm very excited to try this as I'm a fan of Blanton's but feel like SFTB is too high proof.  I've often felt that the sweet spot of proof versus flavor for bourbon is 100-112 proof and this one is 103 proof.

Nose: Smells like...Blanton's.  Shocker!  Heavy caramel apple, vanilla, dark sugars, but more cinnamon and allspice than I'm used to and some background yeasty bread notes.

Flavor:  More dark sugars and poached apple but with a lot of barrel char on the front with lots of baking spices.  

Finish: Quite a bit of spice and barrel char offset the sweet notes and finishes a little drying and peppery.  Medium long finish.

I'd say this is my favorite Blanton's to date.  More complex than the traditional single barrel which has always been my one issue, it's a little simple."

4.5,"Neat. Neck pour from the other side of the world.  Different nose than I was expecting.  Tons of caramel and nougat.  Hint of spearmint and cinnamon.  Lots of vanilla the deeper I go.

Creamy, delightful feel.  Pure sugar on the tongue with a hint of apple.  Transitions back to deep caramel, vanilla and nougat.  Hint of cinnamon and honeycomb on the legs.  Legs go for miles.

Regular Blanton’s doesn’t compare at all to this.  I just tried regular and it’s so thin and bland by comparison.  Somehow the legs from the Gold even overpowered the regular.  Glad this bottle made its way into my collection."

On the front end of the pallet classic oak a little bit of cherry, heat comes in and finishes a little sweet and that ky hug. It’s so much better than regular blantons. Regular blantons is good but for me doesn’t live up to the hype this however does."

5.0,Right mix of flavor and punch. Brown sugar and caramel
3.75,"Nose- raisins, honey, peaches, ethanol, wood, vanilla, oak

Palate- wood, oak, dark fruits, honey, canned peaches, orange zest, pepper and rye spices on the finish 

Finish- long, balanced finish with notes of bright citrus and toasted oak

Not that much of a step up from regular blanton’s, if a step up at all. Nice bright citrus notes, but a little too much oak for me at times... with a surprising amount of heat. Bottle design is amazing, of course. I would rather have 3 bottles of regular blanton’s than one gold"
