5.0,"Today i have achieved 5k followers on my instagram account (thewhiskritic) and decided to celebrate it in the best way possible: with a Dalmore Quintessence sample. 

Ok, lets start with my overall conclusion for this dram. It is not a begginer's dram. It is by far the most complex, different and difficult dram i have ever had. In a good way.

Lets add some perspective here: this dram was made in limited proportions by Richard Patterson when he celebrated his 50th anniversary in charge of the Dalmore Distillery (how old is he?) 

It has been matured initially in american ex-bourbon casks (as most Dalmores) and then it was finished in 5 different californian red wine casks: Zinfandel, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. 

Bottled at 45%abv, AMAZING red old oak color.

On the nose, well it depends on how much time passes:

First 5 minutes: Grapes, Lemon, Glazed pork, Orange old peel, Meaty; Citric but special. Syrup. Its not that powerful in the aroma at the beggining but definitively different.

After 5 mins: blackberry marmalade. Blackberries. Wine. Hints of chocolate
When it breaths, it releases milk powder aroma notes. 

After 10 minutes: banana. Maple syrup.
It turns super sweet. Dehydrated fruits.
Plums.

SO FREAKING COMPLEX.

Time for a sip (i got only about 3 sips with one 3cl sample, lets make them count). 

On the palate: It doesn't feel like whisky at all. Super light, Super winey. Chocolate, Tobbacco, some Bitter notes. spicy.

After first sip chocolate invades the nose. Oranges bathed in chocolate is the exact aroma note now.

AFTERTASTE WAS FANTASTIC. Long as a monday; Allspice, Pepper, Grape astringent, tannin, Ginger

Incredible finish very winey. Clove. Marvelous.  Orange zest aromas go crazy after the second sip. Chocolate and citric notes are now predominant. Mouth drying as wine. 

Overall i don't think this is the best whisky i have ever had (full bottle goes for around 1000 pounds in the U.K.), but it is the most challenging, complex, beautifully crafted whisky i have tasted. I give it a 100 points, because it is what whisky lovers and critics want, complexity, emotions and something different. Great dram, i wouldn't pay 1000 pounds for it (or for any other whisky), but definitively a joyful experience. Slaintè Mhath!"
5.0,"Nose：Sponge cake, blackberry jam, vanilla, honey, peach.
Palate：Toffee, cinnamon buns, buttered toast, jam, wine, ginger.
Finish：Long and velvety. Berry jam, buttered toast, brown sugar."
4.5,"Nose : Apple and vanilla give the first impression, followed by a bit of spice reminiscent of the wine finish. The final nose impression is strong on citrus.

Taste : Smooth and sweet, apple mix with the wine grape to bring an interesting acidity. Vanilla and citrus come after for an interesting complexity.

Finish : Vanilla, citrus and malt lead the show. Quite short, but nice.

A great bottle, but a way too hefty price tag!"
