3.0,"Nose: Immediately very fruity (apples and pairs mainly) with a background of vanilla and caramel and a prominent grassy, honey note. There is a quality to the nose that is very reminiscent of a good blended whisky. The sweetness builds over time but it remains brisk and not cloying. [The dry glass aroma is mainly light ashy smoke].

Palate: A lightly oily and sweet arrival with fruity notes (apple and pear again). As it develops some vanilla and honey becomes apparent, and then there is a wave of very strong esters like fruit flavoured cordial syrup. A little orange essence and chocolate, caramel malted milk, and a touch of peppery spice. There is a metallic note (only slight) but it jars the palate a little.

Finish: Medium/short. Fruity and caramel notes that fade into a slightly bittersweet aftertaste with the metallic quality remaining.

This is an obviously young single malt. It's very estery and spirit led and the casks were good but not first-fill. The nose lacks the depth and complexity of a good single malt, but it is nevertheless pleasant and refreshing.

The overall profile is very like that of a quality blended scotch and the whisky works nicely as a mixer with soda and ice. Dilution tames the fruity characteristics a little on both the nose and palate and is recommended.  Actually, with just a dash of plain water it makes a very nice quaffing malt on a hot day, and I'm sure it would be right at home in a highball.

At the price it is good value and it would be fine as an occasional alternative to one's usual mixing blend. It's not far short of 3.5 stars.

""Above Average"" : 3 stars"
