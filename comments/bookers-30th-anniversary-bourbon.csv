4.5,Incredibly smooth. Considering how hot Bookers can run this is pleasant. Picked up plenty of vanilla off the barrel

4.5,"Ya know, i’m really not a huge booker’s fan. It’s pretty decent bourbon, but i don’t agree with the high marks it receives, it’s not really that great. Its strong and flavorful but harsh and rushed. 

But...this bottle of booker’s is something different. Beam figured out a way to eliminate the harsh part of booker’s and leave the strength behind. It isn’t nearly the flavor complexity of say george t stagg or elijah craig bp, but it is a solid solid bourbon. Now the price point...no, ridiculous. I had it at a bar, i had to try it, but i didn’t pay for it. Way too expensive for what your getting. I can get a lot of other bourbons for less. So yea its a special addition, but still, too much cash. I would pass unless you get a free drink."

Good luck finding a bottle. I lucked out finding this."

4.75,"Nose - Dark chocolate and caramelized sugar

Palate - Rich and fiery immediately, a lot more heat than the rest of the Booker’s I’ve had. Typical oily and slight taste of nuts/butterscotch, sweet trail and a mixture of spices the whole way through

What a pleasure to be able to taste (thanks to a Jim Beam employee), absolutely worth the money for a pour - don’t pass it up!"

2.0,"Wish I had something extraordinary to say about this bottle.  I really wanted to like it.  The nose is fantastic.  The taste was nothing different than any other Booker's bottling and the finish.... The finish was the worst part.  The finish can make or break a good drink, and in this case it definitely broke it.  I read enough to know and expect a short dry finish. SO, I was prepared for that.  What I wasn't prepared for, was the tartness.  Almost makes my face twinge just thinking about it.  Sadly, sadly disappointed in this $200.  I won't be keeping the other bottle."
5.0,I was lucky enough to get my hands on a bottle of this incredible bourbon. Me and three of my best friends had pours.... and agreed that this is really special. Do not pass up the opportunity to try if you get the opportunity.

5.0,"I have a bottle of this which I bought for $250, but I had a chance to try a pour last week as well, while I was away on a business trip to Denver.  I was quite surprised to see it sitting pretty at eye level in the hotel bar.  Got myself a pour and had it while developing a slide deck on taking 6 operating centers into 3 regional centers.  Fun.  So..this pour bought back memories.  Back at Univeristy of Michigan, I dated this one girl, we’ll call her “A”.  She was old money.  Extremely wealthy parents.  She lived off campus in an amazing apartment that she owned (her logic, and she was right, was that she’d be better off owning and selling when she graduates).  I lived in a dorm, working as an RA to make ends meet while my tuition was covered by scholarship.  She drove a BMW, while I drove a Huffy 10 speeder.  So, one day she calls me at 3am.  “I’m coming over now.  It’s urgent, I need to tell you something.  And you’ll need to sit down for it”, while sobbing away.  I’m thinking “damnit.  Okay, so she’s pregnant.  I have 3 more years to go, and I’m sure I’ll get a job...we’ll get married, and it’ll be fine”.  But no...I’m freaking out thinking it’ll be 3 years of hell with two college kids going through classes and taking care of a new born.  I’m sweating a storm and sh%*ing bricks.  Do I need a third job? Will her dad cover us?  Hell, I can sell my Huffy for a set of diapers.  And her Beamer can probably get us one year of formula.  Okay,  So...she comes over, sobbing and crying.  I’m ready to get the news of “congrats...you’re the baby daddy”.  Instead...” I need to tell you something.  I’m not a pre-med major.  I’m not even in college.  I’m just taking my dad’s money, and spending it.  I’m living a lie...and I needed to come out clean to you”.  I give a huge sigh of relief...a world of burden suddenly comes off my shoulder.  I mean, I knew she wasn’t the sharpest knife in the drawer (She couldn’t point out where my lungs were...which was a bit concerning for a pre-med ), but I figured she was just bottom of her class.  Anyway...this whiskey bought back those memories.  I went in expecting this hard oaky hit, like being hit with a 2x4.  It’s  a 30th anniversary...I’m sure there’s gotta be some old liquid there.  I went in thinking I’m going to be hit with tannins and wood.  It’s gonna be strong.  Good thing I’m already sitting down for it.  But maybe I shouldn’t be working on corporate consolidations...might axe off some poor shmuck for being in the wrong 3x3 grid.  Afterall, the nose indicated to me that I’m gonna get hit.  It was as if I’m taking a stroll in a lumber yard.  But, the palette was all soft landing.  Black truffles, butterscotch, caramel.  No sign of that lumber yard.  Really well done.  Glad to have bought a bottle.  And “A”...to close it out...I wonder if her charades continued through her “ med school”, “residency”, and “attending”.   I should look her up..."

3.5,"Surprising herbal note kicks off the nose. Cinnamon and roasted corn. Shaving cream on the palate. Soft on the tongue considering the proof, but there's a heat, prickling sensation, that hits right in the middle between the sinuses and throat. Unique in that sense. Spice lingers for a looooong time.   4/26/19"

Caramel just gushes throughout.  Flavor is more doughy in comparison to the others. Peanut brittle and honeyed fruit notes.  Incredible intense and rich."

4.75,"The color is a rich amber with oil that quickly coats the glass. The nose spicy in a good way if you’re careful, with cinnamon, allspice, pepper, leather, rye, oak, vanilla and cooked brown sugar. The palate is dry but rich, with the spiciness being dominant, along with oak, sweet vanilla, brown sugar and caramel. The finish is long and spicy with lingering oak, vanilla and caramel that all keeps the mouth feeling hot and sweet for an eternity."
5.0,"Omg. I got lucky at a gig and the owner let me try a glass. It’s the smoothest bookers I’ve ever had. No bite at all. It tastes like the “Noe Secret” bottle but more vanilla, less fruit, and less bite. But wow is this good. I wish I could get my hands on this."

2.0,"Tasted this again over the weekend.  I wish I had some standout flavors to describe here.  Overall, I am still disappointed in this pour.  When you spend $200 retail on a bottle, you have a certain level of expectation.  The nose is still great, the flavor profile is still a typically average good bottle of Booker's.  The finish still ruins the whole experience.  It's dry, it's fast, it's flat, it's tart, and it's just not something you want to savor.  I tasted this SBS with the Backyard BBQ (2018-2) and it just did not prove to be worth the price.  If I'd paid the same price as a regular release, I probably wouldn't be as disappointed."
4.25,"Nose is sweet with peanut very little alcohol. Nose reminds me of a snickers bar. Taste is very hot with a good amount of oak. A little sweetness and vanilla balances it out some. Mouthfeel is nice and oily, finish lasts for days. Overall, happy I tried this and I really enjoyed it, but a tad hot for me. I probably would have liked this more if I had some distilled water, but the bar didn’t have any."

5.0,"I love bourbon, and this is the only time I have ever opened a bottle, smelled the pour, tasted the pour, and said, ""that's the best bourbon I've ever had"".  From front to back, it delivers on all fronts. The nose is wonderful, vanilla, cherries, oak.  The palate is solid, and the finish, oh man the finish.  Its that wonderful, sweet oak with full body but not the ethanol burn.  Even at the price point, this bourbon delivers fully."

3.5,"I suppose this is a review for me as this is gone and anyone paying secondary better want the box for their shelf as I'm just gonna say it now. I'm not sure it's worth 200 for the liquid, let alone secondary.

Nose - Brown sugar, perhaps some cherry or maybe it's just a varnish, oak, oak and more oak,. There's more here but I can't get past the alcohol. OK with water I'm getting rich heavy leather. More varnish. Vanilla but I'm not really getting caramel. 

Taste - So I'll leave out the opening. The mid pallet to finish are those peanuts you get at the steak houses with the shells and the oak from those barrels. The up front notes are hard to get, it's so high alcohol but it's sweet and has this shoe varnish. With water still intense, still kicks, still has that peanut and oak. The sweetness is more spread out and lasts longer. I need more water. The opening is non descriptive sweet bourbon notes, I can't get any more detailed. 

So I'm kinda torn here. it's darn good bourbon. I'm really a fan of oak and the peanuts and oak work well here. That said it's not that complex, it's not that nuanced, and it doesn't really have a lot of a transition. Just that sweet opening and then the rest. It's great but it's not special. 3.5 stars just because of the higher abv and it letting me really play with it. 

But hey the box is really cool and I hope that's worth a few hundered bucks for me cause I paid a bit too much for this. Leaving off the cost as I bought this from a good friend who sold it to me below secondary but it was still painful.  But hey he got to drink it with me as I opened it the second I gave him the cash and we had a nice couple of hours to catch up."

4.75,"A generous sample from dthom as part of the ""whiskey transfer program"".  Very excited to try this as I really like Booker's and Little Book.

Nose:  Very complex.  Right away I'm hit with caramel apples but there is a vanilla malty undertone almost like I'd expect from an Irish Whiskey.  Some funk in here too that reminds me of tropical fruit changing that initial apple in to more of a mango.  As it sits in the glass I start to get the signature Beam roasted peanuts with honey and dried figs.

Flavor: Caramel cream, boiled peanuts, vanilla, dark sugars, crème brulee.  Wow this is good!  Thick mouth feel and punches way under its weight for the proof.  

Finish:  Very long.  Starts off nutty and then quickly turns sweet/spicy and gets oaky but not very drying.  As it sits the spice fades in to a pleasant black pepper note with more toasted nuts and toasted coconut.

This stuff is delicious!   I could see paying MSRP of $200 for it but the secondary over $600 I'd have a hard time doing.  Definitely the best Booker's I've tasted and it should be.  Extra points for the cool packaging with the box being reclaimed wood from a rickhouse floor described as ""reclaimed wood that Booker Noe once walked on."""

4.75,"Damn. Another one that I almost wish wasn’t so good, given it’s complete lack of availability. The nose is full of intense, rich caramel, rye spice, roasted peanuts, and barrel char. There’s also a slight underlying note of stewed apples, and pralines. The palate is incredibly complex, opening into creme brûlée, espresso, honey roasted peanuts, dark chocolate, and the slightest hint of peanut butter cups. While quite oaky, the oaky tones are perfectly balanced, presenting as toasted sugars and black coffee, with the slight bitterness perfectly complementing the sweet sugared notes present throughout. There is a slight, but quite pleasant astringency rolling into a rich, nutty, toasty, caramel filled finish and a warm Kentucky hug. Truly phenomenal."

4.25,"Nose- Wet oak, Orange peel, buttered toffee, sweet caramel, molasses

Palate- sweetened vanilla, Caramel, heavy oak, chocolate muffin, sugar cookies

Finish- Long, DRY finish with notes of sweetness and wet oak

Really nice big hitting bourbon. Great balance of sweet notes with oak. Not too complex, but has a long finish that dries the mouth out and is overall quite enjoyable. A little too dry and a little overhyped in my opinion, but with the bottle design and its big bold flavors, this bottle is still a big win for me"

3.75,"I was fortunate enough to get a 2oz sample of this Bourbon with the specific purpose of comparing it head to head against my favorite Booker's batch (Bluegrass Batch 2016-01). I had previously had pours of the 30th edition and recall that it wasn't a significant upgrade if any at all over the superior batches. 

So what makes the 30th anniversary special? Well it's comprised both 16yr old and 9 yr old Booker's barrels. The average batch is just over 6 yrs old, so this is a significant step up in age. Let's dive into the tasting...

On the palate it big and rich with an initial note of oak which quickly recedes to rich butterscotch, pralines and tobacco. A fruit note in the background that I can't quite place. Mid palate adds pepper and some dark chocolate. Finish is long and oak driven. It's got incredible balance and is very easy to drink for the proof. My main point of contention is while it's got better balance and is more refined than the Bluegrass batch, I prefer the profile of the Bluegrass. 

In conclusion a great offering by Booker's but it's not a significant upgrade over some of the superior batches!

Cheers all!"
