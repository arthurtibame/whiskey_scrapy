4.0,"Heavy oak and char, slight vanilla and caramel. I found it very enjoyable at 99 proof. I usually find myself sticking to 110 and higher but this one held its own."
4.25,"""The Vaults"" is a new annual limited release from Widow Jane. A 20-barrel blend of 14+ year old straight bourbons from IN, KY, and TN, that were finished in  eight-year air-seasoned American oak casks. 500 cases released in 18 states.

Nose - dark brown sugar, oak, red delicious apples, tobacco, leather, cinnamon and cloves

Palate - brown sugar, sweet oak, semi sweet chocolate, vanilla, and baking spices. A hint of that earthy note I often get in well-aged MGP bourbons. 

Finish - the chocolate and sweet oak linger with some smoky charred notes and make for a nice finish. The baking spices are also there faintly (wish there was a bit more).

This is quite good, definitely more complex than the regular 10yr old product. Not exactly a value at the asking price though. I have a WJ 12-year MGP Single Barrel from a local store that's almost as good, and was considerably less expensive."

3.0,"Batch 1. Big nose, lots of fruit and sugar, it smells like Juicy Fruit gum. Some cinnamon and sandalwood as well. Very pleasant. On the palate, the nose carries over, with more cinnamon, which lingers throughout, sandalwood, and Juicy Fruit, but then it turns, finishing with some Cherry Coke and Dr. Pepper. It's almost like two different bourbons, you get a different one in the beginning and at the end. Fairly long, slightly bitter finish, like cacao or pecan nibs, and a bit of cough syrup. 1/20/20"
