5.0,"I love cask-strength whiskeys and this is one of my favorites!  The Patton Road Reserve is unique, and I mean that in the best way. I have Batch #1 and at 127-proof, this is an easy sipper that doesn't require water. The heirloom red corn provides a larger amount of starch which gives this whiskey a very unique, custard flavor, with brioche and toffee flavors. Then, the custard returns for a long finish. Rating on a Bottle, Bar or Bust scale, I absolutely say pick up the bottle! Cheers!"

5.0,"Batch No. 08, Bottle No. 212 - 59.9% Alc.
Exceptional full flavored sipping bourbon.  Nice warmth on the finish.  Easy to drink  despite the high proof.  Visited the Henry Farm for the tour and tasting.  Wonderful people.  They are focused on producing a quality product and in my opinion have succeeded.  Highly recommend!"
null,I want to try this one.

2.0,"When in Rome....or Wisconsin. Figured I'd pick up a bottle while in Wisconsin.  Meh. Heavy vanilla nose. Expected a hotter nose given the proof. Palate is grain heavy and vanilla, not surprising given the young age. Oily and sustained finish.  Way overpriced given all the other much better options out there."

5.0,"Nose is mild. Punchy, in-your-face bourbon you’d expect from a barrel proof. Mid palate is Maraschino cherries and almond. Finishes somewhat nutty, again almond or almost peanut. I’m a fan."
3.0,Good product but for the money there are better things out there

4.5,"This is an easy sipper that doesn't require water. Rich vanilla and light oak on the nose. Pretty subdued heat given the proof, which was unexpected. Taste is sweet with bits of creamy vanilla and toffee, the sweetness returns for a long nice finish."

4.25,"This is nice from a smaller producer.  It has brown sugar, oak and cherries on the nose.  The subtle fruit flavors and cognac shine through in sipping.  There is a slight alcohol astringency to this that I cannot place my finger on.  I like it and will buy more the next time I am in rural WI!"
