3.5,"Taste:  Neat in glen cairn, then 2 drops water

Nose:  (3.25) Cinnamon candies, marshmallows, and some citrusy notes.  I also got some creamed corn and ethanol.  Overall the nose had some good flavors to pull but a bit disjointed.  

Palate (3.75):  Traditional bourbon nose of vanilla and toffee initially.  Pepper develops on the rear palate.  Palate was interesting.  Flavors were well developed and better focused then the nose.  I was pleasantly surprised.

Finish (3.5):  Finished more like a scotch.  I found a little bit of hay, some lighter citrusy notes, and smoke.

Overall:  This bottle was a one off bottle exclusively destined to go to Chicago's Palmer House as a barrel pick.  mistakingly it ended up at my local Binny's, so I had to grab it.

I was surprised and pleasantly so.  I have heard this Wisconsin distillery has been hit or miss, especially with their young stuff.  I would say this one for me wasn't necessarily a hit, but it didn't miss its mark.  Pleasantly good flavors, but the orchestration kind of gets out of tune at times.  If it were an orchestra of flavors each musician would be very good on his own,  but at times, when they get together, one gets out of tune.  With some fine tuning this could be some beautiful music."
