3.0,"Mild and sweet peat. Creamy and soft with a bid of yellow fruit juice. 

The palate is still mild with the peat remaining soft but delicious. 

It is neat. Even though I can’t really put my finger on specific aspects, the combination makes this a pleasant and relaxing peated dram which is in between lightly and medium peated. A nice and not not overwhelming sipper."

A solid scotch but not overly complex. A good dram"
3.25,"This is the second bottle from Glenturret’s Peated NAS line:  Batch 2.  I originally reviewed the first batch, which was a U.K. Edition, a couple of months ago and found it rather lackluster.  This bottle sports a new label design and a wax-sealed neck.  This bottle ran $50 from an online shop out of London.

This batch was bottled at a slightly higher 43%, as opposed to the first edition which was just 40%.  It’s golden yellow in the taster and still sports some watery, thick legs and droplets in your Glencairn.  There is color added and I’m pretty sure it is chill filtered.

The nose on this one is slightly better- showcasing more earthy peat than bonfire smoke.  Roasted nuts and orchard fruits permeate the entire nosing and there’s really no need to let this one breathe longer than a couple of minutes.  There’s no extra complexity hidden inside and absolutely no need to add water.

The palate arrives with a nice dose of sweet, chewy smoke- but it’s unnecessarily buttery and a bit plastic-y.  There’s no harshness, but at the same time it isn’t exactly smooth.  It’s young stock and it shows- even at 43%.  The mid-palate feels oily and coats the tongue well after the finish.

Speaking of finish, there’s light citrus astringency right upon swallowing with a lightly toasted, oak barrel note that leads to an ultimately grainy finale.  It’s medium length with some salty dryness at the very end, like most typical mass produced, peated drams.

Overall, it’s much better than the 40% from the first batch and it’s a relative bargain at $50.  There’s nothing groundbreaking, but it does show promise should Glenturret ever decide to let the stuff age or blend in some older stock.  If you like experimenting with obscure distilleries and/or peated whisky give this one a go- it’s not hard on the wallet and a solid daily sipper.  3- 3.25 stars.  Cheers."

4.5,"A pleasant marriage of toffee, chocolate brownie, ginger spice and slightly salted with the BBQ smoke, this enhance the Glenturret malt experience we all enjoy. Long coffee finish. one of my personal favorites"
