1.0,"During my undergrad, my roommates would take the short drive over to Windsor. Before the era of passports or Canada cards to cross the border, Windsor was the proverbial ""land of milk and honey"" where a Freshman could get sloshed, gamble and find a cheap place to crash for the night. I never went. Something about the idea of hammering cheap vodka and huddling in my buddy's trunk to get through te border after losing my wallet sounds like 9 kinds of wrong. This whiskey feels the same. 

Stephanie is right about the see-saw between sweet and bitter that when drank straight makes you want to hurl, before being left with that stereotypical chest-hair growing bitter and burn at the end. But it does make a fair mixer if you want to spike a perfectly good Coca-Cola with a bit of the devil. I have it in my collection because a) it was only $3 after rebate, and b) everyone has that friend who can't respect a nice whiskey - this is for that friend."

2.5,"2.5 stars.  not good, but not bad either.  this is a very bland whiskey.  it starts if smooth, then that cheap whiskey flavor hits you very quick, and as quickly as that flavor hits it is gone and the Windsor finishes with a very mellow spice.  I'm actually very surprised Windsor tastes as good as it does given how cheap it is."

3.0,Not too bad for cheap whiskey
3.0,"Nose: The nose greets you as very friendly and sweet.

Taste: The palate is also sweet with a smoothness that was very appreciated as this was actually my first whisky experience.

Opinion: I really liked this whisky. It was smooth, no burn, and great paired with smoking a pipe on your porch with a friend. Cheers!"

0.5,"One of the foulest things I’ve had the misfortune of consuming. Very flavorless, outside of an artificial sweetness and overwhelming bitterness. Unfortunately, I have to give it .5 stars to separate it from whiskies that somehow manage to be worse"

4.25,"sabor muy neutro. regusto duro ahumado, vainilla y dulce"
4.5,"Windsor Canadian is amber, clear, and has some alcohol legs. The aroma is of grain alcohol, some added flavoring components, and rye, perhaps. The flavor is similar, and I think I detected some white rum additive. Mouthfeel is medium, and Windsor Canadian finishes moderately long. ""A-"" (90/100), for me. RJT"
3.0,Good mixing whiskey and that's about it. Nothing special but it's cheap and is one of the good ones for mixing. Not for sipping.
