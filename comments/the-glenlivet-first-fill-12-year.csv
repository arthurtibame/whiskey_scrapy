4.25,"The nose is light and dominated by flowers and vanilla. There are also sweet citrus, nuts, and caramel aromas. 

The nose doesn’t prepare you for the punch that the palate is about to deliver. The flavor really pops on the tongue and feel much more vivid than the standard Glen 12. 

This whiskey feels thick, almost chewy and is heavy with cream and vanilla flavors. You can also taste buttered biscuits, sweet citrus, and coconut. 

The finish is silky and lingers quite a bit. After the initial cream flavors on the palate the finish taste much spicier, with ginger and cinnamon. After the spice fades you’re left with a nice oak flavor on the tongue leaving you craving another sip. 

This scotch is nothing like the standard Glenlivet 12, it packs a lot more flavor into every sip and is a great value at under $40. In fact it might be my favorite scotch in the price range."
4.0,"One of Glenlivet's finest...good enough to carry a medium long finish.  Something all the Glenlivet's are lacking. 
A great Scotch to represent Speyside. The palate is fruity with 🍎,  🍐  with pepper on the back of the palate."

4.0,"A much more flavored expression of the 12yo, this one has been matured using first fill casks. The speyside character stays but makes a statement: ""im here and i am easy drinkable"".

On the nose it is not complex at all. It is very straightforward and that works fine. Honey, apples and cereal. Like having a honey corn flakes for breakfast. Nice, rewarding. 

On the palate the speyside profile continues. Apples and pears. Fresh fruit. Apple juice. Aftertaste is peppery with a little burnt oak. Oak spice.

To really describe this whisky i can only say that if i need to teach someone about whisky this might just be the perfect speysider example. Super fruity. 81 over 100. It is not expensive so go grab one."

4.0,"Fruity, vanilla, honey, and raw sugar on the nose; pleasantly sweet. If you were ever to smoke a fruit basket, this is what it would smell like. Raspberry and floral taste with a hint of smoke on the palate. Great value! 8/10"

3.25,"It was a sweet glenlivet, well balanced. But it felt like it was missing something, not as complex as I would of liked. For the price you couldn’t beat it though."
3.0,The vibe is vanilla and campfire. Campfire sold separately.
4.25,"Nose - Poached pears, pineapple, caramel, vanilla, light cinnamon, hint of orange zest

Taste - Vanilla, caramel, pineapple, light cinnamon, poached pears, coconut milk creaminess, orange zest very briefly at the front of the palate

Finish - Lingering velvety cinnamon vanilla caramel, light bitterness but pleasant, sweet orange immediately after the initial swallow

Score - 85/100

Final Thoughts - This was surprisingly good and I don't think I would've pegged it as a Glenlivet if tasted blind. This doesn't really have that much of the classic fresh apple/pear that I typically get from most Glenlivets. This was a completely different beast in a good way. I think I prefer this over the standard 12 as this seems to have a slightly darker, more caramel notes that I typically get with older Scotches (although it could be the slightly higher proof talking). I could see this being a great intro Scotch for some people as well as being a great budget mixer as well.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - Yes"

3.25,Honey and vanilla on the nose with a bit of spice. Definite alcohol on the nose and the palate. I got a hint of sweet honey at the beginning then strong alcohol. Not my favorite Glenlivet overall.
3.75,"Bright flavor, sweet with a good balance.  Way better than the standard 12 year."
