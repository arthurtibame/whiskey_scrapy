3.5,"I'm really trying to like this one. The label says it is an exclusive bottling for the Willow Park liquor store in Calgary, AB. The cask strength of 66% is giving me a little difficulty. If the sip is too small it evaporates in your mouth leaving nothing and if the sip is too big I have to cough out the burn and miss the flavours. Every now and then I get the perfect amount and get a wonderful mouthful of vanilla oak and sherry that goes down smooth. Like I said I want to like it, I am just not used to a temperamental sipper like this. it has Regular price of $110 CAD."
