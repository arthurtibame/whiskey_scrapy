4.25,"NOSE: This is super smoky. Ardbeg levels from Speyside. There’s a thick sweet date and plum scent. Wet leaves provide funk. Heavy heavy nose.

PALATE: It’s less of an uppercut than the nose, but delivers dry, sweet fruit and mellow spice. The finish is strong again. Dry, salty, then cigar fumes and dey leaves.

OVERALL: I had this in a blind tasting amongst 18-year heavyweights, and it came out swinging. Probably the most heavy, full-bodied whisky I’ve tried."
