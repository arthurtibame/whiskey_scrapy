3.25,"That brandy barrel finish really ties this one together. Its still a Canadian whisky, so there’s that. But this is definitely darker, richer than the standard stuff."
4.25,"Smooth 
Clean finish"
3.5,Very smooth.  Not bad but could have more flavor.
1.75,"Following my review for the standard Pendleton comes this review for Pendleton Midnight Canadian Whisky.  It's mostly the same juice except a portion of the whisky was aged in brandy barrels.  Let's see if it fairs any better.

Nose: Like its predecessor, still too much of the sweet solvents, though not to the degree you might expect since the ABV is bumped up to 45% here.  It's more fruity.  Starfruit (never gotten that note in a whisk(e)y before) and musty bubblegum.  Still too much alcohol burn.  

Palate: Light-bodied, with a slightly more classy variety of cloying, artificial sweetness.  Non-descript fruitiness, vanilla, and spice.  

Finish:  Short but once again, that familiar, unpleasant aftertaste lingers for too long.  Bitter, vanilla-grape cough syrup with some green pepper.  

Verdict:  This is another ""no"" from me.  While slightly more tolerable than the standard issue, this is still not good and the aftertaste is really off-putting to me.  

1.75 ~ Poor"

2.5,"Alcohol is too dominant on the nose, I can't get a bead on what else there is. There's pepper throughout but it's not dominating. Hint of light maple syrup. Not a bad drink but nothing special or memorable."
