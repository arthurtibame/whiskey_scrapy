5.0,"Oh wow, so this is what bourbon should be. Very very complex and well made. I got to say that when i first nosed it, i thought ""here goes another 3.25 whiskey"", and i didn't even pour that much on the glass for that reason. 

After the whole experience, i was so glad i bought a full bottle of this and i will fully describe every step of what i did to really enjoy this dram. 

Bottled at 47%abv, with an auburn, polished mahogany color. First of all, when pouring this dram into the glencairn, there is a strong alcohol note on the nose, and the typical grape bourbon profile.
Nevertheless i stuck my nose there, surviving the alcohol note, i found: chocolate bathed raisins, wine grapes like cabernet sauvignon, and vanilla cream. For some reason, i decided to let the dram rest for 10 minutes. 

BEST DECISION EVER! After letting the dram rest, all alcohol notes were gone, and it opened up to release nosing notes such as: Lime, Christmas Cake, more vanilla cream, slight stinky peat, more grapes, and i nosed it for a long time without even sipping it, at some point i was addicted to the aroma. 

On the palate was perfectly balanced, and didn't resemble to any othe bourbon, it was more like scotch. Flavors were coming in a certain order that was easily identifiable, and i started writing them down as they appeared in the proper order: 1.- orange syrup, orange caramel syrup. 2.- wood, oak. 3.- ashes. 4.- A spicy, ashy burn. Pleasant, like a treatment for stress, beatiful. Brown sugar taste is also present at the finish. 

Full bodied, long lasting finish. It was a 5.0 already but i decided to add a drop of water just to see what happens. After doing it: on the nose: Vanilla cream, Christmas Cake with candied fruits. On the palate: black pepper and vanilla cake. Overall is 98 over 100, and that is because you have to let it rest because of the alcohol note. Fantastic dram. Best bourbon i have had, a jewel to taste and enjoy. Cheers!"
