5.0,Very oaky upon opening - mellows and settles down with time. Remains oaky but the way you want it. Let it breathe and it will please!

null,"**UPDATE: Allowing my opened bottle to sit with a little extra oxygen has helped to make this an enjoyable pour.  I still regret spending so much (retail) per bottle but it is still a special bottle to have in my collection.  When you pour, let it breathe before you drink.
  
[Tasting from my 1990, so far this has been a disappointment for my palate. I'm saving an unopened 1990 & 1991 to hopefully trade later down the road because of the rarity.  Personally, 24 years is too much time for bourbon.  My sweet spot is typically anywhere in the 12-15 year range. Sometimes I even prefer a 7 year when they are high rye.]"

4.0,"Amazing nose, maybe the finest mesmerizing nose in bourbon for me thus far. 
mouth feel is full
 The age is apparent based on complexity and smoothness- it has both. You know that much of the “bullshit” evaporate out of this mix years ago. 

Flavors are mint, clove, oak, vanilla, cinnamon, with a mild Carmel finish. 

The heat on the finish is about a 5. 

Try it based on its uniqueness, however- paying $200+ for a bottle seems a bit silly-  there are plenty of lower priced options that perform nicely (belle Meade single barrel, weller 12, EC barrel proof, crown rye)

Oh, and by the way- all of you online secondary Market price gougers and pappy counterfeiters can kiss my ass.😘"

4.25,"Rich, coats the mouth, full-flavored and peaks with a sweet medicinal-like smokey honey that slowly fades and lingers. Delicious and quite unique."
4.5,Oak bomb of glory
4.25,Maybe over-oaked but still tasty. Better than the orange one for sure. But still not Pappy 23.
3.75,"The nose is intense with freshly cut wood, spearmint, some allspice and leather. It is a very intriguing nose that gives a lot of curiosity to the palate. As it breathes, it opens up and becomes quite an alluring smell. The palate is very woody, but in a pleasant way. Behind it is black pepper, cinnamon and a touch of cherry. The finish is medium, not nearly as long as you might expect. There is fading oak and vanilla, with the pepper and spices fading quickly. As it breathes even more, the whole experience mellows further. Interesting sipper, but lacking depth."
3.0,"expected it to be smoother for 24 yrs
very DRY finish"

4.75,"BarChef - Toronto.
Nose slightly brighter than expected.  Some barnyard to go with the leather and oak.

Flavor of brown butter and toffee was consistent end to end over 2 oz.  age was apparent, without the dryness and chalkiness that accompanies some older bourbon (ehhh...hmmm...Elijah Craig).

Palate lingered with butter and sesame oil.  One pour of this could last for hours."
