4.0,"A bit uninpressed, this rather rare expression of Glenmorangie (maybe its just my perception) is finished in ""sweet french wine casks"" for a sweeter profile. Lets see if that is true.

Bottled at 43%abv

On the nose: for a 43%abv it is a very light whisky. Chocolate, varnish, paint, acetone, orange, honey, red fruits.

On the palate is very sweet. Strawberry, spicy pepper, chocolate and almonds. Aftertaste has a dim note of burnt hay and clove.

Overall this whisky delivers the promise of been sweet, but lacks character and is a little boring. Dont get me wrong, there is nothing off putting here, it is just nothing to die for. 85 over 100."

4.0,"Great travel retail exclusive, and I recommend trying. 

Aromas of honey and cooked dates. It's sweet to the palate, with almond paste, ginger and wood spice on the finish.

Thoroughly enjoyed it."
3.5,"No 3. On DF tasting list. Not a stand out on the day. By this stage I was well into chatting to the guy about dramfest, a Glendronach single cask tasting he did earlier in the week and so I was just registering a score. Middle of the road. Preferred less than the Tayne."
