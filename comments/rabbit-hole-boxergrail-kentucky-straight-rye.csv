3.5,"Wood and leather followed by very slight licorice and vanilla. This is a smooth whiskey to be sure, but Rabbitgrail Boxerhole might have gone too far because I'm not finding the rye spice character too easily."

4.25,"Smooth mouthfeel, buttery. Mild citrus flavors with light spice on the finish."
4.0,Extremely buttery mouthfeel. Medium oak and plenty of flavor. Not overly spicy for 95% rye.

4.5,Looks like I got an older label with a 3 year age statement on back..... I’ll just say it’s a damn good rye whisky!  Going back for another bottle.
