5.0,"This is a pretty solid flagship bourbon. It's pretty tasty, kind of like Eagle Rare. No fire, pretty smooth with caramel notes. Not sure why the reviews on here are so low, this is much better than I was expecting from a young distillery in VA. Really a 3.75, giving it a 5 to offset silly low reviews."
