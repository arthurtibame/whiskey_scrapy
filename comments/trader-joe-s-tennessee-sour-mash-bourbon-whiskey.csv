1.0,Too young and woody. Too weak to load up with ice. This is no bargain.
1.0,"It’s not gross, it’s just young, raw and spirity. Aroma is muted, light and spirity and a tad woody – it’s not well integrated and comes through quite raw; Palate, like the aroma. is just light, raw and reminds me quite a bit of the California Clear White Whiskey; Finish is done in a flash leaving mere traces of raw corn."
2.0,"Medicinal, rubbing alcohol. Finish is short lived - thank god. Maybe Good for a cocktail, maybe..."
