5.0,"SB4 New #4 Char, Bottle 6 of 105, aged 2 years, 110.7 proof

Nose: snickers bar, caramel, nuts

Burn is on the back end with no bite up front. Earthy, peat moss, caramel, butterscotch. Has the taste of a Clif Bar. At $65 this is a fantastic and interesting single barrel bourbon. For only being aged 2 years, it has depth and is pretty smooth."

1.0,Batch 49 is nothing like the review for Batch 01. Behind the heat is too much oak and leather for me.

1.0,"NOSE... Pistachios and herbs

FLAVOR is sweet, rich with mint and other herbal and floral highlights. While it's herbal it's not full of richness, and doesn't have a lasting finish, especially for having a higher proof. Has an almost tobacco type of nature to it's flavor, like I'm doing a chew or dip.

COLOR is akin to a copper penny

OVERALL it's just ok to me. Like an herbal gin that could have used more time in the barrel. If I were more into Scotch I'd likely be a bit more drawn to this but unfortunately I'm just not. Wouldn't buy it again, nor could I recommend it.



........ trying it again and well, it's still a whiskey that tastes every bit as immature as it's 2 year old supposed age statement. I'm obviously not privy to the actual age but it's tasting every bit as young as I've heard mentioned. Just not good, reminds of all the whiskey or bourbon I've tried that's aged at warp speed.."

4.0,"Corn, hay, browned butter and flour batter on the nose. Sweet woodiness and some hay on the flavor profile with a reasonably creamy mouthfeel. Definitely has some heat to it. 4.12."

3.0,Vanilla butterscotch cherries toasted corn
3.5,"Hot. Lots of rye in the mash bill. Starts like a normal bourbon  vanilla, caramel, etc. Ends with medicinal cherry and pipe tobacco (maybe). Corn funk lingers on the pallet forever"
4.75,Sip very slowly. Intense. Full

1.0,Corn dominates. This stuff is way too young as the label indicates (2 years).

3.75,Very unique bold flavor. Very corn and vanilla forward. The spice and strength is very noticeable even with an ice cube. Not my all time favorite but appreciate the differences from the stereotypical bourbon.
