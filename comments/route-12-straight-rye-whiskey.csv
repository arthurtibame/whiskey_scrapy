2.0,"As a rye novice, I’d classify this as a quintessential rye whiskey. And by that I mean: not a huge fan, and I may be drinking pickle juice with food coloring in it.

There’s a strong industrial flavor from nose to finish. It’s similar to the Journeyman portfolio in that way. Possibly cedar? Other than that I get a paint thinner nose, body has a hint of—nope, never mind, it’s straight pickles. If you have in iPhone, open up messages and do an image search. Type in “hotdog face”. The one with the girl being hit in the face by a bunch of hotdogs? Yeah replace her face with mine and the hotdogs with pickles. That’s the finish."
