3.5,"Nose: sweet and fruity, apple, creme brûlée, nuttty like pecan, earthy.
Taste: oak, toffee, punch of citrus as it fades
Far superior to the Elgin Classic. Worth paying a little more for this 12yr."
4.0,"Light, smooth, vanilla, short nose"
3.25,"Nose: Light, sweet and floral.
Palate: The same theme from the nose continues on the palate. This whisky has a nice light honeyed cereal flavour that is very approachable and pleasant on the tongue. Not a whole lot of complexity here but nothing off putting either. 
Finish: Medium length, faint canned peach sweetness.

Honestly considering the price there is nothing wrong with this Speyside whisky if you're looking for some light easy drinking. However for roughly the same price I'd take an Aberfeldy 12 or Glenfiddich 12 over this 12 year old Glen Moray."
3.75,Tasty for the price point. Sweet and smooth.

2.5,Another in the perfectly average category for me. Floral and citrus on the nose with the barest hint of earthy. Fruit I can’t place and toffee up front with a strong oak finish. Standard alcohol burn.

3.0,Nothing to distinguish.
3.0,"Nose : Vanilla stands out, followed by floral and fruity (especially plum) elements.

Taste : Pretty classic. Mellow, a bit of fruit and spice.

Finish : Quite alcoholy, with a bit of vanilla. Disappointing finish.

Not bad for an entry-level scotch, but there is much better fir the same price."

2.75,"Light and fruity with a bit of dry finish.  A little earthy but in a good way.  Hints of honey and pear with a touch of floral notes.  Not super complex, but a verry dice drink. Pairs great with my lime vape, now to try it with a Punch Classico Elite (cuban cigar)"
