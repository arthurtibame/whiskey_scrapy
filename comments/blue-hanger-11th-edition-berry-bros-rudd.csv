5.0,Delicious. Trying for first time at AandC’s. Also trying a Rancore’s Toothpick because my bro in law Caution just rolls like that.
3.5,"I have to give a shout out to the good folks at whiskey galore whiskey retailer in Christchurch, NZ. They are responsible for many of my favourite life experiences from setting up the Last Word bar which I have spent a fortune over the last several months here flying down weekly. Also for running the best festival in the world..Dramfest every two years :-). I've bought a few things off them online over the years but never actually visited their shop in person.  I popped in to get a glass hand blown whiskey water dropper (no longer will I be straining to carefully get the right amount of water out of the tap!) and before I know it they were offering me a sample of this.  As I said good people! The speaker of our parliament here popped is as well for a tasting so looks like well connected also! Anyway the drop itself was nice, creamy honey creme brulee type thing, alcohol wasn't to in balance. I don't know if its a fair rating as I spent the day drinking wine in vineyards in the Waipara region the day before, and previous two nights at the last word bar so really didn't feel like drinking, but 3.5 I'm thinking."
