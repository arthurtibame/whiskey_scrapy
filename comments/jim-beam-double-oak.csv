4.0,"I picked up a bottle of this and was pleasantly surprised. After seeing it on the shelf at the liquor store, and seeing it's very affordable price, I decided to take a risk. I've never had Jim Beam before, but this was certainly a good place to start. The nose was beautifully sweet and woody while the palate opened up a bit more caramel and brought even more oak than the aroma did. The finish was medium length, light and slightly spicy but eventually developed into a very pleasant honey aftertaste that left me wanting another sip. Four out of five stars in general, but five out of five for the price range."

4.0,"Very enjoyable JB with a wonderful nose of oak (no surprise), vanilla, caramel and would have to agree with other reviews of pipe tobacco. Nose and legs linger forever. Taste is on par with the nose with a medium spicy oaky finish and a nice amount of heat on the back end. A few drops of water really opens this whisky up making the aforementioned notes even more pronounced. Nicely done, well priced and a good change of pace for those who like me, drink more of robust, spicier whisky but still has enough body and bravado to keep it interesting and enjoyable."

4.0,"Nose is smoky, oakey, cinnamon and burnt sugar. Palate is smooth oak, burned wood, brown sugar and sawdust. With a splash of water, the sweetness is more pronounced, gets smoother and showcases the vanilla and butterscotch flavors.

Finish is smooth with a little kiss of heat( from the 86 proof) and notes of caramel and vanilla. Very well done and half the price of the Woodford Reserve Double Oaked ($25)."

4.0,"This is good. Best Beam I've tried to date (and when I say that, I mean something that actually says BEAM on the bottle). Light caramel in color with a great nose of barrel oak with honey, vanilla, varnish and a hint of leather. A splash or cube of ice brings dried fruit and pipe tobacco to the mix. Neat you get big oak backed by caramel corn, vanilla and brown sugar. All the traditional bourbon notes take a backseat to the barrel. A tad thin, but not overly so. It finishes with a drying oak astringency. A slightly sweet vanilla mint lingers on the palate (think an MGP 95 rye). Add a cube of ice and the sweet notes assert themselves a little more strongly on both the palate and the finish. While not a traditional bourbon profile, it was very enjoyable. Gets an extra star for the under $30 price tag."

2.0,"Well well well, it appears I’ve reached the 200 review milestone here on Distiller.  I wonder what perks I’ve unlocked.  Nothing, @Distiller?  Fair enough.

So, I keep looking through Jim Beam’s product line for variations to my bourbon and Coke cocktails that I enjoy when I’m not sipping on single malt scotches.  I normally just buy a half gallon of the standard White Label, but I’ve recently been experimenting a bit with the Bonded (100 proof) and now this Double Oak.  I need to give the Distiller’s Cut a go soon before I truly decide if a change from the standard is in order.

The Double Oak is 86 proof and advertises being normally aged in charred, white oak barrels and then being transferred to freshly charred oak for a second maturation.  I’m not sure of the lengths of time for either maturation and I’m actually not all that interested in doing the work to try to find out.  Needless to say, this bottle doesn’t work for me as a cocktail.  It’s too “woody” to play well with Coca Cola.  I went ahead and did a dram neat so I can see what’s what.  This is a review of that dram.

The nose is wood and char with quite a bit of spiced vanilla.  The palate is smooth enough but there’s just too much oak to even make it enjoyable as a sipper.  The finish is still kind of short and, dare I say, boring.  I wouldn’t want to drink this on a regular basis and I even poured the last couple of drams down the drain.  For the record- I wasn’t a fan of the Woodford Reserve Double Oaked whiskey, either.  I guess it’s just too too much.

It doesn’t play well with Coke.  The heavy oak presence feels artificial and the only way to calm it is to add more cola.  I normally like to add a splash just to enhance the bourbon but this can’t be accomplished without turning this into a overly sweet mess of a drink.

So, in conclusion, it’s a no as a neat sipper and a no as a mixer.  I think I have to get a bottle of Distiller’s Cut and give it a go or just declare the Bonded as the winner.  This is one I would avoid.  I hate giving it a bad score because I love Jim Beam, but this one isn’t worth the price to play.  2 stars, if I must.  Cheers."

3.0,"To be honest, I have a hard time differentiating all of the Beam products (white label, black label, etc.).  Double Oak seems like it fills the exact same niche as Devil's Cut, albeit it gets there via a different aging technique.  As expected, this bourbon is woody as hell.  That's the dominant scent on the nose, along with a little caramel sweetness, and a slightly bitter oak is the main feature of the palate and finish as well.  This bottle actually is hard to distinguish from Devil's Cut, which arguably has more pleasant wood flavors but a little less sweetness, and sells at a similar price point right around $20.  Take two Andrew Jacksons, buy both, and decide which you like better, then make that your go-to bottom-shelf bourbon."

2.0,"Sweetness is there, on the nose, alongside a strong alcohol smell, and charred oak, and some vanilla. You could tell this is going to be harsh. Indeed, the nose does not deceive; fire on the palate, paired with blunt oak and an indistinct sweetness. Burnt almonds, maybe. Burns all the way down, very spicy finish, mouth-numbing. This is no sipper. Pair with Coke or soda, if you're into that kind of thing."

Nose:  vanilla, spice, sawdust, and alcohol. 

Palate:  sweet on the front end with barrel char and light spice.  Mid-palate a little bitter from the barrel char.  Nice mouthfeel.

Finish:  slightly bitter and hot.  Fairly short.  

Conclusion:  This isn’t one I’d sip neat, but it might work well mixed. I can muster 3 stars."
3.0,Loved the smoky ness of this. Not as harsh as I was expecting. For the price not bad.
2.0,"This one almost didn’t make the top shelf.  It is harsh and not very good neat.  But when it is on the rocks the flavor really comes out:  sweet, vanilla, and just enough spiciness to be interesting.  Only good on the rocks or in a mixed drink.  Very inexpensive ("

3.25,"Jim Beam Double Oak is one of two expressions from the Beam distillery with the goal of enhancing the oaky wood qualities in their bourbons, the other being Devil's Cut.  Double Oak takes standard Beam juice and simply ages it again in a second newly charred oak barrel for an unstated period of time, but likely less than 1 year by my guess.

Enjoyed neat from a Glencairn. The short of it is standard JB profile with just a bit of extra oak and smokey char flavor.  I like more oak forward flavors so this is enjoyable and cheap for a double oak, compared to something like Woodford DO.  Nose is sweet corn with caramel toffee .  Palate is sweet with more caramel vanilla and slightly more noticeable oak and char flavors.  Pretty smooth neat sipper with easy heat and spice.  Finish is sweet caramel and barely augmented by the extra oak, not an oak bomb by any means.  A nice pleasant minty menthol lingers long into the finish with an enhanced char smokiness. In comparison to Beam's other ""woody"" bourbon, Devil's Cut, I find DO to be sweeter with more caramel flavors, and in particular an enhanced smoky char back note; whereas DC is far more astringent oak tannin driven with more wood barrel and less smoky char.  

Overall for the price a decent ""extra oaked"" bourbon.  If you like slightly more oak forward flavors give this a try.  It's not at all complex or even that interesting, but the extra oak on top of traditional JB bourbon flavors is nice if that's what you like.  Compared to Devil's Cut, the DO is sweeter more caramelized with a more smoky undertone, while DC is more astringent oak tannin forward and less smoke.

Part of me thinks the Double Oak naming here is more gimmick than what it really delivers, and I suspect it's because the overall length of aging just isn't long enough to impart more robust oak flavor, and the time spent in the second barrel is far to short to really matter.  I honestly get stronger and better quality oak flavors out of other bourbons in the same price class, namely the delicious Wild Turkey 101 and even Bulleit, although bear in mind the overall flavor profile of these is unique and vastly different than JB.   It's not that JB DO is a bad bourbon, but for a double oak I expect stronger more intense oak flavor, and this tastes like any traditional caramel vanilla forward JB bourbon really.  If you truly want amped up oak with amped up traditional bourbon flavor in a JB product, you'll need to step up to Knob Creek, especially the SiB which is truly exceptional.  Cheers!"

3.0,"Appearance: The color of this rugged bourbon was a dark caramel orange and its legs, after a quick swirl around the glass, were thin and watery.

Nose: On the nose I got notes of campfire smoke, caramel candy, a Jim Beam signature peanutiness, a very light banana that got bigger as time went on, and a note of Nilla Wafers. Overall, quite a delicious bouquet in my opinion!

Taste: The palate possessed notes of smoke and BBQ char; that extra smokiness from the second barrel made me think of peated scotch. There was also a heavy oak bite and a salted peanuts note.

Finish: The finish was long and clingy with a lingering ashy taste and mouthfeel like I just finished smoking a pipe.

Thoughts: It seems this bourbon is a hit or miss for people; you either like it or you don't. Personally, I like it! I think it's good, kinda harsh if it's not what's expected but it could be thought of as an Islay of bourbon, or a cheap and decent gateway from bourbon into smokey scotch. I'd recommend at least trying this and personally wouldn't mind buying it again. Thanks, Beam! Cheers!"

Young oak, caramel sweetness and some fruits to the nose. The taste is perfectly balanced. A bit simple but in right proportions. Not sharp at all but might be tough or engrossing (in sense of taste) to a newcomer (Buffalo Trace and Bulleit are more pleasant).
Mouthfilling, viscous and very light, so it’s enjoyable to make big sips.
Some rye, caramel, spicyness. It is like what would happen if we take all the good bourbons together and then take the average.
Finish might be called a disappointment. It is somewhat harsh with clear spirit notes. a bit long so it makes it “disturbing”."

3.25,"Unfortunately a week after I bought this I bought a Woodford Reserve Double Oaked Single Barrel store pick, so my review is tainted by the discrepancy between the two. The clear benefit of Jim Beam Double Oak is its affordability and uniqueness compared to what you'll find in bourbons under $30. However, this bottle that is half of the price of the Woodford Reserve also packs roughly half of the flavor. For an 86 proof bourbon the nose is particularly strong, mostly due to the heavy oak influence. Other than oak I get a charred, dusty corn. The vanilla or toffee sweetness some note is absent for me. 

Overall the oak in this bourbon is astringent, young, or artificial, depending on what adjectives you want to use, both on the nose and taste. Unlike the Woodford Reserve and a few other double matured whiskeys, this does not have a rich, complex body that works in unison. There are hot sauces and barbecue sauces that add artificial heat or smoke in lieu of real ingredients to save on cost. I think of that same process with this bourbon, it tastes like artificial oak flavoring instead of the real deal. I know that's most likely not true, but what it signifies is probably a short second maturation with heavily charred barrels to increase production and save on time. I'm not saying this is a bad bourbon, but I prefer other Jim Beam products."

Decided to try to get back into it with one of the ubiquitous Jim Beam expressions out there, Double Oak. This is the standard Beam, aged in virgin oak barrels of course, but then it is finished in fresh virgin oak. Bottled at 43% ABV, chill filtered and natural color of burnt orange.

The nose starts with stale, dusty peanuts, sharp oak and vanilla. Peanut brittle, toffee, graham crackers, gingerbread, rye spice, mint and a touch of dill. It’s also slightly fruity with grape jelly, chocolate oranges, baked apples, cherry cough syrup and raspberries. Cinnamon, toasted marshmallows, candy corn and some barrel char. The nose is sort of all over the place, but never strays too far from the peanut notes. 

The palate is musty oak, rye, peanuts, peanut brittle and vanilla. Red berries, apple skins and orange peel as far as any fruitiness goes. Barrel char and some roasted corn. Not deep at all, but a decent base of flavors. 

A medium bodied mouthfeel that is a bit thin and tongue coating. 
The finish is medium short, oak, vanilla, peanuts and rye. 

Not a bad bourbon, but not that good either. Until the bottle was good and oxidized (about 80% gone), everything felt stale and musty. Seems like a bourbon engineered to appeal to a large consumer base and offend very few. I won’t say that it appealed to me, nor will I say that it offended me, but I won’t be buying it again as the Extra Aged version is superior to this for the same price of around $25. A solid 3. 
Cheers"

Nose - Not much, a bit of spice

4.25,"Lots of smoke flavor, but not enough to overwhelm you. It doesn't quite achieve the wood level that other bourbons do with double oaking, but instead transforms Jim Beam into any other number of top shelf bourbons that achieve a full barrel flavor with only the one go through the barrel. For the cost, this is probably a permanent staple of the bar."

3.0,"Nose:  Dusty peanut shells, sweet burnt toffee/peanut brittle, brown-vanilla sugars.  Bits of sweet ripe fruits. Very much a ""Beam"" nose and really, what I want and expect from an average Jim Beam product.  This 86 proofer leaves a nice oily film on the glencairn.

Front: Bursting dank sugars and wood immediately present following with the sweet fruit, ginger spices and nuts, the higher cut proof flavor carries forward and separates itself from mild, white label Beam.  

Finish: light and quick fading with hints of the sugared woods holding on to the end, not a ton of variety of flavor notes but certainly what it takes to signal ""this is real Kentucky bourbon"".

Much like the Distillers Cut and the Bonded Beams', this one has the ""guts"" of what I want in a bourbon,  and unlike the watered down standards of 80 proof from the usual distilleries including Beam, this much nicer offering gives me the satisfaction of actually ""tying into"" a nice drink.   Like walking into any average bar, asking for a bourbon and being surprised  you actually got something satisfying without making  a label call, the Double Oak just offers up more .   

While you would never confuse this with a Woodford extra barrelled offering or a Makers special oak stave project, this is a clear upgrade to white and black label Beam and at a price that may go sub 20$ in some regions,  you won't find many bottles to compete with it.   This is a great bourbon to have on hand if you just want to have a quick decent straight belt and if your buddy has to slosh a barrel of coke in it for himself, won't cause you to grimace(too much). 

A nice bottle from Beam that flys under the radar just waiting for you to pick it up."

3.75,"If you are considering buying this, I assume that oak is one of your driving tastes. Oak is definitely present in this bourbon although there is a slight hint of 
vanilla. This bourbon is smooth and easy to drink. If you appreciate oak and vanilla qualities in a bourbon, than this is a great budget bourbon for you."
3.25,"Had it among 9 other whiskey’s (including 6 Bourbons) in a blind tasting night and it was easily the worst bourbon. Star rating is a bit generous. Below 3-stars is what I consider undrinkable, and I haven’t had, but 1 or 2 whiskey’s hit that mark in my life. Will add that it’s hard distinguishing taste between 10 different whiskeys this may be a bit harsh"
