2.0,"Peppery, herbal, medicinal. Not a ton of experience with ryes, so I don’t have a lot to compare this to."

2.0,"spice and grass nose, a little sour then spice and ethanol on the tongue and then GONE with saccrine aftertaste. really awkward, maybe because the 100% rye mashbill got away from them."

1.0,"This is not your typical rye, it’s almost like a dessert wine or dessert whisky and not in a good way. The toffee notes hit you immediately, but taste like they came from the bottom of a trash can. This lacks the typical spice profile found in good rye whisky."

4.25,"Notes for the 2 year old, 100% Rye, Straight American Rye Whiskey, non chill-filtered, small batch, #44. Nose: pencil shavings, dill, cumin, paprika, black pepper. Palate: dill, cumin on the entry, cinnamon and toasted grainy rye in the middle, heather, kitchen sage and salt, with barrel spice and hints of chocolate on the very long finish. 4 tier flavor development, when palated correctly. Certainly an acquired taste, (the pencil shavings and dill are very dominant on the nose, and will get a reaction for sure!) but a unique and enjoyable experience, IMHO. The palate is much more balanced than the nose, with cinnamon being the most distinct note. Needs time to open up, seemingly no body at first, but that really is not the case once it's been breathed properly. Big body for a two year old, luxurious mouth-feel, neither tannic nor oily. The clean Cascade water is a sterling canvas for the oil that is the flavor profile. High quality, but very much an acquired taste...youngest and most unique whiskey I've ever had. Given the age, I'd like to see this at $20-$25 instead of $30 here in Bend, Oregon. Non-biased review. Recommend you try a shot first before buying a bottle, I'd say this could be considered the pungent and strong Islay of Ryes. Huge points for complexity, clarity of notes, and very long finish."
