3.0,"Not terribly special neat, although it was my first rye so I didn't know what to expect. A light spice on the palate. If you must mix whiskey, this is fantastic in coke. It retains plenty of flavor if you're not trying to drown it."

2.0,As some have mentioned this my first Rye.  I find it to be a very lite easy drinker. The start is similar to Jamason but the finish and after taste spicy and full flavorful.

3.0,"Nose: Cherry, caramelized banana, nutmeg, white chocolate
Palate: Vanilla, cinnamon, red apples
Finish: Black pepper, cherry

It's very smooth and doesn't linger very long after taking a sip, it kind of fades into the background rather quickly. It's a good beginner rye and probably best utilized when mixing cocktails."

1.0,"Nose: Some spices - nutmeg, white pepper, cloves. Very simple and one dimensional.

Plate: Bland. More caramel and bourbon-like than any other rye I've tasted, but very low key.

Finish: Barely any at all - the palate just dwindles quickly.

The least impressive rye I've tasted - it seems to be diluted to the point where all character has vanished.

""Inferior"" : 1 star"

4.0,"Spicy!  Caveat:  this review is with ice. I had this at a local watering hole on the rocks. 

Nose: vanilla, overripe bananas, and rye spice. 

Palate: spice at the beginning, followed by earthiness/wet soil mid-palate (in a good way), accompanied by more spice. 

Finish: dry and spicy with a bitter, rye bread note. The mid-palate, finish, and aftertaste all have a thread of dark chocolate running through them. 

I liked this a lot - maybe it was the good company and the fact that we were celebrating. Perhaps I will try again neat and in a place where I can be more objective. It didn't seem like a $20 USD bottle of rye whisky. I agree with the expert rating and give it 86 points for four stars, factoring in price/value."
