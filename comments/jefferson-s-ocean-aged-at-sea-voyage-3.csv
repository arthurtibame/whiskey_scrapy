2.0,"I like bourbon, I don't like cruises - as it turns out I don't like bourbon that has been on a cruise(voyage). I presume Jeffersons thought this marketing ploy up, over a bottle or two of their own grog. The same grog that was then packed off round the world, then bottled at a premium. This experiment in my humble opinion, was a waste of time. The liquor inside the bottle tastes like bourbon that has been filtered through a salted sieve. I presume Jeffersons did not send ""their"" finest  bourbon on this trip and that is bad, as it renders this  seemingly young  thin whiskey a novelty. Doing something because you can, is not the same as doing something because you should. Mal Voyage"

Cherries on the arrival, fairly bright on a soft and silky body.  The cherry notes give way to a nutty and autumnal spices; nutmeg, cinnamon.  Finishes with a the same spices and some oak tannins.  A cube or small amount of water increases the cherry and vanilla notes, morphing more towards brown sugar.   A warming whiskey that is suited well for a crisp October fall evening.

4.0,"Taking a break from scotch for a moment to do a bourbon review. This Jeffersons Ocean is from Voyage #4. 45% ABV, and as all Kentucky straight bourbons are it is natural color. This one is an orange amber. I do not know if it is chill filtered or not. 

Plentiful vanilla and mint initially on the nose. Surprisingly there is a wealth of fruity notes. Orange cranberry juice and red berries. Perhaps some tart apples, but not sure on that. The typical bourbon notes are there as well: oak, toffee and caramel. This dram is quite sweet, with notes of cotton candy and pink bubblegum. The rye content in this bourbon is around 25-30%, but it is very subtle on the nose. A pinch of saltiness. I know some people claim this has huge hits of salt due to the ocean aging, but I believe that to be power of suggestion. These barrels are not laying out in the open on the bow of the boat, soaking in the sea air and getting a tan. No, they are sitting in shipping containers so they don't get the urge to go for a swim. 

The palate is minty orange rinds and citrus. Lots of oak present and a little peppery spice. Vanilla and toffee. Berries and a strong note of dried apricots (I've been eating dried apricots lately so it's easy for me to detect). 

Thick and oily mouthfeel that is very pleasant. The finish is medium long with light oak, vanilla and citrus. 

This is the second Jeffersons Reserve that I've had. This first was the Groth Cask, which was a wonderful wine finished bourbon. This one is good, but wholly forgettable. There are plenty of equal or better bourbons out there for less money. This one, along with the Groth Cask, is $80 locally. I would rather buy a bottle of Elijah Craig and Evan Williams Single Barrel and pocket the remaining $15. I would however purchase the Groth Cask for that price. It's very good. This one is good, don't get me wrong, but will remain off my buy list.  Thanks to Ryan for the sample.  3.75"

3.0,"I’m happy to be back in the world of whisk(e)y enjoyment after a 3-month hiatus.  Medication for which drinking alcohol was not recommended is the culprit.  So, perhaps it is forgivable if my first few reviews upon returning are maybe a bit too generous and somewhat vague. The relative novelty of enjoying whisky makes it all taste pretty good, and the time away has left my senses in a somewhat uncalibrated state. We’ll give it a go with this sample from Drinks by the Dram.  

Nose:  A little expected vanilla, but more stewed fruits, especially peaches.  Perhaps peach cobbler? I also note another southern favorite: a hint of strong, sweet iced tea, lime my grandmother from Georgia used to make. 

Palate:  Just a little sweetness, well balanced with oaky barrel flavors. A hint of salt but not in a maritime, briny Islay way. 

Finish:  medium and of a warmth commensurate with its 45 ABV. 

I like it.  Good solid dram. However, likely not worth the $65 it fetches locally.  I think it would be a four star dram but for that.  I would ding it a half star for value, but I will have to just give it three."

I had been waiting to try this bourbon but did not want to invest 80 plus dollars. I sampled it at a whiskey bar and was very impressed. A few drops of water bloomed it out nicely, but it was very good neat.  However, even at the June sale price in NC of $70, that's just not enough value for this whiskey.  There are many pours better than this for $40 or less per bottle.  A gentleman with me at the bar said he always bought the ocean voyages until he blind tasted them against Jefferson's Reserve. He said he selected reserve on his blind taste easily which is $55.  That might be my next approach to the Jefferson's line."

4.0,"Jefferson's Ocean...not quite sure if it's Voyage 3, no info on that on the 3cl sample. 

This is actually a really damn good, classic Bourbon. On the nose there is vanilla, oak spices, fruity cinnamon apples and a bit of light caramel. Never too sweet, the fruityness and sweetness is always tempered by the barrel spice. 

Taste continues along those lines. Vanilla, cinnamon, oak spice, a light note of honey and some kind of nutty flavor. Not sure if it's peanuts, but there is a nut in there. 

The vanilla and oak stay a while, leaving you actually quite satisfied. It's not a cheap whiskey at over 100 bucks a bottle, but it might be worth it. Hell, it might even be a rival for the E.H. Taylor. 

Off to a good start Jefferson. Now I'm kinda curious how the Groth Cask compares....but that's for later. Cheers."

Still, I swear there is something there comparable to what I think separates Tullamore Dew from the low-end Irish Whiskey pack.  For the lack of a better word or more accurate description, I usually call this ""something"" chlorine.  Strange but I like it...and in a bourbon??  I really find it unique.  Price point is somewhat steep though.  2nd sample/I am not sure now if the first sample I tried was the wheated or not, this one was and had more of a traditional bourbon taste.

Caramel, light vanilla, light spice, oak"
3.5,"Lovely caramel, vanilla and oak. Hint of salt (sea air will do that I suppose) - received as a gift. I always felt it was a bit gimmicky but very good overall. Wouldn’t spend $80 on it; maybe 50."

5.0,"Not Voyage 3, Voyage #9

Excellent choice for anyone trying to find something different with a great back story. Aged 8 years inland before making a 10 month journey over seas crossing the equator 4 times. As our store pick it has quickly become a favorite amongst our staff."

4.75,This is one of the best bourbons I’ve had. Wonderful taste and flavours throughout. On the pricier side but the uniqueness of its taste without making the mistake of peating and the smoothness of the finish make it worth the odd splurge.
