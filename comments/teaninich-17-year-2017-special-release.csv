0.75,"17 year old scotch bottled at 55.9%

Nose - classic fruity bourbon barrel finished scotch.  Heavy citrus, light grassy notes, aged oak (though a bit of a wet barn like note).  

Taste - super sweet.  A bit surprisingly so.  I didn't get any of this sweetness on the nose at all.  Layers of oak, vanilla, and then some light apple at the end.  

Teaninich has reached the point of being over oaked and is really giving me some off notes here.  Great overall body, bold flavor, surprisingly sweet and strong flavored.  Heavy water just brings out the bitter notes and starts to hide the sweetness.  

Bad whisky.  Avoid."
