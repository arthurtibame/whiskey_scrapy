3.25,A little weak/watered down but better than tonight’s aperitifs.
3.25,"Dusty walnuts, wax, lanolin, and sawdust make up the majority of the experience, with a smattering of light sherry cask characteristics adding some sweetness as a background"

4.0,"Wowza! This is delicious, and very much resembles the Glenlivet Nadurra First Fill, though at a lower ABV. Pears and faint flowers to the nose, with the palate adding an additional layer of wood. The body is oily with a smooth finish. Recommend!"
