4.0,"""Simply under-rated by most. Not surprising as this is for me a spring and summer whiskey. There is no point comparing it to the peat or sherry ilk. NOSE - mmmmm, grass, lemon, this is a meadow after a slight shower, breeze on your skin reminding you why its so good to be alive; PALATE - light, very light, perhaps why it can be under-rated, subtle, lemons, limes, is this what a flower might taste like? FINISH:- very smooth, no burn at all, medium duration, dry as the meadow fades away you are left with the realisation that tomorrow is back to work meeting people who have no clue what whiskey is and drink awful beers or house-wines. Simply enjoyable. Hud"""
3.0,"I went out for a semi-fancy dinner with some friends today, coincidentally it was held at the biggest whiskey bar in Richmond, Va.  It's called Big Whiskey Grill and it has one of the best bourbon and scotch menus in town.  Unfortunately, it's also quite expensive with even some of the most mundane scotches costing a ridiculous amount.  I decided I would try to keep my bill as low as reasonably possible, while still finding a couple of drams of something new (and interesting) to me.

Up first, lowland single malt, Auchentoshan 18 year old.  It's triple distilled, non-chill filtered and comes in at 43% ABV.  The look is toffee or dark gold, and it created some thin, oily legs that formed and fell slowly down in the Glencairn.

I'm not sure how long the bottle has been open, but I was probably only the second or third pour from it.  The nose was initially very sweet, caramel corn with some oak and alcohol notes.  It was pleasantly floral and became even more so after some time in the glass.  The waiter asked me twice if there was something wrong because I must've swirled and sniffed it a dozen times before finally taking a sip.  My friends also questioned (and tested) my patience...

It was surprisingly young tasting, at first.  Lots of lovely oak spice greeted me with the initial sip and became heavily earthy and floral before drying my mouth rather quickly.  The overall mouthfeel remained thin throughout the entire sip.  Pleasant enough, yet forgettable.

The finish was pretty short with a little bit of a burn.  Flowers and oak dominate even though it stays pretty smooth.  The warmth stays in the mouth causing a drying sensation that, while not offensive, isn't very inspiring either.  It's a solid, lowland style malt that fits the mold.  The 18 years doesn't help or hurt it in my opinion so that makes the 2oz price of $22 seem high.  A solid 3.5 stars.  Cheers."

4.0,"Sample from The Whiskey Exchange. 

Nose is light and complex enough, with honey, ripe berries, green apple, and dried smoky air. 
On the palate, I get biscuity-forward blend of pear and those green apples from the nose, with a decent richness but a younger-than-stated mouthfeel (and lack of overall refinement). I'd believe this as a 15 year but not 18. 
I'd pay $75-85 but not over $100 for sure."

3.5,"Nose : Pretty fruit. Notes of plum, candied orange. Also vanilla.

Taste : Taste is particular, mix of fruits, earth, wood and malt. All elements are balanced, nothing standing out particularly.

Finish : Finish is pretty low-key, but better than the 12 years. Pretty malty with a touch of fruit.

Better than the 12, but miss a bit of originality for an 18 years."
4.0,"Somewhat phenolic, sherry and floral."
4.25,"NOSE: It starts fresh, almost Japanese style. Green grass. Green tea. Ocean spray. Wet campfire hints at the end.

PALATE: It’s strong suddenly with fresh peach and finishes with sea salt.

OVERALL: It scores high with great balance and a unique fresh nose."

4.0,"I hate to use a word so often abused on Distiller, but I have to make an exception here: the Auchentoshan 18 is smooth. The nose has pleasant hints of almonds enveloped by honey. Augmented by that nutty flavor, the palate is a touch sweet with hints of ripe oranges and lime. The finish itself is neither long or short, though the fragile quality of this whisky makes it unsuitable for any water being added. I liked it - I didn't love it though."
3.75,"It's about time to return to the Lowlands, a whisky region often overlooked and underestimated by connoisseurs. Auchentoshan 18 is reminiscent of a flower garden with ripe citrus fruits, pipe tobacco and hints of green tea. Crème brûlée, milk chocolate and oak spices (cinnamon and nutmeg) unfold a complex aroma. Spicy and gingery in the arrival, the taste develops mildly bitter and grainy with notes of vanilla, brown sugar and roasted nuts. The finish is understated, cask-dominated and fades quickly. All in all, a sound but fairly overpriced Single Malt.

5.0,"Heather honey, gentle campfire smoke, sugar cookies, ripe peaches, overall a very charming aroma. Juicy orchard fruits on the palate, Lapsang tea with honey, dark chimney smoke finish. Spans the spectrum of sweet to savory very well. I gotta start drinking more Lowland malts."
3.0,"Fairly generic, save for a kind yeasty, dough-y note that almost (almost) evokes a pot still Irish whiskey. Amber colour (not egregiously coloured); nose of dough, bananas, lemon, cake batter, vanilla (lemon cake?). Cedar, fresh wood. Fresh cut apples (apple skins!), some spice (cinnamon, ginger). Herbal tea and grass. Soft taste, mildly flavoured--well-tamed heat, there's more leafy, herbal greens, a touch of mint, lemon, vanilla, fresh wood. Something a touch tart. Sour apple skins. A bit of smoke (is Auchentoshan even peated?)! Cough drops. As it sits, it does actually develop a bit more character, and there's some white pepper on the finish, leading to some back-of-throat heat and lingering sour apple/lemon/dry wood. It's good, it's well-made--but the Auchentoshan profile has never done much for me, and this guy's no exception. Pleasant glass, but no reason to buy a bottle."

3.5,"Clean aroma, no smoke. A bit of apple flavor, and then oak wood and spices appear in the finish, with the barest hint of smoke. 3 cl sample from the 12 Drams of Christmas Premium (2019 Edition)."
3.75,Nice flavour. Caramel notes.
2.75,"This single malt comes with some distinct portions of nuts, exotic fruits with pineapple in the front, spices (nutmeg and juniper) some green apple and and an inviting orange zest. Something unique I got was paraffin candle wax. It is mildly sweet and has some present malt flavors accompanied by oak-wood. 

All in all it is quite enjoyable but even though it being a 18y it is kinda forgettable. I would drink it again if offered but I’m not sure if I would recognize it blindly. It just isn’t very interesting."

4.5,"Super wood forward, but amazing aroma. Oak flavor, light sweetness underneath, and then a long tail with richness and alcohol burn. It's strange I'd expect the wood to be kind of one dimensional but I love it anyway. A small step below the American oak label for me. Some smoke on the tail"
