4.0,The entry is rather uninspiring but the finish showcases the mizunara effect and happiness is back in the mix. Light and crisp and spicy at the end and gets creamy with some water. Picked this one on a trip to Japan and you'd get the 350 ml bottles as well.

3.0,An interesting whisky. The Miz finish gives it a spicier edge. A little too unbalanced to make this a must buy again tho.
3.0,"Nose - Toasted/baked apple skins, cloves, black tea, oaked chardonnay, dark amber honey.
  Taste - Dried lightly medicinal jujubes, honeyed black tea, light toasted spice, baked apples, hint of black pepper spice.
  Finish - Light bitterness of oversteeped black tea, linger sweet/sour of jujubes, fading baked apple tart/sweetness.
  Score - 77/100 Final Thoughts - So the Mizunara finish on this one is somewhat minimal in that it does add a tiny bit of extra spice as well as this oddly medicinal (but pleasant) taste like that of dried jujubes, but manages to maintain a large part of the apple goodness I get from the standard Chivas Regal. Definitely tasty and worth trying if you get the chance, but I would not go out of my way to look for this one."

4.0,Regular Chivas is decent enough. But mizunara wood creates a category of its own. Definitely worth a try.

4.0,"Sweet, floral, with various, distinctive spices. Very balanced, I really enjoyed it [JG 2018]"
2.0,"Nose: The incense quality of mizunara oak is immediate and defines the nose. There are supporting hints of orchard fruits (apples, pears, peaches, apricots), vanilla and almond but soft aromatic oak dominates everything else.

Palate: The arrival is light and soft with a generally fruity profile. It develops a little very gentle ginger and cinnamon spice and some malt as it unfolds. A light honey note is detectable as well. It's a sweet, smooth palate but a little too shy.

Finish: Very, very short. Light, crisp and fleeting with a little hint of very mild tannin and anise right at the end.

The nose is very pleasant, but as described above rather one-note. There are malty depths below the oak, and it's impossible to hate, but that sandalwood/cedar aroma keeps leaping forward.

The palate is also a little disappointing and there's almost no finish at all.  It's a real pity it was released at only 40%.

Chivas Regal consistently disappoint me and once again they have sunk to the occasion. There is the gleam of a really good blend here but they have been mean with the quantity and quality of the malt component, stingy with the strength, and the precious mizunara casks have been used as little more than top-dressing.

It's absurdly expensive for what it is and it does not represent value for money, considering all the excellent single malts that are in the same price bracket, and the many superior blends that are even cheaper.

""Acceptable"" : 2 stars"

3.5,"the blend of japanese sweetness up top with the tradition barrel flavor underneath is an interesting proposal. the flavors are a little too separated for the smoothest of deliveries, but the mizunara is an interesting flavor twist that makes this pleasantly interesting for a semi-rare mid-priced bottle of blended scotch."

3.5,"This has a fresh, pleasant nose. Feel free to breathe deeply - practically no burn. love these aromas- hints of a fresh herbs, honey, nilla wafer, banana pudding.

Beautiful honey wine color with great legs.

Flavors of pear, something medicinal like cough syrup, honeydew. Medium length finish but one note throughout. Wish there was more depth, but it's really drinkable."
4.25,"First sip can turn you off. The young age is certainly present. Sip two and beyond really opens it up. I’m typically not a Chivas Regal drinker, however the Mizunara Oak is certainly present in the finish. This gives this Whisky a unique taste that is only present in some Japanese Whiskies."

3.5,"Far too much acetone on the nose. Faint undertones of sweetness in the aroma, but only when using a light touch.

Taste is actually quite nice, but hard to separate from the alcohol burn in the nose. There is a sweet, light fruitiness to this with hints of something green and leafy."

3.25,"Tonight, I revisited the Mizunara side-by-side with Hibiki Japanese Harmony, which is about equally priced, and the Yamazaki 12, which is admittedly more expensive.

On the nose, the Mizunara is herbal and slightly dank - very similar to the Hibiki, but more marshy, less sweet, and a bit more harsh. There's a hint of rich fruit to the Yamazaki that gives it a different quality, like a hint of ripe melon, with additional notes of caramel, toffee and condensed milk as it sits out. The Japanese Harmony picks up some sweetness as it opens, also. On the other hand, after a minute, the nose on the Mizunara seems lighter (it may be because it is comparably less aromatic and I came back to it after the Yamazaki).

Flavorwise, the Chivas is a bit harsher tasting than the Hibiki but surprisingly similar.  Both are herbal, but the Chivas Mizunara barrel has a slightly deeper flavor profile, with a bit more bitterness and kick. The Yamazaki is the sweetest of the three, but only barely.  The Yamazaki is higher pitched and smoother, with a sour note by comparison and far less medicinal quality. Coming back to the Mizunara after the Yamazaki makes me think it is different but not necessarily inferior. This time, I'm almost getting licorice notes at the end on the Mizunara.

The Japanese Harmony has the shortest finish, but is very smooth with almost no burn. The Yamazaki lingers a bit longer, but has a slight burn. The Mizunara lingers the longest, but the herbal quality that stays through the end is slightly off-putting. It has the most burn comparably but it's still quite smooth.

The Hibiki is the lightest in color, followed by the Chivas, followed by the Yamazaki at darkest, but all are pretty close"

Palate: Dry, peppery, spicy, finish is a bit spicy and hot, some raw cacao.

Overall: This isn’t Japanese whisky despite the cask wood. It’s pretty punchy even for scotch. Reminds me of a good bourbon due to spice and pepper."

Avent 2019 - 7/24.
Après avoir écouté le très intéressant documentaire ""The Game Changer"", je n'ai soudainement plus le goût de manger de viande, mais le désir de pour du whisky demeure entièrement présent. Un whisky doux et très fruité qui m’impressionne dès les premiers moments. Et vous savez, on n'a jamais de chance de faire une deuxième bonne première impression. On aime bien, une belle découverte!"

3.5,Ok so here we go with another.  I get mostly vanilla and light praline on the nose.  Some honey and caramel vanilla on the palate.  A bit of ethanol creeps in on the back end.  It’s a quick finish with cocoa powder and honey. I wouldn’t buy another bottle and may or may not pass on a drink depending on what else was available.  Iechyd da!

4.25,"I am a chivas fan, and i can tell you that after Royal Salute 21yo, this one is their best expression maybe paired with the ""Ultis"" one. Its name, ""mizunara"" comes from the special japanese cask they have used to partly mature it. Originally it was intended only for the japanese market.

Bottled at 40%abv, tawny color.

On the nose, vanilla cookies, the ones use to make the crest of a pie. Floral notes, orange, flour, a small herbal spiciness also present. Very nice aroma.

On the palate, it is very tasty. Yeah, that is the proper description. Allspice, Vanilla, Oaky; that Almond/Nutty typical note from Chivas. Ashes and coal. Pretty stuff. Aftertaste is mizunara oaky, i consider this a perk. 

Overall this is a very nice dram, i believe it costs around 50$ so you might as well grab it. My score for it is 87 over 100."

3.5,"Granny smith apples still on the tree. A wisp of velvety cream then smoke. Some fine wood rounding it but never making itself unwelcome. Very, very nicely composed so its already a little Japanese that way.

The casking is partial (bottle says 'some') so the full effect is hard to discern but you do notice the wood had more going for it than European or american by itself flavor-wise. Really makes me want to try a finish with more Mizu because again: the wood tastes great.

Nose is butterscotch and vanilla for me.

In the middle I'd maybe add the malt and grain whisky usage gives suuuuuch a luxurious cream/rich/malt it would be a shame to not enjoy this one neat.

The finish is really smooth. I think Chivas could've given us a little more than 40%, but oh well. It wouldve gone to 4.0 or 4.25 easily with some more punch.

The wife picked this out for my birthday as a surprise. Wife knows best ;)"
