3.25,"While this Glenfiddich Our Solera 15 is basically a rebrand of the Glenfiddich 15 Year Solera Reserve, and should basically the same liquid, I seem to like it a tad better than the dram I had during a business trip in Germany a while ago.

On the nose, I discover some apple and pear, typically Glenfiddich, in my opinion.
The palate then reveals some more - baked - apple, but with a touch of cinnamon and some mild spices. Dark red fruits.
The aftertaste is rather long, mostly sweat, but pleasing.

While I don't rate it top-notch, one definitely can't go wrong with a Glenfiddich. I do like the solera principle, and the fact that it's running since 1998. 

I'm doing something slightly similar with my very own 'Perpetuum blend' in which I pour a single dram of every bottle of scotch I buy. When the bottle is full, I pour five sample bottles and make room for some new drams. In theory, there always will be a trace of the first whiskies in it."
3.5,"Nose of dark honey and stone fruit skins. Slight burn on tongue, but finished with leather and light smoke."
