3.75,"Nose: Banan, honey, oatmeal, light citrus

Taste: Nice sweetness without being overly sweet. Fruity like orange, pear maybe, also oatmealy sweetness. And something i can not quite wrap my head around in the finish, maybe coffe, quite dark note."
4.25,A delicious whisky for its age (around 4 years). A little sweetness and good mouth feel. Full flavoured and good finish too. Excellent.

4.5,"Apricots, tart yellow pears and honey roasted almonds on the nose. Initially on the palate there is big hit of oak spice and minerals. Followed by vanilla, molasses and figs. Marzipan and tobacco finish. 

Very impressive for such a young whisky."

4.0,"Having this at the distillery in Cotswold...for young 3 yr old malt, really well made with all local ingredients.  Taste further enhanced by the local Cotswold vistas..."
3.0,"Sweet and very pleasant. Lots of malty cereal and bourbon sweetness on the nose with a good dose of red wine cask influence. It will be excellent in a few more years, it’s got quite a new spirit punch at the moment which will mellow with age. Check out the cask aged gin, that is special!"

4.5,"My review is really for Cotswold Single Malt, apologies to all. Cotswold is only in the neighborhood of three years age, I can hardly imagine how good a 10-12 year would be. I wanted to try this even though it wasn't available in my area, so got it from a San Diego source. Reviews were all excellent: ""Whisky Bible"" 94-95, Distillers.com 87, and TheWhiskeyReviewer ""A"". The Cotswold distillery is new, having opened in 2014. They are going to great pains to produce a single malt in the traditional way with stone floor maltings, local barley crop, turning the malted barley with wooden shovels and rakes, fermenting for FOUR days rather than the typical two days to allow fruity-floral notes, using a narrower width of the middle distillate, etc. Their efforts are shown in my bottle, which is wonderful. My bottle states that it is 92 proof, 2014 crop of Odyssey barley from the Barrington Park Farm, bottled in 02/2018, and is one of 8600 bottles. I know Macallan uses Odyessy barley, and this dram reminds me very much of a non-sherry finish Macallan. In the glass it is a copper amber with good legs. The nose offers slightly sweet fruity malt, a touch of honey, and is overall very soft. On the tongue it is thick, almost oily. It tastes of malt and honey, a hint of brown sugar, gentle spice, and a ripened fruit--apricot jam? There is warmth on the finish and these flavors linger well. My first dram seemed a little hot without a drop or two of water. However, the next day, and then the next day as well (had to be sure) this was not an issue at all. Not sure if the difference was my mood, etc., or the opening of the bottle. This is really good stuff. They have won 19 golds in the past couple years, and I would say deservedly so. Check out their informative website listed here on Proof66, it is interesting. I think this retails for $60 or so, but is not widely distributed. May the Force be with you and to find a bottle."

4.0,Solid whiskey. Slight floral notes. Easy drinker. Very pleased. Abv is just right. Well rounded.

4.25,Very spicy with honey and butterscotch
2.5,"Nose: charred oak, dark brown sugar, and a bit of funky cream cheese at the end.

Palate: very dry texture that quickly vanishes. The oak notes arrive first, followed by orange peel and a slight fint of dark berries.

Finish is very brief from the dry texture, and mostly carries a light alcohol burn with notes of fresh oak (not charred)."

1.0,"Very basic. Reminds me of an Irish. Smells young. You can taste a bit more of the spice due to its proof but it’s harsh due to its age. Sweet fruit and vanilla. Bit of complexity but the bite  overwhelms the flavor. 

Adding water brings out the vanilla and cuts the bite after the first sip. Butterscotch and peach cobbler with  carmalized sugars. 

Overall...pretty underwhelming. The ABV is much appreciated, but could do better with longer in the barrel."
3.75,"Color: Light -> Medium. (Amber?)

Nose: Fruity

Taste: Light body. Doesn't linger for long. Easy drinking.Getting some vanilla. Possibly some wood-flavour, oak?"
3.5,"Color is amber.  Nose starts with a little ethanol, but quickly passes to honey and fruits, both citrus and sweeter ripe stonefruit. Beneath that is mild butterscotch. First sip is spicey, with fairly intense baking spices and black pepper followed by a a malty mid-palate and a deliciously sweet citrus and peach late palate. Additional sips show notes of caramel and more fruit. Mouthfeel is creamy. Lingering flavors from above for the finish."
4.25,"Nose: caramelized peaches over vanilla ice cream
Taste: creamy and mouth coating with peach and apricot 
Finish: long with toffee and caramel and lots of ripe peach and apricot"
3.5,"Well I’ll go to the bottom of our stairs, as we say back home: England makes decent whisky. A veritable salad of fruits, with a finish that skews to something akin to a Cotswolds cider. Who needs Scotch when you can get this tariff free?"
