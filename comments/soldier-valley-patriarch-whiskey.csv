2.5,"I bought a bottle of the whiskey a little while ago for the bottle it is shaped like a military canteen. I had no prior knowledge of this and no expectations of it. With that in mind, my opinion is that this whiskey is not a sipping drink. It is rough and unrefined neat and on the rocks. However, the silver lining of the drink is when mixed with soda. Not soda water but Coke, Diet Coke, or ginger ale that is when it begins to taste like something better. Alone it tastes like rot gut whiskey I drank in college but with a soft drink, it tastes respectable. I will probably not buy this again unless it is on sale because I do like the bottle but it is not the liquid inside."
