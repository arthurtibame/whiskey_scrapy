1.25,"Over the weekend I met up with some of my drinking friends and one of them offered this to me as an inexpensive Scotch and it was not pleasant. Poured neat it was sharp and watery and with ice, the flavors smoothed out but it still was not tasty. He told me he got it on sale for $13 so for that price it is not bad but I have a hard time seeing a use for this stuff. I have read that Grant has some good blends but this is not one of them."
3.25,"Fruity, sweet, a bit malty.. Lots of Apple and pears.. In the mouth bit too much alcohol and nice sweetness.. I was expecting a beer aftertaste, didnt feel it

For Its price.. A good whisky

3.75,"Simple with woody finish. Sweeter than standard grants.
Good blend and value for money"
1.5,"On the never ending quest for good value scotch I picked this up. It actually has some decent reviews on the web. Neat, thin legs and weak nose. Has some vanilla-ish notes but not much malt, fairly nondescript. Palate is grain alcohol with slight bit of malt flavor. Finishes quick and not much to say, its thin and bland. I should know better with a budget blend. I thought the ale cask would enhance the situation(im a beer lover) It does not. I used it to mix gunslingers( scotch & root beer) to get through the bottle. Pretty good as a mixer but would not repurchase as I prefer to drink scotch neat. Hard pass but think its discontinued now anyway.......64/100"

3.0,"I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised by this whisky. In my reading on this, the whole idea of finishing in some type of ale or beer cask sounded interesting. I did not want to spend a ton on trying this out, and I doubted that any local pub in my area would have it behind the bar. At $20.00 it seemed like a go, and as Grant also owns Glenfiddich, and has an IPA finish, how could I loose?
A sweet nose, green apple and pears, young, no trace of any hops, or anything close to it.
You can feel the grain, but it almost effervescent? My mind must be playing tricks as to the ale, but I can feel it. Sweet with a very, very, slight puff of smoke at the end. Now the finish. He is where the ale kicked in, for me. The only way to describe it is that it reminded me  of pouring a beer and getting a large foam head on it, then sucking in all the foam. There is that certain ""foam"" taste. That's it.
I wondered how this would hold up in ice. It lost most of the fruit, but I still get that fizz, a little more ale in the back, and that finish is still there. I may just have to get another after this is gone."
