3.25,"I'm really not sure why I purchased this sample as I thought the 18 year was pretty crap and the 21 barely above average...I must have bought them all together, been asleep at the wheel or just generally more tolerant of averageness. These days distilleries only get so many chances and they're cut. This one was in no danger from rocking the boat. Green apple, citrus, light vanilla and a bit of spice....light on the flavour in general. I left it a while dropped a few drops of water in and that helped a bit, though the green apple bitterness was still in the aftertaste. 3.25"
