3.5,I don't think I've ever tasted a sherry finished rye whisky. TBWC has taken which sounds like a below average spirit based on reviews of other James E Pepper efforts and transformed it to something not to bad. I'm not going to get carried away and start raving but TBWC are a good IB and they've done a decent job here. The only criticism is that rye plus oloroso is a slightly on the sickly sweet side but generally the oloroso and peppery rye marry well. Solid 3.5.
