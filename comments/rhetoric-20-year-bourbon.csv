3.75,"Copper, thick legs. Cherry, lemon. Mildly sweet, caramel, cream. Medium body, mild burn.
Pleasant, unexceptional."

4.0,"While the well-versed may turn up their nose at this for being overpriced mystery whiskey and the uninitiated may fall head over heals for ""20yo"" I find myself somewhere in between. The bottle is gorgeous, the taste--on my dense palate--is delicious, full, and woody, the price is...well, we won't talk about that.  This is a great bourbon. I went to three different states before I found it and am quite pleased. Don't buy it for its age statement, don't discount it for its  sales pitch, enjoy it for what it is--and buy it because the bottle is pretty.

Edit: If you think the proof is too low or that it's over filtered, vat a 1:1 with Stagg Jr. Batch 3 or 4 and thank me later."

3.0,"Should have been released at Barrel Proof. Nothing hot about this bourbon. It's smooth like candy and oaky like you are sucking on staves.  I happen to like heavily oaked bourbons so this suits me, with exception to the low proof."

3.0,Not what I had hoped. But I just picked up the 21 year as well. Waiting to open it... But can't find it on Distiller. Has anyone tried it yet?
