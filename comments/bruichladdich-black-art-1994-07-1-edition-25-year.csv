4.75,"It smells very bourbon sweet, toffee and caramel heavy. Bit of fruit (pear?) behind the sweetness. Definitely matches the palate, has a lot of complexity but very mellow. Absolutely delightful and lingers for minutes."

5.0,"Another great Black Art. All so good and slightly different hard to pick a favorite from 4,5,6, and 7. Amazing with notes of chocolate, tropical fruit, cherries, flowers, raisins, oranges, vanilla, almonds, hazlenuts, berries, caramel, sultanas, malt, pepper, and a little smoke. Guessing by this flavor profile, this was likely matured in a combination of bourbon, sherry, port, red wine, and sauternes casks. If there is anything that can cure this coronavirus drama, it is some black magic."

4.25,Rich abundant nose. Sweet. Dried fruit palate. Reminds me of Hibiki to be honest. Almost like Hibiki and Yamazaki fused. Excellent.
