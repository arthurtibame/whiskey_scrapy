4.25,"The color is a beautiful dark amber that coats the glass in heavy legs. The nose starts with cherry cola, mild baking spices, charred oak and buttery caramel. Charred oak and vanilla open up on the palate and is quickly followed by cherry cola and intense baking spices, wrapping up in a rich and buttery mouth feel. The palate melts away for a finish is medium long with oak and cinnamon that lingers alongside a fading creaminess. It is a wonderful sipper with a complex palate and a simple but wonderful finish."
