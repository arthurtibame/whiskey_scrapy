1.0,"Appearance: So, on this visit of my personal “bottom shelf matters” campaign, we come across another blended American. The color of which is a burnished bronze with extremely watery legs rushing down my glass’s interior.

Nose: The simple nose does not lead you to expect much from the rest of the experience. The notes I did detect are caramel, honey, clover, wood chips and sawdust (Not a bad combination, really.)

Taste: This whiskey’s unremarkable palate starts with sour pine sap as its first detectable note, followed by sourdough bread and overripe fruit all being laced together by a biting sour body.

Finish: There is a short finish leaving behind a bitter grapefruit-like aftertaste.

Thoughts: You know, I'm glad I tried it, but I think it was well named. Because much like the real Wall Street, it left a bad taste in my mouth (I’m joking). Seriously though, in my opinion, this whiskey is good to mix (I had a decent toddy the other night with this whiskey.) but I wouldn't have it again neat. If you'd like a real cheap mixer, this whiskey is for you. But if you'd like something that can stand on its own, I'd keep looking. Luxco, this one’s not for me, but thanks! Cheers!"
