3.5,"From the distillery - 51% rye, 45% corn, 4% malted barley. 

No wonder I like this one so much. It’s like Pikesville’s younger brother!"
4.0,"I’m highly surprised by this MGP rye. This bottle is Batch 002. I like their optimism. With two leading zeros, King’s Family Distillery expects to bottle many more batches!

Anyway, It’s light and sweet and an easy drinker. My first glass didn’t taste like the traditional 95/5 rye. Maybe more like Old Forester’s new rye with its high barley content?

Sazerac Rye is about the same price - I paid $35 - and I think I might like this one better. Next time you’re in Knoxville, pick up a bottle and try it yourself."
