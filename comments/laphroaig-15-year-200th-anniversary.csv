4.5,"A beautiful Saturday.  Worked outside building a firewood shed.  Now after a nice meal, relaxing with a pour watching Grand Ol’ Opry live stream with Luke Combs and Craig Morgan.  The Laphroaig I purchased some time ago and shared but haven’t myself tasted.  Well, tonight I was in the mood for something with some meat and peat and figured this should be able to meet those demands. 

The color is a pale yellow, almost clear. 

There is a bonfire on the beach and a sweet whisky is in hand.  The first exposure is quite welcoming.  Slowly emerging are tropical fruits of pineapples, apricots.  As time progresses, a nice earthy quality becomes apparent of cucumbers and mint and as it blends with the brine and peat, you are drawn in further.  Add some toffee and vanilla.

A soft arrival that initially brings a subtle sootiness.  The texture is silky and soft.  Then, when you get passed the light peat and softness, a plume of sugar sweetness comes forward and takes root.  All in soft and elegant mix the flavors swirl and intertwine: tobacco, sea salt, vanilla, black pepper, caramel, apples and dark chocolate.  

A long lasting subtle finish that is sweetened tobacco, black pepper, lemon zest and oak tannins. 

At a respectable 43%, from the outset, the whisky delivers.  Aromas, flavors and finish.  The balance of the aromas and flavors is masterfully blended. There is no overpowering peat, spice or sweetness.  It’s an easy sipper and remains relatively complex.  One of the best Laphroaig’s I have had (haven’t had Lore yet).  All had for $74, and quite worth it.  [95/100][Tasted: 4/25/20]"

5.0,This is an absolute must if you can get your hands on a bottle. This 15 keeps his smoke punch but manage to have a surprisiny smooth finish.  At first I found the finish to be quite varnishy but after another sip it developped in a beautiful cookie daught taste.  This whisky totally deserve to be the distillery 200th year limited edition whisky.

5.0,"Bottle: L5246MB1 ... 23221159.  This is really a great one.  Absolutely in it's own league with flavor, complexity and personality.  The reviews here are close enough for me to omit adding my own tasting notes--yes, there is a perfect balance of peat, peat smoke and fruitiness with iodine and salt.  It is a robust, intriguing dram that I will miss greatly when the bottle is empty. Update: bought another bottle today...fears abated!  92/100 MMB 11-06-16"

4.0,"We'll start with the review, and then get personal...The nose is cleanly medicinal, with peat, brine and iodine masking just the faintest hint of soft apples.  The palate is fairly smooth (especially so for a Laphroaig), and the peat mixes nicely with the brine, smoke, and iodine. After a few seconds resting on the tongue I can discern the band-aids and just a hint of the rubber that are both common to almost every Laphroaig. Finish is opened with peat and closed by smoke, which lasts a good two minutes before it's completely gone.  All in all, a very, very good whisky.  So why only 4 starts?  Time to get personal;  Laphroaig 15 was my first single-malt over $40 (it was 2004 or 2005 I think, give me a little grace here) and it absolutely floored me.  I could not fathom the smells and flavors that were coming out of the bottle and glass.  My last original-edition 15 Yr was purchased in 2009, and I actually took tasting notes.  The original smelled of creosote, tar and smoldering grass. The palate was rich, very oily, and tasted of smoked meats, charred bacon, pine tar, band-aides, iodine and peat, all cloaked in a heavy smoke that is almost, but not quite, overbearing.  The finish was all smoke; thick, heavy, and lasted seemingly forever.  Laphroaig can say they made the new identical to to the old, but the resulting product is little more than a shadow of the former's greatness.  I guess I can close by saying: If you've never before had Laphroaig 15, you should try this.  It's excellent in every way a good Scotch should be.  It's balanced, nuanced, displays hints of fruit with iodine, brine and peat, and the finish is very typical of Islay.  Unfortunately for those that were lucky enough to have the original, you know it was none of those...there was no fruit, no balance, no gentle smoke...it was in your face, overwhelming your senses, demanding every ounce of your attention and alternating between punishing and rewarding you for daring to open the bottle.  And it was extraordinary."

5.0,"Mellow combination of sweet peat, olive brine, and pipe tobacco on the nose. Sweet taste of pears makes its way into the palate, only to be counterbalanced with campfire smoke and sea salt. The finish is smooth and gently spiced. Really hard to keep my hands off this stuff!"
5.0,"My favorite scotch, alongside Talisker 10.  This one opens with a beautiful char, almost like searing a filet, and yet layers in dark berry notes quickly.  There is a perfect call and response between the smoke and peat, on the one hand, and moderate sweetness, on the other.  Pepper arrives first on the palate, then smoke curls in from around the edges of the mouth.  There are hints of saltiness, but the longer it mingles in the mouth, the more caramel and honey emerge.  The finish is the highlight here, impossibly long (new flavors emerging even minutes later) and complex, with hickory smoke and a flowering of 60+% dark chocolate."

The nose is pleasant with aromas of peat, smoke, salt, and what appears to be lemons - it's both subtle and complex at the same time. The palate and body is rich and full, a continuation of the nose's aromatic notes. It all works wonderfully together towards a finish that has depth and length. I really enjoy it."

4.0,Great drop. Lovely balance of sweetness and peat. The peat isn't as diminished as the 18 year which I like. Tried after a 55% Edradour so taste buds are muted but have a bottle at home and will have to retry. Still prefer the intensity and medicinal flavour of the 10 year or An Cuan...

4.0,"Special thanks to Dreaming of Islay! I had to do a double take and say a loud, “What the what!?!” with this dram. This one makes me want to play “Connection” by Elastica. Anyway, to the nose! I really hate the way grapefruit tastes, but this fragrance here is REALLY nice. I smell a slight salty peppery whiff of honey in there as well. The floral scent balances well with the fruit and faint peat. Thankfully, this does not have grapefruit on the palate, but it’s a nice plump juicy strawberry mixed with raspberries. More peppery pops of goodness, along with a slight mature peat smoke on the back end. That slight charcoal touch makes me want to call this offering “Jeeves”. It’s just cool enough without being over pretentious. My only complaint is that I wish the finish was longer. Don’t get me wrong, that Lagavulin 16 is damn nice, but this…This is now rare.. And that somehow gives it a little more mystique. Kinda like that cute girl that you KNOW you like, but don’t know much about."

My closest comparison would be Bowmore 12 year but this is significantly more refined. Still not worth the price for me. $185 in Ontario."

Definitely no regrets with the purchase but given what I’d read re. this malt I was prepared to be wowed. The extra 5 years in cask certainly mellow out that classic Laphroaig flavor. It’s a tasty dram for certain and worth checking out if you get a chance, just don’t expect a world beater."

4.0,"I bought this bottle from my stash over to my cousin's a few weeks ago.  He invited a few family members for his daughter's party.  She just had got accepted to Univ of Pennsylvania's pre-med.  So...the segmentation in this party were about a dozen or so 16-18 yr old teens, a few less than 10 yr olds, and then about 4 or 5 of us in the 35+ age category.   As soon as I opened this, I overheard one teen say "" oh no, I smell smoke"".   Another promptly replied ""no, it's okay...I think the smell is from those old folks there."".  Great.  Now that I was labeled a smelly old guy, I can now get to my Laphroaig without further delay.   Sweet smoke it is.  You can smell a sweet peat immediately.  Taste doesn't disappoint.  More sweet smoke, with a hefty dose of sea salt, medicinal iodine, and dark chocolate.  It's just a brutish as its 10 yr old sibling, but with a more refined elegance to it.   If this is what "" old people"" smell like...I'm gonna be doing a lot of voluntary services at our local community senior citizen center..."

4.0,"This review was transferred over from the Barreled App:


You can always tell you are drinking Laphroaig as soon as you pull the cork from the bottle.  Surprisingly, this is where the 200th anniversary 15 YO changes gears from their most traditional offerings.

That medicinal, smoky smell fills the glass (and sometimes the room) but after that everything seems really restrained.  This is the most mellow Laphroaig I think I've ever had and while I'm not complaining, it really isn't what I expected or wanted from a special release.  It is, however, a perfect way to indoctrinate your non-Islay drinking friends into peaty single malts.

I rated this one a bit lower because it feels like it should be called 10 Year Old Light and thankfully the price wasn't jacked up for the anniversary release.  I'm still a huge Laphroaig fan, but this one was kind of a letdown to me."

4.25,"This is such a special Laphroaig - so much of the aromas and flavours belong to the sea.

4.75,"There was a time years back when the original 15 yr Laohroaig was the crown jewel in its portfolio . The 10 was the entry level, but the 15 was the one in most demand.  Including from Prince Charles, which led to Laphroaig being granted a Royal Warrant ( in essence, endorsed by the royal family as the only whisky to be in the palace).  That original 15 is long gone, probably going for hundreds in auction.  Till a few years ago, until when this new bottling was created.  

It’s been a while since I’ve had a Laphroaig.  Nothing quite like the medicinal phenolic aroma, followed by classic briny seaweed taste with a sizing of iodine.  That description sounds bad for those that haven’t this, but once you do, that is spot on in a really good way.  

Well, thanks to @Scott_E, I got a chance to give this a whirl.  I had it a few years ago when it came out, but am thankful for another shot at it, especially considering this particular variety is now hard to find.  

This 15 yr version is tamer than the 10; almost muted in intensity.  But that doesn’t make it boring.  Anything but boring.  Amazing full body oily profile of citrus, brine, anchovies.  Hefty dose of sea salt, a bit of tabacco leaf.  Don’t go in expecting the brute force of the 10.  This is milder, refined.  I’m not sure if it’s now discontinued or a part of their core lineup again—-either way, if you come upon this, it’s a no-brainer buy, provided price is right."
