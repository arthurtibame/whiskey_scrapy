1.0,It’s kind of sweet and watery tasting
3.0,"Very sweet, a little thin, but overall pretty good"
3.5,"Smells initially like ethanol and acetone. Fairly strongly, too much for just 40% ABV. Eventually you’ll catch some vanilla. 

Taste is much more subtle, mostly vanilla flavors, a little maraschino cherry. Maybe a slight spice. But it’s one of those whiskys that don’t have much flavor. 

Somehow this was $50 per bottle at the time and location of purchase, should never be more than $25."

2.0,"I'm a recent transplant to Oregon & have decided to try the local brews & whiskey... I was introduced to the Pendleton by my brilliant neighbor...he loves it, albeit with water...I tried it neat...very smooth, but lacking considerably in depth. If this is a blend of fine Canadian whisky, then I've missed the idea. The price is good for your next party, but to enjoy with a good Alec Bradley, not worthy"

My father tried to pawn his opened-but-two-fingers-low bottle on me as a great mixing whiskey, but I get the distinct feeling he was making room in his cabinet for another bottle of Blantons. Thankfully, I have friends who enjoy their whiskey with a can of coke, so the bottle didn't go wasted."

2.0,"Appearance: The color shines out of the glass as a pale gold. The legs are thin and watery.

Nose: The nose is both sweet and funky and both sides seem to fight for dominance. Notes of vanilla, caramel, pancakes with maple syrup, marigolds among other garden flowers fight with craft glue and a strange metallic note. 

Taste: There is not much going on as far as the palate is concerned except for it's clearly meant to be sweet. Notes of honeysuckle, cheap thin syrup, overripe strawberries, and something like pine sap cover the palate.

Finish: The finish is short, thin, and easy going down with no burn. There is also a aftertaste reminiscent of cornbread for me.

Thoughts: Well, this Canadian blend was good to try. I'm not disappointed but I'm not impressed either. I think it would be good as a mixer whisky and maybe over ice, but neat it wasn't my cup of tea, or, glass of whisky. The website, as a side note, can also use some work. It was very vague and said pretty generic things like it being actually aged in oak! ...Well no duh, that's every whiskey out there! (Besides moonshine) Anyways, off my rant. It's worth trying, but not falling in love with. Cheers!"
