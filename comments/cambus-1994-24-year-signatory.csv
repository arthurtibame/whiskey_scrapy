3.0,"Tasted from bottle no. 330 of 447, cask #55891.

Nose: Fruity and floral with a strong ethanol aroma. Grassy notes, a hint of aniseed and a smell like hot metal or charcoal (I often get that from single grain whisky).

Palate: A lightly fruity start followed by an herbal/licorice development. Cereal and woody flavours - slightly astringent and numbing.

Finish: Long, but too much ethanol heat. Water is recommended. A little lingering fennel/aniseed.
        
This was distilled on July 24th 1991 and bottled on November 4th 2015.  Maturation was in a refill PX sherry butt. The quality of manufacture was high with no off notes or intrusive aromas. Overall it has a grassy/herbal profile but it comes across as simplistic and lacking in character, with not much to say.
        
Very much an “also ran” whisky that is unlikely to be found on the shelves anymore, and not worth acquiring at auction. There are several bottlings of Cambus distilled in 1991 marketed by different independent bottlers. They range from 23-25 years old - I’ve tried three and none has been inspirational, or frankly worth the money.

“Above Average” : 3 stars"
