4.5,"I have been drinking beautiful whisky lately, what can i say?

It is because of the samples. I bought whatever i read it was good. And this, was good.

Bottled at 46%abv, with a tawny color.

The nose is so particular, is that hybrid between raisins and peanuts, that ""orange raisin"". It is that. So memorable. There is also sherry, blackberry marmalade, a smoke that resembles a brandy shot and maybe grapes. Nice aroma.

On the palate, very complex. Caramel, smoke, raisins, mint, oily like kerosene, ginger, tobbacco, ashes, hot. 

Finish a little oily. Not the best kind.

Overall i give this baby a 92 over 100. I would recommend this dram, but depends on the price. I bought a sample and i dont really know the price of the full bottle but 80$ would be fair for it. Cheers!"
3.25,"Very nice but if you can go for the Tawny Port finish instead, which is quite a bid better and more unique. The PX finish on this one is distinct but with a plethora of PX finishes out there really not that special - not even from within the Speyside."

4.0,"Day 5. Today we got a real sherry bomb. And a good one at that. 

Nose is pretty typical with dark fruits, raisins, walnuts and a tingle of honey. Very light, fruity and friendly. Reminds me a bit of Glenfiddich 15, and that is not a bad thing. 

Taste is sweet, but it has enough spice to offset the sweetness so it doesn't become overwhelming. There is a healthy dose of chocolate, raisins, dark fruits and vanilla in this, as well as some oak spice. The higher proof helps as well and gives it some warmth.

Aftertaste leaves a lot of fruits and cocao, with some tingly spice for a good long time. Very nice stuff. 

Not the cheapest, and apparently also discontinued, but if you can grab a bottle you won't be disappointed, as long as you like speyside sherrybombs."

3.0,The finishing has a lingering wooden taste that is the only thing that I found too strong. Otherwise smooth and refined for a sherries Whisky.

5.0,"Fabulous whisky tasted and bought in May 2017, full bodied, excellent sherry notes, among the best I've tasted so far (over 3,000 whiskies), really powerful nose, aromas, flavors and lingering finish that last forever. Forget all the previous reviews: few whisky connoisseurs understand whisky and the fact that wood account for over 75% of flavours and aromas, here in 2017, we have a gem. Yes, maybe back in the days, a year ago or more people tasted it  it was lesser quality barrels, but this batch, right here, right now, is truly exceptional and is worth of over 91 points."

4.0,"Definitely a pleasure for sherry lovers, particularly if Pedro Ximenez aromas are your thing. I am one, so I really enjoyed this whisky, especially its finish where the dried raisin notes really affirm themselves. The nose is complex, with dried fruits, caramel and crisp lemons, and the body is full and syrupy. Enjoy!"
