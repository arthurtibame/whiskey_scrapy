4.5,"This IS a luxury whisky. A blend from whiskies that are at least 40yo, this one is smooth as silk on your palate. A 62 gun salute is the best kind of celebration you can get from the UK royalty, and this is why this whisky gets its name. Even the letters on the decanter are made out of 24 karat gold.

On the nose, i get the most beautiful chocolate fudge and freshly cut oranges. After the first sip, this two notes become incredibly enhanced. 

On the palate, it might be the smoothest whisky i have ever had. Macadamian Nuts, Dark chocolate, a dessert that is called ""mil hojas"" in spanish, which translates into ""Strudel"" in english. Dulce de Leche. So sweet and fancy. 

Aftertaste is salty and there are notes of ginger spice. Very long and rewarding. 

Overall this is a great dram. A very hard to find and a expensive one too. A proper score for it is at least 95/100. I consider myself lucky for having tasted it. Sláinte Mhath!!"
