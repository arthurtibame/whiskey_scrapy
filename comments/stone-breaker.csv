3.75,I’m really enjoying this. Maple syrup on the nose. Sweet and smooth
3.75,"Quite lovely... smooth, lightly vanilla, maltier sweetness presumably from the American blend."

3.75,"On the Nose, I get straight Maple, very, very sweet. 

On the palate.  Water really opens this Spirit up.  It starts very sweet, like a Maple Corn, but quickly turns to a very strong peat taste with an almost, unnoticeable burn.  The finish is very short.  

All in all not a bad whiskey.  Just a simple whiskey, that's not awfully complex."
