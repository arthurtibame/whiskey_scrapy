3.75,The 3rd Ardbeg special session dram was a cask strength version of the Ardbeg Blaaack...I thought the committee release was that but apparently not. They pared it with a glass of pinot from the vineyard. Didn't blow me away but be good to try the lower strength committee and or standard by itself
