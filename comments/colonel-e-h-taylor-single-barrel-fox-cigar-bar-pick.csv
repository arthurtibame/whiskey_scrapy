3.75,"The E.H. Taylor finally has single barrel picks available (this one is from Fox Cigar Bar in Gilbert, Arizona) Are they better then the regular Single Barrel offerings? I tasted them blind labeled sample A and B! Let's dive in...

Sample A: Upon entry we have wonderful deep burnt brown sugar, caramel and slight vanilla notes. As we move to the mid palate you get a bit of a spice swell prodominently clove with the oak presence coming thru and some nice tobacco and old leather notes. Finish is long with some oak and the burnt brown sugar returning with a mild cherry taste. It lingers with a wonderful burn.

Sample B: Light entry with a burst of granny smith apples dipped in caramel, vanilla and a dash of cinnamon sugar. As the mid palate arrives you are greeted with orange zest, toasted oak and brown sugar. Finish adds some leather with more toasted oak and that granny smith apple note. It's got a lovely creamy texture to it and was definitely the easier to drink of the two.

Verdict: This really is a toss up and is down to personal preference. If you want the standard EHT experience we all love sample A is the clear winner. If you want something different with a lovely mouthfeel, sample B is for you. For me it's going to depend on my mood honestly. They are both neck and neck. 

Reveal: Sample A is the standard issue and Sample B is the Fox's pick. One thing is for sure, the premium price for the pick is definitely not warranted, however it's still a lovely Bourbon. 

Cheers All!"
