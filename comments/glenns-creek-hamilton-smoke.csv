4.25,"Barrel 1H, Bottle 146.  Distilled from grain and cane, aged in used barrels.  Peated Malt is added.  The grain, cane, and peat smoke is very well intertwined on the nose, and are all present, with the peat smoke complementing, and not overpowering.  The palate delivers some initial sweetness, followed by some spice and smokiness.  The finish is both long and powerful.  The price is borderline high, but it is a well crafted spirit, and is truly a craft spirit.  Would like to try with more aging.  My score was 87.5"
