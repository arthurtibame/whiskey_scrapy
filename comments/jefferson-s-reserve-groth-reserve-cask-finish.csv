3.5,Definitely prefer the Ocean Voyage version and the Evan Williams single barrel prior. It's not a bad dram but has all the flavor profiles i'm not a fan of in a bourbon.

4.0,Very smooth goes down easy very flavouefull
3.5,This is an enjoyable whiskey with a very florally flavor. Notes of cherry and ever so slight Cabernet. Drinks just a little too light at 45%. I wish the proof was higher so some of the flavor and true wine notes would shine through.
4.5,"Nose: dry Cabernet, dark fruits, light earthy tobacco finish
Palate: complex red fruit, dark cherry, dry Cabernet, vanilla and clean spice"

5.0,If Bourbon and Red Wine got together and had a baby this would be their child and the would name it Groth. This is great stuff some of the smoothest bourbon that I have ever tried. It's very high in vanilla and deep northern berry. Placing it on my top shelf.

4.0,"Initial pour highlighted eye and spicy in the nose, the quickly softened to big, warm plum of th Cabernet cask. The front of the finish speaks to icing of a cinnamon bun, then moves to classic vanilla, cherry warmth of a classic high Kentucky bourbon. This is an intersection of classic/classic."

4.0,"This was my contribution to the small bourbon tasting last night.  I've had quite a few Jefferson's Reserve bourbons and I've found them all quite enjoyable.  I purchased this bottle in an effort to help my ""bourbon buddy"" complete the current Jefferson's lineup.  I thought this would be the most interesting simply because wine finished scotch has become very appealing to me, recently.  This bottle comes in at 90.2 proof and contains 6 Year Old juice that was finished for 9 months in French oak casks that previously held Groth Cabernet Sauvignon wine.

Right away there was a blast of dark berries and grapes on the nose.  It hits you immediately upon popping the cork.  The vanilla and oak take up a bit of a muted position and only really get noticed about mid-sip.  There's a decent rye presence throughout the entire sip but it doesn't interfere or overpower the wine flavors, and actually helps hide the expected dryness.  It has a lengthy finish that's actually pretty enjoyable as all the flavors hang around asking for attention before slowly fading away.  I'm glad I bought this bottle, since after the tasting, the rest came back home with me.  I think I'm going to really enjoy sipping through this one for awhile.

I believe the price point was a bit high ($70), but most Jefferson's are a bit on the pricier so this was expected and wasn't too bad, either.  Overall, quite tasty and another nice addition to my rye and bourbon review catalog.  Cheers."

4.0,"As the end of the work week closes, I look forward to sitting back and tasting one of many samples (and then some).  I decide to deviate a bit from the Scots and go American.  I sit back and pour myself the Groth while catching up on ‘Billions’ and ‘Homeland’.  This American pour was not what I expected at all.

A pour and a nose exposes sweet, dark fruit; port-like wine notes.  But this fruity juice also has a inviting, balanced spicy side of rye and cinnamon.  As it opens, the wine notes tend to dominate but the spicy notes remain and that rye-ness becomes more of an allspice.  The bourbon traits of vanilla and brown sugar also rise up and this dram becomes a lovely potpourri.  The first sip is initially spicy-hot blast from the nice higher proof.  The medium viscosity liquid, upon the initial sips, reveal the Cabernet finishing as the grape notes are slowly drawn out as well as wine-grape tannins.  So far, this sounds like a wine review, however, this is definitely a whiskey.  Those wine notes blend and intermingle with bourbon flavors: corn, vanilla, rye, brown sugar.  The blending creates a mulled-wine effect.  As all this intermingling and dance of flavors begins to wind down, the fruity wine notes remain on the palate, along with wood/oak and vanilla, however, unfortunately and surprisingly, brief.

I was actually impressed by this whiskey as this was something rather unique.  The wine casks actually provide a pleasant twist to a bourbon.  The darker wine provides a counterbalance to the sweet and spicy flavors.  A versatile whiskey that can pair well as an aperitif, a main meal or with dessert.  The only negative is not of flavor, but as accessibility, in terms of price.  The whiskey sells for upwards of $86 and that places it in the upper range of cost and will price many out.  However, this is worth seeking out in a bar or restaurant, if not to own.  Thanks Lee! [Dry Glass: Grape juice and butterscotch][89/100][Tasted: 3/10/17]"
5.0,"Another sample courtesy of Lee, as part of our tasting team.  I've not had many bourbons, but I feel if they taste like this, I need to replace Scotland with America (and Mexico...been falling in love with Mezcal lately).  I love the complexity in this.  Fruity aromas followed by a some Indian / Asian spices like nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice and cardamom.   This is the whiskey I'd like to keep as a regular go-to dram...really well made.  Thanks to Lee for the sample!"

4.0,"The train taking me on the Scotch Distillery Tour is making a stop in Kentucky. It's possible due to some quantum mechanics coupled with a flux capacitor, very scientific and I won't bore you with the details. Anyways, this Kentucky straight bourbon is aged 6 years in new America oak and then finished for 9 months in French oak barrels that were used to age Cabernet Sauvignon from the Groth Vineyards in Napa Valley, California. It is 45.1% ABV and as all Kentucky straight bourbons are, it is natural color of what I would call deep copper amber. I don't know if it is chill filtered or not. This one is from batch #6. 

Very mint forward initially on the nose, which surprised me. The fruity wine notes take over quickly. Very similar to a port wine finished whisky but with some differences. Oak, vanilla, toffee, caramel and butterscotch make themselves known once the strong wine notes start to subside. There is a corn sweetness typical of most bourbons and then a definite bubblegum note pops in. Brown sugar, cinnamon and clove after it sits in the glass for a while and then some similar spices like mulling spices. I have a small jar of mulling spices so I took a quick sniff, it's similar but not as intense. There is something else as well. Something very nice that I just can't seem to identify. A complex nosing whiskey. 

Mint forward again on the palate. A good strong vanilla note follows the mint. Fruity wine notes and mild oak. There is a rye-like spice to it. I'm not sure if there is rye in the mashbill but that's what it reminds me of. 

Fairly light mouthfeel that is semi dry, but mouthwatering at the same time. Medium long finish that is fruity sweet like blackberries/raspberries with some oak. 

I have to say I was very surprised at how good this bourbon is. This is my first from Jeffersons but it won't be the last. Sweeter and smoother with much more complexity than I expected.  I am really loving these wine finished spirits. I believe this bottle went for around $90, which is high for a bourbon, but a decent price for a good scotch so I would not hesitate to buy a full bottle. One of the only criticisms I have is that I feel bottling at 48% vs 45.1% would have pushed it over the top.   Thanks to Lee for the sample. 4.25. Cheers"

4.75,"I find the Jefferson line to be somewhat hit or miss and find the Pritchard Hill expression (their entry level wine Finished Bourbon) to be just ok. This one however I have been wanting to try as it was finished in the famed Groth Cab Cask (which is the first California Wine to score 100 points from Robert Parker). The other unique aspect to the finishing is that all of the barrels were placed in a ""hot box"" (a steel container that reaches upwards of 120 degrees) with the intent being to extract more wine influence. The resulting Bourbon does not dissapiont. As soon as it hits your pallette it's just an explosion of red fruits with a butterscotch back bone. It's very full bodied and chewy. Mid pallette has some slight spice with toffee and maple leading to a long charred oak driven finish. It's all extremely well integrated. This is the best wine finished Bourbon I have had to date and the first that doesn't taste like someone poured wine in my Whiskey. It's near flawless. The best Jefferson's product I have had to date (easily eclipsing the Oceans and Presidential batches I have sampled). At around $100 a bottle and it being pretty difficult to find, it takes some work to find a bottle. It's worth the search. Cheers all!"
4.75,Good classic Jefferson’s reserve flavor and the groth cask finish adds a lot of great complexity. Lots of fruity and jam like notes. Great well drinking bourbon if you can find it.

5.0,"You guys were right, this is better than the Ocean Aged. Took me a couple of days to get too it (the workload at the office is insane atm....work/sleep repeat, not time for whisky^^) but now I finally can enjoy this outstanding bourbon. 

The nose begins very classic. Corn, vanilla, cherries. The fruits need a bit to get going, but soon notes of strawberries start to become more and more present. Also, dried figs. You know that sugary exterior of those? That's in the smell. Plus some spices. 

Spices are what hits you first when you take a sip. My guess is barrel spice, can't have that much rye in here. Vanilla, cherries and corn are the main notes, but there is also a subtle amount of dried sweet berries in there, plus some fresh grapes. Red ones. 

The aftertaste is spicy with sweet fruits mixed into it. This elevates the Groth above your typical Bourbon in my opinion. Cherries are not that uncommon, but this one takes this particular note and cranks it up to 11. 

Hard to get and not that affordable, but worth it. Might need to hunt down a bottle of this. 

Also, next taste will be 105....and there can only be one candidate for that number."
