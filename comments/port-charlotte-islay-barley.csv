5.0,"First off, excellent value for money. 50%abv, natural color, non-chill filtered, absolutely fantastic. This whisky is youthful, vibrant, fruity, full bodied, briney, salty, and rich. 

Now let's talk about the peat. At 40 ppm,  although high it's nowhere near an ardbeg or laphroaig. I would say it's in between a highland park and ardbeg. It's peaty and you know it definitely there, but never overwhelming the fruity and briney flavours. It's absolutely fantastic. 

My favorite part about this whisky is that the peat flavour is a sweet juicy peat, no dark bbq roasted/rotten meat or vegetal peat. It's just a very clean smokey fruity peat like in caol ila 12. 

It's hard for me to say something bad about this, but I guess the only downside is that it's not terribly complex, as it's pretty young I'm assuming maybe 8yrs avg. But don't let that fool you, it's very good and considering what you're getting vs how much you're paying I'm giving it a 5/5

You'll like this if you like a vibrant, powerful, fruity, clean peat, smokey whisky

Cheers"
4.0,"It was incredibly enjoyable going from a less peaty whiskey for my first drink to this one. The flavor is not simply all peat here, it is full and rich, just how I like it. I bought a bottle, and I'm finding that on a regular basis there is juuuuuust a bit too much peat for me, but it's still extremely good."

4.0,"Approachable complexity.  In the nose is the unmistakable intense aroma of smoked oak. A neat dram reassures you that the smokey aroma was the truth, and is accompanied by generously salted caramel. With an intensely strong finish off peat that almost sounds the tongue. A drop of water opens clarity and rich viscosity with more pronounced flavors of vanilla and apricot to be enjoyed into a smoother oak and peat harmony. This is a thinking man's scotch and I like that about it."

3.0,"It's time for a wonderful whisky tasting flight from the fine lads at Bruichladdich, on the island of Islay.  I'm enjoying the Wee Laddie Tasting Collection from these guys, which contains 3 200ml (8oz) samples of their core offerings:  Classic Laddie, Islay Barley, and Port Charlotte Scottish Barley Heavily Peated.  To run the entire gamut I've also opened a bottle of Octomore 7.1, in a valiant effort to go from unpeated all the way to the most heavily peated whisky in the world.  Okay, let's continue on to taster #2...

Islay Barley is another unpeated single malt that was distilled using only barley that was sourced from different farms around the island.  It's non-chill filtered, no color added and comes in at a familiar 100 proof.  It's a deeper, golden yellow in the glass and makes a lot of skinny legs in the Glencairn tasting glass when you twirl it a bit.

The nose is eerily similar to American bourbon:  there's vanilla, oak and corn sugar that floods the senses right away.  I'm not getting much else.  The first sip is vanilla, toffee and a faint floral dryness.  The oily feel of the Classic Laddie isn't present here.  This tastes like a quality, American bourbon without all the alcohol kick.  This finish is spicy and quick.  There's not even much lingering heat.  

Overall, it's a bit boring and one dimensional for a scotch.  It seems fairly young as well and doesn't leave much of a lasting impression.  I'd say it's in between 3 and 3.5 stars.  Cheers."

3.5,"Octomore's little brother Port Charlotte from Bruichladdich distillery is the peated NAS equivalent of 'The Classic Laddie'. Bottled at 50% ABV, the nose is obviously spirity and slightly rough with vegetal peatiness, brine and creamy citrus. With water, you get unripe banana, pickles and black pepper. Crisp and zesty in the arrival, the taste develops dry and mineral with honeydew melon, herbal spiciness and hints of oak. The finish is lasting and delicate with peat smoke and green tea. Although a bit pricey, it's not bad for a relatively young Islay Single Malt.

4.0,"This whisky greets you with a fresh burst of lemon and beeswax that is complimentary to the signature Islay peat. Honey, vanilla and oak on the palate are also nicely balanced. Gentle cinnamon spice makes an appearance at the finish. Robust yet smooth mouthful considering its 50% ABV bottling. While the finish is relatively short, it is definitely worth the 'trouble' of pouring another dram."

4.0,One of my first peated malts. Still working on picking up the underlying salt and citrus notes
4.0,"Starts with heavy notes of leather that leads into strong peat and some smokiness. Spend a little more time enjoying the aromas and it begins to show you that briny sea salt, almost as if you're at the shore. Then it gets a little sweet. The first hit to the tongue is surprisingly mild and the sweetness can be almost honey-like, but it takes no time at all for the strong peat to come roaring in. After that, the brine is back with some brightness - maybe lemon. A peppery kick to finish will leave your tongue tingling."

4.0,"Color: Natural light gold and several gradations darker and richer looking than fellow islanders, Lagavulin8 and Ardbeg10. Unexpected, given its short 6-year gestation in ex-bourbon American oak. Nose: maneuvering the 50% ABV, surprised to find a citrusy zestfulness and a hint of honeyed vanilla prior to catching the first wave of a raw, earthy peatiness, which evoked memories of slogging the bogs at Royal St. David's in Wales. Using Islay barley grown on 6 local farms, Bruichladdich is pushing the ""terroir"" aspect of their Port Charlotte expression by utilizing local sourcing, distilling, and aging. With a phenolic level of 40 ppm, it was interesting to see this translate into a boggy/vegetal style of peatiness with moderate smokiness. Once the palate survives the onslaught of peppered alcohol, the tongue is rewarded with a sweet dose of vanilla saltwater taffy along with a cascade of citrus fruits, and finishing pleasantly with toasted hints of smoked malted barley. A few drams of this unadulterated spirit will have you hugging the nearest tree, while your wife contemplates having the locks changed before you can get back in.  :)"

3.0,"On a Bruichladdich masterclass I had the opportunity to compare both the Port Charlotte Scottish Barley with the Port Charlotte Islay Barley. While they’re both great drams, I’m now absolutely convinced that terroir matters.
While they’re both obviously very similar, the Islay Barley definitely has the edge here. It’s slightly fresher (nonetheless the peat and smoke), it tastes more nutty, and has a tad more balance in general, but especially in the spices. The Scottish Barley actually appears a bit subdued when compared directly, but I honestly doubt wether I could single one of them out as being distilled with either Scottish or Islay Barly in a general comparison. All in all, they’re both very nice drams!"

4.5,"Nose: The characteristic Bruichladdich distillery musky, dusky, floral character just peeps  through. There are some maritime qualities as well but more than anything it's the aroma of freshly peat-smoked barley that hits you. A strongly smoky and waxy/oily cereal nose.

Palate: A crisp but not aggressive arrival mainly featuring peat smoke and malt. The development brings out more of an oily maritime character, lemon zest and licorice. There's also a sweet nutty quality that I don't think I've noticed before in a Port Charlotte. The palate becomes sweeter over time, but adding water brings out pickles and pepper spice.

Finish: Long and smoky with some invigorating hot spicy notes (cinnamon? ginger?) and a seashore mineral quality, like wet sand or rocks, and a touch of tannin (but no bitterness).

There is an interesting comparison to be made with Port Charlotte 10 Year Old Second Edition and with Bruichladdich Islay Barley (which is the direct unpeated equivalent from this distillery). There are many similarities but this expression shares a bright, spicy and definitely nutty profile with the BIB that is not in the PC10. The PC10 is more rounded and has delightful honey and fruit notes that don't appear here or in the BIB.  Whether these differences are due to different barley - who knows? The nuttiness may well be due to the Islay barley, but I'd think the other differences are more to do with maturation and a greater cask influence on the PC10/2nd.

An enjoyable whisky, which I'm rating slightly higher than the Bruichladdich Rockside Farm Islay Barley 2007, but lower than the Port Charlotte 10YO Second Edition. At the asking price this is a very good dram.

Tasted at a Sydney whisky shop Bruichladdich tasting evening, 19 Feb 2018.

The nose is surprising—cinnamon bread, iodine, dried orange peel, and the striking scent of fresh thyme (oily, savory, and floral sweet all at once). The palate follows well, and I get impressions of crisp gala apples, moist mellow pipe tobacco, orange–vanilla cream, and grilled fruit. A smoky and sweet tobacco-like finish with an impeccable alcohol burn lingers on the palate. The mouthfeel is simultaneously oily and cleansing. This is an afternoon dram, one that enlivens and refreshes the senses."
