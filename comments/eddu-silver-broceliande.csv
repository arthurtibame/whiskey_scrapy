3.25,"Damn! I used to think this was the worst whisky I've ever had, but it's really grown on me! Either it's mellowed out a bit after the 2 years since being opened or maybe it's my growing appreciation of various types of whisky (bourbon in particular) that has broadened my palate? Probably a bit of both since I was mostly an unpeated Scotch drinker prior to trying this whisky for the first time. Now that I've fallen in love with bourbon and peated Scotch I can finally enjoy Eddu Silver. This is not a beginners whisky. It is intense, complex and very different from any other whisky I've ever had. 
To think I nearly gave this bottle away after trying it for the first time!"
