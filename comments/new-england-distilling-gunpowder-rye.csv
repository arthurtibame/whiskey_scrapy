nose: Jasmine, rubber, petroleum, vanilla, caramel, cinnamon

rough and a little sweet, one of the better Maine whiskeys, but not something I would go out of my way to drink"

3.0,"Very interesting.  Sweet, I didn't find it too rough.  A pronounced almost chapstick-like flavor.  Not in an unpleasant way.  Not sure if I'll buy it again, but it was interesting for sure!"
