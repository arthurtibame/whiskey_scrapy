4.0,"What a nice surprise this one turned out to be! For an everyday price of $13 (and often on sale for less) this is one of the best bargains I've found of late. Finally decided to give it a try after the ""rebranding"" with upgraded packaging and cork closure. Pleasant nose with sweet vanilla and oak, balanced with a nice leathery note. Sweet upfront on the palate, followed by baking spices before transitioning to oak on the back end. Slightly clingy leaving honey, vanilla and mint with a little char on the palate after a smooth warming finish. This bests EW Black and JB White for a few dollars less. It is even approaching EW BIB territory for me (which is really saying something). This is definitely going to become a staple in my cabinet. A solid 3.5, but I'll round up."

5.0,"This is the 80 proof version.  Cherries, lemon, vanilla, grain on the nose.  Cherries, cool fruitiness on the tongue.  Super smooth and cool.  Surprisingly good and tasty.   This is a regular on my bar and high on my favorite list. The more I drink it, the better it gets. It won't over take my favorite, but it's a great bourbon at the price point.   A great all day sipper.  This is not the same as Tennessee Whiskey, even though it's sour mash and charcoal filtered.  It lacking the sugar maple mint flavor that Tennessee whiskey has.  It's still very good and much cheaper than Tennessee whiskey."

2.0,"Not bad, not great; decent value for a sour mash in the low $20s.  Most of the flavors/scents were masked by strong alcohol until I added some water.  After that, I picked up quite a bit of wood and citrus on the nose.  Hints of vanilla and spice on my tongue, but nothing too complex.  Michter's sour mash is definitely more interesting, but it's also almost double the cost, so that's expected."

4.0,"With whiskey, it seems rare to get more than that for which you've paid, which is why this dram is a bit of a rarity. It's not great, but for $15 USD, it is more than serviceable.  

On the nose, at first it presents vanilla and a bit of ethanol, but after 10 minutes or so, it brings grain, creamed corn, and wood to the party. 

On the palate, it starts sweet with vanilla and marshmallow cream, and tends toward oaky mid palate with some baking spice. The finish is short with a smidgen of tannin bitterness. 

All in all, it is an okay dram. It's just not as complex or challenging as some more premium bourbons.  It's easy drinking (crushable) neat, and also works well in cocktails. 

Weighing price into the evaluation, I give this 85 points for a scant four stars, since 3.5 isn't available. This is certainly worth picking up if you need a cheap but solid bourbon on hand to make Old Fashionds or Whiskey Sours for guests."

4.0,"I won't bore you with the notes this passes the nose with or how many different kinds of flavors this quality, basic bourbon presents.  Such things are really too subjective to bother with for someone new to this product's party.  I will, however, note that for the money you simply cannot do better.  For $20 you get 1.75L of burnt caramel goodness and you will not regret it.  Just add a splash of a decent mineral water or two to open things up (hey, you're on the cheap, go for the Dasani across the shop) and you have a great sip for a few pennies a glass.  Doing so, you get a very good bourbon with much of the same qualities that you find in higher priced bottles as such mellows the fire that comes with a younger age.  Is this as good as Four Roses Small Batch?  No.  But, with a bit of limestone filtered water tossed in, it's not as far off as you'd think."

Body- The orange zest sweetness comes through first, then baking spices of cinnamon and clove. Finally a strong black pepper bite finishes the sip. These three flavors get progressively stronger.
Finish- Short. The black pepper fades to some floral grass notes and finally an oaty sweetness. 

Nice overall. Finish is a bit weak but nice flavors in the body. Definitely a spicy bourbon."

4.0,"Appearance: The color I notice in this bourbon is a yellow gold, lighter than what I was expecting but probably due to the charcoal filtering. It has very thin but viscous legs that hold on for dear life to the edge of the glass.

Nose: The nose has no alcohol punch but instead welcomes you with notes of caramel apples, toffee, oak, wildflowers, corn, and powdered candy, friendly to say the least.

Taste: The palate is crazy smooth and delicious, almost dangerously so. I find notes of roasted nuts, charred meat, baking spices, baked apple, and banana bread with nuts.

Finish: The finish is very nice. It’s medium in length with a buttered cinnamon toast note to end the sip.

Thoughts: I honestly didn’t know what to expect from this whiskey, but I am so very glad our paths crossed! This charcoal filtered bourbon (almost a Tennessee whiskey) was so delicious and was very well rounded without being boring. I’ve had it neat and also had some in a mint julep and both experiences were great! If you like Jack Daniels you will definitely like this! I highly recommend it and would buy this again easily. I also want to try it’s rye sister and see how that measures up. Luxco, nice work on this one! Cheers!"

2.5,"My sister came to visit over the President's day weekend and she is a big fan of the Old No7. Reading the reviews on here about this one and how it's a better smoother charcoal mellowed Whiskey, that also happens to be cheaper. It also never hurts to keep a bottom shelf mixing option on hand! On to the review.
On the pallette it's pretty soft and light with vanilla being the dominant note with may a hint of cider. Mid palatte is more of the same with only some cinnamon spice on the end adding to the simple and straight forward profile. It's uncomplicated and easy to drink. For her purposes of Whiskey and Coke it proved a very worthy mixer. For my purposes of a neat pour, I'd probably pass again. Many other bottom shelf options I would drink over this (OF 86, WT 81 or even Two Stars). For $13 it's a solid value just don't expect much more than a $13 Whiskey! Cheers all!"

3.0,"OK let’s get a couple things out-of-the-way. This is a budget price bottom shelf bourbon, secondly I was told I have become somewhat of a bourbon snob (an accolade typically reserved for scotch drinker’s LOL). so can a “bourbon snob” enjoy a bourbon for under $15, if it’s this bourbon I can.

Now make no mistake, you can’t compare this bourbon to your standard in the $25 or above price range, it is what it is. There is plenty of butter and peanuts with lots of vanilla in the body. It lacks the smoothness and fuller body mouth feel, and there is a little bit of the “twang” on the finish. When you compare this to other bourbons in this price range, this one stands out - it’s good."

4.0,"Giving it a 4.0 due to the combination of taste profile & price. At $12.99 you cannot go wrong with this bourbon (though some here have gotten it for as little as $9.99). It can definitely be enjoyed neat & not ""just as a mixer"". It's a light shade of gold in color, with a perfumy nose and a light-bodied mouth-feel. There is a depth of character but not as bold as something like Buffalo Trace or Larceny. Finish is long and satisfying.

Again you have to consider the price on this dram. Once you cross over the $20 mark, I think you're in different territory and a comparison to Evan Williams Single Barrel, Jim Beam Distillers Cut, Buffalo Trace etc, is not appropriate. Enjoy it for what it is...at the very least if you have friends come by, you can serve something they'll enjoy without breaking the bank!"
3.75,"The nose is bitter. Tea leaves, wood, and honey.

Body tastes of sweet tea and cinnamon. Good, clean, and simple.

Finish is cinnamon and cedar.

I like this bourbon. It’s basic, but it delivers value for money. Might be third place now in this category below BT and Four Roses."

null,"Nose: It’s got this yeasty dough thing going on at first, but then the cocktail peanuts, sweet corn, and coconut step up. For me, after a couple minutes of getting used to the nose, Arizona’s Honey Green Tea came on strong. In no way is this off putting or reminiscent of anything crappy. Considering I picked this up for $9.99, I was happily surprised.

Palate: Palate is a little thin, but there is absolutely no burn at 90 proof. You can tell this is some young stuff. All the flavors kind of remind me of a beer mash. However, you get some good nuttiness. There is also a cool sparkly and fizzy feel. 

Finish: Creamy coconut on the tail end, but quite a short finish. There isn’t much to write home about. But, you’re talking about a $10.00 bourbon here. You can’t complain, and it out performs its price point for sure. 

I feel very strongly this is from Heaven Hill, and no wonder I like it. Solid outing for Luxco."

2.75,"Venturing back into bottom shelf land I picked this up because I loved Ezra Brooks 7 year 101 offering that is, sadly, no longer available in this area. For $11 I figured it would at least make a decent mixer. I wasn’t wrong. 

This is your basic budget bourbon. It’s made by the Lux Row Distillery in Bardstown KY. It’s a straight bourbon so it’s at least two years old, I’d guess maybe 4-5. It’s bottled at 45% ABV, is a medium amber in the glass and forms sparse fat legs when given a swirl. It’s charcoal filtered after aging rather than before like Jack Daniels. 

The nose is a standard bourbon profile: caramel, vanilla, and a hint of cinnamon. Nothing special. The palate is similar but had a bit of an acetone note that prevents this from being an acceptable sipper. The finish is actually the best part of this whiskey with warm baking spices, oak char, and a bitter wood note. 

For $11 it’s not bad and makes a good mixer. Can’t quite recommend it as a neat sipper, but may not be bad on the rocks. 2.75/5. Cheers!"

3.0,"Recent discussion in a local whiskey Facebook group, Arizona Whiskey Community, on the subject of underrated bottles reminded me of this gem.
Ezra Brooks comes from Lux Row Distillers, many times referred to as Luxco. 
At this time the label is widely believed to be sourced from Heaven Hill, though Luxco has not officially confirmed nor denied this.
The label proclaims the bourbon is ""charcoal mellowed,"" which is similar to Evan Williams' ""charcoal filtered"" language on their label. Unlike the Lincoln County Process for Tennessee Whiskey, the charcoal filtering here occurs before bottling instead of prior to barreling and aging.
Lux Row officially opened their own distillery in Bardstown, Kentucky and filled the first barrel with their distillate on January 10th, 2018. Using a 43-foot custom copper still, they have the capacity to produce 3 million gallons per year.
I've initially held off purchasing a bottle due to gimmicky language on the label: ""aged the old fashioned way,"" what does that even imply?! After picking up and tasting my first bottle, this has convinced me not to judge whiskey simply based on dubious label language alone. Consequently, this bottle can also be blamed on me trying some subpar whiskey in search of the next affordable gem.
Oak char on the nose with nuts, caramel, and hint of mint. On the palate there's oak, black cherry, almond toffee, and leather. Finish starts off sweet and ends with black pepper spice."

Flavor initially reminded me of burnt wood (but in an unpleasant way) or toothpaste.  After a while, it sweetened a touch, but the mouthfeel is quick and it's somewhat all-around watery for 90-proof.  After a while, I am noticing more and more that it drinks a bit like young, cheap scotch, with none of the character of corn or sweetness that I am used to getting from Bourbon.  

For the price, an interesting pour, but definitely not a good one."

3.0,"There are a bunch of us old retired guys that get together once a week for breakfast at our local IHOP. I mentioned in one of my earlier reviews that a good friend of mine said I was a bourbon snob, today I asked him what he meant. He said you just don’t drink the bottom shelf like most of us who are on a fixed income. I reminded him I just picked up this bottle of Ezra Brooks and I think it’s a real decent bourbon. Well this became a pretty lively conversation for a bunch of old guys eating pancakes, but we did come to a consensus. 

To qualify as a bottom shelf bourbon it had to be under $15 a bottle. We felt there was an additional category that we called “great value” bourbon in the $15-$25 price range. These Bourbons are noticeably better than those that typically occupy the bottom shelf, Wild Turkey 101 is a prime example. 

What does all this rambling have to do with the review of Ezra Brooks? Well your perception is your reality, if you don’t think you can find anything decent on the bottom shelf... you won’t. This Ezra is a real decent bourbon, I can find this all day long for under $15. This is a daily drinker for a lot of my friends, their budget just won’t allow them to venture too far out of this price range. 

So as a result this “Old Dude” has decided to leave the comfort of his mid shelf and dive back into the bottom shelf from time to time. They say there’s gold in them there hills, this bottle of Ezra is proof of that."
4.0,"The best of the budget bourbons that I have tried.  Delicious caramel, vanilla, brown sugary flavor with sandalwood in the mix too.  Beats out Evan Williams for my new go to value bourbon."

3.5,One of the best of the bottom shelf. It loses a little bit in complexity it probably had due to the mellowing of the charcoal filter in both nose and taste but it's still got that recognizable straight bourbon smell and taste if just a little muted. Don't let the low price steer you off trying this one as it's as good or better of some of the other sourced bourbons that get passed off at $25-$50 a bottle

3.5,"Before I give my opinion, we need to clear a few things up: First and foremost — WHY isn't this listed higher on the spicy index? The alcohol bite is something that is felt throughout the entirety of each sip, but it's not too bad after the first sip.

Secondly, why the hell are people complaining about this bourbon having a ""nail polish remover"" nose? I mean, I understand it, but what I'm really asking is why they're writing a tasting note after the first few sips, especially soon after a pour? I noticed the strong alcohol scent, too, but I gave it a little bit and took an insane amount of sips before writing this. Give it some time to air out a little — it's almost half alcohol. I had the same experience with Bulleit and Wild Turkey for crying out loud before figuring out I needed to let the vapor air out.

MY TASTING NOTE: A rough bottom shelf bourbon, Ezra Brooks is a diamond in the rough. Once it's aired off, it's kind of sweet on the nose. I drank it neat out of a brandy glass and swirled it a ton over about 30 minutes to an hour. It takes a while, so be patient. Plenty of spicy vanilla and caramel on the palate. Medium length sweet toasted corn, oaky and peppery finish. Each sip made my upper lip very tingly, but it wasn't bad.

I give it a 3.5/5 because it DOES take a while to air out when Wild Turkey 101 is enjoyable the entire time, but I will say that it goes quite well in mixed drinks. I tried it with a bourbon, lemon, and tonic (BLT) and — wouldn't you know — I don't like tonic but this was a damn good drink. Confident that this will be my go-to mixer instead of Evan Williams from now on."

4.0,"Sweet dusty corn with a hint of cherry. Not too complex, but punchy. Slight lingering finish. My go to budget sipper."
3.5,"For a bourbon, most of which I'm not partial to, this is quite acceptable and delightful! It is several parts sweet and vanilla and sour and citrus and I sort of get the sandalwood overtones but not really. Fairly complex for what I'm thinking is only a notch or two above an entry-level bourbon?

The tartness blends with the wood making it quite delightful! It does remind me of Maker's Mark to some extent. Perhaps that's why I like it more than most ordinary Bourbons. And it doesn't burn on the finish like many popular but terrible ""Budweiser of bourbon""  brands."

3.0,"Nose... Apples, marshmallows, and raisins lead the way with just a subtle hint of alcohol on the back end...

Appearance... Falls between a light to medium amber...

Taste... Significantly sweet butterscotch and vanilla come through at first. Followed by pepper, tobacco and a slight pear hint which is faint yet welcoming...

Overall... If this were sold at a higher proof it would definitely be a gigantic steal. The bottle could easily find it's way into my cheaper rotation when the price is as low as I found this one to be...

0.5,The best thing this bourbon has going for it is the price. If you like alcohol burn and no flavor then this is the whiskey for you. This will be good to have in your collection for that person that comes over and wants a whiskey and coke.

2.5,"What am I missing on this one?  I can’t get past the rough heat. Comes quick and stays. Starts to develop some flavor but quickly is all heat (not due to proof). For the price it’s not horrible, but I’d spend a few bucks and get Evan Williams black label."
3.0,"A golden yellowish hue, a little past straw.
Nose reveals youth and a hint of grassiness. A bit of heat, and a little rough around the edges, but the hallmark notes are there. Some honeysuckle, light toast, vanilla and notable hints of rye grain and corn. 
Thin mouthfeel carries some heat on the sides of the tongue. 
Got to admit nothing really jumps out... Barrel char comes through on the finish.  Some sticky burnt caramel as well.
Definitely young, and a bit hot, but it's a bargain at 15 bucks, and can certainly be drank neat."

2.75,"Had a hard time enjoying this one neat. A little harsh and just straight sandalwood both in the nose and on the tongue. It took an ice cube to be able to find the underlying classic bourbon flavors (they are there!). At $14 it is what it is, better than most anything else at this price range."
2.75,"Lately it seems I haven't wanted to do much contemplating or pondering of my whiskies, but rather to drink a cheap bourbon at about a 4:5 whiskey to Coke ratio.  Well with all of the time off amid Covid-19 mania I've gotten just that opportunity.  I picked up a 1.75L bottle of this Kentucky straight bourbon for a paltry $30.  It's bottled at 45%ABV, chill filtered and a natural color of orange copper.  Add in a 2 L of Coke and some ice and it's off to the races.  Towards the end of the bottle I figured I better take a couple nights to give it the old glencairn treatment and see what's what.   

The nose begins with some dusty peanut shells, corn, rye and mint.  There's lots of cinnamon, but more like cinnamon red hot candies, and butterscotch.  Orange peel, a little brown sugar and vanilla.  Charred oak and a bit of burnt marshmallows.  A very faint banana pudding, almonds, cherries and peanut brittle.  A fairly typical bourbon profile, but not really that of a quality one.

The palate starts off as cinnamon, again more like the sugary red hots or even that of Fireball rather than the actual spice.  Corn must and apples.  Not like fresh apples, but more like apples that your kids have left out for a few hours and they're all brown and oxidized now.  Charred oak, a touch spicy and dusty.  At times there is an unpleasant acetone note, but thankfully this is not very often or long lasting.  An artificial banana flavor, maraschino cherries and vanilla.

A medium-light bodied mouthfeel that is on the thin side and  mouthwatering.
The finish is medium long with more of those dry apples, oak and vanilla.

This is a very simple, young, and slightly rough bourbon, but that's kind of to be expected with a budget bourbon. Having said that, I would absolutely take the Evan Williams Black Label over this one in the budget bourbon category.  It works fairly well when paired with Coke, but again, the EW does that even better, despite the lower ABV.  The whiskey is worth a 2.5, maybe even a little lower, but the value will bump it to 2.75.
Cheers"

4.0,"How did I not review this already? I will join the chorus, this is absolutely one of the best buys in bourbon. Bottom shelf pricing, but flavor approaching the top tier. It is everything a dependable bourbon should be: the corn sweetness balanced with the rye , some barrel char, a hint of old leather and a little brown sugar. At 90 proof it holds up well in cocktails, and is smooth enough to sip neat. No, not as complex as the true top tier bourbons; but, at 25% of the price, what reasonable person could argue."
