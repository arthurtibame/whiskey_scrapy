5.0,"This is not the same review of the present Old Rip Van Winkle 10yo, this one is from a 1990's bottle or early 2000's; the shape of the bottle is actually different, very rectangular while the present bottle is ""kinda rounded"". 

The abv of this one is exactly the same, 53.5%abv, but the aromas and flavors are different. Which one is better? Lets see....

On the nose: Metalic; Copper note, typical of Pappy's bourbons. Banana, Prunes. Stinky metal. Steel. Slight cherry notes. 
Vanilla; After first sip spent matches and Brown sugar notes appear. Very interesting.

On the palate: Banana, Spice pepper, Vanilla but very Refined. Burning Hay smoke.

Aftertaste is excelent. Vanilla, Banana split, ice cream. Spices like Wasabi and Metalic notes. 

Overall this is also a great bourbon whiskey, but in comparison to the present one is a little different, and i prefer the one from this days. 97 out of 100, great whiskey."
