5.0,"One of my top three scotch (3/2014).  Super smooth, big legs, and great on the nose."
4.0,"The Nose:  Deep dessert wine notes, with juicy raisins, orange marmalade, and caramel that’s just a touch burnt. Lesser notes of bruised apples, black cherry, and dark chocolate.

The Palate:  Sweet, pleasantly syrupy entry with quite of bit of orange citrus, black cherry, burnt caramel, and vanilla bean to start. This sweetness transitions gracefully into a terrific swell of rich, tannic oak. More cinnamon stick and raw cedar wood with clove, nutmeg and baker’s chocolate.

The Finish:  Wonderfully lengthy, sweet and dry, with more black cherry, cedar-y, spicy tannins, and unsweetened cocoa."

Taste: Honey and malt in a sweet way, with oak in the back. Full and layered body of raisins, oranges and delicate sherry.

Finish: Textures of very dark flavors. Dried fruits with dark chocolate, espresso and a little bit of smoke.

Balance: Rich and sophisticated dram!"
4.0,"So good. I was super glad I decided I spend a little more than usual and try this whiskey. This was my first Japanese whiskey and I was pleasantly surprised! I like a little sweet sometimes, and this hit the spot without feeling too heavy -- it was just kinda refreshing to drink."

5.0,Found one of the last few bottles left at Narita on my home from a trip (only $140!). Yeah...it's stupid good as the kids say. Caramel sweetness rolling over a medium-body with a touch of spice as she slides down. It's sex in a bottle.

It goes in slightly sweet, slightly spicy, betraying the sherry casking. Succinct finish, nothing oily, and very polite. Well-rounded, always mellow, never harsh. Increasingly pricy worldwide... even at Narita (officially ¥25000)."

5.0,"PRICE: Very hard to find.  Government stores may have this as a lottery item at $250.  Last time I saw this in a private store, it was $700.
    INFO: Single malt whisky from Japan aged 18 years in sherry, mizunara, and American oak.  43% ABV
    DISCLAIMER: My entire experience with this whisky is based on 1oz pour at $70, and as a part of a blind tasting flight with Glendronach 18 year and Macallan 18 year sherry oak.
    
    NOSE: 95/100.  Powerful rich sherry notes followed by an intoxicating line-up of subtler notes.  A perfect balance between spirit and wood.  Fruits: plums and raisins.  Herbs: rosemary and eucalyptus.  A little smoked cherry wood and leather.
    
    PALATE: 99/100.  Perfection.  I was not prepared to be moved by a beverage.  If I was more of an emotional creature, a tear would have fallen down my cheek and added some saltiness.  Salt is the only flavor missing.  Fireworks containing every other flavor you can imagine.  Perfect body.  Slick as OPEC oil.
    
    FINISH: 95/100.  Long and rewarding.  Stone fruits, green tea, and tobacco.
    
    OVERALL: When Jim Murray awarded Yamazaki the whisky of the year and thus tried to divide the Japanese whisky industry by 0, I was too busy still exploring Scotch to bother.  Now that I am trying Japanese whiskies, they have not lived up to the hype, except for Yamazaki.  This is deservedly a slayer of worlds, and a Scotch killer.  In my blind tasting, I got all 3 whiskies correctly.  Glendronach and Macallan were lovely, but comparing them to Yamazaki is like comparing a picture of the Grand Canyon to the Grand Canyon.
    
    MARK: 97/100.
    VALUE FOR PRICE: I don’t like the secondary market markup.  At $250, it is completely worth it.  At $500+, it’s a judgment call.  I do want to say this: If I won a shot to buy a bottle for $250, I would not resell for $500.  I would drink this shit."

There's orange marmalade and figs coupled with cinnamon and dark chocolate, both on the nose and palate. It's incredibly balanced and well-crafted, with a finish that is quite prolonged and smooth in a way that only a perfect dram could be.

4.75,"Smell from the bottle, and it's almost rum like, smell in the glass and a whiskey forms. Use a pipette if you can, add 1/4 a drop of clean water before every small sip... This magic changes and takes you through a wealth of flavour, look out for fig, and date, and nuts and spices, look out for all of the 'wonderful' that the sherry casks and bourbon barrels have brought this beautiful liquid. Absolutely one of the best ways to spend an hour with 50ml of whiskey. Take the chance if you can"

5.0,"Rich, sweet nose.  The best comparison I could think of is honey butter or butterscotch, where the sweetness was backed by a deep richness. 
The rich sweetness was backed by a very slight smoky note and a slight fruity note. The palate had a sweet fruity taste at the very beginning, reminiscent of figs.  The fruit lingered at the front of the tongue.  The whiskey then gave way to a low to medium spiciness, and a wonderful oakiness.  This oakiness filled the mouth and was long on the finish.  It tasted like the inside of a barrel in the best way - rich, oaky, and sweet.  Yet, it was not overpowering. It was very pleasant. The mouth feel was full and oily.  Both mouthwatering and mouthcoating.  Finish was exceptionally smooth.  Comparable only to the pappy 20 and the George t stagg fall 2013 in quality for me."

5.0,"Nose - Rich chocolaty malt, dark toffee, sweet leather, sweet tobacco

Taste - Gentle ginger/white pepper tingle/heat, dark toffee, dark chocolate, lightly sweet dark prunes/figs, charred orange peel, lightly drying mouthfeel reminiscent of freshly oiled leather & sweet tobacco bitterness

Finish - Long lingering gentle tingle, sweet fades fairly quickly but leaves a very pleasant dark chocolate and dark toffee ""ghost sweet"", caramel, hint of dark fruits

Score - 97/100

Final Thoughts - I really hate to hype this bottle up, but this is just a really really well put together whisky. For something that's only 43% the nose is perfectly balanced where there is little to no ethanol burn, but it's a very rich/oily almost ozone like thickness that's like a very pleasant cologne. This continues to the mouthfeel too where it feels nice & oily, very rich, but isn't overwhelming & just feels perfectly balanced to drink neat. There is this tiny bit of bitterness but it's not off-putting at all and complements the subtle sweetness of the dram. The finish is long lasting & although it's not a syrupy sweet like some heavily sherried drams, it leaves just a whisp of sweet on your tongue, making you want to take another sip.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes, if it's not obnoxiously overpriced

Would I buy a bottle? - Yes"

This is fantastic! 

I don’t have full details on how this whiskey is made and there are some things (like the 43% abv) that chap my ass. Even just bumping it to 46% would make a difference. But still there is some magic going on with the cask work here. Sherry + Mizunara + American oak = deliciousness for all!"

4.5,"Sweet fermentation on the nose. You definitely get some grain. On the palate, you get some light smoke right at the end. The body is smooth as butter and full of flavor. This whisky’s primary flavor is the grain. And that’s just fine with me, because I love barley."

2.75,"A sample gifted by bourbonjosh24.

Nose:  Sweet with some sherry funk, dark berries, a little bit of smoke, some herbal notes, and a background yeasty smell.

Flavor:  Sweet with dark berries and caramelized sugars.  More yeasty funky sherry notes.  Light oak up front.

Finish:  Heavy oak with some more light smokey notes and just a little bit of barrel spice.

Overall I liked this but wouldn't seek it out.  A little too mild for me or rather I found the smoke to be out of balance and too forward masking the sherry notes that I ordinarily really enjoy.  For an 18 year aged product I think maybe this needed more time in barrel and less smoke."

4.5,"Whisky making as an art - that's the essence of whisky-dō, or 'the way of whisky'. No other Japanese Single Malt reflects this philosophy better than Yamazaki 18. An endless potpourri of flavors overwhelms the nose: luscious, heavy sherry notes, pipe tobacco and sour plums; polished wood, leather and raspberries. The palate offers exotic wood spices, dark chocolate, dried fruits and hints of eucalyptus. Roasted coffee, mild orange zest and a touch of Mizunara oak mark the prolonged finish. An outstanding malt that has become shockingly expensive.

5.0,"Hard to get a whiskey to taste better than this. This was one of my personal favorite bottles to date. It’s full, flavorful, smoky, smooth, tangy, with super long and complex taste profile. It’s superb. Unfortunately, it’s price has skyrocketed over the past 10 years. Don’t think too many bottles deserve the $1k price tag, including this one. I could stock up on 3 great bottles instead of this bottle."

4.25,"I waited too long to finally taste this dram. I even have an unopened bottle in my house that i leave it that way since the price went berserk and you can find it in some stores up to $1000. 

Really i think i expected a mind-blowing, award winning, new top 1, but this was not it for me. Dont get me wrong, this is a great dram, i just don't think it is what i was expecting. 

Bottled at 43% beautiful chesnut color.

On the nose, it was perfect. Incredibly sweet: Orange, Cotton candy. Thick Sugar but the one that is left after you drink a cup of coffee and there is this little sugar in the bottom of the cup. Orange hard candy.
Some sherry after letting it breath.

After a perfect score on the nose i got excited for what was coming, palate and aftertaste but it didn't live to the promise of the aroma. 

On the palate: A little watery. A little spicy.
Very smooth., Caramel. There is a dim sherriness. There is a fruitiness like a speysider whisky but all too smooth and easy. 

I call this the curse of fancy whiskies. There is nothing off putting, ""au contraire"" they are delicious and too smooth. But in my book, that is not so interesting. 

Finish is short with a ginger finish and chocolate with salt but very dim.

Overall this is a good dram. Many will love it. I just dont find it too interesting. 85 over 100 is fair for it, i would not pay $1000 not even $300 for it, but at least i got it out of my whisky bucket list. I believe it is too ""soft""."
5.0,"Was lucky enough to have a friend bring this over. The bottle was close to being gone, about 15% left. Current price $700+ GEEEEZ

Awards: World Whiskey 2018 Gold. International spirits challenge Double Gold. SF Spirit Challenge Best in Show, etc etc.

GC. Didn't let it breath, too excited

N(5): Delightful. Maybe low in the bottle or I can handle the proof now, but I can stick my whole nose. It's not bold or punchy. Instead rounded and gentle. You definitely get a of flavors and it evolves. Thing I was able to pick out. Dried ginseng. Condensed honey syrup. Those dried Asian prunes without the sourness. Hint of wood and peat. Vanilla powder. Caramel. Wood spice.
P(4.75): Like the nose this baby evolved. Flavor wise I can't complain. Mirrors the nose. The only other note was some hints of milk chocolate. Not perfect because I wanted more punch. I think if this was elevated in proof a little bit, it would be amazing for me.
F(5): No hug but this think is long finish. A lot of woody notes. Dried out wood that has been baked next to a blueberry, raspberry, boysenberry pie.

Overall: I'm so glad I had the opportunity to try this. I would definitely buy it if I can afford it. Just need to wait til supply comes back. I think the MSRP on this bottle was $250-300."

Hint of sherry hint of  Mizunara, nothing overwhelms, all melds & balances for a unique freshness. 
The nose is incredibly delicious
There is a sweetness to it
I am seriously intrigued.
The palate OMG Toffee, Honey, apples...
Finish is long & fruity much like the palate"
4.75,"Nose- Fig jam, mizunara oak, apples, oranges, buttered pastries, truffles, caramel, apricots

Palate- strawberry jam, honey, caramel covered apples, raisins, mizunara oak, blackberries

Finish- long, creamy finish with notes of honey, sweet apples, and a bit of spice


The world famous Yama 18. The nose is outstanding, with different kinds of sweet jams, unmistakable mizunara oak, sweet fruits, pastries, the list goes on and on. The initial hit on the palate is that of sweet strawberry jam and honey sweetness. Apples take over the palate and move on to a sherry forward profile, rounding out to a long finish with spice, honey, and sweet apples once again. This stuff is delicious. Would be a 5/5 no doubt in my mind if it wasn’t $500+."
