2.0,"Not bad for a bottom-shelf bourbon (running around $13 in my area) that is marginally good enough to sip neat (for less $, Benchmark is better neat)... I tend to let mine sit for a little bit to decrease the acetone/alcohol nose. After sitting, it is sweet with the vanilla and toffee, but has a bit of mineral aftertaste (wet stone) on the finish. I ended up ""vatting"" a bottle of this with some 90 proof Ezra Brooks (that lacked sweetness) and the initial result turned the mineral taste to a soapy taste (yuck!). However, after a few weeks together, the soapiness was gone and the combo worked quite well."
3.0,Not a bad bottom shelf pour. I actually find this more palatable than Heaven Hills' Evan Williams Green or Black label. Not complex and heavy on the char but there are no objectionable notes here. For around $10 it's a decent pour.

2.0,"This was $19.99 for a 1.75 liter.  I thought it was worth a try, but I was wrong.  The aroma coming out of my glass singed my nose hairs a bit.  The tast was rather bland for how strong the alcohol smelled.  My quest for a bottom shelf daily drinker continues, as this is not the cheap bourbon for me."

2.75,Light in body. Light caramel and vanilla notes. Not bad for a $14 Liter bottle. Would make a good mixer.
3.25,Tastes young and with a bit of bite... sort of hints of popcorn and pears... finish is a long burn with a vanilla trace... for. the price it is surprisingly... adequate.

2.5,"I was at a local whiskey tasting event and near the end of the evening, I found myself at the Heaven Hill kiosk.  This Henry McKenna was one of the samples. We had some good discussions about the whiskey lineup they were providing and in talking about this pour I mentioned that this is not sold in our area, which they did acknowledge to be true.  So, before close, they handed me the 2/3 full bottle of this and Rittenhouse for me to take home.  So now I can properly take my time and truly taste (amongst a bunch of other different goodies.)

The mash I’ll is comprised of 
75% corn, 13% rye, 12% barley all aged for about years. 

Caramel color which brings with it a nose that is very straight forward sweetness: caramel, corn, vanilla.  A damp, mustiness is mixed in with the sweetness; like a old barn on a fall, damp day.  Cinnamon notes are lightly apparent.  Acetone seeps through as you draw in the aromas. 

The body is extremely thin.  What is delivered is caramel, vanilla and corn.  Cinnamon spice starts to appear towards and into the finish.  Not much in flavor variety. 

The finish is oak and spice, vanilla and caramel all lasting for a medium length. 

This is about as straightforward as a bourbon goes. Affordable as I see it retails for under $20 (more in the $15 range). Sips extremely easy.  Simple as simple gets.  This is probably geared for mixing than sipping. Easy, simple, enjoyable, approachable. [82/100][Tasted: 3/23/19]"
4.5,"smooth up front, peaty on the back"
2.5,Lots of dusty grain on the nose. Heat on the finish. An inordinate amount of heat for the Proof.
3.0,"By Heaven Hill. An 80 proof, younger version of Evan Williams. Solid, inexpensive bourbon."

3.0,"Not bad at all for a handle of whiskey that goes for $20.  Very smooth if you add a touch of water.  Sweet vanilla flavor typical of almost any bourbon.  I wouldn't quite call it peaty, but there is a funky mustiness to it that must be what gives this whiskey the reputation of being an 'old man's whiskey.'   I'd give it 80/100.  Good enough whiskey on the cheap."

3.0,"Sweet, corn whiskey nose with some light barrel char notes (caramel, vanilla, butter scotch) and sawdust. Slight creaminess on the palate at first that develops into a dry oakiness. Surprisingly oily for 80 proof. The longer its held, the more a peppery rye flavor develops. Swallow too soon and the dry oakiness gets you in the back corners of your mouth with a raw, green woodiness that reveals the immaturity of this bourbon.

It's not the best sipper, but it's an easy drinker that would probably be good for someone looking to switch from drinking bourbon on the rocks to neat. It's pretty light and not overly complex. No big bold flavors so it's not likely to offend."

3.75,"For a bottom shelf price this bourbon offers many nuances and wonderful flavor notes. there is old leather, spice, caramel, dark fruit, a little vanilla, I don't get the smoke that Tango observed. But,that is what makes this so fun. Not a top shelf bourbon, but really good for the price point."

3.0,"As a Heaven Hill product, there’s not a damn thing wrong with this simple “mixing Bourbon.”  Long on sweet corn and light caramel overtones, for $10 I’d put this up against Beam, Jack Green, or other more expensive base offerings. T.S. not the equal of their 10 year old Bond, but other than the comparatively light proof (80), it is better than most in this super cheap pricepoint."

3.0,A solid bourbon for $10. A good cheapy to have on hand. It’s has a thick mouth feel and full. Notes of sweet vanilla on the front with a hint of spice in the back. Has a nice burn that you like from a bourbon. Tastes hotter than 40%.

2.5,"Visit to the magnificent Total Wine in Austin yielded this McKenna for $9.99. Many positive reviews spurred me to buy. Poured neat, nose has some dusty spice, mild vanilla custard and leather. Palate is more spice, light sweetness and a lot of heated oak. There is some serious barrel flavor here. Finishes with strong drying oak, fading spice and watery caramel. Overall I find it a bit thin but the bottle grew on me as I went through it For $10 its decent bourbon but the problem is TW has Evan Williams BIB for $12 which is the mac daddy low cost whiskey................77/100"
