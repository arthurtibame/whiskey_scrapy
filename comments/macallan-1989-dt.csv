4.0,"I have the idea that this whisky has spent its time in a combination of ex Sherry and Bourbon casks: cherry infused in spirit, nutmeg, beeswax, salted butter, wood in the background. Very sober and elegant. Over time, it sweetens by bringing out ripe fruit and a pinch of vanilla.
At the entrance you can feel the presence of wood, not unpleasant but a little intrusive, accompanied by spicy hints, orange peel, pineapple, unripe kiwis, gianduja cream. A sweet palate mottled with amarotic notes.
The finish is medium, with sugared almonds, spices, bitter orange and wood.
Not very balanced, I would say almost a ruffled Macallan, in which the barrels perhaps got a little out of hand.  Particular and unusual, but not unforgettable."
