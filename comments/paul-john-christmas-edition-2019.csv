4.5,"Yeah, this is good. The Aroma is rich and fruity with dark sweet malty notes and a touch of spice; Palate carries a heavy dank sweetness with subtle earthy notes, smoke and spice; Finish pulls through all the sweet notes with barely a hint of the smoke or earthy tones."
5.0,"Among the first people in the us to try this from a drammers club tasting with @Richard-ModernDrinking and had this immediately after the 2018. This one edges out the 2018 with notes of Chocolate, Dates, Sultanas, Vanilla, Prunes, Espresso, Peat, Figs, Guava, Citrus, Pineapple, Toffee, and Banana. This was aged 5 years in bourbon casks and a further 2 years finished in PX casks. Interestingly, unlike the sherry seasoned casks common in the whisky industry, Paul John uses the casks that were actually used to age sherry for 10-15 years"
