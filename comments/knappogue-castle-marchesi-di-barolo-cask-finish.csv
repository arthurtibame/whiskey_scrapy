5.0,"Entry 3/3 of Knappogue Castle's Cask Finish Series. The first two were absolutely fantastic, so I've got high hopes for this one. Let's get into it.

Nose: Mixture of green and red apple (more green) and pear. White and red grape. Banana, coconut, pineapple, and some raisin. Shortbread cookie, toffee, vanilla, malt, and custard. Very floral with powerful oak. Super clean, no hint of ABV. Just clean and delicious fruity, floral, and sweet notes.

Palate: Plenty more of the apple notes (both colors). There's also plum, apricot, and pear. Raisin and cranberry. Banana and orange citrus. White and red grape. More shortbread, malt, and toffee, and vanilla, now with some caramel. Once again, powerful oak. Reflects a lot of what I liked about the nose, but trades some floral notes for citrus. Superb.

Finish: Moderate-long. Oak hits heavy here. Some spice from the ABV finally presents itself. Cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. Red fruit notes carry over, tucked away in the background. Red apple, cranberry, plum, and raisin. It's drier but still a bit sweet.

Fantastic series. All 5/5 in my book. These three whiskies are the pinnacle of the Irish whiskey category. Take this one for example. Solid base distillate (rumored to be sourced from Bushmills or Cooley?) Carefully aged in some of the finest casks. I'm not a big wine guy, but I'd love to try Marchesi di Barolo just to get a better understanding of the cask influence exerted here.

Genius idea by KC. The Jefferson's of Irish whiskey, except the execution is significantly better. My favorite Irish whiskey brand. Would love to see what they can do with their own distillate. Either way, absolute winner right here. 1200 bottles produced. Buy on sight."

4.5,"Lots to mull over as the Knappogue Castle Marchesi di Barolo Cask opens and rolls out. Each sip and sniff I find something new to enjoy and it had me scrambling to find a bottle locally. It’s going to be tough for anything to ever compete with that Knappogue Castle 1951, when it comes to being unique and interesting, but this makes a valiant delicious effort."
4.25,Maybe the best Irish I’ve had.
