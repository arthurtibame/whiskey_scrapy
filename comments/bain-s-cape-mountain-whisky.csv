3.0,"Won the Wold's Best Grain Whisky award by Whisky Magazine in 2013. Interesting take on a South African bourbon. Since winning the award the price has doubled locally to $18 which is about the same as a bottle of Jack Daniels. Just like Jacks, it needs to be served on ice."

3.0,Bourbon :p
3.0,"Not a bad blended whisky, and as a single grain aged in bourbon, it's fascinating to experience what a ""bourbon"" outside of its American context tastes like. There are notes of vanilla, cinnamon (?) and bananas. The finish is short and light."

3.0,"Day 3 of my 2017 advent. Conventional smell, in a pleasant way. Thin, spicy flavor. Very unique and warming to the core. It’s an exotic flavor. If I ever try it again, it will be over plenty of ice (to tame the burn, and hopefully enhance the unique flavor). Would try it again, but at this point wouldn’t buy a whole bottle."

3.0,"Simple, but decent whisky. First one with such an oily profile I’ve encountered. Very sweet bourbon with bold vanilla and banana on the palate. Also my first South African dram, so might be worth to pick up again on the next trip down there."

4.0,"3 stars neat. An extra star for the price and the fact that for some reason, mixed with lemonade over ice this becomes probably the most refreshing cocktail I've ever had.  It's unique. Closest comparisons would be a less dusty, more flavorful Mellow Corn or a less 'hot', less complex Nikka Coffey Grain."

2.5,Toffee and sweet. Nice as a desert whisky but not for those that like a spicier or peaty tipple.
3.5,"Different. 
Sweet on the nose
Palate of butterscotch and grain"
2.0,"Nose: Lemon peel, grass, caramel, and vanilla.

Palate: incredibly sweet. Butterscotch, vanilla, creme brûlée, and cinnamon.

Finish: Medium, mostly citrus fruits with some wood and baking spice.

Overall: BELOW AVERAGE. While it is reasonably priced, the only real appeal to this whiskey is that it’s South African, and therefore different. It’s a single grain whiskey that essentially only incorporates corn in the mashbill. Because of this, it’s flavor profile is very similar to a bourbon, but there are far better bourbons available for the price. There are also single grain whiskies that are much better than this. Finally, there are better examples of whiskey from countries outside Scotland or America. If you’re curious about this, give it a try, but I highly doubt you’ll buy a second bottle."
4.25,"Nov 2019.
Clear medium deep gold.
Powerful oaky vanilla, toasted sweet new wood, tree bark, new American oak, toffee, Christmas cake, and cinnamon, star anise and lots of sweet spicy in the banquet.
Dry, medium full body with vanilla, honey, tree bark, sweet banana syrup, plastic, dried spicy and some coke in the palate.
Good young Woody single grain, medium new lightly toasted oak finish."

4.5,"Nov 2019.
Clear gold.
Small tulip.
Powerful sweet vanilla, banana, maple syrup, sweet butterscotch, sweeten kernel fruit, sweet caramel vanilla brûlée and vanilla pudding in nose.
Medium full body with wood spicy, dried sweet spicy, butterscotch, maple syrup, overripe pear and overripe melon in palate.
Awesome sweet balance with wood spicy, like a intense and heavy straight punch on face. Sweet smooth finish.
Lot’s of oak in both nose and taste but not like bourbon whiskey which contains plastic, paraffin or even petroleum nose. And definitely more intense than the Suntory Chita single grain due to the double 1st fill bourbon cask maturation."
