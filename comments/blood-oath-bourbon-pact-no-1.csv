3.0,"Given the $70 price of expect more from the bottle than it's given in my 4 different tastings so far. As it sits out, the flavor complexity does seem to grow and become more nuanced. Nonetheless, this whiskey is not worth two bottles of Eagle Rare, Evan Williams Single Barrel, or even basic Willet. If you want somewhat snootier blended whiskey with some age then go with the lower cost High West campfire or something similar."

3.0,"I usually enjoy my whiskey neat. However, given all the hype this one left much to be desired. After drinking through about an ounce and a half I added a few drops of water to the remaining and found the oaky vanilla and spicy bourbon I was expecting on the first sip. For me, this whiskey is just not worth it."

5.0,"This is amazingly complex.  My wife bought me a bottle as a gift, I did not know what to expect.
Nose is plums, cherries, BBQ sauce, and cinnamon.
Taste is vanilla, brown sugar, cherries, spice, wood, and almond.
Finish is smooth but lasting sweet and cherry.
This is the best bourbon I ever had.  When I said we got to get more of this - she told me what it cost - it is worth every dam penny!"

3.0,"Smooth neat. As the official review suggests, it is a no-frills bourbon. The nose really gives away the wheater among the three. A small amount of water really opened it up. Solid, but not spectacular."

4.0,Carmel Apple and sugar are noticeable. 2nd of the 4 I’ve had. Liked 2 more but for the first in the line it is profoundly smooth and rich.
