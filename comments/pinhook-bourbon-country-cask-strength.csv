4.0,"Spicy and flavorful high proof goodness. Spicy rye blends into a nutty mid palette. The nose is very appealing and the juice backs up the promise. Very pleased to see a barrel proof expression from this NDP. Hope to see more from them, especially juice that originates from Castle and Key."

3.25,"Nose - heavy corn, slight hint of banana pudding, bits of vanilla and oak
Palate - dominated by corn then an almost nutty taste on the toungue
Finish - slight hint of caramel and dark chocolate. More age would do this bourbon wonders. Better overall with some drops of water."

1.5,"MGP juice...batch proof...I've heard good things, what the heck?  

Nose - Smooth creams and vanillas over young cheap cheap oak notes.  A touch of earth, perhaps some hay or straw.  

Taste - Butter, oat bran, young oak, vanilla...a bit different but no sharp notes, alcohol is well under control, good mouth feel.  

50 bucks.  At that price I can't recommend.  This is just too young.  This is too expensive.  It's also not the sweet and oaky mix I like for mixing.  

This is for the adventurous with money to spend.  I'm a bit disappointed given some hype I heard and the price point.  That said it's pretty good if you're just comparing it to 3 year old bourbons.  Actually very good for that standard."

2.25,"Young. Heavy corn and ethanol on the palate, no oak at all. You get some rye spice, but overall just corn. No a fan, but it may do well in a Boulevardier or Manhattan..."
3.75,"So before I dive into this review let's discuss the specifics of this release:
1) It's age stated at 3 yrs old
2) It's distilled at MGP
3) It's a 75 barrel blend 
4) Mashbill: 70% Corn, 20.5% Rye, 4.5% Malted Barley
5) Blended by Castle and Key Distillery in Frankfort, KY
This is Pinhook's first cask strength release. I have had both the Rye and Bourbon standard releases and quite enjoyed them for the money. So based on that experience and this being $50, I thought why the heck not. Let's see if it is worth the money:
Upon entry there is a burst of candied fruits (think like gummy bears and Skittles) and a floral bouquet. It's also very smooth for the 115 proof and fairly viscous. Mid palatte introduces barrel spices and some oak. The finish is medium with with more spice, oak, dried fruits and a trailing vanilla note. 
Overall it's a really tasty and fairly simple pour. However, it does have enough going on to keep you engaged. The most impressive part of this Bourbon is just how well the blend has been able to mask it's youth. No sweet corn, bitter oak or banana notes to be found. The only thing that gives away it's age is the lack of a robust finish. 
All in all for $50 it's a worthwhile purchase. It's a great entry into the world of cask strength Bourbon. Distribution seems to be East coast heavy so if you are on that coast seek this out (I've seen it as low as $40). 
Cheers all and Happy Thursday!"
2.0,"I really like the philosophy and plan that Pinhook is working with.  I will continue to try their products, but they certainly display obvious traits of a young whiskey.  With time, they'll shine, but at this point the barrel aged bourbon is going to need more time to round out the pallet and mouthfeel."

4.75,Not sure what the rye percentage on this is but it tastes like it’s pretty high. Still a stellar bourbon and honestly muchhhh better than bourbon country. Burn at the end but incredible flavor. $50

3.5,"Light caramel at the beginning, middle of the palate is light fruit (I get strawberries) and cask strength heat kicks in; but not overwhelming and not like rye spice, then it finishes off (rather quickly)to light oak."
