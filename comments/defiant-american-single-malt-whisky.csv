1.0,A nose of sour barley with a hint of oak. The taste starts with a sweet caramel on the tip of the tongue that quickly bursts on the back and sides of the tongue with a sour barley flavor and a heavy saltiness. That flavor burst is what remains on the tongue when all is said and done.

3.0,"Light nose with a little nutty and honey. Warm and a bit spicy on the palate, with more walnut and vanilla. Very short finish"

4.0,Very enjoyable neat or with a small bit of water. A nice bread-yeast nose. The oak is understated letting the barley come through. A very nice and honest departure from your typical bourbon.

4.0,"This was the first whiskey I enjoyed sipping neat. Love that this is a local North Carolina product. Instead of inventing some cockamamie backstory and sourcing some whiskey from a mega distiller, they worked to produce an honest, quality product. Malty sweetness with oak and hints of tobacco and leather on the nose. Enters the palate with a mild sweetness that hangs around in the background through the finish. Mid-palate is my favorite part of Defiant. A wonderful Old leather and smoke combination. Limited burn on the finish. On the rocks, the sweetness takes center stage relegating the smoke and leather to a supporting role. This product has perfected the ""chipping"" or ""insertion"" method for quick aging."

3.0,"Fresh honeycomb, coconut and vanilla on the nose. The palate isn't as sharp as reviewed, but layers a good amount of spice, caramel, toasty nuttiness, leather and sweet vanilla. The finish is the calling card of this pour with good legs and a rollercoaster of sweet baking spices."

4.5,"Read the story of how this is made.  Very unique, a combo of this and aging in Barrell might be a sweet spot?   I hate scotch but I love this one even though it has a hint of scotch to it.  Otherwise buttery sweet with caramel and vanilla.  A smooth drinker, love it.  Some of the reviews I see don’t make any sense.  Just because it isn’t aged like other bourbons, it’s new, unique and delicious.  And yes I’m a NC native so prob a bit biased."
1.0,"As a North Carolinian, I sincerely wish Defiant the best. But as a scotch and bourbon drinker, I’m just not a fan (as much as I wanted to be). The act of aging a whiskey is fundamental to its excellence, and I’m afraid their shortcut process just doesn’t produce the kind of whiskey I’m looking for."

2.25,"Tasted at room temperature / Norlan glass / no water or ice added.   82 proof.   

The nose is honey, vanilla, and orange peel, and far exceeded my expectations.  There's a bit of alcohol in the nose as well, but I suspect that has dissipated since I first got this bottle as it has been open for some time prior to this tasting.
  
On the palate its an entirely different whiskey, coming across as hot, young, and rough-edged.  If you let it move around your mouth fully, you will get some maltiness to offset the alcohol you're first confronted with.  Kind of hard to isolate flavor profiles here.  Aside from malt, maybe a little citrus?

The finish is respectable mid-tongue, but non-existent throughout the rest of the palate.  What does linger is an enjoyable orange-vanilla."
4.0,Butterscotch and oak.
4.0,Lots of vanilla on the nose with some underlying flowery scent. Spicy/black pepper taste after the initial sip with some light peat that fades into a flowery taste (like a rose). Quite a pleasant experience.

2.0,"This was given to me as a gift. I’m not really a malt whiskey or Scotch drinker, I’m very much a Bourbon drinker, so keep that in mind. I will say the aging process, or lack there of, has made me a little apprehensive. But this was a gift, so here it goes.

The nose has honey, fresh malt, slight bandaid note and a very strong notes of tequila. Not something that I enjoyed nosing.

The palate is sweet with notes of honey, tequila and vanilla.

The finish is short with a little lingering vanilla and a slight bitter aftertaste.

Like I stated before, I don’t frequent this category of whiskey, but it didn’t even remind me much of scotch or other malt whiskies. It just tasted young and one dimensional and for some reason that dimension was tequila?
I know this company is “defiant” in their approach to making whiskey, but it didn’t work for me. It reminds me of how a child defies their parents, but in this case their dad is Father Time and he can’t be fooled."
1.5,If you like bourbon. Don’t drink this.

2.75,"Was told it was reminiscent of Scotch. While the recipe echos that claim, the taste lacks the smokiness and depth of a good Scotch. A bit sweeter than expected as well. It’s unique, I think, but not great."
