3.0,This age of the Highland Park is my least favorite. I have had it like it is here as well as the 15 year old Loki version. I find it to be very offensive to both the nose and the palate. The nose is smoky and sharp while the taste is peaty and can I say bourbony? I know not a word but cheap bourbony that bites at your tongue while lashing with fumes at your nose. Definitely not my favorite HP but I maybe harsh because IT IS an HP and I expect something else.

4.0,Tasted 10/15/2014 : Light sweet nose.  Smooth and creamy and well rounded. Sweet vanilla palate.  Long sweet balanced finish.  Very good dram. Lacks the smoke/peat like the 12 year old.

4.0,"Cool autumn breeze rolls over the countryside hills painted in green and blue. Scent of bluebells welcomes me with their sweet smiles. Over the naked trees at a distance, a stream of old lazy smoke sways across seemingly endless blue sky and invites me in for a supper. A rustic, humble plate prepared by rough but gentle hands, followed by caramel glazed apple pie. As the night deepens, I sit by the fire and enjoy his food and company in peace and quiet."
4.0,"Smells just peaty enough to let me know that all is well. Wild honey is the first thing I taste, which is also how I'd describe the color in this pub lighting. Lightly smoky, very nutty, and richly woody. Being the oldest single malt I've tried, the bourbon influence is coming through really strongly. Very much enjoyed it. A nice dram!"
3.0,"This HP 15 Scotch suffers the fate of so many 15 year olds. It is past the sweet subtleness of flavored of its 12 yr brother and no where near he depth of flavor of its 18 year old sibling. It is truly a middle child of this otherwise wonderful range. This is not to say it is not worthy of a tasting or even a purchase, just keep in mind the trade offs and don't set you expectations to high."

4.0,"My first experience with this northernmost distillery:
For the nose neat, peat was slight to moderate with banana and oak notes. The first taste was smooth and warm with a mild peat and sherry flavor, and some char, followed by a long burn finish. Added a few drops of water to open things up which added butter to the nose, and a sweeter, less peat flavor, as well as a nice oily mouth feel. The finish was a long peppery burn that went all the way down into my chest. All in all, it would have been pleasant Orkney afternoon if only I had been there."

4.0,"If they bottled this at 46% ABV with a little more kick of flavor, this probably would be a 5-star scotch in my book.  Even as it stands, I prefer this one to the 18-year (blasphemy, I know!), especially since the 18-year is often double the price of this one.  The level of complexity and enticing flavors here is impressive.  The nose greets you with the distinct flavors of fortified wine, but more like a port or even a moscato than a sherry (the type of cask in which it's actually aged).  A few sips later, though, I get the light vanilla cream note that I also find in the 18-year expression--what I think of as settling in to the Highland Park experience.  The palate is sweet and a bit tart, again with a lot of the characteristics of a fortified wine.  The palate is where a little extra oomph would come in handy, as it is a little thin in texture.  The finish is the strongest feature, and it's where that hint of peat comes out to play.  I have a hard time believing this is as lightly peated as Distiller claims, because I definitely get a nice toasty finish of barrel char, peat, cocoa nibs, and coffee.  It's a wonderful finish, particularly because it's a little unexpected.  The best kind of surprise.  It is a very different finish than the 18-year, less drying and with more smoke.  Although it lacks a bit of the complexity of its older brother, I might prefer this one without taking price into account.  And with price factored in, it's no contest--15 all the way!"

Taste - A bit thin on the palate, thin fruity floral honey, dried cherries and strawberries, black pepper spice, wisp of dry fruit wood smoke, hint of black tea bittersweet and wet tobacco, tellicherry peppercorns, light brine.
Finish - Lingering lightly medicinal fruity sweet, goji berries, sweet spicy tellicherry peppercorn spice, gentle smoke from the morning after a campfire that used fruit (cherry/apple) wood.
Score - 91/100
Final Thoughts - This is a very well balanced lightly peated Scotch. It hits on all the right notes that I like with a complex balance of sweet and gentle smoke that keeps your tastebuds and nose wanting another go at it. It's definitely not an ""everyday dram"" as you sort of have to be in the mood for it; or at least I am with any peated Scotch. I think this would be best neat or with a tiny bit of water, ice might kill the subtle smoke and brine a bit, but I have yet to experiment with that."

4.0,"It’s amazing what three years can do to a whisky.  The 18 is light years away from the 12, but the 15 is also substantially better as well. The nose has a little peat, sweet caramel, nice floral notes, pineapple...very nice. At first, I went in neat at 43%, but a few drops of water helped out. On the palate, there are golden raisins, light brown sugar, cinnamon, and some nice peat in there as well.  An intense sweet and sour (balanced) finish follows with a hint of smoke.  Wow!  Since Highland Park is discontinuing this soon, what is supposed to take its place? If it’s the Valkyrie, that is not good because the quality is not matched."

4.0,"Day 20. For once we got some classic scotch. Not the revered 18, but the 15. It's interesting what a few years more can to to whisky. It does have a classic HP baseline, but there are also some notes in there that don't remind me of HP at all. Let's start with the nose. There is a dominant note of smoky seaair with a nice dose of salt, some light honey and present notes of pear. Fairly standard in a good way so far, the taste is what threw me off at first. Spicy smoke, then an overwhelming salty barley note, some honey, the pears are now mixed with some apples and covered with spices and brine. Somewhat aggressive, salty, sour, not too hot, and leaves an amazing barley smoke aftertaste. I like this stuff. Looking forward to try the 18. Curious what 3 more years could do."

Well a year later I have found another bottle, well actually several bottles hiding in a small shop that will remain nameless. This is an amazing whisky. If you can still find a bottle buy as many as you can. It has more peat and way more sherry than the 12 year old. On the front end you get very rich sherry then on the finish you get a nice tobacco smoke. It is a shame Highland Park does not make it anymore. I think this is the best they have ever made. If I lived on the island of Orkney I would protest outside the distillery until they brought it back."

4.0,"33 open bottles in my collection ranked through multiple blind tastings.  Counting them down!

#17: Highland Park .  Single Malt Scotch.  43% ABV.  15 year old.
Paid $90
I am convinced Highland Park had the most polished core range of age statement whiskies until they lost their wannabe Viking minds.  As such, even though the 15 year old is so-so for VFM, I will buy another bottle just to collect the discontinued bottles.  I can still easily find the 15 where I am at.

This is not just an older and more complex version of the 12 or a younger sibling of the 18.  While the 18 is the spiritual big brother of the 12; the 15 is the awkward middle child.  It is lighter and friendlier due to being aged in American oak sherry rather than European oak.  Red apples, red Twizzlers, powdered sugar and dough.  Vanilla wood and just a hint of heathery Orkney peat.  Although I did not have a direct comparison, this is probably as good as the old HP 12, which can still be had for about half the price, so it’s hard to justify purchasing too many HP 15s.  Plus, for $20-50 more, you can get the legendary HP 18, which is easily worth the extra spending.  Still, the HP 15 is a playful curiosity that is quite enjoyable.  As general advice, snatch up the old bottlings of HP.  Their new over-the-top tattoo-art bottles is like David Beckham – you ain’t tough, I don’t care how many tattoos you have.  I would understand if Laphroaig went Viking, but HP?

4.25,"Up until now, all of my encounters with Highland Park have been post-Viking re-branding. The latter is pretty cool, but also kind of goofy. Anyway, in this review I'll turn back the clocks and dive into an HP expression that was dropped altogether. Before it was discontinued, HP had bumped this one up from a 40% to a 43%. This is one sits at 43.

Nose: When I first cracked it, the peat was undetectable. However, upon comparing it to two unpeated sherry cask malts, the peat was clear as day. At this I'd call it a subtle peat aroma, emphasis on the subtle. The most prominent notes are lime and vanilla. Some honey. Beyond that, it's floral, grassy, leafy, and reminiscent of orchard fruits. This is one is rounded of by some sherry sweetness and a light oakiness. Very nice; just which it was a hair more potent.

Palate: Heavy vanilla, followed by plum, orange peel, and lime. It's a combination of sherry and citrus notes. These are complimented by light salt, smoke, and oak spice. A very mild cinnamon kick at the end. Surprisingly oily and leathery. Delicious.

Finish: Short to moderate. Cinnamon and oak spice before fading into sherry sweetness.

All in all, I'm glad to have found one of these. The last in the store, and the first I'd ever seen on the shelf.

4 for this one. It's incredibly enjoyable and is great as a sipper or as a background whisky. A lot to love here. This one just hits all the right notes.

Say what you will about the marketing, I'm here for the whisky. Call it the 'HP 15 Viking Soul' and dress it up in over-the-top Nordic packaging; if this one makes a return, I'll be first in line."

Highland Park
OB
15 years old
43% ABV
Bottled 2014
Price: 90 USD

The shy middle child of Highland Park’s once respected core range, this whisky is for those who appreciate soft, subtle single malts.  It’s very floral and sweet initially, but there’s a rugged maritime edge as well.  Lightly spicy and lightly smoky, you will find the 15 year less bold than the precocious 12 year old; and less robust than the lovely 18 year old.  A failure to stand out is probably why this was the first of the three to be discontinued.  This is a fine dram, but a passive one at that.  It is more refined than the 12 year old, but not necessarily better.  And at almost twice the price, that’s a problem.  I will make sure I have at least one of the recently discontinued bottlings of the 12 and 18 year olds stashed away, but I will pass on re-purchasing this 15.

Bottled at 43%abv, with a deep copper color, spectacular thick legs on the glencairn.

On the nose is wonderful, Cream, Peat, Bread, Cake, Sherry; citrus notes like Prune peel, Orange peel and Lemon peel. Perfumed caramel, mostly Sweet aroma, Super elegant, Marzipan; Made me think as a dalmore with peat, Complex and great. After a while i also got fine Chocolate.

On the palate, tobbacco is the main note as any other highland park. Oranges, balanced spicyness, mostly clove. Amazingly balanced, overall taste is dry with some bitterness but pleasant. Finish is medium-long, with bonfire peat and clove.

My score for this baby is 95 over 100. Very very recommended, this is my new highland park choice."

4.5,"I received this bottle for free over 5 years ago, and saved it for a special occasion because I knew this was being discontinued. After defending my dissertation I opened both this and a Macallan 17Y in celebration. There was no comparison between the two, this is the far superior Scotch, and one of the best Scotch whiskeys I've had. Before this year I've never had peated Scotch before, then I jumped right in the deep end with Ardbeg 10. I love that Scotch, but I really think the milder peated Scotch hits every note just right. This and Talisker 10Y being the best examples I've tried.

Disclaimer - my bottle is 43% abv, but I could only find 40% abv listed on Distiller. The nose is a beautiful sherried peat, not overwhelming at all like a heavily peated Scotch. It is somewhat sweet, with a little citrus zest, maybe orange? It is drier on the taste, the oak and sherry stand out while the peat is more muted than I expected from nosing. I also get a little brine, but not nearly as much as other coastal or island Scotch. The wood lingers on the finish, as it is surprisingly oily and lasts long. Although it was aged in toasted barrels, not charred, I can't quite tell where that makes a difference. I would not say this is an overtly complex Scotch, but the flavors mesh together so well that it's highly drinkable. It's a shame you cannot find it regularly if at all these days, but it's possible one of their current releases is similar to this."

3.5,"Ah the bastardized legacy which is Highland Park. Long before the NAS debacle which is still winding it's way to a sorry end or not, who really knows or cares, it had a solid core range. Now weirdly I had built it up in my mind as this legend of a distillery corrupted to it's core by aimless NAS releases however although there were plenty of those my top two out of the dozen HPs i've had have been Fire and Ice so go figure. I have Light and Dark to come and they are meant to be great so really my ravings about a legacy corrupted dont really hold true...although all those 4 are absolutely stupid pricing even though a couple are teenages so there is a grain of truth there.

However that aside after those drams the standard 12 and 15 years seem a bit safe and boring to be honest, no fire in them excuse the pun. Apparently the age statement legacy was in turn a marketing effort as this was released for the TRE mkt which leads me to wonder what preceded this age stmt range? 

Anyhow this is a simple sweet lightly smoked pleasant well balanced dramdram nothing more or less. Solid 3.5"
