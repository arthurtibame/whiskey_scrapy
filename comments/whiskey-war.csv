3.25,Peppery start
2.5,A sourced whiskey. Not a problem but it's only aged 2 years. High rye to make up for how young it is. Distillary is a nice place with good food and cocktails. enterested to see what this place does once they age thier own juice.

3.0,A rye-heavy mash bill that has a hint of pepper spice on the front and an overall smooth and sweet experience for the palate. Aged no less than 2 years.
