3.75,"I was hoping for more, but didn’t get it.  This has a nice brown sugar, banana and oak smell on the nose.  The flavor profile has a sweet and pronounced wood, more brown sugar, toasted almond, caramel and butter to it.  At 93 proof, I thought this would be subtle in alcohol-I was wrong.  This is nice, not overly complex. Decent for the price."
3.25,"Nose... Vanilla, green apples, butterscotch, and an herbal touch.

Color... A light to medium copper.

Taste... Seasoned wood, pepper, grass, cherry, slight ethanol, and dessert notes filter through...

Overall... Two nights in with this one and I'm just not sold. It's age statement led me to believe I'd find some real depth of flavors after nine years in the barrel. That just want the case. It's definitely good, and it has some complexity, just not what I was assuming I'd find..."

3.5,When you first open the bottle you get a vanilla cherry Coke smell. However after pouring it and sipping it neat you find that the non-chill filtered has a lasting flavor it’s not spicy or smoky the heat comes on after it lingers in your mouth. Not an overly complex bourbon but good to try if you want to go out on
