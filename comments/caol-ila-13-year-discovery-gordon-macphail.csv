3.75,"I'm a big fan of this unique scotch.  It blends a buttery, meaty initial flavor with a nice sweet, citrus finish and has a good amount of smoke throughout that lingers on the pallet."

3.25,"The nose and palate are mostly pears, citrus. Smoke actually appears only afterthe  alcohol burn at the very end of the finish. Which is a weird disconnect, as if I am drinking two different scotches. Not overly complex. I am not a big fan of caol Ila 12 or Johnnie Walker and this didn't change my mind."

4.0,"Nose: plesent peaty smoke that isn't too aggressive or potent. Charcoal undertones and ending in sweet apples. 

Palate: a light texture. Sweet fruity notes of apple and orange that underline the peaty warmth filling the mouth. Slightly medicinal iodine in the finish."
