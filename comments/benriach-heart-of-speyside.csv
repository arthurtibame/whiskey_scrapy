2.5,"An interesting bottle of some creative cask mixing attempts. I assume the whisky itself is very young but what sets this one aside from other BenRiachs is the explosion of dried fruits you get both from the nose and the palate. It is a bowl of raisins, dried apricots and dates. It sadly doesn’t have much else to offer after that. But it is something different while also being very light. I think this might be a good whisky to present to people new to the whisky world."

3.0,"Nose - Ripe pears, floral, thin honey

Taste - Light floral honey sweetness, gentle warmth, fresh overrripe pears, creamy mouthfeel, dried apples

Finish - Lingering gentle warmth, light fruity bitterness, light fruity sour

Score - 73/100

Final Thoughts - Not bad, but quite boring. I think the best thing this has going for it is the great mouthfeel for being only 40% abv. It's got a nice creamy/oily mouthfeel but other than that it's quite boring. One-dimensional and the finish has this weird subtle bitter/sour that's a bit distracting.

Would I drink it if offered? - Maybe

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"
