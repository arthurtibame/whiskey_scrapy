3.75,"I have had several bottles of this Bourbon and it has grown on me over the course of the last 2 years. I first had this at an Army base in Alabama and it was respectable but I mainly mixed it and drank it at parties. However, when I tried it on the rocks and then neat I realized that for the price it is a really decent to good Bourbon. It does have an opening smell of vanilla and then the feeling in my mouth is a bit warm and the woods come out. It is a good Bourbon it has a little more substance than Evan Williams 1783 but it is also more expensive. I think this is one of the bottles that are in the ""wide appeal"" it does not have very many highs or lows or this is a very good introductory Bourbon. That is not a bad thing I could buy this at any time and enjoy it, but it is also not what I would pick to sit with friends and talk about things. I do like it and I will continue to drink it and have it in my bar but it is a role player and not a star."
