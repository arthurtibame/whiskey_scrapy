A fine dram even if a bit unexciting. Had this on a vacation in Scotland and brought a bottle home since I’d never heard of it."

3.0,"Is this a good drop? Is the national animal of Scotland a unicorn? The answers are hell no and amazingly yes. Ok it's not terrible but the only thing sadder than a mothballed distillery is a mothballed distillery came back to life for little purpose. I see the 21 year wasn't outstanding either. Think Chivas Regal of which this is a component and you sum up this one's character. Weak, flacid and not a lot going. Still like a blend it's not offensive, no burn or imbalance. 3...just."
