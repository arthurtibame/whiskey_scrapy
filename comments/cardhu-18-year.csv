3.0,"Thanks to a blind tasting flight challenge sent to me by @Generously_Paul I was able to sample this 18yo malt from Cardhu.

I don’t have the typical notes I like to take as I was more tuned in towards trying to identify the differences between 5 different whiskies and spirits.  What I did notice about this one was how harsh it was for being aged for quite a long time.  I remember some great sherry notes and not a lot of heat, but I’m inclined to think that the quality of the casks used here was a bit lacking.

That said, I’d give this a middle of the road score of 3 stars and I’d be happy to revisit it later on and put it through its proper paces if I can land another pour somewhere down the road.  Thanks again, Paul.  The challenge was a blast.  Cheers."

3.0,"Apples and dried fruit (raisins) on the nose makes for a pleasant bouquet. Honey, vanilla and chocolaty malt on the palate is tasty, but a little muted. The finish is sweet and of a medium length. It's good, but lacks complexity for me."
4.0,"A delicious whisky with floral and honey notes. The palate has added notes of peppercorn and hazelnut, while the finish is smooth and medium in length. There isn't necessarily any depth or complexity here, and in many ways it just plays it safe, but it's still delicious."

4.0,"The nose is full of ripe caramel which continues to the palate with a little syrup and chocolate. Super smooth. Had very different experiences with this in a wide vs narrow (glencairn) glass as I picked up a lot more on the wider nosing glass. Felt more one dimensional in the glencairn. Maybe I've had too many today :)

Take 2 - nose full of ripe oranges and pineapple"

3.75,"Nose: 4* Candy red apples, plums, honey.

Palate: 3,5* Smooth, little coating, dark chocolate, hazelnuts, slightly fruity.

Finish: 3,75* Medium long, light pepper, intense oak, walnuts, pure chocolate, dry honey lingers.

Best neat. Very accessible and quite smooth, not as complex as most other whiskies of this age, but the price justifies this."
3.25,"Herbal and grassy notes, creamy smell afterwards. Sharp and herbal taste with soft and well-rounded character, but fades away quickly."
2.75,"The first impression wasn’t really good to be honest. It smelled like dust and kinda aggressive especially for a 18y old and for 40% ABV. 

But give it a short while and a few sips and then it becomes nicer - much nicer. 

In a blind tasting I would never have guessed that this one is Speyside. Definitely more Highlands or Islands. It also has a surprising face-punch of alcohol although it only has 40% ABV. 

But the flavors here are interesting if you give it some time. You get earth, fermented apple, dry hay, chocolate and a lot of malt attached to wood. 

It tastes a little sweet at first but then an oaky drift takes it place plus some dried chili burn. It has a wood bitterness and then gets its malty sweetness back and paves your whole tongue with a dry mineraly sensation. 

The transformation from a “meh” first impression to something interesting and seriously mature made this one quite likable for me. I wouldn’t buy a whole bottle but also would gladly accept a dram if offered. 

The profile reminds me of Glen Scotia. For me definitely worth a try."

3.75,"I won this bottle at auction a few months back and decided it was time to open it. The Cardhu 18 is a UK exclusive that goes for around $75-80. My winning bid was about $60 after the exchange rate. Add on 10% fees plus shipping and I’d say that I paid close to UK retail. Let’s see what’s under the hood of this Speyside single malt. Bottled at 40% ABV, is chill filtered and has colorant added making it an amber honey color. 

The nose has lots of honey, some citrus and is malty. Tangerine marmalade, peaches, grapes and some light apples. Predominantly sherry notes, but there also seems to be some bourbon maturation as well. Brown sugar, caramel, buttered toast. Coffee or mocha, toffee, maple. Nutty - Brazil nuts, hazelnut, nutmeg, ginger and anise. Floral, grassy and perfumed, green oak at times. For a moment there was a super sweet/fruity note like Skittles or Fruity Pebbles. 

The palate starts with oranges and tangerines and honey. Very malty, but more of a dark roasted malt akin to that used in a stout beer. Vanilla cream, anise, butterscotch. Oak tannins, dark chocolate, salted caramels. Faint mint, sherry, but more of a dark and juicy sherry rather than a sweet and fruity sherry. Green grapes and a gentle touch of wood smoke. Some wood spice, but it’s overall a mild and very drinkable whisky. 

A medium bodied mouthfeel that is creamy and lightly oily, dry. 
The finish is medium length with dark chocolate malt, honey and is dry. 

Looking back at my notes on the 12 year old, which is about $35 less in the UK market (I paid $60 here in Michigan), they seem to stack up fairly evenly. Honey, citrus and chocolate malt seem to be the Cardhu house profile. This 18 isn’t bad, but why pay more for what equates to a slightly darker and deeper version of the 12?  Not a great scotch, but it’s got the complexity where it counts and is not overly expensive. For that I give it a 3.75. 
Cheers"

3.0,"This was sent as a blind tasting challenge by my motor city buddy @Generously_Paul.  He sent 5 samples.  I guessed 3 right, and named one precisely as Yamazaki Distiller ( the sandalwood aroma gave it away).  I’m not a huge fan of Cardhu, but maybe that’s just me, considering the entire county of Spain loves this as their favorite single malt.  I forget the notes at this point...was good, but not good enough to buy a bottle.  Good enough to have at a hotel bar.  Thanks Paul !"
