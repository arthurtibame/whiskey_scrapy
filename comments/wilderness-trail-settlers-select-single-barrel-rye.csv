4.5,"Great rye my friends. Perfect rye spice with berry on the nose. Three thumbs up, yum in my tum."
4.25,"A gem of a Rye, smooth as the dickens despite the barrel strength. Round and slightly tart on the palette with the spice coming in on the finish. Absolutely worth it."

4.25,Very nice
3.75,"Barrel # 15L3019C, 55.5% ABV, bottle 59 of 238, tasted over a few weeks, usually in a Bourbon Trail glass.

One of the more unique, if not the most unique Rye I’ve had.  On the nose the proof is well hidden in a sweet, almost forest like aroma with a hint of licorice and pine.  I’m not a big licorice fan, but this is not off-putting to me, it actually hits a few things I like about it.  Very viscous, nice glass coating.

On the palate the proof again is well hidden, the first touch reminds me of the sweet smell of a pine forest after a rain.  Again a slight hint of licorice, very pleasant.  Medium viscosity on the palate, the proof kicks in just enough to give a medium length finish.  The sweetness with a hint of spice lingers on.

My favorite local liquor store recommended this to me.  At first I was taken back, it’s a very unique taste.  After a few pours it really started to grow on me.  The initial surprise wasn’t negative, it was unexpected.  I’ve really come to enjoy it and very happy with the purchase."
4.5,A delicious rye.
4.25,Unique flavor.  Enjoyed the flavor and finish for a higher proof
4.0,"Store pick. Very soft for a rye, especially at this 112 proof. Citrus on the nose, and coats the edges of the palate. Nice sweet finish, with some heat on the backend."

4.0,"Brief tasting.  Full notes some other time after I buy a bottle.

116 proof.  Absolutely no ethanol on the nose but also relatively flat.  Perhaps due to the stubby little tasting glass... it may offer a bit more character from a Glencairn.

Sweet... almost syrupy.  Thick mouthfeel.  Extremely easy to drink, sweetness dominates.  No evidence of the proof.  Background evidence of a licorice note, but very approachable.  Will need to try again in a more relaxed setting but seems very promising.  Much more appealing than the single barrel bourbon."

4.25,Amazing spice! Really really good
4.0,Great mint forward rye.
4.0,This is one of my favorite ryes.  Bottles on the shelf as of 6/19/19 are 100% pot-still whiskey.  Wilderness Trail has since switched to column still.  This rye has a barrel entry proof of 100... and my single barrel was bottled at 114 proof.  Wilderness Trail is a fine whiskey from a Kentucky craft distillery.
3.75,"Neat.  Really bright, floral nose.  Vanilla and spice behind that.  Proof can sneak up on you if you are not careful!

Full bodied texture, sits thick and heavy on the tongue.  Brown sugar and chocolate up front.  Gives way to a ton of spice.  It’s very savory on the taste relative to the bright nose.  There is an earthiness on the legs.  Kentucky hugs all over!  Vanilla comes through after a few sips.

It is very solid.  It isn’t a rye I will crave, but a solid rye to spend a night with."

4.25,"120 proof version.

Ok let’s start with nosing this you never in a million years guess its 120 proof both from the lack of ethanol and the overall delicacy of the aroma. Wildflower, honeysuckle, spearmint, berries, fresh cut Bermuda grass, ground mustard seed, and anise.

On the palate opens with lots of honey and sugar cookie, followed by strawberry, rye, and savory sweet corn in the mid palate. Finish is mint, black licorice, hay, and finely ground white pepper, and it’s ridiculously (and enjoyably) long. Flavors are rich and punchy, and the ride from sweet to savory to herbal flows seamlessly which always is going to score an extra point from me. Mouthfeel is very silky for a rye; another plus.

An assertive yet balanced rye. I really loved this. At $63, it’s inline for what you would expect to pay for a barrel proof rye and you get your money’s worth. Would buy again."
4.5,"After my first sip I had to take another look at the bottle to verify I had indeed read ""Barrell proof"". This is very surprisingly smooth for 115 proof rye - it does have a little bite, but not nearly as much as I'd expect. Overall a really delicious rye. One of my favorites."
