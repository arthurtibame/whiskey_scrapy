4.0,"My whisky resolution for 2019 is to get back to basics. Digressions this year into single cask bottlings have disappointed more often than they’ve enlightened. The first-fill sherry casks in particular, with one notable Springbank exception, have only served to underscore the magic of refill wood. And the abundance of high octane samples coming through my door have mostly reminded me that I like my whisky best at 46-50%. There’s no better rejoinder to the cult of the single cask than a good blend, and few better blenders than Compass Box, even if the increase in prices and releases this year has tested the loyalty of its fans. No sooner has the novelty of the Great King St Artist’s Blend marrying casks worn off than along comes this sherried cask finish of the Glasgow version, itself a sherry cask variation on the original blend. That makes this a derivative of a derivative, for those keeping score at home. A little more than 300 bottles were filled for the Houston Bourbon Society and Houston Wine Merchant at an ABV of 49%, of which a sample found its way to Modern Drinking HQ.

The nose is peanut skins, buttered toast and a hint of shoe polish, a balanced combination of sherry and malty notes. It’s lusciously syrupy in the mouth, with a creamy and lightly sweet flavor akin to toasted pecans. The finish is very long and smooth, with a pleasant hint of freshly planed pine wood. This is a delicious blend that’s significantly better than the original Glasgow bottling and also the marrying cask versions of the Artist’s Blend. It’s an easy, undemanding dram that feels like a vacation after the hard work of analyzing single casks. While my inner whisky geek will no doubt struggle next year to resist opportunities for tasting exotic casks from obscure distilleries, here’s hoping my better angels steer me more towards the less demanding choices. Except for that single cask Springbank I hinted at above. Of course I’m getting that. A man’s principles can only go so far."
