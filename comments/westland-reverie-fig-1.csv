4.0,Inviting nose and very balanced palate. Ripe stone fruit.
3.0,"A bit meh. This has earthy notes that remind me of soy. The taste is very straight forward and has quite a few elements in it, but many of them are lost in the peat and are difficult to pick out. Matches the qualities of a smokey dessert wine."
