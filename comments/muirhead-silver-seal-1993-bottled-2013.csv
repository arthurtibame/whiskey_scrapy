4.25,"An accidental bottle - not much info available 

Nose: figs, sweet raisins, buttered bread, red grapes, and medium bodied honey or stronger clover honey 

Development is slow - distant prune coming into woodspice and a mix of black pepper and white pepper.

With air on the finish a burst of caramel and barley type sugar shines through followed by the hum of wood spice, more sweet but oxidizing wine, and a dose of equine sweet feed.

Really a very good dram! A dram no one is searching for, but a very high value pick in my experience."
