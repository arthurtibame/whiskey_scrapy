2.0,"Sickening fake apple and bitter smoke on top of a mediocre corn based whiskey. 
Like apple and smoke flavored Seagrams VO."

1.0,Horrible nose. Can’t even put words to it. This is just bad through the drink. An odd combination of vanilla and smoke. No go.

1.0,Not my thing.   Smokey without being off putting.  Strange after taste I cannot quite put my finger on.  I would pass on a bottle.  Glad someone shared with me.
1.0,"Smells like sweet marshmallow 

Tastes like nothing, very little taste, bitter with a marshmallow ending. 

Where is the smoke??"

1.0,"A gift from my brother. 

Very weak, almost diluted forward flavor. I only picked up on bitter apples on the finish, which oddly arrived before I had even swallowed my sip. I tried my best to get through the whole bottle, I really did, but eventually it went into a reduction for an extraordinarily tasty sausage and peppers dish that my wife prepared. That's where the 1.0 rating came from.

Tasted neat.

My brother? We're no longer on speaking terms."
