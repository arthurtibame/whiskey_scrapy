3.75,I really liked this but I love smoke on my scotch and bourbon.   It was a little pricey but still really enjoyable.
2.0,"Another American craft I can cross off my list, this pour courtesy from @jonwilkinson7309.  The Berkshires are an extension of Vermont’s Green Mountains, sort of foothills of the Appalachians which extend all the way from North Carolina up to Maine and Canada.  It’s an idyllic area, in western Massachusetts, that’s known for summer cultural activities and food scene.  And like the mountain range, I’m guessing this distillery considered this release as an extension of Islay’s peat and smoke.  There’s certainly peat and smoke on the nose and palette, but it’s subdued...doesn’t hit you like Lagavulin , Ardbeg and Laphroaig.  It’s much more muted.  And the peat isn’t like Islay peat...but more like a Highlander trying to peat its whisky.  It’s interesting, and I can see this being really good in cocktails, but neat or just with a few drops of water, it’s too muted.   

Thanks Jon for the pour—-I love trying crafts!"
