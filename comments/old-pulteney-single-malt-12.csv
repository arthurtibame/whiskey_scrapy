4.0,"A nice , fairly affordable scotch that sits fairly between sweet and spicy ends of the spectrum. Doesn’t have the sweet film of flavor that Sherry aging brings and instead has a salty, briny crust to to the finish. Midpalette is a bit malty and woody, but overall is a very smooth dram. Purchased at $45, it’s definitely on my rotation for casual scotching."

3.0,"Paid $40 for this 2016 bottle. This is a bottle kill review. I will try to summarize what this bottle offered. 

Nose: Salty honeycomb.  Toffee.  Lemon.  Picture a stormy black night with waves crashing and all when you nose Talisker; this is the cleansing clear sunrise the morning after. 
Palate: Flat malty arrival that becomes more interesting as the salt and pepper start to emerge into the aftertaste.  Light crisp fruits. 
Finish: Refreshing.  Seawater with a lager and a lemon wedge.

Pros: Great value for money.  Great balance.  Great classic morning Scotch for those vacation days when you can skip the coffee. 
Cons: Okay, nice warm up.  Now I’m ready for the real stuff… 

This is one of the best single malts you can easily find for under $50.
If you want to spend just a few bucks more to add a third dimension, may I recommend Talisker 10, if you lean towards peaty; or Bunnahabhain 12, if you lean towards sweet 

Mark: 82/100 (range 78-83. N = 4)"

P- balanced spices, toffee, nutty, oak
F- medium, spicy oak"

Palate: smooth and thick mouthfeel, toffee, sweet, a little tart, a little bit of spice
Finish:  medium length, mild spice, malt, a little bit of sweetness

(tried with a few squares of dark chocolate (86%coca)... first try tonight and have drank more then i have should.. lol  but the taste for me was great, stronger whisk(e)y taste than some cheaper whiskys..if that make any scene. so added just the smallest amount of water not sure if it helped.. need a few more tastings.. would i buy again 0-yes.. looking for offer already and i have only opened the new bottle,, replacement is a must with this one .."

4.0,"It has been a while since I tasted something new, but this 12 Year old was a great addition to my ‘tasted’ collection. While I usually only go for peated drams, this one came highly recommended by my sister in law (who’s into whiskey ‘thanks’ to me). She doesn’t like peated  very much (while still appreciating a nice Talisker for example), so she gives me some nice non-peated dreams to try on a regular base. This Old Pulteney was one of those. Full, creamy, moderate sweet. Slightly salty. I wouldn’t mind having it in my collection at all!

It seems a bit bland and boring standing next to names like HP Viking Honor, Monkey Shoulder, Spice Tree, etc... but remember how your mother told you never to judge a book by its cover? Well, maybe she was wrong about TurboTax For Dummies, but she was right about Old Pulteney. I stumbled across a bottle on clearance and was pleasantly impressed.  Although it's not exactly a complex dram, it did not disappoint. Full bodied and sweet with the signature ocean saltiness. Well done."

3.75,"NOSE: Citrus. Gentle wafting smoke like a cigar, not a campfire. Sea salt. Leather. Toffee and vanilla.

TASTE: Sweet caramel, cinnamon, candied lemon peel finish.

OVERALL: Such a different take on how gently smoke can be integrated. Great experience."
4.5,"Sweet, malty, nutty.  Salty, obvious maritime influence.  This is by far the saltiest malt I can think of - it's soooooooo salty, in the best possible way!!!  Oily/creamy, pleasant caramel notes.  A little bit of smoke, but it goes a long way combined with the rest of the flavorw.  I have about 30 whiskeys in my collection- several rare/hard to find.  I want to drink this over most of them, not just because it's affordable, it's genuinely good, really good!  Easily top 5, maybe even top 3.  Dare I say... maybe even #1...  Can Highland Park and Laphroaig ever forgive me???

I've polished off half the bottle now, and I will be picking up another before this one us empty."
4.5,"I'd drink this over water 9 times put of 10 if I could.  Salty, salty, salty!  One of the saltiest malts out there.  Nice malty flavors.  Would be fantastic with pretzels.  It's fantastic on it's own, so maybe I should say that it would be fantasticer with pretzels.  I can hear seagulls and fog horns, waves, and creaking boats when I drink this - it takes me to the see and makes me wish that I were on a boat!"
4.5,"A bit of caramel on the nose.  Nice and malty, creamy on the palate.  A whiff of smoke, but not particularly smokey.  Sweet, nutty malt that evolves into caramel.  Very salty, in the best possible way, the maritime character is readily apparent.  I don't know how I missed this gem for all these years, this has quickly become one of my all time favorites, and it's a bargain too!!  This will always have a place on my shelf.  You will struggle to find a better scotch in this price range.  You might even struggle to find a better scotch for under $75."

4.0,"Some coastal elements on the nose with very faint hint of smoke.  The palate is round and sweet, a decent amount of toasted malt, a hint of smoke.  There is some vanilla with a nice round honey at the center, a touch of caramel, with a dry finish that has dark chocolate notes.  There is a bit of brine and a bit of salt.  Most of the flavors kind of come and go, without any one lingering too long.  There is a bit of woodiness, but not too much.  There is actually a lot going on here.

For the price, this is fantastic.  Even if it were $15 more, it'd still be worth buying.  It actually reminds me a bit of Highland Park, not as bold or spicy, but some of the same elements"

I would have to disagree with others that say this is not complex, each time I try this I find myself discovering new things that I hadn’t tasted the previous time. It is like a citrusy slightly sweet  sea breeze and has a good long finish. The peat is there but I find myself really searching to find it. The scotch itself stands out way more than its label!"

The color is a golden 🍯.   On the nose I get an smokiness and apples.   The taste on the palate comes though as a salty carmel and salt water.  It's not unpleasant.

Mild sweetness on the palate, with wood and tea leaves barely there on the backend. Alcohol presence is minimal with only a mild tinge on the tip of the tongue and a quickly-departing back-of-the-throat burn. The mouthfeel is neither thin nor creamy, just somewhere in the middle. 
This pour might be the perfect entry point into Whisky, friendly and unassuming. It’s like a new neighbor bringing you a fresh plate of cookies with a smile. “Hello there, I’m Scotch...it’s nice to meet you!”. 3.67."

One minute I get big waves of dry Fino sherry, the next I get Dry Vermouth or Lillet Blanc, then salt water taffy, then back to sherry...then a bourbon-corn sweetness. It’s lemony bright, yet nutty and salty...and dark and figgy all at the same time.

Seriously, Google “Fino Sherry”, and if that flavor profile sounds appealing to you...buy a bunch of this Scotch. 

This and Oban may be my go-to summer drams from here on in"

On the palate, there’s chocolate and more oak, before the salinity and citrus notes of this whisky really start to open up on the tongue and finally a peppery spice influence develops. The finish is medium short, but what it lacks in length is more than compensated by incredible complexity. The citrus really plays out in the finish, with the salt staining the tongue; finally you’re left with a chocolate eclair sweetness that develops at the last."

You could tell me it's double the price and I'd believe you. The newer, 40%, sold in a box is much lighter in color and much less flavor.

let me begin by stating that I'm not a huge fan of scotch outside of islay. I would consider myself a peathead, other than that, I stick to bourbon. I don't remember the last time I thoroughly enjoyed a 12 year speyside scotch. but this highland single malt did it for me. 
on the nose you can smell ocean air, salty, light, honey sweetness, no overpowering punching flavors but a whiskey that takes you on a journey. briny, with some light vanilla shining through. 
holds true on the palate, light smoke coming in, good tasty wood on the finish.
this really does open up new doors for me. although I like robust flavors, and this was pretty light,  it was delicious. will get again."

Looked it up on VA ABC site, and found that it is no longer to be carried in VA, so it was 1/2 off and only three stores left in the state have it.  One of which was a mere 2 miles out of the way on my drive home from work today.  So I bought this 750ml bottle for $23.09.  Last one in VA for 100 miles.  I would be lying if I said I am not hoping for greatness.  Here goes . . . 

Poured neat in a Glencairn at home.  Nose is rich, with apple peel, seagrass, caramel.  Taste has notes of pepper spice, mild peat, brine, ripe apples, vanilla, tobacco.  Lingering spicy bittersweet finish.  Interesting and fairly complex.  At $45 this would be a bargain, at $23 this was a true steal.  9/11/19."

4.25,"Tasted neat.

Nose:
Caramel, wood. Also honey and a hint of brown sugar or light molasses.

Arrival:
The first thing you get is a sour apple or pear with a little whisper of smoke in the background. Also a not so subtle smack of pineapple or melon. Then, brine. The saltiness takes a second to hit your palate but once it does it is very noticeable - not offputting, however. I've heard it likened to ocean but this does not have the extreme salt of seawater. Think instead of shellfish cooked in a splash of seawater. Very interesting.

Finish:
Very subtle hint of almond. Slightly bitter smoke but very faint. Touch of black pepper on the tongue as it fades out.

A very enjoyable dram that I will happily be spending more time with over the next few weeks. This whisky has a lot to offer that you might not catch on the first tasting. Would certainly recommend."

3.5,"Nose: Very fresh and prominent citrus and green apples (Granny Smith). Some alcohol comes through (not an alcohol burn though). After a while light vanilla and melted butter emerges, as do a vague hint of something ”industrial”, like motor oil almost (which is much more plesant than it sounds!).

Palate: Light and somewhat dilluted at first zip. After a few zips that feeling diminishes though. The citrus and apple is less prominent than on the nose, instead the vanilla and (motor) oil notes comes through more, as does a slight bitterness (not from oak but a fresh bitterness - think grapefruits). There are also some almondy/buttery notes.

Finish: At first the bitterness lingers for a short while. Then the almonds from the palate turn into lovely notes of (white) chocholate. Nice! The finish is medium-long, but not very strong. 

Overall: Good combination of being light, but yet characterfull. I don’t pick up the ”saltiness” peaople are talking of (ir perhaps that’s included in the industrial notes). The main drawback of this dram is that it is only bottled at 40% and that it it gives a slightly dilluted feel on the palate, and a not so powerfull finish. I recently had a bottle of OP Noss Head, which I’d say is similar to this one (though less citrussy), but packs more taste at 46%, and is more lively. I still like the 12yr old though and I score it a solid 3.5 (compared to the Noss Head which I scored 3.75). If I would factor in price (which I don’t), the score would be higher, probably 4.0 or 4.25."

3.75,"Very easy drinking. Has a nice fruity ending. Not smoky, not too sweet. Good middle of the road whiskey."
2.0,"Seems this is the only place to review this, but I am drinking the now discontinued US edition that comes in at a drinkable 43%. Purchased at under 30 USD before tax. Real shame there's nowhere to score the 43% version separately as the gap in a 43 and 40 could be huge.

Nose - vanilla, caramel, sea salt, light oak. I almost get a dry bread element here and perhaps even a raw dough. There's a bit of a sour element and good bit of heat for 43%. Nose isn't blowing my mind here.

Taste - Oh it's vanilla ice cream and salt and maybe some raw cookie dough. Finish had some toasted oak and just good oak tannin that leave a medium long finish.

I tend to be a bit more of a sweet lover in my whisky and while this has all kinds of sweet notes, it's the salty and savory elements that really dominate this. This however breaks that rule as I'd drink this all day everyday and it's priced so freaking well right now. It's a bit spirity (a bit more youthful than 12 would suggest), 43% and chill filtered and you can tell it's a bit lacking in mouth feel, and complexity is low.

For 30 bucks get this, heck most I've seen it for is 45. If you can find the 43% bottling get it. I'm not sure the 40% is going to be awful given this does have some heat to it, but I'd rather add the drop if water myself and frankly I kinda like the lively bite a bit here. 

I'm going 2.0, but if I were to scale this score for the price, this is a 4.5 rating. It's so far and away at 30 bucks the best value I've ever had in scotch, but I don't think that 30 is the going rate for most and at 45 which i've seen it at, I'm a bit less blown away (that is a 50% price increase from what I paid). I could see this being a gateway scotch for a lot of people due to price and just how cool the vanillas and salts play together."

Poured neat, nose is very interesting. Tropical combo of coconut, kiwi and banana with some vanilla. Time resting brings on some honey and malt. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin at first, improves after bottle is open. Palate is honey, unripe banana, some malt, toffee, oak and smooth coffee note. Traces of the sweet tropical notes from nose. I do get some saltwater salinity surrounding the whole package. Finish is drying wood, light coffee and malt. Its a solid 12yr but I was hoping for a top shelf contender based on ratings. This is in line with Glenmo 10(as stated by Rwayne) and other 10/12 yrs. Paid $38 on sale so value is ""ok ..........83/100.......I like it but Loch Lomond 12 yr and Deanston Virgin Oak are superior imo for less $$ .............still, a tasty malt"

4.25,"I'm happy I was able to pick this up before Old Pulteney started releasing this at 80 proof instead of 86 proof. The difference in expert reviewer score is certainly dramatic, from 95 to the newer 84 score.

The nose is delightful. It is bright, buttery, corn dust, and most of all heavy sea salt/brine. Sea salt mixed with light barley is the dominant taste, with some spice that could be a mix of black pepper and something else. The sea salt lingers on the palate, a medium finish with a shortbread note more common to Irish whiskey. 

Overall I think this is outstanding, and it's a shame they lowered the proof to 80 because I imagine the sea salt is tampered down with additional water. This is one of the best under $50 single malts I've bought. I also think this is very similar to the Oban 14, so if you are in the mood for an unpeated briny single malt buy this first and save yourself $30-40. My friends and I have bought at least 5 bottles of Oban 14 over the years and if I knew about this we could've saved a lot of money."

4.0,"This is the ""old"" Old Pulteney 12. The one that came in the tube, as opposed to the new release which comes in a box. Pulteney has claimed the juice has remained the same, but there is plenty of information on the internet that supports the contrary. For one, the color is different. And, apparently, so is the taste. Not to mention, my bottle is at 43% ABV as opposed to the listed 40%.

At any rate, I've got no basis for comparison. But I have had a bottle of this previously, and I enjoyed it. Let's see if it holds up a couple years later.

Nose: Apple, pear, apricot, orange, banana, and white grape. Honey, vanilla, toffee, and marshmallow. Definitely a sweet one. Less salt than I remember. There is some salted caramel. Some floral notes and oak notes. Not a hint of alcohol. It's easy-going but enjoyable.

Palate: The fruit notes transfer to the palate: apple, pear, apricot, orange, banana, and white grape. Now with lemon. Big malt notes, as well as vanilla and toffee. Some chestnut and almond. Salted caramel and sea salt... there's the salt. Butterscotch and honey. Shortbread cookie. Green, grassy notes. It's very similar to the nose, with a couple added notes. The major addition is salt. It's a nice one.

Finish: Baking spices. Sea salt, cinnamon, black pepper, clove, and nutmeg. Big oak. Some of that shortbread cookie and vanilla. Citrus is prevalent. Nuts as well. Above average in length, which is impressive for a whisky at 43%.

This is an easy sipper, but not a boring. Its coastal qualities distinguish it from the standard Highland profile. It's a nice change of pace to find pronounced maritime qualities in a non-peated malt. This whisky finds a great niche in the vast landscape of Scottish whisky.

If you can still find this expression in its old-style incarnate, grab it. It's one of the cheaper single malts; yet, it's one of the better flagship bottlings out there. Unfortunately, it seems OP has decided to tamper with the secret formula. The Distiller score plummeted from a 95 to an 84. And the internet's whisky experts almost unanimously agree.

Don't fix it if it ain't broke. Is that a cliche or a fundamental truth? I lean toward the latter. I haven't tried the new 12-year, so I won't condemn it. But I will say this. This has everything you could ever ask of a sub-$50 bottle. Money truly well-spent. Pulteney: as a wise man once told me: ""Don't blow it.""

Solid stuff."

3.0,"Old Pulteney tasting event, Sydney, February 26 2020, Whisky #1

Nose: Floral, fruity and fragrant cereal, vanilla, a small notion of briny breeze. Somewhat spirity. Adding water brings out a little more cereal initially, mutes the spirity quality and over time some light honeyed tones develop.

Palate: Mildly honeyed and waxy with a touch of brine on the arrival. The development brings out citrus fruit, mainly lemon and grapefruit, and some grassy, biscuit notes. There is some sweetness to balance but also a definite briny astringency. Adding water develops hot spicy notes. The texture is dry but not thin.

Finish: Medium. Waxy fruit and a little brine.

It’s three years since I last tasted Old Pulteney 12, and this is the first time I’ve tasted it since the distillery did their range overhaul and introduced new packaging. This is similar to the old 12 year, but there have been changes. Whether this is down to natural profile drift or a specific factor I couldn’t say. It’s still 100% bourbon matured in a racked warehouse (generally using re-coopered ex-Buffalo Trace casks as has been the case for a long time).

The palate now reminds me slightly of Clynelish 14, but it’s nowhere as waxy or demonstrative. Kind of diluted Clynelish-lite, let’s say. It has much the same profile as the old expressions, but it’s like the brine and crispness has been turned down several notches. Some might argue that the new version is a little more elegant – the finish is certainly longer and the palate is a little richer, but it's just not as alive.

The first time I reviewed this here almost four years ago I gave it 4 stars. That later dropped to 3.5, and now it's down to 3. Hmm.

“Above Average” : 3 stars"
3.25,"Apple and pear notes dominate the palate. After that comes citrus and a really subtle hint of brine. Also some milk chocolate and honey. Maybe it's me, but I do recognise some sherry in it, even though it's only matured in ex-bourbon casks. This Scotch tastes more like an Irish whiskey in my opinion, but a good whisky nonetheless."

NOSE: Sweet & Floral. Apple/Pear, Lemon, Malted Grain, Honey Butter, Sticky Brown Sugar, Oak, and Leather. None of the Salt I'm supposed to be getting.
NEAT: Definitely not as sweet as the nose would suggest. A little Tingling Heat. Fairly Coating with and Effervescent quality. Here's the Briny Sea Salt I am supposed to find along with Ginger, Old Leather, and Lemon Peel. Just a hint of vague Malty Sweetness. Slightly Bitter coating finish.
SPLASH: Amplified the Lemon on the nose. Brings out some sweetness on the palate. Honey, Fruit, and Lemon Poundcake. 

VERDICT: I really like this one. I don't have the old 86proof to compare it to, but I found it solid for the price. It's right there with The Glenlivet and Glenfiddich, and about $10 less. So close to a 4, I think I'll round up."

3.75,"There is a noticeable salty element in the aroma, along with honey.  It doesn't taste salty, but it has a tartness that blends well somehow with the salt smell.  The flavor is strongly fruity, reminiscent of raspberries and apples.  The salt element in the experience here is interesting; it's mild, not seaweedy at all, and pleasantly unusual.  Overall a distinctive and enjoyable mix of flavors.  I was drinking the ""old"" version which is 43% ABV.  Probably one of my favorite Scotches so far, and a good value for a single malt; I will have to see if the newer 40% version measures up.  Fingers crossed."
