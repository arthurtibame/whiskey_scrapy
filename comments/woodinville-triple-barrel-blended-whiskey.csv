5.0,This is my favorite whisky to sip. The nose has hint of caramel / vanilla  with a smoky oak char scent. Its smooth on the palette but the finish is what I love. It leaves a wonderful smoke flavor in your mouth.  Its like sitting around a camp fire! I find that usually one ounce is about the right serving side neat or with a chip of ice. If I drink more I find the smoke is too intense. This is to be savored in small amounts.
3.75,"Starts with a mild Smokey background. Some sweet like plumb. To me, the finish was a bit like cocoa"
