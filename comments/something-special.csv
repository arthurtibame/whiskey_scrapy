3.5,"Very good whisky, specially for the price. Very enjoyable on the nose, with mild smoke, vanilla, chocolate, almonds and a little flower note. On the palate you get caramel, almonds, oak for a sweet flavor that change into a hot flavor. The fininsh is medium."

2.75,"I should have known better.  Cool attention grabbing bottle and a name dreamed up by marketing nearly always means barely average at best.  This is young and thin and oaky.  I would wager there is no more than 10-15% malt in the blend.  On the positive side, the flavor is fairly well balanced with slightest hint of peat.  I will not repurchase for there are dozens of others available of better quality at this price, and more of the same quality at a lower price."
