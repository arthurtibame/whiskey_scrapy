4.5,"I am reviewing a Springbank Single Cask with the following specs:

Distilled: March 2011
Bottled: August 2019
# of bottles: 288
Cask Type: 1st Fill Sherry Hogshead
ABV: 56.3% (natural cask strength, natural color and no filtration)

Let's dive in....

In the words of the late great Aaliyah... Age ain't nothing but a number.... This one is a big upgrade on the 12 yr... A big sherry bomb that retains the soul of Springbank.. Rich and oily with big red fruits, pepper and a hint of smoke.. Oak, apricots and smoked cinnamon on the long finish..  It's just a wonderful dram... Cheers All!"
