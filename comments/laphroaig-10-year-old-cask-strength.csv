5.0,"Everything that's good about the standard 10 year, but turned up to 12!  Peat is surprisingly not the predominant flavor, although it dominates the nose. Remarkably easy to drink neat, but better with a few drops of water and a bit of time to open up. After 10 minutes it's not nearly as hot on the tongue and the sea salt, grass, and brine make a stronger appearance. The finish is smoke and peat, and lasts seemingly forever.  If you like peat and/or smoke, this is a must try from Islay."

Nose: Lovely nose of dried seaweed, tar, old boathouse, iodine, peat & leather.

null,"Nose: Surprisingly shy and densely mellow with a sweetness (there just has to be sherry-matured whisky in here), iodine, wet grass and rocks, and very little peat!  With water: rubbery sherry, and after time some flowers (honeysuckle?).  Palate: HUGE!  Oily sweetness with an exceptional mouthfeel, HUGE PEAT, medicinal, dirt, earth, mild mango.  It's never as ""hot"" and aggressive as you might expect and I remember the 10yo being hotter.  Massively flavorful with no holes whatsoever and considerably more complex than I expected.  Like a big warm hug.  Finish: Endless.  Fades pretty uniformly, but I think the rubbery medicine notes linger longest.  Final Thoughts: This is a knockout.  It's absolutely bold and in your face while still demonstrating complexity.  Fun whisky; a true adventure.  This one has a very slow pace because of its positively huge presence."

4.0,"[Batch  004/Jan 2012/58.6%]: Surprisingly, immediately on the nose, sweet honey, light sweet smoke and iodine and ocean air, like a damp, cool August beach day.  Slowly intensifying tongue burn that bites hard and hangs around for a good length of time.  Creamy, smooth full texture with small amounts on sweetness on the palate with strong oak, some salt and drying tannins.  Very dry and oaky finish with the cherry and slight bitterness; the dry and the bitter are well balanced.  The addition of water intensifies the sweetness and brings out cherry notes while it dulls the light smoke and iodine. With water, the bite is not as harsh and the the dram rounds and softens out.  The sweetness, like the nose, is strengthened.  I think I prefer  with a splash.  I will have to revisit another time for settle that internal debate (oh well!) [Settled 12/30/14]  Extremely long finish. This is where smoke makes its presence known, ever so subtly.  Overall, this is a great dram to enjoy on a cool, crisp day by a fire.  A sweet, less phenolic Laphroaig. [Dry Glass: Ash and toffee][$59][90/100][Opened 9/29/2014][Revisited:5/24/15; 3/25/16;11/5/16]"

3.0,"56.3% ABV | Batch #007 bottled in January 2015

Nose - Intense medicinal campfire smoke, salt/brine, hint of asphalt and melted rubber, hint of a syrupy-sweet, herbal/bark/root cough syrup.
Taste - Again, intense campfire smoke, black pepper spice, salty/briny dried kelp/seaweed, hint of vanilla/caramel sweetness. Tastes like this was aged in ex-bourbon barrels.
Finish - Warm lingering campfire smoke, slight szechuan peppercorn tingle/burn on the tongue, but could be from the proof. Mixed with the peaty campfire smoke is this faint lingering herbal medicine cough syrup sweetness.
Score - 70/100
Final Thoughts - I found this bottle to be better than the Lagavulin 16 in that I didn't get the cigarette ash nor the level of saltiness I got from the Lagavulin. There was a bit of brine and seaweed, but it was toned back a bit (possibly hidden in the proof?). It was definitely less meaty/savory but to me it was more pleasing as it reminded me of being by a campfire on a fall day. This feels like a dram I could have every once in a while if I'm really in the mood for it."

5.0,"Batch 007 - Drinking Laphroaig is kind of like getting into a fight with an angry Scotsman.  But drinking cask-strength Laphroaig is more like getting into a fight with an angry Scotsman on steroids and speed.  At 56.3%, Batch 007 is a few ticks lower than the strongest batches, but still plenty strong.  Even from a foot away, or holding it in hand while standing around, it's easy to pick up the top notes:  BBQ lighter fluid and charcoal smoke, coral or seashells dried in the sun, seaweed, and, after a long while, vanilla as it settles down.  Compared to Ardbeg and (non-sherry aged) Lagavulin, Laphroaig's distinguishing characteristic is a much lower level of lemon-lime citrus fruit.  Laphroaig 10 Cask Strength has a magical palate.  It begins with a sweet entry, immediately followed by so much brine and iodine that it feels like dipping your head in the ocean with a mouth full of hard candies.  Subsequent sips reveal pickled peppers, some tart fruit or orange creamsicle, bourbon-esque toffee, and flecks of chocolate.  Through every sip, waves and waves of smoke drift around.  Even in its texture, this scotch wrestles with the drinker, epitomizing what people mean when they say a whisky has an oily mouthfeel.  There's a flavorful heat to the end, akin to shisito peppers, balanced by mint, dark chocolate, and a strong oak backbone.  Because of the high proof it can feel mildly anesthetizing, so be ready to ride the tiger with this scotch.  At $70, Laphroaig 10 Cask Strength is a spectacular value."

5.0,"Laphroaig Cask Strength - batch 007 - 112.6°

Nose: exactly that chalky type of paint/finger-paint you used to use in preschool/kindergarten. Calcium salts, petrified dill weed. A bit of umami wakame. I expected more iodine and bandage, as well as peat smoke, but the manifestation @ higher proof is markedly different than the standard 10yr. 
As it opens, s dry fireplace ash, then still-cooking applesauce. It's surprisingly inviting, like your austere cabin home in Islay. Inviting for a high-proof! It's still unmistakably robust (manly) though. 

Taste: the first sips is brimstone! White fire breathed by Smaug! Creosote and a mixed-wood open fire next to a small, rusted iron coal stove... on a goat farm. The burn is quick and clean, passionate and intense, yet direct and ""calculated."" It's rapacious. 
What is most striking once you're past the initial heat of the proof is the impressive and assertive minerality. This isn't just salt (NaCl-): it's calcium, magnesium, lime, and different carbonates, as well as sulfates. 
The palate is crisp and woody, but somehow buttery and dry, like both a young and a wood-aged Chardonnay or Chablis. And yet, the minerals give it such a fullness, along with just enough wood tannin to create a complete (and intense), somehow ""refreshing"" experience. 
The malt sweetness is almost entirely hidden behind savory, medicinal, and umami sensations; it IS there, but you really have to seek it out. 

Finish: the finish is just like sweeping up the ashes of the raging ember spirit that burned down your cottage and adjacent family farm. It's more of the same from the nose and taste, building character in you, and telling you to squelch your tears without apology, but in a relaxed, understanding, and abiding tone of voice. 

Water almost completely tames this animal... at least just bringing it towards the level of domestication in the standard 10yr, with the bandages, iodine, and heather being more noticeable. 
Still, the dilution, sadly, detracts from the magnificent display of mineral composition... like shaving the mane off from the alpha of a pride of lions. 

This is a deep, stern, and experienced drink. A man's drink, not for any puff. But it has stores to tell that you could listen to all night, if you are the type to bare it.

5.0,"BATCH 009 - Bottled Feb2017
116.2 Proof

Dark honey colored, medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel.

Nose: smoked brisket, sea salt, sweet barbecue, seaweed, brine, campfire smoke, peat, and some medicinal notes

Palate: seaweed, brine, and peat smoke out of the gate. The whisky heats up in the middle with campfire smoke, meatiness, sweetness, and salt joining in. The finish is very long. It starts with a big flourish of warming camp smoke and bbq brisket. As the heat slowly simmers down, sweet barbecue brisket, salt, and residual peat smoke linger on the palate.

Unmistakably Laphroaig and absolutely unforgettable. If you’re into peat smoke, you have to try this! If you aren’t, it’s unlikely to win you over."

4.25,"This whisky was purchased based on the recommendation of my esteemed colleague, @ScotchingHard . His review clearly asserted this product to be a weapon of mass destruction for peat delivery, and second only to humans in the “evolutionary” chain of miraculous creations. Well, I’m here to neither confirm nor deny the accuracy of these claims that he, himself, describes as “hyperbolic,” but only to offer, maybe, a somewhat more reasoned perspective to the situation.  It didn’t require a twist of the arm to spring for the batch 8, 59.9% offering, since Laphroaig 10 is my second favorite go-to dram behind Lagavulin 16; but while standing in line to pay I thought, “Gee, won’t this just be a more robust version of the watered-down 10 year old that I already own and like?”  And, secondly, I pondered, “Isn’t my wife going to beat the shit out of me after she sees how much money I’ve blown on whisky this month?”  So, with mixed feelings and after careful consideration, I took one last look at the bottle and decided to………………….just pay for the damn thing.  While driving home I rationalized, “Ok, I paid 50% more for the same product with 40% more alcohol (buzz factor…check).  Now, if I can get 20-30% more smoke I win.” So, with all of the aforementioned in mind, I’m here to report the cask strength, 10 year old Laphroaig to be a fantastic dram and proportionally better than its little brother; however, still not the holy grail of peat smoke I continue to seek.  I rate it a solid 4.25 stars."
5.0,"Laphroaig 10 is the end of scotch evolution.  You want to introduce a timid Jack and Coke guy to the world of single malts?  Maybe you start with a nice blended like Dewars, move into some real juice like Glenfiddich, get a touch of complexity and inkling of peat with Highland Park, get some real peat with Lagavulin, and then at last Laphroaig is the beast at the edge of the world.  There is nothing after that.  If you don’t believe me, put Laphroaig 10 cask strength side by side with an Octomore.  Phenol level schmenol level, the only smoke you are smelling is the burnt bandaid notes of Laphroaig.  I have previously tried Batch 5 at 57.2% ABV, and now have 3 bottles of Batch 8 at 59.9% purchased at $67 each.  This is stronger and better.  Rather than go into notes, I’ll just tell you about my favorite experience at a bar in Maryland with my wife, after which I decided to purchase 3 bottles of batch 8.  MY POOR WIFE: So, we each have our own whisky.  I knew I would like my CS, but it was even better than expected, and I made the perhaps hyperbolic statement, “This is the best shit I’ve ever tasted.”  She wanted to try it, and I warned her she wouldn’t like it.  She went for a sip, and her whole drinking night was ruined.  She was on smoke street, and couldn’t taste her soft flower of a whisky anymore.  POOR BALVENIE 21 YR PORT WOOD: This was a $30 pour that my wife could no longer enjoy, and so it was mine.  How did it hold up after Laphroaig 10 CS?  I thought it lacked complexity and lacked a spine.  Several months later, I would try the Balvenie 12 double wood, on a cleansed palate, and thought it was so much better than the 21 year old.  Terrible comparison, I know, but sorry Balvenie, I won’t be spending $200 on your 21 year old.  POOR LAPHROAIG 10 YR STANDARD BOTTLING: I have not bought a bottle for years.  It’s on sale now for $39, and I skip it every time.  Add enough water to the CS - it can take a lot - and you can turn down the alcohol intensity to levels comparable to the standard 10, but you get a wonderful basket of tropical fruits and smoked fish as the CS opens up.  POOR TASTEBUDS: Try this neat, and you will taste nothing except ash for a while.  POOR PREGNANT LADY BESIDE YOU: you should not have this inside within 10 feet of a pregnant woman.  Secondhand smoke is bad for the fetus, you know.  In fact, best not drink this indoors at all.  MARK: 95/100."

Like smoked mackerel. On the palate you have that Laphroaig brine which I really love, very unique. The arrival is sweet with a very long and lingering peaty finish. The perfect winter dram. cheers all"
4.5,"[12.15.2018] Lots to celebrate this year (not being dead is a start) but tonight we cracked this for my old PI's 60th. A great man and mentor, may he have many more years with his family and friends.

I did not add any water to this, but ZT couldn't take the heat and added a little; he said it really opened up the flavor and vastly improved the dram. Personally, I didn't know how much more you could really improve it. Fantastic scotch, very peaty like the quarter cask and very warm from the high abv. I didn't pick up too much spice because the alcohol probably desensitized my taste buds. But the smoke and burnt dirt flavor would be hard to miss. Otherwise, I picked up a lot of salty bacon like a colonial demonstration kitchen in a bottle. A+, especially if I don't have to pick up the tab."

4.0,"Having cut my teeth on Speysides, I felt it was time to put on my big boy pants and pay a visit to the peaty, smokey, land of Islay.  And since I'm a ""jump in to the deep end of the pool"" type of guy, I went straight for the Laphoraig Cast Strength.  Go big or go home I say. So....let us not mince words: newly opened bottle greets your senses with all the subtlety of a Howitzer Cannon shell landing in your lap and exploding.  You are immediately confronted with the disturbing smell of your house burning down with you in it, medicine, iodine, fresh cut grass, swamp, burned fish, and charred meat. Your survival instincts kick in and you want to run screaming from the room - but you somehow can't turn away from the carnage, so you pour it into a glass, and put it to your lips. This little slice of hell - attacking all your senses at once temps you to sip it so you do. Holy Jesus, Mary and Joseph - You are greeted with sardines, ash,  and iodine, and you are ready to ask what in the name of all that is good and holy you have done - but your perseverance rewards with an observation. Beyond the smoke, is the subtlety of banana, licorice, and oak masked in the oily complexity of the dram. With a drop of water the bouquet opens up and there is so much going on at once you struggle to reconcile the love and hate, the punch to the face and the nuance of a kiss on the cheek, the tart smoke and the sweet fruit, the sea and the land.  For those brave enough to stay and learn this dram, it will redefine what you think you know and what you thought you enjoyed. You will hate the fact that you are loving it, and you find yourself in deep contemplation and reflection of each sip of this dram.  No my friends, Speyside it ain't.  This is a beautiful woman with one hell of a temper. To some she is worth it, to others it is not. For me, after 2 drams, I think I want to know her better, and I am excited to spend some time in this strange and wonderful land that is Islay."

58% abv
Non-chill filtered
Color added

Nose: peat smoke! Also rich vanilla, iodine medicinal notes and lemon citrus.

Taste: full, velvety and rich, with a sweetness initially hitting the palate of lemon cream pie, vanilla, and creme brûlée, wrapped in a cloud of dense peat smoke, sea salt, and hot spice like jalapeño and cracked black pepper and a hint of nutmeg. Water tames the smoke and enhances the sweetness and ashiness.

Finish: long, with an amazing balance of sweet, sour and bitter. The smoke is still there but as it fades leaves orange rind, vegetal earthiness, cigar ash, barbecue, light vanilla and almond while your tongue still tingles from chili spice.

Value: $60-80. 100% worth it. Buy two, actually.

Final thoughts: you need this in your life. This is a cracking good Islay scotch, blowing the regular 10 year old and Quarter Cask Laphroaigs out of the water. In fact, this may be the best Laphroaig you can readily buy (sorry, Lore). If you see it, and you love smoky scotch, don’t hesitate.

Score: 5/5

Go out and buy it now!"

This is so close to perfect from the nose through the finish - if you love peat, smoke, umami, brine, dried seaweed, pears, apple, a medicinal note... an outstanding expression of an outstanding Islay scotch.  I’m not giving it a five because I need to leave room for something better."
5.0,"Peated goodness and undiluted!

Everything I love about Laphroaig but with a higher alcohol content.  It is a bit sweeter than the 10, probably due to being uncut, but it's not as sweet as the 2019 Three Wood Cask Strength Cardeas(which is fantastic and actually better than this, but sadly is only a limited release).  This is my new go to peat bomb, probably completely replacing my beloved Laphroaig 10 year."

4.25,"It’s been a while since my first taste of Laphroaig 10 year: two years and two months to be exact. Since then I’ve had the Quarter Cask which I didn’t care much for. But this - this is pretty amazing stuff. 

This review is of Laphroaig 10 year cask strength batch 11. It’s bottled at 58.6% ABV and pours a nice medium gold in the glass. It has an oily coating that hangs on like glue and produces lots of long legs that take forever to form when you give it a spin. Some watery droplets appear after a while. 

I did not get any of the stereotypical Laphroaig notes of tennis balls or rubber when I opened this. Just a nice puff of smoke and peat. Initially the nose was strong peat smoke with little else; little to no burn. A month after opening, the nose is pretty much the same with some hints of citrus and slight malty sweetness appearing behind the peat. Really pretty pleasant. A bit of water enhanced the citrus/sweetness, but more than a 1/4 tsp. per ounce killed the nose. 

In the mouth my initial impression was of dry, flat smoke. Its pretty hot neat; oily with a thick mouthfeel.  A month after opening there is a noticeable malty  sweetness. The smoke is present but not overpowering by any means. More sweetness than I found in the standard 10 year. Water really brings out the best of this dram in my opinion. A 1/4 tsp. to an ounce of whisky brings out a sweet smoky malt that is just about perfect. 

The finish is long BBQ meat and ashy smoke. There is some brine in there as well. Water helps lengthen the finish. This is probably the first whisky I’ve had that truly benefits from “just a few drops” of water. Being the nerd I am I tend to measure everything - in this case “a few drops” is 1/4 tsp. Any more than that and all that sweet smoky malt starts to just fade away. 

This bottle was $55 online at acespirits.com. That’s a great value imo. I’m really loving this dram. 4.25/5. Cheers!"
3.75,"The nose is more complex than the original, but the flavor is less complex. The higher concentration makes it more rich, and it is still smooth. I prefer the original for the flavor and lower price."

Powerful sweet smoky, old smoked leather, oily bar, cigarbox, heavily charred apple wood, old cedar floor, smoked chilli powder, Korean gochujang, and smoked game meat in nose.
Warm rich iodine chicken soup, charred sugar wood, campfire, scorching pancetta, sweet smoky maltose in the aftertaste.

Bottled January 2018

Rich honey color. Nose has the strong peat aroma you expect, but it actually seems less peaty/band-aid-like and more sweet than the regular 10yr. I pick up the sea breeze, the smell of dried seaweed, and an earthy smell like potting soil, but also caramelized brown sugar, cinnamon and ginger snap cookies. On the palate, there are the intense peaty aspects you expect: band-aids, iodine, briney wet earth, something like freshly laid asphalt, but again less so than the regular 10yr. I also find a strong, lingering cinnamon, vanilla, spicy oak and sweet red apples. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and dry, with a good amount of alcohol burn. Finish is long, hot and dry, with a lot of peat smoke and cinnamon, salt water, and charred sugar cubes. I thought I liked the regular 10yr, but this takes it to another level. The higher proof brings out far more complexity and depth, creating a dram that is both more intense and somehow more approachable than the proofed-down version, with smells and tastes that should not make sense, but work oh so well together."

Nose is light, floral. 
Palate is briny, salt water, campfire, peat, band-aids.  Not overpowering with the ice, and also not too watered down.

I’ve had this bottle for years and have been rationing it out, but we are in interesting times (thanks to the Coronavirus quarantine) and I’ve decided to bottlekill some of my collection.  You never know what tomorrow will bring, so it’s going to be savoured and enjoyed!

I’ve said before that Laphroaig is my ‘go to’ dram and this is THE best Laphroaig I’ve had (so far).  There’s the upfront TCP, medicinal taste but with beautiful layers of smoke, sweet toffee, vanilla and apple.

The smoke and peat on this expression is robust and in your face.  The sweetness is a wonderful surprise that stays all the way into the finish.  At the finish there’s sweet smoke, spice, ginger and citrus - full bodied and perfectly rounded.

Good god, this is an exceptional whisky!  I suspect I’ll never be able to afford a CS Batch 003 again, but hell it was good to have had the chance to enjoy it!"

4.0,"Holy campfire batman. Being a huge lover of Islay based malts, it still shocks me at how much the smoke punches you square in the face especially with Laphroaig. Having batch #10, the abv of 568% will  certainly keep those faint of heart away from this, but thankfully most of us are not of the faint of heart and adore whisky that comes straight outta the cask. 

On the nose: you get the usual beach side campfire that one would expect from a Laphroaig of any kind, but pour a touch of Usiage source Islay water, the character completely changes. Now there is a candy like sweetness that smells of orange peels and tang of pears. 

Down the hatch: Happy to report that I can still see and to my surprise, with such a heavy ABV, there was virtually no heat one would expect from a 10 year old malt. Campfire as per usual punches you right in the face, but the finish is verrrrrry long and starts revealing lots of sea spray with a light sweetness that starts rearing itself once you pass the swallow. Not much fruit on the palette, but definitely worth a drop of water. After taste is long with the lingering iodine which I can't get enough of and reminds of of Lagavuilin.

Must be a Port Ellen thing.

Such a kick ass malt and so glad i found a bottle."
4.5,"Tasting notes are for batch 011.

Nose: smoke, peat, seaweed/brine, vanilla, and a hint of sweetness lurking behind everything.  Slight medicinal notes as well.  Nothing unpleasant about it.  The first time I smelled this whiskey, I got some notes of tropical fruit, maybe pineapple.  But, I didn't get it again.  

Mouth: oily, viscous, feels great in your mouth.  The smoke and Ash comes to the forefront here.  If you like peat, this is your whiskey!  If you wait long enough, the sweetness and vanilla lurking in the nose start to come out.  They are still fairly muted, but present.  

Finish: lonnnnnng finish.  some spice and plenty of smoke.  Feels like I ate a peppery brisket that has been smoked for the entire day.  

I also paired this at one point with some medium blue cheese.  Quite the combination! I recommend it, as it brought out the non-peated elements of this whiskey, such as the sweetness, fruit and floral notes, and vanilla much more prominently.  

I have a bottle of this and would gladly buy this again."

4.5,"$18 pour at a bar, neat in a rocks glass, 59.9% abv, 119.8 proof

Holy campfire! This is wood ash doused with vodka in a glass, and I love it! I've never had Laphroaig, but I've had Ardbeg cask strength so I'm familiar with the profile. Since the 10Y Cask Strength is not readily available in ABC stores, I thought $18 was a good price for a pour. I think this was more medicinal and ashy than Ardbeg. The proof and peat forced me to drink this slowly, which was highly enjoyable. I think I'll be picking up a Laphroaig next time it's on sale."
