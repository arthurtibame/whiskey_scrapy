2.0,"You ever have a song where you disliked both the beginning and the end, but there was a solo somewhere in the middle that just forced you to listen to the track over and over again, because it was the song's only redeeming quality? THAT, in liquid form. I'm not even going to get into this whisky's aromatic compounds, because I think Amanda does a very good job of summarizing it, but I will say that both the nose with its underwhelming presence and the finish's bitter repulsiveness makes this one a spirit you want to skip."
