4.75,"This is a first impression only. 

Smoke is ample but balanced with the sweetness of the malt and cask additions. It’s almost as if the smoke lifts and supports and lifts the malt and sherry to the center. Remarkable dram very delicious. Does not blow my mind for the price, but I’m not upset. Lots of complexity in it to explore over time."
