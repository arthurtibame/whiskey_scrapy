3.0,Interesting. You get a note of the talisker smoke and that dusty pepper finish. From the port cask there is a lot of deep red flavors like cherry or cooked pomegranate. I dro of water opens up the flavor profile and you start to pick up on the oak and there is a pleasant char flavor. The whole impression is like the edges of a cherry pie where the filling gets slightly burnt.

4.0,"A fun, cheeky whisky: seductive smell of smoke, salt, vanilla and red fruit. Tastes bold, with more red fruit (think dark, succulent fruit like cherries), pepper, and smoke, in that order. Very nice, but its youth shows: notes are too separated, and they leave rather quick like a rude dinner guest. Would be top shelf material with a few extra years."

I'm getting tired of some of these expensive, but awful no-age statement whiskys. Talisker 10 Year is hard to find in France, but I want to get my hands on it, hopefully that will be a lot better."

4.0,"Looking online this seems to be a release that is only available in the UK/Europe. This is an NAS whisky aged in ex-bourbon, refill European oak, and ""heavy char"" casks. It's then finished in Port casks and bottled at 45.8% ABV. 

On the nose this is a little hot with dark fruits (raisins), smoke, some floral notes, and (after a while) chocolate. Really pretty nice. 

The palate is hot at first with Port wine, smoke, and sweet orange peel. The finish is medium, dry, smoky, and spicy with hints of BBQ meat. 

Overall this was the best of the three samples. This was a dram I could consider buying, if it were available. I have had one other Talisker offering (Storm) and it's definitely a great distillery. 4.25/5. Cheers!"

4.0,"You ever seen one of those movies where it's just great all the way through, except the ending just falls apart?   This is the whisky version of that.  I got this as my Flaviar sample, all the way from lovely Ljubjana, Slovenia (it's a really cute pretty capital).   Personally, I love Talisker.  One of my favorites, especially their Distiller's.  This one is good, but not quite there as the 10, 18, or Distiller.  The nose is almost like a pine forest by the sea.  You smell juniper, mixed with a salty sea air.  Really can smell this all day long.  The taste is chocolate with salt, a slight smoke.  Like hot chocolate with fire roasted marshmallows, laced with salt.   Almost up there with the Distiller,.  But the finish is where it falls apart.  Really quick, astringent, and sharp.   I'm surprised...Taliskers have a long salty finish.  Maybe it was just my Flaviar sample?   This is apparently $50 for a bottle.  Would I pay that much for it?  Probably not---at the same price , I can get the Talisker 10, which is a notch better, especially in the finish."

4.0,"Port Ruighe. Wanted to try a Port finished whisky for a while now, and today I just got to it. And while I have to say I'm a bit disappointed with the Port finish itself, the whisky on it's own is quite good. Might need to get my hands on something entirely aged in port next time. As for this one, the nose is a nice smoke note, some vanilla, and those dark chocolate plums you can buy. All in all quite dark, but inviting. I still get some vanilla on the taste, together with salty caramel, some malt, dark fruits (I'm thinking plums and maybe blueberries here...thos really ripe and sweet ones). There is some spice and smoke, and quite a heavy chocolate note. Expected a bit more fruit than I got, but it's still very very nice. The finish is a bit of a weak point, rather short, but warm and smoky. All in all, another good Talisker."

4.0,"i came across this at a whisky live tasting a few years ago.  i agree with the notes that describe the finish as short and thin, no doubt due to the younger spirits vatted and the relatively short time spent in each barrel.  but i bought a bottle because i appreciated the approach.  it is exactly as it presents itself - a young talisker finished in port casks.  the signature talisker 10 is absolutely better.  this offering would probably be better integrated if some more time was taken.  but i like the way it demonstrates how a finishing cask can steer a signature expression and it's just a bit disappointing that it was released as an nas.  the port wine notes are unmistakable and provide a really interesting hue on the standard briny, peaty, seaweed of talisker."

4.0,I really like the port ruigue it's alot softer than what you may be used to with talisker but the port casks finish works well with me. The nose gives out a light signature Seabreeze peat that you get from talisker sweet a bit of menthol. The palate again sweet chocolate smooth fruity the peat is subtle. The finish is short to medium with a touch of spice. I'm really enjoying this talisker but at AUD $104 it is a tad experience for a daily dram still ill be buying another bottle when this one is done another good whisky for those warming up to peaty whiskies

4.0,"We bought this bottle in Paris on one of the last days of our vacation there last September, but it's taken me a while to review it, mostly due to benign neglect.  Talisker adds color to their whiskies, so I'm not sure that it matters much, but this whiskey has taken on some of the rich, ruby-brown shade that one would expect from a port-finished whisky.  Port Ruighe has great balance between the rugged nature of the underlying single malt and the influence of the port finish, which could make other whiskies overly sweet (I'm imagining a port-finished Balvenie and shuddering).  The initial scents are earthy and briny, before a powerful wash of vanilla and chocolate icing takes over, and then an enduring base layer of orange and slight smoke.  Compared to the bountiful nose, the palate opens up more reluctantly.  The flavor has herbal and youthful hints at the outset, but the mid-palate has abundant milk chocolate and caramel, along with some more citrus and the first emergence of Talisker's signature pepper.  Talisker produces fairly complex single malts, without being overly challenging, and this one is no exception.  The port sweetness shines through at the end, accompanied by mild smoke, citrus, and pepper.  The finish is more bitter than I would like, but it's a minor flaw.  Port Ruighe has a lengthy coda but doesn't overstay its welcome.  Compared to Talisker's other bottlings, Port Ruighe is more of a sweet, dessert dram, and a solid value play at $60 or so overseas."

4.0,"It’s a Wednesday, so that’s a great day for another good Talisker single malt.  This time it’s a very affordable, NAS that’s finished in port wood.  I picked this up with an overseas order for $58.  It’s rose gold with lots of thin legs and big, watery drops in your Glencairn.  It’s also bottled at the signature Talisker ABV of 45.8%.  I’m pretty sure it’s natural color, but it may be chill filtered.

The nose was sweet and salty right out of the gate.  Delicious notes of red, ripe raspberries and smooth vanilla danced around the glass (and eventually the room).  There was a nice hint of sliced, green apples floating there, too.  The oak came into play if you let it sit longer and it actually added a bit of an unwelcome harshness.  I would recommend just letting this one sit less than 10 minutes and going in for the sip.  It’s NAS anyway, so we’re surely dealing with young juice.

The palate just sings Talisker at the front:  meaty, bacon wrapped raspberries fresh off the grill (read that again slowly because that was my initial comparison each and every time the liquid touched my lips and tongue on successive sips).  Heavier than expected smoke crept in and masked the sweetness, but accentuated the salty bits that signifies Talisker to a T.  The harshness finally arrived late in the sip like a bartender announcing last call and the burn from the ABV is like the moment the lights come on at closing time.  It doesn’t wreck the evening, but it’s telling you to wrap things up.  I actually diluted several pours of this and those harsh and abrasive characteristics faded away- so, against my usual stance- I recommend a little water with this one.  It works wonders for the palate.  Trust me.

The finish (without water) is warm, salt-heavy and sadly is absent almost all of the port flavors.  It’s just a normal Talisker (still never a bad thing).  With the above mentioned water dilution you will get some lingering sweetness.  It does shorten the overall length, but again, I think it helps overall.

So, in summation, this is a pretty enjoyable NAS Talisker.  The port finishing doesn’t consume the entire experience, which is a plus, but that said I would’ve liked a little more sweetness without having to dilute it with water.  The only way I think that could’ve been accomplished would be by extending the finishing time or using older, Talisker base whisky- both of which would’ve driven up the cost.  For what it is- it’s a fine twist to the Talisker line and worth the asking price.  Buy with confidence.  3.75-4 stars.  Cheers, my friends."

Starts off soft and mild and as I'm getting into it it opens up nicely. The usual smokey sea spray although nothing like the Storm in intensity. Pepper, spice and plums come to the fore. I went from 'meh'ish to hmmm lovely. The aftertaste let's it down a bit, slightly short and bitter. I went from 3.5 to 3.75 to 4 over the course of the dram. Its just over $60USD and which is great VFM."

Palate: Very oily, coating the whole mouth with strong notes of smoke than the nose suggests. The salt is not as aggressive, but allows for chili to appear. The chocolate is lighter now, a milk chocolate with ever-present citrus and caramel. The port influence lacks on the palate, but still appears with lighter hints of raspberries and grapes.

Finish: Medium in length with strong oak notes, caramel and lingering smoke."

2.75,"Nose: Full, soft, pillowy and rounded comprising precisely equal quantities of red wine and smoke aroma. Dried dates, dried figs, tar, bacon and earth. As it opens, fresh fruits and oak cask become noticeable. [The dry glass aroma is slightly smoky red wine].

Palate: A good arrival that is equally dry and sweet.  Mildly astringent tannins from both the wood and fortified wine hit the palate and are then immediately followed by sweet grape notes. Fast on the tail of this is a very quick development featuring minty, menthol-like notes, some bitter orange, herbal notes and chocolate.

And that's it. Show's over.

After this fine nose and promising arrival the dram falls spectacularly off a very high cliff, disappearing into a bottomless cavern. The texture is disconcertingly austere and thin towards the end as the wine presence slowly dwindles into ... nothing.

Finish: Stupefyingly short. Some faint, dilute coffee, chocolate and wine in the aftertaste.

I'm not much impressed by this one - it's too pretty and easy for my tastes.  It's all sweet, safe woody notes and muted character, and it falls apart half way through. If the nose and arrival had been matched by the palate, texture and finish I'd possibly rate it as 3.75 or maybe even 4, but as it is it's like watching a TV serial that was cancelled before the season had finished

If you want a smoky whisky with a properly interesting wine finish, look elsewhere. Pretty much everyone else has done it better.

I think the main flavors in the Port Ruighe work against each other instead of creating a unity."

Hello. Buy talisker. In any of its expressions.

Bottled at 45.8%, tawny color.

I had a lot of drinks today, but one talisker Port Ruighe. Obviously this was the best whisky. 

IF YOU EVER CAST AWAY ON AN ISLAND, I HOPE IS SKYE ISLAND HOME OF TALISKER.

On the nose is the most dim talisker, still an interesting dram: port (seagulls and fish stuff), slight peat and lots of salt. The worst nose on a talisker so far still a solid 20 over 25.

On the palate: FANTASTIC. VERY HOT, very spicy but in a macho pleasant way. Oranges, hard salt (that barbecue salt rocks), tabasco and chilli. Spectacular. 

Finish is long and very spicy. Your whole mouth goes numb because of the spicyness. Great. 

Overall i give this beauty a 94 over 100 and it is another wonderful talisker. GO AND BUY IT."
