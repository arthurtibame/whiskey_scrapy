8/14/14 - tried it again - and liked it a lot more.  Smooth, caramel, vanilla.  Very nice."

3.0,"Funky banana, dried fruit, cinnamon, nutmeg and toffee on the nose. The palate is sophisticated with charred wood, leather and earthy notes. With a little water it develops into smokey spice and burnt orange peel which lingers long and hard on the finish. The finish resolves with calmer caramel and toffee notes, giving you a queue for your next sip. It's a quality bottle, but a little too leather-centric for my tastes."

4.0,"Sweet cherries, vanilla, pipe tobacco, milk chocolate and hint of dill on the nose. The mouthful is warm, robust and spicy, with roasted almonds, molasses and hints of melon and licorice on the palate. The finish sweet, oaky and fairly long. A complex and delicious rye that is definitely worth a try."

4.0,"Man that is some good stuff, and reminds me that Jim Murray picked the wrong Canadian rye as Canada's best offering. The rye note is warm and welcoming, never overpowering, with dill and vanilla added for good measure. There are also some subtle banana and molasses aromas if you search long enough, adding complexity to this fine whisky. The finish is smooth as a baby, calling your mouth back for another round. Recommended!"

4.0,"There's just something about Masterson's Rye. I don't know if it's a sense of nostalgia, it being one of the gateway whiskeys that got me into whiskey in the first place, or whether it is a genuinely solid product that compels me back for more. It's distinctly rye with sweet with solid spice. It has more body than other ryes I've sampled and this sense of ""I know exactly what I am."" That confidence is loud and undeniable. This is one of my personal favorites. (FWF share #1)"
5.0,For my money the best Canadian Rye money can by. It has all the freshness and spice of a big Alberta rye field.

3.0,"Unfortunately it comes across as typically Canadian. It’s smooth and sweet with gentle rye grain and spice. It’s just a little dry, and very slightly bitter. As a Canadian whisky it’s got a great profile but as a rye it falls into the realm of boring and underwhelming. Either way it’s not worth the price. $105 in Ontario."

5.0,"My wife managed to pick up a bottle of batch PSA3, aged in American oak. Easily one of the best whisky's I have tasted. Certainly this year. A complex, spicy, balanced Rye. It bursts with flavour and I still remember the first sip and the involuntary ""woah"" . If you can find this batch from this year, it is a must try."

4.5,"Ok right off the bat ignore the "" professional "" review... most here are pretentious as hell..

Just tried this, really wasn't expecting much tbh... nevertheless I opened the bottle let is sit for about 3 min then took a good sniff...wow!  The toffee up front was so enticing....I poured a nice pour let it sit for 5 min as iij do with all spirits..  took my first sip and man a really nice spice hit me in the mouth again with the toffee...the linger was nice changing tastes as I sat there from sweet to a leathery spice...and nice moderate finish and great after taste.. buy this .  70 bucks is a tad high I think this is a 50 dollar bottle..but if buy again no doubt"
4.0,Really smooth rye
4.25,A terrific Rye. It has one outstanding flavor I can’t quite put my finger on but it’s finish is as dynamic as the best Ryes out there. Will buy again.

3.5,"A good no nonsense rye that won’t push anyone away. Nose is just what a rye smells like, light honey, rye spice, eucalyptus, no anise. Palate enters very gentle and light, not a heavy oily whiskey, not very sweet either. Development bitter citrus rind that gives way to rye spice and leather. Finish is all leather and dry. Might make a good cocktail."

3.5,"Few whiskies have wide a disparity between the nose and palate. It has a tea-like herbal smell, with evergreen. But the flavor is candied pecans, vanilla, butterscotch like a classic bourbon and smooth as butter. One that starts to win me over to rye. 3.5"
