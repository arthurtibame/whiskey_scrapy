3.0,"Very long burn with this one. The Sherry is prominent and floral. Not a big fan. Turns down a bit with some water, but could see it a lot better with ice to chill it."
2.0,I'm a islay drinker. So I'm not into a dram without a nice peat. However when o drink this sherry cask it's intense sherry sweetness but I think due to the 57.1% it is over powering. Of course with dash of water it mellow Down slightly. It's more like a port style to me. Not to my taste and for its price it's disappointing.

3.0,"I had a sample of this, thankfully not a full bottle.  It's expensive, but I'm not quite sure it's worth that price.  It's sweet to the taste, and has a pretty good nose...but, I think the finish left a bitter taste.  You can tell it's youth right there.  A slight astringent after taste."

4.0,"I'm rating this expression four stars , but it nearly merits five - my sole criticism here is that it lacks a certain maturity, manifesting itself with a certain raw and off note.

The sherry influence isn't just prominent here. It's completely dominant, giving you the impression that the spirit was infused with actual raisins. It's wonderful, and compliments the additional notes of cinnamon and wood spice.

This one's worth your time."

5.0,"Phenomenal. Beautiful color representative of this whisky’s sherried core. The consistency is full bodied, syrupy, and thick, accompanied with a hefty 57.8% ABV. To be frank, this is a nuclear sherry bomb, exploding with flavor on every taste bud. Berries interweave in and out of its distinctive character, with hints of vanilla, cinnamon, chocolate and oak. A must try."

4.0,Cask S081205022.  Sherry bomb.  Takes well to water.
4.0,"57.1% ABV

Cask #S090612012A | Bottle #099 of 517

Nose - (w/o water) Intense dried red cherries/dates, darkly roasted almond nutty/sweet, hint of chocolate, hint of toasted coconut. (w/ water) More mellow red cherry, adds a hint of milk chocolate latte foam.
  
  Taste - (w/o water) Intense fairly sweet, fruity peppercorns, white pepper tingle, dried red cherries, fruity charred pineapple (w/ water) Nice balanced sweetness, like a red berry/carambola (star fruit)/pineapple sweet, lighter white pepper heat.
  
  Finish - (w/o water) Lingering white pepper tingle, tropical sweet, pineapples, cherry oddly fades and is almost non-existent (w/ water) fairly similar but with less white pepper heat.
  
  Score - 87/100
  
  Final Thoughts - This was definitely better than my previous experience with a small mini bottle of the Sherry finished Kavalan. It was a lot more balanced and retained more of that oddly tropical pineapple vibe I've gotten from Kavalan. Sherry wasn't too cloyingly sweet in this one and it worked well. A tiny bit of water reduced the heat/tingle quite a bit without muting the flavors too much which is a huge plus."

4.0,"Oh wow… When I got this as a gift I couldn’t wait to get the first dram. And it was worth waiting. It is so very different then European and American whiskeys – it looks like a thick, greasy tar. Red-black and almost not transparent. The nose is extremely rich and aromatic.
The taste – huge domination of sherry, plus herbs, chocolate, vanilla sugar and honey. Very reach, very oily and very creamy. And although I liked it I kept asking myself a question – is still a whisky or had it went so far away from the original tastes that it is some different kind of animal?"

4.5,"I've had a few Kavalans now and they've all been yeah not to bad...but. This has none of the but about it. Initially I thought argh its going to be weird dr pepper sweet cherry thing going on based on the nose and yes there is a bit of that going on but its very well balanced by the rest of the components. I finally get what Kavalan is about with this drop. Rich wooded sherry, tabbaco leaves, prunes, burnt caramel, creme brulee cherry and a load more. This is very very good.  The colour is like a rich pinot noir wine and the nose subtlety hints at the underlying flavours without any ethanol blast, nor on the palate. The aftertaste is slightly sickly cherry sweet which takes it down a notch and I dunno if I could drink loads of this,  I'm more a dryer Oloroso sherry Finish person than PX style. Pure ongoing drink ability I'd rate lower perhaps in the 4 - 4.25 level but on overall quality and experience it's a 4.5. It reminds me of the Bruch Black Art 4.1 in a way...profile completely different but a great dram marred slightly by the over sweetness. Still I demolished the dram in record time with only a few drops of water to accentuate the flavour. Very, very well done."

5.0,"Wonderful. Some one gave me the Solist Olorosso Sherry Cask and I just fell in love with it. So went out and bought the Vinho Barrique and also the Ex-Bourbon casks. They are all great. 
The best way to drink these almost 60% ABV solist casks is to have them neat. Let them slowly explode and dilute in your mouth.  Chew on it and experience their superb richness and tastiness. 
Of the 3, my favourite is Vinho Barrique. However, all 3 are excellent.  Ex-Bourbon is the sweetest with nice Vanilla. Sherry is most oaky and a sherry bomb. Vinho Barrique is a happy marriage of both. 
Be warned... after trying these, all other whisky taste too bland."
3.5,"Whisky maturation takes time. Smaller casks and warmer climate can accelerate the process to some extent, but there are obviously limitations. The nose of this Kavalan Solist reveals quality sherry wood, and yet it remains rather hot and feisty. Water tames it a bit, accentuating prunes, balsamic vinegar and After Eights. On the palate… well, this is too extreme. Oaky and spirity at the same time, a crescendo of bitter oranges, soda and strong herbal notes culminates in a medium length, 90% dark chocolate finish. This is way too disharmonious for a soloist.

5.0,Everything I want in a Whisky. Rich and full of flavours!
4.5,"Amazing natural copper amber hue. Easily looks like 20+ year Scotch. No legs to speak of though.
Nose

93
Packs a good punch at 59.4%, but not as fiery as some other cask strength bottles. Can be sniffed as such without diluting. It’s all those lovely sherry notes of marzipan and blood orange marmalade, but carried with dark, deep, roasted coffee grounds. That’s contrasted with a very sweet burnt caramel. Hints of ageing with walnuts and old wood. Very impressed with the ageing and depth.
Taste

89
Had to add a few drops of water to tame the fire. Burnt caramel, orange zest, clove and cinnamon are all very prominent. It’s not sweet as the nose suggests. This is spicy, fruity, and very deep.
Finish

93
Mint chocolate and cinnamon for ages."

4.5,"Kavalan sure knows to make sherried whiskies. This is as good as any Edradour, Dalmore or even a Glendronach. Maybe a little expensive, but due to the higher abv, the tasting notes just appear to make you feel good. 

Bottled at 58.6%abv, this baby has a reddish deep copper color.

On the nose it is amazing. Very complex. Bacon, blackberry marmalade, christmas turkey filling, ham, figs, Dr. Pepper or any Cherry Cola, glazed pork, quince jam. Superb.

On the palate it is very rewarding. A very refined, fancy sherriness, quince jam, molasses and marmalade.

Aftertaste it gets a little rough due to the high abv, but still great. Oak spice, sawdust, slight smoke, quince jam all over again.

Overall this is a wonderful dram. A fancy one as well. Not to overly expensive, (like $135), and it is a good addition to your collection. My score for it is 93 over 100."
