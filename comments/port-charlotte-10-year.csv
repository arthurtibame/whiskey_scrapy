5.0,"Nose: Salted caramel brownie, flamed orange peel, a hearty whack of seaweed.

Palate: Oak-y smoke and salty sea air, paired with sweeter notes of Custard Cream biscuits and white grape.

Finish: Ginger snaps, rye toast, drying peat smokiness"

4.5,"It smells like smokey bacon with peat. The flavor is peat-forward, but is balanced with rich, sweet pork and notes of the sea. The peat is a dominant flavor, but balances the others in an appealing way. It's a lot like Lagavulin 16, but a bit less rich. Maybe Lagavulin 16 meets Oban 14? Some vanilla and mild citrus provide a nice and surprising balance. I find the minerals to make it a bit too much like grog, but I love jts depth and variety of flavor and especially appreciate that it reins in the sugary sweetness in favor of rich orange on the finish. The long finish is really good too. If you're looking for a balance between sweet and savory, this is it! And amazingly, it doesn't have any gross alcohol flavor (or whatever it does have is masked by the peat).
It's kind of like Lagavulin 16 meets Ardbeg Corryvreckan in all of the right ways. It's rich, strong, and complex. There are lots of meaty elements but it isn't super sweet. It tastes much older than it actually is - I would have guessed closer to 18 years had the bottle not said 10. The flavors are terrifically balanced, though there might just be a tad too much iodine and alcohol. There are some herbal notes, but nothing too vegetal. Some saltiness is there too, giving it a bit of a taste of the sea. It's very interesting and very enjoyable. For the price, it's a steal. I might go so far as to call this the best deal in Scotch due to its awesome richness, balance, and complexity. There are tons (tons!) of much more expensive Scotches that are not on the same level.
Smoke and iodine hit immediately, but there are also plenty of sweet, cereal, malty elements. It isn't meaty, but it is rich. The individual flavors stand out and it has a great deal of complexity. Nothing tastes off. This is a drink that is ready to go toe-to-toe with the best. Somehow. The rich red and citrus fruit provide sweetness that when mixed with a bit of honey marries magnificently with the smoke and iodine. The miracle of this drink is that despite the aggressive smoke and iodine it is beautifully balanced with not sharp notes napping it in the side or rough notes providing stocky bed.
The flavor is super rich with tons of smoke and peat, but it also has plenty of maple and salt. There's a lot going on here and for Islay Scotch drinkers this is a paradise. The fruit comes out and so does the cereal. The richness is sublime and there is an impressive amount of depth here. All of the flavors are top-notch and the richness is amazing. On net, this is a supremely balanced whiskey with a lot of delightful flavors and nothing grating that brings it down. There is some implied sweetness that could interfere with some tastings, but as things are this works very well and tastes exquisite. Excellent work, Bruichladdich.
This is harsher than the various Octomores, but not to an absurd degree. This is quite harsh with plenty of smoke and peat, but also plenty of rich body to it. There's more spice than I remembered and it's also more bitter. I like the Octomore 10 better from a hedonistic perspective. This does best the Octomore 9.3, but it struggles against the 8.1 and probably loses to the 9.1. Following the Octomore 10, this tastes a lot more like Laphroaig than it usually does. I really wish that it were less harsh. Watered down enough, the grain really come out, overwhelming the harshness and bringing some nice fruitiness (orange) and chocolate with it. The cinnamon flavor and sweetness are still there though. At this point, this is quite a nice whiskey."

4.0,"This is the third iteration of the standard bearer of Bruichladdich’s peaty Port Charlotte range, and it’s bottled at a higher ABV to the original in my collection, at 50% instead of 46%. The new edition also throws wine barrels into the mix, with a  quarter of its whisky coming from second fill French wine casks. The nose is smoked meats, the palate sweet and chewy, the finish peppery. A wonderful step up from the original."

4.0,"This says heavily peated but it’s actually really quite nice and approachable. It’s sweet, I don’t get a lot of smoky peat - more herbal phenolic on the tongue. It doesn’t linger, it’s a pretty clean and approachable taste. I like it at 100 proof, with a small dash of water I felt the alcohol notes got way more aggressive on the next sip but the finish is even sweeter on the back end. It’s a good night cap, probably better after a cigar."

4.5,"After letting this breath a bit I like it more and more. The wine finish lightened for me; it takes a back seat to the subtle clean smoke and peat.

The classic peat vibes backed up by the richness of the wine finish with some signature Bruichladdich funk is heavenly."

3.75,At first the wine finish put me off. But this stuff rules. Firmly in favour of the new bottle design!
4.5,"This one checks all my boxes. 10 years old, 50% ABV, non chillfiltered and no added colour. This is how you present a whisky! By far the most oily Scotch I've had, sticking to the glass like paint. On the nose I get peat, not medicinal but more mineral, and a whiff of the ocean. The palate has some black pepper, sea salt, sweet caramelized bacon and smoke. I get salty licorice on the finish and again the peppery note, it's medium long. Overall this is a great addition to the Bruichladdich core range, the bottle and packaging are on point as for all of their products. Cheers all!!"

4.25,"A beautiful whisky, the peat is there but not in the Ardberg ,Laphroaig way bonfire way This is not a full on campfire but the peat is there enough to satisfy the drinker that drinks those.  This is one unique whiskey, its sweet with a peaty overtone.  A beautifully balanced easy sipper. You start with sweet than the peat comes in just enough to let you know its there but the sweet lingers through the whole process.  The finish is smooth no burn just a bit of warmth down in the belly. not what you would normally expect from a  100proofer.  Beautiful drinker! As a sidenote the packaging is gorgeous. Comes in a metal tin and the embossed green glass bottle is just beautiful. I suspect a lot of buyers will retain the bottle when its empty.  I give it 4.25 stars and it would be higher except the way its described as heavily peated may dissapoint those who are expecting a full on bonfire. The peat is there its just balanced beautifully with the sweetness. Highly reccomended. Give it a try suprise yourself as I did! Happy to have this in my collection and will buy again."

3.75,"I really quite enjoyed this dram. It didn't beat the laga 16 I had but definitely was better than the weird noted laga distillers ed. It was an interesting combination of peat and sweetness. The peat was heavy on the ppm but didn't have the deep rounded richness of a laga 16 or laph 10. It had a bit of a harsher note at the end but I liberally applied water and it worked wonders; the harsh note was muted and the flavours intensified. Both the peat and vanilla sweetness were quite crisp and sharp but still came together nicely. I'd definitely like to try more of this. Update Oct '19 After buying and working through a bit of a bottle more I realized 1) Whilst perfectly drinkable at 50% optimal flavor and texture for me dictates water to be added 2) It's a solid 4. Nice lovely mild peat but not a great deal of complexity. I rated the Bunnahabhain 18 4.25 to 4.5 and that I'm always keen to drink.. this I'm not hanging out for. 
Update 2 Jan 2020: After working my way through a good chunk of a liter bottle I'm thinking more a 3.5 to 3.75 as it gets quite thin, acidic and bitter. It really doesn't last well. Quite a step down from the Loch Gorm 2019 I've been pairing it with."

5.0,"Tastes like a big brother to Ardbeg 10. Lots of lemon. A little water actually does something amazing to this and I never usually water down. When I brought it to around 46% it tastes so close to one of my favorite Japanese whiskies, Hakushu 12 year. I start getting the pear and light peat. That makes me very happy since the Hakushu is hard to find now and I am down to half a bottle. So, I am now pleasantly surprised. My new favorite Islay, especially bottled at 50%."
4.25,"Slight salted nuts, vanilla, fruits and citrus/orange but mostly strong vegetal notes reminiscent of creamy avocado and latter in the bottle fresh hay with milk chocolate being the dominant force quickly followed buy delicious peat. Complex and Smokey yet carries a slight burn."

5.0,My personal favorite Islay Scotch. It's hard to beat out Lagavulin 16 but this does for me (at least for today). Plenty of Peat and smoke but not over-powering like Ardbeg or Laphroaig 10 year expressions. It combines the peat and smoke with citrus. Such a fantastic scotch well worth the price.

4.5,"After discovering Bruichladdich's excellent unpeated single malt, I decided to try the newest member of their core expressions, Port Charlotte 10 Year. This is a heavily peated whiskey aged in first and second fill American Whiskey, and 2nd fill French Wine Casks. Bottle at 100proof with no color and non-chill filtered. Sampled neat in a Glencairn...
APPEARANCE: Pours from the great looking dark green embossed glass bottle light straw colored. Thick and oily, it took forever to form small, slow moving legs.
NOSE: Intense and complex. Smoky, earthy peat. Only slight chemical notes. You get Smoked Meat, Seabreeze, Honeycomb, lots and lots of Wine. A hint of custard-like sweetness and lemon peel. There is a definite hit of alcohol from the 100 proof.
NEAT: Intense flavors. The first sip is Salty and Smoky, like a smoked oyster. It has a slick and oily mouthfeel. Subsequent sips add Lemon Zest, ""Wine-y"" sweetness (at times almost like it's wine infused), Vanilla Custard, and a minty-like tingle on the tongue. A little on the hot side. Port Charlotte boasts A LOT of peat. How they manage to get the intense peat notes to play a supporting role instead of starring is beyond me. Don't get me wrong, it's peaty, but the peat takes a backseat to the sweeter ""wine-y"" notes. The finish coats with a slightly chemical/menthol-like soot. There is almost an effervescent quality as the tongue continues to tingle. 
SPLASH: A Healthy splash tames some of the heat on the nose and accents the Citrus quality. It helps with the heat on the palate as well. Allows the wine-y sweetness to shine even more. 
VERDICT: This whisky, to my rather primitive palate, is expertly crafted. I think that it may be the most heavily peated scotch I've had, but it doesn't seem that way, if that makes any sense at all. It's very intense peat, but it's hanging out in the back of the class waving it's arms to be noticed. I waited until my 3rd sampling to leave a review, and I have liked it more with each try. An almost perfect balance of salty/savory and sweet/fruity. Price-wise it's $10 more than the Lap10 in my area. I'm not sure I like it more than the Lap10, but it is at the very least it's equal. A beautiful peat experience."

4.25,"NOSE: It’s really unique. The basic profile is toasted sugar, vanilla, petrol, and charcoal, but very intense. It’s like white chocolate. Imagine some kind of delicious cake or pudding coming out of a wood fire oven into your hands. Some underlying scent of dry leaves and wet moss complete the scene. It’s so good you almost hesitate to drink it away.

PALATE: It’s friendly for 50%. Like biting into a sweet and juicy cantaloupe. Mellow candied ginger spiciness develops gradually. Great lingering finish, of an After Eight mint chocolate wafer.

OVERALL: Poor man’s Octomore? Just exquisite and great value too.

BONUS: Try a piece of white chocolate while sipping. Thank me later."

4.5,"Bright shiny malty nose with a touch of smoke. Taste starts with a honey malt smoothness that transitions to a slightly heathery peat, not as aggressive as I was expecting. Ends with a light mintyness that coats the mouth."
4.5,"Color: Bright gold.
Nose: Malty, but weird, I am having a hard time placing it. Light citrus in the background. Maybe it’s sweet almond that malty taste reminds me of. Adding water leads to a cheese funk explosion. There’s a hint of dark berry, as well. There’s a medicinal quality, but it is different from what I'm used to in things like Laphroaig. That weird thing I can’t identify is kind of like white socks that have been washed, but a while ago, maybe.
Taste: Thick. Light smoke, tiny bit of salt. Water makes it feel thinner but there’s a stronger vegetal taste.
Finish: Peat. It really comes in here and takes over everything. I get a chocolatey sense on occasion. It’s very powerful for a quick burst, and fades about medium length. It’s a bit sharper after water but remains largely the same."

Maybe a little grassy?
Slight brine.
Flavor rides into the sunset on an oak tannin note.

Upon entry it's got a lovely oily mouthfeel and you know right away you are dealing with a proper Islay. Sea breeze, peat and iodine lead the way with vanilla and wood spice to help balance it out. Orange peel comes thru on the mid palette as does the red wine oak tannins. The finish is pretty lengthy dominated by peat, brine and oak. Slightly drying but in a complementary way.
All in all this is great peaty Whisky. If you like Laphroaig 10 I think you will love this. It's better and more refined in my opinion.

nose is out of this world. Iodine, a HINT of grandma's white diamonds perfume, BURNT peat, cherry juice.  ""lots going on here"" gets overused but this is a real treat for the sense, hands down.

palate was not what the nose immediately suggests to your brain. For me it was night and day but in a very good way. Sea breeze. Vanilla and sweet wood. Dark fruit orchard during bloom. Smoke is there from start until ALMOST the finish but disappears near the end quite pleasantly.

Ice did not improve it. single cube, glass of rocks, it wasnt good. The ash notes and burn lose all there place and balance and create a very hot a
sip with little I enjoyed. Vanilla completely drowns, etc. If you absolutely have to, give it the white gloves and check it drop-by-drop with top-shelf mineral water. room temp.

I gave it 5/5 but I'm rounding from a 4.5. on the 1-100 This is easily in the low 90s (my mind anything above 90 is best-in-class or dramatic standout), maybe a 93."

Poured neat, nose is great...heavy bbq pit smoke, bread pudding, dark berry wine with classic laddie dusty library book malt and wood. Its deep and complex with more to tease out if you want. Palate is wonderful rich blast of peat smoke, ground coffee, salted brisket and some barrel char balanced with sweet malt and sherry like fruit along with chocolate orange and pancake batter. This is frigin awesome! Creamy smooth mouthfeel just adds tactile thrill to experience. Finish is long with smoky malt, pudding skin and raw vanilla supporting oil rubbed wood and earthy peat. This is up there my friends. Fantastic flavor and depth plus gets better with each pour and time is on your side. More $ than Lap/Ard 10 but you get more imo. Lag 16 takes it so does Oogie but PC10 is in the conversation..........97/100......cheers enjoy!"

4.25,"Light gold in the glass.
On the nose, the peat is unusually delicate, a puff of smoke accompanying a fruity profile (raisins, plums) with pepper and candied orange, all on a gust of sea breeze. Very fresh.
Quoting a well-known philosopher, ""It's a trap!"": At the entrance, the peat explodes on the palate, fleshy and succulent, with an important alcoholic boost that increases its roar, revealing the muscular soul of the whiskey. But it is only the beginning, because the frontal assault soon discovers citrus fruits, plums, bananas, cinnamon and lively ocean and saline waves, well integrated with the embers that continue to burn throughout the drink. Beautiful sprinkling of pepper on the whole, in a not at all boring and stratified tasting, very warm.
Rather long finish, with salt, smoke, orange and cinnamon."

4.5,"A lot of flavor with a long sharp finish. Creamy, buttery, with tastes of vanilla, mango, apricot, tea, and slightly briny.  Does have a bit of a burn, but enjoyable.  Bottle says heavily peated, but to me it’s at best a light to medium peat.  

Definitely will buy again.  I tend to grab this one when I’m happy and want to celebrate something."

4.25,"This isn't classic Islay peat; the Latakia note you typically find in Ardbeg or Laphroaig is way in the background.  it's smoky, but a different kind of smoky.  There is a turpentine-esque hint in the nose.  On the palate, you get a short sharpness right off the bat, then it settles down to sweetness, then it turns around a bites you again on the finish, which is long."
4.0,"This tastes like a heavily-peated, Highland bourbon-casked whisky.  Malt cereals are up front, then proceeded by smoked honey.  This is my first taste of the Bruichladdich distillery, and a very fine one at that.

4.5,"This might just be the best value I've found in the scotch world, particularly for peat/smoke/Islay fans. It's like a middle-class-man's Octomore. Total peat bomb. Oily, peaty, smokey, meaty, aftertaste lasts forever. I love it, great stuff. This is at the ""buy another bottle before I finish my current bottle"" level. Truly tremendous."

4.5,Peaty and vanilla notes
4.5,"I think this is a good deal better than its predecessor which had no age statement.  I always get suspicious when distilleries remove age statements because I feel they're embarrassed to admit their decreasing the age in order to maximize profit.  I love that Bruichladdich did the opposite.  They added an age statement and it's pretty obvious that it is indeed older than than the NAS that came before it.  The smoke has nicely acclimated to the other flavors such stone fruit, brine, and caramel.  If you've had the Classic Laddie you know what's there behind the peat.  However, if you find those same notes in this, you'll find that they're darker, richer, and less sharp.  If I had to describe the profile to a fellow lover of Islay, it's about halfway between Laphroaig and Ardbeg.  It has the brine of Argbeg with the smoke and a little bit of the medicinal notes that Laphroaig has.  Pick this up because it's good."

4.75,"Nose is brine, orange creamsicle, light peat smoke, and wet hay.

Taste is smoke, musty hay, seaweed, orange rind, an oily richness, and oddly reminiscent of rye spice.

Finish lingers and has heat from the 50% abc but is fairly simple spicey smoke."

4.0,"First off, the burn and the smoke in this thing are no joke. Even at 50% this is above and beyond. I recommend drinking this out of a wide mouth glass. Drinking it out of a glencairn is not going to be easy, especially for nosing.

The nose is pure smoke: tobacco and extinguished matches. The burn in the nose isn't ""hot,"" but it's out of a fire that's been put out. If you add some water, the nose turns into peaty melted plastic. The smoke turns into mild tobacco box and cedar.

The taste is pure heat, even with dilution. Adding water here is a must to me, because the heat barely subsides even as you pour a bunch in. Tobacco and smoke are legit, with a dry, smoky meat component. Campfire smoke, with some underlying molasses. Salt brine and honey.

The finish: There is a distinct burn on the lips, not unlike eating a hot, peppery dish. The back of the tongue smolders like it just walked on hot coals. This is a hot, smoky dram. It's Varsity-level smoke and heat, but if you are into peat, you can handle it."

5.0,Smokey makes you feel like you are drinking a campfire
4.25,"Peat, brine and sea salt with iodine and some vanilla sweetness behind it from the bourbon cask finish. Quite refreshing. The peat and wood smoke notes develop and linger during a long finish.
Quality is definitely up there with Ardbeg and Lagavulin, although given the prices are similar, I would personally reach for a bottle of Uigeadail or Laga 16 over this for a touch more complexity in the flavours - this whisky does not offer the tobacco and leather notes within the Laga 16, nor the level of sweetness that offsets the peat within the Uigeadail. For me, if this bottle was 10% cheaper, it would be a much more compelling proposition."

4.5,"Lots of smoke, and subtle herbal notes on the nose

On the palate, Sweet smoked meats, and bittersweet Lemon candies hid behind a blanket of heavy smoke.

Complex, and beautifully refined whiskey. My favorite Islay so far!"
4.25,"This evening’s sample probably has traveled more than the majority of us. It started out in Islay, went then to the gorgeous north island of New Zealand, only to then go 5000 miles over the Pacific, an additional 3000 miles over the continental US, to Virginia, and then a few hundred miles up north to New Jersey. After having been born in Islay, and then to see New Zealand, it’s almost a sad ending to have your last stop be in New Jersey. 

This sample was provided courtesy of my kiwi buddy @Soba45. He sent a few samples, and I pulled this one out of the batch thinking it’ll be a fitting companion this evening as the outdoor temperatures here in NJ are at 40F, and a howling wind outside. I wasn’t expecting much from this—-reviews seem all over the place. So, my expectations were muted. Anyway, I rather liked this one. It’s not an in-your-face peat bomb like an equivalent aged Ardbeg 10. Rather it reminded me more closely to the Octomore 10,  just a tad less complex.  What I really loved about it was the aroma. Pineapples. Ripe pineapples. Palette is a step down; more brine and salt, all the while holding its punches with the peat. An excellent dram. Between this and it’s cousin also from Bruichladdich, Octomore, I prefer the latter—-but that is also significantly higher in price. This is clearly the better value—-buy on sight. Thanks @Soba45 for the pour !"

4.25,My go to Scotch when I want the smoke. I'll always have this in the collection.
4.0,"Continuing tasting my peated whiskys.  As soon as I opened the bottle, a similar smoke, burn match smell hit my nose.  On the glass the color is light, like the Ardbeg 10, and on the nose smoke and citric like orange peel and a little salt.  On the palate more smoke and saltiness, warm finish.  But after the finish, for several minutes, I can still taste and smell the peat.  Nice."
4.0,"Ardbeg Ten got some serious competition when Bruichladdich released this Port Charlotte back in 2018. On the nose, a dusty cloud of vegetal peat smoke, heather and iodine is overshadowing subtle notes of sweetness, pencil shavings and crushed mint leaves. Water accentuates licorice, citrus and seaweed. Punchy, warming and peat-driven, the taste develops towards red currants, honey and a peppery touch of refill French wine casks. The aftertaste is long and intense with lemon zest, dried herbs and lingering ashy peatiness. An efficient COVID-19 drug!
