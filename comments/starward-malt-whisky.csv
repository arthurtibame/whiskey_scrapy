4.0,Amazing whisky for a 2 year old - drinks like a 10. If you're a fan of Balvenie or the cherry finished Speysides this one's for you.

4.25,"Blind tastings are amazing, they strip you fron any prejudice you might have. I was part of a class about World Whiskies, and one of those drams, without us (the students) knowing, was the australian Starward.

This single malt Whisky won some prizes lately, and i can swear that the first time i tasted it, i thought it was a Glenlivet. It is as well crafted as any other scotch whisky,  and it is young. As years go by, it can really become a legend. 

Bottled at 43% it is matured in Melbourne, in red wine and port casks. 

On the nose, Banana, Plums, Citric lemon, Milk powder and Red wine. 

On the palate, Chocolate, Hazelnut, Oranges, It is like its going to release a spice bomb but it just doesn't. Super interesting. Sweet, powdery.

Aftertaste is full of clove and tobacco. Very pleasant. A little short. 

Overall this is one good dram, and i don't believe it is expensive. For what i know they have another expression matured in an australian Sherry called Apera. I will be looking for that one. 86 over 100."

2.0,"BBQ and drinks catch up with Mike, Tim & Ross home from New York for a bit. Almost tricked Tim into eating a 'mint' which was really a pre-dunked not yet moist towelette but Ross stuffed it. Had an alright selection at Clarence's, I went for this. Felt harsh very initially on swallow but softened real quick. Kind of like all the taste comes at once, but good full flavour. I got vanilla, sultanas and pastries. Medium finish. Was good, but maybe not too many dimensions to it. Pushing 3"
4.0,A local aussie dram. Gets better with each mouthful. Lingers on the tongue. A tasty drop no doubt. Well worth a second look which I already look forward to...
4.0,"Caramel and toffee, very smooth and great value"

4.0,Great whisky at a great price.  Typical sugary Australian whisky but not as sweet as the Wine Cask Edition.
2.0,"Standing out for the Australian distillers this is a good example of affordable Australian whisky. Wont be disappointed, for the price you will be paying!"

4.0,"*This is after having the bottle opened for about a year.

Nose is loads of heather honey, with notes of apple, fresh fruits, caramel, oats, citrus and a bit of oak eventually appearing. 

Mouth is cereal, honey, and fruit giving way to bitter woody tannins before hitting a high spicy note on the mid pallet before mellowing out into a relatively short finish."
