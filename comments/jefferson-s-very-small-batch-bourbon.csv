1.75,"Going back to the start of my whiskey journey. This was a daily drinker for me years back. after not having it for over 2 years, here I am giving it another go. 

Nose: nuttier than I remember, pepper, corn meal, sliiiight dried fruit or vanilla. 

Taste: Dry and earthy for a Bourbon, hard caramels, the type your grandma might keep in her purse, and cornbread. 

Unfortunately this does not hold up neat as  well as it did to a cube of ice with some bitters and a pinch of sugar. So if you need a mellow base for a cocktail this will do in a pinch. But as a solid pour, not so much."

2.0,"Jefferson’s brand was created by father and son duo, Chet and Trey Zoeller. Trey returned to his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky after college and supposedly purchased bourbon from different distilleries in Kentucky, releasing it under the label in 1997.
His father Chet Zoeller is a bourbon historian and actually wrote a fascinating book on the subject that was published in 2009.
The brand is owned by McLain & Kyne which in turn is owned by Castle Brands. Kentucky Artisan Distillery (KAD), which specializes in contract distilling, proclaims to be the official “home” of Jefferson’s and mention they distill 1,800 barrels for the brand as well as handle aging, blending, and bottling for them.
KAD was started in 2012 with Jefferson’s coming onboard officially in 2015. Based on the numbers, KAD is definitely not the sole source of bourbon found in Jefferson’s.
This was first tasted about 6 months ago with some friends and everyone found an overpowering flavor of fresh sawdust on the nose, palate, and finish. The attached label proclaimed that it was aged in barrels with #1 char level, which is the lowest char level.
Coming back to this almost 6 months later, the flavors have changed dramatically.
On the nose there is familiar bourbon profile of vanilla, caramel, and brown sugar. The palate starts with charred oak and then changes to vanilla, honey, and mixed berry jam. On the finish the vanilla flavor lingers with wheat toast, and cinnamon brown sugar.
This may not be a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow but at $27 it's still quite a decent pour for the price. If you also get hit with an overwhelming fresh sawdust note upon opening the bottle, I would recommend to let it sit for a bit on a shelf without tightly sealing it and then coming back to it after a few months."

Bottled at 41.2%abv (¿?); burnished color.

On the nosqe it is quite perfumed, promising something better, but not delivering that promise. Grapes, bananas, cinnamon, artificial grape juice, some herbal notes like chamomile are the main notes. Not bad at all.

On the palate, you can find almonds, old wood, oak, vanilla, oranges and little tomatoes (""tomatillo"" in spanish), and a spicy flavor like chilli but in a gentle way. The finish is short-medium and not very appealing. 

Overall it is a 79 over a 100. A normal bourbon, and you can get a lot better drams than this one."

~~~~~~~~~~
Concept:

I walk into a liquor store and see like a billion different Jefferson’s bottles, yet my knowledge of them is minimal. My perception is that I typically don’t care for their stuff, but somehow, before choosing to start this experiment, I already had six different Jefferson’s on my shelf. How did they invade my house?
~~~~~~~~~~
Methodology:

Step 1: Jefferson’s Very Small Batch. Patient 0. Never had it, so a damn good place to start. This one was bought specifically for this experiment.

Step 2:  Jefferson’s VSB vs Jefferson’s Reserve (Very Old Very Small Batch). I already had this one. How did this get in my house?

Step 3: Jefferson’s VSB vs Jefferson’s Ocean. Is it a gimmick? Again, how did this get in my house?

Step 4: Jefferson’s Ocean standard vs Jefferson’s Ocean wheated mash bill.  Repeat house question.

Step 5: Finished Jefferson’s. I got rum, Sauternes, and Prichard Hill. Let’s do this.

Step 6: Blind taste test with all 7. Hell, throw in Chef’s Collaboration. (Seriously, how?) So there’s 8. Can I pick them out based on steps 1-5? Are there any standout Jefferson’s expressions, or is it all marketing? The stakes are so low, the tension is palpable. 
~~~~~~~~~~
Disclaimer: 

Starting this, I don’t much care for Jefferson’s in general. There’s this weird gummy-bear-ness that I can’t shake. Hoping to find my Jefferson’s product by the time this is over.
~~~~~~~~~~
Jefferson’s Very Small Batch, aka “Step 1”

Coming into this experiment, I had a basic understanding of what it meant to be a Jefferson’s product, and the entry level item, the OG Jefferson’s, doesn’t have that juice profile at all. I don’t know what to believe.

Nose is nutty. There’s some faint perfume stuff going on, and I can occasionally get a sweet garden scent, like honeysuckle. There’s leather too. Nevertheless, almond is my main takeaway. Very bottom-shelf bourbon standard or better. Solid nose.

Body reminds me a lot of Wild Turkey juice, and I mean that as a compliment. It feels very oily, with caramel, leather, and vanilla. Classic notes.

Finish hangs onto that leather, introducing a hint of pepper, powdered sugar, and a very bitter mouth feel. There’s some brine too, as I normally get from ryes or high rye bourbons. The finish is the weakest link in this surprisingly good drink, but it’s not slowing me down on this double pour.

[email protected]#.

This is precisely why you never make blanket statements about whiskey companies. After all this shade I’ve thrown at Jefferson’s over the years, here’s one bottle I had never tried that is solid, and it’s arguably the most entry level item in their portfolio. I don’t care to keep this on my shelf forever, because there’s just too much stuff out there. But I like this, and I wouldn’t shy away from this pour. I’d rather have this than most whiskies I regularly see at an average bar."

3.75,"I first reviewed this 5 years ago with no Glencairn. Stopped at the ABC Store on the way home just to see what tickled my fancy, and this was it. Let's see what I think of it now...

NOSE: Delicate. Leather, Dried Apricot, Black Pepper, Toasted Marshmallow, Spicy Oak, with a little Ethanol Heat. With time and patience you are also rewarded with light Orange Zest and Polished Oak.
NEAT: Again, Delicate. Light, Thin and Slightly Oily Mouthfeel. A general Vanilla Sweetness, Leather, Oak, and Orange Zest. Not much (if any) heat on the short finish leaving some Sweet Oak and Black Pepper Tingle coating the palate.
SPLASH: Added just a drop or two of water. It does open the nose somewhat, adding some Floral and Dubble Bubble Bubblegum to the nose. The palate, however becomes pretty one dimensional with Vanilla/Maple Sweetness. It actually ups the Black Pepper on the finish, which is nice.

VERDICT: I have a soft spot for this one (along with Maker's) because when I got into whisky, family and friends gifted me this a lot due to the fancy recognizable bottle. I purposely didn't reread my original review until I was finished, but they are pretty similar. Delicate, not a lot of complexity, but overall a decent pour. As I'm writing this, I am enjoying a generous pour of this over a large cube and might I say, it is very enjoyable. Just pure sugary goodness. This would be an excellent light summer bourbon to enjoy on the rocks when you are just hanging out. It gets dinged a little by it's $35 price tag, but for an uncomplicated drink to enjoy while reading, watching TV with TWTWIRBM, etc. you could do much worse."

3.75,"Assuming these ""blends"" vary to some degree I will make the assumption that my sample is an ""average"" representation of this brand label and from that you can assume your mileage may vary.  

First off there is a lot I like about this dram, from the nose to the final finish the quality is abundantly consistent.  You would assume an 8+ year bourbon should be able to bring something appealing and this does, from the nose of sweet nectars, old leather and honey to the spicy middles and malty finish, what I get is a lot of good bourbon notes and as importantly nothing offensive or out of place. 

Forgiving the manufacturer for the enmity of the meaningless ""very small batch"", the dry middle and lack of in your face sugars make this a somewhat unique offering in the bourbon world.  The vanilla so present in the nose is lost under the spices and cereal grain middle mass with only hints of a meady sweet influence finishing out. Feint mild dark sugars, and a small citrus note also add to the melange.  All of this remains a smooth reminder of ""aged liquor"" void of bitterness carrying through to the end.  

Certainly you don't get the complex sugars from a higher proof offering like Bookers, but there are still pleasant and appealing notes here for such a low proofer. At a reasonable price this is an all around recommend.  Cheers!"
