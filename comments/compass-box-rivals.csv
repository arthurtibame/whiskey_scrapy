3.0,"A rather austere, serious whisky. It introduces itself with notes of pine and sea spray, then hints of caramel as it opens up. The taste conjures up a sense of reading old books while drinking lemon cordial (as one does). The finish is long and peppery — there’s an Islay blend in the mix — with a pleasant dose of tannins pulling everything to a tight conclusion."
3.0,Wish the proof on this was higher. Sweet. Lemon zest.
