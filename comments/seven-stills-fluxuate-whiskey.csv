3.0,Good nose. It is very coffee forward with a good burn.  Decent but would not buy again.
4.25,"Rich flavor, coffee whiskey :)"
4.0,Coffee and sweetness on the nose. Big and sweet taste and finishes with quite a bite.
3.0,"Interesting. As a distilled coffee liquor, it’s nice. As a higher end bourbon, it’s... weird. Porter-infused bourbon fades to highly alcoholic coffee on the end. Very interesting."
