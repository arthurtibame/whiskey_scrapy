2.75,"I think I'm one of the outliers on this one. It reminds me of the Balcones I had... the taste profile being quite full on, one dimensional and artificial. The spearmint profile of which I'm not a fan doesn't help. I got varnish and wood glue on the nose. Taste was better but didn't help I had after Bunnahabhain 25 I guess with all its complexity and subtlety. I'm struggling to see how this won so many awards, maybe like Balcones I missed the glory period. That spearmint is just way too overpowering for me.."
5.0,"This is incredible. So unique, from the nose to the finish. Not for the faint of heart though. An intense experience in every sense for all of the senses. Luxurious mouthfeel and huge cinnamon, buttered popcorn, caramel for days."

2.5,"Non-distinct nose. Taste is peppery, grain alcohol, and bitter. It does bring home the burn at the end."
5.0,"Wow!!!! THis was one of the most impressive ryes that I have ever had the pleasure of trying. Huge cinnamon, maple syrup, honey, and spice.  Mouthfeel is amazing. Finish is fantastic. I can see why it has won so many awards."
4.5,One of the smoothest craft ryes I’ve ever had.

4.5,"Appearance: The color of this increasingly popular rye is a dark brown football leather, with really thin, extra viscous legs.

Nose: The nose is punchy and bold, but so good! Notes consist of cinnamon raisin cookie, fig and plum, dark chocolate, almonds, waxy chestnuts, fresh rye bread, and strawberry Twizzler. With a splash of water, it turns more floral and sweet with much of the complexity getting muffled.

Taste: The palate is delicious, rich, and sweet with notes of chocolate mints, oatmeal cookies, subtle dried fruits, and the perfect level of wood tannins (for my tastes). There is also an ashy mouthfeel. With a splash of water, the taste becomes biting and imbalanced. I don’t recommend adding water.

Finish: The finish is long with an aftertaste of black tea and mint.

Thoughts: My notes here are from barrel number 461, bottle number 38/61 (just in case anyone was wondering). I love this rye! This is Distillery 291’s flagship whiskey and is winning awards all over! I would definitely recommend it and will be getting it myself again! If you’re not a rye person, I would at least try this and then reconsider. Distillery 291, as always, thanks! Cheers!"

4.5,Excellent rye.
5.0,"Starts off with a taste of burnt caramel, not too sweet but balanced. Gives way to pecans/walnuts, with a peppery but smooth finish."
0.5,Drinks a lot like a cheap scotch with the malted notes. Almost tequila smell on the nose. Feels like a really confused scotch who thinks it's a rye. Subpar no matter how you classify it.
