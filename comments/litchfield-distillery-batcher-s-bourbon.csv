3.0,Solid drink. Reminds me of bulleit
3.5,Better than I expected. Vanilla oak up front that mellows. No smoke but taste the wood. For the proof there's a lot of sweetness but not much depth after that as the thinness washes away without much flavor. Bulleit mixed with Maker's profile of sweetness. Quick finish.

3.25,"A little harsh for me, but not bad overall. I picked it up as my family is from Connecticut, otherwise I’m not sure I would have grabbed this one. Ultimately, I’m happy to have this as part of the collection."
4.0,"Silky smooth. Not at all harsh.  Sweet aftertaste.  Beware, proof is 100."
