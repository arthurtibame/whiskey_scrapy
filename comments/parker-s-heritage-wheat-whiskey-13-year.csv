5.0,"This is a must-try for bourbon lovers. Lots of cinnamon and vanilla on the nose, followed by that familiar depth of flavor common in all great American whiskeys. This is sweet and grainy, but nothing like a good rye. I love the color of this whiskey, too. Very unique all around."

4.0,"Alcohol hits the nose abruptly, the bottle I tried was 127 proof. At first hit the alcohol takes hold of your throat. Wheat is apparent and definitely the fore runner on the pallate. Spices come in and the finish is good for the age. I would honestly have Old Tub for the proof or Bernheim for the wheat."

4.0,"Big full taste, comes on sttong with soft lingering finish.  The dark amber color shows off the oak.  It's just what I expected.  I'll buy all I can find!!"
5.0,"Nose is vanilla caramel with oak and age. Needs five minutes to breath. Little bit of citrus. Taste is just, yum. Same notes as the nose with a prickling warmth in the mouth. Viscous mouth feel. Long finish.  Great great whiskey."

5.0,"What a great whiskey.  It's like drinking creme brulee. The mouthfeel is thick and viscous with a good amount of heat on the finish, which is to be expected for the proof.  I added a few drops of limestone water to this and it made an incredible pour go off the charts!  Insanely good!  It's a shame this was a one-time release.  I am guarding my last few drops."

5.0,Oh god. Give me more of this forever and ever. The proof surprised me but it was so fantastic!
5.0,"Wonderful. Long smooth finish. No water needed despite the ABV. If you're in Houston, stop by Julep for a try!"

4.0,"Another winner by Parker and Craig Beam.  An unusual bottle since it isn't ""bourbon.""  Cask strength - so prepare yourself for the burn as it is definitely there and it lingers for quite a while.  A very different flavor profile - but worth a try if you can find it."

5.0,"maple on the nose, peat up front, and a long honey finish. very smooth. Just the sort of complexity to make it easy to approach, but with character to explore"
5.0,"Smells sweet, floral, and strong. Some paper, wood notes as well. Proof hits you hard, but this is a glorious pain. Sweet caramel, spicy, some herbs like nutmeg. Good vanilla. This finish is ridiculously long. This is full and rich in ways that are hard to reconcile with standard Bernheim. Some Parker Beam magic here.  6/13/17 
It's been a year since I've had this! Fortunately snagged the last available pour at No.9 Park in Boston. Strong nose, intense sweet clove honey, some vanilla, maybe a hint of grass. Wow, smooth on the palate, with immediate tingling spice that never goes away, a gentle warmth that seems to crescendo until you admit the proof. You feel the proof more in the chest than the mouth. The floral honey carries over, and some good musty wood notes at the end. Very good stuff. Again, the finish is loooooooong. 6/27/18"

4.5,"Bottle pour neat in a Glencairn at Jack Rose Saloon in DC.  A real find, and indeed a steal, maybe because the menu had it as a 3yr old, not 13, so was priced way under its value.  Nose is smooth and rich, with sweet caramel, vanilla, toffee.  Taste adds some heat and some spice to the mix, and still really nice. 126.8 proof.  Lingering all-over finish with cinnamon, nutmeg, wheat.  Awesome.  7/4/19"

5.0,"63.4 abv. A very special wheater tasting like a liquid snickers bar. Got this at $28 for a 2 oz pour ($14/1oz), a steal considering how expensive William larue Weller and pappy Van Winkle are."

5.0,"Oh man, this nose is just heavenly. Sweet orange and cherry, warm oak, cinnamon candies, new leather, pie crust, and vanilla frosting. No ethanol either for 63.7%. Make this a candle scent. 

Silky, mouth coating, a slow burn. Chocolate chess pie, cinnamon, orange and cherry from the nose, more baking chocolate, oak, and leather lingering for minutes. 

Simply one of the most complete whiskeys I've ever had. It's got it all. Nose is amazing, palate is intoxicating and smooth as silk, finish lasts for minutes."

4.5,"A gem, courtesy of Delilah's.

This is my second Parker's.  The first, the Heritage Orange Curacao, was exceptional.  The Wheat 13 is exceptional as well.

The overall flavor profile did not surprise - typical wheat whiskey notes. I'll skip the details because I would simply be rehashing Stephanie Moreno's review.

But, in one respect, i was very surprised.  At 67.5%, I'm fairly certain this is the highest ABV whiskey I've ever consumed.  Yet the ethenol was pleasantly integrated.  The ABV really intensifies the flavors without creating a harsh burn.  If I wasn't so interested in trying another Parker's, I might have passed on this in the belief that a wheat whiskey at this ABV would be all burn, with the flavors overwhelmed.

So hats off to Heaven Hill!  Now if they could just produce a little bit more of these gems - they're hard to come by."
4.75,"The color is a deep, vibrant amber, almost red, with thin legs that cling to the glass. The nose is a wonderful mix of oak, cinnamon, vanilla, caramel, brown sugar and chocolate. The palate is rich and dry with cinnamon and chocolate that coats the mouth, with oak, vanilla, caramel, fresh bread and a nice creaminess. The finish is long and hot and spicy with oak and chocolate that linger while the rest of the palate fades to a nice sweetness."
4.25,"Just the right amount of spice. Oak and fruity finish. Oak, tobacco, oranges,"
3.75,Similar flavor profile to Old Weller Antique 107 or Eagle Rare with some differences. Heavy grain and oak influence along with light vanilla and the standard wheat profile. Burn that lingers. Less complex than I was hoping for considering the price. A nice pour but not worth the premium and the burn + grain on the palate is a bit too strong.
