3.0,My intuition is that this is the 4 year “White Label” Evan Williams Bottled -In-Bond watered down to 80 proof instead of 100 proof.  The mashbill and profile seem identical.  It’s probably $5-$6 cheaper than the bond but the EW100 is such a good value that I don’t see the need for this UNLESS you only have $16-$18 to spend on a 4 Yr old bourbon.
