3.0,"This is a solid, reliable drop of Irish whiskey. Vanilla, coconut, spice, spearmint, and mandarin orange and licorice on the finish. This seems a little young yet, with more nip and burn than can be written off as ""spicy"" from barrel influence. Enjoyable, but it needs a little more time to grow into its potential."
