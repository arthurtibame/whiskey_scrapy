4.0,"So... I have chosen a special whisky on a special day to write my first review.
Today I have turned 40 and so Highland Park 40 seemed as the perfect whisky to celebrate the date.
Don't have the $$$$ to afford a whole bottle so review was made on a sample I brought back from a tasting me and my girlfriend did this year at the distillery.

On the nose I can strangely pick a strong brine note with a mellow but pleasant sweet sherry background of dark ripe fruits. Kind of reminded me a lot of Talisker 30 but not as refined. Just a little bit of gentle peat and no smoke.
On the palate the brine and sweet sherry give way to peat (come back from the dead) and lots, and I mean lots of Barrel Spices.
On the finish the brine is back, now more salty, and there is also a strong astringency (dryness) feeling, probably from the long contact with the wood tannins.

Not a bad whisky in any way but if you compare it to the 30 and specially the 25, that are more than amazing and cost SO less money, I would not say it is a wise buy.

A four star if you don't take the price into account. Otherwise a 3 stars (barely)."
