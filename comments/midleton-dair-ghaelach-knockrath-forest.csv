5.0,"I’ve not had many Irish whiskeys.  At most, I can count on one hand how many I’ve had.  But, I can imagine even if I’ve had many more, this would be the creme de la creme.  

Okay, so a bit of history.  Hundreds of years ago, back when England controlled pretty much the entire world, the English army notoriously chopped forests across Ireland.  I can imagine if Greta Thunberg was around then, she’d have something to say about it.  They did this to namely to help build the English navy. And to trouble the Irish, who were rebelling at the time.  The nerve to want freedom!  Anyway—- A few forests were left—-Knockrath being one of them. Something tells me they didn’t leave these due to the kindness of their heart...maybe had something to do with the wood being probably not suitable for navy ships.  Fast forward hundreds of years, and this forest is now owned privately by the Brabazon family.  Six trees were felled for this whiskey, with the wood being transfered to Jerez, Spain for conditioning, while the Irish whiskey matured in virgin oak back in Ireland.  The barrels then shipped from Jerez to Ireland, where the whiskey matured in this for 2 more years.  This makes the range of whiskey here anywhere from 16-26yr old.

I had the fortunate opportunity to try 4 of these samples: tree 2, 3, 5, 6.  Thanks to a family member that bought back a few samples from Dublin.  Tree 2, 3, 6 had very subtle differences, honestly couldn’t tell them apart.  But tree 5 was different, not sure what was up with that one.  

Tree 2,3,6:  tons of vanilla, tropical fruit basket galore.  The fruit was heavy in pineapples and green tart apples.  Just simple amazing.  

Tree 5:  this one was different.  Had a rancio effect, almost like really good cognac.  Much more earthy and herbal.  The fruit was there, but the earthy -rancio was forefront and bold.  

Out of the 4 I’ve tried, hands down my favorite was tree 5.  Just layers of complexity over the others.  All were amazing, but 5 gave a special something over the others.  

I’m keeping an eye out for this...if you have one Irish, make it this one."
