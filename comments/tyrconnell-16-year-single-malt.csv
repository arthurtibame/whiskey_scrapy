4.75,"Chose this over the Bushmills 16 as it was cheaper and at 46% ABV. Bushmills is close to $120 and only 40% ABV. Note that this was based on a neck pour.

Nose: Candied fruit, butterscotch, vanilla, cinnamon oatmeal/grahm cracker.

Taste: Much like the nose with the fruits and bourbon influences coming through. Oily and creamy mouthfeel.

Finish: Citrus, champagne?, grahmcracker, coconut, oak dryness.

Well balanced and I can only wonder what it will be like as it opens up."

4.75,"The most fresh fruit notes I've ever had in any whisk(e)y! Nose matches palate, and is very sweet with notes of fresh cantalope, pears, apples, oranges, candied oranges, fresh and artificial watermelon, non-commercial strawberries, hints of lime juice and lemon zest, a faint suggestion of honey dew and some indescript tropical fruits. Also noted, is candied ginger, sweet tarts, and minerals. It is also buttery, savory, and floral, with heavily toasted dry Irish barley, light clover honey, and not much vanilla or chocolate, (the typical bourbon barrel imparts take a backseat to the other notes mentioned). There's a touch of smokiness that's unique and different from peat smoke or campfire smoke, it's a sweet, almost foody kind of smoke. Incredibly complex. The entry on the palate is very, very fruity and very, very sweet; especially after opening up, perhaps too sweet for some! Candied oranges in the middle, dry toasted barley and dry cereal notes pull the sweetness back near the medium-long finish and work out the balance, with a small explosion of barrel spice near the end at an approachable level that is not too hot. Lingering aftertaste of lime, minerals, honey, and oak. Just a tiny bit woody during the finish unless a very small amount of water is added, (it is somewhat over-oaked and slightly bitter on the finish otherwise-- however, this goes away after a few months after opening). All in all, quite memorable and attractive. Somewhat oily somewhat syrupy body that is also a bit tannic, even the body is nicely balanced and actually becomes more syrupy and oily and less tannic with just a few drops of water. Despite the light, sweet profile with all those fruity notes, this is a full flavored middleweight overall and a heavyweight in terms of Irish malts. High quality. It's enjoyable at first, but really blossoms beautifully after a few short months of occasional, small pours. You'll be in Heaven when you reach the heart of the bottle, so long as you don't rush getting there. This bottle was a gift, but I would buy another at $99.95 without much hesitation-- though I'd have to decide on this 16, the 15 y.o. Madeira finished, or the 16 y.o. Oloroso/muscatel finish for the same price. I haven't tried the others I mentioned, but this is the best Irish single malt I've had in recent years, and is my current favorite. Very highly recommended, so long as you don't mind adding a few drops of water at first."
4.75,Very long and sweet finish full bodied whisky.
4.25,"I tend to like my whiskey like I like my men; a little on the younger side. But the 16 years on this Irish single malt is elegant and adult. Finished in my beloved oloroso and PX barrels, I love the complex nose full of gingerbread and sun baked grain. I love the taste warm Irish sunshine. The taste brings me back to summer days in Phoenix Park."

4.25,"The nose has beautiful, light fruity aromas, honeycomb, shortbread sugar cookies, lemon zest and vanilla, which gives the impression of lemon cake.  There’s also hints of fresh squeezed orange juice and spicy cedar wood.
-
To the palate it has a light fruity sweetness accompanied by complex spices and wood flavours.  Orange juice, orange peel, honey, pears, light cereal malt and vanilla.
-
The finish is rich and oily, with continuing notes of wood spice along with the gentle sweetness.  Dry oak with a slight smoky barrel char lingering at the end.

I really like this one!  Also, it went very well with the dark, earthy spice of the cigar.  I will definitely be interested in trying more expressions of this lovely Irish Single Malt!"
