3.0,"Bought this tonight. After OSU beat Bama it seemed an ironic drink for the national championship game tonight since it was branded ""Roll Clyde"". 

Frankly, this was a fair quality whiskey - as advertised. Applewood lingers throughout but I'm not sure I want to know how it got there. This smells and tastes of cheap corn and rye whiskey touched up with some finer flavors. Aging six years gives enough oak flavor and spice to redeem this whiskey and keep it on my shelf."

3.0,Couldn't detect any apples in it but tasted light and floral with a hint of spice. Solid every man's bourbon.
2.0,I was excited to try a new type of whiskey and the back story. Unfortunately it seemed to be a gimmick. This should not be labeled as whiskey. It taste like sour ape puckers mixed with Canadian club. Not a fan. I am open to trying new things but this is clearly trying to take advantage of the apple success. It taste like they use jolly ranchers for flavoring. Horrible after taste.

3.0,"Mahogany color that under light, reveals beautiful orange highlights. Almonds and sweet apples on the nose. Reminds me of a liqueur.  Soft palate with wood spice, sour apple, and nuts.  A lasting burn, but not much else continuing.  The whiskey loses its nutty integrity after the bottles been open for a few weeks.  Addition of a few drops of water cuts all the bite and gives it a soft smooth sweetness.  Initially I was not quite fond of this, but further tastings redeem.  I think this would make a great mixer with its unique flavor profile."

4.0,"While I grew up in Texas, my family has antebellum roots in Alabama, so I had to give the ""Alabama style"" whiskey a whirl...and I'm glad I did! In some ways, I'm reminded almost more of scotch than bourbon by the nose - apples, baking spice, vanilla, caramel...this wouldn't be out of place in Speyside. The palate reminds you which side of the Atlantic this whiskey was produced on, but only so much - while there's plenty of good, bourbony caramel corn and vanilla, with a little bit of rye spice, a smooth, creamy apple-cinnamon quality comes through, as well. It's unique, priced well, and worth trying if you get the chance; I'll happily drink this neat, but I can also see lots of cocktail potential here, too."

4.0,"Just tried this. And I was not expecting much to be honest. I have tried, and like the Clyde Mays 101.. jot hot but good. So I open this cool looking bottle. Picture of Clyde Mayes leaning against Clyde 240.... open and let it air for a minute. Pour the dram, and it is as dark as molasses. I'm thinking ok this is going to be way too sweet.  At 92proof I put some filter water in it and let it sit for about 7 min. Nose told me a complete lie to my tongue... I had whiffs of vanilla  [duh] and some but not much sugar.. So I taje my sip expecting vinillia and brown sugar-he in is the lie. I taste none of these instead my mouth exploded with joyess taste of spice and nutmeg.. tge finish was so dry it was like drinking a dry red wine. The spice remixed reminded me of High WEST rye. OMG I love me some rye and I love this drink. There is a molasses stickiness to the mouth feel but it disappears before it wears out it's welcome. I paid 38.00 for this and man I'm going to get another. Old fashion lovers will just a dog this. Give it a try"

4.0,"Thanks to @The_Rev , I got to try my first Alabama whiskey.  Honestly, I was expecting something closer to moonshine...just  knowing that Clyde May was a moonshiner.  I was dead wrong. This is more a mix of the heather / honey of a Speysider with the corn sweetness of a Kentucky bourbon.  Thanks @The_Rev !"

3.0,"It seems this standard entry from Clyde Mays has no age statement. Conecuh Ridge Distillery certainly gets style points for this labeling, their bottles are not short on ornamental print.   Stephanie's notes seem fairly accurate on this 85 proof table whiskey, I found at the local bar.

The nose on this is strong with notes of mint, anise, dill, ginger perhaps just a hint of sweet apple cinnamon, if you didn't know otherwise you might think this was a 'flavored' product.

On the palate very little sweetness, the dryest of vanilla but no caramel sugars appear.  Indeed the entire profile is a dry but somewhat traditional  whiskey with just some hints of warm spice and bits of corn sugars popping up on the way out.   Not a big finish at all but also not unpleasant or acrid with tannins, it seems relatively smooth.   Some barrel nibs finalize the experience. 

Well nobody ever said Alabama was the ""other"" whiskey state, but this isn't a bad representation at all, however it is unfortunate that the rather hefty nose of spices are all but missing in the actual taste.   Again for an entry level not bad but nothing special either.   Until I get a try of the bourbon and barrel versions for comparison, this is neither a home run or a swing and a miss,  I'd say more a safe base hit.

Definitely a try before you buy a bottle recommendation."

First, this whisky smells like sweet apple candy and cider. The taste is quite similar too. It is extremely smooth and tastes of sweet apple juice and cinnamon. The closest comparison I can make is the taste of Australian apple licorice candy."

4.0,"Hope the world finds you well. 
Crisp Apple notes with light refreshing body. Almost cedar wood notes. Close your eyes and you will see the seeds and core of the apple. Corn and vanilla way in the background, off to the side. 

Light viscosity. Quick heat fast cool down over the tongue keeping the apple going then changing to pear at the back of the throat where light heat comes back, stays a bit numbing then little to no finish."

Apples again right up front on the taste but quickly the bourbon like spice washes that away then waves of cream and caramel mix around. Was pleasantly surprised by this. Warm is a great way to describe this. Great for winter sipping or a flask."
