4.0,"I like this, not a huge fan of single grain Irish whiskey but to me this, despite the lower rating is a far better whiskey than the teeling single grain offering. It's very light and easy to drink but has something nice to offer. This is best to have neat with little or no water."

2.0,Nose is very sweet with notes of vanilla and perhaps maple. The maple sweetness continues on as I drink. The overall palate is light and not very complex. The finish is pretty dry and leaves me with something to be desired.

2.75,"Many malt drinkers tend to overlook grain whiskies, although they can offer a nice variation in smell and taste. Kilbeggan 8-year-old is column-distilled from corn and matured in ex-bourbon casks, giving it a sweet, biscuity and slightly dusty nose. Vanilla, coconut cream and hints of lavender stick out in particular. The palate evolves sugary, aromatic and a little spirity with notes of walnuts, breakfast cereals and citrus fruits. A touch of wood spice accompanies the short finish. This is not an Irish whiskey to wax poetic about, but I have certainly tried worse.

3.0,"Week Two of my Irish whiskey Advent gets kicked off by this offering. First, kudos for giving it an age statement despite its youth - they could have easily opted for some fancy marketing BS instead, but they didn't. And, it's worth saying, this is a mature-feeling eight year old whiskey - there's not a lot of new spirit burn present. That being said, it's a bit of a lightweight in ways both good and bad. Positively, it's refreshingly gentle - as bright and airy as a warm spring day, with the smell of hay and a few wildflowers on the breeze. However, the delicacy comes without much in the way of complexity or interesting flavors. It's the whiskey equivalent of a 71*F, sunny day in late May...sure, it's hard not to enjoy, but it's the kind of weather that doesn't feel like weather. There is no ""there"" there. One to add to my ""happy to drink if given to me, unlikely ever to spend money on"" file."
3.0,Ok
