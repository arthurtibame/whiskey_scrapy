3.0,"Went to a Del Bac tasting tonight with their brand ambassador. Tried several of their expressions and I can say that each of their expressions has a unique flavor profile. 

This is truly unique new make! It has the creaminess of the barley and some smoke on the nose, but also on the nose is some vegetal mezcal funk. The finish is short it smooth without any of the burn you’d think there’d be with new make."
3.5,Clear whiskey is just not right.  There is something I don’t like about the lack of wood sugars.   That being said this still packs a Smokey punch but without the caramel and oak and vanilla it seems incomplete.
3.5,"This bad boy is all smoke, from start to finish. There's a sweetness from the barley that I find familiar from Irish drams that finishes nicely. There's obviously no wood tannins so it's missing that aspect of it making it a more simple drink good for mixing. It makes a hell of a smokey Coke or old fashioned, and if you're a peat head, it's great for sipping."
