3.0,"Nose: Heavy charcoal peat smoke dominates, but there's also fruit (pear and green apple) and a chocolate note.  

Taste: Viscous for 46.3% abv and smoke smoke smoke! As it develops the apple along with a hint of chocolate-covered cherry come in.

Finish: Medium, with a oak, smoke char, peat smoke, chocolate, raisin and slight nuttiness. On the tail end is a sour funkiness I can't quite describe but isn't very pleasant. 

Value: $65 USD; overpriced for what you get.

Final Thoughts: Glad I got to try this unique NAS pour from Bunnahabhain, but compared to other peated single malts at the price point, this one fades in the face of the competition. It's got a bit of that classic Bunna profile but it's youth is evident.

Score: 3/5 Try or buy at a good price

Cheers to @LeeEvolved for sharing this sample with me!"
4.0,"Note, this is for the current Moine. This is a nice, balanced Islay whisky. I was impressed given that Bunnahabhain usually does unpeated expressions. It features smoke, seasalt, medicinal notes and a bit of tar on the nose. Similar notes on the palate, but sweeter than one might expect. Good stuff."

4.0,"This note is for the normal current 46.3 Moine. Peated smoke, lots of taste, dry finish and ash tray and liquirice. Far better now than when I first tried it."
3.0,"this is a note for the current 46.3 Moine. Now i understand why it is that cheap on dutch websites. 
As some have already put it here, maybe Bunnahabhain should leave the peat to the real specialists on Islay. 
This is ok for 30€, but dont spend 60€ on MofM."

3.0,"This review is for the re-release of the Moine NAS from Bunnahabhain.  This re-issue comes in at 46.3% ABV and not the near cask strength 59%.  This is a peated Bunna and is pale gold and oily in the Glencairn.  It also makes some heavy, watery droplets and thick, runny legs in the glass.

The nose is predominantly chimney smoke and ripe, green apples.  There’s a funky, sugary syrup flavor mingling in as well, with some charred oak and salty air qualities.  The palate is salty and smoky, with green apples and pears dominating the flavor profile.  A hint of fudge appears mid sip.  The finish is long, hot and somewhat harsh.  There’s chili pepper spice and light menthol notes that linger around once the sip is complete.  

Overall, it definitely seems young, spirit wise and the flavors don’t seem to meld as well as I had hoped.  The smoke notes are fine, but don’t hold a candle to other Islay malts (obviously).  While I’m glad that Bunnahabhain makes a peated whisky from time to time, part of me wishes they’d just let the experts on Islay do it and do it right.

As is, this is a 2.75-3 star dram and I payed around $70 for this bottle.  Not super expensive, but not really a great deal for what’s in the bottle, either.  Stick to the regular peat distillers on Islay.  Cheers."
