5.0,Picked this up for my father in law (who is an avid bourbon & whiskey drinker) at the recommendation of my local wine & liquor shop store owner. We opened the bottle and tasted it with the whole family. We looked up the history of the brand online and enjoyed reading the story and talking about the different tasting notes. Would definitely recommend.
