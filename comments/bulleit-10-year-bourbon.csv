4.0,It tastes a bit better than regular Bulliet but it costs a bit more. Not sure it's worth the trade off when there is so much more in the same price category
4.0,One of my favorite bourbons.

4.0,"I would give this a 3.5 if I based purely on quality but will slide to a three instead of a four because it is a little more expensive than some other bourbons that I think are a little better at a lower cost.  Buffalo Trace for instance.  I think this is best served with a cube of ice.  The flavors are nice but perhaps a bit muted.  Brown sugar, toasted corn flakes, and a little custard are what I'm getting out of it.  The custard seems to hold on the longest, which is a good thing.
Now that I've reached the bottom of the bottle, I'm going to bump to a 4, since I seem to be enjoying."
4.0,Super smooth and not ridiculously pricey for a ten year.

3.0,"My brother had gifted me a bottle of this a few months back. He knows I enjoy the rye sibling, so why not the ten year? Although this ten year is certainly a more curbed version of the Bulleit  family, it remains a bit underwhelming. Vanilla and spice make headway and are the center pieces. Dates later accompany a smooth finish. Fortunately, I still love my brother for the gift of whiskey. Unfortunately, this particular bourbon lacks boldness and fails to elaborate."
3.0,"The best way I can think to sum up this bourbon is something like this: imagine you have a friend and you go way back. You treasure that friendship until you find out one day that he sold the PlayStation you lent him for college along with all your games. You then realize that your history is sorted at best and you begin to see that your friendship has a lot of holes you've just been ignoring for the past 6 years. Ouch.

This bourbon is like that. You're captivated for a moment with its character, then all of a sudden the proof punches you in the throat out of nowhere. ""That's odd"" you think to yourself and you take another sip, this one totally enjoyable. You laugh at yourself saying ""see? We're totally fine!"" That's when you next sip chokes you, then steals and sells your favorite vintage Journey tee. 

This was inconsistent and too harsh at times for me to enjoy as much as I wanted to. (FWF share #4)"

4.0,"It has been awhile since I've had Regular Bulleit so I cannot compare reliably. More of the oak and caramels than I remember with the Regular and the rye seems less noticeable on initial taste. Very enjoyable. Large fast tails. The initial taste is barrel. The rye pepper kicks in nicely after and fades after swallowing. 

May not be an always-have in my cabinet but will be a has-often."

3.0,"This has got to be some kind of Four Roses.  Tasting this side by side with Four Roses Small Batch or Single Barrel would be an interesting exercise.  The combination of floral, fruity, and spicy characteristics is almost a dead ringer for that distillery’s offerings, but this is a clear case of just buying from the source in my book.  The stunning Four Roses Single Barrel is basically the same price, comes at a higher ABV, and is just flat out better.  Combined with the hit that Bulleit’s taken recently due to a controversy over the family’s treatment of their daughter Hollis (look it up), I don’t see myself ordering this one again."

Has pretty much everything I'm looking for in a bourbon other than being barrel proof...That being said I'd pay triple for a full strength single barrel version of this at least.  For the time being this is essentially a four roses product (I think?)...Who knows what the future holds, but as long as it tastes this good it will always be in my cabinet.   It's earthy with a lot of cinnamon and clove, followed by vanilla, cherry and oak char.   Very good!"

The prickly spice is unusual. I detect no cinnamon or firehots, but rediscovered the pleasant sweetness from sip one. The aftertaste is a little odd. I can’t decide if it’s prunes or green plants. I’m not especially fond of either.  Sip 4: I like it. The flavor profile is short at the front and builds to the back. The downside is the odd aftertaste."

4.0,"On the nose is sweet toffee, cherry hard candy, rye, oak and a hint of black tea with subtle chai spices.  Given time I start picking up some rich, worn leather and some grassy, herbal and mint notes.
-
To the palate it has a soft sweetness with oak wood throughout, chai tea, maple syrup, grassy herbs, spicy rye, and a subtle hint of that cherry candy.
-
The finish presents some subtly smoky barrel char and dry oak flavours.  Leather and subtle spices linger, with some memory of that toffee sweetness.
—
With some water added, the nose presents a more sweet wood note and enhanced herbal rye aromas.  The palate becomes very dry, melding the oak, spice and herbal notes together, with only the lightest sweetness.  I find a sort of sour wood note in the finish with some orange peel bitters.

Bourbon Mark:  89

I think I really like this one.  That added age brought some added complexity and nice oak dryness that I’m enjoying.  Comparing side-by-side with standard Bulleit Bourbon, they are remarkably similar, but there is a noticeable difference in sweetness, and oak flavour."

3.75,"First sampling of a Bulleit whiskey. At a price point of $35, I decided to not mess around with the entry level product and just jump straight to the 10 year. 

Really nice nose on this one; getting caramel dipped green apple, snickerdoodle cookie, and lots of ""baking spices"" by which I mean nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, ginger, and clove, in that order. 

On the palate it matches the nose almost exactly with apple and spices leading the way so I can't say I'm picking out any notes that weren't already described above. Reminds me of autumn in a good way.

Medium length finish of rye and yet more baking spices with the addition of some toasted oak, but far less than I would imagine from 10 years in the barrel. 

I would describe this as a very ""traditional"" bourbon. You aren't going to get a ton of complexity here or anything unique to write home about; just solid, well crafted juice at a reasonable price point. Re-buy at this price but probably not so if it were much more. Based on this I am looking forward to trying the barrel strength version."

For 40$ it’s not something I’d buy everyday when you can get other good 10 years for less, but it is an extremely solid bourbon and I’d highly recommend to anyone who likes rich, sweet, vanilla-forward bourbons."

4.0,"It may sound strange but I can’t quite put my finger on the nose. To me it is like a very sweet ethanol, not at all unpleasant, almost like a sweet candy. I may be dating myself but for a second I thought of the old pink chocolate filled “chicken bones” candy growing up. The body was light and smooth and the finish was like I just took a whiff of a fall potpourri and all the spices that go with it. Overall very enjoyable and something I feel is perfect for a crisp fall night up here in New England."

3.0,"Im not the biggest fan of the standard issue but hey 10yr age statement gotta be worth something right, Poured neat, nose is great. Deep rich caramel wrapped oak with light rye spice and no ethanol. Lightly toasted marshmallow and white cake batter provide a delicate sweetness. Its smooth and sophisticated without off notes.  Palate brings vanilla crème donut imbedded in oak. Some rye spice checks in with a bit of floral note. Its all a bit thin however and does not live up to the delightful aroma. Finish is dry barrel...real dry with fading sweet and spicy notes. Imagine dipping a few toothpicks in caramel then chewing them up. Its the heavy lumber sensation that drags this bourbon down imo. Overall its better than the regular Bulleit but not worth the extra $  imo. 81/100..... expected more from a 10 yr"

4.0,"Loving what the barrel and high rye content contribute to this bourbon on the nose and taste. For me, it’s a two-trick pony: rye spice and barrel notes—that’s all I’m getting. I bought this as a comparator to Eagle Rare’s low rye mash bill, also aged at 10 years. As much as I love the rye notes and how they can balance the sweetness of the corn in this, I actually prefer Eagle Rare. This is not at all a bad bourbon, though, and I would love to try this in a flight compared to their no age statement bourbon and rye."

3.0,"The nose is kind of subdued, but the body is very woody. It's on the dry side and is surprisingly mild, but the wood is definitely there. It's quite spicy with cinnamon standing front and center, but some clove backing it up. It's a bit fruity with some apple standing out. There's some cocoa powder and dark roast coffee in here with some hints of hazelnut and a some smoke. It's a bit tart, but not too much. The vanilla is fairly present and the hazelnut is quite mild. I wish that it were more robust because as it is it tastes kind of like it's taking its old age. I like it better than regular Bulleit, but barely - not as much as I had hoped to (this may say more about the quality of regular Bulleit though). It needs more complexity too. There's an odd hint of tea that is reminiscent of mineral, but tastes better and less out of place. Still, I didn't really want tea in this drink."
