4.5,Wonderful rye from Sanoma County CA. Very rich and enjoyable either on the rocks or in an Old Fashion. There is a companion cast strength as well.
3.5,"Not bad, a bit sweet. Not too hot. Lots of flavor until the very end where it drops off. Still sweet."

3.75,"Spicy but balanced, not overly complex. The nose is maple, caramel, with some fruit and oak. Taste is similar to the nose with rye spiciness. Some fruit and wood. Nice medium body and finish."

3.75,"Aroma: Light all around. Faint cherries and cream. Oak. Touch of cinnamon. And maple. 

Flavor: Tastes of pure maple syrup, but without being notably sweet. A pleasant oaky dryness keeps the sweetness in check. A bit of butterscotch and toffee finds its way from the background over time. Spicy rye keeps the mid-tongue tingling, and the long finish interesting. 

Mouthfeel: Quite dry. Light body. Not too much heat. Drinks very smoothly really for 45%. 

Overall: I’ll admit, I bought this one for the sweet-looking label. That, and the Sonoma designation (was really curious what wine country is doing with whisky). And, of course, the $29 price point pushed me over the edge of any hesitation. Really, for the price, it’s a lovely little rye. What it lacks in character it makes up for in easy drinking (yet still interesting) accessibility. There were a couple other labels from Redwood Empire on the shelf too and I look forward to trying them."
4.5,"Green peppercorn, not too spicy for a rye."
