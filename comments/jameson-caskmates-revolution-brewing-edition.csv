3.25,"On the nose: Vanilla, cream, peppercorn, slight hops

Front: Warm and oily mouthfeel, very little taste

Middle: Butter, spice, olive oil, oak

Finish: White chocolate, salt, peppercorn, slight smoke, notes of hops

Overall: Smooth and easy sipper, not much complexity, evolution only on the backend. Good whisk(e)y for the mouthfeel, but not the most unique whisk(e)y I’ve had. Wouldn’t buy it for myself, but happy to receive it as a gift!"

3.75,What a fun whisky. It takes the ice well and has just enough of the revolution flavor to make it smooth. I don’t really like the revolution beers all that much but this baby is g2g!
