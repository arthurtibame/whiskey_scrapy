4.0,"Nose: Strong but sophisticated smoke (Caol Ila style), then comes rubbery peat. Bit medicinal and fruity. Water adds pepper. Empty glass smells like gunpowder, nice!

Taste: Botanical notes with sweet and heavy peat. Bit fruity as well. Water sweetens and softens the palate even more.

Finish: Dry oak, warming and burning peat lingers well in the aftertaste. Water brings out pepper.

Balance: Nicely balanced vatted malt. Pretty straight forward but good dram."

Extremely well balanced, and goes down wonderfully, slightly briny and a touch salty. If you were to add alcohol to a stream from the Hebrides, let it mature, and taste, this is what you would be left with. This was my first taste of anything from compass box and it was very well worth it. If your into peated whisky this should definetly on your shopping list. Fantastic whisky!"

4.0,I don't know what it is but I do love this stuff.  It's predominantly peat smoke with a core of solid maltiness - and that's pretty much all my taste buds can easily pick out.  There's other flavor lurking in here and maybe that's why I keep coming back for more whenever I'm in the mood for a peated whisky.

4.0,"Edit:  I’d like to take an opportunity to redo my original review based on a recent tasting from 1/1/18.

The Peat Monster is a core offering from Compass Box that tickles that peaty itch one might have.  It’s a NCF’d, no color added blend of Laphroaig, LeDaig, Caol Ila, Ardmore and base CBW whisky (2 year old Clynelish, Teaninich And Dailuaine aged in French oak).

The nose has so much depth to it that it’s amazing.  Juicy orchard fruits, mixed berries along with heavy fire BBQ’d meats.  They left out the salt, seaside qualities that are contained in the blends used and that’s what I think really makes this blend tick.  The aroma is so enticing.  There’s nothing abrasive and the 46% ABV holds it all together quite well.

The palate starts with all those soft, ripe fruits awakening your taste dubs just in time for an oily dose of salted pork and charred oak.  It works so damn well.  The finish is short, but smoky and sweet all the same.  There’s a wonderful oily, mouthwatering finale that just encourages another sip.

In the end, this is another must have bottle.  I wouldn’t say this is an entry level peat whisky, but it’s just very well done.  If you’re one of those people that likes smoky single malts, but doesn’t really want to keep searching over and over for one that hits your mark- try Peat Monster.  It’s sure to check off all the right boxes without any of the hassle.  It can be had for around $60 a bottle, too.  That’s pretty easy on the wallet IMO.  Great job, Mr Glaser.  Another fine blend from CBW.  Cheers.


OLD (LAME) REVIEW:
Pretty damn tasty.  It lives up to its name for sure- lots of smoke and peat, especially on the palate.  Finishes big and smoky.  Very nice.  I will be looking for a full bottle of this one."
3.0,Not as peaty as I expected. Nice smooth body that is rich and flavorful. The peat is good but not overpowering or lingering like Laphroaig.

4.0,Smoky and delicious a big peat hit similar to the laphroig tripple wood.
5.0,"This one is a beautiful surprise.  Had it at my hotel in Montreal.  Very smoky nose but with some delicacy.  The palate is completely surprising compared to what the nose would lead you to expect: sweet and delicate with a very pleasant note of menthol mixed with vanilla.  It is almost like you brace yourself for getting punched in the face and instead you receive a sweet kiss that you were not seeing coming.  Medium and pleasant finish combining good measures of peat, malt, a bit of menthol"
4.0,"The knock against Peat Monster often seems to be that it's not peaty enough. But believe me: it's plenty peaty. Not Laphroaig-levels of phenol, but there's more than enough to go around. And because it's a blend, you get the different kinds of peat flavours mingling together: Smoke, BBQ, tar, vanilla, wet grass, a little caramel, some citrus. Youthful heat, but nice flavour, though you could benefit from rounding it off with some sherried fruitiness."

4.0,I'd already thought about the start of this narrative before I even drank this whisky. Peat Monster..does it live up to its name? I had a feeling no and I was right.  It wasn't the full in your face peat experience its name suggests but despite that I wasn't disappointed. Ledaig 10ish I thought so let's put them head to head.  Interesting..the Ledaig 10 had greater intensity but what I found surprising was I got more complexity and less harshness (prob not that surprisingly as Ledaig isn't the smoothest drop) from the Compass Box and it was newly opened. What it did come down to is what did I prefer. Peat Monster by a head.  It's making me question the 4 rating I gave the Ledaig 10 now
4.0,"This scotch is well done with different layers of smokes. Like camp fire followed with bacons crisps with some sea salt at the end. The smoke is not an explosion but rather a well maintained evolution that last around 15-20 seconds. A lot of depth. The texture is rich and oily. UPDATE: The bottle half empty, it's still a great scotch, but it has lost all its oily-bacon side. A very dry final. Not the same stoch anymore. It's like the oil has evaporated. The final is shorter too. Opened the bottle 1 month ago and stored it in a cool and dark room.  I down rated 1 star"

4.0,"When you're called ""Peat Monster,"" anything less than fulfilling that definition is going to be considered a letdown. And the peatiness is more middle of the road, similar to say a Talisker or Caol Ila. However, while it isn't a smoke bomb, this does have very strong, pleasant iodine and brine components, reminiscent of the mighty Lagavulin 16. There's a malty sweetness and depth I didn't expect. Very enjoyable."

4.0,"Love this...what a clever blend. The nose is a tour of Scotch smokiness, with smoked meat, sooty peat, campfire, and pipe tobacco...but wait, there's more! There's some citrus, salt, and vanilla, too. Palate-wise, we open up with the wood fire, get a little taste of the bacon cooking over the flames, follow it up with a lemon-vanilla custard interlude, and then get smacked with that sooty, gritty peat smoke...and a sweet tobacco after-dinner smoke. Really brilliant blending!"

4.0,"This is a blended malt containing 40% Laphroaig, 20% Ledaig, 13% Caol Ila, 26% Ardmore, and 1% Clynelish, Teaninich, and Dailuaine.  It is bottled at 46% ABV and is not colored or chill-filtered.  The unfortunate name “Peat Monster” will disappoint Islay lovers looking for a peat wallop, and will scare away newcomers looking for an introduction to peat.  Peat Monster would have been better named “Peat Puppy.”  It is young, it is cute, it is unpredictable, it is energetic, and it is ultimately harmless.

NOSE: Ardmore and Ledaig wins over Laphroaig and Caol Ila.  Immediately, this is earthy rather than maritime.  There is grass, soil, and wood chips from the Ledaig; campfire and fruits from Ardmore.  Medicinal notes from Laphroaig are secondary.  Some zesty smoke from Caol Ila are barely detectable.  The nose is complex and vibrant, but delicate. 

PALATE: This is a handshake, not an attack.  The arrival is as light as the “I-stay-well-hydrated-urine” color.  Intensity and complexity builds over a few seconds.  A Speyside fruitiness from the Ardmore, with pears, peaches, and melons, wants to assert itself, but is surrounded by layers of different flavors of peat: heathery, smoky, fishy.  Citrus and a lovely taste of slightly burnt lard imparted with the flavors of a smoking iron skillet develops with repeat sips.

FINISH: I sucked on a few pennies.  I used mint flavored floss, and my gum is bleeding.  I smoked a cigarette.  Copperiness and ashiness.  The younger ingredients can’t hide.  I suspect the younger stuff in this blend is from Islay.  The mainland earthier peat provides tastier, more mature musings: soot-covered dandelions.  Peaches dropped into tar.  Mmmmm…

VERDICT: Delicate.  Complex.  Balanced.  Don’t add water.  I have moved on, but this is a great introduction to peaty whiskies.  This is a Peat Puppy!  Flaming Heart is the “Monster.”  MARK: 85/100."

3.0,"I cannot understate how excited I was for this whisky, being both a great fan of blended malts, peated whisky and Compass Box's unmissable Great King Street range and so in I went, just a short moment after trying Belgian Owl Single Malt.
    The first flavours I get are fruity, sweet with caramel and cocoa. The flavours then drop, leaving a second of silence, only to return with sweet gin, cream, peach, banana and kiwi eventually the peat appears, not maritime, meaty or leathery peat, but a drying, spicy peat. The banana and kiwi return with the flavour of soft French oak for the whisky's finish.
    Yes, I can sense several types of peat and malt competing against each other, but unlike the rich, jazzy Great King Street whiskys offering an exciting waltz of flavours and whiskys, this whisky only offers a palate of weak flavours creating a faint dissonance where none of the flavours quite meet, with the stronger Ledaig and Laphroaig tamed by the Ardmore and the Caol Ila.
  The whisky is as such, much closer in my mind to an Irish whiskey, in a similar vein to Tyrconnell, rather than a full-bodied Scotch, if I hadn't tried Connemara and I was told this was Connemara, I would have been absolutely convinced. If your dream is to find a soft, subtle peated whisky reminiscent of Irish whiskey, this is for you, otherwise I wouldn't recommend this."

Lagavulin 10 is a bridge too far for me (sigh). So it is likely not surprising that PM scratches my itch, hugely. It is phenolic, and gentle. Coastal and peaty, yet sweet and full. Powerful and subtle. It is 46% and NCF, and in Ontario these days (limited quantity, move quickly) it is $64.90! A solid 5 star for me."

4.0,"Nose: Phenols, tar, brine, ash and light wafts of citrus. A really wonderful nose of clear, uncluttered peaty smokiness underpinned by subtle fruit complexity.

Palate: The peat appears first and has a very fresh coastal character - brine, seaweed, smoked herring and driftwood. The peat-reek is complimented and balanced by fruity, nutty and cereal flavours and some really excellent oak. there is never a hint of bitterness, sourness or plasticy peat.

Finish: Long. Smoky, salty and finally sweet and gentle in the aftertaste.

This masterful blended malt is the equal of many smokey single malts, and in all honesty I prefer it to some of the iconic expressions.

John Glaser is a genius blender and this is one of his best creations.  I get why they named it The Peat Monster for marketing reasons but it's actually a misleading name - there is certainly heaps of peat but it's by no means a monster, it's far too elegant.

NOTE: After having a bottle of this open for several months, and now about half-full, I have noticed a slight waxy sour tinge develop on the palate. This expression contains about 13% Caol Ila (of unspecified age) and it's interesting that a tendency towards waxy sourness is something I have noticed with several Caol Ila expressions as they oxidize, so maybe that is the cause here as well? It doesn't spoil the whisky, and is somewhat corrected by adding a dash of water, but it is definitely noticeable.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

3.0,"Compass Box is the hottest blended whisky producer of the moment, but I'm not entirely sure that its basic expressions are consistently better than the usual big players like Johnnie Walker.  Since Compass Box isn't as well-known to the general population, however, it inevitably gets a little boost from enthusiasts looking to show that they know more than regular joes (the whiskey world version of the, ""You haven't heard of them?"" line from music hipsters).  I love some Compass Box expressions, but Peat Monster is only . . . OK.  The nose is full of an herbal, corky, wet-wood style of peat.  The palate, in contrast, is light and sweet.  The finish is a smoky, classic peated finish.  Before looking it up, I would have guessed that this was a blend of young Caol Ila, Ardbeg, and Port Charlotte.  For what it's worth, Compass Box has disclosed that it contains an Islay south shore malt, a peated malt, a peated malt from the Isle of Mull, and a smoky Speyside malt.  Based on that, I'd guess Ardbeg, Caol Ila, Ledaig (the only peated Mull malt), and Benromach.  I'm not sure that the blend of those single malts complement each other, they feel like they're getting in each other's way, if that makes any sense.  At $55-60, it's not badly priced, but at that price I'd just get Ardbeg 10, Caol Ila 12, Ledaig 10, or Benromach 10, and be happier for it.  If I wanted a smoky blend, I'd probably opt for the slightly more boring but easier drinking Johnnie Walker Double Black Label, which also has a lot of Caol Ila in it, and save myself some money to boot. 

PS - Looking at other reviews on this site, including Scotching Hard, I see I was wrong even in my second round of guesses.  Surprised there’s that much Laphroaig in here, I’d think I would recognize my favorite distillery if it made up the plurality of the blend!"

On the taste Peat obviously makes itself known early. Broaching in mossy in terms of the earthy note. The wood is old or used, like wet floorboards.

Looking beyond there's definitely a dry patch on the back that fades to leave the woody notions to linger. Theres some nuttiness behind the tang, a touch of old fruits and ashiness. 


Benefits with a touch of water, no question."

More balanced than I expected given the name The Peat Monster. Natural color of pale straw, non chill filtered and 46%ABV. It certainly has plenty of peat on the nose as you would expect but there is much more.  Bright citrus notes like pomelo or maybe pineapple and ripe apples (I know the last two are not citrus). Smokey, salty and a little sweet on the palate that arrives fast. The finish is peat peat peat but fades quickly. Quite good for a blended malt, better than JW Green in my opinion and at a slightly better price. 4.25 is more accurate"

Very well balanced. The peat wasn’t overwhelming at all and was followed by a nice sweet finish. Very nice. 4.1 Stars.

4.0,"The first time I laid eyes on the cask strength (57.3% ABV) Peat Monster in the 1.75L bottle, I was star struck. The thing looks magnificent. They should have one sitting on a pedestal next to Michelangelo’s David in Florence. I managed to scoff up a few of the 1,985 produced, but have hastened to open one due to the attractiveness and sheer volume of whisky needing consumption. As an alternative, I went out and bought the regular Peat Monster (46% ABV), which I recently finished. I assumed Compass Box used the same formula for both whiskies, but I was wrong. Essentially, the cask strength is 40% Laphroaig, 31% Caol Ila, 20% Ardmore, with the remaining being Ledaig and their Highland Malt Blend. The regular Peat Monster is 54% Caol Ila, 34% Laphroaig, with the remaining being Ardmore, Ledaig, and their Highland Malt blend. The average ages of both blended malts are roughly 8 years. Additionally, the Laphroaig in the CS spent its time in re-charred hogshead versus refill for the regular PM. These variations have probably introduced a different dynamic between the two that @LeeEvolved has pointed out in his reviews of both. The regular Peat Monster is a great dram with a good level of smokiness and complexity, but simply not in the 5-star category as its kindred No Name. The nose is a mild ashy smoke, sea spray, lemon citrus, and slightly sweet vanilla. This all carries through nicely to the palate and finishes respectably with no hint of bitterness. Easily, a 4-star dram. Soon, I hope to crack open one of the big boys to see how it compares"

4.0,"Definitely full of peat as advertised.  My only true comparison was Highland Park 12 Viking Honour, and that was more pretty and floral on both small and taste.  This is more peat forward than that, and has more distinct chemical and rubber flavors.  I enjoyed this well, but imagine it’s not for everyone."

4.5,"Look: Peat Monster is a beautiful straw, light yellow color. Clearly, Compass Box wasn’t worried about the color, and didn’t add caramel coloring. Lacing shows up on the glass when swirling, but it’s minimal compared to most whiskeys I’ve encountered

Nose: wow, the aromas live up to the name.  Peat, hardwood smoked bacon, sweetness coming through as honey. Sea salt is also there, especially after swirling the whisky 

Taste: initial taste is campfire and the ocean.  As a Midwesterner, peat monster brings back good memories of trips to the ocean, and the salty water from the beach.  Very appreciative of this flavor.  Letting the whiskey venture around the tongue, I get more of the sweetness, followed by more peaty, woody notes.  

Finish:  not lacking flavor, the finish is long lasting and largely the peat campfire flavor.  Not terribly bitter or hot, Peat Monster has a great finish.  

Overall: I am a big fan of Peat Monster and would recommend this whisky big time.  Not as aggressive as Laphroaig, but enough peat that you’ll be able to pick apart the earthy notes of Islay."

While this blend is 40% Laphroig according to their website, the other whiskies they’ve blended with the Laphroig have rounded off some of the harsher medicinal notes it’s known for. Overall it reminds me of a slightly less smoky version of the Ardbeg An Oa (another fine peated whisky!). Finish isn’t as long as some Islay offerings, but this isn’t all Islay.

4.5,"info: le célèbre assemblage de Compass Box Peat Monster est un assemblage de fûts de la distillerie Ardomre (un Speyside fumé) et Laphroaig (pas besoin d'introduire cette distillerie je crois). Il s'agit donc un blended Malt puisque issue d'un mélange de single malt de deux distilleries (ou vatted malt si vous préférez).

Récompeses:
- Gold - Liquid Gold Award - 2014 (Jim Murray's Whisky Bible)
- Best Blended Malt Scotch - 2014 (World Whiskies Awards)
- Silver - Blended Malt - 2018 (The Scotch Whisky Masters)
- Silver - Blended Malt - 2017 (international Wine & Spirit Competition)

Nez: sel et tourbe, beurre, vanille, bacon et un vin blanc sec.

Bouche: La sel et la tourbe domine, avec une belle touche sucré sur les pommes et la vanille. Des noix aussi... crémeux... du lait d'amande. Très doux! 

Finale: Fumé longue et salé, du style marin que l'on connait à Laphroaig. Et, au fond de la langue j'ai cette acidité de vin blanc fruité sur la pomme et la vanille. Franchement, belle finale.

Overall: C'est le genre de whisky qui peu faire une belle introduction à la tourbe pour débutant vue sa douceur mais aussi faire l'affaire aux amateurs plus avancé qui cherche la complexité. Surtout pour le prix de 75$ en SAQ, c'est une valeur sûr que vous pouvez acheter les yeux fermés si cette description vous a accroché. Faut pas non plus s'attendre à un whisky à 200$, ce n'est pas le plus complexe et malgré tout on remarque la jeunesse du produit en bouche. Cette jeunesse, cette tourbe et ce sel maritime nous rappelle le style de Ardbeg mais avec une touche de vin blanc. Somme tout, cette texture bien riche et huileuse regorge de saveur. Le taux de 46% est parfait! 92% car je ne me passerais pas de celui-là!"

4.0,"Sometimes it’s almost impossible to think that Compass Box whiskeys are blends. Peat Monster is a perfect example. 

Nose: Sweet Peat and smoke is rounded off by a honey infused green tea aroma. 

Taste: As the title suggests, Peat and smoke dominate. Sweet pure honey dominates the mid pallet with a finish of slight apples and green grapes. The lingering flavor is honey bunches of oats cereal. Sounds crazy but it’s all there. Honey, oats, cinnamon, corn, and sugar. 

Compass box never disappoints. They are the future of blended Scotch. Those who wish to make it the world of Scottish whiskey without actually distilling their own, should consider CB as a pillar of excellence to eventually reach."

Body- Sweet lemon and honey at first taste which quickly develops to a highly brined, medicinal peat.
Finish- To have such a peaty character the finish is medium and the mouthfeel is downright light. 

There is a lot of complexity here. This is a fun scotch. The peatiness turns a more medicinal direction though. I prefer the smoky floral meat of Lagavulin."

The Peat Monster by Compass Box

ABV: 46%
No age statement
Blend see picture 

Appearance: Very light yellow, nearly colorless like champagne. Strong legs.

Nose: 
Right of the bat I get the smell dock of the harbor sea, sweat and hard working dock workers coming through, old leather, pipe tobacco, and smoke fish Opens up in the glass to reveal perfect balance of savory and sweet.

Front: 
Sweet smoke bacon, spicy, warm, and peaty harbor scent is o the taste. Sea salt, nougat, light tobacco smoke, vanilla bean. 

Back/Finish:
Oily and soft mouthfeel. That lingers and continues with sweet fishermen’s pipe smoke finish. Not overpowering in the burn. The peat takes center stage throughout the length of the finish. Notes of charred oak and a bit of ash late.

4.5,"This is a great dram. And i would definitively buy it. Those were my two first impressions, but after a couple of drams i understood that some points should be deducted because of its ""straightforwardness"", and that is why i changed the score from 5.0 to 4.5; still qualifying as a great whisky. 

Bottled at 46%abv, it has the most transparent color ever, white wine color. 

A blend of Laphroaig, ledaig, caol ila, ardmore and another highland malt, this is a very intense whisky.

On the nose is beautiful. It is the best part: Tennis Balls, Nerf Toys (those sticky tennis balls half pink half green), almond M&Ms, Peat that reminds me of Highland Park whiskies, salt, pepper, morning coffee (same aroma as old ballantruan 10yo), Bailey's liquor (almond oil). Spectacular and very interesting aroma.

On the palate is nice. But after 3 sips gets a little boring. Full mouth ashy, peppery sensation. All spice notes.

Even though it is very spicy it is pleasant.

Aftertaste is spicy, bonfire and sulfur notes are there. Very long. Is like your tongue were scorched. Very balanced.

Overall i give this whisky a 94 over 100, and it is a dram to enjoy with food with strong flavors. Not for everyone and not for everyday, still an incredible dram. Cheers!"

3.5,"The Peat Monster truly lives up to its name, but probably not in the terms it was meant to impress, and I should mark it in the beginning, it dwells somewhere far from the Islay peat whiskies. It really is that type of a mighty beast that I would never want to face as it's powerful yet tricky and intelligent but still very young and consequently reckless and gawky.
The aroma is full of heavy peat and smoke, which are combined with rich apple juice. The first nose is very masculine - with notes of fatty well-done steak, grilled onion and burnt wood (and I'm not throwing a barbecue party). Then come some heavy cigar smoke and smoldering ashes - that makes it a perfect match for a silent standing near a bonfire during a heavy rain somewhere in Cascades. In addition, some vanilla appears closely to an end.
The peat and smoke are again dominant in the taste overshadowing all the other nuances. Also some great variety of hot spices here - cloves, cardamom, nutmeg, cayenne pepper. Some minerals, iodine, olives and pickles in the back. Also a few bitter medicinal notes and resin.
The aftertaste is moderately bitter, full of hot spices again, not very salty with wooden tones and notes of fresh grass, neither long nor processive.
In a rough and nasty conclusion, I would say that it was a nice experience but I doubt an idea of trying this exact version of Peat Monster any time soon. It is young, sometimes harsh and lacking depth in many directions but might be really enjoyable under some very certain circumstances in fact."

2.5,"I like peat and Laphroaig is my favourite peated whisky. I like Compass Box whiskies and I was really looking forward to this.  YouTube channel Whisky Mystery liked it a lot and I finally gave this one a go.  

The colour is almost transparent which is kind of neat. 

On the nose I get Caol Ila all day long.  This blend has 54% Caol Ila 8 yo, 34% Laphroaig 7 yo, 6% Ledaig 7 yo, 5% Ardmore 7 yo, 1% Highland blend 9 yo.

I don’t get the Laphroaig but on the palette I get the parts of Ledaig that I don’t like - a bit of an ashy, rubbery peat.  Caol Ila is there as well. 

It is Compass Box smooth and well blended.  The catch is I don’t prefer Caol Ila and I dislike Ledaig. 

What I wanted was more spice, some European oak influence like Spice Tree.  On the finish I don’t get a lot and, the best part of Caol Ila 12 is a smoke that rises on the finish.  That smoke isn’t here and there is no spice.  

Caol Ila 12 is better if you like Caol Ila.  Laphroaig is unidentifiable here and Laphroaig 10 is way better if you like Laphroaig.  Ledaig is identifiable and that’s a bad thing.  I don’t know Ardmore so I can’t comment there.  

Drink it?  Yes, I’ll finish it but it will take a long time.  Buy again?  Never."
4.5,"Laphroaig's medicinal peat roars, which is a pleasure to the nose! Mineral and fleshy, with buckets of ocean and disinfectant, which is needed while you roll in this ""dirty"" whisky, also thanks to the earthiness given by Ledaig. But in this large bonfire, not all peat is the one that burns, as pineapples, candied orange, cloves and brulee creams appear distinctly to complete an oily and full picture. Spectacular, for those who love the genre ça va sans dire.
On the palate the peat becomes more docile while remaining the owner of the field, allowing the other aromas to run around on the lawn with mineral and ashy hints: candied fruit, butter, a touch of licorice, malt biscuit. Light wood in the background. Less dirty than the sense of smell, and perhaps it losts a bit, but always satisfactory.
Long and persistent finish, mineral, of licorice, biscuit, nutmeg and candied fruit, mixed with burnt cigars."

4.0,"It’s called Peat Monster for a reason- has a deliciously mild peaty taste. No strong notes of smoke, but warm spice and vanilla. Mildly sweet and easy to drink"
4.5,"Mildly peated and vanilla on the nose. Nice, strong smokey, peated taste with a rich, oily sweetness. Very easy to drink. Nice, mild aftertaste."
