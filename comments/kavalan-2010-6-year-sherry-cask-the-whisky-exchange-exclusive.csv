3.0,"Reminds me a fair bit of the Balcones Single Malt Rum finish although not as artificial. Needed a fair few drops of water to tone it down. Sweet slightly artificial cherry and sherry. Despite those descriptors not as bad as the BSMR. Better developed, integrated. Vaguely Aberlour Abunadhish but without the true sherry, rich cherry notes 3 star"
