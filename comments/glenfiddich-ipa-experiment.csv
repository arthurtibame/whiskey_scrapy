4.0,"A really bright, nice whisky with a mature development. A drop of water brings out the hoppy bitterness at the finish, but, overall, the IPA influence serves to highlight the characteristics of Glenfiddich's house style."
2.0,"After liking the Jameson Cask Mates finished on stout beer, I was wondering what an IPA might do to a whisky. Sad to say I didn't really enjoy it: the IPA primarily adds acidity from green apples and lemon to the mix, and some hoppy bitterness. Not my cup of tea."
4.0,"Your glenfiddich 12 with a light bitter aftertaste, that really remembers an ipa"
2.0,"Was very excited to buy a bottle when it came out being a fan of both IPA's and whisky, so maybe I built it up too much in my mind.  Didn't do anything for me, wasn't able to determine a difference with an ordinary Glenfiddich 12 ... might need to do again as a side by side tasting"

3.0,"The nose is piney and spicy, and the underlying malt matches that tone with its youth and vigor. I'm not sure I'd pay the price though, given its age and despite its intrigue. From tasting event, 12/17/16."

4.0,"This Whisky completely negates the need for a beer chaser! It gets a bad rap and I resisted it for ages. It's certainly not a desert island whisky but as an aperitif Whisky it's hard to beat. Would probably go well with appetisers, me I just use it to warm the palate or to show Whisky haters that not all whisky tastes or smells the same!"

3.0,"No. 7 on my Glenfiddich tasting journey. As the previous review said, briny sweetness. Like a mild islay in a way. Paired it with an actual IPA beer which was an interesting experience. Really changed the beer flavor. Step down from the Xx. Early 3's I'd give it at $100USD a bottle"
4.0,null
4.0,"At face value, this is an extremely enjoyable dram. You find what you'd expect here: slight brine offset by sweetness and burnt nutty notes. It's just plain pleasant and really nice to kick back with. That's simultaneously gratifying and a bit disappointing. 

With something labeled as the first ever IPA aged scotch, you hope for a little more. Had I not been told this was IPA aged, I wouldn't have been able to tell any difference. It's only by knowing this fact that you're able to pick out the slightest (and I mean, slightest) IPA character elements. On top of that, they're extremely fleeting and you find them only in the very last second of swallowing. If you're not familiar with IPAs, you'll be lucky to find them at all.

If you're in search of a solid scotch, you'll find one here. However, if it's adventure you're looking for, you're better off spending less on a more pronounced wine finish option.

4.0,"Today, IPA. Short disclaimer, I do not like beer, any beer, at all. Never did. Usually only in combination with coke or when I'm already drunk. That was why I was a bit unsure about this dram. Thankfully, it actually works. On the nose I get strong malty notes, a large bitter presence that's probably hoppy in origin, and light brown sugar. Interesting and thanks to the balance between bitter and sweet not offputting. The taste is a bit more complex than the nose. Light honey, sweet malty barley notes, mint and basil as primary herbes, the bitterness of the IPA barrels together with peppered dark chocolate. Quite nice really. This is something I'd drink on days where neither really friendly stuff like Dalwhinnie or ballbusters like Ardbeg both are not the right choice. This is somewhere in between. Rather friendly, but doesn't mind a bit of spanking. Stays with a semi sweet, somewhat cooling aftertaste. Not bad, especially at that pricepoint. On a sidenote, today's my Mom's 63rd birthday. I lift my glass to an awesome lady. Cheers guys."

*Color* Golden, pilsner.
*Nose* Faint hints of wood, surprisingly no IPA or hops.
*Palate* Thin, bit of an alcohol burn.
*Finish* Thin and quick to vanish.
*Notes* Standard Glenfiddich experience with very shallow fruit and nuts. Surprisingly, I don’t feel like the IPA Cask adds very much complexity or depth. I did pick up a lot more with water. Overall, it’s just kind of the same thing and a little pricier than other Glenfiddich expressions. Although it’s a little higher proof, of which you’ll never hear me complain."

3.0,"Nose - Light honey, green apples, citrus peel & pith, pomelo, light caramel.

Taste - Sweet fruity honey & caramel, fruity bitterness, gentle ginger burn, citrusy, citrus pith bitter, light apple juice.

Finish - Lingering citrus pith bitterness, light watery honey/apple juice sweet, quickly fading ginger spice that transitions into a gentle warmth.

Score - 77/100

Final Thoughts - Fairly light & very summery nose. Nice fresh green apple & citrusy notes that I think would be amazing in a highball with a quality soda. Overall this is fairly light with a very ""light colored fruit"" profile that has this overall bitterness throughout which I take to be from the IPA casks. This is an interesting experiment for sure but it's not my thing as I'm not a huge fan of super hoppy beers which are typically IPAs.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

4.0,"On the nose, it is actually quite complex. You get the classic apple juice notes that come with the standard Glenfiddich, but there are more interesting fruit flavors in the forefront that come from the IPA casks. You get some of the hops on the nose as well as some orange flavors. On the palate, there is some bitterness from the hops. BUT, it can be challenging to pick this up if you’re used to bourbon and Distiller Edition Scotches as these have natural wood bitterness. That being being said, however, if you do like bourbon and Distiller Edition Scotches, then you’ll love this because that wood complexity from the IPA casks adds something that is missing in some standard Speyside Single Malts. The fruit and hops from the IPA also shines through which means it’s more exciting that standard apple and honey notes of basic Highland Scotches. This is overall quite unique and a great way to broaden one’s horizons if you’re into different wood expressions of known Scotches."

3.75,Very interesting nose with the honey and bread I get. Finishes more like beer than scotch. The finish lingers but is subdued and mellow. A touch on the spicy side while drinking but good.
3.0,Subtle note of vanilla but left with a sting of alcohol. Not bad for the age but could be cheaper in price.
4.0,"A few drops of water gets this whiskey sitting just right, but it's still soild neat"

3.0,"A very light and fruit forward aroma. Citrus notes up front with pears, apples, and vanilla. Typical Speyside profile on the palate. Honey, lemon, and pears with a white pepper spice. Good texture but a short finish. The IPA hops and  bitterness are subtle, I was expecting more depth to this novelty casking. A good whiskey, but an overpriced whisky . If it was $40 instead of $65 it would be a go to summer dram."
3.5,"Nose: Fresh and flowery over sour apple, luxurious spice creeps forward, beery notes and grain emerge

Palate: Caramel and dusty spice, flowers, fruity acidity emerges, faint chocolate notes

Finish: Dry woodiness freshened with hops, short but refreshing."
4.0,quite pleasant but did not blow me away
2.25,"Nose: Barley at first with green apples and pears and a little caramel. 
Palate: The barley starts on the palate as well. More fruity notes take over and end in a rather short-medium finish of tobacco, leather and a hint of dark chocolate. Unfortunately, over all those things hangs a profound alcoholic sting which makes it not the most pleasant dram. (If you add water you just water down the taste without revealing any new flavours).
In summary: it's an interesting experiment but I don't think that IPA casks are suitable for this whisky. The maturation doesn't bring out the characteristics what I like in an IPA and you just end up with a young, alcoholic dram. (It reminds me of a german wheat beer though, which I like :))"

4.0,"Different. That is the term here. Can you imagine a Whisky that tastes more than less as a beer (craft beer)? Well this dram achieves that goal. 

Bottled at 43%abv, burnished gold.

This one is made by maturing the whisky in Indian Pale Ale casks (a type of a bitter beer).

On the nose: hops? Foam? Carnival foam? Orange definitively, sweet, honey, cake, custard cream. a little spicy. Rare whisky. Interesting.

On the palate is very spicy, clove, but amazingly balanced. Some orange notes, tastes exactly as a craft beer. Finish is pleasant and a little spicy, leaving a mouthfull of allspice. Nice.

Overall i give this interesting dram an 80 over 100, and i do recommend you grab a bottle and give it a try, it is different from everything else. Slainte!"
