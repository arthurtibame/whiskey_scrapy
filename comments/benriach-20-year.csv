3.0,"Резкий. Есть лёгкий приятный полынный привкус, но выделить за спиртуозностью тяжело. Не моё."

3.0,"Light and Rich flavor, not worth the price"
4.0,"Quite strong at first, but with a nice, long-lasting aftertaste. Nice notes of herbs."
4.0,"Did not try but would buy a bottle. Had 10 year old at scotch tasting and liked it. Did not like the 12 or 15 year old. Only buy 10, 17 or 21 if you can find."

4.0,ACTUALLY BENRIACH - 25 YEAR. PLEASE UPDATE APP. REALLY SMOOTH. SUBTLE BURN IN THE MOUTH PROVIDES A KICK TO KEEP YOU HONEST. MAKES YOU SLEEPY.
5.0,Shared by a friend. An old and discontinued version. There must be some part from Sherry Butts. A medium and smooth and comfortable aroma. Better right after a bourbon.

3.0,"Back in ChCh for work and thought it would be rude not to pop into my favourite whiskey bar. It's very dangerous being in here...I came for 1 or 2 and ended up with 5 drams I hadn't tried before. You know when you are visiting a bar to often when they start remembering what you have and haven't tried before! New stuff in all the time...starting with the newly branded 20 year Benriach. 43% but not getting much out it, dropped a couple of drops of water and it fell apart. Haven't been impressed with their standard range to be honest. Came back too it later and it opened up a bit. 3.25 I reckon."

4.0,Vanilla and cream brûlée dominate. Sweet and smooth. Hints of cinnamon on long finish. Lovely slightly sweet Speyside.
4.0,"Tasted neat in a glencairn. Pour is polished brass. Nice sheeting and slow legs. 

The nose is surreal. Super delicate. Ripe orchard fruit is in the front. Damp fields of tall green grass, soft apples that might have gone over ripe, a touch of quince. 

On the tongue this is rich caramel, saltwater Taffy, black pepper and old barrels. Wow! Amontillado? They say PX but it's so delicate. 

No longer available makes me sad. 

Tasting it makes me happy."
4.25,Dark and smooth.  Smokey bittersweet.

3.25,"Nose - Dark honey, hint of chocolate, leather, toasted nuts, dark toffee, oak

Taste - Oaky, spicy fruit, chocolate mole spice/sweet, dark honey, slightly sweet bitter toasted nut skins, baked apples/pears, lightly burnt caramel

Finish - Lingering tingle/heat, sweet bitter dominates, dark caramel creaminess, bitter fruit

Score - 75/100

Final Thoughts - This definitely showed its age in the nose as it was nicely balanced and had this ""dark"" quality that took its time to open up. The palate reflected a tiny bit of this age in that it just tasted ""old"" in that all the flavors seemed well developed, but sadly there was this undertone of this nutty/fruity bitterness that kind of distracted from the overall experience. Some Scotches do this bitterness balance well, this was just a bit distracting.

Would I drink it if offered? - Maybe

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"
