3.75,"The nose: salt water, medicinal peat, faint pair, and on the revisit I get a strong burnt butterscotch

The palete: medicinal peat, briney saltwater

The finish: very short, burnt butterscotch but not sweet

overall it's very apparent this is a very young scotch. Its flavors are thin and it has a bite but it's definitely not boring. For the money this is excellent it will definitely be a staple"

3.5,"Light straw color.
Light peat and heavy pear on the nose.
A little bit harsh and bitter with some light peat-smoke, charred pears and moldy oak for a flavor profile.
A lighter mouthfeel with a bit more of a burn than one would expect for such a low proof.
You can’t beat the price point on this one, but I doubt if I’d ever purchase it again."

Still, better than nothing."

3.75,"Lightly peated. Surprisingly good, considering its bargain price.

Nose: light musty peat, orange? light brine
Palate: a little peat, oily, full mouthfeel.
Finish: spice, lingers"
4.0,"Peat smoke, band aids and cured ham on the nose. Wow! Did not expect it to be this good. The palate is smooth and tasty with a little brine and toffe, finish is medium length and shows the youth a little."
