5.0,"Cask 7502 as in the photo, considering there are also some from la Maison du Whisky and Taiwan. This is one amazing dram with an extraordinary color and has so many sweet, spicy, and bitter tasting notes from nose to palate to finish. The flavors include oranges, figs, plums, chocolate, cinnamon, toffee, cherries, raisins, oak, raspberries, and ginger."
