It’s like a previously friendly Irish pot still developed a vengeful grudge for you.

Gentle with only a little spice
Like a concentrated white wine
Syrupy
Soft peat influence
Toffee

Great value for a very unique whiskey
I like it!"
3.5,"Nose: Lemon juice, herbal cigarettes, brine, peach, apricot, fruity-cereal notes, honey, vanilla and distant wood-fire smoke. A particularly crisp and sweet nose.

Palate: A sweet, light entry with a trace of smoke. Stewed fruits, vanilla, fresh oysters off the rock (!), honey and some mild earthy notes as it develops. A very pleasant light texture - bright but not watery.

Finish: Medium/long. Fruity, sweet and peaty with a lingering sweet smoke aftertaste.

This is one of the more unusual malts I've tasted. It's crisp, light and fruity overall but for a bright profile it's not particularly spirity.  At first I was not impressed, but over time I came to appreciate it. It has many aspects that bring to mind Lagavulin 8 year old - that same citrus/smoke profile and bright but assertive body. The colour is very pale and it reminded me in some ways of some sweet, bright young cask-strength Highland Park expressions I've tasted.

On first taste you could be forgiven for wondering if there is any peat-reek at all. It is certainly there, but it's a sweet and gentle smoke more like mild aromatic pipe tobacco than oily peat, and it's dominated by the citrus fruit notes.  This is absolutely not a peat monster by any stretch of the imagination.

Even though this is called the tourbé (ie ""peaty"") expression, my advice is to forget all about peat when tasting it and approach it without any expectations. In that context it will present as a light, fruity malt at first, but gradually the smoky notes will become noticeable. It's a more than acceptable malt and for the money it's good value.

""Good"" "" 3.5 stars."
