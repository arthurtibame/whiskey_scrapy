3.25,"Honey. Lots of honey. On the nose, palate, and finish. I'm getting very little else. Not very complex, though I'm sure someone with more experience can coax much more out of this. Butterscotch? A bit of citrus? The finish is short and dry, but a faint taste of honey comes back to haunt you. ""Delicately smokey malt""? Well, very delicately so, then, because I'm getting no smoke of any kind from this. I usually add a bit of water even to 40% whisky, but this, at 43%, I prefer neat. Water seems to give the honey nose an unpleasant (to me) baby sick undertone. Time in the glass doesn't seem to do much. (note: four months later, I'm enjoying this more. Not sure if I'm just getting used to the abundance of honey or if the taste has actually changed a bit since I opened the bottle.)"

Bright, lemony herbal flavor, more honey, maybe some stewed peaches, quick finish. This will probably take me more time to appreciate this subtle dram. It's a nuanced pour, but oddly compelling."

3.75,"This highland region Scotch reflects the honey flavor of the region most predominantly. It is smoother than some highland scotches due to its sweetness, but it is still very potent. It does not have a higher score because it’s other notes are more difficult to identify as it is not as adequately balanced. It puts nicely with a fatty fish or chicken."

4.25,This whisky is quite simply delicious. It’s not too challenging and is quite smooth. The candied honeycomb flavors are most prominent but deliver such deliciousness that it makes it worth drinking. I would love to try this in some black tea because it could add some sweetness. It is quite an enchanting whisky and it’s beautiful light fruit and honey flavors means it’s perfect for getting someone into Scotch.

3.5,"Nose: Sweet barley and honey. The slightest bit of salty smoke comes through. The nose is mellow but pleasant. Some peppery oak notes burn the nostrils slightly if I try too hard.
⠀
Taste: At first, this whisky seemed so ""gentle"" that I wasn't getting much out of it. I found it boring and it really needed some time on the tongue to open up. After sufficient time, tasting it sends a sudden mix of mellow sweet barley, earthy bitterness, and ever so slightly smoky notes to coat your palate. The mellow sweetness lingers and the earthy tang turns into a peppery, orangey zest. The pepper lasts well into the finish, but the sweet smoke note is actually what lasts the longest.
⠀
The mouthfeel is somewhat oily but the flavor is more semi-sweetness and earthy bitterness as opposed to the creamy rich sweetness you might expect from the texture.
⠀
I'm really not sure what to think of this whisky. It started out a bit boring and then quickly become a bit more intense than I expected from ""The Gentle Spirit"". I generally prefer either a sweet or a meaty and salty rich scotch, and this doesn't really deliver either of those. This has got some classic highland notes, sort of a more earthy bitter Glenmorangie 10, but I'm not sure how much I like it. I may have to rate this one again after further tastings."

2.5,"Next up in the Whiskies With Names I Can't Pronounce Collection is the Dalwhinnie 15 Year. This Highland single malt Scotch whisky is the second of three samples I received in a tasting box. The first sample didn't scare me away, so on I shall go. I have not increased my Scotch knowledge since the last sample, so this review will be ideal for other Scotch virgins. I'm sampling this as a neat pour.

The nose is very enjoyable. Sweet with aromas of tropical fruits, honey, and mint there is basically no alcohol smell and I am eager to find out if it tastes as good as it smells. The sip is light and dry with a bit of honey sweetness carrying over from the nose, but not a lot of other flavors are present. There is a slight black pepper spice and a hint of smokiness on the way down. The palate is not as good as the nose and a bit of a disappointment. There is virtually no finish to speak of. The drink is smooth and easy to drink, but does not pack a flavor punch and is not likely to be something I would buy a bottle of or even choose as a single drink off a menu. I don't know how typical the Dalwhinnie is compared to Scotch generally, so it's possible that this is just not a remarkable label or it could be that Scotch is not my forte. Either way, I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to try this one."

Gummy salty malt, more tea leaf and spiced wood with a drizzle of raw honey along with the floral aspects from nose. Its along the lines of Aberfeldy 12 only ratcheted up several notches. Finishes with long honeyed malt, sweet spice and salted soft pretzel with delicate dry fading barrel. It is an easy comforting single malt that delivers dense flavors and smoothness that keep you coming back for more..........92/100........Its the Redbreast of scotch, not overwhelming but so damn good with a purity and cleanness to it you have to take notice.

Known as 'the honey malt', Dalwhinnie 15 is a great choice for beginners to set out on their whisky journey. Notes of heather, green pears and barley sugar complement the honeyed aroma. After a sweet, rich and full-bodied arrival, spices build up quickly with a mildly dry and bitter edge, but well-measured. The aftertaste is gentle, citric and wood-driven with hints of cinnamon and apple juice. A characterful Highlander which should not be overlooked!

Yes, this is the ""gentle dram"" being very smooth and only a hint of smoke. But, WOW!!!, what never-ending array of flavor it offers. There is sweet honey and floral lightness, ripened fruits in the depths, a slight hint of chocolate, and an over-all bread-like maltness to tie it all together. The finish lingers forever, and is one of those that cries for another sip. Just nosing this whisky is a wonderful experience. I love ""Kicks"" comment about it being like a whisky rose. So true!

1.75,"Hits you with a sweet and fruity smell of honey and elderflower. No alcohol on the nose. Very light. 

The palate though is very uninspiring. The first thing you get is a mouthful of water. Then you get a little sweetness but also some very unexpected large portion of alcohol which doesn't really fit in anywhere and feels really misplaced.

Not very enjoyable and even though very unique it still is kinda forgettable."

3.25,"Smooth, nice"
3.5,"So as many of you know, a while ago I took suggestions for bottles for a tasting party. This was the bottle that I landed on to represent the Highland region. There was plenty left after the tasting so I decided to review it. This will be a re-review, as I tasted this a little over 2 years ago. 

The stats are the same as before, 15 years old, bottled at 43% ABV, chill filtered and with colorant added making it a yellow gold. Let’s see if it’s the same as I remember it. 

The nose walks the line between delicate and robust, but leans delicate. Honestly it’s not all that dissimilar from some Japanese whiskies. Very floral and malty with plenty of honey. Notes of hay and grasses with some sweeter notes of grapes and lemon. Creamy vanilla and bourbony oak, orange peel and a generous dash of salt. Malty breakfast cereal like Grape-Nuts, red apples, cranberries, raisins and plums. A very light peat that reminds me of a heavily watered down Talisker, and a whiff of smoke. Pickled ginger, menthol and peppermint. Letting it sit in the glass brings more lemon, some apricots and green apples. 

The palate is somewhat sweet and somewhat bitter/tannic. Citrus forward with oranges, lemon and some grapefruit. Very malty, floral and lots of honey. Weak black tea and oak, vanilla and chamomile. A touch of pepper but no spice. Leather, somewhat earthy, a very light peat. A hint of dry sherry, green grape skins and faint blackberries. 

A light bodied mouthfeel that is lightly oily, mouth coating and dry. 
The finish is long with citrus peel, malt, honey, weak tea and dry. 

Well I have to say that based on my previous notes, this stuff hasn’t really changed at all. The only differences I see are the peat notes and that the previous review said I got much more bitter notes. This definitely lives up to its nickname “The Gentle Dram”, and while there is little to complain about, this whisky just didn’t do anything for me. There’s no pop. Rather boring, which is fine for when you want something just to mindlessly sip, but not something to come back to when you want to really enjoy a dram. I also want to point out that the price for this is way too high. $85 for a 750ml bottle is outrageous. Luckily I was able to snag a 1L bottle at duty free for only $64. That price is a little more palatable. Last time I gave a 3.75, this time I think a 3.5 is fair. 
Cheers 

And BTW, the tasting party was a big hit and you can see some picture and my tips for hosting your own party in the latest episode of Dapper Drams on YouTube.

3.75,"A sweet and full dram that hits the spot with light peat, vanilla, nuts, and salt. Not exceedingly complex but full and long lingering with a delicious taste. 

Nose: simple vanilla and nuts. Surprisingly no trace of peat
Palate: nuts and salt first then vanilla and followed by a very pleasant peat and spice.
Finish: slow and nice just like the Jazz I listened to while drinking.

3.75,"The first time tasting this was rich smooth honey however upon buying a bottle really let’s you get to know a whisky. Once familiar,  smoke is first on the nose, specifically leather that couples well with vegetal tequila notes rounded out with honey and malt.  The pallet adds chocolate with time, while always having a decent bitter mint ruff ness. A fine dram for people that want to be acquainted with easily pleated whisky."

4.0,"Gentle, heather honey notes lead to a delicately rounded mouthfeel.  Very friendly and nice, but not as subdued as an Irish whiskey.  At $70-$80 USD, it's a tad pricey. But if you want to make an impression on a beginner scotch drinker, this is a great pick.

Bottled at 43%abv.

Everything is balanced here. On the nose, honey, plums, fresh peanuts, perfume.

On the palate: honey, salt, caramel and tobacco. Aftertaste is medium with ginger spice.

Super easy drinkable, very enjoyable, nothing to die for but an excelent dram, 80 over 100."

4.25,"nose: honey, sweetness, very fruity, fresh fruitiness of apple, pear, apricot, light with an almost bright crispness quality, hint of spice but in the background, very aromatic but gentle and very pleasant, barely any smokiness. Flavor: light sweetness of honey, fruitiness with a heather note, very gentle from beginning to end, lingers and last nicely (long aftertaste), a light oak spiciness, faint vanilla note, very light hint of smoke (roll on the front side of your tongue for 5-10 seconds and swallow keeping from the backside; the light smoke will follow on the finish a few seconds later), very full experience from beginning to end, extremely friendly throughout, unbelievably smooth. Water does not change the profile much but does bring all aroma and flavor profiles down equally, less quality experience. Recommend no water."
