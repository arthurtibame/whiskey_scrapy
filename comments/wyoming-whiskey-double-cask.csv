4.0,"Really enjoyed this. Fruity notes on the nose are  also prevalence on taste as Sherry influence is obvious. Almost too sweet, but then it balances out really nicely to a long smooth finish. Would recommend as a sort of dessert whiskey."

3.0,"I hate using the term ""smooth"" becasue that typically means boring for me but this has enough complexity in the sweetness and easy sipping ability for a great evening."
3.0,"For a low cost, no age whisky it's a 4 star.   If you are used to 10-21 year whisky as comparison,3 star.  solid but young."

5.0,"Wyoming Whiskey is absolutely my favorite go to bourbon. It’s an easy drinking, everyday soldier but still robust enough with nice sweetness, black tea, herbaceousness, vanilla, caramel and spices. The barrel char notes are clean and superb with the slightest bitterness rounding out the profile. So very smooth! This Double Cask, 100 proof version is just on another level of pure splendor. It’s not only more of everything but fantastically fruity, a touch more sweet and surprisingly even smoother than the std 88 proof version. The sherry finish shines through and adds a ton of depth but isn’t for every whiskey drinker. I tend to love sherry finished whiskey and this is my favorite... by far! First bottle I bought was $55 and now the price has climbed to $62 because of the growing scarcity. This is one of those whiskeys that you sip and you sip and you sip some more, with good friends or by your lonesome self. It doesn’t matter..,it’s just f’n delicious."
4.25,"This is a master’s thesis in barrel finishing. The sherry is perfectly integrated with the bourbon and neither is more dominant than the other. Beautifully rounded and a gorgeous dram. 
Nose: caramel, vanilla, mallow root, brown sugar, black tea, fig, raisins. 
Palate: brown sugar, vanilla cream, blueberries, dark fruit, black tea, clove, barrel spice, leather, almonds."

4.0,"I picked this up based upon the app saying it is similar to Nikka Coffey Grain.  The app is correct, if you enjoy Nikka you'll dig this stuff. With the proof was expecting a  more bozzy nose and mouth, it's not, super smooth, has nice profile. Glencairn glass"
4.0,great tasting smooth whiskey. My son and I both enjoy this great bourbon

5.0,"Appearance:  Rich amber, thicker, clings nicely to glass.

Nose:  Brown sugar, carmel, and vanilla.  Sweet and fuller body

Palate:  Brown sugar and a bit of molasses out front give way to caramel oak, and a bit of spice.  Excellent mouth feel.  Wonderful neat.  Needs no water or ice.

Finish:  Smooth with pleasant burn lingering on the tongue.  The caramel and vanilla are true throughout and then gives way to brown sugar and spice.

Super dessert bourbon!"

4.5,Dessert bourbon! Almost like a bourbon candy wrapped in a sherry shell. Has some nice spice to it as well. Creamy mouthfeel and medium length finish.
5.0,"I was able to find a few bottles for $44 and decided to purchase one to see if it lives up to the reviews. After the first bottle, I eventually purchased three more. I'm happy that the people in my area have no knowledge of the Double Cask. It's that dang good"

4.5,"This limited-edition double cask offering from Wyoming Whiskey brings my tally of U.S. state whiskies up to 4. It utilizes a cask combination that’s common in Scotch (substitute virgin oak for ex-bourbon here) but relatively unusual in the world of bourbon. And it’s a wheater to boot. The only other thing I can really compare to this to is Legent from Jim Beam, and even that is significantly different, even just on paper. At any rate, I expect this one to stand out for multiple reasons. Let’s find out.

Nose: Cherry, brown sugar, wintergreen, cinnamon, and heavy oak right out of the gate. The sherry cask is evident, with grape jelly, raisin, fig, and cranberry popping out of the glass. A bit of leather. It’s bitter as it is sweet. Caramel and cola round this one out. Some barrel char as well. This has developed quite nicely as the bottle has sat open for a couple months. The Distiller notes are quite accurate here.

Palate: Cherry, brown sugar, vanilla, caramel present standard bourbon notes. However, like on the nose, the palate has a heavy sherry-influence. Jelly, raisin, fig, and date hit hard in the next wave of flavor. It’s leathery, syrupy, and tart. Cranberry, goji berry, almond, and flax seed make this one reminiscent of trail mix. Orange peel and barrel char add bitterness and smoke. Sweet but dry red fruit, and cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove provide major spice. Many layers, much to love.

Finish: Oak, leather, orange peel, brown sugar, and caramel transition into baking spices such as cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg. It’s a medium-length finish that reflects some of the prominent aspects of the nose and palate.

Good whiskey that has become great with time. WW made a great choice with this one. The unique combination of sherry casks, a wheated mash bill, and whatever the Wyoming climate brings to the table make this respectably proofed whiskey a standout. 4.5, VFM considered. It ran me $50, and I’d happily spend $50 in the future.

Since buying this one, I’ve added a High West bottle, bringing the total to 5. 10% of the way there… I’ll likely add a couple more bottles from WW before I even come close to hitting 50 states. This one tends to rate higher than the others made by WW, so it could be an outlier. But after trying this one, I’ve got an open mind. Buy it if you see it. Here’s to a damn fine effort from Wyoming."

5.0,"1 of the 10 drammers club pours. This is in a league with many PX cask single malts with notes of vanilla, caramel corn, floral, berries, chocolate, toffee, chocolate, and cinnamon."
