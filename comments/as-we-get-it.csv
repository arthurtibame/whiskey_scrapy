5.0,"I got to taste it at the World of Whisky in Edinburg, but when I asked to buy a bottle, to my dismay, they were out of stock. I looked EVERYWHERE for this stuff.  3 difference cities, I popped into every liquor store I saw in search of this bottle, and EVERYONE was either sold out or had never even heard of it. Finally, on my last day in Scotland, off the beaten path, in a non-descript store, on a dusty shelf, I found a dusty bottle, and I literally RAN to it, grabbed it, and brought it up to the cashier. Didn't look at the price. Didn't care. To this day, I have no idea what I paid for it. All I know is it's one of my prized possessions.  
So uh... yeah, it's pretty good!"
