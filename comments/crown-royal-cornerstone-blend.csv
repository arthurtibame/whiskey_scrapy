3.0,"Some fruit and spice on the nose, but the prevalent note is dill. Same on the palate. Smooth, some sweetness, and pleasant bitterness at the end. 7/29/17"

4.0,"Nose shows a lot of wood and spice, with just a bit of heat and a hint of vanilla.  After a few minutes in the glass it takes on just the very slightest bit of mint.  On the palate, it's fairly rich and creamy, but surprisingly hot for the ABV.  My notes are almost a carbon-copy of Jake's pro review; Spice (nutmeg, clove, anisette, cinnamon) followed by brown sugar and vanilla, then just the faintest hint of dark cherries.  Wood is present from beginning to end, but it's more of a background that ties things together rather than its own distinct flavor experience.  Finish is medium, with a bit of heat giving way to caramel and vanilla before leaving a clean, just swished with Listerine feeling, that lingers for a minute or two.  I liked my first bottle of CR Hand Selected better than I like this, but it's close.  I prefer this to my second bottle of Hand Selected, and I'd imagine with it being a blend that it will be far more consistent than an individual barrel bottling.  Whether that guaranteed flavor profile is enough to sway you from the potential for an incredible experience is completely up to you.  As for  me, I'm going to find more batches of Hand Selected.  And when I find another winner that matches my first, I'm going to buy a case."

4.0,"My grandfather is a whiskey man, he would have a ""tot"" every night before bed, and still does, at 93! Now his brand was Imperial (shudder), but every time I visit I bring him a bottle of something proper, he's earned it. But his real poison of choice was a stiff Manhattan, I've many a fond childhood memory of nipping his boozy cherry from an empty glass... Nosing this Crown Royal brought those memories flooding back. In fact the nose is reminiscent of his basement home bar! Old dusty oak, woodsy spices and a sticky jar of maraschino cherries. It's powerful and a touch hot, almost menthol-like at the back of your nose, calling you to attention. However, it's surprisingly smooth and amiable on the palate with rich spices and sweet grainy vanilla, transitioning through a playful seam of horseradish into the warming finish. Graciously shared by the preeminent Pranay, my first Canadian and my first rye influenced whiskey... Oh how our little worlds expand!"

5.0,"Watching Game of Thrones and...I think I found my go-to under-appreciated  but high quality whiskey!  This is my second Crown Royal.  The first was the so-called best whiskey by that Panama hat wearing Jim Murray.   I really enjoyed that one (Northern Harvest rye)  namely for the surprise it gave me---I thought it would be horrible and it turned out really good.  This one is better.  By far.   Nose is caramel and chocolate.  But the taste is of rye backbone.  Mint chocolate and caramel.  Really enjoying this.  Finish is long and smooth.  For $55, you really can't do much better.   Highly recommended, especially considering the value for money!!"

4.0,"Sweet and smooth. A bit of spice mid palate, ending fruity and vanilla. A broad-appeal, well-balanced whiskey that could bring in people who are intimidated."
