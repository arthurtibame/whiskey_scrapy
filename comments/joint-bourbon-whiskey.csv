3.25,"I have never heard of it before this day. I found it on a VIP airport lounge in Turkey, and i ask for a dram. I believe it is pretty cheap, and it seems is popular in Poland and Turkey.

Bottled at 40%abv, tawny colored.

On the nose is too dim. And it is more a prune/herbal/grapy bourbon rather than a Vanilla/banana bourbon. Notes of prunes, dry brown grass, tobbacco leaf and a little ashy/coal notes (like in Jack Daniel's).

On the palate is amazingly boring. Caramel, bitter prunes, herbal notes. Too simple; too easy dribkable. This is one you buy when you are young and want to get drunk for a low price.

Finish is spicy; mostly ginger. Medium long.

Overall i gave it a 60 over 100, and then i added water. Water improved it a lot, revealing the vanilla/banana notes on the nose and vanilla sweetness and brown sugar notes on the palate. This might raise the score to reach a 64 over 100, but still a 3.0.

Drink it only under my same circumstances: if it is free."
