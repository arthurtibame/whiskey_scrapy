4.5,"Taste:  2 oz. neat in glen cairn glass, then 3 drops of water.

Nose (4.75):  Luscious and fragrant.  Crispy green apples, caramel, and brown sugar.  The nose is Fall like and inviting.

Palate (4.5):  Buttered rye bread, browned butter, apple, and nutmeg.  Spice comes in on the back end.  The feel is creamy and coating.  This is a rich, tasty rye.  Water detracts in my opinion and brings about some bitter notes.

Finish (4.75):  Nutmeg, cinnamon stick, apple pie spices.  Long and lingering.  Finishes with that buttered rye bread note.

Overall:  I am not a huge fan of the regular straight rye.  I find it just ok as my main complaint is that it is a bit thin and kind of singular.  This one is totally different.  It is rich, lush, buttery, and the nose immediately reminded me of being in an apple orchard at harvest.  There were so many good flavors that just seemed to play well with each other and pop.  A little background here-  this is likely NOT MGP but from Alberta Canada and definately bottled in Vermont.  Among all the fancy labels on the bottle there is suspiciously no mention of ""distilled in/by"" anywhere on the bottle.  Don't let that in any way dissuade you.  If this is what quality single barrel, cask strength rye from our neighbors to the north tastes like, then count me in!"
