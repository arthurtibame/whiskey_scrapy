4.0,"NOSE: Honey, sandalwood, kettle corn, very faint acetone note, faint stone fruit, bananas foster, not overly complex nose, veering very much to the sweet side. PALATE: classic vanilla, corn pops, mild cinnamon tones but subtle, not terrifically oily but has a decently coating mouthfeel,  at the same time there is some astringency and a good bit of lemon or citrus flavor. FINISH: Minimal burn, cornbread, white chocolate, fairly long finish. THOUGHTS: Enjoyed this. Reminds me of EH Taylor single barrel at a better price point (which given where they both come from probably makes sense). There's not anything really unexpected here, but it's got the right notes of that classic bourbon profile. I personally would prefer some more cinammon and rye spice in my bourbon, but I would buy this again."

4.0,"Nose is light vanilla, hay, and faint citrus. Flavor profile continues the hay and citrus then the fruit comes in big. Apple and black cherry with some pineapple. Finish is very robust in comparison. The big rye shows up with hot cinnamon and licorice building a strong long finish. 
Nice drink with multiple flavors hiding below the obvious."

Strong herbal notes and some bitterness on the front end, the spices remain throughout. A hint of vanilla and cough medicine at the end. Definitely out of the ordinary, but in a way that's probably not for me. I'll revisit it later. 4/13/17"

3.5,"Woody and extremely dry. Maybe one of the driest bourbons I’ve tasted. On the nose I get oaky rickhouse with a bit of red cherry, but not maraschino or overly sweet cherry. Reminiscent of cherry cough syrup maybe? Robitussin aged in oak? 

Spicy on the palette with some dried orange and oak. Barely a trace of sweetness. Tiny bit of allspice.

Not much of a finish but it doesn’t vanish either. 

This is my first experience with any of Barton’s whiskey. NH recently got a supply of the 1792 Full Proof which I’ve heard good things about so I’d love to give that a try soon. In the meantime I will enjoy this one for how different it is from my other bourbons. Cheers!"

Overall it's sweeter and smoother than the small batch..The rough edges seem sanded down a bit.. It is delicious, maybe a little more mature, but it loses that 'Barton Bite' ..for better or worse.  A 50% premium over the small batch places it right in the middle of some tough competition"

4.0,"Nose: small batch 1792 has a bit more sweet and dark fruits on the nose but this starts out with leather and rye. Not a super spicy nose but the earthy rye is definitely there. Hints of tea, honey and corn. That’s a predictor of things to come. 

Palate: the rye nose gives way to a balanced, rich, brown sugar sweet with hints of cinnamon and butterscotch. More honeyed flavors here too. 

Finish: the rye comes back here with spicy warmth.  Vanilla and nutmeg. Is quite a complex journey from start to finish for this bourbon. 

This is a different experience than the small batch I’ve had. It’s different in a unique and pleasant way."

4.0,"Bottled: 2018
Age: unknown 
Proof: 98.6

Nose: a perfect balance of corn, oak and leather, hints of butterscotch, subtle earthy tones from the high rye mashbill 

Palate: quite spicy, with dark fruits and vanilla, mid palate peppers

Finish: this bourbon starts sweet and punchy, then spice on the mid palate and after peaking finishes with a bit softer flourishes, hints of toffee and more vanilla, baking spices

This is the best 1792 has to offer based on what I’ve tried. If a bourbon can crescendo, to borrow a music term, this one delivers. It’s excellent. Because it’s a single barrel, your mileage may vary."
3.5,"I am reviewing a Store Pick. Barrel #227 picked by Sun Devil Liqours in Mesa, AZ. 
This is the last of the 1792 Limited Expressions that I have yet to taste or purchase. The main reason being that I always see it for the same price as the Full Proof (both typically $39.99) and with big difference in proof, I always pulled the trigger on the Full Proof and passed on this one. That was until the good folks at Sun Devil Liqours decided to drop the price of this one to $29.99! With a 30% discount and their solid track record of picking great barrels, I decided to pull the trigger. 
So what makes this different to the other 1792 offerings? Well pretty much like every other Bourbon Distillery, they claim they hold back ""exceptional"" barrels to be designated for single barrel bottling. This one was then personally selected by Sun Devil Liqours (they receive 5 samples from Barton and of those they decide which they would like to purchase). I always seek these out over the standard offering as they tend to be better in my experience regardless of the type of Whiskey (especially when I have positive previous experiences). It's bottled at an interesting proof point of 98.6 proof (possibly to delineate it from the BiB which is the same mashbill but bottled at 100 proof). Like all other 1792 offerings it is chill filtered. They don't disclose the exact mashbill but we do know it's a high rye mashbill. On to the tasting:
Upon entry is soft and a little buttery, with toffee, vanilla and brown sugar being the predominant notes that lead to pepper and clove spice on the mid pallette. So far it's a pretty standard, non discript Bourbon. That however changes on the long finish that starts with a big oak swell followed by ripe red cherries and a hint of cocoa that is slightly drying. It's as great as it was unexpected. It transforms this from a ""meh"" bottle to an above average one! 
This still isn't as good as the Full Proof Store pick they have which is outstanding, but it's extremely solid especially for the $29.99 price point. 
Now, I would definitely recommend before buying this one, seek a sample from the store or buy from one that you trust their selections. The standard version of this I have heard less than stellar feedback on it. 
Overall, I have to say Barton does a really great job putting out affordable, quality product that is well priced. They make a great everyday dram. 
Cheers all!"

4.25,"I was mildly disappointed with the 1792 Small Batch, so I picked this up a week after that purchase based on a conversation with an ABC employee. I definitely agree with his assessment, this is a great single barrel bourbon in this price range. For reference, the Small Batch is $30 in NC and the Single Barrel is $40. There are not many bourbons in my state that have generic and single barrel at affordable prices. The ones that pop in my mind are Evan Williams, Knob Creek, Four Roses, Jim Beam, and Bowman Brothers. I have not had the Knob Creek or Bowman Brothers Single Barrels, but so far the difference between the 1792 offerings has been the most drastic. I would say that the Elijah Craig Single Barrel Select was even more pronounced, but that was a store pick.

I thought the Small Batch was hot on the taste, with mild notes of banana, oak, and caramel. The Single Barrel, with a slightly higher abv, is so much fruitier on nose and taste. This is like a boozy banana dessert, maybe bananas foster or fried cinnamon bananas you'll get at some Mexican and Brazilian restaurants. I tolerate bananas, I don't seek them out. But man does this flavor pair well with spicy caramel oak flavors in whiskey. Unfortunately the bottle provides ZERO information on the barrel, but it's affordable and worth picking up."
4.0,"The quest to enjoy barrel proof products continues as another worthy contender steps up:

Nose: lite sweet caramel and toffee, sweet pineapple and hints of mango with rich butterscotch, entirely appealing, if slightly unusual. 

Front: A load of butterscotch lemon,  rich toffee and tobacco bitters help balance the sweetness and some of that legendary barton barn door oak peeks through near the end.   At the top some caramels, brown sugar starches and fruit notes can be detected  along with some black peppery heat and clove and kitchen spices.  

Finish: a bit rough as the richness tapers into some nutty wood after taste, nothing too harsh or unpleasant, just nothing like the smooth sweet start to this proofy liquid and  the hearty middle bite it offers.   Considerably less heat at the end than might be expected.

Having a chance pickup of the 1792 Single Barrel  on the cheap and given it is a single barrel and Bartons upper level product, I couldn't pass this one up and now I'm glad I didn't. 

Bottled at 98.x proof there is a good bit of flavor packed into this Bardstown offering and while some of the 1792 bottles are less than remarkable, the barrel strength is enjoyable if not quite on the high level as some of the BT and SunBeam barrel proof products.  Worth picking up below 50-55ish  or as a bar whistle wetter. 

Broke out an Archetype Axis Mundi for this sampling, the Axis is an amazingly smooth stick."

3.5,"So a few thoughts before we get into this.  I've had a few store picks of this, this is however the official single barrel.  I like it more than the picks.  I also live in southern ohio and shop in kentucky....I had to order this online and have a bottle of kentucky bourbon shipped BACK to kentucky almost....explain that?  lol.  

Nose - Cherry wood.  Oh man, this is my nose on a bourbon.  The oak gives off that sherry and yet it is super sweet.  Vanillas and caramel are so intense and fruity.  There's a bit of old store oak and leather.  It's not super old whisky so it's not insanely complex but it has all those notes you get in complex bourbon just in a more 40 dollar form.  

Taste - waxy, old books, leather, cherry medicinal notes, oak, and of course vanilla and caramel.  This is both simple and complex in such a wonderful way.  There's so much going on but yet you could take it all in as if it is just a basic bourbon.  That's so unique.  

Finish is pretty minimal.  Just a standard bourbon here.  

I absolutely love how drinkable this is.  I love the sweet profile.  I love the fruity notes without the oak bite.  This is my favorite bourbon without a heavy oak note.  I might even like this one over the full proof which is crazy to say.  That said, we're still talking younger bourbon.  It's not super special so 3.5 is a crazy high score.  I feel I'm just too biased in my fandom of this brand.  I only regret I've not had any of their finished stuff."

3.5,"This was a private barrel from Olde Crabapple bottle shop.  My first thought when trying this bourbon was that it was lighter in color.   After a google search I found out that this is aged in a char 3 barrel where the majority of bourbons I drink are char 4.   Something else for me to learn about :).  This is a very good smelling bourbon with a fruity, floral smell.   Smooth, vanilla notes with just a slight burn.  Not as much body or syrupy feel as I’d prefer.   Good for the price.   Would like to try this with some more aging."

3.75,"I liked this one better, much better, my second time through. Mellow and smooth, but with a good spicy finish. Vanilla. Toffee/caramel, but fruity/floral notes brighten it up. Altogether a well rounded bourbon that pleasantly surprised me. I’ll keep it in stock."

4.0,Binny’s Beverage Depot pick. Excellent bottle. Thick wood and char with a great corn background. Not as spicy as most 1792. Very much like double-oaked offerings.
3.75,"*As with any new bottle I will come back to this one in a month or less for a second review. 

1792 has grown on me after coming to appreciate Very Old Barton Bonded, which is one of the best bonded value bourbons on the shelf. The small batch 1792 is nothing special and VOB beats it hands down for me. This single barrel shines though. 

Proof: 98.6
Vintage: unknown

Nose: some rye earthiness, but sweet fruits, leather, hints of honey and brown sugar 

Palate: quite rich, a little oily and more complex than the small batch offering. Sweeter than I expected from this higher eye bourbon. Balanced baking spices with butterscotch. 

Finish: medium warmth, dry finish but not as dry as other high rye bourbons I have tasted. 

A very balanced bourbon, from the earthy nose to the sweet candy palate to the spicy and dry finish. This single barrel has a lot to offer. Excited to return to it soon."

2.5,"If you buy this, drink it in the first 48 hours. Only then will it be worth it.

This went from great to bad faster than the 1792 Full Proof. Like the Full Proof, on opening it was a delight. Less carmel & cinnamon than the Full Proof was on opening, but still so sweet you couldn't imagine it was over 30% alcohol. It didn't make it 4 days before becoming cinnamon hell. No amount of ice could tame that beast. I tried a 50/50 mix with some Johnnie Black, which tamed it for 3 more days. On the 4th it turned into what can only be described as a Fireball on steroids with a hint of Johnnie Black. 

Again, if you buy this, drink it before the end of day 2."

3.5,"Asheboro, NC ABC Store Pick

The nose is very sharp with alcohol.  It is not isopropyl but not acetone either.  The fruit aroma finally cuts through.  Think very good apple brandy.

The flavor is very fruity with citrus and apples without the benefit of the baking spices I love.  
There is no real floral presence and not a lot of vanilla.  The flavor that is there is a winner.  It sips very smooth and is very complex.

The finish is a medium long smooth fade out.  

I had difficulty getting the alcohol aroma to fade. A splash of water helps out with all the flavors.  One rock changed a bit of the dimension but not in a negative way.  I think this dram stands stronger by itself.  When it is tasted along with other pours, the flavors seem a bit muted.  While I was on a recent vacation, I hosted a blind tasting of 5 single barrel bourbons.  This bottle finished 4th.  It didn't have really negative responses, it simply couldn't stand with Four Roses SB, Jim Beam SB, or Evan Williams SB.  If there was a way to supress the alcohol overtones, I believe the more subtle notes could shine through.  This is a nice change of pace from a distillery with different flavor profiles than my normal go-to drinks.  Find it on sale and pick up a bottle.  It's a big step up from their regular small batch."

4.0,"Store pick from Sun Devil Liquors in Mesa, Arizona

The nose is medium strength with banana, butterscotch, and pear leading the way. Waaayyy down in there is a whiff of cedar. Enjoyable. 

Palate opens with the butterscotch and banana from the nose, with the addition of cake frosting and a good amount of caramel. Some clove creeps in there as it heads to the spice laden finish, which is on the long side of medium with big pop of ginger ale, clove, and cinnamon. Drinks right at it's proof point, which feels right for the flavors. Medium body, but very oily (a good thing).

I really enjoyed this; the aromas and flavor profile don't stray to far from what you'd expect from 1792 but this is probably the most balanced of the line that I have had, which may owe to it's store pick status. Sun Devil definitely picked a good one, no doubt about that. At $30, it's an absolute STEAL, and I will be going back for more."

4.0,"Nose bubblegum sweetness, honey, light fruit like a really sweet apple almost canned peaches, tropical fruit resembling pineapple and quick bit of lemon. Slight but not overwhelming alcohol smell. Hidden in the back is a buttery caramel corn note. Almost like someone added browned butter to regular caramel corn. Palate is the same bubblegum sweetness, quick hint of banana, and the fruit note strong pepper, rye spice and cherry note mid palate, more rye spice ramps up almost giving a cinnamon note and wood tannin on the end. Finish is rather short the only notes that are left in the finish are honey sweetness, barrel char and apple with the skin so it's got that touch of sour/bitterness that you get from eating apple skin.  I enjoy these incorporate a bit of everything well into one whiskey kind of drams. Then again I like challenging and smokey bourbons and scotches."
4.0,"Tropical fruits on the nose, like pineapple and papaya. Grassy, herbal, some oak spice and caramel.
Palate shows the pineapple and grassy qualities of the nose, while adding in quite a bit more sweetness with toasted coconut, creme brulee, and butterscotch, but spices start sneaking in before the sweetness takes over. Annise, cinnamon, and white pepper show its head in the higher rye mash. 
Smooth but not too rich and finish is somewhat abrupt but still pleasant as it lingers."

3.5,"Compared favorably with Evan Williams and Jim Beam, but not with Eagle Rare. It's not at the level of Booker's either, not even at the level of Kitchen Table. It's good, but it could really use some improvement.
It has a surprising sweetness and a lot of spice. There is clear butterscotch and some light brown sugar for additional sweetness, though it mixes with rye spice and leaves the flavor a bit light and open like Evan Williams, particularly on the finish. There is mild dried cherry in the spice along with plenty of vanilla and a substantive floral element. There's a lot of general fruit flavor, but it has a bunch of subtle elements in there rather than just being a mess of generic fruitiness like in a juice box. The barrel is clearly perceptible, though it doesn't have that deep richness that I often enjoy. Still. There is a fair richness in the middle that comes across as decently hedonistic and the flavors are mostly good. Weirdly, this bottle doesn't indicate which single barrel it is from. It's lighter than I would like, but it's certainly passable. Sure it's on the sweet side with a big spicy hit, but I enjoy it. Some leather is there, though it is far from the richness of Joseph Magnus. Still, this is quite a good bourbon. It isn't super complex, but the flavors are mostly quite good and there is more complexity than there initially appears to be. As far as the spices go, cinnamon and allspice are clearly there and the heat could not be explained without some black pepper. This is really surprisingly good"
