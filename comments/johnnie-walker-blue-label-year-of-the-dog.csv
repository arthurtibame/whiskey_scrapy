5.0,"This is very different from the normal blue label. This one is bottled at 46% abv instead of the normal 40%. It is sweeter on the palate, has more depth and flavor, and just as smooth as the normal blue label. The normal blue label tastes “watery” compare to this year of the dog edition. I highly recommend this whiskey, it’s truly a unique and worthy dram, and the beautiful artwork on it is a plus!"
