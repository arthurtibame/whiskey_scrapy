4.25,A private selection to the bar.  Nice and smooth up front with a bite on the back end.  Seems to have a bit of a sweet taste to it.
4.25,"Store pick: Bottles 7
Nose: brown sugar, leather, tobacco, butterscotch, toffee, flat cola, very little ethanol 
Palate: thin, sweet, more vanilla than nose, brown sugar, on the backend the sweetness gives way to oak and spice
Finish: medium, more heat than expected from nose, oaky, barrel spice and pepper"

2.75,"A sample as part of the ""Whiskey Transfer Program"" from dthom.  Full disclosure: my first taste of a Four Roses item other than the standard yellow label stuff which I wouldn't use to degrease an engine.  A barrel pick from Binny's in Illinois bottled at 60.2%.  I don't hate it but wanted to love it as dthom thinks it is excellent.

Nose: Heavy ethanol punch, light lemon peel, white sugars, musty wood, and a hint of olive brine.

Taste: Sweet and surprisingly oily and thick.  Wood heavy on the front which I found surprising.  More citrus peel and a little more olive brine on the flavor.

Finish: Medium-long with quite a bit of rye spice and a little more olive.  I'm getting a lot of olive brine all the way through this whiskey.  Weird.

Not a bad whiskey but a little one dimensional and too much rye spice for me on the finish.  Maybe I just don't like Four Roses?  The olive flavors were a little off putting for me."
4.5,"Single barrel, 106.4 proof.

Palette is full of cinnamon apple and cherry flavors with a lingering bubblegum aftertaste. Deliciously fruit forward, one of my favorite 4R recipes.

The finish carries with the oily bubblegum but short lived."

4.0,"Aroma - Earthy, Fresh and Floral. Smells like Rose petals

Taste - Bright Fruits; Green apple and apricot up front. Tapers into a Carmel bomb with a classic backbone

Texture - light and incredibly smooth

Finish - Vanilla fades with very little heat. Complex on the back end. Fruity. Smokey and nutty."
4.25,Floral with a bit of chocolate.  Very approachable for this bottling at 63.1%
