4.75,"Delicious. Smoke, apples, pear, cinnamon, and peat on the nose. Continues into the palate with warm spices and more smoke. Finishes super smooth and leaves peat to hang out until the next sip."

아드백 블래ㅐㅐㅐ액 
캐스크 : Pinot Noir

향 : 케이스의 블랙 양을 보고 향을 맡아서 그런지 검은양 털 깊숙히 코를 박은 듯한 느낌입니다. 피트경험이 많이 없지만, 아드백의 차분한 피티함이 오늘따라 맘에 듭니다. 스모키한 피티함이 라프로익이나 탈리스커와는 확연히 다른 느낌이고, 오히려 쉐리나 버번족들이 더 쉽게 피트에 도전해볼수 있는 향이지 않을까 하는 생각이 들 정도입니다.
시간이 더 지나자 스모키함이 차분히 깔립니다. 입을 벌리고 마시듯 향을 맡으니 김밥마는 발 향처럼 나무향이 납니다.

맛 : 피노 누아 캐스크 답게 입 안에 머금자 먼저 '가볍다' 느낌이 듭니다. 그러면서도 동시에 '스모키함의 단단한 알맹이가 있다' 는 느낌이 듭니다. 과일스러운 느낌 (과일향은 잘 안느껴졌습니다) 이 듭니다. 여러 시음기에 체리맛(피노누아 와인에서도 자주 등장)이 등장하는데 저는 아무리 집중해도 아직 체리맛은 모르겠습니다. 

피니쉬 : 은은한 타바코, 스모크한 연기가 남아있다가 적당할 때쯔음 아주 살짝 부드러운 후추함을 남기고 사라집니다.

4.5,Loved this! You can really smell the pino cask
4.25,"Complex, intense and smooth. Not quite as peaty as Supernova. Definitely a unique, special occasion sipper."
4.5,"Smooth, light up front. Very nice on the pallet. Slight smoke on the back."
4.5,"The pinot noir finish is really working well for me. Not sure if I'd call it a good value, but I definitely don't regret buying it."
4.25,"Peaty nose, with some briney notes.  I can definitely get some of the red fruit aromas from the wine, but they don't jump right out.  I get maybe a mix of cherry or plum as well as red apple.

The taste has a peaty, dry smoke, but it's not as strong as some other Ardbeg releases.  I feel like Ardbeg often has a bit of a vegetal character, and I'm having trouble finding it here, perhaps the fruity wine notes cancel it out.  I am also getting a baked apple flavor as it sits in the glass, although it's not overly sweet.  In the finish, I get some salt and pepper and maybe some pine needles or pine resin.  I also get some mellower red fruit.  I feel like the wine fruit, maybe tames the Ardbeg a bit, for better and worse.  They play nice together... maybe too nice, considering that this is one of the Islay heavyweights.

The finish is quite lingering- it's dry spicy smoke with peppery waves... but I think some of the pepper may be coming from the wine as much as from the whiskey.

If anything, this is smoother and quite a bit easier drinking than I had expected, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but possibly dangerous to sobriety and pocketbook.

I like this.  I'm not sure that I love it, considering this was well north of $100.  Supernova is better, and the price isn't that much different.

I will say that the pinot noir brings something interesting and different, and it actually works pretty well, but it's not going down in history as a classic and celebrated combo.  If anything, I'd actually recommend buying a few moderately priced bottles of pinot noir if you are going to invest in this, if you don't have a lot of previous wine experience.  I'm a whiskey drinker first and foremost, but I've polished off plenty of bottles of pinot over the years, and I think a lot of the interesting aspects of this whiskey would be lost on someone who didn't already have some wine background.

Actually, this gets me thinking how Ardbeg might taste after some aging in a really robust red cask.  Perhaps that is the magic that could take a project like this from good to magical.

I gave myself a small pour of Uigeadail just to compare, and the peat is definitely toned down here compared to the Uigeadail.  I also don't really get the classic Ardbeg smoked meat here, but it is front and center in the Uigeadail.


It's a black sheep and it works, for sure, but I feel like it sacrifices some of it's origin to strike an interesting, milder balance."
4.5,Smoke and blackberry jam on the palate.  A sweeter Ardbeg on the nose.  This is a treat to drink and there are a few layers to chew through.  Get it without a second thought.   On my second bottle.
4.5,"Surprisingly gentle, especially for an Ardbeg"

4.25,"This is Ardbeg with a dash of blackcurrant jam. The Cloudy Bay Pinot Noir casks have added a subtle fruity sweetness rather than the heavy wine influence you sometimes find with such maturations. The jammy notes are very well integrated with the classic Ardbeg flavors, lightly underscoring the peat on the nose and adding a sweet touch to the finish and aftertaste. It’s perfectly executed and a return to form after last year’s disappointing Drum - just poor value at $140."

5.0,"Drammers Club Pour. Amazing whisky loaded with tropical and red fruits. Has notes of Plum, Chocolate, Cherry, Strawberry, Raspberry, Currants, Flowers, Vanilla, Caramel, Citrus, Banana, Plantains, Smoke, Pepper, Peach, Bubblegum, Coconut, Mango, and Pineapple"
4.25,"The nose brought out cherry compote, deep peat smoke, dark chocolate, creosote, no sulfuric tones, and deep floral tones; like roses and marigolds.

For the palate, we get medium red fruits like strawberries/raspberries, a ton of cream, caramel corn, candied lemons/apples, and milk/white chocolate.

Oh yeah, that finish is long... More butterscotch with strawberry syrup... A bit like the Springbank Burgundy, but without the trademark funk they have.  A sweet dram, but the florals and bitters balance it out. No sour tones here.

After a couple drops of water - more anise, black/white pepper, spice and oak properties.

The theme to this dram is definitely ""Strawberryfire"" by the Apples in Stereo. Adore it!  4.25 of 5."

2.0,"So this is a pre review tasting and I'll adjusted for the real one. This is my second glass and I'm trying to decided where to go with this.

Nose - young, medicinal, citrus fruits, banana, and maybe a hint of a red wine. 

Taste - young whisky. A mess of vanilla, oak, salt, brine, bananas, youthful casks, some acidic red wine, and then some sweet mellowing notes and then a spicy finish. 

Every time I try to talk myself into or out of this I come to the same two thoughts. The first is this is young as hell and it shows it in the worst ways and the second is there are some good wine casks used here to help.

Overall at the end of the day, and I'll try and come back if things change...this is another massive failure when taken into context of price. This is corryvreckan with better casking and maybe a few months more age. 

Yeah I'm seriously disappointed in this one. It's not bad whisky...but I'm struggling to score it past a 2.0. 

With others enjoying this I am really looking to find some value, but I keep coming back to these young whisky notes, good wine casks but perhaps cheap bourbon casks leading to them. I guess where I struggle is if some of spices and finishes are sharp casks that were intended or raw spirit that has no place in this. I'm thinking it's youth. 

2.0 an average whisky where I feel many will enjoy it beyond that and many will find this down right offensive."
4.25,Different and nice
4.0,"Thoughts: This is a very good whiskey with excellent marketing and cult like following, which should make it a sought-after whisky for years to come. This tastes like if the  Uigeadail and the Corryvrekan had a baby. In fact that might be a good experiment which may yield twice the amount of liquid for $10 more dollars.  There is more of a plum note weaved into the ash as it lingers for a few minutes. To be honest, and a miser, if this were cheaper the score would increase. I'm not buying a back-up since I don't prefer this whisky to other core expressions in Ardbeg; Though it might make good business sense to do so. I'm glad I bought it, I'm happy its good."

5.0,Awesome. Amazing. I love Ardbeg
4.5,"Thanks to my dad for a great/unique graduation bottle.

This is a viscous whiskey with oily residue on the sides of my glass. A light golden straw color. Nose of sherry, grass, oak, pear and of course smoke. Though the smoke is evident it is quite soft and subtle for ardbeg.

The smoke was hiding in the taste but dissipates and allows other flavors to emerge; leather, ripened plums, tannins. There is a slight medicinal/iodine quality that turns rapidly to Dr Pepper (or is it Root beer?) and finishes long. The leather, vanilla and tannins persist on the finish for a pleasant swirl.

I love this whiskey with the disclaimer I am a big fan of islays finished in wine or port casks (lagavulin distillers edition, for example). I think the fruit stands up well to the smoke and leather typical for the style. Smoke critics will certainly knock this one for a lack of balance; I will gladly buy their share of bottles."

4.5,"It is a bizarre smell that welcomes you, obsolete for an Ardbeg: the full-bodied and brackish peat is there, but tamed by a strong sweet component. Red fruits, green apple, caramel, vanilla and honey mix with acrid and medicinal smoke, alternating the nostrils in a curious dance of aromas. However, we are far from the calmness of An Oa, for example, the peat remains predominant, fiercely smoky and moist, but it declines in unusual sweet and fruity tones, dictated by the influence of the pinot.
The palate reveals the strength of the whisky, with the alcohol content well present at the mouth, together with a very salty and peaty roar with a good peppery touch. But again, a sweet and cuddly profile hides under the muscles of burnt wood, bringing deep caramel notes, almost like sugared almonds, together with ripe fruit (many cherries, then raspberries and peach) and honey. Caribbean cigar tobacco background. It is a continuous alternation of the two souls, who overlap without ever amalgamating really, in an eternal conflict over who should prevail.
In the end, the sweetness comes out defeated, rather long with pepper, smoked seaweed, sea salt and burnt wood.
The balance is precarious, the two souls of the whisky never seem to reconcile, but it is precisely the conflict that makes drinking varied and fun, a variation on the Ardbeg theme that is delicious and curious, an imbalance that perhaps for some is a defect, for me it's a bonus."
4.5,"This Ardbeg expression is my all time favorite, of any I’ve yet had.  It’s like Uigeadail turned up to 11, with the darker, jammy notes picked up from the Pinot Noir cask finishing as opposed to the lighter nuttiness of the Sherry.  Absolutely outstanding.  I wish that this was a regular release and at this higher proof, and I felt lucky to be able to find it and even get a few extra bottles.  Blew my hootch budget for the month when I did.  Cheers!"
