4.5,Like a young whisky but mellowed a bit.  Quite flavorful and enjoyable
3.0,"This dirty blonde colored whiskey sports a Mashbill of Barley and Wheat. This is the aged version of their Drumlish Poitín unaged whiskey.
NOSE: Sweet Vanilla, Caramel, New Leather. Young and feisty with a good deal of heat.
NEAT: Vanilla, Leather and Wood up front...Backed by a dark cocoa note. Not much heat on a finish that leaves a tingly coating of Young Oak.
SPLASH: A dash of water or a large cube makes this a one note Vanilla affair. 
VERDICT: This is a quality spirit, but I'll second @dubz480...the Rúa is miles ahead of this one. This may be the only instance I ever type these words but, I actually prefer the unaged version ""Drumlish"". I would love to see what a little more time in the barrel would do for this one. Keep up the good work, Ollie!"
1.75,"So the last time I was in Charlotte, NC I had sampled the lovely Rua single malt and made a point this time to get to their Distillery. So here I am and this is the other aged expression. It's a wheated Whiskey that's aged for about a year in new heavily charred oak Barrels. Mashbill is unique as it's Made with Wheat and Barley. 
Upon entry it's nice, big vanilla, creamed wheat and brown sugar. After that not much more. It's simple and very young. Unlike the Rua, this one falls short. 
Cheers all!"
4.0,Loads of vanilla. It tastes more complex than it’s less than one year of age would suggest. Delicious and worth seeking out.
