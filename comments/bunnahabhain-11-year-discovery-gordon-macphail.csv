4.25,"I’m a huge fan of a Bunnahabhain and this bottling from G&M is a real stand-out expression.

First off, this is a velvety smooth and creamy dram.  You get a waft of caramel, then a lovely gentle clove and cinnamon note.  This then develops into a surprisingly soft hit of fruit (plum and dried fruits).  It mellows into a finish of citrus and dark chocolate, leaving a long tangy and spicy aftertaste.

You can absolutely taste the influence of the sherry cask maturation.  If it wasn’t for the initial caramel and the softness, I’d be hard pushed to guess that this was a Bunnahabhain.  It has a very Speyside note for an Islay malt.  

At this price point, this is a bargain.  An absolutely delicious dram."
