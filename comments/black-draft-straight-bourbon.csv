4.5,"This bourbon is probably one of my favorites! It’s so rich and yet so smooth at the same time. 

Classic cherry and oak on the nose, though subdued. The whiskey coats the tongue with an oily intense sweetness and finishes a touch dry and oaky. It’s classic bourbon, but where everything has gone right."
