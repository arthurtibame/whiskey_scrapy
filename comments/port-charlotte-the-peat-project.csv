2.0,"Quite disappointed with this whiskey. I absolutely love Islay, heavily peated whiskey like Laphroaig, Ardbeg, LagavuLin. Unfortunately this whiskey doesn't make the cut into permanent rotation. Very young and fiery that is truly relentless. Even with water it just doesn't open up or tame itself. In my opinion it's just straightforward alcohol, ton of peat and spice but lacking balance to make it enjoyable."

4.0,Very smoky without overpowering the other much more subtle aromatic flavours.  Very well balanced while remaining on the smoky peaty side.  I like!

3.0,"Very nice nose, with a peaty and floral palate. The finish tapers off very quickly, with some hint of tobacco."

4.0,I'm always wanted this bottle for its heavily peated style and it really not let me down. If you like the Kilchoman you will also gonna love this.
