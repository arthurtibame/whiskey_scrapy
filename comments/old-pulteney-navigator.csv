4.0,"Hot alcohol arrival, enjoyable sweet and sour notes.  Pineapple notes show up in the middle along with some sour apple, oak and shortbread.  Sweet finish with a little smoke swirling around. Oily and coating mouth feel.  46% and non-chill filtered. Fresh and satisfying."

3.0,"Just starting to explore whiskies, and this one is interesting to me.  I agree with others who say that there is a heat and alcohol burn when taking your first sip.  The flavor was hard for me to figure out - kind of muddled between crisp/refreshing and woodsie.  I'd suggest pushing past first impressions.  This is a fun little scotch with some hidden allure.   Add a little water and the heat gets taken down a notch.    I don't pick up a lot of fruit flavors (but I admit I need to work on my pallete and vocabulary so that one day I can also describe whiskies as having hints of monkey halos sprinkled with confectioner's sugar and a lingering hints of carmelized bee wings).  

Anyway - for my Neolithic description I'd say it reminds me of the beach.  But not a sunny day at the beach, more like a cool Fall day early morning on the beach.  Texture is oily - but not in a bad way.  I enjoyed the way it coated my mouth and lingered after each drink.  Not a lingering flavor, but a lingering feeling.  

Like a woman you may end up marrying, first impressions from across the room may be best ignored - walk over and say hi.  This is a fun whisky.   I like it."
2.0,"Nose opens with strong oak. There's a hard alcohol edge suggesting very young spirit. Still bright and fruity with green apple, lemon zest, maybe even grapefruit zest. Slight salty caramel sweetness. Grassy and mossy/boggy.

Not much in the way of body once it hits the tongue; thin, very little legs. Sharp, hot alcohol attack even with water. Grassy, salty, oaky. Longish, very spicy finish. Pineapple and grapefruit. Perfumey in a way my palate isn't robust enough to identify. Slightly salty at the end but the least of any Pulteney I've tried."

3.0,"Nose is a bit of fruit and sugar, almost like a pear pie if there was such a thing. The palate opens sweet and silky, and goes mostly nowhere from there.  It's a bit sweeter than the 12yr, but lacks the depth and complexity, instead replacing them with  astringency and dryness.  The fruit and brine are most noticeable in their absence.  This isn't really representative of the core expressions, and you would do yourself well to stick with them.  Especially the 17yr."

3.0,"Not a bad dram, but it certainly does not measure up to the 12. The use of casks is quite clever and gives this whisky a multilayered dimension, but it has its flaws. There are pleasant notes of Granny Smith apples, almond paste, nutmeg, and dark chocolate. They all come together nicely, but it somewhat goes sour towards the finish. Quite literary too. The finish is bitter, though the touch of salt is nice. The 17 and 21 are better options."

null,"""** Disclaimer: This review is what I would consider a “Quick Hit”- meaning I won’t have my usual in-depth notes that I usually like to take. The reason: this sample was poured at Whiskyfest DC on 4/17/18. All of these reviews will not be scored and I am actively looking to try them again at some point to do them more justice.

After being slightly disappointed by the VIP pour of the OP 35 I eventually worked my way back to their booth to try the 25yo and the Navigator.  This NAS was surprisingly good even though the heavier than expected salt and sea notes powered the malt while leaving behind a bit of soapiness hanging around longer than I’d have preferred.  It was still mostly enjoyable and I’d like to try it again soon.  The 25yo was the highlight from the OP booth.  More on that one later."

3.0,Dramfest `18. Towards of end of day 2 and near the 80 mark from memory so it didn't really have much of a chance. Came across as pretty standard. Solid 3....will have to crack open a bottle of the 21 I have some time :-)

4.0,"This is an excellent example of how cask selection changes the personality of a whisky...try this side by side with the 12 year old. The 12 is full, fruity, salty, and citrusy, with a little vanilla swirling about; Navigator, meanwhile, holds on to the slightly salty quality, but showcases more of shortbread than vanilla, orange peel rather than lemon, and substitutes the fresh fruitiness for darker, sherry-tinged dried fruit. It's absolutely delicious, though my personal preference is still for the 12 year."

Attaque très caramélisée, belle rondeur, beaucoup d'arômes. On sent bien l'alcool mais pas trop. Un whisky de dessert.
Finale agréable mais un peu trop sucré pour moi. Quand même un whisky sympa."

3.5,"For a 46%abv malt, this is a rather simple dram. The bottle is very beautiful but what's inside is what matters. Easy drinkable and fairly decent, this is not a bad dram, but nothing to lose your sleep either. 

Bottled at 46% abv, amber color.

On the nose, honey and toffee, very fresh. Pear is also present. Sweet aroma. 

On the palate, honey, corn flakes (honey corn flakes), sugar, slight wood flavor like cork. 

Aftertaste is interesting, chilli is the spice here, not unpleasant. 

Overall this is a fair dram. 78 over 100 can be a decent score for it."

3.75,"Here we've got an NAS limited edition release from Old Pulteney. Old style packaging; they've recently revamped their entire line-up. I've read many reviews that indicate that this was not for the better.

This Navigator release comes from the previous generation of Pulteney products. Let's  see if this an NAS release is on par with the (old) 12 year of which I am very fond.

Nose: At 46% ABV this thing really pops out of the glass. There is a big jam note that bears credence to sherry cask-aging. More standard notes of apple, honey, vanilla, and toffee. A little grainy, and obviously young. A sulfuric note that is a bit unpleasant.

Palate: True to its reputation as a coastal malt, there are some distinct salty, maritime notes. A bit of cranberry and fig/date representing the sherry cask, while more of the standard toffee, honey, vanilla, apple, caramel, cereal, and butterscotch fill out the palate. Green apple jolly rancher. At the back end I pick up some milk chocolate and some citrus notes (a bit of lemon and lime juices.) Big improvement over the nose. 

Finish: Woody and spicy. There's still some sea salt, but now it's complimented by black pepper and cinnamon. The higher ABV makes itself known here. More green apple Jolly Rancher. There's a bit of jammy, fruity sweetness before this moderate-long finish reaches its conclusion.

Certainly a good one. Definitely not a great one. Outside of the maritime qualities, it's not particularly unique. It's young. If you can get the Oban Distillers Edition for around $75, I would spring for that as your sherry/bourbon cask aged coastal highlander. This was $49 for reference.

Head to head with the (old) 12 year, I'd choose the latter. The 12 is just a better expression of Pulteney's potential. Though I will say, I think 46% was a good choice for this one and would be a good choice for the 12. 

As for the Navigator, it's good as is, but I'll admit, you aren't missing much if you don't pick it up before it's all gone. This simply needed more time in the casks, or perhaps just better casks. Either way, I assign this a 3.0 for being perfectly average.

EDIT: Three months later and I'm back. The nose is lacking and even a bit unpleasant, but the palate and finish have improved greatly. This has really opened up. Bumped from 3.0 to 3.75. Furthermore, I may have changed my stance on how this stacks up to the 12 year (old packaging). More on the latter to come later on."
