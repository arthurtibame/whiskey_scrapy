4.75,The last of the 4 Texas Whiskeys I tasted this weekend and wow - this one doesn't disappoint. It's amazing what this distillery can accomplish in such a short amount of time. This time the subtlety of this spirit sticks out. Where I normally look for the big and bold character out of Texas whiskeys - this is the opposite and amazing for it. The light fruits balance by a small amount of phenol is fantastic. Along the same lines as Glenfarclas. WELL DONE BALCONES! There is a reason why this distillery is one of the leaders in the craft distilling movement.

4.5,"Balcones is known for making amazing whiskey. Most of what they do is very bold, loud and rich. This bottle is a little bit different. It is still recognizably Balcones but it’s lighter and softer. This bottle wants to be a little bit more grown up. Don’t be fooled though this is still a Balcones. A Balcones for slower quieter times. Find your favorite chair, put on some blues. Then sit on back and enjoy."

2.0,"Not at all like a ""single malt"". Spicy, not much flavor. Expensive."
5.0,"Fantastic single malt similar to scotch! The Mirador is one of Balcones annual releases. It’s lighter and fruitier than the “1” single malt, but still maintains that richness found in their whiskeys. This has been my favorite offering from Balcones. I’m currently nursing my 10th anniversary bottle while waiting for the 2020 version."
4.75,Lots of bright red fruits on the nose with just a hint of ethanol but dissipates quickly once it breaths a few min. Blackberries and cinnamon apple take over as well. Palate is loaded with layers of fruit that yield to vanilla and caramel and then finishes with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. Very smooth with a medium/long finish which is surprising given the fact that this whisky only ages for 2-3 years!

5.0,My favorite American single malt. The used oak and Texas heat made it perfect!
