3.0,"Well at a wine and food show you aren't going to get top whisky so a name like Muckle Flugga shouldn't have been a surprise. It looks suspiciously like a play on words I thought..having shades of similarity to a two word offensive phrase but no its a small rocky island north of Unst in the Shetland Islands. Uh but its a Speyside? Yup but its matured the final year on Unst. Not a bad drop, solid 3 I'd give it. Way better than the Broxburn abomination. First fill ex-bourban."
