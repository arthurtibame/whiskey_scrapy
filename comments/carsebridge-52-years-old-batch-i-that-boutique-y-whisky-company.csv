4.0,"Lets start by telling everyone that i normally despise grain whisky. And when i say i despise grain whisky, i find rye whisky the most awful of them all. Lets get the things even more interesting: i bought this 52yo sample with another sample, an invergordon 41yo which was horrible. 

After explaining all this, i got to say that i am very happy to have bought this sample, to have tasted my oldest whisky up to this date and that i really enjoyed it. 

On the nose it is absolutely beautiful. It really surprised me. Super sweet, Creamy, Rye, custard cream, Caramel and vanilla; Herbal vanilla plant, Acetone dim note, Banana, Bronzer. Sweet very sweet Lemon pie.

The palate is not as good, but still a fairly decent dram. Hot not unpleasant. Cream, Dark chocolate dim note. Rye all over the place,  a typical rye whisky. Rye clove spice turns bitter; and After a couple minutes gets sweeter. Finish is medium but actually was in my mouth after a long while that i took a glass of water.

I feel that i have enjoyed the best single grain whisky so far, 83 over 100."
