3.5,"Another one of JW experiments, this time a 2017 release (it seems like it was not that long ago) a blended scotch whisky finished in casks that held Caribbean Pot Still Rum. 

Bottled at 40.8% abv, light golden color.

On the nose it is amazing. I had no faith on this whisky before opening it, since the other blender's batches i have had from Johnnie Walker were just regular. But the nose on this is great. Smells like rum. 100%; Tobacco Dry grass. Vanilla

Feels young on the nose and turns grainy quickly. Butter. Rum notes have faded to a standard grain whisky, the most standard one you can imagine.
Liquid artificial lemon, like the one bartenders pour on rum cocktails on a bar. 
Maybe a hint of pepper. Vanilla cake. Got to say it is young but the aroma meets the criteria to be exactly what they claim it is.

After a first sip, it gets like a cuba libre with lemon artificial juice. It is a rum cocktail.
A great dulce de leche note is also present. 

On the palate, it is not that great, but still not a bad dram: Bitter notes are the most notorious. Dark cake. Vanilla, Prunes and Pepper. A little Oaky/woody. 
A slight dulce de leche note that quickly turns bitter. Acid overall. Just like a rum. 

Aftertaste is awful. Off-putting the first sip. Super Dry, it tastes like a piece of cardboard box. Raw rice. Like tasting a dead leaf or licking a piece of paper. Although the second sip is slightly better, it is still very dry. A little pepper can be detected. Luckily is a short finish. Terrible. 

Overall, this went downhill way to quickly and way too abruptly. It lost so many points on the aftertaste than the resulting score of 70 over 100 could deceive you into believing this is a regular whisky, but really the finish is so bad that i wouldn't even think to buy it again. I know this JW collection is for cocktails and mixing, and i can see this going great with coca cola AND THAT SAYS A LOT ABOUT IT."

3.5,"Day 6. Johnnie Walker. Walker is always a bit of a fifty fifty for me, some are good, some are questionable. This falls on the good side. 

First thing that I noticed was a rather sharp alcohol smell. Unusual for the proof. It's only in the nose, not the taste, but it caught me a bit off guard. 

The rest of the notes on the nose are pretty much what I expected. Raisins, brown sugar, vanilla, caramel, drieg figs, all on the sweeter side. This just screams dessert. 

Taste is rather similar to the nose. There is also some cocoa, sugar, raisins and caramel, but the figs have been replaced with dates. Almost a bit too sweet and one dimensional, but for the money still allright. 

The aftertaste is more of the same, but it kinda painted a very specific picture in my head: Vanilla Pudding, caramelized with brown sugar. I kinda want that now. 

So yeah, all in all a rather sweet mess, but at least a pleasent mess. I need to be in the mood for something like this to really enjoy it, but it's friendly and easy to drink, and not very expensive. Can't give it more than 3.5 though, far too one dimensional."
