3.75,I was a little disappointed.   Prefer the Double Oaked which is one of my favorite bourbons.

4.25,"Nose: rich caramel and surprisingly not much oak. 

Mouth: 90 proof makes it very mild and smooth. Somewhat oily and rich.

Palate: where the nose lacks oak, you get it immediately on the palate. Oak fades into more rich caramel (think werthers candies). 

Finish: moderate. Lingering taste of oak but finish also reveals notes of vanilla and butterscotch. 

Rating: 4.25 of 5. Nose is incredible, taste is great, mouth feel is lacking. Would benefit from being creamier/more oily. 

Would still pay retail $50 for the 375ml bottle"
4.25,Everything about this release signifies subtlety and restraint. The nose is a little but oaky but mostly smells of butterscotch or caramel to me. The palate matches up with those soft dessert notes and an added buttery richness. The finish has a short pepper spice to it that accumulates in heat with each sip.

4.75,"Nose- Candied almonds, musty oak, caramel, vanilla, strawberry jam

Palate- Wave of dusty oak, cherries, caramel, bitter almonds

Finish- Medium, drying finish with notes of oak, caramel, and sweet fruits 


This surprised me in a great way. I was expecting an overpowering amount of oak, but it’s perfectly balanced. Lovely, sweet nose, with unique flavors of strawberry jam and almonds. The palate introduces a heavy amount of oak, with deep cherry notes and caramel. The finish could be longer, but this whiskey is great."
4.75,Amazing.  Almost sweet taste.  Very deep
3.0,Sweet nose almost like a strawberry scratch and sniff pencil. Unsurprisingly dominated with a strong oak flavor. Bitter with a short to medium finish. Little spice. Thin on the mouth feel. Very little nuance and not as balanced as double oaked.
4.0,A notable addition of smoky oak withspicy good finish.
4.5,"WR Double Oaked was an early favorite of mine, and I have long since wanted to get my hands on this extra special rendition.

Alas!

Nose - brown sugar for days, so sweet, marzipan, cherry, and...brownie batter?
Mouth - warm, syrupy, sweet, oaky tannins. WOAH sudden savory smoked meat (what?)! Like buttery rendered pork fat fresh off the smoker. 
Finish - smooth, no heat, so sweet.

Okay, so maybe I’ve been drinking a little, but I’m not kidding about the surprise savory notes that came out of nowhere. I’m gonna attribute that to the smokey/woodiness coming from the extra time in the second toasted barrel.

5/5 for excitement and uniqueness, 4/5 because it's significantly sweeter than I'd normally prefer, so let's split the difference.

Man this one was fun, let’s go again!"
