5.0,"Another beautifully balanced whisky from Laphroaig. The interplay of smoke and sherry is beguiling, providing a smooth, leathery mouthful that is neither as overpowering as the distillery's 10-year-old nor as sweet as many a sherried scotch. An aroma of dates and figs lingers in the mouth and the glass. (Drinks by the Dram sample 3/6/16)"

5.0,"Another special Laphroaig release, although I don't believe this one was dedicated to their 200th anniversary.  This is a NAS single malt that the distillery is describing on the front of the label as ""the richest of the rich"".  Oh boy, I got a feeling I know what I'm in for...

Burning embers.  The after campfire ash.  There's a ton of smoke, but thankfully there's a serious richness to this that makes it hang around on your tongue and make you want more and more and at 96 proof it'll send you to bed early if you let it.

If (like me) you felt let down with Laphroaig's last special release- the 200th 15 Year Old, rest assured they totally redeemed themselves with Lore.  This is the Laphroaig I know and love."

5.0,"Lore is somewhat controversial among longtime lovers of the distillery who see it as a harbinger of an uncertain future.  Laphroaig has gradually eliminated its age statement offers besides the flagship 10-year offering.  The 15 went the way of the dinosaur, came back as a special release in 2015, and now is gone again.  The 18 followed last year, so it’s still available in some places but no longer being produced.  The successor to Laphroaig 18, in price at least, is Lore, which has no age statement but commands a hefty $100-125.  Happily, it does a credible job of justifying that bill, although I’d advise real fans to stick to the cheaper and punchier Laphroaig 10 Cask Strength.  Lore is an example of no-age-statement whisky done right.  The heavy smoke and brine that wafts of the glass is enticing.  While that powerful peat likely comes from young liquid, Laphroaig has selected or balanced the other components to mask any of the downside of that less refined scotch.  The richness of the palate, which has a pecan pie quality combined with caramel or toffee notes that reminded me of a bourbon, is first-rate.  Blackberries and other dark fruits delight the tongue while that smoke prevents it from becoming saccharine.  Strong kick at the finish:  smoke, brine, cocoa nibs.  The marriage of different woods here produces a best-of-both-worlds effect rather than the master-of-none mediocrity of Select.  If you purchased and blended together Laphroaig 10 Cask Strength and PX Cask, I suspect you'd get something close to Lore."
4.25,"This is a great whisky. A rich mahogany profile advertises an interesting combination of first-fill bourbon and sherry wood influences. The 48% ABV does nothing to inhibit a lavishly elegant nose produced by way of both American and European oak. These strains plied the spirit, in some ratio, for more than two decades, and quarter-cask components were also part of the mix. Along with this dizzying harmonization of wood tannins, a light campfire smoke also permeates mixed with the sweet aroma of malted barley and a replication of scents experienced recently at the Laphroaig distillery when standing in their kiln and looking up through the blackened rafters which form its pagoda roof chimney. The palate opens incredibly smooth with more light smoke blended with flavors of vanilla, almonds, raisins, and bakery goods all enhanced by the fresh salt air of a seaside festival. No water is necessary despite the hefty proof.  The finish is rich, dry and satisfying with the assurance of a whisky masterfully crafted to celebrate 200 years of artistry in spirit making. Hopefully, the new Japanese landlords will continue to hold onto this successful formula and only add their expertise in whisky making and marketing where necessary. A solid 4.25 stars."

Following suit, a bold medley of tobacco, ash, tar, stone fruit, black pepper and cinnamon follow on the palate. The finish is long, smoky and lingers on with a pleasantly sweet aftertaste. Simply fantastic."

Typical smoke and peat as other Laphroaigs, but what makes it a bit different is the finish.  Long lingering smoky mint after taste.   Worthy replacement for the 18.

It has a nice darkness to it that is comparable to the Ardbeg Dark Cove, but is it as good?  Well, unfortunately, I don't think so, but if you lean more toward the peaty edge, you'll disagree with me."

4.5,"Ah boy, Laphroaig you rarely disappoint. I wet my palate with the 10 to ease myself into the lore (sadly after a long while open it's faded). I needn't have bothered.  Initial hit left me nervous searching for flavor for a micro second then it's richness washed over my taste buds. Oily sweetness quickly followed by rich, smoky, ashy, medicinal peatedness. Brine, dried fruit and cough medicine mingle in. Definitely 4.5...one of if not my top equal Laphroaig's. I'd love to get my hands on a full bottle and see how it'd evolve over time. Ah value for money.. now that's a tough one. I could get two An Cuan's or nearly 3 10's for for the same price of $125USD. 4 or 5 4 or 5. 4.5 it is now distiller has 1/2 ratings."

null,"Wow, what a smooth and delicate mouth entry this has for such a gnarly tasting brand. I remember My dad giving me laphroaig years ago (back in my jack n’ coke days) and upon tasting it I immediately looked at him like “are you fucking maaaad?! Being nearly 40 now I have recently learned how to appreciate a heavily peated scotch - the trick for me (if you might want to know) was PATIENCE- and trying a higher end batch; where the taste of a natural  earthy smoke truly enhances the flavor - not a light scotch that seems as if it was incidentally flavored with artificial smoke, disjointed and compartmentalized throughout the experience. For me; the entry point for my interests was Corryvreckan. 
Now back to Lore- wow, what and interesting addition to my collection - the nose was the part that perked my interest first - ... obviously .. it initially has that classic medicinal laphroaig Smokey nose - but then within 5 minutes it started morphing into red berries — it was then that I feared the taste; I feared disappointment.... having been let down by so many $100+ dollar bottles; I reluctantly ... reluctantly lifted my glass for the tasting,.. and then - wow. Upon entry to the mouth It’s one of the smoothest whiskeys  I have ever tasted, then it proceeds to developed itself into to many many more flavors as it moves around inside your mouth- it finishes with just enough burn and on the back end to  give you your money’s worth. If you like peated scotch - you will definitely like this.   ——Now I’ll proceed to run my mouth because I can: Suntory/Beam- don’t fuck this one up- you have plenty of products to slowly diminish for profit by diluting, removing the age statements, but yet still raising the price- please keep the quality and aging just like you did on batch one- you already started stomping on the toes of faithful laphroaig customers by removing the 18yr AND the 15yr ; so what’s next? INCREASE quality? I think not- I’m sure Suntory has some fresh new hot shot execs that are interested in quickly lining their pockets while getting ⭐️⭐️⭐️gold stars on the tally board though “efficiency” by temporarily, if not permanently removing some of the timeless, natural, historical practices and ingredients that subtly enhance the flavor of whiskey- which could then only temporarily increase profit🤑💍⛳️🏦📈  - that is until they quit Suntory and move to the next firm. 🙇‍♂️ 
MANY Executives that control these companies pay dividends to themselves and shareholders; it requires the drug dealer mentality (just like every other corporation out there who sells liquid) - “cut it with the cheaper stuff to increase profit” - it’s done with quick, quiet conversations, subtle eyebrow raises and gesture among the top guys- they mean no harm; but in time enough personal interests and dividends paid out of old companies is funded usually by product degradation and price hikes- laphroaig has recently been guilty of both of these.

Boys at laphroaig: Don’t do it - go harvest your profit by watering down Kessler, Courvoisier, Canadian club, beam rye or one of your other wackamol brands - leave laphroaig alone, and please - bring back the 18yr - you schmucks. Lore is great, but at $130+ it’s almost ethically unacceptable because it has no age statement, or official ongoing batch transparency - it’s slippery slope to buy into. Laphroaig - this is a good whiskey; don’t fuck this one up for a quick buck."

5.0,"The initial nosing greeted me with campfire smoke, ash, sea spray, leather, sweet oak,  band-aids, iodine and a mineral note.  After 10 minutes in the glass aromas of nuts, apples, strawberries, caramel and vanilla emerge.  At 20 minutes I picked up hints of lime, ginger, maple and chocolate.  Yum!  I could nose this whisky all day.  There is a lot going on in the glass with many layers of unfolding scents and aromas.  The arrival on the palate is marked with notes of honey, brine, caramel and apple. A burst of campfire smoke, ash, iodine, charred oak, leather and pepper quickly follows.  The whisky is rich, buttery and full-bodied.  The finish is quite long, initially heavy with smoke, ash, leather and charred oak.  As the smoke subsides, the sweetness again peeks through with flavors of caramel, apples and  strawberries.  Nuts, dried dark fruit, vanilla, cinnamon and a mineral note come through on the back end of the finish.  Absolutely delicious!  I paid $85 at my local B&M, which is a great deal.  I think I'll pick up another bottle or two before the sale ends."
5.0,"Review transfer from Barreled from September 2016. 

The newest NAS release from Laphroaig (not counting the annual Cairdeas releases). 48% ABV and non chill filtered. I do believe colorant is being used, but not much.  From everything I have read, Lore will be a permanent addition to its core lineup, replacing the 18 YO which will be discontinued. 
The nose is heavy medicinal/iodine/bandaid as are most Laphroaigs. Brine, seaweed and maritime air. Bonfire smoke and ashes, like smelling the clothes you wore around a bonfire the next morning. Once you get past the peat and smoke there is a slight vanilla note. Dark chocolate and some sherry fruitiness. If you are strong willed enough to let this sit in the glass for a while you will get a sweet toffee and light floral note

Rich oily mouthfeel that is hard to find in most other scotches. Slightly peppery on the palate with more brine, smoke, bonfire ashes and a gentle sweetness 

The finish is medium long with more smoke/ashes, slightly peppery and sweet

This is classic Laphroaig but kicked up a notch. If you are a fan of the Quarter Cask, as I am, you will love Lore. It's like QC + Awesome. The only reason I am not giving this a full 5 stars is because of the price. $140 for a NAS is a bit steep considering QC is nearly as good at less than half the price.  Still, amazing stuff.  My favorite Laphroaig yet!  4.75"

5.0,"Well done Laphroaig. With the Lore you've produced something that proves not all NAS releases are a waste of time and money. On the contrary, this stuff is fantastic.

On the nose,  I agree with the expert notes of briny peat and roasted nuts. Heavy smoke and ash. I also detect a very faint sherry sweetness. Slight fruity notes of plum and pomegranate as well. Very potent and very complex.

On the palate, I am immediately met with a strong note of dark chocolate. It's an artful balance of sweetness and bitterness. The brine and sea salt carry over from the nose. The smoke is still there, but it's significantly turned down as compared to the nose. Once again, there is a faint presence of sherry influence. A slight cinnamon burn somewhere in the middle.

I read something online that described a chili note in the Lore. I find that this is the most apt way to sum up the finish. The sweet and bitter notes become a spicy and that 48% ABV provides a good punch on the way out.

This is a rich and delicious Islay. I highly recommend it, age statement or not. It helps that they are very transparent about the contents of the Lore on their website. I'm more than halfway through the bottle, and I must say that I'm very impressed after being disappointed by my first glass. There's a lot going on here, and I find something new every time I revisit this one.

When I bought it, it was $115. Less than a month later, that same store had dropped it down to a sale price of $80. I don't want to let my unfortunate timing ruin my experience with the bottle though. I'd say it's true value is somewhere in between the two. At $115 I'd still buy it again, and at $80 it's an absolute steal. Well done Laphroaig."

4.0,The peaty taste reminds me of hiking in the Scottish moors
4.0,"Nose: The immediate aroma is floral and fragrant, a honeyed vanilla and musk scent. A full and commanding ashy-smoke note arrives hot on its heels, and you’ve barely registered this before a zephyr of sea breeze blows in, brisk with seaweed, salt, and the smell of a sun-bleached fishing-pier. The nose continues to unfold in layers as the sweet fragrance returns in the guise of orange chocolate and almond fudge. A tiny touch of clove is noticeable behind this, and then the smoke gains prominence again, this time as a peaty plasticine aroma.
    
    Palate: A full and intense arrival with billows of smoke and briny iodine.  Some spicy pepper or chilli, star anise, honey and vanilla appear quickly as it develops. The texture is oily but balanced by the briny tang. There is a shift in focus as you move from nosing to tasting with the smoky character continuing to bloom and dominate the profile while the wine influence becomes less noticeable. Eventually strong tarry phenols are completely in command.
    
    Finish: Medium/long. Drying and smoky from the palate at first, then fading out into sweet iodine-tinged citrus and caramel.
    
    The initial fragrant waft on the nose suggests that there are some very fresh PX sherry casks in this whisky’s background (and maybe even a sneaky red wine barrel). However it’s the assured smoky character that really defines Lore, with the soft fruity-floral tones and briny maritime notes being there to create a counterpoint.
    
    Lore is a melding of many classic Laphroaig elements, both in the nose and palate, and it backs up this mosaic of tone and hue with depth. It’s an interesting whisky that continues to unfold over time and rewards patient tasting.
    
    It has great balance, but of a distinctive kind. Some whiskies have manifold aromas and flavours that are integrated and evenly spread. Lore, however, is like a set of scales with one pan holding lots of fruity, briny and fragrant ingredients while the other is loaded with pure peat-reek – but the two sides are in equilibrium.  It has a very complete and satisfying feel about it that is the direct result of this balanced tension between the dominant smoke and all the other components.
    
    Don’t bother adding water, this is just fine neat.
    
    “Very Good” : 4 stars"

Punches you in the face just a bit less. But, then again... I like to be slapped around every now and then."

4.0,"I have tested Lore three times.   First time was after some Forty Creek Unity.  The Lore was magical.  The second time was after Bowmore 12 and Highland Park 12.  The Highland was rated far higher than the Bowmore and the Lore was rated higher than the Highland.  Another win for Lore.  

Now for the cautionary notes. Lore was tested side by side with Laphroaig 10 by four Scotch drinkers that appreciate peat.  There was silence and lots of back and forth.  Lore was not a clear winner and the 10 not only stood up well it was possibly as good in its own way (not as hot, smoke was more campfire like without the sherry influence). There was no clear statement that Lore was superior.  The samples were repoured as the test was closer than any of us imagined considering Lore is more than double the price of the 10.  

The final verdict - Lore is fantastic.  Now for the “but”.  The 10 is also fantastic and if you like the sherry influence on Laphroaig there is the Triple Wood at a price just above the 10.  In fact you can get the 10 AND the Triple Wood for less than the Lore here.  

For my money I would buy a 10 and a Triple Wood next time.  A 4 due to the price.  If I wasn’t paying the bill it would be a 5. 

Nose - smoke, iodine, sea brine, sherry

Taste - Winter green, pine, salt, iodine, chocolates, band aids, plastic, and the finish reminds me of those candy cigarettes with a touch of chocolate and a hint of actual smoke.  

Really complex, almost overwhelmingly so.  Lore I'm told has whisky up to 30 years old in it all be it I'm sure little of that.

Four characteristics of Laphroaig: peat, floral, rye, fruit

Nose: fresh fruit on the nose.  Some salt.  Hints of peat. As you leave it in the glass, sweeter honey and vanilla notes begin to emerge.  

Taste: floral, sweet notes to start.  Can taste the influence of the Sherry casks.  Then, rye, but smooth rye.  Medium viscosity.  Not tannic.  Not much peat on the tongue, but wait for it!

Finish: smooth, smooth whiskey. When you breathe out, you get the peat. I love how this peat is restrained until the end.  Very good expression.  I've had one bottle, and would gladly buy another."

4.0,"Served in a Glencairn glass, neat, from a full bottle.

Cashews and smokey dark meat, with moderate peat on the nose.

The palate starts off with strong iodine/brine, and while the smoke is present, it doesn't overpower like the 10yr.  Mouth-feel isn't thin like the Triple Wood, but isn't viscous like an Ardbeg Uigeadail.  The sweetness pokes through like sun through storm clouds, in the best way possible  Prunes, apricot, with ginger beer and cinnamon spiciness round out the entry.  The oak comes through strong enough that I would wager there is some old (18+ years) whisky blended for character.  The finish is on the longer side, but the finish is where things unravel, as it were.  The smoked meat really shines here, but the dark chocolate and burned butterscotch notes clash with the iodine/medicinal character, leading to an artificial impression that is somewhat jarring.  The heat is more than I would expect for a non-cask-strength offering, but nothing excessive.

A good dram, but does not stack up to the NAS offerings from Ardbeg.  However, I must disclose that I did not do a concurrent tasting.  Also, while I did everything I could to cleanse my palate, dinner was sweet/sour  with lots of citrus and some botanicals, so I will need to reevaluate another day.

Bottom Line: Ardbeg NAS drams still reign supreme in my cabinet, although I think the Triple Wood is the better buy by a wide margin, compared to the Lore, despite the thin mouth-feel of the TW."

5.0,"I really want to be harsh in my reviews but i am a man who recognizes a work of art. Laphroaig make a lot of them, and this ""Lore"" version is no exception. 

After tasting it i went to its website because i had a sample of this and needed to know more and i found this:

""Laphroaig Lore is drawn from a variety of casks including first-fill bourbon barrels, quarter casks and Oloroso sherry hogsheads to create a unique richness.""

Lore means knowledge passed through generations. And trust me, they deliver a perfect dram. 

Bottled at 48%abv, with an amontillado sherry color. 

On the nose is one of those Laphroaig wonders, not tennis balls this time but SWEATY SOCKS. yep, it was an instant note, easy to detect. More notes on the nose were the obvious Peatyness, sea weed, prunes, ashes, a sense of seafood spicyness and icyness. Truly an interesting dram. 24/25 on the nose.

On the palate it has only a handful of notes, but it was SUBLIME. It is an instant, but pleasant, SPICE BOMB. such a beauty, mouth watering. Chilli is very clear as a note here. Tangerines, spiciness, peanutbutter cream, spiciness, ashes and spiciness, SPICINESS SPICINESS but pleasant, delicious. 

The aftertaste is medium-long with chilli and a dim hotness. BUT SO PLEASANT. 

Overall i give this marvelous dram a 99 over 100 and i absolutely recommend it."

4.25,"As is always the case with a Laphroaig, there is that typical TCP, medicinal taste up front, but this expression is richer than the typical 10y/o.  The upfront taste is rich and spicy with a good hit of alcohol that quickly disperses into a sweet, dry and spicy finish.

I’ve said before that Laphroaig is my ‘go to’ dram and I suspect a bottle of Lore may become a regular addition to my drinks cabinet.  An excellent NAS dram!"

It took me a long time to try this.  I was troubled by the thought that the supposed spiritual successor of Laphroaig 18 year old, one of my favorite whiskies, had no age statement, and the suspicious claim that it is “the richest ever Laphroaig!”  I just thought, oh dear, Laphroaig 18 never tried to be the richest.  I was fearful this “Lore” would be an amateur PX finish.

My first impression of this whisky was that, I’ll be damned, it reminds me of Laphroaig 18.  Medicinal smoke with an oily mouthfeel and grapefruit-flavored candies.  And then I had it alongside Laphroaig 18, and it was a big disappointment.  It’s was like that classic Katt Williams skit about how your Chrysler 300 looks sort of like a Bentley Phantom, until you pull up next to a Bentley Phantom.  Laphroaig Lore is not Laphroaig 18.  It reminded me of Laphroaig 18 because I had forgotten how awesome Laphroaig 18 was.  And then I compared Lore with an older Laphroaig 10, bottled around 2012, and the Laphroaig 10 was much better.

Laphroaig today is not Laphroaig yesterday.  The difference is as stark as comparing something that is Scotch with something that is not.  The Laphroaig 10 from 2012 is a beautiful, confident whisky that lets you approach it.  Newer Laphroaigs, from the modern Laphroaig 10 to their Cairdeas bait, to this Laphroaig Lore is manic, insecure divebar trash that tries to approach you with the subtlety of Cthulhu.  Laphroaig’s sad use of sherry casks is just shouting drunken nonsense to hide spirit of decreasing quality, like mini short jeans and flavored lipstick to hide a hollow personality.

Ahem, that is still to say, if you turn your brain off, Laphroaig Lore can be competent, and even enjoyable.  But, as soon, as you line this up with some real whisky, Lore just becomes this loud pink bubblegum pop! that you’ll be wise to avoid.  If you want a Laphroaig today, go the independent bottler route.

And then, wow!

There is this very heavy medicinal note (classic laphroaig) that is almost overpowering the peat, then comes some smoked meat wrapped in seaweed. So complex that every sip there is something new to explore.

4.5,"A birthday indulgence tonight, and oh what a pleasure!

The nose is like an elaborate, motor-powered model of the solar system: some scents whizzing to the front before dissipating just as swiftly; some drifting slowly closer; all intricately weaving, waxing and waning, intertwining, and overlapping. Stellar!

No alcohol burn on the nose which is surprising for the ABV; light rubber; clove, but with a sweetness like a clove drop; faint creosote I think; something fruity but I can’t tell what; briny, ashtray notes like burnt seaweed; car ferry deck; light peat but it was not the first thing that struck me; pipe smoke – it, combined with the brine and the peat, conjures childhood memories of my great grandfather’s cottage on Achill island; a trace of a woody smell after a few sips.  Overall it is complex and truly enchanting.  Nothing too prominent or overpowering. Supremely balanced. 

There is heat upfront on the palate – I can feel the ABV now. Pepper spice arrival that is also slightly bitter; peat smoke upfront too; earthy, vegetal development; maybe a bit of clove spice too; charred meat; sea salt in the middle and finish; dipping to the lips gives a sweeter profile – brown sugar and licorice; lovely, long, sweet, salty, smoky ash finish – campfire or turf fire ash.  

Yes, this is a muddled ramble; an outpouring of jumbled thoughts - but that’s what this dram can do to you!"
4.5,"Smells like Laphroaig dialed up to ten. Super strong smoke smell, smells more like campfire to me than peat. On the tongue is a bit mellower than I expected.

4.5,"The color, all natural, is a beautiful dark amber.
A powerful and fleshy peat explodes in the nostrils, with a load of burning and crackling wood. Under this blanket of pungent smoke clearly emerge licorice, banana, walnuts and rivers of disinfectant. Sprinkle with marine salinity. An overwhelming and exciting nose, like standing in front of the fireplace chewing licorice while you disinfect a wound by making seawater aerosol (okay, maybe it's not exactly the image I wanted to evoke).
On the palate it is fleshy, intensely burned, almost as if you were eating some bacon wrapped on a burning ember (NOTE: no, do not try). But as for the sense of smell, there is not only smoke but also sweeter notes of caramel, still licorice (a lot), salted butter, dried (walnuts and even almonds) and dehydrated (dates, apricots and let's put some coconut) fruit. The medicinal note remains present but more in the background, while marine salinity is a continuous flow that creeps between the aromas. All this is an harmonic and seductive music, with a pinch of spices that titillates the senses.
The finish is long, very long, ashy and medicinal, with salt and spices that accompany you and you would never like to say hello."

4.75,"As a massive Islay fan Ive read reviews on this and its heralded as some amazing shit. Is it hype or warranted we shall see. Found it at specs for 83$(great price). Poured neat, the Lap heritage is evident on the nose with salt cured bacon roasting in a fire pit, bandaids, menthol and malt just leaping out of the glass supported by ocean driftwood and dense peat smoke. Let it sit a bit and you can pull some anise and clove like spice. Rich and pungent yet ethanol is ghosted. Mouthfeel is diesel thick with palate bursting at the seams. You cannot take it all in on initial taste too much going on. Have to parse it out over subsequent samplings. Deep rich smoky malt, bbq meats, mentholated pinewood, vanilla frosted donut with creamed dark roast coffee power through your senses. Im sure if I wait this out I can pick out much more but its so damn delicious I want to take another pull. Finish is long extension of palate never going dry or tannic just maintaining and sustaining your complete enjoyment of this dram. Salty smoked meats with malt and peat enduring along side aged timbers. The cooling menthol is amplified with a drop if you choose. I can break it down based on the Laphroaig ive had. The 10yr is great and value is very high. The quarter cask is better and worth the upcharge. This is on another level and worth the $$ imo if you want to get the best Laphroaig experience under $100. I fear Im falling into the trap of high cost scotch but the old adage is true here you get what you pay for.....98/100.......pure concentration of flavors and complete lack of off notes or ethanol issues is the difference in pricing levels. Not quite on Lag 16 complexity level imo and Oogie is still a tough out but this is most certainly a major contender with tremendous depth and power"
4.5,"A number of good recent Laphroaig reviews have reminded me that (a) I hadn't had Laphroaig in quite a while, and (b) I had two Laphroaig samples waiting to be consumed - Lore and An Cuan Mor.  I started with the Lore.  

From the first nosing and sip, it both impressed me and surprised me.  It has a deep richness, a meat char peat, a nice fruity sweetness playing in the background, and the trademark medicinal notes at low volume.  Overall, it drifts a bit closer to Ardbeg than any other Laphroaig I've had.  In fact, if I had tasted this blind, I'm not entirely sure I would have correctly identified it as a Laphroaig.  

I was surprised enough that I decided a reality check was in order, so I opened the An Cuan Mor.  I'll review that one separately, but the ashy peat and medicinal notes jumped out at me, confirming my initial impressions of the Lore - it's a Laphroaig, but a bit different.

One caveat here is that I've never had any of the old Laphroaigs, and apparently the Lore has some has some old juice in it.  So perhaps it is a typical Laphroaig - a typical older Laphroaig.  

Regardless, this is a very nice whiskey, and well worth the price.  At $100-120 its just a shade less expensive than some of the great ""18s"" - Highland Park, Talisker, and Caol Ila, but in my opinion it holds it's own in that league."

5.0,"So, I gave this a 5.0.  For me, 5.0s are whiskies that are so delicious that I will do whatever I can to maintain a bottle in my collection at all times.  This is no exception.  I truly believe this is the best expression that Laphroaig has to offer.  On the nose it is slightly smokier than the 10 and offers more of a ""something's on fire"" smokiness as apposed to a char smokiness of the 10.  The brine from the 10 is still very much there, but the medicinal notes are turned down by about half.  I like the medicinal notes of the 10, but it's something I have to be in the mood for.  This, however, offers such a perfect balance between the smokiness, medicinal notes, and the citrus notes that you just don't want to put the glass down.  The mouthfeel is so smooth and so rich and so savory that I seriously could drink a few glasses and consider it a meal.  This Scotch is seriously delicious and deserves the upmost respect.  I don't care what you have to do, but make this Scotch a part of your life immediately."
