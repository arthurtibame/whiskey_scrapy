3.75,"This is my first HAZMAT, had to pick it up when I got word this was available. The particular one I have it
Selected by Bourbon Street W&S, Barrel #1
Barrel V220, Bottle 001
Proof: 146.12 / 73.06%
Age: 14 years

Pour in GC. About 0.5 ounces. I was scared...seriously scared.

N(3.5): Initial smell, so surprised it didn't burn. Light sweet honey on top of a vanilla cookie. If you disrespect it and try to take a big deep sniff after that gentle invite, you will get slapped by the alcohol stick. Mint and peppermint. Added 3 drops of water. Doesn't hurt it at all.
P(4): Surge of sweetness in the front. Totally deceiving. Immediately notice the thick coating. Vanilla. After a second or two in the mouth, the proof gets progressively mean. I tried to hold it in my mouth for ~10 seconds. Like your first time using the yellow Listerine feeling. OOOOHHHH Weee. Take small sips. Flavor goes a long way.
F(4): It is hot. Super hug. From the chest and the fumes. Try to swallow slow and not gulp. Rye. Vanilla. Bright fresh young berry melody. Heavy cream feeling. My favorite part of the whole experience is the initial finish. So flavorful. The oils are still on your tongue with huge flavor. The finish lasts looooong.

Overall: I'm so happy to have it. Not an everyday drinker. Its like going on a date with a HOT model who's crazy. If you don't be careful and skillful, you can die. But you still want that experience."
