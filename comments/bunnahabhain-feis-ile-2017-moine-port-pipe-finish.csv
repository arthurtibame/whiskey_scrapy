5.0,"An unassuming weak tea color in the glass belies the delights that await. It's like a more sophisticated version of the Laphroaig PX, with a darker finish of dried figs. Really opens up with a few drops of water to reveal seaweed, dark chocolate Kit Kats and Ricola herb drops. A 4.6/5, but we'll round it up to five on the starometer. Best of the Feis Ile bunch, which was a surprise given that I've always ignored this distillery."
