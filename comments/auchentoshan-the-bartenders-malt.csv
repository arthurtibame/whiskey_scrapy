null,"Short of flying to Scotland, I have tried everything to find out where I can get a bottle of this in my area. The only consistent answer was “It will be released in Sept” Well it’s October now, does anyone know where I can snag a bottle in the Milwaukee area or at least what doors I should be knocking on?"
4.0,"Soft but full arrival, no initial bite, very well rounded vanilla/cream soda, some saltiness, little almond, oak bite at the finish. A solid dram."
4.0,2018.01.30 - 47% ABV and amazing. Amazing nose. Great taste. Equally good with water but I think I like it better without water. Nice nose!
3.0,I like but needs water.   Cost $49.00
4.0,Good overall.

3.0,"Straight, this has a complex flavor that's heavily masked by its spicy finish. But with soda water, this is a fantastically complex sipper, lots of fruit and caramel with a full oak finish."

3.0,Malty flavor with a hint of smoke.
4.0,"The nose is strong honey, but hints of apple and apricot. There is clearly some caramel notes, a I envision a candy apple the more I smell it. At full strength, it bites, but has buttery notes. A dash of water opens up the flavours, bringing out citrus notes and hints of rum/malt. The finish is nice, soft, and long. This was WAAAAY better then I had expected."

5.0,This is really special. So many flavors going on. Fan of the rum cask. For the first time I enjoyed a clear hint of smokiness from the Laphroaig cask. Definitely exploring that now.

3.0,"Well I have to say that I got sold, I went into the store looking for a very limited not yet delivered bourbon and walked out with a single malt ... ok so the boax was pretty and had some buzz words and being that I'm in sales I appreciate the effort. 

Appearance: a light golden amber with a tint of green notes

Nose: at bottle strength I get Apriocots and honey and floral notes that are very inviting. Add some water and I get some more earth notes, the box calls this the green tobacco leaves so I'll say sure that must be it.

Palate: This is a very young single malt not as complex up front, lots of zest and citrus like an IPA, add a bit of water to cut back on the harshness of the high proof, and it balances out with some sweet floral and buttery notes.

Finish: This whisky likes to linger with some peper and wood notes coming out that seem to be missing from the rest of the experiance but they last so long it balances out in the end. 

I bought this for $46 bucks and I mean the box labels these 12 master bartenders that contributed as the new malt order so I guess for the way things are going to be done moving forward this is a solid whisky."

3.0,Meget blød og rund
4.0,"Thanks to @LeeEvolved, I had this after a long day at the #neveragain march yesterday where I joined my high school aged niece.  On a side note...regardless if your pro or anti NRA, these kids are simply amazing; eloquent, passionate, and angry as hell.  I wish I was like them at their age...simply just impressed by them.  Anyway..I digress...so I’m not a huge Auchentoshan fan.  Aside from their 21 yr old, their other offerings seem just underwhelming.  I feel I can do much better for my hard earned money.  But this, this is a different animal.  Sweeter, honey drizzled almonds on the nose.  Palette falls short a bit, but you still get that typical youngster citrus flavor.  Overall, well made.  Thanks Lee!"

4.0,"I saw this bottle on the bottom shelf at my local liquor store and thought to myself that, while I’m not a huge Auchentoshan fan, this one has quite a high level of eye-rolling marketing going on.  So for $44 I thought, why not?  It will at least mix well.

Let’s start with the marketing:  it’s got shiny copper stickers on the box and bottle proclaiming is an annual (there’s more to come), limited release (collectible) and that this is the first release (#1’s are really collectible).  Yesssssss!  The eye roll part is that Auchentoshan rounded up the 12 best bartender’s from around the world, had them collaborate on this blend AND DECLARE THEM AS THE NEW MALT ORDER!!  (It’s actually on the label). Holy hell, so now if the apocalypse comes I need to find one of these cats so I can get a fitting End of the World cocktail.  Let’s evaluate this whisky before we crown them as saviors, shall we?

Well, first of all, it’s bottled at 47% ABV.  That’s quite hefty and I’d say that the group probably decided a higher ABV was needed for when they were slinging this stuff into flaming cocktails, dumping it across 4 inch ice cubes or planting that cliched umbrella into the highball glass.  It’s light copper in color and makes some nice runny legs if you give it a twirl.  Here’s where things get interesting...

The nose is flat out incredible!  It’s kind of sweet with honey-dipped apple and apricot notes, but then a crazy floral and spice note appears that’s really similar to Four Roses bourbon.  The high ABV really punches up those notes to a higher level.  The smell is mesmerizing.  Well done.

The palate gives away the majority of the youthful whisky at play here, though.  There’s some nice sharp ginger and lemon zest that liven things up very well.  The harshness is still present even into the finish, but I can see where this would hold up really well in a mixed drink.  It’s a bit of a chore to handle it neat, however.  Water may be your friend here.

The finish is long with pepper and oak spices ruling the day.  The mouthfeel is vibrant and not very mouth coating, but that’s okay I think. 

Overall, the cheesiness of the whole NMO thing and the Bestest, Annual, Limited Blah Blah is a bit overplayed, but what counts inside the bottle, is there.  I even saw that Auchentoshan has brought the group back for round 2, so they must be happy with the finished product and sales.  If they keep the pricing around $40-45 I would definitely buy it, and I certainly recommend this batch, as well.  Buy a bottle and sling some crazy cocktails of your own- before the real apocalypse arrives.  4.25 stars.  Cheers, my friends."

4.25,Still tasty
2.75,Hmm I'm with the majority rating on this one. It starts off good but then you get quite an astringent grapefruit ethanolly bitter aftertaste which from memory bedevils other offerings as well. It's one of my three dislikes and the more I drink this the more prominent it becomes. Water and time seem to make it worse. There are a number of distillery's I'm forswearing in 2019 and this one is at the top of the list.
4.25,"Nose: Clementines, chocolate covered raisins, honey
Palate: Ginger, cherry, rocky road ice cream
Finish: Cinnamon, ginger, dried nuts"

3.75,"Chocolate malt! Like warm rich chocolate spread over a warmed ginger cookie. The cocoa continues to linger, with a very impressive mouthfeel and afterburn. Really balanced, with a pleasant spice. Did I mention chocolate malt, lol, it’s the defining characteristic of this bottle"

3.75,Very weak faint wooden oak/fruity nose. Smooth spiced fruit palate. Surprising kick or peppery spice to finish.

4.0,"Really pleasantly surprised by this one! Got it as a gift as my first Lowland bottle, though I’ve tried the Auchentoshan 12 and 18 samplers and was generally unimpressed. 
But this NAS expression hits a great combo of Irish and Scotch, coming across like a Green Spot with a bit extra ‘seaside bite’. Like a cross between Irish and Campbeltown styles. So yeah very much enjoyed this one, and will be coming back to it on the regular!"

3.25,"Purchased this on a whim while in TN last weekend.

Nose: beautiful cocoa nose with a hint of citrus and something akin to cherry (sharpness, might be the chocolate flavor). Brings to mind the chocolate orange slice candy I occasionally had as a child. Little bit of a floral note sprinkled on top of everything too.

Tasting: floral on the front, something spicy (some tastes have mentioned ginger but I’m not terribly familiar with that flavor) follows and then it opens up to something like cinnamon mixed with water - very subtle flavor. The finish isn’t very long and doesn’t hang around. 

Overall not bad! I am more of an Islay guy but in terms of a good sipper this will do. Doesn’t quite get to Speyside characteristics (my least favorite region) but has just enough of the maltiness and a touch of the barrel/oakiness to be a good level of brazen."

4.25,"Scumptuous nose with floral, chocolate, orange and malt notes plus a hint of smoke. The palate starts off a little rough, grungy for lack of a better word, more Neal Young and Crazy Horse than Nirvana, but it morphs, sip by sip, into a Chris Cornell like transcendent beauty touching all the notes of the nose and adding a raspy spice. The finish is long, peppery and satisfifying."
