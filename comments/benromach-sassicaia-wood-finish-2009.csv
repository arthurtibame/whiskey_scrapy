5.0,"This one goes straight to my top shelf. Last year i learn what a Sassicaia Wood finish whisky could be when i had a dram of the perfect Arran Sassicaia, which is discontinued and it melt my heart because i couldn't get a bottle anymore. Not even in wine searcher i could find the bottle. It will forever live in my memory (and stomach). But then, i got an email from one of my typical online stores that said: ""there is this new Benromach Sassicaia wood finish whisky"". And of course i bought it.

It was amazing. Everything i hoped for. 

Bottled at 45%abv, with a unique pink cantaloupe color, never seen before in a dram. My wife says it is ""gold rosé"".

On the nose it was very tropical. Pineapple right away, white chocolate, an ashy spiciness, wet dirt, very perfumed but not too intense. After the first sip it became clear that dry peaches were also present. 

On the palate it was amazing. Only three notes, but super pleasant ones. Hershey's milk chocolate ""Bites""; pineapple and ginger.

The aftertaste was something completely different. A puff of pleasant almost minty-refreshing smoke and ginger. 

For $60 you can't just get anything better than this. The complexity and pleasant tropical flavors are just too well crafted. 96 over 100 and that is because the aroma was a little dim. Sláinte!"

3.75,"Representing speyside findhorn river
Nose: honey, caramel, oak
Body: light
Palate: sweet, vanilla toffee, oak, caramel, chocolate, hint of spice
Finish: short with oak and hint of distant smoke
Note: a very nice dram, very good not great but extremely drinkable. My initial thought was holy oak, and it played out as a sweet , bourbon casks shine through, oak mix that is delicious."
