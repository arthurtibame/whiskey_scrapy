4.0,"Batch 005. This one's a keeper. Laphroaig 10 at cask strength! For the strength and peat, it has a sweet nature about it that I find very appealing. Lemon comes through after adding some water. Beautifully long, smoky and briney finish. I have blended this with a couple of other single malts and it works very well for this!"

4.0,"Batch #008

Sweet nose, barley, 
Taste is strong alcohol, smoke, finish very long and ends with a bit of butterscotch notes once smoke fades 
With water, smoke and wood, really long finish

Tasted at Laphroaig Distillery on 7/27/2016"

5.0,Smoke and brine aroma dominate but vanilla presents itself as you get closer.  Taste is sweet and includes a nice bite.  Overall it's super well balanced and is just excellent.

4.25,"Peat, Smoky, so smooth. I really like this."
4.5,58% abv super wonderful flavor. Heavy peat and brine. Salty and flavorful. Much darker than expected. This stands up to the likes of Octomore cairdeas and corryvrecken. Great value
4.25,"Great Islay profile. Loads of smoke before water, but not much more to it. Water opens it up as expected. Good balance of fruit and smoke. Much better with a touch of water. Not as great as Ardbeg or Lagavulin, but you can’t beat it for the price point. Great starter Islay."
