2.0,"Whisky Club 2: $87 AUD for a 700ml bottle. Consensus was that it was pricey due to volume as opposed to craft. Beautiful nose on the initial smell, lingers with vanilla and floral tones. On first taste, sharp and full, with a pleasant blossom to vanilla and sweet notes. However it's an abrupt finish, which peters out without much fullness."
3.0,"Sharp initial taste, great vanilla aroma and initial cereals.    Slight smokey aftertaste with light peppers.  Disappears of f your palette to quickly."

5.0,"Sweet, luxuriant, fruity, with notes of coffee and toffee! Very creamy... Sadly I didn't write enough down to do this whisky justice.
It is delicious, however better whiskys exist in this style, like Scapa 16 Year (out of stock, which I had a glass of the same evening I tried this) or G.Rozelieures Rare with its own coffee, cherry, caramel and fruit notes, its own creamy toffee, but with added peat."
4.0,Oily in a very good way.

2.5,"Nose: Malt, vanilla, oatmeal cookies, wholemeal toast, a very light touch of oak. As it rests in the glass the vanilla note becomes more prominent.  Adding water opens the nose considerably. [The dry glass aroma is like toast soaked in ethanol].

Palate: A firm, almost sharp, malty entry with some ginger spice emerging in the development. There's a hint of charcoal, but it's not a ""proper"" smoky note. A slightly beery flavour. It's a pretty simple and shallow palate overall. A dash of water softens the otherwise almost intrusive spicy note and reveals a little cereal sweetness. The texture is slightly oily and agreeable.

Finish: Medium. Cereal and malt, with a salty/sweet and sour aftertaste that lingers.

Hellyers Road distillate is reminiscent of Irish pot-still with a focus on the cereal characteristics. It's a crisp and lightly fragrant whisky made to a high standard but it lacks complexity, particularly in the palate.

It is greatly improved by the addition of water. Neat it seems very tight and closed-in, but a dash of water makes it blossom and become much more approachable.

An OK single malt - not great, but OK - but a bit overpriced. I'd equate it with Glen Grant 10 in the scotch single malt world. The official rating here seems overly generous, but it's a young distillery and there may be strong batch variation.

""Average"" : 2.5 stars."

3.0,Mild nose but fully assertive taste. Low in vanilla and caramel but a slice and toast/malt is present. Very forward with a mild linger.

4.0,"This seems underrated and feel like having breakfast by a campfire - strange but it works. Biscuits followed by smoke 

Feels like the laddie 10 and just maybe as good of not better"
