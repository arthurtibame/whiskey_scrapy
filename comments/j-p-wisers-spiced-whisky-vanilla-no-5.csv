4.0,This is something to enjoy when you want to try something not too serious. Vanilla is in the name and it does not hold back. Nice tight spice on the lips with a decent finish. Easy to capture the vanilla on the nose as well. On the cheaper side but worth trying as a drink to finish off the night easy.
3.0,"Caramel and maple nose with sweet vanilla, spice follows but lighter than I expected from name, alcohol a touch hot in finish, which is where this falls short from some other things I have had lately."
