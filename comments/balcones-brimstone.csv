4.5,"Was expecting something with a few sharp edges, but was pleasantly surprised.  A nice unique taste for sure, but nothing too crazy.  I've had & loved the Balcones Rye, Single Malt & True Blue Cask Strength (63.1%), so clearly my palate is attuned to Balcones.

My only gripe is the price here in Australia (AUD$125); would love it to be closer to $100 but as it stands it's not a bottle I can easily replace (especially when I can get ECSB for around $50 less).

Pity we can't get more of the range out here, but am thankful for what we do get."
4.5,Tasting brisket the good kind.
4.5,"Call me crazy but to me this is one of my all time favorite whiskeys. I will always have a bottle of this on my shelf; imagine a smokey and slightly sweeter Blanton’s and that’s Brimstone. It is fantastic, the price can be a tad bit lower in my opinion but if you are adventurous I’d recommend this immensely."

4.75,"This is probably the easiest review I’ve ever written, because everything about this whiskey is just so damn in your face; NO subtlety here. 

Get a whiff of this and you get fresh grilled elote, Texas style BBQ sauce, beef jerky, burnt tires, French burnt peanuts candy, and grill char. Go in too deep and you get a blast of ethanol that when combined with the aroma completely disables your sense of smell for 30 seconds.

As for the flavor, just read the nosing notes above because it’s all there in the palate as well. In case you can’t quite grasp it, this is like drinking “burnt ends” barbecue in whiskey form. To say the flavors are “bold” is like saying the sun is hot. 

Finish redefines “long” as you can still taste it 20 minutes later and it obliterates your taste buds for the rest of night. Forget about tasting any other whiskeys (or hell any other anything) after drinking this beast. 

Mouthfeel is “total”. Coates every last inch of your tongue. 

I’m probably full of shit because they probably didn’t have anything remotely like this but it’s easy to imagine this would be what an “old west cowboy bourbon” would taste like. As someone who enjoys over the top flavors I guessed I might like this and I was right. But it’s not going to be everyone’s cup of tea. You must know thyself to know if you will enjoy it. If you are the kind of person that eats raw habaneros, and drinks Triple IPAs or 15% ABV stouts, this might be your jam. Challenging. Ridiculous. Unique. Delicious. Rebuy."

4.0,"Holy smokes! A new taste. A new whiskey... Sorry, whisky. I love it when a distiller takes my taste buds on an adventure they've never been on before. Brimstone is a rich and smokey experiment that actually worked. All corn in the mash bill, but even a casual drinker can tell this isn't Kentucky bourbon. Spicy, smooth, savory but not terribly inviting. A worthy investment of time and imagination, but it's flavor isn't for everyone. Balcones has been getting a lot of press, and deservedly so. Brimstone is a fun offering, and it's safe to assume we can expect great things from this distillery in the future."

4.0,"NOSE: Very unique to me. Lots of cornbread, but the smokiness makes it smell like BBQ sauce. There's a hint of vanilla there, but buried under the smoke.  PALATE: A little sweeter than the nose got me expecting. Obviously still smoky, and the cornbread comes through. But also some brine, molasses.  FINISH: A little burn, but a long finish that's less smoky than the nose or taste. It's still there, but getting more traditional bourbon flavors on the finish of vanilla and some caramel. The saltiness of the palate sticks around too.  THOUGHTS: I found this a very unique bourbon, and really enjoyed mulling it over. It's not something I would want to drink regularly, but I'm glad I bought the bottle for when the mood strikes."

3.0,"Really unique.  I'm still quite not sure if I like it or not.  The nose is really like BBQ chipotle pineapples or peaches, then the taste is smoky brisket.  It's not the same smoke as what you'd expect in an Islay or Islands scotch.   I can almost imagine myself having this when I'm grilling outside.  Big bold Texas flavors.  Definitely worth trying, not sure if I'd buy again.  Was interesting to try once though.  Between this and their Balcones 1, I'd go with the latter.  Given this is about $80, it's pricey...but you really don't have this flavor profile elsewhere."

Under the nose to the first sip and through the finish, this just walks me through a classic Texas BBQ.  Smoked brisket, warm peach cobbler. Roasted corn, and a big pot of beans.  It's all in there.  You can smell the burning embers of the corn husks.  While it may not be for everybody, if you are searching for West Texas in a bottle, this is it.  A very well executed, unique whiskey.  For those looking for adventure, this is it."

Finally found a couple of bottles in Austin and bought them to round out my Balcones collection.  I have read several tasting notes on this iconic Texas whiskey and I both agree and disagree with the herd. The smoke does present in the nose, but not not before a strong statement of vanilla, brown sugar and black licorice . On the tip of the tongue its sweet. Sugar, vanilla, and licorice again Smoke is more present and a salty brine as it rolls to the middle of the tongue. The smoke comes to the forefront on the finish with sweet slightly burnt corn. After five minutes or so just trying to contemplate what I had just expierienced i realize that the licorice has never left, asking me to take another sip so that it may be balanced again."

3.0,Wow barbecue ribs on the nose and then straight on the palate. It's like someone poured liquid barbecue smoke mixture into the batch. Never really had a flavour like that. I wouldn't say its a complex dram as that's as far as it goes really and slightly on the artificial side like the rest of the balcones range. The more I get into it the more I realise its a one trick pony and I couldn't consume to much of this at all. It's a hard one to pick I'd say 3 for overall appeal but 4 for novelty value. 3.5 it is.

The smoke was at the forefront of everything. The second bottle which I have had about half of is not quite as smokey and it bites more than the first bottle did. Still enjoyable but the novelty of the dense smoke flavor is not as prevalent.

After all, peated scotch is only so because that was the fuel they had for their fires, just like mesquite or scrub oak here in Texas. The nose is exquisite, with notes of chili, BBQ, honey glaze, and lots of lovely smoke. The taste complements it nicely with a roundness and a slight dustiness from the corn, and the finish has the perfect amount of smoke and burn and lasts forever like the dying embers of a campfire. When my bottle of Balcones Single Malt runs dry, I'm replacing it with this!"

2.0,"Enjoying neat from a freshly opened bottle. The nose is reminiscent of sweet BBQ. The palette is a mix of sweet and savory. The corn sweetness comes through in spades as does the smoke. The alcohol is not as noticeable as the 106 proof may lead one to believe. Continued sipping gains some rough edges, not sure if acclimating to the sweetness or if the proof is building on the palette. This is not a subtle dram but I am enjoying it very much. Note that 30-45 minutes after my drink I was still exhaling the smoke (like after sitting around a smoky fire but delicious and enjoyable). It also made the sub sandwich I had taste like it was smoked. 
Went back to this dram the next day and the smokiness was still there but was either subdued or hiding behind the rough and sharp notes that made me think young whiskey (the age statement on my bottle  is aged at least one day in oak).
Came back to this about a week after opening and I do not like. The delicious savory BBQ are gone and young whiskey notes are dominate. Tried opening the whiskey with water and it emphasizes the sweetness on the nose and dulled the sharp edges on the palette but did not bring the savory deliciousness back. 
I am sad as it was so good when first opened."

The scent of burnt wood and bonfire overwhelmed the nose. After some time to acclimate, I began to smell sweet buttery corn and honey. It’s quite interesting. 
The taste was a LOT of char and wood. It’s also very dry. Like a bonfire in your mouth. But once I got a few sips in I started to taste nuttiness, spice, and some salt . On the finish, you’re left with char. BUT after I left the bar, I started to taste sweet corn again.

I’ve never had a whiskey jump back and forth between smokey/spicy to sweet as I was tasting it. It’s very unique. 

I’ll admit I didn’t love this at first, but I do find it fascinating. I’ll have to taste this again to see if I’d be willing to invest in a bottle."

2.5,Super smokie
4.25,"I bought a bottle of Brimstone last November, and it's still 2/3 full.  It's not that I don't love it; it's a truly unique and distinctive dram. Like anchovies or vindaloo, I'm not often in the mood for it, but when I am, it's a craving.  


The phrase ""bold Balcones"" is entirely redundant, and of the Balcones that I've tried, this is the boldest of the bold.  It's smoke and barbeque sauce and some sage thrown in for good measure, with custard on the finish.   What impresses me most is that it doesn't taste particularly young, even though it probably is, and there's certainly no ethanol harshness (particularly notable at 53% ABV)  The working theory seems to be that the Texas climate dramatically accelerates the aging process.   

This is a highly polarizing whiskey, but it absolutely works for me."
3.75,On ice is a must to round it out

3.75,"Paired with the Peanut Butter Bacon Burger and complimented it just fine. 

I think there is taste of some dark fruits to go along with the smoky goodness."
