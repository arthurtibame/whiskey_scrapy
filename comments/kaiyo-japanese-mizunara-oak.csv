5.0,"The mizunara oak provides a light sweet tasting wood note to this exceptional malt whisky with honey and floral on the nose. Incredibly light and smooth, it rivals the Fukamo rice whisky for finish and texture. Outstanding!"

3.5,Nose is like straight isopropyl. Fuzzy on the palate.
4.25,"It’s been a little while since I’ve opened a bottle of Japanese whiskey and I’ve had this bottle along with it’s sister companion- the cask strength version, for almost 6 months.  I found these online stateside out of Pennsylvania for $54 (and $84 for the CS version).

This NAS Japanese whiskey is relatively new to the scene, but it has been caught up with the Asian whisky craze that’s sweeping the whisky world.  This stuff disappeared from shelves just as quickly as I had found it.  I knew I should’ve bought 2 of each but I wasn’t sure of the Kaiyo name at the time.  Boy, I wish I would’ve just went ahead and grabbed another pair.  These are both fantastic whiskies.

This pours shiny, new gold in the taster.  It’s very oily and produces sparse, thin legs and watery drops when you give it a spin.

The nose is hay and dried oak at first sniff, but given 10-15 minutes it opens up beautifully with tons of tropical fruits and light floral notes.  The nose did suffer over a few weeks with oxidation- most of the sweetness went away and I was left with mostly banana bread and light spice.

The palate really showcased the Miz oak- honey, berries, fresh cut cantaloupe melon.  Nutmeg and cinnamon came across mid way through the sip and there was some youthful zip and light black pepper at the tail end.  The ABV cut into the sweetness and kind of struck an unbalanced cord into the entire flavor profile.  It didn’t ruin it, but it did kill the sweetness a bit too early IMO.

The finish capitalized on the spicy aspect:  cinnamon heat and black pepper led the charge and it was slightly harsh, warm and drying before leaving a slightly nutty aftertaste lingering on.  The length was medium and the dryness closed things out quite well.

Overall, this reminded me of Yamazaki a little bit (the tropical fruits and overall juiciness) and made me wish I had my bottle of Yama 18 open so I could really confirm the similarities I had swirling in my head.  The harshness and youthful aspect can’t hold a candle to the Yamazaki, obviously- but this was a great value for your dollar at less than $55 and the cask strength was even better (review coming soon).  If you can find this on shelves without the insane Japanese whiskey mark-up I highly recommend it.  4 stars all day long, and maybe a .25 star bump for the price point.  Cheers, my friends."

3.75,"I can sit and smell this all day.  The mizunara aroma permeates like a garden full of jasmine.  Highly floral, incense like.  The nose alone is a 5 out of 5.  The palette is a few notches down though, unfortunately doesn’t live up to the nose.  The jasmine garden becomes more waxy, honeycomb and shortbread biscuits.  

I can see why Mizunara is generally more expensive than sherry or ex-bourbon.  It’s highly porous, making it quite difficult to work with as compared to the others.  But the aroma it imparts...just amazing.  Thanks to @LeeEvolved for this generous pour"

4.0,"I was drawn in by the background on this whiskey with it being both aged in Mizunara oak and like the Jefferson’s ocean aged partially at sea. I don’t get the ocean in the nose yet like some have said, but the nose is very complex. 

At first taste it seemed as though an Irish has been mixed with some kind of bourbon. I got a lot of the sweet notes you would get from an Irish but with a lot more barrel than you’d typically get. I assume at least one of the casks used must be first fill. 

I kept drinking this throughout the night and at several points I could have sworn up and down that it was prayed, however I did not get the peated version. I’ve found after you let the glass sit for a bit and some of the alcohol evaporates it offers much different notes. More friendly but less complex. At one point I found the scent of my girlfriends basement in it and could not stop smelling it.

Very good whiskey with a decent bit of complexity. If you like scotch blends and Japanese whiskey it won’t disappoint you. It isn’t as profound as a lot of it’s more expensive and well known Japanese counterparts but I think it’s worth the price, and definitely worth a try."

3.75,"It’s been a while since my last review of a Japanese whisky, so I figured its about time to get another one out there. This sample came by way of @LeeEvolved. Kaiyō Japanese Mizunara Oak is a blended malt. It is first aged in a warehouse for an undisclosed amount of time, then, like Jefferson’s Ocean, it heads out to sea for a little R&R. 3 months to be exact. The motion of the ship and changes in temperature and pressure supposedly help to age the whisky at a more accelerated rate...whatever. This malt blend is bottled at 43% ABV and is non chill filtered but most likely has colorant added making it a honey gold. 

The Mizunara oak jumps out immediately on the nose along with strong floral notes of jasmine, orange and cherry blossoms. Vanilla, salty with what I can only describe as clam juice. After some time there is a bit of lemon citrus, more oak, walnuts and banana bread. Candied pineapple and ginger, ginseng. Oranges, tangerines, honey and a bit malty. A nice nosing whisky with a few curveballs. 

The palate has strong vanilla and floral notes with some honey and oak. Ginseng, ginger, oranges and tangerines. Peppery, a touch astringent. Anise, cinnamon and candle wax. The waxy notes really become front and center once you pinpoint them. Underripe cantaloupe, slightly salty but also a syrupy sweetness. Not as good as the nose, but still good. 

A light to medium bodied mouthfeel that is lightly oily and somewhat waxy. 
The finish is medium long, waxy, peppery, oak and vanilla. 

This whisky really showcases what Mizunara oak can do. I’m not a huge fan of Mizunara compared to American oak, but this one was well done. The profile immediately brought me back to Johnny Smoking Gun from Two James Spirits in Detroit. They are very similar, but this was far superior. I’m somewhere between a 3.5 and 3.75, but based on the price of around $55 I’ll have to go with 3.75. 
Cheers"

Brief store sampling.  My first taste of Mizunara-aged spirit.

Very thin on the palate.  Subtle flavors that take time to blossom.  Recognizably different than most whiskies.  Gentle sweetness.  Tart and tangy lemon peel.  Sandalwood. Unusual florals... say orchids.  A hint of pleasant bitterness.  Intriguing and tasty, but the flavors are fleeting and ultimately unsatisfying.  I want more (I reference you to my cask strength review)."

3.5,"Color is a gold. Nose starts with a grassy, oily phase, followed by hints of honey and vanilla. First sip starts with a little mellow spice and smokiness, but not peat, more just a whiff of passing fire pit. This transitions to a subtle vanilla and honey middle, with a smooth mouthfeel, with faint notes of fruit. Finish is a return of the gentle spice, though only for a short time. Punches above its proof, but the finish could be longer. Overall, good, but not worth the price tag"

4.0,"I’ve been making a concerted effort to try more Japanese whisky. This makes for my 4th review, and the first I’ve done of a spirit aged in Mizunara Oak. I know these guys source, but unlike many, they source from within Japan, as opposed to Scotland.

Nose: Sandalwood, saltwater taffy, bubblegum. Apple, orange, pear, banana, and vanilla. Coconut. Cucumber as well. Sort of a ginger ale note. Very sweet. Oak as well, but markedly different from what I’m used to. It’s lighter, more subtle.

Palate: Very floral. Still getting the cucumber. Vanilla, toffee, and malt. Shortbread cookie that reminds me of an Irish. Big time bubblegum, Macadamia nut. Some caramel in the background. The apple, pear, and banana carry over. Green bell pepper on the mid-palate. Once again, green, grassy, and floral. Subtle oak. Delicious.

Finish: Bell pepper and malty notes carry over from the palate. Plenty of spice. Clove, nutmeg, cinnamon. Definitely the spiciest part of the experience, maybe even a bit hot. Moderate-long finish.

Solid value here. Continually impressed with the Japanese product. Doesn’t boast the powerhouses that Scotch offers, but the few I’ve reviewed so far have been able to keep the pace of mid-level Scotch expressions. What Japanese whisky lacks in age, it makes up for in uniqueness and complexity. This is a fine example of both.

4/5 for this. Looking forward to trying more Mizunara Oak expressions because I think that’s a large part of the appeal here. It’s a step outside the boundaries for whisky as I’ve known it, and I like what I’ve discovered. If you’re looking to get into Japanese whisky, this should be one of the first few you try. Great representative."
3.5,My favorite Japanese so far. Almost oily buttery on the pallet with a feel similar to a lightly peated scotch. Tastes of butterscotch on the tongue. Good feel and taste. Lingering medium heat that’s heavier than a good scotch but still very enjoyable. Thanks Steve for sharing. I’d buy a pour of this one.
