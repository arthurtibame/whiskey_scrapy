4.0,Classic Rye spice with light dill signature of MGP products. Great everyday sipper
4.25,Nutty with hints of caramel. A slightly floral finish. Not as much spice as some other ryes but very smooth.
3.75,Bottled in Lawrenceburg

4.0,Yes! Good spice that stays. Light clean vanilla that lingers. Good for sipping straight. Will want to try a dram in a Christmas beverage or two.
3.0,"N: Faint caramel
P: Vanilla and spice all the way through
F: Medium length with a nice char"
4.5,"An absolutely delicious expression from the good folks at MGP. This packs a well rounded dram of spice, vanilla & barrel char and though it surely can do it all - I reserve it for neat pours."
4.5,"Minty, smooth, mildly sweet"
4.0,"OHLQ - 100 proof 

Nose: Sweet Carmel
Taste: Smoky & Spicy 
Finish: Clean"
2.5,"Had a hard time smelling anything... maybe just the bottle?
Taste :  pepper up front - vanilla middle - slight linger - just not much here go to the barrel proof"
3.75,This is a solid rye.  It’s sweet and a little spicy. I bet it is great barrel strength.  Nose has typical rye notes that coincides with an in the picket rye.  Good buy.

4.0,"Smooth.  Lacks heat.  Good, solid juice.  Can drink neat.  Great for mixing (e.g. Manhattans).  Not outstanding on it’s own, but solid."

4.5,"Barrel select: spice-28999, 50% abv 
Nose: it actually smells pretty sweet for a rye. 
I’ve had the barrel strength of this rye and thought that was pretty smooth. This goes down easy as well. There’s a great lingering chest warmth as well. 
Lots of sweet caramel and late licorice. The rye is robust but the heat is well managed. Very happy with this purchase."
3.75,Excellent rye. Sweet oak honey and spice. Nice long finish.

4.0,"Almost impossible to find in my area, scoring the only bottle of this at a random little mom and pop liquor store was quite the coup. Let’s dive in:

Nose of fresh cut grass, ginger, herbs, eucalyptus, dill, honey Graham cracker, pepper, and buttered biscuit.

Palate features honey, mint, white pepper, and what I would call “cooking spices”, meaning thyme, basil, sage, and rosemary. Make no mistake this sucker is no 51% “Kentucky Rye”; herbaceous to the core without straying into medicine territory (no small feat) Flavors pop to the point that this one punches above its weight class. 

Finish is a surprisingly long blast of hot rye spice and cinnamon, morphing into cooling menthol. Mouthfeel is grainy. 

Being a fan of herbal ryes this one hit the right notes for me. Nothing that moves the earth here, just really good MGP 95/5 rye. You can tell that MGP saved some of the best stuff for themselves, as this is easily distinguishable from the ubiquitous expressions that flood the market under different labels. At $42, it’s a win and a rebuy."
