1.0,"As much as I want to like this because it's a local micro, it's just too young and too harsh. There's some decent character so maybe in years to come with extra barrel aging it will mature into a fine bourbon. For now not worth the price."

3.0,Agree that it doesn't have much depth but with a chew it has a good flavor. Kinda like the young taste.  All in all not really worth the price. Tastes like $30.
2.0,"Got to sample this bourbon, notes of spices, vanilla, sweet and a heat that rises up to my nose and maybe a little smoke. Certainly doesn't have the smoothness associated with an age statement. Grows on me the more I drink of it. I'm certainly glad I got to try it but needless to say I won't be buying a bottle"

2.0,"Hard to fault ambition - but this is not good a good advert for bourbon. Bottle opening-no overpowering traces other than you can smell the alcohol. Taste- very thin, artificial and a vague after taste of metal.One star for effort. One star for the packaging. It's hard to think of a  seemingly more calculated effort to make something artisan. Dissappointing."

1.0,"i really wanted to like this one.  especially at its 55.00 price point. they use a really pretty and expensive looking bottle that makes you think you are getting your money's worth.  unfortunately, i have to say the flavor profile is very flat and lacks any semblance of complexity.  it tastes like a cheap 1 year old bourbon or perhaps a vodka with some interesting notes.  it would be a steal at 12.00/bottle.  i wish i could say i liked it.  this just seems like a company jumping on bourbon band wagon with no intention of producing a good product.  in summary, this product is overpriced crap.  pretty bottle, high price point, cheap product.  don't waste your money. if you wan't something from outside of Kentucky that has value,  go buy a bottle of Widow Jane instead.  They should be shot for this desecration of the spirit variety.   there are lots of brands of bourbon in this price point that have value.  this one.....does not."

2.0,"A lot of great things come out of the state of Illinois.... wait no they don't and whiskey is no exception. I've had two whiskeys from Illinois in the past week and all I can say is blah. The nose was the best part with oak vanilla citrus cedar spearmint and nutmeg. Wood spice at the forefront and flavors hard to pick out. Very thin and unflavorful if you just drink it, you literally have to chew on it. After that you get the floral/ citrusy notes as well as some cinnamon and apple like flavors. Lightly smoky/ charred flavor and maybe some dark honey with a little mintiness but its all hard to pick out and very bland. Finish is longish smoky sweet alcohol and more oak"

4.0,"Deep amber iced tea color in the glass with long sticky legs. 
Nose: not overly sweet or vanilla-like. Spicy, with lots of woody oak and some char. 
Palate: moderately sweet and savory, with some candy corn and vegetal notes both in the background, sparring for attention amidst the oaky and somewhat earthy notes. 
Finish:  moderately long with pleasing heat, commensurate with its ABV. 
Nice dram overall. I’d give it a good B+.  For those critical of bourbon for being too sweet, this is a balanced, savory dram that doesn’t overwhelm with sweetness."
