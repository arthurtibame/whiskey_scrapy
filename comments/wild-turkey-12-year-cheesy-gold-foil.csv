5.0,"I don’t drink much bourbon and wouldn’t know a Wild Turkey if it bit me on the ass, but this legendary bottling from the 1980s is wonderful. There’s a narrow set of flavors that I like in bourbon along with several that I don’t and this one hits the bullseye. The nose is a glorious mix of cherry and polished rosewood. There’s a brief and bonkers hit of funky cheese grits on the first sip and then a seamless segue into brown sugar and cinnamon that lingers for hours. I was reveling in the aftertaste of this until bedtime. And as I mentioned, it’s all the better for what it doesn’t taste of: no corn, cream, vanilla or white sugar. This is as good as any Pappy I’ve had and delivers as much flavor as a WL Weller at a far more palatable proof. I don’t think I could ever declare a Scotch perfect given how complex the category is, but in the narrow spectrum of flavors that define bourbon this is as good as it gets."

5.0,"One of the best bourbons ever is the Wild Turkey 12 Year, which was produced from the mid 80’s until the early 90’s, mainly for the Japanese market.  It is a stunning whiskey with an incredible oily mouthfeel and the longest finish.  It is in perfect balance."
