3.25,A mild scotch that’s very fruit forward and a short finish. Enjoyable but not gonna be high on my list
4.0,"This was actually the 12 year single malt

Colour - gold, amber, rich look
Nose - fruity, fresh, medicines
1st - rising heat, soft, light finish, citrus notes after a few minutes
2nd - more heat, shorter finish
3rd - flavours improved, more spices"

3.0,Not the best bottle of scotch but it's nice just to pour when with a group of people. Not a bad price either. A cube or drop of ice mellows the fire.

2.0,"Not NEARLY as good as the three wood, this one was a bit of a disappointment. Fruity, smooth, sweet (vanilla-y,) but there's really not much to it. It left me wanting, not satisfied."

5.0,"Perfect for the begginer Scotch drinker. Typical Lowland lady, smooth as can be."
4.0,This is way better than the 2.9 average it's showing now. I definitely picked up on vanilla and honey notes. Definitely a smooth glass. Try it!

3.0,"Nose: vanilla and coconut (as expected),peach, bit of hazelnut. Taste: sweet, pear, bit of white chocolate. Aftertaste: bittersweet, warm but short. Overall: nice easy-drinker single malt. Nothing outstanding, but pays for the price."
