4.5,"Winter solstice in Norway: the perfect time to pop the cork of this 16-year-old Highland Park, distilled in 2001 and matured in sherry butt #651 (58.8% ABV, 588 bottles). What a marvelous color! Is this the blood of Odin? Dried fruits, roasted coffee and whiffs of peat smoke reach the nose, and there are hints of cloves, Jamón serrano and leather. The taste is intense, sweet and mildly peaty with dark chocolate, mint and a dash of salt. Cocoa, licorice and oak spices migrate into the warming and substantial finish. A great Single Malt for long and cold nights!
