4.0,"Of these three Whiskey Makers Series, I enjoyed the Blender's Dog the best. Layered and interesting."

4.0,"The second of the three Whiskey Makers Series bottlings to be released stateside, this one could only be a bit of a letdown after the sheer beauty of its predecessor, The Cooper's Croze. While that one was nearly a five star whiskey for me, this is a solid four. Now, that's hardly a bad thing - 4/5 ain't bad. But...it lacks the dynamism and ""wow!"" factor of Cooper's Croze. Gone is the playful, exuberant interplay between the various wood influences; now, the blender is the focus, and this blender is a bit more keen on making...well, a blended Irish whiskey. It's most certainly a *good* Irish blend, with a high percentage of pure pot still lending a rich, spicy fruitiness to the dram, but it loses some of the distinctiveness of its predecessor bottling in the series. If you were to set up a blind tasting with this and a few other pot still heavy blends, I don't know that I would be able to pick this out immediately. It is  a worthy dram on its own, rich and fruity with a lovely touch of spice and vanilla, but for the price, I'd hope for a little more sparkle."

3.0,Jameson Blenders Dog is the second release in the distillers series. This is not as successful of an attempt. The typical flavors of a good irish single pot still are present but an unexpected bitterness on the back end. detracts. Still a proper Irish Whisky but not the best showing.

3.0,"Wonderful classic Irish nose - honey, cream, butterscotch, citrus, floral. Surprising tang initially, but very creamy. Sweet, smooth, shortbread, balanced with zest and bitterness on the end. Pleasant. 7/3/18"

4.0,Lovely vanilla smooth lingering taste. Little spice at the end. Not much aroma.  Makes you look forward to the next sip.   Not one for mixing with anything.  Distinctly top shelf .

3.75,"Smooth and very easy drinking. Nice flavor profile of fruity/sweet. Not much of a challenge here- but frankly sometimes a clean, refreshing whiskey that gets down easy it just what you want.  It doesn’t happen all that often for me, but when I’m in that frame of mind, this will fit the bill.  I’m glad to have received it as a gift - it will fill a niche in my whiskey cabinet that was missing."

3.5,Very complex flavors that starts with a spicy heat and calms to an oat and sweetness that morphs with the light wood and smoke flavors before a fairly light linger returns to the heat.
3.25,Spicy and sweet. Not too harsh

4.0,Light-bodied yet full flavored.  Gentle but not delicate.  This is a smooth whiskey.  Distinctly higher amounts of single pot still detectable but still has a decent malt backbone.  Definitely worth trying.
