4.0,"It's enough interesting single malt. On nose and on mouth it has different tastes. On nose it has very faint peat aroma, there's more dried fruits. In mouth at first opening  a lot of peated notes, burnt charcoal, some bitter notes like a licorice marmalade and pepper. Aftertaste isn't short and not so long but, it's enough to feel developing of the taste in your mouth there're sweet, honey and dried fruits. So it's a very good peated whisky with itself character"

5.0,"Ladies and Gentlemen, i have finally drank whisky. 

If you haven't had Ardmore Traditional Cask, you haven't drink whisky in your life. It is one of the most exciting, fullfilling, marvelous and rewarding experiences i have ever had in a whisky.

Kept away for a long time in my bar, since it didn't called my attention, i read Paul's review yesterday and decided to give it a try. I am glad i did. So far this is the top whisky in 2017 for me and it is a perfect 10. 

On the nose, Peat. peat peat peat peat. perfumed peat. Islay Peat (although it is a highland single malt), that kind of peat, resembling a Talisker maybe.

Also on the nose: slight notes of almonds, medicinal plants, toffee, and something metallic that smells just like my gold wedding ring. Bottled at 46%abv with a polished mahogany color, non chill filtered.

If it was wonderful on the nose, you can't even imagine it on the palate. Full bodied, Thick, starts with caramel, to rapidly change into a Spicy bomb, gentle hotness, Spicy wood, all spices on earth, spices mixed with angels, spices to the heart.

Bonfire, peat and clove. All that wrapped up in spices. The finish is long and mouth watering, with peat and hotness. Simply amazing. Made my friday, exactly what you expect to leave behind a hard working week. It is so good i have already text every friend i have to find this bottle and buy it. I had the dram 10 minutes ago and my mouth still tastes ashes. BEAUTIFUL PERFECT DRAM, HISTORY HAS BEEN MADE HERE. SLAINTE!"
4.0,"Bottled 2008.  

Here’s a bottle from back when NAS bottlings had something to prove, and there were many examples that provided excellent value for money.  That was during the time of the industry’s hook.  We are now in the time of the line and sinker.

Ardmore does not have a fan base of collectors, so the Traditional Cask can still be found gathering dust on a few shelves.  Don’t confuse this with their current release, Ardmore Tradition, which is trash.  This Ardmore is like a less maritime, fruitier Talisker 10.  Fruity liquorice, honey, dark chocolate, and a unique smokiness that does not exist in today’s NAS releases.  The smoke is haunting – soft and delicate, but mouthcoating with honey and barbequed meats.

What I don’t like is the sulfur fire from the sherry casks they used.  But, this is nonetheless a very good whisky for the price, and I am replacing this bottle if I can find it again.

Score: * (unforgettably good) 
How much does a bottle cost: $35-60 (discontinued)
How much do I think a bottle is worth: $60"

4.0,a young peaty scotch that is a great intro to smoky peaty genre like Laphroig 10 w/o breaking the bank.
5.0,"The peatiness of Laphroaig, but much smoother. 9.5/10."

2.0,"Nose has a fine light peat itself. Not complex. Taste is not too overbearing, but tough. It's not as characteristic such as a Springbank, where it should taste like according to the guy in the liquor store. Delicious with a 3 year ripened cheese.
Aftertaste a bit like chamomile or mint stars."
