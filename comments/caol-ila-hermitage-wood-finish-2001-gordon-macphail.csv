5.0,"This is an interesting scotch, and not something I expected to find in a Caol Ila product.  This independent bottling comes from Gordon & Macphail, one of the oldest and most experienced groups sourcing and releasing single casks of whiskey.  What's unusual about this one is that its unique red-wine finishing transforms its Caol Ila base into something that's much more like Ardbeg or Laphroaig.  There's more peat than smoke on first whiff, and sherry or wine accents, with more savory, meaty scents of buttered biscuits and prosciutto rising up over time.  The palate reminds me of a sherry-finished Ardbeg or Laphroaig, like Ardbeg Dark Cove in particular.  There's a medicinal edge to its smoke, but is complemented by a chimeric set of flavors that remind me of a sweet and salty honeyed ham.  The finish is fiery smoke at first, but then it builds up to sweeter flavors of honey.  This bottle probably would set you back by $100 or more, although it's not available anymore, so perhaps we don't have to worry about the price all that much.  If you find it in a bar, ask for a pour and you won't regret it!"
