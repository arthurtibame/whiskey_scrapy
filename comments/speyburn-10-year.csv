3.75,"Nose is Sherry cask stuff: tannins and cherrywood. The nose is very much barrel-wood forward. The vanilla, buttery shortbread and salt play the back row. The burn is mild.

Taste is mild tobacco ash, and metallic like pennies. Finished oak and bitter plum and prune. With a little water the flavors smooth out: the shortbread and salt pop, and toasted coconut stops by.

The finish is more sherry barrels; perfume kissed off of your best girl's neck. Suntan lotion and a mild nuttiness. Tobacco leaf sits in the back of the tongue like a recently-puffed cigar. 

Speyburn 10 is a Scotch that's both mild and complex, challenging and yet highly sippable. It rewards you when you sit with it a spell."

2.0,"Nose: Very clean scents – sweet and fruity with minty notes.

Taste: Not as light as fruity whiskys usually tend to be. Medium and dry body, with lemon dominating and soft hints of smoke on the background.

Finish: Bitterness takes over while the fruits fade away very fast.

Balance: Not a light one, which is usually a plus for me. But too dry for my taste. Or should I say too dry and fruity for me."

3.0,"Cereal, honey, butterscotch and vanilla nose with a fruity, floral aroma all greet the nose.  Arrives on the palate, creamy, with orange peel, tea, honey and vanilla notes.  Flavors fade leaving the palate with orange zest, a small amount white pepper and burn (43% ABV).  Leaves a slightly bitter palate on the finish.  As it opens in the glass, it becomes sweeter and a bit softer.  A bit of water opens the floral notes and tames the burn. This is a one to keep around for sharing.  Young (of course), simple and bright. A good scotch at even a better price. [$29][84/100][Opened: 8/1/2014][Revisited: 5/21/15;12/23/15]"

3.0,Primary reason for buying a $25 single malt is because I plan on smuggling it on a cruise in a listerene bottle. I didn't want to risk having a nice scotch confiscated if I get busted. I will take my cheap scotch over paying for $10 beers.  This cheap single malt was much better than the Bradan Orach though.

3.0,"Speyburn 10, a 10 year old speyside single malt scotch whisky from Speyburn distillery. Price : $32.99, Sampled on 3/3/15 with 1/2 teaspoon of water in a Glencairn spirits nosing glass.

Aroma - Heavy prune and raisin, sharp alcohol nip, vanilla, light marzipan, perhaps some fleeting cilantro here, brown sugar and pineapple. 

Taste - Vanilla, fruit, fleeting cilantro again, woodsap, extremely light medicinal smoke.

Finishes with a medium lingering flavor and long lingering burn. 

Final score : 3.5 / 5, You aren't going to find a cheaper single malt, and what you're getting is a decently high quality spirit when you account for the price you've paid. Work equally as well as a mixer for those rare cocktails that call for single malt scotch. Wouldn't necessarily purchase again, but is worth adding under your belt."

3.0,"Picked this guy up last weekend as I continue searching for the best $30 and under drams.

Nose: Typical Speyside profile, Apples, Honey, Citrus, Nutty (Hazelnut?)

Taste: Honey, Toffee, Oak, Very sweet, buttery and velvety mouthfeel. Minimal alcohol burn. Quite enjoyable

Finish: Some spice notes, not very long and a bit bland. Subtle smoke.

Very easy to drink and I paid for it the next morning with a mild hangover but nothing beats it at this price point so far. A solid replacement for Glenlivet 12 and Glenmorangie 10. I think Old Pulteney 12 and Acnoc 12 are superior but those will be in the $40+ range. This is a sleeper."

3.0,"I added a 50ml sample of this Speyburn to my latest online order because I remembered the Bradan Orach bottle I bought back near the beginning of my scotch hobby.  The Orach was $19 and I couldn't believe how smooth and relatively flavorful it was.  Let's see if the 10 year is as surprising as the BO was...

This offering is a light, golden color and almost immediately I get a nice, floral nose with a hint of sweet vanilla.  There's almost no oak or heat detected.  On the tongue, the spicy oak takes over pretty quickly and dominates the entire sip.  It makes the entire experience rather one dimensional but, taking age and price point into account, this is expected and not really unwarranted.  It's interesting enough to enjoy neat but I can't help but feel this one would work very well mixed with your sugary soda of choice.

I've seen this bottle locally for less than $30 and I would have to recommend it over a lot of blended whiskies near that same price point.  It's actually been pretty cool reviewing this one neat and when it comes time to replace a cheap bottle in my bar I'd be foolish to not consider this one for that purpose.  Give it a try if you're searching for a well whisky for mixing or for friends you know wouldn't appreciate that $60+ scotch that you'd rather save for yourself.  Cheers."

4.0,"I thought I would give this $30 USD bottle a go. It's definitely a good value. 

In the glass, it's a goldenrod hue, maybe a little too deep to be natural. Not much in the way of legs on the glass when swirled. 

Nose:  Quite fruity, with notes of apple juice and peaches. The faintest hint of dried/candied fruits makes its way in. 

Palate: Sweet with a little peppery heat throughout. There's a dash of vanilla, much as you'd smell in vanilla infused pipe tobacco, and it comes in with a tiny splash of citrus. 

Finishes with a pleasant tannin bitterness. The dry glass smells like trail mix and pipe tobacco. 

This would be a good transition Scotch for bourbon drinkers, and a good introductory single malt in general. I agree with others that it isn't particularly challenging, but given it's price, it's age, and that it is non-peated, I wouldn't expect it to be. 

In all, it's a solid single malt and a good value at $30. I give it 83 points and 4 stars."

Pretty darn good for the price. The nose is distinctly citrus. The sip is a little sweet and very soft, but the finish seems to be all burn, and it lingers for quite a while. Maybe this is expected at 86 proof at this price, but then again I can’t think of another 10-year single malt at this price. Does $30-ish buy a better blend? Probably. Does it buy a better single malt? I doubt it.

I’ll have to try it with an ice cube."

On the Nose:  Sweet, cereal and vanilla. This isn't terribly complex, but you don't expect it to be either. 

Taste:  Arrives sweet and with that cereal note again. Think ""Whisky Corn Flakes"" and you're on the right path. 
Short development and a syrupy fruit and vanilla note to finish.

I think a few years ago, I would've loved this.  But my palette has been forever ruined by an assault on senses from the likes of Lagavulin, Laphroaig, and Ardbegs...so personally I found this bland.

3.0,"Stop number 25 on the SDT is Speyburn. This Highland distillery is by and large sold as a blending component, but has a handful of expressions sold as single malts. This 10 year old is their youngest that carries an age statement. 43% ABV and most likely chill filtered. If there is colorant added it would be minimal as it is a yellow gold color and it lacks the telltale fake orange glow most colored scotches have. 

The nose starts out with light citrus notes of lemongrass and lime leaves, shifting to underripe apples and pears. A fair amount of vanilla and some noticeable bourbon qualities. Noticeable, but not intense. Light brown sugar and sherry notes like raisins and dates. Floral honey and melon and a bit of candied pineapple. I also got the strange sensation of lightly salted, unbuttered popcorn. Unexpected, but very interesting. It's got some complexity to the nose, but it's not overly appealing and kind of boring. 

The palate has lots of vanilla and honey and a malty character. Bourbon notes more than sherry, but still there is some sherry making itself known. Apples, pears, cinnamon, allspice and light oak. Light peppery spice.  Possibly some mango and pineapple. This is one of those rare occasions where, for me anyway, the palate delivers beyond what the nose indicates. Like the nose though, it's nothing to get too excited about. 

The mouthfeel is light bodied, thin but somewhat oily and mouthwatering. 
The finish is surprisingly long. Honey and vanilla with some oak and spice. 

This is a typical Highland/Speyside malt, but more subdued on the nose.  The palate is nice though.  Probably a mix between first and second fill casks. It's not something I would seek out, but for around $30 it's hard to question its value as a gift or as something to keep around for the casual scotch drinking friend who might stop by. I'd give it a 3 if it were more than $40, but for the price it gets a 3.25. Thanks to Scott for the sample. 
Cheers"

Obviously young, light and typical Speyside, the nose features honey, tinned fruits and mild spices with discreet floral notes in the background. Green apples, malty sweetness and hints of ginger please the palate, interrupted by refill cask bitterness and a little bit of heat in the development. The aromatic and rather short finish is easy and forgettable. Although not overly complex or inspiring, this malt still beats most blends.

Whiskey is fairly smooth although it does have a bit of that rubbing alcohol bite to it that makes you pucker from time to time. This doesn't ruin the whiskey but let's you know that quality wise there are better.  For around the same price you can get Tin Cup American whiskey which is much smoother.

3.0,"Nose is sweet and sugary, lemon drop.
Taste is light honey with not a lot of depth."
5.0,"Wow I found an age statement import for $22!
Nose: dark chocolate, spearmint, lemon zest. Pleasantly bitter.
Taste: Really drinkable, a bit of bite but an easily distinguishable grapefruit along with even, light Scotch flavors.
Finish is pleasant: black pepper and long, lingering dark chocolate.
I predict I’m going to buy more of this than any other Scotch."

2.5,"There is almost no smoke. Mostly a light, nectar sweet scotch. I would not get this again."
3.5,"750ml poured neat in Glencairn at home.  Nose has mild toffee, lemongrass, hint of banana.  Mild and pleasant.  Taste is more grain forward, with some leather and tobacco notes coming on, followed by a mildly spicy finish that does linger for a bit.  This a very approachable mild Speyside.  Already a value, I got it on sale for $26.99.  While nothing really special, it is definitely worth every penny I paid, and more. 9/5/19"

2.25,"A wonderful example of how age doesn't equal maturity. This is a strangely bourbonesque scotch. It has more of a bourbon quality to it than a scotch quality. That's not a good thing. Because you can get a better bottle of bourbon for less money. The alcohol is hot, the finish is harsh and spicy. The technical quality of this is lacking. It's disappointing -- and I'm giving plenty of credit to the low price. It's still not a very good value."
3.5,First Scotch I've purchased. Liked it more with an ice ball from my mold. A good entry point into the style.

4.0,If you can get this on sale there is super value for your dollar. Got th gift set on sale for 19.99 and it also came with source water which gives the whiskey a nice touch. Would definitely buy again as a whiskey lover on a budget.

4.0,"This scotch has a straw gold color with thin semi-viscous legs.

The nose is simple but enjoyable with notes of peat, sweet smoke, sea salt, peanuts, lemon, and Smarties candy.

The palate has a watery mouthfeel and is sweet with notes of salty peat, dry grass, caramel, green apple, and blackberry.

The finish is of medium length and has a sweet candy taste to it.

For being a budget friendly bottle, this scotch is really well rounded. It’s sweet, smokey, and really enjoyable. I approve! Thanks, Speyburn! Sláinte!"

3.5,"It’s that whisky you save for your father-in-law you don’t really like, but want to somewhat impress (assuming he doesn’t really know whisky). It’s a 10 year single malt, but it doesn’t bring anything special. Some floral and spice, certainly good enough to serve neat, but it seems to just sit there saying, “I’m scotch.”  Yes it is, but that about all."
3.0,"Speyburn 10 yr. has got to be about the cheapest single malt I have ever run into. At a mere $25 I couldn’t pass it up. Bottled at the minimum 40% ABV, this Speysider is matured in a combination of American oak ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks. It pours a bright gold in the glass and produces quick skinny legs when you give it a spin. 

The nose is very light and a bit dry. There’s a grassy hint of lemon zest, some light orchard fruits, and a bit of alcohol. A little underwhelming. 

In the mouth there’s light honey, citrus and orchard fruits that give way to a malty biscuit tone on the back end. Pretty simple but really not bad. There’s a slightly thick mouthfeel that develops after swallowing. Very drinkable with no alcohol at all. The finish is medium-short and has sweet malty cereal with just a whiff of tobacco. 

Overall this is a pretty decent malt, even more so considering the price. It can be found online at under $20 and even at $25 it’s a bargain. An easy drinker suitable for just about any purpose. 3/5. Cheers!"
