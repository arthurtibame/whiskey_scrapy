4.5,"Spicier than traditional Jack, very balanced, and retains the smoothness of traditional Jack."

4.0,"Even, balanced  and memorable - this ""limited"" edition is worth seeking out .  The 2014 holiday select is the most balanced JD single barrel iteration and as a consequence  the best. The standard single barrel is generally excellent, however it can suffer due to its cut proof. On the other hand the silver  select, is generally unbalanced. Sad there is no 2015 release and one day there will be no 2014 left !"
