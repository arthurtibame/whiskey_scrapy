3.0,"The port comes in a bit heavy. The Aroma is very sweet and heavy with a strong sugary profile that screams port; Palate has the same basic profile and comes through heavy, dark and sweet with only the oak to really balance it out; Finish is one raisin away from cloying."

4.5,"Very sweet nose followed up by a sweet pallet. After resting a bit the vanilla takes over.

High pepper finish that is medium long and ends dry."

3.0,"Tried a pour of this at a whiskey bar, which ended up running $44 for 2 ounces. I'm a big fan of high proof whiskey (Stagg Jr batch 12 is one of my favorites of 2019), but this one drank a little too hot for me, lacked much complexity and seemed a little flat, considering the price."

Dec. 31

I decided to end my new December mission with a new personal tradition: to crack open a limited yearly release at the end of its year. I’m thinking of this as one last “here’s to 2019,” to offer up one of the year’s finest (in theory) in celebration. I hope that one year from now I can still remember this is a thing.

This distillery has sentimental value to me. It was the first bourbon distillery I ever visited, with a good friend who was both far wiser about whiskey and far less well-endowed. While at Angel’s Envy, I got to physically bottle my own port finish. There was a big ceremony, I signed a book. It was a whole thing. I tried my first Old Fashioned in their upstairs bar. They called their version the Henderson, in honor of the family who started the business. I walked into Angel’s Envy “not a bourbon guy,” and left with a bit of that chip removed from my shoulder. That was July of 2018, and shortly thereafter, bourbon stole my soul. I still have no regrets.

The nose is deceptive. 61.2% should not be this easy to sniff. I enjoy this nose a bit better than standard AE and my current favorite port finish, Isaac Bowman. There’s cherry, grape, vanilla. It’s a predictable port finish nose, but it’s well done. It smells sweeter than it is dry, as in a well-made sangria. Very promising.

Body does not hide the ABV, but I don’t mind. Cherry is the hero here. I can’t remember a whiskey deliver such a pure cherry flavor before. I get vanilla too, and a bit of tart orange. It’s delicious.

Okay, the mouth feel on this finish is not going to be for everyone. My lips and gums feel like I’ve gotten a bunch of novocaine shots, and I’m only a handful of sips in. I actually enjoy it a lot, but it’s comically intense. Flavor transitions away from tartness and sweet fruit to vanilla, cinnamon, and a bit of leather. I can get dark chocolate too, but it’s less obvious.

With ice: anything this hot I like to try tempered down a skosh to see what changes. From start to finish, a bit of ice takes away a lot of the sweetness. Before I could’ve convinced myself that this was not a barrel finish, just a really unique bourbon. The sweetness reduction makes the port influence harder to argue with, but it’s still a delicious drink. Per usual, you lose some notes with the ice, but the cherry and vanilla persevere. I don’t understand how extra ABV and room temperature can make something seem sweeter, but I can’t argue with science.

This is a delicious bottle. $220 is steep, but for special occasions shared with friends, this bottle is worth it. There’s a lot to enjoy here. Will buy again if I can find.

This December experiment has been a lot of fun. If you happen to be hoarding bottles like I was, I highly recommend doing something like this every now and then. I now have dozens of delicious bottles opened up (so no pressure pouring a delicious dram from my collection) and I’ve learned a lot. For instance, it’s against Distiller guidelines to start a review request for a liqueur. I don’t fully understand this, as liqueurs are a selectable category in the drop down menu during review requests, but whatevs. I learned that Booker’s are for drinking, not hoarding. I learned that my love for bourbon is likely contingent upon the fact that I’m an American. I now view this love as less of an objective fact about reality and more a subjective statement about regional availability. Next year, I hope to earn my stripes in the world of scotch. 

I really want to thank everyone who interacted with my nonsense over the past month. You’ve made this experiment all the more fun. If you find yourself in the Chicago area, tag me I’m a post and let’s go find a place to drink some whiskey.

‘Tis the freakin season!"

3.0,"So the notes in here about it drinking a bit hot/harsh are spot on. I tend to like higher proof whiskeys as well, but this pour is a bit hot and unbalanced. Adding water mellows the heat, but overall it dilutes the character as well.

Nose of maple syrup (classic AE), pear, caramel, white pepper, and a hint of rye bread. First sip reveals a full sweet smooth entry of vanilla/caramel that immediately gets demolished by heat, medicinal/astringency, green pepper, that then fades to a nice cashew and char finish, that is long and warm."

4.5,"Very good. Pretty hot. Had to add a couple of drops of water. Full, rich notes of vanilla, oak, caramel, cinnamon, and spice. Port barrel is muted i think from the higher proof but still still a great dram nonetheless."

4.0,"A bit of sour fruit on the nose, some cacao nibs, an acidic character. But the nose is muted, a surprise. Initially smooth on the palate, velvety, great mouthfeel, then the spice quickly crescendos. Cinnamon, some sweet tea, rye notes. The cacao nibs show up again, with slight pecan bitterness. Spice really lingers. Warn Kentucky hug. This one's a beaut. 3/11/2020"
4.0,"Nose is vanilla, plums, fresh grains, and a touch of spice.

Taste is sweet raisins, light smoke, and vanilla.

Finish is nice and long, with no alcohol burn."

4.0,"I tasted this as a 2 oz pour neat in a glen cairn.  What immediately stuck out to me was the nose.  There is a sweet, cherry and oak marriage that is delightful.  The palate is on the sweeter side but not overwhelming.  There is an initial blast of heat and then a really nice berries and cream flavor followed by a butterscotch finish.  A dash of water releases some nutmeg and allspice and enhances the oak.  Nicely done.

Overall-  I was impressed.  That said $200 is a hefty price to pay.  I think that the nice wood box swallows up some of that.  I appreciated the fullness and the sweetness balanced by the spice.  Reminded me very much of some of the Barrel Proof Rye I enjoy-  Michters Barrel Proof immediately came to mind.  Price being a factor, it brings what would be a 4.5 for me down to a 4.0."
null,So lovely
