3.75,"I purchased this bottle following the distillery tour and sampling. According to the guide, the thing that makes this rye whiskey unique is that it's 100% malted Rye. It has a very soft mouth feel and a very Floral flavor.  This is a nice addition to my collection in that it's taste stands out from a number of the other younger Rye whiskeys that I've tasted. Hatch does clearly disclose that the whiskey is contract distilled from another Wisconsin distillery while they're homemade product is still aging."
