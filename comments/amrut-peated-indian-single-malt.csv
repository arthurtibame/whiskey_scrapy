4.0,Well peated but not overwhelming. Has  a spicy finish but this goes away with a bit of water. A great regular malt to add to the bar.

5.0,"Excellent - peated somewhere between Talisker and Lagavulin, and balanced with some great fruit forward flavors.  Can sort of tell its young but intensely matured.  For $60 I foresee this going into regular rotation."

3.0,"Mild smell of brine, dark wood,  pears and coriander. So different to the cask strengt sister. Have I been given a dud? Tastes well enough, nothing overwhelming. quite sweet with a bit of smoke on the end, few distinct flavours. sort of spicey and fruity, but they even out sadly. Mildly peaty finish."

4.0,"Fair amount of peat, honey and gentle trace of brine on the nose. The mouthful is robust yet balanced with oak spice, smoke and a hint of grapefruit rind on the palate. The finish is long, spicy and slightly rubbery. I'm quite impressed by this whisky."
4.0,"Amrut does not disappoint, and this is another whisky from their distillery I really enjoyed. There's a great deal of complexity here, coupled with maturity and depth - the peat is intense, yes, but it's never overwhelming to the detriment of other aromas: subtle barley, grapefruit rinds, some roasted almonds, and spices. The finish is herbaceous and long, quite long. I recommend."

4.25,"Bottle 1/3 full

One of the bests. Peat and butterscotch on the nose. Vanilla, smoke, oatmeal, cinnamon, roasted peanuts, ""Amrut green pepper"" and berries - in that order on the taste. Finish - glide off into the smoky sunset with medicine. 

Value: Received this as a Christmas gift from my wife, and was underwhelmed, it soon became a favorite. Really digging the dynamics of Indian whisky. The price tag reflects the juice inside, but would have second thoughts chasing it to the $85 range. Will definitely keep stocked in my cabinet, and am eager to share with friends.

P.S. as the bottle goes down, floral notes start to make themselves known and powers past the other flavors."
