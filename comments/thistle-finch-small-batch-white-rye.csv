3.0,"Very typical nose for a white rye, sweet and herbal cereal notes. The palate is soft for a rye. Green grass, herbs, and light spice on the back of the tongue. The finish is quick with spice. I found this light and wished the proof was over 90. Overall a promising rye. Can't wait to try the aged version."
