4.0,Did not know anything about this when purchased.  Nose had a earthy oaky aro a with the smell of ethanol.  The palate was not real hot but did have a smoke and vanilla flavor.  The finish is sustained with some heat and burn.

    I'm told by those in the know both these releases are better than the 2015 birthday bourbon. I tried it I like it it's rather inexpensive. And it certainly is a step up from their regular 90 or 100  proof versions"

5.0,"The best nose of my whiskey collection. After multiple tasting with friends, we had a resounding agreement that it smells just like bananna nut bread. Very viscous oily mouthfeel lets you know this bourbon means business. This is a love letter to your grandpas whiskey. The taste is that of a true old school bourbon. Leather, spice, oak, brown sugar, with a twinge of medicinal quality. Not in a negative way. It gives it an old tasting profile. I love this whiskey and everyone I've introduced it to loves it equally as much as I. Classic Brown-Forman whiskey."

4.0,"Next up on the Whiskey Row expedition: 1897 Bottled in Bond. Where the 1870 is fruity and light, the 1897 is dark and weighty. There's less of an overt corn note and more aged leather, dark brown sugar, and dulce de leche alongside clove, cinnamon, and oak. Smooth, sweet, and rich with just the right amount of funk to stay really interesting. Cheers to the Bottled In Bond Act!"

4.0,"Nose is disappointingly average.  It has typical aroma of caramel, vanilla and charred oak; not terribly distinct.  Darker color and moderate legs provide  hope for this bourbon.  It definitely tastes better than it smells.  Overall this bourbon is fairly sweet with some rye spice, and enough oak to moderate the blend of flavors.  The sweet flavors find elements of sulfured molasses, sorghum and singed caramel. Spices are present, but challenging to distinguish individual spice notes.  Black pepper, paprika, and a touch of chipotle powder are present but severely subdued by the sweetness of the bourbon and the bitterness of the oak.   Finish starts sweet, stays long and transitions to a wonderful oak bitterness.  Adding a touch of water did not substantially bring out hidden flavors.   This a hearty bourbon that is best to drink neat."

4.0,"Finally getting around to another review.  I've had this bottle for a couple of weeks now, but just getting around to giving it a formal tasting.  Right off the bat, this is a mighty fine bourbon!  The 1897 in the name is a nod to the year the bottled in bond act was passed.  As with all BIB whiskeys, this is the requisite 50% ABV and is at least 4 years old, although there is no age statement on the bottle.

In the glass this whiskey is a very nice dark amber color.  Swirling creates a thick oily coating that produces legs slowly.  The nose is wonderful, full of oak and caramel, with little to no burn.  There is some vanilla and spice notes as well, but mostly just that amazing sweet oak.

The palate is more of the same with sweet caramel, vanilla, and toffee flavors as well as some heat.  The burn is noticeable as it should be with a 100 proof dram but not harsh at all.  Very smooth.  There are some cinnamon and peppery spice notes as well, with a fairly thick mouthfeel.  The finish is fairly long, dry, and oaky.

This is not a complex whiskey.  This is bourbon, plain and simple, but done very well.  The oak tones in this whiskey are some of the best I've tasted, just makes you want more.  It's a fantastic sipper, and pretty good on the rocks as well.  I will definitely save this for those times I want something straight, no mixing for this bottle.  At $50 it is a tad pricey, but worth it in my opinion.  4.5/5.  Cheers!"

3.0,"Just had a pour of this edition of Old Forester's Whiskey Row after spotting it on the shelf at a happy hour.  Undoubtedly, the nose is the highlight of this bourbon -- but it may overpromise concerning what follows.  When I held it far away, just enough to get a hint of the scent, the strongest element was lemon peel.  A more intimate distance yielded sumptuous aromas of maple syrup and vanilla cream.  The nose was enough to get me very excited anticipating what was to come.  In comparison to that nose, unfortunately, the palate and finish are much lighter in character, featuring an airy caramel and syrup flavor, verging at times on malty.  The final notes are slightly astringent, and the drink as a whole has surprisingly little spice for a bourbon at 50% ABV.  The finish is nice, warm, leathery, and a tiny bit minty, but lacking a certain wow factor.  Old Forester 1897 is a solid 3.5, fun to drink, but a bit of a letdown -- particularly in its lack of complexity -- after a spectacular, shapeshifting nose."

Solid bottled in bond Bourbon. Classic profile with vanilla, oak, brown sugar, caramel and a slight hint of clove. Medium length. Pretty smooth stuff.

4.0,"Taste:  1 oz pour in Glen Cairn with 1 cube of ice

Nose (3.75):  Vanilla and almost like lemon pound cake come forward.  A bit of oak.  Not complex, very straightforward.  I got a stronger nose in original neat tasting.  The ice simplifies the nose a bit.

Palate (4.25):  Some honey-- almost like a bit o honey candy, vanilla, and distinct lemon poppyseed pound cake. The ice/water really enhanced this one on the palate and opened up a sweetness.

Finish (4.0):  I get a smooth burn from the ethanol, taste a bit of caramel and oakiness.  Finish is medium and very traditional with some dryness.  With ice this is a very straightforward and traditional bourbon.  It is not adventurous but it is great quality.  If you are looking for complexity it is not this one.

This is a quality crafted bourbon.  It is not a puzzler but an upfront sipper that I think may have been better with a bit of ice than neat.  The ice quelled the medicinal taste that I wasnt an admirer of without hurting the palate and nose."
2.75,"Neat, Room temperature, no water added in subsequent tastes, from a Glencairn. Barrel / Batch: undeclared. 

The nose is vanilla and oak, and it isn't subtle about it all.  It kind of leaps out of the glass and smacks you.  There's a certain spiciness in there too... pleasant as a background note.

The palate hit me as a lot hotter than the 100 proof should be.  Heavy on the alcohol, very woody.  But the major impression left was hot.  A second sip seemed hotter than the first.  I've got barrel proofs in the 120's that have less of a bite.

The finish was better, but took a little while to get to appreciate.  It is a long finish, driven by the full-body tackle that was the palate experience.  Once the tingle has subsided, I got to enjoy the vanilla and spice in the finish.  Orange too???  And certainly oak is still prevalent all the way through.

Second taste, added water to dilute a bit, still room temperature in Glencairn:

The nose is sweet, hot, oak, vanilla, and something else sweet... honey perhaps?  More complex and pleasing than before.  Worthy of multiple deep inhales.

The pallet was still warm, even with the addition of water, but greatly improved.  More spice than my first taste.  Still lots of oak.  The burn has hints of ginger in it.

The finish is more enjoyable with water added.  It is still quite long and leaves the tongue warm and coated for a while.  Oak, oak, and more oak prevail.  Vanilla is dancing in there too.

Overall the barrel dominates this whiskey.  I wanted to like it more than I do, but it isn't bad... it's just heavy handed.  I suspect this would make an excellent Old Fashioned."

3.5,"On the last pour of a bottle procured a couple of months ago in San Francisco duty free, and the absence of notes until now probably reflects my feeling that this bourbon is merely . . . fine.  Enjoyable, certainly, but without anything to set it apart as a higher-priced limited edition. Nose of cake batter, vanilla, red fruits, some faint hay or grassiness, grape drink. An initial searing heat when the bottle was first opened has been tamed a bit--but there's still a fair bit of fire. Heat and musty wood on the taste, followed by vanilla, char, black tea, bitter cherry, and something reminiscent of an herbal, bitter liqueur. Finish is hot but swift, warming the throat (with the heat persisting), but not a lot of lingering flavour.  At $20 and consistent availability, I'd make this a go-to (like some of the other bottled-in-bonds that punch above their weight-class--think Evan Williams, Old Grand Dad); at $50, you're asking a lot."

4.25,"I posted short review on this a while back here is full take:  The only Whiskey row series I hadn't had. Had to try it for $41 at Twins liquor sale. As ive stated before I love everything Old Forester. This is no exception. Poured neat, robust caramel and dark cherry coated candy apple up front. Sweet wood notes with strong rye spice, hell even some dill creeps in. Oily mouthfeel leads palate of delicious varnished candy apple and dark caramel with a mocha nutty note supported by the hefty oak and rye spice kick. Its not the explosion of the 1920 but in some ways for many that's a plus. Don't get me wrong this stuff has PLENTY of rich powerful flavor. Finish is wonderful long oak and drying cinnamon with caramel and nuts wrapped in milk chocolate. Savory and luscious with deep flavors this is another smash hit from OF. I still will take the 1920 but this is hella good...........93/100.......For those who don't care for barrel proof this will be AMAZING with heavy handed flavors that are heated to 100pf. This stuff can run with Col Taylor as best BIB bourbon which is sayin something......Update: going through the bottle it keeps getting better. Really exceptional bourbon imo. Worth getting both this and the 1920 for different levels(this will probably appeal to more people as its easier to handle)"

4.0,"Why have I ignored Old Forester until now? One answer is the price of the Whiskey Row series. The other is the underwhelming reviews by the expert reviewers on Distiller. It seems they aren't too keen on the Whiskey Row series, while the user reviews are consistently higher. After buying this I have to agree with users, this is good stuff and I look forward to trying more Old Forester bottles. You can definitely tell it is a Brown-Forman product, I get a lot of similar flavors as I have with Woodford Reserve and its Double Oaked line.

For a BiB it is not as pungent as cheaper BiBs. On the nose I get vanilla, oak, and alcohol. But not overpowering, light and delicate. I get more berries on the tongue in addition to that spiced dessert flavor. Not too oak-forward. I also detect banana as I have with Woodford Reserve and Jack Daniel's. That banana flavor is a dead giveaway for Brown-Forman. I do agree with other reviews that the finish is quick and slightly disappointing. I imagined it would linger longer at this proof. The smoke or mustiness pointed out in reviews is non-existent for me. Overall this is a solid, flavorful bourbon that is a little pricey but you won't regret the purchase. I'm really looking forward to trying the higher proof 1920 next."

3.5,"BACKGROUND: The 1897 Bottled In Bond expression was the second of four releases in the Old Forester Whiskey Row series of bourbons, which highlights various periods in the Brown-Forman company’s history.

The other Whiskey Row releases include the 1870, which symbolically evokes the original batching process of the first Old Forester bourbon, the 1920, which represents the company’s transition to a medicinal whiskey supplier during the 13 years of Prohibition, and the 1910, a heavily-oaked bourbon highlighting a bottling line fire that occurred at the distillery in the early 20th Century.

The 1897 celebrates passaged of the federal Bottled In Bond Act, which was promoted by large distillers seeking to combat rectifiers that sold low-end, sub-par products under the bourbon standard.

In order to be marketed as “bottled in bond,” a bourbon must meet stringent guidelines outlined in the federal law. The guidelines stipulate it must be the product of one distillery during one distilling season, it must be aged in a federally bonded warehouse for at least four years, and it must be bottled at 100 proof.

The Old Forester 1897 is made from a mash bill of 72% corn, 18% rye, and 10% barley.  It is bottled at 100 proof, as stipulated by the BIB Act, and, because it carries no age statement and must meet the BIB federal requirements, we know if is aged at least four years.

NOSE: The nose offers an interesting combination of both light and dark notes.  The red apple, citrus, and banana scents you would find in a fresh fruit salad are married with oak, leather, and musty goodness that the inside of a rustic rick house offers.

PALATE: A surprisingly full-bodied palate possesses the same apple, citrus, and banana that were present in the nose, but black pepper and spice are equally strong and prominent.  The sweet and savory aspects are each the distinct opposite of the other, but they marry together perfectly.

FINISH: The extra-long finish consists of oak and barrel char, but the well-defined flavor of chocolate mint swirls strongly on the back end.  It offers a good bit of mouth heat kick - perhaps from rye spice - but absolutely no chest hug follows.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: As noted earlier, the Old Forester 1897 offers competing and opposite flavors that combine exceptionally well.  If you like the Brown- Forman taste profile - including its trademark banana presence - you will enjoy this 1897 Bottled In Bond.  If Brown-Forman ain’t your bag, I recommend you go in another direction.

I have sampled all of the Old Forester Whiskey Row series offerings with the lone exception of the 1870 and have, to this point, enjoyed each of them immensely."

4.0,"-On the nose: Immediate sugary banana like the banana runts candies is accompanied by caramel apple, vanilla, and leather after breathing for a few minutes. A combination that’ll make you think “that smells weird but delicious”. 

-Palette and Finish: banana and caramel apple from the nose hit as soon as this touches the tongue, but are quickly gone and followed by black pepper, spices, leather, and light vanilla that stick with the finish which lingers long enough to be satisfying as these notes fade away. 

The proof feels just right in combination with the flavor profiles. It is warming but leaves room to feel the kick from the black pepper. 
This is delicious to drink and fun to taste. This is the bold flavor I was hoping for and already want to grab another bottle because this is delicious."

3.75,"Nose of banana, brown sugar, cherry, and leather with some ethanol heat in the background. 

On the palate we find maraschino cherry, a vanilla/caramel that is reminiscent of flan dessert, and cinnamon. Flavors are sharp; has considerable bite and drinks a little hot for 100 proof. Not terribly complex.

Finishes with yet more cherry, a really nice toffee note, oak, and some barrel char. Finish really lingers. Mouthfeel is on the full side of medium. 

Ch-Ch-Ch-Cherry bomb! In all seriousness this bourbon brings a very “old school” kind of bourbon profile which I guess was the idea. There are some really nice notes, but you do have to like a bourbon that hits back a little. There’s only one problem; the price. At $48, there’s just so many I would buy before this one, so it’s hard to see myself buying this again. But I’ll certainly enjoy the rest of the bottle."
