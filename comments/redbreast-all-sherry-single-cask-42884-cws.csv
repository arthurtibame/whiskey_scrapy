5.0,"Absolutely amazing.
Superb.
Fantastic.

I have heard the legends of the greatest irish whiskey of them all, the Redbreast, but i have never tried one before. In a tasting event, i made myself with a couple drams of this baby. It blew my mind. 

Lets start with something, my favorite whisky to this date is the glenmorangie signet. This one is its twin brother. 

Bottled at a fabulous 59.9%abv, is the darkest dram i have met so far. Almost treacle color. Maybe brown sherry color. 

I know i am writing a lot here, but spare me, when i find a jewel i like to share it. All irish whiskies are distilled thrice. Single pot still whiskey is a style of Irish whiskey made by a single distillery from a mixed mash of malted and unmalted barley distilled in a pot still.

On the nose is perfect. A dessert:
LOTS OF CHOCOLATE.
Coffee.
Cocoa.
Cocoa powder (formula) to make cocoa milk.
Impalpable sugar.
Dulce de leche. 
It is the end of the world as we know it. 

On the palate is also amazing.  
Prunes.
Chocolate.
Brown sugar.
Burnt caramel.
Butterscotch.

The finish is short. It is my only critic. It lost two points for this, leaving it with a final score of 98 over 100, BUT WHO CARES ABOUT THE FINISH WHEN YOU HAVE HAD THIS SPECTACULAR EXPERIENCE, LETS JUST GIVE IT THE PERFECT 100 OVER 100. SLAINTE MHATH!"
