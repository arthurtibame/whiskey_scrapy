2.75,"Ah man a diverse but not satisfying ride tonight. A Mr. Black coffee liquer with expresso (the only time I'm drinking coffee and loving the combo - adding a cacao husk gin takes it to next level) to start and then it went down hill from there, Benriach 17 yr Solstice which although great on opening has like a lot of Benriachs faded waay too fast and although started at 4.25 to 4.5 is now down to 3.75 at best.. will have to give the other bottle away. Old Armagnac, mezcal, grappa, bols none of which was great and now back to whiskey.

Sadly this was one I bought a sample of in my ""I'll try most things"" phase which I've now realised is pointless..if most people say it's average or crap it is. Hencenow a days I'll only seek the good stuff as drinking whiskey should always be a delight not a chore..which this is.

Sweet honey mead on nose and palate with a hint of oak.. very watery and artificial. Tomatin do great stuff but they really let themselves down by pumping out garbage like this."
