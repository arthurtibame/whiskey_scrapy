1.0,"I came into this with low expectations. There are few favourable reviews of this whisky, and I don’t think the folks at JW expected folks to drink this neat. Churchill and Thatcher were know to drown this one in soda water. Onwards...

The nose is bullshit. There are the faintest aromas of malt and honey buried under this weird, metallic note that smacks of barely legal grain whisky. The only other place I’ve encountered this is the budget Jameson, and it’s not nearly as offensive as this one. 

The taste isn’t altogether unpleasant. Malty, soft, with a little roundness in the mid palate, but a weird spike at the end despite the 40% proof. The finish is non-existent. 

This is not a good whisky. I might drink this if it were the only thing at a party and I could drown it with something, just like the legendary PM’s of old days. Otherwise, save your $$ for other things. For the same amount it costs for a bottle of this, you could buy a quality budget bourbon."

3.0,"Our family stopped by my mothers house for New Year’s Eve this year (well last year I guess) and I wondered if she would have any scotch. After a short investigation I managed to find a bottle of Johnnie Walker Red Label from another generation. I’m not sure which year they switched the striding man from walking left to walking right, but this was one of the older bottles with him walking to the left. 

I was surprised how inviting the nose was. I got some lemon zest, grass, and cola, but the overwhelming aroma was a sweet butterscotch. The palate was straightforward with some sweet corn, apple juice and cashew flavors before a spicy medium length finish. 

Overall I’m pretty impressed, I expected something more harsh. Though I have no idea how this whisky compares to the current Red Label bottling, it was an enjoyable drink to have as my last of 2019."

2.0,"The nose immediately is reached by an alcoholic scent, like a disinfectant (definitely not Laphroaig's medicine), accompanied by glue (!) and a bitter undertone. To insist with not a little courage, you can perceive a sweet base creaminess. Not very inviting, but on the other hand it is designed for cocktails, or to be submerged in ice if drunk alone...
On the palate, alcohol immediately arrives (and it's 40%!), quickly vanishing to leave room for cardboard (I swear!) and still a very clear bitter profile, almost formaldehyde. It looks like a chemical, solvent type: not so strong, obviously, but those are the sensations. The flavor has a very short life, unfortunately it takes more sips to be able to focus it... but there is a limit to how much I can sacrifice myself, so trust what is written above.
The finish is dry, bitter, sticky and fortunately short."

Taste: pear, sour apple, honey, pepper, cinnamon, dry sherry, bitter almonds, raisins, with the pepper increasing in the finish accompanied with a kiss of peat.

More flavorful than other blended scotches I’ve had in its class and price point, but its youth is still apparent and better suited to take on the rocks than neat. For a sipping whisky, the extra dollars to step up to the Black Label are worth it."

Taste - sweet peat smoke, brine, pear, honey, toffee, burnt bitter oak, moderate alcohol bite, finishing fairly quickly with lingering salty and bitter flavors. 

Honestly, I was expecting this to be much worse based on all the hate it gets. I like how the nose matches the taste so closely. It’s definitely not an amazing scotch (the burnt bitterness in the taste is the biggest fault for me), but I wouldn’t mind drinking it again at all."

2.0,"Nose is classic blended scotch.. quick fruitiness  that vanishes into ethanol & smoke with a hint of brine and oak. Palate starts with sweetness, then moves to a light peaty smoke, then goes to a warm caramel. Finish is unremarkable, in fact I've had to take 3 more sips while I type this just to remember it... you will see I still don't have anything to add. 
For the price I actually don't mind drinking this neat, but it definitely is meant to be enjoyed after you've had a few nicer drinks first."
