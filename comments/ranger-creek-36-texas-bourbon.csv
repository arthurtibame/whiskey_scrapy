4.0,"Bought this on a trip to Texas. 
While the nose is weak on aromas the taste is surprising. I enjoyed the spicy notes with the hints of sweet and smoky. Looking forward to their longer aged, bigger bottles in the future."

3.0,Good solid bourbon. The nose is very mild for a 96 proof.  Light oak and a soft earthy smell. The flavor has nice spice but it does need to be cut with a little water for the full flavor to come out.
4.0,"Hearty, earthy. Solid bite, medium burn."
4.0,Plenty of depth.... Taste profile is much  deeper than the aroma.... Well worth it

3.0,Oak. Vanilla syrupy. I think it's pretty drinkable for a small barrel

2.0,A little better than the Rye.  Company claims they can speed up aging process by using smaller barrels to give the whiskey  more contact..  I guess they never studied physics.  Not worth the money.

3.75,"Surprisingly complex for a young bourbon. Strong burn without much sweetness. Hints of leather, smoke, coffee, and vanilla. Enjoyed with some water to open it up and an ice cube or two to mellow it out."

4.0,"Color - Texas sunset
Nose - cherries, vanilla, molasses, brown sugar
Palate - bold and creamy, very full, some spice, more vanilla, more sugar
Finish - spice, sugar, some wood towards the end

Thick bodied and full like a true Texan drink.  That first sip hits hard but it’s worth it"

4.5,Complex and very different on initial nose and taste. I sense alfalfa hay or what they call straw. It threw me at first but I really like it.
3.5,"Ranger Creek 36 Bourbon

Nose: sweet and dense with green grains and wet hay, rolling into milk chocolate, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Ceylon tea and honey, and that funky Texas oak vibe is present throughout. 
Palate: sweet, rounded and oily. Brown sugar and buttery pie crust, orange peel, fruit jam, cinnamon, black tea, some nice peppery spice enveloping the mouth. 
Finish: caramel and vanilla cream, soft leather, pepper heat, sweet grains and molasses."
