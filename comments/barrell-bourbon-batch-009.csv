4.0,"On the nose, concentrated caramel, butterscotch, some musty notes. On the palate, sweetness (although, not nearly as much as batches 006 and 007), oak, cinnamon, and some medicinal accents. Medium mouthfeel. Hints of bitter chocolate and peanuts creep up after a few sips. Long, warm finish that spreads from the mouth to the throat to the whole midsection. 3/15/17"

3.0,"Nose: somewhat sweet but strong ethanol, smoke, leather, dried fruit and vanilla.  
Palate: very full body and syrupy.  Oak, sweet, spicy, but very hot!  Flavors linger for quite awhile.  
This stuff is pretty good overall.  For me it comes down to value as well, and this bottle runs $80.  I would go with Elijah Craig Barrel proof for being a bit better overall and lower priced."
