3.5,"Strong rubber component pretty much dominates the nose, but it's not unpleasant, the palate is rich and smooth, the finish is medium length, warming with a hint of rubber."
3.5,"Slight peat, lots of malt.  Not bad for $20."

2.0,"I love peaty whiskeys and a new peaty whisky with a distiller score of 93 made me very curious.  Unfortunately for the first time, ( have been lurking with distiller long time ) I disagree.  There is a distinct alcoholic nose ( kind of like the highland whisky from Aldi !!),  very low peat in nose and taste.  taste is smooth, very lightly peppery, medium length.  Overall very disppointing.  I had thought this must be a 80/100 rather than a 93."
3.75,Very rich and warm and comforting with just enough smoke without being overwhelming. Very easy to drink. Great intro to peat at a very nice price.

4.25,"Awesome for $30.  Peat, rubber, medicinal goodness.  Easy drinking and smoother than Laphroaig.  Good intro to peat and medicinal sweetness.   Great go to budget Islay taste."
4.0,"Very good peated single malt. Smooth from start to finish, not overly smoky. On the nose a little bit complex. Fruity tones pop out ocassionally."

4.0,Very smooth and smoky.
2.5,Astringent. Warm. Honey. Vanilla. Carmel. Needs a splash of water and some time to open up.

 Very nice nose"
