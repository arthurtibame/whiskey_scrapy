5.0,"Ok, it's an honor to drink the first run out of an old ass pot still, from such traditional place as Killbeggan! It's oily, copper with HEAVY rye spice dominating the alcohol and classic Irish taste? Wow. This is the craft whiskey of it's time! The pot still adds musk. The Jameson kid was using rye, before Irish whiskey died. To kick start this distillery with this liquid in the Irish whiskey boom? (Thanks Teelings!) It's an honor Killbeggan, Thank You."
4.25,"Nose is all pears and vanilla for me.  The palate is typical malt flavors with some spice, mint and sweetness.  Finish is citrus and just a hint of rye spice.  It does not taste like a rye, more like an Irish Whisky with more complexity.  I love it and hope I can find more.  A tremendous value."

4.0,"Nose is sour green apple, ginger, clove, prickly cinnamon-rye. Spearmint leaf. A lot going on.

Warm salt water at first taste,and it stays on the lips. Honey and corn syrupy stuff. Medium burn. Apple skins. Black pepper.  Peat hint, but it hits late. An earthy base: brown leaves.

With a droplet: The corn and sharp spice of the rye cut through. Spearmint, cinnamon, borderline Christmas-y. The spice is definitely what I notice.

With a big ice cube: the CINNAMON just punches through; forget your Fireball next time and get this. Spearmint, spicy leaves. There is definitely an autumnal, POTPOURRI element here, although I'm tasting potpourri a lot recently for whatever reason. BLACK LICORICE and anise stomp into the later stages."

Nose: vanilla; honey dew melon; slight butterscotch; slight caramel apple; very mild rye spice.

Taste: rather delicate and rounded yet rich on the palate with toffee, melon, that classic Irish pot still grain note and again a light kick of rye spice. Develops into sweet golden apple, soft pepper tingle and vanilla/caramel.

Finish: medium and warming, with hints of dark chocolate, pear and faded spices from the rye. Oh, and a wee copper penny note right at the end.

Value: $35-45 USD. Tough call! See below.

Final thoughts: not your average rye. The spice is quite muted and balanced with sweet tropical fruits and vanilla. This is as easy drinking of a rye as you’ll find. All in all it’s an interesting pour that could easily frustrate high-rye fans, intrigue rye sippers and open doors for rye noobs.

3/5 

Recommend trying or buying a bottle at a good price."

4.25,"This is a really interesting and delicious Irish Whiskey. Nose is sweet with hints of fruit and traditional Irish whiskey notes. Spice kicks in on the taste and mixes really well with apple, pear and maybe even a little vanilla. Has the taste I like in a traditional Irish Whiskey but with definite rye profile as well. A fun addition to the shelf."

4.0,"This is a cool whiskey. Bought it cause I like rye and hot whiskies, and my lady usually sticks with slightly-sweet Irish whiskey. It is lingering in the back of my mouth really nicely. It's oily, in a way, but then the heat and floralyness of it makes it feel dryer and lighter. Def an interesting drink!"
3.0,"Very little nose. Sharp rye taste, but without a lot of balance. Not something I would normally pick."

3.25,"Honey and stone fruits dominate the nose of this drink in a rich aroma.  There are hints of grain in the tail of the nose.

The whiskey tastes of fruit and rye grain in a rich and spicy experience.  One may detect notes of vanilla in the tail"

4.0,Sweet with spicy rye notes at the end.  Very enjoyable.
4.5,"Nose: Butter, pears, and fresh green herbs.  Next comes nice malt and buttered toast.  More rye spice the second time in, though none of that dill/fennel I usually get from ryes - thank god!  For some reason it reminds me of walking through a humid pine/fir forest after a rain - that resinous earth smell.

Palate:  Malty sweetness with a nice big kick of spices, like mint, rye, and that mix of cinnamon/allspice that I get from single pot stills.  There's this light citrus/pine note that rides above all that creamy malt.

Finish:  Long, mouthwatering on the tongue and dry on the edges.  This lasts and lasts through waves of toasty malt, butter, and vanilla cream.  There's a nice tingle on the sides of the tongue that I really like.

Conclusion:  Damn! This is phenomenal!  It combines all the tasty maltiness with great spiciness from both single pot still and rye (but without all the nasty dill/cilantro/fennel from american ryes).  Definitely glad I have another bottle of this around."

4.0,"This was a very pleasant surprise.

I usually drink bourbon and rye. I've had several big name Irish whiskeys and enjoy them, Jameson, Bushmills, Powers, Redbreast.  This is much more Irish whiskey than American rye whiskey and taste more like a scotch to me. 

The color is golden with honey on the nose. The taste is smooth with sweet grain notes."
4.0,"Since my ultra-Irish grandfather would rise from his grave and slap me if I didn't prioritize Irish whiskey in March...I'm trying out some new Irish drams! And, there is NO regret to be found about this having been one of them.

The concept is alone worth a sampling - an Irish rye? Well...yes and no. It's a rye whiskey in that rye is a portion of the mash bill (about 30%), but unlike American rye, it doesn't represent a majority of the mash bill. Instead, the traditional pot still mixture of malted and unmalted barley makes up the remainder. This creates a remarkably unique profile that's defined by both single pot still characteristics and the spicy, slightly herbal qualities that rye brings to the table.

The nose has notes of shortbread, chocolate, lemon zest, sea salt, coconut, cinnamon, clove, and a tiny hint of dill. The palate opens up with a very malt-forward shortbread, salted caramel, and chocolate profile, with light salt and citrus in the midsection, and then...bam, the rye notes suddenly come in with caraway, cinnamon, clove, and dill at the very end. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and coating, but not quite as rich as a pure single pot still.

This is quite unique, at least for me, in the world of whiskey, especially Irish. At $40 or less a bottle, too, it's a good deal. Slainte!"
