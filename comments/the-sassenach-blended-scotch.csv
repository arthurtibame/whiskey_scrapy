3.75,"Neat in a Glencairn. The color is light straw with a hint of peach. The aroma is subtle and clean; oak up front with hints of flowers and iodine. The flavor is both more assertive and a bit more complex. At first it seems typically coastal, but this impression is fleeting.  There is a honeyed quality followed by oak tannins and, no kidding, Sichuan peppercorns. The finish is long and suggests peat."
