4.0,I’m not a fan of infused whiskies. I prefer to add my own flavorings if the mood hits me but typically I drink whiskey neat (well maybe with a small piece of ice). I had a Smugglers Notch sampler gift pack hanging around so I thought I’d give it a try if for no other reason than to clean up the cabinet. I was favorably surprised. It was clean with a just a hint of maple that contributed more to its crispness than to sweetness. I’ve never really tasted “crispness” in a whiskey before but that’s how I can best describe this. This was a very pleasant dram. Now I have to get up to Vermont to get some more.
