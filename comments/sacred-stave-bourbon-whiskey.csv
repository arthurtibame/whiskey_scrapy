Included in a Bourbon Charity blind tasting. Voted number two for me out of 5 AZ whiskies. I’m a big fan of San Tan as a brewery and am excited to see them continue to grow as a distillery. I prefer their single malt to their bourbon but both are interesting and different than what some others are doing regionally. 

Sampled at home."
2.25,"This is a product of a local brewery that decided to take the leap into distilling just over a year ago. There inaugural  release was a Single Malt that was finished in a local winery's Syrah Casks. I wasn't overly fond of that one to be honest and found it wanting when compared to other craft single malts. The other day I noticed they had now expanded to include Bourbon and Rye to their portfolio with a Tawny Port Cask finish! For a craft Distiller that is a bit of a rarity. Getting any info on the mashbill or age has been impossible. I do know it's under 2 yrs old given the lack of a straight designation. We do also know that it is both distilled and aged by San Tan Distillery in AZ (so not simply sourced). Due to that and it's finishing I figured I should give it a try. So let's see how my states offering does! On to the tasting!
On the pallette it's a little hot immidiately with some brown sugar and vanilla evident. It quickly moves to the mid pallette where the big red fruit notes take over all the way thru the shortish finish. The port cask is doing all the heavy lifting here as this is clearly young stock (maybe a year old) that is really benefitting from the port cask. 
Now it's a pleasant enough pour and I commend a craft Distillery for spending money on a solid cask to finish. However, I struggle to recommend over the other options in it's price range. If you happen to live in or visit AZ, look it up and give it a taste as it's not a bad pour. Other than that, your aren't missing out on much! 
Cheers all!"
