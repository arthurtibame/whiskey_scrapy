null,Worth every penny.  Paid a lot more for a lot less.  At least you know you are getting quality in every pour.  A personal favorite that I hope continues to flourish!

4.25,"The color is a vibrant gold, very straw like. With some coaxing it leaves heavy legs clinging to the sides of the glass. The nose is very rye spice forward, but in a floral and subtle way. There are hints of minty dark chocolate with the zestyness of fresh fruit. The faintest hints of vanilla and oak come out the longer the whiskey breathes. The palate is gentle of floral rye spice alongside black pepper, with an almost creamy sweetness coming in behind it. The finish reveals more oak and vanilla as the spiciness fades, leaving a long finish with fading floral notes."

4.0,"I had a pour of this one sent to me by a new friend out of the Boston area.  I’ve heard good things about Whistlepig and I know the prices of their bottles have skyrocketed recently, so I was glad to get the opportunity to try this heavy rye whiskey.  It’s a shiny, new penny copper in the highball glass and doesn’t form any legs when you give it a nice swirl- just some tiny beads at the top of the oily slick once the liquid settles back down.  That’s a good sign.  Now, anyone that knows me knows that I don’t really like American whiskey, in general, and especially rye.  It takes a softer rye spice profile to win my approval, so please don’t take my overall score as an influencer over your purchase thoughts- especially if you love high rye juice.  That said, let’s delve into this one...

The nose started out very perfume-y for me with some very strong, yet clean oak pepper and spice.  Faint rye bread swirls around the glass along with some nice florals.  The first thing I noticed with the palate is how incredibly smooth it is- like buttah!  Scary smooth with a delicate mouthfeel.  I never thought I’d say that about a rye, but man it’s luscious.  More rye bread and pepper with just a hint of dill spice here.  Mid sip even feels more oily and tongue coating, which lead to a longer finish than I expected.  A lingering, warm pepper hangs around until long after you wash away the sip.

I think the thing I like the most is that this is a non-challenging rye.  I can see where serious rye drinkers would bash this one for being too gentle, but the 15 year aging really calms what probably should’ve been a beast.  I think I heard that bottles of this are going crazy on the secondary market, so I doubt I’d chase a full one- but every single time I got offered a pour I’d gladly accept and do my best Tiny Tim impression “please sir, can I have some more?”  Good stuff.  A big, hearty thank you to my Boston connection for this (he wishes to remain anonymous, but he will certainly read this).  Daddy like.  Daddy like, a lot.  4.5 stars.  Cheers."

4.5,"Whistlepig was founded by Apprentice contestant Raj Bhakta in January of 2010. The company and distillery operation are located on a 500 acre farm he purchased 3 years earlier in Shoreham, VT.  Successfully securing the services of master distiller Dave Pickerell (Maker’s Mark), Whistlepig began life as a bespoke whiskey producer and finishing agent specializing in rye whiskies sourced from MGP of Indiana and Alberta Distilleries of Canada. Distilling operations began in 2015 after several successful releases of award winning whiskies. This review covers their 15yo Vermont Estate Oak expression sourced from Alberta and finished for 6 months in charred new oak grown locally on their farm. The attraction of the American white oak grown here relates to the ring density of the trees due to the short growing season. They claim this adds additional flavor and complexity to their whiskey over white oak grown much further south. American white oak is also the wood required to age bourbon. Over the last year, I have become a big fan of good rye and can see why it has been gaining in popularity. Rye contains the least amount of sugar of the 4 primary grains used to make whiskey, so if you like dry, then give it a try.  I decided to compete this 46% ABV rye whiskey against 3 others without regard to pricing: Col. EH Taylor Straight Rye, 50% ABV; Crown Royal Northern Harvest Rye (Jim Murray’s World Whiskey of the Year in 2016), 45% ABV; and Bulleit Rye, 45% ABV. Whiskies were rated in 4 different categories: Nose, Spicy Palate, Dry Palate, and Finish. 10 points were awarded per category (1st- 4 points, 2nd- 3 points, 3rd- 2 points, 4th- 1 point). Taking 1st place on the nose was Bulleit Rye. It exhibited an unusual and unique nose consisting only of baking spices and oaken tannins, with no hint of vanilla or fruitiness that were readily apparent in the Colonel and Whistlepig. I found this to be different and appealing. The nose on the Crown NHR was pleasant but faint in comparison to the other 3. The Colonel and Whistlepig were tie for 1st place in the Spicy Palate category where the spice was greatly enhanced by vanilla, red fruits, and a touch of caramel. Here, a tad of sweetness complimented well and helped to deliver the victory. Bulleit was next in this category with good spiciness, but a little flat. The Crown, again, pulled up last with faint spices and little help elsewhere. For those who like dry over sweet I decided to make things fair by adding the category of Dry Palate. Here, the Crown NHR took 1st place with Bulleit taking 2nd, followed by Whistlepig and the Colonel. In the final category of Finish, again, the Colonel and Whistlepig were tied for 1st with lengthy and satisfying finishes. Bulleit was next and the Crown was last and lacking in robustness in comparison to the other 3.  In tallying the points, there was a 3-way tie for 1st place, with the Colonel, Whistlepig, and Bulleit all receiving 11 points and the Crown NHR taking only 7. As a tiebreaker, I decided to add a 5th category called Balance and Likeability, since 2 whiskies were clearly better than the others. So, at the finish line, Whistlepig takes 1st in this category by a hair over the Colonel to secure the overall victory. Whistlepig - 4.5 stars; the Colonel - 4.4 stars; Bulleit - 4.00 stars; and Crown NHR - 3.75 stars.  As an aside, I had already tasted all 4 of theses rye whiskies separately, and on several occasions previously."

4.25,"Incredible tasting rye. Similar flavor profile to the 10-year, but an explosion of flavors. The extra years did wonders for adding a well-balanced oak profile to this whiskey. The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is due to the price. Luckily, I tried this at a free tasting, but I wouldn't pay the asking price for it. Many other great ryes that fall under this price point."

3.5,"So I have been seeking this out for awhile, but no way I’m going to buy a bottle for $200 without trying it. I was fortunate to find a bar that offers a pour for $20.
Notes:
Smells less in your face than the 10 year, but delightful. Soft spice and green fruits. Palate is oily with a slight rye herbal spice.
Minty and grassy finish, and the spice is as predominant.
Overall, I personally wouldn’t buy this for bottle for $200. Instead I’d take Lot 40, Old Forester Rye, WP 10, and Pikesville all together over one of these."

0.5,"Not sure if I have a bad bottle or what but it's smooth when first drinking but I get extremely strong leather notes that nears ""skunk"" by the end and just stays. Just skunk. Like roadkill skunk. You know that smell? That's what I'm getting when I'm tasting this bottle. Absolutely terrible. I'm really disappointed I spent $300 for this bottle. I felt so strongly, I actually went online to see if anyone had the same experience and after reading the last several reviews here, I decided to give my own experience. never again. want my money back"

4.0,"Nose - Soft floral, light vanilla, fresh baked rye bread, light sweet yeasty dough.

Taste - Sweet fruity vanilla caramels on the front, orange zest, then kicks into this nice spicy cinnamon spice on the back palate as you swallow.

Finish - Lingering light fruity oak, cinnamon heat, floral vanilla caramel sweet, faint sweet mint.

Score - 83/100

Final Thoughts - This is a very interesting rye in that it didn't initially smell like a rye to me, but came out as more of a wheated bourbon due to it's softer, more floral nose. Not until it hits your tongue do you realize the softness is there, but there's also that rye bite that I think has been softened from all the years aging in the oak. It's very nice on the nose, palate, and finish as there's no off-putting flavors and the lower proof makes it infinitely sippable.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - Not another at the absurd prices, but at least I get a somewhat cool looking pewter topper?"

3.0,"I think maybe I just don't like Whistlepig?  

Nose: Floral and grassy with some background vanilla and brown sugar, wood notes coming through as well.

Flavor: Sweet and more grassy floral notes, very mild taste for a rye.

Finish: Medium length with some barrel spice and oak, a little tobacco and surprisingly not very spicy.

I think maybe Whistlepig is kind of boring.  Like they're trying to hide the rye spice.  Maybe it's just Canadian grains that are kind of mild?  Sort of meh."
