4.25,"Burnt brown sugar, caramel, rich but mildly, smooth spice of nutmeg, hot but enticing"
4.25,Magnum’s select - a lot of complexity to this one. Very tasty. Caramel tones.
4.5,This is an amazing pour. Smooth on the front end and a cherry bomb finish.
4.5,"sweet on the palette, flavor lasts for a good amount of time, high viscosity

nose is strong floral with a hint of oak, lots of vanilla

Palette starts sweet (heavy vanilla) and moves to slight spice, but that’s to be expected with the proof- spice doesn’t overpower the pour"
