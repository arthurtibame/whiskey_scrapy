5.0,"One of those rare, perfectly crafted whiskies where a superb spirit has worked in perfect harmony with the brilliant, well chosen casks it’s slept in. Sweet, spicy. Toffee hidden behind soft raisins. Nigh on flawless."

4.0,Caramel colour. Marmalade. Raisinous muscatty. Cooked orange peel. Pair with sticky date.
4.0,Salty caramel nose and taste of orange peel. Some said they felt eucalyptus aroma. The end is of smoking sticks.
3.5,"Glenglassaugh tasting evening, Sydney, Feb 19th. Whisky #4

Nose:
The good: Honeycake, current biscuits, strawberry shortcake, maple syrup, vanilla.
The bad: Rubber galoshes, fusty amontillado, baby sick, nail varnish, gentian violet (!).

Palate: A bold and full arrival with raisins, chocolate and salty caramel characteristics. As it developed there was a note of stewed fruits (apricots, peaches) and sticky date pudding. Water seemed to make the palate dryer (maybe uncovered tannin?).

Finish: Medium/long. Dry fruity notes that fade out into a sweet aftertaste.

One of the strangest malts I've tasted, and I'm convinced the sample we had was from a badly sulphured cask.

The nose had much more dry sherry than PX influence, and the oak notes and sherry seemed to be in a personal feud instead of contributing to the spirit. Overall the nose was sharply funky and confronting - way beyond an interesting challenge.

The palate fared much better and was somewhat Macallan-like, although bolder and darker. However I could not help but feel that the cask was a poor choice for the distillate - although as said above, maybe it was just this particular cask.

The group was sharply divided on this expression - most found it delightful and it was their favourite of the core-range expressions we tasted on the night. However a handful (myself included) thought it was repulsive on the nose.

Very difficult to score this - personally I thought it was badly flawed and only rated 2 stars, however I'm going to compromise and give it 3.5. This is my star-rating equivalent of the average it has received from contributors both here and on Whiskybase.

I'd be very interested to try this again at some stage from a different batch.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"
4.25,Sweet nose. Initial sweetness from the Pedro Ximenez second cask makes way for notes from the original bourbon cask. A sherry finish done well.
4.5,"A stunning, puddingy dram."

3.75,"Woah ho ho, Glenglassaugh I have wronged thee by placing you in the pile of crap. Now you aren't reaching to great heights but you have climbed to the top of the pile of crap. I'd call you the king of the crap pile but that would insinuate you weren't that good and you are.

The PX bolts out of the gate. Very mild sulphurousnous balances well with the dark fruits and raisins. Now it is thin and the aftertaste not really there but not to shabby a dram."
3.5,Heath bar nose. Super sweet rolo candy palate.  Very slight hint of spice finish.

4.75,Mash Tun Finish Flight. Absolutely fantastic 👍
4.75,"Final dram tonight is Glenglassaugh Pedro Ximenez Sherry Wood Finish.  Here's a dram that redefines expectations. Exploding with strawberry preserves, rum raisins, gingerbread cookies, orchard fruits, sponge cake, honey, and figs, it's fruity to be sure, but it's by no means a sherry bomb. Rather, the cracked white pepper and ginger notes typical of Glenglassaugh come out in full form, particularly in the palate, further enhanced by a touch of dark chocolate, raspberry jam, biscuits, plum, pears, and a fleeting bit of dememara sugar. There's clove, too, and a slight musk. On the finish, there's loads of those dark fruit notes: raisins, plums, figs, dates--and it turns the roof of your mouth into a canopy of flavors. There's cracked black pepper, but it has a back seat to the fruit medley. It does something few of the sherry cask finishes achieve: neither on the light, tangerine and fruitcake ting that from a quick trek in the cask that only flirts with what the sherry cask can offer, nor the picking up on heavier notes only with the loss of its pre-cask character.  This somehow comes out of the cask an oddity: distinctively Glenglassaugh and yet distinctively a dense sherry contribution. Finish doesn't just last: it sings. Still after minutes have rolled by and the dark fruits are still hanging, giving much to ponder."
