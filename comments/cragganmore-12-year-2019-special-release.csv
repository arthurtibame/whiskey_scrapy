4.5,"It is indeed alienating to have the nose being welcomed by a very meaty and ""chewable"" peat, as if you were approaching a Ledaig, but it is only the initial impression: a delicate spiciness accompanies soft custard, cinnamon, green apple, an impression of seaweed and a citrus touch. Wood. Rough and at the same time caressing, very intriguing. The important alcohol content is not felt at all.
On the other hand, at the palate it is quite noticeable, but it is not the punch that one could imagine: an impetuous yet warm and enveloping effluvium. The peat always very present, with a much more accentuated mineral note, in this rich spiced cake with a mixture of vanilla, ginger, cinnamon, wood chips and lemon zest, cooked with charcoal.
The aromas accompany for a long time (together with the alcoholic hit), with wood drenched in sea water, vegetable peat, charcoal, vanilla and cinnamon.
Take the elegant composure of the classic Cragganmore and have it worn by Vin Diesel, who comes along to embrace you affectionately: here, this is the effect that this dram gave to me.
Rough, impetuous yet capable of being welcoming and soft, in a precarious balance that seems to work miraculously.
But it damn works!"
