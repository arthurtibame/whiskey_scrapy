4.25,"Say what you will...but this 20 year old from Costco is a really nice single malt!  It may not come in a fancy box that people can resell on eBay, but it’s a really satisfying scotch at a great price."
3.0,"Nose - Sweet bing cherries, blackberry cider, spiced apple cider, sweet dough after a while.

Taste - Sweet fruity peppery spice/heat/tingle, lightly oaky cherry/berry cider, orange zest/pith bitter, light ginger.

Finish - Lingering spicy tingle, cherry/blueberry/blackberry sweet, bitter ginger beer tingle.

Score - 83/100

Final Thoughts - Not sure if I'm having an off day or because the weather has finally cooled off & it's actually sprinkling/drizzling today but this wasn't as good as I expected it would be. Had a nice fruity/sherry nose but it seemed a bit off balance on the palate. Had this almost metallic fruity note but not quite there, similar to hints of metal I occasionally get in super dense/syrupy dried fruits. Overall, a very decent sipper that seems to have things mostly balanced, but there's just this intangible I can't pinpoint. If I was looking to sip on something sherried without thinking too much, this would fit the bill. I think this might also work very well in a sweeter highball. I think the flavors are strong enough that they would get complemented very well by some soda water.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - Not another"
3.0,"Color - A rich gold.

Nose - sweet, vanilla, grassy, peach

Palate - spicy, salty, explodes on the tongue, a slightly unpleasant after taste of dried leather.

Finish - Medium long

Water increases the vanilla smell and calms down the explosiveness on the tongue."
4.0,"Tasty, sweet but a little astringent.  Not the complexity I'd expect from a 20 year, but certainly good.  Reminds me of the Glenmorangie original but with a good bit moore complexity with extra oak and sweetness."
4.25,"aroma: honey, white wine musk, hints of caramelized sugar
taste: honey, white wine, tons of oak and finishes with a bit of spice.
Well worth the price"

4.0,"#Whiskybattle of #Costco white-labeled #singlemaltscotch (#KirklandSignature). Both were distilled by @alexandermurrayco and matured for final 6 months in Oloroso sherry casks at 46% ABV. Reviewed on 8/6/2018.
....…......….…...........................................................................
Nose:

The 18 year-old (on the left) has notes of creamy vanilla, green grapes, and raisins...with a slight hint of sulphur. Score: 88.
The 20 year-old has stronger notes of vanilla (bean vs. cream), fresh pineapple, and honey. Better nose than the 18 without the sulphur. Score: 91.
....…......….…...........................................................................
Palate:

The 18 has notes of raisins, plums, and all the lovely dark, dried fruit. Slight alcohol burn. Score: 87.
The 20 has more complexity; I can pick out notes of dried apricots, sweet caramel, honey, and brown sugar all in a smoother dram than the 18. No alcohol burn despite the same ABV of 46%. Score: 90.
....…......….…...........................................................................
Finish:

The 18 has a slightly sweet medium finish for a score of 86.
The 20 has a nicer, lingering oaky dry finish with more flavor and depth. Score: 89.
....…......….…...........................................................................
Overall Experience:

It’s amazing how 2 more years in the barrel makes such a difference in every aspect (except for color, which are both tawny orange). The 18 gets a score of 87 and the 20 gets a score of 90.
....…......….…...........................................................................
Value for Money:
The 18 year old sells for a good value at $55 USD but the 20 year old is a more compelling value for just $3 more ($58). That’s 1 point for each $1! There’s a big difference between a 90 and an 87 in the way I rate my scotch.

4.0,"Don’t be fooled by whiskey snobs on here who have convinced themselves that throwing relative value to the wind is an acceptable practice- for $55 this is a great 20 year staple scotch that eclipses many scotches at the $100 price point - And I should end this rant there; however:  It’s spicy, has and above average complexity, it’s a little softer than the 18, the mouth feel is ...  meaah, but the finish is quite satisfying. All n’ all the flavors are just a little disjointed in comparison to say... a center cut macallan at 7 times the price, but for the money you can’t go wrong. This is definitely worth picking up a few bottles next time you’re at Costco. 👍🏼"

4.25,"Nov 2019.
Clear brown amber.
Small tulip.
Aromatic sherry butt, old leather, old furniture, dried tree bark, nutmeg, cinnamon, dried sweet spicy, and dried leaves in nose.
Full body with warm leather, forest wood, dried licorice, dark roasted nuts, fig, dried herb and a little sherry sweet in palate.
Good balance Oloroso sherry and sweet sweeten plum finish."

3.5,"Man I wanted to really like this. Kirkland brand usually makes great products at a discount. 20 year kirkland for 55 bucks sounded really good. My high expectations led to a bit of disappointment. I thought other whiskies around the same price taste better.

The Kirkland has a bit of a bite to it; It is not as smooth as I expected. There are lots of flavors in this blend, so not bad. It seemed to me more like a Johnnie walker blend."

4.25,"Damn, I’m happy I stopped into Costco today. It’s been a brutal week and was in need of some good news. I guess I consider this a solid, small victory as they just got this Scotch in a day ago. I heard good things about the Kirkland 18-year-old Scotch and had been looking for it to no avail, and was excited to see my Costco was offering a 20-year-old Speyside single malt with a sherry-cask finish. It was $56, and it’s proved to be a damn-good offering.

I’m sure you’ll find better tastings in the 18-20 year range, but I’d put this up against any 15-year old Scotch that I’ve tried...and it’s the price of a good 12-15.

Nose: Sweet, bready with waves of vanilla, honey and lemon icing. Almost reminds me of Sprite with the intense sweetness and citrus flavor. Definitely some notes of dried fruits with a touch of saltiness as well at the end. It’s truly a pleasant nose. 

Taste: It keeps changing. To me, that’s a sign of a top-tier whiskey. Or at least that's a quality I value in whiskey. I’ve gotten about nearly a dozen different tastes, and they all are cohesive with the nose. At various times I’ve gotten honey, mango, pear, coffee, a touch of cherry, green apple and sweet rolls (a la any Roadhouse restaurant where they throw peanuts on the floor)...oh, and I also get peanut brittle, too! 

Finish: At 46%, there’s a little burn at the end...but it goes with the entire drink. This doesn’t fight you, but rather takes you for a straightforward and enjoyable ride as that slightly burns complements the sweetness throughout.

Overall/Value: If you can get it for $55-$60, jump on it. I’d pay $75-$80 for this, comfortably. It’s a fun experience without doing anything crazy. I could easily see comparable Scotch going in the $100 range."

3.75,"It's another Sunday afternoon and that means the weekly Costco run! This always involves the obligatory walk the Liqour section as the on occasion have some gems for well under SRP. This week there was nothing overly special but this one was down to the last 4 bottles. It had the dreaded star by it (Costco's way you of letting you know they won't be getting any more). Having not pulled the trigger since the beginning of the year, I finally decided why the heck not. 
Having read the mainly positive reviews on here and the 92 point score from the Whiskey Advocate helped make the decision. I'm addition to this, it is bottled by Alexander Murray who I have had positive experiences with (most recently their Cask Strength Dalmore 15 year). 
For background, this is a 20 yr old single malt from an undisclosed Speyside Distillery. It's aged exclusively in ex-bourbon barrels for 20 years and then finished for a short 6 months in Oloroso Sherry casks. It is bottled at a very respectable 46% abv. Having recently had another well aged Speyside Whisky (Glenfiddich 18) I was very curious to see how this one stacked up (at 50% of the cost!) On to the tasting!
On the pallette it's a solid meduim viscosity with the dried red fruits right upfront. Cherries, plums and a hint of figs. This then transitions to caramel, toffee with some nice old leather on the mid pallette. Finish is pretty long and packs a nice oak note that's slightly drying. It's pretty dominant with some spice and then the red fruits return and linger. Lovely pour. 
Now as it compares to the Glenfiddich 18, hands down I would drink this over it. It's richer and more viscous. It's also has the better finish, although the Glenfiddich is a bit more complex. 
The next thing that really jumps out to me is just how much of an influence the Sherry Cask finishing has on this dram. It's really pronounced. Definitely a first fill proper quality cask! 
At $57 it's a great buy, however, it's not life changing in anyway. It's lacks the complexity of a true $100+ dram. I would expect more complexity from a 20 yr Whisky and this to me holds it back from being a 4+ star dram even at the incredible price point for the age. 
In summation, this is a very solid but not quite special dram! If you are a Costco member and enjoy Sherry influenced well aged Whisk(e)y, give this one a try. Cheers all!"
3.0,Fruity nose

2.5,"Vanilla and honey on the nose with a bit of acetone, smokey mouthfeel. Bit of a harsh finish though, especially for a 20."
3.0,"Not bad. I was expecting more from a 20-year, though, honestly. I like my Cragganmore 12 better. This has some decent flavor, but not as smooth as I like."
5.0,"Amber color, clear, viscous. Nose is delicate, mature, with forward notes of Sherry, almonds, cinnamon, vanilla, caramel, Maple, and honey, no smoke. Palate is sweet, with salty and bitter notes, full body, and round texture. Aftertaste is long and strong, with oak, vanilla, butterscotch, and more Sherry. A few drops of water open more nuts on the nose, and pallet suddenly gains Apple, raisin, and cherry tones. Finish gains some cocoa notes. Overall complex and well-balanced dram, definitely worth the money and very enjoyable."

4.25,"It’s time for another Costco store brand whisky, this time it’s a 20 year old, Speyside single malt scotch.  It’s bottled under the Kirkland brand for Costco and it’s believed to be ex-bourbon cask Mortlach or Longmorn whisky that’s been finished for around 6 months in an ex-sherry barrel that previously held Macallan.  It typically sells for around $55-60 and bottled at 46% ABV.  Thanks to Virginia liquor laws, I’m unable to buy it locally and I have to rely on a sample from a friend.  Thanks @dubz480 for the generous pour.

It’s a wonderful sunset copper in the Glencairn.  It’s also seriously oily and thick appearing, with fat legs and slow running drops.  The nose begins with a delicious grape jam note that segues into buttery, rich sherry.  There’s a surprising heavy oak cask bite that acts as a backbone to all of the sweetness.  It even gives off a new, virgin oak vibe- sawdust and biting wood that’s peppered and lightly charred.  There’s no heat, even at 46%, and I think that’s due to the spirit taking on the properties of one that’s been triple distilled, even though I’m sure this one wasn’t.

The palate is also butter smooth, which is no surprise to something that’s been in a quality cask for two decades.  Again, the grape must and sherry note leads the way before relinquishing it’s hold on the tongue for the late, back end vanilla and toffee flavors.  The transition seems timed and there’s a lingering, vine-ripened fruit and berry note that permeates the finish.  It’s a rich, warm finish at that- medium in length with some oak tannins and cask tones that reveal a well-aged whisky.

Overall, for $55 this can compete in just about any value for money competition.  It would even hold its own in a Speyside sherry-finished whisky contest, regardless of age.  The two decades it spent are noticeable, the sherry finishing is apparent, but it doesn’t mask the ex-bourbon properties either.  This is a very fine whisky and one Alexander Murray and Costco should be very proud to offer.  4 stars with a bump for the price point.  4.25 stars, quite easily.  Cheers."
