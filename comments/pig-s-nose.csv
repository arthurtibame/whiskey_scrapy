3.0,Okay.  Great for  cocktails
3.0,"Pig's Nose, a 5 year old blended scotch whisky by Whyte & Mackey. Price $30.00 Sampled 11/30/15 with 1.5 teaspoons of water in a Glencairn spirits nosing glass.

Aroma - Very young and sour, glue, soap, sawdust, corn, light vanilla and sherry influences.

Taste - Light cherrywood, inherently sweet, vegetal and with a earthiness found in that of black eyed peas. 

Finishes with a quick flavor and burn. 

Final score : 3 / 5, why a higher mark? The texture. The mouth feel on this whisky is one of the best I have ever felt in my life, I'm not sure how they manage it, but it is incredibly, smooth, oily, slick and soft. It drinks so easily that it scores decently well. You won't find anything complex here, but the flavor is fine and the mouthful makes it an absolute pleasure of a session sipper. Would definitely buy again and keep on hand."

4.0,"Light, dry with mild fruitiness. Very easy drinking. Extremely good value if you like a lighter whisky. Notes state there's a smokiness about it, but I'm buggered if I can find it !"

1.0,Hated this! Never send the husband for Scotch! No flavor but bitter alcohol. Too light. I️ think they lied about the ABV: I did not even feel any alcohol. Just plain BAD!! We need negative stars.

4.0,Who are these people that have reviewed this amazingly underrated scotch.  It's smooth if you don't like scotch don't drink it. Amazingly smooth blows away everything in its price range.  Light smoke with a sweet honey flavour and a touch of earthy almost sea salty malt.  If you don't like Scotch please don't drink this and review it.  Drink it neat and enjoy this cheap and simple luxury  for what it is.

3.0,Decent. Good in a cocktail.
3.0,"Nose: it stinks! Shoe leather with orange and just a hint of vanilla

Palate: orange, sweet / honey.

Finish: short and non-descript with rising spice

A little water balances the nose (much improved!) but even a few drops dulls the taste.


Overall: I think this would be a good mixer with ginger all perhaps. Not bad, but a bit too mild and sweet for my taste."
3.0,"Smokey, peaty and strong aftertaste"
2.0,"Light, smooth, everyday, just ok for me."
2.0,"Taste like rubbing alcohol, gets a little better with ice."

2.0,"This one really doesn't agree with me at all. The nose is sour and leathery, and the palate is leathery, dusty, and oily. There's a sweetness beneath the salty, malty leather, but even with ice I find that it's such a bittered taste I can't really get to any of the elements I might enjoy. Definitely a pass for me."

3.25,"Got this along with Dewar's 12YR The Ancestor to compare.  After trying it a few different ways - straight, with water, on ice - I became aware of a very strong caramel nose and taste.  Not displeasing, but very one-dimensional.  Would never turn it down and under $25 a good contender to other daily tipples such as JW Red."
