4.0,Fruit and spice notes on the nose. Initial fruit followed by sweetness and vanilla on the palate. Short soft aftertaste. Very nice Canadian whiskey @ $39.95 in the lcbo

2.0,"Sadly theirs just not much to it. Very light and bland.  That said,  I’ve been tasting some heavy scotches this week so I’ll give it another chance....or two."

3.0,Huge sasparilla and powdered sugar followed by immature alcohol burn and dominant woody bitterness. I've had worse but will probably never buy again.

3.0,Sweet raw oak and cream soda vanilla. Decent but I wish the raw oak was aged out. Basically a more refined Dillon’s Rye. Still not one I’d buy. $35 in Ontario.

3.0,"Not sure how i feel about this one.   One of the strangest tasting whiskys I've ever tasted.  To me it has two distinct  notes, which are pepper  and vanilla.  STRONG vanilla.   More than I've  ever tasted in a whisky before.   I gave it a 3 because  sometimes I really  enjoy it and other times its  just  too different and overly  sweet on the nose.   That being said  I think it's  really  great to have the option  of a whisky that tastes  like this.  It adds to the growing  number of completely unique and high  quality  Canadian spirits."
4.0,"There is something quite different about this blend. 

Just about a 4.0 for me.

$34.95 in Ontario"

4.0,"Sweet, creamy mouth feel. Very high vanilla and then transitioning to something quite sweet as a finish."
4.0,"This is a very good value in Canadian whiskey.  I love the balance between the sweetness of the barley malt and the spice of the rye, with corn in the background rounding things out.  This is my go-to everyday Canadian whisky."
