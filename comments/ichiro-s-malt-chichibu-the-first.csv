2.0,"Whisky on the Hudson 9/18/2014 : This is my first taste of Japanese whiskey and wasn't sure what to initially expect. I found the nose to have a fruity sweetness with some butter hints.  The whiskey on the palate hit me with a sweet, light plum profile.  The texture was extremely thin and felt like it was watered down.  I sadly found this to finish with almost nothing.  A disappointingly bland finish.  I was hoping for a rich, fruity sweetness dram.  When calculating the cost of the dram or bottle into to the score, then this gets 1 star."

3.0,Feels like a very young whisky. A little smoke on the finish. Wouldn’t buy a bottle at secondary prices.
