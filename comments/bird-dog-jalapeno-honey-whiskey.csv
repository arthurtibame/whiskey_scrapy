          Simply cannot recommend under any conditions, perhaps as a baseline for what you should never EVER do to whiskey.  Perhaps a jalapeno by itself, but this combo of pepper and honey simply doesnt work.  It's difficult to imagine someone actually said this was a ""GO"" to release on.  This is likely the clear result of what happens when you put marketers in charge who don't understand what bourbon whiskey is about.
