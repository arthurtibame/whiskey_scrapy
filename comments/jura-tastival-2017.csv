3.0,"not really complex.  missing flavour. but not bad, just ok."
4.0,"Delicious and complex, though also unusual. 

Takes a few minutes for the nose to open, but when it does, it's wonderful. There's the port influence, some walnut, some fruity undertones... Great stuff. The palate has additional hints of peach and oak, with a slightly syrupy texture. It all works together, though I admit I'm not used to so much nuttiness in a single malt. 

Worth trying!"
