5.0,"An unbelievable combination of 19-35 year old Hanyu whisky from the extinct distillery of master Ichiros family. Upon the first sip you can taste the complexity of flavours, smooth and exciting with vanilla, oak, cinnamon, spices, and a light peat finish that excites the palate. What an experience"
