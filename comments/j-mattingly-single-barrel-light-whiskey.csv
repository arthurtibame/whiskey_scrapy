4.5,"Neat. Neck pour.  This is my first Light Whiskey.  MGP, 12 year, 137 proof.  As you imagine, it is hot on the nose.  Intense butterscotch, super rich.  Some nice fruit, I’d call it blue berries even.  Caramel and vanilla.  Graham cracker. Cotton candy.  So just sweet sweet sweet.

Quite viscous and syrupy.  Initially dark on the tongue with a maple syrup.  Lights up the mouth with flavor.  Explosion of that butterscotch.  Transitions to the blueberries, brings it back to the caramel, and ends on the graham cracker.  The caramel lingers.

Man that is good.  Official a light whiskey MGP fan.  So rich and flavorful.  That proof is over the top and hot on the nose if you go in too deep but not present on the taste.  It’s hot, there are hugs, but it never hits you with ethanol on the taste.  Risky purchase that paid off.  This is a great pour."
