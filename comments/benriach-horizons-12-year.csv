4.0,"The sherry finish shines on the nose. In the mouth, it’s sweet, tangy and citrusy. A lovely long finish adds chocolate to the mix. This bottling has been replaced by a 10-year version available in travel retail, but a few more bottles are making their way into the market thanks to the discovery of some overlooked cases in a Brown Forman warehouse."
