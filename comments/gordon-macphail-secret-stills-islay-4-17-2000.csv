Distilled:  November 2000
Bottled:  May 2012
Cask type:  First Fill Bourbon Barrels

Soft, sweet and peaty upfront.  There’s a good hit of vanilla which fades slowly away to a salty, ashy aftertaste.

Part of the Secret Stills range, it’s not much of a secret that this is a Bowmore - it’s all over the internet!

This is a nice light peaty dram.  It’s very dry on the aftertaste which means it doesn’t really work as a ‘session’ whisky, but it is a pleasant dram."
