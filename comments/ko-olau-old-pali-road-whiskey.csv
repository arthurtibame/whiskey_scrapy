1.0,"Reminds me A LOT of Mellow Corn... Except it's younger, lower proof, and 4 times more expensive.... Their new make was great though. I wish they would age in full sized barrels for at least 4 years... Currently they are only in 20 liter barrels and less than 2 years old, then blended with sourced corn whiskey. I'm sure they can turn an excellent product considering their new make is great.... They are just not there yet."
3.5,90% corn. Smooth and light otherwise
