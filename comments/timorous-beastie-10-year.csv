4.0,"4/5 for excellelent value!   If you live in Ontario and enjoy Glencadam 10 but don't feel like forking out nearly $100 for it, this is a great alternative.    This is a very spirit driven malt with notes of vanilla fudge, yeast, lemon and barley malt on the nose with a very honeyed, Graham cracker palate almost as if it were a 10 year old version of old pulteney!   Love the natural light straw appearance and the 46% avb.   The finish is short, but for a $60 10 year old blended malt it's acceptable.   Not exactly smoothe on the way down, also a bit tannic and bitter on the finish, but the pleasant sweet flavors more than make up for it.  it's not Glencadam 10 (which I love in this style), however given the value and slightly better nose,  I will buy again!"
