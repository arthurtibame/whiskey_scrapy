3.0,"Batch 003 seems to vary a little; mine is bottle 679, 52.65% ABV. At 105.3 proof, benefits from drinking with an ice cube to let it open up. Nose has hints of cherry, vanilla and fresh whipped cream. Palate has light peach sweetness before the alcohol kicks in; texture is thick and buttery. Finish has a little baking spices and shows some of the port/sherry barrel finishing it underwent."
