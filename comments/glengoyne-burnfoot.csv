2.0,"i bought this before i started examining sherried whiskies properly - and having arrived in whiskyland on the stable expression peat-bus, i was interested in the facts that glengoyne burnfoot is a completely unpeated expression, a nas, and a travel exclusive.

it was a bad jumping off point to sherry given my journey to date.  an unremarkable nose, heavy cereal notes on the palette and a finish that was frustratingly short.

i've read other online reviews that talk of the wineiness across this dram - but i can't find it.  to go back to the peat; a talisker port ruighe nas shows how to get some big wine notes to lift up a smokey base.  And to go further into sherry; try a glenfarclas 105 nas and the wine is unmistakable.

in short - glengoyne burnfoot is an interesting offering that is drinkable but unremarkable."
