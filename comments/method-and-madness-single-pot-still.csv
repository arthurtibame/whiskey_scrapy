4.0,"Nose: Apple, sherry, spices, orange peel and some lovely fragrant dusty wood aromas. There are trace notes of licorice and mint in the background. The nose is quite pungent and there is a distinct prickle from the alcohol, even though it's below 50% abv. Over time the nose settles and broadens and a very nice buttery quality develops. This is a delight to nose.

Palate: Very big arrival - sweet, dense, dark fruits - a sugary background but it's not simple sweetness, the sugars are brown sugar and coffee crystals with a malty and almost molasses quality. Rich, warm and encompassing. Glace fruits, caramel, malt and baked bananas with a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar come out in the development. The texture is mouth-coating and comforting, like a soft blanket.

Finish: Medium/long. Spicy baked fruits. With water the aftertaste becomes more malty and gains just the right level of sweetness.

I tasted the Method & Madness Single Malt a few months ago and enjoyed it very much. This pot still expression is every bit as good - maybe even better.  It's oily, rich and nutty with layered complexity and it has an aura of completeness about it that makes it very satisfying. I could drink this regularly.

Adding just a drop of water does it no harm, but don't add too much. The nose loses the prickle and melds together more but most interesting is a smoky note that appears out of nowhere on the palate. I'm not sure if I prefer this whiskey neat or slightly watered (just half a teaspoon is enough) - both ways are enjoyable.

Sadly it's out of stock in Australia at the moment and we probably won't see another allocation. When it was available it was AUS$125 (about US$70) which in this case I would call a genuine bargain - I wish I'd bought a bottle when it was around. If you see this, grab it - highly recommended.

Tasted from a 30ml sampler - my thanks to @Soba45 for the tasting dram.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

4.5,"Spicy, butterscotch, yellow, jasmine, very drinkable,
Tried with 2 iced cubes"
4.5,"Nose: sweet candy, mint, and slight fruity notes.
Taste: heavy fruity flavor with a subtle note of cinnamon. Woodsy on the finish.

One of my favorite Irish whiskeys I’ve ever had. I wish it was more readily available in the US."
4.0,"I've refined my tasting approach to pour, wait a bit, smell, taste neat spit out (if the first dram of the session to acclimatise my palate to the alcohol), wait for a bit, smell, taste neat and consume, add a few drops of water (dependent on the whiskey) repeat, wait consume more often with food. I find the method seems to really get the most out of what the whiskey has to offer. It paid off in spades with this one. I'm a BIG fan of the Midleton distillery. With the demise of Glendronach and to a certain degree Laphroaig it's moved to the top spot in my preferred distillery list. The diversity of offerings from the Spot, the Redbreast, Powers and now Method and Madness ranges (plus more) each quite different from the other.. it's almost like a few distilleries rolled into one which given it's history I guess it is. Anyhow the nose on this one was beautiful. Cacao (I paired with chocolate cake leftovers from the cake we were making for my 5 yr old sons birthday), ginger, sherry, chestnut, caramel and more. On the first couple of tastings I was disappointed but over time it opened up the spicy oakey caramel chestnut flavors coming to the fore. Now this is not a perfect whiskey by a long margin. Even with time and attention it's young and slightly harsh on the aftertaste but it has one unique quality... it's unique and interesting. I took a punt and grabbed a bottle and although I don't regret it for the $70USD price I wouldn't grab another. Definitely worth a try,  maybe a buy."
