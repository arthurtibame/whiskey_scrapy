5.0,"Nose: Initially quite strong in alcohol, but as that subsides it gives way to sweet ripened berries. Light notes of toasted oak and vanilla come to the fore the longer it is allowed to breathe.

Palate: Initial sweetness and slight spices notes that give way to milk chocolate and strawberry liqueur. A quick alcohol burn opens up to an opulent and complex dessert sweetness owed mostly to the PX cask finish.

Finish: Long and sweet, the berry sweetness lingers on the tongue, with the light mouthfeel of the liquid itself giving way to a delicate end."

5.0,Great Irish whisky.Smooth. Fruity and vanilla notes.
4.0,"Bought in Wolfsburg, Germany

The first thing you notice is the intensity of the sherry cask - in this case Pedro Xìmenez (or PX).  The whisky has certainly spent a lot longer in these casks than just a finishing period - soft, sweet notes envelop the nostrils and follow through into a very easy drinking finish"

It's not a bad dram but nothing special...a bit like the Powers but lacking the body and viscosity. One of my least favourite pot stills so far. Solid 3."

5.0,"One of Ireland's best single malts in this age range. There is an initial hit of fresh pine on the nose that gives way to sweeter notes of vanilla and ripened berries. The palate is rich and peppery with red fruits and milk chocolate, while the finish is long-lasting as PX sherry comes to the fore."

3.0,"Nice nose but to me it's juniper forward aged gin not a whiskey. Oak, sherry & notes of junpier. Oaky finish with a touch of cereal grain. Good but not for me.
I would only recommend this to a gin drinker."

4.0,"46% abv non-chill filtered , color added i believe.

i bought this not expecting much, but ended up with a pleasant surprise! i plan to revisit in a few weeks for i am slightly under the weather.

Nose: instantly greeted with pine and a great deal of ethanol. this worried me a bit because while i don't hate it, i am not a huge fan of pine.

Neat: not as pine-forward as i feared! immediately i taste the strong sherry influence that i know and love! followed by a bouquet of fruits thats i can't quite place. orange peel? pineapple? raisin? damn you congestion!

all in all, this is a solid irish whiskey with a fair price ($45 usd here in coachella) i can't wait to revisit this one!"
