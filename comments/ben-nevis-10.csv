4.0,had this along with a few other samples when I was in Scotland training with the royal Marines. we hiked Ben Nevis and got to tour the distillery. Absolutely lovely. I found the 10 year in particular to be fruity and with a small but noticeable hint of smoke. I would also recommend a few drops of water to really open up all the tastes

5.0,"A worked up appetite after walking along the ocean side docks is met at the door with alluring aromas of garlic biscuits and orange marmalade then fresh seafood; lobster, clams, scollops, haddock, with melted butter and sweet and briny tartar sauce for dipping. Leaving with some tiny baked fruit tarts the sea breezes greet us in the open. A feast of a mouthful. Toured the distillery in Fort William and was disappointed when there were no bottles of 10 available in the gift shop. Furthermore, I wasn’t able to locate any in bottle shops before leaving Scotland. But as fate would have it I located a dusty 10 state side. Thank you Hector McDram!"

4.0,"The scene: Fort William, nearly the summer solstice. Rain, twilight, haggis nachos at the pub. Enter this dram, picked because I hadn't even heard of it, and I could see Ben Nevis from our bed and breakfast, so I figured it was local. It was the highlight of my evening (beat the hell out of Oban), and I was heartbroken to discover upon getting back to the states that it's not widely available here. If I'd only known that before I boarded my flight...
      
      Fortunately, Masters of Malt sells it, so I added it on to my annual whisky Advent calendar purchase, along with Talisker Skye and a pack of miscellaneous samples. Ben Nevis is as good as I recall: rich, hefty, full of dark dried fruit, fig, chocolate, orange zest, ginger, clove, cardamom, and a tiny whiff of sweet pipe smoke on the finish. Please, for the love of God, somebody start importing this and selling it in Wisconsin!"

4.0,"Though its youth is quite apparent, this is a very nice and balanced whisky, with pleasant aromas of orange zest, dark chocolate, malted barley and clove (a generous dose of spice). The body is a tad light and the finish regretfully short, but all in all this is quite delicious."

4.0,"Stop number 78 on the Scottish Distillery Tour, and the last of the official samples for round 5, is Ben Nevis. I have no real info on this Highland distillery, but this is my first from them (a recurring theme during this little adventure). Bottled at 46% ABV and I am fairly certain it is non chill filtered and also fairly certain that there is colorant added making it a dark amber. 

Sweet fruits with a fair amount of sulfur are my initial impressions on the nose. Lots of berries, raspberries, blueberries and blackberry jam. Heavy sherry notes of honeyed dates and raisins. Slightly earthy with a distant nuttiness. Polished oak, cherry cordials, dark toffee and caramel with a slight coffee note. Orange pith, maple syrup, black licorice and a touch of mint 

The palate starts with a hit of medical and sulfuric notes behind a strong sweetness. Very fruity, mostly tropical in taste. Mango, oranges, blackberries. Milk and dark chocolate, black licorice and mint. More of those luscious mangos round it all out. 

Medium bodied mouthfeel that is mouth coating and a touch creamy. 
A medium long finish with sherry, blackberries and mango trailing on forever. 

This had real promise upon first nosing and tasting. Subsequent nosings and tastings revealed more of those sulfur notes and it put me off a little. There are really nice sherry and fruity notes in here that hint that there are casks much older than 10 years old at play here. I think that aging this another 2-4 years would do wonders. Would have been a 4 or 4.25 were those sulfur notes less prevalent. 3.75 it is. A big thanks to @Telex for the sample
Cheers"

4.0,"One more sample on this Friday night to counter my previous one.  This one sponsored by @Telex.  This is another Distillery that is foreign to me.  If it was not for a group like the tasting group I am fortunate to be a part of, I doubt I would ever sample a likes of a Ben Nevis. 

The nose is fruity and sweet. Caramel apples, strawberries, vanilla, honey, black tea, orange wedge, confectionery sugar.  Straight up fresh and lively. 

Sugary sweet on arrival. Orange drink, white pepper, toffee.  Semi-sweet bakers chocolate. Rough edges packaged in a light body. 

It finishes as Welches white grape juice, clove, ginger root that is not long lasting but not overly short either. 

This is a whisky that, though the underlying foundation is oranges, the sweetness and spice weave nicely through.  The some youthful nature provides some spirit (no pun...).  I do wonder, though, if given two to five more years, how much more improved could this be?  This is one the cusp of something more, given time.  All said, quite enjoyable. [87/100][Tasted: 3/2/18]"

4.0,"Another one as part of our distillery trading team, provided by my good friend @Telex.  I first feel as if I need to add a disclaimer:  I may have written two reviews back to back at 2pm EST but it doesn’t mean I was chugging whiskey during work hours in the office.  That would be insane,  I did it 8am, before starting work, and simply getting to the reviews now.  Anyway: my first Ben Nevis.  I’ve been saying “my first “ in these whiskey reviews often , like some pimply faced high school virgin...but yeah...I’ve had quite a few firsts in distilleries as part of our trading team.  One of the benefits of being in a trading team.  The other of course a regular supply of milk thistle.  Anyway, the review:  I  love the legs on this.  Long and lustrous. Silky smooth.  I can stare at those all evening.   For those of you who skip sentences while reading: we’re still talking about whiskey.  Aroma—-not much, but what it lacks in the aroma, it makes up in palette.  Honey, orchard fruits, citrus.  Yeah it’s good.  Need to put this baby on my purchase list.   Thanks Jason!"
4.0,"I found a little time for another tour group sample: this one from Highland distillery, Ben Nevis.  This is their flagship offering- the 10 year old.  This is also the first sample I’ve ever had from this distillery.  It was provided to me by my buddy, @Telex from Maryland.

This pour comes in at the ABV hot spot of 46% and is a light copper in the tasting glass.  It makes transparent, long legs and forms lazy droplets after settling back down.  The aromas stay pretty compact and you have to get down in the glass before they reveal themselves.

When they do finally release after 5-10 minutes they are some of the sweetest fruits I’ve had the privilege to try.  Honey-dipped berries and luscious chocolate-dipped orange wedges immediately come to mind.  They mask almost any cask note, though, and the dram doesn’t relay much of what’s to come on the palate.

The taste starts out kind of intense with pepper, spearmint and oak before settling down and letting go of it’s softer side:  malted barley, creamy toffee and more oranges.  There’s a solid burn as it’s going down which is the beginning of the faults I found:  the finish.

It’s loaded with bitter grapefruit, lemon rinds and loads more oranges.  It’s relatively short, which in this case, is probably a good thing.  The lack of time in the barrel hurts this dram- a lot.  This also would probably benefit from blending this one down to 40 or 43%.  I don’t usually suggest this, but this time I think it may help the overall profile.  The orange notes need to be reduced slightly and a bit of water would certainly calm the harshness, too.  I know what you’re thinking:  add water yourself, idiot!, but I don’t like to do that (especially with only a 2oz pour to sample from).  If I had the entire bottle I would definitely experiment with water and maybe even blending in some softer, Lowland style single malts.

Overall, it’s impressive for a 10 year old and the flavor profile is interesting enough to the point I’d like to find an older bottle or even a NAS and see what time or a little experimentation can lead to with Ben Nevis.  Distiller’s expert, Thijs Klaverstijn hit the nail on the head, though:  there’s an abundance of oranges in play here.  3.75 stars.  Thanks again for a solid pour, Jason.  Cheers, y’all."
3.5,"Caramel, honey, fruity, orange toffeeslight, some meatiness. Just let down by the shortish finish. Def a 3.5 maybe a 3.75. Price not the cheapest at nearly $70USD a bottle though. On VFM it could be rounded down to a 3 but it's better than that."
4.0,"This is an older bottle from 2015. Iodine and medicinal properties from the nose right off the bat. Toffee, orange pith, white grapes, and smoke show themselves as well. The palate brings toffee, caramel, sulfur, and oranges. A very interesting dram, and this is going to be a love it or hate it one. A nice alcohol burn with apple and dark chocolate/bitter espresso finish, medium mouth coat, and full of flavor. The theme of this dram needs to be old school and funky, maybe ""Get Up and Jump"" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. 3.75. If you don't like assertive bottles, maybe wait for a sample."
4.25,"Picked this up at The Whisky Exchange today on the back of the recent raves here and the initial tasting did not disappoint. Delicious nutty, jammy sherry flavors. Reminds me of nothing less than the 1980s Macallan 10 sample I shared with @PBMichiganWolverine a couple of weeks ago. I didn’t get any of the sulphur referenced by some people, so perhaps that was a characteristic of the 2017 batch that hasn’t carried over to the new stock. I will return to this bottle in coming days and see what other flavors I can tease out."
4.5,"Nose: Rich oily malt extract, a little hint of oak, treacle toffee, some lemon oil, dried orange rind and plum with a little bit of clove.  Huge, meaty, and sweaty - it's a cereal nose, but not light toasted grains or honeyed cereal  - this is big, expansive and more like porridge with treacle and butter. It's reminiscent of Hazelburn. As it rests in the glass it gains mineral and salt notes. Adding water unlocks aromas of freshly-squeezed orange juice, barley sugar, melon and hay. There is a sulphurous tinge, but it's the good sort of sulphur that adds body but not offensive aromas. [The dry glass smells of malt and soot].

Palate: A big, firm malty arrival with dense oaky tannins at the side. The texture is as oily as a grilled kipper. The development brings out some mild coffee, dark bitter chocolate, scorched almonds and an almost rancio walnut oil note. Balancing this is a spicy, heavy sweetness like blackstrap molasses. Some semi-sweet dried fruits (like dried kumquats or preserved lemon) give dryness to the palate. The addition of water totally transforms the palate by softening and bringing out much more gentle, honeyed sweetness and milk chocolate.

Finish: Long. Initially the palate flavours start to dwindle, then as the intensity dies down you sense subtle aftertastes of tobacco, bitter orange and faint brine. Adding water shortens the finish slightly, but in no way diminishes it's character.

A wonderful, engaging and rewarding malt that needs to be experienced both neat and with a half-teaspoon of water. Why is this not much better known?

Unfortunately it's hard to find now, but I strongly recommend picking up a bottle, if you can locate one. Lovers of anything Campbeltown, West Coast or Hebridean will take to this in an instant.

NOTE: The bottle shown on Distiller for this whisky is from the old bottling. Ben Nevis introduced a new bottle shape and label a couple of years ago and batches since that time have been consistently superior to the old expressions. The new bottle is more squat and the label features a large shiny red ""10"".

""Excellent"" : 4.5 stars."

4.5,"Nose very fresh and delicate, floral with balsamic touches (mint, even), accompanied by fruit (peach, apricot, apple) and cinnamon. Spice that opens in time to sherried hints, which gradually impose themselves with ripe plum, raisins in spirit, dark chocolate, a shade of coffee. Two souls that intertwine without stumbling, very interesting.
The alcohol content is optimal, it warms up without exceeding in the mouth letting the freshness of the aromas pamper the palate in a full and oily consistency, encouraging the spicy side (again cinnamon with a pinch of pepper) combined with a delicate caress of the wood. The balanced marriage between American and Spanish influences remains, with vanilla, chocolate, yellow fruit (even some pineapple), orange, plums and liquorice.
A rather long finish of orange, cinnamon, pepper, licorice and an impression of coffee.
What a masterful balance for such a young whisky! Now I understand the desperate search for a bottle by many, a valuable distillate that blends the barrels of maturation without any effort into a full and satisfying drink."

3.25,"A very almondy and young malt, with a 46%abv strength that i think could have spent a little two more years in a cask for a better offering. 

On the nose, Almonds, Chesnuts, some citrus notes coming up; First time i get this: cough syrup medicine made up from honey mixed with lemon. Here in Ecuador taxi drivers have this lemon car freshener, this is just like this. Caramel aromas develop after first sip. There is a bitter like aroma. 

On the palate, way too underdeveloped. Spicy mild. Burnt oak. Has character but it is mostly oaky spice. Cereal. Very bitter.

Aftertaste is the best part without been anything to die for. Burnt hay with a slight smokey and honey note. 

Overall i give this dram a 68 over 100."

4.0,"Ok firstly apologies to anyone I haven't responded to..comments and notifications are all over the place at the moment so I can't really track stuff.

Also as I'm struggling with app functionality its most likely that reviews here on in will be shorter and sweeter (until the app is more stable) which given Dramfest is around the cnr is a probably a good thing....anyhow onto  the dram.

Firstly thanks @cascode! I didn't realise but I had tried the dram previously but not too sure if new or older discontinued stock hence 2nd review. This is the older pre 2017 stock apparently. In summary very nice. Solid 3.75 to 4, viscous rich almost Mortlachy in a way. Ethanolly short finish detracts but definitely one to try."
