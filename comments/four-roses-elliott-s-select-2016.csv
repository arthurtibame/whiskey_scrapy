5.0,This is a great bourbon with no flaws. It coats your mouth with vanilla and oak. The finish is smooth and mellow begging you to take another drink.

4.0,Another fantastic limited release from Four Roses. The rating gets bumped down a bit though since many of the private selections I've had have been just as good or better for half the cost. The bourbon is top notch though.

4.0,"108 proof. Stupendous nose, rich caramel, honey, vanilla, herbs. Great spice on the tongue, nice mouthfeel. Cinnamon, apples, wood, dark chocolate. Mouth watering with a very long finish. Some sharp (good) flavors but this is well balanced. A credit to Brent Elliott. 6/16/17
    
  Still very good, but this has chanced with air time, and unfortunately to my palate, not for the better. There is a more noticeable bitter note on the palate and the other flavors seem more muted than before. Some might welcome this change but I liked it better the first few times I poured from this bottle. But again, still a very good bourbon. Very warm going down, deep Kentucky hug. 10/8/17"

5.0,"So good, just so good.  This is all Four Roses' OESK recipe, which is arguably the bourbon community's favorite variation.  Because of the use of multiple single barrels, the proof varied from bottle to bottle between 100 and 120 proof.  I'm not exactly sure the proof of the sample I tried, although judging by its lack of significant heat, I'd estimate it was in that 50-53% range rather than the higher end.  This is (or was, since it's no longer widely available in stores) a stunning bourbon, and the best I've had from Four Roses.  The nose exhibits the clarity and potency of flavor that comes only when everything -- distillation, aging, selection -- goes right.  Vanilla latte, coconut, strawberry, butterscotch, banana crepe, and oak all have their turn.  Then the palate turns to a rich breakfast spread:  maple syrup drizzled over vanilla french toast, banana caramel crepes, and a few flecks of chocolate (which I find to be a signature of the OESK recipe).  The age manifests as a sweet, lightly spicy oak that provides the frame for the other flavors.  Elliott's Select finishes with a balanced conclusion of oak, rye spice, peach, apricot, and honey.  This bourbon was $125 at retail, and multiples of that on the secondary market now.  If I'd had a chance to buy this at retail, I'd have purchased 2 or 3 bottles."

5.0,"Amazing, complex, visible sugar. Burns like hell at the end. I love it."
null,"This is an Earthy, gritty, mellow bourbon  - Carmel, coffee grounds, barley, stewed vegetables, cheesecake, - reminds me a little of a heavier, sweeter version of Woodward double oak."

5.0,"Great stuff with notes of caramel, vanilla, chocolate, floral, strawberries, cinnamon, cloves, cookie dough, and pepper."
3.0,Brown suger on the nose. Starts with light juniper with a burn spike in the middle tailing off to a rye spice finish. Complex with cinnamon and spice entering on multiple tastes. Doesn't match my pallette.
4.75,Wonderful.

4.5,"Very smooth and spicy, the oak flavor dominates the whole way through. Vanilla as well, but the wood overpowers it. Richness gives a long tail that the oak rides on as well. Super fiery, love it."
