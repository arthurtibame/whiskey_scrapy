5.0,"Inbetween the barbecued fruit of the recent 15 and the brute expression of the 18 lies this surprisingly smooth Laphroaig. A silky dram that is more typical of the distillery than the 15 but less challenging than the 10 or 18. Even for those of us who relish the challenge, it's a delight to see Laphroaig's more seductive side. Tasted at Chami Bar in Davos."
