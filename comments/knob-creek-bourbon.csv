3.5,They weren’t lying when they said it tastes like peanut butter. Nice full tasting 100 proof bourbon.

2.5,"First time trying 

Nose - cinnamon and oak is about all I get to the nose with a light ethanol burn

Taste - full and heavy, I get some caramel, leather, oak, and pepper at the end. The finish is rather hot with pepper.

Overall and value - 100 proof bourbon around 30 for a bottle. Not very complex. A bit spicy for my personal liking. Not a bottle I would want to keep in my collection."

4.0,Sweet on the nose leads with brown sugar. Taste is delicious. You definitely taste the corn and oak. Finish is nice and spicy. Hangs around a bit but not too long. This could be an excellent every day bourbon.

3.25,"Spice, nutmeg and cinnamon on the nose.  The palate had spice caramel and the finish was medium to long."
3.75,"Very interesting, in a good way! It really seems that each sip (with a good bit of time in between sips) is quite different! One drink you get citrusy-corn and the next is hot sugar. Will have to give this another go in the future."

3.5,"(Blind vs. Woodford Reserve) - This won by a nose due to finish and complexity.

Nose - Peanut butter immediately and roasted peanuts. A touch of dusty corn early.
More oak, more dusty corn as it opens, but peanut butter remains.

Oak, spice early in flavor with Undertones of peanuts early and a moment of perfume. More cocoa as it opens putting peanuts to the back for now. More floral and corn notes come out.  Deeper on  finish, which is nice as you take your time in the glass. 
At first I was neutral on adding the water..  But as time ticked, it was worth the 3 drops.  Finish eventually opened nicely and spice and nuttiness linger on your palate long after liquid is gone.     Head to head at a standard bar..(Knob, Maker's, Woodford only 3 choices) I know will say Knob Creek!"

3.25,At first I just got dusty corn and not much else. Wasn't impressed. Subsequent pours have been better - other bourbon notes coming through nicely.  At this time of writing I'd say it's very nice sub-$30 purchase.

4.75,"This bourbon needs more love. For the price of this bourbon it hits way above its price point. The nose is straight up peanut butter, to experience the nose itself is worth the purchase of this whiskey for sure. As you take a sip you get these flavors that hit you differently as you swallow, one second you're tasting caramel toffee, the next second your tasting sugared Wheaties, the next second you're tasting a hit of cherries, the next second you're tasting a bit of that wood. The aftertaste you get the slightest hit of the peanut butter and a nice alcohol burn. I definitely see myself buying another bottle of this!"

3.5,"The nose has all the classics you want in your bourbon; toffee, brown sugar, vanilla, and then citrus to lighten it all up.

The first sip is sweet initially, and then transitions into a smooth, oily and rich mid palate with more dark sugars and orange. 

Now on the finish the 100 proof begins to show up and you get that warmth and peppery spice you knew was coming but were worried might ghost you since it waited until now to make an appearance.

Classic is the best way to describe this bourbon, the flavours will remind you of others like Buffalo trace or Makers, but the higher proof adds some room for this to be a bit more interesting after each sip.

For the price it’s also a great value and should be a staple on the shelf. I bet it could even hold up to an ice cube on a hot day... maybe test that tomorrow."
