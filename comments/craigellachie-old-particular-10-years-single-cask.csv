3.75,"Nose: White wine notes, bananas and unripened strawberries. Dark fruit jam, cherries perhaps, with lemongrass. Sour notes from green apple and unsweetened lemon juice. Cinnamon is very prominent accompanied by nutty flavours, lightly salted cashew and a fresh earthy tone, light moss perhaps. Water brings out the lemon zest. 

Palate: intense nuttiness, a combination of walnut and pecans with very subtle almond paste. Honey and toasted barley are accompanied with leathery notes and tobacco. Lemon zest and hints of pineapple appear from beginning to end. Brief hints of tomato and oregano.

Finish: Tobacco lingers with lemon zest and pineapple, much more so than the palate."
