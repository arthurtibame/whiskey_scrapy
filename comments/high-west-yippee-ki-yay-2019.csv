3.75,Each bottle is a bit different.  Maybe different times in the vermouth barrels.  A bit too expensive
3.75,This was fun. Incredibly smooth. Maybe too smooth. The rye is subtle and you can definitely pick up the vermouth. I’ll pick one up if I can find it.

4.0,Nice!  It's a cherry bomb but well balanced with rye spice.

4.0,"Definitely get the red fruit and sweetness from the French Oak barrels, but the flavors didn’t have the depth I expected. A bit hollow when compared with MWND which I expected to be similar. Not as much spice as I anticipated either, especially given the mashbill. Still a tasty dram, but not at ~$80."
4.5,"Very sweet nose matched by a sweet palate. The vermouth and Syrah really shines through, along with brown sugar and a bit of pepper. The finish is long and moderately spicy, although I wish it was a little spicier to be honest. Very comparable dram to midwinters but not quite as complex or flavorful."

4.5,"I would recommend pouring this one in your glass and letting it sit for a few minutes. This helps to tone down the sweetness on the nose from the finishing process. The wine and vermouth were a bit overwhelming initially. I did enjoy this addition to the High West collection. The dram was quite nice as it evolved from the time I poured it until the final sip. It started very fruity, sweet, and almost cloying. By the end after some breath it was easier to notice the typical rye flavors. I will be keeping a bottle in my rotation. 
N - dark fruit, butter, vermouth 
P - sweet, apple, nutty, oak
F - short, crisp, and a lingering of what I can only describe as a resemblance of the sparkling grape juice we give the kids on New Year's Eve."
4.0,Rich. Nice finish.

3.25,"Sweet, spicy with a fruity nose"
3.75,"So I wanted to like this more than I did in the end. It has a unique nose, primarily from the vermouth of course, which I find slightly berry but also cough syrup medicinal. The flavor is nice up front with a decent mouthfeel but the finish is a bit tannic and left much to be desired. I’m a huge fan of HW Double Rye and the price of Yippee just left me all the more disappointed."

4.5,"I'm a fan of the Double Rye and the Rendezvous and I might like this just a little more.  The forward flavors hit the tongue slightly on the sweet side and then instantly disapate into an excellent balance of spice, sweet, and light citrus note.  The nose is citrus and honey. Beautiful."

4.25,"I really like this! The vermouth comes through on both the nose and the palate. Overlaying the sweet herbal notes is a solid rye with a good balance of spice and honey. Interesting, different, and delicious!"

4.0,Surprisingly smooth and very drinkable. Nice finish with a pleasant burn left in your mouth. This has become a favorite in my home.
4.0,"First sip was a bit harsh, but it quickly develops a well rounded vanilla and cinnamon sweetness with a long slow burn into the sunset."
