3.5,Smoky out front but not overwhelming. Young. Once the smoke passes hints of toffee/butterscotch. Enjoyed it and interested in other offerings from this still.

3.5,"First sample of a 7 part Kilchoman (custom) sample set my wife got me for my birthday. It was hard to choose which one(s) to start with, as I was very curious for all of them, I decided to go for the Travel Retail releases first. The Saligo Bay has pretty obvious smoke on the nose, but is more gently on the palate. Some fresh, citrusy notes appear shortly after the first sip, with some toffee, then some mild spices. Not a bad dram at all.
(I noticed I didn't post this review yet as it wasn't available in Distiller at the time, so here goes :) )"
