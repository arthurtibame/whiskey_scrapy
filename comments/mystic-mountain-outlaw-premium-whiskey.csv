3.75,"There is definitely a sweet, spiced nose with an overall smooth cinnamon roll kind of taste. The finish does not linger sweet, but almost more of a very light citrus note. Very drinkable. However for a sipper I want a little more complexity. 

Very good for the sale price of under 20 bucks! I found this in South Carolina, I have not seen it in North Carolina."
3.0,"Appearance: The color is darker than I’d expect as a tawny leather. The legs are extra thin, nearly nonexistent, and watery dribbling their way back into the rest of the whiskey at the bottom of the glass.
    
    Nose: The overall nose is very dessert-like. Notes of cinnamon, brown sugar, caramel, chocolate fudge, and dark cherry draw you in with a note of polyurethane varnish to balance out the sweet with some rough girth.
    
    Taste: The nose is a bit misleading as the palate doesn’t offer nearly as much as was being built up. However, the palate that’s there has notes of cream soda, orange, peach, and snickerdoodle cookies. There’s also a bitter taste I can’t quite put my finger on.
    
    Finish: The finish takes off from that strange bitter note in the taste and fades into the short-medium length finish with a citrusy and root beer tang.
    
    Thoughts: Overall, I like this whiskey. It has its moments where it’s tough and “spikey” and makes you feel like it’s putting hair on your chest. But other times it’s friendly and not challenging. It felt like the kind of something an outlaw might drink back in the old west. I may not buy it again, but I would happily drink it if offered to me! This would be a good going-camping-with-friends whiskey. Mystic Mountain, thanks for what you’re doing! Cheers!"
