3.75,"This was a hard find. Had to drive into BC Canada to dig up the last bottle at a Canadian liquor store. And it was well worth the hunt. Yes, its a Canadian whiskey, but don' let that fool you. This one was worth the trip.

The proof is 86, and this whiskey drinks very smoothly. It has subtle, sweet flavors that remind a bit of Japanese whiskey, but with vastly different tastes.

The nose is a mix of grapefruit, dried apricots, ginger and sweet icing. It has a playful decadent scent. The taste matches the smell closely, with added light musk, hints of dry-roasted hazelnuts, hot popcorn and a long note of licorice. Overall, pretty good and quite different."
