5.0,"Right off the nose, chocolate and nutty. First taste is sweet to the palate. After chewing, its spicy with a quick end to a mild nutty aftertaste. The more I drink the more I'm falling in love with it."

4.0,"I only had a small sample of this Taiwanese whisky after a co-worker shared some samples - reminded me a little of Irish-style whiskeys that use bourbon/sherry barrels like Black Bush or Tullimore Dew 12, but slightly smoother at significantly higher cost (~$90/bottle according to my co-worker). My rating does not account for cost (3 stars if price is considered)."
4.0,Sweet and nutty with the sherry being evident. I'd drink this straight mixing with a few drops gives a different aftertaste.

4.0,"Sweet, original, so many flavors. Definitely worth buying."
3.0,"Had side-by-side with the Kavalan Single Malt. This was a lot lighter, and I didn't prefer this one out of the two, but it wasn't bad."

4.0,"This is overpriced, but I'll grant that it's a fine whiskey, with some notes that don't usually happen in Old World single malts. There is aromatic cedar and sandalwood incense on the nose for me, along with tropical fruits and some herbal and woody notes. The palate is fruitier, with those tropical notes dancing alongside some coconut and dried fruit, with a bit of green grassiness. Interesting, complex, and unique."

3.5,"3rd Kalavan. Podium I gave a 3.75. This has a lovely candied orange bananas honeyish nose, and on the palate its it's a viscous drop. You do get a slight bitterness or sourness coming through accompanied by oakiness but the balance isn't too badly out of kilter with the rest of the honey caramel flavour. Although the more I drink it gets more prominent. Shortish afertaste. It's a hard one this one swings between a 3.5 and 3.75 I think"

3.0,"Full bodied, didn’t blow me away. Little spicy on the lips."
4.0,"You happen upon another survivor, and form a loose alliance. That is, until you find out they have a bottle of this in their zombie survival bag. 

Smells sweet fruit and vanilla, tastes of slight oak, vanilla, prunes, and a fourth flavor that I couldn't quite figure out. It's not overly complex, but it's smooth. Almost too easy to drink. 

The plan is to take their ammo and this bottle, then sneak away while they sleep. Yes, it is underhanded. But worth it."

3.0,"When i bought this one i really didn't know what to expect. I thought, ""it is a kavalan so it must be good"" but i also thought ""if it was good, they would name it Kavalan and not King Car"" (which is actually the name of the company that makes Kavalan). Well, all of those feelings come to life when nosing and tasting it. 

Bottled at 46%abv, tawny color.

On the nose is amazing and super interesting. Lots of notes and as time passes it gets better. Orange peel, Candy
Impalpable sugar, Citrus Artificial notes,
Coffee, Tangerine It surely opens up after a couple of minutes, to chocolate milk and coffee. Even floral notes appear. Caramel.
Everything is in here. Full score...

BUT....

On the palate is harsh. Tobbacco bitterness. bitter chocolate. Some oaky notes. Spiciness feel sulphuric like red chilli peppers. It is a harsh whisky. Almonds. Mostly bitter.

Aftertaste is very short with spicy oak notes. Chilli pepper. Not lovely.

Overall, the nose was great, the rest i don't feel the same way. My score for it is 62 over 100. It surely feels like more and it is not a bad dram, just not what you expect."
