0.5,This is offensive to all whisky. Tastes more like tequila. If you like whisky you probably won’t finish a glass.

3.0,"On the nose, sweet with a little bit of caramel and fruit. On the pallet light smoke and less complex but easy to drink. Good for someone who wants to try smokey whiskey without crashing into scotches."
1.0,"Quite the disappointment. The nose is for the most part smoky with hints of fruit (which for the life of me I cannot figure out because it's so tasteless), the palate falls flat without body, and the finish just isn't there. Picture  a blend of water, sugar and cigarette."

3.0,Intéressant avec un goût léger et quelque peu complex. Un note d'alchol un peu trop prononcée.
