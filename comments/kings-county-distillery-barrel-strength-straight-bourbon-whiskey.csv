4.5,"I had heard a lot about this Distillery. Once I was in NY on business I decided I had to see it and sample their Distillate. I have posted reviews of third other expressions ( all positive!) but asked to have this one added because it was special and the best of the bunch.
Before we get to the notes some of the technical details! 
Firstly it's important to note there is no Rye grain in the mash at all! It's 80% organic locally sourced corn.and 20% Malted barely. They used 5 gallon Casks to age the bourbon with a blend of 4-6 yr old juice (per the master distiller). The results are excellent!
On the pallette it's soft corn bread, butterscotch and Reece's! Mid pallette features burnt brown sugar, oak and tobacco. Finish is medium with oak and vanilla. It really is a lovely pour. For a craft Distillery it's close to a masterpiece! Cheers all!
Please note the price is for a 375ml bottle."

3.75,Nice and spicy! Boom.
2.5,"I was drawn to the minimal design of the bottle and hype from other local whisky enthusiasts. The dark color is unusual for a whisky only 3 years old, but this is likely due to the teeny tiny barrels this whisky is aged in. More complex than it is enjoyable, the palate is loud, drifting between sweet and savory. The prominent notes of baked pear, anise, and orange were nice, but lots of funky notes like crushed wet leaves distract from the dram. Opens up pleasantly with a little water or ice, but too much and it just tastes like barrel and leaves. Initially similar and pleasant like Balcone's Single Malt, but not quite as structured, still an interesting pour.

Aroma: Candied orange, caramel, dates, & warm leather
Flavor: Lime zest, baked pear, brown sugar, charred oak, overripe apple, & anise
Aftertaste: oak, honey graham, & damp vegetation
Body: Med-high & round"
4.75,"I decided to add it to a blind tasting of other full proof bourbons and was surprised that it won out.  Brown sugar and fruit on the nose with a long finish and notes of pear and cinnamon, long finish with reasonable burn.  I hope more people discover this one."
