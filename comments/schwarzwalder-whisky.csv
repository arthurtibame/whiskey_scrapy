2.5,"Local spirits can offer interesting variations in flavor, this one from a micro-distillery located in the Black Forest in Germany. Yeasty, slightly dusty and obviously young, the nose opens up with citrus and sour grapes, reminding of a semidry white wine. Arriving almost like a fruit brandy, the palate is oily and bitter-dry with an astringent floral touch. Was this whisky matured in ex-wine casks? Fairly hot around the edges, the finish is short and fresh with fading sourness and hints of wood bitter. A strange malt that tastes unlike anything I've tried before.
