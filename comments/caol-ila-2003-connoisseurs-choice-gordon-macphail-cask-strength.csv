4.5,"(This an exclusive bottling for Whic at cask strength with 73 bottles released.)

The nose opens up directly with amazing and intense fragrances of vanilla, butter cookies, butter and honey on warm toast, citrusy jam, créme brûlée - incredibly smooth and delicious, all amidst a really well placed peat. 

The palate hits very direct & strong and really delivers on what the nose introduced. It is as sweet and creamy as the nose promised. The peat is much more intense here. A medium strong peat with leather qualities and sun dried hay. 

The color is liquid gold and the finish long and citrusy with a bid of fruity smoke. 

What an incredible whisky. Rich, intense, well balanced, very complex and deep. This is what you drink on a warm summer evening after a hearty barbecue out at the lake ... well the Loch if possible. I want more of this. I will very likely try to get more. (Edit: I got more.)

Thank you @Der-Duesseldorfer again for all the amazing samples."
