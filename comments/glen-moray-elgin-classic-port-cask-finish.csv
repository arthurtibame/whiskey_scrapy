The port finish doesn’t seem to be as present on the pallet. There’s a mild dark chocolate note, which carries into the finish."

3.0,"I have to concur with the reviewer beneath me--three stars feels too low here, but four stars feels too high. For the price, though, I actually quite like this whisky, and there are tantalizing hints here of something truly great: an elusive hint of blueberry on a bed of almonds is the note that I keep searching for, but only rarely pokes its head out. When it does hit, though: glorious. Beautiful. Hints of berries and orchard fruits in the nose, barley sugar. Fruits in cream, green apple, slight sweet vanilla. Faint smoke on the taste (or so I'd swear, anyway, though I always thought Glen Moray was unpeated). More apples of all kinds--red and green and crab--and a surprisingly lovely creaminess. Sweet, nutty, slightly vinous. Shockingly full and mouth-coating given the low ABV, but (the below reviewer is correct) quite a surprising amount of heat as well. Some tongue-numbing white pepper, certainly, and a slightly off bile-ish character on the finish, with some lemon rind and soggy wood. Slight yeast or dough as well. For a $40, 40%, non-age stated bottle from an also-ran distiller, though, I'm honestly super impressed (slap an age statement on it, and give it craft presentation, and this could go toe-to-toe with some of the big names in scotch, frankly). I'll definitely be investigating the rest of the Glen Moray line-up."

3.0,"I really wish that half stars were a rating option here; 3 is too low, but 4 is too high. A very light body, medium-light gold with a hint of wine color from the port pipes. A bit of a muddled nose, but creamy, fruity notes are clearest. On the palate, this is quite creamy, with light fruit and a hint of richness coming in at the end. A pleasant, sweet note lingers. My only real complain is a lack of balance; it's just a bit too hot. That said, I gladly drink it."

4.0,"So, after working through a heavily oaked, bourbon-esque scotch it was time to move on to the next dram in tonight’s tasting:  Glen Moray Port Finished whisky.  This sample was provided by Scott from our distillery team.  It’s a NAS offering that spent 8 months in tawny port pipes from Spain.  It’s a standard 40% in ABV and is an oily, yellow gold in the Glencairn.

The nose is straight berries:  raspberries, blackberries and even a little blueberry in there.  There’s notes of caramel and vanilla chews and the faintest oak cask.  The palate releases all of those berries along with some creamy butterscotch.  The mouthfeel is rather thin and some harshness eventually sets in revealing the youth of the whisky, but it’s actually welcome and keeps this one from becoming a straight dessert dram.  The finish is too short, with little to none of the sweetness hanging out, but the oak barrel comes on and just reminds you that you’re drinking whisky.  So, I’d say it’s welcome.  This is a tasty little number that could get even better with healthier aged stock or a bump in the ABV, but it’s also fine as it is.

Thanks to Scott for sending this one.  It played well with the heavy, bourbon influenced Glenfiddich I drank along side it.  If I had more of this one I would’ve surely drank until my head punished me tomorrow.  3.75-4 stars because it’s a good value as well.  Cheers."
3.0,"Another instance I was praying to the TSA gods that they'd let me pass this through on my trip to Denver.  Thankfully, it worked.   So I maybe the outlier here, or it could've been the mile high Denver altitude, but I really liked this.  I got a warm blueberry cobbler on the nose, with a summery berry fruits on the palette. Short finish, with a kick of bitterness .  A  good Dram to share with friend who may not appreciate the complexity and gut kick of the Ardbegs and Lagavulins.  Solid 3.5.  Thanks Scott for the sample."
2.0,"Definitely getting port on the nose. Hmm, there is also some alcohol burn I detect, which is a little disheartening for a 40% ABV.  White grapes and butter cookies. Decent so far, so let's have a taste! Damn, that's hot for a 40%. The alcohol taste kinda obliterates the palate for me, which is really weird, because I love cask strength Islay whisky. Faint bitter dark chocolate, with even more bitter malt. There is some oak in there, but nothing else can come to the forefront. I am trying to find the blueberry in there that others have found, but it eludes me. The finish is just more alcohol, and a hot mess. Well, let's put a drop of water on it, just to give it a chance. Nope. This one is ""Let Down"" by Radiohead. Great song, but I'll just pass on this dram. Maybe it's just for those who like milder flavors. Thanks for the sample Scott!"

3.0,"Stop number 41 on the SDT is Glen Moray. This Speyside distillery was previously owned by Moët Hennessy/Louis Vuitton, which owns Glenmorangie and Ardbeg, but they dropped the brand as it didn't fit with their luxury profile. Glen Moray is now a part of La Martiniquaise, France's second largest spirits company. Ok, enough with the backstory now let's get to the good stuff. 

This NAS expression is bottled at 40% ABV, is most likely chill filtered, but appears to be a natural color (although a have no actual proof) of strawberry blonde. I have no idea of its age or of how long the port finishing process was.

The nose starts sweet with buttery croissants, strawberry Jolly Rancher candies and some port wine notes. Very sweet indeed. Honey, nutmeg and a little cinnamon & sugar. This is definitely a dessert dram. I get lemon squares dusted with powdered sugar and cocoa powder. Almond paste or marzipan comes and goes. This is like smelling a dessert table at a family holiday party. Some cinnamony oak in the background. A malty character shows up after a while. This is a great nose that is complex, although overall it is somewhat subdued and watered down. 

Spicier than expected on the palate given how sweet the nose was. A fair amount of oak and sweet port notes. Some blueberry/blackberry pie. Dark chocolate and a touch of ginger. Again, very good, but watered down and lacking in power. 

Light bodied mouthfeel that is thin and dry. 
Medium short finish that has port wine, almond paste and lemon candy. 

Scott did a masterful job in his review and I picked up on most of the same things he did with only a few differences. A big thanks to him for the sample he provided. This scotch is so close to being great. Everything is there, it just needs a higher ABV to carry it across the finish line. I love the nose, very pleasant if not a tad unbalanced from all the sweet notes. The palate is a bit thin and the finish is too short. 46-50% ABV would have made this a force to be reckoned with. Hell, I'd even take 43%. At around $25-30 you really are getting a great value for money. Without that low price I would give this a 3.5, but it's VFM factor gives it a boost to 3.75. I now had a very strong desire to try the 25 year port finished version!
Cheers 🥃"
2.0,"I pick this up for the Scotish Distillery Tour as I was interested in Glen Moray, never being privy to it prior.  The local spirit shop has several of the Glen Moray styles, aged and NAS, but I was curious about this particular bottling.  Mostly being intrigued by the Port finish.

A few soft rolls in the glass and some nosing and you are introduced to fruity aromas.  Fruit cocktail (like the Dole canned fruit cocktail) is what I am reminded and reminisce on first nosing.  A bit more time, and other fruity aromas of apples and dried pineapple come through.  Cereal notes come through with some banana (banana bread) over time.  A touch of leather can be detected and adds a touch of depth to the lightweight nose.

Like the nose, the mouthfeel is exrremly lightweight.  A slight zing of ginger wakes the palate.  Once past the zing, a sweeter side of the dram arrives with barley sugar, vanilla, honey and orange creamsicle.  A touch of blueberry, oddly, is detectable adding to the fruit nature.  The flavors on the palate are short lived.

As I would expect, a tinge of red wine-like notes arrive on the finish, though, again, rather faint.  The zing transforms itself from ginger to white pepper.  Some almond nuttiness and a bit of lemon citrus bitterness round out the short finish.

What comes through with this whisky is a sense that it has been watered down.  Like when you go to that dive bar and get a drink and the liquid in the bottles that was used has been added with water to stretch the length of the spirit.  The flavors want to burst and are on the cusp, but are restrained.  That could be because of worn out casks with little life left (pure speculation here, though).  All that said, it is not that terrible.  It is sweeter than I expected and has less wine influcence than I would have thought.  Overall, though, a bottle can be found for approximately $30 and I have had much worse for more money.  [82/100][$30][Tasted: 10/7/17]"

Presentation- wine glass. Water 

Color - light champagne

Nose - heavy alcohol, strawberries. 

Flavor - pepper and fire. A little berry. Light body. Finishes with some wood and biscuit. 

Overall - not my jam. Brother in law brought it, will drink in emergency. 

Rating - 55/100"

2.5,"Nose: Plum, wine notes and honey

Taste: sweet taste that reminds me a lot of a Irish whiskey.  A touch of the port wine flavor comes through briefly but doesn’t linger.  Tannins build moving toward the finish but most flavors disappear quickly.

Overall: I would call it palatable but best to be used in mixers.  Can easily fool an Irish whiskey drinker to believe its an Irish instead of a scotch.  Don’t want to down grade it much as not much was not thought to be much as I found a scotch for $10.99 but figured it was worth a try for the price.  Really enjoyed the port taste from the port finish just wish it would linger longer instead of coming and going immediately."

3.5,"not too peaty or smokey
bit of a harshness to the finish
overall drinkable but not my favorite"
2.0,"Nose: Faint red berries and tropical fruit salad with a piece of Turkish delight. A malty cereal backing with a little vanilla and caramel. Some oak notes. It's pleasant and fragrant but also a little wispy and retiring, and there's an intrusive ethanol presence. It's more like the nose of a fruity sherry-tinged blend than a malt.

Palate: A light arrival that turns spirity and hard in the development. Cereal is prominent on the palate but it's not malty and sweet - it's sour and more like burnt porridge. These sour notes eventually become quite bitter. The texture is light, dry and almost vodka-ish.

Finish: Short. Fino sherry, hot spiky tannin and bitter cocoa. There is a very faint wine note in the aftertaste.

The nose is the best part of this affordable malt but I would never have guessed from a blind tasting that it was port matured - it seems more like the influence of manzanilla casks. I  also won't be using it as a sipping whisky - the bottle is going straight onto the mixing spirits shelf along with the mid-tier blended scotches.

It's too hard and thin for my palate with an over-prominent ethanol profile. Water doesn't improve it - the good aspects become fainter and the negative ones get worse. Only cola can save this stuff, and does so by balancing out the hard, bitter characteristics quite successfully.

None of the cheaper Glen Moray wood-finished whiskies has impressed me much. The more expensive age-statement wood-finished expressions are a different story, but if you're looking at their affordable bottom tier stuff then I'd recommend sticking with the basic Glen Moray Elgin Classic, which is very good value, and give this one a miss.

""Acceptable"" : 2 stars"

3.25,"I was already somewhat a fan of the Glen Moray Elgin Classic as a non-peated, non-sherried Scotch that was pretty tasty and at a moderate price. The port finish adds another softer, slightly sweeter accent to this profile. I like it. It is not very complex and does not require much thought; but it is tasty and a treat at $23."

2.25,"Another aggressive, loudly youthful and unpolished scotch from Glen Moray. I like the port quality, but it’s heavy perverted by the exbourbon casks. This reminds me of the Tullamore green label. So I can pay $5 a bottle more to get a rougher version of Irish whisky? I’ll pass. It needs a better distillation if it’s going to succeed as a younger scotch . And let’s tone back the bourbon influence."
