3.25,"Some serious heat up front then mellows into a sweet side of corn and clove. I like it, but not for the price."

4.25,I haven't seen this one for sale in stores. Had it while waiting for a table at McCormick and Schmicks in Kansas City one night. Maybe the most aromatic Bookers I've  come across. Nice vanilla and spice flavor and smooth but short finish. Very good.
4.5,"Nose: caramel 
Palate: fruity and oaky and rich
Finish: medium"
4.75,"Per the usual Bookers, the color is a nice medium amber.  Straight out of the bottle the nose is a little bit astringent. When  allowed to rest for a minute notes of oak and toffee come out.  There may also be a bit of bitter orange and some leather in there.

The palate is rich and warm.  It is incredibly smooth on the front end with lots of mid pallet space and some burn going down. Toffee, butter scotch and tobacco predominate with a delicious dose of spice to balance it out.  Another sip and the toasted oak becomes very apparent rather than being overpowering in anyway seems to be balanced with the other flavors. The finish is long and sweet with caramel and apple pie flavors coming to mind. The heat sticks around as a mild linger and is enjoyable after the third sip.

This is a whiskey that has begs you to drink more of it and see what other flavors come out of it. With the surge of craft distilleries, overpriced allocated bottles and other  me-too Bourbon showing up in the market for $70-80 this is still a true standout (and thank God still on most every shelf).  

Rich, rich, rich.  I love this whiskey."

4.5,"Had the last pour.
very oxidize. flavor mute.
Not much if anything but a comfortable smell of old wet oak on the nose.
Oaky and honey on the palate. Fantastic, very smooth for being a +64%.
If I found this bottle at a bar or in the wild again, would buy!"

4.25,"Kathleen's Batch is nearly gone so this has been opened. Forgot to add it to the Collection list . Like most Booker's, it is simply a cut above. Will come back in a bit with a proper review."
4.25,"Nose is sweet corn, some caramel & toffee with a warm, but not burnt old leather. Getting vanilla, slight fruit and some spice on the palate & a good thorough warm finish that lasts awhile, but is not unwelcome."

4.5,Little hot but once the ice melts it’s incredible
4.5,Fantastic. Similar drag to that of GTS.
3.5,"Strong ethanol without water, but adding water only distracts from the taste without opening up much flavor.

Nose: heavy ethanol and sweet
Taste: clean wood with ethanol, sweet fruits
Finish: spice, lingers on the gums"
