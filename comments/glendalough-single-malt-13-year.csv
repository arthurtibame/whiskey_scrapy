0.5,"It’s not good. The floral is weird, there’s almost no flavor, and the flavor there is is not good, it’s just bad."
2.5,"Grainy, some fruit with a nutty and oaky flavor that lingers too long. With water it balances out a bit with earlier nuttiness and adding some more of a butter cookie note."
3.5,"All a little soft but quite pleasant.

It can take lots of water and it’s worth stretching out.
Takes a long time to open up. 15-20min

Nose:
Pretty candy barley 
Background musk sticks
Light tropical fruit
Tinned pineapple 

Arrival:
Woody vanilla
Apple mint 
Fine white pepper
Fresh cut grass 

Development:
White tea
Dried mango
Juniper berry 
Spiced mead

Finish:
Light menthol
Horse radish 
Herbal aniseed leaf

I got this one on special for around $80 aus, very much worth getting at that price but there’s a lot of better malts for $150."

3.0,"Had trouble identifying much on the nose. Maybe a bit of raisin. On the palate, I get more raisin, green apples, and a citrusy finish. I do agree that the finish is bitter. I’m liking the 46% Irish trend that’s been happening."

4.25,"vanilla, almost banana slight sweetness"
4.0,"Overall delightful, the middle has a weird snap pea flavor probably derived from the Japanese barrels."
4.0,"The first Irish whiskey release to be finished in Mizunara Japanese oak barrels. The initial maturation period was spent in American oak Bourbon barrel and the result is a citrus, honeycomb, apricot and spice flavour laden whiskey with a touch of creaminess and vanilla from the Japanese oak.

No. 18 in the World's Top 20 Whiskeys by Whisky Advocate in 2018.

Nose: Vanilla ice cream, toffee, orange, pine.
Taste: Quite nutty and chocolate, floral.
Finish: Notes of coffee bean and honey linger.
