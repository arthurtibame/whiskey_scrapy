3.75,"I will now start a series of reviews for a series of whiskies that are the core malts for Ballantine's. Basically, i am talking about 3 whiskies, but in this case, they will all be 15yo expressions, which are hitting the markets this year. 

Miltonduff 15yo, is a speyside malt, and its new label clearly says: ""Ballantine's single malts"" in order to relate that best selling whisky with this little known distilleries. 

Bottled at 40% abv.

The nose is standard, clean. Caramel, Coffee, Vanilla, wet grass, Floral and Fresh fields.

Palate is a little watery. Chocolate, Pepper. Maybe some orange.

Aftertaste has mostly a pleasant spiciness. Wasabi, Pepper, Tobacco.

Overall this is a normal dram, easy drinkable and suitable for begginers. 78 over 100."
