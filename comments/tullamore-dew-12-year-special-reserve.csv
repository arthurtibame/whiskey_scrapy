3.0,"whsikyen har en Duft av vanilje men har realtivt lite punch. 
Smaken er Smooth som en fjellbekk, med hint av cherry, nøtter, lett vanilje og har en mild rund finish! Dette er en perfekt introduksjons whisky for en som vill lære seg å elske den hellige eliksir. Den pakker alikevel for lite punch og kompleksitet til å nå helt opp. Men for all del en herlig whisky."

3.0,"Quite smooth and easy to drink. To me, the nose is both nutty and citrusy. The taste is rich with sherry, spice, and creamy vanilla. The finish is long and all of the flavors linger on the palate. This normally sells for $60 in the stores near me. It's good and definitely has a unique taste compared to anything else I've tried thus far."

4.0,"Still watching the Mets @ Vaughans and working this dram. The nose is more bourbon traits than Irish whiskey.  The arrival is soft; one of the softest drams that I can recall.  Rich vanilla-honey sweetness fills the palate.  Some oakiness comes through after the sweetness subsides. The mouth is left dry and a skosh spicy; cinnamon and walnuty.  Stephanie's review is right on and on par with what I experienced.  A lovely, sweet whiskey. #LGM. [88/100][Tasted: 10/15/15 @ Vaughans, Hartford]"

null,"This a phenomenal, smooth 12 year old Whiskey. Great for sipping on the rocks."
3.0,"Not a bad little Irish blend; it reminds me of a much lighter Jameson Black Barrel (which makes sense, since Tullamore currently sources from Jame-o). Bit of apples, tropical fruit, just enough yeasty pot still funk to be interesting. Sweet, hay/grass. Vanilla, slight nuttiness. But all very mild. It's a quiet, relaxing whiskey--very sippable, very ""more-ish,"" even if it's not setting the world on fire for complexity or big flavours."

The sherry notes show up at the very end, but aren't a dominant figure in the taste profile."

3.0,"[Whisky Live Paris 2015] Same classic traits from the stanard offering, however they are pushed towards the background to allow for a little extra oakey woodiness.  Certainly bourbon spice and sherry influences, however the texture takes on attributes of American oak rather than the Spanish.  I wouldn't really call it a step up as I would call it a side step into different territory from old Tully."

3.0,"Because you have to celebrate St. Patrick's Day properly...

I picked up this bottle tonight to be all proper.  I've had the regular NAS Tullamore Dew, so I felt this was appropriate and relatively cheap to add a new Irish whiskey to my portfolio.  This bottle comes in at the standard 40% ABV and is a beautiful, golden yellow in the tasting glass.  It makes lots of long, skinny legs when you spin it.

On the nose there's a good bit of vanilla and oak tannins.  It's kind of shallow and taking in a big whiff doesn't add anything nor does it give off any heat.  Ehh.

The palate is ridiculously soft with tons of vanilla and a bit of malty sweetness.  Again, nothing too harsh or unexpected.  The finish is light and quick, making this a totally boring dram.  It's as non-offending as an Irish whiskey comes and that makes it crushable on any given day, especially on this Irish holiday.

Happy St. Patrick's Day and cheers my Distiller friends.  Stay safe and get sauced!"

Again, I'm a sucker for those whiskeys partially aged in a sherry cask. This is fruity and light, even pale in color. If I didn't know better, I'd swear this was fermented from honey itself. This is a dangerously easy drinker with a smooth and fair malt flavor followed by a nutty, floury aftertaste."

The bed and breakfast has fresh baked biscuits and an assortment of jams and preserves, you decide to try them all.

2.5,"The nose is warm, sweet, heavy sherry with some wine-ish hints, but a bit sharp and “thin” because of strongly marked spiritous notes. Definitely raspberry or even raspberry fruit-drink as well.
The sweetness in the taste is truly overwhelming, it’s nutty, rich with creamy vanilla but again - a bit sharp with pure alcohol notes and bitter on a palate. Some fruits, spices, even watermelon too.
It possesses the same structure to the original Tullamore Dew - it’s sharp, poorly balanced, spiritous but now with a gentle touch of elegance and mildness which probably the 12 y.o. maturation in old bourbon and oloroso sherry oak casks gives to a whiskey.
Aftertaste is decent but nothing more than that. Some nuts on the tongue, dry oak on a palate.
Very easy-drinking whiskey but not the one to truly appreciate."

The higher concentration of pot still and single malt is apparent by how much richer and fuller bodied it is vs the lower DEWs. The time in the barrels really shows up on the pallet too. Instead of refilling The Crock with  this one, I had to break tradition. I couldn’t bring myself to dilute this with the lesser Tullys (I never let the crock get less than about 1/5 full) so only spiked it with a full pour of this and will do the same with the 14 year, so as to bring the overall blend up."

3.75,"A nice fruity likeable whiskey. First opened under a metal roofed pavilion in a flash rainstorm at twilight. Very small tasting pour to start with and glad of it, since the gnats seemed to love it exclusively and left other folks drinks (red wine) alone. Only managed two quick sips before my least favorite protein source started their swim session.  Oh well, tomorrow is always another day.

Have decided to take on the cigar experience after 34 years without anything tobacco. I can now say that any decent 92pt. Rocky Patel robusto  goes very well with the D.E.W. The sweetness of the whiskey makes for a smooth combination with the milder cigars I have on hand. Sitting outside on the backyard glider aligned 90* to the wind makes for a very nice experience and keeps the clothing fresh. Apparently the neighbors (all friends) have taken notice and will be joining in soon. 

At 67 now and truly retired, I find it's the little pleasures that satisfy most. And in that vein I can say that sipping a blended 12 year old Irish with good mouthfeel, taste and mild burn at 80 proof is one of them. Life is not only good, it's getting better all the time (cue the Beatles)."

4.0,"Ah, Tully 12. Often overlooked in favor of Redbreast 12 and Green Spot at the price point. That'll happen when the lion's share of your distillery's sales come in the form of a cheap, borderline mixer NAS blend. Let's see if 12 years in the barrel can elevate Tully's status beyond that of a dive bar/college party classic.

Nose: Sweet and buttery. Red/purple grape and grape jam. Butterscotch, vanilla, toffee, and shortbread cookie. Orange candy and some raisin from the sherry cask. There's also walnut and almond, rounded out with an oak note. Even a bit of honeydew. Solid nose.

Palate: More of the grape, jam, raisin notes. Now accompanied by juicy plum; the sherry influence is more prevalent here than on the nose. Mlik chocolate, vanilla, and orange-citrus. Toffee and butterscotch carry over from the nose, as well as the walnut and almond, now accompanied by hazelnut. Just a touch oak. Awesome palate. This one really shines here.

Finish: Out of the gate, it's more of the classic Irish shortbread cookie. A touch of powdered sugar before a burst of cinnamon, pepper, and baking spices. Oak as well. Moderate length, which is surprising for a 40% ABV.

This is really good stuff. It's a shame it gets overlooked. I prefer the likes of Knappogue Castle 14 and Redbreast 12 at this price point, and I think it's on par with Green Spot. (I'm back to this a year later and I'm rethinking that. Green Spot might be better--but it this is a 40%er and it's the final pour--it's reasonable to assume oxidation would take a toll here). It's worthy of being in the discussion with any of the above, and that's great company to keep. The cream of the crop Irish that even hang with some of the big boys coming out of Scotland.

At $55, I'm more than satisfied with my purchase. This could be a real juggernaut bottled at 43-46%. At any rate, this is an impressive whiskey as is. A job well-done, Tully."
