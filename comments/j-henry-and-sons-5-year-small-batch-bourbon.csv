      Sampled from Bender's stock (Batch 5/Bottle 73)."

4.0,"We're prepping for our move to rural southwestern Wisconsin over the summer; it'll be a big shift, from life in a small apartment on the Northwest Side of Chicago to living on a micro farm outside of a small town. A good change in many ways, but a big one just the same. I decided to prep my palate by trying out the most well-regarded Wisconsin whiskey, produced within an hour or so of where we'll be living. The nose is immediate - this is a really fresh, crisp caramel covered apple sprinkled lightly with spice. Vanilla comes in next. The palate is remarkably smooth for only being a five year old bourbon; lush and buttery, with dulce de leche, apple, corn pops cereal, vanilla, a hint of cinnamon, and a dark chocolate dusted finish. If life in Wisconsin is as good as this bourbon, we're in for a great time!"

5.0,Excellent
4.0,Really like this one.  Great balance and flavor with just a little warmth.  Highly recommend.
5.0,"Swirl the whiskey in the glass and check out the deep orangish amber. Nosing it brings an aroma of chocolate, toffee, caramel and a hint of sweet fruit. 
Lifting to the lips introduces custard, crème brulé, brioche, orange and toffee that spreads over the palate. Then, the custard swings back again to give a long, lasting finish.

This is the best Bourbon you've never heard of! Cheers!"

4.0,"The red heirloom corn is only grown by them and only used for their bourbon! The taste is sweet, rich corn which makes sense as 60% of the mash is corn. Even the aftertaste is a satisfying mellow corn."

4.75,Love this one. I saw a segment about J Henry on PBS and it’s a very charming operation. My only wish is that it was a little bit cheaper. As it is now it will have to be an occasional treat. Definitely worth trying.
4.75,I can’t say go badgers but I can say go j. henry

3.5,"Refined corn nose, mixed with, I wanna say apples, prairie wind, and a little caramel. I dont know how to sort out the rest except to say it's quite unique and pretty good. Definitely worth a buy, should you be passing through the fine state of WI."

4.0,Smooth. Slightly briny. Nice finish.
3.5,"Not outstanding, but pretty enjoyable overall.  Has a slightly funky cherry, vanilla, and oat flavor that I seem to find in a number of craft distillery bourbons... not sure where that comes from, but it’s distinctive."
