3.75,Great flavor. Great value.
4.0,"Easy drinker, very smooth, thin, and soft..Honeysuckle, apple nose. Slightly sweet and tart.  There's a beam-like nuttiness, cinnamon on the tongue..very slight bubblegum. In the same flavor family as Beam High Rye (Basil Hayden, OGD). I doubt many would notice if you filled an empty Basil bottle with this.

Stupid good value and tragically hard to find"

4.25,"I give it bonus points for the price point of about $20 for 1.75L. This is a very classic Bourbon if you can find it. Apparently it's more available in KY and TN. It's rare in VA where I bought it. Great nose, some dark fruit and vanilla sweetness. I think it's the best value Bourbon on the market, definitely a table Bourbon that is good neat as well as mixed."
3.0,"A solid sipper for the price.   Brown sugar,  cinnamon apples, and leather.  20$ for 1.75L here in Texas.   Great value and you won’t freak out if someone dumps it in a Coke."
4.25,Best value in bourbon I have found.

3.5,"Always been curious about this low shelf whiskey.
The nose is very smokey with freshly baked bread with a subtle fruit note.
The palate is nice and oily, was not expecting that. I get corn, some of those baking spices and smokey notes from the nose. Not too sweet. 
The finish is on the shorter side of medium, and there’s nothing wrong with it.

Because this one is only 86 proof, I had to really dig in on the nose and palate, but it’s good. For how cheap it is, it’s really pretty good. No harshness. Definitely on Th younger side, which is to be expected."
4.0,"Nose: ethanol and maple syrup. Almost like a Canadian whisky aroma
Palate: creamier than the 80 proofed brother. Not as much flavor as the 100 proofed though but this is still such a solid bourbon to me. So smooth and sweet 
Finish: small amounts of caramel and vanilla but the maple syrupness is there all 
the way through

$23 for a half gallon"

3.5,Not to shabby
3.5,Smooth with a good mouth feel. Fairly strong tannins but over-all very good bourbon for the price.

3.75,"A good everyday sipper and a great cocktail choice. Definitely can't be beat for the price! Make sure to get this instead of the 80 proof, the 6 extra proof makes a big difference."
3.25,Solid everyday bourbon ! Pretty similar to the 1792’s small batch stuff and BiB flavor profile wise. It’s a steal for $18.99 a 1.75
3.25,Simple. Straightforward. Not complex. Would do in a pinch. Seems like it might mix well with clear sodas.

3.25,Pretty spicy at end while having a very light body. Somewhat sweet at beginning. Probably pretty young since no age statement. Cheap at $11 a bottle. Light gold in color. Hard to tell if it’s a good staple.

3.0,Asked liquor store for something cheap yet tasty and they recommended this. For $13 it delivers on taste and budget
4.0,"Raisins, toffee, Oak, and leather produce a classic bourbon nose overall, followed by tangy citrus and caramel on the palate, with a smoldering warmth down the throat on the finish. I wouldn’t call it a burn, but there’s a gentle heat that’s just right. Easy bottle to grab for a killer couch pour, great value, and it’ll likely be pitted against some stuff competition in my next tasting with friends."
3.75,"Candy corn, maple and baking spices make up the nose on this super affordable starter bourbon from Bartons.  Simple corn and wonderful oak finish off this great everyday offering with minimal burn."

3.25,"First things first, the $23.99 price is for the 1.75L bottle at VA ABC stores. This is another bottom shelf “unicorn”. Buy it when you can find it. I have seen it compared to Basil Hayden’s and, to a point, I see the similarities. There is a nice balance of sweetness and rye spice. This one is a little more astringent than Basil’s. Still, for the price, this is a very pleasant sipping bourbon."
3.0,"I made a review of this in fall 2018 under the 100 proof bottle.  Now that someone has requested the 86 proof that is available in NC, I moved it here.  Fairly good whiskey.  A bit too much alcohol on the nose, and in the mouth. Not very complex, but no off notes or rot-gut flavors.  A splash of water brought out sweetness and softened up the finish.  I certainly recommend this with chilled water.  This is by far a better pour for $11.95 a bottle than anything else I have tried.  Give it a try."

3.25,"Golden straw in color, speedy legs.
Sweet Corn, barnyard, dry oak and barrel char and a bit of burn hints of currants and tart berries.  Some light caramel.
Softer than I expected, but finish is hot and fast. Sweet. Nothing unexpected, outside faint notes of mint and eucalyptus. 
A bit flat on the palate and not very complex, but this is an incredible value at $23.99 for a 1.75."

2.25,"Nose is light only at first glance, and then corn, and nothing but corn. The sweet smell gives way to just a bit of oak, but no char or smokiness abound. Low proof delivers the obvious downfall of no cask flavors upon tasting, which is a shame because I can tell this would be well enhanced at a higher proof. There are small bits and pieces of flavor profiles bouncing around, but all is overwhelmed by the corn. Sweetness does in fact blend into some smoky cask, but it's very subtle and gives way to the corn yet again for the finish, with a small oak sidecar. I can see now why this is popular; this is a clear winner for those who protest the wheated whiskeys and bourbons to the point of wanting the opposite end of the spectrum. Plus, it's dirt cheap, and that's what everyone seems to want. I can't really see the appeal to it, but more importantly, I'm finding it very hard to distinguish against other bottom shelf bourbons of the like, and that's why I have to rate it as such."

3.0,It was suggested to me at the store. Not bad for a 12.95 bottle. Lacks some of the depth you find in some bourbons but interesting none the less. Will keep in the bar but not the first choice.
2.5,Decent bourbon for the price. 1.75L at $21.99 Daily sipper but nothing overwhelming special.

4.0,"Yes, Four stars!

Nose- toffee, salted caramel, sweet berries and chocolate.

Palate- first hint of vanilla with a rush of cinnamon that lingers then back to a hint of vanilla. Definitely not what I was expecting.

Finish- much longer than expected  and it kept me wanting more!

At $11.99 a bottle this was definitely a unicorn of a find! My local ABC store had these labeled 1 per customer due limited quantities and difficulty in getting them. I'm very impressed in how good this bourbon was at the price point."
4.0,"Nose is banana, honey, vanilla and black pepper. Taste is watery and mild. Leads with a light honey sweetness and a little cherry flavor, hint of black pepper on the very back end...not getting much bitterness. Hard to pick out a whole lot of flavor with the watery character of this one. Palate has a lingering black pepper note that lasts for a medium length of time."

2.75,"Decided to pick this bottle up to see what its like. 20 bucks for a 1.75? Why not.

Color: Light amber, gold
Nose: Sweet fruit like banana, apple and some cherry
Palate: Light banana and a hint of vanilla and caramel, watery, not much depth at all
Finish: some residual burn, tingly, dissipates quickly.

Overall: For a 20 dollar handle, it's really not awful just not much to it. There are definitely better bottles of whiskey for that price range that I would gravitate towards like EW Black and White Label and Old Bardstown. I think it would make some tasty cocktails as well!"
