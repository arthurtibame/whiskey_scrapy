null,"This IS interesting. I'm not sure it's a 90 for me, but it certainly is a unique effort that pays off in a good way - and this coming from someone who views flavored whiskey with extreme skepticism. It's a fine rye... that happens to have honey throughout, especially on the finish. Amusing and rather delightful, like pulling honeysuckle blossoms off the vine and licking the ends while swigging an adult beverage. That said, drinking a full 2oz without cutting it ended up a bit too sweet. But I think if you dumped a shot of this into champagne or properly sour lemonade you'd have heaven. Even an ice cube might be enough to tip the scales. Going to go try that now, excuse me..."
