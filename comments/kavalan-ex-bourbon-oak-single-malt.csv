4.0,"First taste is strong on sweetness a bit of Carmel, long lasting spice throughout. Add a drop of water and its amazing how it opens up and turns into a mild, almost citrus finish."

3.0,Not as much of a knock-ut punch as its cask-strength cousin. Still delicious but lacking the intensity and shorter on the finish. But would gladly buy again.

4.0,"Nose - Tropical Tahitian vanilla, very floral, toasted coconut, plantain sweet.
Taste - Tropical fruits, hint of vanilla/caramel, lightly drying yet refreshing oak, similar to a ""dry cola"", white pepper spice/heat, coconut milk creaminess, light banana/peach sweetness.
Finish - Coconut milk creaminess lingers long, white pepper spice is still present, tropical fruit sweetness stays there and transitions to a lightly drying mouthfeel.
Score - 89/100
Final Thoughts - Bourbon barrel influence can be seen in this one with the heavy vanilla and oak influence on what I take to be a nice tropical malt. Floral notes and tropical fruits are present throughout along with the white pepper kick I get, which probably gets some help from the proof too. Overall quite tasty although I think I'd like the tropical fruit to shine through a bit more against the vanilla/oak from the bourbon barrels."
4.0,"A delicious whisky with a nose that has hints of coffee, unripe apples (though I wouldn't necessarily describe it as fruity), faint smoke and at certain whiffs an undetectable presence of oak. The palate is outstanding, with granulated brown sugar, nuttiness and spice, and vanilla, as if you were putting all these ingredients together and whisking them in a bowl while baking. The finish is quite long, with a mouthfeel that is pleasantly bitter and anaesthesizing."
2.0,"Nippy Sweetie sample - the oak comes through really strongly, almost overpowering masking the other subtleties.  It's a shame this one has been brought down from cask strength actually as it doesn't leave you much to play with to eke out the nuances.

Would not invest in a whole bottle but happy to have tried"

3.0,Had this just after a shot of the sherry oak and this is much better and the oak is strong in this one and the finish is ok.
4.0,"My favorite member of the Kavalan family, this is the perfect marriage of their signature malt notes with cask selection. The classic bourbon/American oak notes are there in all their beautiful glory - sweet vanilla and coconut, plus banana cream, tropical fruit, and a dry oaky woodiness. Palate is light, clean, and focused, with fruit and creamy vanilla, but it's not so sweet as to seem dessert-like. Really well done!"

4.25,"So you find yourself squared off against 10 zombies, and in the middle of this high noon showdown is this bottle. You'll want to put them all down before they trample this into the earth and maul your face.

Think Balvenie 14, but less malty. Fair amount of heat, but those fruit notes shine. Overpriced? Yes. But very good. Seriously, just put them all down, grab the bottle, and get out of there before more show up."

3.25,"Nose - citrus fruits with a musty touch of oak.  Fresh and refreshing, bright and very clear yet sharp and a bit acidic.  

Taste - Vanilla, vanilla yogurt, and vanilla icing.  Light citrus, almost an orange bitter.  Some light oak bitterness as well.  

Wow this is dessert with a long lingering oak and vanilla finish.  

Just a really high quality malt.  I've seen this in fancy boxes and as low as 100, but I paid 150 and I got the cheap cardboard box."
4.0,"Kavalan has always been a mixed bag for me. One not great (TWE single cask strength sherry) one awesome (ltd run Soloist sherry cask)...and the rest slightly on or above average in the 3.5 to 3.75 range. This one I really like.  With a few drops of water sweet toasted vanila coconut banana are the predominant and pretty much only characteristics. It's well balanced, short dry but only slightly bitter aftertaste. I could definitely drink a fair bit of this given I'm a sucker for first full whiskey offerings which I suspect this is in whole or part. Fair price at $90 USD. If it had a better aftertaste itd be up to the 4.25 range."

2.0,"I'll keep this one fairly short... Is this an acceptable dram? Sure, it was pleasant... Had some really pleasant wood spice that offset the malt notes... Would I pay more than $40 for a bottle? Absolutely not. For a contrast the Glenfiddich 14 is leaps and bounds better IMO. There may be some exceptional Kavalan out there, but this is not it!

Cheers All!"
4.5,"Nose: Strong banana and coconut shading to oak, tea and apple.

Palate: Honey, caramel, menthol and banana, rising oak, pepper fades in at end.

Finish: Drying wood with faint honey lingering on top."
