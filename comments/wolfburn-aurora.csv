2.0,Not a lot to it.
3.0,"Nose: full bodied, sweet, oak, butter, hints of smoke

Palate: vanilla, oak, and smoke. Not overly complex. 

It's a fair enough dram. Enjoyable on occasion for something different in the shelf but not a daily drink. Rated at a C."

3.5,"Wolfburn Masterclass at The Oak Barrel, Sydney, May 30th 2019: Whisky #2

Nose: A similar nose to the Northland expression - fruity and floral but substituting a sherry and dark fruit note for the musky hint. Well integrated, rounded and creamy with a touch of marmalade. The sherry stays well controlled and acts more like a spice for the fruity distillate rather than striding to centre stage.

Palate: A smoother, silkier and sweeter arrival than the Northland. The spicy burst is again present but here it is buffered by sherry. The texture is a little more rounded and overall this is less vibrantly bright than the all-quarter cask Northland. There is a little brine towards the conclusion.

Finish: Medium. Spicy sweet with an umami touch, and tailing off into an ever so faintly sweet cereal finish.

The maturation here is in a combination of 1st-fill ex-bourbon barrels and 1st-fill oloroso hogsheads. (Note - this is different to the cask regime stated in the description on this site, but it's correct. There is no quarter-cask component in contemporary Aurora). The whiskies are matured separately and then married in a ratio of 80% bourbon to 20% sherry.

The more flavourful and active cask maturation gives this whisky a larger and fruiter presence, and to me it was different but equal in quality to the Northland expression. Northland allows the excellent Wolfburn new-make to be seen in all its naked glory, whereas here the sherry presence and the richness of the 1st-fill casks clothes the new make in sophisticated raiment.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"

2.0,"This Scotch is good on the front end. I definitely taste the raisin and fruits. However, despite trying it neat, with a little water, on a little ice, and also after letting it sit for a while neat, I cannot get over the finish. I know the term rancio comes from the Cognac world, but I just keep recalling the Spanish word for rancid and putrid, which is the best way to describe the finish."

2.5,"Sort of artificial bourbon sugary smell. Sherry notes and quarter cask notes are in and out  in the background, so dry fruit are there but it's not thrre. Because it's 1st fill bourbon so you get all that wood spicy notes straight to your nose as well as on your palate all the way from start to finish. It's like the name of the distiller Wolf""burn"".
The bitterness also come through because most likely from 1st fill those american oak. 
If this is using maybe 2nd or 3rd hand of ex bourbon cask might be better for my taste."
0.5,"Effing nasty. So bad, I had to dump it and who dumps whisky? 

Yeah, just keep on lookin’... move along, nothing to see here."

3.0,"Flaviar sample: chemicals, raisins, wood, melon, vanilla. Spicy in mouth with a long pleasant finish."
2.0,"Visual: diluted apple juice yellow. 

Nose: brine. Alcohol heat. Marmalade. Mostly indistinguishable asaide from nostril burn. 

Taste: not oily at all. Very light. Sherry cask. Very little burn. No peat. 
Sweet, faint vanilla caramel, almost a stevia sweetness. Not a complex dram. 

Finish: very fast. 

Overall: not outstanding. Unremarkable. More like a box wine type of whiskey due to its lack of complexity. Nothing stands out in terms of flavor."
