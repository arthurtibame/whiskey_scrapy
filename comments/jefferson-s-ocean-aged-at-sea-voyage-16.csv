4.0,"Smells of standard sugary bourbon notes.

Tastes of salty bourbon notes. Pleasent warm mouth feel, that leaves a healthy glow."

4.5,"Maybe it is a gimmick but I actually feel like it smelled like I was right next to the ocean. I definitely got the saltiness and was actually very impressed with this. After reading some of the reviews of previous batches, I had moved this one down on my list of things to try. I received a bottle as a gift and couldn’t be happier. To me, it was very reminiscent of Blanton’s. Sweet and oily with a slightly lighter amber color. Definitely get the vanilla and maybe a slight tobacco or leather, can’t quite put my finger on it. Overall, I would say it is delicious and I’m quite surprised it isn’t more popular."

3.5,"First glass of the night, was at a party so no great notes for any of these but it smelled like a perfectly fine bourbon, and tasted like one with MAYBE some saltiness added to the mix. Nothing I’d spend 70 dollars for."
2.5,It was just ok. Definitely tasted the salt.

5.0,"Altogether pleasant, nice sweet nose, solid bourbon body but smooth, you can really get some fine ocean salt if you want, then an accentuated Jefferson’s black tea finish draws you right back for another sip. A great bourbon for me, just a bit expensive, going to have to make it last."

4.5,"Salt, caramel, vanilla, cherry, dark chocolate, slight cinnamon and spice"
4.0,"Recommendation: A little bit of a novelty but Definitely worth a try!

Smell:  Caramel and a little bit floral

Taste: Caramel, a hint of salt.

Price: Not worth the high price point for a bottle. Should be about $30 cheaper"

4.25,"A bit darker than Voyage 11. Nose is spice and leather. Vanilla and spice follow. Hint of salt at finish. Smooth, light mouthfeel throughout. Finishes well."

null,"I definitely get cherry and leather. Unique. Very distinctive and tasty. I think the idea behind putting the barrels out to sea has less to do with subjecting it to the salty air, and more to do with the constant movement of the boats, resulting in more liquid coming into contact with the oaky barrel. Some reviews mention the salt they taste. I don’t taste a saltier bourbon at all. But definitely more leather."

3.5,"I have a bit of a love..... hate relationship with this Bourbon. The Voyages do vary pretty considerably and are either outstanding or just plain mediocre (read over priced). I loved voyage 10 and 11 and felt 7, 12 and 14 were very mediocre. Those of course factors the high price point ($80-$100). Let's dive into voyage 16:
Upon entry we have a buttery mouthfeel with rich toffee, vanilla and brown sugar. Mid pallette features a baking spice swell, as it tames it leads to a vanilla, oak and salt water taffee finish. That note does linger and is pleasant.
So now where does Voyage 16 stack up?? Honestly it's a split decision. I'd be happy to own a bottle since it reminds me of a less flavorful voyage 11. It's very drinkable but also unremarkable. Overpriced for sure, but shooooot if you got it go for it! 😂 
It's a guilty pleasure for sure and one I would pull on regularly if I had a bottle. That said, it's not worth a C-Note to me. 
Cheers all!"

4.0,"very smooth,  not oily with nice vanilla notes"
4.5,"Nose... Like warm candied apples with a hint of sea salt.. Refined and rich with definite dessert qualities...

Appearance... a nice dark amber mixed with light copper...

Taste... The sea salt is as real as I could have hoped for. I can sense the brine that they set out for. It's bright, peppery, and filled with sweet notes throughout...

Overall.... Astounding, truly it's remarkable how the sea comes through. While this leave almost dessert set to me, the ocean is in each nip. Very enjoyable...."

null,Very subtle and salty.  Delicious

4.0,"Nose: vanilla and spices 
Pallet: fruit, spices, hint of vanilla. Above average body to it, and maybe it’s just my mind playing tricks on me because of the aged at ocean but the slightest hint of sea salt came through at the end."
4.0,"If the salt is just a marketing gimmick, it is genius.  I continue to get it on the nose and taste.  Outside of the salt, I get sweet corn on the nose.  Delicate flavors.  On the taste, the vanilla gives way to spice.  The spice has decent legs.  Those salt sensations are this bourbons unique aspects."
3.0,"Wasn't as sweet as I like. Hoping to get a bit of the sea salt taste, but it came towards the last sips."

3.0,"Had yesterday so going from memory:

N: strong, can almost smell it from a few feet away. Typically bourbon vanilla and caramel with some alcoholic burn mingling 
P: unexpectedly light and floral. Rosey taste with some more scotch like notes. Probably some placebo effect going on but in some ways reminds me of an ocean breeze. 
F: the light, breezy, floral notes evolve into more classic bourbon notes of vanilla and caramel, more in line with what the nose would suggest. 

Overall: I’m sure there were more complexities, but hard to recall the day after. Overall this is a good bourbon, but the rating comes in lower because it’s not what I personally would look for in a bourbon. Could probably garnish a 3-3.5 based on novelty and decent flavors/complexity. I wouldn’t seek out a bottle myself, but would buy a glass for the right price 

0-1.5: Disgusting. Worth only mixing or          meeting the drain. 
2: Bad. Drinkable, but majorly flawed 
2.5: Sub-par. OK, but bland or somewhat flawed. 
3: Good. Decent stuff, but I won’t be rushing to buy it 
3.5: Very good. I’d love to keep a bottle around
4: Excellent. I would like to own a case. A go to for me that is worthy of celebrating 
4.5: Incredible.Truly high end, elite level, very noteworthy
5: Sublime. Nearly perfect and an all time favorite"
