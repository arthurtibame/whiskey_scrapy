3.5,"The appearance is like a rosé wine; it has a pinkish hue, hence the name, “Red Horse.” It also has exceedingly thin viscous legs.

The complex nose contains notes of rye spice, corn dust, Potpourri, dry white wine, a young moonshine funk, a pile of dead leaves, and Froot Loops cereal.

The palate has a watery mouthfeel, is sweet and clean, but has a new make/ moonshiney taste with notes of leather, roasted corn, and bitter rhubarb.

The finish is nice with no burn though it’s shorter, and has a dark chocolate taste sending you off. Cheers!"
