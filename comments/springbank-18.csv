4.0,"Moreno is spot on with ""sea salt tinged bitter dark chocolate"". 
Got it in Donostia.

try n:o 2 Gillestugan på Järntorget 2017. rather nice but expensive spicy thing. Salt, heather and the sweetness."

4.0,This excellent whiskey had a very light peat taste but quite a sharp nose. The taste lingered long and made my tongue tingle for a long time.
3.0,not as good as I expected for a 18 year.  reminds me of a glennfiddich 18.  is not as smooth initially nor after.

4.0,"33 open bottles in my collection ranked through multiple blind tastings.  Counting them down!

#12: Springbank.  Single Malt Scotch.  46% ABV.  18 years.
Paid $180
I love Springbank, but won’t be buying this again in the near future.  The 10 and 15 are probably better, even without taking price into consideration.

When tasting blind and rating whiskies in comparison with other whiskies, there are bound to be surprises.  Springbank 18 is an example of a whisky that did shockingly more poorly than expected.  This is bold and complex, still unmistakeably Springbank in my blind tastings.  However, it was harsh and unbalanced (too grassy) compared to the better whiskies on this countdown.  It’s still obviously a decent dram, but not worth the cost.  This is the second most expensive bottle on my countdown.  Springbank 18 is best enjoyed alone and slowly to get all its nuances.  It probably has all the flavors on the flavor wheel, but leans too heavy on the earthy/grassy side when tasted blind with other whiskies.  This begs the question, what is the best way to judge a whisky?  A Blind line-up or a single serve and with full knowledge of the contents?

4.0,"Slightly smoky, great, rich aftertaste. Solid."
5.0,"Light peat, berries and honey on the nose. Green apples, bananas, and semi-sweet chocolate on the palate. The finish is smooth, spicy and of medium length. So many different elements shine through, yet all in perfect harmony. I simply love this expression."

5.0,"Monumentally delicious, this is a whisky you sip, not chug. The nose is herbaceous and briny, with subtle notes of honey and berries. The palate is fruity and well-balanced, with a full and oily mouthfeel. Sherry is foundational to its overall flavor, with peat and smoke both present and complimentary. The finish is prolonged and spicy, with cinnamon and vanilla enveloping your tongue for minutes on end. An accomplishment!"

4.5,"very mild nose at first, apple, a little peat. Taste hits you hard, so intense. Apple, salt, peat, so wildly complex. This is definitely a sipper. So many different flavors pop out as time goes by. wow."
4.0,"Springbank 18 year - 2014 edition.  I'm a bit shocked to see that this is a 2014 but 14/301 is what's here and the 14 should be the year.  Bought a 2014 longrow 18 not all that long ago as well as a 12 (old packaging) so I guess not that surprising.  The box and bottle however look awfully nice to be this vintage.  Oh well 301 so end of the year 2014 at least.  

Nose - classic springbank BBQ peat as I have come to think of it.  There's a bit of a wine character not just a sherry note (this is heavily sherried I'm fairly certain).  I get a bit of oak but given 18 years not a lot.  As it's opening up I'm starting to get vanilla from the bourbon.  A very clean springbank nose, much more refined than the 12's and 15's.  I'm not sure this is a good thing but it just is what it is.  

Taste - Opens with a lot of vanilla, transitions to some sherry, then moves into that springbank funk with BBQ and more sherry, spices form, it heats up, and then nicely and gently finishes.  There's gentle smoke over the whole experience, perhaps the most smoke I've gotten on a springbank to date.  Oh yeah vanilla cream over this nice bitter sherry bite, savory smoke, a touch of meat, a really nice medium finish.

Only real negative I have for this one is that it really does drink a bit like water at first before the sherry and peat and sparks of springbank build up and send you on an epic journey.  Normally 46% is that almost there but not there spot for a whisky and this might showcase that like no other.  48% would be a game changer.  

170 buck, well worth it, and yes I want another bottle or two."

5.0,"WhiskeyLive Dublin 2018. Best of the night.

If I ever capture that (stereotypical) little mischievous bearded Irish sprite I know how I’m going to use those 3 wishes.

Wish 1: A camel. I’d travel to work on it. Weaving through the static cars like those cocky motorcyclists. All the other commuters looking up enviously - losers!

Wish 2: Specific transmutation powers. Whether at a crowded party or on a quiet evening alone I will be able to change water into Springbank 18. You know, like that other guy. Uri Gellar I think.

Wish 3: Erase “Love Actually” for all eternity. I hate that film. It’s like a Christmas card full of sick."

3.5,"An older bottle (Jan 2nd, 2010.)  Nose is light, but has some cookie dough, tropical fruit and very light peat notes.  Flavor starts sweet.  Golden fruits, doughy-like malt.  Finishes with light peat.  Overall, it's just not very rich."

Nose: Toffee, Red Apple, Mint Chocolate, Strawberries, Flowers, Citrus, Apricots, Smoke, Blackberries, Orange, Walnuts, Vanilla, Almonds, Pineapple, Mango

Palate: Dried Fruit, Chocolate, Maple, Brown Sugar, Pepper, Dates, Prunes, Raisins, Almonds, Hazlenuts, Grilled Meats

Finish: Lemon Cake, Chocolate, Toffee, Dates, Raisins, Pepper, Citrus, Beef, Cherries"
3.75,"Nose: the same spice and dry summer hay you know from the classic 10y, some minerals (beach sand), walnuts, tomato and some fresh cuts stone fruit with vanilla. To be honest - not much different than the 10y really. 

Palate: oh ok well the palate and finish are much more intense than the 10y. Wow, really an improvement in the Springbank palette. Super sweet and malty, ginger, lots of mixed dry spices (garam masala, cumin, megnut, juniper, all spice and stuff like that). What a rollercoaster of tastes.

I really like it. It’s a nicely put together whisky and interesting in contrast with the younger expression. But to be very honest the 10y isn’t worse really and I must say I like them equally. The 18 is more mellow and not as aggressive. It is different - yes - but both are equally good for what they are. I’m not sure if it is necessary to try the popular 15y as well but I will see what other Springbanks there are - the character is really unique and likeable."
4.5,"Nose- Raspberries, bananas with brown sugar, honey, wave of peat, followed by the signature cambletown funk

Palate- honey initially, blending into bright fruits, chili oil, earthy peat, olive oil, vanilla

Finish- long, spicy finish with notes of chili spice, vanilla, and ripe fruits


Really good whiskey overall. The nose is full of bright fruits, along with complimentary notes of bananas and honey. The palate starts with a wave of honey and fruits, which then moves to a short bout of peat, and is overtaken by a wave of chili spice. The finish is dominated by the spice and my only complaint is that the finish becomes a little simplistic."
