5.0,"This was the highlight of my best tasting experience so far.  11/7/16, my wife's birthday, we went to Charleston in Baltimore, MD - best fine dining restaurant in Baltimore, and probably in the entire state of Maryland.  After enjoying a great dinner, we decided to splurge on some expensive pours: highland park 25, followed by Duncan Taylor Lonach (43.1% ABV, distilled at Glenlivet in 1968, bottled in 2005), followed by Tesseron lot 53 (cognac).  All of these were $50+ for 1.5 oz.  The wife liked the HP 25, but I was most impressed by the Lonach.  Because there was just a little left in the bottle afterwards, and it was a birthday, we got to keep the bottle.  So, I do have a bottle of 37 year old whisky in my collection, but alas, it is empty.  I don't have notes (can't be taking notes on my wife's birthday), but I have memories of garden flowers on the nose.  Of course, it was so smooth - I remember giggling at the mouthfeel, because it didn't even feel like a liquid; it was like eating vapors.  Despite the age, there was almost no oak.  There were big floral notes, fresh apples, pears, peaches, apricot, and a soft cinnamon spiciness in the background.  The finish was long and full of vanilla.  Sadly, I probably will never get to try this again.  Best whisky I've ever tried?  Hmm... I'm not going to rate the dram, because the atmosphere, occasion, and inebriation probably was tipping the scales somewhat."
