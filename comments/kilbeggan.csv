2.0,Has some typical Irish whiskey qualities. However it is noticably young with a burnt plastic flavor. I'm really looking forward to the kilbeggan distillery to start up. Hopefully we'll see some changes ahead.
2.0,"Rich and oily, lots of retaining heat and not easily drank."
3.0,"After a smoother whiskey, Id be likely to give it a 2. It's a wee bit harsh, more oily than credited and thicker and smokier than rated. I buy for the smokey and savor the sweet. But the after taste is brief and fading. I think it's the briney and salty I could do without."

4.0,great every day sipper  I enjoy this neat and cold.  I keep a bottle in the freezer and let it open slowly as I'm sipping on it  The nose is grain and citrus. First notes on the palette honey and vanilla oak. Crisp citrus finish.

2.0,"Nose is sweet cereal, slight dried raisins, some grassy notes. Custard like taste with more wheat cereal. Finishes short with fresh wood and pastries. Much worse with water, nose has more ethanol and taste becomes more bitter. Too light in flavor and complexety to even compare to the popular Bushmills or Jameson. Cheaper in this case is not worth the try, pay the few extra bucks for the aforementioned or Powers Gold."

2.5,"For some whiskies, it can be hard to write down a lot of tasting notes because there simply is not much happening. Imagine the exact opposite of a peated Islay malt - that's Kilbeggan. Light, sweet and indistinctly floral, the aroma disintegrates into hints of cereals, vanilla and peach. Tasting thin, bland but less spirity than expected, there are notes of caramel candies, bitter honey and distant oak. There is no real finish, it just fades away. A harmless, mass-produced Irish blend which is light on every aspect, so do not feel guilty to put this into Irish coffee.

3.0,"Dec 17
Had after a starter of Midleton Barry Crockett Legacy, which probably helped. A 3 to 3.5 stars.

Second tasting while watching the (delayed) Manchester derby. Tasted after Teeling Single Grain and Jura Origin.  Nose is light cereal, not at all overpowering even on a full intake of air. Taste is simple, lightly sweet and very pleasant. Still earns its 3.5 stars, I reckon."

Note- This is a very easy drink although a little flat."

3.75,"Not as punchy as Jameson. This whiskey I saw recommended online as a better Irish brand. Not thinking much of the region, this bottle breathed new life for me. Slightly more smokey adds nicely to the typical Irish sweetness. Very approachable but not very complex, but moreso than Jamo, Paddy or Powers."

2.5,"Nose: Cereal, muted honey, green grassy hay notes, white grape juice. Fresh and fragrant.

Palate: Sweet and easy arrival. Cereal palate with a little soft spice and fruit.  Nutty, some lemon hints, caramel, apple cider and malt.

Finish: Short as a winter's day. Mild cereal notes fade into a dimly-lit sunset.

On the whole - average. There's nothing whatsoever bad about this whisky but neither is there anything to praise. It's just good and average (and heck, there's worse than that).

Super easy to drink, nothing unpleasant - but as a mixer just a bit nowhere. This is probably as close as you can get to the definition of ""average"" whiskey. At the price I'd recommend it to anyone who scares easily and wants a soft introduction to this wonderful world of whisky. When you're ready, there are some real treats in store :-)
