0.25,"Received this as a gift for Christmas and was told it was on sale for $40; it would have been cheaper to just buy me some coal. I'm trying to drink this again for the sixth time and have conceded there's no getting used to this awful stuff. Don't get me wrong, I'm by no means some connoisseur or snob when it comes to spirits. I can appreciate a good single barrel and on the same token don't mind slipping a 1/2 pint of a cheap bourbon in my hip pocket. But this stuff is nothing but some millennial's ideal of an uppity white whiskey that they wasted a perfectly good barrel on.  All I can say is get off the fence; either drink some shine or get something that been aging for more than a few months."
