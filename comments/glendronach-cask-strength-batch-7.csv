4.75,This scotch is almost perfect. Maybe a touch thin? So good. Maybe my new favourite.

4.0,"A lot of fruits mixed looks like a complex whisky. Hidden notes of cherry and red fruits but citrus are predominants. Not smoky at all. Palate: surprising, the Sherry Cask adds it's very very high flavors. Strong but not spicy. Blackberries. Adding water lets taste nuts' notes. Finish of grapes. Vanilla notes also pops to the nose with water. Finish peppery even if note the most present flavor on the mouth with tanin"
3.75,"Smagt batch 2.
Dejlig næse, meget sødme, for sød i eftersmagen"
4.5,"info: La 7e batch de la série Cask Strenght de GlenDronach toujours avec son jeu de PX et de Oloroso. Cette batch ne s'est pas rendu ici au Québec en SAQ mais, elle était disponible (j'ai acheté la dernière bouteille) en Ontario en LCBO. En effet, lorsque j'ai communiqué avec le personnelle de la SAQ, on m'a affirmé qu'il n'y avait aucune commande de prévu de ce produit. Étant un fan (de plus ne plus) de la distillerie, je n'ai donc pas hésité a courir à la LCBO à Hawkesburry pour acheter la dernière bouteille. Je n'ai pas eu la chance de gouter aux batch précédente malheureusement et je ne pourrai donc faire la comparaison.

Nez: Gingembre, cannelle, fraise et vanille.

Bouche: Épices et fruits rouges, sucre brun et noisettes

Finale: une longue et onctueuse finale sur le Sherry et les épices.

Overall: Je ne m'attendais à rien de moins d'un GlenDronach. Saveur intense et riche, belle texture, douceur malgré le au taux de %. Cette belle chaleur sur les épices wow! Si vous aimez les GlenDronach ou le Sherry en général, vous allez vous y retrouver. Le champs aromatique n'a rien de dépaysant mais son intensité aromatique compense cette lacune (si s'en est une). Bref, je ne suis pas le plus impartiale quand il s'agit de GlenDronach mais, celui-là est vraiment très agréable à boire. C'est le genre de bouteille qui va descendre souvent de l'étagère! 91%"
4.25,"This is the seventh edition of the bottling, reading the reviews of the previous ones  it would seem that the quality has slightly decreased from batch to batch. Not being able to make comparisons, I take note of it, hoping to have the opportunity to try the others too.
An elegant dark amber (or, if you prefer, deep gold) illuminates the glass as soon as the whisky is poured: the appearance is oily and inviting.
The nose, needless to say, immediately expresses the profound influence of the ex-Sherry casks (Pedro Ximénez is the master), together with vanilla, caramel, raisins. Warm, enveloping, buttery aromas, with a hint of citrus. The alcohol is there but you don't feel it.
On the palate, alcohol pinches a little but the sweetness of ripe fruit immediately comes to compensate for it, with citrus still next to figs, peaches, a very summery aroma: it gives the idea of ​​the scents that are felt in the air being close to fruit trees in July. A pinch of spices (nutmeg), cream cake, butter biscuits. Softer than on the nose, enveloping, sumptuous, sweet without being cloying, thanks also to the balance given by the gradation that avoids the overflow of the sherried.
In the finish, there are raisins, vanilla, together with a light woody note and a general feeling of warmth."
4.25,loving this one.   very well balanced

4.0,Actually Batch 8. Toffee flavor sweet and smooth
4.75,"This was a gift actually of roughly 95% of a bottle from someone who hated it.  He hates Macallan, knows I like Macallan (like not love), and says this is similar.  I went in to this somewhat skeptical seeing as it got a solid thumbs down.

Nose: Raisin abounds with oak, sherry funk, honey, milk chocolate, and toffee.  Quite a nose on this and very complex.  Almost no ethanol punch which is interesting at over 115 proof.

Flavor:  Boom!  Trail mix!  It's like grabbing a handful of trail mix and putting everything in your mouth: First raisins, then boiled peanut, then milk chocolate, and toffee.  Wow!

Finish:  A little spicy with moderately drying oak.  Quite a long finish that is somehow raisiny and sweet and tapers in to barrel char and honey.

This is truly outstanding.  Definitely taking the top spot for me on sherry finished malt whiskey.  Super complex and delicious.  I highly recommend."

1.0,"Sees odd that I know I've had this a handful of times, even done a few side by sides and the bottle is still above the label even after this pour.  Clearly one I've been taking safe pours with.  

Nose - Dark berry notes, some musty oak, young spirit, alcohol.  A bit of chocolate at the end.  

Taste - fruity, oakey, young.  Water brings out really just a lighter version of the same.  

I really can't think of anything nice to say about this one.  It is ok outside of some younger notes.  The sherry flavor is pretty good but it's young.  

I hate to say it but for over 100 bucks, this isn't just a pass but a hard one. Bonus points for what seem like quality sherry casks and cask strength, but I still am stuck feeling this is a 1 star whisky."
