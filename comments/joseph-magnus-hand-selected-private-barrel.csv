4.5,"Neat.  OHLQ Barrel 1378. MGP.  Graham Cracker and oak upfront.  All spice and vanilla.  Cinnamon.  More spice notes and less dessert notes for a MGP.  Hint of apple.

Thinner texture than I was expecting.  Spicy on the tongue with that cinnamon and spice still dominate.  Caramel and vanilla with lots of cinnamon again.  Tingle on the tongue.  Get that Apple again the more I sip.  Caramel and cinnamon with the apple on the legs.  Pretty fitting for a fall day watching the leaves change and fall.

It’s good.  It’s unique for MGP too.  I don’t think I have described something and a caramel apple with a layer of cinnamon.  That’s a cool combination."
