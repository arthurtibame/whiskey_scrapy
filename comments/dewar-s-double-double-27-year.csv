4.25,"So this is pricey for sure. $110 for a 375 ml bottle. At this price it should be liquid gold. First sense on the nose is really nice caramel and dried fruit. The taste does not quite live up to the nose or the price.  It is definitely an incredibly smooth Scotch. The characteristic smoke is softly rounded out and the burn is slow and low. I will say this is probably the nicest bottle of Scotch I will ever buy, but not sure I would splurge on it again."
