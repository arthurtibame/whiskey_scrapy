2.25,"Strong on the moonshine, light on the smoothness.  Probably better mixed into something than for sippin’.  At least it was on sale and you can reuse the bottle."
0.75,High taste of moonshine followed by an off acetone. Slightly sickly sweet. For the price point there are much much better bourbons. I picked this up thinking it would be at least decent. It is not. I should have read the fine print on the back that says it has only been aged 24 hours.
5.0,Great smoky aroma. Smooth and rich flavor.
2.0,"Jfc it’s so sweet...

I think it reminds me of the Highwest Campfire, without the price tag. 

It’s not terribly terrible."
5.0,Strong on the moonshine side of the spectrum (corn flavor) but despite it's high proof it is still smooth.

0.25,"The fragrance when you open the bottle is of yeast and fermenting mash.  This is your first warning.  Poured into a glass, it has the appearance of a cloudy watered down lemonade.  This is strike 2.  It’s taste has a base flavor of moonshine and yeast.  Strike 3."
