3.25,"Nose - (w/o water) Red berries, fruity apples/pears, light orange, sweet honey, corn flake metallic (w/ water) pretty much the same but the metallic is gone

Taste - (w/o water) Very hot initially, syrupy but thin fruity sweet, dried persimmon like sweetness, red berries, metallic honey, lightly drying (w/ water) Less heat, more spicy red berries, metallic is gone, thing honey, faint dried apple

Finish - (w/o water) Slow fading heat, light red berries, not much there (w/ water) Lingering heat again, sweet red berries/apple juice.

Score - 79/100

Final Thoughts - This dram has a fairly standard nose, a tiny bit hot but not unbearable. Once it hits the palate the higher proof is a bit overwhelming but once you get over that it's fairly pleasant. Nice ""generic"" fruity taste and no off putting flavors, but a tiny bit boring & the heat is a bit distracting. The finish is quite boring though as the heat/tingle dominates.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

3.5,Not a bad drop. Standard Edradour fare. Plenty of character but as usual slightly out of kilter. This time sulfur. Now I do like it but it's like they shaved off the heads off several boxes of matches and dumped them in. Massive overkill. Watering the shite out of it calmed it down a bit and I was amazed how much water it could handle without being ruined (I put nearly a bucket in over several attempts at watering the thing and it just never ever got overdiluted). I enjoyed it at the end...and you did get the wine cask coming through. 3.5.
