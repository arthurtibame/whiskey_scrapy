4.0,"Nose:
Caramel popcorn but also movie theatre butter which don't seem like they should go together well, but here it seems natural.  Bread pudding with vanilla ice cream and pralined nuts.

Palate:
More popcorn - I should be watching a movie right now! Full flavor, very smooth.  Transitions into a Maple syrup finish

Finish:
Long and sweet, Maple syrup, minimal tannin or oak

Very nice Canadian whisky.  Would be a perfect movie-watching whisky, or a nice dessert finish to the night."
3.5,"Really wanted to try this whiskey based on rum howlers review and saw a small 375 ml bottle for $29 at a B.C. private store. I didn’t like it as much as he did, but by no means does it deserve the 1 star review you see here it is an easy 3 to 3.75.  Based on nose it is wonderful vanilla, buttery sweet and mild corn. Taste is vanilla creamy smooth with an little medicinal after taste which is why it loses its points for me I would compare this to a smooth subtle Irish whiskey like experience it isn’t punch in the face flavour. It’s smooth and subtle with a lot going on in the softness there definitely worth trying especially if you can get the beautiful 375ml bottle! No really risk at $29 and you can say you had a 21 year old whiskey :)"

1.0,"Spirits journalists seem to have a thing for Highwood. Maybe it's the history, as there's an interesting story behind much of their whisky: hyper-aged corn whiskey that was included in their purchase of the (I believe) Potters distillery. But that's all it is: a good story. It's 100% corn whisky, and there's not much you can do, cooperage-wise, to make 100% corn whisky taste particularly compelling. Soft, smooth, honey, maple, timber. Sweet. Citrus zest, woodchips, toasted oak. Fragrant flowers, creamy. It's . . . Canadian whisky. It's mild. It's bland. It's not complex or interesting. About the nicest thing I can say about Century Reserve (and Highwood's other super-aged expressions, which are pulled from the same stocks) is that it's the most affordable 20+ year old whisky you'll ever get the chance to try."
