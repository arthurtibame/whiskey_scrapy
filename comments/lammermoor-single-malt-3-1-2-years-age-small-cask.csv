4.0,"I haven't been a huge fan of NZ whiskey distilleries so far. Workshops blah, Thompsons so so, Cardrona average and hideously overpriced. FINALLY I found two with promise Lammermoor and Divergence.

Now when I chatted to the couple who were the owners and they said they were farmers I was like... good sign as Dingle's head distiller was a farmer.


Right given it's a little known distillery heres the background 


Lammermoor Station illegally distilled ‘moonshine’ for all those who travelled the Dunstan Trail an early gold miners trail. In the early 1900s the Elliot family began to farm the 15,000 acre station, which is nestled in the Central Otago region of New Zealand. Although the distillery was no longer functioning the current distillers grandfather reminded him of the Station's original still which he found shortly after his return from the war. Unfortunately they couldn't find it so they started afresh.

I didn't keep notes as my that stage my handwriting was illegible but I was impressed. They aren't selling this stuff for some reason but giving it away with official hipflasks (which are quite expensive so really they are selling it but not to sure why they don't sell separately). Anyhow they have good taste buds and i'm looking fwd to the future."
