4.5,"Nose: sweet notes of fruit, specifically cherry and Orange with a subtle note of lemon. Caramel and maple. Subtle sweetness, possibly from a sherry cask?

Flavour: bitter toffee, a nice peppery flavour with notes of coffee and chocolate and a subdued maraschino cherry, beautiful malty-ness underlies it all."

5.0,"A very balanced and flavorful dram! The nose is very non-descript, but on the palate it is extremely smooth and silky. I get tropical fruits, honey. Quite reminiscent of  graham crackers melting in your mouth. The silkyness prompted me to experiment chilling the 2nd dram a little. The result: liquid nectar!"
