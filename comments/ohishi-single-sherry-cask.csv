4.0,So much Sherry in this! Absolutely delicious.
5.0,"This is simply beautiful- or elegant as the review states.  The sherry cask really gives it a beautiful bite - and it’s so herbal and full flavored - wow - really surprising, balanced and smoothe - I love it!  Tasted with Judith at O’Neill’s 1/24/18, Judith says “it’s grown on me”"

4.0,"I recently did a 3-way, Japanese whiskey tasting flight using samples generously supplied by my NJ connection: @PBMichiganWolverine.  This single barrel whisky finished in second place behind the vaunted Hibiki 21, but ahead of Nikka Whisky From The Barrel.  Please see that review for more details.

This particular whisky is made from rice instead of grain or malt and was rather young when it was put into first-fill, ex-sherry casks for further aging.  I believe this bottle runs about $45, which is a fantastic deal IMO.  It’s copper/slightly amber in color, oily and makes some slow running, fat legs in the taster.  Lots of heavy droplets form around the rim of the glass, as well.

The nose immediately struck me as saki- which makes perfect sense, but after a little time I got an explosion of aromas like sweet raspberries, maple, nuts, green tea with mint and rice flour.  It’s nicely complex for what I assume is a pretty young whisky.

The palate is butterscotch and sherry, with vanilla and cashews, raisins and maple syrup.  It’s effectively a liquid trail mix.  There was a bit of a brash, cherry cough syrup note on the tail end, but it didn’t ruin the palate completely.

The finish was medium length, very nutty with a raisin and prune flavor lingering for quite some time.  It was mostly oily overall but did finish ultimately dry and warming.

Overall, it’s a flavor bomb- there’s a lot going on and it makes me think the flavors are somewhat artificial, but I still wanted more after the glass was dry.  Thanks again to my friend, Pranay for the pour.  I wouldn’t mind locating a bottle of this for those nights I want a sweet, liquid dessert after dinner.  This would fit the bill perfectly.  4 stars.  Cheers."
4.0,"Cherry, licorice, velvet"
4.0,"Continuing on with the bonus samples from the SDT, here we have a Japanese rice whisky. Ohishi Single Sherry Cask. A NAS bottled at 42.3% ABV, is non chill filtered and natural color of dark copper. 

Warm sherry on the nose. I am more reminded of a sherried cognac than a malt whisky (though it is obviously neither). Raisins, very floral, some oak and hay. A vague nuttiness, plenty of toffee, vanilla and butterscotch. Candied apples, rice wine and more sherry. The more I nose it the more it feels like a whisky and less like a cognac. Very nice, warm and comforting. 

Like the nose, the palate is more cognac than malt, though at times that feeling is reversed. Sherry, pancake syrup, berries, nutty. Butterscotch, faintly reminiscent of a Canadian style whisky. Vanilla, floral, cherries. Very much a cool fall afternoon dram, when the leaves are falling and the air is crisp, but not yet cold. 

A medium to light bodied mouthfeel that is creamy and mouth coating. 
The finish is long with sherry, cherries, brown sugar and raisins. 

My first rice whisky was a wonderful experience. A better mouthfeel and a stronger intensity of flavors on the palate would have truly made this spectacular rather than “merely” great. At $70-80 this is a no brainer and if I see a bottle I intend to buy it. One to sit and ponder or to get lost in its warmth. 4.25 and a big thanks to @PBMichiganWolverine for the sample. 
Cheers"

3.0,"I love Japanese whiskey but have trouble getting above a 4 with this. I wish it had more body and complexity.

N: light, sweet, nutty

P: nutty and viscous, Sherry immediately presents itself unlike nose, rich fruity notes as it sits on tongue, almost has a bitter quality to it

F: Dry wine finish, the Sherry has definitely taken over.

If you like a side of grain whiskey with your Sherry you'll love this. NOT the other way around. That's why I gave this a lower score. Needs balance."

3.75,"Not much on the nose, slightly sweet and drinkable. Can taste the rice, which is not a bad thing and adds a slight hint of the same funk as some Sakes. Worth trying, especially if you like rice based alcohols."
3.0,Rice and sherry aroma. Dark fruit and a hint of creme brûlée. Some warming alcohol in the finish. A bit hotter finish than expected.

2.5,"For my last pour of the night, the bar trotted out some of their Japanese offerings. I noted they were afflicted with the scourge of Kurayoshi et al. and was going to brush them off until I saw something I hadn’t seen before: Ohishi Single Sherry Cask. Something completely different for $11 a pour? Why not! 

This is a very different whisky animal if you can even call it whisky, but I like what they’re trying to do. However, this strikes me a very young grain whisky with some reasonable-quality Sherry casks to cover up those obvious flaws. It has nice nutty notes, but an unbalanced, overpowering Sherry influence.  I also can’t overlook the young, grainy, and slightly unpleasant mouthfeel and finish reminiscent of something like a poor-quality, grainy vodka. 

I can’t give out participation points, but this might be worth revisiting in a couple of years if they had an age-stated bottling to try. (Although who would be able to afford it with an age statement?)  For now though, I would avoid this bottle at the $70-$80 price tags I see. 

This bottle gets a 2.5 from me, and personally I would stick with some Nigori."
