4.5,"A real nice drinker on ice. No off flavors, just a nice drinker with a balanced taste. Burn is slow and warm. Citrus nose with a nice flavor."
4.25,"Really enjoyed this. Citrus, vanilla, oak and a quick burn. Best over a big cube. Similar to eagle rare on the rocks. More expensive than ER, but still good."
4.75,"Total Wine and More exclusive, hand selected single barrel #960, 50% abv, aged 5 years. Purchased in Spokane, WA, Feb 2020.

Triticale--a wheat and rye hybrid developed in Scotland--grown on the same 117 year-old family farm in Washington where Dry Fly sources its wheat. Aged in new American oak then finished in a used Townsend Cellars Port barrel; a total of 5 years in barrel. Non chill-filtered straight whiskey.

Cereal and floral fruit nose. Toasted grain and oak, brown sugar, spice, and pepper. Sweet port flavors the finish. Warm and round, full mouthfeel, with the softness of wheat yet the spicy grassy nature of rye. Beautiful deep rosy color. A really nice whiskey, neat or with a cube of ice."
