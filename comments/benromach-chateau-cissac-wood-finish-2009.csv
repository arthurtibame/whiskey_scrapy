3.75,"The year on the label is that of distillation, while bottling is in 2017: we are therefore faced with an 8-year-old whisky (of which just over two passed in the barrels of the French wine).
The color is gold with coppery veins: unlike other whiskys from the distillery, this one has been chill-filtered, perhaps for fear of the excessive impurities caused by the wine barrel?
On the nose the character is sweetly peaty, with red fruits, apple (red) and dried plum together with cereals (young indeed) and a pinch but just a pinch of vanilla. All wrapped in a certain vinous harshness.
The mouth is quite dry, and immediately introduces a soft side of tobacco and peat, smokier than the smell, which still drags the prunes (and let's put in some raisins too), blueberries, apple and vanilla. To accompany everything, a strong salty and marine note and a memory of chocolate. Slight underlying harshness. An amalgam of flavors and aromas not very harmonious but interesting, certainly not boring.
The finish is still dry and astringent (very), smoky (we are from the parts of the burnt wood), vanilla and a pinch of spices, not particularly long."

3.75,"Nose - Tiny wisp of smoke, tangerine peels, lemon, honey, caramel, toasted oak, chocolate orange

Taste - Black pepper, lightly drying fruit stem bitter, chocolate candied orange peel w/ pith, light honey, caramel, faint smoke

Finish - Lingering black pepper tingle, orange/lemon zest, caramel, light fruity pith/stem bitterness

Score - 80/100

Final Thoughts - So I guess the Benromach style is a super lightly peated malt regardless of expression. It's not exactly my thing, but I can see how people would like this. This particular expression isn't too bad as I think somehow the wine cask finish helped tame/mitigate the smoke a bit to a background role. This one had more refreshing citrusy notes which was nice, but there was this tiny hint of bitter pith that got a bit distracting. Nice subtle chocolate/cocoa notes throughout while remaining bright & refreshing. I could see this as a dram to have by the summer/fall campfire.

Would I drink it if offered? - Maybe

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"
4.0,"Slight vanilla, light smoky, full, mild oily."
3.75,Smokey taste with strong tars aroma. After some time opens up and goes very well with a few drops of water.
3.75,"Nez très léger et floral, on se sent dans une tourbière.
Attaque sucrée et bonne présence en bouche, pas hyper aromatique.
Longue finale sur la langue, chargée en chocolat, très légèrement fumé."
