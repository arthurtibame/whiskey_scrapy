3.75,"Shocked I'm not just the first review on batch 1 but on batch 2 and nobody has reviewed the younger batches. 

So....this is going to be a crazy review. Just get ready.

Nose - intense! There is a lot of alcohol on this massive CS bourbon. It's sweet, fruity, rich, dark, and has some hints of chocolate. 

Taste - Rich and intense, drying, just a flavor bomb. You get a this amazing and layered caramel and fruits. Some dark chocolate. Some bitter oak, then some spice, then back to fruity characters. The finish is medium to long with all kinds of just over the top flavors. Yet there are smooth and subtle flavor, it's like you get a stream of sugary sweet notes under all the powerful alcohol and other notes. 

So I feel an obligation to bring this one way down in abv to see what I get. So my glass now smells like watered down buffalo trace almost, I added a LOT of water.  So there's some bitter notes here. It's now giving me a bit of nutty flavor. it's got a lot of good bourbon notes. Clearly don't do this to your bourbon, 30% bourbon is stupid, but I wanted to bring this down to see what was there. It loses the sweetness which is funny, but now it's just filled with all kinds of cool bourbon elements. 

Anyway I'm going 3.75 and I'll be coming back to this as I bought 3 bottles. This has serious bourbon of the year potential if king of kentucky doesn't just blow me away again. A bit more harsh and unrefined than a btac but there's as much flavor and complexity."
