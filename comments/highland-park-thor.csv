4.5,"Intense fruit on the nose. On the palate, this tastes like older, classic Highland Park with lots of sherry influence and very light peat. Maybe not quite as full-bodied as I maybe expected from Thor. 95 points"
5.0,"Overall:  Impressive presentation, interesting but somewhat beguiling nose that belies the strength displayed on the palate and finish, thank my wife for this gift!  

Color:  Light amber  

Nose:  Honey and leather, old paper, vanilla fudge, lemon butter, malt and wet wood, allspice, tart cherries, curry powder, hint of peat and smoke

Body:  Medium to full, mouth coating, clings to the glass and palate

Taste:  Sweet peat and spicy smoke explode, with spicy malt throughout, burning wax candles, drying towards the finish, great impact

Finish:  Long, soft smoke, drying oak notes and spice linger for quite some time with vanilla coming through"
