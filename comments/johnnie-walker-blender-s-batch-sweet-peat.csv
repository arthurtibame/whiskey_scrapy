1.0,"Sweet peat my ass.  Bought a pour while on a business trip to Denver.  $10 for the pour...that $10 would’ve been better spent elsewhere.  

Mild nose.  Really not getting anything except cereal notes.  Almost like Soecial K that my daughter eats every morning.  Except the Special K tastes better.  Taste is bland...not getting any peat.  Not getting much of anything except some cereals."
3.75,Subtle smoke with hints of peat and a sweet finish at the end that quickly dissipates. Very enjoyable.
