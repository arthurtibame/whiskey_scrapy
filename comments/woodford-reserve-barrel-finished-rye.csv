1.5,"Nose:
Butterscotch 
Vanilla
Charred meats
Brown sugar
Marjoram
Dried Marshmallow
Rye spice (allspice, fennel)

Taste:
Very wood heavy
Sweet tea
Melted caramel

Taste is extremely offputting. It is like drinking sugar water that has had freshly-toasted wood chips sitting in it for a week. I'm glad Woodford performs these experiments, but I think this one belongs in the vault."
