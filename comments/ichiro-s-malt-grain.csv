4.0,"A sweet, light rum with good flavors and is very affordable in Japan. Not sure it’s worth the US premium."

4.0,"oak, charred oak. it lingers for a while and then you get green apple peel on the side of your tongue. a little water tames the wood and brings out a citrus note on the nose, light vanilla. with water its bright and spicy with yhat green apple moving to top of mouth. long after taste"

3.25,"Taste of ..... caramel and butter scotch. Slight hints of vanilla. 
Smell of ..... floral and fruits
Finish is ..... short but leaves behind toffee notes 

Adding a little water....doesn't seem to unlock anything extra for me. But it does seem a bit more approachable and easy to drink because of the reduced alcohol"

3.75,"A bit sweet, slightly fruity, smooth and beautiful!"
3.75,"Light straw color.
Buttered pear on the nose.
First sip is sweet, hot and a little spicy.
Wood notes, albeit faint, present themselves only after several sips.
The mouthfeel is lightly creamy.
This whisky is an interesting pour with plenty of flavor. It comes across as “young and feisty”, which isn’t necessarily bad...just not at this price point."

4.0,"A little bit of a softer, sweeter finish with a little water"
5.0,"So much fun drinking this. The butterscotch, vanilla, and banana on the nose and the toffee, gingerbread and black pepper stands out the most to me. The finish is nice with vanilla and banana again. $30 in Japan per bottle so it’s a steal for me when I bring it home. Just a fun drink, perfect for summer."

5.0,"Very comparable to the Hibiki 17. Notes of fruit, caramel, and malty cereal. A blend of Whiskies from Japan, Scotland, Ireland, US, and Canada, a true world whisky, where east meets west"
5.0,"Smooth, creamy, a bit sweet. Quite good."
5.0,"My first Japanese whisky. Side not, you spell it with a Y if it’s not from Scotland 😉. So as usual I go off the fist taste, and holy shit this is what the rich folks would say “ exquisite” lol. You can spell the smoothness right off the bat, kinda like a sweet smell but not like a bourbon. It has that scotch taste with a bit smoke to it. Loved it"

4.0,"700 ml bottle purchased in Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan back in December 2018. Poured into a snifter at home, neat. Pale golden yellow color. Aromas of caramel, some corn and wheat, malt, some alcohol, a little smoky/toasty hint. Tastes of light caramel, some citrus peel, malt, subtle peat, corn and wheat, touch of spice, light alcohol. Nice blend."
4.0,"Nose: A sharp stab to the olfactory if brought to close to the nostrils but from a distance, you get a very smooth and soft vanilla carmel followed by rolling fruits like apricot, dried mandarin peels and gentle cinnamon. 

Pallette:  Has a lasting but distinct vanilla,  mature D'Anjou pear, banana, and apricot fruit blend. 

General: A lathering smoothness followed by a slowely dissapaiting warmth in the gullet. Has a golden honey color that matches the medium body and balanced flavors and aromas.

As a newbie to Japenese whiskeys, it's a damn good one for me."

3.0,Meek and shallow. Uninteresting would be putting it frankly.
4.25,"One of those bottles you never expect to try. This Japanese blend (it says malt & grain whisky) is amazing on the nose and very complex in the palate, but not quite tasty (at least for me). Very interesting though. 

Bottled at 46%, burnished gold color.

On the nose it is absolutely fantastic. It is by far its best feature. So so sweet. Red fruits jam, Vanilla, Banana and two ""deaf"" or dim notes: herbal and salt in the back.

On the palate it has a lot of layers and every sip is different but in this case is not a good feature, since it becomes more a grain than a malt whisky.

Cereal, Brownies, White wine grapy note in the first sip. Grain whisky coming up after a few sips, Chocolate and corn sensation typical from grain.
Herbal grassy note from grain becomes stronger. 

Finish is short/mediun with clove notes.

Overall i give this dram an 85 over 100 and maybe a +1 for complexity. Cheers!"
