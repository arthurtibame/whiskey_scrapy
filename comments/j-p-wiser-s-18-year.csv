3.0,"If you're a fan of Canadian whisky as a style--all vanillas and butterscotches, all soft and sweet and mild, with just a hint of rye spice--you'll be a fan of Wiser's 18. That basically describes this juice to a ""t"". But at 18 years and $65 Cdn., I feel like this whisky ought to be so, so much more interesting than it is. Flavours are vanilla, French vanilla, lemongrass, pencil shavings, ozone, cinnamon and apple. Faint brining spices. A touch of cinnamon, some butterscotch. A touch of maple, and fresh lumber in the finish. Not bad, just very typically Canadian and not even remotely worth the price. Pales in comparison to the cheaper Wiser's Legacy--a legitimately rye heavy, rye forward whisky that could give any American straight rye whiskey a run for its money."

3.0,I don't know why you'd buy this rather tame choice over the much more vibrant Wiser's Legacy. Age doesn't make everything better.

2.0,The initial nose is much more like a blended Scotch than what I'd expect from a Canadian whiskey. Surprisingly rough for a 18 year old product.

3.0,"This is lean, light, but shows some maturity too. Nice vanilla, caramel, and soft grain notes. The cream soda sweetness reminds me of younger refreshing bourbons. There’s subtle nuttiness and syrup flavors. I don’t regret what I paid at the bar but I wouldn’t throw down for a bottle."

3.0,"Smooth and light with soft oak, light caramel and a hint of vanilla. Certainly better than the 15 year. It’s good but for the price Gibson’s Venerable has more depth. $80 in Ontario."

4.0,"3.7/5 - I'm glad I didn't give up on this bottle.   My first impression was thorough disappointment.  I could not believe I was tasting a whisky matured in wood barrels for 18 years because it was just as light and bland to me as any standard canadian blend.  I was expecting deep rich flavors and something that was distinctly different from the other young whiskys on the shelf.

However I have to say I now feel differently...Maybe it's just my mood but there's a particular oaky sweetness that I'm really enjoying tonight.   The vanilla, nutmeg and creamy custardy orange citrus are really working their magic.   Theres also maple, taffy and a hint of coffee on the nose.  There is an alcoholic nip on the nose but it does go away after letting it sit for around 20 min...Then the real sweetness presents itself.

I decided to compare to Wisers deluxe side by side and the difference was quite clear.  So much more refined without any of the young grainy off notes...Notes I typically don't even notice when drinking wisers deluxe on it's own.  

It is extremely light for an 18 year old whisky, with no finish, but that kinda works here...If you come in expecting an 18 year old scotch or a well aged bourbon you'll probably be very disappointed. 

This is just a smooth, mild but well refined and delicious corn whisky aged in presumably spent barrels."

4.25,"From looking through various reviews, it appears that this pour can be polarizing. Some claim it's lacking in taste, strong ethanol on the nose, too expensive, etc. Others point to its numerous awards and remark on its craftsmanship. I have some thoughts. You're reading those thoughts. Here we go.

To look at this as an 18 year old whisky and treat it and evaluate it the same way you would an 18 year old Scotch would be doing this whisky a disservice. Yes, they share an age statement, but are made by very different processes. Learning more about how this whisky was made really enhanced the tasting experience for me.

It's mostly corn, and not only that, it's distilled to a ridiculously high proof (something around 95%), and put in the barrel to age. At that high a proof, it's mostly a neutral spirit, so in approaching this pour, it's really a study in oak. It is blended with a small amount of 18 year old rye, but this is mostly all flavor from the barrel. Wisers is really taking advantage of those loopy Canadian liquor laws.

After resting for about 20 minutes, none of the ethanol folks complain about in other reviews are present on the nose. In its place is a big hello sailor of classic Canadian notes-vanilla, maple, rye, some dried fruit, as well as that characteristic lumber note I tend to find in Canadian whiskies. It's quite elegant and complex. The taste, even at 40%, has gentle, sweet barrel spice, more vanilla and maple, butterscotch, toffee, pepper, and a little tobacco. Right on the back palate is a pithy, citrus note reminiscent of grapefruit or the orange peel from an Old Fashioned. The finish is surprisingly long, with a cooling effect, along with a lingering note of pencil shavings from elementary school while integrating all of the palate flavors.

WOW! A great pour indeed. Definitely don't regret picking up the bottle. Look, I know that here in the States we can't get most of the really good Canadian stuff (though I just heard that Lot 40 CS is coming to MA & IL). This is one of the good ones. ""But it's overpriced"". I've paid $130-$160 for 18 year old Scotch, so no, it's not overpriced. An 18 year old whisky for $60-$70? Sign me up. ""But it's 40%"". Who cares?! I've been guilty of being a snob about that in past reviews, but I'm changing my tune for some bottles. There's a time and a place for 40% ABV. Not every night is cask strength night. 

I would pick this one up. You have to let it breathe. That's the key. If you do, you're rewarded with one of the best expressions this category has to offer. If you still hate it, you can sob into your glass while cursing my name, but this one's a winner for me. Cheers!"

3.0,"Oodles of vanilla, toffee and a hint of pine on the nose, which carries through to the palete, melding with caramel, aniseed and a little peppery, really reminiscent of rye bourbon. Medium, rather dry finish (which is surprising for having such a low ABV of 40%) that coats the throat with oaky spices and rye."
4.0,"Very sweet, with a fairly long finish for only an 80 proof blend.   Let it open for a minute or two before going for the nose and you'll be much more pleasantly surprised.  For 18 y/o, it won't club you with oak notes, but they are definitely present.  But the sweetness....it's everywhere.  Creme' brulee and occasionally comes across with a bit of coffee for a tiramisu.    Maple (I mean it IS Canadian).  A very pleasant sipper."
