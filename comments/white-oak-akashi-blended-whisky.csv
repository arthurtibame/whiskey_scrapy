3.0,"With a slight aroma and an extremely mellow taste, this whiskey gose down easy straight, whereas the flavor practically disappears on rocks. As others have said, nothing wrong with the taste, sweet, with a little malt, and very slight smokey finish. I just wish there was a little more to it."

4.0,One of our favorite scotches so far (Japanese or otherwise). Carmel and warm oak balanced with warm Maduro cigar smoke. No harsh alcohol to be found...almost a bourbon with a Ph.D

3.0,Strong oaky with intense high notes on the front end.  Subtle hazelnut and some heat.  Recommend with quality ice block or sphere.

3.0,"After being knocked out for a while by a nasty cold, I'm finally back to tasting whisky. Still had some japanese samples, so might as well go on with them. 
  
  On the nose I get a slightly sweet...bourbon smell. Could be the barrel, but there is also a lot of corn in the smell, together with a bit of spice and some vanilla. 
  
  The taste is semi-sweet corn, vanilla, bit of burn and spice, and some barley taste...do we know the mashbill for this stuff? 
  
  Aftertaste is short and bitter. Not a bad whisky, but also not a good one. Would drink it if offered, but wouldn't go out of my way to get one. So far, japanese whisky has been kinda...disappointing. But I still got the big ones in front of me.

Edit: Rather nice with a ton of apple juice tho...."

2.0,The aroma is alcohol and sharp chemical with undertones of crisp green apple and sweet corn.  It's best if paired with a cigar that tamps down the chemical components.

2.75,"first nose, very alcoholy. first sip has wave of sweetness up front, a bit spicy in the throat - a burn from the alcohol. it's not a super smooth whiskey. on further drinking, i feel like i can taste the cask, a bit of charred oak taste. not my favorite, but granted - it is a young whiskey, probably around 3 or so year old. but it is pretty drinkable, just not so complex and smooth as an aged whiskey or other finer japanese whiskeys."
3.5,"Smells like sake, a little fiery on the tongue, some peat, but enjoyable"
2.5,"So i decided to give this a try because it was a reasonably priced pour in a restaurant in Vegas. Unfortunately it was a pretty big let down, not much flavor beyond the grain that it was made with. pretty young whisky and no reason to go out and search for this one."
4.0,"A sample generously gifted by bourbonjosh24. Nose: Honey sweetness with a hint of smoke and a little bit of a medicinal floral smell that I find pleasant. Background light oak and dried fruit. Flavor: Just like it smells. Lightly sweet with vanilla, light smoke, some medicinal woody smells and dried pears. Finish: Just a little spicy with a medium length finish that fades in to an oaky lightly drying pleasant taste. My favorite Japanese whisky to date. Not super complex but that allows some really nice subtle flavors to come through."
