4.0,"Had just a sample of Glenburgie 10 during whiskey festival but I look forward to give it another try.  Sweet, spicy stuff with a very pleasant finish."

My tasting was oak cask,not sherry

Mediocre -- would not turn down, but would not request it
Innocuous nose
palate tastes of alcohol
Finish is alcohol burn"
3.0,"Somewhat floral, with a little raisin there from the Sherry cask, but otherwise a lot of alcohol hitting the nostrils. Although fairly muted, there is some citrus (meyer lemons), malt and vanilla on the palate. Decent mouthful, but the finish is short. Unfortunately, there isn't much to this whisky. Maybe it needs a bit more ageing... or maybe serve a better purpose in a good old blended Scotch."
