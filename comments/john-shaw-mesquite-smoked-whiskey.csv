3.75,Medium mesquite smoked nose with ripe oranges followed by dried plum.  Light mouthfeel with mesquite flavor throughout.  Sweetness prevails mid way through the sip followed by light chocolate and leather.  Overall a good pour  an unexpected dessert like pallet finishing in a western themed tune.
