4.0,"At the Rod 'n Reel and decided to order a dram.  As described, honey-amber color with a fruity nose with straw, banana and toasted coconut.  Arrives extremely soft and gentle and then opens nicely to spice and sweetness.  The sweetness of creme brûlée with a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg. The palate remains soft throughout, never thinning while holding all the the flavors. As the dram finishes, a slight amount of bitterness, oak and spice remain and hang around for quite some time.  Overall, an easy soft and sweet dram that is balanced very well. Not overly complicated and enjoyable. [87/100][Tasted: 8/22/15]"

4.0,I haven't tried many irish whiskies but I thought I'd buy a bottle of the 18 for St Patrick's day while I was on holidays.  An extremely easy whisky to drink probably the smoothest whisky I've drank to date. So much sweetness from the nose to the palate even my wife commented on the strong taste of honey & caramel. I enjoyed the 18 & will definitely buy another bottle I think it would be a good dram to introduce my freinds to who are interested in exploring my expensive habit. 😆

Sip starts very smooth but light, almost a banana custard before providing notes of clove and very faint undertones of something bright - lemon zest or sumac. Finishes almost smoother than it started. While I don't get a lot of flavor variety out of the 18 year, I appreciate it's relaxed nature sometimes."

This is good - it’s more interesting than standard Jameson but even an 18 year old whiskey can only be so good when it’s been neutered down to 40%. I’ll save my money and grab a Redbreast 12CS or Tyrconnell  16 instead."

4.25,"Frankly sometimes i think Jameson bottles fall from the sky for me to taste them. Tonight i was invited a dram of this baby, the house owner was hyped about it and it really is a good whisky. Very similar to a Macallan 18yo.

Bottled at 40%abv, burnished gold color.

On the nose, creamy. Vanilla ice cream, cinnamon stink, caramel. Lovely.

On the palate, creme brulee, brown sugar and clove. Finish medium, liquorice and spices. 

Overall it didn't change my life but it is a good dram. 88 over 100 my score for it."
