3.5,"Definitely Laphroig. Oily, smoky, peat. Iodine smell is less than the 10 year. I committed a sin and threw an ice cube in it, mellowed out the front nicely but kept the smoke and bite"
4.0,"So soft you don’t feel it hit your tongue. Then it packs some sweet heat, followed by some warmth."

3.75,"I picked up this bottle from K&L Wines in San Francisco in spring 2019, after spending a few days hiking Yosemite with my mom (such a beautiful park, and such a lovely trip).  Therefore, I'll always associate it with fond memories, although I'll try to avoid having those color my views of this whisky.

Guys, this is not your typical Laphroaig at all.  Typical Laphroaig is an ornery black bear coming at you with paws up and the stench of a long winter's hibernation.  And, to be clear, I love that earthy, funky, peaty, smoky medicine.  This is not that Laphroaig.  This is a mule deer at Tuolumne Meadows at the early cusp of spring, sprightly and delicate.  To drop the metaphors and provide some concrete tasting notes, the nose here is as sweet as treacle and whipped cream, and reminds of the first time I tried baba au rhum.  It's also a bit boozy and reticent to give up more notes than that general, almost Highland-like sweetness.  Peat appears when it hits the tongue with its rich and oily texture, and there must be some sherry casks in this batch because it has the citrus and tart candies that I associate with sherry-casked Islay whisky.  The finish is fruit -- pears, grapefruit -- and mellow, herbal peat.  It is not right in my wheelhouse but this is exactly why we buy independent bottles: to see a completely different facet of a distillery that we think we know, and know we love."

4.0,"Nose is typical of a Laphroaig. Highly smoky, peaty, sweet with honey notes that lingers into the finish, light oak and fruit"
