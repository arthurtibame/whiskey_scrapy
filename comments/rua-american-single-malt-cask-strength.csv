4.0,"Rúa is Gaelic for “red head"" and a very literal name for this whiskey made by Great Wagon Road Distilling Co. There is a very noticeable red color to this American Single Malt, though standard bottling tends to be a bit lighter. This particular batch is a special bottling that was aged 5 years as opposed to the normal 2 to 3. A good friend brought it over to share and ended up leaving the bottle as a gift. According to him, this particular batch was also aged in much smaller 5 gallon gallon barrels instead of the usual 25.
Started by Oliver ""Ollie"" Mulligan, Great Wagon Road Distilling began in 2013. The name of the distillery comes from the trail that stretched from Pennsylvania through North Carolina and down to Georgia. It was known as The Great Wagon Road and was used by early colonists and their wagons to travel and settle southern states, including North Carolina.
This is a very hands on craft distillery and apparently Ollie regularly transports water from a spring on his property for use in distilling.
I would like to think that whoever bottled this batch knew exactly how great this particular bottling run was and sampled it liberally. This for sure would explain the handwritten ""92%"" ABV mistake on the label.
On the nose there's a lot of fruit, apples, apricots, sweet berry jam. On the palate much of the same but with caramel, some barrel char, and leather. Finishes with baking spices, black pepper, and sour apple. This is one of the best American Single Malts I've personally ever sampled. Absolutely worth picking up their standard bottling even if it may not be nearly as great as this batch."

3.5,"On a recent trip to Charlotte, NC I made a point to stop by this Distillery to see what they were all about having really enjoyed their flagship Whiskey (Rua Single Malt) on previous trips.
I have a passion for American Whiskey in general and do really like to sample what craft distilleries are doing all across the nation. Sometimes you overpay for what you get (well let's be honest that is more the norm unfortunately) however, every once in a while you get a really pleasant surprise. This is one of those times!
So for background this is a cask strength version (112 proof) of the Rua (see my previous review for details) with the exception that it's aged for 3 years exclusively in Baltic Porter Casks from a neighboring local brewery (Fat Boy from OMB for those who know the area). The results are both unique and intriguing. Let's dive in:
Upon entry it's rich and soft with big honey, graham crackers and malt notes. These then move to caramel, toffee and chocolate covered raisins. The porter influence is very pronounced but in balance. The finish is long with more red fruits and a boozy chocolate malt note that lingers. 
Beer finished Whiskey's are tricky. Most I personally dislike but this one somehow pulls it off. It needs air to open up as drinking it too quickly you will be overpowered by the porter notes. 
Now at $39.99 for 375ml it's not exactly cheap, however, I can safely say I have never had another Whiskey like it. If you happen to live in Charlotte or will be visiting, look these guys up!
Cheers all and TGIF!"
