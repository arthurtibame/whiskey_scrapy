3.0,"Stop number 89 on the SDT is Tamnavulin. Another relatively unknown Speyside distillery, Tamnavulin is used mostly in blends, but they do have a range of their own single malts. This NAS was matured in American oak (most likely ex bourbon) and finished in sherry casks. Bottled at 40% ABV and is surely chill filtered with colorant added giving it a dark amber color. 

Strong sherry up front on the nose with oak, cherries and brown sugar. A definite chalky/talc note with a small hit of sulphur. Milk chocolate, hazelnut, caramelized peaches, grilled plums and more oak. The oak is well done, warm and inviting. Raisins, dates, some honey, cinnamon and cocoa powder. Maple syrup, vanilla, oranges, apricots, walnuts and a hint of coffee. That sulphur note comes back strong and takes over at times. It really detracts from an otherwise solid nose. 

The palate is lighter than expected as far as the sherry goes, I guess that’s to be expected at 40%. Oak, pears, apples, brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. It turn sulphuric and has some bitter nuts. A little pepper, coffee, maple, anise and a light mint. Again the sulphur detracts from the experience. 

A medium light bodied mouthfeel that is mouth coating and dry. 
The finish is medium long with sherry, sulphur, nuts and light oak. 

On first impressions I thought I was in for a toned down Tamdhu, but upon further inspection I found lots of faults. The nose had a ton of complexity especially considering the legal minimum ABV, but  it just didn’t have that quality feel to it. The palate was a bigger let down with the sulphur ruining much of it. I can see plenty of scotch lovers getting on good terms with this one, but it’s just not one that I would seek out. I have to say, at $36 it’s tough to beat its value. I was going to give a 3.25, but the price point bumps it to a 3.5. Thanks to @LeeEvolved for the sample. 
Cheers"

2.0,"So, I’m getting a jump start on our group trade sampling for our penultimate round.  This is actually quite an exciting round IMO- we are mostly down to distilleries that aren’t available in North American or the United States.  This bottle, Tamnavulin Double Cask, had to be purchased from an online store based out of London just to be included here.  It’s a NAS whisky and while I’m not expecting anything incredible flavor-wise- it is cool knowing most average Joe’s here in the states can’t get their hands on this one.  But, then again, we live in a global economy now, so...

Let’s talk about Tamnavulin a bit first:  they were founded in 1966 and have been primarily used in Whyte & Mackay and Mackinlay’s blends.  They were owned by the same group that owned Bruichladdich, Jura and Tullibardine.  They closed in 1995, but were refurbished and reopened by United Spirits/UBG Group in 2007 and are currently managed by Whyte and Mackay.  They started offering single malts again in 2016.  This NAS is bottled at 40% ABV and is from batch #308 (wow, high batch number for a relatively small distillery that’s not super widely distributed...oh well).

Double Cask is primarily aged in American Oak before being transferred to Sherry Casks for an undisclosed length of time for finishing.  It’s a rich caramel in color (no indication of chill filtering or added color, so I’d assume it is).  It makes some oily, yet undefined legs in the Glencairn.

The nose is definitely an indicator of young whisky, sherried oak barrels and is kind of similar to Tamdhu, initially.  Sadly, the sherry notes fade over time.  The palate is somewhat weak due to the low ABV.  There’s more sherry sweetness at play but not much oak.  Weak is the theme here.  The finish is medium-short, sweet and oaky before ending up dry.  I guess I’ve grown to expect this from a NAS and at a price point of $36USD (sigh).

Overall, it’s average on it’s best day.  Mundane on its worst.  An interesting attempt, but there’s not enough here to make me want to look into an older, age statement bottle either.  At least the group can tick off a distillery that’s not easily attainable.  They need to give the ABV a boost for starters and dump the blend mentality IMO.  2.5-2.75 stars.  Cheers and thanks for reading."

3.0,Very light speyside whisky with multi fruit fragrance and sweetness of liquorise (Réglisse) like it :-)
3.25,Fruity. Pineapple. And light. Liquorice!
3.25,"No age statement. No exciting heritage. But an actual explosion of aromas on the nosing. Prevalent marzipan and delicate marmalade. Nose flows through sweet apples, pineapples and citrus fruits which are found back in the tasting. Dark chocolate comes aroud the corner with a subtle spice on the tongue. Marvellous!"
2.75,"Honey, sweet, doesn't linger. Smells good though"
4.0,"Caramel, toffee, and burnt sugar on the nose. Hints of barley and anise. Cocoa and caramel on the pallet, accompanied by oak and Cajun spices. Aftertaste develops vanilla and oak, with grassy flavors, rather short in duration. A couple of water drops opens up caramel nose even more, and floral taste dominates on the pallet. Hints of bread and more grassy flavors. Overall very pleasant and rather smooth."

2.0,"A nice intense nose that brings dried banana chips, vanilla custard, subtle lemon, more cream, and floral properties, like jasmine. The palate is hot for 40%, but it's on the nice sweet end, reminiscent to a Monkey Shoulder blend. I am not sure if that's good though since we are comparing that to this single malt. The finish is sadly non-existent on this one with a thin and dry mouthfeel. 2.5 for me. The theme is ""The Sound of Settling"" by Death Cab for Cutie. Thanks for the sip @LeeEvolved!"

3.0,"Yes, it’s a Tuesday. But it’s the day before the Fourth. No work tomorrow, so I will pour a sample which was provided by @LeeEvolved who has been downright generous with all his samples; as well as all the other members of the SDT: @PBMichiganWolverine and @Generouy_Paul and @Telex. 

The nose begins with citrus with pink grapefruit with honey (it’s how I used to eat the in my youth).  A toasted bread with orange marmalade is what is transformed (or is it transscented) in time. As it settles in, the sherry qualities become predominant: pecans, raisins, dates, plumbs, cinnamon, brown sugar.  A small amount semisweet dark chocolate surfaces in due time. 

The body is lightweight and thin which causes any flavor to fade rather quickly.  In small flashes are vanilla, demerara sugar, apples, cinnamon, black pepper, and oak.  Sugar and spice in a small dose. 

What remains on the palate, briefly, is drying oak and cinnamon. 

What tends to make a great/exceptional whisky is the full experience from start to finish (probably stating the obvious). The nose transports you somewhere, the palate jettisons you into orbit and the finish brings you back smoothly.  Most whiskies often fail by not being able to deliver two or even all three of these goals. This Tamnavalin delivers a nice nose but struggles to complete the other portions.  Still, though, it not unpleasant. It’s just leaves you expecting more; wanting more. [84/100][Tasted: 7/3/18]"
2.0,"This pour is courtesy of @LeeEvolved as part of our round 6 of the SDT tour ( one more round to go, and we’ll have covered very active distillery in Scotland).  For $36, you can do a lot worse for NAS, or you can do a lot better if you go outside Scotland single malt.  Not bad for a single malt...weak nose typical of the dried fruit from sherry cask; taste of quickly fading hazelnuts and oak.  A bit of marzipan.  Wow..the finish is bitter.  Lemon rinds.  Honestly..if you really want a single malt $36 isn’t too much of a price for this.  That said, there’s nothing really noteworthy.  You have other options:  fork over a bit more and get a damn good blend ( Compass Box core ranges, the amazing JW Green), or get American ( Rittenhouse rye, Wyoming whiskey); heck..push comes to shove...walk over to the wine aisle and grab an amazing Oregon Pinot while saving $20 off the $36 price of this.  In summary:  not bad...but you can do better for $36-40 range"
3.5,"GP is on the money; Sherry oak, cherry, brown sugar and sulphur with a nice caramelly viscousness. Now I like a bit of sulphur..nothing like a bit of worm tub action to get my pulse racing (yes Mortlach and Craigellachie I'm looking at you). The sulphur note however trends to bitterness which I am very unforgiving on - lemony flavour and bitterness are no nos for me and the after taste smacks of ethanolly, citrusey bitterness. Still it's cheap at under $50 and so 3.5 for me and rounding up to a 4 as after this I had a 21 year Tormore and thought compared to that this is much cheaper and better."

1.75,"The expert tasting notes are right on point. I found the American oak wood bitterness are more quite prominent. I was looking for sherry notes since it's double cask but they are quite far away in the background. My guess is they only sit in the sherry cask for about less than 6 month, what a shame."

3.25,"I have a bit of a soft spot for Tamnavulin Double Cask.  It was a major component of the blended whisky Whyte & MacKay that was my gateway into whisky as a student in the early 90s.  

It’s alcohol heavy up front but it moves into sweet caramel, with a load of raisin and plums.  It has a nice long finish that starts to taste more like a rum.

An easy drinking whisky."

3.0,"The nose perceives a note of disinfectant, a not very pleasant background that remains all the time. Banana, vanilla, caramel, honey, a pinch of cinnamon, in a sweet but flat profile, lashed by a sour and vaguely lemonade whiff.
In the mouth, the sherried profile prevails, which soon dissolves in a rather monochromatic alcohol bath, with candied orange, cinnamon and honey that sprout with little conviction. On the length, the wood tends to be felt with a certain intrusiveness.
Medium-short finish, of wood and cinnamon and a lot, too much alcohol."
