I taste turpentine-yes floor cleaner. Its thin, not thick, and it taste like it was made by a guy in his garage, not a premier distillery. I love Handy, i will never pay more than $5/pour for this. I don’t like the MSRP much less the aftermarket for his one! 

Sorry BTAC, you are not perfect."

4.75,Smooth but hard to tell the difference between this and baby saz.
4.5,"Apricot to the nose. Vanilla sweet, maybe hidden licorice and a smooth rye finish."
2.25,Leather finish with diluted oak
2.5,Watery leathery oak.

5.0,"That's right, it's haircut time again and of course I have to make a pitstop at my local Whiskey Bar and look at what I stumbled upon! $25 for a solid 2 oz pour. Absolutely no hesitation in paying that to taste this unicorn! 
Upon entry it's thick, honey, butterscotch, citrus rind and cherries. Very viscous and mouth coating. Mid pallette has a lovely rye spice with oak, old leather leading to a lonnngggg finish that is oak, leather driven and then the cherries return. Sensational. Completely blows away any rye I have ever had. I am elated to have tasted this one as it's one of the rarer bottles within the BTAC collection (just 2,500 bottles 2018 released) If you can find a pour buy it. You will not be dissapionted!"

4.75,Smooth with slight heat. Smell and taste of sweet rye mint vanilla.
4.75,FUCK. YES.
4.25,"The color is a vivid amber that thickly coats the glass with the gentlest of movement of the glass. The nose is strong but not overwhelming with floral rye, sweet fruit, leather and a bit of apple pie spice. The palate is somewhat dry, with the floral rye completely filling the mouth, while oak and leather follow, along with hints of vanilla, smoke and baking spices finishing it off. The finish is medium long with the rye staying put, while the rest of palate melds together and fades away. Despite being 18 years old, oak only plays a minor character in this whiskey making it the perfect sipper for a well aged rye."
3.75,"For me, not as nice as the Handy, but a very different Rye. Softer."
4.5,Delicious.

4.5,So smooth. Rye. Oak. Faint sweetness. Just goes down so easily.
