1.0,"Just awful. Cloying sweetness reminiscent of pixie sticks.  Luckily, I only had a 1oz. Sample."
2.5,"I like TBWC but it really is starting to irritate me how they don't publish cask info. Why the secret? Anyhow enough of my pedanticness. I am starting to sympathize with those on the virtual whiskey pilgrimage: LeeW, GP, PBM, Telex, Scott and others. I thought to avoid their similar fate by trying to get a good example of each distillery. This was rated an average of nearly 5 stars on MoM by 5 reviews.....whaaat! This is definitely my least favourite of the seven or so I've had this day. Sickly sweet cough mixture. 2.5 I'm giving this. But it is in balance I suppose (once extensively watered). And cheap... $60 for a 27 year old must be the best year to price ratio I've ever seen. Not enough to save it from a downward 2 rating."
