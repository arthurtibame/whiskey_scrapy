3.0,The sherry is front and centre but it doesn’t tame the traditional Irish Whiskey spice and floral/oak. The sherry finish is a welcome change. If it was half the price and/or smoother it would be worth purchasing. $99 in Ontario.

4.0,Super malty and without the grain alcohol flavor that usually predominates  Irish Whiskies.  The sherry finish makes for a full and sweet finish.
3.0,Note a whiskey with a sting flavor. Has a very sweet aroma probably owing to the sherry cask. A delicate flavor lands on the palate but is quick to escape.

4.0,Actually tastes a lot like aberlour abunadh with a lower abv. Strangely I get citrus and grapefruit on the nose with a backbone of dark cherry. Taste is similar with chocolate and dark fruit. I really don't notice any of the usual Irish flavors... maybe the sherry influence overshadows it.

4.0,"Prologue: This is the first Tyrconnell I ever tasted and believed until now it far surpassed the 10 yr. Madeira casked.

Nose: Harsher and more alcoholic/wood stain before sitting. After sitting at least an hour it's much more sweet and fruity but quite woody as before. 

Taste: Both this and the Madeira casked taste though they could have soaked in a barrel full of antique chairs. Much sweeter after sitting awhile, definitely equivalent to the Madiera before sitting.

Appearance: Darker orange-to-yellow urine, as after a high protein meal with only a moderate amount of fluids.

Finish: Pretty much as in the taste notes, less strong alcohol and more wood than the Madiera. More like Macallan Edition 4, which I love, than anything else I've had, though certainly a good bit less complex and satisfying.

Mouthfeel: Didn't pay attention. It's fine.

Overall: Now I will forever think of it as a poor man's decent substitute Macallan Edition 4. After sitting, it FAR surpasses Madiera casked 10 yr."

2.75,"I did not like this one as much as the great reviewer @Soba45 (if you are not already following him you should be). It's very different from the Irish Whiskey I have had to date. Distinct cereal malt notes dominate. The Sherry influence isn't overly pronounced to me, although you do get some red fruits mid pallette and finish. It's got a bit of spice on the finish and is a tad harsh going down. It's by far the least sweet of the Irish Whiskey's I have had to date and is also by far the most expensive ($82 a bottle). I much prefer both the Green Spot and Redbreast 12 over this one. 
It's not bad by any means, just a poor value for the price. 
Cheers all!"

4.0,"Interesting this one is so lowly rated.  3 of us tried it tonight and quite enjoyed it. Slightly rougher on the aftertaste but but of flavour, sherry currents and more. Nice drop and a 4."
