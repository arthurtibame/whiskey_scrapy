3.5,"хорошая, но много вино не добавляет"
4.0,"Stronger on the nose than the ABV would suggest. Sweet honey bbq smoke on the nose, development sweet smooth honey and enough smoke mixed in to enjoy it, finish is a little spiky with salt, brine and a heather smoke finish that slowly fades away. Think a softer version of Port Charlotte."

4.0,"Heavily peated, some smoke and yet... Sweet !
matured in Sauternes wine cask, this Whisky is very rich. very soft on the nose, the sauterne notes come out clearly. 
but on the taste , some notes of raisins and honey show up on the palate before the peat kicks in. the finish is long lasting , sweet and quite oily. 
this is not for everyone, I had a great time tasting it but its quite complex and will please only the ones who are looking for something different... dare I say unique ?"
