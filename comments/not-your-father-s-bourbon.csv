1.5,Strong vanilla. Good in a dessert mix drink or to shoot. Not a good sipping drink.
0.5,Absolutely horrible. Do not buy. This should not even qualify to have bourbon on its label. It tastes like I’m sipping straight vanilla extract.

null,This can't be bourbon. Way too sweet and oily. Sampled a friend's bottle and we both poured it out.
0.5,Too sweet for me and I suspect many others who enjoy bourbon. The sweetness clashed with the alcohol and left a bad lingering taste.

1.25,"It’s just to sweet for me. If kinda gives off a fake taste, you don’t feel like your drinking bourbon. Not a fan, and won’t buy it again."
