4.0,"Neat.  Not a Bevmo pick, but I believe this sample is 6 years MGP.  I get a lot of spearmint up front with a layer of oak behind it.  Vanilla and cherry.  It’s hot on the nose.  Baking spices present themselves as it opens up.

Nice, thick texture.  Tons of brown sugar up front on the tongue.  Spearmint and oak dominate the taste just like the nose.  Vanilla and cherry behind that.

It’s a very enjoyable dram but outside my top 10 MGP.  It’s probably the age.  That spearmint note is not one I associate with MGP but most I have is in the 10-12  year range.  Enjoyed it but I would not but a bottle of it for more than $50.  Pretty sure this can go for twice that."
