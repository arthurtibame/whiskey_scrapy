2.5,"A softer style Bourbon, this is a gateway Bourbon. It is very affordable and is a straightforward and simple drink that is good, but lacks deep flavor or complexity. Its color is light as it appears that Willett aged it just long enough to turn light a light rust. On the nose, caramel, oak, vanilla, and just a hint of floral notes. There is the flavor of new wood and a butterscotch finish."

3.5,"I'm happily shocked by this Bourbon.  My concern with Willet starting their own distillery and producing their own juice was that the taste of their Whiskey was going to be completely different from what I'm used to from them.  

I like Willett's Pot Still Reserve to me I get cinnamon candy/red hots on the  nose and the palate which I really enjoy and no other Bourbon/Whiskey has that to me.  So my concern with the new in house juice was this would be lost due to different production facilities, storage location, storage conditions, etc.  

But after trying this Old Bardstown it is still there.  I don't know how they did it but they did.  This immediately on first nosing had that familiar smell of Willet Pot Still Reserve and on tasting it is there on the palate too.  This smells and tastes to me like a slightly weaker Willet Pot Still Reserve at less than half the cost.

It made me immediately get up and poor the Pot Still Reserve for a side by side.  After the side by side it confirmed my first assessment.  It is Pot Still Reserve slightly turned down but the nose and flavor is there which surprised me and put my concerns at ease."

3.25,"Running low on your Bookers, Bakers and candle waxed Makers?  Need a quick bottle off the shelf(no not the top one) that will do the job and NOT dent the wallet too severely?  You might want to try Old Bardstown, Willett seems to have gotten something right and put it on the market ready to go for the average buyer.   Of course anybody can put a ""Kentucky"" label on a bottle and claim they are selling something ""authentic"" yet the folks rebooting the Willett family distillery aren't short changing with this somewhat less than upscale offering. 

Labeled as ""straight bourbon whiskey"" you get a spicey and sweet blend of some traditional bourbon along with a hint of oak notes and leather finish.  Certainly some similarity to the well known Willett genie bottle of Pot Still Reserve.  What might be more notable is the lack of green, un-aged mash bitters so common with anything new on the market. 

A 90 proofer that gives something not watered down, Old Bardstown is well named, not a bottle I was looking for when I found it, might remind some of an old flame, ""I wasn't looking for her when she found me"".  I'm going on record to call this the ""value bourbon release of the year"".   A nice bourbon worth giving a spin!"
3.5,cinnamon on the nose and cinnamon and peanut on the palate.  The spiciness reminds me of rye.  Medium finish. Water tampers down the spice and all the interesting flavor

3.75,"Caramel. Lots of caramel on the nose right away, and all throughout the taste and finish. Yes, you'll get the vanilla and oak notes that are right out of the barrel, but it's pretty clear that this is a 'no age statement bourbon.'
Now, is that a bad thing? No. Sure, it's clearly their entry level bourbon, yet it's more than capable of standing on its own. I feel like that this is Willett's answer to Buffalo Trace - though it's up to the individual drinker if they nailed it or not."

2.5,"BACKGROUND: Old Bardstown is produced by the Willet Distillery, which originally opened in 1935 - two years after the end of Prohibition - and continued operating through the mid-1970s, when it converted to the production of ethanol fuel.

Norwegian Even Kulsveen acquired the distillery in 1984, changed its name to Kentucky Bourbon Distillers, and served as a bottling plant for other brands.

The facility turned its focus to bourbon production and marketing in 2012, first by acquiring product from contract distillers and, eventually, making its own whiskey.

In addition to the 90 proof Old Bardstown that I sampled, the distillery produces a 101 proof Old Bardstown Estate Bottled and a 100 Proof Old Bardstown Bottled in Bond.

The bourbon retails for around $24, and is aged at least four years as determined by its lack of age statement.

NOSE: The nose offers an odd combination of cherries - not cherry cough syrup like some bourbons but like you stuck your nose in a jar of maraschino cherries - and hay.

PALATE: Like the nose, the palate is very cherry-forward.  Some butterscotch - not caramel but butterscotch - is also present, but it is buried in the jar of maraschino cherries.

FINISH: Old Bardstown offers a short finish with a most unpleasant grassy note that hangs in the back of the throat.  The grassy note becomes more obvious with each subsequent sip.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: Old Bardstown is a very one-dimensional bourbon, and even that one dimension ain’t a great one.  This bourbon is obviously more at home in a rocks glass mixed with something else rather than standing alone in a glencairn."
3.0,"Actually the 101 proof. Herbal, grassy aroma with a sort of sour fruit flavor."

3.5,"A classic bourbon taste. Vanilla, Carmel, and oak. Very much a classic! Nice to get back to the basics. Good introduction to bourbon."
4.25,"Hints of Fanta soda, hazelnut , and Carmel   Love it and for the price- incredible."
3.0,"To be honest I had low hopes for this “budget” bourbon.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It was light tasting, hints of cherry perhaps. Short finish. If given, I would drink again. Thanks James"
4.0,"Bang for the Buck contender in the $20 fight.  Consistent, affordable, dynamic.  Great, balanced, Sour Mash punch and flavour profile.  Fave.  Beats the shit out of more expensive bourbons.  Age some yourself."

3.25,"Nose- dark chocolate 
Body- dark chocolate gives ways to cherries, sweet grass and a hint of cinnamon 
Finish- the dark cherry continues which I really like but there is a bitterness I don’t love 

Great for the money."
