4.75,"Smooth and delicious, if you are a fan of rye's this one is not to be missed."
4.5,"Nose is luscious and sweet. Apricot, vanilla, white chocolate, orange blossom honey, cherry cola, birch bark, cinnamon, white pepper, allspice, and more. 

Whoa, smoke initially but quickly turns to vanilla root beer, apricots with whipped cream and caramel, black pepper, and more smoke on the finish. Pretty sweet rye with that really interesting smokiness up front and at the back end, love it.

Finish is med+ with nice body and almost no burn but it does make my mouth tingle in a very pleasant way. This is a complex rye through and through. Being a wine lover as well, I appreciate the Sauternes barrel influence and the nuanced sweet complexities it adds."
4.5,"Simply delicious. Nose of ripe peach/pear/apricot (stone fruits), vanilla, honey, almost creme brulee like (heavily sauterne influenced), rye spice. Has a silky, rich, soft, and velvety mouthfeel. Attack of sweet apricot that eases gently into a crescendo of rye spice, and sweet red licorice. The finish is warm and sweet with red  licorice and ginger dominating with a hint of barrel notes. Nice rye punch to match the sweetness of the cask finishes. One of my favorite finished ryes."

4.0,"Really powerful, like the stuff that grows hair on your chest...which is quite surprising considering the  ABV.  Nose is amazingly sweet, the first taste comes out spicy with a long finish.  So---is it worth the price?  I'm not a rue person, so  probably not for me. But if you enjoy high quality rye----then yes"

5.0,Sauternes didn’t come through as much as I’d hoped but the port and Madeira shined. Finishing in those barrels took some sting out of the spice and brought delicious fruit bites to the top. I’m not usually a rye guy but this bottle was fantastic.🥃
