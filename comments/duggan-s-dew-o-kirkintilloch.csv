2.0,Not good
3.0,"Nose gives away a lot of speyside malt in thr blend. Tastes that way too. No real peat to speak of. Really not a bad blend, especially at $15. Definitely worth the asking price."
1.25,"Have looked at the bottom shelf scotch and wondered if any of it was drinkable or is it like wretched Canadian whisky. They only seem to come in giant 1.75 bottles which is a big commitment if its garbage. Luckily this was available in 50ml size so I figured lets spin the wheel. Poured neat, decent legs and hey its 86.8 pf so there's that. Nose is weak with ethanol, a wisp of distant fruit and lack of malt. Better than expected mouth feel leads to palate of generic light sweetness and malt with oaky char. Has grain harshness but isn't too bad. Finishes with quick grainy alcohol and char. Overall not a lot of flavor or much of an experience but better than cheap Canadian and might work as a mixer. I will not be buying a handle of this or any other bottom barrel options but its not horrid...........62/100........its drinkable I just don't wanna be the one doin it"
2.0,It's a fighter. Has an extra burn with no sweetness to hold it down. Like Dewar's with a shot of really bad vodka in it.
3.75,Way better than the price point would suggest.

4.0,"A very tasty and sweet blend (without overmuch graininess) and a real bargain, almost at the level of Smuggler, which sets the standard. V nice w water only. A savvy scotch-blend drinker would prefer its taste to any number of more expensive anodyne blends."

1.0,"Harsh.  If you are a scotch drinker, not sure why you would be this cheap.  Probably not as bad as I'm passing it off to be, but do yourself a favor and take a step up."
