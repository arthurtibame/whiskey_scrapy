I do find it odd they use such a mild scotch for house stark."

4.0,Caramel apple to start and ends with the addition of heavy wintery spice. Pretty damn good for the price!
4.0,Honeyed pome fruits up front and a spicy finish.
3.75,Cooling taste? Good flavor. Sweet but not in a fruity way.

3.25,"This is a fine whisky on its own. Creamy, malty mouthfeel and a classic Highland smell on the nose.  The whisky is oily, with an extra long finish. I like mine with just a splash of water, as it brings out a few more of the more honeyed qualities.  I also like the 43% ABV, as some of the whiskys in the GOT set are bottled at 40% presumably to maximize profit, so kudos to Dalwhinnie and Diageo for not caving in this one. 

Where this one looses points is the GOT tie in. This is a nice, sunshiney whisky and I don’t buy the House Stark tie in. The bit on the tube about Dalwhinnie being the highest distillery in Scotland and using only juice that was only distilled in winter is all well and good, but I was hoping for something a little more hearty for the Stark clan, like an Ardbeg or Highland Park (neither of which are owned by Diageo...). Still, a good dram if you can get it for a good deal like I did. Not sure if I’d pay retail for this one."

2.75,"Nose: Immediate malt, sugar, honey and green apples. Nuts, perhaps walnut, with a strong oak barrel presence, with a slight hint of banana and milk chocolate.

Palate: Immediate short-lasting honey followed by sugar and oak as the predominant flavour, giving a overly dry feeling on the tongue, with an underwhelming apple taste. Nuts follow through with a slight cocoa taste.

Finish: A short finish, very dry with the presence of oak and slight spice."

3.25,"Nose of honey, apple, grains. The taste is medium to light bodied with a honey flavor. It has a resinous quality and some spicy. Finish is spicy honey with grains and maybe a hint of ginger."
2.75,"The Starks may yet claim the Iron Throne, but they won’t be winning Game of Drams. Despite its flavors opening up considerably after an hour exposed to the elements, Winter’s Frost left me cold. It eventually yielded some malty, nutty notes and a pleasantly creamy aftertaste with a hint of apple pie and nutmeg, but it’s all a little muted, like a watery Benromach 10. Pleasant enough, but I wouldn’t march north for it."
2.75,"Sour apple on the nose with a polar opposite whiff of honey. On the palate there is a mix of spice with vanilla, a medium finish of a fruit basket."

3.75,"I was surprised at how smooth a gimicky and less expensive scotch would be. My experience with cheaper alcohols has been an off-putting ethanol smell and taste, but this doesn't have either. It's sweet, light, and smooth. It's probably too light for me and doesn't have enough complexity, but it's a surprising good scotch. (Unlike the Johnny White Walker which is disgusting.) Of the scotches we've tried, it's my wife's favorite."
3.0,"Scapa Skiren was better for me tasting parallel. Spicy on nose, really spicey on the palate, short spicey finish, with hint of sweetness lingering for longer.
2.75 due to price, otherwise it would be 3.25 for me."
3.5,"Sweet aroma. Tastes of pear, honey, and apples. Not very much smokiness, as a result it is very smooth to drink. It’s good, but I would like more flavor and complexity."

3.5,"The last in my finds from a fruitful weekend in SoCal was not Bourbon but an allocated single malt. I am thoroughly enjoying the Lag GOT and outside of the Talisker GOT, this one seemed to have the most positive feedback. So for $29 I thought to myself why the heck not. I have yet to try any offerings from Dalwhinnie so I really have no dram of reference. I have had some experience with Highland Malts and find them to be pleasant summer drams. For $29 honestly I am just hoping that it's as good or better than Glenlevit 12. So lets find out...
Upon entry is very rich and sweet with graham crackers, dried orchard fruits dipped in honey. Mid palette adds an array of spices and vanilla leading to a spiced apple pie finish! it's a medium length. Decent balance and thoroughly enjoyable. 
It's definitely better than the Glenlevit 12 and for $29 it's a solid malt. Not too complex, but seriously drinkable!
For the price it's a solid buy and one I expect will be in heavy rotation this summer. 
Cheers all!"

Enfin le premier scotch de cette distribution élogieuse. Un départ plutôt lent avec la maison Stark. Je me serais attendu à quelque chose de plus intense comme cette famille nordique. Un bon petit whisky, sans plus."

4.0,"Here i start my reviews on some of the Game of Thrones Whiskies that recently appeared on the market. 

House Stark, from Dalwhinnie (actually called ""Dalwhinnie Winter's Frost""), is a NAS whisky that tells the story of the Starks, one of the most important families on Hbo's tv series ""GOT"". 

Actually, the whisky is pretty nice, nothing to die for, the box where the bottle comes is a lot more beautiful than the actual bottle. 

On the nose, super fruity. Red Apples, Gerber Porridge, prunes and apricots. 

On the palate it is a little straightforward, but easy drinkable. A little watery, tastes like sider and hints of ginger. 

Aftertaste is a little smoky and some toasted oak notes appear. 

Overall this is the most average whisky ever. It tastes good and works well. Not expensive and collectable. 82 over 100 seems fit for it."
3.0,"I thought this qould be a bit more than i expected. In the end i was a bit disappointed. The nose is good, with smoke, wood and peat. Peat...yes. the front palate is solid, but it drips off fast and doesnt come back until the very end after you swallow. Im not sure I'd buy this. There just isn't enough consistency to it."

3.75,"A very mild sweet scotch with a slight burn on the finish.  Notes of apples, pear, green grass and vanilla.  Easy sipper.  On the packaging it says Naturally it’s best served chilled or over ice.  I drank it neat.  I’m afraid you would loose the taste served over ice."

4.25,"Nose: Sweetness of honey and fruit, slightly smokey, and a little malt.

Palate: Honey comes through followed by a little smoke and spice. Smooth and fruity as well. Hint of vanilla/maple syrup.

Finish: Very smooth. Vanilla stronger on the finish. Malty as well. Did not expect this much sweetness but I am very happy about it!

Overall Thoughts: This is my second Game Of Thrones bottle I’ve tasted and so far they’re 2 for 2. Very enjoyable and mellow. The smokiness and the malt is excellent. I’m very pleased that my allegiance to The North has proven to be the right decision."
