2.25,"Nose: light, simple sweetness of spun sugar, honey, light buttery note, spring orchard flowers, herbal but faint. Taste: similar to the nose but with a more forward on the herbal quality, almost a slight bittering note. Some sharp, peppery notes. Sweetness subdued a little more than what I’d like. Overall, an ok Irish whisky for the buck. Works well as a mixer, not as nice neat. Decent budget whisky to have for quantity sake."

2.25,"You bought this whiskey at Costco remember? Look at the label it says Kirkland, what were you thinking? I mean there you were minding your own business pushing your shopping cart and you see this big old bottle of whiskey and you see the price and you went WHOA what a deal! So what do you do, you pick it up and put it in your cart next to the 2 gallon tub of mayonnaise. Well you might as well open that tub of mayonnaise and fix yourself a sandwich to go with that whiskey because they’re both going to be around for quite a while."
