1.0,"I bet the barrel tastes good. But seriously, are they using this to make beer or vice versa? Not as bad as the critics say. I taste vanilla and oak, the finish is smooth but there's a hollowness throughout. Something is missing and it's probably with the devil or the angels. Needs more bourbon and less woody water. Many sips later, the pepper emerges."

4.0,Sweet. Molasses and toffee with citrus around the edges. Some heat and spice throughout.
3.0,"The smell is sweet with a hint of citrus. A long inhale tickles the nostrils in a pleasant manner. The Dragon's Milk has made quit the impact on the aroma.

Neat it is dull in the beginning, but lingers on the sides of the tongue afterwards. It does not burn going down, but it has an aftertaste that is not as pleasant as I would like. It transitions to the back of the tongue and throat. It is actually a bit dull. Heavy on the tongue but not a very satisfying finish.

On ice, or with some water, the Dragon's Milk comes out much more. The taste is more pleasant than the neat option. It hits the back of the tongue and lingers a bit, but is an easier, milder drink."

I understand the beer barrel concept here, but it's just too unpleasant and uninteresting on the pallet to justify a place in a whiskey collection. The burn pushes back on your nose like a shockwave, and the general smell is of cheap bottom shelf liquor. Go figure. Try it once, then do better."

3.0,"Nose - Mostly a soft vanilla, hint of cinnamon Biscoff cookies, light syrupy sweet mint?
Taste - Initially thin mouthfeel that transitions to a creamy and drying mouthfeel, sweet vanilla, hint of cinnamon Biscoff cookies, light milk chocolate malt.
Finish - Light lingering gentle cinnamon spice, vanilla again, white chocolate sweet.
Score - 80/100
Final Thoughts - As expected from the proof, a bit thin and one dimensional. I think the bourbon is quite young, but the extra finishing in the barrel aged stout barrels does wonders for this as I think it softened up the young spirit considerably and made it quite palatable. A vanilla milk chocolate malt with a hint of cinnamon dominates, but that's a bit of what you get in their Dragon's Milk stout as well. Overall a great pairing with their stout for a perfect boilermaker (their Dragon's Milk is 11%ABV). In fact, I could see this pairing very well with many other stouts as it exhibits a nice soft chocolately malt."

Reading the notes and the tasting notes, I gather 1) Some of y'all paid much more for it than I did and 2) the the tasting notes are a bit excessive for a mid shelf bourbon. It's not woodford reserve or even knob creek, but it's not Old Crow either. I paid closer to Old Crow. I can understand reviewing a single malt, but a mid range bourbon?"

The effect of the stout barrel shifts the profile into an unusual direction that makes it unique. I recommend trying a taste before buying your own bottle. For me, I'd take another bottle, but I have a lot more bourbons to try before I would cycle back to this one."

3.0,"Review transfer from Barreled from December 2016

I'm reviewing this bourbon at my stepbrothers housewarming party. Drinking it out of a giant wine glass so I won't be able to properly review the nose. Here we go anyways. 

This bourbon is aged new American oak barrels for ""several years"" then is finished in beer barrels that were previously bourbon barrels, a nice cycle. 

The color is a mahogany amber and it comes in at 40% ABV. No word if it's colored or chill filter d but I would guess it's not colored. 

The nose is very reminiscent of the beer it once housed, New Holland Dragon Milk, a great bourbon barrel aged beer.  Tons of vanilla stout, some caramel and cinnamon. It's a very smooth nose but not too complex. 

The palate is silky smooth with a ton of caramel and stout flavors. Again it's not complex and could have used a few more years in the barrel. 

Overall it's great for an everyday sipper when you aren't looking to dissect your drink. For $30 it's a great value too. 3.25"

Nose is heavily influenced by the beer barrels, with sweetness from the sweet stout barrels prevalent.  Flavor is initially soft and sweet, with a burst of whiskey heat coming in the finish.  Not an amazing dram, but the beer finish makes for an interesting bourbon, especially for beer lovers.  And at $33/bottle, affordable enough to try."

First sip is mildly oaky, less sweet than the nose, followed by a definite flash of stout  beer. Following sips reveal chocolate notes, as well as very mild nutty flavor. Mouthfeel is just a little thin but not unpleasantly so. Finish is just a little astringent, with the stout flavor coming back for a short linger with the chocolate notes. Overall, probably not an everyday sipper, but not bad at all, especially for a more unique chocolate/stout profile change-up at a lower price."

3.75,"Don’t agree with the professional review attached to this expression. Its a light spirit heavier on hoppiness than corn or oak or vanilla. Pleasantly sweet, with a nose like bubble gum at first sniff. Unique and enjoyable if you like hoppy beers. Paired with a chocolate it gains a pleasant astringency and strips off the cloying sweetness on the palate. I wish I had taken the risk and purchased the 750 rather than the 375 size, hopefully I’ll be able to find it again locally."
