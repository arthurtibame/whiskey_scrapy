4.25,"This is the mattar paneer curry of whiskies: peas, cheese and a mortar full of spices. The peas and cheese are among the many notes in the complex nose, along with a delicate sweet peat and wood polish. The taste starts sweet but quickly gets overwhelmed by Tellicherry peppercorns. There’s a hint of dark chocolate and cream, followed by a sweet and minty finish. Water only accentuates the pepper. Like many an old whisky, the nose is more intriguing than the taste, and ultimately the pepper is out of balance with the rest of the flavors. But that’s the fun of single casks and small batch blends - you’d never find a nose like this on an official release."
