4.0,"Really nice. Sweet brown sugar and cherries with a hint of WT funk I love so much. Make whiskey like this again, please."
4.5,"vanilla, oak and leather on the nose. Strong leather and oak leads to a super smooth vanilla with a spicy oaky finish. Adding a bit of water transforms this whiskey into a spice bomb with a buttery vanilla finish"
3.75,"Nose is mild. Fruity and minty on the nose. Some cream, burnt sugar, and then a weird unexplainable note. Nose gets better with time, with vanilla increasing. It says white chocolate on the bottle, and I don't know if it's the power of suggestion, but I get it. On the palate, a bit thin, but flavors cascade. Layered. Long minty finish. The nose is the best part of this. 11/2/18"

5.0,Got one. Waiting to open...
5.0,"Classic 1980-1990s WT Funk. Much better than 1998 vintage, the alcoholic strength helps a lot here (but surprisingly smooth). Luv it."

4.75,"Nose- Heavy charred oak, honeyed bread, sweet caramel, banana, rosemary, dill, baking spices

Palate- dry oak, dill, rye spices, cocoa powder, caramelized sugar, apples, vanilla

Finish- Long, oily finish with notes of Toasted oak, baking spices, and sweet fruits 


Big, bold, and beautiful. Fantastic bourbon. The nose is complex and gets better with time, with a perfect balance of sweet, spice, and oak. The palate is very similar to the nose, perfectly balanced. The sweetness and rye spices compliment eachother well, and getting a lovely apple note as well. The finish is, as expected, extremely long and enjoyable."

4.5,"Neat. Neck pour.  Nose is somewhat brighter than I expected for 16 year WT product.  Caramels, bright cherries and some WT nuttiness are the first notes to leap out at me.  The fruits on this are surprising intense.  Raspberries, cherries 
and strawberries. A nice vanilla wraps all the fruit together with a nice sweetness.  

Sitting with it for 20 minutes, the dark notes start coming through.  A tremendous amount of baking spices and burnt caramels.  Only a hint of oak which is very surprising.

Very nice, creamy texture.  All that vanilla, red fruits, and cinnamon dominate the tongue.  The flavors are surprisingly muted for the initial swallow and then upper cut you with caramel and oak.  And more oak.  And more oak.  And more oak.  On subsequent sips, the vanilla sweetness becomes more prevalent but can’t overcome that oak.  

I can’t believe how the oak was mostly a background note on the nose at first and then just punches you relentlessly in the face in the finish.  It’s a fun and interesting experience but I wouldn’t call it delicious.  It’s special but not upper echelon.  I’ll return to it in a few months and see if it opens up to take it to a truly elite level."
4.0,"slightly oaky, but plenty of body with a decent amount of burn & sweet. biggest hindrance... the burn gets in the way of the taste whereas in the booker’s 30th the proof enhances the flavor. overall not bad at all 👍"
4.0,Great pour - slightly too oaky on the finish is the only criticism.  Classic RR profile but elevated
4.5,"The color is a vibrant, rich amber, with a nose that is full of dry oak, leather, cinnamon, clove, campfire smoke, molasses and hints of vanilla and burnt caramel. The palate is dry and full of campfire smoke, dried oak, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, clove, vanilla, and some interesting hints of rye spiciness. The finish is medium long with a mouth full of campfire smoke and dried oak while the spiciness fades and reveals more of the vanilla."
