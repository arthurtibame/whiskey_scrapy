5.0,"Nose - Nose is like if you sauteed a vanilla bean in some quality butter and then added fresh juicy strawberries, plump bing cherries, and a small slice of banana that was poured over some vanilla ice cream and garnished with some lavender.
Taste - Like the nose, you are immediately hit with a sweet buttery fruit, strawberries, juicy cherries, and a light cinnamon burn. There's a hint of oak in there as well, but is subdued considering the age of some of the bourbons in this small batch. It honestly tastes like a high rye bourbon (which these are) that has been mellowed out in some ex berry-wine casks for a short amount of time.
Finish - The light, floral and berry fruit transitions into a slightly dry, oaky, pleasant cinnamon spice where the classic bourbon notes of vanilla, caramel, and toffee finally show up.

5.0,"Well balanced, full body, long finish, this is a true masterpiece."
5.0,"Nose:  The nose enters with a perfect balance of crystal clear rye and oak spices followed by red cherry and dark chocolate.  From the spice the nose turns bounces back and forth between confectionary and fruit sweetness.  Toffee drizzled cinnamon rolls, freshly baked come to mind with a dollop of orange icing.  Crushed nuts, candied apple and some pear.  Christmas spices come to life with banana salt water taffy, maybe some banana bread too, more red cherries and strawberries, sweet brown cereal notes, like honeyed bran breakfast cereal.  Grape juice, sugar cookie and vanilla graham cracker finish things off with a memory of cane sugar crystals and hints of peanut butter.
______________________________________________________________________________________________

Palate: Gorgeous spice bomb from the start, like a nuclear explosion in silent slow motion…but from a distance.  Astounding.  The moment this dram hits your tongue, the black cracked pepper and rye spices erupt.  Fall out clouds of firm menthol and cocoa dust starts to fill your palate halfway through – no dryness however…interesting.  Quick confectionary sugars, more toasted oak from the nose and some sweet cherry shows up.  You can tell this FR expression has some batches with age – sweet woody spices now, cinnamon spice and cinnamon sugar.  Toffee and more pure can sugary goodness, all in check.  Quite exquisite.
______________________________________________________________________________________________

Finish: This is a slow fader and has a long finish, which at cask strength should be expected.  Toffee from the back palate lingers with brown sugars.  The rise of spice is perfectly mirrored in dissipation on the finish, a long fading out and a clear reminder of what you just experienced – like a bell curve.  Black licorice, charred barrel and an older sense of rye is the best way to describe these final notes.  Some menthol, light oak tannins play off this overall toasty finish.

3.0,"The nose on this is delicate and surrounded by a big cloud of alcohol. You've gotta be patient and sift through the ethanol fumes to see what's there, and it isn't much: dry oak, corn syrup, red apple skins, and rye grist. All of it in minuscule amounts.

The palate is more giving. Rich sweetness and amped fruit flavors from the alcohol. The finish rings your tongue for saliva with generous spices and dry tannins.

Adding water doesn't help the nose much but makes for a more luscious mid-palate. The sweetness is more akin to peach juice and honey. The texture becomes more silken before the tannins ride in again at the end.

A sweeter side to Four Roses to be sure. Glad I tried this, but it's not a bottle I'd chase."

4.75,"Nose- Cinnamon, herbal- mint, ripe cherries, wood spice, rye spice

Palate- Wave of green tea initially, wet oak, cherry-cola, cloves, dark honey

Finish- Long, creamy finish with flavors of fresh mint, cherries and bold, wet oak 


Overall, this is very good. The nose is a bit muted, but fresh mint and rye spice stand out. The palate is where this shines, with a unique green tea note and lovely wet, bold oak from start to finish. Enjoyable, long and mouth coating finish that keeps everything lovely and balanced."

3.5,"My second Bourbon. It is waaaaaay better than Jim Beam white label. Now that i got that out of my system, i can tell you, it is a fair dram, nothing too special. A little complex maybe, a solid 3.5 out of 5.

bottled at 45%abv, with a polished Mahogany Color. 

On the Nose you will find citrus fruit notes, like grapes, plums, prunes, and lemon. There is something stinky here i dont know what it is, i read someone said ""glue"", i just dont know what it is. Sometimes it brings back memories from the standard Jack Daniels Old No.7, has the same nose profile, with a little toffee and vanilla if you give it a couple more tries on the nose.

On the palate is a changing dram, starts sweet like caramel, inmediately turns hot and spicy, oak and oranges appear to make a bitter finish, which is medium. It is light-medium bodied, and if you add two drops of water it will became chewable with an only candy note on the palate.

I believe i am not a great bourbon drinker yet, but i am still thinking this are way inferior to scotch single malts, I have also an Elijah Craig Small Batch, a Blanton's single barrel and a Makers mark 46 waiting to be opened; maybe i will have better luck on those. One other thing, i haven't add Coca Cola on this, but it seems it would fit right on it. In the future i'll give it a try."
