4.0,"It is almost unknown. It is cheap. It is good. A ""lightly peated"" blended whisky, it doesn't even have a website. You cam have it for around $25.

Bottled at 43%abv

On the nose, its peaty, so its good. Slight aromatic peat, toffee, earthy and salty. 

On the palate, Very sulphuric. Lots of Toffee too. 

Hay: lots of burning hay. First time i had this. So grassy. Interesting.
Burning oak sensation. 

Aftertaste is very short, peppery. 

Overall this is a solid 80 over 100 specially for the price tag."
