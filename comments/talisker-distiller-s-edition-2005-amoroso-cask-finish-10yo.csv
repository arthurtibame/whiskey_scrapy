5.0,"As soon as you read ""talisker"" in the title of this review, you knew the score. 

Man, this was absolutely amazing. Its like ""Talisker 10 meets Glendronach 18"". I haven't even heard of amoroso wood cask before, it seems to be a type of fortified wine / sherry. 

Amoroso in spanish, my native tongue, means ""a person who loves"". I am very ""amoroso"" with this dram.

Bottled at talisker's classic 45.8%abv, tawny color.

On the nose, it is heaven. Wonderful peat, Sherry, figs, Marmalade blackberry, Mostly earthy; Not as peaty as other talisker, Salty
And Plums.

On the palate is... well, perfect. Glazed pork mixed with a Pepper bomb; Butterscoth, Citric, Gunpowder, Bonfire. Such a strange but wonderful combo. 

Aftertaste is eternal. Super smoky, Salty, Citric and Burnt meat. There are no easy parts here, this is a fight against an ufc fighter, no rest here, from the first second it just explodes in your palate. 

My score for it? 99 over 100. Amazing. Slainte. Go buy it now."
