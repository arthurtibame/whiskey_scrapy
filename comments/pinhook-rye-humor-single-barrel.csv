2.5,"For today's Whiskey of the day we have an interesting single barrel release from Pinhook. Pinhook are based out of Kentucky, however, they source all of their rye from MGP using the 95% rye mashbill. It's a young rye age stated at 3 years old and bottled at cask strength (115.3 proof for this barrel). This particular barrel was picked by a local distributor and is available at multiple stores for $69.99 (I bought it at Liquor Express). 

This was one that pretty much everyone I sample swap with wanted a sample so as a result my bottle is almost gone! Let's dive into the tasting notes:

Entry is fairly light for a cask strength release and is very classic MGP rye. Cinnamon, vanilla, dill, dark chocolate with a peppery finish. Finish is fairly short and a bit sharp. So here is my rub with this one, for the price point I personally would not re buy it. It's tasty if you like MGP rye profile, but not worth the $69.99. I personally preferred the cask strength bourbon release they did more than this and that was $20 less. Cheers All!"
