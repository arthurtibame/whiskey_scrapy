2.0,Front end is good but the finish is a bit rough. Detroit City rye is much better.

1.0,I admit I bought it for the cool label! Very young. A bandwagon attempt.
2.0,"This is a very young bourbon, so it’s fairly Rough and not enjoyable to drink neat or on the rocks. I’ve had it in a cocktail in which bourbon was not the main liquor , and it was ok. I had it in an old-fashioned, which wasn’t pleasant."

1.0,"I wanted to like this--""say nice things about Detroit"" and all--and credit to these guys for (mostly) starting from scratch and making their own spirits the hard way (as opposed to sourcing like so many others). And I totally wish them the best. . . . BUT this is not good. It is less than not good.  Their own spirit just absolutely erases the straight bourbon component. Corny, raw, dank, leather, and unbalanced oak (the flavour alternates corny alcohol bite with soggy charred wood). It's palatable in a cocktail (and the distillery bar itself is a nice, if somewhat pricy, place for a drink in Detroit) but not worth your time as things currently stand."
