3.0,First bourbon for the week. Asked the front desk if I could use my $5 voucher for something tonight. Card specified no alcohol. She ‘upgraded’ with a 2 drink card. Very nice!

4.25,Vanilla and caramel nose. Slight apple. Medium finish with little spice. Very good rye.
1.25,First notes are grass clippings. This is a gross rye for the price. Kinda like a Sazerac 6 year but worse.

4.25,"Nose has a wonderful combo of green apple and thyme.  Vanilla.  Light strawberry like sweetness.

Taste has green apple, vanilla, and oak.  Slight tannic character.  Faint citrus - like a sweet lemon or lime.  Clove and nutmeg punch in, too."
4.25,"Exceptionally smooth, however the mouth feel isn't quite what I hoped.  It's thinner than expected.  Otherwise a great one to sip on with a nice cigar."
5.0,Super smooth

3.5,"Lime citrus, oak and molasses on the nose. Sweet and spicy (molasses and black pepper) on the taste and an oily finish with citrusy dry crispness left in the mouth."

3.75,Clean rye and oak taste. Really that is exactly what you get. Not many subtleties to this one. It is very oily with a clean lingering rye and oak finish. Price is based on age I assume. I much prefer the finished 12 with a little oxidation time.
