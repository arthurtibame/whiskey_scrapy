3.0,This is a spivey and aggressive rye for 100 proof. On the nose you get the expected rye experience with sweet mint. The palate gets an initial burst of sugar that immediately turns hot with cinnamon and peppery notes dominating. I think this one and the operation as a whole shows a lot of promise. More age will defiantly help and I see a lot of good things to come from this brewstillery.

4.25,"Notes of apricot, walnut, and pepper. Probably better with a single ice cube instead of neat, to bring out the flavor and ever so slightly mellow the 100 proof product."

2.75,"If you wait long enough there’s a long dill finish, very much like I just stuck a dill branch in my mouth. Not necessarily a bad thing. I like dill. But, everything before that is rather unpleasant- mostly just ethanol burn."
