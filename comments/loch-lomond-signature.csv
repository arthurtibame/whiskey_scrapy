4.0,"By their own admission, this blend (of only their own product) aims for the same general flavor profile as Johnnie Walker Black and...well, it definitely manages that, albeit with a slightly off-putting nose. There's a bit of something funky on the nose, with new shoes, earth, and (thankfully) some vanilla. The palate, though, is quite nice - toffee, vanilla, dried fruit, nuts, and a hint of smoke. Rich, round, and long-lasting. It's  priced well, too."
2.5,"This is a blended whisky from loch lomond, that used the solera system to get consistency between bottles.

Bottled at 40%abv, amber color.

On the nose, Acetone, Cake crest, Vanilla cookies, Lemon peel, Tobbaco leaf very dim. Apple - cinammon after some sips.

On the palate it is a little straightforward, apple, pepper and oak, burning sensation. 
Aftertaste is cinnamon and some oak.

Adding drops of water actually makes it a little better. Enhances the apple flavors and the vanilla aroma. Makes it easier to drink. 

Overall i rate this dram with a 59 over 100."

3.75,"Love the smoky and fainted peaty notes that you smell on the nose and also lingers in your month. Very lightweight smoky and peaty notes compare to others just enough to tease you it's there.
I say this is sort of excellent example in terms of reasonable price and entry level to this domain without breaking the bank and still enjoyable not in your face."
3.25,"Smoky, peady, light fruit taste."
3.5,this would be a great introduction to peated whiskeys.  pleasant & lightly peated.
