5.0,"Oh my god, the nose is amazing!!   I was saving my last bit from the bottle, and finally decided to have it today.   I loved it the first time, loving it even more now.   It's actually interesting to first try a whiskey early on before you try many other good ones, and then come back to it years later and see if it's just as good second time around.  This one is.  Nose is oranges and chocolate.  And not much else.  If you don't like oranges or chocolate, you won't like this.  Taste is clean, silky smooth.  Dates and fig.  Honey and chocolate.  Damn this is good.  Almost up there with the Yamazaki 18 and Macallan Fine Oak.   Finish is warming, mocha and mint.  Like ordering a Starbucks mochachino and then having a thin mint.  I got this bottle years ago on a vacation to Sydney, Cairns and Ayers Rock.  Finished most of it during my two weeks there.  Saved a small amount to bring back in a vial to prevent oxidation.  Bought back memories of hiking around Ayers, diving n the Great Barrier, and drinks at the Rocks area of Sydney.  If you appreciate well made whiskey, this has to be on your  must ave list."
