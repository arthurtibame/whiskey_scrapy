4.25,"I’ll come back to this but for now...first! This is really in my wheelhouse. Port finish on some excellent peaty malt? Not sure what the source is but it works. Seems to combine a few different peat sources as it’s not very salty but not orkney sweet either. Definitely some Campbelltown funk in there. bottled at a robust abv and NCF with no color added. I’m in love. 

If anyone has tasted this and/or knows the source Please share by comment. I’ve hunted online and not a lot there about the bottler nor this specific whisky. I’m guessing by the label that this is one malt from one distiller with a teaspoon of something else but I can’t place it. Speculation welcome!

Update: seems to be teaspoon ledaig in port barrels. Mystery solved. Still enjoying it. Especially the abv. 

Update#2: just opened the ledaig 10 and this is definitely it. I like the ledaig 10 too but still rate the peatside a bit higher as the port really gives this an interesting finish in comparison to the 10. However the 10 can be had at a much more reasonable price."
