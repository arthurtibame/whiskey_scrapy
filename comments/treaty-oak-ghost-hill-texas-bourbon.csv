3.25,"Decently mellow. lots of spice: cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla. cherries and oak. Tastes like it smells. 

It'd be better if it were older or cheaper."

Taste: Very much how it smells with the oak being the most prominent flavor - I enjoyed it in a cocktail but really turned off when neat"

3.0,"I’m officiating my cousin’s wedding this weekend here in Dripping Springs, so when the opportunity arose to sample a very local, grain-to-glass bourbon...I’m not saying no to that.

The first thing that is obvious on the nose is the age, or lack thereof, of the spirit. That hard to describe, but recognizable scent mildly reminiscent of shoe polish is all over this dram. It’s not unpleasant per se, but it screams that the bourbon needs more time to mature into its true self. There’s a pronounced cinnamon and nutmeg spice beyond that, cherry cola, and vanilla custard.

The palate matches the nose - very young, but at least fairly smooth with minimal burn. The flavors are spice-forward, Red Hot candies and crema Catalana dusted with nutmeg washed down with a sip of cherry cola.

Overall, this is a promising start. I think the base spirit is high quality stuff, but it needs more time in the barrel to live into its potential. With some more time and care to develop those flavors and build up some more complex layers, this could become a truly excellent bourbon. As is, it’s a perfectly fine, if a bit unexciting, drink for a rehearsal dinner."
3.0,"Perfectly serviceable whiskey. Lacks the boldness and flavor of other top Texas distilleries. Would be a fine mixer, though personally I would like to see it $10 cheaper if I were going to use it for that purpose"
3.5,"Nose is medium and smells like raw nuts, corn, cherry, and baking spice. There is limited burn, but still some tingling on the palate with an immediate presence of cinnamon, as in Red Hots Cinnamon candy. The mouthfeel is only lightly creamy and seems quite young. After drinking and resting the flavors fade from the palate and I taste hints of fruit juice."
3.75,"Fruity nose, sweetness maybe some oak and hint of vanilla. Bread, salty, and slight oak on the taste with an oily finish."

2.0,Is a low corn bourbon and I think that is throwing me. There is grain dust smell that I want to attribute to its youth but I feel that is only part of it. I think the high wheat content is throwing me as well. Interesting but not sure I am a fan.

3.5,"Solid bourbon. Unique characteristics, lots of corn undertones. Sweet, oaky, young tasting, maybe one more year in barrel would have matured it. A lot of potential."
3.25,Nothing too exciting here. I do enjoy that is is all locally sourced grains but might need to up the proof a bit for my taste.

3.25,"Treaty Oak Distilling 
Ghost Hill Texas Bourbon Single Barrel 47.5% abv
57% Texas Corn, 32% Texas Wheat, 11% American Barley

Nose: dense vanilla, corn, sweet bread, tea leaves, strawberry poundcake, bright cherry, vanilla frosting, signature Texas Oak earthy and funky, cinnamon pecan twirl, 
Palate: smoooooth and sweet on entry, slightly oily and creamy, tea and honey with some fruity character then an explosion of barrel and proof spiciness. Drinks a little hotter than the 95 proof mark and that’s not a bad thing. Vanilla extract, caramel & brown sugar, berries, cinnamon. The mid palate is brief before the peppery barrel notes envelope your mouth from back to front and you get a nice dose of oak. 
Finish: vanilla cream, leather, sour oak, and a hint of mint cream swirls around. 

- [ ] It’s classic Texas... and it’s not. That funky Texas Oak is there but it’s not dominant. It adds just the right amount of oak to keep this interesting. The mid palate is really brief and there’s not a lot of complexity. It’s simple and forward. Oak dominates the back half and it gets a little sour on the finish. Puts me in the mind of Larceny Bourbon went for a horseback ride through Texas and came out like you would expect... dusty, sunburnt, and with a little attitude 😉."
