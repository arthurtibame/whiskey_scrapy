1.0,"My first white whiskey. It's really interesting to taste unaged rye. It's light and crisp. It obviously lacks the caramelization it would gain from aging. The taste isn't all bad. It tastes like what it is, fermented raw grain. It's the high ABV that kills it. It's a more subtle taste profile that's completely overpowered by raw alcohol. Not available in Ontario."
