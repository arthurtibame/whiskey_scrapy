5.0,"A very good Bourbon like Japanese. Notes of caramel, vanilla, and berries. Better than the Hibiki Harmony. Had this in a tasting along the Hibiki Harmony, Hakushu Distiller Reserve, Hakushu 12, Suntory Old, JBA Byron, and the Yoichi Hokkaido Limited Edition."
2.0,"Vanilla, oak, a hint of dark fruit sweetness and light tobacco smoke followed by significant floral spice. Good underlying flavour but unrefined. Not available in Ontario."

1.0,"WhiskeyLive Dublin 2018
This was the worst whiskey of the night at WhiskeyLive.  I am sure at that stage my taste buds were overworked but there was no mistaking the poor taste of this one - I couldn't get past a sour metallic smell and taste. I followed it up with Mars Komagatake Nature of Shinshu Shinamotanpopo which was very decent (3.5) and so much better than this."

3.5,"This one is hard to explain. Sharp with a lot going on. There's sweets, there's spices, bitter and salt. Tobacco and caramel. 

Nose: Dark fruit and hints of wet earth and wood. After a while it becomes sweeter and more smooth. 

Palate: Sharp spices, wood tones together with liquerish. Bitter and also sweet on the tongue.

Finish: Quite a long spicey finish, lots of wood going on and pure chocolate somewhere. A bitter ending."

3.5,"Nose is strong honey, floral covering sweet blueberry

Initial flavors of honey give way to clove and some other rich but subtle spice

Crisp but not hot

Finish is floral, leaves the mouth feeling quite dry"
