5.0,"Hot damn this is GOOD. Have you ever had a whisky so delicious you just kept staring at your dram with both bewilderment and admiration? Well THAT. JUST. HAPPENED! The nose is incredibly complex, with a touch of smoke, some toffee, caramel, and heaven. The palate has notes of subtle cinnamon , cane sugar and wood (not sure which casks were used here). The finish is quite long and balanced, with sweet sugar lingering for minutes on end. Definitely worth its hard find. Enjoy!"

4.0,This is very good! Just the right mix between a smooth Taketsuru and Nikka Coffey grain. The malts start smooth and then the sweetness from the grain rushes in and takes over before giving way to an incredibly long spicy finish. This is a fun whisky!

5.0,8/17 From Japan by Jason. Sweet backbone (similar to Coffey Grain) with a hint of peat in a perfect balance.

5.0,Very little and quintessential Japanese whisky. Lots of floral tones and a nice medium finish. The green apple nose and body give it a refreshing taste.

4.0,"Nose - Baked green apples, light fruity tropical vanilla, lightly spiced floral honey.

Taste - Toasted green apples, dark floral honey, light woody/smoky spice, golden raisins rehydrated in a lightly oaked white wine, tastes ""dark"" at the same time being light & fruity.

Finish - Lightly fruity bitterness lingers like an oaked white wine, mild white pepper heat, dark golden raisins, dried apple rings.

Score - 82/100

Final Thoughts - This was a very interesting Japanese blend in that it tasted both ""dark"" & ""light"" at the same time if that makes any sense. I got this dark oaky profile at the same time as fresh green apples. Almost like dried apple rings that haven't been treated so they look a bit darker in color, but still retain their light fruity profile? Regardless it's a very gentle blend, nothing off putting and very light. Well balanced if not a bit boring other than the dark, yet light fruity/floral balance. This one might fair pretty well in a highball, but with maybe a bit less soda water to let this lighter whisky play a larger role."

4.0,Sweet spicy butterscotch and butterscotch I like. It’s also smooth and a worth replacement to the taketsuru 12 if not better. Love the bottle and had this tasted at the Miyagikyo distillery 25/8

5.0,Damn good whisky. Nikka does not disappoint. I'm hesitant to finish my bottle because this isn't easy to find. Buy it if you can find it.
