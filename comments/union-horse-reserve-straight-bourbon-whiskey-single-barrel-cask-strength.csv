4.5,"Nose: a dark sweetness like molasses, cloves, tobacco, rye 
Taste: brown sugar and cola but that being said not overly sweet, rye - dill more than anise but not a huge tilt in that direction, maybe a bit of orange
Finish: dry, there’s a freshness to it that’s not a minty taste but that feeling on your tongue, rye
After reading reviews: I didn’t get the cherry and vanilla mentioned in a lot of reviews for the standard release, but the consistent rye notes make sense now knowing it’s 20% rye with no barley, the brown sugar I got easily could be the caramel others reference and my molasses could be others’ honey, reassuring to see a menthol mention to know I’m not crazy or at least the only one"
