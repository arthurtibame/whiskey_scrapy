3.0,A little too light and subtle for me.
4.0,"The most interesting thing about Corner Creek, to my tastebuds, is the way it reminds me of sucking on a pebble or a stone. That might not sound appetizing, but I actually rather enjoy it. I hear there's a lot of batch-to-batch variance, but my experience has always been that the price is right ($35 Cdn.) and the bourbon is pretty decent: full of earthy flavours, with hints of green apple and white wine (maybe that's the wine bottle-style packaging talking). Vanilla, cherries, raspberries. Asphalt. Musty rye, pickles and soap (though not in a bad way). Nutty (I wouldn't be surprised if there was some Beam in the blend). Sweet and dry. It's an interesting, unique bourbon."

1.0,For me this tastes more like a rye whiskey than a bourbon. I was not a fan. I was thinking it would be a young less flavorful Noah's Mill or Rowan's Creek but it was nothing like them. Maybe it's my palet but I regret the purchase.
1.0,"Much like the wine bottle it comes in it is tolerable once it has breathed for a while.  Tolerable is the best description I could come up with to describe this bourbon.  Lacks the body of a quality bourbon...ironically my wife (a non-drinker) said ""this doesn't smell like what you normally drink"". Frankly it didn't taste like it either.  Maybe the filtration process turns it into Tennessee whiskey.  Maybe it just makes for a tolerable bourbon. This will not be purchased again by me, if your a fan of jack might give this one a try."

3.0,"Fairly light body. Almost airy on the palate. Smells of banana essence. Smooth on the rocks, spicy when drank neat."
3.0,For me light equates to thin and by that I mean it has no body to it. I might buy it again if I could find it at $20 but here in Michigan it is $26. There are many better options at that price.

4.0,"Kory and Ashlyn surprised me with this for my grad school acceptance. (Tears, crying, warmth.) On the nose I find butterscotch, nutmeg, vanilla, light mint, and barrel spices. On the palate there's melted butter, vanilla buttercream frosting, red velvet cake, and fresh herbs such as tarragon, basil, and crushed mint. The finish is wispy, light, and pleasant, while the aftertaste is of maple and spices. This is my first bottle of bourbon, and I couldn't imagine a better one to have on the shelf. This whiskey is light and straightforward, but it's sure of itself. Four stars for value and craft that speaks for itself."

4.0,"I'll start with this. I've lived on this earth my entire life. That's roughly 42 years and the earth doesn't smell like this bourbon. I confirmed this prior to writing this review by stepping outside....I didn't smell bourbon. This is the last I will say about the earth. It's a nice place to live but it's not living in my glass right now. 
I've never understood leather comments. Maybe I'll ask my son in about 19 years. He seems to like trying to eat our couch so if he can remember what that tastes like in a couple decades I will update this review. For now I am going to choose not to gnaw on my belt and also leave leather out of my reviews. 
I will say this. Corner Creek is pretty darn good for the price. It's got a nice way of coating your mouth in an almost creamy way. I would make a joke about this but I would probably get kicked off the app by some SJW for invading someone's Safe Space. Sweet is another main flavor. I can buy into saying vanilla. Mostly cause it tastes like vanilla a little bit not cause I read that you should write vanilla if your are posting bourbon reviews. 
No charcoal here. Then again how would I know. I've never shoved my face into a nice bag of hardwood prior to firing up the Weber. 
Buy this bourbon. If this app had 3.5 stars I would give it that rank. For 25 bucks it's worth buying. Maybe you will taste something fun like cotton?"

The nose has really wonderful notes of walnuts, vanilla, and caramel, with a nutty palate that has a pleasant dose of charred oak.

From the information i managed to get on the internet this is a sourced bourbon from the people behind Willet. Wouldnt pay more than $30 for this bottle, i rather have IW Harper for a few more dollars. Its a good sub $25 bourbon for sure and i would pick this over any entry level bourbon for sure."

2.75,"My friend found a bottle of this on a discount rack as its been de-listed in NC.  I was not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised.  It had flavor, spice, and dimension, but not a great amount of depth.  Not much oak or vanilla to speak of but no offputting flavors.  Nice cinnamon notes which must indicate a higher rye mash bill.   All the good news about this unavailable spirit fails to overcome the fact that I can get much better bottles for ~$30.  While I appreciate the different flavors for an affordable price, Corner Creek suffers from the overloaded bourbon offerings in its price range that are far superior."

4.0,"Burnt barrel to the nose, with some smoke. The tons of heavy fresh oak, oh. Some aged wine. And some chocolate to the core, what later raises into buckwheat honey and carnation.
Reminds of dense forests and rivers really.
Lovely color. Deep chestnut and amber.
All the same to the tongue with a slight, very pleasant sweetness (vanilla and caramel, some coconut on palate), juicy pear. Very warm. Burns your tongue a bit. 
Finish is amazing. Not that long, not that short. Smoky and oaky.
As a result - brilliantly balanced and complex bourbon but a bit heavy due to all the components of the taste are heavy.
Seems to come great with a cigar."
