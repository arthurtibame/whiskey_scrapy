3.5,"Recently i reviewed the Whyte & Mackay NAS blended scotch, and it was surprising because it was the cheapest expression. This time i review the 13yo one, which should be better, but it isn't.

Bottled at 40%abv

On the nose, pepper, vanilla, a dim, very dim sherry/grape note. Not too fragant and quite simple.

On the palate, there is this strong grain whisky presence, and that is not a very delightful thing here. Some caramel, oak and herbal notes. Finish is regular with hints of dry chocolate cake.

Overall this is a very simple dram. 76 over a 100 for this, and i am generous in this score."

1.0,Disappointing. For an aged whisky it lacks depth and finish.
