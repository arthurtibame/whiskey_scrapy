4.0,"A nice blend that starts and finishes well like a good balanced Japanese whisky as you would expect . It’s not quite a hibiki which has a much more finished approach but this is not bad for aud 99.99. Wouldn’t pay the crazy typical price for this. Sadly of course this is discontinued like many so grab if you can at the 99.99 price as it would easily stand up over a Nikka from the barrel and maybe just below the hibiki harmony which are both priced over this. 

This is spicy, a little bit understated upfront but finishes better and has all the right balanced hallmarks of a Japanese whisky. Semi sweet and a tad salty and creamy.

Looking forward to trying the signature blend 

Extra half star for the price"

3.0,"Non-Chill filtered, and good with a little dilution. Tastes light like a Japanese whiskey, but is rich enough to be enjoyable. Excellent for the money."

4.0,"Very nice and strong one.

I can smell maple, Chestnut cream, caramel, vanilla.

Medium finish and strong. 50abv"
4.0,Sweet like a sherry cask whiskey. Doesn’t taste as strong as it is supposed to be.
4.0,"I got to say i have never heard of this one before. After some research, this one is a $55 whisky, a blended one (grain and malt) made by Fuji Gotemba. 

Bottled at 50%abv

A tasty little fellow this one.

On the nose: Red apple, Lemon, Grain whisky aroma (cereal), Almonds, Banana cake.

On the palate, its rather tasty. Cherry at the beggining, then a Wasabi Spice bomb. A lot of cream from the grain whisky. A Rye spiciness. Finish is very long and spicy. 

For $55, this is a good blend. The bottle is nice and it is an interesting dram. Its not going to change anyone's life but it is a good offer. Overall i give it an 83 over 100."
