4.0,"Thanks to @Dreaming-of-Islay, a long overdue review.  Had this sample sent some time ago, and finally getting around to it 

One part of me feels as if having a pour of whiskey is indulgent, considering the world around us crumbling.  And especially knowing that it’ll get worse before it gets better—-even after the virus is done, we’ll have to contend with massive unemployment, and skyrocketing national debt.  And unlike South Korea, Taiwan and Japan, where their leadership acted quickly, our leadership ignored intelligence hearings, writing it off as a hoax—-so, unlike them, we’ll see some damage. 

Another part of me looks forward to a bit of solace, in a simple 3-5cl pour of a nice dram, once a week, after a harsh week of leading CV19 corporate front lines.  

This one is unique—it is Japanese, but it’s made from rice.  Not corn, wheat or barley.  It makes a lighter pour, which can be used as a drawing board for really good finishes and aging.  Light on the nose, more like a middle age Balvenie, with a palette balancing nicely between wood influence and distillate.  

It’s unique—and a nice departure from the standard grain.  

Thanks @Dreaming-of-Islay for the pour!"

4.0,"Beautiful, Rich with a sweetness upfront. Copper in color. The aftertaste has a banana, coconut finish, which sounds odd but is actually very tasty. Not for every day drinking but a very nice change if you like a unique Japanese whiskey that is extremely smooth"

4.0,"Picked this up at Flask Fine Wines & Whisky in Studio City. Cask #284. Very fruity, and a bit heftier than I was expecting. There's a buttery quality to it that sort of offsets the sweetness of the fruit and keeps it well balanced. It's like liquid fruit cake. A bit light on the back of the tongue, and probably would've liked more wood notes to round it out, but all in all a pretty enjoyable dram!"
