4.0,"Nose: vanilla, cherry, caramelized red apple.

Taste: nutmeg, spice, raisins, soft leather, wax. 

Experience: walking into you grandparents house. Grandma's  Flowers, perfume, unknown spices, wax fruits. But also grandpa's leather boots, dusty shirt, and favorite spirit."

2.0,"A hint of mushroom on the nose. Smells like cream of mushroom soup. I dare you not to smell cream of mushrooms soup. Campbell's, in fact. Don't worry, that doesn't carry over on the palate. It's sharp, with wood tannins and spice. Some earthy notes, cough syrup, bitterness at the end. Not much of a hug going down. Not offensive. 3/8/18"
3.0,"Nose: Smooth vanilla and oak come through. Subtle nutty notes. Sour apple as well after a few nosings. 

Mouthfeel: medium, a bit oily. I really like this

Palate: vanilla, milk chocolate. Pretty sweet

Finish: medium length finish. 

Overall: pretty decent for the price. I still have yet to find something that can beat OGD 114 in the sub $50 category. You’d be better off getting the 1792 SiB for a few more bucks"

3.0,"I have been on a bit of a 1792 tasting tear of late and had this one and the Port Cask left to complete the tasting flight! One of the local liquor stores I hit on occasion has just opened a new bar across the parking lot and I was told they had a fantastic Bourbon selection. They weren't kidding! This place has probably the finest selection of Bourbon on the West Coast (full verticals of Birthday Bourbon, BTAC, Pappy and vintage squat Weller's to name a few). I was told the pricing was good as well, however, that was less true! It wasnt all bad news as they had the full 1792 line including this one for $8 pour or the Port Cask for $14 pour. So I passed on the Port and tasted this one! 
On the pallette it's typical 1792 just amped up. Rich brown sugar, vanilla and a hint of spice. Mid pallette is more of the same with the finish being meduim with oak and a nice butterscotch note. Mouthfeel is pretty oily. It's a solid pour to be sure. For the $50 I have had the chance to buy this one, I am glad I passed. For an $8 pour, it's a solid deal. Like the other 1792 limited releases, this is a winner if a little overpriced and hyped (#10 on the 2018 WA list). Here is how I have the 1792 I have tasted thus far ranked:
1) Full Proof
2) High Rye
3) tie Sweet Wheat
3) tie BIB
4) Small batch (by some margin)
Cheers all!"

3.25,"Reviewing the 2019 Batch.
I had a chance to get a pour of the 2018 batch last year and was fairly impressed with it. It didn't blow me away, per se, however, it left enough of an impression for me to keep an eye out if I saw one at SRP ($36).
For background, this is a limited release from Barton Distillery as part of their 1792 line. It's distilled from a high rye mashbill (undisclosed) and conforms to all Bottle in Bond standards (100 proof, distilled from a single Distillery in a single season, at least 4 yrs old and aged in a federally bonded warehouse). It's an NAS Bourbon that the Distillery states is ""well aged"". It's estimated to be a blend of 8-10 yr old stock. One batch is released annually each fall, so it's allocated and does require some hunting to get at SRP. On to the tasting!
Upon entry you get hit with caramel and a pronounced banana bread note. Mid pallette features vanilla, allspice and cinnamon intermingled with a toasted oak undertone. Finish is shortish and again spice and toasted oak. Slight hug and pleasant. 
All in all it's quite a nice pour. However, it's not really punching much above it's weight. It's priced well and a good value at sub $40.
Now this was placed at #9 in the 2018 WA top 20 and I can honestly say I don't think it warrants that even factoring in the low cost. It's also picked up a number of accolades and gold medals. 
In summation, is it worth a buy? Yes at $40 or less.
Is it worth actively seeking out? No
Is it the best of the 1792 Limited Releases? No, that still belongs to the Full Proof (especially the store picks).
Cheers all and TGIF!"

4.0,Solid BIB.  My favorite of the 1792s so far.  Best description would be comparable to the EH Taylor small batch BIB.  Comparably Smooth with maybe a slight fruit note of some sort? Peach?  Worth picking up if you can find a bottle.  Would put ahead of the single barrel release.

3.25,"Not my favorite of the 1792 line ( the full proof is) however it’s not bad!
The nose has banana notes and acetone with slight oak, the acetone is off putting but is present....however when sipped the flavor has oak, lot of bananas (to be expected from Barton) slight oak.
The finish is smooth and gentle 
Overall I’d give this probably a 80-83 overall 
Will buy if on sale and enjoy but won’t seek out"

null,"Nose: Everything points towards banana bread mash; vanilla extract, sugar, overripe banana, ground cinnamon, almond flour, and egg. Hints of sour green apple slices and apple blossom start coming out after you get acclimated to the banana notes. This throws you a curve ball compared to your traditional bourbon notes.

Palate: The banana bread mash flavors transfer to the palate predictably. This lays out under your tongue and in the back of your throat. Sour green apple leads the charge and stays pretty sharp. 

Finish: Again, that banana and cinnamon with a sharp green apple hangs in the back end of your mouth. There is definitely a alcohol swell that rises up from your chest. You notice the proof for sure. This feels a tad young and aggressive, but a damn fine dram.

Honestly, for the money, I would go 1792 Full Proof all day. For the extra like 5-10 dollars, the Full Proof delivers more complexities and is very nuanced. 

*Bourbon Street Wine and Spirits Barrel Selection #1"
2.0,"Wanted to try this private single barrel bottled in bond version from Sprayberry bottle shop the night after I tried the single barrel version.  I don't think this is as good of a barrel as the one I had last night.  Much more of an oak smell than the vanilla I got last night.   More alcohol smell and taste.  I don't think it's due to the proof that is only 1.4 higher.   It tastes less aged than the regular.  Neat it had an almost bitter aftertaste.   That went away with ice.   Still not much body, complex flavors or finish. This felt like a cheaper mixer bourbon."
3.5,"Nose: cherry, oak and berries, caramel, later almost a floral and honey

Body: smooth and light (thin)

Palate: light caramel and spice, light vanilla and honey, this is just light. 

Finish: takes a second to kick in then it’s mild and long’ish with late rye bread. Before the rye is a little light cherry and with the rye is a vanilla cream (nice!)

Note: this is nice and sweet and good. I like it but it doesn’t set my hair on fire. I really like the late rye bread!"

4.0,"The last of my 1792 limited run to try, just a tad stronger than the single barrel, the BiB so far seems like a more ""interesting"" addition.   As I found the bottle at a pretty reasonable price, decided to include it in the run. 

Extremely oily beads form on the glass, the characteristic old Barton wood notes waft off the top, and yes the ripe banana, more distinct here than in the other Barton offerings.  Some sour apple, acetate and vanilla sugars also make a showing in the nose. 

On the tongue I like this a lot, probably because the palate offers up some deep sugars and fruit blends that largely out battle the barton barn wood so prevalent in this distillery's product.  While the amber sugar is perceptible, it gets  overshadowed by the fructose and again hints of the barn wood.  Lot's of warmth and sweet heat finish with just a touch of the rye spice 1792 is known for, the well aged aspect is clear in the overall smooth finish and lack of any green bitters.  I can understand why this may well be too sweet for some palates and tastes as it just seems to be less cut of the 1792 high proof offerings. 

Not going to lie I like this one better than the single barrel and about as well as the high rye,  considering how much bourbon got lost in the great rick house collapse of '18,  we might be lucky to see these bottles making a repeat appearance. 

In the 40 dollar range I would call this one a winner."

Fruity nose of banana, rye bread, spun sugar, buttered corn, and caramel green apple. Nose carries over into the taste but with some added butterscotch and cake frosting. Bright and brassy. Medium length finish is cinnamon and white pepper with noticeable Kentucky Hug. Finishes just a little hotter than it should for the proof so just misses a 4.0 for me.

This is the second 1792 product I have purchased. Neither have been “traditional” bourbon flavors, but there is something weirdly appealing in them that I enjoy and look forward to trying others in the line when in the mood for something different."

Might do better with a little more time in the glass or with a drop of water to cut the flames down a bit."

4.5,First off this is a galenstein store pick and this pick was amazing. Based on the other reviews I think the pick must have been a honey barrel. The nose on it touches your brain. A little banana a little vanilla just enough alcohol so it doesn’t burn when you take a good whiff.  It’s got a great taste. The heat comes on a bit and calms down a bit but the taste just stays with you   It’s full and one of the best bourbons that I have wonderful pick.

1.5,"store pick so take it as it is, but with 1792, 90% of the non small batch I feel IS a store pick. 

Nose  - Sweet 1792 classic, vanilla, cotten candy, fluff, marshmellow, just classic 1792.

Taste - So this is classic all in your face 1792 sweet bomb but there's a bit too much spice and well alcohol there at the end.  Even with water there's some bite. 

The flavor is complex as all gets out here. But yeah there's a failure in the spice/heat note. 

1.5 complex beyond words and I might just ice this to death for a nice drinker. But a lot of off notes."

4.0,"BACKGROUND: This 1792 limited release from the Barton Distillery, which was constructed in 1879 and is owned by Sazerac, was made under the requirements of the Bottiled-in-Bond Act of 1897, which means it is 100 proof, was made by one producer during one distilling season, and has been aged at least four years.

First available in 2017, the 1792 BiB was ranked ninth in Whisky Advocate Magazine’s list of “Top 20 Whiskies of 2018.”  This version of the 1792 BiB is a store pick by The Bottle Shop in Columbus, Georgia and cost $35.99.

The 1792 is also available in other editions that include High Rye, Sweet Wheat, Single Barrel and Full Proof. 

Barton also produces bourbon for the the Very Old Barton, Kentucky Tavern, Chestnut Farms and Tom Moore brands, and contract distills for at least a handful of non-distilling producers.

NOSE:  The three predominant scents in the nose of the 1792 Bottled-in-Bond are bananas, bananas, and bananas.  It is a nose that you would expect from Old Forester or other Brown-Forman products.  When combined with the ethanol presence and some brown sugar lingering in the background, the nose smells exactly like a Bananas Foster flambe’.

PALATE: The banana that exists on the nose is also present on the front of the palate along with some nice oak taste that appears on the back.  Rich caramel flavor and, perhaps, some nuttiness reminiscent of a Jim Beam product appear, as well. It is a pleasant and balanced palate.

FINISH: Muted pepper and rye appear on the finish, but there is no big spice bomb that goes off.  It is a long finish that offers just the right amount of warmth, almost like finding the sweet spot when standing near a fireplace.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: The 1792 BiB is neither too spicy, nor too boring.  Instead, it’s just right.  From palate to finish it offers just the right balance in both flavor and sensation.  No matter the brand, I have never gone wrong with a bottled-in-bond bourbon, and the 1792 keeps that streak alive."

On the nose I get heavy baking spices along with rye, green bananas, and vanilla.

The palate is light and creamy. Semi-sweet with baking spices, light leather and vanilla. 

The finish is on the longer side with lingering spices.

The single barrel I have is pretty similar to this Bottled In Bond, with the BiB having a little more depth and slightly richer flavors.
I need to come back to this because I’m not getting the normal 1792 dusty rye thing with either of these, I normally get. I did just have some really spicy Pad Thai, so that might be part of it."
