3.5,"This is straight ""firewater""... the only taste is corn mash and that of a high octane jet fuel. If you're looking to shoot the moon, this is your poison. At 100 proof it's a different bite than that of a Wild Turkey 101... this sneaks up on you but literally leaves you in beastmode for hours on end. I recommend mixing it with a cranberry juice or a ginger ale for ultimate enjoyment. Either way yer gonna get lit! 🥃Cheers!"
0.25,"If I could take the smell that a Diesel engine makes, combine it with burnt rubber, and then have someone next to you fart all while sniffing rubbing alcohol, this would be it. I did make it better by infusing it with blue berries and strawberries for a couple weeks."
3.75,Harsh on the nose. Gives way to strong alcohol and deep lingering burn. I would say it’s an acquired taste. But once you have it... that’s solid.
