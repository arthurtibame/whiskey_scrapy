5.0,One of my favorites. The only reason it gets four stars is because of the price. $45-50. Should be about $30 for the size.

2.0,The nose is all chemical and slightly similar to mineral spirits.  The palate starts off as all grains and alcohol.  It finishes sweet and a lot of cinnamon.  The finish is slightly similar to Fireball.

2.0,"This tastes like a very mild rye, with maybe malt notes next. Silky, and definitely a pleasant sipper, probably evidence of a good mash from people who know what they're doing. But I'm not going to lie, I wanted to taste each grain distinctly and blatantly. The price gives me pause, but this was worth trying. 4/11/17"

3.0,"Dark in appearance, heavy pine notes and sweetish aftertaste. It's ok, but not worth £50 for 35cl. Elijah Craig 12 is a better drop for 2/3 the price."

3.5,A unique flavor from the NY corn. It finishes like roasted corn with a bit of a sweet charred flavor. Unique but good.
