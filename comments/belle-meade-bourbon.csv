2.0,"The bill on this bourbon is heavy on the rye and it shows. The vanilla is one of the first scents you'll encounter on the nose, but it crispens with some orange in your mouth and finishes in a kick of spices that trail down your throat, leaving heat. There's also a bit of roughness at the end. This is a nice bourbon, but it just didn't wow me."

4.0,"This is a very nice bourbon. Different enough that it is a must have for any collection. On the nose, I get the traditional caramel, vanilla, and oak but then you throw in a clove, orange, and nutmeg combination. Not overpowering, but a great nose. On the palate, this one has a great texture. It is sweet up front due to the orange, clove, and rye spices. Then comes the traditional vanilla and oak for the finish with a touch of cinnamon spice. 91/100."

4.25,"Pour: neat in glen cairn

Nose: (4.0) Oak and honey dominate with a bit of toffee and ethanol.

Palate: (4.5) I hate to use the term but it is incredibly smooooooth.  Almost no bite.  Tastes of traditional caramel and vanilla are out front with hint of pepper.    The fact that it is not complex but very traditional bourbon speaks to me.

Finish: (4.0) Could have been longer on the finish as it offered nice fruit and a creamy nougat like finish.  Dont expect alot of spice but just enough keeps it intetesting to go back for a second glass.

Overall:  At 39.99 this is a certain winner.  It makes me want to sample the Madiera and Cognac finishes BUT hard to step up to the 79.99 price tag.  Enjoy this one for $40 less until the fancy ones come down.  A solid bourbon to my collection"
4.0,"The nose is typical bourbon-vanilla, oak, caramel sweet. It’s best with a little bit of added water, yielding a citrus sweetness, a little anise, and a slight oily mouth feel that leads to a peppery rye finish. The sweetness lingers. This is a very nice whiskey!"

4.0,"Thanks to @GeologyJack for giving a generous pour , I actually was able to do a bit of an experiment with this as well as having it the standard way.  I had half of it with a few drops of water.  Aroma is pretty good...circus caramel corn.  Taste is a bit oaky, which I translated to a pretty decent age (maybe 5-9?).  But has again that caramel corn sweetness.  It’s a great bourbon to share with friends and family—-just don’t go expecting a hard punch of power like Elijah Craig BP, or complexity like a Four Roses LESB.  It’s fairly one dimensional but it does it well.  

Now the fun part.  I was making saffron cheesecake today, and I took some of the base for an experiment with the second half of the pour. I made a bit of saffron liquer ( honey, vanilla, cinnamon, saffron, peppercorn in water ) and mixed it as 3 / 1 ratio bourbon / saffron.  Wow.  Talk about complexity!  I got a layer of sweetness from the saffron on top of the bourbon’s inherent sweetness, but a different type from the saffron.  The saffron added almost an herbal sweetness, as opposed to the sugary sweetness from the corn base in bourbon.  And this was then tempered by the cinnamon and peppercorn heat.   I need to replicate that small batch 1 ounce experiment to a larger batch when friends are over."

The finish, like the tasting, is a bit weak, which is a tad disappointing for the age, but the caramel lingers just a millisecond past everything else, leaving you with a decent bourbon."

Like a few other bourbons I have run across, it is different enough from my go-to drinks to make it appealing.  After a bit of analysis, it has a similar flavor profile to the Willett bottles I have tried???  Unfortunately, while available in VA and SC, it is still a no-go in NC.  This would be a STEAL at ~$30-35.  Unfortunately, it is $45 plus the obligatory confiscatory kick to the ""man"".  This makes it a $50 bottle which I think is a bit of a stretch.  However, I plan to keep a bottle around to prevent taste bud attrition."

3.75,"I think Amanda got it right.  Nosing reveals typical sweet scents of vanilla, a bit of Maple, honey, light caramel and wood. Holding it on the tongue it is quite sweet with similar flavors revealed if you can hold it long enough, even the magic coconut. Upon swallow the spice is very nice, typically on the outer edges of the tongue and a slight burn to the throat. At 90.4 proof, this is a toss it down whiskey, if one were of a mind to do so, which I rarely ever do. Just seems a waste of good flavor. But people drink in different ways and for different reasons. I really like easy drinkin' Bourbons like this and will be searching for other Belle Meade whiskeys for sure. Next up the Sherry cask.

 $35.99 in close-by MD. $45 in PA."

3.75,"Smooth, starts out a bit thin but lingers nicely, ok spice - an easy drink 

Vanilla on the nose, scent of charcoal (softer than four roses), fruity flavor disappears into rye, slight campfire marshmallow carmel flavor - not bad, priced ok"

4.0,"Got this on sale for $ 38 been wanting to try for long time. Its aged 6-8 years and is high rye bourbon. Its actually 30% which is higher than most. Here's what Greenbrier says...... “To ensure that no other Bourbon in the world tastes like Belle Meade Bourbon, we created a proprietary blend using two different high-rye content mash bills and two complementary yeast strains from barrels aged between 6 to 8 years. Each batch of our proprietary blend consists of just 4 barrels and creates the signature flavor profile that makes Belle Meade Bourbon the award-winning Bourbon of choice for the discerning whiskey drinker.”   Here's what I say.....Poured neat, nice amber color and good glasscoat. Nose leaps out of glass with spicy caramel, black cherries, old leather, dusty books and wood with brown sugar. Kinda reminds me of a sweeter more vibrant Bulleit. Thick oily mouthfeel brings palate of bold rye, melted butter, spicy oak and rich cherry vanilla. Has a note to it that reminds me of cherry pop rocks or Dr Pepper. Some nice heat but not harsh. Its aggressive but balanced. Finish is lingering polished wood and cinnamon with cola fading to dry heavy oak. Initially I didn't feel it warranted an elite score but after some time enjoying the bottle I quite like it.... its different. This is sourced from mgp but the aging and blending has vastly influenced this bourbon imo. The oily texture and combo of sweet and spicy has won me over .........90/100... yes its a little overpriced but I don't care, its bursting with flavor and has a unique profile. Will need to get some of the special cask finishes now......(have since purchased 3 pack 375ml of all three cask finish versions...reviews to follow)"

Palate: **** classic bourbon taste with hot red hot candy taste, cinnamon, brown sugar, and vanilla oak.
Finish: ***1/2 medium"

4.25,It has a vanilla and caramel smell that is pretty strong.  Thick mouthfeel hits you hard with spicy oak and bold rye.  It’s got some heat so be ready but not too harsh. Finish is lingering oak and cinnamon.  It’s 30% rye so that explains it!

3.75,"Belle Meade has become one of my favorite go to distilleries. This is my first bottle of the sour mash. Nose is sweet like southern candied yams. Taste is full bodied honey and cinnamon forward with a red hot burn that lingers to an almost creamy smooth finish. Not my favorite BM product, but still a nice dram."

4.25,"Belle Meade Bourbon

APPEARANCE: I like the classic looking bottle shape and label. It's fairly light in color and clings like glue to the sides of the Glencairn with fat slow moving legs.
NOSE: Complex. Shapeshifting. Initial impression is Woody, Dry, Spicy, and Floral. Freshly Peeled Orange, Dried Corn, Cedar, Bubble Gum, and Chocolate all take a turn. This is one of those I could nose all day. The Orange note eventually takes center stage. The empty glass is sweet hay that transitions to milk chocolate. If the palate lives up to the nose, this one is special.
NEAT: Drying Oak, Orange Peel, and Tingling Black Pepper Spice dominate the first few sips. Slightly Oily, Coating mouthfeel. There is a Bubble Gum sweetness, mild at first but growing stronger the more time you spend with it. It has a Spicy, Slightly Astringent finish with Orange Peel, Cocoa and Cedar coating the palate. A mild Building KY Hug blooms in the chest. 
SPLASH: Ups the complexity. The Oak on the palate becomes sweeter, the astringency  mostly gone now. There are Floral notes and some Vanilla finally emerges and combines with the citrus to form Orange Creamsicle. The Oak and Black Pepper continue to layer on the palate with each sip. 

Verdict: I really like this one. Unique profile. It starts dry and spicy, then transitions to a Citrus/Floral sweet if you give it time to develop.  I hesitated to spend the $50 on this, but I'm glad I did. This is definitely going into heavy rotation."
