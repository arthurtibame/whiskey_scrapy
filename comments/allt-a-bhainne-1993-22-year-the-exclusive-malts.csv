4.0,"Pulling one of the, now, backlogged sample from round five on a semi-virtual scotch whisky tour. This pour provided through the one and only @LeeEvolved. 

Honey poured over cereal (think Grape Nuts) mixed with almonds, cinnamon, vanilla and apples. There is a musty dampness that hovers amongst the breakfast cereal as initially described; like a hay-filled barn on a rainy day.  Some slightly detectable notes of sherry as you let this open.  A pleasant nose. 

The nuttiness forms the basis of the palate. The honey sweetness is drizzled lightly providing a mild counter to the nutty dryness.  Grilled apricots and Gala apples add a fruity quality. There is a balanced cinnamon and black pepper spice that zings the palate.  All this contained in a thick, rich and oily body. 

The finish is oaky and dry, but not overtly so.  Cereal grains and cinnamon that slowly fades from the palate and goes deep and warm, everlasting. 

The latter part of the tour has brought some obscure, uncommon scotch. A good percentage disappointing.  This, however, is quite enjoyable.  Balanced, and consistent from nose through finish.  Well done. [90/100][Tasted: 5/18/18]"
4.0,"I’m finally able to get back into these last few samples from our group’s last round of trades.  I’ve been sidelined by bronchitis and a touch of the flu for the last 8-10 days.  This particular sample is my third supplied to the group as a part of our 5th of 7 rounds and is from the Allt-a-Bhainne distillery (pronounced ault ah van ya).  It is a Speyside distillery whose malt is primarily used in Chivas blends.  Having had a few Chivas in my day- I can definitely pick up of the bread and roasted nuts that provide the backbone for their blends here in this 22yo single cask that was bottled by The Creative Whisky Company.  It’s from their Exclusive Malts line, is cask strength at 50.7% ABV, and is natural in color and isn’t chill filtered.  It’s a beautiful, champagne gold in the taster and although being pretty oily- it doesn’t produce many legs- while leaving behind plenty of watery droplets after a spin.

The nose is all nuts and cereals with a nice layer of toffee and vanilla.  There’s hints of sherry cask, even though I don’t think they were used here.  It’s a deep and rich sweetness that’s very inviting.

The palate is spot on with the nose:  honey, nuts and fresh baked breads dominate the profile and even though it’s pretty hot- it’s well rounded and smooth.  The long slumber in oak has really worked its magic here.  I think this is the whisky’s saving grace, too.  This has been a very easy drinking bottle ever since I’ve opened it.

The finish is long and warming.  More bread notes linger and it even finishes more oily than dry.  A heavier than expected nutty aftertaste actually left me craving some Honey Nut Cheerios cereal and a glass of cold milk.  

Overall, I gotta give this one a full 4 stars.  It’s delicious and smooth and a heck of a deal ($109) for a well-aged, cask strength IB.  If I wasn’t so obsessed with trying new things I believe I’d seek out another bottle.  As is, I wouldn’t mind trying more from Allt-a-Bhainne- specifically a distillery bottling (if one exists).  Cheers."
4.0,"Tough to pronounce ""olt-uh-vaughn-ya"", but easy to sniff/drink! Confection sugar, vanilla, toffee, caramel, subtle spice, and red delicious apples come on the nose. Hot at 50.7 ABV, so can use a couple drops. Apple Jacks cereal on the palate, along with intense honey, and candied ginger. The finish is medium length and brings out dried apricots and baklava. The theme to the dram has got to be ""το ζειμπεκικο της ευδοκιας (Zeibekiko of Evdokia)"" Yes, I've gone Greecian on ya, and it's a solid 4.25!! Thanks so much for the experience @LeeEvolved !!"

4.0,"Stop number 73 on the SDT is Allt-A-Bhainne. Strange name, I know. This Speyside distillery was built during the post WWII economic boom in the U.K.  Virtually all of its production goes into Chivas Regal blends and the only single malts available are from independent bottlers like this 22 year old from The Exclusive Malts line from The Creative Whisky Company. 

Bottled at what I believe is cask strength of 50.7% ABV and I’m sure it’s non chill filtered and natural color of a honey gold. One of only 284 bottles that came from a single refill hogshead. Distilled on February 3rd 1993 and bottled in July of 2015. 

A full and strong nose. Very heavy cereal malt and honey. Freshly baked whole grain bread. Peanuts and cashews. It’s like they distilled a box of Honey Nut Cheerios, cardboard included (credit where credit is due, @LeeEvolved dialed me in on that note) Grilled apricots and plums. Slightly aromatic but no real smoke to speak of. A tad vegetal with some cooked celery. Dusty oak with some floral and earthy notes. A dusting of cinnamon and nutmeg. 

This is one of those whiskies where the palate follows the nose almost dead on. Cereals, honey, fresh heavy bread. More of that Honey Nut Cheerios feel to it. Grilled fruits, nuts and faint oak. A spiciness that is like cinnamon and pepper combined. 

A full bodied mouthfeel, oily, hot and mouthwatering. 
The finish is fairly long. No surprise that it is malt heavy with honey, a vague fruitiness and spice. 

This is a really good independent bottle. The Exclusive Malts line hasn’t disappointed me yet. This one is not very complex, but what it does have is done well and is strong. At about $110 it’s a good price for a 22 year old. Not something I would seek out as it’s not really my style, but hats off for the quality here. I did add a few drops of water and it toned down the spice and upped the honey and nuts. Thanks for the sample @LeeEvolved 3.75
Cheers"
4.0,"I got to try this unusual and a bit obscure malt, thanks to @LeeEvolved, as part of his official contribution  In our sampling team to go through every active distillery in Scotland.  Very typical Speysider: honey, cereals, bread baking in the oven aroma.  Same aroma simply extends to the palette.  There’s nothing spectacular or challenging to this, and it doesn’t need to be.  What it does, it does quite well...which is put together a good single malt at a mature age and affordable price tag.  I definitely wouldn’t seek this out or buy it for my own, since I feel what I got from it is what I’d get from a Glenfiddich 12 or Balvenie 12.  But, if I want to give a nice gift and make an impression of something mature and well aged, yet appealing to the masses, this would be a good option.  Thanks Lee for providing something I normally wouldn’t get a chance to try"
