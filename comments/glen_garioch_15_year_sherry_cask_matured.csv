4.0,"Nose - (w/o water) Sweet ""meaty"" sherry sweetness, rich dark cherries, dark apple/pear juice, cranberry juice (w/ water) Opens up a bit more, still meaty sherry, but seems a bit more ""bright""

Taste - (w/o water) Dark dried stone fruits, ginger spice/heat, dried cranberries, weird fruity bitterness, wet tobacco, orange pith bitter (w/ water) Opens up the dram a bit more, flavors ""pop"" more, brighter flavors and less dark fruit syrupy sweet, still has the ""meaty"" sweet sweetness

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering sweet stone fruits, lingering ginger heat, light fruity bitterness (w/ water) Lingering dried cranberry, dried cherry sweet, light fruity bitterness remains

Score - 82/100

Final Thoughts - This was quite interesting in that I get this sort of fruity/savory meaty sweet from this. Similar to Dalmore, but more pleasant. This for me is more on the sweet side and leans more towards a dessert dram. Water does wonders for this dram & opens it up quite a bit.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

5.0,"dark and dry sherry nose with dried fruits, oak and alcohol. With water it opens up and becomes very enticing. 
The palate is typical and well made for solely Oloroso cask maturation. Fruits, cinnamon, sweet and oak with a long lasting pleasant aftertaste.
This dram plays in the same ballpark as Aberlour A'bunadh, Glendronach CS or Kavalan Solist Sherry and is a worthy contender among those expressions and worth a try for sure!"
