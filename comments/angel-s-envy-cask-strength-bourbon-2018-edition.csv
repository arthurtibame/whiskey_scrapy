4.0,"Sweet start, late warming."
3.5,"I picked this up a few days ago after neglecting bourbon for the better part of this year and decided to delve into a side by side comparison with the traditional Angel’s Envy which I had not yet opened either. I decided to start both neat and then slowly (one drop at a time) water down the 124 proof cask strength.

The nose of the traditional was brown sugar, woodsy, allspice and black pepper. After spending a lot of time exclusively with scotch the brown sugar was the most evident here making it almost sickly sweet for me. 

The nose of the CS was definitely banana as mentioned and I would go as far to say banana foster with some cinnamon and cream. The alcohol is very evident when dipping my nose into the Glencarin. 

The palate on the traditional was cherry syrup, leather, baking spices with a twinge of orange at the end which actually gives this bourbon a nice balance all things considered. I would consider the finish to be medium. I really wanted this to stick with me longer but this is my only complaint.

The palate on the CS was a wakeup call but also provided intense sweet notes of fig, dark brown sugar, and chocolate. The more water I added the more chocolate came through but I think I broke the charm somewhere around 15 drops of water which I consider to be a lot. We will call this a resilient whiskey. Strangely I could not find any banana on the palate no matter the amount of water. Finish is insanely long and high octane with a wood bite but is balanced with that brown sugar. 

I really enjoyed comparing these side by side and as I sipped I considered value. The traditional can be picked up for $50 in my parts while the CS was $180. While I definitely think the CS is a more fun bourbon with the “pick your own adventure” option with how much water you want to add, but I don’t see the CS being worth the coin. I would rather spend my money elsewhere. 

I also do want to put a plug in for wonky finished whisky. I personally think this is where the future of American whiskey will have to go to differentiate themselves from just another wheated bourbon. A prime example of this is Whistlepig Old world cask finish or the Boss Hog series. Rest in peace Dave Pickerell.  

All in all these are both damn fine drams and I easily recommend the traditional Angel’s Envy but only recommend the 2018 Cask Strength to someone who has to have a special edition to display on a shelf. The traditional just has too much value. 

Traditional – 4.25/5

Cask Strength – 3.5/5 when considering price point. If this were $100 it would be right up there with the traditional"

Taste - Caramel, sweet raisins 
Finish - Dark Chocolate, fresh figs 
$229 steep but worth it if you like raisins figs and banana caramel."

2.0,"For the $200 price tag you expect a lot. Unfortunately this is a complete miss by angels envy. 

I was hoping for some complexity given the price tag. Too one dimensional. I will not be purchasing anymore limited editions from angels envy."
3.0,Smooth but bland
3.75,"Smells like roses, bright red color, super cool looking. Kind of syrupy when I first sip it, and those sweet floral notes dominate. Some spice afterwards, but it's a deep spice. Roses, not a flavor I see often. Syrupy and rich, tastes thick"

2.0,"Had this in a blind taste test and in conclusion was very disappointed in it. 

The nose was very reminiscent of normal stuff so I knew it was angels envy. 

I was very disappointed with this release. It was smooth for such a high proof but was incredibly dry and one dimensional. It didn’t have near the complexity one would expect for a limited release and the price in which you pay. If you’re going to expect the consumer to pay $200, it better blow your normal stuff out of the water. In the end it failed to do this. 

It wasn’t even close to the complexity you expect out of a limited release. In fact it wasn’t complex at all. I did add a little water to it after I had the first few sips which did open it up and brought out more Carmel flavors.

All in all was very disappointed in this and would advise people to pick up the normal angels envy and skip this."

4.75,"Neat.  Vanilla. Raisins.  Baking spice and chocolate on the nose.  Cherries.  Lots going on.  Creamy texture, chocolate on the tongue.  Lots of vanilla, cherries, cinnamon, cola.  That is super tasty.  The legs are an overwhelming flavor bomb.  That vanilla and cola just linger forever.  Really impressed.  It was too damn expensive... but I am not disappointed."

4.75,"I love this. I am a fan of the sweeter bourbons, as well as a fan of the standard Angel's Envy. Imagine a wonderfully sweet but not overpowering bourbon with a creamy high horsepower start. Stronger flavors of the original port finish roll back to a nice bite. Quick, but not disappointing finish."

5.0,"Wow! This is a really warm, big boy Bourbon. My first taste had the longest finish I have ever experienced from a bourbon. The 124% will impress you and you will suddenly realize you won't be drinking glasses full of this even if you try to tame it with ice or a bit of water. This is the bourbon to share with your bourbon buddies. It's strong and long on taste. I real bourbon lovers bourbon. Dark golden cognac color with an abundance a spice.  You'll detect warm cola, caramel, raisin tastes, under a sweet honey first impression.  When I uncorked to smelled, I first noted honey, so I thought It would be sweeter than it is. I was delighted with all the different flavors and spices calling out to my tongue as I waited through that marathon finish. Ranked the ""Best Spirit in the World"" in F.  Paul Pacult's 2013 Spirit Journal. Angel's Envy cask strength is unlike any bourbon I have ever tasted. Marvelous.Got it for $229.00"

4.25,Smooth forward.  Sweet finish
3.5,"On the nose, chalk, cinnamon, fresh linens, unripe fruit, brine, soy sauce and sesame oil. Velvety on the tongue, decent mouth feel. Sweet, cola, dark chocolate and coriander at the end. More complex than previous years, but maybe more particular. 6/2/19"
2.25,"So let's begin by saying that I count my purchase of the 2017 Angels Cask Strength as one of the worst purchases I have made to date. I made it on a whim and the subsequent tastings over the last 18 months have not come close to justifying the cost. I share this to say that I was more than skeptical about the 2018 batch being any better. So let's dive in to find out!
On the palette it's a bit rough and very hot even clocking in at 124 proof. The predominant notes are fig, chocolate, cinnamon with a hint of raisins. The mid palette and medium finish feature toffee, oak and and earthy note that I can't quite place. Again the finish is hot. Very hot. Adding ice tames the spice and heat some but doesn't really open it up much. 
Look, I am now more convinced then ever that the standard Angels is proofed at a relatively low 86.6 proof to compensate for the hot and hard edges of this Whiskey. So, if you have to add that much water to it, is it really worth forking out 3x as much for this edition?? In short, hard no! 
This is a great example of an overhyped Bourbon that is not worth close to it's SRP. As always my rating factors in the price of the dram.
Cheers all!"

4.25,"Nose- plum, banana, honey, burnt wood, with water dates come out, cherry cola

Palate- plum, cola, floral, caramel, herbal, chocolate, toasted oak, figs, cherry cola with water

Finish- long, drying finish with notes of dry oak and coca cola

Great, unique taste, opens up with a bit of water. Love the cola notes on the palate and finish. Delicious banana on the nose is fantastic and unique. Only downfall for me is the super drying effect on the mouth with the finish. Normally I like a dry finish... but this one dries out all the flavors from the finish and leaves an off feeling in the mouth. Aside from that, it’s solid."
