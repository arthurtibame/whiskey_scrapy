5.0,"Great nose, with standard oak, green apple or pear, hints of spice. Seems to be a lot going in. As with all Pulteney's it also boasts a lovely maritime sea saltiness. 

Caramel on the palate with a sherry sweetness that is on the lighter side, but still sweet. That Pulteney saltiness woven perfectly throughout."
4.0,"Marmalade more than the apple of the 12 year old. Good, but I'm not sure that for me the 17 year is a better mix of the two."
5.0,"Nose: Fruits, like green apples and pears. Very smooth with spicy and floral notes. Some vanilla and even sea breeze in a smooth way. Pure luxury for your senses – and did I mention it was smooth?

Taste: Hints of peat and peppers but mostly, sweet malt. After addition of water, honey and caramel rise to dominate.

Finish: Lasts long and good. A bit dry with delicate spices. Vanilla and fruits are like velvet for your throat.

Balance: In great balance, very smooth, yet charismatic whisky. Keeps getting better every step of the way. The marvellous finish is like the main event of an entertaining show."

5.0,"What happens when you achieve the perfect balance of peat and fruit? Whisky nirvana. The stunning level of balance presented on the nose lends it a unique creaminess unlike anything I've tried. The marriage of bourbon, sherry, and smoke plays out on the tongue like an orchestral symphony. There's also the placebo effect of salt air lingering in the recess of your mind all the while. Truly sublime and for me, close to a perfect dram. Now, if only I could rate it higher. (5.5/5)"

5.0,"Bought a sample of this tonight over our monthly date night.  I've had a few Old P's previously...always thought they were good, just nothing great.  I stand corrected on this 21 yr old.   Lemon shortbread cookies on the nose.  Sort of like the old fashioned ones they had in prim and proper British tea houses.  Really rich and elegant on the palette, mixed with a wisp of smoke and salinity.  As if a Dalmore, Talisker and Balvenie had a love child.  If any negative, it's gotta be in the finish.  I found it a bit bitter and long, sort of like orange rinds.  I paid $7 for a 2 oz pour...no idea what a full bottle is costing, but I'll definaltey be looking out for one if I find it at a reasonable price"

5.0,"This is a contender for my all-time favourite whisky. Just wonderful stuff.

The nose, palate and finish are the conclusion of a story that starts with Old Pulteney 12 year old, continues development through the 17 year old, and finally reaches its climax here. The spirit-driven 12 year contains the fresh, zesty cereal, salty and honey features that form the basis of this family of whiskies. 5 years of extra maturation with sherry cask influence produces the 17 year old and adds oak and spices into the mix, providing greater depth and balancing the dryness of the 12 year old. Another 4 years of the same treatment and you arrive here, where all the previous elements have now melded into a fascinatingly rich and characterful whisky.

Old Pulteney is one of those whiskies, like Springbank, that can take very long maturation with dignity and IMHO this is a textbook example of how to do sherry maturation the right way. This is no simple winey ""overlay"", but the addition of body and a subtle rounding of the distillate's native dryness. It's robust sherry CASK you smell and taste, not just sherry, and it is a delight.

Amazingly smooth, rich, rounded and full of aromas and flavours so diverse you could take hours analyzing a glass. Vanilla, stewed fruits, citrus fruits, apples, pears, raisins, brine, honey, sherry, orange peel, cinnamon, clove, allspice, cream, brown sugar, leather, aromatic tobacco - it's all there and more. The only thing you won't find is floral notes, sourness or bitterness.

""Outstanding"" : 5 stars"

5.0,"It's as good as they say it is...but it doesn't come on strong. No, the OP 21 sees no need to fling itself at you; this is not a dram desperate to be loved by whoever comes its way. Rather, it displays an almost shy nose - soft, light, creme  brulee, baked apple with cinnamon. Once you taste it, though...well, my exact phrase on my tasting sheet is ""the Holy Trinity is this good."" Maybe I'll go to hell for that (not really), but this is an insanely smooth, well-integrated single malt. The baked apple and cinnamon are there on the palate, with an almost buttery quality, along with the sea breeze and citrus (albeit now orange) that mark Old Pulteney's whiskies. There's even a light, pipe tobacco note to be found - according to head distiller Malcom Waring, it's a result of the water's drainage through a peat bog, as all of their barley is unpeated. I could strive to write out more notes, but at the end of the day, there is an almost mystical quality to this dram that beggars adjectives and descriptions. It simply is an example of what good whisky can be, and it is worth the steep price tag...every cent of it."

4.5,"Introduces itself with the most delicious aromas of coffee cake drizzled with caramel sauce. Explore and you’ll find hints of peanut skins too. The taste evolves to bitter orange rind covered in dark chocolate, with an undercurrent of zesty nutmeg. I had originally marked this as a five when I tasted it in a bar at the start of the year, but I didn’t quite taste perfection when I opened a bottle at home last night. The middle is a little frustrating: some sips deliver caramel, others feel a little thin. Nevertheless, it’s a classy whisky that will be missed and I’m happy to have stashed away a couple of bottles after Pulteney announced its discontinuation."

5.0,This is exactly what I expected from a 21 year old malt from the coastal Highlands. Beautifully rich with vanilla and toffee notes from the bourbon casks. Slight sherry as well. Only a slight bite despite being 43%. There is a bit of that maritime saltiness in there as well. Old Pulteney stayed true to its character and created a true masterpiece! Too bad it’s discontinued for now but I’m happy to have gotten the last bottle at my store. 96 points.

5.0,"Nose - Vanilla butterscotch, fruity brine, dark barrel aged apple/pear cider, caramel apples.

Taste - Creamy mouthfeel, gentle white pepper tingle, vanilla butterscotch, sweet white wine soaked sultanas & plums, golden raisins, baked apples/pears, toasted brioche, milk chocolate.

Finish - Lingering chocolatly foam, oak aged fruity pear/apple cider, light white pepper tingle.

Score - 91/100

Final Thoughts - I am very pleasantly surprised by this one. It is quite delicious, very well balanced throughout and dangerously easy to sip on. Nice chocolaty caramel apple-like on the palate, but doesn't punch you in the face for any of the flavors. Zero off putting notes and flavors that you could enjoy any time of day. Probably best enjoyed neat, but I could see this working very well in a more subtle spirit forward cocktail too, like a chocolate old fashioned.

Would I drink it if offered? - YES

Would I specifically order it? - YES

Would I buy a bottle? - Maybe"

5.0,"Nose: A seamlessly intertwined bouquet of aromas including stewed fruits, malted barley, strong honey of several types (manuka, leatherwood, redgum), blood oranges, raisins, brine, cinnamon, allspice, leather, aromatic pipe tobacco, red apple, pear and toffee. Threading through all this is a sublime sherry-cask presence. Not just sherry and oak aromas sitting in the background, but a powerful active sherry cask personality. There's also the smell of brown sugar and butter being cooked together in preparation for making butterscotch muffins.

Palate: A complex arrival that combines sweet, salt, fruity and honey flavours. A rich, creamy, development as massive malted caramel tones and some precise gingery spice emerge to play with butterscotch and stewed figs on a field of both sweet and dry sherry that is gently seasoned with cinnamon, clove and nutmeg.

Finish: Medium/long. Spicy fruit and honey flavours gently fade into the sunset leaving an aftertaste of slightly drying salt and lingering warm spicy ginger.

This is one of my all-time favourite whiskies. It is a fascinatingly rich and characterful dram, but simultaneously comforting and reassuring. It is magnificent right from the moment it is poured, but will continue to open and evolve for ages.

Tasting this whisky is like a long, captivating conversation with one of your childhood heroes who, once you meet them, actually exceeds your expectations.

The nose is textbook. There's no other word for it. This is the nose to emulate if you want to create a great unpeated whisky. The palate is huge and very rewarding with a majestic texture, and the finish is the perfect dignified finale to the proceedings.  The whole experience makes you fall back in your chair with a contented groan of ""oh, yes"".

This is a desert island dram and worth 6 stars - it is, quite simply, perfection and I was gutted when I heard last year that it was being withdrawn.

I'd recommend tasting it neat, or with the addition of just 2 drops of water, but however you take it, don't rush the experience. This wonderful malt demands time and respect, and will repay the effort many times over.  Diluting this with sparkling water, soft drinks or ice is forbidden. The universe will punish those who transgress.

This re-review is based on the last drams of my last bottle. Tomorrow some mates are coming over to assist me in polishing off the remainder. Auld lang syne.

5.0,"Once again a massive thank you to @Scott_E for this outstanding pour! I have been saving this sample for the Holiday Weekend and was beyond impressed with how good it was! 
I was also surprised with how different it was from the 17yr as the Sherry influence was far more pronounced here, in the best way. Let's dive in:
On palatte it's a wonderful buttery entry with a complex array of orchard fruits, strawberries, graham crackers, honey with a hint of banana and baking spice. The sea air and brine note is much more in the background with this expression but is also around. Mid palette adds a cherry pie and jam note that leads to a lonnnggg fruit, oak and spice driven finish. As it tails off the brine note tingles on the tongue. 
I just love this Whisky. It's a wonderful pour and very complex. One of the best I have had to date for sure. At $180 in my local market , it certainly not cheap but it's definitely a special dram worth that price of admission in my opinion. 
Thanks again @Scott_E, I think you have now raised my perception of what a great non Peated Scotch should taste like! 
Cheers all and Happy Tuesday."

4.5,"It lived to my expectations. Spectacular on the nose, nice on the palate. 

Bottled at 46%abv, with a burnished color.

On the nose is amazing. The most sweet dram i have ever nosed without a doubt. Caramelized apples, brown sugar, chocolate, lemon, prunes, caramel rolls, sophisticated vanilla, cinnamon, hints of liquorice. Sweet and complex. 

On the palate is delicious but can be too sweet and can numb your palate. Liquorice,  caramel, apples.
A full tobacco sensation as soon as it hits the tongue, transforms into a pleasant elegant hotness.
Full mouth sensation. Even the nose gets a little action. Herbal notes, very pleasant. The spices are very balanced. An amazing dram truly. Very enjoyable. Made for experienced drinkers. Lots of cinnamon in the nose and palate. Just the right amount. Finish is long but too sweet even for me.

Overall i give this baby a 93 over a 100. Absolutely recommended."
5.0,"Old Pulteney 12 was one first single malts I came upon in my whisky journey and have been a top favorite of mine.  Well, tonight was a good night for a pour as I am able to take my time in my solitude and really delve in.  The 17 and 21 I have briefly tasted at Whiskyfest 2017.  Since then I needed to have these for my own. Best of that 2017 night, for me, was this 21 year old. 

The pour is a light golden amber color. 

The nose begins as tropical-fruity, dark chocolate. Slowly as is opens, the briny maritime notes merge into the tropical fruits.  Orange creamsicle bursts open and wonderfully dominates.  It does weaken and the dance of aromas start to work together.  Saw dust, vanilla custard,  oatmeal raisin bread, honey and lemon hold the aroma line.  The collective aromas are all soft, rounded and gentle. 

First entry on the palate is ginger root prickly.  After acclimation, the palate can begin to detect the flavors.  Oranges, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, wood char provide the vibrant side.  But there is a soft, sweet to counter.  Butterscotch, golden honey, toasted coconut, dried pineapple  and syrupy dates. 

If you want your dram to be sweeter, taking the prickly nature away, add a small dash of water. 

The finish is medium-long with the ginger prickle and honey that slowly fade to wood dryness with a pinch of salt. All to a deep and soul warming joy. 

I am a big fan of Old Pulteney. The 12 has accompanied me on many a beach house vacation.  This 21 is one to nurse slowly; savor it all. The parts and the whole.  A wonderful sipper that would be perfect for a beach sunset or by a warming winter fire.  I was able to snag two bottles. One for enjoying now and another for some future unknown purposeful sharing.  I am glad I am able to currently enjoy as, alas, this will be soon, if not already, have gone the way of the Dodo.  [96/100][$169][Tasted: 2/28/20]"
4.0,"Bottled 2017.  Time to have two old Old Pulteney’s, 17 and 21, side by side!

To unambiguously declare the winner, OP 21 is a special whisky, and OP 17 is not.  I commend the OP 17 for its balancing of spirit and cask character.  The OP 21 is mostly cask, and it is spectacular.

I’m guessing this whisky started its maturation in a bourbon cask, and then spent numerous years in a second maturation in sherry casks.  This is bombastically fruity.  You get deep notes of berries, citrus, cherries, bananas, kiwis.  The malt character is in the background, and it says, “pie.”  Berry pie, orange pie, cherry pie, banana pie, kiwi pie.  There is a huge fruity and biscuity quality that compares favorably with Redbreast 21.  The finish is again fruit pie, but also fairly woody and spicy.

I am sad I only ever purchased one bottle of this, and I can no longer find it on shelves. 

Score: * (unforgettably good) 
How much does a bottle cost: Secondary market pricing is probably around $200-$300 right now.  I don’t see these on shelves any more.
How much do I think a bottle is worth: $200"
4.5,"Kory and I went in on this bottle together prior to its discontinuation. This whisky invites time and careful consideration. It’s not going at anyone else’s pace. Old Pulteney 21 smells like barrel-aged stout, toasted cashews, vanilla, light peat smoke, and polished leather. The palate offers hints of brine, and suggests red fruit and black currant. The rich and nutty notes from the nose are emphasized here as well. But the most delightful aspect of the palate is the patient and storied oak. It’s truly captivating. The mouthfeel is balanced; oily, but not overwhelmingly so. The finish is smooth and round, bringing a slow but sure heat. The aftertaste is reminiscent of vanilla and plum. One to enjoy in solitude, and when there’s nothing else that needs to be done."
