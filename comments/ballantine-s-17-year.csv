4.0,"The nose is quite complex. Quite pungent especially for a blend, you smell fruit, cinnamon, quite nutty and vegetal peat. Palate: balanced, medium power, very herbal and a bit astringent. Fruity and nutty, and of course pretty smooth. Finish: medium with lingering spice and vegetal peat. 

This is an interesting blend because it literally tastes like they made it with some lapgroiag. It's very different from the chivas where the chivas is really fruity. Ballantines 17 tastes fruity with vegetal peat smoke"

3.0,"Jim Murray Whisky of the year... Classic Blend, Affordable price! nearly tickets all the boxes... nearly... short on the finish and i found it slightly lighter for a 17 years.
 Worth a try to see what all the fuss is about."

4.0,At least a 3.5. Smooth and not very strong. Nice spices in nose. Flavour could be more rich.

3.0,"A nice blend with a good tang on the tongue. A bit of citrus, some peat and little smoke. It had a nice long finish."

4.0,"Blowhard Jim Murray's Whisky of the Year in 2011. Copper colour (seems artificial), though decent legs. Nose is light, but actually quite nice. Sea salt, vanilla, toffee. Maple syrup, fresh fruit (apples, pear). Light smoke and fresh peat in waves. A grassy, heather honey floralness. Melons and faint pretzel dough (a flavour I get in many blends). Sweet taste, bordering on too sweet. Apple, pear, vanilla, maple syrup, toffee/caramel, and very light peat/sea salt. Soft pepper and spice, especially if you let it sit on the tongue. Short finish of fruit and vanilla and sweet wood. Very much a ""tour of Scotland""-type blend that hits most of the major notes across the different regions/styles of the country (Speyside fruits, Islay smoke, island brine, sherried sweetness, etc.,); a nice blend, but it really does lean a bit too sweet for my tastes. Not *demonstrably* better than a number of blends half the price, but quite enjoyable--I finished the bottle awhile ago (tasting notes are from an old notebook), but I think fondly upon this whisky. Not *too* fondly, however. Ultimately, it's one of that genre of luxury whiskies that's got more prestige than flavour--even if I did quite enjoy the flavours that *are* here."

Woody taste with a bit of bite to it. Longer finish than most. Some herbs come out, basil and thyme if you're looking for it."

4.0,"I've started buying this lately, maybe my 5th bottle and I'm using it as my aperitif or gateway whisky before moving on to richer, stronger stuff.

It's got some great flavours and a surprising amount of smoke at times but for $99 locally it's expensive vs some single malts.

Still like it though."

4.5,"Surprisingly peaty..... Very different from the 30 year bottle.... Or the 12 year.  The immediate sweetness comes through right away right after the smokiness.  The floral scent was really pleasant.  The pricing I felt is a little more expensive ar $99, that may be because this was harder to find in CA"

4.5,"The best blended whisky to date. So complex yet so smooth. Rich honey on the nose with subtle briney peat (subtly Talisker-esque) with slight green fruits (pear/apple). On the palate, quite malty progressing to dark chocolate/cocoa. The subtle peat lingers with slight leather. The finish? A gradual controlled crescendo of vanilla cream and a peppery, spiced cinnamon finish. A heartwarming drawn out finish with gradual warming of the chest.
An amazing blend. So much complexity yet so well directed and steered fron start to finish."

4.5,"Even if i hated Ballantine's finest and Ballantine's 12yo, i went to a club last night and after looking the liquor chart, the only one i did not had before was this Ballantine's 17yo. Obviously i asked to see the bottle and it had a gorgeous old-looking label. 

Well, this is a very good dram. I wouldn't buy it, but i recognize there is a galaxy of difference between the horrible finest and 12yo from this one. 

Bottled at 43%abv, with a chesnut oloroso sherry color.

On the nose the first note is salt and some dry grass. After breathing a little it changes to a sweeter aroma, with vanilla cream, milk chocolate and butter cake. I think it was a little dim and i rated it 21 over 25. 

On the palate is much much better. And i believe this is the most wonderful hobbie in the world (to review whiskies) because it shows you how a cereal note can be awful sometimes and other times is pleasant. This dram felt very good in the palate with  tobbacco and cereal notes, pleasant hotness, and a peppery sensation that numbs your lips a little. Some smoke too.

The aftertaste is long and nice, very mouth watering. 

Overall i rate this dram with a particular high note: 91 over 100 (because of my rating system) but it felt more like an 89 over 100. In any case it is a good dram (that i wouldn't buy) and it deserves the high score i have given to it."
