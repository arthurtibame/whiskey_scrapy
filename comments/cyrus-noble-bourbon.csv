3.0,"It's not a bad bourbon. The price tag hurts it. Pretty typical rye bourbon notes. Kind of an uneventful flat finish. A little citrus, and caramel up front.  For my money, I'd buy Evan Williams single barrel."

3.0,"It's 5 year old juice from Heaven Hill (they don't say it outright, but the clues--and the flavour profile--point right to it), and that's fine--except I can get older, better Heaven Hill juice locally for so much cheaper. Not a bad whiskey, it's just hurt by its pricetag and competition. Flavours of chalky vanilla, grape drink cream soda, corn husk, rye. Leather, cinnamon. Caramel corn, cut grass. Chocolate, orange zest, a bit boozey. Banana, custard, a distant lumber yard. Light in the mouth and very ""typical"" bourbon flavours. Maple, mint. Fine bourbon that does an adequate rendition of what I expect from bourbon. But I'll stick with Evan Williams Black Label or Single Barrel for my Heaven Hill fix."

4.0,"Old worn leather nose. Reminds me of chewing the laces of my baseball glove as a kid (minus the salt).  I held the juice forward in my mouth hitting the front part of my tongue, adding a little oxygen (my wife hates it when I do this, she calls it slurping) helps open up the rich tobacco and orange flavor.  There is almost no heat until the finish.  Which grabs the sides of your tongue and back of your throat.  I love this whiskey.  Reminds me of being dirty and playing baseball all day."

3.25,"I found this Bourbon easy to drink, but the herbal or grass note was fairly strong. I tried it without knowing the history at all and thought it might be sourced form MGP with it's Rye notes. Hearing it's from Heaven Hill is surprising for me."
4.25,A surprise - nothing jumps out for as a flavour lead. Very smooth easy profile ... for sipping at home with friends
