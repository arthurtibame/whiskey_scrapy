5.0,"Wow, amazing blend of sherry-cask rice whiskeys spanning nearly three decades. Creamy butterscotch body. Might be a little too sweet for some, but I found it a delicious nightcap."

5.0,"This shochu whisky hybrid goes down very smooth. Notes of berries from sherry influence, brown sugar, toffee, chocolate, nuts, raisins, coffee, floral, vanilla, and cinnamon with a nice sake like earthiness."
