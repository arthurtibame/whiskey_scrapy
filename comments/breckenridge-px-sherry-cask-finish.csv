4.0,"We rented the distillery for an after hours private tour.  We sampled every one of the products (11 in all) except for the Dark Arts Single Malt Whiskey.  This was by far my favorite product.  I already enjoyed their bourbon, and the PX Sherry casks just smooth it out a touch more and give it a nice fruity smell."

3.25,"Definitely Sherry on the nose and sweet. Get a bit of spice and the expected sherry taste, but something with the after taste seems off."

3.75,"Spicy at the beginning, scotch-like smoke, oak, with a long smooth finish. It feels and tastes like a higher proof than 90. On the nose I get the spice followed with some sweeter notes almost like cake."
2.5,"Quick Hit: Bananas and caramel nose. Bitter, spice, vanilla. Wood spicy finish.  Nose is the best part of the whiskey."

3.0,"Vanilla and orange with spice on the nose. Trade is orange zest, slight spice and pepper, oak (bark), very cherry on the finish with brown sugar sweetness.
Finish is quick and sharp sweet cherry. Almost astringent bitterness that continues to build. This is similar to the bitter part of pecans. Overall, this is like drinking am old fashion with a bitter pecan finish."

4.0,"Tried in an Old Fashioned- A lemon zest discard, along with a traditional orange zest, is welcome here. The citrus sits very well on the rich, round character of the PX Sherry. After dilution, there is no doubt about the chocolate after taste."
3.0,A little aftertaste (spicy) but past sip able to drinkable.
