5.0,"38 years in a barrel (bottled 2016) and 39 years on earth for me. Yes this is my birth year whiskey - 1977. The first event on the cards to celebrate my impending 40th next month was to crack this and a number of other good bottles for sharing with a group of mates who love whiskey in a friday night session. And then separate catchups  for those who couldn't make it later. So I've tried this at least 4 times over the last two weeks. The bottle does the label justice - cedar wood, hint of raspberry and of course port. Finally a top notch port whisky. I'm not usually a fan but this one is excellent. Now I get a hint of the Benriach new make coming through which I'm not a huge fan of sometimes but the casks take the centre stage and deliver well. Definitely a 4.5. I'd buy it again for sure at ~ $120 - $150 USD mark but this at around $400USD was well north of that. Really this should be a 4 on that basis but hell I'll let sentiment carry the day and round up. It'll be another decade before I try a bottle of whiskey of this age, price and quality :-)"
