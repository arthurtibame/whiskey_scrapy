4.0,"After almost finishing my first bottle of the current Rare Breed (116.8 proof), I found an older bottle and decided to compare them.
Here’s what I got on this one.

The nose has milk chocolate, some baking spices, vanilla, and a hint of plumb.

The palate is a little sweet with a slightly thicker mouthfeel. It has some vanilla, honey, a little rye, and slight fruitiness.

The finish is medium in length and has a little burn, and at a times a very slight momentary bit of ethanol. 

Compared to the 116.8 proof version, I would say this (112.8 proof) is not quite as good. When I first nosed it, it definitely reminded me of the newer one. But after comparing them back to back, the newer 116.8 proof has more complexity and depth. Maybe it’s because it’s the end of the bottle so it’s oxidized more, and I was comparing that to a fresh bottle of the the older 112.8 proof? Who knows.
My thoughts are that they’re getting better with every release. So I’m not going to seek out these rarer older bottles."

4.0,"Caramel and chocolate on the nose before the ethanol shows up.  The alcohol burn hits the tongue pretty quick.  A lot of spice.  It’s definitely tastier after breathing a bit.  Fruity, lots of rye spice."
3.75,Ethanol on the nose with some citrus.  Sweetness on the tongue - caramel and butterscotch before the alcohol reveals itself on the nose.  The finish has an astringency to it with spice galore.

4.25,Can’t believe this was sitting on a shelf in January of 2020!
3.75,"Seriously sweet. I’m not the biggest bourbon fan so that turned me off a bit. I have to admit it’s smooth for the proof. But when I do cross over to bourbon I prefer something a little more subtle. Russell 10 yr does the trick. 

Update: This does really well in the bottle and takes a teaspoon or two of water and opens up nicely. I can see why bourbon drinkers like this."

4.5,"Cherry, Brown Sugar, raspberry"
4.75,"Preferred this even over the recent 116.8 offering. This is a classic Bourbon with plenty of spice, vanilla, caramel and heat. This baby is nice neat or with an ice chip or really amps up a cocktail. Such a great bottle of higher proof Bourbon with lots of fire character 
As others have said, this offering is gone so if you see on the shelf you do not think or ponder, you simply buy it."

2.75,"I just never gave up hope...
Initially, too much ethanol on the nose. Couldn't enjoy it at all. And there was too much heat on the palate. Adding water or ice just did not make it better. 
Fast forward 5 months, and this whiskey is finally starting to come into its own.
The nose is now more pleasant, with cinnamon, powdered chocolate, rye and baking spices.
The palate is still too hot for me neat. Some ice tames it and allows the sweet corn to peek through with some orange and cherry notes.
The finish is still a little rough. It's hot and long, with some residual rye and corn notes.

I hope it continues to mellow and improve over the next few months."
4.25,"Sweet fire. Super high proof, but the burn is absent in light of the sweet and spice. It's like drinking a sweet spicy flame. Vanilla almost like ice cream, long tingly tail. Smells amazing. Magnificent."
3.5,"Nose: sweet with butterscotch, corn

Palate: much more spicier than the nose

Finish: rich and warm

Lots of spice in this one. It’s a richer and spicier WT101, stronger obviously, so if it’s your thing..."
