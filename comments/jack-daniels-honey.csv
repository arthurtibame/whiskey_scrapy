3.75,"Light honey color, go figure. Aroma is light honey with some floral notes in the background. The honey is forefront in the flavor making it on the sweet side, but not too much. Some pepper notes in the background. I actually like it more than I expected."

2.0,"Advent calendar day one. First sip was like cough medicine as a kid. Not a fan. However, the honey is well balanced and not over powering or syrupy. Like it better than say Jim Beam Honey. Surprising long finish that warms the chest for 70 proof. Actually tastes better after you coat your inners. Ha!"

null,"Jack standard w/what is identifiable as honey but has a (what I think is an) artificial overtone that is blunt. Idk where it’s coming from since it supposed to be natural. Had it neat, on ice and in mixed drinks. Last resort..."

5.0,This is my go to for after dinner. I love the sweetness in it. I know its mostly just a mixer but I love drinking it with just a splash of water. It really opens up the sweetness then.

3.75,"Amazing on the nose and in the palate. Honey and coffee in the nose. Honey, chocolate and a little wooden flavor. No kick. It is tricky, can get you drunk. the problem is that it doesnt feel like it is a whiskey (and it is not)."

null,"My first whiskey I've ever owned, since getting into drinking it, got bought as gift for myself.  The notes I can smell are honey and a lot of it and a slight chocolate, I tried it with water and was very unpleasant, then had it neat and was much better. Not going to rate it  until I can compare against others."

3.0,"I would call this a ""liqueur whiskey"". You can smell the honey even before you taste it, and it feels almost syrupy in your mouth. Definitely sweet, though the sweetness takes away from the alcohol burn. There isn't much complexity to this whiskey; you're buying it for the honey flavour. Easy to enjoy neat or on ice, or certainly if you've got some cocktail in mind. But I can imagine that whiskey ""purists"" wouldn't waste their time or money on this variant (similar to those who don't like flavoured coffee). 
[Note the price I've given is for a half bottle, 375 mL.)"

2.0,"This is a very weird whiskey. Hard to call it a whiskey, and not a whiskey liqueur. The nose is a weird musty smelling honey, and to me the taste is the same but with a little banana taste. It hardly feels like whiskey, and the honey dulls the burn, which I’m surprised that I wish was there. 

I’m trying to think of how I could use this in cocktails, but I can’t really think of any way to mix it and still enjoy it. Yeah... I really don’t think I like this at all. It’s so sweet it would make me sick to drink more than an Ounce."
