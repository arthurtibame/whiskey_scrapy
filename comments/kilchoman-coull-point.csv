4.25,"Nose: in the machir bay way.
Grilled Pears, bbq smoke, ananas, peach apricots, see weed.

The palate is very sweet and slaty, fruit6 with that smoke around everything.

Very dangerous for me since I loved it at the first kiss."

3.75,"Un nez tourbé et légèrement salin, comme une fumée d'allumette.
En bouche, ça rentre sec et fumé, c'est fort mais c'est très bon. On sent des agrumes mais je sais pas dire quoi.
La finale est sympa et vanillée, mais pas inoubliable."
3.0,"Second sample of a 7 part Kilchoman (custom) sample set my wife got me for my birthday. On the nose, after having tasted the Saligo Bay, I found the Coull Point a bit rounder in the smoke, more BBQ-like. I also got some baked pears, and a mossy scent. As with the Saligo Bay, the smoke is somewhat subdued in the palate, is a tad sweeter than I would have expected, probably due to the sherry influences, but also a bit salty. The body is fuller than the Saligo Bay.
Both Saligo Bay and Coull Point are fine drams. Not sure wether I would purchase the Saligo Bay, but I wouldn't hesitate for the Coull Point."
