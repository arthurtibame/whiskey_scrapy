3.5,"Musky and young. Almost maple syrup sappiness on the nose with corn and whole wheat bread. The alcohol isn’t overbearing on the palette, but it tastes mostly of creamed corn. Would love to take a trip to this distillery this was a delightful surprise"

3.0,"Slight agave smell and taste, maybe from the high alcohol content. I tried it best without water. I could tell the alcohol content was high but it wasn't overpowering."
5.0,"Instantly became my new favorite evening sipper. Spicy and sweet, even my wife, who prefers rum cocktails, likes it over ice. The flavor of corn comes through the spice of the rye. Just a really enjoyable whiskey!"
