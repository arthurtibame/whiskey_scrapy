5.0,"John Howie Steak Seattle, WA Single Barrel Select. Nose - Dark brown sugar, vanilla, dark chocolate cocoa nibs, marzipan, coffee infused dark chocolate covered caramels.
Taste - Dark chocolate malt, dark chocolate mocha, light bitter nutty sweetness like skin-on almonds, vanilla dark chocolate covered sea-salt caramels, light oaky dryness at the end.
Finish - Long lingering dark chocolate covered caramel sweetness, nice sweet oak smokiness with a lightly drying mouthfeel.
Score - 92/100
Final Thoughts - I find this to be a very nicely balanced bourbon that in my opinion isn't overly oaked. They managed to find a nice balance in the second barreling that adds this nice toasted cocoa nib/dark chocolate flavor to the bourbon that makes this delicious and almost dessert-like. This is fantastic sipped neat or turned into a coffee/chocolate old fashioned or manhattan."

3.0,"Selected by Whiskey Down, MGM Grand Las Vegas. Smells of bananas and honey. Sharp on the tongue. Some sweetness, bananas again, fall spice, a bit of oak and vanilla. Spice and bitter chocolate linger. Zesty, but still smooth. 8/17/17"

4.25,"My county (Orange County, NC) received a store pick single barrel of this, so I had to pick it up despite the exorbitant price. The week prior I had purchased Jim Beam Double Oak and I could not pass up the opportunity to buy the clearly superior product. The only other time I've had Woodford Reserve Double Oaked was at the distillery. I remember enjoying it immensely, but I was also hammered by the time I got there. (Third distillery of the day, my friends and I killed a fifth between each distillery.)

Buttery oak is so prominent on the nose. Unlike Jim Beam's offering, this smells smooth and delicious and in no way artificial. I think of a caramel coffee bread pudding with a dash of oak, something you'll find at an upscale southern restaurant. If you've had a rich bread pudding then you'll know there are few desserts better suited to conclude a meal. I surprisingly had an amazing bread pudding at a brewery last month, the quality far outweighed the dinner. That bread pudding buttery oak is all over the tongue, and the syrupy quality is strong. It is sweet enough that you will probably get 2 drinks max out of this before you want to switch to something else. The oak and sweetness lingers, while the alcohol taste is minimal. Overall I would almost classify this as a dessert liqueur despite its abv, it's something to savor and enjoy. I think people who do not necessarily enjoy whiskey might like this since the sweetness dominates the alcohol."

4.5,"“Snickers” short and sweet description 
I got this bottle which was a store pick. Really Really Good!!!!"
3.5,"Noses very sweet and toffee, light vanilla, hits the palate with sweetness, a light burn followed by heavy oak and rounded cinnamon notes, the oak and spiciness keeps going and lingers. Very unique enhancement of the sweetness and  oakiness of the woodford profile."

2.5,"Bubbles KCMO store pick sample.  Glad I tried before I bought, there had been a lot of love for this bottle and I assumed I’d love it too.

Didn’t get full tasting notes, but was far more medicinal than expected, and dominated by wood char.  Did not get the overwhelming sweetness that others have mentioned.  Perhaps skewed by following a taste of a delightful but sweet finished rye.

I’ll need to try again, but for now not on my short list.  Also convinced me not to grab the Old Forester 1910 due to comparisons of the style."
