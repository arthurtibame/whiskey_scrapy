3.5,Wasn't expecting much peat from an Australian distillery where peat is non-existent and needs to be imported. The most slight of peat/smoke on the nose and palate. Tasted like a very mellowed subdued version of Laphroiag...
3.75,"Strong up front, with peat, but sweet syrup smell and taste comes through."

4.0,This one is really interesting. I should dislike this whiskey given its a lighter sweeter not full bodied dram. It had a really different profile though to a scots whiskey - very light but really carried flavour well. The alcohol was well balanced
