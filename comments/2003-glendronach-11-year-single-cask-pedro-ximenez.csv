5.0,"Rich, deep fruits, cooked with Christmas spices. There are coffee and chocolate notes too, with a slight hint of citrus. With time, the nose even gives tropical fruit. The palate is sweet, dark raisin, coating, and some darker spice. The finish is long, oaky, and drying. Every sip asks for another. I bought this when I didn't know enough about Scotch. It remains one of my greatest errors in whisky that I did not buy the shelf."

4.0,"Another excellent PX stuff from Glendronach. The nose is sooooo sherry - with grapes and raisins dominating, while the first sip gives you powerful sherry/chocolate/raisins bomb. It gets milder with more sips and leaves a good, aromatic finish with no alcohol burning."
