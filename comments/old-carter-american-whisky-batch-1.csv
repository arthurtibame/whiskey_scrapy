3.75,More rye than bourbon with lingering burn. Very spicy and peppery
3.5,"Said I was done till the weekend but this followed me home and I wanted to get some notes out early as possible on it.  Plus...I'm pretty excited.  Full disclosure, I have zero idea what this is beyond being whisky and 12 years old and 134.9 proof.  

Nose - One hell of an alcohol kick here.  Oh this is unique.  There's a grape/plum type fruit nose over good american oak, and I think some vanilla.  Water brings out that butter scotch note I get on the flavor profile.  it's still super fruity.  

Taste - Oh flavor is all butter scotch and then a fruity funky oak finish.  Oh man...this is special.  I'm getting a nice tobacco note (maybe because I smoked cigars this weekend I'm getting it), touch of leather, and i swear this note could be some kind of soda even, it's this fruity and vanilla.  Then I get some nutty notes.  

I'm really impressed with this.  Their rye (batch 2) is decent stuff, their bourbon (batch 2) was really nice but to me a touch young.  This is better than the other two. A lot better, but you really have to like this butter scotch and oak."
4.25,"Nose is all butterscotch, and really appealing. Palate has a lot of wood, is a bit drying, but really pleasant with a moderately long finish."
