4.75,"For the price of only $59 here in Raleigh nc, you can’t beat the complexity and flavors this bourbon offers!  Easily a top ten and a must buy when available.   Added this one to c917 and 2x b518"
3.25,"I am back to my wheelhouse and cracked this beauty tonight having picked it up a couple weeks back. Having been on an Irish and Japanese Whiskey tasting tour as of late it's nice to come back to classic well aged Kentucky Juice. 
I am a huge fan of this expression and have yet to be dissapionted. This is the first and only 2018 expression I have picked up as I still have the entire 2017 flight and 2 2016 bottles. I had stopped to ask myself at what point do I stop collecting this expression? Then the reality of a bottle starring me in the face for $62.99, asking me to dance one more time. Who am I to refuse such an exquisite partner??
As this one hits my lips any buyers remorse quickly dissapates. So viscous and mouth coating. Thick, creamy butterscotch, vanilla and burnt brown sugar. A slight spice swell with some oak and old leather leading to a long cigar tobacco and chocolate chip driven finish with an array of baking spices. 
Lovely Dram if somewhat out of balance. The spice notes swell on the finish and mid palatte that takes away from the experience. If you have yet to find a bottle of Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, it's still worthwhile. If you have experience with it, I'd seek out another batch. 
Cheers all!"
4.5,"Wow, just wow. 

This is my favorite ECBP release to date. 

Buy as many as you can find!"

5.0,"Best bourbon I have ever enjoyed. C918 is exceptional. At 131 proof it's certainly at hazmat levels, but it dangerously does not drink like a high proof bourbon. Adding a few drops of water or a small piece of ice releases an explosion of flavors. Outstanding.

Addendum: it is now 4 months later and I have half a bottle remaining of C918. It’s even better now, if that’s at all possible.  I now get sweet pipe tobacco on the palate, which reminds me of my grandpa who often smoked a pipe on his porch. This is what bourbon should be, provoking fond memories of days gone by."

5.0,A very good pour! Worth every penny! Big notes of butterscotch and wood on the nose and cherries and vanilla on the palate. Delicious

4.5,"Buttery, just let it sit on your tongue for few and you’ll know what I’m taking about.  Soooo good, a bit of butterscotch and caramel/ vanilla with a pleasant smooth spicy finish.  Wow my favorite so far....Very  smooth and just pleasant to drink,  like a Spice cake of some sort (but better).  Always loved the regular small batch, this takes it to a whole different level🤙🏼"
4.75,Really good. Maybe my favorite so far. Had a glass at the Whisky Bar.
4.75,"Phenomenal Bourbon! Nice big robust flavors. It certainly isn’t as hot as you would expect a 131 proof whiskey to be. Anytime I find this in stores from now on, I’m buying it."

4.25,Has a big yet smooth punch. So many flavors from start to finish. This is a must try for the Whiskey drinker like myself. Goes great with a cigar
4.75,"Oak, charcoal, burnt brown sugar, chocolate"
4.5,"Nose: vanilla and Carmel red apples not as much oak as normal bourbons 

Taste: Carmel and spice dominate. Some slight maple and honey. Some more wood than the nose with vanilla. 
Easy round finish. 

Excellent beginner bourbon or whiskey in general"

4.5,This is awesome. Super rich super buttery. Really good
3.75,Very strong tasting. Good sweet flavor to balance the burn though
4.25,"Fabulous. Tasted with a cigar, polish sausage and sauerkraut.

A little alcohol on the nose, as expected for a barrel strength bourbon, but very smooth drinking. It is good both neat, and on the rocks. Notes of caramel and plum up front, fading to leather and smoke.

One of my first “mid-range” bourbons, and quite a delight."

4.5,"Sweet maple and caramel, with very subtle oak and a lingering heat. Definitely burns, but not as much as I'd expect given the proof."
4.25,"Nose: brown sugar, molasses, cherry, rye towards licorice
Taste: can definitely feel the proof, rye, clove, caramel, oak
Finish: the rye note persists, salty, almost a minty fresh feeling with my tongue tingling from the alcohol 
After reading reviews: maple syrup on the nose makes some sense though to me it was darker like molasses, I didn’t really get the buttery note that Distiller focused on.  Overall, I’m hoping this opens up a bit as I work down the bottle (this was the neck pour)."
3.75,"0-1.5: Disgusting. Worth only mixing or meeting the drain. 
2: Bad. Wouldn’t feel bad mixing
2.5: Sub-par. OK, but bland or somewhat flawed. 
3: Good. Decent stuff, but not a top re-buy
3.5: Very good. I’d love to keep a bottle around
4: Excellent. A go to for me that is worthy of celebrating - will never get old
4.5: Incredible
5:Perfect and an all time favorite"

4.5,"Wow.  This one is as good as advertised.  I always taste a whiskey with a lot of hype around it with a certain amount of distrust but this one delivers in a big way!

Nose:  Not as much alcohol punch as I'd expect with the high proof.  The first smell that hit was salty peanut shells.  This immediately makes me think baseball games with my dad as a kid.  Also I'm getting toasted oak, toasted coconut, barrel spices like cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg, caramel, brown sugars, and vanilla.  A very complex nose that keeps developing the more I smell and sip.

Flavor:  Traditional bourbon flavors like vanilla, butter, and brown sugar but with the dial turned up to 11.  More salty peanuts and lots of barrel spices right up front along with some black pepper.  Not nearly as strong on the alcohol as I'd expect with the proof.  Buttery and oily in a great way.  It took a minute for me to put my finger on it but you know what this tasted like?  100% it's cracker jack.  I mean the caramel popcorn with salted coated peanuts.  Wow this is good.

Finish:  Long finish with drying oak, more toasted salty peanuts, and barrel spice.  This doesn't finish as sweet as the initial flavor suggested.

This was great.  Well worth the price.  It's always cool when a whiskey brings you back to a particular memory and this hits on all cylinders.  Well done Heaven Hill!"

4.75,"Floral nose with a caramel undertone. Smoother on the pallette than other batches but still a monster of a bourbon. Spicy but light with a quickly spiking burn. Lasting finish of brown sugar and mild rye and oak with some of the earlier flavors cycling through in good complexity. I squint and I can peel some mint out. This is everything a burbon should be, but probably too big for some."

4.25,"Neat.  Lovely nose.  Cinnamon and sugar mostly but a hint of floral behind it.  High proof hides itself on the nose.  Nice creamy texture where the cinnamon and spice rocks the tongue immediately.  Get some chocolate flavors initially but the high proof sweeps through and mutes everything for a bit.  After taste is fantastic.  Lots of vanilla, almost a pie crust taste to it.  Big fan.  I’ll add water next taste.  I feel like the high proof muted quite a bit."

4.0,Tasted this head to head verses B918. Not nearly the same quality. This one has quite a bit more burn. But overall still a quality whiskey well worth the price.
4.5,"Great candied sugar aroma, with burnt caramel, cotton candy, and a hint of brine.

Deep, layered flavors of oak, barrel char, vanilla, cinnamon, and leather. Butterscotch and dried candied dark fruits in the mid-palate. That hint of brine in the nose manifests itself as a salty peanut flavor just before the finish and lends a welcome funky note. Long, hot finish lasts for days. A real winner."

4.5,Soft and beautiful for a barrel proof. Amazing aroma and full mouth feel.
4.5,"Nose:
Intense
Syrup (brown rice)
Nutty
Dark Cherry
Hay or dustiness?

Palate:
Intense pepperiness on front of palate
Gives way to chocolate note I find in standard ECSmB
Finishes with a slightly tanniny oakiness on back of palate
Caramel
Brown sugar

A complete barrel proof selection, though extremely intense."

4.25,"Nose - surprisingly not a lot of heat, initially get a lot of light fruit - Juicy green apple, peer and cherries.  Get the oak char on the back end and maybe a hint of orange zest.  

Palate - medium but nice mouth feel.  Coating and drying but not over dry.  Get that initial fruity sweetness that quickly turns into a lot of vanilla and oak. Definitely hot but not too hot where you can’t sift through all the flavor.  

Finish - medium to long finish. Pepper and alspice. Get the good ole Kentucky hug at the end.  

Definitely one of my favorites."

4.0,"Batch: C918
Age: 12
Year: 2018
Proof: 131

Nose: toffee, biscuits, candied nuts 

Palate: rich with hints of baking spices, and vanilla

Finish: very smooth for the high proof. Probably the smoothest bourbon above 125 I’ve ever had. The only bite comes from the proof level and definitely not the recipe; this is a 10% rye mashbill. Slightly bitter at the end. 

Overall excellent."

4.5,"This is a delayed review. When I first opened this bottle, it was hot and spicy and not very flavorful. The finish was not great either. I had forgotten about it as I had other better drams to drink. 
After about a year I went back to it because everyone thought ECBF was so good. Did I miss something? 
Wow, did it ever open up into one of the best bourbons I've ever tasted. The nose was pleasant but not great. The plate however gave me a burst of flavour that I could not wrap my head around. Sweet, spicy, rich, viscous. It was intense! The finish was long and chewy-so different than the first tasting. 
What a bargain compared to other high proofs out there."
4.25,"Nose: sweet heath bar or toffee, some creme brûlée possibly. Not a lot of fruit, maybe hint of banana or strawberry angel food cake. 
Palate: so good. Sweet cinnamon bread, moderate length finish, not too spicy given the proof. Chocolate Rolos caramels, lots of different good variations. Arguably better, certainly more bold than Blanton’s."

5.0,"The best bourbon I've ever tasted. Heavy and strong, yet smooth and incredibly tasty. I taste caramel, butterscotch, brown sugar, toasted oak, pepper and cinnamon. The bourbon has a fantastic chewy finish."

4.25,"Opened 11/19

This is probab;y the best bang for your buck on the market. 12 year barrel proof whiskey for between $70-80. For being well over 130 proof, the ethanol is not in your face. No need for any added water."
4.0,"Wonderful nose. I get semi-sweet, deep, and rich notes. High heat on the back end, which is no surprise considering the proof. A few drops of water lessens the heat and lets the richness shine."
4.25,Leather. Honey. Toasted Marshmallow. Vanilla.
3.75,"N: Brown sugar, caramel
P: brown sugar, spice
F:  finishes into a dry oak

2nd pour from the bottle. Flavors still seem to be on top of each other for now. This should open up nicely. Still solid as is."
4.25,"Nose: maple syrup, butterscotch, candy corn, a little oak and hints of raisins and cherries

Palate: rich, vanilla spices, citrus and toffee

Finish: medium to full body... excellent balance of flavor and bite

This stands up to the E. H. Taylor Single Barrel in richness, drinkability and complexity. It will vary from release to release but this shows you how fantastic EC was at its old 12-year age statement before the bourbon boom."

4.5,"I can’t smell anything but alcohol at first approach to this massive, chunky bourbon. Then rich vanilla and brown sugar aromas sneak out as I drop water in to assuage the 67-odd % proof. It’s a deep bronze, leggy, inviting dram in the glass. 

Sipping is like being punched repeatedly in the mouth by a booze-soaked cinnamon bun. Each time it delivers spicy, rich sweetness with a fiery kick, even when well watered. This is benchmark bourbon, no holds barred."
