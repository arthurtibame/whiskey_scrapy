4.0,"My new favorite ECBP? Lets see

Nose - This nose is just perfect bourbon. There's both nutty, caramel, vanilla, rich oak, and it's all so integrated that it just smells like rich dark sweet bourbon. OK it's a bit on the nutty side and a bit lacking in depth for the elite elite bourbons but still wow good.

Taste - what really makes the 520 special is that neat it drinks so insanely well. C919 was insanely good but it was dry and astringent and needed about 3-6 drops of water to fix that and once it did well WOW. This doesn't need it at all. It's almost perfect neat. It's this sweet mellow oaked goodness giving us just a perfect baked pie and oaked smoked vanilla and hints of chocolate. There might be a roasted almond or walnut or something like that as well. yeah vanilla roasted almonds are here. But with water, things get even more dessert and creamy. There's still oak spice and the power of this one doesn't get questioned with a drop or 10. More water just leaves an oak and vanilla that was made for bourbon lovers. 

ECBP remains the quintessential definition of bourbon.  It is what bourbon is supposed to be. You water this down to 90 proof and you get the age and perfect balance. You drink it neat and you get to enjoy the intense blow you away proof without it being off putting. B520 is perhaps the most ""perfect"" of these examples in that it simply has no flaws that aren't baked into the ECBP formula. If you like ECBP, this is great. if you've had some you didn't like, well this is the perfect balance. 

Bottom line a very RARE 4.0 for a sub 100 dollar bottle. I think I paid 140 for 2 bottles before tax. Money WELL spent."
4.25,Good balance strong and smooth

4.5,"So rich and full of character, one of the best cask strengths I’ve tasted. It brings the heat but it’s amazing with a big cube of ice. If you see it, it’s a must buy."
4.75,"wow, just wow!  Absolutely the best ECBP batch I've had.  I have B519, C919, A120 and now B520.  I have not done a side by side yet, but, right away I can tell this batch is the one to beat.  

Nose is rich and hints at chocolate and baking spices.  Lower proof on this batch makes deep nosing possible, the C919 and A120 are almost too strong to get your nose into.

Taste is....fantastic! Dark chocolate, cinnamon syrup, thick oily mouth feel coats the tongue, and the lower proof requires no water to enjoy.  I love high proof whisk(e)y, and this one still hits the mark without hitting your mouth and chest too hot.

Finish is not as long as some other ECBP, mostly because the proof does not roast your insides.  Still, having had only a small neck pour thus far, I am still remembering the pour 10 min later.

Def one to buy, hell, based on the hype, i bought 3 without trying and have NO REGRETS.  

Cheers."

4.75,great robust nose.taste is full bodied and mouth the finish is long and mellow..highly recommended..this baby will go fast.
4.75,"Caramel and vanilla on nose and pallet. A little brown sugar coconut on the nose. Mouth feel is outstanding. Syrupy. A little spicy, warming, but not as hot as expected. I get a lot more burn on the finish from lower proof Old Forester 1920."

4.5,"Preferred this with a few drops of water. Marshmallow starts you off, followed by caramel/molasses, and then rye spice. Strong tingle on the tongue, and oak and leather come back onto the palate along with vanilla. Long finish. Excellent pour."
4.25,Great nose. Super hot

4.75,"Neat. Neck pour. Initial impression is subtle but super rich on the nose.  It is not in your face like ECBP can be but it is jammed with flavor.  Nuttiness and oak hit me first, toasted coconut maybe.  An amazing cherry note surrounded by vanilla.  Hint of banana bread.  This is really really good.

Geez this is good.  Super creamy but not viscous or syrupy as some ECBP.  Flavors for miles and intense.  There is a cherry note here so sweet it hurts.  The initial hit on the tongue is surprising.  It’s citrus and orange and once you swallow it is an uppercut if cherry, vanilla, chocolate, oak, tobacco, hint of leather.  Around the flavor wheel we go, over and over and over.  Legs don’t stop.

This is nuts.  I’ll regret it in the morning but this deserves a side by side with C919...

Holy shit it crushes it.  This needs more side by sides but B520 may be the Batch 12 of ECBP.  Wow."
