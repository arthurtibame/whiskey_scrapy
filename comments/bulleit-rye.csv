4.0,Very solid Rye Whiskey.  A touch of spice.  Affordable.
4.0,"Nose is a combination of sweet notes mixed with rye spice. First sip is sweet, with notes of caramel. Finish is a quick flash of rye spice and a moderate linger that is just a little sweet. Hard to identify some of the notes individually but the overall taste is great. The mouthfeel is excellent, especially on the rocks, though it does mellow out a little too much on the rocks for my liking. Overall, this is an excellent rye for the price, better than the more expensive Templeton 4 year and only marginally inferior to the almost twice as expensive Templeton 6 year."
3.75,"Nose: very bold spice with some apricot and a bit of fruity sweetness, maybe banana.
Palate: pronounce herbal medicinal-like notes with a mild sweet  liqueur finish. 

Sharp texture that bites the mouth and fills it. 

My first Rye and I like it. It's an interesting twist from the usual Scotch whisky."

3.0,"Nose: Quite a strong aroma, really perfumey and herbal. Rye, tobacco, dill, honey, oak, and peaches are the main notes. Other notes include varnish, raspberries, and a citrus peel.

Taste: Much like the aroma, although I can taste some smoke and different spices.

Finish: Slight burn but altogether has a very strong (if not overwhelming) body from the florescence and perfume. Turns tart on the palette."

3.5,"One of the most dependable and reliable ryes out there, in my opinion and it's priced right.  Good enough to drink neat on a weeknight, cheap enough to put in a cocktail.  It has a pleasant rye flavor, with a bit of wood, and vanilla.  It's got a bit of an herbal and grassy edge with the rye spice."

2.75,"This tastes quite similar to the standard Bulleit Bourbon, but with the sweet corn notes swapped with eucalyptus and funky tropical fruit. It's in an awkward spot between rye and bourbon, and tastes very odd as a mixer. I'd pass on this unless you're a diehard rye fan."

2.75,"Before I got into whiskey I often ordered cheap rye on the rocks at bars, so I figured I enjoyed rye whiskey. However, now I realize the ryes I drank were lower rye content. I have never had a 95% rye until now and I haven't enjoyed drinking it neat so it's taken me a while to finish this bottle. I've mostly used it for amateur cocktails at home, which is a good use of this rye.

The nose is very strong. I don't know if it's tobacco like the expert review states, it smells more herbal and perfumey. It is similar to scented candles I like, but that's not a smell I want in a whiskey. I guess that may be what everyone describes as eucalyptus or cloves, but for me it is a combination of many air freshener and cleaner type scents. I get more pine sap on the taste, with hints of pepper and cinnamon. It lacks sweetness on the taste and finish. If you told me I was drinking Pine Sol I would find it hard to disagree with you. The only reason I'm rating this as a 2.75 is it works really well in cocktails, but then again, cheaper ryes than this also work well in cocktails. If you don't like really strong rye, don't buy this."

3.25,"Bulleit Rye 95
Picked up my first bottle of this in ages on a whim recently and just realized I've never officially reviewed it. 
NOSE: Pours into the Glencairn a Light Auburn Color and yields notes of Rye Bread, Dill, Mint, Fresh Varnish, Mustard Seed, and a Hoppy IPA. Savory and Slightly Hot.
NEAT : Black Pepper, Rye, Dill, Light Vanilla, Young Oak, Grapefruit Peel, and Bitter Hops. Leaves a tingly coating of Bitter Hops and Mild Vanilla.
SPLASH: Takes the heat off the nose and adds a little sweetness. Adds sweetness to the palate as well, but it is at the expense of some of more complex notes I was getting Neat.
VERDICT: Despite it's $35 price tag, to me this is not designed to be a Sippin' Rye. That mantle is best reserved for Ryes such as Rittenhouse, Pikesville, or one of High West's offerings. The reason this one earns a spot on the bar is it's prowess in Cocktails. Makes great Old Fashioneds, Manhattans, and Highballs. That spicy rye really punches through. 3.5"
3.0,"Appearance: The appearance of this popular rye is a russet/caramel color with thin oily legs.

Nose: The nose is quite interesting with notes of eucalyptus, malty stout beer, honey, fruity cherry and peach, sweet caramel and vanilla, and also black pepper and coconut.

Taste: Compared to the nose there’s not much taste. Barrel spice, rye bread, smoke like aromatic pipe smoke, and sour raspberry notes are some I could identify.

Finish: The finish starts with a mild burning that transitions into a tart lemon-like note.

Thoughts: This is a good rye that does its category justice; it’s not the best there is, but for the price and the honest proof, it is nothing to be ashamed of. I am curious to try the new 12 year old rye from Bulleit too and hope that one to be exceptional. Thanks, Bulleit! Cheers!"

3.0,Ok finally bit the bulleit(sorry) and got this. Im familiar with the mash as its very common in the rye world(Thanks MGP). Im not gonna go all in on tasting notes as past reviews have that covered. This is a tasty rye with nice balance and its very enjoyable. For the money its a good buy and I recommend . What I will add though is this is without a doubt the same juice and flavor profile as James Pepper Barrel proof that I so heavily lauded. Yes the JPBF is superior but the Bulleit is no slouch. Bottom line is if you are a fan of this rye than seek out the JP if you can find it. Same situation as Rittenhouse vs Pikesville. As for Bulleit........80/100........a solid rye whiskey and strong value

You get up in the morning to go to work on a Monday morning. It’s early, and you’re groggy. You get ready and go to your car. You stick the key in the ignition and the radio was left on a random station at full volume. You have no idea what song is playing and it’s entirely too loud. 

That is the feeling I get when I drink this. Pickle juice and pine dominate the nose and early palate. Mint and hot white pepper hits you quickly over the head. The sweetness and vanilla seem chemical and fake. A tinge of alcohol and pepper is all you’re left with on the short mineral tart finish. 

You instinctively reach down and slap the radio off as fast as you can. Everything is better now, but you’re in a slightly worse mood. Same for this dram. Maybe I just don’t have my rye senses yet, but wow this is hot and unharmonious.  No thank you."

The sweetness and spiciness balance each other very well. The color is a rich amber. When I have made an Old Fashioned or a Manhattan it is just right. When I first began drinking Rye whiskey's I preferred Jack Daniels and Wild Turkey and Bulleit was the strong Rye.

If you like their bourbon, you will probably like this as well. Amazing how even though the mash bill is wildly different there is a profile here that is distinctly Bulleit. Maybe that’s positive feedback for MGP too.

2.75,"Nose: Spicy with hints of pepper and black licorice. Light vanilla.

Taste: Spicy with black pepper. Black licorice (hint). Slightly sweet but prickly or ""spikey"" on the tongue. Has a bite even for a low proof. Not bad, but pretty basic."
4.0,"A spicy high proof rye whiskey best for cocktails. While serving neat the aromas are vivid with notes of star anise and coriander. On the palette it tastes sweet and spicy with hint of honey, caramel, cumin and a tinge of capsaicin. However there is predominant acetone vapor, which is bit off putting. But otherwise a good budget tasty whisky. Cheers!"

Better ryes out there."

3.75,Slightly high rating but it’s so solid and affordable. My go to. A little bite and soft on the tongue. Great with or without ice. But I prefer one cube (or two depending on the pour)

4.25,Mint freshness and green woods jumped out. Followed by richer cedar and earthy oils.  Really nice.
4.0,Another great old fashion rye. Lots of spice throughout but enough vanilla and sweet to combat the spice. I like it

4.0,Nose and taste are all clean& spicy with eucalyptus and cherry vanilla. Finish is light and menthol herbs. This is my first adventure into rye from Scotch and I was happy with it.

3.0,Sweet at first then very spicy with a dry slightly sour  finish. As with most ryes I've tried I just can't really get into it.

4.0,"This is definitely just my associative memory of Manhattans getting out of hand but I’m really smelling and tasting the vermouth. I started the notice a second note and it was just cocktail cherry, so my experience of this whiskey is definitely not credible. I get most of the rye spice on the finish."
3.5,This brand is my go to

2.25,"This is not a rich drink. It's kind of weak with some spice and mild fruit. It's a bit like Stein's rye. The backing is very generic without being actively bad. There's some spicy harshness and it's quite strong relative to the rest of the whiskey. There's a lot of tartness and the flavor is clean. There's some cinnamon and green apple, with the latter leaving a surprisingly clean finish. The alcohol blends well with the tartness, making this surprisingly almost sippable. When you get a big swig though, the coarseness and lack of subtlety become more apparent. The sweetness comes out a bit too then, but it's kind of a punch in the face at that point. There's some smoke that blends well, but it isn't too crazy. It's very generic rye and for a cheap price that's OK."
3.75,"Very full, has a good finish, tastes pepper and corn flavors are very present in this"
