5.0,"Had this at a drammers club event celebrating robin Robinson’s new book and it was amazing. This was distilled in 1985, so it contains distillate before sazerac/buffalo trace bought Eagle Rare in 1989. This stuff is full of flavor with notes of Vanilla, Caramel, Cherry, Floral notes, White Chocolate, Pepper, Citrus, cotton candy , corn, oak, and dark chocolate."
