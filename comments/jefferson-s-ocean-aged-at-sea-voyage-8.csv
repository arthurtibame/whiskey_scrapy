2.0,"This review is for Voyage 9.  I rolled my eyes at the concept of this bourbon but kept an open mind.  This bourbon is aged for 6 years or so then put on ships that sail around the world, purportedly so the exposure to different types of air and the rocking motion of the ship produce interesting effects on this whiskey.  In actuality, this is a disappointment.  The nose is light and leads with a fair amount of ethanol before transitioning to fruity, sweet, and floral flavors, with some oakiness.  The palate is watery, thin, and astringent, with a soapy quality obscuring what seems to be a very sweet, simple syrup palate.  The finish all of a sudden manifests a dollop of rye spice and herbs, maybe the most rye-dominant aftertaste I've had in a bourbon.  Overall, Jefferson's feels a little young and, at $80, is not a good value."

3.0,"I can't tell what sticks out on the nose. I guess it's brine and I think some apple, vanilla and oak but not too much. Medium finish. Not too harsh. Good stuff. Good enough to be proud to share with anyone but not so good I would only bring it out for other enthusiasts."
5.0,"One of my favorites - I like this better than any of the Jefferson line I’ve had. Possibly the smoothest bourbon I’ve had. This is light, floral and best served neat."

It is to the point where I’d say this should only be a mixer, but that is obviously far too cost prohibitive.in short, I’d avoid buying this again."
