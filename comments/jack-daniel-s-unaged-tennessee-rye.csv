1.0,"While perusing my local catch-all emporium (Costco) this squat, precocious little bottle caught mine eye.  Though hesitant to put forth forty-five dollars for a Brown-Forman product (I’ve been burned before. I’m looking at you, double-oaked) I bit the bulleit and readily placed it in my cart next to my non-gmo vegetables, organic hummus, and shop-vac. Upon returning home I excitedly popped the cork and aggressively shoved my nose over the mouth of the bottle.  Inhaling enthusiastically, I began to choke and sputter.  I put the bottle down and took a step back, eyeing it suspiciously.  After regaining composure, I assured myself it was simply the nose of an un-aged rye, nothing to fear, really.  Arms extended, I gingerly poured myself a glass.  Nodding to myself confidently I, breathing through my mouth, took a sip.  Now I wish I could report that the taste had some redeeming qualities, something to make up for the assaulting and abrasive scent, but I can’t.  I will say, however, that shop-vacs are excellent at getting non-Newtonian fluids out of carpet."

null,"It's interesting to have in my collection as a conversation piece. I personally don't care for it. This is very strange, I have no experience with any other unaged rye. This is like Brewers yeast. Takes me back to the still house at Lynchburg.  I have yet to find a redeeming flavor anywhere in this bottle, and I'm done searching. Unfortunately, I bought two bottles because I thought it was going to be limited & hard to fine. So naive I was."
