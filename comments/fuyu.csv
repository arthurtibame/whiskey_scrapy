4.0,If I was given this in a blind tasting I would have definitely guessed that it was a bourbon. Very sweet but otherwise easy to drink. Not the most complex whisky out there (especially for Japanese) but not a bad drink by any means. I was expecting more peat but there was hardly any at all

3.0,Intéressant mais trop fruité. Couleur pâle. Trop jeune à mon goût
