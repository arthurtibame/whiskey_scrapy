5.0,"Wow, so much flavor and so smooth for 116 proof.  Just one big block cube of ice and i can sip on this one for a long time.  I really love this whiskey, and i can't believe it was only $40.00.  Great value.  It say's on the label it was made with Passion and Purpose.  The way all whiskey should be in my opinion.  I don't think you can go wrong with this one."

3.75,Oak forward but hints of semi-sweet chocolate. High proof hits on the finish with pepper notes and cinnamon.

4.0,"I know the approach here is unorthodox but this is undeniably good juice.   Sherry is strong, it’s hot but smooth, creamy mouthfeel.  Well done."
