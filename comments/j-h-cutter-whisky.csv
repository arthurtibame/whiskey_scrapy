2.25,"Orange peel and dried apricot dominate on the nose. Somewhat bitter spice of clove/allspice on the palate and feels pretty thin and weak throughout. Never would have guessed an abv over 40. 
Tries to swing big, but lacks the complexity a great whisky needs."
3.5,"Note: Apricot, raisin, fruit, reminds me of gummy peach rings 
Taste: Similarly very fruity and apricot, caramel
Finish: Nothing special"

3.0,"First sip: I LOVE IT! All the stuff I love about both the hotaling rye and willet distillate. And then...
Second sip: died pretty quickly. This description from the review that “the circus was barely in town” is pretty spot on.
Third sip: okay, okay, I like it. I like the chaotic flavor profile because I like Potrero and I like Willet. It burns off pretty quickly on the back end, but if I was feeling excited and saw this bottle at a decent price (@ $40 tops) then I’d go for it... maybe."
2.0,"Chaos is a good description.  If you like Old Potrero, you will like this.  If you don't like Old Potrero, you aren't going to like this.  The one recurring adjective that comes to my mind when tasting this, or any other Potrero is: young.  It has that young, unaged, unrefined whiskey taste, especially on the finish."
