4.5,"This bourbon is rich, creamy, and it reminds me of Saturday morning. I get heavy cereal influence throughout the taste, starting with buttered pancake drizzled with maple syrup on the nose. The caramel underbelly characteristic of many bourbons is present here, but the rich mouthfeel makes it unique, and the high proof brings it to another level. The finish has a bit of hard candy and residual heat and lasts a good while."
