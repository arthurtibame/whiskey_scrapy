4.0,"It is a very sweet and smooth whiskey, very easy to drink. The sweet taste of fruits somewhat over powers the blend to lessen a good whiskey. While it is worthy of trying, I think I would rather skip paying for the bottle though."
4.0,Best Canadian whiskey I've had. Honestly didn't know what it was when I got it as a wedding gift from a friend. Sweet and smooth. This is a dessert whiskey if I've ever had one.

3.0,"Surprisingly rich on the nose, with creamy vanilla, lavender, and wood spice. After a while, some soap and maybe white grapes. Smooth on the palate, the creaminess carries over. Thick mouthfeel, sweetness balanced with spice, with an unexpected warmth going down. Shows more complexity after additional sips, with acidic fruit. The spice lingers. This is a pleasant, solid pour. Too bad it's been discontinued. 8/11/18"

4.0,"I should note that I'm not a fan of cognac but I received this bottle as a gift.  Over the course of a two week period I paired the beverage with food, alone, snacks.  I really felt that this flavor was great when it with something else.  It and an ice cube.  It and a meal.  It and a snack.  On its own, I did not feel that it was anything over the top and worth the price tag it originally had.  The flavor wasn't off putting (aside from the cognac but as I said, not a fan of that, so I'm not including that in my review).

In other words, it wasn't like I'd throw a bottle out but these sell for silly money on the secondary.  I wouldn't buy it for that.  If I could find it for normal prices, I probably would."
