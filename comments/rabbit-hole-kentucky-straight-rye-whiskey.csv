2.0,Not a fan. I have had much better Rye whiskey especially at the price point.
3.0,"Batch 1 bottle 2440.  Solid pour.  Relatively smooth for a 2 year old whiskey.  Can't wait to see what they come out with in a few years, after it has aged a little more"

3.0,Not that interesting or complex. A little medicinal. Better with ice.
null,Just tried their Gin.... nice job
4.0,The rye definitely comes through but unlike most rye whiskies it isn't necessarily hot on the finish. Very smooth and could be a steal depending on the price where you find it

4.0,"Good spicy finish.  Cloves and honey, maybe some cinnamon. Not overly complex but what it does it does well. Solid choice but not overly exciting for the price."

3.75,Very light rye taste with little lived finish.
4.5,"That's a spicy meatball. Barrel age is heavy, and the rye is spicy, yet clean. There might be some floral citrus hiding in the back."

3.75,"Kaveh Zamanian said when he was thinking and dreaming about building a distillery and starting a brand, his wife would tell him ""you're taking the family down the rabbit hole.""
So when his dream became a reality, Zamanian easily came up with the name -- Rabbit Hole.

I first tried Rabbit Hole bourbon last year and immediately loved it. It has all the classic bourbon flavors and not really anything negative about it. This rye whiskey follows that lead. This is not a “barely legal” rye. This bad boy has 95% rye and 5% malted barley in the mashbill. This is the same mashbill as Bulliet 95 rye but this whiskey blows Bulliet away in terms of flavor. 

Rabbit Hole Rye is bottled at 47.5% ABV. It doesn’t carry an age statement other than to say it’s “matured over 2 years”. It’s a nice medium amber in the glass. It sticks to the glass with a thick oily coating and leaves slow legs after giving it a spin or two. According to the bottle this is from batch #3.

The nose is pretty much everything you’d expect from a rye: spicy with cinnamon and cloves, pumpernickel bread. Faint notes of brown sugar and molasses. This carries through to the palate with dark honey, cinnamon and cloves. A little one dimensional but very good. 

The finish on this is excellent. It’s decently long with more of that spicy profile: lots of black pepper and cinnamon, with oak char, molasses, leather, and tobacco. 

This was $50 at my local Kroger, about the same as their bourbon. For that price this is a decent value. This is a very good whiskey that belies it’s young age. Someone at Rabbit Hole knows what they’re doing. I look forward to seeing what they come up with in a few years when they have some more aged stock to work with. 3.75/5. Cheers!"
3.25,I am not very experienced in rye but this seemed pretty flat. It was certainly smooth and easy to drink at 95 proof but did not have much spice. I liked it but would not buy it again unless they were to age it longer.
3.0,"Spice, I dunno"
3.75,Smoother than I thought it would be. Good with a little bit of water or an ice cube.

5.0,It's like the Bulleit Rye without all the weird notes plus the richness of Sazerac. What a fantastic Rye.

3.0,Mild for a rye. Smooth but full of flavor. Can taste the rye and a hint of Caramel. Look forward to more from RH as the distillery gets older

2.0,Drinks like a 2yr whiskey. A lot of ethanol on the nose and palate. A sweet grain and Honey comes through on the nose. The flavor is pretty straight forward with out much depth. I think it's masked by the ethanol. Give this another 4 years and bottle above 100 proof and they may have a real winner.
4.0,Solid smooth rye with an eclectic bottling to boot. A good choice for something new if you can find it in your area.

3.75,Sweet smell but a bit boring. Not a whole bunch of character
3.75,"Nose: caramel, cinnamon, cloves, molasses 
Taste: nice rye spice, some molasses on the back of the tongue, and black pepper 
Finish: honey sweet with a slight burn on the tongue, finishes smooth 

Old fashioned: the spice of the rye lends itself perfectly to an old fashioned. Very good"
