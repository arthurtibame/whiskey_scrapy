4.25,"The third of a special series of mistery expressions of The Glenlivet, ""Enigma"" follows the ""Cipher"" and ""Code"" to deliver a fun, interactive way to enjoy your whisky and test your skills as a taster. 

This time, the Glenlivet wants you to find the tasting and aroma notes by completing a crossword in their website. Not one of the words you have to guess have anything to do with whisky, but it is very entertaining. You will have to fill 3 crosswords and the difficulty will get higher on each level. If you manage to complete the crossword, a tasting note will appear. Actually it only says:Apple; Spicy and Liquorice. 

Well, the ""Code"" experience was far better but i got to say this one is good enough to propose something different when enjoying a dram. 

Bottled at.... 60.6%abv! This is great! 

On the nose: right away i got tropical fruits, specially Pineapple. Apples, Sider, Cinnamon, Ginger and Pepper. Impalpable sugar, Vainilla. Nice aroma, very tropical.

On the palate, Pineapple, Apples; Super spicy but pleasant. Brown sugar and Apricots. 

Aftertaste is very balanced and good. It first feels like eating the heart of the pineapple. Pepper, Ginger, Wasabi.
Very pleasant. Liquorice. 

Overall this is a very good dram with some highlights to talk about: 1.- it has no alcohol note AT ALL, amazing thing since it has 60.6%abv; and, 2.- the three notes from the crossroads are easy distinguishable but this whisky is far more complex than just those three notes. My score for it is 89 over 100."

4.0,Needs some ice and some time to open. The bottle I have is over 60% - cask strength.
2.0,Severe burn. Light honey flavor. Not good. The 12 year is better. No need to try.
1.75,Disappointing - water helps but still rough / will try again after the bottles been open a bit but hard for me to appreciate this one

1.75,"This one is pretty rough. My bottle says 60.6%. There is a little bit of strawberry, some vanilla, and a lot of spice. Tastes more like flavored vodka than single malt Scotch. Hopefully it will settle down in a few months."
