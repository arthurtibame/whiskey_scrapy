3.0,"Have to keep this in perspective based on its low price. Pretty smooth, if not a bit lacking on flavor. What flavor it does have is a bit of vanilla. No spice, so any burn comes from the immaturity, but it is plenty manageable. No problem with having a bottle on the shelf for an easy drink without much thought."
4.0,A smooth bourbon with rich anise and vanilla flavors. I agree with another reviewer - a great nightcap whiskey.

0.75,"Dry sawdust notes, very light bourbon flavors. It's important to keep in mind that TerrePURE purposely filters out most of the congeners in their whiskeys. Oddly enough, this simply leaves Winchester with a slight barrel characteristic and a lot of ethanol on the finish. Tastes like Blanton"
0.75,"Alcohol, sawdust, and cinnamon aroma with some green apple notes. Cinnamon and apple flavor with some sawdust notes. A bit of a harsh finish. Pretty bad."

2.5,"Not much there, perfectly fine for mixing or cooking, but probably not worth drinking straight."
1.0,"Nose- Astringent young corn notes with vanilla and plum.
Body- Very sweet and light bodied with orange. Unfortunately these pleasant notes are overshadowed by unpleasant grain bitterness.
Finish- Fresh cut grass and a hint of black pepper on the end."

1.0,"Seriously, its like you took wood, milled it up and aged it in a gasoline barrel. Strained the chunky bits and put it in a bottle. Had 4 guys in Vegas and we decided to stay sober than drink it."
