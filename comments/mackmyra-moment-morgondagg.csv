3.75,"Nose: vanilla, caramel, fresh oak, citrus fruits, hint of pear.

Palate: Citric sweet, light but spicy

Finish: An explosion of fresh oak and spices welcomes you and ends in a short to medium, sour-sweet finish.

Water: A few drops intensifies the explosion and gives an oily but pleasant finish."
