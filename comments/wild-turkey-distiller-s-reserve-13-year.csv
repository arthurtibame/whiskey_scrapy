4.0,"Nose- Floral wildflowers, rich caramel, spiced oak, maple syrup, vanilla bean

Palate- Wave of baking spices initially, followed by notes of charred oak, black pepper, caramel, nutmeg, and a hint of maple syrup

Finish- medium, spicy finish with notes of charred oak, baking spices, and black pepper


What a nose. Beautiful mingling of herbal, sweetness, and aged oak. Unfortunately, that is the whiskies most shining moment. The palate is average, with an emphasis and spices and black pepper. A bit of maple syrup sweetness comes though, as well as charred oak, but spice dominates the initial sip and finish."

4.5,"What an absolute gem and such a shame to finish. Despite having the lower proof this dram stood up to Neat, few drops of water or even an ice chip. This had blended nose of clove, pepper, floral and leather but also vanilla/caramel. It had a round, creamy mouthfeel and flavors similar to aroma but add in baking spice and barrel spice. Finish is moderately long. Hate to see this one go."

3.75,"Mild nose, not surprising given the proof,  soapy almost. Opens up after a minute. On the palate, this is definitely one for the Japanese market, it's mild but still complex. Some floral notes, slight spice, long finish. Smooth yet flavorful, almost like a watered down Master's Keep 17. Would love to taste this at barrel proof. 11/8/19"
3.75,"Nose - pleasantly floral and sweet

Palate - oily, baking spices, cinnamon

Finish - light and sweet, smooth

Another solid turkey product"

4.0,Pretty tasty. Nicely balanced. Needs further investigation. I'll have to crack open my bottle again soon.

4.5,"Excellent Wild Turkey high-rye bourbon that noses like a rye and tastes like a caramel bomb. Rye comes back on the finish and the entire experience is rich, complex, and leaves you wanting more. The low ABV might hold back the finish slightly but improves the nose, which I'll take in this case. Try it!"

5.0,"Nose - Rich cinnamon, oaky caramel/toffee, toasted vanilla sugar.

Taste - Oily, spicy cinnamon, light oaky vanilla, dark caramel/toffee, toasted brulee crust, dark chocolate, light dark cherry sweet.

Finish - Lasting cinnamon tingle, light oaky caramel/toffee, dark chocolate, lightly tannic, light dark cherry sweet at end.

Score - 92/100

Final Thoughts - This is quite an incredible bourbon. Not overly complex, but what is there is amazingly well balanced and quite tasty. Zero off-putting notes, great nose, oaky but not super tannic/dryingly so.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes

Would I buy a bottle? - Yes"
