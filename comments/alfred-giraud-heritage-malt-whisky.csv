4.25,Very enjoyable and essy drinking. The Cognac are present and gives a good finish
5.0,Its beautiful and delicate but still bold and full of layers. Its like a Japanese whisky. The Giraud family were cellar and wood masters for Remy Martin and they brought all their blending knowledge to this exquisite bottle. Hard to find. Worth every penny.
