3.75,"Hint of vanilla and smoke, slightly harsh finish."
2.0,"Tasted at room temperature / Norlan glass / no water or ice added.   

Batch 03. 88 proof.   

The nose is alcohol, leather, and oak... Maybe the slightest hint of vanilla too.  So far, it's screaming ""youth"" to me.  

On the palate this befuddles me.  I was so expecting a young, hot whiskey that I was very surprised by the less than expected burn.  It's not mature, and it needs more time in the barrel, but the palate is a pleasing mix of holiday spices, especially cinnamon, a bit of citrus zest, and a touch of caramel.  It's still drinks more like a 110 proof than a 90, but this exceeded expectations.

The finish is medium to long, leaving a orange peel and cinnamon notes lingering.

Not a whiskey I'd buy again until they get more age behind it, but it's on the right track and exceeded my (exceedingly low) expectations."
3.75,Muted aroma of vanilla with a slight initial sweetness mellows out and ends with a slight rasp.

1.75,"Color: Straw, Gold
Aroma: Rubbing alcohol, grass
Mouth Feel: Thin, Dry
Flavor: Rubbing alcohol, Grass, Slightly Buttery
Finish: Short and Dry with a little bit of spice
Overall: A simple light and dry bourbon, slightly more whiskey than bourbon for my preference but not bad for the price. Sipped neat and then in an ice ball. May be a decent mixer bourbon. Not bad to try but I may be limited to one or two bottles in my lifetime."
