3.5,"Batch 7 

A little smoother than Batch 6. Amber appearance. Sweet on the nose. Prominent maple early on the palate. Sweetness slowly fades, timber lingers. A little water or ice opens it up, but don’t dilute too much."

3.5,"Batch 6 (46.5% abv)

Definitely a more mature and full bodied whiskey when compared to earlier batches.  A gentle and soft lingering sweetness."

5.0,"Same here, no pro. But a nice sipper for such a young whiskey. I got the lot 4 batch. Smells are sweet like sugar, lightly caramel to the taste. Gets better near the end of the glass. All of Vikre’s spirits I enjoy, not surprised they made a great whiskey."
