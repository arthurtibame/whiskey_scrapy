1.0,"Nose: A rubbery sherry note and some generic barley malt sugars. Pedestrian grain whisky and a little average malt, aged in mediocre multi-refill casks.

Palate: The arrival starts off promisingly with hints of sweet cereal and mild fruitiness. However these expectations are dashed as the spirit almost immediately fractures into a confusion of hard, spirity, bitter flavours with an overtone of burnt wood and a thin texture.

Finish: Thankfully short. A hot/bitter/sour tannic aftertaste.

Inadequate for neat sipping and suitable only for drinking with a mixer over ice - and even with cola the hard bitter tannins still show through. This bottling replaced the old Family Reserve but apart from the livery it is exactly the same.

Poor value and best avoided - there are several superior blended whiskies available at less cost.

""Inferior"" : 1 star."

2.75,"For a cheap scotch, it’s not bad but not great however. It’s a touch peaty and buttery but not overly complex. Again, this leans more toward whiskey than scotch. This is essentially the Evan Williams of scotch, good for the price but not much else."

4.0,Very light-- not heavy and oily like the Grant's Family Reserve. Some plum or raisin with a hint of vanilla. I really like it for the $15 USD.

1.0,"Nose is off — over-yeasty homemade bread that didn’t go as planned. Musty. Flavors on the tongue are less offensive, but there’s an aggressive harshness (as you might expect). Otherwise, you get that uncomplicated buttery sweetness so typical to low-price blends."

2.5,"Tasted neat. On the nose it smells like a young spirit but nothing offensive. I get some red apple with the slightest hints of smoke. 

The palate is really light, some more apple a bit of vanilla and some pepper rounds it up. 

The finish is short and nothing remarkable but I would not turn it away if offered to me. 

I bought this bottle for 11.99 to make one of my favorite whiskey cocktails. I will mix this with some natural coconut water over ice. This is how I learned to drink scotch as a teenager back in my home land of Puerto Rico. With weather being so warm year round my people always have this refreshing cocktail on standby. 

Salud!"
