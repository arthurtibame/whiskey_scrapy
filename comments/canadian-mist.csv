1.0,"Not good. Weird, artificial taste that can't quite be placed. Imitation maple syrup, maybe? Cloyingly sweet, it overwhelms anything I've put it in. Not even coke or ginger ale can redeem this stuff. There are much better $10 Canadian bottles out there."

1.0,"Nose - indistinct sweetness, stale peanuts (maybe just the shells), acetone, moderate ethanol burn. 

Taste - corn, sickening bland sweetness, slight barrel note, finishing disgustingly in every way.

Terrible, but giving it a 1.0 because at least it contains alcohol."

1.0,"First attempt at Review.  Pretty bland.  A little sweet, but with a terrible finish.  Not even any good in Coke."

3.0,"It's cheap, and it's canadian. Which means it's simple (cheap) and pretty dang smooth (canadian). It's nothing to get excited about, but has nothing to really offend either. Brief sweetness and a tiny bit of spice on a short finish. It surely won't kill you, throw in some ice and watch a hockey game, it won't mind not having all of your attention."

3.0,I found this to be surprisingly smooth and good. It is good for mixing but I also found myself drinking it neat. I didn't expect something so inexpensive to taste so smooth.

3.0,Nice rye. Hay finish. Reminds me of my grand father’s farm.

2.0,It’s a cheap whiskey made to be masked with soda.  When I’m going to drink like a fish.  Nothing special.

2.0,"I’m not one to mix shit in my whiskey but this one may change my habits. A little wood on the nose but mostly floor sweep from the auto mechanics garage. 
The palette is overwhelmed by mediocrity. One reviewer said not too offensive. 
Well. That is the definition of our Canadian brothers."
3.0,"Not too overpowering or complex. Some slight sweetness
This has been my grandfather's go to for decades"
2.0,"Nose- Astringent sugar 
Body- Not very hot. Easy enough to drink but not a lot going on. There is a sweet earthiness/ grassiness. 
Nose- Nope. It’s done."

1.0,"Nose: The nose starts with corn  notes and a sweet smell at first with a hint of exhaust then after a little while fades to nothing.

Taste: On the pallet there is no complexity: there's a bourbon-like sweetness and slightly oaky, with maybe a slight note of berries, but that quickly vanishes. In its place however is left a growing unpleasant / bitter mouthfeel at the back of the throat.

Opinion: It's not as bad as I was expecting. I'm glad I tried it, but won't be a go to except for perhaps a cheap mixer whisky. Cheers!"
