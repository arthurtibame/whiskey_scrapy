3.75,This had the misfortune of bring tasted in conjunction with the Ardbeg 19 which unfortunately smoked the pants off it. Also the memory of the awesome Red wine cask is still strong so in comparison to that it also fell short. So in summary tasted younger less richer or flavorful than either those two. I was too enamored with the Ardbeg to even bother seeking tasting descriptors. Might have been 4 on the day without the memory of the Red wine or being tried together with the Ardbeg...but 3.75 for me it is.

4.5,"Nose: true peat bog peat, not the medicinal Laphroaig peat, or the burning tire fire peat, but a true damp dirty earth lit ablaze. Salt, olive oil (the good thick stuff), cheese curds, dried wood, with just a hint of fruits, mostly a dark cherry. 


Taste: cereal, hay, bitter wood, Chestnut, grass, and a bit of pie crust.

Experience: eating a cheese board. Like the whole board wood and all. Cheese, olives, meat, salt... Wood. It's the whole board with everything on it. But in a fantastic way. If you want a meal in a whiskey this is it."
4.25,"To make a great wine cask matured whisky, get rid of most of the wine-soaked wood. Start by shaving its inside to remove some of that stained interior. Then toast it using wood chips to caremalise the exposed wood. After that, char it - throw more fire at the damn thing. Fire good, wine bad seems to be the message. Then throw away the cask - there’s still a hint of wine in it, after all. Okay, I went a step too far, but the lesson of this successful maturation experiment seems to be that a little wine cask goes a long way. Shaving, toasting and re-charring appears on the evidence of this bottling to provide an exceptional integration between cask and whisky. The influence of the wine is evident from the hint of red berries on the nose, but there’s also sea salt that speaks to the spirit. There’s sweetness on the palate too, but it’s mainly oily, savory and spicy, even a little meaty. The berries return on the finish, which leaves a long caramel aftertaste. All in all, it’s one of the most successful red-wine cask whiskies I’ve tried, better than many of the Longrow Reds and reminiscent of the best parts of the recent Bunnahabhain Bordeaux cask. Not a typical Kilchoman by any means, but a delicious diversion generously distributed in 14,500 bottles."
4.0,"Another quick hit review from the blind sample tasting. This was another stand out to me along with the Hazelburn 14. Here are my tasting notes:

Mouthfeel: Oily and fatty. Very mouthcoating.

Entry: Wood smoke, earthy peat, honey and dark chocolate with cinnamon sprinkles.

Mid:  Mixed nuts, dark red fruits and smoke

Finish: Long, wine oak, pepper and wood spice which lingers

Lovely Islay Whisky! Very different from others I have had and one I would happily purchase.

Cheers again @PBMichiganWolverine!"

4.0,"While pouring samples out last night to send to the crew ( @LeeEvolved, @Generously_Paul @Scott_E and others ), I had to try a few sips.  Granted, it wasn’t even a full 1 ounce...barely 2-3 sips, so who knows if that’s enough to form a full picture.  

This here is a new Kilchoman, matured in STR casks.  It’s a limited release, very much an experiment.  STR—so, “Shaved”, “Toasted”, and “Re-Charred” red wine  casks.  Theoretically that would  remove the red wine tannins and replacing it with more vanilla, while keeping the berry flavor from red wine cask.  

I’m a huge fan of Kilchoman.  And with the exception of the port cask, every release I’ve had of theirs has been 4 star+.  I love how the peat is prominent front and center, but not overpowering, and complimented by other flavors.  This one seems like it’s no exception.  I get summer berries on the nose, with an earthy peaty taste with more red berries.  Finish is long and lingering lemon-peat.  

I still like their Red Wine cask best, but this here at $70 is damn good as well."

4.5,"The smell is very delicate, with a soft sweetness of cooked apples, marzipan, honey, dates. The peat gradually opens, suspended between the herbaceous and the smoke, carried by a sea breeze that seems to caress the other aromas. Balanced and elegant.
On the palate the peat rises with imperious heat, compact and oily, raising a cloud of smoke in which banana, olives and chili pepper are mixed, a pinch of anise, ripe apple, cinnamon... it is a succession of very different aromas and impressions between them, a layered and complex malt, it takes time to untangle this skein. Hints of wood in the background, the peat that passes from herbaceous to fleshy, with the ash that mixes in the sea water. Tobacco. Lemon. It never really ends: the alcohol content is well integrated, one would drink it endlessly to find other aromas, other suggestions.
The finish is long, with ash, sea, banana, vanilla and spices."
