3.0,"I had a generous sample of this tonight at an American single malt event in New York. There’s light smoke on the nose and flavors of cured meat in the mouth. The finish is sweet, and extended by a drop of water. Perfectly fine but still not an answer to the existential question of why anyone would pay $90+ for American malt. Hopefully we’ll resolve that before the industry implodes, as there’s no doubting the sincerity of the distillers."

4.0,"I have loved the other two Westlands that I've tasted, and I've been astonished by how good they are after just a few years of maturation.  This whiskey is part of the west coast distillery's limited annual run of peated whiskies, in imitation of the smoky scotches of Islay.  It's $100 for a 3-5-year old whiskey, but that's the market nowadays.  This is one of those love-it-or-hate-it drams.  It's unlike anything that I've had before, and I kind of dig it.  But the smell alone will put a lot of people off, as it smells a little . . . rotten.  Not rotten, exactly, but like an overripe banana left out by a barbecue grill.  The taste is exactly like that, with strange flavors lacing through different sips: lychee or apricot, trail mix, banana, and rubbery peat.  It's tannic and has a dry mouthfeel.  Same themes on the swallow, with burnt tires, sour fruit, and overripe banana.  It's also long as hell."
4.0,Great peat. it is for sure the star of the show on top of a stage of great whiskey.

3.0,Enjoyed this one a lot. Nice blend of a hard peat taste with a sweet after
4.0,"Another sample courtesy of the distillery tour.   Apparently one week every year, the distillery in Seattle holds a big festive party, and this bottle is made in commemoration.  Their normal peated version is actually mixed with peated malt and unpeated.  But this one is fully all peated malt.  Side by side with the peated version, this fully peated one is definitely more complex and smokier.  Personnaly I still think their Garryana is by far the best, but this comes in second.  Strong smoke, followed by your typical Islay style medicinal qualities.  This is apparently made using Scottish Islay Peat,but they are working on a Washington state peated one, which should be out in 3 years."
