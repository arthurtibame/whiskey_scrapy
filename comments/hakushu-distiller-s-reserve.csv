4.0,"Light and smokey but does not quite live up to the Hakushu 12. The burn on the palate is evident though not so much on the nose

That said this is still wonderful, refreshing and with such balanced peat it’s a crowd pleaser"

3.0,"Japanese whiskey, Japanese whiskey.  Well, I've pretty much expressed my view on the topic:  great whiskies, but overhyped and overpriced in the current market.  Hakushu and Yamazaki are two of Suntory's single malt distilleries, and of the two, there's a divide among fans about which is better.  Hakushu lightly peats their whiskey, so one would expect that it's my favorite.  Surprisingly, not so!  Hakushu has a swirl of fruit flavors, plums, peaches, and other stone fruits, with the counterpoint being a cedar wood and slight smoke (particularly in the finish) from the peated component.  It's nice, but a little generic.  I had a bottle of Hakushu 12 several years ago, and it had a more distinctive and unique character, which is lost in this new, no-age-statement expression."

Sweet melon on the nose, alcoholic but doesn't burn your nose.

Sweet, not a hint of wood, which is fantastic, smooth and rounded, no burn. 

First savoured at Level33 on 33 birthday."

2.0,"I have to be honest, not a fan of this one. On the nose I got nothing except alcohol for a while, then a slight pine cone nose, very faint vanilla and small amounts of peat. Taste is a lot of alcohol burn again (sure that this has 43 and not more?), some peat and a bit of malt sweetness. Aftertaste is short peaty malt. Not my taste to be completly honest. I will try the 12 too, but the distiller's reserve falls flat for me. 2 Points because it is still drinkable, 1 star is reserves for diesel disguised as whiskey."

3.0,"I had a sample of this after a business dinner this past week.  Maybe I've been spoiled by the Hakushu 12, which I absolutely loved.  That had this green forest pine aroma, with a grassy peaty combination.  I was hoping for the same in this, I guess, naively.   It's got the 12 year old's herb-y fresh  palette, but really muted.  As if it was diluted, or simply too young.   It's good...but, really no where as close as the 12.  I sort of relate this to the Hibiki Harmony vs  Hibiki 12...the Harmony is good, but it's a shadow compared to the 12.  Pass this up...save up for the Hakushu 12.  Well worth the extra bucks."

4.0,"This is a decent and light whisky with notes of kiwi and hints of peat. Preference between this and the Hakushu 12 depends on one’s flavor profile. Want a light whisky that is very smooth and also works for sipping neat, on big block of ice, highball, or cocktail, go with distiller Reserve. Want something with more flavors, go with Hakushu 12 that is soon to be discontinued. Rack up on the Hakushu 12s if ur in the latter as the distiller Reserve is not sold in the US and Hakushu 18 prices could go up roof like yamazaki 18 with Hakushu 18 soon being only Hakushu available in US."

4.0,Wish I could give another 1/2 star on this. For some reason Hakushu’s distillers seem to be getting better with  new batches or maybe it’s just my mind thinking that they’ve included some hakushu 12 magic into the newer batches

5.0,"Knocks the Yamazaki into a cocked hat. I’ve lived here in Japan for almost 30 years and tried a fair few Japanese whiskies in that time. For me Hakushu makes the best of the lot, though Yoichi (Nikka) runs it close. Crisp, clean, a decent touch of fruit, especially apple, but also pear and weirdly, gooseberries, the delicate peat accentuates the malt... perfect. Sadly, the 12 yo is now practically impossible to find, and even the nas version turns up only once in awhile, while the prices for all Japanese whiskies are getting a bit silly. But this Hakushu is the one you really should search out. I actually rate this above the 12yo for its crystal clarity and precision. Stunning, really!"
4.0,"NOSE: It’s like a damp pine forest with fresh green grasses, with a doused campfire from the night before adding gentle smoky notes. Quite unique.

TASTE: Lime zest. Salted taffee. Green apple peel. Bold, but harmonious.

FINISH: White pepper with green apples stays with you, lacking any oaky bitterness or spicyness.

OVERALL: One of the best tasting whiskeys I’ve tried. Real, deep flavors rather than the usual sweet, spicy burn."

3.25,"Some whiskies strike me quite differently with every dram. Hakushu DR is one of them. It’s pale, with a piney, faintly smoky aroma like toned-down Oude Genever. The palate is malt-forward, then oily, sweet and fruity, with a medium-length finish that recalls damp turf over peat. When I’m feeling as if I don’t really love Scotch malt (gasp!), I don’t much like this. In a Scotch-friendly phase, I think it’s quite fine. Never a favourite though."

4.0,Super light with a natural fruity scent. Tastes and smells of natural melon. Excellent just because of the clean aftertaste.
2.5,"The Whisky legend that is @PBMichiganWolverine graciously provided me a sample of this Japanese Whisky. I am a huge fan of the Hakashu 12 so was very intrigued to see how this one held up. This is an NAS version that allegedly contains Whisky as old as 18yrs old.... Let's dive in...

It enters pretty softly but with decent body... Fruity notes initially that recede to reveal soft smoke and pine... ginger and grapefruit on the mid palate with a medium smoke and pine filled finish. It's drying and that's where you detect some youth. 

All in all it's tasty but unfortunately I tasted the Hakashu 12 right after it and this was definitely a significant step down. I'm isolation I'd rate it higher but as is it's slightly above average! 

Cheers again @PBMichiganWolverine and cheers all!"

3.75,"The mere words “Japanese whiskey” brings about images of exotic, expensive, and very good whiskey.  Good enough to have given their Scottish counterparts a run for their money.  But the last few years, it’s been difficult to discern between real Japanese whiskey, and those sourced from Canada, Scotland, and US.  In Japan, with regulations being loose about this, one can source whiskey from anywhere, and as long as it’s aged (for unspecified time) in Japan, it’s still labeled Japanese whiskey.  So, you think you’re buying a 16 yr Yamazakura ( sounds like Yamazaki...that alone adds a few extra quid), but in reality you’re getting a 16 yr Canadian or American.  But, there’s still some pure Japanese made—like -Hakushu ( along with Yamazaki, Yoichi, Chita, and few others).  Unfortunately the age statements are rare and expensive, 

I opened this from my stash last night, with some family over for the holidays.  I was in no mood to open my Hakushu 12, 18 or Heavily Peated, so I grabbed this one.  

I love Hakushu’s aroma—-pine and forests.  Taste is peaty, with more of that fresh forest.  Sweet finish.

If not for having tried their amazing 12, I’d have given this a 4-4.25.  But, as good as it is, it’s not there with the 12.  Still...really well made,  if you’re choosing a true Japanese NAS, this is one of them better bets."

4.0,"Bad Japanese Whiskies do not exist. That is a true fact. This Single malt, is no exception to that rule. This is a solid Whisky in the nose and palate.

Bottled at 43%abv, with an insanely white wine color (almost transparent).

On the nose is a mixture between Japanese and scotch Whiskies: Sherry, Brown cake, Raisins, Oranges, Wet grass, Lemons, Liquorice, Cinammon and Honey.

On the palate it is a little straightforward: Tobbacco and pepper are the main notes.
Slight caramel, Liquorice. Long finish, Hot with lots of character.

Overall i give this excelent dram an 87 over 100 (almost a 4.5). Cheers!"
