Tastes like I threw up in my mouth, then ate copper pennies, then ends with a little licorice. Saving this for the zombie apocalypse."

2.0,"Pours from the fancy bottle a nice reddish gold color. Fragrant nose. Almost perfume-ish (maybe subliminal due to the shape of the bottle?). Grainy with dried fruit and heavy sherry notes. Neat it starts sweet and grainy. Then the sherry takes over. I think this is where the problem lies. I suspect that the sherry previously housed in these barrels may not have been of the highest quality. Finishes slightly hot for an 80 proof and leaves a lingering jumble of flavors on the palate. Metallic, fruity, perfumey (again, maybe subliminal from the shape of the bottle?), bitter. This is a muddled mess. I do feel that there are some potentially good notes here, they are just overwhelmed by cheap sherry. This will not be a repeat buy for me."

It's not very complex, but it doesn't need to be - it's delicious as it is. Like white grape pear juice and a combination of red and teal Fruit Roll-Ups. Skip the water on this one."

4.0,I bought this for the bottle design + single malt + price ($25 USD at Binny's). Desert sweetness with a hint of smoke. Strangely it paired really well with Oreos. For the price I only have one complaint: it's impossible to pour this bottle without dribbling down the side. I guess there's a reason you don't see hexagonal bottles very often.

3.0,"Wow, what a nice Irish Whiskey for the price (~$21.99/750ml). It scores high on my price point vs. complexity scale as it give you a very nice flavor profile for its cheap price.  I consider ""cheap"" anything under $26/750ml.  This is a sliding scale as liquor prices have increased over the past few year.  If you like a neat little Irish Whiskey on a budget I really recommend this one.  Hell, even if you are not on a budget, try it.  As with anything it is a personal choice and if you do not like it, you did not spend a lot of your hard earned cash on a whim."

4.0,"After reading the reviews and loving the look of the bottle, I finally caved in and got a bottle after Abby's last episode of NCIS. You have to admit the look is all Abby.
Anyway, the real selling point is a single malt Irish under $30.00, who could say no?
The nose is sweet and and I'm getting apricots and candied fruits. The taste is sweet, sherried, and for some reason, more than a bit grainy. But it is smooth and delicate. The apricots are there also. Shorter finish, with some milk chocolate. This would be a five star whiskey if it was at 43 -46 ABV.
As good as the bottle looks, it is terrible to pour from. This should be on eveyone's list."

The nose isn’t the prettiest, there is a metallic note that messes with the sherry, cocoa and caramel apple aromas.
The palate, especially the tail end, is where this beauty really shines. 
Sherry nuttiness, toffee, dried fruit, and a malt chocolate milkshake sweetness. 
The finish holds on, despite not being very heavy or oily. 
Is this going to compete with $60+ sherry cask scotch? No. But, it does punch far above its price point. $25 well spent."

3.75,"Medium-light body. Light overall, but heavy on fruit and sweetness, and a bit of rye like spice. Smooth and very drinkable. This is a good whisky for the price. $22-27.00 in my locale. To me, Irish Whiskies are almost never offensive or unpleasant to drink. But, rarely do they keep me coming back for more. I usually reach for the scotch after the first dram, and this one is no exception."
3.0,"This whiskey is really just fine, especially for $30 a bottle.

The nose has an above average burn, but is pleasantly sweet with a cherry blossom, strawberry, raspberry, and pear quality.  A little bit of caramel or caramel apple is evident when nosing from a distance.

The body is thinner than I want, and I bet this whiskey would be amazing if it had a thicker or more oily texture.

The flavor is fruity and sweet, with a hint of coffee and toffee on the back end.  Maybe there's something of a cafe con leche flavor going on."

4.0,"It's been a while since I've had anything Irish, let alone sherried, so this might have a bit of an effect.

Nose:  Big pear and green apple burst at the beginning followed by a darker, sweet red cherry and stewed fruits.  Reminds me of spiced apple cider with the baking spices tossed on top of all that fruit. I have to search around a bit for the malty base, but it's there as a rich buttery cereal.

Palate: Slightly tart cherries and a bit of apricot? A fleeting floral, honey sweetness follows.  Big, buttery maltiness comes next, a little oilier than I remember.  Shortbread biscuits with a little extra butter. A subtle cedar sawdust now, though not in a bad way, accents the malt notes.

Finish: Long finish that rides pretty neutral in astringency.  The most prominent component is a sweet, uplifting floral note.  A little honey and pear sweetness rounds out the floral note as it drifts away from the grain and malt characteristics.  Towards the very end a nuttiness like a mixture of fresh almond and toasted coconut appears.

Conclusion:  To be honest, I don't remember liking this one this much.  I expected it to be much simpler, like I had noted before, but I found much more complexity this time.  If every dram of this were like the one I just had, I'd definitely buy again."
3.5,"Nothing crazy or adventurous, but very good for what it is, a sweet, clean, all around good Irish whiskey."

I find this one better on ice or with a little sparkling water. Save your money for Redbreast or a Bushmills single malt if you’re looking for a better Irish expression to drink neat. 

I will give props for the cool bottle. Unique packaging and not uneasy to pour as some other reviews suggest."

My only gripe is the 40% ABV...this at 43-50% would be an absolute world beater!"

I get that; but, wait until you try to poor from it and see how many drops you waste. Kaiser sure hit that on the head.

Palate: Again, classic Irish - shortbread cookies, banana bread with walnuts.  Slightly tannic, with the sherry coming across sweeter than on the nose.  Green apples, honey.  Berries and cream.  Mouthfeel is medium light.  Finish on this is easygoing - begins with apples, shortbread, nuts, and cream while a sherry undertone sits low in the mix.  As things evolve, the cream and nuts fade away while some pear pokes in.  Then the apples shift into red territory (instead of green) and eventually you're left with sweet wine and red apples.  Finish is medium in length.

Other notes: Imagine a continuum of Jameson and Redbreast 12 - this sits in the middle between them in terms of palate.  It's not the most complex thing ever, but it offers up just enough to be an interesting addition to your explorations of Irish whiskey.  Especially if you can find it on sale."

4.25,"For only $30 in Michigan, meaning about 10% of its cost is taxes, this is a phenomenal whiskey, far better than a typical daily drinker. And its regularly available at a basic grocery store! 

It rivals and actually bests Tyr Connell Madeira casked 10 year and Sherry casked 10 year. I haven't had any other Irish whiskeys except Teeling rum casked and Jameson, which is crap--harsh and overpriced. Except Jameson's Beer Barrel Stout casked edition and Black Barrel Reserve, which I've had too long ago, a couple of years, to directly compare.

The mostly mellow taste and complex woody notes remind me of Macallan Edition 3. This is one of my favorite ever low priced whiskeys. The Sexton Single Malt will remain a standard in my collection probably until the day I die."

3.0,"Once you get past the alcohol, the first note I get on the nose is vanilla, and the first tasting note is oak. It has a definite alcohol burn. Not a sweet whiskey, nor strong floral or fruity notes. But no peat or smokiness whatsoever, which is fine by me. On the finish, there's not much taste left in the mouth after swallowing; the burn fades to blank. It's okay, but there are other whiskies I've enjoyed more."

Definitely an Irish whiskey with subtle sweetness likely from the sherry"

4.5,Not the most complex of whiskeys but sometimes that’s a good thing if you want one to sit on and enjoy. This is probably one of my top favorite Irish whiskeys just because of how smooth the finish is.

4.0,"Sweet, honey and butterscotch and orange notes. Not really complex, not a ton of wood notes but a pleasant, smooth palate.

Got this for $27 at the NH liquor store. A great single malt for not a lot of money, will buy again"
3.5,"I had this at my Dad's house before Thanksgiving and enjoyed it but I was on a Scotch and Colonel EH Taylor Small Batch tasting expedition. Now just before Christmas, I had a chance to revisit Sexton and I really enjoyed it. It reminds me of Bushmills Red Bush Irish Whiskey in that it is fruity and smooth. I had it neat and it was a solid sipping whiskey, but I really enjoyed it with some ice as it mellowed the flavors. I will say that the bottle is very cool but it is what is inside that will keep me buying this more than once. In my area, it is about $23 a bottle so it is an easy yes for me. I will try this in drinks when I get my next bottle. Enjoy and Merry Christmas everyone."

3.5,"A good looking bottle of an Irish Whiskey. I believe it is cheap and it does the job. Basically the Sexton Single Malt is your average dram. 

Bottled at 40%abv.

On the nose, Cherries, Vanilla, Banana. It is Sweet dram with No alcohol note at all.
Caramel and toffee. I can bet american white oak was used to mature this one.

On the palate, Nice mashed bananas, Pepper. Very Smooth and Simple dram. Aftertaste has a ginger note and also a bitter tobacco but pleasant finish. 

Overall, this dram is a good option for an everyday whiskey. It doesn't feel irish, but it is drinkable. 76/100"
