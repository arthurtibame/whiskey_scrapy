5.0,"It's hard to disengage from the extraordinary nose on this rye, which has layers of perfume, banana, orgeat and other tiki flavors topped with a dash of pepper. When you eventually remember that the contents of your glass are there to drink you get a funky mix of Szechuan peppers and guava, served on a rain-soaked deck as the sun dries the wood. Searingly spicy, it finishes long and dry. Water tames the heat and brightens the tropical notes. Curiously compelling and somewhat eccentric, it's quite unlike other ryes of its age. (PS: I'm offering samples on Bottle-Spot if you're interested in trying it.)"

4.0,"Depth on the nose, but a bit muted. Some clove and apple. Bubbly on the palate, seems effervescent. Pleasant spices throughout. Cola and apple pie, some baking spice. Just a hint of floral rye. Not as herbal as I was expecting. Finishes a bit dry, which balances the sweetness. Nicely done. 10/2/17"

5.0,"On the nose I get a ton of fresh cut oak, the tongue is full of rye spice and sweetness, but it's a bit richer than I was expecting. All in all very similar to the 13 year, I expected the extra 3 years to mute it a bit but found it to be pretty bright and sharp!"

4.0,"Thanks to Richard, I got to sample this one last night.  This is very un-Rye like.  Bold and oaky.   Baking spices laying on freshly cut oak.  Everything about it is intense.  I felt as if I really needed water to loosen it up a bit.  After water, it sweetens to a more rye character with the nutmeg, licorice and mint.  Great fall weather Dram. Thanks Richard!"

4.5,"Spicy, of course. Vanilla, of course. Oak, of course. 
Me thinks drinking such deliciousness helps me summon my inner Hemingway.  
'Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.'
There is.....just a bit more LS&B 16 yr left in my glass."

4.75,Maybe the best rye I've had.
4.5,"Giggity. Giggity. Giggity.  So spicy, so smooth. These are flavors of which my mouth has no reference points.  Easily my favorite high rye, surpassing the LS&B 13.  Can the 18 be any better than this?"
1.5,Bottle has strong flavor or celery & mothballs. Might have been open too long..

4.0,"darker & toastier flavor than its color would make you believe.  tons of rye spice, licorice & pepper.  couple drops of water brings more sweetness, but is just fine as is.  as burly a rye as you could ever want."

4.0,"I was given a sample of this from a local friend who has given up on drinking spirits.  I’m not sure if this stuff is rare, expensive or hard to find.  I’m not even sure what a bottle costs.  I just know it’s a 16 year old, 100% Canadian rye whiskey.  It’s bottled at 53.5% and is dark copper in the tasting glass.  Heavy droplets curve the entire rim and it makes lots of legs.

The nose it typical rye spice, pepper a little pine and dill with an underlying vanilla and oak note.  The palate is hot and peppery baking spices, sugary cola with a nice hint of bubble gum on the tail end.  To be 100% rye, it’s not overpowering at all- even at 54%.  I think that’s what I like the most about it.  I’m not a big rye person, so when I get one that seems really well restrained I feel like I can enjoy it more.  That was the case here.  The finish was medium length, oily with some lingering oak notes.

Overall, it’s very easy drinking with a lighter than expected mouthcoat and feel.  I’m glad I was able to give this one a try as I aim to expand my American bourbon and rye portfolio.  Thanks to my buddy @RyanS1865 for this one.  4 stars.  Cheers."

5.0,"While I had tasted it for the first time, I thought it was secondary to L.S.&B. 13yo.... But while I finished the whole bottle, I tend to love it more. Definitely less fruity & brown spices notes than 13yo, while enhancing the floral & savory spices characters."
