If you like to save the nice stuff for friends and special occasions, you can do worse than old crow for just relaxing or as a quick nightcap. Best neat. Also, it is better in coke than jack daniels, there, I said it."

1.0,"The Ohioan whiskey lover in me wishes for a closer bond with our great alcoholic president and sipping this with a respirator would be a good start. But I just can't do it. For me, this straight is intolerable and on ice is just asking for trouble. It is just one step above trying to drink Southern Comfort and relaxing. Sweet, dirty liquor is not made for a casual night out and that's where I categorize this gem. It belongs on the shelf in a frat or a hunting camper but nowhere else."

Great for mixing because it's so harsh. I'd use it in an old fashioned made with Demerara  simple syrup."

3.0,"Maybe I give stars too easily, but I just had a glass of this neat, almost as a dare to myself. I expected horrible, grainy hi-test corn fuel, instead I had a pretty normal if hum-drum bourbon. A little corn sweet, a little vanilla, a touch of barrel spice and that was about it. Boring? Yup. But nothing else to criticize either. Three stars based on price (it was a $2 pour at the bar I was at, I basically said ""screw it"" while I was waiting for my takeout order).
  Now I'm actually curious about Old Crow Reserve."

4.0,3.75. Great smell! Very sweet on the nose. Definitely worth the purchase. However the taste is fairly weak as well as the finish. Honey and corn.
1.0,Sweet nuts and artificial butter. Sickly sweet. Hate to think about what what this would taste like after more than one drink
2.0,Young and corny.
3.0,"What this lacks in complexity it makes up for with sheer drinkability. Smooth to a fault. Not much going on, but nothing about it tastes bad. For 17 bucks a half gallon, I'll give it three stars based on it ability to shoot or be mixed. Good value."

4.0,"I was surprised by the versatility and smoothness of Old Crow. What it lacks in complexity, it makes up as a mixer. It’s sweet, warm, and has a nice soft vanilla on the nose. The finish is moderately quick, warm, and I love that it practically adds flavor with a touch of heat as a mixer.

I tried this both neat and in Coke. I prefer a woody, spicy bourbon myself. However, this has a place in one’s liquor cabinet for those who enjoy the 5:30 shift after long 9 to 5.

There’s a lot of hate going towards this bourbon for all the wrong reasons. Yes, it’s cheap. Yes, it’s bottom shelf. But that’s not what a rating should be nor should it cloud your judgment of it."

3.0,"A younger Jim Beam. Least expensive straight bourbon in my state. Light, drinkable with a surprising amount of character. Solid cheap bourbon."
3.0,"Appearance: The color of this straight bourbon is a surprising copper. It also has very thin oily legs.

Nose: The nose starts you on your journey with salted caramel syrup, followed by corn, a sweet floral bouquet, Graham Crackers, and vanilla. There’s also a mustiness and some moss or decaying leaves. The more time it breathes the sweeter it seems to get.

Taste: The first thing I notice is this whiskey has an oily body like a WWE wrestler. Notes on the palate consist of cherry Jolly Rancher, black tea with cream, caramel candy, a light dustiness, and a weird kale note.

Finish: There is a short finish, leaving an almost fruity ashy note, like a flavored aromatic pipe tobacco.

Thoughts: In my opinion, this bourbon is good. I like it, it’s familiar enough while still unique enough to stand out. It’s better than I thought for a whiskey in this price bracket, though I would love to see what a higher ABV would do to it. I would recommend this if you’re looking for a cheap bourbon while still wanting some quality. Beam, you do this brand justice. Cheers!"

3.0,"Old Crow..... Bottom shelf, cheap bourbon, low proof, not complicated. 

Okay so I bought a bottle of this based on a clerks suggestion stating “one of the regular that spends hundreds here a week says it’s just as good as Buffalo Trace”. Well it’s honestly not far from the truth because A) Buffalo Trace ain’t that great and B) Old Crow is not the worst thing I ever tasted in the bourbon world. So I found this 1.75 on the bottom shelf of course and on clearance at Walgreens for a whopping $11 so I said “what the hell”. 

When I first opened the bottle and gave her a little pour I was expecting corn and fire but what I got instead was a smooth boring bourbon. I’ve since had a few drunk friends come over and ask for old fashioned’s and used this of course as the base since I’m not giving them anything good out of my cabinet. I also mistakenly lost the cap to the bottle because of partaking in too many other spirits one evening. I used a piece of tin foil as a makeshift cap and it’s since “aerated” possibly because 2 months later and this stuff is now even smoother?? Weird. I’m not complaining though. 

If you happen to find 1-3/4 liters of this stuff for $11 don’t pass it up because it has many uses.....Eggnog mixer, cakes, bourbon infused meats, or even a knock-off Buffalo Trace for drunken friends etc. etc."

2.5,"Got a 1.75 as a mixer over the Corona Virus Stay at Home Order. On the nose, I smell a sour yeasty aroma. Feel on the palate is light with alcohol a very slight vanilla oak. Finish has some spice and I get a hair of licorice. Made an Old Fashioned with it. Ok as a mixer."
2.0,"Decided to downshift after buying some higher priced whiskeys and head to the bottom shelf. This was on sale for $7.99 , how cheap is that! Bargain if its any good at all. Ive read some horror stories online but wanted to see for myself. Poured neat, thin legs but looks like bourbon in a glass. Nose is Beam like gentle spice and soft grain with wispy dusty oak. Nothing offensive or harsh just have to work to get much out. Thin mouthfeel brings palate of candy corn, spice, cardboard and mild wood with a slight sourness to it. Flavor is subdued leading to short finish of fading corn, spice and dry wood shavings. Reminds me a little of a cut down Beam Black. All that being said this was 8 bucks and I don't think it was made to be pondered over and studied. Im sure it will be fine as a mixer in coke or whatever you like and its much better than Canadian whisky..........72/100...... good value for the money with some dusty spice that grows on you. Nothing special but not rot gut as some web reviews would have you believe"
