4.5,"Nose: Loads of bright red fruits and toasty malt notes!  There's some candied orange peel, berry syrup, oak spice, and dry shortbread cookies with a bit of icing sugar.  Floating above all the fruit is a bit of spice that's a bit hard to separate from the ethanol burn, but helps to balance the sweetness.

Palate: Thick, sweet, and syrupy on the tongue.  It's an explosion of tropical fruits like I've never tasted in a whiskey! Orange and lime citrus, something like sweet, sweet mango, and some light honey to bind it all together.  There's a base of deeply toasted malt that is much fuller than many malt-forward whiskies.

Finish: Short to medium length and slightly dry in the back.  It's a tropical fruit bomb the whole way, like a stick of Juicy Fruit gum.

Conclusion:  I've never found so much tropical fruit in a whiskey before!  The closest I can remember is probably Teeling's Small Batch.  There's a gorgeous balance of sweet fruit sugars, sour tropical acidity, spice, and rounded malt - all of whoch are pretty powerful in there, so the balance is necessary.  It's a bit pricey, but I love the liquid and the brand, so I'd buy a bottle if I somehow found one on the shelf in the US.  I keep coming back to taste it, it's refreshing and draws me back again and again - I think I like it more every time!

Again, it just gets better and better, now I definitely want to find a full bottle of this..."

4.5,"Nose: Bright and sweet. Citrus fruits blending with honey. Some apple as well. Delightful.

Palate: A tad oily. Orange and apples come through immediately. Vanilla lingers with a hint of ginger.

Finish: Medium. Smooth and virtually no roughness. Apples lingering the longest of anything.

Overall Thoughts: This is a delightful whiskey. It isn’t rough around the edges or too demanding on the palate. Very little alcohol burn. Delicious blend of flavors. I picked this one up a year ago and I’ve never regretted it. A fine choice to sit and relax with. Thank goodness for the Banner County!"
2.75,"N: Juicy fruit.
P: Grass - really delicious, tastes like a fresh-cut lawn.

This is the best Irish Whisky I've tried so far (an admittedly small list)."
