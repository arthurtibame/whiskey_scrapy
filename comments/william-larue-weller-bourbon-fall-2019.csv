4.5,"Nose is incredible, no hint of alcohol but sweet cherries and slight tea notes, leather. Palate is sweet, rich with essentially apple pie that compliments a long finish. No burn whatsoever."
3.75,"Nice, high proof."

4.5,"Neat. Neck pour. Deep honey and nectar.  Vanilla and baking spice.  Deep berries and cream.  Cinnamon.  More honey and nectar.  Hint of oak but just a hint.  

Super thick and syrupy on the tongue.  Really coats the mouth. Honey and nectar again come to mind on the tongue with a blast of sweetness.  Waves of honey and vanilla fade to chocolate and back to honey.   Subsequent sips were getting darker with these rich, burnt caramels.

This is my first WLW experience.  I was expecting something spicier versus this sweet honey, nectar.  It’s impressive but the first impression puts it below the ‘19 GTS."
4.5,"Nose: cherry up front and oak
Palate: hot cherries and cinnamon with light caramel
Finish: long cherries. Very well done"

4.25,Strong start and a really smooth finish
5.0,"Nose is cherries almost tart. You can smell the boozieness and it ain't bad. After this opened up I got a lot more caramel in the nose.

Cherry/Berry taste with amazing barrel char flavor. Spices and Carmel mingle and slight vanilla throughout with a leather finish"

4.0,"Cinnamon, baking spices, a little spicy and dry back palate finish"
4.5,Nose is oaky spice. Taste is spicy sweet with a oaky spice finish
4.75,"The color is a brownish amber that heavily coats the glass. The nose is buttery while also being oaky as baking spices, soft sugar and fresh bread finish it off. The palate is sweet oaky and pleasantly spicy with pepper that warms the mouth for a full and rich palate, with sweet notes of vanilla and butter coming together for a wonderful experience. The finish is long spicy with creamy and sweet oak lingering and taking its time to fade."
3.5,Hot nose. Good body. Cherries linger on the finish which is quite nice. Good but not worth the hype.
4.5,Very good pour. Lots of cherry and barrel
4.5,Straight cherries

4.5,"Almost a perfect bourbon! If you can find it anywhere near retail buy it, if you don’t love the higher proof then add a few drops of water, but if you like high proof enjoy as is and be amazed at the great things that BT has to offer. It’s like pappy on steroids!"

4.75,"Butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon on the nose. Brown sugar, spices, and fruits on the complex pallet. Perfect amount of heat on the back end at 128 proof. Amazing bourbon!"
4.75,"Fantastic nose, it's sweet and fruity (prune, fig), then you get the old wheated flavors, the oak, it's a little hot on the nose, but on the palate, it's complex, well rounded, the finish goes on and ending with a nice candy flavor, nice stuff, didn't try with water yet. It's better than the 2018, not yet the 2016, but it's close, at least to me."
4.0,"Nose Sweet, cherries, oak, really enjoyable
Palate a continuance of the nose
Finish long, spice"

5.0,"Nose- Oak and brown sugar prominent. Similar profile to fitzgerald but more intense and a tad more oak. Vanilla ice cream
Palate - Rich Vanilla frosted pastries. Tart green apples. Almost like an apple tart with a very sweet cream.
Finish- Oily, with lingering green apple. Had instances of almost carrot cake like. Apple ebbs and flows through the slightly numbing finish"
5.0,"Sugar, butterscotch and apple pie! Holy crap! Da best I have ever tasted, in whiskey!"
