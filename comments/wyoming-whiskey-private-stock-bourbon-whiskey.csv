3.5,"A&B Store Pick at 107 proof. Haven't heard great things about this one, but the store picks are pretty good at A&B so we will give it a whirl. Nose is nice of sweet corn and brown sugar. Taste defintely brings some young ethanol heat which isn't terribly pleasant.  Flavor is pretty strong though of dried fruit and molasses. Overall this one needs some more barrel time, but defintely has the bones to be a nice mash after some aging. Interested to see what WW produces when they hit 10 years. Not a drain pour by any means, but probably not something I would seek out again. They also make a double barrel that I might sample to see if the extra barrelling helps soften the burn."

4.0,"Each of these Private Stock Single Barrel - Cask Strength selections is going to slightly differ from the next. Mine, for instance is 111 proof and I’ve now sampled 3 individual selections that were between 108-111. I also was lucky that my bottle came from a great barrel. I’ve heard that some were downright terrible however, I don’t know the barrel number, production year or any other details of those. Much like WW’s Small Batch Bourbon, I get the caramel, vanilla, black tea and some herbaceous notes. The higher proof just extends the finish and brings in a nice spicy dose of cardamom or ginger that goes forever. A few drops of water really brings out that awesome barrel char profile that Wyoming Whiskey always seems to have. If you’re a fan of Wyoming Whiskey and this is available, I say give it a shot. A private select, single cask bottle of bourbon for $45-49? Unheard of. Go for it! Barrel #1929"
