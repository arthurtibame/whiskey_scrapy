4.5,Dramfest 2020. Amazing they had this in the normal 'free range'. When we saw that unicorn we shot to the table first. They made people try the rest of the range and didn't believe me when I told him I already had..which was true bar 1. He thought I was lying as the Octaves had just came to NZ. He obviously hadn't heard of MoM! Very very nice despite the hint of peppermint.

4.75,Nectar of gods. Amazing burn and amazing flavor. Coconut vanilla taste. Tiny eraser phosphor. Sherry bomb. What I would have hoped for a higher age macallan plus the fun burn of an oban.
