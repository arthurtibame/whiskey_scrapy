3.0,"Exactly what I hoped for, just didn't taste good the first time I had it after Glenlivet. Can taste fruit and fudge, not the candy. But the spice and the caramel is great.

Maybe a 3.5 erring on the ""I'm in a good mood side"".

The sweet malt is stronger on later tastings and helps balance the spice."

4.0,The aroma is rich with vanilla with notes of Chocolate and Oak. It has a spicyness to it that covers the entire palate and down the throat.  The rich full bodied taste is great to enjoy while relaxing for the night or with light company.

3.0,Nose is sweet floral with a smokey hint. Taste starts out sweet fruity with nice build up to a smokey and heavy peper finish. Opened up great with a teaspoon of water did take some of the smokey and pepper flavor away but opened up a nice vilinlla after tase. Could smell the vilinlla more with the water. Overall good everyday cheaper side blend comparable to Johnnie walker black however with less burning after taste

Easy sipping for an everyday go to whisky. [85/100][Tasted: 6/21/15]"

2.0,"So after a halcyon month of May off hooch (try it sometime, I learned new things about myself and others), I let fly the cork of the first fifth of this year's summer drinking collection. And believe-you-me, I was worried my palate would be mossy, even a trifle askew from disuse, but much to my delight, it's still with me, because I could readily tell this stuff is, well... sorta-kinda-crappy. Don't get me wrong, for the price, it's perfectly drinkable, even enjoyable, but if I started my whisky odyssey with this blend, I don't think it would have had the same momentum...

Nose: ""Son of Aberfeldy 12"". Uncanny resemblance. It's a ""core malt"", I know, but still stands out above the other 39 players. Mostly oak, light pear and ginger ale, plus a touch of mustiness, like an old library book. Seriously, if you like this nose, you'll LOVE Aberfeldy on its own. 

Palate: Here's where the apple falls far from the tree... A surprisingly creamy, yet thin flavor of tired oak and vanilla stumbles awkwardly over tangerine and a not entirely welcome bittersweet, tea-like astringency.

Finish: more of the same. Both palate and finish are less bittersweet with (just a half-teaspoon) of water, but unfortunately softens the nose (it's only redeeming feature, IMHO). 

The grain components are better integrated and less noticeable than other blends I've sampled... but still a suboptimal dram. Dry glass: sweet grain and dry orange peel."

Some berry flavour. A touch of pretzel dough, which is a note I get in a lot of lower-end blends. Taste is thin but surprisingly creamy. Faint smoke. Honey, pepper. Sherried fruits. Apple, plum. Smoky finish,with light oak, honey, and vanilla. Not a great whisky, but a steal for the price. Let it sit for 30 minutes before drinking and most of the off-notes fade entirely. Good bargain sipper."

3.0,"The nose is really good, fruity, buttery, and a whisp of smoke. On the Palate is same flavours as the nose but also is really rich for a blend and has a nice sherry taste to it. But this is where it shows that this is a blend, can taste some grain but not in a gross way. Its matured quite well with only a slight tint of bitternes. Its also quite smooth. It's a bit spicey but the good thing is its not extremely grainy which is nice. Spicey fruity, a tiny bit of smoke finish, and it's quite short. For the price I would say this is on par with johnnie walker black label. Tastes like the white label but a bit smoother and less rough around the edges and more intense.

3.5 out of 5, I paid $35 CAD for this any wouldn't pay over $40"

3.0,"I had never tried a blended scotch before now. I dove into the scotch world head first with single malts. So I decided to see what the big deal was between the blended and single malt worlds. I chose Dewars 12 yr as my first blended scotch, partly due to their excellent ad campaign (seriously, who doesn't like the ad with the guy on the motorcycle bringing a bottle of scotch to see his Dad?) and partly because it was an age stated blend at a very reasonable $35. Now I get it.

Dewars 12 yr is a blend of ""over 40"" different scotch whiskys, with the bulk of the blend coming from Aberfeldy, ""the distillery that Dewars built"" according to the web. Having never had any Aberfeldy I can't comment to that but I can tell that this blended scotch (and I assume others as well) is just a toned down (i.e., watered down) version of single malt scotch. It has all of the characteristics of a single malt but none of the ""oomph"". Flavor without the punch, fireworks without the boom, choose your euphemism.

Dewars 12 yr is bottled at 40% ABV. In the glass this dram is a medium gold color. Swirling produces quick, skinny legs with some visible water beads. The nose is what I have come to think of as a typical scotch profile: floral, honey sweetness with orchard fruits (apples, pears). Very mild and no complexity at all. The palate is more of the same: sweet honey, orchard fruits, and pepper. The finish is short and unremarkable with some oak tones and more pepper.

I can see why this is popular: it's very easy drinking (almost too easy!), has no objectionable flavors, and doesn't overpower the senses. But once you've developed a palate for single malts/peat/barrel strength whiskys, this is very underwhelming. I'm sure there are some out there who would think this is the bomb. But for me, it's just average. 3/5. Cheers!"
2.0,Sharp aftertaste. Not very complex or memorable. Has a tea-like taste.
2.5,"Nose: Some caramel and fruit, but it's quite low key. Light bodied and not a whiff of smoke.

Palate: Far better than the nose. Ultra soft arrival with delightfully light and subtle fruity flavours, featuring sweet oranges. Very creamy, but not honey sweet, and a little touch of smoke does show up on the palate. Well balanced for a blend in this price range.

Finish: Short, and a slight let-down after the development as it trails off into a tannic finale that is a little too bitter, like over-brewed English Breakfast tea.

If not for the somewhat disappointing finish this would be a very good blend for the money. I wish they had chosen better casks and treated them more gently. The nose is also a bit too retiring for my preference.

It’s still a step up from the entry-level White Label but it fails to realize its full potential. A good mixer with soft drink where sugar balances the hard finish, but it doesn’t really stand up to neat tasting.

“Average” : 2.5 stars"

 Nose: The rather unique nose has notes of buttered toast, funnel cakes, alcohol, plum, basil leaves, sourdough bread, and a  slight note of cooked sausage brat.

Taste: The palate is nothing like the nose for me, notes of grapes, smoked cheese, cinnamon, roasted pear, and oak greet my tastebuds.

Finish: The finish is medium length, and starts off smooth and has a rising bitterness in the back of the throat and some peppery spice, as well as a tingling mouthfeel.

Thoughts: This is a decent scotch. It's not the best, but it isn't bad. I probably won't buy it again, but I'm glad I tried it and if it were offered to me, I would drink it with a smile! Sláinte!"

3.75,"Dewars is arguably one of the most widely known and best selling blended Scotch whiskies out there.  As the name suggests, the individual whiskies (both single malts and single grains) in the blend here are all aged a minimum of 12 years; however the final mixed blend is then aged again around 6 months to marry the flavors together.  Being admittedly still fairly new in the world of Scotch, what drew me to grab a bottle of this were the suggested predominant darker tasting notes of dark fruits and smoky (not a peaty smoke) chocolate milkshake, which just sounded delicious to me, but the modest price doesn't hurt much either.  Will it live up to my expectations or end up as just another forgettable Scotch blend?  Let's give it a go!

Enjoyed neat in a Glencairn, no added water.  On the nose I pick up honey, a nice mix of both fruity and floral bouquets and lastly and a hint of milk chocolate with a peppery spice.  At times the frutiness comes across as sweet apple turnovers drizzled in caramel with a side of vanilla cream, yet with subsequent smells I pick up some orange citrus. A light smokiness in the malt, but nothing resembling peat smoke, is detected on the nose.  All in all, quite a nice start inviting me for a taste.

On the palate, the initial feel is buttery yet on the thinner side with a strong surge of honey coming forward first with buttery toast. The sip is neither sweet or tart, but right up the middle.  Next up I get a wonderfully dark palate of milk and dark chocolate cake with light vanilla frosting, dark cherries and raisin, all mixed together with a nice smokiness and light spice here that I really really like.  It's not what I'd consider a peaty kind of smokiness, but a darker charred kind of smoke that honestly plays very well against the darker chocolate and fruit flavors.  And these darker flavors were exactly what drew me in to buy a bottle.   While the nose is layered and airy if a little light, the palate is dark and rich with a great smoothness and full flavor profile.  Honestly for a $30 blend, the Dewar's 12 is delicious!  I have no complaints on flavor for the price paid!

The finish is pretty short, unfortunately, and leaves toasted cereal with a lingering smoke way off in the distance, calling you to refresh those nice palate flavors.  A short but flavorful kick of spice and pepper finish off the taste.  Wish the flavor notes lingered a bit longer, but another sip always remedies the issue.

Overall, I must say, for a 12 year blended Scotch at the more than reasonable $30 price point, I really like this blend.  I greatly enjoyed the darker notes here, particularly the chocolate and char smoke dancing together.  At this price for a Scotch, most folks would likely be looking at either Dewar's 12, JW Black, or even the well respected Monkey Shoulder.  I really enjoyed the MS for its flavors, but it's flavor profile is entirely different, much lighter, malty, and more fruity citrus, no darker flavors, no char or peat smoke to speak of.   The JWB is slightly less complex or rich but has more of a light peaty smoke profile in comparison to the more char and chocolaty smokiness of the Dewar's.   While I look forward to continuing my Scotch and whiskey journey, I think this Dewar's will always occupy a space on the shelf for a tasty budget blend!  Cheers!"

3.25,"warm stone fruit. waxy, almost greasy, wood spices and fruit smoothness. Good neat, rocks, mixed. Charactered, but not unnecessarily so. RICH mouth feel. I have the tumbler (and ice sphere mold) they recommend it with from buying so much over the years but I promise it's best room temp neat. Pour the dram generous and notice how it opens so nicely sip after sip. Whenever I take a bottle to a party, it usually is this one. 

best blend for the money. easy choice when under $30usd. mine is $25 w tax."

1.5,@Rouge's tasting - veruit de minste
0.25,"Nose - Muted artificial sweet, light vanilla, watery corn syrup, not much there

Taste - Watery artificial sweet, light white pepper tingle, splenda/corn syrup grain cereal sweet, bitter bread?

Finish - Lingering splenda sweet, light bitterness, uncooked dusty grains

Score - 12/100

Final Thoughts - There's really not much to this one other than bleh. The nose is muted and not unpleasant, but that's only to surprise you with an unpleasant splenda generic sweet on the palate. There's maybe a hint of vanilla in there somewhere but it's so masked by this generic artificial sweetener vibe that even that can't save this dram. This has a bitter back end to it and transitions to a splenda-like sweet that I get from Crown Royal, except this is much worse.

Would I drink it if offered? - No

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - I don't know why anyone would"

3.5,"I actually believed that the 12 yo and the white label were the same Dewars. Actually, this one is a little better.

Bottled at 40%abv with an amontillado sherry color.

On the nose main notes are: vanilla, peat, caramel, honey, prunes, toasted bread sticks, pepper and cola. Very sweet aroma.

On the palate, tobacco, dry brown grass, hay, slight pepper, dim oakyness, with a honey finish very gentle and smooth.

Overall this is a 73 over a 100. Fair whisky."

3.25,"The good rating/awards and positive reviews combined with a sale price($15/375ml) convinced me to give this a shot. This has replaced the 12 yr Special Reserve in the Dewar's canon. I'm not a big fan of blends however this is quite a pleasant surprise. Poured neat, nice legs and unexpected soft creamy mouthfeel. Nose is malty and fruity with light smoke, mild vanilla and good depth. Palate is surprising strong delivery of malt, caramel dipped fruit, gentle smoke and wood. Sweet and smooth with no burn, nice and easy but very tasty. Miles ahead of Dewars White Label. Finishes with lasting maltiness, wood and char. Only 80 pf but does not seem watered down at all. Its not that complex but has solid hefty flavors with depth, Im impressed. Goes down easy and tastes great........85/100 blend score...would purchase again."
