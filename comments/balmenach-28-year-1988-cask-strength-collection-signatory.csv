4.75,"Rare Scotch Flight - Brandy Library
(Checking in for the 25 year)"
4.0,Balmenach Distillery officially opened in 1824 which makes in nearly 200 years old. In fact it was brewing as an illicit distillery before this so it prob has celebrated 200 year anniversary already. Apparently this is a rarity in single malt format as its highly in demand for blending. It's got the old worm tub profile which I like although initially I was like woah this is harsh...after a bit that characteristic turned into 'character'. Still to much of anything can be a bit much. Its a bit like Ledaig and Mortlach had a love child and this is the result. I...like it though. Definately a 3.75 which perhaps would go to a 4 if I had a whole bottle.
