2.0,"The Torfa I liked. This...This has very little going on. The Deanston Virgin, Inchgower 14 and others I tried whilst not memorable still were more interesting. Weirdly its got almost a sour note to it, gruelish almost and very little else. The refills that have been used here seem well past their prime and in the case of the sherry casks used for a micro second finish. Down the sink it goes..."

than the nose.  Much more wood and barrel impact on the palate.  cereal and malt as well as a slight grassy note on the finish"

1.0,"A little Carmel and toffee up front with unripe green apple, and grapes, slightly briney through the middle and a long hot finish. The more I taste it the more I dislike it, way overpriced, barely drinkable. It gets one star 
because it’s better than unaged grain alcohol, drink with water or ice."

3.5,You can taste that this was aged in a red wine barrel. If you like red wine and whisky you should try this whisky. Stronger notes of Toffee and caramel on the nose.

3.75,"On the nose: caramel, toffee, and cream are evident. This is followed by sweet honey, cream, and nutty taste on the palate. The finish is evident with some sweet and spice mixtures. Excellent for its price."

3.75,"Initial notes of red wine on the nose that evolves into more traditional sherry with raisins, caramel/salted caramel.  Strong sherry flavor.  It's got a strong caramel flavor on the palate.  It's got some decent smoke.

This is caramel through and through- the only fault I can really find is the body is not as thick as I like."

3.25,"Glenglassaugh Revival

Nose: malted cereal and a smokey honey, grape skins and sugar, woody earthy peat. 
Palate: rich, dense, and sweet. Dessert whiskey. Malt cereal and honey like on the nose, port wine sweetness with a wisp of smoke and vein of funky peat intertwined with the rich sweet wine notes and malt. There’s a busyness to it but it just holds together. Very interesting and a unique malt. 
The finish is short, musty sweet, with a tickle of barrel spice."
0.75,"Warning! This is strongly peated! I purchased a shooter to try first based on the main review and got an awful surprise of highly antiseptic taste. If you like peat, by all means. Otherwise, steer clear."

3.0,"Representing speyside deveron river

Nose: oak, wood, cream, distinctive, sweet, like a cream puff, ?acidic?, winey (red), I think the acid is really orange & citrus mixed with red wine. I don’t care for it. Very distant caramel. The nose is better from a distance. 

Body: smooth and creamy

Palate: orange stands out, then oak and caramel sweetness. It’s different. 

Finish: woody, way late an orange twangs which I thought was amazing. Later still bready, more orange cream, nice bourbon sweetness, not very warming though. 

Note: first sip had a lot going on. The nose had me a little concerned (the acid) but I think it is a strong orange nose. Overall I appreciate this dram but it’s not my style. The taste is better than the nose. I was excited for this one and a little let down it’s ok not good or great.  Certainly interesting. It has scored so highly but I think that must be the novelty of the flavor which again I appreciate its different but I don’t like different in this case. 

A second taste mixed with benriach curiositas was a no go. 

A third taste was different perhaps as the bottle breathed the weird red wine cream tamed down and it was more like a 3.25 than a 3. It was just better"

3.0,More smoke than expected. Tart and less complex than other Speysides. Sweeter after tastes.
3.75,Fun and interesting. Buttery. Was not expecting to get as much red wine cask as I did.

3.0,"Strong vanilla flavour, but the taste really did not excite much. You can feel the sea-side breeze in it and some seaweed notes...but the taste really is not so exciting. The version with Pedro Ximenez ending is muuuuch better and the price difference is not big."

3.5,A very nice dram at a good price point. Rich and malty with an amazing banana note!
2.0,"Glenglassaugh tasting evening, Sydney, Feb 19th. Whisky #2

Nose: Malt, cereal grains and cider vinegar (rather like fermenting wash). Dark honey and caramel. A dusty sawdust note along with a grape and red-fruit presence. There's a heaviness to the nose but also an astringent tang.

Palate: A resilient grassy arrival. Dark grains, semi-sweet nutty flavours, nutmeg. As it develops a spicy note grows with a warm ginger and cinnamon character, but the heat is controlled. A flavour of tart fruit like sour cherries also emerges. A dash of water emphasises the spice, taking it to more of a white pepper character. A slight tannic bitterness.

Finish: Medium. Cereal and spice fade out into a faint bitter aftertaste.

There is a definite red wine presence on both the nose and palate, but it's more in the background than the foreground, which remains distinctly malty. Coming back to this after tasting some of the later whiskies I noticed the sharp harshness of the profile.

Water opens this whisky up slightly, but on the whole achieves little. Not much else to say - this was by far the least interesting whisky of the night, and a long step down after the excellent first dram (Evolution). I certainly wouldn't buy a bottle.

""Acceptable"" : 2 stars"
5.0,"Tried this at whiskey washback. Great stuff. Rich of strawberries, spice, toffee, and chocolate."
3.0,Fruity nose with a bit of a sour note. Gentle arrival with tart fruit and a slight briny note through the middle. The finish is long and pleasantly warm. I want to like it more than I do. My sense is that the NAS means that there is some pretty young whisky in the mix that lends to the green/sour nose.

3.5,"I probably come to this one with high expectations, given that I think the Glenglassaugh Evolution (the only other Glenglassaugh I've tried) is lovely.  The grape is definitely prevalent. I really don't pick up the smoke at all.  Overall, it's reasonably full, not overly dry, and moderately sweet.  There's nothing bad I can say about it, but I didn't find any part of the experience to be particularly compelling. A nice whiskey, one I would never turn down, but the Evolution is unlikely to get a partner on my shelf."

Drink it with desert and you’re all set."

3.75,Very nice vanilla/sweet notes. Tastes almost like a wheat we bourbon
4.5,Absolutely delicious!! A must buy. Only had a sample from the dram club
3.75,"My Lord, the red wine is quite strong here! The first approach to the glass is of very clear red fruit, with an explosion of strawberries, blueberries, cherries, plums... sweet and sour, where sherry and wine team up to asphalt everything else on the nose. Digging in this fruity blanket, you can find some marzipan, nutmeg, dried dates, some hazelnuts. The influence of the barrels is very strong, quite too much.
And it's the sherry that dominates the palate, very pasty, with raisins infused in alcohol, cinnamon, a touch of pepper, dark chocolate, plums, light woody background. Warm and soft, but fairly flat and monotonous.
Medium finish, slightly ashy, spicy, of wine, cherries, wood.
Definitely the least interesting of the three NAS of the Glenglassaugh core range, the contribution of wine barrels disturbs the aromas on the nose and then practically fades on the palate, which remains in the wake of the thousands and  thousands sherried already on the market. Surely it is not to be thrown away, given the price, but it is largely negligible."
