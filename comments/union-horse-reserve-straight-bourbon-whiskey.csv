3.25,"""With cube
0-1.5: Disgusting. Worth only mixing or meeting the drain. 
2: Bad. Drinkable, but majorly flawed 
2.5: Sub-par. OK, but bland or somewhat flawed. 
3: Good. Decent stuff, but I won’t be rushing to buy it 
3.5: Very good. I’d love to keep a bottle around
4: Excellent. I would like to own a case. A go to for me that is worthy of celebrating 
4.5: Incredible.Truly high end, elite level, very noteworthy
5: Sublime. Nearly perfect and an all time favorite"

3.5,"Smells of cherry. Harsh finish, with a flavor that begs to be paired with sweetness."

2.0,really spicy
2.0,"Batch 16 Bottle 752 - Medium legs in glass.  Sniffer is shot, totally dead today, I'm afraid.  Front is all honey with a little grass, middle brings out the vanilla and rye bread and cloves.  Finish brings smoke, a little white pepper, and a little oak.  Very short.  Mouth feel is very thin, nothing to chew here.
    
    Not quite sweet enough for my wife, no where near spicy enough for me.  This will end up being a mixer bottle for us.  I have a later batch that I will open and review when this one is done."

3.75,Nice for a younger bourbon. Strong vanilla finish.
3.25,"Not great, not bad - overall strong flavor of cherries and not in a bad way."
