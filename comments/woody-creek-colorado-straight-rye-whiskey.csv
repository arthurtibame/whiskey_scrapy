4.0,"Nose: orange, leather, black pepper. Palate: strong black pepper with a long finish that fades into cinnamon. Adding water pulled togehter the flavors in the nose and brought forth a nice pickle brine taste. The palate and finish were a little muted, but I got the brine there too. Overall: not terribly complex, but wonderful nonetheless!"

4.0,"Smooth tasting rye. Nice aroma... sweet almost like a bourbon.  There is a hint of pine on the palate 

Purchased at Campana"

2.0,"Fruity and flowery on the nose, it's the best smelling whisky I've ever had. That scent is replicated exactly in the taste, which is not to say I like it. The flowery/fruity aroma translates poorly and is too intense in the taste. Reminds me of bathroom soap. It's not a good flavor. 2/5 stars."

4.25,Nose of mint. Sweet mint on the palate. This is excellent rye that tastes spicy but without smacking you in the face with it.

0.5,Tastes like popcorn and way too sweet. Obviously enzymes used to ferment and tastes too sweet to be just rye.

3.75,Very light and floral. If I blind tested this I wouldn’t think it was a rye! Delicious though.

4.0,I met the owner at a bar in Vail. I promised to buy a bottle and I did. I like it very much.
5.0,"Another Colorado only pour I sampled this week during a business trip.  This one was really good...for a mashbill of 100% rye, I guess I expected something really spicy and hot, maybe like biting directly into a rye seed itself.  I was wrong...incredibly floral and light, almost as if there was wheat in there.  For $6/pour, highly recommended!  I’ll be looking for a bottle during my next visit here"

4.5,"Really enjoyed this. Was suggested by my favorite bartender and the suggestion was spot on.  Bright Orange/copper in color. Nose of cedar, lemon, touch of mint and Rye notes.  Flavor also a bit floral, citrus (Lemon) with black pepper towards finish. Touch oily which is nice.  Vibrant but rounded and not gritty.  Like it a lot"
