2.5,Very sweet. Drink with coke.
4.0,"I love this!  With the vanilla and the molasses added, when enjoyed neat I get a funky rum vibe, almost a black strap rum.  I like rum, so I'm okay with that. But this isn't meant to be enjoyed neat.  The reason I would give it a 4 is because it is perfect with cola as at the restaurant.  Here's why I'm going to be buying more of this juice: 2.5 ounces in a cocktail shaker with ice, 4 dashes of bitters, stir for one minute, pour into a cold rocks glass, add a cherry.  No vermouth needed.  This is absolutely ideal as a Manhattan.  Well done!"

0.25,This isn’t bourbon. Tastes like they poured a jar of cherry juice in there. Garbage

2.5,"This year for the holidays I’m going to try a brand new whiskey every day in December. #lifegoals

Dec. 6:

Note - this is not 88%, it’s 88 proof. 88% would be... hot damn.

So how would you interpret “Straight Bourbon Whiskey with Dark Cherry and Bourbon Vanilla Beans”? It’s the only designation on the bottle, and it feels misleading. My hope is those are tasting notes. My fear is that this is a damn mixed drink in a bottle.

Nose: holy cow the cherry. Reminds me of a cherry wine. Very sugary. Not looking good folks.

Body: jack and cherry coke. Mic drop.

Finish: coke, sugar, cinnamon.

It’s really hard to pick out bourbon. It’s a damn mixed drink in a bottle. It’s pretty good, and if I were a fan of jack and coke, I think this would be amazing. There’s a really weird carbonated mouth feel in the finish. It’s not carbonated from the shake test, but I think it’s just so reminiscent of a mixed drink that my brain is fooled.

Directions on the back for “Elmo Cola”:
1) Fill rocks glass with ice.
2) Add 2oz St. Elmo Bourbon (bullshit, this is not bourbon)
3) Fill glass with cola
4) Garnish with 2 cherries.

Honestly you could skip steps 3&4 and be just fine. It’s good, but not a bourbon.

I don’t know if I actually have 25 more new whiskeys lined up, so if you’re reading this and there’s something readily available out there you’d like me to enjoy/suffer through this holiday season, leave it in the comments."
