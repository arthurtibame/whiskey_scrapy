5.0,"Bottle no 58 out of only 600 – produced in October 1997. Entirely matured in a fresh sherry barrel for over 17 years and bottled at cask strength - 58.5%.   

Taste - Thick, oily and mouth-filling. Chewy and spicy with some more rum-like touches. Flavours of roasted nuts, caramel toffees, liquorice, orange peel, old oak, Oloroso sherry, leather and dark chocolate.  
Finish - Very long with a rich spiciness. 

Beautiful thick and fruity. Best in its class that Ive tasted.
