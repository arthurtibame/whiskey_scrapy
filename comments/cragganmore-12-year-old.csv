3.25,"Sweet, GRAINY sugary stuff, MOLASSES. Mildly Smoky,but the sweetness might as well make it Irish. Prickly, Christmas-y potpourri; heavily spiced. Some earthy business. The peat is overshadowed by the grainy sugars."

3.75,"If you’re looking for a candied single malt that starts off with a bourbon-like nose and finishes with a flourish of smoke, look no further. 

Nose:  buttery biscuits, hints of brine, corn, almonds and vanilla 

Taste: citrus zest, honey and vanilla

Finish: medium — a quick hit of spice at the end and a nice introduction to a smoky Speyside with that peat smoke at the end"

2.5,"1L bottle, 1/2 full

Nose: banana, honey, sugar
Taste: thin apple pie
Finish: medium length, apple is the main takeaway. 

Value: There are better Scotches out there for less. Will not replace."
3.5,"Appearance: golden color, low viscosity

Nose: delicate, sweet smoke, ripe banana

Palate: sweet, salty, bitter with a medium long sweet finish. Medium to high complexity 

Fruit character comes out with the addition of water"
3.25,"Nose: orchard fruits, then honey. Second whiff picks up peat, then smoke. Light, fruity, pears and apples, lightly peated, coats your tongue like honey."

3.0,"Carmel apple, sweet, thin taste, easy to drink.Has a slight floral smell and taste."
4.0,"Vanilla smoothness and some nutmeg up front, then a moderate black pepper barges in still with vanilla crema. Has a subtle warmth, but in no way hot, this drinks well, and has a good peat, but it doesn't hold up to a single malt, a bit mild overall."

4.0,"Smooth, with tasty bourbon-cask notes.  Not superior to other bourbon-casked scotches in the $60-$75 USD range.  And not crazy different, either.  But it does have this fantastic pineapple note at the finish.  Unique and memorable.
