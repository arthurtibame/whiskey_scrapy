5.0,Had the privilege of tasting from bottle #27077 at the distillery. This whisky is by far the smoothest & best tasting whisky I’ve ever had.

5.0,"Normally I steer clear of Sherry cask whiskeys, so this one made me nervous.  My expectations were shattered with a delicious balance of fruit and flavor I could drink all day. If you have the opportunity to try this, don't pass it up."

5.0,This is sherry over sherry and you can taste the earthiness of the barrels. Had the privilege of having Bottle 24279 at the distillery. Just totally outstanding yet different as I've not had experience such strong sherry infusion into my palate.

5.0,"Perfection is an illusion - but this Japanese masterpiece of a sherry bomb certainly comes very close to it (bottle no. 11218). The nose of Yamazaki 25 is overwhelmingly complex and heavy with overripe strawberries, red roses, raisins, dried figs and a touch of old leather. After a sweet arrival, the taste gets peppery and mildly dry with Christmas spices, cloves and ginger. This whisky was matured in first-class sherry casks, leading to a long and aromatic finish with some delicate hints of coffee and cocoa. A stellar Single Malt with quality from start to finish.

RATING: 4.9/5.0 stars ≙ 94 pts → PERFECT [-]"

5.0,"Dark cherry fruits. It needs that 25-30 minute airing out time and the nose does change it. I feel like it’s the Yamazaki distillery’s attempt at macallan-style type of sherry cask finishes and it is extremely nice. I wish I had a bottle of it that didn’t cost so darn much (2900 yen for a shot or $60,900 yen per bottle)"
