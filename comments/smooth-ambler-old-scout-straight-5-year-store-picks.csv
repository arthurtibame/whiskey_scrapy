4.5,"Neat. Neck pour. OHLQ pick 3 of 5.  Lots of cinnamon and clove lead the nose, gives way to a nice charred caramel and a hint of cherry.  Pie crust and vanilla begin creeping out over time.  Slight hint of green leaves.  

Syrupy on the tongue, really costs the mouth.  Cinnamon sugar up front and wow it is brighter than I was expecting.  This barrel really pops.  Lights up with a rich cherry and waves of vanilla.  The caramel is coming on strong with subsequent sips and the legs are that pie crust.  Starting to get a nice Apple note well into the legs too.  Really stretches out.

This one is very yummy.  I’ve had a few of these store picks but I don’t recall the initial flavors kicking in the teeth like this one.  Really enjoying these 5 year picks."
