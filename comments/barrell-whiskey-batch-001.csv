3.0,"The high proof prevents a deep analysis of the nose. But definitely smells sweet. And... definitely tastes sweet. This is a sugar bomb. Not off putting, but not as complex initially as I was expecting.  It opens up though. Spice, honey, some fruit, some fingernail polish remover. Works for me. Looking forward to seeing how this bottle changes over time. 2/18/17.
A week later, which probably isn't enough time for too many material changes to be noted. The nose has a bit more fruit (zest?) than I remember, and on the backend of the palate I get a little nutmeg and bitterness. But otherwise, the same as before - sweet, spicy, a bit of acetone. Warm going down. A bit thinner and less complex than the Barrell Bourbons, which are just fantastic and to me worth their premium prices, but this Whiskey is a winner as well. 2/25/17"

4.25,"I saw this thinking it was a good deal on Barrell Bourbon, but then later saw it was actually their Whiskey. Batch 001. Not sure what to expect, so let’s check it out.

It does seem fairly light looking for being 7-8 years at barrell strength. I guess it’s the already used bourbon barrels that have already washed away a decent amount of char.

The nose is fairly soft, but the flavors are there. You just need to experiment with slowly bringing the nose to the glass to pick up some notes that are missed when digging into the glass.
I get honey, vanilla cream, a little bit of oak and some baking spices. There’s also a hint of a raisin back in there.

The palate is sweet and oily. There is vanilla, oak, a little leather and a spike of baking spices in the middle. 

The finish is long with nice lingering vanilla bean ice cream. There is a burn, to be expected from the proof, but as Ron Burgandy says “It’s a good burn”.

I like this one. I found that I had to search a little harder on the nose than most at this proof. But the palate jumped out and it had a nice, unique vanilla finish."
