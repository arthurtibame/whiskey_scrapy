5.0,"I'm fairly certain this is an unpeated expression of Bunnahabhain but the first thing that stood out to me upon trying this was the immediate smoke present in the background; it's not an intense, peaty smoke, but it's definitely there in some small quantity as the whisky hits your palate. It certainly is a sweet dram, but sherry spiciness and high ABV do a fair job of balancing the molasses/dark fruit flavors out. This could probably pass for an antique Caribbean rum to someone without an experienced palate. I would probably save this as an evening/dessert dram, not so much because of the sweetness but rather because of the INTENSE punch it packs on your palate."

4.5,"Sweet, full bodied, smooth"
5.0,"Nose- Candied raisins, fig jam, stewed dark fruits, red licorice, honey roasted nuts, lavender 

Palate- sweet honey-syrup initially, rich dark fruits, licorice, fig jam, sugary toffee, strawberry jam

Finish- Long, syrupy finish with delicious notes of honey covered nuts, strawberry jam, and sherry sweetness

A.Maze.Ing. My oh my. People say this is “liquid desert” and that is completely right. If you’re not a fan of sweet whiskies this one won’t be for you, but I absolutely love it."

The spices balance the brown sugar flavors, making for a satisfying dessert dram or nightcap that would pair well with a robe and slippers."
