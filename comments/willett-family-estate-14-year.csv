5.0,"Wow, just wow. This is amazing stuff if you can find it. Finish that goes on for hours and a complexity that’s hard to explain. Mint, butterscotch(like I have never experienced in a bourbon), baking spices and incredibly smooth but full of flavor and complexity at the same time. My favorite bourbon right now, wish I could find more."
