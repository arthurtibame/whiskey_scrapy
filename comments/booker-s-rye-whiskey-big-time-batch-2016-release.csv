4.0,"Pretty damn good and not what I would expect from Beam--where's the peanuts? Deep, rich oak and sweet, thick brown sugar. I don't pick out any typical herbal notes associated with an older rye and, given in a double blind, I would probably call this a bourbon. Beam was smart to jack up the retail, but I wouldn't pay more than $70 for what it is."

null,"Nose: Oranges, saltine crackers, light Carmel
Palette: OAK, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, brown sugar
Finish - looooong dry oak spice and cedar. 

This “rye” delivers the highly sought after tannic oak bomb flavor that lingers; It’s nice and all but IMO it doesn’t quite hold up to the aura and ultra inflated 2nd market price- ...but, what really does?"

P - sweet cherries followed by spices, typical Booker’s heat
F - nice smooth finish with a little bite going down

Beautiful rye, my favorite. Do not ever pass down the opportunity if given - these aren’t around for much longer"

4.75,"Stunning rye. One of my all time favorites. First time I've ever agreed with the critics on ""whiskey of the year"" as well.

Tried this for the first time at a bar down in Texas before the hype hit. Was stunned by it--and had the chance to share it with a friend who had never tasted a rye before... it is just incredible whiskey. Goes down like it's half it's proof.... however, it does need a while to open up. Second time I had it was from a freshly opened bottle, and it wasn't nearly as good.

Opens up well and needs a few weeks/months of being open to fully reach it's potential.

This compares favorably to others of the all-time great ryes I've tried--the Saz 18, Thomas Handy 2013, Willett special releases like Iron Fist and Velvet Glove, old High West 21 year bottles, etc. It deserves to be in the same company, and that's the highest praise I can give it.

There are other, better cask strength ryes out there--but none I know of that can be bought for any remotely reasonable sum of money. And I know that Booker's rye, at a secondary of $800, is similarly crazy. But at the ~$300 retail, it's worth it, and a far cry better than most other special release ryes of the past few years."

5.0,"Incredible, hot, spicy and delicious. With a big, long finish. A few drops of water at the end of the glass really opened it up, this was an incredible pour."
5.0,"Nose - Sweet. Chocolate. Corn.
Taste - Spicy. Pickle juice for just a second .Easy to sip for 68%. Corn sweetness comes through.

Could drink the whole bottle and not realize it."

4.25,Blind Barbour!  Thanks to “Smalls” for the heavy pour.
5.0,Thick and chewy. Intense oak and rye. Rich luxurious mouth feel.
4.0,It acts and tastes like a high rye bourbon with the Booker’s profile and finish. Lacks the punch of the rye spices for the proof.
5.0,Simply the best!!!
5.0,This much heat but not a crazy burn. Can still taste it five min later. Once in a lifetime experience.

5.0,"A friend of mine acquired this bottle from a colleague who simply had no idea what it was,  fortunately it wound up in the hands of some ""professionals"" that could appreciate it!   Luckily I was able to get 3 full shots as the owner was not being too stingy. 

From the top it was apparent there is nothing ""usual"" about this bottle, the richness in spices on the nose, the heat all the way down and smooth follow through, all are unique in this from the shear potency to the incredibly smooth finish packed into the 136 proof juice.   Bookers Rye is a clear example of why you can't hurry perfection, and what proper aging means to  the finished product.   Anyone who is a Bookers fan, a rye fan or both is going to be able to appreciate this incredible treat to some degree.  

The Bookers label with green print makes in abundantly clear you aren't looking at normal Bookers so when you see this bottle do not hesitate, as they are becoming more scarce by the day."
