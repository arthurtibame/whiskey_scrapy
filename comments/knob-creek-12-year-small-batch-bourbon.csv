4.0,"Really like the Jim Beam profile, knob creek was always a good solid go to but that changed with this whiskey. The age statement is back and they aren't at 9 they upped it to 12. This whiskey changes multiple times through out an evening as it opens up which is always great because you don't drink the same whiskey twice. Nose is sweet caramel, vanilla, a bit of brown sugar. Cherry is your fruit note, barrel and rye spice round it out. Let it open up and you get more honey, nice baking spices, cinnamon and apple with a sweet pie crust note true apple pie in a glass. Taste is classic bourbon, sweet, cherry, honey, caramel, it's knob creek so the rye and barrel spices show up early and loud but calm down quick with a vanilla surge too. Let it open up with time and you get cherry, honey, even more vanilla, peaches, and corn syrup on the taste.  Finish is kind of short for such a bourbon with an age statement like this but it's sweet, oak, fruit and honey as long as it lasts. The finish doesn't really change the more it opens up except that you get less oak wood notes and more vanilla cream the longer it sits. Really nice bourbon and a nice age statement at a fair to good price."

1.0,"Nose - dusty corn, peanuts, some caramel, and dusty oak. 

Taste - The taste is a bit sweeter than the nose, but there's still that beam profile of peanuts, dusty corn, a lot of caramel, and oak. 

So I don't get this. The 9 year single barrel is really good whisky. The standard small batch is actually pretty good. But every time they bottle something officially with more age, they want to showcase everything beam does wrong. That nutty beam character is nice when it's subtle. Instead the salted peanuts overwhelm the bourbon character, it's oak and nuts. Why?

We know for a fact that they have massive amounts of outstanding barrels, these 9 year store picks have been getting rave reviews, but as soon as beam blends together batches, we get absolute crap. 

I've been working on this one for a few weeks, kept putting off reviewing it due to sometimes think it is too hot, other times thinking I'm off. I wasn't and it is. This is just another poor effort from beam. Whoever is doing their blending should be replaced. 

That said, this isn't complete a disaster. It's a 1 star whisky, quality components but unless you're obsessed with that beam profile, avoid it. It's over priced to add insult to injury."

4.25,"Nose is complex with dried Fuji apple, spearmint, prune, pine, chocolate, and blueberry.

On the palate opens with caramel, cinnamon, clove, anise, and a general yet subtle kind of nuttiness like what you’d find in pine nuts as opposed to the “peanut funk” like some JB products. 

Finish: Oh the finish! Prune, barrel char, pepper, more anise, and oak. Medium length but the blend is divine. 

Mouthfeel is full and oily. 100 proof makes itself known with a pleasant mouth tingle. 

Overall I really enjoyed this. The extra 3 yrs definitely makes itself known in all sorts of ways. Even my bourbon hating wife loves this. At $57, a definite rebuy."

4.0,"Nose- apple and oak
Palate- slight initial pepper. Cherry followed by slight dark chocolate. slight oak.
Finish- Short. Oak and nuts into hints of apples."
3.0,"BACKGROUND: Knob Creek first hit the market in 1992 when Jim Beam Master Distiller Booker Noe wanted to produce a premium, small batch bourbon that was similar to pre-Prohibition standards.  Today, it stands alongside Booker’s, Baker’s, and Basil Hayden as part of Jim Beam’s premium collection.

When Beam experienced a shortage of fully-aged bourbon in 2015 - 2016, the company removed the traditional nine year age statement from Knob Creek bottles.  

After increasing production and allowing existing stocks to mature, Beam re-entered the age statement market with this 12 year expression.  The nine year age statement recently returned to bottles of the basic Knob Creek offering, as well.  

Knob Creek is named for an actual creek that runs through the site of the boyhood farm upon which President Abraham Lincoln was raised.  Throughout adulthood, Lincoln referred to his boyhood home as “the Knob Creek place” to discern it from the nearby farm upon which he was born.  

It is believed that Lincoln’s father, Thomas, worked as a seasonal hand at a local distillery, and the future president, himself, sold bourbon in a general store that he owned and operated in New Salem, Illinois with business partner William Berry.

Knob Creek 12 Year is made from a mashbill of 75% corn, 13% rye, and 12% barley, and it retails for $60 a bottle.

NOSE: The nose is full of the traditional Beam funk, which I love and enjoy, along with earthy tobacco, oak, peanut shells, and undertones of caramel toffee.

PALATE: The palate contains orange citrus, oak, molasses, and a unique and muted sweetness that immediately brings dark rum to mind.  The bourbon itself is viscous and syrupy and takes its time getting from point A to point B.

FINISH: The orange citrus on the palate transitions into more of a grapefruit flavor on the finish, and it is joined by a burst of cinnamon.  Heavy oak tannins linger in the back of the throat.  The finish is a long one with just a touch of warmth that seems to last forever.

FINAL ASSESSMENT:  I will preface this assessment by acknowledging that I am a sucker for Jim Beam’s high-end, premium offerings and also its more limited products like Bonded, Distiller’s Cut, and Double Oak, so Knob Creek 12 Year should settle right into my wheelhouse.

On the other hand, I have been privy to purchasing several Knob Creek store picks that are 120 proof, carry a 15 year age statement, and cost about $40.  In other words, I can easily purchase higher-proofed, longer-aged Knob Creeks for about $20 less per 750ml. 

At the same time, Elijah Craig Barrel Proof is aged for the same length as this Knob Creek, is proofed almost 40 points higher, and comes in at the same price point.  It is also a much superior bourbon, and the C919 batch earned one of my highest ratings.

The Knob Creek 12 Year is a perfectly average, plain-jane bourbon - not bad, but also not fantastic.  Given the similar - and often better - options available at the same price or lower, I would likely opt for one of those next time."

3.75,"Color is a dark copper, lots of legs after a swirl

Nose - Oak, leather, dark brown sugar, red apple, orange, roasted nuts, a bit of ethanol.

Palate - Roasted peanuts, oak, burnt caramel, vanilla, cinnamon and baking spices. The vanilla, spices and oak continue on the moderate finish along with some drying tannins. I wouldn't say the mouthfeel is thin, but it's also not thick or oily.

This will inevitably get compared to the 120 proof KC store picks, which can be anywhere from 9-15 years and are $10-15 cheaper. This is different, less oily/rich, a bit drier; but I would also say more complex than the single barrels tend to be. Not necessarily better or worse, just different. 

One thing this expression should have going for it is consistency due batching;  I've had some great KC single barrel picks, but some of them have been pretty meh, and I think some of those older picks are from barrels that weren't in the best warehouse locations, and Beam doesn't know what else to do with them.  

It's temping to ding this 12 year on value compared to the KC single barrel picks, but really it's hard to argue that it's overpriced for a 12-year 100 proofer compared to the rest of the market."

The oaky flavors continue through to a medium finish that bring a lingering warmth to the gut.  Overall, I can definitely appreciate this one, but I’m learning that I prefer less oak, maybe younger bourbons."

4.5,"I lucked up on my first bottle when I went to Los Angeles to see family and friends. I'm admittedly a huge Knob Creek fan, but this expression totally surprised me and immediately became my favorite."
3.75,"Freshly opened bottle - the nose is immediately oak, creme brûlée and earthy notes resemble the of the Beam peanut shell funk.  There’s a tickle of ethanol as well but not the eye burning single barrel effect being 20 proof lower.

No sting up front, just soft oak and sweetness with heat and a bit of candies cherries and slight cinnamon kick on the end (which more closely resembles the mid-palate 9 year age statement single barrel).

It has more of the floral, oak and leather tones than its 9yr age statement sibling.  For the price I think I prefer the heat and spice of the younger sib but this is still a good sipper and likely take enough to please the masses.  For the price would take Bookers any day of the week though."
4.25,"I just noticed I never posted a review of this Bourbon and it's steadily become a favorite of mine! I first purchased a bottle back in January, like many I was super skeptical of this release. While it carries a big age statement, it's not uncommon to find Knob Creek Store Picks going up to 15yrs in age for around the same price point or even less. However, to overlook this release because of the perceived poor value is a big mistake. Knob Creek clearly understood they had to craft a flavor profile that was unique yet still complex and that it had to be damn tasty. You know what, they did just that! Let's dive into the review...

The entry is surprisingly approachable yet mouthcoating. Right off the bat you know this is a different Knob Creek... The brute force entry is gone and I love the more restrained approach... Initial notes are honey, peanut brittle, vanilla and pralines... Next up oak and cigar box with a lovely warming baking spice backbone...  the finish is satisfying with orange peel, burnt brown sugar and cinnamon dusted nuts... Classic Bourbon. 

This is an excellent addition to the Knob Creek lineup and honestly is better than most of the oak heavy and in your face single barrel picks. Similar to Four Roses and their Small Batch Select release, the issue here isn't that this is a poor value it's that the Single Barrels are an outstanding value. Do yourself a favor and give this one a chance, you will be surprised at how much you like it! Cheers All!"

4.5,"Wow!

Just by swirling this in a Glencairn glass I can see that it has a lot of body as it takes quite awhile for the legs to develop.

On the first nose, beyond the initial sweetness of the corn, I'm picking up chocolate, dark cherries, hints of vanilla and what seems like very mild cream in the background.

The mouthfeel is very rich and creamy, has a wonderful amount of spice, tastes of the chocolate & cherries from the nose and finishes just beautifully.  Warm, long, full and the spiciness is so nice.

Just after the first few noses and sips, I can easily say that this is one of the best bourbons I've tasted so far.  Worth every penny of the $55 I paid for it at a local liquor store in the Phoenix Metro area.

Again...Wow!

I just added a little water, as I usually do when tasting something for the first time.  Upon nosing again, the sweet corn has become dusty corn, there is sweet barrel spice coming through and the chocolate, cherry and cream notes have gone way into the background.

Even just this small amount of water really took away from the flavor and finish too.  Still very full bodied but not nearly as bold.  I will definitely not be adding any water to future pours...like the refill that is probably coming in a few minutes!"

4.0,"tldr: I don’t know if I’d pay more than retail for this (about $65 in KY) but it’s definitely good at its price point especially considering the lack of 12-year options on the shelves. 

Nose: sweet honey, raisins, cinnamon, hunts of grass and hay...oak finally comes in at the end but it’s by no means an oaky bourbon even at 12 years. 

Taste: spicy nutmeg and other baking spices, hint of peppercorn and one last hint of honey 

Finish: medium finish, very little bite 

This reminds me a lot of Old Forester 100, which is way cheaper and super easy to find. It just doesn’t have the complexity of the OF100. But both are excellent bourbons."

4.25,"My brother and I split this bottle during quarantine. We also bought Four Roses Small Batch Select 2 weeks prior so I had the opportunity to compare both of these new $60 bottles in terms of value.

Rich, dense sweetness is prominent on the nose. A creamy nut butter with caramel, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a little vanilla added to the mix. For 100 proof the ethanol nose is almost non-existent, in contrast with the KC Small Batch where I get much hotter oak and ethanol. On the tongue the caramel and cinnamon hit first, followed by tannic oak and baking spices. I get some dry, leathery notes as well from the tannins. The finish is medium and oily, and surprisingly the tannic flavors on the back end of the tongue disappear quickly. For me what's notable about this bourbon is I get no fruit flavors whatsoever aside from hints of citrus peel. If I got a little dark fruit sweetness I may have rated it higher.

I know they're not similar products, but Four Roses and Knob Creek added two permanent $60 bottles in the last year. I've bought both in the last 3 months, and I think the Knob Creek 12Y is a better buy than the Four Roses SB Select. You get a high age statement, almost the same proof, and a marked improvement over the standard Small Batch bottle. The flavors are richer with this one."

4.25,"Bottle has been open for a few weeks and the profile seems to have changed a bit.  Now mirrors the 9yr age statement Mexican fried ice cream-cinnamon flare with less ethanol and more oak.  Definitely an easier sipper than the 120 proof.  Probably worth the $20 premium over 9yr statement but would likely still take a comparable age in a barrel pick instead and save a few dollars.  On the plus side it’s widely available - but then again so is bookers which gives a longer finish and richer mouthfeel.  Regardless, this is dang good and I regret nothing."
4.5,"Knob Creek 12 year was originally a limited edition, but due to popularity it has been added to the Knob Creek line. Its age statement is not seen on many bourbons now-a-days and is something to cherish. This 12 year single barrel is nothing but consistent and of the upmost quality for a less than premium price. Bottled at 100 proof/50%ABV, this bourbon is matured for 12 long years in KY by Jim Beam. The mashbill consists of 75% Corn, 13% Rye, and 12% Malted Barley.  Knob Creek 12 year continues to surprise me and deliver on quality bourbon. For its price, this is an amazing bourbon that can be enjoyed time and time again.

Color: Brown Sugar Gold

On the nose are rich aromas of fresh brownies, brown sugar, butter, vanilla, all spice, and cookie dough. The palate is just a tad bit too spicy with hints of rye spice, dark chocolate, biscuits, charred oak, and cloves. The finish is long and warming within some lingering spices and slight hints of leather and oak."

Pours into the glencairn a nice mahogany. The age is definitely evident in the color. Clings nicely to the sides of the glass before forming skinny slow legs.

NOSE: Heavy Oak/Barrel Spice. Sticky Burnt Sugar. Fall Spices-Cinnamon, Clove, Cardamom. Dry Roast Peanuts. A little heat. Simple, but definitely Not Subtle.
NEAT:  WOW. A sledgehammer to the palate. An immediate Burst of Heat. Mouthfeel is Thick and Clingy. Much like the nose, Simple but far from Subtle. Lots of Oak. Heavy Vanilla, Karo Syrup, Tingly Black Pepper, and Cinnamon. A Medicinal Cherry along the sides of the tongue and cheeks. Long, Drying Finish with a deep KY Hug. Heavy Oak coating and layering on the palate. Drinks like a Barrel Proof.
SPLASH: A little water adds Floral and Lemony Citrus notes to the nose. The Medicinal Cherry note becomes a little more prominent on the palate and the Heat is turned down a notch or two. The Oak takes on a more ""Musty"" quality.

VERDICT: Is the 3 extra years over the newly released KC 9YR worth an extra $20? My first impression is YES. This is my favorite KC release to date. It straddles the line between oaky and astringent very well. I think I liked it a little more than the standard 9YR Single Barrel, and can understand now the love for some of their older store picks. This is just very good bourbon."
