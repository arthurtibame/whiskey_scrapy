🏁: Finish is a bit hot, but a few drops of water does wonders here. Long and nutty finish, with some oak on the back end, which is surprising considering the age.

I truly cannot wait to see what Litchfield does with their current stock. This stuff at 8-10 years will be liquid gold. It’s an incredibly enjoyable pour now at around 3 - 4 years old. Despite the youth, the flavor is deep and rich. Keep this in a barrel for another 5-7 years and the sky is the limit. I will continue to seek this out as is, but will be waiting patiently when they start releasing some older juice!"
