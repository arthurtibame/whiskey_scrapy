0.25,Absolute dog shit. Will go down in history as the worst whiskey I’ve ever tasted that didn’t kill me.

0.5,One of the worst bourbons I’ve had. And I’ve had my fair share. The nose is not terrible but the taste is more of children’s medication than whiskey. Stay away.

4.5,Magic bbq burnt ends pork goodness. Tastes like lagavulin with slightly less peat plus bourbon plus rye
5.0,Peat meets Bourbon. Newest addition to my top shelf.

3.75,"Nose: peated scotch with vanilla bourbon
Taste: nice smoke without the medicinal note
Finish: dry, smoke lingers
After reading reviews: apparently I missed a lot beyond the smoke"

3.75,"I actually like the MGP version better.  This is unbalanced.  I know it’s supposed to be sweet and Smokey, but the sweet was never as cloying as thisnomsks"

3.5,"Sweet and smooth for a Rye. Maybe a hint of smoke on the finish. But pretty consistent all the way through.

4.0,"nose is a fair amount of smoke, with some vanilla and cinnamon.  taste is a good cross between bourbon and peated Scotch.  dark chocolate with some citrus, smoke at the end. finish is fairly long and a bit oily.  very fun blend."

3.5,The peat in this takes a little adjustment. Nice dram.

3.0,"Kinda interesting. Nowhere near as smoky as it started. Sweet, simple. Bit of dark chocolate and juniper. I like to drink this mindlessly. Not something I’m gonna discuss or spend a lot of time on mentally."
3.5,"Slightly more spice than I like, a touch of heat, great smokiness- more than subtle but not over bearing"

1.25,Horrible. Worst whiskey I’ve ever had.
3.25,"Mild smoke...more like a lighter than a campfire.   Some people comparing this to scotch or a peated scotch obviously has not enjoyed whisky across the ocean.   Scotch it is not, but it is a bourbon moving in the right direction."

4.0,Wish it were smoker actually. And that that smoke would have much longer legs. “Campfire” implies something different to me.

4.5,"Nose: Cherries, smoke, herbal mint, red licorice, cigar ash, stewed fruits, pixie sticks.

Taste: Sweet cherry, ash, baking spices, cinnamon, nutmeg, taaaad mint or anise. 

Experience:  A fall/winter party with great food and multiple fires, indoors you have a fireplace with fruits and pastries set about. The smells are sweet and warm. You walk outside into the cold and the sweet smells drop off into ashy darkness. But as you draw close to the heat of the outdoor fire pit the warmth comes back and you take another bite of the goodies you brought from inside. 

Notes: This was talked up to me as a fan of all types of whiskey. So I went in skeptical, but it is a fantastic blend for someone like me who enjoys bourbon, Scotch, Rye, and everything in-between. 
If you hate smoke, or rye, I have no clue how you will react to this. But I love all whiskey and this is a perfect paring of multiple genres, like The Princes Bride or Back to the Future III, it's not for everyone but if you like each part, you'll like them all mixed together."

4.0,"The nose at first is peaty, but oak, vanilla and rye come up behind it, while aromas of lit cigars, tobacco and charred meat linger. The peatiness carries over to the palate and is joined by oak, cola syrup, vanilla, tobacco and smoke. The finish is long with fading peat, smoke, vanilla, cola and oak. Unique!"
4.0,"I poured this and let it sit for twenty minutes before I smelled it. The smoke was nearly gone, and it gave way to sweet aromas of caramel, dark chocolate, and a bit of cinnamon. 

Palate is similar with a slight taste of sitting by a campfire on a fall evening."
0.25,"One of the worst bourbons I’ve had. Honestly, it is."
4.5,"I am firmly convinced Willy Wonka now works at High West. This whisky takes you on a flavor journey that few others will... or even attempt to. 

The nose has an immediate sweetness of rye and fig with hints of orange zest. The sweetness gives way to a nice dusty corn nite, finishing with a beautiful earthy smoke note. 

The palate kicks off with a welcoming sweetness akin to a rye or a dessert-y bourbon. Notes of apricot and walnut pop in the middle and just like the nose would suggest, finishes with a masterful hint of hardwood smoke, not peat smoke, campfire smoke. Go figure...

Reasonably long and grippy finish leaves you with a nice hint of sweetness perfectly balanced against the smokiness. An exquisite whiskey with few downsides. Definitely pick one up on your next trip to the store."

5.0,"I’ve reviewed this one already on the old Distiller page for the earlier edition of this and my original review holds up. This is what I said previously:

”This is without a doubt one of the most unique and tasty whiskeys I’ve ever tried. Due to the multi-national composition of the blend, it’s hard to pin down as one type. Imagine the taste of a bourbon with the complex spicy mid-palate of a rye with the smoky finish of an Islay or Island. The perfect desert dram and something perfectly unique for your collection!""

I would add to that by saying that the category of blended American whiskey doesn’t get much press but with Scotch blenders like Compass Box reviving the blend category to the level of art, I think we can expect similar American offerings in the future, including from the folks at High West."
