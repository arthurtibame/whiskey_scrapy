2.5,Just ok. I was interested because the price was right. 18 months may have something to do with it.

3.75,"I bought this with an open mind not expecting much based on the low ratings. However, it was on sale for $20 (per 375ml), I didn't have much to lose.

I've got to give it some credit- it's awesome for what it is. 100% malted rye and aged only 22 months, this single barrel rye carried an almost tropical aroma. My initial note on the nose was pineapple, but after letting rest for about 10 minutes the entire dram turned into a peach bomb. A big, fuzzy, peach bomb. I can't pick anything up other than that other than some slight baking spices. this is not a complex dram, but the peach flavor is rather pleasant. I do not regret my purchase at all, as this is much different than any whiskey I've tried before, and it's a very smooth sipper!"
