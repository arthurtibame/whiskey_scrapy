3.75,Not too bad at all. It is a good sipper with friends.  It has a short lifespan in your mouth. Had with @romanss as part of his first week. Welcome to the team
2.5,Caramel and light spice. Slight perfume at the end. Light yet flavorful. 7/19/19
3.75,"12 year Barton. Good whiskey, but not great. Pricey for a bottle as well. I’d go for a 1792 BiB if you could find that instead."
3.25,"Brethren tasting October 3, 2019"
3.75,Fruit forward; red apples and citrus. More complex version of weller special reserve. Little light on the mouthfeel but good finish. Recommend it if you find it.

3.75,Light sweet nose..spice and full flavor w clean finish
null,"Batch VA-2, batch size of 3 barrels. Aged for 12y4mo. Bottle 330 of 604. Pretty solid, loads of oak on the nose with hints of vanilla. Taste is lots of oak from the extended aging. Not sure it's worth $100/bottle, but I wouldn't turn it down if offered"
3.75,"Corn and burnt sugar nose. Very sweet and fruity up front, then woody oak and finally pepper in the end. This is made by Barton's, so essentially a 12 year old 1792 at 98 proof. Good but not remarkable enough to justify a $92 price tag, regardless of the 12 year label."
4.0,"The nose starts with cherry, leather, oak and vanilla. The palate is dry but mouth coating, with the cherry carrying over and mixing nicely with vanilla, along with oak, cinnamon and cream. The finish is medium long with a creamy oak that lingers along with fading cinnamon and vanilla."
