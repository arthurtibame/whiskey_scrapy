2.5,"This is a really surprising whiskey. It starts off fruity, but quickly develops some peat and smoke flavors that pervade the drink. It's still definitely sweet. This drink is amazingly rich and balanced at its reasonable price. It's on the sweet side for sure, but its balance of incredible. I recommend this whiskey above most others on the ground that it hits most targets with success. Beyond the peat, smoke, and sweetness, there is richness (which is in part due to the other categories) and a surprising amount of variety. Some fruity notes like banana come through, but they can't overwhelm the honest and true representative flavors here. This is proof that the regular order can be disrupted. At its price this whiskey is a tremendous bargain.
It's like a sweeter and fruitier Highland Park 18 with a bit less unification of character. So maybe an Oban?
The mineral notes are very strong here. They come with some fruity sweetness and are backed by peaty smoke. There isn't enough sweetness though and the flavors are not sufficiently balanced.
There is a lot going on here, but the flavors are less then brilliant. There isn't any gross alcohol flavor that causes problems, but the mineral and floral flavors combine with a celery-like vegetal flavor in a way that makes it taste a bit like Scotch mixed with gin and tequila. I don't love this wiskey, but it isn't bad; it just is confusing.
Floral, mineral, and fruit are strong in this. It's sweet, but does have some depth and richness to it. It's good if you drink gin or tequila first, but compared to almost any Scotch, it tastes young and ill-conceived despite its balance of Highland Scotch flavors.
There are some notable flaws here, but for $25 you could do so, so much worse. In the right context, there is actually a supreme amount of balance here, either with sweetness when compared with a rich Scotch or with smoke when compared with a mild gin. What's weird about this drink is that when it tastes good, all of the flavors taste good. When it tastes bad, there is just mineral flavor everywhere. There is some depth here and there are also some good flavors, but all that can be confirmed is that in some cases the net flavor of this drink is quite good. When the net flavor is good, this drink is quite good."

1.5,"Smells mostly like fruit and sherry. Super light and sweet. Tastes like it too. Flavors are okay, but if you blindfolded me and told me this was sherry I'd believe you. It doesn't taste cheap, which saves it, but I don't care for it at all."

4.25,"Great whisky. Tastes like a smoky highland single malt. Very fruity nose, smoky on the palate while the finish lingers for a rewarding length of time. Much more than I expected from the 40% alcohol."

4.0,Great intro whisky. I feel im less quick to push it by the waist-side than others because of price point alone.  For 35 dollars American its hard to find an American Bourbons or a Scotch with this type of quality.  I just wish it had a bit more character.

3.0,"and now for something completely different:  a blended French whisky from the Limousin region (which is mostly known for fine crafted Cognac).  Bastille 1789.  Like I said, it's blended and comes in at the minimum standard 80 proof.  Oddly enough, I found it while visiting family in the mountains of West Virginia.  I paid a very affordable $28 for a 750ml bottle.

The color is a deep, shiny-new copper and giving it a swirl produces very long, silky legs in the tasting glass.  On the nose there's a nice orange and apricot marmalade that will fade into a spicy, ginger burn if you inhale too quickly.

On the tongue, it opens again rather softly with a fruit marmalade that turns a little too quickly into a ginger/pepper burn from the oak casks.  The finish is insanely quick and short and all I really get is a blast of the advertised Limousin oak used to finish this whisky.  There's no info on how long it was aged overall or finished, but it's a warm and quick blast of oak that is gone too quickly IMO.

I'm not disappointed at all with the price point and a very respectable flavor profile for a blend.  If it only stuck around a bit longer after swallowing it I would put this in another category of blends close to Compass Box.  As it is, it's got an interesting flavor profile, but the quick finish somehow makes it rather forgettable- and that's a real shame.  It could be so much more.  Cheers, my friends."

3.0,"EDIT: I was initially not very impressed (and that review is below). At second glance, this is one of those whiskeys that just needs to breathe a little bit to really open up. The wet cat/bad tequila nose is gone now that the bottle's been open, and that's opened up space for fresh apple and pear, vanilla, and cinnamon to come through. On the palate, , it's a very pleasant peary, apples-and-cinnamon sort of dram with a touch of creamy vanilla. The more time I spend with this one, the more I enjoy it - it's not my usual style, and probably won't become a go-to for me, but it's very enjoyable and would be a good introductory whisky for someone who's maybe not quite ready for a big, bold single malt. I could also see this doing well in cocktails, especially in a hot toddy or combined with some apple cider.  I'd call this a solid 3.5 now.
        
        ***********************Original review*******I personally think that liberte, egalite, and fraternite could do a bit better for tribute than this, though it's not a bad whisky by any means. That said, it's certainly not a great one, either. The operative word here is suave...it's a very delicate nose with some apple and pear, and a little pinch of cinnamon and malt. There's also an unpleasant note to it, though, that immediately made me think of wet cat, cheap tequila, and bad college decisions...which, while a fun trip down Memory Lane, is perhaps not the most appetizing aroma from a $31 bottle of whisky. The palate is too watered down for me, but I did get some nice honey, apple, and spice notes...it's if like haroset were a whisky. There's a nip of white pepper at the very end on the palate, which is a pleasant surprise. I like it, I really do - I just don't love it."

3.75,"French whiskey — who knew? Kind of sweet, kind of fruity, kind of medicinal, kind of unique whiskey profile. It leans more toward Canadian whiskey with a touch of brandy. It’s a lighter cousin of Sexton, the Irish brandy. Definitely nice chilled and shared with a couple of friends. Not bad, not great. The fruit taste does remain. Maybe mix with a light ginger ale. Goes well with California rolls."

3.75,"I like this French blend of malted barley and wheat whiskies. It comes across much like a lightly smoked blended Scotch whisky---nothing like an American bourbon or rye, or a Canadian. (I don't mean to imply they are copying Scotch, just giving you a notion of what you are getting.) Using a variety of second fill casks from both wines and spirits gives hints of ripened fruits, honey, spice, a touch of smoke, and a definite cognac edge. The finish is medium and slightly astringent on the end. This is well worth trying if you can find it. It isn't overly expensive, but does not seem to be very widely distributed."
4.0,"Quite unique nose, it’s a woody sweetness that apparently is characteristic of French oak. The palate is slightly less interesting, it has more of a fruity sweetness with the French oak taking a back seat. The finish is really nice, and sweet but a bit short. Finish sweetness is reminiscent of vanilla cake"
3.25,"cinnamon, cloves, caramel, honey plus a hint of smoke and nectarines on the nose, the palate is viscous and syrupy with caramel, honey, nectarine and wood fire smoke notes, the finish has sweet and smokey notes, medium length."
