4.5,I love everything about this. It's not old enough to have that funk but my goodness this thing is near perfection. Maybe it nostalgia call it what you want but it checks off all the boxes sweet lil spicy oily coats the whole mouth. Finish is med long little citrusy and cinnamon. Its November in a glass
4.5,"I cannot wait for this thing to open up a bit. It's the perfect expression of WT. Its sweet and spicy and oaky with Cinnamon and the perfect amount of heat. it gives me the tongue tingles and has ""exceptional  mouthfeel"" (thats for you Chad) Fall is Turkey season and I bagged me a great one."
