3.0,Burn on the front. Mildly amusing. Don't love it and don't hate it. Have to try again to assess fully.

null,Smooth on the nose with a slightly smokey aroma. Strong tasting whisky that's sweet with a mild pepper note. Tastes much milder when ice is added.

5.0,"From Nikka’s ‘peaty’ distillery – this stunningly–balanced Yoichi is like Ardbeg in reverse: with bigger emphasis on fruitiness and sweetness rather than smoke. Yes, it will make love to your tongue."

3.0,"Color:
Light Brown chokolade abricut.
Nose:

Pow vanilla, baked apples and flower abricut.
Body:

medium-full; round and harmonic in shape.

Palate:

First contact with abricut, turning into baked apples slowly gliding toward the filling of being around a fire place.
Finish:
This whisky is hanging around in a very elegant way, even after a while the vanilla and fire place dance around each other, just staying there on your tongue letting you know of the fine whisky you just had.

(Sorry for miss spelling, English is not my first language)"

5.0,"Nose: Malted barley similar to beer, then fresh barley and fruits. Floral notes at the end. Fresh, vibrant and dark.

Taste: Oil makes a velvet entrance on your palate, then turns into coal smoke. Vanilla, nuts, fruits and toffee.

Finish: Creamy, with oak and fruits. Deep smoke in the aftertaste.

Balance: Deep, dark and velvety tones coming through in every step of the tasting. Great single malt whisky from Japan."

4.0,"First impression on the nose - FRUITY. Summer fruit like peaches or nectarines come to the forefront, with some honey and vanilla. Spicy notes on the palate, along with floral notes and honey, with the peach coming in at the very end and lingering on the tongue. Initially I didn't get any of the smoke, but after a few sips, it made itself known, though its still fairly light."

4.0,"Have you ever had a fruity IPA style beer while watching fireworks during the 4th of July?   You get this aroma of burnt wood alongside a whiff of berries.   This reminded me of that experience, in a good way.  The taste is just as good----lots of sweet roasted nuts like hazelnuts and macademias, plenty of peat, mixed in with a good dose of vanilla.  I noticed it's not as good with ice.  Definitely have this neat, or just a splash of water.  This is a really well made whiskey, simply highlighting again the fine craftmanship coming out of Japan.  It has no rough edges ( can be a positive or negative...depending on your mood that evening).  Simply well made, and well balance."

4.25,Had this at the Yoichi distillery April 2019 and it didn’t disappoint. Fruity + peat smoke. Too bad it’s been discontinued.

4.0,"My prhase ""there is not a bad japanese whisky"" almost found it's exception on this one. The nose is so unappealing (at least for me it is) that made me think it would also be bad on the palate, lucky for me, it wasn't. 

Bottled at 45%abv, pale gold. 

On the nose the alcohol note was very powerful. Peppery and spicy on the nose.Oily, Prunes Lemon and cheap chocolate notes. Awful on the nose at first. You need to let it sit for a while. 
Very spicy like chilli on the nose.

On the palate it improves a lot, Oak, Citrus note, Lemon candy, Peppery Pleasant and an Ashy note. Finish full of ginger and pepper, long.

The worst japanese whisky i have ever had, still is a decent dram: 83 over 100."
