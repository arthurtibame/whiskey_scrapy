null,"Last one on the shelf at Total Wine, unavailable in my home market. Just had to have one I guess."
2.0,"Despite it's presentation, lack of information on the bottle, and general scorn from the masses, this is not a bad Irish at all.  It literally tastes like sweet water, like a tamer Tullamore Dew (I know, right?).  Tastes like a Cooley whiskey (banana, malty grain) that's lacking any kind of barrel aging.  Great to offer to someone who typically doesn't drink whiskey or stronger spirits."
