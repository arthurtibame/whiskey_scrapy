5.0,"Massive nose, dominated by leather, play doh and a sweet menthol. Along with all the lovely sweet, caramel and vanilla aromas you'd expect from a (minimum) 10 year old whiskey. The palate is equally huge, filling your senses with oak, a touch of smoke, herbs and a big hit of warmth without fire. The finish goes on for ever. This stuff is dee-licious."
4.0,For a Rye I get a lot of sweetness. Would make a great Manhattan. Candy on the front slow burn going down. Just the right mix of heat and sweet.

4.0,"Barrel #16A116

Nose - Sweet vanilla, hint of marzipan, tiny bit of orange zest and ginger, light foamy hot milk chocolate.
Taste - Smooth lightly cherry vanilla, fairly dry, bit oaky, faint hint of sweet mint, light black pepper spice.
Finish - Lingering sweet cherry vanilla, lightly herbal, lightly bitter oak, pleasant tingling spice.
Score - 88/100
Final Thoughts - This is a tasty rye, the filtration and proof make it a very sippable rye with plenty of interesting notes of cherry, vanilla, and sweet mint. The flavors are there but are all pretty subtle so this is best enjoyed neat versus in a cocktail. Overall this is quite tasty, but if you factor in the price, I'd much rather get the Michter's Barrel Strength Rye and water it down myself."

4.0,"Great nose, some vanilla and oak.  You can definitely tell there is some extra age on this.  Very smooth vanilla and rye on palate.  Does not have a very long finish, which is one of the reasons I really prefer the barrel strength at the price point.  This is a 3.5 for me."

3.0,"Nose: Vegetal/herbal quality with a faint sweetness on the nose, loosely reminiscent of freshly brewed iced tea. Followed by spice and a hint of mint. Sitting with it for a minute brings out some butter cream sweetness lingering in the background. The nose is distinctively sweeter than MGP ryes.  
Palate: A nice balance of spice and sweet notes. The herbal quality comes through in the palate. There's a good amount of barrel, but nothing overwhelming. Surprisingly no licorice or anise. Surprised by how much corn comes through. 
Finish: medium dry 

Overall this is an interesting pour and a nice change of pace to a lot of the ryes on the market. However, I am somewhat surprised by bow underwhelmed I was by it."

3.0,"2016, Barrel no. 16A127. Great nose, fruity. Incredibly smooth on the palate. Some fruit notes, wood, char, pleasant rye spice. Ends with semi sweet chocolate. 10/18/17
2017, Barrel no. 17A25. Great nose. Rich, sweet, deep. Like sticky sweet caramel and fruit juice. A bit thin on the palate, but waves of flavor. Fruit, oak (shows its age but not in an overwhelming way), taffy. Lingering spice. Some cherry and bitterness at the end, along with some medicinal notes. Complex and flavorful, a good one to drink with other enthusiasts. 12/22/17"

4.25,"tried at hundred north. not a big rye fan but bartender recommended. very smooth. N vanilla, honey, oak."
4.25,"I should point out I'm not a huge rye guy but this one is definitely my favorite I've tried so far.  I was hesitant because I didn't think much of the Michter's 10 year bourbon despite liking some of their other items.

Nose: Some grassy herbaceous notes that I always expect from a rye, some sweet notes, barrel char and wood smoke, and toasted almonds.

Flavor: Spicy notes, leather, more toasted nuts, sweet caramelized sugar in the background, herbaceous flavors, and a nice oily texture that I really liked.

Finish: Spicy rye punch with deep dark flavors like dark chocolate, bitter wood notes like coffee but pleasant, a long spicy finish that I really enjoyed.

This was my favorite rye to date and if it wasn't so expensive and hard to find I think I'd go out and give it a buy."

4.25,"Nose- Heavy vanilla, cherry, orange zest, wood spice, lavender oil, dark fruits

Palate- Baking spices initially, chocolate covered oranges, caramelized sugar, mint, oak 

Finish- Long, thin finish with notes of baking spices, herbal mint, and vanilla 

This stuff is good. Perfectly balanced just like M10 bourbon. I could easily sip on this every day. Great notes of baking spices, herbal mint, and vanilla. The vanilla is apparent throughout the entire experience and one of the most pronounced vanilla smells i’ve ever had"

Not as thin as prior  years (but still thinner than I'd like), a bit sharp, it tapers off at the end then comes back stronger on the finish. Not as much food flavors, more industrial. 12/6/19"

Delicate on the tounge, but huge caramel notes come through for me. Definitely coats the tounge. It's delicious.

Got a short pour, so the end of one bottle, they are bringing a new pour from the next bottle! Will be interesting to compare."

5.0,A deep and complex pour. The rye spice is heavy but balanced with smooth oak and a rather lively palate. Not a drink all-day type pour but one for special occasions and rye enthusiasts. Not a lot of rye out there with this depth. Well done Michters.
