3.5,Knockando 21 is a whisky that apparently is special as the casks have been resting in a cooler part of a warehouse which means it takes longer to mature...hmm ok. Not sure why that makes it special given I'm pretty sure it's the 21 years which is the factor here around length of maturity but here goes. Ok nice viscosity.. check▪one dimensional flavour (honey/toffee)..check ▪Any advance on one nope. Slightly rough for a 21 year. I can see why this is cheap for it's age. In a word unmemorable. Wouldn't kick out of bed on a cold windy night though. Just under 3.5 I'll give it..definately got better as I got into it. Vague Glenlivet 18ish profile. Not the most amazing start to my 100+ step whiskey tasting programme but not a bad one either...at least I didn't buy a bottle
3.75,"Nose: Malt, caramel, pencil shavings, dunnage floor, dry hay, milk chocolate, coffee grounds, old furniture. Over time it gains a buttered toast aroma. Very laid-back and suave. [The dry-glass aroma is strong maple syrup with a little vanilla and milk chocolate]

Palate: Dark malt extract dissolved in strong, cold black tea. Marmalade, dark chocolate, black coffee, toasted almonds, tobacco, licorice and a little oak come forward in the development. There are some notes in the palate that remind me of porter or stout, but it's not particularly ale-like, and there is also a hint of walnut bread. The texture is creamy but dry. Water expands the background oak too much and spoils the balance.

Finish: Medium. Dry, but not hard or astringent. A warm dryness. Nutty and earthy with a final faint sweet note.

The nose on this is dry and it's entirely composed of dark, weighty malt aromas. There are no estery floral or fruit top-notes, no phenolic smoke whatsoever and no creosol maritime or mineral character. There is a sherry presence but it's subdued and not overly sweet.

The palate is earthy, malty and has a lot of strong flavours like tobacco and black coffee, but they are reserved and almost aloof at first. This is a very quiet whisky that takes a good while to open up and in several ways it reminds me of Glenfarclas. The main difference is that this has a dark chocolate and coffee personality whereas Glenfarclas has a fragrant heart of sandalwood and honeysuckle.

This whisky is like a painting executed entirely in earth-tones. I was uncertain at the start but it really grew on me as I tasted it.  In fact I was enjoying investigating it so much I almost forgot to leave enough to try with water. I did remember just in time, but to be honest I wish I hadn't. This is much nicer neat.

Tasted from a 30ml sample. Would I buy a bottle of this at the asking price of $165? No probably not, but I wouldn't turn down a pour of it and it has certainly made me interested in exploring more of their expressions. It has character.

""Good"" : 3.75 stars"

3.25,"Viscosity ok. Smells like toffee Apple. Tastes like spicy honey.
Nice enough and wouldn't turn it down but wouldn't pay that much for a bottle"
