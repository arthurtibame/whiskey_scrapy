4.0,"My second review of ""Ballantine's Single Malt series"" is this very nice dram, another not-so-famous Speyside distillery called ""Glentauchers"", in its 15yo expression. 

Bottled at 40%abv. 

On the nose, as speysider as a dram can be: Apples, Pear, Berries, Fresh fruit and Cinnamon.

On the palate, Pleasant, very easy drinkable. Oak spice. Chocolate and cocoa butter. Tobacco leaf.

Aftertaste is all about tobacco and chocolate. short finish.

Overall this is yet another very balanced, fruity, nice whisky. Very easy drinkable and within a reasonable price for a 15yo. 82 over 100."
