3.25,"Thought I'd have a crack at a swiss distillery which has been around for a bit now. Blurb for this is its a Swiss single malt whisky brand which was created in 2007, but the family behind it has a history in brewing and distilling that stretches back for over a century. In the year of 1857, Jakob Baumberger returned home as a newly graduated master brewer, and founded a distillery at his father's farm. Three years later, he took over the local brewery and continued his work. The distillery was based in an old grain store in the village of Langatun, situated about 30 miles north-east of the capital, Bern.
Shoot forward to the present day and his grandson, Hans Baumberger III, has continued the story, producing Langatun whisky as well as rum, vodka and liqueurs. Whisky production has been relocated to the Kornhaus in Aarwangen - demand grew slightly too large for the original distillery. All I can say to that is eh? Maybe I got a poor batch but this stuff is underwhelming. Waxy mild vanilla honey...I tipped most of it away."
