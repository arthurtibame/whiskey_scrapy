3.25,"Smells like cognac. If I didn’t know it was aged in cognac barrels then I’d nab it as a dark fruit nose, particularly apricots, plums. Very rich smooth flavor that drinks very nicely."

4.0,"Nose - Freshly cut apples, dark apple juice, light apple skin bitter, light caramel, faint raisin, chocolate

Taste - Light ""tingle"" with very little heat, chocolate, apple juice, caramel, light spice, light apple skin bitter, toffee, light raisin, cooked apples

Finish - Light fruity bitter, dried apples, chocolate, light raisin

Score - 82/100

Final Thoughts - So this one fit the ""standard"" Glenlivet profile of heavy on the apples but it did add a hint of chocolate & raisins that I attribute to the portion of cognac cask finished Scotch in this single malt blend. It's tasty on its own, but doesn't really make you go ""wow, this is incredible"" in any way. This is something best neat when you don't really want to think too much about what you're drinking.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - Only another if I could find it for about $40 USD"

3.75,"I can definitely taste the Glenlivet 12 year in this, but the cognac finish really elevates this whiskey.

Glenlivet 12 is something that I drink because it's pleasant enough while being quite affordable.  I don't really see it as any kind of elevated whiskey experience.  But the finish here really adds a layer flavors that raises Glenlivet to a higher level - the pleasant flavors of the 12 gain a strong vanilla and a rich fruitiness.  It's a different direction of the raisins and nuts that develop in a very sherry heavy Speyside, but it's a  nice change of pace.  When I finish this bottle, I probably won't rush out to replace it, but that said, I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again in the future."
3.25,"Of the few Glenlivets Ive tasted, this is the most interesting. Very oaky and earthy. Almost a dark cherry flavor going on underneath it all."
4.0,Surprisingly on point with a double wine family cask finish. On the nose and palate it is sweet. The finish is medium to long.

2.75,"The nose on this one, although pleasant, is surprisingly flat. There are notes of candied lemon, honey, honeysuckle, golden raisins, and a surprising herbal character somewhere in the neighborhood of mint and tarragon. The palate is  immediately sweet and floral as you’d expect from any Glenlivet. While initially it comes across very similarly to the Glenlivet 12, with heavily honeyed, floral notes, the cognac casks begin to make their presence known here with some interesting notes of cooked raisins, light baking spice, and a bit of buttery shortbread cookies. The finish however is where this whisky really shines. The immediate impression is of English toffee, roasted nuts, lemon drop candies, and a particular rancio note that I’ve come to associate with a well aged Armagnac. This dram doesn’t blow me away, but for around $40-$50 per bottle, it’s quite a respectable pour."
3.0,"Scotland has had long history of illicit distilling throughout 1700's and 1800's. When the 1823 Excise Act passed, George Smith was one of the first men to take out a license to distill. Smith had a reputation of traveling with a pair of pistols for protection from smugglers and gangs who were known to attack and destroy distilleries.
Glenlivet was acquired from Seagram's in 2001 by Pernod Ricard. There has been a big push by the parent company to make Glenlivet the world's best-selling single malt Scotch. It has achieved that status in the United States but is in second place to Glenfiddich on the global scale.
The single malt coming from the distillery is known for floral and pineapple flavor notes.
This particular expression was launched exclusively in the U.S. in July of 2019. Consequently, the U.S. accounts for approximately 40% of all Glenlivet sales.
On the nose: orange blossoms, golden raisins, vanilla, lemon drop. On the palate: honey sweetness, black pepper spice, milk chocolate, and pineapple. Sweet on the finish at first, then herbal bitterness and pineapple astringency before it's quickly over.
This is a smooth and easy drinking expression that is perfect for anyone that is new to whisky. Lots of pleasant flavors, not overly complex, and very little bite at 40% ABV. For those who want a bit more complexity, this is still a good whisky to finish the night with after a few excellent pours."
3.75,Very good. Speyside profile - sweet and honey. Borders on too sweet but stays in bounds.
2.75,"50ml poured neat in a Glencairn at home.  Nose has candied orange peel, fruitcake, vinous notes.  Sweet.  Nice.  The cognac cask has done its work.  Taste is a touch astringent and bittersweet, the orange peel has lost its candy, replaced by darker fruit like dates, raisins.  Leaves a bitter and frankly unpleasant lingering heat on the back roof of the mouth.  If the taste was more in line with the nose, I would like this so much more.  As it is, not a fan.   10/18/19"

5.0,"Color dark gold (artificial coloring?), viscous, and clear (chill-filtered?). Nose is somewhat weak, sour, malty, with cereal, black pepper, and toffee notes. Palate is quite different, dominated by sweet character, with raisins, toffee, vanilla, pear, citrus, and oak notes. Finish is quite long, pleasant, with chocolate and more fruit character. A few drops of water don’t do much for this 40% ABV whisky. Character is weakened, but suddenly a hint of nuts appears on the finish. Overall, this is a nice and quite complex dram that is very much enjoyable. For $46 at Costco this is a definite keeper."

The taste is of a full-bodied spice, definitely cinnamon in there. There's cherry, raisin, orange and dark chocolate. 

There is a lingering bite at the back of the throat, but it's warming. I found it overall improved with a little water."

3.0,"Nose: heavy honey, apple, pear, peaches, faint malt and grape jam notes. Very light hint of pepper.

Taste: malt, apple, pear. Slight vanilla cream note that immediately collapses into condensed grape jam. Heavy sweet honey finish with a bit of oak spice. 

It is better than Glenlivet 12 from my memory. A lot more dense flavor. But tbh it’s probably not worth the price at $50. 40 is probably a better price point. Loses some points because it’s supposed to be a step up from the standard, maybe for more developed palettes and it fails in that job"

4.0,"Very lovely. Takes a lot of its character from its Cognac cask. The color is a beautiful amber, reflected like a mirror when held up to the sun. The nose is a nice, sickly sweet scent. Hints of of the charred oak and almost a cherry tree sap smell, definitely inspired by the Cognac. Palette delivers much of what would be expected by the nose, after which is settled by a rich, smoky flavour that gently lets the finish go down nice and smoothly."

3.0,"Never had cognac finish so lets see. Poured neat, nose is pretty similar to the 12 but with more depth and weight. It does take longer to open up coming across more reserved. Palate is sweet fruity malt with a tinge of spice, oak and light peat. The flavor is deeper and fuller than the 12 and more refined. Finish is where the cognac shows up with some dry grape notes to accompany the standard malty barrel fade. There is some baking spice as well to round it out. This is a nice easy scotch that many will enjoy myself included. Not a bad value at $50ish for a 14yr either. That being said Im not blown away by this and doubt Id pick up full bottle(got a 50ml) Overall a solid dram without complexity or peat smoke......81/100"
3.75,"Very similar to the glenlivet 12. Not sure it warrants the price increase?

3.0,Nose makes me think it's hotter than 40%. A little bit of cinnamon and branded cherries on nose. I get an immediate hit of apple juice that brings in some butterscotch as it lingers. Feels a little looser in the middle and then does finish quite hot. Definitely cooked apples and vanilla on finish. Tasted from a sampler in a Glenlivet 12.

Very smooth whiskey with toffee, coffee, and chocolate notes and a light nuttiness. Ends with fruit notes and light smoke. Extremely smooth all the way through, smoother than Maker's 46."

2.75,"New Glenlivet as of summer 2019. Interesting concept; I've never tried a cognac-aged whisky let alone a cognac-aged Scotch. Let's see if this was a worthwhile attempt by Glenlivet to diversify their portfolio.

Nose: At first its a lot of the standard Glenlivet notes: apple, pear, apricot, peach, honey, vanilla, caramel, and toffee. But behind that I get some darker notes, akin to what I get in sherry cask finished-malts. Plum, raisin, and cola comprise the second layer of flavor. Beyond that it's grainy cereal, oatmeal, shortbread cookie, and marshmallow. A bit of nail polish. With time, I get some pineapple. Maybe just a hint of tobacco and black tea. It's a bit muted at first but surprisingly becomes very good given some time to open up.

Palate: Malty toffee and orchard fruit. More apple, pear, apricot, honey, vanilla, and a bit of raisin. A bit of milk chocolate and walnut. Some orange and banana. Slight maple syrup. Cereals and grains. It's decent, but unspectacular following that stellar nose. The cognac influence seems to be all but gone save that one subtle raisin note.

Finish: Apple and pear persist for all of two seconds, and then it's a puff of cinnamon and oak before it's all gone. Short, uneventful finish.

Nosed it first, and thought it was great. Nuanced, complex, and unique. If I was just nosing this, I'd say it's up there with the best of them. I didn't expect much from this when I heard it had been released, and my initial impression as I nosed it was that this was an improbable home run.

But I paid $60 for this. And the palate was as regular as they come. Not bad, but in no way memorable. I think it'd best be described as even-keeled. And then the finish.... I enjoy a little intensity in a finish. If Mott's Apple Juice is a 10/100 on the intensity scale, this is a 12/100. If they were going for ""smooth""--nailed it. If they wanted this to be remotely interesting, not even close. A great nose is awesome, but I'm here to drink the whisky. And this one drinks like a tentative tea ball player.

I'm sure I'm being a bit harsh. But after such a promising start, I just feel utterly let down. I've always been a big fan of Glenlivet, the 12 year was the first single malt I ever purchased, and I loved it back then. I understand what they're going for here, but I just can't appreciate it. Seems to me like they just needed a 14-year counterpart to match their Speyside rival--Glenfiddich. This scent would make for an amazing car freshener or bedroom candle. But as a whisky, I'd say pass, people."
3.75,Lots of flavor from the cognac. Longer/more aromatic finish than the 12 but similar on overall profile. Splash of water brings out another layer of faint chocolate and spice.

This is much more enjoyable than the 12 year. One of the better Speysides I’ve tasted."

3.75,"On paper this sounded like a wonderful dram.  It is good, but, only good to my taste, not GREAT.  The problem for me is that for me, Glenlivet is an only so-so single malt,  easy drinking and non-pretentious.  A dram I would not insult or refuse if offered by a friend, but, a dram I would not seek out.  Finishing this dram in a cognac cask gives another, slightly fruity dimension to the dram, but only elevates it a little.  (I think the cognac finish would add much more to a more hefty dram.)  Where I live this sells for about $25-30 more than the standard Glenlivet 12.  It simply is not worth that.  If you can get it for $10 more, give it a try and see what you think."
