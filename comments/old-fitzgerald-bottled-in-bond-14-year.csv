4.5,"The nose has pleasant oak up front that is met with cinnamon, with smooth vanilla and caramel and a slight fruitiness in the background. The oak and cinnamon mix very pleasantly on the palate with it leaning more towards cinnamon, as the vanilla and caramel keep it balanced. Oak lingers in the mouth while the cinnamon fades and keeps the mouth tingling for a nice long finish."

4.25,Sweet maple syrup nose. Sweetness continues all the way through on the palate along with a cherry fruitiness and cinnamon. Very little burn. Reminds me of Old Forester Birthday Bourbon. No need to ice or water this one down. A solid bourbon.
