3.0,Heavy wood and caramel on the nose. The palate is lively almost carbonated feeling. Taste follows the nose with wood caramel and maybe a touch of smoke. The finish is woody and slightly dry.
4.0,"Smokey, woody nose.  Confirmed on the taste.  Sweet yet light and pretty smooth.  I tried it at the distillery and really enjoyed it."

4.0,"Bittersweet tobacco on the palate, yet it finishes a bit hot and sweet. I don't know why it's not 5 stars, but during a whisky tasting I kept going back to Wiser's Legacy and Johnnie Walker Select Rye Casks."
