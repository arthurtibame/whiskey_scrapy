4.0,Fantastic flavor! The grape spirit contrasts wonderfully with the spice of the rye.
4.25,Vanilla and earthy nose with cinnamon on the taste.
3.5,"(Batch No: 7)

This rye whiskey from Paso Robles really surprised me.  I’m not generally a big fan of rye, but this is a very tasty dram.

I was in California in September 2018 for a work trip combined with a bit of a holiday and we visited the distillery for a bit of down time.  This bottle has been sitting unopened in my cabinet since then.  On lockdown thanks to Coronavirus, my wife and I decided to crack it open.

Up front, this is a smooth whiskey.  It has a good alcohol hit, probably due to the spirit only ageing for 12-36 months, but it doesn’t taste harsh for it.  It’s oily enough to give a lovely thick mouth feel.  The whisky is sweet, spicy and fruity, there’s a chilli hit and a good amount of vanilla and a lovely cognac/ Armagnac finish.

Overall, probably one of my favourite rye whiskies.  Nice!"
