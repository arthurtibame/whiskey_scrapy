3.25,Not nearly as complex but smooth and cheap - good for cocktails

4.5,"Reason for the high rating again is the price. This usually sells between 12-15 dollars and you can't beat the price for a 100 proof. Nothing incredibly special about it, it's pretty much Evan Williams black label but stronger"

3.0,"Another good BIB. Evan Williams BIB is a really great value comparable to OGD BIB in quality, but perhaps 1/3 cheaper. It's really lovely vanilla bean and nutmeg on the nose. About the same going in but a tad more heat than OGD BIB. Enjoyed neat. Get you a bottle. It's too cheap not to try."
3.75,"This is one of those bottles that will always have a place on my shelf. Great in cocktails, delicious on the rocks, and a fine sipper neat. Nothing overly complex, but straightforward and tasty, and very difficult to beat at its price."

3.25,"Each sip is a little different. Heavy spice, but sweet, lots of flavor. Great for the price and old fashions"

2.75,Good mixing bourbon
3.5,"Smells citrus & tastes similar. Citrus & butter notes. It tasted smooth with a slight tang or pepper at the end.

This bottle-in-bond, in my opinion, is the best value bourbon. $12 for a 100 proof bourbon aged 4 years is hard to beat."

4.0,"Neat. Neck pour.  First time having this beloved bottle.  $18 in Ohio.  Nose is very nutty.  Some chocolate and toffee.  Nice vanilla.  For only 100 proof, you can get caught by the alcohol if you dive too deep.

Texture is light but not thin.  Dark chocolate sweetness on the tongue, transitions into that nuttiness and straight into the vanilla.  Finish is a bit drying with a hint of oak and that charcoal finish.

This is a great bottle.  Not just because it’s $18 but because it is $18 bucks with no real negative qualities.  That finish holds it back a tad if I am being picky.  Otherwise it’s a nice Nutter Butter sandwich with vanilla wafers in the middle."

2.5,Perfect mixer for the price. Finishes very fast. Not complex enough and and too much ethanol for drinking neat.

3.0,"Gets the job done. Good for the price. Smells quite strong but the taste doesn't have as much of a kick to it as you would think. Caramel, vanilla, and a sweet peanut finish. Bang for your buck and I can see this being a great cocktail mixer."
3.75,"Nose has big leather and oak. First sip has front and back of mouth burn. Vanilla, leather, cherry...big flavors with a solid burn. Definitely more flavor than you’d expect for a 100 proof at this price. Big burn but a flavor profile to match. A few drops of water increases the rye on the nose but the burn dips a bit to be more manageable. Not the best sipper straight, but for the price, accessibility, and proofing, it’s a good drink."
2.75,"Pretty simple nose. Sweetness dominates. Almost smells like I’m in the beginning steps of making sugar cookies.

Easy on the palate for 100 proof. Slight spiciness but vanilla and caramel sweetness is what is on display here.

Short, dry finish leaving more to be desired. Gets me going back, I guess.

Decent sipper for the price as it was under $20 after tax. If I need to grab something cheap for a party or just want to hammer through something and not care too much about what I’m drinking, this is probably what I’d pick up."

3.0,The best bottle I’ve had under $20 hands down. It’s a steal for the price.

3.75,For $18 this is a winner
3.0,Not very vanilla-y. Reasonably smooth for the price. It is a value for what it is.
