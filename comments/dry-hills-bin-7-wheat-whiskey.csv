2.5,"At the distillery and got served a glass of this after a cocktail.  It came cloudy and unfiltered - nice!

Nose: Reminds me of a young, green malt even though it's 80% wheat. A bit of surprising rye kick too. Dark wildflower honey and caramel syrup. Vanilla toffee.  Goddamn, it's straight butterscotch syrup now.

Palate:. Very sweet with some nice spiciness at the end.  A little smokey like burnt toffee, which I like. Sawdust and grain bin.  A little bit of greenness, like grass and some sort of herby note.

Finish: Medium length and mild.  Sweetness disappears first, leaving black pepper and sawdust. I'd say old corn, but there's no corn in the mashbill!

Conclusion: For a young local, this is pretty impressive. Definitely young, and a bit sweet for me, but overall I like it."
3.25,"Odor: Sweet, but not sickeningly. Smells rougher than it is. Strong alcohol odor. 

Taste: Dusty, oily emulsion. Starts off sweet and smooth with vanilla and toffee, turning into a burn in the back of the mouth. Not peppery. 

Finish: Dustiness lingers, heavy barley flavor fades into rye. Puckers the back of the tongue, but buttery on the front."
