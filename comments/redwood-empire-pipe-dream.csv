3.75,"The nose made me expect a sweeter taste. The taste itself ended up presenting itself as almost smokey to me (which I’d otherwise like if I was drinking scotch or mezcal). Was willing to pay for the price I got it to try, but wouldn’t buy again at the normal price"

4.25,"Definitely a sweeter bourbon. Lots of corn, but a satisfying easy sipper. Drank with two ice cubes. Never heard of the distiller but the guy at the liquor store suggested it. A bit of bite at the very end."

4.5,"Nose on this one is hard to find because it's almost not there but when you find it is lovely honey, vanilla, corn syrup provides the sweetness, nice fruitiness not quite pappy peach and apricot but a light fruit note almost at times like faint strawberry/ cherry and pear note. Just can't pin the exact fruit down. Palate is very easy drinking sweetness is the word that leaps from the glass, along with the honey, light oak, vanilla, and nuttiness. Almost a pecan praline but not that much vanilla and sugar. The rye and some cinnamon spice notes are very much there but aren't overpowering and fade quickly. You can make them stronger by agitating the whiskey in your mouth but they still aren't bad. Finish is short because nothing about this whiskey is out of balance or overpowering. This should appeal to everyone except those who don't care for dessert/sweet whiskeys. The oak does ramp up a bit on the finish with some barrel char but the light rye spice, sweetness and vanilla are there also."

4.25,"Neat. Neck Pour.  Pie crust and coffee come through on a very dark nose for a 90 proof bourbon.  Decent amount of oak for a young bourbon.  Burnt caramel.  Hint of bubble gum and ripe red fruits (bouncing around cherries or raspberries.). Getting a hint of nuttiness the longer I sit with it.  

Nice oily texture again.  Lost Monarch I thought the same thing.  It has a great mouth feel for 90 proof.  I am a fan of this one!  Cherry sweetness at first turns into caramel, vanilla.  Cherry and vanilla just keep swirling together to through the legs.  Slight hint of bubble gum lingers subtly.  The oak and nuttiness never come through on the taste.

Solid 4 year!  This is a clean, smooth, inviting experience.  Not complex, but the limited range is delicious.  Fantastic pour for $30!  I want to equate this to a Weller Special Reserve in a lot of ways off memory."

3.75,"Neat in a rocks glass at Uncle Mark's in South Plainfield following Grandpa's internment service.  Nice oak and spice, with a slight bite on the finish.  Very drinkable.  11/20/19"

3.5,"Very sweet on the nose, making you expect vanilla and butterscotch. First taste is surprisingly smooth and slightly smokey, with some sweetness coming through. Really opens up with heat at the end. Long finish."
