5.0,"Tried this at whiskey washback. Very good stuff from the land down under. Has notes of chocolate, berries, and spices."
2.0,"Smells like an American malt on the nose but quickly changes. Oaky, and tastes pretty juvenile. Pineapples and apples, a bit of that malty funk, sugary fruits."

2.5,"Bland and uninteresting. Starts flat and kinda sour, then there’s a tiny bit of heat and then it flattens out again. It’s just kind of boring."
1.5,"Flavor is a little dull, mild amount of heat but no complexity. Smells like... alcohol."
2.5,Tastes okay but nothing interesting/distinguishing.
2.75,"Smells like alcohol. Sightly woody, no strong flavors, not complex. Not much aftertaste."

3.0,Too smooth for ones own good. Very little bite. A bit of smoke. A mile sweet taste.
4.5,Very smooth. A little bitter on the tale. Complex. Drinkable.
4.0,"Fruity, floral, mild spice"
3.25,Intense spice build up. Vanilla and a bit of honey as taste buds grab hold. Little oak in profile. Oily texture. No smoke or peat. Strong in mouth and lingering spice and heat on back end.
3.75,Really smooth with a sweet finish

3.25,"Oak wood, quick, earthy nose, sweet"
3.5,Strong fruit and sweetness on the nose. Taste is drier than you would expect with a slight wine flavor and more dominant toasted grain. A great whiskey and interesting departure from bourbon and scotch flavor profiles.
3.5,A little young/hot tasting

3.0,Very winey.  Like don’t love.  Smells crazy and definitely smell the grapes.  Easy to drink
3.5,"Incredibly fruity, almost too much. Very bright but could see it being divisive."
3.5,"Extremely wine-forward nose that is immediately apparent as soon as you pop the cork on this bottle. The smell evokes a sort of happy, light feeling - which I imagine I'd feel if I were vacationing in Australia. Smelling a little more, there's definitely a malty undertone that belies its origins.

Palate is surprisingly viscous for this 41%. The sherry-like sweetness of the nose carries through initially, but eventually transitions into a malty funk.

Finish is extremely dry. As the funk fades, the fruits come back and plays along with an okay tannin.

Very unique - worth experiencing. In reviewing the bottle, this was aged only a short 2 years, which is really astounding considering the complexity. Defining characteristic of this was the way it changed from nose to mouth to finish."
3.5,Sweet

4.0,"My first try of not just an Australian Whisky but one distilled in Melbourne. Can definitely tell this one's finished in a red wine cask from nose and finish. Reminds me of Yamazaki with red berries on the nose. Floral and white chocolate palate, with a slight spiced and red wine finish. Interesting."
3.5,definate notes of redwine. nice. further tasting required

3.5,"Nose: Fruit. Red apples, fig, plumb, cherry, caramel, vanilla, and a toasty brown sugar leads up the rear. 

Taste: A fraction of the nose is there, subtle fruit, apples and other murmurs get swallowed up by wood, you will suck in your cheeks if you drink enough. Dark chocolate might be found on the aftertaste.

Note:  I do not think most reviews have been fair, the nose is great, I could sniff away all day, the taste isn't bad just lacking in comparison. 
Like a beautiful date that can't kiss. It's nice to admire but your lips will be disappointed. 

I think a lot of people get excited by the aroma only to have that excitement dashed by the taste, leaving them bitter. I can enjoy the nose on its own but if the taste could match this world be a whiskey to behold."

3.75,"This is a really cool and different type of single malt whisky. The wine barrel is not overbearing and it has just enough sweetness on the palate. My favorite thing about this pour is the heavy oakyness, but not too oaky."
