4.25,Nice and smooth
4.0,"Outstanding for as young as it is. Can’t wait for the 4 year (and beyond).  Great place to visit in historic Jonesborough, TN.  As far as I can tell this is not a sourced product, but is actually distilled in East Tennessee (or am I mistaken?)"
4.0,3 year. Smooth and flavorful. Sips above its age.
3.75,Smell is mild. Woody with slight richness on the nose. Dry and earthy upfront with some nut and coffee on the end. Really not a bad bourbon. Doesnt stand out but hey its a 2 year old that isnt expensive
4.0,"Sweet and tasty, rich, a really good young bourbon.  Bought it at the distillery from the distiller himself, enjoy it every time I put a glass."
4.5,"Nice and mild. Deep enough flavors to keep me coming back for more. I was worried that it was too young, but it matured nicely. As I get deeper into the bottle, it gets better and better."
