4.0,"Let me start by telling you... this is not whisky. This is a spirit liquor. Why do i rate it, you might ask, and the answer is simple. It is Freaking great. 

I have seen this bottle like a hundred times in many whisky online stores but i have never had it in my hands. Finally, the first day i arrived at Scotland, the first dram i took was from this. 

It is a lemonade. Smells like lemonade, tastes like lemonade, gets you drunk like whisky with lemonade. Maybe some saltiness to it.

I think it must be scored at least a 85/100 because it is so great, specially compared to fireball, jim beam apple, jack daniel's fire and other garbage out there. Amazing liquor, if it ever arrives to Ecuador, society will be lost on how good it is. Sláinte."
2.25,"Sweet, fresh"
