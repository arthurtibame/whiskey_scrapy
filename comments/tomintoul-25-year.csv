5.0,"This one was great. It had definite salt in the nose as well as berries in the nose on tasting, there was more salt pepper and caramel flavor is along with some of the fruit and had a nice aftertaste was more of the caramel and fruit that we liked very much."

4.0,"The nose has a strong bourbon note with cinnamon and sweet toffee.  That apple character persists, but it’s more baked apple pie here.
-
Very dense on the palate, but also more gentle than the others.  Sweet toffee with oak, butter, vanilla and cinnamon.
-
The finish is soft and creamy with the barest hint of spice."

3.0,"This was the third sample in the official Tomintoul Distillery 3cl sampler pack I bought online a couple of months ago.  This well aged pour is the main reason I purchased the set because getting a 25 year old sample of this in a bar would’ve surely cost just as much ($34), if not more.  I had a feeling the 10 & 16 year samples might not add up to much (see my reviews for them here as well), but a 25 is almost always tasty.

This one was shimmering gold in the tasting glass and just a touch darker than the other two, younger samples.  It still felt like it should’ve been darker after spending a quarter of a century in the cask, but oh well.  It had many oily legs while not leaving any water droplets behind- I know this isn’t cask strength, but I’m sure the angel’s share probably kept them from adding too much water- even to get it down to the 40%abv bottling strength.

The nose was vanilla and bread-y with plenty of oak notes and some surprising hints of alcohol.  After a good 20-25 minutes I also got a little bit of peaches in the background.  The palate was nice and smooth, as it should be, with peaches again along with some pears and slight orchard fruitiness.  There was no oak note at all on the tongue.  The finish was medium length and silky smooth, but it lacked any real depth or lingering character- just a slight peppery bite.

Overall, it’s marginally better than the 10 & 16 year samples that were included here, but I think Tomintoul takes their slogan a little too much to heart.  “The gentle dram” sounds inauspicious enough, but I little kick back or character would go a long way here.  It’s just too soft.  I gave both the younger pours a 3 star rating and I feel like this deserves a bump because it does have a little more going for it in the flavor profile and is well-rounded like a 25 year should be.  3.5 stars, but at $400 for a full bottle- I won’t be buying much else from Tomintoul unless they push their own envelope a bit further.  Cheers, my friends."

2.25,"Nose: huge bowl of fresh cut autumn apples, lemon, sour grapes, bid of honey, very fresh and not at all mature or settled as you would expect from a 25y. 

Palate: hard arrival with a fresh fruity sourness and light chili burn. Herbal tea aromas along with a woody bitterness reminding me of mate-tea. 

It sadly is not very pleasant. I mean, it definitely is interesting and has some impressive fullness with a long aftertaste, but I would never have guessed 25y age. It feels and tastes like one of the many popular NAS whiskies from oh so many distilleries these days with 3 to 7 years in one or two large casks. Those aren’t bad at all but this Tomintoul here is missing a twist or convincing character - it doesn’t deliver that and so for me it is just a fairly normal dram with nothing special or something to remember it for. Strange but glad I had it. Worth a try - for me not worth a whole bottle."

4.25,"I'm surprised at this one. The sample I have is not a gentle dram at all. Now it's no (typical) Mortlach in profile but its rich, robust and flavorful. Toffee, Caramel, cinnamon, dark fruits and more. Very nice dram. The finish is shortish and initially very slightly harsh which detracts from the experience but it makes you want to take another hit to get the full experience one again. In time that to fades and it becomes a more balanced. Definitely changed my opinion of Tomintoul 180 degrees."

3.25,"N - 84: Mild fruits and spices.

T - 85: Very weak flavours, no complexity. Seems like a watered down Glenlivet 18.

F - 87: Nice finish but not flavours.
