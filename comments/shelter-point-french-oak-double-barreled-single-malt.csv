4.0,"Lots of flavours in this dram, enjoy with a charcuterie board or selection of chocolates and you will discover different scents and tastes. Love how there isn’t one dominating taste you can’t get past."
3.5,"Received a sample and I really liked it.  Sweet, spice, apricot.  Nice balance and good abv selection, no water required.  Recommended, I expect more age would move this to a 4 star."
