4.0,"Nose - oh it's a dank warehouse, dark fruits...over ripe.  This is old and yet the sherry dominates this, there's none of that oak bitterness coming through. Rich and fruity.

Taste - rich, chocolate, butter, sherry, spicy oak. The finish is long, lingering, rich, complex. 

It isn't the most nuanced and detailed whisky to discuss. It's a sherry bomb and you can really tell this is using those european oak casks which gives it all kinds of spice flavors."

5.0,"Nose - Syrupy raisins/prunes/dates, light sweet almonds, dark toffee, mulled red wine, hints of chocolate covered cherries.

Taste - Sweet ginger/white pepper spice, syrupy dark but refreshing dark dried stone fruits, dark toffee, lightly tannic, fresh bing cherries.

Finish - Long lasting dark fruity sweet, dark toffee, ginger spice, chocolate sweet, fresh bing cherries.

Score - 95/100

Final Thoughts - This is quite spectacular and what I imagine a well done sherried dram should be. Very nicely balanced, no off-putting notes. Nice fruity spice but shows its age very well. Amazing sherry influence but not overly sweet (this wouldn't be an everyday dram for sure) but is more on the desserty side of things.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes

Would I buy a bottle? - Yes"

5.0,Glengoyne has mastered the sherry bomb and it’s a perfect compliment for the Glengoyne style. Glengoyne’s finest expression is this 25 year and it is breathtaking!
