4.0,"PRICE: $60-80.  Widely available.
INFO: Single malt scotch whisky distilled by Glenmorangie from the North Coastal Highlands region.  This is your basic 10 year old ex-bourbon Glenmorangie finished for 2 additional years in ex-sauternes casks.  Sauternes is a sweet white wine from France.  This is bottled at 46% ABV.  “D’or” is pronounced “door”, except you have to make the first sound of hacking of spitwad at the end.  C’est francais.

NOSE: 85/100.  I definitely get white wine.  White grapes plays well with the fresh green fruits and florals of the Glenmorangie base.  The original 10 year old already noses so pleasant; this is different, but is not necessarily better.
PALATE: 86/100.  This is much sweeter than the nose.  Vanilla, honey, sultanas.  A tiny bit of water improves this.  It becomes softer, and you can find some peaches and apricots.
FINISH: 84/100.  The best finish out of all the core range 12 year old finished Glenmorangies.  There’s a captivating transition point into a creamy citrus.  There’s still that white wine, but there’s also lime sherbet, lemon rinds, and a moderate amount of pepperiness from cloves and ginger.  The linger is medium.

OVERALL: Solid whisky, to be sure.  But I don’t agree with packaging.  Why does the box have hinges and why is this $10-20 more than La Santa and Quinta Ruban?  It’s not like Sauternes finishing is rare or unique.  For example, Arran does it without fanfare.  In the end, I like this better than La Santa, but I prefer Quinta Ruban, which is cheaper.

MARK: 85/100.
VALUE FOR MONEY: Unwarranted premiumization.  This used to be in plain box, like the other core Glenmorangies.  I think this is worth about $50; but for that money, I would rather get the port-finished Quinta Ruban."

4.0,"You can damn near smell fresh fruit like peach and mango just on the nose alone. Not shocking when it’s aged in a sweet dessert wine cask like Sauternes really. Loads of honey, apricot and marmalade on the palette, orange, pineapple, even faint hints of ginger make appearances to try and add a little savory to this overly sweet dram. An excellent way to finish a night in a good restaurant, but I can’t see myself spending money on a bottle when I could just get a bottle of the Quinta Ruban, or the Original and bottle of actual Sauternes. Feels a tad gimmicky methinks."

While I would still say I have rookie palate, it definitely is no problem to find notes. Strong ginger and cinnamon with fruits on longer feel. Apricot, pear(maybe I’m mistaken it for something else?), but lovely drink. Wouldn’t say I would call it as sweet as it’s rated normally, but perhaps that’s the first try."

3.0,"#Whiskyreview of Glenmorangie Nectar D’Or (French for “golden nectar”). Aged for 12 years (basically the original Glenmorangie 10 + final 2 years in Sauternes wine casks) and bottled at 46%. It’s also #nonchillfiltered. Reviewed during happy hour at @ruthschris on 8/22/2018.
....…......….…...........................................................................
Nose: 89. Vanilla, peach, apricot, citrus, and maple syrup.
....…......….…...........................................................................
Palate: 86. Rum, vanilla cream, and spicy oak. It tastes a bit young for a scotch that’s been aged for 12 years.
....…......….…...........................................................................
Finish: 84. Medium finish with dry oak and citrus, but much of the flavors dissipate and there’s a slight alcohol burn at the end.
....…......….…...........................................................................
Overall: 86. Kudos to @glenmorangie for applying a unique cask to finish this formula and bottling at 46% with non-chill filtering. I’ve never tried Sauternes wine, but from what I’ve read, it’s a sweet dessert wine with many of the flavor profiles that I picked up in this whisky. This dram has a pleasant nose, but the palate and finish left me wanting more.
....…......….…...........................................................................
Value for Money: A bottle of #GlenmorangieNectarDor sells for about $65 to 75 USD and I think there are better buys out there in that price range. That being said, it’s worth a try for a simple fact that it’s different and unique compared to your typical #singlemaltscotch."

Este whisky é finalizado por dois anos em barrís que antes continham o vinho branco de sobremesa Sauternes (originário da França), que agrega à esta bebida características adocicadas únicas, agradando muitas pessoas mas desagradando várias outras, aquelas que não gostam de whiskies mais doces. Whisky encontrado no Brasil e com o custo mais alto da linha 12 anos, no entanto não é uma exorbitância. Recomendo para degustação em forma pura."

Some air in the bottle does improve the taste. Less silky smooth, but the flavor is now much more outspoken with a generous amount of spice and wood, the sweetness level is lowered  as well. So much flavor, delicious! The previous score of 3.75 has gone up to 4.5. My favorite of the Glenmorangie offerings I tried and it is probably the best whiskey I tried so far.

The smoothest of the bunch (Quinta Ruban, 10 and Lasanta) but also the sweetest, a sugary sweetness similar to the 10. The nose is similar to the 10 as well, a white wine tanginess, but the flavour itself lacks a good amount of tartness, bitterness and spice. It is there, some ginger, some oak, but somewhat muted in favour of a smooth delivery. Still delicious, but I think I like the Lasanta and the Quinta Ruban better. Even if the Nectar is fuller, rounder, 'mouth coaty' / oily."

3.5,"I bought the Glenmorangie Taster Pack for $34.95, which includes 4 x 100 mL of Glenmorangie Original 10Y and the three primary finished versions. That breaks down to $8.74 for each, which is overpriced for the original but good value to try the Nectar D'Or. (In NC the 750 mL is $69.95.) Let me clearly state that I'm very glad this sampler was available because the Nectar is by far the least impressive of the 3 finished versions, the least different from the original, and is the most expensive. I chalk this up to the whiskey only being finished for <2 years in dessert white wine casks, while the other two are finished in heavy red wine casks. Other than having a slightly drier taste with more pronounced nose, I don't think the Nectar is remarkably different from the Original. At $70 this is not only $25 more than the Original, but it is $15 and $12 more than the much better Lasanta and Quinta Ruban. Don't misread this as I hate this whiskey, because it tastes nice. But based on value I don't recommend this at all because I think you're wasting your money when you can buy the cheaper finished versions or the original."

I think the overall flavor of the Glenmoragies seem to be my favorite, I think I just need to try the 18 year to get a smoother more complex taste and finish."
1.5,"This is the 4th Glenmorangie whiskey I've tasted. The other three were great, and I was hoping they would go 4 for 4. Unfortunately this one didn't hit the same mark, but it isn't bad, just disappointing. The smell is heavy and dominated by blueberries, acai and is undercut by a very subtle earthy note. The taste is strongly and almost overwhelmingly cinnamon. Very one note taste. finish is a bit rubbery. Meh. The port was better."

4.0,"I didn’t know when I picked up a bottle of the 12 yo Glenmorangie Nectar D’Or month’s ago that it might be my first and last go at it. I enjoy trying out alternative casks and reviews seemed positive enough to seek it out. 

First impressions, this does seem a bit over packaged (the other “Extra-Matured” offerings don’t seem to suffer from that). But I suppose that’s part of vividly marketing the prestige of the Sauternes casks employed here. I usually see this type of packaging for 18 yo+. 

I typically don’t remark on the color of the dram because so often it’s been unnaturally tinkered with. (And while I’m at it, there are a lot more qualified folks to wax poetic about most spirits out there so I find these reviews are nice touchstones for myself to remind me of my impressions and details I liked/didn’t like about a particular pour.) 

The nose: sweet lime, apricots, lemon scones, and light-grade honey. 

On the palate, it’s a medium-bodied pleaser. Notes of lemon, ginger, honeycomb, and dessert (lemon pie?). What really impresses me is the bright acidity that balances the sweetness and oaky tannins. A sweet, tangy, and lightly-spiced finish. 92 proof is a nice touch too. I haven’t tasted many whiskies in a similar vein.  

All in all, I really enjoyed this well-balanced offering from Glenmorangie, and I’m very curious to see how it stacks up against the new NAS offering. The fact that I am debating squirreling an “old” bottle away betrays how enjoyable this is for a summertime dram. Solid and delicious. 

4.0 ~ 87 ~ Great"
5.0,"For my tastes, this is as close to perfection as I could get.  Sweet, smooth and everything I want in a delicious single malt."
3.75,"Stone fruit, lemon with a hint of smoke and oaky chardonnay on the nose, the palate is smooth and creamy, a little nutty and oaky, the light smoke makes a reprise on the medium length finish. This was quite hot when first tasted, after it sat for 1/2 hour the heat dissipated."

2.0,"Nose:  Sweet sugar notes, vanilla, peach, musty funky notes that come from that wine finish, a little bit of grapey background funk as well, and a hint of orange peel.

Flavor:  Very thick and buttery but far too sweet for my liking.  Nondescript sweet wine notes overpower any other flavors I'm trying to get.

Finish:  Shorter than the other varieties with light barrel char and heavy grapey sweet wine notes.  Finishes sweet transitioning to a little bit of a drying barrel note and then gone.

Kind of disappointing.  Too much sweet wine flavor that masks everything else.  Not a fan.  This is my first sauternes finished whiskey and I'm thinking I'll avoid in the future."

2.25,"I’ve tried to like this on several occasions but I just can’t get into it. My folks are wine people, but they’ve been thoughtful and stocked some bourbon and single malt at their house for when I come to visit. A friend of my father’s recommended this one to him, but he doesn’t drink it, and it just isn’t to my liking (to be fair I’ve been frequenting the Talisker and cask strength bourbon lately). 

The nose is light and fruity. Classic Glenmo with some extra peaches and cream. Not unpleasant in the least. Palate is light and malty, with a concentrated burst of sweetness reminiscent of the Italian desert wines my family drinks at special celebrations. The finish is where this one fails for me. It’s somehow both overly sweet and overly tannic at the same time, which smacks of poor casks (as Ralfy would say). With Glenmo’s huge output, it could be that this batch just ran afoul of some poor barrel quality. 

I can see how this appeals to some folks, but as is common in whisky reviews, we all have our preferences, and this one just doesn’t do it for me. Cheers!"

2.75,"Bought a Glenmorangie taster pack conataining this one, the 10yo, the Lasanta and the Quinta Ruban. Kudos to Glenmorangie for offering this pack - more destilleries should offer such packs!

Nose: Melted butter. A lot of melted butter.   Then comes an almondy sweetness, like marzipan. It’s very sweet. A hint of a (white) winey note as well. 

Palate: Like the nose; Marzipan and sugars. Some light fruits, but they are mostly overpowered by the sweetness. The texture is quite smooth.

Finish: Quite short actually. Same notes as on the palate. A bit dissapointing. 

Overall: I had higher hoped for this one. It is a good and tasty whisky for sure and a good sipper, but a bit too sweet and one-dimensional to achieve a higher score than 2.75 (i.e. definitely ok, but very far from great). I’d recomend the Quinta Ruban over this, which has got significantly more depth in my opinion. It still beats the Lasanta though and it’s probably about on par with the 10yo imo."

3.75,"On the nose, a gorgeous bouquet of vanilla and honey. Like a bourbon nose without the corn oversweetness or the oak sting. Smooth and velvety on the palate. More honey, more vanilla, and nice earthy cereal. Nice long finish due to the viscosity, but right beforehand, a nice little bite to let you know it's there."
3.75,"When it was announced that Glenmorangie was breaking up their 12-year line up, I decided that was the time to get the remaining bottles. I already had the Quinta Ruban, which I scored a solid 4.0.

This Nectar D'Or has been renamed the ""Sauternes Cask Finish,"" and has dropped from 12 y.o. to NAS. I'm sure I'll one day grab the NAS to compare, but for now let's see how the most expensive of the original 12 year trio rates.

Nose: Sweet all the way through. Vanilla, honey, (vanilla) icing. White grape (I'm far from a wine expert but it's darker, like a pinot grigio) and orange citrus, and raisin.Floral and malty. No trace of ethanol. Not too complex, but very inviting.

Palate: It's a dessert whisky if I've ever had one. More vanilla and honey, as well as orange and raisin. Classic Glenmorangie apple and pear add a layer of fruity sweetness. Malt and toffee. Almond and hazelnut appear on the mid-palate, followed by a hit of cinnamon and oak.

Finish: The cinnamon and oak persist into the finish, playing along with the vanilla and honey sweetness. When the sweetness dissipates, those notes are replaced with the almond and hazelnut, which ride out alongside the cinnamon, oak, and baking spices to the end of what makes for a moderate length finish.

Good stuff here. I've got nothing to compare this to in terms of Sauternes finished whiskies, so instead I'll turn to its peer, the Quinta Ruban. Judging them strictly on the experience, they're quite similar. The port cask delivers more complexity to the QR, if anything. I feel the respective black and white colored packing were aptly chosen. The QR is jammy, dark, and juicy, while the ND is light, airy, and sweet.

Which is better? Factoring price, the QR. The Nectar D'or commands, on average, a $15 premium over its 12-year counterparts. Personally, I don't see any reason why this one should be priced ahead of the QR and LS. Maybe the rarity of quality Sauternes Casks? That's all I can come up with.

At any rate, this is good stuff. Perfect choice for a background whisky and is a great choice for a fan of the Speyside/Highland profile looking to branch out. At $68, I don't regret my purchase, but understand full well that there are better options in this range. It's a good malt that I hope won't be ruined by a dip in age. Overall, pleasant experience; would consider grabbing another before the 12 year expression is totally extinct."

3.25,"A Highland single malt character, amplified with dessert wine casks.  The finish is candied ginger, verging on citrus, before the oak dryness shows up.  Adding water transforms it into a bourbon-cask scotch with a white wine influence.  Every once in a while, a decent honey note appears .  To me, this Glenmorangie (and the Quinta Ruban) are different from other scotches in that their taste profiles seem more candy sweet than fruit sweet.

Actually the whole profile is a bit alike Glenmorangie's best expression (in my book that is), the Signet.

46%abv a little high for glenmorangie, actually delivers a lot of flavor, although the palate is were it dropped some points.

On the nose: Vanilla, Clove, Wine
Chocolate, Lemon, Citrus and Complex. Nice.

On the palate: Honey, Oak, Chocolate and Oranges.

Nice long finish, sweet with a little burn sensation and maybe smoke (i dont think smoke should be there but it kinda is).

Overall i give this dram an 89 over 100, almost a 4.5. Go pick it up."
