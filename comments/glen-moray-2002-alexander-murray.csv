3.75,"Found this at Costco a couple months ago. $28.99 for a cask strength, 12 year old, single malt scotch. Too good of a deal to pass up. 
Initially I get Dole fruit cocktail syrup on the nose, after a few minutes it morphs into salty caramel apple and some apricot type notes. The palate is initially salty with stone fruits, but the heat overwhelms my taste buds very quickly. There's a short sour note on the lengthy, spicy finish. 
A splash of water mutes the heat on the palate and brings forth some caramel, it also seems to eliminate the sour note on the finish."
