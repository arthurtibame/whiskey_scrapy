3.0,"[Revisited 03/05/16] My first Irish whiskey.  I feel like I write about this one constantly, as every time I have a glass of this I am returned to a nostalgic moment where discovering this for the first time was just amazing. This most recent experience, I noticed a very nice bourbon cask finish that reedema this whiskey from what I once knew it as. I really must get another bottle of this and keep it as a reminder of my roots in whiskey drinking!"

3.0,"A standard Irish Whiskey nose, on par with Jameson: cereal, straw, vanilla and honey. Soft, silky texture that leads with honey sweetness that lingers for some time, but then fades like a quick dream, and turns spicy and hot.  And as quickly as that spiciness arrives, just as a summer breeze, fades and your left with a palate of orange zest and oak tannins.  All-in-all, this is a Jameson's twin brother with a bit more body. [84/100] [Tasted: 3/12/16 @ Bluestone Tavern]"

4.0,"Irish whiskey and I have a love/hate relationship. On the one hand, it's what made me a whiskey drinker back in college and seminary, and it's easy to see why - good Irish whiskey is smooth as silk, goes down easy, and has some personality (but not *too* much). On the other hand, I can already bet on what flavor notes I'm likely to find in the glass just because it's Irish. Powers Gold Label is perhaps the pinnacle of this reality. It is super smooth, with a sweet, luscious nose full of buttery malt, vanilla, honey, and spice...and the palate matches the nose, with just that hint of something slightly green and vegetal mid-palate. It's pleasant, reliable, and as comfy as warm PJ pants on a cold night...drink this one with family and friends around a fire pit, and you're in for a great time. Sure, it tastes like a stereotypical Irish whiskey. It's not going to blow your mind with its originality or chutzpah. But, sometimes, that's just fine by me, and it's why this one stays on my shelf."
4.0,"Irish cream! This has the typical characteristics that makes it obvious its blended. Having said that pleanty of honey and spice on the nose. To taste… the opening statement! It tastes up front like Irish Cream. As it levels out you can taste the American charred honey oak, spice, fruit and just a hint of smoke. It is complex and completely unique (to my scotch exclusive tastes at least). It may be blended but its still smooth and oily with pleanty to offer, expessially for the price point. Recommended"

3.0,"The Bottle: Fairly straight-forward.  The label isn't flashy or overstated, though it does contain a fair bit of good information about the contents of the bottle(pot still, triple distillation, non-chill filtered, etc.)

In the Glass: It doesn't say that it's a natural color; but if there is any use of spirit caramel in here, I think that it's fairly restrained.  The color is fairly brassy.

On the Nose: Quite savory, actually.  There's that typical ""Irish Whiskey"" thing going on, but it isn't as blatant as I've seen in some other blends.  The barley is at the forefront with some of the honeyed notes sitting in the back.  A hint of the typical ""whiskey baking spices"" in the background as well.  This isn't terribly complex, but I also don't think that it's trying to be.

Taste:  There's practically no arrival to this stuff, it just moves straight into the development.  It's kind of amazing how it goes from so little to so much in terms of flavor.  The development is a lot of savory barley blended with cinnamon and sandwiched into layers of honey.  That may sound kind of ridiculous, but this stuff does a good dry/sweet balancing act.  It finishes with an astringency that has a nice bitterness lingering around the tongue.

This is one of the better of the affordable Irish whiskeys out there that I've come across.  It isn't overly sweet or overly processed and the ""handcrafted"" marketing on the label doesn't seem to be completely made of fluff(which is nice, for a change).  This would be a perfect ""session"" kind of drinking whiskey for a gathering of friends around a card table.  Good value for the money."

4.25,"Nose:  Bright green apple, vanilla, toffee, a bit of cinnamon.  Warm butter and honey with a flighty floral note that's hard to pin down.

Palate:  Like silk on the tongue.  Creamy, sweet vanilla cake, delicate orange frosting, cinnamon and clove bite.  An almost floral spice note, like cardamom.  Green pear and soft apple.  More floral notes that accompany the honey, right before the spicy kick.

Finish:  Medium.  Absolutely mouthwatering.  Sweet and buttery throughout, with lingering potstill spices that come in waves.

Conclusion:  This is hard to beat for the price.  At $30 a bottle, I would be challenged to come up with a better whiskey for the price, across ALL categories.  I have a love for pot still whiskey, so you could call me biased, but if I had to choose one bottle to keep in stock all the time, this would be it."

3.75,"Powers Gold is a robust, flavorful example of the Irish whiskey style.  There is honey, vanilla, wood spice, a hint of malt from the pot still portion and a heavier mouthfeel than the typical standard Irish.  Overall, I would say this rates at the next step over the other standard Irish offerings.  Jameson is sweeter and Bushmills has less spice if that is what you want (and sometimes I do), but Powers offers much more flavor."

My absolute favorite to order at an irish pub. Cheap, delicious and quintessential Irish whiskey. Lovely, creamy mouthfeel throughout the entire experience. Vanilla passes from the nose, to palate to finish. Biscuits and tropical fruits round this out. Not the longest finish ever, but the value is unbeatable for how good this whiskey is. One of the most underrated out there"

4.0,For a $30 price point (Oregon) this is a damned solid value! It definitely punches above its weight...I think it’s nearly as good as Tullamore 12. NEARLY. This has a lot of the rich sherry notes in it which suggests a high content of single malt in the blend.

4.0,"This is, in my opinion, the best of the basic Irish Whiskeys. These are Bushmills, Tullamore Dew, Jameson, and Powers. I know there are a lot of other Irish whiskeys out there but I find these four in every liquor store I go into. I have had all of these either at friends or for my own bar and the Gold Label Powers is by far the best of the group. It has a fuller flavor with light vanilla and caramel(maybe) notes on the nose. It is an Irish whiskey so it is smooth and lighter flavored but it is so much better than its competition it even has more flavor than most Canadian whiskeys as well. It is a fine everyday drinker and if you want to mix it feel free to. It is an introductory whiskey in the line play with it. It is $28 around where I live which puts it right in the wheelhouse of all of the Irish whiskeys. I really like this even though it does not have the depth older whiskeys or bourbon it is still good. Enjoy."

However, Power's is a Middleton product and has been in the shadows of Jameson for some time. It is a fuller and more robust whiskey than Jameson and Paddy's. Heavier than Bushmills but a bit less flavorful than Tullamore. I will probably pass on Power's Gold Label and reach for the Powers Three Swallow SINGLE POT, only because Gold label is properly priced with the entry level Irish whiskey. Would definitely choose Power's over ""Jame-o"" as Jameson tends to be a shot whiskey."

4.0,"I ran out of Irish whiskey a while back, and for whatever reason (mostly Scotch...) I've dragged my feet on replacing a bottle in my stocks. I absolutely ADORE Redbreast 12, but for whatever reason the $60 price point has been a turn off recently. Not sure why since I'm perfectly willing to drop more than that on good Scotch...anyhoo, I was wandering around at Total Wine and saw this for $30 in a sleek new bottle (yes, packing works on me. Commence pointing and laughing) and made an impulse buy. I tried the Powers 12 Year John's Lane a while back and found it a bit harsh, so I had low expectations, but wow! This wins the slugfest for best budget Irish by a longshot!

Nose has all the expected buttery, shortbread notes with some of that pot still spice poking through. Taste follows suit. Lots of buttery, vanilla notes. Don't detect any sherry cask but honestly I feel like it's not necessary. There's a long, spicy finish that entices me back for more until I realize that my glass is empty. Even though this is a blend, I don't get any harsh, metallic grain notes like on Black Bush or Jameson, and I like the higher ABV. Seems like they were going for a quality product over mass production (though I suspect there's that too). There's clearly a high proportion of that Powers aggressive house pot still style in this, but it's rounded off by the grain, and I actually find myself enjoying it more than the John's Lane. Whoda thunk?!

This gets to stay. This is my new favorite affordable Irish. I still love the Redbreast, and I'm sure it'll be back, but for now, this is a fine, everyday placeholder. Cheers!"
