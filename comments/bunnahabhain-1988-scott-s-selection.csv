2.5,"Distilled 1988.  Bottled 2004.  Cask strength.  No cask type information.  53.8%.

Sometimes, Scotch from yesteryear is not clearly better than the industrialized, engineered, formulaic Scotch from today.  There are distilleries that are releasing their best stuff today; right now; in the modern times.  Bunnahabhain is one of those distilleries.

That does not mean this 1988 vintage bottled by “Scott’s Selection” is bad.  I’ve had other Scott’s Selection before, and they release honest whisky that tends to not sell, gather dust on shelves, and not appreciate on the secondary market.  They knew how to mature whisky, as their bottlings have identity and direction, but I have a feeling they were working with cheap, flawed casks.  This bottler has been extinct for a few years, and no bottle flipper has so much as flinched.

This Bunna approaches you with the lovely aromas of lemon confit; brined zesty fruits and flowers.  It’s got a rose that grew from concrete swagger.  There’s very faint peat.  Vanilla ice cream.  A little soapiness.  The sweet citrus evolves to something very mineral and salty in the mouth.  There’s a peppery finish with oakiness that is a little too harsh, and lasts a little too long.  Some water is recommended, as it brings out some chocolate and tobacco notes.

This is a bottle I don’t regret buying; it’s enjoyable, but not memorable.  Comparing this to a modern Bunna 12, which is so much sweeter and genetically modified to taste better than Coke... I can’t say for sure the oldie is better.

Score: 0 (forgettable)
How much does a bottle cost: Probably secondary market only.  Should be around $150.
How much do I think a bottle is worth: $85"
