3.0,"Visually, this bourbon mash moonshine is clear as water. And thin semi-oily legs slowly go back down the glass.

The nose isn’t very complicated, but either by the power of suggestion in its name or otherwise, it does present as “fresh.” There are notes of corn dust, ethanol, granola cereal, minty toothpaste, and inoffensive cleaning products.

The palate has a creamy mouthfeel, with notes of corn, watermelon candy, and basil leaves. But it leaves you feeling fresh like Colorado snow.

The finish is long-standing but slowly fades with sweetness and a clean aftertaste.

This is one fine clear spirit. Obviously its bourbon counterpart is far superior, but as a raw unaged whiskey it is quite respectable! I like it, and recommend a taste. Thanks 291! Cheers!"
