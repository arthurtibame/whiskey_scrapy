3.5,"Floral, spice and sweet."
2.5,"Pleasant, light nose. Unfortunately some young notes. On the palate, floral at first, a flash of cola/caramel, then very velvety, with light spice hitting the back of the throat, not on the tongue. Finish is short, with a bitter note. The soft middle is interesting. 5/26/19"
