3.0,"I got a chance to sample this at a bar recently and I found it a very pleasant dram.  The nose features a nice mix of honey, vanilla and grain notes.  These flavors are repeated on the palate but a hint of sherry is lurking beneath the surface to keep things interesting.  On the negative side, the mouth feel is a bit thin (you could call it ""light"" if you're being charitable) and the finish is quite short - don't even think of adding water to this whisky.  Overall, The Glenrothes Vintage Reserve is not what I would call an overtly complex or bold scotch, but sometimes you're in the mood for something mellow and this fits the bill quite nicely."

3.0,This is a very light whiskey.  I disagree with the thought that it lacks complexity.  There are several different layers of flavors. Honey and vanilla are the first wave followed by the floral notes.  Great bottle for the Spring.

3.0,"Valentines Gift from my lovely wife! The nose is a huge floral bouquet. It's quite light and single note, but pleasant and not overly sweet. It's simple but enjoyable. I think it'll make for a nice relaxing dram!"

4.0,Very sweet on the nose. Light on the palate. Got a very strong cigar-like tobacco on the back end.

3.0,"The first thing you experience in this whiskey is a nose with hints of brown sugar and vanilla. Inside your mouth you're welcomed with more bourbon than sherry, with oak really taking dominance.  The body is regretfully light, almost to the point of being ridiculous, and the finish is terribly short. This isn't a bad whiskey. Simply an uninspiring one."

3.0,good. sweet with slight peaty flavor. Nothing mind blowing but smooth
1.0,"Maybe it was a bad batch (50 ml) but this tasted like straight ass. The nose was musty and the same note followed thru to the palate. 

I’m an islay guy too so I’m ready to try “heavy stuff” but this taste like straight booty."

4.0,"Really interesting dram. The initial scent I find is fresh hay. Cereal, a bit of citrus zest, cinnamon and clove are also there. Full mouth feel and very smooth but then something really interesting happens after the slight heat at the end, all of a sudden is gone with such a subtle finish. It is like star fruit if you have ever had it. You eat it and it is crisp and juicy and once you swallow, almost nothing. 🥃"

2.75,"Very interesting and unusual.
Light golden colour with some brown flake. 
Cloves and dark honey are primary to the nose. Then come tones of fresh green apples (as it is with Balblair, also a vintage), some citruses, vanilla and caramel.
The taste is totally smooth, even watery, no spiritous notes at all. Pleasant, mouthfeeling but not very well balanced.
Again - much honey, apples, a bit of spices.
Finish is real good. It can be truly identified with bourbon (Buffalo Trace, perhaps) if we'd judge it only by its aftertaste. It’s long, sweet, full of nuts and wild berries.
Glenrothes is ultimately satisfying, intriguing (mostly due to its incredible aroma) but lacks a bit of a balance. A perfect whiskey to get acknowledged with the distillery and not a bad partner for a lonely night or cigar."

3.75,"My scoring system often gets me high points for some whiskies, and even with that system this dram couldn't make it to 4.0. Don't get me wrong, it is not a bad dram at all, but what it has in complexity on the nose just couldn't deliver into the palate and the finish is way to short and a little boring.

Bottled at 40%abv, golden color.

On the nose is quite a jewel. Lots of aroma notes:Hazelnut, Cocoa Milk powder, Wedding cake, Raisins, Nice aroma not savage nor dim, After a while pear or green apples appear, After a longer while lemonade appears. Prunes also.

On the palate is easy, with Almonds, Nutty and Oaky, Cinnamon and Plain old wood. Finish is very short with cinnamon hints. 

Overall i give this dram a 79 over 100, and that is because the nose is so great."
