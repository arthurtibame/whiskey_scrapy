2.0,"A smidge too sweet for my liking, but neither abrasive nor syrupy. Expected to feel like I was drinking cough syrup with whiskey and was pleasantly surprised with how palatable this whiskey is. Best enjoyed as a mixer (lemonade, sangria, or a little soda with lime twist). My personal favorite application being a couple of swirls over the top of a Manhattan. Far better than maraschino juice or liqueur, and a great substitute for grenadine."
2.0,"A little over the edge in terms of sweetness for my liking, but it makes a hell of a replacement for things like grenadine or maraschino liqueur in cocktails."
