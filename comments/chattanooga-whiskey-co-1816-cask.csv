3.0,"A nice high proof, with a nose of sandalwood and vanilla.
    Notes of citrus on the pallet.  Strong burn, it could be smoother. A quick finish that could linger longer, in my opinion. A very good mix whiskey, perfect for an Old Fashion"

4.0,"This is the first real premium bourbon to touch my pallet. Stopped by the new distillery and picked up a bottle while on vacation. I love the cask richness and flavor. Despite the high proof it is a good smooth sipper. I try to keep a bottle of the cask and reserve on hand. If your ever in Chattanooga drop by and have a taste, you won't be disappointed.

Chattanooga, TN, $43
Ezra 's mail order. $48"

null,"Very good whiskey, better with a splash of water."
3.0,Bought during Christmas. Had to wait until added to list. Not a bad whiskey but very potent. Enjoyed mostly as an Old Fashioned.

4.0,"Over ice ball. Spicy nose with just a hint of brown sugar. Taste initially alcohol but mellows quickly enough to get more caramel, toffee, leather with some baking spice before the finish starts with some mild burn with cinnamon and oak that’s decent but wish it was a bit longer"

1.0,burn. proof 113. too high
3.0,Great flavors throughout with a front note of oak and vanilla and a lasting finish of rich earth notes. Approach with caution as is high proof.

4.0,Pretty good...not much burn at all 4 a cask strength imo but has a nice flavor
3.25,"Color is medium amber
Nose is cereal grain, perhaps a bit of leather
Tastes of rye spice, ginger and cinnamon balanced by a bit of raisin and a long oaky, peppery finish
Not super smooth, a bit hot"

3.0,"Nose-Very little astringency given the high proofing. Sweet tea with lemon. 
Body- A bit of lemon tartness hits first, then the tannins and brown sugar of sweet tea. There are loads of pepper and backing spices. 
Nose- Sweetness gives way to a tartness and perhaps a hint of brine. Is this a high rye? A good, approachable cask strength."

3.75,"Nose:  The pungent alcohol burn arrives first,  followed with sweet florals,  honey, rye spice.   Lots of body and full characteristics of a barrel proof, promising. 

Hot spices and notes of toast and barrel guts ride on the spice warmth and subdued sugars, are first with less dark sugar complexity than is promised by the nose richness.  Finishing dryer with hints of the cask mustiness and bits of acrid citruses.  For an MGP product this is an all together different and unique offering with some very interesting characteristics. 

Adding a couple of thimbles of water and allowing this to breath for a bit -  not much changes at the top, still a good bit of tangy richness. Little change as the harshness holds with mild sweet and spice and a somewhat easier finish.

The buzz on this from whiskey review is somewhat warranted, but only somewhat. With the myriad of bibs, cask and barrel strengths available today the 1816 Cask isn't the standout it might have been say 10 years ago, however it speaks to the hard core bourbon drinkers among us and to date easily tops the arrivals with the Chattanooga label."

4.25,"Nose - (w/o water) Spicy sweet bbq?, paprika, hickory, salt, caramel, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice (w/ water) More rounded, some sweet-savory funk but less bbq, more cloves, allspice

Taste - (w/o water) Very drying, bit hot, cinnamon red hots, light salt, pie crust, light graham cracker, dark caramel, hint of black tea (w/ water) Less drying, cherry cinnamon red hots, light salt, dark caramel, hint of chocolate

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering cinnamon spice/tingle, sweet pie spices, sweet paprika, vanilla caramel (w/ water) Less tingle, more black tea bitter, vanilla, caramel

Score - 89/100

Final Thoughts - This one was quite interesting and not at all what I expected. The nose itself was way out there but it didn't really reflect on the palate. It was funky but in a good interesting way. Flavors not typical in your ""standard"" bourbon, but still close enough to let you know it's a bourbon. This is an interesting one for sure in that I think it'd pair either with savory foods or a good pecan pie, but seems a bit off for a daily sipper.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - Probably not?"
4.25,"I’ve heard good things about this and finally decided to try it. Though I’m not sure how easily I will be able to find this variant (their sourced MGP barrels) now that they have been making their own product.

The nose at first had some heat to it, but after a few minutes in the glass, the vapors subside and allow brown sugar, some oak and baking spices to come through. After the first sip I get some apricot.

The palate is very oaky in a great way. Sort of reminds me of my Stagg Jr., just not nearly as hot. You also get some sweet cola notes and leather. And hint of fruit on the very back. It definitely drys the tongue.

The finish has a nice initial burn and then follows through nicely, long length.

Also tried it with a few drops of water. It mellows it out, but didn’t bring anything else out of the mix.

Wow, this is really good. Now I see why the guy at the store was suggesting that I might not want to try it, since it’s their old product they don’t make anymore. I guess I’ll have to stock up on it."
