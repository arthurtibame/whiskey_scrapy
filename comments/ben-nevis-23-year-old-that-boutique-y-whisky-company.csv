3.75,"(Batch 10)

This is a thick, oily dram.  It tastes almost syrupy with bitter citrus and chocolate caramel.  It ends on a buttery ginger note that lasts for ages.  Typical of Ben Nevis’ older whiskies, it’s layered and complex.  This one is growing on me the more I have.  All-in-all, pretty good."
