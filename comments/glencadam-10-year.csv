3.0,"Colour is urine-pale, with spotty legs. Smell is barley sugar, lemon, unripe orchard fruits and slight stone fruits: a bit of pear or apple skin, slightly sugary. An initial spirity ""white grape"" kind of flavour I often associate with young malts. Taste has an initial sweetness, like watered down maple syrup, then lemon candies and more fruitiness. Crab apples?  Slightly peppery. I don't quite get Distiller's insistence about ""spice"" here, though it does have a bit more kick than the standard 'fiddich/'livet ""glens"". A touch of black tea. Faint berries, maybe even a nuttiness. Short finish, but pleasant ( a nice green apple tart sweetness). Hard to rate--it hovers around the same price as a lot of entry level single malts and hits many of the same notes, though in a way that's different enough to at least change things up. I won't replace the bottle once it's done (there's just so much out there), but the profile and the price make it pretty darn drinkable. Craft presentation is a distinct plus, too."

4.0,"Surprisingly tasty! Very bright at the onset with a very floral taste. It is packed with flavor to start, then settles down, but has a good bit of the good type of burn on the back end."

4.5,"Let me start off by saying that this whisky is extremely underrated and underappreciated. The review posted here is...bullocks! The only thing that I can think of, is that this place was mothballed for a while. Maybe it's different stuff?
Age:10
Nose:apple, vanilla, banana 
Palate:fairly viscous at 46%. You're taken on this amazing flavor journey that starts off as bright and citrusy grapefruit, and then transforms into apple vanilla cake, and then finishes with unripened banana. 
Finish:That fruitiness is what stays with you. So incredibly pleasant. 
I can thank a local lq manager for suggesting this. It shows you that a great whisky doesn't have to be something that everyone is chasing down. This is a diamond in the rough. If you love Irish whiskey, you will also love this. In fact, you might freak out for this."

3.5,"Don't agree with the official review, this is a lot sweeter and perfumy than described for me. A great bottle for it's price and with lots of character."
3.5,"Nice and summery malt. No coloring and not chill filtered, so tastes quite rich also. Creamy and hay etc. Not too special, but I recommond to try."

3.75,"Very light yellow color, probably the lightest I have had. Aroma is floral with a hint of fruit, but distinctly Scotch in a good way. Taste starts sweet and fruity but then lets in hints of smoke. A little bitterness on the back of the tongue to finish, but quite pleasant. A touch of water brightens it up a bit. All around I really like this and would need to seek out its older siblings."

3.0,not really bad. if you can get it for a good price it might be a simple sipper if it's your style. middle of the road.
3.0,"Light, grassy, a bit sweet. @brent got it right in our blind tasting. Great budget buy, but not something I’d seek out."
3.0,Meh.

3.0,"Vanilla, marzipan, citrus, charred oak on the nose. Light bodied, with some citrus, tropical fruit, malt, and hints of roasted almonds on the palate. Smooth and lightly spiced finish of medium length. Not bad, but not the most interesting dram."
3.0,"Nose: Initially there is a strong grassy citrus and vanilla combination. Also some light cereal notes, pears, stone fruits, hard candy and a luscious light oily aroma. It's refreshing and sprightly, but by no means lightweight - lean but strong like an Olympic gymnast. [The dry glass aroma is faint fruit and sweets].

 Palate: More forceful than I was expecting. Crisp, clean and refined arrival focusing on citrus/cereal notes. A creamy, buttery mouthfeel with a hint of waxy sourness, and some brisk spicy tannins (weak tea and a hint of star anise).

Finish: Medium. Juicy with a flavour of white grapes and gristy cereals.

A fruity and cereal centred spirit, barely a hint of the casks, which I bet were exclusively bourbon casks.

Initially I thought this might be a ""summery"" type of light whisky, but there is more going on then that. If you are a fan of sherry bombs or sticky, sweet spirit, or wood influence ... steer clear, this won't excite you. If you like a lightly bourbon influenced, dry, spirity malt with a sweet and spicy kick - well here it is.  There's even a little brininess about it and something almost Old Pulteney in the profile.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"
3.0,"A surprising nose, and probably a combination of aromas I've never come across before. It's like Christmas spice cake with chopped candied fruits - I very much enjoy it. The palate is incredibly smooth, and a delight, with a generous dose of almonds. The finish is were things regretfully veer off, with a certain bitterness no amount of water can tame. It's too bad... Still I recommend trying."
