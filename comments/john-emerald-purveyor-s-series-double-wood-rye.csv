2.5,"I wanted to like this. I really did. The distillery is about 10 minutes from my alma mater (WDE). But this is really terrible. I hate peat and smoke. So their decision to add charred pecans to this as it ages makes it a total dud to me. I taste really no classic 'rye' flavors. The tiniest bit of pepper, no dill, nothing. Just Sharpie on the nose and campfire on the palate.  I think I'll tuck this away until scoth drinkers come to town. Maybe they will be able to appreciate it. But unfortunately, I cannot."
4.0,"Smooth and light forward, dry with a spice across it. Has a hint of pecan on the finish."
