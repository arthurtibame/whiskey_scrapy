5.0,"The Arran 10, a 10 year old single malt scotch whisky hailing from the Island region. Price $60.00 Sampled 12/9/15 with 3/4 teaspoon of water in a Glencairn spirits nosing glass.

Aroma - Slight salt brine, currants, heavy bourbon influences, vanilla, prune, toffee, malty and light blueberry.

Taste - Cherry, heavy bourbon flavors, oranges and almond.

Finishes with a medium lingering flavor and burn.

Final score : 5 / 5, will definitely be buying again."
4.0,"Unik 10-åring slik eg ser det. Velutvikla kompleksitet, men smidig og behagelig. Passa dei fleste anledninga. Ligge nær sine venna frå vestkysten i feeling, spesielt Oban, Talisker og Ledaig, men òg Old Pultney frå litt lenger nord. Dessuten eit kupp til den prisen."

4.0,"The aroma reminds me initially of the Classic Laddie 10; it's light, forwardly salty (think seagulls calling), and floral, later bringing baked apples to mind. The palate doesn't offer surprises but well reinforces the aroma with the cursory first sip — it's delicate, salty, spiceful in its maltiness, and burns early. Throughout, there are hints of sour apple, toasted oats, and an impression of an evening walk through a citrus grove in full bloom. This dram leaves with a cereal-heavy finish of medium length. Simple, light, and floral; an intriguing introduction to the Arran Malt."

4.0,"Being a rather young distillery (ESTḌ 1995), Isle of Arran is already producing some cracking good whisky. The use of high-quality casks, 46% ABV, no chill-filtration and natural color gives you an optimal version of a Single Malt. Unlike other Island whiskies, Arran 10 features an unusual tropical character. On the nose, there are exotic fruits, such as papaya, melon and kiwi. Tasting mildly spicy and almost syrupy, faint hints of oak combine with cinnamon, sweet vanilla and complex fruity notes. It's a characterful dram with a gentle and bittersweet finish.

RATING: 3.9/5.0 stars ≙ 86 pts → FIRST-CLASS [-]"

4.0,"In the Glass:  Lemon yellow, almost like a Chardonnay. 
On the Nose:  Fresh fruit and some hints a sweet white wine, almost mead-like. 
Taste:  More fresh fruit. A slight bitter note on the finish, but this subsides after a few minutes in the glass. A few drops of water helps open it further, as it's bottled at 46%; but too much water will easily drown it. 

This is a very pleasant and delicate malt with no chill-filtration or caramel colorant added. Very fruit-forward and seemingly unapologetic about it.
Very well made spirit and good value for the money, I look forward to trying some of their other releases."

3.0,"Doesn't do much for me this one. Slightly rough and don't get much distinct flavour. Both times I've tried at tastings it's been newly opened bottles and its been one of many whiskies which may have an impact. One tasting I tried this at was a flight of Arran whiskys and the 14 and sauternes finish comfortably bested this. Wouldn't say the distillery as a whole does much for me though. Definitely a high 2+, low 3 rating. If there was a 2.5 stars this would be it"

4.0,"The nose is light and sweet with pear and honey and just a touch of sherry. The sherry is more pronounced on the palate, but still not dominant. Pear, apricot, red apple and a little heat appear as well. The finish is fairly short and a little hot. More pear, apricot and apricot, but less sweet. Overall, this has some nice sherry influence that doesn't overpower other flavors. A little water really makes the fruit flavors stand out as well. At a reasonable price ($50 locally), this is a great value scotch."

null,"*Score* 84
*Color* Honey Gold.
*Nose* Honey, pronounced vanilla notes, lingering tingle of alcohol without the burn.
*Palate* Thin, clear.
*Finish* Short finish, flirting with floral that flutters away with the first sip.
*Notes* A gentle scotch, this is like a set of training wheels. Although you compromise for a lack of complexity. Even the burn down your throat isn’t harsh. A flat coating of butterscotch on the center of the tongue with a somewhat spicy tone coming on at the end. Overall, a rather neutral expression that doesn’t seem to want to pick a side. For example, it’s fruity with nondescript fruits. It’s a good gift scotch – classy enough to impress a non-expert while also not forcing on them something too smoky or peaty. At the same time, a connoisseur would appreciate the effort."

4.0,"Wow! This is great stuff, the Distiller expert rating and the average rating here are misleading. Clean and fresh nose, a lovely creamy texture, green apples, cereal, honey, lemon peel and sea salt on the palate followed by a sour finish that slowly turns dry. 46% ABV, non-chillfiltered, natural colour. I'm falling in love with Arran, cheers fellow addicts!"

4.0,"It’s nice to see new distilleries still making honest whisky.  Age statement, 46%, non-chillfiltered, a clear bottle that does not hide its pale beauty, and a faint meaty bold Mortlachian, Craigellachian character lurking in a slyly light body.
        
        Grassy, walnuts, cereal, and underripe melons and coconuts on the nose.  On the palate, somehow light and oily at the same time.  A little salt and tanginess makes it pop.  A definite mineral finish with vanilla and a complementary slight Sulphur.
        
        I recently opened this bottle, and I am impressed so far.  I will be enjoying this and, probably, plenty more Arran expressions in the future.

4.0,"Distillerie: Isle of Arran Distillers Ltd.
Nom: The Arran Malt 10 ans Scotch Single Malt
Région: Écosse, Île d’Arran
Couleur: Couleur naturelle d’un jaune doré très pâle
Alcool: 46%, non filtré à froid


NEZ
Un nez très doux qui m’apporte de la purée de banane et beaucoup de pomme verte acidulée et légèrement salée.  Le biscuit à l’avoine fait sont entrée accompagné de gingembre et d’un soupçon de vanille. Je reconnais au loin la pelouse fraîchement tondue et le retour du salé mais plus comme une huître dans son eau saumâtre. J’aimes beaucoup l’équilibre et la simplicité de la présentation.

BOUCHE
La bouche est fidèle au nez et sans grandes surprises si ce n’est son petit coté huileux de beurre salé.  L’équilibre y demeure et surtout la simplicité. Les saveurs sont exquises (banane, pomme verte, biscuit, herbes) sans être bien différentes de la livraison d’arômes du nez. Avec le temps, l’abricot séché et le cacao feront leur apparition.

FINALE
C’est moyennement long avec une persistance plus herbacée que fruitée.

VERDICT
Sans prétention,  peut être un peu trop simpliste (jeunesse oblige), mais un bel équilibre qui saura probablement plaire à plusieurs.

2.75,"Let's be clear: this is no Springbank 10, though it tastes like it wants to be. Still, as a whiskey with a clean highland flavor, it does work. Arran Robert Burns has more sulfur mixed with sweetness in a way that is drinkable, but is light and doesn't really balance. Arran 10 has a lot more grain on the nose, though there isn't a lot else and it's lighter on the nose overall. Arran 10 has a bit more floral nose, but also less apricot. The palate is smooth with a nice balanced sweetness that is fruity and floral predominantly, but then gives way to toasted grain and some smoke mixed with sea-spray. There's something a bit bitter in here too, though it's actually quite good despite being generic. There's a bit of nectar from the floral flavors and fruits, though it isn't super complex or rich and does have a young character to it. Overall, this whiskey tastes young, but well-executed for its age. It's nothing amazing, but it's perfectly sippable. I'm thinking 12-13. Maybe 14, but unlikely to be 15. Still, even at 15, there would be a respectable margin between it and Springbank 10 that would make a lot of sense. It can have a 13 for now. A fresh sip shows a bit more youth and immaturity as the alcohol burns a bit more and the rich mellowness isn't as detectable. A bit more lemon and cream come through on the nose, reminding me of a lemon meringue pie. A bit more light apricot does come out too. The nose reminds me of Green Spot a bit. The palate has a bit more harshness in a way that reminds me of Dalwhinnie. It tastes very natural and ticks several boxes, but it's still remarkably average. I think it's a bit better than Arran Robert Burns, but it isn't better by much. It's light with floral and fruit flavors that are backed by some graininess and a bit of smoke with some alcohol bringing in a tad of numbing soapiness. It really reminds me a lot of Dalwhinnie 15. It's somehow less rich and smooth than Dalwhinnie 15 is and it lacks that hint of cherry. On the flip side, it also lacks that weird off taste and is a bit more balanced despite being less complex. This is definitely less mature with more of a bourbon barrel spiciness to it than Dalwhinnie 15. This reminds me of Dalwhinnie 15 crossed with Glenmorangie The Original. I'm not sure it's actually in between the two so much as comparable with the Glenmorangie. It's fine enough, but not super exciting. Definitely sippable though. I'm landing in the 13 to 14 range on this, but sticking with the 13 for now. If it weren't for the sulfur, it say the Robert Burns version was better. If it were better balanced too, it could be great."

3.0,"I have recently been able to acquire a few more 50ml sample bottles of single malts I have yet to try and review.  I've really been in the mood to try new stuff lately, so what better time than now to open these little minis.  Up next is the Arran 10 year old.  It's from the island region of Scotland, but it isn't an Islay-style peated malt.  It's a slightly elevated 92 proof and looks light and airy in the Glencairn.

The nose is typical light and floral with lots of vanilla, biscuits and fresh oak.  This already seems like a great springtime dram and since today is a very uncharacteristically warm, late December day I'd say it's appropriate.

On the palate it's very biscuity.  There's a bit of citrusy lemon that livens up everything, including the lengthy finish.  I wouldn't say it's complex, but that's understandable given its overall youth.  This would be a good pre-dinner scotch when fish or chicken is on the menu.  It really wakes up the tongue.  Very solid.

Overall, an excellent single malt that would kick off a light meal or a great whisky tasting.  Quality stuff.  Cheers."

But it's also interesting... I feel like I haven't really figured it out completely. I'd like to save some from this bottle and revisit it when my palette improves.

after having it again... it's malty. to me that's a kind of boring but mildly offensive carpety sick taste. it's interesting that I'm not detecting any fruity flavors in substantive ways... that probably means my palette is way underdeveloped."
