4.5,"Best Single grain whisky i have ever tasted. Period.

And it is from South Africa. 

Actually, one year ago, Bain's Cape Mountain Whisky standard single grain was the winner in World Whiskies Awards 2018. This is the 15yo old version of that one which was a 5yo dram. 

Bottled at 52.5%abv

On the nose, it is quite something. As soon as you remove the cork,  Rum and Molasses appear. Vanilla, Grain herbal typical note; Vanilla Cookies. Spiciness. Hard marshmallow (melcocha). Danish cookies (the ones that comes in a metal case). Vanilla ice cream. Super sweet as you can tell.

On the palate it has a perfect score. Dulce de leche, toffee, Vainilla; So pleasant and Creamy. 

The grainy aftertaste is spicy and full of vanilla. Very pleasant, For a grain whisky is great.

Overall, this is the most rewarding, sweet grain whisky i have ever had. Totally recommended. 94 over 100. Sláinte!"
4.25,"Picked up this bottle while on vacation in South Africa. The country is not necessarily known for whisky production, but I was very surprised. The liquid showed a pleasant pale gold color with a briny nose.  The flavor was slightly astringent which mellowed to mild oak and fruit. Overall very satisfied."
