5.0,"Happy 40th birthday to me! 

This 10 year (equivalent to 30 Scottish years per Amrut) sherry matured peated whiskey is everything I love in a dram.

Nose: light peat smoke, baking spices, orange peel, and lots of sherry. It needs to sit for a while or the ABV will blow out your sinuses.

Palate: lots of oak from the finishing bourbon and virgin oak barrels. Medium to mild peat.  Very little burn for 60% ABV. Figs, spice, honey, and vanilla. Just a hint of the Indian spice/cardamom character that I love in Amrut whiskies.

Finish: nice and long. Dry, smoky, and spicy, leaving the tongue tingling.

Well done Amrut. I can’t wait to get the next Greedy Angels edition when I turn 41!"
