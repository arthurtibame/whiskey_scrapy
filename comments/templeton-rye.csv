2.5,"Nose- Slightly astringent, Vanilla and a hint of pickle brine 
Body- Pickle brine, vanilla, and pepper continue with a thin mouthfeel. 
Finish- Very very easy drink with an easy, short finish. 

Like many ryes for me, the finish is easy but the body and initial flavor is meh."

It still has all of the rye spice goodness, but if you are looking for a rye that’ll beat you up a bit, and call you mean names. This isn’t it."

Palate: sweet with a tropical hint.
Finish: not quite able to place the flavor but not very sweet. But fades to a unsweetened fruit cocktail juice over time. 

Very drinkable!"

3.5,"Decent basic rye, not particularly complex.  Decent spicy rye flavor with a bit of ethanol.  Rye finish that lingers for a bit.  It's not anything special, but it's perfectly drinkable.  It's a little thin on the palate- I prefer all my whiskey on the oily side.  Would be better if it were higher proof.  Probably good to mix if you want something with a solid rye flavor shining through your mixer."

2.75,My second rye whiskey and not great. Bought a pint for $20 and figured if anything I'll keep the bottle for reuse. The taste is good with wood and nutty notes. There's a weird saltiness like hay. Finish is short and cool. Tastes young because it is young.

2.75,"In the nose I get rye spice with a decent amount of a note that I can only describe as a black sharpie marker. 
The palate is a little sweet with some spiciness and a generic cola flavor.
The finish is on the shorter side.
This on is ok, not the flavor profile I’m typically looking for."

Starts with a sweet ethanol burn with some vanilla and citrus, finishes with baking spices, rye spiciness and a MGP dill-note.

3.75,"Rye bread, brown sugar, candy apple, honey, vanilla on the noese with a mild rye and slight pepper almost caramel like body with a lengthy toffee and black pepper finish. 
Overall taste like a low rye mash, and really easy drinking"
3.0,"Nose: vanilla and banana comes through very strong.  Slight hint of cinnamon. 

Palate: mild which one would expect with an 80 proof.  Taste follows the nose bit is dominated with woody taste in the forefront 

Finish: smooth. No burn. Cinnamon dominates the finish. 

Overall: very mild.  I know the backstory on Templeton basically creating their legend and adding flavors so that is a huge strike against them, but it’s basically a very good tasting, mellow rye that those who are not whisky snobs would enjoy.  I personally like a more forward whiskey, but will probably keep this in my bar for individuals dipping their toes into the water."

3.0,"This rye whiskey is a conundrum.  Keeping away from anything having to do with marketing, I'll focus on taste.  This is sweet with a solid butterscotch note.  A bit of cedar in the background, along with some pepper, spices and a touch of vanilla.  It's quite tasty and very easy to drink, but at 80 proof I expect it to be easy.  It's a nice splash of rye to have neat or on the rocks, in a glencairn or from a flask.

I can't give this more than 3 stars even though I like it as much as most 3.5 star ryes I've had... when I have it neat.  It's tasty.  But.... It doesn't have the horsepower to make it in a cocktail, where its sweet and modest profile can be drowned by vermouth or even bitter amari.  On the rocks this is good, but NOT better than Lot 40, imho. Further, this Templeton expression isn't nearly as interseting as Crown Royal Nerthern Harvest rye.  I prefer the increased complexity and bolder profile of the Canuk whisky.  

I've tasted the 4yr in the past.  I enjoy a variety of ryes (KC cask, EHT, and PIkesville are on my regular rotation).  I like this one, but not enough to buy it again. It's tasty, but there's too much competition at this price point from bottled-in-bond expressions and any number of similarly MGP-sourced branded bottles."
