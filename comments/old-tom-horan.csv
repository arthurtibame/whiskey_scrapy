3.75,Decent whiskey at a low price
3.75,Almost dangerously smooth.  Not much of a taste profile
3.75,"Your standard Irish with more flavor and a more complex finish vs Jameson. For $20, I’m buying it all day long for straight and mixing."

3.5,"Every bit as good as Jameson, Bushmills, etc. for less money.  Standard Irish biscuit and vanilla flavors with some fruityness to it as well.   Does not have the slight burn on the finish that Jameson has."

3.5,"First off this is not a top shelf bottle. But for what it is, it is good. Apricot vanilla and sour cream frosting come out on the nose and the palette with a hit of toast. With a little air and water more fruit and vanilla are present. This is a good gift or party bottle if you want to introduce people to Irish whiskey."
