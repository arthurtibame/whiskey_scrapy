4.0,"Taste: a sweet alternative to the traditional Islay.  If you read the label it literally says "" fresh styled, lighter bodied"" Islay.  Couldn't agree more.  For Sherry lovers looking to explore peat, I would recommend this scotch.

Nose: inviting light smoke with Carmel notes.

Color: light gold

Finish: 7, very inviting Islay.

Score: 7 on a 1-10. Above avg"

3.75,"The first taste is smoky, peaty and seaweedy.  It does have hit of citrus and toffee, but these are background notes.

The aftertaste is long, warm, peppery and smoky.  It lingers pleasantly for a long while.

This is a very well balanced whisky.  I would consider it an ‘entry level’ Islay malt as it doesn’t stretch too much into some of the wilder, stronger tastes the island is famous for, but it’s still very obviously an Islay."

2.5,"Nose: educational, as in it reminds me of something associated with a classroom, but I can’t figure it out; maybe an old time dry erase marker
Taste: leather, hint of apple, hint of ginger maybe, that fades to smoke.
Finish: nice, long drawn out smoke

Nothing great here, average. Like the smoke though."

3.25,"Maritime smoke with un-defined sweetness.  Sips afterwards reveal cured meat with overlays of fruity, honeyed characters.  The finish is maritime sea salt, with a decent amount of brininess.  A tad too briny for me.  I will gladly drink this any day, but I don't think I will buy a bottle.

4.25,"On the nose A peat filled smoke hits you up front. It’s moss and twig aroma is as if to have been soaked in salt water. There’s light fruit on the aroma as well but the brine makes it difficult to label specifically. On the palate, it’s oily in texture, smooth and fresh. Tastes of honey and apple, sea salt and spice. Delightfully long finish that builds as it lingers. Damn! This stuff is good."

4.5,"Great expression from caol ila. Something I can drink on a daily. The nose is rich, lightly sweet and overwhelming smoke. Palate is on the lighter side, a balanced peat with vanilla notes. The finish is long, oily and peaty."
4.0,"Light peat, medium smoke and nice balance of fruit and floral"
4.5,"Wow. Amazing dram. I think i have met the most smooth islay whisky out there. 

Bottled at 43% abv with an amber color.

On the nose it is fantastic. Main notes are:
Peat
Peat
Peat
Peat 
Caramel
Sea weed
Fish
Salt
Oil
Olives
Prunes...... and peat.

On the palate it is delicious, smooth and balanced. Starts so gentle, not harsh at all. 
Oakyness and spicy is so balanced and beautiful. So sweet it can be considered a dessert. Some almonds can be found. Phenolic in the nose and in the mouth. Just perfect. Olives. Short tobacco aftertaste.

Overall it is a 92 over 100, it lost 8 points because the finish is very short but it is a spectacular dram. Cheers!"

4.0,Sipping salami
4.5,"A 200 ml bottle in a three-pack. The nose is fusel alcohol, blacktop tar, charcoal and leather furniture. The peat is definitely a factor, with just a wisp of salty Butterscotch. Definitely a medicinal/band-aid soft plastic component. A hint of dark berry. Flowery perfume second wave in the nose. The aroma of this is crazy complex.

The taste is earthy peat, like a black soil mouthwash. In the way down the gullet you get hot coals and campfire soot. A black peppery character hits the sides of the tongue, followed by more charcoal ashes. There is definitely an element of ""babysick"" as the Scottish call it.

There is some softer, sweeter secondary notes:  butterscotch, caramel, a touch of plum. 

The finish is ashes: charcoal briquettes, campfire residue. There is a puckery, tannic element if you sit with it for long enough. Caol Ila is an absolute joy to drink."

2.0,Pungent flavor probably from oil skins?
3.5,"Smoky rubber, almost cough syrupy smell at first that subtly changes into a deep, sweet, and rich smell that envelops your nose with a fiery peat aroma. 

First taste, the oils are very apparent and glide smoothly over the palate. It tastes sharply of wood and peat and almost singes and numbs the tongue. The most prevalent taste becomes medicinal and industrial as the burn wears off, and you are left with a satisfying aftertaste that is oddly simultaneously sweet and dry."
3.75,"Nose: iodine at first, then sweetish orange notes appear
Palate: peaty, hint of iodine, dark chocolate, light courvoisier taste
Finish: surprisingly gentle warm aftertaste, some dry-ness"
3.75,The nose is definitely Smoke forward with some sweet fresh herb notes. The legs of the whiskey in the glass are also very oily and stick to the walls. The taste is smoky but not overwhelming with hints of almost basil type herbs and finishes spicy and medium in length.

5.0,"GLASS: 
Dalmore Glencairn Copita Nosing Glass

NOSE: 
Well balanced notes of mineral/rust, iodine, smoke, grassy/wheat, vanilla and a hint of mint

PALATE:
Starts with seaside brine then a quick transition into toasted malt. The middle is pepper and spice, followed by a finish of nuts, cereal with baking spices. 

CONCLUSION: 
My favorite Scotch. Mother's milk. So satisfying. Islay without extremes."

5.0,Love it! One of my favorite drams.
4.5,“Undefined & unaerthy” smokiness
3.5,"The nose has a tart, peaty seaweed quality. It smells kind of herbal and bitter but fairly rich. It smells a bit like a more tart, less grainy, less chocolate-malty Laphroaig 10. The palate is similar to the nose. There's a lot of salt with bitter-tart seaweed and tobacco from the peat. There's some malty character and a bit of nectar floral sweetness and vanilla the makes it seem a bit Irish, but it's definitely strongly an Islay whiskey. I appreciate it well enough and am decently happy to sip it, but it doesn't have anything really exciting going on. Laphroaig 10 is more chaotic with dark chocolate and campfire notes mixed more cereal this a more restrained with a restrained bit of spice adding harshness. There's kind of more of an oiliness to it too. The flavors mostly go together, but I'm not a big fan of the result. There's some fruity sweetness, but it's not too strong and it's nothing exquisite. The flavor profile does gradually grow on me though, so I'd be happy to sip this. It seems hard to be more quintessentially an Islay malt, but in achieving that feat, the result lacks its own interesting character. It's a bit better than Laphroaig 10, but for the money it doesn't seem worth it."

4.25,"Color: Pale yellow (similar to Ardbeg 10), very long legs on the twirl - oily

Nose: Band aids, Peat, Lysol, Lemon Citrus, Seaside Brine
- After accidentally getting some in my nose it smells a lot sweeter than at first!

Taste: Initial burst of sweetness with a watery mouth feel that gives way to layers of Peat, Grass, Sea Air, and sweet Lemon. 

Finish: A hint of earthy nuts lingers (similar to Lagavulin 16) after an initial burst of Menthol/Mint.

Overall: I was pleasantly surprised by this whisky. The initial sweetness and nutty aftertaste combine elements of Oban and Lagavulin. This Islay isn’t a pour for everyone, but it’s one that I’ll come back to often.

4.25,Soft peat and brine on the nose.  Slight chloraseptic taste on the front end. Easy finish that has the Islay brine and a hint of mint feel on the back of the throat.  The perfect everyday sipping Islay.

5.0,"This is on the peatier side of my base line Scotch which was Macallan 12 when it was still being made. This is my favorite Scotch in the world that I can occasionally afford. It tastes like Scotland to me. Scotland is a little bit bigger and bolder in attitude about everything and this Scotch is smooth, but with complexity and bit bolder on the peaty side than the average quality Scotch. It is VERY complex not just peaty. There are definitely more peaty and iodine flavored Scotches. Caol Ila did it perfect!"
