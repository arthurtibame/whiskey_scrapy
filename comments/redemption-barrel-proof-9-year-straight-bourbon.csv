4.0,"First time I had a whiskey by redemption and I throughly enjoyed it, decent amount of sweetness but also a nice burn, I would like to taste more of their line after this"
3.25,"Nose - (w/o water) Sweet hot heat, lightly oaky vanilla caramels, hints of leather (w/ water) Less heat, addition of faint cherry & oaky strawberry hard candy.

Taste - (w/o water) Hot, drying heat, sweet vanilla caramels, cinnamon heat, light oak (w/ water) Still drying, light addition of cherry to vanilla caramel sweet, cinnamon heat, still drying

Finish - (w/o water) Hot mouth drying cinnamon tingle, vanilla caramels, light oak (w/ water) Still mouth drying, light oak, dry vanilla caramels

Score - 72/100

Final Thoughts - So sadly this didn't really offer much other than a hot ""standard"" bourbon experience at higher proof. Luckily it wasn't as mouth drying as the barrel proof rye, but it was still there. This was just a high abv ""standard"" bourbon that didn't really offer much in terms of complexity other than hot heat.

Would I drink it if offered? - Maybe

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"
