5.0,"Starts with strong ash and a touch a brine that takes me to nighttime on the beach, as the bonfire smolders and fades away. The longer it sits the more fresh fruity sweetness appears, like overripe plum, which fades into toasted vanilla marshmallow on the palate. The ashiness lingers with stewed dark fruit for a long and complex finish that is keeping me salivating long after the last sip. I can't keep my nose out of this thing. A true revelation, and certainly the best single malt I've had."
