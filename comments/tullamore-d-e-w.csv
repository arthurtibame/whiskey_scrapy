2.0,"On the nose it has a very sour aroma, like under ripe, acidic, green apples and grapefruit pith, with an earthy, unwashed orchard fruit peel note that feels a stark contrast to the underlying strong vanilla aroma.
-
To the palate it is soft with a light fruit flavour, then an alcoholic sting where the sour citrus notes start to appear leading towards a damp wood flavour that has a coating of white sugar and vanilla extract.
-
The finish is short, but sour with that lingering green apple flavour accented by some mild wood spice and maybe an unsalted butter flavour.

3.75,"Nose: honey, butterscotch, bread, spices, light fruits, malted barley, hints of oak

Palate: rich and sweet with more pear, honey, vanilla, apple, some additional spice on the backend 

Finish: barley comes out more at the end and this trends toward scotch territory generally

I recommend bourbon drinkers try Teeling Single Grain if they want to branch out into Irish, but this is another excellent choice. It’s rich for a 80-proofer, and has enough spice and familiar flavors, but diverts into Irish whiskey territory with ease. I like
to call this the Buffalo Trace of Irish whiskey."

1.75,"Very simple and not really smooth what contadicts the statement on the label. 
Vanilla, spices and some citrus to the nose. And way too spiritous. 
Same to the tongue - vanilla, creamy caramel, some grain and not the faintest sniff of malt.
Finish is not remarkable at all. One feels spirit and sweetness on the tongue, but without any special nuances.
Definitely not a one to have at home, even for a daily drink."

3.0,"This is my own personal ‘house whisky’, the workhorse of my home bar. Typical of basic blended Irish, it’s clean with a butter biscuity, malty character and a bit of bright fruit. This stuff does it all: cheap and easy drinking enough for shots or mixing but with enough character to drink neat or on the rocks—my preference. I like it enough to have tried many of the other more advanced variants and I quickly got my hands on the Tullamore stone crock, proudly displayed on my bar. I haven’t let it run dry since buying it, and it’s been refilled or spiked with every other DEW variant I’ve tried. My own all-Tully solera blend."

It’s much better than Jameson because it’s not as sweet, but it’s still relatively bland. I don’t think I would mind having a bottle on hand, but then again, it would be forced out by much higher quality spirits in my cabinet."

The palate is quite good though; smooth, with notes of sweet honey and dry wood. On the finish the grain is again very noticable with a slight (cheap) vodka-like bitterness. But all-in-all it’s an ok whiskey, that is not only good for mixing (though I would prefer to add a few bucks to get a good but still cheap single malt such as Old Pulteney 10, Glenfiddich 10 or Glenmorangie 10)."

3.75,"There comes a time when you don't want to dig too deeply in the pocket, but you need something with a robust character. Jameson is for the popped collar frat boys who watched too many Irish gangster movies. Tullamore green label is the hammer in your toolbox. It might not be elegant, but with the right vigor, it can tear down a house, trash a window, reduce a toilet to rubble, or hang an original oil painting. 

It's rich, slightly rowdy, and well rounded. Character, value, and depth. I found this with a $5 rebate, and for that price they're basically demanding I drink the entire bottle in a weekend. Start with an irish coffee -- a dollop of heavy cream, a shot of Tullamore, and some nice black coffee. Wait a few hours, have a cup of tea, then spend the afternoon drinking this on the rocks. Evening will come, but you might not be there to enjoy it."

If this was your introduction to Tullamore DEW, then you have entered into a very rare and unfortunate fraternity/sorority. Albeit delicious and a perfect compliment to a stimulant, your night most likely went downhill from there and/or escalated quickly. 

One doesn’t simply stop by the BV for a nightcap; no no, there is a pirate ship in walking distance that’ll most likely inspire your inner privateer.

On the palate is a little less appealing and more straight forward, but very very smooth. Pepper, oak, new freshly cut wood, with a light body but a long spicy finish very pleasant.

2.5,"My scale is a 2.5 = fully mainstream.  A solid, if unremarkable, whiskey.  That is an apt description of this. 

I've been drinking Tullamore for more years than I care to disclose. Sweet, innocuous, with flavors of honey & grain &  alcohol. 

It's not going to change your world, but it might brighten your afternoon!

3.0,"Nose: Creme brûlée, vanilla extract, oak, marzipan, pepper, toast, green apple, pear. Bourbon notes.

Taste: vanilla, pepper, bitter almond, and oak.

Preferable to Jameson and usually a few dollars cheaper."

2.75,"Solid irish whiskey good pairing with the annual corned beef. I used to drink this a lot more before falling into the dark hole of bourbon. It’s a nice drink that’s light and goes down smooth. Happy St. Pats Day!

3.25,"Floral smell, slight peppermint, nutty, bland, smooth"
4.25,"Nose: Sweet and fruity. Honey is the strongest aroma. Some toffee notes as well.

Palate: A little malty. Honey is just as strong here too making it sweet but not overpowering. Fruitiness as well comes and goes.

Finish: Medium-long. Dried fruit lingers with a little vanilla and honey.

Overall Thoughts: For its price, this is a great whiskey. I’ve always preferred Jameson as my go to budget whiskey but I’ll have to keep a bottle of Tullamore safely stocked as well. Easily sipped and would be nice to have a glass or two before bed."
