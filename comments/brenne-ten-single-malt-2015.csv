3.0,sweet and full. lots of orange and vanilla. not as bright and melon-y as the younger Brenne. a big jump up.

2.0,"This is an older version of the regular Brenne. I still find way too much banana for my liking, though it is more palatable to me overall."

2.0,"I have the 2015 release.  I enjoyed the fruity ex-Cognac of the standard Brenne, but this has a light, caramel-y flavor that reminds me of single grain whiskies and I'm not a fan."
3.75,"First experience with Cognac barrel whisky. Enjoyed both bottles. Cherries, honey, bubble gum."

4.5,Less sweet than the NAS In a good way.
4.0,"Had it at WhiskyLive NJ. Less floral than her ( Alison Patel) original, which I felt was more a perfume than whiskey.  This has less floral, a bit more wood, and much more depth.  Interesting find."
4.0,Bananas. Very unique.
null,not a fan. hints of licorice

3.0,"Not the most complex whisky, especially on the nose, but it is tasty.  It needs a few drops of water to open it up.  Nice balance of well-rounded stone-fruit with the skins and oak tannins.  Has a sharp spice which fades very quickly.  The longer you let it sit on your tongue, the creamier and sweeter is gets."
3.0,"[Whiskey Live NY 2018] - Good stuff, but somehow found much less to write home about than the NAS.  Also, this shizz is super expensive for almost no reason other than they can charge for it D:"

null,"Tried this at the whisky extravaganza. Tastes very similar to the estate cask with notes of vanilla, bananas, bubble gum, and floral notes, but tastes more like whisky than its younger counterpart."
