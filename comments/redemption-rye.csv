4.0,"It was on sale at a significant discount, so I picked it up, having never tasted it. Was my gamble worth it? 
YES.  On the nose, it smells toasty, almost fruity, a bit woody, and the distinct rye spiciness comes through. On the palate, much sweeter than expected. A mildly bitter finish. The spiciness of the rye really shines, thanks in part to the 46% abv. Not something I'd consider putting on ice, as I think the higher-than-average abv is this spirit's saving grace. It really gives it some character.
As someone who is only just discovering ryes as a viable competition to bourbon and scotch, I'll admit, this one hits the mark. I like it. I'd probably buy another bottle."

On the palate, there’s more spice and some barrel char, as well as a bit of heat - a bit hotter than expected for its ABV. 

The finish is fairly long and spicy, with some vanilla as I breathe out through my nose.  

The palate is t up there with my favorite ryes like Knob Creek, Rittenhouse, and Crown Northern Harvest, but it gains some points back on finish.  Side note: benefits from ice.  3 stars."

2.5,"Redemption Rye is yet another bottling of the 95% rye mash bill whiskey from MGP. Same as Bulliet, Dickel, and Templeton. And a few others I imagine that I don’t know yet. But while Bulliet and Dickel are solid ryes for the price point, Redemption leaves something to be desired. 

This whiskey is bottled at 46% ABV and is aged “not less than one year” in new charred oak barrels. Some write ups (including Distiller) have mentioned aging up to two and-a-half years. However, nowhere on the label does it claim to be “straight rye whiskey”, so I have my doubts. It may be a blend of barrels less than two years with a bit of slightly older stuff but in any case, this is a young whiskey and it shows. 

In the glass it’s a medium gold color, the first indication of its young age. Swirling leaves an oily coating but just a few slow legs. The nose is young grain whiskey, mild rye spice, a slight burn, and little else. There is a hint of fruitiness if you are patient enough to let it set a few. 

The palate is dry, minty, spicy oak. Little to no sweetness. The finish was actually unpleasant to me: just astringent, bitter oak tannins and an alcohol bite. This is not a good whiskey to sip neat. It does make a decent Manhattan; it’s dry, spicy character works well with the vermouth. This bottle was $24 locally. Not expensive, but considering the aforementioned Bulliet and Dickel can be had for the same or less, I will not bother with another one of these. 2.5/5. Cheers!"

3.75,"My first foray into an MGP 95/5 rye. 

Nose has some interesting elements; some floral notes (lilies maybe?), and remember those orange slice jelly candies with the sugar on them? Lots of that. Light toffee note underneath.

Palate opens with some brown sugar and nutmeg, but quickly switches to mint/eucalyptus mid way through. The finish is where this really excels. It’s a blend of nearly every kind of spice you can think of; black pepper, chilies, candied ginger, clove, spicy wood/barrel notes, and mustard seed. The only type of heat not in the finish is ethanol, which is gloriously absent. That spicy finish lingers for quite some time. Mouthfeel is nothing special, but does not detract. 

I would be remiss if I didn’t make mention of the fact that I have read other reviews on this whiskey and the results have been...not good. Lots of complaints of plastic and other off flavors, of which I got none. I don’t know what some of these reviewers tasted; it’s almost like they are drinking a completely different whiskey. Maybe I just got a good batch. Criminally underrated. Is it top notch? No. But is it solid for $27? Hell yes. Looking forward to trying more 95% ryes."

3.0,"Appearance: A polished copper color is what I view in this MGP rye. Thick watery legs dribble their way down the glass.

Nose: The nose is both sweet and savory with notes of oatmeal raisin cookies, cinnamon, honey, caramel, vanilla, light smoke, like the smell of residual smoke left on your jacket after a campfire, some eucalyptus, and toast. 

Taste: The palate was surprisingly pleasant and had notes of rye bread spiciness, dark chocolate, fennel/black licorice, and cinnamon.

Finish: There was a spicy then eventually mellow, lingering clove finish that was quite nice.

Thoughts: The Redemption brand is not what I would call a top shelfer, but it’s still  good. I prefer the rye to the bourbon personally, as I perceived more complexity and flavors than the bourbon. I don’t mind it one bit, and would recommend it if you haven’t tried it and are getting into ryes. Thanks, MGP. Cheers!"
4.0,"***Be Careful there are 1 Yr old bottles of this on the shelves!***
My first bottle turned out to be aged stated on the back 1 Yr and wasn't good; it had a lot of young sharp heat.
When I finally found another one that said aged 2 Yrs on the back label I decided to give it a second chance. I am glad to say the 2+ yr is much better and I am enjoying it. I am guessing they use wood staves to give this 95% MGP a lot of woodiness and set it apart from all the others. I taste good peach woodiness and nice amount of sweetness. It has a little extra heat, but I still enjoy sipping it neat. I may like this better than Bulliet. Redemption (and MGP of course) did a good job on this 2 Yr Rye - But make sure it is age stated 2 Yrs!"
2.5,"It's fine and all, but doubt I would get a 2nd bottle - probably better options out there. Not bad, but nothing special about it that I can place.  This is my 2nd tasting, after first opening it a couple months ago. I recall a more viscous, sweeter mouthfeel at that time. Maybe i'm just losing my mind?  Anyway, the next rye I get will be something different, and I'll probably still have some of this left to compare it against. No complaints considering the $$."
4.0,Great whistle clean cheap sipper. Solid cocktail base too

2.5,"Oaky, not my favorite"
3.75,Smooth for a high rye
null,"How anyone rated this whiskey over 50 points is completely beyond me. It tastes like sour milk, and goat vaginas. I tried it straight, and on the rocks...AWFUL. I mixed it with everything that I drink whiskey with...AWFUL. I feel bad saying this, because their bourbon is pretty good, and their wheated bourbon is one of my favorites. Don't waste your money on the rye."

3.5,Solid in an old fashioned or Manhattan.
3.0,Not terrible; maybe a little less refined than Bulleit. Strong alcohol presence up front with the usual notes of rye spice following behind.

3.0,"Nose- light caramel toffee notes, orange zest, 

Taste- short sweet front end with a long spicy finish."
4.0,"Aromas of oak, spice and orange. A touch of nail polish remover but not terribly unpleasant. Flavors are plenty of spice, oaky and caramel. Medium body, really coats the tongue in a slightly sticky way, pleasant warming burn that lingers and tingles the tongue. Great for the price, enjoyed neat, also perfect for cocktails, preferably Manhattans."

3.5,A bit of bite but clean finish. Best on rocks.  Grassy finish.
3.0,Light on the nose. Barely any noticeable smell. Very gentle after the initial burn.
