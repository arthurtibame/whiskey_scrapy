5.0,"*drank out of a rocks glass

Nose: Even out of a rocks glass the nose the nose was amazing. I could just spend all day nosing it. lightly sweet caramel, brown sugar, vanilla. no alcohol/ethanol

palate: spicy like a stick of big red gum but more cinnamon forward. despite the spicy wood flavor it doesn't bite and drinks very smooth."
