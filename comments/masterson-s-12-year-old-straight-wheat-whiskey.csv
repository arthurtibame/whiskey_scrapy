2.0,"Oh my! What a peculiar smell, whiskey with b8tter almonds, I don't know. I thought it was some k8nd of bourbon and by the sweetness probably not far away. I think it is the unrefined vanilla/scotch I took as bitter almond. So now I need to find a cocktail with both bourbon and maraschino."

1.0,"Too sweet without really anything much else there. It has some fresh cut oak on the back end, but it's just a sugar bomb, think unflavored cotton candy or raw, unrefined sugar, from sip to swallow. I like sweet whiskies, but this one is a dud."
null,"Smells syrupy. Some floral notes. Sweet on the tongue, some dark chocolate, honey at the end. Smooth for the proof. Somewhat straightforward. 7/30/17"
