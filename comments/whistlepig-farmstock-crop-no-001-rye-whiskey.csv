4.0,High notes of vanilla and very sweet. Not as good as the 10yr or 12 but definitely one of my favorites.
3.0,"This is a decent rye, has some spice—but not worth the price.  I have a dozen ryes in the cabinet that outshine this bottle, all of which were half the cost.  

If you need a bottle of Whistlepig in your cabinet, shop up market and get the Old World Cask (or Boss Hog)."
4.0,Peppercorn on the nose.  Light and round body.
4.0,really 4.5.  not sure which crop. but its a toss up between this and the ten year

4.0,"Most definitely lighter and less spicy than it’s 12yr Rye cousin, this is an admirable expression. For the price point, I would have hoped for more ‘Farmstock’ and less MGP, but in the end the dram did not disappoint"

3.0,"2.5 stars

Better than the 10 year, but still nothing special and at to high a price point."
1.0,"I really enjoyed the WP 10yr and 12yr Old world cask.  I expected a similar quality from the farmstock but was sorely disappointed.  Tasted extremely young, and I can name 10 ryes under $40 that are better.

Literally my worst whiskey purchase of the year."

4.0,Classsic pig and actually quite good considering the young blend. Excited to try the fully matured version of the Vermont grain bottle.

3.0,Don’t agree with Winos... 3 stars is as high as I can go for the price. Stereo typical overly expensive Canadian whiskey. Nothing special other than it’s a rye base with additives versus a normal Canadian whiskey with additives. Not bad... just not great. Change my mind.

3.75,"Nose - vanilla, a little caramel, spicy, medium alocohol, smells sweet, but not too much. 
Palate - clean burn, definitely taste the rye spiciness deep flavor, no fall slices 
Finish - a little medicinal, smooth, medicinal lingering feel to the mouth 

Definitely better as you drink it"
