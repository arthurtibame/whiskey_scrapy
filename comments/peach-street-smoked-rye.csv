0.5,"Honey gold was the misleadingly sweet color in this, for lack of a better word, “whiskey.” And thin semi-viscous legs clung to then dribbled their way back down again.

As far as the nose went, right off the bat you knew something was different. The main focus as I inhaled was intense oily smoke and polyurethane fumes. It’s like doing a house demo then burning all the trash instead of throwing it in a dumpster. There was something sweet hiding there, but needless to say, like a peasant in a Monty Python skit, it was being suppressed.

The palate, if you can believe it, was worse than the smell! There was an oily mouthfeel and taste, and the only detectable notes I could pick up on was what I imagine wood varnish tasting like, a bitter cloying element, and an acidity that triggered my gag reflex. I literally shuttered when I drank this.

The finish was harsh and too long as it was hard to sit through without afterwards taking a sip of water.

Wow. I had no idea there would be a whiskey out there I would dislike as much as this. I literally could not finish one glass. I tried, multiple times on different days thinking different factors would cause me to look on it more favorably, but alas, no. Now, the only way I could recommend this whiskey would be as a joke, or a gift to someone you dislike. Otherwise, stay away! Peach Street, I really am not sure what you were going for, but I am really hoping your other products are better than this. Anyways, (with a new whiskey in glass) Cheers!"
