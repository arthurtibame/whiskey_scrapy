3.0,Very unique. You can taste the cinnamon strongly and then the vanilla tobacco and clove. Nice
3.25,"Ranger Creek 44 Rye
Batch 26; Bottle 463; Spring 2018 
17 months age; 94 proof; 100% rye
This one is so fun and unique. If I could boil this down to a simple description; all you horse and cattle folks...the smell of sweet feed grain, get that in your head. This tastes like what you would imagine from the smell. Like someone distilled sweet feed into a whiskey. Sweet molasses and grain. 

Nose: rich butterscotch, hay, green grains, wildflower honey with lemon, black tea leaves, tea olive blossoms, fennel

Palate: honey and butterscotch explode into peppery spice, fresh hay and green rye on the mid, herbal mint, then the secondary explosion of rye spice fills the whole mouth. 
Finish: Leather, sour honey, cracked pepper, bread crust. 

Definitely a young spirit but a fun and funky exploration. Not your typical rye, much more unique with that big Texas heat and oak influence."

3.0,Tastes somewhat hollow. The rye is there but it's not up in your face at all
