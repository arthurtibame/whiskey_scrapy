4.5,"I loved the one drink I had of the discontinued Longmorn 15, so was looking forward to trying this one at a recent evening of Adelphi tastings. It turned out to be the highlight of the event. The nose is icing sugar, the palate hazelnut ice-cream with a spicy finish. Pricey at around $225 but tempting."
