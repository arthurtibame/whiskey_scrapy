3.0,"An interesting and vibrant pour.  Notably ""different"" from most bourbons I've tried.  Strong nose and flavor of both mint and cherries.  No ethanol on the nose, just pure cherry.  Moderately spicy with nutmeg and a splash of iodine.  Definitely woody but not a traditional oak profile.  Will enjoy the bottle, need to try a few side by side to decide if ""different"" means ""better""."

Cherry syrup and citrus peel on the nose.  A hint of unripened pear.

Cinnamon and cherries dominate the palate.  Thin body.  A gentle spice lingers on the finish.  Hints of nutmeg and allspice.  A bit astringent like a less sweet mulled cider or wine.

Uniquely flavored for a bourbon.  Don’t love it, don’t hate it."

4.0,"I was over at a friend’s (incidentally, one who doesn’t really drink whiskey) and he offered me some Rowan’s Creek. I never had much interest in Rowan’s Creek, as I’m not a fan of Willet Pot Still Reserve and Rowan’s Creek is another of Willet’s offerings. Still, free whiskey is free whiskey, and I’m always game to try something new.

Age: NAS (formerly 12 years)

Mashbill: Unknown

Abv: 50.05%

Price: N/A, but $36.99 at Total Wine in Houston, Texas

Setting: Neat in a shot glass (sub-optimal but at least good for nosing)

Nose: Maple syrup, banana, and red hots.

Taste: Peanut, oak, cherry, and cinnamon. The proof provides a nice viscosity to the mouthfeel.

Finish: Medium duration. Lingering cinnamon and oak. Pleasing heat.

Conclusion: This was surprisingly good. The respectable proof and combination of sweet and cinnamon flavors provide an overall nice experience. I also find it somewhat interesting that it carries both cherry and peanut flavors, which are typically different flavor profiles. It’s on the pricier side for a bourbon, but I may have to pick up a bottle, as I really enjoyed this.

Rich red color.  Thin.  Hints of cherry sweetness on the nose, but flat.  Buttery.  Earthy grains.  Bittersweet.  Mr. Pibb mixed with oatmeal.  Aspartame.  Spiced cherry tempered by a flat, dusty hay bale.  A touch of mint and allspice.  Lingering minty spice in the cheeks on the finish."

3.75,"I started this on the previous Saturday afternoon in the Catskills.  A no agenda day continuing with a bourbon weekend. Foo Fighters in the background. Just laughs, food, drink and fun.  But either I needed to concentrate more as I couldn’t discern or identify the aromas and flavors accurately or a week of oxidation was needed to draw or strengthen the characteristics of the bourbon. 

Bottle-Batch 18-32 which is a reddish amber. Similar in color to birch beer. 

The initial alcohol fumes are quite potent and need time to dissipate.  Oaken brown sugar sweetness, charred marshmallows, Karo corn syrup and leather.  There is a sweetness of vanilla cream with maraschino cherries and cola. A cinnamon and rye spiciness counters the sweetness.  All of these collective aromas are somewhat subdued and light. 

On a medium light body comes, initially, a soft vanilla sweetness that fades into a peppery, tingly cinnamon and wood spice. Butterscotch, oak, cola, sweetness all fairly sweetly balanced.

A bit of water softens the nose and, obviously, dilutes the bourbon.  Water, strips some character. 

The finish is medium long and dry.  Tangerine or orange bitters with charred oak and all warms the soul. 

I was expecting more on the initial tasting.  More richness, more depth, more flavors.  Nicely backed by 50% ABV but sips like it’s 43%. However, a good dose of aeration and time improves the dram as this is what it needs to broaden and concentrate and define itself. A quality nose which lacks a broader palate.  A decent bourbon overall. It’s brethren, Noah’s Mill, is what this aspires to be. This is a good everyday sipper at an affordable price. [$38][87/100][Tasted: 2/17/19; 2/22/19]"

null,One the best bottles for the money.
3.0,"Spices (from the rye) and maple hit me instantly on the nose, and then some orange.

Ultimately, the spice and orange go back and forth throughout the drink. Sometimes I get peanut butter with the rye spice, and that shows up a few times throughout the drink. I guess I'm not acclimated to rye-heavy drinks just yet, or maybe they'll never grow on me.

All in all, it's a very nice bourbon and fairly complex, even if it's not my preference. I paid $35 for it, which was a tad too high. If I could get it in the $20s, then I'd gladly have it in my rotation."

4.0,"Taste:  Neat in glen cairn

Nose: (3.5)  Nose is light, I wanted more.  First thing that hit me was vanilla custard and cherries.  Very pleasing but I wanted more of it.  Really had to dig deep.  This is more like a refined light nose instead of jumping out of the glass.  Did pique my curiosity.

Palate (4.0):  The vanilla custard is there and the cherries go to the background.  The palate is much spicier than the nose.  A hit of white pepper and mandarin oranges jump out at you then dissipates quickly.  Made me go, hmmm pleasant surprise.  Mouthfeel coats well and a bit oily.  All and all I like it.

Finish: (4.5)  Man that's smooth.  Medium and lingers like orange-cream soda.  

Overall:  I won this one on a bet with a buddy and it was his pick for me.  It is a creamy vanilla, cherry, and orange example of how bourbons can be different from traditional but be very good.  My biggest complaint was that the nose was a little timid.  I loved the vanilla custard but I had to really search.  From my understanding Noah's Mill is this same bourbon but at at higher proof.  Definately makes me want to try that.  This is a definate behind the bar pick and I am glad I won my bet!"
4.0,"Rowan's Creek

Nose... Picking up refined herbal notes, followed by coffee, anise and apricot. 

Appearance... A light mahogany with slow running legs...

Taste... Initially it's all herbal and earthy with notes of leather, then it's a straight b-line to the baked goods aisle with chocolate chip cookies stepping up and and oaty cereal poking it's head out....

Overall... Another KEEPER, HUGE HUGE HUGE... I'll be keeping this in my home stash as long as the price stays steady. It's full of nuance, a great dessert drink which would pair tremendously with a rich brownie topped with powdered sugar.. This is a dessert whiskey in my humble opinion... Solid!!!"

4.25,"Initial impression is that this is a nuttier bourbon than I typically care for, but I think it’s well done for those of us who like that kind of thing. To me, it also tastes like a higher ABV than it really is, which is once again something I typically don’t care for. End of disclaimers.

Nose is not as astringent as I was expecting, given the body. It’s more true to 100 proof. I get sugar-crusted walnuts. I actually really dig that smell.

Body delivers on that nutty flavor. Reminds me of Willett, with some dark chocolate in there too.

Finish trails off with powdered sugar and cinnamon.

I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed this drink. It’s very well done. For my money, this belongs in the conversation with Blanton’s Gold for a solid 100ish proof nutty bourbon. Unlike Blanton’s Gold, we Americans are worthy enough to buy this little guy on primary. And I think we all should. 

(Begin side-bar) 

Dear Ancient Age International:

I get it. We Americans were stupid and thought that bourbon was bad for a bit. We’ve learned from our mistakes. Mostly. Don’t pay attention to the south on Sundays. Point is... we’re ready to feel the warm embrace of our Japanese overlords who thankfully helped prevent us from destroying much of our only native alcohol style. So... we cool brah?

4.0,"Right after the pour a strong nose of cherries, vanilla, raisin, oak, and while some reviewers get orange, I got white grape.  Definitely fruit forward. After it's been sitting a while, some buttered popcorn notes appear.

Cherries and a date/fig flavor up front.  Mid-palate features some peanut, rock candy, and smoky barrel char. Bold and punchy.

Finishes spicy with cinnamon and clove. Remnants of oak after everything else fades. Medium length. Definitely has a sharp bite and brings an enjoyable slow burn especially for a 100 proof'er; drinks a little hotter than expected but that's not a negative with the flavor profile. 

Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Very oily; coats your entire mouth. 

This one hit my palate just right; cherries, peanut and oak are always going to be winning combo in my book. While it lacks a little refinement, it makes up for it in flavor pop.  At a $42 price tag it is a decent value; the only thing questionable is that you can score it's slightly superior big brother Noah's Mill for about $7 more so I would probably just go with that. But if Noah's isn’t available and/or if this was marked down a little? Oh yeah, re-buy all day."

3.75,More spicy than most bourbons. Interesting flavor profile but not very complex. An easy drinking everyday sipper if you're looking for something slightly different than the typical bourbon flavor profile.

3.25,"Well this used to have an age statement edition which no longer exists. NAS is becoming more prevalent as we all sadly know. This review then is for the current version. Poured neat, cinnamon spice , caramel, wood and alcohol fumes. Noses hotter than the 100.1 proof. Does settle a bit as it sits. Palate continues the heat with charred cinnamon and wood with a funky malty note that I believe BDanner has brought up before. Its much better than the Pure Kentucky XO I had as the cinnamon is held in check. Adding water really opens it up and is a marked improvement. This spicy, malty, charred funky flavor seems(to me) to be the Willet signature. Its very different from other distillers and is growing on me. Finish is long with the spicy cinnamon, char and malty notes along with wood barrel that is less dry than most. Overall its pretty hot for proof but brings unique flavors in fairly good balance. I think this will be a like it or hate it proposition for most. Im getting used to it now and actually believe the Clyde May Straight Bourbon is sourced here. For me this bourbon hits its sweet spot at lower proof so I will most likely pass on the Noah's Mill Ive been considering and just get the Clyde May as Im 90% sure its from Willet. As far as Rowan's Creek its a solid choice if you enjoy the profile........83/100....good spicy flavorful bourbon with a different take than the usual vanilla/caramel entries"

3.75,Cherry dominates the nose with orange blossom citrus and vanilla. On the palate the cherry is much softer with some red delicious apple and plenty of nutmeg and baking spices. Oak tannins give a little too much grip but help to showcase the corn sweetness. A long finish with supple structure leaves me wanting more.
