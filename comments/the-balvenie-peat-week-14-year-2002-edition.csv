4.0,"Thanks to Dreaming of Islay for this sample. This one was a surprise. I wasn't sure how the peat of Balvenie was going to be, but the nose gave off some floral peat, mixed with heavily iced cookies with a touch of gingerbread. More of that on the palate with more presence of peat. This is not an Islay, but it came and made a statement. The finish was short but satisfying. Only needed a very small drop of water since it's near that 48% ABV sweet spot. Thankfully, it was not extremely woody. The song for this one is ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"" - the GnR version."
4.0,"Just had a quick dram of this in the company of none other than master distiller David Stewart, who happened to be signing bottles in a store near my office. It's quite different to the Peated Triple Cask I reviewed earlier, but just as well balanced and integrated. The main difference is that the peat is more overt on this one, which is matured entirely in new and refill American oak. The triple cask has some sherry wood in the mix, which Stewart said has the effect of subduing the peat influence a touch. I had to search to find the typical Balvenie notes of honey, but they are present in the finish. Don't expect Islay-level peatiness -- this is tamer mainland smoke. There's just enough to influence the nose and initial taste without overwhelming the spirit. Worth buying a bottle."
4.0,"Actually, the coolest thing about this bottle might be the bottle itself, and the tin.  I couldn't even summarize all of the material here, but there is some fascinating insight into The Balvenie's process.  The side of the tin even includes a graphic of the organic composition of the peat in the Scottish Highlands compared to Islay, which accounts for some of the difference in flavor.  According to the graphic, almost 50% of Islay peat consists of phenol, which produces a medicinal character, while the Highlands feature a much larger share of non-phenolic, earthy, peat.  The two have roughly equal shares of ""guaiacol"" peat, which produces sweet and spicy notes.  That contrast in composition makes sense in light of the different flavors that the two types of peat produce.  I love the fact that this bottle gives information that even experienced scotch drinkers would not know, but which we would find valuable.  This whisky is ochre in the glass -- just lovely.   Don't expect anything close to the Islay punch coming from this whisky, even if Balvenie refers to it as ""heavily peated.""  The initial notes are all sweet:  frosting sugar, the quintessential Balvenie vanilla, and apple.  It's a well-balanced, albeit at times insubstantial, nose.  Those powerful vanilla and apple aromas are wafting off the glass because that's what you're about to taste.  The cereal, malt sweetness also expresses itself here, and again that earthy, terrestrial peat tethers the palate and prevents it from being too thin.  Some spiced honey threads in and out of the experience.  The finish is mildly drying, and once more the dominant flavors are apple and vanilla frosting.  There is peat here, but not at a level that I'd consider heavily peated."

3.0,"About what you would expect from a lightly peated Balvenie. Depending on the night, I either really like it or think it's average. Honey, citrus, slightly bitter finish. Would love a CS edition, maybe younger with more peat. Sexy tube though."
4.0,"Nose: Oak, light floral aromas, light honey sweetness. A faint earthy smoke, like the remnants of a bonfire. No specific aroma overpowers the others.
  
  Palate: A combination of a light honey sweetness and a relatively subtle peat and smoke. Stronger than expected for a 48% ABV. It's good but IMO there's better options at this price point ($95 for me)."

4.0,Quick hit: Smoked ham; thick.  [Whiskyfest 17]
4.0,"Nose: Light earthy smoke. Vanilla . Slight lemon zest. A bit floral.

Palate: Sharp .Mouthwatering . Oak. Very nice peat, not overpowering but definitely present. Grassy element but light.

Finish: Ashes, earthy peat lingering. Balvenie distillery character honeyed though abit dry and quick"

null,"** Disclaimer: This review is what I would consider a “Quick Hit”- meaning I won’t have my usual in-depth notes that I usually like to take. The reason: this sample was poured at Whiskyfest DC on 4/17/18. All of these reviews will not be scored and I am actively looking to try them again at some point to do them more justice.

I’m down to my final, favorite 3 whiskies from the festival.  I really expected the 21 Port Wood to be up here, but instead I find the 14yo Peat Week.  The really was an excellent dram.

Balvenie doesn’t typically peat their whiskies, but like everyone else (minus Macallan) they switch their distillery over and distill with peat for a couple weeks every so often.  And I must say, perhaps they should do this annually, because this was a damn fine whisky.  There were hints of sweetness floating through the palate, but it was something about the peat in this one- it just tasted so pure (I know that doesn’t make sense, but that’s how it felt).  The mouthfeel was ultra smooth and the finish was soft and gentle, but lingering.  I’m close to scoring this a perfect 5.  It just tasted so good.  I’m glad I have a bottle, but I think I should find another and drink it on special occasions.  It’s fantastic stuff.  Cheers."
3.0,smooth... bit too smooth? so little flavor that the alcohol bite might overwhelm it.

5.0,Smokey!! you get it on the nose and in the taste. Very Peaty. Very smooth.
5.0,It’s got everything. Balvenie Honey with a complementary subtle Peat undertone that cuts the sweetness beautifully. A new favorite.
4.0,Smokey nose but sweet finish. Slight burn on the sides and tip of tongue that quickly subsides.

5.0,"Scotchtoberfest take home. This is an Old Fashioned in a bottle. Syrupy sweetness and smoke. Love it as-is from a flask. Nose is peat and floral with a bit of medicinal benzene that rounds into butterscotch. First sip is smoke and twang. Orange honey? No real burn at 48.5 abv. Medium long finish of hot vanilla smoke. I like this a lot. MSRP is a bit high, but a lovely dram when someone else is paying."
3.75,"A kind of weird sweet peatiness, like a syrupy Talisker. Not sure what to make of this. 88"

4.5,"Nez: Bacon fumé au nez. un sucre plus distant presque floral ou vanillé qui rappelle son petit frère des Caraïbes. 

Bouche: Un gros sel violent et ensuite la tourbe iodé bien présente et marine qui rappelle celle de mon Laphroaig Cairdeas 2017. Puis le sucre vanillé typique de Balvenie. Si Old Pulteney avait un enfant avec Laphroaig, ça donnerait probablement ça. 

Final: Des amandes Fumé. Vanille et chêne brûlé par un matin humide. 

Overall: Stuning! Vraiment un must pour les fafannes de Balvenie. Pour les amateurs de tourbé-salé, vous y trouverez votre compte aussi! Imaginez du Bacon mariné dans le sucre brun. Le taux est parfait en amène une présence aromatiques plus que excellente. Si vous croisé le chemin, ne le manqué surtout pas! 88%"
