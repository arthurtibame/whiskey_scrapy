3.0,This whiskey has a burn going down. Alcohol taste overwhelms the whiskey flavors. Not the smoothest whiskey but not the worst either.
3.25,"Sweet and not too spicy for a high rye. Soft finish, smoother than you’d think. Would buy a bottle."
4.5,#raisespirits I forsee this quickly become a top Tennessee Whiskey. Much better than Jack and George.
4.0,Nice

3.5,"Nose. Mellow. Warm tones. Leather. Maple. 

Taste. Short profile but I think interesting enough. Dark fruits. Does work well with ice and mixed drinks."

3.0,"Nose: leather and cigar.  Smells like a bourbon was meant to smell.  

Palate: I’m getting cherry and vanilla initially.  Quite a burn for a 100 proof. 

Finish: short finish.  Not a lot to say about it other than that.  Saw someone compare the finish to furniture polish (in a good way) and didn’t understand.  After tasting I totally get it. Hard to explain, but that is exactly the best way to describe this bourbon. 

Overall: An average bourbon initially.  I’m interested in seeing how time and possibly a little water or a cube of ice will bring out the flavor.  Will revisit soon."

4.0,Sweet hints of cherry and brown sugar. Soft aftertaste. Light and aromatic scent
3.25,"First pour, on the nose I get maple, baking spices, on the palate I get rye spice and it finishes like a stick of big red chewing gum. Looking forward to seeing how this opens up."
3.5,Good spice. Nice and warm. Too much ethanol to make the short list.
