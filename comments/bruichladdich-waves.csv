4.0,Very inviting nose and palate. Think of Port Charolette Islay but softer and rounder.

4.0,"Only tasted this once. Can't find any longer. Salty seabreeze with rich madeira notes. I miss you, O gentle waves."
4.0,"Light peat notes, lightly sweet. Hints of summer fruits, vanilla, citrus."
2.0,"At the nose, what you get is a very heavy malty flavor, like barley sugar, with some little components of walnut and very very little of honeysuckle and earthy soil flavor(maybe). When you taste it, it's quite smooth and don't have no burn. It's quite the same cereal taste, with some syrup notes but with a fast finish - definitely a cheap finish. It's a little bitter, like gentian plant with that barley sugar end in background. I really can't figure out how this whisky can be compared to other Islay ones."
