3.0,"* Review moved from the listing for Wolfburn Northland

Nose: Crisp, fruity and grassy. White grapes, apple and lemon peel, distant vanilla and some faint ashy smoke.

Palate: A lightly sweet/spicy and hot arrival with some peat smoke and pepper that starts building in the development. The texture is lightly oily but it's a little lacking in depth and complexity. Some fruity notes.

Finish: Medium. Green mango and oily but slightly bitter citrus.

The description for Wolfburn Northland on this site states that it was the first Wolfburn bottling, but that's not exactly correct. There were two previous offerings, of which this was the second. The first bottling was not technically whisky as it was only 20 months old (so it was actually ""aged barley spirit""), but this second expression was 3 years old and their first genuine whisky.

I guess it is arguable that this whisky morphed into the original Northland. Both expressions were produced with the same fermentation, distillation and cask maturation regimes, however as it has evolved Northland has moved away from its early profile.

I first tasted this at a liquor shop event in 2016 and later from a gifted tasting sample in 2018. Although very young and lacking complexity this whisky demonstrated the undeniable style and quality that Wolfburn can produce, and was an excellent first offering and early advertisement for the fledgling distillery.

Apparently the bottling run was quite large but I doubt you'd still find any of this for sale (and frankly I wouldn't bother - as good a start as this was, the more recent Wolfburn expressions have already eclipsed it).

""Above Average"" : 3 stars"
