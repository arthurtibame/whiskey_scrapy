3.5,"Not bad, worth a purchase if you can find it. Potent stuff but not all that complex. I think a 92 rating is a tad over rated. I personally think the Kaiyo Mizunara Oak is much better as Japanese whiskeys go"

A little breath and that shifts over sweet corn, cloves, and a nice kick of baseball glove leather. Damn good and just fun to taste through the cycles."

4.0,"NOSE: Mars bars, vanilla, cinnamon, wood, hints of dark fruits linger from sherry casks.

TASTE: Spicy cinnamon and rich, fresh orange, oily and smooth. Hints of peat come and go. Water brings out more creamy toffee.

FINISH: Lingering sweet spice and creamy, thick mouth feel.

OVERALL: Wonderful blend of everything: toffee, sherry, spice, and hints of peat. Like a variety of styles in one bottle, but the notes play around nicely between each other."

4.25,"This is my first forray into Japanese Whiskey and I decided to start big! I really had no idea what to expect but had heard a lot of good things about this dram and a lot of excitement about it being available stateside. I was hesitant and the bartender poured me a sample. As soon as it hit my lips I was sold. The peat, honey, orchard fruits and the smoothness begged me to move forward with the full pour! When he said it would be $12 for 2oz I was sold. As a Bourbon drinker primarily I have to say this is a perfect segway into Japanese Whiskey. It's sweet with a hint of peat smoke. Smooth with a slight spice bite. It's really not overly complex, but just complex enough to hold my attention. Great pour. I need to add this bottle to my collection. I now understand the hype around Japanese Whiskey! Cheers all!"

Taste: Sweet dark fruits, hot spicy cinnamon sticks, wet wood, Christmas spices, and again even more. 

Experience: it's like stepping into a warm pastry shop on cold morning, so many smells and options it's hard to pinpoint or choose one. The warmth and spices surrounds you and warms you all the way through.

This is becoming one of my all time favorite whiskeys."

Giving 4 stars because of the complexity and because I've never tasted a whiskey quite like this, but still trying to figure out if I actually like it."

4.75,"The nose is sweet and complex.  Oily and rich. This has flavors of candied oranges and apples. Vanilla and hints of toffee. The hint of pepper and spice gives this an interesting kick.
The taste is initially spicy, with an oily luxurious feel.
The finish is long and Intense but satisfying. 
The real magic here is when you add just a little water, an ice cube will work perfectly. The nose softens, gives aromas of peaches and pears. Baked apples and stewed fruit. 
The mouth becomes more inviting, more vanilla, white pepper,  white chocolate and the slightest hint of saltiness. 
The finish shorter and becomes softer, yet no less pleasing.
This is one quality whisky, and the price tag is very generous to match."

4.5,"My first Japanese blend, Nikka from the Barrel! 🥃

I've read a lot of good things about this dram and just had to taste it.

🌕🌕🌕🌕🌘 NOSE •
Nosing it I got notes of toffee and spice, it was very rich. It was joined with notes of oak and vanilla and a hint of sweet butter.

🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗 PALATE •
The palate was very rich with a myriad of spices which were very well balanced on their own. Balancing the spices out were notes of orange and sweet caramel. I feel that the 51,4% ABV was basically perfect for the palate.

🌕🌕🌕🌕🌘 FINISH •
Finishing this blend didn't let you forget and was lasting. Still rich of spices, some cereal notes of grain then oak with a lingering note of hazelnuts. Still some sweetness in there.

🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗 OVERALL •
Keeping an open mind while tasting, I dare say this is one of the best blends I've had. Definitely worthy of a permantent spot on the shelf. I need to repeat that the ABV was very well balanced and fitting for the palate.

Impressed!

4.75,"Nose lacks a little power, but shows some cereal and caramel apple.  A lot of depth in the mouth.  This is a caramel bomb on the palate and it is layered and complex.  Transforms into more dark fruit towards the end and finishes with lingering salt notes.  It’s fantastic.  Has great purity but also incredible richness and darkness.  Unique for Japan to me."

4.25,Smell of honey and caramel. Very sweet dessert like on the nose. On front it hits you very sweet and lingers with more of a burn in the back. Almost a bit of grape on the end. A sweet japanese whiskey that is a delight. Downside is that sometimes it tastes a too much cough medicine-y on certain parts of palate.

4.0,More smoke and peat than the whiskey's I usually buy but not too much that I don't enjoy the hints of it. The aroma is sweet and fruity. It's smooth in the mouth and and tastes like apricot. Very tingly on the finish. I am guessing this is due to the high alcohol content.

The nose is that of oak and orange being smoked.

Palette is complex and incredibly well balanced. Rolls it across your tongue for fruit and spice flavors, hints of rye, briny sea notes and a slightly smoky peat.

Finish is nice and long, tingles the tongue, mostly smoke and spice."

4.5,"So earlier this morning I get a text from a buddy with this bottle and a price tag on showing $64.99. The body of the text states ""Driving thru your city and found this... at a car wash!"" I have to be honest, I thought he was totally full of sh*t! So fast forward a couple of hours and my daughter is done with cheer practice and the wife wants to look at light fixtures. I suggest that we stop by this location as my car did need a wash and I needed to verify this ridiculous proclamation! Low and behold, a freaking $3 car wash actually had 2 bottles of Nikka from the Barrel at SRP! I instantly bought one and tonight decided to enjoy my open bottle! Let's dive into the tasting now that I have had more experience with Japanese Whisky:
it's a soft but viscous entry with a fresh fruit salad (too many to pull) honeycomb and wood. Mid palette adds an array of spices and whisps of smoke and brine. A hint of maple bacon as well. The finish is lengthy with dried plum and black pepper to compliment the wood and spice... then the brine comes back right at the end. The finish does become astringent. 
My goodness this really is an outstanding dram. All in all for the money it's hard to beat. The only slight negative is the astringency on the finish. It's a bit out of balance. Otherwise it's almost flawless. This is also a great exercise in how ones palette changes with experience. My first tasting of this I thought it was smokey. Now with more experience with Islays I find the smoke to be nuanced. 
Cheers all!"

4.5,"Taste Notes by “Whiskey Grilling Time!” (Facebook review Group)

Nose:

Very complex and lingers. Cedar cigar-box and exotic woods are that weird floral note. 

Front:

The smoke and peat accents. A sherry influence is layered into the blend and if you wait long enough, soy sauce, celery and other umami components are part of the drift . 

Back/Finish:

Kampi! This dances across all taste buds with cloves, cinnamon and orange zest seasoned by sea salt . A walnut cigar in the nose is present and accompanies whole experience and than extends  finish. A very rich blend that lingers for days.""

4.5,"Thick, rich, fruity sweet, slightly spicy and smoky. The mouthfeel is outstanding,  just want to roll it around my tongue over and over again. Probably the most complex and layered whisky I've had besides the Highland Park 18, just not quite as well balanced or elegant but still incredibly satisfying. Punches well above its price range. 
Recommend adding 3-4 drops of water to a 1.5 ounce serving and let breathe a good 10-15 minutes while nosing, it'll be well worth the wait! 
If doing flights I'd serve this fairly early in the order despite the high ABV. We did a whisky tasting the other night and this was the last of the 8 bottles that we sampled. It also unfortunately followed a 35 year old J.P Wiser Canadian Whisky. By the time we got around to it our tastebuds were so burned out and overwhelmed by bolder flavoured whiskies that we could hardly taste anything that this amazing blend had to offer. An absolute pity. I'd recommend serving this second or third at most so as to enjoy all of the subtle charms of this Japanese beauty."

4.5,"500 ml bottle purchased in Munich. Loads of fruit on the nose. Apples (so much green apple) citrus, caramel followed by a nice dose of spice and a touch of peat. Fruit fades back in on the finish after adding a touch of water for a mouth watering finish that lasts for days. I’ve heard the international bottle (500ml) and the US bottle (750 ml) have a varying recipes. This is my second taste of this whisky. The first time I had a pour at a bar in Sonoma and I recall it being good, but nothing special (Very little fruit as I recall and more Cedar, spice and tobacco notes). The version I picked up in the duty free shop suits my palate well and seems totally different than the first taste I had. I’d love to try them both side by side and get to the bottom of this."

3.0,"I bought a second bottle of this on hype alone before having a first taste. Sure it has a delicate nose and well balanced taste but come on, so do a lot of other scotch.  it's good but not amazing and certainly not worth driving in a panic to the store where a bottle was sighted.  After chasing all these sought after bottles and whispering ""my precious"", I've been disappointed too many times. it's caused me to have a whiskey meltdown and question what have I been doing with my life and money collecting these bottles. I look at the unopened bottles and just see more disappointment to come.  The whiskey i've really enjoyed are few and not ones being chased.  Noahs Mill, Jefferson's Ocean Cask strength,  Bookers, Baker's,  Peerless. I've never been a follower and this is why.  Somehow I got duped into following the whiskey sheep in my quest to explore the world of whiskey. My curious quest turned into a frantic race for the last bottle on the shelf just because it's what everyone else wants like a Christmas Eve panic to find that over commercialized toy.  It's insanity. The more I watch youtube reviews,  the more I see sponsored influencers and ""kid glove"" tasters who try not to upset any followers/patron. I have a lifetime of whiskey to drink and some of it will taste lovely and interesting and some will taste of regret. Nikka from the barrel was not the only disappointment but it was the straw. Rant complete."

4.0,Solid Japanese whisky. Nice bold body and that lovely lowburn.
3.25,"Found a backup of this, so I guess I can bottle kill this! Mind you 70% of the bottle left so I guess I don't do it tonight.

Nose - sweet and delicate, caramel, hints of earth, a bit of sherry, and yes peat. A deeper nose I get a hint of oak. As it opens I get more and more oak and caramel. A lot more bourbon like than anything else I've seen from Japan. Normally I get a lot more citrus fruits from japan. 

Taste - I get a note that's clearly and distinctly a blend. It opens vanilla, moves to some oak and caramel, then I get sherry, and finally I get some peat and oak. Then on the finish I get that burnt vanilla, oak, and some lingering peat. There are some of those citrus fruits in here, the barrel char is limited, some butter scotch now. 

Complex, nuanced, but I'm wondering if this was chill filtered. It doesn't drink like a 50+% whisky but at the same time I get a nice bit of texture at first. 

Anyway - 70 bucks now. It's very good. I can see why this is winning awards, but it's not for me an award winning level whisky. It's one I'd like to always have on my shelves (or right now in my closet overflow). 

3.25 I just can't go higher given it's a bit thin on the finish and I just don't get any older whisky notes, smooth as heck yes, but it's not giving me older whisky notes. Whisky from Japan is if well made always pretty smooth.

This is where my scoring system feels off. I need a wow note for things as they approach 4.0 but this is just perfect for what it is. Balanced, tame alcohol, refined, complex. This is a whisky where if you like whisky, you'll like this. But will you be wowed? Only if you've not had true wow bottles. I feel like I should add points for just being ""perfect"" in being what it is, but that's not how I've scored other bottles."

I thought slightly out of kilter then looked at the abv and thought eh water and time time. Both along with a fillet steak helped and this came into its own.

Now having stumbled across the some of the greats of Japanese whiskey such as 21 Yr Nikki Yochi a number of years ago and having them be my first taste of Japanese whiskey when I was embarking on my whiskey journey (and thinking $150 USD was an eye watering price!) I've since been simultaneously kicking myself for not buying up and also wading through a lot of disappointing overpriced Japanese whiskey to the point unless it's a new distillery using non sourced stock I've by and large not been interested. This is a refreshing break from that pattern.

Thanks to @cascode I've managed to try a decent example at a very reasonable $50USD. This is at least a 3.75 to 4. Sadly I drank the whole sample before I could discern anything more than I liked it (our cat bit one of the girls among other episodes....). 

Anyhow its good, buy with confidence and add time and water.

Nikka has of late, discontinued products because it cannot keep up with the demand. This has a knock-on effect on FTB.

Where the nose was once rich and inviting with the promise of orange peels, it now is a pale shadow of its former self, taking a backseat due to the abundance of grain.

On the palate, the smokey note, which is key in the old blend, is still there, but they sit so far in the rear that one has to hunt for it.

2/10. Extremely disappointed with my repeat purchase of the new batch of Nikka Whisky FTB.

Cannot recommend in its current state.

4.25,"Nose: neat: sherry, orange citrus, plum, apricot... I let it breath for ten minutes or so and it got a little more tangy, hints of alcohol and tobacco. Later as the etoh burned off more malty notes came through. Also walnuts. 

Few drops of water: more sherry sweetness, just stronger

Body: neat: full, a little creamy and coats the mouth. With a few drops of water: remains full

Palate: neat: sherry, sweetness and tobacco leaf. Also malty flavors. Very minimal pepperiness and spiciness. 

With water the smokiness at the end is stronger and last longer. Really really good. The beginning of the taste has a little more pepperiness with water. 

Finish: neat: long with water long. 

Note: was interested in this since it won whiskey advocate whiskey of the year 2018. First sip had me shaking my head “yes” this dram evolves in waves of deliciousness and the initial impression is “this is how a whisky is supposed to taste”. After two sips my impression is “this is really good”. This is just my style, sweet and smoky. Also after about 2 ounces I felt it a little so for 50+proof that’s pretty nice. Reminds me of the talisker 18 and the Springbank 15. Really excellent stuff. Not as good as the nikka 17"

3.75,"Heads-up this review is a few months behind. I drafted it a while back but it wasn’t ready for posting. Finally got through the spell checks, syntax, etc. Here goes…

My first real Japanese dram. Wasn’t sure what to expect but it wasn’t this. If I tried this on a blind taste, I would have guessed a Scottish Speysider – floral, fruity and enveloped by sherry (READ: sherry-forward). Nonetheless, let’s dig in:

CONTEXT: Paris CDG airport with two of my best buds, waiting to board a flight to Madrid (second stop on a three-city short euro-trip). Our first boys trip together LA 
 --> Paris --> Madrid --> Barcelona --> Paris --> LA. As always, ever since I started my whiskey-collection journey, I always check out the international duty-free. So here I am at Charles De Gaulle airport, on the euro side, and of course had to drop in on the local duty-free. VERY slim pickings at the  CDG “domestic side” duty-free but I did see the Nikka from the Barrel (NftB) on the shelf for $34 Euros. Started to think it might be a good idea to pick up a bottle for night caps with my buds during our trip (keep in mind I already own 3 unopened bottles of NftB in my collection) …but like I said, slim pickings. It was either this, or 1-liter bottles of Glenlivet, and Monkey Shoulder. Apologies in advance from my stereotype-laced judgment but any scotch that’s bottled in 1-liter containers is an automatic No-Go for me! (OK, maybe a couple of exceptions.) My logic – if it was that good, they wouldn’t be [essentially] “giving it away”. But I’m happy to stand corrected. Throw out names of really high quality, 1-liter dufry bottles, and I’ll take it all back. I do have my mind set on picking up the 1-liter bottle of Caol Ila Distiller’s Edition next time I swing through Heathrow. But I digress.
I think I got played (or it felt like it) by the salesperson at the duty-free counter. She apparently had to add back the VAT because I was travelling to another EU country, so our flight was considered a domestic flight.  So no duty free! Urgh…grrrrggh. I call BS! So final price was in the neighborhood of $42 euros, which I think was over $50 bucks after conversion at the time! For a 500ml no less. Too late to pull back now…I already got my boys’ hopes up. On to the tasting! 

So first night cap in Madrid, second night cap in Paris (skipped a night cap in Barcelona) …all worth it

NOSE: Incredible nose…almost bourbon-like! I could nose this indefinitely if time were limitless, and/or I didn’t have other drams to check out. Almost a perfect, albeit, subtle balance of caramel, vanilla and sweet sherry rancio, with a hint of smoke coming in last minute to the party. It’s was as if caramel, vanilla and sherry were heading to an olfactory party and last minute decided to make quick detour to a friend’s and ended up bringing a +1 to the soiree.

PALATE:  Strong sherry influence.  Not yet well-versed on my sherries but I dare guess it’s Oloroso. Vanilla & caramel continue through on to the front & mid-palate from the nose. Some light smoke makes an appearance late but almost apologetically...like it sneaked in through the back door. Simply put, this is a well-balanced dram. Overall, it drank so much more like a sherried scotch. I felt I was missing the “Japanese essence”, although to be perfectly honest, I’m not exactly sure what that means or what to expect from a Japanese whiskey. I have not sampled a lot of them, so my Japanese taste library is relatively scant. Still, a pretty decent dram indeed.

FINISH: Sherry and caramel continue through a relatively short finish. The smoke disappears almost as soon as it appears as if to remind you that it wasn’t supposed to be there in the first place. Light coating on the tongue lingers but can’t quite figure out what the after taste is. Kinda leaves you wanting more but I can’t quite decide whether it’s in a good or bad way. 

FINAL VERDICT: Solid 3.75  -  4 (I could potentially change after I spend more time with this bottle…OR…sample more Japanese whiskies). This one is a bit of an enigma. Noses like a bourbon, drinks a like a Speyside single malt. The die is cast…and the bar has been auspiciously set, my friends. Try, own or pass? I say definitely try! Own…if you can find a bottle at retail."

4.0,"This is a lovely blend.  It’s difficult to pin down the flavour as it keeps drifting to different places, but it’s a delightful mongrel.  To attempt to describe it is tricky, but here goes:  first hit is a fairly sweet, grain taste.  It then moves to a rich fruity, spiciness that lingers for ages.  The finish is a sweet sherry with cloves and salt.  See, all over the place!  Nice, ‘though!"

4.5,"This is a great dram, now i know why it is so famous and guess what? It is cheap. 

51.4%abv, chesnut oloroso sherry color, no fancy story behind it, you can get it from $44-55.

51.4%abv always prepare you for a tough oponent, but this is not the case. The nose is marvelous sweet and citric, no alcohol note at all. Orange, Cocoa powder, Almonds, hazelnut, Milk powder (formula), Coffee beans, Milk chocolate, Toffee, Honey, Cough syrup from childhood. I bet you already know how it smells just by reading this notes. 

Palate is a little powerful and harsh but very enjoyable. Citric and spicy feeling.
Ashy and oaky. 
Starts with a mixture of oak and orange to become a peppery, honey mustard spicyness. Bitter coffee. Very complex. 

Ginger and/or clove aftertaste with a little pleasant burn, long. 

Overall i give it a strong and well deserved 92 out of 100. Its the best nikka whisky i have had up to this date. Go buy it. Slainte! (Or whatever the japanese say when they cheer)."

4.5,"Honestly, every time I took a dram from this bottle, it gave me some flavours I never noticed before. This dram requires a great amount of patience to discover all the amazing smell and tastes! It is full of complexity and character. 

I would say, among all seducing scents it offers, the floral notes (almost like nectar) and Chinese ricecake remembrance are the most impressive to me on the nose. Citrus fruits and honey sweetness dominate the palate but in the end it shows some ginger spiciness, nuttiness and coffee. If you are patient, you might be sensing some faint smoke and brine (a drop of water can help). Finish is medium-long, warm and sweet.

To me, the most amazing thing for this dram is the extraordinary notes of sweet milk chocolate when I nose it right after I swallow. Just wow! I think the magic truly lies in those 100+ barrels and the hands of the master blender."
4.5,"Perfectly balanced as all things should be...

Seriously, I've never had a whiskey balance sweet/salty/smoke/fruity/dry/floral like Nikka from the Barrel. I haven't had the honor of tasting much Japanese whiskey, but compared to what I've had, Nikka FTB is a delight. 

Backstory: I was looking for an ""end of school"" celebration bottle. I arrived at Total Wine and found Nikka from the Barrel and Hibiki Harmony sitting on the shelf next to each other. Two rare blended whiskies from two of the most prestigious Japanese distilleries on the same shelf at the same time.... Lucky me right? I heard great things about both, but I only had enough in my budget for one of them. With much deliberation, I walked away with the Nikka. Why? I was attracted to the simplicity of the bottle, the higher ABV, and I felt that the extra $5 for Hibiki was more of an upcharge for hype and the fancy bottle design. 

The nose is varied with caramel sweetness, vanilla, some floral notes, and leather. The taste was even better! Rich honey, black cherries, some lighter fruits, oakiness, and a tinge of peat and brine. Every subsequent taste brought forth something new as each flavor took a turn on the palate. 

Now I just want to try everything from Nikka! For those who love Hibiki Harmony, no worries! I still want to try it too. Buuuut if I'm being honest, I feel no FOMO for not grabbing the Hibiki because I'm really REALLY enjoying Nikka from the Barrel right now.

*Side note: I don't like the short neck of the bottle. If I don't pour it fast into my glass, it always seems to spill. *Sigh* I just hate wasting good whiskey..."

4.0,"Got the 750ml for ~$60. Initial nose was muted but the palate was nice with some fruity sweetness and a hint of smoke at the finish. 
After letting it open up just a few days, the nose was much sweeter and richer as was the palate with more complexity than the initial tasting. Seems like this is a blend of younger whiskeys but is very enjoyable at the ""barrel proof"". Would definitely buy again at this price."

4.25,"Light golden bodied and thin. Nose of pears, flowers, Sherry, grass and citrus. Taste is complex- initially pear, honey, elderflower, and tea. Later leather, cocoa, and tobacco leaf with subtle hints of smoke, nutmeg and brine. 

It is truly an amalgam of different styles: the lighter scotches and their heavily peated counterparts both play a role with similarities to redbreast and green spot. It’s greatest strength is it’s balance"
5.0,"Rested for ~5 minutes.

APPEARANCE: Light Amber, translucent Gold;

NOSE: Subtle hints of fruit and smokiness; 

PALATE: Delicate floral; Sort of oily; No alcohol taste; Intense rush of fresh fruit;

FINISH: Not a lingering finish; Beautiful."
