4.0,"I’ll be direct - this is hella good. Tullamore has been doing some exciting cask finishes; their most recent, the rum cask finish, is quite enjoyable...but not on this level. The combination of the base whiskey’s smooth, honeyed, fruity, and lightly spicy character with the slightly tart, round cider works perfectly. I hardly even noticed that the ABV is only 40%; there’s a satisfying richness present, with hardly any spirit bite. For $40/liter, this is a great find and probably the best whiskey I’ve had from Tullamore."

4.0,a little hot. but add about a thimble full of water let it sit for around 4 mins and then is sweet heaven. I love Tullamore so I'm biased. nice sweet almost cinnamon quality without it being cinnamon. I enjoy it. and in the end it's all about individual Tate's and satisfaction. don't let someone tell you what drink try for yourself you'll be surprised what you like.

4.0,"Sweet, smooth, crisp.  Everything you would expect from a classic Irish Whiskey."
4.0,"Sweet. Mellow, easy drinking"
2.25,"This is one I was really hoping I’d love and while it’s not awful it leaves a lot to be desired. There’s a distinct rubbing alcohol note on the nose which is a little off-putting. I was expecting more of the cider cask to come through. On the palette it’s got the typical Tully flavor with a hint of cider and to my taste just a hair more astringent. I do get a nice crisp cider note on the finish but it’s fleeting at best.

The rubbing alcohol note does fade after some time in the glass so I’m curious how the bottle will be after a little oxidation. Not a bottle I’m upset to have picked up but not one I’ll grab again."

3.0,"Nose has hints of vetiver and orange zest. Palette is a bit harder to pin-point, but on the tail I’m finding a strong sense of golden raisin.  If I didn’t know this was from Tullamore, I certainly wouldn’t have guessed it."
3.0,"Thanks to @The_Rev for providing a generous pour, I got to try another Tullamore Dew.  So far, I’ve had three:  loved their 14 yr old, wasn’t fond of their Rum finish, and this one sits nicely in-between.  The nose is weak, but the palette is where all the action takes place.  The cider provides a nice crispness to the underlying sweet notes; a faint hint of fall...too bad I’m having this in the rainy balmy 85 degree NJ weather.   Interesting experiment.  Thanks @The_Rev!"

3.25,"Impressively gentle and smooth, but there almost nothing there.  Cider notes are plain and clear on the palate... kind of a viscous Strongbow.  Drinkable and certainly not off-putting, but forgettable."
2.0,"after letting rest for 10 minutes, I smell apples, honey, and vanilla. Very sweet taste. again, apples dominate with vanilla and honey in the background"

3.0,Not really ‘better’ than the standard Tully but definitely different. More apple on the nose and palette. It’s worth a couple bucks more every now and again for a change of pace. But keep in mind the XO rum cask is a bit better and higher ABV for the same money.

3.75,Bec's pick of the Irish Whiskeys. So fruity and gentle on both nose and palate. Easy drinker for me but not my palate.

4.0,"To be honest, my palate must not be developed enough. It tastes like regular Tullamore DEW. I guess I'll just have to try again with a side-by-side test..."
2.25,"Red apples comes theough both nose and taste wise. Light in taste. Fragrant. The fruitiness seems a bit artificial though. Some grain bitterness. 

Nah, doesn’t really come together that well for me. It’s ok at best. Wouldn’t buy again, but a bit of fun having tried. I prefer the original to this by a small but unmistaken margin."

2.75,Light citrus. Green apple flavor.
4.0,"Nose: cider, coffee, stout
Palate: honey, stout, sour cider
Finish: Apple, oak, chocolate stout

With some oxidation this got really interesting!"
4.5,the sweetness of the cider really does come through
2.75,"Really needs a little water to open up. Otherwise it's just taste young and hot and very little of the cask subtleties come through.

After that it's better, but forgettable. Tastes more ethanol-ly than even the cheapest tulla."

4.25,"Twist on irish, slightly. Tough to compare critically, but I'm enjoying it"
2.75,Enjoyed on the rocks.  Taste is a little tart.  This one wasn't very memorable.
3.0,I was expecting much more 'apple flavour' in this one but was very disappointed and suspect it needs a little water to improve and bring out the flavor.
3.0,Sweet. Heavy cider. Not as smooth as rum finish.

2.75,"A little disappointing. I was hoping the cider cask finish would add a little more flavor, but this was basically standard Tullamore DEW plus a very slight hint of apple sweetness. I won't seek it out again; I honestly preferred the taste of the standard Tullamore."
