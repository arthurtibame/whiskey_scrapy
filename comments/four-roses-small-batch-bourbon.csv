4.25,"Despite the spicier, less drinkable, finish I’d expect from the price tag, this is a well bodied bourbon with some great spices and enjoyable charred flavors that I appreciate. Good depth. That being said, I don’t know that it’s better than the single barrel product that’s also extremely flavorful."

Nose - caramel, vanilla, cherry, brioche

The only setback is the lack of complexity and depth of the finish. This is a perfect example of a successful 20th century survival of the dark ages of bourbon. It’s a drinker, not a shelf trophy!"

The issue with small batch is that all flavors are surprisingly faint and sometimes hard to find which, I think, removes a lot of the complex aspects of this drink. Decent but not for it's price."

The first time I tried tasting this, I gave up because all I could get was that oak but with a bit of water, those more fruity and spicy notes open up quite a bit. Surprisingly less spice on the taste, more sweet fruits come through for me with a bit of spice in the background that lingers out for the finish."

3.75,"Really nice spicy nose. I've let it sit for a while, which I don't usually do with a whiskey but I guess I'm testing my patience levels. I also found some beautiful floral notes and an almost buttered toast smell to it? A nice oak rounds it out and it brings forth a very nice, but not unique whiskey. A lot of rye spice on the taste with little hints of berry but that spice flavor is very overpowering today for some reason. The finish, however, is very nice with just a lingering vanilla. Some water really brings out those nicer berry/apple notes and makes it pop a lot more than before."
3.75,"Decided to give this a try after the 2019 Whiskey Advocate annual ranks came out (I realize the select is the one in the top rankings, but I haven't found that one in stores yet). Tried side by side with the Four Single which I quite enjoy. The nose is sweet on this one. First taste is surprisingly spicy. Almost to the point it robs the dram of its potential. Once it mellows the corn starts to come through in a strong way followed by a red hot candy finish.   Overall a nice pour for the price point, but I'd pay the little extra for the single barrel in my opinion."

4.25,"Take Four Roses and give it an aroma I could wear as an aftershave/cologne throughout the day, given how oaky and masculine it is, and make it so smooth that you can easily drink it two fingers at a time throughout dinner.

2.75,"Slightly disappointed on drink 5 of this tasting session, as I wished that Four Roses held it's own a little more against my previous pours of Woodford and Buffalo Trace. It seems to be a bit too oak heavy for my taste. It's not bad by any mean but the previous tastings in this session just seem to put it to shame. A little water opens up a few more caramel notes but otherwise, it seems to be a generic bourbon. I don't know if that's an issue with my palate tonight or what. It's not bad by any means. It's got the lovely vanilla and caramel notes that bourbon is known for, but I'm not finding much else tonight. After letting it sit for a while, I found a bit more spiciness and candy-flavors but still not the biggest fan."

I didn't like it initially but I'm starting to discover some lovely fruit notes and a nice toffee flavor that rounds out that spice from the rye and vanilla oak. The flavor has some really nice sour berry notes to it that really compliment that strong cinnamon flavor nicely with a lovely vanilla and cinnamon-sugar finish.

4.0,"After years of hearing how good this is, I finally decided to get a bottle of Four Roses Small Batch

Look: Dark straw, amber colored. Really, looks like that scene in Jurassic Park where they extract the Dino dna from the mosquito, except appetizing. Alcohol legs with swirling.

Nose: This seems pretty mild - cinnamon, barrel, vanilla. Your usual bourbon notes. Digging further may give you a little cherry, but that’s about it. Swirling opens up more cinnamon and brown sugar notes.

Palate: after swirling, I wanted to dig right in, and was rewarded with brown sugar and oak. Not so much cinnamon, but a very nicely balanced bourbon between sweetness and spice. More oak than I’d have figured. On my third sip, I noticed what I think was chocolate, which was neat as I’ve never picked that up before I’m whisky. 

Finish: there’s more heat than the nose led on, bitterness in the finish and a strong woody presence. 

Overall: Maybe a little underwhelmed, but that’s because the bar set for all of bourbon is so high with bottles in a similar price. Even though I’m underwhelmed, I still really enjoy this bourbon, but the oaky bitterness is what turns me off."

3.5,"Classic Bourbon. When I think of Bourbon, I think of this. It’s just plain good bourbon with no funny business.

Smell is tough to place for me. Seems a bit spice forward with light fruit notes. Bit of cinnamon with some nutmeg.

Traditional cinnamon and caramel flavors you expect in a bourbon with some sweet honey and fruit notes.

Not sure if I love the after taste or not, but it’s heavy on honey and sticks around quite a bit. But other than that, it checks all the “bourbon boxes”. Slam dunk of a go-to bourbon for me."

For me the kicker is the honey lemon notes that I get.  Halls Honey Lemon Eucalyptus to be exact.  Particularly on the finish and the post-finish breath in.  This is cold medicine for adults! It also makes a great Old Fashioned, a classic Manhattan, and an elegant Boulevardier."

3.25,"After my 4R SiB experience i wasn't sure what to expect, but I know I enjoyed the 2019 LE and the Small batch select my friend so graciously gave me a few weeks ago. So without wasting too much energy on a review that has been rated almost 4,000 times already and has been around for a long time I'll leave a quick review...... 

The 4R Small Batch is a great every day drinker. Nothing that will stand out but will hold it's own to a buffalo trace or eagle rare. Not as sweet as the BT products but has a nice ""traditional"" bourbon taste. After tasting the majority of the standard bourbons on the shelf i'm finding myself to enjoy the Heaven Hill and Wild Turkey products more and more over the BT and 4R stuff and they are usually on the shelves. WT101 is probably the most underrated bourbon out there along with EW BiB or SiB. I know I sidetracked on this review but to me this is good comparison in notes ror myself to where this 4R SB lies. Either way, I put this one in my decanter on my work desk to sip daily. Overall I'm okay with spending sub $30 on this one.

It is quiccly overpowered by floral notes, cherry and a subtle hint of spice, maybe pepper or liquerish.

On a ending note, pleased with the flavour and not overpowering whatsiever. Will definitely be purchasing a bottle on my next trip to the liquor store."

Hints of cinnamon, caramel, and a variety of spices all come together to create one unique and pleasant bourbon experience. Drinking this on a cool evening curled up by the fireplace is a recipe for a great night"

Nose: Rye, vanilla, oak, baking spice, stone fruits, menthol
 
Palate: Rye, vanilla, oak, stone fruits, oily

Finish: Lingers with rye spice biting on the tongue, oak, vanilla and candied fruit

This is an easy sipper. Out of the gate, on the nose and palate, you're presented with the quintessential bourbon notes. In the background stone fruits are making themselves known adding richness and depth. The finish lingers with some sharp edges from the rye spice. In there somewhere you may find candied fruit notes. Vanilla and oak ever present seem to have a drying affect on the tongue. Single Barrel definitely overshadows Small Batch but, if you're looking for something that doesn't break the bank as much, go with the latter."

This would be great in a mixed drink, but it’s also good enough to have on its own."

I find this whiskey growing on me the more I sipped it. It's about $5-$8 less than the Four Roses Single Barrel, if I were you I'd just go for the Four Roses Single Barrel, but if you have a sweet tooth, Four Roses Small Batch might be more towards your liking. Nothing wrong with this whiskey and very true to the 4 star rating, good whiskey for a good price."

3.75,"In direct taste test vs. Angle’s Envy (AE).

Both are really good and have very similar profiles.

Despite having a slightly lower proof,  the AE had a more pronounced alcohol smell,  and seemed thinner on the tongue.

By comparison the Four Roses (4R) had a richer nose and taste;  and is my winner.

If had more AE, I’d set up a blind test to confirm my impressions.  Feel like I may be shortchanging AE in that regard. 

They are very close, but the 4R has a distinct cost and availability advantage; which provides me with some comfort in making the call with limited head-to-head tasting."

Nose - cinnamon, vanilla and cherries

Taste - starts really smooth and oily on the tongue. Get some honey and more cinnamon with a smooth burn as a finish. 

Overall and value
To be readily available and under 30$ to be so enjoyable and drinkable this one is pretty solid. Value being its better than many 30$ bottles I’ve had and more complex. This will be a bottle to keep in your stock for sure."

4.5,"2 words: wood grain. This starts with a nice, friendly caramel base that quickly transitions into a bold and complex wood grain flavor, that allows me to taste more different types of wood notes than any other whiskey I've tried. Some are spicy and fresh while some take longer to develop and seem darker, older, and more subued. The simultaneous different wood flavors makes it a bit ""spiky."" It also seems to seep into your tongue bit, lingering afterwards in for up to a minute.

Would highly recommend if you're looking for a bold, oak forward bourbon, or a whiskey that can hold its ground and add some complexity to a cocktail."
