5.0,"I am also a scottish whisky drinker but this has an amazing amount of complexity without the weight of a scotch. very easy drinking, definitely strong chocolate notes. it's only downside is that it is so easy drinking that i drink it too quickly."
5.0,"Light, sweet, and honey-like, the palate doesn't disappoint. And just when I thought it couldn't get better, I'm treated to a tropical sensation of pineapple/passion fruit after the initial inhale. It then ends on a grassy, herbaceous note adding yet another dimension to this lovely whisky. One of my top 3."
5.0,"So smooth and full of joy keeps you coming back for more soon as that last sip leaves your pallet. Most definitely a whiskey to always have on hand for company, a whiskey tasting, or just a night on the couch."

I like this whisky. It does however have a characteristic that it shares with Bowmore 15...cat piss. It tastes like it smells.  Might seem weird but it is what it is. Even more weird it still tastes great.  It's not one dimensional though, lovely oak and other aspects and in it's early days of opening the bottle lovely light oiliness. In tastings of up to 15 bottles I've run it's been a crowd favourite"

You can't get a comparable 21 yr old for the same price, but you can certainly get better quality for the same price, even if it's less than 21 yrs.  Like a Talisker 10, Balvenie 12, Yamazaki 12, and countless others.   Retasted 1/6:  This time from a bottle as opposed to a bar sample.  Much better second time around---warm bread pudding with a tinge of chocolate.   Really good for the price."

5.0,"Visual:  In the glass it is a medium amber color/gold color. Medium, lasting legs after a swirl.

Nose:  Not hot at all, but that’s not surprising given the age and the 40% ABV. The nose is very sweet, with essences of honey, brown sugar and dried fruits. I tasted this against the Tyrconnell 10-year Port Cask Finish, since I’m doing a dive into Irish whiskeys. If the Tyconnell had a little crème brulee, this dram has it in spades, with a lot more vanilla. The time that a portion of the juice spent in ex-bourbon casks likely accounts for the vanilla, with the sherry casks lending the fruit – at least that’s my guess.

Palate: The expert review on Distiller says trail mix, and that’s no lie. The palate fairly bursts with nuts, dried fruits, and white chocolate covered raisins. There’s also a bit of dark chocolate bitterness pre-finish.

Finish:  The finish is not as long as I expected, but isn’t too short, either. A malty flavor follows the dram down, and is accompanied by continued dark chocolate bitterness, and a bit of tannin dryness. 

Empty glass:  Mocha flavored coffee, diluted with copious cream and sweetened with brown sugar and a touch of Frangelico.

This is a pleasing dram through and through. Comforting, smooth, and oh, so drinkable. Do I think it merits the 97 points that Distiller gives it?  Probably not. The styles are worlds apart, so it’s like an apples-to-oranges comparison, but this dram isn’t in Talisker 10 territory in terms of quality and point rating, in my opinion, and it is also pretty expensive these days. I would probably give it a 90, which is about a “five-star minus” in my estimation."

4.0,"I was traveling for work and decided to browse the wares at a liquor store unfamiliar to me and stumbled upon Bushmills 21. While I tend to stick with scotch because of my love of peat I had a friend rave about this before and decided to give it a go for what seems to be a fair price of $127. 

The nose has fruit a plenty in the red and tropical variation. The sweetness is cut (not in a bad way) by a spice I can’t put my finger on but what is important is this really balances the Irish out nicely.    
Palate instantly gets honey, lemon, the sweet fruits and macadamia. The feel of this whisky really reminds me of my very limited experience with dry wine. Maybe I am just not used to whiskey being this dry but this adds another dimension to the identity of this dram. 
The finish is oh so dry moving from the sweetness of the fruit notes to a pleasant spiciness.

While I usually wish a whiskey at 80 proof has a higher ABV I don’t think this one needs it. It is a very pretty whiskey and I would wager anyone claiming to be a whiskey fan would be hard pressed to not find something they like in here. At the very least it is a unique whiskey and I am a happy sipper indeed.

4.75,"Well, I’ve been absent from reviewing whisky for a little over a month now:  chalk it up to fatigue, being overworked or the fact that I want to ball up in the fetal position over the state of the US stock market and the devaluation of my 401k.  Pick one, they’re all accurate.

Anyway, I was digging through my pile of samples and spotted this pour that I received from John (over on the Barreled app), via @Generously_Paul:  the Bushmill 21 year old Irish whiskey.  This is from the 2015 Batch, bottle #5580 to be exact.  It’s bottled at 40% and I’m not sure what the price point was- perhaps John can chime in here if he remembers.  This sample was sent to me back in the early spring, so even he may have moved on.

The appearance is copper gold and giving it a spin produces fat, quick-running legs and heavy droplets around the rim.  Weirdly enough, it appears oily and watery at the same time.  I suspect it’s the low ABV leaving this thing caught in between both.  Oh well, how does it smell and taste?

The nose is fantastic:  red berries in the forefront with wafts of tropical fruits, honey, tea leaves left me smiling from ear to ear.  A light, minty backbone sealed the deal with apples and faint oak.  This is a damn fine Irish whiskey just to nose.

The palate arrives with those same red berries on the tongue.  Toffee and bittersweet chocolate threw me a delightful curveball by the mid sip point and it’s incredibly smooth and warming, even for 40%.  The Barrel makes itself known at the tail end- which is always appropriate in my opinion.

The finish is medium length, smooth and oily once again, with lingering oak notes before ultimately turning dry.  It’s that dryness that makes you want to go back in.  Ah, those crafty Irish lads:  How do we make people drink more, they must’ve thought- make it dry at the very end- make ‘em thirsty again.  Lol.

Overall, this is amazing juice.  You can tell it’s well aged and it has one of the better overall flavor profiles I’ve ever had in an Irish whiskey.  A huge thanks to John for seeing that I get to try this incredible dram.  I think I might need to source a full bottle for myself, regardless of price.  It is that damn good.  4.75 stars.  Cheers, my friends."

4.5,"Visual:
This dram has a very beautiful amber/toffee color.  It nicely coats the inside of the glass, producing some medium sized, slow moving tears.

Nose:
Very sweet with a hint of a floral note.  Honey and caramel dominate up front, but eventually give way to ripened banana.

Palate:
Starts off with a mild peppery heat, but the heat is quickly cut by the sweetness of honey and toffee.  It has a great creamy mouthfeel that coats your tongue.  This is definitely a sweeter whisky, but not excessively sweet.  

Finish:
There is a nice medium to long finish on this one.  The heat comes back initially, but is quickly replaced with caramel, toffee and honey.  Occasionally I caught a subtle note of tiramisu at the very end.

Note:
This is one that I will try to always have in my collection.  I think it is well worth the price at ~$115/bottle, and would make a excellent gift. 


My Rating Scale:
5 - Outstanding - Hide this bottle when guests come over. 
4.5 - Amazing - Must always have a bottle on hand.
4 - Great - Would gift to close friends.
3.5 - Very Good - Recommend without reservation.
3 - Good - Solid bottling that I would never turn down.
2.5 - Fair - Would drink again, but probably not seek out.
2 - Not Good - Will finish it, but would not order again. 
1.5 - Bad - Can finish if need to be polite. 
1 - Horrible - Would recommend friends should avoid. 
.5 - Nope - Spit that back into glass and dump it out."

Nose: Pipe tobacco, rich sherry notes, fig, dates, toffee, dark chocolate, walnuts. 

Palate: The proof is a little disappointing and it feels watery. But the flavors are still amazing. I can only imagine how amazing a cask strength version would be. A lot of the nose carries through on the palate. Milk chocolate covered dates and walnuts. Honey, sweet tobacco, biscuit and fig preserves. A beautiful whiskey but I’m just left wondering what if...if the proof where at least 46 or higher."

The finish is long and warming, with a generous tongue-coating walnut bitterness to it. What’s the catch? I must be spoiled by hefty cask strength bourbons and single pot still Irish whiskies like Redbreast because this just seems muted by the regulation 40% alcohol. At this extravagant price point (where I could get Redbreast 21 or CC40) it’s just not up to scratch."
4.25,null
5.0,"Appearance: The color of this lovely Irish single malt is a honey gold. And very thin legs cling to the glass interior.

Nose: The nose is gorgeous and very fruity! Notes of apricot and peach, red wine and dark fruits, pecans and raisins, all waft out of the glass, and following behind all that is a salty and semi-smoky aroma.

Taste: The palate is amazing almost comes off sweeter than the nose. It still possesses the peach note, but in the form of those Peach Rings gummy candies. Other notes I find are caramel covered green apple, strawberry flavored candy, with a minimal smoke and brine influence.

Finish: The finish does linger, but it humbly yet confidently departs without needing praise or thanks. Much like Adam West’s Batman with Robin at the end of the movie. (Minus the repelling down a building)

Thoughts: I want to say “Thank you!” to Micah, my co-worker, for this sample! I probably would not have tried this whiskey otherwise. I think this is definitely one of, if not THE best Irish whiskeys I’ve had to date. It is expensive, but man if you’re looking for a treat, this will treat you! That’s for sure! I strongly recommend trying it! Bushmills, I take my hat off to you for this one! Sláinte!"

4.5,"Nose- Juicy pears; shortbread; green apples; wood spice; touch of honey

Palate- Wave of green apples initially; floral spice; milk chocolate; date syrup

Finish- medium, oily and thin; mangoes; wood spice; chocolate covered nuts


Unbelievably drinkable. A bit thin at times, and not the longest finish in the world, but it’s delicious. If it wasn’t 40%, it would be an insta-buy for me. Somewhere from 46-50% would make this bottle amazing. Regardless, lovely notes of fruits, chocolate, honey sweetness, and a touch of oak make this whisky very enjoyable."
4.25,"Smelling this, it seems like some generic scotch. Drinking it though, wood hits first and just as the wood is starting to become tedious, the duck introduces some citrus fruit and floral notes mixed with some brine and smoke. The sweetness grows toward the finish, whish is simply perfect. This is like Glenmorangie Nectar D'Or mixed with Highland Park 18 that finishes with a flavor of mild gummy bears and rosewater. I'll need to try this again to be sure that it is actually this amazing, but my opinion as of now is that it edges out highland Park 18.
On second taste, it is half way between Highland Park 18 and Oban 14, perhaps with a touch of caramel a la Don Julio 1942.
The banana and mango are right there and so rich, but not gross in their sweetness and do not add any weird flavors. Apples come in too for a bit and they dance with pears. There is a salt and a tad of seawater too. One could catch this whiskey on the technicalities, but it's flavor is amazing and when I want to drink something, this is one of the first ones that I think of in most circumstances. Following an Islay, this is a sweet delight. No matter the circumstances though, this is deep and, frankly, a triumph.
How is this so much like the Bushmill's 16, yet also clearly so much better?
Whereas Highland Park 18 makes an impressive entrance and is strong throughout, Bushmill's 21 makes a somewhat weak entrance but stays around for a powerful finish.
This tastes like a less woody but more punchily fruity and floral version of Tullibardine 25. It's good - great, actually - but it definitely tastes younger. I really wish that this were bottled at a higher ABV and not chill filtered. The alcohol is really too strong here. There's so much delicious flavor in here that it is a tragedy that the bad flavors counter-balance it. This has less complexity and balance than Redbreast 21, but its sweet nectar flavor is just so delightful. Then there are the bitter undertones though.
Slightly better than Highland Park 18. This is the closest to perfection that I have come so far.
A couple steps shy of perfection, but still a unique and delightful drink. The nose does not come across as particularly old, but the palate is rich and balanced. The flavors starts a bit bitter and bland, but then apricot and orange with some mild spices come out, blooming into a rich, sweet flavor that develops into s fruity, floral finish. The alcohol is only present in the beginning and while there are some minerals throughout, they are not overwhelmingly strong. The beautiful finish really makes this an exceptional whiskey; otherwise it's not terribly exciting. The richness is good and the balanced flavor in the finish is immaculate, but it needs more complexity and punch with reduced alcohol and minerality. A higher ABV release could also be helpful. The smoothness is terrific though.
The flavor is initially sweet with some delicious orange flower, apricot, honey, orange peel, and caramel, but some aggressively bitter wood comes in. The bitter wood takes over and leaves an unpleasant finish. There is some smoke, but it is piercing and out of place. What a divine flavor at the front and a disappointment that it is not fulfilled.
This is richer with substantially more apricot than Glenfiddich 14. It lets more bitter alcohol through than it should, but it also has some really delightful fruit flavors leaping out, demanding to show their talents. The net flavor could use some more complexity and less alcohol, but those beautiful notes are quite good. There's a lot of vanilla here and the flavor is quite full and rich while also being on the sweet side. It's quite nice to drink, but it just isn't one of those undeniable classics."

4.0,"Nose: Oak cask - that's the first note - old oak cask, and that aroma permeates everything else on the nose. It's a rich, almost funky aroma of dark fruits, stone fruits, nuts, berries, toffee, wine, dark honey and old leather trousers (!), but everything has been aged almost to the point of decomposition. I don't think you could let this sit in the casks for one month more before it fell apart. There's a singular mustiness about the nose that you either love or hate, and after a while the aroma tends to fall into a brown-sugar amalgum.

Palate: There is this thing that old Irish whisky does that transports you away on a wave of silvery, satiny, glistening cereal flavours and it happens here in spades. Peaches and apricots, mangoes, guava and soursop on the arrival, served on a day-old barley-meal trencher with caramel sauce. The texture is silken, velvety and gripping from the oak presence. Slightly drying and oaky as it evolves, very elegant and even more dry towards the finish with an autumn-leaf/tobacco character.

Finish: Medium. Dry, almost astringent, dark chocolate and oak. The aftertaste is all dark chocolate and funky mustiness.

An interesting and slightly unusual nose coupled with one of the most indulgent palates I've tasted. There is nothing demure about this whisky - it's Mae West dancing to Peter Gabriel's Sledgehammer as covered by Madonna.

Yummy and singular stuff. I remarked in my review of Bushmills 16 that it was the first Bushmills that I had tasted that I really liked, and this is definitely the second, but to be honest it's in firm second place behind the 16.

There is something that tries too hard about this whisky. I very much enjoyed tasting it but whereas I'd buy a bottle of the 16 at $120, I wouldn't be seeking out a bottle of this at the asking price of $240.  It's wonderful - almost mandatory - to taste, but not something to own.

I'm rating it as equivalent to the 16 year old expression, but for completely different reasons, and in my opinion the official Distiller score here is amusingly doe-eyed and inflated.

Tasted from a 30ml sampler.
