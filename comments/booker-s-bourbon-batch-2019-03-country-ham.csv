4.0,"Nose- Oak, orange peel, vanilla

Palete- sweet citrus, light honey, oak follows through towards the end, outer tongue burn, smooth

Finish- delayed chest warmth as the tongue burn resides, medium to long finish

Overall: Enjoyed this very much, the smooth sweet fruit notes and unique finish makes this."
4.75,"This is my first Bookers of any sort. 2019-03 “Country Ham.”  2oz pour into a highball glass at a bar in Whitefish, Montana. 

Nose: fruit forward. Cherries, citrus, vanilla, caramel.  After the glass sat for a bit I could pick up the Beam peanuts. 

Pallet:  cherry bomb with some citrus tartness, nice rich plums, flowed by vanilla and caramel.  The finish has the warming Kentucky hug. And the finish goes on. 

Overall:  I loved it.  Loved the strong cherries and vanilla.  I’ve been wondering about this one, and now if I want to treat myself, I’d spend the $85 for a bottle."
4.0,"Nose: vanilla, orange, ethanol, almond, tobacco 
Palate: orange citrus explosion, oily, subtle barrel char
Finish: very long, cinnamon and orange explosion, hot, leather"

4.75,Amazing flavors.  Long finish.
4.0,"Poured neat in Glencairn at home.  Nose has vanilla, caramel, baking spices, stone fruit. Some heat coming through.  Taste has more spice and heat, apples, clove, orange peel, lite meadow grasses, red hots.  Long lingering spicy finish.  Great stuff.  9/14/19"
4.5,I’m on my third bottle of this batch. This batch is very smooth with fruit and a little smoke at the end.
3.75,"Nose:
Oak, spice, sandalwood, hint of vanilla, sweet corn, sweet oak, barrel char, bbq, funky Dusty corn
Palate:
Cinnamon, sweet oak, sweet corn

4.25,Wow.  Explodes at first sip.
4.5,"Fruity, oaky goodness. This is my second time having Booker’s, and first time owning a bottle (can’t pass up $58 at costco!). The last one I had was way before I got into whiskey as deeply as I have now. 

First pour, watered down with a couple splashes. I get malts, oak wood, vanilla and ripe fruit. Longggg, rich finish - looking forward to working up to sipping this neat. Classic"

3.5,"On my way to Trader Joe's for dinner ingredients I decided to hit Fox's to see what new pours are available ....

Booker's Country Ham Batch was one I had been wanting to try so decided to pull the trigger on it, let's dive in... 

Definitely sweet Booker's... Oak, Vanilla, dense brown sugar, toffee covered peanuts and long oaky finish! Better than Teresa's (unless you prefer spicy Booker's) but not as balanced as Shiny... Cheers all and TGIF!!"

4.75,"Nose: Oak, char, toffee, vanilla, buttermilk biscuits fresh out the oven.  Proof is definitely evident.  Deep, dark, rich caramel.  Lemon oil, mint.

Palate: Classic Booker's.  Oak and vanilla take center stage.  As they fade, honey and char show up.  Tannin and barrel bitter.  Eucalyptus, cherry.  Buttermilk biscuits dusted with a little extra raw flour come back through the palate.  Long, oily, prickly finish.  Dusty bookstore."

4.25,Said it once and I’ll say it again. Not too many whiskies on the market that are uncut/unfiltered from barrel to bottle. The consistent vanilla with spiced brown sugar greets you as the subtleties linger throughout the finish. Which lasts!

4.75,"Yum. Another knockout release from Beam Suntory. Nose is fiery at first, but give it a few mins to breathe and you'll get a rich mix of toffee, cherry, vanilla, even chocolate. Hits the palate like a bomb in the finest Booker's tradition - again, best let this one air out for a few minutes. Get used to the heat and you'll discover an intense blend of spices, black pepper, oak, tobacco, and caramel. Some sweeter notes then linger: cordial cherries, a hint of molasses, and is that a little Jim Beam vanilla sneaking in? You'll have time to think about it because the finish is LONG. More approachable (no need to water or ice it down) and complex than the last release, while still delivering on what makes Booker's great. A classic."
1.5,"So I haven't had a bookers in years before this and frankly, I've never been a fan. It's just young whisky that comes in super hot to me, but people keep raving about it and this batch got all kinds of love. I figured what the heck. I also jokingly told Jason of The Mash and Drum he's buying the bottle if it sucks.

Anyway bottle been open about 3 weeks and I've had about 3 maybe 4 pours out of it. Also of note, I just broke the plastic holder in half pulling it out. What a cheap box.

Nose - the alcohol is not muted here 62.35% and coming in at baby young 6 years 4 months and 2 days. Dusty oak, corn, a bit of a red fruit (you could convince me it's an apple). Dusty is my word for this one, I'm expecting a lot of peanut better when I dig in. Water cuts the heat but I'm not getting any new elements here. 

Taste - Caramel up front, fades into nutty and oaky beam profile. A bit of water and I get corn alcohol new make elements (that sweet new make spirit, very sweet but simple). Maybe some vanilla but I'm just expecting it as it's bourbon. Maybe some corn nuts and there might be a slightly salty element to this. 

It's not bad and if you want high proof whisky it's nice to have something this high proof around. But this isn't a high quality bourbon, it's not even close to being one. This is young, it drinks young, it's simple, it's boring, and water doesn't bring out anything else. There's no transition, the finish is mostly alcohol heat even taken below 40% and some dusty corn and nutty beam notes. No cherries, no cola, no leather. 

I'm going with a 1.5 here. Anything over a 1 is well made whisky. 2 means it's actually reasonably well made but not something to seek out unless this is your wheel house. This is just too young, lacks maturity, and I won't even get into price. Maybe I should drink it on ice but at this point I have more water than whisky in my glass and it hadn't changed any flavor points."

4.0,"Taste:  1.5 oz in glen cairn, neat

Nose (4.0):  Candy corn and brown sugar on the nose.  There is some dark red apple as well.  The nose certainly hides the high ethanol well without being overly sweet.

Palate (4.25):  Thick caramel, red apple almost like a taffy apple.  I get some maple syrup with a nice smokiness  in the background.  The palate is full and rich.  There is a slight bitterness on the final note that detracts a bit.

Finish (4.0):  honey and clove with a bit of cinnamon stick.  There is some barrel spice and oak to round it out.  The finish is rougher and more in your face.

Overall:  I enjoyed this one, and the name Country Ham really reflects it well.  If you could put that initial whiff that you get when you walk into  a Cracker Barrel restaurant into a whiskey it would be THIS bourbon.  What struck me odd is that to me there isn't any signature peanut flavor.  That's not a bad thing, but it is a bit of a departure from previous releases."

3.5,Have had the bottle open for about 2 months now. Nice nose but has some off putting flavor to my palate. I see its rated highly but tastes like a young whisky with noticeable alcohol burn!
4.75,"Neat. Neck pour.  Immediately Booker’s but also something more.  That nutty blast is still there on the nose but there is depth here that was not there on the prior two releases.  So much ripe red fruit.  Cherries, raspberries, strawberries.  Some citrus too, orange peel.  Now lemon.

The nose is quite surprising...

Texture surprises too.  What the hell, this is the craziest Booker’s.  First sip and I think I should buy another immediately...

Back to the texture...  it’s watery but not thin.  Milky?  Tons of vanilla on the tongue initially.  On the taste comes the nuttiness but it subsided into all of those fruits yet again.  Intense legs on this too.  Vanilla and oak all the way down for miles and miles.

Top of mind, best Booker’s regular release ever.  The Booker’s qualities I love but then so much more.  The watery texture may be the only disappointing trait but calling it watery when it has legs for miles seems odd.  After hating the last two releases, Country Ham makes me love Booker’s all over."
4.25,"Best of the 2019 lineup so far, rich nose, sweet and smooth"

4.0,"Had a pour straight from a bottle that had been kept in my cold car, so it was essentially chilled.

Initial flavor note was overwhelmingly brown sugar and cinnamon. As it warmed up, I really noticed that dry, dusty peanut flavor people often associate with Bean products.   I don't know if I get anything from this I associate with country ham. Overall, good, but not the best Booker's I've had.

Good depth, slight burn, medium finish.

Nose is a bit disappointing. Honestly, not much there. I wasn't using a nosing glass though."
3.25,"Nose: Great nose, complex, sweet, caramel, leather, burnt honey? Needs some ice to melt down first. Similar to Blanton’s nose. 
Palate: burnt, almost charred brown sugar toast. Very Long spicy finish, not near as good as the nose though."
4.0,"Refreshing. It’s hefty, and the oak is prevalent. Not the same profile as the Kitchen Table I have. More of a classic bourbon with a twist. Thin base of caramel and vanilla, but most of what I get is a buttery, herbal, high-alcohol punch. Maybe some orange zest and cinnamon too."

4.5,"First ever Booker's! Couldn't wait to try this.

Nose is sweet with brown sugar, toffee, molasses, and vanilla, with some raspberry and peach showing a fruity side. Little coal smoke and shoe leather as well. 
Flavor is minty and peppery with vanilla and charred oak. 
Body is smooth, bit perhaps a little lacking for barrel proof. Leaves a nice prickly numbness on the tongue
I will definitely be seeking out Booker's whenever I can from now on"

4.25,"Sweet butterscotch & vanilla bomb on the nose.  Beautiful spice and cinnamon on the palate that carries over to a long, tingly finish.  With that said, there isn’t too much of a burn or Kentucky hug.  Finish remains primarily in the mouth and on the tongue.  Surprisingly smooth considering the substantial 124.7 proof.  Notes of oak on the backend.  Definitely one of my favorite bourbons."
4.0,Bottle has been open for 5 months now and opened up nicely. More flavor and less alcohol burn so I am upping my score.

5.0,"Wonderfully warm early, notes and nose  of brown sugar with slight brine...and almost NO burn, unbelievable for 124.7 proof!!  Been drinking bourbon for 20 years and this may be my favorite cask-strength bourbon I’ve had in my Glencairn glass.  
I use/rely on this app to venture off the Buffalo Trace/Weller lines...cheers to you all who taste and rate on the regular!"
5.0,"Stupid-good.  Loads of caramel up front, with prominent notes of cinnamon and allspice.  Thick body with a nice, understated brininess.  I don't quite get the peanut aspect others report.  Finish is deceptively smooth for 125 proof.  Buy it and hoard it."
4.25,"*Just revisited this after leaving it 2/3 full for a few months. Less peanut than last time. This is delicious. Smoother. Fuller. Light cinnamon notes, and I'm actually getting a brown sugar country ham glaze. A little smokey, a lot of umami for a whiskey. I understand where the name comes from!"

Woodier than most and lots of peanut brittle, slightly astringent on the palate, but definitely Bookers profile. Bitter finish, but tasty nonetheless."
3.25,"I am mainly a subjective “value” reviewer. I must take into account price when reviewing any whiskey. I believe most of us this do this anyway and to deny it wouldn’t be reflective of the majority. 

As in most things, when something is relatively expensive, hopes are high for the product. So I have no one to blame but myself for the expectations of this whiskey. Whiskey doesn’t follow you get what you pay for....it follows, “you pay for the ability to get it” - meaning the price is based on availability and not quality . The price, the clout, the story and the packaging over promise on this pour. Perhaps the experience will be better served with more time."

It's sweet but like brown sugar soaked in rubbing alcohol.  there's also a slight artificial sweetener note.  I'm glad that I finally opened this bottle and removed the myth that surrounded it.  Would I have liked beaten biscuits more? Maybe but I'm pretty sure it wouldn't live up to its hype either.  Nothing really does in the end"

4.0,"This is a well-rounded bourbon with light rye notes, red fruit, plenty of spice, some wood, and a nice almond backing (though not an incredibly strong one) that blends a tad into marzipan. Booker's Kitchen Table has more of an alcohol flavor and licorice, which brings out its own sweetness to be fair. This might have a little bit more youth to its flavor, but it also has added complexity with a nice almond richness that come sour more with water and leaves a nice finish. Booker's Shiny Barrel has a substantial amount of additional toffee with toasted almond and also some nice licorice that this can't catch up to. This is very good, but Shiny Barrel is better. This is different from Kitchen Table, bit the quality is comparable. It's a tough call between the two because although I like this's nutty sweetness, its younger more mineral and rye notes are a bit disappointing. Belle Meade Cask Strength is also right in the appropriate range and is suitably complex. I might actually place the Belle Meade a little above this, up with the Shiny Barrel."

4.0,"Color is a dark copper,  and swirling produces thick legs. 

Nose is maple, brown sugar, roasted peanuts, chocolate, red apples, cherries, tobacco, leather, and charred oak. For sure there's some heat at first, but it dissipates after some breathing time. 

Palate starts with rich/dark caramel, peanuts, and chocolate. There also some fruit I'm having a hard time identifying. Cinnamon and other baking spices arrive on the mid-palate and carry into the long finish along with brown sugar, vanilla and oak. There's a nice warm Kentucky hug, but it drinks below its proof.

I only have experience with Booker's batches going back to 2018 so I can't compare to the older stuff; but this is my favorite batch from those that I've tried. It's everything Booker's should be: big, bold, rich, and spicy."
5.0,"Ok Country ham 6 yrs 4mo 2 days. 124.7 proof as always unchill and no coloring. Poured neat/1drop nose is graham cracker, almond butter, dusty spice with some brown sugar and barrel woods.Sure there is some ethanol but it does not hinder.  Sewing machine oil mouthfeel brings palate of burnt sugars, and dark caramel. Hazelnut and chocolate along side seasoned oak and salted butter with (am I imagining) glazed ham?  Wonderful richness and depth of flavors. The proof is there but for me its still EASY drinking with heat a non issue. Understand I am a high proof bourbon lover so I may be less affected by proof/heat. Finish is nice and long with traditional fading salted caramel and drying barrel but has a nutty/malty note that I relish in the Booker's line.....99/100...... For me this is high end bourbon(haven't had elite high$$ product such as Pappys , GTS , craft releases or the like)   That being said I have had a lot of bourbon and can say that the Booker's line is my favorite along with OF1920, Knob Single barrel and Stagg Jr. Ill even throw in JD single barrel barrel proof just cause its that good. The common theme is proof. OF1920 is lowest at 115. IMO American whiskey(bourbon etc) needs high proof to bring out the intensity of flavors and depth unlike scotch which needs age to deliver the same level.  Bourbon lovers rejoice.....an available, affordable (somewhat) delicious whiskey. 
Gonna put this head to head with Shiny Barrel edition to compare"
4.5,"Did a blind tasting with 6 barrel proof whiskey's, Country Ham was the winner. Great flavor and the least amount of burn from the high proof tasting."
