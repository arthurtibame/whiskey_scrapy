3.5,"Appearance: This particular “whiskey” has a light straw color and thicker watery legs.

Nose: The nose is pretty and unique with rich notes of caramel, sugarcane, straw and hay, buttered sweet corn, dried banana chips, over ripe apple and peach, and tortilla chips. There’s also a floral quality as well as a young maltiness that’s hard to describe. But big picture - It’s great!

Taste: The palate overall is sweet with a slight astringency. Notes of carmel, lemon, and sugarcane namely, make themselves welcome.

Finish: The taste after the swallow drops from existence, but then a sweetness rises up one’s throat and lingers for a bit.

Thoughts: So, first a disclaimer. This spirit is made from aged white corn and sugarcane distillate, therefore it is not technically all “whiskey.” It’s more of a whiskey/rum hybrid. Even so, I find it very delicious and unique! This one is a special release made by Master Distiller, Victor Matthews for his friend, Sean Fitzgerald, owner of the award winning Wobbly Olive in Colorado Springs. I was given a bottle and have really enjoyed it! If you are around the area or somehow see it in the wild, I would definitely recommend giving it a try! Thanks, Victor! Cheers!"
