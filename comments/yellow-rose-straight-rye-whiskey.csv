2.5,"This is an average at best Rye. I was given a bottle of this by my family and after 2 weeks of trying this I can honestly say that every other Rye Whiskey I have in my bar is better than this and those include Bulleit Rye Sazerac, and Rittenhouse this all show and no go. Now, this is a harsh review but I was expecting at least above average whiskey. It does have a nice spicy nose but that is quickly replaced by a medicinal taste that lingers in your mouth. On the good side, it does make a good Old Fashion and a decent Manhattan but this is supposed a very good Rye and it is only good for mixing. I will return to this whiskey in about 3 weeks to see if the flavor has changed but right now at this price, I can not recommend this Rye to anyone. There are much better choices out there for a lot less money."
3.75,It’s not as spicy as it is minty. Very effervescent with some sweetness. Not bad for a rye and would be interested in trying it in an old fashioned or manhattan.
