Liquorice, TCP and iodine upfront, with a kick of funky peat.

It’s quite a sweet dram and initially numbs the palate.  It tastes slightly young, but that’s not a bad thing if you’re looking for the peat hit.

A drop of water brings more of the peat, but seems to dampen more of the subtle tastes instead of opening it out.  It finishes with a numbing salty maritime aftertaste which mellows to just leave the smoke and peat."
