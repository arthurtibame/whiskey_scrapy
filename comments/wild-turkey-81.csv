3.0,"Nose: A delicate woody presence with vanilla, corn syrup and honey notes. Some fruity and mild spice hints, a touch of mint and very subtle coconut. It's cask-driven but laid-back,  the oak being firm and noticeable but not brash. A very pretty nose. [The dry glass aroma is sawdust and leather].

Palate: Oily and sweet arrival. The development brings out spicy flashes of rye and confirms the cask-driven heart of this spirit. In the mid palate a prominent spearmint note comes forward supported by clove oil and cinnamon. A nice balanced texture.

Finish: Medium. Dry, but not sour, and mildly bitter (the bitterness of dark chocolate). The aftertaste is pleasantly sweet.

This is a gentle bourbon - once you get your head around that it all falls into place. Some whiskey is sweet, some spicy, some hot and intense, some powerful and grippy - this one is gentle with a cooling mint character throughout that is balanced by just a little warm spice.

The nose improves substantially once you let it stand and develop in the glass for 5 minutes - try it if you don't believe me. This one really blossoms and fills out with lots of rich honeyed wood spice notes.

It's a good combination of elements overall, and given the very reasonable price this whisky represents value for money. It is acceptable to sip neat (very pleasant and easy, in fact) and it's a very good mixer.  Just don't expect it to knock your socks off - that's not what it's all about.

""Above Average"" : 3 stars"

3.0,"Nose: The nose comparing side by side with the Wild Turkey 101 is really mild and welcoming. The bouquet is almost Jim Beamish (I do intend that as a compliment; I like Beam.) Caramel and vanilla predominate the nose with minor notes of peanut butter and honey filling in around it.
Taste: Once again, compared to the 101 this bourbon is smooth. It's much less punchy due to the lower alcohol content, which some may like and some may find boring. So yesterday, I grilled corn for my wife and I as part of our dinner, and that's a big note I'm getting here. I also find honey, black tea, oak wood, and there is a minty finish that leaves you feeling fresh and wanting another sip.
Opinion: This is a tasty daily sipper. And that minty finish I am really enjoying, and I can see this being a favorite budget dram for some people. Cheers!"

NOSE: General Sweetness. Toffee, Butterscotch, Vanilla, Slightly Floral with a Hint of Citrus. A touch of the Dry Dusty WT Funk. A hint of Oak.
NEAT: Not a lot of complexity which is a little surprising considering all the notes I am getting from the nose. Vanilla sweetness, a touch of Rye Spice, and a little oak. Finishes with minimal heat. Thinnish mouthfeel but coats the palate in lingering oak and pepper spice.
SPLASH:  A few drops of water brighten the nose, accentuating the Floral Note, but burying everything else. Takes away what little spiciness was on the palate, but does pull out a little more oak.
VERDICT: Nice. I find it a little on the light side and missing the heavy oak notes of the 101. Conversely, I find the 101 to be a bit heavy and needing air and dilution to hit my bourbon sweet spot. Maybe that's why I liked the Longbranch so much? It's almost like a blend of the two. However, this is very good and is probably (along with Four Roses) among my favorite 80 proofers."

2.25,"The original Wild Turkey is a telling example of how average an all-time classic straight bourbon can really be and why the word ""classic"" is a bit overestimated in terms of whiskey.
To the nose - chocolate, plum, fresh grass, a bit spiritous.
To the taste - smooth “straight” bourbon to the core with silky hints of caramel, spices and raisins.
Finish is unimpressive and very predictable.
Tbh I liked it in a manner and it's a decent drink so to say but I'd rather replace it with a less promoted but more remarkable bourbon since there's some in the market."

3.25,"My first bourbon since younger times with JD & coke.

L: Deep gold color with pale amber hues. Medium crest with large diffuse legs falling quite fast.

N: Vanilla, cream corn, cinnamon, rye bread, baking spices, overripe apples & pears, cooked white peaches. Faint vegetal notes reminiscent of Oolong tea & grass.

M: Full bodied, light sweetness, oily with soft tannins, a light tartness & a mellow burn. Similar flavors although bolder & fruitier.

O: Great first impression with this bourbon. I love the rye notes I pick up in this & the fact that the vanilla is not overwhelming."

That’s not to say there isn’t any flavor though. This has all the classic bourbon flavor in the world with baking spices, cherry, and a slightly Smokey aftertaste. Really quintessential bourbon at a great price."

2.5,"I have had the 101 Wild Turkey and i remember that one been a good dram, well this is not my kind of bourbon. Way too herbal, oaky and burning. 

Bottled at 40.5%abv

On the nose it has the typical bourbon notes but not as pleasant. Prunes. A Stinky bourbon note, Banana, Cinamon and vanilla.

On the palate is too herbal and unpleasant, for me. Caramel, Herbal Clove unpleasant. much too herbal. Very young oak. The finish is too cloying.

Overall i give this dram an 56 over 100. Some people might like it, not my case."

3.0,"11/2018........Had this on flight back to NH from Texas. Choices were this, JD and Dewars white...easy. This is the most flavorful 80proofer ive had. Dark caramel, cinnamon, toasty oak with WT spice. Its similar to WT101 but lacks the oily texture and extra flavor burst power. Still has good finish and is overall a very good bourbon imo. Problem is for a few$ more you can have the superior 101. If you can get it for a deal or prefer a lower proof than by all means this will hit the spot......81/100........Id buy it for around $15-18, any more go 101"
