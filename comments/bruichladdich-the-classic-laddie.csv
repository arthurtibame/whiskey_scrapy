3.75,Some vanilla but mostly fruits honey and malt. On warmer tastings the fruits shows up better with a cantaloupe and hint of mango. The pallet showcases a medium body with a sweet mouthfeel that ends in a bitter cigar ash however it is not a pleated whisky. It has a reasonable burn for 100 proof. Not a go to but a worth a try.

3.5,"Strong. Crisp. Green fruit from nose to finish. 
Nose: a bit to sharp from the high APV bottled at 50%. Incredibly aromatic with strong green fruit. Palate: is in attack mode as well but has a sweetness to it. Finish: long, fruity, almost bittersweet, slightly salty.

Not a passive drink but hits the spot. 

$17/pour, $51/bottle"
4.5,"I've gone through two bottles of this and it's simply amazing. I have to drive to another state just to find this whiskey and it's well worth the drive.

Nose - 5/5 Right up front you're bombarded with cereal notes (Apple jax) along with a deep and ritch campfire like  smoke (No peat), malted barley, peppermint, clove, bubblegum and finished with the most unbelievably satisfying alcohol burn I've ever endured. (Due to the 50% abv)

Palate - 5/5 surprisingly cereal and smoke notes carry over and I also get berries,pears,moss, molasses and mild tobacco and once again that 50% abv complements perfectly.

Price - 4/5 Ok, so this is where things become disappointing. at $60 I think it's overpriced for something so young and without an age statement on top of it being hard to find, or non-existent in Philadelphia it can become pricey to enjoy this dram.

Conclusion - buy it, drink it, stock it."

Not amazing but still that unique bruichladdichness about it which makes it enjoyable. I had it turned into a bramble cocktail at one point, this is a versatile dram that you shouldn't feel bad mixing here or there. Regular price around $60 CAD."

3.5,"Olfato: frutos cozidos (carambola ou pêras), menta, dulçor do malte, floral, costa marinha, baunilha, mel e notas cítricas agradáveis. Apesar do ABV alto o álcool não é agressivo.

Paladar: dulçor, floral, baunilha, apimentado, mel, oleosidade e costa marinha. Amargor presente mas que balanceia o dulçor deste whisky. Álcool presente mas não agressivo, apenas acentuando as notas de degustação.

Finalização: média para longa, malte, amargor e salinidade agradável.

Impressões gerais: não é um custo x benefício mas com um destilado muito bem feito. Se você quer experimentar um whisky de Isla, não defumado e sem muitas influências do carvalho este é um bom whisky, mas seu ABV de 50% pode impressionar alguns apreciadores inexperientes. Não é um whisky complexo mas que possui certa “riqueza” no aroma e paladar. Fácil de encontrar nos free-shops e indicado para aqueles que buscam provar um whisky peculiar, com o diferencial de ter sido produzido exclusivamente com malte escocês."

4.5,"Wanted to try a non peated Islay scotch. This has good reviews everywhere and was on sale. Poured neat, slow sticky legs. Nose has smoke, not hearty damp campfire smoke. More like a power saw caught in a fresh piece of kd lumber and smokes a little bit as the blade snags and burns the wood. Tea leaves, salted butter and dusty cardboard. There is malt and raw fresh honey as well. Quite a bit going on but its all very subtle which makes the sledgehammer to the palate surprising. Thick creamy mouthfeel brings a powerful surge of barley sweetness, luscious gooey beeswax, tree sap and smoke with white pepper that transitions to delicious pure malt flavor. Nose and palate are highly complex. Finish is long lasting malt, honey and bourbon like oaky/cinnamon/char dry fade. Carries nice warming heat at 100pf but nowhere near harsh. This is a very different profile. It strips away the fruit and peat and really delivers the malt. Its sweet and balanced with good smoke influence. In one word it is.... exquisite. Well worth the $50 I paid, I will explore other options from Bruichladdich for sure(They have a peated line as well). 96/100 ........This is pure scotch!!........... Awesome tip -You can go to their website(classic laddie page) and type in your bottle batch # and get all the info of what went into your vatting. Number of casks, vintage years, barrel type.....very impressive!!"

4.0,"Nose: Bright lemon honey, apricots, and a prairie full of wildflowers!  Orange marmalade and buttery malt take the stage, and wow this is fruity a beautiful!  Green pears and a little oaky spice appear the second time in.

Palate: A bit of surprising spicy kick up front.  Definitely malt forward with butter, biscuits, toffee brittle, and a small bit of soft apple.  More spice the next sip with cinnamon, oak, and ginger.  The malt turns to almost a sunflower seed nuttiness.

Finish: Medium length.  Butter and graham crackers along with some tart green apple that only shows up much later.  The malt fades into a subtle sweet smokiness.

Water does away with most of the fruity floral notes, replacing them with more creamy malt.  The spicy is dulled a bit, but elongated, stretching out into roiling waves of spice.  The sweetness in the finish dies, replaced with cinnamon, vanilla, and smokey oak.

Conclusion:  I have a soft spot for floral whiskies and the nose on this one definitely provides!  A nice, floral, fruity nose with a surprisingly spicy taste, I don't know if it's something to keep in stock, but I'll never say no to it!"

3.75,"This is one that I might revisit as I consume more.  I like the nose better than the palate, which is OK.  It's a fairly robust dram with more alcohol than I expected from the nose.   Although this is unpeated, there is a moderate smoke that tastes an awful lot like peat to me.  The smoke shows up very early in the palate.  Overall, the palate is nice, but lacking anything distinctive   The finish is long, with a slight bitterness.  

Overall, I'd say it's decent, not a buy for me.  But I'd still like to try it a couple more times to see is I pick up more on the palate."

3.75,"Part one of the Wee Laddie tasting set review. 

I bought the 3 bottle tasting set from Bruichladdich (which contains 200ml bottles of The Classic Laddie, Islay Barley, and Port Charlotte Scottish Barley) almost 3 years ago and figured it was time to dust it off and give it a proper shakedown. 

First up is The Classic Laddie. This Islay single malt is bottled at 50% ABV and is non chill filtered and natural color of yellow gold. It is also unpeated, a bit of an oddity for Islay, but everything under the Bruichladdich label is just that. 

The nose has very strong cereal notes, the barley is definitely the star here. Barley sugar and honey with a nice lemon/lime note. Floral at times with jasmine and honeysuckle, creamy vanilla and sugar cookies. Fruity, but not very sweet. Apricots, peaches, papaya, pears, oranges and very light sherry. Salty sea air, buttery almonds, oak and sawdust. There is a bit of burnt sugar and even a quick hit of coffee grounds. It’s definitely a young whisky with a youthful greenness and some vegetal notes. A mineral/chalky note at times, and even though it is unpeated, it has definite peat-like qualities to it. Hardly any alcohol to it even though it’s at 50%. 

The palate has plenty of honey, cereal malt and spice. Fruity, apricots, peaches, pears and orange pith. Vanilla, sugar cookies and salty sea spray. Charred oak, peppery and very young tasting. Again, those unpeated peat notes come in and serve to confuse but also elevate this malt a bit. Not a complex palate, but the quality is evident. 

A medium bodied mouthfeel that is very creamy and mouthwatering. 
The finish is medium long, malty, grainy, vanilla, oak and dry. 

Some nice complexity on the nose, but still could be improved with additional maturation or possibly a finish in some first fill bourbon barrels. The palate leaves much to be desired in the complexity department, however. I’m still amazed thought that this is unpeated. I would have figured at least 2-5ppm. Not sure what it was that I was getting if not peat. Easy drinking considering the strength, but not one that I would likely return to as it’s just not my preferred style. 3.75

3.75,"This is not your normal bruichladdich whisky as it state it's U peated which is very uncommon from islay region.
Beautiful floral note right in the middle, it's very similar to Jasmine or Chinese violey. Then you have your sugary, toffee ish lightly spread around the flower. Not those heavy bourbon sugary notes though. You can also get those spicy notes from the American oak from the bottom of your flower.
After you take a sip, a gentle feed to your soul as you try to explore those wonderful floral and sugary notes then suddenly you feel this heat along with some American oak spice notes trample straight into your core.
It's actually not a bad feeling, and for those who had any cask strength whisky this is about 50% weaker.

If you like the ""tiffany blue"" bottle or want to try out slightly different whisky from Bruichladdich. This is for you."
4.25,"This is a re-taste.

Nose: Soft, fragrant cereal with a generous, buxom honeyed personality. Apricot nectar, ripe peaches, vanilla flowers, melon, musk oil, night-blooming jasmine and delicate red wine notes.  There's the faintest possible suggestion of smoke and a hint of briny sea-breeze in the background as well. As it rests in the glass and warms, a buttery malt aroma arises.

Palate: Sweet honeyed cereal, like a compelling breakfast bowl of rice flakes, honey, sweet yoghurt and fresh ripe dark figs. Mild baking spices, but very subdued (spice biscuits warm from the oven and cooling on the table). There's a hint of apple, but primarily this whisky is a platform for cereal goodness to show its charms. The texture is creamy and lip-smacking.

Finish: Medium. Genteel, sweet and cereal, with a note of mead and Côtes du Rhône red.

I strongly recommend adding about half a teaspoon of water to an ounce of this whisky. That (to me anyway) is the magic proportion that allows it to sing in full voice.

This tasting is based on a bottle from batch L/161142, recipe 17/092, bottled on 26 April 2017 and comprising spirit derived from the fermentation of Scottish mainland barley matured in a combination of ex-bourbon barrels, PX sherry butts, Spanish Ribera del Duergo 1st fill hogheads and French Rhone 2nd fill hogsheads. I adore and commend Bruichladdich for their full-throttle geekiness in making batch recipe information available to customers.

I'm also convinced that this whisky has improved by an order of magnitude over the last decade.

The last time I rated it here was immediately after a Bruichladdich tasting night where it was the first dram in a flight that included some seriously impressive whiskies. In that context it rated well, but was overshadowed by the powerful presence of Port Charlotte and Octomore drams. 

Tasting it tonight however, in isolation and in a relaxed setting, it performs much more expressively and can be appreciated for the fine and often unsung whisky that it is.  I'm almost of the opinion that this should never be tasted in the presence of other Bruichladdich expressions. It is warm, comforting, delicious, gentle and honest, but all too easy to upstage.

The seductive enthusiasm of this malt is irresistible, the distillery character being free of the distractions of  braggadocio sherry or raunchy peat.  This is the pure fragrant nymph that is Bruichladdich, naked other than for a gauzy robe of wine. To top it off, it's even reasonably priced.  If you have not tasted this lovely dram for a while I urge you to take another look. Highly recommended.

5.0,"The island of Islay continues to amaze me with its diverse offerings, and The Classic Laddie is one of its best. One of the really cool things that Bruichladdich does, is give you access to the exact recipe used for your batch of scotch. My batch (19/039) contained 12 different types of casks aged between eight and eleven years. Every cask contained Scottish barley and was on its first or second fill. If you're wondering why the bottle is turquoise, apparently it was colored after the sea near the distillery on sunny days.

The sea has more impact on this whisky than just the bottle though, as you can pick up hints of sea water on the nose. You will have to search for them though, as the nose is heavy and complex with many aromas. After the initial ethanol vapors, you can find sugar cookies, sweet fruits, flowers, spearmint, gingerbread, cream, and butter. You can really sit and enjoy the nose on this whisky for several minutes and continue to find more flavors.

The palate is very sweet but the 50% ABV whisky started to slightly numb my tongue. After adding some water, I started to get more flavors like sweet corn, honey, and sweet oak. The finish is long and complex. It starts with a bitter note of dark chocolate but becomes lighter with some honey and pepper. After lingering for a bit, some floral and toffee flavors begin to reveal themselves.

Wow, this scotch is really quite an experience. I really admire the distillery's transparency about what is in their bottle and wish more companies would follow their lead. Considering that, along with the rich complex flavors, high alcohol content, and affordable price, this scotch is an easy five stars from me."

Coincidentally, I'd just returned from a visit to Edinburgh that featured a side trip to tour the Deanston distillery, not far from the city.  I never got to the Highlands or Islands, but I'm hopeful that some day not too far off, I may get to do that.  For the past year or two, this 71-year old, former hippie has joyfully discovered the pleasures and sensual attractiveness of single malt whisky.  I've begun to sample offerings from the different regions, and even my unsophisticated nose/palate/brain can appreciate the subtle differences and remarkable qualities of this wonderful creation.  Anyway, after having acquired a handful or two of 'entry level' whiskies (i.e., those costing less than $60), I just had to try 'the Laddie', and see for myself what Jim was talking about.  All I can say is ""WOW!"".  Bruichladdich Blue Bottle is now my 'gold standard'.  Can't wait to compare it to other single malt offerings; but for now.....I have nothing but praise for the smooth, delicate, and amazingly gentle punch this distillate offers.

4.25,"I’m a big Bourbon fan but decided to watch a Scotch documentary on a plane. This particular doc had a lot of background info on this distillery, so I caved into the power of suggestion and bought this bottle.

The nose has vanilla, juicy pears, malt and a little peppery.  You’d swear there was some peat in there. There’s a little bit of the classic scotch band-aids smell, I haven’t figured out what else to call it yet.

The palate has an oily mouthfeel. It’s briney with some spicy peppery notes, light fruit and vanilla.

The finish is long with an initial burn in the top of the throat and comes through the back of the nostrils. It has lingering vanilla, malt, band-aids.

This is fantastic. I am a big Bourbon fan and don’t have nearly as much experience with Scotch, but this one is up there as one of my faves."

4.0,"Trying some Bruichladdich Classic Laddie and man, those people know what they are doing!
On the nose it smells a lot of honey and sweet bright notes.
The mouthfeel is viscous and yummy, I get a briney almost meaty taste mixed with great sweetness turning into spicy prickling on the tongue. You wouldn't guess this is at 50% ABV.
Aftertaste is long, sweet and spicy and lip smackingly good!

Edit: Lowering the score a bit, the last third of the bottle was not as enjoyable."

3.75,"Just picked up a new bottle, always great to have on hand in the cabinet.

50% Abv, with pleasant subtle burn as it rest on the tongue and tails off.

Very pleasant as neat. A few drops of water (but not too much) expands the flavor a bit.

Bright with Apples, Vanilla, Citrus, and a slight brine and botanicals as you absorb the taste and smell.

No smoke or peat, this is a light - medium whiskey for me. But if Caol Isla, Lagavulin, Laphroaig, aren't frequent for you, then maybe you'll pick up those hints."

4.0,Everything I want to like in a Lagavullin but can’t because I am not yet a big peat fan. This is a great compromise between Islay and Speyside. Cannot wait to get further into the bottle.

4.5,"This one’s a real unique beast. 

The batch code on my bottle reveals a blend of 7-10 year old malts aged in bourbon and wine casks. 

The nose is unmistakably Islay, but is missing those characteristic phenol notes that result from peat usage. It still smells quite briny and smoky with hints of fruity sweetness. 

I’m greeted with a burst of rich flavor on my tongue receptors when I taste this whisky. It sort of glides around my mouth hole and triggers all of my flavor detectors in a rather pleasant way. Again, it’s definitely an Islay, and the lack of peat doesn’t change that at all. 

The finish is long and nuanced. Some savory smoke notes and dark fruit notes linger for a moment before leaving an ethereal film of rugged seaside flavors. 

This is a solid bottle for the value. I’ll admit that I was skeptical of this young and unconventional single malt, but Jim McEwan definitely knew what he was doing. This is definitive proof that there’s a whole lot more to Islay than just peat."

3.25,"Review is a compilation throughout the life of the bottle. Was always tasted in a Glencairn, sometimes with small amounts of water. 
Cereal grains, caramel, and toffee on the nose with some type of fruit and a little sea air. Palate is like a salted caramel cakey dessert thing with a touch of smoke or maybe just crispy baked corners. The palate has a touch of smoke toward the middle along with salt. (I know it’s not peated). A little bitter and rubbery toward the end. Long finish with seaweed and a sort of tartness. Really benefits from sitting for about 20 mins. Wasn’t too stoked on it at first but it started to grow on me. Still wouldn’t buy again at $57."

3.5,"3.5 score but feels like a lot less. A 50%abv expression of an Islay malt, UNPEATED. Except for ardmore (a highland peated malt) i am not fond of those types of experiments, if i buy islay i expect peat. The bottle is arguably beautiful, some hate it, some love it, it looks like a shampoo container. Pale straw color. 

On the nose: women makeup. That creamy makeup women use to hide dimples.

Wet rice, in the rice maker. Chinese rice candy. Butter. Wet grass. In some ways similar to a single grain but powerful.
Interesting, Different, Creamy. 

The palate is where everything goes south. Spice bomb. Wasabi. Pepper bomb. Hot very hot, Sulphuric. Orange peel hints. mposible to enjoy due to the excesive spicyness. Its a 50%abv i'll drop water on it. Finish with ginger spice, mouth numbing. 

With water: gets worse. Nose almost dissapear. Lemon new note.
Water kills palate feels like gas water and some spice. 

Overall i give it a 74 and it is due to an interesting nose, that i have never had before. Not my cup of tea."

4.0,"Smooth, sweet, and well-rounded. This is a lot like Oban 14. The sweetness is backed by minerals before some wood and a hint of tartness comes through on the finish. There is some nuttiness hanging out here that agrees with the vanilla. One can also find a bit of that orange flavor that characterizes some of the best whiskies hiding in here. It's about on par with Oban 14, but for just a bit more one can get the Springbank 10, which is just that bit better. There is a lot of depth here, but not a ton of variation throughout. It's good and I would happily sip it, but it's main appeal comes from its interesting elements for connoisseurs rather than from a delicious flavor or punchy variation."
4.0,"A wonderful, unique scotch. I think it's the barley that distinguishes it from the rest. Along with that, lots of nice flavors, a rich creamy feel, and a welcoming 100 proof touch to finish it off. Whether you go back for a second purchase depends on your taste, but you at least have to try this."
4.0,"Pleasant, easy-drinking unpeated malt. Very light in color, reminds you of the barley it comes from. Adam Hannett describes it as a good “breakfast whisky” which I think is surprisingly accurate. 

Nose is very light, smelling a bit of the barley itself. On the palate it’s sweet – a fair amount of vanilla, with some apple, honey, and a bit of minerality. As you approach the finish you get stone fruits like apricot and a bit of peach. Long finish as the flavor lingers quite a while."

Finish:
Sea Brine. Cigar Tobacco lingers with a Honey Dew Melon, Dry Leather Oils and Campfire Smoke brings back Toasted Marshmallows."
4.5,"From the distillery that makes the most heavily peated Scotch in the world comes this beautifully delightful UNpeated Islay Scotch.  ""Unpeated"" and ""Islay"" are two words you don't expect to see together...ever.  When you think Islay you think heavily peated whiskies.  However, you will NOT be disappointed by this Scotch because everything else that is unique to Islay is still very much there.  It has the beautiful blend of saltiness and fruitiness that usually come second to peat, but come first in this.  It does have a lot of butterscotch that is usually seen in highlands, but can still appear semi-frequently in Islay Scotches.  I've seen a few people taste this and be convinced it's peated.  So, this could be a great learning whisky to separate all of the great qualities in an Islay whisky."
