4.0,"Nose has an immediately scent of peat, but also a note of burned caramel and perhaps an ever so slight hint of banana. 

The first sip is at very first moment sweet-ish with taste of plum and peat. It evolves past the sweetness and delves deeper into the peaty flavor as you swallow. Aftertaste also slowly evolves later and leaves a taste that reminds me a bit of slightly underripe nuts. A somewhat surprisingly gentle taste considering an otherwise strong nose.

A bit of water brings out the scent of caramel and sweet fruits by softening the peat. The water seemed to dull the flavor and bring out the taste of the spirits, so cannot recommend that. 

Conclusion: Rather easy going taste, yet a very interesting and complex palate despite the easy going smell. A good whisky for a calm and relaxing evening during a warm summer!"

4.0,Purchased at the Iceland duty free. We pull this out after bbqs a lot. It's a favorite of several friends of mine now.
