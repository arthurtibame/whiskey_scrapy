3.0,"This Tullibardine is very new and I got a sample from Whisky.com who apparently is the only one actually having this in stock. It isn’t even on the official website of Tullibardine. Might be some kind of field test - who knows. 

On the nose it welcomes you with some fresh stone-fruits predominantly cherries and plums picked right from the tree. You also get some fresh damp hay and a bid of fermented apple. You definitely get a hint of sherry there as well. 

The palate offers chocolate with red berries which is surprisingly creamy. 

The finish stays for a long time and lingers about with a slight oaky bitterness and sour apple juice. 

It was enjoyable but makes you wonder why they would release an in-between whisky like this. All it really does for me is making me curious about the older ones which I expect to give me more richness and brinyness, which I was missing a bid here."
