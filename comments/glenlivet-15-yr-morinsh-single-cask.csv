4.0,"Definitely a game of two halves with these Glenlivet single casks. The Torrain is definitely no 1, this one doesn't reach the same heights but still a solid if over priced dram. Whilst the Perth and Tom An Uird didn't make much of an impression the Torrain and this dram were a step up. The aftertaste of the first two was faint the Torrain quite long a powerful...this is strong but rough. Water tamed it but I then I overdid it so definitely one which needs a precise touch on the aqua."
