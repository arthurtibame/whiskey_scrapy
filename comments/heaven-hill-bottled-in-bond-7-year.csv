3.5,Strong Carmel and creamy. Delicious neat
4.25,"N: Vanilla, caramel, orange, and spice. Some orchard fruit notes. Slightly woodsy. Very rich.

P: Sweet and spicy. Caramel, pear, apple pie. Anise and/or black licorice spice from start to finish. Orange hits the edges of the mouth. Slight bitterness, not unpleasant. Smooth, but assertive. 

Excellent dram, decent value sub-$50."
3.5,"Aroma is easy and warm, almost light, and comes through complex and multi-faceted ranging from sweet to spicy to earthy tones – I really enjoy the way it smells; Palate is like a muted more tannic and acidic version of what happens on the aroma and feels a tad… flat, especially compared to the aroma; Finish is pleasant and the harsher notes fade leaving a nice warm bourbon profile."
3.0,"I liked it and would do again. Sweet, nice finish. Balanced curve over the taste pallet."
4.0,This one is slowly gaining my favor. Delicate and almost scotch-like.
4.5,"The nose is sweet with baked pecan, brown sugar, caramel, vanilla, oak, fresh bread and the slightest hint of cherry. The palate is semi dry and rich and full of baking spices, baked pecan, brown sugar, caramel and vanilla. The finish is long and cinnamon spicey with fading pecan, brown sugar, caramel and vanilla."

Nose: sweet corn, vanilla, toffee. Overall, pleasant. 

Taste: nice mouthfeel, sweet, little bit of pepper in the back. Not much tannin

Finish: long, fairly smooth given the proof."

3.25,"Taste: 1.5 oz neat in mini-glen cairn

Nose (3.25): Vanilla and pecans with a bit of creamed corn.  There is also a bit of acetone/nail polish remover note that flaws the nose a bit.  It is not completely off putting but it is the achille's heel here.

Palate (3.5):  Palate is loads of vanilla and raw pecans giving way to pecan pie.  The palate is better than the nose.  Spice rushes in on the back end and it gets a little bit hot.

Finish (3.25): Caramel and vanilla with a bit of cinnamon.  The finish is lingering with some ethanol to dry things out.

Overall:  Average to above average pour here.  The vanilla and pecan is really good, but the nail polish remover on the nose, and that last pop of ethanol on the finish I wish wasn't there.  It flaws what would really be a ratjer enjoyable bourbon.

Is it better than the old 6yr old bottle....unequivocably yes.  Is it a better value.....not really.  I think the price increase cancels out the extra year.  The old 6 yr bottle-- cheaper but definately thinner and less dimensional.  New 7 yr. BiB-  more flavor, richer, but twice as much.  Not a bad bottle, but no need to hunt it."

4.0,"I should point out that I've tried this.  In more ways than one actually.  First I tried a sample of the old 6 year that dthom picked up in Kentucky.  Secondly I tried the new 7 year at Whiskyfest SF but...it was something like taste #15.  I think I liked it but my memories at that point are kind of fuzzy.

Nose: Interesting and complex.  Vanilla, dark caramelized sugars, dates and figs, malted milk balls with the emphasis on milk chocolate, some yeasty bread notes.

Flavor: Sweet vanilla crème brulee up front, very buttery for a 7 year age stated product, toasted coconut as well.  A little bit of that signature Heaven Hill roasted peanut.

Finish:  Medium length, a little spicy with a ton of baking spices HEAVY on the clove with lingering cinnamon and cardamom.  A little bit of oak on the finish but not overwhelming.  

Overall this is a very nice whiskey.  An easy sipper but not super simple with enough complexity that I wouldn't get fatigued on glass number 2.

And for those of you who are thinking or saying it: Yes I realize that you used to be able to get this in Kentucky for $15.  I've tasted the 6 year and it was nice.  This is better.  $25 better?  Maybe not.  You know what?  I don't live anywhere near the mythical land of Kentucky where fairies float in the air farting out magical whiskey dust.  So I like this as it is without comparison to the old product that you can't get anywhere anyways.  But seriously Kentucky don't ever change.  OK...maybe change a little by meeting demand with supply.  That is all."

3.5,"Day 4 of my bourbon advent calendar

Nose: It has a much sweeter nose than its discontinued counterpart. A lot more brown sugar, and toasted peanuts, with minimal oak. Very pleasant smell.

Plate: This bourbon doesn't really surprise me with the taste. It's exactly what i thought it was going to be, and it's just a classic bourbon, with notes of vanilla, oak, and a slight nuttyness

Considering the price I paid for this bottle I could drink this everyday, but I think I got lucky, because when I went back it was $12 higher than when I bought it. But it's still a decent pour for $45."

Medium complexity.

I would rather this be aged another 2 or 3 years like Henry McKenna to get the stars higher.

Update: After a few drops of water, opened up a bit and had a real buttery taste to it.

Going to stick to a 3.75 until I drink a few more drams of this. I think this might jump up to a 4. TBD"

3.5,"The nose has sweet corn, vanilla, rye, caramel, light baking spices with fresh rolls and a light grassy note.

The palate is lightly oily, sweet corn, vanilla, light spices grassy rye and  oak.

The finish is long with vanilla and sweet corn lingering on the back sides of the palate.

I’ve had the 6yr green label (90 proof) and this one is definitely an improvement. It’s more rounded and mellowed. But whether it’s worth the $25 increase, is up for debate."

3.25,"Peanuts on the nose along with a pleasant sweetness.  Nuts continue on the palate.  Oily and smooth.  Medium finish.  Actually tasted this blindly in a flight along with Angel’s Envy and E.H. Taylor and it finished last.  Did not enjoy the finish very much at the time.  With that said, this is a very solid pour.  I still get some of the notes that placed it poorly in the blind tasting, but they don’t strike me as offensive when standing alone."

3.5,"Like neat and with water

Nose: sweet corn, caramel
Taste: clove, caramel, slightly warm body, taste mellower with water but harsher finish"
4.25,"Nose: not getting a lot of nose.  Very faint vanilla and oak.  Very surprising considering it’s a 100 proof. 

Palate: bold flavors which are surprising based on nose.  I get “peppery peanuts” with a bit of chocolate and honey at the end.  Buttery texture 

Finish:  possibly one of the strongest finishes I’ve ever had in a bourbon.  Finish is medium to long and full of above flavors, especially peanut.  

Overall:  An amazing pour at $40 a bottle.  With that being said, I never tried the former 6 year old HH BiB which sold for less than half.   I’ve heard it was as amazing and adding a year was more about marketing to add to the bottom line, but just like McKenna, I will happily pay $40 for a bottle of this quality."

3.75,"First thoughts... 
Color: Mahogany to dark walnut

Nose: Honey Nut Cherries, peanut butter, clove. Strong on the first 2 scents. 

Taste: (allowed 10 min to open) Cinnamon, immediate hug, oak, brown sugar, little molasses. Maybe a werther's candy with the caramel. 

Second and 3rd sips: More oak. Lots of sugar. Some rye notes coming through. Great hugs each sip. Loosing some of the other flavors in first sip. 

Texture: Oily. Coats the mouth well.

Finish: Short to Medium. Loving the chest feel. 

Result: Easy sipper. Would be decent to introduce a newer appreciator to whiskey. Would compete with Knob Creek 100. I would buy again in the lower 30's. Nothing over $40 at all. At $41, I would pass. I think that extra year in the barrel brings out more oak for sure. Not a bad thing IMO. 

Distiller Rating: 3.75/5."

4.0,"First time having this one. Enjoying neat

Nose - vanilla and sweet notes with a very light alcohol smell. Pretty typical nose to most bourbons 

Taste - light and oily on the tongue. Vanilla and sweet to start like a lot of bourbons usually are. I also get a light nutty taste and an oak flavor that blends nicely with the vanilla and sweet taste. A little bit of spice at the end but not overbearing. 

Overall and value - this has been a bottle I have really wanted to purchase and finally found one for the right price. The nose is typical of bourbon and nothing fancy, the taste is complex and really good. Pricing and availability are my issue with this one. Seen from $35-$89 and rather hard to find. If you are able to grab this one for around 50 or under I recommend it. Great add to any collection and makes a great neat pour."
3.5,"The strong oak and nut blast you get right away would normally seem overpowering but as the 100 proof shows itself those flavors help balance it out. There is still a bit of that alcohol finish at the end so if you don’t like that you may want to stay way. Overall I loved this one but at $45 it may be a little overpriced depending on what you like. That being said,out of the bottle in bond bourbons available under $50, it’s probably the best one."

4.0,"I was a big fan of the bargain basement 6 year white label and the 7 year is a significant improvement. 

Is it worth several times as much for an extra year and a prettier bottle? I’d say so...it still blows away most of its competitors in that price range."
3.5,"BACKGROUND:  For many years, Heaven Hill Distillery produced a white-label, bottled-in-bond bourbon that was aged six years and sold only in the state of Kentucky.  Because of its quality and roughly $12 per bottle price tag, it was much loved and received a cult status among bourbon aficionados.

As a result, many were shocked and disappointed when Heaven Hill announced in 2018 that it was discontinuing the beloved bottled-in-bond.  Bourbon enthusiasts hoarded and stockpiled bottles, and its value skyrocketed on the secondary market.

Just one year, later though, Heaven Hill also announced that it was coming to market with a substitute bottled-in-bond offering.  Aged seven years rather than six and widely available rather than Kentucky-only, the new Heaven Hill BIB also carried a much heftier price tag and retailed around $40 rather than $12.

Despite its higher cost, curiosity seekers snapped up bottles as they appeared on shelves, and in many areas the updated Heaven Hill BIB has achieved a bit of scarce, allocated status.

Made with a mash bill of 78% corn, 12% rye, and 10% barley, Whisky Advocate magazine ranked the new offering at number four on its list of “Best Whiskies of 2019.” 

NOSE: In a Glencairn, an acetone/ethanol scent makes it difficult to discern any competing notes.  After switching to a Norlan glass, which helps mask the alcohol, some corn notes and nuttiness were present.  There was absolutely no hint of vanilla or caramel, which is odd since almost all bourbon noses contain at least a trace of those characteristics.

PALATE: The sweet corn and nuttiness that is present on the nose become significantly more prominent on the palate to the point that all other distinguishable flavors are excluded.  It is a very sweet and pleasant bourbon, but not too terribly complex by any measure.

FINISH: The finish brings a suprising heat, much like “Da Bomb” sauce on the “Hot Ones” YouTube show.  It is a long finish that just keeps going.  Cinnamon and mint notes that develop on the finish mimic the flavors of Big Red chewing gum.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: The Heaven Hill 7-Year Bottled-In-Bond is a bit of a one note wonder in flavor, but the one note is well done. 

Though I have never sampled the previous 6-Year offering, I can understand why it was so popular given its amazingly affordable price.  At around $40, though, the 7-Year version seems just a tad bit overpriced.

It is a perfectly fine bourbon, but not the first one I would grab off of my shelf even among daily sippers.

I struggle to understand why Whisky Advocate magazine awarded it 92 points and rated it so highly on its 2019 “Best of…” list."
