4.0,"Big fan of this whiskey, especially chilled. A nose with honey and citrus. Light taste that is sweet and smooth. I've never had a whiskey from Georgia but I am a fan of this one. Great bottle too! Nice small batch whiskey."
4.0,Its straight forward bourbon! I love when distillers just make moonshine and age it in barrells! Good stuff

3.5,"Not bad! There's a lasting burn but the flavor is pretty good. For a reasonable cheap ""bourbon"" it's a respectable choice"

4.5,"Stronger than your average bear. The best part is the heat that last 4 seconds longer than most giving all the flavors time to ""cook"". Exhale through the nose with your mouth slightly open and wow. I'm still picking out individual flavors. It's growing on me to be a top ten. Well done for a small distillery."
