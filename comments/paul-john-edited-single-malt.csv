4.0,"For sure this is a very good, affordable single malt. Adding water is good and helps unleashing hidden tastes of Indian spices. Very interesting experience. And I am really looking forward to see Paul John's liquors getting older and mature. This however is a very promising start. (app 130PLN - promo)"

3.0,"I tried the four core Paul Johns tonight at the Astor Center Whisky Spectacular and found them all thoroughly solid if unspectacular. The peated versions were the best and warrant a 3.5. This one was my favorite, narrowly edging the more heavily peated cask strength version."

2.0,"Ok number 3 on my JP journey. I love my peat. I'm a lagavullin and laphroaig man through and through. Maybe they shouldn't have poured me a classic 55% before hand but not a fan. Weird peat taste, bit of salt. Not much else"
4.0,"For the price, even its NAS (estimate 2-3 year old) it's great! Slightly peated, smooth and simple whisky to enjoy everyday. Love it!"
5.0,"This whisky is a real treat: chocolate-mint notes, nuts, herbs, luxuriant creaminess, a beautiful oily texture that Amrut lacks, an elegant marriage of peat and spice and a subtle drop of dryness at the end. Not to mention a few fruity notes throughout (although I can't quite pin them down... cherry, maybe kiwi too?).

This whisky is similar to Islay, but the peat style is different, more perfumed like Japanese peat and fruitier like French peat. The oily texture echos the fast aging, evoking the texture of Kavalan or P&M Corsican whisky. But otherwise, this website's review is pretty accurate."

3.5,"Subdued peat, strong, lingering spices on the tongue. Briny aroma that is almost non-existent in taste. Super long tongue spices that compound with each sip."

4.0,"Nov 2019.
Clear medium gold.
Small tulip.
Aromatic old furniture, leather, smoked cherrywood, wood fired bbq, toasted nuts, dark chocolate, and gram masala spicy in nose.
Full body with oak, old leather, toasted pecan, gentle smoked campfire wood, dried herb and tiramisu in palate.
Good balance medium long finish.
Like a old wise gentleman sit by the lake fishing."

3.0,Starts nice and gets better as it opens. Aroma starts a bit raw but as it opens more orchard notes arrive to pair with the light peat; Palate is a warm smoky fruity sip that’s velvety soft; Finish fades out smoky with a touch of spice.

4.0,"Subtle peat, doesn’t overpower the flavor, also sweet"
4.25,"Nose- initial hit of light camp smoke, which fades to reveal a dried fruit sweetness and raisins.  

Palate - peppery and full, spicy with dry tannins.  Subtle peat comes through in the end followed by a suspended pleasant bitterness

Finish - long, lingering with some peat with residual bitterness that is far from unpleasant.

Overall a delicious balanced single malt with just the right amount of peat and smoke."
4.75,Great mix of peaty scotch and bourbon flavor.
