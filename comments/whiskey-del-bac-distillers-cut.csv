4.0,"Went to a Del Bac tasting tonight with their brand ambassador. Tried several of their expressions and I can say that each of their expressions has a unique flavor profile. 

The version I got to taste tonight was a Madeira finish, which reminded me of a cross between Glendronach and Colkegan. Great stuff! Sherry finish meets mesquite smoke."
3.75,"This is intense.  So hot I needed water to enjoy and l rarely can say that.  That being said, neat I found it to be nutty, earthy, spicy and complex.  After a splash of water it unravels a bit and allows vanilla, peppermint and other goodies to tumble out.  This is a tough one.  I almost think the proof needs to be dropped slightly or it needs a bit more aging. This is good but it has potential to be so much more."
4.5,"Batch 17-02. Excellent stuff, much better than the standard releases as they only use a little if the smoked spirit. Seems too sweet at first but then opens up a lot with a rich mix of flavors."
2.75,"This distillery has a lot of hype in AZ and I have had a lot of my friends recommend it. Since I have now some experience with American single malts I felt ready to give this one a try. This particular Barrel clocked in at 121.5% proof and this was a private Barrel pick made by this restaurant. 
On the pallette you get caramel and candied almonds with a hint of spice. Mid pallette is more of the same with fruit and brown sugar notes appearing on the medium finish. Its oily and pretty easy to drink considering the proof 
It's not particularly complex and you can taste the youth. More years in the barrel would probably do wonders to this whiskey but as is it's nothing overly special. For the $69 this one goes for, it's tough to swallow. To be honest, even at $14 a pour it's tough to swallow. This is a great example of a promising craft distillery, just need to give their stock some more time to mature.
Cheers All!"
4.0,Batch 17-2 is deceptively delicious.
5.0,Batch 2: Rich raisin and balanced sweetness. Like a tempered Macallan with being over-sherried. From my understanding batch 2 is a Maidera cask.
