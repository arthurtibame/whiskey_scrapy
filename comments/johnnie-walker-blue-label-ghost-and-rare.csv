5.0,Very smooth and subtle. So sweet on the nose. Nose has hints of honey and maple syrup also with pineapple. Mouth flavors contain hazelnuts and chocolate. Also a light peat smoke. Caramel and lemon.  Very sweet on the mouth. A little vanilla and brown sugar sweetness on the finish.

4.5,"I've never had a particular interest in Johnnie Walker, and have never felt inspired to explore beyond some less than compelling entry-level JW bottles, specifically, the Red, Black, and White Walker offerings.  But I was excited to receive a sample of the Ghost and Rare Brora, courtesy of @pbmichiganwolverine. 

Not only is this well-aged (the primary component is whisky from the Brora distillery, which closed in 1983), but there's something almost mythical to drinking whisky that's a relic from a bygone age, sourced from a distillery that was boarded up years ago.  Diageo is apparently re-opening Brora later this year, which will dampen the Brora mystique in my mind.  But perhaps we'll get some great new whisky.

The whisky itself was not a letdown.   I found the nose to be very complex - sweet, fruity, and nutty, with multiple notes of each.  The palate was complex as well.  I will often say that a good blended whisky is well integrated.  In this case, I found the palate to be layered.  The top layer was spice, some wood and some heat.  The bottom layer was creamy grain and sweetness.  I've sometimes found drams that have this type of split presentation to be a bit off-putting, but in this case it works wonderfully.

I often consume samples in two sittings - half one day and half the next, and it's not uncommon that I find something new or different on the second day.  In this case, the nose and palate remained the same through both tastings, but the finish had a notable shift.  On the first tasting, the notes on the palate quickly disappeared, transitioning to dry, woody and slightly bitter flavors.  Not enough to ruin the experience, but not totally agreeable.  On the second night, the top spicy layer made the same quick exit, but the sweet layer remained as the drier, more bitter notes emerged.  It was enough to balance the finish quite nicely.

All in all, quite excellent!  Johnnie Walker will always be a producer of outrageous amounts of mass-market whiskies that I'll continue to pass over, but it's nice to see what the brand and Master Blender Jim Beverage are capable of. 

Thanks @pbmichiganwolverine for a great dram and a cool ghost distillery experience!"
4.25,"It’s been a good deal of time since I actually sat and tasted.  Holidays, sickness (head cold), and social obligations all out things on hold for a while.  So, this is a perfect pour to start the New Year from a tasting perspective.  Truly a rare treat that I will not delay to taste. 

It only begins to come alive after at least ten minutes.  Prior to, it flat and unexpressive.  As it awakens, tropical aromas of pineapples and toasted coconut.  Orchard fruits develop into the mix; over-ripened, pealed apples and pears with dashes of vanilla, caramel, confectionery sugar and cinnamon.  A bit of honey and lemoned tea forges through after significant time.  These aromas slowly build and crescendo and the collective creates a full symphony of notes. 

Sweet arrival, but not overly so, in a soft, velvety textured, medium weighted body.  Oak spices, tropical sweetness with hazelnuts and chocolate (think Nutella).  Sweet tea, honey, lemon, 

The palate is left with with the sweet tea with touch of wood spice and some oak tannins, bittersweet chocolate and ginger.  Which lasts a medium length of time. 

As I kept joyfully working through all parts of this pour, balance kept spring to minds. The volume of aromas, balanced.  The flavors on the palate, though not as vast as the nose (or I just could not acutely define them and missed out), was balanced.   The finish is where I selfishly wanted more and is where the weakness of the dram lies.  A bit of water improves the dram and is recommended.  Quite enjoyable, easy to take in. This whisky has a gravity about it that can slow time.  A million thanks to @PBMichiganWolverine for graciously sharing.  [92/100][Tasted: 1/25/20]"
4.5,"This what the regular JW Blue wishes itself to be.  Add a few drops of water, let it rest and open up, and you’ll be treated to a cornucopia of aromas.  You get wool and herbs.  First taste is 
mineral taste, a bit farm-y, hazelnuts.  There’s a surprising waxy side as well. That and the farmy taste must be the Brora. 

This is an excellent blend, and complexity head and shoulders over the Blue.  At the level of Compass Box’s high end stuff.  It’s not exactly cheap, and I have an issue with Brora being used in a blend...but personal feelings aside, it’s well engineered showcasing a plethora of aromas and layers of taste."

5.0,"Amazing, a must try."
4.5,"Pineapple, apples, and ginger stand out on the nose. The mouthful is light and velvety, followed by a delicious medley of nutmeg, gentle notes of sherry and hint of smoke on the palate. The finish is light and of medium-short length. Overall, this premium blend is balanced, complex, elegant and easy drinking. Very well worth a try."

3.75,"At $540, this is a good whisky, however it should be priced around $300. The resemblance of the old days of blue label is what this bottle brings back. The brora notes are very predominant. It would be a 5* if the price was more reasonable."

5.0,"The blender of this whisky did a magnificent job.  You can taste the old whisky in this blend quite easily.  Rewards extra time in the glass and a few drops of water.  Exhibits complexity with a faint whisp of smoke and ash along with dry fruits and a wee bit of sweetness.  Peat is subdued.   Only real negative is price, but I am not unhappy with my purchase.  Bravo."

4.5,"The negative on this is clearly price. But the taste is dynamite. It's Blue but with added complexity and depth wrapped around the awesome smoothness of Blue. Would so love another bottle if I could fined for $225ish. But above that, it's hard to justify despite it being so darn delicious."
4.0,"GREAT whisky, but I don't think anyone would 5 star this on a blind taste. There's true craftsmanship on the blend, as all of the notes work in harmony, but I think they sacrificed texture for the sake of flavour. There's no body - it's incredibly fragile, and while the finish lingers, it also lacks depth. Still fantastic even though the price is fantastical.

Touch of tropics on the nose, with a predominance of ginger and pear. Palate has hints of smoke and subtle spice, with a pleasant amount of heat on the tongue."

4.0,Really interesting dram. Popcorn and mint make a really different flavour combination. Although a great  dram it's not one I personally would drink a lot of due to the mint characteristic. I much preferred the Port Ellen version. Great way to hit the 600th review milestone with a double heading of ghost distilleries!
4.5,"Nose - Nice fruity & floral, tropical fruity sweet, nice spicy oak, hint of leather & chocolate, pineapples/ripe plantains

Taste - Tropical vanilla, sweet dark oaky spice, tropical citrusy/light fleshed fruity sweet, waxy rich mouthfeel, light chocolate bitterness, light bitter burnt toffee.

Finish - Lingering light bitter spice, full mouthfeel, dark chocolate covered ginger spice sweet, fresh light fleshed tropical fruits (pineapple, carombola aka starfruit, plantains, both ripe & unripe as there's this slight tannic/dry note)

Score - 90/100

Final Thoughts - This one had an absolutely amazing nose in that it somehow managed to be both dark sugars and light fruit aromas at the same time. This transitioned to the taste as well and was quite a nice contrast, all the while having this nice rich mouthfeel that just coated your mouth. It was a bit dry on the backend and finish in that it was similar to eating a super starchy fried plantain.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - Not sure I'd pick up another"
