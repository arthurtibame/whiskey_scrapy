1.0,Hot and thin. Burns like a very young whiskey. Decent nose. Not much to it. Would not recommend purchasing or even ordering off a liquor list. Drinks much cheaper than it is.

4.0,"Rack: 11404.12

A gift and my first experience with Calumet Farms. I really enjoyed this. Nice heat at 92Proof, this bottle first hit with bubblegum on the nose. Quickly opening up to more bourbon and wood centric notes. The flavor hits with nice fruitiness and billows across the tongue with some sweet and spicy notes. I recently had Michters US*1 10yr, and I enjoyed this more.

Aroma: Bubblegum, oak, vanilla, & honey.
Flavor: Fruit, vanilla, toffee, black pepper, & spiced orange.
Aftertaste: Long burn, caramel, & pepper
Body: Medium-heavy"

4.0,"Tasting:  Neat 2 oz. pour in a rocks glass.

Nose: (4.0) Sweet buttery nose.  Loads of vanilla and honey.  Reminds me of bit of honey candy.  

Palate:  (3.75)  More ethanol than I expected.  Vanilla comes forward, honey takes second seat.  Candy corn on the palate too but not cloying.  Mouthfeel is thicker and a bit oily.  Coats well.  

Finish (3.75):  Nice long finish, gets a little bitter at the end.  The candy corn stays with you and turns a bit waxy towards the end.

Overall:  I liked this one.  Pleasant surprise for me.  It is a sweeter bourbon that is well suited for dessert.  Some might say it is too sweet and perhaps looses its balance there.  If you could be just under 4 overall but north of 3.75 that is where I am at so rounding up here."

3.0,"Nose is buttery, sweet. Pallet is woodsy to me. Burn is a 4. Finish is pleasing and short."
4.25,"Nose: sweet, I can smell the vanilla and sweet syrup. 

Taste: at first, there’s a little spice, but quickly fades into a sweet caramel finish with a smooth ending"

3.5,"Nose: sweeeet, honey and vanilla, salt water taffy, cream, green apples. 

Palate: spicy, and full of fire. Honey comes through. Slight oak

Finish: meaty and medium-long. Oil mouth feel. Pretty nice.

Overall it’s a very spicy sipper, especially only being 92 proof I was blown away. I don’t find it very complex as the sweetness takes over and is replaced then with the burn. But it is interesting, nose is the best part.

80/100

3.75,"This is a pretty fun, unique bourbon. High rye with a nice burn, a little bitter, but with a distinct unique palette of banana. Lots of vanilla and burnt brown sugar on the nose. Fruity and sweet on the front, rye burn towards the end, with a really unique aftertaste of banana and cinnamon."

3.0,"Cheating - this is a 10 year single barrel from a local store.  

Nose - vanilla, powerful, red fruits and oak.  Caramel.  

Taste - Oh man sweet vanilla and caramel, and lightly toasted oak.  Such an easier drinker, so much caramel and nice easy to drink flavors.  Alcohol is well in the background.  Powerful flavor, good kick, and super drinker.  

I find myself reviewing a lot of stuff at 3.0 and this is another one.  Keep in mind, why would I own it if it weren't a 3?"
