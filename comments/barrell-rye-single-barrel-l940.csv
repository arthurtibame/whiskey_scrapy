2.0,"Let me start by saying I’m a huge Barrell fan. Their Bourbon, Infinite Barrel, New Years, and Dovetail occupy a hallowed place on my shelf.

This SiB Rye is a swing and a miss though. A scorcher at 126+ proof but lacking the depth that would make you want to drink anything that strong with a finish I can only describe as “medicinal”.

Still love ya, Barrell...but this was an expensive mistake for me."
2.5,"L940, 126.96 Proof. Smells like grass and cardboard. Oily texture but palate seems thin.  Tracks the nose. Maybe a hint of milk chocolate. Spice. Otherwise an understated palate. Almost boring, but not offensive. 12/6/19"
