4.5,"My cousin had some at Thanksgiving. Though I had to taste out of paper cups - long story, this is a VERY good bourbon; it made the Weller 12 taste like an “also ran” - at best! However, I’ll leave to others to describe the flavors and smells better b/c of the paper cups I had to use.) Won’t best GTS, WLW, or Pappy 15 (I haven’t had the 20 or 23), but this is an excellent bourbon. (I enjoyed this more than Wild Turkey Master’s Keep, MacAllen 18, and Yamazaki 12; trying to compare to similar price points.) I worried the age would be too much to enjoy - I’ve heard that liquid sitting in the virgin American Oak longer than 15-18 yrs isn’t pleasing to all palates (differing from Scotch, since their barrels aren’t virgin). I didn’t find any of that problem here, though a good bit of the wood flavor is present. It was an excellent dram that I would continue to enjoy. At the $150-200 price, it’s hard to say “it’s worth it”, but if you come across this drink and it’s within your price range, it’s worth sampling."
5.0,"Dusty, tart green apples on the nose with a hint of mint and candied sweetness. The complexity on the palate is beyond unique. You do pick up on the nutmeg and allspice. Definitely oak forward (25 yrs will do that). Warm, figgy sweetness, but no ""spicy"" finish they advertised. Very smooth. I preferred the 24 to the 25, but still make no mistake about it being one of the best I've had."

3.0,This is pretty decent but if I’m being honest it’s not worth the hunt/price. I’ve had far younger bottles that were faaaarrr smoother.
4.75,"Oak, allspice up front with a lingering pepper and vanilla finish.  Up there with Pappy in terms of flavor and drink experience. A bit overwhelming and complex. but let it breath and add a dash of ice to open it up."

5.0,"One of the best tasting bourbons I have EVER had. For my palette, I will take it over van winkle bourbon any day regardless of year. (And yes, I’ve had pappy 23 at a whisky tasting event.) Complex is usually not a word used to describe bourbon, but this is the exception. This noses as dark dried fruit, like figs and cherries with allspice and oak in the background. A deep rich scent that reaches into your sinuses and tickles your brain. The taste up front is smooth and sweet with the spiciest of the rye coming through that first swallow. As it hits the back of your tongue, ghosts from 25 years in the barrel rise up, letting sample a variety of oak tones as it fades into a slight sweetness and after tones of vanilla. An amazing sip of history that will be remembered long after the bottle runs dry."

5.0,"I had the good fortune of purchasing  a bottle of Pappy Van Winkle 20 2016 when I got into this hobby two years ago.  This is the closest I have come to that experience.  When I first cracked the bottle I was not too impressed.  A week later, and wow; it's really impressive.  If you like oaky, complex bourbon get a bottle.  You won't be disappointed."

4.0,"Alcohol, brown sugar, baking spices and maple on the nose.  This initially has lots of heat and alcohol, but at 91 proof....this is likely the 25 years of oak shining through.  A little water lets the maple syrup flavor, spice and cinnamon/ nutmeg flavors come out.  

This is not a Bourbon for everyone, but it is a interesting try.  For the money, there are better Bourbons on the market....but there is some history in this bottle with the Bernheim distilling and Stitzel-Weller storage.

As the purported final bottling of this series, this bottle shows what 25 years in a barrel can do in comparison to the prior bottlings - as this one seemed oakier. An interesting comparison is a taste test between this bottle and Entrapment (25 years in Canada, which was sweeter and less oak forward)."

4.25,"With a cube it’s better neat in my opinion.  Still very good no complaints.  

More coco and less vanilla neat"
4.5,Neat no ice.  Vanilla is strong excellent pour.   Not spicy
4.75,"Caramel 
Sweet caramel, butterscotch, mild salty brine, vanilla, oak, tannin, spice leather, traces of dried fruit
Sweet and salty caramel, butterscotch, vanilla, spicy notes then medium oak and rye burn 5 to 10 seconds in takes over but mild for Orphan Barrel then moderate tannin fur followed by nutty, leather, sweet butterscotch, caramel, vanilla, maple, cedar, cinnamon notes for very smooth and complex finish
Drops of water bring forward nutty, buttery tannin cinnamon notes though butterscotch and maple decline. Would likely do without water.
Tasted head to head with the 24 year and the 25 is much smoother with far more complex notes during its long, very smooth finish"

4.25,"Nose: same general nose as the 24 year. Sweet and vanilla. Probably a little more vanilla though. 
Palate: much less bite and much more oak. The fruitiness takes a step back after the extra year. 
Finish: mainly oak with a little bit of vanilla. 

Still a solid bourbon to me!"

3.5,Very mellow tasting. Still has some bite. Not worth the price though.
4.75,It starts with an immediate and welcome noseful of Oak followed by caramel and a hint of green apple. A smoothness that I don’t want to end. Tobacco and leather. Hay and a touch of mint. I’ve found a new favorite!
4.5,"Tasting following a Rock Hill Farm and a Black & Blue burger, so may be some carryover from those....

Dark Amber appearance, as would be expected for 25 years in the barrel. Warm, pleasant nose with vanilla, light caramel and oak.

Sweet up front then fully expanding to fill your mouth with a smooth spice experience.Very nice balance, no burn, with a medium long finish in the mouth. actually builds as it lingers, then fades.

Not heavy or long in the throat to my surprise. very enjoyable, sippable bourbon. if I could buy a bottle, I would, and save it for a special occasion with special friends."

5.0,"This is what I wanted out of the other Rhetoric offerings. 

This is a very well balanced aged bourbon. The oak is prevalent, but is finally balanced out with caramel, vanilla, tobacco, and leather notes. The mouthfeel is oily and rich and the finish is long and lingering in the most pleasant way. 

The $140 price scared me off, but my wife happened to buy this as a Christmas gift for me. I’m so happy she did. This is spectacular bourbon."
4.0,"Had a pour for my birthday and it was delicious. Amazingly not over-aged, it’s smooth from start to velvety finish. All the traditional notes of a great bourbon with the only potential downside being not very many surprises  either."

4.75,"The nose starts out very oaky with a touch of mint alongside it, while rye spiciness, butterscotch and a hint of smoke balance it all out. The palate is strong of oak, rye and cinnamon on top of a nice creaminess of butterscotch, toffee, cocoa, vanilla, mint and a some cherry sharpening it all out. The finish is very long, oaky and spicy, balanced by vanilla, bitter cocoa and butterscotch. Not for everyone because of the strong oak, but wonderful for those that like aged bourbons."
4.25,"Nose - Cherries, vanilla and a hint of oak. Caramel? You can definitely tell there’s age

Palate - Oak up front, fruity and slight spice trail

Finish -Smooth as expected for the age

I like it, it’s on the sweeter side but balances well with a bit of spice. Worth the pour, maybe not the steep bottle price but wouldn’t pass it up if I had be opportunity for another pour"

4.25,Way nice smooth.  A must have. Before it is gone
4.0,"Neck pour: was great, really smooth and enjoyable. Most striking thing was the aged vanilla extract note that just comes with very old aged whiskey. That and then length of the barrel spice tingle on the finish given the lower proof. Was a great experience to get to have"

4.0,"I was expecting an almost unbearable over-oaked wood bomb. I was pleasantly surprised and this is the one that few like so I can only imagine how much better the 20-24 year variations taste like. Nose is oak but balanced with cherry, corn sweetness and caramel coming out of the glass immediately with a bit of ethanol. If you dig behind the dominant notes vanilla, char, malty note can be found. Very heavy and rich bourbon. The creamy vanilla, corn and fruit sweetness and wood take the lead on the palate, with the caramel, barrel and rye spices coming in right after. Finish is medium with the spice on the tongue leading the way and yielding to the vanilla and sweetness and you are left with cherry and apple and a dryness from the wood and barrel char notes. With water and/or time the vanilla cream and sweetness is intensified and the spice and oak character is cut in half. However the apple note because it is minor is lost with the water/time and nothing tones down the char notes from 25 years in a barrel."
3.5,Bought this after having the amazing 24 figuring this could only be better and unfortunately I was wrong.  It's still a decent pour but so much time in barrel muted everything to the point it really doesn't have much going on.  Not worth the splurge...

4.5,"Nose - charred oak, leather, candied bacon, cinnamon, allspice, evergreen (cedar?), cocoa powder. apple, orange peel, vanilla, black tea. A bit of smoke. Really complex, with different notes coming out as it breathes. Some of the notes I'm getting remind me of older Armagnacs I've had. 

Palate - Soft velvety mouthfeel isn't really thick, but coats the palate. Starts with dark brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, bittersweet chocolate, toast, vanilla, rye spice, and a hint of spearmint. Oak, baking spices, a bit of smoke/char and some tannins linger on the dry finish, which is quite lengthy.

A few drops of water didn't do this bourbon any favors. The nose became a bit sweeter but also less complex. The palate flattened out, and got a little astringent on the finish. Definitely preferred it without water. 

I really like this one. People talk about Orphan Barrel and older Heaven Hill releases being over-oaked and similar to sucking on a two-by-four, but that wasn't my experience. Rhetoric 25 doesn't have that bitterness that I associate with truly over-oaked whiskey (which BTW doesn't have to be super-old - there's a lot of bitter, over-oaked whiskey coming out of TX that's less than 4yrs old)."

5.0,"Explosive aromas jumping out at me, caramel, butterscotch, annise, mint, cinnamon, dark cocoa powder, black cherry, cedar, oak, pine, medicinal, shoe polish. So much going on in here and its screaming to be let out of the bottle. 

Multi leveled flavor here. First, its luxurious in the mouth. So smooth and very little burn. Starts with some smoke and cinnamon, turns into caramel turtles, vanilla, oak, and more oak dominate the super long finish. Minutes

First experience with a bourbon of this age and I am a fan. Excellent job balancing sweetness with oak tannins that come with barrel age. This is my new favorite of all. This is maybe, my perfect whiskey. Now to try and not drink it too fast..."
