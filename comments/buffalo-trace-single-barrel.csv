4.0,Strong nose on this bourbon. This is a 2019 pick by NKY bourbon group called “Gone in 60 Seconds”. Really oaky taste to it with a molasses smoky finish.

4.25,"This is a WW&W (Louisville) store pick from 2018. 

Nose: vanilla, oak, dark fruit
Palate: butterscotch, oak, honey, just a little burn
Finish: orange, tea, smooth

Basically a more balanced and enhanced Buffalo Trace.  Excellent."
