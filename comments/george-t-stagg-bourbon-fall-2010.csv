4.0,Not sure what year this one is. Big bite due to the barrel strength. A bit syrupy in the mouthfeel. Sweet after the bite dissipates. Nice stuff. Probably better with a drop or two of water.
4.5,"138.2 proof

👀 amber red and vegetal oils.  Tails last.  

👅 coats the gums but the spice isn’t overbearing for its age.  Dances all over the palate.  Hits with vanilla 

🏁 sting lingers but it hurts well. Finishes with corn and the sting is like a rollercoaster; strong mild up down"

4.75,"Not sure what release I had, but was able to taste this at the Owl's club in Tucson for only like 15$.  It was amazing, super hot but once I savored it for a while and took really tiny sips I started picking up a ton of complexity, I would spend a lot on this, probably over $150 if I ever came across a bottle"
4.5,"So complex, starts hot, then leaves a beautiful Kentucky hug after a spicy finish. Large amounts of Carmel and oak notes throughout. Delicious. A big boy bourbon!"
