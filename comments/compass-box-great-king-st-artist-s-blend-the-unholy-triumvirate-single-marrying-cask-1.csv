3.0,"Another sample I bought with me on a business trip to Orlando.  This again is courtesy of @Richard-ModernDrinking.  Between 31, 68, and this one, my favorite so far was 31.  This has a nice fruity palette, almost like lemon drops.  Given a choice between the regular Artist  blend and this one, I’d pick this a hair above the regular.  Thanks Richard!"
4.0,"So, thanks to @Richard-ModernDrinking I am able to try a few more variations of the Compass Box Great King St Artist’s Blend Single Marrying Cask (whew, that’s a mouthful).  This is Artist’s Blend refilled back into some of the casks used to make the original blend and aged for another year, then bottled at near cask strength.  This particular cask (No 1) was bottled at 49% ABV and offers a deeper reflection of what the Artist’s Blend can be if left alone a little longer.

It’s yellow gold in the Glencairn and appears somewhat watery with lots of runny legs that form quickly when you spin the glass.  A nice oily slick remains awhile, but there still significant indication of water added to get the ABV down to bottling strength.  It’s still 6% higher than the regular AB.

The nose is initially grainy with nice pops of lemon zest.  There’s a weaker oak profile throughout, but a nice juicy fruit gum note permeates the entire nosing.  Waxy malt notes are present, as well.

The palate is slightly fruitier than the original Artist’s Blend.  It’s lemony smooth on the tongue with a nice, oak barrel backbone offering solid structure.  This is better than the Bounty Hunter Cask #69 bottle that I purchased and reviewed a few months back.

The finish is short, but oily and warm.  I think I like this even better than the mass produced Artist and Glasgow Blends.

Overall, this one is close to being a 4-star dram for me.  The juicy notes kick it up a notch and it’s still waxy and velvety smooth like most Compass Box whiskies.  It’s a shame this one is more limited because I wouldn’t mind having a bottle or two of this sitting behind the bar.  Thanks again, Richard.  I’m looking forward to the other samples you sent.  Cheers."
3.0,A malty lemon nose. Flavors of Custard Cream biscuits that dissolve into honey throat lozenges. See cask #31 for more information on this series.
