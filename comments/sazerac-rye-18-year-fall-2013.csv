3.75,"NOTE: tasting Fall 2011 

The 2011 bottle is good but not worth the hype, can’t speak to later offerings. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed it but wouldn’t spend secondary market prices. Smooth at first but then hits almost immediately with some burn, lots of spice. The finish is uneventful, pick up on licorice, medicinal flavors."

3.0,"Not a big fan of rye's, but this was recommended as it was smooth and did not have that initial malt taste.  It was a pleasant surprise."
5.0,"Editors note: I have the 2010 release which I've held onto for 4 years before opening. In that time I stored it improperly for about a year and the bottle has been thru a house fire. But still...strong rye nose with a smooth and oily texture and a long finish perfect balance between wood and whiskey for an 18 year.  Call me biased or sentimental but I'm giving this 5 stars just because it's still so damn good even after all the shit I put it thru, just like my Samantha."
