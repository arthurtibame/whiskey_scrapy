3.0,"Has a woody scent that burns a bit on the nose. Tastes stronger than the ABV and has a sharp heat, but is a clean bourbon and would likely be good in an mixed drink."
3.25,"Strong wheat and slight burning on the nose. Feels a lot stronger than 46% ABV. Nice wheat taste, slightly bitter, not very complex. Aftertaste is mostly a milder version of the mouth taste."
