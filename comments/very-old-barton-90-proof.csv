2.5,Fine generic bourbon.

2.5,"Nose- Pepper and sweet tea 
Body- This is a spicy one with black pepper, a bit of cinnamon, and a cherry note. 
Finish- Herein lies the rub. The dark pit fruit which I like gives way to a bitter aftertaste that I don’t care for."

2.5,"It's Bourbon. Not horrible, not great, it just is. Thin, not very complex, short finish, decent mixed with cola. Many worse things out there at a higher cost."

3.5,"Nose: cleaner, cherry and vanilla, a tiny bit of spice

Palate: super sweet at first and then opens up to some spice and heavy caramel. Very very light and sweet though

Finish: light, thin, and no burn and short"
3.25,One of my favorite budget bourbons. Am I the only one who gets banana on the nose?

4.0,"I'm not much of an expert but this one tastes a little............ different........ than other bourbons I've tried. I like it a lot. A little hard to find lately, but it's very cheap and pretty damn smooth. $23 for 1750 ml"
2.75,Decent. Not a huge wheated fan but cannot complain too much over $17
