2.0,Definitely smell the hops when you open; you don't taste it as much as the scent

1.0,Only worth drinking to compare with Dead Guy Ale. Interesting to see a whiskey from the same ingredients. Barely drinkable. The most prominant aroma is banana.

1.0,"Pretty bad whiskey, especially considering the $40 price tag. Sloppy, unrefined, and disappointing all around. If you're really dying to try it, spring for a pour at a bar rather than forking out the cash for a bottle. I don't even think I would pay $15 for a bottle."

1.0,Ummmmm nope.  I should have given it a 0.5 but I can't.   No flavor even moonshine has more flavor.  Stick with beer Rogue.
3.0,Not a fan

2.0,Rogue makes some of my favorite beer. So I give this an A- just for effort but am rating it a 2.0.  This is a good start into whiskey as the beginning is clean but the flavor is so overly complex that it actually loses out on quality on the finish in the palette.  Especially for the price.  Sometimes simple equals more. Good starter whiskey for some.  Not for the seasoned whiskey drinker.
4.0,Young age creates a bold transition on the palate.

2.5,Different smell than I’m used too.   Grainy and a little tart. Get some sweetness initially with the grain taking over on the back end. Light on the oak notes
1.25,Can’t place the “flavor.”  Dirty dish rag comes to mind. No body or aftertaste which is a blessing I suppose.

3.5,"Unique flavor, sweet, Smokey flavor and nose"
3.0,"The new packaging is great.  The whiskey...is coming along.  This should not have been released yet.  The whiskey is too young.  Minimum of two years it says, Maximum of two years it is.  It’s a bit too sweet and unbalanced.  The malt bill carries the day here, much like the beer it’s distilled from however there’s just not quite enough depth to make it worth the money.  Yet.  Rogue has come along way with their spirits and they are showing strides of improvement and don’t seem to be slowing down. I look forward to when they really get the patience to release
some mature fine tuned product."

2.5,"Bitter at first, better on the rocks and cold. After a few sips sweeter with vanilla taste"
2.75,"2010 version***
Nose is the bright spot in this whiskey with vanilla, fruit, bananas and pepper.
Taste is very muted compared to the intense nose. Vanilla and honey, wood and pepper"
3.5,"If you like unique whiskey, you’ve got to try this. Smooth and finishes with some salty hops. Easily a daily drinker. Great with pub food. Inexpensive."
3.25,"Salty, I taste the ocean. Fun change up and good for introducing different flavors to people. Not super sippable."

5.0,Just delightful. Smooth with a little bit of tart.
4.0,"Super sweet aroma that's maybe corn and chocolate.
Same flavor dominates, with maybe some medicine undertones. Same medicinal and chocolate flavor comes through the tail, very interesting contrast to the sweetness but it works. Points for being unique."

3.0,"This is the original retro Rogue Dead Guy Spirits. Bottle was aged in oak barrels for 1 month compared to the 2 year in the description.

Slightly oaky with a sweet fruity banana flavor. Very banana-y nose with notes of honey. Theres quite a sweet finish in the middle back of the palette. Theres a bit of an earthy grassy hint after a couple sips. The flavor profile definitely changes quite drastically with each sip."
4.5,Oak flavor really comes to the front.

null,"The nose is off. It just has an unpleasant ""wrongness"" to it. It smells like a high school gym locker owned by the kid who never takes a shower. The taste is hands down the worst thing I have ever drank. An order of magnitude worse than Sheep Dog.  I could at least see someone enjoying that.  Seeing that this is a distilled beer mash, it has a unique flavor that just tastes horrible. It has a nice oaky start but ends with a foul stale coffee flavor that lingers for an eternity. I wouldn't even give this to someone I don't want to come back, because I would hate the implication of my lack standards.

End opinion, save yourself the distress of drinking something that tastes like it was distilled in the casket of the guy pictured on the bottle."
