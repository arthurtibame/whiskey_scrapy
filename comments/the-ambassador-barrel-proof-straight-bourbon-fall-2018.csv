4.5,"Excellent MGP expression, 12 years old, not too oaky, just delicious stuff."
4.0,"This is the 2017 bottling. Very light, slightly musty nose. Slight honey after a minute, gets more syrupy with time. On the palate, smooth for the proof. Reminds me of sweet tea, a fruity tea with honey. Lingering spice in the back of the throat. The finish is one note, of spice, but it lasts forever. Nice and pleasant pour. 8/24/19"
