4.0,Sweet nose with a sweet peppery taste and a long spicy grain taste mellowed by very slight oak finish. Finishes with a slight ammonia hint. Very nice rye.

3.75,Spicy on the front but amazingly mellows out and balances on the backend with a leather finish
4.5,"Well, after a bit of a hiatus due to family issues, I’m working my way back to writing reviews.  I haven’t drank as much over the last 2-3 weeks, but I’ve got plenty of notes to choose from over the last month or so.  This was a special sample sent to me from a new trading partner out of Arizona:  Whistlepig Single Barrel 13 Year Old Rye.  It’s bottled at 112.7 proof and is sourced from Canada instead of the usual suspect- Indiana’s MGP distillery.  It was finished in ex-bourbon casks before being sold to a local, Arizona liquor store.  Price, I believe, was around $100.

It’s a beautiful, copper and amber and looks quite watery for such high proof.  Thin legs and heavy drops run down the Glencairn after a vigorous spin.  The nose starts out a bit muted, with spice cake, cocoa powder, brown sugar and spicy peppers.  There’s an interesting lack of dill note here, which is nice IMO.  Letting it set only releases more oak and pepper and causes it to lose the sweeter aspects.  Give it 5-6 minutes and dive on in.

The palate just shines with complexity:  toffee, caramel, tea leaves and barrel wood form a deeply rich thickness.  Some lighter citrus arrive around mid sip and provide a little bite.  The high ABV is hidden so well- which is something I seem to relate to almost every Canadian whiskey I’ve had.  Normally, I think that hurts most Canadian stuff, but definitely not here- this just tastes wonderful.  There’s warmth, sure, but it’s so rich and delightful that it just feels perfect.  The finish is long and a little biting, and that’s the only point I can take away from a near-perfect score.  It just brings things to a slightly shocking end- I was expecting a smoothness that just went on and on, but lingering cocoa and caramel keep the whiskey on your mind (and tongue) and just make you want to go back for more.

Overall, this is a gem of a rye whiskey.  Delicious, rich and a very rewarding experience.  The bite at the end just robs the ending ever so slightly.  It’s still a very nice dram.  Thanks, @dubz480.  Good stuff.  4.5 stars.  Cheers."

5.0,"I quite enjoy the standard expression of the Whistlepig 10 yr old Rye. It's a little overpriced for what it as (typically goes for around $80) but is undeniably a very tasty dram. For background the standard offering is a batch product aged for 10 years and sourced from Canada and MGP. It's then blended and bottled on Whistlepig farm in Vermont. 
Now on my way back from a lovely time at the Danish Village of Solvang in Socal I stopped at a local Liqour store that I have had success at in the past. Looking around this bottle really caught my eye! This was the last bottle they had from the barrel and it was priced very well at $79.99 (store picks tend to be closer to $100). Not only was this one a Single Barrel but it was also bottled at cask strength (112.7 proof) and also finished in ex Bourbon barrels. It is age stated at 10 years however, most of these store picks tend to be older (this specific one is 13 yrs old). This is also distilled in Canada (100% rye mashbill) versus in Indiana (MGP). I personally much prefer the Canadian barrels. They are more complex and less spicy and they don't have the off-putting dill note that the MGP ones can have. This one was bottled exclusively for Stagecoach Liqours. On to the review:
Right as it hits your lips you know you are in for something special. Rich and oily on the pallette with toffee, orange peel and clove bursting thru. As it rolls to the mid pallette everything becomes amplified with orange peel transitioning to orange oils. Juicy leather and tobacco joins the party with a long finish. Some cocoa and caramel. Outstanding! I thought the Knob Rye store picks were good, but this one blows them away. Probably the best rye I have had outside of Saz 18! Cheers all!"
4.25,"Color is Longhorn burnt orange.  The overall impression, for me, is cinnamon red-hots.  Pepper, acetone, caramel, and a subtle whiff of bark on the nose, and in the mouth you can almost taste wood staves and leather, reminiscent of an old library.  Lots of power, but all in balance, and dry as the desert.  More expensive than the standard Whistlepig 10-year, but a better buy for my tastes."
