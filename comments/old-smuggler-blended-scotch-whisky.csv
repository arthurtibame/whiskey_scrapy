1.25,"This is not a Scotch whiskey to sip and savor. The initial taste is not bad, I picked up a bit of honey and citrus, but the finish is absolutely horrible and resembles cleaning chemicals. I expiremented a bit and I found the only way to drink it is to shoot it as quick as possible to avoid the finish.  If you are looking for a cheap whiskey to do shots, then this is for you, but no scotch enthusiast should bother with this."

2.0,"Found a dusty old bottle in Dad's cabinet, probably 25 years since opening. Only a few drams were left at the bottom, so perhaps a fair test:

N: sweet wheat bread, acetone
T: thin mouthfeel, astringent, light  speyside blend notes but hard to get to. peaches, barley, rye bread crust. light smoke.
F: too weak to burn, and a punishment is a surprisingly long bitter aftertaste. faint raisins, cloves, apple skins.

would never recommend, but etched in memory of an evening with family exploring the liquor cabinet!"

1.0,Found this in my father-in-law’s alcohol cabinet - it tasted diluted and  just poor in general. It gave me the impression it was grabbed from one of the bottom shelves of a nearby supermarket.
