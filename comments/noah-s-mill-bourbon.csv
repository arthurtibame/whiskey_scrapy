4.25,Smokey and smooth
4.5,"Sweet nose - for some reason I keep thinking of marshmallows as I nose it. Little nuttiness to go along with the sweet scent. Very smooth baking spices and maybe some green apple on the palate. Light vanilla fades to oak as the heat from the alcohol comes on with a cinnamon stick & rye spice. Honestly, this drinks like a 90 proof bourbon until the very end. This may have a spot in my top 10."
5.0,"It’s been a while since I’ve had a kick from a whisky. This definitely packs a punch. Mellows our with an ice cube. 

Nose: mint fresh drier sheet. Delicate leather. 

Taste: spice that tickles the back of your nose. Cinnamon. 

Finish: pepper. Heat. 

It’s a great one. Great price. Lots going on. Will purchase again. Not for a casual drinker. It’ll put hair on your chest."
4.25,“Spicy” Excellent over a cube of ice
4.25,"Nose: sweet, vanilla
Palate: dried fruit, tannic

 A little sharper than I was expecting, but good"

4.25,Typical Willet Profile
3.5,One of the most unique bourbons you’ll ever taste. Nose is extremely sweet mixed with tons of cinnamon and floral notes. Bites exactly like bookers so i suggest splashing a bit of water. Must have for a collection. Drink sparingly.

4.5,"Tremendous sweet and aromatic spiced nose. Caramely, sweet, viscous on the tongue. Not sharp and not bitter. Truly like nothing I’ve ever tasted. Will be buying more."

4.0,Has a nice spice to it towards the end.
4.25,Delightful heat
4.0,"The nose is very unique. One of my favorite smelling bourbons. The alcohol is very strong, I’ve tried it straight, with water, and ice. They’re all great. With water it’s very sweet and it brings out every single note you can’t get with all the alcohol in the way. However, after drinking 2-3 glasses with water i got turned off by the sweetness. It felt like i was drinking candy. It’s fruity, sweet, strong, and spicy. I highly recommend to add this to your collection/bucket list."
4.25,"Nose: herbal tea, vanilla, oak. Alcohol, caramel, brown sugar, chocolate covered cherries, bonfire.

Palate: oak, medicinal cherry, corn, wood, dark chocolate.

Finish: spicy and medium to long, slightly hot.

Overall a great expression from willet, high proof thick Bourbon that needs time to sit and open up. Fairly complex at $40-$50. A clear winner."
4.0,"N: light vanilla, sweet butterscotch
P: Vanilla bomb! Oily
F: Oak and char. Long finish"

0.25,I didn’t like this at all. It’s a hot spicy mess. Couldn’t get past a couple of sips.

4.0,"Color: Amber. Oily with slow legs

Nose: Brown sugar, vanilla, oak, ripe stone fruit, hints of maple syrup

Palate: Vanilla, oak, stone fruits, rich and meaty, oily

Finish: Long finish with rye spice that crescendos in intensity. Heavy oak tannins sap your tongues moisture. Faint hint of mint in background.

Noah’s Mill is in my bourbon top 5 list. This dram isn’t for the faint of heart. Off the bat it’s hot the nose and palate but, letting it develop helps tamp the sharp edges. It’s very oak and vanilla forward throughout with ripe stone fruits bursting through. The intensity of the finish builds on the quicker side and after climaxing lingers for quite some time."

4.0,Great taste but strong
4.0,"Nutty on the nose, nuts and spices on the pallet, completely coats your entire mouth, nice burn on the back end. Unique and solid pour for the price"
4.0,"Cinnamon and toffee, with a hint of vanilla, caramel, and nuts.  Nice spice upfront that doesn’t linger."
3.75,"Oak is pronounced on the palate. (Noah tells me he's pretty old.)  As the sweetness and the wood swirl around, the liquid provides a thick, satisfactory mouthfeel.  A bit of dryness there.  The sweet notes continue to open up into the finish, as the oak and spice leaves the mouth tingling.  Very smooth for a 57% ABV.  The finish completes with hints of licorice, pine, and hot cinnamon candies.  

This is my new favorite bourbon.  So much so that I doubt I'll be able to keep this bottle stocked on my shelf for the next forty days and forty nights.

4.5,"I definitely get the leather and a long, spicy finish. I normally steer clear of spicy, but I really like this. There's a lot going on with this.  It's freaky one sip can have three different stages, but I get three very distinct flavors with this initially, on the tongue, and then the finish.  One odd thing I've noticed both times I've tasted now though is that it leaves me throat feeling a bit raw, which other bourbons haven't done."

3.0,"I picked up a bottle but after a month or two of sippping it off and on I’m not blown away. I do enjoy the chocolate on the front end but it’s a little too hot. I feel the alcohol too much in this one and that’s usually the case of a lacking of flavors. I feel and taste the strength of the cinnamon and feel the abundance of this was to overcome the high alcohol but it was not efficient enough, for my pallet at least."
