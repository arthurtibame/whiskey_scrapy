4.25,"The color is a rich, deep amber with thick legs that easily coat the glass. The nose right away lets you know that it is wheated and only hints at it's high proof. A nice mix of baking spices comes out along with charred oak, with smooth notes of vanilla, caramel, dark chocolate and a little bit of green apple that slowly opens up at the end. The palate is dry but chewy with a burst of oak and baking spices, quickly followed by vanilla and dark chocolate all while green apple presents itself lightly in the background. The finish is long and full spicy, dry oak along with dark chocolate, while the rest of the palate nicely fades as you chew on it leaving you wanting more."
