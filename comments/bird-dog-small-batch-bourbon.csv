3.5,I definitely agree that this has a less complex body. It’s good but not great. The nose is pleasant and the finish is smooth and enjoyable.

3.0,Heavy oak on initial nose that mellows into citrusy notes. Very sweet on the front like smooth honey and oranges with mild spices. Finish is medium duration and gives a kick of peppery notes with the continued citrus flavor

2.75,"Strong alcohol smell, not a lot to the nose. From a taste standpoint get some pepper but fades quick.  Better than I thought, bought for the label when Cruzin the bottom row."

1.25,"This one wasn't great, there are far better options for a lower price. On the nose, it mostly smells like young greens with a faint hint of a sweet corn. The taste is odd. It's definitely peppery, but every other flavor seems muddled. You can definitely do better than this."
2.0,"Young, spicy and hot, probably be good in an old fashioned."
