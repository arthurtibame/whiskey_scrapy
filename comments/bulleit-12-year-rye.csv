3.25,"Powerful,  biting woody vanilla nose.

Spicy and sharp like you’d expect from a rye, but pleasantly smooth with a lingering finish."

3.25,"good rye - spicy, some dill and eucalyptus notes"
3.0,I tasted a menthol. The after taste had a little less to be desired. However extremely smooth. Good nose.

Definitely an enjoyable first sip.  Smooth long finish.  A value at $50 price point."

3.0,This Bulleit whiskey is real nice when it opens up on a ball of ice for a minute. I'm adding this to my top shelf.

4.25,Strong rye spice on the nose and immediately on the palate. Sweet vanilla and a touch of citrus on the finish. Solid expression

3.25,"Tasted 8/3/19

I was excited to try this 12 rye and was equally as excited to find out is was selling for only about $45 a bottle! Luckily before buying a bottle I had a pour at the bar. For being 12 years old I thought that it was slightly above average at best."

4.5,"What rye should be, all the time. Unfortunately, time is the big factor here. The initial smell from the glass is instant wood, and misleadingly sweet and reminiscent of a bourbon. First taste contact gives way to that sweet, marinated oak, but very easily (yet still quickly) moves into the very familiar Bulleit rye mash bill. Finally, one of the best budget ryes on the market has been properly amplified into the spicy, wooden finish that at least I am always on the hunt for with rye whiskeys. This is hard to put down, so forgive me, wallet."

3.5,Sweet good RYE flavor. Pretty hot.
4.0,"Nice vanilla flavor balances out a mellowed but still spicy rye bite.  It has the characteristic fruitiness that I associate with bulleit.  Some barrel notes. It's got a bit of dry wood and smokiness in the finish.  Note overly complex, but well balanced with a great flavor profile.

This is a really pleasant and drinkable whiskey.  If this was more readily available, this could very easily become my go to whiskey in this price range."
4.0,Incredibly smooth with classic rye flavor a touch of sweetness a bit of spice. I like a good punch in the mouth and with a bit more spice I may have given this one 5 stars but for the general consumer I think this fits the bill.

4.0,"Nose: oh boy, this is why I love rye.  Eucalyptus, baking soda, pixie sticks, vanilla, dusty herbs, cotton candy, strawberry. A full nose if you take the time to look. 

Taste: cotton candy (including the finish it falls right off), citrus zest, herbal spice, ending with dirty earth.

Experience: walking through a herb and citrus garden while sipping sweat tea. Sweet and earth notes mingle with a herbal undertone.

Note: this is the classic Bulleit rye turned up. If you like the base offering you'll like this a bit more, if you don't like the base this will not change your mind.
Let this open up or go back to it after opening and using the bottle, at first I was disappointed by how close to the standard rye it is, but after a week or so I found the complexity that the younger brother lacks."
3.75,alcohol taste.  unfinished
2.0,"Good nose, some sour fruit. Bitter note on the palate. Wood note is strong, makes sense given the age. Surprisingly thin nd straightforward given the age. Some spice. Pleasant. 6/21/19"

4.0,"Neat.  Nose is fabulous.  Tons of vanilla and stewed fruit.  Bright fruit like apples and apricots.  Some toasted marshmallow hiding Behind these high notes.  Really delightful.

Texture is light and a bit watery.  Taste is delicious and matches the nose.  Legs last a surprising amount of time.  

Damn it!  Why couldn’t this be a higher proof.  At 110, I bet this would rival Willet (MGP as well I know.)  It’s really good but it could be unbelievably great with some more weight behind it."

3.75,"Nose: Oak.  Dill, anise, red bell pepper, floral.  Vanilla.  Cardamom, cumin.  Hint of black pepper 

Palate: White sugar, classic rye flavors - more of that anise, red bell pepper, dill.  Oak.  Black pepper.  Slight tannin.  Long finish."

3.75,"On the nose getting ginger, nutmeg, fresh cut lime, spun sugar, fennel, spearmint, and toffee. An unusual combination to say the least. 

On the palate, it opens with a generic kind of sugar cane sweetness followed by rye spice, nutmeg, ginger, a bit of vanilla, and prominent anise. 

White pepper, more anise, and lots of bitter oak on the finish which has has some pop to it and is medium in length. Mouthfeel is light and grainy. 

Despite being a little bit disjointed and chaotic, the whole is greater than the sum of it’s parts. Enjoyable, but not a top choice at this price point. Glad I tried it, but at $54 it falls a little short of rebuy status for me."
5.0,"Nutmeg, a bit of clover, after a while even mint, and that's just the nose! Spicy, but not hot, herbal, but not medicinal. Simply superb."
4.0,"It's 12 year old Bulleit Rye, (or MGP), it's the 95-5 bill, you would think this is the ultimate contender in the MGP 95 style rye, and you'ed probably be right.   For me this is something of a deciding moment, I've been on the edge of the ""pure rye"" vs the high corn rye debate for some time, and it's a toughy.  I like both for different reasons.   

First off, 12 year Bulleit rye is VERY good rye.  The nose has a wonderful sweet rich purity to it, dill, caraway, pumpernickel whatever the ""rye spice"" is, it is certainly present in rich warm quantity. On the palate you get that hot spice bite that is trademark rye and while it's clearly strong it stays clean and pure.  The extra barrel time yields an evident sweet wood note that is hardly or not at all noticeable in standard 3-6 year 95 ryes.  Not quite a vanilla or caramel, it's more of a general sweetness.   While it lacks some of the character and sweetness of the 3 grain ryes, that doesn't detract from the fact this is just some damn good and tasty rye.  Being one of the priciest offerings in the line it at least lives up to some of that high expectation.   What you won't get is an overly complex profile or any really unexpected notes,  my assumption being that a 95-5 rye is simply incapable of undertaking some of the more serious barreling factors that create some of the more esoteric and elaborate notes in well aged bourbons.  

For all the extra aging this still tastes like 95-5 mgp rye.    Thus the conundrum, is it really worth it to seek out and pay extra for a fairly acceptable and easy to find rye taste that's only marginally upgraded?  That's for you to decide.  
Cheers!"

3.5,"Noses like a rye should, sweet, oak, maraschino cherry and peppery. Complex.

Starts pleasantly dry, crisp, dried fruits, and spice. Hot and slightly peppery. Combo of sweet and spiced.

Finishes slightly sweet, the age I think helps turn down the spice hit, adds some fruit notes."
3.5,Cinnamon and spice and everything nice!! Nice lingering finish with a hint of anise.
3.5,"The last 1/3 of the bottle finished better than the first 2/3’s but, I likely won’t buy it again. There are better ryes on the shelf."

4.0,Good upfront taste and a great black liquorish ending.
3.0,I’m not impressed. Average at best. The only hint this is a 12 year rye is the label on the bottle. It’s not much different than a 4 year.
