4.0,"Single Barrel, 11 years, 114.4 proof, released 2018. Wow, great nose. Fruit and dill. Strong pickle juice on the palate, but balanced with a plethora of notes otherwise. Complex. Towards the end, dark chocolate and sour ale/lambic notes. Smooth for the proof. Long finish. Quality. 2/22/19"

    Nose - (w/o water) Sweet dark vanilla toffee, cinnamon spice, light sweet mint, buttered rye toast (w/ water) not much change.
    
    Taste - (w/o water) Heavy cinnamon spice/heat/tingle, dark chocolate covered dark toffee, sweet mint, hint of cherry coke concentrate (w/ water) Spice softens up considerably, dark chocolate, sweet mint is barely present now, more balanced cherry coke concentrate.
    
    Finish - (w/o water) Lingering cinnamon spice, lightly drying, woody cherry coke concentrate (w/ water) Lingering vanilla, chocolate, cherry coke concentrate.
    
    Score - 92/100
    
    Final Thoughts - This was a really great rye. I'm a bit disappointed I didn't pick up a few more bottles when I had the chance because for the price I paid back then, this is a fantastic cask strength, 8 year old rye that hits all the notes I like in a rye. Nice sweet mint I usually get from MGP combined with a nice cherry coke concentrate flavor I quite like. A tiny bit of water really opens it up and softens out most of the harsh/woody notes in this. This would be great both neat with a tiny bit of water, or in a basic old fashioned.
