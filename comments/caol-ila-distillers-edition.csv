4.0,"On the first tip of the glass you can feel the peat burst into your nose. Then the peppery notes dance on your tongue, the peat settles to subtle finish on the back of your tongue, and you know you are experiencing something special. One of my favourites on a cold Canadian winter afternoon."

5.0,"Nose: Lovely peat, black pepper, that slightly appley fruit that smells like the Caol Ila stillhouse, flavorful barbecue smoke, and the wine finish adds an icing sugar sweetness and vanilla note over the top. Beautiful and elegant. Palate: Sweet syrupy fruit (pears) arrival, after which the peat arrives along with some black pepper.  Finish: Peat rush to start, then black pepper, ash, then a medium spiciness.  Final Thoughts: I have found that my appreciation of the moscatel-finished Caol Ilas is not shared by everyone, but I must say that I LOVE this stuff.  I feel the moscatel compliments the Caol Ila profile beautifully and I find this a wonderful dram. One of my favorite wine finished drams.  Bravo, Caol Ila!"

null,"""Les gens à Diageo ont choisi correctement le type de vin pour finir un peated, le whisky gras(huileux). Le miel et la fumée sont premiers à retenir votre attention avec le foyer(centre) se tournant au malt et des pêches mûres d'été. La fumée de tourbe est une constante. La richesse du whisky ne rassasie pas et comme vous finissez la petite gorgée, vous remarquerez un sec, l'épice la conclusion remplie."" PASSÉ EN REVUE PAR STEPHANIE MORENOC

I love the other Distillers Editions I've had, but this one is truly greater than the sum of its parts and elevates the normal Caol Ila range to something really special.  Hard to find in the US but worth an online order from the U.K. Or whatever you have to do to get ahold of a bottle."

On the palate it is sweet and smooth. There is peat, but just a bass tone. No scorched bacon, but replaced with burnt sugar. Peachy aftertaste. Definitely worth a spin."

Strong nuttiness (pecans?) and then comes a slightly sweet pineapple finish. Need to try again to figure out the nuttiness and tropical fruit. Smells like Lag, but the palette is so different."

4.5,"Sample review. I'm directly in love with this dram, will be on the lookout for a bottle. The fruity notes from the Moscatel sherry work perfectly together with the mild smoke and saltiness of Coal Ila. Tropical fruits and camp fire smoke on the nose. It has a very sweet arrival of again juicy tropical fruits. The finish is unmistakably Islay with peat, salt and smoke. Fantastic!"

5.0,"Scottish trip update, had a dram of this whisky at Oban’s tasting bar.  This might be one of the best value Islay whiskies out there.  The additional maturation adds some more richness to this dram and heightens its family resemblance to its cousin, Lagavulin.  The nose features brine, classic Caol Ila sweetness, and orchard fruit.  The palate is mellow honey, warm bonfire smoke, and a slight herbal grassiness, combining to form a rich and complex whole.  The end ties together toasted oak and coffee.  Like a gentler Laga 16, particularly at the end."

4.0,"(Double Matured in Moscatel Oak Wood: Distilled 2006/Bottled In 2017).
Perhaps, there is a legitimate reason to say that this particular version of Distillers' Edition is quite clear and comprehensible in a way of its intentions but it still is enjoyable as hell. Perfectly balanced, powerful, yet quite opposite to fierceful in terms of peat and smoke.
To the nose: apart from the strong general peatiness, iodine, smoke and medicinal tones there are many pleasing upper notes of ripe tropical fruits, sweet citruses, lemon pie, lollipops, yellow pear, peach jam; and also quite a few spicy nuances which include cinnamon, cardamom, a little bit of vanilla and ginger.
To the palate: smoky ashes again, light citruses, phenolic notes quickly fade to some secondary tones of bursting spices like cayenne pepper and heavy fruits; light but pronounced honey and caramel in the background, Juicy Fruit bubblegum.
The aftertaste develops much through time and lasts long enough to highlight its perks once again: bold peat, light malty/grain bitterness, citruses, raisins, many spices like cloves, nutmeg, anise and cinnamon, unused oak.
To sum up, CIDE appears to be a gentle and delicate whisky in a sense. Probably all due to the post-Moscatel oak barrels, what makes him versatile and light (comparing it to sherry-finished Islay whiskies)."

3.5,"The color is golden yellow, unfortunately artificially obtained.
The sense of smell is unusually sweet for a Caol Ila, rich in raisins, marzipan, cinnamon and honey in rivers, so as to almost hide the smoke of Islay, overwhelmed by this pastry cook. The wine has left a very decisive mark, a pity not to know how much the whisky has been exposed to.
The entrance to the palate still sees the smoke elbowing to emerge from the cake, and after a few moments finally climbs onto the podium, however keeping the honey in which it is immersed. The same hints of the nose burn on the lit fireplace, with the addition of a little candied fruit and a touch of salinity, which gradually bring to the background leaving ample space for the peat, which wears the sweet duster with a lot of nonchalance. The marriage is not very successful, the vinous influence is there but after the initial explosion it becomes little more than a tinsel.
In the not very long finish the ash and a spicy touch remain, the Moscatel seems to have returned to Spain a little disappointed: he had come to matare and it was matado."
