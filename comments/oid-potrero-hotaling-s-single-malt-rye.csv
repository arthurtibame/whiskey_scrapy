4.0,"When you first open the bottle, you get strong nose of tequila, which didn't impress me.  And the very first taste has a lot of the same qualities, but it quickly morphs into a smooth, buttery very flavorful rye.  I really like this, not sure how it will go into a sazerac but it's great for sipping."
1.0,Absolute garbage! Don't buy unless you like oak flavored moonshine. Young whiskey like this makes me so angry and they sell this shit for 60 + bucks. I understand young distilleries are trying to get in the market but don't piss on my leg and tell me it's raining.
