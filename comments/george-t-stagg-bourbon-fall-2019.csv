4.5,"N - oak, subtle spice, dark chocolate, caramel, hints of cherry, vanilla, leather

P - medicinal cherry, brown sugar and oak, pretty oily and little bit of heat

F - pure awesomeness, a long sweet finish with little bites of cherry along the way

Drank neat, added a couple drops of water and it opened it up nicely"
3.0,"Peppery caramel nose, hot nose, burnt a nostril
Great legs. Good flavor, caramel, and clean finish,
Opened up with a small cube of ice, to some banana notes"
5.0,"I’ve compared this side by side with the 2018 and personally, I think this is better. Caramel for days, raisins, butter, and a long finish. Others will disagree but I think this is tops for me!  Merry Christmas to all!"

4.5,"First taste: tobacco and cherry and a lot more oak than 2018s. Very subtle and a strong finish. 

*free pour at a gig*"
5.0,"Delicious. Finish on this one lasts so long you can sip on the same glass for hours. Notes of oak, cherry, and pure age. The lower ABV compared to earlier years really brings out some of the flavor notes for the more inexperienced palate. One of the best bourbons you can buy."

5.0,"So this might be a bit of bourbon nirvana for me, at least for this year.  There are cherries and raisins on the nose, as well as oak and a little bit of caramel.  The palate is amazingly coating but not oily at all.  That ethanol kick is there followed by some nice creamy butter.  I get raisin and cinnamon.  Reminds me of warm bread pudding.  A drizzle of caramel tops it all off.

The finish lasts for days. There is a hint of that signature boozy cherry coke, then it gets tart with an oaky dryness, but not one that takes the wind out of you.  This was a very, very good sip.  I do not agree with some of the reviews out there that point out the lower proof as compared to all other releases as a flaw.  I find it just enough to give you a big hug, and just low enough not to leave you gasping."

5.0,"This is the best bourbon I've ever tried. Absolutely outstanding! Beautiful nose, fills your whole mouth with flavor, and the longest finish I've ever experienced. The finish from one sip lasts 5-10min, it is insane! Also, the Kentucky hug is PERFECT, it's warm, but not hot and this is so smooth!"
5.0,"Oaky, spicy, dry... complex flavor with a great bite and oily texture. Great finish. Doesn’t have the punch of some of the high proof GTS, but the flavor is outstanding. Get yourself a pour."

4.75,"F ING Delicious... Typical Caramel, vanilla notes perfectly balanced with cherry, red apple, tobacco, and perfect amount of oak.  Get a little of the powdered sugar, think cause it’s just Yummy.  Chew this one around for a bit.  Everything you would expect, would give a perfect 5 but not quite the finish I had on other Stagg, though it’s still long.  Neck pour, look forward to seeing how this opens up."
3.0,"Good shit, slightly peppery"
3.75,null
4.5,Amazing balance and smooth. Could be hotter
5.0,"The color is a deep amber and coats the glass more like a curtain rather than legs. The nose is very oaky upfront with baking spices providing a very pleasant spiciness while caramel apple, powdered sugar, vanilla, brown sugar and rye round it out. The palate is very dry but rich and leaves you chewing on oak and vanilla while the sweetness from the nose is well tamed. Mild caramel and brown sugar present themselves while there is a rye spiciness holding everything together. The finish is long and spicy with lingering oak and vanilla and the rest of the palate melds together and fades nicely. Perfect."
4.5,It’s amazing. Enough said.
4.25,A taste with Jerad. Better than the 2018 in a blind taste test. Less proof brought out more flavor. Very good.

4.5,"Nose isn’t as nice as the taste. Finnish lasts forever. Lots of the flavors everyone says, better than the 2018, but not a 98/100 I’m afraid."
4.75,"Nose: Sweet vanilla, stone fruits - plums, dates.  Burnt brown sugar.  Crème brûlée.  Sweet floral character - honeysuckle.  Charred oak.  Very balanced, if forward, likely partially due to the proof.  Luxardo cherries.

Palate: Big brown sugar, vanilla, barrel and char.  Tannic - tons of texture and a good bite.  Slight creamy mustiness.  Bell pepper.  Black pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice.  Barrel bite, but in the best way.  Finish starts with a bright pop of ethanol and vanilla with baking spices.  As things come down, sweet creamy vanilla shows up.  The ending fade has nice depth and length with much of the same.  Medium long finish."

5.0,"Nose is sweet, rich and refined. Ethanol is gentle for the proof. I described it as “thick sweetness” because that’s the best descriptor I could come up with, and it’s fun to say. Vanilla, fruit, spice. Palette of honey, cherry, a tad bit of pepper and spices. The  barrel is there but is not overwhelming considering the age. Everything I like about Jr. in a more refined package. Finish goes forever. A little hit of citrus makes it feel surprisingly refreshing."
5.0,"On the nose, molasses and oak spice. The palate is RICH and complex. This is a perfect proof, definitely better than the Jr. Orange blossom honey is up front. Cherry compote-drizzled moist Mexican vanilla pound cake follows, and the oak is a close friend throughout. It’s light on char, heavy on spice and nutty notes, and that’s just fine with me. The finish lingered for over a minute and a half, and at full strength. It wasn’t like “This is reminiscent of what I just drank,” it was as if I were holding the bourbon in my mouth. Rich, deep, complex. Awesome bourbon, meets the hype."

Nose: salted caramel, home made snow cream, stay with me... cool whip on top of banana pudding.
Palate: all the spice in the world, super creamy
Finish: spicy and smooth, stays with you forever. Unlike Rose, Stagg never lets go."

4.5,"Finally popped this bad boy last night and pitted off against my current favorite Bourbon the Elijah Craig Barrel Proof A120 and Stagg Jr Batch 12 (the batch supposedly better than this)... It was a lot of fun! Before we dive into the notes some details on this one:

58.45% abv 116.9 Proof (lowest ever for a GTS)

15 years, 4 Months Old

Let's dive into the results and notes:

1) GTS 2019 - closer than expected but it's complexity and wonderful mouthfeel and finish make it a winner. It's packed with notes of fudge, vanilla, leather, cherries and mature oak. Definitely not the GTS we have come to expect but a much more restrained but ultimately rewarding experience.

2) ECBP A120 - this one is in the early running for Bourbon of the year under $70. It's hands down the best ECBP batch in recent memory. Unlike the GTS this one is big and brash. Lovely butterscotch bomb with brown sugar and an array of baking spices. A healthy dose of oak and long vanilla and dark chocolate finish. 

3) Stagg Jr 132.3 (Batch 12) the 2019 AWC Bourbon of the year finishes last and honestly is a pretty big step down from the ECBP IMO. A great Stagg Jr batch but it can't match the boldness, finish or depth of the ECBP. It's still fantastic just in very elite company here

Cheers All"

4.75,Strong woody (oak) nose with a candy sweet smell. Hints of alcohol and brown sugar as well. Taste is not as sweet as expected. No burn but some spicy/pepper qualities. Viscous oily mouthfeel. Long legs on the glass. Woody and maybe earthy taste with cherries or berries mid-taste. Long finish with oak and spice and hints of sweetness. I don’t feel the lower proof reduces the quality. Very enjoyable whiskey.

4.75,"This is by far the best George T Stagg I have ever had!  The nose opens up with burnt brown sugar, molasses, barrel spices and caramel corn.  One of the best noses if any bourbon I have ever had!  You still get the ETOH burn if you inhale too deeply but it’s still amazing!  The palate continues with toffee, caramel apples this time, barrel spices, deep oak undertones and that amazing burnt brown sugar.  The ETOH is undeniable but tolerable given the proof.  The finish continues with a whisp of smoke, spice, oak and those caramel apples.  This year’s proof was perfect!  Best BTAC OF THE YEAR and the best Stagg of all time!"

5.0,"It’s a BTAC!
Nose:  Cherry and rich oak. Leather almost mahogany.
Palette:  What all should be a bourbon... this is whisky of the year... sorry but wth?"
4.5,"I know this one caused quite a stir in the bourbon world with being the lowest proof GTS to date, by quite a bit at 116.9 proof. But let’s see how it really tastes...

The nose has incredible depth with caramelized fruits like cooked apples, strawberries and pears, rich dark caramel with some nice baking spices, oak, a hint of freshly baked bread and the pleasant aroma of old worn-in leather. 

The palate is sweet and fairly oily, with seem-bright red apples, caramel chews, oak spice, baking spices (cinnamon), nice leather. It tastes like it has some age, which it does! Very nice.

The finish follows through with the fruit notes and spices from the palate for a shorter side of long finish.

Man what a fantastic bourbon! I know some weren’t as happy with this release and argued that one of the Stagg Jr. batches (batch 12) from 2019 faired better. I’ll have to do a comparison, but for now I’ll have to disagree with that statement. As this one is very well balanced with a ton of depth on the nose and palate."
