4.0,The wine cask adds some depth but isn't overpowering.  A nice blend though may be hard to justify the expense.

This is some rough stuff.  Lot of burn!


In Two different blind tastings this scored last and second to last in both.  So disappointed in this.   Not worth the price or even $29 imo.  

Weller reserve, Evan William single barrel, Noahs mill, and whistle pig 10yr far surpassed this in the tasting."

3.75,"More wine on the nose than previous years. Smells of sweet fruit. Interesting palate, seems to go back and forth between thin and thick. Sweet, but gets dry and very spicy at the end. Another good showing for the Limited Edition line. 8/4/19"
