4.0,"Nose: Fruits with some floral notes. Nicely earthly and very sharp.

Taste: Dry with peppers. Some sweet spots in the mix as well.

Finish: A bit too short but nice and spicy. Tenderly smooth.

Balance: Easy dram, that is light in every step of the way. Even the spices come in a smooth package."

Proefnotities:
Lange afdronk achterop de tong, maar iets wrang. De afdronk trekt droog op de een of andere manier. Krijg behoefte aan water."

3.0,Quite enjoyed this one. A strong cereal impression in the nose but then a well balanced floral and spicy finish. Might be Oban's sharptongued little brother.

3.0,"westin paris with maurice, not peaty, fruity, similar to a japanese finish"
2.0,"Nose: this is a spirit driven nose with lemon, nuts and cleaning detergent (I know that sounds horrible but the nose reminds me of something I used for cleaning my kitchen). On the palate you find floral and fruity notes, citrus, some oak and marzipan. The finish a light and easy going but with a unpleasant bitterness. This a decent dram with a fair prize tag but it is simply a little boring for me, despite the nutty character. (74/100)"

4.5,"I dont know about you but i really enjoyed this one. Its all about balance and this one has it. 

Bottled at 43%abv, with and old gold color.

On the nose and on the palate is very straightforward, but it has a lot of balance and it is so delicious because of that.

On the nose main notes are: grapes, champagne, peat, salt, ginger, honey and milk chocolate.

On the palate, it is very common but so smooth on every aspect, starting with a caramel note, turning into a spicy peppery note to end in a hot but delicate aftertaste full of allspice. 

I got to say it is so simple but nice, i give this a 90 over 100. I might be exaggerating on this one, but what can i say, i enjoyed it."

2.5,"Bought on Tenerife and made it by an absolute accident. I haven’t been acknowledged with Knockando yet so I just gave it a try. 
Not to say it was a flop - for the money I paid it might be called a hit pretty much.
Very light and delicate both to the nose and to the tongue. But way too inexpressive in its taste - it fades away too quick. Some fruits, vanilla, spices but not too much.
The finish is short and gentle."

4.0,"This is a wonderful whisky, and the sherry cask is pleasantly prominent if that's your thing. Lemons, peaches and slightly toasted barley are evident on the nose, while the palate is medium-bodied with touches of chocolate and nutmeg. The finish is a little short yet pleasant  - I really think this scotch would have benefited from a higher ABV. Worth the try!"

4.0,"Very light colored. Not smokey at all, sugary taste and quick finish, quite the deal for the low price of 25€, and the wood packaging is gorgeous, what I would expect from a 70€ packaging..

Great deal for a light 12 years old whisky"
