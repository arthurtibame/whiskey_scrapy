2.0,Taste Smokey. Not a fan.
3.75,"Sight - A Gold copper look.

Nose - slight sweet caramel that runs hot with rye then a smoke that is gone as quickly as it comes.

Taste - A candy corn touch that turns like red hots but doesn't lose the sweetness.

Finish - A metallic finish that is oaky but over full bodied and nice.

Cheers and enjoy fellow drinkers! 😁🥃🥃"
