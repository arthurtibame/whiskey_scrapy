4.5,"The quintessential sherry bomb. 
The nose is intense, spicy and rich: mandarin oranges, almonds, raisins, wildflower honey, dried cherries, pipe tobacco
The palate comes in just as intense and rich as the nose: dates, figs, raisins, candied oranges, clove and allspice, cracked white pepper, woody and earthy peat undercut. The finish is drying, tannic, leather and sweet spice."
