5.0,"Drammers Club online pour, in fact only 1/3 25 year olds tried during the event along with a Murray McDavid sherry and burgundy cask and an smws 93.78 like a vintage dessert wine aged in a 2nd fill Oloroso butt. Great stuff even though my least favorite of the 3 25 year olds.

3.5,"I have tried a few in the Glen Scotia range including the 15, 18 victoriana and now 25. I'll say overall whilst a very pleasant distillery it isn't one that has made much of a lasting impression. the minor exception is the nas statement the victoriana which was a lot more punchy in terms of flavours. vanilla honey and green apple are the predominant flavour characteristics here , accompanied by a slight ethanol bent which makes it slightly out of kilter and makes for an average shortish finish."
4.0,"So we've driven 200 miles from Talisker Distillery to Loch Lomond after hiking near Glenbrittle on Skye. Beautiful day and why not round the evening off with a Glen Scotia 25 year old, around $75 for a double here at the excellent Loch Lomond Arms. 

Just what I needed - there is something about these Campbeltown boys'n'gals that imparts a subtle difference compared to other malts. 

The NOSE is just superb, very rich, fruity, with hints of candy, cinnamon, but also summer berries. The PALATE, first  I taste a huge burst of toffee- apple, then i taste almonds, finally summer-berries jam. The extra 7 years give it that additional depth to the liquid. The FINISH is body-warming as you would expect, gentle spiciness; it is long and delicious. Overall it brings on the mood of those summers we thought would never end, as you run and run to catch the sun but it's sinking! Delicious neat, perhaps 5 tiny drops of water at most -  recommended! :)"
