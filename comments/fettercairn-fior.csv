4.0,"Number 2 whisky in my new local whisky bar. Nose gives me toffee straight away, reminds me of Glendronach 15, taste not bad at all. Viscous on the palate, hard to distinguish more than toffee, runs hot for 42% but not bad not bad at all for under $60USD a bottle. Definitely my type of whisky. If i had to sum this up I'd call this a poor man's Glendronach 15. That's not an insult as its a different price point and I like it. Just doesn't have the flavour depth and alcohol balance is slightly out of kilt. High 3's rounding up to a 4 on value."

Naar de zoete kant toe

4.0,"Rich, dark color. The nose picks up notes of burnt sugar and malt. On the palate, there's a little smoke and a fair amount of spicy sweetness (rum-like, almost). The smoke lingers on the tongue, with a woody dryness."

5.0,Such a fun scotch to drink. Such an insane variety of flavors. At the price point it's by far my favorite. An adventure with every sip!
