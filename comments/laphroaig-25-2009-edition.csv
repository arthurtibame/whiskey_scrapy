4.5,"One of those incredible chances of scoring a hard to find (and pay) dram, is this laphroaig 25yo. My expectations were on the roof with this one, since i am a peat head and a fan of the distillery. Is it really worth it? Lets see.

Bottled at 48.9%abv.

On the nose is everything you expect from a Laphroaig: something that smells undrinkable. But you know that is a good thing, right?

Super medicinal, iodine, hospital, cloth softener, lemon air freshener and grapefruit are the notes i got on the nose. Citric and medicinal. The peat feels ""rested"". Perfect score here.

On the palate it is unique in some ways, bit this notes are not my preferred ones, so i deducted some points here, even if they are interesting: mint, herbal essences, green tea and grass. Very strange interesting stuff. Much too herbal. 

Aftertaste was too mainstream for a laphroaig, nothing new here, still a great finish: peat, earth, iodine, salt and smoke.

Overall i think this is a great dram bit i have had other laphroaigs, like lore or an cuan more, or even the three wood that are as good for three times less the price. This is not a super expensive bottle, but it is not cheap (around $350). My score for it is 93 over 100. Sláinte!"

4.5,"The color is a rich amber, just as you would expect sherry to be with legs that immediately coat the glass. Sherry dominates the nose, along with smoke, seaweed, brine, ripe fruitiness and a hint of straw. The palate is rich and smokey, filling the mouth with the traditional Laphroaig flavor, but much smoother than the usual, younger offerings. The sherry sweetness balance the peatiness perfectly with the two flavors blending so that they keep each other in balance. The finish is medium long with the mouth staying smokey while the fruit sweetness subtlety fades."
