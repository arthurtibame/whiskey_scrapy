2.75,Much better the second time I tried it. Had with ice. Very basic bourbon taste that’s a little sweeter than most. Not offensive and cheap. Needs ice and also a good mixer with ginger ale

3.5,"Nose: Light floral sweetness and black pepper.
Taste: super light mouth feel, light sweetness and pepper. Not too much heat. A light clean bourbon. Doesn’t blow up my skirt but there is literally nothing bad about it and for around $10 its not too shabby."

2.0,"Floral notes are most prominent, with slight pepper spices. Of budget bourbons it's one of the few to have such a strong tendency toward one flavor profile. But it's not the greatest execution."
2.0,(2.13.15) This is an old standby for me in mixes but I'm just getting around to a real review. This is very sweet and a touch of sour but pretty mild all around. Ice makes it even milder - I'm afraid I could drink it all night long on a bad night without ever tasting much except a buzz but luckily I just keep it around for a mixer and resealing my barrel for bourbon beer. Too much and you start realizing the earthy/mineral off-flavors in the background.

Plus you'll have money left over for therapy lessons after realizing you've been throwing your money away on bigger names."

3.0,"Color: Very Light Amber-
Nose: Mint, Cigar Boxes, Honey, Tobacco, Orange Zest-
Taste: Apricot, Cherry, Ginger, Pears, Nutmeg, Various Spices-
Finish:  Strong Fruitcake and Dried Fruit Finish, Nice fading burn

Very good Bourbon for the price.  The youth of the Bourbon (~36m) is apparent, but it still packs a very fruity, spicy, nutty punch (especially for an entry priced spirit).  Benchmark manages to deliver its payload without much of the chemical burn typically found in similarly aged (and priced) offerings. The dried fruit finish is very pleasurable. I was very surprised and impressed by this Bourbon, and would highly recommend it."
null,"Without offering my own formal notes, it's worth pointing out that Distiller's tasting notes are way off the mark here: as another user below points out, Benchmark isn't only a) made from Buffalo Trace's #1, low-rye mashbill, b) BT's #1 low-rye mashbill is one of the lowest rye content mashbills used by any bourbon maker, anywhere. Distiller's notes here would make a lot more sense for Ancient Age, which comes from the higher-rye BT #2 mashbill."
3.0,"My favorite of the budget bourbons. Corn, tobacco and leather on the nose, sweet palate with some citrus (orange peel?) and smooth finish with some more sweetness despite some roughness around the edges. In a blind taste test with friends, this showed well and was favored by all over Jim Beam White... most preferred it over Evan Williams Black, Jack Daniels, and Four Roses Yellow Label.

EDIT: I had posted a comment about recent bottles seeming milder/younger, but it was probably because I was tasting Benchmark after finishing off a handle of 90 proof Ezra Brooks (robust, and not particularly smooth or sweet)... I had Benchmark and Eagle Rare back to back this evening and was shocked at how close the $10 Benchmark came to the $30 Eagle Rare... yes, it lacked some of the ABV, barrel influence, and finish that helps balance Eagle Rare, but was very close and reminded me why I keep buying Benchmark at 1/3 the price!"
null,"It is absolutely hilarious to me that this review repeatedly mentions that this bourbon is ""high in rye"" when the Buffalo Trace mash bill #1 that this is based in has the least rye of any rye flavored bourbon that I know of."

2.0,"Benchmark Old No 8 @ 80 proof.   12.99 for 1 Liter
    
    Bottom of the shelf whiskey is bottom shelf whiskey,,,, yes or no?  Well ""maybe"" is the answer but one thing about these bottles that have been around for many decades, they have staying power for a reason, cheap and dependable if not that great is still delivering value. 
    
    Benchmark is an 80 proofer that drinks like a 90 proof, the black label belies the  content being a mid grade offering yet this bourbons taste has more in common with a black label Beam or Evan than the weaker white and green label brethren.   While there is nothing like a complexity of sweetness and woods or other flavors the bare bones of a bourbon whiskey stand up in notes of pepper carmels and oak just enough to pass as a slightly above bottom shelf white label bourbon. 
    
    The heat and burn are evident in the finish but nothing beyond what the proof would warrant and thus there is little or nothing in the way of negative flavoring to dissuade from follow up drinks.  While you wouldn't want to make Benchmark an every day drinker given what it is,  at the price it is a real value and thus deserving of recognition."
3.0,Unfinished taste but not horrible for the price
3.0,"Color: The color of this Buffalo Trace product is a polished mahogany wood.

Nose: The nose has basic notes of caramel, vanilla, and oak, but it also boasts unique subtleties like sour gummy worms and pine needles.

Taste: The palate matches the nose with oak, vanilla, and caramel notes with the addition of dark fruits like cherry and plum.

Finish: The finish is short to medium in length. The aftertaste is smooth with very little burn, yet much like Chandler in Friends during Thanksgiving, slight bitterness popping up at the end.

Opinion: I had heard good things about this bourbon from several people, but only tonight for a friend’s birthday did I finally pick up a bottle. Man, this bourbon sets a standard for budget bourbon! It was really tasty, really affordable, wasn't boring, and everyone at the party drank it neat and enjoyed it! I would highly recommend it to anyone! Buffalo Trace, well done and keep up the good work! Sláinte!"

2.75,"Well, for $9.99/bottle, I expect:  rot-gut, off notes, chemical and alcohol after taste, not to mention fake smoke undertones.  I did not find any of these.  After following the recommendation of Distiller members that I believe in, I picked a bottle up to make BBQ sauce with.  I did sample it prior to make sure I was not ruining a sauce.  I was surprised. It is no Blanton's, nor even Buffalo Trace's little brother.  However, it had floral sweetness, notes of vanilla and slight spice.  At 40% ABV, it's a neat dram, or a great base for mixing or highballs. It has now replaced Early Times as my sauce whiskey.  I know it only received a 70/100 from the pro evaluation, but I think I have spent lots more for much lesser pours. 2.75 stars"

As a reminder that my tasting notes on these a fairly subtle, but this is what I picked up.

On the nose I get that Buffalo Trace dark fruit note along with some baking spices, vanilla and a hint of rye.

The palate is light, which I would expect at 80 proof. I get a continuation of the nose with the sweet dark fruit dominating.

The flavors in the finish are gone pretty quickly, with just a mouth tingly light burn that last for a little bit.

Really not bad. I prefer this to some other bottom shelfers that I’ve tried recently including Old Charter 8, and Heaven Hill Old Style (white label)"

After you devour the liquid the American Oak attributes started to show up and you also get stuff like leather.

Its a medium finish to short finish that you still get your sugary icing on top.

I know a lot of people make cocktails with this, but I don't feel like it has enough depth and isn't bold enough to hold up well in a cocktail like a Manhattan or Old Fashioned.

Palate: Flat.  Not a whole lot there.  Very faint black pepper and oak, but overall not a lot of taste.  Surprisingly it coats the mouth well. 

Finish: Finish is actually pretty good considering lack of taste.  Finishes with a sweet burn - a Kentucky hug I suppose.   

Overall, not great, but not bad.  Will be on my shelf for friends who like to mix with a coke, but can’t see it being used for much else as long as I can remain employed.  Very much worth $10 though."

2.25,"Butterscotch and vanilla in your face on the nose, maybe even some vanilla cream cheese white cake? Taste doesn't hold up to the nose, though. Sweet but goes away almost immediately leading to a tongue and front of the mouth coating spiciness that seems to last a lot longer than what one would expect from such a low cost bourbon. Not on par with say an OGD spiciness but it's noticeable."
