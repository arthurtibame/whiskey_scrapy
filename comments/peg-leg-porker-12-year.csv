4.0,"A buddy had this one sitting on his shelf for a long while and finally decided to crack it! I have been itching to try it so was very excited... Before we dive into the notes let's examine what's in the bottle!

It's a 12 yr old Dickel sourced Bourbon that's filtered in Hickory charcoal versus Maple Charcoal (the same charcoal used to smoke the pork at the infamous eatery in Nashville)... It's bottled at 46.95% ABV... Let's dive in.. 

Upon entry you are immediately hit with oak and a dense red fruit note... Dried red fruits drizzled in Vanilla and some toffee.. baking spices follow with orange peel... The finish is a medium length and adds Cocoa to the oak and vanilla... Lovely dram!

My one criticism is the ABV screamed to be cask strength! It's definitely up there with the best Dickel distillate I have tasted just a tad tame...

Cheers All!"

1.0,"Smokey BBQ on the nose and immediately I know it's not my cup of tea, palate is pretty similar to nose, I'm sure a lot of people like this but it is not my jam

(Tasted at Bourbon Bastards, 1/23/20)"

4.5,"Very light nose.
Very oaky with some sweetness and peppery spice up front.
Balanced and caramel sweetness in the finish."

2.5,"Hickory smoke from the first sip. A little too smoky for my taste, especially at the price, but definitely a unique bourbon worth trying."

4.25,"Smokey flavor like a campfire, not a scotch. I like it."
2.5,Not very good. Just flat out. This is thin and has a funky flavor profile. Honestly smelled like urine. There are much better whiskeys out there for the money.

4.25,"I get a very slight pork taste, but I think it’s more of a hickory smoke I get with, more sweet and vanilla than I would have guessed. But very smooth with a nice spice in the end. Needless to say I poured another glass, it was worth it!"

4.5,Makes me crave a pulled pork sandwich.  Fantastic unique bourbon.
4.5,"This is a stellar bourbon.  I love barbecue though.  You can smell and taste fatty smoked pork.  Smooth, great mouthfeel."
