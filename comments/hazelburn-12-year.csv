3.5,"The nose is very malty with a big dose of salt and a hint of caramel and some oak.  I get some dry sherry notes, something like fino.

The palate is definitely light, with lots of biscuity malt at the front.  The flavor is light, but the texture is oily.  It's got a bit of a funky flavor, which I associate with Springbank, it's probably in part due to the sherry cask aging.  There is a pleasant saltiness to the whole package.  I get sherry notes in this, but they are dry - more like fino and not PX.  I get a bit of lemon zest, again likely from the sherry.  Something about the finish reminds me of yellow cake.

The finish is very astringent with some dry woody notes, but it's not ""licking a board"" woody.

This is not my favorite whiskey from the Springbank family, but it's definitely unique amongst their lineup.

It's one of the most malt forward scotches that I've had in recent memory."
2.0,"I swear, gets harder and harder to remember which bottles I've yet to review here. Will be nice once I finish reviewing my open bottles so I know they're all in here :) 

Nose - sherry is the first thing that comes to mind. There's that classic springbank element here, I know some have called it sulfer but its' something else. It's sparky, gives me a bit of a vinegar note, oak is a part of it. It's almost like going into a rickhouse where wine has been spilled over the oak, it's gone a bit sour, but then I get a buttery bread and caramel. 

Taste - There's a lot of oak on here, it might be the most oak forward springbank. The sherry I get in big ways on the nose is much more subtle here. I would guess a lot of the oak here is pretty tired and well used. It's sweet up front then turns bitter and given a bit sour, there's a bitter bite from oak tannin. The finish brings in some off sweetness almost an aspartame note (though it's not a bad thing as that note tend to be) and then it heats up on the mouth and brings with it more of the oak and sherry notes again. Just noticed but should note there's a bit of salt at the end I almost missed. Unpeated but I dunno, I get some elements of peat here all be it in low parts.

Hazelburn has been for me a weak spot in the springbank lineup (minus the oloros sherry 13 and 14 year bottles) and this is as springbank goes one of their lesser offerings. It doesn't drink like a 100+ dollar bottle of whisky. It is however complex as can be and frankly it's if not in the context of being a springbank, it's really good. Still I can't go over a 2.0 here. I would struggle to find who to recommend this one to. This is for someone who just wants to drink everything from Campbeltown of course I am most certainly one of."

3.75,"Nose: sherry influence is immediately apparent. Marzipan, figs, apples, sugar cookies, slightly grassy, cashews, a touch of funk

Taste:  follows the nose...marzipan, fig butter, apples, chocolate-orange, nutty, a bit of sulphur. 

Finish: this is where, imo, this whisky falls off. It’s short, a bit strident, and bitter with some sulphur notes and a touch of peatiness although this isn’t Peated. 

Not worth the MSRP of approx 90-95 dollars in the USA but I scored a couple bottles on Black Friday at a liquor store who clearly had no idea wth they were doing for $12/ bottle.  All in all, I’d say it was worth it."

3.75,"This is listed as un-peated but on the nose I certainly get a light puff of peat that mingles with sea spray, new rubber (like a bicycle inner tube), and a core of some sherried fruits including orange and pineapple. I found the fruits are nudged to the edge during the arrival with tingly pepper and salt to the fore. It develops into tart lemon, blood orange and grapefruit and a sherry dryness at the end. The grapefruit continues to round out in the finish which is also is a little peaty and spicy. The empty glass smells of tobacco and sawdust.

In summary, it was a very interesting 5cl miniature and my first Hazelburn. But not in the same league as the Springbank I have tried and not enough for me to consider getting a full bottle. However, I would like to try the Hazelburn 10 at some stage."

4.0,"The first impression from the nose is of one of my favorite granola recipes—baked with a touch of honey, orange zest, and coconut; the longer it sits the more spiceful it becomes, with a more careful nosing presenting notes of creamy banana and aromatic  sweet tobacco. If your nose leads you to believe you're taking a sticky-sweet and spicy sherried malt, the initial taste quickly recalls one's attention to the fact that this is the work of a seaside distillery—I taste notes of musty, sea-sprayed driftwood in addition to the crystallized ginger, more candied orange peel, treacle, and toasted Brazil nuts. The body is tart and wood driven and offers sweet and spicy overtones, being fruitier and less savory than its Springbank kin; this dram sports a hot, drying, and almost eternal finish. The empty decanter smells like the first whiff of fine tobacco, right after popping open the tin."
4.0,"The nose is a potpourri of green apple, caramel, cinnamon, vanilla and an odd-man out, rubber (cannot surely identify).  Arrives with some sweetness of brown sugar wrapped in a medium body.  As you explore, hints of, oddly, again, fresh cucumber  notes on the palate can be found    (at least for me).  A lovely finish with a tad of smoke paired with pepper spice.  A unique whisky I  tasted with a food pairing of Roulade of Sole, charred haricot vert, ""French onion"" crostini almond and smoke apple.  Very enjoyable.  [86/100][Tasted: 1/31/16 @ Eat Mosaic]"
4.0,"Super enjoyable, one of my favorite scotches so far. Smells smokey, buttery, oily, and like a dry wine. When you sip on this you taste those things exactly. A slight burnt oak taste takes over the tongue with a little lemon. Overall amazing and I want a bottle now. Thanks Kory!"

4.0,"Nose:  Oak, strawberry watermelon candies, celery, hint of smoke. There's a brightness to the nose.
Palate: Darker (older?) oak, strawberry watermelon candies, cantaloupe like sweetness through the finish, smokiness.
Add a little water to this one. '4.5'"

4.0,"I'm a huge fan of Springbank 12, and this – unsurprisingly – tastes like a smoother, less peaty version. As such, it's inherently a bit less interesting and alluring, but it's a finely made malt with a lot of Campbeltown character."
4.0,"Drinking neat: Floral, fruity, white cake, frosting, tobacco, lemon meringue, spice, young oak, honeydew melon, burnt sugar, dessert wine, cologne. A sugar sweet whiskey with a big glorious floral/melon nose. Somewhat short with a sharp hot finish. The nose is irresistible and I can't get enough. The taste is enjoyable but I can't say I'm blown away by it. It's worth trying but not buying."

3.5,"This triple distilled, almost Lowland-style variation of a Springbank malt claims to be unpeated. On the nose, there are orange zest, unripe apples and unexpected incense smoke. Hints of chocolate, dried fruits and marzipan indicate sherry cask influence. Arriving spicy and gingery, Hazelburn 12 tastes delicate and nutty with notes of roasted almonds, orange marmalade and coconuts. Traces of peat? Most definitely! The finish is of medium length, aromatic and oak-dominated. Altogether, an interesting but quite expensive Campbeltown Single Malt.
