4.0,"This has quickly become my go to American whiskey.  It’s $75-90 per bottle, and I haven’t bought myself a bottle yet, but I’ve probably had enough pours already that I could’ve bought a bottle.  Most whiskies bank on the nose, and gets weaker on the palate, and weaker still on the finish.  This is a rare dram that picks up intrigue from nose, to palate, to finish.
  
  NOSE: Out of the bottle, it comes at you like a feral dog.  Hot, spicy, nutty, and too oaky.  Put the glass back down.  It needs water and time.  On the do over, after 1-1.5 teaspoon water per ounce and ~10 minutes, it becomes more composed.  Vanilla, cinnamon, chocolate, rotting wood, cashews and almonds.  There’s a pickled smoke background.
  
  PALATE: Definitely wait until the nose settles before you try to sip.  There is a lot of rye spiciness, caramel, and chocolate on the arrival.  This is an aggressive whiskey.  A little bit sour, a little bit bitter, which balances well with the sweetness.  With more breathing time, it rounds into Macadamia and cranberry flavors.
  
  FINISH: Addicting.  As the sweetness disappears first, it’s mouth-drying and relentless with spiciness, bitterness, sourness.  But then the toasted barrels show their influence and the final notes are of the best boozy Indonesian mocha beans.  It lasts about an hour.  You can have one pour (drink responsibly!) at a restaurant and enjoy the aftertaste throughout the drive home.
  
  WITH WATER, WITH FOOD: You need to add some water to tame this dram.  I have found a lot of enjoyment using this as both an aperitif and digestif.  The tartness stimulates the appetite, and transitions well into game meats such as venison or quail.  By the time you are finished your meal, the remaining dram becomes more rounded.  The long toasted mocha bean finish is a very rewarding desert.
  
  MARK: 87/100"

Not much in the way of typical rye aromas or aftertaste but it does sport a luscious thick mouthfeel and lovely flavors of burnt sugar and orange rind. If you enjoy your spirits cask strength then you can add a star to my rating, but I like my whisky ready to drink."

4.0,"Given its proof, it is a little hot but not overly so. The nose starts with maple syrup, toasted almond and some spice. It ends with the tartness of a green grape and a little smoke. The palate continues with the toasted almond sweetness, some cinnamon, a little raisin and some heat. The finish has some smokiness and is fairly dry with some heat as well. The toasted almond remains but gives way to raisins again. The finish lingers a bit but gives way to the heat. Overall, a dangerously drinkable rye."

4.0,"The app's tasting notes are actually pretty spot on for this one, especially after letting it air for a bit. Roasted grains definitely dominate that palate at first, but not in an offensive way. Finish gets a bit disjointed in my opinion, with a lot of small flavors fighting for attention. Honestly, the aroma after sitting for a while is significantly better than the actual flavor."

4.0,"109.4 proof. Dark amber. Fresh linen on the nose, as well as deep caramel. Nose gets stronger and stronger. Smooth for the proof. Taste is interesting - an odd wood note. Mild sweetness. A strong but pleasant spiciness. This one seems like it'll develop. 12/22/17  108.2 proof. This is like a rye plus... something. It's very flavorful. 1/18/18"

5.0,"Dynamic, the wood flavor is excellent- it reminds me of when I would light marshmallow on fire and then blow them out before making a s’mores. Campfire smell and sweet taste, nice woody nose on my empty glass that I sniffed on for 10min afterward. If you’re a whiskey Diehard - you will absolutely love this. 

I was totally skeptical at first- I’m not Michter’s fan boy - However, this is fantastic-"

4.0,"To me, this noses better than it tastes. Not necessarily a bad thing, however, as it still tastes fantastic. I paid $99 for this bottle, and at that price, I would probably say it's a bit of a reach. I enjoy the High West offerings at $25+ less in price."

5.0,"Taste:  2 oz. neat in glen cairn.

Nose: (5.0):  Rich, chocolate, cherries, raisins, rye and cereal grains.  The nose is one of the best I have experienced.  It has that luxurious feeling similar to Thomas Handy.

Palate (5.0):  Chocolate coated cereal bar with cherries and raisins.  There is some char notes and a bit of a yeasty doughiness.  I am guessing this raw dough flavor might br a product of the second barrel entry. There is an excellent balance here between sweet and savory because of that.

Finish: (4.75)  Sweet and lingering.  It is short to medium.  Would have been 5 if it lasted longer

Overall: My favorite rye.  Michter's has a winner here.  The luxurious quality of the nose and finish is a byproduct of great care and the low entry to the barrel proofing (Michter's goes into the barrel at 103 proof.  This one came out at 109.4 proof!) which consolidates rich flavors.  My only problem-  hard to get and I only have 1/3rd bottle left."

4.0,"The nose is a wild ride. Starts off sweet cinnamon, and once it hits the back of your nose, it’s salty dill pickles, full nose tingle. Tastes like a mouth full of pastry. Not syrupy sweet like the toasted bourbon. My wife bakes elephant ears using puff pastry dough, and this tastes like an elephant ear that’s a little bit well done - not a ton of sugar, and what is there is browned and at the point right before it starts to burn. Rich mouthfeel. Two minutes after I sipped it, I was still getting dill pickles."

2.5,"Bought a pour of this over a sushi dinner this evening.  I have no idea why this was so much in demand, close to $150 /bottle in price, and so damn hard to find.  There’s dozens of others at a fraction of the price and much better. This has aromas of toasted rye bread with butter, and taste of dill ( MGP?), charred oak, and mint. Do yourself a favor—-save about $100/bottle and instead buy Whip Saw rye. This one simply lacks the complexity and depth for something that’s close to $150.  Drinks more like a $30."

Palate- Baking spices, wood spice, cherries, dark chocolate, creamy vanilla, fruity syrup


Finish- Long, thick finish with notes of dark chocolate, baking spices and vanilla


This one is good, but nothing too wild. Solid sipper, with nice rye flavors... but nothing is blowing me away. It’s balanced and flavorful, but it still leaves me asking for more. The nose is a bit hot, but after a bit of time it evens out. Nice thick mouthfeel with lots of emphasis of wood throughout."

4.75,"Neat. Neck pour. First thing I get is marshmallow.  Toasted marshmallow.  This is typical for me when it’s a double barreled bourbon.  Behind the marshmallow is a lot of bright notes.  Vanilla cream.  Macadamia nuts.  Pound cake.  Cinnamon.  It’s a decadent dessert.

Oh creamy mouth feel and absolutely jaw dropping on the palate.  Deep distinct flavors overwhelm the tongue.  Maple syrup.  Vanilla frosting on a cinnamon roll.  That cinnamon roll continues on the finish.  Like a Cinnabon from the mall.  The vanilla frosting lingers and lingers and ends with that double oak in the after taste.

It’s a cinnamon roll bomb to me right now. The vanilla frosting, the cinnamon maple syrup, the cake.  Delicious.  I was hyped for this purchase and it did not disappoint."
