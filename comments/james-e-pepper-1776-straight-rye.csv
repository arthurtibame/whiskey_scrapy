4.0,This is my 5th try at a rye and I found this one quite enjoyable. Very easy despite the 100 proof and the heavy rye finish I find pares very well with most meals.

4.0,A sweet and fruity rye the nose with citrus and slight barrel char. The palate is sweet with spice filling in riding through til the end. Not an overwhelming spice but plesant and warming. Just another example of how sourced whiskey can be done right.

4.0,"A new one at my local store. Bought it purely out of curiosity. Light straw color in the glass. The nose was a puzzler for me. There was a note there that I kept trying over and over to place. It was almost a wood polish or shellac note. Then...light bulb! Dill Pickle! I've finally found the pickle note that other reviewers keep mentioning in their rye reviews. LDI was the supposed source of most of those, but this one lists Corsair as the producer? Neat it has a very light sweetness, more dill and a short sharp, hot and peppery finish. Made a very good Old-Fashioned. At $35 I probably won't buy again (too many other good ryes now in the mid 20's) but might pick it up again if I see it on sale."

4.0,Not much flavor on the nose. Good bite and a hint of pepper.  Being generous with the score.
2.0,"Has the character to be a great mixer, but not a sipper. Unabashed alcohol on the nose, with hints of orange and lime?  Smooth sip with lots of floral and fruit that lends itself to a nice old fashioned."

4.0,"I've become a fan of the Scotch Test Dummies over the last year so, and they were fairly impressed at the quality of this young, high proof rye. I have to say that I am, too. The nose is classic rye - fresh cut dill, rye bread, baking spice, and some caramel. The palate is both spicy and sweet, with BIG notes of rye bread, cinnamon, clove, and a sweet caramel and vanilla finish."

2.75,"Nose (2.5):  Kind of boozy grape and some vanilla with a little spice.  Didn't do much for me.

Palate (2.75) Vanilla, grape, perhaps some dark chocolate, and a little spice.  Very oily mouth feeling.  I may have gotten a bit of coriander towards the end but that was it.  Seemed like it was a good idea that never came together.

Finish (2.75):  Kind of oily still.  Best way to describe finish for me would be rye bread drenched in a flat cherry coke. Again, there are flavors here but not put together well.

Reminded me of buying something and being excited to put it together, but when you get it home you find the essential parts are missing.  There are some flavors but it lacks cohesion."

Flavor hits the sinuses as of the wooden leg of a weather worn pirate thunking about the deck. Similarly destabilizing in the knees (what with being 100 proof). Set heading for the eye of the storm, and enjoy."
