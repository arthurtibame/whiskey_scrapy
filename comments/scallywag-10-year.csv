5.0,Delicious and balanced and complex. 85 is a crazy score for this. At least low 90s for this one.
3.75,Classic sweet sherry cask whisky. Find the classic Macallan orange note to shine through especially on the nose. Milk chocolate and bitter orange peel with a creamy viscous mouthfeel. Very good value whisky
