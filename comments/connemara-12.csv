2.0,"A very peaty nose led to high hopes, but to no avail. Palette is not very pleasant and not very deep. Late palette and early finish gives way to an intensely sour experience- lime like but not in a positive way. Finish is harsh. Unlike other whiskeys the finish is primarily in the nostrils as opposed to the back of the throat. At the very end there is an unpleasant gasoline like quality. I would not drink this again, probably."

4.0,A top notch melding of a light but serious Irish single malt and a healthy but not overpowering dose of islay scotch style peat. The peat is well balanced with the malty floral notes. Thoroughly pleasant

5.0,"Very complex - peaty, spicy, salty... so much going on here!"
4.0,Holy peat smoke Batman. The first notes on the nose & pallet are pure camp fire. After giving it a sworal in the mouth I find vanilla and carmal and a little spice. I'll set this one aside a while as I wade my way into the world of smoky scotch. It's much better neat then on the rocks.  I still prefer more traditional Irish like Tyrconnell.  OK it's been two weeks and I've decided to give this one another try. While I still find it to be very smokey it is smooth and easy to drink. There are a lot of flavors mixing around. Salty spicy some herbal notes. I'm starting to enjoy this more and more.

2.0,"I like peated whisky, I like Irish whiskey... but this is just a bad idea. The whisky first offers beautifully delicate and sweet Irish whiskey flavours, followed by a rather aggressive peat. It's as if someone put two whisk(e)ys together, but they never quite meshed correctly. The same distillery makes Tyrconnell which I think is better than this and I'd recommend Te Bheag and Johnnie Walker Black Label in a similar style. If it's a mix of flamboyant fruit and peat that you want, go for G. Rozelieures Rare."

3.0,"[Whiskey Live New York 2016] - More like a scotch wannabe Tyrconnel.  A Cooley whiskey for sure, but I don't understand the whole point of advertising it as a peated Irish whiskey if it isn't even going to try and pull it off well."

4.0,"Much better than the NAS version. It's not too often you get to try a peated Irish. I get those typical Irish flavors of green apple, but with the addition of anise, seaweed, and smoke--maybe a bit of citrus too. Slight bitterness on the finish. Not very complex, but enjoyable."

3.0,"Lightly peated with honey and faint notes of bubble gum on the nose. Delicate combination on tropical fruit (papaya) and smoke on the palate. Oak spice lends to a smooth finish, but it is relatively short. Overall, I would say that this is easy to drink, but also easy to forget on the shelf."
3.0,"What's that expression about putting lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig? Yeah... THAT. My continuous criticism of Irish whiskies is that they are, for the most part, the chamomiles of the whiskey world: something so dull you should actually have them before going to bed. There was absolutely NOTHING terrible or offputting about this expression. Really not. But it's dull. In fact, with the exception of the smokiness that's on the palate, it's actually quite difficult to tease out any aromatic compound.  That said, I recommend trying this whiskey for the sheer novelty of having a peated Irish whiskey, but good luck finding much peat here, or anything else other than smoke for that matter. Cheers!"

4.0,"Nose Sweet vanilla, wildflowers and bacon. Meat is more pronounced than smoke here.

Body- Bacon is prominent. Second sip gives you vanilla notes. 

Finish gives it grassiness that are like dried unsalted peanuts. I like that a lot. Shorter finish than Lagavulin (which it went against in our taste test) but a really nice, unusual scotch flavor profile.."

4.0,"not sure how much this costs as I'm sipping this one courtesy of a Flaviar sampler.  I like it.  It starts real sweat and peaty.  Peaty! vanilla! peaty! vanilla!! boom!!! it's screaming it at the top of it's lungs.  I get it!  The nose is warm and friendly.  That buttery hint of an aired out bourbon.  Not much going on though.  It's more in the sips, but it's not bad.  The taste lingers long enough.  Since I don't know how much it costs for a fifth, I'm going to guess this is somewhere between $30-$100, and I haven't drank a whisky in a long time so maybe I'm being generous or cheap.... if you're normally into Irish and about to try scotches this might be a perfect transition into the world of peatiness.."

Nose: Peat. Maybe molasses. Citrus. Maybe that’s cheese?
Taste: A bit dry, hard and harsh; somewhat hot and a bit herbal; not really malty; a bit oaky, peppery and salty; fairly peaty and spicy; smoky; a bit sweet and woody. I get an overwhelming sense of meat before swallowing.
Finish: The meat from the palate turns into smoke. It’s medium to long."

5.0,"If like me, you love both good Irish whiskey and peated, Scottish single malts, then this is the one for you. Uniquely interesting flavour profile for an Irish. Peated, but not overly so, delicate flavours combine to give an Irish taste experience similar to that of a top shelf Japanese bottle. Only snag is the price point, have never seen this drop below £55 not inc. delivery, so perhaps a small price cut for overseas customers would help spread the word on this one. Unfortunately, very hard to find anywhere in England. Tasted for the first time in Cork City."

4.0,"Very intense aromas of many things - floral, seaweed, peat, pear, it is multidimensional but a bit too perfumed.

On palate, honey, coal, coffee and smoke come out along with those flavours we got in the aromas. It is overall sweet but it has some darker elements that make it tastes a bit more mature.

The finish is dark chocolate with coal. This is quite an interesting whisky with many flavours, but I may prefer something more harmonic and balanced."

3.5,"Thanks to Flaviar, I got a tasting sample of this. First off, I hate peat as I've tried many peated scotches, but oddly I do not mind this whiskey at all. Maybe my pallete is changing or there is less peat smoke. Its an odd mix of sweet and meaty smoke, but it works. Letting it sit for about 10 minutes before enjoying really brought everything together. 

A nice vanilla cream and honey with an earthy and almost meaty smoke backbone."

3.75,"The expert review mentioned Japanese nori. I did not know what that was until I looked it up. It's dried  seaweed sheets like what are used to wrap sushi. My wife and daughters love that stuff and will eat it with tuna and mayo. Now that I know what it is, I can confirm that I get that on the nose too, along with peat, vanilla, bicuits, a hint of damp camp fire and iodine, all mingling in a strange potpourri. It's slightly silky on the palate with with some honey, vanilla, nori, sea salt and raw peat. The finish is medium length, with all the flavors interplaying until the end. It's, interesting, different, strange, weird, and I think I love it."

3.0,"Visually very clear. Aroma is that of peat smoke with a hint of sweetness. The first taste definitely has the rubbery peat taste. Adding water sweetens the taste. 

I don’t think I’m giving up smoky scotch like Talisker for this."
