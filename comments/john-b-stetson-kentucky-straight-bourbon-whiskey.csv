It's very weak, light colored and the taste barely passes for bitter alcohol. You would be better off drinking ginger ale."

3.75,"This is a difficult bourbon to explain. From what I read on the bottle it is a straight Bourbon Whiskey but it is aged less than 2 years so I am not sure what to make of that. The liquid inside is surprising in that I was expecting a Texas-style in your face bourbon instead I found a very smooth, easy sipping bourbon that had all of the characteristics of a Wheat Bourbon. This is one of the smoothest drinking bourbons I have had in a long time. It rivals W.L. Weller for smoothness and is better than Makers Mark. It is a light tawny color and has a bit of ethanol on the nose along with vanilla and a slight touch of oak. The body neat is just gentle sweetness maybe sugar cookies or the old-style tea cakes my grandmother used to make but not super sweet. The finish was warm with another touch of wood. It is listed on the site for $30 and I found it at a Specs in San Antonio, TX for $18 and at that price I will continue to buy it. If the flavors continue to hold up for making cocktails this may become my everyday bourbon. It is a very smooth bourbon and a great price."
2.25,"Sweet and citrus aroma, adding in vanilla and a splinter of wood through the taste. Harsh alcohol notes softening eventually to a relatively pleasant afterglow. A bit rough."
