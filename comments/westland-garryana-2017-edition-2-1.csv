4.0,just barely a 4-star offering. classic single malt nose. the garryanna adds an almost bourbon-like sweetness which coats over the slight sourness in the palate. a solid dram that's almost great.
3.25,"Nose - (w/o water) Savory sweet, sweet candied ginger spice, light caramel, bananas, sweet nuts (w/o water) not much change, just a tiny bit more muted

Taste - (w/o water) Ginger/chili spice/tingle, sweet savory meaty sweetness, sweet nuts, bananas, toasted barley, hints of chocolate, bit thin (w/ water) Less spice, more metallic, more bitter nut skins, weird savory sweet jerky

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering white pepper tingle, sweet caramel, chocolate, banana walnut bread, light metallic notes (w/ water) Less tingle, more metallic finish, banana walnut chocolate bread

Score - 73/100

Final Thoughts - This was an interesting one in that it had what I think is the meaty notes from the garry oak combined with the sweet youthful malt that Westland has. Having done the distillery tour, I've had a chance to try some of the toasted barley & it really comes through in the spirit here. This is unique for sure but the flavor combinations & metallic ending notes just aren't for me.

Would I drink it if offered? - No

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

5.0,"I had this at the distillery in Seattle ( which by the way is a fun  visit).  It’s interesting to see that this was aged in Garryana oak, which is native to Washington and Oregon, and also is regulated under law from being cut.  Which means that the barrels have to be made from trees that fell.  Less than 4% of Pacific Northwest trees are of these garryana, and it only grows in a small part of Washington and Oregon.  The wood imparts a strong overpowering flavor, which forces it to be mixed with other whiskey aged in new oak or used bourbon.  Nose:  strong vanilla, much stronger than bourbon.  Flavor is complex and deep.  Almost heavy in feel, as if you’re having a syrup.  Really well made and highly recommended."

5.0,it taste so complex and also you could feel the difference at start and finish three different oak on your mouth
4.0,"Silky aromas of caramel, vanilla and oak. Deliciously creamy toffee flavors. It's somewhat reminiscent of the Macallan Edition 2, and perhaps a notch better. This is the first Westland malt that I have really enjoyed and much better than last year's edition. There is promise yet in this distillery!"

5.0,"Westland Garryana 2|1 delivers in great depth, complexity, and precision and gets you excited for the future of Westland Distillery. 

First off, the nose is incredibly enticing offering rich vanilla, honey, caramel, oak, sawdust, pie crust, cherry, and even a mild hint of papaya. All this gathers amidst a creamy epicenter.

The mouthfeel is full bodied and the description of stewed meats is accurate as the fullness eludes to a bit of iron and spicy bourbon accompanied by black pepper.

The finish stands out as long lasting and that’s surprising coming from a dram on the younger side. The heat resonates as the last notes diminish over a few minutes. Garryana, arrives bold and leaves bold. 

Westland’s offerings tend to be a bit pricy, but this one rides the fence of fully worth it and out of reach. This expression however does an amazing job of leading you to one of those sides. It knows what it is and offers no excuse. There’s none needed.
