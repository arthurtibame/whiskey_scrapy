3.0,"A very faint complexion indeed indicative of a dram lacking a little in character. A no-frills flavour profile with light grassy herbals, medium white pepper heat and an occasional diesel note that gives way to a gentle malt finish. Perhaps a hint of lavender or custard but little imparted from the oak. So 'clean' there's little expression."

Ultimately pleasant but nothing to get excited about. Easy drinking but nothing to write home about."

4.0,"A lovely, sweet dram. I appreciate the fact that it is not chill filtered and has no caramel added. It adds authenticity to this. It's an easy going, Speyside and is not trying to be anything it obviously isn't. The very light colour can be off putting to some but again it lends this dram an air of simplicity and of confidence that it will succeed in satisfying someone reaching for a light, enjoyable experience. I do find the bite to not be in line with my mood when I am reaching for this type of whisky. A few drops of water take that edge off and serve to centre the experience. Not entirely memorable but great at what it is and solid value."

4.25,"Love it!! 
You have to work a little to get the best of it but it’s so worth the time and attention. 
This is a grossly under appreciated gem.

Nose:
Crisp pears
Delicate ragweed and lantana
Almost smoky but more floral herbal incense
Vanilla
Floral lemongrass
Light bread and honey

Arrival:
Dense but soft flavour for the first few seconds
Fairly sweet and nectar like
Citric acidity develops
A little green chilli 

Development:
Starts showing it’s intensity at this point
Grapefruit zest
White pepper
Tiny hint of herbal mulch

Finish:
Fresh cut hardwood
Sauvignon Blanc style juicy, straw and gentle spices
Finish lingers with a range of medicinal herbs

If your a gin sipper I would say this is a good introduction scotch for you. A lot of the same characters show up in the bitter herbs and citrus notes. This is where you go once the gin trail gets a bit boring."

I hate to say it but most people are right when they name this scotch one of best entry level 12yo scotch whisky on the market.

Besides, and this is of the utmost importance, i am in total awe of the design of this distillery's bottles and labels. Good job Stranger & Stranger!"
4.0,"Representing speyside isla river

Nose: light, fragrant, nutty, a very mild bourbon-y vanilla and toffee, winter spice, caramel, candies nuts and maraschino cherry a really nice nose. 

Body: full bodied, no joke!

Palate: spice is nice, can taste the bourbon cask sweetness and heat, it’s really nice. MJ notes mixed fruits. 

Finish: medium and warm

Note: I like this one, it’s my kind of scotch hot and sweat, it’s not terribly complicated just a real nice dram. MJ called this finish short but sweet and pleasant with a palate that is minty (?) with nice balance. This is my jam!"

On palate the nuts continue, but have some vegetable notes and a bit smoky too. Light in flavours, but rich in texture. The finish is medium length of tobacco.

A decent surprise at the quality of this relatively affordable bottle. Definitely recommended for your shelf for a light but flavourful speyside."
