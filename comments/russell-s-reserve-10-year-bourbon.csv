3.75,"Nose: peppercorn, butterscotch, vanilla

Palate: very close to the nose with some added maple syrup sweetness

Finish: short to medium, with some extra cinnamon spice 

A creamier, vanilla-forward take on the traditional Wild Turkey. And at 90 proof it sets between the 81 and 101 varieties. Always a good supply and the price point is great for a 10-year aged traditional bourbon."

4.5,"Russell's 10 was one of the first whiskies I ever bought that can considered above entry level. At the time, I knew nothing of the nuances and complexity of a whiskey, so this bottle has been a new experience for all and intents and purposes. The label has changed, but I won't be able to draw on my past experiences to determine if the bourbon itself has changed.

Nose: Very sweet and oak-driven. Red apple, cotton candy, caramel, vanilla, almond, brown sugar, and new car leather jump immediately out of the glass. Behind that I get toffee, cinnamon, clove, baking spice, cherry, and dry red fruit fruit. Loving it already.

Palate: More of those caramel, vanilla, almond, brown sugar, red apple, toffee, and cotton candy notes. It's initially sweet, but ramps up into a spice-bomb on the mid-palate. Cinnamon red hots, black pepper, baking spice, clove, and ginger. And of course, oak. The nose is sweet and leathery with spice in the background, whereas the palate is initially sweet and becomes spice-forward midway through. I read wintergreen somewhere. I can get behind that. There is definitely some mint in here. Very good.

Finish: Moderate to long. Surprisingly long for a 45% bourbon. Some cherry and red apple sweetness that quickly fades into a combination of ginger, cinnamon, and oak spice. I really enjoy the ginger notes I've been finding in WT products.As it bows out, I pick up more of that wintergreen and some black tea leaves.

I'm continually impressed with Wild Turkey. They have my favorite sub-$25 whiskey (WT 101). They have one of the best bang-for-buck Barrel Proof whiskies out there (Rare Breed). And now this. This stuff kicks ass. In terms of value, I put this one right up with Eagle Rare. Both 10 year, $40 bottles that outclass most things many bottles that are double or even triple the price.

For $40, I think this is a must buy. I will definitely keep this one in the rotation. Major points for VFM. Wild Turkey is a dark horse distillery, often written off because of the lackluster reputation of its flagship WT 81. WT wins with a combination of quality and value. And the RR10 is a great representation of these two qualities at work. Well done, WT."
2.0,"While this bourbon is okay, it’s not nearly as rich as Eagle Rare 10 or Bulleit 10. I honestly have a hard time picking out that this bourbon was aged 10 years. It’s pretty light-bodied and has some good nutty flavors (cashews primarily). It also has classic bourbon flavors of vanilla and oak. However, 10-year-old bourbons usually have an excess of those flavors due to the longer time spent in the barrel. This is a good bourbon if it was $20. But I must say I’d rather spend the extra money to get Bulleit or Eagle Rare because those taste more special."

3.75,"Nose: Rich oak, butter toffee, vanilla creme over warm berry cobbler.

Palate: Powerful waves of dark chocolate, creme brulee, vanilla extract. Dark thick maple syrup comes through with an oak punch. The tail end carries the warming spice of clove and cinnamon, before fading into a longer lighter menthol finish.

Thoughts: This is warm toast with cinnamon sugar and butter. The mouthfeel is super rich and oily. The finish lingers on and on, it's warm, sweet, and just the faintest amount of spice. It's cooling and warming all at once. There are more and more bourbons that cost far more than this while giving you much less. If you're ever looking for a nice gift for a bourbon fan, this is a great choice!"

4.25,"Hot damn! Age statement bourbon!

As I’ve gone further down the scotch rabbit hole, I find myself drinking less bourbon these days, but this puts a smile on my face. Seems like there’s so many bourbons on the market these days and it’s hard to stand out among the crowd, but this one is worth looking at. 

Wild Turkey gets a bad rap. They make a quality budget whiskey (101), have intriguing promotional offers (Longbranch), and now this. No reason to diss on that. 

The nose is my favorite part. It reminds me of the mixture I make for Hot Buttered Rum (minus the rum), with butter, brown sugar, and baking spices. Classic bourbon notes on the palate with an emphasis On the vanilla (I suspect from ten years in the barrel). Finish is long, warming, and even though it’s still summer in Texas, it makes me feel like I’m back in Colorado on a snowy winter morning. 

Good stuff. Well crafted. Highly affordable. Most recommended."
4.25,"Coming back to this after a week. The nose has really opened up: banana, vanilla, baking spices, leather, corn, hints of raisin 

Palate: creamy but drier than the sweetness of the nose would lead you to believe. Rich and balanced 

Finish: medium, with the zest and rye spice kick coming in nicely here. Nice experience from start to finish. 

Some years this 10-year shines. This one definitely rises above the bottles I had from last year’s batch in my opinion."

4.5,"This is a nice 10-year bourbon that has some well stood out notes. On the nose, you get a nice barrel spice mixed with strong vanilla and cherry. Underneath this, you get a nice orange zest note mixed with rye spices, more oak, cinnamon, and maple brown sugar. The taste hit immediately with the cinnamon and vanilla cream. The finish has more oak and fruity undertones from the cherry, citrus, and a light red apple that is stronger on the palate than on the nose. The finish is moderate with mostly a spicy cinnamon-sugar / vanilla left over. This bourbon is not amazingly balanced but if you like bourbon with spicy rye and oak characteristics along with strong vanilla this will be a standout.

Last note: I have been putting this bourbon in multiple blind flights and it is beating out higher proof bourbons. The flavor density at 90 abv is outstanding."

3.5,Nose is okay and spicy.  With some vanilla.  I read butter in the reviews but I don't find it.  Smooth and sort of hot with like allspice or nutmeg?  but oakey sweetness hits with corn and eases the heat out rather quickly.  Warm Maple syrup on the finish for sure.

3.0,"The scope of Wild Turkey's operation is hard to put into words that would do it justice. From the two giant silos of grain that the distillery goes through a single week, to 24 fermenting tanks each holding 30,000 gallons, and the enormous column still 6 feet in diameter that takes one week to shut down and another week to fire back up. It's one thing to read about it or see pictures, to only see it in person and be absolutely blown away by the size of it all.
Wild Turkey has only one bourbon mashbill but is able to put out 10 different labels regularly, which is pretty crazy. It is 75% corn, 13% rye, and 12% barley.
Russell's Reserve 10 Year is the next step up in price from Wild Turkey 101.
On the nose there's cinnamon and roasted almonds with a bit of apricots. On the palate you get a little bit of honey and vanilla, a hint of earthy notes, and lots of oak. Towards the finish, that oak taste starts to turn to resemble something similar to lacquered wood which took me a bit to appreciate. The flavors change as the finish continues for quite a few minutes it seems like. There is vanilla with burnt brown sugar and cinnamon and thick, surypy mouthfeel.
The more I drink it the more I start to appreciate it. At less than $35 per bottle, it's getting harder and harder to find bottles that pack as much flavor as this does."

3.25,"Fantastically smooth.

Nose is pretty basic. Rich corn (not sweet, rich. Give it a nice rub in the hand and its hard to miss), milled oak slab. Interesting balance between the usual Kentucky regulars and sweetness makes itself known.

Palate is balanced but simple. Something about the oak notes here lets you know this has some serious expertise behind it. Cinnamon red hot candies, apples, and a present-yet-tame maple finish make it fantastic just all by itself.

I recently read Jimmie/Eddie and the majority of ""old skool"" types at Turkey like their brown neat and it definitely is reflected in this profile.

The mouth is a serious treat. It goes down like butter. 45% is just right for this one even if we lose some nuance."

3.75,"This bourbon is very highly regarded across the web. Here there is a little less enthusiasm with some reviewers a little disappointed. Regardless I love WT 101 so I had to try this. Poured neat, glossy leggy coating on glass. Noses dark caramel, bit of nutmeg and that dusty hazy WT spice so many of us enjoy. Palate has creamy toffee, some cinnamon, and more spice with oak and light char. There is no concern with heat as this is silky smooth. The extra time in the barrel has mellowed any aggressiveness. Finishes with caramel fade, cinnamon and oak/alligator char. The finish is the sticking point for many. It is drying and moves out a little quick. I just hold it longer and chew on it and much of the astringency dissolves giving a better finish( still not long though) . The thing is this stuff is eminently drinkable with great flavor, watch out or look up and half the bottle is gone. Its 101 sent to finishing school, refined and under control. This is Austin Nichols version of Woodford Reserve. Something a little upstream but not too expensive. Im a huge fan of the brash, bold flavorful 101 and might choose its value over this but there is no denying RR 10 is excellent bourbon 89/100 . I would purchase again as its around $30 in my area. Many will prefer this for lack of heat and fact that its one of the easiest drinkers out there(its like butter) I would recommend this to someone looking to try bourbon as its very user friendly"

3.25,"Context: First drink back after a month-long dry stint of not consuming a single drop of alchohol [long story]. Not sure if I was getting back on the horse or off it. Either way, glad that social experiment is over...for now.
I promised myself I would drop more detailed reviews moving forward having considered my previous reviews to be in the “palate-building” phase of my whiskey journey. Thus, I tasted a bunch of “entry-level & bottom-shelf” stuff with exception of a couple not-so-entry-Level” [read LagaV DE & Laph 10] on my way to expanding my palate. So feel free to take those reviews with the proverbial “grain” of salt (no whiskey pun intended). For those reviews,  I focused purely on what I liked and what stood out the most, without detailed tasting notes. Henceforth however, with my palate “foundation” squarely established, I venture into the more nuanced arena of detailed reviews,  albeit with  an “Anthology” twist. My mum (& high school teacher) always said that whatever is worth doing, is worth doing well. So...here goes:
First Nose : Toasted cereal, right up front. I haven’t checked the mash bill on this but if I was a betting man, I would put chips on a very high corn bill, at least 75%
More Nose: Faint vanilla extract, severely burnt caramel and dark-roasted peanuts. Slight alcohol burn, which is surprising given the relatively lower proof (Read: NOT cask strength)
Front Palate: Follows closely with the nose...more cereal, very much grain-driven.
Mid Palate: Classic bourbon notes of vanilla with some burnt  caramel following but so muted and almost unnoticeable that I wonder if I’m imagining it out of anticipation. The grain is very prominent! I also picked up charred peanuts. 
Finishes with a slight bitter aftertaste (with ice)
All in, solid bourbon but was expecting more for the age. It’s possible Eagle Rare 10 may have set the bar a bit high for entry-to-mid level 10yr old bourbons. Since this is not as good as the ER10 (IMHO), which I scored a 4⭐️, I bestow upon this here bourbon, a 3.25⭐️. For some reason, I have a nagging feeling that this will grow on me and get up to a 3.5 / 3.75 by the time it’s all said and done. Maybe it’s because I have a few WT products yet to be explored. Need to keep hope alive and room for improvement. That said, I stand by my initial rating. Time will tell. Check back at the half bottle mark."

3.5,"This is one of my favorite daily drinkers. Readily available, 10-year bourbon with a great flavor profile. The nose matches the palate, with sweet notes of cinnamon and brown sugar along with hints of vanilla extract. The profile is not overwhelming but very tasty. The finish isn’t long or lingering but it stays consistent with the palate, adding notes of oak and sweet corn to finish. Not the most complex but a great flavor profile that is consistent, and wonderfully relaxing to hang your hat on at the end of the day."
4.0,Picked this up because I found it for $29 and you can’t beat that for a 10 year bourbon. Nose is dried fruit with sweet notes. Palate is smooth/sweet and dangerously so. I call this the sneak attacker. Finish - you can pull some fruit out but the longer it sits you can also get a faint cinnamon profile at the very end. Short finish is the only knock here but for 90 proof it is very enjoyable. Verdict: I would buy this again. Have the single barrel on the bar and this makes me excited to pop the top on that one soon.

3.0,"Interesting bourbon, flavorful and smooth on the pallet, but rather hot finish. Floral bouquet with hints of butterscotch and smoked orange. Soft mouthfeel with ample caramel, mild coriander, and orange peel. Palatable infinitely with softness and subtle black pepper, but swallow and the heat flares incredibly. This is not harsh, but also not faint."

3.5,"Nose - sweet orange and cherry, vanilla, muted cinnamon, oak, caramel/toffee, butter frosting. 

Taste - mild cinnamon, cocoa, very oaky, coconut, sweet while in the mouth, finishing woody and sour.

This bourbon is good, although I feel the oak overpowers the more subtle, complex flavors. I’ve tried this a few times now and found that it really opens up with a few drops of water and some extra time to air before drinking it. The aromas you get on the nose really begin to come through."

Taste: spicier and more peppery in taste, not feel, than most bourbon I’ve had. Oak is the mid flavor, and after the slight burn wears, there’s a note of banana that I get. Oak"

3.5,"BACKGROUND: Russell’s Reserve 10 Year Bourbon is produced by Wild Turkey Distillery, which has an interesting origin story.  At the end of the American Civil War, the Ripy Brothers, James and Thomas, returned to their native state of Kentucky and opened a distillery in Lawrenceburg. 

Following the repeal of Prohibition, Thomas McCarthy, an executive with whiskey wholesaler Austin Nichols, took some samples of maturing bourbon from the distillery's rickhouse on a turkey hunting trip with a group of friends. The following year, his friends asked him to bring ""some of that good wild turkey whiskey,"" so the the distillery and its bourbon were later renamed Wild Turkey after the Austin Nichols company purchased them.

Many notable figures throughout history have been devoted Wild Turkey aficionados, and among them are former presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Lyndon Johnson, screen legend John Wayne, gonzo journalist Hunter Thompson, and legendary daredevil Evel Knievel, who carried a hollow cane filled with the bourbon.

Since 1954, Wild Turkey Distillery has been operating under the guidance of Master Distiller Jimmy Russell, and, in 2015, Russell’s son, Eddie, was promoted to the same title, which made them the only father/son master distiller team working side-by-side within the industry.

Russell's Reserve 10 Year Old Bourbon was first introduced to the market by Eddie Russell in 1998.  The bourbon is aged for at least 10 years in virgin American oak casks that have been charred with the strongest #4 “alligator char,” which makes the inside of the barrel resemble the pattern of a gator hide.

Each batch of Russell's Reserve 10 Year Old Bourbon is made from only a handful of casks, each of which is personally selected by the Russells from the choice center cut of Wild Turkey's rickhouse.

Russell's Reserve 10 Year Old Bourbon earned the Double Gold Medal at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition in 2011.  In addition, it earned a score of 95 points — tying Pappy Van Winkle's 20 Year Old Bourbon — at the Ultimate Spirits Challenge.

NOSE: As one would assume from a bourbon aged for a decade, the nose is dominated by oak, which is followed by scents of dark molasses and nuts that instantly bring pecan pie filling to mind.  Some citrus follows along with just a bit of banana that is more reminiscent of Brown Forman products than Wild Turkey.  The nose also carries the unmistakable smell of age that I have often likened to the odor that engulfs you when first entering an antique book store.  I would take a bath in this nose if I could.

PALATE: The palate, like the nose, is consumed by oak and large flavors of citrus.  Some maraschino cherry sweetness peeks through from time to time.  Vanilla and some soft caramel round out the palate.  

FINISH: The finish is, once again, oak-heavy, but barrel char is more obvious.  A firecracker pop of rye spice is followed by an abundance of mint, almost as if you’d eaten a roll of peppermint Life Savers.  The finish is not a long one, but it also does not carry the backend bitterness or oak tannins that many well-aged bourbons possess.

FINAL ASSESSMENT:  I have often said that dollar-for-dollar and sip-for-sip, Wild Turkey products are among the best values in bourbon today, and at around $40 a bottle, Russell’s Reserve 10 Year certainly adds solid evidence to that claim.  

With that said, I much prefer the Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel, which carries a higher proof and a price point that is about $20 more, but the 10 Year is a pleasing alternative."

4.25,"Nose: Vanilla, brown sugar, and oak.  Maple - imagine a maple donut from your favorite local shop.  Under-ripe bananas, peaches.  Rye spice just barely poking through as cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove.  Peanuts - roasted but unsalted.  Sweet naval oranges.  Dense and rich, but not overpowering or excessive.

Palate: Classic bourbon - vanilla, brown sugar, and oak.  The maple has turned down while the citrus is punching through some more.  Creamy - for some reason I'm reminded of the orange Creme Savers from a while back.  Flashes of wintergreen and mint.  Fruity - strawberries, blueberries, and peaches.  Some tannin here, but in a very balanced way.  Barrel and char, too.  Medium-light mouthfeel.  Finish begins with a a harmony of vanilla, fruit, and barrel notes.  As things settle in, some alcohol brightness, mint, and cream start pushing through in a surge of flavors.  Then a really appealing sweet citrus oil and honey note shows up, along with this backbone of tannin and oak.  The fade-out is a dance between cream, orange, vanilla, honeysuckle, and oak.

Other notes: The few things I've had so far from Wild Turkey have impressed me.  The 101, the rye, and this are all excellent at their respective price-points.  Though my bourbon preferences tend to lean into the cask strength end of the spectrum, this demonstrates what a skilled master distiller is really capable of with lower proofs.  I almost want to say I wish I could have this at barrel strength, but I also feel like the balance going on here would get destroyed in the process.  This fits a similar profile as Knob Creek, but heads into a more fruit-forward direction, while KC leans into the barrel.  Really appealing overall."

It was brought to my attention by someone who is more experienced in bourbon than I, but I found it to be a bit more acetone than I was expecting. I taste more alcohol  than anything else. 

The nose and palette are overwhelmingly alcohol and spice. At first taste I thought I had a rye. but the finish and shortly after that is very pleasant. Caramel or brown sugar, I can't tell which , but a warm rich flavor is present after you swallow. Prior to that, it's just spice and burn in my opinion. 

Coming from the Four Roses Single Barrel to this one, the Russell just falls so very short."

4.25,"Over Memorial Day Weekend, I did some social distancing by having a blind tasting at home. My wife poured four samples of Henry McKenna BiB, 13th Colony Sour Mash Bourbon, Very Old Barton BiB, and Russell 10yo. The tasting was very fun and very informative. While the Russell did not win it nearly did. The flavors were very pleasant the color is dark amber and coats the sides of the glass nicely. The nose is sweet and not just a little sweet. I smelled vanilla, caramel, or toffee were right there when you first inhale. The body is amazing the sweetness mellows quickly into a holiday like taste with some spices like cinnamon or nutmeg. The flavor lasts a long time and it is great. I was very impressed with how long the flavors were in my mouth and while there was some heat the burn was not harsh. This is a quite robust 90 proof bourbon and was very surprised when compared to higher proof Bourbons. I will continue to have this in my bar. Enjoy."

Nose - cherries is the first thing that comes to mind. Sweet cherries with a vanilla backend and some light cinnamon

Taste - sweet and smooth to start and a very light burn to finish. Vanilla with a slight charred oak. Some may say this has an odd aftertaste but personally I like it.

Overall and value - 10 year bourbon made from master distiller Eddie Russell and readily available around 30-50$. Definitely some value in this bottle under 50$ and even better when found on sale. It’s a good tasting bourbon with a great nose. Overall it’s a must buy"
