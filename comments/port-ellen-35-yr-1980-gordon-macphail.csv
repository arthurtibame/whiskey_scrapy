3.75,"I used to frequent a whiskey bar in another city when I was down there for work. I asked if they had any Port Ellen or Brora and he said he stopped buying it as the stuff that was vaguely affordable i.e. sub $700USD a bottle wasn't that great, didn't last and he pulled the last bottle off the shelf after 2 weeks open as he just in good conscience couldn't sell it. A couple of years later I got my hands on a sample of a $1000usd+ bottle for a reasonable $50USD and yeah nice dram but to be honest I preferred what Johnnie Walker did in their Blue Label blend. However it's nice sitting in the sun drinking a piece of history and it is a lovely dram just not mindblowing. Sweet vanilla, fennel, cooked cabbage and petrol, very light and well balanced and nicer than the taste descriptors make it sound. You are definitely drinking it and judging it on what it's a memory of rather than for the taste experience. RIP Port Ellen I await your rebirth. Hmm I see I'm up to the number of the beast in tastes.. not sure if that's an unlucky thing or not so I better keep tasting!"
