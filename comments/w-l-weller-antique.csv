4.75,"Toffee and caramel nose, cinnamon, vanilla spice,"
4.25,"Nose is incredible - sweet wheat, cake frosting, raspberries, spicy, new oak.

Palate - sweet wheat, hints of corn, milk chocolate and dark fruit before a powerful punch of cinnamon and rye spice with hints of black licorice.  This finish lingers forever and the aftertaste is a sugary, toasted oak that persists after several sips of water.

This is my second bottle.  The first one was mediocre at best.  It reminded me of a cigar and licking a leather couch.  This bottle has completely changed my mind.  I'm blown away at the sweet complexity of this bourbon.  I know the hype that surrounds it is sometimes frustrating, but this is great stuff even if it ever starts sitting on the shelves."

4.0,"Sweet like it's little brother SR, but fuller/thicker. Higher alcohol and cinnamon burn."
4.0,"There are certainly things about this whiskey I don’t understand, and I am seeking your help. But I’ll get into that later.

This tasting is of a 2018ish bottle, before the gold cork “upgrade.” I’ll get into that later too.

The nose shows a decent amount of oak. I get sour lemon, caramel, grainy bread, sugared walnuts. All very well done.

Body is gentle, as you’d expect from a wheated bourbon. There’s sugar, licorice, tea leaves, sweet tarts. Rich orange flavor emerges when trying to recall the lemon from the nose. Big fan of that note.

Finish is nutty. There’s cinnamon, sugar, walnuts, grainy bread. Remarkably smooth. Only a mild lingering tongue buzz.

Overall, my favorite parts were the orange on the body and the sour, oaky nose. I could do without the licorice and tea leaves here, but overall a very good, enjoyable drink. I’m most impressed by how smooth this is for 107 proof. It goes down like a 90 proof or lower!

———

All that said, I don’t understand this whiskey, and I want to. I understand the flavors, and I understand the quality. I like this whiskey. Here’s what I don’t understand:

1 point higher official rating on Distiller.
0.2 stars higher community rating.
Used to be twice the cost of WSR, now thrice. 
Thrice I tell you!

First question: does anyone know why this went from around $45 in my region to around $70? During this time it went from a maroon screw top to a nice gold foil cork, but is there an actual upgrade to the juice? Every source I’ve seen says no. So why on a whim did they up the price on this specific product? Costs more than a Weller 12 year now!

Second question: why are there so many rubrics in which this is considered superior to WSR? It has some complexity over WSR for sure but that comes at a cost. As smooth as OWA is, WSR is smoother. The flavors that OWA can hold over WSR’s head aren’t gained without losing some of my favorite WSR notes like tart apple. If you drink them back to back, like I am right now (for science) OWA gains a bitter aftertaste that I don’t care for, and WSR acts like a palate cleanser.

If you’re as into this label as I am and have an opinion on this, I’d love to hear it. Cheers!"

Tried diluted with water- not as bold, but I think would best served with ice.

Tried on the rocks- the lower temperature really brings out the sweetness, the best way to drink this in my opinion!"

4.5,"The nose of the bourbon reveals its spiciness before it ever meets the tongue.  It consists of sweet hints of caramel and vanilla with an earthy spice to it made up of cinnamon and very faint whisps of nutmeg.  The nose finishes with just a hint of fruit before the alcohol.

On the palate, the whiskey is sweet and strong.  The vanilla and caramel flavors expected from the nose are present, though the high proof and cinnamon plays over them.  It has an oily finish with a spicy bite in the throat.  It sits like a small fire in the chest, which, though strong, is not unpleasant.

Would recommend enjoying as one would a rye whiskey.  Should stand up to mixing in cocktails better than the average bourbon.  If drinking neat or on ice, be sure to sip, not to quaff."

3.0,"It has a nice nose, though it has less caramel in it than many bourbons. There are hints of nutmeg. All good. Then I tasted it. Perhaps because it is 107 proof, the bite overwhelms everything else. The corn and wheat can't stand up to it. The finish is alright, given that we are going in to it somewhat behind already."

More spices on the tongue/palate.  Something floral too. Wonderful warmth all the way down. Oak comes through big time on the finish like fresh oak sawdust. Lingering sense of cacao powder. Long finish rolls out all the notes.  I'd get this anytime I see it!"

5.0,"The first and only Whiskey I’ve ever given a perfect score on here. This is my favorite whiskey out there and turned me on to wheated bourbons forever. Most dominant notes for me are a candy sweet cherry up front, a nice brown sugar on the mid palate. Then a candied oak, almost like a honey roasted almond on the finish. I can’t brag highly enough on this one. The only downside is how rare it is to find around me. I’m always searching for the day that I find a whiskey that I like better than this. But I don’t see that day coming anytime soon. Give this one a shot if you can. You won’t be disappointed."

3.75,This is a great pour and the price point is decent. Weller sr was a little too light for me and this bottle corrects that! 65$ lcbo pricing is worth every penny. Secondary pricing at 90$ is what I’ve paid and still not a bad price for these bottles 👌

4.0,"Amber with heavy legs. Maple syrup, caramel, dark cherries and green apple rind. Nose similar to the other BT products.

Palate is round and rich. Cherries and green apple coming through, confirming nose. Mild heat that lingers in the center of the tongue. 

I use the rating scale below. Distiller uses a scale of 5 and I use a scale of 10, but I’m sure you’re not too drunk to do the math! 

1. Disgusting - So bad I poured it out.
2. Poor - I wouldn't consume by choice.
3. Bad - Multiple flaws.
4. Below average - Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.
5. Good - Just average.
6. Very Good - Better than average.
7. Great - Well above average.
8. Excellent - In a league of its own.
9. Incredible - An all-time favorite.

2.5,"Despite the higher ABV, it is pretty smooth. However the flavors are not that complex OR my palette is not developed enough to discern them. I may be judging this harshly - it may be a wonderful wheated bourbon, I think I am just not a fan of wheated bourbon. Or it could be that I am just still swooning over the Four Roses Single Barrel. 

Predominate flavors in my opnion is burnt chocolate up front with an oily mouth feel. Alcohol burn and red hots afterwards. Finish and aftertaste is thick honey. Not unpleasant, but not enough pleasure to make this one high on my list."

Maple syrup, cherry, honey, almond extract, and fair amount of alcohol

Palate:
Honey sweetness up front, but then nothing but cherry hard candy

Finish:
The cherry carries on forever, then finally fades into sweet oak

Overall:
Not super complex but still really enjoyable. If I could actually find this I could see this as a perfect nightly sipper. I was on the fence between a 4 or a 3.75, but the availability decided it for me."

5.0,"Phenomenonal!  Starts off smooth but unimpressive the a huge explosion of flavor leading with spice and cinnamon, fishing with caramel apple.  Strongly prefer this one neat. Ice doesn't enhance, it just waters it down.
It's great bourbon, well worth the $50 msrp, but it's unfortunately very difficult to find at that price where I live, like most Buffalo Trace products, and not worth the secondary market prices. (Nothing is imo). Maker's Mark Cast Strength has a similar tast profile at a much more reasonable cost and far better availability in my area."

4.0,"Just a quick hit on this one. Somehow my brother-in-law found a bottle of this (screw cap and all), and was kind enough to share some. Nose is subtle and unassuming, like most wheaters I try, but the palate is vastly different from Makers (read: better), and it tastes like someone liquified a Werthers Original. So much smooth caramel. I can see why this is in high demand. Cheers!"

4.5,"Very mild cinnamon, vanilla and fruit bowl smell, moderate to long finish with similar taste to smell at first then finishes with some smokey and spicy flavor"
3.5,"I’ve been sitting on this one for a couple of years, but after finishing off many of the other whiskies in my collection it felt time to finally open this one.  After having the Special Reserve I’m excited to see how this one compares.

Nose: The nose is very sweet. Starts out with honey and brown sugar. Further searching also reveals vanilla and cinnamon.

Palate: The sweetness continues. Honey and cinnamon are present at first. The extra proof helps the intensity of the flavors and also adds a bit of a numbing affect on the tongue.

Finish: The brown sugar lingers for a second before a sensation similar spiciness coats the mouth from the high proof.

An easy drinking whiskey that is dangerously easy to sip given it’s high proof. For me the sweetness is the dominant feature and it isn’t very complex. It is however a great whiskey to sit on the porch on a hot day and sip away while smoking some barbecue.

Cheers!"
4.0,Bursting with flavor. Cinnamon and vanilla on the nose. Begins with a sweet explosion that turns to a spicy yet smooth finish.
4.25,"Tastes like a less insane version of Rip Van Winkle 10, which works in its favor, as the oak bite isn’t trying to rip out your tongue.

Lots of maple syrup, brown sugar, vanilla. Taste is less sweet than the nose, and has an odd black tea note like the Van Winkle. All around pleasant stuff, but of course not enough to warrant the rarity or the price. Still quite nice though."
