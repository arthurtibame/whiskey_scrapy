4.0,"Believe it or not, Campbeltown has more to offer than Springbank. Glen Scotia has always been a bit under the radar, but it has a lot to offer as a distillery! The 15-year-old expression has an intriguing nose, featuring salted caramel, pastries and apricots. Porridge, honey and floral scent add to the complexity. Spicy, aromatic and increasingly cask-dominated, the palate is balanced out by subtle sweetness, bitter walnuts and a touch of arugula. Lemon balm, nutmeg and salt linger in the resinous finish. Almost like Clynelish 14, a singular malt with character.

RATING: 3.9/5.0 stars ≙ 86 pts → FIRST-CLASS [-]"

3.0,"It's a nice whisky that is well-balanced and enjoyable - it plays it safe and is inoffensive, and that's the problem. The nose is a little weak with a touch of honey and oak. The palace is sweet with hints of citrus . The finish is medium in length, with the vanilla and spice you expect from an ex-bourbon cask. It was ok."
4.0,"Like the Victoriana, it's been quite a while since I sampled this whisky, but I just found my notes from the tasting again and wanted to post them before they get lost on my desk again. On the nose...grape soda, dried fruit, nuttiness, salt air. Palate...Cracker Jack caramel, salted nuts, dry malt, and raisin notes at the finish. It was good, very good even, but I preferred the Victoriana."

Springbank is more ashy, sooty, complex Dram, while this comes across as lighter, every day type.  Grapefruit and sweet tea.  Some smoke, just a tad.  As if you're having a citrus fruit three houses away from a guy doing a barbecue.   Quite good, definately worth a try and a full bottle."

4.0,"Scotland, September 2017. Whisky#13

Nose: Brine, malt, faint honey, bacon or smoked ham, Airfix glue (!), tinned peaches, sandalwood. The cask influence is lightly aromatic rather than heavy oak. Adding water brings forth more honey.

Palate: sweet cereal arrival, then a dry ginger and almost effervescent briny tang that is much nicer than it might sound. I was expecting something heavier but this is light and sprightly. A dash of water softens and melds the palate beautifully (try it with a tiny splash of soda water or sparkling mineral water - so drinkable!).

Finish: Long, mainly cereal with some sneaky, oily smoke threading about and a salty sweet aftertaste. Even a little licorice.

Very smooth and rich but also very light - if Springbank 15 is an autumnal afternoon this is a brisk spring morning. Quite delightful. My esteem for this distillery continues to rise.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

5.0,"The Bottle: Restrained.  There is a small black label on both the front, and back, with some decent information about what's in the bottle; along with a nice relief of the company logo and city of origin.  The bottle is a touch tall for my taste, but there is neither anything stand-out nor regrettable about it.

In the Glass: Bronze.

On the Nose: Rich and complex.  There is the ""Campbeltown style"" to the way this is put together, notes of sweet and salt intermingled with touches of chocolate and dried fruit.  the balance on this is really quite good, there's just enough of everything so that no one component takes away from the other.  
Very inviting. 

Taste:  Powerful arrival of sweet and salt that develops into pronounced notes of: dark chocolate, dates/figs and absinth of all things.  That may sound like an odd flavor to be in there, but it sits so well in the mix with everything else.  I believe that even Distiller puts ""chocolate covered pretzels"" in their review and I can honestly see why, that's exactly the backbone of the finish that this develops.  Along with the green fairy sidekick, the chocolate pretzel makes for a complex and lasting flavor.
I've never had another spirit that was quite like it.

I'm not sure how Glen Scotia gets these flavors into their malt, but I hope that they don't change a thing.  This is one of my favorite Scottish single-malts, hands-down.  
I used to think that the Springbank 15 was the best thing to ever come out of Cambpeltown...but I gotta say, this pipped it.
At the time of this review, I have yet to try their other offerings; though the Victoriana and the 18 are both on my list.

I highly recommend picking up a bottle if you are looking for a non-peated single malt and you're ready for something that isn't from Speyside"
3.75,"Dramfest `18...day 2....somewhere near the end....I only now realise I already had a sample of that at home :-). I can't read all my notes but I got 3.25 crossed our and then 3.5. Ah actually I can...I had this after the Ardbeg Coryvecken so 46% vs a peated 57.1%....it was probably handicapped from the start. Slightly ethanolly, then richness, then unbalanced. The correyveckan and more than 10% seemed to have more balance between alcohol and flavour. I will retry and adjust rating if I've been unfair! 3.5 it is for now.
Update 5 months later. Now I have another sample to enjoy at my leisure my rating has definitely gone up a notch. Bubblegum winey toffee on the nose and palate, hint of smoke, bit of drying oak and salt very nice. Definitely a jump up to a 3.75 (4 less .25 for aftertaste). The drying slightly bitter soap suddy thinner aftertaste stops it being really great and from memory I think the Victoriana was better. (I gave that a 4.25). Still at around $55USD here in NZ very good value for $. I've been impressed by some of the Glen Scotias..bar the double cask."

4.0,"Thanks to Everwind for a sample! The nose brings floral/herbal notes, sweetness from ginger, honey, vanilla, strawberries, raspberries, and deep tea. Bright and effervescent.  46% ABV, so just a couple drops of water.  The palate brings some complex flavors of grapes, cola, savory liver, leather, and maritime salt. The finish is medium in length with a nice mouth coat. There is a Caol Ila type of smoke lingering. This dram is in a class of its own without comparison. The theme should be something equivalent, like ""The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway"" by Genesis. 4.25. It really makes me want to find an 18 or higher age statement from them."

Salted chocolate, coffee caramels, and a bit of smoke. This hits all the right notes for me.  Looking forward to trying out the 18yo next. 

Between this, Springbank 10 & 15, and the Kilkerran 12, Campbeltown has become one of my favorite scotch whisky regions."

5.0,"Okay, about halfway through the bottle so time for the review. I have to confess that I have been absolutely chomping at the bit to post this review. This is to date one of the finest scotches I have ever had. Coming from Southern Louisana I am a fan of bold, savory, salty, and spicy foods. One of my favorite local delicacies are raw oysters. The briny taste is spectacular. I’ve had briny Islays, notably Talisker that are very enjoyable. This however takes briny to another level. You can actually smell salt on the nose. But, that’s not all, you also get a syrupy molasses on the nose. And in the background on the nose you can even find faint orchard fruits...I want to say apple, and some barrel spice. 
On the palate, there is a thick viscous explosion of salt/brine, with waves of spice and a background of sweet orchard fruits. Medium to long finish. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would. And now, another sip......"

If I tasted this without knowing how this was made, I would’ve guessed that there were sherry and/or cab barrels used in addition to bourbon. There are beautiful plum, nectarine and cherry flavors on the palate. That is balanced with notes of salted caramel and dark chocolate.

4.25,"Glen Scotia’s 2015 re-launch was my first foray into Campbeltown single malts. At the time, you could find bottles of Glen Scotia 15 for a little over $50, not unlike another reliable 15 yo, Dalwhinnie 15. As I’ve been re-evaluating my shopping list of late, I see this bottle has been creeping up quite a bit, closer to $70, $75. It seems all the free advertising I did by bringing this bottle to whisky nights paid off for them. Or, more likely, they finally figured out what a winner they had on their hands and reappraised it accordingly. (I also wouldn’t be surprised if the 2019 buyout was responsible for the latest price bump I witnessed this year...)

In any case, let’s find out more about this whisky and if it still warrants a purchase at its new price point. 

Straight out of the bottle, it has a lot going for it already. Bottled at 46% ABV and non-chillfiltered, with a pleasantly viscous appearance. Distiller says its barreled in ex-bourbon casks, but the bottle and information I’ve found says American oak - no mention of bourbon.  My only complaint is that coloring is added - of all the whiskies I’ve sampled, this one is pretty high up on my list for unnecessary colorant. 

Nose: Rich vanilla oak. Fruity and herbal notes that remind me of a white peach tea I’ve had before. A bit of sea spray. 

Palate:  Rich and decadent. Sweet and salty honey up front, followed by delicious bready malt, bits of chocolate, stone fruits, vanilla oak, baking spices, and autumn leaves. The mouthfeel on this dram is nothing short of impressive - incredibly smooth tannins, perfect acidity, and sumptuous oils. There’s not a off-note or harsh feeling to be found. Harmonious. 

Finish: Moderately long, with sweetness leading, followed by more sea spray and vanilla oak that lingers and lingers and never goes bitter. 

This is a solid, balanced, well-executed dram that really lets the quality of the malt and the casks speak for themselves. I’ve heard Glen Scotia 15 described as a basic, introductory malt - I think that’s accurate but also unfair. It makes a great introductory malt for being so approachable, yet approachability doesn’t mean this has any less interesting or appealing character to offer. In fact, those new to whisky might miss the full potential this dram has to offer. 

Verdict? I’m keeping a bottle around for now, even if it’s $70. 

4.25 ~ 92 ~ Excellent"
2.75,"Kinda surprised I haven't gotten to this one yet.

So I'm realizing as I do these reviews here, i'd never really picked up on the salt notes in the nose or the differerent flavor profiles I get from oak on some of these scotches. I feel with it however I'm starting to get it with everything.  

Nose - some ash, salt, and I'm getting a mix of bourbon's vanilla and some red fruits from I would assume light sherry cask maturation (certainly has the color of sherry casks though the bottle only mentions american oak so perhaps the malt is giving off some red fruits itself and wow on the color). Possible this has been colored unfortunately. Maybe a jam over toast (feel like I get that a lot of campbeltown). 

Taste - Oh yeah this is cambeltown at it's best. Oak forward notes and the sweet flavors, builds up into salty brine and this incredible finish. I want to say some kind of salted, chocolate, menthol, spiced bread of some sort and well yes vanilla.

I'm a sucker for this. It's incredibly complex and I want to say there is about 70 bucks. Would I get this or a springbank 10 year? Well I'm getting both! But the 10 might be a hair better.  Either way 2.75 to match the 10 year. This or the springbank 10 are where people with a limited budget need to get into Cambeltown. They showcase the region and while expensive they've at least more affordable. 

Oh and this is my wheel house so I LOVE this stuff, but objectively the quality doesn't push way up for those wondering why the score isn't higher. 3.0's are very VERY good whisky and while there's nothing wrong with this I think it's missing that WOW element that someone who doesn't care for this profile might still decide they want it."

4.25,"On the nose it presents itself wearing a very evident Bourbon robe, with marzipan, vanilla, apricot, freshly baked tart. Over time, the aromas grow and stratify, with a surge of fruit (peach, melon, yellow orange), lemon zest and a delicate coastal profile. Sprinkled with cinnamon.
The palate turns out to be very saline, with a herbaceous and moist cut that clears the olfactory aromas, making the unfriendly soul of Glen Scotia a little rediscovered.
Pepper, walnuts, touch of malt and smooth wood, ginger, light bitter undertone. Lemon. The contrast between palate and smell when drinking is in some ways unsettling, it almost seems to be with two different whiskeys, practically a bipolar distillate. Underneath, but just underneath, there is also a hint of peaty smoke, but the time to notice it is already gone.
Rather long, dry, herbaceous and lemon-like finish, with wood, spices and a hint of orange.
It is a drink so unconventional that it is fun! Definitely not easy, probably repelling for some, but really fun and original."
