2.0,No fruit or sweet flavor. A bit bland. Tiny bit of wet-leather scent. Not the best mouth feel.

3.0,Very different but full of flavor. Smoky and not sweet like many bourbons.

3.0,"Kinda smells like a dead hog with a leather purse in a sow's ear, horrible mouth feel. It's smoky, but not in a positive way, more like ""Wow, feels like I just smoked a pack and a half of Marlboro reds and followed it with a carton of menthol golds"". Would recommend to someone who lacks a sense of smell."

3.0,You know what? Kinda reminds me of scotch. Bit smokey up front with a sweet floral honey finish.

2.25,"Barrel heavy on the nose. Feels more like new sawdust then an old barrel. Sweetness of the corn prevails on the palate, with a bright lemon grass herbal quality and hints of  vanilla. 
I think that bringing this up to 90 proof certainly made it more flavorful, but I do taste whiffs of ethanol that shouldn’t be there too."
2.25,"Cashed another bottle while making bourbon brown sugar pulled pork. Batch 1905, bottle 1265."
3.0,"A little flat, but you can definitely taste the proof"
