4.25,"Finally I'm aboard the Dingle bandwagon with batch numero dos! In short, it's good, I like it, you should try it.

The much longer version is these guys started a brewery / chain pub in Dublin and then branched out to making whiskey in a place near a small town called (take a wild guess). They converted an old sawmill and dug down to source water from an aquifer and hey presto water was turned into whiskey. Sadly one of the co-founders died a couple of years ago but his name lives on on barrel number one (the first casks were sold to founding members who had their names put on them). Other interesting facts: The artwork on their bottles is done by an Irish artist and their current head distiller used to be a local dairy farmer!

It's a lovely dram complex honey, apricot and more going on. Maybe a 4.25 I'm thinking as the balance is spot on."
4.0,"Better than batch #1, Oloroso and PX casks work really well on this one. Worth noting that no finishing is done, the whiskey is aged on first-fill casks from day 1 to the bottling"

4.5,"Created by combining the use of Sherry (Pedro Ximenez and Oloroso) and Bourbon casks. Delicate, dry, with citrus and subtle vanilla notes. The Dingle distillery was founded in 2012 and is named after the small port town it is based in, located in the west of Ireland on the Wild Atlantic Way. Each bottle has been branded with a Bottle number and a Batch Number.Bottled at 46.5%abv, non-chill filtered, and with no added colouring, this follows on from a great first release. Extremely limited stocks. Dingle Whiskey Cask Strength recently won the Gold Medal at the Irish Whiskey Awards 2016

Nose: Slightly floral at first, then toffee, raisin and peppercorn.
Taste: Chocolate, fresh malt and a touch of red wine.
Finish: Allspice, butterscotch and lemongrass.
