5.0,"Continuing my series of reviews of ""the Distillery Reserve Collection"" whiskies from Pernod Ricard, i am about to tell you about one perfect dram. An amazing sherry dark bomb. It is the Aberlour 17yo, Single Cask Strength. So much flavor in one 50cl bottle. Just amazing. 

Bottled at 52.8%abv, deep copper color. 

On the nose, it is spectacular. Blackberry marmalade, Sherry madness, Red wine, maybe Cabernet sauvingon. 

On the palate, its a sweet monster. Chocolate, milk powder, Almonds, Sherry and Cherries. Sublime.

Aftertaste is also a work of art. All spiciness comes from the sherry profile. Pepper, Ginger, more Sherry and pleasant Tobacco.

Balance is the name of the game. This whisky has it all, and has this score well deserved. 100 over 100, Sláinte Mhath!!!"
