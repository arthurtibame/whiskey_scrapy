5.0,"Surprisingly smooth. I must admit that I am a converted Chardonnay drinker, now enjoying whiskeys and bourbons. I have really enjoyed exploring bourbon and whiskey  in the past few months. I had the honor of trying Uncle Nearest on a recent trip to Nashville, and I was so surprised by just how smooth it was at 100 proof. I enjoy it neat, or on a BIG ice cube, so as not to water it down."

5.0,"This whisky is in the top tier. It's smooth taste and full flavor allows all levels of whisky drinkers to enjoy a top shelf whisky at a reasonable price. I bought a bottle at 2 short months and 3 barbeques later I find myself saddened by the empty bottle on my shelf, but over joyed with the memories it's helped cultivate. Time to pick up another!"
5.0,One of the smoothest Whiskey's I have had the priviledge of tasting. I've learned over the years to enjoy a good drink as is. On the rocks for me on this premium product.

2.5,Super oaky and smokey whiskey. Not sweet at all but very very smooth.
3.0,"Uncle Nearest; 3/5 stars. Simple sweet & spicey flavor with little bite even though it's 100 proof. Aged around 8-9 years. 
Uncle Nearest White whiskey; 4/5 stars. Nose reminds me of silver rum. Has a light Joven mezcal smokey flavor. Very young aged whiskey filtered through coconuts. Very unique whiskey."

3.0,"So know what you are getting into here. This is a very smooth but very extreme flavored whiskey. Its going to hit you hard with the smokey wood on the palate. This bottle would be amazing for smokey old fashion. Its almost not even oak, i feel like i’m sipping jack daniels (but much smoother) and eating pecan smoked pork sausage. It will remind you of a texas bourbon, just way better tasting and not sweet at all. So if u want some unique woody smoke in your life, grab a bottle. But if you are looking for sweet bourbon, this is not your bottle."

3.75,"Fairly absent nose with a nice little punch up front. Caramel and vanilla follow with a tad more heat that gives way to pecan shells, moss, and touch of dryness. Thin finish that interestingly lingers. Served up with a small ice marble that smoothed out the spice over time."

4.0,Vanilla or light marshmallow smell. Front end syrupy and finishes very smooth. Much smoother than other 100 proof I have tried.
4.0,"Nose of caramel sweetness and corn. Taste comes with a little heat but also smoothness on the finish. Definitely, has the Tennessee whiskey taste with the charcoal filtering. I actually like this whiskey better than the standard Jack Daniels. This is a new company and other reviewers tend to criticize the brand based on the price point, and it’s a little pricey but worth it. It’s a promising whiskey and I can’t wait until the brand comes out with a cask strength version of this whiskey!"

3.0,"Neat then one small ice cube.
Nose: vanilla, pecan pie, caramelized apples.
Palate: at first get the all-spice and clove, then slight vanilla.
Finish: all-spice/clove/nutmeg comes back slightly harsh coating the tongue. An ice helps open up the sweeter pecan.
Overall decent but overpriced. Perhaps the story upped the retail price."
2.0,really harsh finish. seems stronger than the 100 proof would suggest
2.0,"Tasted at NJ Whiskylive.  Overly sweet, like corn syrup infused with maple.  Hard pass.  Unless you like corn syrup infused with maple."

5.0,I'm new here but I really enjoyed this whiskey. It does have a sweet note but a smoothness that I havent noticed in other brands. If there is a better whiskey or even one that compares please let me know!
3.5,"Contemporary research (or re-writing history, depending on your viewpoint) indicates that Jack Daniel learned to distil whiskey from a Lynchburg preacher’s slave, Nathan Green. Fawn Weaver, an African-American woman who is an investor and author (“Happy Wives Club”) purchased the preacher’s former home in Lynchburg and started Uncle Nearest, Inc.
Since, in 2019, it is too soon for a quality whiskey distillery started in 2017. Uncle Nearest markets product from distillers in Nashville under the Uncle Nearest brand name until they build their own distillery in Shelbyville. The distillers use Tennessee grains, a special yeast strain, double distillation, the exclusive Lincoln County process, and new American oak barrels with no age statement.
Uncle Nearest 1856 has a bronze or dark amber appearance with a hint of red. The nose is rich followed by charcoal and sweetness of maple. Nearest has a smooth palate with caramel, corn, and apple. The sweetness transitions to a spicy oak blend. The spice flow through the finish and mixes with caramel. 
 Unclear Nearest 1856 is a quality Tennessee whiskey, but is priced higher than comparable whiskies. I will wait to purchase another until the price drops about $20/bottle because the lore is compelling but not worth that premium."

Body- The sweetness continues with a candy and tobacco sweetness and a hint of lemon tartness. Then you feel the heat of the 100 proof. 
Finish- Fairly simple. The tannins give way to a slight bitterness."

3.5,"Was out in Charlotte NC for business this week and found a gem of a Whiskey bar where I was able to sample a number of Whiskeys I have been curious about. Let's start the review your with this offering. This is a sourced Whiskey out of 2 separate distillery's (one is Dickel and the other is undisclosed). Bottled at 50% ABV and is an NAS. I have heard not great things about the new Small Batch offering of this (1820 white label) but this seems to be better received. Let's dive in:

Palette is thin but rich with very classic TN Whiskey notes of vanilla, maple syrup and pecans. Tasty entry adds toasted oak and lots of pepper spices. Finish is medium, slightly astringent with rock candy and orange peel complimenting the oak.

All in all it's a nice step up from entry TN Whiskey and actually a pleasant pour. For $60 it's a poor value as a bottle but but for an $11 pour I was very happy. Fans of Dickel or Jack I think would really enjoy this and may feel the bottle is worth the high price. All others seek a pour and be sure to lion for the Green and not White label. 

Cheers all!"

4.25,"Full-flavored bourbon. Not overly spicy or hot but just enough to keep you interested. Classic bourbon flavors, but not a heavy oak bourbon. Dense and sweet with a bit of mid-palate all-spice and cinnamon. Soft on the tongue with an initial sweetness, but then immediately drys out the mouth and goes into a really nice finish. Not super chewy on the finish, but enough to where you can hold onto the flavors for a minute. If I'm trying to be nitpicky you can kinda pull out a varnish note, but overall it's so well blended that the entire dram works cohesively together and is enjoyable all the way through."

5.0,"Here is my review:

The burst of flavors is worth a few seconds of reflection.  My perception is that all of what I taste is a forward sensation.  The mellowness happens on the swallow.  The brew is like an explosion on sip, but a muffled explosion.  I am picking up on a warm spice, caramelized vanilla, and the sweetness is really hidden to balance out much of the variety in the bourbon.

Smell: powdery, sweet, raisin
Visual: golden copper
Feel: smooooth and moving towards a bite

This is really nice.  The problem is that you want to keep trying to figure it out.

Well done, Uncle Nearest, well done."
