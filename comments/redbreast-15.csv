3.0,"Coming from the 12 year, I taste very similar flavors in this 15 year. The chief difference I can detect is an amplification of flavor and an increase in backend burn. So there's a harder hit of caramel, a harder citrus flavor to follow, and a harder burn. I understand the tradeoff from a distilling perspective, and I'm glad I tried it once. However, from now on it's the 12-year I'll keep in my collection."

4.0,"Drinking this side to side with the 12 year this edged it out simply for the higher abv which I now prefer. I'd love to see the 12 year non cask at the same strength to better ascertain the impact of Olorosso only vs bourbon influence. Also I've since moved on to enjoy more intensely flavoured sherry bomb and in your face peat style whiskys so it'd be interesting to see how I now rate this one year after I finished my last bottle. Update: Roll on several months later and a new bottle. Does it still hold up? I perhaps unfairly put it up against my gold standards in the peat and sherry world's - Laphroaig 10 and Glendronach 15 Revival. Amazingly it held up not to badly. Is it as good? No if they are a 5 this is more a 4.2 - 4.5, it doesn't have the intense flavor profile I love.. But still a lovely viscosity...If I'd tasted this for the first time after these two it'd have got a 4 so sadly down it goes"

    Yes, I will be restocking this.  Redbreast is awesome, and I want the entire lineup.
    
    I never liked Irish whiskey until Redbreast.  The best purchases are the 12 year old cask strength and the 21 year old, but this 15 year old will not disappoint.  On the nose, this is like smelling a freshly baked oatmeal raisin cookie with a perfectly balanced backdrop of bourbon and sherry influence.  There’s a dank mustiness of 15 years of age that is just as pleasant.  The palate is harmony.  Nothing dominates.  Sultanas, wood spices, a touch of vanilla and Sulphur funk (not enough to be a detractor).  Peppery, silky smooth finish.  This tastes luxurious, and I can’t see anyone who can drink spirits neat not liking this whiskey.

4.25,"Nose - Dark caramel, hint of grass, hint of spicy leather, dark apple-cranberry juice.

Taste - Rich & oily mouthfeel, nice fruity spice, dark caramel, crisp berry cider, sweet leather, slightly fruity metallic, grilled stone fruits.

Finish - Lingering warm spice, dark fleshed fruits, light metallic, light spicy fruity bitterness

Score - 88/100

Final Thoughts - This is quite nice, it's pretty apparently this has spent some time aging in oak as it shows on the nose & palate. Nice rich mouthfeel and bold nose. Still maintains a lot of the characteristics I get from an Irish though of a very clean, almost grain-like quality. Interesting how I get a hint of the grassy notes on the nose, but it doesn't really show up on the palate. The only thing that's a bit off-putting is the metallic notes I get near the end. It's a bit distracting from the very pleasant initial experience.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - Probably not another"
4.5,Excellent. Balanced and layered with no dominating notes.  Best Irish whiskey I’ve tried though at the price point you are better off with the 12.

Irish Distillers (Midleton)
Redbreast OB
15 years old
46% ABV
Bottled 2017
Price: 90 USD.  

Redbreast, more than any other whisk(e)y brand, is like sex.  The whole regimented nose, palate, finish analysis will frustrate the enjoyment of this whiskey, like breaking down sex into foreplay, intercourse, and afterglow will ruin sex.  Don’t.  Redbreast is a simple joy, all about the enveloping silky textures and warm, voluptuous flavors.

Let’s face it, the Scotches I usually rave about are rough and challenging.  If they were female, they would be like Frances McDormand’s character in “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri.”  In contrast, Redbreast has a powerful yet traditional femininity.  Inviting flowers, buttery caramel, rich honey, dark chocolate.  If whiskies can be sultry, these are the ones.

Lasciviousness aside, some formal review stuff: 
The 15 year old is in an odd spot between the exquisite 12 year cask strength and the “she’s-out-of-your-league” 21 year old.  And there a few nitpicks: Midleton has a problem with sulfur influence in their sherry casks.  This is more prominent in this 15, compared to the 12 CS, which hides the sulfur via sheer ABV; and the 21, which subtracts the sulfur through age.  Also, there’s some metallic notes on the finish.  Still, this excellent whiskey has enough to offer at its price point to make it a worthwhile purchase if you are looking for more Redbreast options after trying the 12 CS, and don’t want to pay the premium for the 21.

3.0,"N: Some of same nutty, chocolate, and dark fruit I remember from the 12, but additionally there is a treble note of mineral tang there too.

P: the app review is right that there is a more pronouncing wood influence on this one. Some cherries and cranberry, slightly herbal, certainly not as rounded as I remember the 12. In spite of the age, this is a ""spikier"" whiskey than its younger brother, even with a few drops of water.

F: Long and warming, some bitterness like root vegetable or dark cocoa. Wood notes and hint of citrus lingers.

This is hardly a bad whiskey, but both from a value standpoint and my overall enjoyment, I do prefer the 12 and Lustau expressions more."

4.0,"I thought it high time I did another head to head tasting. This time around I'll be reviewing the four widely available expressions from Redbreast: the 12 year, 15 year, Lustau edition, and the 12 year Cask Strength (CS). I'd love to include the 21 year in this lineup but my wallet can't handle that sort of hit. If any of you fine folks would be willing to send a sample it'd be most appreciated. I'm also curious as to your opinions on my rankings and whether or not you'd rate these differently. Redbreast is one of my favorite whiskey brands and any of their expressions are worth having in your collection.

This one is definitely a bit more interesting. Color is the same in the glass as the other expressions, but the nose has a lot more barrel spice on it. Bit more alcohol on the nose as well. The taste here is where things really get interesting. There's more roundness and spice than the 12 year, and it reminds me of when I proof down the 12 year CS by myself. Curiously the finish isn't as long as it is on the standard 12, and it comes in a bit hotter also. Certainly a fine expression, but not worth the extra $$$ in my opinion.

For today's tasting I'm rating this #3  out of 4."

3.5,"Appearance: Orangey copper was the color of this lovely Irish whiskey, and thin watery legs slid down the glass’s walls, much like Tobey Maguire in the first Spiderman movie when he’s testing his powers.

Nose: A beautiful nose welcomes you with notes of caramel and honey, buttery cinnamon toast with brown sugar, dark notes of plum, blackberry, and cherry mixed with yogurt giving me a summer breakfast of berries and yogurt smell. Other notes fill in the extra space such as pine, barrel spice and char. A splash of water adds notes of honey, dandelion, and vanilla and causes it to smell very Canadian.

Taste: On the palate, a full oily body. It’s rich with notes of brown sugar and cinnamon again, dark ripe cherry, black pepper, with some medicinal and metallic notes hidden in there as well. Adding a splash of water gives it a sugary sweet Sour Patch candy vibe.

Finish: You are left with a medium long finish with a peppery spice aftertaste.

Thoughts: This whiskey is good; it’s complex and definitely worth trying. I recommend it. But, if it had a personality, I’d say it would be a little standoffish. I was slightly disappointed in there not being as much as I was expecting on the palate in comparison to the nose. When it comes down to it, of all the expressions of Redbreast I’ve had, I’m choosing the 12 as my favorite! All are good though! Thank you Midleton, for another great whiskey! Sláinte!"

Whereas the 12 is slow and steady wins the race, keeping the palate consistently full from sip to finish, this guy is like a bottle rocket; it hits you harder than the 12 with alcohol and sherry up front and then drops off. I’d need to sip it pretty consistently to keep up the savor. On the nose, it’s floral and metallic, like the tinge of well water. Copper sits with me on the quick finish."

It’s very front heavy. I will say, it’s got a lot more body than I would have expected from an Irish. But that’s partially due to the 92 proof. It’s got that little bit of heat from the higher alcohol content.

The finish is a tad bit hot, but the linger is incredible, although brief. It’s kinda like, “k bye!” after a few seconds.

Good dram! Lives up to what an Irish can be."
4.25,"Wonderful berry and almond nose, slight licorice and caramel on tongue. A substantial heat rising up on the swallow. But wants you to come back for more."

3.5,Decided to go with this instead of bourbon tonight. On the nose there is strong citrus. It starts with a light feel and a hint of lemon peel. The finish is medium and gets spicer before it finishes. A good pour and Redbreast is my favorite Irish but I think my game is still bourbon!

4.25,Tasted as a set with the 12 year and Lustau. You immediately notice a difference in the sweeter nose of this vs the 12. Prominent honey and vanilla flavors.  Lingering mellow burn at the finish.  Definitely prefer this over the 12 year. This may be my favorite Irish Whiskey to date.

4.0,"Nose: pot still, pears, caramel apples

Palate: creamy and chewy, more caramel apple, pot still and baking spice. Light and refreshing

Finish: warm spices"
4.75,"Redbreast 15 is a grand whiskey. Supposedly it is the same “juice” as the 12, aged in both bourbon and sherry casks; but, bottled at an older age and the higher proof of 46%ABV. I have no idea if the casks are hand selected for the extra aging, if they come from a certain part of the warehouse, etc. It pours slightly reddish light amber. It noses very much like the 12 year old, toasted cereal grains, citrus (lemon?), sherry fruit, and a hint of oak bitterness this time. In the mouth these flavors predicted by the nose burst forth and play well together. The only real negative is that oak bitterness comes through toward the end and lingers in the finish. Yes, this is a grand whiskey---but, if I had to choose between this 15 and the 12 to have as my daily dram on some lonely isle for the rest of my days, I would choose the 12. It is ever so slightly more balanced to my taste."

3.25,"The fifteen year seems to have lost some of 12s bite, which I actually enjoyed. It's much smoother and I think a bit more fruitier behind the grass, apple and green grapes. Shorter tail but without any of the burn or heat of the 12, so I'm not as fond of it. I find it more complex though. Bright grassy tail."

2.5,"What a dissapointment. I really liked the 12yo and i just had the amazing 21yo but this is a ghost compared to those two. I am not a great fan of fruity whiskies and this is an irish that resembles a speysider. 

46%abv.

On the nose there is this dim chocolate note mixed with fruits. Is like chocolate mixed with sider. Green apples and that is it. 

On the palate: apples and chocolate. It feels like an oily sider. Not good. Aftertaste is watery. Hate when that happens. A hint of clove. 

Had to add a couple drops of water to see if it gets better. It improved the whiskey a lot. Caramel and tobacco appeared on the nose. On the palate some typical grain whiskey vanilla showed up. Clove got a little better on the aftertaste. 

Overall, i dont want to be harsh but this one has a good reputation and it didn't live up to it for me. Sorry but this is a 52 over 100 in my score system."
4.0,"It's not fair to compare the 12 to this, but the higher 46% ABV is immediately picked up by the nose: lemon cookies awash in a wave of alcohol.  The palate is oily and mouth-coating with butter cookies, and notes of nut butter underneath it all.  (Thanks to JCStylz for the dead-on tasting notes.)  Characters of red, and citrus, fruits also accentuate the palate, before the wood spice makes it's appearance.  A subsequent nosing highlights the butter cookie note.  With the finish closing in, I start smacking my lips and that's when the slight oak bitterness is detected.  That eventually mellows into a lightly sweet aftertaste.  Enough! Time for another sip!  

This is definitely a step up from the 12, introducing a deeper flavor profile.  Is it worth the $30 USD hike in price?  It depends on what your drinking mood is about.  If you want something of good quality and simple - a movie glass - the Redbreast 12 checks off those boxes.  However, if you want to enjoy a dram with a degree of complexity, without having to work too hard, the Redbreast 15 is the right choice.  (I am eager to see how it develops with air, as the bottle goes down.)  Of the half-dozen Irish whiskies I've tried thus far, this one takes the cake.

4.0,"Some reviews have said that the 12 year is better but I disagree. The15 is expensive but those extra three years and higher ABV really kick this whisky up a notch with regard to the spices and the fruit/cherry notes. The nose and palate share many of the tasting notes from the 12, but the 15 provides a better, more rounded mouthfeel that coats the tongue better and holds the finish longer. I rate the 12 as a solid 88. This is a step up and scores 90 in my book. Yes, it’s expensive, so if money is a priority then stick with the 12, but if the extra dollars are within your budget, then go with the 15 because it’s a wonderful example of what Ireland has to offer."
4.0,it's been awhile since I've had 12 but it didn't blow me away. I'm a little disappointed I likely will just buy 12 in the future as it's as delicious and much cheaper

3.75,"About my 3rd pour of this.

Nose: this is a little more potent than the 12. I get more of the alcohol on the nose. Same danish cookies smell but seems more concentrated. Light citrus zest, buttery pastries. Melon. Honeydew

Taste: oily butter cookie goodness. Spices and oak follow. Hints of almond butter. Dark chocolate is what coats the throat to finish.

Mouthfeel: this feels oilier than most whiskeys I’ve had. Spice hits the back of the throat right away and lingers there till it subsides. The flavor hits the tongue and leaves the wood flavors and spices quickly."
4.5,Happy St. Paddy’s Day! I’m really loving this bottle.
4.0,"Nose is toasty pastry dough, some honey and nuttiness, like baklava, with a little citrus, and pepper. More of the barrel is apparent, when compared with the 12. 
Taste is buttery, slightly sweet, honey, warming on the tongue, nice even pepper, long pleasant finish. Compared favorably with a good bourbon. In fact, if like to get a bottle and do side-by-side comparisons with a few bourbons.
I like this quite a bit more than the 12. There's more development, it's one of those that over the course of a bottle, you can keep picking out new smells and flavors."
