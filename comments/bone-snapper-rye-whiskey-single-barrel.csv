4.5,"Neat. Neck pour. Gallenstein pick, 120 proof, 6 year MGP.  Classic MGP rye on the nose, almost indistinguishable from a Rossville I have.  Rye, dill and mint up from.  A lovely rye bread.  Getting some pear and vanilla as I sit with it.  The nose is interesting as it goes from light to dark notes, back and forth every time I go in.  

So oily and viscous.  Really coats.  This really good.  Lights the tongue up instantly with this dark maple and pepper.  Swings back with a lovely vanilla and the pear.  Leaves you with that rye and hint of dill.  This is top notch MGP rye.  The legs hang in there too, really lingers with that vanilla.

Hard to believe this is 120 proof.  I think this could easily pass for 100 even.  I’m impressed by this pick.  Beats the Rossville (non-store pick) I have.  I am not a fan of the dill note I get from MGP rye but this has enough going on around and beyond it that it has won me over on the first impression."
