4.5,Unbelievably complex taste for a two-year old bourbon.  The malt adds a body and backbone to the creamy vanilla and caramel notes.  An excellent bourbon that gives you more than most other bourbons.  It is hard to believe that they crammed so much into this one bottle.  I highly recommend that you try this.

5.0,My favorite flavor profile from all of Chattanooga Whiskey. Incredible depth but still very drinkable.
4.25,Sweet with a small heat finish
3.75,Good whiskey
2.75,"Nutty, slightly sweet."
2.75,Good whiskey but vaguely reminds me of caramel corn which I’m not a huge fan of. Not for me particular palate but a good whiskey none the less
4.5,Light body with lots of charred vanilla on the end. Tastes like toasted marshmallow

3.5,Assez rond en bouche mais une petite finale vinaigrée. L'alcool est assez bien contenu en bouche mais l'afterburn nous le souligne gentillement.

1.0,If you love Willett Pot Still or Noah’s Mill then buy this! It has that same cinnamon note that Willett fans crave.
1.0,I realized what I don’t like about this whiskey. It tastes too much like Willett Pot Still. I never did care for cinnamon notes in my bourbon.

3.25,"The malt gives off a creamy, bready sweetness. Think sticky toffee pudding. Didn't like this much the first time. This go 'round is better."
3.75,Love the distillery and find this a very easy drinking whiskey.
