4.5,"This travel exclusive i have never seen before, i tried on one of my tasting events, the owner of the house had it and poured me a dram. Spoiler: it is a beauty.

Bottled at 40%abv,  on the nose it has Dry cake, Sherry with peat, Caramel, icing sugar. Wonderful.

On the palate is very ""islander"": Spicy herbal, Meat, hard Salt and Ashes.

Finish salty and Ginger. Overall this is a great dram, 95 over 100, if you find it, grab it."
