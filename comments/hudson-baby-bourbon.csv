1.0,"This has gotta be one of the worst, overpriced bourbons I've ever had. young, harsh, corny and way overpriced. Perhaps I just don't like young bourbons, but I'll take a cheap  well whiskey from kentucky over this any day."
1.75,"Young, harsh, and hot (14 Advent19)"
2.5,Fruit on the nose. Vanilla and corn flavors before the alcohol melts your tastebuds. Young and needs to mellow.
2.0,Young harsh and heavy on the corn. Way overpriced for something not far from white lightning
3.25,Similar leathery taste as Koval Four Grain
3.5,"Very young at first, but really grew on me. Feels slight over priced."

3.0,Has a charred taste from the charred oak barrels.  Definitely has smells of corn. A bit of a bit.  A down the middle bourbon w some rough smokiness

2.0,"**Appearance:** Amber, like an ale or apple juice. 

**Nose:** alcohol, varnish, only the slightest sweetness of corn.

**Palate:** what I’d image baseball bats taste like if puréed into a smoothie. Sharp pine tar, wood, no sweetness.

**Finish:** acid spice. Saved by its shortness.

**Overall:** I had some of this at a bar and enjoyed it, so I bought a bottle. Now I’m thinking they poured me something different. I can see why the wax cap on this bottle was so hard to open. It was a defense mechanism. Now I have to hope my sink gets clogged so I have a use for this. I don’t like wasting."
4.0,"The corn mash creates a sweet, butter forward flavor that plays well in the front palate. The nose has buttered popcorn and Carmel.  The finish is smooth and velvety.  Almost no spicy qualities."

3.25,"Young, somewhat overpirced. Very long finish with spicy dominating most of the palate."

4.0,Heavy sweet corn taste and smell with a tinge of vanilla and oak. Initially thick and rich but thins out and shortens as your ice melts.

3.5,"This bourbon is all about sweetness. I’d call it sweet heat. It’s a “simple” sweeteness, coming from the corn and it’s got heat like moonshine. The barrel notes are all in the nose and the finish is short and sweet"
3.0,Overpowering corn

2.5,"Full disclosure, it was a limited taste, a free sample at Costco. So keep that in mind when I say that it tasted like someone sprinkled Splenda on a can of corn and aged it for 12 seconds. Whiskey flavored vodka comes to mind."

5.0,Slight nut taste at first then turns to an Oaky and tobacco finishing with a nice return heat.

3.0,Very different taste. Not a huge fan.
4.5,"Exciting, exotic, impressive. My new Journey in Bourbon finally gave me something to feel happy: Hudson Baby. 

This New York 100%corn Bourbon, doesn't taste like a bourbon, actually it doesn't taste like any whisky i have had before.

Bottled at 46%abv, it has a beautiful Mahogany Color.

On the nose, it is one of those ""Jack Daniels"". Grapes, Wine, a little wood, maybe a slight smoke, Smells just like Jack Daniel's Old No. 7 or Johnnie Walker Select Cask Rye Finish.

On the palate is where everything happens. Strange Flavors never before found: First of all it has a GUAVA JUICE NOTE. In Ecuador we call this Guayaba in Spanish, i look it up in English and it is Guava. but made Juice. We drink that in breakfast, is popular. Also it felt like a ""little Tomato"" (spanish: Tomatillo) Juice. also for breakfast lol.

A little Oily, like Kerosene (have i ever tried Kerosene? i would be dead if i did i think), incredibly spicy, but not pepper or cinammon, it is like WASABI. 

Thick, full bodied, almost edible rather than drinkable. Mouth Watering with a very long bitter and spicy end. 

Absolutely impressive, exotic, this is not for every day, it is not for 3 or 4 drinks in a row, this is just something that is there for you to have once every month to experience something different. 90 out of 100. cheers"
3.5,"Strange bird. Different times seem to lend different experiences. In general though the richness/complexity is actually pretty decent with the smokey barrel aspects pairing with the corn/grain sweetness. The main weakness for me was that it can get overshadowed at times by the alcoholic harshness. For the price I would expect it to be a bit more smooth than this. Still, it is enjoyable, and good if you are in the mood for a bit of a bite."
