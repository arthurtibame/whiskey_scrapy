1.75,"Are you kidding me with these reviews? For the great reviews at a budget price, I thought I couldn’t go wrong. Could barely get through a single pour neat. Nose: sweet singed flesh.
Palate: melted plastic.
Finish: testicle cancer"

4.0,"The nose is very alcohol rich but pleasant.
First taste is the same as the nose but very very smooth for being 100 proof. I have thoroughly enjoyed this neat as well as in a mixed drink!"
4.5,"My favorite whiskey on the shelf right now. Smooth, sweet, and definitely the rye drinkers bourbon. The nose has more alcohol then you would expect, but that doesn’t come through on the palate. So balanced, so drinkable."

4.5,"I was lucky enough to try this by a good friend and it was awesome! The 50% doesn't show on the nose and the tasting notes are smooth considering the higher abv. Definitely robust but, sweet sipper."
3.5,"Finally got around to buying a bottle of this to much mixed fanfare.  Some love it, some seem to hate it, and most seem pissed that the price jumped. Nose comes as vanilla and a bit of nuttiness to me.  Taste is not quite what I expected.  Starts with a full bodied almost fruity quality then morphs into a pepperness you would normally find in a very high rye mash. This slowly burns off to a slow cinnamon heat finish. Overall glad I tried it, but doesn't hit the mark on my expectations. Just seems like this one is a bourbon that wants to be a rye when it grows up, but got lost along the way."

3.75,"Look, this was pretty good when I bought it in January 2019 for $27. First few pours I noted as “nice and complex for this price point.” The next 60% of the bottle was terrible—the official tasting describes it as “the George Carlin of bourbons,” and I joked that it tasted more like George Carlin himself. I am now on my final 5 pours of the bottle and I’ll tell you, these have been quite good. Much more pitted fruit and complexity again, although this is only best observed in the first few sips. 

People are going nuts over this since it won awards in 2019, but they’re either buying into the hype or appreciating a low price point. This is a good buy for $30, but absolutely not worth the $50-100 it’s currently fetching on the secondary market."

Slick mouthfeel with a wallop of vanilla and oak. Apple shines after the initial vanilla bomb, lending to a nice, if somewhat abrupt, finish. 

Solid bourbon but not worth secondary prices. If finish was longer and had some more complexity, I'd have given it a much higher rating."

Taste: every bit a classic bourbon sweet vanilla taste but with the wonderfully complex charred oak and spice that lingers and reminds you this IS a whiskey.

Finish: almost perfect carryover from the palate, warm without a burn, and leaves you wanting another sip.

Smooth factor: A

2.0,"When first opened it had a nose of bananas and bitter chocolate, and I couldn’t decipher the flavor besides a mild cereal sweetness and a little “roastiness.” The finish was pretty hot. 

After letting it ""breathe"" for a couple weeks and trying it again to see if it has calmed down a bit, the nose developed more chocolate and the banana was gone, the flavor is more caramel, and the finish seems only moderately hot."

4.5,"Scouring the closet last night for something to celebrate the anniversary of the Bottled in Bond Act, I came across a bottle of HMcK10 with a couple pours left in it. I haven't had it in ages (since it got scarce I made myself drink other things), but I was immediately reminded why this was my go-to pour for several years. Sweet Vanilla/Caramel Cream, Eggnog with Nutmeg, and a Musty/Oaky coating finish paired with just enough peppery spice to keep it interesting. I was in a local ABC  recently that had just put a case on the shelf at $37, but knowing I had a couple in reserve I passed. Wishing I would've picked one up now. I've had a couple bottles of this that bordered on stellar and have had none that were less than very good. Well done, Heaven Hill."
4.0,"Happy Bottled In Bond Day distiller friends. Exactly 123 years ago today, Congress found a way to be certain that this glass in front of me wouldn’t kill me. Quickly, that is. And I appreciate that accomplishment, so to celebrate, I’m revisiting a BIB bourbon I had about 2 years ago. I’m also drinking this under U.S. Government supervision. Don’t worry about that last part. 

Fun fact: I’m drinking this tonight from the same Heaven Hill souvenir shot glass that I drank it from 2 years ago at Heaven Hill’s Bourbon Heritage Center in Bardstown. Look at ya boy getting all sentimental. Here’s the review from 2 years ago:

“Very smooth and flavorful, though it packs a punch going down. I get citrus, honey, black pepper. Wooden hints as well.”

The tasting tonight:

Barrel 5757.
Barreled on 8.9.08.

The nose is bourbon basic but done well. Caramel, vanilla, very light oak.

The body is hotter than I expected, and more bitter as well. There’s orange, leather, and salt. For me the orange is the main flavor, whereas the other notes are more of a mouth feel as you transition to the finish. Really wish there was more sugar on that body to pull out that orange more.

Finish is pleasantly spicy. Black pepper, rye, brine. Black pepper is the dominant flavor.

So I’ll give the me from two years ago a fist bump through the TARDIS door. Though I agree with most of the flavors, I think it’s cute I used to think this 100 proof whiskey “packs a punch.” Oh honey...

Edit: I don’t mean to throw too much shade here, but why is this bourbon sought after? It’s good. It’s totally sufficient. Yet, there are literally dozens of better options on shelf right now at freaking Meijer. MEIJER.

Edit 2: BDanner is right about a value buy. I can only think of 2 bottles in this price range I’d rather have, and one of them is equally hard to find. I will likely pick up another if I see it on a shelf, but I would never go hunting online for this guy."

4.5,What a wonderful Bourbon. I have had several bottles of this nectar of the gods and I have not had a bad bottle yet. When I first became interested in Bourbons I had this and it is what I judge all Bourbons against. The taste is amazing it has full flavors of vanilla and caramel it is the first bourbon in which I can taste the flavors I read about. This is also the first higher proof liquor that I have enjoyed neat. The only bad thing I can say about this stuff is that it has nearly doubled in price since I have started drinking it. It deserves a place in your home bar and it ranks right up there with many of the great Bourbons.

4.5,"I was quite surprised by this bourbon.  Considering it's a 10 year-old, I have to compare it to Eagle Rare and the Bulleit 10.  And I must say it has worked its way right up to the top with Eagle Rare for me.  I actually tasted the two back to back and they are basically perfect complements to each other.  Where one lacks, the other makes up for and then some.  Both are beautiful by themselves, but when you have them side by side, you realize there's really nothing else you could ask for.  The McKenna is very full-bodied and rich.  It enters the mouth and it's so smooth you can't really tell it's alcohol until you swallow.  Again, a nice complement to Eagle Rare which stings you right on the tip of the tongue, but bathes your throat in warm velvet as it goes down.  The flavor of the McKenna is quite warm and buttery with some beautiful spice.  This is a very good bourbon and I would love to have it in my collection."

“Caramel-y Goodness”
Every barrel varies slightly and this is an excellent one.  Nose is caramel, butterscotch, slight vanilla, really no proof sting at all.  On the palate this is just waves of caramel, a little butterscotch with a thick viscous mouthfeel.  For me, this barrel is really flavorful with just the right amount of alcohol to bring out the flavor.  Excellent to sit back and savor at the end of the day.

I was able to pick this up after the awards but before the pricing started to get crazy.  This bottle makes me completely understand why the regular McKenna drinkers are upset, at the original SRP this was a gem.  Whether it’s worth paying much over that price is up to the buyer.  Unfortunately with the current Bourbon craze price very often doesn’t equal quality.  For what I paid for this bottle, it is punching above it’s weight class.  I’ll be savoring this one."

4.75,"Neat. Fresh bottle.  Been awhile since I opened a McKenna 10 year.  Delicious oak with a hint of peanuts shells on the nose.  The age is really coming through on this pour.  Orange peel and burnt caramel.  The oak is morphing into this delightful milk chocolate.  Little hint of pepper and mint.

Oh hell yeah.  This is by far the best McKenna I have had.  Immediately on the tongue,  the brown sugars, cinnamon come together to form a pronounced cinnamon roll.  All those flavors from the nose start coming forward.  Burnt caramel, orange peel and chocolate.  Legs bring back those intense brown sugars and cinnamon from the start and they linger for quite a while.  That peanut comes around on the taste the more I sit with it.

This is barrel 6716.  It’s awesome.  I am shocked.  The last McKenna I had was a dud but this one restores my faith."
3.75,"Nose - banana, cinnamon, rye spices, dry vanilla, clove, bubble gum, eucalyptus, moderate/high ethanol burn. 

Taste - eucalyptus, licorice, bubble gum, dry rye spices, oak notes, clove, black pepper, banana, vanilla, menthol, moderate alcohol bite, finishing fairly long with oak, spicy rye, and dry vanilla and banana flavors. 

As anticipated, the reality doesn’t quite live up to the hype. However, for $40 (if you can find it for that), it’s a really solid high rye bourbon. In a blind test, I’d probably peg it for a high corn rye, similar to Pikesville. As many others have said, don’t pay secondary prices for it, but if you happen across it at or around $40, I think it’s worth the price."

3.5,"In sunny Los Angeles, a bottle of Henry McKenna 10 is as rare a sight as sidewalks without homeless people.  When I found this online at a local liquor store, I had this bad boy delivered the very same hour.

The initial palate is cola sweet and cinnamon spicy at the same time.  The spice builds up as the oak makes an entry, leading to a Dr. Pepper note.  The finish is where the spice and 50% ABV meld, leaving the mouth quite dry.  By the third sip, the standard bourbon notes of vanilla and caramel take center stage - but the finish remains as mouth tingling and drying as before.  For the fourth sip, I added a couple of drops of water and the sweetness was amplified, while the spice provided a nice zing in the background.  (It was kind of like tasting sweets on a fast moving train, while eyeing the landscape as it zipped past.)  As a bourbon, this has quite the dynamic flavor profile.  

However, as I paid over twice the MSRP for this (barreled in 2009), my review may be a bit skewed. But this is a unique bourbon without a doubt.  

Should you pay what I did for one?  I can't recommend it at over $70.  But, if you're an enthusiast and can find one in the $50-$60 range, it's a no brainer, pick it up - no questions asked.

1. Disgusting - So bad I poured it out.
2. Poor - I wouldn't consume by choice.
3. Bad - Multiple flaws.
4. Below average - Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.
5. Good - Just average.
6. Very Good - Better than average.
7. Great - Well above average.
8. Excellent - In a league of its own.
9. Incredible - An all-time favorite.
10. Perfect"
3.75,"I think Phil and Deepa from Whiskey Mystery described this best as a perfume for trees. The nose is elegant with some personality. It's bright, caramel, and bitter oaky. On the finish, I get syrupy coca-cola and alcohol notes.  At 50 abv this is a sweet and easy drinker with a little bit of an alcohol bite. 

At under $40, I would consider getting this again."

3.0,I will give this bottling 2 more chances. I've tried 4 or 5 different bottling of this and it's just not been good. I want what everyone else is experiencing I love all bourbons and can find things I like about any and this one I do appreciate the nose but taste just isnt there.

3.75,Spicy and vanilla on the nose. Smooth full pallet. Long spicy finish
4.0,"First crack of the bottle - nose reminds me of the old Forster profile at first - peanut, oak, spice, vanilla.  In between 1910 and 1920 (sweet like 10, oak like 20).  It gets sweeter as it breathes for a few minutes - caramel, a little ethanol.  First sip is dark caramel, leather, oak and a hint of sour mash and ethanol.  Pretty smooth for 100 proof - only mild heat and no bite.  Revisiting the nose and palate there something a bit medicinal in there, almost like a spearmint?

Finish is medium length, warm and balanced with vanilla and oak as well as some tobacco/earthy tones.  It reminds me of another 10yr - Eagle rare but a bit more marshmallow sweetness?.  Something that would be fantastic with a cigar...

Also like eagle rare this is solid at $30 bu sadly cost me $45.  It’s an easy drinker that is like to keep around but nothing is trade any ECBP, Bookers or other full-proof NCF bourbon for (which are hands down favorites for me)."

4.5,"Bright Copper in color. Aroma of baking spice with cinnamon and vanilla centered. First thought in first sip was herbal, touch of mint and a bit if pine.  This settles to a nutty almond mid palate that lingers to the finish.  Fruit opens up and vanilla takes the stage in the flavor. Black pepper on the finish. I had a moment of ripe banana. Few drops of water were a pleasant surprise. Chocolate, cinnamon come forward a bit with a hint of clove. Righteous oily mouthfeel. Late in the glass moments of honey and marzipan.  Really Nice."

Palate is pretty nice with oak, caramel, and tobacco.

Finish is somewhat bitter and astringent. Definitely doesn’t draw you back in.

Nothing to write home about but single barrels can differ with each bottle. This bottle was just meh."

3.5,"Good but not great. Had hunted this one for a while and got my hands on one. Price was far at $35 but with all the hype I was expecting more. Very sweet on the nose with lots of alchohol that dies into a sweet floral body and a minty finish. Would buy again but with lower expectations. Personally, I think there are better bottles that are easier to find in and around this price range."

4.0,Long long finish
4.0,"Henry Mckenna Single Barrel 10 year Bottled-in-Bond is an amazing bourbon at a great price point. The high proof bourbon is one of the few bottled-in-bond whiskeys still on the market today. Matured for 10 long years in new charred American White Oak barrels in a federal warehouse, this bourbon is bottled at 100 proof/50% ABV. The mashbill is similar to other Heaven Hill expressions produced at 75% corn, 13% rye, 12% malted barley. A great bourbon but just a touch too spicy in my opinion.

Color: Deep Copper

On the nose are hints of caramel, burnt vanilla, cinnamon rolls, baking spices, orange citrus, and some floral notes. The palate is spices with hints of vanilla, cinnamon, fruity citrus, and floral notes. The finish is long and spicy with some good warmth and oakiness."
4.5,"Bottled in bond offering that greets with a nose of brown sugar and vanilla, bringing to mind a kitchen full of cooking baking. Mint and bright citrus, orange, lemon, and grapefruit, dance along the palate early and often. These flavors return with each sip to pop on the tongue before getting rounded off by the same sugary desserts from the nose, caramel and butterscotch among them. A touch of rye spice makes an appearance on the mid-palate, adding dimension and inter playing with the earlier lighter notes. Refined leather and light oak come on late, contributing to a long, textural finish. This bourbon is capable of being whatever you need it to be while drinking well above it’s weight at around $35."

3.75,"Vanilla, Banana, a slight hint of cinnamon. Initial taste is harsh but as the sip disperses across the tongue, the banana flavor comes to the front. As the bourbon settles, it is smooth and creamy. Slightly oily feeling which makes for a good pour!"
4.25,smooth sipper.....banana spice with a nice oak finish.  rich feel and a lacy drip ring on my glass.  I’d revisit again no question if price stays put.

The sweet gives way to a slight spice, a lingering burn on the tongue that makes you wonder if you're tasting mint or more orange. So you go back for more."
