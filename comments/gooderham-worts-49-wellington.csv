4.0,"Red oak and red wheat gives it a lovely finish full of spice and sweetness.  

I had a sample and then decided to buy a full bottle.  Good call.  The age and the wheat mesh soft wheat and wood spice.  Medium to long finish that is slightly warming and spicy. 

The nose is sweetness and oak, Canadian but so well balanced with no noticeable raw alcohol notes despite being 49%. 

Simply delicious."
