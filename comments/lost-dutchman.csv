4.0,"It's always really great when I can review a local Whiskey that exceeds my expectations... This rye definitely does that! It's 100 grain to glass with all components sourced locally in Arizona. Mashbill is unique with 90% local grown AZ Rye and 10% local Durum Wheat. It's bottled at a healthy 47.5% ABV. Let's dive in...

Sweet with a spice filled back bone... Smooth but let's you know your drinking a strong spirit... Young but wise beyond it's years.... An explosion of baking spices, marshmallows, vanilla and lovely long oak and spice filled finish....

This Lost Dutchman is a standout from Adventurous Stills! Unique, tasty and an excellent example of a well executed craft Whiskey!!

This one stands tall next to the Del Bac Dorado as the standard bearers of AZ Whiskey!!

Cheers All!"
