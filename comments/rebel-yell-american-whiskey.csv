2.0,"I really wanted to like this. I thought that the rye with the wheat would be something unique. In the end, all I tasted was the rye spice and the alcohol. It just didn't do it for me. And at $25, I can think of a at least a dozen other whiskies I'd rather buy. It wasn't terrible, but it just didn't do it for me."
3.0,Thin and a bit light on flavor/complexity. Sweetness with a little spice (I think?) not bad at all for the price. Better than Jack or Jim and cheaper

2.25,"Great spicy addition to the base Rebel that we all know and love, like spear from a bayonet and a tad of napalm finish. 6/22/17."
2.5,Very sweet and very spicy. Great to sip neat or in a cocktail. Not a lot of depth but not a bad whiskey by any means.
