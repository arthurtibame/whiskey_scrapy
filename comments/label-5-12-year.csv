4.0,"A really easy and ejoyable dram, sweet and inviting; lovely on the nose and not harsh at all in the palate. This is a blended scotch whisky but mainly sold in france, with Glen Moray as its mother malt.

Bottled at 40% abv, chesnut oloroso sherry note.

On the nose it is very sweet, almost as a dessert. Sweet cinnamon, hazelnut, cooked fruit, mostly cooked apples with cinnamon and sugar, as a hot apple pie. Sweet honey/caramel/cinnamon note, very pleasant. No alcohol note at all, creamy on the nose. cereal notes are there too. 

On the palate starts sweet with honey/pudding caramel notes. Very plesant notes of herbal vanilla, very slight new oak, very balanced between spicyness and sweetness, not complex at all. It is very creamy, reminds me a lot about honey corn flakes. 

Aftertaste is medium long, cinnamon spice but not harsh at all. There is a slight heat in the throat but nothing that burns. Dim hints of clove also present.

This is a good dram and it is clearly why is France's favorite blended whisky. 85 over 100, for a blended, pretty nice score."
