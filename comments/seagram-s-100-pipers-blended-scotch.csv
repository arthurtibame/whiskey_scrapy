1.0,"A whisky that will always suit the budget, but not worth the hang over.  Strong pungent vanilla scent, bad after taste, numbness on the tongue, and not smooth on its own.  Mixers are required to drink this.  
Not a great whisky!

3.0,"Somewhat pale, golden appearance, with typical alcohol legs. Aroma is of sweet grains and underlying peat smoke, with some wax. Taste is of those elements, as well, and the smokiness helps along the main filler body. The mouthfeel is high medium, and 100 Pipers finishes mild and mellow. RJT"
