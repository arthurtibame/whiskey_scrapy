2.0,"Tasted 10/15/2014 : Somewhat sweet nose with acetone (?), sea salt (reminds me of Great South Bay).  On the palate, I found it to be briny with a bite.  Addition of water rounded the bite but enhanced the briny quality.  Probably best over ice.  Not bad for under $30."

3.0,"I really enjoyed this Scotch when I picked it up at All Star liquor store in Smith River California. This Scotch smells very reminiscent of sugar cookies and toffee. It is a very refreshing scent that sets you up for what one would imagine to be a sweet smooth Scotch. But this is not the case. This is, as my friend David says, is an ""angry Scotch"". The Prohibition Edition Scotch is very spicy reminiscent of cracked black pepper or chili peppers. So, so good! A must have if you can find!"

2.0,"Vanilla, oak, lemon, allspice, with a hint of liquorice. Has a prolonged, searing white pepper finish. Better with a little water. It has a slight industrial petrol note reminiscent of some aged Cuban rums. I wouldn't drink it neat, and it didn't seem to fare well with simple mixers. However, a crafty bartender could doubtless make it shine in any number of concoctions."

It is actually interesting"": fruit, a tiny hint of peat and the 100 proof helps as well, potent without harshness.  I find it much better than many ""bottom shelf single malts"" such as Glenfiddich 12, I think there might always be one in my cabinet, unless I find a better alternative under $30..."

4.0,"Back as a young kid sitting in rear seat of my dad’s gas guzzling Chevy Nova, I remember seeing these Cutty Sark billboards all through the Jersey Turnpiike.  I always wondered what’s this bottle called “cutie shark”?  I even then named my toy pirate ship The Cutie Shark.  In retrospect, no decent pirate worth his salt and respect would name a ship like that, but anyway...that was the world of a 5 year old.  Then much later in life, age 14, I bought my first bottle of liquor.  Not to drink...but to use in my science experiment, to show how alcohol can be used instead of gas engines for cars.  That bottle was a Cutty Sark.  ( technically, my dad bought it).  Much much much later in life, now that I have 450+ bottles of whisk(e)y, I always treated Cutty Sark like a snob.  Telling myself that “why would I want a pour of this bottom shelf piss and take a hit to my liver, when I can have a single malt?’  Yeah...a snob.  But I did have a pour of this recently.  And I so,stand corrected.  It’s actually freakin good.  Granted, it’s no blend at the level of Glaser’s creations, but it’s damn good nonetheless.  Cherries and red fruit complement a nice backbone of heather and honey.  A tiny bit of smoke, just a whiff.  I gotta say, some of these blends that I considered bottom shelf “piss” are coming out with variants that are really affordable (sub $40) and just well made...the Jack Daniels Single Barrel Barrel Strength comes to mind first and foremost.  Well done my merry band of “cutie shark “ pirates ..."

  It tasted like Johnnie walker black, without the fruitiness and with more peat and smoke. It taste like a more refined version of black grouse. It's quite enjoyable

3.0,"50% abv
color added
Non-chill-filtered

Nose: fruity (apple, slight pear), cinnamon spice, with a hint of alcohol sharpness. 

Taste: fairly oily and sweet, with a big hit of peppery-cinnamon spice, toffee, vanilla, red apple, plum, hint of citrus and slight earthy peat smokiness too.

Finish: pretty short, with rich cinnamon and sweet fruit, hint of barrel char and smoke.

Value: $25-35 USD. Not bad at all.

Final thoughts: This is a blended scotch made for cocktails. This would stand up nicely in a Rob Roy at 50% abv, but also ain't too shabby neat. In fact, I don't mind this one bit neat, but for the price, there are cheaper blends out there that can also do the trick at lower abv. Start your flight with this one to set your palate up for the good stuff.

Final score: 3/5 (Recommend trying or buying a bottle at a good price)

4.0,"I have read and seen several decent reviews of this blend. Finally was able to purchase it on sale so it wasn't a huge gamble. No, this is not a top notch Macallan or Glenmorangie single malt; but, it delivers what it promises. It is a blend of youthful malts and grain whisky. There must be a high proportion of malt for it has a great mouthfeel. the most noticed flavor is of malt and butter-toffee, usually true for young whiskies. There are touches of ripe fruit, sherry, smoke, and peppery oak. At 100 proof it can be a little hot; a small dash of water to lower the proof to 90 takes away the heat, but does not diminish the flavor.  More water and the flavor completely falls apart.  Overall, a very pleasant and not too complicated dram. If you can get it at a good price it is a bargain. However, many retailers are charging prices on par with good single malts. Don't do that.  I got mine on sale under $15."

4.25,"Nose: Caramel, peat, non-specific spices
Starts high on caramel, then the peat comes out. Spice on taste is reminiscent of gentle pepper, like pink pepper. Very mellow for 50% ABV. Soft drinker, definitely worth the asking price."
3.75,"Wow, this is very tasty, packs a lot of flavours. Decided to pick this one up after some good reviews here on Distiller and I'm very glad I did! This is a steal for only 35 CAD$. Nice toffee, pears and black licorice on the palate, I also get the black pepper note that they discribe on the bottle. Non chillfiltered, 50% ABV, a medium finish. This is the best blended Scotch I had so far! Cheers"

4.25,"Toffee on the nose and also on the palate, some deep peat smoke underneath that gives it that scotch taste. Rich and oily texture, the spice comes from black pepper and it's a little bit too high-proof so it has a lot of burn, but the richness makes it okay. Needs just a tiny bit of water to cut the burn. Still very nice, love the balance between spice and sweet."
0.25,"This is hands down the worst scotch whisky I’ve ever had. 

Nose: toffee, pepper, alcohol, and grappa (yes, grappa). I promise you, if this were a blind scent test you would not guess it were a scotch. I certainly wouldn’t. A grappa or high ABV white rum. 

Taste: First and foremost, young. Wouldn’t be surprised if it weren’t a day past 3 years old. Alcohol, spicy, licorice, a little sweet. Not a hint of peat or smoke, contrary to other reviews I’ve read. 

Finish: licorice, oily 

Bottles at 50% and 100 proof - at 35$ CAD, I was really hoping this would be my benchmark bottom shelf scotch. The search continues."
3.5,"Nose: Intense leathery malt, caramel and toasted cereal grains. Squill candy, honey and yeasty ale. Machine oil and moist earth. A definite alcohol hit, but it doesn't burn. Some oak in the background. It's a robust nose and more forward than most blended scotch noses.
                
Palate: A warm, full oaked arrival with smoky tones in the background. As it develops, a rich peppery sweetness emerges with hints of brown sugar, bittersweet orange oil and brine. There is some dark bittersweet chocolate, treacle toffee and hard strong licorice as well. The texture is full and rich like a strong espresso.
                
Finish: Long. As all the spice dies down the pleasant rich brown sugar sweetness slowly fades away leaving just the forceful sherried oak that lies at the heart of this blend.
                
Damn, this is a good blend. I wonder if it's really like what they drank off the boat back in the bad old days of prohibition? It seems a bit too modern.
                
It has a very full character that is immensely satisfying and remarkably like that of a highly-sherried Speyside malt. I'd be willing to bet my bottom dollar that there is a ton of Glenrothes in this (but I prefer it to any Glenrothes I've ever had).
        
A dash of water does no harm to it whatsoever, this is a blend that swims well and water just softens it. Recommended neat or with water (or even with ice and a splash of soda).
                
I'd been putting this one off for a while but after tasting it this afternoon I took a stroll to my local liquor shop and picked up another bottle to save for the future. That should be all you need to know.
            
PS - The 50% abv strength is a major contributor to the success of this blend. It make me wonder what some of the more pedestrian, bottom-shelf blends might be like at high proof.

4.0,"So I want to thank @PBMichiganWolverine for his review of this that spurred my purchase. My grandfather died while I was young. I’m frequently told that I remind my family of him yet I have little to no memory of him. I spoke with an old timer who knew him a couple years ago who informed me he drank Cutty Sark by the case. Being the ridiculous Scotch snob I absurdly think I am I could never pull the trigger on the bottom shelf brand. After reading @PBMichiganWolverine review I finally pulled the trigger on this expression. Not only is it really amazing, it has made me feel like I have a link to the past. Nose is a sweet sour wood, but the palate explodes with an oily black pepper savory brine and medium to long finish.  It’s not a phoned in thin tolerable blend. This is a great whisky for a ridiculously low price. Can’t wait to get another bottle."

3.5,"I really enjoyed this one. light peat, almost sherried notes. surprisingly easy drinking at 50 abv. Im going to have to find a bottle for myself. Thanks Jo!"
3.75,"It was the sagacious @PBMichiganWolverine who convinced me to give this a try. My initial exposure to Cutty Sark's standard bottle was my great aunt Evelyn fancying it; being the good country Texas family that we are, I mostly saw her drinking this on the rocks out of a coffee mug, because we're classy. My grandmother used to drink her Franzia white grenache from a box in an old pickle jar, after all. At some point later in my life, I bought a bottle and was underwhelmed...and that was even before I developed an interest in quality spirits.

But, when someone whose palate I trust says this is good...well, I had to try. And, folks aren't wrong - this is an affordable blended Scotch that majorly overdelivers. The nose reminds me of cookie dough, sweet and rich with vanilla, but there's a maritime quality hanging on around the edge, letting you know that this is going to be a more complex affair than the average cheap blend. The palate is oily and coating, with that Christmas cookie sweetness leading the way, eventually yielding to a salty, citrusy profile that, by the finish, lets up enough to allow a certain sherry-tinged note to be heard. In the words of Stefon, this whisky has *everything*. Sure, it's a little hot at this proof, and I'm not going to choose this over a worthwhile single malt, but for $24 a bottle, there is nothing to complain about here."

3.25,null
3.5,"Appearance: Looking at this peated blend I note the color of polished brass, with the appearance of thin oily legs in the glass after a swirl.

Nose: The nose overall is fruity and smokey. Delicious notes of candied pecan, salty sea air, dusty old book, lemon zest, ginger root, earl grey tea, and apple pie reward one’s curious sniff.

Taste: The palate has an oily mouthfeel, with notes of salty peat, plum, cinnamon, spice, and ash.

Finish: The finish is lingering and mellow with a fresh clove note left behind.

Thoughts: I am quite impressed with this scotch. Several folks have recommended this to me lately, so I’m glad I finally got the opportunity to try it. For the price point, I’d say this is an excellent deal! I love the peat’s presence but for those just getting into the peat taste, it isn’t overbearing. I ended up getting a bottle for a friend of mine and he loved it too. The bottle is classy, the value is great, and the scotch is good! Thank you, Cutty Sark! Sláinte!"

3.5,"A rock and roller August/September!  Vacation, family tragedies, back to school, traveling, hurricanes, work and more work, engagements. All this has kept me away from tasting (definitely not drinking). Been trolling but haven’t been much of a contributor.   Tonight I will contribute my Cutty Sark experience. A lower cost, blended scotch that is hard(er) to find.  Had this opened for sometime and this seemed the perfect pour for me tonight. 

Salty, briny, maritime opening transports you right to a South Carolina salt marsh during a late afternoon.  Blended with the brine is a subtle sweetness of candy corn, apples, pears and butterscotch. Ginger snaps, lemon zest lightly provide a spicy citrus note and compliments the brine and sweet. 

On arrival, a curiously odd mixture of cream soda and black pepper swirl about.  Keep swirling and chewing as it brings forward peanut brittle, orange bitters and wood spice.  A slightly weighted and creamy body delivers the sweet and spice. 

What remains on the palate is wood, spice and sugar (whipped honey butter).  A warmed soul ultimately remains. 

This is a solid whisky that has a good balance of sweet, savory and spice. Easy to drink with  simplex complexity with solid pricing.  Perfect for those pours you want where you can just enjoy in any occasion; all packed at 50%. [85/100][Tasted: 9/20/19][$39]"
2.0,"Recommended to me as the best affordable blended scotch for cocktails.  Price is certainly great, but this was kind of a bummer.

Nose: Sweet fruit, sharp alcohol
Palate: SWEET.  Slick.  Toffee. Butterscotch. Somewhat fruity.  Not enough smoke or character.
Finish: Sweet (still); some spices and alcohol, but only whisps of smoke.

Verdict: Sugar bomb. Not enough spice or smoke. Monkey Shoulder is a better buy.  $15 was clearance. I think bottles that are less than 2x the cost deliver far more than 2x the experience. I want to like this so bad. Might be OK in cocktails."

3.0,"I received this bottle as a birthday present back in early March from my friend Paul.  I believe he had tried this before and thought I’d enjoy it, and knowing I don’t usually buy cheaper blends, he decided to make this part of my gift this year.  Many thanks, @Generously_Paul.

The Prohibition Edition is a throwback blend that differs mostly from the normal Cutty Sark simply by upping the ABV to 50%, from the typical 40%.  It’s sunset gold in the tasting glass with tiny beads and sparse legs.  It’s also quite slick and oily.  I believe this bottle runs about $35 locally.

The nose is predominantly butterscotch, heavy malt and candied corn.  There’s some caramel and light citrus rounding things out.  I mostly came away smelling butterscotch candies, however, even given some time in the Glencairn.

The palate had a raw peanut aspect, along with toffee and butterscotch chews.  There was some pepper spice creeping in by mid sip and the oily mouth coat left those pepper and alcohol notes stuck to my tongue.

The finish was long and sweet, with vanilla and buttered bread hanging around, along with a lingering warmth and hint of pepper.

Overall, this is the poster child for one dimensional malts.  The butterscotch candy notes never wavered.  The price point is excellent and the boosted ABV will hold up nicely in cocktails or over a few ice cubes.  I’m just not as in love with this malt as a lot of reviewers seem to be.  Yes, it’s easily approachable, cheap and crushable- it just doesn’t do much for me.  I’d give it a solid 3 stars just on price and punch, but I don’t think this is a bottle I need to replace or keep around.  Cheers."

3.75,"Nose: orchard fruits, cream, a little ash, some acetone
Taste: lemon candy, mint, a whiff of smoke, 
Finish: dry, fairly hot
After reading reviews: didn’t get the baking spices.  Finished it before reading that so will have to revisit- looking forward to it."
3.75,"Re-review.

Nose: Prominent malt and caramel toffee with almost burnt sugar notes. Toasted cereal grains, an aroma reminiscent of cask-conditioned ale. Squill candy, sherry, honey, oil and dunnage earth. A little oak note. It's hard to believe this is a blended scotch nose.

Palate: A warm, slightly sweet and oaky arrival with smoky tones in the background. As it develops, a wave of rich peppery sweetness emerges with hints of brown sugar, orange oil and brine. There is some dark bittersweet chocolate, treacle toffee and hard licorice as well to balance the palate. The texture is full and rich like a strong espresso. I noticed more licorice on the late development than the last time I tasted this. Again, really excellent structure for a blended scotch.

Finish: Long. As the spicy and brown sugar notes fade you are left with a forceful sherry oak character that is almost rancio and an anise aftertaste. 

My last tasting of this was about 6 months ago, but this isn't a bottle-kill review - that bottle hardly lasted a fortnight and I predict this current one will expire just as quickly.

What a great blended scotch. It really is hard to believe it's not a malt blend. Compared to Monkey Shoulder and Naked Grouse this much more assertive, and it could fairly square-off against the standard Compass Box blends.  Highly recommended, it's not cheap but it's worth every penny - great for sipping and a wonderful mixer, it's just barely short of 4 stars.

""Good"" : 3.75 stars"

4.25,"I saw this bottle originally in a Youtube video and was quite fascinated. Luckily, when I tracked it down in a local wine shop, they were selling it at a same price level as the original Cutty Sark. 

The aroma of the dram was the pinch hitter for me in my opinion. I got a burnt or crispy toast notes with a healthy dollop of honey and in between those notes, I've picked up a nutty and chocolate notes as well. The peat levels rise when tasting the dram. Got a whole lot of heathery peat kind of like Highland Park 12. The honey on the nose kind of evolves into this butterscotch character. Finish is medium at best with the toasty honey bread vibe that last a good 6 to 7 seconds before fading.

I got to say one of my favorite blended scotch whisky of all time. I just really hope they can restock more soon."
4.0,"I've been meaning to try this one for a while. It has been discontinued in NC, so I purchased the lone bottle my local ABC store had at a closeout of $25. 
It pours into the Glencairn a medium straw color. A quick swirl gives the glass an oily coating and forms slow moving legs.
*Nose: Interesting. There is a lot going on here. It's definitely Oak Heavy. Vanilla Malt sweetness. Buttery Cake Batter. Fruitiness that hints at it being sherry'd. There is a hint of smoke, but if there is peat here, there's not much. I keep coming back to nose the glass and I pick up something new and interesting every time. Am I really smelling those big Orange Marshmallow Circus Peanuts? Why does it remind me of Root Beer? Am I sampling scotch or rum? Very nice.
*Neat: Nice heavy, oily mouthfeel. Huge hit of sweetness. Vanilla Custard, Butterscotch, and Toffee. Very sweet, but not cloying. Again, I could almost swear that something in here spent time in rum barrels. Some Sherry Fruitiness and just the lightest wisp of smoke round it out. There is a slightly sour note on the backend just before the peppery, slightly hot finish. A pleasant Oak and Vanilla coating lingers.
*Splash: A little water brings the Fruit notes to the forefront on both the nose and palate, while adding a chocolate note to the finish. 
*Verdict: Wow. I wish I would've given this a try sooner. It's been a while since I've had a Blended scotch, but I really don't remember enjoying it as much as I enjoyed this one. I may have to see if I can find another bottle or two floating around somewhere before they're all gone."

3.25,"It doesn’t smell like Scotch. It’s got a sweet sherry smell to it. On the tongue, it’s less sweet and dry. Toffee, caramel, and spice."
