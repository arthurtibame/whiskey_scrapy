1.0,"You would think this a step-up from the Special Reserve and Black Barrel varietals, but when we had this as a part of a Jameson tasting, I noticed that a number of people left this glass mostly full. I found out why when we sampled ours - it tasted like musty feet and age (like grandma's attic.)"

4.0,"Nose - toasted black tea, barley, cereals. Faint hit of wet cut grass that's been sitting a few days, slightly musty. Dried longans.
  Taste - Very light vanilla, light caramel, baked pears with honey. Slightly thin mouthfeel but very smooth and buttery.
  Finish - Slight light oak with almost a fruity tea mixed with toasted/charred melons. 82/100"

4.0,Of the 3 or 4 bottles of top shelf premium liqour I have bought in search of a smooth sipping whiskey I have to say this is quite nice. I have a hard time sniffing to get the aroma off of it but that doesn't work as the vapor on any alcohol burns my sinuses so I have to rely on taste. Being one of the cheaper ones I have bought I really like it for the taste and the smoothness of it. Has a nice aftertaste that is mellow and not overpowering. It is actually my preference to choose this one over one that I have paid over twice as much for.

null,"Jameson Gold Reserve is a Blended Irish Whiskey from the Midleton Distillery in Cork. The Gold Reserve is comprised of three different pot still whiskeys and one grain whiskey. Out of the pot still whiskeys, one is aged in virgin American oak barrels from 8-10 years, one in ex-bourbon for 10-20 years and one in ex-sherry from 10-12 years. The grain whiskey component is aged mainly in ex-bourbon with some virgin American oak elements. 

Nose - Fragrant wood, rich pot still with a touch of sherry sweetness.
Taste - All the creaminess and honey sweetness come together to create a taste sensation of spicy character, a smooth complex whiskey experience. 
Finish - A very long finish with a pleasantly peppery finale.

4.0,"Beautiful dram. On the nose you get this creamy vanilla, sherry notes, on the palate is hot not peppery. You can also get chocolate, some dried fruits, wood on the palate for a medium finish which is hot. Is a nice balanced whiskey. Give it a drop of water, it will release most aromas and it will make the palate more likeable. my first irish. good experience"

3.0,"Early in my whiskey-drinking days, Jameson's standard bottling was my go to. When I saw the Gold Reserve, I assumed that this would be the pinnacle of all whiskey. Obviously, I had a lot to learn. Still, upon hearing that this had been discontinued, I felt compelled to try this  before it was all but gone; if for no other reason, to satisfy the curiosity of my novice-self. So, let's see if this can live up to those lofty expectations.

Nose: Quite grainy. Shortbread cookie, vanilla, and apple. Roasted nuts, macadamia, and almond. Sweet and floral. Caramel, toffee, and malt. Not complex or groundbreaking, but pleasant. It's very subdued and even a bit boring at first but manages to brighten up with time in the glass. Didn't care for it at first, but it's grown on me significantly.

Palate: Vanilla, honey, toffee, malt, shortbread cookie. Some red apple and golden raisin. None of the grainy metallic notes I often find in Irish. This is obviously well-aged stock. Instead of the metallic notes, it's a grapefruit bitter note. Even some vegetal notes; maybe cucumber (I've only ever gotten grapefruit and cucumber in tequilas, which makes this interesting).The nutty notes from the nose come through again. This is the definition of easy-going. It may not be the most complex, but it is very enjoyable and remarkably easy to put down.

Finish: Relatively short but does provide a bit of much-welcomed heat. Cinnamon and black pepper. Clove and nutmeg. Prominent oak.

Where to begin with my analysis? I'll say this. It's good. I enjoyed it. $95 good? No. Worthy of the ostentatious title of ""Gold Reserve?"" Not particularly. Does this aspire to the level of quality that my novice-mind once imposed upon this product? Not only no, but hell no.

Perfectly enjoyable background whiskey. That's all. 40% ABV really holds this one back. It's better than the Black Barrel if you don't factor VFM. But if you do, if score the latter an entire half a point higher. And the Cooper's Croze is just outright better. Ultimately, that is the superior option for Jameson NAS releases.

So obviously, I won't too disappointed when this has disappeared from the shelves altogether. Jameson is obviously moving in the right direction with their higher-end releases using the Cooper's Croze as a reference point. My expectations had diminished long before I ever purchased a bottle; however, it's good enough where I'm glad I got to try it before it's all but forgotten. Cheers!"
