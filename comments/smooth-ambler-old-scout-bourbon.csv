5.0,"Got this for Christmas. Never heard of it before, it was highly recommended by the guy in the bourbon section of Total Wine. 
I have to say for being a high rye (36%) it's exceptionally smooth. There is a forward bite being 99 proof, but quickly smooths out to a sweet tingling finish. After opening up it has a bubble gum/cotton candy scent to the nose. But the flavor is never that sweet. It's a perfect mix of tingle to smooth transition as it goes down. Highly recommend you give this one a try."

3.0,"Rye spice is prominent. Seems hotter than other 100 proof bourbons I've had. Dry finish. A few drops of water tamed it but it was still dry and spicy. Nothing wrong with it though. It's just not for fans of sweet, easy-drinking whiskeys."

5.0,"One of my favourite bourbons, a full round intense nose and mouthful, delicious long finish"
3.0,"NOSE: Lots of vanilla, little bit of date or plum maybe, and some cinnamon. A little strong on the alcohol for the proof. Nice, not overly complex.  PALATE: Classic bourbon flavors, sweet, caramel and vanilla, nice cinnamon notes a little stronger than they were on the nose. Somewhat thin mouthfeel. Mellow nicely, the strong alcohol on the nose does not make the palate, which is good.  FINISH: smooth, ever so slightly smoky, more cinnamon and spice, slightly peppery.  THOUGHTS: Nothing too complicated here, but a very nice pour. Enjoyable, am not going to kill myself to find the 7 year anywhere I can, interested in the 10 year and when they start distilling their own."
4.0,Sweet nose...maybe apricot and some vanilla quick spicy hot black pepper dry finish. Black pepper finish lingers. Nice one

4.0,"7 Year/Batch #153 / Bottled 2016/11/24
Nose - Initially you get a bit of a hot whiff, but with a bit of time you get classic notes of vanilla and brown sugar. This transitions to dark juicy cherries and what seems like strawberry shortcake or those individualy wrapped strawberry hard candies. I get an almost oily/buttery-like nose too.
Taste - Nose transitions into an oily sweet vanilla, cherries, and strawberries. There's this odd slightly raw ethanol note I get in this one though. It's like if you took dark cherries, strawberries, and sauteed it in butter and brown sugar with a vanilla pod, and then instead of using a quality rum or brandy to flambe, you used a bit of everclear.
Finish - Sweetness slowly fades to a young oakiness, vanilla and cherries linger and then again I get a bitterness like that of crushed cherry pits. Leaves a lightly drying, yet oily mouthfeel.

3.0,"Strong nose with honey and some citrus. Maybe a little vanilla as well. A sweeter aroma. Pleasant on the nose. 

Neat it hits the tip of the tongue and lingers on the sides as well. Warming. No burn going down. Flavor seems to fade faster than I would like. Solid taste but not extremely memorable.  Some of that sweetness hits the room of the mouth.

Flavor intensifies over ice. My preferred way to drink this particular bourbon."

2.0,"*Batch 117-Bottled by James on 3/12/15-Aged 7yrs* This had been on my ""to try"" list for a while and after I received an email from Smooth Ambler saying this and the 10 year were being discontinued due to procurement issues I decided to pick up one of the last two bottles my store had. This one is a light amber moving toward rust. Appropriate for 7 yrs and 99 proof. On the nose, give it a few minutes to open up for a touch of confectionary sweetness (think a custard filled donut) with a hefty dose of rye spice and faint oak. Similar to Wild Turkey. Oddly a splash of water brings a big dose of ethanol to the nose. Tried neat, this one starts off with a promising pink bubblegum sweetness, but that is quickly shoved out of the way by aggressive hot rye spice and bitter oak. Goes down with a short hot finish with tingling astringency left on the palate. A splash does tame the aggressiveness of this somewhat, but not nearly enough. Ice just makes it a muddled mess. Did not mix well either. I am usually a fan of high rye bourbons, but this one has no balance."

Nose- Maple syrup; rye spice; caramel; almonds, dried cherries 

Palate- Caramel; Rich vanilla; almonds; dried apricots; spicy oak

Finish- Medium/long, oily finish; Rye spices; Gingerbread; aged oak


Great pour. Not overly complex, but balanced and very tasty. The nose has great aromas of almonds and rye spices (traditional MGP notes). The palate isn’t anything crazy, but I get tons of vanilla, aged oak, and dried fruits. My favorite part of this is the gingerbread spice I get on the finish, just lovely."

Palate: earthy - rye influence is dominant.  I leather and a hint of plug tobacco.  A bit thin, but it works for this one.  Not great overall at this point. 

Finish: strangely, this bourbon finishes strong. Mix “hug” lingers for a but along with leathery, chocolate tones.  Makes me want a nice cigar.  

Overall, a little disappointed.  I had high hopes for this bourbon based on my research.  It didn’t live up to expectations, but still has a place on my bar.  Will pair very well with a nice fat cigar."
