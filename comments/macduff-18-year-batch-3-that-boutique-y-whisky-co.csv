4.0,"Another day another new distillery which started producing in 1963. A producer for blended single malts by Bacardi and now its juice goes into its subsidiary's blends offered by John Dewars & Son who also owns Royal Brackla, Aberfeldy, Craigalleiche, Aultmore. Well its another great Boutique W job. Great casking. Or cask given its only 372 500ml bottles. Couldn't find cask info (BtW is a bit average on this front). Tastes like first fill bourban but others have picked multi refill sherry but to me you get to much viscous honey and vanilla. Bit of herby vegativeness. The underlying spirit isn't brilliant, bit ethanolly but the casking sure compensates. Cheap for an 18 year at under $100. Solid 4 to 4.25 I reckon."
