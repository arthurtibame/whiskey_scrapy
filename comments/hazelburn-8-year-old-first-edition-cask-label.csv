4.25,"Ah Springbank I won't say you always come through as there have been a few oddities and over cooked items but man I love it when you do. Great body, perfect balance and complexity.. all the things I'd like to say about myself but hey I'd more than settle for a bottle of this to compensate. 

I had a newly opened bottle of the Glendronach 18 afterwards and though it was great (I'm thinking these days definitely more a 4.25 to 4.5 rather than higher. This is definitely on par and in some aspects exceeds. Sadly you can't get the first Edition anymore. I was going to take a punt on a later release at $100USD however the tasting notes seem a lot different to mine. Light and fruity vs a rich deeper oily sherry bourbon thing going on."
