4.0,"The spice is nice! This smells like a gorgeous fruitcake spiked with awesome booze.  No water needed here. The palate is a balance of every fruit you can imagine, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, and malt.  Man, the only thing I like about the A’bundah more than this 18 is the beautiful clove finish.  This one is medium and reminds me of a spicy buttery fluffy muffin. The theme is “Wonderful Christmastime” by Paul McCartney.  4.0"
4.0,"Cracked open this one and even without letting it breathe before taking my first sip I knew it was a good one. Sherry, spice and as the label says even apricot. It reminds me a bit of the Blanton's single barrel I had earlier with the sweetness and liquorice dialed down. I think to do justice to this one I need to let it open up and do a proper review but given its $90USD a bottle for an 18 year the least I can placehold this one at is a 4. Very interested to see if it goes up or down once it's been open for a bit. After a bit more time I'd say more a 3.5 as runs a bit hot for 43% and not really balanced. Was the least drunk whisky of the several I bought along on the night (the rest were great whiskies though to be fair). Rounding up for value the overall rating remains."

4.0,"I had the privilege to try this 18yo Aberlour again thanks to my Long Island connection, @Scott_E.  I initially had a bottle of this way back in 2016 and found it fantastic.  It’s a sherry bomb that has all the rounded edges you’d expect from a quality, well-aged 18 year old.  This is bottled at 43% and that’s about the perfect sweet spot IMO.

It’s amber and gold in the taster and makes lots of legs and droplets after giving it a swirl.  The nose is completely caramel/toffee and sherry sweetness.  There’s an underlying syrupy malty-ness that makes it dessert-like and savory from the start.  The palate is warm sherry, apples and pears, light vanilla and some robust oak tannins.  The finish is long and has a great lingering warmth.  It’s ultra smooth and leaves melted toffee notes hanging around well after the finish.  Excellent.

This is a solid 4, maybe 4.25 stars.  I enjoyed this one much more than the later batches of the A’bunadh and the much simpler, 12 year.  That 16 year offering is a money grab that should be totally avoided.  I recently bought 2 bottles of the new Casg Annamh- which means “rare cask” and will be reviewing those in the coming weeks.  Thanks again, Scott.  This was a treat.  Cheers."
4.0,"Another consecutive Wednesday and I find myself perfectly alone.  Let me kick it up with a gifted 18 year Aberlour while I finish season two of Westworld. 

A rich, but gentle sherried beginning, undoubtedly.  Orchard fruits aplenty, but complementary to the sherry.  Plumbs, oranges, peaches, apricots and apples.  A mild sweetness entwined amongst all the aromas of vanilla cream, salted caramel and cocoa. 

The whisky arrives with a spicy sweetness of vanilla and white pepper.  Orange, honey, cocoa sweetness comprise the core flavors on the palate.  There are small currents of brown sugar, almonds, caramel, raisins. 

The finish is long with orange bitters, oak tannins, charcoal and cinnamon. 

Unabashedly a sherried scotch, if anyone who is familiar with Aberlour. The opening nose draws you into the depths hoping to discover more.  The palate is the weakest segment of the whisky, being short and light with the flavors. Quite good overall and balanced well. This would make a good pairing with a mild cigar and time...and may have to try that sooner than later. [$120][90/100][Tasted: 7/18/18]"

4.0,"Down to the last half dozen bonus samples of the final round of the SDT and I am most excited about them. The beginning of the end comes in the form of this 18 year old single malt scotch from Aberlour. I’ve actually owned this bottle for nearly 2 years and never got around to opening it, so I’m glad that it was provided to me in sample form. Bottled at 43% ABV and is chill filtered with colorant added making it a dark amber color. 

The nose opens with soft sherry, soft but rich. Orange marmalade, raisins and vanilla. Black cherries, worn oak, distant tobacco notes and some maple. Watered down grape juice, cinnamon, cocoa powder and powdered ginger. A touch floral as well. Not as full as I had hoped, but it’s definitely mature. 

The nose belies a spicy palate. Baking spices, not so much a peppery spice, mostly in the nutmeg and ginger arena. Molasses, tobacco and dark sherry. Thick, almost burnt caramel, Worthers toffee. This is similar in style to the Blair Athol 12, but better in quality and maturity. 

A medium bodied mouthfeel that is lightly oily and mouthwatering. 
The finish is medium short, sherry, orange pith and tobacco. 

I tried. I tried really hard to love this one, but it just didn’t do it for me. Never let it be said that I have called Aberlour 18 a bad dram, because it’s far from that...it just didn’t wow me. The quality is there, it’s just missing something. Something is needed to push it from good to great. Perhaps a higher percentage of first fill sherry casks, higher ABV, something. As it sits, I’m going with a 3.75, but an argument could be made for a 4. Thanks to @Scott_E for the sample. 
Cheers"

Pallet: Sweet fruity ripe plum, honey, honey crisp apple, necturne, slight spice and oak, orange and rind bitterness. I can hold this in my mouth forever and it never reaches a level of spice that makes me want to swallow. Very well balanced, and deep with character.

Finish: Dark chocoate, slight oak char. This is not a complex finish, but one that is very enjoyable and lingers for a very long time.

Nose round 2: Dark chocolate is now in the foreground. Rich red fruits sitting just below it. Kind of like Brookhaven chocolates.

Not sure where Henzel got this bottle for $70, but I would buy every bottle they had. The 16 year goes for that price where I am. With that said, I would go out of my way to find this bottle if mine starts to run low. This is a fantastic bottle that I will be enjoying for many months in my rotation."

4.0,"A bonus offering from @Scott_E for our final trading round.   The only other Aberlour I’ve had was the Abundah.  I actually liked this one better—-less syrupy, a bit more balanced with flavors of fruit and vanilla.  Scott provided a generous enough sample where I was able to experiment 1/2 with a single cube of ice, the other neat with just a drop or two of water.  Neat is by far more preferred.  It retains the sweet fruit backbone, while with ice it brings out a lemon rind bitterness.  Skip the ice.  Thanks Scott for the pour!"

3.75,"Color: Reddish amber

Nose: Honey glazed red fruits on an oak slab sprinkled with cinnamon and vanilla bean. A slight undertone of milk chocolate. This is divine. 

Pallet: Light and oily, chocolate, oak spice, less fruity than I would expect, undertone of honey and cinnamon.

Finish: Long Oak, slight smoke/barrel char. Solid finish, but lacks in character.

The nose hold all the flavors, and some of those flavors disappear on the pallet, and then more disappear on the finish. This whisky does what it does well, but I would rather have the 16 year as it hits on more notes that I enjoy more. Mainly the fruity and chocolaty. This is still a solid whisky and would buy another bottle when mine runs out, but I would not go looking for it (it is not in local ABC stores) and could do with out."

4.25,"Nose: A foundation note of big, full, rich sherry. There's a marvellous aroma of citrus that is mid-way between orange and lemon zest. Apricot, vanilla, chamomile tea and chocolate fudge are noticeable and over time the aroma of oak begins to cut through. A fleeting floral tone flits about the sidelines. It's an impressively classy and enveloping nose. [The dry glass aroma is dark chocolate].

Palate: The arrival is like dark, bitter, chocolate-covered raisins dipped in orange and cherry liqueur. The development brings leathery and sweet tobacco notes together with dark (slightly sour) cherries, peaches, mixed peel, arrowroot biscuits, hard molasses toffee, dark fruit cake, stem ginger and mildly spicy tannins. There is a warm roundness to the lightly oily texture.

Finish: Medium/long. Espresso, raisins, dried figs, tobacco. A lingering aftertaste of cocoa powder.

This is an excellent whisky that evolves over time and continually shifts, revealing facets of its confident and assured complexity throughout the tasting. The nose holds the fruitier elements while the palate presents more earthy tastes, but the transition and flow of the whisky is what you notice most. There is a story and a journey here.

This whisky eloquently demonstrates authority without bombast and it's far too refined to be described as a sherry bomb. The official Distiller tasting notes are precise and perceptive.

The addition of water makes little difference to the profile but dilutes the experience. This is best taken neat, preferably accompanied by a platter of soft-ripened cheese  and walnuts.

The nose very sherry yet with a savory note as well. Really delicious and rich and deep and intense. Dried apricots and citrus. Natural orange lemonade. Some interesting spice notes as well (fresh black pepper, anise, cloves). Simply amazing and not overly sweet. 

Pepper and oaky wood right of the bat. Then some deep spiced dried fruits, some nuts and whole grain cereals. A slight burn. Very mature tannins and an amazing cask style. So unique. Later sour red fruit juice. 

This is a serious whisky. Very strong and intense. And very delicious and complex. Strongly recommended. One of the best sherry whiskys you can get in my opinion if you want a strong and not overly sweet one."

The nose is muted, which is surprising.  No alcohol, and just the faintest hint of Sherry.  Fruit is one of the better noses, it's just really hard to pick it up.  Disappointing.

On the pallate, the smoothness continues.  No alcohol bite, just sweet Sherry goodness.  However, where the A'Bunadh is turned up to ""11"", this is at. ""6"".  More refined, for sure.  But this should really be 46-48% ABV.  This most certainly is not ""big"", in fact it is one of the more subtle Sherried whiskys around.  More subtle than the Highland Park 18, even.  From what is available, white peaches, plums, overripe apricot, Mandarin oranges, salted caramel latte, and Fiji apple custard. The oak starts to build toward the back of the pallate.

The finish is ever so slightly spicy, and a little bitter, like 95% cacoa-covered pepper, with a dash of Washington cherry, and the oak really starts to come through a little stronger.

This is unmistakably Aberlour.  Heavily sherried, similar to the A'Bunadh, just more polished, with more oak, but less.....well, less of everything else.  I don't mind dropping $$$$ on aged whisky, but I think the A'Bunadh is better, price be damned.  The glenfarclas I had in a head-to-head had far more character, and of everything, really.  Furthermore it did it with the same ABV.  It's only downside was the alcohol burn, and it was slightly less complex.  There are much better options for the money than the Aberlour 18.  Not bad, just not near what it's cracked up to be, especially at the price."
