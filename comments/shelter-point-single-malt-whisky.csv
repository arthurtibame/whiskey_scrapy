4.0,"Subtle but complex at the same time. The flavours don’t erupt into your mouth, they are like a “Where’s Waldo” adventure where the more you look the more you find. Very nice for such a young whisky. Stashed a case in my basement to see how it ages."

3.5,"Chocolate and vanilla on the nose. 
On the palate you find that initial sweet note at the front. It shows a salty side as the whisky moves through the mouth, and finishes with a bitter citrus note. All in all an interesting dram"
4.0,Light and friendly - a great introduction to single malts (and made right here in BC!). I remember this tasting remarkably similar to my Ardbeg 10 without the peat.
4.0,"Very smooth
No peat"
4.5,"Smells of baked goods, pear and apple. Honey as well. Tastes of pear and apple followed by a spicy sweetness. Smoky and oily flavour on the finish."

4.0,"In my glass: golden yellow
In my nose:  sea breeze, coconut and pineapple.  Wisps of ribbon candy, vanilla nicely supported by malt, citrus, cocoa and warm toffee.
On my tongue:  baking spices, fruits, vanilla and cocoa."
