4.25,"Expensive, flavorful like the Valknut, but not as smooth or as peaty as the 12 and 18. The 12 and 18 are far superior, but I enjoy this one a lot. The price is high because it's from a single cask. Money would be better spent on the 18 year or the Valknut (similar taste, similar bite, but a lot more affordable.)"

I had a small sample of this at a large chain wine store, and immediately fell in love with it.  This is a 13 yr single sherry cask Highland Park...something you don’t see often.  At $200, yes, expensive...but it’s NCF, single cask, sherry HP with an age statement.  But, more importantly, it’s the taste of this that wowed me.  Aroma of black cherries and sweet icing.  On palette, very lightly smoked, with floral taste...raspberries, some salt.  Really well made.  I ended up getting a bottle..."
