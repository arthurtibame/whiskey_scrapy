4.0,"Master Distiller – Brian Nation. Bottle serial number 18445

The 2015 Midleton Very Range provides a lot more pot still character and also more spicy, oaky notes that previous versions. The bottle carries the signature of new-ish Master Distiller Brian Nation.

Nose - Lively, fruity and ester filled aromas. 
Taste - Powerful and richly flavoured with perhaps a higher pot still content than before. Sweet, orange citrus and pineapple quickly become quite peppery and spicy with flavours of cloves, ginger, cinnamon, vanilla.
Finish - Great length with the complex flavours continuing to evolve all the way to the finish.
