It has a very golden color, no reddish sherried colour whatsoever. 

On the nose it is very fruity, but fails to be interesting. First sniff is full of acetone, to then reveal yellow apples, pineapple, cheap lemon air freshener, apple juice, NO SHERRY AT ALL.

On the palate, it is lame. The first note i got was an old stored box, like old cardboard with straws inside. A very dim apple note, and water. Way too watery. 

Aftertaste is nothing. Ginger and water. A complete dissapointment. 

Overall this is a very forgettable dram. Nose helps it a little bit but not enough to even reach a 2.5 score. 

48 over a 100, avoid it."

If you like those peach and vanilla gummy chews, you can find a hint of that in the nose, too. The palate is appealingly fruity with plenty of white peach, crunchy cereal (Grape Nuts?), and surprisingly little sherry influence. Enjoyable, if not spectacular."
