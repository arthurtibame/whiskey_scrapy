4.0,"Nose: Grain silo. Hay. A hint of burnt oak. Minerally, like hot sand blowing around a beach. A hint of butter and canteloupe. After a few drops of water vanilla and spiced scones come through that were previously hiding.

Palate: Oak, raw grain, and cream. Again, a bit of sweetness, spice, and vanilla but only after adding some water. Very soft and pleasant, almost effervescent. 

Finish: Slow build, medium length. More oak and vanilla and cream, with some black pepper. Slightly minerally/metallic"
4.5,"Fruits and spices. Nose: extra fruity. Tropical fruits, mango, citrus, vanilla. No big   spicyness. Some alcohol. Palate: creamy, vanilla, tropical fruits. Then spice comes to be dominant. Finish: dry, sweet, ginger spiceyness. 46% like all Teeling stuff."
