Tastes just like the 12yr for $15 more in price. Totally not worth the money."

4.0,"Tried at Miami Whiskey Mash 2018, alongside its 12-year old younger brother.  The greatest thing about the 15-year rendition of this single malt is that it's stunningly affordable at around $40, which makes it the least expensive 15-year old scotch on the market.  The generically sweet and fruity profile of the 12-year old improves here, and I got a nice, crisp apple flavor that combined well with the slightly drier malt.  This one may become my house single malt, as I think it's one that could be enjoyed by the broadest variety of palates."

2.0,"Unimpressive, yet drinkable. It’s not that it’s a bad scotch, it’s just too flat across the flavor profile; like it is trying to be the “everything” scotch. I’m finding it better mixing it with a splash of Glenmorangie, Macallan, or even monkey shoulder greatly improves the taste profile. I probably wouldn’t buy it again."

3.25,"A little light on the nose and the palate, but for me, it has a long lasting bite on the backend.  It reminds me a little of an Irish whiskey.  I got it on sale for under $35, so I figure why not.  $35 for a 15 years Scotch.  I would have scored it higher if it had a little more flavor."
