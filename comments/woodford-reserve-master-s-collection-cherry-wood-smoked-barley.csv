3.0,"Surprisingly I get banana bread on the nose. Not a hint. It's strong and obvious to me. Plus some sap. On the palate, obvious creamy malt notes. It's sweet at first, a bit one notey. The malt quickly follows, some earth notes, a hint of nuts, some dark fruit. Strong dark chocolate, I seem to get that with Woodford offerings. The banana bread is there in the aftertaste. Interestingly, I'm searching hard for the smoke flavor and just not getting much of it. But this stands on its own without it. It's definitely interesting, worth trying. 11/9/17"

4.0,Chris hits it out of the park with this one. I haven't found one liked more that the Four Wood- till this one. Add a little water to unlock the cherries

3.0,"$99

Neat: definitely cherries on the nose and very sweet. Pretty smooth and again cherries on the taste buds but not a super long finish.

Splash: opens up the nose and taste even further. Basically you're going to smell and taste cherry starbursts for days and the finish is much longer and more intense.

Good bourbon, wouldn't buy a bottle though unless you're a Woodford fan and like collecting."

3.0,"Almost overpowering banana bread notes on the nose, which follows through on the palate. I don’t get any cherry on the nose or palate...just because the barley was smoked in cherry wood doesn’t mean you should expect to get any cherry notes on the nose or in the taste of this bourbon. The large percentage of barley in the mashbill clearly comes through with a scotch/bourbon blend-like flavor. However, I still don’t really get any of the smoke that I expected. I guess it’s very subtle. This is a very unique bourbon due to the high barley mashbill. It’s not horrible, but I definitely expected more for the price."

4.0,Woody but not aggressive.  Sweet with a subtle winter spice.  Really enjoyed this when sampled at Liquor Barn with a dash of water.
3.75,"Wow. Cherry on the nose and the palate, caramel, oak, spice. Nice but quite sweet..couldn't drink to much of this and wouldn't buy a bottle. 3.75 I'll give it but I suspect over time the rating would drop a bit if I had an open bottle."
2.0,"While not disgusting and offensive, like other Master's Collection releases such as Classic Malt and Aged Cask Rye, this still underwhelms .

Nose is faint BBQ with a lot of ethanol. Palate is toasted corn with a malty base.  Not a cherry bomb. A little heat. It's palatable but not memorable and certainly not worth the asking price."
4.0,"33 open bottles in my collection ranked through multiple blind tastings.  Counting them down!
  
  #16: Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection Cherry Wood Smoked Barley.  Kentucky Straight Bourbon.  45.2% ABV.  NAS.
  Paid $104
  It’s a pretty unique experience, but not worth ~$100 for a re-experience.
  
  Cherry wood smoked barley is a perfect description for this odd bourbon.  Cherry and wood are prominent on the nose.  Cherry cola, artificial sweetener, some blackberries.  The wood is a dank, sweaty, decaying variety.  It’s not obvious that is a bourbon.  On the palate, this is halfway to Redbreast.  Biscuits, brown sugar, malt, and of course cherry.  Smokiness on the finish.  This mashbill includes 30% malted barley that has been exposed to cherry wood smoke in the drying process.  This creates a truly unique dram that may have you guessing if it is a bourbon, Irish, or Scotch when tasting blind.  Very interesting initially, but once you get accustomed, the heavy-handed cherry and wood notes start to prevent you from repeatedly reaching for the bottle, which is in that awkward area of being too expensive to just drink for no good reason, but is not good enough to enjoy for a special occasion.  A 375mL bottle for half the price would have been perfect.

1.0,"Nose of flat, stale, vanilla-cherry Coca-Cola. Taste is slightly spicy throughout and the finish shows the smoked barley"
3.75,Really unique. Sweet and woody. Has a hefty amount of scotch notes due to the higher % of barley in the mash. Actually quite complex and gets better as it sits. 3.8.

3.0,"Dry, chalky nose that gives way to a sort of burnt gijoe profile. Backbone is solid spice with mild toasted marshmallow. Not my favorite, though I’m a fan of both woodford reserve and high barley mash bills. The Woman next to me puked while I wrote this. I just wanna sip good whisky. Call an Uber folks."
1.0,"Terrible, worst bourbon I’ve ever bought/tried."
4.0,"Gets better as it ages in the bottle IMO. 
Wasn’t getting much when I first opened it, but a year in & the cherry definitely comes through a lot stronger, both on the nose & palate.  Smoke was always there, but cherries were lacking.  
Best neat, just a drop of water lightens everything."

4.0,"Blind tasting, I definitely identified Woodford’s smooth flavor. Little funk at the end makes for a quandary on flavor. Need to taste again in a different blind lineup. Overall, good, but a little disappointed when I was aware of the cost. Not sure it is worthy of the price."

3.0,"With a cost at approximately $100 USD here in New Hampshire, you would be better off with Woodford Reserve's Double Oaked or a bottle of Blanton's Original Single Barrel for approximately half of the cost. 

With that said, this is by no means a terrible bourbon. It's easy to drink neat with no chaser. The smoke flavor is noticeable, but not overpowering. There is just very little that stands out and even less to celebrate with this mediocre spirit for the cost."

4.5,"Wow, one one of the most complex and best pours I’ve had.  The cherry wood is up front, subtle but noticeable. It gives a sweetness that rounds out the taste and mellows the heat. The follow up is the smoke. A strong but not over powering char. I loved this, just too bad for the price. This was a one time deal. I’ve never managed to find a bottle for sale, but the silver lining is that means I have not had to face the hard choice or whether or not to buy at over $100 per bottle."
