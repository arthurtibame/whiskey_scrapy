3.75,"I tried this from a mini-bottle (like the ones you get on an airplane) and it was much better than I thought it'd be (I'll admit I went in expecting it to be inferior to other classic American whiskies in the same way gluten free beer tastes a bit off).  In fact, it was smooth and a touch sweet, with notes of butterscotch and a nutty-sappy-waxy quality, like the skin of pecans or walnuts.  I enjoyed it neat and I was really pleasantly surprised.

It tastes enough like bourbon that if I had had this without knowing what it was, I wouldn't have suspected anything unusual about the ingredients."
