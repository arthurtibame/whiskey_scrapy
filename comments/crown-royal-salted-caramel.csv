4.0,"Tastes just as it sounds but you better like caramel. Strong caramel flavor without a whole lot of a traditional whiskey flavors. It can be hard to find but as a seasonal option or a dessert treat, I will be looking for it again!"
1.0,Not what I expected. I was hoping for a actual taste of caramel. Not worth the money at all. 29$

3.0,Tastes like what it says. Warning....you better like sweet. It’s a caramel overload. Really rich and a smooth supper. Would be best mixed with coffee or other drink.

2.0,Too sweet
3.5,"strong caramel (almost like a schnapps) with a little whiskey on the nose.  the same is true for the taste; smooth, sugary (not as strong as schnapps) with a subtle whiskey finish.  CR really does make some of the best flavored whiskeys on the market.  would definitely rate lower if comparing to a something non-flavored, but for flavored not too bad"

5.0,Not a flavored bourbon guy but this is an absolute must buy. Great for a seasonal treat. It's hard to find so I recommend picking up as many as you can when you see it on the shelf.
4.0,Like a liquid Kraft caramel while sniffing cotton candy.  Certainly something to make into a dessert substitute. Had to buy to fill out my CR velvet bag collection.
4.0,"Perfect for Carmel Apple shots and mixing with bourbon cream! It has great flavor and worth picking up multiples if you have gatherings as it is a limited offering. As a scotch and bourbon fan, this is the only flavored liquor I would swear by."
5.0,tastes like butterscotch but not syrupy. very smooth and easy to drink
3.0,"Although I love salted caramel desserts, this one just seemed too sweet for me.  Starts off with a rich caramel taste on the lips and softens to a sugary butterscotch finish. An excellent drink to have after dinner if you're looking for something to have with or after dessert.  Cigar pairing: San Cristobal de La Habana La Fuerza, Vegas Robaina Unicos or Trinidad Especiales."

2.0,"This very sweet, good for mixers but not to brink straight. If you are person hunting for notes, you will not be able to find them with the Carmel flavoring."
