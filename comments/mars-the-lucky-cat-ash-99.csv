4.0,"A gentle soft sweetness is the first sensation on the palate, like so much good Japanese whisky, the subtlety is what makes it intriguing. There is a lot of solid spice, cedar on the palate, with a soft aftertaste that reminds me of agave syrup, without being cloying. Definitely a special whisky for after dinner."
