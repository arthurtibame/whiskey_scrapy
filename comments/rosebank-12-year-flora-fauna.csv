4.0,"Arguably the most famous expression of the Flora & Fauna range, Rosebank 12 has become a rare find. Fresh, delicate and complex, the aroma enchants with yellow fruits, blossom honey and subtle hints of chamomile. Red currants, kiwi and corn flakes emerge. Creamy, floral and slightly astringent at first, the taste is shifting towards barley sugar, honeydew melon and sour tangerines. Mint leaves, wood spices and a touch of white wine accompany the crisp and elegant finish. Time will tell if the 'new' Rosebank can live up to the quality of this iconic malt.

4.5,"Nose - Gentle nose, floral honey, baked apples, hint of fresh hay, lemon zest

Taste - Light floral honey, lemon peel with pith, cooked apples/pears, light bitter apple peel + core/stem, refreshing sweet peppermint-like feeling

Finish - Bright fruity ""heat"" lingers, lingering fruity/floral watered down honey, cooling ""mint"" feeling, hint of lemon/pomelo rind

Score - 86/100

Final Thoughts - For a 12 year old Scotch, this has quite a lot of character for such a light colored spirit too. I'd attribute this to the distillate itself with a gentle cask influence as the color was actually quite light in color. Everything about this is nicely balanced, there aren't really any off-putting notes in this and it's quite tasty and is really a great spring/summer dram as it's really light & oddly refreshing on the palate. Not the most complex dram, but there's just something in the mouthfeel that I just can't seem to describe that is quite unique.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe?

Would I buy a bottle? - Not at current prices, but if I could somehow magically find this for"
