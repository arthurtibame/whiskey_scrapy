5.0,"One of my favorite bourbons. The extra toasting helps balance the sweetness of the regular Michters and gives it a smokey toasty flavor and more body. I never thought about the beer flavor connection, will have to have a taste and check that out."

4.0,I've really been enjoying this bourbon. Michter's has been putting out some great products. I get just a touch of smoke from the finishing process of using the toasted barrel. A great pour.

4.0,"Wow, tons of bananas from the moment I poured it. Good bourbon, not too sweet and full of flavor, but you better like banana"
4.0,"This is intense for a bourbon, not as sweet as one would expect but the flavors are there. Tons of toasty vanilla and raisins on the finish. I like it."

4.0,I haven't been a huge fan of the Michter's bourbon because it is aggressively sweet.  The smokiness of the toasted barrel tempers the sweetness beautifully.  I'm pissed I didn't buy myself a bottle when I had the chance.

4.0,Anything  toasted has my undivided attention including bread. I was rooting for this to supersede the Unblended Michter but it didn't. It was a strong #2 and would drink it again and again

3.75,"Not quite as good as I was hoping but good nonetheless. Vanilla, oak, smoke and char are upfront. There is an interesting brine salt quality that none of the reviews I read mentioned that is paired with leather as a finish. Nice unique complexity.

Finish is hot, great burn that lingers. The perfect pain."

3.5,Nose is smokey and sweet. I lose the smokiness on the palate. Sweet and fruity with a short finish. Lots of cinnamon.
4.5,Tastes very close to the rye. Very smooth
4.25,Solid
4.0,smooth and warm at the end

3.0,"This was part of a three tasting flight - and second of this triple flight.  As you start to taste it, you get a hint of orange, apple, and a hint of toasted wood. This is a smooth start but a sharp finish. It's a bourbon that would pair well with a beer or two."
