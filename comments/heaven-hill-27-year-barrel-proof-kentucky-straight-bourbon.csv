null,"This was excellent- definitely well balanced and not over oaked for the age - the nose was bright, inviting and fruity- the palate Didn’t exactly match the nose but hit me just right- not too sweet and not too spicy, somewhat viscous with a great spice. The finish was clean quick and magical without any tannins or funk. I’m not a big fan of HH, but this was the best bourbon i’v had in a while. 👍🏼"

Tasting it at Old Talbott with CSM was amazing capstone to Spirits & Spirit day on the Trail. The bar had only gotten it less than a week ago. Probably won’t ever see it again. Amazing story with the ‘96 fire. Complex, perfume, but to be honest might be slightly over-Oaked."
4.0,Great nose. Nothing offensive. Taste is even keeled. Balanced spice. Not over oaked.

5.0,Nostalgia. Earthy nose. Reminds me of a country club locker room. Initial taste is light pine and opens up a lot on the tongue without getting too loud. After taste lingers and burns a bit more.  Would pair nicely with spiced chicken or a joint.

4.0,Delicious with a little spice.  It’s similar to rip 12 in smoothness but dang the finish is really short for a 27 year.  Surprisingly very little oak in the palatte.  Glad i tried vut not worth the $300 msrp

4.5,"Amazing nose, so vibrant, lots of caramelized oak sweetness and spice, nothing over powers. Reminiscent of a Dusty, taste is everything you get from the nose, classic Dusty HH taste with complexity and richness"

4.25,"Nose- Oak, earthy, you can definitely tell there’s age

Palate- Sweet, light honey, plenty of oak, small bit of ash

Finish- Very smooth as expected, oak trail, not a harsh finish at all

Surprisingly lots of flavors for a 27 year, if you get the opportunity don’t pass it up"

5.0,"Extremely complex. Strong oak throughout, initial fruit notes gave way to sweet vanilla and caramel notes with a spicy finish"

3.75,"Nose: Green apple
Palate: Spicy, cigar"
3.25,"The quality of this bourbon does not meet the price it demands.

Easy drinking.
Nose is pleasant. Smells like a rackhouse.
Palate is pretty damn oaky. Little bit of sweetness. Not a lot other than the light sweetness for taste. It isn't over oaked as many other old bourbons are, but it is extremely 1 dimensional.

If you haven't had prefire heaven hill give this a shot."
