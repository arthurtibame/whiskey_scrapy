4.0,"A younger sibling from the Wemyss malt ""The Hive 12yo"" which actually breaks the myth that ""older is always better"" since this expression is, for me, more rounded than the 12yo one. 

Bottled at 46%abv

On the nose, it is not good but not bad either. Acetone, vanilla, honey, dry cake, caramel, dulce de leche, sawdust, almonds and hazelnut. 

On the palate it is a fairly good dram. Pineapple, tropical fruits and very refined honey, the most lovely honey note ever. Very similar to pancakes.

Aftertaste, is also nice, maybe too standard. Tobacco, ginger. Medium finish. 

Overall this is a straightforward dram, but not a bad whisky at all. 84 over 100. For the price, it is good."
