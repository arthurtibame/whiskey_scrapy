4.0,"My share of this bottle is in a decanter that last held Hazelburn 12. Its color is to die for. The initial nosing reveals black cherry, blood orange, and grape must. Underlying these rich fruit flavors the aromas are reminiscent of an old forest. Peat explodes across the palate, adding to the aroma a medicinal quality. It’s rich and sweet, and very peaty. Sweet pepper jam and honey and raspberries also come to mind. The peat and the wine, rather than being melded together, play independent and strong roles. The pinot noir influence is ultimately the louder of the two. The boreal finish is astringent with wine tannins and barrel spice, giving way to the rich fruit notes from the nose and palate. This one is for enjoying on a chilly night in front of a bonfire. Maybe the only whisky out of Springbank Distillery that I haven’t loved – but I do like it very much."
