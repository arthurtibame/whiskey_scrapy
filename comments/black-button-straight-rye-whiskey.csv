3.0,"A tasty young rye with a slightly sweet finish. A good gateway for people new to the spirit, as evidenced by the warm reception it was getting from curious vegetable shoppers stopping at the New York Rye Week stall at Union Square Greenmarket today. (That’s curious people, not people shopping for curious vegetables, though there’s no shortage of them at this market.)"
