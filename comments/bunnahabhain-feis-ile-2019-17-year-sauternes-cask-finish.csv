3.25,"Returning to my stash of Bunna samples, this is one of two I have from 2019’s Feis Ile festival releases. It’s an unpeated Bunnahabhain that was matured first in ex-bourbon casks for 12 years and then in Sauternes wine hogsheads for five. This resulted in 1,118 bottles at an ABV of 54.2%, priced originally at 195 pounds. 

There’s a noticeable orange tinge to the liquid, a color I don’t recall seeing previously in a whisky. The nose is a little tight but with time and a dash of water gives up some sweet fruity notes in the canned fruit spectrum. It’s a similar story on the palate: juicy stone fruits, sweet but not cloyingly so. There’s a hint of something pleasantly funky on the finish, but it’s elusive. And that’s about it. It’s nice but not particularly interesting and I kept wishing for some smoke to dial up the complexity. I know that’s a combination that works because I have two delicious Springbank Society bottles that were matured in Sauternes for nine years. Let’s hope Bunnahabhain releases a Moine version one day. In the meantime, this is worth a try if you get the chance, but I wouldn’t chase a bottle, even at its original retail price."
4.5,"Unpeated. Smooth sweet nose and honeyed palate.
