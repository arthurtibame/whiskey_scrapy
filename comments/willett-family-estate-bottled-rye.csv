3.75,"Nose: wet earth and acetone sweetness.

Taste: creamy, some spice but not too much. Smooth and doesn’t bite back.  Thankfully I don’t get the pickle flavors but rather dark chocolate and slight hint of mint. What keeps messing with my head is the nail polish remover fumes up my sinus."

4.25,"Second time reviewing this one

Nose - floral and spices. It’s complex but cannot quite grasp everything going on.

Taste - full and rich immediately. As it rolls on the tongue I get some floral notes and spices. The finish is nice and long with light to medium heat with baking spices and more floral notes. Quite smooth for the proof.

Overall and value - this is an excellent rye. Very drinkable and smooth considering the proof and only 4 years. Quite good but comes with a 50-60+ price tag and sometimes more. Very good nonetheless and a must have for anyone wanting a great rye."

4.75,"Tried with a great friend. His first time trying it as well. I was very excited when I found this bottle.
Very sweet and well rounded. Normally while nosing something this high ABV I have to give it some distance but this doesn’t smell or taste like a Cask strength whiskey. It’s complex and wonderful with a little spicy edge but not harsh or painful. Fruit and Vanilla before the spice. This was by far my best experience with Rye and I’m looking forward to the rest of the bottle."

4.5,"114.4 proof 2018 release.

A beautiful deep orange color.  The legs hide at first, but once they form they slowly grow thick and oily down the sides of the glass.  An attractive whiskey.

An uncharacteristically rich, creamy, tropical fruit nose.  Cherry vanilla cream soda with some un-identifiable exotic spices.

A full-fledged fruity assault on the palate.  So rich and flavorful.  Carries some characteristic pepper and mint rye notes, but those are just the sidebar to the intense flavors.  Wow.  Rosewater.  White grape.  Valencia orange rind.  Cocoa.  Sweet, sweet toasted marshmallow.  Juicy Fruit gum overlaid with white peppercorn.  Some semblance to a bold brandy or grappa, but so much more spice and character.  A creamy, oily mouthfeel.  Dazzling pepper on the tongue for a finish with a little tingle in the cheeks and back of the throat.  Lasting.

Final thoughts = whoa.  Buckle up your seatbelts.  I think I love it but I need to revisit just to catch my breath.  Truly extraordinary - I’ve never had another rye anything like this..."

4.75,"The first thing to say about this bottle: I am in love. While I have been turning more and more to rye whiskey lately as my obsession of choice, the Willett 4-Year Barrel Proof Rye is the missing link between a proper bourbon and a perfect rye. Of course, every palate has its own preferences.

Immediately apparent in this rye, both in the nose and taste, is the artful balance of sweet and spice, honey and heat... it’s a tug of war on the tongue that swings to sweet, but pulls back to bite in the finish.

Nose: The sweetness hits early with dark fruit and vanilla, then quickly turns to spice, clove and cinnamon at the forefront. All these aromatics blend ever more beautifully the longer you let it sit. And while you wait, just gaze into that glowing golden goodness just beckoning you to give in and drink it already.

Taste: What the nose hints, the taste hits. There’s that wave of cinnamon and clove, enveloped in vanilla, and filled out with faint traces of wood grain, not nutty or toasted, but more earthy, almost like a fresh mint. What lingers on the finish is that same spice that welcomed you in your initial waft.

Overall, I would say I have just found my new favorite dram. Wish I had bought two."

Minty, cedar, woodsy, tobacco.  A little heat cinnamon, but again the wood comes in and I love it, not overpowering but perfectly placed.  The finish is short for me. I wish the finish was more complex and longer, as a result, I find myself quickly re-lifting the glass to revisit and endulge in that amazing taste over and over again.  This is so delicious to drink. I'm glad I found it, and for $50.  I only see it in stock at the higher end stores. I'll probably run out and buy another!"

2.25,"Note: this is only the 3 year review. 

initially not a fan of this bottle but once it sat open for a little while it really developed into a strong pour. 

Nose: rye spices, cinnamon, nutmeg, anise, maybe some cardamom?
Palate: Cinnamon really comes through. this is like apple pie spices and cinnamon nonstop. as that degrades, you get some mint, herbal essences, a touch of ethanol. 
Finish: mint comes through once again and a touch of the spiciness of the rye makes an appearance; but it’s not overbearing. i believe this is a low rye-content rye; perhaps 51% or 65% rye, doubtful it’s more than that."

The flavor profile starts off nice and sweet, some caramel, toffee, grains and a little banana. It morphs into this intense rye driven beast that tingles your tongue as you roll it. It finishes with.... and I had to think hard but it hit me like a barrel... pickle brine!

Nice and viscous, it sticks around."

4.25,"Tasting:  Neat in glen cairn and then with 3 drops of water.  Proofed at 109.4.

Nose: (4.0)  Chocolatey and rich.  Spicier with some ethanol, and cereal.  The nose tells you this dram is no fooling.  Whiff harder and there is some butterscotch notes in the background

Palate (4.5):  A bit spicy at first, a bit of water really opens up some great flavors.  Chocolate and cereal are dominant, but then I get some orange marmalade and ginger snap cookie with that.  The mouthfeel is very coating and oily.  This is an incredibly rich rye.

Finish (4.25):  The palate follows through to a nice long finish.  Some oak pops towards the end and really stays with you.  The spiciness turns sweeter and a bit of smoke pops  Really enjoyable.

Overall:  This is super good.  I can't believe this is only a four year old!  It is rich and tasty, finishes long and allows you to really taste the barrel.  I did not get the brine others spoke of, but I did get the spucy sweet notes.  I paid 54.00 for this bottle and got a secind right sway."

The palate is dry and initially fills the mouth with oak, with tropical fruit coming in a wave behind it, giving way to chocolate and rye, and brine, with caramel coming in at the end as it breathes. The finish is medium long with fading rye spiciness, tropical fruit, caramel and oak."

4.75,"Okay, I’m either becoming a rye fan, or I’ve been on a streak of atypically good ryes. This one is right up there.

I can tell that I have some room to grow on what I can detect on ryes. Particularly the nose. This one holds brown sugar and fresh cut flowers.

Body is sweeter than I was expecting, and I taste lime juice and more sugar.

Finish has a very acidic mouth feel, currently not something I’m into on a day-to-day basis, but I get how people (and perhaps me one day) could be into it. There’s a bit of leather and dark chocolate in the finish.

Overall, this is not one iota overrated. It deserves its acclaim, and that’s coming from someone who still wouldn’t self-identify as a rye fan. I got brand new things in this rye that I’d never tasted before in a whiskey. Very happy to have these bottles on my shelf."

2.5,"Revised: When I first opened this bottle, I was smacked in the face with ethanol, acetone, eucalyptus, mint, a whiff of honey and light malty notes. A very harsh medicinal nose. The palate was similarly harsh, reminding me of the old, original flavor of Listerine. Very heavily herbaceous, with notes of black pepper, and menthol. 

After a couple of months, the whiskey has opened up quite a bit, with the solvent notes fading a bit to be replaced by stronger notes of freshly cut grass, alfalfa, mint tea, eucalyptus, vanilla, and corn syrup. I don’t love this whiskey, but it is a nice example of a well crafted rye erring more towards the side of grassy, herbal flavors. 

This is a 102.2 proof version of this expression, purchased in Missoula MT."

A hint of rye on the nose, spicy, wood.

3.25,"I will confess I am not the biggest Willett fan. I really didn't care for the Cinnamon Red Hot dominant 2 and 3 yr version of this bottle. I liked the 80 the anniversary for it SRP as a nice young expression. So I have been super hesitant to pay any money for this one (despite the overwhelming positive reviews). I got a pour a couple months back and didn't care for it. Today was the day I decided to try again and finally review it. For $8/pour I wasn't complaining. Let me set the scene, it's about 108 degrees and I am sitting on the patio of my favorite cigar bar since I don't want to deal with all the cigar smoke indoors (side note it was recently recognised in the Whiskey Advocate as one of the best Whiskey drinker's cigar bars in America). There are misters going and some shade but it is just hot. TV is showing the Open with Tiger and Rory struggling. So of course I decide to go for a cask strength dram! Haha. A tall pint of heavily iced water as a companion I dive in:
On the palette it's surprisingly easy to drink and does still have a dominant cinnamon notes but it's a bit more restrained. Caramel, honey and some butterscotch comes thru leading into a mid palette that features more cinnamon and some clove. The finish is medium length with toffee and more spice. 
Mouthfeel is a little thin for a cask strength dram. All in all this is the best Willett Rye I have had and it does seem to improve each year. 
Now would I go.out and buy a bottle for between $55-$65, in short no. For that price point there are many Ryes I'd drink over this. 
Cheers all and Happy Thirsty Thursday!"

Lots of spices and herbs. Almost like musty vegetation/earth. A tiny bit of sharpness, not too sweet. 

Taste: 
Not much to it if swallowed quickly. Some spiciness at the end. Allowing it to linger at the front of the taste buds gives a minty spice, and the back, an overwhelming dill/earthy taste.

4.25,"Nose: The initial nosing brings out lots of green grass, rye spice, and a sort of licorice sweetness.  Lots of dill, cilantro, and maybe even fennel - this is full of herbs.  It almost reminds me of caraway, which makes me hesitant - I hate caraway...

Palate:  Cooling and not too sweet at first.  No alcohol burn and only a slight tingle mid-tongue.  Immediate burst of mint, licorice, and fennel before some grain forward notes that I'd almost call ""malty"" if this were a malt whiskey - interesting.  This reminds me of a Spruce-tip Shortbread Cookie I had the other day.

Finish:  Short-Medium and slightly dry.  The herbs die out pretty quickly, leaving walnut and char with some lingering oak.

Water dulls the overpowering herbs a bit, bringing out a buttery almond sort of scent.  There's also the unmistakable scent of DEET bugspray put on while out in the forest.  It feels much oilier and sweeter now with less licorice and caraway (thank god...) and more of a vegetal green note with some mint.  Buttery on the taste now and lasts longer, though that nice char and oak is gone from the finish.

Conclusion:  To be honest, this is one of the last bottles I'd grab on a normal night, I just can't do the dominating notes of licorice and caraway.  I couldn't have more than a very small pour of this every once in a while.  That being said, I think this is one of the most interesting and well-crafted whiskies I've ever had.  It is more complex than anything 4x it's age and changes with ever sip.  There's layer after layer of herb and spice that you could pick through for hours.  I have some serious respect for this one, it's just not the flavors I'd pick.  For that, I'm scoring it not on how much I like it, but instead on what it deserves as such a unique whiskey."

4.25,"Nose: bread-y, dough-y and full of honey, lemongrass, mint and a hint of caramel

Palate: spicy mint, more honey and light fruits, even a hint of sweet tea

Finish: medium. And the 100+ proof is barely evident. It’s very smooth and refined. There’s even a little vanilla and cinnamon hanging around. 

I’m a casual rye drinker. Generally ryes to me aren’t that complex and other than the spices it just doesn’t speak to my tastes. This, however, is amazing. It’s the best rye I’ve ever had for sure and one of the best whiskeys I’ve tasted. The high rating is well deserved. And at only four years it’s a steal because it tastes like and older whiskey—if you can find it at MSRP."

It is not overly complex but provides something akin to a numbing effect from the spice and ethanol which are very well balanced."
4.5,"Wow, this is definitely a Willett.

The nose has that hallmark Willett spice to it. It has cinnamon, freshly baked bread and of course rye spice. 

The palate has an explosion of flavor. Mainly rye, but I also get cola, and some anise.

This is definitely the loudest and most unique ryes I’ve had. Very good."

Finish: medium to long but with very little bite. Oak, honey and mint linger.

2.5,"113.5 proof. Neat pour from fresh bottle. Stale popcorn and red hots, spicy.  Mint, cinnamon and a hint of menthol cherry on the finish. I was way more excited to find this bottle before I tried it, now it will go into Manhattans over the holidays. I have absolutely no idea how this bottle is expertly rated a 96"
4.5,"Powerful aroma consisting of cinnamon, french toast, orange, dill, leather, and musty old books. If that sounds like a strange combo, it sure is but it's also delightful. Amazingly low alcohol presence on the nose. I could sit here and sniff this all day. 

Palate: some chocolate not present in the nose, cinnamon toast crunch cereal, mandarin orange, and a hint of pickle.  The flavors are all very rich and bold. 111 proof lets you know it's there without becoming a distraction. 

Finish is very long and peppery (both chili and black) with additional notes of cherry and mint. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy which supports the rich flavors.

A truly great and unique whiskey; certainly never tasted anything like it and well worth the $57.  Sweet for a rye, but with crazy depth and complexity so it never gets cloying or boring in it's sweetness.  Instant re-buy."

5.0,"Yet another whiskey that has achieved a cult status derived from a combination of quality and rarity. Let's see if the Willett leaves up to the hype.

Nose: Very bready, doughy, and spicy. Rye bread, dill, and cinnamon, leap out of the glass. High ABV is evident, not unpleasant. Beyond that is cherry, banana (almost like banana bread), toffee, and wintergreen green, rounding out a superb nose.

Palate: Still predominantly rye bread, dill, and cinnamon. Big dose of vanilla now. Something reminiscent of hay. Clove, nutmeg, and pepper compliment the cinnamon spice. Chewy caramel and a distinct banana bread note. Apple cider. Very slight cherry note. Just as spicy, but less fruity than the nose. Even more vegetal and earthy. Very nice.

Finish: The finish goes on damn near forever. Black cherry and white chocolate notes provide rich sweetness. Banana bread and walnut. More of the clove, nutmeg, cinnamon, pepper spice take over once the sweetness disappears. The experience concludes with a woody, oaky note. It's amazing that the finish offers just as much complexity as the palate; I find this an absolute rarity but it's true with this one.

5 stars. Best rye I've had. I say both without reservation. Phenomenal from start to finish. Especially the finish. At $60, it's a steal. Would love to try one of the other age-stated Willett ryes. It seems most of those were one-offs while this is their own only staple offering.

Cannot recommend this stuff enough. If you see it for anywhere near this price point, pull the trigger. I've already said too much. Enjoy!"

Fantastic. I really am blown away by this only being 4 years old. It’s bold and in your face, with heavy rye and baking spice. Chocolate rounds it out in addition to some nice fruit and sweet notes.

This is amazing. Can’t believe it’s 4 years

N(4.5): cinnamon bomb just like the 112. Starts as big red chewing gum then evolves to a red berry cinnamon. Feels creamy and I get a hint of vanilla. A bit of floral and outdoor grassy notes which are light, interesting and delightful. Cupping my hands around the glass and nosing, I get plump juicy bright cherries with a dash of caramel on top. 
P(4.75): sweet red cinnamon. Reminiscent of the nose. Luscious mouth feel
F(4.75): nice creamy hug. Light oakiness that turns into oolong tea. Reminds me of milk tea boba. Same with the 112 earlier on today. Sooooo delicious. I’ve never gotten it from another whiskey. The tea is fresh and vibrant layered with creamy milky vanilla on top."

5.0,Simply my favorite rye.
4.5,"My oh my oh my I'm tasting the fall 2019 batch bottled at 56.3 ABV. 112.6 proof. Nose is all candy sweetness, light caramel and dark dark fruit like sherry finished scotch or whiskey. Stewed fruit of raisin, ripe plums, dark cherry, blackberries and raspberries. Taste DOES NOT DISAPPOINT. All of the notes you get on the nose are on the palate too. The sweet berry notes, the juicy dark cherry, ripe juicy plums the raisins. The honey sweetness is very forward also. The mid palate becomes more of a traditional rye with the rye spice, a bit of an alcohol punch, mild wood notes (think eagle rare), and black pepper. Just before the finish you also get a fleeting touch of black licorice just before the finish. Finish is fairly long but not too dry but you get the wood notes and a slight apple skin bitterness along with apple flavor on the finish along with the return of the blackberries and even something I'll call herbal notes almost like you got a blackberry with some vine/stem attached. This reminds me very much of a sweet blackberry brandy the berry, the sweet and then the alcohol bite or a fortified merlot wine. I've bought 3 bottles can't get enough. If you're a sherry bomb scotch drinker or a sweet bourbon drinker looking for a sweet rye this is it."

Nose - I get liquorice , cherry cough drops, and christmas spices. Water tames the spices and brings out a bit of a custards, but the spices don't stay faded long and come back in force. 

taste - See the nose really. I'm getting perhaps some kind of christmas dessert or you know perhaps even a ginger breadhouse. Yeah the vanilla icing and ginger cookie, I can totally see that here. There's still some cherry cough drops, a bit medicinal for sure, and rye spice. Water might bring out a bit more vanilla and sweet upfront but really not significant adjustments.

WOWED, not by whisky standards, but I must admit this was one I went in with low expectations on and I've been really impressed. I'm at a solid 3.0 here which might be among my highest rye scores, a spirit I like but rarely feel doesn't enough special to move into the higher scored ranges.I won't go back to this often, but it'll be a nice change of pace or perhaps a christmas dram."

Several spices seep in - nutmeg and vanilla being predominant.  Slight burn, but that’s to be expected with a 113+ proof.  Mouthfeel is exceptional - nice coating of tongue with huge flavors.

Finish: While every aspect of this whisky is amazing, the finish is the highlight of this pour. The “Kentucky Hug” seems to last forever and  the flavors linger and even grow stronger.

Unfortunately, one of the most disappointing things for me to notice in a whiskey is when it's too young or when the lack of age detracts from the overall experience. Which, 4 years for a rye isn't really all that young. Other than that it would be a decent sipper, but I think a 6+ year would be a show stopper.

Final Verdict, if you see it: get it and try it for yourself, you might fall in love. But if it's a dollar over retail, I'd hold off."

The fruit comes out with a hint of cherry on the nose and a good orange/citrus flavor on the back end.
