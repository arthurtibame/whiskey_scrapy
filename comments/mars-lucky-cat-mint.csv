2.5,"@Richard-ModernDrinking and I had a tasting last night where we shared a few drams with each other.  This was one of my offerings.  Unfortunately this was tasted right after an amazing Ardbeg Drum CE, so it already had a poor start.  This didn’t make it to my top 5 or 6 out of the 12.  Honey, light...almost like gin lightness.  High grain content, and young.  This was highly allocated and hard to find, sold out in minutes.  Not sure it was worth the quick sell out.  Or maybe it just was badly positioned after the Ardbeg"

4.25,"A beautifully light blend. 

Very complex and sophisticated nose.  Peach, vanilla and honey most apparent, but also hints of passion fruit.

A fruity palette and smooth on the tongue.  After taste doesn’t hang as long as one would like, but waves and layers of flavors do surface."
