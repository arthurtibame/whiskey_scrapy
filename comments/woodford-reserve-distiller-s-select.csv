3.75,"Batch 37
Smooth earthy notes at the beginning slight woody vanilla taste finish has an every so slight harshness."
3.75,The best I can come up with is nothing tastes bad with it.  My tasting skills are just starting to crawl.

4.25,Sweet - almost cherry like on the taste.  A somewhat thin mouthfeel but so sweet.  A little bit of spice on the end.
3.5,"Complex on the front end. Spicy, sweet, and evocative of dried fruit. Woody, lingering finish."

4.25,"This Woodford reserve bottled at 45.2%abv with a chesnut color is a dram i have been wanting to try for a long time. 

On the nose is wonderful, complex and full of layers that change with time. Banana, Spicy on the nose, vanilla Ice cream, METALLIC COINS (Yes. That is one note) and a sweet found in ecuadorian weddings called ""yemita acaramelada"" that translates into ""caramelized egg"". Lovely.

On the palate it is not as good but it is still a good dram. A little Watery at the beggining, then Liquorice, fine Tobacco, Nuts; a Bitter sensation but in a pleasant way.

Mint/ginger finish, long, mouth numbing.
Overall it is a very good dram, worthy in every aspect. 87 over 100. Cheers!"
4.0,Batch 366 - hints of cherry in the nose. Subtle sweetness leads to caramel and then some fire that dies down and lingers through the finish.
