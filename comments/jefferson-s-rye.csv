2.0,"Pine on the nose. Striking at first taste, with subtle pine afterwards. Average. Not bad, but not world-beating. 2.5."
4.0,"Vanilla, rye spice, old leather, shoe polish, juicy fruit, oak, bay leafs, spicy on the taste, lots of wood, and tannins, hint of milk chocolate on the finish. Solid rye. [87]"

4.0,"Superbly smooth, flavorful, and well rounded rye. Subtlety sweet and Spicy. Wish this product was on the shelf all the time."
