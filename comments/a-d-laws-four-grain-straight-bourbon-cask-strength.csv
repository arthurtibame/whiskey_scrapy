3.0,Idk about this one. Had a scotch-esque note is just didn’t love. Wasn’t bad but didn’t strike me like a bourbon should.

4.25,"Same great laws aroma, huge alcohol kick that seems strong even for a cask strength. Deep and sweet. Caramel flavors, very pleasant. Creamy and rich."

4.5,Smooth and flavorful!
4.25,"really good young bourbon. it doesn't taste that young however...tastes pretty similar to a good Barrell bourbon. nice brown sugar and mouthfeel...good apple, cherry and chocolate orange thing going on. Finish is really good...fairly long. Colorado's top bourbons come from Laws."
3.0,Some warmth in the way down
4.0,"Smooth, thicker-bodied, sweeter bourbon. Very good."

3.0,"Smooth start, some afterburn/tingle."
4.0,"Totally agree, smoother and sweeter than expected for a cask strength / barrel proof option. That said, you’ll find the signature potpourri of flavors Laws Whiskey House is becoming known for."
4.25,Molly’s barrel pick. They picked a good one.
1.0,"Skunky and less than tasty. Decent nose, but reeks of ethanol and not in a good way. The taste is light at first then hits you mid palate with ethanol and heat, again not in a good way. Too hot without any flavor nor nuance to make it interesting. Hard pass."
4.25,"Caramel, light vanilla and clove with a orange citrus finish. Easily drinkable for a cask strength."
