4.0,"Pure and neutral, oaky"

4.0,"Nose - orange juice and vanilla jump out at you, with some caramel and oak spice 
Taste - orange peel with bitterness, vanilla cream and caramel, some barrel spice in the background 
Finish - a light citrus sweetness lingers, a bit of spice at the back of your tongue, very gentle heat"
3.5,"Nose is raisins, figs, and plums.  Palate is ditto with a spurt of spice.  Following sips reveal hints of vanilla and toffee. Oaky, sweet and spicy finish.  This could be better than the Sherry Oak Cask 12!

3.5,"Honey, citrus, caramel"
4.25,"Pronounced Oak flavor with a light hint of fruit.  Decently smooth, but still feels like a sequel to the triple casked 15 year.  Still very good."

3.0,"GLASS:
Dalmore Glencairn Copita Nosing Glass

NOSE:
Neat - Honey, vanilla, baking spices, and golden raisins and stewed apple. Very feminine with no smoke or peat. 
With 8 drops of water and a 2 minutes of rest - The honey, vanilla, baking spices take a back seat to the scent of warm straw/hay. The golden raisins and stewed apple remain.

PALATE:
Neat - Honey, citrus and ginger (as it said on the box). Also raisin, oak and a hint of jalapéno pepper. Long finish.
With 8 drops of water and a 2 minutes of rest - No significant change. I’ll drink this neat in the future. 

CONCLUSION:
If this Scotch was a person it would be named Doug. Solid but unremarkable.  
$69.95 USD per Bottle"

3.75,"Revisiting this one.  I had it for the first time at a Macallan tasting and wasn't overly impressed.  But its not fair to the whisky to let a first impression be an only impression when the pedigree is this refined.  Time to slow down and pay attention.

This expression has a story.  I remember hearing this at the tasting, but it didn't really register at the time. This is from ScotchNoob.com review of this Macallan ""This is something new, folks. Macallan takes new American oak (NOT ex-bourbon!) and “seasons” it by filling it with sherry for an undisclosed period of time. These “seasoned” American oak sherry casks are then used to age Macallan for at least 12 years. This whisky is then blended with traditional Macallan aged in European oak sherry casks and bottled at 43% ABV for the American market.""

I enjoyed this taste is neat from a small snifter glass.  The bottle is a few months old and about 2/3rds full, so it's had opportunity for some meaningful oxidation.  I gave the pour about 10 minutes to rest. The color is brassy and a swirl shows some sheeting and a number of small tears running down the side of the glass.  

On the nose I get immediate notes of sweet sherry with notes of vanilla and a hint of candy orange slices.  Barrel wood is in the mix, and my wife picked out a note she said reminded her of an upscale butcher shop - meaty.  I didn't quite get there, but definitely get something that reminds me of fresh chesnuts.  This has an interesting nose, its not so fascinating first whiff, but as you pay attention to subtle elements you find complexity.

On the palette this is soft, sweet, sherried, polite and reserved.  There's a short delay between the swallow and the blush of pepper that remains. There's nothing technicolor about this.  Nothing brash, nothing flashy.  It's lovely... but I don't love it.

This is a very good, very polite dram.  So polite its boring.  Watery even.  I can't imagine this on ice.  I should try a drop of water to see how it changes the drink, but this isn't something I'd want to mix or use in a cocktail. Its a very refined, very approachable, sweet scotch whisky that is best enjoyed on its own terms - neat and casual."

3.5,"A light but slightly annoying alcoholic whiff greets the nose, taking more than necessary to abandon the smell, which as expected is sherried but not too much: ripe plums, cinnamon, cherries, toffee, honey, lemon zest. Persistent background wood.
A slightly metallic trace is presented with every sip, in a rather dry drink, always a little too alcoholic for its 40 degrees, elements that break the aromas, leaving the fruity and soft hints in the background, with traces of hazelnuts, raisins in spirit, plums, spices (with a slight peppery touch), lemon and a light herbaceous note. More wood to embrace everything.
Medium finish, dry, of alcohol, hazelnuts, cinnamon, wood.
A whisky that I would call negligible, at that price (and even less) and with that aging you can finde better stuff (Tomatin 12yo or GlenAllachie 12yo are much better, or remaining in the declared double maturations, a Balvenie 12yo), of the Macallan's proverbial elegance you find very little here, replaced by a lot of disorder and sloppiness."

3.25,"A very soft, tasty single malt. The nose shows some of the raisin notes you would expect for a sherry cask, but not much of it show up on the palate. The palate is very honeyed sweet, with vanilla and a bit of citrus in an relatively oily texture. The finish is pretty disappointing, and where this one loses most of its points for me, it drops off almost immediately. Not a bad whiskey, just better options available for the price. Would gladly drink if offered, but wouldn't buy a bottle."

2.25,"Nose: The cask aroma comes through strong. Very much a sherry/malty smell with hints of citrus.

Palate: Smokey and a little oily to me. Oaky flavor comes through with hints of syrup and vanilla.

Finish: Smokiness lingers and sweetness is just on the tail end. The vanilla and citrus are more prominent here than on the palate.

Overall Thoughts: I don’t hate it. I wouldn’t turn down a glass. But the sherry cask flavor is just not my go-to. Kinda leaves a taste in my mouth that feels like it’s trying a little too hard to impress."

4.0,"Nose is sherry, fruits, dark chocolate, honey, and a hint of spice. Nose reminds me of a Dalmore 12, and the beginning of the plate does as well. Sweet sherry, fruits and a bit of nuttiness start the palate then give way to a bright and spicy honey."
4.5,Smooth and sweet! Smells like an ice cream parlor. This was my first taste of the macallan after ghost rider
