4.5,"Neat.  Lots of caramel and oak on the nose.  Vanilla and cherry with a decent dose of spice under it all.  An interesting blend of back and forth high notes and low notes.  Swaying from the oak to caramel to vanilla to spice.  Hint of mint and maybe even clove as you spend more time with it.

On the taste the initial flavors were surprising and dark.  Brown sugar, maple, and hint of that spice.  Transitions to a hint of orange to a bomb of vanilla.  Ends with even more vanilla and a hint of pepper.  Legs last for quite a while.

Quite a delicious treat!"

4.5,"Sweet oak, caramel and a hint of spice."
4.0,"Neat.  Opened around a year.  Been a long long time since I cracked open this bottle.  On the nose, I am quite surprised by be smell.  Lots of fruits and floral. Apples, apricots, and even oranges and lemon.  Beyond the fruits and floral brightness, the familiar MGP starts emerging.  Graham cracker, rye, lightly charred caramel.

Nice, thick and creamy texture.  Apple cinnamon on the tongue.  Hits you with the apricot and transitions to more familiar MGP territory again on the finish with the rye and charred caramel.  The finish is a bit lacking and a little tannic even.

Really enjoyed this but my MGP experience has expanded substantially since the first time I had this.  The fruits and floral are so interesting, but it’s not a flavor bomb and the finish is just okay.  The aftertaste is a slight turn off even.  There is better MGP for the same price."

3.5,"Classic MGP on the nose, plus... bananas. Nice oak touch. On the palate, smooth, tastes like a rickhouse smells. A sharp wood note creeps in, with rye notes. Pecan nibs. Balanced sweetness. The spice level seems about to kick in, but then doesn't. Some spice lingers but it's not a firecracker. Bananas show up again on the finish. 8/24/19"

4.5,Lots of caramel and nougat with some orange brûlée. Sweet finish with more caramel that is a bit fleeting but delightful nonetheless.
