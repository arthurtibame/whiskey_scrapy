3.0,Very sweet. Desert whiskey
1.75,"Very sweet with strong cinnamon flavor. Reminiscent of apple pie moonshine that I’ve had. 

Cutting it with some ice helps the drinkability as I’m not so much into sweet whiskey."
2.5,Way to sweet for daily sipping. Will be good for cocktails.

5.0,"I've never before seen a flavored whiskey over 70 proof, much less more than 100 proof. The fact that this is 103 proof - you would never know by drinking it. So smooth. And mixed into cocktails is amazing. I prefer this over their BSB 60 proof version. My wife likes the 60 proof version, this 103 proof version is my ""go to"" now. A definite must try, even for the most discerning whiskey fan. Perfect to pass around the tailgates this football season."
