5.0,"Amazing. Briny, chocolatey, gasoline peat

Caol Ila 12/Talisker 10/No Name 2 side-by-side-by-side:

Caol Ila is briny and bright gasoliney. Talisker is sweet and caramely (and of course mineraly)

Caol Ila hits first then the talisker finishes"
1.5,"How do you follow up a popular but not superlative whisky? Why of course by changing every single thing about it! Too lazy to look up the ages for this review, but as memory serves this is a much younger and perhaps ""cheaper"" follow up in terms of quality, a recurring theme with compass box. Still, it sounds tasty and they upped the use of sherry casks. 

Nose - Soft peaty notes, cream, butter, and a bit of fruity notes. I get just a golden malty goodness with light peat and some waxy fruits. I'm getting excited to taste this.

Taste - There's not much here. I can get the light sherry. There's a citrus and oaky bitter note. Then some nice all but it muted peat. There's just not a lot here. I knew to expect a very light peated version, but I'm not getting much. There's a lot of pepper that's starting to come through, reminding me of the talisker in it. 

Overall this isn't a terrible whisky but I don't think this is a winner. 1.5. 2.0 being average and frankly this is below average."

4.0,Peat on the nose and smoke on the tongue with a sweat finish. Very unique whiskey!

P: sweet tar, sherried peat, chocolate brine

F: full, robust, chocolate"
4.75,"Spend a few minutes on the nose. Silky layers of balanced vanilla, smoke, fruit,  and malt. So lovely and complex.

Sip and the middle opens to even more floral layers of fruit and subtle cake frosting so balanced with smoke and salt.  What is this magic?  It pulls you in for more.

The mouthfeel is pleasantly oily, sliding into a long, not too over bearing, peaty melt.

My favorite of 33 tastes at Tampa Bay's 'Whiskey Tampa Foxtrot'."
4.0,"This was one of more than two dozen whiskies I sampled at the Whisky Show, so don’t expect nuanced notes or a meaningful rating. What I can say is that it is very different from its Ardbeg-led predecessor and perhaps as delicious. I got two distinct pulses of flavor - a blast of peat followed by a wave of richer sherry notes. It’s an unusual two-step structure that suggests this is a sequel akin more to Godfather II than Jaws: The Revenge. I eagerly await an opportunity for a more considered tasting."
