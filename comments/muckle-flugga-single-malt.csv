3.0,"I have no clue what the hell a Muckle Flugga is - can't be Gaelic / sounds like a name cooked by Jim Henson - but it was surprisingly delicious. 

There's oak and vanilla on the nose (bourbon), with honey and carnation on the palate. It's balanced but weak, and the low ABV hinders. 

Still not bad. Cheers!"
