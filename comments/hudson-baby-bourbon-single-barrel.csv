3.25,"Picked up a store pick single barrel bottle yesterday.

I find it to be better than the “regular” Baby Bourbon. Lots of CORN on the nose upon pouring then opens up to sweet, salty caramel, oaky notes. On the palate it is thin but all aforementioned notes discernible. Finish is somewhat short and dry...Easy drinking, neat sipper."
