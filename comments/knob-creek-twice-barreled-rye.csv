2.5,"Had this as an after dinner dram having heard that it was in the sweeter side. It seems like everyone is doing a double barreled finish these days and Knob Creek decided to join in the fun with this limited release. The exception being they did it with their rye vs bourbon. They also release at a sub $50 price point, which is pretty low for a limited expression (cask strength SRP was $70). On to the tasting:
On the pallette it's full and robust with an initial burst or rye spice and pepper that quickly moves to rich vanilla and smoky oak flavor. That carries thru the mid pallette all the way to the medium finish which brings back some spice. 
This is definitely a sweet dram the reminded of a richer less complex Angels Envy Rye. It's way to sweet to be anything more than an occasional pour, unless that is your thing. I would also argue that while it's not priced poorly for a limited expression, I would not recommend buying it. The Knob standard rye and Single Barrel are both better options. As an occasional after dinner dram it's worth a try  but nothing more. 
Cheers all."

3.75,"Nose is caramel forward with adjoining aromas of butterscotch, cardamom, nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla wafers, baked apples, and faint whiffs of peppermint.  In the palate, there is barrel char, baking spice, spiced apples, fruity pepper, grass clippings, and more cardamom.  For all the caramel in the nose, it is only semisweet and dries slightly as it moves into a punchy, spicy finish with added notes of pecan and cocoa butter.  Ample rye character and restrained barrel characteristics given its double casking—especially if expecting a rye equivalent of, say, Woodford Reserve Double Oaked, although the finish remains quite smooth."
4.25,"Good neat, better in an old fashioned"
4.0,Sweet rye
4.0,"The nose on this one is extremely inviting. It pushes hard with notes of butterscotch, buttered popcorn, musty oak, and a bit of spearmint. The palate, while a bit tame and thin for a 100 proof rye, is quite complex. Heavy baking spices like cinnamon, cloves, ginger, , allspice, and even a bit of cardamom start things off. Things then develop into a rich buttery sweetness full of toffee, burnt caramel, maple syrup, orange zest, and an odd, but not off putting note of tarragon. The finish is all baking spices and toasted sugars, with a pleasant, rolling warmth in the chest. Overall an extremely pleasant whiskey and a fantastic rye for the money. 

$14 USD for a pour at SFO"
3.5,"Woody, some vanilla, heavy notes of toasted pecans and nuts. Surprisingly soft and smooth for a 100 proof."

5.0,Great pour.  Very smooth
3.25,Meh.....expected a bit more. It’s not bad at all but not great either
4.0,Usually prefer a wheated bourbon but enjoying this.
2.5,"First tasting, served neat. This is a dark whiskey, really like the color. Definitely get some sweetness on the nose. Taste is sweet as well, lots of vanilla/caramel. The sweetness lingers on the tongue. Where it's falling short of me is the finish. The finish to me is pretty harsh. But not a proof harshness, as I've also been sipping Jim BiB which is also 100 proof. There's a flavor I can't quite place on the finish that comes across pretty harsh and lingers for a bit, ruining the experience. I paid $18 for this, and glad I did not pay more. I'll try with ice next visit to see if that improves the finish."

4.5,"I call bull on the 100 proof, the heat isn't there. The signature rye spice is very subtle and is more present in the aftertaste. I can't place the aroma at the forefront but there is very little to no ethanol on the nose. Great whiskey to enjoy neat if you like the spice of rye."
3.75,"The smell is absolutely fantastic, full of cinnamon candies and potent barrel wood. The initial taste is a bit disappointing, as I'm not getting a 100 proof vibe, nor is the rye immediately obvious. However, after letting the whiskey move over the tongue, I can now tell that, although the double barreling gave a huge boost to the oak and caramel flavor, it really mellowed out Knob Creek's rye product. Now, instead of bright grass and cinnamon, I taste deeper spices, like clove and anise. Given the amazing smell and the strong wood finish, this is a good unique bottle to have to compare other rye bases to."
3.0,"A bit disappointed. A bit too subdued.

I noticed the slightest hint of marshmallow sweetness, with notes of milk chocolate and cinnamon. Spicy-ish and thin. A smooth drinker, with no discernible alcohol burn, and a short finish.

I generally really like twice barreled bourbons and rye, but I want more sweetness, chocolate, char, or marshmallow from this like i usually associate with second barreling. It drinks well enough but not much different than a regular rye or high rye bourbon.

I wonder if it would be better at a higher proof."

3.75,"Along with High West Rendezvous Rye, Knob Creek Twice Barreled Rye is pretty much exactly what rye should taste like. Imagine sharp, soft rye bread with a little honey (just a little, not the toffee sweetness of other ryes) and a little more pepper, and a slight aftertaste of heat and iodine. The warmth stays on the fillings but not in the throat or the tongue, which makes this a ""low-affect"" rye, and low-affect ryes usually don't taste nearly as pure, sharp, and fresh as Knob Creek Twice Barreled. Not the top of the food chain, but close enough, a treasure to sip, and a winner."
