5.0,Very clean. Crisp drink. Guest fav.
2.0,Very harsh and difficult to enjoy. None of my whiskey buddies wanted more than a sip. We visited the distillery in Sep 2015 and they had a nice variety of products but I would recommend their cherry gin over this.  They will have a rye whisky offering in 2016 after it finishes aging so I look forward to that.
3.0,Nice smooth clean taste.

4.0,"Surprisingly nice, considering most of the exciting stuff happens during the barrel aging process. 
Easy to drink Rye with a very pleasant taste left on the palate."

3.0,Very very very unique. So different than anything I have tasted before. But a nice alternative for mixed drinks.
