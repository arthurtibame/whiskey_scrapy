3.0,"Lauder's Blended Scotch 🤷‍♂️
Sight 🧐 ; Light straw-coloured,
Nose 👃; Caramel and malt sweetness, slight fruit at the end,
Taste 👅 ; Light spice and smoke, caramel, slight dryness, 
Finish 🇫🇮 ; Smooth, medium length with some more fruits, mostly apricots and apples,

6 / 10 🥃

A little to light and smooth for my palate, even tho it's nicely balanced I'd like some thing that excites me some more."
