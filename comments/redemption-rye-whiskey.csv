2.0,"""Great for Whiskey Sour's"", but as a sipper in the evening on it's own, nope, not going to happen. On a personal note, this bottle is not alone when it comes to over saturating the market right now in the bottling  of Rye/Bourbon's in the market place, over production with mediocre product just to turn a buck. Sorry, but this stuff to is much $$, for a market loaded with Rye's that are far better."

4.0,Good rye. Apple/pear with the grassy rye notes on the nose. Spicy. Rounded on the palette with a spicy finish. Lingering dark caramel and brown sugar notes.
