5.0,Battle cry is a great sipping drink. I first had it at a tasting at the distillery. A must have for locals.

2.0,"[Whiskey Live NY 2018] - I'm actually not sure which iteration of the single malt I tasted, but I did not like it!  Youthful grainy banana taste that comes from something that hasn't quite graduated yet.  Other than the design of the bottle, typography, and Metal Gear Solid reference that I so wish the name comes from, I'm already on to the next table."

3.0,Solid American Single malt.  Lighter than Scotch.  Early malt flavor fades into a thin but pleasant and persistent peppery finish.  More like 3.5 stars.
3.0,"Patiently waited for this to go on sale. Glad I did. It's very good, don't get me wrong. But it's a funky, kinda stretch whiskey. I'm going to enjoy getting to know all the heat and spice in this sipper."
