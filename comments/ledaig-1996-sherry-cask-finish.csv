3.5,Once briefly the Ledaig flame burned bright for me but now not really a fan. Very acetone nose which translates to the palate with metallic bitter quite acidic peat. The sherry casking is like a rider thrown off their horse with their foot still stuck in the stirrip being dragged along behind as the horse goes whatever way it wants...i.e. very much not in charge. It does impart a nice xmas cake type of flavour however. I initially thought it's very much a love or hate type of style of whisky but then I find myself both not liking the concept it delivers but still drinking it...it's force of character is definitely an attraction.
