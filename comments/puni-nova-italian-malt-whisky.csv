4.25,"An italian malt. I got to tell that i have never heard of it before a year ago, and i actually think it is quite new in the market. I really liked it, i dont think it is too expensive and it definitively is a good whisky. 

Bottled at 43%abv, with a white wine color almost transparent.

On the nose, nice notes: Chocolate, Peat or expired rotten cream, Tobbacco leaf, Olives and Nutmeg. 

On the palate, Tobacco, thick Peanutbutter (thick to chew also), Ashy.

The Finish is medium long, ashy, spicy and herbal. Very balanced dram. 

Overall this is a very nice dram, specially for the price. I give this baby an 88 over 100. Very recommended."

3.75,"Surprisingly good - I thoroughly enjoyed this whisky. 

Fruity on the nose (probably the highlight) with notes of apricot (allegedly it's banana), honey and vanilla. The palate is something that strongly resembles a classic Speyside - very floral. The finish is short with some oak lingering on the tongue. 

Not flawless, and quite immature, but I'm glad I bought this one. Plus I gots to represent my peeps in Italy. 

Cheers!"
