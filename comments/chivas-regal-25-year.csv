5.0,"Liquid gold. One of the best whiskies I’ve had to date. I could careless if it’s blended, it’s of supreme quality from Chivas who produce nothing but tremendous drams. The nose is excellent: caramel, honey, vanilla, treacle, and mixed fruits. The grains are extremely mature. No alcohol on the nose either. The palate is a swish of brilliance and the finish is beyond smooth. This is definitely better than the 18 (which is excellent too). The price is worth it for sure. 100/100 easy"
4.25,"A very luxury dram, very easy drinkable, as most fancy blends it is delicious and not so complex. The aroma and tasting notes are very clean and made for everyone.

Bottled at 40%abv, golden color.

On the nose is sweet and appealing: toasted oak, dry honey, herbal vanilla, raisins and almonds. When you let it breathe it releases more dehydrated fruits, figs and raisins.

On the palate is very winey and smooth. Herbal, rum, oak (lots of oak due to its 25yo), honeycomb. 

Aftertaste is medium long, very rewarding and herbal. 

In conclusion this is a fine dram. Not very complex but very enjoyable. A little straightforward but very well crafted. 89/100."

3.0,"Very dark collar, nice look in the glass. The whiskey smells grainy and well balanced. The first sip is surprisingly light. Then come the dry fruits, peach, peppery, slightly smoky, and cinnamon. The after taste is very good and stays quiet long, tho no lagavullin 16YO. Pretty divers but you can also say: all over the place. Price quality I would expected better. Packaging is very very nice tho"

5.0,This is probably one of the smoothest blended whisky I've had and the smoke and vanilla at the back end is a nice treat - well done

4.0,"Dried fruits, orange, peach, vanilla, light bodied and well balanced. DFS for 300usd, one half star plus."
3.75,"Dramfest `18. Dram no. 3 day two. Waxy, vanilla, mild, very small hint of smoke. 3.75. Not worth the nearly $400USD a bottle."
