3.25,"Number 2 at the Glendronach tasting tonight and man this was collectively judged not a good dram. Very plasticky, chemically. This was the most expensive at $600USD as well. Can't believe RB let this get out the door. 

Update: Dramfest 2020. Ah crap another Glendronach master tasting and this showed up. Maybe not as plasticky but I think still they are trying to get rid of this crap...why bottle it? Luckily I also got to try the Grandeaur  24 yr and 25 year Master Vintages which saved the day but I'd be pissed if there were three of these..."
