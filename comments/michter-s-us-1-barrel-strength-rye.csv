2.75,"Nose- Caramel; rye spice; Swedish fish; anise

Palate- Cinnamon red hots initially; spiced oak; leather

Fish- Medium, spicy finish; rye spice; spiced oak 


Not my favorite pour in the world. Pretty simple although out. The highlight is a unique aroma of Swedish fish. Not much to say about this one, so here’s a list of ryes I like more than this that are cheaper:


Old Forester Rye
Elijah craig rye
Whistle Pig 10
Sazerac (baby)"

4.5,Michters marshmallow and cedarwood sauna nose with interesting rye spice. Taste is surprisingly not typical rye burn but really long with super strong tobacco coming through after 5-10s. Great!

4.25,"This one is a banger. Almost done with the bottle I grabbed last may. I've had a lot of time to see it develop over that time. 
Age: NAS
Nose: caramel, cherry, vanilla, spice cake
Palate: Viscous (Not Cornerstone viscous though) oily. Not super spicy. Apple, allspice, vanilla. Mouth coating. 
Finish: fairly long. Great hug. Solid minute or so. Perhaps the weakest link however. 
This is an extremely easy drinking barrel proof rye. I did a side by side with cornerstone...twice. it fell short of that, but it's $100 less. For the price, it's incredible. It's definitely a sweet rye...not spicy. If you're looking for a Willett type experience you will be disappointed. If you're a bourbon lover, this rye will be your jam."

4.0,"This one is classic rye! The bump up in alcohol content helps the flavors. On the nose you get the expected sweet mint, clove and sugar. The palate finds a surprising gentle profile of mint, anise and brown sugar. This whiskey fills the mouth ends with a spicey kick! A good barrel proof rye."

3.0,"Big hearty Rye bite here.   Exceptionally hot.

High alcohol content and very Rye forward make this a hard swallow.  Big boy pants are required.

Consumed neat the spice lingers forever across the full palate.  

A couple of generous drops of water subdues the heat.  But the spice tingle continues.  

Mine was the 2015 release @ 109 proof."

4.0,Good... Just sort of leaves me wanting a bit more. Would rather have a bottle of Rendezvous Rye or a WhistlePig (barrel strength or 10/10/100) for the money...
4.0,"Smells like maple syrup and fruit. Intense on the palate, with layers and layers of flavors. It's sweet and spicy with some floral notes, warm with a decently long finish of wood, cinnamon, and chocolate. This will make me a fan of rye. Well done. 4/6/17"

4.0,"114 proof bottle.  Wow, this stuff is really good.  Nose is vanilla and spicy, which follows through to the palate.  For being 114 proof this is smooth and syrupy.  Tasted this side-by-side Michter's 10 year rye and I think this is a better value than the 10 year.  The barrel strength makes a huge difference."

5.0,"This juice is outstanding. The nose is an excellent and complex bouquet of flavors. The palate is much the same, albeit a tad thin and the finish is great. This is outstanding. I cannot believe the score for this Dram is so much lower than that turd Woodford Rye.....someone getting their back scratched???"

4.0,"(Barrel #16D464 | 56.2% ABV)  Nose - Oaky spicy vanilla, hint of dark/burnt sugars, faint cherry cough syrup sweetness.
  Taste - Juicy dark red berries, faint sweet mint, light vanilla caramel, cinnamon spice on the back palate, lightly bitter oaked sweet white wine.
  Finish - Lingering mouth warmth, lightly drying. Watered down oaked sour cherries with a sweet herbal tail.
  Score - 86/100
  Final Thoughts - Looking back at my notes it's nice to see they are pretty similar to the ""standard"" Single Barrel offering of their rye which is nice to know at least they're somewhat consistent. That being said, they both have gone through their ""signature filtration"" process which I think has sadly removed some of the more complex flavors that might make this more interesting. This is a somewhat fruity rye which I do like, but it's still a bit muted. Unlike the standard rye, the higher proof might help this stand out in cocktails a bit more but otherwise it seems pretty boring, albeit sippable. I'm not sure I'd pick up another bottle especially for the price I typically see it sold for."

4.0,"Very inviting nose. Vanilla, Carmel, sweet bread. Quite sweet on the initial palate and begins to spice up as it rolls to the back of the tongue. Short finish but overall very enjoyable and wants me to keep drinking more"

5.0,"Amazing - thickest, most flavorful rye out there."
4.0,"Michter’s US*1 Barrel Strength Rye
Barrel No 15C285
Classification: Kentucky Straight Rye
Proof: 109.2 (54.6%)
Age: NAS
Mashbill: Undisclosed
Distillery: Sourced
Bottled: Michter’s Distillery, Louisville, KY
Price: $65 - $75
Color: Light Copper
Nose: Alcohol present but not overpowering, vanilla, butter cream, citrus, toast
Palate: Honey, rye spicy, warm, full but not thick, apple, black cherry, touch of oak
Finish: Long, warm in the mouth and chest, lingering heat, cinnamon toast, nutmeg, smallest touch of acetone
Personal Rating: 7/10
Notes: Overall, I enjoyed this pour. To be Barrel strength, it still has a proof a little in the lower end, so it is fairly easy to drink. I love how this almost makes me think of like a combination of breakfast and dessert with notes of honey and toast, as well as fruit and vanilla. Altogether the aroma and palate were very pleasant. The finish isn’t too bad but with this bottle I did get the tiniest little bit of an acetone note at the end, it didn’t ruin the drink for me, but I would have to put it in the negative category. Additionally, I feel like the bottle is a little high on the price for what it is. $65 - $75 seems a little much when there are other ryes out there similarly priced that I enjoy more. Lastly, while the prof isn’t super high, I definitely recommend a little water to open up some of the more subtle aromas that are behind the warmth of the alcohol and bold spice flavors of the rye. Let the glass sit out a little as well as I feel it gets better the longer you sip"

3.25,"Another classic example of someone in the kentucky area needing to get whisky shipped back to the kentucky area.  

Nose - Christmas spice, wheat toast, vanilla and mint together, some under cooked yeasty bread, 

Taste - spice, mint, rye bread, oak, caramel, and some tobacco.  Really complex, could use some age to mellow out a few rough notes (see the 10 year rye which I can't get but tried last night for what age can do).  

Very nice and a must get for a rye fan.  I don't any of those off putting dill notes, the oak is there and not that overly young stuff.  This will be a super high end cocktail mixer that is worth the premium and because of that, I'm going 3.25 as this has some special notes."

3.5,"I tried a pour of Michter’s US*1 Barrel Strength Rye at a whisk(e)y bar that was recommended to me along with a pour of Pikesville Straight Rye (reviewed separately). This sample was from a 2019 release and bottled at 55.4% ABV, a touch higher than the Pikesville. 

As with my review for that dram, I didn’t feel it was the right setting to take detailed notes and dissect every element of it. So I‘m going with an overall “impressions” tasting. To cut to the chase, I actually preferred the Pikesville Straight Rye. The Michter’s Barrel Strength Rye was very spicy, drank like 110+ proof, and was not as rich or flavorful to my tastebuds. And, at about $80 a bottle, I don’t think you’re getting as good VFM. With its profile, I feel like you’d just be purchasing an expensive, ultra-premium mixer. Or you’d be buying it knowing you’re always going to have it with a large cube of ice like the Distiller review suggests. 

I’d rate the Michter’s Barrel Strength Rye a 3.5, but if I was taking cost into higher consideration, I might go with 3.25. Thankfully I only tried a pour; I don’t think I’d seek a bottle."
