3.5,"Very different, extra kick. Solid whisky. Extra flare to a hot todie"
3.0,"This local  bourbon has thin oily legs, the brown color of a cooked donut, and is cloudy as a typical Seattle day.

The nose is quite light and sweet with notes of faint corn dust, floral wheat and flowers, sweet red apple, vanilla, graham cracker, and milk chocolate malt balls.

The palate has notes of sweet Thanksgiving creamed corn, fruity sour Trolli candy, lemon, caramel, and honey.
Finish: The finish is lingering with a note of sweet tea.

This is a very different bourbon. It’s good, not the best, and pretty mild. The flavors though are so unique it’s an interesting ride! I’d recommend a taste if you’re in the area. Cockpit Craft Distillery, thanks for the juice and for your service! Cheers!"
