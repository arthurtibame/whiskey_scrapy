4.0,Fruity and rather clean
3.75,"Found this today at a little out of the way liquor store near the job site for about $60. On the bottle it says was distilled in 1983 and bottled in 1994 at 43% abv. Couldn't find much info on it, so I took a gamble and hoped it was good.
For the initial tasting I get orchard fruit, sherry, a little oak, some honey and slight anise on the nose, the palate is creamy, rich, warm and smooth, the finish is longish and very pleasant with some raisin notes.
Overall, I am very happy with this whiskey purchase. I may have to go back and buy the other 3 bottles."
