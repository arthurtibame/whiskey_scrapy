4.0,"The only thing keeping this from receiving a 5 from me is that it's a smidgeon too hot; my guess is that since it's an NAS, the whisky's still on the young side. That being said, this is a prime example of what you miss out on if you write off NAS whisky for reasons of principle (or snobbery). The nose is bursting at the seams with coconut cream pie, lush vanilla, nutmeg, and an array of orchard fruits. The palate, despite a little burn from the youthful spirit, is equally full and abounding in sweet, rich, luscious coconut, vanilla, ripe fruits, and spice, with a little schmear of chocolate on the palate toward the end of the finish. If the worst thing I can say about this dram is that it's just a trifle too young, then we have a winner - and for a song. I picked this up for less than $40!"

3.5,Nice vanilla and sweet notes. Very little bite. I would drink this again.

3.0,"A bit too spicy for my taste. The tasting notes say, “The palate is soft and light creamy...”. Light and creamy I would agree with, but not soft. Sharp initially, spicy, a bit harsh, followed by a smooth, light fruitiness.

It’s okay for a change of pace, but I probably won’t be buying another."

3.0,"Received this as a surprise gift from a nephew and his fiance last Easter after making a joke about what they could bring for the dinner (""a single malt would be nice""). Lovely little dram and a great bargain for the money. 92 proof and burns like it's higher, especially with some drawn air. Rarely drink anything other than neat ... and as everyone's tastebuds and nose are different, I'll only say there is little peat, good fruit and decent complexity. Just finishing the bottle now and waiting for yet another nephew (brother to the first)  and his wife and son to arrive for the 4th of July. Family, good food, good whiskey and a great American Holiday. Doesn't get much better in my book."

3.5,"Fan of the 10 year and Bradan Orach this was next up the food chain. Poured neat , fresh red apple and wood with some good malt notes. Light and inviting. Palate is alive with fruity malt, some vanilla and heavy dose of oak. Must be the first fill casks coming through. Finishes with drying malt and oak, distant fading fruit (apple) and vanilla. This reminds me of Ancnoc 12 and Glenfiddich Bourbon barrel combined. Has the lively fruit and malt with the vanilla and oak. Dry finish but very fresh enjoyable scotch especially at $33. This is one I will repurchase............85/100.........really all the Speyburn line is good quality and value"

4.5,"Talk about a single malt bang for your buck! Great nose, complex palate, and even a long finish"
3.75,"Nose:
Honey, light oak, parmesan, floral, mint tea
Palate:
Honey, coffee, hazelnut, spice
Finish:
Oak, honey
The finish is medium and a little underwhelming, compares favorably to Ben Nevis 10yr."
