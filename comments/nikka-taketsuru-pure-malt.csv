4.0,A floral bouquet with a touch of sweet on the nose chased by rich baked desert taste that reprises itself a beater after the initial taste. A couple drops of water softens the bite and opens up the bouquet just a bit more without compromising the richness too much. A relatively even body with a nice full finish.

4.0,I agree with Kevin. Lots of fruit and nut on the nose Big tannin and wood tastes. It's okay but a little disappointing. Update: I have to admit this whiskey grows on you. Maybe it's just my palate is developing. Or The Whisky benefits from exposure to air

3.0,"Very fruity nose, the sherry influences are evident. After a little while, wood notes are featured as well. I'm not sure if this is peated, but I sense a whiff of iodine as well, and that carries over to the palate. On the tongue I get an initial burst of iodine which stays throughout. Silky, some bitter wood, and more heat than you would expect from this proof. Sharp, some citrus notes, smoke. The warmth lingers. I haven't had any of the age statement versions, but this one seems like it would hold up against a comparably priced scotch. 3/14/17"

4.0,"An old friend living in Japan shared a tiny 200ml bottle with me, produced for the native market, with almost no English on the label!

Nose: a little hot at first, light charcoal, dark toffee, traces of shoe polish and sautéed mushrooms.

Palate: sharp, grilled apples and pears, nutty, hints of floral soapiness.

Finish: full and tart, rich oak, a little brilliant and unexpected pistachio note lingers longest! Pleasantly surprised, reminds me of a Highland Park or Benromach (although not quite as deep, smooth or balanced). Wish I'd the chance to try their aged bottlings...

Dry Glass: sweet pistachio!"

3.0,Japonska degustacja M$P 2017
3.0,"I’m finally easing into the Japanese whisky craze so I decided to try some of the newer, NAS blends.  First up is the Taketsuru Pure Malt from Nikka.  This NAS whisky replaces the age statement 12 year old, as the Japanese are suffering from the same fate as scotch whisky producers- low inventory.  This blend uses malt from 2 distilleries: Yoichi and Miyagikyo.  Both are basically 10 year old stock, with the Miyagikyo being the primary malt used here.  I’m not sure of the exact percentages.  This one comes in at 43% ABV and is a rich, caramel color that doesn’t really make any legs in the tasting glass.  Oily.

The nose is heavily spiced with traces of new, shoe leather and alcohol astringency.  The charred oak could easily be mistaken for smoke here, IMO, even though it’s pretty muted.  The palate is pretty uneventful:  lots of smooth, sherry sweetness that turns towards heavy pepper and oak barrel shavings by mid sip.  The finish is somewhat long, while remaining sweet and reminiscent of malted breakfast syrup.  I don’t really get anything that screams Japanese whisky, but then again I’m pretty new to this style.  I even added a few drops of water to see if something materialized, but all it did was mute everything else even further, so that’s not recommended.

Overall, this one’s mediocre and nothing new or ultimately interesting.  It’s still a highly drinkable malt and it’s also on the cheaper side with prices around $55 for a 750ml bottle.  I also purchased the 17 year old version of this particular malt and I really hope there’s a lot more to that one.  This one is a solid 3, nothing more.  Here’s to expanding one’s horizons.  Cheers, my friends."

4.0,"Jesus, the smell of it. One note. Clean. Opening like medicine or perfume, then just smoothing out. Ever run your nose gently over a woman’s arm, just kind of slowly breathing in until you feel goosebumps rise on her skin? That’s the smell. Beckoning. Whispering. Try me. I was made for you.

Oh it just sits on your tongue and then vibrates a little. Hold it there. It’s gentle but this is not tame whiskey. It tickles. I can’t find any particular flavor cause the feeling of it is so strong. It’s alive. It lives.

And then the swallow. It gathers and slides. And God love me, the boosh at the end is amazing. It goes down with a light burn and then just before it’s disappears it sneaks back up and kisses the roof of your mouth.

Then it’s gone."

3.0,"No peat or smoke detected here, but a sweet marshmallow pillowy cloud comes to mind with bananas and orange. Unfortunately, the palate doesn’t follow through. At 43% ABV, I was hesitant to add any water at all, but I felt that I should give it a fighting chance.  It just tames the alcohol taste a little, but nothing remains.  No finish to speak of, which is also strange to me. The theme of this dram has to be “Big Empty” by Stone Temple Pilots. 2.75.  Thanks for the sample though Lee. I think an older offering would be worth a look, but with the prices on Japanese whiskies the way they are, I am in no hurry."

3.0,"Japanese whisky tasting evening, Sydney 28 March 18, Whisky #4.

Nose: Big cereal notes, sweetly fragrant and fruity, some light oak in the background.

Palate: Spicy arrival, developing more spice plus considerable cereal sweetness. Chocolate, baked orchard fruits, and a sherry presence. The tiniest hint of smoke, most likely barrel char.

Finish: Medium/short. Gingery spices and a light touch of chilli. Fades out sweet.

Not much to say, really. Drinkable, but not notable. A vatted malt, so more body than the earlier whiskies in the tasting evening and the first one to be free of the ""buzz"" of grain whisky.  Good in comparison to the lesser grain whiskies, but outclassed by the later malts. Above average overall, but I wouldn't bother to buy it.

""Above Average"" : 3 stars"

The palate is very balanced and lightweight, almost like a smoked sake. Some of those dry fruit sherry notes show up with some slight citrus. It then moves towards a sweet cherry then finishing off with a bit of a black tea or coffee finish. Not a whole lot going on here but definitely not a one trick pony!

4.0,"Delicious and yet not really essential at all: smells of honey and heather and vanilla, some cut green grass; white oak and green apples. Floral with a light smoky backbone.  A taste that's light and yet quite hot at the same time. Some sweet caramelized wood char, candied apple, honeycomb and heather, clean smoke (if that makes sense). Pear or apple, but not tipping over too sweetly. A woody, clean smoky finish that's short: there and gone. I bought this bottle to celebrate, and it really served its purpose: unique and clean and crisp and nice, enjoyable even for those who aren't crazy about whisky. But it's also not truly remarkable, and there's a lot of other whiskies out there that fill a similar purpose--many of which, given the current craze for Japanese whisky, are much cheaper and more readily available."
3.0,Feel like they could be variations from the ones I tried in Australia vs the ones in Japan and must say they’re nonetheless still good with the ones in Japan tasting with honey cream and supple - very good 4* while the aussie ones felt like a 3 when compared to the taketsuru 12

P: Fruity and peat reverse with the Sherry taking over, though peat remains and recovers on the mid to back palate become leathery and fruity

F: leathery with tobacco and fruity, fairly smooth, long length...mostly bc peat never dies, haha.

Overall good scotch. Definitely more restrained than Nikka SFTB. Reminds me of Lagavulin 8 but less fruity and herbal. Very dark color. 

Not bad but can see why many may see it as the ugly step child of Nikkas core. The Coffeey grain and Malt have the complexity this lacks. Would buy for novice scotch drinker, but probably not for self. Would spend the extra on the Coffey line or their Single malts."

4.25,"Nose: Creamy vanilla, salted caramel, honeydew melon, apricots, light wafts of cured meats.

Palate: The sherry is what strikes me right away, not what I was expecting given its golden hue. Salted pecans, bread pudding, prosciutto-wrapped melon comes to mind with its salty fat and sweet fruit notes from the melon. 

Thoughts: This has been on top of my lists for a while, every time I have it, that feeling is only reinforced. Like the coastal Scotch offerings from Clynelish and Oban with their briny saltiness, and sweet fruit notes. Not at all aggressive with peat but lightly smoked to give you a salivating property that's hard to explain...like a smokehouse but very light. All in this is one of my favorite Japanese Whiskys."

3.25,"The nose instantly smells of honey and candied fruit, with straw and hints of oak and barley sugar. The honey sweetness carries over onto the palate with a rich maltiness that coats the mouth, but is otherwise a little one dimensional.

4.25,"Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt is a blended malt containing a high percentage from Miyagikyo, with the remainder coming from Yoichi.  Aged on average for around 10 YR in different casks, including sherry.  Very clean on the nose with fruit and light malt.  Rich, fruity, and slight spice on the palate, with a generous and pleasing finish.  There is a richness indicating some sherry wood influence.  An ideal entry point to Nikka Whisky.  My score was 90.  Cheers!!"

What I recall is that there was some malt, some sherry notes, and some honey sweetness.  While I wasn't enamoured, it certainly wasn't offensive.  

That's as much as I recall.  Apparently, It didn't leave much of an impression, so it's fair to say I won't miss it."

3.0,"This is a very interesting Japanese scotch. I typically associate Japanese scotch with light fruity and floral notes but this one NAS Taketsuru goes in a different direction. I get dark umami, light soysauce, toffee notes. I enjoyed it but it is not an everyday drinker for me."

3.5,"While drinking Taketsuru I could have not resist a feeling that I have had already tried it before. And, yes, to my taste there are some definite structural similarities to Mortlach, notably and eminently the 12 y.o., but the Japanese doesn't quite match the Scot's intensity and vigor. This might have been an advantage since I found Mortlach a bit insolent in a way, but here it seems to be a weak point cause it lacks a certain character.
The aroma is very well balanced and nice, really sweet, rum-alike, peaty, with notes of brown cane sugar, honey nut treat (shout outs to Skyrim), candied berries, caramel, red fruits, dulce de leche, molasses, maple syrup and milk chocolate.
The taste is spiced, savoury, a bit spirituous, with nuts and brown sugar again; also some raisins, dates, peaches and figs appear through the tasting, though the general structure stays a bit thin and watery yet viscous enough.
The finish is spicy like a hot chili sauce, really malty, with tones of walnuts and almonds.
I can't really call this one a disappointment (despite paying a hell of a price for such a youngster), but I must admit that my expectations do not match the reality I face.
I really liked the label, and the bottle and its contents, but since it is a gift from my ex-girlfriend (though she was an actual gf when presenting it) and that makes me feel kinda uncomfortable I wouldn't consider giving this whisky any extra points. (This sounds obviously subjective and even lame but, to make it clear, I just use this moot excuse to justify my score)."

3.5,"So delicious, so different to what I know, so sweet, so balanced, so rich and deep, lots of caramel and a bid of smoke from the toasted barrels, fresh whipped cream, lots of floral aromas (blossoming orchard trees). 

You have to try a Nikka like this. It really is something else. This one here is a blend so I guess you get similar notes from other Nikkas as well. It also isn’t expensive but as far as I know it is discontinued - so grab a bottle now if you can. You won’t regret it. 

My 500 ml bottle has maybe 10% content remaining and I must say it really improved over time for me. 

If there would be a peated version of this it would probably easily go over 4.0 ... this one as it is a solid 3,5 in my rating span. 

Some interesting off-notes is tomato and medium cooked breakfast egg that is cut open. Unusual but a somewhat interesting addition to the palette."

4.25,"My third japanese whisky, as the two before, it is very interesting and a good dram. 

Bottled at 43%abv, russet color.

On the nose is quite complex, changing, interesting, with notes i did not found in whiskies before. Citrus notes are the first to appear, prunes, oranges, lemon, tangerine. At the same time coming and going you will find sweet notes and powder like notes like cocoa powder (formula) milk powder (formula) and nutmeg. Very interesting, maybe not that interesting. 

On the palate, it is more straightforward, powerful, not my prefered profile but i recognize it as a good dram. It is way to spicy. Is like a burst of black pepper you did not expect, and it punches you. The second sip you know and you are prepared for it. Oily, a little hot. Full thick bodied, very spicy. The after taste is full and spicy as well but there is milk chocolate in the back as a ""deaf"" flavor. 

The dram is good. Great really, without changing my life or anything. 85 out of 100. 4.25/5."
