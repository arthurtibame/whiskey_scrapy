2.5,"Nose: Dried fruit and cereal aromas, sherry, vanilla, and a little oak.

Palate: A sweet and pleasant entry, soft and rounded with a good texture. Some malty notes appear in the development.

Finish: Short. Sweet and winey/malty aftertaste.

This is the second miniature in the 3-pack of budget Glen Marnoch single malt whiskies I bought today (see the Bourbon Cask Finish for a review the first).

The nose is very similar to the previous whisky, except with a more winey note and less vanilla (as expected). Again it is a simple nose without much going on, but what is there is crisp and fresh.

The palate, however, has greater depth than the bourbon finish expression, with more raisin and grape notes and a little milk chocolate note, but very little spice. Once again there is nothing in particular that you can point at and criticize about this whisky - no unexpected intrusive notes or obvious faults. It's just very young and lightweight but it still represents reasonable value.

""Average"" : 2.5 stars."
