3.25,"Nose: fruity
Palette: Madeira for sure"
4.75,"This is a delicious whiskey. The Madeira cask truly delivers the right amount of fruitiness, primarily cherry, fig and pear to a somewhat spicy and hot whiskey. This balance makes it an easy drinker despite the high proof. This wasn’t a cheap whiskey but it’s every bit as good as MWND but more aimed at bourbon vs rye lovers."
2.5,Prav Saraff pick... the Madeira influence manifests strangely... reminds me of a flower that at the same time smells pleasant and funky... like walking past a dogwood. It's very polarizing. Perhaps it'll develop/soften with air time. 1/3/2020
