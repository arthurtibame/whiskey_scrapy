4.0,"Satisfyingly heavy, oily feel in the mouth. Smokey, salty finish. Leaves your mouth tasting of salted caramels."
4.0,"You gotta love the marketing folks at Ardbeg.  This was originally made to commemorate the World Cup last year ( Auri = gold and Verdes = green...the color of Brazil's national team). I'm still trying to link the Brazilian team to Islay whisky----but I'm sure it's beyond me.  The lovely sport of futbol aside, this is actually a really good whisky.  Peat and citrus on the nose, followed by a coffee and chocolate, and ending with a campfire note on the finish.   Given the price tag, I'm sure you're paying more for the marketing machine than the whisky...but price aside, it's a pretty good dram.  On a side note...if I were an Ardbeg marketer linking this to Brazil, I'd probably have it finished in caipirinha casks.  Probably wouldn't make for a good whisky though."

3.0,"I indulged in a pour of Auriverdes at a whiskey bar in Vancouver, and was quite excited since I hadn't seen it anywhere in the States for a while.  It's interesting but not worth the premium over the regular lineup.  The nose had a wine twist to complement some Ardbeg smoke, but it felt like a bit of a cooking wine -- a little more vinegar and tartness.  At times I also picked up a milky note and some hay.  The palate initially was sweet as well, with some orchard fruits,  and the mid- and back palate were dominated by a roar of nice, complex, charred Ardbeg smoke.  The finish has a coffees and cream duo, as the smoke lingers, but there weren't a rush of flavors.  I've found the distillery's special editions are a little hit and miss, but always worth trying.  And its price, however, I'd just opt for a bottle of 10 and a bottle of Uigeadail and have two whiskies I prefer to this one.  It'd be around a 4-star for me if priced at $80 or below, but at $120+ I'll knock it down to 3.5."
3.0,"Nose: sweet notes of vanilla and stewed fruits. 
Palate: initially sweet. Vanilla, honey. The peat follows straight after. Finishes with medicinal herbs"

4.0,"Peat smoke on the nose is, of course, the first thing you encounter. it's got softer tones than many ardbegs. On the palate it's Smokey and rich w Sherried fruit and soft campfire burn, you can also taste the coastal salt. Finish is long with a spicy warmth."

4.0,Ah this whiskey bar is great. To great in fact as in 24 hours I've gone through 14 drams and its a school day. Anyhow to the whiskey. I like this. Much prefer to the 10 and An Oa as none of that lemony flavour I dislike. Black charcoally smoke as Dreaming for Islay mentions. Water actually improved it...in fact I'd say Ardbeg is probably one of the few distillers I add a few drops to their high abv strength stuff and it comes to life. Most drams it just washes the flavour out. I was like yeah this is a 4. Then I read DFIs review and thought what is the price on this. $200USD here...whaaat. I think down to a 3.5 it goes. I can get the uggie or the kelpie for much cheaper and i prefer both

4.25,"Sequestered brine, seaweed, and faint tar notes join ginger cookies, sardines, and fresh lemon zest in a distinctly Ardbeg nose.  The ocean is more evident here than in other releases:  kippers, salmon, saltines, and a bit of kale are in the palate, although not without honeycomb, faint vanilla, and grassy herbs.  The finish comes in with a big campfire smoke, white pepper, and a whiff of mocha.  The finish is medium, without the viscous resiny character of other Ardbegs.  Semisweet and a step down from the peat punch most Ardbeg enthusiasts would expect (although still a peat lover's dram), it's definitely a great sipper.  However, it also represents Ardbeg playing it safe.  Might it have had at least one muscle to flex?"

5.0,Aromas of sweetness and vanilla.  Smooth smoky flavor going down and then finishing with a hint of fruit.  Amazing.
4.0,"I was in the mood for something different and definitely peaty to counter this wet and chilly weather and this one definitely fit the bill! 

This is a limited release from Ardbeg that was released at the start of the 2014 FIFA World Cup (Ardbeg and Soccer I am all in!!) It's really different from any Ardbeg I have had to date, let's dive in:

It enters pretty soft and very fruity for an Ardbeg. Citrus zest, orchard fruits and honey lead with the peat and iodine taking a back seat. Some campfire smoke notes and some slight red fruit notes. Finish is pretty lengthy and a bit sharp. Definitely young peated Whisky in this one! 

All in all it really enjoyable without really being a standout. If you are a fan of Peated Scotch and want something a little different this one fits the bill. 

Cheers All it's almost Friday!"

3.75,"It’s time for a rare, 2014 Feis Ile festival sample from Ardbeg:  Auriverdes.  This release was designed to honor the 2014 Men’s FIFA World Cup in Brazil.  The colors of the Brazilian flag are green and gold and that’s how this whisky is named.  Auri (gold) and verdes (green) also tie-in to the golden color of the whisky and the iconic, green bottle.  The only thing done to the whisky itself is that the end caps of the casks were toasted to impart a more charred flavor into the NAS whisky.  It’s bottled at 49.9% ABV and is NCF with no added colorant.

It’s a deep, golden yellow in the glass with thin, undefined legs and tiny droplets.  The nose is primarily smoked brisket, oak spirals and fire pit smoke.  The secondary flavors are slightly minty, eucalyptus leaves and some lemon zest that’s traditionally associated with Ardbeg.  They aren’t reinventing the wheel with this release at all.

The palate is both campfire smoke and earthy peat and there’s a faint sherry sweetness and vanilla note arriving at mid sip.  The youthful spirit powers the backend, while being oily and warming.  The mouthfeel is on the lighter side and turns dry towards the finish.  Speaking of finish, it’s medium length with a very light sweetness and smoke.  Earthy minerals linger and turn the final bits a tad bitter and harsh.  It doesn’t turn the experience bad, but it also doesn’t help matters either.

As a festival release, I was slightly disappointed.  There no real experimentation going on here.  Bottles have all but disappeared from store shelves and you’ll have to head to an auction site to find one now.  Prices have remained steady with this one- $80-100 a bottle should win you one, but I’m not sure it’s worth that price, honestly.  Stick with the 10yo or the An Oa for $20-30 less.  Thanks to my buddy @Telex, from Maryland, for this sample pour.  I have a couple bottles of this, as I’ve put together a few Ardbeg Feis Ile sets, but I see no reason to open them.  They are moderately collectible, so that’s how I’ll keep them.  3.5-3.75 stars.  Cheers."

4.0,"Thanks to @Telex for sending over a generous pour of this beauty.  

This is an Ardbeg from 5 yrs ago, marketed during the FIFA Men’s World Cup in Brazil.  Hence the name “Aurivedes”, which means gold and blue.  Now what Whisky and the World Cup have in common, who knows? Just a well timed marketing opportunity.  With that said, now that I think of it, really pisses me off that not a single distillery bothered marketing anything for the Women’s World Cup...at least would’ve been a good opportunity to have an American craft distillery use Alex Morgan, Rose Lavelle or Meghan Rapinoe.  Where was the Swedish distillery Smogen showcasing their pride?  And the Dutch distillery Millstone leveraging Danielle van de Donk, the amazing midfielder? Anyway...I’m off my soap box and now to the business at hand:

This is an Ardbeg.  It’s good.  Enough said.  It’s young, overly expensive, and damn freakin’ good with sweet tar, smoked herring, and lemon zest.  But with that said, would I buy this over their 10, Uigi, or Corey?  Nope.  I firmly believe that with Ardbeg, their core lineup is so damn good that there’s really no reason to fall for their one off marketing gimmicks ( which result in good Whisky, just not better than the core).  Leave the annual Ardbeg Day releases to the lunatics that scour the Internet looking for it.  Leave the Feis Ile bottlings to the ultra-faithful.  The real pot of gold is in their very much affordable, easily available, and amazing core lineup.  

Thanks @Telex...another good Ardbeg."
