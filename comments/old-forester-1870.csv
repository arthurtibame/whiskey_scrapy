3.0,"I've been searching years for old Forrester birthday bourbon.  I've never been able to find it. This is one of two special release old Forrester during 2015.
    
    I'm told by those in the know both these releases are better than the 2015 birthday bourbon. I tried it I like it it's rather inexpensive. And it certainly is a step up from their regular 90 or 100  proof versions"

However, if watering down heavily to equal proof (at least without distilled water) than I prefer the 1870. This is one of the few bourbons with tropical fruit on the palette, which I excellent as I love anything Coconut."

4.0,"Time for a stroll down Whiskey Row! The first of the three WR bottlings from Old Forester is the 1870 Original Batch. While there's still some of that signature OF spicy rye and cherry, there is a lot more of a sweet and fruity quality here. Buttered sweet corn, peaches, vanilla, caramel, cinnamon, and woody oak all come out to play, with a hint of some mint in the background. It finishes up a bit dry and short, but there's a little lingering wood and spice after everything else fades away. I'll bet this makes one honey of a mint julep. A nice, solid dram."

2.0,Very heavy oak flavors and a lot of alcohol burn. Didn’t get any of the vanilla or fruit flavors other people mentioned. Not my style of bourbon at all.
4.25,"This was a very pleasant surprise, well balanced right after opening, which not all bourbons seem to be. It was sweeter than expected with less burn at end. I believe all the data for this that Distiller has is spot on. However, pause for effect.... no way does 
the 86 proof beat this like it shows in the ratings in this app. NO WAY. This has a chance to be my everyday at the end of my 
bourbon journey. Would give it 3.6 if I could, come on Distiller.... add halves please. 
10 months later and a 2nd go round with another bottle. Same as before, but it is better this time. After trying many other bourbons this is hands down on of my favorite pours. I like the sweet taste. Great work OF!"

4.0,"Sample:  Neat in glen cairn glass

Appearance: (4.0)  Really nice reddish to amber hue.  Some legs.

Nose (3.0):  Bit of nail polish aroma which was a distraction followed with some vanilla and oak.

Palate:  (4.0):  Medium oaky with some baked apples and cinnamon.  Bit of spiciness but nothing overwhelming.  Vanilla intensifies from the nose.  A favorable palate.

Finish (3.75):  Quicker finish with a nice warming to it.  A bit of mint and a dash of pepperiness with woodsy character.  Very drinkable.  I liked the finish although I might have liked it to be a little longer 

I would definately buy again.  A nice compliment to Whiskey Row Collection.  I like 1920 a tad better."

3.75,"Im a big OF fan. The 1920, 1897 and Sig100 are elite bourbons imo. This is a lower proof take on the formula paying homage to heritage with the barrel blending. Poured neat, nose is fantastic. Candy apple, cherry pie with the dough latticed over the top, caramel and seasoned oak. Has the trademark varnish note I enjoy. Palate is heavy dose of nose traits plus some rye spice kick without the extra heat and drama of the higher proof making it more accessible. Experienced bourbon drinkers can still get onboard as the flavors are robust, deep and very satisfying. Great balance between the sweet dark fruity caramels and oak, even a little bit of chocolate sneaks in. Finish is traditional dying oak and cinnamon with fruity overtones that linger. I like the massive delivery of cask strength bourbons but this at 90 pf hits a sweet spot. I feel its a bit overpriced ( 38$ at Total wine) but enjoyable enough I might buy again.  Im a total OF fanboy so take that into account............89/100........lotsa yummy flavor with robust oak and sooooo easy to drink.....Think of Woodford with more barrel pop"
