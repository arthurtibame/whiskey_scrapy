4.5,"There isn't much scent. It's alcohol, tartness, and a little vanilla. So, bourbon I guess. There's some red fruity sweetness like apples mixed with strawberries and maybe a little plum. The flavor is very fruity. It's just bursting with strawberry, cherry, and plum. It's obscenely refreshing without tasting like gross cherry. What on Earth is this? Beyond the fruitiness, there is a bit of orange blossom and plenty of vanilla. There is some harshness here from the alcohol, but although there is some ginger, the spice is not overwhelming. This is a really unique bourbon. It reminds me of Knob Creek Single Barrel, but it kicks the fruitiness up a notch. There is some wood that has a bit of bitter coffee to it. The flavor is a bit more bitter than. I would like, but it's still good. There are minerals that come with some hints of honey that add complexity and make this an interesting variation on the usual bourbon formula. Especially at this proof, it's surprising that this bourbon is not terribly aggressive. I like that the spices step back and let the other flavors talk. There might be a little caramel, but its understated and plays well with the honey. The finish is a nice balance of rich and sweet and the spiciness that is present prevents this whiskey from tasting too mild. The orange blossoms blend with apricot in a beautiful manner. There are no bad notes in here and there are lots of good ones. This is a remarkable success. It's a wholey different bourbon, but it is a great one. There's some tartness and mineral, but it isn't too bad. With the toffee elements, there's a surprising amount of malty character in here, but it fades to corn in moderate order. The balance is impressive, but the distinctness of the flavors is more so. With 9 grains, it's amazing that this tastes like anything other than mush. This is a triumph of distilling. There is so much going on here and the flavors are so good, often achieving greatness.
The nose is robust with some varied fruit, sort of like Cognac is playing games. There's a woody element that's rich in the background. Spice, vanilla, caramel: this nose has a lot going on and it varies constantly! The palate is likewise very interesting. This is a huge refinement on the Corsair Quinoa that is super interesting with tons of subtle layers of fruit that don't make it taste excessively sweet and blend terrifically with the rich woody backing. This isn't the richest and heartiest bourbon, but it's delicious like a rich XO Cognac mixed with bourbon. I just can't get over all of the layers here. There's a ton of fruit and some spice and a hint of rye, but there's still some really nice wood and spice with a sweet coating of vanilla. The balance is somehow impeccable and it's truly delightful. Corsair has really nailed it with the bourbon, innovating and pushing the boundaries of what a bourbon can be while balancing numerous layers of very good flavor. This is a really special bourbon. I'd like it to be a little richer, but it really is rich and the flavors fit well together. It compares favorably with Wild Turkey Whiskey Jewbillee. It's actually pretty floral at points, but not in that gross, bitter Irish whiskey way.
The nose is a delight just to smell on its own. It has all sorts of rich, fruity, earthy, complex character to it. The palate is delightful as well with awesome complexity. There's a maltiness that blends excellently with the prominent rich earthy vegetal oiliness of the buckwheat blending with a hint of quinoa earthy dirt. The corn sweetness forms a clear foundation while some rye minerality lightens the drink without making it seem watery or uncomplex and blends nicely with that hint of spelt bitterness and tartness. There is some delicious apricot flavor that is fairly floral and blends well with the bits of vanilla and juicy cherry from the quinoa. Some of that more savory, vegetal, sweet, herbal, rough side of the rye comes out too at times, giving the bourbon a fuller character. It has a fair amount of spice, which does unfortunately make it seem a little bit harsh both because of its proof and somewhat light mineral flavor and because the cinnamon is lighter and has less of that sweet corn flavor than is usual for a bourbon, really giving the ginger and allspice the center stage and letting a little bit of clove in too. This is a terrific bourbon overall and it's amazing that I can pick out the corn, rye, barley, buckwheat, quinoa, and spelt. I have no idea what triticale tastes like and wheat is always hard to taste, so it may be to blame for some of the lightness and minerality. I have no idea why I can't taste the oats though. Still, being able to actually pick out 6 grains in a 9 grain bourbon suggests expert distilling and blending. This is well worth stocking (if you can still find a bottle). It isn't perfect because of the minerality, lightness and spice imbalance, and it certainly is something that should only be tasted with a clean palate, but it's still excellent. I currently have it at a 21 and I don't think it's a 22. It's definitely a 19 though and I think most likely at least a 20. I'll leave it at 21 for now."
