3.0,"Who would have thought that they distill whisky on La Palma? Mostly a rum producer, Destilerías Aldea named this blend after the Canarian dragon tree. A bit peculiar and flat, the nose offers hints of sour cream, green apples and grapes. Leafy bitterness and whiffs of old engine oil emerge. The arrival is oily, fruity and quite aromatic, followed by light peat smoke, Aloe vera and strange herbal notes in the development. Lemon zest, mild sourness and a dash of oak characterize the short but flawless finish. At 22 € per bottle, Drago is certainly a bargain.
