3.0,"This special Tennessee whiskey is a bronze color with thin semi-oily legs.

The nose is very fruity with notes of rosé wine, cider, orchard fruit, grape skins, floral honey, sourdough bread, vanilla, and ethanol.

The palate is light and fruity and has a watery mouthfeel with notes of apple, green grapes, banana bread, milk chocolate, and tannic oak.

The finish is mild, fruity and long, fading slowly.

This was a fun taste of experimentation within the Jack Daniel’s distillery. It wasn’t the best whiskey ever, but it was enjoyable and a fruitier expression of the standard whiskey. Thanks Jack! Cheers!"

3.0,"Smooth, strong hints of walnut."
3.25,"The Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Tasters’ Selection is a series of limited release (24,000 bottles), experimental whiskeys. Each bottling is sold exclusively at the distillery and also in select Tennessee liquor stores. 
Reunion Barrel is Jack aged in barrels that were first used to age Jack Daniel’s, then used for a Tennessee-produced wine, and returned to the Jack Daniel Distillery to finish. Selected by Master Distiller and Master Taster Jeff Arnett.
The nose smells of wine, vanilla and butterscotch. The palate is a significant departure from Old Number 7 and is sweet and tastes of cookie dough with a hint of barrel char. The red wine returns in the finish along with wood. While the taste is a distinct departure from Jack’s flagship whiskey, Reunion Barrel is a bit overpriced and not as unique of a taste as the price suggests."

3.5,"Little spicier than Old No 7. Hints of oak, vanilla, cinnamon. Not bad but not worth the price."
