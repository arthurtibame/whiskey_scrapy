3.75,"This is a different whiskey. The nose is rich, thick fruits. Plum, cherry, fig with a bit of something cooked and dark. The palate starts thick and spicy but quickly dries right out. Rye spice. The finish is even more drying. Oak, but sun-bleached driftwood oak. Then, as I'm thinking, chocolate and roast malt come back. Try as I might, I can't find them in the palate but they are strong in the long finish. A very different dram. I think it will be a love/hate bottle."
3.5,"It’s different that is for sure.  I am also leery of bourbons outside of KY (I know, I know).  The nose is really nice, sweet with a hint of floral.  The first taste is a bit spicy - almost rye-like.  Smooth and not much of a finish.  Bloomed it loses its character."
3.5,Sweet on the nose. Smells like Sherry and honey. Sweet and nice Sherry tastes a bit of plums. A bourbon for sure and a bit of a cabbage after taste. Smooth
