4.25,Very good flavor worth the money !! Lots of heat!
5.0,"This might be my favorite bottle I've tried this year.

This is the fourth bottling (Batch 4 if you will) of the Dovetail. Coming in at 125.24 Proof, this is really an amazing whiskey.  The rich rum and fruity Port wine really shine through, and the finish has that characteristic mint that was present in the first bottling. Despite the high ABV, this doesn't drink hot. 

Dangerous, decadent, delicious."
