3.0,I know whisky is distilled beer but Glen Grant 10 really tastes like it. Sometimes that's what you're in the mood for but most of the time it's not quite complex enough for me.

Did manage to take a sip, and just as I thought...overly sweet with that manufactured corn syrup flavor.

3.0,"Older, independently bottled Glen Grants can be of exceptional quality after having slept in oak barrels for a few decades. This 10-year-old expression, however, is a very simple and undemanding Speyside Single Malt. The aroma is understated, sweet and fruity with hints of pears, nuts and fresh hay. Spicy, young and spirity in the arrival, there are notes of lemon juice, red currants and honey before dry refill cask bitterness takes over. Wood tannins and faint vanilla characterize the rather short finish. A cheap beginners whisky without any complexity.

RATING: 3.0/5.0 stars ≙ 79 pts → AVERAGE"
3.0,"The nose is weak, but there are wafts of apples/pears with a touch of honey. The apples are more prominent on the palate, with a pleasant spice so that is all reminiscent of apple pie. The finish is slightly bitter and short, but I suppose it's forgivable. Not bad."

3.0,"Nose: Vanilla, honeysuckle, pear, orange, almond, hazelnut, malt.

Palate: Sweet malty arrival. A slight herbal note almost like an ale as it develops. Vanilla and fruit. Definite nutty flavours - cashews, hazelnuts. Reasonable texture.

Finish: Medium. Sweet malt and spicy toffee notes.

I'd argue that this is one of the better affordable drams. At the price it is good value, however for a few dollars more you can get the 12 year old, which is better all round.  Likewise, for a few dollars less you can get the Major’s Reserve, which is priced to compete with middle-shelf blended scotch and, although hardly a complex malt, is excellent value.

A very easy, straightforward dram and a great choice for a complete beginner who wants something very friendly and unchallenging. Similar in some respects to Glen Moray Elgin Classic, but that is sweetly fruity whereas this is solidly about warm, sweet malt.

3.75,"I just opened this one to replace the now gone Aberfeldy 12 as the light and cheap whisky from my rotation.

The nose is lovely with ripe pear, floral sweetness and a hint of lemon citrus in the background.

The taste is sweet and reminds me of caramel and honeysuckle. There is no alcohol burn at all.

The finish is also sweet and carry a little bit of spiceness and a tad more bitterness than I would like, but nothing that would ruin it.

Although I don’t agree with it, I don’t think that Jim Murray was completely out of his mind when he called this one Single Malt Scotch of the year 2017 (10 yrs & under). 

This is a lovely whisky with an unbelievable low price tag and certainly is a must buy for fans of floral/sweet speysiders."

2.0,"You can tell it's going to be young from the first sniff. Faint pears, vanilla, straw, hay, cinnamon and sugarcane. Thin mouthfeel, but 40% ABV, so not surprising. The palate is a little better, with white grapes, pears, and your other typical vanilla, woody notes flavors etc. Decent 10 year, but a short and dry white pepper finish to me. It needs some smoke, peat, or sherry... something else. 2.75 for me. Thanks for the taste though @Generously_Paul. The theme of this dram needs to be a bit of a boring song. I am thinking ""Tom Dooley"" by the Kingston Trio. LOL."

2.0,"Another sample from our Scotch Distillery samples tour.  Glen Grant, not a rarity, but nothing I have experienced yet, until tonight. 

There are faint aromas, almost diluted.  Oak, white pepper, apples and hay.  Some earthiness, like a dry and dusty backroad.  A grapiness gradually works it way through over time along with some banana and honey sweetness. 

The palate is light, diluted and sweet.  Just four adjectives: Honey, vanilla, oak, ginger. 

The finish is short, woody and dry. 

This is a rather drab expression.  Diluted was the underlying current from nose to finish.  No zing, flash, pizazz or flavor.  It could, however, be a satisfactory summer sipper.  Thanks @Generously_Paul for the sample. [83/100][Tasted: 6/22/18]"

2.0,"It’s time for another distillery tour sample as we work our way towards the finish line later this summer.  This pour was given to me by my friend @Generously_Paul.  Glen Grant 10.  This offering from another Speyside distillery clocks in at the minimum 40% ABV and is a beautiful yellow gold in the tasting glass.  It looks pretty oily, but reveals big droplets around the rim of the glass with some very thick legs.  Obviously, there’s lots of water in this one.

The nose was extremely weak- even given some significant time to develop.  Weak oak notes and a hint of sweetness that faded after 10 minutes.  There was nothing else discernible no matter how long I kept my nose in it.  Very boring.

The palate and finish didn’t really amount to much, either.  Some weird corn notes and more faint oak.  The finish was short and dry and really was gone in a flash.  This thing needs some serious ABV punch, I don’t know why it was watered down to 40%.  

Overall, this one is very uninspiring and weak.  I’ve heard good things about the older bottles, but this offering doesn’t inspire me to put down the money to find out.  2.25-2.5 stars.  Keep moving, nothing to see here.  Cheers."

3.0,"Stop number 92 on the SDT is Glen Grant. Originally founded by the Grant brothers John and James in 1840, this Speyside distillery has gone through a few different owners including Chivas Brothers. In 2005 it was sold to the Italian company Campari Group and is now the best selling single malt scotch in Italy. Glen Grant has a respectable output of 5.9 million liters per year. This 10 year old single malt is their youngest of their core range that includes a 12 and 18. I don’t know if they have any NAS releases. Bottled at 40% ABV and is chill filtered and has colorant added making it a pale straw. 

The nose starts with hay and dry grasses and some fruitiness in the form of apples and green grapes. There is a balanced, bourbony oak and a nuttiness in the form of walnuts, pecans and cashews. Minty, salty, earthy and a bit gravely/dusty. Malty/barley sugar with some honey and ginger. Light coconut and honeydew. A bit of banana and a lemony-orange citrus. Light vanilla and floral notes like potpourri. There are plenty of notes to pick up on here, but they are all weak. It’s clear that refill casks were used.

Very little going on with the palate. Malty, honey, tea and some vanilla. A little peppery spice and some cinnamon. Oak, ginger, citrus and almonds. 

A light bodied mouthfeel that is thin but mouthwatering. 
A short finish with tea, oak, ginger and almonds.  

Nothing much going on with this one. The nose has some decent complexity, but it, along with the palate, falls flat and is quite uninspired. Even at the $40 price point that I paid, there are far better options out there. I wish I had ponied up the extra $10 and gone with the 12 year old. Oh well, another one off the list. 2.5-2.75 rounded up to a 3
Cheers"

2.75,"Honey-lemon tea on the nose.  The body is possibly the lightest scotch I've ever had.  The palate starts off with cereal grains forward, then with honey sweetness as a finish, mingling with oak spice. The honey character does take a second or third sip to discern, but there's nothing here that's offensive.  As a component of the Chivas Regal blend, I gather this is used to smooth it out.  Still, very drinkable but making very little ripple in the pond.
