3.0,"Decided to go with another bourbon tonight. This review comes from a sample by way of @pollywollydoodle I’ve never heard of Backbone Bourbon before, but to be fair there are a lot of bourbons I’ve never heard of. Apparently this is a product of MGP in Indiana that was bottled in Kentucky. The standard bottling is at 58.2% ABV, but this was from a single barrel pick that was bottled at 57.3%. Natural color of dark copper and I’m fairly confident that its non chill filtered. Barreled in May of 2012 and bottled in November of 2017. 

The nose is predominantly oaky and dry grass with lots of cinnamon and cloves. Plenty of vanilla. No real bite to it considering the high ABV. A touch of mint and a very light dill note. A bit of cherry and tobacco as well. 
With water there is more oak, corn and rye with light brown sugar. 

A VERY big, hot, spicy arrival. The ABV really hits you and wakes up your senses. A huge charred oak profile, pepper, cinnamon, tobacco and leather. I couldn’t get much more because my tongue was on fire. 
Water made the heat much more manageable, but didn’t do much in the way of allowing more flavors to come through. Still very oaky with some caramel. 

A medium to full bodied mouthfeel that is hot and mouthwatering. 
The finish is long, heat, strong oak, cloves and leather. 

This is either lacking in depth or it’s so powerful that you just can’t get anything out of it...or both. Just too hot for my liking. Not enough nuances and I just couldn’t enjoy it from the heat. Thanks for the sample John, it really woke me up this afternoon. 
Cheers"
3.0,"Simple but good, a little harsh on the finish, but then again it is called 'uncut.'"

3.0,"Smells like... MGP. Tastes like... young MGP. Not as complex as other MGP juice I've had, and the bitter notes take precedence. The base is there. This feels like it'll develop. Finish especially is good. 8/17/18"
null,Rated very high on whiskey advocate batch 15.  59$

3.0,"Batch 21, 114.8 proof. 5 YO. Pretty spicy from the rye, but not bad burn. Vanilla and tobacco flavors are strong to me. Like a better version of Larceny. Medium finish."
4.25,"This particular bottle is Batch 18 at 118.3 proof which is 6 years and 3 months old.

The nose has rye, plumb, raisins, dusty milk chocolate, saw dust, and vanilla. It burns the nostrils a lightly, but not in the same deep nostril burn was as other high proofs.

The palate has a nice and oily texture with rye, dark fruit, chocolate and some vanilla and the same dusty characteristics from the nose.
It only slightly dries the palate, which I normally get more of at this proof. But the longer you keep it in your mouth, the drying effect goes up.

The finish has a nice burn at the top of the throat that lingers with rye. The dust follows through here as well, with an overall medium-long to long finish.

I had heard good things about this bottle, so the first time I saw one I had to have it. I’d say it’s unique and I like it, but only time will tell what I really feel about it."
