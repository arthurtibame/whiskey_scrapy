4.0,"On the nose, you get predominantly bourbon characteristics from aging: cedary, slightly charred wood. This is followed by whole leaf mint and muddled parsley. The palate is creamy and sweet. Think snickerdoodles followed by grapefruit, orange zest, Granny Smith apples, and pear. Finishes full circle with black pepper and oak. Savory, sweet, and a good all around sipper!"
