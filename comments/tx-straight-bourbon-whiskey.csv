2.0,This was lackluster and severely dissapointing after waiting outside the distillery! If from Texas atleast try Witherspoon it's a much superior bourbon and about the same price

1.0,Smells and tastes the way an old boot store smells.  I got very few pleasant vanilla or brown sugar notes due to the boot smell being so overwhelming.  Easily the worst bourbon I've tasted (I've had 70-80 thus far.) Hopefully the distillery gets it together and improves with time.  For $50 you can get much nicer bourbon.

3.0,"Nuts, mud, and leather boots— this is definitely a true Fort Worth creation! While I don’t love the nose, it’s decent on the palate and the finish is extremely smooth. Retails for $50, and comes in a very nice bottle so it’s great to give as a gift."

3.0,Decent. Kinda pricey for what it is. So it’s very fitting being from Fort Worth.

2.0,"Reminds me of growing up, the smell is of a tack room in the horse barn. Lots of leather, hay and dirt. Although it’s pleasant memories with those smells, it’s not something I think is good for a drink. Fitting that it’s from Fort Worth, it’s very “Texas smelling”. The flavor is not as reminiscent of the aforementioned barn, but not something I would write home to mom about. It’s rich, just not significant to me. Mouth feel is nice, and fades pleasantly."

4.0,Was just down at the distillery in Ft. Worth and tried the bourbon and the blend. I’ve had a chance to taste some of the first bottles now too and I️ promise it’s worth trying again when your liquor store’s stock cycles through (December ‘17?). They’ve got it dialed in. If you like Old Forrester or other slightly sweet bourbons you’ll like this!

Very warming vanilla, and sweet, smooth all the way through. A very easy drinker, and even easier to love. TX did something right!"

2.5,"To be honest, this bourbon is a bit of a disappointment. At four years of age out of Texas, I expected more flavor and to be honest, better flavor. There is a weird celery note that is pervasive in the middle and finish that I can't get over. Maybe it comes from they're pecan yeast? Not sure, but it's definitely not normal. Is it as awful as lots of the reviews indicate - no. But, it is not something to be sought out - way better Texas whiskeys out there."

3.0,"The nose is filled with grain and malt. The taste is sweet with corn on the front and moves towards a nutty and grainy. It is oily on the tongue with a long finish. 

It is definitely for those in a specific mood for a particularly woody flavoring. Overall, good if you are looking for something different. It is easy to drink, but not a daily drinker because of the unique flavor profile."

3.0,"Not a fan. It’s musty. I’m trying to think of a better description, but I taste a weird mustiness with dust from the corn and spice with vanilla. It’s interesting but not sure I’d drink it again. On the nose, there’s vanilla with dark fruit which I enjoyed. The palate was not as enjoyable. I would love to know how much this pecan yeast affects the taste. If someone were to ask me what’s a good example of a Texas Whiskey, I wouldn’t give them this. I’d reach for a Balcones, Ironroot, or Garrison instead"

Kentucky bourbon it’s not, but it’s not trying to be Kentucky bourbon. Texas whiskey is bold and in your face. This is that."
