4.5,"Sweet, with vanilla notes. Smoky finish. Smoother than the 10 year, quite a bit sweeter. Perceptible bourbon influences present"

4.5,"""Oily mouthfeel. Smoke and peat predominate on initial taste, and give way to a peppery sweetness, like a spicy gumdrop. A bit of iodine on the long finish with a bit of fresh blacktop. It’s definitely a Laphroaig!"""
4.25,"Yes this is Laphroaig from note to finish. What makes this whiskey so awesome is that you don't lose the peat smoke's vitality like you do in today's whiskys. Most Islay's the longer the age the more the peat mellows on this whisky however there isn't as much difference. Why? Well, because this is OLD Laphroaig not today's Laphroaig. It's like finding a dusty from the 60-80's or Buffalo trace finding old Stitzel/weller juice lying around. This 16 year is the last year of old school distillate before the Suntory/Beam merger that created a more corporate appeal to the masses approach think why Select, Trip. wood and PX cask finishing came to be trying to mask the medicinal notes and smoke. The phenols on this whisky scream Ardbeg. Heavy, dense, earthy (as opposed to normal medicinal) peat smoke, bacon, vanilla, citrus, pear hidden away in the back. Taste is peat smoke, the fruit/pear note, vanilla cream, honey sweetness, lemon and burnt orange citrus and then barrel spice and a touch of char from 16 years locked away showing up. Finish is long with the smoke staying around the longest but no where near the length or strength of a fresh 10 year old. The citrus, barrel notes also linger on with the honey sweetness hanging around faintly in the background. To get some of the last pre merger whisky have it bottled at a really nice 16 year age statement, and not be break the bank expensive at the cost of NAS Lore this is a WIN WIN WIN if you love peaty/smokey Islay scotches."

4.25,"There’s an interesting twist to the latest limited-edition Laphroaig: nothing. No fancy finish, no complicated back story, just a traditional first-fill bourbon cask maturation with a sweet sixteen years in the wood. The last time we saw a 16-year-old from Laphroaig was a very limited half-bottle release for its 200th anniversary in 2015 and comparing my notes for the two suggests a similar recipe. The new version is still available from Amazon in the UK though I count myself lucky to have obtained one from the more limited US retail allocation.

The nose is predominately sweet camphor with creamy undertones, though there’s a hint of lactic acid and lemon. Pine needles in a damp forest also come to mind. In the mouth, it starts sweet, then turns increasingly peppery. The aftertaste begins tangy, then veers into menthol with a hint of sweetness.

It’s a straight-down-the-line Laphroaig, flawless in its representation of the distillery. As I wrote for the previous 16, it’s mellower than the 10 and less challenging than the 18. There are no waves of complexity to the palate nor any great surprises, but there’s nothing wrong with that when it comes to Laphroaig. Sometimes it’s hard to improve on the original."
4.0,"sweet & ashy. burns more than one would think for the proof, but not in a bad way."
4.0,"Very random limited release from Laphroaig, what with the whole Amazon deal in Europe. Luckily, it made it to the shelves here in the U.S., as I'll always jump at the option to try age-stated Laphroaig.

Nose: Many of the standard Laphroaig notes. Seaweed, iodine, smoke, sea salt, bandaid, tennis ball (you were absolutely right on that last one @Generously_Paul ).
Interesting new car leather note. Chestnut. Fruity notes like apple, pear, and apricot. Some vanilla and butterscotch sweetness. Some cinnamon and oak. Much less peat intensity than some of the younger expressions. Solid start.

Palate: Heavy campfire smoke, iodine, sea salt, seaweed, peat. Spicy black bean chili with red and black pepper. Cinnamon spice as well. Some heat here, but not unwelcome. Chestnut, caramel, vanilla, apple, pear, and milk chocolate. Floral and oaky. Interesting combination of sweet and heat, brine, smoke, and medicinal notes. But nothing we haven't seen from Laphroaig in the past. Solid nontheless.

Finish: Still plenty of campfire smoke, iodine, seaweed, sea salt. You can taste the peat and smoke all the way to the end. Black bean chili, cinnamon, and oak spice. Fades away with oak, apple, pear, and vanilla. Moderate/long length.

This is unusually mild for a Laphroaig. Fairly sweet, extremely fruity. Certainly a departure from the bold and brash 10 Y.O. and NAS variants that I love so much.

With that being said, it's not what I want from Laphroaig. My lowest rated expression so far. However, I tend to rate Laphroaig very highly, so with such a high standard, it would be irresponsible to only compare this to those other offerings.

Judged independently, this is quite enjoyable. There is plenty to take in here, and the Laphroaig DNA is palpable. Maybe age is a detractor here? All the notes are present, but the intensity is lacking just a bit. Regardless, this is a great tasting whisky with impressive an impressive age-statement and a respectable ABV. If you're a Laphroaig fan curious to see what an older Laphroaig tastes like without breaking the bank, this one fills that role nicely."

4.25,"Nose- Salted caramel, raspberries, peat smoke, iodine, vanilla 

Palate- Peat smoke initially, iodine, oak, dark chocolate, plum jam, honey

Finish- Long, thin finish with notes of bonfire, peat smoke, and dark chocolate


I’ll start this off by saying im not the biggest Laphroaig fan in the world, but this one is very pleasant. The nose is good, but restrained at the same time. Nice balance of peat, sweetness, and fruits on the nose, but everything seems a little tame and I feel like there could be more. On the palate, peat prevails... with a nice balance of oak, dark chocolate and a plum-jam note that is quite enjoyable. The finish is, again, dominated by iodiny- peat, and wraps up  with the dark chocolate note again."
