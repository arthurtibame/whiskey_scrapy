4.0,First taste while watching Meatballs
3.5,A good bourbon. Love having these guys in the neighborhood with pickup available.
3.0,"Got it for cheap.  Had a lot more flavor than I expected for the price.  Some alcohol burn, but a great neat sip and mixer."

3.0,"Had this awhile back (bought on sale for under $20).  Kind of a fruity bourbon with some distinct floral notes.  Nothing incredibly special for me, but definitely a solid pour.  I wouldn't seek this out specifically, but if I find it for a good value I'll definitely bite again!"

3.0,"Being aged only 4 years, it’s missing the vanilla and tobacco and smoothness that I love about bourbon. It’s ok. Finishes kind of rough. I wouldn’t recommend for extended sipping situations"

3.75,"Modest, toasty, somewhat neutral. A solid Bourbon from the ""other"" Commonwealth."
null,"This is showing to be a little on the shy side. Presents itself a lot like a traditional highland scotch whisky. 51% corn and 49% malt mash bill, and honestly, the barley really stands out. On the nose, orange fruit, corn meal, honeycomb cereal, vanilla cream, buttered English muffin, light brown sugar, ginger, herbal tea, furniture polish, and some interesting grass notes. Palate is actually dominated by barrel spice, given it’s a 4-year, and you’re left with a slight bitterness on the finish. Easy to understand and a nice change up to your Kentucky monsters. Highly likely to be sourced from MGP."
3.5,"Interesting jump at beginning but falls off quickly. That said, a sweet, uncomplicated pleasant dram."
