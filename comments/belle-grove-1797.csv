3.25,"Nose is completely dominated by wood.
Barrel char, tree bark, tobacco and burnt caramel something very herbal.  Maybe the stump of a rosemary or mint bush. A bit of vanilla in there. 
Dry, astringent palate. 
Cedar closet, caramel, more charred wood... a bit of sticky sweetness helps add some dimension."
