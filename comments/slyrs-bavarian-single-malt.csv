3.0,"The medium gold color gives it a typical character of an American oak cask, however shows long legs upon swirling, which indicates a not-so-rich character of the whisky. 
      The nose is slightly warming and only a bit shy, presenting sweet flavours of vanilla and caramel cake. The mouth feel is spirity and has a smooth texture. The palate is quite nutty , slightly sweet with hints of oak in the background. The finish is quite dull, presented with a slight flavor of citrus and toasted nuts. 
      
      Overall verdict: Does quite well for a 3YO German malt whisky."

3.25,"Whisky is now produced all over the world, so let's try Slyrs Classic from Germany. Established in 1999, Slyrs distillery uses primarily new American oak casks to mature their Single Malts. The nose is perfumy and youngish with sweet pastry, vanilla powder and fresh flowers, and there are occasional notes of ginger, apple juice and bubblegum. This malt is not shy! Arriving punchy and aromatic, the taste is quite cask-dominated and slightly spirity with hints of walnuts. Bitter chocolate dominates the simple finish. Oktoberfest with Bavarian whisky? Why not.

1.0,"During a business trip in Germany, the waiter offered me a free sample of their' German Whisky, after a few Scottish Single Malts. Unsurprisingly, due the pale yellow collar,  it taste young quite young and a bit sharp. I tasted some sweet notes, but the finish was a bit bland, and short. Not bad, but might need some extra maturation."

3.0,"Nice flavor from the grains.  A bit young, with a harsh bite for the proof.  Alcohol fumes are strong on the nose.  Will be interesting to see how this progresses with, hopefully, more matured bottlings."
