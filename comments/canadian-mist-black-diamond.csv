2.0,"This whisky has a light copper color and thick watery legs.

The nose is caramel and maple dominant, with some additional notes of baking spices, buttered toast, marshmallow, corn chips, and some chemical astringency.

The palate has an oily mouthfeel, with notes of vanilla, mild spice, robust maple syrup, and a graininess.

The finish is semi hot and lingering.

In my opinion this expression is better than the original, but it is still not excellent. A mixer for a rye based cocktail wouldn’t be bad, but I’d go with something else first. Cheers!"
