4.0,"Nose - Sweet candied ginger/raisin spicy sweet, dark apple juice

Finish - Lingering tingle/heat, apple juice sweet, light golden raisins

Score - 83/100

Final Thoughts - So if I didn't know this was a PX finished Scotch, I wouldn't have thought of that at all. I don't get the dark raisins/syrupy dark stone fruit notes at all in this from the nose to palate to anything. This tastes like a generic sherry finished blended Scotch to me. Nothing off-putting, but nothing that makes it stand out either. Pleasant to drink, but that's about it. You seem to forget about it seconds after you drink it. Easily sippable, but nothing to remember later.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"
