5.0,"Untitled Whiskey No. 13, a 10-year old high rye bourbon rested in a combination of Cognac, Spanish brandy, Amontillado, Oloroso and Pedro Ximenez sherries.
The nose on this whiskey is bright and fresh, reminiscent of expressed grapefruit peel and maple sap. The palate starts with candied orange peel before richer, fruitier notes of blackberry jam and maraschino cherries appear. The finish stays on the tongue long after swallowing with hints of chestnut honey and tiramisu."
