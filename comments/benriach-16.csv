2.0,Very sweet and cashew-y on the nose with a salty flat finish. Not especially memorable but a paletable bar option

3.0,"Some similarities to the 12 year old, but the vanilla is less dominant, the honey is a little more noticeable, there is a little oak, and the fruitiness shows up, to me at least, as tart green apples, at first.  15 minutes in, and the tartness fades to a more sweet red apple, some nuttiness shows up, and the balance between the vanilla and oak is very nice.  There's a little toffee in there at first.  A nice dram."

4.0,"Fruit and honey sweetness on the nose. Vanilla, nuttiness, and some pear on the palate. Creamy, rich, and smooth. Medium to long finish that balances honey sweetness with a touch of char smoke in the background. 91/100."
null,"First sip was not great, not a lot to it in terms of complexity.  Second sip was very smooth, still not a lot of depth but getting better. I can taste caramel. It is smooth and after a few sips has flavour. Not good enough for 16 years but a nice general drop 3 stars today."

3.75,"Nose - Floral golden honey, more balanced white fleshed fruits, light leather, vanilla, light milk chocolate mole.

Taste - Rich creamy mouthfeel, floral golden honey, dark apple/pear juice, caramel, vanilla, smoked almonds, faint wisp of coal/campfire smoke, nutty sweetness

Finish - Lingering gentle warmth, light smoky mole milk chocolate, dark caramel, fruity pear, light fruity bitter

Score - 80/100

Final Thoughts - This one was a bit bitter in terms of overall experience in that it did capture more complex flavors. The added leather/chocolate to the light fruit/honey was nice. I don't think this is peated, but it has this tiny wisp of clean smoke to it, like they didn't completely clean out the stills after a peated run or it was aged next to some extra heavily peated malt. It was subtle and quite nice. No off-putting notes and continues to have the nice creamy mouthfeel.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

4.0,"Fruit (almost like banana) and honey on the nose. Very aromatic. Oak and nuts come through on the tongue.  Soft, gentle finish, made softer with a few drops of water. Very nice to drink"

4.0,"This is a wonderful whisky that will challenge your ability at teasing out aromatic compounds; unfortunately the predominance of ethanol at first nosing masks whatever is underneath. A few drops of water and allowing the dram to decant in a glass for at least 15 minutes goes a long way. That said, the bourbon cask really comes through with wonderful aromas of oak, vanilla and honey. Additionally, subtle touches of apricots and smoke really add depth and character here. And with a mouthfeel that is full and oily, the finish is long and sumptuous. Fantastic!"

3.0,"Initially when i tried I wasn't getting a lot out of this one. I found it a bit 'ethanolly' which masked the flavour profile. Roll on a few days and it opened up a fair bit more. Honey, vanilla, toffee and the alcohol become slightly more balanced. Still the aftertaste is a bit astringent. I rated this initially a 3 on first taste then on the 2nd once opened up a 4 taking into account the price of $60USD and the fact it's spent 16 years in a cask makes it a good value drop. Then on the third tasting months later it seems to have faded a bit and if I look at other 4s like a Laphroig PX, Bunnahabian 18 its not it the same class so back down to 3 it goes. They really need a half star rating system on this site!"

4.0,"Maroon Label

Nose: Red delicious apples, vanilla, light honey, graham crackers, a  little potpourri and a little non-sweet strawberries.

Palate: Vanilla, light honey and red delicious apples are at the front. Then, you get some graininess with graham crackers and light coconut. The strawberries come out a little with a touch of water.

Mouthfeel: Medium, with some oiliness.

Finish: Spicy with cardamom, cinnamon, Szechuan peppercorns, oak tannins, orange pith/bitters. A touch of potpourri. A little bourbon-like cherry.

Overall: Very nice lighter scotch with very good balance and overall construction. Lacks the wow factor to score higher, but this is still a very good creamy/fruity whisky."

3.5,I would have been surprised if I wouldn’t had been surprised. It really was very enjoyable. Like all of BenRiach‘s lineup it has something very unique compared to what I have tasted from other Speyside distilleries. But my preference of peated whiskies made me miss something. I would go for the Curiositas before this one any time.

3.5,"Tasting it neat I get smoke and honey. With water the smoke is diminished, honey and banana taste become stronger."
3.25,"Nose: Sweet, honeyed cereal. Nuts, sweet white grapes and barley sugar. Apricots, orange zest and vanilla emerge over time. Water develops a light peach aroma.

Palate: Sweet but drying on the entry - elegant and austere rather than voluptuous, which the nose might lead you to expect. Cereal and malt in the development which turns from cereal towards woody in the finish. There are, however, many sweet and honeyed fruit notes on the mid-palate with orange oil and vanilla particularly on display. Some tannic spice lunges forward towards the finish but the texture is creamy and full.

Finish: Medium. Sweet and fruity, even crisp in a way. The aftertaste is rather like over-brewed English breakfast tea, but it's nice in context.

The nose is particularly sweet and fragrant - very honeyed and luscious and a particularly good example of a non-sherried full-bodied ""fruity"" nose. The palate is creamy and fruity but with a spicy note that takes over in mid-palate and may seem a little too dominant. I did not notice any particularly smoky aspect to the profile at all - maybe some barrel char, but no reek.

Water reacts oddly here, bringing out both sweet and bitter/spicy notes on the palate. In fact, overall it's a development of sour malty cereal characteristics more than anything else. Interesting, but perhaps a little challenging.  I'd rate this between the 12 year sherry wood and the 10 year old.

Tasted from a 30ml sample.

""Above Average"" : 3.25 stars"
