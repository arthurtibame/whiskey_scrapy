4.0,"Söt sagosoppa med tydligt ""alkoholsting"" slår emot näsan! Lite bitter ek följer med!
Värmer upp rejält till en början och gör inte mycket väsen av sig, lite ek, lite sherrytoner. Välbalanserad men lite trist.
Finishen värmer på ytterligare och mer behaglig bitterhet följer. Kan vara nåt kanderat apelsinskal där. Mycket välbalanserad blend men utan stark karaktär."

4.0,"First off, the Hibiki bottles are a work of art in themselves, and one I have coveted as a display piece for a while. The glass stopper is especially luxurious as, sadly, many japanese whiskies come with metal screwcaps. The color is a deep amber, and the nose is light, floral and with hints of rosemay, and undertones of raisins and candied orange peel. The palette is mainly sweet, but not overwhelmingly so, and nicely balanced with the sizzle of the alcohol. There is a mild and creamy feeling to it, like white chocolate, with subtle notes of orange blossoms and vanilla. The finish is long and with a pleasant mild oakyness. Highly recommended as a dessert dram after ""light"" meals, or to seduce attractive companions."

5.0,"Day 19. Last day of work before christmas and general shit day, so I really needed a good whisky this evening. And I got one. The Master Select seems to be the replacement for the 12 year old (with the normal Harmony being a tier below). Haven't had a chance to try the 12 yet, but what I hear about it is plums. Well, this one got you covered if you like them plums. On the nose, you get a lot of them, together with dried pineapple, all coated in chocolate and with some vanilla in the mix. This continues on the palate. Chocolate, plums, barley, vanilla and some spices to give it some bite are combined into a nice, friendly whisky that just wants it's Senpai to notice it. Well Master's select...you've been noticed. And that looong finish of chocolate covered plums will make sure that you leave a lasting impression. Just what I needed today. And now, off to bed. Have a good night fellas. Cheers."

3.75,"Time to try this travel exclusive before I get to the Hibiki 12! 🥃

This is a blended whisky, 43% ABV. It is drawn from 5 different casks and selected by the Suntory Whisky blending team and released on the travel market 🥃

🌕🌕🌕🌗🌑 NOSE •
Nose offers notes of raisins and otherwise general fresh fruits. I'd also describe it as floral with some lighter notes. Rather faint. Also let it breathe for a bit.

🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑 PALATE •
I found the palate rather delightful with fresh fruits swirling on the tongue, notes of orange. Rather tropical! I picked up some banana and then the oak. Palate has a gentle burn.

🌕🌕🌕🌑🌑 FINISH •
The finish had spice notes for me, mainly pepper with a hint of vanilla. Finish is friendly and short.

🌕🌕🌕🌖🌑 OVERALL •
Overall I enjoyed this more than the ""regular"" Japanese Harmony. Especially the fresh fruit palate. A pleasant blend. I wish the finish was as fruity and fuller like the palate which would take it to new heights. We'll see what the Hibiki 12 has to offer! 🥃"

4.25,Take 2 - such good value at about aud 140 or SGd 120. Ticks all the right boxes and is just so enjoyable. True harmony is the only way to express this. A top Japanese that’s still available that is a crowd pleaser

The Master’s Select steps it’s up a notch with a more floral nose almost like rose peddles and the palate has a stronger sherry influence than the regular harmony. Overall this whisky is delicate and really balanced. I wish it wasn’t just sold in travel retailers and we can have it here in the States in 750 ml bottle!!"

4.5,"This is a travel retail exclusive expression from the traditional and popular hibiki harmony. This is a very different dram than the ""regular"" japanese harmony. Very easy drinkable and delicious. You can take on the whole bottle and not even notice it. The main difference between the two: sherry.

Bottled at 43%abv, tawny color.

On the nose it is a glendronach 12. There is no better way to tell it. Sherry, vanilla custard cream, vanilla cookies (the ones you mash to make a cake). After a couple minutes a citrus note appear, lemon peel  and maybe prunes. 

On the palate it is very appealing and easy, very balanced sherry, oak, almonds, oranges, vanilla and allspice. The aftertaste is medium long and very sweet, with cinnamon and vanilla notes. 

Balance is the name of the game, it is not the greatest dram ever, i was even having trouble in deciding wether to give it a 4.0 or a 4.5, but because of how balanced it is, it managed to score the 90 points to achieve its goal as a very recommendable whisky.  90 /100, nice dram. (But The original japanese harmony is better and cheaper)."
