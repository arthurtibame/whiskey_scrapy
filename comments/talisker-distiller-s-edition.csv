3.5,"84.  Tried this at Reserve 101.  Need to confirm this is the one, but might want this in my collection.  

Update 9/2014 - Opened my bottle.  Only slightly less great than I remembered (but isn't it often that way about things?).  The traditional Talisker peat is still there, with a smoother, sweeter beginning, middle and finish.  If you're struggling with peaty malts, finish a bottle of Distillers Edition and you'll be on track to appreciate the big-boy peats!"

4.0,"Talisker, my first love in the world of single malts. Whereas the 10 year might be down-to-earth, soft spoken, but tried and true, this whisky is romantic, piquant, and emotive. The scent is identical to my first impression of Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier: sweet, malty, and bacon. On the tongue - spiced currants, black pepper, dried cherries, a fair amount of sea salt, and a Romeo y Julieta cigar. Intriguing, astringent mouthfeel. The finish redoubles with browning fruit and campfire smoke, burning with pepper and passion à la Smaug's breath. Full of excitement all the way through."

5.0,"Bottle: DE 2003/2014 45.8% L4266CM000. Glass: Glencairn
                        Nose: Mild peat and alder smoke with sherry and toffee right off.  After a few minutes and two drops of water, fruits and maple syrup emerge with some nice briney salt spray and bacon drippings in the background--maybe some gherkin(?)!  Palate:  Smokiness still there but easing a bit with fruit, maple syrup and leather taking front stage.  Reminds me of the excellent Laphroaig 15y 200th anniversary but with less overt fruit and peat (and no iodine at all).  Some milk chocolate and salt in there too.  Finish:  Long and rich, leather and sweet tobacco with milk chocolate.  It may all sound quite sweet, but there is nothing syrupy or cloying about this at all.  This is an absolutely delicious dram in my opinion--a current favorite! Easy 91/100! MMB 07-06-16"

4.0,"As Memorial closes, and a nice meal of pecan-smoked steak, decided today to finally enjoy this whisky. Smoke, though not overpowering, greets you and the sweet richness of raisins, vanilla, brown sugar and a touch of nougat and chocolate (like a Milky Way).  A rich spiciness opens the palate.  A nuttiness dominates once the spicy notes dissipates other whisps of smoke and brown sugar. As it fades, the Talisker smoke stays with you with a touch oak.  A lovely, sweeter version of the standard; one to lose you thoughts to and escape. [$65][90/100][Opened: 5/29/16]"

I love Johnnie Walker Black Label and Te Bheag, both containing Talisker malt, so I gave this a shot... And it's splendid, luscious, warm and vivacious.

3.0,"I'm in a new, smoky scotch kind of mood tonight so I busted open my Talisker Distiller's Edition from 2014.  It's a precocious pre-teen 11 year old and was ""Double Matured"" in Amoroso sherry casks.  It was bottled at a rather robust 91.6 proof.  It's 3am here on the east coast and my insomnia is daring me to ""bring it"".

On the nose there's a nice stone fruit sweetness that's masking the peaty smoke and brine.  A hint of dark cherry leads into a hit of lively oak barrel.  To a bit of a surprise there's an odd smell that triggers the memories of the cherry NyQuil I was chugging last week as I tried to get over a head cold.

As I take that first sip I get a nice rush of cherries and dark, bitter chocolate.  Before I can really savor it the overwhelming wash of oak and heat from the alcohol rinse all the sweetness away.  Too quickly, I might add.  Dammit.  The sea salt and peat comes on fast and a bit harsh IMO.  This Talisker is really ""in your face"" and out to make a statement, I think.

I guess I expected the DE variation to be a mellow, restrained example of the 10 year old but this really demands all of your senses and attention.  There's not a damn thing wrong with that, but to say I wasn't expecting that is an understatement.  I don't know how to rate this right now so I'm gonna go middle of the road and come back to it when my head is right.  Lol.  Cheers."

4.0,"First tasted at the distillery, and left me longing for more. Long story short, I have a full bottle now to enjoy. Hooray for me. It starts good: beautiful copper color. The nose reminds me of bacon pancakes with maple syrup. It has a pleasant mouthfeel, soft like pine nuts. The taste and finish are very similar to sherried whiskies like Glenfarclas, but with a slightly savory, briny, and smoky twist at the end. The twist is too subtle though; I wish the Talisker pepper and smoke were more apparent, then this whisky would be absolutely gorgeous. Nevertheless, it's a lovely dram that you ought to check out, just not for the reasons you usually check out a Talisker. The music equivalent would be Don't Cry from Guns N' Roses: a surprisingly delicate song that shows the diversity (and therefore skill) of the band."

    This is top notch. The classic Talisker elements are there on the nose - some brine (almost olive-like), a good whiff of peat smoke, a bright vanilla sweetness. On the palate, it's a flavor explosion - a sophisticated dance of sea salt, a savory note (again, I say olive), a light cloud of peat smoke, red and black pepper, a bit of baking spice and a swirl of vanilla. Thick and unctuous, this coats the palate, with sweet smoke and a hint of pepper lingering on. Just absolutely delicious."

3.0,"Finished in Amoroso sherry casks (not Oloroso), this 2014 Distillers Edition weighs in at the typical 45.8% ABV Talisker is know for. The color is honey gold but I do not know if it is natural color or not. Also no word if it is chill filtered. 

The first thing I asked myself when I first nosed this single malt was, is this really Talisker and not Glenfarclas?  Sherried fruits and sherried oak. Nutty with raisins and dates. Bitter orange/grapefruit peel. Incredibly similar to Glenfarclas, but the sherry influence is less intense. Very similar profile but just not as in your face with the sherry.  A light malty character too. There was something else that was different though. It took me a while to figure out what it was and then it hit me. Peat!  Not smoke like that typically found in Talisker, but an earthy peat. It was so covered and muted that I almost missed it, but once I found it there was no losing it. After the level in the glass neared the bottom I was able to get a light maple syrup and cinnamon, like a room temperature French toast. Very odd for Talisker. 

The palate was equally non Talisker like. Semi sweet up front with the typical Talisker pepper creeping in. Fairly mild at first, but it picks up steam the more you drink. Sherried oak and light fruits. The same phenomenon that happened on the nose happened on the palate, the peat just showed up out of nowhere. Again more of an earthy peat and not really any smoke. Very odd indeed. 

A nice oily mouthfeel at first with some spice. Turns dry though. Again, like the Glenfarclas 25, the finish really let me down. Long finish that is quite dry. Some sherry, pepper, light peat, maybe some citrus, but very bitter. The bitterness just hangs around and makes me want to wash it away with water. 

I'm not really sure how to score this one. It's more like a lightly peated Highland/Speyside malt than an Island malt. Again, very un-Talisker in my opinion. I would not seek out a bottle. I would much rather stick with the 10 YO which is a solid whisky at a reasonable price. I do want to thank Lee for sending me the 2oz sample that this review is based on. It's good, don't get me wrong, but not great and not what I want from a Talisker. I would give it a 3.75, but the finish killed it. 3.5"

4.0,"Wood finishing can add an additional layer of complexity to a whisky, but it can also spoil the existing character of the malt. In case of Talisker Distillers Edition (2006/2016), the Amoroso finish is hitting the spot! The nose is delivering restrained bonfire smoke, brine and a lovely note of sweet BBQ sauce. On the palate, the famous 'chili catch' is less punchy as in the original, while the feast continues with salty spare ribs, sweet grapes and bitter hints of European oak. Charcoal, mild pepper and fruity sweetness remain for dessert. A fantastic Single Malt!

4.0,"Not to bad at all. Maybe its because I'm on my 8th whiskey tasting that the slightly harsh notes are dulled or maybe I'm just feeling in a very generous mood but either way I like it. It's missing the lovely mouth feel of the 10 but has a nice bite, sherry, peat, sweetness and black pepper and unfortunately a bit of a bitter finish. This is based on a 200ml bottle and would I buy a whole one. Nope. It's not worth the 25% premium on the 10, the Laga Distillers edition is preferable and the bitterness carries through a bit to much to the aftertaste. High threes round up to a 4.. would be interested to see how oxidation affects it."

4.0,"Virtually all of Diageo's major distilleries offer a ""distillers edition"" or ""distiller's edition,"" which is the base expression from a distillery with some added sherry finish.  That's the formula with Lagavulin Distillers Edition, which is stupidly amazing, and Caol Ila and Oban have similar offerings.  Talisker's Distillers Edition is finished in Amoroso sherry casks for the last few months before bottling, and that short amount of time does impart some significant changes to this single malt.  Compared to Talisker 10, the powerful sherry influence diminishes some of the balance and variety of flavors that the base expression exhibits, and which makes it one of my favorite single malts.  On the nose, I detect cherry, oily sherry, wisps of smoke, marzipan, and a distinct brininess.  The palate is sweet and floral at first, with sherry and malt mixing with brine, a pinch of pepper, and citrus fruits.  Overall, however, that sherry washes out more flavors than it adds, and makes this a less distinctive dram, one that I easily could have mistaken as the product of many Speyside distilleries.  The finish consists of leather and shoe polish, gravel, and apple-flavored malt.  A bottle can be found for about $80, so not much more than the original, but what's the point of the splurge when Talisker 10 is just so good?  Thanks to Telex for the sample!"

5.0,"Nose: sherry, camp smoke, sea salt, pepper, orange and honey. 

Palate: Sherry sweetness followed by orange and sea salt. The whisky heats up with pepper and smokiness. Finish is shorter than I expected, but still satisfying to the last. Honey and orange sweetness linger after the smoke and pepper vanish. Sherry influence is also left on the palate.

Color is darker honey, whisky has a heavier body, though it seems to lighten a bit on the tongue."
5.0,"Color: Dark honey. 

Nose: Dense sherry, smoke, and salt topped of by hints of orange and honey. 

Palate: Sherry, orange, honey and sea salt hit the palate first. And black pepper and smoke take up the rear with lingering citrus and honey. This dram gradually and gracefully  warms up"

5.0,"Talisker Distiller’s Edition satisfies on every level and leaves room for those not accustomed to a bolder, smokier scotch. 

This dram demonstrates ample craftsmanship well within reach, below the price tag of what it deserves.

Upon opening, the nose is met with layers of smoke, peat, stewed meats, pipe tobacco, dried and ripe fruits, carrot cake, baking spices, sweet aromas and sultry vanilla. It was at one moment beauty, and the next, beast, full bodied and rich. 

For the mouth, expect a clean and savory saltiness, with plenty of sweet and very low levels of brine. Each sip is better than the last and you find new reasons to smile as the savory and sweet components complement one another on the tongue.

The finish is warm, that heat later magnified as the dram settles for a lengthy and full bodied exit.

Talisker Distiller’s Edition is a dark horse you can afford to put your chips down on. It gives you a great appreciation for what a 10 year old scotch can be when treated with such care.

    #10: Talisker Distiller’s Edition.  Single Malt Scotch.  45.8% ABV.  D2000/B2011
    Paid $72
    I was lucky enough to get a second 2011 bottling for $76.  I’m afraid I probably won’t see this older vintage again, but it’s not noticeably better than the newer version, which I would be happy to purchase.
    
    We are finally in the top 10!  The Distiller’s Editions of Diageo’s Classic Malts of Scotland have received mixed reviews.  Traditional maturation creates depth and “real” complexity that is diluted when you finish in a second cask.  Finishing creates “engineered” complexity that some experts claim they can sniff or taste out.  I just know Talisker DE takes a great original Talisker 10, and actually improves it by finishing in Amaroso sherry.  The sherry influence has a strong presence, but is well integrated into the traditional Talisker notes of iodine, antiseptic, cloves, (bitter) dried orange peels, and red chilies.  The added sweetness of the sherry creates an oilier, more luxurious mouthfeel that the original 10 lacks.  This 2011 bottling (brown bottle with brown label) may be a tad more medicinal than the current version.

4.0,"2015 Edition

Nose - Light briny smoke, dark apple cider, orange zest, bright red berries, poached pears.

Taste - Light clean smoke, brine, hint of sweet seaweed, apples/pears, thick & oily mouthfeel, orange zest, treacle toffee, nice oaky peppercorn spice.

Finish - Lingering salty smoke, light bitter orange pith, sweet dark almost burnt toffee, oaky peppercorn spice/heat, bitter cocoa nibs.

Score - 83/100

Final Thoughts - This one had a very nice nose, but sadly I didn't get as much fruit on the palate as the nose would lead you to believe. Once it hits the palate though, it's a rush of initial sweet fruit followed by tons of brine/smoke and instead of a more fruity sweet it's more of a dark/burnt sugar bittersweet that transitions to the finish. Maybe I was just looking for a longer fruity sweet on the palate since it was so nice on the nose.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - Maybe, if it was priced around $50-60"
5.0,"A delicious dram, smooth and tasty. Great peat flavor, I hate to use the word voluptuous but it really was.  Had this at the inaugural South Fla Whiskey Society meeting."
4.0,"A wee bit disappointing, since I love Talisker 10 so much. Everything I get from the 10 I get from this actually as well, but the additional sherry influence just somehow,  to me, instead of enhancing it, masking the greatness of the 10 a little.

    It's still something I absolutely appreciate, but if you haven't tried the 10, I'd say try the 10 first.

Full, satisfying nose - not very pronounced. Wind wave, salty, brown sugar, and some kind of dessert sweetness - overall reminds me of Highland Park 12, which in my memory was more pronounced though scattered  - fruity, dried fruit, still, there's some freshness - something in-between - signature Talisker?

Warming, woody spicy golden raisins, dried fruits on the palate - quite fruity and peppery - not that spicy, more just about being peppery. 

Finish is where the smoke and peat coming, big, long and awesome.

It has somehow similar profile to Glen Scotia 15 to me - it's perhaps more accomplished, yet has maybe less personality.

Not that complex, but full, rich and satisfying."

Taste - Sweet fruity salty sea air, lightly smoky like the morning after a bonfire on the beach, light fruity black peppercorn spice, fresh red berry sweet similar to that you get in cherry 7up.

Finish - Light smoky brine, hint of seaweed umami, quickly fading red berry sweet.

Score - 89/100

Final Thoughts - Not really being a huge fan of peated stuff, I quite liked this. This had a bit of peat/smoke, but it was toned down and well balanced with the sherry. It was a nice balance and not overwhelming. The flavors didn't fight each other and worked with each other quite well with a salty component playing a pretty large role.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - Maybe, if the price was right. I'd value this around the $60-70 range"

La gamme Distillers Edition regroupe les distilleries Lagavulin, Talisker, Caol Ila, Clynelish, Oban, Cragganmore, Dalwhinnie, Royal Lochnagar et Glenkinchie. Chaque distillerie prépare ainsi son milésimées issue d'une double maturation en fut de sherry ou de porto. Cela ajoute une complexité. Il s'agit ici de la version de 2016. Pour avoir gouté à celle de 2015 et de 2017, je ne peux pas dire que j'y ai vue une différence pour être honnête. 'e produit est millésimé mais très constant. La distillerie de l'Ile de Skye a choisi un finish en fût d'Amoroso, 1 an qui s'ajoute à son vieillissement ""standard"" de 10 ans en fut de chêne americain, pour son Distillers edition. J'ai beau réfléchir et je ne me souviens pas d'avoir entendu parler d'un autre whisky fini en fût d'Amoroso...  Le degré d'alcool est de 45.8%, une belle couleur or, non filtré à froid et sans ajout de colorant. 

Deux récompenses: 
- Médaille d'Argent, Outstanding, International Wine & Spirit Competition 2013
- Meilleur Single Malt des Iles, World Whiskies Awards 2013

Nez: Caramel salé. Un sel marin. Une brise d'océan! un caramel bien moue et sucré. La fumé est subtile. Une petite épice pas trop loin... poivré? J'aurais aimé savoir le ppm... abricot et chocolat au lait. 

Bouche: Chocolat au lait! Sel de mer! Poivré et des fruits secs. Des raisins secs sucrés. La fumé est subtile et se confond avec le poivre. La texture est parfaitement huileuse et coule doucement sur le rebord de mon verre. Magnifique! le 45,8% est parfait! Je n'aurais pas demandé plus ni moins. Équilibré entre le sucré-salé, le fumé-épicé.

Finale: longue sur la fumé poivré et les fruits secs provenant du fût d'Amoroso. Puis, c'est frais en bouche... pas de la menthe... compte tenu de l'influence du poivre, je dirais du clou de girofle.

Overall: je ne passerais pas par quatre chemins, si j'avais une seule bouteille de Talisker à conserver, ce serait cette bouteille. Superbe complexité qui me rappelle le niveau atteint par Lagavulin. Je ne sais pas ce que l'on pourrait reprocher à ce superbe liquide... peut-être que l'équilibre ""trop"" parfait pourrait être perçu comme un manque d'affirmation? Un trouble de la personnalité? Pour ma part, je vois simplement une architecture aromatique bâti telle une œuvre d'art. Une bouteille qui va plaire à celui qui s'introduit à la fumé et à celui qui sait apprécier la complexité d'un spiritueux. Inutile de préciser qu'il vaut chacun de ses 120 $ CAD demandé en SAQ. 94% car c'est une bouteille qui sera toujours présente dans ma collection. Un must si vous n'avez pas encore gouté."

It is sort of like when someone hypes up a movie a lot and then you see it and are let down, well that’s how I felt. It sort of added this weird note that I can’t quite figure out. Maybe it’s a sour sort of moldy note that is off putting. This is not a horrible whisky but it for sure could have been so much better. Considering how all the other Diageo “Distiller’s Editions” turned out I am disappointed in this one."

4.5,"My bottle is marked 2003/2014. I have a genuine fondness for these special Editions. This one is altogether a treat, though not as much of one as the Lagavulin DE, at least to my taste (but it's so close). I opened it yesterday, nosed it a good while and then had a little taste to whet the appetite and begin the appreciation and review process. I did compose one but held off on putting it here. I'm glad I did since sometimes those first impressions are the whole story and sometimes not.  Stephanie is right. This is a confection, as the top line of the glass swirl begins to drip a myriad of thin legs and forms little arches like icing on a Holiday cake. The nosing to me reveals a honeyed, fruity, and peaty scent with slight iodine, smoke, orange and clove. On the tongue it is oily, briny, and light in body as per the thin legs produced in the glass. In the mouth, a medium smoky sweetness mixes with peaty goodness and it's off to the races to a superb and lengthy peat finish. This is the kind of peat experience I like best, much different than say, Laphroaig. A reasonable pour can last me a good while with this style and character profile. When one considers all of the attributes contained in this whisky, and as a comparison here in PA, offered at a 25% discount over the Laga DE, it is a remarkable achievement ... really well done. This is a very smooth drinking whisky and well crafted. If it had more of the irrepressible smoked meat of the Lagavulin DE, it would likely be it's equal, if not superior. But things being what they are, at least for me, it is not. But then again, it needn't be and shouldn't be, as it is quite fine as it is. Superb and 4.5 stars. I will purchase every year.

Talisker OB
Distiller's Edition
Distilled 2000
Bottled 2011
45.8% ABV
Price: 76 USD.  I have one more bottle I bought for same price.

My opinions on the Diageo's Distiller's Edition is that this is the only one that takes a good whisky and made it better.  The only DE that matches this in quality is Lagavulin DE, but Lagavulin 16 is a great whisky, and better than its DE counterpart.  Talisker 10 is a good whisky, but this DE is just ever so slightly better.  Also, if you have the option of buying older DEs, go older.  These fancy casks just seem to be spread thinner and thinner as Scotch becomes more popular, and wood finishes are taking on more and more shortcuts.

This sherry finish is well integrated deeply into the Talisker 10 maritime soul, and it offers more than just a sugarcoat.  There's peaches and figs with that seaspray and iodine.  You are bringing some non-native fruits and flowers to the harsh Skye coastline.  Made by the sea meets made by the garden in surprising harmony.  The only gripe is with the finish.  Talisker 10, on account of being less sweet, ends with a nice seeweed umami.  This DE ends with oaky astringency.

This is a brown bottle that looks better than the new design.  I've had the newer (blue) DEs, and I can't say they're much worse.  This is still a good buy, regardless of year, if you can find it in the $70-80 range.

Rating (price not factored): 89 / 100
Purchase satisfaction (price factored): 4 / 5"
4.5,"NOSE: Think hotel breakfast. Burnt toast with strawberry jam, smoked bacon with syrup, black tea. Burning candle. It really paints a rich scene.

PALATE: Maple syrup with pepper, finishes with salty bacon and pepper. Great texture.

OVERALL: For me, the best value bottle out there. Just unique and wonderful. It combines a popular recipe of peat + sherry, but delivers uniquely. Brunch in a bottle."

4.5,Like a better version of Talisker 10 which is already great. The precocious 10 year old goes through puberty and becomes a mature adult. The Talisker profile of brine/sea and smoke with additional sweetness and refinement. It's like they rounded some of the sharp edges off the 10 year. Those sharp edges are good and give character that is enjoyable but this makes it a more subtle and nuanced dram. Very well balanced.

4.75,"Ok, let’s talk. 

I was dubious for a while about the Diageo Distillers Editions. I still am. Most of them don’t have great reviews or are bottles at 40%. No thanks. 

Then along comes this one. This is unmistakably Talisker (brine, peat, pepper) but with a little extra. The sherry finish gives it a wonderful perfume-like nose that shouldn’t work with Talisker but somehow does. It’s get better on the palate as brine and pepper are integrated with flavors of sweet figs and raisins. Sweet and savory. The finish and the empty glass are a masterful combination of peat and sweet that lingers for days. Love it!

For you folks out there who are interested in bottle years, I got my hands on a 2015 version. The bottle itself is stylish (it looks like the same bottle that Lag 16 comes in) and the label is classy with all the necessary information. I’m giving this just shy of five stars because the Talisker 10 was what got me to fall in love with Scotch and it is perfect to me, so to rate any variation on that theme higher seems like heresy.I’d highly recommend this one without any hesitation for the well healed Talisker fan.

The 2002 Distillers Edition was one of my favourite whiskies, but sadly I finished my bottle recently, so I had to try a more recent bottling.  I’m very pleased to report that it doesn’t disappoint!

The first sip is caramel sweet and very fruity - apples, berries and plums - but still with those wonderful standard Talisker notes of salt and campfires.  As it develops you pick up layers of sweet spices, vanilla and dried fruits which fades to leave just sweet smoke on the aftertaste.

It’s a lighter dram than the 2002, but it still has that wonderful bulk of sweet fruit and a smokey finish.  Fabulous!"

4.5,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2006, BOTTLED IN 2016 AMOROSO SHERRY FINISH:

Amoroso means ""a person who loves"" in spanish. And since this my second Talisker matured in amoroso sherry casks, i searched what kind of grape makes this type of sherry wine, and the results were amazingly interesting: NO GRAPE MAKES AMOROSO SHERRY, SINCE AMOROSO SHERRY IS A BLEND OF SHERRY WINES. 

But what am i talking about here? Let me tell you this wonderful story. It goes like this: Sherry Wine makers used to produce oloroso sherry, which is drier, and then, add a 10% Pedro Ximenez sherry to it, because it is sweeter, to make it easier, more appealing to drink by women, so they would get easily tipsy. Then, women who drink this type of sherry will be more inclined to ""perceive"" the wine makers as good lovers, more ""amorosos"". That is why this blend of sherries are called like that. 

But what about the whisky?? 

Its fantastic. 

Bottled at talisker's classic strength, 45.8% this dram has a reddish color. 

On the nose it is wonderful, perfect. The first note i got was this dessert called ""lightning"" here in ecuador. You might find it as petisus or eclair, but not a chocolate one, but a caramel, light fondant filled one. That alone deserves 25 points. Blackberry marmalade, peanuts bathed in caramel in vanilla (they are called kandicris from manicris, google it), smoked toffee (if that exists); winey. DID YOU READ ALL THAT? THOSE ARE AMAZING AROMAS. 

On the palate, it is so sweet. Cherries, blackberries, raisins, grapes, very astringent. 

Aftertaste is where it feels more like talisker. It is peaty, salty, peppery. You know what i am talking about, a Talisker. 

Overall this is an instant favorite. The amoroso sherriness has influenced the whisky in a sweet, crazy way. Amazing rollercoaster, my score for it is 91 over 100."

4.5,"2002/2013 Edition TD-S: 5PB

This has been a firm favourite for several years, sadly I’m on my last dram from my bottle, so it now feels like a last hurrah.

At first sip this tastes like a sweet sherry, with those wonderful standard Talisker notes of salt and campfires.  Quickly, the taste develops into a seriously fruity dram, with dark jammy fruit.  The fruit is layered between spice and vanilla as it fades to leave just sweet smoke on the aftertaste that sours pleasantly as lingers.  Overall, a very lovely dram.  I hope I manage to find another bottle at some point in the future."

3.75,"Great full flavored, Dark flavors. Not the best Talisker, but still a great Talisker"
5.0,"With its dark colour, it is a variant from the usual 10 years old from Talisker. The effects of the Amoroso sherry casks is strong on the nose, with hints of smoked bacon and candied fruits. The mouth, on the other hand, is spicy, oily and smoky, with a bit of pest. The candies fruits make a comeback here, and the finale lingers in notes of smoke. It is a rich, seeet and salty scotch very well deserving of high praise."

21.3.2020 newly opened bottle
Glass: Glencairn 
Color: deep amber, red gold
Nose: Amoroso Sherry, prunes, brown sugar, salmon skin, raisins, sweet smokiness
Palate: gentle pepper and chili burn, sherry, alcohol vapors of the neck of the bottle, salt, leather, peat and turf. Time smoothed the burn and more honeyed butterscotch notes begin to open 
Finish: not overwhelming for long, fiery burn subsides into a tasty memory of the dram and a salty, very subtle taste on the tongue.

Overall a very good dram 4,00"

4.25,A little too sweet. I prefer the 10 year old.
4.0,A little peat on the nose and excellent sherry flavor on the palate with a little saltiness.  I bought it trying to expand on Islay whisky and I was not disappointed.

4.0,"The smaller island Malts seem to have a good balance between some of the best parts each region offers. There is a touch of peat and sea spray both on the nose and down the hatch. The vanilla and almonds are a bit stronger
 on the nose while some noticeable traces of fruit do reveal themselves after a few minutes of nosing. The color is quite fine for especially for a 10 year old scotch likely due to the amoroso finishing in age. All in all a delicious dram."

4.5,"Smokey but not overbearing. Brine, salty, leather notes, a hint of sweet. Excellent.
10/4.🏆"
2.75,"Cherry, sweet, aroma. A bit too alcoholic body & after"
2.75,"Ok, this is just yummy on the nose. Like a smoked fruit bubblegum. Cherries, fresh wood chips, sparkly lemonade. The smokiness and peat is a lot less than I remember it from the regular 10y old Talisker. But it still is noticeable and delicious. 

The palate is oak-woody. Very well balanced but not as deep as expected - more on the fresh smoky side. But everything is it’s right place and well leveled. 

It is a nice whisky. Nothing that knocks you of your feet but pleasant non the less. Easy to drink. I think this is a whisky everyone can find something about that he / she likes. It could be deeper and smoother for my taste but I would still recommend a dram."
4.75,"Just wonderful. 
Sweet smoky bacon, honey and brine on the nose. The palate is full in your face with sweet sour notes and goes over into BBQ flavours. The finish is all about smoky dry oak that stays for quite some time. 
It's a bit rougher than the Lagavulin Distillers Edition but offers more character und depth. A little oxidation helps to polish the edges. Fantastic dram, I just love it! (93/100)"
