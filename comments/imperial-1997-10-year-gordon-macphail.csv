3.5,This distillery opened and closed several times over its 100 year history finally closing for good in 1998 with its subsequent demolition in 2013. This release from Gordon & MacPhail comes from casks that were laid down in 1997. The dram itself is interesting. I tried this at Dramfest '18. The main taste profile I got out if it was 'rubbery'.
