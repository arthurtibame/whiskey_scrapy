4.0,"100% rye tastes like a 100% rye whiskey. Not too hot, very flavorful, overall very nice whiskey. A bit pricey for what it is but there’s a novelty factor given that it’s from such a small distillery."
3.0,"Maple syrup nose, grass & brown sugar"

3.5,"The first in the Reservoir series for me. Apparently they use 5 gallon casks which is interesting. Doesn't taste like it's been over done or turbo charged to much on the casking however. I wouldn't say I'd be reaching for a 2nd helping but it's a well crafted dram. Cherry, vanilla, leather, prunes and a healthy dose of spice and oak with a bit of a drying bite even with liberal drops of water. Not cheap at $100 USD. Definitely better ryes for under half the price out there."

3.5,Little sweet nose. Much sweeter and smoother than the bourbon and wheat.

Chairs and a pipe smoldering on a desk. The finish was great!"
