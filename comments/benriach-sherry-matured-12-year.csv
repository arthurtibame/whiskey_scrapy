3.75,"God bless the Twin Liquor dollar sale. Picked up some great deals this being one of many. This is a true sherry bomb scotch aged completely in sherry casks not just finished. Non chill-filtered with natural color. Poured neat, nose is wonderful strong and heavy sherry influenced fruits. We're talking cranberry, strawberry, apricot and cherry deep and rich with some background of vanilla and malt. Palate brings blast of sherried fruits again with some malt and light vanilla along with some coffee and wood notes. It is a bit hot so you need to hold it to extract all the flavor. Finish is long with coffee malt and dark fruit drying to wood. Very nice tasty scotch. It could use better mouthfeel and a bit more weight but make no mistake this is delicious. Overall the heat(lack of refinement) and thin texture keep it from elite 90's score but its close.........88/100..........If you like sherry scotch then you should try this"

4.0,I typically don't like Sherry whiskies that much because they go overboard with the sherry influence. But this one is special! This has enough Oak influence to get me onboard and less sherry influence on my palate to keep me interested. The finish is short and peppery but the sherry not overburdening my palate is a welcome respite. I have other Benriach whiskies in my collection and I appreciate the subtlety exhibited by the master distiller in designing this one.

3.75,"Matured in a combination of first fill Oloroso and PX casks, this sherry whisky delivers a distinctive aroma of dried fruits, raisins and bitter chocolate. At first, the nose is quite muted and featureless. After adding a few drops of water, you can find cinnamon, walnuts and even faint hints of coffee. BenRiach 12 Sherry Wood tastes sweet, intense and aromatic with Christmas spices, dark fruits and a delicate nuttiness. The finish is peppery sweet and surprisingly long with well-balanced oak influence. It's a solid Single Malt with minor flaws in the aroma.

4.25,"Leggero al naso, morbido al gusto e molto persistente, gustoso. La nota alcolica si fa sentire un pelino. Comunque sia é Il mio tipo."
4.5,"Nose - Sweet dark syrupy red berries, sweet caramels, hint of sweet mint

Taste - Gentle warm heat, nice pleasant sweet dark dried stone fruits, caramel, baked apples

Finish - Light sweet spice tingle, sweet sherry, fruity, light milk chocolate

Score - 86/100

Final Thoughts - This was a good basic sherried Speyside. A bit straightforward on the nose but it's nicely done. Nothing too complex, but very very drinkable. Best enjoyed neat, but I can see this being a good ""intro"" sherried Scotch for many. Nothing off-putting about it.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - If I could find it for about $40 USD"

3.0,"You can smell the sherry on the nose, along with caramel and oak. Sherry, chocolate, nuts on the tongue.  Peppery finish with a smooth buttery late flavour"
3.0,"Nose: An interesting nose of intense sherry, leather, old oak, cherries and cedar wood. There's also an orange aroma in the background, both orange juice and orange zest.

Palate: Lots of sherry, both sweet and dry, on the arrival together with dried fruits. It's a well defined and assured palate and the development brings out shortbread, caramel, raisins, walnuts, bitter dark chocolate, espresso and a little vanilla.

Finsih: Surprisingly short. Dry sherry and dark bittersweet chocolate, and a mild gingery spice in the aftertaste.

Very nice neat but it can take water with dignity and a dash marries everything together wonderfully, bringing out more dark chocolate and malty notes balanced by increased softness to the sherry. For some reason it always makes me crave a mild cigar.

The only fault is that it seems to suffer adverse oxidization effects. Once my bottle was down to about half way a bitter walnut and leather character started to become slightly too prominent.

It's a cut above the average but not amazing whisky and is certainly worth a try by anyone who enjoys sherry matured or finished whisky.

""Above Average"" : 3 stars"

3.0,Initially I really loved this whisky. It had beautiful flavour and richness but thin bodied. Still I preferred the oily thickness of a say a Glendronach. However having bought a bottle for myself recently it didn't just quite hit the lofty heights of previous tastings. I think perhaps the fact I tried initially with a bunch of other whiskies took the edge off the imbalance between the alcohol and flavour or just a different bottle. Once opened for a while it oxidized very quickly as do most Benriachs. It's hard to rate this one. initially when opened it was a 3.5 rounding up to 4 given only $55USD however it barely gets a 3 after being opened for 3 months. The flavour is nearly all dissipated
