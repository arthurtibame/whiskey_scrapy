3.0,"I tried this last night. It wasn't bad at all. It was very smooth and flavorful. The leading complaint I would have is that it may have been TOO flavorful, like too sweet with the vanilla. That's what I've heard about the maple and the apple Crown Royal as well. Either way, I'd gladly sip this again."

2.0,"For a flavoured whisky? Not bad--a nice cream soda vanilla nose that doesn't go too far over into cloying artificiality, even if the taste is simultaneously too sweet and too watery, with no discernible rye character. I imagine this might punch up Coke to create an alcoholic vanilla Coke. On the other hand, vanilla Coke already exists. So. . . . For anything resembling actual whisky? It's borderline poison."

4.0,"This is a pretty good flavored whisky. The vanilla leaves a bit of an aftertaste when drinking alone, but when mixed with coke it reminds me of Vanilla Coca-Cola. It's very smooth and better then the Crown Royal Apple."

2.0,"Vanilla birthday cake batter on the nose. The palate rushes in swetness with a syrupy mouthfeel and notes of vanilla (duh), maple, and marshmallow. The finish is fleeting but leaves a lingering sweetness in the back of your throat. The flavor is tasty, but it's just too sweet save for the transitional whiskey drinker."

4.0,"Not what I prefer because it is to sweet for me and the ABV is low. This is a smooth mild spirit, we'll made and has a great price point about $30 USD for 750ml you can keep for yourself, give as a gift, or share with friends!"

4.0,Mild sweet nose. Rich vanilla flavor with notes of sweetness. Sweet vanilla finish with a mild alcohol bite. Doesn't do well with Coke.

3.0,"Fine as a mixer but on its own I find it to be too sickly sweet and artificial tasting. And this is coming from someone who loves vanilla. Stick to mixing with coke and you’ll have a great experience, but don’t attempt to drink this one on its own."

1.0,"A drink for the kidlets when they're just starting out.

Nothing fancy, complex or interesting about this whisky. It's pure sugar and not good on the palate, especially at 35% ABV. If the sugar was dialed back and the ABV ramped up, then you might ...keyword, ""might"" consider this one.

Finger in mouth."

5.0,Extremely sweet to the taste. Great sipping ability. It’s good with coke. Very smooth to the tongue and a bit of a spicy aftertaste. Very little bite. Great with a couple of ice cubes in a glass.
