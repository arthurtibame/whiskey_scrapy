3.0,"And MGI mash, taken to Kentucky for bottling. Smooth mouthfeel, contrasts the hot spice from a 2 year rye. Dry finish with hints of licorice. Opens up a bit after uncorking."

3.0,Pleasant easy sipping rye. Not over complex but very enjoyable. Similar to Sazarac in that its more sweet than spicy and any spice notes are baking spices. Finish is meduim with a lingering oak and clove taste. Well done and worth the purchase.

5.0,"I usually steer away from the ryes but this one...this one is delicious! One the nose I get freshly picked apples, Allspice and hints of vanilla pudding. The palate delivers apple crumble, nutmeg, peppercorn, cloves and rye. This rye is perfectly balanced and is the ONLY rye I keep on hand."

Oh man... has this opened up. Still lively, but the youth is soft late spring fruits, herbs, morning dew, and fresh flowers! The mouthfeel seems thicker somehow. The balance of spice and herb and floral with sweet baked honey cornbread is perfect, with both sides of the equation packing punches of flavor.
This is a winner of a rye right here.
If you like Pikesville, I think you'd like this, though prepare yourself for more of the botanicals and less HH nutty yeast character.

Pinhook Bourbon N Rye Straight Rye Whiskey
93.5 proof, Lot 001
2/15/18
Freshly cracked wax top. Should be interesting to revisit in a month.
A: 
Tarnished gold. beady droplets make thin legs that disperse
N: 
Caramel corn and freshly baked honey corn bread, sweet, a bit honey, a bit corn, with some warm toastiness.
Air time reveals the rye grain spice.
T:
Super light! Like apple juice. This must be some young whiskey. 
Upfront it's grainy in a positive way. 
The oaky oils manifest in a resinous, sappy feel and flavor, with an almost piney tang. 
The fruit notes are an assortment of different fresh apples, estery.
The profile descents into more familiar rye territory further and further, bringing marjoram, thyme, and caraway to the fore.
F:
The finish is the lingering herbal bitterness of the marjoram, thyme, and caraway notes. It reminds me like having chewed a seed of bishop's weed (carom seed).
Not exactly short, but is only the lingering of those last flavor notes, straightforward.
O:
Nothing super-complex, but there are enough notes for this to be interesting, and I'd take it as an everyday rye over baby Saz and Bulleit... but not over Rittenhouse."

4.0,"Nose is floral and brown sugar. This is super unique. Sweet, creamy lychee fruit with wood and floral notes. Almost like a sweet blend of Whistle Pig and Rampur. I like this a lot. 4.12."

5.0,"I can't seem to step away from this whiskey. It is extremely refreshing in a world that advocates for smoke, tobacco, and char. This whiskey is in a world of its own. 

The nose is sweet and perfume forward, yet has a persistent young wood/fruit wood smell. Anyone that has smoked or grilled with an apple/cherry wood will recognize the odor. 

On the front, there is very unique crisp and lemony sense. With most ryes you have a massive peppery bomb, but this is much more subdued. It has almost an herbiness to the pepper notes. Like a fresh arugula. 

The finish is my favorite part. It has a cooling, menthol like finish with almost 0 pepper accents. It is very refreshing. 

This is an amazingly rare whiskey that goes great with any white fish or lighter seafood dish."

2.0,"Smells herbal and minty. Very floral on the front end. Sweet. The end is less unique than the front. Very obviously a rye. Some will love this. It's like a smoother, thinner (but still creamy) version of some of the hyped ryes out there. 7/21/18"

3.5,"Nose is sweet: perfume aroma, apple/cherry wood, lemon rind.

Taste: herbal, minty, and floral on the palette. Crisp. Green apples, lemon, herbs, arugula, allspice, nutmeg, esters, and of course woody. 

Easy to drink, sweet, and florescent."
4.0,"Like a fresh cut lawn.  My buddies and I did a tasting of ryes, to include EHT, WFE, and this one definitely held its own.  It was just so different from the rest.  It’s definitely in my rotation of ryes for when I want some different."
4.25,"Fresh mown hay and grass, green Apple, chamomile flowers, clove spice. This MGP-sourced 95/5% Rye/barley juice has been aged just enough to soften a bit, while retaining its major rye spice and herbaceous taste. A drop or two of mineral water brings it alive. It’s VERY different—a Canadian Whiskey or Scotch drinker’s Rye—but a limited availability treat at a great price. Worth seeking out!"
3.0,"Smooth, sweet, light bite"
2.75,"Heavy perfume, green apples, and herbs on the nose. Taste of perfume, apple, mint, and some herbs along with a touch of lemon. Oily mouthfeel. Young overall."
