3.5,"While my reading suggested that this was a travel retail exclusive, somehow the state of Pennsylvania had it available.  The hue is a medium hue and a little oily.  The nose has hints of dried red berries, cinnamon and leather.  The mouth has a caramel and buttery taste then the cinnamon comes back with a little more intensity.  The finish is long but not too intense.  The cinnamon starts to give way to black pepper with the faintest hint of smoke.  All in all a rather nice dram."
4.0,"I don’t understand the low user rating. This is very good, the sherry cask is present! The only negative I would give is that the mouthfeel is a tad thicker than I like."

3.75,Good tasting Blend!
null,$50 for a half bottle- sign me up. I wish they all had 1/2 bottles available - anyway: this stuff is good. If you like old scotch you will like this. The finish is classic dewars smoke - but the mouth feel and complexity are excellent. Do I know it’s a blend? Yeea. Do I know it contains grain and whatnot? Yeea. Do I like it? Fuk yeea. Buy and you won’t be disappointed...... on a side note - for the cost of the damn super nice sexy packaging they could have probably offered a full bottle at this price. 🥃🤘🏼🥴

2.5,"Is it a scam to put a 375 ml bottle in a box twice the size of most 750's?  I'm not sure but I felt cheated when I got this home to realize it was a 375.  Then again...for 50 bucks, maybe it's on me.  

Nose - butter scotch, chocolate, and vanilla.  

Taste - This one really evolves in your mouth.  The buttery chocolate and vanilla rises up as the alcohol coats the mouth and there is a rush of oak and vanilla spice.  There's a fruity character that starts to come out for me once I acclimate to the dessert notes.  A bit of dark fruit...raisins or plums, some classic sherry notes but well back in there.  

Finish - long and lingering.  Mostly butter scotch, oak, and some of that sherry element.  

I'm torn, I want to be mad about the small bottle, but I can't be upset at all with the insanely high quality whisky in here. I'm still only going with a 2.5 here.  There's some off notes in the mix, even a few younger whisky notes in a 21 year, but man for 50 bucks, I know it's a small bottle but it's worth a gamble if you're a fan of blended scotch.  I'm still debating the older expressions....I don't rebuy this but I might have to spend the 130 for the 30+ year old just to see.  

Please note again the 50 bucks was for a 375 which makes this more like a 100 dollar bottle.  Not a horrible price for a 21 year old whisky and for the most part you get 21 year old notes on this one."

3.0,For sipping neat.
3.75,"This one is a minimum 21 years, NCF(!), and underwent a four stage process (including sherry casks) that, for the purpose of space, Ill describe as interesting for its eye towards consistency -and- depth of flavor. I paid ~$65 w/ tax for a 375ml.

Nose:
Golden raisins. Kiwi fruit. The best parts of that first sniff of a great red wine. Luxurious, even the smokiness which you can pick up but is at the end. Hides some honeysuckle dryness over herbaceous mint. Opens when neat in the glass to a light brown sugar with more exotic or vine-ripe fruit--blackcurrant jam and nice green tea. A nice one. It uses the sherry to create an excellent depth without being too fussily-layered or elusively complex. Spiciness turns up a tiny little bit everytime you come back to the bottle. 

Palate:
The Dewars signature honey is everywhere but it doesnt ever get in the way of many, many great things going on: apricot, in-shell almonds, delicate oak, tons of lip-smackingly good sherry. Sadly this section was kind of weak overall. It has some great tastes and they are presented amazingly by the nose but it just doesn't do much for me profile-wise that I couldnt get out of the La Santa or something else notably cheaper. It was good tasting, but for the money I'm going Dew12.

Mouth:
Tries to steal the show from the nose and almost gets away with it. Easily the best I've ever had just in this specific section and for blends. 46% and it exhales like you drank air. Intoxicatingly shifts between smoky and sweet as you sip on it in the very back of your throat. The bottle says 'ultimate smoothness' and they werent kidding.

Overall I'm going 3.75* instead of 4* because I truthfully had higher hopes for the tastes here. This isn't exactly ginger beer dram but it doesnt do a whole ton for me outside the easy drinking and amazing nose."
4.0,Very decent blended older whiskey. Probably wouldn't have bought a whole bottle but this half size is a great way to put high age statement whiskies out there for curious drammers. Sláinte.
