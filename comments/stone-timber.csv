3.5,"Nose - straight forward with nice notes of caramel, vanilla and maybe a touch of green apple.   Not abrasive given the fairly high proof.

Palette - full, good mouthfeel.  More caramel, apple and banana, and light oak.   Good balance overall given the ABV.

Finish - light oak to moderate amount of spice.  Finish is moderately long, transitioning to a touch of bitterness on the backend."
