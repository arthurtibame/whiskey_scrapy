3.0,"Rich toffee smell, a pale and youthful look, but still somehow very rich. Acutely spicy - though it's only instantaneously poignant as opposed to deep and rounded. Unexpectedly, the barley comes off as sweet and pronounced in this one. Very woody and oaky, fresh and green - it's definitely a spring dram. At first I felt that it was harsh and overly forward, but it has really grown on me as I've slowly gone through the bottle. Put a single cube of ice in it, and in my opinion you'll unleash the 'virgin' impression that's latent in this bottle."

4.0,"A true bargain. At $30 this over delivers. It's a young whisky and shows its youth but that's ok. Aromas of lemon and apple and yeast. On the palate, it's fruity and oaky with a pleasant sweetness and I don't like my whiskies too sweet. The body has a nice viscosity that coats the mouth nicely and is very warming. A very nice everyday sipper at a great price."

4.0,"Great value.   Tastes nearly fully matured, but has more alcohol nip than a standard 12 year old especially at over 46 percent abv.   I would say if you're in the mood for a rich full bodied, Highland scotch this will do the trick.  Not my favorite, but i do enjoy coming back to it every now and again.  Can't go wrong for the price, it's head and shoulders above all blended Scotch brands imo except maybe compass box... But it's let expensive!  Immediate competition would be Tomatin Legacy which is more refined but not as full bodied to my palate 3.5."

2.5,"Scotland, September 2017. Whisky #7

Nose: Lemon, vanilla, fruit and some oak.

Palate: A continuation of the nose, and fairly similar to the 12 year old but sharper and more grippy, with a lot more spice including pepper and hot ginger.

Finish: Rather hot and spicy but short.

Knowing this features virgin oak in the maturation you can't help but think of it as a NAS version of the 12 year old that has been force-matured by pumping up the wood influence.

Too idiosyncratic for me - the spicy notes are over prominent with nothing hefty enough underneath to support them, which makes it come across as brash and young. I had this at the distillery and was glad to have tasted it, but I wouldn't buy it. 

""Average"" : 2.5 stars"

3.0,"Another Friday evening finds me with another sample.  I have seen Deanston on shelves but never really thought much about it and almost never had a sample (save a quick taste two years ago).  The tour group, courtesy of Ryan, has allowed me to taste this and not just sample.  How was my experience?

Tangerine citrus aromas start the tasting process intermixed with cereal (in the vein of Grape Nuts).  More time and some honey sweetness creeps up (which makes a somewhat healthy breakfast in a normal sense).  Lastly, a touch of floral with dried hay rounds out the nose.  

A medium-dense body is immediately striking with black pepper spice and ginger root.  A fresh and clean sensation takes over the palate.  As you work past the spiciness, you can detect some light-brown sugar sweetness.   A crescending of heat and burn arrive late towards the start of the finish.

The finish is medium in length and what remains are lemon bitters and bittersweet chocolate.  A somewhat odd mix, but works well here.  The curtain call is ginger all and a touch of wood oak, like a toothpick chewed on for some time.

This is definitely young and vibrant.  An easy sipper that is pretty straightforward and upfront.  Not flashy or dynamic, however refreshing.  This works well as a summer sipper.  I was pleasantly surprised.  [Dry Glass: Butterscotch][85/100][Tasted: 8/18/17]"

4.0,"I'm finally getting around to getting my review posted on this interesting NAS single malt from Deanston.  I've had the 12 year old version before and found it thoroughly enjoyable.  This sample was supplied by my friend Ryan as part of our distillery tour.  It's non-chill filtered, has no color added and comes in at a robust 46.3% ABV.  It's a hipsters wet dream as well- claiming to be certified organic, produced at a clean energy facility and packaged in recycled/recyclable materials.  Talk about saving the planet one dram at a time, bro.

The nose starts out interestingly enough with nice blasts of citrus and honey.  You really get a lively, youthful hit of oak and pine as well.  Zippy!

The palate also contains an initial bite of peppery/ginger notes from the oak that really grabs your attention before melting into a creamy, toffee-like finish.  It's very bourbon-esque and would easily work well in your favorite American cocktail.

The finish is oaky and hot but doesn't linger to the point it would seem one dimensional nor irritating.  The warmth also follows the spirit down into your belly.

The only criticisms I find are that it imitates American bourbon so well that it doesn't make me feel like I'm drinking a single malt scotch.  If I had a full bottle I'd probably use more of it mixed with Coca Cola.  It's a relative bargain here in the states with full size bottles running just shy of $40.  That also puts in on par or slightly more expensive than most run of the mill bourbons and that would ultimately cause me to pass on buying my own bottle.  Still, thanks again to Ryan for supplying this one so we can tick it off the distillery list.  3.75 stars.  Cheers, my friends"
4.0,"The nose is very pleasant, honey sweetness, cereal grain, a little oak and fruit. Palate definitely carries the sweet honey, some spice and does have a nice pleasant warming finish with some silkiness to it. Overall very pleasant to drink, definitely straight with no added water or ice."

null,"Paid $33 for this bottle. This is a bottle kill review. I will try to summarize what this bottle offered.

Nose: Young in a good way.  Like Alisha Keys when she dropped her first album.  Not young in a bad way.  Like when Justin Bieber dropped his first album.  Virgin oak is a good description.  It’s oaky, and vanilla-y.  But it’s virgin… y?  What?  That was bad.  Anyways…
Palate: It’s well balanced and smooth at first, and then the wood spices say eff this, and take over.  Eager-to-please virgin oak.
Finish: It’s a delicate balance between the bitter tannins and the vanillins.  A little bit of black liquorice and nutmeg too.  Interesting for an NAS. 

Look here, for $33, you don’t get Mizunara.  But fuck Mizunara.  This is virgin American oak, and it works wonders.  And this shit actually regenerates, and is sustainable.  For $33, this is a no brainer purchase.

Mark: 81/100 (range 76-85. N = 6)"

3.0,"Age: NAS
Alcohol: 46.3%
Paid: $33
Maturation: Ex-bourbon and virgin American oak

This is how you unapologetically leave off an age statement.  Price it well below the top shelf stuff, give it an honest ABV, and use some virgin oak trickery to complete the subtractive maturation process.  You can’t expect something less than $40 to blow your socks off, but there are no complaints from me about this whisky.

Bright, honey lemon tea.  Definite oaky base notes.  Spiciness takes over on the palate before the citrus and oak tannins re-emerge on the finish.  There’s subdued vanilla throughout.  The time in the virgin oak really takes out any unpleasant sharpness or metallicness that’s expected in a cheap NAS whisky.  This can handle some water too; livens up the nose without affecting the taste too much. 

MARK: 81/100.
Recommended purchase."

4.0,"Nose: fresh lime! A lot less peppery than last batch and very smooth citrus.

Taste: ripe citrus fruits, a little sharp, medium bodied.

Aftertaste: medium with some spices 

I would say this is a stronger flavor Glenfiddich 12. Both sweeter and spicier. Which makes me think this is a 8-10year old whisky. This batch (tasted 2017 July), show more bodied, much more smoother, and very refreshing at the same time. For the price, recommended!"
4.0,"Stop number 24 on the SDT is Deanston. This Highland single malt is a NAS that is composed of young whiskies finished in virgin American oak casks. Bottled at 46.3% ABV and is non chill filtered. It appears to be natural color of golden straw. 

The nose starts off with a warm pop of citrus. Tangerines, oranges and apricots. It moves into wonderful baked apples and pears. Nice warm toasted oak with nutmeg and a little cinnamon and a hint of ginger. There is toffee and light butterscotch as well. There is a definite malty character, like whole grain bread that's half way done cooking. I also get wet sawdust oddly enough. Caramel and more toasted oak on the back end and some candied fruits. 

The palate is warm and inviting, very drinkable. Ripe to overripe apples and pears. A touch sharp, showing its youth, but I'm enjoying it. Oak with nutmeg and toffee. A medium spice level and a light heather honey. 

Light to medium bodied, and a little on the thin side. Fairly dry. 
The finish is medium long. Spicy and spirity with sharp oak, honeyed apples and cinnamon. 

I wouldn't say this is better or worse than I expected, just different. This is a young whisky (I would guess between 5-10 years), and I suspect the virgin oak finishing didn't go much longer than 6-9 months. Having said that, it is very flavorful for a NAS. It's a touch rough at times though. 3.75 for this scotch on its own merits, but if you add in it's incredible value ($36 locally) it's a solid 4. Thanks to Ryan for the sample. 
Cheers"

3.0,Rather good for $35. Smooth with a little burn due to the slightly higher proof. Sweet nose with fruity notes.
2.0,"Cheap, so happy for the experience to price ratio. It's very much like licking a raw oak barrel. Faint sweetness, strong alcohol on the approach. But very barrelly."
3.0,"I've no idea what to make of it...I literally just had it, and I can't remember what  I had.  It's mild.  Milder than a Balvenie.  Floral honey.  I think, not sure.  Maybe floral heather.  Either way...this is a mighty fine dram for someone new to whisky.  I certainly wouldn't want to pour a newbie a dram of Ardbeg or Laphroig...I'd forever lose them to those horrid pink rose wines.   They'd be turned away from whisky forever.  Instead, if it's just an acquaintance, I'd pour them this.  If it's a close friend that's a novice, then a Balvenie 12.  Thanks to Ryan for this sample---it's part of our round 2 of our little Scotch sampling team."

Smells better than it tastes and it was a gift so I don’t know what it cost, can’t me much it came with two branded glasses."

3.0,"Until I read the comments here I thought it was fully matured in virgin oak and was surprised at how mild the influence was compared to say the 14 year glendronach virgin oak which I loved. The Deanston is a pale shadow of the GD. It's not bad but nothing special..vanilla, honey yadah yadah...all muted and overpowered a bit by slightly astringent alcohol. 3.25. It's very cheap at $40USD here in NZ but definitely wouldn't buy a bottle."

3.5,Almost fruity neat nose. None of the promised “slight smoke.” Maybe smelling pineapple but palate was off this night. High woody notes. Heady alcohol burn. Would be hard pressed to call it complex but the things it does it does well. Would be overpowered by any food. Flavors are delicate and difficult to tease out. Water opened it up nicely but reduced nose considerably.

3.75,"Ive seen mixed reviews on this but wanted to try a scotch finished in new oak barrels. No age statement but non chill filtered, no coloring, 92 pf and certified organic (good start). Poured neat, thick heavy legs. Noses dense malt, yeasty bread dough, dusty beeswax with a hint of spiced apple. Slightly oily mouthfeel. Palate has rich malt sweetness,doughy honey bread and oak with good heat. Finish is malt, oak and char with cinnamon helping out. You can tell its young as flavors are not fully developed, yet Im enjoying it nonetheless . I really like this profile in a scotch (little to no fruit, no peat and good malt flavor). The bread dough note is very tasty and there is more barrel influence than most. Delicious pure scotch flavor along the lines of Bruichladdich Classic without the smoke & pepper(albeit lesser version). Overall I would absolutely buy again. Great value in the $30-35 range imo. 87/100 ..........Oaky doughy malty scotch!.....12 yr is even better!"

Strong molasses and finished wood. It does benefit from a drop of water in the burn, but that gives it a waxy, spicy component.

Some sea salt on the lips, caramel and sherry. Finishes with a little bit of lacquer/nail polish. Not sure if it's the char on that virgin oak but it definitely has a sweeter Bourbon character, but still in the overall Scotch genre. I must be on a cinnamon kick too, because again I'm catching quite a bit of it at the late stage. 

The body is chewy and thick, a little sticky. The burn cannot be overstated: I inhaled by accident and when I coughed I swear a little fire came out.

It's pleasant, but a slow sipper, preferably out of a wide-mouthed glass and with a droplet. And I got it for $30 which I think is a steal."
