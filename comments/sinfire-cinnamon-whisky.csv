5.0,"Not too sweet, very nice cinnamon spice.  Way better than  Fireball"
2.0,"I wish I could give it 2.5 stars. It's similar to Fireball but without all the sweetness. Cinnamon flavor is pure and intense, but no whiskey flavor. Somewhat bitter, kinda like chewing on a cinnamon stick. Bitterness is less noticeable when cold (as recommended). I appreciate the pure cinammon quality. But without whiskey flavor, and without sweetness, it is niether interesting enough nor tasty enough."
