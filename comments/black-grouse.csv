3.0,Sweet and smoky. Very drinkable. Won't hurt the wallet. Very nice to have in the cabinet for any occasion.  Introduced to this dram at whiskey education course in Indianapolis.

3.0,"Not a bad Smokey Blend.  Not always easy to find in the States... but if you're looking for something easy to drink but still peaty - this is nice.  It's not overly complicated, it's not going to blow your socks off - but it's cheap and worth a try.  I prefer Black Bottle when it comes to cheaper smokey blends - but this ain't bad!"

4.0,"I'd probably give this three stars in a straight rating, but in terms of value it wins some extra points because it's so much better than I expected from a $30 Cdn. scotch blend.  Heather honey, surprisingly rich smoke, a little fruity. Sweet. Shows its provenance--I definitely get some shades of Highland Park, which I've heard is a constituent malt. Nice to have around for when you've had a couple better drinks to start but the night is marching on."

null,As others have said it is a touch more smokey than sweet.  The finish isn't great in my opinion harsh alcohol Finish. But with a little ice/water goes away nicely really opens  up on the rocks or with a little water

3.0,"A bit of smoke and a hint of peat, followed by a sense of something missing.  Somewhat thin in both body and palate. Finish is short and sweet, leaving a taste of ash in your mouth.  For $35, this is a pretty decent bottle of Scotch, with nothing really objectionable and a few strong points. If you're drinking popular blends, I strongly recommend it over the traditional J&B, Dewars White, and it's head and shoulders above Johnnie Walker Red Label.  JW Black Label is quite a bit smoother, with more body and overall refinement, but lacks the smoke found in Black Grouse.  For the price, it's well worth looking for and picking up."

3.0,"It's thin, has a smokey roll-over, a leafy finish and a sharp burn going down. But sometimes that's just fine. It might be the beautiful picture of the grouse on the label talking to me, but it'd be perfect in a flask, with a breach-load hanging over your arm, waiting for dinner to fly by. Better than similarly priced Black Bottle by miles in my opinion."

3.0,"For the price, it is surprisingly good. The arrival is good, the peat a nice aromatic variety (highland park). It lacks complexity though, and the finish is too short. At this price and considering the target audience, it's hard to fault."

2.0,"I waited for months to try this one,as I regularly drink the famous grouse.  I am disappointed. This whiskey burns the tounge throughout the entire dram . Start to finish. Itried it with water,then on ice,and nothing gets rid of the burn.  Very unpleasant to me."

3.0,"I picked up a 50ml of this to try after liking my bottle of Famous Grouse. Definitely more peat and smoke than the regular ""Famous"" expression. Did not enjoy it as much as the ""Famous"" at first, but after 10-15 minutes in the glass, it really opened up. Gained a definite chocolate malt note to compliment the peat giving it an edge over the ""Famous"". Worth the couple extra bucks it'll cost you to move up. I can see a full size bottle of this in my near future."

1.0,"Not for me! Strangely, the first dram was smoky and tolerable, but the rest got cloyingly sweet and medicinal tasting. I am not talking about that nice TCP/Iodine medicinal taste from Islay either. We're talking down right nasty to the point that I couldn't finish the bottle.  For the price, get the Monkey Shoulder or a better blend."

3.0,"Nose - Lightly smoky charcoal, dark apple/pear cider/juice, ripe strawberry/cherry hard candies.

Taste - Apple juice w/ a hint of bright cherry/strawberry juice sweetness, initial faint smoky ash that transitions into a white pepper heat.

Finish - Lingering sweet smoky apple juice, faint white pepper heat, smoky ash that turns into an ashy bitter feeling on the tongue, similar to taking a deep breath at a campfire the morning after it has smothered out.

Score - 71/100

Final Thoughts - This is not bad, but it's not great. It's relatively lightly peated and it's not horribly offensive like what I get from a Laphroaig 10 which is very rubber/iodine/bandaid. This is more like an old campfire ash peat which is tolerable. It has this lightly sherried apple/pear juice intense sweetness throughout that has a very thin mouthfeel. I could see this being used as a lightly peated variation of a blended scotch for use in a cocktail. I'd struggle to sip this neat on the regular.

Would I drink it if offered? - No

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"
