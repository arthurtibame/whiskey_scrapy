5.0,It's like rye coated with caramel. Danish concept with Scottish quality standards. Must try!

4.0,"The creativity that makes Danish design so covetable is in full flow here. Tasted blind, I would have pegged it as a bourbon from its creamy nose and as a spicier bourbon/rye hybrid from the body. What matters is that it all flows as beautifully as the lines on a B&O loudspeaker. My sample was three years old and super smooth in the mouth, with lots of caramel on the aftertaste. Grab a dram if you come across it."

Rich and oily and loads of rye developing into something almost like grappa before a thunderous finish. 90."
