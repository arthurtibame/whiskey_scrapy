3.75,"Here’s a fun nose: bananas, caramelized sugar, vanilla and a hint of extinguished flames - in short, Bananas Foster. Take a sip or scoop up a helping with your pudding spoon and you’ll be rewarded with a rich and creamy mouthfeel and a hint of bananas, before it turns more typically Ardbegian with a dusting of dark chocolate. The finish is long and sweet, like a slice of pineapple in melting vanilla ice cream. A splash of water brings out some peaty spice - let’s call it nutmeg to continue the dessert theme.

This is another delicious twist on Ardbeg, but unlike previous releases I can’t imagine myself finishing a bottle any more than I can imagine eating all the Bananas Foster in New Orleans. Actually, I can imagine the latter, but it doesn’t end well. It would make a great substitute for a dessert wine and a sweet gift for a dinner party, but overall I’d say this is a must try rather than a must buy."

2.0,"Was drum the point where Ardbeg jumped the shark? Was the CR even better than the standard? Lets find out. Double review will be posted to both. Drum CR vs Standard. 

Nose - On the CR Bannans, oak, light smoke, candied cigars (I get this almost always on peated whisky but especially ardbeg).  I'm getting a bit of really young but used barrel oak notes. OK I'm getting similar notes here, but I'm getting more cigarettes. I'm getting more of a fire cooked fruit.  Yeah the CR is more vanilla/bannana and the non CR has way more going on. 

Taste - CR -  I do get the pineapple, the bannans, oak, vanilla, powdered sugar, light smoke, a bit of brine but not much. It's complex, it transitions, it does come off a bit young, but a lot of people want that on peat and actually it's really lacking the ardbeg peat punch.  The non CR is more subtle, clearly watered down, but I get more from it. Most importantly I'm getting just a lot more peat more Ardbeg. Yeah there's more brine, more smoke and all those things I want in an islay and they really make themselves noticed on the finish. 

Well put some water in the CR!  

Nose on the CR does change a bit, but it's still not as complex as the non CR. It's more burnt vanilla forward. 

Taste - water here makes the CR drink younger with more harshness and more of that banana and youthful oak. It does extend the finish and gives me more of an ardbeg profile of smoke. The non CR has more of what I think of as Iodine (but to be honest I've only known that flavor through whisky discussions so grain of salt on that please). 

Overall - they're the same score for me, but the non CR has a better nose and taste. The mouth feel however on the CS CR makes up for both short comings. Are these good whiskies? They're ok. 2.0 and frankly they'll be a weird one to discuss. MSRP at some stores near me were the same for each. A few even sold the CR for less when it came out than the non CR. Legit know a store that did 120 for CR and 130 for non CR. 

So this is the review for the CR. If you're like me and mouthfeel is HUGE, I think I might at the end of the day pick this one up, and full disclosure when I first had these two, I was 100% sure I'd say the non CR was better. I still think from an intrinsic whisky review standard it is better and I'm confused as to why. Does Ardbeg have better water than I do?"

5.0,"The nose is amazingly complex. Salted caramel, vanilla,  banana, pineapple, and definitely peat. The taste follows through on all the tropical fruits and the peat and the finish has a very peat heavy bite."

4.0,"I really enjoyed this. It is definitely not an everyday sipper, rather something to be savored when the mood is right. I don’t think that the rum cask influence is too strong, but you can definitely taste it. To me this pairs nicely with the Ardbeg smoke and gives a new twist on the ‘sweet peat’ that I enjoy so much."
3.0,Too much rum influence for my tastes.
4.75,"@Richard-ModernDrinking and I had a tasting last night where we shared a few drams with each other.  This was my 2nd best of the night, out of 12.  The only one in the tasting that was better was a 10 yr old Macallan from the 80s.  This was amazing—-smoky, resinous, pine and sweetness.  Just absolutely memorable.  If it’s still available and reasonably priced, you wont go wrong getting it.  Thanks Richard for sharing this!"

3.5,"Sweet Ardbeg smoke. Given my prejudice against rum I was delighted that I couldn't pick up a hint of it anywhere. As with most of these committee releases, they've been enjoyable but the price creep keeps me from buying a bottle; I'm happier getting ~3 of the 10."

4.25,"Wonderful stuff. 

Nose is heavy on banana, sugar, graham cracker. Smells like a banana cream pie or bananas foster. I don’t get much peat here.

Palate has peat and smoke, though it’s balanced nicely with the sweetness. Not very fruity. Earth, old leather, and oak.

Finish starts sweet with more banana and rum, though it quickly fades. Not much burn. Heard described as a dusting of dark chocolate and I highly agree. 

Very much recommend."

3.0,Mycket tropisk frukt som är rökt.
4.25,Loved this. Not as aggressively peaty as the usual Ardbeg fare. Huge fruit notes. Aged in rum casks. Wunderbar.
