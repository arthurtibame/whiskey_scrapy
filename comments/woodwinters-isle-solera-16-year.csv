4.5,"I had to google who woodwinters were. They are a wine and whiskey merchant in Scotland and this particular whiskey is a 16 year Bowmore. I knew this was going to be a good one as the customary sip just after cracking it open before adding water and time was a good one so given it was cask strength and very drinkable straight and non-oxidised I knew it was going to be a winner. I added the bottle on distiller a short time ago and someone else also agrees. This is Bowmore done right. Great casking and beautiful spirit. Caramel, salted raisins, xmas fruits, smoked maple syrup, dark bitter chocolate..just perfect albeit slight hint of sulphur coming through which adds character and a herbal aftertaste..Bar the slight adversion to the sulphur and herbal side I really can't fault this one at all. I do love the Bowmore characteristics it's just the spirit is often badly handled. This is from a single oloroso cask apparently..my favourite sherry type. This is definitely my top 10 of the year."
