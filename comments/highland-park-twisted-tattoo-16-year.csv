4.5,"This has the signature nose of Highland Park with heathery peat and soft fruitiness. On the palate, it’s very complex with both dark fruit flavors from the Rioja casks at the forefront and some of the sweet, spicy Bourbon flavors in the background. I’ve tried a lot from HP and this is probably closest to the Fire edition but still very different. They always manage to surprise me! An excellent, beautifully presented limited edition and a bargain if you ask me. 94 points"

3.5,"Peated started, citrus middle, super strong cherry finish"
4.0,"You're scrounging through abandoned cars, and find a bottle of this. Unfortunately, several zombies find you while you are in awe of your luck. Make them pay for interrupting the moment.

Smells like sweet tarts, and then some wafting smoke. Light peat hits up front, some smoke, some heat, which turns into a honey/heat, then fades to a subtle berry taste. The warmth lingers on your tongue for awhile.

This is one bottle you'll want to rescue from the horde."

4.0,"Not your valfather’s Highland Park: the peat punches with the ferocity of a tattooed seaman, amplified by the rich undercurrent of the wine influence. Delicious, expensive."

3.0,"I wanted to write a few more interesting reviews but the distillers ap is just such an awful tool and we still can't add whisky with an actual computer (well I guess I could install blue stack and then download the ap and use my desktop but what a pain just to add whiskies). 

Anyway, a bit more well known brand. Highland Park, perhaps second to macallan in terms of whisky prestige but unlike macallan they seem to be able to put out a good product at generally reasonable prices.  This one coming in at 100 bucks for a 16 year age statement seems like a pretty big win.

Nose - I get vanilla, some red wine tannins, a bit of a spice, perhaps a strawberry. 

Taste - Great transitions on this one. It opens with some sweet bourbon barrel cask notes, vanilla, caramel, cream, etc. Then it transitions to vanilla and red fruits, I'd think sherry if I didn't know it was a red wine. The the finish goes into this really nice long and lingering oak and perhaps some kinda of red wine like dryness. There's still some bourbon elements as well in there. Given HP uses peat I assume I'm getting some in the finish as well, but without knowing that I'd have thought it was more coming from the oak but peat sensitive people will notice it.

I came into this one blind, neck pour, and my only review notes I'd heard were a few people who were fans, but not exactly people I tend to follow closely. 

Water is a pass on this one, brings out oak without much else.

Anyway for 100 bucks and at 46.7% I think we've got a winner guys. I think this is a very reasonable value and I'm scoring it a solid 3.0. Absolutely worth picking up if you see it for about that price point and honestly unless you're ultra peat sensitive, I'd be willing to say this will be a winner for any scotch drinker and most whisky drinkers in general. I used to say HP 18 was the best way to show someone what scotch is. As the price on that has gone up and the abv remains 43%, I think this one might be the one in their lineup to introduce people to."

3.0,"I had several Highland Park whiskies now and they have a special taste uniqueness that you definitely can taste in all of them. While this one is really nice as well, now that I had the 18y you don't really wanna go back to anything younger or the multiple NAS they have. They all have the typical HP note but the 18y just brings it all together much better.

Until I have tasted something older than the 18y from HP I wouldn't really want to get or recommend something else. And if the price tag doesn't allow for the 18y I think the 12y is still the best alternative. I still haven't figured out why HP does all these different NAS and special editions."
4.25,"A little peat. Some honeysuckle. It's oily, coating, warming, and the finish lingers. Very good. Very good indeed."
