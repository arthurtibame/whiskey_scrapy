I have a bottle of this at home that I'll be pushing on unsuspecting visitors to try and get rid of it faster.  Overall, it's kind of like sherried rubbing alcohol.  I've sat with this thing several times and I'm not getting anything more than that out of it.  A friend bought a bottle for a tasting we did and it was even worse out of a fresh bottle.  Not a fan and not something I'd recommend."

2.0,"Most scotch that is finished in sherry will have a nose that is overpowered by it. This is certainly not. A wonderful aroma that is actually more familiar to rum; honey, fruits. The flavor is not for me personally as it tastes very strongly of raisins and dates, but it has a remarkably smooth finish.  I can definitely see this being a popular choice, especially for the price. If it were a darker color and a bit thicker you would swear it was rum."

4.0,"Revisiting this new version of Tomatin and what a difference! With a nice new label and bottle design to go with it. Still not very complex but that classic Speyside/Highland profile is there and it it satisfying and priced well.

Nose: The usual suspects of citrus and apples wrapped around a very nice milk cream note. Orange sherbert!

Taste: No surprises but you can taste the quality. Touch of honey and a thick mouthfeel followed by orange peel, lemon rind, grapefruit, tart apples. Over time the wood spices make an appearance.

Finish: Citrus, oak, maybe some dark chocolate, mild bitterness.

This is the best deal out there right now for under $40 If you don't like smoke /peat on a daily basis.

Unfortunately it will probably balloon in price to $50 bucks like every other quality lower priced Scotch I discover. 

Ancnoc 12 was $40 and now it's creeping close to $60. How do they expect to gain new customers with these prices? Macallan 12 is getting close to $70 in NYC. Insanity..."

null,French Oak version - Red Fruits
3.0,"I decided to do a simple side-by-side tasting of two 12 year Highland single malt Tomatin:  this sherry finished version alongside the French oak.  

The color is kind of light, but the nose is really promising:  sweet fruit and honey with a nice whiff of the sherry cask coming through.  I believe the bottle said it was aged on ex-bourbon barrels and finished for a short 6-9 months in unnamed Spanish sherry casks.

On the palate it starts off very sweet but is quickly overtaken with oak- and lots of it.  It washes away the sweetness a bit too quickly and finishes sort of harsh.  It's a lengthy, yet hard finish.  Boozy for only 86 proof.

My initial impression is that it isn't offensive by any means, but it's suffering from a serious identity crisis:  the nose leads you to believe this wants to be a poor man's Macallan (no offense), but the heavy oak burn and finish really keeps me from rating it higher.   It's only $35 a bottle so in that aspect I guess it shines- a single malt that's cheap and readily available.  I think if they had advertised it as ex-bourbon barrel and let the sherry be more of a pleasant surprise it would've worked better IMO.  Cheers."

2.0,"Overall not great, not bad. The nose is full of fruit, raisin, and honey. The taste is a little empty feeling. Spice and woodiness come through pretty strong, but not very rich for a sherry finished whisky. The light color is a bit of a giveaway in that reapect. If it was more expensive I would have been disappointed, but for $33 I can't complain. A good scotch to share with a friend you aren't trying to impress, or as your 3rd or 4th glass of the night."
3.0,"For $30 this is very cheap single malt. Not too bad, doesn't have the fresh fruit bourbon taste as one would expect from its maturation in ex bourbon barrels however the sherry is quite notable.

Is it good? Meh, is it bad? Not at all. This whisky is very medicore that is all"

3.0,"By accident I ended up with both the new version that states it's aged in ex-bourbon and sherry casks (fatter black box with green trim), and the older version which just mentions sherry casks (thin black box with red trim). Since they're so cheap I might as well hang on to them both as something to sip mindlessly while watching TV, and while I'm here, why not compare the two?
    
    Both are 43%. Color is virtually identical, making me think there won't be any significant differences. Nose on the older version is saltier, more complex. Pancake syrup, wet cardboard, corn, a bit of sourness. Newer version has a darker, weaker scent, bourbony oak is there, also something like latex paint. Both of them have sub-par noses for single malt.
    
    Taste wise, older version is mildly sweet with a peppery finish, and has more of a bite than I expected. Newer version is a bit more complex, there's a winey sweetness, less bite and a milder finish.
    
    So, there isn't much difference between the two, the ex-bourbon barrel adds a bit of depth to the newer version, yet has a much lighter nose. Both of these are the cheapest ($31 ea.) and worst single malts I've had, yet both are perfectly drinkable and are not offensive. For another $10 you'd be better off with an Old Pulteney 12 or Laphroaig 10 or something else, but that's one of the great things about single malts, even bottles on the lower tier are decent."

3.5,"Although Tomatin 12 is classified as Highland Single Malt, its smell and taste are very similar to classic Speyside whiskies. The nose is sweet and mildly fruity with apple puree, vanilla cream and honey, whereas subdued sherry notes linger in the background. A surprisingly intense arrival with spices, baked apple and caramel is followed by rich maltiness and hazelnuts. Bittersweet chocolate characterizes the soft and moderately long finish. Altogether, a pleasant but unimposing whisky that is reasonably complex without being overly demanding.

4.0,"Economy single malt!  Never had Tomatin until this $30 bottle I bought on a rainy day several months ago.  Let’s go.
  
  NOSE: Granny smith apple after you dropped and bruised it and hesitated for 2 days on whether or not you should eat it.  The sourness continues… and I smell grape peels and lemon.  Sherry is there, but this is unbalanced sour.
  
  PALATE: Indecisive and watery arrival.  Yeasty and, at its best, apple pastries.  Orange peels after a few seconds.  Oloroso is in the background contributing maybe a raisin and a half.
  
  FINISH: I can really taste the sherry influence now.  There is a lingering raisiny jam aftertaste that is pleasant, if not forgettable.  The apple flavor becomes bitter, which is forgivable given the price point.
  
  VERDICT: It’s worth it at $30.  I won’t be buying a second bottle, but it’s got enough character to be a guilty pleasure when you feel like you’ve done nothing to deserve a dram, but you want one anways.  MARK: 76/100.  I usually translate this to 3 stars, but because it is an economy whisky, I will add one star."

But tonight it's two. Yeah, pushing the envelope to borderline party crazy here.  First thing I just realized is that my palette and olfactory senses should've been cleansed before going to this, right after the first dram.  I should've known better.  It reminds me of when I was 26, doing my semester study abroad for my MBA in Paris at the Sorbonne.   I stopped by a perfumerie on the Isle de la Cite, called L'Artisan De Perfumer.   I had no intention of buying the overly pricey perfumes considering I'm on a student account, but there was this beautiful salesperson I was hoping to get the attention.  I'm going from perfume to perfume smelling it, and she brings out a bowl of roasted coffee beans.  I take a handful, put it in my mouth and chew.  Almost broke a damn molar.  She then says in that lovely (albeit snobbish) French accent ""monsieur, the coffee bean is to smell, not eat.  Maybe monsieur meant to go to a cafe instead ?""  Anyway...back to present time...I should've cleansed my palette before having this, cause all I got was breakfast cereals.  With a twist of lemon.  Thanks to Lee, another sample as part of our sampling team.  Oh...and to end the story...I ended up getting engaged to Nathalie, the perfumerie clerk.  And roasted coffee beans taste horrible, but smell amazing."

3.0,"Review transfer from Barreled from September 2016. 

This review is for the newer bottle style that is labeled as Bourbon & Sherry and not just Sherry Finished as stated on the old style bottle. 43% ABV and it appears to be colored and chill filtered. 
Nosing the cork, which I always do before a pour, I pick up on the bourbon barrel influence immediately. I also wipe any excess whisky from the neck after the pour with my hand, rub my hands together and nose that (it really gives a good indication of what you can expect in the glass).  Again I get more sweet bourbon with vanilla. Nosing the glass however is very different in this case. The bourbon is there, but the Sherry cask influence really shows up with the typical raisin/dried fruit notes.  Red apples and pears are present with some brown sugar, showing there is still some bright youthfulness to this single malt. 
The longer it sits in the glass the more sweetness comes out. 
On the palate there is an initial mild spicy arrival and it actually has some peaty undertones. Very sweet in the development after about 15-20 minutes in the glass. Nice oily mouth feel that may indicate that it is not chill filtered after all. 
Oak spices, vanilla and a sort of spicy sweetness on the finish, which is medium in length. 
My guess is that Tomatin is fully maturing in both ex-bourbon and ex-Sherry casks, then blending rather than Sherry cask finishing. 
Even though it is quite diverse and fun to nose, this is still a middle of the road scotch. Good for guests who like bourbon and scotch but don't want anything too powerful. I would give this a 3.5, but the fact that I got this for $33 raises it to 3.75"

Went to my local ABC and after much deliberation and a recommendation from one of the employees, bought a bottle of this for $33. It was surprisingly smooth, and the bourbon and sherry cask finish definitely impart a fruity and rich nose to it. The mouth is subtly fruity and slightly sweet, and it glides down like water down the throat. 

While I'm sure I will find myself attracted to many more expensive and prestigious scotches, I could absolutely see this being a go-to scotch for a nightly take-the-edge-off  glass."

Gently sweet on the tongue then nothing.  No flash of flavor.  Empty.

It has a lovely nose of honey, hay, sweet baked apples and a hint of citrus and spices on the background. The palate is just ok with citrus sweetness, spice and apple tartness. It ends a little drying with a  bit of bitterness in the end. But I like it since it gives a little complexity for a very straight forward malt.

This is a very simple, average, affordable whisky and I like it for what it is."

3.5,"Glendronach is often called “a poor man’s Macallan” (rightly or wrongly- I actually prefer Glendronach as a whole), and Tomatin 12 Bourbon & Sherry Casks may be a “poor man’s Glendronach”. It’s a very nice mix of ex-bourbon and Sherry casks, very easy sipping, and no off flavours. At $59 CAD in Ontario, it’s easily the best malt whisky in its price bracket."

4.0,"Makes sense now, that this brand is owned by a Japanese company. Poured this into a Glencairn glass, and nosed it. It immediately reminded me of Yamazaki 12 year. So much so, that I ran downstairs to my bar and grabbed my open bottle of Yamazaki 12. Size-by-size, the noses are virtually identical, although I get more ether/alcohol on the Yamazaki 12. The palates are also nearly indistinguishable. Some apricot, honeysuckle, pear, apple, and hint of floral notes on the end.

The main difference between them is on the finish. The Yamazaki 12 has a finish that warms your stomach after about 30-45 seconds. A gradual warming sensation, zero burn, and it lingers for a good 20-30 seconds. The Tomatin 12 year finish is only a fraction of the Y12. Still, there’s no burn. A gradual warming sensation, after 10-15 seconds, and it’s gone after 5-10 seconds. Other than the finish, these are indistinguishable to me. 

Price/Value ratio is a no-brainer. 
I paid $125 for the Yamazaki 12 year. 
I paid $35 for the Tomatin 12 year."

3.0,"Appearance: Looking into this little highlander I find the color of light clover honey. The dram’s legs are medium thickness and watery.

Nose: The nose starts off with notes of salted caramel, then moves into notes of wildflower, light incense smoke, red wine, apples, and dry grass.

Taste: The palate I didn't find as bold as the nose. Red apple, apricot, buttered sweet corn, and cocoa powder were the notes that I found.

Finish: The medium finish leaves a semi-oily mouthfeel along with a bitter then minty aftertaste.

Thoughts: This highland single malt was a delightful dram. It wasn't very complicated but it was very friendly! This would be an excellent starter scotch to anyone new to the game! It's a tad boring to those who have much experience however. My vote - I would recommend it, but I probably won't buy it again for myself. I bought this one in a small sample trio, and I am excited to try this scotch’s older siblings! Tomatin, thank you very much! Sláinte!"

Creamy rich malt on palate with some spice and light smoke. Lack of fruit notes as it is very malt focused. Nice finish with smokey malt and cinnamon oak lingering for a while. It is weighty, full bodied and really delivers the barley. Not a ton of flavors in play here but excellent presentation of what it has. Straightforward robust malt and strong value"

4.0,"Initially I was wary of single malt Scotches under $40 in NC because I thought they'd be crap, but I dove head first when it was on sale for $30. Imagine my surprise, this is a superb whiskey. I've had a few single malt and blended Scotches this year (Monkey Shoulder, Dewar's White, JW Black, Chivas 12, Auchentoshan American, Glenlivet, Glenmorangie), and this is better than all of those. It tastes most similar to Glenmorangie 10, but sweeter and less drying on the palate, and $10 less. I get more complexity from the oloroso finishing that I don't get from other flagship single malts. It also has a similar profile to the popular blended Scotches I've had, which makes sense since Tomatin is a mass producer for blenders. I honestly don't understand some of the reviews I've seen for this on whiskey blogs, it is one of the best affordable Scotches I've had. This is really easy to sip and enjoy, and at 86 proof has slightly more punch than most cheap Scotches."

Gently sweet on the tongue.  Relatively one-dimensional and 100% in-line with the nose.  Honeydew, unripened pear, and cereal grain.  Astringency throughout the mouth that says it’s a touch more harsh than the 86 proof, but not unpleasant.

Here at the end of the bottle, it still leaves a lot to be wanting, but my opinion has improved significantly over my initial tastes.  Not anything special and a relatively pedestrian Highland, but IMO it’s a touch better (and cheaper) than Glenlivet and similar whiskys."

I prefer my Scotch neat so I think I'll be sticking to the $50-$200 dollar range going forward. Monkey Shoulder is the same price but much better."

3.75,"750ml poured neat in Glencairn at home.  The packaging really throws the notion of ""the softer side"" at you, so I am not expecting strong notes of anything in particular.  

Nose has mild peat and sawgrass, green apple, tobacco.  Overall mild.  Taste has some black pepper on the front, with apple, leather, touch of oak, then finishes with some lingering spice that is a tad bitter, but not too much so. More assertive than the nose.  I rather like this, and would not pick ""softer side"" as the predominant descriptor as they do.  For me, that is selling this short.  I think the time in the bourbon and sherry casks has imbued some nice spicy and stonefruit notes.  This was on sale at VA ABC for $33.99, and that is a real bargain.  Very glad I picked this up.  9/5/19."

3.0,"This is my third Tomatin expression following the Cu Bocan and the 14 yr Port finish. I enjoyed both of those bottles so let’s see what the base expression has to offer. 

The 12 year is aged in both ex-bourbon and ex-sherry barrels. It’s bottled at 43% ABV and is a bright gold in the glass.Not sure about coloring or chill-filtering. The color makes me think it’s not colored. Tomatin is a distillery that was built specifically to produce malt for blends. When the current whisky boom hit, they began to bottle their spirit as a single malt. It produces quick skinny legs when given a spin. 

The nose is primarily sweet floral barley. There are also subdued notes of raisins, figs, and orchard fruits - apples and pears.  Nice, but nothing special. 

The palate has light honey, and the orchard fruits carry over from the nose.  Some biscuity notes make an appearance on the back end. There is a thin mouthfeel that some reviewers have described as “silky”. I’d have to agree with that characterization. 

The finish is moderately short with cinnamon and cloves, dry oak tannins, and just a wisp of smoke at the end. For $33 this is not a bad value malt. It won’t change your world but it will make you happy. 3/5. Cheers!"

Combining the ex-bourbon and sherry casks supplies wood, sweetness, vanilla, and sherry. There are hints of ripe fruit, a strong malt presence and a hint of nuttiness. I don't pickup on the smoke that Ctrexman notes, but I have already said more than once elsewhere that I think his palate is more discerning than mine. (I admit it, I am jealous of that. And, also, of my wife's---she can eat a wonderful dish in a restaurant, and then duplicate it at home the following week I digress.) Overall, this is a very solid, affordable, sherry finish Scotch."

Sweet and lovable, with this soul from a candy store infused with ripe fruit (mango, yellow peach, apricot) and brown sugar, very welcoming and caloric. A marked herbaceous note stems the diabetic explosion.
And it is the herbaceous profile that makes its way onto the palate, very fresh and clean, at times balsamic, with the more subdued confectionary tendency expressed by raisins, ripe fruit, honey, orange peel and malt again, which gives warmth and a pinch of salinity. Less expressive than the sense of smell, but more balanced.
The finish is medium, herbaceous and saline, slightly spiced with honey and raisins.
A nice introductory whisky, not too complex, easily affordable (also for the price) without being anonymous or flat, an effective expression of the Highlands for those who want to start discovering them."
