4.25,"Peaty and smoky nose, with fresh undertones of citrus, blackberries and apples.
Peat and dark chocolate taste, with again those blackberry flavors. Full, rich and smooth
The finish is fantastic and long, with tobacco, chocolate, and dark oak notes."

4.25,"After coming down off the highs of two rich Armangnacs this on first taste was disappointing however adding water really opened it up. As SH said vanilla, coconut, butter and more. It really is a lovely dram on the palate and lingers long on the side of the tounge. Now a couple of caveats. It says it's the peatiest dram...hmm that I just do not get. I suspect it's a case of measuring the peat levels of the barley then distilling it in a number of ways which miminise the end result. Although as PBM mentioned a while back there comes a point your palate really just doesn't notice additional pbm levels (I just noticed two acronyms with two separate meanings!).

I think where this one falls short a bit for me is i'm not a fan of the more lighter acidic peat type drams I prefer the rich full bodied Lagavullin 16 or Laphroaig 10 / Lore approach. The aftertaste is less than the mid taste. It does carry with a nice warming glow but nothing spectacular. Still if you are a fan of this peat style I can see why you would rate it so highly it is excellently blanced and executed on the mid palate.

I'd rate this 3rd after the Black Art 4 1990 and Octomore 10 yr Dialogos. 4.25 - 4.5."

4.0,"I never thought I'd be a fan of a strongly peated whisky.  I remember my first time I had a lightly peated Caol Ila, and I almost had to spit it out.  How my tastes have grown to a broader palette.   I really like this one...big sweet smoke on the nose, sort of like being around a campfire roasting marshmallows.  The taste is incredible---citrusy-smoky-sweet.  Did you ever grill  lemons over mesquite charcoal, and then use those lemons to make lemonade?  That's what this taste like.   The finish is smooth with a waft of delicate smoke.  The only reason I gave it '4' instead of '5' stars...the price.  Quite pricey for a 5  year old.
On a side note...FINALLY...Lance Mayhew and I agree on something!!!  Till now, I generally ran opposite of his recommendations...hmmm...maybe to go back and give the other drams a 2nd chance?"

5.0,"If you're looking for a great whisky that you can drink every night while you relax in front of the TV this is NOT that dram.  Complex, bold, vibrant, demanding; the descriptors could go on and on... This is an amazing whisky! Absolutely over the top, yet understated; rich and full, yet delicate; hot and spicy, yet sweet and floral.  It's an oxymoron in a bottle...like nothing I've ever had before.  Pop the cork and a campfire fills the room (my wife smelled this from 18 feet away the instant I opened it). Getting past the smoke and peat, you can find a bit of old leather (think horse saddle or well-used carpenter's belt) and a field of fresh-cut hay.  The palate opens unsurprisingly with smoke and sweet peat, but doesn't dominate and hide everything. Citrus, hard nuts, vanilla, stone fruit and rose petals are there for the tasting, all wrapped in an underlying honey-like sweetness.  The finish is all smoke and takes forever, leaving an ashy taste in your mouth for more than an hour.  Add water, and things get even more interesting!  The nose stays the same, but the smoke is amplified and dominates the palate entry before a showcase of sweet peat, pears, vanilla and clover honey cascade across your tongue.  The finish is slightly drying with a pleasant numbness preceding the campfire that leaves your mouth dry and wishing for more.  I've never had a whisky get more smokey with water, but this does.  Eminently drinkable straight, but almost a different dram when cut to about 50% ABV.  I know it's expensive, and I know it's hard to find, but if you love Scotch, and you like Islay malts, you simply must try to find a glass of this..."

4.0,Had a quick taste of this at the Baltimore Whiskey Festival. It was much more balanced than I expected with vanilla and a wonderful mouth feel balancing the well-stated peat.
5.0,"Although this is undoubtedly a ""peat bomb,"" with a staggering 167 phenol parts per million, what's so surprising about this lovely dram is the complexity on hand.  On the nose you get, sure, ash and smoke and peat, but there are also floral notes to be found and a pleasing honey and vanilla sweetness.  I also detect a lick of sea salt as well.  That dance between the warming smoke and the delicate sweetness is repeated on the palate before being overtaken by an impressive smokiness that never becomes overbearing.  Despite the high ppms and the 57% ABV, this is a very easy drinking spirit.  It's like someone tossed a honeycomb onto a peat fire.  Delicious."

5.0,"6.1 is probably the introductory Octomore.  It is the cheapest (I purchased my bottle for $136) and most easily found.  Caviar analogy: if Islay whiskies are fish eggs, Octomores are from the sturgeon, and the Octomore x.3 is the Beluga sturgeon; if you only have the funds to splurge on one bottle, you may as well go for the 6.3 or the 7.3, which are in the $200-250 range.  Octomore 6.1 is solid, but a mere gateway to an expensive and heavenly range.  NOSE: Sweetness, smoke, and brine in perfect balance!  It is glued together by a rich buttery oiliness.  This is what Corryvreckan wants to be.  It literally smells like caviar.  Campfire embers and gasoline are in the background.  This is a tamed 167 phenols.  The numbers are a gimmick, and are probably measured right after malting.  It does not reflect the smokiness of the distillate.  TASTE: The peat explodes.  Bruichladdich believes in terroir, and it shows in their Octomore.  Strong heathery, earthy flavors.  There is smokiness, but also there is a taste of unsmoked soil.  A good youthful profile of fresh barley and lemon zest emerges and lingers into a long finish.  A long chestwarming feeling and aftertaste of hydrocarbons make you feel like you can light candles with your breath.  WITH WATER: Nose gets sweeter and fruitier.  Caviar and grape jam.  Palate loses the explosion of peat, but you get more subtlety and iodine on the arrival, with a drying earthy ash taking over after a few seconds.  VERDICT: Octomore publicity is based on extreme phenol levels and an “I-dare-you” variety of word-of-mouth.  It is actually as sophisticated and luxurious as an Islay whisky gets, with so much more to offer than a proverbial peat-punch to the face.  MARK: 94/100."

4.0,"WOW, I think I just grew chest hair! Really good stuff here, with notes of honey and lemon zest on the nose. The palate is herbaceous and slightly sweet, with an obviously generous dose of smoke. On the finish, there's a nice touch of bitterness akin to dark chocolate that lasts for minutes on end, coupled with wood spices that needs water to tame down. Great stuff."

Bruichladdich Distillery OB
Octomore Edition 06.1 Scottish Barley
5 years old
57% ABV
Bottled 2013
Price: 174 USD

I finished my SECOND bottle of this gorgeous peat monster, and that is the only Octomore that I can make that claim about.  Part of that is because this is fairly available where I am, and prone to being found on sale, and part of that is because this is irresistibly delicious.

This whisky is a mammoth in the La Brae tar pit.  Oily hydrocarbon-covered tusks right up your ass; so beautifully balanced with fully mature bourbon influence.  This will rival a 20 year old single malt in complexity, but you need some water to bring this down to about 46-50% ABV to smooth out the sharp edges.  I swear, soot fleetingly precipitates out of solution when water drops hit this 18k golden liquid.

Behind the sooty and tarry smoke, there are exquisite notes of vanilla, pineapple, coconut, butter, and sea salt.  And, yes, there is caviar.  The finish is long and dynamic.  Occasionally, I even get pickled vegetables and MSG towards the end.  If you have a fondness for peat, this will be a luxurious experience; a quintessential Islay hug.

Rating (Price not factored): 94 / 100
Purchase Satisfaction (Price factored): 4.5 / 5"
