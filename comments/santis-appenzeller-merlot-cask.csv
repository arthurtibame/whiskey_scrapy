4.0,"At the tasting last night at @Richard-ModernDrinking, for me this was the surprise hit of the evening.  We all expected the Octomore and Michter 10 to do well, but this was out of the left field.  Swiss do a lot of things really well ( watches, chocolate, banking, and pharmaceuticals).  But whiskey?  

So...this is a 7 yr matured exclusively in Merlot cask.  I’d expect really winey notes.  But no... one word summarized this one best: milk chocolate.  Creamy chocolate-y, with a taste of fruits and nuts.  

Hard to find, but if you do, will be a treat."
