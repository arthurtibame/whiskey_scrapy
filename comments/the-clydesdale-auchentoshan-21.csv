5.0,"I finally had a reason to open this bottle. Under 300lbs for the first time in almost 2 decades as of today. Rewarded myself with a 2 hour workout and now a taste of this beautiful dram. 

Got this bottle from my little sister and her girlfriend for my 30th birthday last year. Been sitting on my top shelf waiting for a reason to be opened. A little bit more information, this is a single barrel whisky, distilled in 1991. 215 bottles were made of this, and I am very fortunate to own one of those. Because just as I was hoping it would be, this stuff is amazing. 

On the nose it starts very inviting with peanuts (don't get those very often in scotch), some bitter spicy oak (21 years in a barrel do that), some light vanilla, and a beautiful note of stewed orchard fruits. Not too sweet, just fruity. Might be even a bit of cinnamon in there. 

The taste is very alcohol forward at first. It is a cask strength dram with an ABV of 56.2% after all (for some reason the app didn't allow me to enter the .2, so it's 56 up there). After a few seconds of burn, the real beauty of this liquid starts breaking through, and by god, this might even be on the same level as my all time favorite, the Hibiki 17 in sheer beauty. There is a base layer of vanilla, some crunchy peanut butter (I mean really, objectively speaking, crunchy is the only legit peanut butter anyway), several spices from cinnamon to pepper, and those sweet fruity orchard fruits from the nose are very present in the taste as well. It ends with a healthy dose of dark, bitter roasted coffee that give it another layer of complexity. 

The aftertaste is very warming thanks to the proof, with bitter coffee and cinnamon notes that just make you want to dive back in. 

I was hoping that this would not disappoint. And my expectations where more than met. This is not standing on too of my shelf for no reason. 

If you can ever get your hands on a bottle of this, or at least a dram, try it. It's worth it. Now I'm going to relax with the rest of this glass. Enjoy your saturday folks."
