4.0,"This is a genuine rarity. Only 3000 bottles were made, a 20yo bourbon, John E. Fitzgerald was an excise man who had the key of the distillery, and he drank from the finest casks: yes, this an enhanced ""Larceny bourbon"". 

45% abv, chesnut color.

On the nose is INCREDIBLE AND INTERESTING. Gum. Candy. Cotton candy. Solvent. Milka chocolate. SPECTACULAR.

On the palate is unbeatable. A sherried, spice explosion. Wonderful.

But....

The aftertaste is inexistent. No aftertaste at all  :(

Overall i think this is a great great dram, but not having aftertaste... well, a lot of points were deducted. I love the story and i love the 375ml bottle, but you got to be true to your ratings so: 80 over 100. 

And it surely feels like more."

4.0,"You can really tell that the casks they used for this were part of the old Stitzel-Weller stock. It's actually VERY reminiscent of Pappy 20 but without the exceptionally long finish and more of the citrus replaced by a slightly metallic, copper-ish note. The vanilla background that you get in ORVW and Pappy is also toned down slightly to reveal more of a dank woodiness. The nose to me wasn't anything to write home about, but it does a fairly good job of letting you know what you're in for: Smooth, without much of a burn at all, some cherry and other miscellaneous fruit in the background, and the mix of vanilla/wood and copper I mentioned before. It's definitely worth experiencing and I might even buy one for myself if it were $900 for a full 750mL bottle, but for a 375mL decanter it's a bit pricey for what tastes essentially like a tweaked Pappy van Winkle."
