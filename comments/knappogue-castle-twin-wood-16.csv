4.0,The nose is fantastic.  Tastes rather sweet with a bitter finish.
1.0,The Sherry is overwhelming and unnecessary. I just can't find the appeal of this stuff.

2.0,"Light scent of dried fruit and chocolate milk on the nose, followed by an overwhelming hit of lumberwood on the palate. There are faint notes of papaya fruit halfway through, but otherwise an oak-heavy, and considerably bitter finish. Pretty bad."
3.0,"This is unfortunately a downgrade from both the 12 and 14-year-old Twin Woods. It just isn't that great. The nose is especially most peculiar, because its strange combination of oak and raisins creates the false impression that you're having a rye whisky. The palate has more pronounced notes of those raisins coupled with nuts. The body is flat and the finish terribly short. In sum: largely forgettable."
4.0,"Visual:  Medium amber/gold color. Darker than the 12-year and 14-year, but since they are all artificially colored, I think the distillery’s coloring choice has more to do with it than maturation. Thin to medium legs that take a little while to slide into the glass.

Nose:  Nutty and grainy like the 14-year, but with more vanilla and spice. Two extra years in ex-bourbon casks seem to have had an effect (note that even though the name says sherry cask, the sherry casks are only introduced for the final six months of maturation). This definitely has a more bourbon-like nose than its younger sibs.

Palate: Sweet and nutty like the nose, with some grain and a little spice. The savory notes of the 12-year and 14-year are diminished in the 16. Also, all the flavors seem to be muted as compared to the 14-year (which I tried side-by-side), which I suspect is the result of the lower, 40% ABV. Like the 14-year, there is a nice sweetness, but it is not over the top. 

Finish: The finish is woody, and slightly bitter, with a bit of almond. The length is medium, and the warmth is surprisingly similar to the 14-year despite the lower ABV.

Empty glass: Candied nuts.

I like this better than the 12-year-old, but not as much as the 14. I think this might just be the superior juice if it weren’t diluted to 40% ABV, but I guess I will never know. I’m giving it four stars as I did the 14-year, but it is a less robust four stars (call it perhaps an 84 versus an 89)."

null,"Review #7 of 12 from DC Whiskyfest 2018. I was only able to do 12 because I came down with something that afternoon that really messed with my head and stomach. I should have just stayed in the hotel room but I didn’t pay $350 for VIP tickets to sample my pillow!
No scores for anything sampled as I don’t think it would be fair.

Heavy oak, bourbon notes, wine-y grapes, raisins and dates on the nose. 

The palate was heavy oak but good, raisins and quite dry. 

I was excited to try this one but don’t think I’ll seek out a full bottle. Good though"
null,"""** Disclaimer: This review is what I would consider a “Quick Hit”- meaning I won’t have my usual in-depth notes that I usually like to take. The reason: this sample was poured at Whiskyfest DC on 4/17/18. All of these reviews will not be scored and I am actively looking to try them again at some point to do them more justice.

This was the first Irish whisky I tasted at the festival and it lived up to the hype:  it was smooth and creamy while still having a nice flavor profile of vanilla, oak and a little heat.  I’m glad @Generously_Paul told me to go get a pour before the VIP hour ended.  It’s a quality malt and I’d like to try more from these guys.  Maybe when our Scottish Distillery Tour ends and we begin the Irish version.  Right, @PBMichiganWolverine, @Telex, @Scott_E?"
5.0,"With all the great bourbon and scotch out there, Irish whiskey is generally relegated to the background of the whiskey landscape. Even Japanese whiskey has surpassed Irish in terms of popularity, at least in recent years.

Yet, there are some Irish distilleries that can play ball with any the biggest and best in any category. Most know of Redbreast and the Spots. Knappogue Castle is every bit as good those two. Though it isn't all that well known, these guys continue to set the standard for single malt Irish whiskey. Their special barrel 12 is one of the bottles that really got me interested in whiskey, so I'm excited to have worked my way through their lineup and now to finally have this 16 year old.

Quick note: This and the standard 12 year have been bumped up from 40 to 43 ABV. This is one of those bottles.

Nose: Heavy sherry influence and nuttiness. It's walnut, plum, cranberry, strawberry jam, poundcake, date, fig, and raisin. I also pick up cereal, malt, apricot, orange peel. Some shortbread cookie, but less than I get on most Irish whiskies. There are some baking spices and black pepper, along with the heavy oak I've grown to expect with KC. Solid nose.

Palate: Once again, there is a serious sherry influence. That strawberry jam note comes through most prominently, along with the poundcake, fig, and date. Now, there is now ripe plum and milk chocolate. The walnut note remains quite prominent. I also get vanilla, apricot, cantaloupe, honeydew, green apple, malt, cereal, honey, and shortbread cookie. Fruity and floral, and while the sherry makes itself known, it is not overpowering. Toward the end of the palate, it's big oak and cinnamon spice. Awesome.

Finish: Traditional sherry-cask finish. It's a cross between a slice of vanilla and chocolate cake, sweet red fruit, and orange citrus. As it fades out, the oak and cinnamon resurface one last time. Moderate length, and a great closing act for a superb whiskey.

I'm continually impressed with KC. This may not have the VFM of the 12, 12 SB, or 14, but it is remarkable in its own right. I pulled the trigger on this one when it went on sale for $80, down from $95. At the former price point, this is a no-brainer. At the latter, I'd be on the face, but it's by no means a bad deal.

My only criticism is that it doesn't nose like a 16 year old. It's complex, but surprisingly green for what is. This minor flaw is quickly rectified with the palate; this is easily in the top 5 best Irish whiskies I've tasted. 

Now that I've cleared the original core lineup (as well as the Special Barrel 12), I'll be looking for either the 21 or the new wine cask releases. Either way, I implore any fan of Irish whiskey to give these guys a shot. Once again, a job well done to Knappogue Castle.

Subsequent tasting adds a couple new notes (plum, etc.) Felt the need to bump this  up to a 5/5 after putting it head to head with some other elite Irish whiskies. This one definitely leads the pack for me. Simply amazing."

4.25,"The nose is soft with raisins, sherry, oak and a slight spiciness. The palate is rich with a soft spiciness and sweet sherry full of citrus marmalade, brown butter and lemon tea. The finish is medium with fading sherry, lemon tea and baking spices."
4.5,"Unrivaled smoothness, this is one of the best Irish's that I've had. A little pricey given the Knappogue 14 is unique and excellent in its own right for 30 bucks cheaper. The 16 is so good you'll have to exercise restraint to make it last... try the Knap 12, then 14, then 16 to get the true elevation or variation of Knappogue's esteemed line of Irish's."
