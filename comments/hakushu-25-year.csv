3.75,"Almost floral aroma, citrus zest and light mint. 

Mild sweetness, citrus with light peat and herbs on the tail end."
5.0,"Crisp apple and slight amounts of phenolic and Smokey pear. Adding some water and waiting 25-35 minutes let’s the nose become richer (more honey and rich apple pie notes - think to the malt mash at the hakushu distillery, it’s right there). It’s extremely soft and delicate throughout especially after waiting and adding water. Again wish I had a bottle of this - had this at the Yamazaki and hakushu distillery for 2900yen per shot."
