4.5,An excellent whisky. I enjoy the sweet aroma with the hint of spice taste. It leaves a very pleasant aftertaste and wanting more. The flavor seems to grow after a taste as  you let it down your throat. It opens up the lungs and feels warm inside with a slight woody smooth aftertaste. Yummy!
5.0,"Very, very tasty. Lots of flavors of fruits and sweetness. Heat kick is on the back end so up front it goes down smooth. Great oily texture; almost like a chewy type feel as well. So enjoyable."

2.0,Did not like the sherry
4.0,"Tasted 9/3/19
I found this to taste better than the double oak 12 year. I would compare Macallan to Glenmorangie; I'm not a huge fan of the base flavor, but when you give it a finishing barrel it softens things up around the edges. 
This particular one is aged 12 years solely in sherry oak casks. It's got a really nice silky mouthfeel and the sherry places nicely with the malted flavors."

4.75,A friend of mine bought a bottle of 18yr Macallan and I was lucky enough to get a pour! I think I was just as happy to sit and smell the dram as I was to imbibe. I can’t afford the 18yr but decided to pick up a bottle of the 12. I have had it on occasion when I have been out but it is nice to add to the collection to have when you need a great scotch. Cheers! 🥃

3.0,"Nose has notes of dried fruit and a hint of pipe tobacco. Dried fruit with a gentle sweetness on the palate, followed by a fruity and spicy finish. I don’t find it all that remarkable, I prefer more “in your face/volatile” flavors, and aside from the spicy finish nothing really stands out. It’s still very good though, not my first choice but definitely worth the price."
4.0,"A sweet and savory dram suitable for any and every occasion! 

Nose: honey/sherry sweetness, light pleasant spice.

Palate: sugar, almost like honey, sherry, and molasses had a baby. Fresh fruits and nuts.

Finish: spice only on the swallow. Sweet, decently bog finish, with nuts and fruit staying longest.

A true crowd pleaser!

3.75,"Very Nice, good sherry whisky"
4.25,"Macallan 12 sherry oak should be your standard sherry wiskey or your bar right in the centre to compare everything else.

On the nose obviously you will get this beautiful sherry dry fruit notes that you will get everywhere else who ever use the same cask.
But here is the difference, you are not getting any bourbon candy sugary notes like the other. You still get your sugary notes on the nose but not sickly all over the place.
It's unlike tomintoul 12 where it's sherry overload with nothing else. Unlike strathisla 12 where it has this additional beautiful floral smell. Macallan 12 sherry oak cask is just simple but done well, but not simple as in single note. You do get complex notes in there.

On the palate you get all your dry fruit sherry notes with a little bit of lemon zest and wood spicy bitterness notes. Just a little bit there to add a complicity of the whisky and prepare for your next sip."

5.0,"This scotch has a fruity, sweet tone.  There is a definite peat flavor but is not as pronounced as most single malts.  To my tastes, it should be taken without water or ice but many use a drop or two of water.  I would not.  The flavor of sherry and oak are inviting to the palate.  It is never oily but has a dimension of that flavor.  This is my ""go to"" scotch by which I measure other scotch whiskey.  Certainly a highland standout!"

3.25,"What better way to cleanse the palate of overpriced, industrial-grade cleaning solvent than with some luxurious, debatably-overpriced Macallan?

Macallan’s core range got a makeover in 2018. The Macallan 12 Year Old Sherry Oak Cask is aged exclusively in European Sherry oak. It uses no American oak, in contrast to the 12 Year Old Double Oak (American + European oak) and leaves out the ex-bourbon casks featured in the 12 Year Old Triple Cask. It’s also refreshingly presented with its natural color at 43% ABV. 

Nose: Sweet honey and chocolate. Vanilla, bits of ginger spice, and dried figs ride an assortment of chocolate and fruity aromas. I find Macallan noses to be a bit mild-mannered and subdued, but it’s a pleasant nose nonetheless. 

Palate: Fruity and sweet (of the red and dark, dried fruit variety). Figgy. Cassia bark and ginger. Not quite as rich and full-bodied as I want to be based in the nose. Lots of chocolate (right around the 50% cacao variety) and tannic oak. A bit of cream, but not enough to fill out the palate fully. The mouthfeel of the tannins is nice, but not as nice as I find the Double Cask tannins to be. 

Finish: Medium length, with creamy chocolate, followed by spice and rounded, drying oak tannins. The oak definitely fills the majority of the finish and trails off a bit bitterly. 

In this instance, I find the exclusive use of European oak to be a bit too tannic and bitter for my liking, and (shocker!) I actually think I prefer the Double Cask to the Sherry Cask. Why? Neither of them are impressive to me - the Sherry Cask seems a bit over-oaked (read: bitter) and the Double Cask is so plain/vanilla ice cream/mashed potatoes (read: very close to sleep-through-it boring). But, the mouthfeel and tannic quality on the Double Cask is actually quite impressive to me (and frankly, the only thing that stands out).  So I think the Double Cask wins here, particularly in the VFM category, but that’s not saying much. 

Side note: while this may not seem like a very natural head-to-head comparison, I put the Macallan Sherry Cask up against anCnoc 12 (I was curious to compare two equally-aged, sweet and fruity malts but with different casks makeups; i.e. European oak v. American and Spanish oak). Results? The Macallan Sherry Cask served the purpose of making the anCnoc 12 more interesting while the (European) Sherry Oak diminished. The caramelly smokiness of anCnoc 12 became even more prominent and enticing while the Sherry Cask seemed more bitter.  So, this serves to reaffirm that a less prestigious bottle of anCnoc 12 is a better purchase for me than the Macallan 12 Sherry Oak Cask. I give this a 3.25 based on its overall profile and a nod to its pedigree, but if I was taking cost into consideration, I would score it lower. I was lucky this bottle was “on sale”. 

3.25 ~ 79 ~ Average"

4.5,"This Macallan has a wonderful aroma full of dried fruit, cola, and chocolate. I even get a hint of buttered popcorn. Which may be strange, but somehow blends well with the other rich smells. 

Palate is sweet with complex spices that change while on your tongue. A couple drops of water bring out more spices. 

The spices fade as you swallow leaving a sweet desert flavor in your mouth which may be too sweet for some, but I don’t think it’s overwhelming or bad. 

This whisky certainly taste more mature than other 12 year old scotches, perhaps due to the quality of Macallan’s casks. A very enjoyable scotch which can be recommended to new or experienced scotch drinkers."

4.25,"The color is an amber orange and the legs are slow to appear and slow to walk down.  The nose is just fantastic and can be appreciated from a foot away from the glass. There are apricots, raisins, toast and cereal malt all playing back-and-forth at the same time.  

The power is so incredibly smooth. There’s a balance of oak, Honey and dried fruits.  A little bit of salty ocean spray comes across on the backend along with a subtle warmth but never a burn or a bite. There is definitely more whiskey than Sherry.  I can’t help but feel a bit undeserving of this dram.

The pallet is so incredibly smooth and full of Honey, Oak and dried fruits."

4.25,"Back to back with the Glendronich 12 I will say this. The GD12 is delivering more from the standpoint of a sherried scotch with the juicy fruity notes engulfing the delightful experience. There is something about Macallan that makes it unique, sets it apart. The specialization of the barley and the cut and the barrels etc. You are onboard or youre not..Im in 100%. I love this and the other Macallans Ive tried. The nose, palate and finish are familiar and close to the double cask12 as well as the 15 with rich thick texture and maltiness but the sherry fruit notes are cranked up. The malt and fruit sweetness lasts throughout as well without typical drying tannic notes. Overall its a magnificent single malt imo and worth the $58 I paid all day. Yes Macallan has a little heat to it and lacks in smoke but they have delivered such a balanced and flavorful product that the claims of overpriced don't hold water for me. Wonderful scotch......93/100"

3.5,"I figured I'd get one of the old boxes (just not the brand new black box, nothing OLD) before they were hard to get. I've never been a huge fan, but as I explore more whisky sometimes you change.

Nose - toffee, vanilla, light milk chocolate, and some dark fruits. Much more dessert than sherry fruit flavors. I've never knocked on macallan for poor quality on the nose. I guess some ginger (there's spice and I know macallan always says ginger and I can't tell if I get that or if I'm just following their lead as they think sherry adds it to every bottle they make)

Taste - Well this is rich and complex, sherry gives off chocolate, pudding, toffee, vanilla, so much complexity and despite the 43% the mouth feel is killing it. 

I need to get a glendronach 12 year to do side by side but I'm honestly thinking I need more of these old bottling. Anyone know a way to date these? This bottle is far far better than anything else I've had in terms of MaCallan's 12 year's. 

Man I love to hate on these guys and they put out plenty of awful for the price whisky but this old bottling is awesome. Anyone know if you can date a 12 year? This store was selling a 1995 18 year before it sold so this could be oldish. I seriously don't recall my last 12 year being this rich in flavor."

4.0,"It's Macallan, meaning it works as advertised every time. Not the most adventurous stuff in the world, but always a good pour. Sherry oak casking is very strong on the nose. The palate confirms the nose, with plenty of spice, tobacco, and pepper to go along with it. Pepper lingers at on the finish, but fades as the trademark sherry oak dominates. Manifestly not a peat bomb. Very smooth throughout. If you want a good, reliable single malt for almost any mood or occasion, you could do far worse than this."

The whisky ends on a dry medium long finish with some tobacco, leather and oak.
Summary: This is a staple for a good reason. It's the benchmark of a well balanced entry level sherry whisky that's all I have to say about it (except, that it might be a terrific dram with 46% ABV!)"

Palate: lots of Sherry, Sweet, gentle spices, Smooth with no alcohol burn
Finish: some lingering spice and sherry again. Hint of dry Wood at the backend. Not getting any toffee i Keep seeing in other tasting notes.

Thoughts: it's a bit simple, really it's mostly sherry notes the whole way through with nothing to make it stand out. Did not Enjoy the nose that much. The whole experience is consistent though and it is pretty Smooth, i can see why this is a Good beginner whiskey. The Price does not seem justified in the end."

4.25,"Fantastic Dram. Although it is inferior for me, compared to my all time favorite Royal Salute, or Johnnie XR, this one disputes the third place with Hibiki Harmony.

On the nose you get dried fruits, almonds maybe, oakyness and a lot of wood smoke.

On the palate starts sweet like caramel but rapidly turns hot, very very hot and spicy, with a medium smoky finish which is awesome. 

Great experience"

0.5,"Well, this is my first taste of a Macallan.  I have a bottle of Macallan Rare Cask that I've not yet opened (as it was bought for my birthday) and bought this as a kind of test to see what delights I'm in for.  My palate and smell isn't the most honed, and although I have a very sensitive sense of smell, I can rarely pick out the different flavours that get mentioned - I just like what I like.  'Sherry Bomb' is a phrase that's bandied around a lot at the moment if you watch any whisky videos on Youtube, with dried fruits and raisins cropping up a lot with sherry-casked whiskies. Well, with this Macallan even I can smell the fruits, the nose doesn't so much fill the glass as whack you round the face with a bunch of grapes.  The nose is actually more potent than the palate for me and makes for a whiskey that defies it's 12 years of age.  Never had anything like it.  I tried it alongside a Glenlivet 18 - just for random comparison - and the Glenlivet is quite bland next to the Macallan (For 'bland' read 'subtle').  However, Is it worth twice the price of many other 12-year-olds? Well, not for me at the moment. I'm in talks with Macallan as I'm not sure I've not got a duff bottle. After a few tastes, the strong sherry aroma gives way to a slightly rotten fruit smell, quite pungent, but it's the aftertaste I'm struggling with. Long after drinking you're left with a definite sulphurous undertone that is akin to the taste you get in your mouth before norovirus... and it's quite unsettling. I was still getting hints of rotten egg long into the night. Macallan assured me that suphur isn't used at all in the process, but is a problem you can get with sherry casked whiskies. I'll update once I hear from them again, but they're being very slow.

UPDATE:  Well I heard back from Macallan and apparently ""there is no information from this batch that would suggest there is an untoward level of sulphurous notes. ""  This is very disappointing indeed as I now have no intention of drinking my beautiful rare cask so will sit on it for a few years and then sell it to make my money back.

How anyone can drink this stuff is beyond me, I find it completely unpalatable."

3.0,"Scents of Vanilla and caramel, with interesting herbal notes and a dash of salt. The sherry cask is present on the nose but not aggressive or overly sweet. However, after resting a  bit in the glass a prominent maple syrup and cranberry note pushes through. The taste is quite  mellow. Raisins, cashews and ginger on the palate. This whisky is not rich in flavor but rather in its texture. It’s silky, lingering and has a finish that pockets itself in one’s cheeks. It’s a nice, elegant whisky but with a reputation that is a tad inflated based on this dram."
