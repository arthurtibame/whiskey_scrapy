5.0,Full of character.. the first sip woke me up like a slap in the face. It keeps going too with the fruity vanilla and a hint of peat. Factor in the bargain proce of $80AUD and you got good all-round smooth whisky that culminates a perfectly balanced fine-tuned drop.
4.0,Loved the original Starward - but love this even more!

5.0,"Easily one of my all time favourites.  This whisky brings something uniquely Australian to the table.  The beautiful Barossa shiraz casks have given such depth and flavour to the whisky.  I love, love, love it!"

4.0,"Strong on the nose with banana and vanilla. On the palate it's smooth, got some spice  with the wine characteristics present. The finishing rounded and nice."
4.0,Best Australian single malt whisky 2016. It's an unique style of new world whisky. Must try and get one bottle while you can before they run out.

3.5,"Nose: Caramel, butterscotch, wine, floral and citrus notes. Some cherry and berry aromas.

Palate: Sweet toffee arrival, as it develops the sweetness recedes and is balanced by a pleasantly soft but tannic dryness and some mild peppery-anise notes. Red fruits, grapes, plums – fruity but not overly winey.

Finish: A medium finish – dry, fruity and nutty with a faint touch of spices.

The nose is brighter than that of the solera expression. It also seems more balanced and textured with a dry rather than sweet profile. Like all Starward whiskies this is somewhere between bourbon and scotch in character. It takes you a little while to wrap your head around this. I'd suggest just pouring a dram and relaxing with it with no preconceptions or expectations. If you set out to compare it (or any Australian whisky) with scotch whisky or bourbon you'll be disappointed. You need to give it time to speak for itself.

The relatively short maturation is entirely in Australian ex-shiraz barrels, and this imparts a robust and pleasantly dry character.  It’s a more complex and interesting whisky than the solera expression and repays patient tasting.  Good competent whisky.

“Good” : 3.5 stars"

4.0,"Almost port-like dessert wine aroma with amazing mouth feel. Can definitely taste the oaky barrels, and is reflected in the incredible caramel colour. Not as good on the rocks or with water, drink it neat"
3.5,Nose bit artificial like shampoo. Translates to palate which is like red wine cordial. Not bad but a bit odd and artificial. 3.5
