3.25,"Not an amazing whiskey but done fairly well. I love the port finish. This is just okay.

Where the port is balanced nose to finish I feel the cognac drives this whiskey with the Rye fighting it's way on the edges.

Nose is light with some spice and Andes mint chocolate and leathery fruit on the edges. The heat becomes apparent on the back.

Palate is all winery/tannic fruit with a light licorice/anise and peppery Rye. 

The finish continues with stewed fruit then a rye and baking spices that continues into a drying long finish. 

The proof is evident in the first few sips but smoothens out after about 2. Opens nicely with a drop of water."
