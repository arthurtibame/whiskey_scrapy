2.0,"Have to admit that I find this stuff downright unpleasant; in addition to being pretty gimmicky (distillers have been ""sweating the barrels"" for many years; the process JB uses here is hardly unique), the flavour profile is just a mess. Tastes like a cheap, half-hearted step-brother to Knob Creek. Flavours of peanut butter Beam funk, cinnamon, vanilla, and a shit-ton of oak. Barrel char, dry oak, leathery, tobacco. Hints of cherry, maybe. Surprisingly thin and hot in the mouth, very bitter, and very tannic."

Not to strong smelling and not that strong of a kick, a lot of the flavor is masked by the intensity of the heat; which is then followed by a hint of smoke flavor. I had to taste multiple times before I could taste what appeared to be (very slight) honey taste. For the price, it could be better but I won't complain too much.

3.0,"This was out at a friend's as a mixer. When the best part of the whiskey is that it makes you think of the commercials with Mila Kunis, then you know you're in trouble. It's not bad per se, but I'd stop well short of calling it good. It's bourbon purgatory, basically - enough Beam funk, vanilla, and caramel to be palatable, but a little too simple, one-note, and rough around the edges. I'd put it in a mixed drink if there weren't anything more interesting around, but it's nothing I'm ever going to crave."

2.5,"As many have pointed out, the ""woodyness"" is extremely in your face with this pouring, which comes as no surprise at all when you read how it was produced. 
    
    My personal observations are the aforementioned oak, some traditional Beam spice qualities with the full proof heat.  It's not bad its just not what a lot of experienced bourbon connoisseurs are out looking to find in a traditional style bourbon.   A lot of people seem to have love-hate with this one in they either find the extreme earthy wood notes desireable or not much at all, I've seen a few people begging for this in smaller bottes than the standard 750.   One thing is the uniqueness of the process and  blend that makes it a ""must try"" for any adventourous bourbon enthusiest to try what we all imagine is still ""hiding"" in the barrel after pourings.  After all,  most drinkers won't be offended by oak and are going to notice some unique hints in the engrained barrel flavorings, though some of that additional flavor is on the rougher side, still, at such a nice price point there just is no reason to not to take this girl out for a spin on the dance floor."

4.0,"One of my wife's two picks on a recent flight, so I got to try it.  The marketing hype for this bourbon, which included ads with Mila Kunis, instantly made me skeptical it could be any good in the glass.  But, what do I know, it's actually a pretty great whiskey and a powerful oak monster.  Firewood, kindling, bark, new-made furniture -- starting to get the picture? -- dominate the nose and palate.  In the background I detect only a bit of corn, some syrup, and maybe some capers providing a little seasoning.  The finish is sweet and mellow, right?  Of course not, it's oak again, like the third act of the trilogy.  I loved the clear expression of woody flavor, but the drink is a little unbalanced as a result, as there isn't enough of a complement to those notes, particularly on the tongue.  The tannic bitterness also can be a bit much on some sips.  But if you'd given this to me blind, you easily could have convinced me I was tasting an old-in-the-tooth bourbon that had just tipped over a bit into the overoaked realm.  Very unique profile at its price point."

3.0,"The nose has a lot of oak and alcohol scent, with a hint of sweetness. I wasn't too impressed, but the palate turned out to be better than the nose. Lots of oak and spiciness, almost like a rye whiskey instead of a bourbon. Sweet caramel and vanilla were hinted at on the back end and the finish was long and warming. Overall I can see myself buying this in a rotation on my bottom shelf, but not really a must have. More like something interesting when I want a little different but don't want to spend a lot."

3.0,"Mini-bottle Battle: Jim Beam Black Extra Aged vs. Jim Beam Devil's Cut vs. Rebel Yell

Devil's Cut edges out Black with Rebel Yell in a distant third."
3.5,null
3.75,"Jim Beam Devil’s Cut is Beam’s second attempt at an “extra oaky” bourbon, with their Double Oak being the other expression.  While I thought the Double Oak fell a little flat in the “extra oak” game for me with frankly too little extra oak flavors, I am hopeful that Devil’s will fulfill that overly oaky bourbon at an attractive price point.  I do rather enjoy an extra oaky expression at times, so I’m curious how well Devil’s can accomplish its aspirations here.  For those curious about the technical difference in Beam’s Devil’s Cut and Double Oaked, the DO takes standard Beam and ages it a second time in new charred oak barrels, likely less than a year I estimate.  Devil’s on the other hand utilizes a rather unique technique in the bourbon world, by extracting the remaining juice from within the barrel wood itself (hence the Devil’s Cut name) and adding it back to what they call “extra aged” bourbon.  Does this process really create a uniquely oaky bourbon or just a marketing spin?  Let’s find out!

Enjoyed neat in a Glencairn, no water added.  On the nose, I am immediately greeted with a sweet maple and toasted new wood scent on top of alcohol and a bit of vanilla.  Not the most interesting, rich, or complex nose for sure, but the extra wood scent is certainly present and accounted for, so I'll take it!  It’s by no means an oak monster or anything though, but I would (or wood) say there is more of a oaky character on the nose here than the Double Oaked expression, so win on the nose to Devil’s.  

On the palate, I am greeted with more maple and an initial high spicy kick of cinnamon, with a little warmth, followed by a toasty wood backbone, and maybe some light vanilla and caramel trying to get through all the spice and oak.  There is also the signature Beam nuttiness in the background.  The taste starts pleasantly sweet but actually quickly turns more tart and astringent, likely from the additional oaky tannins released from deep in the wood in their extraction process. The Double Oak, by comparison, offers the more traditional bourbon flavors of sweeter caramel and vanilla than Devil’s, but less of the oaky spicy qualities.  Again, I wouldn’t call Devil’s an oak bomb by far, but the process of deep extraction certainly has left a mark on the palate.  The palate isn’t very complex or deep and definitely places emphasis on the oak tannins and the extra qualities imparted by it, like the enhanced spiciness and astringency.  I’ll call a tie between this and the Double Oaked for flavors.  The Devil’s does have more wood presence, but the DO has a little richer slightly sweeter bourbon flavors.  They are both aiming to accomplish something fairly similar but the end result is definitely different on the palate.  I can’t really say which I’d prefer more, except to say that Beam’s own Distiller’s Cut absolutely kills either of them in flavors for roughly the same price!  

The finish is fairly short but again it reminds of its wood forward nature, surprise!  It's toasted new wood, a little bit of vanilla and maple sweetness, and a very faint tobacco and char note.  Hey, I do like the wood flavors in a bourbon, so the slightly wood forward finish is alright by me, even if it isn’t very rich or lasting.  

Overall, I’d say Devil’s is a worthwhile sip if you are strictly looking for a bit of enhanced woodiness to your drink.  Other than the enhanced woody character though, it really doesn’t offer anything outstanding, complex, or different even from other Beam expressions.  Honestly, I’d skip the Devil’s and Double Oak and go straight to their Distiller’s Cut, which as far as I’m concerned is the best bourbon Beam makes that actually says Beam on the bottle.  I really don’t find a compelling reason to buy Devil's unless you are super keen on trying it from a technical point of view in how they extract the juice from the wood and the effect on the bourbon flavor.   Even then though, there are other (non-Beam) bourbons without all the fancy processes that possess just as tasty, or even more so, woody quality while retaining great bourbon flavor in the process.  So in the end I have to call Devil’s a bit more marketing than substance, which is also how I felt about their Double Oak.  I realize for a low $20 bourbon you’re not going to get a boutique super high quality oak monster with outstanding depth, complexity, and richness.  That’s why Knob Creek exists I think.  But even in the mid $20 range there are great choices with far greater character or complexity or even more wood presence depending on what you like.  In this price class, my favorites are easily Wild Turkey 101, Beam’s Distiller’s Cut, Buffalo Trace, or even Bulleit.  Each are very different but offer far greater bang for your bourbon buck!  Sure Devil's is better than standard JB White and certainly has a much cooler name and story, but that's a pretty low bar to surpass anyhow in the Beam family.  Cheers!"

2.75,"The nose is just as subtle as the original Jim Beam, with a hint of cinnamon candy. The palate is more interesting though: all of its flavor is present in the entry, and remains like a viscous mixture,dry and spicy, buoying up the sweeter notes. What are those notes? Choose any bourbon and strip away everything that makes it interesting.

There is an obvious overall increase in heat, char, and spice going into the finish, which lasts much longer than the original, and is a lot more drying. Not sure how much of this is from the higher ABV, and how much involves the secret barrel voodoo, but it makes for a marginally better bourbon either way. I used the rest of this in a hot toddy whilst sick, and it's pretty good for that."

Taste: The taste has its corn and vanilla sweetness as should be expected but with the addition of heavy wood notes (which makes sense due to the nature of this bourbon) and Hot Tamales candy leaving behind an almost acidic / bitter aftertaste and finish with almost a grape skin tartness toward the end of the glass.

Opinion: When you are a top name in your particular industry, the more (I would think) you would want to play it safe with your products. However, the creativity found in this whiskey has to be admired! Great work thinking outside the box, Jim Beam! So, it's not bad. It's not the best either though. It would probably make a solid mixer for a number of cocktails but it really wasn't my favorite dram to have neat. I love the creativity, but it's not a go-to for me. Cheers!"

Of course it's heavy on the oak, but it's more complex than I expected. Nice peppery burn on the finish, leaving an earthy oak on the palate. Where this one earns its keep is on the rocks. With a little ice melt it becomes almost honey butter sweet in both taste and texture. The oak hangs around in the background. Short sweet finish, with limited to no burn. Leaves a nice sweet coating on the palate. For me, this is not a complicated sipper, but...Come home from work hot and tired, fill a small rocks glass with ice and Devils Cut, and relax. It also performed very well in an Old Fashioned. For me this slots above the Standard White Label, equal to the Black Label, and below the Double Oak and Distiller's Cut in the Beam labeled lineup."

2.75,"Has some good kick. Good liquor to mix with coke. That's about it. On the rocks is decent but once you drink higher $$$ bourbon it's just not the same. 

It's got a smokey flavor and some spice."

3.0,Consistently colored like most mass produced whiskey. Aroma is surprisingly pleasant. Some nice floral notes with pepper in the background. The pepper really comes through in the taste as well as a touch of smoke. Finish is very mild. A touch of water brings out some sweetness and really provides some balance.
3.25,"Not bad, much improved over Jim. 

Nose - lots of oak, vanilla, brown sugar

Taste - sweet with a LOT of barrel

Finish - lasts for days and has a good burn."

2.75,"I enjoy Beam black and Distillers cut is ok too so thought id give this a go. Poured neat, nose is strong barrel wood with dusty spice, leather, cedar chips and mild vanilla. Better than average mouthfeel and nice warming heat. Palate kicks in with smooth cola and vanilla custard (like Beam Black) with plenty of barrel and char to balance it out. Expected oak fest so im pleasantly surprised. Finish is good with lingering spice, oak and cola. Overall its very similar to Black with a slight uptick in proof. Both are solid tasty bourbons that are well worth purchasing under $20. They have that Beam/Old Crow spice that I like and don't go too far with the oak maintaining balance. Id give the edge to Beam Black as its more rounded with better depth. This Devils Cut is a tad drier with more barrel and heat but is still solid.......80/100.......I know I sound like a broken record but EW BIB is superior for less $$. This and Black at least give a different profile though"

4.0,"An interesting expirimental whiskey by Jim Beam, though you have to love the taste of wood in order to appreciate it. This is definitely one of the most woody whiskeys I've ever tasted. There are also notes of caramel, honey and cinnamon, but the wood taste is definitely more dominant. I consider this a 'cult' whiskey; you either love it or hate it. For the price though, it's a great value and you get a bourbon with an interesting backstory."

2.5,This is just burning. It’s very alcoholic on the nose. The taste has some vanilla and wood with some sweetness from corn but with too much burn to really appreciate it. I used most of it as a mixer instead of neat.

3.25,"Nose - peanuts, caramel, heavy oak, brown sugar, toffee, chocolate-covered orange, moderate ethanol burn. 

Taste - peanuts, burnt brown sugar, chocolate, oak, caramel, finishing with a fairly young alcohol bite and a toffee/milk chocolate/peanut brittle flavor.

I think this definitely punches above its price class, but I’m partial to the Beam funk."
3.25,"Jim Beam did a number on this whiskey. Alcohol and burnt sugar on the nose. On the palate, it’s Jim Beam cranked up with lots of burn and lots of intense spiciness with a touch of vanilla.  It may not be an everyday sipper but a solid mixer — or for those crappy nights where liquid courage is needed."
