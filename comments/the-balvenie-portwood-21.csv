4.0,"There's a lot going on with this whisky: I get florals, spices, faint vanilla, maybe a trace of nuttiness in the nose.  On the palate, a fruit mix, spices, wine notes, some nuts; an incredible array of flavors that frankly I can't fully sort out.  Finishes medium to long, soft and semi sweet.  A wonderful whisky!  It's not a 5 star in my book, but it's a solid 4  1/2."

5.0,"Overall one of the best scotch you can taste. The portwood finishing gives the right complexity and flavour. It always leaves my mouth sweet and my head happy. The price, even though is still in the affordables, went on a little too high (in europe you can find it for nearly 130 euros)"

Some hazelnut and apples. And chocolate. That sort of chocolate that makes you discover why chocolate is conaidered to be an aphrodisiac. Some leather and cigar. If Pamela Anderson of Baywatch was a hardcore biker. And the taste? Oh it's perfect. It taste like you've been given access to an ancient secret wall and fed a million years old book in a form of humanity's first ever lump of magic chocolate. And then some woodskin and dried fruit. Wow."

4.0,"Balvenie Is always a fail safe.  Never too adventurous ( think those funky casks from Edradour) or too stale.  Can't ever go wrong with a Balvenie.  This is a great malt----aromas of ripe fruit and honey, followed by chocolate and dark berries.  Long lingering smooth finish.  Key question:  can you get something similar for less?  This is pricey.   I think you can---if you especially try non-Scottish malts or American whiskey.  As good as this is---for me personally...either I'd fork up an extra $100 and get a Balvenie Tun, or I'd save myself a $100 and get a Hibiki 17 or Yoichi 15."

The dark fruit notes play well with the more refined flavors and don't outstay their welcome. I'd need to try more than the wee dram I had today in the presence of master distiller David Stewart before I could mark this five stars, but I wouldn't question the potential."

Was in my top couple of drams out of the nearly 100 I tried over 5 days. I have another sample so it will be interesting to see if it holds up rating wise. Update 1 year later: Right take 2 on the sampling. Is it as good? Almost, definitely better than the 16 year Triple Cask. Probably not a 4.5 but definitely 4.25."

4.0,"* Sydney Balvenie whisky tasting night, 26 April 2018. Whisky #4.

Nose: The classic Balvenie dusky floral orange and honey nose appears here in a more mellow form. The orange note has almost completely transformed into apricot, peach and stewed plums, and the honey has softened into a velvety curtain.  The port presence is restrained and elegant, giving the nose a lift of red grape and cherry aromas. The Balvenie vanilla is also present however this time it’s not vanilla flowers, but more like the smell of warm Portuguese pastéis de nata.

Palate: A lush, sweet arrival with plums and berries is balanced by a malty note that saves it from being cloying. In the development there are cherries, raisins, honey, hazelnuts, dark Belgian chocolate and vanilla cream, but all very subdued and soft.

Finish: Medium. A fruity chocolate/vanilla dream that fades in the most gentle and gradual manner imaginable.

I’m always a little cautious with port or madeira finishes as the result can too often become a grotesque caricature. Sherry is somehow easier to manage and combines well with most distillates (PX can be surprisingly wonderful with heavily peated expressions), but other fortified wines can be a risk. However if there is anyone who can pull it off it’s Balvenie’s David Stewart.

The result here is a very fine whisky that is all about velvety-soft subtlety. Seductive sweet fruity notes are layered with just enough complexity to add interest but keep the story straightforward and eminently approachable.

The port finish avoids any obvious wine presence and instead contributes fruity notes and a muting of the the oak tannins. This is how port should be used – not as a simple flavouring but as a finishing agent – like giving a final polish with the finest grade of jewellers’ rouge.

I enjoyed this whisky a lot but I can understand how other palates might find it too restrained and laid-back, and it is rather expensive. I liked it enough to buy a bottle at the tasting, but I don't think I'll replace it once it's finished.

“Very Good” : 4 stars"

null,"Review #11 of 12 from DC Whiskyfest 2018. I was only able to do 12 because I came down with something that afternoon that really messed with my head and stomach. I should have just stayed in the hotel room but I didn’t pay $350 for VIP tickets to sample my pillow!
No scores for anything sampled as I don’t think it would be fair.

Soft and sweet nose. Strawberry Jolly Ranchers, honey and a light spice. 

Spices but mild on the palate, oak and weak port notes if any. 

This was probably the biggest disappointment of the night for me next to the Laphroaig epic fail."
null,"** Disclaimer:  This review is what I would consider a “Quick Hit”- meaning I won’t have my usual in-depth notes that I usually like to take.  The reason:  this sample was poured at Whiskyfest DC on 4/17/18.  All of these reviews will not be scored and I am actively looking to try them again at some point to do them more justice.

This sample has to slide over into the disappointing column of my Whiskyfest list because I was completely expected to be blown away and I wasn’t.  It didn’t seem as complex or as smooth as it should’ve been.  The port notes didn’t come through (could’ve been my palate beginning to get fatigued) and it seemed rather harsh for a Balvenie AND 21 years old.  I have a bottle of this one sitting here at home so I will be looking to redeem this one because there are just too many great reviews of it for it to be as low as I would’ve scored it based on Whiskyfest alone.

Also, boo to the Balvenie reps for being so stingy with the pours.  Especially with the 21 being a non-VIP pour.  A little over a 1/4oz (maybe) wasn’t worth standing in line for.  They also short poured the Peat Week during the VIP hour, but that was a fantastic malt- more to come on that one."

5.0,"was at the old alma mater this week conducting on campus interviews for work, which was a good excuse to try some new whiskies. Last night, our recruiting team dined at a restaurant with a $100 per person minimum. After ordering food, the waiter informed us that we were still well below our minimum, so I decided to do my part. For the Firm, of course. For my final drink, I went with something that I hoped could serve as dessert whisky to cap off the evening.

Age: 21 years

Abv: 43%

Nose: Surprisingly big for being in a tumbler. It smells like, well, port, accompanied by some rich nutty and dried fruit aromas. (23/25 points)

Taste: More port. More nuts. Some oak shows up, as well as what I’ll call Coca Cola. Big and rich, the mouthfeel is fairly thick for something with only a 43% ABV. (45/50 points)

Finish: Medium length. Pretty much just a continuation of what came before, with perhaps a little honey as it fades away. (21/25) points)

Conclusion: Tastes like desert in a bottle, which is what I was going for. Balvenie did a good job importing port flavors without overpowering the whisky, and the end result is a solid dram that is sweet without being overly so. That being said, this isn’t worth the price. I don’t know how much this particular pour cost, but I’ve seen this for around $200, and you can buy a lot of good whisky for that amount. As such, I’d gladly drink this if offered, but I would not purchase my own bottle.

4.5,"And so it begins, the anual tradition of a customized advent calendar. Made sure everything I put into it was available on Distiller, but have no idea anymore what I put into it. This is gonna be interesting. 

Day 1 we start strong, the Balvenie Port has been on my list for a very long time. Port finish is probably one of my favorites. 

The nose starts with sweet raisins, milk chocolate and some baking spices. Perfect for the season to be honest.

This continues on the taste with the same chocolate note dominating, while the raisins turn into all sorts of dark fruits and the spices get a bit blunted by a very distinct honey note. They still add that bit of oompf to the mix that prevents this from becoming a overly sweet mess. 

The finish is sweet spices and chocolate, plus a bit of warmth. This one would fit very nicely in front of a fireplace while watching the snow fall. It isn't quite a five star, and I really doubt any non peated whisky will ever reach a full five with the new quarter points available, but it is very close and a great start into my least favorite season of the year. Just not a christmas person, but I could get used to the idea of ""a sample a day"". 

This is one of the higher priced whiskys that I would actually buy. 175 is a fair and appropriate price for it. If you like sweeter whisky that is,"

2.5,"It’s time to revisit a dram I had a pour of back at Whiskyfest DC in April 2018:  Balvenie 21 Port Wood.  I didn’t pay much attention nor ask questions at the festival as to whether the bottle they were pouring from was the diluted 40% or the elevated one.  I was pretty disappointed with it so I’m going to assume it was the weaker one.  I had a bottle at home and hoped to give it a more thorough turn, even though my bottle was also the 40% variety.

Flash forward 9 months and I decided to go ahead and crack this expensive, well aged Balvenie.  It’s a deep gold in the taster with watery, wide legs and medium droplets left behind on the rim.  The color doesn’t really give much indication of port barrel finishing either.  Huh.

The nose is predominantly honey and sherry cask, harsher oak tones and very little port sweetness.  Having tried this over the course of two months I’ve let it breathe to different lengths of time and couldn’t detect much of a change from 5 minutes out to over half an hour.

The palate does deliver on the port characteristics right out of the gate:  there’s grape must and simple sugar to the point it feels cavity-inducing.  The depth of the 21 year old juice is also apparent- there’s no harshness, although it does feel decidedly one-dimensional.  It’s watery and too sweet.  This is where I think one needs to try the stronger ABV bottle.  This needs more grunt.

The finish is medium and relatively mellow.  The grape-y, sugary-ness does linger but I don’t really want it to.  I really wanted some power, some oak, anything to remind me I’m drinking whisky.  Sadly, nothing materializes.

Overall, this 40% version is a poor example of what Balvenie is capable of.  I’ve had quite a few mediocre offerings from these guys and if you factor in the higher than most price point it’s a bust.  I paid $160 for this bottle and I know I could’ve found 2 bottles of some other port finished whisky that would’ve been significantly better.  Leave the 40% version on the shelf if you see it.  2.5 stars.  Cheers."

First sip: thin entry, thin fruit on the midpallet, a cornucopia of flavors on the finish, raisins, then peanut butter, followed by apricot. Post finish was mildly warm. A very interesting drink. Second sip: the same as the first, but I had a harder time distinguishing the flavors on the back of the pallet. Third sip: more of the same, and my favorite sip yet. This is a crazy interesting drink. Lots of fun, but I question whether it’s worth the steep premium price. I might buy a bottle to keep in the collection, but wouldn’t go out of my way to stock it."

4.0,"There’s a lot of controversy about this one. Some love it, some hate it, and it all seems to be stemming from the differences in the ABV: the weaker 40% vs the higher 47.6% sold at Duty Free. Well, turns out there’s a bottle at 43% in Costco, and it’s priced at $180. Not cheap, but for a 21-year-old dram, not exuberant either. The review below is about this 43% ABV version.

The bottle says nothing about artificial coloring or chill-filtration, so I assume it has both, although there’s probably not much sense in coloring the 21-year-old dram. Nevertheless, color is gold with a reddish hue, the dram is clear (it does look chill-filtered), and has medium viscosity.

Nose is delicate, doesn’t strike as old but is not that of a youthful dram either. Hints of ripe fruit, vanilla, and caramel, with a touch of chocolate and spice on the back. Palate is rich and full, with sweet notes of raisins, honey, spice, and some citrus and floral notes. Finish is rather long and vanilla-oaky, somewhat bitter, with hints of honey, overall quite pleasant. After some time with this dram, the port finish notes intensify but do not dominate - it is only finished in portwood. I keep hunting for oiliness that is often present in older drams, but can’t seem to find it. Hints of nuts (mostly almonds) and more ripe fruit start to appear, but the overall character remains the same.

A few drops of water do very little for this dram. In fact, I wouldn’t add it again. The character looses balance and focus and starts to be too fruity and sweet. It makes sense now that the 40% ABV version doesn’t score well, and I’m really curious about the potential for the 47.6% ABV.

Overall, this is a solid dram, but nothing mind blowing. If I haven’t seen the bottle, I wouldn’t have guessed it’s 21 years old. It’s nice, it’s complex, it’s smooth, it’s very much enjoyable, but I think you would probably get most of the same from a much cheaper 12 doublewood version."

4.0,"Rich, oily, entry, full-bodied, and very sweet with lots of port influence.  Nuttiness and floral notes transition to oak.  The finish is balanced, if not slightly bittersweet cacao, and gives way to the signature Balvenie sweet-malt flavor.  The texture going down is unique, and more akin to that of a thin pudding or custard.

The best of the Balvenie lineup, although the DW12 comes close for much less money."

3.0,"This has a stale taste like no other. It is smooth, a bit sweet, and a tad salty with distressing bread notes. There is some nutty oil and there are some mild red fruits, but that stale bread flavor is the strongest element here. There is not much smoke, but what I suspect to be wood feeds into the stale bread. A bit of orange is there and there is some spice too, but although the flavor is smooth and rounded, it isn't really tasty. Stunningly, there isn't much depth here either. Really, this tastes more like $12 Sherry than Scotch. Do avoid.
This taste comes right after the Bladnoch 25 Talia. The nose is drier, woodier, and less sweet. It has a nice malty smell to it though, but there's also a lot of floral notes with some light fruitiness and some tempered spices. It smells like a grassier, younger whiskey than it actually is. The palate is smooth with a clear flavor of gross bread. It's sweet and floral with some grassy, fruity flavors. There a definite sweet cherry notes along with the spices. It reminds me somewhat of A De Fussigny Selection and Symbole National. It tastes good enough even with the gross wood, but it's nowhere near justifying its price tag. Aside from the cardboard, the flavors are balanced and tasty. Still, I would find it easier to believe that this is a 12 year scotch than a 21 year. And aged in port wood? Ridiculous!"

5.0,"It's hard to believe that this has never seen a sherry barrel from the nose - the port comes through sharply, but the nose is very nutty - almonds and walnuts - these must come from the bourbon barrels.  The nose is quite powerful- I get red fruit, spice/char, hints of vanilla.

The port finish is very apparent- I get the sweet red port flavor up front but it is very well balanced.  The whiskey is very nutty and malty and is rounded out by the port.  There is wood and more port in the finish, as well as orange peel, pepper, and cloves.

This whiskey is very robust but the balance is perfect.  The strength of the port does not take over the whiskey.

This is very festive - I'd recommend it any time of the year, but it's particularly suited to fall, Thanksgiving and Christmas.  It'd make an excellent accompaniment to a special holiday meal, with dessert, or as dessert.  Just be ready to share it ;)"
