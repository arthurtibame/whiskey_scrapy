4.0,"Like a struck match but somehow smells like it is still ready to burn.  Incredibly warm like sitting beside a long burning fire but without the intensity of a fast burn.  Lifting your glass to taste the thick fluid still clings to the sides and your first taste reveals hints of spice, with loads of heavy esthers.  Not very noticeable bit slight hints of nuts, maybe tree nuts or almond buried deep within.  Delicious."

5.0,"Motherfucker. I promised i would not like this. 

But it’s lovely. Burnt matchsticks with butter and apples and pears. Burnt matchsticks as always. It all comes down to if you like that sulphur. I love this shit.

4.5,"The nose is very citrus and gentle, with an enveloping hint of wax pastels. Honey and vanilla caress the nose, opening the door to more fruity tones, of pineapple and mango, and sweet, almond nougat. Very elegant and harmonious.
On the palate it is slightly spicy, with cinnamon and a touch of pepper, increasing the fruity and tropical soul together with vanilla and honey wrapped in wax. Citrus fruits are always very bright and present, with a predominance of lemon, together with a herbaceous and balsamic touch on the background. Very pasty and rich, with a rhubarb note that creeps in the aromas and revives the experience, keeping it varied and engaging.
Long and balsamic finish, made of wax, lemon, rhubarb and wood.
Stratified and complex, elegant and almost austere, it takes time and concentration to grasp its facets, it is certainly not suitable for a distracted drink in its fiercely elitist essence."

4.5,"So I'm a big fan of this ""sulfur"" element per marketing notes. Like smoke but a little bit unique and different. Plus its strength was nicely balanced by thickness and boldness of the scotch. Fruity and with that smoke twist made for a great dram."
