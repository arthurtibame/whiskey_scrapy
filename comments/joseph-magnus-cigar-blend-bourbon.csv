5.0,Classic bourbon nose with that cognac coming through nicely. Spicy fruits on the taste with a lingering barrel sugar. Delicious.

4.75,"Batch #7, bottle #135. Chocolate, tobacco, leather nose--kinda harsh until rested. Palate is a fantastic ride! Beautifully sweet with a spicy start quickly fading into tobacco in the middle and a long, creamy orange finish. Some oak tannins in the finish, but just enough to make you want more! I have yet to try anything that really tops this bourbon!"
5.0,Best juice I’ve had. Tobacco and leather

4.75,Tobacco leather and musty books on the nose.  Almost smells like a cigar.  Great mouthfeel with sweetness and oak.  Not candy sweet but more burnt sugary sweet.   Long drawn out finish.  Man it’s long.  Very good pour.  This was batch 10.  This is a top ten for me personally.  Very good

4.0,"This is a great pour.  I tried it first with a natural Rocky Patel and while very good, I would suggest a few sips before lighting up to appreciate all this bourbon has to offer."
5.0,"just picked up batch #10 and have had the pleasure of tasting batches #6 and #8 . This stuff is nothing short of amazing , certain bible scriptures come to mind when reminiscing such as John 11:35 . ‘Jesus Wept’ , lol if you come across the cigar blend anywhere near the retail of $150 BUY IT!"

5.0,"Absolute fig and vanilla bomb with the perfect balance of heat and sweet 

10/10"
5.0,"Batch 10
BTL 2/529

Strong aromas of toffee, hazelnut, brûléed fig, apricot, and sweet tobacco upfront  while  cinnamon, oak, and leather linger on the enveloping nose. 

Super smooth. Starts out with spearmint, grape must, milk chocolate, and vanilla. Next comes the baking spices, cinnamon, anise, and some clove. Beautifully long finish. Before its had it's way with your tongue, the wonderful warmth of oak makes you come back for sip after sip. Not too tannic, (which is good for a cigar I'd imagine) with help from the finishing barrels. Wonderful balance in blending.

Not a cigar smoker anymore, but I might have to make an exception one day while enjoying this bourbon. 

What a dram."

4.25,"Wonderful!
Sweeter aromas of caramel red apples and soft baking spice. Very rich and full on the palate. Vanilla, orange, caramel, nutmeg all rolling around together. Really opened up with a touch of water. 
Can’t wait to keep drinking this!"
4.5,"Batch 12, excellent well balanced mgp. Oak leather tobacco and baking spice. Good mouthfeel and finish. Wanted to hate this because of the price but it's great"
4.0,"MGP. Leather, caramel, vanilla, citrus, molasses."
4.25,Batch 11
4.5,"Nose: chocolate, a little spice, a tiny bit of berry

Palate: sooo rich and sweet on the palate. Berries and more burnt chocolate. Some kind of bite that would shine through any pairing of cigar. Smoky almost second sip

Finish: smoke and chocolate but lightly done and it lasts for a while. Very impressed and very unique

You can tell this is a high end bourbon for real"

4.0,"From a 2 oz sample I had a few months back, notes written at the time.  Score provided based on notes.  Thank you to I whisky she wines for this sample.  

nose - cinnamon spices with maybe some pepper.  Cognac finishing without a doubt.  Tobacco – freshly dried leaves you’d smell in a barn.  If it weren’t a bourbon base I’m not sure I’d say vanilla and caramel but there is an underlying sweat note that’s more caramel in nature than raw sugar.  Water brings out the spices in greater amounts, even adds a bite to the nose.  Meanwhile the sugars and malts come
 down.  I’m now getting a very distinct older oak cherry notes which I absolutely love.  Tobacco is still there and the unmistakable cognac note is much subdued
 but still there.  I believe this is just cognac finished and I somewhat hope so as I don’t get the sherry, but if it is in there it doesn’t come out neat and with water has some elements that I could be convinced are sherry, but I don’t get sherry finishing on the blend...maybe a portion of this was sherry finished to just add a touch of fruity notes WAY back there.  At about an hour and a half in the glass, it’s gotten really sweat, spices have faded in both the sample with water and without. 

 Taste
 – Cognac.  This will sound odd but grape fruity notes on top of caramel, but
 more a grape candy that isn’t overly sweat.  Tobacco and cinnamon spices.  Water – wow just like the nose water opens things up wonderfully.  I even get more bite likely from the spices but it feels hotter (on the tongue, there's less heat as it
 goes down).  That more concentrated grape like note is gone.  Tobacco isn’t really a common note I mention, it’s often there on older bourbon but the cognac and older
 bourbon seems to be giving this is really nice impact.  I’d actually until I wrote this had forgotten the whole “cigar” part of the name.  I can absolutely see a real comparison, not that I’m a big cigar smoker, but I might do one a year.  Anyway, really nice sweet finish that I want on my bourbon.

Finish/body - Body is medium which is a touch disappointing but hardly negative.  the finish is medium long not giving me the older bourbon notes, but there's wood and spices still lingering well after the finish.  

I did a side by side with regular magnus and ultimately - they're different, they're both awesome, and I'm not sure which one I like more."
4.5,"Tobacco, oak forward"
