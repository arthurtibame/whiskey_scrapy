1.0,"Worldwide known as the worst whisky in the world, Fujikai 10yo is a bad dram, but not as near as the disgusting thing i have heard. Countless reviews put this one as something unbearable. It is bad, but because it has no flavor at all, but nothing really off-putting.

Bottled at 43%abv, only 8808 bottles were ever made. 

On the nose, it is weird. I have seen people talk about it like the aroma has a diesel /kerosene profile, but for me it was: Humid Clothes, wet socks, it feels like it tries somehow to be fruity, but fails and delivers a gasoline note. 

On the palate, it is nothing. It has no flavor. I don't know if the bar where i had it threw water on it, but it would make sense because it tastes like water, it has no flavor. Aftertaste is also very thin. Its like it tries to be peppery in some way, but it fails to do so. 

Overall it is not as bad as i thought, it really has no flavor and that is why it is bad. I believe that i have seen to many bad reviews and i expected it to be worse than what it really is. 20 over 100 and maybe i am been too good here. Avoid it."
