4.75,"The nose is hot like a barrel proof but the mouthfeel...I hate to use the term “smooth”, it’s like warm butter. Fatty and rich. When you get past the heat, the nose is graham cracker and a spice rack. The palate makes it clear this didn’t just sit in a charred American barrel. Highly enjoyable on itts own. Don’t have with a cigar. Just drink it and enjoy the spirit."
