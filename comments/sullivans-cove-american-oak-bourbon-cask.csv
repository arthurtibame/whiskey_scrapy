3.0,"Decent mild, everyday leisurely dram.  I'm not sure it's worth its price though.  Better bargains to be had at this price range, that offer more complexity and depth.  Go for it's cousin--French Oak.  Deeper and more character."
2.0,"Dr. Pepper on the nose, menthol, cough syrup on the tongue. Reminiscent of a tonic."

5.0,"You only have to look at the flavour profile to see what you are getting with this. Everything! It's pricey, at least here in Australia, but it's worth it. A noted whisky expert rated it liquid gold. It is. Take your time, add a teaspoon of water and enjoy. You won't be disappointed."

4.0,"Take 2 : had this at the distillery and as Sullivan’s cove batches do vary and my previous notes got taken by the Angels I must up this to a 4 for the bath I had - nice and rounded

What let’s it down is that it’s a touch pricey"
