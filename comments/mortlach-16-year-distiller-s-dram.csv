3.75,Smells like fruit cake. Tastes fruity and gets smoother with ice. Ice brings out gingerbread

3.5,"The nose is full of apple and honeyed, sticky fruits. Just a bit of brine mingling with baking spices (especially clove) lurked underneath the syrupy sweetness. Sherry cask finish is very evident here. The initial taste was extremely sweet, full of apple and honeyed raisins and dates. Just when I was thinking it was too sweet, the brine came back to keep it from going too far. The subsequent tastes featured the brine, which tamped down most of the honey to allow the mellow, dark notes to shine. A nice, peppery wood with the hard edges of those notes rounded off is the star now, with the baking spices being supported by what’s left of the honeyed, dark fruits. A spiced rum cake is presented on the finish, with the return of the syrupy sweet notes, and settles in for a long finish that fades into a nice, crisp apple."

4.25,"A much milder and less impressive nose compared to what it is to come. Hints of Sherry, spice and that signature meaty/sulphuric Mortlach character.

In mouth comes in waves. Sweet and oak spiciness/bitterness first. Growing in mouth with a lovely oil character and expanding with layers of spice, depth of toffee and Sherry sweetness.

Very long spicy warm and round finish.

Solid whisky."

4.0,"It’s a perfect spring whiskey. The nose is very floral, like a bouquet of spring flowers. The taste was quite hot with notes of mineral and brine. With water, it mellows out the taste but makes the nose harsher. The finish is long and sits in the bowl of the back of my tongue."
4.5,"Initially the nose shows a very caressing wax and wood soul, accompanied by sour cherry and pear. Clear presence of malt, together with leather, caramel and a touch of orange. A sweet profile diluted by a slightly rough side.
In the mouth it is warm and enveloping, fruity (red fruits, peach, pear) and waxy, with still a strong presence of malt and wood. Orange zest, a light pinch of spices (cardamom, cinnamon), pistachios, all very harmonious and balanced.
Pistachio, malt, wood and orange finish, which remains to fill the palate for a long time.
Well balanced and harmonious flavors and aromas, where the bursting sweetness of the sherry is tamed by less accommodating tones without screeching and without clamor, succeeding where many have failed."
4.0,"Finally opened another one. This expression of Mortlach is sweet and in the nose there’s sherry, species and something that I cannot make out, but it pulls me to it.  The palate, more sherry and citric, a nice warmth on the finish.  Overall, I liked this expression very much.  Very traditional."

3.75,"Served neat in a Glencairn from a freshly opened full bottle.

Nose has quite a bit of alcohol, but also has the Sherry influence, with ginger beer and apple turnover notes, and sulphur lurking in the shadows.

Entry is smoother than the nose would suggest, with a medium mouth-feel.  Vanilla dominates, although not dialed to Bourbon levels, thankfully.

Pallate is leathery and nutty with some restrained butterscotch, and slightly underripe Asian pears. The faint bitterness is somewhere between sulphur, lemon and brine.

Finish is long, but the alcohol makes its presence known.  Cocoa, 

This is a bit boring, and not as complex as I would expect for the age and price.  I loved the discontinued 18, bit this is a huge letdown.  Will not buy another bottle of this, ever.  I would accept a free dram, however, as it's not offensive.  Therein lies the problem: this is no beast, this is a pussycat, and there are other drams that play this game better, for less money."

3.0,"Sweet scotch on the nose. I like it. Biggest on the entry, then tapers towards the back. Light finish, but the sherry comes through in a good way. Extremely mellow finish. A very drinkable scotch."
