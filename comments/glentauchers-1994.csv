4.5,"The nose is very aromatic with sweet citrus, mandarin, pineapple and hints of malt all in a beautiful, simple arrangement. The palate starts off spicy with cardamom, along with malted milk on top of light and sweet flavors of citrus and pineapple. The finish is long and mouth warming with lingering spice, malt and pineapple that lasts and lasts before gently fading."
