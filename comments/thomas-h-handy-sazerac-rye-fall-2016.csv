5.0,"Super duper insanely delicious. The high proof of 126.2 isn't overwhelming, and this Fall 2016 release is leaps and bounds better than this year's George T. Stagg. The Handy has this delicious honey graham cracker thing going on, as well as a good amount of fruit. I paid through the nose for it ($400), but don't regret it in the least bit. If you can get a bottle I highly highly recommend it."

5.0,Heavenly. It's creamier than the 2015. Everything about this is better than 2015 and the 2015 is fantastic.

4.0,"Deep nose, a hint of bread and butter pickles. Strong alcohol notes, the proof is evident. Complex on the tongue. Floats a bit, like it never fully releases all its flavor. Don't get me wrong, this is delicious. 12/22/17
Sweet pickles on the nose andpalate, mixed with sweet fruit. Spicy. Pecan shells at the end. Rich and deep, and waaaaaaarm. 7/7/18"

4.5,"128.8 proof
No burn
Licorice is the first note I taste- vanilla at the back of the throat.
Neat"
4.5,"NOSE: Pumpkin bread dipped in molasses. Ground white pepper. Subtle burnt toast in there.

PALATE: Pumpkin spice latte with maple syrup drizzle, super deep mint chocolate on the finish.

OVERALL: Beautiful fusion of flavors, that go way beyond normal Bourbon/Rye notes in invoking taste profiles from desserts and foods."
