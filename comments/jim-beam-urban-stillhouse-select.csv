3.0,"Nose is a lot of ethanol a little oak and the faintest of vanillas if I really search for it. Palate is a lot more palatable than the nose lets on flood of oak and a touch of vanilla. Finish is where this pour shines medium length brown sugar honey and vanilla still hanging out in the background. Great drink classic bourbon profile.

My score- 3

2.5,"Just OK. Worth the experience for a small bottle, but there are a lot better alternatives for less.

Nose: Sweet with oak and hints of butterscotch. Slight fusel alcohol smell on the end. 

Pallette: Light honey, butterscotch, and an almost citrus fruit touch to start. Quickly fades into a big simple cinnamon burn. 

Finish: Not very smooth compared to the aroma and the finish is a little short and dry. Left my mouth with that alcohol burn, but not really any other lingering flavors."

3.75,For a 100 proof bourbon it has the smoothness of a low 90. A nice sipping bourbon
2.25,One of the worst bourbons I've ever had. The novelty of bottling it at the Stillhouse and sticking a little medallion on it doesn't make up for the fact it's just awful. regular Jim Beam is better in every way.

3.0,"The nose is very spicy at first, but as it breathes notes of brown sugar, oak, butterscotch, hazelnut and maple come out in nice balance. The palate is soft and sweet, with cinnamon coating the mouth balanced by vanilla, and faint notes of caramel. The finish is short to medium with cinnamon and a bit of pepper leaving the mouth tingling while flavors from the palate fade a little too quick."
