3.0,"Smoky aroma, almost like a cooling fireplace, filed by notes of caramel. Very smooth, easy, almost too ready. Pretty smoky finish. Quite good for the price."

3.0,My pick of the affordable Chivas offerings.  Subtle sherry gives it something extra (hence the name I guess).  Good value for money.
3.0,"Easy to drink, but that's partly because there isn't a very strong flavour. Fairly smooth with a slight smokey quality."

5.0,"Excellent value, well matured flavour, with the Sherry cask coming through. Rich lingering smothness on the back of the tongue."
3.0,"Not to shabby, especially in this price range. Its something to shake up the Chivas 12 and Johnny Black rut without splurging."
3.0,"As compared to the 12 year, this lacks the smoke and apples, replacing with sweet red berries.  Not that flavorful though, smooth, and a honey finish"

2.0,"I purchased this bottle to do a triple comparison to 2 other bottles from the Chivas Regal line of blended scotch.  This is a NAS blend that was finished for an unspecified amount of time in ex-sherry casks.  It's a nice, dark copper and comes in at the usual 80 proof.

If you read my reviews of the Chivas 12 & 18 year scotches, I can sum this one up easily:  Take the sherry sweetness of the 18 year old and add in the harshness from the younger 12 year old and you have Chivas Extra.  It's a cheap way to drink sherry cask finished scotch, but I can't say I recommend it.  I'd actually rather have the regular 12 year old simply because there's a bit more of an ""experience"" when drinking it.  

This bottle comes in at $40, and that should tell you exactly what you're getting- a cheap, blended and mediocre scotch.  Its gonna take me awhile to finish this bottle because almost every other bottle in my collection is better than this so I can't see myself reaching for it.  Maybe I'll do some experimental blending of my own with some other 2-3 star single malts and see what I can do.

Cheers, my friends."

5.0,I absolutely loved the taste and aroma of this blend. Strong taste of wood and sherry but not overwhelming
3.25,"Tastes young, overly sweet, and has a clingy mouthfeel. Glad I only got a sampler of this, but it could be much worse."
3.5,"Appearance: The color I found in this blended scotch was a russet muscat according to the whiskey color chart (deep amber). Thin and semi-viscous legs made their way down the inside of my glass.

Nose: The nose was overall fruity and floral with a sweet syrupy inflection. Notes of plums and cherries, soft ripe pear, banana, and light peat smoke and brine danced their way into my nose. Adding a splash of water made it too soft in my opinion and didn’t add anything worthwhile to the experience.

Taste: The body of the whisky was oily and delicious. The palate contained notes of pears, red fruits, almonds, honey, aromatic pipe tobacco, and buttered toast. Adding a splash of water, much like the nose, made the scotch too light and just watered it down.

Finish: The finish was medium in length, and it left behind a sweet honeyed flavor to remember it by.

Thoughts: I really enjoyed this scotch! I like the entry level Chivas, but if you can spare the extra bucks to get this next step up, go for it! It’s bolder and has more complexity and flavor. I would recommend this scotch to anyone, and wouldn’t mind getting it again. Chivas Regal, many thanks! Sláinte!"

3.25,"A more robust Chivas, which is nice. Lots of sweet sherry, but there's some bite to the tail. Slightly above average for a sherried scotch"
3.5,"Olfato: adocicado, panetone, frutos vermelhos, frutos cristalizados, canela, um pouco cítrico, apimentado, caramelo, álcool.

Paladar: apimentado, adocicado, frutos secos, frutos cristalizados, especiarias, gengibre é um pouco de calor de álcool. Um leve amargor também é perceptível.

Finalização: curta, suave, leve e com um pouco de apimentado de gengibre vindo à tona. 

Impressões gerais: bom custo benefício. Quem quer degustar um whisky suave e que serve tanto para coquetéis, para beber com gelo ou mesmo puro talvez esse seja o whisky. Recomendo deixar uns minutos na taça antes de começar a degustação, pois os vapores de álcool são atenuados e os aromas se desenvolvem de forma mais interessante."
3.0,"Not too much stands out about this. The color is light and simple. Legs run very thin but hold on a while before sliding down the glass.

Nose - inviting at first but seems to have a little burn at the end. Lacks any defining character. 

Taste - enters with a slight sweet spice, but finishes rather bland with an oaky taste that ends rather abruptly. Bit of a burn at the end."
3.25,very good for the price

3.5,"The nose has honey, beeswax, flowers, and dried fruit. The palate has the sweet dried fruits I expected from the nose, but is balanced nicely with a little bit a smoke. A few spices join in during as the main flavors start to fade for a medium length finish.

Nothing too complex here, but nothing unpleasant either. This whisky has a nice balance to it. I'm not sure it's worth the premium over Chivas 12, but I certainly wouldn't turn down a glass."

3.75,"Definate Sherry influence, it is like the 12 year, a little thinner, but with more dry fruit. 
The nose is light, a little sharp, with hints of vanilla and citrus. 
The palette is vanilla, citrus, plums, and a faint wisp of smoke.  
The finish is dry, a sour note, some mild barrel tannins, and a lingering citrus, more pithy than bright."

3.5,"Warm honey, stewed fruit, and wisps of campfire smoke greet the front palate."
3.5,"The color is  mid dark,  the nose,hints of orange, peat and caramel....the taste is clean, little peaty, peppery on the tongue....and oaky....nice finish...let it breathe a bit....it gets better....for the $ this is a good value buy...IMO

cheers..."

3.25,"Definitely a cut above the normal Chivas 12, the added sherry casking definitely adds substance. Used to be $42 a fifth in OR, it’s now $29...but I think it’s clearance. Definitely a good buy as it’s cheaper than the 12."

3.25,"At first glance it was too hot for 40%, I even double checked ABV on bottle. Good oak palette."
4.25,"Very smooth and easy to drink. Nose is deliciously sweet of vanilla and caramel. Tongue, nice and easy of fruit, side of mouth have the spice of ginger but not a lot."
3.25,"Nose: pretty good, sweet fruits, honey, chocolate

Palate and finish: quite disappointing after a good start, simple and short"
2.25,"This is a while lot better then regular Chivas Regal 12, though it still isn't very good. The flavor is richer and more fun, but no tremendous amount of depth develops here."

4.0,"My war horse. A good, cheap, sherried whisky. Figs, raisins, maraschino cherries, wedding cake, christmas cake, candied fruits. 

On the palate it is a little rough, but greatly sherried. Dark chocolate and tobacco. Red fruits.

Aftertaste has a cinmamon, dark chocolate bitter chocolate. Great dram, 85 over 100"
