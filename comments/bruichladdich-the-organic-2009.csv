4.0,"This was one of the standout surprises of the eight or nine whiskies I tried last night at a Bruichladdich event. There’s a floral, Pinot Gris note to the nose. The flavors mingle lemongrass and hay before turning creamy. The finish is long and peppery. A lovely summer’s dram, with a color to match a sunny day."

5.0,This is just true beauty when it comes to scotch. In my top 5 easily.
4.0,"Nice stuff, I was a little apprehensive at first that they would focus too much on being organic and not be able to fill a good bottle. But they really did well with this, another one of their unpeated scotches that tastes like it is peated. But not overly, a balanced rich dram you could drink everyday. Regular price around $100 CAD."
