3.75,"Used exclusively for hot toddys, this stuff is great! Not a huge fan of flavored whiskey in general but Todd really knows how to bring out the natural apple flavor! Nothing artificial here."
0.5,"Honestly, I was psyched to try it but after a couple tastes I dumped the bottle. Don’t understand how Leopold’s can make *fantastic* if hit or miss cordials (Maraschino, I’m looking at you... 5 stars instantly) and the whiskeys (flavored or American/Maryland Rye) be so polarizing. I only say that because of the ratings. I haven’t personally met a fan, but I also like bold risk takers. So cheers for the effort."
