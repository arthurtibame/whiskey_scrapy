4.5,"Seriously good. The fruity orchard flavors of their flagship single malt are richly amplified by the higher strength and beautifully seasoned by a light peat from the whisky that occupied the quarter casks previously. Despite the strength and the youthfulness, this goes down neat as smooth as honey. An outstanding achievement."
5.0,"Drammers club pour. Very good, takes that fruity Cotswolds with a little peat added in not overpowering.
