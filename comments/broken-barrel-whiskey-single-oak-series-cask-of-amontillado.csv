3.0,"Aroma is good with a soft sweet complexity that pulls in some fruity roasty notes; Palate is a blend of young notes and old notes with pops of spirit here and there mixing with spicy and herbal notes; Finish is nice, but picks up a bit of that woody craft profile."

4.0,"Neat this has quite a large bite on the front being 55%.  The oak is prominent with an soft leather tone.  I would like to say that the finish is very smooth, but that may simply be due to the intensity of the first few sips. Over an ice ball or large cube this is quite enjoyable. That said, I am rather new to modern whiskeys (took a 10 year break from it) and this was one of my first bottles back. It was approachable for someone with little experience."
