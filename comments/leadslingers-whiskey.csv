2.0,"Young (8 months), bites the bullet with ethanol and damp mossy nose, lacks character, but some water brings out a very brief unrefined corn syrup sweetness that promptly disappears into unflattering heat. Seems like more age would bring out its potential. I support our veterans and bought 2 bottles, but won’t buy anymore. ‘Merica."

5.0,Great tasting young bourbon!
1.0,"About the worst Bourbon I've ever drank. Don't waste your time with this one,pass,pass !"
5.0,Fantastic young bourbon.  Light on tip of tongue and rolls back easily.  It's great to see a veterans organization standing up for us and hiring.

1.0,"It burns your throat, singes your nose hairs, and erases your taste buds. It's only good if it was designed to be mixed with soft drinks. As a bourbon it's just terrible."

5.0,"I didn't care for it neat, but an ice cube brings out its flavor and a little sweetness. Good whiskey for the price, run by veterans."
3.0,"As others have noted, it definitely tastes young. Probably best in mixed drinks. Good for what it is and the price. It seems like they are going for a ""Party Whiskey"" and it works for that. Always like to support veterans too."
