null,I love bookers and have been in search of 25. One question can this technically be called bourbon when the rules of bourbon say it must be bottled at 125 proof or less?
4.0,test
5.0,Doesn't taste like it is over 130 proof and the aroma from this is overwhelming in a good way.  The taste is polished with a wave of sweetness on the finish.

4.0,It was like someone was having a party on my freaking tongue. The first sip was unbelievably smooth for the proof. I wish I could get ahold of a bottle. I stumbled across a bottle in a bar and decided to treat myself. Superior bourbon.

4.0,"Nose is a charred campfire, color and body are thick amber. First taste is syrupy caramel molasses candy with a long fiery peppery burning finish that goes back to the campfire."
5.0,"It's like when I grill in the backyard, lots of char, clouds of smoke, but somehow it comes out great, every time! If you find this bourbon DON'T pass it by."

null,Marketed as Booker's Bourbon 130.8 Pr. Batch C07-B-7 750ML but similar profile to the 25th Anniversary. Purchased from Michael town winds in February 2015 for $60. Here is the link to the Chuck Cowdery article http://chuckcowdery.blogspot.com/2014/05/in-which-i-help-pick-your-next-bottle.html

4.75,"N - Had to go deep to get a good nose, dark chocolate and caramel, rich candied with spice linger
P - Sweet and floral up front with an incredible chocolate finish. Very unique. 
F - Chocolate! Incredibly smooth, juicy finish

Floral, sweet and chocolatey vibes. Like I say in other rare Booker’s reviews - never pass it up given the opportunity."

5.0,"Wow.... phenomenal dram. Not sure if this or GTS is my all-time fave... you know that amazing smell of the Booker’s boxes their bottles are sold with? That’s the nose of the 25th with an assault of vanilla, cherry soda, and a tinge of marshmallow... palate follows suit- spicy, oak, cherry soda, marshmallow. Think Booker’s without the prominent corn profile while incorporating the best characteristics of GTS & WLW. Finish is smooth and linger lasts of oaky vanilla. Bravo."

5.0,"Fantastic bourbon. Nose is rich with hints of dried fruit, almost a little sweet. Taste is classic Booker's but better... Smoother with more complexity, nuanced dried fruit and molasses. I'm pretty sure this is what God intended bourbon to taste like."
