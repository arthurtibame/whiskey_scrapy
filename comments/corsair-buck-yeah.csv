3.0,"While not exactly my style, this is a very unique whisky that I wholeheartedly different than anything I've tried before.

It tastes like Milwaukee smells:  an off yet desirable brewer's yeasty funk.  It's almost reminiscent of a stale beer.  The maltiness shines through the palate but the finish is sweet and surprisingly refined for a young whisky.  There is a distinct pistachio nuttiness here that is off-putting at first, but grows on me quickly.  I keep coming back to this very interesting spirit to keep my palate sharp and find a break in the monotonous offerings by so many other distillers."

3.0,"Smells like honey and berries, some malt notes. Palate doesn't seem to follow the nose. Earth notes initially, then some strong wood flavor, followed by roasted brown rice and tea. Vanilla as well. Sweet in stages. Hotter than I expected for the proof. 6/23/17"

4.0,"I've had one Corsiar before---their Triple Smoke, which I didn't like at all.  But, like High West, I really admire their maverick approach and trying to carve a different route than your run of the mill whiskey.  This is a beer drinker's whiskey, similar to St George single malt, which I loved.   You get a distinctive hoppy taste, like a mild stout.  With a bit of ice or water, it takes away what would be a harsh finish due to its youth.  Really worthwhile to,try--something different and unique.  Thanks to Scott for the generous sample!  A fitting drink sitting here on a Sunday evening watching Manning and company squeak one by the Boys."
4.0,"After a semi-quick stint to Maryland, was anxious to open this bottle after seeing on the shelf in a local liquor store. This is my first Corsair purchase. They have intrigued me in that they seem to be experimenting and they don't seem too concerned about trying different and unique combinations, somewhat similar to High West. The nose is somewhat unique with some bourbon traits however softer with (de)shelled pistachios, cocoa, clove and a touch of oak.  Excellent nose. A vanilla sweetness initially arrives and gives way to a hint of raspberry with oak and nutmeg. The palate is left slightly woody of cedar or pine with spearmint and nutmeg.  A teaspoon of water rounds the edges and tones the feel of the dram and is preferable without as it looses a bit of character. This is perfectly suited for a late October or November/Thanksgiving fall harvest time season. Very enjoyable and slightly different.  I believe this is a limited edition, so if you find one I don't think the purchase will be a disappointment. [Dried glass: cedar and vanilla][$53][88/100][Opened: 8/29/16]"
