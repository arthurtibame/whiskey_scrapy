4.5,"Almost everything that Ardbeg makes is fantastic. This one was no exception to that rule. Ardbeg Perpetuum was released for Ardbeg Day on 2015 to conmemorate Ardbeg's 200th anniversary. It has a beautiful ""infinite symbol"" on the label. 

Bottled at 47.4%abv 

On the nose, Lemon. Peat is overwhelming, maybe not in a appealing way. Vanilla, Bacon, Lime and Heathery peat.

On the palate, it is amazing. Vanilla. Lemon infusion tea. Pepper and Moss. Such and interesting and delicious dram. Perfect score here.

Aftertaste is also very interesting, since it has a tobacco cigar note, not a tobacco leaf, but a tobacco cigar. Peat smoke is also present in a great way.

Overall this is a very nice dram. A nice tribute to this distillery and its anniversary. 93 out of 100. Sláinte!"

2.0,A little less peaty than other Ardbegs with notes of dark bitter chocolate orange. Nice enough but somewhat atypical for a celebration of Ardbeg.

4.0,"Nosent is pretty strong at first.  There's peat there, but it's not overwhelming. A bit of orange zest, a hint of salt/brine.  The taste is fairly light but complex. Starts off sweet and ends salty.  You can taste some young and wild whisky as well as some more mature and smooth stuff in it.  Less sweet and peaty than the ten year, but not as salty as the corryvreckan.  Very enjoyable, but not my favorite ardbeg."

4.0,"For the price ($90), it's not bad.  Certainly brings a muted old Ardbeg taste and aroma, but a creamier, more floral touch as well.  If given one choice to buy, I'd still go for the Corry, followed by 10, and then Aurivedes."

And my top favorite distillery is Ardbeg. This 200th edition is a must in my bar now. If you can still get one bottle u better get it because it will soon be gone."

4.0,"Pretty smokey, a bit peaty, and a bit of citrus on the nose, which is actually quite strong. the smoke follows through on the palate, with a sweetness that turns salty/briney towards the finish. Pretty spicy up front, mellowing out towards the end. Very nice altogether. A great dram, but probably not my favorite Ardbeg expression."

5.0,Beautiful nose that's expected with Ardbeg very crisp and clean floral notes. I'm the front of the mouth I tasted citrus and lemon grass notes. In the back of the moth I taste a milky ash smoky flavor that seems to standup and do a jig.. I enjoyed my bottle to the fullest! Ardbeg day 2015 limited release!

2.0,"Sampled at Dan's Bicton tasting with Bud and Dog. Nice (haven't had a bad Ardbeg) but prefer the more in your face and deeper Ten and the far more identifiably complex Uigeadail. This one seems overly balanced out if that makes any sense, and a bit one flavoured the way through. I don't get the same journey in terms of complexity as the other Ardbegs I've had"

4.0,"This limited release from 2015 is supposedly a mix of ""very old"" and ""very young"" whiskies.  I traded for a sample of the distillery release, which as the name suggests was available only at Ardbeg and in more limited quantities than the other version of Perpetuum (which also was a few points less alcoholic).  So this review is for a slightly different version (this Distiller page is for the 47% percent version, the one I tried was 49.2%).  After this sample, I like it but don't love it -- it feels like a slightly smokier and much more expensive Ardbeg 10.  The nose is dominated by smoke and wood, so it almost smells like the inside of a longstick matchbox and spent embers from a fire.  The only other note I detect is pepper.  The palate is also peppery and smoky, although it has more sweetness, hay, and citrus than the nose.  The finish is peppery and smoky, with a mouthful of oats at the end."

4.0,"This one reminds me a lot of the Lagavulin 8. It's young, but has those great breakfast dram qualities.  There's one problem, and a big problem with Perpetuum.  It's more than double the price, and it's not worth it.  If they reintroduced it at 60-65 American dollars (which will never happen) I might buy another bottle.  

I bought another bottle. Lol. I had to update my review from 3 stars to 4 stars.  After several months, I’ve tried a lot of distilleries that try to get into the “peat” game, but most just don’t cut the mustard.  Ardbeg ALWAYS follows through with a very nice balance, and the Perpetuum is no different. The smoke, citrus, chocolate, briny salt sea spray, and the meaty savory notes are just to die for. 4.0 indeed!"

3.0,"Let me start by saying I love Ardbeg. I think this is a solid offering and hope to continue to see it in stores. Classic ardbeg smoke with brine on the nose. Perpetuum has this creamy undertone that makes it different from a lot of ardbegs, softens it a bit. The palate definitely has some sweatness and it compliments the smoke so well. All of the classic ardbeg on the palate you would want, with a gentle lingering creaminess that leaves you craving more."

I told them after this I'm done and to stop serving me....anyhow where was I Ardbeg Perpetuum I think I'm reviewing..sandwiched between the other two and after Kilchoman 09 I thought it'd be toast but no it held its own. I really enjoyed this...my tongue is a bit numb so I'm going to say smoke vanilla and leave it at that...ah damn lemon on the aftertaste. I'll ignore that 3.75...wouldn't buy a bottle but enjoyed the sample. I now have to think how to hide the large bill that will come through on the credit card...."

En bouche, la tourbe est présente mais équilibrée par un côté salin et une belle rondeur. C’est charnu, présent, chaleureux.
La finale est très persistante et super agréable, peu fumée mais bien tourbée, chaleureuse sur la langue et dans la gorge"

3.0,"I was sent a sample of this 200th Anniversary specialty malt from Ardbeg several months ago as a part of a trade with a new friend from Maryland, @Telex.  This bottle was created and released in honor of Ardbeg Day, during the annual Feis Isle Festival, in 2015.  This was bottled at 47.4% ABV and is light gold in color.  Spinning it in a Glencairn reveals an oily glass-coat with slow forming, thin legs.  It also releases that typical Ardbeg BBQ’d meaty smoke into the vicinity.

The nose is everything you know and love about Ardbeg:  smoked brisket, seaweed, briny seaside air and fresh cut oak.  There’s a surprising hit of alcohol floating throughout the glass.  That’s not something I expected.

The palate follows along closely to the nose with meaty and earthy peat, lighter than usual smoke and salt.  There’s a strange balancing act with the mouth feel going on, too- one minute it feels oily, then it turns dry.  It’s odd and doesn’t really play well with the flavors present.  You can tell that a majority of the whisky is on the younger side, as well.

The finish is medium length, smoky and salty with a stronger bite of pepper and oak at the tail end.  This dram feels like it wants to separate flavors and elements throughout the entire sip, and not in a good way.  The flavors are solid and established, they just aren’t playing nice with one another.  Everything feels rushed.

Overall, I’m glad I got to sample this one, but it’s not on my list of highly regarded Ardbeg’s due to the complete uneven feel.  Thanks again, Jason.  Sadly, this one falls in the mediocre category and I want to give it a 3-3.25 star rating.  It’s not Ardbeg’s finest effort to date.  Cheers."

4.5,"какой-то прям сладкий ардбег, неожиданно"
3.75,"Nose: Fresh briny gusts blowing in from the sound. Salt spray, iodine, sea-wrack and a muted but invigorating peat-reek. The distant smoke from an ancient steamer beating its way against the tide. There's citrus and vanilla notes and a hay-like dustiness to the smoke. They say there were sherry casks in this mix but it noses like a very pure bourbon maturation. Those sherry casks were new American oak, for sure. Adding water does not improve the nose - it evolves plastic aromas and loses delicacy. Much better neat. [The dry-glass aroma is strong vanilla. Yep, American oak].

Palate: Brisk and fresh arrival practically crackling with fresh barley. Maritime and salty and in the initial development there is a sudden rush of grapefruit and lemon pepper. The smoke pervades the palate but is outpaced by the citrus notes and it lacks texture a little, being thin, brittle, ashen and light. An almost brackish note like olive brine emerges later. Adding water sweetens but cheapens the profile, and over time it becomes very sweet.

Finish: Long. Maritime and sooty with a prolonged sour/sweet aftertaste veering pleasantly towards salted milk chocolate in the finale.

The nose is comparatively gentle for an Ardbeg and has a crisp lightness of touch however the palate is a little lacking, but admittedly delicate and elegant. I like the official tasting note that there is no middle to the whisky, just a beginning and end. Truth. There is no evidence of alcohol at any stage - the nose and palate are completely devoid of intrusive ethanol, even at almost 48%. It's probably the most discreet and genteel Ardbeg I've tasted.

More than anything, this makes me imagine what peated sea-water would taste like, if you could make such a thing. It is simple, direct, and most likely very young with little cask influence showing. Water doesn't exactly hurt it but it does make the profile more ""ordinary"". Neither does it open much over time in the glass. Pour this and quaff it neat.

I enjoyed this whisky, but it's one of those drams that you score well but think ""Would I buy a bottle of this? Probably not."" Still, it's a good dram and for me only just a fraction short of 4 stars.

Tasted from a 30ml sampler.

""Good"" : 3.75 stars"
4.0,"I love the Laphroaig Cairdeas series. I love Ardbeg 10, Corry, and Ugi. So it only makes sense that I'd venture into the Ardbeg annual-release series, which is their Cairdeas equivalent. I jumped at this one because it's a 2015 release; naturally it's become quite exclusive and thus worth an immediate buy. Let's check it out.

Nose: Heavy brine and campfire smoke and ash. Iodine and sea salt. Brine and peat smoke dominate this one. There's a sweet custard note. Beyond that are heavy lemon and grapefruit citrus notes. Vanilla, honey, and butterscotch, and black pepper. A nice combination of peat, brine, citrus, sweetness, and just a little spice. Liking it so far.

Palate: Nice campfire smoke, iodine, band-aid, briny sea salt, seaweed, and ash. Citrus bomb: Lemon and grapefruit, again, now with lime. Meaty ham/pork note. Vanilla, butterscotch, honey, and toffee. Some milk chocolate. Not a hint of spice or ABV.

Finish: More of the smoke and salt. A spice kick of oak, cinnamon, and black pepper hits hard once the smoke passes. As the spice fades, I pick up milk chocolate and hazelnut. Then, as the moderate-long finish fades, I'm hit with one last puff of tobacco smoke. Interesting finish.

4.0 stars. Well above average, not quite enough to be considered a standout. For the $85 I paid, it's worthwhile change of pace from the standard Ardbeg releases.If you're thinking about paying secondary prices to get this one, well, stop thinking about it.

The nose is great, the rest is very good. I cut this one some slack since it's not egregiously overpriced like many of the other one-off releases. There's a lot to like here, and I think this is a great embodiment of both Ardbeg and Islay character. At any rate, I'm glad I was able to nab one of these so late in the game."
