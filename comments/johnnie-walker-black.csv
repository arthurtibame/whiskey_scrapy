4.0,"Surprisingly enjoyable for such a commercial brand. Lightly smoked, accenting some terrific vanilla tobacco, cinnamon and citrus spices. The burn is pleasant and blunted.

The long you let it sit under the tongue, the more mellow it gets. This would go great with a pipe. The TOBACCO is the dominant flavor to me. This is a really terrific option if the price is right."

3.5,"Peat, oak, and vanilla on the nose, in that order. Mild peat, strong oak, citrus, then more peat at the end as it finishes slow and the smoke flavor really releases in the back of the palate at the very end. I thought I didn’t like peat at all, but this might be just the perfect entry level peaty scotch. I may have to get another nip later and see if I feel the same way. Pleasantly surprised."

3.0,"Nose - mild peat smoke, musty brine, sweet cream, caramel, orange, plum, raisins, oak notes, light ethanol burn. 

Taste - peat smoke, brine, lightly burnt oak, toffee, vanilla, allspice, coffee/chocolate, mild alcohol burn, finishing very quickly with short lived oaky toffee flavor. 

I can taste the Lagavulin coming through most prominently. However, I only like this one slightly more than the red label, as it doesn’t have the strong burnt oak bitterness. It generally tastes too diluted and largely forgettable."

3.75,"Starting my journey with this one. Had whiskey before, never have I consciously analyzed its taste though. 

I like its smell more than the actual taste when the beverage is in my mouth. I can scent citrusy notes. 
The aftertaste is another highlight for me, it reminds me of I unripe (green or black skinned) walnuts that I loved to rip off of trees in my backyard in order to smell them. I also get some citrusy notes in the aftertaste.
The very first note when flushing my mouth with whiskey is a very pleasant and subtle sour sensation on my tongue. Sensing an uncommon sweetness short before the aftertaste is presented, I still feel like I am missing a lot of notes during the period of the beverage flushing my mouth- presumably as a beginner I am overwhelmed by the complexity and intensity it’s taste."

3.0,"Alright! Got me a sample of JW Black!

Nose is nice. Some sour fruits and a bit of peat. The peat shows itself more with each taste. About the same on the taste but the peat is a bit more prominent on the backend. There’s a bit of honeyed sweetness there. This has some heat on the finish with a lingering medicinal taste. 

It was ok. I hear great things about JW Green, so I gotta try that next"

3.75,"Much more peated than the red or green. And I LOVE the peat flavor in this. It's very balanced. The smoke isn't as aggressive as Laphroaig 10yr, which works really well in this. However, the grain whisky is too strong and really hurts the flavor profile. Because as you drink you immediately hit that wonderful smoke BUT then it's goes to that hard grain whisky flavor which it ruins the finish (at least for me). I haven't tried the double black but I am interested to see how it compares."

3.5,"Nose with a slight alcoholic hint (which with 40%ABV is never a good start), it is still quite fresh and clean, with herbaceous and mineral tones together with yellow fruit (peach, apricot and melon), orange, light vanilla and lemon peel. The peat is really a hint in the background, more vegetable than smoky. All in all pleasant, but so far it has very little of a ""black"" soul.
The peat comes out in the palate, even if on the background, with an ashy and toasty contribution, while the citrus fruits and the fruity notes of the nose remain frontal with the addition of almonds and butter biscuit. Always herbaceous and fresh, with a light and subtle profile, with alcohol well present (too much) and a certain bitter and metallic note that develops over time.
The finish is rather short, of citrus fruits, ash, metal.
Drinkable but not too much, in small quantities it is pleasant but in the long run it expresses an unpleasant artificial note that breaks the lightness of the whole.
All in all, it keeps what it promises, mixed it gives a touch of ash enough not to stir the spirits, and can be a good starting point for those who want to get closer to Scotch whisky."
3.25,"Pepper or clove, earthy with hints of honey and fruits on the nose. Spicy and very earthy on the palate. Not bad."
3.25,"Perhaps still one of the biggest mysteries is why this blended scotch with strong notes of Islay additions is priced lower than $50 a bottle.  While it might push away those who dislike peat and smoke, it is a wonderful addition (some might say basic necessity) for any home bar."

3.5,"A gentle and surprisingly complex blended scotch!  Inviting with the nose of cinnamon raisin bread, subtlety introduces you to smoke and vanilla, sort of like a burnt crème brûlée, in good way, as hits your mouth. 
Like a baby- laphroaig it try’s to hang in there with the peat. Simple finish as the smoke lingers subtlety and pleasantly. For the price, this is a great scotch to introduce someone to who wants to try something “Smokey”!"
