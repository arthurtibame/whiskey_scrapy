3.25,"This has a strong charred barrel flavor profile consisting of burnt caramel, baking spice and a finish that tastes like coffee to me.  It smells wonderfully sweet like a bakery.  The proof on this bottle gives a strong Kentucky hug."
3.0,"A bit of a polarizing whisky and frankly, extremely expensive 3 year old bourbon.  

Nose - funky oak, bright caramel, just sticky sweet, and then more light oak.  A really unique nose, the french oak is really adding something special here.  I however expect many will find the funk off putting and yes there's fresh young alcohol spirit.  I also get green apples, some corn, and well grain alcohol.  There's a touch of metallic notes as well.  

Taste - slightly medicinal, funky oak, alcohol, sour notes, and lots of every changing oak character.  I really like the flavors here but I could see someone just as easily thinking it's under aged and awful.  I think the big issue or confusion is that this doesn't taste like bourbon to me.  One note - just add a few drops of water to this from the start.  It's just a far better experience.  

Finish - linger sweetness and more traditional oak notes.  

It's nearly 90 bucks a bottle (a cool as heck bottle) so I'm just scoring it 3.0, but frankly this is a polarizing bottle.  If you have any questions in your head or aren't adventurous, pass."
4.0,"Neat.  This is different.  Funky.  But in a good way.  Not a typical bourbon.  Almost a mix between a bourbon and Irish Whiskey to me.  Nose is very approachable, no sign of the youngness or high abv.  I get a lot of short bread cookie dipped in some dark caramel.  The short bread notes are what take me to a Cask Strength Red Breast, but with these dark undertones.

Nice thick mouth feel.  Lots of sweet notes and even some oak notes at first.  Gives way to that short bread cookie and caramel.  Caramel and oak on the finish.

I like it but I can understand why some are thrown off by it too.  No regrets on the purchase.  It’s expensive for what it is, but it’s kinda fun for its funkiness and uniqueness."
