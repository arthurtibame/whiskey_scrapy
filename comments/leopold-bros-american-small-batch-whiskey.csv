3.0,"Very subtle flavoring, possibly too subtle. Chocolate after-taste is pleasant, very light butterscotch on the tongue. I can't stress enough how light these flavors are. Could be disappointing to some, but it's easy enough to drink."

2.75,"This is hard. I want to like this one but I can’t. Nose is caramel and leather. In the mouth smooth, but the taste is rotting leather. The pear goes right to bitter until it has had a lot of time to open up. The finish is short and mildly unpleasant."
