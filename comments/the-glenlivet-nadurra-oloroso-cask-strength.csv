4.0,"Nose: Dried Figs and Oranges, Raisins, Red grape, red apple with a bit of cinnamon a hint of citrus such as lemon zest, and a strawberry Jam. 

Taste: Rich Orange Marmalade, Grape Jam, a bit sharp in the middle (however not bad for the high proof), toffee, thin caramel, feels although there is so much cinnamon it is burning my mouth, thin and sharp finish just dropping off."

 whiskeys one opened to the air for awhile!"

3.5,Ok tasting and strong
3.75,"Good but has the alcohol burn of a very young whisky. Somebody once told me ""You don't always get what you pay for but you always  get what you don't pay for!"""

4.5,"Sherry forward with a hint of pepper and atomic bite!  Very nice expression of the toffee, coffee traditional Glenlivet Scotch with an added bonus of manicured and refined sherry polish. 

If you like a sherry finished whiskey this is for you. The sherry complexity is among the best I’ve tried. This is a dram good pour!"

4.25,"A cask strength expression from Glenlivet, Nadurra means ""Nature"". I have had the 48%abv before and it was great. This one is totally different but just as good. 

Bottled at 60.7%; pale straw color.

On the nose, chocolate fudge, earthy, Super appealing, freshly baked Brownies.
Forest.

On the palate, buttery, chocolate and cereal. A little straightforward, but it works. Aftertaste is a strong atomic pepper bomb.

Since it is a cask strength, i added a couple of drops of water, it released banana flavors and aroma, just as the 48%abv one."

4.25,"From  Batch OL1117, bottled at 60.3% ABV bottled on 11/17.  Tasted neat from a Glencairn and allowed to sit for about 10 minutes after the pour.  

This whisky pours a crystaline amber with notable sheeting and slow legs .  It looks almost like a dark honey.  Nothing about the appearance of this would indicate it is such a high proof product.

On the nose there is immediate honey, molasses, fruitcake with maybe a hint of nutmeg.  The aromas rising from the glass are wonderful.  They are rich, sweet and subtle.  This is a whisky that rewards patience and continued exploration.

On the palate there is absolutely no indication of the proof.  This is as clean, smooth and rich as any whisky I've had.  The finish is where the proof shows itself, with a glow of heat building after the swallow and coming on in waves over a slow fade to a sweet, syrupy mouthfeel.  The finish is really quite amazing - slow, long and luxurious.

The taste is primarily sweet with impressions of fruit. The sherry is notable and well integrated.  There isn't as much complexity on the tongue as the nose promised, with a slight hint of oak, some vague and ghostly smokiness, creamy honey and butterscotch all pointing to a rich sherry heritage.

I like this scotch, but oddly I'm not satisfied with it.  I'd love to see just a bit more complexity in the flavor profile, maybe a little separation of the notes in this whisky symphony.  The influence of the sherry might be just a tad too much.  Perfect for dessert or as an alternative to a rich XO cognac.  

My ratings are from 1 (I'll be drinking something else, please), 2 (acceptable as a mixer or based on price/performance ratio),  3 (an good average whisky, glad to have in on my bar), 4 (exceptional whisky and the lower boundary goal for my my curated collection) and, 5 (truly extraordinary in every way)."
4.25,"Following my last Nadurra review, it’s time for another. This time we come to the Oloroso matured cask strength release. This is from batch OL1015, and is bottled at 60.3% ABV and is non chill filtered and natural color of a dark amber. 

The nose starts with strong alcohol (understandable given the high ABV) but also very sweet with a rich sherry fruitiness. Intense raisins and figs with a strong oaky backbone. Lots of vanilla and chocolate and a wonderful sherry envelopment. Fruitcake, dried fruits like cherries, apricots and plums with a lovely dusting of cinnamon and nutmeg.   More chocolate with a touch of black licorice. Aromatic as if it were peated, but it’s something else. Green grass and dried hay. Blackberries, raspberries, boysenberries with a light mint. There is a slight soapy note at times but it doesn’t detract from anything. 

The palate is sweet and densely fruity. Plums, apricots, raisins and cherries. Sherry and oak forward with a roasted nuttiness following close behind. Some peppery spice, but not bad considering the strength here. Cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and a hint of coffee with caramel and pancake syrup. Slightly tannic at times, but it’s a much needed contrast to the sweetness. 

A medium bodied mouthfeel that is a bit thin for a whisky this strong, mouthwatering and slightly astringent. 
The finish is medium long, fruity - mostly raisins, sherry, oak and toffee. 

The nose one this whisky was quite nice, and the palate didn’t fall far behind. Lovely fruity sherry and fruitcake flavors. Another example of why Glenlivet should offer more in the way of cask strength releases. 4.25 and thanks to @LeeEvolved for the sample. 
Cheers"
4.5,Sherry Bomb!!!
3.75,A nice dram however after trying the rest of the Glenlivet single cask range this is very young and a bit hot and rough. It's got good sherry bones but whilst drinking this I'm definitely hanging out for the 18 yr Torrain or the 15 year Mornish. Tough one to rate as on pure value at $60 it's a decent drop but then again it's not something I'd by a bottle of.

3.5,After sampling for awhile with other great scotch I'm going to bring it down a 1/4 point. Still good but there is a lot of competition out there!....Slainte'
