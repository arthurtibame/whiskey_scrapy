3.5,"I'm with romiastar on this one. WTF is the sherry? Sweet, lovely and inoffensive. Middle of the road slightly above average. I knew it was going to be as it's bourbon brother (which to be honest the sherry casks this has been in have been used so many times I'm not sure in good conscience you could attach sherry to the name) wasn't anything special. Neither is this..if you want Taiwanese go Kavalan (top end as bottom is average). Pass on this distillery unless you are into mediocrity."
