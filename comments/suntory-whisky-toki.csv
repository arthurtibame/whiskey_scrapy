3.5,"Nose: honeysuckle, pear, hints of apple, very faint scents of peat. Smells sweet like a bourbon. 

Palate: fruity and floral. Notes of apple and grapefruit. Some peat and earth, but not prominent. Mouthfeel is thin.

Finish: Dry and lingering. Oak and grapefruit. Faint notes of grain. 

Overall: GOOD. Very similar to Glenlivet 12 with a thinner mouthfeel and more floral/fruity notes. An available and accessible choice for those looking for a good Japanese whisky."

2.75,"The first Japanese whiskey that I've tried. The first thing you notice is how light in color the whiskey is. The nose is very faint with some vanilla, ripe green fruit, and a light lysol-lemon scent. The taste has a bit more of the vanilla with a little bit of a minty, pine flavor. This is super smooth, and the finish is virtually non-existent. I prefer a bit more of a punch with the taste and finish, but it is nice easy sipper overall."

You can tell this is a very young whiskey but that doesn't mean it's not filled with robust and distinctive notes.

4.25,"Hard to give this 5/5 based on each of my friends unknowingly suggesting the same thing upon my brag of the purchase of Suntory Toki: ""Oh, man. You gotta try Hibiki."" So the consensus is that Hibiki is the top notch, but Suntory Toki was my first Japanese whisky, as it is for many given it is perhaps the cheapest. I loved it. I could chug it, gargle it, savor it. There are various notes on the fruit side, but predominantly pear and macintosh apple (do not expect granny smith on this, there is nothing sour about it) mixed with a smoky, woody flavor, but said smoke & wood flavors are merely accents to the fruity, botanical ones. If you are searching for a new whisky around $40, do not settle for the same old- try Suntory Toki. This bottle is addicting in the best way."

3.5,"First taste of anything Japanese alcohol (except for some Sake back in the day). Nosing for me always brings difficulty. I do get a something that might be marshmallow, slight marzipan, etc. along with the green fruit of apples, pears and light citrus. On the tongue it is all lightly malted sweet candy with no discernible burn. Finish is medium but the sweetness remains. 

For the price this is such easy sipping. I'm sure the higher priced Yamazaki, Oishi offerings here in PA are worth the money. But for easy sippin' this is hard to beat. I'm a full two fingers into this 750ml and it is difficult to believe this is 86 proof. Feels more like 80 ... but it may have delayed hit due to it's light mouthfeel and thin weight, despite respectable legs in the Glencairn.

I put this in the same class as the Knappogue Castle 12 year in terms of cost, overall value and taste but I prefer the Irish for a few dollars more.

PA $40 but on sale at $36."

3.25,"Finished this bottle a couple months ago and into my foray of searching for my next whiskey I was reminded by how I enjoyed this bottle so decided to write my quick review after reminiscing. 
As a drinker of scotch and bourbon the first thing I noticed was how soft this was when first sipping it. Very inoffensive taste that went well with a small cube. Sweeter profile than any scotch I’ve had in the past. For under $30 and my inexperience in relatively pricier Japanese whiskies out there I certainly would recommend this bottle. 

9/8/19"
3.5,null
4.5,null
4.0,"Nose: vanilla, honey, caramel, lemon, orange, pear, slight cake malt
Taste: lemon, very very light peat, pear, apple, cake malt, honey, rosemary, parsley, 

I feel this gets looked over a lot because its a readily available Japanese whiskey and they let the hype take over. This is no Harmony or a single malt for sure and its a bit young, but it is good, especially for $30 or under. Treat it like a budget highland or speyside scotch rather than some mystical Japanese product and it'll be good"
3.25,null
3.5,"I reviewed this one about a year ago. Gave it a 4, but was pretty non-descript in my otherwise. Saw it on sale a month back and decided to bring this one back into the home bar. It was my first Japanese whisky back then, let's see a year of experience and an updated rating system change my original score.

Nose: Young and grainy. Lots of cereal. Big malt and toffee notes. Orange peel, green apple, vanilla, and honey. A pinch of black pepper and basil. Some almond and even shortbread cookie. Surprisingly a bit astringent.

Palate: More orange and now some grapefruit and lemon. Much more bitter than I remember. Big cereal grains. More vanilla and honey sweetness, with an artificial green apple Jolly Rancher note. A bit of milk chocolate and more malt. Both bitter and sweet, as well as young and grainy.

Finish: Orange and grapefruit still come through. There's more milk chocolate, vanilla, and honey, and then a burst of cinnamon, pepper, and oak. I get a soapy note somewhere along the way, and roasted nuts on the tail end. Moderate in length. Best part of the dram.

Not quite how I remembered it. It's fine, and it offers solid VFM. When I wrote my last review, I wrote something to the effect of, ""This was interesting enough to get me to explore the genre of Japanese of whisky."" And it succeeded in doing so.

After trying the Hibiki Harmony, I can't deny that that is head and shoulders above this one. To peg it at double the price of this Toki is fair in my opinion. This one hits  it's mark at its price point and is worth a shot. Definitely a worthy gateway to Japanese whisky, as it was for me. Great choice if you're looking to get into Japanese whisky or if you just want to try something new and are on a budget.

After a subsequent tasting, I was definitely a bit harsh on this one. Must have been an off night. Bumping the 3 to a 3.5."

3.5,"For someone who is largely a bourbon drinker this just comes across is totally different. First of all the color is a pale straw. I was surprised how much the nose hits me a foot away from the glass as pale as it is!

It may just be a mental association between the pale color and apple juice but that is absolutely the first thing to hit my nose. Bringing it a little closer I almost get an Apple cider vinegar. There is also quite a bit of sweet malt, something like I would expect from an Irish whiskey.  Sniffing and I seem to pick up something like new oak. I don’t get much in the way of anything nutty, earthy or spicy.

The pallet has a tingle of a burn but is largely overwhelmed by malty sweetness.  Mouth feel is pretty thin and the finish the short and dry. Now back at the nose I wonder if I pick up a little bit of heather and honey, but I could just totally making this up.

The second sip is smoother, with a little bit more of the honey sweetness coming across as well as maybe raisins or dried fruit. I don’t get much in the way of oak the first few sips but as I continue to drink on I feel like towards the end of the pallet maybe I pick up the Japanese oak?

Do I enjoy it? Absolutely!  Would I jump up and shout “this is Japanese!” Doubtful. Regardless I will enjoy finishing this bottle."

3.5,"This is the first Japanese Whiskey I’ve tried. I’m normally tasting Bourbons, so this will be a fun change. This was in a flight of whiskeys at a tasting.

On the nose I get green banana, some floral notes, and a little vanilla. This reminds me of Scotch. It also really reminds me a lot of Nelson’s Green Brier Tennessee Whiskey, which is a totally different category, but it is reminiscent.

The palate is a continuation of the nose. It’s a little sweet with some dusty notes.

This has a medium short dry finish, with some floral notes fading away.

Overall this was fun to try. It really does remind me of Scotch, though I haven’t had a ton of those either. It’s a fairly light and gentle whiskey and a good introduction into Japanese whiskey."

Lightly Peated Hakushu: Green Apple, Marshmallow, Vanilla, Pear, Mint, Citrus, Apricot. This is the Toki's main component

Chita Heavy Grain: Vanilla, Grassy, Corn, Caramel, Citrus, Marshmallow, Floral, Mint, Cotton Candy

Liked the Chita heavy grain component the most and the parts outweighed the sum."

3.0,"It’s Friday and the world is in utter turmoil.  Health, humanity and survival (economically) are on most minds (at least mine on this Friday, first day of spring).  Tonight a small, brief escape with a sample provided what now seems a hundred years ago by SDT brethren @LeeEvolved. 

It pours light-straw in color.  Now, it’s an later September afternoon. Not too hot. You’re standing in the middle of an Apple orchard.  That is the base aroma.  Pears and apricots mixed in with golden honey, tea, straw and a smidge of nutmeg. 

The palate and flavors are very similar to Glenlivet 12.  Sweetness of honey, vanilla, caramel, lemon, Granny Smith apples. There is a prickle of cinnamon and ginger spice near as it finds it’s way to the finish. 

The palate holds a finish of citrus grapefruits and orange zest.  Bits of wood and the bitterness of dark chocolate that lasts for, surprisingly, a good length of time. 

A simple bit of enjoyment at an extremely affordable price.  Aromatic and with solid flavors.  A good, light, easy sipper. Sometimes in life a bit of simplicity and straightforwardness can be rewarding.  In recent days like these, when you’re tired of thinking and worrying, a small escape, yet for a brief time, is sometimes the best tonic. [85/100][Tasted: 3/20/20]"

The Apple skins and pear continue into the front of the palate. Has a very sweet, puckery second moment, like the syrup from an apple pie. Touch of leather. The burn is there but really dovetails nicely with some cigar tobacco. There is a fruity pucker that keeps coming back.

The finish is more tobacco, with a touch of smoke that tastes like a match that just went out. All those fruity parts evaporate and leave some smoke behind. This is a deceptively complex Scotch clone, I'll be back to it."

4.5,"Another Japanese Whisky, another gem. This is the cheaper Blend from Suntory, but it is still made from yamazaki, chita and Hakushu, just as Hibiki is. 

Bottled at 43%, pale straw Color.

On the nose, it is very fresh,  with acetone, lemon peel, fresh lime, floral and chocolate notes. 

On the palate it is just wonderful, chocolate and toffee for a nano-second, then a strong tobbacco and dry grass note to end in this ultra powerful and spicy finish (clove and pepper).

The finish is so long it might just be the longest finish i have ever tasted in a whisky. Amazing.

Overall i give this dram a 94 over 100 and it is a must, specially for the price. Cheers!"

2.0,too much like scotch for my liking
3.0,"How time flies.  The first and, really, the only time I'd heard of Suntory was in the 2003 movie, ""Lost in Translation"" starring Bill Murray and the recent breakthrough actress, Scarlett Johansson. Over a decade later, in 2018, Johansson became the highest paid actress on the planet.  That very same year I began to treat whiskey-drinking like the spectator sport it is.  A re-encounter was inevitable. I started searching for new whiskies to try (and add to my collection), when I read about a Japanese one with a familiar name,  'Suntory'?  Then it dawned on me, that's a real life whiskey!  In 2003 when I had watched the movie, I assumed that this was a fictionalized brand. Still, I relegated the real life Suntory to the back of my mind, just as I had done the film.  There were just too many bourbons, scotches, and other alternatives to try first.  That is until recently, when @jonwilkinson7309 and I discussed a sample trade. Jumping out of that list was a Suntory, as attention demanding as the gleam on a katana blade.  I didn't think twice - didn't even resist... 'Sign me up!'  

Now going into this, I had high hopes. [Not that I'd hope about much if I smoked dope.... isn't that the obvious reason people get high.... the apparent absence of hope?.. most of the time, except when I'm not drinking, I just hope to get high for free.  But that probably isn't going to happen..  crooked health insurers.]  Yeah, I thought this would be all gang-busters, shoot-em outs with one Yakuza clan going after another.  But the reality was not so.  

On the nose: orchard fruits and vanilla. Youth also appears as ethanol.  Youth then rears its head on the palate as well. It tastes hot, hotter than the stated 43% ABV. The flavor comes across as almost citrus-y at first sip.  DOH!  The alcohol heat, however, drops the initial citrus lollipop deterring it from turning effervescent. Follow on sips bear the palate and brain toward apples, pears, and vanilla.  The higher ABV doesn't add much body, as the mouthfeel is a tad watery, but it does add to the heat. (Is it hot yet?) The finish is actually medium in length with a bit of drying woodchip.  Adding water flattens the palate and body, but cools the heat down while muting the wood notes.  Very fleeting, and one-note.  I attempted to pull more flavor or texture out of this with a big swishing sip.  But that still eluded me.  It was very much like trying to tell a cat to 'Stay'.  Good luck with that!  True, this is missing the sophistication of a deeper-aged single malt. But, perhaps, I'm being overly critical here.  All in all, a decent, light summer dram. I dare say, as an alternative to a traditional Old World whisky -- you could do worse.  While the memory of this sip will get lost in the fog of time, the memory of the film and the Suntory brand will continue.  Thanks @jonwilkinson7309 for my first encounter with J-whisky. I enjoyed the exchange!  Tasted from a full 50ml sample.
