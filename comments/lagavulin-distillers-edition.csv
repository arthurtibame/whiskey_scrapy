4.75,"I didn’t give this a 5 because there has to be something more out there.  Something ridiculously rare and extremely expensive and therefore “better”.  I haven’t found it but I have to believe because if not, the search is over and who wants that?  
It’s all about the hunt!  I don’t necessarily know what I’m hunting but I press forward... Endlessly.
I haven’t had a Lagavulin that I didn’t really like, it’s my brand of smoke, the sherry finish adds more on this one than it subtracts (to me).  If you like Lagavulin, you’ll (most likely) enjoy this.  If you’ve never had Lagavulin, I’d suggest starting elsewhere in the line."

5.0,"This is classy. Great balance of peat and full bodied sweetness. The peat is more mellow than the standard 16, but still let's you know this is a Lagavulin. Treacle, dark chocolate, almond. Long and strong on the finish. I tried the 1998 / 2014 edition"

Palate: thick and creamy on entry. Sherry notes of dark fruits, malt, honey, barrel spice, tamed smoke, tar, molasses and brine. Just an amazing, smooth, delicious dram of whisky. Not overly complex...its just joy for your tastebuds in a glass."

5.0,"I never thought anything could be better than the Lagavulin 16. But this is. Yes, it’s still 16 years old, but the double maturation has improved an already fantastic richness, mouthfeel, and flavor. On the nose, the smoke is old and musty, much like an old cellar that caught fire 10 years ago kind of thing. There is also some dried fruit, particularly raisins on the nose from the PX Sherry casks. This whisky is incredibly smooth and almost instantly you can tell that this is a level up from the standard 16. It’s richer and more elegant. The smoke is similar, but appears to be more “grown up.” There is this tar quality on the palate, similar to when they repave new roads. The finish is long and smooth. If you are used to the standard 16, this Distiller’s Edition offers more developed flavors with new prospects. The finish comes back to the classic Lagavulin flavor, so it’s like the whisky shows up and says “hello I’m more mature than my counterpart, but I’m more mature and don’t fool around, but don’t forget I’m still a Lagavulin.” This is the perfect expression of Islay in my opinion. Distilled 2001/Bottled 2017."

Finish: light smoke, tobacco, like a dry red wine, toasted orange peel, medium-ish length but then it lingers ever so slightly for a good while

3.75,"2018 Edition

Nose : The nose is characteristic from Lagavulin, with smoke a little less present, but sweeter. Figs show a little bit in the long run.

Taste : Smoke is less intense, but feels way more present than the Lagavulin 16, but sweet, not peaty. The smoke mixes with a tobacco ting. A feint presence of fruit can be felt, but it’s too feint to really enjoy.

Finish : Finish is long, starting with an important malt presence. The smoke than gets back roaring taking all the place, staying up to the end.

Unfortunately less good and less balanced than the previous releases"

4.5,"nose: mainly smoke and peat.  tiny hints of sweet fruit, tiny hint of oak.  the nose was gentle with the alcohol. I didn't catch any stray fumes that made me recoil

taste: an initial burst of sweetness gives way to peat and smoke.  there is a bit of saltiness if you look for it in the background   this is a viscous whisky with great mouthfeel.  it is not very tannic. mouthwatering. smooth. 

finish: long finish with peat initially, which gives was to fruit.  after the fruit is gone, it finishes with some sea salt.

4.25,"I'm probably stating the obvious, but just like the Lagavulin 16 with a wonderful layer of dried fruit, particularly raisin. It works extremely well with Lagavulin's usual earthy BBQ  peat with a hint of sherry - the PX cask finish amplifies the best aspects. Instead of a bonfire, this is a fire that has been put out by dried fruit and is now smoldering. It is better than Lagavulin 16, but how much better depends on your love of sweet peat. I think it's worth $15 more than the usual Lagavulin, but not much more than that. This is unfortunately a bit overpriced as I usually see it at $110 at best compared to $65 for the normal Lagavulin. I got it for $83 so I'm happy, but your mileage may vary depending on the price as it is only slightly better than the already wonderful Lagavulin 16."

4.5,"A very sophisticated drab. The smokiness of the regular Lagavulin 16, mixed with subtle fruit flavors. Very smooth and easy to drink. That being said, I’d still take the 16 over this one. Not as bold and much more expensive."
4.5,Fantastic addition to the Lagavulin brand!
4.5,The classic Lagavulin smoke with some additional spice. Delicious!
2.75,"Odd to see just one place to review the distiller's edition but many to review the 12 year.  Anyway

Nose - bananas, cloves, sweat over ripe fruit, vanilla, and an ever so subtle touch of smoke.  I'm getting a touch of mint as it opens.  

Taste - Unlike the nose the taste brings in the peat in full force.  Still I get that banana, and some over ripe fruits.  Now I'm getting the clear and distinct sherry flavors.  Then the char and roast and smoke from the peat.  

At the first the 43% and the just general fake coloring and kinda poorly merged sherry and peat didn't work for me.  Now that the bottle is half way and it has been able to breath, it's pretty solid.  Still the 43% is disappointing and it really does hurt this whisky.  Still the bananas and some of the notes are a bit young tasting for me."

The extra maturation in the Px casks really allows the base 16 to thrive. The smoke is there, as is the salt and iodine but it’s mellow and layered with the fruits and sugars of the extra Px cask contact."

4.25,"I'm really conflicted with this one. I love Islay. I love Lagavulin...although the Offerman offering really bothered me. The standard 16 is up there with Ardbeg Uigedial for my favorite single. I'm also not a fan of most sherry forward scotch. 

With that background I'll say the Distiller's was disappointing while at the same time also great, since I unfortunately have to compare it to the 16 and Uigedial as reference points. This edition is a toned down version of the 16 when it comes to smoke, earthiness, salt, and meat but it brings up the lightness of fruit and some sweetness. The initial taste is light and almost empty until some of the barrel kicks in with faint wood and high quality sherry. The sherry influence thankfully does not drown anything out but unfortunately also does not build huge depth and sophistication like it does in Uigedial, playing off the peat and smoke. In Distiller's, it helps highlight some plum, figs, and chocolate notes and really eases the dark, rich smoke. I just wish that it happened at first sip and lasted throughout. There's a caramel or marzipan richness that is present towards the end as you exhale. In this one the smoke builds up at the finish and lasts a bit longer than the 16, in a good way. It's like a small peat fire was extinguished with plum juice and still smoldered a bit.

Overall, I really wanted this to blow me away but it didn't. I almost see this as an amazing alternative for someone who drinks the 16 and says, ""that's too Islay"" (I've never heard someone say this but would never drink with that person again if they did). I appreciate the sherry mellowing the smoke and peat but still long for what makes Lagavulin....Lagavulin. 

It's a delicious, complex sipper that is definitely worth a try. Honestly, right now I'd still take the 16 over this one, especially at $30-$40 less a bottle. This is the fruitier, less bold version and that might be appealing to many people. I will happily continue drinking this bottle and will gladly update my impression as I look forward to working through it. I'm giving it a 4.25 for good reason, but for my taste, this doesn't deliver in the elite range for me."

5.0,"Nose - same distinct, gentle Lagavulin peat smoke, but even more subdued. The smoky, musty, briny undertones of the original 16 are obscured beneath deep fruit tones (plum, black cherry), caramel, mild nuttiness (pecan/walnut/cashew?), and even milder cinnamon.

Taste - smoke, but less than the classic, caramel, walnuts, chocolate covered raisins, plums, sweet cream, port wine.

Wow. Wow. Wow. Wonderful expression of the brand. After multiple tastings, I’m raising my rating of this to a perfect 5.0 (the only one for me so far). It’s beautiful and deep and complex. There may be scotches that are better for my taste, but I haven’t come across one yet."

The sherry notes are evident on the nose, along with that great Lagavulin smell. The sherry finish really takes over on the palate.

4.5,"When betting on buying good whisky without evee tasting it before, it doesn't get any safer than picking a Lagavulin. Their whiskies are always amazing and elegant. I have had quite a few of their ""Distiller's Editions"", and this 1995 expression (16yo, bottled in 2011), is a little less peaty and much more sweet. 

Bottled at 43% abv

On the nose: Fresh oranges, perfumed Peat, a Citric overall aroma. Grapefruit and Chocolate fudge.

On the palate, it is a little watery. Chocolate  and vanilla. Mild pepper. Meat.

Aftertaste is just amazing. The best part. Peat, Salty. Mouth numbing.
So pleasant, so refined. Powerful Peat. 
Ashy and full of Spiciness.

Overall this is a great dram. All the sweetness from the aroma and palate dissapears in the aftertaste to show the powerful peatiness from it. Nice experience. 92 over 100."

2.25,"Cold fruity peat on the nose, intense but not too strong or overwhelming. Cinnamon, milk chocolate, tin canned fruit cocktail, in fact really quite metallic - all in all really nice and smooth. 

The palate arrives sweet and bitter - only after a short while it become slightly alcoholic and then on the long finish sweet and sour. There is licorice (not the sweet kind) and barbecue sauce. The general taste is briny and fruity sweet with a very mature and prominent peat. 

Quite an interesting dram. For my personal taste it is a bid to rough around the edges but I can definitely see how it appeals to Lagavulin fans. But that’s the thing - I reckon you need to be a fans of this very unique taste to fully admire it. I personally can’t really approach it - I like the initial nose and and the first arrival but in the end the whole experience is a bid to bitter and the peat style isn’t for me. Too smokey and cold ash-flavored. While it is deep and rich I miss complexity and unity - everything floats away from each other."
