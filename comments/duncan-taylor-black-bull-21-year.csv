3.5,"On sale at I believe 100 bucks....ok lets see what we have here.

Nose - Cereal, vanilla, and a hint of a red note - there's some wine casks in here. A very nice and lovely nose but non discrete across the board. 

taste - I can't lie, there's something about blends I love.  They are so sparky and complex and varied. This is no short coming. I get just a whole world of notes. So for you grain haters, yeah I can taste grain whisky.  They claim it is heavy malt but there's a LOT of grain in here too.  Now grain whisky gives me a lot of cereal and vanilla which I get here so those aren't bad things. I get so many fruity notes, but nothing I can pin point. There's a lot going on and I just acn't do this justince.

I'm sorry all I can't give good notes here. It's a blend of blends of blends it feels like to me. Think highland and speyside fruity and oily and full of a lot of different casks. Citrus and vanilla forward with a grain after taste. 

If any of that sounds good, buy it if you can do the 150 retail. Even if 150 is high and that sounds good, get it.  This is great whisky"
