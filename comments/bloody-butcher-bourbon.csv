4.5,Tastes like scotch
1.75,"Appearance: deep gold with extremely thin and sticky legs
Nose: Fresh cut grass.  The youth comes through for sure
 Taste:. All heat and sweet corn. Mellow mouthfeel with a lasting back of the tongue bitterness.  Strong hit of cinnamon and peppermint.
Overall: Not a big fan.  Basically a dyed white lightning.  Doesn't bring a flavor punch to a cocktail, and the flavor doesn't stick around long enough for to enjoy neat.

 Drank for free at airport lounge.  Didn't finish."
