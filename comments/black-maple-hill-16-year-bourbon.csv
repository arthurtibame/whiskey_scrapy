5.0,"Very full and incredibly rich. This stuff used to be readily available, but the bourbon craze has left the supply dry. Such a shame because this was near the top of what a bourbon can be."
5.0,"One to obsess over. Very smooth for the proof level. I get a little salt at the front end and a hint of smoke on the back end. A little sweeter than Blanton's, but not in a bad way. Likely a different barrel than the reviewer tasted. Need this in my collection."

5.0,"Unfortunately, this whiskey is obscenely priced for it's quality. While it is a 5 star whiskey at $75 at the nearly $500 most people are chargning it is not."
