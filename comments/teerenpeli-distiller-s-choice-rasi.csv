3.5,"The background to this on is it's been maturated 6-8 years in bourbon casks and finished for one year in Moscatel casks . The word RASI means badly burnt KASKI fuel and it´s an old farming word. well that's an interesting name for a whiskey, I'm not too sure if they are trying to lower people's expectations or not! the second Scandinavian whiskey tonight, I perhaps have done this backwards starting with a cask strength and moving on to this 43% dram. again quite a different unique profile from the typical scotch or really any other country whiskey. I think i prefer the younger smogen which had more character,  this was initially quite muted. Baked apple and oak are the only official tasting notes on the site. Initially I perceived not much more than that but you do get eventually the sweet moscatel flavours rising to the fore, citrus, spice, sultanas. I'd rate it higher but for a really odd throat lozenger (the manuka honey type) note and short finish."
