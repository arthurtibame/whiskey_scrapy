4.5,"While in quarantine, i decided to open one of my samples, and i got to say i didn't even know how much a full bottle costs, which i believe it helped me to write this sample without any hype of the price. It actually costs around 1500 dollars (i have seen it for less in some auctions) and there are only 2017 bottles of it (or at least they were). 

Bottled at an astonishing 63.2%abv, this is so well crafted that you really don't perceive it is that high in alcohol by volume. Golden color.

On the nose: red chilli, vanilla essence, Bloody Mary, Peat, grass, cigar box, dark chocolate, caramel, sulphuric notes also appear, bronze, metalic, lime, and hints of smoke. SO COMPLEX. 

On the palate, it is delicious. Old oranges, chocolate, dulce de leche, maraschino cherries. There is this aroma of the cortex of chocolate brownies that you smell when baking them. Amazing stuff.

Aftertaste is powerful. Maybe too powerful. Ginger, peat, grass, cigarrettes, tobacco, wasabi, mint.

This whisky shows us how complex a dram can be. I don't think it is worth 1500 dollars, it would be fair at $250-300. Still a great, complex dram. My score for it is 92 over 100."
