3.25,"Not bad, just different. To me, it has a little heat, but cinnamon-y, not peppery like a rye. I’m glad I got to try this."
3.0,"Very fragrant, can smell it just holding the cup. Earthy notes, like mushrooms, truffles, dirt, in addition to the more classic caramel. some fresh linens as well. On the palate, some of the earthy notes transfers. Sharp, some herbal honey, a hint of the standard Beam cherry. The spice lingers but the rest of the finish is relatively short. I'd say this is a success in terms of experimentation, you can tell there's a different grain in the mash bill. 7/15/18"

4.0,My favorite of the Signature Craft series - surprised this isn't rated higher. Can definitely smell/taste the nuttiness. Really enjoyed it.
