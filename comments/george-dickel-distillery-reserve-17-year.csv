5.0,"Standard Dickel high corn mashbill.  Sweet on the nose. Sweet taste, not as much of the Dickel mineral. Definitely more oak than Dickel is used to, but not too oaky and I feel it balances it quite well.  Overall this Tennessee whiskey is great and much better than I expected. It is pricey, but it is truly one of a kind. Easily one of my go to drinks right now.   

Also, I think these are extra barrels are from right before they shut down production. Dickel was over produced in the 1990's so they quit production very late in the 90's. Reopened in 2003. Caused a shortage of #8 in 2007. Don't be surprised if they ""find more barrels"" and we see some even older limited releases in the coming years."
5.0,"Dear Mother of God, this whisky is something special. No burn to speak of, whatsoever. I sipped some when we got it at our store, but haven't touched it in the few weeks since. The palate had slight notes of char, some light spices (cardamom and possibly clove), a nice oakiness, and a vanilla fudge taste that lingered well through the exceptionally long finish. The mouthfeel was enveloping and velvety in the sense of a lighter merlot. If you can get a bottle, don't bother collecting it, do yourself the favor of tasting the best whisky to ever come out of Tennessee. I only wish we had managed to get more than six bottles..."

2.0,"3 star but downgraded to 2 on price. Very smooth with maple and vanilla as expected. The problem with this 17yr is it's past its prime. Flavors fall flat and the additional age brings nothing new except thinness. I really enjoy the 12 because it's tasty, simple, and unpretentious but this one is a major disappointment. I had big expectations but that too fell flat!"

3.0,"Smells of vanilla and marshmallow and oak with an almost scotch smell.

Taste vanilla, oak, light smoke, slightly bitter. 

Easy to drink but not the flavor characteristic I care for."
