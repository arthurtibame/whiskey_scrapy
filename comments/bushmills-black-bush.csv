1.0,Same evaporating black pepper as original but louder.
4.25,"Very heavy, full and rich contributes to the dark color. Spicy and fruity flavor."
3.0,"Found this at a small liquor store for $12/375ml. This is good Irish whiskey. Poured neat, noses apples and pears with a milk chocolate sweetness and some mild oak. Palate is more of the same with chocolate covered pear, some nice malt and light barrel. Its pretty tasty. There is a grain component that holds it back a bit despite the reported 80% single malt content. Finishes long with lingering dark chocolate and some malt with toasted oak. Overall this is much better than the standard white label and holds its own with some higher priced choices......80/100...... That said I had this back to back with the glorious Redbreast which is far superior (in cost as well)"

4.0,Step up :)
3.5,"Definitely got an interesting sherry twist, but beneath it is this odd vegetal note"
3.25,"This is my baseline whisky. Probably the first bottle I finished by myself (twice, I think,) and only now do I realize the sentimental value and the balance. 

To basically start with exclusively beer and then take it and say “I’m drinking this now” is pretty interesting considering how many harsh/polarizing/less than ideal spirits there are out there...
But Black Bush is exceptionally approachable. Nice in a chilled glass neat or with ice. If you want a novice starter bottle, I’d say this is my recommendation. Approaching four stars and up signifies I could drink these and lose track - and with Black Bush that was easy even before I became a full-fledged whisky drinker."

4.25,"It’s like butterscotch, wonderful neat sipping"
3.0,"Solid Irish whiskey, would say that the sherry cask comes through on the nose with a dark stone fruit , combined with malty character. Hits the palate sweet and malty too, with undertones of fruits and a light finish. It’s worth the money to upgrade to black bush from the typical bush mills."

2.5,"A- slightly more then ‘middle of the road’
N- gentle iron whiskey, but I don’t get the standard apple/pear notes. I smell tennis balls. 
T- standard Irish whiskey with a bit of charcoal taste. It isn’t smoky - but it also isn’t buttery like a Jameson’s. Slightly okay with leftover sherry and bourbon notes - which makes sense since it’s aged in them. 
M- slightly oily. Coats the mouth but very lightly. Dissipates quickly. 
O- not my fave. I like whiskey with a bit of a sweeter side - bourbons and the like - and this is getting closer to the scotch side. It’s clearly not scotch - but it’s not soft and buttery like Jameson’s. It reminds me of a flat, bland whiskey. Oaky and taking notes from the barrels - without it really being forward. Don’t think I’ll buy again. I prefer Tullamore or Jameson (regardless how standard it is)."

4.0,80% single malt blend! It's heavy metal with a great drummer. Probably a tease to what Bushmills can really do. 🤟🏼

3.75,"I like this whiskey. My immediate reaction was very little alcohol burn despite it being 40%. I get a lot of oak in the taste, vanilla in the nose. There's not much of a finish; once you swallow, it kind of disappears. But definitely smooth enough to enjoy neat."

3.5,"Ah, Bushmills. The proverbial forgotten middle brother of the major Irish whiskey trio. On par with Jameson and Tully, and at times, the best of the three. Yet it gets a fraction of the love and repute. Here, we have the Black Bush, which is basically Bushmill's answer to Jameson Black Barrel. Let's see how it stacks up.

Nose: Big on the fruit. Pear, apple, strawberry, raspberry, and orange. Vanilla, honey, frosting, malt, and toffee. A sweet one for sure, with very pronounced sherry notes. More malty than grainy, but I'm still getting some of the cereal notes. Shortbread cookie; an Irish standard. Slightly metallic. Not a trace of alcohol.

Palate: More fruit. Pear, apple, apricot, and orange. Still some of the red fruit. Cranberry, raspberry, strawberry. More of the vanilla, honey, and frosting. Some caramel and graham cracker. Shortbread cookie, malt and toffee. Walnut, cashew, and almond. Still slightly metallic, but it's even less prevalent here. Some cinnamon and baking spice.

Finish: Fairly short. Red fruit lingers, until it is replaced by cinnamon, baking spices, and oak. Oak presence is at its strongest during the finish. And it's over in a flash.

I've always liked this one. I think this one can go toe-to-toe with Jameson Black Barrel. At every level. And it's a few bucks cheaper to boot. Both are decent, youngish, sherry cask-aged Irish whiskies that are easy on the wallet.

Like the Black Barrel, this gets a 3.5 for me. At $35, it's a solid value. Other than the low ABV, short finish, and slight metallic notes, there's a lot to like here. It's sweet, easy-drinking Irish blend that seems to me to have a respectable malt-to-grain ratio. Good offering from Bushmills. Keep these guys in mind as St. Paddy's Day draws near."
2.75,"Quintessential Irish whiskey, prefer this to Jameson. Sweet, touch of vanilla, easy to drink neat."
4.0,Blind tasting
4.25,"Nose: Lots of vanilla and honey. A little caramel and maple hiding in the background. 

Palate: Very smooth and nice creamy mouthfeel. Initially raisins and dried apricots. Then some nice grainy/cereal notes come through. Overall not super complex but very smooth and tasty. 

Finish: Typical long grainy Irish whisky finish. One of my favourite things about Irish whisky and this is no exception.

This is also VERY delicious in an Old Fashioned and at its price point is a fantastic cocktail whisky."

3.75,"노즈: 옅은 과실(씻어놓은 사과의 향) 가까이갈수록 바닐라향
팔레트: 과일꽃의 옅은 상큼함  옅은 단맛, 약간의 스파이시함과 몰트의 맛(견과류맛) 복합적, 매우 부드러움
피니쉬: 옅은 나무의 향, 꽃잎을 먹은듯한 옅은 향과 맛"

2.75,"The nose is Moscato. Drinking it, it tastes like a watered down version of Bushmill's 21. There is plenty of sweetness with a rich backing of toffee and orange mixed with apple cider. It's not on the same level as Bushmill's 21, but it is actually quite good. The depth could be greater, but the flavor is mostly solid. For the price, this is a great choice. This is a good, cheap Irish whiskey, but it is most certainly not on the same level as Glenmorangie The Original. Compared with Glenfiddich 12, the flavor has a stronger alcohol kick and less creaminess. The Glenfiddich has a come in-sync concert of flavors, even if none of them are exceptional. The Bushmill's flavors are not bad though; the punchy fruit is enjoyable and the finish is nice. I would sip this, but it wouldn't be my first choice.
The odd taste aside, this drink is rich, sweet, viscous, and highlighted by orange and a tiny bit of yeast. This is quite like an American Single Malt, but I wish that bitter taste were replaced by a bit more depth.
The flavor is young with an unappealing bitter backing behind the nice orange, malt, and cinnamon sweetness. For the price, it's a good drink, but I would rather drink something better. The obvious non-Bushmill's comparison is Glenmorangie The Original. Glenmorangie has some more complexity, but a stronger alcohol presence. Overall, the Glenmorangie has a better flavor, landing slightly in the enjoyable-to-drink category. This is perhaps a little creamier. The good Bushmill's flavors are in there, but the bad bitter backing and young finish hold it back a lot.
The flavor is richer and has a cleaner finish (somehow :( ) than Green Spot does.
That allusion to apricot and the smokey flavor are what make this drinkable. Otherwise, it is bitter with an alcohol flavor. It has more problems than Green Spot does, though it is also more robust.
There are some nice flavors here, but it is far more biting than Green Spot and is even farther from Bushmill's 21. It's barely sippable. That bitter alcohol backing is too much to overcome. There are bits of licorice that are interesting but also add to the bitterness. Imagining it as licorice makes it a lot more palatable though. This gets bumped up to a 13 upon the realization that the bitterness is kind of licorice. Otherwise, this is a tough sell, despite some of the beautiful flavors it contains.
This smells more floral, less rich, and more like alcohol than Bushmill's 21 does. The flavor is far less full and is weighted more toward the alcohol and arbitrary spices, though the floral notes do show up and gradually drag in some unexciting fruit. The Bushmill's 21 far outshines this. 10x the price though? Questionable for sure. It would be interesting to try aging this awhile - maybe some time in a mason jar with oak cubes is all it needs. As it stands, there's just too much here that tastes off.
This has a big flavor of richness with that Irish whiskey oiliness that is so unappealing, but also vanilla and apricot and honey and spice. There's a lot of potential here, but it needs more time in the barrel. 12-13 seems reasonable. On a bad day, it could be 11. It isn't quite as good as Dalwhinnie 15."
