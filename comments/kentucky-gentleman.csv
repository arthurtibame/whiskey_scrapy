2.25,"Smooth going down, but has a significant alcohol burn in the end. Even still, it is worthwhile as a mixer, particularly because of the price."

2.5,"Got a pint of this for $4.32 at the local shop,  and it is what it is, quick vanilla frosting flavor with no lingering aftertaste good or bad.  The burn on this is nowhere near as bad as I had expected, for four dollars and change it's just fine, honestly in my opinion it's about as good as JB white label and costs 3 dollars less."

2.5,Not bad for. 75cents a pour. Had it in the Drury Inn hotel.
2.25,"Had for free at a Drury Inn in Bowling Green, Ky. Overly sweet with little bite but not flavorful enough to pay for. Malt, caramel, vanilla. Little mouth feel and no aftertaste. Not terrible for free well liquor, but wouldn’t be interested in trying again."

1.0,"Appearance: The color I found in this blended American whiskey is the same as caramel syrup. Its legs are thin and semi viscous; the image that comes to mind when watching the legs ease down the edge is from the movie Up, when Russell is dragged across the blimp’s windows for a good while.

Nose: On the nose, though as a whole a bit sharp, I find notes of creamed corn, wheat grains, Sharpie marker, slight caramel, polyurethane, rye-like fennel spice, and oak.

Taste: The palate is very bland, but what I did detect were notes of apple peel, cranberry, old candy corn, and Sweet Tarts candies, 

Finish: Right of the heels of the swallow, it bites then fades into a medium length finish.

Thoughts: With this American blend containing 51% straight whiskey (considerably greater than others I've had) and the remaining percentage neutral grain spirit, I'm surprised the experience didn't increase as well. If anything, this dram was worse than others in this already low caliber category. I wouldn't get this again except to convince an alcoholic to go dry. Sorry if that's harsh, but Barton Distilling, I'm not a fan. Here's to you and better products! Cheers!"
