3.0,"Sometimes brilliant and sometimes mediocre, with sudden changes occurring within milliseconds, this was a whisky I wanted to love but only could come away liking. The nose is better than the palate, with orange zest and caramel notes leading the experience until the proverbial baton is passed to unpleasant bitterness. It's too bad."

4.0,"Part of a sample set from Master of Malt, so I can only go off of initial impressions. That being said, the nose on this is alone worth the price of admission. Bread pudding with raisins, orange zest, toasted almonds, creamy vanilla sauce. Now I want dessert. The palate matches up, though perhaps not as full as the nose might promise and the finish is shorter than I'd care for. Still, an enjoyable dram...I'd call this a 3.5, but no harm in rounding up, eh?"

4.0,"Un nez vert, sur l’agrume et le floral d’abord, puis qui se révèle sur plus de rondeur et des épices. Très agréable.
En bouche, l’attaque est légère et fraîche, puis vient bien enrober la langue et le palais, sur des épices bien marqués dans quelque chose d’assez gras et crémeux.
Finale agréable et fruitée, un peu sucrée comme sur du caramel d’agrumes avec une pointe d’épice."
3.0,"As a nice long Thanksgiving week comes to a close, albeit all to quick, a bookend whisky from @Generously_Paul from the SDT will be the scotch that says goodbye November and welcome December. 

A copper color of a fresh fresh penny sits in the glass. 

A fresh opening on the nose of vanilla pudding and some of standard sherried attributes: raisins, dates, plums.  Nehi Grape soda with a touch of nuttiness and woodiness is detectable. 

There is a gentle sweetness of vanilla, honey and cream soda.  What was once sweet turns mildly spicy of ginger, cinnamon and cayenne pepper.  A creamy texture delivers these flavors.  As the flavors fade and work towards the finish, some semi sweet chocolate chips and orange bitters. 

Those bitters carry through the finish. Some caramel and vanilla sweetness seeps through with some oaky dryness. A nice soulful warming ending closes the dram. 

This is a decent scotch that is better than most.  This could easily be a workhorse, everyday dram if it was more accessible and a few dollars cheaper.  Sweet and spicy, like most I have tasted, but not overly so.  Not robust, but not drab either. [84/100][Tasted: 11/26/18]"

4.0,"Great bottle for beginners and fan of whisky. Taste is not too strong on the oak side and delivers a smooth and rich, almost sweet finish. Beginners will find it easy to drink and fans of whisky will find a nice deep whisky to explore and understand. Nice Balance."
4.5,"Beautifully smooth and complex whiskey. Not smokey, not too sweet, just smooth, couplex and tasty whiskey. 

Lives up to the flora and fauna series with floral notes, including highland mosses and dark honey."

3.75,"Nose: orange peel, dark fruit, brown sugar, Christmas cake, rich and deep. After a few sips, the sherry notes ebb and are taken over from the bourbon notes
Body: thinner than you’d expect but very pleasant, slightly spicy at the back, zesty, slightly dry
Palate: more bourbon than sherry, definitely orange zest, less sherry than you’d expect from the nose and slightly less rich, woody, floral and herbaceous hints, very surprising after the nose, menthol notes developing into the finish
Finish: medium finish, slightly woody and spicy, somewhat dry

Not what you’d expect and develops over time, funky"

4.25,Buttered toast on the nose. Brown sugar palate fully bodied finish that you can follow down your esophagus
3.75,"Nose: Plum pudding, clootie dumpling, Christmas cake - anything with big cereal, fruity and sherried qualities. There's also malt extract, cigarette tobacco, leather and buckets of orange zest (it's a dark preserved orange aroma - not like fresh orange juice). As it develops, the nose acquires notes of black Chinese tea (Pu-erh or Keemun - it's not as smoky as lapsang souchong), a fermented hay note, and way in the back the scent of oak cask. It's a big, full nose.

Palate: Rich, creamy full-flavoured arrival. Spiced teacake, malt, dark earthy fruits. There's a strong sherry note present but it's dry rather than sweet - more amontillado or fino than oloroso, and certainly not PX).  There's a smoky touch to the palate but it's not peat - ah! it's that Chinese tea again! This morphs into a cup of strong espresso with a twist of bitter orange peel, bittersweet dark chocolate, and walnuts on the side.

Finish: Medium. Malty with a lingering bittersweet and dry aftertaste. The dryness of a dry sherry.

A whisky that brings Glenfarclas somewhat to mind but it's drier, and there is less complexity and more density of flavour - I can only wonder what this would be like unchillfiltered, uncoloured and at 46% (probably wonderful). There is a notable heaviness to the texture, even at the comparatively low proof, and it is a satisfying dram. Don't add any water - it ruins it.

This is the backbone malt in Bells blended scotch, which I happen to like a lot, so that probably accounts for my affinity to it. In many ways Blair Athol 12 is like Bells ""perfected"" and without a grain element. It's a good whisky, and if it was about 25% cheaper it would find a permanent place in my cabinet, however as it stands it does not quite rate 4 stars.

Tasted from a 30ml sample.

""Good"" : 3.75 stars"

3.0,"Stop number 105 on the SDT is Blair Athol. A Diageo owned Highland distillery that is primarily used in Bell’s blends. This 12 year old from the Flora and Fauna series is one of the only single malt bottlings available. Bottled at 43% ABV and is chill filtered with colorant added making it a dark amber color. 

The nose has strong sherry and sherried fruits. Raisins, figs, dates, berries and plums. Some artificial grape and root beer notes that come and go. Honey, vanilla, syrupy sweet at times. Musty/damp oak, slightly minty, anise and licorice with a touch of maple. Salted chocolate and hazelnut, basically Nutella. Tobacco, a bit of cough syrup, pie crust and something odd, like the inside of a brand new shoe, good though. 

The palate has a strong but welcoming tobacco note, followed by a little spicy oak and semisweet sherry. Chocolate, toffee, vanilla, licorice. Ginger notes, herbal and some oranges oil. Plenty of raisins and dates as well. 

A medium light bodied mouthfeel that is oily and mouthwatering at first, but turn dry. 
The finish is medium length with darker sherry notes, tobacco, vanilla, licorice, raisins and turns slightly bitter towards the end. 

Not bad, but not great either. The sherry notes just seemed a little too dark, as if it were over cooked, if that was a thing with sherry. I’d rather stick with Tamdhu or Macallan if I wanted a sherried whisky. At $55 it’s not a bad option though. 3.25-3.5
Cheers"

3.0,"This is another Flora & Fauna bottling from Diageo:  Blair Athol 12 year.  This highland distillery was founded in 1798 and originally called “Aldour”.  It closed the same year it opened (lol, not a good sign) but reopened in 1825.  They produce 2.5 million liters annually for Bell’s blended whisky.  This 12 year is the only aged statement, distillery release they have.

It’s copper and gold in the Glencairn with runny legs and big, watery droplets forming around the edge of your spin.  It’s bottled at 43% ABV and I believe it is chill filtered and has lots of added color.

The nose is sherry, caramel and raisins up front with faint oak and orange peels rounding out the backbone.  The palate is very bitter with lots of peppery oak notes.    Mid sip you do get some relief in the form of orange marmalade and light sherry sweetness.  It’s still slightly abrasive, even for a 43%-er.  The finish is somewhat short, with oak and sawdust notes that start out oily but turn rather dry.  

What starts out very promising doesn’t materialize on the palate.  It’s way too harsh with a quick finish that oaky and ultimately dry.  The color is borderline ridiculous- it’s almost Dalmore-ish.  A clear indicator that too much E150 has been used here.  Thanks to my buddy @Generously_Paul for providing this sample, but I’m having a hard time rating this higher than 2.5-3 stars.  It checks off another distillery, but I don’t think there’s a reason to look for anything else from these guys.  Off to the blends with ye!  Cheers."
3.0,"From my understanding, I think Diageo has these Flora and Fauna series for their ‘ unusual and off-the-beaten track malts’. (If I’m wrong, our resident auditor @Generously_Paul will set me correct).   This one is courtesy of @Scott_E as part of our final round in our little tour.  Decent nose....sherry influence of dried fruit hits you right away.  Palette is where it shines though...a tinge of earthy sooty smoke and dried fruit.  Good pour.  Would I buy a bottle?  Nah.  Would I buy at the bar?  If I’m curious...but, I’m not curious anymore.  So...no.  It does though make me curious of other offerings from this distillery, especially a bit older and mainstream.  It has good DNA, and I’m sure some more time in quality casks would help.  Thanks Scott!"

3.25,Well it's an improvement over the sickly sweet Gosling Rum I just had. It's got a nice initial taste of viscous caramelized orange peel but I'm with Joe_C on this one the bitterness compromises the dram. 3.25 for me.
