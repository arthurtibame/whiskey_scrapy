4.25,"Part of the Infinity Barrel Benefit Project. Bottles were blended from retailer buy-backs during the COVID-19 pandemic and blended into a new select product. 

Color: deep copper
Nose: port and apricots with notes of vanilla cream
Palate: I let it rest in the glass for about 10 minutes. Smooth bodied with a notes of chocolate and plum. Rye is subtle in this one, coming through more in the back with the warmth in the swallow. 
Finish: The rye carries through. 
Overall: Really good. I’m a big fan of Catoctin Creek’s line in general and this is no different. My wife is not a fan of rye or whiskey in general because of the burn from most, but this was mellow enough to make her a fan."
