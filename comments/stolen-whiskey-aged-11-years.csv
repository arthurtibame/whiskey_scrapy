4.0,Ive been waiting to see this whiskey added. One of my absolute favorites! Exceptional for the price point. Sweet and smooth. It’s the smokiest whiskey I’ve ever tasted.
4.5,Way way better then I expected. One of the bette low cost whiskeys I have had in this price point. The finish is really nice reminds me of buttered Carmel popcorn. High rating is based on taste and drinkability to value
3.5,tastes just like the Holmes family homemade vanilla ice cream
3.5,Tasted like campfire marshmallow flavored whiskey. Smoother than I expected.

1.5,This is exhibit A if someone makes the claim that age statements lead to better whiskey.
3.0,"Overall, it’s fine. I tried it neat on multiple occasions and can’t get over a kind of minty finish. Other than that it’s ok. I enjoyed it. For the price, I there is way better out there."
4.0,"This is a sleeper whiskey that doesn’t disappoint.

About half the price of Balcones Brimstone, and I may actually like Stolen a bit more (which is no slight to Brimstone, a great whiskey in its own right). 

Wonderfully rich vanilla nose. Refined smoke comes through on the palette. Someone described this as S’mores around a campfire, which is spot on. A fun way to cap off an evening. 

The 11 years in the barrel were time well spent. Outstanding value and a unique sipper. Give it a try."

3.25,"Very spicy, better off as a mixer but ok straight"
4.0,Very unusual taste I cannot even explain.  It’s slightly weak for my taste but it was so different in a good way I had to give it 4 stars.  Definitely worth the $.  People love the bottle when they see it in my bar and it’s a great talking point.

0.25,"The nose pops with marshmellow from the start. The pallette is a mess of burnt marshmellow, scalded brown sugar, and a oak finish. How bad could a 11 year whiskey be? This bad."

3.75,"Vital Stats: 92 proof. 46 percent alcohol by volume in a 750 milliliter bottle. Corn whiskey aged for roughly 11 years in used barrels at MGPI in Indiana and then finished with a second aging in toasted barrels for about 28 days.

Appearance: Burnt copper, chestnut.

Nose: My first whiff, I get hints of toffee, chocolate and a bit of sour oak. As I sat with it, I detected more of an element of dried dark fruit. The nose bouquet reminds me of a complex wine.

Palate: At first sip, I’m hit with a toasted oaky taste that softens into a sweet, syrupy molasses flavor. The whiskey has the hints of smokiness people have come to expect from Stolen Spirits, but more delicate than you might expect.

The whiskey has a buttery, creamy texture, leaving a nice coating in your mouth. Well balanced with a smooth finish, spices like nutmeg and a slight vanilla flavor lingers at the end."
3.75,Current go to for Old Fashions. The hint of vanilla mixes well for a well balanced Old Fashion that's sweet as much as it is deadly.
3.5,"If you don't like finishes or whiskey that's stave finished don't buy this. If you do continue reading. You may like this.

N:Sweet, smoky (think wood smoke not peat smoke)

P: still sweet but the toasted oak notes start to pull forward. The marshmallow mention on the bottle tag begins to make sense. For me I picture sitting at a campfire either watching them melt into the flames or making smores.

F: Sweet burnt wood, pit BBQ, smooth but does have spicy burn 

Well balanced overall. Rating reflects versatility and less the quality.

As stated this is not a purists whiskey at all but a treat for the adventurer. Would pair with BBQ, hiking and a beautiful campfire in the mountains. Cheers!"

4.25,Excellent whiskey. Smoke flavor is great reminds me of sitting by campfire and sipping on a nice glass of whiskey like a cowboy back in the Wild West.

4.0,"Nose - Caramel, Some tartness but sweet like raspberry and light smoke.
Taste - Sweet, Smoke and a dark chocolate bitterness when swishing around it has a freshness to it. 
Finish - Has my mouth salivating like after eatin a caramel cube and wanting another sip but leaving me parche"

3.0,Very soft nose. Butterscotch. Spicy all the way through. Slow and long finish.
2.75,"A bit of research provided an interesting history behind this one, which was graciously provided by @jonwilkinson7309.  

This was a brand started by two guys in Auckland , NZ ( hey @Soba45...your neck of the wood.  Well a bit up north).  Their first product was rum.  They then got an infusion of $21M from a US brand, afterwhich they started this whiskey.  

They bought this 11 yr old from MGP, and further aged it a whole 28 days (???? Seems odd to me... not a month.  Not a week...but 28 days)  in charred oak barrels, to provide a smokier flavor.  

So at first whiff, you get toasted corn.  Almost like popcorn.  Taste:  really corn heavy, a tinge of smoke.  I’m not a fan of full corn based whiskey, so take my review with a grain of salt.  I find them generally sweet.  There’s a slight bitterness at the end, which was surprising, cause it’s not a young whiskey.  

Anyway, for $35-40, it’s a valiant effort.  You can’t do much better at that price tag.  

Thanks Jon for the pour!"

Definitely a mixer."

1.75,"Smells like marshmallow,  but a strong smell. Tests extremely smokey.  Pass."
3.5,"A mysterious label, with a surprising drinkable (albeit sweet) bourbon inside. You're not going to blow away the Whiskey Snobs or entice the Whiskey Collectors, but if you want to satisfy the true blue bourbon toothed Whiskey Drinkers, Stolen Whiskey has got you covered in spades."
3.75,"Smokey American whiskeys always catch my eye.  I'd seen the Stolen 11 here on Distiller some time ago, but wondered if it was nothing more than a gimmicky marketing effort.  Whiskey from MGP, along with a slightly ham-handed moniker...

But I saw it at Binneys a couple of months ago, priced at just less than $40.  Smokey American...Worth taking a chance on.

It was $40 well spent.  It's vanilla, creme brulee, and marshmellow.   There's also a nice mint element to it as well.  The smoke, while subtle, provides a nice contrast to the sweetness. And at 46% ABV, there's just the right amount of heat.

This won't appeal to those who dislike sweet drams.  But if you're OK with that, there's enough balance and complexity to keep it interesting."
3.25,Sweet vanilla cream and smoke. Had this the other day with @brandymcnamara.
3.25,"Easy on the nose. Taste has strong notes of cream soda and vanilla. Easy finish. ""Sweetness""  is a bit high for my taste."

4.5,"This is my first Distiller review, even though I've read hundreds (if not thousands). I'm not really the reviewing type. Therefore, this is going to be the shortest - yet most accurate - review you've ever read about anything in your entire life. Don't believe me? Read these 3 words, and then taste this whiskey: Smoked crème brûlée."
