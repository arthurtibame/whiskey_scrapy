3.5,"Instantly, Oban 14 on the nose. 
The palate is medicinal, bitter and spicy.
The finish is medium long with some medicinal aftertaste and some sweetness in the very back."

4.0,"It’s like an average of HP with all the flavors but nothing dominates. A little more of the Bourbon barrel aromas are present, such as toffee, and less fruit. This is probably my least favorite of the travel series. 91"

3.75,"Pleasant, but not as good as the classic Highland Parks. Some smoke and spice, but doesn’t last very long. A whiff of tobacco leaves, like smelling an empty cigar box. Still, could be drinking much worse..."

4.0,"Yep yes yes. Very smooth, maybe slightly boozy, but very nice. Vanilla, wood, dry flowers, we are on a warm whisky, but superbly done"

4.25,Buttery. Smooth. A little sherry mellows it out. A good dram.
4.75,"Sweet, got a good cherry smell to it, an spicy aftertone, that lingers medowly on the tounge"

3.5,"Ok just like Kilchoman STR didn't stand a chance against Ardbeg 19 year back to back (damn it Ardbeg I really want to hate you for stupid pricing and fast whiskey fashion but you do it so well..sigh) this was destroyed by the Springbank 21 which preceded it.

In summary another HP vaporware NAS which isn't a NAS. I would weep at what HP has become if I cared anymore but i'm long past that and into acceptance stage also because I can rejoice as I have an old 18 yr batch awaiting to be pillaged.

Drink if free, don't go seeking as to be honest would you even remember what the hell the name is...so many stupid variants..."

3.5,"This expression feels like it could be from any destillery in the world. It has no character, no personality. Not to say it tastes bad, but it's definitely not what I expect from HP. 
VERY DISAPPOINTING.
You will be much better with the classic 12 than this..."
4.25,Picked this up in the duty free at the Dublin airport in 2018.  Very smooth.  Lightly smoked and just a hint of peat.
