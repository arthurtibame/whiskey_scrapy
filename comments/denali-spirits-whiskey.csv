2.5,Average. Sweet and bready in the nose. Smooth. No finish
4.5,"This is a bold flavorful easy drinking whiskey. On the nose I get caramel, vanilla & dried fruit. The flavor profile is more complex. The vanilla caramel & dried fruit give way to oak, toasted grain, and a slight smokey finish. Easily in the top 5 spirits I’ve ever tasted"
