3.0,"Nose: grape juice and smoke

Taste: light peat and spice"
3.0,"Distillery tour today. Andalusia Whiskey Company is located in the beautiful Texas Hill Country about an hour from Austin or San Antonio. They do all their own smoking of their barley, as well as age and bottle on site. Among Texas distilleries, they get a lot of press, and have been featured in Texas Monthly and Whisky Advocate.

Maybe it was because I was drinking Ardbeg last night, but I was hoping for more with this peated whiskey. Maybe it's the fact that American single malt should stick to its wheelhouse, and smoke their barley with what's nearby their distillery. Andalusia's Stryker does this, and stands far above this one, which is smoked with imported Irish peat. It's good, but a bit thin. Reminds me of Connemara, which I believe I rated similarly. This one took a PX finish well, which was another distillery exclusive, and helped round out some of the thinness in the peat."
3.75,"Andalusia Revenant Oak

Nose: apple and white grape juice, vanilla sugar, caramel cream, buttered shortbread, damp grain field, 

Palate: sweet malt grain, smokey honey, ripe orchard fruit medley, white chocolate, ginger and all spice, smokey Texas oak funk intertwined with and earthy woody peat. 
Finish: long and luxurious. Barrel spice, creamy leather, white grape juice, tobacco leaf"

4.25,"Nose is actually very delicate for a peated whisky but the peat is the strongest along with the barley vanella and Carmel some sort of fruit if you dog hard for it like a red apple

Palate: Carmel and vanilla up front that moves to a spikey Texas wood flavor followed by the salty peat finish. The finish isn’t incredibly long but takes its time. ( keep in mind I did not add water)

Although it’s not as round with that intense middle a solid peated malt.
I also appreciate the brand being a true Texas whiskey and not miss leading about using sourced whiskey(which they don’t) looking forward to trying more of their products"
