3.75,"Many whisky drinkers will point to this as their launching point into scotch, which is fair enough as I too started my journey with Glenmorangie 10 along with Glenfiddich 12 and Johnnie Walker Black Label. But it wasn’t until i revisited Glenmorangie 10 many years later that I truly appreciated what a wonderful scotch this is. Many people will say that it’s just an easy sipping dram that offers light fruity notes, but the more time you spend with it you really get to  appreciate what a wonderful whisky this is."

4.25,"This is a great ""social"" whiskey.  Its simple, not harsh or off putting, smooth and is exactly what I picture a good and honest Single Malt to be.  Yet, it can be had at such an affordable price point that it can be enjoyed while having good conversation about anything other than whiskey."

Palate delicate but fantastic. Citric fruits, nuts, delicate malt, sweet.
Love the finish, although many say it is short.
Best seller Single Malt in Scotland for years."

Palate equally sweet. Just wonderful, but I am a novice single malt drinker."

3.0,"Nose: Honey, vanilla, and candy orange 

Taste: Floral and oranges are the main notes. Very round and simple notes. Not of a lot of nuance"
4.5,"This has turned out to be one of my favorites.  The citrus, honey and a creamy finish... it's complex enough with a great balance of taste and scent."
