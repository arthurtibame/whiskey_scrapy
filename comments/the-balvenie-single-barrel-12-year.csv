5.0,Once again Balvenie has created an unique experience. My first impressions are light  on the nose with hints of sweetness and butterscotch. The taste is again sweet with familiar  notes from the balvenie family. Good neat or on the rocks.

Think caramel or vanilla, and it sets the mouth-feel for the dram.  A sweetness comes with the alcohol.  Overall, it's got a fullness, some sweetness.  This isn't a heavy hitter, but for what it does, it's definitely an enjoyable drink."

4.0,"In the glencairn, the whisky is pale gold, like midwinter sunlight. The newly uncorked whisky's first and most obvious aroma is that of unripe, green banana. Further in, I discern hard cider, fresh pineapple, light vanilla, and desert lime. The palate reminds me of a Gose; and like the beer, this single malt tastes salty and yeasty, while its maltiness is sour. More patience reveals sage, banana cream, and lemon poppyseed bread. The midpalate is toasty and malty, and the finish is wonderfully salty, warming, and elevating. The aftertaste adds to the panoply of flavors hints of espresso and cinnamon. This dram has an astonishing complexity and is one I'm so glad to have the whole bottle to enjoy. Also, Kory and I often wait to open new bottles till we're together, and we never share notes till we feel comfortable with our initial judgments. We both put 'unripe banana' as the first note for this one. So contra the naysayers, no, beverage tasting isn't just subjective nonsense."

2.0,"Very light in color. The nose is fruity, I get mostly pears and maybe some apple, all tied together with an underlying vanilla note. Hints of malt are there as well. The juice pinches your tongue, you taste the fruit that was on the nose, although the vanilla didn't seem to transfer as much. There's a charry, smoky bitterness (some sips I swear I get peat), and towards the end of the dram that will be the dominant note. It's pleasantly sweet throughout, and there's a rush of spice that lingers for two seconds, before disappearing in the relatively short finish. 4/14/17"

4.0,"A light gold appearance. This is classy and delicate from nose to finish. Fluffy vanilla cream, freshly baked biscuits, and a drizzle of honey. The palate is creamy with delicious light malt, and more toasted biscuits with vanilla and honey. The finish has mild spices and a nice dose of charcoal smoke. Still my favorite Balvenie to date."

 I tend to like sweet and fruity and smokey. Bowmore 15 year Darkest Islay is my jam for comparison.

 For $9 a glass I'd almost rather drink Tullamore Dew, which I know isn't the scotch but it's a daily drinker and it's almost as good for about $42 a bottle in Michigan. Another speyside (?) single malt I like is Glen Moray Elgin 12 year Classic which is just as good, maybe more floral and a little sweeter... probably a better price. About $55/750 ml here. Gotta check Balvenie prices but it's not common in backwater Michigan. Hey, we're not Hicksville Oklahoma, but it's the Midwest, vs. LA, Boston or NYC."

4.5,"My bottle: Cask #9153, Bottle #170

Nose: Licorice, cherries, bubblegum, pine-resin, apple cider, pears, vanilla blossoms, marshmallows, barley sugar, sweet melon and mint.

Palate: Delicate honeysuckle nectar arrival. In the development it gains texture and there are orchard fruits, malted barley, honey, sweetened vanilla yoghurt, caramel pudding and baked apples, all sprinkled with delicate sweet ginger and a dusting of white pepper.

Finish: Long, a fruity spiced-mead flavour dwindles away joyously.

Oh, a brilliant, bracing nose. Top stuff! Tasting this whisky is like stepping out into a mild spring day. The palate is a masterclass of how to handle a sweet profile without allowing it to descend into syrup - a stunning example of how first-fill bourbon barrels can sympathize with the right distillate.

I had to force myself to add water to this, I was enjoying it so much neat, but I'm so glad I did. The nose softens and swells with gentle oak that was previously obscured. The palate develops more spice (ginger and cinnamon) and more honey.  The finish is rounder and longer lasting.

It's excellent both neat and with a few drops of water - do try it both ways but water is definitely not needed simply for dilution - this is super smooth at 47.8%.  It's expensive for a 12 year old but worth every cent.

""Excellent"" : 4.5 stars"

4.0,"Paid $59 (on sale) for this bottle. This is a bottle kill review. I will try to summarize what this bottle offered. 
                
                Nose: Nice changes with oxidation in the bottle.  This started off with green apples, vanilla, honey, and too much oak.  Then, it became juicier and fruitier.  Towards the end, the apples are joined by wintermelons and cantaloupes.  This bottle lasted some 7-8 months.  Maybe I should have left it out longer?
                Palate: Very green, and fitting for summer.  Limes, cumumbers, wormwood, held up by the balance of sweetness from typical Balvenie honey in the mid-palate, before becoming grassy and bitter.
                Finish: This is a great whisky until the finish.  It’s malty, woody, and minty.  Meh.  The complexity on the nose is more like a 15-18 year.  The finish is just par for a 12 year old.
                
                To compare Balvenie to a car brand: it’s Infiniti.  I mean, c’mon, is it really luxury?  I’m not buying it.  But, this is a pleasant surprise in the line-up, as a fairly priced whisky that demands patience, and will not appeal to the masses.
                Pros: Great summer whisky.  Gets better after being opened.  12 years in first fill strikes a great balance between wood and spirit. 
                Cons: This was playing way above its age statement, until the forgettable finish.

Paid $59
Sale price.  If I can find this again for a similar price, I will probably restock.

Much better than the standard DoubleWood, which was friendly and predictable on opening, and just went downhill to become frail and flaccid with time.  This single cask first fill bourbon 12 year started out awkward and autistic; but blossomed into a well-composed, crisp, and highly enjoyable sipper.  Green fruits on the nose.  Vibrant honey, green tea, and Juicy Fruit gum on the palate.  A delicate smoky finish.  This bottle definitely improves over the months.

Very sweet, like fruit and flowers in Spring, little to none of the smoke, peat, or common tannins or brine. This is a pure scotch, clean and fresh without anything over the top. balanced, easy drinker that is far better cold. If you let it sit in the glass you'll reveal some of the harsher alcohol tones. Solid drink that will also make you appreciate the affordable NAS blends on the market."

4.5,Wow!  Strong apple/pear on nose and palette...  with a bit of spice on the finish. More narrow than many of The Balvenie expressions (but still grand). This speaks to the breadth of possibilities of The Balvenie new make spirit...

2.0,"Strongly disagree with the Distiller flavor profile: sweet nose (candy) but smoky palate. Intense finish, finishes like a higher proof expression. Very disappointed, tastes really young; perhaps because of the high proof. I like the DoubleWood much better."

4.5,"Balvenie has always been one of my favorites. This is one the best--maybe the best--of their expressions that I have so far tried.

Nose: It's distinctly grassy. Shortbread cookie, honey, vanilla, and cereal. It's oddly reminiscent of a quality Irish whiskey.

Palate: Vanilla, bananas, cream, and toffee. Relatively dry, but not in a bad way.

Finish: My favorite part of this whisky. The 48% ABV makes itself evident at this point.  It packs a nice punch. The oak is prominent. It's a lengthy finish that transitions from sweet to spicy before it finally fades.

Balvenie has done fine work with this one. It's strong across the board. Respectable strength, and as a bonus, it appears to be of natural color. It's a few bucks higher than I'd generally like to pay for a 12 year old, but in this case I think it's fair given the higher ABV and the quality of the juice. Well worth the money."

4.0,"47.8% abv
Non chill-filtered
Colorant possibly added

Nose: fresh. sweet and grassy. Honey; bright apple; some citrus, too, like pineapple and orange. 

Taste: sweet and sour. a little hot and astringent in the arrival, but then sweet mocha and acidic fruit; heavy vanilla and barley sugar.

Finish: medium length. sweet and acidic, with vanilla, hot cocoa, and a hint of white chocolate and salted caramel.

Value: $70-80 USD. Borderline worth it.

Final thoughts: I really enjoy this dram. It’s not an introductory single malt, but rather an altogether singular experience (it’s a single barrel, after all). I commend Balvenie for releasing a first full single barrel that’s readily available and affordable. Unlike bourbon, single barrel/cask releases are hard to come by. Grab this if you’re looking for a unique and at time challenging Speysider. But if you’re a beginner, grab the Balvenie 12 Double Wood first; it will help you appreciate this one all the more.

Score: 4/5 (highly recommend buying a bottle)

Malt musing: “Drinking can cause memory loss, or even worse, memory loss.”"

3.0,"Nose: oily, sweet, 

Palate: woody, oily

Finish: woody, sweet"
4.25,"The nose is delicious. Raisin, grapes, straw. A bit of salted peanuts.

Body delivers on that raisin and grape scent. Reminds me of a good sangria here. It’s bitter, it’s salty, and it’s tart.

Finish turns away from the bitterness and saltiness into a pure sweet raisin finish. That sweet finish is very long. It’s amazing. It sits on your molars long after the drink is gone.

I wish I could remember well enough what the doublewood 12 tastes like to give a proper comparison now. In a blind taste test about a year ago, doublewood 12 won, but I am enjoying this dram so much I find that memory surprising. This is a delicious, slow-sipping scotch."

4.75,"info: ce 12 ans est vieilli un ex fut de bourbon de premier remplissage. Chaque bouteille est une des 300 bouteilles issues du même fut. Une couleur pâle, sans colorant. Sans filtrage à froid non plus. C'est assez rare de voir des whisky si jeune en version ""single cask"". Pour avoir gouté 2-3 bouteille différente, les saveurs m'ont semblé constante. La liste de récompense est longue et récurrente. La plus récente étant ""Silver oustanding"" en 2017 dans la catégorie Speyside par ""international Wine & Spirit Competition"".

Nez: Beaucoup de vanille intense. De la crème, des agrumes, du citron, de la meringue, des amandes grillées dans le beurre. Le nez est juste magnifique! Un gros gâteau glacé à la vanille et au chocolat blanc.

Bouche: Belle intensité!Oon glisse sur la longue vanille crémeuse et je perçois bien les amandes ensuite et ça termine plus loin sur ene petite touche pointue en alcool. Belle texture grasse dans le verre! C'est onctueux comme liquide. 

Finale: Longue avec une touche fraiche (de la menthe? des fleurs?)

Overall: J'adore celui là! Pas le plus complexe mais c'est une belle intensité. Vous voulez un scotch vanillé et bien vous l'avez. Dans la catégorie du Hedonism de CB mais en un peu plus agressif sur l'alcool. Alors, je me questionne sur le rapport qualité prix. Ici en SAQ il est près de 141$ CAD, ce qui le place en compétition avec une tonne de bon whisky. J'ai trouvé celui-là à 98$ à Calgary, ce qui me laisse croire que le prix en SAQ est beaucoup trop élevé. Bref, pour 98$ CAD (taxes incluses) c'est une super bonne valeur à mon avis. Je ne pense pas qu'à 141$ CAD j'achèterai cependant. Ceci étant dit, il reste qu'il s'agit de l'un des meilleurs 12 ans que j'ai gouté et qu'il s'agit probablement de l'un des meilleurs scotch de cette palette d'arôme sur la vanille (dans cette gamme de prix). J'ai beaucoup de plaisir avec ce verre même si ce n'est pas le plus complexe. Et, pour ceux qui se demande s'il est similaire au Doublewood 12 ans: absolument pas. Ce n'est même pas comparable, le premier est près de la surdilution alors que le deuxièmement est révèle pleinement son potentiel aromatique. Je crois que cette expression est plus représentative de la gamme en général de Balvenie qui est selon moi une excellent distillerie. Finalement, je ne crois pas que cela soit un scotch de débutant dans le sens où la vanille n'est souvent pas l'arôme la plus facilement perceptible pour ceux qui n'ont pas le palet développé. Si vous savez que votre palet se sent agressé facilement par un taux un peu plus élevé que 40%, ce n'est pas pour vous non plus. La pointe alcoolisé n'est peut-être pas ce que les débutants recherche non plus. Pour ceux qui perçoive bien la vanille et les amandes de ce breuvage, ce sera un délice! Bref, pour ma part j'adore ce produit de Balvenie! (contrairement au doublewood 12). 93%"

4.0,"Very unique on nose and front tongue. Sweet and sour. Malty. Spicy and strong. Musty. Wanted to like this more. Will revisit as I drink the bottle down as I read it changes with oxidation. Also turns into a completely different whisky with water. Sour taste disappears and it becomes very sweet. I prefer it without the water. 

Update: chasing the 21yr Portwood with this and it’s holding up well. I’m upgrading the rating. The oxidation treats this well."
