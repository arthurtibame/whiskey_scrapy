4.0,"Nose - (w/o water) Hot sweet heat, intense vanilla caramel, cinnamon red hots, salted Spanish peanuts (w/ water) Greatly reduced heat, oaky peanut brittle, caramel, more salt

Taste - (w/o water) Hot oaky intense brown sugar/caramel sweetness, cinnamon spice, salted roasted peanuts (w/ water) More drying, cinnamon spicy heat, less cloying sweet, salted peanut brittle, dark toffee

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering heat, sweet oaky sugar, lingering cinnamon dusted peanuts (w/ water) Lingering hot tingle, cinnamon spice dominates

Score - 85/100

Final Thoughts - This is the definition of a Beam product in that it captures all of that peanut funk (but in a good way) of the Beam yeast. Nice dark sweet oaky caramel that packs a nice punch. Oddly this one did better and felt less ""hot"" without water. I think this one is best sipped neat or maybe turned into an old fashioned or manhattan with some black walnut or chocolate bitters for a nice nutty dark toffee flavor bomb.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - Not this particular batch"
