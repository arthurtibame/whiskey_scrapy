4.0,"Nose- Waxy apple, ginger, honey, toasted marshmallows

Palate- Ginger spice initially, wave of tropical fruits, honey, creamy vanilla

Finish- medium, creamy finish with notes of ginger and soft tropical fruits


Hmm. This is good stuff, but doesn’t blow me away. Lovely toasted marshmallows on the nose, along with waxy apples and honey. The palate coats the mouth in ginger spice, followed by muted tropical fruits and honey. Nice creamy mouthfeel, but the palate and finish feel muted. I think this bottle needs some time to open up and it could be great. Will revisit in a couple months."
