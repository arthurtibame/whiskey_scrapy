I get the bright mineral component, the grasses and burlap, even maybe the hint of peach/apple sweetness but it's really just young raw rye grain and a hint of oak. It's like a slightly aged High West Silver, with an appropriate ABV (vs High West's 67%). I really wanted to like it because it's local but unfortunately, like Dillon's Dry Gin, their rye comes off as the product of a young an inexperienced distillery. One that's working hard but not quite hitting the mark. $40 in Ontario."

3.0,"Not a bad whisky by any means but definitely not a stellar opener either.  On it's own it was a fairly mediocre Rye whisky, though it did mix well into a classic manhattan.

Not overly impressed by this first attempt, but it is great to see a small batch distillery releasing whisky, I'll be looking forward to what Dillon's come's out with in the future."

Refreshing summer dram!"

3.0,"This is a young dram which puts the alcohol and water up front. When I spend a little more time, I get and I teresting chocolate in the nose. Otherwise, it is light caramel on the  nose, cerel sweet with a herbal note and mild spice in the palate, wax, and some light oak on the finish.  Sadly it moved to bitterness fairly quickly too. The nose has promise. Maybe with more time."
