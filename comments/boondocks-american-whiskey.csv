3.5,"This is very good for what it is. Toasted almonds, cereal, and a medicinal overtone in the nose.  Sweet warm marshmallows and nuts at the front.  Very smooth transition.  It has an American malt flavor but it's very high in corn per centage.  I hit it with a bit of chilled distilled water and the fruit notes exploded.  I don't know where they were hiding but they should be unleashed. Short sweet very smooth finish.  I definitely suggest with a splash."
