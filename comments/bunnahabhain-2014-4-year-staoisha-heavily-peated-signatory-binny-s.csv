4.5,"My bottle is 60.4% not 60.2%. It’s wonderful. Opened the bottle and it immediately smelled like BBQ and peat. A wonderful combination. After a while I got a little bit of citrus. Amazingly smooth for so young and so strong. The palate was a lot sweeter than the nose would suggest. I normally don’t add much water but I figured, at over 60%, why not. It really opened up the citrus. I got more lemon than anything else. Very sweet on the palate. Maybe it’s just a surprise compared to the way it smelled but the fruit is really there. This was a neck pour so I’m looking forward to getting in this bottle. Very reasonably priced as well. Thanks Binny’s!"
