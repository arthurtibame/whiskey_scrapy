3.75,"Very silky on the tongue, great mouth feel. Nose gives a good amount of spice and creaminess, with a welcome sweetness. As is typical with wheat whiskies vanilla, caramel, butterscotch and a hint of Christmas spices pop on the palate. The sweetness slowly fades into a nice dry grippiness, with a somewhat long finish."
