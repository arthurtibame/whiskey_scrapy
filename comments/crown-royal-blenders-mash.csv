3.0,Not a fan of The Crown I am very impressed with the Bourban Mash. Will definitely get again
2.0,This... This is a perfect example of why Diageo needs to stick to scotch.

2.5,"Nose: Rye bread, 

Taste: spices, nutmeg, more rye bread, sour banana. 

Experience: this feels far more like someone trying to make a copy of Jack Daniel's rye than any sort of bourbon. Its cheap and for the price not bad but it is not any sort of bourbon. Strange because if it were I'd be much more inclined to the original name."

1.0,"Nose:
Baking spices 
Cinnamon
Citrus Peel

Taste:
Sharp oak
Slightly sour 
Tannin bitterness, like a way oversteeped black tea

Not for me. Tempted at several times to pour it down the drain, but couldn't stomach the idea of having wasted the money on the bottle."
4.0,"I liked it, I thought it was a lot like a decent US bourbon."
3.5,"This is ok for something different every now and then but I wouldn’t say it is a bottle I reach for first very often. I get heavy notes of charred oak on the nose and tongue with a hint of rye. It gets slightly sweet towards the end followed by a short light finish. 

Updated June 2019.... haven’t had this in a while and since have started appreciating bourbons more than I used to. That being said, I think it is much better this go around than before, and all I get is bourbon, no blended Canadian. I no longer think this was a waste of my money and it actually is pretty good for a bourbon. Those harsh flavors I seemed to find last time are no longer there. Don’t know if it mellowed out sitting in the cabinet but whatever happened, I’m glad it did."
3.0,"Easy front end, light kick on the back. Good basic whiskey"

3.0,I didn’t think it was all that good
2.0,"I bought this bottle at first as a collectible. This was originally labeled ""Bourbon Mash"", but after some complaints about using the word bourbon in an imported whiskey, the TTB changed course and made them correct the name. 
    
    As shipping, promotion and sales had begun, the TTB allowed Diageo to sell what they have, but the label needed to change. Hence the name ""Blenders Mash"", and my purchase.
    
    Big box retailer had for $19.99, so I figured I'll buy this, keep it behind the bar and tell guests the story. (like anyone but Whiskey geeks care).
    
    As the reviews came in, they were not good... I cracked the bottle.
    
    The nose is wonderful, sweet vanilla and caramel, a hint of cinnamon. Nice.
    Unfortunately that is the end of this. There is no taste. It is flat, watery, and almost green apple sour.
    The finish is non existent.
    
    I'm disappointed in this, I really wanted to like it. Crown Black is head and shoulders above.
    
    Afraid to put this in any kind of cocktail, as any additional mixer will totally destroy it.
    
    I'm managing to get the bottle down by telling friends the story first, then everyone wants a taste."

3.0,"It's a pretty respectable whisky. 

There's definitely rye on the nose, with hints of warm spices and peanut butter - it's an odd combination but it works. The palate has notes of cherry and charred oak with an undertone that is floral. The texture is a little thin and I hold the 40% ABV responsible, although the finish has some legs.

It's ok, and I'm going to agree with another reviewer here: it probably pairs very well with Coke."

2.75,"Made a killer old-fashioned. Lots of nice bold oak tones but it isnt like trying to swallow an old fire log.

By itself I don't see much here but will admit it was nicely smooth. The vanilla was nice--""grown up""--and not ruined by maple like regular crown."

4.0,"I don't know why all the hate for this? Yes, it's light. It's not going to blow any minds. But I've certainly had more highly rated whiskeys (by a small margin) that I consider more offensive or flawed than this.

On the nose, subtle notes of saltwater taffy and oak, a hint of caramel and a light whiff of nail polish remover, fresh cereal and a hint of butterscotch or brown sugar.

Flavor is light and refreshing. It reminds me of a less sweet version of Malahat black tea rum. The flavor is more brown sugar than caramel, a touch of new oak, applewood, black tea, fruit, and salt -somewhat scotch-like. Very smooth. Somewhat long, but uncomplex finish.

I may be somewhat biased, because I picked up a 375 ml bottle on clearance for $8. But I think the hate for this is undeserved. I suspect if you tried this blind, your find it we're a light, uncomplex, but otherwise enjoyable whiskey that would be hard to classify as a bourbon, Canadian, or scotch, but somewhere in between all three."
