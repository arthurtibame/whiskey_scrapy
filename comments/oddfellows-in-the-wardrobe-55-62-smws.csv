3.0,"(Royal Brackla)

I don’t normally like a Royal Brackla, but this is surprisingly good.

Upfront there’s some wood and spice - ginger, pepper and dried cinnamon.  As it develops you get more dried fruit, treacle and more of the spice.  There is a long, slightly sour finish that pleasantly numbs the palate.

With a drop of water it’s more of the same.  The wood is more present throughout, but with less of the sweet dried fruit."
