5.0,Bookers is my top shelf.  Love all of there offerings.  I feel they may have shot them selves in the foot with the price hike.  Let's hope they do the right thing.

5.0,"Oak on nose with some vanilla and caramel. The proof shows with a firm, friendly handshake. Taste has rich, full caramel, apple and well balanced oak that sticks through on the finish. This shit is delicious! Enjoy it more than the “Sip Awhile” version; which is delicious as well. This has less black pepper flavor for sure. Booker’s is probably always solid. I’ve only tried two so far but I see more in my future.

5.0,"As a huge fan of Booker's bourbon I love the Small Batch Series, and ""Off Your Rocker"" (2016-05) is one of best I've tasted.  4.5 stars out of 5.
            
       Nose: Smoky Oak, Vanilla, Butterscotch, Mint, Cherry Cola, Coconut, Herbal note.
            
      Palate: Oak, Butterscotch, Mint, Vanilla, Dark Fruit, Roasted Nuts, Cinnamon, Tobacco.
            
      Finish: Oak, Vanilla, Mint, Cinnamon. 
            
      ""Off Your Rocker"" (2016-05) has a beautiful nose that gets better and more complex with more time in the glass.  I get a lot of oak right from the start, along with butterscotch, mint, cherry cola, coconut and a faint herbal note.  After about 25-30 minutes in the glass the smokiness of the oak really starts to blossom, mixing beautifully with the mint, while the coconut has completely faded away. 
            
      On the palate there is a lot of oak (mildly smoky) with some butterscotch and roasted nuts, followed by a flood of heat containing flavors of mint and cinnamon and a slight herbal note.  Vanilla, dark fruit and tobacco emerge as the heat dissipates.  The finish is long and warm with more smoky oak, vanilla, mint and cinnamon.
            
            While ""Off Your Rocker"" can be enjoyed neat, I find that a little water really brings out the best this bourbon has to offer."

5.0,"$67.99 @ TW. 
This is one of the very best batches Booker's has put. Along with Bluegrass batch, this was the highlight of the 2016 batches and superior to all 2017 batches. 
Vanilla, oak, butterscotch and baking spices hit you upfront. The heat roars in the mid palatte with brown sugar and caramel. The finish is long with oak, and tobacco and again that chest warming heat. This Booker's is best served neat. Let it breathe for 10 mins and sip slow. You will be rewarded!"

Dec. 16

My kids have this movie they love where Lego Brainiac tries to shrink the planet Earth in order to complete his alphabetized collection of planets. Ultimately, the Lego Justice League is able to save the world by refocusing his compulsive collecting disorder toward collecting coins. But what happens when he finishes his collection? Lego Batman points out that this is impossible, since new coins are minted every year. Effectively, Lego Batman found a way to eternally imprison Lego Brainiac into a compulsive collecting habit which, to Lego Brainiac, may have seemed like a good idea at first, but over time his efforts would indubitably feel fruitless and his ever-expanding collection devoid of any kind of meaningful satisfaction.

Anyway, tonight I’m popping open Booker’s 2016-05, “Off Your Rocker.” 64.85%!

Nose is good, but not special. There’s caramel, and it’s super astringent (which makes sense). I’d say lemon too, in the sour/bitter form. After sipping for a while, I go back and can get a nutty scent too.

Body: wow that’s hot. Hadn’t had a Booker’s in a while and you forget. I get brown sugar, and tons of milk chocolate. Very sweet, very tasty. I like this a lot.

On the finish I get sugared pecans. This is one of the most delicious finishes I can remember. Appropriate tongue buzz, relatively short overall.

With ice: this tones down the bite a ton. Per usual, you barter some complexity for accessibility. This one fares better than most though, and I wouldn’t hesitate to alternate this bottle between neat and rocks pours.

This is in the running for my favorite Booker’s to date. I’ve only tasted 5 or so, but I have a feeling that number will be going up a lot in the near future. Lego Brainiac has raised the white flag.

‘Tis the season. I don’t know if I actually have 15 more new whiskeys lined up, so if you’re reading this and there’s something readily available out there you’d like me to enjoy/suffer through this holiday season, leave it in the comments."
