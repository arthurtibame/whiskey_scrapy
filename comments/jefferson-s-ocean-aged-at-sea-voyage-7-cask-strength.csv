4.0,"High proof,smooth taste."
3.0,"3.0 - $75 - voyage 16
Nose - spice with slight sweetness. Maybe raisins 
Palate - more spice
It’s fine but not worth the $75
I may even prefer the regular Jefferson’s"
4.0,"This little gem I found was surprisingly excellent. On the nose there were not a whole lot of notes I found besides being salty. However, the taste was bursting with salt, various fruits, and of course the cast strength pulled it all together. The cast strength did not over power the tastes at all, it accented them very well."

5.0,"Paid $89.99 at BevMo. 
I am reviewing Voyage 10. This is an exceptional Bourbon. Exceptionally smooth especially for the 113 proof. Upon entry you get rich caramel and burnt brown sugar. A pretty good spice kick on the mid pallette let's you know it's barrel proof and definitely a high rye bourbon. Finish is very long with some oak, tobacco and salt water taffy. Lovely pour that is for sure one of my favorite Bourbon's! Worth the price of admission and you definitely notice and taste the impact of the aging at sea. I would suspect this is a younger bourbon that the aging at sea makes taste much older that it is!"

3.75,"I love the story of this spirit but was not blown away by the taste. Compared to normal Jefferson’s, the taste of the Ocean aged reminded me of Woodford. It has more of the bright, spices flavoring than the vanilla, flat Jefferson’s small batch. Good drink, better story, not a bad buy."
4.0,Solid.  Can taste the brine a bit.  Wanna try it again but was nice to get a nip.  Thanks to Flint Creek
