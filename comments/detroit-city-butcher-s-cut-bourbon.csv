3.0,"Just a quick notes type review for this hometown bourbon. Tried it tonight at a minor league ball game. Not sure how well my nose was working in a ballpark with a breeze and nosing out of a 12oz plastic cup, but I tried my best. Other than its 50% ABV I have no info on this whiskey at the moment. 

Heavy oak and rye notes on the nose. The first thing that popped into my head was MGP, but I don’t think this is sourced. Dusty, a touch of orange, vanilla and heavy barrel char. A little mint and some perfume. 

The palate has strong musty oak, rye, peanuts, heavy barrel char and cherry cough syrup. Not bad for a young bourbon. The 50% ABV is both in your face and hidden at the same time. 

Medium bodied mouthfeel and dry. 
The finish is medium long with charred oak, rye and is dry. 

Not bad, I’d say that another few years in the barrel would help add some depth and smooth things out a bit (the oak was so strong it was like sucking on a bourbon soaked wood chip). Not sure what a bottle goes for but if it’s sub $40 it might be worthy of a buy. 3 stars. 
Cheers"

4.0,"Belated.  Abbreviated notes:

Super impressive for a 1 year craft bourbon.  Sweet.  Muted cherries and oat earthiness.  Rich.  Gentle proof spice adds balance.  Some barrel notes despite the young age."

1.0,"This “bourbon” needs more time in the barrel at a minimum. It tastes like drinking a glass of sawdust or licking a piece of fresh cut wood.  Reminded me of walking through the wood section of Home Depot (in a bad way).  I could be wrong on the aging, maybe it’s the hand smoking of the barrel instead of charring. Either way something is a miss here."
