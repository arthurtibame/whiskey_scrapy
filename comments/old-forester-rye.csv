3.0,Got this for a friend as he is a big rye guy.  Found it to be good not too complex but rather alcohol forward and some spice it is rather inexpensive and completes with some of the bigger brands like crown rye but with more of that single barreled smaller distillery authenticity. Overall probably wouldn’t buy it again but it’s good for the price point.  My buddy enjoyed it.

3.0,Just ok. Sweet and easy first taste. Has a flavor I can’t pinpoint mid palate that I didn’t care for. Slight burn on the finish. Has a bit of a fruity aftertaste. Will let it open up a bit then give it another go.

3.25,"Nose:  (3)  A bit prickly on the nose.  Ethanol and a varnish type smell.  Some vanilla and pepper tones.  Smells young, but interesting

Palate: (3.25) Vanilla comes through a little bit more, very rye forward like a slice of seeded rye bread which is pleasing. Some spice builds with some oakiness.  Spearmint then moves across the back palate.  A bit floral and yeasty

Finish (3.5):  Finish stays with you and is the best part.  It is dry and warm, all in all not bad.  A little bit of marischino cherry seems to come in at the end, I wish it were more.  Vanilla and fresh oak linger.  

Verdict:  This will make a great Manhattan.  For the price I would have a bottle.  If it were aged further it would be exceptional, but the youngness throws off the balance.  I am wondering what oxidation might do."

4.0,"A fantastic rye with an outstanding price tag. This is a perfectly SPICY and sweet rye that hits on all cylinders. Terrific nose of brown sugar, vanilla, lots of cinnamon and even some minty notes. Wonderful, long legs that go on forever. On the palate, POW!!! It lets you know that the mashbill is high rye but done right. Pepper, Cinnamon, Clove, definitely Dill and rounded out nicely with sweet, malty flavors. Long, dry finish... Sipped neat, as it should but I can see this doing nicely with a large ice cube or in a cocktail. Well done Brown Forman team!"

3.75,"Finally, the Old Forrester Rye has landed in the valley of the sun! I have been waiting to try this one ever since it was announced. The fact that Forbes proclaimed it as one of the great values in Whiskey only intensified my desire. Add on to this the overwhelming positive response to this dram, and I am sold. Does it live up to it's crazy hype? Let's find out...... but first the obligatory background!
This is Old Forester's first Rye Whiskey and first new recipe in almost 150 yrs. It features a unique Mashbill of 65% Rye, 20% Malted Barley and 15% corn. What makes it unique is the Corn is the 3rd grain. On to the tasting!
As it enters was really strikes me is the fact that the viscosity is a medium to high viscosity. For a sub $20 Whiskey that is outstanding! First note that smacks you is a big brown sugar note with a spice undertone. As we hit the mid palatte we surprisingly get punch of oak to compliment the baking spices (cinnamon) and some dark cherries. Finally the finish features some leather, tobacco and more.of that oak note that drifts to black pepper. 
Man, Old Forester's done it again. Somehow they have fooled us into thinking.this Rye is much older than it is. Much like the amazing 1920, this one clearly has some pretty skilled barrel management at play. This can't be much older than 4 yrs old, but the notes you get are only typically found in much older stock.
Now, given it's price point in isolation, I fully understand the hype. For sub $20 I can't think of another Whiskey that is better. Based on that it's an absolute hard buy recommendation. However, is it better than the baby Saz, Double Rye or even the Rittenhouse BiB? Its a tough call that would be primarily based on your own personal taste profile preference. For me, it beats Rittenhouse, is on par with baby Saz and is a notch below the Double Rye. However, it's also $10 cheaper! 
So in summation, is it a great value Rye? Hard yes!
Is it a good buy at SRP? Hard Yes!
Will it change you life or perception of Rye? No!!!
Cheers All!"

null,"Nose: This pops out of the glass. First notes mimic a banana split; banana, cherry, neapolitan ice cream, chopped peanuts, and whipped cream. But, then the malt makes it presence with Golden Grahams and watermelon bubblegum. Lastly, the rye finishes up with cracked black pepper and cinnamon candies.

Palate/mouthfeel: The mid-palate is super concentrated and focuses on fruity flavors. I can’t help but to quote Fred Minnick’s “Watermelon Jolly Rancher” note when he reviewed this. I get the same thing. Solid baking spices  alongside black pepper translate on all angles. All those wonderful flavors from the nose start dropping down under your tongue. 

Finish: Medium to long finish that gushes with watermelon, cinnamon candy, toffee, and cracked black pepper. This is honestly dangerous. 

I got a lot left in this bottle, and I have a feeling the best is yet to come."

3.75,"Neat. Nose is deep, spicy, woody, dark fruit, clove and pepper with mild ethanol.  Taste is sweet, char, medicinal cherry, vanilla, pepper, clove, and a touch of mint. The high barley gives is a thicker mouthfeel and a rounder sweetness that is atypical for the style. There is a bit of an alcohol byte, which is expected for 100 proof. Finish is decently long, sweet, cherry, and balanced with wood tannins.

If you're a fan of the bourbon version, OF Signature, then you will enjoy this.  All the sweet cherry with a big boost in rye spice.  Pretty intense for those new to bourbon and rye.  I could see where someone would think cherry cough syrup.  The interesting notes would make an excelelnt mixer.  Also would be nice on ice.  I've tasted worse for twice the price.  Great value"

3.5,"Alcohol burn hits first with the char and coal hints, this has a burst of nose burning heat and medicine right up front that is entirely uncharacteristic of a rye.  The spicy notes do present as it rolls back into the throat but the earthy tones of chocolate red forest fruit and orange bitter are always foremost with this very interesting dram. 

This is certainly worth a try for those who find ryes too often to be uninteresting and similar beyond a point of being a lot of green bottle clones of near identical rye spice taste.  The bitterness could easily be a plus for scotch enthusiasts and the odd sweetness a nice treat for the bourbon lovers as well.  

Not unlike the Jack Daniels rye that adds some sweetness to the profile often lacking in more standard ryes.  I find it a bit course for my taste but I can easily see a lot of drinkers taking to this somewhat unusual offering from Old Forester that just might grow on you over time."

An amazing new mashbill from the much revived Old Forester brand, this is one of the most interesting, flavorful whiskeys you’ll find at this pricepoint—the 1L bottling being an exceptional value in the market with great character relative to the price—hell, at any price."

Taste: completely opposite. Vanilla bomb off the start, rye spice and oak, lead in to a milk chocolate finish that ends a bit too fast. Awesome rye for how cheap it is."
3.0,"Kind of a weird bird. Clove, cinnamon and honey on the nose. Some upfront sweetness like a bourbon, with notes of black cherry and vanilla but then the herbals come out in the mid-palate hitting you with eucalyptus, clove, and lemongrass. Spicy peppermint finish of decent length. Little too herbaceous and medicinal for my palate. Great value for $19, but I’d probably rather pay the extra for High West Double Rye or Rittenhouse so not a rebuy for me."

2.75,"I am not a big rye fan.  I am an Old Forester fan however.  This dram is a hit and a miss.  It has a unique flavor profile for a rye.  It is not the usual suspect.  It also doesn't have the expected distillery notes from OF that I was hoping for.  Like most rye bottles,  it is painfully thin and lacks dimension.  It also lacks the normal cinnamon spice I usually find as a redeeming quality to rye.  However, there are no off notes or young flavors in need of taming.  It is not bad like Bulleit Rye, but not interesting like Knob Creek Rye.  However, for its price point of $25 in NC, I must rate it above $37 Knob Creek.  It just lacks the complexity and interesting flavors of Sazerac and High West offerings regardless of cost.  Again,  after a few rye nights to reset my palate, Bourbon tastes ohhhh so much better."

Appearance... Medium to dark copper, borderline mahogany...

Taste.... Utterly sweet brown sugar with a touch of coffee and chocolate. The rye is definitely noticeable and makes a perfect appearance. A leather and pepper note is apparent from the middle to finish and is a welcomed friend...

Overall... At $22.99/750ml it's a steal. Between this and Rittenhouse I've got the  lower cost Rye category covered and under at $26/bottle. This is an easy go to for a nice dessert type rye. Served neat and enjoying as I type..."

4.0,"I haven't had a chance to sit down with this one in the Glencairn yet, but thought I'd give my initial thoughts since it is new. 
On the nose this one is oak heavy. Fall spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, clove) and a doughy sweetness. The palate is sweeter than the nose would indicate. Think butterscotch with a heavy backing of oak spice which dominates the mid-palate and finish. There is the dried cherry note that I associate with other Brown-Foreman bourbons/ryes lurking in the background, but it is not prominent until you add a splash or a large cube of ice. It then makes its presence known with authority by dominating the entire pour, both nose and palate. I'm not a huge Old Forester/Woodford fan, but this one is very good, and the $25 price tag is a huge plus. Probably my favorite OldFo so far. I'm looking forward to carving out some time to explore this one in more depth, as well as try it in some cocktails."

Taste - Initially thin then builds up to a richer mouthfeel, sweet cherry, vanilla caramel, cinnamon spice, slightly herbal rye bread sweetness eventually emerges

Finish - Almost menthol/minty coolness on the swallow, light oak, fruity dark cherry sweet, cinnamon spice, flamed lemon zest with a bit too much pith making it slightly bitter but not unpleasant

Score - 85/100

Final Thoughts - This was quite good, didn't initially nose like a rye initially, but with some air time the rye spice does come out. Nice experience throughout with the exception of the slight bitter on the finish, but that's fairly minor. Nothing off-putting or distracting about it. Nice balance of sweet and spice, decent enough to sip neat and I can see this playing well in cocktails, but that'll have to see.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes

Would I buy a bottle? - Yes, most likely"

Alongside the fruit notes, there are strong vanilla notes alongside really light floral notes, caramel, clove, pepper,  and a rye breadiness. On the nose, this rye would not appear to be the spiciest despite having 65% rye in the mash bill. The taste is really sweet for a rye which helps bring out the vanilla and fruit notes. If you are craving a sweet, fruity whiskey this is a good go-to. The lighter notes get buried on the taste other than the floral notes, which helps to complement the fruitiness of this rye. The finish is where the normal rye notes reappear as the pepper rises up through on the medium-long finish.  This really has some nice complexity for the price and I highly recommend."

3.75,"I have several of the other Old Forester offerings and thought I’d give this relatively new Rye variant a try.

The nose has rye spice, freshly baked bread, butterscotch and red apple.

The palate is not very sweet, only slightly sweet with a spicey and creamy mouthfeel. It has rye, vanilla, and a hints of butter and black licorice. And some barrel. 
There’s a slight ethanol note.

There’s a medium-long finish with a nice lingering rye spice note.

Overall, a pretty decent rye. Especially for the price. I will add that it’s somewhat unique. Maybe because of the higher malted barley content? 
I need to do a side-by-side with other budget ryes (Wilt Turkey, Rhittenhouse, etc.)"
4.0,"Ryes still aren’t my favorite. However, if I had to drink one this is a solid option"
4.25,"What an interesting rye.
Nose: Elevated, and yet yes extremely complex and spicy. Home made whipped cream, clove, allspice, white flowers, raw honey and a hint of coconut cream. 
Palate: BOOM! Big whoop of flavor, but again everything is light and almost airborne. Rich cream, flowers, cinnamon, pink pepper, salt water taffy, fresh grass, vanilla and pana cotta. 
Finish: Long, but lingers in the throat and chest."

3.75,"Smells like a typical rye, but then bourbon sweetness notes come into a very light play. The initial taste is very refreshing, with the rye being light and building. Bourbon sweetness punches you right in the middle, and finally the proof becomes apparent with a spicy, full finish. Great versatile rye, so long as you're not craving that incredibly spicy, 100% rye flavor."

3.75,"This is a fun rye that is quite a bit different from your typical Kentucky rye, this one has 65% rye in the mash bill that gives it some extra spice! Vanilla and cherry mix together on the palate and a medium fry finish to end it. For the price this is a good deal and you don’t have to feel guilty if you use it in a cocktail or drink it straight.

3.5,"Ok so this is a little hot and maybe too youthful but man it packs some flavor for the $$. Poured neat, nose is fruited. Cherry,apple and raspberry lead the way along with bread dough and barrel. Ever smell a vacuum cleaner exhaust after someone put potpourri in it. This has some of that going on too with a dusty floral vibe. The palate hits the fruits again with cherry apple and berry on strong. There is a real nice malt note you just dont find in rye due to this unique mashbill.  Wood and sure even some rye spice add to the taste. Its a bit raw and sharp but still a good blast. Finish is raspberry smashed with dry oak and more of that malt sneaking in. Overall I find this very enjoyable especially at the budget price. Of course it could use more ageing and development of the flavors. I do think this is different enough from the other players and such a great value that I will be repurchasing on a regular basis....86/100"

4.0,"Nose: Oak, vanilla, toasted cereal grains - that malted barley shows up on the nose.  Warm buttered bread.  Grassy, vegetal, and herbaceous.  Classic clove, nutmeg, cinnamon.  Strawberries, Luxardo cherries.  Dusty corn.  The proof is helping this jump out of the glass without bowling you over.

Palate: Cloves and nutmeg, followed with brown sugar, oak, and those toasted grains again.  Dried thyme, star anise, dried basil, oranges, green bell peppers.  Luxardo cherries.  Artificial cherry - the stuff they use in medicine.  Slightly prickly alcohol.  Medium-light mouthfeel, the finish starts off with that classic alcohol pop, followed by nutmeg and clove-studded oranges.  Strawberries and blueberries surge forward - then that medicinal shows up.  Slowly fades off with oak, barrel bitter, vanilla, and burnt brown sugar staying behind.

Other notes: my palate is thrashed - a little under the weather today.  That being said, this stuff is very good for the price - around $25 at a grocery store in my town.  Don't come to this expecting a totally typical rye.  The mash bill here pulls through and shows you what happens when you dial up the rye and malted barley and pull back on the corn.  A nice change of pace and a solid addition to my liquor cabinet."

2.0,"I had heard a ton of hype on this one before I tasted it blind next to 2 other 100 proof ryes. As noted by my rating, it did not live up to the hype, and was buried by Rittenhouse and EHT in a blind tasting. Even at $21, it's a hard pass for me. This was my second time tasing it:

The nose is really tight out of the bottle. Came back to it after 15 minutes and picked up ethanol and pepper at first. Second nosing of dill, feint maple, vanilla, and some floral notes. Slightly viscous and sweet on entry, with crisp apple fruit, a dry mid-palate of rye spice, grainy astringency and heat quickly take over, with a thin/weak back end of barrel char. Finish is warm, and a bit of sweetness returns, with barrel char notes, but ends abruptly. Overall, an unimpressive/indistinguishable pour."

1.5,"20 dollar budget....for a rye almost ultra budget. I don't want to write poetry about this.

Nose - It's old forester with a bit of mint, a touch of herbal/floral spice, it's honestly old forester with rye and what makes it interesting is as I understand it they used a healthy amount of barely and a lot less corn than you'd expect. Still I get a rye that remind me of old forester with well some nice rye character. 

Taste - i get more old forester with rye spices but the more I dig in the more I kinda get a the woodford malt notes which is a whisky I really enjoy for 30 bucks. They've really packed in a lot of flavor a lot of complexity....actually 50+ dollar whisky complexity into a really well priced whisky. Now don't get too excited, you get some spirit, you get some youth, and you get some off notes, but this is a 100 proof 20 dollar bottle. 

I generally find whisky at this price in the 1.0 area, very drinkable, nothing I hate, but absolutely nothing special. This is actually really enjoyable. I'm going with a 1.5 for now and I might review later as there's a part of me wanting to go 2.0, but that's where I scored Glenoyne 15 year and I don't feel that was a bad score. This isn't a 15 year old single malt, but it's way closer than any 20 dollar, clearly young, spirit should be and on that note, I'm loving what brown foreman is doing. They hit a home run on this for the price. I can't speak more highly about the value that you're getting here."

4.0,"Neat in a glencairn.  A rich ochre in the glass.  Slightly underwhelming viscosity for 100 proof.  A vibrant, yeasty, cinnamon roll dough nose with raspberry and mint edging in.  Some oak and vanilla.  A punchy heat doesn't permit a long sniff, but not rough.

Prominently spicy on the palate while sweetness only lingers afterward.  Chili pepper, oak astringency, and a gentle vanilla.  Sweet cinnamon and clove.  Oily lemon  peel.

Young and brash but quite flavorful with nothing harsh anywhere in the profile.  Absolutely loving this - a bold and rich sipper with the backbone for vibrant cocktails.  A knockout value in the low $20s and clearly differentiates itself from the more routine 51% offerings around this price point."

Nose is bright and citrusy with a hint of yeast funk from the abnormally high barley in the mashbill.

Mouth feel is decent. Spicy upfront, then sweet. Really bright notes of baking spice, lemon. Nothing at all mellowed about this but it's not offensive. Finish is good with a nice Kentucky hug."
