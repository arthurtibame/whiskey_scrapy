3.5,"Sweet nose, cinnamon heat. Compared next to Nikka Coffey grain"
3.75,"Maybe it's cos it's  no. 2 and my palate has adjusted but I quite like this one and goes against the grain of my earlier statement of disappointment in the 3.5 to 3.9 distiller rating range...there are always exceptions I guess! Nice spicy rye, caramel, black tea as Joe c noted. It's not a blow you away rye and aftertaste is slightly astringent but it's my type of rye, a solid effort and one I rate higher than the average score (which isn't a frequent occurrence). 3.75"

4.0,"Smells of jazz. Reminiscent of times gone by. Prohibition worthy rye. Notes of rebellion and yet, smooth as Duke Ellington."
4.0,"I'm not a bourbon kind of guy, much less rye, but this is enjoyable. 

There's black tea on the nose, with vanilla cream and rye. The palate has notes of tobacco, cherries, dill and charred oak. Finish is full and fairly long."

3.0,Extremely woody and almost medicinal. Smokey and almost a little peaty. The rye is definitely prominent but almost tastes like a scotch. Complex  but not one of my favorites.
2.0,"Dominant rye on the nose. The palate is smooth and very woodsy. Rye, cedar, campfire smoke are on the forefront while subtle pitted fruit and spices provides the backdrop. The finish is medium and highlights the spicy barrel notes."
4.0,"Distinct smell of rhy, caramel hints the nose. Tastes like spun sugar, caramel and has a herbal/spicy tone. Smooth aftertaste."
3.0,Meh
4.0,"Sweet on the front with plenty of lingering spice. Cinnamon, Cardamom, Caramel."

2.0,"Martzipan early on the nose, leather and grain as it opens up.  Nothing to interesting on the palette here: more grain and rye flavors"
