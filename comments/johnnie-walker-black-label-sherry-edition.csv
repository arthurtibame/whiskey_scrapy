2.0,"What a dissapointment. Black Label is usually a triumph, and was hoping this would push the blend into a Laphroaig PX direction. 

Instead it just tastes like they mixed a bit of expired sherry in with the blend. The smoke suffers as a result, and there is a bad-wine like bitterness. 

All around a shame."
3.0,"Nose is dried apricots, marmalade and vanilla. Is there a hint of smoke like normal Black label?…may be but it is very distant. The taste is round with a touch buttery malt followed by sweet fruits – Apricots and orange riding on vanilla and a touch of oak. Smoke is more present on the palate than the nose but this is not a smoky as the standard Black Label.  The finish is noticeably smoother than standard Black label – the base grain is much higher quality and in some respects this is a better scotch but is also a little less exciting as well. It’s more impressive in some respects on the rocks and I’d be happy to drink this way if I was out at a bar…I’m guessing it would be a great mixer. So an interesting new release but not earth shattering. Its score is similar to standard Black Label - 3 stars or 88."
2.5,"Nose: Lightly fruity, cereal, a faint touch of smoke and hints of oak. Nothing spectacular but OK.

Palate: A soft arrival of a largely cereal character, which develops a warm sweetness and fruity notes - orange and apricot, mainly.

Finish: Short, but soft and sweet until the very end.

This is a special edition re-engineering of the standard Black Label that, so the label says, features sherry maturation. Exactly what is going on here is a bit vague, however, as the standard JW Black also contains malts that are at least partly sherry matured. 

The label for this specifies that Blair Athol, Cardhu and Strathmill are in the recipe but as far as I know these are in the standard Black Label anyway. Standard Black Label also contains some Caol Ila, and I believe that it is present also here as well, but maybe in a reduced concentration.

So I guess it would most accurately be described as ""a blend that is a slight variation to the standard Black Label recipe featuring a couple of ring-in malts that have more sherry maturation than is the norm for Black Label"". However that's a bit long winded, so they just called it ""Sherry Edition"".

So how is it different in presentation? Well for me the nose was almost identical to the standard Black Label - maybe a little more fruit and a touch less smoke, but 95% the same. If you told me it was standard Black Label from the nose alone I'd believe you. 

The palate, however, is where things change a fair bit. Standard Black Label is very well balanced but has a tendency to be slightly ""hard"" and angular when neat - it's actually a part of its charm. The Sherry Edition, however is very soft and much more fruity, with dried figs and dates, and a velvety caramel toffee in place of the smoke. The finish is rounder and richer than regular Black Label as well.

So is it better? No - it's a variation on a theme. Everything is identifiable, but it's also different.  I'm giving it the same score as the standard Black Label and it's worth trying if you can find it on special.

""Average"" : 2.5 stars"
3.75,"Very smooth and quite different from the Black Label. I can't find much smoke, but it is much fruitier. Both fresh and dark fruits. Enjoyable neat."
