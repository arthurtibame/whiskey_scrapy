4.0,"15265, 9/2015 Batch. Very nice spice flavor, sweet with caramel and vanilla. It definitely needs to be over ice. Great price $23, so cost alone earns 4 stars."

4.0,Very smooth.
3.0,"I wanted to like this more since it's distilled in my hometown, but it has too strong of a rubbing alcohol taste. The bite is strong, but doesn't linger. There's also a sweetness in there of honey and vanilla."

4.0,I really liked this one. Big piece of ice allowed to melt made me wanting more. Brown sugar...
4.0,Much better than anticipated. Highly recommend
3.0,"Review for the Reserve Solera finish:

the nose is full of wood shavings, SK
light dusty corn, astringency, and very small hints of citrus.

the palate starts out light with a lovely powdered sugar , followed immediately by vanilla and some caramel, as well as that citrus coming back. it progresses into a vanilla cream and brown sugar, with a light splash of barrel char and oak. there is just a touch of rye spice and baking spices (cinnamon, clove). 

it finishes with vanilla, barrel char, and a huge amount of the rye character. it fades with a bit of rye spice on the back of the tongue and spread forth to the tip of the tongue, and lingers with a slight bitterness and maple-ish flavor. 

would have liked to give this 3.5 stars, but that's okay. overall, decent dram. would like to see this a tad older."

2.25,"nose: corn, sugary sweet, caramel 
palate: high corn, sweet but also grainy
finish- the rye shines..spicy finish."
3.0,Strong cinnamon finish with a little vanilla. Heavy oak taste to start with. a little water opened it up. Noticable MGP sourced high Rye bourbon. Not great but would consider it again.
3.5,nice slight spice burbon. good balance
4.25,It’s smooth.
