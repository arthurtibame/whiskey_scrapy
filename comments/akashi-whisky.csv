5.0,"I really really really liked this one. Surprisingly flavored for a blended whisky (now that i am a pretentious prick about whisky i only care about single malts), great on the nose, great on the palate, great finish and great balance. I would give it a perfect 100, but it felt not perfect but close so i gave it a 96. It can also be a 92, but it did felt like more. Bottled at 40%abv, with an amontillado sherry color. On the nose is wonderful and inviting. Caramel, brown raising cake, slight stinky peat, recent baked cake, red fruits (cherry maybe), mango peel or mango pulp, floral notes, baked red fruits, perfumed. Lovely. On the palate is also very nice, very balanced, pepper in the beggining, an orange note that comes and goes, tobacco, grass, hay, wood that might be mizunara since it is different than oak, very interesting and pleasant with a long warm, mouth watering finish. Overall i give this beauty a 96 over 100, many might not agree with me, but this was a great dram and i loved every second of it. Cheers!"
3.0,Sweet!
