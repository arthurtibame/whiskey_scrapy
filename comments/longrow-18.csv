4.5,"This review is on a bottle of Longrow 18 that I opened and have been drinking over the past two months. It was bottled 3/23/18. 

I have found this whiskey to be incredibly complex and it has changed a lot as I’ve made my way through the top half of the bottle. 

Right now, here’s what I’m getting ... 

On the nose, I smell custard, apple, cigar smoke, and fish oil. As I let it sit and open, I start getting Santa Rosa plums and sweet citrus. 

On the palate, there’s dried grass, clover honey, and eucalyptus. As it opens, I get cooked stone fruit, bread dough, seaweed and just a touch of smoldering fire.

The finish is long and lingering and leaves me wanting more.

This is one that I keep coming back to; I can’t seem to get enough. I’m giving it 4.5 for now but, if it continues on the same trajectory, I may bump it up to 4.75 or 5 by the end of the bottle."

4.25,"NOSE: You get a delicate profile of ocean spray and apple cider vinegar. It works a treat.

PALATE: Starts sweet toffee, then turns to salty toffee, then to sweet and sour ginger. The finish is salty and fruity all of a sudden.

OVERALL: In a blind tasting this initially felt flat among other 18-year olds, but by the end I found it very appealing and the one I’d most like to have again. Super balanced and interesting to explore slowly."

5.0,"Springbank motherflubbing distillery!  They keep getting better.  Because they put the extra effort to do whiskies right, I’m going to be a little extra in singing my praises.  The bottle I am enjoying now was bottled on March 23, 2018.

You cannot hurry into an aged Springbank product, least of all Longrow 18.  You pour it, and let it air for 15 minutes.  This is an expensive bottle, so you don’t want to rush the experience.  First, marvel at the bottle.  Scotch has become about this prestige thing – feigned luxury and exclusivity; fancy clothes for fancy bottles; in these sordid whisky fests in the U.S., where your outfit better be more expensive than the expensive entry fee.  Springbank is the plain-clothed marvel; white T-shirt and jeans, in a room full of Tom Ford suits and dresses.  It’s all about what is inside.  Confidence and character.

The nose.  THE NOSE!  Pickled mangoes.  Tangerines.  Creamy and thick for something that’s only 46% ABV.  The peat is floral and meaty at the same time, like flowers that have just started to wilt.  Or that meat flower… whatchamacallit?  I’m no botanist.  Anways… a fragrant saltiness.  Rather than the cool rocky coasts of Scotland, the nose takes you to a tropical island.  But one where things are starting to pickle.  It’s characteristic of a good Springbank, and this one nails it.

Longrow 18 is not something most people will automatically like.  It is what some reviewers would call challenging.  It does not have the universal superficial appeal of a calendar model, a Prince Charming, a Princess Fiona before she turns into an ogress.  Longrow 18 is Shrek.  Good whiskies are like onions.  They have layers.  Missed the reference?  Watch the movie (the original).  You will not turn into a dapper young buck holding a dram of Longrow 18 in your hand, like if you hand an old mahogany Macallan.  You may turn into an ogre, or ogress, or Ralphy.  And you will be beautiful, like Ralphy.  That dude – you can be him for Hallowe’en… not a bad idea for a whisky tasting theme actually.

The palate.  Soft, mouthcoating arrival that takes time to unravel.  Tobacco, overripe starfruit, a little honey, a little citrus.  Medium spice with a lot of complexity.  White pepper.  A little cinnamon, nutmeg, and fennel seed.  And then there’s weird flavors that somehow add to the balance; the beauty of the thing.  A taste like a wet sock smells, like one you’ve worn for an hour after stepping into a puddle.  A seaweed umaminess… see?  An onion has layers.

Longrow 18 epitomizes the distillery that refuses to change.  It does nothing to try to reach into new markets; to change its flavors to appeal to the common trepid consumer who likes to stay at the fringes of every adventure.  This whisky will never come to you, if you are standing way over there, in the Pappy van Winkle line, like a baroque cow.  You must come to it.

The finish.  Long, mercurial, chimeric.  A peat that walks the line between a tobacco smoke and a meaty smoke.  A slight matchstick Sulphur – that’s not just okay; that’s quite lovely.  A potpourri of fruit jams.  Some roasted nuts.  It’s well rounded, and evolving.  And the next sip will be something different.  Like the truly great whiskies, this one changes for the better with time in the bottle, and also with time in the glass.

So, what is the best distillery?  Some people are offended by the question.  Some have the patience to rationalize a political answer.  “It’s all subjective, and depending on your taste.  It’s like I might say that Brussel sprouts are the best vegetable, while you can just as assuredly say spinach.  There is no single right answer.”  But there is, so just stop.  It’s Springbank.

Mark: 96/100"

5.0,"Nose: At first encounter the nose seemed to be more like a Springbank than than a Longrow. There was a little vanilla, malted barley, a soft briny maritime note, some leather armchair but only a faint sooty smoke. There was also a definite earthy aroma from the dunnage and some woody hints like old cigar boxes. Over time the aromas evolved and melded together and light honey and dried fruit aromas (apples, pears, prunes) appeared. A deep, enveloping, oaky smokiness gradually emerged to eventually present what is probably the most elegant and sophisticated smoky nose I’ve experienced. A calm, soft, huge and fragrant smoke that makes anything issuing from the Hebridean islands seem brash and callow.
    
    Palate: A soft and slightly briny arrival, which became saltier and quite spicy in the development. Ginger, but not fresh ginger - more like powdered ginger. Very lightly oily, but not mouth-coating, and also slightly dry. Light fruity notes, but again not fresh juicy fruit - older, like dried fruits soaked in water to reconstitute for cooking. Once again over time the palate opened and gained considerable polish, eventually becoming broad, rich and mellow. The whisky seemed to just float into the mouth and gradually inhabit the whole head, becoming the focus of all one’s attention.
    
    Finish: Medium, ginger spicy - even peppery. A little sour salt and a hint of smoke or ash at the fade-out with just the perfect amount of sweetness to balance the briny and sour notes.
    
    This review compiles notes from many tastes of batches over the last decade and is a summary of my final impressions. This whisky is both subtle and tightly wrapped and it requires a couple of weeks to wake up after initial opening, and 20 minutes rest in the glass with a couple of drops of water is strongly recommended.
    
The first time I tasted it I was not that impressed with Longrow 18, but it was my palate that was lacking - not the whisky. Over time I came to fall in love with its charms and appreciate its blossoming as it opens up from its long slumber in the bottle.  I consider it, and particularly the most recent batches, to be just a hair's breadth away from faultless. It is characterful, satisfying, mellow and smooth with endless layering and depths as great as the sounding seas. Truly a top shelf dram.
    
There have been three changes to the label over the years: The first, from 2008-2010 was a blueish purple label. The second, from 2011-3013, was a yellow-beige label, and the current batches have a white label with a prominent “18” in purple. There are slight batch variations but they are subtle changes of profile and not big differences in quality. That said, for me the current releases are the best it has ever been.
    
“A bat's squeak away from perfect” : 5 stars"
5.0,"Light peat smoke, old furniture oak and clementine rind on the nose. Warm and oily mouthful. Orange, candied fruit, and slight herbal note (chamomille) on the palate. Light oak spice and ash on fairly long finish. Yet another great expression from J. & A. Mitchell and beautiful representation of the Campbeltown whisky region. Love it."
4.0,"Nice, balanced, and smokier than it is peated, though I wouldn't describe it as smoky either - considering how partial I am to anything coming out of Springbank, I'm actually glad I blind-tasted this whisky. I would have perhaps overhyped it in my head. The nose is a tad underwhelming, with hints of smoke and pear (maybe mandarins as well); it's actually much more pleasant than it sounds. The palate is medium-bodied and oily, with a touch of nutmeg and mineral (pleasant spices). As for the finish, it was alright. All in all good scotch, but not more than that."
3.0,"Really surprised by this whisky. Longrow is pitched as the peaty oily cousin of the springbank family and up against the Springbank Burgundy, 18, Green and Halzelburn 12 amongst others I tasted on the night it didnt really shine. Very light and subtle. I still did like it but def wouldn't buy a bottle especially for the price. I see from other reviews on line some people have also had the same experience i.e. a completely different flavour profile and style from what is promoted. There seems to be large batch variance year to year"

4.75,"To paraphrase Vesper Lynd from Casino Royale: There are whiskies and there are whiskies, this is the latter. But more on that in a minute. Before this I’d never had a Longrow, and my experience with Springbank as a whole has been, sadly, limited to a precious few expressions. So when I came across this 2018 bottling of Longrow 18 year old at auction I just couldn’t resist. For the low low price of $110 (plus a 10% buyers fee, 3% insurance fee and a hefty shipping charge) the bottle was mine. I was deciding which bottle to open for my next Dapper Drams review and fate lead me here. This 18 year old single malt from Campbeltown is bottled at 46% ABV and is non chill filtered and natural color of an amber bronze. The maturation come from 60% refill sherry butts and 40% fresh bourbon barrels. Less than 100 casks per year are filled for the Longrow line, so this is a limited annual release. 

Right away the nose let’s you know that this is a different kind of single malt. Elegant, mature peat balanced with sherry, a savory meatiness, lemon and orange citrus/oil. They say let a whisky rest 1 minute in the glass for every year in the cask before approaching it. This one needs about 50% more to shine. Once it rests you will get old oak worn smooth, apples, plums, dark cherries and dates. Sweet molasses BBQ sauce, leather, pipe tobacco and creamy vanilla. Lightly salty, ginger, sulfur/spent matches and a light chalky/mineral note. Toasted marshmallows, dark chocolate with cayenne powder (but not hot), chili powder and chocolate licorice. Herbal at times with basil, oregano and mint. Hot fudge, caramel and toffee with a hint of strawberries and black licorice. 

The palate arrives with some peppery spice up front, followed by luxurious peat smoke and dark sherry. Molasses, walnuts, chocolate sauce, hazelnut and milk chocolate. Ginger, old polished oak, tobacco, leather. Caramel, caramelized peaches, juicy raisins, dates and figs. Meaty, sulfuric, slightly tannic and bitter but as a positive note. Chili spice, Worcestershire sauce, basil. Cigar ashes, lapsang souchong tea with honey and vanilla. 

A medium to full bodied mouthfeel that is oily, thick but silky, mouthwatering and fabulous. 
The finish is medium to medium long at times with peat, chocolate, molasses, sulfur, black tea and orange oil. 

This scotch is a game changer...quite possibly the most balanced whisky I’ve ever had. The nose is a bit closed off at first, but given enough time it opens up to reveal a beautiful array of aromas. I could seriously nose this for hours without taking the first sip, and find something new every time I went back to it. The palate is luxurious but also packs a bit of a punch. A bit of everything here. After over 350 whiskies under my belt this has to be the best total package bottle to date. My only complaint, if you could really call it that, would be that the finish isn’t long enough. I’ve had some that you drink at 9pm and still taste after you wake up in the morning. This kind of dies abruptly from time to time just as things seem like they are going to continue on. Still, if I could only drink this for the rest of my life I don’t think I would mind at all. 4.75 and I highly recommended that if you see it, just buy it no questions asked. 
Cheers"

4.0,Very salty and fruity and floral Amazing dram
3.75,"2014 edition, bottled early July. This is in the new white boxes or as I like to the call them ""should I just throw the box away?"" edition. 

Nose - This reminds me at first of a really sweet red wine. Almost a wine with sugar in it. Then I start to pick out some of the salty notes from the peat. There's a bit of a baked good in here as well. Almost red wine, soy sauce and maybe a baked cookie. then there's a light gently toasted oak note at the end.

Taste - Not very sweet up front. Soft and gentle. As it goes to the back of the tongue you get savory salts and then the whole things just goes bonkers with sherry and BBQ and oak tannin and there's even a bitterness here to go with the savory and the sweet and salty. Super complex.

So I just did a 2010-2012 range bottle before this 2014. The older bottle was sweeter and had the better nose. The 2014 here however has more going on in the finish and brings in more intense extremes in the bitter, salty, heck there might even be a slight sour note. 

I think I like the 2014 more but I'm still going with a 3.75. I think longrow 18 in both cases is just missing something for me to push it into the higher scores. Sure 50% would get it there but there's more to it. There's just something missing here.

I'll have to eventually get around to buying a few of the newer bottling, I think I had an 18 recently with some friends, but that was a dizzying day of drinking the best of the best."
3.75,"I swear, it's getting hard to remember what I have and haven't reviewed from my bottles. I haven't reviewed a longrow 18 yet? 

Lets first review the old purple box version. I'm guessing this was 2010-2012 bottling range. No date to be found on this one. And for anyone interested I do have a bit of cork floating in the bottle and I had to replace the original cork (and I just broke the new cork so this bottle is on to its 3rd cork...screw caps people!). These are going for about 200 these days, but my store literally dropped the price from 240 to 200 the day after I bought this bottle, the last of the old boxes. Oh well

Nose - I get sherry and grape bubble gum on the nose. Rich wine and citrus and hints of sea salt. As i explore I start to get BBQ over salty pork ribs. 

Taste - So this is a really hard whisky to explain, perhaps why i haven't reviewed it yet. It's sweet, it's light, it's subtle up front. If the Longrow Red's are in your face expressions of finishing and high abv the longrow 18 is a prim and proper dram, worthy of a statesman. There's peat, there's sherry, but it's all muted and refined up front. It then explodes on the finish where everything from vinegar, red wines, salted meats, sugar cookies, oak, and this classic longrow funk remain. It's almost too subtle and muted at first taste, but there's a sleeping giant behind it. 

This is a bit under whelming for me, and I plan to review a newer bottling next to compare. Still the complexity is there, the nose is one worthy of hours of time, and the flavors are great.

3.75 - I cannot give this one a 4, it's a bit too light up front for me, but it's one hell of a whisky."

4.5,"(This regards the 2019 edition)
The nose is unexpectedly caressing, of vanilla, ripe cherry, plum and white chocolate, with the peat that collects and incorporates the aromas in its fleshy and medicinal heart. Tobacco. Very balanced and elegant.
The mouth is oily and ashy, with a very pleasant vinous dryness. The dance between peat and fruity notes continues graceful, with notes of Caribbean cigar, plums, black cherries, yellow peach, vanilla, a slight herbaceous hint on the background, a touch of dried fruit. Full-bodied, with hints that alternate and mingle with each sip, where peat knows how to be the protagonist without gigionizing, in a very enjoyable overall chorus.
The finish is rather long, ashy and dry with plums and almonds.
An example of great balance and wisdom, with a peat that you expected to explode and instead knows how to integrate masterfully with the aromas of the aging casks. Elegant and sober as you don't expect."

5.0,"This review is for a bottle from 2018

I gave this bottle 96 out of 100 back when I was giving scores out of 100.  Now that the bottle is finished, I give it 3 stars, which is my highest rating, and the only other whisky to get it is Balblair 1990.  There’s nothing much to add to my previous review.  Now that the bottle is finished, it feels like I’ve lost a best friend.

This gem is simply the best standard release bottling from any Scottish distillery; matured 18 years exclusively in delicious casks.  Seriously, when a bottle is this good, you really don’t care about investigating its pedigree.  I was a little superfluous with the notes in my previous review, so I’ll keep it simple here: on the nose, spectacular; on the palate, spectacular; and the finish is… spectacular.  $200+ is a little pricey for an 18 year old, but if pricing were based solely on quality, this would be worth twice that.

Score: *** (I am not worthy)
How much does a bottle cost: $190-220
How much do I think a bottle is worth: $450"
4.0,"Complex and unusual well aged whiskey

Nose: strong Peat,, sweet, Fruity, toffee, nice and complex, very appealing
Taste strong At first, then cooked fruits, Toffee, small campfire/charcoal, vanilla, slightly minty…
Finish medium long dominated by Peat

Everyone seems to have a different reaction to this unusual whiskey. In part, I attribute this to the unusual mix of flavors, but also to the shifting palate. Certainly, it is difficult to describe, and is also changing and different every time I Taste it. 
Desirable, but the price is relatively high
Some time in the glass does help
