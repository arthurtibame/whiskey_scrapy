2.0,Very cereal forward. Not for me.

4.0,"[12.15.2019] I've been drinking the for a few weeks but haven't had the time to post it. Bought it in the Windy City on a work trip 4 years back for a friend whose wife promptly put a retroactive hiatus on his habit. Kept waiting for a change but gave up after a bad week at work. 

Sweet, malty, smooth and easy at 93 proof (surprised me and I had to go back to the bottle!), this would be a go-to if it weren't for the price. As it stands, this is a mild mannered, palette pleaser overpriced in a market saturated with novelties. Best this about it is the uncut flavor and proof, complete with a malty taste u bastardized with synthetic smoke. If you need a bottle to complete a decorative set, pay me the shipping and I'll send it empty."

null,The aroma definitely stands out.  It is strong like some funky French cheese and actually is quite enjoyable to drink.
