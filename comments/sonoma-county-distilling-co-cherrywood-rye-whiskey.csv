4.0,"Definitely a unique experience. As stated in the tasting notes, it doesn't seem as young as it is. I'd prefer it to be on the younger side, as the cherrywood would likely be too dominate if they let it age longer. All in all, an enjoyable/unique change of pace. I wasn't overly excited about the nose, but it grew on me as I worked my way through the glass."

5.0,"I love this stuff. From nose to finish, it's so different. There is a solid amount of flavour and complexity.  Cherrywood smoked barley is amazing, the rye brings a good amount of spice and flavour to the party. The blend of grains create a really balanced taste. It's slightly astringent, but that doesn't take away from it at all. 
This bottle is one of my top 3 favourites."
4.0,Tastes of cherry are surely there but IMO it detracts from the whiskey
