5.0,One shot in Glencairn glass.  Rested for ~ 30 minutes.   Nose is butterscotch cherries oak.   Taste of creamy butter veiled cherry soft tobacco.  Medium finish - not hot at all.  May benefit from water tho I rarely dilute so ymmv.  If you can find it ....

4.25,"On the nose I get caramel & baking spices, chocolate, roasted nuts, little smoke and in the back of there some fruit.  For me, I took a dab of this and rubbed it under my nose to dry a little, then stepped outside to get a fresh smell outside of the house.  There it was, nice hints of what I think is apricot or peach notes, almost cobbler like, very nice.  The body was medium, not too thin, but not really super deep and robust or chewy.  The finish was great, the bourbon left great smells of fruits, caramels , warm baking spices & almost chocolate hinting cigar notes in my glass.  I ended up smelling the empty glass for a good 20 min after.  This is really good and will possibly be even better after a few months of decanting."

5.0,Absolutely amazing. Hard to describe and it's too bad they don't make it more available.
5.0,I recently got to try a pour of this in Nashville with a really good friend of mine. In the top two bourbons I have tried. Thick and syrupy rich. I love this bourbon. Seems to almost have a maraschino cherry taste in there some where.

5.0,"This was the closing pour after hearty Thanksgiving meal this evening, courtesy of my cousin.  Ever take a long road trip vacation, through boring countryside that has nothing but grass fields and farm houses, only to end up hours later at a beautiful countryside resort facing gorgeous vistas ?  The road trip was then so worth it.  This is like that road trip.  On first arrival after opening the bottle, it’s a bit too oaky, almost making you think those 12 years in cask must’ve been way too taxing.  But, let it sit out for an hour, through your post-dinner conversation.  You’re then treated to amazing flavors of caramel, Tabacco, leather.  Really well integrated.  If you come across this, open and share with family / friends.  It’s almost a sin to keep this on the shelf."

3.75,"Tasted this 2 ways: 
- Full Proof straight out of the bottle
- Lower Proof with a few drops of H20

...Full Proof...
On the nose: Sweet Cherry, almond, and vanilla - almost like an alcoholic cherry cordial candy. Alcohol comes through at 110 proof but isn’t overwhelming.

First taste: Charred oak, alcohol and deep complexities that hit you VERY fast. Bitter chocolate, deep cherry, thick slice and smoke come along once the alcohol has burned off a bit. 

Finish: Wow...this just lingers in your mouth and finishes incredibly complex. Like an earl grey tea with honey and smoke...maybe even a little lemon. Cherry and malt round things out.


...A few drops of water...
On the nose: More almond, vanilla and sweet oak. Less cherry.

Taste: Beautifully opens up at a lower  Proof and the flavors unfold slower. Baking spices, cherry, toasted oak, bread, and sweet malt.

Finish: Still amazed at how long this lingers. At a lower Proof, it definitely finishes sweeter and more on the toasty malt side with a deep cherry coating of your entire mouth."

3.75,"Look:  Nice amber color, alcohol legs, lacing the whole shabang 

Nose:  bananas, before I even get into the glass, I get bananas. Then a perfumey rye but also slightly rubbing alcohol. At one point it smelled like original old spice.  Some more sweetness with swirling. The alcohol smell gives more of a fruit and nut combo.  

Palate:  what a strange initial flavor, I’m not even sure what that is. Like a mix of banana nuts and dark fruits. As the whiskey sits on the tongue I get more if that perfume rye like flavors popping up and some oak.  Then some more banana.

Finish:  Banana flavors with oak, medium bitterness and lingering flavor.  Slight heat, nothing crazy.  

Overall:  I can’t say I’m crazy over this whiskey, definitely more unique with the fruity aspects I’m getting and some nuttiness, but it just doesn’t sit right with me.  
With water:  a little more spice on the nose with the bananas and alcohol dissipating, slight maple (maybe the power of suggestion). Palate is similar but less potent, the bitterness and alcohol presence gets sanded down giving that maple flavor.  Worth trying, probably not a bottle purchase for the price it commands though."
4.75,"Nose: incredibly complex with strong almost floral vanilla leading the pack and other sweets like cotton candy, Carmel, and cherry

Palate: silky smooth and sweet with butterscotch and peach with a hint of strawberry

Finish: long and light almost floral fruit with just a small hint of heat and tartness"

3.25,It’s good. Not great. I tasted in a blind and ranked it 5 out of 6. Get light fruit notes on the nose. It has a light mouth feel. Drinks easy. The finish is where this one shines. Lasts a long time for this proof of bourbon. Initial apricot with back end spice. Not sure this one is worth the price or hype.

4.75,bright fruit. citrus. balanced. minimal heat. dries the tongue on the finish. well done Jackie!
4.0,"Note: apricot, very fruity from far away, vanilla, orange, magic marker(?), almond, cherry and oak

Body: thin, light, easy

Palate: light on spice and oranges

Finish: delayed warmth and interesting but not complex. 

Note: I really wanted to love this one but in the end it was easy to drink and simple. I do very much like it but perhaps not robust enough or distinctive enough to get into the love it collection. But I would buy this."

4.25,The opening nose is the best OF has produced of late with sweet cherries. The mid palate is fantastic with the faintest hint of banana and the mouth feel is where the money is made. A very buttery coating of the mouth. The finish lingers long with tasty stone fruits. Absolute winner with the higher proof this year.!

Palate- Berries, sweet cherries tossed in sugar, salted caramel, vanilla, oak, brown sugar, spice, lemon

Finish- long and creamy mouthfeel with notes of spice and mouthwatering cherry cobbler

Absolutely lovely. Incredibly complex, delicious flavors and one of the greatest noses on a bourbon i’ve ever had. Every time I drink it I find new flavors and complexity. Cherry cobbler best describes the nose and palate on this one. Absolutely worth it for MSRP. One of the rarer whiskies that may even be worth secondary as well."
