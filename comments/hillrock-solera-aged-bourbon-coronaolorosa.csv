4.0,"This is a private pick by Rochester Elite Barrel Pickers and is finished in oloroso casks. The color is a deep and vibrant amber that leaves strong legs all over the sides of the glass. 

The nose immediately gives off sweet sherry with bourbon notes of oak, vanilla, brown sugar, baking spices and touches of pepper. 

The sweetness from the sherry is evident right away which is followed by a wave of spice including cinnamon, pepper and rye. Dry oak and anise comes out along with faint hint of vanilla creaminess. 

The finish is medium with lingering sherry and spice that fades nicely to oaky undertones."
