4.0,A little bit smoky but sherry influence is really huge. Nice dram with long aftertaste.
4.5,Amazing whisky! Great long lingering taste and very nice on the palate and nose.
4.75,"Just like Mel Gibson in the movie (you know the one) this dram liberates the pallet and brings it to a new level. Fantastic dram. Its ABV and cherry is wonderful. Hopefully, the ABV hits you better than it hit Mel Gibson."
3.25,Well its now 4 months after being open and well bellow a kneck pour and its one of the most dissapointing whiskies I ever purchased with all the hype and high scores. Lots of alchohol burn of a very young whisky and unimpressive taste profile. With all the great scores possibly there is a large variance of quality with Kilkerran. I have the 12 year as well and not very impressed . No more Kilkerran for me..........no thanks!

3.5,"Well a little disappointing so far. My bottle has now been opened for 10 weeks now, 1 inch below neck pour, and tasting again as I write this review. Nice sherry nose  but a bit harsh alcohol burn with some funky flavors. Altogether my feeling  = Just OK!   I'll check in another month to see if things have toned down and mellowed out from oxidation."

4.5,"Complex and funky. On nose: beautiful, complex. Very strong sherry notes, rubbery, plum, warming spices, hint of smoke. Caramel(?) swetness. All in perfect harmony. Despite the high ABV no any alcohol. Palate: for me too alcohol intensive without water, even after several sips. With some water, banana, dark fruits, creamy and warming spices with some funky note and subtle dryness during the finish. Very interesting dram."
