4.0,"Nose: butter, green apples, fig newtons, bar nuts. 

Palate: starts smooth with a buttery sweetness followed by a bit of fire. More of the green apple, with a bit of blue cheese.

Finish: medium, smooth smoke, snow, wood."

3.5,"Nose: not as strong of a pear as Yamazaki 12 year. More citrusy and spice. 
Palate: very mellow flavor. Not super fruity but well-balanced. 
Finish: super creamy like the whipped cream on top of a Starbucks Frappuccino. 

I think I like Yamazaki better as of right now"
3.25,"Another lost whisky thanks to demand out pacing production.  

Nose - Honey, pear, apples, and a bit of spice (box is saying pine needles...not sure about that one).  A deeper nosing brings out a bit of smoke oh and yeah a bit of a savory note.  It's really interesting a gentle nosing is all fruity and citrus and then you dig in and you find some real meat.  

Taste - so we open with citrus, more pears from the nose, some spicy notes, perhaps some mint, money, a touch of oak, oh vanilla for sure, and just a tiny hint of smoke, a dash of salted meat.  All the savory and meat and smoke notes are extremely subtle and can easily be missed.  Perhaps not mint but menthol.  

100 bucks and absolutely worth it for me.  I think I like this more than the Yam 12, a lot more."
4.5,"Japanese whiskies are strange to me.  Age statement releases are rare and expensive.  The NAS releases that have replaced them are just trash, and there is nothing in between.  At one point, I had both a Yamazaki 12 and a Hakushu 12 bottle open.  The Yamazaki is easier to approach, and has more mass appeal; it has completely disappeared off the shelves except at prices around $200.  The Hakushu 12 is ultimately more complex, arguably better, and if you go treasure hunting at ghetto liquor stores in Maryland, you can still occasionally see bottles in the $80-100 range.  At the fancier stores, they are also $200, if they have them at all.

These aged Japanese whiskies are simply better than Scotch.  In the last blind tasting I tried with the Hakushu 12, it went up against a Kilkerren 12, Glen Grant 18, and a Gordon MacPhail Mortlach 25.  The Hakushu won, and the only whisky that came close was the Mortlach, a $250 bottle.  On the nose, the Japanese whisky felt like a whole dimension ahead of its Scottish competition; like comparing being in a forest with a picture of a forest.

I do not believe in terroir, but I’ll be damned if I didn’t start to think about fresh green forests when nosing Hakushu 12.  This whisky is clean and crisp, but also bold.  It greets your nose with a floral, sweet embrace and takes you on a complex journey of scents.  You do not have to search around; the aromas reach out and grab you.  The palate is weaker, but still delightful.  Peat smoke has never been this well integrated.  A floral, heathery peat is definitely present if you know to expect it; but someone who hates peat will drink this and never know that it is peated.  Maybe a Rosebank has a similar style, but these are way harder to come by, and more expensive.  So, complain as we might about the prices for these Japanese whiskies, but you really can’t get a better whisky with a similar style for cheaper.

Score: ** (unimaginably good)
How much does a bottle cost: $80-200
How much do I think a bottle is worth: $200"

Yuzu citrus on the nose and sweetened on the palate. Nice short and sharp peppery peat finish."

4.5,"Really cool flavor. Grassy, earthy, lightly smoky, and delicate. Don’t know of a Scotch that’s comparable. Can’t wait for this to be not-impossible to find eventually."

4.5,"Nose- Grass, grapefruit, peat smoke, Japanese pear, honey, fresh herbs

Palate- Pears, honey, peat smoke, earthy, sweet oranges, milk chocolate, sea salt

Finish- Medium, oily finish with notes of grass, chocolate and a light wisp of smoke

Great whisky. Excellent balance of earth and sweetness. Love the grass and fresh fruit notes that I get throughout the entire whisky. Notes of grapefruit and pears on the nose and palate also add the the balance and complexity. Finish could be longer, but is enjoyable nonetheless. Not sure I would buy a bottle of this, but would absolutely order this at a bar for a fair price."

4.25,"What I would give to go back in time and stock up on this. Lovely Japanese finesse mixed with a woodsy and smooth smoke and just a hint of lingering peat. Makes most of the heated scotches feel flat footed and slow. For a 12 year, it was well refined and I sadly miss having bought only one."

4.25,"Neat in a glencairn.  Aired for a half-hour.  A very crisp and clear golden hue in the glass.  Thin body.  Legs don't seem to match the relatively watery consistency: extremely slow to form, and oily-thick when they do.

An immediate but subtle waft of peat, however most of the aroma is clean and richly aromatic.  Green apple and pine bark.  Damp forest.  Touches of caramel and honey.  Morphs into spiced pear on a whim, and right back again.  Beautiful, without a trace of an ethanol kick.

The palate is bursting with more green apple - rich and sweet, before the iodine and peat gracefully assert themselves.  The sherry influence is also elegantly done - evident but stays on side stage for the most part.  The palate manages to balance many components without evidence of the blending... the sum greater than the parts.  A pleasant and almost minty spice lingers on the edges of the tongue and roof of the mouth for a respectable finish at 43%.  The sweet peat and menthol combine to a bit of a saccharine note that isn't my thing, but also not unpleasant.

Really enjoy this dram.  Fairly expensive at today's pricing, but offers a little something unique and is a great addition to the shelf."
4.25,Superb!  Loved it.  Incredibly smooth with a great bite and finish that all good Whisky should have. Sometimes smoothness drowns out the myriad of flavours and journey of tastes. Not here.
