2.25,"Good for the money if you mix it, rather caustic otherwise. A lot of vanilla."
2.5,I've seen a lot of people positively review this but it tastes like barely aged corn liquor with a cloying over sweetness I'd rate it a 1.5 if not for the value. The nose is deceptive with a spicy oak smell to it but it doesn't transfer over into the taste at all and all I got was a fairly raw overwhelmingly corn liquor or moonshine taste. Still though I'm rating at 2.5 stars only because at this price point it would make an excellent mixing or introductory Bourbon. Those with very new or unrefined palates for whiskey or those who mix only could enjoy this because the low spice and overwhelming sweetness and it would make a pretty good entry whiskey. If I drank my whiskey anything but neat with the occasional water splash I'd probably rate this higher as again it mixes well.

2.25,"Not the worst daily sipper if your want something cheap. Better than Jim Beam in my opinion.  Standard bourbon notes of caramel, vanilla, and brown sugar with a little spice on the finish. I always have some in my bar."
4.25,"Nose... Apples, raisins, pears, and a slight citrus scent, gives way to a light woodsy profile...

Appearance... A medium to dark amber...

Taste... A heavy dose of fresh wood and leather came directly to the forefront upon the initial sip. From there I picked up notes of cut grass, pepper, vanilla and honey...

Overall... Although the price point is so so low, which can lead to a bit of skepticism, this bourbon truly packs a ton of nuance and flavors. I really find myself reaching to pour another neat glass which I do with ease since the price is so darn easy on the wallet... I'll be buying more for nights when I need that extra glass to get to where I need to be... Excellent value..."

1.0,Tastes extremely young and almost artificial in sweetness. Almost likes it is trying to be sweet rather than just being what it is. Maybe it's ok to mix with coke but...that's even a stretch. I'd rather smash a couple Natty Daddys than drink this.

The taste is soft up front and takes a bit to come on. Reminds me of flat - maybe even watered down - coca cola. Fruity and rooty, but not overtly so. Finish is short with mild burn.

Easy to drink but ultimately limited in what it is and has to offer. Still, not a bad budget bourbon."

2.0,"I have a backlog of holiday tastings that I'm trying to get through before the Summer lineup. The following is a simple ""just for the hell of it"" type of review, to give a quick impression of something that I happened to taste because it was in front of me, but I will probably never bother trying again:

The nose has coffee with vanilla creamer. Light and grassy, a little rye spice in the middle, but not much distinctive flavor. Short finish. It didn't make me want to spit it out. Knoxville station 94Z (94.3)

That last thing was a really good alt-rock radio station that I discovered out of nowhere, while traveling through Eastern Tennessee. I jotted it down at the end of the text message draft containing this brief tasting note as a reminder, to avoid wasting a message sent to myself. It added half a star to the score. That's how forgettable this bourbon is."

null,"Nose: Cherry Airheads, sweet corn mash, honeyed granola, and some slight ethanol pops through. Simple, inviting, and sweet.

Palate: Honey sweetness loads up the initial palate, but the cherry notes climb and climb in the mid-palate. Sweet corn and barrel bitterness pushes in the back. Thin to medium viscosity.

Finish: Some bitterness sticks to the finish, but mainly this finishes grain-forward and without much sustain. Sitting at 86 proof, however, allows you to feel some heat and get some barrel spices along the way. 

I would recommend this as a casual mixer that would give you a nice punch of proof compared to your standard 80 proofers out there. For the price, this gives you some character."
3.25,"Such balance for such value. 

Nose- noticeable but light, equally present notes of char, caramel & vanilla
Palate- slick viscosity & sweet notes of light brown sugar, caramel and very light spice
Finish- quickly dissipates but does not disappoint.

The taste is pleasant albeit virtually anonymous, and it goes down as smooth as a Vanilla Fribble. If character or taste are not exceptionally important, this is a perfectly decent late afternoon bourbon, offering some inoffensive conversation before your real friends arrive. Let's put it this way: I had it in an airport lounge -- it was the free-pour bourbon on the counter -- and it's pretty good for an airport lounge. So let's call it what it is: A good airport lounge bourbon."

Taste is mild but bland with heavy straw notes and some pepper on the back end. I can't think of much use for this one, unless there's a cocktail where all you want to come through is straw and not much bourbon flavor. It wasn't unpleasant really, I just couldn't find a reason to finish a pour. The splash of ginger beer I added out if curiosity drowned out everything but a hint of straw... moving on."

Nose: An initial muddled sweetness emerges from my Glencairn. Vanilla, Caramel, and Barrel Char. But, give it 10 minutes or so in the glass and you are rewarded with a Dry Grassiness similar to the smell of Hay being stored in an Old Barn. Maybe just a hint of citrus peel as well.
Neat: Thinnish mouthfeel, but not overly so. Dried Corn, Oak Char, Dry Roast Peanuts which combine with a little Vanilla and Char to create a Peanut Brittle sweetness. Mild Kentucky Hug on a quickly fading finish with Oak and a little of that Peanut Brittle coating the palate. 
Splash: Water makes the nose and palate all Dried Corn.
Verdict: I like it. No ""Soapy"" note like I got from my last bottle. Serviceable neat and mixes well. Goes for $13, which is $4 cheaper than Beam's standard White Label despite being 6 Proof Points higher. My advice? Chip in the extra couple dollars and get the EW BIB or the EW 1783, both of which are much better. But for a $13 available everywhere Straight Bourbon Whiskey, this one is hard to beat."

2.75,"This review of Evan Williams Black Label is a simple head-to-head tasting against Jim Beam Original (White Label) - two bottom shelf, entry level, budget bourbons that can be found pretty much anywhere. 

There's a bar not far from where I work that does a rotating happy hour special for people having bad days - for $6, you get to pick your combination of poison: a beer + a shot.  The last time I was there, you got to choose between a can of Modelo + a shot of Jose Cuervo, or a can of PBR + a shot of EW Black Label.  Now, if I really wanted to recreate what the bar was going for, I would have pitted this EW Black Label up against some Jose Cuervo, but they rotate the bottles and cans of poison every now and so in theory, Jim Beam could be up against EW Black some day.  So it got me thinking - which would win out between the two?   (And let's be honest - I've tasted some terrible whiskies in my time, and yet I don't think any of them have come close to the appallingly repulsive dumpster fire that is Jose Cuervo ""Especial"".  I'm staying away so I don't feel horrifically ""especial"" afterwards.)  Enough tangential backstory, let's see what this budget bourbon has to offer.  

Mash Bill: 78% Corn, 12% Malted Barley, 10% Rye
Age: NAS (at least 4 years and thought to be between 4-7 years)
ABV: 43%
Price: $9.99 (typically $10-$17)

Nose: Still fairly weak like the Jim Beam Original, but this is a bit brighter and more lively.  Fresh, dark caramel and corn with vanilla. Rye spice, anise, and barrel char.  Artificial cherry candies.  

Palate: Fairly thin, with dark caramel and sweet corn mirrored from the nose.  More vanilla, anise, and rye spice, with woody astringency.  A bit more richness and oiliness by comparison to the Jim Beam Original.  

Finish: Short and thin.  Watery sweetness and oak dominates.  

Verdict: Well, this is about as brawny as a prepubescent.  And while it's not a total game changer, the extra 3% ABV really makes a difference and helps this stand out from the Jim Beam.  I picked the PBR + EW Black combo that night and split it with a buddy - now I know I'd do the same again if Jim Beam showed up on the list of choices next time.  I'm giving this 0.25 and a point over the Jim Beam Original.

3.0,"It’s been a while since I’ve had this, and never from an analytical standpoint. Let’s check out this classic (cheap) bourbon.

The nose is sweet with honey, vanilla, light baking spices and rye spice, light fruit (pears), there’s a slight grassyness, light almond nuttyness and some youthful corn. Very Heaven Hill.

The palate is sweet and light with vanilla, very light spices, and just a smidge of oak.

The finish has a nice little burn at the top of the throat and tip of the tongue with lingering vanilla sweetness and a slight bitterness at the very end.

Since this one is only 86 proof, I had to search a little harder to pick out the flavors. But overall, not bad.

I tried this against their White Label (Bottled In Bond), yes the proof is a little higher and has fuller flavors, but the rye spice is way more pronounced on the White Label, not sure how that’s possible given it’s the same mashbill."

1.0,Corny/caramel/cherry. Very light flavor. Lots of bite.
3.0,"Apple, heat, burn"
3.0,"I know what you are thinking; A 3 rating for a bottom shelf bourbon? Please, hear me out. This bourbon is punching far above it's weight. I just finished my Four Roses Small Batch and I've been working on my Willett Copper Pot and it hit me. I'm spending a hell of a lot on bourbon! So I searched online for a quality budget drink. This came up again and again.

Everything I have read appears to be spot on. There is a definitely a heavy sweet aroma - like corn syrup and vanilla frosting.  The palate is caramel corn and candied fruits with that vanilla still in the background.  The mouth feel is thick, a bit buttery if not outright oily. There is a cool, almost mint like finish. Give a minute or two and there is a slight warming in the throat and belly, but there is no harshness.

That would be my biggest complaint about this bourbon. The only thing I would like for t to have is a higher proof. I think it would take care of the oily mouth feel and the minty finish. It needs a burn or something for an assertiveness.  However, given the fact that it can be had for $18 it is an incredible value! 

I cannot wait until I can have a few friends over for a bourbon tasting and sneak this one is as a wildcard. I am sure that it will get far better reviews in a blind tasting than if I brought a bottle to poker night."

3.0,"Great for mixing, a bit harsh for sipping but not bad."
3.5,Highly underrated bourbon. Probably one of the sweeter ones I have tasted with a very light buttery tone underneath. I think the lower proof actually serves to bring out the classic bourbon flavors and so I would actually prefer this over the white label. Also got a 1.75 L for $20 so that’s pretty unbeatable.
3.75,"In terms of a budget whiskey, this is my absolute go to."

3.25,"For the money a fine bourbon. Some vanilla and depth, just a bit rough around the edges. Very nice aroma. Fine for mixing but a little less sweet than a “standard” cocktail choice (Buffalo Trace). Not to sip, but a good bargain!"
2.5,"Nose - Oak spice, barrel tannins, hint of caramel
Taste - astringent, oak spice, small note of lemon and vanilla
Finish - thin, bitter, light burn"
1.5,This wasn't a bad bourbon but was just too thin. It really didn't have much of anything to it and had a really short finish. For this price point I prefer Ezra Brooks or Benchmark.
3.0,"Another budget bourbon contender. Great value for $10-12 so gets some points there. Poured neat, average legs with good mouthfeel. Nose is very similar to Beam Black with cola like vanilla, oak, dusty cardboard, some spice and a little heat. Palate has soft sweet oaky vanilla bean, heated spice and light char. There is a note running through the nose and taste that was tough for me to identify but then it hit me (don't laugh) ..play dough..but it blends in well and adds character. Finish is fading spicy sweet and strong barrel oak, black pepper and dry char. Overall pleased with this bourbon. Its really solid flavor for price. Nothing special, complex or intense but has low price with ample taste and body. Lots of vanilla and spicy pepper make it an easy purchase and worth cheap rotation spot to save the A rated bourbons...........80/100......Little bump for value"

2.0,Fuller flavor than Jim Beam. A better choice at $15
3.0,"Certainly not top shelf. But acceptable to have on the shelf. It's cheap, and works surprisingly well for the price. I would not call this a good drink to have neat or on the rocks, this is better for mixing."
4.0,I like the taste and the smell of it.

4.0,"straight and strong bourbon, nice for cocktails"
4.0,for the price its great. I prefer something a little bolder and higher proof for drinks so that the bourbon doesnt get completley lost. for example the bonded even williams or wild turkey 101. Great alternative to other cheap qhiakeys in the same price range thoug like jack daniels or jim beam
