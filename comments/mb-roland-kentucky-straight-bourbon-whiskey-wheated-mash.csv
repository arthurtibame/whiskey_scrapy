0.5,"Pure ethanol on the nose. Little bit of sour mash corn. Palate is rough. Nothing sweet like you would expect from a wheated bourbon. In fact, although it may technically meet the guidelines, it does not taste like a bourbon at all. People trying to compare this to the Larceny, Weller and Pappy wheated bourbons are out of their minds. This stuff is swill. Save your $50+ and go with Weller SR for $25."
