5.0,"Hi, my name is José and i am a talisker fan.

I was dictating a whisky course and the house host asked me to review one of his whiskies. Excitement was felt right away. He grabbed his 1999 D.E. of Talisker and i knew i was going to have a nice time.

This is actually a very different Talisker, specially on the nose. It is finished in Amoroso casks. 

As always, 45.8% abv, tawny color.

On the nose, bacon, bonfire, vanilla, salt, cherries, coastal, maritime aroma notes. It is very sweet but also salty and also peaty.  Great.

On the palate is beautiful: cake, toffee, pepper, MINT LIQUOR (lovely), peat. Amazing.

Finish is very long, herbal and salty, very peaty. Earthy peat. Heather peat. 

Overall this is a spectacular dram, didn't make it to a perfect score but it was close: 96/100. Slainte!"
