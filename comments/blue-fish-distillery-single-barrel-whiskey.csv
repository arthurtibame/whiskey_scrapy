4.0,"This whiskey is a caramel syrup gold color with semi- thin watery legs noticeable on the inside.

The nose is overall fruity sweet and peaty with notes of honey, floral, citrus, cherry, banana, vanilla, caramel apple, mild peat, and salty sea brine.

The palate has a watery mouthfeel and is overall sweet with notes orange, cinnamon sugar, cherry candy, Whoppers milk chocolate malt balls, and more salty peat as the whiskey opens up.

The finish is long, soft, and sweet & salty.

First, I’m sad to say that Blue Fish Distillery is no longer in business, so this bottle was one of the last ones in existence to my knowledge. That being said, I am blessed to have been able to try it. From batch #20 bottle #1,817, the whiskey is made with 70% Irish malt and 30% peated malt barley and the peatiness is so fun to find in a local whiskey. I really enjoy this whiskey and wish to see more like it! Cheers!"
