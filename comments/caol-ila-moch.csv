5.0,"I think the 84 rating doesn't do it proper justice. Great mouthfeel, super smooth, plenty of flavor and a proper lingering finish. The relatively low price further elevates this in my opinion. I'd much rather drink this than the standard 10 or 12 year offerings from the big boys."

4.0,"[Whisky Live Paris 2015] Looking forward to accumulating my own bottle.  Had this paired with olive spread over bread, hosted by a famous French chef. Great mix of flavor and texture, with a peaty, earthy presence.  A bit dense to drink swiftly, but it was not made to be consumed so!"

4.0,Less peat than the normal Coal Ila. Seems to be aimed at making Caol Ila more accessible to younger people. Nonetheless a very pleasant dram with milk chocolate and stone fruit overtones.

4.0,"This is really savory and appealing up front. Clarified Butter, bacon, white pepper, and heather. Smokey palate with lots of powdery malt. If you really chew through this you can find a lot. Lemon oil, marshmallow fluff, ground spices. It's a bit thin and a little short lived but A+ for complexity."

3.0,"Bright and smooth start, but a weak finish as the flavor seems to drop off at the end."
4.0,"This is another bottle I had thrown in with an international order several months back.  My experience with Caol Ila is rather limited, especially with their traditional peated range.  I’ve had the 12 year, but everything else I’ve sampled has been from their limited released, unpeated line:  15yo and 17yo.  This Moch is a re-issue of their new, NAS line.  It’s bottled at 43% and cost me $60, plus shipping.

It’s yellow gold, oily and makes tons of legs and big, watery drops when you spin it in your favorite Glencairn.  The nose was primarily butterscotch, light earthy peat smoke and very faint oak cask.  No issues with the ABV whatsoever.  The palate was slightly warming with a nice buttery, BBQ smoke.  There was hints of oak and vanilla before it turned salty and dry after mid sip.  The finish was medium in length, peaty yet ultimately salty and dry.  I don’t have any issues with the NAS aspect here:  it isn’t abrasive or overly hot.  It does a nice job at being light and very approachable.

Overall, it’s solid although the price point is a bit high for what you’re getting.  I could see turning to this when you want a little something Islay-esque, without the crazy flavor complexity.  It would also be a nice shift in the middle of a tasting event as you prepare your palate for something heavier or as you switch back to unpeated, sherried whisky.  3.5-3.75 stars, but I think I’d bum a pour or try it in a bar for under $7-8 instead of buying another bottle.  Cheers."
3.0,Peaty. Sweet. Metallic at the end
3.0,"This is more of an earthy Caol Ila... The color is light, but the vegetative notes and peat are up front. Sweet and floral notes show up as well on the nose. Pears, apples, vanilla, peat...slight though. The palate is heavier on the smoke. This also reminds me a little bit like a Glen Scotia. It has some maritime, savory goodness. Almost like a mushroom gravy...  A medium finish of seashells... Salty brine. I do like the standard 12 a little better, but to me it's a hell of a lot better than their unpeated offerings. On the thin and light side for Islay, but not shabby. Going to give it a straight up 3 stars. A little overpriced because you have to get if from overseas. The theme for this dram is ""Rainy Day Mushroom Pillow"" by the Strawberry Alarm Clock."
4.0,Nice peaty notes without being overpowering.

3.5,Sampled this amongst a number of others with a couple of mates. Starts off good with the mild peat base built upon by an added richness of flavour from the finish. However by the end of the dram tastes a bit artificial. 3.5
3.0,"Feis Ile 2018 update.  I had a dram of this whisky at Islay House Hotel, on the recommendation of a person who works at Lagavulin and one of the bartenders.  It’s a more Lagavulin-like Caol Ila, so I can see why some will like it and some will be put off.  The nose is very dry, mainly featuring a vegetal, dried-mushroom peat.  The palate has more classic Caol Ila vanilla and citrus sweetness, and very little smoke.  The smoke shows up on the finish."

4.25,"“Moch” Meaning “Dawn” in Gaelic fits this dram perfectly. Super light and fresh compared to the standard range. Salty bacon, fresh stone fruits with a black pepper back note on the nose. On the palate the fresh notes continue with the stone fruits coming forward with milk chocolate and the classic Caol Ila Peat smile. #BreakfeastWhisky 🥃

3.5,"Big thanks to @LeeEvolved for this generous sample! I have working thru a batch of samples of late as you can tell if you follow my reviews they have been scotch centric (versus my typical heavy lean to American Whiskey). This is purposeful as I am looking to gain a better understanding of the world of Scotch. This one is another Peated Scotch in my journey and I must say I am certainly developing a fondness for them. Let's dive in:
On the palette it's a pretty soft and honey filled entry with a billow of smoke following. As the smoke recedes we are left with some earthy notes, oak and then the return of sweeter notes like toffee and caramel. The finish is a medium length with more honey, oak and smoke. It's a bit drying and satisfying. 
All in all it's a nice summer pour that is one of the lighter Peated Scotches I have tasted. 
Cheers again @LeeEvolved and cheers all!"

4.0,"Gifted as a K.K present - thanks again! 
Nose: Strong briney salt and smoke with subtle hints of hard-boiled lemon candy and vanilla. A little peppery at the end.
Palate: The smoke and peat intensifies. The sweetness of the vanilla progresses to more of a buttery Wether's Original lolly.
Finish: Long but subtle - not a peat punch in the face but a sweet toffee-esque heartwarming after taste. An easy drinker."
