A few drops of water mutes the smoke but leaves it tantalizing you in the background. Cinnamon and honey come forward for a new great experience. A Fantastic whisky."

Noses of light combination of dark fruits and hints to cognac while in contact with the  mouth. Quite nice, but I'm not sure if its better than the cheaper JWs, or just different, and in some ways, smoother."

4.0,"After another weekend stint to Maryland, got home, grabbed some sushi and opened the JWP to wind down from the drive.  I have a soft spot for JW as I really started enjoying Scotch with JW Black slowly working to single malts.  Every now and then, having a blend to sip is refreshing and usually uncomplicated and perfect for those moments when you just need a dose of easy.
  
  The nose is soft and mild of apples and cereal touched with honey and cinnamon.  Let it open and over time the aromas intensify. Like the nose, this is soft.  The whisky delivers sweet tea, honey, salted caramel and a bit of a cereal, like Frosted Flakes.  A small trace of almonds are detectable.  There is a slight tinge of cinnamon and remnants of honey, oak and dark chocolate all which linger for a good amount of time.
  
  I found this an enjoyable dram that's easy, sweet and comfortable.  A solid blend.  That being said, this is a worthy dram if it was priced accordingly.  For under $60, it's a decent value. Anything higher than that and I think one can find an equal or better blend for less money; which I had the good fortune of attaining at a reasonable price.  [Dry glass: caramels][$49][88/100][Opened: 10/23/16]"

We mostly agree that Green is the king of the traditional Johnny line, but this gives Green a run and was almost unanimously rated above Blue in our small, perhaps unqualified judgments. Great bottle to have on hand to think important matters over."

4.0,Nose is light but nice! Fruit and honey. Taste is tight and integrated like no normal Johnnie blend. This has some real class about it. Its oily and made with nice wood. This dram is just on the sweet side but not a desert dram as it has a touch of smoke and dare I say peat. There is also a citrus note that makes this beautifully layered. I personally prefer Green label but this is top stuff....but price is too high especially when you compare to Green. 4 stars or 93

There's definitely peat and smoke, with a nice touch of raisins and a nuttiness I would describe as being close to walnuts and hazelnuts. The finish is dry and not unpleasant, with vanilla, honey and wood.  Not bad."
3.75,Very good for a blended whiskey. Smooth with a great chocolate taste. Makes for a good dessert whiskey. Not overly complex and the finish is a touch sour. I prefer this over the more watery Blue label but the Green label is my JW of choice.

4.0,"Nose: Satisfying and integrated. Sweet and floral, but with an underpinning oily oakiness that is very appealing. At first it might seem too laid-back but I'd recommend allowing it to rest in the glass for at least 15 minutes. It will repay your patience with a nose that is akin to Green Label, but lower in intensity and with an admixture of very good grain. It's a more sophisticated nose than the Gold Label, which in comparison seems overly sweet.

Palate: Rich and sweet, fruity, malty, some sherry. Quite complex with a foundation of some nice oily grain.  A lovely mouthfeel.  It seems to combine most everything that is in the Johnnie Walker catalogue of flavours.

Finish: Soft and medium with lingering oak, honey and a touch of smoke, but also some sour/bitter notes - these seem to be characteristic of all Johnnie Walker blends.

This is a little bit like Black Label and Gold Label blended together and turned up in intensity to produce a ""blend that has everything"". It does have a lot more going for it than the Gold Label Reserve, but the price is hard to justify because in the end this is a good, but not earth-shattering, blended scotch that is no better than several other blends that are 3/4 the price or a number of malts that are the same price or cheaper.

For the same price I can buy a bottle of Kilkerran 12 or Lagavulin 16 - no competition. In terms of value it only deserves 3 stars, but on the basis of quality it just barely makes it over the line to 4 stars. This and Blue Label are the show ponies of the JW grain blend range, but they do what they do in quite different ways.  However in the final analysis neither holds a candle to Green Label.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

4.25,You know that star athlete that was always over shadowed by another player but you swear he is better? Well that’s how I feel about the Platinum compared to the Blue Label. This is more complex than the Blue. If you switched the price tag on the two I would not complain at all.
null,"smoke from the barrel, peat, oak. fresh oak. earthy. 

not heavy smoke on the nose but the pest truly hits when you sip it. I feel back in an autumn Forrest from my hometown when I sip this dram. 

perhaps the smoke of laphroig or talisker. not quite ardbeg or laguvulin. but the orange citrus if a buffalo trace"

3.75,"Nose - Dark vanilla, barrel aged apple/pear cider, light hint of leather, dark caramel, honey.

Taste - Fairly thin but has a nice ""richer"" mouthfeel, nice light white pepper tingle, dark caramel, dark apple/pear cider, light brine

Finish - Lingering dark apple/pear cider sweetness, dark caramel, very light brine

Score - 83/100

Final Thoughts - This is quite a step up from the Black & the Gold in that the nose just is so much more balanced. It smells older in that it has this intangible richness that only comes with time in an oak barrel. The sweetness was darker & more rich although still quite one-dimensional. This is something I could actually see myself sipping on very easily. Not complex, not off-putting or off flavors.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - Maybe"

3.75,"Nose: Creamy light fruit with a slight medicinal smell

Palate- very light and grassy, slightly medicinal, super light to the point where f you eat almost anything with it or drink before it you cover it up.
Finish: the medicinal flavor fades to a slightly cream aftertaste.

Okay drink just not worth the price"

Nose: light citrus, soda fizz/carbonation accompanied by light smoke, lavender all mixed in together 
Palate: light, very elegant sweetness  accompanied by a carbonated taste  on arrival, enveloped by a very light smoke 
Finish: light European oak tang, light smoke, dark chocolate 

Overall very light but somehow enticing entry from the JW line up"

4.0,"Deep oaky color with a touch of orange. Slightly floral aroma with hints of smoke. Smoky caramel in flavor at first. Transitions a pepper which lingers pleasantly through the finish. The peat comes through with a touch of water, but not obnoxiously like some Scotch’s."
5.0,Its johnnie and that's all you need. No one blends the way they do in relation to their higher quality blends. Its Fn delicious. Nuff said

4.5,"Nose: Malty, with sweet cream, vanilla notes of candied almonds, toffee, caramel, very thin whiff of smoke.

Palate: Sweet & warming, creamy malt, oats & cereal. A spicy vanilla cinnamon dusting too with gentle smoke.

Finish: Dark chocolate with caramelized peel."
4.75,"A very solid whisky. Is a good dram, elegant, perfumed. 

On the nose i got gentle, very gentle vanilla and peat, almost as it is hidding but you can perceive it. You can get some spices on the nose, and maybe toffee.

On the palate is hot, full bodied, not that complex, spicy but hot overall, oakiness is present, also cereal (which i first thought was banana) and the finish is strong but medium with dark chocolate all over it. I expected for it to be more complex, but overall is an elegant whisky, superior to Old Parr superior and chivas 18. I am fairly dissapointed with 18 year old whiskies because there are younger whiskies out there that are better."

3.5,"Warm caramel, smoke, and peaty aroma. First taste is smoky and slightly sweet. The smoke and the bitterness both intensify with time. The peat really comes through in the finish leaving you with a warm smoky bitter taste. A touch of water balances things out. A bit more peaty than I prefer but good."
