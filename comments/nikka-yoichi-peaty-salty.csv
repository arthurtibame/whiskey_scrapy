4.25,"Amazing. It’s peaty and salty, but also sweet and rich. Good with ice ball or a little water. 93"

5.0,"Remarkable for what it is. 
  
  A bit medicinal on the nose. 
  
  First taste is that classic Yoichi vanilla sweetness, but it immediately fades to a wonderfully Peaty, Briney glow. 
  
  Body is a bit thin, due to the lack of an age statement, but the way it lingers in your mouth is the stuff Islay dreams are made of."

1.25,"Nosing: sweet aromatic barbecue, very pleasant to the nose. 

Flavour: young and spiciness hits you in the front, saltiness is distinct and taste like swallowing of harsh pile of salt

Finish: smooth smokiness - light"

4.0,"Light peat on the nose. Smooth and sweet at first, the peat and smoke in the middle, and finishes with brine and a salty aftertaste. Body is quite thin but the taste packs a punch, good for those who don’t like the peaty normally. Really nice, extremely expensive."
3.0,Definitely feel the peat in the nose and after taste. The salt leaves me feeling a little dry.
