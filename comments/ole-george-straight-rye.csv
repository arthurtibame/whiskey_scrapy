4.0,"My neighbors went out of town for a weekend and asked me to watch their dog. I wasn’t expecting any sort of repayment but much to my delight they brought me back a half bottle of Ole George from Grand Traverse Distillery, a craft distillery in Traverse City, Michigan (the very place they were visiting!). Ole George is a 100% rye whiskey with a mash bill of 95% unmalted and 5% malted rye. I believe the age is somewhere around 4-5 years but I’m not entirely sure. It’s bottled at 46.5% ABV and is non chill filtered and natural color of dark amber. 

The nose opens with lots of herbal and spicy rye notes, along with plenty of vanilla and mint. Some oak is present, but the main woody note is actually sandalwood. A fair amount of nutmeg with a little clove in there as well. Caramel corn, pecans and dark chocolate. After sitting a while it becomes much sweeter with more caramel, some toffee and a slight bubblegum note. There is a gentle underlying fruitiness in the form of cherries, pears and strawberries which helps to break up the spicy/sweet dichotomy. Vanilla pudding, buttery over cooked crescent rolls and barrel char. There is a very light dill note, of which I’m glad that it’s light as there are other ryes or high rye bourbons out there with heavy dill notes that really turn me off to ryes. 

The palate is sweet on the arrival but quickly turns to a spicy/sweet, rye heavy profile with lots of vanilla and sandalwood like on the nose. It’s quite earthy, like a nutrient rich soil and mulch. This was quite odd at first and I didn’t much care for it, but after a few drams I came to enjoy it. Peanuts, walnuts and a bit peppery. Some pine and oak to go along with the sandalwood, quite woody. More rye and peanuts with some mint and dill, but very light on those last two. Orange oil and pipe tobacco round out the experience. 

A medium bodied mouthfeel that is lightly oily and dry. 
The finish is long with rye, peanuts, vanilla, earthy and dry. 

I wasn’t sure what to make of this one when I first opened the bottle. It was very rye heavy, which I typically don’t like, but after working through the bottle I came to appreciate its strong character as well as it’s sweeter side. I’m not sure what the price point is with this bottle, but I would imagine it’s fairly high owing to the fact that it’s from a craft distillery. Price aside, I would have to recommend this to rye fans out there for its uniqueness. A solid 4. 
Cheers"

3.0,"[11.23.15] Another fine catch at the Frankenmuth tasting house. This was the fourth Grand Traverse I tasted that morning (yes, 10 am on a Monday is just fine with me), so my judgment could be biased. The rep said this is their most popular offering but I would say I liked the double barrel better. 

This has all of the white dog rye sweetness of the OYO variety but the spice has been pilfered by the barrel. You'd never believe this was rye if you didn't have a memory of that cranky sweetness that hides in a strong rye blend. Like their other offerings, the oak does catch up with you but lurks in the shadows with the pepper. As has already been said on here - this is a fine sipping rye."
