4.25,Nice to know I'm not insane for dumping on the Talisker. Heaps better.
4.25,This has become one of my gold standards. Just a nice balance of everything including smoke and peat.

4.5,"This is a fabulous whisky. I bought a bottle of the original anniversary release for $50 when it came out in 2016 but only opened it a few weeks ago. It’s a wonderful balance of kipper smoke and sweet caramel lozenges and while not particularly complex it’s deliciously rich and satisfying without a bad note to its score. If the more recent batches are as good as this, it’s surely one of the best values in peated Scotch right now."

4.5,"Nose: Primarily sweet with undertones of peat and smoke, and a bit of brine.

Taste: Fruity and vanilla flavors give way to strong peat and smoky finish."

4.0,"Tasting with a cigar tonight, more peat on the nose than the palate.  Palate is sweet and viscous with a decently long finish. Not my favorite Lagavulin, but still very good."

3.75,Peat and smoke as you’d expect. Little sweetness and tasty for the price. But not as interesting as the Ardbeg 10.

3.5,"Warm, smooth, light on the peat (kind of), and doesn't hurt the wallet too much either."

4.25,"Junior-varsity Lagavulin, but nothing wrong with that.  So gulpable that I wouldn’t have guessed it’s 48% ABV.  Super light straw color.  Nose is more perfume and petrol than peat, though the smoke is there in the background.  Pasta and asparagus and salt water in the mouth.  Mid-length finish.  Not nearly as complex as the 16, obviously, but it’s a steal in comparison."
