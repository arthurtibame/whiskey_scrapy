4.0,"Each Dramfest in Christchurch (every two years) Whisky Galore the whisky retailer that runs the festival selects a special bottling. This one was bottled at cask strength. So onto the review - Dramfest '18. Day 2. Very easy to drink at cask strength. Lovely drop, peat, sweet, vanilla. Def one of my favourite Benromach's up there if not better than the 10. Around $100USD here in NZD"
