3.5,"Like the McKenna 10yr I get a lot of alcohol on the nose, also some oak.  This is the smoothest of the flight so far (ER10yr, McKenna 10yr before this).  I wasn't sure how to describe the finish so I turned to the professional reviews.  And I think I agree with a cinnamon and nutmeg finish, but it turns to a menthol towards the end which is a negative for me."

4.0,"A fine bourbon, great quality for the price. Full bodied, hint of smoke, much rounder than the black label Ezra."
3.0,Good burn flavors a bit muddled.
null,For the price a great drinking whiskey. Smooth finish for almost 100 proof. It's not Pappy but it's a fraction of the cost and simply tastes good going down.

2.0,"Very good.  Close to Makers Mark, the 90 proof.
The 40% alcohol is not very good.  Dropped from 4 stars to 2.  Rae's favorite."

3.0,"This was a standby for me back in college - a tough whiskey to scare off the weak ones when we went out for a night. This has a bit that comes with the higher proof that will pucker the face of many a young one. Mixes very well in my experience, but also is great on ice with cherries. It helps bring out the fruity subtleties that can otherwise be lost in the wash of corn grain alcohol and light barrel spice. Good buy that will separate a crowd."

1.0,"It has a truly beautiful, vanilla nose. One of the best noses of any bourbon. On the first sip it is very smooth, and has a pleasant burnt sugar note. However, it has ZERO finish, which left the sipping experience disappointing."

4.0,I give it 4 stars simply because it is uniquely different in my opinion and tasty!
4.0,"[03.24.2016] Found this bottle in Chicago last year and have been saving it til I felt the urge (or Distiller reviewed it). Lost power tonight, so it seemed like a good time to go blind into a whiskey tasting. 

If I didn't know better, I would say this is a lower year version of a higher brand whiskey. If you drink the black label Ezra for anything (I drink it straight when I'm cleaning the bikes), you'll find this to be a real pleasure.

Previous reviewers have ignored the fact that it's pretty hard to find affordable higher proof whiskey, and this fills that void at 99 proof. Smoothed out by barrel aging, this still has some of the raspiness of the Ezra B. buzz saw known to torment my liver in my younger years. Vanilla is strong, oak is subtle and very spicy/peppery finish. There's some brown sugar and caramel that emerges with patience but air never opens up a decent aroma. Good buy and a good whiskey to share but probably not something I'll keep in stock regularly."

3.0,"This is not a bad bourbon, but there are much better ones out there. The nose has aromas of charred oak and vanilla, and it comes across as being more sweet than it is fruity. The palate is instead quite spicy, with generous doses of peppers and nutmeg complementing a nice vanilla flavor. The finish itself is largely forgettable, though nice, and has me jonesing for a better bourbon."

2.0,If possible this bourbon is almost too complex. There is good in it and there is bad in it and it is a roller coaster ride between the two. It just unfortunately seems that there is more bad than good...
4.25,"Nice and warm, lots of Orange in the finish, definitely Heaven Hill juice. Nice balance between the sweetness and oak/slight spice from the age"

3.5,"pretty strong and grain forward. little too forceful and not anything beyond the grain for my liking. Water opens it up and cuts a lot of the harshness, makes it much better. Only the age saves it from mediocrity."
