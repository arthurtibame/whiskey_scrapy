1.0,Smaka skit
4.75,"This is, quite frankly, stunning whiskey.  Hats off and a well-earned score for the Roughstock crew.  Can’t wait to try more from these guys.

Nose:  Oh, wow.  Like a dry brushfire.  Creamy caramel and toffee (that grow with time in the glass).  Butter tarts and raw pastry (salty dough).  Dark fruits and pepper.  Cinnamon and other spices.  Orange, apple and pear.  A slight char, smoky edge.

Palate:  A little more youth showing here, but it’s still not a ‘young’ whisky.  Wow!  Toasted oak.  Apple skins, ginger, pepper and sharp clove or cinnamon.  Moist dried fruit.  Burnt sugars or very dark caramel.  A note of what I imagine to be bruleed orange peel.  Long finish on green apple skins and oak notes.

Thoughts:  This is ‘manly’ whiskey that would appeal to a lot of the men and women I know.  Over a hundred bucks a bottle, but I would buy this again anytime."
