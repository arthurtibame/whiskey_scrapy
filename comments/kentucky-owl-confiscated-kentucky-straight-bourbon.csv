3.75,"Tasting:  Neat in Kentucky Libby Glass.  2oz pour.

Nose: (4.0) Traditional bourbon nose.  plenty of brown sugar sweetness, vanilla, and oak.  Nothing complex but sweet, traditional, and straightforward.

Palate: (4.0)  Hotter than I had expected for the proof.  Good coating mouthfeel without being oily.  Got some syrup and vanilla, the oak was a bit tannic.  Not horribly so but a little too drying.

Finish: (3.75)  A bit too drying for me.  It did hang around for a bit, and gave a nice caramel after taste.  The finish seemed like a newer whiskey might have.  Yearned for just a little more oomf.

Overall:  I liked it.  But I also liked that this was my friend's bottle and I didn't have to step up to the $129 price tag to  try it.  Here is my impression-  it is a great $60 bottle......except it is priced twice that🙁.  To me I found the same pleasant taste, a bit more oomf on the finish, and similar profile with OF 1920 or 1910 for $54.  Hard to justify over $100 for NAS, not single barrel, or barrel proof when stuff like Elijah Craig A119 is out for less than half the price....and in my opinion better😉.  Had a like/hate relationship with this one.  I liked the juice but hate the price.  Cheers!"

3.25,"I got a chance to get a free sample of this one during my staycation at the wonderful JW Marriott here in Phoenix. I was enjoying a pour of their own private barrel of Blanton's (that one was really tasty) when they gave me a 1 oz pour of this one. So I'll do my best to describe it, but obviously it will be limited! 
This is probably the most polarizing Bourbon out there right now given it's high cost, lack of transparency and perceived dive in quality with Stoli (yes the vodka Stoli) first mass Whiskey release. 
On to the tasting:
Upon entry it's pretty soft and definitely sweet. Notes of toffee, vanilla and caramel jump out. Oak, tobacco and slight leather come out during the mid palette and medium finish that adds cinnamon. 
It's actually much tastier than I expected. It's well constructed and if it were in the $50 range, I'd buy it for sure. The rub here of course is the price. It's way over priced and just not premium in anyway. 
In short, good Bourbon but terrible value. 
Cheers all!"

3.0,The smell is a little more tolerable than the original.
3.5,"If you love cult status whiskey and you have money to burn this is the bourbon for you.  It is nuanced, very well made.  But...It is not worth the $130 price point.  Its good.  But not that good.   I'd rather go to scotch whisky at this price point. If it were $80 I would buy it again."

3.25,"The nose is astringent, but no real takeaways beside a bit of sugar. Body is a burst of sugar and caramel. Bit of oak in there as well. Finish turns bitter quickly, and trails away with oak and almond.

So have you ever had a friend who built up a video game for like 2 years, and for whatever reason you couldn’t find it in your area, so you just wait in anticipation of how delicious this video game must be. Years later, it finally shows up in your local GameStop in new packaging, and you’re like... is this the same game? Did they change something? And the sticker price seems a bit high, but you buy it and give it a spin only to find out that the graphics are a bit outdated and you regret wasting your money, because it’s just okay, but there’s tons of better games out there that you could’ve bought instead? Yeah me neither."
2.0,"I’ve been very critical of Kentucky owl and rightly so. When you’re starting price point for a bourbon or rye is north of $100 you set a high expectation of your product and tell your customer this is a preeminent bourbon. 

Confiscated is simply not worth the $130-$150 that they charge for it. It’s a solid $50 bourbon at best. 

Do yourself a favor skip this and pick up Russell’s reserve single barrel instead."

4.0,"Orange/copper color.
Mild wood-spice and light butterscotch on the nose.
Complex flavor profile with a nice burn at the back of the throat. 
Mouthfeel starts out a bit thin, but becomes a bit more soft and velvety as it sits.
This particular bottle has received a fair amount of criticism for both its price point and lack of age statement. While I do agree it’s a bit overpriced and young, there’s a lot to like about this bourbon. If you’re accustomed to paying $100 dollars or more for a bottle of whiskey, you won’t be disappointed after you let this one open up a bit."

4.0,"Had the chance to talk with a Kentucky Owl rep. From my notes it’s a blend of four bourbons, aged six, eight, ten, and twelve years. Nicely balanced with some smoke and vanilla. Layers of flavor including cherry and anise/licorice? Some bready, maybe graham cracker. Long finish with a return of vanilla and cinnamon. I’d buy again."
4.0,Good nose but doesn't reveal how good the pallet is. A bit of heat just after the flavors hit you.
4.25,"This bourbon is very brown. No age statement but sipping on this you can tell there is some older bourbon mixed in. This goes down very easy with little to no burn or bite. Got a little cinnamon, apple, brown sugar/honey notes on the palate. Has a very short finish. Does not linger at all. This would be a dangerous one to be drinking given how easy it is straight. Maybe some people will find it boring but I enjoy this."
4.25,"Definitely a blended MGP. There has to be some older stuff to it, because it’s DARK in color. 96.4 proof so it’s easy to sip. Definitely some rye spices that you feel at the back of your throat. Great nose, lingering finish. $150 is a high price but it reminds me of the yellow stone special edition."

3.25,"I really wanted to give this a glowing recommendation. I love the story behind this bourbon and everything Dixon Dedman is doing to resurrect the brand. However, this bottle is about $40 too expensive. At $99, I feel like this should be an exceptional whiskey. It's not. That doesn't mean it's a bad one. It's very drinkable and the floral and fruity notes carry it forward to a medium-length finish. But it's astringent on the nose and the taste lacks the depth and dark, rich flavors that I love about higher-end bourbon. And the lower proof point doesn't help it. I recommend you try a pour of it before buying a bottle."

2.5,"Straight, middle of the road Bourbon. Tried it next to many other offerings at a tasting and this was not better than some $40 offerings. this is sourced, NAS, sub-100 proof whiskey that would not command more than $35 with any other label.

3/5 but loses half a point for that ridiculous MSRP"

up front you can get everything the nose detected. butterscotch vanilla and hints of banana. the after taste has a slight burn but overall very smooth. can taste the leather/ Tobacco the oak leaves in your mouth but not over powering. very sweet bourbon whiskey."

4.25,"A somewhat delicate nose, with mild oak suggesting some aging.  The palate is rounded, with some delicate flavors as well, and not on the sweeter side as some Bourbons can be.  The finish is lengthy, with some cinnamon spice, and the oak spice being reigned in. This is a nice bourbon, and suggests some age.  The lack of information and transparency provided by Kentucky Owl makes the price high, and as a consumer, would pass.  My score was 87.5"

4.0,"There is a lot going on here that isn’t very well explained which seems to result in a fairly ridiculous suggested retail price and several unanswered questions... But for arguments sake, I’m going to share my theory on what I think is Kentucky Owl’s middle finger to the current bourbon market resurgence.

There’s no age statement, no printed mash bill, no disclosed source or blending recipe... pretty much all the marketing tools the rest of the major distilleries are using to sell “elusive bourbon” that people are trampling all over each other to find. The only real info of substance is the proof (kinda low though). BUT! the balance, flavor, and overall enjoyment is there regardless of where it came from of exactly how long it sat in a barrel! So why pay or charge around a $100?

Here’s why (at least what I think), if they added all that normally expected info and placed it on the shelf for the price point of $40-$50 like everyone seems to think it should be, every single bourbon nube would be hunting it down and flipping it on the BSM for twice what it is selling for now. All that said, I literally just saw a shelf full of this a Costco for $74 and nobody is batting an eye at it cause it’s still “too expensive.” Keep in mind, the majority of today’s bourbon drinkers are willing to pay $160 for W12 and way more for WFE selections with almost the same amount of disclosed information.

I know this is a long rant, so I’ll wrap it up. Buy it or don’t buy it, but understand two things... First, the current bourbon market economy is largely controlled by the war between the BSM and the independent liquor retailers leaving less revenue for the distilleries for future production/expansion and less affordable bottles for people who actually drink bourbon. Kentucky Owl has set a manageable price point to maintain supply/demand of a quality and tasty bourbon. Second, the average bourbon “consumer” isn’t consuming anything at all, they’re buying it to either re-sell it or put it in their bar like a trophy or something to brag about.

If you truly love bourbon, $100 bucks isn’t that much these days for a craft bourbon that is nationally available. Have some courage and buy a bottle just to drink it and make the decision for yourself, just understand that Kentucky Owl Confiscated is breaking the status quo of the current market by circumventing the BSM thru setting a reasonable price point for a quality craft bourbon. Stop flipping and start drinking! That’s the only way prices will remain reasonable."

Very very complex. I can’t tell the smell or the taste. But somewhat sour? Kinda? Almost like a cucumber or pickle???"
4.25,"Nose: I get a lot of banana pudding, specifically the vanilla wafers. It smells very smooth and not too strong. Reminds me of an island breeze, when I’m putting on sunblock. 

Taste: I mean wow...so many different things going on here. I oddly taste cucumber water at first, but that very quickly turns into vanilla and oak. But that very quickly turns into warming spices as it runs down the throat.

4.0,"Bright Copper in color.  Aroma of cinnamon with both some vanilla and mint.  More sweetness and caramel as it opens.  Beautiful toasted bread notes. Caramel early and coffee notes later on the tongue.  Seems to be a good deal of Rye in the spice.  Huge finish here which is the highlight of this Bourbon.  Toasted oak, moment of Maple and dark chocolate. Couple drops of water bring out some more chocolate notes."

5.0,"At first I got caramelized banana on the nose. I took a sip and got some light grassy notes, a little citrus or lemongrass, and a smooth, mild baking spice. After the first sip, my wife and I agreed the scent changed - bubble gum. The cheap Double Bubble pieces we used to get for Halloween. Second sip, some woody caramelized barrel char flavors with a slightly herbal note. 3rd nose was empty marshmallow bag. Not marshmallow. Empty marshamallow bag. Weird, huh? It's that chalky, powdered sugary, light sweetness. 3rd sip... Still grassy, woody, barrel char type flavors. It gets a more oily mouth feel with each sip. Man... This is COMPLEX. Love this bourbon!"
