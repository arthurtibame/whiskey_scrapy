3.25,"Nose: Weak notes of caramel nuts, maybe even pitted fruit. 
Palate: Smooth, not too alcohol forward. Toffee, caramel, and baked bread notes.
Finish: Sharp, quick finish, but pleasantly sippable."
4.0,"I think I like the 100 proof one better. It’s got the same amount of bite as the 100 proof but a little less flavor. Still, a solid bourbon and full of sweet flavors. Can’t wait to try the 86, 90, and 94 proofs of this."

3.75,"Several months ago my wife went to Kentucky to visit family and I was on a business trip and could not go with her. I did send her some pictures of Bourbons to look for there that are difficult to find in South Carolina. This is one that she brought back for $14 and what a nice low-cost, 80 proof, and aged at least 3 years Bourbon this is. The liquid inside is smooth and somewhat flavorful but it is a bit thin. To me, it is similar to Evan Williams 1783 in that the flavor is all upfront and fades very quickly when swallowed. The flavor profile, however, is different than EW there is a sharpness and woodiness I do not find in EW. That is not to say it is bad but different. This is an 80 proof liquid and it mixes very well with many things but in a Manhattan, it does get lost a bit. This is a very nice Bourbon that I wish was more readily available here. Enjoy."
