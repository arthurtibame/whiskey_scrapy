4.0,Definitely one of the better young ones: good strong peat and a touch of the sea.

3.0,"Peat, leather, vanilla and fairly medicinal on the nose. Some orchard fruit, salt-sprinkled caramel, and hint of lemons on the palate. Long oaky finish, but slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall, a  decent dram considering its young age (6 years), but still pretty rough around the edges."

4.0,"I actually tried the 2008, very full flavored, nice peat Smooth but a little alcoholic, would do better with more age. Can taste the bourbon cask"

4.5,"Color: Straw.
Nose: Smoked meat, salty.
Taste: Smoke. Funk. Maybe apple, like a fruity spread of some kind.
Finish: Taste comes right into the finish maybe the funk rounds out a bit and becomes a taste akin to cheese."

3.5,was quite peated but also somewhat sweet! wasn’t as peated as I thought it would be though. However it was the smoothest of whiskeys either
