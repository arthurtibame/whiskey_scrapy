4.5,"The nose of the whiskey is dark and sweet with a smokey base upon which vanilla and spice rest.

Visually, the blend is strikingly beautiful.  It is dark and rich, reminiscent of the dark char of the barrels in which it is aged.

On the tongue, the whiskey has a rich spice that transitions into a sweet vanilla middle.  The finish is strong and settles into a pleasant glow in the chest.

The whiskey is highly reminiscent of a high rye bourbon.  It is excellent neat, and may be well enjoyed in a manhattan or other whiskey cocktail as well."
5.0,"Not a lot of nose, but a beautiful color. Sweetness of bourbon gives way to the spiciness of rye. Long lasting finish which is spicy richness."
5.0,"Less sweet than regular CR, a bit like bourbon"
3.0,"This whiskey is very familiar, but is indeed a darker, slower, and warmer dram as the name implies.

The nose is far less bright then deluxe or northern rye, presenting hints of corn, vanilla and oak, much more reminiscent of bourbon then Canadian whiskey.

The palate brings some initial sweetness, but it fades quickly to smooth and spicy corn notes. In this expression you can tell it wants to be different then it’s siblings.. it wants to play with the American whiskeys.

The finish is where the name gets to prove itself.. the charred barrels this was aged in make themselves known here with oak tannins and some of that peppery spice from the palate.

Overall this isn’t remarkably complex, nor something you think someone would write a 4 paragraph review about, but if you enjoy Crown, and don’t want an overly sweet version, this is the Crown for you."

2.75,"Just take the Deluxe (Vanilla, Caramel, Smooth as Butter) and add some more barrel spice and all-around fullness. For the small price increase over Deluxe, Black is worth the extra pennies."

2.75,"I drank this side-by-side with the Crown Royal Deluxe as a comparison. The Black is like the Deluxe, but with the flavors slightly amped up. Vanilla, maple, some citrus. The wood aftertaste is tempered a bit compared to the Deluxe. Instead, this whiskey has a bit more char/smokiness with some spice. 

I like it a bit better than Deluxe."
2.0,"Prune, raisins and alcohol on the nose. On the palate, it runs slightly hot with vanilla, soda, prunes and raisins. Decent but probably needs to be mixed with either Dr. Pepper or Coke. I probably wouldn’t buy again."

3.0,"I've been generally unimpressed by Canadian Whiskies. I picked up a couple 50 mls of this to see if it could change my mind. First impression? Love the color on this one. Dark, robust, almost coffee-like. Pleasant nose. Definite caramel with a smoky note as well. Neat, it Enters the palate with a sweetness that stays throughout. Bold oak and char definitely present. Pleasant burn on the finish. I usually find Canadian whisky ""thin"" with very little complexity. While this is not as complex as a good bourbon, it is very enjoyable and offers a great ""heavy"" mouth feel with several discernible characteristics. Way ahead of Crown's standard offering. the only thing that keeps this from earning a 4th star is when I think about dropping $30 on this one, I look at the Bourbon aisle and see Elijah Craig 12, or Buffalo Trace or Old Granddad BIB. All less money and all better whiskies IMHO."

If you enjoy the aroma of a good bourbon, the sweetness, the charred wood, but not as big a fan of the sharpness and warmth that usually follows, then this could be for you. The nose is a lot like a bourbon, but the pallatte is soft and sweet like most any crown royal. A decent compromise, but I prefer regular old Crown when I want Canadian, and a solid bourbon like anything from Buffalo Trace when I want bourbon."

That being said, for the price this crown black ain't bad.  When it's this smokey I prefer it a bit more salty, but yeah this is somewhere between a smokey scotch and a decently smooth cheap bourbon.  I recommend giving it at least a try.  I don't hate it, I don't love it.  In my opinion it's okay.  Sure does smell nice, aired out almost smells like Maker's a bit.  Straight out the bottle no air, it smells harsh.  The taste is smooth for this price range."

3.0,"Had this at a friend's birthday party over the weekend. Mostly a beer and wine crowd avoiding a spirits table populated with the usual suspects: vodka, rum, gin, and a new 1.75L of Crown Royal Black, which I was happy to break the seal on. In the glass it is a dark amber and looks like a Coca-Cola. The nose also reminds you of Coke with the sweet smell of caramel and a hint of vanilla. To taste, why not make it three for three, dousing the tongue with an avalanche of sweetness fit for a kid, and blocking out anything reminiscent of good whisky. It does, however, finish with a good dose of rye spiciness salvaging something from an otherwise disastrous pour. As repugnant as it seemed, it settled into a good sipper over the course of the afternoon, and when I went back to pour myself a third drink I was surprised to be greeted to an almost empty bottle. Shows you how much I know about people's wants and needs. The critic in me would like to rate this at 2 stars, but an afternoon of enjoyment is forcing me to give it 3. Well played, Crown Royal!  :)"

0.5,"I think I've only had Crown Royal Deluxe so I bought a 50 mL of this for $2.95. (In NC the 750 mL is $30.95.) Right off the bat, this nose is TERRIBLE. I'm a chemist and I generally do not huff solvents I frequently use, but this nose distinctly smells like a combination of isopropyl alcohol mixed with ketones or aldehydes. I might even smell something akin to ethyl acetate. Let me reiterate, this nose is TERRIBLE. Seriously, it smells like mixture of cheap organic solvents you'll find in commercially available products for household cleaners or topical medication. 

I honestly have no idea how the Expert Review can pass off this smell as ""smoky and robust."" I have a poor sense of smell due to genetics and all of my lackadaisical practices as an academic chemist, and I can still smell things in this whiskey that tell me I shouldn't drink this. But I did drink it, and you get a standard alcohol flavor that makes me think it won't kill me, it's just a crappy whiskey. I get no tasting notes outside of alcohol. If you gave me a blind taste test and said this was Aristocrat, I'd believe you. Do not buy this, it is a freaking waste of money for $30 a bottle."

2.5,"Appearance: The dark color in this deeper charred Canadian blend is that of a cake donut. Slowly finding their way back down the glass are the whisky’s thin watery legs.

Nose: It's a sharper nose of sawdust, car exhaust, and paint thinner notes at first, followed by, after a few minutes of breathing, caramel apples, vanilla, smoke, cherry, and dusty old book notes. With a splash of water it becomes less harsh and more honeyed and maple smelling.

Taste: On the palate I’d say this dram is most similar to a generic bourbon. there are notes oaky wood tannins, caramel, baking spices and cardamom, and a green sour/bitter note in the back of the throat. - really not much there. With a splash of water, it gains more candy apple sweet and ashy notes but drops most everything else.

Finish: The short medium finish is basically a hot sweet Twizzler candy. 

Thoughts: This particular offering from the Crown family I wasn’t the most impressed with. It was okay, but the notes and tastes just didn’t seem to fit together. It’s maybe worth trying, but not worth keeping in your collection. Thanks Crown Royal! Cheers!"
2.0,"This strangely smells like an herbal liqueur, and the nose is by far the most interesting part: licorice, cola, and hints of black pepper. The palate is a letdown though, as nothing but blank astringency hits you first, and then the muted flavors unbuckle themselves and slowly saunter to the front: ""prickly"" vanilla (think the cheapest of white rums), followed by a blast of heat and cheap bourbon flavors so subtle that you'll wonder if your taste buds are working. 

The ending contains a disappointing *poof* of char that just tastes like a tiny bitter ash floating up from the ethanol, along with a minuscule amount of sweetness and accompanied by a sad trombone. If this was supposed to be the ""black"" part, then it is akin to a single dead dove being shot out of a wedding cake; the presence of it is entirely expected based on the labeling, but the delivery is so anticlimactic (and in such shockingly poor taste) that you feel like it would have been better to just leave it out entirely."

Drinkable but not remarkable.  Average."

This CRB seems to have decent reviews and a buddy of mine picked up a bottle so I scored a 100ml from him for review. Poured neat, color looks good enough. Nose is....uh oh where's the nose.......damn canucks. I get some faint spice, a touch of candied corn/maple maybe some distant wood. Kinda smells like ginger ale soaked into a cardboard box. Palate however redeems somewhat. Good flavor delivery of sweet ginger , maple syrup and light toasty oak. Its easy and smooth without the notes of vodka grain swill like many ive had. Finish is flat cola and bitter wood with trailing spice. Overall its a friendly mild dram that is more suited for whiskey novices and mixing. Would I pick up a bottle for myself?......Hell no, but I can see the appeal of Crown with the image and fancy purple bag and such. I will say its the best from Canada Ive had..........68/100.........unfortunately that's not sayin much.

On the nose, it is not that strong, and it is hard to nose it really. Brown sugar notes, maple syrup (same in every canadian whisky ever lol) and some citrus note, like lemon or prune peel. 

On the Palate, starts with caramel for just a moment, then a spice bomb. Lots of spices, with a hot wood flavor and some orange notes. Very spicy. Medium bodied, but gets you mouth full of flavor. Not that pleasant though. Finish is medium, with the same profile.

A little harsh, liked the color, i am not fond with the whole profile on this one, but i got to say it is not a bad dram at all. 68 out of 100."
