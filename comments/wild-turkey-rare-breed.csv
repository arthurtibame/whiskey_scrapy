2.25,"Nose is nutty, almonds with a toasted oak.  Tasting the palate starts with a domination of rose and clove mixed in with a bitey rye spice.  The bourbon finishes with an overwhelming corn presence that skirts on the realm of flintstones vitamins.  This just does not do it for me."

2.25,"Boy this gets a lot of love here so I guess Im gonna be ""that guy"".  Im a big fan of WT products so had to try this. 112.8 proof vintage. Poured neat, has that wonderful Turkey nose of dark caramel and dusty spice, with amped up ethanol. Rich, powerful palate of caramel, strong pepper and spicy oak with char. Finishes with more pepper and cinnamon oaky char. This is the family recipe brought up several notches with some heat. The extra proof delivers very strong flavor and this stands up to other barrel proof bourbon. Not all good however for me. I find the heat and pepper spice a bit excessive and think it takes away from the delicious WT taste. Tried adding water but still too peppery. Maybe I got a bad bottle but I much prefer the flavor of Russell Reserve 10 yr or WT 101 over this and would not re-purchase..........74/100........ Im in the minority here so your mileage may vary."

3.5,"BACKGROUND: Rare Breed is a barrel proof offering from Wild Turkey, and the batch I sampled carries a proof of 116.8.  Though the label carries no age statement, the distillery has often said it is a blend of six, eight, and twelve-year bourbon.

Rare Breed was first offered in 1991, and it is interesting to note that all of Wild Turkey’s various products use the exact same mash bill of 75% corn, 13% rye, and 12% barley.  Any differences in taste from one offering within the brand to the next are the result of length of aging, placement in rick house, blending, and other varying factors.

Wild Turkey Master Distiller Jimmy Russell has said that Rare Breed is one of two products by the company that he drinks most often - the other is Russell’s Reserve 10-year.  Because he likes to drink it cold but prefers to avoid the dilution that results from melted ice, Russell famously keeps his bottle of Rare Breed in his home freezer.

NOSE: The nose offers loads of popcorn, caramel, and sweet pipe tobacco, but there is little ethanol sting for a barrel proof bourbon.  Unlike a lot of bourbons that require you to concentrate and search for the notes in the nose, the popcorn, caramel, and tobacco are quite obvious and jump out at you.

PALATE: The palate offers an abundance of cherry and butterscotch - not caramel or vanilla like may bourbons, but rather a full flavor of butterscotch.  A good bit of pepper and some oak offer a firm balance to the sweetness.

FINISH: The finish is a long one and just keeps going like the embers of a fire that will not go out.  The cherry and pepper on the palate become pepper and mint on the finish.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: At roughly $45 dollar and with ample availability in any whiskey retailer you enter, Rare Breed has long been considered a treasure among barrel proof aficionados.  After sampling the product, I can understand why.

In the future, I would be interested to test how a bit of water would change the profile of this bourbon, or, perhaps, I will just throw the bottle in my freezer and trying drinking it just like ol’ Jimmy Russell does."

4.5,The bottle I had was amazing
2.75,I'm the rare bird that doesn't find this to be very good.  Very choppy flavor delivery and too much old oak taste.

4.5,Wow!  This is good. My kind of whiskey. This has the leather and must that I like. Balanced just right for me. My current favorite.
2.5,"Took it over ice this time. The first sips were incredible, but the more it sat and the ice melted, the less special it got. There might be something to the whole freezer thing after all."

3.25,This time added a couple drops of H2O.  Opened up the nose.  Get more of a tobacco and spice smell than with the neat pour.  Enjoyed the taste of the neat pour more however the spice does come out more.
