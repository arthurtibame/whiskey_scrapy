5.0,"The nose is musky earthy with dried fruit. As for taste, as a newer scotch drinker, I’m frequently overwhelmed by the initial bitterness. It took several sips to get to all the flavors but this one is complex. Initially the flavor is earthy, woody, maybe vegetal. Then some of that dried fruit and some salty chocolate and baking spices. Midway through there was a hint of that mustiness again. Not much mouth feel but it has nice finish: bittersweet with some nutty flavors. I would enjoy owning a bottle."

3.75,So weird to see the difference from the reviewers ratings compared to AMANDA SCHUSTER the professional taster. She rates this one @ 76 while I and most reviewers are in the 87-91 region. I don't quite understand that but possibly due to many factors!
2.75,Grassy. Dry. Long spicy finish
