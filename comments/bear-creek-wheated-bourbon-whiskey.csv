3.75,"Super smooth and light , very approachable. Same proof as their other whiskies but I don't taste any burn at all. Light vanilla and wheat flavors. Good, but I'd pick up their wheat whiskey before this one."
3.5,"Appearance: A mid-range amber color is what I perceive in this craft bourbon, as well as medium-sized oily legs begrudgingly making their way back down the glass.

Nose: The nose starts off as yeasty bread and fermentation, like the inside of a brewery. Notes of wheat and dusty grain transition from there, followed by fruity strawberry Twizzler candy, red apple, cherry, floral honeysuckle, dandelion and arugula lettuce greens, as well as a maltiness, and an unfortunate astringent house cleaner note.

Taste: The palate has a citrusy orange and grapefruit tang, followed by sweet notes of vanilla and caramel, then a bitter herbal note that sweetens into the finish.

Finish: The long sweet honeyed finish is nice and really invites you into another sip.

Thoughts: With this bourbon, I was overall quite impressed. It was unique yet familiar, as far as nosing and tasting. I would recommend it and wouldn’t mind getting it again. Thanks, Bear Creek! Cheers!"
