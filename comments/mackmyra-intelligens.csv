3.75,"The nose and palate reminds me a lot of Mackmyra Svensk ek - a hint of vanilla and some green grass are the tastes that stand out the most to me. However, the finish is the most spicy I have ever had in a whisky. The strong taste of black pepper lingers for a long while after you took the last sip. There is no peat at all, but the strong spice-cocktail might be confused with a peaty finish. I would not prioritize to buy this bottle again when it’s empty, but if I find it cheap or have some extra cash I might buy another one just for the special taste and story behind it."
