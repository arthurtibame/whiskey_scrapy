I overpaid for this bottle, but I have a soft spot for Craigellachie.  The original bottling of entry level Craigellachie is also a 13 year old.  It can be found for less than 60 USD, and is much better than this.

Having said that, this is an interesting bottle that I don’t regret purchasing.  This is an austere, brooding, complex whisky.  It is well crafted and full of nuances, but I found it hard to go back to this, like I would find it hard to re-watch a movie like Manchester by the Sea.  It took well over a year to finish this bottle, and it was pretty depressing every time.

The bright fruits of Craigellachie are still present, but smothered by a sourdough maltiness and the bitterness of oak and lemon skin.  The palate is highlighted by a delayed development of Lapsong Suchong tea.  This is one of the best examples of this note in a whisky that I’ve experienced thus far.  I am Chinese, and I can tell you that most whisky reviewers who conjure “Lapsong Suchong” in a tasting note do not know what the hell they are talking about.  Smoked Chinese black tea is an acquired taste.  Gourmet tea drinkers who like to steep their single serve packs with hibiscus petals best stay away.  This unwelcoming note lingers into the finish, which also features hints of orange peel and star anise.  This is like a traditional Chinese whisky: not sweet at all, meaty, herbal bitterness, and slightly smoky.

You have to be in the right mood for this whisky.  It’s not a pick-me-up; it’s not a drown-your-sorrows; it’s not a celebration.  This is a whisky for ascetic meditation.
