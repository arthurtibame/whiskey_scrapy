5.0,"I picked this up at Gatwick Airport at World of Whiskies. Rosie straw color. Heavy smoke and barbecue on the nose. Very reminiscent of an Ardbeg Uigeadail, but bigger, or perhaps one of their Octomore whiskies. I feel the cognac barrels add some roundness to the peat note. I'm not picking up true fruit notes but maybe that is the barbecue I'm picking up. Although there is no age statement, the legs seem to indicate at least some age on it. Sweet smoke on the tongue at first, followed by big tobacco notes. A big long finish. Definitely benefits from the extra alcohol content. Doesn't benefit from the water at least for me. It was worth 100 bucks, and worth the premium over the Uigeadail. It's an outstanding Islay product."

4.0,"A great addition to have for your palate. This 8-year old heavily peated Scotch is finished in Cognac barrels and that French oak is something quite apparent, especially in the finish. It is well balanced with tones of peat, leather, hazelnuts and a touch of citrus. 

Possible to drink neat, add a dash of water and you'll have a myriad of angles to discover in this. Can be heavy on the oak for some. Well worth the price."

4.0,This is a travel exclusive and I had to hunt this down. It is really interesting. I am not a huge peat fan but the cognac cask really offsets the peat. There are a lot of good things going on when you take a sip. It's like there is a party on my palate and EVERYONE is invited. I am still trying to figure out exactly how I feel about this but I enjoy drinking it and I will continue to do so...

Decent"
1.5,"Very peety, smokey, strong nose"
4.75,"Peat and smoke up front, smooths out with citrus, clove, vanilla, and brine. It feels fresh at the end."
1.75,"Very strong, chemically, high proof. Strong but not aggressive. I don't like it but everyone else does. Need to come back to this one when I have more experience with peaty whiskeys."

4.0,Nice. Peaty start to finish. Smooth full complex flavors
4.0,"A battle between Cognac and pure Islay peat smoke. The nose hints at promises of smoke and vanilla and spice and on the tongue its a scrum.  It's like there is a party in your mouth and everyone is invited. The abv is cask strength but there is no alcohol burn or harshness which is surprising for an 8 year old. However, the abv makes its presence felt soon enough. This is some powerful whisky. It takes water really well, mellowing the smoke and opening up new flavors of butterscotch and nuts. This is a complex and powerful dram. I like it."
