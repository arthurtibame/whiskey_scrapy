4.75,7/2/19 - A birthday dram from Lena.🏆
5.0,Easily the finest dram I have ever tasted.
5.0,"I kept my ""impressive Whisky Reviews from Scotland"" for last, and i have finally taken some time to write about them. I started with the Dalmore 25yo and now i will talk about this beautiful Glenfiddich 30yo. There has been a lot of different Expressions of Glenfiddich 30yo, this one is the 40%abv, old bottle, the one with the triple XXX in the lower label. 

I also had this one at the great ""The Grill"" bar in Aberdeen. I really didn't know what to expect since the 18yo Glenfiddich felt ""too fancy"" to be any good; the 21yo is a different ""animal"" since it is matured in reserva rum casks; and the Snow Phoenix was superb but still lacked something. 

Well, lets talk about this 30yo. 

On the nose it is amazingly complex and great. Very old, thick caramel. Actually peaty! Heathery/smoky. I believe they used some peat 30 or more years ago, and that was something more normal back then; nowadays they use unpeated barley for every expression.

Lots of chocolate coming. Coffee; Red fruits that feels like old, Cherries. 
Lemon, Nice baked apples, Everything feels sweet but old. 

Smells just like the caramel that comes out of the cask and naturally seals them.
Very complex. Oranges. After first sip vanilla just came out. Very refined.

AND THAT IS ONLY THE NOSE. 

On the palate, it is not as complex, still very good, not perfect. Super smooth. Oranges right away. There is oak spice very dim and pleasant. After 10 seconds in the mouth some sider/apple flavor comes along. Vanilla very watered flavor also present.

Aftertaste is lovely: smoky, oaky, old books, tobacco, super pleasant. 

Its like everything has been tuned down for you to enjoy it. Balance is the key here. Wonderful dram. Even for a super fancy flavor, it is fruity and enjoyable. No alcohol or burn whatsoever. Great whisky, expensive, 98/100. Sláinte!"
