5.0,Heavy molasses raisin on the nose. Smooth and spicy like a strong port.
4.25,"Rich caramel and oak on the nose. Can’t see much of the port on the nose but on the palate, the wine influence is there. It’s got a slight jammy fruitiness that rounds out some of the harsher notes. Some nice cinnamon spice in the midpalate and...it’s tannic if you can believe that. The corn mustiness and sawdust is more subdued in this guy, yielding to the port. It’s sweet, spicy, thick and rich. I like it a good bit more than the small batch and single barrel, but not near as much as Balmorhea or the BPs I’ve had, so 4.25 is fair. Great with a few minutes of undisturbed oxidation before sipping."
4.5,"N: Sweet vanilla and lemon. Almost like a Lemonhead candy.
P: Sweet citrus candy continues, viscous maple and fig on the mid-palate
F: Sweet port wine finish. Long bit only a bump of heat"
4.0,"N: Sweet vanilla with a hint of red fruit 
P: Carrots with brown sugar 
F: Big dry Texas oak that lingers on the tongue for a long tim"

3.75,"Port-finished version of Garrison Brothers. Not bad, and I typically don’t even like port finishes."
