3.5,"Orange marmalade, sherry, with a little lemon pledge and oak on the nose, oily, creamy with slightly spicy orange on the palate, the finish is medium length and slightly spicy"
3.0,"solid Sherry finished scotch. Nose: sweet, candied nuts, sweet dried fruit mostly dates for me. Taste: sweet on the front with Sherry dark fruit, some vanilla and grass. ends with just a bit of ginger spice and goes away fast. easy to drink. I love Balvenie DW, but for 1/2 the price this would be a easy alternaive."
3.0,Good weeknight dram. The sherry speaks to me. Really good scotch for the money.

1.5,"Nose: citrus, American oak
Taste: no sherry sweetness, oak, young, little hot
Finish: same as taste, short"
3.25,I prefer Islay normally so find this a little boring. I actually get a lot of orange? Is that usual in the fruity sherried whiskies? I’m trying to get past it but that’s most of what I’m getting. This is smooth and easy drinking but I’m normally drinking something like a Cask Strength Laphroaig (or even a normal one) so at 40% surely it’s going to be easier than that.
3.25,Very mellow and smooth.
3.5,"Nose: Sweet. Fruit.
Palate: Sweet, full, a little salty
Finish: Short

Decent for the price, but not much more."

2.75,"Got some of the vanilla from the oak that I assume was used before the sherry casks on the nose along with slight sherry and medicinal notes. 

Taste was about the same as the nose. Cigar flavor lingers after some time. Taste doesn’t last very long. 

Ok scotch but wouldn’t purchase a full bottle."

3.0,The whole grangestone line is a great introductory lineup for highland scotch. This might be the best of the alternative cask finishes.

3.5,It wasn’t bad. The sherry cask gives it a bit of an overpowering taste. Kinda has a smoky taste but with a tiny bit of water it subdued that sherry/smoky taste and made it better.

3.0,I’m not mad at it. Just not a fan hopefully it’s the neck pour that make me feel that way.
3.5,"This whisky is hard to find.... on the internet. 

Actually they sell this one in any total wine in USA and they offer tastings of it inside the store, but it doesn't seem to be anywhere online to even get a picture of it, or any other of their expressions. 

Talking about the whisky itself this one was a fruity fellow, who had a very bizarre finish.

On the nose: Lemon; very Fruity, Citric, grapefruit, lemon pie, apples,  currant, green mango. Stinky and fruity.

On the palate it has a very marked fresh fruit profile. Apples, pears, cereal with honey and a slight vanilla. 

Aftertaste is strange. Short finish, very fruity; There is something odd no bad, but not typical Like iron. 

Overall this is a whisky that HAS NO SHERRY INFLUENCE IN IT despite been a sherry cask finish. Boring and a little normal, you could use it instead of drinking juice, i guess. 72/100"
