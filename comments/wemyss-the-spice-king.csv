3.5,"The spice king is part of the Wemyss malts, which are easy drinkable whiskies. They have the honeyed one, the peaty one, the highland / balanced one; and this Spice King. Is it good? Lets find out.

Bottled at 46%abv. 

On the nose everything starts nice. Brown cake, dark fruits, christmas cake, a dim red wine note and cinnamon. 

On the palate is where everything starts fading. There are smoke, ashes and raisins notes, not in a balanced way. 

Aftertaste is too harsh, oaky and peaty but unbalanced and a little unpleasant. 

Overall this is a dram that definitively could be better, specially in the aftertaste. 72 over 100."

Taste: slightly astringent, green apples, peaty finish. I prefer the nose."
