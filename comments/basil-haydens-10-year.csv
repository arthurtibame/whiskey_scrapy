4.0,Even flavor. Usual Basil Hayden / Beam profile. Nice rich honey finish.
2.0,Maybe I am used to higher proof whiskey but this taste like I would imagine a puddle full of wood chips would taste like.
4.5,Very smooth
3.5,"Spice, oak and light vanilla with very slight hint of smoke on the nose. Smooth, creamy with the spice and oak giving way to the vanilla with hint banana bread on the taste. Nice, easy sipping."

4.0,"fruity, light, pepper, oak"
4.0,"Nose:  Rich, chocolate orange, oak, vanilla w/ anise and a hint of clove.
Palate:  Soft and creamy mouthfeel, sweet  with vanilla, citrus spice, salted caramel and a note of mint.
Finish:  Moderately long, damp with trailing citrus notes and oak.
Comments:  In a world where lately the big limited editions are high proof, Basil Hayden stays true to its brand with an 80 proof pour that delivers a lot of flavor – while maintaining the subtle/nuance that the brand is known for.  Basil Hayden was 8 year age stated originally, having lost that a few years back – but this shows how lovely the whiskey can be with a few extra years in the barrel.  It is Basil Hayden with the volume turned up (not ‘cranked up, break the knob off’, but definitely a step or two up).  The citrus notes (very ‘rye-like’, which isn’t a surprise given the high-rye mashbill) are familiar, but the chocolate was a nice touch that I don’t usually get with Basil Hayden.  I can’t find anything here which would leave fans of Basil Hayden disappointed, and a fair amount that I think they’re really enjoy."

2.0,If you’re an experienced whiskey drinker I wouldn’t bother. Nothing special. Rather bland and has the shortest finish for a 10 year old. Maybe more than 40% alcohol would help?  It got more bland as the fill went down. Seemed more like flavored water with alcohol added. Having said that. It would be a great introduction to a non whiskey drinker. Not challenging at all. At this price point I will not recommend.
4.5,Fantastic 🥃

2.5,Way too weak and bland.
3.0,"N: light vanilla and spice, oaky

P: Baking Spices, Vanilla, Balanced and not hot

F: feels short, smooth, with spices and caramel

Given the mixed reviews was unsure what to expect. Not a mind blowing experience but not underwhelming. I got what I expected from BH. Would not pay more than standard MSRP. Would definitely not pay more than 55-60 for this. Sorry Parker ☹️"
4.5,Rich and spicy with a delicate long lingering finish. Vanilla and oak front with some peppery spice.

2.5,"Disclaimer: I came into this drink as a Basil Hayden’s hater.

I get pear cider on the nose. Body delivers on the cider flavor without the sweetness. Very dry mouth feel with a very short, minty finish.

It’s a one-trick-pony, and unfortunately, I’m not a big fan of the trick. The pear cider flavor is artificial and industrial, not tart, sweet, nor fresh. I prefer this to standard Basil Hayden’s, but there’s just too many better things out there to justify this purchase again in the future."

3.5,"Initial scent is citrus and a wee bit of chocolate coated in the familiar vanilla and oak. The first bit of flavor is familiar Basil Hayden's, with the rye making a tiny appearance, and then quickly the flavor continues to mellow out into delicious wood notes. If you keep your mouth closed, that higher age keeps that wood taste all the way through to the finish. If, however, you decide to breathe it all in, the bright rye hitches a ride with grain, citrus, and floral notes alongside the road of aged oak."

3.75,"Ten years doesn’t do a whole lot for Basil Hayden. Stick with Knob Creek, Bakers or Bookers for a superior bourbon experience at the same price or even cheaper in some cases. 

Nose: standard Jim Beam aroma including corn, brown sugar, hints of oak and mint

Taste: front of the palate is almost scotch-like, but gives way to a little vanilla and caramel and baking spices 

Finish: short, with a little more rye spice 

Before the bourbon craze this was about how good standard Jim Beam tasted. Now with the depleted stocks that old flavor profile has jumped to $60+ a bottle. Is it worth it? No way."

3.75,"Very smooth bourbon because of the low proof. Definitely some different tasting notes compared to the standard Basil Hayden’s due to the extra age, but would benefit from a higher proof. A worthwhile purchase for the right price (mine was a steal for $46), but if you see it for $70+ I would pass. There are much better bourbons in that price range."

2.75,"Nose: Quite a bit of ethanol punch for a 40 proof whiskey.  Oak abound with some background notes of vanilla and citrus peel.  Not super complex but nice smelling.

Flavor: Just like the nose but VERY sweet.  Vanilla, oak, and a little bit of citrus peel here as well.  Quite a bit of alcohol burn for the 80 proof.  I don't think the 10 years in a barrel have done this whiskey any favors.

Finish:  Fairly short with a good bit of barrel bitter that I found a little off putting and a hint of rye spice.

This whiskey is ok but nothing exciting.  Maybe a higher proof would have brought out more of the flavor?  It seems a waste to age something 10 years only to mute the flavors by bottling at a lower proof.  If Basil Hayden's ever has a barrel proof release I'm all over it."
