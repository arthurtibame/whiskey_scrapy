3.25,"Kind of a raw sweetish alcohol smell almost like a young brandy, but a fairly smooth taste that sort of reminds me of Irish pot still whiskey - malty flavors of light sherry and wood resin, with a slightly warming finish. Just a bit of brine and smoke - a bit of a coastal feel. Simple but enjoyable."
