3.5,"This was another limited edition from last year, available at the Tobermory distillery and online. It spent its last two years in hogsheads that previously held Rioja wine, implying it was in ex-bourbon casks previously. The nose is sharp peat with a hint of something sweet underneath. Some heathery elements emerge with time. It’s better diluted to 50%, which brings out minty and meaty notes. The palate, like many of the older Ledaigs, is overwhelmed by the peat - it kicks in too soon and too strong. But tame it with water and you’ll find flavors of raspberry amid the spice and a long oily finish with the savoriness of cranberry. Peat and red wine can be a difficult combination and the balance isn’t quite right here. Still, worth trying for the fruity notes and I’m glad I have a second sample for further titration experiments."
