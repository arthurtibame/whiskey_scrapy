4.75,"Finished in Bordeaux wine barrels.  The wine finish is well balanced on the nose, and complements the Bourbon.  The palate follows through with the nose, with the wine cask intertwined and balanced harmoniously with the Bourbon.  Easily the finest Bourbon that's been finished that I've had!!  At $130 it's hard to call this a bargain, but have tried many costing much more that were not of this quality.  My score was 95.5"

3.5,"Jefferson's is one of the most polarizing non distilling producer (NDP the equivalent of an IB with Scotch) and for good reason. They are less than transparent with the source and age of their distillate. They typically rely heavily on marketing and have very mixed reviews on their offerings. Whether it's the wildly popular Oceans series and the debate on whether thats a gimmick or it actually impacts the Bourbon or their various other offerings you will get a lot of varying opinions. So here we have a premium offering from Jefferson's that's finished in wine casks from a famed winery (and I love a good Bordeaux). Other than that we have no details (and no reviews to boot). So how does this one taste? Let's dive in...

It's got a soft but rich entry... Vanilla, tobacco and berries upfront with mature oak in the background... clove and cinnamon pick up on the mid palate with some honey... The finish is all Bordeaux oak intermingled with baking spices... Dense red fruit notes as well.... It's all in wonderful balance... Finish is very long... Literally 10 mins after a sip your tongue is still tingling... Lovely!

If you are a fan of Bordeaux style wine than I would highly recommend this Bourbon. I feel that to fully appreciate this Whiskey one must have experience with both a mature Bourbon and a fine Bordeaux, otherwise this will feel underwhelming. Cheers All!"
