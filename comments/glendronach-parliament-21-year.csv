The sherry influence, oak sawdust, dried fruits, spiciness, vanilla, some nuttiness going on, flashes of dark cocoa, and it just keeps going.  Full bodied and sticky, almost like a syrup.  Finish drops off abruptly at first, but it only falls so far, then it lingers a nice, long time.  An outstanding whisky if you're into sherried Scotch!"

5.0,"This reminded me of those car ads on tv for the so-called BMW killers.   I drive a BMW , and I have driven the ""BMW killers' like Acura TL, Infiniti G.  They definitely had more horsepower, luxury, technology and overall better value for your money than the BMW.  But  they seemed to have lacked that certain "" je ne sais quoi"".   Can't place a finger on it, but they didn't evoke the visceral excitement as the BMW.  The same metaphor can be applied here with Glendronach 21 Parliament against the Macallan 21.  This is definately better quality, smoother, and so much better value.  In a blind taste test, I would've chosen this over the Macallan 21 ( at least those from this decade).  But for some reason, it doesn't have that regal feeling as a Macallan.  Personally...id go for this over the Macallan 21 any day of the week..."

4.0,"This was muted at first. Though it was worth waiting for it to open up. Syrup, raisins, and sandalwood, though this is clouded a bit by alcohol. The palate is the real stunner. Very silky with tobacco throughout, dried fruits, leather, nutty nougat, powerful wood spices, and a little waft of smoke. You'll find the finish goes on for quite a while, making this a great leisurely sipper.

This whisky does a nice job displaying its sherry influence while still leaving room for the spirit to shine. If the aroma had a little more clarity and power this would be a giant in the pantheon of sherried whiskies. That said this is still quite a contender."
5.0,"On the nose heavy Sherry, Dark Chocolate, Walnut, Spice, Mexican Vanilla, Mexican Cinnamon, nutmeg, espresso.
On the palate: Chocolate Cake, Wedding cookies, Coffee, full mouth coating and very long lasting. Complex Dram to be nosed and enjoyed for at least an hour. No burn or spice on the finish. No water or ice recommended. One of my new favorites only after the Macallan 18."

5.0,"Very enjoyable whiskey as most of the Glendronachs are but is it worth the 50% price premium over the 15 or 18 yr. No. Higher abv shows through combined with a general lovely sherry flavour but for me its younger brothers win the day so far. This was based on a 50ml mini bottle though so maybe once I open the big bottle I have and let it sit for a number of months my assessment may change. Update. Ok retasted against Bunnahabhain 18, Glen Balcalta and if they are a four I have to rate a 5 despite the price premium. It is a very good whisky"

It's a pleasing rosewood color, to be sure, and the nose is an appealing mix of beeswax and marmalade. But undiluted it's all over the place on the palate and only a little more focused with water.

5.0,"Nose - (w/o water) Initially very hot but tames with about 15 mins of air time, dark vanilla toffee, leather, dark chocolate, syrupy dried dark stone fruits (w/ water) exponentially less heat, more mellow toffee, addition of dark cherries to nose.

Taste - (w/o water) Chewy, oily mouthfeel, white pepper tingle, dark chocolate covered syrupy dried dark stone fruits, ginger, orange zest (w/o water) heat is all but gone, more milk chocolate, very fruity still, orange zest more prominent, dried dark fruits, dried berries.

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering dark chocolate covered fruit, ginger spice, fruity sweet, light bitter berry fruit (w/ water) less spice tingle, more balanced fruity chocolaty sweet

Score - 93/100

Final Thoughts - This was initially super hot on the nose but after a bit of air time it tamed quite a bit. Once it does though, it does have a great nose, albeit a tiny bit one dimensional with chocolate covered dark fruits w/ a hint of toffee, but it's great. Oddly enough, this is only 48% but I find that it's a bit hot at that proof and it takes a tiny bit of water wonderfully. A tiny bit of water opens everything up, eliminates the burn and the flavors seem a lot more balanced and just pop out more. This is a fantastic dram when you want something desserty or a nice sherry bomb.

Would I specifically order it? - Yes

5.0,"In contrast to the Allardice, Parliament adds in some PX sherry influence into the mix of casks that compose this venerable whisky.  This whisky is pure, dense, rich fruitcake, raisins or dates, and sticky, caramelized fruit.  The finish features that smoke again, but with an added bitterness that bears a startling resemblance to black coffee.  At $200, I would recommend grabbing the Allardice at the moment, particularly due to the fact that it too is a 21-year old whisky masquerading as a younger one (see my note on GlenDronach 18; basic idea is that it comes from pre-1996 distillate, when the distillery shut down for a while, so Allardice right now is actually older than its age statement).  Nonetheless, this is another cracker of a dram from GlenDronach."

The palate is outstanding on its own without water. White pepper, brown sugar, raspberries, cashews and dates. The finish is long and brings out more peppers, darker chocolate, and slight oak. This one needs a sweet and complex song for its theme. I'll pick ""My Ashes"" by Porcupine Tree. 4.75! Thanks for the pour @Generously_Paul!"

3.0,"Slightly akin to The Macallan rare cask, this is a sherry bomb.  Unfortunately the taste and smell is like you are immersing yourself in a humidor.   Tobacco notes are very forward.  Too Sherry forward."
3.5,"Nose: Sherry soaked pipe tobacco with a golden-syrup background. A waft of citrus. A fleeting hint of oak cask and black coffee.

Palate: Winey syrup turning spicy-dry in the arrival. The development brings out cloves and dry, woody sherry notes. A little earthy and leathery, with sherry-soaked raisins and cherries. A touch of star anise and quite a lot of astringency on the back of the tongue.

Finish: Medium-short. Dark chocolate, licorice, tannin. A smoky hint around the edges, but it's almost certainly just barrel-char from the long maturation.

This whisky, whilst certainly very smooth, mellow and well balanced, seemed oddly washed-out to me.  Tasting it was like viewing a beautiful but faded tapestry that I knew would have been stunningly vibrant 300 years ago.  There was nothing I actively disliked, but so much seemed to be lacking.  Rather than majestic and mature it was just old and tired.

This costs $225-285 in Australia and for that money I'd rather buy three bottles of the excellent GlenDronach 12 year old, or better yet a bottle of the stunning GlenDronach Allardice 18 for about 2/3 the price.

5.0,"Checking my notes and it’s been 3 weeks since my last review. A combination of weddings, family events, a cold and trying to work through some of my open bottles sidelined me. Plus ever since the SDT ended I just don’t feel the pressure to pound out samples 4-5 nights a week. Anyways, on to the whisky du jour. GlenDronach Parliament 21 year old. Why it’s called Parliament I have no idea, and honestly I don’t care, because it’s wonderful. Matured in a combination of PX and Oloroso sherry casks, bottled at the 48% ABV sweet spot, non chill filtered and natural color of a nice mahogany. 

The nose is all sweet savory sherry with soft sherried fruits. Berries, plums, dates, apricots and raisins. Oranges dusted with cocoa powder, pecans, Brazil nuts and cola. Warm pecan pie, nutmeg, ginger and allspice. There was a note of something like citronella or furniture polish, but it was brief and not really a bad thing when it was there. Some light oak, pancake syrup, chocolate pudding, chocolate licorice (yes those are two distinct chocolate smells), and vanilla. 
As an experiment I added a bit of water even though I don’t think any was needed. Everything was softened and nothing additional was brought out except a little more oak, hazelnuts and a bit of a soapy note. 

The palate starts with gentle baking spices at first, then they build in intensity and the signature GlenDronach spice profile is revealed. A bit earthy with mild ginger root, nutmeg and allspice. Nutty sherry - walnuts, pecans and hazelnut. Polished oak with some slightly bitter tannins. Raisins, dates and some bitter dark chocolate. 
Water does very little except bring down some of the bitterness (even though there wasn’t much there to begin with). 

A medium bodied mouthfeel that is creamy and silky smooth. 
The finish is medium length with sherry, chocolate, nutty with some tannins. 

This is a wonderfully matured highland single malt. A very elegant yet easily approachable profile. Both the PX and Oloroso casks show their influence here. This is every bit as good as the 18 year old, but not so good that it justifies the much higher price tag. Speaking of price, here in Michigan this bottle goes for a whopping $250. At that price there is no way I would have bought a bottle. Instead I got this from Master of Malt for $117, plus shipping. True it was only a 700mL bottle vs the 750 I would have gotten here in the States, but those 50 extra mL’s are not worth the extra $100 or so. I won’t be restocking this bottle as I have so many more to get to, but I recommend it to sherry lovers out there. 4.5
Cheers"

4.25,"The smell is invaded by the liqueur sherry, with a background of licorice and rhubarb. Dried figs, raisins, milk chocolate... the nose sinks into a sea of elegant sweetness, full-bodied and structured. In the long run, it gives off a persuasive aroma of wood.
And it is precisely the wood that makes itself felt first on the palate, leaving a trail as it flows over the tongue, almost immediately dominated by the sherried and vinous notes, always with a hint of rhubarb to soften its sweetness. Chili and almonds are added to the company, with the chocolate going dark, and still dried fruit. A touch of amaretto and cinnamon. Far from a simple drink, the tasting deserves time and attention to grasp its nuances, it is certainly not what is called a daily dram.
The finish is not very long, made of wood, spices, dried fruit."

In the meantime, I picked this up today, and when I popped the cork, it was moldy. The juice seems unaffected, and luckily I had an old GlenDronach cork that I swapped it out with (always save your corks folks!). Seems like the bottle sat in the back room at Total Wine for a while (2017 bottling), and some condensation built up. Anybody else had this happen before?"

Underwhelming. Quite a surprise... the 12, 15 and 18 rock. This is quite one dimensional. It’s all sherry, and nothing else. Raisins dominate throughout everything, and especially at this price, this disappoints me.

5.0,"Hail to the new king!

This is now my favorite scotch of all time. From the moment it is poured into the glencairn this incredible aroma gets into your nose and you know you are about to experience something amazing.

I think is safe to say that Glendronach is one of the top 3 or at least top 5 best whisky distilleries, everything they do is great and 2 out of my 3 favorite whiskies are from them. 

This expression is called ""Parliament"", and it has nothing to do with politics or government. Actually ""parliament"" is an english word for ""a group of owls"" which happen to be something common near glendronach distillery. It seems like the owls live near the distillery and when tourists come near they just fly away and then they return after the visitors are gone.

Bottled at 48%abv, the most beautiful mahogany color. 

On the nose, it was fantastic. Coffee, Tiramisu, Walnut, hazelnut, Incredible sherry, maraschino cherries, Milk powder, Dulce de leche ice cream, Orange liquor and Chocolate notes. Cocoa butter after first sip, and then lots of chocolate. Amazing. 

On the palate, it is a spicy little fellow. Instant cherry flavor but then a spicy explosion, but super pleasant, black pepper, oak spice, sherry. Sweet but not too sweet, bitter chocolate. Tiramisú, hazelnut, cocoa butter, maraschino cherry syrup. Lots of delicious stuff going on. 

Aftertaste is WONDERFUL. A puff of smoke from burnt hay, incredibly long, with ginger and allspice. Just marvelous.

Letting it breath will release chocolate with caramel with bitter herbal notes to the palate. 

Overall, hands down this is my favorite dram from 2018, and it is now my new favorite whisky. I score it 110 out of 100. Slainte Mhath, friends!"

4.25,Bitter dark chocolate and black coffee and truffles on the nose. Palate is fruity with a bit baking spice and vanilla. Reminds me of a caramel fruit candy with a bit of earthiness on the back. Excellent
4.5,The closest I’ve had to a dessert whiskey

5.0,"Mother of God.

I'd wager that for most of our whisky drinking experience, we come across pours where we think, ""Oh, that's nice. I might buy a bottle"" or ""That was ok, but I'll skip a purchase"" or maybe even ""Holy shit, that's awful. Who made this?!"", but rarely am I left dumbfounded at how mesmerizing something is that makes time stand still and all I can think of is ""Mother of God..."".

It's no secret that I'm a Glendronach fanboy. I continue to hunt down their various expressions like a kid completing his set of baseball cards. I like the integrity of their bottlings, the distillery character (and characters...), and the commitment to exclusive sherry maturation. Each successive expression I've tried has something wonderful to offer, which culminates in this 21 (ish) year old masterpiece.

Back in the 80's when Transformers was still a new thing, there were a set of robots that each had their own powers, but they were also able to combine to form a super-Autobot of sorts to create a hero that was greater than the sum of their parts. My experience with this whisky was the same. I get the robust quality of the GD spirit from the 8 year old Hielen, the youthful exuberance and approachability of the 12 year old Original, the spicy, sticky Christmasy quality of the new 15 year Revival (the Revival Revival?), the penetrating, old oak of the 18 year Allardice. Somehow, inexplicably, these flavors happen all at once in the 21 year; a sum of the best of GD's other core offerings, culminating in an experience that can only lead to me expressing ""Mother of God..."".

I'll go easy on the tasting notes. This one is best experienced for yourself. I may have overpaid for this, but I'm not concerned at this point. This is far and away the best whisky on my shelf, and quite honestly, the price point stands up when you compare it to other popular 21 year olds (cough, Macallan, cough, Balvenie). 

Pull the trigger and see for yourself, and yes, I think this is better than the ""old"" 18 year bottlings, which to be fair, are fantastic in their own right (gave it a 4.75 myself), but this one takes the experience to a whole new level for me. Post in the comments below what whisk(e)y gave you that ""Holy shit, now this is whisk(e)y!!!"" moment in your journey, and if you haven't arrived there yet, I hope you do soon. Cheers."

4.0,"Smells like honey, syrup, maybe even chocolate. Sweet. Initial mouth is smooth and will burn you , but the burn is not unpleasant and does not last long. After taste is a hint of the same fragrance from the first nose."
