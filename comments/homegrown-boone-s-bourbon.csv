1.5,"Aroma is simple, soft and grainy in a way that’s approachable and carries a custard-like sweetness that increases alongside the young woody profile as it opens; Palate, again, is simple and fruity light with a grain dominant profile and raw wood – the two have yet to integrate; Finish is sweet and woody."
3.75,"Got this at barrel proof, 114, has a rye nose but not overpowering,  tastes sweet but not as spicy as the nose would lead me to believe,  and goes down nice and warm due to the proof.  Pretty good for a 6 month old, I'd love to try it again if they have a barrel aging longer."
