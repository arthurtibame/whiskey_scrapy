4.0,"I really wanted to like this whiskey.  I live close by, know the owners a little, and I really like the staff at the distillery.  

I'm sure it will improve with age, but the 24 month currently available is good except for a slight aftertaste I can't quite explain. I am looking forward to trying longer aged examples to see if it goes away.  

It may be something others enjoy more and I encourage you to try it out for yourselves.  I'll certainly try it again."
