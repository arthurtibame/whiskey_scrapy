4.0,I was quite surprised that I would find such a decent whisky in my own backyard. I can imagine that it's not to everyone's taste. But don't get fouled. This is a worthy bottle to have in your collection.

3.0,At 46% this is surprisingly light.  Sweet and flowery smell and same taste. Nice to have whisky from real beer mash and all in all a funny whisky making a great addition!

4.0,Sweet and vanillas on the nose. Fruits. The taste is a bitter orange peel and almost a sour beer note.

3.25,"Tried it bc a friend wanted to know about it and I'll drink almost anything...Also love their beer.

Mmmm malted honey nut cheerios. 

Light with a sweet yet spicy burn on the tongue. Definitely grainy. Not a super rough ride but the youngness is definitely present.

Nice quick burn and warm finish. Short to medium length. 

I still like their beer more but I like how the palate and finish remind me of their ales. age it longer and I can guarantee I'd give this a 4"
