3.0,Now that’s a shooting whiskey.  Flavor is right on; peach and pecan with some syrupy sweetness.  Not for sipping but good for shooting and probably makes a mean mixed drink.
4.0,"Oaky color with a hint of orange. The peach really comes through in the aroma. The peach also is the dominant flavor and slightly sweet. There are some nutty notes, but hard to identify them as pecan. Nice mouth feel. The peach really lingers. Overall pleasant. Would be really nice in the summer when you’re looking for something fruity."
3.0,Definite light peach and then the pecan. Easy sipper for sure.
