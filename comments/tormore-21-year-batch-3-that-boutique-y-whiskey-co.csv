3.5,One of 149 bottles which indicates a single cask. Now I've had a good run with TBWC lately but it tails off here a bit. You'd think if they pick one cask and charge around $150USD (700ml equiv) they'd make it a good one but I preferred the Tamnavulin DC at 1/3rd the price (and then promptly rounded that up to a 4 for VFM). Not bad with its very sweet vanilla bones but bit of an ethanolly aftertaste and not much else going on. 3.25-3.5 for me. Still Tormore distillery ticked off my list on my wander through Scotland's finest.
