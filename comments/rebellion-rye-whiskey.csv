3.0,"Hot to taste and antiseptic on the nose. Caramel, spice, and vanilla with a corn-heavy finish."
3.0,"A mash bill of 23% corn, 65% rye, and 12% malted barley. The whiskey is distilled in Indiana and bottled by Meier's Distilled Products Co. in Silverton, Ohio. It's double distilled in a copper pot still. It has amber color and a sweet smell. It's a lighter rye with spicy and sweet notes."
