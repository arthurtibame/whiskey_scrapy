4.0,"Talk about bang for your buck. I think the reviewer got this one wrong. There is a bit of alcohol on the nose and it is definitely rich and sweet, but it does not come off as overly hot to me. I think the proof is on point for this expression and I get a typical buffalo trace flavor profile with hints of cinnamon. The rim of the glass smells wonderful after it sits for a while, pleasant wood and hints of caramel."
