4.0,"I need more time with it to decide.  I find it a bit light.  Very cohesive, no off notes but it could use a higher proof and more finish.  Reminds me Russels Reserve but with more fruit.  I don't detect the smoke"
4.0,"Sweet on the nose tons of oak, vanilla and Carmel’s very inviting. Very creamy on the mouth, nice and sweet with a ton of Smokey oak on the end. You can really pick up that second filtration to add the Smokey notes. Overall for the price it’s very nice"
3.0,"I bought a bottle at the Turkey Hill Distillery shop prior to the release. In a word, it’s great. 

Medium body, about the color of honey, and nice and clear. 

Apple butter, toast, and syrup in the nose; I also noticed the mesquite used to finish the bourbon in and just a slight hint of bacon! It smells like breakfast. 

Smokey wood, oatmeal, maple syrup, and vanilla. It almost has a peated scotch kind of flavor. 

The finish maintains a strong Smokey taste and with the sweetness reminiscent of barbecue in the finish. 

This is a solid bourbon, with a character I doubt can be found in the average bottle. I’ll be keeping a bottle of this around."

4.0,"As a WT fan boy I was a bit skeptical about this whiskey but happy to say I was not disappointed. Smooth, lingering finish with typical WT spice, oak, tobacco and a nice amount of sweetness. Incredibly easy to drink while retaining the aforementioned character. Neat is the way to go with this one. Cheers!"

4.0,"Neat in a Glencairn. Nose: Cinnamon, vanilla, citrus peel, tobacco and a light floral note. The famous WT barnyard funk is there, way in the background, but only if you know to look for it. Palate: Big honey vanilla sweetness on entry that transitions quickly to a peppery mid-palate. Short, slightly drying astringent wood heavy finish. Leaves a tingly coating of citrus, mint and wood. Despite loving the Rare Breed from the get-go, WT101 was an acquired taste for me. It took several cracks at it and varying levels of dilution. Now it's one of my favorites. This I liked right from the start. Perhaps this bourbon is intended to be a gateway to WT's other bourbons for those new to whiskey. If so, I think they've hit the right notes. Where this one may struggle is price point. There is a glut of $30-$40 bourbons. When this bottle is gone, it's going to be hard for me to buy another one with curiosity no longer being a factor."

4.0,"Ever wonder what Wild Turkey would taste like if the Russell family were from Tennessee instead of Kentucky? Here’s your huckleberry, if so, because the filtration through mesquite and oak charcoal here lends a certain Daniels-and-Dickel quality here - that light, sweet, summery quality. And, really, that’s what this is at its core as a bourbon - it’s a bourbon made for a porch swing on a late July evening. The Wild Turkey house style is present - sweet corn, baking spices, a pleasantly dry woodiness, cherry cola - but lighter. That’s not to say it’s not flavorful; far from it, but it is lighter in body and lacks the crackling, hot vibrancy of most other Wild Turkey bottlings. I found this for a bit under $40; not a bad price. I wouldn’t reach for this in January when the Wisconsin winter is howling around my house, but now that the days are long and the garden is nearly prepped for planting? I’ll take it."

4.0,"Wild Turkey Longbranch
Classification: Kentucky Straight Bourbon
Proof: 86
Age: NAS (8 Years)
Mashbill: 75% corn, 13% Rye, 12% Malted Barley
Distillery: Wild Turkey Distillery, Lawrenceburg, KY
Price: $35 - $40
Color: Dark Gold
Nose: Mild aroma, light oak, cool vanilla, caramel, smallest hint of banana
Palate: Sweet, creamy, exceptionally smooth, oak, cinnamon, mild rye spice
Finish: Medium finish, dry, cinnamon and spice trails to the end, initial heat that dissipates quickly, oak
Personal Rating: 6.5/10
Notes: Alright, alright, alright folks, Longbranch is here. Surprisingly enough, I’ve seen more hate on #Longbranch in the Bourbon Community than love. However, it seems to all be geared toward the marketing and involvement with McConaughey rather than overall flavor. That being said, I don’t see a point in arguing about it, I just want to focus on the pour. Essentially what we have here is Wild Turkey’s flavor profile toned down to be more approachable for those who don’t normally drink whiskey. If that was In fact Wild Turkey’s goal, I think Loangbranch is a great success. It has many of the individual notes that the experienced drinker enjoys, but less heat and spiciness that can make some apprehensive to enjoy a whiskey. One thing that I really enjoy about this bourbon is it is more oak forward that Wild Turkey’s usual offering...I do love me some woodsy flavors. The price range is exactly what it should be as well, $35 - $40 makes this easily accessible for pretty much anyone. I think that drinking this neat is the way to go. There isn’t much in the way of heat that it needs a splash of water to open anything up and there is enough balance and complexity to make this enjoyable for seasoned veterans and newcomers alike. Grab a bottle, especially if you or someone you know is new to bourbon drinking"

2.0,"Flat out did not care for this bland, bleh of a bourbon. It tries to have some flavors, it really does, but they come off as only a weak attempt and  the aromas picked up on the nose are stronger than anything your tongue with pull out of your dram. Maybe I'm just used to bourbon that puts hair on your chest at this point (or really anything else that's halfway decent). Labeling it as a ""beginner's bourbon"" may be the only way to label it, other than ""don't buy again""."

It has a pleasant sweetness to it as well and really opens up with a few drops of water. An easy sipper that I have the pleasure to now keep in my personal stock."
3.0,"Soft, pleasant nose. A bit of must, and cardboard, caramel, and char. Smooth, this is what you want your bourbon air freshener to smell like. On the palate, baking spice, honey, orange zest. Pleasant. Good starter bourbon, but don't limit it to that. Successful collaboration in my view. 7/3/18"

4.0,This is like 101’s younger brother. It has subtle nose qualities such as the smoke. Tobacco and old leather ride just a little out in front of the smoke. Price is a relative thing. I’ve had $20 whiskey that were not worth the price. I’ve had $300 bottles that lived up to price. At less than $40 this one would be a daily driver.

3.0,"I had been very skeptical about this one, however, after reading @PBMichiganWolverine review (one of the better reviewers on this app if you have yet to read one of his reviews) I made a mental note to try a pour. Fast forward to now, they have a bottle for a $7 pour, so I thought why not. 
This is nice dram. Nothing special, just well nice. Upon entry you are get smacked in the face with vanilla and brown sugar, mid pallette has a slight spice swell that quickly moves to a medium oak driven finish. Not overly complex but you can tell is got some good age to it (8 yrs per WT). No hint on smoke to be found, however, the mesquite clearly mellows this one. It's much smoother than most WT expressions.
Would I spend the $39 they ask for on a bottle? I am on the fence leaning more towards a buy than a pass. Would I buy another pour? Absolutely. 3-3.5/5. Just plain nice. Nothing more."

3.5,"The selling point for me was really the mellowing in mesquite. I was really hoping for a more present smokey profile with a hint of bbq. But what I got was a really smooth, good quality, full flavored bourbon. Its nice and woody on the nose, and goes down easily. Nothing to complain about! just would have been nice to see the mesquite shine through as a flavour enhancer."

-
To the palate, like the nose, it is very sweet up front with just a touch of spice that arrives with the oak.  Smoky notes of barrel char appear with a subtle barbecue flavour, maybe some sweet mesquite wood charcoal notes.  Sweet vanilla, dry cinnamon, bright lemon zest, syrupy maraschino cherry, buttery caramel popcorn.
-
In the finish resides some savory spices, cracked black pepper, dry oak, barrel char, lemon zest and sweet smoke.
—
With a drop of water, the candied lemon zest starts to dominate the candied cherry on the nose.  A little more oak dryness in the palate with some spice and a touch of sugar cane, but very thin mouthfeel.  The citrus dives towards orange peel in the finish.

Bourbon Mark: 87

This was different than I was expecting for being lower proof.  It’s sweeter than typical, yet richly flavoured, though less smoky than I was hoping for with the mesquite that was very subtle.

It has a slight spice to it which I  enjoy and feels a little bit like butter in the mouth. I wish it wasn’t $40 and more along the $30. it’s a great easy to drink every night sipper in the $30 ball park but at $40 it’s a stretch. 

If someone put Russell’s reserve 10 year and this in front of me I’d choose Russell’s. Both are great bourbons but Russell’s is giving me a better value."

4.0,"A bit different from the standard WT101. A very light, but flavorful bourbon. Though 101 is not my normal, this is s enjoyable daily sipper. Vanilla and char on the nose. An extremely smooth, due to the filtering, vanilla and cherry bomb. It has just enough to keep it interesting. I find this similar in style to 4 Roses Small Batch, less floral. This is actually kind of dangerous for those used to drinking higher proof drams, you keep sipping expecting the burn that doesn’t exist. Lots of stone fruit on the finish."

Take a nice deep breath and you’ll get a few waves.  A surprising amount of sweet fruit at the front, sweet corn, with a hint of smoke on the back end.  Texture has a nice creamy feel, but also thins out a bit.  The sugar and char on the tongue is interesting.  The taste is much darker notes than I was expecting.  Vanilla gives way to chocolate and more smokiness.  The legs go back to a fruit.  It’s approachable and complex.  Much different experience than my first taste."

3.0,"43% abv

Nose: sweet and inviting. Hints of charred oak, vanilla, dark chocolate, maple syrup  and cinnamon with a bit of bbq smoky sweetness in the back (likely from the mesquite “refining”)

Taste: initially quite light, creamy and almost fruity, but quickly develops into sweet vanilla and light sugary toffee followed by drying dark chocolate and roasted dark coffee bean. A slight but pleasant bite at the tail end.

Finish: medium with hints of light salted caramel, vanilla, cocoa and little bitterness and nutmeg.

Value: $25-$35 USD. For the price I’d personally just reach for a bottle of 101 but I don’t regret this one-time purchase.

Final thoughts: this is an interesting one certain to polarize fans of Wild Turkey. The lower proof chosen by actor Matthew McConaughey when crafting this bourbon was almost certainly to make it a sipping whiskey straight out of the bottle. In that respect they succeed, and the addition of some mesquite (or rather, “refined” mesquite, whatever that means) is a nice touch on the nose but offers little else than a nod to his home state of Texas. Perhaps at a higher abv this could have been a truly standout pour, but as is it’s more of a easy, pleasant sip with a little flair.

Score. 3/5. Recommend trying or buying a bottle at a good price.

Not much vanilla or caramel; some tannic bitterness upfront but then settles in with nutty toffee and orange citrus. Finishes with some spicy cracked black pepper, and smokey wood notes; finish lasts longer than you would expect. Mouthfeel is super soft and delicate. While nothing here really knocks your socks off, it’s also strangely easy to keep reaching for more. At $40 it's definitely overpriced, but worth the $29 I paid."

3.75,"Longbranch is one of many Distillery-Celebrity creations to boost sales, but this one is actually a quality product. Matthew McConaughey teamed up with Eddie Russel from Wild Turkey to make a new creation featuring his native-Texan mesquite.  The bottle lacks an age statement but Wild Turkey stated that Longbranch contains an 8 year bourbon in press releases. Wild Turkey filters Longbranch twice, first with charcoal made from American white oak and then with charcoal made from Texas mesquite wood.

It is a mild flavor alteration to their standard bourbon and when it’s combined with older (8-year) stock that is less fiery and spicy and more sweet and oaky with a hint of smoke. Longbranch has a sweet nose of caramel, vanilla, and toffee. The palate is creamy caramel and spices subtle smokiness and the Wild Turkey hint of oak and char with spice layered throughout. The finish is warm and dry as the caramel and spice linger through the fitting end of this well-marketed bourbon."

3.5,"A weekend getaway with dear friends upstate for some good company, whiskey, cigars, warming fires and much needed laughs. I picked up a bottle of  Longbranch for us to share.  I always bring something up to expand the horizons for my friends who normally drinks JD.  The price was right and, never having sampled Longbranch thought would be worthy for the weekend. 

A sweet nose opening primarily of cream soda, vanilla walnuts.   A nice soft counter of cinnamon,  leather with a little earthiness of damp leaves on an autumn day.   Not overblown. Soft, warm and inviting. 

A soft, lightweight draw delivers, again, cream soda, vanilla with a nutty base. White pepper, wood spice and leather counters the the sweetness and crescendos towards the finish. 

A semi long finish of wood spices, tobacco, leather, pecan crumb pie ride a semi long finish that works its way deep down, warming. 

From nose to finish rides the theme of sweetness and spice.  An easy sipper (no ice needed)  that is simple and enjoyable.  Perfect for autumn evenings to share amongst friends for simple conversation. One that may be worthy for an everyday sipper.  Reasonably priced and enjoyable.  [86/100][$40][Tasted: 10/13/19]"

3.0,"Wild Turkey has only two mashbills: their bourbon and rye whiskey. Their bourbon recipe is 75% corn, 13% rye, and 12% malted barley. Any Wild Turkey Bourbons that you purchase will have this recipe when it is distilled, regardless whether it is their Wild Turkey 101, Russell's Reserve, Rare Breed, Kentucky Spirit, or Longbranch expression.
Wild Turkey collaborated with Matthew McConaughey in developing Longbranch and he apparently was closely involved in the process and not just a famous face acting as a spokesperson for the brand.
McConaughey being from Texas and Wild Turkey being in Kentucky, it was important for them to make sure both places were represented in Longbranch. To achieve that,  Longbranch bourbon is filtered the first time through American White Oak charcoal to represent Kentucky and second time through Mesquite charcoal, representing Texas. It is also the only label to have someone's signature other than Eddie Russell's.
Nose is sweet with cornbread, brown sugar, and vanilla. On the palate there is caramel, green apple, black peeper, charred wood and a bit sour patch candy at the finish. It is definitely a Wild Turkey bourbon but with a bit of its own unique character."

3.5,"Nose: Sweet corn, candy-floss, vanilla, pencil-shavings, orange zest, a low-key but pleasant oak note and there's an agreeable creamy, nutty, leathery quality. I don't detect the faintest whiff of anything smoky on this nose - maybe a sootiness like barrel char but it's vanishingly faint.

Palate: Sweet and gently spicy-hot arrival. The development brings out vanilla, corn syrup and very mild cinnamon spice and light orange oil. The texture is juicy and silken (much more so than Wild Turkey Kentucky Straight Bourbon) and there is a demerara sugar presence in the background.

Finish: Medium. Sweetly creamy with a touch of baked apple, sour cherry and spice as it tails out into a well balanced aftertaste.

Although the nose may seem initially light and a little shy it has a density of character that will fool you. I tasted this together with a dram of the standard Wild Turkey bourbon, and in comparison the standard seemed spirity and sharp whereas Longbranch was rich and enfolding. It is creamier and definitely sweeter than the regular bottling.

This is almost certainly due to the oak and mesquite ""refinement"" because as far as I know this is just regular Wild Turkey bourbon-mashbill distillate given something akin to Lincoln-county filtration - and filtration is what it is, it's not flavour enhancement. The mesquite contribution lends no smoke to the profile that I could detect (however please note that in Australia this whiskey is sold at 80 proof instead of 86, so it's possible that 3% extra alcohol may carry a little more smoky character). There is certainly a subtle sooty, charcoal-like presence, but it's nowhere near the sort of smokiness you get in an Islay single malt.

A pleasant sipping whisky, good neat or on the rocks, but as a mixer or with Coke I found it to be a bit too sweet and lacking in presence, so ironically I preferred their rougher Kentucky Straight Bourbon for that purpose.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"
3.75,"Tried neat- very smooth, you can definitely tell this DOES NOT need any ice to enjoy!

The finish is bold and smooth with an easy finish. I'm looking forward to seeing how this one opens up over time.

Recommend as it's unique and bold, better than most."

3.5,"Solid bourbon. The mesquite comes through for sure. 

Good, I'd buy a bottle again, but not as soon as this bottle is done"
4.0,"Trying this one out neat. Been a long time since having anything with wild turkey in the name! 

Nose - honey, vanilla, light cinnamon and oak or smoke.

Taste - this one starts out super smooth on the tongue. Oily I would classify it. Everything I’m tasting on this one is well balanced. There is not one particular taste that overpowers the rest. Light vanilla to start, some subtle nuttiness, some oak, at the very end get a very very light burn and Smokey taste. Really enjoyable.

Overall and value
A great looking bottle and wild turkey product for around 30-40 range. I think there is definitely value here in my book. The bourbon has a lot going on from start to finish. Style points for the bottle and large wooden tipped cork. Overall I think this is a pretty solid choice."

4.25,"I will say I quite like this.  I know it's Matthew McConaughey's bourbon so I did all I could to remind myself that a bourbon isn't good just because a celebrity says it is.  Despite this, however, I objectively do like this.  It's not the best bourbon I've had, but the thing I love about it is that mesquite influence.  It turns this bourbon from some basic entry bourbon into something that's actually pretty different than most other bourbons in this price-range.  It has this beautiful old-fashioned dusty flavor that I generally find in Scotches that I love.  It has some rich vanilla and caramel notes that's wrapped in this ""smoky"" blanket.  The reason I say ""smoky"" is because it's not smoky like an Islay Scotch, but it has this charred BBQ quality that I absolutely adore.  Because of the mesquite charcoals, it does have a character similar to that of Tennessee whiskey.  However, I find it less sharp and easier to drink than Tennessee whiskies of a similar price.  And that brings me to my final point, the price.  I got this for $40.  And I believe that is too much for this.  When I was on vacation I saw it for 32 and 35 a couple of times and didn't want to risk flying with it in checked luggage.  But, for that price I could see myself getting this again and if prices around my area decrease then I will.  But this is not a $40 bourbon.  This is, in reality, a $25 bourbon that's been improved through a unique process so I'll give it an extra $10 to make it 35, but that's about it.  So if you find it for 35 or below then definitely get it because it probably is more different than anything else at that price."

3.0,"Love me some Turkey products. This is good, but not my favorite. I feel the description of the flavors is true to what the distillery claims, however, it feels a little thin for me. There's a brief pleasant smoky peppery wave that lingers on the palate, but the initial mouthfeel is thin and it feels like it takes a while to get going. For the first couple seconds after a sip it's almost like I've taken a sip of water, then BAM, a little smoke and pepper which lingers briefly and fades. Ok, but not in the same league as Russell's, Rare Breed, Kentucky Spirit, or even the 101 in my opinion."

4.0,"Ok, I was wondering if the celebrity bourbon would not be good...but seriously, this is great. On the nose I get vanilla flavor, first sip can garnish the heat, but after a few sips, I feel like it it is smooth.  I tasted some oak after the sip."

4.0,Sweet fruit/ honey vanilla notes.
4.25,"On the Nose: All I get is Maple Syrup and Honeycomb.

Taste: Honey. A lot of honey. Flaviar says Caramel but it’s straight up Honey for me. A healthy amount of spice and the tiniest hints of oak and smoke for me. I know a lot of Youtube reviewers mention smoke but I don’t get much.

Aftertaste: Just that Honey goodness with maybe 1% smoke/char from the barrel.

Overall: A really really solid whiskey. The warmth is comfortable and level throughout. The strong sweetness is balanced by the spice. I’m glad there are only tiny hints of oak and smoke. They struck a nice collaboration of flavors here. If you enjoy American whiskies you’ll definitely love this one. Definitely becoming one of my go to’s."
3.25,"Nose - faint vanilla, oak, and charcoal.  Taste - smooth, mild, sweet. Very slight spice with a mellow but short finish. Overall not bad. A pretty easy drinker without much complexity."
