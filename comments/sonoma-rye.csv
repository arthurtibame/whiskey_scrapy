3.0,Never had a 100% rye before. It was pretty rough and very spicy.
1.0,"Not what I was expecting, very harsh on the front and continued all the way down, never got the real taste of a Rye whiskey."

null,"Cask strength. Bought in Sonoma at distillery, very good."

1.0,Has a lingering alcohol/plasticy taste that really cuts through and ruins whatever else is there.
3.0,"If I could give this a 3.5 I would, because while it wasn't my absolute favorite I thought it was unique and interesting among the ryes I have tried. The official tasting review pretty much nailed what I got out of it, though my overriding impression was cinnamon Christmas cookie on the nose/cedar wood on the tongue. Just intriguing. Would like to try an older expression if they ever make one."

4.0,Bold. Gingery. Solid.
4.0,"The noise lets you know that this is a rye. It also has hints of vanilla, cinnamon, and floral. First notes are somewhat thin but warms up nicely with pepper, other spices, caramel. The finish stays with you holding the rye with a bit if oak.  This is a nice young rye that will be a good in any setting.."

5.0,I love this rye and I need another bottle!
3.0,"Lot of burn on the front that really turned me off. The vanilla and pepper on the back was nice, but not enough to save it."
4.0,"very sippable rye in neat form. Probably a good transition rye for Bourbon fans due to it's high sweetness, but plenty of spice for the true rye fans (like me!)"
3.0,"Decent whiskey, and the lower proof here is ideal, carrying the notes of malted rye, spices and dill quite well. It's not my cup of tea, but then again... this ain't tea. Cheers!"

5.0,"The yeast used imparts a 'carpet showroom' nose and taste, much like Chuckanut Bay's whisky. I've only tried the cask strength version."
4.0,"Smells like butterscotch. tastes very savory, almost has hay/wheat like elements."

2.0,"Okay, so this cask strength rye is a coppery rust color with thin watery legs.

The nose feels dry and has notes of hay, dry old lumber, dill, and unfortunately, polyurethane. That note is a big turn off for me.

The palate is mellow yet almost chewy and has notes consisting of yellow corn, sour herbs, and green strawberry.

The finish is not long nor hot considering the proof, and leaves almost a snickerdoodle taste. Cheers!"

2.5,I'm usually pretty forgiving with Rye based whiskeys but this one really isn't that great. it's got the usual Rye characteristics but it's got a bit of a weird bitter burnt floor polish type plasticy ethanol taste going on.
