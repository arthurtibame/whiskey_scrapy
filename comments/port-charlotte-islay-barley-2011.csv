4.25,"PC Heavy Peated

The nose reminds me upland stream smell or clear water pond and a campfire put out with a bucket of water. Ash and steam. A hint of fish in hand - catch and release smell. 

On the tongue the mouthfeel is worth the price of admission. The opening act is lively with salt and dry smoke - a dash of butter - a tinge of vinegar or tart ginger. The backend is wide open and empty with some smoke muted green grass.  

Simple and good and lively. 

In one word - estuarine."

4.75,"Opened this bottle a few days ago and went back to it today with a friend. Maybe it’s the company but it’s even better today. In addition to my previous review I’m getting a ton of SWEETNESS on the palate. Probably the honey note but I’m getting a bit of something citrusy too. Just a little and I didn’t get it at all on first opening. I will re-note...the amount of burn on this is amazingly slight for a young whiskey at this ABV. I’ve had many a bottle in bond bourbons that have way more bite than this. The 8 year Lagavulin has a lower alcohol content, stayed in the barrel longer, and was much harsher. This is smooth and sweet (apparently) while being a peat bomb. I finished the glass and a half hour later my fiancé walked by the empty glass and did a slight recoil. I asked her what was up and she just said “smoky!” Couldn’t have said it better myself!!"

4.5,"Short legs show it’s youth. Little drips sit in the glass as you swirl it. I have missed Islay malts while on a mountain getaway with a bunch of bourbon lovers. The nose is wonderful and perfect. It’s campfire, salt and sea just as you’d expected from the PC line at Bruichladdich. I know that all the barley is Islay and I think that’s awesome. I’m not smart or well traveled enough to be able to taste it but it’s a wonderful thing to note about the “Terroir Matters” people over there. It gives a handmade microbrew feel to them. The taste is classic. Again, I don’t know how to say it better than sea and salt. I haven’t been to Scotland but it makes me think of the North Atlantic. Kinda smells and tastes like the Maine coast (plus peat). I should try this with lobster or is that too much Maine? Regardless, there is no burn in this (full disclosure I’ve been drinking a lot of cask strength lately so my tastebuds could be dulled 🤷‍♂️). This is long and smooth on the back end. I still feel the salty sweetness behind my molars minutes later. This is wonderful."

4.25,"Light smoke than the port Charlotte. Still smoky but closer to a tobacco smoke with a bit of salt and brine. Palate is fruity and sweet, with the smoke taking a back seat to the flavor. tastes like a smoked bourbon. Still a little meaty but not as wild and hot as the port Charlotte. Bit of pepper on the finish as well."

4.0,"Pleasant, but not overwhelming. Tastes young, but at just shy of 7 year old, I suppose it should. Too often hints at the possibility of what could be had it aged alittle longer. It is good but has a hard time standing up to big brothers 10yr and MRC:01"

4.75,"A delicious dram with notes of smoke, peat, creamy vanilla, floral, pepper, caramel, citrus, and chocolate. Not as good as the 10 and wish it was a bit thicker on the palette but delicious nonetheless."

4.25,"Nice peat flavor that is very bold upfront, but dissipates quite quickly. Balanced with some sweetness that is reminiscent of honey. Slight burn at the end. Overall good Scotch, but would like more flavors."
