4.0,"very smooth, but not a lot of strong flavor"
3.0,"Nose - Vanilla, fresh red berries, sweet toasted brioche, very faint sweet mint.
Taste - Somewhat thin mouthfeel, vanilla brown sugar simple, fresh strawberries, fresh red berries, hint of drying lightly oaky brown sugar sweet, tiny bit of cinnamon spice, very faint menthol-like mint at the very end.
Finish - Spice fades fairly quickly leaving a red berry syrup sweet that sadly fades to a bit of a splenda-like sweet, light bitterness like that of a charred cinnamon stick.
Score - 77/100
Final Thoughts - Sadly disappointed in this one. I guess maybe because I had high expectations and then it wasn't as great as I anticipated. It has a decent nose, a very fruity sweet smelling rye. Sadly a bit thin and dry on the palate, you taste what you got on the initial nose, but the finish is where it kind of falls apart. I'm not a huge fan of the artificial sweet transition I get that reminds me of Crown. Tasty to start, but a bit thin. It's pretty well balanced on the front end, but it's like a hurdler that gets a great start, but trips on the very last hurdle. I wouldn't turn down a pour of this, but I probably wouldn't pick up another bottle."

Sweet and floral and fruit notes on the nose, quite pleasant. Just the right amount of spice if you're not looking for a lot. Actually tastes a little like some scotches I have so it has hints of smoke and peat on the palate along with raisins.  At least that's what I got from my bottle even though I'm not sure how that's possible. Finish is real nice and you get those port wine in there for a good bit. Good drink especially if you like scotch IMO, but not my favorite."

2.0,"Sad to say, I did not find much to enjoy in this thinner, older version of Whistlepig, which blends together rye aged in Madeira, Sauternes, and Port.  The mixture of finishes sounded pretty impressive to me and I was expecting an explosion of complex flavors.  Instead, the immediate and dominant aroma was an antiseptic or cleaning alcohol scent, unexpected given the low proof, and then a dilute mixture of brown sugar and wood.  There is a rich, underlying roast grain accompanying each sip, along with some mild honeydew, but that was about it.  That being said, the finish was better than the 10, with a nice, lingering mixture of sweet and spicy.  This costs $130 around here, but I would have thrown up if I'd paid that price for this rye.  I'm wondering what's up here.  This came to me courtesy of a sample from a friend, so it's possible that this was just an overoxidized, end-of-the-bottle pour or that the sample bottle wasn't adequately cleaned.  I just cannot believe this rye is this mediocre.  I'm cautiously providing this score for now, but may try to get another sample and try again later."

I wish this were higher proof, and a little bit richer finish, but those are minor quibbles. Worth the price when you can find it around the $100 mark, since there's not much to compare it to in that range. More than that and it starts to lose it's value proposition."

Nose: Fig, brown sugar, vanilla, baking spices, and red wine.  Smells almost like brandy.

Flavor: More sweet brown sugar and vanilla notes, heavy baking spices, dried cherry and date.

Finish: Surprisingly short for a 12 year rye and this doesn't check any of the boxes I want for an age stated rye.  Basically zero spiciness.  Just a short sweet finish.

Overall too sweet for me and lacking the rye spice that I think would have offset the sweetness that the various cask finishes brought in.  My first Whistlepig taste and I'd be curious about some of the other varieties but not enough to buy them at the high price tag."

4.0,"Tasting-  2 oz neat pour, this is Binny's 2020 release finished in Meade cask finish.  Source is confirmed as MGP Indiana

Nose:  Cereal bar dominates, some honey, and dill.  There is a distinct rye seed in the background.  It is a pronounced nose that will be hit or miss,no inbetween.

Taste:  Spice hits you upfront and quickly gives way to fresh strawberry and honey.  There is a grapiness on the back end and a bit of seeded rye bread.  

Finish:  Holiday spice cake is what I get tempered by raisin and for days.  Honey is in the background but not like a floral or clover honey.  I wouldn't say it finishes like a fruit cake.... because NOBODY likes fruit cake, but it reminds you of that without the chewiness.

Overall: I was pleasantly surprised.  I am usually suspect of Whistlepig offerings because the sourcing is so ambiguous....sometimes Alberta, sometimes Indiana, sometimes bits of their own.  These 12 year finished versions are very upfront with that and this one was 100% Indiana (MGP).  That said it does have a dill on the nose for sure.....traditional MGP rye, love it, hate it but expect it.  What really got me though was the flash of spice and then the smooth rich sweetness that followed.  The finish on this was well done.  The price is another factor.  At 119.99 MSRP this is steep.  I understand the age and the extra finishing barrel though.  I can justify this and will use it among my fireside chat whiskey, equivalent to the way I regard Midwinter Night's Dram--  induces sweet dreams."

3.75,"Neat. DEPs Bespoke blend. 30% Madeira, 50% French, 20% Port.  A bit more dill forward on the nose than I remember from the standard Old World.  It’s a bit brighter than the standard, less red fruits.  Instead I get more pears, apples on the front of the nose.  Spending a bit of time with it reveals mid range notes, light oak and baking spices.  This is way more port influence than the standard but i can’t find it on the nose.

On the tongue I again get the pears and apples.  More sour than sweet.  Tannic.  On the taste more pear and apples held together by vanilla. The finish and legs bring out the other influences.  Red fruits, port, burnt caramels and baking spices.  Lingers for quite a bit despite the low proof.  Tannic and drying.

This was fun to explore but I think I like the standard Old World Cask better (off memory.)  It leans into these pears, apples, peaches and apricots but the sweetness isn’t there to balance the experience.  Sour and tannic.  Hopefully this one opens up with some shelf time."

4.0,"I find myself once again at the alter of the Pig. Everything I have tried from WP has been fairly spectacular and I have been anxiously waiting to try this one. 

Nose is a bit spicy rye with an undertone of sweetness from the finishing barrels. First sip follows this same course. Rye pepper on the front giving way to an almost cherry sweetness followed by a mellow warm burn finish. A few sips in and the pepper bite softens a bit letting the fruit character come through stronger. 

Not sure it is my favorite WP to date, but another damn fine offering from the Pig!"
4.25,"Spice, smooth, rich on the nose, slight vanilla, excellent full finish"
4.5,"Easy is the word. The strong Rye spice is there, but it smoothes out quickly with a subtle fruity sweetness. This whiskey is expensive, but it’s worth the price. One of my favorites for sipping neat."

4.25,Whistlepig never disappoints and this 12 year Rye is no exception. Nice and spicy at first with a smooth sweet finish. Worth the extra $$$ if you can splurge occasionally.

3.75,"Another Whistlepig another satisfying experience. Not a fan of the strong peppermint flavour but really nice balance and all round delivery. Strip out the peppermint and you'd have a really top notch rye for me. All spice and cardamom were noted by others and yes they are the next most predominant flavours for me. As much as I dislike the peppermint (not as prominent in their Canadian version from memory), great quality. 4.25 for quality and 3.5 for flavour preference. 3.75 it is!"

4.75,"With how unique this aged rye is, I had to taste it several times over the span of a quarantine month to finely tune the profile. Especially since it tended to change with how frustrating the news was that night. 
The nose will reveal a slightly astringent, but still inviting, bouquet of herbs with hints of rosemary. Palate is a highly complex and delectable maze of flavors. Starts with brown sugar, bordering on molasses, and roasted pecan coming through together simultaneously. The maze meanders with deep red wine barrel staves and dried apricots. Adding ice opens up the grassy and hay notes from the rye. It also uncovers dark chocolate that hides before the ice. The finish, if you can put your glass down, varies back and forth between sweet and spice so candied cinnamon comes to mind covering both flavors."
