3.5,"This is the first edition.

From the label: ""An extraordinary range of mature grain and malt whiskey casks from North British, Strathclyde, Carsebridge, Glenfarclas, Ben Nevis, Balvenie, Kininvie, Glenfiddich, Alt-a’Bhainne, Auchroisk, Glenallachie, Westport, Speyside and (of course) Macallan distilleries, were blended and married in first-fill Oloroso sherry butts...""

Nose: Honey, vanilla, berries, oranges, nuts and lemon cake.
Palate: Silky, slightly viscous and oily with sherry notes and vanilla.
Finish: Medium to long and warming with the sherry and lemon cake making a reprise.

This is a tightly wound whiskey that took a long time to open up. Very rewarding though once it did.

Wouldn't buy it at retail, but a great deal at near half of that for a blend which contains however small amount of 33 year old Carsebridge and 30 year old Macallan."
3.75,"Another interesting one, some classic dark sugar flavors but with some fruit on the backend. 
Nose - caramel, bright fruit and grain
Taste - starts with light caramel and ends with an unexpected fruit note, like strawberries and flowers
Finish - pleasant floral finish with no burn at all"
