4.0,"Most well rounded whiskey I've had. First on the palate comes the soft peat with a fair sweetness. For the rest of the time there's a back-and-forth between sweet, spicy, pretzel like saltiness, and the soft peat flavour that keeps coming back."

3.0,"Campbeltown Chronicles #4: My sample was the 13-year bottling. It's a softer version of the Burgundy cask, less herbaceous and peaty but with the same sweet/smoky/earthy profile and balance. Call it 3.5 stars."

2.5,"As always disclosure, rumor has it this uses ""organic"" barely which is either a marketing tool to steal money or potentially more dangerous.  Thankfully they don't say it on the bottle or box so I don't mind buying it!  

Nose - I get white grapes, freshly peeled, a touch of salt, some grass, and a bit of meaty peat.  Then I get a touch of oak way back there, very light.  These are not first use bourbon barrels!  

Taste - it's soft, gentle, opening with white wine, turning a bit to a vinigar/peat/salt/brine type note, at no point is this sweet, always a bit acidic, a bit salty, a bit meaty, but minimal sweetness.  i started to think of balvenie 25 year single cask but that has that wonderful honey and more of a tea note, but there's a similar lightness to the start.  The peat and so they say Springbank sulfur are really the showcase (I don't think springbank is sulfur but that's how it's often described).  

I won't shock anyone by saying the sherry finished is on another level.  I've got a 19 year single cask, cask strength bourbon barrel version of springbank I'd like to try side by side with this.  This comes off much more salty and peaty, but the bourbon isn't really doing much and the oak is pretty minimal.  The other springbank to try this next to is the 9 year local barely.  This is really just a showcase of the new make and it's a good new make.  

Maybe letting my bias in, but it's great new make, very good whisky, but nothing special and springbank is going to be polarizing.  If you like springbank this is a buy.  If you don't, I'd stay away unless you're just looking for something unique."

4.0,"A very pleasant Springbank, with those familiar aromas you either love or hate depending on your point of view. I personally enjoy it and found this expression to be crisp and fresh, with notes of soft peat and salt. The smoke is so faint it almost isn't there, and while some reviews have identified fruity aromatic compounds, I mostly experience very complementary floral notes and barley (sweet and toasted). Interestingly the palate is a little bit of a departure from what one usually experiences with Springbank, with the body being much less oily and full-bodied - it's rather light for something at 46% ABV. As for the finish: prolong and satisfying. I can see myself buying this bottle. Cheers!"
