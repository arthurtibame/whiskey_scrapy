3.5,"Spicy, Smokey, slightly sweet.  They say the aroma on the nose is supposed to be honey and lemon which I want to say I get.  Still learning.  I can for sure smell the smoke.  I liked the 18 year better.  This was given to me for free as a 200ml bottle. The more I sip on this the more of a Smokey taste I’m getting and I actually like it."

4.0,"The aroma on the nose is very fresh and inviting, of freshly cut grass, flowers (rose and magnolia), almonds, orange, a drop of honey, nutmeg. Lemon cream. Slightly balsamic.
Warmer and stronger on the palate, with a slight spicy push (nutmeg and white pepper), flows oily while keeping its soul sweet and herbaceous soul, with more honey, orange, lemon and cereals. Slender peat in the background, little more than a curl of smoke with a metallic note. Constant and frank in the aromas, very drinkable.
Long enough finish, with a touch of salt, spices, orange, honey.
Complexity and evolution are certainly not among its characteristics, but it is a blended whisky quite pleasant to drink, well balanced in its aromas and rich enough to leave you satisfied."

But add leather, possibly citrus or herbal. Lingers into the finish--peaty whiff on the finale. Viscuous, a bit oily. 

Pairs well with a smoky, extra dark chocolate bar."

3.0,"Usually I like the more honeyed sweet stuff like this, but to be honest, I've had better. The nose is a load of hones, some hints of smoke and a bit of orange peel. Tase is straight up honey cereals. Bit on the thin and watery side to be honest, but the thick honey kicks in just in time to make you overlook that initial impression. It's tasty for sure, but there really is not a lot going on here. It's friendly and easy to drink, but boring. Good choice for a beginner, but then again, Dalwhinnie 15 blows this out of the water, even for a beginner. Another whisky in that category would be Glenfiddich 18. So yeah..out of those 3, Walker always finished last. Talking about finish...there really is none. Short, sweet, gone. Stick with green or blue label, those are at least interesting."

3.5,"Nose: Rich, oily and malty mainly due to a hefty and obvious proportion of Clynelish. We're off to a good start. Citrus fruits and a touch of smoke.

Palate: Sweet light honey, citrus flavours, beeswax, red fruits and cereal. A very clean and fresh delivery that is just slightly maritime (again, Clynelish). A delicious mouthfeel that becomes sweeter in the development. Juicy & zesty.

Finish: Medium long, satisfying and sweet but the late finish tails off into a waxy, resinous place that has some sourness in attendance.  This was the only real negative aspect.

The grain whisky component is very good. Overall it compares well to single malts and blends in this price bracket. It is quite delicious and yes not as good as the old 18 year Gold Label, but really not that far short.  The difference is mainly a lack of some authority from very good oak in the 18 year old and some complex spiciness that is missing.

The dry glass is smoky with a touch of fragrant, floral honey. Water is not needed but a couple of drops does not hurt - the profile remains intact but is fractionally softer and it blooms slightly.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"

Taste - Light white pepper spice, faint wisp of smoke & brine, watered down honey & aged apple cider/calvados.

Finish - Light lingering white pepper spice, light saline, ""clean"" sweetness of watered down vanilla/honey, light/soft/mellow wood tannic.

Score - 75/100

Final Thoughts - So this is a bit of a step up from the Black in that it loses that weird splenda-like sweet I got. It definitely tastes like it has some older whisky in it as it has that mouthfeel that only years in oak can have. Still very one-dimensional and ""smooth"" of the light caramel & apple/pear flavors. The target market is definitely for those who just want something simple to sip on and not have to think to hard. Would make a decent highball I think.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

The nose is the star of this dram. Lots of golden honey and clearly a higher concentration of malt whisky than grain. Think west Highland moving towards Irish. 

The taste comes in full on the front. It’s reminiscent of Cardhu, but an older, richer version than Cardhu 12. I can sense the Clynelish too, as it gives some meaty backbone to the palate. The finish comes off a bit thin, but it’s coating and lasts a while. 

This was a treat. Still not sure if I’d buy a bottle, but again House Walker is strutting it’s stuff. Cheers!"

3.75,"With the gold label we start moving into Johnnie's higher dollar offerings. The nose on this bears almost no smoke and has a hint of ethanol. Flavor is not quite as smooth as double black, but still has the familiar almond hints of the Walker line. An ok pour, but not worth the step up in price from double black"
3.25,"A few sweet notes on the palate right away, but then the earthiness takes over. Not much of a finish due to it being a blend. Not quite smooth and complex enough to be a great sipping Scotch, but too earthy and peaty to be a great mixer."

2.0,tiene whiskys de grandiosas destilerías como Clynelish pero creo que su error es embotellarlo al 40% debería tener más graduación alcoholimetrica y mejoraría casi a llegar a las 5 estrellas

3.75,"A scrumptious blend, albeit grossly overpriced for what you're getting. If you happen to stumble upon an open bar at some industry event, by all means should you hoover up the JW Gold when someone else is paying. Otherwise, stick to any of the myriad of blended scotches that sell for $40 or less. It's just as good for the money."

3.5,"Honey, malt and apples on the nose, same on the creamy palate, the finish is medium length with a hint of malt and peat smoke."
3.75,"Solid. Just got an airplane bottle. Not sure it’s worth a full bottle. Very similar to the black, but a little less smoky and a touch more sweet."

4.25,"beautiful whisky. very creamy and full of vanilla and almonds on the nose, with peaty smoky notes. on the palate is sweet at first with a honey and vanilla flavor. medium body, you get a spicy sensation after a couple of seconds. the finnish is bitter for a beautiful complex whisky. Lots of honey. 85 over 100."
