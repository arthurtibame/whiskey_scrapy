2.5,Decent
4.25,"Flowers and almonds welcome the nose, with an initial alcoholic disorder which, however, subsides until it disappears letting the whisky breathe. Fruity aromas with orange, gooseberry, blueberries and melon are accompanied by a certain vinous dryness. Honey. Fresh and grassy side on the background, with a touch of wood. Very rich.
Freshness is the leitmotif of the tasting, a background that caresses the palate by counteracting the peppering of the mouth. Spices (cinnamon, nutmeg), nuts and fruit (orange, raisins) lie on the turf, with plenty of honey to cover them. Hint of wood.
Medium and dry finish, with honey, spices and wood.
Not particularly complex but rich, perhaps not yet very balanced but with an underlying freshness that you don't expect.
Being the entry level of the distillery, and at a more than affordable price, you can only promote it, giving many expectations for the future."
