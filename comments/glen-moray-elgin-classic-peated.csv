2.0,"Color: normally i dont comment on color, but this whisky is so light in color that i just had to mention it. like it has only been in contact with wood for a very short time, or the wood has been reused very often. 
Nose: very light and simple. a bit unappealing actually. I get light peat, lemon zest, and vanilla. not much more.
Taste: also here its light. Light on the peat, and then a LOT of sweetness. i can get cookie dough, ripe banana, dried apricots, caramel. a bit oily. 
Finish: gone before you know it. dark chololate and peat on the finish. 

I would recommend this on a summer evening when you are not looking for deep interesting whiskies that keep on giving, or for people who are new to peated territory. For the price its an OK whisky, but its just too simple to please in the long term. the taste will grow on you after a couple of sips, but it will never blow you away."
2.5,피트 향은 옅지만 맛은 생각보다 피트하다. 하지만 특징있는 피트 맛으로 보긴 어렵다.
