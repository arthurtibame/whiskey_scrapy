5.0,"Creamy, caramel"
4.0,"[4.3.2016] What better whiskey to celebrate a successful dissertation than one brand that started the bad habit for me. In-laws brought this back from Dublin museum last month and it outperforms its billing. I hadn't realized the impact of grain alcohol mixed into my Jameson until I had this less perturbed mixture. 

Sweet malty grain is much stronger than common Jameson. Still subtlely floral and fruity with enough honey you can claim this for medicinal uses. This is the best Jameson I've had to date. Smoother, and thus more dangerous, than any other Irish whiskey on the market."

4.0,"Picked up a bottle while in Dublin in September, 2019.  Very smooth as typical with the triple distilling and leaves a nice, warm mouth with a medium spice finish."

4.5,Caramel and vanilla notes. Bot complex but just about right for an Irish. I loved it almost enough to warrant another trip to Dublin.
3.5,Light creamy floral. Easy to drink.
