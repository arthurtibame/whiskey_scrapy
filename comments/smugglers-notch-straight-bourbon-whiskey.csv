3.25,"First sip really burned and I was not fond of the flavor, but as the ice melted I started enjoying this more and more. By the end I wanted more. I guess you can’t trust your first sip!"
5.0,"Maple syrup and bourbon don't typically go together... But the smuggler's Notch is different. My smoke test doesn't produce false positives - this bourbon is delectable to the very last drop. 
😏👌"

3.0,Tasted neat in glencairn - Sweet with nice long finish.  Not much heat with this easy drinker.  Leather and oak.  Real good for local craft. At least 4 years age stated.  I’d like to try it at barrel proof to get a better sense of the source flavor.  Batch 5 / Bottle 1074 / Dated 2014

4.0,For a young whiskey this has a lot of flavor. The finish is strong but plays well on the palate. I really like the potential of this whiskey
