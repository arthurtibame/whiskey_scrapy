5.0,"Surprisingly smooth and easy on the back of the throat.  Notes of apple and white grape make it a little sweeter than the standard Crown Royal.  Overall, very pleasant."

4.0,This is one of my favorites. It's a highly engaging spirit that is very easy to drink. Sweet and spicy. The finish stays for a while and is amazing.

3.0,"Bottle #2 of a 12 Days of Christmas Gift Set:  Nose is pretty faint, with just a little apple and pear presenting.  Palate is very smooth, and tastes so much of grape that it present more like cognac than whisky.  After a few seconds, traditional flavors of caramel, vanilla and corn arrive, but don't last very long, and aren't very pronounced.  The finish is short, slightly drying, smooth and pleasant.  Not a bad drink by any stretch, but also not very challenging or complex.  Light, fresh, and easy to drink, this could be just the thing to get that fence sitter started on the whisky trail."

3.0,"Strong fermented juice and rye spice on the nose. Very smooth on the palate, with a silky mouthfeel. Orchard fruit dominates, followed by a hint of wood and a slight alcoholy, bitter note that perhaps turns into cacao nibs. Surprising warmth going down; it's no Kentucky hug but it's more than you would expect for 80 proof. It's a pleasant sipper especially if you want an enjoyable drink for a mindless session, but for other times it may be too subtle. 9/6/17"

3.0,"Pretty darn mildly decent. Taste of that smell when you walk into a tire shop. Sweet rubbery. Not unpleasant... but unexpected. Pretty nice. Sweet, smooth, and fairly Canadian. Like Canada, I kinda like it but nothing worth writing home about. 3 stars seems too low by 4 is too high. 3 1/2 stars."

4.0,"I'd call this really a 3.5, but I'm feeling generous enough to round up. This is a notable improvement on the standard Crown bottling - that extra age leads not only to extra smoothness, but more pronounced flavor. Not that you'd guess it from the nose, though, which is virtually nonexistent. Fortunately, the palate is full of brown sugar and spice, with that unique grain quality that I only seem to find in Canadian whiskies...must be the blending of 100% grain specific whiskies together. I don't know that I'd pay the $45-ish that I see this sell for, but it's pleasant enough."

2.75,"Top Canadian... repeat purchase.  UPDATE:  Yes, for a Crown Royal,  it's good.  I won't be a repeat buyer.  There are too many better selections.  Nose is simple.  The palate is not complex, and the finish is only medium long."

1.0,"Very Light nose, slight char, hint of Carmel subtle grain at the end.

Taste leaves something to be desired, not very complex. It’s smooth with almost no bite of your use to maybe some higher proof. 

Best for mixing in your favorite soda."

4.25,"Rich, smooth mellow"
3.0,"Smell notes: light with small hints of citrus. Too deep of a smell to get more out of it tends to just burn.

Taste notes: thick consistency with watery mouth feel. Overly sweet with strong notes of vanilla. The char from the barrel is noticeable after swallowing. Light burn that is nice in comparison to crown royal deluxe. 

Overall, it’s okay. Too sweet, but the burn is subtle and pleasant. The char is also some of the best I have had."

3.75,"I am not a fond fan of canadian whiskies, and i really had only a handful of them so i am not a real source of knowledge in this field. As Canadian Club and the other two Crown Royals i have had (Black and ""normal"").

Bottled at 40%abv, tawny color.

On the nose, it is so dim and not very fun. Honey, rye sweetness and some herbal notes.

On the palate is easy drinkable, with honey and peanut butter notes. Aftertaste is simple with some tobacco notes and some spiciness, ginger and clove.

Overall, my score for this dram is 76 over 100, its not my cup of tea, but there is nothing off-putting in it."

3.0,"You really have to dive in close to get the nose, unlike other whiskies ive tried

Nose: cherry , fruity, light, slightly browned Apple

mouthfeel: watery, not oily at all, drops straight to the back of your throat, only thing that tells you it’s whisky is the slight heat at the very back of the throat. 

Taste: cinnamon, grapes... very hard to pick out flavors for lack of much flavor."

3.5,"The nose is rich with peaches, vanilla, grapes, and oak. The palate is very sweet with flavors of apple juice, spicy oak, caramel, and cinnamon. The finish is long and very mellow with a few subdued spices.

The whiskey is certainly enjoyable, but not remarkable. I remember this bottle being about $35-$40 when I bought it several years ago, but it seems now the price has risen into the $50 range. At that price you can find much better whiskeys, in my opinion."
