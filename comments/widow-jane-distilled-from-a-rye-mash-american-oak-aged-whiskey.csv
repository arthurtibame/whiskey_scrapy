4.0,"Had this soon after the Black Maple Hill Rye (Green Label) and it reminds me of that. A little bit less grassy, a little smoother, sweeter, easy, and balanced.  A little less nuanced. A little more forgettable.

I think this is a pretty neat (interesting) pour. Obviously somewhat spicy but less so than your average rye.  Lighter in color than many pours.  A touch of clove. A touch of spiced wine."
