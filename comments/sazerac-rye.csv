3.5,"Smell - initially carmelly sweet, fades to a sharp allspice

Taste - very soft and mellow up front, way less spice than I expected, almost earthy to me, gently fades into a spice sensation on the lips and an easy warming burn."

3.75,"Solid pour neat, with a bit of a burn. A couple of drops of water soothe the burn. Also great as a 50-50 split with a bourbon to make an old fashioned."
4.25,"Wow, If you find this buy it all. Pepper and cinnamon, yet sweet and smooth, everything a rye should be but often times are not. There is too much to say about it to describe. I put this up against any rye under $90 and it wins!"

4.0,Great when used for the cocktail it’s named after!
3.75,It may not be bursting with flavor.. but man is this juice smooth. Hints of toffee and a tad bit of pepper lead to one of the easiest drinking whiskeys I’ve had.
3.75,Thanks Scottsor.  Very smooth

4.5,"Neat.  Opened over one year.  I recall loving this but it’s been a very long time since I have had a pour.  My rye experience is also much deeper than it was when I bought this bottle.  

The nose is very nice.  Balance between sweet corn and rye spice.  No dill or black licorice.  Nice floral, honey and caramel.  Black pepper.  Rye bread.  Goes back and forth from being bright and then mid-range notes.  Lots of dusty corn.  Getting some fruit but again bounces between light and mid-range.  Apples to raspberries.  It’s a great nose.

Nice creamy texture despite the proof, quite oily.  Cherry sweetness on the tongue almost maraschino cherry even.  Transitions to a nice vanilla and caramel, leaves you with rye spice.  Decent oak presence on the legs, leaves a drying sensation.  Deep into the legs, I do get some black licorice now.  I might even say it starts as red licorice at the beginning of the experience and then transforms to the black licorice by the end.

This is a really good, easy sipping, super sweet rye.  Even at 90 proof, it’s creamy, oily and packs some dynamic flavors.  I honestly thought I was going to be disappointed revisiting this one after so long but it is very good."
2.5,"Spicy rye, thin mouthfeel, short finish. Warm in the chest. A little medicinal to me, though not rated that way. Would drink again, probably wouldn’t buy a bottle."

4.25,Strong orange citrus smell. Definitely some spice too. Clove for sure. No burn in the smell. Big rye and citrus taste as well as some caramel and vanilla. Very smooth neat. One of my personal favorites.
4.0,Soft earthy nose with a little bit of fruit mixed in. Wonderful blend of fruit and spice on the palate. Starts of sweet and finishes with a nice pepper heat. Very good. Not bad for my first rye!
4.0,"Sazerac Rye is a no age statement rye whiskey that any whiskey enthusiast can enjoy and wants in their collection. It has a simple but elegant throwback design for the bottle and looks great in any collection, the mashbill is undisclosed but has 90 proof/45% ABV. Although not expensive, Sazerac Rye is a premium rye whiskey that is approachable but complex and unique.

Color: Bright Bronze

What beautiful legs on this whiskey. It only gets better, upon nosing I noticed hints of coffee, dark chocolate, rye bread, raisins, burnt caramel, plums, and clove. Following is the palate with delightful hints of toffee, warming rye spice, leather, and dried red fruit. However, it is a little dry. The finish is long with consistent notes of rye spice and a subtle licorice note."
