4.5,"I was curious to buy this, and finally saw it at my local warehouse. Did not disappoint for the price. 

I get a lot of similar (but of course a bit less pronounced) notes to the Booker’s Country Ham that I picked up recently. I wonder if the same cooperage was used for some of that batch. This is very nice - a bit hot at first, then mellows out with a lot of wood and fruit.

3.75,"Great sweet full caramel nose, especially after resting for a bit. Palate is pretty standard bourbon - rich and caramel. Finish is spicy and long. Very good stuff. 

$10 USD per pour

3.5,Tastes of hay and oak from the quarter casks that were blended in.  Meh.  Doesn’t marry well.
4.25,Nice smooth whiskey.  One of my favs
3.75,Very vanilla forward nose that leads to oak and a little banana and nutty notes. Overall a interesting product.

4.25,"The nose starts with charred oak and cherry syrup, followed by burnt caramel, molasses and some slight rye spiciness. The palate is dry but rich and starts off full of vanilla and charred oak while the cherry doesn’t fill carry over. It is joined by caramel, creamy rye and plenty of char. The finish is medium with vanilla and oak that sticks around for a while before slowly fading leaving a bit of rye spice."

3.75,"Compared to the SmB this seems more spicy, sweet, and floral and less nutty. Definitely prefer the standard 🙁"

3.5,Not bad just bland
4.5,Hints of floral with vanilla. Burn is classic KC. Oak is strong with the aftertaste.
3.0,Nose is weak but sweet and peanuts pallet is spicy heat comes in sharp but doesn’t stay into the finish kind of average bourbon all the way around. Expected more but not bad.

4.0,"As a Knob Creek fan, this one does itself justice.  The 100 Proof rating is as authentic as most pre-probation offerings.  KC Quarter Oak is a fine hitter for those that enjoy avoiding the 86 blends.   Quarter Oak pays tribute to the craft of American Whiskey making in its original form."

2.5,"While I appreciate the approach, I don’t care much for the end result. It’s so intensely sweet and as it sits and opens it turns to peanuts, to the point that’s nearly all I’m getting towards the end of a glass. Love the experimentation, but it’s not an improvement over the original Knob Creek."

4.0,"Nose is medium strength aroma of vanilla, caramel, apple, plum, Brazil nut, grass, and freshly cut oak. A hint of floral underneath which is odd for a Knob Creek product. Appealing.

Palate opens with a standard caramel + baking spices vibe along with the plum from the nose turning into more of a prune. Not much going on in the mid-palate; cuts quickly to the finish. But just when you think this might be boring or sub-par, in comes a delightful medium-long finish of milk chocolate, walnut, and more of that fresh oak from the nose. (I am a sucker for a good finish so this scored pretty well with me)

Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I would like for this flavor profile, but it’s a minor flaw. Suuuuper dry. Like “bleached cows jawbone in the Arizona desert” dry. A little bit of prickly tingle on the tongue that really started to add up with repeated sips, almost like the building heat of eating chili peppers. 

Overall I really enjoyed and feel it’s worth the $57 I paid. Knob Creek has been knocking it out of the park lately with their new expressions. If you are a KC fan (as I am) then run don’t walk to grab this before it’s gone and the 12 year version as well. You won’t be disappointed."
3.0,Big corn sweetness in the nose with vanilla with high proof present. Starts with oaky start with some spicy in the middle. Mellows out to a vanilla and banana finish.
