5.0,I got this hoping it would be a cask strength version of the 18 year and that's exactly what I got. I wish the price was a bit more reasonable because it's still a hard purchase knowing how good it is. Definitely recommended

3.0,"Fine, but nothing to get excited about. I was hoping for a bit more depth coupled with a pleasant kick. The finish is hollow and brief; drinks more like 80 proof than 105 and, to my despair, I was unable to find the peat."
5.0,Beautiful stewed fruit notes.

5.0,"Perhaps the best HP limited themed series of late. Typical HP profiles, but not as peaty. Bit on the pricy side."
5.0,"Big in your face whiskies like this are much easier for an overworked palate to appreciate at a tasting event like The Whisky Show London than more subtle stuff. Nevertheless, this was one of the most impressive whiskies of the day."

null,"** Disclaimer: This review is what I would consider a “Quick Hit”- meaning I won’t have my usual in-depth notes that I usually like to take. The reason: this sample was poured at Whiskyfest DC on 4/17/18. All of these reviews will not be scored and I am actively looking to try them again at some point to do them more justice.

This is it.  This was the best whisky I tasted at the festival.  This is what HP should focus on- it was sherry flavors turned up to the max, a great representation of the wood cask notes that’s been missing in some of their recent, NAS Viking-themed releases, etc.  The power was turned up here and the juice holds up well against the higher ABV.  It was rich and creamy, sweet and smoky- yet powerful.  A whisky drinker’s whisky lol.  This is easily a 5 star dram and I’m really looking forward to the companion bottle- The Light.  It should be a dynamic duo if they took great care like they did here with The Dark.  It’s on the pricey side at $260-280, but I think it’s the best stuff to come out of HP since Odin.  Find a bottle and buy it.  Great stuff.  Cheers.

This wraps up my Quick Hit recaps from Whiskyfest DC.  I’m not sure I’ll attend this event annually because the costs associated with it were just a bit too high.  It definitely didn’t live up to my personal hype and wasn’t worth the $345 VIP price point."
null,"Review #8 of 12 from DC Whiskyfest 2018. I was only able to do 12 because I came down with something that afternoon that really messed with my head and stomach. I should have just stayed in the hotel room but I didn’t pay $350 for VIP tickets to sample my pillow!
No scores for anything sampled as I don’t think it would be fair.

Strong sherry, wonderful dates, raisins and earthy nose. 

A spicy palate full of sherry, a little peat and something I couldn’t place but loved. Excellent 

This was probably the highlight of the night. If I were giving scores this would be a 4.5-5. I wish it were more affordable."

4.25,"There will be a time when marketing schools will offer a class called ""Don't be Highland Park"". A brand that has exceptional respect among whisky drinkers, but seems hell bent on ruining their brand equity with what can only be seen as the worst marketing perhaps ever. 

Highland Park The Dark takes this to all time extremes, offering a highly sherried whisky in a black opaque bottle, throwing it in an expensive yet cheaply finished ""wooden"" display box, throwing a CHEAP black bag over it, and then putting some god awful horrible looking snake or something on the bottle...ok honestly I don't even know that I've looked at the thing on the bottle, it's just too stupid. Then the best part is they mention ""only"" 28,000 bottles as if we're supposed to see that this is mass produced and think ""oh it's rare"". No...28,000 bottles that retail for about 300 USD aren't rare and will ultimately be sold at a discount (which is why I am bringing this to you, I didn't pay 300). 

OK marketing aside, heavily sherried highland park is one of my favorite things out there. I'm a fan boy and while I don't believe this is CS, it's over 50% which is another win. I'd also assume non chill filtered and natural color. I'd try and find out but the only information on this bottle from HP is on this packet in the box where I'm only assuming a summer intern wrote it up and then had an 8 year old proof read and frankly I'm not going back through the incoherent ramblings to see if they mentioned it. My incoherent ramblings here are free!

Nose - I let this one sit out for about 40 minutes to let it open up and it's really changed from my first few nosings. When I have nosed this in the past it was sweet and to the point I thought a more dessert/waxy type wine cask was used. Now I do get distinct sherry notes though I'm not sure what kind (and I don't believe we know more than European oak casks). I wouldn't be surprised to hear PX, but I hesitate for one reason.  This isn't a classic HP malt back, this is dark and charcoal smoke influenced. There isn't a touch of HP peat here but a good couple of a dashes of a very assertive peat. It's almost off putting at first but quickly becomes the highlight of this one. The sweetness seems to generally win out on what dominates the nose but that smoke back there is different and it's playing with everything. I can't compare it really to any other peat out there and I like that. Sweet and dirty charcoal smoke, if that doesn't scream scotch lovers scotch nose I don't know what does.

Taste - when i first poured this a friend commented that my eyes watered. I was in bliss with the depths of complexity. I'm no less excited by this one today. A classic aged but not OLD sherry influenced malt opens this one up, sweet, almost bubble gum like, very PXy to me (watch this be oloros). Then the whisky takes on transitions and depth. Tannins give way cinnamon that bites, then burnt smoked meat, and charcoal, and next day grill notes come out. This all explodes in richness, power, and depth. HP often is a good mix of sweet and peat, but this different. This is sweet THEN peat and both have been turned up to 11. I can totally see drinking this on a bitter cold night outside by a campfire and it just taking me to a special place and frankly I can't think of a better dram for that having had this. The peat here I can't stress enough is just charcoal and smoke, not earthy clay, not medicinal, just charcoal smoke and perhaps complemented by some hot cinnamon (this isn't red hots cinnamon). 

Overall for me the spice levels and bite on the finish are a bit more than I find truly enjoyable. I know I raved on and on about it and for good reason. It's both a unique experience and truly special. I just you know, would rather get to explore and enjoy that sweet sherry with a bit more classic HP malt/peat. That said I also can't stop going back to this glass. 

4.25 a completely wow level whisky and if you can get this at a discount, get it. At 300, lets be real, those stores are going to discount or you can ask for one.  That said it's well worth the 300, it's a unique experience and a really good one. There's still plenty of it to go around and I expect these will still be on shelves in a few years."

4.5,"A bit closed lips on the nose. But a complex, tight flavor bomb. Lovely dark fruits and sweets followed by sherry then deep smoke and peat. Pleasantly surprised based on so-so reviews."
4.5,"I tried this at a big whiskey event, so it wasn't the kind of experience where I could take detailed notes (not to mention the palate being pretty exhausted by the 17th or 18th mini-dram).  All I can say is that this bottle beat the pants off an even more exclusive offering, the 15-year-old Florida exclusive single cask.  That younger scotch came from a refill sherry and was predominated by nutty, bitter notes alongside classic Highland Park honey.  The Dark is completely on the other end, and it tastes like a product aged primarily in first-fill PX sherry casks.  It's not the most balanced, but it tastes like grape jam and a hint of peat.  Strong in flavor, pleasurable, easy-drinking.  I have mixed feelings about Highland Park and don't like it as much as, say, Talisker, but this is the second-best Highland Park that I've had the pleasure of trying.  (No. 1 was Delilah's 13th anniversary single cask from about 12 years ago, which was the best sherry bomb I've ever had.)"

3.75,"Nose: apple, figs, sherry, chocolate, earthy peat (not so damp), rubber, honey, vanilla, slight nuttiness.

Taste: something a little skunky, earthy peat, rubber, subtle sweetness.

Finish: earthy, medium length.

5.0,"A nice mix of peat smoke, pepper, and heather and cask woody notes.  This tastes like peat, salt, burnt caramel, charred barrel, maybe marshmallow.  It has the classic Highland Park heather/honey but it is behind all the other stuff.  As the finish starts, it tastes like burnt marshmallow s'mores(the best kind of smores).  The burn adds a delicious layer of complexity which is very pronounced into the finish.  This whiskey is a wonderful showcase of smoke and char, but classic Highland Park still muscles through.  The finish is quite peppery amidst all the char notes.

This is the best iteration of Highland Park that I have had to date."

4.0,"A treat, both visually and tasting, but commands a high price tag. Is it worth it? That's up to you and your bank account. If you happen upon a bottle during the zombiepocalypse, make room in your survival kit for it.

smells a bit chocolate and smoky
tastes like macadamia nuts, chocolate, and a very nice smoky finish
heat was almost non existent
very smooth"
4.75,"This is inexplicably dark and more flavorful than you’d expect from a 17 year old, even cask strength. Peat, dark fruit, a never ending finish - this just blows me away. A stunning 97 and a winner among recent limited releases!"

4.75,"Big, smoky, sherried, and bold...this is a delicious bacon of a whisky, with warm chocolate notes, dark-almost-black cherries, and aged, well-maintained leather.  Not a starter dram, but if you like Highland Park, and it’s winter with a fire nearby (preferably with a large dog at your feet), please know that this is an excellent choice to perfect the evening."

5.0,"One of 12 1/2 or 1/4 oz pours drammers club. Very nice sherry and tropical fruit combination with notes of raspberry, coconut, citrus, banana, chocolate, and caramel."
5.0,Lovely caramel nose.  A treat
5.0,"Amazing, perfect, astonishing, an absolute masterpiece. An absolute must-have scotch. Highland Park absolutely knocked it out of the park with this gem."
4.0,Very peaty version of highland park 18
3.5,"Nose - (w/o water) Light smoke, white wine like sweetness, dark stone fruit syrup (w/ water) Opens up quite a bit more, dark cocoa nibs come out, mixes with a dark sweet sherry, hint of leather

Taste - (w/o water) Sweet white pepper tingle, light orange zest, light smoke, sweet lightly bitter dark stone fruits, tannic/bitter dark chocolate (w/ water) Tingle is gone, light orange zest, drying dark cocoa nibs, less sweet dark stone fruits, smoke is almost gone.

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering warmth, light fruity tannic bitter, charred citrus pith bitter, drying bitter dark cocoa nibs (w/ water) More quickly fading, fruity bitter orange/cherry/dark chocolate, cocoa nib bitter, light smoke re-appears at the very very end.

Score - 81/100

Final Thoughts - I didn't know what to expect with this one but I was expecting a bit more character out of this one. I got nice hints of sweet dark stone fruits on the nose, but it was quite muted. Some water opened up the nose quite nicely. Once it hit the palate it was a bit hot, the dominating flavor profile was this lightly sweet but very drying and tannic dark cocoa nib flavor that was a bit distracting from the sweet dark stone fruits I was expecting. Luckily I do enjoy dark cocoa nibs, but I wouldn't imagine that should be the dominating flavor. Overall it was tasty, but just not very well balanced.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"
