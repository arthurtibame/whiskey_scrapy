5.0,"Wow,  got this for $80 which I think is a great sweet spot for this bottle.  If you can get it for under a $100 this is worth the purchase.

Great nose / flavor, little to no burn on 98 proof.

I wasn’t sure it would be worthy as a NDP blended bourbon asking top dollar.  It is !"

4.5,"The label says ""deep oak... and warm caramel and honey"" coupled with ""deep chocolate, vanilla with extra spice"". Couldn't agree more. The nose is slightly muted for what I'd expect, but the mouthfeel and mature flavors that come after sampling are not holding anything back. This bottle will be one I'll be sad to see go, very good. Lower 90s for me"

4.0,"This is my personal definition of what bourbon should be. 

N: incredibly complex. Pears, apples, gingerbread, fresh vegetables, creme brûlée

M: so nice. Smooth, sweet, spices dancing, more fruit

F: long, warm, and oh so smooth and pleasant. 

I haven’t tried other blood pact offerings, but #4 is fantastic. 

$99.99 in MI 5/19/2018"

4.0,"I drank this neat with two large ice cubes in a rock glass. On the nose, I get notes of black cherry and toffee amidst the sour mash. On later sniffs, there is a noticeable toasted marshmallow scent. First sip is a quick creamy vanilla flavor that quickly progresses into a bready, spicy complexity with notes of cinnamon and rye toast. It has a lingering flavor of vanilla that comes through the initial peak of spice that slowly becomes leathery and slightly fruity on the finish. This could be the liquid equivalent of a good cigar."

5.0,Classic bourbon profile.  Medium to long finish.  Bottle has opened nicely over the last three months becoming a little sweeter and more vanilla flavory.  Overall a solid 91 or so.  This isn’t in the same realm as the big boys but would be a nice top shelf at any home bar

4.0,"Fruity on the nose, some sweetness and smooth finish. This is a very good bourbon, packaging is nice, and the limited quantity, mixed with marketing, drives a higher price. If this were half the price it would be a 5. That said, if you see it pick up a bottle, no disappointment."

4.0,"On a rock, started-out very astringent, immediately mellowed to a much more palatable finish.  Probably would not drink it neat. I do not taste the vanilla that other reviewers tasted. I task oak and liquor.  Hot."

3.5,"This will make you sweat like you've been running through the jungle with velociraptors in tow.

Yep, heat. Seriously, my teeth felt sweaty. Throw some water in, and it turns delicious. And velvet. And caramel. Some cinnamon. Some vanilla. Save it for the cold months, when the man-eating lizards have migrated to the warmer jungles."

4.0,"Sweet at the start but not overwhelming. Finished Spicy but smooth. 

Compared to Pact 5, this is a more traditional bourbon and had a longer, spicier finish. Personal preference was with the 5 because the rum cask was done well. But this is a great bourbon for those who like real spice and done have to sacrifice smooth consumption. 

Found this at Costco last year (2018) for $85. Seemed to be going for $100 elsewhere."
3.5,This is good. Drinks hotter than the proof. Get cinnamon and leather on the palate with a long finish. Not sure it is worth the price. Better options for less money.

4.0,"wish i had more time to explore this and let it open up.  rich, sweet,  dark fruit,  with bready flavor from the toasted barrels. this would be a good buy for 100 or less"
4.25,"I liked this.  A lot.

Nose:  Super classic bourbon with vanilla, brown sugar, caramel, pear, and some charred oak notes.  Very sweet smelling.  A little bit of background yeasty notes like fresh baked bread.

Flavor:  Not as sweet as the nose suggests.  Still plenty of sweetness but it is offset by leather and tobacco that mixes nicely with the apple and pear flavors and the vanilla caramel notes.  Still nothing super surprising but a great representation of a bourbon.  

Finish: A little spicy, black pepper, heavy barrel char, medium length.

This is a super smooth whiskey that doesn't punch at the weight its proof suggests.  I liked the extra char notes as they offset t he sweetness nicely."
4.5,"I don’t understand some of these tasting notes.  Vanilla?  Definitely!  Pear skin?  Give me a break.  It’s smooth tasting bourbon, loaded with vanilla."
