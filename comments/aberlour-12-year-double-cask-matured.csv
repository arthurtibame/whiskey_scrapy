3.0,"Aberlour 12; great price and fine example of a low ABV sherry, but there is nothing too original or defining about this bottle. 

Now don't get me wrong, I did very much enjoyed sipping this expression. At an easy 40 ABV with good sherry notes, this bottle has a place. And for the $40 price tag, it is a good starter scotch for someone who wants to begin dabbling in the art of Aberlour. But I feel there are more interesting and complex bottles out there. 

Would I buy again.....maybe later in my whiskey journey. There is many more intriguing bottles out there that I want to venture in, the Aberlour 12 can wait."

3.0,"Had a doubleheader tasting of Aberlour 12 Year Double Cask Matured and Aberlour A’Bunadh to confirm (or reconfirm?) my suspicions. 

Nose: Oak and creamy sherry casks are evident. Strong red apple - very akin to the red delicious variety. Ripe plums headed toward prunes. Lots of Christmas baking spices - cinnamon, ginger, allspice. Cake-like vanilla and butter. Hints of semi-sweet chocolate.  The malt and oak really power through the longer it has to open up. There’s a faint bit of oiliness like starchy French fries. 

Palate: Thin, sweet, and buttery fruits hit first, then the heavy raisins and plums kick in followed by waves of spice and oaky astringency. It’s a little light-bodied in mouthfeel but manages to be somewhat rich for 40% ABV. I feel like the palate slightly under-delivers given what the nose has going on. 

Finish: Medium length and warming. Lots of baking spice and oak, and astringency almost to the point that some people might wonder if it’s healthy to be drinking this much oak tea. 

Thoughts: My bottle is about half full so I’ve definitely had opportunity to visit with this. I just feel like this dram is a bit disjointed - I don’t think the knowledge that this comes from a mixture of casks is coloring my impressions, it’s just missing the integration I’d like to see. I wondered if I would enjoy Aberlour 16 more until I saw @jonwilkinson7309 ‘s enlightening review. Still a fairly solid dram and a reasonable value if you can find it sub-$40. It’s just lost in a very crowded field competing for your attention at this price point and I’m more inclined to spend a few dollars more to get a better integrated Balvenie 12 Doublewood. 

3.0 ~ 76 ~ Average"

This is a sweet whiskey, but not PX sweet.
I can taste the malt and the sherry, but it has sort of a funky sherry flavor that is a mix of raisins, walnuts, with a slight winey/sherry sourness, almost like a fino.  I get a blend of caramel, burnt brown sugar, and cocoa.  There's also something very herbal and grassy in the mix.

I also get a bit of barrel, perhaps a bit of char, and oak spice.

The balance is not perfect, it could probably stand a few more years of aging, but that doesn't stop this from being highly enjoyable.

The finish is a mix of the barrel spice, perhaps barrel char, sherry funk, and cocoa.  The sherry is really a tension between sweet and dry sherry flavors.  I don't know what kind of sherry barrels it's aged in, but it wouldn't surprise me if it's a mix of sweet and dry - I get something that reminds me of fino, despite it being sweet overall."
4.0,"A great standby for a sherried Highland.

Nice sweet sherry with some pleasantly soft malt to back it up.  I get a bit of barrel spice.  It's got a sweet finish with a hint of raisins.  

I'll need to do a more thorough tasting - I had this with some rich chocolate cake, so it's hard to parse out all the notes in contrast with the chocolate.  Though the chocolate and the whiskey make for delightful companions!"

3.5,"Tasted this at the end of a tasting evening just because a friend brought it and I had Aberlour on my wishlist for a while. I was reading lots of interesting things about the 18y old before and it had made me curious. So I gladly gave this younger brother a try. And - wow - it delivered more than I was expecting. 

It has a base sweetness both on the nose and palate but it surprisingly had more maturity then you would imagine. It is vibrant and fruity with a good bunch of dried fruit but also surprises with a deep richness with spices like cinnamon and  ginger and also offers some nice wood aromas. There was one thing that was a new experience which was a very subtle sulphuric quality in the direction of kala namak, which is an Indian salt that tastes like eggs. And while this sounds strange it fits in really well and puts a very positive touch to this whisky. 

I will definitely get my hand on the 18y soon because this 12y really surprised me in a positive way."

2.75,"A buddy brought this over for some socially distanced drinking this afternoon. It’s not that it was bad, but it was just...there. 

The nose is a funky adventure, with sweet and sour notes (emphasis on the sour...), sherr rancio, and a mild vanilla from the bourbon casks. 

Palate and finish are much better, but still a little meh at 40%. It’s like Glendronach 12 on Valium. Fine to drink when offered by a friend. Not something I’d seek out, especially given the price for entry."

Taste: mild start, definitely low proof, pleasant sherry, not terribly complex, lingering sweetness and oak on finish, maybe a subtle spicyness?"

3.75,"Tried it once at a friend’s house and instantly liked how easy drinking it was. Got a bottle on sale. First impression of removing the cork is the strong whiff of malty freshness almost like the freshness of a cold beer. Some may say it’s lacking sophistication, but some could also say it’s good for a nice sunny day chilling in the back yard. Classic scotch characters with medium finish. Not a bad dram for the price."

4.5,"Darker golden rust colour from American and sherry oak. Longer legs suggests oily texture on the palette. Nose has vanilla, spices and creme brule. Palette of peppercorns, vanilla and honey. Relatively short finish. Added water heightens vanilla, fruity apple or apricot."

3.0,"Nose: cereal malt, heavy apple and cherry juice. light vanilla, black pepper, cloves/ cardamom, caramel, butterscotch.

Taste: very malty and watery with a spicy finish. sherry, figs, and cherries with a bit of apricot as well. Almost a pancake / fruitcake malt. Very strong sherry notes. 

Water turns it into hard cherry candy sweet, maple syrup and grapes. Notes of caramel and chocolate appear as well.

Honestly skip this one and go right for the abunadh it's easily 1000 times better"
