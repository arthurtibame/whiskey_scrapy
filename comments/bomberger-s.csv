4.5,"Smells of a forest. Dark caramel, creme brulee, black pepper, dill, pine, and shoe leather mingle together beautifully with the woodsy backdrop of this bourbon.

Vanilla and cinnamon red hots pop on the palate followed by candy corn, pine, cherry, and orange. Mouthwatering with a good finish and solid mouthfeel. Perfect proof.

Really impressed with the two Michter's Legacy bottles. I actually preferred Shenk's over this one. But I gave that a 4.75 so they aren't far off and both some of my new favorites. 

Highly recommend both"
4.0,"Little butter and caramel and wood on the nose followed by some light fruit, wood, and brown sugar on the palate. Very smooth finish with a little burn."

4.0,"2oz sample from Troy. Boozy aroma, vanilla and toffee and nuts. Very sweet, and very warm on the palate, finishing hot but not overwhelmingly so. A slight bit of sherry and fruit."
