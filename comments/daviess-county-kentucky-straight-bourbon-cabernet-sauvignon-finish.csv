3.75,"Nose: Rich, buttery, caramel apple, candied fruit and Cabernet tannins linger in the background. The Distiller review denotes the nose as “highly focused”.

Taste: Pretty traditional bourbon flavors with oak, space, vanilla and a little brown sugar.

Notes: Uses a combo of two mash bills: wheated & rye."

3.25,"Like getting rushed by a surge of zombies one day, then not seeing any Undead for weeks. This whiskey is basically a singular flavor all at once, then fades extremely quickly."
3.5,"Some people hate ""finished"" whiskies. I understand from the purist standpoint point of view they are bastardized drams. Fortunately I am not a high and mighty purist so I enjoy the variety for what it is. This pour is finished in Cab Sav barrels which is a wine I quite enjoy so my hopes are moderately high. Let's dive in and see...

The nose is interesting on this. Almost candied like strawberry licorice. The first sip has a little bite to it and the Cab finishing is definitely there with a strong raisin presence. A few sips in, the raisin takes a stronger spot on stage with a little brown sugar tossed in. The finish is a mild jamlike stroll to the sunset. 

I will be honest and say many people are going to hate this. It is not a straight forward whiskey. I think it is a nice departure from the mainstream."
