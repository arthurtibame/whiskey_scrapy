4.0,"Sourced from an undisclosed Kildalton distillery, this Cadenhead's malt presumably is one of the rare independent bottlings of Lagavulin. Mineral peat smoke, oysters and coal tar take you swiftly to Islay, with notes of pine needles, anise and seaweed emerging from the background. An impressive nose for a 7-year-old whisky! Raw and pungent, the arrival hits the palate with a wave of peat. Dry citrus, honey and bitter resin follow closely behind, leading to a prolonged, briny and slightly rough finish. This is 'Big Peat on steroids' and a silver bullet against colds.
