4.0,Nice amber color and initial knows of honey. On drinking it it’s warm have Paris but not quite the complexity of flavors that we would’ve hoped for an 18-year-old but still very nice scotch.
5.0,"Truly delicious! Has notes of vanilla, ginger, rose, orange and pear, as advertised. In addition, this new Soleo Collection release has an amazingly deep taste - and aroma - of soft, chewy caramel. The kind of soft, chewy, homemade, melts-in-your-mouth individually wrapped caramel sold occasionally at speciality stores. This was my first Glenrothes, and it’s a knock-out. Not a sherry-bomb, but rather the perfect amount of sweetness, with far more depth than I expected based on color alone (as compared to some of the other 18-year old whiskies I’ve imbibed over the years). This one is a keeper and will now occupy the sacred top-shelf area of my cupboard along with three or four other elderly (18-25 year) Scottish cousins."

3.75,"No. 3 on the GR tasting range. Fully sherry hit kicks in with this. Nice sherried drop but for $125USD you can do better e.g. Glendronach 18, Glengoyne 21, Bunnahabhain 18 etc etc. Still good to see GR OBs now no longer suck!"

4.0,"This pour was part of a free store tasting by Petite Cellars. Over 100 bottles of whisky were on offer for free. No brand representatives. Nobody trying to sell you anything. Just let the liquid speak for itself - awesome. 

With my wife, we ended up trying:
This bottle
Macallan 18 year fine oak
Ardbeg 13 year chieftains cask strength
Bunnahabhain 29 year John Milroy cask strength
Kilchoman private single bourbon cask
Compass Box The Spaniard
Glen Scotia 15 year

Out of those, we ended up buying this bottle for 125 USD. It was our combined favorite. My personal favorite was the Glen Scotia, but my wife hated it. 

With sherry cask maturation these days, you are happy to take “seasoning” just to avoid sulfur notes. This one had no sulfur. The sherry did not have the toe-curling depth that probably no longer exists in affordable contemporary Scotch, but I did get a burst of caramel popcorn on the palate, and candied ginger on the finish. It was unexpected to have a genuine memory evoked, and not reaching for notes. “I almost get a bit of...” blah, blah, blah. No. This dram lets you have a solid narrative. It gave something, when I expected nothing, and I bought a bottle to discover some more. 

This completely blew away the Mac 18 fine oak, by the way, which was priced $100 higher. I think I will talk about that next review."

5.0,"a very good lower priced alternative to macallan 18 with notes of chocolate, raisins, red fruit, caramel, citrus, honey, nuts, and pepper"
