1.0,"What the hell is this???

Garam masala (I SWEAR) on the nose - really peculiar and off-putting, and I love Indian food. Palate has spent matches, rubber and exotic spice. 

Originality: 10/10. Desirability: 0/10"
3.0,"smelled sweet like vanilla caramel honey, taste was bright and almost lemony.

Tasted at the Raasay distillery!"

4.0,"Very interesting and unique taste, seaweed seems present and lends itself to a Maritime Heritage but it is unknown how this arrived.  A whisky made in the highlands in the only Raasay Distillery.   A no age statement ‘while we wait’ whisky that will prove interesting once aged!!"

3.0,Better than I expected for a single grain whisky. A lot of bite at over 50% alcohol but still has a nice sweet flavour behind it. Tastes more in the realm of a strong bourbon rather than a single malt.
