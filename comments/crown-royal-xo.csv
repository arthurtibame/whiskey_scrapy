4.0,I've never been a fan of blended whiskey but this is very good stuff. I'm also a big fan of whiskey with an age statement but the XO is Nas. I tried this on a recommendation of a friend. I was pleasantly suprised. It will definitely have a place in my liquor cabinet.

3.5,"One thing Crown has always been is the benchmark for a ""spiced"" smooth whiskey if from north of the border,, as far back as I can remember(over 40 years) we always looked at CR as the special SPICEYwhiskey you could count on for a great drink and not make you vomit from some syrupy additive.
      
      The folks at Crown Royal have made their cognac cask finish whiskey a dram that lives up to the name in a distinctly spicey but honest flavor, the fact this bottle is often found at the same price as ""old blue bags"" itself,,  given its fine drinking it could easily take a spot in anybodies DAILY drinker row. 
      
      Great CR traditional taste with the always smooth and easy finish you expect and a hint of congac notes just to add some fun to life.  Its just slightly better Crown  at the same price as standard so this one gets 4.6 stars for being a magnificent value.
      
      If you don't like  Crown Royals already nice spicey flavor w/ a tad more complexity and  always smooth finish then go drink some ""fiarball"" swill and leave the good stuff to those with the good sense to appreciate it!"

Update: After refining my palate, this is ok.  I  am not a big fan of the Canadian whiskys."

3.75,"Lite body, fruity. 
This is a very easy drinking dram. But if you are used to more fuller body whisk(e)ys the ethanol might be too much. As it really dominates the finish.
Its an okay easy drinking whiskey. A bottle to share for sure."

4.5,Sweet and smooth
1.0,it's overly sweet and the actual whiskey taste is masked with a floral and waxy covering. it taste like crown Royal dropped a cube of lard in each bottle. With all that I can at least say I have a moderately expensive cooking whiskey now.

3.75,"This was a great find at the liquor store. Slightly sweeter and more complex than regular Crown Royal, but very smooth and sip-able. I like the notes that the sherry aging added, and I especially like how this blend isn’t overpowered by the barrels it is aged in"

4.25,So sweet and smooth. Beautiful amber color. You definitely get tropical fruit notes. Almost tastes like it’s finished in rum barrels. Big fan.

3.25,"Color is a dark Amber. Nose is initially a little heavy on ethanol. As the ethanol clears, notes of very dry fruit, mild oak, and subtle vanilla appear. First sip is smooth, slightly oily, with notes of toffee and vanilla most prominent. With additional sips the dry fruit from the nose starts to show Finishes with subtle baking spices, primarily nutmeg, that combine with the dried fruit. Overall, the flavor is fine, and more sophisticated than classic Crown Royal, but probably not worth the price difference, particularly with the higher proof Crown Royal Black available at a lower price point."
