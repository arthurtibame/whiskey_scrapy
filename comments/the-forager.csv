2.75,"It’s regular Forty Creek with some infused floral notes. If it were just a couple dollars more than the Barrel Select it would be a decent value - but at $35 it can’t compete in quality with similarly priced whiskies. It works fine as the recommended whisky and tonic, but if I’m in the mood for that I’ll just buy gin."
