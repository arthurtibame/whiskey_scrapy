I'm getting a mild honey/vanilla mixed with some oakiness, and a trace of grassiness in the nose.  Those notes continue into the palate, and there is some spiciness in there, too. Giving it some air and time in the glass is not a bad thing.  Finish is moderate, and gains a little sweetness."

5.0,The Balvenie is one of my favorite distilleries and this 15 Year Old Single Barrel Scotch is just fantastic! It's got one of the most pleasant noses I've ever experienced in a Speysider and just a drop or two of water produces an explosion of vanilla flavors on the palate. Classy stuff!

The finish brings clove spice then soft green apple. The mouthfeel of this is like a wave in the ocean breaking over deeper water; you expect a huge crash after a buildup, but instead it quietly diminishes. I'm impressed. Needless to say, I would like a bottle of this."

Had this at a balvenie raw craft tasting with the late great Anthony Bourdain. It was poured straight from the cask with a .50 cal world war 2 shell casing. One of the best drams of my life next the the sherry cask equivalent which was my next tasting experience in the same day.

4.0,"Amongst the crazy-busy summer with family, friends and major events this summer, I have been waiting to find a bit of down time to open this sample.  So, working my way into a Labor Day weekend, the day before a family wedding, I found a little sliver of time.
        
        Soft. Light.  Slight everything.  That’s the nose.  Slight vanilla, slight floral, slight honey, slight sherry aromas: raisins, walnuts, berries with clementines.  Let this whisky sit and really let it open.
        
        The arrival is gently sweet and immediately crescendos to an oak and cinnamon spice.  This is all contained in a thin body.  The crescendoing spice then falls to a soft sweetness of brown sugar and milk chocolate.
        
        A short and simple finish of oak and ginger.
        
        This is sweet and easy whisky.  I admit that I do enjoy Balvenie.  The 12, 14 and this 15.  It just works (for me).  Simple, sweet and enjoyable.  I do wish the finish was was longer and had a little more to offer.  Cost prohibitive, I understand, but still a worthy dram to seek out.  Thanks Pranay.

4.0,"Carmel, vanilla, sweet and light peat. Delicious."
4.0,"I've had countless samples of Balvenie at distiller events and whisky shows and always found it a perfectly fine if unremarkable drink. But spending a relaxed hour at home with a generous sample from Pranay gave me a new appreciation for the subtleties of this dram. In the calm sanctuary of my basement, I relished its nose of buttered toast. There's a creamy, clover honey flavor in the mouth that yields a very long finish of similar notes, rounded off with a touch of black tea. It's an altogether well balanced Scotch and a good lesson in how many whiskies deserve some quality time to truly take their measure. I could see myself returning frequently to a bottle of this quality."

4.0,"We're now starting round 2 of our little sample sharing team here, and one of my offerings is this Balvenie.  Of course, when I opened the bottle to share, I poured myself a wee dram as well.  Balvenie is one of those that stays pretty straight and narrow in its lane, and won't give you a mind blowing challenge.  This is the sweet girl-next-door that you can bring home to mom, and be assured that she won't say anything that'll get her blacklisted.  As opposed to an Ardbeg or Lagavulin girl, who will be wild and unpredictable, with highly inappropriate things to say.   Tasting notes: honey, lavender, and heather...through and through.  This is a rich and elegant.  Manuka honey ( Soba...you're a Kiwi...you'll understand), with  fragrant lavender, all wrapped around a field of heather.  This is the bottle you give as a gift to your in-laws, boss, or anyone you want to impress, but also stay relatively safe from wild flavors.  You can't wrong with this, but don't go expecting a whirlwind of challenges.  What it does, it does damn well.  Girl next door you can bring home to mom."

4.0,"Well, after a scathing group email I received this morning, guilt has finally prompted me to get my head back in the game- so to speak.  For those that may have noticed- I haven't written a whisky review in well over a month.  I started a scotch trading group with my friend Paul and about 6-7 weeks into it I hit the proverbial ""wall"" and dropped out of sight.  Last week I finally willed myself to open a few samples to try to reignite the spark.  One of the samples is this 15YO single barrel from Balvenie.  I didn't really take many notes so I'm writing this review mostly from memory.

This single barrel comes in around 48% ABV and was aged exclusively in traditional oak casks.  The nose was heavy with honey and vanilla sweetness with a bit of bitter orange peel striking through if you really got down into it.

On the tongue, it was very cloyingly sweet with a bit of cocoa coming through about mid-palate.  It, like most Balvenie I've had, was incredibly smooth and very easy to drink.  The finish was very bourbon-like and felt somewhat long given I haven't drank any whisky in well over a month.  But, it did burn so good.  I'm glad I chose a sample I figured would be solid, yet easy to drink in an effort to get back into things.

I know the asking price on this one is somewhere slightly north of $100, and normally that would be out of the question from my previous experiences with this brand, but damn if it didn't really hit the spot at the time.  Thanks to my friend Pranay for the sample and my mentor Paul for getting on my ass about getting back in the game (Lol, j/k Paul).  A very solid 3.75 stars.

Cheers, everybody."

4.0,"Stop number 22 on the SDT is Balvenie. This is my first review of Balvenie, but not the first I've had. This Speyside single malt was matured in a European oak ex Oloroso sherry butt (500L) for 15 long years. Bottled at 47.8% ABV and it appears to be natural color of an amber gold. It is also non chill filtered. This sample was generously provided by Pranay and was poured from bottle number 15, from cask number 2639. 

Initially on the nose it is somewhat atypical of a Speyside scotch. A definite spice to it with some darker sherry notes. Raisins, red berries and spiced Christmas fruitcake. Strong European oak with cinnamon and toffee. There is also some light vanilla and honey mingling in with the heavier spices. Some bitter orange peel and cocoa powder in the background. After some time to breathe, the more typical Speyside notes start coming through. Oranges and yellow apples and maybe some apricots. Definitely needs time to get past those pungent oak spices. It's very interesting and intriguing and not at all redundant like the beginning of this sentence. 

Quite the spicy arrival on the palate. Heavy oak and wood spices. Much like the nose, there is a sweetness buried under the spice. Sherry notes and orchard fruits like oranges and cinnamon dusted pears. Some dark chocolate bitterness in there as well but it's mild. The palate really had more of the typical Speyside notes than the nose did, but it's all dominated by the spice level. 

Medium to full bodied with a nice oiliness to the mouthfeel.  It's mouthwatering at first but turns fairly dry. The finish is medium long with apricots and that ever present spice carrying through. 

The first Balvenie I had was the 12 year Doublewood and I had it on the very first day of my journey into the world of scotch. Couldn't stand it honestly, but after trying this 15 year old I wouldn't mind revisiting it. I remember there being a lot of spice to it and that's probably why I didn't like it, so that's what I was expecting here. I got all that spice but I can now appreciate it. The European oak really did its job and the sherry influence was just enough to add some depth of character. Not sure if this expression is still available or if they have moved exclusively to a 12 and 25 year single barrel, but according to Pranay this one was around $100. Not really worth it in my opinion (all Balvenies seem to be overpriced), but I wouldn't turn down a dram if offered either. A solid 4 though. Cheers 


CORRECTION:  I was under the impression that this was the sherry cask matured version and not the older bourbon cask version. I was incorrect. Please take any reference to European oak and replace it with American oak. I'm surprised they got this level of spice out of ex bourbon barrels though!"

4.25,"Long day. Fun, successfull, a bit sad, but all in all, just long. Needed something sweet for this evening, and this fit the bill. 

Balvenie 15 starts with a very funky and weird smell. First thought was horse stables, but after a few sniffs it turns into raisins with chocolate. Weird. Really weird. There is also the barley, honey and citrus you would expect from this. 

Taste has the usualy barley and honey sweetness, the raisins and chocolate, some fudge for good measure (reminds me of clotted cream fudge somehow) and a dash of pepper thanks to the proof. Very nice sweet treat. 

Aftertaste is more sweetness and raisins, but never to an extent that it becomes overwhelming. 

All in all, good sweet stuff. Not sure if I would pay 100 bucks for a bottle if I can get the same with Glenfiddich 18 for less, but hey, it is worth a try."
4.25,"Oak and vanilla dominate the nose with a bit of peat smokiness coming through. Surprisingly gentle on the nose for the proof but in a good way. The proof definitely comes through in the palate though punching you with oak, vanilla, and a spice I can only say resembles more cardamom and ginger but definitely not cinnamon. The proof gives a longer finish which is much appreciated."

4.0,"Orange, grain, and cherry nose. A little hazelnut. Gets sweeter as you go on nose. A Sweet, orange, strawberry taste. A little caramel and cinnamon. Then sweetness comes back on finish."
4.0,"It’s not the sherry bomb that I expected. There’s not a lot of dark fruit here, but rather light, fruity, and somehow reminds me of honey and jasmine tea. Still, an enjoyable dram."

4.0,"Representing speyside dufftown

Nose: strong sherry, fruity, just a hint of vanilla, very light caramel, almost smell cake icing, slight malt, later just a touch of oak. 

Body: full, enveloping, firm and fruity

Palate: fruity again with a surprising spice later as it travels but smooth, almost a touch or whiff if burnt caramel, so good. 

Finish: long and warm, surprisingly long given the nose

Note: this is a delicious, fruity, spicy, smooth and robust dram. Not complicated just well crafted."

4.75,"my favorite balvenie, which says a lot. the nose has all the balvenie honey and confection, but in comes the deep Sherry influence and speyside light peat and leather. a dose of water will open up some melon and lemongrass. taste development is lush with sweet giving way to a flood of Sherry and spices. finish is good for a 15 year and leaves light and sweet. fantastic"

3.25,"Nose: fruity with a hint of oak.  A light but refreshing citrus


Taste: more and more fruit, some vanilla (once a few drops of water was added), back end with some oak and almost a brown sugar. 

Smooth and a great sipper to cap off the end of a day.  My second favorite Balvenie to only the peat week."
3.0,"Nose- lemon, caramel, butterscotch, raisins, wood spice

Palate- heavy sherry, raisins, dried fruits, cinnamon spice

Finish- long finish with notes of sherry and spice 

Would love to find a first fill cask with a better color to do a true review, but this is the one that I had in front of me. Pretty basic sherried whisky. Nothing really stands out. Nose is good, but has more heat than I like in 46% whisky. Palate is pretty one dimensional with sherry flavors and spice. Just ok."

2.75,"Stumbled upon a store with these still on the shelves and had a friend who wanted every bottle...so i grabbed 2 for myself and made the store owners a bit happy with the 7 total I left with.

Nose - I get their classic vanilla and honey notes no the nose, there's light oak, bread, and I'm getting light notes of red fruits. These are all bourbon barrels but their malt is so sweet and fruity at times. I love it. 

Taste - Honey, complex vanilla pastries, oak. and the finish leaves me with some dark honey and oak tannins. 

A very nice complex take on what is an otherwise simple experience with bourbon barrels and classic Balvenie malt. 16 years old and bottled in 2012. These aren't yet endangered but they are getting pretty hard to find. I think I like the new sherry barrels better, but this is an awesome change of pace and really showcases the malt and it comes in at a much lower price than the 25 years and it's way better than the new 12 year."
