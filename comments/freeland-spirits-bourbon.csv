3.25,Sweeter than the Larceny. Perhaps more caramel type finish or wine barrel finish?

3.25,"I finally got to taste this tonight while all my bourbon buddies were opening crazy things like Heaven's Door and Rock Hill Farm and Parkers 8. But no, I had to try this sample from one of my reps. 

I was a bit surprised as to the ABV on this. 46%, Batch 002, bottle 550. Ok, that's the technical stuff. The nose was pleasant with colorful and lightly toasted semi-melted caramel. The palate was much more intense than anticipated. I got blasted with something reminiscent of non-alcoholic fake dark cherry consomé with medium cinnamon spice. The feeling in my mouth was overwhelming, but not in a good way. Because of the moderately low ABV, this Bourbon felt way unbalanced. Everyone's a critic and maybe I've trained my palate to coincide with much bigger bourbon houses in the midwest, but I still think if this Bourbon would have been closer to 99 proof, it would have been much more pleasurable to drink. All I got was flavor without much on heat. 

Too bad, but I hope Freeland creates a barrel proof in the future. I will certainly look forward to it. 

Cheers!"
