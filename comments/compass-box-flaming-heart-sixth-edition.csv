4.0,Another great Flaming Heart. Tasted at the Whisky Show London 2018.
4.25,"It’s that special time again.  Time for John Glaser and the guys at Compass Box Whisky to release another edition of Flaming Heart.  This is their semi-annual, heavily peated blend meant to appease the “peat-heads” of the scotch world.  It’s been 3 years since the last release, though- maybe John and the gang has been getting stretched too thin with all the bespoke bottlings.  Cut that out, lol.

Anyway, this is the 6th Edition and they decided to add another layer to this blend by supplementing the blend with some sherried whisky.  Why?  I don’t have a clue- I just know the price has risen on this one by $20-25 and I don’t really like that.  But, we’ll leave that gripe until the end.

This one is pale yellow in the Glencairn and makes some watery legs and tiny drops on the rim.  It’s bottled at 48.9% and, like all CBW blends, has no added color and isn’t chill filtered. 

The nose is ashtray smoke and fresh ground peppercorn up front- so strong I actually recoiled a bit when I first went in.  There’s tar and alcohol steadily present and I got a bit of sweet vanilla over time- a lot of time, actually:  40 minutes or so.  It took a long time for the fire to burn itself down.  I’m not complaining, however, just documenting it.

The palate brings more abrasive smoke and BBQ’d rubber (if that makes sense).  The mouthcoat is still buttery with the faintest of sweetness finally bleeding through all the smoke and peat.  Dried raisins is about all of the sherry influence I get despite there being almost 30% of the blend being sourced from sherry casked Deanston.  The 40% from Caol Ila and 8% from the blended, French Oak casks are carrying the load here.  As they should- this is meant to be a fireball of smoke and heat.  It still predominately is, thankfully.

The finish is long and smoky with more ashtray and burnt leather.  It’s hot and dry and everything you love about true peat monsters (pun intended).

Overall, these are still in my wheelhouse.  The sherry influence escaped me here but I’m actually happy about that- well, except for the increase in price.  I had to pay $130 for this bottle and I feel like that’s $30 too much.  I miss my old $100 Flaming Hearts, I really do.  I’ll also gladly forego the added sherry next time, thank you.  But realistically, this is still a fantastic dram if you like your peat.  4.25 stars.  Cheers."
5.0,"Very nice flavorful dram with floral, fruity, vanilla, spicy, and peaty notes. Not a big peat fan but will tolerate peat when combined with sweetness."

4.5,"Info: Composé d'une grande partie de Caol Ila (29%) qui apporte de l'élégance à l'ensemble, on y trouve également du Clynelish (17%) et du Deanston (17%), avec quelques autres whiskies encore non identifiés. Cette édition réintroduit le fut de sherry, utilisé la dernière fois avec l'édition de 2012.

Nez: fumé de feu de camp, pas trop agressant. Des raisins sucrés. Des fruits frais. Vanille subtile. Du moins, un coté parfumé et floral. 

Bouche: Fruité-fumé. Fraise-raisin, fumé bien dosé. Des noix. Huileux et doux. Très gouteux. C'est évident que le blend est composé de produit de haute qualité. C'est tout ce que j'attendais de Compass Box. Je ne peux comparer avec l'édition précédente mais l'influence de Sherry est bien là et s'affirme de façon tellement harmonisé que j'ai de la difficulté à concevoir ce que serait ce produit sans l'influence de sherry. C'est parfait comme ça!

final: Fumé, chaud, fruité. Un coulis aux framboise sur du chocolat noir.

Overall: Way to go! Compass Box frappe un coup de circuit avec cette édition. Rien de trop gentil en bouche sans être non plus un coup de poing. La tourbe est agencé de façon élégante et émane une chaleur avec le taux de 48%. Intensité aromatique très équilibré entre le fruit frais et le cendré-fumé. Jamais vu un whisky qui portait aussi bien son nom. Ici autour de 120$ CAD, le rapport qualité prix est très favorable. Une flamme qui mérite un 94%."

4.5,"Nine out of ten times, can’t really go wrong with a Compass Box blend.  They are masters of blending, and unfortunately, people have noticed which makes their prices skyrocket.
This one here, the pour courtesy from my buddy @LeeEvolved, is no exception.  It’s pricey (now over $120), but it’s so damn good.  

Light, lemon-y, a touch of brine and a kick of smoke.  So damn good.  I’m glad I bought a bottle.  If you like peated, but not a smack in your face, then this is right up your alley.  
Thanks Lee!"

3.0,"On the nose is smoke immediately followed by fruit, but I can't pinpoint what type of fruit. Taste is a flood of smoke with a follow up if fruit, vanilla, and a hint of cream"

3.5,"Peat! Light and bright pear. Smoke, light. Butter, light. A touch of strawberry, bit of honey and some sweetness. None of this jumps out of the glass on the nose.

Warm and drawn out on the pallet. Peppery, more white pepper than black pepper. Spicy, from citrus flavor. Ash. Touch of honey in the middle."

4.25,"I like this 6th Edition better than the 5th Edition, but not nearly as much as the 4th Edition. The sherry influence in this one is evident, but not so much so that it strays from its core mission."
4.0,"Nose: very strong black pepper and malt with a hint of the sherry cask. Honey, vanilla cream, and light caramel as well. 

Taste: christmas fruit cake with very lightest hint of some peat at the back. Very intensely sherried almonds and grapes. The peat represents itself as cheese and bacon grease after you get past the sherry notes. Very dry oak on the finish

Water makes the nose very honeyed and crisp with pear notes. Taste is much of the same sherry notes with a long after taste of rubber"

3.5,"You can generally tell whether a limited run whiskey is a great dram at the right price point..if its sold out. 2 years later this still hasn't.  At $130 there are probably a couple of hundred drams (literally) I'd buy over this. Similar to the Juveniles release I'm picking a price drop. CB has been just too detached from reality over the last couple of years in their special releases. No doubt COIVD-19 may put paid to that. Sometimes when they do something special it really is hard to put a price on greatness and it's hard to argue if it's overpriced or not. There is no hesitation with this one..it is. Peat monster is 40% of the price and not to far off this one (albeit a different dram). I heard this was a pale imitation of the original and that seems correct. Simple Caol Ila style dram, higher abv and lighter style wrapped in expensive clothing and priced accordingly. Move on folks nothing to recommend purchasing hear unless you see it 50% off. Even then just go for the real deal Caol Ila 18"

1.75,"Nose - smokey under tone.  I get a deep earthy peat here, like the ground a few days after a camp fire.  Followed by a lot of sherry - they claim subtle sherry, this ain't subtle.  I do however still get some vanilla and bourbon oak as well.  I'm forgetting the blend but I'm pretty sure we're looking at talisker and caol ila (sure about some of that one) for the peat.  I get some talisker spice (I know I'll be called out as wrong for that but I'm risking it) and there's just a nature of Caol Ila I can't place but gives me this note.  Maybe a bit of grassy oily waxy elements at the sweetness as well (I'll likely be wrong on that whisky in the mix too so I won't mention it, lol). 

Taste - Wow the flavor isn't what I expected.  The bottle has been open since launch and been near half a bottle since launch (I hit this one hard to start).  I get a berry, then a distinct vinegar based BBQ, touch of smoke, vanilla, some older oak, some leather, tobacco.  I've never gotten this vinegar BBQ ever, i get a very ""springbank"" BBQ note, but NOTHING like this.  This is sweet honey BBQ.  

As it tames that BBQ goes and I get a bit of a Caragiale like notes.  The finish is pretty unique, bitter, touch of citrus, oak, vanilla, touch of sulfur, and a bit stale.  

I was going to give this one some fine notes for the nose but the flavor has dropped off.  There's a lot of interesting flavor here, but none of it goes well together.  I just can't give a compass box with peat a 1.5.  1.75 and only because of my bias.  

150 bucks - just pass."
4.25,"Like many of you, I love Compass Box.  Basically every CB whisky - core offerings, limited editions, peated or non-peated, super experimental or classic expressions.  While it would be nice to have one of each, CB puts out a lot of different whiskies (22 current offerings, based on the on the CB website), with a fairly high rate of turnover for the special editions.  So I'm trying to be a bit selective.

I've been particularly curious about the Flaming Heart,  so it was an easy pick from the Franklin Room's menu.  

It lived up to my expectations - peaty, bold and a nice fruit sweetness.  No bitterness, not an off note to be found and a nice smokey finish.  Nevertheless, I really wish I could have tried it alongside Peat Monster, which I recall as being very similar, and considerably cheaper.  And at $100+, the Flaming Heart has strong competition from a few other CB offerings.  So is it a buy?

In the immediate term, I answered the buy question the following day at Binny's in Lincoln Park (a great tip from @ANTONIOSCHMID).   The Compass Box selection at Binny's was phenomenal, as was the selection of local craft whiskeys and just about everything else.  Hard choices were inevitable. The Flaming Heart was on sale for $114, but in the end, I chose two different CB's - a first edition No Name, simply because of the degree to which the whisky senseis here rave about it, and the Lost Blend, because it also has some fine reviews and I suspect it will be a bit different from other CB peated offerings.

However, it looks like the availability of the current Flaming Heart is good, and I haven't ruled out a purchase yet."
5.0,"I have been dying to get my hands on this for quite a while, and my expectations were far exceeded. 

Lets start with the nose, oh the wonderful smell that is Flaming Heart. It has a light, sweet peat. The most vivid image that comes to mind is the smell of dry fall leaves burning on a crackling campfire, with toasted pecans and sweet jelly beans.

The taste is better. The first notes are light tar and rubber that are quickly surpassed by toasted sunflower seeds and dried apricots. As the taste develops on the tongue it turns mouthwatering, smoked burnt ends and a salted nut mix. If you let it sit on your tongue a peppery characteristic becomes apparent.

The finish is smokey, smooth, sweet, salty and warm all at the same time. The lingering aftertaste makes me think I just ate barbecue brisket.

Now I really want barbecue..."
