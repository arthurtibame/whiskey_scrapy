1.0,"This bottle is from the bottom of the barrel, and has barrel char sediment in the bottom of the bottle. Kind of cool. The bottle has been open for about a year, but still very full because I did not enjoy it when I first opened it. Time to revisit.

Color: Very pale gold. The young age really shows in the color.

Nose: Nail polish remove, char, little bit of an apple smell, and a touch of rye. This smells young and harsh. I am pretty sure the char note is from the particulates in the bottom of the bottle even though it was settled when I poured it.

Pallet: Watery and thin, slight fruit builds in, but is quickly overshadowed by oak spice and rye that is then dominated by a smokey char.

Finish: Char stays around for a while giving way to a slightly unpleasant astringency. The finish is very short. 

Notes: I would not suggest this whiskey to anyone... There are so many better rye options. Mitcher's, Knob Creek, and Baby Sazerac just to name a few. All three are better quality at or less than the same price."

2.0,"Really enjoy the Widow 10 yr old sourced Bourbon and had been wanting to try more of their offerings. So this one available for a reasonable price per pour and decided to taste it. This particular one is only aged for 2 yrs and distilled in Kentucky but bottled in NY. In the bottle the color is super light. I am not expecting much in the way of body.
Upon entry the rye spice and oak is immidiately evident. It's recedes on the mid palatte to reveal some dried fruit notes and then the oak driven finish fades quickly. As I feared it's a pretty thin body to boot. Its not the worst Rye I have had but for the $40 a bottle and $9 a pour price, it's a pass for me. Their Bourbon is Soo much better. 2/5"

3.0,Spicy with some sweet caramel. The longer it sits the better and sweeter it gets. Maybe some apple pie on the nose.   Short finish. Decent but wouldn’t buy.
4.0,green cinnamon caramel apple
4.5,Very mild rye. Easy to drink and extremely affordable. The flavors are muted but I get a mild nutty flavor.
4.0,"hint of spice but notes of apple, really nice rye"

3.0,"This whiskey has a clover honey color, and thick watery legs dribble down the glass.

The nose is green and fruity starting out with light nail polish, green pine, green apple, dill, and sawdust.

The palate is thin, dry, and fruity namely with apple and pear, fruit gushers, and strawberry.

The finish is short, hot, and tangy with a taste of  mango."
3.75,"The nose is not full of surprises, with apple, cinnamon and light oak. Use of applewood in the aging shows throughout with tart apple on the front of the pallet and warmer, baked apple on the middle and back of the pallet. A few sips brings out a touch of orange and more cinnamon. Noticeably younger with a softer finish than you might expect from a rye. Regardless of these late notes it remains heavily apple-forward throughout, limiting its complexity."
3.75,Short finish with Apple notes.  Not bad for a younger bottle.
4.5,"(Total Wines Store Pick - Single Barrel) This is an excellent rye.  Smooth and bold, coats the mouth with a spicy long finish and leaves me wanting more."
