2.5,"Ah Glencadam where have you been these last 18 years......not in good quality casks that's for sure. Sweet honey and vanilla on the nose, palate doesn't have a lot going on for it. The favour is faint and quickly over powered by the alcohol. This is going to have to be a 2.5. I expect more from 18 wasted years."
