3.5,"I'm relatively early into my Whiskey journey, so take my opinion for a grain of salt; but I really love this stuff.

I was feeling guilty about drinking so much of my wife's 'special occasion' Single Malts (namely Glenlivet 12), so I decided to look into the basic budget blends for a more suitable (and economical) 'everyday' drinker.

I decided to grab a bottle of Teachers after finding out about the high percentage of Single Malt used in the blend, seeing the relatively good reviews, and of course being enticed by the now confirmed to be 'too good to be true' price. 

My nose and palate are still fairly undeveloped so I won't attempt to provide too much detail here. Teachers has a pleasant buttery mouthfeel, a good balance of 'smokey' and 'sweet' flavours that are present without dominating the palate, followed by a delicate warm finish. Think 'eating honey roasted nuts around a smouldering campfire'. 

A very respectable strong 3.5/5 (value factored in)."

3.0,"Nose - dry wheat and grain doused in vanilla extract.  Orange rind, almond, sour cream, sugar.  Approach is soft and slowly develops into sweet vanilla, followed by faint cinnamon and then salt and smoke.  Finish turns slightly nutty (peanuts), and then becomes just a tad bitter.  For a blend that is priced so well I find this one of the best values out there.  Always worth keeping some on hand."

3.0,"Nose: Nice malt with strong vanilla. Hints of salt and fresh sea air on the back.

Taste: Nicely warm and malty with notes ofcinnamon. Hints of peat.

Finish: Robust, bit spicy and a bit blendy, but hints of smoke and roasted malt manage to hide the blended feel.

Balance: For a blended whisky, good stuff! In overall – decent whisky. The usual watery finish of blended whiskys is very minimal in this case."

3.0,"Nose: Peat, sherry, honey, vanilla and some citrus. Also, further into the smell, some not so attractive synthetic notes.
      Taste (needs a few drops of water!): Peaty and peppery. Traces of mint and chocolate. Quite nice. 
      Finish: Medium long with pepper, chocolate and cereal but also some bitterness at the end..
      All in all a very nice (for the price) everyday, peated dram! Good value at DKK 139 / EUR 18.50 (less than half the price of Johnny Walker Black Label)."
3.0,A good starting point for Scot whisky it's sweet modesty peaty but has a bit of a bitter medicine after taste takes away from it but somehow it's creamy and that blends it all together 6.5 out of 10

The mouthfeel is a tad wishy washy, almost as if it’s been watered down (which at 40%, of course it has). And the finish just isn’t quite what it promises on delivery - just slightly insipid. Can’t grumble for the price though. A great drink."

0.5,"Nose: Barely perceptible - lighter than either Cutty Sark or J&B. Nothing but ethanol with the faintest wisps of generic ""whisky"" aroma.

Palate: Hah! You call this a palate? I call it the taste of regret. Once again it's just ethanol with some faint whisky-ish flavour. It's like someone took a bottom shelf scotch and watered it down with industrial alcohol to the point where you can hardly taste anything.

Finish: Mercifully fleeting. Faintly sour, metallic and bitter with no discernible character at all.

This stuff may have 3 year old grain whisky at the heart (well, it has to, doesn't it?) but its personality has devolved into nothing more than ""essence of dead cask"". It is a huge disappointment and a mere shadow of its once powerful self.  There was a time when this had a bold and assertive smoky character from start to finish and it was my affordable mixer of choice, but sadly those days are gone.

A few years ago the brand was purchased, along with several other properties, by Beam Suntory who immediately changed the blend, the packaging and the character of the whisky. The words ""Distilled, blended and bottled in Scotland"" once appeared proudly on the label. Now it just says ""Product of Scotland"" which infers that it is shipped in bulk and bottled at the market destination. I'm giving it half a star on the assumption that it doesn't contain methanol.

UPDATE: Re-reviewed 11May18. I took the risk and bought a bottle of this a year after my initial review to see if it had improved at all. It has not, in fact it has deteriorated. In comparison to this, Johnnie Walker Red is nectar.

One last note: I know from experience that there are blends that are much worse here in Australia than overseas - presumably we don't actually get the real McCoy in these cases. Grant's, Black Bottle and others are like this so it's possible that Teacher's might be alright in the UK but appalling over here.

""Very Poor"" : 0.5 stars."

3.5,"Great peat-smoked character. Definitely a go-to for anyone interested in Islay scotch, but can't justify the spend for say a Laphroaig Quarter Cask. The only downside is a bitter aftertaste, not sure if this is due to artificial coloring, or what?"
3.0,"Teachers is nothing spectacular, it won’t blow your socks off or introduce you to some new and wonderful flavours you’ve never experienced before. What it will do though is give you that delicious smokey peat flavour at a price you don’t mind bringing to a party/BBQ. It’s the bud light of peated whiskey.

The nose is pleasant enough, smoke peat and some bacon. The palate is a little one note, the consistency is a little watery, and the finish was short. For less than half the price of Highland Park 12 or Laphroaig 10, I can’t really complain."

Finalização: curta. O defumado é a característica mais evidente, mas ainda sim muito curta.

2.75,"This is a budget blend that divides opinion. Ive read this is bottom shelf rot gut scotch. Ive also read this is a great scotch for the money. Im with the second group, this is a solid value. High malt ratio of 45% with Ardmore as the core plus 86 pf. Poured neat, nose has some peat but not strong like an Islay, its subtle but present. Notes of malty honey, distant fruit, buttered bread dough and sweet wood. The weight and heft are very surprising at this price point($25 for a handle 1.75). Creamy mouthfeel leads to palate of nice thick sweet malt, light peat smoke, toffee and some barrel char. Finish is some lingering mild smoky peat and good amount of oak and char with toffee and malt. More flavor than you would expect from a low price blend. Seriously this does not taste like a cheap scotch, its quite good(for the $). Yes it does have some grain note detriment but it is a blend so some is normal. It runs a little hot with some edge but is not an issue. Not complex but has lots of flavor, rare peat influence and plenty of malt. Huge bang for the buck and recommended............79/100.......value factors into score but this blend can stand on its own. It blows away JW Red and Dewars for about half the $$..This is the Ezra Brooks of scotch blends."

The first taste is salt, with a mellowed out Werther's Original, followed by salt and vanilla. A perfect rhyme between the aroma and the flavor. 

The finish is pure candy: molasses, syrup, butterscotch. This is a confection in a dram. Not complex but if you have a sweet tooth you could do a hell of a lot worse."
