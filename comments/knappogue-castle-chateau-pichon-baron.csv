5.0,"Here we've got the first of the entries in Knappogue Castle's Cask Finish Series. I did the Marsala finish a few weeks ago, which greatly impressed me. This time it'll be French Oak.

Keep in mind that all 3 releases are 12 years old and bottled at 46% ABV. This is one of 1100 bottles, which is 100 less than the Marsala. On to the tasting.

Nose: Ripe strawberry and sweet marshmallow pop out of the glass. Golden raisin with a bit of apricot, cranberry, and plum. Some cola and a healthy dose of vanilla, toffee, and malt. I get an Irish soda bread which I also feel like I got on the Marsala cask, but couldn't place it at the time. And of course, plenty of oak. It's worth noting I get none of the classic Knappogue Castle green apple. Very nice, nonetheless.

Palate: Fruity and tart. Red berry/fruit all day. Cranberry, raspberry, strawberry, red apple, red/purple grape. Raisin as well. Sweet and tangy. Somewhat similar to a sherry cask-finish but distinctly unique. Less velvety and more oily. There is also pear, honey, malt, toffee, vanilla, and a touch of caramel. Almond and walnut. Orange peel. Also some cinnamon and oak spice. Brilliant.

Finish: Raspberry, cranberry tang out of the gate. Followed by some orange citrus, then more neutral sweet notes of caramel and toffee. Finally, cinnamon, baking spice, fine oak carry this to its conclusion for what makes for a medium-long finish.

This is unbelievable stuff. I'm glad I got one just before it disappeared, yet very sad to know that I won't be getting it again. It's probably the best Irish whiskey I've ever had, and is easily one of the best whiskies I've had. It tows the line between dangerously easy and remarkably complex. It takes a great base stock and ages it in what are obviously the highest quality barrels.

5/5. I give it the slight edge over the Marsala finish, though I still need to do a side-by-side comparison. If you do happen to see this one, buy on sight, though it's safe to say that this is all gone. Looking forward to the Barolo cask to wrap up my review of the Cask Finish Series, Phenomenal stuff here."
