2.0,Creamy Buttery Toffee Goodness upon opening 4/5. After opening up for a month it changes to straight Dill Pickles 1/5.  Drink it quick or be prepared to hate it....

4.0,"I have to thank a friend for this tasty pour.  Remus might seem unassuming at a glance but it reveals that MGP (love them or hate them) knows what they are doing.
Nose: Sweet perfume of florals wrapped with tobacco and that familiar vanilla hint.
Taste: madicinal meets dried fruits, sweetness that leads into baking spices such as nutmeg, cinnamon and a touch of peppercorn.
Body: medium rich oily texture that coats the mouth, slight tingle towards the front.
All together a very enjoyable aged spirit. The flavor and texture carry enough punch that I come back for 2nds.  Keep drinking my friends... Skol!"
4.5,"Remus Repeal Reserve ticks off everything that you would want in a Premium Bourbon!!  Flavor, balance, finish; all at a solid 94 proof.  This is a well crafted, and blended high rye bourbon!!  With many Bourbons costing much more than this these days, Remus Repeal Reserve becomes a bargain!!  Well done!!  My score was 92"

4.0,"Remus Repeal Reserve was first released in November of 2017 by MGP. For anyone who is not familiar with Midwest Grain Products, they are probably the largest supplier of bourbon and whiskey for brands that do not distill, or non-distiller producers (NDP's). If you read the label on a bottle and it states ""distilled in Indiana"" then chances are it came from MGP. The Indiana distillery used to be owned by Seagram's and came into the hands of MGP in 2011 where it continued to be run strictly as a producer and contract distiller for other brands until recently.
The George Remus brand was acquired by MGP in 2016 from Queen City Whiskey LLC out of Cincinnati.
Looking at the bottle label, it has a very ""Great Gatsby"" feel to it for a reason. George Remus was a bootleger during the Prohibition and happened to hang out at the Seelbach Hotel in Louisville, Kentucky at the same time as F. Scott Fitzgerald. It is believed that their interactions served as an inspiration for Jay Gatsby, the main character of the book.
Remus Repeal Reserve I is a blend of two different mash bills distilled in two different years. 50% of the blend is from 2005 and 15% is from 2006. Both are 75% corn, 21% rye, and 4% malted barley. The other 15% of the blend is distilled in 2006 and is 60% corn, 36% rye, and 4% malted barley. This would make it at least 10+ year old bourbon. This means it was distilled before MGP fully acquired the plant and at the time the Master Distiller was Greg Metze, who is now is with Old Elk Distillery in Colorado (which uses bourbon from MGP that he himself distilled interestingly).
On the nose you get vanilla, kettle corn, burnt brown sugar, cinnamon, and honey. On the palate there's honey sweetness, charred oak, vanilla, and cinnamon that is quickly replaced by heavy black pepper spice. The finish is fairly long and spicy with banana bread flavor and sweetness at the very end.
Excellent bottle that is definitely worth the price tag in my opinion."
