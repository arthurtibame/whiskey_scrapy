3.75,Easy drinking light caramel taste. A little bland

4.25,"Great BP. We tasted it blind against ECBP A119 and neat in a glencairn and it was neck and neck. 

The Stagg Jr is definitely alcohol forward on the smell but the flavors were much deeper than I anticipated - I got more sweet than spicy but it was balanced out nicely with a deep woody flavor. It didn't have quite the mouthfeel that the A119 had but the flavors lingered for a long time.

I tasted it again and added a couple of drops of water to open it up a bit but IMO its best served neat."

4.5,"It’s like a certain cola company and Buffalo Trace conspired!

On the nose, very alcohol forward then opens up to cinnamon cherry cola. After breathing for about 5-7 min, vanilla and caramel make their presence known.

Palate packs a whooping with a great mouth feel that starts with decent alcohol burn and gives way to cinnamon, nutmeg and cardamom. The vanilla and caramel come through similar to the nose

The finish is long and strong with a decent Kentucky hug. Oak shows up in the end but just a hint. Like most, I put it pretty close to Stagg Sr with more alcohol and less oak and leather"
4.25,"This stuff is amazing. You are not missing anything with jr on this batch. Cherry coke...crazy mouthfeel. Had it at 4.75, and then I did a side by side with 1792 full proof. It's still excellent! That full proof was better imo. Which do you prefer, cherry coke, or banana nut bread? I prefer the latter."
4.5,Majestic nose. Enticing and welcoming. Hot Dr. Pepper cinnamon on the front palette and rivers of flavor on the back end!
4.5,I get Cherry Coke on the nose.  Taste is sweet cinnamon spice with a long spicy sweet oaky finish. The finish goes on for days.  This is delicious and I'm going to try to find another couple of bottles.

4.0,Sweet forward.  Alcohol burn less than expected for ABV
4.25,"Cherry and some ethanol on the nose. Big and bold on the palate with that cherry and vanilla prominent. Touch of chocolate and sweet caramel. The finish keeps it all going with oak, spice, and that 132 proof burn. This one packs a punch!"

4.75,"A fantastic barrel proof bourbon. Picking up cherry, oak and a slight chocolate like note on the nose. Decent coating on the palate with similar flavors on the nose coming through. Finish is medium-long but excellent. Well worth the cost if you are able to find it near retail."

3.0,"So this was either the most expensive bourbon I've ever bought or a great deal. 600 points for the RIGHT to buy, 1 point = 1 dollar spent in the store or a great 50 dollar bottle. I'm hoping BTAC is 1500 points but I'm betting 2500.

Nose - Cherry oak buffalo trace warehouse. Yeah I can't smell some of these Buffalo Trace products and not smell being on the ground there more than a decade ago. As it warms up and just sits out it gets super super sweet.

Taste - Cherry, oaked sweetness, vanilla, more cherry, caramel.  Oh man, I'll be doing a blind ECBP and Stagg Jr soon. I might note it up and add it here. Bottom line is this is a perfect example of classic bourbon notes at an extremely high proof (I think this is the highest proof since the first release). I'm not wowed and I didn't expect to be. It's just awesome quality bourbon that should be available and on the shelves but the bourbon boom or buffalo traces marketing department have decided to make impossible for some parts of the country to get.

3.0 due to color, nose, proof, body, and just being darn tasty bourbon. Nobody who likes bourbon won't be happy with this one."
4.75,"Nose: cowtail, simply put
Pallet: heat up front, all the way through. Some dark berries, spiced oak, caramel.
Finish: long, chewy, and kills with vanilla and caramel."

4.5,"This whiskey has everything, tons of flavor with brown sugar, cinnamon, cherries and tobacco. Nose is slightly muted compared to batch 13. Nose and palate has too much ethanol, but I suspect both will improve with air time in the bottle. Fantastic whiskey!"

4.5,Complex. Smooth at first. Bold finish. Oily
4.75,"Deep, complex, smooth, with a good burn. Fantastic.

4.5,"I was able to find this bottle for MSRP so that makes it even better in my opinion. Nevertheless, this thing is pure cinnamon to me and in such a good way. I prefer my whiskey neat so I typically don’t add a drop of water to my bourbon but the high proof on this means one doesn’t hurt and it definitely opens things up."

5.0,Amazing. Super strong. Sip slowly
5.0,"Strong, bold and well balanced bourbon flavors. I need a back up right away. Favorite bourbon so far

N(4.75): luxurious and bold aromas. Bright cherries with vanilla right behind. Hint of cocoa. Cherry coke also comes out. Also got some type of bright candied fruit. 
P(5): mouth feel. Omg. Creamy coating all over. Cherry tart sweetness with a touch of oak in the mid pallet. Heavy vanilla cream from the mid to back. Smooth and well balanced. 
F(5): nice amount of heat. Got a hug without breathing fire. No need for water for me. The pallet flavors carries to the finish strong. Beautiful oak. Just enough of bitterness."
4.5,"BACKGROUND: Initially released in 2013, Stagg Jr. was intended to be the more readily available offspring of George T. Stagg, the highly-sought and much-coveted bourbon in the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection.  Its own immense popularity, however, has rendered Stagg Jr. almost as difficult to find as its predecessor.

Though it carries no age statement, internet resources indicate the uncut, non-chill filtered Stagg Jr. is between 7-to-9 years old while George T. Stagg spends about 15 years in the barrel.  

Both are made from Buffalo Trace’s mash bill #1, which is the same low rye mash bill used for the popular Buffalo Trace and Eagle Rare 10-year bourbons, and both are known for having unusually high, cask strength proofs.

The two expressions are named for George T. Stagg, a Union Army officer in the War Between The States who entered the distilling business after meeting Col. E.H. Taylor around 1877.  When Taylor suffered financial hardships, Stagg paid off his debts and became a partner in his distillery.

The two men’s relationship deteriorated over the next few years and Stagg eventually took complete ownership of the distillery.  He kept Taylor’s name on both the facility and the bourbon it produced, which resulted in a contentious and fractious lawsuit.  

After a court ruled against Stagg in a landmark decision over trademarks and naming rights, he rebranded the operation as the George T. Stagg Distillery, but today is is better known as the Buffalo Trace Distillery. 

Two separate batches of Stagg Jr., each with varying proofs, are released per year.  The Batch 12 that I sampled was released in the summer of 2019 and carries a proof of 132.3, or 66.15% alcohol by volume.

NOSE: The nose offers strong notes of pipe tobacco, cherries, maple syrup, oak, and leather, and it evokes thoughts of rich, decadent sweetness and rustic age.

PALATE: An explosion of flavors occurs with the first sip.  Chocolate covered cherries and toasted caramel marry with the pipe tobacco, oak, and leather noted above.  It is a complex and sophisticated palate, and despite the high alcohol content, there is little initial burn.  An oily and coating mouthfeel makes an already excellent experience even better.

FINISH: A strong kick of menthol reminiscent of a blast of Binaca breath spray joins all of the palate flavors in the finish.  Alcohol burn finally kicks in and results in a warming Kentucky hug.  The finish, as one would assume, is a long one.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: This batch of Stagg Jr. is completely pleasing on all levels, and its retail price of roughly $60 makes it one of the best values in bourbon.

Though I have not had the chance to taste it yet, online reviews indicate that Batch 13 may be equal to or better than the batch I was able to acquire.  I hope to have the opportunity to soon judge for myself."

4.25,The nose on this is so light for the proof. The finish might end on Sunday....  This is great. Save yourself some money and get this batch instead of the George T. It drinks lighter than the 130 plus proof.  No water needed. Sweet oak. Buy all you can and then some.

4.5,"Tabacco, leather, chocolate, just delicious.   Hard to find but worth the hunt.  soft on the palette, finish is smooth and lasts just the right length."
4.75,"Nose- Almond croissants, fruit punch, cherry, vanilla custard, ethanol, cooked fruits, icing sugar

Palate- Ripe fruit initially (raspberries, rainier cherries) wave of dry oak, spice, almonds, tropical fruits

Finish- Long, drying finish with notes of dry oak, tropical fruits and a light leather note 


Wow. Not only does this live up to the hype, it blows it out of the water. If you poured this blind into a glass and told me it was a $400+ bourbon, I would absolutely believe you. The nose is fantastic, full of ripe fruits and sweet sugary notes. The palate drinks way lower than the proof and is equally as enjoyable as the nose. The finish is, as expected, long and full of tropical fruits, oak and leather. Hell of a pour."

4.75,"Rich. Brown sugar. Sweet. Coats your mouth. Long finish, like very long. Mild heat for proof"
5.0,"Nose: Cherry Cola and Milk Chocolate Covered Almonds. Vanilla Extract pops as if you were pouring fresh Cream into Sugar as it Toasts in the pot for Caramel

Palate: Thin Chocolate covering strong Maraschino Cherries rolled in a Caramelized Creamy Mouth Coating of Sweet Butter. Oak Spice warms from the THICK, Hot Oily mouthfeel.

Finish: Oak Spice lingers and reveals a Cherry Pipe Tobacco dryness. Mild Clove

I can't say I've tasted more drams than the next guy has, but ffs Baby Stagg (Batch#12) is a miracle bottle. I'm halfway through this bottle and it makes me sad to think it will be gone some day.

(SUGGESTION): Acclimate your palate well, then add 2 drops water to a dram. Letting it sit and open is what suddenly allowed this whiskey to coat my palate in the strongest mouthcoat of hot butter and zero burn. Totally insane."

4.5,Doing a side by side comparison of this and batch 13. This one has a much sweeter nose and a little more fruit on the palate but packs a little bit more of a punch. Letting this one open up for 5 or 10 minutes really did it wonders but I think I give the edge to batch 13.

4.75,"Nose:
Cherry cola, butterscotch, vanilla, almond extract, buttery caramel, and sweet oak, a fair amount of heat but mostly in the background

Palate:
Everything from the nose translates to the palate, the palate is much rich than on the nose with almost a creamy texture, the alcohol tingle almost feels like the effervescence from actual cola

Finish:
A very long, cherry almond finish. This is one where the flavor goes on forever. One pour could last for hours.

Overall:
So much bourbon for the price. If this was even somewhat available it would be the best value on the market. It's definitely my favorite whiskey to date."

null,"Sweet like sugar cookie up front , bit of caramel, light  antiseptic spice, really mellow (surprisingly) then warms the body to the very bottom of the belly, over all very burbony, great for shoveling or snow camping"
4.25,Familiar Molasses and brown sugar on the nose.  On the palate molasses is right up front unmistakable and delicately fades to Vanilla with a playful amount of heat in the back that I looked forward to in every sip after.  The most distinct charter was how graceful this barrel proof was from front to back.

4.5,"Absolutely wonderful. Aroma is caramel and dark fruit. Perhaps fig or date.  Flavor was sense, the right sweetness and opens quite nicely.  Caramel and cocoa later turning to dark chocolate resonated with me.  Same dark fruit notes from the Aroma appear in the flavor with again with dates.  A drop of water opened this up nicely and had some additional spice notes and complexity come forward.  This was really nice."

4.75,"Apparently this is Batch 12. As far as I can tell, Buffalo Trace did nothing to indicate the Batch No. Luckily, distiller lists the ABV, so I was able to match them up myself. This is the little brother of the highly-touted George T. Stagg. Should be interesting.

Nose: Classic BT. Camarel, cola, cherry, Gala apple, leather, and vanilla. Some peach and honey sweetness as well. Even some carrot cake as well, which, though I've been finding this a bit more often, is still a rare note. Just a touch of brown sugar. I said cola earlier. I'm going to specify that as root beer here. There's some steak sauce and wood char. Extremely heavy on the oak. There is plenty of allspice, clove, and nutmeg behind the sweetness, but not a hint of ABV--impressive since this clocks in at 66.15%. Strong start.

Palate: Loads of caramel. By far the prevailing note. Also quite a bit of brown sugar. Milk chocolate as well, which is unique for a bourbon. There's some cocoa and leather. Plenty of oak. As brown a bourbon as I've ever had, if that makes any sense. Beyond that, there's some more Gala apple, carrot cake, vanilla.  A touch of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and clove on the back end. Doesn't add much to what I got from the nose, but the quality is consistent.

Finish: Until this point, this was very good, but not quite great. Chocolate, graham cracker, caramel, and vanilla. Tons of oak. Cinnamon, allspice, clove, nutmeg. Blistering heat on the first sip. As time passes, it becomes tempered, and very refined. Interestingly, the chocolate is initially a mint chocolate; yet, it transforms to milk chocolate when given time to breathe. It's among the longest finishes I've had. It's rare that a finish could add so much to whiskey, but in the case of high ABV whiskies like this, it is always worth factoring into the score. Phenomenal.

When I purchased this, it boasted the highest ABV of any whiskey I'd ever had. Since then, it's dropped to number 2. At any rate, that's a lofty accomplishment. What impresses me about this one is that it retains the core attributes of the Buffalo Trace profile while living up to its status as an overpowering behemoth.

I choose the Col. Taylor SB over this. The Weller 12 as well. Two of the finest whiskies I've ever had. This one is on par with Elmer T. Lee--for completely different reasons. The latter is a refined and eloquent expression of the BT profile. This one is a bold, brash, and bombastic embodiment of Buffalo Trace's potential. I've enjoyed this one very much. It's a monster of a whiskey, but offers enough complexity where the ridiculous ABV cannot detract from the quality. 

BT does a poor job of distinguishing these expressions with their labeling. But they do a stellar job with everything else. Compare the ABV with the information online. If you can match it up, I highly recommend this beast. Superb stuff."
4.0,One of my fav ! Love this and the flavor ! The heat is nice !
