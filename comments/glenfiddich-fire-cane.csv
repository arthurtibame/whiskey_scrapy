4.0,"Nose: Light smoke, juicy citrus, slight toffee, chocolate, horchata even. 

Taste: Butter, apple, molasses, waxy raisin, and almonds. A surprising amount of wood, spice.

Experience: Putting out the fireplace after a Christmas party. Dull spices and sweets line the air from events of the night. They mingle with some smoke but just that of an extinguished flame, or your grandfather's pipe  residue. 

Bonus: pour a small amount of a peated Scotch and another speyside. Take turns smelling one then Fire and Cane you will find that the smoke will disappear or get stronger based on what you smell before. Fun!"
4.0,"Aroma: the aroma on this particular Scotch was very toasted coconut forward with some mellow peat notes that were still prominent behind it. Not much in the way of you know stone fruit or malt, or really anything else besides that coconut aromatic on the front.

Flavour: akin to the aromatics on this particular Scotch the palate was also very coconutty, with forward notes of peat. But while it is a peated expression from Glenfiddich, the peat was not overpowering in any way shape or form. In fact on the palate it was mellowed out and it was almost as if it was under a layer of water so you could taste, but you weren't getting the full smokey/BBQ-y taste."

3.0,overall pretty good but doesn't stand out. it has a bit of heat. It is a decent time with friends kind of drink. it won't take over the conversation kind of drink. There is a little bit of sweet that shows up near the end and disappears quickly.
3.0,"I’ve heard it compared to a baby Ardbeg Uigeadail and I’d say that’s about right.  At half the price, it’s half the strength and half the flavor.  Not sure that’s a worthwhile trade off, but it won’t be bad for a daily sipper.

The peated barely they use comes from Balvenie and they began distilling it in 2003 when Balvenie began its peat week experiments (think of it as a collaboration I guess).  This dram definitely has some of that 15 year old peated scotch, but it’s been cut with a bunch of younger cheaper material.  It’s a pretty good value for what it is; the rum finish adds some great astringent burnt brown sugar, but I wish the peat smoke was stronger.  A higher abv version would have been a treat, though even as is, it’s probably my favorite ‘fiddich so far."

On the palate, I get the classic Glenfiddich flavor profile. Apples and toffee.  The presence of the rum casks are very prominent at this point. On the finish, there is a resurgence of peat flavor. It's an abrupt but welcome shift from the cool, sweet cane to a fiery finish. Definitely worth a buy, especially at the price point. Glenfiddich delivers on this one"

5.0,For the price this is an excellent blend of light smokiness with the standard glen experience.  I don’t get much if any of the rum sweetness.

4.0,"I would never peg this as Glenfiddich blind, but I do enjoy the woody peat smoke aroma that gives way to reveal sweet rum toffee.

4.0,"Let me start with, I really like this scotch. Some may think it is hokey, but its interesting and different. The nose is mellon, honey and a hint of peat. The tongue, blew my mind. First time I tasted it was after eating something sweet, all I got was peat and smoke. STRONG peat and smoke. Then I tried it after a glass of 8yr old Lagavulin, and it was incredibly sweet. I encourage everyone to experiment with this interesting scotch. I love the inventiveness of the Experimental Series."

4.0,"Saw this at my local liquor store for $49.99 and had to give it a try. 

I’m a big fan of Islays like Ardbeg or Laphroaig so I figured this would be interesting. The nose is peaty but nowhere near the intensity of the more traditional Islay scotches. It had a great smoky taste and could easily be mistaken for an Islay at the first sip. But after three or four sips, the peat taste recedes significantly and the dark sweetness of the rum casks comes out and it transforms to a rich highland/speyside fruitiness. 

Definitely an interesting and dynamic whiskey and I would certainly recommend it."
3.75,"This is an interesting experience- there is smoke right from the start, but it isn't intense.  The rum character is present, but not overwhelming.  It does, somewhat overpower the gentler malty notes, but you can find them if you look.  There is a bit of molasses with a slight alcohol burn at the end.  Definitely drinkable and it's different.  Good, but not great - 3.6, current distiller score is pretty reasonable.  I'll need to drink more to determine if I want to keep this on hand or not once this bottle is empty."

4.25,"Nose: Beautiful bouquet. Oil, fruity notes lead by papaya, rubber, lightly charred and spiced oak, vanilla, fresh peat.

Palate: warm spice, leather, burnt sugar, caramel apple, orange zest, rubber, charred oak, fresh smoke. The more I drank the more the bold and spice mellowed and toffee started to surface. 

Body: Oily (not as quite as nose suggests), full bodied, warm, bold, a little harsh upfront, but smooth finish.

Overall: The smokey scotch peat works masterfully with the spice and warming on the initial sips. I would say the ""fire"" is not represented by the typical scotch smoke in the backdrop, but more the spices and warmth that play infront. The ""Cane"" undoubtably adds the great array of rum characteristics that add piquancy and mellow sweetness. Lots of complexity, personally thinks it works well but could see some drinkers getting lost. Being more of a rum drinker dabbling in scotch, this is a fantastic bridge between the two."

Color added

Nose; Potent peat smoke, but closer to a Highland Park heather-type peat, not Laphroaig; classic Glenfiddich green apple; some other dark sugary sweetnesses.

Palate: Creamy, toffee and marshmallow sweetness from the rum finish; smoky; apple way in the background; thin-medium viscosity and mouthfeel.

Finish: Too short. Lingering hint of sweet molasses; toasted marshmallow and caramel apple way at the end.

Value: $45-60. $45 USD is a ""Sure, I'll roll the dice;"" more than that is pushing it.

Final thoughts: Fairly enjoyable stuff and I like that Glenfiddich tried something new and thought outside the box. Ultimately an interesting and not super complex dram,  but seem to try and act like it is, which leads me to think it could have been amazing with more age.

3/5 stars. Recommend trying or buying a bottle at a good price."

4.0,"info: la 4e édition expérimentale de Glenfiddich (Les autres sont : IPA, project XX et Winter Storm). Une version sans mention d'âge vieilli en ex fut de bourbon et le grain est tourbé. Le liquide est ensuite fini en fut de rhum quelques mois. Un embouteillage à 43%. Il est plutôt rare que Brian Kinsman nous invite dans un univers tourbé. N'étant pas un fan fou de Glenfiddich, cet aspect inhabituel à piqué ma curiosité. 

Nez: Nez sucré, tourbé et mentholé. 

Bouche: Tourbe sucré. Du sucre brun. Des herbes... de la menthe? Doux. Particulièrement doux. Cette tourbe n'est pas agressive. Elle est légère et amène un sucre avec elle. Probalement le sucre du fût de rhum. C'est bien exécuté et on ne sent pas de distance entre les champs aromatique différent. C'est harmonieux. Fire & Cane, ça lui va très bien. Une tourbe légerte... que l'on pourrait presque qualifier de fumé, en fait. Des notes de caramel salé, d'agrume et de bois de chêne. Comme la plupart des éditions de Glenfiddich, la dilution est perceptible. 

Finale: Moyenne. Fraiche, sucré et fumé. 

Overall: j'aime bien. Je ne suis pas en amour avec cette édition mais, c'est bien exécuté et équilibré. Le jeu d'arôme est original et complexe. c'est une belle expérience et je suis content d'y avoir gouté. Je ne vais pas courir allez m'acheter une bouteille mais, j'apprécie particulièrement mon verre. D'une certaine façon, c'est le Valknut de Glenfiddich. Une sorte d'aventure en dehors du champ aromatique habituel de la distillerie afin d'explorer ce que l'on peut faire avec du grain tourbé. Il ne tombe pas non plus très loin du Valknut mais, je crois que je préfère le jeu original de celui-là pour son rapport qualité prix. Ce qu'on peut lui reprocher? En fait, les deux sont trop dilué à mon goût et celui-là l'est définitivement trop pour lui faire mériter une excellente note. 87% pour le goût trop léger et dilué mais bien exécuté, agréable et original."

1.5,"Sample provided by @PBMichiganWolverine. Thanks!

Sample rating: -1 (this is on my minus infinite to plus infinite scale where glenfiddich 12 is the zero)
The full bottle is 40-55 USD. That earns a 1.5 / 5 stars

Tried this on its own and didn’t like it. What do you do with a whisky you don’t like? Try is side by side with a similar average whisky to make the average whisky look like a superstar. 

Balvenie 14 carribean cask gets a +2 in comparison. 

This glenfiddich fire and cane is more like swimming pool water and cane. The syrup and sugarcane from the rum finish is alright. But the weakly peated immature spirit is swimming pool water on the last day of summer. And there is no fire. Where are my spices? The finish is weird enough to be more memorable than a standard glenfiddich, but dangerously close to tasting like trash. 

Tasting a Balvenie after tho... I might finally kill the bottle after over a year."

4.25,"Finally...a ‘fiddich that’s reasonably priced and good?!?  At about $50/ bottle, this is a great buy.  It’s a departure from the traditional ‘fiddich in that it’s lightly peated.  It’s a bold departure, marrying a bourbon matured whisky with a peated whisky, and then finishing it in Caribbean rum barrels.  The peat is different than what we’d normally see in Islays.  This peat is from Speyside.  So, you have less of that phenolic character, and more earthy instead.  The peat level is only 5ppm, which is minor compared to what you see in Ardbeg ( 50ppm).   So you’re getting a light earthy soot, combined with a sweet aftertaste from the rum.  I found this incredibly well balanced, doing the tightrope really well between fruit and light faint smoke.  If you go in expecting an Islay style, you’ll be disappointed.  But go in acknowledging what a departure this is from the traditional ‘fiddich, and extremely attractively priced at $50.  Solid well recommended buy.  Just don’t expect a peat monster or Islay wannabe.  It’s something else and unique."

3.5,"I recently made a 3 bottle trade with a fellow Michigander I met on the Snupps app and he threw in a sample of the recent peated NAS, Fire & Cane from Glenfiddich. It’s a peated malt (rare for Glenfiddich) that was finished for several months in Caribbean rum casks. Bottled at 43% ABV, chill filtered and has colorant added making it an amber honey. 

The nose starts off fairly sweet with honey, lemon citrus and vanilla custard. A light peat (heavy for a ‘Fiddich), but it’s a welcome addition as it adds balance to the sweeter notes and also adds that much more depth. Slightly ashy/sooty with cereal malt, barley sugar and a bit of butterscotch, undoubtedly from the rum casks. Orchard and tropical fruits, apricots, peaches and grilled pineapple. Young and pretty simplistic, but bright enough to hold your attention long enough appreciated it. 

The palate begins with moderate peat, somewhere around the Highland Park level, enough to be considered worthy in my book. Ashy lemons, vanilla custard and malted barley. Apricots, pineapple and a little kiwi. Cinnamon & sugar, slightly floral, earthy and smoky. Again, a bit on the simplistic side, but not bad. 

A light to medium bodied mouthfeel that is creamy and a bit oily, mouth coating. 
The finish is medium long with peat smoke, light citrus and not much else. 

While this was nothing earth shattering as far as peated scotches go, I have to say it was a welcome variant on the otherwise traditional (and mostly boring) Speyside juggernaut that is Glenfiddich. Not complex and pretty much a 2 dimensional dram, but for the reasonable price of $50 you could do worse. However, for that much or $5 more I’d rather just buy a tried and true Islay 10 year old from Ardbeg or Laphroaig. Not a bad choice for someone still dipping their toes into the peated game. 3.5 and a thanks to Donald P. for the sample. 
Cheers"

2.75,"Settling down this Friday. It’s been some time since I actually sat and sampled.  Courtesy of @PBMichiganWolverine and my ample backlog of samples, deciding what taste is not a problem.  Just the thing we call time. 

The color shows as lightly golden.  

Peat is very detectable and forward, but doesn’t dominate the dram.  In the subtle peat, sweetness is all around: Vanilla pudding, honey, butterscotch, maple syrup.  Of course there is a mix of orchard and tropical fruits.  Peaches, pineapple, pears, dried apricots.  There is a slight youthful quality detectable to the nose which I would guess to be 8 or 9 years. 

In a oily, medium weighted body,  the youthfulness is also detectable on the palate which provides a edginess of cinnamon and pickled ginger. Amongst the prickly sensation, the sweeter side takes root.  Butterscotch, vanilla, sucrose, within a cereal.  As you chew, hold or swirl, the sweetness turns bitter leading towards the finish. 

That finish is lemon oil with charcoal or soot. The citric bitterness fades rather quickly ultimately leaving the palate dry, woody and sooty. 

All in all, an average with a nice bouquet but lacks a memorable or unique characteristics.  The rum finish adds a sweetness that provides some dimension to the body. However, It’s not one I would actively seek out.  Worth a try but maybe not worth a buy. [83/100][Tasted: 7/12/19]"

There is sweetness, although I've always felt that run finishes are nice but not as powerful as Sherry or port.  The finish goes from peat to a grapefruit bitterness.

Overall, I like it.  It's not perfect, and it tastes like the malt is still young.  But there are some nice things going on, and overall it works for me.  And the price is right - I picked up a bottle for $39."

Finish - Light lingering fruity smoke, apples, graphite, ginger tingle

Score - 70/100

Final Thoughts - This is a very inoffensive lightly peated malt. It's really targeted for the masses so the flavors aren't very strong one way or another and that's where I see the downfall of this one. It's a pleasant lightly peated malt, but it's not very interesting and the flavors are kind of muted. That being said, I can see this being something good to introduce to someone who has never tried a peated malt as a ""gentle"" introduction. Sadly I don't really get much of the rum influence, but maybe because it's the general ""sweet caramel"" flavors I get out of this one.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

On the palate there's honey and heathery peat which does taste different from the islay peat, more floral almost. The biscuit from the nose is now a chocolate chip cookie.

The finish is fairly long but mostly honey and doesn't really change."

Smoke carries well; although it's got the peat base taste, it really does seem to ride a sweet, light wave and get the smoky job done without overpowering anything. The malty flavor is a well rounded blend of the standard finds: cereal, honey, grass, sea. Speaking of the sea, there is a slightly salty finish, which really, really pairs well with the moderate smoke linger."
3.5,"Oily peat on the nose, beautiful rising mid palate, sweet, no peat on tasting. Nice complexity.  Orange peel"
4.25,"Toasty and sweet on the nose, which is matched by the palate as well. Bit of oak, and a lot of caramel. It’s almost a bit earthy, which is odd considering it isn’t pleated. Little pepper on the finish. Goes down very smoothly, definitely a fan."

3.25,"On a beach a night with a dry warm breeze which carries soft billows of campfire smoke and dark apples. Eating spiced rum cake.

Nose: Soft but forward Smoke with slight toffee
Palate: Initially strong highland peat, dark baked apples and sugarcane which bring a hint of sweetness
Finish: Moderate smokiness which is short and abrupt"

4.5,Classic glenfiddich nose with a slight peaty smoke note. Palate is light on the entry and then comes the smoked meat flavors.  Like most peated scotch this one sticks around for awhile on the backend.  I really enjoy this.  It’s prolly not for everyone but the nice sweetness of the rum finish and smoke of the peat make it a interesting dram none the less.  Cheers!

3.75,Considering this was the 1st dram I tried on day 2 of Dramfest when I was feeling rough as guts I quite liked it. The peat marries well with the casking

4.0,"Can you taste the fire or the cane? It is an interesting balance. I taste more so peat, but caramel on the nose. A nice drink."
3.5,If you've ever ridden Spaceship Earth in Epcot and are familiar with the burning of the library of Alexandria scene this smells and tastes exactly like that smell very good
3.25,"Sniff sniff... can't quite put a finger to it but I wanna say slightly burnt brown sugar, slightly roasted peanuts. The taste opens up sweet and nutty and a hint of dark chocolate -- I also tasted sweet beets, seriously. But that quickly vanishes and replaced by spice... followed by a looongg finish of, guess what, spice. I gotta be in a good mood, or something, to buy it again. But I won't shy from it if a friend is serving it for free."

3.25,"Finally got a bottle of Fire & Cane.  Wanted to compare two rum finished whiskies, so I compared the Balvenie 14 Caribbean Cask with the Fire & Cane, interesting match.
 - On the nose, the Caribbean Cask (CC) was sweeter and mellow.  The Fire & Cane (F&C) was strong, with a slight smokey influence in the background with fruits like orange... something citric.
 - On the palate, the CC was sweet... honey, sugary; the F&C was smoke with pears and a little sweetness, but nothing like the CC.
 - On the finish the CC was smooth and light; the F&C was strong, medium last, but it makes you remember that you are drinking a scotch whisky.

Overall I liked them both.  I will drink the CC maybe after dinner, but if I want to relax while watching an action movie, then the F&C will be the choice."

4.0,"Slightly smoky on the nose with a bit of ethanol at the end. Taste: vanilla, caramel, honey with a creamy mouthfeel. Smoke is very subtle, no peat. Would've liked it to be a bit more smoky and peaty, but still an enjoyable dram.

Edit: drank it again after I had a Redbreast. Peat was much more prevalent this time! Lovely! Earthy, peaty tones followed by a malty, vanilla sweetness. Smoke is still a bit too subtle for my taste though."
4.0,"The fourth experiment of Glenfiddich, is quite a ride, and makes me feel like this distillery can't say they have a defined profile. Actually Glenfiddich doesn't have 2 malts alike or similar. From fruitiness, to chocolate, to peat (in this case), one can never truly know the DNA of glenfiddich. 

Bottled at 43%abv.

On the nose, a lot happened here: Peat, burning Hay; Feels more like a Highland Park than a Glenfiddich; Citric aromas start to develop. There was this orange juice called ""Tang"", it smells exactly like that.  Mild heathery peat, Definitively orange. Brown sugar; Sugary notes but not cane as expected. Very pleasant, orange sugar, heather profile.

After first sip citric flavors intensifies. Lemon. Grapefruit. All this on the nose.

On the palate, Ashes, Oak hotness, Heather.
It is like a highland park. Artificial orange.
Cinnamon spice. Rum. It is a little watery at the beggining of every sip.
Orange peel.

Aftertaste is not that good. Ashes. Cinnamon. Spicy short - medium finish. 

Overall, 83 over 100 for this strange but good Glenfiddich. Nothing to die for, it goes for $45, which is a proper amount for it."
4.0,easy to drink and smokey flavoured. kinda smells like antiseptic though
