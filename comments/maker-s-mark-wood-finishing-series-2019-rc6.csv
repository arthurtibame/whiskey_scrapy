4.0,"I've long been a fan of the Maker's line. So when they decided to put out their first limited-edition release, naturally, I was interested. Even more so considering it's actually a reasonably-priced, a rarity for LER bourbon. It's a stave experiment, true to Maker's spirit. Let's see what if MM can make a splash with its foray into one-off bottlings.

Nose: Huge cinnamon, oak, and leather right off the bat. Clove, nutmeg, and allspice. Quite spicy. Some caramel and milk chocolate. Toffee, red apple, cherry, banana, and a jammy/syrupy sweet note. Raisin and cranberry. Vanilla, brown sugar, and graham cracker. Coffee notes. Massive spice upfront, and with layers of heavy sweetness behind.

Palate: Big spice up front once again. Cinnamon, oak, clove, nutmeg, ginger, and allspice. Cherry, cranberry, raisin, fig, date, raspberry, and red apple. Caramel, vanilla, brown sugar, carrot cake. More of that jammy/syrupy note. Unripe banana, which I'm not loving. Dusty. Maintains some of the dessert sweetness from the nose, but not quite as much. Red fruit is turned up from 8 to 10, and the spice is still present.

Finish: Red hot. Cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and oak. Caramel, vanilla, coffee. Milk chocolate, brown sugar, and graham cracker. At cask strength, it's no surprise that this is a mighty long finish.

Solid effort. Good balance of dessert sweetness and spice and heat. Worthwhile purchase at $57. Is it really breaking ground? No. Would much prefer the Private Select, or even the 46 as a value. There are a few notes that seem off-putting with this one, but for the most part, it does work well together.

This one has grown on me. Initially, I wasn't a fan, but I've got to say, there are some pretty unique note combinations at work here. Overall, I like what I'm getting. Definitely not the best Maker's Mark by any means, but if you're curious and are able to spot of these rare bottlings, you'd do well for yourself to grab one of these. 4/5."

4.75,Makers 46 on steroids. Way too smooth for its proof. Lots of baking spices and vanilla. Smells almost like a rum. Lots of brown sugar. Taste makes me want to come back again and again.
3.75,"Sweet and spicy, subtle fruit and nice oak finish"
3.25,"Upfront let me say I’ve had the opportunity to taste many different Bourbons some great some less than desirable. Everyone’s palate, likes and dislikes vary. This Maker’s Mark Wood finishing series RC6 I would have to put in the middle of the pack. 
Nose is sweet and fruity with a hint of spice that fools the taste. 
Taste is slightly more complex from original Maker’s Mark. I get a quick fruity front end with a much longer complex floral tobacco with a hint of bitter. For my palate if I chose a Maker’s Mark I would have to say Private Select hands-down."
4.25,"After discovering Makers 46 a while back, I was intrigued by the wood stave finishing idea, since I loved the 46. I also have a Private Select bottle that has some similar qualities, (different staves). So the RC6 was high on my list to check out!

The nose has cinnamon, freshly baked bread, maple syrup, a little bit of red apple and dark stone fruit.

The palate has a thicker oily mouthfeel with cinnamon, oak, a little bit of leather and some dark fruit.

The finish is long with a decent, but welcome burn. It dries out the palate a little.

I like this one. It is noticeably different than my Private Select. I was thinking it might be closer to the 46, but I guess that’s what the cask strength 46 is for (I wish that was readily available). But I like what this has going on. I need to spend more time with it, but I’m enjoying it."
4.0,"Long awaited for a Kentucky boy... supposedly has been available at the distillery in Loretto for a month or so but this one showed up on a local shelf and promptly followed me home.

Warm, amber color in a glencarin.  The nose is rich and sweet with maple, butterscotch, orange peel, tobacco and toasted oak.  There’s really not a hint of alcohol.

Here goes... spice forward!  Cinnamon and the sensation of licking pop rocks.  It’s not a smooth wheater by any means.  The second sip is of course smoother with more vanilla, butterscotch and oak coming through with hints of allspice before a short dry finish.

Overall really pleasant.  Sitting here moments afterword I peel like I’ve licked a cedar plank.  There’s still a bit of tingle going on between the tongue and roof of my mouth and a maple sweetness from the throat and back if my nose.  

This is one I will have to put head to head with cask strength makers, which I recall having a much thicker mouth feel and more caramel sweetness.  This may be a bit more balanced, and I really don’t want a higher proof out of it.  There’s never an ethanol aroma but the chest certainly feels the proof.  

In summary - like eating maple pecan pancakes at a fall bonfire as the leaves crackle under foot of those running about.  Happy Autumn bourbon fans."

4.25,"Bright nose, with a lot of caramel and a bit herbalness. On the palate there is a ton of flavor. The toasted oak really shines through along with the bright fruitiness and heat from the high proof. It’s held together with the classic makers sweetness. Despite being hot on the palate, it is shockingly soft going down, with almost no heat at all. Way more interesting and complex than other makers products and definitely worth checking out, especially because it is a one time release."

By far the most complex makers I’ve ever tasted, I will qualify this review and say that I do like cask strength and really like 46, but not enough to buy bottles. This I thought was well worth the money, and offers a unique experience overall."

4.0,For 108 proof it is an easy drinker
4.5,"In short, phenomenal. I'm a big Maker’s fan and wheat fan in general. This tastes like all the best parts of 46 and cask strength put together.

The setup:
Neat in a Taylor'd Milestones Glass, rested for about 10 minutes

In the nose it instantly hits with Maker’s trademark fruit, vanilla and spice. As soon as it hits your tongue, faint bananas and apples explode along with vanilla and brown sugar. Incredibly smooth with a long complex finish. Get your hands on a bottle while you can."

4.75,"Neat. Neck pour.  I really like this nose.  Had this at a restaurant and was impressed.  First impression at home is strong too.  Deep vanilla and pepper up front.  Wet oak in the fall.  Deep caramel.  Decent amount of alcohol presence which comes across as spearmint.  Baking spices.  The riches, deepest Makers nose I have ever had. Far exceeds any Private Select I can recall.

Once again, rich mouth feel.  Really creamy and smooth.  Sugar and pepper on the tongue.  Rich raspberry.  Hits you with the pepper, vanilla and caramel all at once with a kick in the mouth.  Oak lingers like a dark chocolate on the legs.

Blown away by this Maker’s release.  I think this is their best release ever.  People are going to shamefully over look this because it is Maker’s."
4.25,"Aroma: Sweet Fruit and Fresh Oak

Taste & Finish: Fruit & Vanilla Sweetness Up Front with a Medium to Long Finish of Spicy Oak. Overall a really Balanced Bourbon!!

Thought it was a notch above the Maker’s 46 and Private Select."

3.0,"Full disclosure, I like Maker's.  However, this special release is a puzzle.  It is very ethonol and vanilla forward on the nose.  It is even heavier on the palate with vanilla and a strong ethonol aftertaste.  There are some lightly smoky notes but not what I was expecting given the idea and science behind the release.  The flavor is just not balanced in my opinion.  There are good notes in the pour, I just don't think they are working harmoniously together.  

This is another great Greensboro Buyers Club selection.  I knew what I was tasting, but I am certain if this were a blind taste, I would not have guessed Maker's.  After a splash, it had some of the trademark wheater' aftertaste.  With the heavy ethenol and the wheat finish, I would have guessed Rebel Yell 100.  My favorite of the Maker's is definitely the 46.  At $36-39 it's a great value with few flaws.  RC6 has more going on than basic Maker's, but at $60 to $65 in NC...??? I can't suggest it.  IMO, it lacks the premium extras one might expect for $60-70."

5.0,"What a phenomenal bourbon!

It hits every note I’m looking for in a glass of Maker’s Mark. The regular Maker’s is my daily drinker. I find the 46 a little overpowering with an woody taste. This has a vanillic taste that smooths it out. Perfect amount of heat."
5.0,"One of my favorite pours currently.  Starts off with a little heat, with hints of cherry on the front, dark fruit, apple, caramel, and some light oak on the finish.  A little bit of tannins in the finish as well. Great mouth feel and finish that lingers just enough for me to want another sip as soon as it ends. Upon having my first sip I immediately went out and bought a backup."
4.0,"Not usually a Maker's fan, but I'm really enjoying this. It has the soft wheat feel, but so much more body. I like a woody bourbon, and I'll be sad when my bottle is gone."

3.75,"750ml poured neat in Glencairn at home.  I candidly fear the oak on this one.  Here goes...

Nose is vanilla forward, with some honeydew and chocolate (i know, odd combo), strong peanut butter, and then alcohol heat.  Rich.  Taste brings on the spice and heat to the fore, with  more vanilla and peanut, some definite oak, and then black pepper ramping up.  Long spicy finish.  I like this, maybe quite a bit, but not something I foresee thinking of on a random night of considering tasting options.  I need to come back to this after a bit and see where I end up.  For now, good not great.  12/4/19."

null,"Nose: This is a fruit bomb. Similar in style to Maker's 46, but this tends to leans towards fruit notes of pineapple bake, strawberry jam, and underripe bananas. Sweet aromas of cool whip and confectionary sugar surface once the fruitier notes blow off. Then, in the background, green woodiness gives this a little more complexity. 

Palate: All these bright red and yellow fruits pop on the sides of your palate. The characteristic of this tends to be light on its feet, leaning towards a medium viscosity. The fruit notes turn into cream, but it tends to get a little spiky with the alcohol leading into the finish.

Finish: Actually a fair amount of spice rises towards the front of your palate. But, red fruit notes covered in white chocolate save the day and don't allow this to get too funky or harsh. Finish is about medium in length. Best way to describe this is fruity, spicy, and creamy.

Personally, I'd add water to this. As soon as I did, I got a much more complete picture of this bourbon. The water got rid of those alcohol spikes and spicy undertones and made it more cohesive in general. It became even more creamy and allowed those fruit notes to shine without interruption."

2.75,"So I'll start off by saying I am not a big Maker's Mark fan. I  really haven't had too many Private Selection picks that I was overly fond of and outside of the Maker's 46 I don't buy their products. This particular one intrigued me since it's their first new mass release since the Maker's 46. The fact that it's released at cask strength and features toasted oak staves. Let's dive into the tasting..

It's enters pretty softly for the higher ABV. Brown sugar offset buy toasted oak and grassy notes. Pepper and cinnamon show themselves with some golden raisins and more dry oak notes. Pepper on the medium finish. It's an odd but not off putting combination. 

If you are looking for Maker's Mark you won't find it here. They have succeeded in creating a unique and somewhat satisfying experience. Even at the Costco price I would call is a marginal buy. At the going rate of $75 it's a hard pass for me. 

Cheers all!"

3.5,"Neat; inviting sweet vanilla nose with notes of banana. Sweet vanilla flavor. Has a small touch of heat & oak on the finish.
My bottle is 108.7 proof."
4.0,"BACKGROUND: RC6 is the 2019 release in the series of Maker’s Mark Wood Finishing Limited Editions.  Virgin oak staves are seasoned for roughly 18 months and then toasted in an oven in order to impart various natural flavors when added to a fully-matured barrel of Maker’s Mark Cask Strength, which is then aged for an additional period.

Only 255 barrels were produced in the 2019 RC6 release, and their proofs range from 108.2, like the bottle I own, to 110.5.  Originally available for purchase only in the distillery gift shop, RC6 was distributed to stores as an allocated release in fall of 2019 and carried a retail price of $59.99.

NOSE: The RC6 nose smells EXACTLY like the sweet syrup in a can of fruit cocktail.  Try as I might to discern individual aspects of the nose, only a general note of fruit and sweetness comes through.  It is a pleasant olfactory experience, though.

PALATE: The same general fruit cocktail sweetness on the nose translates into a fruit bomb explosion on the palate.  A note of barrel char is nestled within the sweetness, as well.  Perhaps the only specific fruit note I can discern is some banana.  The palate is all at once both simple and complex…if that makes sense.

FINISH: The finish contains one brief flash grenade of pepper before quickly dissipating back into the overwhelming fruit sweetness that dominates this bourbon.  The finish is also very drying, which may be an aftereffect of the wood finishing.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: For many years, Maker’s Mark was considered a “beginner’s bourbon” by aficionados because of its sweetness and relatively low proof.  Many of those opinions change when, decades after its founding, the distillery began marketing its Cask Strength, Maker’s 46, and Private Select offerings.  

The RC6 is an impressive addition to the lineup and one that veteran bourbon aficionados will enjoy."

3.75,"Nose: Cinnamon apple and sweet spices, pleasant and warm.

Unfortunately the nose is the real high-lite for this one,  while it keeps the sweet heat going through the middle, and the cinnamon spice carries the day, there just isn't much else going on.  The dark caramel sugar notes hold up, but I'm looking for more here and just not finding it.  Note wise it's a bit on the bland side and may not even offer the variety that standard 46 is consistently great at delivering.   

The real question is if it is even better than standard 46 which consistently brings bang for the buck.   Expect to pay 50% more over normal 46 in most markets,  this just doesn't add up for me and that's sad, I was really hoping it wouldn't disappoint.  This one is on the low end of the proof at 108 and while not at all bad,  for the distillery known for it's great finishing I can safely say pass on it and try for better luck on another wood finish special.

Black pepper coming through after the first taste and that along with the maple and sugar bring bacon to the mind. Earthy with iodine and brine coming through. Hints of mint chocolate too. Chewing tobacco. Very interesting nose. 

Nice classic and complex medium finish. Compensated for the sometimes off-putting nose. 

Solid @ $53. Haven’t had the Maker’s 46 to compare @ $35 but I’d prolly pay the premium for this one given the huge breadth of scents and tastes.
