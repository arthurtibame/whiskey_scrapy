4.0,"Summerton Virtual Whisky Festival sample.

This is a nice peaty, sweet whisky.  Honey, berries and vanilla are the main notes behind the peat.  The aftertaste brings out a mild spiciness that I hadn’t really noticed before - cloves and chilli - but the main flavour is still that lovely warm, sweet peat.

This is a lovely dram.  I liked it enough to order a bottle during the festival."
