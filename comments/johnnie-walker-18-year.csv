4.0,"Stephanie's Distiller notes say it well. Smooth with rich sweet dried fruit, cereal, light charred peat, dry sherry. Great but I wouldn't necessarily pay for a bottle. Similar to Gold Label Reserve but much richer sweetness/sherry, more depth. $150 in Ontario."

Go ahead and be a fan boy of the atypical hard to find single malt stuff and let this one fly by- but wow- every time I pour a glass of JW 18 I’m just so impressed at the mature and delicious flavor profile- and the smoothness is like no other. This whiskey is nicely priced, and nicely done- and as a side note it has one off the coolest bottle designs in the business."

5.0,Awesome blend that I got for $72 on sale. The review massively overrates the peat and smoke though. This is similar to the green label but a tad sweeter and less smoky.

5.0,"unbelievably smooth. one of the best whiskeys i've tasted, for the price - not sure if anything could beat this. peat is rather undetectable - i would not call this peated blend (this is a very pleasant whiskey without aroma of burned rubber in a auto body shop on a rainy english day, like laphroaig). a must have in a collection"

4.5,Long time black label drinker and this was worth the try for sure. JW character with the maturity of an 18. Usually $70-80 in my local stores and it’s a great drink at that price if your a JW fan.
4.25,"NOSE: Sultanas, dried apricot, bitter orange marmalade, caramel, and incense smoke. Some wood notes too. Just a pleasant sweet fragrance that calls you in.

PALATE: Honey and fresh apricot, quite a bit of cinnamon spice, even chili, some malty cookies, then a dry chocolate finish.

OVERALL: Pretty incredible variety and balance of flavors for the money. Shows how blends can offer something unique that single malts cannot, in the combination of speyside, highland, and island notes."
4.0,"Single ice cube, fished out after 1/2 melted. Much smoother and opened up the fruit tones"
4.25,"Recommendation: I don’t know much about scotch but this was delicious. 

Taste:  Full of flavor that hits all at once with a smooth finish. Blended perfectly"

Well, color me impressed. Hard to be a single malt snob with blends like this around!"

3.5,"This isn't bad, even though it's a grain blend. I also agree with others that I'd rather be drinking this than Blue.

My main issue with both it and Blue is that both have a coldly scientific emphasis on being as ""smooth"" as possible at the expense of character or any other memorable qualities.  It is exactly what you expect if your goal is ""Smooth, inoffensive Scotch.""

which is not to say it's bad.  When you're in the mood for comfort without challenge,  this is exactly what you want, at half the price of their top shelf"

3.5,I first had this when it was called Platinum which I purchased at a duty free shop in India. Enjoy this one a lot.
3.75,"Clean with subtle smoke. Coming off a Laphroaig or Kilchoman, this is very mild. Not as syrupy sweet as a Macallan 18, but still much more than JW Black. Worth the premium, I’d say Yes. Overall very balanced. Not challenging, but complex enough to keep my interest."
4.0,"Fabulous blend. Yes, it’s smooth, but my goodness it’s got plenty of character too. Not surprising really if it has whiskies from 18 distilleries. Then again, I guess you could create pretty much any flavour profile you wanted with a palette like that. Nice dried fruit notes, spice and honey, grassy hint, with the signature Walker peaty note well to the fore. Good value too at around ¥7,000 / $65 / £50."

3.75,"The Distiller review hits this one right on the head. Initially it smells like the last few JW offerings I’ve tried. I actually felt like the JW Gold had more to offer on the nose and the front of the palate, but the FINISH on the 18 is amazing. Comes out of nowhere and suddenly it’s all nuts and dates and baking spices and oak and a LONG finish that gets warmer the longer it sits on my palate. I could get used to this!"

3.5,"Imagine if Macallan 18 had a more peaty brother with a little more attitude, a little less education, and a good deal more charm replacing the old-world breeding of ol' Mac. Spicy but crisp and clear, a little bit of honey-dipped apple and a little trace of iodine in the aftertaste, there are definitely flaws here (it doesn't stick with the mouth and the memory as much as it's initial sparkling impression would lead you to believe it will, and the lasting mouthfeel has the slightly medicinal aspect of a much cheaper spirit); but overall, this is an excellent and nearly exceptional whisky (if you overlook a peculiar, metallic aftertaste), a really superb blend of peat, spice, sweet -- all these factors are present, but don't overwhelm -- and a spring-water crispness.  In fact, I only rate it so low -- 3.5, instead of the 4 or 4.25 the flavor and experience really merit -- because, frankly, it is considerably overpriced."
4.0,"N - 92: Light smoke, dark chocolates, light herbs.

T - 90: Easy drinking, slightly sweet, very refreshing.

F - 90: Doesn't leave your mouth full of smoke. Short to medium length with light smoke and fruity.

Diageo is genius.  For those hardcore whisky fans point to Diageo’s alliance with HBO and Game of Thrones as a pact for profit only: just shut up.  Diageo is dumping its developmentally challenged crap whisky into collectible bottles to distract the tourists, collectors, and flippers; in order to protect people like me, and hopefully you.  There are now three different Game of Throne Johnnie Walkers; all fucking garbage fires.  Meanwhile, the Black 12 year old, the Green 15 year old, and the now colorless 18 year old (the spiritual descendant of Platinum), have all seen a bump in their quality.  Diageo has found a way to make money from their garbage, and increase the quality of their products for those actually looking for good whisky.

This blend is just so clean and pleasant.  I think I like it better than the last bottle of regular Blue Label that I had.  I do not care that this is artificially colored, chill-filtered, or served at 40%.  I hate this new trend among whisky reviewers of “checking boxes,” judging a whisky before it even interacts with your senses.  It’s wine snobbery madness!  I love that this whisky is 40% because it is delicious and I can have 3-4 ounces easily before I have an important decision to make about how the rest of the night is going to go.

This is a complex whisky.  It has every flavor on the wheel.  The nose is enormously fruit forward with apple cider and ripe red fruits like raspberries.  Deeper notes of malt and honey are present.  The palate is where the mass market appeal becomes obvious.  There is a confusion of flavors, designed to cancel out any distinctive notes, so you are left with this nicely balance, but nondescript, velvety liquid.  The finish is smokier than I remember the old JW Gold to be.  I have never tried JW Platinum.  The grain influence and the peat influence are the highlights of the palate and finish for me, because they are subtle and superbly integrated.  At 18+ years, the grain alcohol starts to give something positive that pure malts just don’t have, in the form of coconuts.

I had this side-by-side with Chivas Regal 18, and JW clearly is the winner, and the brand that respects its customers as connoisseurs. 

Score: * (Unforgettably good)

4.5,"Appearance: Looking into the glass of this 18 year old blend I notice it being the color of golden honey. Medium watery legs surf their way down the sides of the glass.

Nose: The first impression of this gorgeous nose is that it’s very fruity - heavy pear, cinnamon apples, ripe strawberry, banana, with the addition of fruity aromatic pipe smoke, some salty ocean surf, light vegetal peat, and some burned toast notes.

Taste: The palate starts a little hot and dull at first, but as it opens up, a dark chocolate and vanilla latte taste transitions into a green apple / strawberry note afterwards, followed by a salty peat note.

Finish: The finish is medium long in length with a surprising slight burn for the low proof, then a dry / sour green grape essence is left behind.

Thoughts: Sometimes the big brands like Jim, Jack, and Johnnie get a bad rap for being so big and sacrificing quality for quantity. To be sure, in some cases perhaps that may be the case; they are businesses after all, and they do want and need to make money. But in their portfolios of products where we may find some subpar items, there are in the lineup, gems that are a delight! This scotch, for example, is one such gem! I really recommend this one and wouldn’t at all mind having it again. Though both are great, the nose is better than the taste in my opinion, but this is a great blend! Johnnie Walker, well done and many thanks! Sláinte!"
