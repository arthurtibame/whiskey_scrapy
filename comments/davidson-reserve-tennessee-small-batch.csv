3.75,"Nose:  apple (red apple), little ethanol, for some reason getting gingerbread.  Good nose...more fruit than anything.

Palette: cinnamon, light fruit, little heat on the front, the finish is medium

This is an interesting whiskey.  You can tell it’s on the younger side, but tasty.  Little sharp due to the age, overall really good!"

Very front palated, not a ton of linger on the finish, but a lot of dancing up front. Wasn't sure what to expect from this bottle, but it has furthered my infatuation with tennessee whiskies. Totally unexpected. Fun bottle."

The nose has brown sugar and dark fruit and some baking spices.

The palate has brown sugar, a little corn, and rye and and some nice leather and cola. There is some ethanol on the backend.

The finish is medium in length with a little bitterness on the back end.

Overall, not bad. It hit some nice spots for me. Didn’t really like the ethanol part, but other than that it’s decent."
