4.0,"In the world of Irish Whiskies, The Quiet Man is unique in that it drinks more like a Speyside Scotch. Light and floral on the nose, it is sweet  then dry on the palate. The Irish comes through in it's lightness which lets the grain notes and the bourbon barrels in which its aged come through. The finish is long and lingering with notes of vanilla, grass and dried fruit. As Irish Whiskey continues to grow in popularity the category continues to innovate with unique flavor profiles and The Quiet Man continues that trend. Note: The Quiet Man will  be available in NY this Spring."

4.0,The description is spot on. I enjoy the lightness of it. Finish lingers on the back of the tongue.

3.75,"Slightly sweet but exceptionally smooth. Leaves a little to be desired on the finish, or lack there of, but overall for the price,it is a good buy. Would make a great daily drinker  for when I don’t want to break out the more expensive bottles."
4.0,One of the smoothest whiskys I've tried. Highly recommend.

3.0,"[3.17.18] My father-in-law brought this over to pair with my 10h smoked ham. No better way to celebrate St. Patrick's Day than that!

Simple whiskey, an easy sipper. Malty, sweet honey, hint of vanilla, mild proof (compared to my usual suspects). I don't pick up any spice at all. This whiskey is straightforward and a predictable win with anyone who likes to open up a new easy drinker. And yes, this was purchased within the U.S."

3.5,"Good aromas, nice bite."
3.75,"I noticed this is currently rated a tier higher than The Irishman Founders here at Proof66. This is a blend of 20% malt and 80% grain, whereas The Irishman is a blend of malt and pot still whiskies. I was intrigued as to why the rankings were seemingly reversed as to what one would expect. The answer is this is a very expert blend. (Some well done and balanced Scotch blends are superior to several single malts---think Compass Box.) Poured neat, this is a light golden amber. The nose is slightly sweet, honey-citrus, and a little floral. Taste is vanilla, oak, some spiciness and a glow of heat on the end. These flavors are also on the finish, and they linger! It seems to me the longer I hold this whisky in my mouth to enjoy the balanced interplay of flavors, the longer the finish lasts. I am certainly glad I gave this a try. The price is fair as well, $25 in my area."

3.75,"As blended Irish goes, this is VERY good! There’s a lot of pot still in this, the dark, biscuity and rich notes are a dead giveaway. The grain keeps it fruity and bright. Well crafted!"

2.75,Quiet Man is a good name for this floral and friendly dram. Freshly cut apples on a spring day. Not as full tasting as I hoped for. A nice alternative to Jameson if you're into it but not life changing. I'd pick Tullamore over this for the same price.

3.0,"Extremely faint on the nose. Most difficult whiskey I have had to pick up a nosing profile. Nose has vanilla and slight orange notes. On the taste it's wheat cereal and honey notes. The finish brings light toasted bread along with traces of cocoa and light oak. Thankfully it has a surprisingly longer finish than I expected due to the nose being so light, medium length. There are better Irish malts finished in bourbon barrels available for this price range, Powers Bushmills Jameson."

3.0,Quite pleasant. Not much of a punch. Aftertaste sits on the front of the tongue and towards the front of the roof of the mouth. A little bit of cling to the glass.

3.0,"Quiet is an appropriate adjective here, as I don't have a lot to say. It's solid, comforting, easygoing Irish blended whiskey...and a good one, at that, but there's not enough individual personality here to be memorable. I'd never say no to a dram, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it, either."

2.25,"The nose features floral scents with a heavy overlay of honey.  One may also detect grainy notes.

On the tongue, the whiskey has a light flavor of grains and fruit.  There is a rather medicinal aftertaste.  A few drops of water opens up a floral and fruity character to the drink."
3.0,"Appearance: Straw yellow is the color of this Irish whiskey. Thin and very viscous legs hang to the glass interior.

Nose: Floral and fruity is the first impression. Notes of honey, wildflowers, various grains, and strawberry tease my senses.

Taste: The palate contains notes of orange citrus, watermelon, a maltiness, some cinnamon, brown sugar, and Cherrios cereal. 

Finish: There is a little heat coming off from the swallow, and a note of red apples stays behind in the medium length finish.

Thoughts: I enjoyed this. It was a good representation, in my opinion, of a “traditional Irish whiskey.” Nothing extraordinary, but still really good. I agree with our friend Mr. Allison that a higher ABV would do this whiskey some good, but all in all, I'd recommend it. Sláinte!"
3.5,Ireland
4.25,Delicious Irish whiskey with a sweetish finish.
