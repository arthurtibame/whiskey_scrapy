4.0,Looks like I have the 2017 edition. Poured neat the color is very light but so is Ledaig 10. Nose has a farm like quality like a bucket of right from the cow milk. Of course there is smoke along with earthy malt and youthful wood. Palate is filtered smoke with malt and light French vanilla coffee. Despite the lack of aging it is very refined. Finish is long carrying the smoke and creamy malt/coffee with gentle non drying barrel. Pretty tasty indeed reminds me of Bunna Toiteach profile with the smoky vanilla. This of course means I now have to try their other expressions....darn........91/100......If you enjoy Islay this is worth it

null,"Pour 12/14 of 1/4 oz pours at a whisky club I'm in. Nice with notes of vanilla, citrus, caramel, peat, smoke, dried fruit, and pepper."
4.0,"On the nose, you can tell this is decently youthful. The fresh and young malt is apparent. This coupled with the peat smoke gives a unique bouquet compared to other Islay whiskies. It’s definitely an Islay whisky because of the nature of the smoke, but everything else is unique. The nose gives off the scent of fresh, green produce still covered in earth. The smoke is more like Lagavulin and Caol Ila rather than Ardbeg and Laphroaig. It’s very bright and less “bonfire-like.” On the palate, the smoke is very enlightening and bright and the fresh malt flavors persist. On the flip side, this is not what I would consider rich. The approach is simple and is no-nonsense. It comes, gives you what you want, then it’s on it’s way. It’s pretty light in mouthfeel. It’s still reasonably complex and delicious and pretty easy to drink for an Islay, but the richness isn’t as prominent compared to that of Lagavulin, Laphroaig, and Ardbeg. While not as rich, still a whisky I love drinking and tasting."
