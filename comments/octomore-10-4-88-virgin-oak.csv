4.5,"As soon as you open the bottle, the peat smoke fills the whole room - so you know what to expect from the first taste.

As a super heavily peated whisky, it’s probably not a surprise to say that the first taste is heavy on the peat, too.  However, there is a balance between the vanilla from the wood and the peat.

The peat doesn’t go away, but there’s a softness to it that mixes with more subtle notes of clove, cinnamon and berries.  As it develops it mellows into soft, vanilla smoke and leaves a warm cigar-like finish.

This is a beautifully complex dram, softer than you would initially expect but still packing a kick.  Wonderful!"

3.75,"So I'll just apologize for what will be a terrible review. I'm just terrible with peat notes sometimes. 

nose - There isn't much to talk about here. It's super sweet, sugars, vanilla, oak, and peat. It's got a nice oak profile. There are some cool bourbon notes here. 

taste - rich, creamy, but insanely complex. The oak is complex and rich but yes a touch bitter. The malt is the classic octomore sweetness forward malt. 

Sorry guys, I don't have enough to say here. It's just really good octomore. It's that super sweet profile, candy cigarettes, peaty goodness, and just rich and velvety. 

I'll debate the final score but 3.75 for now. Really really good, but we'll see if I go 4.0 later."
