3.0,"The nose is soft peat, really smooth, caramel, sweet apple juice, green banana, damp leaves in autumn.

The palate arrives intense, it is briny and really quite salty, with a young burn to it. The peat is actually really nice but I didn’t expect it to be that intense. It is on the more heavy side of PPM for sure. 

I just had a Bunnahabhain Toitach A Dha just before this one and they are very very similar - both on the nose and taste. Who knows - maybe it is."
