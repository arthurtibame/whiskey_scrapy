3.5,"Nose:   Lots of brown sugar.  Dark baking spices: ginger, nutmeg, clove, cinnamon.  

Palate:  Similar to nose.  Sweet:  brown sugar and the hickory syrup.  Tobacco and leather to balance out the sweetness.  Pronounced wood flavor for a relatively young whiskey with a special finish, but the hickory eliminates the tart taste that comes with really woody whiskies.  Doesn't lead with the alcohol, so it's quite drinkable neat, if bracing on the finish.

Finish: Spices start to give away to a pronounced maltiness with a touch of salt. Probably takes a few days to finish.  Seriously, this whiskey combines the barrel proof and hickory finish to stick around for a looong time.

Overall:  This is a nice whisky that shows how the right barrel management can bring a lot of complexity to a young whiskey.  It would be dangerously good, if it could sit for 4-6 years in the barrel.  Yes, it's a bit pricey at $90, but you're paying for the rarity and innovation from a young distillery.  It's a special-treat kind of whiskey.

p.s:  I rarely put ice in whiskey, but this one seemed to suggest it and it worked very well.  The ice turned down the hotter spices and turned everything else up: brown sugar and baking spices.   It also got a little herbal.  It's another good way to experience this whisky, but don't let the ice completely melt or you'll ruin it."
