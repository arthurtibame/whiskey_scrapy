3.5,A lot of raisins on the nose. Sweet and fruity.
3.75,"Yet another Bunnahabhain Unpronounceable bottling:  An Cladach, which translates as “The Shore” in Gaelic.  This bottle is a travel retail exclusive that’s sold in 1 Liter size and is bottled at a robust 50% ABV.  It’s light/amber gold and oily with runny legs in the taster.

The nose is salty if you go in immediately after the pour.  I had to wait this one out to get the subdued sherry notes, along with toffee and raisins.  A lighter, chocolate and coffee grounds note formed the background noise here- with almost no perceptible barrel wood.  The high ABV is also very well hidden.

The palate hits hard with youthful spirit and a slight oaky harshness.  The ABV sets the tone, but also seems to evaporate away and leave behind the perfect balance of sherry, roasted nuts and salty sea air.  There’s a nice, briny note that you don’t often see with Bunna.  It took me by a bit of a surprise, even though the name is telling me to be on the lookout.  The light, milk chocolate also masks the tougher back end just enough to keep things in check.

The finish is medium, and slightly on the weaker side- with the typical suspects playing a closing role:  sherry sweetness, peppery oak and some red berries and cream.  The extra oomph from the ABV causes everything to dry up rather quickly, but damn it’s still enjoyable.

Overall, at $66 for a 1L bottle I have to say this is a really good deal.  It’s another winning NAS formula from Bunnahabhain and I gotta point out that most of these crazy-named releases are really hitting the mark.  Whatever they lack in smoothness and complexity they make up for in value and experimentation.  This one is no different.  I’m giving it 3.75 solid stars and a recommended “buy”.  Cheers."

4.0,"Nose - Very sweet & fruity, hint of syrupy golden raisins, hint of elderflower, sweet nuts, juicy red berries, hint of bitter dark chocolate.

Taste - Sweet nutty/syrupy sherry, white pepper heat/spice/tingle, light metallic taste, sweet nuts, honey, sweet white grape juice, hint of ginger, light salt.

Finish - Lingering white pepper spice, faint dry tannic bitterness, light metallic lingers, metallic white grape juice sweet, hazelnut/almond skin, metallic salt.

Score - 84/100

Final Thoughts - This is a bit tough. It has a pretty good nose in that you really get a nice fruity/nutty nose on it which does follow through to the palate, but then you're suddenly hit by this odd metallic taste. Like it somehow got stored in a reactive metal tank or something. Kind of hard to describe, but it's similar to that of a metallic taste in some salts. Regardless, it's quite tasty albeit I'm sure pretty young. I think if it was aged a bit longer to somehow mellow out or get rid of the metallic notes somehow, it'd be a lot better.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes

Would I buy a bottle? - If it stays around the same price yes."

2.5,"Nose is all sherry. Palate is also markedly sherries, with caramel, salt and fruit, but a brackish, metallic piquancy interferes right up front and again near the end. Young and unbalanced."

4.0,I find the nose interesting if dirty. Lots of spice. I like it.
3.75,The pepper is very present and the expert review is pretty accurate. Beautiful aroma however and I like it for the salty earthy but still smooth texture.
3.5,"Lots of sherry on the finish, very smooth."
3.5,Easy drinking
3.5,"Not a review! Also not a bad drop... at all!

Can’t quite understand the super low score this whisky got from the oficial review.

Maybe he just got a bad/sulphured batch, maybe our palate is just too ordinary... Who knows?!

Everything I know is this whisky may be a bit young (as the nose suggest), but it is good, with lots of Sherry goodness and an amazing value!

Glad that I got over the bad score and bought it anyway."

4.0,Spicy and fruit notes. Slightly peaty.
3.0,"A lot of hazelnut on the nose along with some fruits and chocolate. Very present alcohol but nothing bothering especially for its 50% ABV. Water opens it up quite a bid. 

Taste is nice as well starting right up with a peppery burn but also the nutty aromas and a bid of salt."
