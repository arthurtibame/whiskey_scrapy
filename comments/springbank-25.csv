4.0,"So I just spent 40 minutes trying to add Glengoyne 30 year to the site with zero luck....even using their horrible ap. So that review is pending if I can get it added. So why not review 2018 edition of springbank 25? Also...really each year should have a different review.

So I'll be honest, I've read that this has vatting with port after bourbon and sherry maturation and I'm reading one place saying this is exclusive ex sherry. The color doesn't scream sherry. So I'm honestly not sure. But it seems I'm seeing more notes that this is 100% ex sherry so I'll assume that's right.

Nose - There's a rich oak note to this one, you can tell this spent time in casks and it has imparted a lot of serious oak notes. It however isn't like a bourbon or even some other older scotches, the oak has almost been taken over by springbank funk and the two are playing in a unique sharp and salty way. There are red fruits but without being told sherry, I wouldn't sure of the finishing. This is an assertive, aggressive, and bitter nose.

Taste - As one would expect this is a challenging dram and despite a few months open I'm still not to the shoulder on the bottle. Umami, sweet, salty, and fruity notes are all here. A complex and vanilla infused sherry and oak finish. It does have a finish of those ""sugar"" cookies that Keith, Malted Man Cave always gets. Water actually does tame some of the oak and brings in more sweet vanillas but also brings a touch more sea salt (which isn't bad). 

These are some very tired and very very used sherry casks and frankly sometimes if you use such casks you better not chill filter and you sure as heck better age it a while. That said the salty and unami springbank malt is working to make this a really challenging dram with the sherry, light as the notes are, somewhat bringing it back towards balance without getting there.

This is 100% going to be a highly polarizing and likely disliked springbank 25 for a great many people. I'm rather enjoying this myself and will go with a 4.0, at 800 bucks that's not really acceptable, but the level of complexity all be it, lacking in depth, and the challenges of this one do lead me to appreciate that this was not a cheap to make whisky.

Those seeking candy and sweet drams need stay the hell away, look for a port finished version of their 25. This one is for whisky geeks who want something off the beaten path.

Given the price, all but the most extreme of springbank fans should avoid."

4.0,"I love the 15 year which at $85 USD here in NZ I think is the best VFM springbank. The 18 year at $120 is the runner up. The 21 year is bonkers though at more than $200USD. So when I saw a sample of the discontinued 25 year for $30 I thought yeah I'll have a crack. So was it worth it? A yes.... for the experience. It's a great drop, not much port coming through, definite orange peel, tobacco and pepper as the MoM reviewed, lovely on the mid palate but aftertaste is short. I personally prefer the more in your face rougher 15 year especially for the price. It's interesting that often with my favorite distilleries and the peated stuff e.g. Laphroaig, Talisker, Caol Ila, Ardbeg and now Springbank I find the oldest stuff good but not better than the middle aged brethren. It's almost like a bell curve for me when it comes to preference with 15 to 18 years or a blend of older and younger being the sweet spot especially once VFM is factored in. Still the longer I linger on this one I think it'd  be nice to work through a bottle but no way I'd pay the price! It is as the previous review mentioned missing the Springbank 'funk' I like."

4.0,"2016 edition

Sherry, Bourbon & Married in Refill Port Cask

Nose is absolutely bonkers.  Citrus fruits yet with a red wine finish, rich springbank malt, and a hint of oak.  Incredibly intense and powerful.  

The pallet is very vanilla forward with a huge amount of really mellow wood spice, hints of sherry and perhaps grape like notes from the port finish.  

The finish lasts forever with that nicely seasoned well done wood notes.  

This comes up short of exceptional.  I normally would comment on how at cask strength it would be amazing, but I'm not sure that's needed.  The mouth is creamy, viscous, and the alcohol doesn't seem overly tame.  I feel weird saying this but it just doesn't have enough impact from the casks it has been in.  I think the time in the port was too short and likely too much of it was in the bourbon casks.  Meanwhile the oak has mellowed out some of the springbank funk.  

Make no mistake, this is a truly outstanding whisky and I expect with time it will open up.  For now, it's hard to live up to the hype of the price."
