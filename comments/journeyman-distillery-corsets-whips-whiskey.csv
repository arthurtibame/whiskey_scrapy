4.5,Scandalous label and scrumptious whiskey.
2.5,Decent. Oily.
3.25,Got some forward heat. Neat on ice it sweetens up.
4.25,"Another great example of Journeyman’s incredible skill at making whiskey. Nice burn, vanilla, barrel spices."
1.25,Nose is spicer than expected. Sort of like burnt sugar. Taste is not good. Almost caustic. Lingers in an also. It good way. Like cleaner

3.75,"More of an aged barrel flavor, like a spicy Slaughterhouse which is a fav of mine.  Really hits the nose neat, much smoother on ice.  Good either way"

4.25,"Deep root spice, such as licorice and anise. Almost like a sarsaparilla soda. Lingering Vanilla notes thru the finish with a faint blackberry sweetness. 

Makes a great Sazerac!"

4.25,"Aroma: really hot out the gate but after it sits tons of vanilla and barrel come through.

Flavor: really smooth for the proof, coats the tongue. Vanilla, caramel, some spice, a little savory dessert notes and more barrel than you would think for a younger whiskey.

Overall: Easily my favorite from Journeyman! A cask strength wheat whiskey that's bold and smooth is hard to come by and this doesn't disappoint"
3.25,First sip spice hit me hard but it definitely mellowed out after the 3rd sip and I kind of missed the heat from the first taste. I did enjoy the sweetness of the finish. I would purchase this for my collection but it probably wouldn’t last long.
4.0,I really enjoyed this one!  I like the spice and boldness up front and was pleasantly surprised with how sweet it finished. I thought it drank really well especially for 120proof. I will definitely be buying another bottle. Cheers!

3.75,Has some bite - but the bite is nice - a little oily - fine on rocks but not needed.  This was a good taste - with a nice slow burn after.  Sort of dances on your tongue - maybe could get in trouble with a bottle of this.
3.75,Very good! What a bite up front. It cleared my sinuses then finishes really nice. It’s much sweeter than I expected it to be. Great cold night campfire whiskey!

5.0,"Don't have tasting notes, don't feel like describing in detail. I will tell you though, this is the best bourbon I've had. Was sold into it by my local guy, hesitant at first because I never heard of it... Glad I took his advice. So damn good. Period."
