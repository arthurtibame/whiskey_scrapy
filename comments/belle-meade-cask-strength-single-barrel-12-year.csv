5.0,"One of the best MGP bourbons I’ve tasted. Butterscotch, vanilla, toasted oak and caramel. Very well-integrated, given the 118 proof. 10/10!"
4.5,Spice/tingle/burn than smooth finish for cask strength.  Really good stuff. Should make an effort to get some.

4.75,"Neat.  Nose is quintessential MGP.  Nice berries and cream with vanilla frosting.  Hint of oak that transforms into a dark chocolate.  Little toffee and hit of spearmint.  Baking spice.  Really clean MGP nose on this barrel.

Thicker mouth feel than I was expecting with the moderate proof level.  Hmmm oh hell yeah.  Good MGP on this one.  Vanilla frosting with a hint of those baking spices as it sits on the tongue.  Transitions to more vanilla, eucalyptus, vanilla, and ends on a nice milk chocolate.  Dessert lingers on the legs.  

I have a lot of good MGP bottles but this may be close to the top.  Surprised how great this is considering it’s moderate value compared to other MGP.  I’d put this ahead of my Blaum for example."

4.25,"Very strong ethanol nose that doesn’t transfer through to the taste. Enjoyable cask strength pour with good flavor, but not particularly a stand out for the normal price point. Bub City restaurant pick sold during COVID liquidation"
