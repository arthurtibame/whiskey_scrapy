1.5,"Nose: Toasted marshmallows, vegetable funk, dried wood, old dusty leather, dried apple rings. 

Taste: dried apple rings again, slightly sweet, takes a turn towards the dry wood funk and slight sour. 

Adding water or ice brings the sweetness up and hides a bit of the vegetal notes. 

Was hoping to like it a lot more than I do, was even will to deal with the vegetal notes I know were coming if there was more behind it but this is really it, some sweet candy notes with a lot of funk. At least the bottle looks great."
