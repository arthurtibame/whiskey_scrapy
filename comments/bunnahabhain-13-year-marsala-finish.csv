4.5,"The mixture of exotic honey notes in this whiskey is impressive:  honeyed biscuits on the nose, buckwheat honey in the palate, drying honeycomb on the finish.  It's think, full flavored, and a delight for someone looking for an earthy, herbal dram.  The nose has compliments of buttery pine nuts, almonds, vanilla, and hay.  In the palate, there's rich body which is full and chewy laden with notes of biscuits, loads of dried apricots, walnuts, and more vanilla.  The finish has a nice, prickly spice character to it, a bit of dry wine, and stewed vegetables.  Still, hovering over it all, is that honey--made all the more impressive given the viscous and full flavor of this whiskey."

4.25,"Sweet, spicy, cloves, cinnamon, leather, tobacco, long and lingering finish."
4.0,"Apricot isn’t a flavor I recall encountering previously in a whisky, but I found it here, subtly, on the nose and in the mouth. Turns out it’s one of the primary flavors of Marsala, I later discovered while researching this fortified wine made from white grapes. (Score one for my flavor vocabulary, which I rarely feel confident in.) That fruity note is one of many lovely components to this well balanced whisky. I also noted a sweet grape must on the nose and a sweet light peat that takes on a thicker texture in the mouth — not medicinal or barbecue but something like smoked bread or cake if there is such a thing. There’s also a soft creamy note throughout, including on the long finish where the sweetness and peat blend harmoniously. Despite the wine casks and the smoke, it never feels heavy or overpowering, though I bet the higher ABV version it’s also released is also delicious. A good deal at it’s original price of $80."
4.0,"As with all the distillery’s “Moine” expressions, the smokiness is pronounced and right at the front of the palate, with a medium-to-long finish.  Lots of wood tastes (in a delicious way) with a much more accessible option than the Bordeaux-cask option."

4.0,"Another of the wonderful samples from the hotel room tasting in DC, courtesy of @Telex. This Bunnahabhain is aged 10 years in ex bourbon casks and then finished for 3 years in Marsala red wine casks. Bottled at 46.3% ABV and is non chill filtered and natural color of a nice amber. 

Strong red wine notes on the nose, but this is what I call a slow breather. Take this one in slowly, allow it to fill the senses gradually. Big sniffs will kill all of the wonders trapped within. Almond butter, marzipan, cherries and concord grapes. Vanilla, bourbony oak and light mint. Mixed berry pie filling, glazed jelly donuts, and light brown sugar. It has a similar feel to a good port finished whisky. Buttercream frosting and it becomes syrupy at the bottom of the glass. Water nearly kills the nose but brings out more of a buttery note and some grasses. 

Red wine, cherries and red grape skins are the main notes on the palate. Buttery with a hint of pepper. Slightly grassy with light toffee and brown sugar. Water brings vegetal and herbal notes, but does nothing to improve the taste. 

Medium bodied mouthfeel that is lightly oily, mouth coating and dry. 
The finish is long with red wine, almonds and grapes. Dry. 

This one is all about the nose. I could nose this all day. The palate is less exciting but still solid. An all day, every day kind of dram...if you have a sweet tooth. I’m not sure the price point on this one, but I would say if it’s under $125 it’s a no brainer. Definitely do not add water, this one is best as is. 4.25-4.5 easily. 
Cheers"
4.0,"Here’s a flashback to a whisky that I was introduced to back in April, while pre-gaming for Whiskyfest DC:  Bunnahabhain 13 Marsala Finish.  This bottle takes 10 year old, standard Bunna juice and finishes it in Italian, Marsala wine cask for an additional 3 years.  Thanks to the generosity of my friend @Telex, I was given an additional pour of this after the festival to enjoy and review at a later date.  This is that review.

The color is deep caramel and toffee, with thick, oily legs and a nice steady oil slick all the way around the tasting glass.  It’s bottled at 46.3% and I believe it’s natural in color and isn’t chill filtered.  I don’t seem to recall what he paid for the bottle, but I’m pretty sure it’s rare.

The nose has a wonderful grapy-ness with some crisp, tart apples.  There’s a little pie crust and fresh cut oak, but no real depth of these flavors.  They all come and go as I let it set in the Glencairn.  However, the palate reveals complexity and some depth, which was a pleasant surprise after the nosing, a deep rich vanilla and sweet wine.  It’s sticky-sweet and just envelops the tongue and stays there until you wash them away.  There’s some barrel astringency, but it helps release some warmth and reminds you that you’re drinking whisky and not eating a dessert pie.  The finish is medium length, warming and very nice.

Overall, this one was much like the Springbank that Jason sent home with me.  I didn’t enjoy it as much while at the hotel, but I really got a kick out of it on its own and without all the competition it faced in the hotel room.  I’d say it’s a solid, 4 star dram and I wouldn’t mind having an additional pour for those days when I’m looking for a nice, dessert whisky.  Cheers."

4.0,"A little funk on the nose, right off, but don’t let that fool you.  That’s just that nice Marsala cask saying “hello!”  Almonds up front, with vanilla, a slight green apple/tea, and tobacco note on the nose. The palate brings marzipan, cream, vanilla, truffles, a little smoke, and white pepper.  Mmmmm good!  The oily medium mouth coat brings a well rounded long finish of smoked fish, capers, and faint ash. This is a very nice change to Bunny’s typical line. It will make you want to try more expanded offerings they have.  4.0. The theme for this dram should be “Si Maritau Rosa” by Gian Campione since @LeeEvolved scoffed at my last Italian favorite. I am just sticking with the region of the cask, maaaaaaaan.  :)"
