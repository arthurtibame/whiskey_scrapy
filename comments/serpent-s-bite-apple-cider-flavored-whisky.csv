5.0,Pleasant cider taste but not too sweet. Less of a bite than most whiskeys.

1.5,Artificially sweet and overpowering.
5.0,Similar to fireball in the sense that its a heavily flavored whiskey. It is far superior in flavor to the Jack Daniels apple and it makes an absolutely amazing party shot with apple juice chaser or as an additive to make a hard apple cider.

5.0,I bought my second bottle of this whisky and I seem to like it very much. I just happen to run into it at Kroger and thought I would try it and it's very good.

1.0,"Smooth is the only beneficial quality. It tastes like old cough syryp. I made it through half a glass. I am struggling to throw away whiskey, no matter how terrible. Maybe I will use the rest of the bottle to clean my kitchen sink or disinfect my dogs paws. At least that way it won't be a total waste."
3.0,"Very easy to drink, sweet almost juice like"
