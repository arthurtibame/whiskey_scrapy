3.5,"At one of the Liqour stores I frequent, I arrived late on a Friday afternoon to loud arguing between the wife and husband over a sign the town would not approve (they are an older sweet couple and their sons run the shop). After profanity in both English and what sounded like Farsi, the settle down and ask if I need help. After looking around I don't see anything I am overly excited about and decide to buy their EC store pick which is really tasty. As I am about to check out I ask if anything new came in that is good. Her response "" The boys who like cigars like this one. It's very good! They buy it a lot"". Having already bought a lot of EC in my life I figured why not. Now let's get the backstory on the bottle:

1) It's distilled in Tennessee (Distillery undisclosed)
2) It's age stated at 3 yrs so it's a young Rye
3) Mashbill is 51% rye, 45% corn and 4% malted barley
4) It's finished in French Grenache Casks 
5) It's clearly charcoal mellowed and bottled at 45% abv

On to the tasting:

On the palette it's a lush entry with cinnamon, clove, brown sugar sprinkled on fresh red berries. Vanilla and oak are found on the mid palette that leads to a lengthy red fruit and barrel spice finish. The after taste is classic red wine tannins with a slight astringency. It's all in balance and honestly for the price it's a must have.
Is it incredible? Heck no, however at this price point it's hard to find something with this much depth and uniqueness. Furthermore it's actually well constructed and doesn't taste young. The finishing is nuanced and my guess is it spends very little time in those casks. Skip the Burning Chair (the more expensive, crap Bourbon) and buy this. Cheers all!"

4.25,Cloves. Berries. Strong. Very good young whiskey that to me doesn't necessarily taste young.

4.0,"This is very obviously sourced Dickel rye. Vanilla, oak, red fruit and berries, rye spice. Wine notes on the finish. Somewhat astringent. Nicely balanced. Interesting young rye at a great price point."
3.0,"Interesting. Sweet, not too many young notes, the musty wine barrel notes are there. Not too floral. Surprisingly balanced. Again, interesting. 11/22/19"
3.75,"I have to say that I’ve wanted to try this for months but the packaging is a turn off to me so I resisted it.  I think Dave Finney (of Orin Swift Winery fame) would do well to put this pretty copper colored Rye in a slightly more conventional clear bottle with a less provocative label.  

What’s inside is pretty amazing for less than $30, though.  Others have suggested that it’s Dickel sourced, which is likely although I think the actual juice originated at MGP in Indiana. They offer the same mashbill as used in Redemption Rye. 

Whatever the machinations, the finishing in French Syrah barrels does add a slightly fruity complexity to the mid-palette and finish, with a “high corn rye mash” that spilts the difference between Rye and Bourbon in sweetness.  

On second thought, it seems to be sitting on the shelves at my local Total Wine so now that I’ve discovered it—perhaps they should leave the stylized but homely packaging alone so I can buy all they have."
4.0,"Lip Service Rye
Nose: The first time you pop the glass cork you are met with the strong smell of fermented grapes. Pours into the Glencairn the color of a new penny. ""Dry"" applies to most of the nosing notes. You get the Red Wine and Dried Fruit, Leather, Citrus, and Black Pepper. Some Dried Corn? A hint of Dill? Dry Spices and hints of Dry Wood. Think an old weathered untreated plank of Barn Wood. The nose is very promising.
Neat: A general overall Sweetness, but also Peppery and Tingly. Again, a general ""Dryness"". There is so much going on that it is hard to pin down. Red Wine from the secondary barreling is prominent. Toasted Marshmallow, Dark Berries, Drying Oak, all precede a smooth tingling finish that leaves a coating of Drying Oak and a sweetness reminiscent of Honey & Beeswax. 
Splash: A little water really accentuates the ""wine-y"" character of the nose. The overall character becomes Less Dry. The fruit notes transition from dried to fresh. It picks up a gingerbread note on nose and palate. Very Unique. I could nose this one all day. On the finish, the coating starts to remind me of the hard pink Bubblegum that was always stuck in your pack of Topps Baseball Cards. 
Verdict: I went in knowing it was gimmicky, but still expected to like it. I was wrong...I LOVED it! This may be the best example of barrel finishing an American Whisky that I've had...And at a great price of $32."
3.75,"So @dubz480 gave this one a thumbs up and there was quite a conversation that ensued afterwards about the potential sourcing of this rye. Let me say after procuring a bottle of this I’m also a believer that there’s more than likely a little Dickel tickle in this one. 

Slight wood, anise & baking spices on the nose, that is where the rye similarity ends for me. The body was a complete surprise and I think that’s where Dickel comes in. I’m no Tennessee whiskey expert but you can detect the limestone mineral similarity that exists here. The body is truly balanced for a young 3 yr old, traditional wood barrel notes with raspberries and baking spices, the finish is fruity and fun and lingers nicely... it’s the berries. Much sweeter than I expected in a rye but it is extremely approachable, completely different, non typical, barely qualified rye that is fun and different and definitely worth a try. This isn’t just lip service, it delivers a very unique rye experience and at this price I’ll keep it around. 

...for the record I found the bottle packaging too hokey, then again I’m an Old Dude."
4.0,Very smooth rye.
4.0,The D66 barrels it finishes in really come through. Incredible value.
