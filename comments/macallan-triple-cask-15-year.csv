4.25,"""Light amber color that leaves moderate legs in the glass. Honey, melon, nuts and light smoky nose. Sweet and balanced - fantastic! The bourbon finish is noticeable. This drinks real easy with a medium finish"

3.75,"Sweet on the nose with hints of grapes and other fruitiness. A slight note of butter? A light wisp of smokiness and a clean, if spicy finish."

4.5,"Never had any Macallan before. I was gifted this bottle and very appreciative to receive. Poured neat, nose is deep sweet fruits and buttery malt. Tangerine, dates and hint of white grape surrounded by autumn leaves and gentle oak. Very refined. Palate has rich thick malt and fruits transitioning to wood notes then robust French roast coffee & cream. Has some heat to it but still maintains smooth. Finishes long with malt, fruit and dark chocolate fading dry to coffee and wood. This is not cheap scotch, goes for $90-120. Truly excellent sophisticated single malt but is it worth it? Macallan has a reputation of being a bit overpriced. Depends on your financial situation. I wish I could drink nothing but these high end aged scotches as they are sublime to my palate but alas the credit card bill eventually shows up. For my money in this age range I would take Glenfiddich 15 or Balvenie 14 over this for less $$ however I cant drop it below A rating despite the price as the quality and excellence is undeniable..........94/100"
