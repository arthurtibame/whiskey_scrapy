4.0,"Bottled at 40%abv, with an amontillado sherry color.

On the nose, a sherry profile: sherry, cola, salt, peat, apples, blackberry marmalade.

On the palate, caramel, almonds, wood, oranges, ashes and a hot long finish with a little spicyness.

Overall it is an 83 over a 100."
3.5,Very consistent color. Mellow nose with just a hint of alcohol at the finish. Smooth going down with a tiny burst of alcohol fumes through nose on the follow through. Savory and effervescent taste. Slight afterburner effect as an afterthought.
3.5,Very smooth with a spicy finish and notes of nutmeg
3.0,"Nose: sweet, honey, bit of woodness in the background, alcoholic.. Palate: sweet, a bit pungent, then creamy. Finish; short, sweet, then longer bitter/spice/pepper."
