4.0,"Australian Single Malt Whisky Tasting (Part 1), The Oak Barrel, Sydney 16 January 2020, Whisky #4

Nose: Fresh and full sweet aromas of cereal, vanilla shortbread, plums, baking spices and lightly fragrant fortified wine. There is no indication of high abv at all and no off notes. A rich but crisp nose.

Palate: Sweet honeyed arrival with the botrytis cask finish being obvious. Toasted marshmallow, oatmeal cookies, creme caramel, and a touch of butterscotch supported by supple aged oak. Weighty, but delicate - firm, but elegant. The texture is creamy and excellent.

Finish: Medium/long. Delicately sweet throughout.

Hobart Whisky is produced by Devil's Distillery in Moonah, and inner-northern suburb of Hobart. Established in 2015 they hit the ground running and have already accumulated an impressive array of domestic and international awards, and have been well reviewed by some high-profile critics.

More importantly, the local whisky community has enthusiastically embraced their releases. Maturation is typically in ex-bourbon casks, often with a short finishing in ex-fortified wine, pinot, tokaji, stout, rum and even maple syrup casks. This particular expression was a special limited release for The Oak Barrel's Sydney Whisky Fair in 2019 and was matured in ex-bourbon then finished in a re-coopered Tasmanian sauvignon blanc botrytis wine cask.

The personality of this sweet dessert wine shows through in every aspect of the whisky but with a light-handed touch. It never becomes cloying or overbearing but rather it supports the rich malty character of the unadorned spirit and its sweetness completely masks the high proof (109.6).

The addition of water brings out a little bitter spice on the palate and a floral but slightly soapy fragrance on the nose. I'd recommend taking this very easy to drink spirit neat.

Like almost all Australian whisky this is expensive - $220 for a 500ml bottle - but it's one of the first I've tasted that I would actually consider buying at that price. It's also the first Australian whisky that I'm rating here at 4 stars.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars."
