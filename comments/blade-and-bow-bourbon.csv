4.5,"Sweet, vanilla, some heat, but finishes quickly. Doesn’t try to hurt me. I love this."
3.5,Smells deep and Woody. Sweet undertones. Medium body but bright oak flavor that's super strong. A little bright and sharp but great flavors.
3.75,Genuinely surprised - sweet notes on the nose and a nice mellow vanilla/caramel palate. Short finish but for around $50 it’s a solid choice to keep you off the expensive stuff
3.5,"First reaction. Meh
Second reaction. Not a whole lot of anything. 

Finally. Well, its a cool bottle... I guess"

4.0,This bourbon warms the soul.  Sweet and spicy with a full mouth feel.  Not the most complex bourbons but definitely a crowd pleaser.  Shop around for this one.  I've seen it sold for as high as $60 but also seen it in the low 40s.  $40 -$50 seems reasonable.
5.0,"Excellent! We have a very well-stocked Bourbon bar, and this one is a new favorite."
3.5,A very straight forward and approachable whiskey. I'd compare it to Buffalo Trace to be honest in that both are pretty simple and not overly spicy. Some sweat oak flavors. Good but not worth the price. I'd rather have BT at half the price.
4.5,"The peaches from the nose carry over and are joined with white pepper, vanilla, oak, and a little grain spice. It’s light and enjoyable with a nice balance of sweet and a dash of spice. The palate makes this really easy to sip on."

3.25,"Don't stop your up-armored dodge caravan in the middle of the zombie filled street for this bourbon. Seriously, you'll be risking too much for a lackluster payoff.

It's very neutral, not complex ..nose and taste. The heat bloom that happens around your tongue is really the only fun part of this bourbon.

Shoot a couple zombies out of frustration, and just keep driving toward the next whiskey deposit."
3.25,"Quick to moderate legs / viscosity , maybe younger 6-9 years?
Moderate Brown color
Nose - Toasted cheerio/ nutty / chocolate / caramel
Palate - more initial spice, oily maybe. Very long finish. /"
3.75,Nose is sweeter than I recall. Taste is smooth with a little burn that grows as it travels. Hangs around a bit after swallowing. Overall decent pour. Maybe not worth the $40-$50
4.5,"N: Big vanilla and caramel
P: Creamy caramel 
F: Peppery and char"

4.25,"Nose: Toasted oak, vanilla, ethanol.  Toasted cereal grains and salt - there's this almost Play-Doh vibe going on and I'm not mad about it.  Giving me vibes of a bowl of Cheerios with sugar and banana slices.  Sliced red bell peppers, dried herbs.  Floral, mint, general citrus-y note.  Subtle and nuanced.  Very friendly.

Palate: Oak - toasted and charred.  Just a touch of barrel bitter.  Peaches, bananas, oranges.  Cream.  Molasses.  Mint.  Nutmeg, dill.  Medium-light mouthfeel, the proof is just about where it should be, adding a nice effervescent character that helps add just a hint of drama.  Just like the nose, this stuff is incredibly friendly and approachable, but you could go exploring for a long time, to boot.  Finish starts off with toasted grains, bananas, peaches, and very ripe strawberries topped with whipped cream.  Things progress into a vanilla-flavored milk direction, with some cocoa and leather.  The floral notes then come back in - roses, honeysuckle, and orange blossoms.  Finish is medium in length and suits this quite well.

Other notes: Very early in my whiskey journey, I wondered if anybody was doing solera-style aging with a bourbon and, if so, what that would be like.  This answers that question and lives up to my expectations.  The subtle, nuanced complexity you get from the oak alone is really appealing.  This checks a lot of boxes and is very well balanced and very easy to sip, though I really want to know what a cask strength version of this would be like.  I really enjoy this and would likely buy again."

4.0,Heavy alcohol taste at first with smoother vanilla aftertaste. Nose is pretty bland. Enjoyable though.
3.75,"When I first got this bottle, it was OK but not great. After a month of sitting, though, it really opened up. Floral, vanilla, carmels, spice notes and some oak and char as well. The solera style makes this bourbon taste unique and is a gentle, friendly bourbon to have as a daily sipper."

3.0,"BACKGROUND: Spirits giant Diageo markets its Blade and Bow bourbon brand by blending current sourced bourbon with some of the last stocks remaining from the legendary Stitzel-Weller distillery, which was operated by Julian “Pappy” Van Winkle, Sr. and produced W.L. Weller, Old Fitzgerald, Pappy Van Winkle, and other well-known brands before ceasing production in 1992.  

Using a solera blending process of barrels that are arranged in a pyramid and constantly rearranged and replaced as they empty, Diageo claims that every bottle of Blade and Bow contains at least some portion of vintage Stitzel-Weller bourbon, although the amount is likely minuscule.

The bourbon’s name references the parts of a skeleton key - the blade shaft and the ornate bow at the top - and its label pays tribute to the five keys that once decorated the door of the Stitzel-Weller distillery and represented the five components of bourbon distilling - grains, yeast, fermentation, distillation, and aging.

Much like Blanton’s, which rewards customers who collect all eight of their different horse and jockey toppers, Blade and Bow sends a loyalty gift to consumers who collect all five of the keys that hang on their bottles.  Collectors of the full set are also offered a VIP tour of the Stitzel-Weller distillery, where Blade and Bow is blended and bottled today.

In addition to the no-age-stated bourbon, Blade and Bow also offers a version that is aged 22 years.

NOSE: The nose, which is somewhat ethanol-heavy, smells like the dust in a corn crib or grain bin.  Oak is prominent, as well, along with the scent of bread dough.  It is unusually difficult to pick out the individual parts of the nose.

PALATE: A medley of fruits opens the initial palate, and oak soon makes an appearance, as well.  There are waves of subsequent flavors that, much like the nose, are difficult to pick out and identify.  The mouth feel is a bit on the thin side.

FINISH: Barrel char dominates the finish, and chocolate and leather are present, as well.  A wave of heat and spice rises quickly but dissipates even quicker.

FINAL ASSESSMENT:  By marketing its supposed ties to Stitzel-Weller and by mimicking Blanton’s reward program for loyal consumers, Blade and Bow seeks to be considered an elite bourbon, but the product does not live up to the hype.  

It is a perfectly fine whiskey with an acceptable nose, pleasant palate, and subtle finish, but there is absolutely nothing special or outstanding about Blade and Bow that sets it above countless other bourbons.  Its retail price of $47.99 seems a bit overvalued for the experience you get, although the bottle is quite nice."

3.0,"This is a really nice smelling bourbon; fruity with notes of apricot & caramel.  Palate smooth and woody, improving with every sip.  Spicy on the back of the tongue,  drinking bigger than its proof, but not too hot- easy to handle.  Short to medium finish with very little burn.  This bourbon tastes a bit young, but it’s a  pleasant, easy to drink whiskey that would be a great starter for those just getting into the bourbon world."

3.25,"The nose has vanilla, roasted peanuts, light caramel, oak, and a grassy note. There is a slight ethanol note on the back end, but not too distracting. 

The palate is sweet and creamy with vanilla, a little peanut, a hint of oak and barrel char, black pepper and a slight ethanol note.

The finish has lingering vanilla sweetness and a slight bitterness on the back of the palate.  There’s a little burn at the top of the chest with a medium-ish length finish.

This one is fine. Fairly sweet and creamy, but nothing really special. Fairly one dimensional. I wonder how many drops of the old stitzel-Weller stocks is actually still in this haha."
