5.0,"Nose - Spice stewed dark dried pit fruits, dark chocolate covered orange peels, spicy vanilla, hint of marzipan.
Taste - Black pepper spice, stewed dark dried stone fruits, bitter dark chocolate, dark caramel, sherry soaked fruitcake, hint of orange zest.
Finish - Lingering black pepper spice, fades to red wine stewed dark stone fruit sweet, slight metallic finish like that from canned mandarin oranges, lightly drying.
Score - 91/100
Final Thoughts - This one has an absolutely amazing nose that I can smell for days. The more I nose it, the more I get out of it. It's like a sweet brioche french toast covered in a maple syrup that's been infused with sherry and dried stone fruits. It's not as intense on the palate as I think the potential chill-filtering and lower proof might have taken a bit out of this, but it's still quite tasty. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but most of the flavors you get on the nose are still there, although toned down a bit. Everything about this is great except for the slight metallic hint I get on the finish, which is a bit off putting. Overall, a great dram and I kind of wish they offered this at a slightly higher proof or at least un-chillfiltered to maintain all the great things I got on the nose."
