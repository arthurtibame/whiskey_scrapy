4.5,"Love this, very smooth, not too peaty but a nice sweet-peat. Bought this from a shop in Amsterdam - $45 for a .7L bottle."
4.5,"This is an outstanding peated Irish Whiskey. Has the sweet peat flavors that I like in Lagavulin Distillers Edition or Caol Ila Distiller’s Edition, but smoother. Had this at The Whiskey Bar in San Diego for $26 for a generous pour and will definitely buy a bottle once I find out where to source it."

This sourced spirit is made up of a single grain whiskey, a 10yo single malt and a 15yo Oloroso sherry finished single malt; all of which have been married together in a peated cask. 

Jim Murray gave it 94.5 points in his 2018 Edition and said of it:
""Even people purporting not to like peated whiskey will have a problem finding fault with this. This is a rare treat of an Irish.” 

This was my 28th (and final) tasting before being ushered to the exit at last year's WhiskeyLive. My notes from the night are equally as glowing:
""Actually nice. Hard to know if drunk contributes"""
