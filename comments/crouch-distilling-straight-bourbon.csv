3.25,"Crouch Distilling Straight Bourbon
2019 Batch 1 Bottle 177 46% abv
No age statement so assuming its at least 4 years. Blue corn, Malted Barley, Malted Rye Mash bill
Nose: roasted nuts, corn ethanol, chocolate malt, pan roasted corn, warm tortillas, vanilla and toffee cream, rye grain mash, mint cream, slight anise, sweet oak and leather. All 3 grains take turns making their presence known; not fighting with each other but each in turn. 

Palate: sweet corn, roasted chestnuts, chalky dark chocolate, oak vanilla, mint cream, Andes mints. Then the oak barrel really erupts on the mid-palate and just dominates after that. Charred oak, peppery barrel spice and a warm bear hug of proof. 
Finish: drying, chalky, chocolate mint, sweet and sour oak notes interplay, leather, cream soda. The finish is long and quite drying. 
If you love big barrel and wood notes as the dance a wild shag with the grain then this is a bourbon for you. The oak presence reminds me immediately of Woodford Double Oaked and OF 1910. But the mashbill and grain presence is quite unique. The corn is nutty and sweet, the barley is rich and malty, and the rye is minty but with a malted sweet roundness. Overall, it’s very enjoyable and unique as a bourbon. All local grains and aged 4 plus years in Satan’s armpit, aka Columbia, South Carolina. The heat influence and barrel presence are strong. Almost Texas-esque. The flavors are a touch spikey but not in a harsh way. A nice Carolina bourbon and worth a try."
