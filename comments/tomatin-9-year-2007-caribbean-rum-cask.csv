4.0,Very nice and smooth finish that is clearly rum cask. If you like rum finishes this one is for you!

4.0,"Only 6500 bottles were ever produced??? Sad...

Really great whisky - it's fruity and aromatic, with pear and vanilla on the nose. Palate has notes of cereal and sugar, like Frosted Flakes (AKA my favorite breakfast cereal). The finish has hints of cacao nibs. The texture is oily with a finish that is fairly long. 

If you can get past its well-hydrated urine-like color and the fact that getting your hands on this thing requires the services of Dog The Bounty Hunter... we're taking about excellent stuff here."
