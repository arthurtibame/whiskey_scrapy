1.75,"Smells way better than it tastes. On the nose, I get honey and chrysanthemum tea. I'm strongly reminded of an instant chrysanthemum tea my mom bought me from the Asian grocer when I was growing up. Also notes of rum on the nose.

Flavor wise, this is a sugary, rum like whiskey, with hints of sweet tea. I get the flavor component of tellicherry peppercorn, but none of the spice. I would have expected the opposite. Honestly, this tastes like a cross between cheap sweet tea vodka and rum. 

I don't know what to do with this. If you want whiskey, this is a 1.5/5. If you just want some kind of interesting flavored spirit, maybe it's a 2.5/5."
