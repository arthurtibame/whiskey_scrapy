5.0,Outstanding value and a must buy if you can find it. Last trip to KY I learned it's no longer being produced.
5.0,One of my all time favorites when I can find it.

3.0,"Nose: buttered corn, citrus orange, faint trace of mint Sip: thin, on the dry side, flash of caramel and vanilla moves quickly to leather, orange peel, anise, Finish: lingers for awhile anise moves into cinnamon and black pepper a nice high rye spice.  I usually prefer a sweeter Bourbon but this one is well spiced not over powering and not to bitter, a good change up to a sweet Bourbon."

2.0,"At Condados. 
I’m on day 23 of 30 days of bourbon. I’ve had nearly all the higher end bourbon offerings currently in stock. So I went with what others have said is a bottom shelf gem. 
Not a bad pour for $4, but not complex especially for a 10 year. Thin on the nose and palate with almost a watered down taste. Hits the tongue almost like water. Even though drinking neat. No heat or burn. And a finish that lingers for a little more than a moment. Odd taste at the front... saline? Not as sweet as expected. 
I can’t imagine seeking this out or having it in stock for my home bar."

3.25,"Solid bottom shelf work horse. Buffalo Trace mash bill #2 shines through with the higher rye content. Don’t confuse this with the standard Ancient Age, the 10 year is worth the minimal investment for your home bar."
