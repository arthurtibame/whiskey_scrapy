3.75,"Surprised how much I enjoyed this, really good to have around the house"
3.75,"Nose: Vanilla. Toasted almonds. Some apple and pear. A touch of honey and cane sugar.

Palate: Honey is stronger. Some grain notes. Slight citrus fruitiness blending with apple.

Finish: Medium-long. Sweetness lingers. Vanilla and marzipan. Some tartness of lemon.

Overall Thoughts: It’s a gentle blend that has a little kick to it that keeps it interesting. I enjoyed it and I think any Scotch drinker whether new or experienced would as well."

3.0,"I found this at my local liquor store for 99 cents per 50 ml and wondered, how bad could a $1 scotch be? 

Well, the nose isn’t bad and has some nice green apple and beeswax aromas. I continue to be impressed by the palate, which isn’t at all offensive like I anticipated. This scotch taste young and a little watery, but the flavor is enjoyable and has some nice honey, sweet corn, and malt. The finish isn’t complex, as the main flavors just fade away. 

I’m pretty impressed considering the plastic bottle and 99 cent price. This isn’t great scotch but it’s not bad. And I’d choose it over vodka any day."

4.25,"Inver House Green Plaid has an x.v. olive oil (greenish-gold) appearance and non-lingering alcohol legs. The aroma is of fairly bold grain whisky, with a shadow of peat & malt. The flavor is similar, with a bit of bees' wax and honeycomb. Mouthfeel is straight medium, and Green Plaid finishes moderate. RJT"
