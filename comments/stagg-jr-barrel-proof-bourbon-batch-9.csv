4.25,"Great cherry, oak and tobacco smell.   Can taste the cherry flavor.  At 131.9 proof it is too much burn for me neat.   With one ice cube it mellows.   A bit of spice and a smooth to drink but a bit bitter aftertaste on the back of the tongue."

(Tasted at Bourbon Bastards, 1/23/20)"

Dark cherries, brown sugar with a little citrus and a nice touch of oak."
