4.0,Most expensive bottle in the entire lineup and it did not disappoint. Rich bodied with hints of smoke. Big sherry cask influences give way to bourbon barrels on the finish.

3.5,"Not like the other Mortlachs I've had which have often been very meaty, sulphuric beasts. This is much lighter, almost soapy note. If anyone gave it to me I wouldn't have picked it as Mortlach for the life of me. Very nice light and uncomplicated...right now onto the grand finale!"

3.0,"Like drinking an old bookshelf.... in a kinda good way. The oakiness is borderline overpowering in this one, but it is definitely rich and flavorful. You just really have to like that element."

4.5,"At first sip this seemed fairly mellow but it's got some real bite and sharp edges.  The nose is rich sherry, some salt, and some hints of the characteristic Mortlach sulfur.

The taste is an interesting beast, it's deep sherry but there are some really interesting, but also characteristically Mortlach elements.  This whiskey is briney and there are caramel/toffee notes.  I also get cocoa.  I also get some dates, which I associate with the classic Mortlach spirit.  The Mortlach sulfur is in there as well.  The brine is quite salty, but there is a smokiness such that reminds me a bit of smoking a cigar. There are also peppery elements as well.  I also get an herbal, planty, fresh green wood flavor that I was not expecting.

These flavors are not subtle, but they also come and go - it's like rocks under turbulent sea water, as the waves crash, certain flavors splash up for a time, reside but come back.

This is really an interesting, robust, but complicated whiskey.  It has a rich, long finish as well.  It stands on it's own beyond the marketing gimmick.  But it also has a mysterious character that seems fitting to the Three Eyed Raven.  It's not a beginner whiskey, but it's a whiskey that could be accessible enough for a beginner to enjoy, particularly someone who had experienced a few of the other GoT branded whiskeys who determined that they actually liked scotch.  It's definitely one of the standouts in the collection."
