Another week of quarantine allows me to work through samples.  This particular pour comes by the way of @dubz480  Damp, dreary and cold calls for something with some backing and this one fits the bill.  60% abv should be able to warm the soul and provide a moment of respite from the covid bedlam. 

A rich current of corn meal, cloves and caramel initially greets you.  As it settles down, the caramel sweetness intensifies a bit.  Cinnamon,  maraschino cherries, vanilla, wood spice with a bit of pecan and almond nuttiness become the steady aromas. 

A lightweight arrival that is not instantly hot but the heat does crescendo.  The undiluted liquid, hot, is tough to discern any flavors.  What can be detected is sparse.  Vanilla cream, nutmeg, orange creamsicle. 

The finish is oaky and dry with a bit of angostura biters and grenadine. 

With two teaspoons of water the vanilla cream aroma pushes forward, but all in all, (The Song) remains the same. 

A hearty dram that packs a punch.  The dram being of age is not overpowered by wood, though being of 16 years. However, the flavors don’t pop and are rather bland.  There is some flavor but you have to work.  A steady pour that is decent, but I wanted more.  Thanks @dubz480 for sharing this rare (for me) bourbon. [84/100][Tasted: 4/17/20]"
3.5,"Very smooth. Not a lot of bite. Sweetness to it, a honey flavor"
3.5,Spicy all the way through.  Decent but not great.  Not bad though for a $9 pour.
