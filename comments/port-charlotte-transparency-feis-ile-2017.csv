4.0,"Honey's the theme of the second Feis Ile tasting tonight. It's there in the color (though lager also comes to mind). There are delicate notes of it on the nose and, once you've got through the burn of the neat alcohol, a long honey finish. With water, a subtle peat emerges, with caramel flavors and a long sherried coda."
5.0,"Smooth, sweet and smokey. 

Should have limited the sale to one per person as sold out within 1.5 hours."
