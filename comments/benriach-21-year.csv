3.0,"Benriach tasting evening, Sydney, June 24 2019. Whisky #2

Nose: A shy but elegant nose with subdued cereal and floral notes - rice crispies, unflavoured yoghurt, pyrethrum daisies, peach and some musky vanilla. Over time the nose became even softer and more musky. It's pleasant overall, but rather restrained.

Palate: Very soft and notably slow arrival mainly featuring mild spice, a little honey and dusty oak. The development brings gently intensifying fruity notes, spice and some curious funky oak. Dried semi-sweet apricots, milk chocolate and vanilla cookies. The texture is fairly neutral.

Finish: Medium. A sawdusty and flat oak aftertaste with a little caramel.

I found this to be a curious whisky. Not unpleasant, but too laid-back and undemonstrative.  The BenRiach house style is apparent, but everything seemed turned down to half volume. 

The nose was the best part, being gentle and reserved, but the palate was tedious, quirky, dull and flat.  Tasting it was like being on a train that took forever to get anywhere.  It certainly did not project any sense of maturity to me - just a sort of resigned age.

Intensity is not essential in a whisky profile, but for a relatively expensive dram this was uninteresting. I'd strongly recommend tasting it before purchasing a bottle, as you might be sorely disappointed. On the whole I thought it was ""better than average"", but only just, and at the asking price I certainly wouldn't buy it myself.

""Above Average"" : 3 stars"

3.25,"Yeah, that’s a BenRiach right of the bat. The typical Speysider with an extra portion of herbs and malty brittle. Very nice and deep nose - rich and sweet. 

Sweet and herbal on the palate as well with a fruity vibrance. Malty and oaky. The finish is medium long and leaves a spicey cola taste with some woody bitterness on the tongue. 

While this is a good whisky for sure, I think on its own it feels a bid to straight and one sided. But this would be a great base to finish in some exotic casks which BenRiach has some great expertise in."
4.0,"Lighter in color than the 20 yo. The nose is even more delicate. Traces of Bordeaux? Sweet and candied on the nose.

Tons of fruit. Apples and peaches and pears. Honeysuckle and vanilla. 

Tart and sharp on the pallet. Sherry and oak and spice. Gentle but complex. 

Not my favorite tonight at this tasting, but very very good. 

Great finish. Long and warming. Mmmm..."

4.0,Ah the older ages smooths out all that harshness.  And a bit sweet to boot.  But very complex on the body
4.0,"Soft, creamy, citrusy. Finishes sweet and spicy with a fruity end. The influence of the red wine casks is subtle: the whisky from those barrels spent only the last six years of its maturation there. I’d be quite happy to have a bottle of this, though it’s a step or two down from its peated sibling and ambitiously priced."
