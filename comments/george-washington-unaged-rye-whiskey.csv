3.0,"George Washington’s Original Rye Whiskey is limited whiskey made at Mount Vernon each year. The whiskey is unaged and surprisingly smooth. The distillery still uses the 18th century original recipe found in George Washington’s records. It is comprised of 60% rye, 35% corn, and 5% malted barley and bottled at 43% ABV.

Color: Clear

Nose: Grain, raw rye, raw corn, rye bread, and a country farm aroma.

Palate: More raw rye, corn sweetness, rye bread, oats, and is somewhat thick. 

Finish: Short with hints of rye and plain oatmeal."

3.0,"Visited Mt. Vernon July 2017. This rye is clear and unaged. 43%ABV. The nose is soft and I picked up a raw scent of grain, like smelling freshly milled corn grits. On the palate, a slight mineral, definite rye, but not as spicy as I expected. The finish is short and light."
4.0,"I'm not an expert on Rye whiskey, but visited the distillery at Mount Vernon and paid $88 for a  $375 ml.    This whiskey is CLEAR.  It is a white whiskey.  After the explanation of the ingredients, I asked about gypsum, and anyone who has seen recipes on the internet (or Moonshiners) includes gypsum in the recipe.  The Master Distiller at MV said there is no record of gypsum being used in the whiskies at MV.    They only distill in March and November, so when it's gone, it's gone.(went inApril, got 2016 bottle #61).   
I'm a fan of pot distilled whiskey (and abhor column distilling).    I found the novelty of this whiskeyworth the price.    I will enjoy sharing it with friends who will appreciate it."
