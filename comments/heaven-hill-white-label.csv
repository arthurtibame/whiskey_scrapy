3.0,"I had heard good things about the now discontinued white label 6yr bottled in bond (now replaces with a 7yr bib), so I thought I’d give it a taste. 

The Nose has soft banana and vanilla, a little bit of rye. I get some baking spices on nosings after the 1st sip.

Palate has banana, very light leather/rye, corn and light oak. It has a nice creamy mouthfeel.

The finish is on the longer side of short, but I was expecting it to be fairly short at 80 proof.


Overall, this one is fantastic for the price! I picked upa 750ml bottle for $8.99, unreal for what you get. Even though it’s only 80 proof, it still has decent pleasant flavor and not harsh at all."

1.75,"Heaven Hill Quality House Old Style Bourbon, also known as the Heaven Hill white label, is a Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey aged for 3 years, and at around $10 it is one of the most budgety of the budget bourbons. Why even bother reviewing a bourbon so inexpensive? Because I'm a man of the people, that's why, and every bourbon drinker, no matter what size wallet he or she has, deserves a quality review. As usual, I took my tipple poured neat into a Glencairn glass.

At only 80 proof, the white label had much more of an alcohol blast than I expected, even after letting it breathe for a few minutes. Making it past the ethanol wasn't easy, but underneath were notes of corn, vanilla, and raisin. The nose was nothing special, but it wasn't bad for a $10 bottle. The mouthfeel is thin and dry and the palate brings corn and brief brown sugar sweetness. There is almost no finish to speak of and an aftertaste of tobacco and oak. Is this the best bourbon made by Heaven Hill? No, of course it's not. But is it the best budget bourbon you can find? Also no. But for the price point, is this a bourbon worth having on the shelf to use as a mixer? Yeah, I guess. Grab yourself some store-brand cola and get shitfaced for less than $12, if that's your style."
