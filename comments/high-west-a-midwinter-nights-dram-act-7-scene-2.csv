5.0,"Superb rye whiskey. Fresh clean taste. A very easy 98.6 proof to drink neat after dinner. The port flavor is in the background of a nice drink. Vanilla, cinnamon, and caramel fill every drink. David Perkins and Brendan Coyle have a winner!"

4.5,"Tasted next to high west double rye 
Nose:dark, musty unfinished wood, a bit of a cognac like oak character (Boise-like?), what I'd imagine a rickhouse would smell like. Cocoa powder. Buried deep in the nose is a dark fruit richness like the flesh of a sweet plum. After a sip of double rye, the fruit becomes dominant than fades to a still fruity wood, than to spice. After asip of mwnd, goes back to the oak, cocoa nose.

Palate: a rich, creamy dark fruit that develops into baking spices, vanilla then cookie dough. Finishes with a lingering dry spicyness and oak"
