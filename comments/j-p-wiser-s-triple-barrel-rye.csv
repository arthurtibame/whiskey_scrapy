5.0,"The ABV is 43% and for $31.95 it can't get any better than this. All around great sipper, with a spicy and sweet flavour profile and little or no burn. Two thumbs up! :)

3.0,"This is a value whiskey, sweet and not shy about it's age. Very affordable, just picked up in SK Canada. $35."
5.0,"This whisky is absolutely incredible for the value. Lots of spice, a hint of apple cider, some vanilla, and the finish is incredibly smooth. Might be my favourite rye whisky on the market right now."

3.0,"Very smooth with sweet apple/apple cider, creamy wheat and soft rye spice. Super easy drinking with enough decent flavour to contemplate if you really want to, and cheap too! $30 in Ontario."

3.0,"Tasting Date:	03/29/2018
Nose: 13/20
Bright and sweet caramel-covered apples. Twist of zesty, but sweet and juicy navel orange. Nose is warm and sweet, but piquant. Red currant and dried cranberry. Mild fennel seed. Expecting a bourbon by the nose.
Initial Taste: 11/15
Bourbon on the initial punch, but the follow-up is immediate and unmistakably rye spice. The rye spice comes and lingers in the sinus cavity as if it were horseradish. Caramel crème candies, like Cowtails. Fairly mild in the initial impression, but every not perceived is a pleasant one. Very polite rye!
Body/Mouthfeel: 7/10
Medium bodied. Alcohol does not thin it out on the palate. Super smooth and caramel-sweet with a sugary slickness, like caramel crèmes.
Taste: 11/15
Chewing it, the same notes from the initial presence persist, bourbon corn notes, followed by some rye spice, and settling into light caramel and sugary crème filling, but there’s a slow fade into the navel orange note picked up in the nose. Nothing herbal, minty, or spicy in a salient, astringent, or pungent way. Notably, a bready character backbone is absent.
Finish: 12/20
For a whiskey that gives such a smooth and dainty performance, the finish sticks around! The rye spices, bready and punchy with caraway, coriander, and star anise stick little flavor pins and needles all over and continue to fill the nose. Nevertheless, the palate is left pretty dry and begs for another sip. No overbearing astringency, no cloying sweet, but not a ton of depth either and moderate alcohol burn.
Value: 10/10
For $16 I picked this up for…. Absolutely worth it, and I might go grab another bottle!
Overall: 6/10
Solid enough on its own, but for the serious rye drinker, it may be lacking in depth and/or intensity. Every note is good, but there’s not too much to explore here. A fine drink, but somewhat lackluster. Again, decent enough to sip, but certainly an excellent mixer for any rye cocktail, especially those using highly aromatic bitters.
Likely, this would be an excellent gateway rye for those who love very polite bourbons and want to dip their feet into some spice, especially with the low level of commitment to buy a bottle."

3.0,"I don't actually get the hype here, though I will agree that it's a good whisky. 

Think spicy pickles and dill juice with an alcoholic punch. It's good."
4.0,"Much better than I expected.  It's got character, spice, a great nose and it's got a pretty smooth finish. Can't beat the price. Great by itself or in an old-fashioned"
3.75,"I've bought this several times! $16 , 90 proof and tastes like a much more expensive bottle. Lots of caramel,  vanilla and rye on the nose. The palette is very nice with the vanilla and rye forward and a dark fruit taste ( similar to wine ) in the finish.  Most surprising budget bottle I've ever bought. Big fan!"

3.75,"Nose is light, but rye forward, a little citrus and grassiness. Mouthfeel is a bit oily, but just a bit. Flavor is a baking spices, citrus, vanilla, a little touch of spice. The spice lingers on the finish and fades to vanilla. Water adds vanilla to the nose and palate."

3.0,"Lots of spice from the get go, bits of vanilla and sweet notes right before the finish and then more spice."
3.5,"A woodsy spicy nose with a rich sweet rye taste. It is a young drink and has the expected finish for one, with the rye and corn lasting a little longer."
3.75,Nose is a bit heavy on the ethanol. Mouth feel is creamy and oily. Really nice rye and citrus flavor. Finish is soft citrus and vanilla.

4.0,"Rye, Pepper"
4.0,"A beautiful rye that could become a standard for mixed drinks at this price. This one sips grain, Rye and wheat, all the way through. Might be a tad long on the tongue. Might...but that feels nit-picky."
4.0,"I've been looking for a Canadian whiskey with flavor and this one satisfied the bill. Still has that sweet note of most Canadian whiskeys, but more toasty/woody notes. Higher proof (90) than most other Canadians on the shelves too.  The finish is also very smooth and it goes down easy for a higher proof liquor."

2.25,"Nice flavor, but with a 5 minute burn...  mixes ok, just don't drink it straight."
4.25,"Rye, rye, rye, some caramel, mint, eucalyptus, cooked fruit, and vanilla come out of the glass. 
There’s sweet simple syrup and a bitterness instantly on the tongue. Opening up, there’s plenty of rye bread, and spice, cinnamon and ginger, and a bit of cloves. 
The finish stays, with sugar syrup, rye, dill, and mint."
