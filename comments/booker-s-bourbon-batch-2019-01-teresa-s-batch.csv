4.5,On the nose I get a caramel and vanilla. The taste is a caramelized cherry and the proof shows on the finish which is long and charred barrel.
4.5,"Upon the initial smell I get a strong sense of oak with a hint of cherry. With the first sip your palette is immediately overwhelmed with a multitude of flavors. Smoke and oak rise as the most prominent flavors. Bookers 2019-01 is a phenomenal bourbon, and I’ve truly enjoyed every glass."
4.0,Very pleasant vanilla nose. The spice was consistent all the way down. Finish tasted chocolatey. Taste courtesy of Matt F.

3.75,"Definitely get a nutty and floral profile on this one. Relatively smooth going down, but I am becoming a bit of a proof hound lately so take that with a grain of salt 😏"

4.0,Good texture off the bat. Slightly nutty for me but a good balance between vanilla sweetness and ethanol. Very smooth and drinkable for the proof. Solid bourbon but a little pricey

4.25,"Deep, nutty flavor with oak and vanilla. Excellent heat and good coated mouth feel."
3.5,Straight peanut butter.
4.0,"Neat.  Peanut Butter.  The nose is like opening up a jar of peanut butter.  Syrupy mouth feel, spice on the palate.  More peanut butter.  Going to let this sit and see if I can get passed the peanut butter.  

Nope.  Peanut Butter.  Non-stop.

It’s delicious for what it does.  Unique among the Booker’s line.  Not in love with it but enjoying it."

3.5,Tried after GTS on 4th of July. It’s a solid pour but hard to stand up to GTS. About the same level as 2018-01
4.75,"Nose: peanut butter, caramel, brown sugar, black pepper, heat and spicy rye, oak, wood char
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Taste: Intensly flavorful and mouth coating. Vanilla, oak, caramelized apples, a little grape, peanut butter, and white pepper. It really starts quite sweet and transitions into a thick, savory peanut butter note. I think the texture plays into that. 
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The finish is a little tart and medium in pepper level, but much of the lingering flavors are driven by the heat.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Really an incredible whiskey. The alcohol heat lingers on your tongue for a long while, but is never harsh. This whiskey makes a very strong case for me to continue to explore cask strength whisk(e)ys, especially unfiltered.

4.5,"Here we go with not just my first barrel-proof bourbon, but my first barrel-proof whiskey period. Booker’s is a well-known one for bourbon fans and I’m glad I’m getting a chance to drink some. This one is 2019-01 “Teresa’s Batch” and clocks in at 125.9 proof(62.95% ABV) whew! Love the packaging, the great display box, and the bottle is really neat too with the simple label. Poured about 1.5oz into my Glencairn glass and rested a few minutes. Beautiful deep, rich gold color to this with some skinny little legs that take ages to form. Tasted and nosed neat, then after a few sips added a couple drops of water to explore it more.

Nose: This is definitely 125 proof wow! Once you get past some of the early ethanol notes the nose really opens up. Some rich sweetness is the first thing I find in here, almost like a spiced-syrupy dense cake. Definitely some spice notes in here like cinnamon and nutmeg with a bit of allspice maybe, reminiscent of Christmas. Theres a hint of something I can only describe as a little nutty, maybe like peanuts. Very interesting and complex nose. Added some water later and the woody notes appear front and center.

Palate: Amazingly rich and full of flavor. It’s got some heat but it’s very enjoyable and not overbearing nor does it get in the way of the whiskey itself. As you take a sip it opens up with the water in the mouth. Spicy and sweet, even more intense than those same notes on the nose. Some oak/char/barrel character on the back of the palate for sure.

Finish: Long and lingering, it’s quite oily and nice. Like sitting next to a fire pit on a cold night this will perk you right up as it warms you from throat to chest. Long after the sip goes down you are left with some syrupy sweet notes and oaky barrel, just great.

Value/Overall Opinion: It’s just my first barrel-proof bourbon, so I know I’ve got a lot more to explore. But, I really enjoy this whiskey it is quite beautiful. There are so many flavors to find in the nose and when you take a sip they just flood the senses. This bottle cost me $70 and I feel that’s totally fair for something this high of proof.; It’s pretty clear some care was put into creating this bourbon. Would definitely drink again and would buy again, but probably another batch to find what other tastes Booker’s can offer."
4.75,"My review of Teresa’s Batch:

*Box, bottle, and whole aesthetic presentation - no brainer; phenomenal 
*Nose - caramel, oak, warm, but soft, if that makes sense. Didn’t smell as strong as the proof would have you to believe 
*Neat Test - a lot of heat, salty peanut, vanilla, baking spice cross between cinnamon and nutmeg, good mouthfeel, and strong oaky finish
*2 cubes seems to be my perfection zone for my palate’s liking 
*1-100 - solid 94 imo 
*Final Opinion - I don’t think a 100/100 bottle truly exists, and 94 has been amongst my personal ratings for anything I’ve tried. This has undoubtedly become my favorite non-wheated juice"

3.75,"Neat in Glencairn at home.  Nose is sweet with mild spice underneath, vanilla, chestnuts, field grass.  Flavor is more of the same, with the spiciness and nuttiness coming on.  Real heat here.  A splash of water opens up some additional spices along with some faint caramel.  Decent, though not great, especially for the price."

3.5,"With all the hype and Bourbon mania sweeping the world, one of the old standards is often forgotten. Booker's put out some incredible Bourbon last year but get's left behind with all the overhyped offerings out there. Sure the price has seen a steady increase, however you can still find it for between $60-$70 and at that price it rarely dissapionts. So that brings me to this one! I was curious to see if the 2019 batches lived up to the high standard of the late 2017 batches (Kentucky Chew in particular was outstanding). Let's dive in:
Upon entry it's noticeable how much softer it is than a typical Booker's batch. Very approachable for the proof, and immediately you are hit with caramel, vanilla and brown sugar. This quickly moves to an array of baking spices with clove the most dominant. The spice lingers they the mid palette and adds oak spice and chestnuts. The finish is classic Booker's. Long with oak, peanut brittle and leather. The finish saves this batch from being a dissapiontment. 
So all in all another solid effort from Booker's but not a batch I would recommend you hunt or run out to buy unless you are a fan of spicy Bourbon. This is the spiciest Booker's batch in recent memory. Not bad at all just different. It's all in balance and well constructed. 
Cheers all!"

3.75,Vanilla wafts from the glass followed by the fusel alcohol. Oak forward. Less sweet than other vintages. Nice full mouthfeel. Sipper for sure.

Palate: Very spicy, bold, full body, sweet butterscotch
Finish: warm minty spicey"

3.5,"Nose is pretty standard for a Booker’s, which to me means astringency, caramel, and sugar. This is where it deviates from the Booker’s I’ve had before.

So image your quintessential Booker’s body. Strip all the flavors out of it except caramel. Imagine your quintessential Booker’s finish. Strip the flavors and the mouth feel, and replace it with saliva-flavored pop rocks. You got yourself a Teresa’s Batch.

I can’t really call this iteration a loss or a win. It’s miles from my favorite entry, which is currently 2015-06. But it’s not bad, it’s just remarkably bland when compared back to back with other entries in the Booker’s line. And that finishing tongue feel.... holy crap. I mean I’ve definitely never felt anything quite like it, and it’s definitely interesting. I feel like I could hear the Rice Krispies in my mouth.

I’m honestly not sure who this batch is for. Your Booker’s fans will be let down by lack of depth. Your newbies are gonna be put off by the pop rocks. Overall, I’d say this one is worth a try but not a buy. Go in with a friend."

4.25,"First bottle of Booker’s I have ever purchased and can’t say I regret it. Spicy peanut butter brittle. Very different than most bourbons on the market and I can totally appreciate that. It’s needed. The fact that I can taste the uncut/unfiltered nature of the whiskey is a cheery on top. No more to say, it’s fcuking awesome!"
