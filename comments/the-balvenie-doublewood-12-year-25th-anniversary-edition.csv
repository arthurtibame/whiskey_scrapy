4.0,"Lovely smooth sweet scotch. No smokiness, but still some complex bitter notes with a nice sweet finish"
4.0,"Nose of grapes and vanilla, very pleasant and light, with strong fruit smell. Fruit on the taste, with raisins dominating the finish. Delicious and fruity, but not super light with a finish that doesn't leave immediately"
4.0,Same as the original one.
4.0,clean finish
5.0,Sweet on the nose and insanely comfortable finish. Sort of evaporates in your mouth at the end. Highly drinkable and a great dram
