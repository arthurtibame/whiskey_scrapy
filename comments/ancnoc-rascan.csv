3.25,"A decent but inconveniently a standard one. Among the other releases of the peated collection of anCnocs the Rascan is the one to be the closest to the original 12 year old. It is obviously younger what is well expressed in a bold, audacious and sharp character but still the core of this malt remains true coconut-y sweet with vanilla sweetness with smoke-dried meat covered by the slight hint of smoke and peat.
To be honest, there is no actual peat both to the nose and to the tongue. A massive salt water mixed with sugar what makes it a bit strange in comparison to the other peated anCnocs. Also some bare barley and malt, some wood as well, leather, spice. It’s fresh, striking and heavy at the same time. Also some unripe lively green apples to the nose.
But I have no reason to call it a bad experiment or all the more a bad whisky. I liked it but I am not quite fond of the Rascan. The one obvious misfire is about the degree of peatiness - it should have been done either more or less peaty if it was about leaving to me.
Finish is sharp, smoky and malty again. Aftertaste is truly pleasant as the taste fades away evenly and so does the intensity."

3.0,"Been tasting through different AnCnoc peated expressions in search of the one I had at a bar one night.
The aroma has a lot of sweet BBQ spices, dry peat, smokey BBQ fumes, and toasted marshmallows. The palate is dry but still has the soft silky texture you associate with Ancnoc. The primary flavors are vanilla malt and powdered chocolate. The finish is dry peat smoke and earthen spices. I liked the sweet and savory smell of this whisky but it's not the one from the other night."
