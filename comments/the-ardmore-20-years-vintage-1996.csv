4.5,"A 20yo Ardmore, one of the finest and most ""hipsters"" distilleries out there. I don't think this one is too famous, bit every little thing i have tasted from them is great. This 1996 vintage, 20yo whisky is no exception to that rule. 

Bottled at 49.3%abv, with a solid burnished gold color. 

On the nose, it is impressive. Right away you get a Grassy Peat, the kind of peat from burning Moss. Smoky. 

Under that smoke there is a lot of other aroma notes: Pineapple juice, tropical fruits, yellow super fresh oranges. It feels strange to have tropical fruits on an Ardmore. 

Peat overpower the rest of the aroma notes, not in a bad way. Powerful alcohol note but not unpleasant. Burnt pineapple, dulce de leche, lemon and peaches. After a couple lf sips it releases a thick chocolate, dry brown cake aroma.

On the palate is not the best, maybe it is a little watery. Citric/tropical, lime, pineapple, dry chocolate cake. What happens on the nose, is replicated on the palate. 

Aftertaste is delicious. Peat reveals itself as ashes, smoke. Very pleasant and very balanced. 

Overall this is a very good whisky, super recommended, if you can grab a bottle of this stuff, you wont regret it. 92 over 100."

3.0,"Unremarkable, unpeated dram from Ardmore that kicked off the year 2020 as my only 20-year-old Scotch in the collection. 
This is my first expression from the distillery and although my initial impression was even more negative (notes of stale bread), it did improve with time in the glass. I need to go back to this with more wits about me to provide a proper mark, but starting here as a first impression."

4.25,"Light, smoky citrus with vanilla undertones on the nose. More sweet vanilla and fudge along some peach rounded of with a light hint of tar and salt. A really nice whisky to wind down with after a long day"

4.25,"I wish I bought a second bottle of this one right away as it is no longer available in Sweden. One of those bottles that I found myself returning to over and over without drinking any thing else from my collection.
The ex-Islay casks is Laphroaig or Bowmore (or both), since Ardmore is also owned by Beam Suntory. When I smelled the glass after it had been empty for a few hours my guess would be Laphroaig casks!"
