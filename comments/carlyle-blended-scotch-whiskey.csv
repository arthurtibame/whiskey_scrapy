3.5,Very worth the price. Found at my local Total Wine for $23 a handle and decided why not because of the current quarantine. Enjoying it quite a bit.

4.0,"I’m gonna say that I didn’t have high expectations on this whisky at $13 a bottle. However, a very pleasant surprise. A very smooth whisky along the lines of Dalmore. Oaky, buttery, honey and very floral on the nose. For $13 a bottle, it’s a fantastic buy."
3.5,"Right sweet &oak balance,  very cheap whiskey!"
3.5,Smooth and mellow
