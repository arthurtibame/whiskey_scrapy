3.5,"Century Grand store pick, Phoenix Arizona.

(This review mostly for my own notes and probably useless to those outside the AZ area and will focus on the difference between this store pick and the standard)

Nose has cinnamon, vanilla, egg cream, and overripe date. Barely a trace of ethanol, so points for that. 

Initially a fairly standard vanilla/caramel and cherry with some nice richness. Nothing in the mid-palate. Blasts from the opening sweet notes to the spicy finish in record time. Big cinnamon, mint, and oak bloom on a long finish that hits on the back of the throat. Flavors are sharp. 

Not much change from on the standard offering. Still very oaky and very hot on the finish. 

Managed to score this at Costco for $48 but even at a $15 discount, still not a rebuy. This is my 3rd try of a RR product and it seems like this line just isn’t for me. I give up."
