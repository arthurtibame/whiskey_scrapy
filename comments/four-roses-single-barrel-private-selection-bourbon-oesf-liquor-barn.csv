3.5,"Nie wiem czy to, bo wersja 53.5%. W każdym razie Single Barrel Private Selection 20% Rye. Dobre."
4.5,Mine is an OESF recipe but a Bourbon Connoisseurs pick at 57.6%. Delicious Carmel with heat. Did this one on a rock and so good. This was a good pick.
4.5,"Having not seen these available in the metro Phoenix area for the last year or so I was happy to see my local BevMo! select a barrel. This particular selection is the OESF reciepe (lower rye mash and floral yeast). It's aged for 9 yrs and 2 months and clocks in at 59.7% abv. Now, my local BevMo has a great track record picking solid store picks and the price is reasonable for this one (granted not as amazing as the price I paid with the Costco selection) so this was an easy decision to pick up. The only other recipe I have tasted is the OESK and that one was definitely a spice bomb! For this one since it has a floral yeast I am expecting softer and sweeter. On the pallette this is definitely the case. Big caramel, plum and cherry notes are initially evident. We then get mint, grass and oak. Finally on the very long finish it's a floral potpourri with the caramel and oak returning. This one is oily and goes down very easy! Much easier drinker then the Costco pick. That one really improved with ice, for this one ot would be a sin to dilute it. It's a wonderful dram as is. I think go forward this will be my go to recipe. I love the floral elements (think a cask strength IW 15)! Cheers all!"
