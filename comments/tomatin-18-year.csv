3.0,"""Muted"" is a fair comment. My preference is towards bigger whiskies (Islays, Speys), so this disappointed from that perspective. Still, very smooth and very approachable for someone who prefers something a bit lighter on the palate"

2.0,"Nose is nice but muted with notes of butterscotch, overripe fruit. Thin body. Tastes good but weak for an 18 year. Finish is short and harsh. Very disappointing. There are many 12 year scotches out there that are much better."
5.0,"Dry sherry on the palate, great nose with dark fruits and nuts, long finish, spicy oak. 46% ABV just about right for intense flavours. One of my favorite non-peated single malts so far. In comparison more depth and complexity than the Aberlour 18. And a cheaper price even."

3.0,Great nose and finish. It is very smooth but lacks a bit in the mouth feel.  Good bang for the buck I suppose but not one I'd buy again anytime soon.

3.0,"I was rather excited to see this bottle sitting on shelves here in Virginia recently.  I’ve grown quite fond of Tomatin  over the last year or so.  The 12 year, 14 year port finished, 12 year French Oak and the stellar Cu Bocan all delivered the goods they advertised while also being great deals.  So, yeah, to say I was excited to see the 18 year old locally for a very reasonable $80 is an understatement. 

It’s a beautiful caramel in color, comes in at a nice 46% and brags about Oloroso Sherry Casks on the label.  Non-chill filtered and no colorant added.  Check.  All signs point to another big BIG winner.

On the nose, heavy toffee and caramel candies start the show, sherry notes mingle with a hint of smoke just before yielding to the oak.  Smelling good.

The palate is where things fall apart:  the mouthfeel is thin, almost watery.  There’s vanilla and honey, even a bit of milk chocolate, but it turns abrasive and dry way too quickly.  The abrasive feel, heat and overwhelming dryness really turn everything on it’s heels and catches you by surprise. 

The finish is long, peppery and dry.  It had a wonderful oily look to it sitting in the glass but then, like David Copperfield, it’s pulled out from under your nose and disappears.

In the end, I’m still a Tomatin fanboy.  For $45 you can’t beat Cu Bocan and I’ve got a cask strength, single barrel 12 year to put through it’s paces, but this one falls short.  Being the most expensive of all the bottles I listed above also hurts this one.  It’s serviceable, but not really recommended.  3.5 stars.  Cheers, my friends."

3.0,"Initially has a pronounced bite for an 18 year old spirit. 
3-4 drops of water mellows the burn. 
Good flavor but more oak than sweet."
4.0,"Once upon a time the biggest distillery in Scotland was located in the Highlands with 23 running stills. Although these times are long gone, Tomatin is a name worth remembering. A bit innocent at first, the nose is fruity and creamy with honey, sweet cherries and whiffs of wood smoke. Cloves, raisins and cocoa indicate noticeable sherry influence. On the palate, the oak is taking over with lemon zest, blood oranges and strong notes of dark chocolate. The finish is easy and flawless. Altogether, Tomatin 18 is a solid Single Malt but missing that little extra.

3.0,"It's not *bad*, but ""muted"" is defintely an accurate description. Maybe even an overly generous one. This noses and tastes like it was pulled from some absolutely tired-ass casks. The fact that it spent 18 years in said casks compensates somewhat, but at the price and prestige you're paying for, that's still pretty unacceptable. Flavours are floral, heather, lavender, berries, honey. Light leather and tobacco. Grass? Faint fake popcorn butter. Surprisingly hot and spicy in the mouth for such an old spirit. Sherried, minty, slightly salty. Bittersweet."

4.0,"Out of the gate, the nose is complex but faint overall. Sweetness, light flowery elements, pineapple, pear, white grapes, and light sawdust. The palate is a great bourbon without the corn. Sweet vanilla, chocolate and caramel Reisen candies. The finish is long with an awesome buttery salted pretzel. I will score it a 3.75. The theme for this dram could be a dark or light. Maybe a hybrid like ""Jacob's Ladder"" by Rush. Thanks so much for the sample Lee!"

4.0,Freshly opened bag of brown sugar. Really delicious and full bodied. No mistaking this ones sherried
5.0,"NOSE: 90/100. Tomatin 18 has pleasant notes of rum raisin, candied walnuts, thick manuka honey, and bitter citrus (grapefruit).

PALATE: 92. Now this is where Tomatin’s thicker and natural color/non-chilled filtration provide richer flavors of dark chocolate, orange, toffee, and maple syrup.

FINISH: 90. I have to admit that the first sip of Tomatin was too spicy for me — think ginger and peppermint. It has a spicy and dry finish that opens up more flavors with a drop of water.

OVERALL: 92. Tomatin gets an extra point for the extra ABV, non-chill filtration and no color added.

VALUE FOR MONEY: Tomatin 18 is a great buy at $80 to $90 USD."

4.0,"I found this bottle at about $40 under MSRP in SC. 

Nose: Instantly a white wine, and pineapple gummy bears. A bit of oak, and sweet red fruits. Very intense sweetness on the nose.

Pallet: Honey, sweet fruit, giving way to bitter oak, ginger, and a bit of pepper

Finish: Oak forward, touch of smoke, black pepper and ginger, warming, medium length.

This is a sherry cask finish. For most of its life it was in a ex-bourbon barrel. The short time it spends in the Oloroso cask does not impart the deep rich red fruits found in something like a Aberlour, or The MaCallen. This bottle will normally run you about $100, but at the price of $60 it is well worth the money, and at 18 years it is also just a great price at $100. 

My rating is not based on price."

5.0,"Nose starts with oak and honey, followed by dark chocolate and overripe plums. It has a rich mouthfeel with more chocolate and plums. Honey does appear with a touch of oak. The finish is not overly long, oak reappears, more chocolate, plums and a surprising appearance of tobacco. Really well balanced and just delicious. This is a fantastic value for an 18 year scotch."

4.0,"Nose - Thick ""meaty"" aroma, dark chocolate covered fresh bing cherries, underlying body of a dark apple/pear cider, almost a sweet/savory similar to that of a sweet soy sauce.

Taste - White/black peppercorn fruity spice/heat, initially thin but drying that turns into a mouth coating dryness, waxy dark chocolate covered dried cherries, sweet leather/tobacco, sweet and lightly fruity soy sauce.

Finish - Lingering white pepper tingle, light salty/savory/meaty chocolate w/ a hint of dried cherry sweet.

Score - 86/100

Final Thoughts - This was quite an interesting dram. The individual components make it sound like an amazing dram, but for some reason they just don't feel very well balanced. It is a tasty dram for sure, but the flavors sort of feel like they're fighting with each other rather than working with each other. There aren't really any off putting notes, but I'll describe it like a 1000 person choir, with one or two people singing w/ a horrible head cold. It doesn't really diminish the overall effect, but there's just something that isn't tying everything together.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

3.5,"Appearance: The color of this beautiful single malt is dark copper. Its legs are extremely thin and oily.

Nose: The nose is very friendly starting out heathery honey sweet. Moss, fresh cut grass, and light peated smoke register next followed by deep fruity notes of peach and pineapple. Adding a splash of water causes more smokiness to come out.

Taste: The palate is tasty but not as full and flavorful as I was expecting. Notes of dark chocolate, orange citrus, and earthy / herbal vegetation notes please your taste buds, and by adding a splash of water an earl grey tea and pipe smoke taste emerges.

Finish: After the swallow there is a long lingering finish with an orange citrus note that stays with you for a while. 

Thoughts: I really enjoyed this whisky; I like the flavors and higher ABV (46%). I’m not sure I personally enjoy it $75+ dollars worth, but it was great to try and I am sure this scotch will be someone’s dram. Tomatin, thank you for your great work! Sláinte!"
4.0,"Color: Pale, watery gold.

Nose: Tropical fruits, pineapple, coconut, slight lime, sweet, slight oak spice in the back.

3.0,"Bottled 2017.

I’m probably going to restock on Tomatin’s 12, 15, and 18 soon.  Tomatin makes competent single malts at unbelievable prices.  I’ve seen this 18 year old as low as $70.  To be sure, Tomatin does nose and taste like an economy malt; but compared to other economy malts I’ve tried: Glen Moray, Tullibardine, Speyburn; Tomatin is actually enjoyable enough to buy a full bottle.

If I had this blind, I probably would’ve guessed it was 12-15 years old, not 18; unless I could pick up that it was Tomatin.  Tomatin distillate actually has a characterful green apple and pear fruitiness that is quite identifiable for me.  The oloroso sherry cask influence is obvious, but superficial.  The raisins, sultanas, plums, and nutmeg are on the surface of this dram, but they do not plant any roots into the base of this whisky, which is grassy and honeyed.  If you try too hard to search for a deeper meaning in this whisky, you will find flawed spices and vanilla notes from exhausted wood from a refill of a refill of a refill… This whisky is best enjoyed with only part of your attention; it is a fine dram to sip on while cooking, for example, which is fine, given the asking price.

In the end, this whisky is far from memorable; but the price is also far from being unfair.

Score: 0 (forgettable)

3.25,"After the Bushmills Steamship Sherry and the Scallwag 13 yr (Aberlour i am picking) this sherried offering is a sharp step down. 

This starts sweet and not to bad on the top palate but then as scotchinghard noted green apple like notes, bittering finish. This is my 11th Tomatin variety and personally whilst most have been middle of the road fair this one ranks near bottom. Higher than their awful 'Five Virtues' offerings. This distillery is a bit like Glenrothes, by in large they don't seem to be able to achieve anything great but when a 3rd party independent bottler like Adelphi get their hands on the distillate man it can blow you away -  4.5 rating and one of the top drams out of around 120 I sampled at Dramfest.

It really shows great spirit, poor tired overused casking used in their official bottling. I do have 1 official limited 2400 run European and North American oak bottling a 21 yr which was really nice. This blargh, there is a reason why it's one of the cheapest 18 year olds."
4.5,"On the nose it is sweet and fresh, with a light herbaceous profile that acts as a counterpoint to a profusion of ripe fruit (pineapple, peach, pear, plum), raisins infused in alcohol, Milk candy, cinnamon. In the background, a woody caress (watch out for splinters). Amiable but not pimp.
The palate is interesting, placing a bitterish tip of licorice and anise next to the sweetness of the fruit, which together with chocolate, hazelnuts and, ça va sans dire, cinnamon adds thickness to the drink. Wood becomes more present, on the threshold of invasiveness but managing to keep just one step back, drying the tongue. A certain floral freshness remains, although largely in the background.
Medium-long finish, made of wood, anise, hazelnuts, raisins.
The bitter side I admit to be a bit unsettling, and to some it could be quite repulsive, while for me it is what has given this whisky an extra gear, making it varied and fun: the sherry endings they all tend to feel the same, while here wood has contributed to give a three-dimensionality.
We are right on the edge, an extra push and everything would have collapsed (therefore, more than ever, this is a very personal feel), but for me it is promoted."
4.5,null
4.5,"Finally a good Tomatin. I have had a couple before, the cheaper core expressions and they werent anything to die for. This one is great.

Bottled at 43%abv, 

On the nose amontillado sherry (just as glenmorangie tayne) (i know that itbis oloroso sherry but for me, it was amontillado). Orange Jam and chocolate cake. It is just like Glenmorangie The Tayne but without the alcohol note.

On the palate, more of the same, Orange, Cake, Tobacco; Bitterness comes and goes. Finish is very long and seems to repeat itself in your palate, almost neverending. 

Overall i think this is a great dram, for me it is at least a 95 over 100, and if you ever drink Tomatin, be sure you start on this one."
