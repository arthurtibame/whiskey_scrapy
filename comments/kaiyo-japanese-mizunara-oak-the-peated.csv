3.75,Friendly amount of peat. Sweatness (I assume from the Mizanara) of a rich red licorice. Quite nice.

3.5,Not overly peaty
3.75,Peaty up front and on the nose. Heat in the middle but mellows our to a slight smoky finish. Good balance. Not much in terms of sweetness.
3.5,"Briny nose, the mizunara is very obvious and this whisky helped me clearly distinguish this wood influence more generally. There are hints of soy sauce or fishiness that is really obvious on the cork where it really soaked in in the bottle I picked up — almost to the point I thought something was wrong. 

There is sweetness right off the bat and it quickly turns spicier—I’m leaning towards saying it reminds me of Asian food (garlicy spices, fish sauce, some funk). I’m getting some vanilla but having a hard time picking up other flavors. Somewhat dry. Finish is relatively short. Peat is just barely there at the end and very pleasant. Takes well to water."
