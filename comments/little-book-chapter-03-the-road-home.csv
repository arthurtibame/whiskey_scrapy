4.5,"Nose: such a rich smell. I smell oranges and caramel and some oak
Palate: soooo smooth with heavy caramel and such a rich palate. It’s soooo good and changes my mind completely about the little book lineup. I need another. 
Finish: tobacco finish like 1792 full proof and it just sits there and lingers forever. 

Also the color on this is insaneeee. So dark"

4.0,"Tobacco and spice great bourbon, value for price is a little tough to justify"
3.0,"Nose - dusty corn, oak, almonds and peanuts, shoe cleaner, and vanilla.

Taste - sweet, giving off a lot of citrus and oak at the same time. Some nutty flavors. A bit of an aspartame note, but that's normally a huge bad thing but not so much here with so much oak. 

Overall I'm digging this. It would stand up well against booker's 30th in a blind tasting. I will note the whole review was with water, it really needed the water. Giving it a 3.0 vs 3.5 (booker 30th) due to how hot it drinks neat. I like the be able to drink either way and this one is less enjoyable neat. 

It's priced unpleasantly high so if you miss out, you're not missing out. Still, I think this is a huge step up from a normal bookers, but for my money I'm still getting KC single barrel."
3.0,"Decent, but it’s pretty hot and doesn’t have enough flavor to balance it out."
3.5,"Pretty good, not as dark as Chapter 01. It opens up a but with a dash of water, thin viscosity for a high ABV bourbon, balanced and rounded, finish is short with cherry, oak and mild spice."
5.0,"Appearance: I don't normally rate how a whiskey looks because it has very little to do with the taste, but this stuff is gorgeous in the glass.  A beautiful deep, dark, golden brown.  It looks rich and inviting.

Nose: Honey, cereal grains, rye spice, fruit, brown sugar, molasses.  Balanced - there's some density and complexity here but all the bourbons involved are getting in on the action.  Oak and char.  Banana.  Clove, mace, cinnamon.  Slight dill.  The proof is definitely evident on the nose.

Palate: Honey, banana, clove, hot cinnamon, mace.  Oak and char through and through.  Definitely at the upper end of the oak spectrum, but very enjoyably so.  Tropical fruits.  Pepper.  almost cumin style richness.  Oily, long finish.  Luxardo cherries.

Other notes: This is one of the most interesting bourbons I've had in a long time.  The diverse flavor profile along with the complex richness make this really special.  Every bourbon here is well represented, and the older age statements are really taking this somewhere wonderful.  Absolutely thrilled I chose this and I can't wait to share it with friends at a wedding tomorrow."

3.75,"Vanilla, caramel, sweet corn nose - classic aged bourbon.

Taste is sweet, spicey, caramel. Oaked vanilla, notes of anise and that burn!"
4.25,"Taste:  Neat 2 oz in glen cairn and then 2 drops.

Nose:  Nice rich in your face nose.  Caramel, brown sugar, and oak highlight the nose.  

Palate: Rich and oily is the first words that come to mind.  It is what a Kentucky bourbon should be.  I get cherry and caramel with brown sugar upfront.  2 drops transformed it to an almost caramel nougat.  There is an oakiness in the background.

Finish:  Finish is long and brawny.  It reminds me of older Booker's round table selections.  To that end I really appreciate it.

Overall:  The quality is there.  These are the right blended bourbons to showcase traditional Kentucky Bourbon quality.  Here is my one catch. ....  KC barrel program has put out 13-15 yr barrel picks that for 1/3 the price in my area are similar or better!  Hurts to say the distiller may have rivaled their ""one of"" release with too good a quality 120 proof bottles for $40 but that is the case.  That said LB3 is not to blame, but KC picks are its best competition!"
4.25,"This is probably one of the most anticipated releases of the fall season for me! I loved the 1st and 2nd editions and was eagerly awaiting this release! Before we dive into the notes let's find out a bit more about this release. Below is a list of the components by highest percentage used in the blend:

Knob Creek – 9 years old, 117.4 proof
Baker’s – 12 years old, 126.6 proof
Basil Hayden’s – 9 years, 123 proof
Booker’s – 11 years, 129.2 proof

SRP is $124.99 and it's highly allocated. Let's dive into the notes:

On the palette it's rich and oily! Proper KY Bourbon! Initially big burnt brown sugar, vanilla with caramel dominate with a hint of allspice. Barrel char and big oak notes dominated the mid palette with a long oak, vanilla and dried fruit and nut mix finish. It's a lovely drop and really showcases all things Beam! 

Now while this is really good there is nothing ""special"" about it. It's on par with some of the better Booker's batches but I dont know that in isolation it warrants the $40 premium. For the price I paid it's a 💯 buy! For $125 it's a marginal buy IMO. Cheers all!"

4.5,I'm in love
4.75,"A generous sample from dthom as part of the ""Whiskey transfer program"".  Dying to try this.  I LOVED Volume 1 and am a big fan of the other Jim Beam lines so this is very exciting.

Nose: Sweet dark sugars up front, orange peel, cedar, toasted almond, toasted coconut.  Smells like everything I love about volume 1 with none of the things I don't.

Flavor: Much milder than I thought at first.  Dark caramelized sugars, toasted almond and coconut, creamy mouthfeel, dark toasted wood, honey, and more orange peel.

Finish: Spicy and sweet, a lot like honey both mouthfeel and flavor, lingers for a long time with nutty woody notes.

Wow is this delicious.  Everything I like about the small batch Beam lines but turned up to 11 with the higher proof and extra aging.  Not an everyday drinker as, much like the Booker's items, you really have to be in the right mood for something this strong and powerful but wow."

3.0,"Nose (neat): Rye spice, leather, tobacco, very fine oak notes, cedarwood, salt-water taffy and roasted peanuts. Over time the nose fills out further as vanilla, caramel, mint and menthol notes emerge.
Nose (watered): A pleasant marriage of the notes that are apparent when neat, but a great deal of the bold character is lost. It tends to become merely a very nice example of the Jim Beam house nose.

Palate (neat): Big, spicy and dry arrival with a fair amount of heat. There are certainly identifiable notes such as cinnamon, dill, clove and sour cherry, but any nuance is throttled by the overly busy oak tannins. This palate is so dry, bitter and hot it is almost a caricature.
Palate (watered): Much softer arrival, still spicy and dry but the heat is tamed and the whisky is considerably more welcoming. Most importantly, the palate opens and develops to clearly display dark fruit, brown sugar, toffee, espresso and an excellent chewy woodiness. Overall water provides desperately needed balance and allows the whiskey's undeniable qualities to shine, and I thought the texture was also greatly improved.

Finish (neat): Long. Dominated by hot and bitter spices that eventually just wear off.
Finish (watered): Still long, but the bitter notes are now balanced by just the right degree of sweetness.  A dark cherry and chestnut wood flavour is distinct in the aftertaste.

When first poured neat there is a blast of ethanol on the nose - let it rest for 10 minutes and this blows away leaving the whiskey more approachable. It's authoritative but a little austere and it reminded me slightly of some dry cask-strength Speysiders I've nosed. On the whole, however, I thought it was a very good nose.

The palate, on the other hand, leaves a great deal to be desired. The arrival was promising but it quickly took a wrong turn in the development, which to me seemed more like a collapse of the arrival into a melange of bitterness. To be quite honest I thought it bordered on undrinkable.

However generous dilution completely transformed the palate, and the spirit is certainly bold enough to take water with no effort at all. I'm sure there are more seasoned bourbon drinkers than I who would love the neat palate, but for me it was just out of control and needed the discipline of water, which I thought rendered it far more elegant.

If I rated this as neat I'd give it 2 stars and consider it a failure, however with water it's a 4-star dram, so I'm splitting the difference and rating it at 3.

Many thanks to @Soba45 for the tasting sample.

""Above Average"" : 3 stars"

4.5,"Nose: Maple sugar, cinnamon, sweet oak, brown sugar.

Palate: Giant cinnamon, baking spice, and that sweet oak push in. That maple note lingers along with eucalyptus or menthol just barely there.

Finish is long and smooth with a slight Kentucky hug. This where cherry cobbler with crunchy caramelized sugars and cinnamon shine.

I could nose this whiskey all night. It is a deep and long sipper.  While it is pricey it worth all of the pennies."
3.0,"Holy crap, this will grow some hair on your chest!  It’s potent.  

First, let’s get to the blend:
- 9 year Basil Hayden
- 9 year Knob Creek
- 11 yr Booker’s
- 12 yr Baker’s

All of these are great middle age, sweet spot bourbons.  And by the potency, I’m going to assume cask strength.  I have a gut feeling that this blend is probably greater than the individual parts—-but hell, was simply too oak driven and high strength for me personally.

The nose is amazing: smoky oak and caramel.  But the taste—that’s where I got lost—-too oaky and wood driven for me.  

I had it neat—-but next time, I’ll try with a honking cube of ice...that’ll tame it down a bit"

3.5,Trying this after a Laphroaig Cairdeas meant it went down pretty smooth but as Santa found it's still a potent dram. Sadly it was a bourbon profile I'm really not fond of. Often you get the feeling a dram tastes a bit like cough medicine... this was like drinking an industrial strength version..like the lean mixture the kids drink without the lemonade. I powered through for a bit and it then tasted a bit like oaked cough syrup... which was hard to tell if it was an improvement or not. I'm with Santa aka @PBMichiganWolverine on this one...and so ends Santa Chronicle number 6..i think..i lost track somewhere..
4.5,"The color is rich amber with a caramel hue and leaves the glass coated in a thick and distinct veil of oils. The nose leads off with buttered toast balanced by ripe fruit, with vanilla and caramel following all with an underlying oakiness and a very inviting richness. The palate is right away dry but chewy, with a richness that coats the mouth along with oak, filling the mouth with butter, vanilla, caramel and a wonderful creaminess. The fruitiness takes more of a backseat but is there in the background to tie everything off. The finish is medium long with a lasting oakiness and richness that keeps the mouth feeling chewy, while a rye spiciness presents itself as the rest of the palate fades. What a wonderful experience this bourbon is."
3.0,It’s a hot mess
3.5,"This is good, but not so much as to justify the price. Strong alcohol on the nose. A little sweetness on the front given over to a mineral like finish. The finish is long as you would expect for the finish. Much better cask strength options out there for the money."

3.25,"Buttered cinnamon toast that was cooked a bit too long. Spiced pipe tobacco, too. Smells how I’d want to, ya feel?

Also, had to abandon ship a little early BC my ex-girlfriend walked into the bar I was in the night I’m proposing? 
I don’t really taste the proof...except maybe a slight burn on the finish. It’s surprisingly not-complex. But, enjoyable. Kinda snickerdoodle-y. 

Look, I had a thought of what this would taste like, and it didn’t super do that. Always kind of afraid the bartender didn’t give me what I asked for when I didn’t see the pour???"
4.5,"I couldn’t disagree more with the distiller reviewer here.  Describing this as smoky and fruity with no structure is extremely puzzling to me.  I get the beam peanut brittle, chai tea spice, cinnamon, honey, and clove on there 
nose. The proof is definitely apparent but isnt distracting or overwhelming. The palate offers a kick of rye spice up front quickly followed by a sweetness of brown sugar and caramel to balance out the sip.  The finish has hints of bananas foster, vanilla icing and creme brûlée. While I think there are some batches of bookers and KC 14-15 store picks that are marginally better than this, an 81 ranking is way off and the description of smokiness and floral notes perplex me even further. There is some rye spice in here but I just don’t even come close to those notes here.  I’d love for another reviewer to restate this as I believe it is a quality offering and worth $89-99 if you enjoy bakers/bookers beam in general"

4.5,"This is fantastic. Hard to believe it's over 120 proof. I get almost no alcohol on the nose or palate. Lots of vanilla cream, burnt sugar and cinnamon on the nose. Creamy mouthfeel with no alcohol burn. Creme Brulee, cinnamon, cherry syrup and oak on the palate with a hint of mint that leaves your mouth tingling. Long, medium-dry finish. This doesn't punch you in the mouth like Booker's, it caresses your taste buds and leaves you begging for more."
4.75,"Glencairn neat at Breezy's, then another strong pour in a little Bowman snifter neat at home, both courtesy of - and along with - Matt the Lion.  

Spicy yet smooth, alcohol well masked, just delicious.  Great mouth-coating spices, with vanilla and char adding to the punch.  This is like a super Baker's cask strength blend for me.  Awesome.  11/16/19

Edit: I liked it enough to drive today after work to a pop-up VA ABC holiday kiosk at a busy mall (torture, just torture) to buy a bottle after having tasted it.  $124.99 is a tough ask, but on this one, I was happy to pay it."

Delicious. This one in a blind pour-off of Baker’s 13, Little book 3, and ECBP. Nice nose with a balance of sweetness and dry oak. The palate is chock full of different flavors... dried fruits, peanuts, and more drying oak, to name a few. The finish is long and warming, with a beautiful creamy mocha starting it out along with hints of baking spices and again revisiting that dry oak note."

3.0,"Another weekend on lockdown. Family movie time and some whiskey.  This comes to me to longtime whisky pal across the other side of the the Hudson, @PBMichiganWolverine .

The nose is dense with a mix of aromas found in single barrel bourbons.  Nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, dill spices.  Sweetness of butterscotch , licorice, peanut brittle, cherries seep through the spice.  All of this is encased with oak wood. 

The initial sip is a blast of spice and wood and lidocaine.  Subsequent sips become easier to discern flavors and the palate acclimates.  Dominated by wood spices and tannins, whisps of vanilla, cherry NyQuil, ground cinnamon, cloves and dill. 

The cherry NyQuil flavor remains on the palate with a wooden dryness, spearmint that with a timeless end.

A healthy dose of water softens the spicy edge and the buried sweetness is unveiled.  Dark brown sugar, caramel, coffee, and bitter dark chocolate. 

A potent whisky that is better developed and formed with the addition of water.  However, overall, the whiskey seem very restricted, bound and wanting to be more and find itself.  Not a bad dram, but I was anticipating more from a single barrel whiskey.  A better experience can be had with Elijah Craig Barrel Proof it Four Roses Single Barrel.  Stay well. Stay safe. [84/100][Tasted: 3/4/20]"
