5.0,"Living in north LA I rarely have an opportunity to get in on a limited release like this. I was in Houston this weekend and the stars aligned! Spec's on Holcombe received the Knob Creek 2001 batch #2 the same day I walked in. At $125 it's a huge bourbon purchase for me, although after the first nose I was very glad I picked it up. The vanilla and sweetness floods the nose along with charred oak. The nose carries to the pallet filling the mouth with a luscious spicy oak filled finish. This is one I truly wish were more affordable.  

 Red white and brews, Hammond, LA,  $100 batch 1

4.5,"Neat. Bottle kill review.  Batch 1.This bottle has been my friend for awhile but all good things come to an end.  It’s my daughter’s 7th b-day and I have decided to kill the last 4 ounces tonight.  Perfect time for a review.  

An amazing cherry note on the front mixed with vanilla frosting and a hint of nuttiness.  Brings back memories of my grandparents and their favorite cafeteria restaurant.  It had this vanilla pudding, cherry pie covered in crushed peanuts.  The graham cracker pie crust is there too.  I love this nose.

Mouth feel is super oily but a bit thin too.  The oily part dominates later though.  Really getting punched by the oak tonight.  Starts out light and bright with the vanilla and the oak drops like anvil.  Vanilla lingers and that cherry comes around more on subsequent sips.  The nuttiness is very very very subtle.

Still a great pour.  Since I bought this bottle a consistent wave of 14-15 year 120 proof store picks have been around my area.  While I love the nose on this, the taste is just okay compared to those store picks.  That brings my score down a peg."

3.0,"Despite Knob Creek's marketing for this bourbon, I received batch #4.  I still can't find any info online regarding batches 4 and 5, other than people like me who are reporting snagging a bottle.
      
      This is a nice bourbon with great color and a luscious aroma wherein the brighter youthful notes have become mellowed, blended, and velvety.  If you're seeking an older bourbon, you're probably hoping for strong oak notes on the palate, and while this one's got them, they are on the subtler side and are accompanied by notable astringency (I wonder if this had anything to do with their decision to dump the barrels at this point) that battles with the vanilla sweetness and burn, which is there even with a healthy dose of water and persists through the medium-length finish.  Definitely a nice whiskey and tastes like its age, but my rating scale factors in value, and for me, this isn't as good as the equivalently priced (if/when you can get it) Pappy 15 year.  If price isn't an object, go for it, but don't expect a miracle!  It was easier for me to appreciate the subtlety of the aged characteristics drinking this after a much younger whiskey."

4.0,"Batch 2. Smells glorious, with vanilla, butterscotch, and sugar, some fresh scent notes that I can't put a finger on. Very smooth on the palate, sweet but not cloying. So silky. Sharp wood notes and a bit of spice and bitter chocolate on the back end. Great warmth in the throat. This is a nice pour, although the finish is a bit short, and while not simple, overall it seems a bit thin. Too expensive for an every day pour, but I certainly wish it could be. This is a credit to Fred Noe. 3/5/17
I'm down to the end of the bottle now. The nose is still wonderful, if not more so than when I first opened the bottle. Doesn't feel as thin, and the bitter notes are a bit more pronounced. But otherwise the flavor profile is the same, thankfully. Say what you may about the price, which is understandable, but just judging the juice, it's hard not to like this bourbon. 8/28/17"

4.0,I had the last pour of this bottle. It was pretty sweet with some vanilla.
5.0,"TIP / ALTERNATIVE: Go for the higher 120 proof 13yo Single Barrel instead for just $40.
    At $40, it was a much better deal and arguable the better bourbon, with the  higher proof of the Knob Creek Single Barrel *SELECT* (selected by Liquor Mart Whittier in my case) which was selected from one of the 13yo barrels, as many of the barrel select versions are, clocking in at just 1 year under the 14yo Knob Creek 2001, while retaining the higher 120 instead of 100 proof, and being Single Barrel instead of Small Batch like the 2001! 
      At times I even prefer it over my all-time-favorite Booker's Bluegrass, when both brought down to around the same proof with a few drops of Kentucky Limestone water.
  Knob Select can be found at quite a few places via 1000Corks.com, but just be sure to call to confirm the barrel age if not stated on the website."

4.25,"Batch 2

Color: Dark Auburn

Nose: grain, honey, oak and baking spice, caramel and vanilla, toffee and some orange peel, slight ethanol at the end but overall a great nose!

Palate: brown sugar, leather, honey, oak, caramel and slight butterscotch, cinnamon spice finish and linger, a warm Kentucky Hug - way far in the back there is a slight hint of the Beam funk. 

100 proof and 14 years did this Knob Creek some service. The price tag of ~$130 is a hard pill to swallow, thankfully I received this bottle when I worked for Beam."

2.75,"Meeting some old friends who are in town on business for dinner and whilst I was waiting in the hotel lobby I decided to check out the Whiskey selection. The first thing that caught my eye is they had the Birthday Bourbon but wanted $60 for a pour! So of course that was a hard pass. I saw this one and almost didn't bother asking, but figured what the heck. When the bartender said $13, I instantly pulled the trigger. Not only is this a rare bottle but is north of $150 even at retail, the price for the pour was outstanding! 
Unfortunately my excitement was short lived. 
For reference I am reviewing Batch 1, bottle # 148, distilled in 2001 and bottled in 2016. 
On the pallette, it's smooth and oily with some vanilla and toffee, but then the oak smacks you in the face. It's really hard to get past as it's really pronounced. As I tried to pull other notes, I got a hint of tobacco and clove but again then oak is super dominant. It's very smooth and has better viscosity than the regular Knob, but the amount of oak is out of balance. 
I have heard the quality of the batches vary greatly and I would advise folks to pass on batch 1. I am sure others are better, but I find it hard to imagine any would come close to justifying the high price of admission. 
I am big fan of the Knob Single Barrel offerings and those are not only a better value, but honestly a better Bourbon all together. The last one I reviewed was 14 yrs old and was oak heavy, but it at least had a good compliment of notes. Hard Pass on a purchase. If you can find a pour for close to what I paid, it's an ok value. Otherwise pass on the pour. My rating is based on the price I paid for the pour. At $150+ a bottle, I would drop it to 2/5. 
After dinner, I went back for one more pour just to make sure pallette wasn't off the first go around. Same experience! 
Cheers all!"

4.25,"Butterscotch nose. Semi-oily, moderately sweet and a decent amount of wood. Sophisticated and a bit fruity. Honestly, this is unique and exquisite. 4.3."
5.0,"Body: looks fairly heavy and clings to the glass. The color is a healthy dark brown like lighter maple syrup. 

Nose: Caramel, apples, vanilla, cinnamon rolls.

Palate: with just a sip on the tip of my tongue and lips it tasted like aromatic tobaccos. Exceptionally smooth mouth feel. Sweet corn, toasted oak, and nuts. Very little burn and the sweetness lingers with a variety of tobaccos, oat, and just a touch of the rye. Two drops of water awoke more a char and vanilla caramel notes. Absolutely superb. 

Finish: cinnamon, a very strong and enjoyable toasted oak, and fried apples. 

Overall: I hate that I opened this, but at the same time I am overjoyed by the product. It’s delicious and I wish it was more readily available. If it was I’d guzzle this bottle and find another one immediately. As it is, I will be taking my time."

Bottle #2066

Rye is VERY pronounced adding tons of spice and heat to the palette but soft notes of vanilla and brown sugar hide behind the strong spice overtones and become more easily accessible as the spirit opens up.

Plenty of oak character, hints of char and cloves. Everything I want in a bourbon."

5.0,"Delicious!  Found this at a whiskey bar in North Carolina (hunkering down and having a glass waiting for Florence) with a live jazz band.  Rich maple syrup and vanilla on the nose with no burn whatsoever after opening up for about 10 minutes.  On the palate, it is similar to the nose with just a little spice and mild heat.  Reminiscent of a wheated bourbon such as Weller 12 in my opinion.  Finish is medium if not a little short.  My only complaint was that it is too easy to drink and my glass was empty way too quickly. Higher price point but worth it if you have $ to spend."

4.75,"Nose packs a punch, but delivers some quintessential bourbon flavors. There’s honey, caramel, and sugar.

Body is softer and mellower when it first hits, then strikes with a good deal of heat. That transition of the mouth feel is interesting. Not sure how they did that. The flavor on the body is subtle. A tad of cinnamon, some tea leaves. A bit of lemon in the sharpest moments. 

Finish delivers on the citrus flavor, with heavy cinnamon.

I’m always fascinated when a bourbon can surprise you. Nose has caramel? Screw you brah, body is gonna have citrus. The mouth feel transition during the body is also fascinating. Bookers has done some screwy stuff like this over the years, but this knob creek is something special. Very glad I got this bottle!"

2.75,"Lets open with laughing at whatever idiot gave this a 95 on distillers.  

Anyway, after the massive failure that was the 25th anniversary I thought it would be fun to go ahead and try the 2001.  As we all know Knob Creek has become really well known for the insanely good store picks that are coming out often with 14-15 year age statements.  This 14 year at 100 proof however is likely going to be a huge failure.  

It's bourbon so looks don't matter.

Nose is classic bourbon.  Slightly nutty, vanilla, oak, light fruits, and maybe a touch of a custard.  

The flavor brings a lot of oak, not the old rich leather oak but just a lot of fresh cut oak, vanilla of course, it's a really good quality bourbon.  

Finish is medium, nothing special again.  

More or less this is knob creek 9 year old with a touch more oak and quality.  It's nothing more than that though.  The standard single barrels are often better, not even the older store picks.  

That said unlike the 25th, this is very good bourbon.  It's just 120 bucks which is a joke."
