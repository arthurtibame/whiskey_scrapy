4.0,"I think this is really good. For being a bourbon it has a Whistlepig 10 flavor to it, not sure of the rye content but it tastes closer to straight rye than a low rye bourbon."

3.0,"Butter, toffee and baking spice and a hint of peach but in a savory way with a long dry spice finish. It’s good but not my favorite flavor profile, almost rye-ish in its spice."
4.0,"Nose: opens up with light butterscotch tones then moves into bright fruity smell with a bit of pear

In the mouth: Medium body not very complex (young whiskey). Slight heat. A bit of butterscotch and a hint of apricot as it sits on the tongue. 

Finish: honey and spice with just a peek of pear. Spice lingers 

Very drinkable. Not exactly what I would think of for a “bourbon” but for a $35 bottle I think it’s super drinkable. I will definitely keep a bottle of this on hand."

3.5,"The color is amber but not as vibrant as you would expect in older bourbons. It does have legs that hang on and take their time making their way down the glass. The nose reveals some youth but also gives hints burnt toast, oak, orange zest and a touch of clove. The nose all carries over into the palate with a somewhat rich mouthfeel. The finish has more oak come out but is medium at best."

3.0,"Has a good range of flavors, but the alcohol bite is stronger than some bourbons that have higher abvs."
