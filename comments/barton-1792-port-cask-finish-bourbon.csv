1.0,Was not a fan at all. Sweet wheat and regular 1792 are both exceptional bourbons. This was a disappointment.

2.0,"I find myself wanting to like all of the 1792's and then when I find them, buy them, and then try them, I find myself wanting just a little more out of them. So far the regular small batch is my favorite and after trying the sweet wheat and port finish, which both seem to be backed by this medicinal cough syrupy finish that must be common with 1792, I see no need to ever stock anything other than the small batch."

3.0,"Great nose, classic bourbon notes plus the fruit from the port. Smooth, light, velvety. Sweet, with some vanilla and damp wood notes. Some sweet cereal as well. Slight spice. 10/27/17"

2.0,"Doesn't even come close to other Port finished bourbons like Angel's Envy. I wanted to love this, due to Angel's Envy being a top 3 favorite of 50 bourbons, whiskeys and ryes, however, I can't stand it in the same way I can't stand 1792 Small Batch. That is due to its Scotch-like finish of  leather, tobacco, and peat - dry and tannic. I usually drink neat, but ice or water doesn't help either. Go for Angel's Envy or Midwinter NIght's Dram instead if you want a Port finish, unless you really like 1792 bourbon in general.Extremely overpriced at $100 in Seattle - in the rare cases when you can even find it."
4.0,"Another bourbon I consumed in a flurry of day drinking after working overnight.  It was generously supplied by my buddy, Ryan.  Many thanks, bro.

I really enjoyed the small batch and sweet wheat offering from 1792, and I thoroughly love port finished, single malt scotch so I was really, really excited to try this one.  Sadly, I don't think it was finished for very long or the Port casks weren't of the best quality.  It's a testament to how good the base whiskey is that I'm still inclined to give it a solid score because I didn't get much (if any) Port wine notes.  It's sweet, but so was the sweet wheat, it's pretty smooth, but so was the small batch, so where does that leave this?

It's a tasty bourbon, that's where.  I could've kept topping off the tasting glass and lost count of pours quite easily.  That speaks volumes about 1792 as a whole.  Whether or not you need the batch variations is a matter of personal choice and depth of your wallet.  You can't go wrong by picking this or any other 1792 offerings IMO.  Go get one or two and see for yourself.  Cheers."

3.25,"Excited to try this as I 'm a fan of the 1792 lines but I tend not to like the less aged items and am super in to the Full Proof and even more so the 12 Year.

Nose:  Toasted pecan, dark caramelized sugar, vanilla, dried cherries.

Flavor: Lacking the harshness from the ethanol of the standard 1792 bottlings.  Sweeter as well.  Dark dried red fruits, vanilla, caramel, a little bit of barrel funk that I associate with fortified wine finished whiskey, and very little alcohol bite.

Finish:  Medium short, a little spicy and nutty, a little drying as well.  A little bit of funk that is somewhere between stinky weed and skunk that I found just a hair off-putting but not enough that I hated it.

Overall I liked it and I'd drink it again.  If I found a bottle at MSRP (Yeah Right!) I'd buy it but not at secondary."

4.0,Smooth with a subtle finish of heat from the port. 12/16/18 Sample
3.5,"Fun variation on the base 1792. A little sweeter, a little more complex. Not amazing whiskey, and certainly not worth secondary-market prices, but a respectable and unusual dram. 

We were gifted a bottle, and it's been worth having. It's most enjoyable now, as the port-flavors go well with fall-into-winter days. It's the dram I chose to sip on while decorating for Christmas, if that helps put it into it's place.

There aren't a lot of port-finished bourbons on the market (though the number is quickly escalating). Of the three I've had, I prefer the Angel's Envy port-finished to the 1792, though the 1792 comes out well ahead of the Abraham Bowman Port-finished. I haven't had all three in the house at the same time to do a blind tasting, so that's based on memory, but for most things the Angel's Envy should be the go-to--it's not worth the time to track down the 1792."
