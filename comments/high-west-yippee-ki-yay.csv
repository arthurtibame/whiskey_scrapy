3.75,Red fruit with a rye note. An orange citrus note and black pepper on the nose.  Easy sipping with a touch of vanilla and red fruits up front some black pepper mid palate and finishing with some oak and a hint of honey

3.0,"So, this is interesting and I'm glad I bought a bottle.  But not sure I'd buy it again."
4.25,"Neat.  Open for more than 6 months.  Full disclosure, last time I had this I also ate bad food and the food poisoning took me down for two days.  My body associated the poisoning with the vermouth.  This is my first attempt at trying this again....

On the nose, the vermouth dominates (and I survived!) and doesn’t leave much room for the rest of the Whiskey.  I am getting vanilla and toasted almond.  Little raisin.  Not much else.

The mouth feel is smooth and thick despite the lower proof.  Mmm, okay I like this a lot.  The vanilla comes through so bright and vermouth complements it nicely.  Toasted almond is hinted at but the vanilla is king here and comes back on the finish.  Finish lasts quite a while too.

Ah so glad I could try this again.  I waited awhile, not to dare my body to self inflict a negative reaction.  It’s such a solid, interesting dram.  There is a lack of complexity but the flavors it has are so nice."
3.75,"Smooth on the nose, licorice, extremely smooth rye- highly highly recommend for a rye drinker!"

3.0,"What do you know - the vermouth finish produces a rye that smells and tastes like a Manhattan. I haven't yet tried it in an actual Manhattan but for a neat drink I'd rather something that was more spice forward. Here, the aniseed undertones are cut with maraschino cherries."

5.0,Damn. This is a close second to Midwinter nights dram. For the money I would take this. Such complexity finishing in vermouth and syrah casks. Love when high West experiments. It cuts through the usual harsh finish of the double rye (which I didn't mind to begin with) and mellows it a bit on the finish.  Good stuff. Damn near impossible to buy. Had a shot at a bar in salt lake.

Astringent on the palate, sweet spices, mostly hot cinnamon, more cherry. Drying finish with some bitter wood. Mostly uninspiring, but a big thanks to the resplendent Pranay for the generous sample! Dry glass: soft green wood and a hint of powdered cocoa."

4.0,I enjoyed this! I've enjoyed every High West. This was like drinking an Old Fashioned or Manhattan without all the theatrics of putting it together. The vermouth came through strong at first but was silenced by the Syrah. I enjoyed this and would recommend especially if looking for a drink to have on a daily basis and treat as a cocktail.

4.0,"High West, if nothing else, does have a knack for making the sum of its parts greater than the individual.  Midwinter really blew me away, probably one of the top 5 of my all time favorites.  This one is good, but not anywhere close to Midwinter.  While the signature in Midwinter was the Christmas mulling spices, this one's calling card is maraschino cherries.  If I were to rank my top ryes, it would be clearly Midwinter by far as #1, followed by Crown Royal Noble Collection.  This might round out out my top 5 ryes...but I've only had 5 ryes..."

4.0,"Nose - Very herbal nose of sweet mint, sage, rosemary, thyme. Like an herb infused manhattan that used vermouth that had crushed blueberries seeping in it. Oddly a hint of pine, but what is almost like pine sol.
Taste - Fruity cinnamon herbs, strong initial vermouth, cherries and unripe, slightly bitter dark berries, burnt sage. Like a very herbal manhattan.
Finish - Lingering bitter cherry vermouth, lightly tannic like that of a deep dark red wine. Hint of burnt orange rind bitterness, sweet mint, and this faint sweetness that's almost like a lychee.

3.0,"Pretty lean nose: allspice, cloves, orange peel. Needed a bit of time to open up, was all acetone and alcohol to begin with. Ten minutes later it gets into vanilla and fudge. Twenty minutes in and I'm getting a lot of tobacco on the nose. Very odd.
      Palate: pretty firey (surprisingly so for 92 proof), cherry boiled sweets, rye spice, cinnamon and those cloves again.
      Finish: raisins, soft but lingering.
      Verdict: it's interesting alright, tastes very young though. All the interesting flavour is pretty superficial. Decent."

4.0,"(batch 11) - when deciding what to have this evening I stumbled upon this unopened bottle on my Rye shelf and decided this was the right time. I am a huge fan of the port finished AMND (High West, not had Glenmorangie's yet) and also love the base Rendezvous Rye. As I love the Double Rye I was excited to try this, the DR finished in Vermouth and Syrah.

Nose is spice with dark fruit; woody notes. Palate enters raisins, dark fruit; the influence of the Vermouth and Syrah is notable. The finish goes on long enough and has an almost a dessert raisin and fig character.

Another winner, highly recommended 92-94."

3.0,"An interesting wine finished Rye! Upon entry you immediately taste the wine influence with bursting red fruits and vanilla. Rye and clove swell at their pallette with a meduim dry finish. Again the wine plays a big part in that. At $70 or more it's hard to justify the price over the extremely solid double rye this is based on. You can get that for less than $30! I also prefer the barrel select double Ryes finished in either wine or boulivardier casks. Again, this is a solid Rey, just hard to swallow the price."

On the pallette you immediately get hit with a big burst of red fruits and vermouth, that quickly transitions to clove and cinnamon. The finish is long with oak, pepper, rye and hints of grape and and rasberry that come in and out. Finally you get mint. It really is a lovely pour. So unique. Really nothing else has a similar taste profile. Another winner for High West!"
