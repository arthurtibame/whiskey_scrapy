3.0,"I’ve been through two bottles of this. The first bottle was batch one, and was the best rye I’ve ever had. The second was batch two and I won’t be finishing that bottle."

3.5,"On the nose: Smells like a young, underripe rye. Most likely because I’m unfamiliar with aspen wood and how it smells/tastes. Small hint of sweet vanilla.

Taste: Spicy at first as it draws you through the middle of an aspen tree. Slightly floral, peppery, and slightly bitter because of the aspen wood. Bitter is not bad! It’s nice to let the Rye spice breathe instead of covering it with oak. This is a fun one.

Finish: Spicy, slightly sweet, and slightly bitter and earthy from the aspen. Almost finishes earthy."
