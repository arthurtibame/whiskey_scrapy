3.0,"Smells like tropical fruit, hay, toffee, and vanilla. The palate is sweet and rich, with more development of what is found on the nose. For a younger malt, this dram carries its weight. A nice everyday Irish. Cheers Josh!"
null,Purchased with Nathan Branham in honor of a terrible week at work.

3.0,"Nose- sweet notes of plum and molasses
Body- vanilla turns to black pepper
Finish- sweetness linger but gives way to an astringent rawness
Note- Nit bad but could use some aging"
3.0,A little rough. Nose smells like apples and shoe polish. Mouth: Spicy. Sweet - juicy tropical fruit. Finish is heavy on grass and again this weird shoe polish taste. ...but it grows on you.

3.0,"Nose is somewhat floral, but otherwise quite oak heavy. The mouthful is warm and robust. There are some faint notes of apples and honey on the palate until a slight bitterness sneaks in towards the end. The finish is short, oaky and a little disappointing."
1.0,"How do you even begin to evaluate a whisky that first nosing reminds you of dusty old books? I doubt anyone in the history of humankind has wanted to drink a spirit that reminds them of being trapped in an abandoned library. And while I could try elaborating on some of the other aromas, like peaches and walnuts, in the end... I hate this thing. God have mercy on my mouth."

3.0,"Chocolate notes on the nose.  Similar palate and finish to Jameson Caskmates Stout, but slightly less friendly and at a higher price."

3.0,"[Whiskey Live NY 2018] - I'm not sure what has happened to this malt over the years, or if it's just me.  Barely holds a candle to what I tasted throughout the expo."

3.75,"Nose: Grassy notes. Some oak and smoke. Caramel and vanilla notes. Citrus fruits. 

Palate: Vanilla and cinnamon. Slightly fruity, apples and oranges. Smokey and strong. Slight peat flavor.

Finish: Medium. Smokiness lingering with hints of cinnamon and citrus.

Overall Thoughts: A very pleasant single malt. Tastes lovely and isn’t too powerful or overbearing. For a young whiskey, it’s very impressive and I enjoy it. I’ll make the bottle last and I’m excited to try more Glendalough. They’d already impressed me with their Poitín, and now their 7 year will always be in the cabinet!"
4.5,Smooth and fruity
