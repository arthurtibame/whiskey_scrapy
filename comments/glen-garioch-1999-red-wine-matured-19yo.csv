5.0,"Oh this is a great dram. Lately i have tried some expressions from this distillery and they are all good. This one is a 1999 vintage, 19 year old, Red Wine Cask matured. A jewel. 

Bottled at 48%abv. Deep copper color.

On the nose, wine, raisins, cherries, cinnamon, chocolate bathed raisins and coconut. AMAZING. 

On the palate another perfect score. Chocolate, mixed with prunes and red fruits. Dulce de leche and vanilla ice cream .

Aftertaste is a lot different but it is so clean and delightful. Bitter tobbacco. Red fruits. 

Overall this is a superb dram. If you can find any bottle, just grab it. It is perfect, my score for it is 100 /100. Sláinte!!"
