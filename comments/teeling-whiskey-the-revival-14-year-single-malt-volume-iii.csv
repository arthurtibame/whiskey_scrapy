4.0,"I've been trying to come up with something witty here, but this is just solid, good whiskey. Similar to the frankly disappointing single cask Teeling I had a while ago, there is a distinct white peach fruitiness here, but unlike that release (a white port cask), there is much more going on here. The dram evolves in the glass - an immense topsoil note presents itself immediately...a really deep earthiness. With a few minutes to breathe, this retreats and allows that fruitiness, along with woodiness, marshmallow-like sweetness and vanilla. This is a standout in the world of Irish whiskey, quite distinctive and and a testament to how Teeling's usage of unique barrels (I had to look up pineau de Charent) can yield memorable results."

4.0,"Finishing in French fortified wine casks lends the 3rd of the Revival whiskies from Teeling has leant this otherwise tame whisky a breadth and scope that fills your palate with rich dried fruits.
Sweetness of honey on the nose is wrapped with a delicate dark chocolate hint of bitterness. Hazelnut notes add a creaminess and body that lends the caramelised pineapple mid notes, that slowly trend into something soft and lingering.
At 46% the sweetness and balanced body hide the ethanol, allowing this to be both rich and easy drinking."
