3.0,"This is really interesting- it's sweet but not in a toffee/vanilla heavy way, instead it's incredibly light like a delicate thin fruit juice. It's clear and bright, with moderate burn. The nose is off-putting to me, astringent, which knocks it from a 4 to a 3. The ""hay"" note might be right on. Not that rich caramel some have. Still, it pairs nicely with rich foods, cheese and chocolate because it's so clear and fine. Like pears and green grass and a touch of honey."

Initially very faint, subtle nose, but opened beautifully with a half-teaspoon of water, revealing baked pears with a touch of cinnamon-sugar and cocoa and something herbal, earthy, elusive... Anise? Dill? Faraway hint of pine smoke. It then bursts wide open on the palate with bold, buttery, chewy malt and vanilla. Bittersweet citrus and milk chocolate carries into the quickly calming finish, leaving your head spinning. Surprisingly complex and enjoyable for the age and price! I'd put it between Glenfiddich 12 and Old Pulteney 12 for character. Dry glass: candied pecans."

4.0,"Sweet, salty, caramel are flavours popping up into the mind. Aftertaste medium length on the back-sides of the tongue and throat. Warm at the back of the throat"
2.0,"Nose: Salt, malt and honey. The briny character becomes more apparent as you focus on it, giving the nose an overall zesty nature. There's leathery and grassy aromas as well.

Palate: Nutty, salty and a touch spicy. Cereal and a light sweetness that starts to turn bitter. The palate increases in intensity as it develops but it gains a quite salty character that intrudes too much for my liking.

Finish: Medium/Long: After peaking, the palate starts a slow slide out and fades away with bitter walnuts and brine.

Not particularly complex or interesting, in fact rather 2-dimensional. The brine aspect is very prominent and seems to become more so over time. It's acceptable but I wouldn't recommend it or buy it again.

Jura has always been a problem for me as they have consistency issues. I don't mind variation between batches (in fact I welcome it) but the variation needs to be centered around a defined character. Jura seems to produce wildly differing batches of the same expression, and there is even more variation between expressions - it's like there are a dozen ""house styles"" of new-make, and none is particularly enjoyable.

 ""Acceptable"" : 2 stars"

3.0,"Origin is a 10-year old whiskey that has a similar price point to Superstition, its sweeter, richer cousin.  Compared to Superstition, Origins seems not to have as much (if any) sherry-cask aging.  Its sweetness is mellower and features a variety of fruits, including caramel-covered green apple (think Halloween) and pear.  Although it's considered unpeated, there seems to be a touch of smoke on both the nose and the palate.  In contrast to the fruit-forward nose, its flavor profile isn't far off Bowmore 12, with a slightly dull or almost metallic quality to its maltiness, just less smoke.  I noticed some notes in the tea vein, with dried, vegetal, slightly bitter, aromatic properties.  At around $50 a bottle, Origin is an interesting and unusual expression, not easy to categorize.  I prefer Superstition among the two entry-level Juras."

I imagine Islanders bursting with brine and salt.   Taste:  better, now getting some Island DNA.  Still, disguising itself as a Speysider.  Finish:  quick, and bitter.   Interesting.  Tasted blind, I'd think a young Speysider."

3.0,"A cold and crisp Sunday evening finds me in front of the wood stove where streaming 1980’s music is playing.  And so, I find myself reminiscing about my days of yore with the Jura 10 in my hands, provided through a small group of mates on a scotch journey: the SDT (thanks Lee).  The atmosphere is all perfectly set for a nice, complex, contemplative dram.  Alas, this would not be the case.

The nose is rather faint.  An earthy, mineral quality forms a soft aromatic foundation.  Honey, sweet tea with a slight maltiness are most dominant; the qualities one may find in a Highlander, not an Islander.  The liquid has a very thin mouthfeel with the simple flavors of honey, sweet tea, with oranges or tangerines.  A small amount of maritime saltiness can be detected.  All this simplicity leads to a short finish.  Small amount of oak-drying tannins remain, with a touch of orange bitters and toffee.

This is a rather simple whisky that does venture much beyond the parameters of itself, from nose to finish, it is the same profile: tea, honey and citrus.  This would possibly be slightly improved and a bit more complexity with a punched-up ABV, say 43% to 46%.  It’s not a bad dram, just not a sophisticated one.  It makes a nice summer sipper or an introductory single malt.  [Dry Glass: Sweet tea with lemon][84/100][Tasted: 3/5/17]

*200th Distiller Note."
3.0,"Stop number 4 on the SDT is Isle of Jura. This is the only distillery on the island of Jura, which is sparsely populated (under 200 people per Wikipedia). It is a minimum 40% ABV, it is chill filtered and has colorant added that creates a deep amber color. 

The nose is quite malty with a good amount of honey. Light fresh oak and cardboard. Earthy and vegetal with underripe fruits like berries or melon. Thick toffee and syrup with a bit of roasted nuts and vanilla. There is also some lemony citrus. After time in the glass I got a brief hit of coffee grounds. 

Light and malty on the palate. Light fruitiness and pepper. Semi sweet. A hint of smoke but not nearly enough in my opinion. A fairly boring dram. 

More oily than expected for the mouthfeel considering that its chill filtered, but it is light bodied. The finish is medium short with light oak and toffee. 

This was my first offering from Jura so I didn't know what to expect. Everything about this single malt screams Highland or Speyside. Not at all like an Island whisky. It's very light and kind of jumbled. I would not recommend this to anyone that is a peat head or likes stronger flavors. Not a bad option to keep in the bar for your friends who want a whisky but don't want a WHISKY lol. Thank to Lee for the sample."
2.0,null
2.0,"So, I'm finally getting around to sampling my first offering from the tour group:  Jura 10.  I've seen bottle art depicting this offering as Origins 10, but my bottle doesn't indicate anything about Origins.  A little research and I believe the bottle I have is a newer blend from the distillery and they chose to drop the wording from the bottle label.  Apparently, they dropped some flavor from it, too.

It's a standard 40% ABV and is chill filtered and has color added- all strikes against it in my book.  It's your typical golden, burnt honey in color and offers only minimal sweet sherry notes on the nose.  The bottle says American white oak bourbon casks were used to fully age it and it was finished in Oloroso sherry barrels.  The oak used must've been from poorer quality barrel staves because there isn't much spice, pepper or heat detected on the tongue at all.  It's so overpowered with sherry and watered down to reach the 40% that it almost tastes like the sweetness is artificial.

The finish is medium in length and bitter and I keep topping off my Glencairn simply because I want the bottle gone.  It isn't disgusting it just isn't the bottle you want lingering on the bar top because you would certainly not be reaching for it when you crave a dram or two.  Therefore, it would just sit there and there are too many great single malts out there for that.

So, in essence, this is a bit of a dud.  I've had a couple of NAS Jura bottles that were much better than this and that's were I recommend everyone gravitate towards.  Leave this 10yo bottle for the uninitiated.  Moving on....

Cheers, my friends and apologies to the SDT group I sent this sample to.  I'll do better next time."

Tasted while watching (delayed) Manchester derby. Tasted after Teeling Single Malt. 

First, involuntary impression of the nose was pet food! Then seaweed or brine. The pet food could be whiskas pouches with tuna, or perhaps it could even be tuna in brine.

The taste is lightly sweet and a touch briny. Not a huge fan of this. It improved as the glass neared empty. So far just 3 stars or lower even."

3.75,"Leather, pencil shavings. Honey and hints of raisin. Pleasant on the nose, moderate finish. Not your grandfather’s Jura."
2.5,"My second travel retail Jura and this is also by now discontinued to give way for another 10yo of theirs. 

This one had a palpable nose of blossoms and orchard fruits, mainly autumn apple. The fumes were more gentle with this one. 

On the palate there was a quick but full feel of hazelnut and then oak which is then joined by plenty of cereal notes and malted barley.

Finish continued with some more cereal notes and dark chocolate, rounded off with a hint of tannins, that orchard apple and salt. Rather light spirit and the notes are also light.

3.25,"Au nez : doux et boisé, noisette, amandes, céréales, vanille, poire, chocolat et une touche terreuse et florale
Au palais : léger, sec et boisé, noisette, amandes, céréales, légère herbe/pelouse et très légère note fumée 
La finale est mentholée avec une note de noisette

Note personnelle : 83/100

Un nez presque sherry et des saveurs portées sur la noisette et l’amande. Ce whisky ressemble à un jeune highland/speyside mais manque cependant un peu de caractère, Nice entry for a beginner though"

3.75,"Just a little bit pricier for what you get. It’s a good dram, it’s Jura after all, but for an everyday whiskey it could’ve been somewhat cheaper, like 20% less than it’s current price. But I did like it because of its softness. A drop of water wouldn’t kill it, too."

4.25,"Ok, it is confirmed, Jura IS THE BRAND. This is my second Jura after Superstition, and it is fantastic. 

On the nose it offers a lot of classic aromas, but i havent perceived this combination on any whisky before. 
You will find Plum and prunes at first, then Lemon and orange, some serious citrus notes there.

After the first taste your nose will open to perceive Nuts, Vanilla from tree (like smelling the tree itself) and Cocoa (i know it should be coffee since the official nosing says it, but for me, that is cocoa).

On the palate what dominates is an Amazing spicy flavor. Starts fruity and nutty, very pleasant. Body is kind of rare, not thick but not light either. Very Woody. Caramel is also present.

Finish is long an full of almonds and hard mint (like the ones you get from a restaurant to fix your breath after a meal).  Beautiful beautiful whisky. My second Jura, second success with this brand. As soon as i get to a foreign liquor store, im grabbing more of these beauties."
