Macallan Folio #2 is the second part of a 24 series of special Macallan Whiskies that conmemorate one of the most successful publicity campaigns of this distillery. I had the chance to taste it in the bar inside of the distillery, just a few meters far from the copper pot stills. Fancy bar, fancy whisky. 

Actually, it was amazing. Later i search for it and guess what? Its super expensive. Goes from 900 to 3000 depending on the store.

Ok, lets rate it!

Bottled at 43%abv, chesnut color. Beautiful vintage-like bottle (it was actually released on 2017, only 2000 bottles were ever made. 

On the nose: Almonds, Maraschino cherries, Tobacco, Strawberry marmalade,
Red fruits, Orange syrup, Brown sugar, Old caramel. Takes some time to develop, let it breath. Some lemon notes also appear after first sip. Wonderfully complex, this is what a fancy dram should offer. 

On the palate, Red fruits, Orange peel. Very smooth even if it feels a little watery, but mostly cherry maraschino syrup but watered down. Really great. 

Aftertaste is outstanding. Finish is lovely, comes out of nowhere. Its like burning hay.
Smoky, Tobacco, Brown grass finish. Very pleasant. The mouthfeel is just something else. 

This is a wonderful dram, and maybe i don't give it the perfect score just because of the price and my own prejudices, but it is really, really good. 97 over 100, i would recommend it but it is a little absurd because of the difficulty to find it. Sláinte!"
