2.25,"Wtf i just drank?

Nobushi is a blended japanese whisky with a nice looking bottle of a NOBUSHI which seems to be some kind of selected peasant warriors from the land of the rising sun. This is a blend from the Hokkaido, Nagano and Miyagi district. 

The result is.... nothing. Lets start.

Bottled at 40%abv, burnished gold color.

On the nose: odd from the very first moment you open the bottle. There is this cheap lemon / air freshener for cars aroma. Rice, fermented fruits and a cheap dried fruit aroma. Grain whisky. AND THIS WAS THE BEST PART.

Then, the palate. It is water With a touch of vainilla and a very dim grape note. 

Aftertaste is awful. Corn and acetone. Feels very young and grainy. This is the remain of some grain whisky distillation.

Overall, this is something you must avoid unless you are going to trick some non-drinkers into believing this dram is some kind of ""an acquired taste"" and you are some kind of a Connoisseur, hahaha. 45 out of 100 and it really should have a lower score. Kanpai!"
