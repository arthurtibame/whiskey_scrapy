3.75,Very smooth with minimal burn.  Stuffy nose though so don’t get the full flavor.

4.0,"""Very surprising, as it is much more complex than I expected. You certainly notice the rye, but beyond that there is a wonderful combo of different flavors. Not hot, but there is multiple spice notes while also having a sweet edge. Was he the ‘king of the bootleggers’? I don’t know, but this MGP product is very pleasant to sip and enjoy all night long.

2.0,"This came highly recommended by a local slinger of spirits.  I think this would be great in a cocktail, but as it was recommended as an excellent sipper, I was disappointed. It's not bad by any means, but I found it to be sickeningly sweet. Likely just a matter of personal taste, but with such high rye content, I hoped for a spicier, drier dram.  If you like your whiskey sweet and simple, this is your jam."

3.5,Clean and clear taste. A bit bright on the pallet. In a few years this should be quite good

3.0,"It's officially the holiday season and for me that means a whole lot more drams to help deal with the extra traffic and flock of snowbirds to the great state of AZ. A new gastropub opened close to the office so figured I'd check it out. This was a Bourbon I had been interested in as it's MGPs first forray into releasing their own stock with a brand they own. I like a lot of the Bourbons and Ryes that they are the source of (High West, Smooth Ambler immediately come to mind) so am interested to see how they do on their own. On to the tasting:
The first thing that hits me is that for a high rye Bourbon the entry is very sweet. Brown sugar, honey and cherries. Nothing too rich which tells me this is younger stock. From there you get a bit of a spice swell but it stays in check for a medium finish with rye and a hint of oak. 
For the price of the pour this is a slightly above average Bourbon. I like it. Don't love it. For the $40 bottle price I'd probably pass as there are much better values. However, if you like your Bourbons on the sweeter side, you should give this one a try. It's also super easy to drink. Cheers all"
4.75,"Look: Amber colored, slight lacing, and quite pretty alcohol legs

Nose: cinnamon, clove, tobacco, some sweet brown sugar, vanilla, wood. This bourbon smells like bourbon, but more so. Really potent, in a good way. 

Taste: More woody astringent characters than the nose would give you, followed by the sweet baked goods, and a heavy dose of pepper and cinnamon to end it as well as red apple and slight banana notes.   

Finish:  the finish is quite hot and spicy, with a lingering heat on my tongue, and flavor that lasts a few minutes. Sometimes, I get a higher bitterness in the finish, and I’m glad this bourbon is not like that. 

Overall: this bourbon is excellent, a complete surprise to me as I’d never heard of this spirit, and I got it from a coworker.  All the flavors are there for a good bourbon, with not many of those bitter notes in the finish."

3.25,"Smooth but not real exciting.  Flavors of oak, vanilla and white pepper.   The flavor stays consistent throughout."
3.75,"This is better than I expected.  I get the faintest scent of pine on the nose which also comes on the palate. I little mint, pine, and subtle sweetness. Christmas in a bottle. Nice moderate length finish."

2.75,This is ok. I do not get much on the nose. Taste profile is typical bourbon with vanilla and caramel but I also get a little pine on the palate. It is smooth with a short finish.  I would recommend getting at a bar before buying.

3.5,Neat.  Light bodied and a little bitter on the tongue.  Dark notes like chocolate.
3.75,The nose is light and clean with hints of the high Rye in the mash bill. Sweet upfront turns into a pleasant spicy finish.  Better than I expected.

3.75,"Nose is light- with some candied caramel and very light perfume.  Palette is enjoyable.  The heat is present, and with a drop of d/w the grain stands out, and there is a bit of a sweet note on the finish."

4.25,"Spicy and sweet smell. Initial taste is sweet honey and corn, and then a lot of rye spice. But the great oily body of this keeps the spices from burning and highlight a mix of flavors. Finish is fantastic with a medium mint and menthol finish that I love. For the price a fantastic value! Adding to the rotation."

2.75,"Honestly, this isn't a great bourbon. It's not sophisticated nor a complex , but it is a fun sweet whiskey.  I don't mean like those gimmicky apple or salted caramel though. 

The reviews I've read nailed it in their description. Fruit salad is the predominate flavor.  This is not one that you share with someone to impress with a rarity or meticulously crafted bourbon, this is one that you share with someone and tell them, ""You'll never believe  what I found for $35."" 

If you are entertaining or going to a sampling party, or better yet introducing someone to bourbon and/or whiskey - this is a great choice."
