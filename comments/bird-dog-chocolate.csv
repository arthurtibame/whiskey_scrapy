1.0,"Truly awful. My wife gave me a gift pack at Christmas with a 750ml bottle of their regular bourbon along with several mini bottles of various other flavored whiskies. Everything else was at least at least drinkable, if not particularly memorable. 

I don't ""get"" the trend of flavoring bourbons. Leave that crap to the cheap vodkas. This one tasted like chocolate syrup and cough syrup. 

Luckily, I had a bottle of Weller on hand so I could attempt to wash the taste out. It hasn't worked so far."
