3.0,"On the nose lots of vanilla and citrus fruits. Tasting there is some spice and oak that is apparent which lasts long. Good dram, reminds me a bit of the Glenlivet, but a much more complex nose"
2.0,"Very sweet aroma, slight vanilla and fruit. Very light on the palate. Other than the sweetness it totally bypasses my palate."

4.0,"Nose: sherry, walnut bread
Palate: soft arrival of dark fruits followed by cinnamon; long mild pepper finish. A few drops of water dampened the pepper but otherwise did not seem to change the taste. An Interesting and enjoyable sherried malt. No sulfur. Good buy if less than $80 USD"

Tasted this on holidays on a balmy evening in Tenerife. I found it initially to be very sweet and sherried. Probably a 3.5 stars on this outing."

4.0,"[LOOK] Light amber [NOSE] Fruit, floral notes, berry crumble, hints of cracked toffee, slight spice [PALETTE] Light homemade toffee, soaked strawberries, gentle tannins, faint mulling spices, barely browned butter [FINISH] Medium length, spice and perfume, pleasant, sweet [MOUTHFEEL] Rather bright and well balanced, straightforward palette with a complex and understated nose"
4.0,"Nose: Pungently malty and aromatically oaky. Fine old leather bookbinding, oatmeal cookies fresh from the oven, orange oil, toffee and nuts. As it opens the nose becomes richer but also spicier, so it all stays very well balanced. With water some light honey and floral tones appear.

Palate: A sweet cereal/malt arrival with some peppery spices and dark chocolate. Becoming even maltier in the development with raisins, dates, figs, treacle and a little vanilla appearing. The texture is oily, hearty and mouth-coating with lots of subtle oaky spice notes.

Finish: Medium/long. Warming and sweetly cereal, subtle and chewy.

A classic dry Speyside sherry nose - not an obvious big fruity sherry-bomb, but one where the tannins speak loud so the sherry asserts an oaky influence but does not impede the core malty cereal character. Mmm - I love this sort of profile. The palate is rich and dry at heart but with an enfolding cloak of semi-sweet, leathery sherry. A dash of water (not too much!) softens the palate wonderfully, adding just a touch of sweetness to balance the inherently dry character, however it does not change the profile much at all - the only downside is a hint of bitterness that creeps into the late palate.

What a nice dram - really good, in fact. It's a characterful, textbook old-school malt and although the distillery is in the northern Speyside area this whisky reminds me of some iconic west-coast whiskies (Ben Nevis, Oban - even Hazelburn).

Like others in the Distillery Labels series this is one of Gordon & MacPhail's contract bottlings. It is released frequently and is quite consistent in character. Highly recommended - I tasted this from a 30ml sampler and have just ordered a bottle.

NOTE: The old green container version has been phased out but despite rumours this whisky has not been discontinued - just repackaged.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

3.5,Excellent balance of sweet and smoky
4.0,"Found on my clearance hunt. Palette is fruity, tart, and a bit peppery, then leading to brown sugar and a tiny bit of peat.  Finish is medium length and the pepper seems to linger on the tongue,  but it doesn't really coat the mouth.  Pretty good stuff overall."

4.5,"My second gordon & macphail dram, a linkwood 15yo, better than what i expected, and after having two Gordon &MacPhail drams, i start to think this is a great independent bottler. 

On the nose:
Ginger
Cinammon
Spicy on the nose
Fresh forest
Lemon
Ultra spicy on the nose, the most spicy dram ever
Chocolate

On the palate: Very sweet at first, Chocolate toffee; then a oaky sensation, finally a spicy english sauce sensation. Wonderfully changing with every sip, full of layers.

Finish long ginger spice and pepper. delicious. very balanced.

A 91 over 100 is a solid score for this baby. Slainte!"

2.25,Light and sweet without much of a burn. There’s a slight grain note I’m picking up...
2.5,"Smells of apples and sherry. 

No peat. Very floral with lots of sherry flavor."
3.5,"If this was $70 or less, I wouldn't complain much, but for $100, the quality just isn't there, IMHO. Don't get me wrong, it is good, but I know I can do a bit better for $100. A lighter style, almost a desert malt except that it's not that sweet. The semi-sweet, spicy sherry notes are balanced with savory masculine old leather and woodspice notes. Buttery spicey caramel, graham crackers, honey, minerals, cardamom, and mild ginger. There's a creaminess to it that adds to the complexity. It is well balanced. No signature strawberry notes, really, until 2 months after being opened. Some dried fruits are present, and the sherry influence is imparted without being winey, which is a plus. Syrupy mouth-feel, despite the thin, broken legs. If this was $70 or less I'd give it a 4.25, and would replace it from time to time, but for $100 I can do much better.

I adjusted my review and score after Even More breathing time... waiting this long to fully enjoy it was annoying to say the least. High price prevented a higher score, which is unfortunate, because I do like it and that natural strawberry note is pretty unique."
