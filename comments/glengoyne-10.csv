3.0,"With a teaspoon of water, I get honey and heather on the nose.  Arrives with green apples and rich barley.  A slight taste of cardboard in the middle, but mostly pleasant vegetal barley.  A nice heat with cola and maybe a little licorice in the finish. A 3 star at this point, but may change. Will soon contrast with the 15 yo."

3.0,"This is a 3 1/2 for me. I love the heat on swallow,  and the rich taste. I get the honeysuckle real strong on initial pull. But there is a taste in just can't place mixed in. I don't like this flavor but the liquors flavor squashes it before I can figure it out or not enjoy the drink. Is it orange oil? Not sure, hope the 12 and 15 are as good if not better. Don't pass it. But if you can place the distinctive flavor please let me know."

4.0,"C&B 9/16. $43. Orange, creamy, sunny, biscuit, like an Irish whisky. Very nice but not sure I need to own it."
4.0,"The nose is sweet and round, specifically with scents of raisins, hint of caramel, and a very light touch of peat. 

Palate is very mild and round, particularly for a 10 year old. Hints of plums or raisins, tiny hint of banana perhaps. Some peat hidden in the flavors balance it all into a rather nice blend. The immediate taste is kind of sharp, but it quickly rounds out to a rather smooth experience. 

All in all a dram that is rather easy on the tongue. Light and smooth. Not an ""exciting"" whisky, but definitely not boring either. Simple and enjoyable."

3.0,"Picked this up a week ago continuing my search for inexpensive anytime drams. Tons of honey on the nose, pleasant but not much complexity detected beyond that.

Very sweet on the palate. The classic flavors of Vanilla, toffee and green fruit are there but very muted, nothing stands out.

On the plus side it has a thick creamy mouthfeel but it's not a very balanced whisky. Interchangeable with all the other ""Glens"", Livet, Fiddich and Morangie. An adequate option in the price range."

3.0,"Nose: Apples, the green ones. Milk chocolate, vanilla waffles, KitKat, or Coffee crisp. The nose is fresh and subtil, a tad shy. Hints of citrus. Dried orange peel?

Palate: It eludes me. It's rich and has honey caramel undertones but it's faint and quick.

Finish: Long, a small sting on the tip of the tongue, a little spicy, tart and salty. My dumpling sauce rings in there: combined soy sauce, rice vinegar and sambal oelek.

Final Thoughts: light and smooth and easy too drink, nothing too expansive or too fancy. 79/100"

It’s not amazing, but it is very good. For the price, you can do much worse. It’s worth trying if you’re an Apple fan. No bite to this at all."

3.0,"After hearing really good things about the Glengoyne distillery I noticed a 3 malt, age statement sample pack at one of the online stores I regularly make purchases from.  This pack was only $17 and included 2oz pours of the 10, 15 and 18 year old.  I figured now was as good of a time as any to give them a go.

Let’s start with the 10.  This particular sample was listed as the 40% ABV and not the standard 43%.  Hmm, I wonder why.  They advertise no added coloring, but I’m sure it is chill filtered.  It’s shiny gold and will leave thick, runny legs and big drops behind in your tasting glass of choice.

The nose is honey and fresh cut lumber right from the sawmill.  There’s cereal notes, light florals and butterscotch.  All things you’ve come to expect from a Lowland distillery’s standard whisky.  Extra time in the glass doesn’t hurt nor help this one- so get to sipping.

The palate brings the butterscotch, toffee, faint sherry sweetness and cereal notes to your tastebuds, but does leave some light, black pepper spice and a hint of oak and barley lingering into the finish.  It’s exceptionally smooth for a 10 year old, no doubt.

The finish is pretty short, while remaining smooth and light.  There’s more oak left behind than sweetness and it eventually turns peppery and dry.

While it’s nothing earth shattering, it is very good for a baseline, 10 year old single malt.  I could see it adding some bite to any light cocktail you make out of it and there’s no reason why you can’t pour it over ice and make a chilled sipper out of it.  This pour cost me $6 and that’s about all I’d be willing to spend on it.  Hopefully, the 15 & 18 will add some depth and complexity when I get around to sampling those.  3 stars and no worries.  Cheers, my friends."

Lingering floral sweetness and a touch of overused cask bitterness. From a 50ml sample with a questionable cap, so can’t be too harsh, but this is striking average malt whisky. I’ve heard the 12 is great, and the one other Glengoyne I had was great, so I am keeping an open mind."

The nose is a bit faint but slightly sweet, while the palate reveals a slightly herbal, but fuller and creamier taste, that ends in a similar finish.

Not a bad dram, but I won't buy a full-size bottle."

I do think it is slightly over-priced, but I still buy it because it is sometimes what I am in the mood for."
