5.0,I really love this bourbon. I have tasted the 2015-01 and love them both. Damn close to my favorite out of the Beam line up. Super rich and a wonderful warming finish.

4.0,"Believe it or not.... Just found a bottle of 15-02 at an old liquor store (July 2018) and at regular price. It was pushed to the back of the shelf.

And... it’s a delicious Booker’s batch. Glad I came across it."

4.0,"Not an American Whiskey lover at all but this was a present to a good friend and we toasted it!  It packs a punch!! I would say it's a must if you like your Bourbon, it's as raw and ready as they come!"
4.0,"Drinking neat: Lots of spicy cedar, musky oak, burnt caramel, buttered cinnamon toast, creamed corn, oily and decadent, easy drinking for it's proof, very spicy like a rye. Dangerously drinkable but I'm not so sure it tastes/smells much better than a Woodford Reserve or a Old Grand Dad BiB."

4.0,"Still sitting in my collection.  After 3 years and 1/2 bottle gone, this expression still carries heavy alcohol on the nose, with leather and oak.  Wonderful golden brown hue. Flavor profile is still overpowered with alcohol, but there is a caramel flavor, slight hazelnut, al atop a lasting oak and lasting burn."
4.0,Muuy sabroso. Astringente en boca como el orujo blanco. Una pena no haberlo probado añadiendo agua.
