4.0,"Fig makes an appearance early on. The body adds a spice element to the usual Glenfiddich fruit profile. It felt a bit dry on the finish, not a bad length. A bit overpriced."

4.0,This definitely gets a 4 - early 4's I'd say and is now my new favorite Glenfiddich overtaking the red wine one. Its one of the few times a low abv actually works turning this into an almost full bodied  dessert whiskey liqueur without excessive sweetness. Now at $120USD a bottle I wouldn't be buying a whole one but if you want a good example of the  style or perhaps rather to say an example of a strong Maderia influence this is it. As others have noted not a long complex finish or really even a complex anything but the rest of the experience means that this isn't really a major detraction

4.0,The nose had promise which then translated to a superb entry strangely light yet spicy and fruity. The finish is probably its weakest point but overall a great bottle. I also picked this up for about 142 in Klia vs 175 at Syd airport.
3.0,"Great opener, not a great finisher. The nose is actually much better than the palate, with burnt sugar, oak and chocolate greeting your nose. The palate is painfully spicy (think cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and satan) which I struggled to appreciate. The finish, in opposition to the palate, is quite smooth, though it's overall 40% ABV created an impression that is weak and fleeting."

5.0,Very smooth. Notes of honey. Darker complexion.
3.0,"There’s nothing that says class than sipping a single malt in your hotel room out of cheap plastic clear cups, sitting in your gym shorts and a wife beater shirt.  I feel that a Glenfiddich is the wrong drink for this picture.  Instead maybe moonshine?  Anyway, here on a business trip in Orlando, and I managed to smuggle my Glenfiddich sample in the carry-on.  Nose is lacking, but promising.  Oak, spicy, a bit hot.  Taste is much better.  Ginger, bread dough, more spice like nutmeg and cinnamon.  Quick finish.  It’s good...but really nothing to write home about.  Decent.  One can do better at the price range.  The bourbon cask in this range was much better.  Then again, just an opinion of some guy sitting here in gym shorts and a wife beater, what do I know?"

4.5,"Simply outstanding. Marvelous. 

This Glenfiddich 19yo Age of Discovery Madeira cask, is very fancy.

Bottled at 40%abv, with a beautiful mahogany color.

I loved everything about it, but specially the palate. 

On the nose you will find Liquorice, brown sugar, cremè brulee, some salt, sweet bread, caramel and gummy bears. The problem is that i had it on a tumbler glass and not in a glencairn so i can't really tell you if it has a dim aroma or not. It seems you have to work hard to get your nosing right on this beauty.

On the palate, it is very smooth and sugary with a gentle hotness, very Fancy indeed.

Main notes:
Refined liquorice Very pleasant,
Brown sugar and creme brulee, Oaky but sweet at the same time.

Finish is full of an ashy spicyness and a touch of slight peatyness. Wonderful.

Overall this is a 93/100, a great, great dram."
4.75,"D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S.

A strong dram with a long lasting taste. One to pour and have a drink for more than 1.5 hours. Definitely one to buy again."
