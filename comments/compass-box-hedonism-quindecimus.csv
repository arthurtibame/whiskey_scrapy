null,"How can you say, ""This is a very good whisky, even more elaborate and complex than the standard Hedonism bottlng. "" and rate it 88, while the standard bottling is ranked 97 on distiller...doesn't seem like an accurate rating"
null,This is my favorite by Compass Box. Loads of coconut vanilla with a hint of lemon frosting. Just delicious. Not sure why it’s rated lower than the regular Hedonism which is very good also.

5.0,"The nose is full of pink wafer biscuits – vanilla, cream, a tiny bit of something more medicinal, like rising bread dough.

In the mouth, I'm finding it hard to believe that this is 46% – not that 46 is particularly fiery, but this juice is so smooth it's like drinking honey syrup. A bit of spice, but the texture mellows it out. There's sweetness there for sure though, reminds me of the time I tipped a glass of 20yr tawny over a sticky toffee pudding. The alcohol cutting through the caramel.

It's got an amazing finish. For something so smooth it hangs around for ages: the pepper and maybe some cloves tickling the back of your nostrils for what feels like forever. Worth savouring every mouthful."
