3.75,Really sessionable. Great for an evening of drinking but lacks depth and has super short finish
3.75,The nose could be a bitt sweeter and juicier. Lovely dram nevertheless.
4.0,"Great and surprising whiskey.  On the nose is very pleasant. It is easy recognizable as a Jack Daniels for its aroma. 

On the nose: beautiful smoke from the charcoal. Grapes and plum. Wood is present. 

On the palate you get this wood oakiness flavor, that starts very smooth sweet and Gentle, to change into a hot flavor, long lasting and delicious. Caramel is everywhere.

I usually dont spect much from american Whiskeys but this one is very good."

4.0,"All-around solid taste,finish,smell especially for price"
3.25,"Nose - honey, oak, brown sugar, light nuttiness, hints of rye spice
Taste - oak spice and almonds, honey and brown sugar
Finish - dry oak tannins and a bit of spice"
3.0,It’s one step above your ordinary Jack Daniels.  Pretty much a good introduction to a slightly better quality.  Not really worth the money when Eagle Rare cost nearly the same.  I probably won’t buy it again but I’ll drink it again if that’s all there is🤷‍♂️
4.5,"I love me some Gentleman Jack. It's one of my favorite Whiskey's to drink neat or on the rocks. I believe that the smoothness rivals bottles into the $50-$100 range. I think that it's smoother than the competitively priced Evan Williams Single barrel. If you like to mix this goes great with an old fashion or even a Mexican Coke. The smoothness comes from being charcoal-mellowed twice, but is still full flavored body. This is a good whiskey for the newer Whiskey Enthusiast, looking to crack into the middle to top shelf. This will always sit with my top shelf, due to the smoothness."

4.0,"This is the whiskey my rich uncle was given for Christmas one year. It's got a ""could drink every day"" taste, and is definitely a step up from Old No. 7. Kind of the difference between how you would show up to class in college vs. how you would go to a career fair. May not be on my shelf all the time, but I wish it would be."

2.25,"Gentleman Jack

NOSE: Artificial Banana, Juicy Fruit Gum, Vanilla, Maple. Pretty simple and straightforward, but ruined by a big wallop of ethanol that doesn't go away even with time in the glass.
NEAT: Thin, General Maple Sweetness, lots of Peanut Shell, and Green Banana. There is a surprising burst of Heat (for an 80pf) on the finish. There is a Sour, Bitter, Drying Coating that remains on the palate and ruins the experience. Continuing the banana theme, it's like when you accidentally get some of the inner pith of the banana peel. It develops into a ""Plastic-y"", synthetic aftertaste.
SPLASH: The bitterness actually gets worse.

VERDICT: I had this several years ago and remember thinking it was better than Old No. 7, but nothing special. On a whim I picked up a bottle at the ABC recently. I had absolutely zero recollection of the offending sour/bitter note. I thought maybe my palate was off, so I gave it several days and multiple pours. It maybe lessened, or I maybe became accustomed to it? But it never went away. There is so much wrong here. The ethanol on the nose. The sour clingy finish. The synthetic ""plastic-y"" note. The only thing that saved this from the 1's, is I actually kind of liked it with a large cube of ice. Once this bottle is gone, there will never be another. In the running for ""worst mass-produced whiskey I've ever had""."
3.0,"This is one I buy often, but not always. A pint usually. Maybe a 750 if it comes with some barware I like. I not-so-secretly detest the profile of regular no.7 so I dont really ever miss not having Gentleman around.

Gentleman is 'double mellowed' allowing you to get double fu--I mean enjoy the distinct sweetness of this particular whiskey twice as easily. It gets the Tennessee Maple charcoal process twice instead of once like standard Daniel's expressions.

Nose
MAPLE charcoal. Caramel, the extra sugary kind you dip or coat apples with. You can practically touch the 'banana' palate note with just your nose. Extremely sweet charred oak. SMALL hint of vanilla, faintest hint of raw turbinado sugar freshly toasted. It disappears quickly and is small, but I get a grassy/lemongrass thing all the way at the end. A big pile of candy but it's not as saccharine/artificial as I remember it sometimes being in the past.

Palate
Maple, banana milkshake, unsalted/unbuttered grits, honey. Somewhere right before it glides down your throat effortlessly theres the QUIETEST little peck of spice from stewed apples intermingled with peppery oak tannin.
The double mellowing is showcased in the swallow but you would be wise to pay attention to how the liquid itself is still generously flavorful for being extra-filtered and straightforward/one-dimensional.

Mouth
DANGER, DANGER.  It goes down without trying. It's so sweet and balanced the ridiculous oily oil-overload somehow works. I personally think the oil mouth is what makes regular no. 7 undrinkable so that says a lot. It is easily 10/10 outstanding in this specific aspect despite being relatively 'bleh' in other sections.

IMO Jack seems to have been improving this one over the nearly 20 years I've been consuming it. The only real criticism here is how just truly devoid of anything besides easy drinkability it is--something that truthfully feels like another compliment. 

Drink it neat, rocks, lemonade, straight from a pint, etc. Its good."

4.5,"Nose: definitely getting the standard JD banana nose, but with a custard flavor to it.

Palate: more standard JD banana bomb. Instead of baked banana bread this is more like a banana cream pie flavor. Plenty of vanilla as well.

Finish: great clean linger of the palate flavors. 

Very easy sipper with almost no alcohol burn"

3.5,"Definitely, a mellowed version of the original JD’s, smooth and very sippable but, I wish it had more character though."
