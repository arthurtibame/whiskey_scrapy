2.0,"I picked this up on a whim because I'm from MD, the bottling is nice, and it's affordable.  Right off the bat it tastes very scotch-like and I noticed a black licorice note when I tried it again later.  I’m not a fan of scotch (or black licorice) because any peat note is off-putting to me, so this is a challenging one to rate.  With that said, I've got to go 2 here.  It's not for me, but it's got a good texture so maybe others will find it more palatable."

3.0,"Straightforward and sweet but a bit sharp. Better for mixing than sipping. Probably won’t be buying again at the $40 price, but I don’t regret trying a local product."
