3.75,"The barrel proof offerings from TC Whiskey are significantly better than their standards. Hoping the Rye follows suit. Nose is light on burn with a hint of sweetness to the classic Rye notes. First sip packs a punch at nearly 120 proof, but not in an alcohol forward burn. There is some Rye sweetness in there with some cardamom edges. The finish is the star though with a lengthy smooth habanero burn. Overall not quite as nice as the BP Whiskey. At $80 I will probably not buy another when this runs dry."
