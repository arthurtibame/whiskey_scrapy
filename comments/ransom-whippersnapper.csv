3.0,I echo previous statements of it smelling like Reposado... I don't love that. Didn't love drinking this on ice.  I'll try it in my flask and in cocktails this weekend and see if my opinion changes but as of right now this is a one off probably won't buy again.

4.0,"Aromas reminiscent of a Reposado (or younger) tequila, with hints of Scotch whisky as sweet peated notes sneak in. Very creamy on the mouth feel. Almost no warmth until about the middle of the chest, and quite subtle even then. Gentle woody notes appear beneath the creamy feel which I account to my mistaken reception of the malted barley. Perhaps, better pegged as a bit of a toasted marshmallow essence. Overall, an odd evolution of flavors as the palette gets more accustomed to this very interesting Maverick Whiskey. A tad sweet and seemingly flat in flavor to be my daily go-to, but a very respectable whiskey that is well worth experiencing for the unique nuance of aromas and flavors."

5.0,"Reminiscent of tequila or a white dog whiskey on the nose. The palate on this is truly bizarre (in a good way). It was a real treat not to be greeted by the typical triad of American whiskey flavors with this puppy. The first thing that came to mind with this whiskey was super-ripe mulberries. The barley/corn combination here tastes like nothing I've yet tried. The flavors pull in several directions, like two evenly-matched players of tug-of-war. With every sip more complexity unfolds with this whiskey. If this is the oddball direction in which American whiskey is slowly chugging, chug on."

1.5,Very alcohol tasting. Lacking in smooth notes. Basically vodka soaked in a barrel.

4.0,Sweet and smooth. Drinks way above its price point
3.75,Interesting whiskey. Fruity and herby to the nose with a bit of caramel. Taste is warm and easy with hints of fruit and toffee. Silky finish.

3.5,Baking spices and tropical fruit on the nose. Wow the palate is quite nice. The mouthfeel is thicker and the palate tastes like baked dessert. I’m not good enough to pick flavor notes out but it’s super unique palate.
4.0,Not sweet but thick Carmel flavor with a bit of alcohol nose

2.0,Honestly this has been on my shelf for a good 3 years and it’s because I can’t get myself to drink it. Just an odd flavor almost like it’s still just ground up grains that never got a chance to mash and mellow into the good flavors whiskey has. Just not for me to drink by itself. Might make a good cocktail.
