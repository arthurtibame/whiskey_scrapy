4.25,"Fancy. (please read this review with an England English accent). This Special Royal Salute blend is allegedly selected from only 88 cask with exceptional taste. It is so fancy that made me feel in a rich, powerful party, like it was intended for a president and his guests. Now to the analysis: Since it is so fancy and a blend scotch whisky it is very gentle, very easy to drink, very smooth, made for everyone. i dont think there is someone who will dislike this whisky, but for people who rate whiskies it will be too linear and too simple. On the nose there is this peat, stinky but beautiful peatyness and caramel. Its like the normal Royal Salute but its peatyness is not the perfumed one, it is the stinky one. Not much else but it doesn't need to. Bottled at 40% abv. dark amber color. On the palate is so beautiful and elegant. You should wear a frac to drink it. absolutely delicious, very sweet, with toffee, caramel, ginger, and a light wood flavor, new wood, as furniture. It has no body. it is so light bodied that is like water. very mellowed. it has almost no finish which is the worst part of it. When drinking this i felt it was made for fancy people who don't know much about whisky, for them to tell in parties phrases like (read in fancy english accent) ""Oh my god lord, this is such a fine and pleasant beverage"". But a Connoisseur will say it is delicious but plain. In other words if you are a normal mortal man you will love it. If you are like me, a stupid self proclaimed Connoisseur you will find it good but not the end of the world. Slainte! 89 over 100"
