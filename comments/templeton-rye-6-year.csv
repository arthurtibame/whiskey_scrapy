5.0,It’s good but similar to the 4 year and I can’t tell a major difference. Go Hawkeyes. Slightly biased.

4.0,"4.0/5.0. Hard to tell much if any difference from the old NAS or current 4-yr, enough to knock it down a star (4 vs 5) for the extra price without much extra to show for it.  Still very good rye with prominent red hot cinnamon spice and a hint of gentian bitters and a gently pleasant licorice.  Classic minty-herbal rye notes."
4.0,"This is fantastic. Nose is sweet pineapple and coconut. Taste begins with sweet fruit and then vanilla, spice, banana and a little heat in the finish."
4.0,"Nose: Cream soda, flowers, vanilla, mascarpone, sweet cream. 

Taste: Sweet, floral, light pepper, clove. 

Templeton has its own unique flavor. Their ""secret recipe"" they add to mgp rye. Its great, however it does make you wonder what it is and if you are enjoying the whiskey or some type of flavoring..."

4.0,"I like the Templeton 4 for Manhattans and the 6 is even better. It really works as a mixer for some reason. On sale for $41 ($10 off here), so almost the same price as the 4, so why not? Would not buy at $52."

4.0,"I get the cinnamon and vanilla notes. I like my whiskey better with a single cube of ice, abs this is no exception. This would make an awesome cocktail."
4.0,"blind tastes against 4 year. smell: fruitier, sweeter, faint. taste: definitely herbal. smoky?-meh, nah not smokey. fuller and richer? not super sweet. not tart. floral. closer to fruity. less punchy. smells “old-time.” delicate? DO NOT ADD WATER. overall: fruits floral herbal, interesting, old grandma delicate."
2.75,Probably a really good rye whiskey. This is my first. I’m spoiled by scotch. I’m sure it’s great for what it is. I’d just rather have scotch.

3.0,"Has a nice typical rye flavor, a touch of sweetness, but a bit of spice too. Enjoyable, but not enough different from the 4 year to pay the difference"

3.5,"I could always do with a higher percentage of rye, but this is still a very smooth, delicious rye."
4.25,"this stuff stands out.  it's an outlier, sure, but it's unique. looking for something new and different,  try this stuff."
2.0,"cloyingly sweet, vanilla with a little bit of cinnamon on the nose.  the taste is more vanilla with a spicy finish.  not very complex or interesting in the nose or palate"

4.5,Tropical notes smash with traditional rye spiciness in a whiskey that is surprisingly whimsical and almost refreashing as a rye. Love it.
4.0,A little milder than rittenhouse. Solid though

4.0,At this price point one of the better eyes out there. Bought on a whim and pleasantly surprised. Great introductory Rye.
4.0,"Nose is sweet, with notes of toffee. First sip is sweet and fruit. Transitions to a mint and spice medium length finish. Loses the mint notes with the addition of water. Overall, this is an excellent neat sipping Rye, that also works very well in an Old Fashioned or Manhattan."
4.0,Better on the rocks
4.0,"Nose: Licorice, Herbal, Honey, Apple, Vanilla, Fruity

3.5,"I will start by saying that i am not a big fan of the standard four year Templeton and I definitely did not like their shady marketing practices making people believe that they distilled their own whiskey. With that being said my dad had a bottle of 6 year so i didn't have to buy a bottle or a pour at a bar. 

This 6 year is a step up from the four year and is better than what i was expecting. With that being said it is not your typical spicy rye whiskey and it's more juicy than dry. It is an easy drink to sip on at a reasonable price if you are somewhat new to ryes. Don't expect an over the top complex sipper, enjoy it in a cocktail or on the rocks."
