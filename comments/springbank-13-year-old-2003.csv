4.0,"After just having that Speyside Beinn Dubh, this was a total about-face 180.  That Beinn Dubh was a strange curiosity.  This here is something normal;  maybe better than normal.  It’s like going from dating that weird girl who always wants to show you her knife collection to then dating a cheerleader.  ( yes true story,,,although truth be told the knife collector was much more crazy fun).  Ashy, sweet, lingering lemon custard finish.  Can’t really tell it’s sherry matured...the wood has clearly taken a back seat to the distillery character.  Well made Springbank again."
4.25,"There are times when I drink whiskey after whiskey that others often rate highly and think...meh, to bitter, to this to that...maybe its me...maybe my taste buds just aren't working and then there are days where my confidence is restored I'm like yeah my taste buds are just fine thank you and this is one of those days. 3 out of 3. Jose Familia, Tomatin 21 and now Springbank 2003 13. Bam, Bam, Bam...... this is easily a 4.25 maybe 4.5. It could have been higher but Tomatin 21 before it really made an impact so sadly it's just not quite at that level but still if I was Winnie the Pooh I'd be one happy bear. Honey galore, vanilla and more. Hint of bitterness and I think I sadly watered it down to much. Still great drop. I see several months after release its sold out as only 540 bottles were produced and already going for double the money in auction houses."
