2.0,I got interested by BOB. But it didnt live up to my expectations. Pretty flat whisky. Legs are weak and nose is nothing much.

1.5,"Whisky number 7 in my current batch of 12 blends.

Nose: Sherry, predominantly. Some hints of a light fruitiness and a distant briny note.

Palate: Rather flat and vacant on the whole. Some cereal notes - I'd say malt if I was being generous. Again a hint of brine and some restrained fruit.

Finish: Short, with a slight touch of tannic bitterness.

Relatively uninteresting and of best use as a mixer. Dilution brings out a light apple note and some further sweetness on the palate, but it's restrained. There's not anything actively unpleasant about it - there's just not a lot at all and it is not quite as good as Bell's Original or Cutty Sark.

The equal most generic whisky of the affordable blends so far, along with J&B Rare, but not afflicted with the sour notes that haunt Famous Grouse and Grant's Family Reserve.

""Adequate"" : 1.5 stars"
