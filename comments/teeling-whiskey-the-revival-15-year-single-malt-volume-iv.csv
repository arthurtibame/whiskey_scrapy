4.5,"My recent Teeling tasting jumped from the first Revival release to this fourth edition, which likewise leads with stone fruits on the nose. Each sip delivers tinned peaches in cream with a sprinkling of white pepper. The finish is likewise long on cream and fruit with more pepper. Delightful."
3.75,Another Irish another success. Teeling maybe pretty average to poor distillers but they definitely knew how to pick good casks from others. This one has apparently spent the whole time in rum. Honeyed grapefruit is the main flavor combo. I like it but I think the JJ Corry 16 year Flintlock beats it out.
