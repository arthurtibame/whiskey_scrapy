2.0,"This is not sipping whisky. But then, it's not supposed to be. It is all lemon, grapefruit, maybe a little pepper in the mouth and some herbs. If you sip this, you will be disappointed. However, if you are looking for those flavour notes in a cocktail, it will do very well. (Sipping 2 stars, Cocktail 4 stars)"
2.0,"A very strange whisky. Smooth, almost oily, yet watery thin at the same time. Very little flavour. Faint wheat, maybe a hint of caramel and very slight rye spice and that’s it. It’s not off putting. There’s just nothing there... $34 in Ontario."
1.0,First whisky ever I had to dump down the drain.
