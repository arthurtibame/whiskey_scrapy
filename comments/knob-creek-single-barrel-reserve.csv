Oily, sweet maple syrup with bold orange flavors. Dark chocolate. Viscous. Really wonderful and impressive stuff.  The start to finish spice from the proof will make you consider watering down, but do not hide these flavors.  An affordable ($42) treat."

5.0,"As most of you probably know, Jim Beam lets people do private selections of Knob Creek barrels. A group of bourbon lovers here in Houston periodically do barrel picks, which a few local liquor stores then sell. This month, they did a barrel of Knob Creek and a barrel of Knob Creek rye. I’m not much of a Knob Creek fan generally, but I heard great things about this barrel, so figured it was worth a try. This particular barrel is #6709, from Jim Beam’s Warehouse E, Floor 4, Rack 18, Tier 3, and was barreled on 3/5/08 and selected on 4/9/18.

Age: 9 years

Mashbill: Jim Beam Standard (75% corn; 13% rye; 12% barley)

Abv: 60%

Price: $42.99 at Rice Fine Wines and Liquor

Setting: Neat in a Glencairn, with two fat basset hounds next to me.

Nose: Heavy Nutter Butters, with some accompanying oak and brown sugar. Potent and delicious, this is one of the best noses I’ve ever sampled. (24/25 points)

Taste: Peanuts, peanut butter, oak, rye. Goes down surprisingly easily for how potent this stuff is, although it does pack some heat. Tastes pretty great. (47/50 points)

Finish: Everlasting. (23/25) points)

Conclusion: This is a fantastic whiskey – easily one of the best that I have ever had. I suspect this would have made a good Booker’s if it hadn’t been selected by the Bourbon Hounds. It has the traditional Jim Beam peanut funk, but dialed up to 11, and in an extra tasty fashion. It’s only real fault is that it is a little one-dimensional, but when the flavor is this good, I don’t view that as much of a fault. All that being said, you have to like peanuts, and if you don’t, this probably isn’t great. I’m a big fan of Nutter Butters, so I’m a little biased towards this flavor profile. I liked this so much, especially for the price, that I ended up going back the next day to grab another bottle, as well as a bottle of the rye. I’m pretty curious to try some Booker’s (which I’ve never had) and see how it compares.

3.0,"Total wine store pick, rested about 6 months. 120 proof

Nose: caramel, toffee, molasses, honey, slight alcohol burn. 
Added water: I can smell some vanilla now and a faint sweetness.

Palate: immediately hit by alcohol, very warming, and then notes of oak, tannin, and caramel.
Added water: all the same flavors more pronounced now but tasting more tannins and leather.

Finish: fades into more mellow sweetness mixed with cough syrup. 
Added water: finish is a lot more watery which kills that syrupy goodness, but has a doctor peppery taste now."

4.75,"Knob Creek single barrel store pick aged over 14 years for under $40!  

Enjoyed neat from a Glencairn.  This Beam expression offers a fairly simple nose and flavor profile, but those simple flavors are so rich, mature, and so well balanced.  Sometimes a bourbon doesn't need tons of complexity to be considered great, and that's how I'd describe this one.

On the nose is very rich maple, brown sugar, vanilla, pecan pie, and given the age, a surprising fresh toasted barrel wood scent.  After 14 years I'd almost expect a somewhat musty barrel forward wood scent, but not so.  The barrel is actually more of a secondary note behind the great sweet maple/vanilla combo.  Again a fairly simple nose but very rewarding in the notes it offers.

The palate instantly starts very hot served neat.  A very hot and spicy warming heat, and rightfully so at 60% ABV and I love it; it's lively high spice, wakes your senses up, starts a fire on the tongue, means business.   After the burn comes the rich flavors from the nose.  It offers a taste of exactly what you smell here. Very rich sweet maple, toasted brown sugar, vanilla, spices of cinnamon and clove, and beautifully toasted wood.  Also a nice minty menthol comes on late.  Again not overly complex, but very balanced, so delicious, and rich deep classic bourbon flavors.   Almost bourbon perfection!

The finish lingers a while and is very pleasing, offering more maple, honey, cinnamon, and a more aged wood flavor.  For a 14 year bourbon, I half expected an oak bomb, which I wouldn't have minded anyway.   But that's not the case.  Everything is in perfect harmony here, nothing trying to stand out among anything else.  

Overall for under $40 for a 14 year bourbon that's so well balanced and flavorful, this is hard to beat.  All the classic bourbon flavors are represented here, but amped up to 11 and that's why I love the KC SiB!  That combined with the 120 proof, and it's a heck of a deal for a quality pour.  I'm not typically the biggest Beam fan, normally favoring Buffalo Trace or Turkey products, but the KC has earned a spot in my top rotation for sure!  It's Kentucky Straight Delicious!  Cheers!"

Legs on the thicker side, really aromatic nose, I can't see any bourbon drinker being dissatisfied with this bottle. It's worthy of it's price point."

4.5,"On the nose is dark brown sugar, oak wood, cinnamon spice, vanilla, ginger, rye grain, barrel char, subtle smoke, dried orange peel, cracked leather and cherry lozenges.  The aroma feels very dense and heavy, like it doesn’t want to leave the glass.
-
To the palate it is incredibly hot with a powerful flavour kick at that 60% ABV!  Lots of oak, very astringent, drying on the palate with savory spices, cinnamon and black pepper before sticky brown sugar sweetness arrives with orange citrus oil and spicy ginger with a touch of rye spice.
-
The finish is long with dry oak, leather and tingling black pepper spice accompanied by a pleasant warmth and finally a whisp of smoky char on the exhale.
—
With water added the aromas open up revealing more sweetness.  More approachable on the palate, showing that signature root beer flavour I usually associate with Knob Creek.  Even more dry on the finish, more savory oak.

Bourbon Mark:  95

Foolishly, I bottle killed the standard Knob Creek after my review weeks ago, but I did compare them back then.  From memory, I find this one is more richly flavoured and intense.  I really like it!  I think this will replace standard Knob Creek for me."

3.75,"For today's Friday dram, I am going back to basics. Back to my style of choice. Well aged high proof Kentucky Bourbon. This particular Barrel is aged for 13 years (Barrel # 7373) and was selected by Fred Noe for Costco AZ. I was shocked at how old it was as I always assumed these single barrel were all 9 years old. However like most store picks, they do vary quite a bit and this is by far the oldest I have sampled from Knob Creek. On to the tasting! 
Right upon entry you are smacked with a big toffee and burnt brown sugar notes that moves quickly to a big cinnamon driven swell. It just about stays in balance for the long oak driven finish. You can literally taste the age. This one wasn't hot at all for the 120 proof. However, with how big the oak and spice swell was, I decided to drop a small ice cube to see how it impacted the flavor profile. As expected, they both recede to reveal butterscotch, Reeces Cups and pecan pie! Much better with ice. Nice complexity. 
I cannot believe I am saying this, but I think this is a little to well aged. 12 years probably would make this a 5 star bottle. As it its just shy of 4. It's the equivalent of a nice batch of Booker's. Cheers all!"

The main difference I perceive is that this has more wood characteristics than the flagship Knob Creek, probably owing to the 9 year age statement that the other no longer has. There is not a particular quality that I'd write home about, other than being a really robust, effectively barrel strength bourbon for a modest cost. Not in the same league as booker's but then there's  a $30 difference. This is a great guinea pig to test a high proof whisky if you've never had one before."

A very well made and complex bourbon.  While the alcohol heat is a little intense, it is still surprisingly smooth for 120 proof.  A little bit of water tames the heat and still maintains most of the complexity.  this particular bottle was barreled on 10/15/04 and bottled on 8/3/18."

Age: 14 years

Finish: spice and proof does come up here, but pleasant. Oak returns on the finish. Some zesty citrus too. 

Despite the age of 14 years, this store pick is well balanced, not too oaky, a bit spicy, but enough sweetness to spread things out. It consistently beats Bookers for me, but your mileage may vary."

At first I was a little turned off by the cherry cough syrup note but have grown to enjoy it as I haven’t had that prominent of a cherry note before. This is a barrel pick from Gresham Liquor Store  and I have not seen cherry mentioned much in reviews for the whiskey. Guessing I may have gotten a bottle from a special barrel :)"

Lingering spicy finish.  Maybe a touch too much spice interaction here, but not too hot and has a nice mouthfeel.  Like.  

Add a couple drops of water: evens out the spices, really brings the individual flavors to the fore.  Finish is till long and spicy, touch of heat lingers.  Nice.  9/4/19."

I’ve experienced big changes in palate when adding a little water but this is the first time I’ve seem dramatic changes in the nose as well. It’s like turning the key to a locked treasure chest. Now it was a well balanced mix of vanilla, oak, spice, maybe a hint of cherries and a whiff of saltiness much like an ocean breeze.

4.0,"The nose is fruit and oak.  On the palate I get quite a lot of spice, butter, and apple.  This is very hot without water, but not in a bad way.  It's hard to identify the heat.

With a splash of water, the nose opens up a bit showing caramel and spice, wood, and perhaps a light hint of vanilla.

The butter and spice is even more pronounced with a splash of water.  It's still hot, but the hotness is more cinnamon and pepper than ethanol.  The apple is still present but I get a bit of char and rye now."

4.5,"After all the amazing reviews and ratings I snagged a bottle. This is some serious cask strength bourbon! Poured neat, clingy glass coat. Nose isn't as strong as I would have expected. Ethanol is present but muted. Has maple, leather, dusty caramel, varnished hardwood and wet leaves. Some rye notes come in after resting including some pleasant dill. Palate is bold oak soaked with thick maple caramel, cashew butter, candy apple, vibrant heat(not harsh) and robust spice. Wonderful heavy damp musky note throughout. Deep and complex with great balance of sweet/spicy with plenty of barrel at 9 years. Long lasting finish of melting caramel and strong musky oak with spicy cinnamon. I find the delivery less of a bomb going off like some high proof whiskey. Its more like a locomotive, once it gets going it cant be stopped powering through to finish. This is the most scotch like bourbon Ive had with the exceptional range and nuance of flavor. I had high expectations for this and Im not disappointed. Well worth the $42 I paid............95/100....fantastic bourbon, buck twenty yet smoooth.....dropping in some H2O opens the nose and blossoms the flavors or stick to neat and enjoy the heat.......I agree with everyone else, anyone that enjoys bourbon needs to try this heavyweight"

Smell is sweet, deliciously sweet. First taste tells me standard knob Creek flavor profile. No complaints so far. Mouthfeel is a bit warm since it is 120 proof I’m not surprised but it’s not overwhelming either. Goes down well for the proof also. I really like what I’m tasting here. Outstanding bourbon for a non-allocated item and an age statement on the bottle too. I feel for the price point I’d certainly go back to this one again. 
As a tasting note I also added a small cube to open the flavor profile and bring the proof down and it worked wonders. I’m thoroughly impressed with this one. Thanks KC for putting out readily available bourbon that doesn’t taste like crap."

3.75,"OK so another Knob Single to review.  10/14/2004 to 2/5/2019 so 14+ years old.  Party Source pick.  

Nose - I get a light fruit, some saw dust, cherry wood, and alcohol esters.  You might notice some bourbon notes missing.  A drop of water and this things pops open and unlocks the classic bourbon notes.  There a funk and hay and barn like note here too.  A touch of savory. 

Taste - Butter, toast, vanilla, oak...oh and a really rich butter on the finish.  A second taste and I'm getting more of the classic bourbon vanilla and caramel and oak.  It's lively and explosive in flavor but there's this buttery note and it's even in the mouth feel.  Water brings out old leathery bourbon and the butter leaves the foreground but remains on the finish.

This is very much an off profile knob creek and it's wonderful bourbon.  I'm going 3.75 but I seriously considered a 4.0.  But lets save that for exceptional whisky and not just my favorite Knob Creek to date.  I will note that at 45 bucks the value here is insane and this is why I recommend people try as many knob creek single barrels as they can.  Even the non store picks can be exceptional and I really do mean exceptional."
3.0,"So a store pick this will be Gallenstein Selection #16 coming in the new packaging.  2/10/2004 to 2/7/2019 so we're about 15 years old here.  

Nose - It's sweet, rich caramel yes, but brown sugar, some cinnamon, creme pie, custard, vanilla.  Oh there's even some chocolate here, it's big, it's dark.  There's strong evenly balanced finished oak.  I'm not getting 15 year old notes here, the oak is a bit more raw than a really old aged wood but still there's some age here.  We end up with a nice balance between oak and sweet really really good.  Water tames the oak and brings out the nice vanillas.  

Taste - Opens with a nice sweet note but quickly turns into dusty oak and then nutty notes, then in the finish some spice and then a funk and oak and yet there's still a nice sweet element.  A drop of water pushes the vanilla out just like it does in the nose.  Very oak forward still and really complex oak.

I have done this blind with ECBP A119 and I picked this over it.  I'm not a huge blind fan as sometimes one whisky makes another taste better and it wouldn't be that way without the head to head.  Still this one holds up well.  It's not as sweet and it has more oak notes.  It is much more complex and has more transitions and nuances.  I can however see some off notes.  

3 stars, a fine dram and I know this single barrel is likely gone, but with any single barrel batch variation is life, not just store picks.  This is better than any bookers will ever be (maybe not a 30 or something like that) so take that with what it is worth (I'm not sure I'll ever review a bookers as I don't generally care for their quality to price)."
4.25,"Nose: Brown sugar, toffee.   Buttery, bready biscuit. Pepper.  Fruity, slight banana.  Maraschino cherry.  Cereal grain.  Cardamom, clove.

Palate: Brown sugar.  Buttery biscuit.  Black pepper.  Bright fruit.  Peppermint in the very back.  Beautiful perfume fueled by alcohol.

4.75,"Nose: Vanilla, oak, brown sugar.  Classic bourbon.  Char.  Citrus.  Ethanol is helping everything jump out of the glass.  Dark fruits, peaches, strawberries, cherries, banana.  
Slightest rye space.  Peanuts.

Palate: Immediate brown sugar and oak, vanilla, tannin, char.  Bold without being overbearing.  The 120 proof shows up bigtime.  Fruity complexity dances around - strawberry, banana, peach, cherries, stone fruits.  Long, pleasant finish with bursts of sweet floral character.  Slightly buttery biscuit-y thing going on in there.

Other notes: This is still an amazing drink.  Spot on price:quality ratio.  I could get lost in this stuff for a long time.  Definitely one to respect - also shows you just how much of a difference 20 proof makes - compare against regular Knob Creek and you get a great lesson.  This is a bottle I always make sure to have on hand.  Objectively it's not perfect - it can be a little harsh and powerful at times, and there are some deficiencies in the overall balance.  That being said, it's almost perfectly aligned with my palate and preferences."

3.75,"On the nose, the classic Beam flavors are coming through.  They aren't as rich or rounded as other Beams like Baker's and Bookers.  Nonetheless, it is still quite good.  This isn't something I'd drink everyday because of the high proof, but flavors are good for the price.  However, there really isn't anything about it that makes it special.  Don't get me wrong; it's very good, just not very memorable."
3.25,"This particular bottle was purchased early 2019 from Liquor Barn in Lexington.  The plaque states to be a 14yr barrel rather than the 9yr on the printed label.  Bottle has been opened twice since then and put back due to the bear-spray like sensation it left me with.

The color is dark amber but the nose is a little off putting for me but likely not for all - roast peanuts and toffee.  There is also some warm vanilla and pepper - and ethanol astringency.  The fumes make my eyes water if I get close enough to the glass... I’m thinking 120+ proof if that’s possible.

Oh the burn!!!  White pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg?  Leather whip to the face.  Vanilla in the background.  I don’t think I should breathe near open flame.  

Looking back at the legs they practically don’t move.  By this point some of the toffee and vanilla are coming back up my sinuses and the oak and leather sit on the back of my tongue.  

2 drops of water - a move I rarely take.  Vanilla toffee bomb!  Now we’re talking.  The burn is still there but more balanced with the oak and leather notes.

I’ve never had Stagg Jr but I can’t help but wonder if these are similar... time to hunt."

P(4.25): first taste was hot first sip of the day. Sweet bomb of all types of sweetness. Fruit, brown sugar. Pins and needles on the tongue with a boat load of baking spice and vanilla on the end
F(4.25): very long butter oak taste with a deep Kentucky bear hug. Creamy vanilla has a medium length combined with a dash of whip cream sweetness. 

Totally bang for your buck. I’m going to hunt for a store pick. When this runs out, I’m replacing it right away. Can’t beat the value for price."

null,"Deep, rich color. Spruce, menthol, cardamom, and caramel apple on the nose. Viscous mouthfeel and not too vapourous for the proof. Some fruit leather notes on the front palate is balanced out by a cinnamon spice finish. 

Wasn't crazy about it at corkpop, but about 20% into the bottle it really calms down and is a bold, spicy, dessert."
3.0,Good burn. Intense heat on the swallow. Smooth going down. A subtle hit of vanilla at the very end. Great Bourbon for being 120proof very drinkable.
4.5,"This is a 9yr Single Barrel Reserve store pick from Discount Liquor in Nashville, TN. I have another pick from this store that is pushing 15yrs and is fantastic. Let’s see how they did ok this one.


The nose has freshly baked sweet yeast rolls leaping out with vanilla, oak, dark cherries and rye.

The palate is semi-sweet with oak, leather, dark cherries, brown sugar, corn and some rye.

The finish is nice and long with dark cherries and oak lingering, with the sides of the tongue tingling.

This is very good. Discount Liquor is now 2 for 2 on the KC Single Barrel picks. This is uniquely different than the almost 15yr old one that I have. Both are great! These have to be the best deal in bourbon for Barrel Proof Single Barrels."

4.5,"Typical golden color slightly on the darker side. Legs are skinny and not as viscous as I would expect from a 9 year old bourbon, likely due to higher proof. Nose is strong but none too harsh, spicy and oaky, with limited sweetness. On the palate, 120 proof hits hard but is surprisingly smooth. Quite spicy, vanilla is much more prominent now. Finish is beautifully long, slow, and warm. As a rye whiskey lover, this is a fantastic bourbon with similar characteristics. Combining the low cost, high ABV, and complex yet smooth flavors, this is great bang for your buck."

3.5,Dark amber in the glass. Strong ethanol on the nose that gives way to a little caramel after letting it breathe for 10 minutes. A good pour. Tasted right after Baker's and I liked Baker's better though it's hard to say why. There's just not a lot here that stands out.
4.5,"Revisiting this with a more complete review picture.  I'm a Knob Creek fan.  I started drinking the original 9 year 100 proof sometime in 1993, right after it was released.  It was love at first sight.  I've been a scotch head since the 80's, with a side deal with Canadian whiskies.  I never really cared for bourbon much. My best friend was wholly committed to Maker's Mark at the time and, frankly, that wasn't my jam.

Fast forward 25 years.  After being less that impressed with the NAS 100 proof I'd stopped drinking it.  Honestly I  didn't notice that loss of the age statment. What I noticed was that it just didn't move the monkey anymore. And if you're a whisky-head then you know that damn monkey had better be dancin' or you're out buying a fresh bottle of something.  And through some bizarre law of physics, something is never less expensive than the last thing...  

Its not like KC became bad, but it just didn't sparkle anymore.

Then I found a 9 year old, 120 proof single barrel masterpiece.  It had been released because... and get this... evidently a bunch of folks like me had just lost interest in Knob Creek. 

And you know what? 

Love again!  

AND THEN I HAD A STORE PICK THAT WAS TRULY EXTRAORDINARY!.  

Holy corn juice, Batman!  That bottle got the monkey break dancing!

This is one of my ""core selections"".  

These are the bottles I could enjoy forever.  

Knob Creek Single Barrel, Wild Turkey Rare Breed, Old Grand Dad 114, George Dickel Bottled in Bond, and Evan Williams Single Barrel.  

The WT and KCSB are tied for first in my heart.

This KCSB is sweet, complex and sophisticated.  I don't need to list what it tastes like or smells like. Go get a bottle! THIS is what great bourbon tastes like!

Ordinarily I'd say this is a solid 4. That is to say it's top 20% of every bourbon I've ever had.  Better than 4 out of every 5.  And I'm standing by that.  Keep that damn BT or ER, I'm drinking this.  

And once in a while, because this is a single barrel and they have some variability, you get a bottle that just satisfies.  Its delicious. It checks all the boxes.  Strong. Sweet. 
Complex.  Aromatic. Full flavored. There's just nothing more you can ask from a $45 bottle.  

I'm having a generous pour from a bottle like that right now.  With chocolate covered strawberries.  And my wonderful wife of 40 years next to me. How good does ice cream get? 

And so I ask you; what more can one want from a whiskey?"

2.0,"This highlights the sometimes vast differences between store picks and the standard offering.  The Total Wine in Charleston has had three different store picks of this, and they've been consistently very good. That consistent goodness prompted me to grab a bottle of the standard fare.  That was my first mistake. My second mistake was taking an inattentive big sip right after the first pour.  Fire! Boiling Water! Oak branch to the face! Tears! Burning in my nose!  Ugh!  My third mistake was thinking it would mellow with a little time.  Nope!  I've finally given up, and mixed this with a bit of Eagle Rare and water, and it's ok.  Similar to Wild Turkey 101, but not as smooth or as sweet. There are a lot of better options at this price point, to include the aforementioned Wild Turkey 101. I won't be buying this again."

4.25,"Knob Creek Single Barrel 9YR

NOSE: An overall Musty Quality. Raw Peanut, Savoriness, Old Oak, Dusty Barnyard, Some Light Vanilla/Caramel in the back that builds the longer it sits. The nose on the empty Glencairn is all Cinnamon. There was an odd overwhelming ""mildewy"" note on the first pour (think sponge that has soured) that became more of the musty quality that I noted on future pours. I have never gotten bottle of Whiskey that had gone bad (cork taint, etc), but I thought maybe this was the first. Odd.
NEAT: Thick and Clingy Mouthfeel. Oak, Cocoa Powder, Sticky Toffee & Peanut Brittle, Black Coffee with Sugar. A little Bitter Oak on the backend. A pleasant Heat/Tingle that builds on the sides of the tongue and cheeks. A respectable Kentucky Hug that blooms in the chest.Peanut, Vanilla, and Musty Oak coats the palate. The oak continues to layer and become more pronounced with each sip. VERY good.
SPLASH: A little water doesn't change much. Gives the nose a ""burnt"" quality. Oddly, makes it a little hotter? Sweetens the palate into Coca Cola. Takes away an of the bitter tannins that were present. Makes the Musty Oak dominant. Almost becomes like a ""Double Oaked"" whiskey.

Verdict: This is my first bottle of KCSiB. I had tried it a couple years ago at a family get together and remember liking it. However, it was a store pick from somewhere in Indiana and I did not have the time/opportunity to evaluate it properly. I really like Beam products that have a little extra age and proof on them. The price used to be a little of a stumbling block for me, but with HMcK10, 4RSiB, and others cresting the $40 mark it is actually becoming a decent buy."

4.0,"Knob Creek Single Barrel Reserve 9 Year is my first try at Knob Creek and it did not disappoint whatsoever. I did find it rather difficult to remove the wax to open the bottle, but once the corked was pulled, the aromas were quite wonderful. Knob Creek Single Barrel Reserve is matured for 9 long years using new American white oak casks in Clermont, KY. Knob Creek Single Barrel Reserve 9 Year is made of 75% corn, 13% rye, 12% malted barley and bottled at 120 proof/60% ABV making it one of the better high proof bourbons I have tasted. However, the bourbon is more enjoyable with water added which brings out more robust flavors, aromas, and only enhances the balance.

Color: Fantastic Amber Gold

On the nose are hints of maple sweetness, vanilla, charred oak, honey, and a heavy aroma of cinnamon spice. Following is a warming, rich and creamy vanilla taste on the palate with hints of pepper, cinnamon spice, and oak with a pleasant balance of sweetness, spice and a nice complexity. The 60% ABV is calmed a bit by the rich vanilla sweetness. The finish is long continuing its warmth with hints of brown sugar, caramel, some baking spices, and has a slight leatheriness to it."

On the nose, I get strong notes of vanilla, caramel, and oak char with lighter floral notes, maraschino cherry, red apple, roasted peanuts, brown sugar, and maple syrup. The taste doesn't match the nose completely and in comparison presents a much stronger nuttiness, and tobacco note. The brown sugar/ maple syrup note evolves into a unison dense molasses note.  The lighter fruit notes on the nose get buried for the darker sweet notes on the taste. The finish is long, somewhat dry, and barrel forward with baking spice on the back end. Really enjoy this bourbon but it is one that you have to be in the mood for."

3.0,"Neat. Opened two months.  Found this all store pick from Party Source stashed in the back of my bar.  13 year from April 2018.  My first impression was just okay but I didn’t have a chance for a review at the time.  

Nose is quite dark, cinnamon and baking spice bomb.  It’s a hot one too, can’t get too deep or the alcohol gator bites my nose.  Caramel and oak.   I’ll call this average like my first impression but there is a note I really like.  Like charred marshmallow or meringue, like if you pull out a torch and do it to a baked Alaska.  I like that note.

Bit watery, not as thick and vicious.  All cinnamon, baking spices and oak again.  Not a fan of this one.  First impression is holding true.  It’s bitter.  Drying in a bad way.  Cotton mouth.

Barrel 6779 is just not a winner for me.  Least favorite Knob Creek store pick I have had.  I’ll see if I can mix with it.  I usually never open another Knob Creek until the current one is done.  May have to make an exception on this one.  Bah."

4.5,"Neat. Neck pour.  Store pick - Gallenstein Selection 22, 15 year 4 months!  Might be my oldest Knob Creek yet.  Hmmm, brighter than I was expecting on the nose for being this old.  It’s cherry and vanilla leading.  Nutmeg, cinnamon.  Barrel char.  I’d have a tough time guessing the age on this blind.  The color is dark but it is bright initially.  

I let it sit for a bit and the caramel is emerging.  It’s that hard caramel that my grandma carried in her purse.  Worthington’s right?  The oak is more there as well.  This one may change significantly now that it is opened.  

Rich and creamy, cinnamon and brown sugar take of the mouth instantly.  Zero Beam nuttiness.  Not even a hint.  I might mistake this for Buffalo Trace it is that off profile.  Cherry and even a slight hint of orange.  So sweet.  Super bright and rich vanilla.  Some caramel coming out too.  The oak only shows up on the very back end and it’s just a hint.  The more I sit with it, I start getting cola even.  Cherry cola.

Man, this is a good pick and I needed a good pick.  Last Knob I cracked sucked.  This one comes roaring back.  Shocked by the flavor profile.  A cherry forward, zero nuttiness Knob Creek?  A 15 year with only a hint of oak?  I may compare this later to EHT Barrel Proof later.  It is more in line with than than a Beam product.  So strange but utterly delicious."
