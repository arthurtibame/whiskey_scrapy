3.75,"Nose - Gentle sweet brioche, baked apples, hints of cedar wood, toasted almonds, vanilla

Taste - Sweet spicy cinnamon/oak heat/tartness, gentle sweet apples, light apple stem/seed/peel bitterness, toasted soft brioche bread

Finish - Lingering light cinnamon tingle/warmth, bitter/fruity apple stem/seed/peel lingers

Score - 80/100

Final Thoughts - This was overall a very pleasant dram. Nice nose that shows promise, but sadly doesn't quite deliver on the palate. Still very pleasant at first as the Calvados influence is present but not overwhelming/overpowering the base spirit. Sadly there is this fruity bitter aspect that is a bit distracting to the entire experience since all of the flavors in this malt are quite subtle. Overall quite nice, but the bitterness from start to finish gets a bit distracting.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - Probably not another"

4.0,Best (read only) Swedish Single Malt I’ve ever had! Earthy and Smokey with fruity overtones (12 Advent19)
3.75,"Apple and pear are strong, especially in the back end. Fun diversion!"
3.0,I also smell Apple Jacks. A little harsh and spicy. Sweetness layered in. Improved with second sip.
3.75,"Nose: Slight citrus. Green and red apples. Toffee with hints of vanilla. Melted butter. Elegant and floral.

Palate: Very smooth texture with apple-like sweet fruitiness. More toffee - like sugar-coated apples basically. 

Finish: Toffeelike sweetness and apple (less the acidity of apples). Touches of breadsticks. Eventually some hints of milk chocolate. 

Overall: A very well integrated finish that really works without being overpowering. Elegant and interesting, not overly complex, but still a really good whisky: 3.75 points."
4.25,Toffee apple and pear. Apple Jacks!
