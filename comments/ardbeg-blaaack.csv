4.5,"Yes it's another limited NAS annual release from Ardbeg but this is a unique and very good offering. They did the 20th Anniversary right too bad it's like other good ones like Dark Cove or Kelpie it will never become a core release. Nose is very much like Uigeadail with it's rich wine influence however Uigeadail is sherry finished this one is Pinot Noir matured. I cannot find if it's blend of ex-bourbon and pinot noir or straight Pinot casks; the label suggests the latter. Right off the bat you'll notice this ins't as smoky as a typical Ardbeg and on the taste it's rounder and denser tasting not as many flavor spikes suggesting some quite mature casks or the pinot heavily dominates the smoke and youthful taste. Other than that it's back to the Uigeadail nose the molasses, and bacon are pronounced, the rich dark fruits from the wine, tart Michigan pie cherries, touch of burnt honey slight ardbeg citrus and an aromatic sweet smelling wood note. Taste is reminding me of Corryvreckan as it's a bit spicy to start with but it's not as intense as Corry and fades quickly, smoke and smoked meat come through behind the spice almost a smoked peppered bacon then it's all sweet, fruit and some barrel/wood notes. The tart cherry with a strawberry (Ardbeg 17???)  and blackberry note along with the honey and syrup sweetness and then the nice oak and barrel char usually associated with bourbons. Finish is long as an Ardbeg is a mint type note shows up late palate/early on the finish when mixed with the tart cherry note and syrup sweetness makes almost a sweet cherry cough medicine taste settling into barrel char and honey/syrup sweetness. If you are fans of Uigeadial you'll really like this whisky and it's similarities, if you like Corryvreckan you'll like this whisky wishing for more spice and punch (if you can get it the White label committee release might have it), if you like both of those you'll love this whisky. Sadly it's almost already sold out in a lot of areas so if you are interested pull the trigger on this one quick as it won't linger on shelves like Grooves did."
