3.75,"it's a very nice single malt but I was hoping for alot more at that price and age.  very light finish.  maybe it because it's just 40% alc.  there was nothing particularly memorable about it.  I'll give it another shot when we have company so I can get a second opinion.   maybe I wasn't in the right mood or I was just expecting way too much.  

I would much rather have some of my other aged single malts.  bushmill 21 is my current favorite that I have.  it feels much richer and more balanced than this 40 yr old.  I was expecting something more like that."
