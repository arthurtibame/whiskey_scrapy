4.0,"Reminiscent of a Lagavulin 16, but not quite as smooth. Still quite tasty, with a great smokey/peaty flavor that finishes with a nice, warm burn."

3.0,Brine. Seaweed. Buttered maple. Caramel. Herbal peat. Light smoke. Very nice
3.0,"As in the spirit of the Northwest, I admire this whiskey to mimic a style I love dearly. To import peated malted barley from Scotland and age it for 3 years takes a lot of guts and I like that. It would be interesting to see how it stacks up against Islay scotches in a blind tasting. I thought it was smooth enough and reminded me of a lighter Islay like Bowmore. The question of whether or not it's better than the real thing is yet to be determined."

1.0,This was a first - I've never involuntarily retched after taking a sip of whiskey.  Think of the fertilizer / chemical smell at your local hardware store lawn care section - that is what you will be tasting. Nothing even remotely good about this swill.  I'm surprised they released it.

3.0,"Nose like a burning hospital. Eases off over time, leading to pine, mesquite, smoked salt. Ends with a bit of a whimper. Gives you barbecue breath."

5.0,"i heard it rumoured that mccarthy was, if not emulating lagavulin 16, inspired by it in crafting this single malt...i can feel that...while not quite as overtly magical as the lag 16, the mccarthy is a very sophisticated and balanced dram that has a magic all its own...the smoke is potent but clean and not nearly overwhelming...totally reminiscent of a lakeside campfire...i'm instantly a fan!"

3.5,"Brown sugar/paprika pork rub over a campfire. sweet and smoky with a faintly salty edge. it's like a younger, sweet ardbeg"
3.25,"Nose - Sweet campfire smoke, sweet cereal malt, tiny hint of dark toffee, very faint hint of berries

Taste - Sweet campfire smoke, very light apple juice sweet, hint of vanilla & caramel sweet, brown simple, light kettle corn metallic

Finish - Light sweet campfire smoke, light kettle corn metallic, metallic apple juice

Score - 77/100

Final Thoughts - So this is a very clean and simple lightly peated malt. I can tolerate the peat in this one as it's a lot cleaner, drier smoke than that of Laphroaig. That being said, it's also a fairly simple malt too where I struggled to find many flavors other than that of a straightforward cereal malt. Tiny hints of apple & maybe some berries, but that was pushing it. The kettle corn metallic taste was a bit strange but not too unpleasant. This might be a decent intro to a lightly peated malt but I think it might be a bit boring.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

4.25,"Nose: briney/smokey/peaty, but with a herbaceous and heathery/honeysuckle notes.

Taste: Heavy peat and smoke, with classic Islay notes of salt, bacon, and iodine. 

Finish: long, salty/bacony but with some herbal freshness coming through, breaking up the peaty richness with some brightness"
3.5,Its getting much better as it opens up from oxidation!
2.75,Not a horrible try for a 4 year peated whiskey from Oregon
4.0,This is a Scotch with a slight smoke flavor

3.25,"Nose 
• Peat, charred peanuts, malty, charred, salty sea air. After tasting i get a campfire and almonds on the nose.

Taste
• Very quick tangy citrus to start. Burnt peanut. Salty but quite tangy. Ever so slightly bandaid medical. Peaty. A little citric again."

3.5,This is very interesting. Rye up front and peet on the finish. Definitely not as peety as the reviewer says
4.5,Very very smokey/campfire equivalent. A little sting on the nose. Very lasting aftertaste. Nearly a sour but vanilla bite to it.
4.0,"Nose:  Medium peat smoke. Hickory, bacon, blackened BBQ, vanilla bean, light aroma of rubber. Action figures. 

Flavor: Heavier peat and smoke than the aroma would lead you to believe. Mesquite bbq, pineapple, bold green apple, bitter dark chocolate, butter and burnt caramel. Oak and earth notes, leather, rum and a hint of cinnamon. None of sea or iodine of the best Islay scotch. More reminiscent of Laphroig 10 or Caol Ila 12 than a selection from Ardbeg or Lagavulin. A great combination of a Oregon and Scotland. 

Water dilutes it too much. A pour with a stone cools it and brings out the sweetness and fruit notes but dulls the complexity. Prefer served neat. My favorite American whiskey but then again, I love Scotch and this is very close to a scotch."

4.0,This is a peat monster. On the nose you get the peat but not what’s coming next. This has a big mouthfeel and peat abounds. Excellent finish that lasts. You feel this in the nostrils.

3.5,"Nose - Strong with peat upfront and straw, malt, vanilla and a slight hint of honey and lemon. 

Palate - Smooth smoke, straw, dark honey and clove, with lemon and barely sugar balancing it all out. 

Finish - Sugary and smokey with a slight tartness and spice that is clean and simple."
2.5,Nose is Smokey sweet like bbq chicken. Light on the palate initially followed by smoke and alcohol burn. Not very complex for a $50 bottle. Could use more than 3 years aging I suppose.

4.0,"Close your eyes and you’d swear this was a straight up Islay scotch whisky. It’s a bit of a
mashup with Islay malt distilled and aged here in Oregon. It’s absolutely amazing. It
Tastes much more complex than its 3 year age statement suggests. Definitely worth getting ahold of!"
