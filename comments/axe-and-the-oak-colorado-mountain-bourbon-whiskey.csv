3.0,"Nose: The nose is sweet, corn notes and candy corn with a floral bouquet that marks this as a very approachable bourbon.

Taste: The taste has a slightly stronger kick due to the higher alcohol content, but is sweet with caramel, vanilla, red cherries, and honey land on your pallet. It has a fresh almost minty finish.

Opinion: This is a great whiskey. It's definitely a bourbon to have on your wish list, I think it's worth trying! If you live in or near Colorado Springs and don't want a whole bottle, the distillery and whiskey house are for sure worth visiting too! (Get the ""Tobacco Old Fashioned""!) Cheers!"

3.5,Nice bourbon with a slight burn that lingers on the tongue. Has a slight scotchy taste.
2.5,"Young corn nose, sweeter than I would have assumed based on the spice on the finish"
4.0,"A bit young with strong corn notes. A sweeter bourbon, but it's pretty good in cocktails and neat. I wouldn't recommend on the rocks, it's a bit too mild for that and gets watered down quickly."
