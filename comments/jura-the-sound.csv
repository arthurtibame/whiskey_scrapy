4.0,"Recently (not THAT recently) Jura released a series of expressions matured in Pedro Ximenez sherry casks, which represents something iconic of the isle of Jura. I have now tasted all three (i believe they later released a fourth one called ""the paps"") and i loved the previous two: The Road and the Loch. This one, The sound, has been matured in casks that previously held the marvelous Pedro Ximenez Sherry for at least 15 years, this one been the youngest in that matter, since the other two were matured in casks that held the same time of fortified wine for 20 and 30 years.

It is said that the isle of Jura has a special ""sound"" and this bottle is a commemoration of that particular perk of the archipelago. 

Bottled at 42.5% abv, deep copper color.

On the nose, it is rather nice. Uncorking, gives you cinnamon notes.  First aroma you find on the glass is Baked apples. Grassy peat / earthy. Maple syrup, old and thick. Old almost rancid orange peel.
Dim citric notes.  A mild cigarrete aroma surrounds it. Less sweet than the other two Juras previously mentioned. Thick pineapple marmalade. Blackberry. Old cirus fruits peel. Some red fruits, old and syrupy. Blackberry marmalade after first sip, very nice. 

On the palate it is good, follows the same path: Tropical fruits like Pineapple and Peaches. Very gentle. Cinammon spice. 

Aftertaste gives you a completely different punch that somehow barely fits in there. There is a nice puff of smoke, followed by a dim pepper note and spicyness that sticks on your tongue for some time, nice but ""ghostly"". Grassy, burnt hay finish.

Overall i think this one is my least favorite of this collection, there was a lot missing here that you can find in the other two expressions. Not bad at all, but normal /nice. 82 over 100."

3.5,"A nice easy drinker.  It's not dramatically complex, but there are nice tastes of caramel, nuts, raisins, and a touch of saltiness on the palate.  The peat is very light.  I bought this in a 375 ml bottle at the Reykjavik airport (perfect size for the amount of my time in Iceland).  Certainly not a must buy for me, but was enjoyable and a good value.  I've also tasted Jura's seven wood (excellent), and this whisky has encouraged me to further explore Jura's offerings."
