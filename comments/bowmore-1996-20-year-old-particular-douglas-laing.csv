4.5,"This was one of 274 bottles from a refill hogshead (DL12109).  This single cask was distilled on 12/1996 and bottled 9/2017.

This is a flawless bourbon matured peated Islay whisky.  It is Japanese in its precision and balance, but definitely Islay in its character.

There is a light yet rich fruity nose.  Pineapples and custard.  The peat is much lighter than what you get on the palate.  Palate is floral, vanilla, and very peaty.  The finish is spicy and peppery.

This whisky tastes light for its 51.5% ABV, and can be enjoyed with or without a touch of water.  I am most impressed by its complete absence of offputting notes, and I am sad I probably won’t be able to find a replacement bottle.

Score: ** (Unimaginably good) 
How much did I buy the bottle for: $175 
How much do I think a bottle is worth: $275"
