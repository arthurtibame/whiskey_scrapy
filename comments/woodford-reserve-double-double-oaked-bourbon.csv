3.0,Very oaky with a lot of spice. Decent flavor but can be over powering.
4.0,"Smokey, oak and hint of sweetness. Dry. Don't drink after a sweeter bourbon/blend as it looses some of the enjoyment of the bourbon."
3.0,One glass is just about too much.  SO.much. oak. flavor.  Probably pass this one around to friends to try.

5.0,"I am a bit surprised by the expert's review for this because I found my taste of this to be somewhat magical.

Experienced at a tasting event, this managed to set itself apart despite a sea of other quality bourbons. I absolutely loved this for it's smooth, subtle chocolate notes, like a dark cacao tea with a hint of brown sugar.  I also noticed an interesting chalkiness to the mouthfeel that was quite pleasant.

This gets high marks for it's uniqueness, silky texture, and discernable refinement"

3.0,"Not much of a nasal, has more of a generic whiskey smell. Has a fruity and floral taste going down with a slight caramel taste in the back of the throat. There’s warmth when it hits the belly but isn’t spicy going down."
4.0,smooth
3.0,You can really smell the oak (duh). Spicier than the typical WR. The extra extra oaking helps that.  Leathery vanilla on the tongue but not as creamy as double oaked.  Long finish really hangs onto the tongue.
