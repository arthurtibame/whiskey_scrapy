4.5,This bourbon was extremely well flavored. It was one of the few bourbons I've had recently that just felt comfortable by itself that you can just keep on the tip of the tongue.
2.0,Ugh. I like to support small distillers but this was not good. Tasted weirdly like clay to my pallete.

3.5,"Batch 74, Bottle 18, 3yr9mo

Red corn, winter wheat, malted barley.

Verdict: A pretty respectable and drinkable offering from a craft distiller, but some unconventional notes on the nose and palate keep this from being a solid keeper.  I enjoy it and will finish it, but won’t seek another bottle.

A gentle amber with a reddish tint.  Thin legs.

A yeasty and bold unsweetened oatmeal aroma dominates the nose along with a strong dairy note, like a dollop of yogurt or clotted cream. Very unusual in a bourbon.  No ethanol.  Very little sugar/toffee.

More oatmeal on the palate, but this time with brown sugar and a touch of maple syrup.  Still some lactose present.  Thin viscosity, but imparts an enjoyable creaminess, like creme brûlée.  Some heaven hill-like peanut butter - not sweet enough to be peanut brittle.

The finish is long and semi-spicy cherry, like a sugar free Dr. Pepper.  Some peanut notes also linger, conflicting with the cherry."
