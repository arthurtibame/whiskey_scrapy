4.0,"The nose on this scotch reminds me more of the vineyard itself rather than the winery, if that makes any sense.  The scents are earthy and suggestive of hard work out in the fields:  fresh sapling wood, leather, dark soil, farm funk, and some permanent marker.  I did not experience much sweetness on the nose.  This felt like a slight twist on that dry, chalky distillery character.  The palate is dry and slightly astringent, with a big dose of medicinal minerality again, bittersweet apple skins, mint, and herbs.  On the swallow, more of the same:  brine, spearmint, and dry minerality.  It seems as if that distillery character or signature powered through the cask selection, or even gained strength like a hurricane over warm water, drawing the earthy and dry notes from Burgundy wine rather than the sweeter, fruitier notes.
  
  One final curiosity is that I haven't seen any discussion out there about whether the casks used were red or white wine, or a mix of both.  Given that this is not a single-barrel release but in fact was several thousand bottles, the distillery easily could have done a mix of a few different types of casks (Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, etc.).  My personal guess would be that there's more white than red in here, or that the reds were quite dry, because there is not a huge amount of fruit in this release.  That being said, the dark color suggests that a decent proportion must be aged in red wine casks.  Thanks to Telex for the sample!"
4.0,"Ha haaa! The theme of this dram is the Average White Band's ""Pick Up the Pieces"". Dat nose is funky, but gooood. Vanilla, cake batter, rich red, red wine (maybe this should be an UB40 song?) and woody elements. The palate - oh man, this is a ""daddy size"" piece of New York cheesecake with extra strawberry syrup. The finish is long, and dare I use the cliche ""smooooth"". Only a few drops of water with this guy. It may be hard to track down at this point, but WELL worth the effort."
4.0,Whisky & Alement Melbourne October 2017. A fine dram.
5.0,I've enjoyed red wine finished Scotch so far with Glenmorangie's Companta and The Arran's Amarone. I thoroughly enjoyed this as well. Full bodied and juicy.

3.0,"This is the second time Springbank leaves me on the fence with one of its expressions (the other being the 9 Gaja Barolo). A part of me gives it a 4, and another really perplexed part of me gives it a 3. The burgundy casks have really muted the typical Springbank flavor profile (and if you love this Campbeltown distillery that's a letdown).  As for the predominant winy element... if you love wine finishes, you'll love this. If you don't... good luck."

4.0,"Campbeltown Chronicles #3: After wetting my appetite with Longrow CV (disappointing) and Kilkerran 12 (outstanding), I continued my exploration of Campbletown with this limited edition 12-year-old from Springbank. Unsurpringly, the burgundy cask has tinted the liquid a lovely rosewood hue that positively exudes warmth. The nose and flavor is a beguiling combination of peat and a vegetal note that reminds me (oddly) of the funky flavors I love in Lock Stock & Barrel's 16-year rye. The peat swells to Islay levels (more than the label ""medium"" would imply) before ceding ground to the earthy notes, which settle into your mouth for the evening. Altogether fascinating and worthy of more exploration that my small sample allowed."

3.75,"Picked a couple of these up online recently, likely paid too much but that's the market.

Nose - classic springbank funk. Heavy vanilla icing, salted malt, and some dark red wine notes. Very much taking on some levels of soy sauce notes with classic springbank sweet and funky notes. You can't miss the distinct springbank. Water brings out sweetness, alcohol, and showcases these wine casks. 

Taste - The taste is more springbank springbank and springbank . Reminds me a hell of a lot of a 12 CS. Water makes this drink a lot sweeter, as we all know at CS SB wants us to play with water and I think a drop or two really is a perfect spot. The wine casks really jump out and you really get that burgundy profile. At the same time the whisky remains springbank funk with that salty and ever so slightly peated whisky notes. 

This is hands down my favorite 12 year (it's about 12.5 years old) old whisky to date. It's not really significantly better than a 12 CS and to be honest side by side I'd be interested in how different they are.

Actually - test. 

So 56.2 which isn't my favorite 12, but the first one I grabbed. So this 12 is seriously not one of their better ones, been drinking on some others, wow. OK so a bit more bite to the funk. The finish is a bit more citrus and lingering, the higher use of likely refill bourbon casks gives off more oak funk and bitterness. Overall the 12 CS as you'd expect is a much more old world type funky, sour, bitter experience. Meanwhile the Burgundy is more BBQ, salt, savory and sweeter. 

Anyway, I'm digging this 12 year Burgundy wood. It's springbank through and through (and yeah I'm saying this because other reviews have said otherwise, and I cannot more strongly disagree and I'm someone with 30 or so springbanks on the shelf), but it adds this incredible finishing and I find I like a depth in the finishing that sometimes gets lost on more used casks.

4.0,"I took count of my backlog of samples, and it turns out I have over 70...SEVENTY!!  I’m really slacking. Some of them go back over a year. I really need to put in some overtime on these things. This one comes from by way of @Telex. This Springbank was aged for 12 years in Burgundy casks. Bottled at 53.5% ABV and is non chill filtered and natural color of a dark amber. 

The nose is sweet on top with the classic Springbank funk underneath. Light vegetal peat, sulfur, very aromatic. Rich burgundy notes as well as salted caramel, chocolate and vanilla. Mixed berry pie filling, raspberries, blueberries and blackberries, maple and toffee. Meaty, more of that Springbank funk and Worcestershire sauce. Mineral notes, herbal, hay. 
Water isn’t needed but I added some anyway to see what would happen. A bit of orange citrus and not much else. Much better without water. 

Plenty of heat on the arrival but a good heat. Earthy peat, pepper. Dark berries, dense grain breads, oak, wine notes and red grapes. Salted caramels, mineral funk and a bit of mint. 
Water brings out something akin to nuttiness, but I’m not sure if that’s it. Also a little tobacco. Again, no water needed here, much better neat. 

A medium to full bodied mouthfeel that is oily and mouth coating. 
The finish is medium long with that Springbank funk, winey, grapes, berries, mineral notes and dry. 

Definitely a Springbank, no doubts there. The question is how I feel about it. I’m constantly barraged with others glowing opinions about this distillery, but I haven’t decided if I like it or not. I didn’t care for the 12 CS, the 13 Green was good but very odd, but I did have a 24 year old from Maltman that was exquisite. I’ve got a bottle of the 10 year old, plus a bottle of Longrow 18, but of course if I open them it will take time away from my samples...decisions decisions. This one was a good variant with the burgundy casks adding a nice level of complexity. I think I just need to try a few more to really make up my mind. As for this one, I’d give it a 3.75-4. 
Cheers"
4.5,"I tried this for the first time with @KoryH in April, sipped on it again in late May after J and I found out we were going to be parents, savored it at the beach in July, and have spent time with it on candlelit Saturday nights and on contemplative Sunday afternoons. Last night I finished off a generous pour after an excruciating week of witnessing the deepest evils humans are capable of. Much like life as I’ve experienced it lately, this 2016 limited release whisky from Springbank is a nemesis, complicated and multifaceted. The analogy breaks down in that this whisky is beautiful and delightful through and through. On the nose is salted papaya, the heavy aroma of late-summer gardenia, new leather, Manuka honey, black plums, and rhubarb. The longer it sits, the more the sweet wineyness mellows out, and the maritime signature wafts up as the dram continues to open up. The palate is thick and sweet in the front – pomegranate being added to the flavors from the nose. Mid-palate, brine and spice follow the deep fruitiness. Cardamom, tarragon, cayenne-dusted cashews, crushed pepper… At the back of the mouth these sensations are tied together by a deep maltiness and luxurious roundness. This whisky is tannic and heated, numbing the cheeks and gums. The finish is a wash of berries, seawater, nuts, and maltiness, and its burn fades on the tongue only after several minutes. This exquisite whisky invokes daydreams of a chilly day at a North Atlantic beach, saturated with red wine. I’m so glad to have experienced this well-balanced and beautifully crafted single malt. Its sweetness, though tantalizing, never outshines the Springbank richness. What a memorable bottle of whisky…"

4.0,"I was sent a sample of this insane, Lowland whisky from my friend Jason.  This was a limited release back in 2016 that consisted of Springbank 12 year old that was aged for its entire term in Spanish, burgundy wine casks.  I had initially decided I would compare this one to the Tullibardine 228- which was also finished in burgundy wine barrels.  But, the two are so far apart in flavor and complexity I felt it wasn’t a fair comparo.

This Springbank is a near cask strength bottle coming in at a robust, brandy-like 53.5% ABV.  It’s a crystal clear, pink rose colored dram that makes long, skinny legs in the Glencairn.

The nose has to be one of the funkiest smelling malts I’ve ever experienced.  The hay and barnyard funkiness is almost all red wine/balsamic vinegar.  I seem to recall a similar smell from a bottle of saba that a chef friend of mine once gave me.  He said Saba is basically grape must (the skins, stems and seeds of fresh pressed grapes) that has been reduced to a sweet syrup and used in a lot of Italian sauces as the sweetening agent.  It’s very weird and distinct.  There’s a little bit of oak and heat from the high ABV, but it’s mostly funk.  

The palate is also super fruity:  strawberries, grapes and melon with a big time kick from the ABV.  The oak and some florals are there, but you really have to work this around the tongue and withstand the heat to even detect the slightest hints.  That’s the Springbank character, for sure, but it’s really fighting the burgundy funk just to be heard towards the end.

The finish just resonates everything from the nose:  funky, funky with wet hay and grapes that just lingers on well past the finish.  Even past the palate cleanser, water, vanilla wafer, saltine...you get the idea.  This thing lasts longer than even some of the smokiest Islay whiskies over ever tasted.  That’s astonishing.

Overall, well....I don’t really know how to rate this thing.  It’s an amazing testament to wine cask whisky.  It’s also a bold experiment by Springbank- they literally sacrificed their brand flavor profile here.  If I had tasted this blind there’s no way in hell I would’ve guessed it was theirs.  The only problem I see here is that this is so close to being a brandy, IMO, that I almost lost sight of the fact it’s a scotch.  That’s where I think your average whisky drinker will get lost.  I know, I know- I could’ve added some water and brought this down but I’m one of THOSE snobs that thinks the whisky should be drank the way the distillery intended it- as bottled.  If I had a full bottle I may have done that later on to try to open it up, but I wanted this one “as is” and that may have been too much.

Thanks to @Telex for this awesome pour.  It’s flavor is intense, I just think it misses the mark a little as a whisky (and even as a Springbank).  It’s 4.5 stars on its own, but I gotta downgrade it a bit for being too, too much (if that makes sense).  4-4.25 stars."
