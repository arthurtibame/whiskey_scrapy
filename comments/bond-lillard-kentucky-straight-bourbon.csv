3.75,"It’s been awhile since I tasted this at the WT distillery. From what I remember, it was very good as are most WT products. I certainly recommend trying it.

My one complaint.... the price. $50 to $60 per bottle is ridiculous!"

3.0,"The nose is like dessert, combination of coconut and pecan pie. Sharp flavor on the tongue, but velvety feel. Leather and butterscotch, slightly floral. Ends with walnut shells, a little bitterness. Slightly numbing. 11/7/18"

4.0,I love this bourbon. I don't agree with their review because I think it's spicier than they give it credit for. This has great balance and reminds me alot of the best flavors Wild Turkey has to offer.
2.0,Typical bourbon...not much flavor

4.5,"This year for the holidays I’m going to try a brand new whiskey every day in December. #lifegoals

Dec. 15

It is sincerely stupid how much time I pumped into trying to make the number 15 work with my existing bourbon collection. I ended up settling on the fact that in Vermont and Maine, the refund value for this bottle is 15 cents. Ladies and gentlemen, please hold your applause until the end of the review.

Nose is bitter. A hint of caramel, but mostly leather and brine. Some apple if I really hunt for it.

Body is sweet, and it feels very natural. Sometimes sweetness can seem syrupy and forced, but not here. That complete denial of my expectations was impressive. I get caramel apples, tangerine, and a bit of cane sugar.

Finish goes back to the nose for me. There is leather, brine, and a bit of caramel. It’s hot on the back of your tongue, but only in feel. Flavors are bitter here.

I’m really happy with this juice. I was worried after seeing the community average, but I think that number is too low. This batch really does do a good job, although I do understand the value/dollar argument could go against this little guy. You didn’t trick me Bond & Lillard. $60 for a 375mL means I expect $120 in value. I did that math in my head just now. Is this twice the value of a Rock Hill Farms? No. Is it 2.5 the value of a EHT Small Batch? No. But unlike those 2 delicious bourbons, in my area this is readily available, and if you have $60 to burn and want to try some unique and tasty juice, I certainly recommend. 

‘Tis the season. I don’t know if I actually have 16 more new whiskeys lined up, so if you’re reading this and there’s something readily available out there you’d like me to enjoy/suffer through this holiday season, leave it in the comments."

3.5,"Batch 2. Cedar, coconut, toffee, spice on nose, caramel, corn, and spice on palate with med. long finish, enjoying but a bit remorseful I spent over $50 for 375mL."
4.5,Batch #2. Slight Cinnamon
3.5,Sweet start with caramel corn finish. The spice of some rye on the sides of the palate. A few drops of water brings insane leveling to it. A bit expensive for a 375mL

3.75,"Light on the palette, but delicious. Not worth $50 for 375ml but worth a try for something different or when you're looking for something that won't beat you across the face with flavor."
4.0,Super spicy rye front with a mellow brown sugar lingering finish. Cinnamon Toast Crunch spice with tingly creaminess.
3.5,smooth and spicy
2.0,Smooth rubbing alcohol. Not strong positive flavors to note

4.25,It must be fairly hit or miss with this. the bottle I got was pretty good. I love bourbon so I am a sucker for just about anything but like things that are different.
