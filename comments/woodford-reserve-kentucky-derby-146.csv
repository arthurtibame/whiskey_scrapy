5.0,"Fantastic bourbon! Notes of caramel, orange zest followed by chocolate and toffee are present. Definitely a traditional Woodford with their mash bill of 72% corn, 18% rye and 10% malted barley. Beautiful bottle art from former Braves pitcher and sports painter Richard Sullivan. Considering this year’s Run for the Roses has been pushed  back due to COVID-19, this bottle is certain to be a collector’s item."
