3.25,"Neat. Bourbon Street pick.  I haven’t come back to this bottle in awhile. Caramel and wood chips.  Nice raspberry and maple.  The nose is subtle but it has some fun depth to explore.  Brightens up over time and the vanillas and baking spices come out.

Watery on the tongue with some general brown sugar and maple.  Just like nose, it starts with Caramel and oak.  Finish is raspberry and a simple syrup.  Just a sweet, rock candy like after taste.  Interestingly, the more time I spend sipping it, a sour and harsh note is emerging on the palate.  Now I am starting to get a nutty note on the finish.

It’s a basic bourbon with this little extra hit of oak elevating the experience.  The harsh sour note tainted subsequent sips.  Left the top of my mouth dry.  I enjoyed this less and less as I reached the bottom of the glass unfortunately."
