3.0,Not bad for the price. A bit bitter but it is relatively smooth and it has considerable body.

4.75,"Perfectly smooth and light, yet still quite rich. Sweet, but not overwhelmingly. Ideal for neat drinking on any occasion."
1.0,ugh.... noooooo
3.0,"I had the Colorado Crown Club, in a fancy Colorado flag bag.  It is the same whisky as this, just re-branded to the state it is sold in. There are several states that have this treatment.  You are mostly buying the packaging.  The whisky itself was nothing to write home about.  It had a gasoline smell when poured, but was decently smooth when chilled.  I like the bag, and it was worth a try, but I wouldn't buy it again."

4.0,Smooth.  Not bad at the price.
5.0,Pretty good product. Great flavor and I love collecting those Texas bags. Probably the best and smoothest whisky you will find for twenty bucks.
1.0,This is the first and hopefully last bottle of whiskey that I poured out. The Texas flag cloth sack marketing scheme worked on me so I bought it. I couldn't give this stuff away.

3.0,"Its an ""I'm on a budget"" whiskey. exceptionally smooth and can definitely taste a hint of caramel on your tongue. not my ""go to"" for ""budget"" whiskey but if its available when nothing else is then I'll drink it"
