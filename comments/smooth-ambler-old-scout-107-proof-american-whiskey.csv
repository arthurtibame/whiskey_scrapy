3.25,"Single barrel pick from Total Wine. MGP and Dickel sourced juice. 

Butterscotch and ethanol on the nose. 
Dickel vitamin hits on the palate, with some fruit and a lot of gritty corn dominating as well. 
Drying heavy oak and heat on the finish. 
Not worth the price of entry, pretty disappointing all in all. 

Admittedly reasonably smooth for the proof, but I like some flavor in my bourbon not just a smooth way to injest alcohol (sorry not sorry)."

null,"I’m tasting a hand select bottle (Barrel 12172). Nose is very nice, floral with oak, caramel, vanilla, maple and brown sugar, maybe some leather. Alcohol smell is a little strong but not overpowering. 
Palate, smooth up front and in the middle. Small punch in the back that lingers quite a while(107 Proof). Oak flavors, faint cherry, green apples. First taste, will report more later.
Added one ice cube and it changed completely.  It feels flat now. The nose is still very nice but the taste flattened out. I’ll try a few drops of water next time."

3.5,Citi store pick Atlanta. A bit corn forward like EHT small batch but pretty hot. Sweet but hot.

3.0,"A solid 3 star bourbon. This was a barrel pick out of NOLA. At 107 proof this bottle is relatively smooth with lots of flavor. It has that young unfinished taste, i bet finishing this bottle for a few more tears would be amazing. That said, fir $40 this is a great bottle to own. Its not a knock your socks off bourbon, but its rich with flavor, and worth a spot on your shelf."

3.75,"Neat.  Not too much on the nose.  Butterscotch and some floral notes with some searching.  Nice mouth feel with immediate brown sugar on the tongue.  Transitions to vanillas and spice.  Nutty.  Very smooth and mild for a 107 proof.  Legs don’t last too long.  It’s good, not great.  No offending characteristics, nothing blows me away.  Just a solid sipper all around."
2.75,"Adding a dash of water really compliments the flavors of this American Whiskey, so start there. On the nose, oak, vanilla and funnel cake. On the palate, sweet bread drizzled with caramel and paprika with a smooth bite of rye and limestone on the finish."

3.25,Lots of heat and spice. Too spicy for my usual liking. Not a bad bourbon overall
3.5,"Barrel #14439- Bold maple and brown sugar smell on the nose. Heavy taste of sugar with hints of cherry gives it a sweet but yet smooth burn. Not a heavy burn on the finish but the taste lingers for a few minutes. Behaves more like a bourbon beginning to mature than a regular whiskey. 

Barrel #10502. Smell of honey and leather.Taste although smooth yet not quite mature, Honey dominant reminds me of a slight ""Blade and Bow""flavor. Has some potential but not up to the standards of whiskey that you would pay 40 bucks for."

3.0,"A friend read somewhere that this was supposed to be MGP stock, so when I saw a bottle on my way out of the store, I figured I'd give it a go.  Nose is very light, mostly ethanol aromatics with just a whiff of sweet.  Given a few minutes, soft caramel shows up, but there's really not much happening. Palate starts just like the nose finishes; mild alcohol bite and creamy soft caramel. Sadly, it never really goes anywhere else, with just a touch of drying spiciness before finishing cleanly.  It's very inoffensive. Very mild.  Very neutral. Very unremarkable."

3.25,"Very grainy. Much more so than a typical bourbon.a good change of pace, but just pretty good."
3.75,"Saw this store pick at Pour Vous and for $35 I thought I’d check it out.
The nose at first had some ethanol. But then letting it sit for 5mins the alcohol vapors move aside and allows vanilla, butterscotch, and some smokeyness to come through.
The palate is semi sweet that has a lot of corn that jumps out. After the first sip, going back to the nose I get a lot more corn that wasn’t present before.
The palate continues with a little bit of Barrel and leather. The finish has a little bite. And it’s on the dryer side.
Adding about 5 drops of water this thing opens up really nicely. All of a sudden I get fruit on the nose. The palate is similar than before but I get some cherries this time.

All in all, a really nice bottle and price, especially for a store pick. This is one of the rare times where I think I enjoyed something more with just a few drops of water."
