4.0,"Seventh - and final - sample of a 7 part Kilchoman (custom) sample set my wife got me for my birthday last year. It's a limited Single Cask Release (678/2010), selected by and exclusively bottled for it's Dutch importer Bresser & Timmer. Distilled in 2010 and bottled in 2015, this 5 year old whisky has been finished in a PX Sherry Cask, and botled at a nice 57% with only 264 bottles available.

For over a year this nice dram had hidden itself between the samples of my perpetuum blend (*), until I recently rediscovered it in my cabinet. A few days ago I was an evening home alone, so a perfect moment for a movie and a nice dram.

On the nose, one is welcomed by a nice campfire, with some hints of BBQ and vanilla.
The palate also reveals dried fruits (raisins) and some apples. The Sherry influences are certainly present, and they tone down the peatiness a little bit, but are pleasingly balanced and in respect to a typical Kilchoman-dram.
The aftertaste is warm and round and pleasantly lingers on for quite a while.

I remember rating both the Sauterne and Madeira Cask finishes a full 4 stars, both being very fine drams. This Sherry finish certainly joins their spot with 4 stars.



(*) From every Single Malt bottle I purchase, I  pour one dram into a karaf until it's full, then I extract 5 drams into samples, until it's full again, and so on. The results vary of time, but it's a fun experiment"
