3.0,A light and fruity Speyside sherry-bomb.  Lots of floral and fruit tastes which are nicely layered.  Medium length aftertaste that brings out the oak.

3.0,"The sweet tastes and aroma of the sherry casks is nice upon the first initial tasting, however the after bite is incredibly rich and potent. Almost to the point of overpowering the drink in and of itself. I would recommend a few drops of water to release the better flavors"

4.0,"The Macallan is one of my Dad's old favourites and one of the first single malts I ever tasted (thanks to my Dad). Its smooth and mellow taste appealed to me and has pretty much determined my whiskey pallet to this day. A staple in my household that I'm comfortable with sharing with most people, even those who profess to not like whiskey, because this can start to change people's mind due to its smoothness."

4.0,"Golden straw, slightly green color. Not an intense nose - hints of vanilla and pastry dough, saw dust. Very, very smooth dram. More vanilla, pecan, butter, and lots of oak. Light on smoke factor. Finish is long enough to satisfy. For it to be aged in sherry barrels, I'm not getting that deep raisin sweetness that one can expect. This is not a complicated whiskey, but still satisfies my palate with its smoothness and oak factor. I actually like that there's no complex spice. Would like more smoke and a little peat though."

2.0,"Funny nose, funny palate, gentle finish. Did not like"
3.0,"Mine was actually the 12 year sherry oak. Day 23 of my 2017 advent. Sherry on the nose - fruity, but with Carmel undertones; Pleasant smell. Smooth, cool entry. No midpallet impression. Long finish with minimal heat. It’s kind of plums/grapes/apples on the finish.  Not too much though. Long pleasant aftertaste. It’s good. Not something I’d turn down, but not something I’d seek out either. I’d prefer something a little scotchier, less sherryish."

5.0,"@Richard-ModernDrinking and I had a tasting last night where we shared a few drams with each other.  This was the belle of the ball:  a 1980s Macallan 10.  Amazing aroma of dried fruits and nuts.  Taste was deeply complex, orange rinds and nuts.  Thick and oily, coating the mouth.  Out of the 12 I had last night, this ranked #1.  Thanks Richard for opening this !"
