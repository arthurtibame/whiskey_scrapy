3.75,"distilled in Sweden this dram was made with Optic barley which was peated to 45 ppm, and left to mature for 3 years in a single bourbon barrel. so that's the blurb bit. In terms of the taste as it is very interesting dram. You really do get to type of malted barley flavour that's different from the usual dram. You also get lovely sweetness from the barrel which blends beautifully with the peat. This all came through even at the 60 + % mark however I did add a bit of water to try and take the heat out of it. It does have a bit more of a kerosene e type flavour profile going on as well which I'm not sure if that's to do purely with the spirit itself but it is a bit of an odd one. I don't know personally if I would drink my way through a bottle but I did enjoy it for it's uniqueness."
