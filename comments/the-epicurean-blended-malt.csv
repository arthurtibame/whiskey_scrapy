2.75,"The Nose: overwhelming sweet red wine, after spending some time with it fresh cut grapefruit, and dark red grapes

The Pallet: slightly bitter and alcohol forward, delicate floral notes, butter, and some earthy notes. It feels very oily and creamy

The finish: slightly bitter lemon zest, and earth notes, medium length finish

My first experience with this blender and I hope to try more of their blends. unfortunately this one just isn't in my wheelhouse. It's good and I would definitely take it over your usual blended scotches."
4.25,"Nose: Dill flavor hits the nose initially with a buttery fragrance, delicate floral and grassy notes. Some lemon zest appears with green apple and a mild spearmint note at the back. Addition of water brings out a rich chocolate note and making th sugar much more apparent.

Palate: Cinnamon appears much more prominently with strong grassy notes, fennel, pears and apples. The spiciness lingers throughout giving way to a creamier flavor, vanilla and soft herbs, almost like a mint tea. Adding water opens up fruitier notes of green grapes and slight hints of banana with milk chocolate

Finish: A long-lasting combination of lemongrass, fennel and subtle oak."

2.75,"On nose: herbs, fresh, some grain.
Palate: light, then herbal spices. With some water herbal stuff transforms to more peppery notes.
Aftertaste: some oaky bitterness, herbal spices.
After sitting in the glass for a while, it got to be less harsh, bit better for me."
3.75,"I will be reviewing all of the core expression of Douglas Laing Blended Whiskies, absolutely the most fun and good looking bottles in the market. I'll start with the most simple one: the epicurean. 

The story about this epicurean guy that is shown in the bottle is that he was a 1930 person who like the best of food and drinks. 

This is a blend from lowland malts... pretty interesting.

Bottled at 46.2%abv.

On the nose: Dry orange cake. Chantilly cream. Raisins. Tobacco. 

On the palate: very bitter, tobbaco notes and some citric lime notes. Finish medium long, with a very pleasant ginger note. 

Overall i give this dram a 78 over 100, it is an easy drink even for 46.2%abv. I Love the bottle. Slainte!"

3.5,"Light smoke on the nose, citrus to grapefruit a little vanilla.  Very light color.  Taste light smoke, sweet, notes of grass, vanilla and caramel.  Not comlex, light on the tongue.  A decent blended scotch."

3.0,"Простоват.  Оооочень мало цветов, мало фруктов, мало медовых и слатких нот, но много мягкости. Наверное этим и вытягивает. А так , в общем и целом, сэм и сэм.  Мало Лоулэнда. На 3,0."
