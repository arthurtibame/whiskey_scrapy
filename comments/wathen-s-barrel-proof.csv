4.25,"Really different.  Nose of chocolate and leather.  1st sip very hot at 62% but as the ice melts it opens a lot!  Remains chocolatey with a long, dusty finish.  I couldn’t quite place it at first but hit me that it was like unsweetened hot chocolate powder dustiness.  Last sip better than the rest.  Really unique and definitely one I will try to always have on the shelf!"
3.75,"Nose - Floral and fruity, you can tell it’s definitely aged, sweet tones

Palate - musky, pepper, mild sweetness and even hints of banana. Water opens this thing up on a heat factor

Aftertaste - Very smooth which reflects the age, earthy tones


I can appreciate the taste but for roughly $100 there’s better choices out there"
4.0,Sweet nose but very hot flavor

3.75,"Spoonful of black peppercorns, crushed candy canes, Bartlett pear skins, spent matchsticks, and a spiced rum-coconut undertone. Pretty good medley of flavors, and a nice mule kick at 117.4 proof!"
