5.0,"Perfect for someone who is looking for a way to get into brown spirits. For me I like to substitute it into cocktails in place of a traditional bourbon. Makes an amazing Old Fashioned with great depth of flavor, and you can skip adding the sugar cube. Also makes an amazing mint julep. Because it has only natural ingredients you don't get the fake notes of other ""flavored"" whiskeys. No fake sugar notes either - just pure, real taste. The perfect addition to BBQ sauce, as well. My wife thanked me for introducing BSB to her - now she can enjoy a glass of whiskey with me!"
2.5,"We call it “crack”! It’s totally off-the-charts sweet so it’s not really a typical bourbon. We keep it frozen and use it over ice cream, or just have some straight for dessert."

3.0,"Good on it’s own, or mixed with lemonade or twisted tea. Heavy on the brown sugar with just hint on cinnamon."
