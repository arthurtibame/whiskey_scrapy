4.0,"Color: Sunlight through Golden Grasses of Grain
Nose: Green apples, grapes, heather, and with deep inhale, baking spice in the back of the throat
Palate: Sweet creamy vanilla, honey comb cereal, oak tannins in the back with cinnamon nipping at your tonsils, if you still have them. Grass, leather, and smoke are present throughout.
Finish: Long, warming, and inviting with pepper, cinnamon, citrus, and cardamom. 
Balance: It lives up to its name. Truly a great harmony of diverse yet complimentary flavors. It’s dangerous as the high ABV is not felt nor smelt. It did not require water though I will add 2 drops to the bottom of the dram and see what happens.
Water: Nose became more floral, Rose, Geranium, African Violet. Palate:Complex, as water seems to enhance the fire on the tongue. Creamy cinnamon candy ice cream, with vegetal aftertaste, converging the sweet floral notes on the nose to more savory baking spice, oak tannins, and smoky leather. Finish: Just as long, salivating all the way.
Overall: 4/5 this is an uncorking so the spirit can change with some time below the shoulder. I’ll report back if it does. Regardless, a truly enjoyable dram with a lot of layers and flavors. A deck it’s rebuy."
