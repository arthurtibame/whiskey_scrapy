4.0,"After a tasting at the Tom's Town Distillery in Kansas City, I purchased a 750 for $50. I've come to enjoy this pour a lot. Light, but lively, this is an Indiana-sourced bourbon, with an age of at least 8 years, I'm told, although they have started to distill and age their own whiskey. The time spent in port casks gives it a nice floral note to round off the spice. If you're in the Midwest, look this one up. 85/100"

3.5,"Smells of oak and vanilla. Taste is caramel, oak, and apricot. Full. Long finish"
4.75,Sweet and very smooth. The port aging helps smooth out the rough edges and leaves something very complex and definitely delicious. Compares in my mind to Angel's Envy.
