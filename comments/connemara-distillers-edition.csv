3.5,Smokey and spicy...an absolute deviation from the Irish whiskey norm. Add two drops of water to thoroughly release the aroma in the glass. Definitely one to add to your collection!
2.75,"N- medicinal and malty, opening up into a citrus and eucalyptus note that fades into honeysuckle and orange blossom with hints of iodine campfire. 

P- medicinal cough syrup with light smoke, citrus and fruit mid palate

F- soft short malty finish with very subtle peppery. 

Overall an acceptable pour but nothing special. This is an average daily drinker if peaty Irish is your thing."
