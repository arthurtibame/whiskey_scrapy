2.25,"This is one of Lidl’s own brand whisky range.  The first impression is that it is very light and that it tastes young and sweet.  As it develops it maintains the sweet but adds a lemon/lime bitterness and a light oak that stays with you.

Overall, it’s a decent dram for the money.  It’s pretty cheap, it’s light and easy to drink and it’s better than a lot of whiskies in the same price band.  I wouldn’t run out to buy a bottle, but it’s unassuming and not too bad."
