4.0,"On the nose this spirit hangs in there with the Islay masters. Unfortunately, the experience is too fleeting after the first tipple, confirming this peat addict's apprehensions of maturity. Also, the Oloroso influence requires too much concentration to be easily enjoyed. I'm sure ten more years of the angel's siphoning will make this young distillery's whiskies truly great. I'm already marking my calendar.  :)"

Everything just comes together in the right way, so compliments to their master blender at vatting this whisky to perfection. The peat and smoke married to lemon peels and a touch of brine are simply outstanding, with a body that is full as oily. And with a finish that lingers, I have to be honest with myself and admit that the only reason I'm not awarding this dram five stars is because of my prejudice against this distillery."

4.0,"I purchased this almost a year ago and have not been able to get to this until recently.  The Machir Bay was eye opening as to what Kilchomann can do, especially being so relatively young.  With the same roots as it's brethren, the influence of an Oloroso sherry cask proves to be curious comparison.

A opening on the nose is sweet and maritime salty.  The smoke is there, but it duck and dodges.  The combination of sweet, salt and smoke is somewhat akin to a smoked glazed ham.  Over a fair amount of time, the tropical fruity notes; an ambrosia: marshmallows, pineapples, coconuts.

Rich, smokey, spicy, earthy and sweet.  That is the rush of flavors and textures on the palate in the initial first sip.  Cigar, brown sugar and caramel are the primary flavors.  Trace amounts of wood/oak keep the palate slightly dry.  Drawing more sips over time, black pepper/lemon pepper spice and bittersweet dark chocolate blend amongst the other flavors.  Still, though, the youngness can be detected, but it's not so obvious.

Finally, you are left with a long finish that is drying, along the lines of a red wine with cigar ash and the bitterness of orange and chocolate.

This is a warming sipper perfect for those damp, cool, autmun days.  Smoke plays a supplemental role to the flavors around it.  A touch of youngness is revealed but almost in the afterthought.  A bit more time and age and this may be a powerhouse amongst the likes of Lagavulin, Ardbeg or Laphroaig.  [$62][90/100][Tasted: 9/30/17]"
4.0,"Scotland, September 2017. Whisky #9

Nose: Smoky, oily fruit (grapefruit, peaches, lime), some brine.

Palate: Smooth, rich and smoky. Fruity, but heavier than the nose - prunes and stewed fruit. Sherry, but subtle. An overall sweetness that is just right.

Finish: Long. Chocolate, fruit and gentle smoke that lingers enticingly, beckoning you back for another dram.

In my opinion this is the best Kilchoman expression to date and the first I've tasted that did not seem immediately too young. The citrus note can be a bit over-emphasized in their whisky for my taste, but here it is perfectly contained and balanced by the sherry cask influence. Great whisky with a really masterful finish. Good value for money.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

4.0,"So, after many delays and unforeseen issues, I have finally finished the 30th sample from me and my friend's second round of scotch samples.  It's a good thing, too, as our third round of samples is supposed to ship next week.  I saved this one for last because it represented what I hoped would be one of the best of the round, and possibly one of the best of the entire tour for me.  This is the NAS, peated whisky from Kilchoman.  The 2016 Sanaig comes in at 46% ABV, has no color added and is non-chill filtered.  It was supplied on the tour by Scott from Long Island, NY.

I was also able to sample this along with their other NAS juice, Machir Bay.  The bulk of the Sanaig was finished in Oloroso sherry casks while the Machir was left in American oak.  So, this one should have and was significantly sweeter.  Sweet and peat work much better IMO, so I expected a lot from this one.  It delivered.

It's a bright, golden yellow in the taster and produces thicker, sticky legs on the glass when you spin it, while releasing a pleasant aroma of tropical fruits, sweet toffee and BBQ-esque smoke.  When you dive in closer the earthy elements of peat and sea salt provide that strong, island backbone.  They meld together quite well and create a wonderful nosing experience similar to Lagavulin and Highland Park.

The palate is surprisingly luscious:  more tropical and orchard fruits, plums and sweet raisins along with a healthy dose of chocolate coat the tongue until the smoky peat and warming alcohol settle in and let you know you're sipping whisky from the Scottish isles.  The slightly higher ABV is actually the saving grace here because it really comes in at the perfect time to push away the sweetness.  There's a bit of harsh pepper and oak here that give a hint to the fact this stuff is somewhat youthful, but it's not overpowering nor is it offensive.  It just reminds you that you are drinking younger stock.  I've had a few reservations about NAS whisky since the market is becoming somewhat flooded with them, but this is one of the better ones.

The finish is all Island whisky:  earthy peat, brine and smoke that's long and warming.  I pick up the chocolate again here, too.  That's the scariest part of this one because it makes you want to drink more.  It could easily turn a night time dram into a late night session, lol.

Overall, what excites me the most is that Kilchoman clearly has some great master blenders at their disposal and they are making quality stuff this early in their career.  I wish I had a time machine and could travel forward about 15 years to taste some of their aged and blended stock.  I have a feeling they will become one of the big dogs on not just Islay, but in all of Scotland.  They haven't reached Ardbeg or Lagavulin status, but they are well on their way.  Buy and try with confidence, guys.  This is solid single malt Scotch.  4.25 stars.  Cheers, my friends."

4.0,"Yum! A great dash of peat to go along with the oloroso sherry cask on the nose.  I also get deep, strong tea, orange marmalade and smoke. On the palate I get a sweet orange gumdrop, cayenne pepper, subtle dark chocolate, and maple syrup.  I don’t see how one couldn’t enjoy this dram because you get a fantastic balance of the combination of peat, sweet, spice, and bitter notes.  The finish is medium in length with a mouth coat of oil, brine, and sugar.  4.0.  The theme of this dram should be something dark but spicy, maybe “Somos Mas Americanos” by Los Tigres Del Norte. Damn, my ancestors are Scots Irish/French, but I might have to bust out my Bajo Quinto."

4.0,"Stop number 30 (and the final stop of round two) of the SDT is Kilchoman. Sanaig is one in Kilchoman's core range of expressions. 46% ABV, and like all Kilchoman whiskies, it is natural color and non chill filtered. This one is an amber gold in color. 

Rich soft peat on the nose. Less intense than the Machir Bay. Grilled apricots and peaches, unexpected but quite pleasant. Lemongrass, a little lime and oranges. Sherry sweetness, raisins, dates and plums. No real oak to speak of, but a sawdust sensation is there. Caramel and burnt sugar and a touch of dark chocolate. More like a Lagavulin than a Laphroaig. After time in the glass I got a distinct mocha note followed by maple syrup. 

The palate has more peat than the nose indicated. Meaty. Bonfire and cigar ashes. Cocoa dusted oranges, mocha and pepper. A little salted caramel to round it all out. It has a youthful zip but shows maturity beyond its years. On the verge of true elegance. 

A medium bodied mouthfeel that is dry. 
The finish is long and rich. Peat smoke and dark sherry/mocha. 

This is like the fraternal twin of Machir Bay. Born together but distinct personalities. This is comprised of both sherry and bourbon maturation, but mostly sherry. The Machir Bay is the opposite. The Oloroso casks really mellowed out the young spirit. I would buy a full bottle even at $5-10 more than its brother. I would prefer to wait until it had a few more years of maturation to it as I feel it could be something amazing. Another 10 years in sherry casks and then maybe finishing in virgin American oak could do wonders. Thanks to Scott for the sample. Looking forward to round 3 and all the wonderful samples therein. Solid 4
Cheers"
4.0,"Named after a rocky inlet in the northwest of Islay, Kilchoman Sanaig is the distillery's second NAS core range bottling beside 'Machir Bay'. What a flattering nose! Cooked fruits, cloves and bonfire smoke harmonize with toffee, marshmallows and hints of salt. After a mouth-watering and warming arrival, the sherry cask influence becomes more prominent. Imagine peaty sweetness, wood tannins, brine and lemon zest, lingering on the palate for endless minutes. Almost reminiscent of Lagavulin DE, this young Single Malt scores with quality and character.

RATING: 3.9/5.0 stars ≙ 86 pts → FIRST-CLASS [-]"

4.0,"This was Scot's contribution as part of our Scottish sampling team.   I'm constantly amazed as to how well Kilchoman produces really good whisky; I guess it's not a new comer anymore, being that it's 10 years old.  But, relatively speaking, it's still a young distillery.  I also think it a full farm to bottle operation, if I'm not mistaken.  Grown on Islay, fermented, distilled, and bottled there.  NCF and no-coloring too, which is a bonus.  The aromas and flavor remind me of a young Lagavulin.  Burnt rubber, briny, salty peat, and enough citrus backbone to keep it all tied together.   Last year's Loch Gorm blew me away, and this is almost up there as well.   Thanks Scott."

4.25,"Cracking open the sample on this one and giving it a nose definitely reminded me of lagavullin 16 which i haven't had in a while. The similarities translate to the palate, a cross between the laga and a bowmore 18 in some ways in terms of flavour profile but thinner and younger. No harshness though. I'm really impressed with this drop given its only 5ish years old. My favourite Kilchoman so far. The distillery founders Anthony and Kathy wills will be attending the NZ dramfest in March next year so I'll make sure to pop along to the special session they are running and sample all their top notch stuff :-). 4.25 at least for this one."

Peat. A lot of peat, and smoke. Salt, peppery spices, and some citrus fruits, and some dark chocolate. Similar to the Machir Bay, but the added hint of fruity sweetness by the Oloroso finish is definately a plus!"

4.0,"Feis Ile 2018 sample review, tasted alongside a host of other Kilchoman expressions, including some uncommon ones not on the site (Sauternes, PX distillery exclusive).  Sanaig and Loch Gorm are two of Kilchoman's expressions that feature significant sherry influence, and the differences between the two were undoubtedly subtle.  This is a classic, dry Islay nose of brine and smoked seafood. 
       The palate has mild, malty, caramel sweetness complemented by rich hookah smoke.  The finish is a bit hot and spicy at first, and lingers for a while with smoke and vegetal flavors.  Loch Gorm gives a similar experience but at a higher price point, so I'd recommend Sanaig first."

NAS

Nose: Laphroaig-style medicinal, phenolic, tarry peat smoke with some sweet fruit notes like plum and cherry. There are also hints cocoa, and vanilla and cinnamon from the bourbon cask.

Taste: Oily, medium bodied and slightly acidic. Thick smoke; orange-citrus; cinnamon spice; dark fruit; hint of caramel and sea salt. It goes by fairly quickly and doesn't have too much depth.

Finish: medium, with pepper, salt, and some darker fruit and berry notes from the Oloroso sherry maturation (chocolate-covered raisin, dark cherry) along with smokiness and barrel char. 

Value: $60-70 USD. Solid price.

Final thoughts: a young whisky to be sure. I'm a big fan of peated single malts with sherry finishes, and I think this one, with a few more years on it, will be a stunner. It's good but not quite there yet; still though, this dram nothing to sneeze at as it offers some complexities.

Score: 3.5/5. Recommend trying or buying at a good price.

H/t to @LeeEvolved for the generous sample!"

3.75,"This is a second taste of the Sanaig, but from a batch bottled in 2017.  I didn’t see the need to create another entry because Kilchoman isn’t trying to capitalize on separate vintages.  I also have an earlier review of the 2016 if you search this particular bottle further down in the reviews.

Kilchoman is one of Islay’s newer upstarts and they are starting to have plenty of aged stock to hit the market, but they are still releasing quality NAS stuff, like this Sanaig.  This gets its name from a nearby stream on the western side of Islay.  This is primarily ex-sherry matured whisky, with this 2017 bottling adding a bit of ex-bourbon cask aged juice.  It’s bottled at 46% and I overpaid a bit for this bottle ($78) as I bought it while on a golf trip to Myrtle Beach, SC back in February of this year.

The appearance is a deep gold and there are lots of undefined, oily legs and tiny beads left behind after a thorough spin.  The nose is heavily sherried smoke and stewed berries.  There’s light citrus and rich caramel mingling around if you dig deep enough.  The smoke, sherry and light sea notes carry the bulk of the load here.  More ex-bourbon whisky would’ve easily added extra layers and depth here, but I’m not complaining.

The palate brings smoke, earthy peat and toffee followed by the aforementioned vanilla and barrel notes.  It’s very smooth and warming, bottled perfectly at 46% ABV in my opinion, and there’s a lingering orange and tangerine note left behind after the midsip and swallow.

The finish is medium, tending towards long, with smoky BBQ’d meats.  It’s oily and mouth and throat coating with a nice grape-y sherry sweetness.

Overall, I had a sample of the 2016 batch awhile back and thoroughly enjoyed it- awarding it 4 stars and proclaiming big things for Kilchoman and their early NAS lines.  This batch seemed a bit toned down and lacked as much depth as the 2016, but it’s still a fantastic dram.  If you can find a bottle of either vintage at a reasonable price you won’t be disappointed.  This one sits comfortably at 3.75-4 stars.  Buy and enjoy with confidence, my friends.  Cheers."

4.0,"Of an inviting golden color (100% natural), the sherried influence on the nose is immediately perceived in the ripe fruit arm in arm with vanilla, with a very subtle and elegant peated layer. To let it breathe (do not be greedy and wait a little, come on!), there is also a pinch of medicine, and the peaty side seems more herbaceous than scorched. Overall full and pleasant aroma, without any invasiveness from the alcohol.
In fact, now that it can finally be drunk, the alcohol is still dome, and instead comes a discreet component of orange to add to the same fruity and herbaceous scents of the sense of smell, with smoking more present than on the nose. Still the medicinal note, but more saline, with the delicious island oceanic component. The sweetness of the sherry does not elbow and is forced to coexist with the other aromas, so much so that at times you can even perceive a bitterish tip. Not exactly very balanced, perhaps too young to be more compact and coherent, but drinking on the whole is pleasant, and leaves in the final peat and salinity to accompany the memory for a fairly long time."

Off the top, it's all leather, brine and oil on the nose. There isn't as much smoky char as other peated drams. This leans towards the seaweed and petroleum end of the spectrum.

But on the palate this thing comes bursting with salt, fish, pepper, and then the sherry cask shines through with berries, dried apricot, cocoa and coffee, then the more subtle presence of black pepper and char lingers for a long time. 

This is outstanding, bringing the peat and the sweet and have them battle for your enjoyment."

So here we are over the last weekend at a gas station and my little one wants a slushy. We enter the gas station purchase said slushy when I notice a pretty robust Whisky selection. I see this one tucked away! You just never know where you will find a nice Whisky for a decent price! Let's move to the tasting:
Rich and oily mouthfeel with smoldering smoke leading to toffee apple, poached pears and and underlying fudge note. Lovely sweet and smokey entry. Mid palette adds  baking spices and orange peel. Finish is long with more smoke and the arrival of red fruits and some more caramel. 
This really is a lovely sweet and smokey Islay experience. Very different to others I have had but in a really good way. I think I am officially a Kilchoman fan!

4.0,"Kilchoman Masterclass at The Oak Barrel, Sydney, June 25th 2019: Whisky #2

Nose: You can sense the same distillery character as in Kilchoman's Machir Bay and Islay Barley expressions, but here the cereal and citrus notes are swapped out for deeper stewed fruit aromas and spices. The level of peat is identical to Machir Bay but the cask influence gives this whisky a richer and more full-bodied character. There’s a slight seaweed note but it is dusky and mellow - a gust of beach bonfire smoke carrying a hint of brine and honey-cured bacon.

Palate: A measured and full smoky arrival with stewed fruit (prunes, apricots). The distillery’s characteristic spice note is apparent in the development, but it's rounded and mild here with a complex palette of warm spices in evidence. The peat-smoke, which has a very nice leather, chocolate and tobacco quality, is pervasive and the texture is just to the oily side of neutral.

Finish: Medium. The palate rolls away smoothly leaving a well-balanced aftertaste with recurring wafts of smoke.

Sanaig showcases fragrant peat-smoke, the estery fruitiness of a long fermentation, fresh bourbon barrels and robust oloroso sherry casks and is one of Kilchoman’s best products - arguably the star of their core range. It's very good neat, but just a dash of water does it no harm at all. Unlike the Machir Bay and Islay Barley expressions where water smooths the edges and creates balance, in this case it melds the palate together and makes the whisky ""bloom"".

Interestingly, it is the same new-make as Machir Bay and only differs with regard to the casks used for maturation.  In the case of Machir Bay, Kilchoman use 90% ex-bourbon/10% ex-sherry whereas here the combination is 70% ex-sherry/30% ex-bourbon.  They also exclusively use wet casks and only do refills once, so the cask influence is always fresh and vigorous.

I previously reviewed this two years ago based on the 2016 release. I'm putting this review here as well because Sanaig is a consistent and well-balanced NAS that has so far showed minimal batch variation. This bottling is maybe just a shade less impressive than the inaugural batch, but it's still worth 4 stars.

[Sanaig was originally only available in France as a special release but is now part of the core range. It would make sense for Distiller to just remove the ""2016"" from the listing and make this the generic entry for Sanaig].

“Very Good” : 4 stars"

3.75,"Nose is very peaty and smoky as expected. Also with creamy chocolate, vanilla and raisins.

On palate it feels stronger than 46%, the milk chocolate is more apparent with even a bit of coffee. 

The finish is long and sweet with the chocolate flavours, with some rounded peat."

3.25,"The initial nose is slightly sulfuric, and also reminds me of a Campbeltown.  The palate plays between smoke and  sherry sweetness, while not becoming savory.  Subsequent tastes reveal typical sherry notes, as the smoke takes a back seat.  A half-teaspoon of water highlights these notes, while not really taming the smoke.  Finish is peppery, beef jerky.  Subsequent oxidation changes the balance between smoke and sherry, to round it out into a savory character (but not quite meaty).

3.75,"not too much sherry flavour, peaty"
4.25,"Surprised they even had this in Louisiana, much less out in the country where I found it. Thankfully it didn’t scan and got it for a good price. Glad I did!

Nose: Bright fruits like apples, some salt, a strange creamy note, with peat smoke underpinning the whole affair. The sherry cask doesn’t turn dark or savory since it’s so young.

Palate: The peat takes center stage, though not on the level of Ardbeg or the like. The fruit, salt, and cream (must be the malt) mix really well here and fight off the smoke, which is a little spiky. That might read like a flaw, but I love it. The peat was more dominant when the bottle was first opened.

Finish: Medium finish, with the sherry and peat sticking around. Not viscous but pretty oily, which I prefer.

Great stuff. Would gladly pay up to $70 for it. And notably I think it’s more enjoyable than the Uigeadail."

3.75,"Compared to the Machir Bay which I prefer more, this one on the nose smells like your typical Islay, that familiar hint of the smoke and ash that you anticipate when you take a taste. However the smoke on this one is blunted somewhat, muted strangely by a taste you would get in bourbon. This is one of the few Islay whiskeys I've had that fake you out, you think you're drinking Islay Scotch on the nose, but the taste quickly takes you to a bourbon, strange I know. I like it, I don't regret buying a bottle, but like it enough to buy another bottle? No. If I were to buy another bottle, it be Machir Bay."

4.0,"In honor of World Whisky Day instead of going all out with something I know is amazing, I decided to give two distilleries a second attempt that didn’t convince me in the first place. Namingly Wolfburn first and Kilchoman on the second dram. From both I had samples before but they just didn’t click with me. So here we go. 

The sample I have here is the Sanaig Dark Batch which is basically the same as the regular one but (compared to pictures I found ) it is way darker. It has a hazelnut red-brown color. 

Nose: Uhhh - very pleasant peat that comes along smooth and almost warm-feeling. It is thick and full and very creamy. Underneath the peat there is brown nuts, fresh pie, herbal and sweet cough juice, mixed dried fruits (“energy balls” without chocolate), unripe sour black berry, smoked salty fatty food, a little bid of rubber and salty licorice as well. This is actually the first whisky I had that is literally mouth-watering. That maybe just situational but hey - it’s the first time I noticed that in a whisky tasting, so I thought it is worth mentioning. 

Palate: peat, smoke, saltiness and a enveloping caramelly sweetness. This is nice - really nice. It is like dipping a maple-syrup cured fried bacon in ginger-apple compote that has some chili bits in it. It becomes more sweet and fruity over time. 

What a lovely dram. Even my girlfriend who doesn’t drink whisky liked a sip I shared with her. What a step-up from that special Netherlands release I had some time ago that I didn’t like. I think I will try to get a sample of the Loch Gorm you guys seem to like as well and then decide on which one goes onto my shelf. Such a nice, rich, deep and intense relaxing evening dram."

5.0,"I have almost completed tasting at least one from every Islay's distilleries. Kilchoman was present in Whisky live and they where showing the Machir Bay (which i have a bottle unopened) and Sanaig, an awesome, yet classic in style, islay expression.

Bottled at 46%abv

On the nose: the world famous fresh can of Tennis balls note. Wonderful. A very well crafted Grape note on the back of the dram, and that plastic used in the making of Water balloons. Instant marvel.

On the palate, wow it is super smooth. The peaty note resembles....Sweat socks????, Cotton or fabric, Super interesting. Pepper slightly peated on the finished. super balanced. What a dram this is!

Overall.... you know.... 100 over 100. I dont think this is expensive, you go buy it, NOW! SLAINTE!"
4.25,"Really enjoy this. The sherry, salt and spice are exceptionally well balanced. Some burnt caramel and raisins in the aftertaste. The peat and smoke come in and out and wrestle the dark fruits and date from the sherry cask. I’m looking forward to see how this opens up as it oxidizes. It did well in the glass. Recommend letting it breathe for a bit to smooth out the spice and let the more subtle flavors come in. 

Will update with a few drops of water next time. Just wanted to enjoy a few drams neat this time."

4.0,This one is just full of surprises. On the nose you get a vanilla like profile with some small hints of a fruity tang. Down the hatch it does bite a bit but surprisingly emits aromas of grapes with a long finish that has that signature iodine that lasts for a very long time. Definitely an islay malt in every way.
