4.75,"Nose: berries, berries, oh and more berries. Not as distinct as pappy but very good. Maybe a bit of vanilla cake in there

Palate: holy cow. A thick berry bomb rushes over immediately. I was very shocked. It’s then swallowed by the vanilla that was on the nose. Two distinct flavors make this bourbon extremely unique and so very good. 

Finish: the vanilla sits on the palate all the way through the end. I love this."
4.25,Very smooth and oaky.

4.25,"Its best qualities are up front. Sweet nose, vanilla, dark fruit (grapes, plum?), and Bubblicious gum. The palate continues largely in the same sweet vein, with a bit of cherry cola added to the mix. The finish veers off in a completely different direction. Dry oak, spice. It’s an interesting sip. Quite good, even though I don’t love the note it exits on. And I know this is the 2018 bottling but if it’s similar to 2017, I don’t see a path to whiskey of the year."

4.5,"750ml bottle poured neat in Glencairn at The Partisan in DC.  Vanilla, spice, grains, hay, cherries. Lasting complex finish, lingering spice with touch of heat.  Beautiful.  At $14 a pour in an upscale DC establishment, this was a true steal.  Love this.  7/3/19"

4.5,Cherry Vanilla Caramel with a spicy and long finish. Not worth secondary/online prices currently but at retail this is a great buy and there is a reason it is highly sought after.

5.0,"Nose just smells smooth with notes of oats. Palate is smooth and very complex with notes of flowers, blueberries, and oats. Finish is long and tangy."
