4.5,"Sweet tropical notes and peaches hit you initially on the nose and then it opens up to sweet cloves (if you can imagine that). 

The palate is oily and rich and very smooth for the ABV. 

The finish is warming and lingers in the best way. 

This stuff is great!!!"
4.0,A burning mouthful of amazing flavours tropical fruit and caramel! Was sipping it slowly and watering it down here and there and then tried an old fashioned with it Wow it was amazing so much depth maybe my fave old fashioned did water it to maybe 40-50% for it
4.25,"Whoa!  This one comes loud and fast. I get a ton of tropical fruits on the nose. Papayas, pineapples, coconut. Then there is a nice vanilla and even some bubble gum. There’s a little bit of rye spice, but I find I have to really dig for it. This nose is fruity and fresh. On the palate, vanilla, dark caramel, that rye liquorice, and a building heat. The finish is warm. Cinnamon hearts, then some of that bubble gum and fruit comes back.  Nice stuff and a great price. Will definitely pick up another bottle"
