4.5,"I FREAKING LOVE THIS WHISKY. As soon as i tasted it for the first time i knew i will have a long time relationship with this one. It is so gentle in the palate and so delicious that you can drink it like water. 

It has been matured for 13 years in european oloroso sherry seasoned butts. 

Bottled at 40%abv, Red color. As in any strawberry Jam.

On the nose: Maraschino Cherries, full of it. Bacon, glazed pork and GRENADINE SYRUP. It is the sweetest most cloying thing in the world. Since i am a fat guy, this is great. Lol

On the palate, AMAZINGLY SWEET. Red fruits, cherries, marmalade and smooth sweet sherry. Nothing complex but plainly delicious. 

Aftertaste is mostly sherried with hints of ginger spice. Easy drinkable. 

Overall i would buy a container of this and i could drink it till the end of times. The most sweet and easy going sherriness ever. It is a dessert made whisky. Many won't share my score, but i just loved it. 92 over 100. SLAINTE MHATH FRIENDS!"
