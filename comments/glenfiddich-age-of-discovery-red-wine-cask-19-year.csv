4.0,"Right it's been a busy week on the whiskey front. After several segways I'm back on my 100 step programme...no. 2 of my sample set...the AA programme comes to mind when I hear about alcohol and steps being associated but my programme has many more steps and the 12th one definitely won't involve me being sober! Anyhow to the whiskey. Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon casks are used on this one.Do I like it..yes..is it my favourite Glenfiddich to date definitely (although that's a low bar). As Cask Strength Joe said ""where is the wine""? Then eventually after drinking with food (maybe it's the satay sauce?) I finally get the wine hit..I often forget that whiskey like wine often needs a bit of food to help the palate get the flavour to come through. I was about to say I definitely see it come through in the colour as well but there it goes.. caramel colouring...and why the hell would you chill filter such an expensive whiskey. Bit of spice, slight grapefruit bitterness, oak, toffee, plum. Hmm rating is hard.. this is a $120USD whisky. Is it worth it? Well I sure wouldn't pay it. I think 4 on merit... value for money drags it down to 3.5. I'll leave it at 4...but just"

4.0,"Great whisky, but where's the red wine? I was not expecting something this floral and herbaceous, with a touch of smoke. The additional notes of vanilla and honey really made this one a pleasure to enjoy, but again... where's the red wine?"
4.25,"Spicy and rich, with notes of Apple brandy, caramel, and mildly toasted grain.  Very subtle smoke on the finish."
3.5,"Personally, the aging in Red wine casks didn't do it for me. The tastes i found were hard to point. On the nose, there was a bit of red wine, which was completely gone while tasting. Personally, this is placed 3 out of 3 in the Age of Discovery collection"
