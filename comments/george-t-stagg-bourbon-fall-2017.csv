4.0,"PRICE: $100-150 retail.  You won’t find it at this price unless you’re a bourbon hunter and know what you’re doing.  Secondary pricing is $500-800, although this is decreasing because this year’s yield was humongous (almost 40,000 bottles).
INFO: 15 year old Kentucky Bourbon distilled and bottled by Buffalo Trace.  The mashbill is 75% corn, 10% rye, and 15% malted barley.  This 2017 edition is bottled at 64.6% ABV

NOSE: 82/100.  Secretive, and deceptively subdued on the nose.  Disappointingly, no amount of water seems to really release it.  It opens with time.  Order this one with your dinner, finish your dinner, and it might be ready to smell by then.  Cherries, oak, and brown sugar.  Really, I expected more.

PALATE: 88/100.  If George Foreman were a bourbon… this does not float like a butterfly, nor sting like a bee; this throws one-ton haymakers like a bear.  Cherries and raisins.  Tongue-numbing alcoholic bite with wood and rye spices.  Resinous syrupy mouthfeel.  This is a powerful, but straightforward bourbon with classic, concentrated bourbon flavors.  Water softens things up, but not add any complexity.

FINISH: 91/100.  Very nice.  Dries the throat and warms the chest.  Cigars and tannins.  A leathery oakiness.  The 15 years of age shines through.

OVERALL: I definitely prefer Buffalo Trace’s wheated bourbons: WLW and Pappy.  This is a sharp, almost overwhelming dram that forces you to take in slowly.  It commands your attention by brute force, but not necessarily elegance or complexity.

MARK: 87/100
VALUE FOR MONEY: Over twice the number of GTS bottles were released this year compared to last year.  Hopefully, this overwhelms the unscrupulous buyers who try to mark up the price 5-10 times, and you can actually find some bottles at retail.  It’s worth it at retail; I wouldn’t pay more."

5.0,"Not easy to find Buffalo Trace Antique Collection bottles, and even harder to find them for a decent price.  Thankfully, Mandarin Hide in St. Petersburg (Fla.) is operating like a charity for whiskey lovers at the moment, so we got two pours of this beautiful bourbon for $16 a drink.  Compared to the last George T. Stagg I enjoyed, the 2013 version, this bourbon seemed less intense, despite the almost identical ABV and aging.  Its nose is distinctive and exhibits the dried fruit and chocolate character that I associate with Buffalo Trace.  This year's version is reminiscent of chocolate-covered raisins, with a rich backdrop of luxurious leather.  Each sip is more delicious than the last, exhibiting apricot, raisin, chocolate, and caramel in equal measure.  The finish has a pop of rye spice and a long, spicy, dry, oak coda.  Another lovely bourbon, although I wouldn't kill myself to find a bottle."

Not an every day sipper but great for a special occasion. I wouldn’t pay $200+ for it. I (as a newbie) don’t get much more from this than from Stagg Jr."

4.75,"This bottle showed up at a recent party and I was fortunate to get a nice taste, the owner was saving it for a tasting event so we only had a couple of shots to judge on but so be it. 
            
            This was the first ""tall"" Stagg(not junior) I've gotten to sample, so my expectation wasn't remarkable based on what Junior both is and ISN'T.  Like the baby-daddy it is 127ish proof and not for the faint of heart as this may be too powerful for an immature drinkers palate. 
            
            The nose was quite familiar, ""junior like"" but brings an additional array of sugars, a Booker-like richness that is missing in the short bottle (jr). 
            
            Very warm up front, heat that is ""in your face""(literally) but still surprisingly smooth and absent of harshness, again reminded of the best characteristics of junior without some of the overbearing wallop to the nose you get with the short bottle.   Daddy is smooth!  On the tongue, George T Stagg is heavy.  This is where you really start noting the amazing difference in the George T over the Junior label, the flavor profile has a big beefy middle of sugars, (deep woods, vanilla, aged red fruit) like something Fred Noe himself would keep tucked away from strangers.    The richness of often missing notes in the short bottle are all filled in here, present and accounted for, slight variations of fruit and spices linger into the finish and the heat slowly dissipates allowing for a much anticipated followup sip.  I sprinkled a thimble of water in my mini glencairn for the  2nd round and found it did ""break open"" the weight of the rich middle to reveal some hidden spice notes.  

I expected better than Stagg Jr, but I didn't expect THIS KIND of better. Fantastically good, just amazing, it's everything you wanted but isn't in Stagg Jr. making for one of the best bourbons of the year.   If this isn't a 5 star bourbon then THERE ARE NO 5 star bourbons on the market today.
            
            I believe it sold at well  over 200$.  Given the rarity of BTACs you won't stumble over this on the street anywhere, but if you can find a way to try this or snag a bottle.. DO IT!  For the true bourbon connoisseur, you won't regret!"

Amazingly the bottle on offer was only half empty after a couple of hours, so maybe people didn't spot it in their clamour for more mainstream stuff. Hard to write a fair assessment on the basis of a stand-up shot in a noisy room, as appreciating this clearly takes time and contemplation, so don't put too much stock in my rating. Instead, just take my advice to keep your eyes peeled at whisky festivals for bottles tucked slightly out of sight."

Palate is rich, it starts off with a sharp fruity sting, then cascades with waves of smoky goodness. Cinnamon, char, brown sugar, saltes caramel, apple cider, nutmeg, smoked meat. Great hug, this isn't as hot as I expected, but it's definitely warm going down. Dark chocolate lingers. This doesn't feel thin, but it's thinner than I expected, for some reason. Small quibble. This is really good. I've read some reviews that say this was a down year for Stagg; I wouldn't know, but if this is down, then the other years must be crazy good. 5/17/18"

4.25,"I first tried this many years ago when I first started getting into whiskey and it scored a 5. Now wind forward a few years and coming up to 500 unique drams later (not all on distiller), I've got a lot harder on scoring. Most drams have dropped a star on retaste and this is no exception. Unfortunately I drank this after Van winkle 10 and Pappy 15 so the benchmark was set high. Now it's still a very good dram. If the 10 yr was 3.5 - 3.75, the 15yr 4.25 - 4.5, this is around the 4 to 4.25 for me. As I'm drinking it I'm thinking about the 15yr and missing it already. Spice hits you first up, mint or eucalyptus, clove, oak and maple syrupor caramel...similar to the Colonel rye in a way but a bit better. It's thinner than the 15 Pappy and Weller (is it their wheat influence perhaps?). And so as yet another 5 star falls my Beasts of Bourban from Buffalo Trace tour finishes. Of the several some good a number great."

5.0,"Nose - (w/o water) Dark chocolate covered raisins & espresso beans, leather, coke syrup (w/ water) Very similar but more tannic leather.

Taste - (w/o water) Sweet cinnamon/white pepper heat/tingle, intense dark caramel sweet, coke syrup, dark chocolate, dried cherries, dark toffee, light oak & leather (w/ water) Less burn, more leather, oaky coke syrup, treacle toffee, cherry caramel.

Finish - (w/o water) Hot oaky leather (in a good way), dark chocolate, coke syrup, light cherry (w/ water) More drying, cinnamon, dark chocolate, light cherry.

Score - 91/100

Final Thoughts - This one was quite good but for some reason it didn't have as much ""cherry coke"" notes as I typically get from Stagg Jr. but instead it was replaced by this sweet leather note, which I guess comes with more age in a barrel. This was quite tasty and didn't have any off-putting notes whatsoever but I guess it kind of let down the BTAC expectations of a ""premium"" bourbon. Don't get me wrong, this was still tasty, but I really wish it offered more of the cherry coke syrup flavor profile I love in the Stagg Jr. releases.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes

Would I buy a bottle? - Yes, but not at the inflated secondary prices"

I don’t remember it being like this when I first cracked the bottle, but tasting it now after it has breathed for a few months, it is almost syrupy... I recall it being a bit more brash. But now it’s like an energetic puppy that has grown up a little bit and settled down, and it’s truly fantastic in its maturity. Layer upon layer of flavor - starting off sweet, cherry, chocolate, and moving into oak, leather, tobacco, cinnamon spice... it’s rich and full and complex. The heat starts to catch up a little on the back end, and the long finish ultimately winds up at a slightly bitter yet pleasant note - think roasted coffee. It’s unfair how little of this there is to go around because it’s a truly spectacular pour."

A drop of water REALLY brought out the maple syrup.  It also brought a hint of oak.

Taste: very tannic and strong.  Oak and a little bit of sweet.  

After a drop of water, the maple syrup comes out in the taste.  The bourbon calms down a bit and becomes more enjoyable on the palate.

4.0,Leathery sweet nose. Palate is spicy and sweet and slightly pruny. The high alcohol level is present from beginning to end. Very warm chest. Ice mellows the spice and brings flavor depth forward.

5.0,"What a nose. Intense leather, spice cake, maple syrup, woodsy oak, pipe tobacco, black cherry, vanilla extract, cinnamon rolls. Every freakin time I put down the glass and pick it back up again it gets more complex. This is intoxicating.

Wow! I'm not getting much heat on this which is amazing. It lets all the flavors just dance on my tongue and it is super smooth. Vanilla, charred oak, cherry pie, maple syrup, cinnamon, all intense and evolving. It just doesn't end and it just gets better. 

This is just straight up delicious bourbon. Best dram I've ever had, and I don't think it's close. It really has it all and I will savor it for as long as I can take it. Special occasion stuff"

5.0,"BACKGROUND: This bottle was gifted to me by a good friend for Christmas in 2017, and it is opened only on anniversaries, birthdays, and other special occasions.  I took it off the shelf today especially for this review.

The bourbon’s namesake, George T. Stagg, was a business partner of Col. E.H. Taylor, and together they built the most successful distillery of the 19th Century.

Using a mashbill recipe of Kentucky corn, Minnesota rye, and North Dakota malted barley, the bourbon was distilled to 135 proof and entered the barrel at 125 proof in the spring of 2002.

Though 2019 is the rare exception, George T. Stagg is usually the highest octane offering in the famed and highly-sought Buffalo Trace Antique Collection.  The 2017 offering was bottled at 129.2 proof.

It spent more than 15 years and 3 months in barrels from Warehouses C, K, M, and Q. This batch consisted of only 309 barrels, and, as always, it is uncut and unfiltered.

NOSE: A wonderful combination of leather and maple syrup. Perhaps a bit of cherry lingers in the background.  There is a surprising lack of ethanol given the proof.  I would wear this as cologne if I could. 

PALATE: The maple syrup on the nose converts completely into maple syrup on the palate.  I sense some chocolate covered cherries on the tongue, as well.  The bourbon is sinfully viscous in texture.  It begs the question, “Can a bourbon be called ‘sexy’?”

FINISH: The sweetness continues, but there is also some mint on the back of the tongue.  Oak flavors develops, as well.  Though the finish is a long one, there is no pepper and no bite.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: You would think that a bourbon at this proof drinks hotter than a hooker’s door knob on nickel night, but the 2017 George T. Stagg sips easier than Sunday morning.  This might not be the absolute best bourbon I have ever sampled, but it is certainly in the top damn three.  Since there is no way to replace this bottle, I will be rationing it like I am stranded in the desert with a thimbleful of water.  A simply fantastic bourbon experience.  It gets the rare five cork pops out of five."

5.0,Absolute perfection. Worth spending some extra coin at a bar just to see what all the hype is about.
4.5,"Nose- Musty leather initially; powdered sugar; fruit punch candies; vanilla cake; maple syrup; aged, funky oak; sweet caramel 

Palate- Wave of drying leather; grassy-earthy note; aged oak; red licorice; deep caramel; cherries; cinnamon; vanilla

Finish- Long, drying and mouth coating; Rich oak; cherry syrup; vanilla bean


Everything I expect from a Stagg. Big, bold, and full of oak and fruit. The heat is a little intense at times, but it’s overall very balanced and tasty. The nose is to die for. Incredibly complex and a bouquet of aromas. The palate isn’t quite up to the level of the nose, but it’s still great. Bold, a bit hot, and full of leather, oak, fruits, and red licorice. The finish is, as all staggs are, long. Tons of oak with some cherry syrup and vanilla bean. Not as good as the 2018, but still quite a fantastic bourbon."

4.5,"Finished 3/5 of a bottle, free-hand 2+oz pour at a time, with Matt the Lion at Trio Grill in Merrifield. Sat down at the bar, saw the bottle, heard the $35 price, called in the cavalry and drained the f*cker.  Poured neat in rocks glass.  Rich, spicy, oak, caramel, loooong finish.  Just awesome.  8/12/19"
