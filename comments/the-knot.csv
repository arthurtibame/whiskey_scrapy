3.0,County Cavan!!! Never realized that it wasn't an actual whisky. Makes sense though. Heat up front giving away to a lot of caramel sweetness.

2.75,"Super sweet. Saw it at a bar, and didn’t realize exactly what it was. I feel hoodwinked! Starts off with very strong notes of vanilla and caramel and maybe honey and a strong alcohol punch. After the third sip, tastes like straight banana pudding. I was def hoping for something a bit more nuanced, even if it is strong."
