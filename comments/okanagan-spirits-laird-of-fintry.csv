4.25,"Nose: Butterscotch, maple, vanilla.  Hints of butter and white chocolate coming through as well.  There is some surprising and interesting brinyness to the nose as well.

Palate: Really rich initially with a lot of vanilla. Some maple coming through but not like a typical Canadian whisky. Next, some spiciness enters the equation rounding out the tasting experience.

Finish: Medium in length. Some milk chocolate and tobacco.  The malt lingers with subtle notes of sour beer. 

Overall, this whisky tastes young. However, it's got a great overall flavour profile and has a lot of potential. I look forward to tasting future, older iterations and will definitely plan to purchase some of these future offerings!"

4.5,"The nose is full of rich dried fruits like raisins and apricot with a hint of vanilla sweetness and a slight beeswax note. The palate features dark fruits and the European oak really comes out on the finish with a burst of spice. Mature beyond its years. 

Tasted Lot 5, Bottled 2018."
