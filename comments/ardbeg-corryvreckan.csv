4.75,Very complex whisky. Nose starts out very peaty and medicinal. This fades over time and shows a briny sweet fruity backdrop. With smoke present throughout. The taste hits in waves. Smokey medicinal briny seaweed on the first. Fruity cotton candy on the long second wave I can almost feel the texture of the delicious treat in melting my mouth. The finish is long and smokey sweet ash with an oaky quality. That sugar covered campfire taste will be in my mouth for an hour. Delicious stuff.
4.25,extremely complex. every sip is giving me a different flavor. take it slow with this one... not just for the adventerous flavors but it may knock you out

4.5,"This is fantastic stuff. Throughly Ardbeg with some extra punch.

The signature smoke is there with a whole lot more. The bitter tea flavours really jumped out at me. The tea flavours and the peat combined into a kind of pine-y spruce-like flavour. I am a big fan. Would love to spend some more time with this.

PS: go to Grey Tiger"

4.75,"You tell based on the nose that this Ardbeg is quite complex with complex wood notes. The smoke and brine notes of the 10 are more rounded and calmer with other flavors popping up around it like stone fruit sweetness and seaweed. Being cask strength, it definitely gives you a kick in the pants, but it’s not without flavor. There is this flavor of flower pedals but imagine smelling them while in a damp and musty cellar. It’s gives this kind of damp earthiness characteristic that is quite nice. Compared to other Ardbegs, it’s comparable to the Uigeadail. It has a similar nuttiness characteristic, but the damp and musty flower pedals are new and exciting flavors."

Very enjoyable - probably the most enjoyable peated malt. But something was still missing. When I got a bottle of Uigeadail and tried it, I understood what was missing.

Nose: richly layered, candied lemon peel, ginger, vanilla, sweet malt. Then the phenols: ocean spray, tide pool, wet hay, graphite pencil. 

Palate: a lot of follow through from the nose. Oily and yet clean, candied ginger, citrus, blood orange, clean malt, gunpowder, barrel spice, peppercorns, slight tingling in the back of the throat, numbing the cheeks, asphalt, tobacco, and ash. 

Finish: creamy and sweet vanilla, leather, chocolate covered blueberries, white pepper, sweet tobacco leaf."

4.5,"Appearance: Clover honey gold is the color, with super thin oily legs clinging to the glass.

Nose: The nose takes you on a wild delicious journey. First appear citrusy notes of orange and lemon, followed by smokey salty peat, soaked dead leaves, and savory bacon grease. And wrapping around it all, notes of honey, cut grass, and maple syrup. With a splash of water, it becomes much sweeter and the peat takes the back seat letting a more floral aroma shine. The combo reminds me of aromatic pipe smoke.

Taste: The savory palate has notes of peat, oak, bacon / BBQ char, cigar smoke, and red apple; it is quite delicious. With a splash of water a green grape note comes forward more prominently.

Finish: The finish is long, subtle, and lingering with notes of peat and chewy orange slice candy. With a splash of water, it gets more bitey like with wood tannins.

Thoughts: Right off the bat, I’m going to say don’t water it down. Initially though, I really love this whisky! It is delightful to smell and delicious to my palate, I would be happy to buy this again and anyone on the fence about trying it I say go for it! Ardbeg, thank you for your quality scotch! Sláinte!"

4.5,"Ah, the much-beloved aroma that wafts out of this bottle after opening. In the glass, I find the nose on Corryvreckan doesn’t do the strength that simmers beneath justice. Smoked briquettes, sweet fruit, and seaweed. At full strength on the palate, it’s rich, intense, masterful, and delicious. Chargrilled meats, boldly roasted coffee grounds, sweet and tangy cherries, and pepper. The finish seems everlasting...just when you think it’s ending, it’s reveals something new. Ridiculously smooth and drinkable at 114 proof, but it can benefit from the addition of water too. 

Just remember, no swimming.

Like other Islay, it definitely becomes sweet once your senses get past the smoke. But for me, the peat, a floral note and  sweetness stays till the end...  Oh....

4.25,"Neat in a Glencairn at home. Tasted next to the Ardbeg 10 for comparison.  I do like the 10, so have high hopes here.

Nose has a big hit of black pepper and smoked meat, with some brine and stone fruit peeking through.  Pick up some ethanol heat as well.   Taste is very bold, like the nose but on steroids.  The pepper and smoke remain strong, along with an increased bitterness on the front and tail.  The mid palate is full of apples, heather, sea air, and meadow grasses.  Definitely sense the increased proof over the 10, and it is bigger and more complex.  This is not an easy sipper, but it is very good.  10/3/19."

3.75,I'd like to taste this side by side with the Ardbeg 10.  The Corryvreckan is an Ardbeg 10 that includes NAS whiskey matured solely in french cask. This was as peaty as a I recall the Ardbeg. This is the type of scotch that my wife asks me to re-cork because she can smell the campfire from across the kitchen. A small pour had my ears red hot. Everything smelled and tasted like cigar for a week. I'd do that again.

4.25,"I've had to revise my initial rating, as subsequent tastings have been far more positive (Note: This my first peated Scotch, and how peated it is!).  All tasting was performed neat, with NO water added.

Initially, the smokey pork and peat clubs you over the head and doesn't stop.  However, leaving in the mouth for an extra 10-20 seconds shows this is far more complex than just a peat monster.  The subtleties blossom into a very sweet yet mildly tart cherry/blackberry.  The finish is reminiscent of a lit cigar melded with pepper.

An interesting thing I noticed that while high in ABV, this was very gentle and smooth, with a couple of caveats.  If left in the mouth for longer than 20-30 seconds, the heat starts to build, which is the opposite of every other cask strength whisky I've ever had.

It's not something I'd want every day, and subjectively tastes much better during cooler months, but it's a staple of my cabinet going forward."

4.75,"Excited to experience this after reading reviews and ratings plus I love the 10 yr. Poured neat, darker color than 10yr with thick oily legs and complex powerful nose. Dense pinewood smoke with strong heat settles to rich salted chocolate sweetness wrapped in bacon with hints of malt. Heavy thick cream mouth feel delivers intense smoke, sweet malt with dark chocolate, burnt fatty end from a char grilled ribeye with fresh ground sea salt and peppercorns ending with a tar like note. Savory and luscious, the flavor explodes on your palate. The finish is long with strong smoke, char, tobacco, trailing malt sweetness and drying barrel wood. Its not overbearing or least bit harsh even at 114 pf( wouldn't believe it if not on bottle). Its warming, rich and delicious. Yes it costs a bit but wow its fantastic. I will probably get a bottle of this and stash for special occasions/limited use. I drank this side by side with the 10yr for comparison. It is meatier, heavier and packs a wallop. The 10 yr has the smoke more dominate in its profile and for the money is better value but hey you only live once so get both! .........97/100"

Compared to Ugi, it’s got an ashy quality to it, and a much dryer smoke profile. It’s lovely, and you can tell the influence from the French oak and bourbon casks. I think I still prefer the sherry influence from Ugi or An Oa, but there is no bad Ardbeg. Just good Ardbeg and better Ardbeg. Cheers!"

Smoked ham with a blackberry glaze.  Caramelized sugar.  Rubber and rope.  The smell of a fresh cut lawn in the spring, complete with the fumes coming off your lawnmower.

Palate: Peat - earth, moss, wet tree bark, tar, campfire ash.  Strawberries, bananas, mint.  Black pepper.  Lemon and lime oils.  Stone fruits.  Molasses.  Dried thyme and basil.  Dill, star anise.  Wintergreen comes up again.  Brine.  Meaty.  Alcohol is prickly - definitely makes its presence known though it doesn't detract from the experience.  Finish begins with a low key brine, mint, peat, ash combo.  Things slowly build and bitter tannins show up, presenting as coffee and high cacao chocolate - that mint note carries through.  Things slowly fade into ethanol, wintergreen, vanilla, and a medicinal brine note.  Menthol, as well - I'm reminded of the Chloraseptic sore throat spray I used as a kid whenever I had strep throat (which was often).

Other notes: I always forget just how good this bottle is.  Full of classic Ardbeg character, Corryvreckan shows what's possible when you get into high proof territory.  As this opens up, there are some added layers that are really appealing.  This stands up exceptionally well to cigars - definitely reach for your more full-bodied maduros."

This demands to be heard.  This is what I think Sartre would have drank.  Strong dark fruit, peaty but not overpowering, heat, pepper, toffee, and coffee.

Finish: a little underwhelming at first, but then builds. Spice and heat.  Dry, long, and ashy"

4.0,"The nose is Ardbeg-heavy with smoke and charcoal, softening to a honey-baked ham.  After the initial sip, the nose is more honeyed.  

The initial palate is  intensely-charred wood with sweetness swishing in and out, before finishing with a dominant, bacon note.  The very high ABV of 57% is much smoother than anticipated.  It's a bit dark and seductive, like Nicole Dörmer - the 'lebensborn' blonde character - in the ""The Man In The High Castle"" TV series. 

A teaspoon of water tames the smell to bourbon-cask and citrus notes lent by the French limousine oak.  The palate opens up with honey sweetness, while highlighting the smoke into a spicier profile, and muting the bacon element.  

After buying and, for the most part, enjoying the Oogie and the Ardbeg 10, I am disappointed with this.  I had high hopes. The Uigeadail is leagues tastier and lower in price.  If money and shelf space were no object, I'd keep the trifecta of the mentioned Ardbegs on rotation.  But there are peated expressions from other distilleries that are worth exploring.

2.5,"Always fun going back to the classics and this has always been one of my favorite Ardbegs. Lets see if it stands up after what has to have been 2 years since I last had it.

Nose - Mint, medicinal rubber, citrus, caramel, a mix of smoke and burn plastic. Oh boy this smells young and unrefined. I'm a bit worried about drinking it. Water brings out more fruity elements.

Taste - ok so a lot to discuss here. Opens soft and sweet with some perhaps lime like the ardbeg 10 gives off. It transitions into some young and unrefined medicinal sweet caramel and new make like spirit notes, but then we comes out of that and brings in that coffee and perhaps not a chocolate but a darker sweet which has always been my love with this whisky. I think I'm getting some ginger spice notes. The finish it's medium to somewhat long but mostly just a peppery warm heat.

Water tames the beast, still a peppery experience but it brings all those flavors swirling around more into focus and I'm not sure that's a good thing here. Some of the youth is gone and that younger new make element is faded, but oh there it is...I'm getting a touch of banana which was there before and really screams young whisky. 

57.1% this thing is throwing the high heat and you know, it's mostly landing them. That said while this is no longer a standout whisky for me, there's still plenty to enjoy with this one. I hate to say it but it feels like I'm growing past Ardbeg as I explore better whiskies or perhaps their quality is falling. 

Anyway I'm still at 2.5 here. Wonderfully complex, very bold, very creamy and rich mouth feel, and a whisky I dare say any peat head would appreciate. There's more than enough here for most whisky lovers, but there are too many flaws to move this into the 3.0's where I feel whiskies are starting to get special."

5.0,"Wooooohoooo that is a powerful dram! I have seen a lot of cask strenght reviews in this month, so i am trying to keep up with the trend. Ardbeg Corryvrekan is one of those mythical drams out there that if you try at least once you must talk about it everytime, everyday.

57.1%abv, surely feels like a 90%.

On the nose is quite interesting without been perfect. Smoked pork, Green grapes, Peat, Butter, White wine, Water balloon latex. Those are my notes on the aroma.

On the palate, it is THE BOMB. Tasty and powerful. Way too powerful. A spice bomb, Nerf toys (yep, you read that right) (yep, i have tasted them) grape juice. Margarine. Incredible.

Aftertaste is salty but mostly sulfuric. Too much for a normal human. 

Overall this amazing dram, deserves a 98 over 100. Slainte!"
5.0,Ultimately complex
3.75,"N: Peat, Alcohol, some sweetness hidden
P: Peat, light sweetness. Light mouthfeel, not too oily. Sweetness comes out more later. 
F: Smoke, Dry, Burnt

I like the Uigedaal and 10 better. This one lacks some of the same complexity and thickness of the Uugedaal.  

Opens up a lot with water, gets sweeter."

4.5,"Nose - Smokey, bacon, slight brine, slight chemical whiff but not unpleasant, iodine, tanned leather 
Taste - initial intense sweet and salty flavor, almost like kettle corn. Smoked meat and light smoke and bit of an acid tang. Really intense but enjoyable. 
Finish - lingering comfortable burn, oily and pleasant."

5.0,"I thought I had enjoyed peat with Lagavulin, now this is really different with this Cory. I found Lag was possibly rounder. 
This, on the other hand is totally upfront and potent. Medicinal on the nose, with some dried apricots, smokey and petrol with a hint of maritime scent. 
The palate is like fireworks. The alcohol is indeed high (57%ABV) and brings a tingle on my tongue but in a pleasant way adding a new dimension to the palate. The notes felt (for me) and found are very savoury (bacon, charred meat on a BBQ), and mostly chocolate, tobacco and leather.
To note this my first tasting since opening this brand new bottle and looking forward to seeing it evolve with time."

5.0,"This is a home run for me, my favorite Ardbeg so far and easily in my top 10.
The nose promises peaty smoke and hints of sweetness.
The mouth delivers something very viscous, briny, meaty and wonderfully peppery sweetness.
Aftertaste is spicy, smokey and sweet.
This just hits all my buttons the right way."

4.25,"This is another very strong offering from Ardbeg. The nose is almost all peat, but it goes along with a touch of that classic Ardbeg sweetness. Peat and smoky sweetness continue on the palate. The finish is nice, with a slight bite. I don’t like this as much as Uigeadail, I prefer those nice sherry notes, and without them, this comes across as more of a standard, albeit excellent Islay scotch."

4.0,"Rich with a more subtle but longer lasting sweetness than the uigeadail. Notes of fruit, vanilla, and some spices are present alongside the standard Ardbeg coffee and tobacco. Slightly better than the uigeadail.
Compared to Lagavulin 16, there is a stronger flavor of tobacco bitterness here, but there is also some more fruity playfulness. The balance is good here, but not as brilliant as that of the Lagavulin 16. Notably though, the Ardbeg Corryvreckan goes its own way. I just wish that the sweetness lasted longer into the finish so that the ending was not complete bitterness. There is some great depth here, but you have to be willing to sell the taste buds to tobacco (or maybe iodine) to experience it.
On a totally odd note, it's weird how pale this scotch can be while being totally full of peat.
There is so much complexity here. It is really strong, both in flavor and alcohol content, but the peat and other rich flavors counterbalance the alcohol. As it progresses, so many flavors come out: tobacco, cocoa, faint vanilla, mild red fruit, a slight hint of minerals, and so many other mixtures. It's delightful. This is a rich whiskey rather than a sweet one, but it is amazingly complex and has a slightly sweet finish. What a delight!"
