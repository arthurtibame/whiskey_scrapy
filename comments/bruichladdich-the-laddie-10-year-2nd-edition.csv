4.5,"This one really grew on me. It started off pretty meh, but really opened up over the last few months. On the nose I get a slight minerality and then some fresh tropical  fruit. Palate has a cool and salty entry then spicy. The fruit carries over and there is a slight smoke, not peat but more like the barrel char you get from bourbons. The finish is long and I get bits of liquorice. 

Finished this last night. So good. It definitely got better after a while in the bottle. A salty, mineral quality really came out. It was salty, fruity, and full bodied. I’m going to miss this. The Classic Laddie has a lot of what this had going for it, but it is not as refined nor complex. 

90/100"

3.0,When first opened the nose was fruity but felt rather tight and on the palate this carried through . The finish has a nice lemony twist to it. Adding a few drops however opened up the nose nicely though still no butter scotch in its finish but rather that a Bunsen burnet went through this
