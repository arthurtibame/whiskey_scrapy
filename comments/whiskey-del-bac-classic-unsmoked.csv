Thoughts: Disappointing, because I'm a Tucson, AZ native and I initially didn't like this very much - I was upset that I bought this...even on sale. But coming back to it, this has improved a full-point. I don't anticipate pushing this to a 3, as I continue to reluctantly drink this - I have over 10 other whiskies open which will easily allow me to reach past this. I hear the distillery is good, especially with their smoked barley offerings. Hope the next one I try redeems my hometown."
2.0,"I accidentally bought this bottle instead of the Del Bac Dorado ( which marketing genius made them look 99% alike???!!).  I had some family coming over, and knowing they love Glenfiddich 12, I took a wild guess they might like this.  I was right—-was totally devoured.  Me, on the other hand, not a fan.  Maybe for the same reason that I don’t like Glenfiddich 12...bland, boring, too tepid.  

Starts off with mild heather /honey combo, some cinnamon, allspice, but fades really quickly.  Given that the Dorado is just a bit more, go for that—-it’s so much better ( probably my favorite affordable American whiskey).  But—-if you want something safe, non-combative, easy to please masses ( holiday party) go for this."

F - breezy/mint, tobacco, pepper

Included in a Bourbon Charity blind tasting. Voted number one for me out of 5 AZ whiskies. I’m a big fan of the smoked version of Del Bac so was fun to try the classic - found some similar notes too. It was very complex especially up against other AZ distilleries. 

Sampled at home."
3.5,"Went to a Del Bac tasting tonight with their brand ambassador. Tried several of their expressions and I can say that each of their expressions has a unique flavor profile. 

The classic is nice but reminds me of other American single malts like Stranahans or Westland. Good stuff but doesn’t stand out like the Dorado."

4.5,"Immediately reminded of heating up apple cider on the stove top. A couple dashes of cloves, allspice, cinnamon, and a splash of bourbon. 
That chest warmth, spices, and vanilla. 
I get Speyside-like caramel, nutty Sherry (even though it isn’t sherry finished) dried grass, and dense homemade bread...almost banana or zucchini bread.

I’m a huge huge fan of the Dorado, but it is nice tasting what Hamilton is capable of without the smoke."

This was a Private Barrel Release."
