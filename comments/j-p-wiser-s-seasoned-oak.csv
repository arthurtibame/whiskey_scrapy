null,"This reminds me a lot of the Lot 40 Cask Strength released last year, but the slightly lower alcohol content and the longer age give it a little bit more  subtlety and makes for a very well rounded, spicy, and enjoyable Rye. I would strongly encourage anyone to make the effort to get a hold of one, albeit's an LCBO exclusive."

5.0,"I bought a bottle of this wonderful Whisky and immediately ordered 4 more. I prefer it to Dissertation, which is saying a lot. It is very smooth and I don't taste any alcohol burn at 48%. It releases a lot of different flavors and is very satisfying. I can't wait to see how this limited edition taste bomb does at the World Whisky Awards. Don Livermore has proved again that he is a genius."
4.0,"Tasting Notes

• Nose (undiluted): figs and raisins alongside some brown sugar, a hint of barrel char, a subtle floral note in the background

• Palate (undiluted): rich and waxy, some rye spice, pepper, a little coconut, fresh cut oak

• Finish: medium length, sweet toffee returns, some vanilla, the barrel char notes return, with some cloves and fresh coconut lingering alongside the slightly perfumed floral notes

• With water, this whisky gets much more floral, with a lingering hint of incense on the finish. It may sound odd, but it isn't at all unpleasant. The floral notes remind me of some exotic flowers I’ve never smelled before. That may sound ridiculous to include in a tasting note, but it’s the best I can do as I am no botanist.

• The bottle gets better and more interesting with time. It’s too bad this isn’t a permanent part of the Wiser’s lineup.

• Rating: 89/100 points"

4.75,Best pure Canadian whiskey I’ve had. Smooth and full of character.
4.5,"The nose starts off with spicy, toasted oak sitting alongside well with creamy fudge, vanilla, and clove. Toasted oak comes across right away on the palate with vanilla and caramel next to it, backed up by baking spices, primarily clove. On the finish, the spiciness gives way to chocolate that lingers with toasted oak, while the vanilla and caramel fades in a way that can almost be missed."

A respiré dans le verre 20 minutes

Nez: Délicat et subtile avec de la vanille crémeuse et du bois du genre brin de scie au premières effluves. Épices de seigle, clou de girofle et poivre concassé. Amandes, Caramel brûlé marshmallow. Légère poire bosc et bleuets sauvages.
palais : texture crémeuse sucré, mais bien balancée en arrivé. fudge au chocolat, vanille, fruits extra mûrs. le chili et la cannelle se pointe en évolution en bouche la vanille reviens et le bois s'installe. 
finale : épices de bois, astringente, sèche. Ça me rapelle le baton de bois après avoir mangé de la tire d'érable. 

Encore une fois un excellent Wiser's"

4.0,"Soft mellow rye spice you only get with a well aged rye. Much more mellow than the dissertation but more drama to the palate then the 18yo. A soft comfortable rollercoaster. Think honey, vanilla, black pepper, and slight cinnamon. Good quality pickup"
