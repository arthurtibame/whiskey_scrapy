2.5,"It’s getting better with age. However, it still shows some youth. On the nose, I get a sweet sweet corn, maybe a little cinnamon, and generally just corn. On the pallet, I get a little burn. Also, a decent amount of sweet. This is an a horrible bourbon. However, we can use an age"
0.5,Best I can say is it’s local. Tastes like water from a bucket of ground corn soaked overnight.

2.75,Very young and corn heavy. Trying on the rocks tonight. Did a sample in the hand and definitely can smell the corn. The palpate is almost young corn whiskey. Not the best in my collection but I want to support a small local craft distillery.

3.25,Caramel corn on the nose.  Sweet caramel and vanilla on the palate. Short oaky finish.
