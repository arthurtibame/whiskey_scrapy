4.5,"Very strong raisan, currant xmas fruit thing going on here. Reminds me instantly of the 13 year Hazelburn Olorosso without the excessive sulfur (although there is a tinge along with bitterness on the aftertaste). Leaving it to open up for 30 mins definitely improves things (or maybe it just gave my palate time to adjust). A lovely example of a sherry cask. 4.25 to 4.5 for me. One of 1428 bottles, now sold out. I can see why batch 1 could have won the WWA blended whisky category."
