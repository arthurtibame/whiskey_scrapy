4.5,"What is a special occasion? A round birthday? Wedding day? Being alive after 4 weeks with COVID-19 definitely ticks all the boxes, so let's pop the cork of Springbank 25! Matured in a combination of sherry and rum casks, the nose features tropical fruits, sugar cane molasses and fresh herbs, sage and thyme in particular. Complex wood spices, dark chocolate and quality rum notes dominate the palate, followed by pineapple, orange zest and whiffs of smoke. The finish is long and herbal with a salty edge. A great dram for sure, but not as great as I thought.
