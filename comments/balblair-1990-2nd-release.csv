5.0,Awesome!  I love the '99 and this is just a touch nicer.  I don't think this should be called NAS.  It is essentially a 12yr old.

4.5,"Thick, woody spice is the first thing to hit, followed by toffee, nuts, marzipan, cloves, sherry, and a touch of leather.  The nose is that of a whisky slightly older than this bottling's 23 years.  Added cinnamon on the palate gives way to a bit of dark chocolate into the finish.  Phenomenal stuff; 4.5 stars."

5.0,"Excellent stuff, a very well balanced and complex sherried whisky, with a long finish, which for the price presents a good value - 25 years of highland dram for under 150."
5.0,"Stonefruit, raisins, butterscotch, and hints of milk chocolate on the nose. Fairly robust mouthful, with citrus, honey, dried fruit, and pleasant baking spices on the palate. Relatively long and fruity finish. Complex, balanced, tasty, and easy-drinking. Great quality dram."

5.0,"Rich dark fruit, honey, oak, spice and soft smoke. Very similar to Bowmore 15 Yr Darkest but a little more robust and a little less sweet. Delicious but not worth the shocking price tag. $296 in Ontario."
5.0,"Mine is the 2015  bottling.  Of the sherried scotches I've had, this is the best by far.  The flavors are rich and full, and the nose is incredible.  Highly recommended."

3.0,Had again with Tim and Elizabeth in Cancun. Previous notes hold up. But it gets more delicious as it sits. Caramelly and rich. Complex but still bitter. Tim likes it more than I do.

4.0,Interesting flavour profile. Vanilla and sherry with a slight heavyiness on the wood - tannic and bitterness. I warmed up to this as I got into it. Mid to late 3's for me and a fair price at $125USD. Wouldn't be on my purchase list but would be interesting to see how a whole bottle opens up over time

4.0,"This is a delicious whisky, with layers of flavour to keep you enthralled for minutes on end. Generous notes of pear with spiced vanilla and almond are the first thing that greet  your nose. To the palate you have additional aromas of oak and almond paste. The finish is mellow and velvety with touches of spice and brown sugar. Very good!"

4.75,"Rich, warm Christmas cake and spices. Light balanced sweetness. Bottled 2017"
4.25,"This is very hard to find now. Mine was bottled in 2016 so 26 years of maturation. Those years seem well spent as it is a fine dram. Since it is older, you should sip at pouring but let it rest a while. The nose is a nice citrus smell, maybe orange and a little earthy to me. On the palate it is sweet and malty and if you just hold it and let it dissolve it will show you all that it has to offer as it changes from sweet malt to a touch of sherry and citrus and finally it ends in peppery oaky spice. The finish is very long and spicy. Not a well known brand, mostly used in blends, but known to Scotch lovers and it does not disappoint. The first over 21 year old Whisky I acquired and well worth it. Once it is gone, there will be no more... Slàinte Mhath!"
4.0,"The nose is sharp but sweet. Malt, honey, and oak are intertwined with faint hints of apricot and stewed strawberries. On the palate, the oak and sweet malt take over with a definite punch from the higher ABV. Initially a straightforward dram, but offers increasing rewards the longer you sit with it."

3.75,Straight up tastes like bourbon.
5.0,"I have been busy, but not too busy to still continue to explore whisky.  There’s just been no time for documentation, and not much inspiration to write about a bottle, until I finished Balblair 1990 2nd release, and decided to reminisce about this beauty.

I have come to the conclusion that it is silly, after having had literally hundreds of different whiskies, to continue to give “82/100” to a forgettable, but inoffensive dram.  My new rating system will be Michelin inspired.  Forgettable whiskies will score a 0 – and most whiskies are forgettable.  Unforgettable whiskies will score 1.  Unimaginably good whiskies will score 2.  Unparalleled transcendent whiskies will score 3.  And, to fairly satisfy the 5 star system this app uses, I will compare how much I think a bottle should cost, and how much the bottle actually costs, and give a rating based on that.

Balblair 1990 is three stars.  I fucking love this whisky.  People are upset that Balblair has modernized their range, and is now selling a 25 year old for $500.  Balblair has consistently been one of the best distilleries in the past 5-10 years, right up there with the likes of Springbank, but they have always undervalued their own worth, and they are just now charging the fair-market price for their whiskies now.  This Balblair 1990 is 24-25 years old, and it was selling for $150!

There is actual bourbon influence on the nose.  For most scotches, “bourbon influence,” means a light “breakfast” whisky where the malt dominates.  This smells like a full-bodied fine bourbon, rich tobacco and cherries, Pappy Van Winkle; but this is balanced with a single malt presence that is secondary, but still significant.  On the palate, it goes from bourbon to sherry, and that is the right order of flavors; starting with American oak toffee and vanilla sweetness, progressing to raisins and dark fruits, and finishing with cocoa, leather, and tobacco.  A 25 year old Balblair is better than a 25 year old Springbank, or a 25 year old Macallan, or a 25 year Balvenie.  They deserve to start charging whatever they want.

Score: *** (unparalleled transcendent)
How much does a bottle cost: $150-180 (may no longer be available)
How much do I think a bottle is worth: $500"
4.75,the best scotch i had so far. enough said.
4.5,"Always a bit off the beaten track, Balblair was one of few distilleries sticking to vintage bottlings until just recently. Distilled in 1990 and bottled in 2015, the aroma of this Highlander is a true delight. Blood oranges, papaya and delicate spices intermingle with cereals, lemongrass and hints of cocoa. A complex and well-balanced flavor profile marks the palate: fruity-sweet and spicy at first, the taste develops more floral, aromatic and mildly acidic. Chocolaty-bitter, warming and almost sparkling, the prolonged finish waves farewell. A great Single Malt to savor!

4.75,"Compared to the 1999 3rd (18 years old) this one is much darker in every way...Nose is actually similar with this one focusing more on the stewed fruits, but the palate is where the experience jumps dramatically. This 1990 ~25 year old is super sticky and rich, without being syrupy. Closest comparison would be the Highland Park The Dark 17 year old, which was a lighter version of this for twice the price. Balblair knocked it out of the park with this one, and comparing against the younger brother definitely enhanced the quality of the 1990. Grab this (or the 1991) while you still can."
5.0,"-46% abv
-Non chill-filtered
-Natural color
-Aged in ex bourbon for 23 years then finished for 2 in oloroso cherry casks.

Nose: rich, Christmas cakey and complex. Notes include: vanilla cream; honey; red apple; fresh strawberry; dark plum; pear; clove; cinnamon; lemon meringue; slight floral; slight pepper; grassy almost herbal note hiding in the background.

Taste: medium viscosity but full. It starts out sweet with bright red fruits, dark fruits, and sugary plums and dates along side a hint of root beer/cola. As it develops, a gentle but assertive cinnamon spice and note of pepper kicks in along side rich toffee and dark cherry. Simply fantastic. With water, a tropical clementine orange and kiwi appears. Not. Even. Kidding. 

Finish: one of the longest I’ve ever experienced. Mouth watering with honey, vanilla, a slight floral note, plum, honeydew melon, iced pastry, maple syrup, golden apple, and just when you think it’s over, you get light salted caramel and a sweet spearmint to close the show.

Value: while getting harder to find, you can get a bottle for between $170-200 and I suggest you do so.

Final thoughts: an amazing single malt at a great price. This is what I imagine a 30 year old Highland Park might taste like. This 25 year old Balblair should not fly under your radar...so start hunting!

Score: 5/5. Go out and buy it now!

4.0,"Had a pour of this last week during a business dinner in Denver.  Silky smooth.  A lot going on from the get-go...fruits, almonds, hazelnuts.  A huge potpourri of nuts and berries, like some health nut bar.  Can’t believe it’s 27 years old.  Great value at $10/pour too.  Would I buy a full bottle...?  Yeah...depends on the price, but yeah...one can do far worse."
