2.25,"Nose: spicy, salty, minerals and iodine. 

Palate: more minerals and iodine, some spice, light floral notes towards the end. Finishes with briny iodine. 

Found this at a liquor store with a fair discount as they were trying to get rid of this last bottle. It’s my first independent bottler and my first malt from the Isle of Mull. I enjoy trying new bottles and will gladly finish this one, but I wouldn’t buy a second."
5.0,"Bartender recommended me this seeing many independent bottlings in front of me not knowing what to order. Great sweet and smoky combination with notes of creamy vanilla, toffee, citrus, floral fruitiness, spices, and smoke."
