4.0,"The nose is an intoxicating mixture of oak, caramel, and vanilla. You're led falsely to believe in a predominantly sweet character that instead generously gives chestnuts, bread, heat, char, candied pecans, roasted corn, and walnuts. Gradually this savory character yields to the sweetness and spice of the initial beckoning: Caramel, caramelized banana, vanilla, cinnamon, and clove."

4.0,"Vanilla and caramel on the nose. Some floral notes. Viscous, very. Coats your mouth. It's thick, sweet notes, and a rush of spiced walnut. Pleasant bitterness at the end, a bit of leather and turpentine. Another winner in the Nicholson line. 5/5/17"
4.0,"Sweet on the front, fruity mid, spicy back.  Good on the rocks or in fruit-based cocktails.  Reasonably priced."

This is a no frills Bourbon that drinks very, very smooth. Drinks well below it's 100 proof. If you told me it was 80 proof I would not doubt it!  
As far as the flavor profile, it classic Bourbon. Vanilla and brown sugar upon entry, some dill and rye on the mid pallette with a medium clove and baking spices finish. It's not overly complex but you do keep coming back for more. One of the better Bourbon's for under $50"
4.0,Purchased on clearance for $23.00- a great buy-hence the 4 star-at regular price 3 star

4.0,"Very surprised at the flavor of this bourbon for the price point. Very nice light amber in the glass. On the nose I get corn, caramel, some candied cherries, oak, and slight vanilla. On the palate it has a nice rye spiciness to it and most of what I got on the nose comes through. Medium-long finish. Excellent bourbon in my opinion!"

4.0,"Powerfully wood-fronted, this borders close on ""oily"" territory. Being paired with this Italian food is the right move. Although the smell is a bit brighter with citrus notes, the age can mellow the night out in seconds. No need to try to break down the finish like crazy; think falling asleep in the rickhouse - wood again."

4.25,"Nose... Freshly baked and still warm Ginger and vanilla cookies, followed by pecan wood and a definite hint of Apple, black pepper and oats..

Appearance... Only a slight to medium amber nature which is deceiving since it achieves so much flavor it's basically shocking...

Taste... Cereal grains, pecan pie, sweet honey chocolate, rye grains and a definite vanilla coating making it's presence known...

Overall... Priceless.. At $30 a bottle and being able to get this as needed is wonderful. It has compete nuance in it's ability to take such flavor from the barrel. This is what I look for when I'm looking for depth. If it were a bit more viscous it would be dangerous as it's so good as is. You can literally chew on this whiskey, bite after bite I keep coming back for more... Thank you Mr. Nicholson...."

3.75,"Nose is oakier than expected for a NAS bourbon.  Includes hints of sawdust, corn and vanilla.  Palate blends a sweet, buttery caramel and maple.  As the bourbon progresses on the palate, hints of the rye spice show up before transitioning into the sweet corn/black pepper finish.  Overall, a solid bourbon for the price.  I'm sold as a daily drinker."

4.25,"When I was a young man, I believed that love had to be special. I was years behind my friends in romance, looking for the right one. I lost time and missed out on many opportunities due to this naive deference to sentimentality.

My 100th tasting note is David Nicholson.

Coming in at 100 proof (victory there), this hits my favorite ABV zone for bourbons. Nose straddles the line between tartness and astringency. I get apple, honey, lemon, and a bitter cedar hint. It’s good — would’ve been outstanding if it could’ve avoided the bitterness somehow and leaned fully toward tart/citrus.

Body hits forcefully with cinnamon and apple. Tastes very much like a fall desert there. Very good combination.

Overall, finish is both oily and spicy with pepper, more cinnamon, and powdered sugar.

Lux Row is doing a great job in the under-appreciated value/dollar space. Held next to Heaven Hill (which obviously has a deeper portfolio) I couldn’t tell you which delivers a better bottom-shelf value package. With the upcoming expansion to include Rebel Yell 100, I’m keeping my eye on Lux Row. If I wasn’t such a bourbon slut, perhaps I could’ve saved this 100th review for the historic restoration of Rebel Yell to a ABV over 40%. /cry"

4.25,"Color is on the darker side of golden. Legs are thin but viscous. Nose is soft and balanced; subtle aromas of vanilla, oak, and spice. Initial palate is warm and spicy; notes of brown sugar, vanilla, and spice with oak beneath. Finish is smooth and subtle, but still warm and long. Overall the high-rye mashbill creates the expected spiciness, and for 30 bucks this is a great casual sipping bourbon."

4.0,"I opened a bottle of this over the weekend with some family and we really enjoyed the taste of this bourbon. It is smooth but not subtle. You know you are drinking bourbon but that being said it is smooth especially when a bit of water or ice is added to it. It has a sharp flavor but it softens very quickly and is similar to Henry McKenna BOB but not quite as full of flavor. We tried 3 other bourbons and this one rated the best, not wheated bourbon. Wheller 107 won the wheated bourbons. It is just under $30 in my area and it is worth a try. I have recently upgraded my score as this bourbon has gotten better since being opened."
