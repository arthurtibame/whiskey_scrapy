5.0,Killer nose. Smooth with a lot of floral and vanilla. Heat follows with a very nice finish. I'd recommend as a top tier rye. Different than most but  better than most too.

5.0,"We'll start with the question we all ask: is it worth $200?? I think it is. It oozes complex flavors of citrus, stone fruit, honey, and spice. The concentration and finish lets you know its been in barrel long enough to drive, yet the integration holds the high proof in check."
5.0,Binny world of whiskey
5.0,👌🏼 Phenomenal. 🌈 Rainbow of flavors. I was more shocked and impressed with this rye in the first 5 seconds than ANY whiskey I’ve ever tried before.  Try this and be AMAZED like I was.

2.75,"Strong noce, classic whiskey notes, cola. But the palate diverges into the strange. Rubber tires, cough syrup, turpentine. Warmth. This definitely feels like a quality, complex pour, but the chemical notes are too noticeable to me. 2/22/19"
5.0,Favorite rye ever
5.0,"Tasted with GTS 2017, LSB18 , Bookers 2017-04, ECBP C918, WP boss hog

N- heat then sweetness / spice
P- fruits/dark chocolate/OAK
F- finish is long / oak/ lots of dark choc notes / astringency 

Stood out from the list above- much like how GTS2017 stands out on its own"

5.0,"I love the standard issue Hochstadter's vatted rye so this one had always peaked my interest! A few weeks back the most active member of the Arizona Whiskey Community @Hupperware graciously provided me a sample after a successful hunt (BTAC may have been slayed)... Thanks to this sample I bought the bottle and boy is it outstanding... Let's dive in...

It enters very oily... Wonderful mouthfeel with a blast of toffee, toasted oak, baking spices and a hint of spearmint....  Vanilla, clove, cinnamon, pipe tobacco and oak dominate the mid palate... Plums and and dried berries compliment oak and baking spices for a long finish! Truly wonderful.

This is as good as Rye Whiskey gets... Booker's Big Time Batch included...

Cheers all.."

4.5,"N - 123 proof for sure, pepper, floral
P - spicy but it evolves into something sweet, oaky and floral
F - Floral, nothing too huge, little bit of kick going down

Very complex rye, if you get the chance to try it don’t pass it up"

3.0,"This caught me off guard, great nose as well as palate, right up there with the best of them. The heat on this was intense, really intense, but here is the problem, the finish was sublime, mediocre at best, very little complexity to it, I really really wanted it to slap me in the face at the end, but it didn't."
