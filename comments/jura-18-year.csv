0.75,"Take some bottom-shelf whisky, mix in a cheap strawberry flavor fruit punch and then try not to gag. That's the Jura 18 experience without the cost of the actual whisky. If this had been around when Orwell wrote 1984 on Jura, he might have substituted it for the rats in room 101."

1.5,"This review is for the recently rebranded Jura 18 year old.  The entire line has been redone and reimagined, with new finishing casks, higher ABV’s, even bottle shape and label redesign.  This new 18 year old is matured in American white oak casks and advertised as being finished in “quality” red wine casks.  It’s also bottled at 44%, instead of the old, standard 40%.  It’s still chill filtered and has added color, however.  I decided to give this one a try because it was on sale from a European online shoppe for $74- great price for the hefty age statement.

It’s amber orange in the taster with watery, fat legs and smells of cherry, gummy candies and cough syrup right out of the bottle.  Uh oh.  After some appropriate time (15-20 minutes), I think I can detect real fruit and ripe berries, some light spearmint and very weak oak notes.  The zing from the mint doesn’t do enough to overcome the candied sugar note- and that isn’t good.

The palate starts out tasting like real cherry juice, but it’s thick and oily and a heckuva lot harsher than any 18 year old has any business being.  A mushy, malty backbone does its best to limit the sugary mess but the only thing that could save the mouthfeel now would be a heavy hit of oak and pepper or just plain, old ABV heat.  Too bad neither are anywhere to be found.

The finish subsides after a good while, I’d call it medium-long, but this is one I wish would’ve just gotten over and done with quickly.  The ABV shows up late too, and turns things overly hot and astringent.  There’s nothing redeeming about any part of the entire tasting experience.

Which leaves me sorely disappointed.  Cherry candy and minty syrup do not even make good cough syrup- much less a palatable whisky.  If I have to find a bright spot, well...it was only $74 for a bottle.  If you need an 18yo whisky on your bar to show off to your friends for cheap and don’t mind having to mix this with 7Up- well...this stuff is for you.  Everyone else should stay away- far away.  1.5 stars, with .5 of the score being for the price tag.  Cheers."

I understand that Jura can be one of those divisive distilleries. I have only previously had two of their offerings: Superstition (sharp and salty which I liked) and Origin (briny pet food which I didn’t like).

They have overhauled their range and those two are no longer available. At the Whyte and Mackay stand they had three from their new range: 10yo, 18yo and Seven Wood. We were told that the reason for the change was that whiskies from the previous range were very diverse, and so liking one Jura may not signify that you would like another. The feedback they received (presumably through Marketing) was that this led to an uneven, less favourable opinion of the overall output. Hence the need to create a new signature style with each whiskey in the range offering variations on a common theme.

The 18yo is aged in American white oak ex-bourbon barrels before finishing in Premier Grand Cru Classé Bordeaux barrels. It is peated and that comes through lightly on the nose along with brown sugar, oranges, caramel and faint acetone. The taste is sweet dryness at first, which develops into light smoke and coffee. I did think that the red wine finish masked or dampened the “salty maritime flavors” described in the Distiller review. In my view that is a mark against it.

I was quite happy with this on the day of the event but, having sneaked some out in a sample bottle, I lowered my view on a subsequent tasting."
2.75,"Although a peated whisky, there’s relatively little smoke. Briny, for sure. Short finish. Disappointing, having just sampled Highland Park 18. 3 cl sample from the 12 Drams of Christmas Premium (2019 Edition)."

2.5,"Initially an annoying alcoholic whiff arrives at the nose, vanishing with a little aeration, highlighting the fruity aromas of pineapple, mango, candied orange and hazelnut. Caramel, nutmeg and milk chocolate flakes complete the bouquet, rather simple but pleasant. Background woodiness.
The palate is less rich than than the nose, with a strong presence of wood that slides on the tongue bringing with it a noticeable vinous astringency. Once the impact is over, the fruity and sweet aspect of the whisky returns, albeit with a bitter base note that quickly breaks the balance, and the alcohol content (albeit low) roars too much, and in the end there is a slightly defined sweet and bitter mash.
Fairly short, very dry finish of hazelnuts and wood.
The nose was not great, but at least it made you think of a harmless but pleasant drink, and instead you find yourself with a mess that is not clear where it came from, with that cask of French wine launched in the mix without a clear reason, maybe in the (failed) attempt to save the salvable.
A memento for those who think that the more a whisky has aged the more it improves, to be summed up with a ""no fucking way""."
