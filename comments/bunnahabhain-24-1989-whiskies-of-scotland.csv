3.0,"This was a sample of an independently bottled Bunnahabhain available at Astor Wines & Spirits in New York. It has a light lemony nose with a hint of moss. Those flavors carry into the palate before they are overwhelmed by a powerful dose of peppery spice. (Bunnas of this age are unpeated, so that zest must be coming from the cask.) There's a hint of chocolate on the finish. Perfectly quaffable, but the balance between the wood and the spirit isn't ideal."
