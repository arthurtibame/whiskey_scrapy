3.0,"I picked up this bottle back in September 2016 coming back to the US from Canada.  It was around $60 for 1L, and came highly recommended by an elderly employee with a Scottish accent.  I should’ve known better!  Affordable (and most unaffordable) travel retail exclusives are disappointing, as a rule of thumb, and recommendations by people with Scottish accents do not override this.  At least my wife liked it.  We finished the bottle because she drank most of it.  She’s a Macallan fan, and actually preferred the Robur cask to Macallan 12.  I definitely prefer Macallan, but wouldn’t call myself a fan of Macallan.  WHAT THE HELL IS A ROBUR?  It’s Latin for Oloroso sherry, apparently.  Forced exoticism, another clue for a disappointing dram.  This is NAS and 40% ABV.  Another clue.  NOSE: Underdeveloped Oloroso.  Dark berries, but not too sweet.  Cedar.  Maybe a little vanilla.  Something’s a little off, like sourdough.  Not a fan.  PALATE: Sourdough pastry is actually more pleasant in the mouth than on the nose.  Nutmeg wallop.  Dry prune juice.  Watery mouthfeel.  FINISH: Short and unremarkable.  Same flavors from the palate, dissipating quickly.  Maybe vanilla and toffee giving a late introduction.  VERDICT: The sourdough aspect was the most interesting for me.  Aside from that, this is a watered down generic Speyside that I would skip next time.  74/100."

2.0,"Fail! Honey and walnut on the nose. Heather on the palate. Flat and weak. One-dimensional. 

Consider it a ripoff even if you're offered it for free."
