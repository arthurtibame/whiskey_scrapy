0.5,"Sampled at a tasting event held by the ""Sonoma County Single Malt Society"".  I recognize the irony here.  I should point out I typically do not like peaty whiskeys and this is no exception.  I am 100% unqualified to rate a peated whiskey.

Nose: Peat, smoke, ash, BBQ rub?, honestly this just smells to me like burning plastic.

Flavor: Vanilla, sugar, Band-Aid, sweet and bitter, oak and smoke.

Finish: Tar, tobacco, and barrel spices, medium length.

I hate this so much.  This tastes like what I have to imagine a tire fire smells like.  I ate so many crackers just trying to get the taste out of my mouth and even after half a dozen crackers and several glasses of water a healthy pour of Hedonism just tasted like tar and death.  Blech!"
4.0,"I've been waiting for a compass box bottle to show up in Canada for a long time.  I'm excited to finally have a bottle.  

 I made a small flight to compare alongside Talisker distiller's, Talisker 10, Ardbeg 10, and Laphroig QC.  

On the nose, the peat monster is comparable to the strength of ardbeg initially.  It doesn't have the overt fruity sweetness like the taliskers have, but it also doesn't have the strong medicinal iodine like Laphroaig.  For me, the peat monster is more like a dusty grassy honey than berry fruit.

The palate of the peat monster is actually really pleasant.  The peat is not overpowering, and there is plenty of bourbony sugary sweetness immediately.  It stays a bit dry and dusty through the finish.  46% doesn't punch you in the face, and  it finishes with just a friendly warmth and the peat comes back through as a sweet smokiness.  The sweetness isn't fruity to me, I can't quite pick out the exact sweetness.  

The finish is more like a highland to me, almost like glenmorangie with the warmth, the peat seems to flash at the start, and then totally give way to sweetness.  It doesn't stay on the back of your tongue like Ardbeg or Laphroig.

As it sits open more, it leaves you with more sweetness than peatiness, maybe it's honey-apple sweetness at the very end.  It's not very peppery, maybe mildly briney, but mild compared to the talisker, and the peatiness isn't effervescent like in the other islays. 

It's great, I'm really happy with it, it's not particularly complex, but it is very friendly and refined.  Compared to cutty sark prohibition, the peat monster is much richer, sweeter, fuller, and more enjoyable.  Something about it, even though it doesn't have miles of complexity, it's perhaps one of the most drinkable peated scotches I've had.  Maybe I'd suggest this to someone curious about peated scotch.  Certainly no complaints.  

Cheers!"

3.75,"I like this better than the ‘brown label’ Peat Monster, but not nearly as much as the Anniversary Edition of Peat Monster that carried the same label."
3.75,"Sweeter peat than the brown label Peat Monster, although still very peaty. Just not as earthy or as Smoky as the original. I enjoy both, but the PLPM is a welcome tweak for my tastes."
4.0,"I don't often drink a heavily peated Scotch; but, when I do this is an excellent choice. (If you have tried this in the past and were not terribly impressed, make note John is now using older malts in the blend for more complexity.) This vatted malt is about 2/3 Caol Ila, about 1/3 Laphroaig, and a 1% touch of a Highland malt blend. Nosing gives strong peat and a little sea brine. Nose again and there is a very subtle fruitiness--white grapes? Color in the glass is super pale, like a white wine. In the mouth the peat and brine are forward, but is soon rounded out by the underlying sweet fruitiness. The finish is rather long, the peat going the distance."

3.75,"On the nose peat and smoke, of course, with a bit of iodine/Band-Aids. Relatively light body, with a long, smouldering finish. Apparently this is a blend of Caol Ila and Laphroaig. I'm not familiar with the former, but assume that's where the iodine and lightness comes from since I don't typically get those from Laphroaig. Wouldn't rank it above the Laphroaig 10, but it's a nice change of pace."

5.0,"This is solid.  Not too peaty and has a nice mellow overall taste. Layered and complex, I can taste hints of honey thus far.  Full, rich, and sweet."

3.0,"My expectation were high on this one. Perhaps the one with the old brown label  (Laphroaig matured in a refill hogshead (40%), Ledaig matured in a refill hogshead (20%), Caol Ila matured in a refill hogshead (13%), Ardmore matured in a refill hogshead (26%), and a Highland Malt Blend matured in French oak Burgundy toast barrels (1%)  would be a better drink with Ledaig and Ardmore being part of the blend. Unfortunately I can no longer find it.

This particular whisky has (Caol Ila matured in a refill hogshead (64%), Laphroaig matured in a refill hogshead (35%), and a Highland Malt Blend (1%).)
I am not a big fan of Call Ila which is one of the components of Jonny Walker. And if I want Laphroaig, I will get single malt Laphroaig. 

So not sure what was the idea of creating this blend."
