3.5,"Nose is cream, shortbread cookies, white chocolate and a hint of strawberries. Palate kicks off with cinnamon and black pepper, then turns into honeydew melon. Finishes with tart strawberries and lingering pepper spice."
4.0,Refreshing citrus peel melon like and vanilla smell. Follow by light sweetness vanilla and citrus melon like tastes. Light oaky and sweetness after taste. A good light starter Scotch. Very good value for a 12yr old Sherry Cask Single Malt.

3.5,"A delightful, if light, offering. Citrus taps the nose subtly, and early sips feature little to no smokiness or bite. Rather, a light flavor more akin to vanilla or honey coats the tongue; along with an extraordinarily palatable and smooth mouthfeel. Finish is clean, with notes of a melon sweetness that swiftly dissipates."

3.5,No. 2 on the GR tasting range. Similar to the 10 with no lemon notes plus hint of sherry coming in. Solid but unremarkable.

3.5,"This is a nice, juicy dram that you really don’t have to think too much about to enjoy. The nose is full of juicy raisins and stone fruit. There’s a huge vanilla and custard backbone. Little toasted almond. Some faint nutmeg. Palate like reading a funny children’s book. Simple, easy to understand, but still enjoyable time and again. It was really creamy vanilla and juicy sherry notes. I always get a nice mouthfeel from Glenrothes. Finish was short and to the point. Dried red berries, vanilla, and some oak. This dram was practically refreshing. If you’re looking for a sherry-bomb, or something to spend time dissecting, look elsewhere. This was simple and straightforward, but an enjoyable dram all the same."

4.0,"The tasting notes mention chocolate in the nose, and I missed it initially, but it is for sure there, along with fruity and earthy notes. This is quite a gentle, sweet dram, that is soft on the palate. Citrus elements come through, along with sweetness 8n the form of chocolatey notes. The finish is easy and smooth."

4.25,"Dark gold in colour. 

Nose: Cinnamon and spice with a hint of maple and honey.  Also some pralines and cream ice cream here. 

Palate: Nice creamy mouthfeel. Very smooth with little burn. Dried fruits here - particularly apricots. Some spice ensues with cinnamon and lots of black pepper. 

Finish: Long and spicy.  The pepper lingers for some time and some dark chocolate emerges and lets you chew this one for a while. 

Overall, I think this is a great whisky, especially for the price point."

3.0,"Melons and oaky spice on the nose. Sweet on the palate. Smooth vanilla and a hint of chocolate and cinnamon in the finish. 

On the first sip, it’s okay. But I had bigger expectations. 

Second sip, and as it warms up a bit, there’s more cinnamon and vanilla flavors."

3.75,"Very sweet and very fruity—like no other scotch I’ve tasted before. Without reading the bottle I’d never have been able to identify the banana flavor as banana, but that flavor is definitely prevalent throughout (nose & taste). Fun to try as kind of a novelty scotch and an enjoyable/smooth drink, but not necessarily my preferred beverage."
3.75,"Incredibly fruity on the nose, banana and cream, get the fruit and some spice on the pallet, pretty quick finish"

3.75,Sherry Cask all the way. Hint of vanilla. Smooth finish
4.25,"Bought this on a whim for the quarterly Flaviar credit. Haven't had a Glenrothes before and don't know them to be that historical of a brand. So pleasantly surprised when I tried this. So interestingly sweet the whole way through. Huge flavors of banana, vanilla, and cinnamon. Very pleasing. I haven't tried any scotch quite like this. It goes very well off the beaten path of my homebar, might always have to keep a bottle on hand to always be able to switch up the vibe."

4.0,I guess it’s the reason I’m fond of sherry cask whisky.
