4.75,"Nose : A sweet fruit mix gets you at the nose: apple, candied citrus, plum, abit of mango. This, combined with the traditional vanilla of the Dalmore, makes an exceptional nose!

Taste : Impressive taste. Apples, honey, vanilla, candied fruits, citrus. A real fruit cake in the mouth, perfectly balanced. Its age makes the oak and malt subtle.

Finish: Fruity and short, the finish dies slowly, with an interesting malt impression.

An amazing bottle!"
