4.0,"Like PBM I'm down to a weekly dram or two these days and in fact it may even have been a couple of weeks since a dram passed my lips so this tasted great. I had to look up what Montilla Fino was and basically its a dry sherry from the small area / town of Montilla. I wouldn't say I've been awash in Oban tasting in my lifetime, this is the third after the 14 and Little Bay but I'd say it's my favourite so far. Butterscotch, honeyed-sherry, perfect sweetness and great balance. 4 for me."
