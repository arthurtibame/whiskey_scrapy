3.0,"5th and last dram. I don't see how this one got a 92 rating on distiller. 5 average drams this time round unfortunately. Still you have to take the good with the bad. The 5 dram run which included Hazelburn 13 Olo, Kilchoman Red blew me away (I now have both bottles 😊). Runs like this makes you appreciate the good stuff I guess. Acetonee nose, not hot at all for 54% but then not much going on. Water doesn't help. Zero out of 5 this time round. Oh well...two weeks and Dramfest...40 distilleries...250 whiskies in 10 hours over 2 days...so I'll no doubt find some great stuff I haven't tried!"
