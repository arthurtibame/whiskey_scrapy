4.25,"This is a bottle I didn’t originally know a ton about but was interested in. Not only did it have great reviews but with a sweet looking bottle, how could I not be ISO?

I found this to be like a cross between EHT SiB and The recent Old Fitz 13 decanter. Drank along side Smoke Wagon small batch, Michter’s 10 Bourbon 2019, and Barrell Bourbon 15. I would rank this 2nd best of the night, puting this slightly ahead of M10 ( the higher proof helped) but not the Barrell 15, yo, which is one of my favorites."

It reminds me a bit of oaky, distilled maple syrup with a rye burn on the finish"

4.0,"Neat.  Back and forth of dark and light notes.  Dark notes are baking spices and hint of oak, almost a slightly burnt sour dough.  Cracked pepper. Cinnamon.  Uniting it all is this deep vanilla and a hint of berries.  

Creamy on the tongue.  Equal parts sugar and spice on the tongue.  Waves of vanilla on the finish.  Hint of cherry and mint.  Nice legs.  Solid MGP, but not great MGP.  There is a sharp note of ethanol on the finish that overwhelms and takes it down a peg."
4.25,"Nose sweet honey

Lots of smoke with dried cherries. Oak. Very dry. Sweet corn on the finish. 

Surprised by this 10 year.. really enjoyed it.
