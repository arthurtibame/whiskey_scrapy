5.0,"Now that I can type again (my enter key was stuck...apparently my 7 year old egged on my 3 year old to stick playdoh between the keyboard)...I figured I'd write another review.   If you've ever wanted to smell the aroma of black truffles, this is about as close as you'd get to it without actually buying the truffle  (then again, I think with recent Japanese prices, the Yoichi 20 might be more expensive than a handful of truffles!).  It's earthy.  Damp leaves.  Simply amazing.  For me, a good whisky is 80% nose...and this is right up there with the best!   The taste doesn't fall short either though.  I've never tasted a black truffle (only had the pleasure of smelling it once when I was in a Parisian shop), but I can imagine this is what it might taste like.  Moist, damp earth (in a good way, not in the way when as kids we happen to ingest some mud while playing mud football).   There's smoke as well, but not peat...more like charcoal.  I'm imagining the truffle flatbread, grilled to perfection over charcoals.  Finish is mesmerizing...smooth and supple.   Fortunately, I had bought this ages ago, when prices were reasonable...but, even at today's price, it's one of those bottles that's worthy of a very special splurge.  Highly recommended!"

5.0,"Tried this in a flight with 6 half ounce pours. Others in flight were Hakushu 18, Yamazaki 18, Hibiki 21, Mars Komagatake 30, And Ichiro Port Pipe. This was 2nd to Komagatake 30 with a rich flavor profile of berries, spices, chocolate, and some smoke."
