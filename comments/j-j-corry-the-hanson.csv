4.25,"Nose: Darker flowers like violets and irises. Some tree fruits as well. Lots of oak and grain, not surprising from a grain blend!

Palate: Fruity, seems like a mix of peach and apple. Very sweet and gentle. Some vanilla notes as well with some toasted almond coming through.

Finish: Medium. More toasted almond and vanilla. Slightly less fruity but still there. A quiet goodbye as well; no burning.

Final Thoughts: I’ve been excited to try this one since it was released. From what I understand, it’s the first blended blended grain whiskey from Ireland. JJ Corry bottles are pretty hard to find here in New York so I’m glad to finally have my second bottle and I absolutely love it. It’s very impressive from the start seeing as that blends are typically not my favorites. The flavor works beautifully and the whiskey is pure quality. If you can grab a bottle, do so. I’m on the hunt for every JJ Corry bottle there is, they make a phenomenal whiskey."
