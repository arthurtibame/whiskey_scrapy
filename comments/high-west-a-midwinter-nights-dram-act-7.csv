4.25,Nose full of roasted apple peels right before you get to add it to apple sauce. A little bit of salted butter. On the palate..take all that and add barrel char cinnamon. Extremely approachable with a long inoffensive finish. Ryckman was right. Cheers!

4.5,"Lots to love here! Big vanilla, rye spice, cinnamon, and baking spices!"
4.75,"Unbelievable. I feel like I’m back in France tasting wine again.. A wonderful balance of French oak port barrel character & this lovely whiskey. Hours later & I’m still tasting Cabernet! Definitely not for the purists, but damn this is fun & elegant"
4.5,"Better than The 2018 release, a welcome return to form for one of my favorite annual releases - the perfect dram for the holidays!"
4.5,"Very smooth for a rye, with dark berry notes just a little heat at the end"

4.75,"Act 7 Scene 1. High West sourced (MGPI) Rendezvous Rye whiskey blend, finished in French oak port barrels. 49.3 ABV. Beautiful deep auburn color. Vanilla and stone fruit on the nose. Warm cereal grain, plum, brown sugar and spices, fading into the grassy spiciness of rye, with a long lingering sweetness. Round and oily. Oak and vanilla and rye are all there, but wrapped in this fruit essence that smooths and gives it tremendous depth. 

A wonderful winter dram, a 5 star, but... High West takes a premium markup on rye it sources, blends, (in this case) rebarrels, and bottles. Marketing. I live in UT and love the product, except for the pricing. Their own whiskey... not so great. As more distilleries start making their own superior whiskeys, HW is going to be pulled down by their pricing and lack of distilling innovation and excellence. Take note."

4.75,"Exquisite. I’ve wanted to find this bottle for 2 years, and finally stumbled upon one while visiting family in upstate New York.

And man, I’m so happy I did. This didn’t disappoint and is one of the most unique whiskies I’ve had to date.

Nose: Gobs of sweetness, specifically brown sugar and maple syrup. Undertone of dark cherries, vanilla and an oakiness. It’s gentle yet concentrated, a beautiful blend of sweet.

Taste: Caramel covered apples up front, a spike of cinnamon and an explosion of berries. 

Finish: This is where it pushes itself into elite territory for me. The wine-cask finish (port) shows up and just sticks with you along with this lingering spiciness that reminders me of Mexican Hot Chocolate (cocoa with cinnamon and cayenne pepper, essentially). It rounds into this buttery smooth finish.

Overall: 4.75

Value: It’s about $100 depending on where you are (I’ve seen some get it for less, I’ve seen it listed at $160 online). To me, if you’re looking for something special without paying a huge markup, this is worth it. I’d pay $100 again and feel fine with it."
5.0,"I'm somewhere between a 4 and a 5 but am rating up because it's the sort of thing I'll keep reaching for.  Having just come off a solid holiday week of drinking good barrel strength rye, this isn't what I'd serve to rye snob friends.  But instead it's a crowdpleaser great for bourbon drinkers transitioning to rye.  The port barrel is subtle and doesnt steal from the rye.  

Though worth rationing in the liquor cabinet, I'm making the conscious decision to get through mine before spring and hope I can score another next year."

4.25,"And they’re back (almost) back to form.  Just when I was close to writing off HW Midwinter, they came up with their Act 7, which though not to the level of Pre Act 4, is still pretty good.  

Christmas in a bottle—-mulled wine, nutmeg, allspice and oranges.  Well made —and with a bigger portion of their own juice.  @Scott_E I know you’re a fan—-this is much better than last year’s Act 6."

4.25,High alcohol content! Port barrel finish on the big cube. Easy drinking nothing overly talkative
4.0,Probably the best nose of any rye. Powerful sweetness and vanilla. Shorter finish. Spicy like spice cake and nutmeg.

4.25,"Good rye, but not quite enough to set itself apart from more easily available options"
4.5,"Nose: wine, fruit, mild rye spice. Palate: more of the same. Can taste to port barrel. Low heat. Sweet. Really taste more wine than act 5. Medium finish"

5.0,Perfect. Some spice but a smoothness to it.  A perfect mix of the rye and a fruity background.  Sweet and spice perfectly balanced.
