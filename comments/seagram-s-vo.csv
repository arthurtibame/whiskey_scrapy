2.0,"Not much of a nose, a little honey and spice.   More spice on the palate with a touch of vanilla.  Finish is quick.   Overall easy to drink and inoffensive although nothing really stands out."
3.5,"Nose : soft, sweetish, vanilla
Palate : oily, sweetish, slight acidity
Finish : balanced, quite quickly disappearing"

2.0,"I tried some lower shelf over the last few days and was not surprised by the flavor. This whiskey is almost sad by itself. The flavor is very thin and is like alcohol with whiskey flavor. I does mix well and guess that this is its saving grace. It mixes well with soft drinks and even other spirits. At the low price, it has some worth as a bottom shelf whiskey just for mixing. I may keep it in my bar for cheap drinks. We shall see."

3.0,It's actually pretty smooth. Not harsh. Has some slight vanilla flavor on the first sip. Does not overly burn my tongue or lips.
1.0,Don't enjoy this

1.0,"Bottle #4 from a 12 Days of Christmas Gift Set.  Nose is rubbing alcohol and apple juice.  Palate is rubbing alcohol infused caramel, and nothing more.  Finish is mercifully short and hot.  I'd rather drink cheap vodka, as at least there's no other flavors aside from the rubbing alcohol."

2.25,Well damn. It’s thin. It’s got almost nothing on the nose. But I can appreciate the nice little cinnamon flourish there on the mid-palate.

kinda smooth 
smells like lemons"
3.0,"Wasn't a fan at first but once you add ice it wasn't so bad. Not great, but not bad either. This is something cheap and dull to put in your mixed drinks"

3.5,It’s a smooth whiskey for the price
1.0,Blech.
1.0,"Appearance: The color coming from this Canadian blend is a light caramel. The legs on this one are thick and watery.

Nose: The nose is very faint, probably the most nonexistent I have ever experienced. If you are looking for it though, you may find slight notes of apricot, nail polish, lemon, and rye grain.

Taste: Like the nose, there's not a lot here either. You'll find a rye spice, and with digging, notes of sour apple and cinnamon.

Finish: The finish is medium in length and it leaves a bitter aftertaste in your mouth that stays with you for a while.

Thoughts: If our nation was in another prohibition, God forbid; I would drink whatever I could get my hands on just like anyone else. This dram was exactly that back in the day. And unfortunately, as a mixer and for desperate people is all this blend could be good for today. I will not be getting this again and don't recommend it. I'm sorry Seagram’s, maybe you have a better product that will redeem your name for me. Until then, Cheers!"
