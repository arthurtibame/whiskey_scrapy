This is great but not my style.  I won't rank it too low just because it's not my cup of tea.  It's damn good for a blend and I'd drink it again... on the company credit card."

4.25,Masterpiece of a blend. One of my favourites ever. Must say that in my opinion it goes neck to neck with the platinum version which is much cheaper so i think it might worth the money for the first taste but not for a second cause for everyday use the platinum is overall better option.

4.25,"Had the opportunity to try this completely blind.  I didn’t know if it was a blend or single malt, just an unmarked 2 oz bottle.  

I didn’t recognize it at all so I spent some time with it.  I noted - leather and not much, if any, fruit and a healthy dose of peat.  I poured a Laphroaig 10 beside to get a sense of the scale of smoke and it was maybe a third but definitely there and likely the dominant note. I listed round, rich and sweet in my palette notes.  I listed finish as long (4 on a scale of 1 to 5).

I liked it and I thought it was a lightly peated Islay at about 46 abv.  Note that I didn’t pick up Caol Ila which is how I often identify Johnnie Walker Black or Green.  Curious to know where Blue gets its peat from. Surprised that it was 40 abv, the richness of the dram means it doesn’t need to hide behind higher abv.  Very good whisky."

4.75,"Well the raiding of the Parents Liqour cabinet (really it's an actual bar!) continues and turns up this vintage Johnny Blue. It's bottled at 43% abv which tells me it's on the older side. I've really started to enjoy Peated Scotches and am interested to see how I now feel about this one. Also, the last time I had Blue label it was at the new 40% abv so an curious to see if this makes any difference. Onto the tasting!
And just like that, I am back in love with Johnnie Blue. Upon entry it's lovely honey, toffee, figs and malt with a lovely smoke under tone. The smoke is present but in the background.  Mid pallette adds citrus fruits and pronounced peat and bittersweet chocolate. The finish is endless with oak and some astringency with honey and smoke reappearing. It's an absolute knockout. A wonderful dram. Definitely better than the current bottling. This one is from the early 90s (according to my parents recollection). 
A lot more dusties for me to get to. Cheers all!"

Nose: fruity, floral, honey, dried red fruit, pear, apricot- white fruits, 

Taste: sweet cereal malt, honey, dried red fruit, vanilla cake, mineral/sea note (hi Talisker!)

Happy I got this as a mini to try out again for $20.  I got a bottle for my wedding a few years ago and it was amazing at the time to my novice palate.  As I’ve gotten into single malts and quality blends I just can’t justify ever buying a bottle of this.  It’s good, but not remotely worth the price. For the usual $180+ price tag in MI, I would rather have a bottle of HP 18 AND a bottle of Laphroaig 10, etc.

If you really want to try it, buy a glass for too much at a bar, or find a shop that has the $20 50mL bottles.  I could see giving the mini as a fun gift, but that’s it."

4.5,"I will preface this by saying that there is no universe in which this is such an amazing step up in quality from other JW entries of worth that it justifies the price tag. Now, that being said...

This is a damn fine dram to, say, share with your cousin on the night of his big sister's wedding (which I had just officiated). Late into the evening, the party over and the guests gone home, we sat and he pulled out a bottle of this given to him by an ex-girlfriend's dad. If this was the only thing he got out of that relationship, he did alright. It's classic Johnnie Walker; there are no surprises here. The opening rush of sweet, Speyside vanilla, fruit, and caramel opens up into coastal salty seabreeze and a light bit of smoke - woody rather than peaty. There's a nice little citrus note in with the salty air and smoke, enough spice to suggest good quality oak, and a loooooong finish. This is much more polished, integrated, and refined take on Johnnie Walker's signature style...it achieves a balance of complex elements that is nothing to sneeze at.

And...it's an excellent choice for making memories. The night the Cubs won it all in 2016, or bonding with your cousin who you haven't seen in years and is now all grown up - these kinds of experiences cry out for the polish and easy elegance of a masterful blend like this. Nothing that's going to detract from the celebration by demanding too much attention, but that will perfectly compliment the joys of life with a masterful sense of perfect balance. Will I ever buy a bottle? Probably not, or at least not at the current price point...if this were selling for, say, $100 or so, I might be tempted to bite. 

Ultimately, your ability to enjoy this comes down to two things - whether or not you like the general Johnnie Walker flavor profile, and how you respond to the pricing. If you like Johnnie Walker's sweet-salty-lightly smoky profile, and you're willing to ignore the pricing (thanks, ex-girlfriend's dad!), it's hard not to enjoy this, especially when the time's right for it."

4.0,"Appearance: So looking into my glencairn at this highly regarded blend, I perceive a lighter honey / caramel gold color. Super thin and oily legs cling to the glass walls and don't let go easily; like Peter Parker would cling to the side of a building.

Nose: From the beginning of the overall complex nose one can clearly tell it's a blend - “sparkly” grainy notes shine first followed by a diverse range of notes like honey, caramel syrup, green grapes, pear, moss or sliced mushrooms, decaying leaves, salty sea spray, and light peat smoke. I really like it after giving it a chance to open up.

Taste: The palate starts off with a hot bite, then fruity notes of honey and red apple take the wheel, followed by notes of smoky peat and aromatic pipe tobacco.

Finish: The medium length finish is bitter, like Angostura bitters, though it's not unpleasant, merely unique.

Thoughts: Is this a good whisky? Yes! Is it worth the high price tag? It may depend, but in most cases I'll say no. However, this scotch is very special to me now and I’ll end my note by explaining why. I bought and had been saving this one for a special occasion. That occasion has come to pass and I am so proud and excited to announce... that I am going to be a father! My wife and I have desired to be parents and the Lord has graced us with this blessing! So, John Walker and Sons, thanks for making a great celebratory whisky! Sláinte!"

3.5,"Edit: Having t again after years off. It’s nuanced. It’s got some good smoke on the nose, it’s a little jagged, and he finish is fairly quick, but in between, you get grain, smoke, and light butterscotch. Each part of it stands out on its own and nothing is drowned out. Good stuff that’s still overpriced in my opinion, but I’ll never turn it down. 

Had it years ago. ‘Twas nice, but I didn’t really know anything about whisky back then. Who knows, I might still like it today. I do remember it fondly."

4.0,"Color: Gold.
Nose: Citrus, malt, grain (less than the malt), ethanol (not overly so, but surprising given the low ABV).
Taste: The malt was prevalent, and the low ABV gave this a very smooth flavor. Maybe a bit fruity and herbal, but complimentary to the malt rather than alongside it. It was a bit peaty and salty. It was a little woody and smoky but more like the morning after a fire going out rather than while burning or immediately after extinguishing.
Finish: Pleasant, a smokier version of the palate."
2.5,"A mini bottle gifted by dthom.  

Nose: Poached pears, light wood, light iodine scent, some sweetness, a wisp of smoke, lemon peel, and a little bit of a musty soapy quality like a fallen mossy rotting tree.

Flavor:  Super smooth, some sweetness, a little iodine, more musty wood, and rosemary like herb notes.

Finish: Shorter than I would have expected.  Heavily peated finish with wood smoke and earthy flavors.  Quite a bit of medicinal iodine flavors here and it finishes with an almost rubber glove note that I didn't like at all.

I have mixed feelings here.  I'm not a peated whiskey guy typically and this whiskey has some nice qualities but some really off putting flavors too.  I enjoyed how mellow the alcohol was and how smooth it drinks.  The nose was excellent and lead to a fairly bland initial flavor with an off putting medicinal finish that tasted kind of like when the dentist puts rubber gloves in your mouth."

4.25,"NOSE: Caramel, vanilla, ocean spray, lemon and apple, hints of charcoal. Some dry and wet leaves. Bit of leather and wood varnish tells of age.

PALATE: Spicy right away. Water tones that down. Some sweet toffee, until spiciness intensifies. The grain whisky brings a velvety texture like soft butter. Long finish is sweet and spicy like barbecue. Lingers with butterscotch for several minutes.

OVERALL: It’s good, but perhaps not as interesting (complex) as 18 or 15. Would assume the grain is very aged, but single malts are younger in the blend."

However knowing the price is above $80 for this bottle I’ll take a Lagavulin, Caol Ila, Compass Box, Laphroaig and others in THAT price range over this.

Nice peat. A little more subtle than my Islay favorites (even the Caol Ila) but that’s to be expected. Very smooth and no burn neat (granted I drink a decent amount of Cask Strength stuff so maybe you’ll disagree with that). Something I don’t always get with Islay single malts is the range of flavors. This has sweetness of vanilla and some red fruits and some other fruitiness. It has some nuttiness. The mid palate is where this shines and might be worth A higher price tag (not THAT high). I expected more on the finish. It’s medium at best and doesn’t coat my mouth as well as I would have wanted. Definitely doesn’t linger for long before I need another sip.

Again, THRILLED to have tried this and, with no price concerns, this is almost as good as the compass box no name blend I’ve had before. That being said, the CB bottle is about half as much as this one and BETTER. This is worth a POUR but go get a BOTTLE of flaming heart or No Name"

The nose is fruity and floral, reminiscent of a well aged Speyside. There’s clearly a high proportion of malt here, but the nose is the teaser trailer for the plot twist yet to come. 

On the palate, there’s malt, well aged grain whisky, and...peat smoke! First time I’ve detected it in a JW blend. It’s a perfect whip at the end. Sadly that’s all that endures on the medium length finish. The malt fades away and there’s some peat and heat. 

So the verdict? Is it a quality drop? You bet. If somebody bought it for me or offered me a pour, you bet. Would I buy a bottle? No. No way. $200 for a bottle of this seems like runaway marketing. That much coin could buy a bottle or two of much higher quality malts. 

Thus ends my tasting of the JW core range. There’s some nice pours in this range, but I come away thinking that even the good ones aren’t worth the price of admission. Not stacked up against comparably priced bottles. I’ll happily drink any of them (except the Red. Screw that noise) if offered, but a place in my collection? Not at this time."

The only Johnny Walker that i’ve tried worth drinking. Still not anything that amazing though. Good balance, solid complexity and nice highlights of berries on the nose and rich chocolate and vanilla on the palate. This would be great if it was 80 dollars, but 200+? Forget about it... go buy a Lagavulin 16"

5.0,"Johnnie Walker Blue presents campfire smoke, vanilla, and leather scents to the nose. The mouth feel is thin, with oaky notes of vanilla, rawhide leather, and a hint of orange slice candy.  The finish is short with spice, leather, and a hint of peanut. This is my personal favorite of the Johnnie Walker series.  I’m not a Scotch snob and don’t mind a good blend.  This is a scotch that you won’t believe is blended when you taste it.  Unfortunately, the price point may not be justified even though it is quality."

Hints of light smoke and honey almond fill the palate. Overall this is a truly smooth and pleasant dram. Definitely well above the other Walkers, but probably a bit overpriced given offerings from Aberfeldy and Compass Box at similar price points."

3.25,"Nose - light peat smoke, pear, green apple, spiced peach, brine, salted caramel, sherry undertones, light ethanol burn. 

Taste - briny caramel, mild peat smoke, apple, grape, and other spiced fruits, allspice, toasted nuttiness, black pepper, light alcohol bite, finishing quickly with fading salted caramel and spice flavors. 

Overall, this is a tasty, easy drinker. I read somewhere that Blue Label is delicious whiskey for people who don’t drink whiskey. It’s unchallenging and unassuming and a bit watery, but pretty decent. However, to me it’s not worth even a third what they charge for it. I like Green Label better and it’s about a quarter of the price."

The flavor is of those elements, but minus the orange elements, and replaced with baked apple & red apple peel. Mouthfeel is nearly full, and Johnnie Walker Blue Label has a fairly quick drop off.

3.75,"Some nice barrel spice on the nose with a bit of smoke.  Perhaps some malt and fruit.  Quite pleasant, but nothing earth shattering.

On the palate quite a lot of barrel spice, some vanilla, marzipan.  Nice sherry notes.  A bit of rounded out smoke.  I get some salt and white pepper.  It's quite oily, but I feel like the body is actually a bit thin, most likely due to the 40% ABV.  If they bottled this at 46% or even 43%, I think it would be better.

Moderately long finish with sherry, dark chocolate, barrel spice, marzipan.  Also some malt.  Very approachable and drinkable, reasonably complex, but nothing that really impresses me.

If money is not an issue to you, and you just want a nice consistent drink, and exploring whiskey is not something you have a passion or even real interest in, this is a great go to - it's got a fair bit going on, and it's reliable.  

As a serious whiskey drinker and student of whiskey, I'm not impressed, particularly at the price.  I've experienced everything that this blend does in much cheaper single malts and blends.  If you really want a solid sherry experience get some GlenDronach, Aberlour, or Macallan.  If you want to get all the oaky goodness, look at Compass Box Spice Tree.  Going these routes, you can get a comparable bottle for probably less than half the price.

I do like it, but I've had whiskeys that blow this away that are $50-100 cheaper, so consider that going in before dropping $200-300 for a full bottle of this.

I generally try not to factor price into my tasting and reviews all that much, but I'm taking off a quarter of a point for price.  I think this is a 4.0 if it were $150, but I can't give it that at >$200."

3.75,"Certainly this bottle needs no introduction.  If ever offered, one should never turn down a dram of the good stuff.  However consistently pleasing this whisky is, it's overpriced due to the name recognition.  It is hard to recommend buying when compared to the joy in discovering more unique single malts for a half the price or less."
