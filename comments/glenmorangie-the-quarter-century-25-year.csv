3.0,"A nice whisky, but Glenmo shines in its younger expressions, I think. The gentle spirit produced by the distillery's infamously tall stills is well matched with cask influence at 10-14 years. At 25 years, the whisky becomes an oak bomb. While a pleasant oak bomb, I'd rather buy several bottles of the Quinta Ruban or Nectar D'Or than one bottle of 25."

4.0,"Definitely a quality drop. As people have noted, apple pear and honey are the predominant flavours. It's quite a gentle dram quite wispy and elegant. Balance is good. It's not a dram that blows you away though,  the aftertaste is faint, short with slight tongue tingling bitterness although that mellows as you get into the dram. Definitely not worth the money for a bottle but then again I personally often find that the case with a number of the very older drams I've had."
