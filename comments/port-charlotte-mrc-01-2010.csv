4.0,"Raisins char and crime brulee sugar on the nose, a bit of oak dryness. Warm baking spices with jammed red fruits, a little sweet. Smoke comes up in the mid-end of the sip, with the bruichladdich bite at the end and a long quiet smoky finish, a little bitter. After water, fig Christmas pudding wafts up the nose and fruit opens on the palate with maybe a bit of mint."

4.5,"Nose : Smoke is present, but surprise for a Bruchladdich, it is not alone at the start. The wine finish is unmissable, with an interesting grape and sweetness element. Oak and vanilla takes their place in the long run.

Taste : From the start, there is a fruity explosion, clearly due to the wine finish. After smoke and malt comes back in force, showing the young side of this scotch.

Finish : Finish is long, and dry like a red wine. Fruity in the start, it fades slowly to get replaced by a lingering smoke presence. Water addition reveals more malt and sweet fruit."

3.75,"A slightly funky nose with aromas of bacon and burnt matches. In the mouth it’s oily and syrupy, with a blackberry-infused smokiness. The finish is fruity and feisty. Not much complexity but very enjoyable."

4.5,"Found at a store that don’t know what they are selling since it was not entered into their computer. Ended up selling it at normal PC10 price. What a steal, their lost my gain.

Neat in glencairn
Color: deep brownish copper
Nose: brine, seaweed, salty, nuts, smoke, peat, faint red wine smell, strong alcohol smell gives it quite a rubbery scent. It definitely smells young.
Palate: oily, great viscosity, arrives light and sweet on the tongue, then exploded into berries, red grapes, smoke, ash, roasted peanut and almond. Complimented at the back with spicy pepper, oak, and hint of bitterness.
Finish: very long and warm. Traces of smoke, bacon and nuts. The pepper spices linger. 

Added drops of water
More sweet fruitiness, tamed not as hot, dry, the red wine influence shows.

Great stuff, there’s a lot going on that gives you a unique experience.
This is it if you want an adventure!

4.25 for the spirit
4.5 for the steal of price"

3.75,"Shout out to @barrelraised for sharing a pour of this one yesterday! I am a big fan of all things Laddie so getting an opportunity to try what I hoped would rival the Octomore releases is something I was excited to try! Let's dive into the specifics of what's in the bottle:

Bottled at 59.2% 
8000 bottles 
100% Scottish barley from the Inveness Region
Age stated at 7 years old
40ppm
First-fill ex-bourbon casks and second-fill French wine casks before coming together for a finish of a year in the ‘finest’ red wine casks from the Bordeaux region

Let's dive into the tasting:

It's got a really mouthcoating entry and a wonderful mouthfeel. Initial notes are an array of grilled fruits with BBQ smoke and Ash. Some saline notes. Mid palate adds cherry and toffee with a spice and peat filled finish. A hint of some iodine. Drinks really quite easily considering the big proof. 

In conclusion, is it good? Yes it's very good. Is it worth almost double of what you would pay for the Port Charlotte 10? No, in this instance it's not a great value but a damn fine dram. 3.75/5"
