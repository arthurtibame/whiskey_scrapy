4.75,"Simply delicious, spicy, caramel, medium finish"
4.25,"I’ve been picking up some Ben Nevis samples following my great experience with the new batch of the official 10 year old. This was a somewhat different but equally delicious dram. The nose is TCP, warm tarmac, sweet paprika, Fisherman’s Friend and, of all things, turkey sausage. The palate is minty, spicy and sweet, with notes of baked oats and cured duck. The finish is exceptionally long, with a low rumble of spice and a rich malty undertone. Easy drinking at its bottled strength."
3.0,"Nose: buttery shortbread, lilac, gummy bears and stone
