4.0,"slightly reminiscent of westland winter but easier to drink. has the dark sweetness & a bit of a smokey kick, more than what the reviewer claims.  it fades to a nice if not somewhat short finish.
REVISED REVIEW:  after spending time with it, it's better than my initial review. with the addition of the absolutely yummy stout beer on the finish, it's a unique set of flavors that have impressed everyone i've shared it with."
4.75,For sure you smell the stout. It is way smoother then I would have expected. This is a nice bottle. A little expensive but it has one of those special situations where it is still worth it. I would recommend giving this a try.

4.5,Definitely get some vanilla. Also it’s interesting cause it tastes like a stout but doesn’t taste like a beer. (If that makes sense)
