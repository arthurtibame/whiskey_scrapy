4.5,"Darker amber, almost like weak tea in color. Fairly heavy body that clings to the cup. 

Tobacco, honey, lime, brine, and corn sweetness in the nose. 

Creamy texture complements of the heavy body, sweet with a nice rye burn. 

Ends with a leather and tobacco flavors. There’s a pretty long finish that fades to corn and floral tones. Ultimately I ended up with a cinnamon flavor for a few minutes at the very end. The finish is the best part of this bourbon, though it’s quite good at all stages."

3.75,"I bought this on a trip to Kentucky for the sole reason it was not available out of the state and it was inexpensive. It is actually quite good. Not sweet, but spicy, a little piney on the finish. Very enjoyable."

0.5,Couldn’t even get through a pour. Tastes extremely young despite it being a bottled in bond bourbon. I gave it half a star for novelty.
3.5,"Cheap, smooth, good. Always have this in your house."

3.75,"Nose- dark chocolate and cherry 
Body- dark chocolate and lots of cherry 
Finish- the bitterness that I get in Old Bardstown 90 is present here but less so

This is a very nice one. Simple yet tasty."

1.0,Extremely hot. Almost a woody aftertaste which I don't find pleasant. Wanted to try it because I heard good things.

3.5,The nose has brown sugar and a strong sweet oaky aroma.  As it rests pipe or even cigar tobacco come to the front and each sip brings more smoke and vanilla. Long lingering finish of mint and almost a tar funk. I kinda like it but it’s not for everyone.
3.5,"Pretty hot with a nice, sweet, warming finish. On ice vanilla, brown sugar, touch of smokiness and spiciness. Good mouth feel."

3.0,Nose of earth and wood. Light on the palate. Clearly a high barley mash bill - a little too much in my opinion. Nice rye spice on the finish. Drinks more like an 80-90 proof whiskey. Not bad for the money. May hold up well in an Old Fashioned.
