4.0,"Bottled in December 2014, Warehouse TS, Barrel 37-3F, OBSV mashbill. Nose makes me think of maple syrup and banana. Taste is the same, with some added herbal notes and oak. Spicy. Finish is medium long with lingering oak and fading spice. Excellent value at under $40."

5.0,"Nose: Thick rich vanilla fudge & caramel nougat are dueling it out right from the moment your nose hits the glass.  Green apples and thick red woody spices with some black peppers immediately trail. Spices are intense, just shy of abrasive.  Redwood lumber, dry fall leaves, sugar cookie dough and juicy lemon resonate.  Old wet barrel and some nut shells, unsalted.  Some peanut butter and apricot notes.  Redwood tree bark is dominant and creates a sort of foundation for the nose.  Cinnamon sticks and kindling round things out deep in the nose with a savory hickory-esque creaminess.  Quite lovely.
______________________________________________________________________________________________

Palate: The spice on this palate, like the nose, truly defines this barrel.  Arrival of the spice slightly muted upon entry by vanilla but then takes off with menthol intensity like a 90 degree angle from the beginning of the palate to the finish.  The Northern California Mendocino Redwood Forest in a barrel.  Light piney, earthy woodiness, no doubt from the rye.  Menthol, black pepper and oak on the mid palate and the spice level continues rise as a chalky dryness forms.  Their is a green earthiness that isn’t vegetal that i can’t put my finger on. Almost resiny.  Paper, brown sugar and hickory from nose.  Thick and heavy.  Smoke on the back end with an interesting corn reduction element.
______________________________________________________________________________________________

Finish: Long and very ubiquitous of this barrels nose and palate profile.  I really like that in a single barrel when the heart and soul of the whiskey shines through from nose to finish.  Bold, long, beautifully assertive and creamy finish.  Spices dance and dance.  Im talking Michael Flately in Lord of the Dance.  Black and red crushed peppers with vanilla and mint.  Spice lingers, lingers and lingers…caramel and menthol.

5.0,"My preference of whisky is often a scotch but am open to bourbons and ryes.  Four Roses has duly impressed me on many levels and this sample has me curious as to how much I would enjoy.

A beautiful nose of autumn baking spices: nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves.  A touch of sweetness of black cherries, vanilla extract, toffee and milk chocolate (think Heath Bar) with a bit of oaky sawdust.  Inhaling instantly transports me to an Upstate farm on a crisp fall day.

The whisky arrives with a rich brown sugar sweetness wrapped in a medium body.  As the sweetness subsides, the spicy cinnamon hotness kicks in, but not over the top.  Caramel, vanilla, apple crumb pie, and notes of chocolate.  The rye is a foundation and is the binder for all the sweetness and spice and maintains that balance.

Drying oak tannins and spicy cinnamon, like red hots, finishes this off along with vanilla sweetness, toasted marshmallows and black cherry; long and lasting.

Water, as usual, tempers the spice allowing the sweetness to bear more a dominance.

A fantastic and my ideal bourbon.  A perfect balance of sweetness and spice.  Water is not necessary but does not diminish the quality.  I stumbled across Four Roses in Nashville and have found the have yet to disappoint.  Thanks Ryan for providing me this wonderful sample.  [Dry Glass: Sawdust and caramel][95/100][Tasted: 9/10/17]"

5.0,"""Thanks to Ryan as part of our distillery trading team, I got to sample this piece of sheer art. I really haven't had many bourbons, I'm more of a red wine or Scotch guy...but if I were to convert, these are the ones that would make me do it. This is just a pleasure to drink. Indulgently rich, like the best vanilla infused dark chocolate you can find from the top tier Belgian or French houses. I found religion tonight, and it came in the form of a reddish mahogany bourbon. Thanks Ryan for the treat."""
4.0,"I was lucky enough to get a sample of this limited release bourbon as a bonus item in our little trade group. This single barrel from Four Roses is made with the OESF recipe. It is roughly 11 years old, barrel proof 55.9% ABV, natural color of a dark amber/bronze and is most likely non chill filtered. I believe I saw that less than 5000 bottles were produced during this run. 

The nose is powerful. A huge punch of alcohol right away. Let it sit and it becomes spicy and sweet. Lots of oak present. A corn sweetness is there, but I get a strong hit of rye, even though it's only 20% of the mash bill. It is fruity as well. Baked apples with cinnamon and clove. Lots of caramel and toffee with some vanilla. Very herbal and floral as well. Much more so than I was expecting. It reminds me of a camomile, honey and vanilla herbal tea I used to drink. The more I nosed it the more of that tea I could pick up on. Very unique. More sweetness comes in, like cotton candy stuck to a charred oak stave with pink bubblegum. Earthy/herbal notes again, this time sandalwood and sawdust. Familiar, and yet at the same time completely different than any other bourbon I've had. 

The palate is hot (not surprising at this strength) with the rye spice up front. Oak and more of that camomile and honey tea. Vanilla, cinnamon and cloves. Chocolate covered cherries and caramel apples. After that it was too hard for me to get anything else due to the high ABV. Intense flavors. 

A full bodied mouthfeel, hot and mouthwatering. 
The finish is long. Sweet and sour with oak and tea. 

I was quite surprised by the camomile tea notes. Can't say I've had anything like it before. Cask strength/barrel proof whiskey can be a bit taxing when trying to pull out all these flavors, and this one was up there so I can't say that I would seek this out as a sipping whiskey, but it is very good. It's also very expensive. I believe this one was around $250. Not worth it in my opinion, but I'd never turn down a dram. Thanks to Ryan for the sample. A solid 4. 
Cheers"
