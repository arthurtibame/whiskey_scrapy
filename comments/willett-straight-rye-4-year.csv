4.25,Tasting alone on the rocks.  Very good bourbon.  Smooth and delicious.  Could drink glass after glass.  Highly recommend.

3.25,"You smell the cherry upon opening.  However chilled and let it breathe for a bit, and its not bad.   You do taste the cherry still, could be a bit smoother."

5.0,"Nose is young and ethanol forward with a subtle floral note. Surprisingly balanced for a rye, perfect amount of sweetness balancing a strong brine/olive note."
