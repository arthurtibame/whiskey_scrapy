3.5,"Not bad. Strong to be sure at 111 proof, but surprisingly drinkable neat. Adding water or ice helps a bit, but goes flat quickly. Not bad in a Manhattan (w/ Carpano Antica), but has a bit of odd perfume flavor up front. A dash of Elijah Craig helps with this. It shines in a Boulevardier at a 3/2/1 ratio with a dash of E.C. Not worth the $50 price point, but again, not bad."
