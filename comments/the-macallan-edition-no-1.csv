2.0,"An odd aroma of dark roasted nuts, rubber, vanilla, stewed fruits. It's like combining Macallan with factory by products. Dark fruits, dark malt, and a stark dry smoke finish that is the black sheep of the group. I much prefer the edition No.2."

4.0,"I was lucky to sample this limited edition (which, halfway through 2016 is still available at most retailers, so just how ""limited"" is this anyway?) at the Brandy Library in NYC.  This new NAS whisky definitely sports some aged sherry casks in the mix... it definitely has some of the unctuous red-fruit sherry goodness that you can expect from Macallan's main line.  There's also vanilla notes on the nose and palate... this release really plays like a consolidation of the Sherry Oak and Fine Oak ranges, albeit the scales are tipped a bit in favor of the former.  There's some wood spice on the finish and a medium heat as well, which is likely a consequence of the higher ABV that is meant to cater to American palates for higher-proof bourbons.  The firmly-entrenched anti-NAS camp will cry foul but this is an excellent release from Macallan."

3.0,"Nose: Macallan 12 double cask but stronger? Not very complex as the sherry influence is strong here. Maybe some vanilla, orange peel?

Taste: again a stronger macallan double cask. The spice here is much stronger than the macallan double cask. The spice is a lot stronger than most of the macallan I tried. Nutmeg, oak influence is very strong. Quite dry.

Aftertaste: medium long with the spices and hints of sherry.

Overall not bad, a more spicy whisky compare to macallan 12 / double cask."

4.0,"12/30/17 - $103.99 off the shelf. 

The nose on this is amazing. Vanilla, sweet, really amazing. It’s too bad the taste falls flat. 

It hits your mouth with a rich feeling, but none of the nose is present. Spicy and dry, it finishes with a little smoke and falls flat. 

Based on what this sells for on the secondary market, I’m shocked there wasn’t more to this. It’s good, it’s a very good Macallan... but doesn’t live up to the expectations I had based on Edition #3. 

3.5/5"
2.0,"Uber sweet on the nose of caramel citrus, cherry. The initial flavors lack the expectation from the nose though. Sweet vanilla, and honey in the middle, but thins quickly. Does not live up the type of the talk. A little disappointing to say the least."

2.5,"Fuck you COVID and fellow humans, I have not seen Cottonelle on the shelves for weeks.  Do you know how much a vintage 2020 Cottonelle is going to be worth at auction in a few years?  There are no whiskies that are as analogous to my disappointment with the human race as the Macallan Edition series.

Around the time Macallan Ed 3 was being released, I still had 3 out-of-the-way small local liquor stores carrying edition 1 with probably about a dozen bottles on the shelves between them.  I knew this edition was much less common than the celebrated edition 2, so I wound up buying 3 bottles, one at each store (because I have decency), at prices ranging from $105-120.  I had no idea the secondary market was about to lose their shit for this whisky.  I soon saw prices at online stores go above $500, and a friend was like, “Oh my god! You have edition 1?”  So, I tried to go back to those stores to buy a bottle for him, and just like that, all 12 or so bottles had vanished.

I have an Instagram whisky account, I guess the hipsters shorten this to WhiskyGram, only because my wife wanted me on Instagram to compete with our dog’s account.  My account is MaltyMemories, in case you’re interested.  I’m not giving you my dog’s account, because she’s winning.  I see accounts on Instagram with people showing off about a case of unopened Macallan Editions 1, 2, and even the later editions.  People are snatching up editions 3, 4, and 5?  Really?  It is like snatching up Cottonelle toilet paper.  I would like to have Cottonelle, but I’m not heartbroken buying Kirkland Signature.  It’s toilet paper. 

Macallan Edition series is toilet paper.  I tried to convince myself that Edition 1 is the best, because it is the rarest, but let’s be honest, Macallan Edition 2 is the aloe-infused, extra-plush standout roll of toilet paper that gave celebrity to the series.  Edition 2 had a sensible and realized purpose.  Edition 1 is a bunch of different woods.  In the end, this is slightly stronger Macallan 12 sherry oak circa 2014-15.  Yeah, there’s more wood spices, if you’re into that thing.  This is the most traditional Macallan of the Edition series, if you’re into that thing.  But there’s also younger whisky that makes an unwelcomed appearance on the finish.  And, in the end, it’s boring.  Like Cottonelle, if unopened, you may have next month’s rent, if you can find a sucker; but, once opened, it’s just toilet paper.

Score: 0 (forgettable)
How much does a bottle cost: $800-2000+ on secondary market
How much do I think a bottle is worth: $100 (if you are planning to consume it)."
4.75,"Ok lets do this. During my adventures in whisky live i bought ""a special tasting event"" which involved three Macallans. The editions No.1, No.2 and No.3.

Editions 1 and 2 are totally discontinued and highly collectable. No. 3 just hit the markets in a limited stock, specially intended to get discontinued soon. 

I had the chance to taste all 3, and No. 1 was my favorite. I am not a big Macallan follower but i always say they dont make any whisky with a score lower than 85 over 100. This is a true statement for me. 

Bottled, i believe in 2015, in limited proportions, at 48%abv.

On the nose: Oak but perfumed, Vanilla, Lemon, Chocolate milk. Almost no typical macallan profile here.

On the palate: Toffee, Lemon, Liquorice, Orange, Spicy but Not in the typical macallan way;  A marvelous spicyness with chocolate. A little Oily but Very balanced. Complex yet fine and simple flavors.

Finish is medium long with a pleasant and special spicyness. It is very well balanced and that is its strong feature.

Overall i give this excelent dram a 96 over 100. Slainte!"
