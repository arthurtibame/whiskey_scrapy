null,Severely underrated. Shines on ice and works really well in cocktails. Only worth picking up one sale though.

3.0,"It's ok.  It's a good sipper, but it has no character.  It's a straight middle of the road rye, with the standard vanilla and dried fruit notes you would expect from about any rye or high-rye bourbon.
It has come to my attention, that I had purchased that bottle at a steep discount below the normal retail price (usually $40+).  Even at the price I paid, I wouldn't purchase it again, and definitely not at full retail."
