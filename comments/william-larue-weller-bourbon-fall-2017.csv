4.0,"Deep caramel on the nose, with wood spice and vanilla. A hint of apples as well. The proof isn't apparent on nose, very smooth. Thick legs. On the palate, balanced acidity and sweetness. Lingering spice, coats the mouth and throat. Pecan shells, cinnamon. Great pour. 12/4/17"
5.0,Sweet candy apples nose with cinnamon. Caramel on front with a smooth burn and lingering spice again cinnamon and clove at the tip of your tongue. Very consistent between sips. Wonderful!

5.0,"Beautiful color.  Vanilla, caramel, leather, red fruit.  More red fruit and leather with nice, lingering heat.  Tail of vanilla and oak with some char.  Feel very lucky to have scored a retail bottle, but questioning whether I should have opted for the Stagg instead."
5.0,"PRICE: $100-150 is the “retail” price.  Secondary market pricing is $700-1000.
  INFO: This is a 12 year old wheated Kentucky Bourbon distilled and bottled by Buffalo Trace.  The mashbill is approximately 70% corn, 16% wheat, and 14% malted barley.  The 2017 edition is bottled at 64.1% ABV.
  
  NOSE: 95/100.  It’s a boulangery!  So rich and decadent.  Cherries, chocolate syrup, cake, cake, cake… caramel.  Some leather and tobacco notes balances out the sweetness.
  
  PALATE: 93/100.  I think this needs quite a bit of water.  It’s so-hot-it-hurts when had neat, and it’s quite closed off.  It’s a cinnamon bomb.  It’s cinnamon out of a volcano.  You can easily add about 20-30% water without losing anything.  The spices become more complex, and you get cloves, black pepper, maybe some black cardamom or star anise.  The sweetness is dense with flavors of caramel, cherries, plums, and soft sweet oak.  This is noticeably better than Pappy Van Winkle because the distillery character is still vibrant in WLW.
  
  FINISH: 93/100.  A nice linger of tannins, cinnamon, nutmeg, and dark fruits.  Finish is fuller and more saline than last years… or maybe I’m learning to appreciate bourbon more.
  
  OVERALL: Comparing whiskey to women, because that’s what men do… George T. Stagg is like a woman who orders a strap-on from Amazon.com.  WLW is like a woman who wears a strap-on and lives in the Amazon.  These two bourbons are clearly the best from this year’s BTAC releases, and both are out to fuck you.  But WLW is the close winner because it is a little less straightforward and a little more brutal.
  
  MARK: 94/100.
  VALUE FOR MONEY: This is the only Buffalo Trace product I would pay higher than retail for.  Not >$500, but I can see myself purchasing this without guilt for $200-300.  I don’t expect I’ll ever find that deal, as I’m not a “whiskey hunter.”  However, the VFM pour of the year for me was when I got a 2oz. pour of this very whiskey for $28.  Tip your bartenders well!"

5.0,"Simply put.....amazing!  I have tried many many high ranked-limited Edition bourbons, but I cannot place any of them any higher than this.  While different than the 2016 version, which I love, it’s just perfect, sweet and smooth, full bodied mouthfeel, a little heat, just a bourbon that’s on another level.  The only bourbon that competes at the very top like WLW is Pappy 15 for me."

5.0,"Nose - (w/o water) Intense dark caramel, fruity vanilla, strawberry candies, syrupy cherry coke, hint of leather (w/ water) Softens the initial sweetness otherwise mostly the same.

Taste - (w/o water) Hot sweet fruity cinnamon, cherry coke syrup, dark caramel, strawberry candies, red hots, vanilla dark simple (w/ water) Greatly reduced heat, dark chocolate emerges, cherry coke syrup, cinnamon, strawberries.

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering hot fruity cinnamon tingle, light oak, sweet cherry coke syrup, strawberry candy (w/ water) Sweet dark chocolate covered cherry/vanilla caramel, light leather tannic/bitter, coffee bitterness.

Score - 91/100

Final Thoughts - This is right up my alley for what I really like in a bourbon. The fact that you can get cherry coke & strawberry flavors in a bourbon are amazing and combined with the dark caramel vibe, this is truly a dessert in a glass. The higher proof allows you to proof it down to however you like and since I don't get any off-putting flavors, the taste keeps on evolving in the glass as you sip.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes

Would I buy a bottle? - Yes, but not at the ridiculous secondary prices"

4.0,"Mooched a dram from a friend at a recent birthday gathering.

This goes down pretty easy for such a high proof. Interesting in that there is a sweet and salty element to every sip. This sensation reminded me a really well balanced chocolate covered pretzel. 

Highly reccomend if you can steal a sip off a friend but not sure I would pay a premium over something like a stagg jr.

At the end of the day this is still a wheated bourbon. 4/5"
4.0,"The nose is light, and doesn't betray the elevated proof. I smell cola, vanilla, and a little medicine, with oak lurking in the background. With water I also get candy, yeast, and maple syrup. The finish goes on forever. I prefer the 2017 Stagg flavor profile, but this has great complexity."
5.0,"Sweet toffee and burnt caramel aroma, lovely mouthfeel - a bit coating even, incredibly rich, raw cherries + vanilla flavor. Smooth and pleasant warmth on the way down. Absolutely world class."
5.0,"9.5/10.  Outstanding.  Similar to the Pappy 15/23, but with much more kick."

4.0,"Tasted at Cooper's Hill in Peterborough NH.

I've been working through BT's antique collection. This seems a step down from Stagg. The wood dominates throughout, and there is some maple, caramel corn, and some book binding leather. It's a good whiskey, but not transcendent."

5.0,"Huge cherries, vanilla and caramel on the nose. Caramel and cherries stick around for the palate, with plums joining the party casually late. It’s a flavor bomb, intense as it is sweet. I don’t even know how to describe the other half of what I’m tasting. The finish is long and warming, with all the same flavors finally yielding to brown sugar and wood. Add no more than a few drops of water despite the high proof. Unbelievable all around."

Palate- Rainer cherries, caramel, vanilla, chewy toffee, black pepper, honey

Finish- Long, bold finish with notes of honey, caramel, and intense spice

Such an amazing nose. I could smell this for hours, and definitely the highlight of this bourbon. The palate is bold, chewy and complex. Beautiful flavors of cherry and very vanilla forward. The finish is a memorable one as well, as it lasts forever with lingering spice and caramel notes. All in all, pretty amazing, with the nose being the main highlight for me. For MSRP, it’s absolutely worth it, would never pay $700+ for it though."

Taste: a lot of butterscotch, caramel, oak, very mapley.

Palate - an onset of rich flavors, sweet caramel, vanilla, and dark chocolate up front. Baked apple pie, maybe even hints of cherry with trailing spices. Oily and small heat.

Finish - Very smooth and easy to drink neat. Spicy finish, very rich and long aftertaste. 

No surprise here, reminds me of a rich Weller 12. Lives to the hype, don’t pass it up if you get the chance"

4.75,"The nose is an immediate hit of caramel apples, peanuts, a slight pepperiness from the high proof, with some underlying vanilla and oak. As it breathes, the nose opens up and softens beautifully. The palate is dry and sweet with caramel and cinnamon up front, and the oak and vanilla right behind it. The finish is long and has a dry oakiness with fading caramel, cinnamon and citrus."
