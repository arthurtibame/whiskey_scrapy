4.25,"Dramfest 2020. Top TBWC Dram of the night, the Linkwood 18 and Ledaig 17 following closely behind. We had a good chat about the goat drawing. Apparently there are a lot of goats in that area and people like taking photos of goats or something (don't quote me but i believe that was the gist!). After the last Dramfest my friend and I were very impressed and made a pact to make this stall one of our first stops after a few unicorns. The independent bottlers are often the quietest (excluding Adelphi)..the masses going for headline drams. Very happy they do as we can spend a long time chatting and drinking!"
