4.0,"Vanilla forward on fragrance and taste. Brown sugar, vanilla, and maple syrup and lingering caramel at the back end. Smooth going down and not over powering."

3.0,"brown sugar, banana, vanilla, raisins; hot on the mouth but very smooth finish, spicy up front, homemade liquor taste."
1.0,"Really wanted to like this since I support local distillers when possible.  Aged by ""chipping"" or inserting wooden staves into the base spirit to speed up the aging process. Had some hope since another local distillery, Defiant Single Malt is able to pull it off very well. Very harsh, with brown paper bag taste. I hope I can mix it with something, or else I'm stuck with a $30 bottle of drain cleaner. Worst bottle of whiskey I've purchased to date."

2.0,"When I pulled the cork out I was hit with a pungent yeast odor. It was unpleasant. The first taste was harsh, almost chemical. The yeast smell was overpowering any pleasant part of the taste. It is not a $30 bottle of whiskey, and frankly I think it belongs on the bottom shelf. I am disappointed because I like that they're using grains grown in their region. I've had plenty of sub-$20 bottles that went down with less disdain."

2.0,Nose and taste on this whiskey is very much of raw bread dough. The flavor doesn’t linger at all. It has a slight bubble gum finish.
2.0,"Burnt sugars and alcohol are the first things to spring to the nose from this glass, but after that the burnt sugar dissipates into some earthier notes that remind me of clay. The taste is more burnt sugar, almost like a marshmallow that’s been charred and then consumed. Toward the tail, a few notes of cocoa can be coaxed out with the aid of a dropper if water. My tasting group nicknamed this whiskey “a burnt smore in a glass”. While it is an interesting whiskey, it is not particularly tasty."

2.0,"I could not get past the intense heat from this bottle. I have never gotten heartburn from a whiskey like I did this one. I think there may have been an issue with the cork as it kept pushing itself almost all the way off once I loosened the first time. I am going to write it off to the bottle being a one-off quality control issue, but it is disappointing. I love the TOPO brewery and I want to love the distillery, too."
3.0,"Unusual vanilla oak chip in the bottle. Light, sweet, floral, and then ethanol on the finish. Young, unfinished, needs age. Interesting and well worth trying for the experiment value, but..."

4.0,Technically this is not a wheat whiskey since it was aged with chips.  Smells of oak and vanilla and pepper.   Taste is sweet with vanilla overtones with a woody but not tannic finish.  Mouth feel is full.  Not sure what some others on this page tasted but this is a winner for the price.
