3.75,"Found it at $55, for the price it’s a steal.

Nose: red wine influence is profound, on the fruity side, dry, honey, sugary 
Palate: neat without water, almost overpowering alcohol burn with berries, peppery, then the bitter oak at the end. The wine influence is apparent. It’s dry, tannic, but the high abv is very punchy makes you forgot all the quality of the wine.

with water: it’s much softer and mellow, honey, the water really brings out the oak and the depth of the wine.
Finish: medium, warm, fruity and sweet notes. Hint of bitter and wood.

For the price hell ya it’s a steal, but it is a young 9 yr old unconventional scotch that really tests your palate."

4.0,"The official notes sum it up well. Candy notes, red berries, and interestingly tobacco, not a common tasting descriptor but must remember it. They've done well here,  I dropped a bunch of water in and it opened up a bit.  Good quality drop but I wouldn't say it's exciting. Solid 4."
