2.25,"Nose - strong ethanol, corn sweetness, vanilla, light caramel barrel notes. 

Taste - sweet corn, honey, vanilla, strong young ethanol flavor, finishing thin and quick with dry alcohol notes.

Slightly better than I expected, but still pretty rough. Maybe a mixer, but you can get much better whiskies than this for under $20 a bottle."

2.5,"My first bourbon. Not the best, but not the worst. It is better than some much more expensive pours. Actually, at the price point, it is drinkable. Better as a mixer than it is neat."
1.75,"Mini bottle from VA ABC poured neat into a Glencairn at home.  Nose is ethanol, corn, and peanut shells.  Hint of caramel and oak.  Taste is harsh, plastic, and burnt.  Pretty weak, bitter, thin, unpleasant.  Nope.  6/8/19"
