3.0,"Spicier than the 12, with a pleasant fruity nose and an able body. The finish feels like an Academy speech that requires the orchestra to cut short the winner, particularly because the spice is poorly balanced, but overall a decent whisky."

4.0,"Honey and toasted malt on the nose, and a combination of both fresh and dried fruits on the palate. On the finish, I am left with faint smoke, gentle spice and lightly sherried oak. So many subtle notes here, no thanks to a minimally proofed 40% ABV bottling. Pity."

4.25,"Representing the southern highlands

Nose: oaky and oranges. Tangerine. Honey. Light vanilla sweetness. So distinct from anything I’ve nosed before. Distinct. Almost just a ghost of smoke

Body: super smooth and easy

Palate: orange, pie crust

Finish: short and sweet with just a hint of smoke

Note: this is really good. The nose is so different the taste is sweet. My only fault is the finish doesn’t last as long as I would like."

3.75,"Quick hit: Local whisky tasting in Glen Cairn.  

Rich, deep sweet nose.  Dark chocolate , vanilla, crumb cake and leather. 

Silky arrival that crescendos from sweet to spice, but restrained.  Baking spices of Cinnamon, nutmeg with vanilla, wood spice. 

A soft tingly finish that’s slightly drying.  Vanilla, tea and honey with hints of orange bitters. [Tasted: 3/6/19]"

3.5,"Entry is classic highland malt: sweet roasted malt.  There are some floral notes, but the character enters, remains, and stays subdued.
I have a hard time detecting any sherry-cask notes at all, and oakiness in general is on the low side.  The flip-side to this that the dram is smooth and non-offensive. 
 There is a hint of smoke, and the spiciness comes a little too close to burning than I'd like for a whisky of this price and age, but it remains composed and smooth, nonetheless.
The finish remains subdued, if a little spicy, but it is incredibly long.

Overall, this is whisky reminds me of Canadian whiskey: very polite, but insufferably boring"
4.0,The expert reviews tasting notes are spot on. Couldn’t say it better so I’ll leave it at that!

4.75,"Fruity nose - hints of cherry. Nice fruity taste, slight peat. Extremely mellow and smooth."
4.25,"Lets start from the truth: i am not a big fan of speysiders, and i usually give low scores to aberfeldy which i almost always try to avoid at all costs. Having said that, this is an exception to both of those statements. This one is a good expression. 

Bottled at 40%abv, tawny color. 

On the nose is a classic speysider, or as i like calling them: ""the apple juices"". Honey, green apples, honey Corn flakes, Cinnamon , Nutmeg, vanilla Cream. Nothing too impressive. 

On the palate it was actually a lot better: Red fruits, Cider, Oaky very pleasant and Honey. Finish is very long with hints of cider too. 

I scored this dram like this: nose: 20/25; palate 24/25; finish 25/25; balance: 22/25 and it gave me a very fair 91 over 100 for this good dram. Maybe it feels like an 88 over 100, but anyways it is a good whisky."

5.0,"I rate this scotch so highly because in my opinion there is no better option for a 21-year on the Canadian market. From the box, to the bottle, to the actual tasting of this, I love it.
Picked up at the local Costco for $139 CAD this sits on my top shelf in the box. And at that price I don't have to hoarde it until the queen visits, I am happy to share it.
The sweet malted barley is the star of the show, coupled with honey this is a dram anyone can drink not just the aficionados. It is that smooth.
Update: More recently this scotch has disappeared from costcos shelves and I fear the label may have been telling the truth that it is a ""limited release"". I will have to stop being so generous with this spectacular scotch."

3.5,"Nose: Orange water, dilute honey, malt and vanilla. The nose is very shy when first poured but gains quite a bit of weight after it has rested for a while. Warm malty notes emerge together with a well-integrated sherry and leather quality that is very pleasant. With more time a definite waxiness appears. [The dry-glass aroma is hefty sherried honey and malt with a wisp of smoke].

Palate: A very soft, sweet, silken and luxurious arrival with gallons of sweet orange juice and some leathery sherried malt. The development is meagre when first poured and the whisky needs time to open in the glass before the development's full potential is realized. Once it has opened there are sultana, red cherry, raisin, plum and grassy notes and the same waxiness that is detectable on the nose appears in the palate. The excellent initial texture fades fast and turns slightly oily but thin.

Finish: Short. Malt flavours with a breath of spice that quickly disappears.

The nose is very good but the palate is hamstrung by the low proof and this does not have a long finish at all. Quite the reverse.

It is a very subtle malt, however, and it needs a surprising amount of time to open.  The nose (which is elegant and fine) improves markedly after 20 minutes. The palate also improves but it is criminally watered-down. If this was released at 46-50% abv it would be a magnificent dram that could rival Highland Park 18. What a crying shame.

As it stands it's a good malt but no more. The real shock is that this costs the same in Australia as Springbank 18. Wow.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"
