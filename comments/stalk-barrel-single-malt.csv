4.0,"Some serious cereal (say that five times fast). SO happy to have a single malt in my neck of the woods (Toronto, Ontario region). Visited the distillery and I can say that ""craft distillery"" definitely fits the definition at Stillwater. You can tell they're putting their talents to good use with this one. Can't wait to see what an aged statement single malt tastes like when it finally happens."

3.0,"(From Cask #4, Bottle #279). Very pale colour. First whiff is young Highland single malt, but that's quickly overtaken by huge white grape and ""grappa"" nose. White Mr. Freezies, plaintains, sugar syrup, black tea, anise, barley sugar, apricots? Banana-flavoured medicine (like amoxicillin, I think it's called)? Slightly oily, waxy texture, good body. Soft at first but then the heat builds to a searing white pepper. Very juicy, lots of white grape/grappa, honey, raisins, tea, plums and prunes . . .Slightly herbal finish. It's clearly very young spirit, and still needs time to come into its own. But it's a solid enough demonstration of a work-in-progress (evidence that the ingredients and distillation process themselves are on-point), and hopefully as S&B grows we'll see some older, 8-10 year bottlings that bring everything together."

2.0,Little too harsh for me. It has a strong bite and a spicy taste that reminds me of rye whisky. Not the best for tonight's tasting.

null,Tried this at the whisky extravaganza. Tastes a lot like spicy apples.
