3.0,More seasoning definitely needed. Finishes well but harsh notes on palette.
4.0,"Surprised at the smoothness for a young aged bourbon (~4 years is my guess, based on when Jeremy Irons started his company here in my home town.) 2 friends and I sipped this neat, then with water. Nose had butterscotch and caramel notes. Taste was sweet at first, toffee or vanilla, some fruit on the sides of the tongue. Not much of a lingering taste...kind of disappeared rather than having a finishing taste."
