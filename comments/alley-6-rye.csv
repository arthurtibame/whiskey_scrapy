4.0,"A little bit of brown sugar sweetness up front, but then the spices kick in. Clove and lots of cinnamon. Vivid rye flavor and mild spice on the finish."

4.0,Smells and tastes of highly buttered cinnamon toast! Very smooth approach without an overly bombastic spice spike. Comes off young but well mannered to me; don't mind the finish lingering around as long as it does.
5.0,Agree with the tasting notes but got a little more berry spice from the rye.
