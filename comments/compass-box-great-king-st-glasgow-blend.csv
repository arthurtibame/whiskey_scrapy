4.5,"Bottled in 2019

So, I bought a house.  When I closed, I had 25 days of having both the house and an apartment within a 15 minute drive of each other.  So, I leisurely moved my whisky collection, a few backpacks at a time, until I realized all my whisky was at the house, but my bed was still at the apartment.  I thought about one bottle to take back to the apartment to enjoy after a day of heavy lifting, and I chose this one: Compass Box Great King Street Glasgow Blend.

This is the perfect Scotch whisky.  It’s under $50.  It’s widely available.  It adds peat and sherry to a solid base of grain.  Marrying peat and sherry is like the Holy Grail of scotch, and so many highly touted single malts, from my previously reviewed Laphroaig Lore, to the rarified Ardbeg Dark Cove offer false divinity in the form of apocryphal luxury.  Leave it Compass Box to show us how things are done, at a fraction of the price.

For its price, the Glasgow Blend is a miraculous whisky.  Every component serves a purpose and adds to the glorious, but humble whole.  The Cameron Bridge grain matured in first fill American oak barrels brings a spicy creaminess that is anchored by the waxiness of Clynelish.  Sherry-matured Benrinnes is very underrated, offering a soft, sympathetic sweetness rather than the pompous and domineering sweetness of most sherried malts today.  Finally, the Laphroaig (17% of this whisky!) is somehow tamed; it offers an un-shy drying smoke, but I would not be able to guess this was from Laphroaig versus Ardbeg or Caol Ila.  The component whiskies are of course offered by Compass Box with a little bit of effort, but they could have just said, “These were bottles of water.  And then Jesus touched them,” and I would have been fine with that.

Score: ** (unimaginably good)
How much does a bottle cost: $35-45
How much do I think a bottle is worth?: $70"
3.5,Big sherry up front. Smoke trails behind. Vanilla icing in the middle. Sweetness and  oranges on the aroma. Quick finish. Would buy.

3.5,"As the other Great King Street, this is a blend that doesn't live to the compass box name and can be consider a fair blend for a cheap price. 

On the nose Dry cake, Some grain presence, Dry grass. Nothing to die for.

On the palate Cítric fruit, Prunes, a little Sour and some Dry chocolate cake notes. Finish medium with ginger notes. 

Overall, 72 over 100 is a score that reflects what this whisky is."
4.0,"Wonderful combination of peat and sweetness, rich and with a long finish"
3.0,Campfire blends well with sweet citrus on the back end. If you can get past the initial peat this one might surprise you. Adding a touch of water helps bring the heat down and allows the other aspects of this whiskey to come through. Definitely worth a look.

4.0,I love this whisky. I get citrus (particularly Meyer lemons) and peat on the nose with some vanilla. The palate is sweet with mellow lemon and vanilla almost like a lemon chess pie with some peat going on in the background. The finish is moderate and sweet with more subtle peat tying everything together.

Then, on the palate - rich, sherry and dried fruit with a hint of vanilla all wrapped in a cloud of peat smoke. It's all of the things I like in a scotch, really. And for a bargain."

3.0,"The best thing about the Glasgow Blend is the label. I don't mean that dismissively. It's just that I'm a big fan of Compass Box's graphic design. The label here is fantastic. I'd buy a poster of it and frame it. I wish I had as much to say about the actual whisky, though. Much like it's brother - The Artists Blend - this dram is entirely serviceable and comes at a fair price. Good neat, better in a cocktail, it's Laphroaig-y on the nose with medicinal/phenolic notes and unremarkable apple and citrus in arrival and development. I'm probably giving you the impression I don't care for this dram, but that's not it at all. It's really pretty good. It's just that, for me, when I want peat there are better options available in my bar. Where I think the Artists blend shines, though, is mixed drinks. When you need a bit of smoke to  punch up a cocktail, I'd reach for this. The Blood & Sand, for example, is a great way to use the Artists Blend."

4.0,"With the holiday season upon us and the arrival of cold weather, I get the craving for some smoky whisky. Picked this up in my continual search for under $40 anytime drams.

Nose: Peat right off the bat, smells like a campfire with a hint of medicine like Laphroaig, (no surprise with it being one of the malts in this). After some time in the glass, the fruit arrives in the form of citrus peel and apple.

Taste: Smoky at first but it fades into candied apples, citrus, and some dried fruit. Bit spicy too.

Finish: Fairly long, smoked ham? ginger, sugar cookies, ashes.

Complex and superior to the Artists's Blend in my opinion which seems to get more praise.

This is blended whisky done right. Delicious and smooth for less than $40 bucks! Affordable quality stuff and a new keeper!"

4.0,"In the Glass: Pale yellow. 

On the Nose:  Laphroaig's younger sister. She's got the same genes, but all of the edges have been smoothed out with dollops of peaches & cream. Sweet, smoked vanilla. 

Taste:  Immediate Islay arrival, with all of the other components dominating the finish. The flavor very closely matches the nose with lots of sweet fruit and vanilla influence, but layered over something cereal. A smoked parfait maybe?

Great stuff. This is everything that Johnnie Walker Black wants to be, for not much more money.  Rather than the grain whisky getting in the way of the flavor, as with the JW; here it integrates into the overall flavor very successfully."

3.0,"The only problem I have with this whisky is the value.   It's 70 dollars at LCBO for a NAS blend.  I know prices are going up, especially for peated whisky, but this is just out of control.   Clearly trying to cash in on their reputation...The whisky itself is of decent quality, and actually tastes very good but if it weren't on sale I would have never bought it.  Johnny walker green is far superior for 10 dollars more imo...Maybe not as much peat but deeper and more intense flavour.   You could say it's a blended malt so I shouldn't compare them but they are almost the same price is my point.  and that's aged 15 years!  

Bowmore 12 is a better value and has more peat and flavour in my opinion."

3.0,"Nose: cherry cobbler, cedar, lemons, ammonia, smoked pepper, and an odd (if slightly unpleasant) touch of sulfur

Palette: sweet, juicy peaches linger on the tip of tongue. It dances backwards on the tongue, bringing in a salty brine that reminds me of anchovies ever so slightly. There is a light burn that engulfs the mouth, reminiscent of cayenne peppers, but is quenched by an unmistakable salted caramel note. Sweet citrus notes punch the sides of the tongue, leading to a nice interplay of salty-sweet and spicy-mushiness.

Finish: short and simple. An all too short peated smokiness dissolving into sea water.

The bottom line: a nice sipping scotch! Nothing to write home about, but all around pleasant. Definitely would order again."

4.0,"We have really good whiskey here, much more than merely serviceable. In fact I don't see how there's much to complain about when the price is $37 USD. Stephanie Moreno describes its flavor profile in good terms so there isn't much to add here, particularly the obvious tension between the smokier and fruitier notes - you never really know which ones will overpower your senses. I like!"
3.0,"Nose: Definite but light and restrained smoke backed up by a little fruitiness (apples), some soft vanilla and malty notes. A touch of sherry and there are ethanol notes from the grain whisky component, but they are not objectionable.

Palate: The arrival delivers on the promise of the nose, being lightly smoky and fruity. Over time an apple cider note appears and it has an overall pleasant and creamy nature with a hint of sherried dark fruit.

Finish. Short. The palate just fades away with nothing new appearing and little noticeable aftertaste.

The first time I tasted this was about 6 months ago (early 2016) and I was a bit disappointed. There didn't seem to me much of a nose or palate and I really didn't see what the fuss was all about. Then recently I bought another bottle for a group tasting of blends with some mates and it seemed better.  Maybe there are batch variations?

Tasting it neat is an enjoyable experience, but it's when you use this as a mixer that you finally get the message because it is absolutely, specifically crafted to be a superior mixing scotch that imparts a gentle but definite smokiness.

Given the relatively small bottle size, by volume it ends up being in the same price bracket as many less expensive single malts and also the more interesting Compass Box blended malts, so it's a personal choice as to whether it is worth it. I did notice, however, that while I had this in the house I tended to reach for it automatically when making a scotch and soda.  It has an agreeably light, clean character and is crisper than most other smoky blends.

3.0,"""""** Disclaimer: This review is what I would consider a “Quick Hit”- meaning I won’t have my usual in-depth notes that I usually like to take. The reason: this sample was poured at Whiskyfest DC on 4/17/18. All of these reviews will not be scored and I am actively looking to try them again at some point to do them more justice.

This was the sister bottle to the Artist’s Blend and this one has more sherry cask influence, and therefore a much sweeter profile than the Artist’s.  Both had similar vanilla and pie crust notes to them- with the Glasgow delivering a slightly smoother mouthfeel and a sweeter, vine fruit bite.  Neither bottle showcases much cask influence nor do they offer much in the way of heat from ABV.  Another fantastic, cheap sipper from CBW.  Spend the $40 required, sit back and relax while enjoying this one neat from a highball glass."

3.75,"End of a working week and boy do I need a dram. This one sure packs a lot of components in. Apparently 34% Grain (Cameron Bridge) & 66% Malt (35% Benrinnes, 17% Laphroaig, 8% Clynelish, 2% Miltonduff, 4% Highland Malt (60% Clynelish, 20% Dailuaine, 20% Teaninich)). Maybe it's because it's the 1st dram in exactly (to the hour) 6 days, but I like it. Doesn't scream massive complexity or interestingness but it's well married. And cheap. Ah man Laphroaig I can taste thee. Honey, smoke and other stuff (hint plasticy as another reviewer mentioned?). Leaves a lovely afterglow. 3.5 to 3.75 rounding up to 4 as did I mention.....cheeeeap."
4.25,"Incredible blend. One of my favorite blends for sure. At this price, I would strongly recommend this to any whiskey drinker. Peat smoke, spice, and fruitiness on the nose. Cherries mostly.

3.75,"Non-Chill Filtered | Natural Color. Poured neat the nose comes at you with peat smoke but tempered with some grilled fruit and malt. Barrel notes lurk in the back. This is a nice full aroma without grain ruining the day. Palate is bursting with flavor. Charred fruit and malt with blast of sweet smoke and sooty ash alongside oaky tannins. Finish is heavy char and oak with the fruits and malt hanging in there. Superb blend, grain notes are hidden so well one could easily mistake this for single malt. Flavor is cohesive and deep. You get plenty of smoke/ sherry combined and balanced leading to a truly enjoyable experience. Paid $37 for this and no regrets..........89/100 blend score. Very interested in the Compass Box range now. Better than age statement JWB12 and Dewars12"
3.75,"Compass Box is rightly recognized for putting out consistently excellent blended Scotch Whisky. One could argue they really helped to start to shift the perception that a blended Scotch is inherently inferior to a Single Malt. More often than not the rare and expensive Compass Box releases get a lot of hype but tonight I want to highlight and review one of their cheapest blends and it's excellent! 

The make up of this blend is as follows:

Blend: 34% Grain (Cameron Bridge) & 66% Malt (35% Benrinnes, 17% Laphroaig, 8% Clynelish, 2% Miltonduff, 4% Highland Malt (60% Clynelish, 20% Dailuaine, 20% Teaninich))
Cask: ex-Bourbon, ex-Sherry, Rejuvenated Hogshead, French Oak Hybrid
Age: NAS
ABV: 43%
Non-Chill Filtered | Natural Color

Let's move to the tasting! It's a rich palette featuring smoke, honey, fruit and some caramel. This leads to a lengthy smoke, grilled fruit and vanilla driven finish. Really lovely. All in all it's fairly simple but damn tasty. For around $30 or less it's an excellent value.

Cheers All!"
3.5,"This is absolutely great for the price point.  The nose is nicely smokey with some sweet sherry notes.

The palate definitely has some salt and peat and it's quite fruity, almost like a little bit of strawberry jam.  There is also a sharp, pronounced peppery bite that is a big part of the finish.

It feels a little thin on the tongue, but the flavor is fairly intense and enjoyable and clocking in at just $30, I'd be hard pressed to find a single malt that's as good with spending at least another $15 on the bottle.  Not sure what the smoke in this is coming from, but I wouldn't be surprised if this has some Talisker or something from Islay as a part of it's backbone."
4.0,"They say ""bold and peatey"" and they ain't kidding.  It is bold,  but also quite smooth."
4.0,"For a $30 bottle, this scotch is well worth it.  Great entry into peated scotch."
4.5,"On the nose, chocolate, lemon infused raisins with a spray of salt and smoke. On the palate, cashews, a dash of honey, minty, fresh fruit and a very creamy mouthfeel that wraps up with a little savoury spice. A delicious, if somewhat short finish of smoke, vanilla, oak and salty."
4.25,"This bottle is a Total Wines store pick.

I found this to be a very interesting experience. From the nose, to the taste, to the finish, each part changed from the last.

It starts off with a light scent of wood musk, dried plums, dark chocolate and almond skins. The taste evolves to a sharp, sweet orange zest. It's peppery and has an underlying note of toasted wood shavings.

The finish gets even more interesting. Its like a peppery custard with a bright pop of salted butter.

I really like it."

But, as I kept going back to it I found I really began to appreciated the underlying sweet notes and the changing smoke (not peat) influence. It just all of a sudden became more interesting and more complex then what I initially thought was an unbalanced blend. So, ultimately at its price point I think I will buy this again. Just goes to show that you have to stick with something despite first expressions. Except for Bowmore 15 Darkest. That’s terrible. I’m actually afraid of it at this point and have moved it to the back corner of my bar. And I like the 12 so go figure."

3.75,Picked up on clearance. I'm new to peated scotch so this is interesting.  Peaty and a little rubbery almost.  Nose is very mellow and semi-sweet.  I finally understand the bandaid taste note.  Cheers to new experiences and clearance sales.
2.5,"Picking through my mass of samples I decided to go with something light on ABV tonight. Great King Street Glasgow Blend from Compass Box at 43% ABV should fit the bill nicely. This is CBW’s budget scotch along with its sister bottle the Artist Blend. @LeeEvolved sent me this sample quite a while ago (along with many others) so it’s about time it got to it. There are many different components to this blend that I’m not going to list, but it’s 1/3 grain and 2/3 malt whiskies. As with all Compass Box expressions, this is non chill filtered and natural color, this one is pale straw. 

The nose is very light and delicate, not what I was expecting and not a good start. Faint smoke (Laphroaig is one of the malts being used) and lightly fruity. The grain components come through with vanilla and coconut, thankfully there is no harshness to it. A distant waxiness, and a just as distant sherry note. The whole profile is incredibly light and hard to pick anything out. Some berries and a bit of a rubbery/latex note. The Laphroaig becomes more dominant, but there wasn’t much there to dominate to begin with. Some of the classic Laphroaig medicinal notes and a bit of candy sweetness. A real disappointment of a nose.

The palate begins with the classic Laphroaig signature peat and smoke along with the medicinal, bandaid, iodine and campfire ash notes. All those, but turned down to a 4 vs the real deal that’s at a 10. Faint oak and sawdust, vanilla, grain alcohol and coconut. Ever so soft sherry, raisins/grapes and nuttiness. Not as much of a letdown as the nose, but not far off. 

A light bodied mouthfeel that is thin and watery. 
The finish is short, almost nonexistent. Some smoke and vanilla but that’s it. 

This is by far the worst CBW I’ve ever had. Other than the Laphroaig peat smoke there is very little here of any substance. Almost no finish at all, the nose is too soft and subtle. The only saving grace is the peat on the palate. For $40 there are far better blends and even single malts out there. This might be ok in a cocktail as it should be easily hidden. 2.5 and I do not recommend buying it. 
Cheers"
4.0,"1 yr later... compass box really outdid themselves with Glasgow Blend.  Somehow they fit the entire scotch flavor profile into 1 balanced bottle.
