3.0,"Kind of a burnt fruit and herb combination on the nose. Medium bodied, slight salinity, smoky, peaty. Even more so with a couple of drops of water. Not terribly complex, pretty one-dimensional with burnt smokiness, not getting much beyond that."

4.0,"There seems to be a wide range of opinions out there about this one, ranging from the closest to a negative Ralfy review that I've seen on down to people raving about how fabulous this is. I'm much closer to the latter camp, personally...though the range of opinions suggests perhaps a struggle for consistency on the distillery's end. Nose-wise, the first thing to hit is a big saltiness, followed by dark dried fruit, marzipan (or halva), peppermint, savory herbs, and some lemon zest. The palate is rich and dense, opening with the sherry fruits and nuts, then swirling around into a salty, every so very slightly smoky fog of herbs lightened by that tiny hint of citrus. A fine dram, and one of the better sherry-influenced single malts in the under-$50 (barely) range."

4.0,i found a smooth buttery taste and a wonderful finish
2.0,"I am not sure what to make out of this one. There is nothing unique that it excels at nor does it have any major flaws. Sweet with hints of sherry, dried fruits, some earth like notes, little spice, green apples, and oak. The finish is medium to short.
There are many excellent options for a 12 year old at and below this price range making the recommendation for this one difficult."

3.0,"Good start but it kinda goes downhill after that - the nose is similar to the Glenlivet Nadurra First Fill, with hints of apples and barley with a predominance of honey. The body is completely flat, though fruity (sweet), and the finish is medium in length and not unpleasant. It's... alright."
3.0,"Nice honey and orchard fruit on the nose. The palate is a little more muted on the fruit, with mostly oak coming through. Relatively short woodsy finish. Not bad, but nothing special."

3.0,"I have seen this on shelves and often wondered about this; tempted to purchase out of sheer curiosity.  Decent packaging, majestic name.  Well, the wondering is no more. 

A fruity beginning with a mixture of citrus tangerine, white fruity apples and some tropical kiwi and pineapples.  The sweeter notes of vanilla and caramel are swirled in.  Lightly toasted whole wheat bread provide some  a cereal grains. 

The nose come through on the palate within a medium body.  Apples, vanilla, caramel, orange creamsicle. There is an oaky spice with a dash of black pepper that comes through towards the finish. 

The finish is bitter and slightly drying with a touch of cucumber and ginger that is medium in length. 

This is a good whisky that provides some good aromatics and some enjoyable sweetness. It falls a bit short on the palate and finish and encourages another draw sooner than later.  For the average shelf price, one is better spending on something else, at a lower cost.  Worthy of a taste, though. Thanks @Generously_Paul for the sample. [85/100][Tasted: 6/19/18]"

3.0,"I’m back to knocking down a sample from our Scottish Distillery team:  Royal Brackla 12.  This sample was provided to the group by @Generously_Paul.  Royal Brackla was founded in 1812 and is currently owned by Dewars & Sons.  In 1833, they were issued a royal warrant by King William IV and remain as one of only three ever issued the decree (Royal Lochnagar and Glenury Royal).  They produce around 3.5 million liters per year and they primarily supply Dewars blends.

The Highland 12 year old, single malt is deep gold in color, creates lots of legs and leaves behind large droplets because it’s bottled at the legal minimum of 40% ABV.

The nose is heavy on tropical fruit, apples, citrus and muddled mint.  There’s some lighter oak notes in the background, as well.  The palate suffers from a thin mouthfeel and doesn’t offer much depth.  There’s tropical notes, orchard fruits and a little vanilla sweetness.  The oak is restrained on the palate just like the nose.  The finish is mostly oak, but it’s short and weak.  This one begs to be bumped up in the ABV department.

Overall, this is another one that happily belongs in blends.  I’m not sure it deserves a single malt release, especially at 40%.  The royal decree is mostly a gimmick to sell more bottles, while they should focus more on adding depth and complexity IMO.  Glad to tick this one off the list, but I’m not a big fan.  3 stars.  Cheers."

3.0,"Stop number 91 on the SDT is Royal Brackla, or as my wife calls it, Count Brackula. A Highland distillery that once upon a time was granted a royal warrant by King William IV, the first royal warrant for a distillery ever given, and they’ve been calling themselves “Royal” ever since. Let’s see if it’s a worthy title. 

This 12 year old single malt is bottled at 40% ABV and is chill filtered with colorant added creating an orange amber color. These do not appear to be stats worthy of royalty. 

Light fruitiness at first on the nose, but the more time you spend with it the more pronounced and defined the fruits become. Kiwi, pineapple tangerines and lemongrass. Very citrusy. Wet hay, mint toothpaste, oak and furniture polish. A sourdough bread note and there’s a phenolic or aromatic note that could be a light earthy peat and a whiff of smoke. Mineral/gravely notes, seashells, earthy/vegetal and new leather. Herbal notes like bay leaves. Creamy and a touch malty, vanilla and spicy oak, black tea and wood sap. After all that there are vague bourbon and sherry notes that just linger for a while with more of those mineral and citrus notes. Surprisingly complex, but not all that impressive. 

The palate has tropical fruits of pineapple and kiwi, tangerines and lots of citrus. Light peat, or what is passing as peat to me. Slightly bitter oak and some wood spices. Vanilla and cantaloupe oddly enough. Mineral notes like on the nose. Hints of sherry, but very light, this is definitely a majority of ex bourbon casks. 

Light to medium bodied mouthfeel, mouth coating and semi dry. 
A medium length finish, aromatic, oak, tea, citrus and a touch of bitterness. 

I really was expecting much less than what I got, but that’s not to say that what I did get was spectacular. It took me a while to get used to the profile, and with the better half of a 1L bottle that wasn’t hard to do. The mineral notes reminded me of a Mortlach or a Springbank or Craigellachie, but the fruitiness really helped to balance it all out. In Michigan this goes for $72 for a 750mL bottle, which makes me glad I paid $70 for a full liter at duty free. Neither purchase is worth the price, but the bargain made it a little easier to swallow. I would not buy this one again and after hearing similar reviews about the 16 I doubt I would buy any other Bracklas in the future. 3.25, and no, the “royal” moniker is misplaced here. 
Cheers"

2.0,"After 2 attempts tonight, both of which I couldn’t get past 2 sips...hoping for a success on this one.  Courtesy of @Generously_Paul , as part of our SDT.  Starts off well, with aromas of apples and whole wheat bread.  Goes south quickly past the aroma into palette.  0-3 this evening.  This is one of those that needs to be on the finance guy’s radar there at Royal Brackla to see if it should be shut down."

3.75,"Fabulous Twins liquor sale purchase at $43. Royal warrant issued by King William IV in 1833 made this the Kings own whisky. Finished in Oloroso sherry butts for complexity this is a sought after single malt. Poured neat, nice sweet notes. Bubble gum, banana, malt, light tropics and gentle wood. Some mild spice sneaks in too. Palate brings the same with sweet gummy malt taking center stage followed by tropical fruit, Christmas like spice and wood trailing off. Not the deepest flavors but quite delicious. Reminds me a lot of Aberfeldy 12 combined with Old Pulteney profile with more complexity. Finish is drying sherried malt and wood with a hint of smokiness and bubble gum. This is very tasty scotch with a great historical story that I really enjoyed. At normal price points not sure I would rush to replace my bottle but undeniably delicious scotch..........88/100"

However the much better Highland Park 12 is available for a few dollars less so I can't give this more than 3 stars."
