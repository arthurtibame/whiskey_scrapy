4.0,"On nose the intensity is medium, and has wine with red berries characters, peaty like usual bowmore

Palate is soft on first second but the strong alcohol sensation quickly comes up, peaty, wine continues to have a strong presence, a little bit of chocolate

On finish the alcohol sensation lasts quite a while with the wine taste lingering for long"
