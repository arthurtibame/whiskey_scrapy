Sweet notes of dark berries, chocolate and a whole lotta cab/Port on the nose. Palate reminds me of the new basil Hayden dark rye but a little tamer. Reminds me of drinking a nice red wine while eating those raspberry dark chocolates they give ya at Arrington Vineyards but with a hotter finish of course. I really enjoyed this and think it’s definitely worth the buy but I’m biased a little because I also enjoy a nice glass of cab/port as well. It’s definitely a unique bourbon that I think you’ll either love or hate."

3.0,"Nice barrel finished Bourbon. Smooth and sweet with a definite pronounced dry oak finish. Upon entry it classic Bourbon. Vanilla, brown sugar and caramel. Some spice on the mid pallette with a little long wine oak and vanilla finish. Finish goes on for a long time but is rather drying like a nice Cab.
My main gripe and why I didn't score this bourbon is the price. At $80 it's simply not worth the $40 premium on the standard release. When you consider an extra $9 gets you the vastly superior Midwinter Dram, it puts this one into perspective."

4.0,"Dried cherries and slight fig on the nose. Dark red tint for color, and has more wine characteristics for taste"
4.0,Big good smelling nose with lots of bright jammy fruits and citrus notes. The body and finish is a little disappointing being a speciality cask finish. The groth cask finish variation to me is much more well balanced and flavorful than this Pritchard cab finish.
3.5,"N: honey, stone fruit, sourness

3.25,"Ice from Anthony Davis in COB (Jon acquires and shared). Not much on the nose, very sweet initial taste with an awkward finish (turned out to be the wine barrel finish). Would drink again and consider getting a bottle.

3.75,"A big blast of cabernet wine, oak, tannic notes and balsamic in the nose.

The flavors in there are complex, that wine finish is present. Chewy mouthfeel gives way to cherries, baking spice, oak tannins, and black olives. Yes black olives, was hard for me to place but in sip 3 I got it.

Finish is nice. Mouth coating and sweet for being a wine finish. This begs you to go back in with its complexity and finish."

4.0,Sweet with a very round mouthfeel and fresh berry & brown sugar sweetness. It is nice but not as good as the Yellowstone wine barrel finish.
3.25,"Aroma: wine grapes, dried cherries, dark berries, figs, vanilla, and slight chocolate. Sweet and fruity.

Taste: Quite full/chewy. Taste the cabernet/grapes. Pretty much all the notes in the aroma are present in the taste, although I can taste some brown sugar, butterscotch, allspice, and honey too.

Finish: Very smooth, tiny burn in the back of throat. Can really taste the cabernet/grapes.

This whiskey is okay, but it's definitely not worth the price. Perhaps those that like sweeter stuff would like this, but I feel there's not enough oak and too much sweetness that's not balanced out. Also oddly very bitter upon finish."

3.0,"Sweet aroma on the nose. The Cabernet casking is front and center. Ripe berries, grapes and honey with vanilla overtones on the nose. A rather thin texture given the richness of its scent. Cinnamon and oak on the palate. Where the smell is sweet the taste is spicy and dry. Pretty smooth, the spice is in the taste not a burn. A minty taste on the finish."
4.0,Really good stuff and the finish comes through quite well. I’m not convinced it was worth the extra cost but it is delicious and I don’t use cost for my ratings.

4.25,"This is the red wine finished division of my barrel finished bourbon bracket. This was a blind taste test between Jefferson’s Pritchard Hill and Bardstown Phifer Pavitt. No spellchecking devices were harmed in the making of this review.

This was a slaughter. A truly unfair fight. Like Norte Dame v Alabama in a college football championship. Bardstown blew away Jefferson’s in every conceivable category, but unlike Norte Dame football, this wasn’t because Jefferson’s was bad. Bardstown was just truly exceptional. If it doesn’t win overall, I’ll be exceedingly surprised. Bardstown moves on against the winner of Slaughterhouse vs Hooker’s House. And yes, I am quite proud of that dictionally pleasing pairing. I’m literally flexing in my kitchen right now.

The tasting of Jefferson’s:

After trying the rum and Sauternes finished Jefferson’s reserve variations, I felt confident coming in that the red wine influence in this little guy would be an afterthought, if even detectable. The flavor profile for Jefferson’s reserve is just so damn opinionated, that it would take a lot to overpower it, right?

Wrong.

The nose is Jeffersonian to be sure. I get grape jelly, red pit fruits, and gummy bears. There is a noticeable difference to this nose however. I’d say someone took the dials on those scents and recalibrated. Synthetic sweetness via gummy bear was toned down, and natural sweetness via cherries and grapes turned up. I very much prefer this nose to that of Jefferson’s Reserve.

Body is a bit of a letdown. I was hoping to get a noticeable shift here too, but I couldn’t detect it. If you like Jefferson’s Reserve, you’ll like this body. Overall impression is grape jelly and gummy bears.

The finish did not disappoint! The overtly sweet body is completely removed on the first exhale. The dryness from the red wine influence is very noticeable, and I genuinely love it. Unmistakeable Cabernet flavor as well. Delicious.

This is my favorite Jefferson’s product to date. Any complaints I have about Jefferson’s Reserve’s flavor profile is toned down, replaced with an influence from red wine which I find genuinely enjoyable. I may not have any Jefferson’s on my shelf in the distant future, but if I do, I’d bet a pinky toe that it’d be this one."

3.75,"There’s a few general rules or tenets in today’s life that we should live by: 
1) wear a face mask when stepping out where there’s public 
2) keep your 6 ft distance from others.  The risk isn’t worth the possible pain
3) don’t listen to folks , who couldn’t even pass basic high school biology, act as if they know what’s best when it comes to CV19
4) do NOT follow people jogging, and shoot them.  Regardless of race and creed!! 
And 5) do try a bourbon finished in good quality wine casks.  It’s so worth the experience 

This one is sent by my buddy @LeeEvolved.  ( side note: Lee—-i hope you’re taking it easy at home and recovering from that CV19 hell).  

This is a blend of 3 sourced bourbons, finished in Pritchard Hill Cabernet Sauvignon.  It’s 15yr old stock, finished in the wine barrel. 15 yr + now explains the price tag.  I wasn’t impressed with this as I was with the earlier Groth reserve.  This has tannic flavors up front, and seems like the wine is fighting with the bourbon.  But once you get past those tannins, you get the classic berries and oak soaked fruit flavors.  

Is it worth the $100-120?  Honestly...I’d rather get the Groth over this.  But I’m guessing the Groth as long since been sold out.  Either way, one thing for sure: you have to put red wine finished bourbon on your try list, preferably ones finished in high quality wine like the ones made by Groth or Pffifer Pfavit ( Bardstown ).  
Thanks for the pour Lee—I hope you’re feeling better !"
