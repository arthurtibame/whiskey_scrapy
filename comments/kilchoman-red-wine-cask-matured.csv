4.0,Fascinating. Feels like a lot is going on but clearly this is a spicy and peaty dram.
4.0,"Red fruit, salt, leather, oak nose. Fruits and spice give a menthol sensation. 
Nose opens up into nuts after water with a hint of chocolate. 

Fruit, spice, leather on the tongue. Definite chocolate after adding water. Spice tones down. Fruit smoothes out as well."

4.0,"I was searching through the forest of samples that have piled up over the last 8-10 months and found this extra from our SDT’s fifth round:  Kilchoman Red Wine Cask Matured.  This one was supplied by our newest member, @Telex.  I’ve been a big fan of Kilchoman since their stuff has started hitting the shelves, so let’s see how this one stacks up...

It’s a beautiful, shiny copper in the Glencairn and doesn’t really make many legs when you spin it up.  It appears really oily even though it’s on the heavy ABV side at a nice, round 50%.

The nose starts out smoky, rich and salty like the early stages of a slab of your favorite meat in a smoker.  There’s a welcoming blast of red berries and brown sugar before fading and revealing light, charred oak.  The palate is hot and salty, BBQ smoke with some rich chocolate sweetness.  I don’t get the wine aspect as well here, and I’m thinking it’s because of the high ABV and salt.  It’s still mouth watering and delicious- it’s just the wine flavors I were expecting couldn’t fight their way through.  Slightly disappointing, but I won’t ding it just yet.  The finish is spicy and peppery.  It’s long and eventually drying, but at the very tail end I get some residual grape and blackberry jam stickiness that just lingers on and on.  It’s the redemption from the wine cask fail on the palate and it works so well here.  The heat starts to fade and, as if on cue, the berry sweetness is left hanging there.  It may the best finish of any Kilchoman I’ve had.  Wonderful.

Overall, this is another great Kilchoman.  When these guys get some serious age statement bottles out there the other guys on Islay better watch out.  Quality, quality juice.  Thanks again to Jason for the pour and this is a solid 4-4.25 star dram.  Seek it out and see for yourself, my friends.  Cheers."

4.5,"I have yet to taste a bad Kilchoman. The youngest of islay distilleries, at least to put whisky on the shelves, has proven me, on my third expression ever tasted, that they know how to make wonderful drams. 

This is the case of this young whisky, which was distilled on 2012 and bottled on 2017, using only red wine casks to mature it, and bottling it at a 50%abv strength. The first result of this type of maturation is wonderful chesnut color on it. 

Lets get to business, 

On the nose, it is a prophecy of what is going to come in the palate. Peat, grassy peat. Earthy. But just for a second. Then a sweet explosion comes to the game. Red fruits, cherries, strawberries. Herbal peat and rosemary. After first sip, sweetness intensifies into this maraschino cherry syrup, blackberries and starwberry notes.

On the palate, it is a very interesting dram. On the middle of the tongue you'll get cherries and cinnamon, but surrounded of gun powder, sulphur and ashes. It all happens at the same time but in different parts of the tongue. 

The aftertaste, is also great. Smoky, super pleasant, but it definitively doesn't feel like 50%abv. Prune peel. Powerful salt and beach profile. 

Overall this is a very delicious dram, as well as an interesting one. Very balanced, 23 points on each criteria, makes this a 92 over 100. Sláinte!"

4.5,"Damnit I got lazy with tasting. Haven't had any whisky in months. I blame the unusual high temperatures for that. Sometimes you are just not in the mood for a drink. 

Got time today, so I picked something at random. Mostly. Didn't want to get back into the game with a peat bomb or something north of 65%ABV, and this one is somewhere in between. Shame it is sold out everywhere, but yeah. 

The nose has a pleasent peat note that you expect from Kilchoman. Enough to be noticed, but not so much that it burns out your brain just from sniffing it. That's what Laphroaig is for. There is also a salty air to it, a load of stewed prunes that you kinda expect with red wine casks, an interesting wiff of cinnamon and nougat chocolate. Almost like those plums that are drenched in rum and covered in dark bitter chocolate if you know them. 

The taste is pleasently complex, and also kinda weird. In a good way. Reading off my notes, some of those flavors don't sound like they should work together, but for some reason they do. Peat, salt and dark fruits up front, so far, so good. Honey cereals take a bit of a back seat, but are still very clearly there. What is really damn weird are the spices and herbs that are in between the other tastes. Pepper ok, that's the peat usually...but oregano and basil is not something I expected. Gives it a nice fresh edge. Interesting. 

The aftertaste is peppery honey with salt and touch of fruit. Doesn't last all that long. 

All in all, Kilchoman gets it right. I usually prefer their offerings that got close to any sort of (foritfied) wine cask to their others. This is no exception. 

And now, back to another couple months of tasting hibernation. Probably. Gonna be back with an andvent calendar at the latest tho. Some traditions are worth keeping alive. Cheers."

5.0,"I'm in love! Nothing but adoration for this dram. The nose brings fantastic peat, pork belly, bacon, caramel, fat sizzling on a wood stove. The Douro Valley cask is very nicely present here.  Floral properties like roses show up in time. Coastal brine and a sweet tomato too.... Wow! The palate brings smoked barbecue, balanced with the sweetness and a lot of peat remains. Even at 50%ABV, it's not hot. A couple drops of water on it will not kill it either. Reminiscent of a Lagavulin 16 blended with a Glendronach 15. I don't know what Kilchoman is doing to make a younger whisky taste like this, but kudos to them. I have to give it a 4.75. This finish is long and  has sherry notes, woody tones, earthy peat and campfire. The theme of this dram is ""Magic"" by The Cars. What a classic!"
4.5,"Ah the great Kilchoman run at my favourite whiskey bar continues. For just over $20USD I got to try this, Hazelbank 13 yr Olorosso, Springbank local barley 11 year and a 2004 Connoisseurs choice. Outstanding as none disappointed.  What I like about this place is you can keep a list of what you want to try pop in and ask them. This one they had just got in, it wasn't even on the bar floor and the staff themselves hadn't tried...after they got it out of storage and I got stuck in a few more joined me :-). It was a tough choice between the Hazelburn and the Kilchoman. Both were great, I got a faint ashy hint, red wine berries from this one. Goes for $90USD here which is fair. Not sure if I prefer this or the sanaig. Call it a tie. 4.5 I'll give it."

4.0,"Absolutely delicious, with orange rinds and berries on the nose. The palate is winey and briny in a way that is unpredictably satisfying, with a finish that is long and balanced.

Worth your try."
5.0,"Feis Ile 2018 update.  Another day, another dram (or four, or seven).  This was another pour sampled at Islay House Hotel and ... wow.  This is quite something.  It reminded me instantly of Ardbeg Dark Cove, an equally complex combination of sweet, dark fruits (plums), savory meats (ham, or bacon), salt, spice, and smoke.  At the end, right on the swallow, an unexpected flourish of ripe raspberries overtook my palate.  This dram outshined Lagavulin’s Feis Ile 2017 bottle and SMWS Laphroaig special release for 2017, a 21-year old single cask, both of which we tried on the same night.  So, yeah, Kilchoman did something right here."
4.0,"Sweet, strong, fiery, salty air, slightly floral nose, a little nutty with hints of coffee & dark chocolate"
4.0,"Sixth sample of a 7 part Kilchoman (custom) sample set my wife got me for my birthday. 
Kilchoman must definitely be the distillery I’ve tasted the most expressions off by now, but so far I’ve yet to try one that failed to impress. 
This Red Wine Maturation again is great. 
One the nose, a earthy, meaty smoke is accompanied with some fruity tones. 
The palate is also sweet, and round, and reminds me of steak and wine. Doh. 
Combined with a medium aftertaste dram this Kilchoman scores a solid 4 stars for me. 
Being very much into all things Italy, it makes me wonder how a Kilchoman matured in Bolgherian Sassicaia wine barrels would be."

4.0,"Machir Bay was my introduction To Kilchoman and I was shocked by the quality within the 4 year youthfulness.  Since then I have been a fan.  Having several samples and bottles, they have produced more quality whisky than not.  Now, thanks to @Telex, I can try one more. 

The peat aromas are not smokey but earthen and boggy soaked in a salty-sweet maritime brine. Maraschino cherries, Challah bread vanilla’d French Toast in maple syrup, and cigar tobacco. 

The palate is sweet but not overly done arriving in a medium weighted body.  Sweet BBQ sauce on smoked baby-back ribs with citrus zest. A fruity, raspberry jam fills the body of the palate as it draws to the finish. 

The finish is drying and with a touch of peat, marmalade and Concord grapes though it’s somewhat short in length.

A very enjoyable dram. Easy to sit back and sip.  This is perfect as a perfect after dinner cordial following a rich meal given its sweet, light nature.  Kilchoman is proving themselves as quality distiller.  If only the price was more approachable (but nowadays I find myself saying that about every whisk(e)y.   Again, thanks @Telex for bringing this to the group. [89/100][Tasted: 3/31/18]"

4.0,"I’m sure many of you have noticed all of the review transfers I’ve been doing over the past few weeks. This has been an effort to try and even out my totals between the two apps I use. I started out on Barreled at least a year before here. I’ve gone about as far as I can but there are some bottles that just don’t exist here yet. Anyways it was all leading up this this review, number 200 when counting on Barreled. 

Well ladies and germs, I have now reached the 200 review milestone. For this occasion I have chosen another bonus sample from my friends in the Scottish Distillery Tour group. The Kilchoman red wine cask matured. A NAS from the newest Islay distillery (newest with product on the shelves anyway). It is matured entirely in casks that held red wine from Portugal, but not Port wine. Port wine is fortified with brandy and this wine was not. 

Bottled at 50% ABV and it is non chill filtered and natural color of a dark copper. Only around 10,000 bottles were released worldwide. 

The nose is a little closed off at first, even after 10 minutes sitting in the glass. Nothing but a little peat and a vague sweetness. I gave it another 5 minutes and the sweet red wines notes started to emerge along with some mint and an earthiness. Light honey and florals. Thick fruity notes follow. Raspberry and blackberry jams and plums. Subtle notes of toffee and chocolate, brown sugar and some maple. 
Water brings out some oranges, tangerines and some light tobacco notes. A little more water brings out more florals like lavender and more mint. 

The palate has peat, but it’s lighter than I have come to expect from Kilchoman. A dark fruitiness behind that peat. Mixed berry jam, red grapes, a touch of oak and dark chocolate. Red wine notes with a little orange rind. Kind of like a sangria without the rum and added sugar. 
Water brings out more sweetness but not more flavors. 

A medium bodied mouthfeel, a touch watery but it’s mouth coating and turns dry. 
The finish is medium long with a light peat and wine notes and a distant mint. 

Pretty good stuff here, but honestly I was expecting a little more. I had to coax the flavors out instead of being smacked in the face with them. Perhaps if this was finished with a strong Oloroso cask it would have given it that extra oomph I was hoping for. Still this is good whisky. $110 good?  Maybe. Still, not a bad choice for number 200. 4.25 and another thanks to @Telex for the sample. 
Cheers"
5.0,"Absolutely deliciously sinful.  Thanks to @Telex for a bonus sample in our trading team.  This is layers of bacon, brine, dark fruits.  The red wine really adds a nice dimension here.  I think Kilchoman is probably one of the few distilleries that I’ve consistently given a 4 or 5 ( along with Springbank, Macallan, and Ardbeg).  I had only a sample, but I’m definitely going to look into getting a full bottle."
