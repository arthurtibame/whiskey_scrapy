5.0,Aged in port casks. has a fruity taste and no after-bite.
1.0,I was greatly disappointed.  This rye is flowery.  Maintains a very poor sweet after taste.  Not a good rye at all.  I drank half the bottle and poured the rest down the drain.

3.0,An unusual herbal-grassy nose and flavor until the rye rears up and bites you. This one is best with water or ice added.

3.0,Good rye for the cost. Some sweet notes and a good burn. I think this rye is young but aging their whiskey in quarter barrels allows them to produce a good product in a shorter amount of time. I am excited to see what Dad's Hat releases in the future. If you're in the Philadelphia area this is a fun distillery to visit.

4.0,"Dads Hat Pennsylvania Rye whiskey is an attempt to recreate the Rye whiskey style that was distilled in Pennsylvania before Washington (the President that is) put down the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. This Pennsylvania or Monongahela style Rye is America's first indigenous distilled spirit. A great article about the history of Americas Rye whiskey can be found at https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-pennsylvania-rye-whiskey-lost-its-way

But on to the tasting. This whiskey is bottled at 45% ABV. Dads Hat is made from a mash bill of 80% Rye/5% malted Rye/15% malted barley. NO CORN!! This lack of corn is apparent in the palate of this dram: there is little to no sweetness. It is a medium/dark amber in the glass. It produces a thick oily coating on the glass, only grudgingly giving up some long legs. There is no age statement beyond ""minimum 6 months"". It is reported that Dads Hat uses 15 gallon casks for aging, resulting in significantly faster aging. It is evident in the tasting of this dram; it comes off as more like a 3-4 yr old. 

The nose of this whiskey is RYE! Like Rye bread with dark honey. There is orange marmalade, the bitter kind with Seville oranges. Hints of cherry cough syrup. Also a very slight alcohol burn with some oak char. 

The palate is very different: woody, spicy, leather, malted cereal. There is little to no sweetness. None of the typical bourbon flavors of vanilla and caramel. It has an oily mouthfeel. Water enhances the malty/cereal tones. 

The finish is a little hot at first with a dry oak spice flavor lingering. This is a truly different whiskey. It has little to nothing in common with most of the ryes you find on the shelf of your local liquor store. It runs $45-50 online. I don't know if I would keep this bottle as a staple, but it is definitely worth trying as a testament to the history of American spirits. Solid 4.0/5. Cheers!"

4.0,"For rye lovers. The nose shows sweet cherry, Mexican vanilla, orange spice. The first taste hits with a little wood, a sharp edge, perhaps some faint cherry, followed by green peppercorns. No corn sweetness nor butter here. Finish is dry and strong, with lingering semi-bitter dark chocolate, grassiness, dry leaves, and the rye alcohol burn."

3.0,"First time having a no corn rye... definitely different for me. If you’re looking for sweetness, you won’t find it with this. Tried it neat and then added a couple drops of water, it’s a reminiscent of a single malt but with more spice. I might like it more by the time I get to the end of the bottle."

3.0,"Only serious rye fans need apply here. High rye ryes aged less than a year have a very distinctive flavor and this one has it in abundance. Think of a young Lot 40. Even at 90 proof, there’s still a ton of flavor going on. 

For my NC friends, Dad’s Hat isn’t available in our ABC system so go out and get a bottle of Doc Porter Rye. It’s made in a similar way and has a very similar flavor."

3.0,"You've been making your way across the visitor center compound, and see a velociraptor walking along with the bartender's arm in its mouth. Somehow this bottle is still clenched by the bartender's hand.

Plenty of rye spice on the nose, but also some orange. Rye bread, leather, some oak, and a noticeable earthy taste. It's very heat forward that fades almost completely by mid palate.

It's not bad, but save yourself the stress of having to play tug of war with that velociraptor. It's not worth trying to save that bottle."
4.5,Amazing rye
2.25,Very spicy.....
3.5,"Lovely golden brown amber color. Fruity and flowery nose. Initial taste is tobacco and leather. Then the rye spiciness takes over. Absolutely reminds me of Balcones malt whiskeys, except it has a bit of a clay finish"
