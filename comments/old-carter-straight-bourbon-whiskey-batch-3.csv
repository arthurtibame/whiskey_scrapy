4.0,"Batch 3: 2019

Purportedly a blend of 12 to 15-year-old bourbon from Tennessee. 

Can’t find the mashbill but previous releases have had 8% barley and 8% rye with the rest being corn. 

Nose: dusty dark fruits, possibly a little cherry, oak, vanilla, hints of cinnamon and apple 

Palate: rich and oily with plenty of rye spice, hint of more dark fruits, more oak

Finish: medium to long, more rye spice 

Surprisingly spicy but as this is the first pour out of the bottle, I will revisit in a couple of weeks."
4.0,"Decent. Mild baking spice but not much rye. Pretty smooth. Subtle cherry. Not too oaky given the rumored 15yr age. Good bourbon, very good for Dickel which I’m usually a big fan of.  Not much that really stands out though. Was hoping for a little more for the price."
4.5,"Rumored to be 12-15 yr. old Dickel/MGP juice. Dark fruits, marzipan, baking spices on the nose. Dark cherries and delicious creaminess that fully coats the mouth. That perfect amount of heat/spice you want from being barrel proof."

4.0,"Coming back to this bottle after 10 days. Main difference from this tasting and the last is the rye spice is less up front. If this is a blend of 12-15 yr/old Dickel, which previous releases were rumored to be, it isn’t surprising because of their high corn and low rye mash bill. 

Proof: 106.8

Batch 3, Bottle 994 of 1539

Color: beautiful amber 

Nose: deep, dusty cherries, corn, butterscotch and caramel 

Palate: quite rich but lighter and not as oily as I remembered from the last tasting, more caramel and some vanilla, a nice amount of oak, baking spices start to show up mid palate

Finish: medium to long and spice shows up at the end

Overall this is a great blend, and I’m not sure how much 15-year-old
Bourbon is in this but it’s not overly oaky at all. Is it worth the $150 - $200 price point? I don’t think it is. A good Russell’s Reserve Barrel pick is just as good for 1/3 the cost. If you want something closer to this (probable) mash recipe then grab some Knob Creek Single Barrel — especially if
you have store picks in your area that are
more than 10 years old."
3.25,Tasty and spicy. Very strong flavor with no aftertaste
