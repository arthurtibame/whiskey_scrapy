4.5,"My God it's even better than batch 003!

The nose! I could just nose this one for days and not get bored. Even though it's marketed as a sherry bomb, it's terribly well balanced. Dark chocolate and dates and baking spices and currants and wave after wave of mouth watering smells. Every visit is a bit different but equally delightful.

The taste follows suit, with the addition of creamy, balanced malt with all the other flavors. This is obviously a high quality new make spirit. I went and watched the videos on the Tamdhu website about how they make their spirit and acquire their casks. It clearly isn't just marketing BS, but true integrity in the production process. Absolutely worth the extra $$$.

The finish is endless, warming, with reminders of Christmas cookies, particularly ginger snaps, and these little almond sugar cookies I make with maraschino cherries, along with all the same notes from the nose. 

This is an insanely well integrated malt, and well worth all the effort I took to track it down. My fear was with this being batch 004 that the quality would have slipped, like with the Aberlour that everyone here complains about now, but it mercifully hasn't. The producers at Tamdhu have clearly put high value on quality over quantity, and even at $90, I feel like I got a great deal on a quality malt. Batch 002 was a bit harsh for my palate, and batch 003 was one of the best things I'd ever tasted until now, and batch 004 is even better. The peak of sherry cask aging. Cheers!"

4.5,"Lovely warm nose, with scents of heather, honey, floral.  At ‘Batch’ strength (57.6%) it does benefit from a few drops of water, but it opens to a warm, wonderful and pleasantly spicy.  Highly recommended."

3.75,Prune and vanilla on the nose. Great velvety mouth feel. Aged stone fruit and sweet vanilla with a pleasant oiliness on the tongue. Genuinely enjoyable Speyside dram.
3.5,"Nose is sweet and spicy, with notes of cinnamon and apple pie. Medium body, with a long finish and a bit of alcohol burn. Added quite a bit of ice water to this one...57.8% is nuts! 2019 advent calendar, day 14"
3.75,"Nose: walnuts, maple, brown sugar, alcohol, pine-sol, floral 

Palate: oak, slight brine, nice warmth, brown sugar, cocoa bitterness, baking spice

Finish: oak, nice warmth, slight brown sugar, cocoa bitterness"
3.0,2019 advent smells of oak and maple tastes of spice hint of dark chocolate
3.5,Boozy and smooth
4.0,"Spash of water, neat. Very good. Smooth with some heat. Oak and walnut nose, sweetness. Oak, Christmas spices, biscuits. Fruit on finish... berries. Has an almost higher quality Walker (I hate you, JW) peat puff but very mellow. Flavors of Gen Scotia 15. Not a Sherry bomb; simply adds some profile."
4.0,"Cherry, sherry, hard candy, iodine, oil, sweet and sharp, this is a superior and unique spirit. 
The sherry cask element is strong but not overwhelming, and the heat -- which is a pure, red pepper-type heat, with zero unpleasant afterburn -- keeps the sweetness in perspective.
A very unusual yet very alluring taste, it has the clarity of an Irish whiskey but the depth and color of an Islay, and all without the overwhelming presence of either peat or sweet (with just an implication of the former and just a reminder of the latter). This is first rate, and will go on my top shelf."

4.0,"Nose(neat): A commanding and warmly aromatic combination of oak, oloroso sherry, blackstrap molasses and dark chocolate with big spice notes of exotic origin rumbling in the background - curry spices, freshly ground cardamom, coriander, cumin and cinnamon. There is a spirity tightness and strong prickle from the alcohol volume, which is to be expected, and it makes the nose difficult to penetrate at first. Over time it opens to reveal a little vanilla and some citrus hints.
Nose (watered): Much softer with the addition of just a dash of water. Orange juice, red berries, dried apricots and a hint of anise appear. Over time the oak notes re-assert.
[The dry-glass aroma is maple syrup toffee].

Palate (neat): Whip-crackingly spicy with effervescent white pepper and sharp dark fruit notes. As the alcohol subsides it develops into a rounder and even more fruit-driven dram featuring a whole packet of mixed dried fruits soaked in oloroso sherry. The palate expands in the direction of bitter marmalade sprinkled with coffee crystals and the texture is well-poised, never venturing anywhere near cloying sweetness.
Palate (watered): Delicious semi-sweet sherried fruits, roasted nuts and marzipan. Tropical fruits, gingerbread and warm soft spices. The texture gains creaminess but there is always the reassuring grip of really good oak casks holding everything together. Over time as it evolves it gains more sweetness. Masterfully constructed.

Finish (neat): Medium/long. Warming and juicy with milder spice and sherry notes. There is a slightly flinty hardness in the aftertaste and a dark cacao flavour which eventually gives way to juicy dark fruit.
Finish (watered): The only substantial differences are the disappearance of the flinty note and appearance of juicy fruit flavours, with an accompanying sweeter aftertaste.

This is the first Tamdhu I've tasted that I've really enjoyed, and I enjoyed it a lot. The previous expressions I've tasted have seemed lazy, shy, unbalanced and lacking in presence, but there is none of that here. This is a big, hulking, dry sherry-monster - but an elegant one as well. He is easily tamed with a dash of water and then shows his more sensitive and subtle side.

It has a very interesting and engaging progression and responds to dilution very well. It is also sparkling clean and the cask selection was impeccable - if you told me this was a single cask out-turn I'd believe you.

The nose is formidable and even when tasted neat the palate is not hot, although certainly intense. However I did prefer it with the addition of just half a teaspoon of water. This lost nothing of the assertive character but allowed a host of very agreeable sweeter and more delicate tones to also emerge. This is a delightful whisky that repays lengthy and thoughtful tasting.

Tasted from a purchased 30ml sample. At the asking price it is excellent value and I've just ordered a full-size bottle.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"
4.0,"Nose is maple and some smoke. Sweet candied bacon

Palate is rich and creamy with bitter dark chocolate and raisans.

Finish has an alcohol burn but lingers with rich dark fruits and sherry

Top notch dram

Not for the feint hearted !"
4.5,"Appearance: copper with high viscosity

Nose: light campfire smoke with maple, pluot, and sherry

Palate: sweet, salty, and creamy. Medium to high proof, with medium to high body. Beautiful sherry finish

One of my favorites. Looking forward to trying the other batches."
4.0,"Chocolate, sea salt, cool spring algae on wet stone in a deep part of the forest that sees only sprays of sun...and even a tiny suggestion of cigars and chicken broth (yes, chicken broth). Very, very smooth for such a high proof, with just a little hot oil on the sides of the mouth. Not decadent -- like one of Ardbeg's peaty delights -- but sensual, complex, even strange, a whole conversation in a heavily carpeted library, with many old and new friends whispering, excitedly. A rare single malt, not to be taken for granted, not to be casually drank -- imagine Macallan 18's more interesting younger brother."
4.5,"A wonderfully complex nose makes clear its time spent in sherry. Very balanced on the palate, work a long, lingering finish. I'm reminded of baked treats, fine chocolate, a bit of fruit. Definitely worthy of a second tasting!"
4.25,"Nose: spice, sweet, floral, salt
Oak, fruit, spice, slight smoke"
