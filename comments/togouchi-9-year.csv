3.75,"Very subtle peatiness, an very little smoke on this if any. Floral notes come forward on the 2nd nosing. Citrus an white raisins on the second taste. Finish is complex and carries the citrus through with a bit of peat again at the end. I found this to be very pleasant. Got this through a tasting pack from Flavair. I don’t think I would spend more than $50-$60 a bottle on this, but it would definitely be worth it at that price point."

3.75,"Nose is smoky with a bit of peat, caramel slowly creeps out on second nosing. Taste is mostly caramel with bits of cinnamon and citrus and dark dried fruits."
3.0,"Almost get some Ardbeg flavor, but smoother. I hear this is scotch and Canadian whiskey aged in Japan. I wouldnt go back to it. Got this sample in Flavair kit."

2.25,"I am going to be as honest as possible here: DO NOT BUY THIS. 

This is not even Japanese Whisky, is scottish matured in japan. Even the NAS expression is better. 

Pale Straw color, 40%abv.

On the nose, it is nothing. Rice and soap. But very dim.

On the palate is spicy with maybe a wasabi/chilli note. 

Aftertaste is short with a small peat note and pepper. Overall i give this dram a very low score: 48/100. Not recommended."
