4.5,"Wow...this one surprised me.  SMWS was at one point a real good independent bottler, but of late has become mediocre.  This is not one of those.  This is a single cask 10 yr cask strength Caol Ila.  Matured in simply refill ex-bourbon...nothing fancy.  

How do you know when a whisky is a good whisky?  I think it’s pretty simple: 1) reasonable price, which makes you want to open and share, rather than keep stashed away; 2) great distillate and cask quality; 3) no marketing, flying under the radar, and let the liquid speak for itself ; and 4) fly off the shelves despite lack of marketing and hype.  Kilkerran 8 was one of those, at least in my recent memory.  This is another.  I paid barely $60.  In minutes it was sold out.  

I had to dilute with some water, which is generally the case for me and CS whiskys.  But the aroma...wow.  Lemons grilling over a flame.  Taste is grilled lobster, eating it in an old style diesel operated fishing boat.  It’s simple and straightforward, just well crafted Islay.  

At USD $60..BUY on sight.  Skip the hype and price gauging from others, and go for this instead."
