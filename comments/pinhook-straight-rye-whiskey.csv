3.75,"A little burn, but otherwise very nice. Has some good herbal characteristics and the price is right."
3.5,This drinks real easy. It tastes like summer. Very sweet lemongrass and honey. Smells like it tastes. Sign of good things to come from this distillery.
4.0,"Nose: Key-lime pie with whipped cream.  Lemongrass.  The citrus coming off this nose is crazy - almost like citrus oils were added directly to the whiskey.  Red bell pepper, thyme, basil.  Pine-Sol.  Fresh cut grass, barnyard hay.  Underripe bananas.  Tart cherries, floral.  There's an almost tequila-like experience to this nose.  Some oak, though not much.

Palate:  Honey, key lime, whipped cream with vanilla.  Oak, though not much - almost more of a sandalwood.  Loads of fruit character - there's now ripe blueberry, strawberry, apricot, blackberries...  Even ripe banana.  The vegetal notes are now more of a mint and clove oil than on the nose.  Mouthfeel is medium light.  Finish begins with the mint, fruit, and citrus oil rushing to the fore.  The fruit and mint just start to fade off while some tannin shows up.  The pine, citrus oil, and mint then trade blows and this fades off.  Medium-long finish.

Other notes: This stuff is weird in the absolute best way.  It's got all sorts of character without being ""challenging"" - there's not much to acclimate to which makes it easy to dive in head-first and go for it.  The citrus and fruit here are totally out of left field for me, and showcase that rye is a much more capable category than I think most are aware.  This won't be everybody's jam, but to me it's a beautiful idea and execution."

3.75,"Earthy with a slight floral kick, very smooth, with a minimal spicy note. More like a scotch than whiskey profile"
4.0,"Sweet, smooth, some fire, perfect."
4.0,"Spicy, caramel, pepper"
4.5,"-Neat to start and ended with one ice cube.
-Nose: forest pine, wildflowers, bit of rosewater.
-Palate: Citrus (orange) initially, then spearmint and clove fight back and forth.
-Finish: Clove spice lingers citrus pleasantly stays on the tongue.
-No need for ice, however, it does bring out deeper herbal and orange peel notes."
