3.5,"Dessert-y, fruity but a tad rough - still enjoable

4.0,"En rik og chewy whisky med veldig fyldig munn og lett sødme. Toffee, bakt eple og tørket frukt over lett bitter sjokolade. God lengde, men mangler kanskje litt letthet og struktur."
3.5,Sea is more noticable on the nose. Much more brine on the palate than the 15. Nice dried fruit finish.
3.5,very soft and very smooth and a little caramel and sherry
4.25,"I had a chance to try the new Old Pulteney range again last night, in a slightly more controlled setting than the whisky show where I tried some of them last year, and I can say that the 15 is the standout. The secondary maturation in ex-Oloroso sherry casks lends it some lovely dry nutty flavors that are well balanced with the classic Pulteney briny notes. While it doesn’t rise to the heights of the discontinued 21, it’s a more than respectable addition to the range."

4.75,"This has a delightful nose - it's woody and spicy, with maritime notes.  The barley malt is definitely present, but it's wrapped in oak.  There is a little bit of mustiness with a hint of peanuts/peanut shells.  Perhaps just a touch of vanilla.

I can taste the classic Pulteney flavor, it's salty - the whisp of smoke is not really here in the older whiskey, but the extra wood in the finish makes up for it - this is a spicy whiskey- the spice is somewhere between cinnamon and black pepper- kind of a mix between the two but with the sharper edges filed off.  It's really pleasant, it leaves a long, spicy, woody but herbal finish.

The mouth feel is oily, but it's almost like it's got a few layers - a thinner, malty side that fades into an oilier, woodier, more coastal side."

4.5,"Federal Wines and Spirits, located on Beacon Hill in Boston, is known for an exceptional whiskey selection.  Last week I was in downtown Boston with just enough time to make a quick first visit before a business dinner.

Beacon Hill is a beautiful area and FWS is located in an attractive stone building.  But I entered a scene reminiscent of a downtrodden bodega - small and cramped, zero decor, and bottles randomly strewn across shelves.  But as my eyes focused, gems were revealed.  On the messy shelves sat a HIghland Park Fire next to a Yamazaki 18.  There were vintage bottles of Ardbeg, a Mortlach 25, Springbanks up to 21 years, a Macallan Rare Cask, and numerous high-end drams from bottlers I've never heard of.  I was quickly greeted by an older gentleman behind the counter.

Him: ""Looking for anything in particular?""
Me (at a loss for words): ""No.""
Him: ""Well, what do you like?""
Me (at a loss for cogent thoughts): ""I like a lot of things...and wow, you have a lot of amazing whiskeys.""
Him: ""We have a lot more that aren't out on the shelves, so it would help if you and I had a dialogue"".

Fortunately, I recovered my ability to make meaningful conversation, and our discussion commenced.   Somewhere along the way, I noted I recently tried and very much enjoyed Old Pulteney 17.  He smiled. ""We just got the new line"", he said, revealing a bottle of the new 15 from behind the counter that was about a third full.  Pointing to the low level of remaining juice, he told me the bottle had just been opened two days prior.  ""It's VERY good,"" he said as he reached for a plastic cup and gave me a pour.

VERY good indeed.  

I purchased a bottle and headed to dinner.  I opened it the next night for a more relaxed and deliberate sampling.

On the nose, there is sea air, brown sugar, and sherried fruit notes.  The palate has the same notes as the nose, plus some toffee, raisins, and a hint of dark chocolate on the finish.   It's certainly different than the Old Pulteney 12 or the 17, but retains many of the key characteristics of both, with the saltiness being the most notable.  

Compared to the 17, I like the 15 just a bit better.  It has stronger sherry barrel notes, and I enjoy those notes very much.  Those who prefer a bit more oak influence will likely favor the 17.

Overall, this is a fantastic new dram, a keeper for sure.  And a great start to my dialog with the good folks at FWS, to which I will certainly return."

4.0,"The nose is Highland or Speyside bourbon-cask scotch, with a coastal, salty character.  The palate is pretty much the same, with a full mouthfeel.  Barrel spice and salt in the finish.  If this were peated (sigh, wish), this could be a contender to an HP15 (though, I've never tasted the latter).  It's that good.  Thanks for the experience @jonwilkinson7309 , you're a gentleman with taste.  50ml sample.

2.0,"The aroma is okay, but the flavor is strange, especially in the finish. I wish I could describe it better, but I can’t. I’m simply not a big fan of this. 3 cl sample from the 12 Drams of Christmas Premium (2019 Edition)."
3.75,Dramfest 2020. Had low expectations but not to bad at all. Wouldn't run out and grab a bottle though

3.5,"Old Pulteney tasting event, Sydney, February 26, 2020, Whisky #3

Nose: A very maritime nose – brine, minerality, flinty rocks, yeasty bread. Toffee and cocoa, light fruitcake and mild spice. Some spirity notes.

Palate: Full spicy/sweet entry with a foundation of dry brine and tannin. Sourdough bread, dark-chocolate dipped candied orange peel, green apple peel and salt-water taffy as it unfolds. Water greatly improved the palate for me, adding considerable balancing sweetness and an impressive density to the texture, but still retaining the fundamentally dry character.

Finish: Medium. Very dry, briny and earthy finish with a touch of orange marmalade.

The nose is reminiscent of the 12 year old expression but with greater heft – richer, rounder, sweeter, etc. – but it has formidable dry quality. Very much the 12 year old's big brother. For a 15 year old this is very spirit driven and on the palate the dryness really becomes apparent with the brine notes turning astringent and acerbic in the finish.

This is being marketed (and priced) as more-or-less the replacement for the old 17 year expression, but in my view it’s nothing at all like it, and nowhere near as good (the 18 year is much more the replacement, but it also falls short). Still, it should be judged on its own merits and not in comparison.

This has received restrained sherry treatment, spending 13 1/2 years in ex-bourbon and then 1 1/2 years in ex-sherry (both first fill). The brand rep at the tasting let drop that they source the sherry casks from the same bodega as Glenfarclas, which means they are ex-oloroso from Bodegas José y Miguel Martin. The bourbon casks are a variety, but Buffalo Trace feature.

A good expression, but at the price not fantastic value. Some folks at the tasting event liked this a lot but while I enjoyed it, it left me just little cold and I’d not buy a bottle.

“Good” : 3.5 stars"
