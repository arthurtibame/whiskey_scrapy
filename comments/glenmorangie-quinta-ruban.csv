2.5,Just didn't do it for my palate. Way too much heavy sweetness and dried fruit. But would probably be good for those who like that.
4.25,Damn good dram. Great mouth feel. Complex flavor. Have to have it neat or the flavor gets weakened by the ice.

4.0,"Like the 10yr and Lasanta, was looking forward to this. Poured neat, ruby color with nose of berries. Black & raz both coming through with good malt presence. Has a strawberry cheesecake note that reminds me of Chivas Extra. Creamy mouthfeel leads into palate of dark fruit, malt richness and roasted coffee surrounded by barrel oak. Very nice depth. Finish is drying oak, malt, trailing fruits with more light roast coffee. Overall an excellent scotch. Strong maltiness and deep fruits only the dry finish holds it back from upper level elite score. I like it more than Dalmore12 and would need to revisit Lasanta to call that one ..........90/100.....$44 at Total Wine, will keep this one around for a delicious port cask finished single malt"

4.0,"Chocolate covered raisins, mint chocolates, and chocolate candied orange peel. Certainly on the sweet side of the scotch spectrum, but the port maturation adds a nice complexity to it. Very thick mouthfeel. Warm and smooth, long finish. Perfect late night dram."

3.75,"Long aftertaste. Sweetness. Banana on the nose, and taste - the green dry one that sticks to your tongue. Good! No smoke. Some pepper. Even some metallic hint on the way end of the aftertaste. Caramell/sugar sweetness. Round and oily taste."
4.5,"Sweet, strawberry notes, excellent finish. Prettiest color in a scotch I’ve ever seen - Dark, rich amber with a hint of pink.🏆"
3.75,"Sweet, easy to taste the port influence"
4.25,"This was wonderfully sweet, succulent and rich. Very nice and delicious. The nose smelled like a decadent port red wine. Highly recommend"

3.5,"First opened
No water

Nose - dark fruit, very port”y”, musty grain

Taste - fruity with a dry finish, raisins, fairly straightforward and simple

Overall - almost a heavy port it is so fruity, very tasty, would buy again"
3.5,Good but not as good as I had expected.

4.0,"I think this is my new favorite Highland. Rich and full, sweet and fruity. Fantastic finish."
2.5,"Very intensive, lack of master taste"
5.0,One of my favorite all time Scotchs. Have not tried the 14yo. Sweet with some complexity on both the nose and palate.
