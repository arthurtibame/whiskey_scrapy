2.0,"This was a curiosity purchase. Not much on the pallet other than rye pepper which takes a second to kick in. There is a faint hint of barley. The rye pepper stays on the finish but fades pretty quick. The rye pepper builds as you sip. 

Tried with cola and with Mt. Dew. It was quite good with the Mt. Dew."
