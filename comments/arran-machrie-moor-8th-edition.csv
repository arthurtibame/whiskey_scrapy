4.5,"Nose: at first musty, tobacco, cigarette, but followed by banana and tropical fruit on the back. As tasting goes on, more and more banana becomes apparent on the front.
Taste: light vanilla, banana and floral mixed with a peaty tobacco smoke. Smooth and buttery. Incredibly well balanced.
Finish: medium-long, light peat, ashy

End of bottle at time of rating but consistently one of my favorites. Great summer dram."
