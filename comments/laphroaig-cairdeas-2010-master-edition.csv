3.75,"Similar to the Laga 11 this isn't really a style for me I believe. More astringent lighter peated flavor. It is to the Laphroaig CS 10 what the Laga 11 is to the Laga 16. The former drams more tighter, astringent, slightly acidic peat versus the richer profiles of the latter which I preferred. Thanks for the chance to try Lee!"
