3.0,Not a huge fan of sour mashes. Notes of tar and baking spices are immediate. Long lasting mild sawdust flavor.

5.0,"Oaky, sweet, vanilla.  Very complex. Had this on a cruise, and my bartender gave it to us as part of a pappy van winkle flight.  Unfortunately, I didn't make detailed tasting notes, so I'm doing this based off of memory. Get this if you can!"
