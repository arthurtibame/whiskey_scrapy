4.25,"Said to be a somewhat watered down (42.2%) Lagavulin. Somewhat lightly peated for an Islay, works for someone like me who prefers Highland with just a touch of peat and hints of honey and has never liked Lagavulin. Great value at Total Wine."
2.5,No wow factor at all. However after finishing the bottle it is good for the price (< $30) Has some peat but not on par with a laguvalin or talisker.  Writing this on memory...
3.5,Light peat and smoke.  Floral but not fruity.  Not oily and does not linger.  The combination creates a light and refreshing flavor profile.  A good scotch to enjoy on a hot summer day.
2.5,"Just OK. The biggest drawback is, it has that odd sort of ‘tequila’ taste to it associated with adding smoke after the fact.  Probably won’t buy this again."

4.0,Smoke on the nose but a sweet finish. Add a few drops of water to open it up.  Fantastic value!
3.75,"Milder than expected, well balanced, citrus notes."
