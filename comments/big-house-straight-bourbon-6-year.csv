3.0,"Excellent for a cheaper bourbon! Picked it up October 2016 for less than $30, incredibly smooth and rich for a rye this cheap, with a long, spicy finish. Definitely a ""sip and sit a minute"" bourbon."

4.0,"Nose of vanilla and oak.
Pallet of rye spice, vinilla, oak and slight pepper. Splash of water opens up vanilla and Carmel, but suppresses the pepper fi ish. On the rocks mites moste flavors but Carmel, but really opens up the pepper. I prefer this neat as on the rocks or with a splash mites the burn in the chest that I prefer.
The finish is very long neat, but subdued other ways."

4.0,"All I can really say is, WOW. What a sleeper. Just because this doesn’t have a well know name, don’t pass it up. Give this sleeper a try. This Is a well rounded Bourbon for the money. At $19.99 I find this Bourbon really really good...."
2.75,Moderate heat. Tastes a little like black licorice

4.0,"""Rather than taking time to express tasting notes immediately, let me just say that this bourbon is a real sleeper; and has been since it first hit the shelves several years ago. Since I’m a big Buffalo Trace fan, I would hasten to say that this falls just slightly below BT. On the pallet, bit less sweet and complex, Big House hits you immediately with a full and dense mouthfeel of oak, leather, tobacco, spice and just the right balance of vanilla and smoke. The nose literally takes me to open fields of grass, and then into the woods, where a pastoral panorama makes you long for a countryside resplendent in wildflowers. (Sometimes I do the pallet before the nose.) A nice long finish makes one long for more. Giving new meaning to “bang for the buck”!! This is always in my stash, regardless of my love affair with high proofed bourbons. (Can you say Booker’s, Bakers, Knob Creek SB etc.?! Ah knew ya could....)
Cheers!!!!"""
