3.0,"Blind tasting - 1.5 oz neat in a Glencairn - both bottles less than half full
Maker's Mark Cask Strength Batch 19-02 (54.8%, open since March) vs. 
Larceny Barrel Proof A120 (61.6%, open since February)

Color:
Very similar medium amber, #B slightly darker

Nose:
A - Subtle baking spices, cinnamon and nutmeg. Some oak mixed with citrus peel, light caramel and sugar
6/10
B - Bready oak and ethanol, toffee, nutmeg, toasted vanilla bean
6/10

Palate:
A - Oak and cherry, brown sugar, cinnamon bun, ethanol burn minimal
7/10 
B - Cinnamon and nutmeg flavored shortbread, stewed or jam dark fruits, burnt caramel, palate quickly overpowered by ethanol burn
4.5/10

Finish:
A - Tannic oak that lingers, medium oily finish, ethanol builds quickly
5/10
B - Strongly tannic and drying, long finish that burns, one-note flavor
3/10

Drinkability:
A - 6.5/10
B - 4.5/10

Total score:
A = 24.5/40
B = 18/40

A = Maker's Mark Cask Strength 19-02
B = Larceny Barrel Proof A120

I was surprised that I didn't really favor one nose over the other, despite there being clear differences. What sets them apart is the palate and finish. The Larceny BP runs hot, the ethanol and oak hit the tongue quickly overpowering other flavors and  dominates the finish. It is slightly unpleasant, especially compared to the MMCS. For me the Larceny is less complex and harsher to drink."
3.75,"Carmel, leather, and a berry hint on the nose. Taste: cinnamon, oak and grains hit on the taste until it hits the back of your throat when the heat comes in. Nice up front punch and warms the whole way down but the burn doesn't continue. Very good sub $50 Barrel proof."

Tastes strong spices on the tongue there were some tastes of alcohol right off (sounds silly I know, but is smooth for the higher proof) the bat but warm on the way down and finishes with vanilla notes"

4.25,"Nose- Brown Sugar, and some hints of buttered bread

Palate- very sweet when it touches your palate and sweet throughout

Finish- smooth and spicy"
3.75,"Nose: Cola-like carmel dominates, hints of vanilla and grain with a slight touch of medicinal cherry note. 
Palate: similar to the nose but dominated by the spice rush that comes on quick and strong. 
Finish: Harsh spice that hits pretty quickly and lingers towards the front of the palate then fades. 

Overall it’s an interesting pour but does leave some things to be desired. Would like to see what it’d be if aged another 4 years. 86/100"

4.25,"At $49 this is great.   Weird but reminds a bit of Blanton’s barrel proof which makes sense given the age/ proof  being similar.  Great pour this is pretty smooth but lacks the finish and little complexity that give higher marks.  But still damn good at price point if you can find it there,  buy all day.  If not would recommend just buying a couple bottles of ECBP."

3.75,"I've been anticipating this in NC ever since it was announced, and finally got my hands on a bottle today after bugging my local ABC store weekly. After two glasses tonight my first reaction is minor disappointment. I love Heaven Hill but am not a huge fan of Larceny. Still, I love high proof whiskey and I thought the barrel proof would be an improvement over the regular release. At the moment this is my least favorite high proof bourbon I've had in the last year. It is easily the strongest ethanol nose and taste of them all, which is not dissimilar from their 92 proof. The spices come out, but not a pleasant dessert spice. Whatever fruits in here are muted, except the apples others get. This is much drier and harsher than the ECBP A119 that I have open.

Obviously this is a first reaction and I'm going to let this bottle sit for a few weeks/months before I give an updated review. I prefer Maker's Mark and its Cask Strength to both Larceny products. But it's still awesome to have a big brand release a new cask strength, especially when wheated are less common.

Batch A120, 123.2 proof"
3.75,"This one is fun. A relatively poor expert score, but solid user reviews. Nose is sweet with, but a tad ethanol heavy. First sip is a flood of caramel and brown sugar. A strong cinnamon burn rises quickly and slowly recedes. Truth be told I don't love larceny, but this is a very nice poor."
3.75,Brown sugar and vanilla on the nose. Sweet palate with a spicy finish. Smooth for the 123.2 proof.
3.75,"Molasses, oak and pears on the nose. Sweet molasses and leathery taste, can definitely taste the heat from the high proof. Finish doesn't linger too long, little bit of that pear stays with me at the end."
4.25,null
4.0,"Nose: classic Heaven Hill peanut, vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, chocolate, like sniffing a melted Snickers in a glass

Palate: follows the nose with a slight peanut note and all of the sweet notes mentioned before, this drinks like a dessert and that is definitely a good thing. Milk chocolate, vanilla, brown sugar, good mouth feel.

Finish: medium, with some barrel bitter, then the nuts and chocolate come back

If you like a Snickers bar this is your whiskey. It isn’t overly complex like the other barrel proof offerings such as Elijah Craig and Stagg Jr that it will inevitably be compared to. It does fit nicely between Makers Mark Cask Strength and Elijah Craig as far as the flavor profile and it is worth having in your collection. If you can find this around $60 buy it, but don’t over pay for it. There will be two more batches this year so if you miss this one wait on #2 or #3. 


Also, if you do get a bottle, let it open up. Some air and time definitely does it favors."

3.0,"I've always been a fan of the standard issue Larceny... For around $18 it's an inoffensive easy sipper... So when Heaven Hill announced this release ofcourse I was curious! Let's dive into the specifics:

Age: 6-8 yrs batch
Mashbill: 68% Corn, 20% Wheat, 12% Malted Barley
ABV: 61.5% (Yes Distiller was wrong again... Shocking I know)
SRP: $50 (limited availability)

Upon entry it's a pretty viscous mouthfeel... Thick caramel, vanilla and brown sugar greet you .... Oak then becomes apparent with a hint of chocolate... The finish is short with a heavy dose of oak and oak spice!

Overall, it's a simple and enjoyable pour.... Nothing more! At SRP or close to it it's a solid pick up otherwise pass..."
4.0,Nose is brown sugar and Carmel taste is plenty more of the same. It’s spicy as well a little cinnamon and not overwhelming comes in hot and finishes with a good ky hug the finish is sweet as well. Larceny is one of my favorite regular drinkers this makes everything about regular larceny better.

4.0,"-On the nose: Peanuts, dry salted caramel, vanilla, light chocolate and black pepper. The pepper is easy to get mixed up in the proof because it’s quite different from the other notes. 
The scent profile is pretty exciting. It’s like smelling a payday candy bar with a little spicy chocolate. 
-Palette and Finish: black pepper up front with a hint of the salted caramel. The salted caramel gets stronger and is joined with peanuts. The finish is long and very enjoyable as a sweeter chocolate and vanilla come back to you in the end. 

The proof is hot, but it shouldn’t be more than you’re expecting. It’s worth letting this breath and working past the proof for this flavor. I really enjoyed this and was glad to have found a bottle of batch A120."

4.0,"The nose has caramel corn, light soft leather, cooked plumbs, baking spices with freshly baked bread.

The palate is thick, sweet and coating, and slightly drying, but on the 2nd sip it is no longer drying. I get sweet corn, peanuts, baking spices, oak and caramel.

The finish is long and leaves the tip of the tongue tingling. It has lingering vanilla and dusty corn.

I really enjoyed this. Defiantly fits the heaven hill profile. I wouldn’t have been able to guess that this was a wheated bourbon if I tried it blind, but it’s still great."

3.5,"Neat.  Nose is sweet but also spicy for a wheater.  Black pepper and cinnamon jump out at me first.  Nice charred caramel.  Dusty corn with a bit of funk.  I like this nose.

Nice viscous and oil to it.  Yep that is Larceny.  Full disclosure, not a fan of base Larceny.  I like this better but those notes I don’t like are here.  Even just hitting the tongue, it’s a damn Red Hot.  Sugar and hot cinnamon.  Some nice caramel and oak is there after I fight my way through the Red Hot cinnamon.  Finish is medium but still cinnamon.

This brand in general just doesn’t fit my palate and profile I guess.  I don’t foresee hunting Larceny releases the same way I do ECBP.  Just not for me."

3.25,"Nose- vanilla, ethanol, brown sugar, 

Mouth - proof is immediately present, aggressive heat that you have to fight to get past. 

Finish - pecan pie crust and all, dusty dryness that I get from regular Larceny, but not as noticeable

If you like Larceny, it’s definitely a step up. I’m not the biggest fan but this is definitely better than the original."

Nose - spice and the rich sweetness of molasses and corn

Palate - SPICY with hint of molasses and slight fruit. Real explosion of richness, flavor and depth 

Finish - long and strong with solid spice and dry feel  

It is most definitely a barrel proof.  Upon your first swallow you will feel the full wrath of this selection."

3.0,"Bold, strong, spicy"
4.25,"Nose is sweet, showing brown sugar, vanilla buttercream, marshmallow, caramel, new leather, cinnamon, and maraschino cherries.

Smokier and darker on the palate. Slow burn too with that nice high proof tingle. Still sweet but the brown sugar and caramel on the nose are darker, the fruit has turned to dark plum and some cassis, and the spice has become more pronounced, giving this better depth and balance. Rich, but not super smooth. 

Finish is on the leathery side showing some oak and spice. Good depth and length. 

Nice wheater. Not too sweet as the proof adds a bite and some spice."

3.25,"Nose: cloves/cinnamon, weirdly smells like a rye in the licorice direction even though I know it’s a wheater, black tea
Taste: oily and dense, nutty, where did all the baking spices go?
Finish: bitter oak, finishes dry despite the oily palate
After reading reviews: I can see where Flaviar is coming from with the wheat bread on the nose and molasses on the palate - that’s the dense dark flavor I was getting, but I don’t get any of the apple or fruitcake.  Whizzky reviews point out the nuttiness/hazelnut on the taste, but other people seem to get more sweetness from this than I do.  Overall, I’m underwhelmed.  I’m not a fan of the regular Larceny but had seen several reviews from people who share that opinion that indicated the barrel proof version was far superior.  Thankfully, the banana nut bread note that I dislike about the standard offering doesn’t come through here - but neither does much else on the palate.  The nose is very nice, but I wish more of that came through on the taste.  I don’t usually bother to add water, but maybe that will change things on the next try.  I hope so..."

4.0,"One of the intriguing wheaters I've had recently with RC6 & WSR. The nose presented to me with wheat dust I get on all wheaters follow with vanilla, baking spice, malted chocolate and oak char bordering on BBQ. The palate experience oak with a cinnamon pop, a softened coffee bitter, red fruit and an ethanol note that gave way to black pepper. The finish is medium and creamy with notes of cappuccino, bitter chocolate nibs, and a tarty tannic oak. Much better than the standard Larceny and complex enough to justify a repurchase at or near retail."

4.25,"Delicious. Eye: Dark Earl Grey Tea; Nose: Vanilla, Candy Corn, Dusty Corn, Citrus; Palate: Sweet sugar and cinnamon toast, with vanilla drizzle, With an instant Kentucky hug. It does not hide the proof. It just makes you think the sweet makes the heat. Finish medium to long with vanilla, sweet oak, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Definitely a wheated bourbon worth having."

4.25,"I can't help but to be strongly reminded of Elijah Craig Barrel Proof when I tried this, it is very similar in profile and 20$ cheaper! Without a drop or two of water it does pack a bit much heat for me, but the slightest bit of water tames it down into an extremely rich, pleasantly full bodied and sweet flavor. While it may not be extremely oily, it is also far from being thin! A must have if you enjoy Elijah and Stagg Jr!"
3.75,"Nice barrel proof wheater. Nose is fairly light considering the proof. Initial hit of alcohol is followed by sweet bready notes, fruit and caramel. Mouthfeel is fairly oily/thick with more sweet wheat and a long finish. Not bad at all, but i think wheaters are overhyped and would take its counterpart, ecbp over this any day."

4.0,"Nose: Cocoa and Coffee; Creamy lightly Spiced Horchata Cappuccino. Vanilla Honey and Peanut.

Palate: More Turtle than Snickers with Salted Caramel Peanuts coated in Milk Chocolate.

Finish: Peanut and Baking Spice hover above Plumb Pudding and Fig Fruit Notes. Black Peppered Peanut Shells and Dusty Corn Flakes lingers.

The A120 is a phenomenal BP loaded with complexity and nuisance, yet holds to the patent H.H. nuttiness notes. Good chew and little hug. I'm hoping to add a reserve bottle to my bar. This blows the 92 Proof away."

4.0,"Nose is very similar to Old Ezra 7. Peanut butter, cereal, oatmeal, bananas. Cinnamon. 

Palate is complex, round and rich. Long finish. Great bourbon. 

I use the rating scale below. Distiller uses a scale of 5 and I use a scale of 10, but I’m sure you’re not too drunk to do the math!

2. Poor - I wouldn't consume by choice.
3. Bad - Multiple flaws.
4. Below average - Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.
5. Good - Just average.

7. Great - Well above average.
