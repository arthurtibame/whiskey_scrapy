4.0,"'16 bottling: Strong oak character, joined by cinnamon and pepper notes, followed later by rich and decadent cupcake frosting. Mouthfeel is round and juicy upfront followed up by a dry finish. 4/5 stars but leaves A LOT to be desired from the $120+ price tag. Would feel much better about paying $50-80 for this one."

5.0,"The perfect profile - smooth start - rush of complex flavours - almost tart /spicy finish - if Michters only produced and sold the ten year old, they would be the best bourbon distiller / producer / brand in the world.  If you do manage to find a couple of bottles sitting on a shelf somewhere, buy both - drink one, then admire the other for the rest of your life ... Epic ."

3.0,"This is no doubt a great bourbon - complex flavors, and a unique toasted woody nose/flavor.   However, the price point is disappointing for me.  There are so many other 10 year bourbons on the market, and I will say this is a cut above something like the Eagle Rare 10 year, but for me the price differential is way to much.  I paid $170 for my bottle, but have seen some since for around $125 locally.   Eagle Rare 10yr is typically around $30 (without a 1 in front of the 30).   This would easily be 4 stars if not for the price."

4.0,"Nose - Heavy sweet vanilla, lightly oaky dark caramel, hint of dark chocolate covered cherries.
Taste - Sweet spicy cinnamon vanilla starts, a bit thin, dark brown caramel, faint oaky herbal funk, wisp of dark ripe bing cherries, hint of sweet tobacco, strawberry hard candies, strawberry glazed donut.
Finish - Lingering sweet spicy vanilla caramels, white pepper spice, lightly drying oak, berry hard candy sweet.
Score - 86/100
Final Thoughts - So this is a tasty bourbon that hits all of the classic ""bourbon"" notes. It's very smooth and has no harsh or off-putting smells or flavors. It's tasty neat, but I think some of the flavors are a bit muted due to the filtration. On its own it's very good, but when you factor in the price, you'd expect something like this to be offered at cask strength."

2.0,"2016 bottling. A hint of smoke on the nose, along with apples and caramel, and after a few minutes, vanilla. Somewhat of a sour note as well, and it stings like a higher proof. On the palate, acidic wood on the front end, bitter chocolate on the backend. The middle seems missing. Not sure why, I was expecting smoother, sweeter notes, but this is fairly sharp. Nice warmth going down. Hoping this opens up with time. 4/5/17 
    I get more of a nutty taste than last time, better than last time. The bitter oak notes are strong. Hopefully more airtime will continue to improve it. 5/5/17  
Not too much has changed. Still sharp and acidic and woody, still feels like drinking a thin, bitter menthol concoction. I was promised an unmistakable flavor of roasted nuts. Where?! It does have a lingering finish. Not worth the hype nor the price, in my opinion. But I'd love to try the 2017 version. 7/19/17
2018 bottling. Good nose, lots of roasted caramel and orchard fruits. Vanilla, oak. On the palate, rich, creamier than expected, sweet, acidic sting at the end. Still getting some bitter notes, but more muted and pleasant, not as overwhelming as my 2016 bottle. Cacao and pecan nibs linger, as well as slight char. Maybe 3 stars this time around. 6/6/18"

3 days later this bourbon is changing. When I first opened it I would have said pass unless you can afford it and pay retail. It's gotten much smoother now so I can't wait to taste it again in another month. I'd say definitely buy if you can afford it and get it for retail but let it air out some."

4.0,"Surprisingly a smooth dram. Nose is pretty muted, with some slight fruit skin (apple, pear) notes present. The Distiller tasting notes mentions ""hints of green olive"", and while it makes me uncomfortable to compare this bourbon to olives, there's that very hint of a sensation on the nose. Flavor wise, it wasn't a punch in the mouth but rather a very smooth collection of vanilla-y butterscotch and smoked/roasted nuts. Has the mouthfeel of the Michter's American Whiskey, which is pretty thin as well. Upper 80s for me, but a very decent pour indeed. Won't rush to buy further releases but I am very glad I was able to enjoy '18's release. Much better for cheaper out there."

This guy is a bit overrated if you ask me. It’s not bad. In fact I really enjoy it. But for $140, I’d rather shell out an extra $10 for a wild turkey masters keep if I want something unique and dynamic.

Body: medium

Palate: nice light spice with a salted caramel apple. 

Finish: nice slow burn with more apple

Note: I thought this was light, a nice bourbon but nothing stands out except it’s lightness and ease of drinking. I would buy this."

3.5,"Had a pour of the 2018 M10 at Whiskey Cake.

Nose - Pretty standard bourbon nose of oak, vanilla, and a bit of ethanol. Maybe a hint of leather.

Palate - Caramel, vanilla, baking spices, toasted nuts/toffee. Moderate finish was on the dry side, and a little hotter than I would expect for the proof.

Overall it's was nice but nothing extraordinary - not worth chasing down IMHO and definitely not worth secondary prices. The taste profile reminds me a lot of Heaven Hill; this drank like a proofed down, slightly older version of Elijah Craig Barrel Proof."
3.75,A bit overpriced but a good bourbon. Would be higher if not for the price. Can easily get multiple bottles of other bourbons that a it’s equal.

2.25,"So...I really enjoy Michter's American Whiskey #1 and I really wanted to like this especially given the $130 I spent on the bottle.  Very disappointed.

Nose: Not much other than sugar and wood.  A little alcohol burn.

Flavor: Nothing challenging or interesting.  Vanilla and wood.  This doesn't taste at all like it smells.  Super dry and not sweet at all.  LOTS of wood.  Too much wood.  Also a ton of ethanol burn.  It's like somehow this bourbon picked up all the wood flavor without any of the sweet complexity or reduction in burn that I've come to expect from something of this age and pedigree.

Finish: Short and brutal burning my throat with more dry wood.  Like sandpaper on my tongue.

I should point out this is my second taste of this bottle as I gave it a couple weeks with the bottle opened before going back and giving it another shot.  I was really hoping I was mistaken on my first try.  I feel cheated here and will seriously reconsider purchasing any more Michter's products in the future.  VERY disappointed.  I would have given this a 2.75 if it wasn't for the huge MSRP.  This bottle has MSRP higher than Pappy 15 and equivalent to most of the BTAC items.  Truly a waste of money.  Maybe someone will trade me something that is open and interesting?  Here's hoping."

4.25,"Nose is unassuming. Sort of what I think a typical bourbon should smell like, with no major characteristics standing out to me. 

Taste: Extremely smooth! Not overly spicy or sweet, and I’m typically sensitive to both. Mid-palate hints of fruit and licorice. I wonder what it would be like at a higher proof (2019 bottle, proof at 94.4). For the price, there are much better options, I’m sure, BUT this one would be great to pull out and share with someone newer to bourbon. 

A little water opened it up a bit and brought out some spice that gave it a very nice complexity!

The price says “special occasion”, but the taste says “anytime”. I recommend adding a touch or water or an ice cube and really enjoy it."

4.0,"Reviewing the Fall 2019 release, barrel# 19H2420

Color is warm mahogany, lots of thin, streaky legs after a quick swirl. 

Nose leads with Toffee, vanilla, red apples, cherry, a spearmint/evergreen note and varnished oak

Palate starts with brown sugar, then spearmint and some indeterminate fruit. The mint note lingers as the baking spice comes in on the mid palate. Those flavors linger into the finish where they're joined by vanilla and oak. The finish is fairly nice especially given the relatively low proof. 

This is a big improvement over the 2018 bottle I tried at a restaurant last year. Still not worth secondary prices, but if you can find a bottle a retail it's worth considering."

Finish- Long, unique finish of a carbonated cherry-cola sofa

I usually don’t use the word smooth to describe whiskey, but damn... this is smooth. Extremely balanced and tasty. The nose is fantastic- I love the caramel corn and buttered toffee notes. The palate is a bit underwhelming and not in your face but is very tasty and balanced with a very unique finish."

4.5,"Neat. Neck pour.  Tons of dusty corn upfront on the nose.  Burned caramel and honey graham cracker transitions to vanilla and black berry.  It’s a very inviting nose.  Less oak than I was expecting.  I might guess this is 7 to 8 years blind versus 10+.

A bit watery on the tongue.  Brown sugar and berry dominate as it is super sweet and pretty bright on the tongue.  It’s delicious and balanced.  Vanilla frosting on sea salt caramel.  The oak is finally showing up on the legs as a chocolate and it’s very drying and tannic.  Surprisingly long legs mostly due to the saliva fighting against the drying sensation.

Going in, I have always been nervous about the low proof on this one.  The thin texture doesn’t mean lack of flavor or short finish though.  The flavors it has are just standard bourbon flavors, but it’s perfectly balanced and has flavors for days.  Might be the most flavorful lower proof bourbon I can think of.  I’d have to jump up to Wild Turkey 17 maybe but that is very rich and oily too.

Sitting with it for twenty minutes now, it is REALLY opening up.  I suggest letting this sit in the glass if you get a bottle.  The nose is now incredible with such a rich oak emerging.  I could nose this all night.  A high amount of cinnamon is now coming out the taste too.  This is a fun one to spend some time with!"

The finish is smooth and buttery, coating the inside of your mouth like a warm hug. This may be my favorite bourbon tasting of 2020. Well worth the price I paid, which was slightly above MSRP but nowhere close to secondary market prices. Cheers! 🥃"
