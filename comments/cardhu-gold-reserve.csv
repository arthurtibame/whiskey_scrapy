5.0,"Dark, chocolatly, dark fruits, cherry"
2.5,"When travelling to Italy, I promised my sister in law that I would bring the whisky, only to realise upon arrival that I had completely forgotten them. Since she usually doesn’t like peaty whisky, I decided to sneakily purchase a non smokey dram from my ‘to try’ list, that wasn’t all too expensive. The Cardhu fitted the bill well. The Cardhu Gold Reserve isn’t bad. It’s a bit sharp on the nose though and it really needs a while to loose its punch. After some breath it reveals some apple, toffee and a hint of honey, but still tastes a bit sharp. I read a lot of very positive reviews, and saw some relative high rates, but for me it scores a solid two and a half, perhaps three, stars. Not bad at all, but not an instant favourite."

2.75,"Middle of the road NAS spey. Sweeter than most, plenty of toffee. Very slight hint of peatiness in the finish. Fair value when its on special offer in the supermarket, but for me more of a session whisky than one to savour."

3.75,"Orange is easily, pleasantly perceivable, and you can recall some JW through that. 
This is a great whisky to introduce people in your circle, but more experienced drinkers don't have to be snob and avoid it, a NAS scotch. it's tasty, well prepared, deep and complex enough. Everyday jewel."
3.75,Smooth as a very alcoholic baby's bottom.
2.75,The odour was sweety. The taste wasn’t strong and it was enjoyble to drink.

4.0,"77 is a little cruel; I would have given it something in the mid-80s. Ok... it doesn't excite, but it doesn't need to either. Sometimes all you want is a dram that isn't flawed and satisfies. The Gold Reserve does.

Applesauce and baked spice on the nose, with wood spices and cinnamon on the palate.

For 25€, worth it. Cheers!"
4.0,When this is in special at £25 it is a bargain. A great easy to drink dram
4.0,"Oct 2017
Drank in the Circle Tavern (smallest bar in Europe according to them) on Portland St, Manchester. Had at the end of a relatively quiet night after the Utd v Spurs game. My rating may be over-high due to 3 prior pints of Scarlet Red Ale 6% in the Grey Horse pub (next door to the Circle)."

3.25,"If there is such a thing, this is a session whisky.  One of the easiest drinking whiskies I know.  First sip is oak, biscuity and mid-sweet (toffee apple sweet rather than sugar).  There are some ginger and cinnamon spices on the short finish.  

From this expression you can tell that Cardhu is a major ingredient to Johnnie Walker blends, but this NAS does have its own character.  

It’s not a whisky that you’d likely be raving about, but it’s a nice, unassuming and easy to drink dram."

1.75,"Acetone, corn, and candy on the nose. Body is thin, and finish is short but not as bad as I expected--probably because it's 40%. Would not buy. 2019 Advent, day 11"
2.5,"Nose: pear, vanilla, baking spice, short bread, green apple 

Palate: almost watery, cardamom, short bread, oak, pear, vanilla 

Finish: very light and short finish, slight oak, brown sugar"
4.0,2019 advent: smells of toffee apple tastes of toffee gentle oak.
2.75,Pear and honey nose. Fruit Sweetness on the taste. Not much there.
2.5,"Nose is sweet light honey, orange, wood and some spice

Palate is sweet wood and a little spice

Finaish is short dry and oaky spice

Everyday dram"
3.25,"Not very complicated and easy to drink. Smooth. Honey, brown sugar sweetness and orange shows up in the medium range. Not much aftertaste but pleasant if brief finish. Good whiskey for an introduction."
