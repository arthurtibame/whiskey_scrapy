2.0,Tried a pour at a local tavern. Light and spicy describes this one accurately. Not much taste on the palate. Very simple. Most of the spice and burn is on the finish. Averaged dram at best.

2.25,"This isn’t a bad bourbon, it just wasn’t that good for me either. Not much on the nose, the body was rather medicinal to me. You do catch the rye spice and the alcohol burn on the finish. This is a one bottle try for me."
3.0,"[12.7.2018] I've probably owned this bottle since the first year 1792 had no age statement, but I honestly forgot about it in the basement. Broke it open tonight with a Balvenie-only friend to celebrate not being dead. Hindsight being 20/20, this probably wasn't the one. 

I appreciate the boldness up front but it leaves me wondering where the rest of the whiskey is. Higher proof, strong pepper and spice that left almost a burn feeling on the tip of my tongue. A little water seems to help; otherwise the flavor is shallow barrel tannins, spice, and herbal oils. I wouldn't buy this again for the price but heck, I don't remember buying it the first time."

4.0,"Mine is a 1792 ridgemont resererve store single barrel pick, NAS.  Initial straight tasting really highlights the high rye, nice spice followed by hints of caramel and vanilla, with a long finish.  Adding a few drops of water really opens up the sweeter notes."
