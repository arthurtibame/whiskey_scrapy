1.0,"smells very light and airy, fruity with vanilla. I also smell some candied fruits. Tastes kinda medicinal, with almost no alcohol bite until the finish"
4.0,Love all the flavors.
3.5,"Decided to dip into my box of samples tonight and came up with a curious one indeed. Sent to me by the ever so generous @LeeEvolved from his home state, Virginia Distilling Co. is producing American single malts, but this is not a single malt. Brewer’s Batch (batch 001) is a blend of their own single malt and a single malt sourced from an undisclosed Highland distillery in Scotland. Bottled at 46% ABV, natural color of a pale straw and its unknown if there is chill filtering, but I suspect there is some. This was finished in casks that held a Wee-Heavy ale from a local brewery. Those casks were first used to age the distillery’s whisky. A bit of a circle there. 

The nose is vibrant and fruity, intensely fruity even. Raisins and grapes, a definite sherry cask profile from the Highland scotch. Apricots, oranges, brown sugar, vanilla, toffee. Beautiful oaky notes, rich but not too sweet. The ale influence is quite minimal, but it is detectable in the form of an herbal/citrus hop aroma, which is mostly covered up by the sherry. Lemon and grapefruit, faint cocoa powder and barrel char. After a little more time in the glass the sherry really diminishes and the ale cask becomes more dominant. This brings a sourdough and slight mineral note. More time is not a friend to this whisky. 

The palate is a bit rough on the arrival, showing it’s youth. Green oak, a touch sour. Grape skins, light raisins, bright citrusy notes most likely from the ale cask finish. The sherry is well integrated with some sweetness and fruits. Oak tannins, light ginger, barrel char. Like the nose, time in the glass is not good for this whisky. Oxidization seems to really kill the sherry and brings on the youthful roughness. More time in the cask is needed. 

A medium bodied mouthfeel that is slightly oily, tongue coating and mouthwatering. 
The finish is medium long, a bit sour, light sherry and citrus, dry. 

This whisky was pretty darn good out of the gate, but struggled to cross the finish line in one piece. I don’t think an open bottle would hold up well to long periods of oxidization. At $65 this pretty pricy for what you get, but those scotch casks can’t be too cheap. I think this is a good starting point and subsequent batches should show improvement. 3.5
Cheers"
3.0,"I love getting to try local craft whiskey.  I really think it’s a true testament of gritty hard work, creativity, and passion.  But, their prices seem more on par with well aged malts, which is what I can’t seem to fathom for young whiskies and bourbon.  I got to try a sample of this thanks to a pour from @LeeEvolved.  I’m especially thankful, because this one here isn’t simply available in NJ.  You can clearly tell the passion that went into this—-it’s quality spirit, with strong aromas of fruit (specifically kiwi, stone fruits), followed by a crisp hint of beer and cereals.  Ideally suited for a nice sunny hot Virginia day.  It’ll be interesting to see where these guys go, as their whiskey becomes older and more refined.  Bar, Bottle Purchase, or Avoid...I’d say bar for this one.  I’d gladly buy a pour, but at $65, I can get a good young single malt or bourbon.  Thanks Lee!"
4.0,"This is the newest release from Virginia’s largest single malt whisky producer:  Virginia Distillery Co.  They are poised to become not only the largest whisky producer in Virginia, but the entire eastern seaboard of the US.  Until their stocks have aged properly they continue to blend some of their young stock with several undisclosed, Scottish Highland single malts and experiment with different finishing casks.  This is Batch 1 of the newest venture:  Brewers Batch.  They take the single malt blend and age it for another 8-9 months in previously filled barrels of Wee Heavy Scotch Ale from local, craft beer brewery Three Notch’d Brewing (Charlottesville, VA).

This whisky is pale yellow in color, is very oily and doesn’t leave many legs running down the taster.  It’s bottled at 46% ABV and doesn’t have any added color.  I’m not sure about the chill filtering, especially with the sourced Highland malt.  I suspect it is.

The nose is ridiculously fruity.  Clearly indicating a sherry cask aged source malt.  Vanilla cream candies mingle with the sherry notes and there’s a very light, charred oak backbone.  The palate is waxy with tons of orchard fruit again dominating the profile.  Vanilla and light citrus turn it to a dessert dram for sure.  The youthful, Virginia whisky aspect definitely leaves a bit of harshness behind by mid sip, but some nice oak notes help keep any abrasiveness in check.  The finish is warm and heavy on the spiced oak.  The harshness comes in again and is the only real negative aspect that stays past it’s welcome.  There is a lingering sweetness that makes this medium length in duration. 

Overall, this is miles above the port finished stuff they released last year.  It should be very interesting to see what these guys are capable of once their own stuff fully matures- especially if they can source some quality casks.  This is easily a 3.5 star dram, possibly reaching 4 on a good day.  The price point is borderline high, at $65, but that’s the price of local, craft whisky these days I suppose.  I’m looking forward to seeing what else these guys come up with in the future.  Cheers."
