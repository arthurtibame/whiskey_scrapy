4.0,"Had this in vegas June 2018 at scotch 80 prime paid $70 for 2oz pour paired it with a bison filet. Everything a typical octomore would present but not better than the 6.3 or 7.4. For that reason I wouldn't drop the $200+ on this bottle but if 6.3 and 7.4 become unicorns this may be the next best thing. """

5.0,"So here I am in an Orlando hotel room, laptop open working on a presentation deck, spicy Thai food for dinner, and —sin of all sins—-this beauty in a plastic cup.  It so deserved a proper glass...the plastic cup was just plain wrong.  But..that’s all I had.  Even though this has silly phenol  levels (309ppm), I still contend that ppm doesn’t necessarily equate to an equally hard peaty punch.  This has plenty...that’s not the point...but it doesn’t feel any more considering it’s maybe over double or triple of No Name and even 6x or 7x so more than a Lag16.   It doesn’t taste 7x “peatier’ than the Lag16.  That’s because chemically, the human nose starts to exponentially discern phenol levels less after 60ppm or so.  Instead, the nose will start to take in other aromas after that point.  It’s a simple evolutionary mechanism.  There’s really no natural reason to have that high sense of smell beyond 60ppm. So, is taking anything above 60-100ppm a simple marketing gimmick, considering humans can’t sense anything above that range?  Yeah.  Probably.    So...that brings us to this.  It won’t smell or taste any peatier than a Lag16 or Ardbeg 10, but it’ll bring other flavors and aromas to table instead.  While you get the bandaids in Laphroaig or brine and salt in Lagavulin or smoky embers in Ardbeg, this brings a bit of fruitier flavors.  You get some tropical fruit combimed with that initial peaty taste.  This is good.  Actually, damn good.  But...don’t go in expecting you’ll get a big peaty punch.  Your nose and palette simply isn’t evolved enough to notice."

3.0,"I'm not against heavily peated whiskeys in principle, but something about this just misses the mark for me. I ordered a 1½ ounce pour of this, and I could barely get all the way through; not because of overwhelming smokiness, but because of the smokiness coupled with 61% ABV! Don't get me wrong, there is nuance to this - beyond the obvious smoke and peat there's a background of subtle iodine mixed with sea salt, charred oak, and even a bit of rubber with a HUGE taste of tanned leather that appears out of nowhere right on the end, after you swallow. I had hoped to dilute the heat and bring more of these flavors out by adding a bit of water to the whiskey, but this only made it stick to my palate and leave the smoke and earth flavors to linger for longer and drown out more of everything else that, in my opinion, should have complimented the 309ppm phenol instead of being stuck playing second-fiddle to it. Worth trying just for it's uniqueness, but by no means something I could see myself regularly sipping."

Natural color
Non chill-filtered

Nose: bonfire/tire fire pest smoke goodness is in effect, but behind it reveals kiwi, cider apple, hint of pineapple along with pepper, caramel and vanilla.

Taste: Wow! bold, chili pepper hits immediately, building into a creamy, almost sorbet sweet fruitiness. There a hint of chocolate, too, which blends nicely. Also, sweet, sweet barley sugar and maybe a floral note, too? All in all nicely balanced and quite complex but a bit cloying for my taste.

Finish: medium, lead by pepper and smoke, with vanilla and some juicy fruits (plum, pear and blackberry) rounding it out and a slight cafe mocha at the tail end.

Value: at anywhere from $180-$250 dollars, I can’t say it’s worth the cost considering comparable options.

Final thoughts: as this was my first Octomore, I want to rate this higher. It’s damn good. The complexity intrigued me like few other young pleated single malts. It reminds me most of Arran Machrie Moor but with way more peat. But the cost is simply too much in my opinion. And my approach to reviewing includes cost as a factor. So while it’s a better peated malt than, say, Ardbeg 10 or Kilchoman Machir Bay or most core Laphroaigs, it’s a stretch to say it’s (at least) $100 better. 

Final score: 3.5/5 

(Recommend trying or buying a bottle at a good price.

H/t to @LeeEvolved for the generous sample. Thanks for sharing with me my first taste of the vaunted Octomore!"

4.25,"One of Bruichladdich's super heavily peated' whiskies at 309.1 ppm, compared to other typical Islay topping out at 40 ppm. The nose reflects the tar and heavy alcohol at 61.2%. Amazingly some of the sweetness still comes through. Typically drink in small sips with the taste of chocolate toffee quickly followed by the burn of alcohol and smoke. Enjoy for the uniqueness and the complexity under the peat. But not a drinking whisky and always the last drink of the day, leaving time for your taste buds to overcome the scorching."

4.25,"Oh, Octomore...it’s been too long.  I’ve always considered Octomore as THE love song to peatheads, like myself.  I’ve skipped a few vintages since I didn’t necessarily feel the need to try them all.  However, when Bruichladdich said the 8.3 Masterclass was the heaviest of them all, well I had to bite.  They knew I would- and I hate them for it.

This is just like your favorite Octomore- 5 years old and finished in multiple wine casks.  This one boasts Islay barley exclusivity (terroir, bitches) and comes in at 309ppm.  Can the human tongue even detect an amount that high?  I doubt it.  It looks good in print and on the packaging, though.

It’s standard yellow gold with thin droplets and skinny legs- thanks to the hearty 61.2% ABV.  You’ll think your local Dept of Transportation is paving your front yard as soon as the cork is popped.  Ah, fresh tar...

The nose is...(surprise!) fresh tar, burning tires and smoky alcohol.  Pepper burn stings a bit if you get too friendly too early.  Give it the time and distance it commands and you’ll pick up some nice, chocolate depth and rich, berry and plum sweetness- provided your nose works like it should.

The palate is smoked peppers and a heavy, malt burn.  Sugary toffee cremes really balance this out better than any Octomore I can remember.  It’s oily and super rich- grasping your tastebuds and attempting to pull them from your tongue.  Chocolate-dipped raspberries find their way into the corners of your mouth and do their best to counter the smoke and chili spices.  It works.  Really, really well.  The depth is amazing.

The finish is a bit rushed, as more chili and red pepper spice and heavy smoke coat everything.  The youthful juice finally reveals some harsh aspects, but you’ll be so focused on how to get the burn to subside you may not notice it.  The first few sips I had to restrain myself from reaching for some water to calm the fires.  

So, my first 2-3 drams were quite amazing here.  I was ready to proclaim this the best Octomore I’ve ever had.  Ready to score it a 6 on a scale to 5.  Then, the oxidation took hold and really deadened this bottle for me.  The final few drams seemed flat.  Still smoky, still warming, but the fire was out.  I started getting cola notes and soft, milky vanilla- which is something I don’t associate with Octomore.  It didn’t kill the score, per se, but it was no longer a 6- hell, no longer a perfect 5.  Like most Octomore I was sad to see the last few drops fall from the bottle, but my excitement fell with those drops.  Maybe I don’t need Octomore anymore.  I’m jaded.  At $192, I’m not sure it’s a great deal anymore.  Jesus, what’s wrong with me?  What have I become?  4.25 stars.  I’m sad to say that.  Cheers, my friends."

5.0,"My oh my, what a fine day in November this turned out to be. Last night I received an email from one of my preferred retailers announcing arrival of the Octomore 8 series along with the newest Compass Box releases (Phenomenology & No Name). Waking early with the excitement of a 4 year old on Christmas morning, I had the car gassed and ready to go. I made the mistake of taking a quick look at the Distiller app and reading Pranay’s review of CB No Name and thought, “This is it…..this is finally the day I come face to face with the king of peat!” Between Octomore 8.3 (309ppm) and Compass Box No Name, I was sure to get smacked in the face with a smoldering peat log. Returning home well stocked, I quickly unwrapped the two competitors and readied them for the showdown. The two rivals presented themselves well while facing each other in matching glencairns. No Name weighed in at 48.9% ABV and was wearing the light gold trunks, while Octomore 8.3 tipped the scale at 61.2% ABV and was sporting light copper trunks. Going nose to nose, No Name presented similar measures of smoky malted barley and elegant oak (American and French), both swirling in a luscious pool of ethanol. Octomore, on the other hand, was equal to No Name in toasted barley smokiness, but richer and fruitier based on a combination of bourbon-aged American oak and European oak previously saturated in a quartet of red wines from France. This additional boldness aided Octomore in winning a draw for this category.  On the palate both packed a hot punch with Octomore landing more solidly given its increased strength. With a multitude of peppery punches being thrown by both fighters, the audience was unable to discern a clear leader. Between rounds, both contestants were doused with the cooling effects of water and continued at a more tolerable pace in subsequent rounds. Here, No Name exhibited tarry elements of re-charring along with some dry, mild fruitiness, while the larger-than-life Octomore deftly maneuvered the ring throwing a complex assortment of jabs aimed at dried fruits, nuts, and barbequed clams. To this point, judges scored the fight even going into the final round. The finish proved to be well contested, with both aspirants going the lengthy distance in amazingly satisfying fashion. The audience showed their appreciation with a standing ovation lasting a full 5 minutes and one for each star registered. Both champions left the ring undefeated, but with trepidation that a king may still lurking in the wings awaiting discovery."

4.0,"This is the peatiest scotch ever at 300 bajillion parts per million!

The truth is that the Octomores are getting worse. The 6 series, in my opinion, was the pinnacle. Never tried 6.2, but the 6.1 is still the cheapest and one of the best octomores here in Maryland. The 6.3 is the best octomore I’ve had period. 

This 8.3 is pretty good. But not worth the price of my admission (241 USD). For peat heads, I agree that this is the peatiest thing I have ever tried, and I love peat, but I prefer a little more balance. 

Peat reek dominates the nose, with a tropical bend. Rotting mangoes and papaya being burnt on top of rotting vegetation. Pure detritus and hydrocarbons on the palate. There is a little bit of liquorice, which I don’t like, and associate with plastic and bad casks. The finish is ashy and savory. Smoked fish that was smoked again. And then smoked again. 

The sin on this whisky is that it tastes like it is too young. Previous X.3 Octomores are also 5 years old, but never did I get that impression. But, if you are looking for a peat bomb, this is the Tsar Bomba.  I would value this at 200 USD. I overpaid a tad. 

92/100"
4.0,"Regardless of other people's feelings about exactly how peaty the 309 ppm phenols make it taste, this is the smokiest whisky I've ever had. The bouquet actually isn't as dominated by smoke as other peated malts, there is also some room for chocolate covered fruit and tea as well. But the palate is ALL peat. Black pepper, campfire, jerky, bacon, and brine in spades. It's one of very few pours that I found myself coughing and clearing my throat even after multiple sips. It is a palate ruiner. Like a super hopped up IPA, you won't be able to enjoy eating or drinking much else right after. The high proof and lingering, coating smoke stick around for a long time. 

This is a fascinating novelty, and a must try (at least once) for peat fans. Given the high cost and extreme nature of this scotch, I can't say I'd see myself buying it again."

3.0,"With its 61% abv, this scotch will knock you right on your ass! It claims to be super peaty, but alcohol is the flavor that hits me strongest. It immediately makes me think of islay scotch mixed with vodka. Peatiest scotch in the world? I doubt that, though I can't deny that the peat flavor is strong. The fruitiness does stand out and is much appreciated. Usually, I taste mainly cherry from the Sherry cask, but in this case peach and apple are definitely present, along with a hint of mint and either butterscotch or maple. Maybe there is some mango in there too. The peat definitely has a chocolate taste to it. The finish is largely alcohol, chocolate, and mint, which is disappointing because this scotch initially has such a deep and interesting profile. At half that price, I could recommend this, but in the $200 range it seems like a stretch."

2.0,"Octomores are expensive.  I am a fan of Octomore.  Most of them are worth the price of admission.  This one is not.  Octomore has marketed themselves as the peatiest of all whiskies, and the 8.3 is the peatiest of all Octomores.  You would expect such a whisky to be unforgettable, but it is not.

Being a fan of peat is like being a fan of hot sauce.  If you are so inclined, there are plenty of hot sauces claiming to be at insane levels of heat, and they will hurt your palate, to be sure, but they are forgettable curiosities after the initial cataclysm on contact.  Octomore 8.3 offers much less depth than other Octomores, but, I agree, it is the peatiest.  This shit tastes like if your lung cancer got cancer.  Wheareas previous Octomores taste remarkably mature for their age, this one tastes like it is 5 years old, and there’s very little to draw from it rather than a hateful style of metallic Terminator T-800 peat.

I normally score the travel retail exclusive Octomores (x.2) as the worst Octomores, because I have a bias against TREs.  But when some TRE Octomores are tasted blind against 8.3, this is my least favorite Octomore.  However, I must still emphasize that I am a fan of Octomore, and I would still clearly consume this whisky if the price was right, valuing a bottle at $100.

Score: 0 (forgettable)
How much does a bottle cost: $200-250
How much do I think a bottle is worth: $100"
