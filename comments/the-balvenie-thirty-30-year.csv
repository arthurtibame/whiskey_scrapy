3.0,A let down in terms of presentation and flavor. The Tun series is much better and Macallan Rare blew it out of water. Still glad I did it but hindsight I would have picked another 30. This is from a balvenie regular

4.0,"So disappointing. The only thing I got in addition to the 21 was gasoline - or acetone, as the whiskey exchange says. Strange... 90 points, really not worth the crazy price"
