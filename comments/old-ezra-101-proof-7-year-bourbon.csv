4.0,"I paid a whopping $21 for this. My expectations matched the price - ""hey, if it's alright, then great; if not, it'll probably make a decent mixer."" I'll be doing my mixing with something else, let's just say. Bourbon, or at least budget-conscious bourbon, usually has a certain predictability to it. Caramel, vanilla, a little spice, a little bit of a rough-edged, young spirit energy and burn, not particularly complex. This ain't that stuff. No, Old Ezra's been aged long enough to have rounded off those rough edges - even at 101 proof, this is a smooth mamma-jamma with minimal burn...only a little tease of heat at the very end. That absence of burn makes it easier to enjoy the nose (vanilla, caramel, chocolate fudge, peanut butter, cinnamon...reminded me of those Turtles candies), and the palate. This...it's a unique flavor. A local creamery makes a killer chocolate peanut butter ice cream (with a BIG ribbon of real peanut butter in it..it's exquisite), and that's what this reminds me of. A sweet, creamy vanilla base, with milk chocolate, peanut butter, cinnamon honey, and a little hint of caramel. Amazingly, it's not overly sweet despite all of this.  I'm really impressed, but you shouldn't go out and buy it. I, rather selfishly, want the price point on this to stay nice and low...I just saw Larceny selling for $40 a bottle, so we know what happens when too many people start talking. If this were at a higher price point, I'd call it a 4 star bourbon, but for $25 or less? That merits an extra star just for value."

4.0,I bought this earlier today for $24.99 and I must say I'm extremely surprised at its profile! It's a nice solidly aged HH product at a nice 101 proof almost reminds me of a EW BiB if it was 7yrs old instead if that makes sense. Liked this much better than the HH 6yr BiB

3.0,"Nose - Oaky, barrel aged vanilla, hint of bananas, caramel, cocoa nib bitterness.

Taste - Oaky vanilla caramel, nice cinnamon spice, light fruity bitter like very unripe plantains.

Finish - Lingering cinnamon burn that transitions into a lightly drying oaky vanilla simple, the caramel richness is gone and is replaced with a lightly bitter fruity tartness.

Score - 71/100

Final Thoughts - This is a very inoffensive bourbon and to a certain extent kind of reminds me of a higher proof Jack Daniel's. It has this odd banana-like quality in addition to the typical ""bourbon"" notes, although this one seemed a bit on the oaky side which I normally don't mind, but it just seemed a bit boring. This isn't bad neat, but I think I'll delegate this one to mixing or maybe baking into my banana bread as it already has hints of banana in it.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - Not again, good but there are better/more interesting bottles in this price range"

4.0,"Good nose, classic bourbon, fresh and pleasant. No sting given the proof. On the palate, good rush of flavor, wood spice and orange peel, light honey. Decent finish. Heaven Hill profile. Punches above its weight (great budget bourbon). 7/30/17
Could smell this all day. Rice crispy treats with extra butter and caramel, a bit of nutmeg. On the palate, a good kick, wood spice, just enough sweetness, citrus zest, salt, pecan shells, and a lingering warmth. A bit of leather at the end to remind you of its legitimacy. Medium weight, some chew to this. Complex. Great value bourbon. 8/2/17"

3.0,"3.5, not more, carmel, some vanilla and some spice not better than wt101, paid $18, great if under $15. Better on some ice......

After a pour of oz  decided to pour wt101 ......it sure is better, no doubt about it."
3.5,very pleased with this one. it's a steal at $15.99. A little thin but still great flavor

3.5,"Old Ezra 101 aged for 7 years.   

As Luxco will most likely take over production of the Old Ezra label bourbon when their distillery comes online, and as that may very likely effect quality,  I quickly snatched up a bottle of this I found on the sale rack at one of my locals.   At an even ten spot this bottle is not just a find but a helluva deal!

Right off the top this has the nose of a classic bourbon featuring the oak, vanilla, caramel sweetness that has come to define the genre.  At 50.5% abv, it's impossible not to notice the pure strength of this juice, but make no mistake this is no young, green outsourced produce from some corn state, this is THE REAL DEAL from Heaven Hill.  The classic bourbon notes are backed with hints of fruits and citrus with some leathers and almonds and nutmeg balanced in the sweet and burnt sugars, this is actually a far more complex offering than most reviews will credit it for, which may be a product of bias from an off sourced brand even if we know that source is a top quality one. 

I get and odd ginger and nut finish with no burn or notable heat even at the near bib strength, the oak and vanilla linger on to remind you again, this dram hails from the place bourbon was born and perfected. The rye-barley mash percentage works well to supplement just the right amount of spice to the sweet bourbon corn base,  to yield a balance of tasty bourbon. 

Oddly this bourbon seems considerably better in every way than the Heaven Hill 6 year bottle in bond and reminds me of why I like Larceny but still wish it had more age on it,  finding more of a  Henry McKenna similarity than anything.  

 Figuring I might use this for making sours and manhattans if it wasn't a good stand alone candidate, both uses it would no doubt serve well at, this turns out to be a find and if you see it below 15USD you have found yourself a nice deal to take home smiling.   Cheers!"

3.75,"Sweet wheat then a bit of rye/pepper(?) in this, along with nice warmth from the 50.5%, followed by slight cherry mid with oaky dry finish. Pleasant and smooth for a 101,  mid-level bourbon. One of the best I've had between $20-$35."
3.5,"Solid high-proof Bourbon, tastes much better than its $20 price point."
2.0,I had high hopes for this considering the buzz around the barrel proof version. This one is very thin with a wet cardboard finish that lingers. That off note doesn’t go away in old fashioned either. Skip it.

4.0,"Nose: With this one I get orange peel, Oak, Corn, Brown Sugar, and a dose of ethanol. You definitely pick up on the Heaven Hill lineage in this Luxco product. 
Neat: Thick and clingy mouthfeel. Salty with dry roasted peanuts, citrus, maple syrup, and cinnamon. The finish is astringent with oak and black pepper. 
Splash: a few drops of water really bring the orange/citrus note to the front. It tones down the astringency, but really amps up the black pepper spice. 
3 3/4 stars, but I'll round up. I liked this one, but believe that I prefer the drier, less spicy Ezra Brooks 90pf. This one is not available in NC, but I worked out a swap with someone for some Virgin 101 (rumored to be the same stuff, but I find it a little sweeter and less spicy). I think the Old Ezra Barrel Proof is supposed to get a wider distribution. I look forward to trying it."
3.5,"Nose: 3.5 | vanilla, dust
Palate: 3.75 | very nice mouthfeel; vanilla, oak, leather; easy drinker for the proof
Finish: 3.5 | mid-length finish; oak and slight spice 
Price: 4 | another great value bourbon; sadly discontinued but will be replaced by Ezra Brooks 7 Year Barrel Strength 

Verdict: Bottle 
Great daily drinker.  Hoping I can find a few more of these before they disappear forever..."

1.5,"Nose: dusty old wooden bookcase (weird I know lol), smells like a less sweet Jack Daniels on first smell
Taste: salty, slight citrus, not very complex, not sweet, pretty thin, more burn than I would like...

Not a fan of this one neat (better on ice). Would probably be decent in a mixed drink!"
1.5,"Slight vanilla notes on the nose underneath a dusty charcoal-esk aroma. Briney and salty taste, a little tartness and a little spice. Thin, not oily, though the finish still lingers a bit. It’s like if Evan Williams and Jack Daniels had a baby."
3.25,Not bad for the price.  Carmel vanilla with a warm finish. Added a drop of water and brought out more cinnamon flavor

3.5,"Great for the price. 
Nose- sweet grainy
Taste- leathery
Finish- medium that builds to the point you think it's good but dissapates."
3.25,"Nose: not much there to begin with with a mild sweetness and wet oak smell. No alcohol burn.
Palate: sweet caramel gives way to slight pepper. Medium body. 
Finish: leaves tongue moderately dry. Slight alcohol letting you know it’s relatively young. Quick finish. After taste of pepper and wheat. 
Overall a pleasant sipper with a touch of peppery-ness,"

3.25,"Had the Ezra 90pf and enjoyed it quite a bit. Great value. Saw this on closeout for $17.99 so why not. Neat, color is several shades darker than the 90 pf. Has good legs and glass coat. Noses caramel, vanilla and some dusty resin... fuller than the 90. For 101pf ethanol is not an issue. Palate is similar to EB90 with nutty caramel, pepper and oak but extra proof and age have amped it up. Carries more heat for sure but sweetness is increased, This is similar to Old Forester100(not as good though), I like it. Medium finish with cinnamon nutty oak and caramel. Not as dry as EB90. Its bolder and deeper with the 101 kick. For the money this is excellent. Ezra Brooks is a can't miss imo 90 or 101. Overall this is better than the standard 90pf imo(I did side by side tasting). I appreciate the extra age, robust flavor bump and lessening of dryness. 83/100.......... However, I can understand going with the 90pf as it is less $$ and still very good."
