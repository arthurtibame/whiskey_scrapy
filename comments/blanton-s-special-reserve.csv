2.0,Very ordinary in my opinion. Thin on the palate with only the briefest of finishes. Some spice provided by the rye but not much of anything else.  Woodforde reserve or Evans and Williams Black label both vastly superior offerings at the price point.

3.0,"Bourbon time. On the nose I get a ton of cherry and vanilla. There are some spices in there and a hint of pepper. On the tongue I get bitter oak flavors combined with some sweetness and the typical cherry vanilla. The aftertaste doesn't last very long and is a mix of sugary sweetness and bitter oak. Not my favorite Bourbon, but would probably work nice in an Old Fashioned. Need to try that."

2.0,Rather boring. Some people call this Blandton's. I can understand why. No need to buy a full bottle.
5.0,M'y favorite bourbon...

5.0,"Awesome whiskey with touch of vanilla and slightly citrusy nose.Thick and smooth, light spicy finish."
2.0,I believe this is a Blanton's that is only available outside of the USA. I bought it in St Kitts. This is a decent bourbon. Too weak for my taste. Only 80 proof.
4.0,Un classique indémodable. Voici LE bourbon qui fait aimer le bourbon. Ces garantit!

3.5,"Blantons is my type of bourbon. Original, gold and now reserve. Some things i need to think about when rating. This was yup it's a 4. Cherry vanilla oak as the Rev noted. Cheap for the quality at under $60USD here. Update: 11/04/18 Interestingly I had another dram of this and my thoughts are similar to the Revs this time round. Not sure if its me or batch variation. Would be more a 3.5"

3.75,Nose is very light but very reminiscent to he original Blantons bottle. Sweet with a little burn on the nose. Very good taste it basaclly reminds me of a lighter Blantons. If I was able to get this regularly for cheaper than Blantons I would purchase it.

5.0,"A staple bourbon. 40% and incredibly easy to drink. Vanilla custard, creme caramel, toasted oak, and just a slightest hint of char come together in a very smooth bourbon. Grain sweetness up front, mild complexity, and very balanced."
3.0,"Palpably less interesting than the richer, creamier original version. But for the $50 you’ll find it going for in Australia, it’s tough to beat. Smooth at the start, smooth at the finish. Ideal for when you’re in the mood for a neat bourbon that won’t challenge your delicate senses."

4.0,Blanton “lite”.  I enjoyed it even if I had to import it from France.
4.25,Very smooth. It’s scary how fast you could go thru a bottle. Not as spicy as the gold. Has a deer finish.
4.25,really smooth finish

4.0,Very smooth taste profile. Neat- smooth vanilla taste with a hint of char. On the rocks- more vanilla and less burn but still super smooth.
