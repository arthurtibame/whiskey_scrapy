4.0,"We had this scotch at the same time as we tried Aberlour 12, and it stood out as seeming to be richer, with fuller, darker flavors, and a thicker texture, than that scotch.  That's a pretty big surprise considering that it actually is more diluted.  This is a clear leap above the mediocre Glenfiddich 12.  The nose has some sherry influence as well, and dark, brown sugar aromas.  On the palate, it's a sweet, wine-influenced whisky, but with a buttery sweetness that reminds of a cinnamon roll (albeit with most of the spice brushed off) or a beignet.  The finish is relatively short, with mild, malty flavors."

4.0,"This week I'm doing something different. 5 days, 5 whiskies from the same Distillery: Glenfiddich. Starting with the 15 (because for some reason I have in the back of my mind that I didn't like the 12...). This is a fruit bomb. On the nose you are greated with a base layer of honey, topped by a boatload of apples and pears with a dash of cinnamon. This has to be the fruitiest whisky I smelled so far...fresh, juicy apples, you could swear this is apple juice. And this continues on the taste. Honeyed apples with a hint of chocolate and a suggstion of smoke. All in all, light, fruity, moderatly sweet. This is what Speyside stands for in my opinion. The honeyed apples stay quite a while. This is a relax whisky, and a great baseline for my tasting week. Looking forward to the 18 tomorrow. Cheers."

3.0,"During a business trip in Germany last year, the hotelbar had only about a handfull of whiskies to choose from. The only ones I hadn't tried yet, were this one and the Oban 14. While I like the idea of the Solera system, I expected this 15 year old expression of Glenfiddich to be a significant step up from the standard 12 year old, but while it was not bad at all, I also didn't find it to be very special either. A good decent dram, similar to the 12 year old, except for some more fruityness."

- Método solera, padronização entre lotes

Olfato: leve, cítrico, maçãs, ligeiramente acre, frutado, floral (ao tampar a taça e abrir sente-se com mais facilidade), malte, caramelo, amadeirado, manga verde, uvas passas, mel, baunilha, dulçor, notas de ex-sherry, ex-bourbon e sem indícios de álcool.

Palato: doce do malte, suave, mel, passas, chocolate, baunilha, maçãs, notas de sherry e bourbon evidentes, assim como as notas do barril virgem bem presentes. Picante, um pouco de canela, açúcar mascavo e bom amargor.

Finalização: média para longa, com dulçor, amargor e picância bem balanceados.

Impressões gerais: whisky leve e divisor de águas, caso você venha do mundo dos blends. Leve e ao mesmo tempo complexo e saboroso. Se este whisky tivesse 43% e não fosse filtrado a frio a explosão de sabores seria maior. Entretanto, estamos falando de um ótimo single malt, facilmente encontrado no Brasil, que entrega o que você paga e que tem um preço que não é alto para um whisky de 15 anos. Recomendo degustação em taça de whisky e sem adição de água ou gelo."

While not the worst of the three it was the most disappointing. The nose was mildly interesting, comprised of sherry notes (dark fruits) and red apple.  Similarly, I found the taste to be a little simple: a hot arrival levelling out to a dry, sherry taste, but the sweet and spicy finish was perhaps the highlight. A few drops of water took some bite off the front but didn't open up anything extra, I thought.

Side note: Rather than a Glencairn I used a Túath Irish whiskey glass I got at WhiskeyLive Dublin. It’s a new design that looks well enough and handles fine. It’s main drawback is a flared rim which, despite the marketing blurb, does not “elegantly sit on the surface of the lip”. It requires a significant head-tilt to wet your whistle!"

Super smooth taste that grows in complexity as it sits on the tongue. Perhaps some smoke and leather on the finish. Adding water moves the finish flavors up to be experienced earlier in the taste. A pleasant sip indeed.

A true toughie but a classic one. Deep, hard, intense and very solid. It has everything in moderate - both sweet and dry enough."

3.75,"Nose: almost brandied in its sweet, fruity richness. The whisky character is still present but there are elements there that strongly remind me of certain cognacs; prune and dried apricots are the most obvious. Maybe a touch of coconut as well. Very warm and inviting.

Palate: Drier and a little more astringent than the nose would suggest, although still definitely on the sweet side. Lots of dried and candied fruit (orange peel, raisins, dried apricots, maybe dates) under a dusting of warm spices. I can also taste a touch of chocolate. It's got a jovial, Christmas-y feel.

Finish: medium, with strong notes of caramel and a whisper of smoke.

This is not the type of whisky towards which I usually gravitate, but someone gifted it to me and I'm actually glad they did. It's got a satisfying chewiness and a sweet warmth that make it easy to like. I'm almost sure I'll finish the bottle, even though I'm unlikely to repurchase it."

Finish is rather short, but interesting, with lemon zest, vanilla, and an oaky-nutty, a bit bitter aftertaste. A few drops of water open even more fruit on the palate, but don’t seem to do too much for this 40% ABV whisky. Overall, this is a very round, smooth, and complex dram that can be greatly enjoyed."

4.0,"Glenfiddich 15 is a well known and easy to find single malt with some rich enjoyable flavors. I think this used to be 43% ABV in the US but unfortunately it looks like it’s 40% now. The color is dark brown and looks too unnatural.

You can find many dried fruits in the nose like raisins and figs. There are also a few nuts and weak spices in the background. 

The palate is sweet and creamy with brown sugar and vanilla. The finish is nice with leather and toffee. 

This is a good step up from the Glenfiddich 12 and a great recommendation for beginners. The flavors are rich, but not complex. While this whisky is enjoyable to drink, it’s not something I’d buy again at this price point."

3.5,"Ex bourbon notes are covered with delicious sherry dry fruit notes. Floral notes is just floating in and out in between. Everything is just light not heavy.

American oak wood, charred, bitterness started to show on your palate a lot more intensely and vividly where it was hidden away on the nose. All the goodness of bourbon sugary notes and wonderful dry fruit sherry notes all started to fade away from foreground to background until you left with a bit dry and a bit bitterness almost like a black tea even and some spicy notes in your month.

Once you had couple of sip, sherry notes and American oak will be more prominent on the nose.

There is too much American oak notes in there for me to love it. I like it but I don't love it."

This whisky is very good, on the nose you get a little herbal like mint notes, honey, but most of it is caramel or vanilla. You will the get the impression it is going to be sweet but actually the sweetness is only for a second in your palate. After that second, you will get a full bodied peppery sensation, very strong which will leave your mouth hot and dry. actually it is a beautiful drink, i've enjoyed it a lot.  89 over 100"

4.0,"On the heels on my review of the 12 year, I think now is a good time to tackle its older brother. The 15-year Solera. On an interesting concept; as a result a good portion of this juice is well older than 15 years old. Ex-bourbon, ex-sherry, virgin oak. Let's check it out.

Nose: Heavy vanilla, caramel, and orange citrus. Honey, toffee, ginger, and oak. Classic Fiddich apple, pear, and apricot, kiwi, and floral notes. Graham cracker and walnut. Some golden raisin and white grape, but otherwise, not a huge sherry presence. Maybe a bit of cranberry. The Bourbon cask definitely exerts the most prominent influence on the nose. I read French Toast on the internet. Not my note, but it it's undeniable that's there. Good start.

Palate: It's a fruit bowl. Apple, pear, orange, plum, apricot, golden raisin, fig, date, cranberry, white and red grape. A lot going on there. A bit of cola and some chewy caramel. I'm getting some those raspberry-flavored Valentine's chocolates (don't even know what else to call it). Big toffee, big malt, plenty of vanilla and oak. The sherry and bourbon oak share the load this time around. I've got little experience with Virgin Oak, so I'm going to leave that out of my analysis. Good stuff.

Finish: Some dark fruit (cranberry, date, fig, raisin), coupled with vanilla and toffee. More of the apple, pear, and kiwi. A bit of a cinnamon and oak kick. It's somewhere between short and moderate length, leaning toward the latter. Not all that long, but there's plenty of complexity while it lasts.

Another 4 star outing for Glenfiddich. To me, they offer a very consistent product. But as long as they're bottling at 40%, they'll never crack the threshold that divides very good and great. The 14 remains the best of the age-stated GFs I've tried, and, no coincidence, it's bottled at 43%. Honestly, I think all of these could use a 3% bump to really achieve their potential.

While they cut corners on the proof here, they certainly did not hold back on the aged-stock. The Solera aging method works wonders here. It's a refined yet flavorful expression; I think the interplay between multiple generations of malt makes for a fantastic product. Great job here Glendfiddich; I doubt you'll ever increase the ABV on  your products because, ultimately, the bottom line rules. So I've heard. At any rate, thanks for a solid bottle."
4.0,"Apple juice and raisins.  The unique Solera maturation produces a very smooth, balanced, and easy sipping sherry-cask scotch.  I will always keep a bottle of this on my shelf, because it reminds me of what I was looking for in an ideal sherried whisky when I first started my scotch exploration.  There's none of the sulfur elements or heavy wood presence, to detract my attention away from the simplicity of everything I enjoy in a daily, sherried dram.

Finish: Medium-long. Smokiness lingers and keeps it interesting. Oaky and sweet.

Overall Thoughts: This is a delightful dram. Glenfiddich rarely disappoints me and the 15 certainly holds that to be true. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a Scotch that doesn’t try too hard to be bold. It’s a sweet one that is easy to relax with."
