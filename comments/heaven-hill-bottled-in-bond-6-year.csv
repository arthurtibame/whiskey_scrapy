3.0,"The nose takes you back to Heaven Hill rick houses.  If you've ever done the tour, you'll know what I mean.  Very smooth with a slight burn at the end.  Tremendous value for a 100 proof 6 Year old bourbon. Definitely a household staple for cocktails.  Challenge fellow bourbon drinkers to blind taste test this one against much more expensive brands and see what happens.  They'll be surprised when you reveal the price."

4.0,"On the nose you will be reminded of a rickhouse: if you've ever toured one this will take you right back there.   The palate and finish is not terribly complex but still satisfying, especially when considering the price point. Any ""everyday bourbon"" or ""table bourbon"" should be weighed against this, and will probably not fare well."

3.0,"Nose - Sweet vanilla caramels, old cinnamon, faint peanut brittle, touch of leather.
Taste - Fairly thin but drying, sweet vanilla caramel, hint of peanut brittle sweet, cinnamon/white pepper spice, hint of bitter peanut shells, faint dried cherry sweet at the very end.
Finish - Long lingering cinnamon/white pepper spice, slowly fades to a oaky vanilla brown sugar simple sweet, hint of peanut shell bitterness lingers.
Score - 75/100
Final Thoughts - Overall a decent bonded bourbon. Fairly boring nose but makes up for it on the palate. I enjoy the vanilla caramel notes with the spice, but the peanut shell bitterness is a little offputting, although the slight dried cherry finish helps. It's a decent bourbon overall, wouldn't turn down a pour at a bar. I can see this being a great mixer for pretty much everything while still being able to hold its own neat or with some ice."

4.0,"Salt, nuts, burnt sugar, and fragrant spice on the nose. Lots there. A bit of heat on the palate, then a rush of honey roasted nuts, mint, and clove. Cinnamon as well. The spicy finish is medium in length, with a hint of bitterness and herbs. The sweetness stays consistent throughout. The great price on this bottle is a bonus - the quality of this juice stands on its own, it's quite tasty. Factor in the value and this is a must have in your bar (worth a trip to Kentucky to buy a case or two). 11/27/17"

4.0,You know if I did this review blind and without price as a concern I'd honestly rate this as a solid B bourbon . In all honesty I would rather have this as my everyday than BT or anything like that . It's unfortunate that I have to snag the bottle when I make a road trip through Kentucky. But at the price I will buy me a case next time I go back

2.5,"Apparently the 6 year 100 proof is currently unavailable, or limited for exporting from KY, they have released a 3 year 80 proof in its stead.  That's a wee step down and you should consider the Mckenna (also from Heaven Hill) 4 year brown bottles are still around before picking this one. 
          
  That said this is a Heaven Hill quality product and brings the required characteristics to the table.  The nose is so mild I switched to my jigger sized snifter to get a better feel for it.  Its almost exactly what any bourbon old timer would expect, a small straight alcohol fume with sweet oak and mild caramel/vanilla.  Just what you expect from the HH family of distillers in a bourbon this young, nothing flashy, just basic, acceptable bourbon. 
          
  Relatively mild this one is easy to roll on the tongue and sample the sweet caramel body before it finishes with a nice warm and slightly salty cinnamon tapering off.  Again absolutely nothing spectacular but still a modest yet respectable mid section not quite rich but almost all there.  A 3 year drinker you can enjoy straight or use as a quality mix base and just as important SOMETHING worthy of putting the Heaven Hill name on the label.  2.5 stars for a drinkable bourbon at a entry level price point."

The taste profile proved to be very versatile as I have had it neat, on the rocks, and mixed without being disappointed. The initial heat of the 100 proof hits, but then is followed by a nutty, caramel sweetness that is followed by a final dash of heat. 

This being a 100 proof product, I enjoy the way the taste evolves with a single large ice cube."

Finish: balanced and smooth finish

Reminds me of McKenna 10, and since this is now discontinued I can imagine they will be using more of the spirit to go into McKenna. But honestly this is better than the McKenna I’ve tasted. It’s better than the current NAS Elijah Craig. So maybe those two will improve with the stock that was originally intended for the 6-year bottled in bond. Who knows."

4.0,"Medium amber in the glass.  Legs start quickly but linger.  Moderate viscosity.

A mild nose.  Vanilla with a hint of peanut.  Traditional bourbon smell, especially HH products.

Starts sweet.  Green apple, peanut, a touch of char, nice splash of mint and proof spice on the edges of the tongue and then building through the long finish.  Lingering cinnamon, cedar, and minty iodine.

Impressive, bold, balanced, and nuanced for the price point.  Plenty of character without ever being rough.  Would stand up beautifully in a spirit-forward cocktail.  A lost gem - we’ll see what its 7-year replacement is and costs soon!"

This discontinued bourbon is fantastic. Especially at the price point it once was sold. From the honey and sweet corn nose to the spicy oak finish, an underrated bourbon if there ever was. 

Nose: honey, mint, tea, oak, butterscotch 

Palate: rich with more butterscotch, spicy vanilla, hints of toffee

Finish: not too brittle, not too creamy; quite balanced for a bottom shelf whiskey

This was a hidden gem in Kentucky until they discontinued it. A shame."

3.75,Best bargain whiskey I’ve tried. Should cost 2-3 times as much (and probably will).
3.5,"Sadly, Heaven Hill 6-Year Bottled-in-Bond was too good for this world.  Farewell, sweet whiskey unicorn!  This expression was a long-time Kentucky exclusive that nailed a rare trifecta for that lucky state's bourbon lovers: high quality, great value, and a clear age statement.  In fact, it was such a good value that many people claimed that it was Heaven Hill Distillery's small ""thank you"" to the people of its home state.

 Compared to other Heaven Hill expressions, this one is a little different.  It combines what I think of as Jim Beam funk -- roasted peanuts and anise -- with Buffalo Trace fruitiness -- orange rinds, tangerines, and mandarins.  Yes, it's almost every orange-colored fruit in the citrus family in a dense and heady mixture.  Light honey and those orange citrus fruits dominate the palate by far, along with some cereal grain and corn.  The most notable absence in this bourbon is vanilla.  If someone served this to me over an ice cube, I'd assume it was an Old Fashioned."
3.25,Nice nose gives way to a lot of burn.
3.25,"Here is one of most sought out bottom shelf bourbons of all time.  It is Heaven Hill 6 Year Old Bottled in Bond.  This one has been discontinued by Heaven Hill but I still see it at several places in Kentucky when I am there.  Distributors must have a ton of it still in there warehouses.  It also was/is a Kentucky area release only.  It used to be about 9-12 bucks all day long.  Now when I do see it, it runs 20-23 bucks.  It is the standard Heaven Hill mashbill 75% corn, 13% rye, and 12% malted barley.  The color is brownish amber.  The legs are thin and start to run fast but then slow down.  The nose is sweet corn, vanilla, and lots of oak.  The palate is the same as the nose but with some alcohol.  But as you sip on it the alcohol dissipates and it is just enjoyable.  It coats your mouth very nice with a almost creamy sensation.  The finish is medium to long and the flavors linger with the oak hanging in there.  I would say since this one is getting very hard to find a great alternative is the Evan Williams Bottled In Bond which I have already reviewed but added it below.  It is a solid bourbon that is available everywhere."

3.5,"This one reminds me of Evan Williams Bottled in Bond, in price and in flavor. Classic bourbon tasted, proofed well at 100 proof, but notably sweeter than Evan White Label. 

Nose: alcohol, corn, vanilla, caramel

Palate: classic bourbon notes of oak, vanilla, caramel, but also unique lingering sweetness

Finish: warm, rich, and medium length

The fact that this is a $15 age stated Bottled in Bond is incredible. Sad to see it was discontinued. I’m stocking up."

Palate- Wave of caramel, walnuts, rye spice, washed over by alcohol

Finish- Short, mouth tingling finish with notes of caramel and a bit of wet oak 


The nose is the most impressive aspect of this bourbon, albeit covered up with ethanol. The palate is pretty one dimensional, with a good amount of heat, and the finish is short. Yes, this is cheap, but there are much better buys. 10/10 I would pay $5-10 more for a bottle of buffalo trace."
