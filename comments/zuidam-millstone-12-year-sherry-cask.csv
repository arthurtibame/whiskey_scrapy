4.5,"A Dalmore Doppelganger. It reminded me of that internet meme of the two spidermans pointing at each other. Amazing dram. Delicious and almost a 5.0. Beautiful packaging too. Did i mentiom this is dutch? From the netherlands? A truly interesting single malt. 

Bottled at 46%. Cant remember the color i had too many by the time i wrote my notes of this.

On the nose: it is a Dalmore! 
Wedding cake. Sherry,  raisins, figs. 

On the palate: It is a Dalmore!
Wedding cake, christmas cake, super oaky,  candied fruit. Delicious. Finish full of liquorice, very pleasant.

Overall i give this dram a 94 over 100 and i truly think it deserves more and i am not been fair here. Go find it."

3.25,"This is an interesting distillery. There is the same note that goes through this dram similar to its brother I tried weeks ago. The distiller reviewer described it as marmalade, maybe that maybe a hint of cough syrup which is prevalent on the after taste. It's the type of note which makes me usually round down to a 3 and I can see how others might. I'm not sure even if the balance is quite there with the alcohol either but there is something I like about this. Even after that I was trending to a 3.75 but now I'm not sure. I'm thinking maybe a 3.25 with the aftertaste. I preferred its more boltchie rye based brother I think."
