4.25,"Nose: Toffee, custard, angel food cake, underlying orange peel and soft barrel notes.

Palate: Rich, butter pecan tarts, gingerbread cookies, orange zest, hint of nutmeg.

Finish: Medium-short, soft vanilla and more orange peel with a sprinkle of baking spices."
5.0,"First came in mouth, feels like some 12 or 15 year old whisky, but relays with a deep oak and sweetness."

3.5,"Vanilla taste very present, with cinnamon and mayber honey? Smell of vanilla, and oak but not the honey surprisingly. 
Quite heavy on the tongue and oaky. Not very salty, good sweetness. Very good and accessible even for it's 46.3% ABV which are not feelable. Not smoky at all."

4.0,"Honey, bananas, and slightly earthy note emerge, but otherwise a relatively weak nose. This whisky comes alive on the palate with a mouthwatering citrus, hazelnut and milk chocolate taste. Warm and fruity finish lingers on with a hint of ginger spice. Very good whisky overall."
4.0,"This is some really good stuff, and a highly complex palate makes up for a subdued nose. There are aromas of ginger and nuts with a touch of spring blossom and dark chocolate. It's all really well balanced and full to the mouth, with a long and smooth finish. I highly recommend!"

4.5,"Fantastic whisky, it’s not a smack you in the face type whisky, but it has subtle complex flavours and the finish is my favourite part , it goes on with sweet and spice notes . I would definitely recommend this one !"
4.0,"This is my second posting on this expression. It gets better and better. This is a low key easy , smooth drinking scotch that after sipping on it for awhile you realize how amazing this is how subtle the flavours are but how it holds your attention almost subconsciously. Great scotch."

2.5,"Warms you up, full-powered, good nose, a bit generic, harsh for an 18.

3.5,"This is a solidly made whisky; not overly complex or dynamic but tasty nonetheless. 

The flavor profile is graham cracker, warm honey, sweet cream butter, and toasted marshmallows.

I bought this bottle about 5 months ago and I’m now 3/4 through it. This has gotten better over time but it’s still not a wow whiskey. I’ve only had two Deanstons - the 18 and the 14 organic but have found both to be a little underwhelming. Some of this may be related to the hype and my expectations; who knows. I also haven’t tried anything matured in sherry so maybe that is an avenue to explore."

4.25,Very enjoyable easy dry bit peppery at first but let it air out for 20 min and it mellows. Still exploring all the tasting notes. This is one that I keep reaching for. Deanston is becoming a real go to for me. The 12 and 18 will always be in my collection.

4.0,"interesting dram, the flavours are slightly muted but open up over time. burnt toffee and caramel is the predominant characteristic accompanied by slight aniseed,  marzipan, grass and green apple, spicy oak notes. A fair bit going on here and it definitely grew on me the more I got into it. I tried the Laphroaig An Cuan after and this dram made it taste pretty  one dimensional so I bumped this up a notch and downgraded the Laphroaig."
3.5,"the first offering (and only to date) from Deanson that i had the pleasure of tasting.
Its price back then (58€ on MofM) made me go for it. 

Do i regret it? not at all, since it is a perfect pour for warmer evenings when you need a good dram. 

Would i buy it again? at that price, most definitely, especially since Deanston afficionados kept saying how better the new core range (the white labels, not that brown one depicted on Distiller, that happens to be the one i bought) has become. However, for 80 euros, i could buy an Aultmore 18 or a Craigellachie 17, two easy sippers that i tend to favour over this one."

3.75,"Nose: Spiced honey with vast quantities of malt extract, grassy cereal notes, orchard fruits and a hint of vanilla. Spiky at first but gaining sweetness as it opens. Adding a tiny drop of water expands the honey considerably.

Palate: A malty, leathery and oily arrival that is lightened by floral honey notes and simultaneously lit up by cheeky ginger spice. Cereal flavours thunder forth in the development - bread, madeira cake, fruit muffins, buttered crumpets with orange marmalade and a dusting of nutmeg. There are some very agreeable mild chocolate and nutty tones as well.

Finish: Medium. Sweet cereal flavours that trail into pleasantly dry tannic notes followed by a malty aftertaste.

Deanston is a distillery that didn't give me a good initial impression, but as I'm tasting more of their expressions I'm starting to warm to them. My first taste was a post-tour flight at the distillery a few years ago and maybe it just wasn't the right moment.  The core range left me with the feeling that they have a hard, sharp distillate that is not being matured as well as it might.

Perhaps it's just the greater age of this particular expression, and/or maybe a better quality of casks, but I'm definitely on board with this crisp and excellently clean malt-bomb. Some people have criticized the nose as being shy but for me it was the best part of the experience (however you need to give it some time).

The palate is a hair's breadth lower in quality but a drop of water brings it up to scratch and unleashes considerable honeyed sweetness. It also adds some spice to the finish, which is a comfortable addition. I'd definitely say that this whisky is not merely improved by watering, it actively needs it to become really enjoyable and achieve balance.

Deanston is not just geographically a highland whisky, it is absolutely of that broad style. This expression reminds me a little of Highland Park (particularly once it is watered) but that's the problem as well. It is a finely crafted piece of work for sure but over here this costs just about the same as Highland Park 18 and I for one would not buy it in preference.

Tasted from a 30ml sampler.

""Good (almost Very Good)"" : 3.75 stars"
4.0,"My first Deanston. Very nice things i have heard of you. Are those things true? Lets find out.

I got to say that this one was one of those malts i have ignored for a long time because it just didn't made any clicks on my head. But recently whisky reviewers that i respect have been talking about this distillery like is the new Glendronach or something. So, i said to myself, if this is truly worth it, start medium big, so i went for the 18yo expression. The result was a very interesting and fine dram that IS NOT THE NEW GLENDRONACH.

Bottled at 46.3%abv. Burnished gold color.

On the nose: Vanilla very strong, Dry grass, Hay and Banana. A little simple here.

On the palate, it is very interesting. Straight spice bomb, not in the aftertaste but in the first touch with your tongue. American oak spice, Burnt hay. Super sweet an enjoyable. 

Aftertaste stays into that profile of hay/grass/spice. Very pleasant actually. Wasabi, chilli. 

Overall this dram feels dry and grassy. A very good dram that might fit some people, for me it was ok. 85 over 100."
