4.5,"What a surprising little fellow. Tormore has only two core expressions nowadays, the 14yo one and this great whisky, aged for 16 years. This is not only two years older than its predecessor, but also has a higher abv, 48%, which adds lot of flavor and character to it.

On the nose i got Almonds, Peaunts, Figs and ripe fruits. Tobacco.

On the palate, chocolate and sherried figs. Very very nice even if it is a little straightforward.

Aftertaste feels like eating a snickers chocolate bar. So nutty, so much vanilla sweetness. 

This is a great dram that i truly recommend. 90 over 100."
