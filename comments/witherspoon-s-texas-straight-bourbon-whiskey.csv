4.0,"I live close to the Witherspoon Distillery and visited the old distillery and have helped bottle spirts at the new Distillery that opened last year. While my favorite Witherspoon spirit is the Cross Timbers Single Malt I have also thoroughly enjoyed the Bourbon and the Single Barrel version of the Bourbon they sell (and I've hleped bottle). Witherspoons is a great local business that makes a damn good whiskey to boot in my opinion.  I always drink it with a small amount of ice and water, though the last single barrel I had was neat and I enjoyed the flavor and smoothness."

1.0,"The inter webs claim that this is 5-6 years old, but I would call foul with that. It is difficult to create a Bourbon of that age with such a flat flavor profile. It does have a slight hint of vanilla, and a tiny bit of smoke. Even with a huge cube melting it does not get better. In fact as mentioned it would be better neat.
The flavor profile seems very much like white corn which produces a much less complex flavor, very single track, and very simple at that.
Simple to the point that I had on search to make sure it was not a Spirit Whiskey.  The nose is pleasant but not complex either. I'll say one trick pony. It smells like it tastes with no real mystery. Not even like a librarian girl has a little wild side, it is just an overall flat, single lane experience that leaves me wondering if it is even 24 months old. I am sure they are not fibbing, cause the real Texas Bourbon Gods would strike down with furious vengeance those who attempt to destroy Bourbons Great Name.
All and all, I'd pass, I don't need to own a bottle."

2.0,"Appearance - deep copper/amber color. Brilliantly clear

Aroma - Green apple, bubble gum/cotton candy, light caramel, very very light oak notes with slight smoke and vanilla. Smells very sweet.

Taste: Candied green apple, slight smoky body with caramel and oak notes. High ethanol burn sneaks in at the end with a lingering aftertaste of oak and berries. Slight peanut brittle finish on the end.

Mouthfeel- Light-bodied upfront with medium legs

Finish: Very dry, astringent finish with notes of alcohol and oak.

Not my favorite bourbon, despite my preference towards higher ABV’s. Tastes too fruity and too young.

2 Stars - I️ wouldn’t buy an entire bottle/would be disappointed if I️ bought a dram in a bar, but certainly wouldn’t dump it."

4.0,"Maybe I was lucky but the bottle brought to my tasting I tried blind and o swear I would never had guessed it was a bourbon from Texas! I live here and will admit 99% of Texas bourbon sucks including Garrison brothers!
However this had a nice duffle banana nut read Nose , with slight oak and hints of vanilla that it immediately struck me off guard, however it was a single barrel and those can very . As I learned from many Henry McKenna 10yrs but the one I had was top notch 87/100"
3.0,good but strong 100proof

3.0,"I remember liking this. I was impressed that it came from Texas, then I received word that it might have actually been sourced bourbon. That kind of put a sour taste in my mouth.  I'm ok with sourcing, but don't lie to me."
4.0,"Maybe Texansince1847 got a bad batch, because mine is top shelf. It was one of the smoothest bourbons I've had. Will definitely purchase again, as it rivals some of the best I've sampled for a much better price."

4.0,This is a very good Bourbon for daily drinking.
4.0,"This is a good solid, drinkable bourbon from a local distiller. A bit pricey at $40."
5.0,"I'm going to give this 5 stars, though taste wise  it probably deserves 4.  The reason being is it's a Texas craft product that's  actually executed well.  I had a sample in downtown Austin and was impressed, when usually these types of products leave me feeling a bit disappointed.  Well done!!  Focus on quality, and I hope the money will follow y'all.  -good luck"

2.75,"I think it's Rye I don't care for much. A bit hot while neat, but I like how it finishes. Added a tsp of water and a couple ice cubes, didn't really mellow it much."

3.0,Ok.  A bit spicy and a slightly sharp finish.  Not a bad bourbon if you can get it under $30.

2.75,"On a large cube... Volatile nose w rye spice, alcohol, corn mash. Spicy, peppery, slight barrel char, creamed corn"
3.5,"It’s very peppery/hot. It needs ice, if your drinking it alone. I really like the Bourbon & Ginger cocktails with this. 

134 proof is hard to beat."

4.0,Barrel pic from Total Wine Richmond TX (Barrel #011). Nice caramel notes with a hint of tobacco and leather. Finishes strong with red fruit coming through and just a hint of salty. Nice sipping bourbon
4.0,"Been drinking this bourbon for over 6 years now and it never disappoints. It’s definitely got some heat with cinnamon, apple, and cotton candy on the nose. Definitely strong rye on the taste and a pretty smooth finish."
2.5,"Brassy and harsh, the taste is young and hot w/ dry cinnamon,  burnt toast, browned butter and a glimmer of sweet vanilla. This might be a mixer, but NOT a sipper. Benefits from a lot of time in the glass."
2.75,This would be good for a mixer.
