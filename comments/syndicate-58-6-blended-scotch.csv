4.0,"I received this as part of a Master of Malt Drinks by the Dram gift set at Christmas. Because it wasn't listed on Distiller at the time, I didn't write a review and I don't have my tasting notes. So, unfortunately, I cannot recall any specifics, except that my impression was very favorable. If I find a bottle down the road, I will re-review and re-rate."
