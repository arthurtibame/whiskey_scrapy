4.5,"Although I originally tasted this four months ago with @PBMichiganWolverine, as he mentions in his review, I’ve been waiting to revisit the additional sample I kept from his bottle before posting a review. It did not disappoint. In addition to the beautiful balance of sweet and savory flavors, I loved the oily, mouth-coating texture of this whisky. Smogen, I’m smitten."
4.5,"@Richard-ModernDrinking and I had a tasting last night where we shared a few drams with each other.   This was one of mine that I bought for the tasting.   If the Macallan 10 from the 80s was the belle of the ball, this was the unexpected beautiful princess that showed up.  I ranked this 4 out of the 12 for the night, only superseded by the 80s Macallan, Ardbeg Drum CE, and Stranger & Stranger.  It’s a triple distilled Swedish, highly peated, matured fully in French Sauternes cask.  Peaty, with a meaty backbone.  Heather and sweetness.  Really well balanced with smoke and sweetness.  Totally unexpected."
