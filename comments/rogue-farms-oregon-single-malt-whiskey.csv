null,Did not have this one – had their Rye. Did not like it – tasted like tequila.
1.0,"Tastes like salt water.
I was at a whisky tasting and talked to the vendor representing them and he agreed some of the early vintages were horrid.

Honestly I don't think it's worth a redemptive try."

3.5,I’m impressed with the flavor profile they were able to obtain in such a short amount of time. It’s a good entry into the world of single malt.  It’s smooth and sweet with a nice finish that slowly fades away.

3.0,"I'm guessing this is the same as Chatoe Rogue from Oregon but I can't find a listing for it. Anyway, I'll rate it here. Sourmash nose. Sweet, very sweet even for a rye. Tastes a little underrefined. Still, it does its job."
