3.5,"Ah I can't really help myself with this bar. I can't just wander by...just..have...to...have...one...just one small dram. Ok 3 drams..definitely just 3. No. 1 Glen turret. I have this paired with the 26 year Glenturret from BBR and a 24 year Jura...so how does it fare? Well very well actually even though it's the cheaper dram at ~ $55 USD. Nice viscous mouth feel, the bourban is dominant. Now if the KM 09 is a 4 this can't be more than a 3.4."
