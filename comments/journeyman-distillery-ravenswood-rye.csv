4.0,"Tastes substantially less harmful to my DNA than the non-organic version. Chem-trails. Elvis and Amelia Earnhart faked the moon landing in D'Jibouti. 

I have friends who don't really like rye whiskeys, but I think they'll like this one. Has a maple syrupy feel and smell. I'm honestly struggling to get beyond that flavor as well. A hint of lemon on the finish. Good rye matey!"

2.0,"Copper in color. Sweet, maple, woody aroma. There is a slight oiliness, but also sweet, banana taste, with hints of something unpleasant (like I’m swishing a shoe in my mouth...not leather... shoe). It is dry, and simple, little to no burn, and little spice. Overall, this is an easy sipper, but leaves me needing more flavor."

3.0,"Nose- It has that baking spice fragrance that suggests rye but that is tempered by sweet brown sugar.
Body- This dram is very smooth for a rye. This may be due to the high wheat content. Baking spices give way to pie crust and oats. 
Finish- Fairly short but very pleasant. There is a suggestion of a sweet chocolate and fruit candy like the Cadbury fruit and nut bars. 

Note- This whiskey is fairly one noted and may lack some depth due to its younger age (a guess). However, the note is remarkably nice. This is one of the most enjoyable ryes I have had and is the best craft whiskey I have had the privilege of drinking up to this point. Seriously! Given as a gift in Clyde not Clyde, Asheville not Asheville, NC. Thanks John! Prost!"

***tasted the regular (not cask strength), still good, but not as good. Probably 3.25."

4.0,"Gotta tell ya, you all must have reviewed an older version of this.  I just bought a bottle and I have no “young” flavors, no overwhelming hotness nor alcohol.  I am getting a mouthful of baking spice and vanilla.  A lingering finish that inevitably says, “have another sip, please “"

2.75,"Nothing has smelled more like a freshly mowed, recently rained yard than this whiskey. It even goes a bit deeper to resemble wet earth, but I dig it, pun intended, as always. The initial taste is not as powerful as I had thought it would be (although I don't know why I had thought that), but the rye flavor is very obvious and up front. The ever so popular sweetness does develop over time, but it does take a while and certainly doesn't have a ""bourbon feeling"" to it. It is a little bit underwhelming, and would benefit from more age, as most ryes would."
3.75,"Really stiff and spicy, which mainly means I don't want it too often, but real tasty"

4.25,"Oh man! I’ve been holding on to this bottle for a few months while I drink other things. Well, that was a big mistake!

First “neck” pour was all banana nut bread. The second pour was a vanilla bomb with very little spice that you might expect from a 60% rye. 

If you find this on the shelf, buy it!"
3.5,"Wow, very fruity (like bubblegum or tutti frutti) and very easy to drink. I'm not sure if this is great example of the style but it is nice to drink."

2.25,"Taste:  Neat 2.0 oz pour in bourbon snifter.

Nose (1.5) Seeded rye bread dunked in turpentine.  Not a huge fan.  A little bit of chocolate and butterscotch.

Taste (2.5) Rye seeds, heathbar but that solvent base wrecked it for me.  Best way to describe is if someone took a Heathbar and dipped it in gasoline. You want the heathbar but not the gasoline!

Finish (2.5):  More chocolate, very solvent like with some dill pickle at the end.  Best thing is that it was short.

Overall: Glad I took the pour for 7.50 instead of investing in a bottle.  Was not a fan"
