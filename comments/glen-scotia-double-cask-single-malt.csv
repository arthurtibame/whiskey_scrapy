2.0,"Spice wasn't particularly present, but not completely absent. Could almost pass for a bourbon due to sweetness, if not for the after taste that is distinctly scotch."
3.0,"Bourbon like, spicy, sweet.... Sherry. Decent burn on the back end."
4.0,"I quite enjoyed this. The sweet, Pedro Ximenez qualities are very evident on the nose - the first thing that pops up is dark dried fruit and nuts, followed by salty air, caramel (salted caramel!), orange peel, butterscotch, pipe tobacco, hay, and green apple - it's a dry malt. On the palate. the sweetness hits early and hard as the fruit moves back into salted caramel and candied orange peel, with a dry, slightly sweet smoky ending."

4.0,"N: Pine needles right off the bat oddly enough then an almost creamy butterscotch and bees was. Really quite a unique combination.
    P: Caramel, butterscotch, toffee...it is hard to pin down in this GS. Then that salty coastal note. The PX influence is there too with a rich sweetness that transitions into the finish. 
    F: somewhat dry with a bit of spice. Long and lingering."
3.0,"Surprisingly found for sale already in Pennsylvania. Perhaps there is (a small) advantage to state-run liquor monopolies...

First impressions: Dark honey-gold color, with haze from the scotch mist increasing the honey impression. However, I seriously doubt this is it's natural color (at least it's non-chill filtered).

Nose: Initially powerful cocoa, leading spicy oak and trailing dark cherry. This combination unmistakably conjures boozy chocolate-covered cherries! Underneath lurk (not entirely welcome) hints of agave nectar and tequila (tell-tale young spirit).

Palate: Syrupy mouthfeel, sweet and spicy, but fairly hot... Sharp orange zest appears while bourbon-like vanilla gathers on the tongue.

Finish is relatively quick, and quite drying. It may just be my fervid idealist opinion, but I'd be more forgiving of this dram's shortcomings had it been natural color with an age statement (even just 3 years!), but it's fetching enough to hold the attention.

Dry glass: chocolate syrup."

2.5,"Scotland, September 2017. Whisky #15.

Nose: Initially floral and pine resin. Later woody vanilla, caramel and brine.

Palate: Dry spicy arrival, then developing woody, sherry and raisin notes. Toasted grain and brown bread.

Finish: Long and quite dry. Brine and bitter orange at the conclusion, with a little dark chocolate.

Water softens the nose, the sharp pine resin aroma changing to a dusky oak note. A little sweetness comes out in the palate which is nice, but it also introduces some sourness into the finish and it remains very dry in overall character.

It's an OK whisky, but my least favourite of their expressions - it’s just not up there with the very nice 15 year old or the lovely Victoriana and isn't great value at the price.

“Average” : 2.5 stars"

4.0,"Found this note recently left over from our trip to western Scotland last September. Only took notes of whiskies that left an impression, and apparently this one did.  This 46% NAS double cask is aged in first-fill bourbon before spending its final year PX sherry casks. I do remember the night I drank this, but the memory is faint other than the following:

Unique and elegant complex nose (spicy bourbon & fruity sherry)
Dry, peppery palate w/ vanilla, fruits, & nuts. Allspice
Smooth & dry fruity finish

2.0,"Falling back to daily routine, a Friday evening finds me back to tasting this sample provided by @PBMichiganWolverine. Let’s give it a go. 

A sweet and fruity nose of vanilla, Creme brûlée and green apples. A slight brininess floats above. The nose takes time to open.  The sticky sweetness becomes and darker fruits notes come more forward. The nose is quite delightful. 

A thin body brings a bourbon-esque vanilla sweetness arrives, but it quickly fades as the glimpse of sweetness turns to a strong cracked pepper spiciness.  A woodiness quality comes through as it the palate draws towards the finish along with some orange zest.  

The finish is spicy and bitter. Drying, that finally leaves a Burnt toast flavor. 

An inviting, robust, promising nose gives way to a flat and uninspiring palate which fails to deliver that promise.  [82/100][Tasted: 1/18/19]"

From the get go there was a strong ethanol smell that continued right in to the palate and continued through the finish. This is a very spicy scotch especially since it is on;y 46%. I appreciate that this is finish in Pedro Ximenez casks for a short time."

3.75,"N: In spite of the abundant fruit aromas, there is a spiky salty backbone to this nose, like capers or oysters.

P: initial entry is sweet with cherries and fruitcake, but lemon peel, seaweed, and mineral water cut through those richer notes. Then there are a few hints of dark chocolate and cinnamon.

F: a little salty, a little sweet... complex. Like Kilkerran, I find this Campbeltown malt to be really intriguing and not easily classified."

First taste lets the Sherry Cask exploits all it's flavors. Later tastes are from the American oak so it is a very good balanced mix. Peppered finish. Adding water the smell dissapers a bit and new notes of lavanda. At the palate it's roughly the same but a bit more oily and slightly less peppered. Definitely one of my favorite whisky so far"

4.0,"Stop number 50 on the SDT is Glen Scotia. One of only three distilleries in the Campbeltown region of Scotland. Double Cask is a NAS whisky matured in ex bourbon casks and then finished for about 12 months in PX sherry casks. This is bottled at 46% ABV, is non chill filtered and natural color of golden honey. 

The nose is rich and full. Some alcohol burn at first but that quickly fades into quite the little sherry bomb. Dark toffee, caramel and honey. Dark dried sherry fruits, raisins, dates and figs. Brown sugar/molasses. Black cherry pie filling, plums and maple syrup. Sweet but not cloyingly so. A very deep and roasted type feel to it. Roasted almonds, chocolate, vanilla cream and buttery biscuits. Perfumed oak and faint mint. Quite nice indeed. 

The palate arrives spicy and sweet, but more on the sweet side. A dark and deep sweetness. Toffee, vanilla, syrup. Sherried fruits, dark berries, raisins, dates. A little pepper and nearly burnt pie crust. It’s a tad young feeling but still very good. 

Medium to full bodied. A little on the dry side but also mouthwatering at times. 
A medium long finish full of sherry, cherry syrup and toasted oak. 

Although it comes off as young overall (8-10 years), it has depth and maturity in there as well. A good sherry bomb that has a pretty good value at $50. It could have been smoother on the palate with less bite and had a stronger finish, but I still enjoyed it quite well. Thanks to @PBMichiganWolverine for the sample. A solid 4. 
Cheers"

3.0,"I decided to kick off our 4th round of samples after stuffing my face with turkey all day.  Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!  This NAS whisky from the Campbeltown region of Scotland was provided by my friend Pranay.  It comes in at a robust 46% ABV and is a blend of ex- first fill bourbon casks and Pedro Ximenez sherry casks.  It’s a rich, golden amber in the taster and looks plenty oily when you spin it.

The nose was initially heavy on the fresh oak barrel with some green apple mingling with salty, seaside air.  After resting for 15-20 minutes the PX sherry cask started to make its presence known.

On the tongue, there were sugary toffee notes that were quickly subdued by a strong hit of apple brandy heat and harshness.  The youth of the whisky really shows up and turns the dram into a bit of a chore to finish.  It isn’t offensive, just strong.  

The finish is abrasive:  heat and spicy oak battle for attention with sweet sherry showing up well after the sip- if you can handle just sitting there waiting for everything to cool down.  This whole experience would be fine if you knew what to expect going in.  Otherwise it’s a bit shocking.

This whisky was originally a non-US release but a quick search on wine searcher found it readily available now across the US for $55-60.  That’s asking a bit much for an abrasive, NAS juice IMO.  It’s middle of the road for me in just about every aspect.  Thanks again Pranay for offering this one up for the group.  3.25 stars.  Cheers."
3.0,"This one is extremely similar to the Auchentoshan Three Wood to me. A ton of molasses, caramel, sherry notes, dark brown sugar, and some other dark spices on the nose. The palate is tasty with the same notes, plus some nice burn from the 46% ABV. The finish is medium length, and carries in a vanilla/espresso flavor. You do have to be in the mood for a sweet dram, but I might have to disagree with Pranay on this one a little bit. Thanks so much for the sample, my friend. It's too bad it's not normally available in the U.S. A nice 3.5 from me. A theme to this dram should be a sweet song like ""There She Goes"" by The Las."
2.0,"This is my contribution as we start our round 4 in our little trading team.  While pouring out samples for the team last night, iI took a wee bit for myself as well.  Nose:  woody vanilla.  Take some oak, mix in that vanilla powder from Starbucks...and voila!  You get this.  Taste:  resin, sweet caramel.  I'm a huge fan of Cambeltown, but this falls a bit short compared to its cross town cousins over in Springbank.  Then again, honestly---it's a fraction of the Springbank price.  What do you expect for $40-50?  It's not earth shattering, but really not too bad as well considering the price.  Cambeltown for the budget-minded."

2.5,"This one is actually closer to bottle kill levels than I though, guess it goes on the kill table after the review. Anyway a lot of people have been discussing this one lately and I though I'd go back and review.

Nose - So I always get a bit of pepper on this but it's awfully sweet behind that. I get some christmas spice, baking spices, and cookies and vanilla and it's a kid's christmas party really. There's certainly some oak here but it really only gives you oak notes when you're thinking whisky and oak. As this opens the PX really starts to come out, it's that super sticky sweet sherry note, not the drier Oloroso notes. I get even a crayon element here as well now that it's opened up.

Taste - The flavor is a lot less of that christmas note. I still get some pepper but the real showcase is ginger bread cookies, there's a hint of that sherry giving this perhaps more of those christmas notes, but really vanilla is the overwhelming element on the flavor profile. Yeah as I get acclimated to the flavors it's vanilla and then for sure PX sherry casks  with as I keep saying all kinds of spices all over. 

This is not what I think of with Glen Scotia or Campbeltown at all. It's unique and very interesting. I must say between this and the victoriana Glen Scotia does some of the most interesting things with oak influence. I'm not sure how they're getting these notes. Maybe it's european oak on the PX casks? Are they storing these barrels somewhere....like in the ocean? Now I'm getting some kind of funk at the end that's starting to give me campbeltown notes, where was that the last 10 minutes? 

This is a darn good whisky and if I recall it's pretty cheap. 

Anyway with an NAS I tend to not let these sit in the glass too long before jumping in. I was wrong with this one. Give this a good 10-15 minutes to open up. The sherry comes through however with some time i start get some younger oak notes. 

I went from a 2.0 to a 3.0 and back to a 2.0. This is a 4.0 in terms of uniqueness and on that note maybe I should score it higher. It however is younger whisky and I can't see myself doing more than 2 pours at a time. That said this is one I can keep going back to. So I'm back to a 2.5."

3.25,"This is my first Campbeltown , so I'm not sure if this is indicative of the region or not. 

The nose is sawdust, cherrywood/sherry (it used Pedro Jimenez sherry casks), and a hell of a lot of smoky booze. It may benefit to let this one air out a bit due to every digit of that 46% entering the nasal cavity. With a drop of water, a lot of rich maple emerges.

The taste is a really prickly combination of orange rind, oak, finished sandalwood, and spicy white pepper. The orange zest and that sweet, syrupy maple stuff. 

With a droplet to open it up, more floral notes bloom. The maple amps up in the taste the more water that is added.

The finish is first the cherry/sherry cask remants. That later morphs into oak and char from them barrels. There is a burn and a dry charcoal ash in the finish."

Bottled at 46%.

On the nose: dude, this is not whisky, this is the actual wedding cake. No othe whisky has deliver this note like this one. I can even taste the cake by nosing this dram. Superb sherry from the Px casks.

On the palate, sherry, oaky and cake note delivered in such a wonderful way. Simply outstanding. Finish was medium long, spicy but pleasant. Here is where it lost the 2 points. Very balanced and well made, i give this baby a 98 over 100 and was the highlight of my night. (Among 3 other whiskies lol)"

The palate turns to more muscular notes, albeit in the spectrum of sweetness, with alcohol that warms the spirits and introduces a hint of cinnamon and dried apricot, with candied orange, caramel and a smear of salted butter, together with a biscuit base woodiness. Intense and determined.
The finish is long, of wood, salted butter and cinnamon."
