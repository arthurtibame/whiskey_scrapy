5.0,"""First impression on the nose is light smokiness with a salty background (salty caramel), but it develops further revealing cooked fruit (apple) and citric notes. The taste is really sweet (syrup), and the smokiness is still there but softer. While tasting it, there is a different sensation on the mouthwatering. The finish is amazing, long and complex revealing some many different tastes one after another, with chocolate being the most appreciated one."""

4.0,"The Bowmore core line features a wide range of flavor profiles due to different finishing techniques, rather than merely relying on age to alter the nature of their scotches.  Islay single malts invariably mellow out as they age, and this Bowmore is no exception.  But, in addition to that effect from aging, the 15- and 18-year drams both feature longer sherry-cask aging.  The unsherried 12-year old dram leans heavily on minerality and coppery notes, with minimal sweetness.  The 18's combination of higher age and sherry finishing mellows out the peat smoke considerably.  This may be the fruitiest Islay scotch I've tasted, with a nose full of berries and zesty melon.  There is smoke, of course, but it's a distant or peripheral effect rather than front and center.  The palate and finish continue playing with fruit flavors, including berries and perhaps even passion fruit or other tropical fruits at times, with the smoke giving the sensation of a Hawaiian barbecue.  I'm missing some of the intensity I like from Islay scotches here.  For those who like a gentler, fruitier scotch, but with a substantial smoke backbone, Bowmore 18 may be an ideal scotch for them.  At $100-125, it's priced in the same range as most other 18-year old Islay scotches."
null,"Not peaty, not smoky a bit salty"
3.0,"It is as advertised (by Bowmore themselves as well as Stephanie's review). Dark as night fruit and honey sweetness, chocolate, and Bowmore's characteristic peat smoke. Dark, sweet and salty. It’s smoother than the 15 year but it’s still a little unrefined. A little dark/heavy for my taste. $127 in Ontario."

Was one of the favourites at the tasting I ran last night.  Early 4's I give it. Update. The bottles been open a while now with not much remaining. Rating still holds but I'm getting flavours of bacon and a slight hint of the cat pee flavour that was quite prevalent in the 15."

Lacks the oily finish that lets some Svotches leave a great lasting flavor for hours.  Decent Scotch, but inferior to the more affordable Bowmore 15, and much inferior to the better ballanced and broader palette of the Ardbeg 10 year."

4.0,"Finally a Bowmore I really like. The nose is sweet peat, vanilla, sea salt, some leather and a twist of lemon in the background. I just realized the nose is like if someone opened a Lagavulin 16 nearby. It is much more subdued than Lagavulin but most of the same notes are there. I just keep picking up the glass and smelling this whisky.
    
    The palate is again sweet peat, hay, a nice oak flavor, salt and at the end a hint of white pepper. It has a nice oily feel and is definitely not watery.
    
    The finish is medium long with hints of vanilla swirling around the peat.
    
    This is a good whisky and I'd give it a 3.8/5, rounded to 4. The problem is it seems like a Lagavulin 16 wannabe, and if I want Lagavulin, then I'll drink Lagavulin, the Lagavulin 16 is better and cheaper."

The smoke, such as it is, is quite subtle and muted. There's a huge and subtly sweet malted background here that almost defies description. Very intoxicating,  even on the nose."

5.0,"#WhiskyBattle between highly complex, full-bodied, light to medium-peated 18 year-old scotch whiskies - both at 43% ABV. #Bowmore18 vs. #HighlandPark18. Reviewed on 7/1/2018.
....…......….…...........................................................................
1) NOSE:
a) Bowmore 18: campfire wood, apple pie, stewed citrus. Great nose. 91/100
b) Highland Park 18: salted caramel, pineapple, dark chocolate, fresh apples, and sea smoke. Very complex. 94/100
....…......….…...........................................................................
2) PALATE:
a) Bowmore 18: dark chocolate, sweet BBQ, and creamy caramel. It turns soft and mellow as it runs in your mouth. 92/100
b) Highland Park 18: sweet and tart citrus, toffee, espresso, dark chocolate, and gentle sweet smoke. Like Bowmore 18, a sip of Highland Park 18 becomes mellow as it dances in your mouth, but it’s even more mouthwatering and pleasant than its rival. 96/100
....…......….…...........................................................................
3) FINISH: Both drams offer a long and complex finish, but Highland Park 18 offers so much more...sweet sherry and light smoke dance around your tongue long after it’s over. Bowmore 18 gets a 90 and HP 18 gets a 96.
....…......….…...........................................................................
4) OVERALL EXPERIENCE: Bowmore 18 is a nice blend of sherry and peat...it gets a 91. Highland Park 18 is so much more and unlike anything in its price range; it’s a near-perfect whisky and gets a 95/100.
....…......….…...........................................................................
5) VFM: Both #Bowmore 18 and #HighlandPark 18 are solid values at $120, but I recommend #HighlandPark18 more because it’s the best whisky you can taste at that price. #HP18 has #naturalcolor, but both are chill-filtered. If HP18 had a higher ABV (46% or higher) and non-chill filtered, I think it can earn a score of 97 or higher.

Bowmore Vertical 3 of 7
There are whiskies that are useless, like that 18-year-old. Yes, it spent 3 more years in barrels than its little brother, but for $30 more a bottle, I'll settle for the 15-year-old. Don't think I don't appreciate this whisky, quite the contrary, I preferred it to the other, but so little that I don't think I'm investing this amount in this product"
4.25,"Interesting to taste this again after five years, when I was first navigating whisky with the help of some Master of Malt samples. And interesting also in the context of my recent tasting of their younger bottlings, which I found too sweet to even finish. Bowmore is like an obnoxious child that suddenly becomes an agreeable adult at 18. The sweet and smokey elements are in harmony, and the oily texture sticks to the roof of your mouth. The peat is pleasantly sharp and lingering on the aftertaste."

Remarkably smooth on the palate for an Islay in my opinion. It’s full and rich and the finish is long. Surprisingly, though, the smoke isn’t what lingers, and I like that. A line of iodine runs through the dram. The flavor is savory and reminds me of delicious smoked meats. Had a steak beforehand, and it played off of that so so well. Not usually what I go for in a whisky, but I’m enjoying this a bunch. Very complex. Could be a gateway Islay distillery for me."

4.5,"Bowmore is one of the more overlooked Islay distilleries. I've seen some very mixed reviews for its core lineup around here. I happen to be a fan of the 12 year, so seeing the 18-year drop from $115 to $90 at my local liquor store, this purchase was a no-brainer.

Nose: Sherry cask-aging is evident. I get dried red fruit, cranberry (craisins perhaps), and the sort of baking spices you'd smell around Christmas. Orange peel and honeydew. Big on the honey, and relatively light on the smoke and peat. Some sea salt and brine, but again, it's less pronounced than in your average Islay. Oaky bitterness which is likely a symptom of age.

Palate: Sweet honey, vanilla, butterscotch, and toffee. Very jammy and there's a bit of caramel. Savory dark chocolate. A bit of smoke then reveals itself, followed by a more substantial wave of briny notes; sea salt and seaweed. Getting some orange and plum for the sherry influence coupled with some more unique notes like honeydew and cantaloupe. Amazing and easily the stand-out portion of the overall experience.

Finish: More of that dark chocolate and some salted caramel and toffee, culminating in some cinnamon and black pepper notes. The oak one would expect from an 18-year old malt is most prevalent here. Short-to-medium in length.

Solid combination of Islay-peated malt aged in the standard bourbon-sherry cask combination. The words rich and balanced come to mind. And talk about a kick-ass value. This was certainly worth its salt at $90.

For now I'll drop it at 4.5. This is one of the few 18-year old single malts I've ever seen for under $100. It performs on par with bottles over double its price, so if you're a peat-head looking for a change of pace, grab this one. Damn fine effort from Bowmore right here."

4.0,"Bowmore tasting evening at The Oak Barrel, Sydney, June 26th 2019: Whisky #4

Nose: Ginger syrup with a touch of sherry, a thin spread of orange marmalade over caramel sauce and warm but restrained floral tones (jasmine? violet?). The otherwise sweet nose is enlivened and balanced by a supple and well-defined peat-reek that is broad, mellow and expresses complexity, and by a delicate seaweed note and an olive-brine aroma.

Palate: A sweet citrus, sherry and spicy arrival. The development brings forceful but fragrant smoke not unlike aromatic pipe-tobacco but the sherry notes are never far away. There's a sweetly floral, stewed fruit quality and some leathery richness that brings complexity to the palate. It's very complete and the signature Bowmore  saltiness is also present. The texture is excellently rounded and lightly oily with dark chocolate and walnuts towards the finale.

Finish: Medium/long. The flavours majestically saunter off into peaty, dark chocolate sweetness with a touch of orange zest.

I've tasted the 18 year old previously and not taken proper notes, but I think this current expression is a notch above previous batches. This whisky is where Bowmore suddenly seems to come of age, and it confirms my long-held conclusion that old Bowmore is good Bowmore, and young Bowmore should be avoided.

It's a conspicuously more complete and satisfying whisky than anything younger in their range, with the notable exception of some of the bourbon-matured cask-strength expressions, like Tempest. A  lot of what is good here is down to excellent sherry-matured components and overall it's a delightfully elegant whisky with layers of complexity to explore.

Water brings out a little more spice and expands the smoke on the finish, but otherwise does not change much about the profile. I'd recommend taking it neat. One word of caution - this is a slow whisky and it needs a lot of rest in the glass before it starts to reveal its charms.

I’m giving it 4 stars, but it just barely makes it across the line and at the price it is not a recommended buy - for the same money or less there are some true 5 star whiskies out there.

“Very Good"" : 4 stars."

4.0,"Peat. So much peat, honey and maple syrup on the nose. Charcoal, well balanced with an early sweetness. A little harsher than expected but still works. Clearly I need a more refined palate to properly appreciate this scotch. Tastes a little more alcoholic than expected. Lovely to try but there are other bottles I'd buy over this one."

4.5,"Deep and dark, smooth and bold. It embodies everything about Islay, only it’s MORE. Heavy smoke obviously. Sophisticated like an old money aristocrat who knows his public gaffes are endearing."
5.0,"This got me into Islay drams. If this didn’t exist I probably wouldn’t have started enjoying peaty whiskies. Damp wood on the initial nose like a cabin just soaked up misty rain in a forest. Not kidding. Sherry appears  in the distance with mellow smoke. The fruitiness is also there, maybe some orange and honey as well. A favorite of mine. 99/100"

4.0,"Beautiful dark amber color with a reddish hue. Almost mahogany in the bottle. Very pleasant to drink, very complex flavors. 

Mostly oak on the nose, get a little bit of the sherry sweetness. On the palate there is enough smoke and sweet peat to know it’s from Islay, but it isn’t overpowering. Very well-balanced, even flavor between the sherry and bourbon oak influences. Some honey at the start followed by rich raisin, jam, and fruity flavors. A touch of seaweed and salt as well. 

Water brings out the sherry at first but dilutes a bit and adds a bit of sourness. Don’t recommend water. 

Very nice and complex, would buy again."

4.5,"Strong fruity, orange scents on the nose. More mellow than the twelve, so some of the flavours are more prominent. Creamy mouthfeel."
4.25,"Everyone who reads my reviews know that Bowmore didn't made it for me in my past two experiences (12yo and 15 yo darkest), but this beauty is totally different, changing my whole opinion of the brand. Older is better for Bowmore.

Bottled at 43%abv, with a beautiful Burnt Umber color. 

This Islay is the most ""Islay"" of the 3 bowmore i have tasted, On the nose its so perfect and complex that you are preparing for a ten, but sadly the palate doesn't meet the Nose, eventhough is not bad at all.

I have to say that im impressed with the long legs this drops on the glencairn, the longest i've ever seen so far. 

On The nose: the most perfect perfumed peat there is. Under it you will find complex aromas as toffee, vanilla, prune peel, ashes, citrus fruits and caramel, all changing, all there, but showing themselves in an artistic way.

On the palate is HOT. Medium-full thick bodied, with notes of red chilli peppers, oak, spices, dark chocolate and some oil that resembles sunblocking oil or gasoline of some kind. This is a macho dram, but pleasant and mouth watering at the same time. Dark Chocolate is also present.

The finish is also medium-long with spices and ashes, some earthy flavor as well.

This beauty is the bowmore you should try, forget those silly 12 and 15 yo bottles, go for the big leagues with this one. 86 out of 100."
4.75,Smells of mahogany honey and carmel.Very smooth with a mahogany Carmel and honey flavor. Nice after taste of cinnamon spice with a light peaty smoky flavor that stays in the palette. Very complex.
4.0,Sublime
4.5,"Absolutely wonderful, tasting notes are spot on. If you take your time with this one you'll find much, much more hidden in the smoke. A little expensive but worth it."
4.75,"A superb expression of the Bowmore Vaults.
Less rich or fruity than the 15yo but far more rounded and polished flavours. Unexpensive for a 18yo single malt. Wonderful dram to pair with chocolates.
Not as oaky as expected but with a surprising long long and complex finish , with hints of delicious smoke and spices."

Taste - Rich, Smooth, buttery mouthfeel. Smoky, yet sweet with the same notes I get on the nose.

4.75,"Reacquainting myself with one of my first loves and it still holds up after all these years.
The smoke is there upfront (the first pour from the newly opened bottle made me think of diesel), but when you let it sit for a while in the glass the sherry starts showing up.
I almost get raisins on this mixed with dark fruits and the taste lingers quite long, goes a bit dry at the end which only entices you to take another sip!
Might order a second bottle right now, yum!"
4.25,"Peat smoke and medicinal (Band-Aid) aromas in the nose. Rich, complex smoke flavor, a bit sweet and reminiscent of beef jerky, on the palette. Medicinal flavor appears in the finish, followed by smoke that lingers for a long time. 3 cl sample from the 12 Drams of Christmas Premium (2019 Edition)."
