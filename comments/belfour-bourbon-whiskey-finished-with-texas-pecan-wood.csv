4.5,"The majestic beauty of a 300-year-old, oversized pecan tree on the old Belfour ranch in North Texas inspired this unique spirit. This Bourbon Whiskey aged in American white oak barrels then spent extra time mellowing with added staves of Texas pecan wood, imparting subtle notes of brown sugar and heavy notes of smoky roasted pecan.

Appearance: Golden honey, light amber

Nose: Nutty, butterscotch, crème brulee

Taste: Smoky vanilla, molasses

Finish: Long mellow warmth with a rich mouthfeel layered with vanilla"
