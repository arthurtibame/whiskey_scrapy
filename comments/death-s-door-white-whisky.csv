It tried ever so hard to punch me in the teeth but, luckily, I had protection from a decent sweet vermouth and an absurd number of cherries.  It was floral, otherwise, and dainty to smell.  But in no way was it that nice otherwise.  It'll sucker punch you.  And some days, that's exactly what you need."
