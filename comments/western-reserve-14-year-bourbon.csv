3.5,For the price and a 14 year bourbon not worth it.   Tastes like a less aged bourbon

3.0,High priced mediocrity in a glass.  No distiller statement when purchased.  Sourced from KY and Indiana...tastes like Dickel...buyers remorse.

2.0,"So people keep asking about these, I figured I'd put my notes together.  

So completely terrible disclosure, just that it was bottled in Ohio.  I'm betting this is Tennessee Dickle juice.  

Nose - Nice bright sweetness, fruity notes, dusty corn, caramel and vanilla.  It's pretty standard bourbon notes with a bit more depth thanks to the age.  

Taste- Dusty corn, slightly sour, a bit of funk, vanilla, and caramel.  Light body.  So much dusty corn.  If you like the dusty corn and sweetness, you'll enjoy.  This however is a 115 dollar bottle of bourbon.  That's not what I want at that price.

This is a firm pass at these prices.  I'd pay 40-50 and buy it again."
4.0,"Barrel #1, bottle 140. $20 Poor. Faint hint of vanilla on the nose. Spicy up front with a long pepper finish. Smooth and big charcoal finish. Way to go Ohio!"
3.75,Smooth but lacks body.
2.5,"Not a fan, harsh for a 14 year"
4.5,Easy drinking
0.25,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
