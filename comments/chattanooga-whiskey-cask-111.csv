4.5,"Fantastic whiskey produced by this distillery...Already have a back up bottle on hand. Nose is intense with sweet spices, charred barrel, leather and tobacco. On the palate, much of the same as on the nose but with a smooth, mouth coating, long finish. Ridiculously smooth for cask strength and truly a spirit to be savored. Cheers!"

2.25,"It's taken a few rounds to identify the flavor,  and I definitely pick up the anise notes, which is not one of my favorites.  Subtle,  but now that I found it I can't shake it. Otherwise it's okay,  and some folks will really like it - just not me."

null,"No... just no. I bought this bottle with high hopes and it let me down, WAY down. Imagine buying a bottle of Jack Daniels, opening and letting it sit out in the sun for a few months - that’s what I’m picking up here. It’s a funky, stale, metallic, version of jack (which I enjoy); not interesting, and not even palatable. It’s like jack Daniels mixed with pepto bismol and fermented prune juice. I poured this out after a few sips. 👎🏼 (refund please!)"

4.0,Sweet and creamy. With hints of candies and Carmel. A bit of a. Run but balanced by the sweetness of this bourbon. This will be one you love or hate and I love it.

1.0,I’m not a fan. Very similar to Willett.
4.25,"Nose- baking shortening/ buttery/ like mom's cookie sheet after it's been greased/vanilla
Taste- honey/ apricots/ milky creme carmel 
Finish - baking spice/allspice"

4.25,"Bold, hint of carmel, and wonderful mash bill"
4.25,"Sweet start, obvious caramel flavor that waxes and wanes. For 111 proof goes down incredibly smooth to the point I feel like it is 80 proof. When adding water/ice the flavor it is diluted too much and loses it’s caramel roller coaster.  Would be a great bourbon for those who love sweet or educating non-whiskey drinkers about picking up a note of something they have already experienced without having a well developed whiskey pallet."
3.75,"Nose has honey,malt, brown sugar and  vanilla.

The palate is oily and sweet with malt, fairly spicey in a good way, and some grassy-ness.

Finish is medium length with vanilla and some residual spiciness on the tongue and cheeks. 

I enjoyed this one, but was somewhat surprised by this one. Very different from their sources 1816 line that is now discontinued. Given that this one has a high malt content, it has more of a Scotchyness to it. But still has some nice barrel spices that you might find from a higher proof bourbon."
4.0,Love the malt
