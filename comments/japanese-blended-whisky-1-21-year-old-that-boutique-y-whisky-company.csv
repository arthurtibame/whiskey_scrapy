3.5,"There is always the assumption in the back of my mind that unless it's an actual Japanese distillery official release and it's an age that's less than the distillery has been open i.e. most likely not sourced, then it's a good chance it isn't Japanese.

Now TBWC not being a Japanese label should mean by declaring it's a 'Japanese' it actually is and all the internet chatter believes it to be true so it most likely is. One person thought Yamazakura, another translated the Japanese inscription which included reference to Bamboo and the only distillery with that referenced in the name is Taketsuru.. so they deduce it's that or Nikka. They also amazingly had a bottle of the 21 which as of this month has been announced will be discontinued and drank side by side (must have a damn deep collection!) and believed it to be similar. The Taketsuru range is a blend of blend of malt whiskies produced at Nikka's Yoichi and Miyagikyo distilleries. So that makes sense although why they would serve up stock to TBWC if they are running low doesn't..although if they were thinking of discontinuing then maybe it does..I think I'm going to much down a rabbit hole which may even be the wrong one!

It's not a bad drop. Creme brulee, vanilla, banana, slightly bitter wood. The finish is short ethanolly. Definitely not worth the price of a couple few hundred usd though."
