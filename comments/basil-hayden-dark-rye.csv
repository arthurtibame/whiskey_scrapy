2.0,"I am not a fan of this one. Love the packaging and love seeing it beside BH, and BH Rye though. Dark cherry on the nose. A chalky cocoa and fruit taste. And a lingering old chocolate covered cherry on the finish. That ""touch"" of port is a touch too much in my opinion."

3.0,"A real odd-ball--Basil Hayden's Dark Rye builds on the success of Aberta Premium Dark Horse (rebranded as Alberta Rye Dark Batch in the US) by flipping the formula. Where the original was mostly Canadian rye with a dollop of high rye bourbon and a splash of sherry, this fellow leads with an American rye and throws in a measure of Canadian rye and a splash of port. Okay, sure. A dark, almost ruby-ish colour. Nice--if light--nose: leads with red fruits (lots of berry), clove, vanilla, a tiny bit of Beam peanut funk, some baking spice and green herbs. Sourdough bread. Yeasty--it actually reminds me of the way my hometown smelled when the Hiram Walker distillery was in the process of fermenting. A little bit of ginger, some pickle juice. Gravel. Taste is light and again leads sweet--the red fruits from the port, followed by a bit of vanilla and butterscotch, and the spicy, herbacious rye coming through just a bit at the end. The finish is strangely sour and tangy: vinous, a whiff of vanilla, and then it's gone.  Aside from that finish, this whisky is nice enough (if maybe leaning a bit too sweet), but it's hamstrung by two fatal flaws: a super-low ABV (baseline 40% for, *sigh*, ""smoothness""), and a pretty unreasonable price ($69 Cdn. out here Alberta-ways). Drop the price and raise the ABV and you've got a winner here. Which, come to think of it, is exactly what I say about everything carrying the Basil Hayden name."

This RYE is for you my friend (lord knows you’ve been telling people about rye for a while now anyway)- the taste is ORGANIC, chalky, dry, earthy, unsweetened chocolate, instant coffee minus the coffee flavor, unfiltered rye distillate.

I honestly loved this because it was different. Doesn't smell or taste like a normal bourbon or whiskey but I don't think it was meant to. Strong sweet nose of cab and port wines.  No bite or burn at all really. Sweet and really nutty finish. All the wine drinkers that have had some at my place have really liked it. Nice to have in the collection."

A blended rye influenced heavily with Kentucky rye, followed by Canadian rye from their Alberta distillery, and then blended with a touch of California port. Smells exactly like a wine bottle when you open it up, which I found very interesting, and goes down like silk with those port notes and sweet fruity undertones, with a slight variation of a classic rye finish. Well worth the price and adventure to try a one if a kind whiskey."

I’m smelling wine and clay on the nose with a little bit of corn fighting for attention in the background. 
Sweet sangria, clay and oak fill out the palate with some mild spice coming in right at the end. The faintest of burns coats the back of your throat on the way down.
The mouthfeel is medium.
I suppose I enjoy this (now) a bit more than I did as a “first experience”. As a newly popped bottle, this drank more like grape Play-Doh than anything else. I even returned the second bottle I had purchased out of shear disappointment.
Now, at the end of the bottle (my wife obviously likes it), I can say it’s at least drinkable. While, as a bit of a purist, I don’t really approve of the addition of actual wine to the blend...it’s a nice, sweet after-dinner sipper. 3.65."

4.0,"Upon organizing a small 'finished rye' tasting I realized I wouldn't make it to Kentucky to pick up my rye of choice, so pinch hitting for Woodfords Wine Cask  finished rye today is non other than Basil Haydens Dark(port added) Rye.  The other contenders, Angels Envy Rum Finished,  High Wests Midwinter Act 7 (port finished), (we had a no show for James Pepper).   

So how did the pedestrian Basil Hayden match up to these heavy hitters?  Choice by nose complexity, character and quality.

1 Basil Hayden
2 Angels Envy
3 Midwinters

By taste: 

Tie: Angels Envy - Basil Hayden
3rd Midwinters

The group agreed that the overall sweetness and rich character added by Basils port matched up to Rum factor in the Angels with the later winning in the ""sweet"" category while the Basils had just a bit more character in deep richness.   Midwinters came in last as the finish was mild to subdued and  really just notable.

In over all value the relative msrp's  again found Basil just edging out the much higher priced Angels while the Midwinters again lagged.   Overall  rich rye's,  hot chilli and good cigars were consumed in good spirits for what went over as a good head to head taste off and somewhat surprisingly little Basil punched well over it's weight to take the event.   We all were somewhat amazed the Basil Hayden could deliver at that level, esp with a pair like the Angels Envy and Midwinters in the house.  For me the richness of the port addition made it an easy winner and if the ""finish"" technique is of questionable fairness in comparison at the end of the day it's the taste that counts.   With the Angels Envy being about 10 dollars more than the High West, it was a unanimous 2nd in value and nose to nose in quality of drink with Basils.  That alone is some serious recommendation for what Basil Hayden is doing with it's dark rye addition.   Rye drinkers who desire a real change up in sweet richness should give serious consideration to this dark and spicy blend."

4.25,"Let's start by saying this is a nice drink on the rocks. It is more of a cocktail in a bottle than a straight whiskey so all of the negativee comments can pound sand. 

What it isn't - a top shelf straight drinker.

What it is - a lovely port and whiskey blend that does fantastic over a few cubes. My reccomendation is that you have a healthy pour over ice and ignore the naysayers!"

To be blunt this is great as finished whiskey, but far from good straight whiskey.

A great whiskey full of dark fruits and a light nuttiness. Great for a Manhattan or someone looking to drink something heavily finished. 

I sub this for vermouth in Manhattans and have blended it with their rum finish to make a great cocktail."

2.25,"Waiting for take out I decided to grab a pour of this one... What's unique about this one is it's a blend of their rye with Canadian Whiskey and Port (added not finished in a port barrel). Like all Basil Haden products it's bottled at 40% ABV. Let's dive in:

On the palette it's thick, sweet and syrupy. Lots of candied berry notes that lean towards artificial tasting. Some spice shows itself on the mid palette with a bit of oak on the short finish. It's definitely very sweet. This is an after dinner dram for those with a sweet tooth. 

My personal preference is to avoid anything that has artificial sweet notes and on this one I get those notes. So it's a pass for me. For those who are fans of syrupy and sweet Whiskey try before you buy! 

Cheers all!"

Nose: Oak spice, and that sweet port 

Palate: A toasty rye bread, a subtle dry oak, followed by a lengthy molasses and black tea finish.

Final impression: i have never really been of basil hayden, but the rye has me questioning my taste of this Jim Beam small batch line. I would recommend this to a rye fan that is looking for something a little different"

3.0,"Decent “whiskey”. I think the expert’s comment that this whiskey is “one-dimensional” is accurate. The port imparts some nice flavor (if you enjoy port), but it just feels flat in your mouth. I’m reminded of Angel’s Envy Bourbon, finished in Port Barrels. You can definitely taste the port in that whiskey, but the flavors are deep and subtle. 

The Basil Hayden’s just tastes like Rye whiskey mixed with Port wine. Like I could mix up a new bottle in my kitchen. I guess that’s what it really is, but it’d probably be 4 stars for me if it was blended and then finished in a port barrel. Then again, it’d probably be $50+ instead of $35. You get what you pay for sometimes."

4.0,"Color is dark golden red. Legs are notably quick moving. Nose has obvious hints of red wine with rye spiciness and sweet vanilla underneath. Palate surprisingly switches to vanilla and fruit dominant with the red wine and rye flavors more as undertones. Finish is medium, smooth, and sweet. A unique whiskey that I would recommend for wine lovers."
3.5,"Nose: Like waving your hand toward your nose to smell a freshly popped jar of prunes, plums, pommagranite and cherry jam. Afternotes of vanilla, dark chocolate and mild coffee grinds. 

Pallette: Mild intro to vanilla with a pop of sweet port wine. The taste comes and goes quickly with a short after flavor of cherries. Very subtle alcohol.

General: Sadly it lacks the spice of a true rye. Very much a whiskey version of port wine that would work well with desserts and possibly cigars."

Not knowing what to expect.... I dove in. 
The nose is sweet, with the definite hints of vanilla. The subtle rye spice hits as well. The palate is where it gets a bit interesting. The port comes through with its sweetness immediately. You get some oak and leather tones.... as well as dark fruits. It’s very palatable. It reminds me of something... and on the second taste, I place it. This literally reminds me of drinking a Manhattan. As you taste it, imagine it with a Luxardo cherry. The oil is there, and lingers on the aftertaste.
I was pleasantly surprised with this pour. I will be keeping this stocked for a while"

As a big fan of port wine, I'm glad this is a regular in their line. Sweetness from the Canadian wine make it almost too much. But with ice I think this will make a great sipper and  cut the sweetness a bit."

2.0,"Enjoyed neat from a rocks glass at a restaurant.  This is going to be a short review.

This is sweet (ish), fruity (ish), cloying, and mostly inoffensive.  It is not, however, a rye.  There's nothing rye-like to speak of. There's very little to the (short) finish. No spices. No crazy fruitcake notes. No pepper.  No complexity.  No spark.

What is there?

Whatever it was bored the bejesus out of me.  Pour an indifferent port into a indifferent rye and you'll end up with something like this. 

I don't like it and I'm certainly not spending money to buy a bottle after this tasting. I can think of  half a dozen other whiskies I'd rather have, and all priced under $20 per bottle.

This is a rye for people who don't like rye... or  whiskey.

Hard pass"

Nose - I get plums and brown sugar right away, then a sour mustiness comes though. Way in the background a get a touch of rye spice.

Finish - The sour port flavors linger for awhile, with a touch if rye spice. Probably my least favorite part of the experience."

3.5,"This interesting treat is a dark pigskin leather brown. And very thin oily legs dribble down the glass.

The nose is quite fruity. There are notes of grape skins, cherry, vanilla, brown sugar, maple syrup, bread yeast, cinnamon, and a reminiscent scent of a craft store.

The palate is watery, and notes of red wine, plum, dark chocolate covered cherries, and waxy pecan and cashew meld together. It’s a Christmasy flavor that is really unique.

The shorter finish ends not unpleasantly peppery and fruity.

This rye threw me off at first when a buddy served me a glass, and I thought was strange until I read up on what it was. With the addition of port wine it really adds a dominant fruity layer, making it a whiskey I believe a wine lover would enjoy. Also the notes bespeak the holidays, so thoughI wouldn’t want it all the time, I may just buy a bottle come Christmas! Beam, thanks for the interesting dram. Cheers!"

3.75,"A very interesting whiskey, a blend of two rye whiskies and a cask finish in californian port wood gives this dram a strange palette of flavors, some that i have never had before in a dram. 

Bottled at 40%abv, Chesnut color, very red.

On the nose: Rye upfront. Cherries, Red fruits and strawberry Jam.

On the palate: here things get crazy. Starts sour. Normal Syrup. Sweet and sour. Then gets Yeasty. Sugary and prunes. Very rare flavor. Not bad. Not amazing though. 

Aftertaste has notes of prunes and lemoncello. 

Overall this is a very interesting maybe awkward dram, to drink it neat is quite the experience, but i am sure this makes great cocktails. 78 over 100."
