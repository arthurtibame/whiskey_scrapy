3.0,"So this local aged moonshine is orange amber in color and has thick viscous legs coming down the glass.

The nose is sweet and quite interesting with notes of caramel, cotton candy, strawberry yogurt, Raisin Bran cereal, and dry straw.

The palate is simple but sweet with earthiness, Froot Loops cereal, and black tea with Stevia sweetener.

There is an initial back of the throat heat, accompanying a medium-long dry finish."
