4.25,"I've tried the Yamato whisky and it was good, very drinkable, but the Yamato Special Edition is on another level.  The whisky is full of flavor and it goes down well, as is.  No water needed."

4.0,"Tried a slug of this at a local, just wanting to give another Japanese product the rundown.  The squarish dimpled (IWHarper like) bottle is unmistakable with the large Yamato under lined in red. This is intriguing stuff, if about what I was expecting.

Nose: Dry fruit forward,, tart pear and crisp apple,  slight sweet hints like a honey dew nectar with some warmer spices as well.  No hints of malt yet,  yep, that's what I was hoping for.

Front: Ah there's the malt, knew it, but that's ok as the dry fruit holds up and keeps pace, here is where the Eastern influence takes over and we find small nibs of barrel and garden herb with florals, the sugars are mild as this is a dry note work, the spectrum is very agreeable but unfortunately not for long.  The middle is very swift to give way to a finish of nice dry black pepper and salt, warm not hot, fading out.  

For a cask strength this seems entirely mild and pleasant and while the malt is obvious this one carries the variety I like not found in the pure malts ala Nikka, which I find bland and not worthy of review.    Some youngish juice probably belies the NAS as it seems a little thin, yet blended well enough to hide any glaring deficiencies.  No idea on the cost so rated purely on taste.  Cheers!"
