5.0,I find this a very mellow and smooth Bourbon. Oak with hints of vanilla and pepper. The Costco liquor buyers are always spot on; the same goes with this one.

0.25,"The title, “Three Rivers Wheated Bourbon” is only 50% correct. It does indeed taste like what I’d expect bottled river water to taste like, but classifying it as a bourbon is an insult to other choices carrying the same label. A previous reviewer mentioned it tasted like freshly-cut grass—that’s likely clippings that washed into a storm sewer and made its way into one of the Three Rivers this batch was sourced from..."
1.75,"It smells like cardboard and alcohol and taste of paper, raw oats, and grass. The grassy note is what you’re left with on your palate for a bit. 

The best part about this whiskey is that a friend purchased it and not me. Glad I had a chance to taste it before I spent my money on it. I would not buy this."
2.0,Definitely young.
5.0,"Has a little bit of a woody taste, but otherwise good flavor and easy to drink"
