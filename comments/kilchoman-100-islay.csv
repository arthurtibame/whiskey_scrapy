5.0,Pear & cinnamon edge out the peat in the nose. Peat grows stronger on the palate with creamy banana & vanilla notes. Iced lemon cookies. Water a must.

2.0,Less fruity than the 3rd edition. Good amount of peat and smoke but odd notes of oil and petrol . Thankfully the odd notes were slight. But I would not repurchase this one.

4.0,"Crystal straw colored. A creamy peat on the nose, with green mowed grass and bright pale berries. The cream dominates the nose and manages a juggling of sweet and almost rotted notes. Washes fresh over the tongue, brightly acidic despite the moderate peat and that this is the bottom of the bottle now. A thin smokiness surrounds a confident green palate. There's almost something footy there and sweet like a cognac. Really one of the more interesting and dynamic drams I've had. Looking forward to opening the next one."
