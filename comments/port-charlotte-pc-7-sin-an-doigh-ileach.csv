5.0,Simply amazing Islay! Comes in at 60% but with a little water opens up beautifully!  The nose makes you think you are standing right there at the port next to the sea.  The peat is strong but smooth and it yet has a sweet smooth finish! If you see this anywhere... grab it!

4.75,"Oct 2019.
Clear light gold.
Aromatic iodine, farmyard, campfire, oily brine and warm rich peated smoky in nose.
Sea salt, shore rocks, seaweed, warm rich oily malt biscuits, and some hospital iodine in palate.
Awesome balance high long isle finish."
5.0,"Nose is marmalade, cottage cheese, butter, rubber, lemon rind, peat smoke, and loads of funk. In the palate there's ample peat, with lots of soot and ash, medium brine, before giving way to a long finish full of tar, ash, and a strong drying bitterness rife with peat smoke.

Seriously one of the best Islays I've ever had."
3.25,"Representing isle of islay

Nose: sweet peat and smoke, apricot (sherry?), raisin, earthy, grassy, mossy and old oak

Body: full and smooth (surprising given its 60+% proof)

Palate: huge peat and smoke, mild spice, dried smoky raisins and maybe smoky meat

Finish medium to long and warm

Note: I am not a huge super peat and smoke guy, that said I appreciate how this scotch is crafted. It’s easy to drink with powerful flavor. I like the balance. This got better the longer I sipped it. Any friends that like peat will love this."
