4.5,"Very pleasant whisky, it is better on the palate than in the nose. A tipical Macallan Flavor and profile.

On the nose you get Medicinal plants, Coffee, butterscotch, a very Small peat maybe not peatiness but Very perfumed. I also got Tobacco notes.

On the palate is Sweet and Spicy with a remarkable Plum flavor that turns into a Complex flavor of Tabacco, Oak, and Cinnabon. Short finish but Very pleasant"

3.0,"On the nose, fruity, citric, sweet and something floral in the background. Notes of apple, lemon and fresh grass are present. On the taste, light, with a little bit of spices and honey, with a medium to long finish, with notes of caramel and nuts. The perfect whisky to go with a good chocolate"

4.0,"Very nice drop with a wonderful aroma and colour.  The Nose has distinctive butterscotch,  toffee and honey.  The Taste is a warm,  thick,  chewy and gorgeous.  Long legs after a sip shows a great whisky.  Caramel, vanilla and honey.  The Finish is long lasting with a wonderful bite and lingering after-taste of spice.  Could easily be an everyday dram!"

3.0,"Neat in a glencairn, got a bottle as a gift.

 Awfully dark golden colour for a NAS whisky...

Buttered toast and a wet grainy smell, with the faintest hint of floral notes.

Light light light on the palate! Reminiscent of an Irish whisky, with a honey roundness and some mild oak on the finish.

Not my favourite dram, just a bit too mild (bland?) for my taste. But I'm weird... so give it a shot if you want."

3.5,"Sherry note are on the upper level so you get those dry berries straight away while American oak and the wood spice are always in the lower level hidden in the background.

There is a tiny hint of grass and bitter notes from American Oak after finish as if you chew on the grass. 

Is it worth over $100 NZ dollors, for me it's not. It should be price around $65 but it's macallan so..."
