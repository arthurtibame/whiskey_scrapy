3.0,"The pear on the nose is an invitation to enjoy this easy sipping sweet, syrupy Scotch. The full-bodied sweetness gives way to a buttery walnut finish."

4.0,Creamy and spicy. Bread. Subtle. Pleasant. 10/9/17
3.5,"I actually did not take any notes while drinking it, so i will be precise in what i remember of it. It wasn't that great, with honey notes on the nose, vanilla and some oak.

The palate was a little regular, honey also, peppery notes and hints of chocolate. Too simple.

Overall i give this dram a fair 73 over 100. A little overpriced for $110."

2.75,"This is the third installment in the Glenmorangie Legends Collection:  The Tarlogan.  It follows the previous releases of Duthac and Tayne.  All 3 releases are travel retail exclusives designed to represent locations in and around the distillery.  The Tarlogan is named for the Tarlogie water source used by the distillery.  Its a blend of whisky that was matured in virgin oak and ex-bourbon casks.  It’s a pale, straw yellow in the Glencairn and produces watery, thin legs and medium-sized drops after you give it a spin.  It’s bottled at 43% ABV and I picked the bottle up online from Whisky World for $46.

The nose starts with a lightly, charred oak, apples, pears and fresh muddled spearmint.  There’s an intrusive menthol and eucalyptus note that permeates the entire dram before ultimately yielding to typical ex-bourbon barrel standards like vanilla, leather tannins and sawdust.  The palate is a bit more adventurous:  pears, banana bread, berry fruits and apples.  The spirit is young and can’t be masked, especially when aged in virgin oak, so it’s naturally harsh and somewhat hot, even though it’s blended down to 43%.  The thin mouthfeel allows all the abrasive aspects to wreak havoc on the tongue.  The finish is medium-short and very dry.  It ultimately tastes and feels like you’ve licked the inside of the cask.  Wood, wood and more wood.

Overall, I’ve tried the Duthac and found it to be just like this one:  very middle-of-the-road and uninspired.  Reviews of The Tayne lead me to believe it’s the best of the 3 Legends Collection releases and the one to seek out.  This, unfortunately, is just more TRE/NAS mediocrity from Glenmorangie.  I can’t recommend it to anyone other than ‘Morangie fanboys.  2.5-2.75 stars.  Cheers."

3.25,"It happens to be a slight disappointment due to the rather high expectations towards it.
The colour is old dusty gold.
The nose is a bit spiritous at first but after a short aeration it acquires something like an oakish frame with classic sweet terms - caramel, honey, creamy vanilla - along with some bitter/sour fruits and ashberry and well expressed grain notes (surprising due to its single malt origin).
The taste is again a classic sweet Glenmorangie - honey, toffee, caramel, some citruses. Some spices and ginger notes can be mentioned too.
As it was quoted on one of the websites: “it seems to be there a conflict between the well-aged spirits with the younger ones”, what is probably true.
The finish is nice what is a tradition to Glenmorangie and it little matters whether a whisky was really good or near to average. The aftertaste contains all the hints mentioned above with something that reminds litchee. Not very long and not very short - nice in a word."
3.75,"Tarlogan 
Dried fruit smooth light not complex liked tante and duthac more by a bit tasted along with many others so may be compromised"
