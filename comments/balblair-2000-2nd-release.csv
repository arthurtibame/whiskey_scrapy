4.5,"The info on this is wrong. It's not an NAS whisky. Balblair just do their age statements a little differently. They have the year of distillation  and the year of bottling on the label. This was distilled in 2000 and bottled in 2017. Making it a minimum of 16 years old.

It's a cracking whisky. Distinctly highland in style. With fruits, cereal and heather notes. Goes quite dry and salty as it develops. No peat. Very complex. Needs a lot of time in the glass to open up and a teaspoon of water. Lovely stuff. Definitely one of the best malts I've had lately."
