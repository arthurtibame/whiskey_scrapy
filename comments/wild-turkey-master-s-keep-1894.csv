4.0,Very smooth velvety finish. Sweet but not too sweet to a pleasant degree. Quite floral. Does not have a bite to it unlike cheap bourbon.
4.25,"Nose is very fruity and sweet. Sweet corn and barley. 

Very sweet taste with hints of honey and toffee. Somewhat of an undertone of bananas and baked pears. 

Very oaky. Minimal heat but a lot of spice."

4.0,"Honey on the nose and super floral on the palate. It's a real polished bourban with an elegant finish.
