4.0,"Nose - (w/o water) Dark leather, vanilla, dark oaky caramel, lightly herbal, hint of dried cherries, dark cocoa powder (w/ water) Softens the nose a bit, more fruity/floral versus dark tones, more caramel sweet.

Taste - (w/o water) Fruity cinnamon heat, dry, cherry vanilla, dark caramel, cocoa nib bittersweet (w/ water) Light sweet mint, dry, cinnamon spice, sweet vanilla caramels, light cherry.

Finish - (w/o water) Linge4ring fruity cinnamon heat, light toasted sweet oak bitter/tannins, dark chocolate cherry, dry (w/ water) More mouth drying somehow, light herbal/minty cherry, light tannic cherry.

Score - 85/100

Final Thoughts - This was an interesting one in that on the nose it screamed dark leather, dark fruits, oak, but once it hit the palate, it was something completely different. It had a ""dark"" vibe to it, but it was subtle and quite pleasant, minus the mouth drying qualities to it. Nice taste & finish throughout and the addition of water did change the dynamic of it, but not by much. It opened up some herbal, almost rye-like notes on the palate, but somehow ended up making it more mouth-drying than it did neat. Regardless, a tasty dram but the mouth-drying nature of it was quite strange.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

3.0,"Very full nose, rich fruit and honey. Palate is muted. Very smooth. Sweet notes. Some wood. Spice creeps in later. Need to revisit. 8/24/18"

3.0,"Surprisingly, for all it’s hype and hysteria, I wasn’t impressed by last year’s release.  I’ve had the 2016, 2014, and this 2017.  2016 was  the best followed by a close second on rhe 2014, and this way behind.  It has all the caramel, but with way too much  heat, and not the lasting complexity of the  2016 or 2014.  Just a quick hot finish.  Glad I bought a pour and not the full bottle."
2.5,"Nose:  vanilla & caramel as well a a spice I can't quite place but it reminds one of Christmas...
Color I find unimportant as it really does not effect my enjoyment of this or any other drink. 
Taste: very light oil at first, again slight vanilla. 
most of the flavor drops off for me leaving only burning, an enjoyable burn but still a burn. 
Adding water is almost a must, just a few drops and it changes completely, the burn takes longer to start letting you enjoy the subtlety longer. 

All in all it is too subtle for me. I find myself chasing the complexity but never quite catching it."

null,"Mild, smooth, delicate taste- not bold and spicy as one might expect at this level of consumer desire - there’s a zillion little flavor profiles going on in this pour, it’s and interesting mix and hard to nail down. I wonder what their angle is on this one? I’m reminded very much of WT diamond, forgiven, and a mild mild blantons.. I’ll taste it again and get back with flavor notes."

4.0,Definite nose of tobacco and vanilla. Pallet is leather and dark fruit but finishes with some caramel notes
5.0,"This is my favorite bourbon. Based on the recipe, I didn’t think I would be overly impressed with this batch. However, the nose explodes with juicy fruit, the palate is so good, again, juicy fruit. If you have a chance to try it, don’t hesitate."

4.0,"Not my cup of tea at first. Hot with a ton of spice, but lacks the sweetness of a true bourbon and the nuance of a high rye. I suspect it would go well in an old fashioned but obviously you’re not pulling this bottle off the shelf for that. 

This gets significantly better as it opens up. The sweetness intensifies, the spice mellows into rich cinnamon, warm oak, black pepper and chocolate. The finish is medium at best."
4.75,Very good lots of cherry oak and a tobacco finish.

4.75,"The nose starts with charred oak, bitterly vanilla, floral rye and fruity notes of apricot cookies and fresh grain. It all carries over nicely to the palate with buttery vanilla being dominate, along with the floral rye balancing it out with a mild pepperyness bringing it all together. The finish is long and spicy with oak and vanilla and linger with fading rye. Excellent."
