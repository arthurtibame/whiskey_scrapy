1.0,"The nose jars you immediately with ethanol, not a good sign - this whiskey is young.  Underneath the kitchen chemical there's some grassy, hay notes.  

On the palate it's initially sweet - but unsophisticated.  Huge alcohol burn after, Sight hints of honey and green things (and, strangely, bubblegum on the nose just before the liquid hits the palate).  Finish is dry and slightly bitter (bitter melon?) with eventual fruity gum note.

Honestly, I can't see how this is so far from a typical Single Malt Whisky profile.  It's 100% malted barley, aged in refill barrels.  It's not just the youth - there's just a lack of sophistication here.  Had the producers ever had single malt whisky?"

3.0,Pretty smooth single malt but lacking in deep complexity.  Pretty much a peaty up front flavor with a slight honey finish.
