4.0,"Really lovely. The nose offers up some peat and sea air (Islay light), but also a bit of vanilla custard. On the palate, there's a bright, fresh burst of malt that settles into a rich, almost fudgy vanilla profile,  sprinkled with salt and just enough peat. Complex, engaging, and delicious."

3.0,It's yellow-gold color has more flavor than it appears. It's also hard to detect any strong smell. But take a sip and you get a smooth start with a mild peaty finish and a dash of smoke.

null,I tried the cask strength at 58.5%. Soft smell but very strong palette with hints of turf and vanilla. Medium finish.

5.0,Who let the dogs out?! Woof! Bought this one on a whim and full of apprehension. Now regretting not having a bigger whim then! Lovely peaty vanilla nose and some of it translates on the palate as well!

3.5,"Much better on the second go.  Smokey, light but oily, a bit citric and crisp.  sour on the finish"

4.0,"Sweet, light, floral, and a touch of peat that rounds off the backside after a taste. Delicious and masterfully balanced."
2.5,3rd edition - Too citric and salty for me on initial trial.

4.0,Really enjoyed this. It needs quite a bit of time in the glass to open up but when it does it is a perfectly balanced and quite unique dram. The peat plays a background role and complements the sweetness. Very different to other Arran I have tried

3.5,"I recently discovered Arran as something really positively different and very enjoyable. But I also like lightly and medium peated whiskies. So I got a bottle of the 7th edition from a monthly sale at my local whisky store (just two days before it had to close because of COVID-19).  

Nose: wooden chimney fire smoke but only at a slight level (this is a I would say medium peated whisky), very direct and not much playing around, very sweet and light fruits, pineapple, grapefruit, fruity trail mix ... all in all very delicate with a very well integrated peat. On second nose there is a lot of vanilla. Lots of vanilla in playful harmony with the smokey peat. 

Only little flaw is that it isn’t very intense or deep and more on the light side of nosing aromas but that is nothing too upsetting given the assuming young age (being a NAS). 

Palate: first a welcoming sweetness, getting oily quickly, citrus, grapefruit juice and heavily roasted crispy bread, dried plums / prunes, a slight peppery burn, a good amount of smoke that is increasing with every sip making tis whisky much more serious than on the first impression, but it remains very delicate in combination with the nose adding new layers every time. 

A few drops of water broadens the range and makes it more accessible. 

Finish: short to medium with a smokey after taste - what remains in the end is a vibrant peaty smoke and burned sugar

I am happy I got a bottle of this one. It didn’t disappoint and even though I was expecting something else, it definitely is a whisky I will happily return to frequently. A very nice surprise and experience."
