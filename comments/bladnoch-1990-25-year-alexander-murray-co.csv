3.75,"Light in color. I found a sweet, floral nose with hints of malted barley. The palate it is sweet, smooth and carries a hint of citrus fruits and bananas. The finish is long and seems to carry for a while. (It should be noted that my taste buds are still recovering after cancer treatment so my palate is limited....all in all it is an enjoyable dram.)"
