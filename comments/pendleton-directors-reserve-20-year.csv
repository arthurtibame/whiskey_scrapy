4.75,"Wow!  Smooth- easy to drink. Vanilla, sweet, oak notes fill the room after a sip of this whiskey. The age lingers on the tongue and the taste of care permeates the bottle. 

Nicely done."
3.0,Isopropyl and a bit sour on the nose. Extremely light and smooth in the mouth. Buttery. Having trouble placing other flavors.
5.0,"So creamy, slight citrus, semi-sweet, and a soft finish"

Nose - Sweet caramel, vanilla, orange zest, hints of chocolate, toffee

Taste - Sweet vanilla caramels, creamy butterscotch, hints of chocolate covered oranges, very rich/creamy for the lower proof, dark chocolate, maple syrup

Finish - Creamy caramels, milky chocolate, light cinnamon spice, chocolate covered Werthers candies, light maple syrup, oak

Score - 87/100

Final Thoughts - Upon pouring into the glass and the first initial nose, I immediately think of a bourbon with the strong caramel/vanilla notes. There seems to be a fairly high corn content as it drinks like a very smooth amazingly not too overoaked bourbon. Without really knowing the mashbill or anything else it's a very inoffensive, very easy drinking bourbon-like whisky. The maple syrup is funnily very Canadian. That being said, it's very easy to drink, but nothing about it screams amazing. It's nicely balanced, a bit on the sweet side with nice caramel/chocolate/maple syrup notes. Sadly the maple syrup notes make it borderline splenda-like, but not quite.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - Probably not another"
