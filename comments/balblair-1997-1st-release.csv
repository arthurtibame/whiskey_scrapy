4.25,"Fruity up front (I get citrus, mostly, with some orchard and stone fruit) with floral honey and vanilla in the distance. Surprisingly hefty body with a very balanced mouthfeel, with fruity and malty sweetness, plus a little peppery spice in a medium-lasting finish. Very, very, very good scotch."

4.25,"(Review for Balblair 97 2nd Ed.)

When it comes to whisky, (almost) everyone loves some peat and different casks thrown in the mix but sometimes all you need is a plain unpeated malt aged solely in ex-bourbon casks.

This Balblair is 14/15 years old, 46% abv, NFC, beautiful natural golden color and aged only in 1st fill ex-bourbon casks.

The nose is a flavor bomb of tropical fresh fruits: pineapple, banana and citrusy fruits, some sweet vanilla, all wrapped by a hard to explain floral aroma. DELICIOUS! 

The palate is gorgeous with a very thick mouthfeel, a sweet taste and a very long finish with a welcome spicy kick, just to keep things interesting.

Bravo Balblair!"

I have to borrow neuroscientific language to properly review this scotch: the dopamine load in the reward centre of my brain following a taste of this expression was overwhelming. In other words, MINDFORNICATING!
    
Chamomile on the nose with a touch of honey and pears. The palate is creamy and mouth-coating, with brown sugar, vanilla, wood spices, and what I imagine everthing Jesus, Confucius and the Buddha were trying to teach us about encountering the divine and perfect.
    
A revelation! (Now go and sin no more with cheap liquor.)"
