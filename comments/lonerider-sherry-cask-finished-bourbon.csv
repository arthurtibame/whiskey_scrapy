5.0,Smooth!
3.0,I am not a sherry cast person but this one is not too bad
2.75,A spicier bourbon. Initial spice of cinnamon and anise with a strong layer of sherry. Astringent finish of a bourbon that could use more time in the barrel.

2.25,"This review is going to be difficult for me.  I met the man behind Lonerider at a culinary conference in Raleigh, NC a few years ago. He is a really good guy and his microbrews are fantastic. I am partial to the Shotgun Betty hefeweizen.  A friend shared a sample to taste of the Sherry cask finished bourbon.  

The flavors, while not remarkable, are not bad. There are no off flavors or lingering swill aftertastes.  There is apple and other fruity tones in the nose and initial taste, but not a lot of anything remarkable.  I can definitely taste the Sherry cask influence which softens up flavors a bit. I like what this offers, but I have a couple problems. This is sourced juice.  I understand the, ""necessity"" and I am okay with that.  It is locally finished and bottled but, why would one buy this?  This brings nothing really extra to the party.  Also, it is not a particularly affordable bottle either.  For the $40 I can score many of my go-to bottles.(see my fair ratings)  

I know the good folks at Lonerider believe in themselves and know how to create good beverage.  I will just have to be patient and wait for their home juice in few years.  Again, this is why distillers like New Riff get extra points from me.  Whenever you see Lonerider Shotgun Betty on tap at a watering hole, order a pour. It's especially good with assertive foods. (Ribs, wings etc)."

3.0,spice little over whelming but still good. probably go well as an old fashioned
2.25,"To me, anise flavored which is too strong to enjoy it"
2.5,"Sourced High Rye Bourbon finished in Sherried Casks.(Purchased a 50ml bottle/750ml runs about $40).
APPEARANCE: Strawberry Blonde in color.
NOSE: Smells young. Youthful heat and Spicy Rye. Young Oak. Prominent Sherry. Floral and Fruity. Almost has a scotch-ish nose. 
NEAT: Here the youth is confirmed. Thin and hot. Slightly Oaky. Astringent and Spicy. The Sherry dominates, making it difficult to pick up any other notes (if there are any there at all). With time it develops some hints of Apple and Pear. Finishes hot with Sherry, Oak and Tingly Pepper coating.
SPLASH: Tames some of the heat on the nose and allows some of the fruit notes to come to the front. Doesn't do much for the palate other than tame some of the heat on the finish.
VERDICT: As a fan of their beers (Lonerider is one of the largest craft breweries in NC) and a fellow North Carolinian, I wanted to like this one. I think there is potential here, but the whiskey they are sourcing is apparently very young. It seems if you were going to go to all the trouble to source (which I have absolutely zero issue with) you should at least purchase whiskey with some decent age already on it. I'm hoping that in a couple years I can re-visit this one and have a more positive review."
