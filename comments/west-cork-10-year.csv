3.0,"Very similar profile to the Tyrconnell and Tullamore Dew.  Sweet candied vanilla and a fruity palate. Sour apple, and less on banana.  The finish feels grassy, oily, and a little bitter where the sweetness lingers just a tad longer.  There is a burn on the tongue afterward. It has interesting complexity, and has the potential to stand out amongst more well known products.  Worth trying out."

3.0,"This was another new-to-me offering from West Cork.  This one didn’t seem like there was a lot different going on from the other bottles availability at the festival.  They offer a couple of 12 year old malts, so this isn’t even that remarkable as an age statement whiskey.  There were some average cereal malt notes and a little more burn from the peppery casks notes.  I doubt I’d buy a full bottle of this one, but I am glad I got to try it.  Middle of the road from the guys at West Cork, I’d say, nothing more.

Update 9/3/18:
I ended up purchasing a bottle of this Irish whiskey locally about a month ago for the paltry sum of $32, so I thought I’d put it through its paces again to see if my initial feelings had changed.

This was a little better than what I observed at Whiskyfest, but it’s still nothing more than a middle of the road 10 year old, Irish whiskey.  To date, every West Cork I’ve tried seem to be more lively than all of their Irish brethren.  The oak is more in your face here, and I’d say they more closely resemble American bourbon.  In that argument, I prefer them over the Jameson’s and Redbreast’s.  This whiskey could use a bit of a boost in flavor, but perhaps that’s because the time in the cask has prohibited it.  I still have to say that it’s a solid 3.5 star whiskey on its own and a definite change of pace for an Irish.

These guys also continue to be self-owned and distributed, so that’s also cool to help the little guy.  If you see a bottle or two on your local shelf grab it and show them some love- you may just find out you love the change of pace they provide over other Irish whiskey.  Cheers."

4.0,I didn't really taste it so much as I drank it. Definitely did the job. Strong. Rich
3.75,VERY friendly...more complex than I was expecting. Vanilla and light fruit for miles. Pear....almost a perfume when you're at the end of your glass and only fumes are left. Bright cereal notes and overall is crisp!

1.5,Poor flavor. Very Oakey
3.75,"Nose and initial flavor burst is all green apple and pear with a touch of honeydew, honey, and marshmallow.  The sharp tang from the copper is prevalent as well as a distinct minerality. It’s good but a little too tame.  Water or ice would make this disappear."

4.0,"Lovely,, slightly spicy for Irish, and rather thin compared to a pot still"
3.0,"Dec 2017
Solid but unremarkable on its first outing. A 3 to 3.5 stars

Second outing on New Years Eve after Tyrconnell single malt and the Irishman Founders Reserve. Better than both of them. Light, fruity nose and sweet, vanilla palate. Definitely the higher of my previous rating options."

3.0,"Have wanted to try this for along time. Closeout at Total Wine for $24 made it easy. Poured neat, nose is soft and subdued like most Irish. Black tea, heather and honeysuckle with gentle wood and mild sweetness. Palate is more tea, red licorice, dry autumn leaves, mild malt, seasoned oak and a couple puffs of smoke. Finish is dry sandalwood, fading dry barley malt and light sweetness. Its all easy and smooth without any power or depth to the experience. This is what Irish is with its triple distillation stripping away the meat off the bone. Still this is a nice elegant single malt that I cant help but think would be much better with just two times through the stills. It has some unique flavors and is pleasant enough that I do enjoy this whisky....81/100 Irish score. Sometimes you want a mild easy whisky"

3.75,"The nose of the whiskey features cereal notes along with a sweetness that is somewhere between caramel and toffee.

On the tongue the drink possesses a smooth and velvety mouthfeel and a pleasant burn that does not bite in the throat as it settles in the chest.  The flavor profile consists of cereal notes once again with just a hint of berry in the finish.

A good whiskey, best enjoyed neat."

3.75,"Pleasantly surprised: corn, spice... Bit shallow aftertaste, but very drinkable. Enjoyable."
3.5,"Nose: Sweetness shines through, with vanilla, apples and marzipan. Some citrus notes emerging as well.
Taste: Very light, with fruit flavours (especially apple) quickly emerging on the tongue. Smooth, with little burn, or indeed lingering aftertaste.

A very easy to drink dram, especially if you want something light, easy, and not overly complex."
3.5,"Probably wouldn’t buy again. It’s not bad, though. It’s just missing something. Has the shortbread and cereal flavors I expect from an Irish. A bit oily and viscous with a mild kick of spice. Sticks around a bit. It’s like eating a trefoil cookie soaked in bourbon.

Updating: raising the rating a quarter as this fared ok in the blind st patty day tasting."
