4.0,"We ended up on a family holiday to Perth, Australia a) Because I'd never been there and b) I wanted to visit the famed Margaret River vineyard region. As usual happens the main course of wine got followed up with dessert of whiskey. I popped into this distillery on the way back from Swann Valley vineyards and was the only person in there at the time which was great as I could have a good chat to the person there. I asked why they used predominantly corn and the answer was that in WWII there was and American and Aussie aviators who flew together and in their spare time brewed Moonshine with corn. The owner of the distiller became good friends with the Aussie WWII vet and helped him write his memoirs, in return he was shown the recipe and how to distill the stuff. Several years later they have been distilling away and producing a range of stuff. Interestingly they avoided the gin, vodka route and plumbed for moonshine to show the progression of the spirit over time. Start as you want to finish I say.  This was a really interesting drop. Essentially it's their new make and it's very well done. Funky sweetness and more. Zero harshness, very very easy to drink. The best moonshine I've had. I asked why their produce aren't stupidly priced like other distilleries.  Apparently they deliberately wanted to price fairly and again start how they wanted to finish a solid value proposition. I ended up buying a bottle of both this and their Uphot whiskey."
