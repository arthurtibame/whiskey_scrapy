4.0,Starts with tinge of tobacco and dark chocolate notes leading to fresh and subtle earthy flavor having remnants of spices with long lasting but very lite smokiness that ends in spiced chocolaty flavor.

4.0,"It's the George T Stagg of Scotland... Leave it on your tongue and it will burn your tastebuds into a state of numb submission.

You could add water but what's the point of that when there's perfectly good saliva in your mouth?

Feel the burn, embrace the burn, enjoy the burn then linger in the nice sherry moment before you swallow and give the old liver a one/two...

Buy it, drink it respect it."

Sweet,smoky, briny, spicy. Stewed dark fruit.
Mouth coating and lingering. Campfire ash at the end.

Added 10 drops of water - tones down the alcohol and accentuates the flavors on the palate.

2nd dram of the day - World Whisky Day - May 16, 2015"
