3.0,"We recently went to a Dalmore vertical tasting hosted by Ben Boice, the brand's US ambassador.  This is the newest addition to the lineup, and Ben informed us that the average age of the whisky here is about 15 years.  There’s obviously much younger juice in here, however, because if they could put 15 on the bottle, I guarantee that they would have.  Its nose exhibits an alluring mixture of chocolate syrup (think ice cream sundaes with Hershey’s sauce) and clay.  The palate has more grip than I expected, and is appreciably thicker than the comparatively watery 12- and 15-year expressions.  However, it’s so sweet and sugary that I couldn’t imagine myself having a full 2-ounce pour, much less a second glass.  This scotch rounds out nicely with dried apricots, raspberries, some graham cracker, and toasted oak.  This is probably $20 too expensive, and lacks ideal balance, but at least it has a distinctive personality."

2.0,"Day 10. Dalmore Port. As you may know, I'm a sucker for Port finish, but so far the 2 non peated port finished whiskies I tried both have disappointed me (this and the other was Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban...but I might need to revisit that one outside of a Bar setting). 

The nose is very faint, bit of coffee bit of the usual malty notes, and some of my beloved dark fruits. 

Taste is equally disappointing. Dark fruits, a bit of honey, some coffee bitterness and the typical barley malt note that I tend to get from Dalmore. Not very exciting, not very delicious and all in all rather uninspiring. 

Aftertaste is a bit of bitterness and some fruit mixed in a non coherrent mess. 

So far, Dalmore fails to impress me. This is another failure. At least tomorrow is bound to be good...not sure if I can deliver a tasting note tomorrow though, got a dentist appointment, depending on how that goes....but with what's in store, the taste might be the same (tomorrow is Lagavulin 12 day).

So yeah, cheers. I'm gonna pour me a glass of Laphroaig 10 to get a more interesting taste in my mouth."
2.75,"Quick Hit Tasting Notes

Local liquor store had a Dalmore tasting. In non-optimal conditions, took some notes:
 
Nose: light,fruity,grape, plums. 
Palate : soft, grape, wood, fruit, cinnamon.
Finish: hot, pepper, wood, orange bitters.

It’s okay. Preferred the 12 over this."

5.0,Definite port on the nose and subtly sweet on the palate
2.25,"Syrupy cherry and port wine on the nose. Intense mouth feel, enveloping and warming. Spicy with a medium finish. Fruity and chocolatey flavor. Not nearly at as light as I was expecting, rich and full."

2.0,"Color: Basically Purple from the Port and added coloring. 

Nose: Musty and awkward smelling. Almost perfume like. The Port comes through very strongly much like the musk from your grandmothers house. 

Taste: Definitely still a Scotch many more dark fruits on the taste than a Glenfiddich or Glenlivet. It tastes of rich overripe figs, dates, and other dark fruits that make it seem almost more of a syrup or marmalade than a whiskey. Finish lingers for hours."

3.5,"Whisk(e)y: The Dalmore – Port Wood Reserve (46.5%)

Nose:

Give this dram a swirl and when nosing it you will be able to identify berries. This almost reminds me of raspberries which is subtle but quite refined with the quality.  Slight orange zest comes forward as well.  

Palate:

Your first sip will give a bit of heat on the front of the tongue and slowly make its way to the middle. After that there is no strong finish as it is quite smooth When swishing this around and letting it go down the hatch you get a back end taste of walnuts or cashew. Surprisingly there is a dark cherry finish which will dissipate quickly. Very interesting.

Overall: 

This is an interesting whisky. It say’s on The Dalmore website that this concoction sits in American oak casks for an unspecified amount of time and then half of its contents are placed into tawny port barrels. After an undisclosed time in those barrels it is then put back together to make the port wood reserve.
I kind of dig this dram to be honest. When I do my reviews I usually have to sit and enjoy the first session of having it. Once I go back on a different day I sometimes may be able to pull more out of the drink that I normally wouldn’t on day one. Price aside, I would rate this 3.5 / 5. It has some complexity but no shock value to rush out and grab a bottle. I would recommend ordering this at the bar to wet your whistle. For collectors this would be one of the bottles I would purchase after some of the others such as the 12, 18 and cigar malt.

Cheers,"

5.0,"A nice rich dessert dram with notes of raspberries, strawberries, tangerines, chocolate, toffee, figs, with a malted barley backbone. Reminds me of a richer Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban 12 Year."
4.5,Excellent
4.0,"Nose: distict notes of book binding with faint undertones of dried fruit.
Palate: A nice balance of brine and mash sit on your tongue with little to no noticable heat.  A very distracting lingering mash feel on the back of the tongue brings me back for more."

3.25,Candied orange and other subtle flavors. Good but not great
4.25,Very neat port smell off the nose. It’s a small quick burn which is surprising for something that’s a higher proof. The sweetness kicks in as well to have a very nice marriage of flavors in the end.

4.0,"An experiment from one of my favorite distilleries, this Port Wood Reserve has been matured first in American ex bourbon casks and then finished in Tawny port pipes from W&J Graham. 

Bottled at 46.5% a good strength for a whisky. Tawny color. 

On the nose, Coffee, Sawdust, Orange, Coffee beans, Burnt cake crest. 
The higher coffee note i have ever picked in a whisky ever.  Tiramisú, even the cream of it. After first sip it goes powerfully citric.
Dark chocolate so heavy. Cocoa. Wonderfully complex on the nose but not perfect.

On the palate, Oranges, Dark chocolate, Vanilla powder, Oak, Tobacco and Ginger. A little power due to the abv.

Aftertaste is spicy. Oak spice and ginger. Some bitterness from tobacco or Dark Chocolate. 

Overall this is a good whisky, pretty interesting, it can be wonderfully paired with some dark chocolate with 70% cocoa on it. 89 over 100."
