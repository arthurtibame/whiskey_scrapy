3.0,"Front notes, taste, and feel are very promising. Very soft and velvety, but doesn't last and after finish is a little sharp for my standards. Sweet and smooth like Jameson, but Jameson smoothness lasts.

Would buy again."

1.0,"Bought this after the fight. Tastes like defeat- really a very basic drink. Not that good in my opinion. Disappointed but i can see that fans may want a bottle. Its really a very ordinary whiskey. Id say a solid 2 out of ten, and thats being genuinely impartial."
1.0,"I really wanted to like this product from the get-go, I really did. I imagined the palette of the man's man and a great fighting machismo would lend itself to very full bodied, flavoursome and characteristic drink. No. A very,  basic whiskey that gives nothing noteworthy after the link to a great fighter and celebrity - Conor McGregor. Lacking in character and a flimsy, boozey surfectant of weak apple, vanilla and rubbing alcohol it serves it best purpose (if that) 3 shots in a short glass of coke. Dont even bother drinking it neat, Whiskey disappointment is not something to savour. It's at the bottom end of a bottom shelf product. The branding is boring and woeful- an overall forgettable experience for even the least experienced Whiskey drinker."

0.0,"Absolutely awful. Barely any flavour and no complexity. Only useful for making soft drinks alcoholic. Also not a ""traditional Irish Whiskey"" as claimed, a traditional Irish Whiskey is a single pot still with only malted and unmalted barley, not a cheap grain blended whiskey"

1.0,"Some context: I am a long-time mma fan, as well as a McGregor fan. But I don't let my appreciation for the sport cloud my judgment. I wanted this to be good. I knew many whiskey snobs would likely go out of their way to pan Proper No. 12 just for spite. I wanted to be able to defend this as a completely decent Irish whiskey. But this is not good. Furthermore, it is bad. I tasted it first neat, then, having regretted that with all my soul, with some ice. It didn't improve. My biggest problem is that the foremost flavor profile is that of cheap grain alcohol. It overshadows anything else it might have going for it. I'll use this as a mixer with Coke, then will never buy it again."

1.5,"I’m one of those that don’t really follow individuals in sports, just teams in general ( being NJ born and raised, I feel I must align myself to the woeful Jets, Knicks , and once shiny Giants ).  Being a Michigan and Purdue alum, Go Wolverines and Boilermakers! I actually had no idea who Connor Gregor is; gotta say I’m just not a follower of whatever fighting sport he does.  But what I do know is that if I’m a multi-million dollar prize fighter, I’d want my drink endorsement to be as solid as my punch.  And this piss pour dram is a not that.  But then again, when I think of powerful whiskies, the likes of Lagavulin, Ardbeg, Yamazaki, Laphroaig, and Amrut come to mind.  Those obviously don’t need the celebrity endorsements.  So, I had a small pour if this over Thanksgiving, with a emphasis on “small” since I purposely kept room in my thirst rather saved for an Old Forester Birthday bourbon.  A mild nose of straw, some green apples.  Taste: more of the green apples.  A bit tepid.  Gentle finish...was expecting a hotter knockout given the endorsement pedigree.  Maybe the appropriate endorsement would’ve been some boy band, not a prize fighter.  Take a hard pass."

3.5,"Look: Burnt orange on the edges, more of a mellow gold color elsewhere. Somewhat darker than I’d expect, Alving and alcohol legs when moving the whisky around the glass.

Nose: Alcohol on the nose, sweeter bready aromas, some slighter floral and grass notes as well. Agitating the whisky doesn’t really change the flavor profile. 

Palate: Slight oak, vanilla, pear and bread. Pretty decent taste, not overly flavorful though. 

Finish: clean, little to no burn, very short flavor on the finish of the sweet vanilla.

Overall: I didn’t know what to expect going into this, but Prop 12 is a decent budget Irish whisky. Maybe not something I’d reach for often, but tasty nonetheless"

3.0,"In Mixed Martial Arts there is no one bigger as far as name recognition as Connor McGregor. Whether you love him or hate him, McGregor has a persona that is undeniably entertaining. Bold, brash, abrasive, flashy, and unappologetically in your face. Couple that with the fact that McGregor has been to every continent where whiskey is distilled and has the income to try some of the best whiskeys in the world, many people wanted it to be something exceptional and unique to match his character.
What you have in Proper No. Twelve is something that is light, sweet, smooth, and approachable. It’s a blend of 3 year old malted barley and grain whiskey, likely from Bushmills as it claims to be from the “oldest” distillery. Nose, palate, and finish is full of pear, apple, honey, vanilla, and corn syrup sweetness. It is extremely easy to drink neat or on the rocks if you are new to drinking whiskey, and affordable enough to mix into cocktails.
While Proper Twelve is not anything approaching McGregor’s personality, I’ve talked to a few people who have never drank whiskey before that told me they’ve tried it and enjoyed it.
Although regular whiskey drinkers may find it simply average, majority of Connor’s fans are probably not regular whiskey drinkers and Proper Twelve reflects that. Connor McGregor is a brilliant businessman and the fact the he released a gateway whiskey that appeals to majority of his fans confirms that. Personally, I would love to see something that is representative of his persona...”The Notorious” on the label of such whiskey might be too obvious but a brilliant move nonetheless."

Nose: Sweet cereal notes with floral background scents.  Some vanilla and honey.

Flavor: VERY sweet.  I mean like cloyingly ""hurts your teeth"" sweet.  I am assuming this comes from the aging in bourbon barrels but I'm missing the characteristics I expect with an Irish whiskey.  Just sweet on sweet with a tiny background floral note.  There is just no character or anything interesting going on.  

Finish: this finishes as soon as it's begun.  Nothing going on in the finish at all other than a little alcohol burn.

So I can't say this is a bad whiskey because it's not.  It just isn't good in any way either.  It has no character or interesting flavors.  This is ""frat boy cola mixing whiskey"" and that's ok.  We need whiskeys for that because a lot of folks like whiskey and coke.  Let them purchase this (and not stray in to my harder to find stuff) and I'll stick with my complex barrel strength selections and we can each stay in our respective lanes."

3.5,"Out of the UFC octagon and into the distillery, the (in)famous Connor McGregor brings us his latest investment, an Irish Whiskey called ""Proper Twelve"". 

It was actually going to be called ""The Notorious"", since that is Connor's nickname as a fighter, but due to some intelectual property issues he couldn't get the name for his label. 

In most press releases, McGregor has declared that ""he wants to beat Jameson"", and my first intention with this review is to find out if this young dram can do it or not.

Bottled at 40%abv, burnished gold color.

On the nose, mostly grain whiskey notes appear. Prunes, Vanilla dry cake; Chocolate dry cake, very very Yeasty; 
Dry brown grass; There is an alcohol note that is not bothering anyone. After the first sip the vanilla grows stronger and more yeast appear along with and uncooked rice  note. 

On the palate, it is not harsh at all. It is creamy, Pepperu and mostly Yeasty.
Cereal, Vanilla and Acid prunes.

Aftertaste is short and uninteresting; grassy, oily and a little spicy. 

Overall, this is a very easy drinkable whiskey, for $30 is actually not a bad dram. I believe Jameson (the core expression) is not only cheaper but also better, but i see that Connor Mcgregor is really trying to compete with it. I have read reviews where people destroy this dram, but for me it is not bad at all. It is just simple and grainy. My score for it is 68 over 100."

Boy do I regret that decision.  This whiksey tastes like what I imagine an alcoholic Dr.Pepper with a few melted ice cubes would taste like.  Oddly musty, a little bit fruity but mostly without character or real defnition.  On the plus side, if you used this as a mixing whiskey, you could skip the ice since its already so watered down.  Tastes like the kind of whiskey you shoot at a bar all night long only to end up sucker punching an elderly man at the bar because he refused to drink with you.
