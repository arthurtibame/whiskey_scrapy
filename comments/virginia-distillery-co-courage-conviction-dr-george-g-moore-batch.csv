3.5,Strong Citrus notes followed by Barrel spice and vanilla.
3.5,"Aroma is warm and pleasantly fruity and buttery as it swims out of the glass; Palate is delicate without being wimpy and pulls the same malt-based, fruity and sweet notes from the aroma but expanded and richer; Finish starts sweet and ends up oaky. This is a decent whisky, I’m enjoying it."

4.0,"The whisky:

This is the most scotch-like of the half-dozen American Single Malts that I've tried.  It reminds me of a youngish, sherried Higland malt.  VA Distillery Co.'s tasting notes are quite accurate. I picked up creme brulee on the nose and red currants, dark cherry/plum, and cinnamon on the palate.  There are cream and butterscotch notes that balance the fruit well.

The palate is more sherried than red wine-influeneced.  Since the wine casks were shaved and toasted, the red wine influence may have largely been lost, meaning the cuvee casks contribute more wood spice and cocoa than wine.  There's very little smoke to detect, but a nice body gives it substance.

This is a whisky that unfolds over time.  The tasting notes don't change in type as you drink, but they trade places in intensity and the fruit and spice build nicely as you work your way through the glass.  My opinion steadily improved over the course of my first glass and I liked it more the second and third time I tried it.

Recommendation:

I got this bottle for $75.  If that seems like a reasonable price for you to try a new whisky, then I recommend this.  If that feels like a stretch or a special-occasion price, you might be better off getting something like Glenmorangie Lasanta or Aberlour 12 for a little less money.

Personally, I was happy to buy this whisky because it's a sophisticated American Single Malt and, if it seems a little pricey, then the premium you pay helps cover the distiller's R&D (and all that wood they had to buy).  VA Distillery Co. also gets points for answering pretty much any question you could have about this whisky on their website."
