3.0,"Never seen such a transparent scotch. Strong smoke aroma. Definitely an Islay. Really strong punch on the front end, but a short finish."

3.5,"Scotland, September 2017. Whisky #4

Nose: Strong clean barley malt, cider vinegar, fresh oak (virgin?), mild smoke.

Palate: Smoky, oily citrus. A little astringent with some burn if undiluted.

Finish: Fairly long with ashy smoke and licorice.

Water opens up the nose and unleashes the smoke and some waxy peat. The palate is tamed and some sweetness appears.

  Overall a brisk up-front whisky that lets you know exactly what it's about from the first sniff. For me Kilchoman expressions have yet to achieve the balance and depth of the older established Islay whiskies but they are well very made and always interesting. I do prefer their smoky whiskies, however.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"

1.75,"Nose - I keep getting burned nosing this. It's acidic, has some candy cigarette notes, light earthy notes, touch of vinegar, and a touch of oak. 

Taste - so here I get oak, I get liquid cane sugar, caramel, and watery notes. Then the whisky turns peated and you get meats and smoke. Waxy paper notes and smoke. 

This is pretty below average stuff. Overly hot. Boring flavors for sure. Still there's quality. Lets got with a 1.75. I respect the complexity despite it not being a good thing here yet."

3.5,"Nose: smokey, some citrus. Palate bitter start then big peppery spice and some sweetness for long finish.
3.5 due to price, otherwise it would be 3.75."

3.75,"Less oakey then expected, lilely due to its young age. Some sweet caramel notes on the palate and a peaty finish with a hint of charcoal"
3.75,First impression is subtle peat / smoke and nice vanilla undertones....smooth and not overly complex but very enjoyable.

4.0,Solid. Deep flavours with some creaminess to match the peat.
