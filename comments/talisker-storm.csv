4.0,"Review transfer from Barreled from October 2016

I am doing another side by side review. This time I have Talisker Storm and Dark Storm (previously reviewed). 
Both of these NAS whiskies are bottles at the standard Talisker strength of 45.8% ABV.

The first thing that jumps out is the difference in color. The storm is a golden straw while the dark storm is dark amber. Darker than the heavily colored JWB 12, but I think it is natural color from the heavily charred casks. I don it know if the Storm is natural color but if it has colorant added it is very little. 

Nose for the Storm is initially heavy cereal malt with smoke. Once it sits a couple minutes the youth of this whisky really becomes apparent. There is abundant oak but the best way I can describe it is green oak or wet oak. Not sure I can  elaborate on that other than it's young.  Signature Talisker pepper. There is vanilla, light peat smoke, and maybe a hint of honey. I picked up a touch of cacao or dark chocolate but it didn't stick around very long. Oddly enough, I got a distinct smell of a garage. I've worked at a Belle Tire and my dad has been a mechanic for 40 years so I've been around them all my life and that's what smelled. In no way was this unpleasant and it disappeared after it sat in the glass, but it was very interesting. 
The Dark Storm also showed its youth, but it was very different. Heavier on the pepper and oak. The heavy char of the casks gives a sense of overdone/burnt BBQ chicken. Quite nice. 

The palate of the Storm is smokey sweet and warming but not hot. It's medium bodied. More of the pepper and oak. Light salty/maritime character. The finish is medium length. 
The Dark Storm is spicier and saltier. More of that BBQ quality.  The oak is harder to detect due to the heavier pepper influence but it is there. Med-full body. The finish is longer than the Storm. 

Hard to say which one I prefer. It would depend on what kind of mood I'm in.  The Dark Storm is more intense but the Storm has more subtle details. Both are very good, however I think I would take the standard 10 YO over both as it is more well balanced. I gave the Dark Storm a 4.25 and that is exactly what I am giving Storm."

5.0,"It's the scotch equivalent of swimming in the sea for a couple minutes longer than you ought to because the lightning in the distance is now MUCH closer than you thought it was. It's saltwater, brine, slight iodine, light smoke, some sweetness, some heat, some malt... It's incredible. If you close your eyes and envision standing on a cliff overlooking jagged rocks being washed-over by the ocean right on the bleeding edge of Scotland while sipping this you might swear you were actually there. For some crazy reason (I'm not complaining) several stores in the Twin Cities sell Storm for $30 or less a 750mL. This and Weller 12 (if you can find it at suggested retail), for the money, are probably the best two values in whiskey, period."

1.0,This has to be one of the worst things I have ever had in my life. Imagine briny saltwater mixed with soggy campfire and burnt tires.
4.0,"Original review from Sept 2016 (transferred from Barreled):

Once again, I have the pleasure of doing an interesting side by side comparison.  Tonight it's Talisker's Storm and Dark Storm.  I'd like to thank @Generously_Paul for helping make this possible. 

Sitting both side by side the Storm is clearly the lighter of the two.  It's still a rich golden color that reminds me of apple juice.  The Dark Storm earns its namesake as it's a deeper copper like that of a slightly worn penny.  (Obviously the effect of the heavily charred casks used).  Both leave nice, silky long legs down the glass after a bit of a hearty swirl.  If I'm reading it correctly both come in at exactly the same 91.6 proof. 

On the nose the Storm gets a bit of a nod because you can clearly smell fresh apples and pears mingling with the peat smoke and light sea salt.  The Dark Storm kind of leaves the fruit in the basket and comes across as more of an Islay-style smoky scotch with some caramel or toffee sweetness.  They both smell fantastic I must say.  Different, but nice.

On the tongue is where I guess I hoped they would show some sort of lineage connection.  I knew the peat smoke was there but I want to see these guys show me they are kindred spirits (ha, a pun).

The Storm lets loose all the oak barrel characteristics claimed on the label:  lively pepper spice, some vanilla and that subtle fruitiness I noticed from the nosing.  The smoke blankets your tongue after the finish and hangs out to keep you warm.  What a nice dram.  

The Dark Storm is totally predictable, but not in a bad way whatsoever.  Silky smooth peat smoke filling your entire mouth and washing away with a thicker, oily essence that identifies with an ominous storm rolling in from off the ocean.  An excellent dram on its own.

In closing, I think the name Storm doesn't necessarily apply.  I don't imagine fruit and lively oak spice when I think of a storm, but Dark Storm is definitely aptly named.  For the first time, I can't say I prefer one over the other.  They both offer a distinctly different experience and I could be perfectly happy settling into a hammock by the beach, sipping either one waiting for said storm to roll in.

Four stars for each, both based on different experiences.  In this side by side battle the clear winner was me.  I believe they both run somewhere north of $70 a piece and if you have to choose one then you're still missing out.  Save up and snag them both when you can.  Cheers, my friends."

4.0,I’m probably at a 3.5 for this. I like a lot of the NAS Laphroaigs. They have something that Talisker 10 has that this does not. I think it’s the finish but it could be the mouth coating. Something at the end left me a little...unfulfilled? Still very good and at $30 a bottle a steal

4.5,"Grabbed Talisker Storm last March as it was on sale for 30 some dollars. Not being familiar with scotch at the time, I wasn’t in love with this whisky; however, I’ve acquired a taste for scotch, so let’s give it a go.

Look: quite light, Talisker Storm is a non age stated whisky, and the color reflects this. A nice straw color shows the likely younger scotch that was added.

Nose: I get salt water, bacon, iodine, slight honey. Really, there’s a lot going on 

Taste: initially, I get fruit and honey, followed by spice, salt water, and campfire on the finish 

Finish: a rye spice, guessing this is aged in ex bourbon barrels, kicks in near the end and helps gives way to some heat. Slight bitterness, and a lingering campfire flavor lasts to the end 

Overall: I love Talisker Storm as I find it quite complex, and taste something new with every dram. While I’ve never had any other Talisker, Storm is worth a purchase if you can find a sale."

Honestly, it's just as good, maybe even better than what I remember? The nose is sugar sweet and smokey. I get more smoke, salt, iodine, honey sweetness, pepper, and a slight vanilla flavor as well. The finish brings some chili pepper to the party, not too spicy but its definitely reminiscent of that flavor. The salt and smoke stick with you for a while. It's going to be very difficult to not keep drinking this."

4.0,Full bodied and peaty but no overwhelmingly so.
3.75,"Talisker Storm is a scotch I have tried a few times in bars and liked, but never enough to shell for the full bottle.  I did receive a sample as a gift and so this tasting was more leisurely.

It welcomes you with light smoke and smells of orange rind, dillisk, lawnmower engine and Atlantic spray. The hospitality continues with tastes of tears, soft smoky peat, oak, spicy pepper, and some honey sweetness. At the end, a salted, peppered oak ushers you gently on your way.

A very enjoyable island scotch, but overall not as good as the 10 year old or the Skye in my opinion. Probably 3.75 stars. Next up on my backlog from Talisker is a sample of the 18 year old, for which I have high hopes."

Peat immediately then citrus on nose. Slightly Briny but not prominent in the mouth. Fruits like pear also appear. 

Nice finish, not feeling as spicy as noted but definitely dry.

Love the peat on finish. Smoky but not a bomb like Ardbeg. Reminds me of Benromach Organic/Wood but significantly more peat forward.

Priced at about $35. Good buy if you don't want to spend more on Lagavulin 8 or other full bodied Islay's. Great intro to classic Peated Scotch for the price."

2.75,"I have to agree with the professional review of this whiskey. The name is quite disappointing to how the whiskey actually tastes. It’s more of a rounded off mild peated Scotch than the “storm” suggests. It does not punch you in the face with flavor at all. 

Nose: smoke and brine dominate. The peat sent is muted. Very malty and honeyed on the finish. Not much fruit but I feel like there might be a hint of either apples or a grapefruit of some kind.

Taste: Very Briney. Followed closely by the smoke and peat. Peat shows up much more on the taste. Finishes mid pallet is straight classic scotch maltiness. Very reminiscent of a run of the mill highland. Finish is oaky and mixed with flavors of black pepper, red pepper flakes and cayenne peppers. 

All and all not bad, but I wish the smoke and peat was bumped up a bit."

3.5,"For this week's edition of the tasting Tuesday malt we find ourselves with a rather polarizing malt. I've had my eye on this bottle ever since it saw a massive price drop on market ($85 down to $49). Whenever I solicited the opinion of the Distiller community it was always met with lukewarm reviews. Recently it for yet another price drop to $44 and I just decided what the heck, cause after all isn't the saying there is no such thing as a bad Talisker? 
So having spent sometime with the bottle I have to admit that whilst I was never taken by it, I did find it appealing. This is very similar to how I felt about the Oban 14 (granted they are very different profiles) didn't love it, but enjoyed drinking it. So let's jump into the tasting notes:
Upon entry it's pretty rich with a burst of smoke and brine that quickly receedes to reveal honey, toffee and a berry jam note. We then get hit with a spice swell that isn't something I am used to with Scotch, not quite a Rye spice but not far off. We then get a medium finish with less intense smoke, smoked almonds and again the spice notes. 
This really is a pleasant pour. For the $44 I paid I have no complaints. I think if you remove the Talisker name and just rate it on experience it's hard to argue with the product. Is it as good as the Talisker 10? F#$& no! HaHa. Is it a good buy for $50 or less? Absolutely! 
Cheers all!"

Poured neat, nose has campfire smoke layered with honeyed malt, salted caramel, dusty cardboard and faint olive note. Not as peat strong as the big Islay entrants, instead sweet and inviting. Creamy mouthfeel leads palate of salty smoked honey, malty caramel, clotted cream with black pepper and wood. Flavors aren't overly robust but still delicious. This does have a silky buttery softness to it like Redbreast pot still Irish. Finish is long with lasting smoky malt, raw honey, pepper and salty wood. This is highly enjoyable and approachable smoky scotch. Well balanced and easy drinking with smooth taste that only improves once opened. With pricing coming down its a no brainer to purchase ........94/100......wonderfull salty, sweet and smoky scotch!"

1.0,"I first had this whisky at a bar, and it was bad.  It was Talisker with a soapy taste.  Perhaps the bartender wasn’t rinsing the glasses properly, I thought.  There was no reason for me to buy an NAS Talisker that is the same price as the 10 year old Talisker, which is probably my go-back-to-whisky of all time.

And then I got gifted a bottle of Talisker Storm.  Popped it open.  It wasn’t terrible.  It’s definitely sharper than Talisker 10, replacing some wonderful spiciness with just chemical harshness.  But it’s got that nice iodine, maritime peat and citrus that’s in Talisker’s DNA.  But, gradually, the palate went off.  It might be the soapiness I found at the bar, but having a full bottle to try and characterize what is nasty about it, I am finding more of a metallic chemical Brillo pad note that is in Johnny Walker Red.  It took about 4 months and 60% of the bottle to finish before this offputting taste emerged, but when it did, this shit could only go into cocktails or be mixed with ice.

Even when I put this in blind line ups, this gets beat by Isle of Skye 8 years every time, and is utterly trounced by Talisker 10.  Ultimately, this is just a forgettable whisky, but I almost want to give it a negative score.  It’s not quite that bad.  It would take a whisky that I would not drink for free even if I felt like drinking, and nothing else was available to deserve a negative score, and this just barely is not that bad.

Score: 0 (forgettable)
How much does a bottle cost: $45-65

3.75,"Smoky, peaty, peppery nose, with a creamy, salty/sweet mouthfeel."
3.5,"Nose: Mildly briny smoke (more like fruity wood smoke than peat-reek), some citrus peel, a slight mineral iodine note (eliciting sea breezes), some mossy peat, a hint of honey. [The dry glass is mild ashy smoke with a sweet profile].

Palate: Sweet and spicy arrival, opening into a smoky development with lots of citrus fruits and capsicum. There's a little black pepper but it's restrained in comparison to other Talisker expressions and the sweet character returns on the late palate. The texture is fairly neutral.

Finish: Medium/short. Ashy smoke and some brine on the aftertaste.

This is well named as there is a definite maritime quality to this malt, with the nose convincingly conveying the impression of a brisk sea breeze before a tempest.  However the eponymous storm loses it's force before landfall and is not the expected blustery sou'wester, crashing on the Atlantic rocks of Skye. This is more a light squall - a little threatening at sea, but romantic and cosy if on shore.  It certainly doesn't rattle the windows of the bothy like the Dark Storm expression, or blow them off the hinges like the 57 Degrees North.

Adding a dash of water does this dram no harm at all. The nose coalesces and broadens while the palate picks up some sweet notes and mutes its spice. This is maybe not what a confirmed Talisker-head would like, but I'd commend it to beginners. It's a pleasant and most acceptable whisky crafted to appeal to landlubbers.  In fact if properly watered this would be an admirable first ""smoky"" dram.

The official comments here are pretty much on the money, but I don't think it's worth 88/100. It's an appealing whisky but not earth shattering - in Australia for about $5 more you can buy Talisker 10, which is real whisky with balls.

There is also, if you taste it dispassionately, more than a passing similarity to certain blended scotches, and I have to confess that now I'm a quarter of the way through the bottle I've given up on tasting it neat or with water, and instead I've been using it up as a mixer instead of my usual bottom-shelf blend. It's great in this role but I guess that's damning with faint praise.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"

3.75,"N - Brine and Pear

T - salt water taffy, charred wood with hints of cherry

F - same earthy peat that I love from the 10 with light pepper

I think for the price point this is a solid whisky. As I’ve seen others say it’s not as nuanced as the 10 but that’s ok. I enjoy the brininess of this expression. The charred barrels give me a small bit of cherry hidden in there. The Talisker style peat is very comforting and that rings true here too."

3.0,"As a huge Islay lover....Not a fan. Smoke and then some salt are immediately present, followed by some honey and grass. There never seems to be a moment that jumps out and grabs with a distinguished taste. It's mellow the whole way through in a boring way, not a balanced way. The lack of complexity screams young whisky masked with charred barrels and heavy, smoked peat. If I'm having smoke, I want Ardbeg or Lagavulin where I can taste the earth. If I want salt I want Old Pulteney or Bruichladdich where I can taste the sea or salted barely. If I want a mix I'll sip a Campletown offering. This just hits with peat smoke and rolls away into nothing. Let down."

4.25,I may be controversial but it is even better than the ten. It’s less smoky and prayed than the ten but I would describe the taste as ‘maritime’ - less ‘heavy’ and more briny than 10. Very good value for price!

Taste has strong black pepper over dank seaside, hints of ash and smoke on the back end into the finish.  Lite stone fruit comes on late as well.  Somewhat out of balance, and something damp and dark here that takes away from the great Talisker seaside character.  Shame.  1/7/20"

3.25,"A not very heavy golden yellow slips into the glass, bold of its coloring and tending not to let us know what aging is inside (they say to vary from 8 to 25 years).
On the nose the thing that immediately catches the attention is the peaty aspect, in its not being as intense as one would expect: the renewed barrels used for aging were burned again before use, just to give the toasted boost to the malt, but on the nose you find instead a light turbidity, almost in the background. Marine and sweet notes excel (alas!), with yellow fruit and butter biscuits. Unusually kind, perhaps the calm before the storm? Not exactly.
On the palate alcohol is very present but not excessive, and the buttery aspect of the whisky remains decisively. The turbidity is there but far from being imposing, almost timid, the sweeter and pimp aspects prevail: still fruit, with a citrus note, pepper (Talisker, here it is!), again biscuits, malt (not so old) and seafaring, which acts as a glue to everything. I also perceive a little wood, non-invasive.
In the finish, pepper and the marine aspect prevail, peat always just barely present, as if it were more a suggestion than a real perception, all for a not very long time."

5.0,"If i had to pick two whisky brands as the most impressive, solid, great in every bottle, i would definitively pick Dalmore and Talisker. 

Talisker storm is by far, the best Talisker i have ever tasted (and i have had the 10yo, the skye and the dark storm). 

As soon as it hits your tongue you know you have found everything you will ever need in your life again. 

Bottled at 45.8%abv, with an old gold color. 

On the nose, the typical Talisker from the Island of Skye. PEAT IS THE NAME OF THE GAME. That talisker signature peatyness takes control, letting you have a little bit of salt, gas water, pepper and Burnt meat.

On the palate is simply one of the greatest whiskies i have ever had. Sweet and Salty, starts with toffee or caramel to change into a peppery peaty flavor. The finish is eternal with a solid note of RUBBER. Yeah, rubber or leather. Incredible.

Overall i give this monster of dram a 99 over 100 (nose lost 1 point), and for the price of 45 dollars, you should go get it RIGHT ABOUT NOW. SLAINTÈ!!!"

But it sure is delicious.  The peat is about a 5 on a scale of 0 to Islay.  The stone fruit of the islands comes through with some beautifully light and friendly peppery notes with a hint of butterscotch.  I highly recommend this above any other Taliskers.  I am sad, though because when I got this in Nashville it costed 40$.  But, now that I've moved I can't find it for anywhere near that price.  Same thing with the Laphroaig 10.

The first sip is burnt campfire logs the morning after. The burn is not insignificant but pairs nicely with the fiery flavor. It's dry and morphs into a charcoal-like darkness; burnt cookie bottoms. Some melted plastics. The peat comes through as medicinal rather than muddy.

The finish is barrel char: tannins and some sherry-like flavors. Cigar box and tobacco; dry and burning the front or the tongue like a lit cigar. Motor oil. There is some kind of plum/dark fruit business at the end. This is a very solid and affordable peat-forward Scotch, good at the right price."
