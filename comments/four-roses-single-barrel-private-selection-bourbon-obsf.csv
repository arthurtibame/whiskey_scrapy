4.75,Strong minty. Incredible bourbon
4.0,"Age:9 years, 3 months. 
ABV: 58.7

My dad picked this up for me on a trip to Wisconsin last summer. Dipped neat (Well, of course).
Nose: floral, vanilla, caramel..a bit of granny Smith green apple. 
Palate: follows the nose. Really floral. Not as viscous as I had hoped. 
Finish: medium length. Nothing surprising. 
In the end, this was pretty solid. I still have not had a 4R that's blown me away. Am I just a Turkey freak who prefers that flavor profile? Perhaps. I enjoy these store picks, but the 4R picks don't even come close to good RRpicks imo."
4.5,"Not sure if this is the exact bottle.  I'm sipping a sample sent to me by Jake Gregory from the Slurred Speach blog over at Bourbon Sippers.  His notes indicate 122 proof, OBSV, ""Borrowed Brass"" .  I'm tasting this neat in a Glencairn after about 15 minutes rest.

Just a beautiful polished mahogany coloring.  Viscous sheeting and slow legs promise a rich mouthfeel.  

The nose is rich and subtle, with surprisingly little alcohol considering the proof.  Ripe peach and carmelized sugar are my first impressions.

Rich caramel and notes of black pepper and Red Hots candy jump out on the taste buds.  There is a lot of barrel in the mid pallete.  Oak and char, dry vanilla and cherries make up the body of the flavor profile.  The finish is long, beautifully tapering to notes of menthol, a little pine resin and finally a slow, lingering capsacin-like warmth in the back of the throat and through the chest.  

There is just the slightest funkiness late in the taste curve that I can't quite identify.  It might be one of those nights... but theres just the slightest bit of imbalance that keeps this from hitting a perfect 5 on my scale.  The world has a lot of outstanding 4's, a lot less 4.5's and damned few over that.  This is right there - truly superb.  Wish I could get another!"
