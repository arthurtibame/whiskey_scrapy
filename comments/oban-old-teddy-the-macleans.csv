4.5,Vanilla and brown sugar on the nose. Light fruit and berries on the palate.
5.0,"A young and bratty 14 year taken early, the smoke is very dominant on the taste in a good way and you don’t acclimate to it, with a buttery biscuit smoothness. Banana, citrus and apples dominate the nose which quickly more into a Smokey finish. Oban mastery."
5.0,"Simply one of the best single malts money can buy.  I regret not bringing home a few bottles from our last visit to the distillery.
Indescribably smooth and complex, with just the right amount of richness and sweetness to be the perfect after dinner dram."
