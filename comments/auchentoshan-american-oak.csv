null,Enjoy the scotch. I would say it is a bit more oily than the profile suggests. I think if it was aged longer it may have more of a lingering taste. As it is the taste is gone within a minute.

4.0,"An improved Auchie starter scotch. Received my bottle as a Christmas gift. Smooth vanilla cream nose with similar taste with hints of coconut and lemony apricot. The finish offers a sugary peach sensation with a mild, welcome spice. I recommend this if you're a scotch lover wanting to delve into bourbon or vice-versa."

3.0,"I sometimes wonder about the professional reviews I read.  This professional reviews says it has coconuts tastes.  Damned if my palet can taste it.

The write up says it was aged in used Bourbon Barrels...  I can't really taste that influence.  I suspect the barrels had a light char and were used less than six years.

In summary it's a somewhat expensive entry level scotch."

3.0,"It's time to kick off the third wave of samples from our Scotch trade team.  This one was supplied by my friend Ryan, and it continues the theme he established back in the very beginning:  scotch that is similar to bourbon.  This one strays a bit from that line, but the heavy vanilla and oak notes fall right in line.

The smell is very inviting- soothing vanilla, lots of soft floral notes and a hint of herbal citrus.  The taste is very oaky.  Lots and lots of oak.  Not too harsh.  There is the typical lowland-style delicacy in place here, though.  

The palate is very lightly charred oak spice with just the right amount of cinnamon and heat.  It's delightfully smooth through the entire sip, while the finish is pretty short.

It's solid.  It's light.  It's ridiculously drinkable.  It's a great pre-dinner dram on a warm, late summer evening.  I'd even enjoy this one as a kick starter to a tasting event.  Thanks, Ryan.  3.5 stars.  Cheers."

Much sweeter than the three wood."
2.0,null
3.0,"The nose is tart and unremarkable (even in a glencairn and after a great deal of patience), with surface-level hints of unripe berries and young spirit. The palate is more rambunctious, angsty even: sharp vanilla, perfumed and floral, with underwhelming flavors of rock candy and fruit overpowered by heavy menthol and barrel spice. The mouthfeel is waxy and the aftertaste is that of cherry chapstick. Seedbread comes along after the pleasant raspberry zing finish that happens to accompany that spicy palate. I see some nice Lowland characteristics at play, but only clumsily — not as in the sure simplicity of a Glenkinchie. Overall one of the least luxurious scotch experiences I've had. Maybe the bottle that Kory got was an anomaly."

2.0,"Going by the description, on the box, I expected something really good from this juice.  On the nose I could smell...a little sweetness, but not much else.  On the palate, the main flavor was wood (not a bad thing) and a slight fruity sweetness...but not much.  The whole experience felt ""muted"" like there was some filter blocking the smells and flavors from coming through.  This was so mild, it was almost flavorless. 
  
  The spirit does not need water, it just dilutes it more.  It does benefit with a little rest time in the glass, but not a lot.  Very bland, nothing unique.  I will not buy this one again."

4.0,"Visual:  In the glass it is a medium amber color/gold color. Medium, lasting legs after a swirl.

Nose:  Floral, and a mite tart, with hints of vanilla and toffee, as well as lemon zest and orange peel. Light and crisp.

Palate: More citrus zest appears on the palate, along with some sweetness and vanilla. It is light and thin, which might be owing to many factors, including the mild 40% ABV, the lack of maturity (I’m guessing), and the lowland triple distillation process. 

Finish:  The finish is short, with a bittersweet dark chocolate note and some barrel char. 

Empty glass:  Little to report.

This is a smooth and drinkable whisky. A great beginner’s scotch, or scotch intro for bourbon drinkers. It lacks challenge and complexity, but is nice and inoffensive. It would be a 3-1/2 star dram at a higher price point. At less than $40 USD, I’m bumping it to 4 stars."

The nose hits all the right notes , but not necessarily what you expect from American oak. Sure there's vanilla and the ever so faint touch of wood, but lemon and apple are also both present, making this fruity rather than floral.  In these respects it could almost pass for a distant cousin of Jack Daniels. The palate is pleasant and quite smooth, though also flat and a little weak. The finish... It just isn't there. All in all a nice dram, especially for a novice."

Nosing this is really a pleasant experience, because I can already tell things to come will be balanced. Faint light citrus, a good dose of vanilla wafers, and spice. The palate is not too delicate, but sweet. A nice mouth-feel, medium coat, with buttery goodness, oak, and peach cobbler with french vanilla ice cream. Hell yes. The finish is medium, but I am far from bitching about that. This one is ""Peaceful Easy Feeling"" by the Eagles. Get some! 3.75. Thanks for the sample Ryan!"

Light and creamy, but you can tell its youth by that certain bite on the palette and finish.  Even though it's triple distilled, it's very unlike its Irish cousins across the sea.  Really good as an intro whisky to the white wine drinker.  I'm curious to try this distillery at the older ages like 18'or 21.  Wondering if more of the creamy fruity character comes out then?"

3.0,"Stop number 33 on the Scottish Distillery Tour is Auchentoshan. This is my first scotch from the Lowland region so I had a certain level of anticipation and excitement headed into this review. This single malt is bottled at 40% ABV, has colorant added making it a golden straw color, and it is chill filtered. 

The nose is young and lively. Full of underripe pears, green oak and toasted coconut. Malty, barley sugar sweetness, vanilla, toffee and light cinnamon. It's grassy, like a mix of fresh green grass and dry brown grass. Some creamy citrus notes, like lemon cheesecake and a little grapefruit. This really reminds me of an unpeated version of the Bowmore Gold Reef. There is a touch of green apples and honey. A little mint and anise in the background. There are some bourbony notes. It I find them to be quite muted. 

Vibrant and fresh on the palate. Coconut, vanilla cream. Pears and honey, cinnamon, toffee and nutmeg. More green oak. Pepper, not much but more than I expected. Definitely a young whisky and it shows. 

Light to medium bodied and on the thin side. 
The finish is medium length, dry, oaky and a tad green. 

There is much more personality here than I expected but I believe that to be due to its youth. The fact that it's triple distilled reinforces that belief. I would love to try the 21 year old to see what a properly matured Lowland whisky has to offer. This is a good scotch, but it's immature to a fault. I'm not sold on Auchentoshan, but neither am I condemning them based on this one sample. Speaking of which, thank you to Ryan (Lee) for providing this sample. 3.25 seems accurate, especially for the low price of $35. 
Cheers"

3.0,"Had some business out of town, so I grabbed a few samples to work my way through.  Sadly, I only got to sample this one (the other nights were sampling with workmates at larger volumes...)

The nose, straight out, is fruity with banana, tangerines and coconut.  Sprinkle in notes of tea and honey, vanilla and pinch in some cinnamon.  All this is clean, crisp and creamy.

The mouthfeel is extremely thin and light, unlike the nose.  Citrus lemon, cinnamon and oak char come through, but a vanilla sugar sweetness are immediate but fades just as rapidly.  A short-lived palate and almost right to a finish.

What remains is short with vanilla, white pepper, lemon zest with a touch of oak.

This is akin to an Irish whiskey (sensible give the near proximity to Norther Ireland).  The sweetness, the fruity banana and thin body (triple distillation).  The brevity and thinness take away from it's full potential.  Increasing the ABV to 43% or better yet 46% would greatly improve this whisky.  Give this time, like one should, and the whisky-reward is improved.  The longer it sits, the more improved it gets, though, only to a certain point.  [85/100][Tasted: 12/4/17]"

For the same money, you could get an excellent bourbon or at least a Glenfiddich 12, which is not life-changing, but is at least pleasant. This is the only whisky I’ve ever poured down the drain. Luckily, I didn’t buy a bottle. My friend poured it for me on 3 separate occasions, and my reaction was the same each time. So was his. He ended up dumping the bottle. It’s really that bad."

3.0,"Another offering from the only Lowland Scotch distillery I've tried to date. On sale for $30 a bottle, this purchase was a no-brainer. 

There's a good amount going on in the nose. I get coconuts and orange initially. There's also a certain grassy note present, as well as the aroma of dried fruit. A nice nose. 

On the palate, I get more of the coconut as well as notes of tangerine and vanilla. I get a strong oak flavor, which is no doubt a product of bourbon barrel aging. The finish fades very quickly. At this point, I'm left only with the orange/tangerine note. This is probably due in part to the low ABV.

Overall, the American Oak does a fine job as a role-player in the Auchentoshan line-up. It's a solid entry level whisky and offers great value for your money. It's not all that complex, and it certainly is not a game-changer. But at its price point, it's there's nothing to complain about. I'd say this one is worth a buy for anybody seeking a budget single malt. Good stuff."

Oaky, sweet, full of vanilla and cinnamon, at first you think there’s very little finish until you realize lying in a meadow chewing on a piece of grass for 10 minutes IS the finish. I loved it."

2.0,Coconut on the nose along with something I couldn’t before describe (until I read other reviews calling it old banana). It smells like a banana cream pie my dad used to make where he would use overripe bananas. I don’t dislike it but it’s definitely odd. Palate is on the thin side and a bit hot for 80 proof. Brown banana flavor lingers on the finish with a substantial amount of oak. It’s an odd one for sure. I don’t hate it but won’t be buying another bottle. I’d say it was worth a one time $35 expenditure and will keep it around for friends to try as it is at least unique.

At $40 this is not worth an initial buy before you try it first. Unfortunately the only other bottle I can get is the Three Wood at $70. I imagine that is better. The American Oak has a subtle noise of muted oil and vanilla wood with an oily taste that immediately disappears. In fact, everything on the taste kind of disappears instantly. I don't get any real bourbon characteristics, and hardly any of the nose that is suggested by the expert reviewer. Maybe my novice self can't pick out a lot of the subtleties, but I do know I've had Scotch at this price that is much better."

Somewhat like wooden dust and grass, fermented grapes, tons of citrus zest and notes of polish there to the nose. But the aroma is not strongly marked - it is some kind of very viscid but not pronounced.
Again some polish, zest and acetone to the tongue. Sherry and spirit notes on a palate and on the edges of a tongue. After some time it gives pleasant sweetness. Not very gentle whiskey (to say it right) and not very usual. Not very complex though but weird.
Finish is again with chemical notes, some spirit, bitter citrus zest too.
So, after the first acquaintance I have to say - there are two main taste components which are vanilla sweetness and polish/zest. It remains weird to me and I did not like it much personally but something’s in it."

The flavor is nice (you definitely get the vanilla from the bourbon cask), though lighter than most whiskies.  Finishes with a lingering burn and then a faint bitterness.

Palate: An oily and slightly oaky arrival with stone-fruit notes. Some vanilla, cocoanut, chilli and more oak presence come through in the development. The texture is a little thin but there is a slight creaminess.

Finish: Short. Mildly spicy with oak tannins and a resinous sweet aftertaste.

I don't find any great resemblance to bourbon here at all - this is much more like a heavily-oaked Irish blend without the unmalted barley notes. Actually, it's pretty representative of the Auchentoshan house style in general - resinous and citric spicy. The nose improves a little when it's left to rest in the glass, but the palate never loses it's gauche youthful buzz.

Not a very exciting malt but it's inexpensive, mixes well with dry ginger ale, and is comparable to a mid-range blended scotch.

3.25,"My first lowland! Since it was basically between this and Glenkinchie, where the difference is like $50... 

The nose on this is unlike anything I've smelled in a scotch whisky; fruity yet floral, with lychee and heavily perfumed rose petals. There is a distinct whiff of banana pudding that somehow blends naturally into the rest. This just may be the prettiest smelling whisky ever. It has the gentlest entry, like a breeze, very sweet, with coconut and vanilla cream, bananas foster topped with cinnamon, stopping just short of rum-like. It finishes with just the vaguest suggestion of grassy hay and lemony tea leaves.

The novelty wears off after a while though (probably the unusual coconut note), and I ended up using the last part of the bottle to make a few ""Bobby Burns"" a.k.a. the ""Scottish Manhattan"". I can't wait to try other lowlands though, particularly Ailsa Bay, if it ever decides to release a dedicated single malt stateside - or maybe just the Three Wood of this because the pickin's are quite slim."

Bottled at 40%abv 

On the nose, i got grassy notes, plum and the purest malted barley.
