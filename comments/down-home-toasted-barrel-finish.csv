2.25,"Really happy I wasn't the one to add this. A touch sad I'll have to lower the score since a 5.0 seems comical if someone has you know drank whisky.

So full disclosure I've had the pleasure of getting some samples from the guys involved in this. I got to try their 5.5 year for free and got a sample of this while it was aging, well before it was done aging in the toasted barrel. Lets just say, I'm REALLY glad they weren't done aging the sample cause that was NOT good.  But yeah I might have been biased but this all started with my praise for their batch 2 12 year which I fell in love with. 

Nose - vanilla and over ripe banana. Now my scotch fans will be like ""omg YOUNG"" and while that's not false this one kinda works. Honestly I get a white board marker with that alcohol and sweetness note big time. As I dig in I get more cream and vanilla and just robust flavors. 

Taste - Now I get more shoe varnish, vanilla, creme, bananas, and chocolate. That said there's a funky oaky and cardboard and water oak and what not going on. This is normally a flaw in a bourbon but here it's crazy complex and unique. 

I can't lie for under 70 this is a fun whisky. Solid 2.25 and a winner imo. I mean guys 2.25 for a 65 dollar whisky and it's polarizing? Oh yeah that's one to buy and checkout."
