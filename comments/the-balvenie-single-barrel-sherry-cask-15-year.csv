5.0,"I really enjoy this. Quality with an obvious tilt to sherry. Let it sit for a while and the oak characteristics enrich and become cinnamon, spice, and vanilla. A fine dram indeed. 

If you like this, give Glendronach's Revival (15yr) or Allardice (18yr) a try."

4.0,"The nose comes up as sweet at first, more like a caramel.  The first taste is a bit spicy, and just a tad bit of smoke.  Water really opens it up it in this one; a cube of ice will do wonders.  For the price, yeah...it's expensive for a 15 yr old sherry.  You can do better for the price."

4.0,Absolutely fantastic super sweet and sticky. The only thing is the price. $150CAD puts it in territory of some seriously good other whiskies that's better like much older glendronach single casks.

Kicks a punch on the tongue, ice helps. Spicey and salty caramel tastes, very smooth and with a tingeliy burning finish.  The sherry does not stand out for me, a bit disappointing."

4.0,"Nice amber color.  Nose:  sherry, dried fruits, faint hint of citrus, toasted carmel.  With time more vanilla and honey.  Gets better with more time in glass.  Palate is medium bodied, oaky, sherries juicy fruit, hint of leather.  Finish is spicy with hint of cinnamon.  Not my favorite but pretty good."

4.0,"Even with only a few sips poured, it looks like maple syrup with a rosy red hue—one of the darkest whiskies I've seen. It actually reminds me in some ways of the Oamaruvian: winey, punchy, drying, and spicy. It differs in that it has a wonderful leather note and sports that incredible Balvenie maltiness. Truly phenomenal. I'd have bought this one if it weren't for the budget. From tasting event, 12/17/16."

5.0,Only compares to the Macallan 18 in complexity on the nose and palate. Best thing to come from Balvenie. Cant wait to open my 15 single barrel as well. Save ths one for a special occasion to highlight a memorable experience. Paid 100 worth every penny

Finish:  long, spicy, oak.  As the very long finish continues the spiciness goes away, the oak stays, and a little bit of sherry comes back.  
Overall very good.  A rich,complex, and smooth scotch."

4.0,"It's iodine, red berries, a tingling ethanol, and Sherry notes. The palate is full and smooth with more sherry and oak. The finish is dry oak, Sherry, baked tarts, and has a long lingering warmth. This is a great sherry smooth dram."
4.25,"Nose: dried fruits - plums, cherries, caramel

Palate: baking spices, hints of citrus, rich and full bodied as expected from a Sherry cask. 

A lovely dram as expected from anything Balvenie. Lookjng forward to the next tasting to expand."

Red fruit abounds in the taste, rich but not to a a syrupy texture.  Medium finish continues the red berries theme with a slight alcohol tinge to end finally overtaking the fruit"

4.0,"Nose - Strong red berry notes on a backbone of an oak aged riesling/moscato, hints of pear peels, hint of grape fruit snacks.

Taste - Nice red fruity berry sweet, caramel, sweet toasted brioche, gentle baking spice tingle, baked apples/pears.

Finish - Lingering baked pear/apple sweet, hint of crushed red berries w/ seeds adding a bit of fruity bitter.

Score - 87/100

Final Thoughts - I quite liked this one overall. Nose had a more ""dark"" feel and mouthfeel and taste seemed to match the 15 year age statement a bit better. More sherry influence throughout and no off-putting flavors.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes

Would I buy a bottle? - Yes"
3.0,"I don't know...
    
Some apricot to the nose with a touch of sulfur and flowers. The palate is anaesthesizing, with spices towards the back of the tongue - ain't no sherry happening here. The finish is fairly long, but not in the most pleasant of ways.
    
    Really not my thing."

4.25,"The color first. Wow, a beautiful, dark Amber, that bordered more on mahogany. Compared with the Caribbean Cask, the color was (quite literally) night and day. Sweet, strong nose that's fruity, and gives me a strong maple smell. The first taste is something else. The fruit comes forward, but as someone who went from Doublewood, to Caribbean Cask, to this, you can sense the alcohol from the get go. Left a tingling sensation throughout my mouth that kept it watering, and kept me thinking about it for minutes afterwards. I wanted to make this last all day. For me, it was almost a perfect sip."

4.0,Golden honey color - oily and clings to the glass with slow legs. Earthy and fruity with a bit of bite on the nose. Warm fruit and honey with a bold sherry taste. Long finish.
4.0,"I really have to assume this is the old first fill, it is certainly the darkest bottle I've seen and purchased in a shop I KNOW doesn't move scotch quickly.  

Nose - red fruits, dark caramels, and creme brulee.  

Taste - sherry BOMB.  It's figs, plums, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, toasted oak.

Finish is oak and raisins and it's slow and long lingering.  

If you can find this for 115 and it's a super dark bottle, get it.  An absolutely must drink of anyone who likes sherry at all."

3.75,"N: sherry influence is obvious on the nose with dried apricots, cranberry, curry spices, raisins, and rich nuttiness. There is also a slight mineral quality.

P: Rich fruit in spades...raisins, plums, honey, subtle oak presence, cardamom, mild spice and pepper.

F: The honey sweetness is chased by dry tart frutiness. Tangy. Hint of chili pepper.

Very good, perhaps not as rounded as other sherry barrel malts, but very tasty."

4.5,"My favorite expression from The Balvenie so far. 
Age: 15
Nose: dark cherries, caramel, honey, pomegranate. 
Palate: perfect viscosity...clings to the mouth like it clings to the glass. Hits the tongue with the dark cherry, and leaves the back of the palate with the honey and malt. Extremely pleasant experience. 
Finish: really the perfect length. Two minutes later and I can still taste the dark fruits. 
This one is so delightful. I've searched high and low for the first fill bottles...with no luck. However, I finally found a bottle that must have been aged in a barrel that still had a lot to give. Almost as dark as my gd18. I have a Balvenie Tun 1509 Batch 4 that I psyched to pop open. It has work to do to beat this one. For me personally, I take this every single day over Macallan 18."
