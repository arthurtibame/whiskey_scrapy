5.0,For the price point this one is a damn fine whiskey.  Great nose and it certainly reminds you of what a great whiskey should taste like.  I'll certainly snag a bottle as soon as I can.

5.0,My first Irish whiskey. Maybe one of the smoothest whiskeys I have ever drank. A hint of scotch flavor that fades fast into a touch of sweet bourbon flavor and fruit then a nice long smooth finish. Nice easy to drink whiskey.

4.0,"Great finish, but a really strong nose that overpowers (no pun intended). I compare it to yellow spot, which I shouldn't, but even though it's a smooth whiskey the nose is very alcoholic. Hopefully it with smooth out over the life of the bottle."

3.0,"At the Irish bar in Connecticut where I always seek out for their Fish and Chips with an ale/stout or two.  Peruse the shelf to determine what I have afterwards and Powers 12 is there and, since I never tasted, took advantage of the opportunity.

Nose is sweet honey, vanilla, banana and cereal.  A good Irish whiskey aroma.  Arrives surprisingly hot.  Wood dominates the palate.  Nutmeg, sugar, oak are all blended in a thin body.  The dram does sweeten over time (15-20 minutes) with a touch of water.  A bitter and woody finish that does last for a good length of time.

This has a lovely, sweet nose and to a great contrast, a dry oaky and spicy palate.  This feels younger than a 12 year; I was surprised somewhat by that spiciness/bite.  A teaspoon of water and patience tones the Power’s harshness down.  Maybe I prefer my Irish whiskey’s sweeter (ala Green Spot/Red Breast), but, give it time and water and you have a decent Irish dram.  [85/100][Tasted: 11/7/16 @ Vaughan’s]"

2.0,"Having really enjoyed the Gold Label, the NAS version, I was intrigued to try the older version. I am struck with a fast succession of overlapping flavours like fenil, herbs, spice, tangy bitterness, rye and leather, the flavours then drop and then reform: mint coffee, smoke and then a peppery, smooth, honeyed, finish, some oak notes and finally, a subtle, lingering taste of candy floss. Granted the finish is longer, but it tastes younger, rather discordant, with an off bitter and tangy set of flavours paired with strange, excessive sweetness. It's a bizarre mix of bourbon flavours and Irish whiskey, too styles at times close, but here seemingly on different planets that should never be destined to meet."

This is a great 12 year old whisky. It's thick, rich, fruity, and smoooth!"
4.0,"I must own this bottle for my own collection. Incredibly oily and full bodied with a huge Carmel presence. Straight out of the bottle it's spicy with some light fruit elements, but I don't find any sherry inflict within this. Over time it softens up but still retains quality. I would like to come back to this again, but the first impression is killer!"

5.0,"The original Powers Distillery was located on John's Lane just off Thomas Street - in Dublin's Liberties (where the best whiskey was invented). This whiskey matured in ex-bourbon barrels and finished off for a small amount of time in ex-sherry casks.

 Nose - Distinct cocoa and mocha overtones with hints of dried apricots, orange peel and marshmallow.
Taste - Soft and smooth. Crisp and spicy - element of bittersweet fruit, marmalade and toffee apples. Velvety texture
Finish - Chocolatey with some dusty oakiness

Best whiskety Powers has top offer. I bought on recommendation of fine bar man in Peruke & Periwig bar, Dublin, having spent a lonely afternoon there with my missus.

4.0,"Nose: Complex malty cereal aromas conjoined spectacularly with old oak and a little dark honey and leather. Dark stewed fruits of an unexpected variety - flambée pineapple, prunes, dates and banana, sprinkled with tumeric. Rich, austerely sweet, subtle and relaxing. A very good nose. [The dry-glass aroma is simple brown sugar with an oaky hint].

Palate: Sweet and luscious oily arrival against a backdrop of oak. The development brings out complex flavours that are balanced with meticulous precision. The initial sweetness settles down to a dignified semi-sweet character with vanilla, blood orange, dark chocolate, sultanas, barley sugar, ginger, hot cinnamon, allspice, black cherry and dry sherry. The texture is full and poised but never loses a certain crisp freshness. There is a warm dusky heat in the late palate as it leads into the finish that is close to sublime.

Finish: Long. Oily and fruity, with a lingering sweetness and an elusive hint of mint or anise in the aftertaste

Bold but refined and with impeccable balance. This is wonderful whiskey and great value for the price - I don't know what more I can say.

It is best taken neat if you wish to experience the full force of its personality, but if preferred it can take a dash of water to open and soften the experience. The nose is slightly diminished in the process, but the palate is thrown wide open. I'd recommend having two drams, one neat and one watered, so you can have the best of both worlds.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

Along with a few others like Cooper's Croze from Jameson and all of the Spots from Mitchell & Sons (especially the Green), this level of whiskey is a perfect fit for me in terms of price/reward. Along with once-a-year bottles of Midleton Very Rare Irish and Elijah Craig 18 yr. old mixed in, life is very good. Now to start tasting the Smoke and Peat soon. Saints preserve me!

4.0,"I previously worked very close to John's Lane, the site of the long-gone Powers  distillery in Dublin.  In fact I worked on Roe Lane which is the site of the long-gone Roe & Co distillery.  That was once one of the largest distilleries in Dublin and now a brand resurrected by Diageo, who also have plans to build a new distillery on their Guinness lot.   In any case, while I haven't yet tasted DIageo's new fare, I have enjoyed Midleton's output and this is one of my favourite Irish whiskeys.
    
    A little bit of water brings out the best in this, in my opinion, but it is still damn fine neat.  The nose is tiramisu, chocolate, and toffee with a similar smooth taste and the characteristic spiciness of a pot still whiskey.
    
    I first received a miniature bottle of it in an excellent gift pack that included Redbreast 12, Green Spot, and Barry Crockett Legacy. Although not the standout of the four  it is one of my go-to drams on an all too rare night out in Dublin.  An easy 4 stars - often hitting 4.5 depending on my mood and the quantities imbibed."

Nose is aggressive. A little water rounded it off and gave off a note not unlike Honey Nut Cheerios, if you could get drunk off those. Taste was pleasant enough. Typical single pot still maltiness.
