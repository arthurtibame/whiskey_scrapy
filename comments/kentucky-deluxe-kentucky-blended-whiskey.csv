1.0,Great price for mixing but that’s about it.
1.0,"Appearance: The color for this American blend was a surprisingly dark, tawny leather. Its legs were also extremely thin and surprisingly oily.

Nose: On the nose I found notes caramel, musty straw, Smarties candy, and weirdly enough, kale.

Taste: There was not much here as far as taste. Notes of corn syrup, overripe peach, and slight bit of oak were there and after dash of water a cherry note came out.

Finish: The finish was short, and hot & biting on the way down. It left a gulp of soda kind of aftertaste.

Thoughts: The good news is, this whiskey can be found pretty much everywhere and for real cheap! The bad news is, this whiskey is not, in my opinion, worthy of anything more than getting mixed in with soda or getting someone smashed fast (which I do not condone.) I'm happy I can say I tried it, to have the experience to guide friends away from it. Sorry Kentucky Deluxe. Cheers!"
