4.0,"Not sure if I should give this to my wife as a perfume, or drink it.  The nose is quite floral, almost like roses and cotton candy. I keep coming back for the aroma.  Taste is so-so....but I really love this scent.  Really a different style.  I think it's perfect for summer actually---not sure I'd want to be sipping a peaty Lagavulin in 90 degrees, but this I don't mind.  Alison Patel's creation is definitely unique."

3.0,"What an unusual whiskey! If you're looking for something for its sheer originality, this one's definitely it. My first impression was of a strawberry dessert wine: sweet. Too sweet. And while I really enjoy a nose that is reminiscent of strawberry pie, its one-dimensional aspect is just too much for me. The palate has a touch of wood, and a spice that is pretty indiscernible to my tongue (and not great), with a body that feels a little flat and a lot underproofed. Towards the finish, there's a bizarre deviation where the sweetness gives way to bitterness only to then end on a very short note. Strange but worth trying."
3.0,"This is the definition of a dessert whisky. 

Nose: Stone fruits, peaches and apricots, a subtle cinnamon tantalizes the back of your throat, a bit of raspberry, a bit of a creamy note and a touch of dark chocolate. It smells divine. 

Pallet: Sweetness envelops, as the spice begins to rise. Fresh peaches rolled in cinnamon, oak begins to show if held on the pallet for a decent time. Watery mouth-feel. Finish: Short to Medium. Dark chocolate and oak, no fruit on the finish.

Nose part 2: If you go back to it the chocolate note comes to the front with a stronger raspberry note. 

I have had this bottle for a while and the spice has really come up after about 1/4 of the bottle was finished. On a fresh open it was pure fruit and chocolate. Because of this I gave it 3 stars. It is good, but the way it has changed so drastically makes it a open and finish quickly."

4.0,Love this one. It's a regular due to the price. I have a bottle I got as a gift 3 years ago that I've been nursing. Love the smooth and mildly sweet taste
2.0,"Strawberry extract, vanilla frosting, young cognac, licorice and a floral note I can't quite distinguish.  Unfortunately, these flavors do not mesh well for my palate, and the sweetness level of this whisky is generally off the charts. Diabetics be warned."

4.0,"I owe this one at least four stars if just for the originality - I'm not a newcomer to the world of whisky by any means, but I've never encountered one like this before. The nose immediately conjured up those orange Circus Peanuts marshmallow candies. A bit more nosing about in the sweet shop turns up sweet orange, coconut cream pie, marshmallow, vanilla fudge, Sauternes wine, and maybe honey candies. The palate, deceptively, opens up with a deeply savory (almost mushroomy) maltiness, but gives way to marshmallow, candied orange peel, vanilla cream, and a pinch of cinnamon. Still trying to wrap my mind around this one, but it's certainly tasty. I wish it were bottled at a higher ABV, though - it does seem a bit watery at 40%."
3.0,"I love the story behind this whisky, and because of that, this whiskey makes sense. A fruity floral nose, it has pronounced flavors of banana Laffy Taffy and pastry and a little heat from youth. It is a fun whisky, not my favorite, but lots of fun."

4.0,Neat: Love the candy (almost Smarties candy like) nose. This whisky benefits from a small glass that helps concentrate the smell. A wine glass like glass can present a smell of over ripened bananas. Power sugar flavor (again like Smarties candy). Light sweet finish with a touch of vanilla/oak. Light powered sugar finish.

4.0,"Sweet, vanilla. Smooth, tasted different to a usual Whisky really enjoyed it. Cuvee Speciale (different label to what is shown)"
4.5,"Bananas on the nose, not typical bananas but a banana flavored candy. There's a very specific swedish candy called ''skumbanan'' and that's pretty much what I'm getting from it. The taste is more of the same, takes me back to when I was a kid eating these overly sweet banana flavored candies. Also red grapes and oak spice in there. Ripe pears on the finish. 

Definitely not your usual whisky flavors in there, but I really enjoy it for what it is. A really nice and unusual dessert whisky."
3.75,Extremely l that dessert whisky with a wonderfully light and fruity aftertaste. Extremely non traditional in flavor but a pleasant change nonetheless.
5.0,"Wow! This is really interesting, and frankly pretty special. Seems sweet on the nose, lots of banana and caramel, but don't be fooled - the juice is really delightful. Honestly, it's the first whisky I've tried in a long time that made me smile. It's just fun. Brought it to a house party the other night and it was the first bottle gone!

(Pro tip: I've taken to using it for old fashioneds and cutting back on the sugar.)"
3.0,really 3.5.  much better than the last time.  bubble gum.  this is a very unique whiskey
4.0,"3.75 stars

The most intruing mix of whisky, cognac, and amaretto as nose and flavor elements.  The price is enough to make you pause, but in my opinion, worth it."

2.0,Well if you like creaming soda this is right up your alley..blargh this is one of the weirdest whiskies I'd ever tried. If you asked me to guess what it was I'd say it's like someone got base ethanol and added artificial candy like flavour..how is this so highly rated???
4.5,"Cream and vanilla galore at first, with a big kick of spice at the end. A bit discordant but nevertheless tasty."
