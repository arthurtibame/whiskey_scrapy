2.75,"Nice bottle, artificial color, funny gummy bear sweetness. Spiky but soft, fruity sweet, then some sweet spices like cardamom or ginger. Young and weird. Tasted a year later, it is okay, definitely different."

2.0,"Nose is vanilla and ripe pear.
Taste is too sweet and watery.
Not a whisky for me, will see what the rest of the Mackmyra sample set have on offer."

3.0,"Nose: Cereal, malty notes meet fruity allmost floral ones. I get green apple, pears, hints of grapefruit supported by raw oats and cornflakes. It’s a fragrant whisky and I like it. 

Palate: Same as the nose, most promineltly green apples, grapefruit and raw malty oats. 

Finish: Medium-short. Grapefruit bitterness. Just a hint of mill chocholate before it vanishes.

Overall: This whisky is marketed as a bit of a blend-substitute, to be zipped very casually or used for mixing. However, I’d give it more credit than that. Sure, it’s not complex, nor a taste explosion, but it’s a really nice, simple single malt whisky which is one clear cut above any of your your average blends. It actually reminds me a bit of a personal favourite among cheaper single malts - Old Pulteney 12 (though the latter packs slightly more taste and funk). I score Mack 3.0. For the price , I do admit I’d rather get the OP12 (marginal price difference where I live), but both are great upgrades over any average blend and, well worth those few extra bucks!"
