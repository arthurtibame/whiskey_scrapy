4.25,"This is a great whiskey. I am a whiskey afficionado and have many Scotch, Irish and Japanese whiskies. It is very smooth with very little burn. Sweet fruit flavours along with notes of caramel and vanilla. I had my doubts about this whisky as it is only three years old but was blown away. This stacks up with many of my 12+ year single malts.

This is Alberta’s only single malt whisky. It is non-chill filtered,no added colouring and is bottled at 43% ABV. Eau Claire is a grain to glass operation growing all their own grains. All the barley is seeded and harvested with antique horse-drawn equipment."
4.0,"Alberta’s first single malt whisky made from local ingredients. Sweet, smooth and very enjoyable."
