1.0,"I was on the trail for sipping bourbons that had a high wheat content in their mash bill.  I feel like my trail took me to a turnpike with a single destination of a soap factory that I didn't want to visit.   

I thought that my glass was dirty and had left-over dish soap in it.  I ditched my glass and cleaned it out vigorously.   I tried it the next day thinking it was something I ate or drank earlier that day that might be influencing my tastebuds.  

Nope. no. no. no way.  It just tastes like soap.  Their own review includes a taste profile that includes saddle soap.  Is this a recipe that is made from head and tails of a batch of something good?  Who knows.  Someone likes this enough to make it a regular product."

4.25,"Neat.  Party Source 6 year pick.  Wheat bread and cinnamon.  I’d even say a Honey Wheat Bread.  Hint of chocolate.  Salty wood.  Caramel and vanilla.  Black pepper.  This is quite the nose for a low proof wheater.

Nice, creamy mouth feel with brown sugar and cinnamon up front.  Transitions to a salted chocolate.  Now getting some vanilla frosting as well.  Essentially a chocolate cake with vanilla icing.  Short finish.

Awesome store pick.  I have never been a big fan of regular Larcency and have even avoided prior chances at Larceny single barrel.  This pick wins me over though, especially at $23ish bucks."
