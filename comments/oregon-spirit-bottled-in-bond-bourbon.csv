3.0,"Nose: definitely oak, maybe some fruit and chocolate too
Palate: initially cherry? Also some kind of leather note I’m not big on (although not exactly sure what this really is...)
Finish: oak, spice, although the spice softened after the first sip and became much softer/smoother

Every time I drink this I feel like I think something different. More than once I’ve found this repulsive, but today is one of those days where I’m finding the soft, straightforward flavor pretty nice. Not a bad bourbon, but for the price it’s a very poor value to me."
