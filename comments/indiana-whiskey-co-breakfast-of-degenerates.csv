3.5,"Neat in Glencairn glass. Purchased at Citywide Liquor in Mishawaka, IN.

Nose: Sweet maple and pecans.

Taste: Very sweet maple hits front and center. Mid palate is some nuttiness. 

Finish is some lingering sweetness without much heat.

Drinks super-smooth. Good for when you want something sweet and easy drinking. Would be perfect around a fall bonfire."
