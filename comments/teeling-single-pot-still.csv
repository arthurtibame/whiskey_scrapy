3.5,"My sample comprised spirit aged for four to five years, half drawn from first-fill ex-bourbon casks with a quarter each from virgin American oak and ex-Oloroso sherry. Flavorwise, It delivers melting vanilla ice cream and white pepper on the nose, a fruity palate and a lightly spicy finish. A step up from Teeling Small Batch."
