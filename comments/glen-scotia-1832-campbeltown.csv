3.75,"It claims to be “rich and gently smoky”, and I think that’s a very fair and accurate description. Oak was strong at first, but after a little ice the sherry came through a bit better. It reminded me of the Glenmorangie 18 but with a very slight peaty taste. Bought at Heathrow Duty Free World. £52 for one, £90 for two. All prices are for 1L bottles."

3.75,第一次喝到坎培爾鎮的威士忌，非常驚豔的胡椒香料氣味，喝起來有烏梅汁加香草的味道，如果喝膩雪莉風味或泥煤煙燻，可以試看看另一個獨特的味道！很棒！

5.0,"Possibly the best Scotch on the planet.  I prefer peaty, smoky Whisky with smooth flavour. I normally stock up on Laphroaig and of those, the Quarter Cask and Cask Strength are my favorites. I was introduced to Geln Scotia 'Cambeltown 1832' at a Duty Free and have been hooked ever since. It is a unique Whiskey. It is not it's initial taste that impresses, but the incredibly long, smooth and addictive finish it has. It truly is the definition of savoring a Whisky. Interestingly the 16 year old is nowhere near as smooth and the Double Cask likewise. Nice, but 'Cambeltown 1832' is in a class of its own."

4.0,"Campbeltown... The land flowing with milk and honey, and the oft forgotten great whisky region of Scotland. And to make matters worse, Glen Scotia is the less appreciated distillery. Deservedly, I should add, because how many distilleries can compete with Springbank? But enough about that...

This expression is delicious! Butterscotch, malted barley, honey and salt. Simple enough, yes? There's some bitterness on the finish, and the nose is better than the palate.

Still... great stuff!"
