3.0,"The low ABV really hurts this bourbon, as it lacks depth or length. Despite that, it's pleasant, with notes of chatted oak, cherry and vanilla."

null,"Very sweet nose (very cherry, vanilla, cinnamon, cloves) gets a little smokey (cedar, almost pipe tobacco like) after the first sip. 
Rich smokey taste with cherry and warm vanilla and cherry notes.  Hot and peppery finish."
