1.75,My god what a waste of 12 years and a Amontillado cask. Their entry level stuff has brutal scores so I went for the best I could find..after tasting this i was thinking how do they stay in business but I'm guessing half their run goes for sanitizer or similar and it's like they just chuck the remainder into oak barrels... really not good..tastes like a sweet bad grappa..the first whisky tonight i had to vigorously rinse my mouth out..
