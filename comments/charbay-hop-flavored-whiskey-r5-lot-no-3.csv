5.0,"Long and complex flavor profile.  I get less bitterness than many others, but taste the hops with a remarkably persistent floral finish."

4.0,Nose like the biggest Imperial IPA you can imagine. Some vanilla/oak.  A distinct bitterness comes with the alcohol. Strong floral finish.  Interesting stuff.

2.0,"Awful. I don't get the appeal--this is novelty through-and-through, the kind of whiskey you'd do as shots to gross your friends out (or would if it was affordable; this isn't). Smells like asparagus, hops, and marijuana and not much else; tastes like asparagus and leafy greens, with some biscuity maltiness, and then there's a weird almost peaty, smoky character. Bitter, leafy finish, but on the plus side it vanishes pretty quickly. I don't quite have the heart to give it less than two stars because--c'mon--it is exactly what it says it is. On the other hand, who the hell was crying out for a young whiskey distilled from an IPA mash? Blech."
