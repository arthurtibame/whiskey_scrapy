3.75,"The first single malt distillery in sweden, distilling since 1999 and output only going to single malts. I usually don't comment on the nose but wow; my wife thought Baileys or Amarula, and she's right along with cotton candy cherry butterscotch on the palate. Nice drop indeed. The more I get into it the sweet cherry dr pepper cough syrup gets a bit over powering but still definitely a 3.75 at least."
