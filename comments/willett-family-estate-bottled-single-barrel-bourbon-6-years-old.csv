Neck pour in Norlan, sitting for 15 minutes. Splash of water.

Sticky sweet honey and vanilla up front. Notes of lemon and orange zest, dark chocolate, black plums, nutmeg and cinnamon each meld beautifully with each other. Cherry cola notes linger as well. Very seamless nose if not a little tame for the proof .

Honey and vanilla jump out first followed by notes of fruity pastry. Think pear tart with some whipped cream on top. But before these sweet notes take over, you get a nice hit of oak char and pumpkin pie spice. Mouthfeel is superb with great viscosity and weight.

What stands out most to me in this bourbon is the finish, dominated by chocolate malted milk balls and vanilla that goes on for minutes. Absolutely stellar and memorable.

First WFE, quite impressed with all they packed in this bottle in 6+ years."

4.25,"Neat. Neck pour. Store pick.  Intense amount of fruit on the front of the nose.  Cherry and strawberries.  Intense vanilla and toffee.  Very little oak but a good amount of spice on the tail end.  

Thinner feel than I was expecting for a barrel proof.  Extremely alcohol forward on the tongue.  I don’t typically feel that much burn.  Working around the alcohol and those fruit flavors dominate the tongue with their sweetness in combination with the spice.  Burnt caramel.  Intense cherry and vanilla.  This is potent stuff.  Intense flavors.  Getting a deep chocolate on the legs now.  Essentially a cherry cordial linking these flavors together.

This is my first WFE Bourbon experience.  The nose struck me as a bit generic at first and the alcohol forward nature was disappointing me.  But the intense flavors throughout won me over big time.  Really delicious.  Left my mouth numb though.  Loses points for that aspect, but I now understand the hype on these bottles."

After chatting with the owner about bourbon and having been a loyal customer, we went to the back and brought this up.
Let’s see how it is...
The nose has vanilla, cinnamon, other banking spices. Very Christmas-like. Which reminds me of Rowan’s Creek and the Pot Still. But then there’s a dark fruit note a little further in, like plumb.
The palate is hits you with those baking spices big time. It’s powerful, but not over powering like other Barrel proofers.
Then it digs into the barrel and you get some nice oak notes. After a few sips I added some water, which it takes well. 
The finish is nice and long. You get that initial burn as it goes down and then the flavors linger on the tongue.
Since this one is very reminiscent of other Willett offerings, I decided to compare it to the Pot Still and Rowan’s Creek. Obviously the Willett 6yr is much higher proof than the others, so it stands out there. But I found that Rowan’s Creek had some nice depth for being 50.05% abv. I think I like the Willett 6yr better, but I’ll have to see at another tasting."

4.5,"Almost perfect; i encourage you to have a little water alongside between sips, so that you can taste the bourbon and not just the alcohol. Dark/ripe pear, plum, some very light acidity, rich baking spices of course (cinnamon especially), worth it"
