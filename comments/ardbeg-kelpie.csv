4.5,"Usually with the Islay malts I reckon you just can't beat their standard flagship malts e.g. Laphroaig 10, Lagavulin 16, especially once price is factored in. However for Ardbeg I personally believe its the complete opposite. The 10 is ok the Kelpie I much prefer. I was very interested to see the influence of the virgin black sea oak casks and they don't disappoint. When better to try it than Ardbeg day! Sweet, pepper and peat marry together beautifully. Definitely a 4.5 - unfortunately  at $135 USD I just can't round up to a 5. The committee release was only $15 more so I thought why not I'll get one. I signed up to the committee on the spot, turned round to get a bottle and they were all gone...damn! Oh well got a free Ardbeg glass as a consolation..."

5.0,"People might wonder why I would give this 5 stars, but here's the deal. First, see my notes on the Committee Release. This bottle is that without any additives. No water needed, and it's damn good. Now, will it hurt having a few drops here and there? Negative. So, if you want to feel like you are travelling to the high seas near the Black Sea, while fighting the Kraken, then this is the bottle for you. I loooooove it."

5.0,"Ardbeg Embassy, Gamla Stan, Stockholm: Not sure it was a good idea to try the Ardbeg Kelpie as my first Ardbeg, but oh well. When I lived in Aberdeen I had a Greek friend who loved Turkish tobacco. Now, I don't smoke, but the lovely sweet smell of the Turkish tobacco definitely made me think about smoking. My first impression of this offering from Ardbeg took me back to those days in the pub in Aberdeen with my Greek buddy. Let me just say from nose to finish this was a fantastic whisky. Not only was there lovely peat smoke, but it was just the perfect amount, and so similar to Turkish tobacco. The palate is balanced to perfection, with lovely cardemum, pepper and a hint of allspice. Add some water and lemon comes rushing out. The finish lingers like the smoke from a Turkish cigarette, swirling around and around, just beckoning you to take the next sip, like a siren calling you in a tale from ancient Greece. Problem is I need to buy a bottle of this now, seriously need one, and in Sweden that means shelling out 999 SEK ($125 USD), definitely not over priced, IMHO"
4.0,"It must be so hard being the creative distillery brains at Ardbeg.  How do you beat their standard flag bearers like Uigi, Corry, and 10?  There's really not much at a reasonable price point that can beat those three.  You need to dig deep deep into your pockets to even come just marginally better.  That's the issue here with Kelpie.  It's good.  Better than many other whiskies at this price point.  The new wood does it wonders; marriage of peat and that unique Black Sea wood works.  But...would I buy this again?  No...I'd rather just stick with the Uigi, Corry, or 10.   It's really good to try it, and I feel as if I certainly didn't waste my money (which can't be said for over 50% of these one off whiskies...I feel as if I'm funding a charity science lab).   Really worthwhile to try once, but can't beat the standards."

4.0,"Tastes exactly like a watery version of the Committee edition, as it should, but it's still a good dram. That wasn't true of last year's Dark Cove, which was splendid in its Committee clothing but uninspiring in its weaker rendition. Flavors of smoked fish abound."

4.0,"Well, it's the Tuesday evening before Thanksgiving and there is a chill in the air.  Wood stove is running.  House is full of family.  The youngest is home from college.  All is right with the world at this moment in time.  Sort through the samples from the SDT (I am so far behind and in need of working through the backlog) and what better pour is there than Ardbeg.

A rubber-esq and smokey, seaweed briny sweetness fills the nasal senses. Nutty caramel and brown sugar come through along with pungent lemon polish and a hint of Iodine.  Very much an Ardbeg brethren.  Can I have a sip now?

The palate is greeted with a deep, rich peaty char.  Almost tar-like.  Traces of brown sugar take the tarry btternes in check and blends.  As the sweetness is absorbed and weakend, oak, black pepper and a bakers dark chocolate intermingle and bring you to a finish.

A lemon zest provides a foundation of the finish where cigar ash and coal tar take front and center.  Add a dash of black pepper for some spice. A deep and earthy ending.

An Ardbeg foundation that, for peat freaks (hand raised), is very much satisfying.  Though it's peaty with a sweety-brine, it does have a weakness in that it has a somewhat rushed quality and a bright youngness.  The flavors are there but are not overly vibrant (Could it be tired casks squeezing the last bit of flavor from them?)  That being said, I did enjoy this, and is a good dram.  I do still prefer the 10 or Ugi, and at $30 to $50 dollars cheaper.  [Dry Glass: Peated bog][86/100][Tasted: 11/21/17]"

5.0,God almighty. This is incredible.
4.0,"This years annual release from Ardbeg is Kelpie. Matured in virgin oak from the shores of the Black Sea. This is the standard release version, not the committee release which I will be reviewing later. Bottled at 46% ABV and non chill filtered. I believe it is also natural color of a pale gold. 

A full and rich nose. Voluminous peat smoke, but also quite sweet. Lemon cakes and buttery blueberry muffins. The lemon notes are strong here, but sweeter than the 10 year old, which I find on the tart side. Fireplace ashes, creosote and tar. Beautiful. Lots of creamy vanilla, apples, pears and apricots. Salty seaweed, tobacco and leather. Truly a wonderful nose. The Black Sea oak gives this a very different feel than the Corryvreckan, but does not give quite the level of complexity (probably due to the fact that it's at 46% vs the 57.1% of the Corryvreckan). After some time it gets sweeter, like maple syrup. I could nose this all day. 

The palate is smoky and sweet. Not too intense at 46%, quite smooth really. Huge peat smoke, ashes, seashore. Peppery oak, licorice, lemon cakes. Rich oak, clove and ginger. Vanilla cream and salted caramels and chocolate. Marvelous. 

A medium to full body, oily but turns dry. 
The finish is long, smoky and sweet syrup. Dry

Simply Ardbeg. Boy do I love Ardbeg! So much flavor. Smoke smoke smoke. Again, not as complex as the great Corryvreckan, but more than the 10 year old delivers. That Black Sea oak really added a nice layer to this one. At around $110 I'd say that it's worth the price. Not perfect but really good. Can't wait to try that committee release. A huge thanks to Pranay who provided this sample. Solid 4.5
Cheers"

5.0,"This NAS whisky from Ardbeg was released in honor of this year’s Feis Isle festival in Islay, Scotland.  It’s named after a mythical, shape-shifting water beast that circles the island and terrorizes the locals.  The whisky was released in two variations:  the regular release and a special committee version that is cask strength.  I had the good fortune to be able to try both of these side-by-side thanks to a friend in NJ and as an extra in our distillery trade group.  This review is for the regular release that comes in at a robust 46% ABV.  As with most Ardbeg’s, it has no color added and is NCF’d.

It is primarily made from a special collection of virgin oak casks from a region off the coast of the Black Sea and another undisclosed batch of Ardbeg stock.  It’s a beautiful, glimmering yellow gold and creates some watery, slow forming legs when you spin it.  All the typical Ardbeg brine, creosote and campfire notes are initially present, as well.

The nose opens smoky with a nice balance of sweet, Gala apples and a hint of lemon zest.  Slightly sub-tropical fruits are here, too.  Brine and seaweed add some bite.  The opening notes on the tongue reveal earthy and salty peat, more traditional smoke and some intense, bittersweet chocolate.  It’s very inviting.  The finish is long and drying with the peppery heat from the oak.  An additional bit of salinity and seaweed remains behind here, too.  Great stuff.

Overall, it’s another amazing NAS dram from Ardbeg.  It lacks the super complexity of Oog-a-dal and the CorryV, but damn I’d love to turn this one into a staple in my home.  The price is a bit higher than the core stuff, mostly due to the whole Feis Isle money grab...errr festival special release.  It is worth the extra dough.  It’s another magical dram from Ardbeg.  Seek it out and enjoy everything it has to offer.  You won’t be disappointed.  4.75 stars.  Cheers, my friends."

4.0,"Scotland, September 2017 (from notes).

The nice tour guide man pours me a dram, I nose and ... HANG ON - THIS IS LAPHROAIG ... Oh, no it's not. That's the immediate impression. The most Laphroaig-y Ardbeg ever. Once I got over the oblique association I started to taste this properly, and it's not at all a bad dram.

Nose: Very smoky, with the phenolic, tarry, hospital bandage quality that is normally not part of the Ardbeg arsenal of aromas. However their trademark sweetness is also lurking in an array of fruity aromas that slowly start to emerge from the depths (some time in the glass, warming and a drop of water helps this happen). Stewed fruits / tinned fruit salad / grapefruit / pineapple / even some faint cherry and apple danish (!).

Palate: Smooth, smoky, nutty, sea wrack and flotsam starting to decompose on a sandy strand with gulls crying overhead. It's a very evocative taste. As it develops it turns spicy with ginger, anise, caraway, cloves and allspice plus some citrus zest. Again, it’s slightly different from its Ardbeg stablemates.

Finish: The smokey peat and brine fades out into an interesting salt/sweet/citrus finish, that is satisfyingly long.

A class act, and pretty stunning for what is almost certainly a young NAS. My only reservation is the price, which is not unreasonable – just steep. Hmmm, can this distillery do no wrong?

“Very Good” : 4 stars"

4.0,"How is this an 86? Definitely deserves higher score than that; believe the community is right on this at 4.3 (right on, LeeEvolved at 4.75). I found it more impressive upon open than most and it got better as it oxidized. Granted, the bottle is pretty much finished a mere few months after picking it up but the nose and flavors expanded and shifted over that time.  The smoke isn't as ""in your face"" as some other choices; I find it a veyr pleasant player. Chocolate is definitely here. Bacon, too... so, chocolate covered bacon anyone?  This is just plainly good; I do own bottles of the Corry and Uige and it puts up a nice challenge."

4.75,"Smokey barbecue sauce on the nose.
Vegetal, earthy peat flavor typical of Ardbeg.  Strong salt/brine.  Decent smoke, but lighter than I was expecting.  Quite sweet, also characteristic of Ardbeg.  Strong, lingering treacle flavor emerges rather late.  More smoke emerges in the finish, but still not as smokey as I was expecting.  Strong black pepper in the finish that gives way to barbecue sauce.  Hints of horseradish late.

I think that I like it comparably to the cheaper Uigeadail."

4.0,"Easy to drink. Oily, brine, salty with a hint of smoke. Vanilla on the finish and sweetness."
4.25,Super pleasant and approachable for an Islay. Smokey (of course) with some spice and a sweet caramel finish.
4.75,"This is heaven in a glass. Everything an Islay scotch drinker that loves brine and smoke could ever want. Nose is earthy almost vegetal peat smoke (like 1/2 highland and 1/2 normal islay ardbeg peat), smoked meat, peppered bacon, vanilla, honey, sea spray, lemon zest. Taste is really where this whisky shines as the black oak gives a rush of a sweetness and honey first, followed by fruit and then the smoke, citrus bite and barrel spice kick in almost a high rye bourbon/rye whisky spice, followed up by the salty briny quality and ends in oak. The finish as with most peated Islays is loooonggg. The spice is the first to die out and the brine and mild oak along with the peat smoke and honey are the ones that hang around the longest. The end of the finish leaves you with just the salt brine and honey after taste. Like a very intense and more interesting Caol Ila 12. Too bad this wasn't sustainable as a core range. From what I'm told the Corryvrecken is almost like this without the sweetness and more spice. Consolation prize I guess when my three bottles of this angel are gone. Always hope though for a bring back as committee release supernova 5.0 hit shelves."

1.0,"Ardbeg and fish? Lets give it a shot.

Nose - Pepper, even smoke, a bit of a fishy brine at the back end. I'm also getting distinct slightly burnt caramel. 

Taste - I don't to just start with this is 46% and it's hitting me as having too much alcohol. That's really disappointing. Similarly, I'm getting pepper, spices likely from the unique european oak used here. It's astringent, punchy, and frankly it leaves me not wanting to go back for another sip. Upfront it's a bold sweetness but god each time it goes back into this harsh bitter note and then I get hit with alcohol burn as if this is an extremely young whisky. Alcohol brings out more of the fishy element, it still is bitter, peppery, and now the sweetness up front which was nice is gone. The finish is more cigarette ash smoke with some charcoal thrown in. 

I can't get past how young this tastes, it's got some new make grain like elements and just terrible casks. I keep hoping this will change and everytime I go back I feel like I enjoy it less.

1 star - there's good stuff here so i can't go below a 1 where I'm more or less saying it's undrinkable and bad, but this is a strong pass."

4.5,"Marine is marine, no doubt about it, and in this the kelpie could well represent it. Indeed, considering how deep and thick is the smell, the desire to be dragged into the glass like the Scottish demon does to its victims is well on spot. Cloves, very intense, are propped up on a blanket of acrid and brackish smoke, smoked herring and tar, from which you can discern an apple pie with cream that resists strenuously to this assault, like a victim of the lake demon. Ardbeg do not break even with the wood of the Dead Sea!
The peat ocean soup ignites and burns in the mouth, with the smoke here more meaty that thins out leaving more space for the sweet soul of the whisky, caramelized and sugary with a delicate supply of apple. Pepper olives stuffed with licorice, medicinal touch in the background. A contrast that confuses and even stuns, layered and unusual: Ardbeg less Ardbeg than usual but very Ardbeg. Clear, isn't it?
The finish is long, very, of ash and algae, dried fish and caramel, pepper.
I have to sya that they the name they chose is just perfect. It is not a balanced but certainly complex whisky, enthralling and fun, with moments of sincere bewilderment.
An experiential drink, like not many others can give you."
4.5,"I sat down to do a re-review of this Ardbeg that I tasted over 2 years ago, hoping that I would find something new, something previously undiscovered. The previous review was from a sample, this was not a bottle that has been open 2+ years. But no, it’s the same amazingness as before. 

The nose is incredible and unique for an Ardbeg in that the sweetness carries it almost as much as the smoke does. 

The palate, while not too complex is very satisfying. I will say that I did get a bit of a rubbery note this time that I did not get before, not that that’s a bad thing. 

Still amazing, still a 4.5

For further details, see my published works on this subject...just look up my last review lol. 
Cheers."
