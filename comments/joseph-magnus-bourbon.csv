4.5,"This bourbon is outstanding! I was initially hesitant about paying $99 for a bottle but to me, it turned out to be worth every penny. I've seen the price as low as around $80 and that would be an excellent bargain. If you're worried about it being too sweet or overly sherried, that isn't the case. It is rich however and extremely smooth. You can pick out complexities in this all day long. It's like a fine jazz ensemble of top musicians, tightly playing at a small exclusive club that has the most acoustically balanced tones and you're palate is standing in the sweet spot.

1.0,"Dark fruits and slight oak on the nose. Reminded me of the Rhetoric 22 on first nose. First taste was WAY more different than expected. I guess it’s smokey, a bit of mint and a funky—musty flavor that hits hard. No alcohol burn, but not something I really enjoyed. There’s a taste of tobacco and leather that I normally like but the musty flavor is throwing me off BIG TIME. Tastes nothing like a typical bourbon. Almost as disappointing to me as the Old Potrero 18th Century. I wish I had tried this before buying. But saw it for a good price and heard some reviews that sounded promising. I have doubts that it will even work for me in an old fashioned.

4.0,"For those who like sweet, complex, dessert-style bourbons, Joseph Magnus is a strong contender.  For those who want a craft distillery pedigree with an interesting story behind it (the family that owns it traces it lineage to a pre-Prohibition era distiller, for whom they named the brand), Joseph Magnus is a strong contender.  For those who want a critically well-reviewed bourbon, Joseph Magnus, which has won a bevy of gold medals at San Francisco's high-end Spirits Competition, is a strong contender.  Now, for those who want an affordable bourbon . . . not so much.  This is a $80-100 bourbon, which means this DC-based label places itself among the limited releases and double-digit aged expressions from the best Kentucky distilleries.  Moreover, it asks such high prices despite not distilling its own product -- this, like Belle Meade and many other brands, is actually sourced MGP bourbon from Indiana, albeit finished in a variety of casks (sherry, port, and cognac) in their DC warehouse.  Perhaps one day they'll have aged their own distillate enough to transition fully to their own product but, right now, the ask is $100 for a bottle of finished MGP.  To its tremendous credit, it's worth it, and I thought long and harda bout ordering a bottle after getting home.  This is a rich, tasty bourbon, with vivid syrup and fruit notes:  vanilla, strawberry, and some smoke from the barrel char, which hints at chocolate and coffee.  Coincidentally, my friends and I stumbled upon this distillery while we lived in DC, and it also has a great tasting room and an incorporated cocktail bar inside the warehouse space itself, where one can see barrel upon barrel of this bourbon still aging."

3.0,"Nose - Strong oaky vanilla, dark caramel, light cherry/strawberry candy, sweet cream butter.

Taste - Drying & tannic mouthfeel, sweet oaky vanilla caramel, strawberry preserves, light chocolate latte foam sweet, cherry syrup, light cinnamon, drying oak.

Finish - Drying oak, light cinnamon heat, cherry/strawberry syrup-like sweetness, oak.

Score - 81/100

Final Thoughts - Relatively pleasant nose, a bit on the oaky side, yet ""soft"" on the nose in that it doesn't have the heavy/dark caramel I like from a good Elijah Craig Barrel Proof. It almost feels as if they finished this in a microbarrel for all 3 finishes as it picked up quite a bit of oak, but has this nice soft sweet very lightly fruity finish. This one was quite strange for me, it didn't smell overoaked but it was quite tannic on the palate, combined with a sweetness that is very difficult to explain in that I didn't get the usual dark dried stone fruits from the sherry but it tasted more of a fresh fruit syrup sweet. This was a bit confusing from start to finish and while not unpleasant, not something I think I'd reach for very often.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No, especially at current prices."

4.0,"Overall, Magnus ranges anywhere from a 3-5+ stars so I settled on 4.  This is one complex bourbon.  It needs time in the glass to really open up.  Constantly reminded of cherry coke, but there is a ton of depth here.  Never had anything quite like it.  Value is questionable, but if you walk off the beaten path grab yourself a bottle."

4.25,"This is in the sherry-finish division of my finished bourbon bracket. It was Joseph Magnus vs Noble Oak, winner to go against Wild Turkey Revival. In a blind taste test, Joseph Magnus won. As always... this is for science.

Blind was kind of impossible. Although price doesn’t always mean better, $90 vs $30 was meaningful here. I wasn’t fooled for a second.

Nose contains sugar and caramel. Reminds me a lot of barrel strength bourbons. Body is where the sherry influence kicks in. There’s a bit of sugar and leather in there, and the feel is overwhelmingly dry. On the finish, raisin and cinnamon carry off with very low heat. The dryness from the sherry truncates the flavors noticeably.

On value: wouldn’t buy again. It’s good, it’s a fun experience, and it’s very full of flavor. Just not a repeat buy.

UPDATE: Joseph Magnus lost to WT Revival in a blind taste test. WT now to go against the winner of the port wine finish bracket, TBD. This versus was ridiculously close. I actually preferred the body of this guy to the Revival. At the end of the day, my choice came down to smoothness, and Wild Turkey won big there. Joseph Magnus seems dominated by sherry, where Wild Turkey Revival, by comparison, seems merely influenced by it. To me, that makes the Joseph Magnus a good drink, and the Revival a great one."

3.75,"Interesting. The nose was initially unusual and perplexing . I knew nothing of the multiple barreling at the time and as a result my initial nosing confused me. Smells of cigar ash and dark jammy fruits . The palate has flavors of sherry and stewed plums . After seeing the barreling procedures, it definitely makes sense now . I can’t say I either loved or hated this . I found it intriguing probably more so than enjoyable. That’s not to say I won’t return to try this again and actually looking forward to trying it again soon when I can spend more time with it"
3.0,"Neat.  Sherry and oak hit immediately.  Baking spice. Vanilla.  Very nice nose.

Texture is thin.  Flavor hits you over the head with sherry and cognac. There is even some harshness to it.  Maple emerges.  Vanilla.

Ugh I can’t drink this. I’m sad.  Nose was so good too.  I hope this opens up."

3.0,"of note:
this is a tasting of the Joseph Magnus Cigar Blend #3, specifically a barrel pick. 

nose:
raisins, grain, some wood. not as crunchy and oaky as i would’ve expected, to be honest. 

palate:
there’s the oak. again, not as aggressive as i would’ve thought based on the branding of this bottle. not sure of the proof on this but it drinks mad smooth for what i believe is actually a barrel proof. 
a little thin in the body, with long skinny legs in the glass. 

finish: short, satisfying, a little peppery. some sage or savory herbs?"

3.25,"A sample gifted from the ""Whiskey Transfer Program"" from dthom.  I like this.  It didn't blow me away but it's good and kind of unique.

Nose: Heavy wood with flavors I often expect from a sherry aged scotch.   A pronounced sweet vanilla flavor with dried fruits.  A strong alcohol bite at first but after sitting in the glass a couple minutes this subsided.

Flavor: Cherry and lots of it, wood, honey, and more dried fruits.  A lot of nutty flavors like pistachio and walnut.

Finish: Long finish with more wood flavors and caramel sweetness transitioning to a long minty trail off.

I think I like the nose and initial flavors more than the finish but this is a solid whiskey just WAY overpriced.  If this were $40-$50 I could see this being something I'd keep around."

4.5,"Nose: cherries, cigar ash, wet leather, licorice (red and black), pepper, and crushed mint leaves. 

Taste: nutmeg, clove,  , leather, bitter sweet dark chocolate, a full body cigar, and burnt sugar.

Experience: Muted luxury. 
Dark chocolate, leather seats, big bookshelves, a thick and deep experience, not a flash in the pan.
 It's not a gold watch but a leather couch. Not a Lamborghini but a custom Land Rover. Money made from having a better product than anyone else, not investing in bit coin. 
What I am trying to get at is it's not sweet or flashy but deep and well made. Lots to find if you care to take your time  but none of it will impress your friends unless they know what to look for. 


I'll admit I was not expecting as much as I got. This is a fantastic example of why new distillers should be spending less time worrying about pure Bourbon and more time experimenting with finishes."

4.0,"Oh my old friend, we're here once again.  Batch 46.

Nose - I love scotch, I love bourbon, but my lord I love Cognac finished bourbon.  There's is just something about it.  That note of oak and vanilla with this old dried fruit and I just get this ""feeling"" of something dried out that's falling apart in such a good and pleasant way...I can't explain it, but I get it on these cognac finished whiskies.  As soon as I think this one is over however I get those red fruits from the sherry and then I get this sherry sweetness from the PX barrels I assume.  Just masterful blending of nuances and notes.  

Taste - Dark fruit, aged wine that's sat far too long in oak, oak, a touch of vanilla at first, some sour grapes but again muted by oak, .  I'm just not sure how to explain sherry and cognac without just say this tastes like the best of cognac with hints of sherry.  

Simply put Jos A Magnus is one of the best whiskies on the market and it can be found at or just under 100 bucks.  Folks, this is a master class whisky and I just hope they're able to keep sourcing the 12 year old MGP juice for these.  I know some of the single barrels are going to Dickle...and they're terrible next to the MGP ones.  

I still need get another Murray Hill Reserve to do a review on that one, spoiler - the one I had was great, but so far everything I've had from magnus that was a non store pick has been outstanding.  I've had one store pick (not sure how or what to do to review those here) that was pretty underwhelming and one that's outstanding.  So when they let Nancy do her thing....they're getting some magic.  

4.0 - what does it need to be higher?  Honestly, I'm not 100% sure.  Some Older juice would help as I think the casks are getting too much play and a bit older whisky might standup and push back on the casks.  Overall yeah I think the casks are a bit too intense on the front and the bourbon really shines on the way down.  This is such good bourbon under the casks that I think a bit more even play would be ideal."

Awards: 2016, 2017 and 2019 Double Gold San Francisco Spirits

I had to try it. Tasted in GC. Rested for 15 minutes

N(4.25):Creamy sherry. Tiny bit of oak, no tannin. Slight cocoa. A bit of an ethanol bite on the nose. Purple mint leaves. Dried ginger roots. Cinnamon. Cherry and Vanilla if you pull away from the GC. It's unique and complex. I continue to pick up different smells every time I revisit it
P(4):sherry right off the bat. Nice coating mouth feel. Some heat, but not aggressive. It can sit your mouth while you hunt for the flavors. burnt caramel. 
F(4.5): bitter sherry. Cognac sweetness. Dark dark chocolate like 86%. Clove. Caramel. Grapes. Vanilla come to visit and leaves. No hug. Medium intensity and medium to long finish. 

Recommendation: Very interesting and complex. It doesn't demand a revisit, instead something to be studied. Won't be my daily drinker, instead something to share with friends who drink whiskey, wine, and/or cognac. Definitely a buy for those looking for variety, but not someone who is starting out."
4.75,"Let it rest 15 minutes based on comments here. Ethanol in the nose died down significantly to reveal smoky caramel and oak. Palate is complex and deep. Notes of spice, char, caramel, and vanilla dance with stone fruits and mild sherry. Finish is long and pleasant. This drinks like it needs to be enjoyed in a smoky speakeasy with smooth jazz and a nice maduro cigar."
3.25,This was quite the underwhelming dram to me especially considering the price tag. I relegated it to cocktails and felt guilty doing so because of the cost. I would certainly not purchase this again and would be leery of other expressions from Jo. Mag.

Nose is burnt caramel, but also an underlying ethanol that can burn you if you inhale to deeply.  Taste brings more caramel with some intense heat.
