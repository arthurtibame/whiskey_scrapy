5.0,"Coming into this bottle I expected apple pie level spices. I didn't get that, but what i did get was so much better. The nose is sweet with honey and marzipan, but the palate is where it really gets started. Here you'll find loads of cinnamon nutmeg and some clove. These spices might sound like a lot to handle but are delivered with that signature sweetness. On the finish i noticed a fantastic maltiness that combines with the spices to produce a beautiful and complex finish. I sat on this bottle for a while; don't make the same mistake as i did. Enjoy it ASAP!"

5.0,"The name is spot on. The introduction begins with sweet caramel almost candy apple but not like a GLenlivet expression. It has a lemongrass overtone that melds with the caramel. Vanilla notes on the nose carry through the tasting profile and then ""the event"" happens upon your taste buds. A squad of little dancing fairies begin to tickle the tongue with exactly what the name eludes to: Spice: It's a sweet cardamom spice with a pinch of pepper that could draws a long lasting saturation on the tongue. Feel for sweet, roasted spiced nuts. Great sipping in hot or cold weather. No ICE, but a drop or two of water enhances it's profile. I'd say moderate the addition of water as it's younger brother Oak Cross will be what you're concocting. My new favorite whiskey especially on sale for $43 at my loal Liquor store."

Also for me it has a HUGE honey note, as it actually tastes like someone put honey in the whisky taste (not a bad thing). It's not the best whisky in the world but it's price is competing against glenlive 12 glenfiddich 12 and it blows them out of the water so 5/5 for that"

        Nose: Citrus peel, blood orange?, cinnamon and red apples.
        
        Taste: Ginger, allspice, clove, very hot, bursts of cherry syrup. Wave after wave of flavor. Creamy mouthfeel.
        
        Finish: Toffee, vanilla, apples and honey, long and fruity. Wow!
        
        This has a very similar flavor profile to Aberlour. It’s the best blended Scotch I’ve ever had however I struggle to find a place for it.

4.0,"Nose: Very rich and featuring malt, apples, oak and gingery spice. There's a waxy character that adds depth and texture.

Palate: Full and assured arrival with fruity and mixed spice notes. The arrival blooms seamlessly into the development as more fruit notes (particularly orange) emerge to balance a cavalcade of warm, exotic spice - clove, cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. However the palate is no explosion or cheap thrill. Everything is poised and perfectly balanced.

Finish: Medium. Very satisfying - fruit and spice nuances roll on and on into the aftertaste.

This is arguably the best of the standard Compass Box whiskies. One of the most complex and sophisticated blends I've tasted - it wipes the floor with just about every other blended whisky and I'd even have a bottle of this in preference to many single malts at the same price. Terrific value, and an education in a glass.

I've been tasting several blends over the last fortnight with some mates, and the one thing we all noticed was how refreshing and ""clean"" all the Compass Box whiskies are. In comparison, most blends strive for a house style that is heavy and rich, and they achieve that goal with varying success.  Compass Box seems to be alone in preferring a clean and uncluttered style that uses a few premium components combined with consummate precision. When you also factor in the very reasonable asking price this whisky represents remarkable value.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"
5.0,"From Compass Box sample box containing five different 50mL vials from their “core range.”  I was able to get this on sale for $30.  Spice Tree is the best out of the five; Asyla, Oak Cross, Peat Monster, and Hedonism are the others.  It is also the one that is the boldest and has an unabashed history of being once deemed illegal per the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA).  I have never tasted the illegal version of Spice Tree, but word of mouth is that the newer versions approximate the illegal ones, which are now worth a million dollars.  And word of mouth is fuck the SWA, because Compass Box caters to those who are always right: me, the consumer.

NOSE: After sampling 10mL in a Glencairn, I poured the remaining 40mL into my ridiculous fishbowl sized cognac sniffer because the smell is that potent!  This year in my whisky education, I am learning that peat is not the only way to grow chest hair.  Whisky in French oak becomes incredibly spicy, and to have this whisky be 80% matured in new French oak is insane.  Let this one sit for 10 minutes, and smell it.  Spice is crazier than peat is the conclusion.  Almost overwhelming clove, allspice, white pepper.  In the background, eucalyptus, lemon, and maybe a little culantro.

PALATE: Doughy, oily, grassy, and utterly unique.  Tree barkiness: maple syrup with maple wood, cedar, oak, redwood.  Hints of raisins and vanilla.  The spiciness definitely dominates.  Missing some smokiness, otherwise you would have Talisker…

FINISH: Youthy plastic notes detract from the experience, but you get a fairly long afterburn of spice.  Breathtaking development of ginger and lemon.  Some allspice and clove continues.  It’s like a spicy alcoholic green tea!

WITH WATER: Water amplifies spice.  Do add a few drops.  This lets you know the burn is not from the ethanol.  The nose and the finish are improved, and the name “Spice Tree” does not do this dram justice.  I would go with “Spicefuck.”

VERDICT: Out of the 5 in this Compass Box sample pack, this is the only one that encourages me to purchase a full bottle.  I am buying the full version of this ($75), and I am also buying a bottle of the Spice Tree Extravaganza ($140) that blends in some older whiskies.  The spicy power of French oak is on full display with Spice Tree, and I am in awe.  I want more.  MARK: 90/100."

I love honey almost as much as the next bear and vanilla is my favorite milkshake..both of which american oak imparts in spades (well depending how many times its been refilled but not let's get pedantic..). European oak though hmmm...lovely lovely spice, toffee orange or is it caramel..hmm. 2, 3 and then now a 4 rating in my compass box journey.

4.0,"In true poetic fashion, a few well placed drops brings The Spice Tree to life.

There’s no doubt this one has a lot of branches to ponder. On the nose you’ll be greeted with lush caramel, almond, and an almost specter-like brine. Those drops then usher in vanilla, brown sugar, and deep sweet tones. 

On the tongue, there’s some bite behind that beautiful label. You may find black pepper and a spicy, kind burn. It’s staggering how long the heat stays while your palate dries out. That’s all accompanied by a dry nut finish.

Truth be told, The Spice Tree isn’t for everyone. However, if you want a daring dram with some robust character, this will meet the need and then some.

On the nose there is a light, delicate layer of honey, together with citrus peel, cloves, cinnamon and a strong oak note. It smells a lot sweeter than it tastes, but that is not a bad thing. The taste starts with some oranges and cinnamon, heavy cream with spices in it (oak, cloves....dash of pepper). No real sweetness, but to be fair, if I want sweet, bourbon, rum or sherry scotch it is. It's called spice tree after all, not sugar tree. The aftertaste stays very, very long, is quite creamy and bitter, with a very satisfying oak base layer. Now, I'm gonna finish this dram, and then I'm going on to the next one..Hedonism.

4.0,"This is the best whisky that I've tried in the last few weeks, by a fair margin.  Compass Box's mid-range blends don't always do it for me -- I was not a big fan of Peat Monster, despite revering Islay scotches in general.  But this is a bewitching scotch.  Its aromas don't adequately herald the complexity that eventually arrives on the palate:  I mainly get cherry, honey, and oak in nice balance, but not too much else.  Then I take a sip and find myself struggling to identify all of the discrete flavors.  There's an unexpectedly fruity entry of apricot and other fresh fruit, including both orchard and citrus varieties, an ale-like maltiness at its center, and then a whorl of spices including fennel, cinnamon, and anise.  This scotch fades in a medium-length finish of anise syrup and lingering sweetness.  The nose and finish don't entirely live up to the palate, but I'd recommend this to anyone who likes sweet and spicy flavors."

4.0,"Review from Barreled from November 2016

Part three of the Compass Box Whisky sampler pack reviews. 

This blended malt scotch is a NAS that is non chill filtered and natural color. It weighs in at 46% ABV and has a burnt orange/amber color. 

According the to information provided by CBW in the box, this appears to have the same spirit composition as their Oak Cross. They are also using hybrid oak casks like Oak Cross, but a different proportion of oak varieties and at a heavier char level. 

Toasted oak is the initial offering on the nose. Vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon are there in spades. Some ginger and butterscotch as well. There is definite brown sugar/molasses and some orange peel. I also got a hint of grilled bananas or banana chips. A very well balanced nose; rich, round and sweet. 

To me, the palate is not as well balanced, more spice than sweet but with a name like Spice Tree I'm not surprised. Clove, nutmeg and some vanilla.   There is definitely a sweetness, but the spices are so overpowering for me that I can't seem to pick out individual fruity or sweet flavors. Still very enjoyable though. 

Slightly oily and even a waxy mouthfeel. 

The finish is medium in length but the spices do linger and turn sweet with a slight cocoa aftertaste. 

Overall I think this is better than the Oak Cross, but not by a huge margin. I get the impression that if the Macallan 12 YO was matured in anything other than sherry casks it would be similar to The Spice Tree. I think this deserves a 4, but I'm going with 3.75 because I think it could use a bit more balance on the palate. Still a winner though!  Cheers"
5.0,"The Bottle: Compass Box has always excelled in this area, and The Spice Tree is no different.  This is an elegant and artistic label that not only looks great on the bar, it would make for a fantastic poster as well.  In addition to the artwork, there is a load of history and tasting notes on the label, all very good stuff.  They nicely tell you that the spirit is natural color and non-chill filtered.  Couple this with the 46% ABV, and we're in business. 
Further, if you were to go to their website you can get a really good sense of what the spirit blend is that makes it into the bottle.   
 
In the Glass: Light gold.  All of the color on this comes from the wood in which the spirit was matured. 
 
On the Nose: Notes of cinnamon, clove and apple right-off-the-bat.  Barley sugar and oak are laced into the back-drop with what one would generally describe as ""wood spice"".  This stuff is incredibly inviting.  I've often seen peated whiskies described as being ""autumnal"" in nature, and I get that...but The Spice Tree shows that there is another way.  There is as great a sense of fireplaces, grey skies and fallen leaves with this dram as anything you will find from Islay.     
  
Taste: Right from the arrival, you get a full-bodied and flavor-packed experience.  Baking spices and barley sweetness from the onset that develop into complex flavors reminiscent of a toffee pudding.  The finish has the flavor of dried apple slices with a pronounced dryness.  At 46% I do recommend adding a few drops of water and giving it a few minutes to open up in the glass, your patience will be greatly rewarded.
 
End-to-End, this is a fantastic whisky.  If you are on-the-fence about trying a blended malt, please don't hesitate to try this.  Compass Box consistently shows the kind of complexity and balance that one can get when you take the time to artistically blend individual malts and mature them in high-quality barrels."

4.0,"It’s late on a Saturday evening.  House is still. Listening to the Beatles (ahh, The Beatles) countdown on my stereo (in the top 30 now). I picked this Spice Tree up while in Maryland and at an attractive price (I have seen the price of this all over the map from store to store).  Intriguing packaging, as Compass Box always seem to create.  But it’s about the whisky, not the packaging that matters. 

The opening on the nose is cloyingly sweet with the subtle current of baking spices: cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom.  The subtle sweetness is comprised of ripe Granny Smith apples, vanilla, butterscotch and bakers chocolate. There is a mild earthiness of dried, fallen leaves on a warm October. Some old, worn leather or suede. A touch of salted mixed nuts weaves through. A very well balanced and inviting nose. 

The palate is sweet and spicy; an embodiment of the nose.  The sweetness is initially more detectable than the spice, but marginally so.  Butterscotch, vanilla, caramel, toasted marshmallows are the sweet notes.  Those sweet notes rapidly shift to the spicy side (of course): cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves. The mouthfeel is slightly dense and mildly oily.  A drop or two of water soften the slight jagged borders and brings forth more orange rind and ginger ale. 

As the palate fades, what remains are slight hints of oak, orange bitters ginger, black pepper.  Semisweet chocolate notes finishes the fade and the mouth is ultimately left with some oak and spearmint. 

Compass Box/John Glaser & company are masterful blenders.  The Spice Tree is expertly balanced between spice and sweetness; one sensation never overpowering the other.  A perfect late autumn sipper when the air is crisp, the leaves are sienna and crimson and scattered about.  Another great blend (better than most single malts) from the one of the best blenders.

4.0,"Wonderful Highland nose, arrival delivered everything the nose promised and the finish was lingering and lovely. I have only sampled a few blended malts, and this one is a stunner. The high ratings are well deserved."
5.0,"I'll start off by saying this is an awesome blend, very well balanced, with complex flavors, but nothing overpowers. It is a playful whisky. The nose is honey and heather, mixed with black pepper, cloves and cinnamon. This continues on the palate, but it is all supported by a lovely undertone of vanilla cream, in the end clove and cinnamon chocolate caramel arrives on the tongue and continues through the finish, which lingers. I think this is great anytime but would be perfect for Christmas.  The price is how much it costs in Sweden."

4.0,"The appeal of this blended Scotch comes down to two things: your thoughts on cinnamon and, quite simply, your tolerance of the idea that a blended malt can be exceptional. Single malt snobs need not apply, but if you can appreciate a blended malt, that is a whisky Blended exclusively of single malts, 3 in this case, all terrific in their own right, then you will probably love this. Great presentation at 46% and no color added. Nose is very herbal with hints of vanilla and oak between the sharp tinge of the spirit. It benefits from a teaspoon of water, which tames the cinnamon slightly, but be careful as it drowns easily. Pallette consists of an explosion of cinnamon upfront melding into vanilla and sharp oak, gram cracker, pepper with a satisfying finish that seems to linger longer than you would expect. I love this whisky but I have to be in the mood for it. Cinnamon is so abundant, that you must be a fan, or like me, someone who appreciates it at times. Overall, a great spirit and highly recommended."

OVERALL: Incredible mouth feel, and hits all the right notes if you’re looking for full-bodied whisky that tastes as good as it smells. Has to be one of the best whiskies for your money!"

A bit of fruit on the nose, but more honey & vanilla on the palate - so probably closer to a Highland rather than an Irish as some have suggested, as there’s not much of that deep fruitiness you get with a decent Irish. Bloody good all up, but stylistically not what I’d typically  go for, tbh"

5.0,"Once in a while I get asked, “If you were stuck on a deserted island and you could have just one of whatever, what would it be?” Sometimes it refers to music or people but recently someone asked me that about whisky. 

After some semi-sober thought, I’ve concluded that if I could only drink Compass Box whisky the rest of my life, well, that wouldn’t be such a bad thing. 

I like people who upset the status quo. It’s the only way that progress happens, and what John Glaser and CBW have done, particularly with Spice Tree proves just that. 

The nose is complex, with layers of oak from the different woods in the custom casks. This is not a sipper. This is a thinking whisky. As you let the whisky sit on your palate a while, you get hints of allspice, nutmeg, cloves, and a whisp of honey. This would be the ubiquitous “spice” in spice tree, as the alcohol burn is relatively minimal. Very little sweetness to this dram, but lots of flavor. You get more oak that comes in waves on the very long finish, and it sticks with you long enough to make you ponder what’s truly important in life. 

A remarkable whisky, and I salute the lads at CBW for taking a chance, (briefly) braking the law, and create something truly unique and trailblazing. Highest marks!"

5.0,Tastes of citrus fruits and spices take center stage in this. Very smooth with just enough smoke to cut the sweetness and add an interesting finish. Solid choice for someone who drinks bourbon more often than scotch.
4.5,"My generous, bourbon-drinking brother sent me this as a gift just before Christmas.  It didn't last me very long. Extremely easy to drink. Think roasted as in walnuts. An excellent blended malt. Kind of like a pecan pie. Maybe some egg nog. The closest thing to bourbon, but still tastes very much like scotch. In fact, this would be a great one to get bourbon drinkers introduced to scotch. Don't worry if you don't like Bourbon. You will still like this. I agree with the flavor profile. Also, don't worry if you don't like the idea of ""spice"".. I never considered buying this for myself because I was worried about the name spice. Thought it meant clove, cinnamon, etc.. It's nothing like that. It is Very balanced and enjoyable and I think the fact my brother bought it for me, who happens to like Bourbon, is just a coincidence."

Nose: So much here it seems impossible. Pears, apples, orange, slight cranberry, cinnamon, sweet cream, nutmeg, all spice, cloves. It’s like walking into your parents house 3 hours before thanksgiving dinner. 

Taste: As the title suggests, so many spices right off the bat. Sweet apples and cream lead into cinnamon brown sugar. Mid pallet has a lot of buttery puff pastry taste. The fruits linger on the finish. Orange and lemon zest, along with savory butter and allspice berries. 

Going to hang on to this bottle for the remainder of the year so that I have enough for the holidays. Hats off once again Compass Box."

4.5,Quite enjoyed this! Has great oaky notes with a carmelized banana finish
4.0,"I cannot think of any whisky more appropriately named. The spice tree delivers spice, spice, and more spice. 

The nose is, as you’d expect, full of spices. If your mother dropped her spice rack on the floor and broke all the containers, I’d imagine it would have a similar fragrance. The dominate aromas are clove and cinnamon. 

The palate is spicy and complex with ginger taking over the dominate flavor. There is some toffee behind those spices. A few drops of water open up those complex flavors making them more palatable. 

The finish is long with orange peel and pepper on your tongue. This scotch will clear up your sinuses. 

This is a great scotch but be warned, it may not be for beginners. Some scotches are peat monsters, but this is a spice monster!

It’s also worth noting, the bottle has some great artwork which blends beautifully with the color of the whisky. Very good looking bottle."

3.75,"About time for another Compass Box, everyone’s favorite innovative blender of Scotch whisky. Spice Tree is arguably the gem of the core range with its unique profile and well documented history. This bottle gets top Compass Box billing from me in the winter months while the Great King St Artist Blend is my summertime jam.

The nice deep amber color reveals a nose of brown sugar, orange peel, and dusty library books...an odd combo but rather enticing. True to its name, the spice dominates the taste and finish with cinnamon, cloves, cider, oak, and holiday memories.

Rating: 94 from Distiller puts this in the ultra top shelf category but I’m leaning high 80s. This bottle started out as an easy 4.5 stars but surprisingly grew less interesting to me after multiple pours and the seasons changed. Still a solid 3.75 stars and a no brainer for any whisky shelf.

You really need to like oak to enjoy this one because it has a strong presence. I like this profile; when done right it can result in a fun, playful whiskey. It reminds me a lot of the wood influence you get on PNW American Single Malts (Westland, Westward, Wanderback, etc), which I believe all use Oregon White Oak.

1.5,"A sample as part of the ""Whiskey Transfer Program"" from dthom.  I really wanted to like this. 

Nose: Light vanilla, musty wood, toasted bread, grapefruit, stewed apricot, lemon peel, mint, black pepper, caramelized sugars, and some ethanol bite.  This is VERY complex on the nose.  Too complex maybe.  There is sort of a background funk that I don't really care for.

Taste: Very sweet initially with stewed stone fruits like peaches, apricots, and nectarines but without the acid. Fades fast though right in to the finish.

Finish: I kind of hate the finish on this.  It's so many overwhelming confusing flavors that I can't get my head around it.  Cloves, cinnamon, heavy cardamom, fennel, black pepper, nutmeg, and some orange peel as well.

This is just too complex.  What I mean is that there are too many flavors going on and it's muddy and confusing.  I like when a whiskey has clear flavors and intent and purpose and this seems like it's just going too many different directions. Sorry Compass Box but this one doesn't work for me."
4.25,"I had high hopes for this one and was not disappointed.  The nose is wonderfully strong, with orange cream, fruit and spice most prominent.  The palate is similar, with nice oak (unusually nice, perhaps the American/French mix?). The finish is fairly long, with a very mild cocao note.  I tried this with a 1 ounce sample.

I like this one a lot."
4.25,"So this sample took a really long route to get to me to finally taste! This was originally included in a sample pack I had received from the great @Scott_E! When I received that sample pack I was only expecting 5 samples, the same # I had sent the other way. So after finding 5 samples I stopped looking thru the package. I then utilized the same box to send my blind sample package over to my buddy @Neveruseice. As he is unpacking it on his end he inquires as to what this sample is and sends a picture of this sample, in addition to the 4 blinds I had sent him! So this one came all the way from NJ to AZ to CA and now back to AZ! I think we can now say this had additional UPS finishing 🤣! So let's see if it was worth the long journey!
On the palatte it's very rich and fruity! Lots of dried fruit notes, caramel and graham crackers are the initial notes. Mid palatte introduces cocoa, honey and lots of oak spices. Very different from rye whiskey spice, but lovely in its own right. The finish is medium with more oak, honey dipped fruits and a juicy fruit bubble gum note. 
Man this is a really well constructed blend. Balanced, nice body with a velvety feel. It's like big and more grown up brother to the Monkey Shoulder. 
If you are into robust highland malts, this would be right up your alley! 
Cheers again @Scott_E on yet another lovely sample! Cheers all and Happy Saturday!"

The alcohol content provides the right envelopment, well accompanied by the softness of the aromas, while the wood becomes an elegant suggestion. Shortbread in the background.

4.25,"Crazy, complicated, never stops morphing into another direction. Heavy vanilla on the nose, cinnamon and cloves up front, Caramel, pear on the finish. On the first round, very different on the second and then again on the third. Love it!"
4.0,"Compass Box creates some wonderful styles of whisky. Some may not be your or my favorite, but each is a masterpiece for what it is. This is a vatted malt consisting of Clynelish, Dailuaine, and Teaninich. This blend is aged in an assortment of standard and hybrid wood casks with varying degrees of toast to give a complex spiciness to the whisky. When first nosing the glass the first impression is of opening a spice box. In the mouth the spiciness is forward (ginger, mace, clove?). If you allow it to linger on the tongue an underlying sweet fruitiness is distinct. All of these are evident on the slow finish. At the very end there is a bit of astringency, I think from the French oak from the Vosges Mts. Overall a very solid blended malt Scotch."
4.25,"Glencairn, neat, rested 15 minutes, neck pour

Color: looks like scotch
Nose: sweet honey, almond, and orange peel
Palate: medium mouth feel with powerful cinnamon, allspice, orange peel, oak, and ginger.
Finish: honey fades to oak spice with some meaty notes almost like a honey baked ham.

Overall: I'm new to scotch and this is very exciting, I can't wait to try more from compass box"

3.5,"It has some fruit and is smooth. The spice is there, but does not completely dominate. The flavor is slightly creamy, but not so much. The drink had more depth than Glenfiddich 14 Bourbon Barrel, but less richness. It's very good, but keep in mind how cheap Glenfiddich 14 Bourbon Barrel is. This is fruitier drink, which is a reasonable comparison to make for a whiskey, but it is playing a slightly different game.
For the price, this is remarkably good. It compares favorably with Compass Box Spice Tree (though it does lose). The orange flowers and richness are good. There is a reasonable amount of depth too. The problem is that there is somewhat too much alcohol flavor present here. Surprisingly, it's a bit less sweet than Glenmorangie The Original, but it also has a bit less of an alcohol flavor and has some more richness. Overall, this is a clear winner over Glenmorangie The Original.
Furthermore, I would venture that this is on par with the Compass Box Hedonism, if not actually slightly better.
Somehow, this is richer and better than the Compass Box Hedonism. A bit spicy, but otherwise magnificent!
The key to its success is a combination of its depth and fullness of flavor.
There is a little bit of alcohol here, but the sweetness and spice overwhelm it. The flavor here is well developed and tasty throughout. There is a hint of creaminess too, but not much.
It's richer and spicier than the Glenfiddich 14 Bourbon Barrel, but the spice is a tad on the strong side for a Scotch. The flavor is fairly complex and quite drinkable. A bit less mildly mineral alcohol and some more complexity would be great, but this is good as it is.
It's surprising that this is better than the Hedonism. The spice goes well with the rye tartness and burn. There's plenty of vanilla and enough wood to form a respectable backing. The bits of cherry and orange are nice and refreshing. There's a bit of cereal, but it's minimal. There's a light brown sugar sweetness, but it isn't excessive. The sea spray is not too strong. The floral notes are kind of mineral and refreshing without being excessive. Some herbal bitterness makes its way in but it avoids being more than an accent to the smoke. It's kind of refreshing and a bit playful, but the flavor is still solid and balanced with minimal alcohol and a nice finish. This is a very good drink though it isn't super excellent. I'd be happy to sip this and the price is good, but there are definitely better options in the price range. The complexity of the Spice Tree outperforms that of Glenfiddich 14 Bourbon Barrel, but the Glenfiddich has better flavors.
The nose has some rye tartness mixed with some cinnamon and vanilla that gives it a bourbon character, though it also has a little bit of that dank scotch smell. There's a little red fruit and a little quinoa earthiness, but not too much. The palate is spicy and has some nice sweetness. It's a tad harsh and the rye tartness really does come through. This could pass as a really nice bourbon, though as a scotch it tastes rather young. There's some nice butterscotch and a bit of tangerine, but the complexity is not excellent. The vanilla does eventually come through in a substantial way, but it never overwhelms. This is a really solid start, but it tastes rather young and a tad sharp. Some of the scotch seaside character does come out, but it is not terribly aggressive. There's a little bit of a grassy note with how light this whole thing is. It doesn't have the rich sweet corn and vanilla sweetness of Evan Williams Black, but the flavor carries itself better toward the finish. For this price point, it's possible to do a lot better. I appreciate the richer flavor of Glenfiddich 14, though Glenfiddich 14 also comes with a fair bit of wet wood. I appreciate the good elements here, but that rye punch has too much alcohol and it just kind of overwhelms. It's still certainly a solid sipper though and it does succeed pretty well in its spice goal. It's a tough call between this and Glenfiddich 14. This has less of that underlying wet wood, but it's also lighter with more rye and alcohol. I'd probably give the win just barely to the Glenfiddich 14. This has a little bit of that Green Spot Irish whiskey nectar flavor and oily bitterness to it, but the Spice Tree has less of that bad Irish whiskey flavor and more balance."

3.5,"This was the only core expression from Compass Box that i haven't had before, and once again, Compass box dissapoints me a little. 

CBW is known for been ""the best blenders"" and the artist of blending, and even been ""the ones who make a better whisky by blending them"", but to this date, with the exception of peat monster and maybe one other expression i can't seem to remember now (and that says a lot about it), i really haven't had a spectacular compass box whisky. Don't get me wrong, they are fine, better than most blends, but they sure are not as wonderful as their fame says. 

This one, was bottled at 46%abv.

On the nose, fresh field notes, grapes, lemon and acetone. 

On the palate, prunes, ashes, lemon, citric, and some peat. 

Not spicy, but ashy, which can be consider as a spice... at least for my palate it is.

Finish is very short, lots of points were deducted there.

Overall i give this dram a 74/100 and i don't think it is bad, but it is nothing to die for."
