4.0,"This stuff is just magic. It's a must try for any Aussie whisky enthusiast.  Unfortunately the inflated price is hard to swallow, hence only 4 stars."

5.0,"I have to admit this is one of my most anticipated whiskies I’ve been waiting to try, and it didn’t disappoint.  Rich, spicy, fruity and full bodied it was like getting hit with a train full of flavors! The finish…. just didn’t finish! At only 15 years, this whisky has an amazing amount of character and depth which I can see why this whisky is so popular! I At 47.5% alcohol volume it does pack a punch and maybe a drop or two of water is recommended for some people."
5.0,"I liken this to an angry Highland single malt.  Where a Highland might be restrained, this is just in your face with bold flavors.  You owe it to yourself to at least try it."

5.0,Almost technically perfect. The finish lingers for weeks. Sharply focussed like a lazerbeam.

5.0,"Rich, full and bold and simply Australian. There is wonderful caramel and spice topped by Christmas pudding. Had batch TD 0113 at the distillery (21/4/18) and if the double oak is breakfast and the American oak is lunch this skips dinner and goes straight to dessert. I still have a bottle of HH 0376 waiting to be opened on a special day can’t wait"
