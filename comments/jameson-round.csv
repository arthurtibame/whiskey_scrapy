4.5,"I am not a fan of most irish whiskies, and i never expected this dram to be THAT GOOD. Well, this was amazing, it gave me a wonderful experience tasting it, and before talking deep about it, i can tell you right now: you should buy this whiskey. 

Jameson Round belongs to the ""Deconstructed series"" which was a project to separate the parts in a normal Jameson to enhance them individually and sell you three different whiskies that together construct the Jameson ""DNA"".

This one is called ""Round"", the other two are called ""Lively"" and ""Bold"", defining the key characteristics of this distillery.

Bottled at 40%abv, light gold color.

On the nose this is really a sweet, perfumed dram. My first sniff on it made me think i was not going to like it because i got a creamy vanilla from grain whiskies. Then a nice chocolate note with infused caramel. Sider, very perfumed. Red apple notes are all over the place. Apple juice. Some red fruits. Very perfumed after a couple of minutes, very floral aroma. There is some oiliness to it. The spiciness on the nose is rather sweet and fresh like ginger. Nice aroma. Vanilla so sweet. Butter.

On the palate, it is very easy to drink and friendly. Yellow and red apples, very fruity, very fresh. Ginger spice, pleasant. The most accurate apple flavor ever found in a whiskey. Very easy to drink, actually very ROUND. Delicious.

And now... the best part. The aftertaste:

WOW AFTERTASTE WAS FANTASTIC. Nice experience. Let me tell you this, its like milk powder; or froot loops powder (debris) that naturally appears after pouring it. Incredible. Its just a different experience. It is the most accurately way to describe it. 

Overall this was a surprising, beautiful dram. I hope the other two live to my new expectations of them. 93 over 100. Sláinte!"
