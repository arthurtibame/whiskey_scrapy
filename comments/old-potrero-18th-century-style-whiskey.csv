3.5,Interesting cross between a scotch and a rye. Super creamy mouthfeel. A drop or two of water adds more zest and herbal notes. 3.6.
3.5,"This one is quite unique. Not really like anything I've had previously. The best way to describe it is a spicy single malt. Upfront it's sweet. You get classic malt notes of honeydew, honeysuckle and a hint of cereal. It moves to a big spicy rye driven finish that is pretty long. Some oak as well. Not terribly complex but very pleasant. A tad overpriced, but I am at a steakhouse in NYC so I guess that goes with the territory!"
2.0,Too much cinnamon Tastes like a classy fireball

3.0,More woody than the Rye
4.0,I took a swig of this and the ghost of my great grandfather appeared. He told me to get a real job and actually contribute something to this earth. I tried to explain to him how the tech economy has redefined the economic landscape but he just finished my whiskey while I was distracted. He then cast one last lecherous look at our ethnically diverse waitress before cackling and vanishing in an aracne haze. 4 stars.

null,"Due to the barrel parameters, this whiskey does not have the flavors I prefer.  It is very herbal/grassy, the spice is hot as expected from such a young rye.  I can't quite put my finger on the finishing taste, but it reminds me of very young and very cheap, minimal peat Scotch."
3.0,"Cocoa aroma. Woodiness. Colonial tasting, does it's job of reminiscing. Nice long surprisingly calm finish. I like it better than HW double rye"
1.0,"Tastes like an orange liquor to me. Anchor Steam is my favorite brewery so I feel a little let down. It hardly tastes like a whiskey. Unique and odd for sure. Overly herbal and just not my thing. Will not restock this bottle.

5.0,"Let sit for ~a minute. No water/ice.

👀: Soft golden-orange hues, has quite a bit of tears;

👃: Immediate baking spices, orange zest, maple syrup;

👅: Creamy, spicy, nutty notes on the back end;

🏁: Smooth finish, lingering, beautiful."

3.5,"This whiskey has a light golden hue with thin viscous legs.

The nose is herbal and green and complex with notes of cinnamon toast, basil, oregano, Italian seasoning, green pine, wood freshly placed on a fire, dry straw, sawdust, and strangely enough, Play-Doh.

The palate has an oily mouthfeel with notes of milk chocolate, cinnamon, rye spice, fennel, and melted butter.

The finish is long with citrus and spice sending you off. Cheers!"

3.25,"This is its own thing. Smells weird - salty or meaty or B. O. or sawdust. Tastes like a mixed cocktail with bitters, maybe citrus, spice, etc."
2.0,"There's an off-putting note on the nose that I really don't like. The taste is a little spicy, but the unpleasantness comes back on the finish and lingers. I can't recommend."
