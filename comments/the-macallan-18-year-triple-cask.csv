5.0,"Light, clean, and can pack a slow but surprising wallop. 
This bottle turned me around on Scotch, whiskey and bourbon! Now I'm trying them all. But still my favorite. 
Always make sure your first taste is free. That way you don't think about the cost, end you'll be hooked."
4.0,"Nose - Dark apple juice, candied citrus peels, candied ginger, golden raisins

Taste - Rich caramel, ginger spice, golden raisins, all on a backbone of dark filtered apple cider & caramel sauce, orange zest, light milk chocolate

Finish - Light apple skin bitter, ginger spice, golden raisins sweet

Score - 83/100

Final Thoughts - So the nose on this one wasn't quite as good as the 18 fine oak, but it was fairly complex. I imagine a table with a bunch of dried fruits & nuts arranged together to represent this. Dried apple rings, apricots, golden raisins, candied ginger, candied citrus peels, Turkish delight. All of these things are captured in this dram in one form or another. It's pleasant for sure, but nothing really screams outstanding. It's very pleasant, feels like I need to have a charcuterie tray with nuts & dried fruits to pair this with and that's its sole purpose.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"
