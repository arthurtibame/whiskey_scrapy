3.5,"Nose - sharp, acidic, light oak tannin, some citrus and some more sweet notes. I get almost a sugar cane and springbank combo here. There's not a lot of depth or complexity to the nose. It is pleasant but not inviting.


Taste - Upfront I get those bannanas and pineapples and just that kinda rum citrus fruit note. Of course we get some salt, light peat, and a bit of a funky malt. There isn't a lot on the opening here either. But then the whisky transitions and I get notes of espresso (like a kona blend), some deep well aged and well made oak, light white chocolate, perhaps even a cinnamon roll icing. 

The overall experience is from sweet and light to complex and dark oak and espresso notes. All within that classic springbank funk and earthy expression. This is HIGHLY complex whisky and insanely nuanced. 

I'm sadly only going with a 3.5 as I can't get past how simple and frankly poor the nose is. This is a 2.0 nose on a 4.0 whisky. So we'll split the difference."

The nose was full of mint, spearmint, basil, and pine needles.  On the back end were citrus fruit like lemons and oranges, along with some tropical notes like pineapple and coconut.

For the palate, we get caramel, dark chocolate, buttered popcorn, white pepper, all supported by a foundation of white ashy peat smoke.

The finish is long, filled with espresso, mocha, toffee, and honey tones.  Wow! What an overall complex, yet approachable scotch. The only ""complaint"" that I can see one can put on this bottle is the feeling of it being quite disjointed. When you pick a 5 course meal, you do want to there to be a flow, in which here the nose and palate are separate. With that said though, the quality of each piece here is exquisite. The cost of the try is a bit much, but remember the true artisan experience from Springbank you are experiencing. 

The theme of this dram should also be a little haphazard in tone, but be a quality work. ""Cirkus"" by King Crimson, it is."
