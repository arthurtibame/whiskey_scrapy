4.5,"The first pour of this I was disappointed, there were no significant notes of any specific flavor or spice that I could pick up. 

However as I have had more of it I have found love for how unique it is.

This release is so smooth and clean, but in regards to flavor, all I can say is it taste like whiskey. Just whiskey to it's core. Pure, smooth whiskey. Nothing else, and that in itself is truly an accomplishment.

My favorite use of this whiskey is to make a old fashioned, which when using this pour they are typically especially delicious."
