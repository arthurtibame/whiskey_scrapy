4.0,"Purchased at $82.99. Double the old price but I think that's for good reason. Sweet, vanilla and almond notes on the nose that flirts a little with oak. Very smooth all the way down. At $100 I'd pass but around $80 is a good buy."

4.0,"bought for $100 at Spec's in Texas . . . purportedly a ""dusty,"" but unsure how long it was held. Although the price is unnecessarily high, this is a fine rye. It has a finesse to it that Willet rye lacks. There is not the complexity one would expect for such a price point, but the after taste is superb, leaving a continuing balanced vanilla, oak, pepper linger. Taste is subjective, but rating this product 1 star seems excessive and likely born of spite for the high price. Given the lack of any clear age and the high price I cannot say I'd buy again, but it's hard to imagine a day I'd pass up a dram of this rye."

The older age-stated sourced bourbons/ryes whose coattails' this one is hitched to? Sure, maybe. But certainly not what is in this bottle. p.s. this tastes like wet cardboard."

    I've had 3 different tastings so far notwithstanding the misfortune of buying my own bottle during a drunken stupor. I honestly never knew what 'bad whisky' tasted like before buying this bottle. BMHO Rye  is  practically rancid - that's the flavor profile I get. 
    
    There's an entire library of options I'd recommend before this one. Caveat emptor all the way here guys"

1.0,"Do not buy this stuff.  It is a complete trick.  They have changed the source of the bourbon and rye to some small craft outfit in Oregon.  This is a just a craft rye spirit and there is MUCH better product a MUCH lower price (e.g. Few Spirits Rye).  I am so mad that I paid $100 for this bottle.  Tasting notes:
1. Nose is floral/herbacious and alcohol
2. Taste is basically alcohol and florbal/herbs
3. Body is thin, finish is somewhat spicy but goes away quickly after the alcohol taste leaves

Really disappointed at the trick this company is trying to play with their bourbon and rye. Again, do not be tempted by the ""limited release"" on the label and the stores across the U.S. that put this out as if it is some sort of highly coveted, rare masterpiece.  It is not, spend your money on something way better.  I wouldn't even recommend this at $50, it would have to be $25-$30 so I didn't feel ridiculous just making manhattans and sazeracs with it."

4.0,"Twelve years ago, I had my honeymoon in Tahiti.  We stayed in one of those over water bungalows in Moorea, with immaculately beautiful water.  Ever since that honeymoon, any other beach doesn't even come close for me.  I've been spoiled.  If High West Midwinter is my Moorea over water, then this is my all-other beach vacation.  I'm sure it's great, but doesn't compare to High West Midwinter.   Amanda's notes are spot on---this is definately well balanced and complex.  And if I weren't forever spoiled by Midwinter, I'd probably have had this rated higher."

4.0,"The spice is forward with a caramel and fruit finish.  It is very tasty. ""Holy Grail"" of rye??? Like Willet 6yr better."
4.0,"Wasn't quite sold on this at first. The review seemed so over the top. I wasnt sold after the first glass, but keeping an open mind, I went back. One thing I did notice, this rye opens up nicely with a cube or two, or perhaps a small splash of water. Though its only 95 proof, the wiskey seems ""busy"". The water or ice seems to calm everything down, and put everything in its place, flavor profile wise. They become more refined and pronunced. From there it is quite enjoyable, still not a 98, but could justify a 93-95. I read that some revierws made comments about ""sitting on the shelf"" or ""dust on the bottle"". Dont be fooled , black maple hill is not marketed to the general public like some whiskies, hence some of the public is uneducated to them. This causes them to get overlooked sometimes for a more marketable brand. I remember at one point I used to see Egale Rares in liquor stores with dust on them, untill the public became educated."

2.5,"American whiskey tasting evening, Sydney, 21 September 18. Whiskey #2

Nose: Bright gingery spices and a musky syrup note. A hint of leather and pepper.
    
    Palate: Dry molasses and spices – powdered ginger, nutmeg, paprika and clove. Quite a forceful arrival, a little thin but not particularly hot. In the background, when tasted neat, there was a combination of herbs, brine, pickles and cheese – a bit like spiced feta. Not disagreeable, but a bit weird. The addition of a little water smoothed and developed the palate remarkably by developing some sweetness to balance the pickles.
    
    Finish: Medium. Dusty and woody spices.
    
    Overall this whiskey had a warming character rather than a hot one. The texture, although a little thin, was chewy and satisfying.
    
    The main problem I had with it was how it collapsed quickly in the glass. You encounter this sometimes – a whisky will be OK on first nosing but when you leave it to develop in the glass instead of improving it goes downhill.  In this case when neat the nose seemed to close down and lose impact over time, while the palate became more obviously briny.
    
    Adding water made this even worse. Initially water killed the nose but greatly improved the palate by bringing out sweet notes, but over the next 30 minutes the whole profile fell apart with both the nose and taste eventually seeming stale and a bit like wet cardboard.
    
    It’s drinkable and quirky, but I wouldn’t call it “good” - it’s average at best and I’d recommend using it as a mixer. However at the excessively high asking price there is really no way I'd recommend this whisky at all.
    
    “Average” : 2.5 stars"

4.0,When I first opened this a year ago I thought it was straight whack. Visited again tonight with a more sophisticated pallet and I really enjoy it. Sweet rye flavor. Drinks hotter than the 95proof. The oak is a definitely recognizable. I will now offer this to guests as my favorite rye at the moment.

Grassy... or could also be described as piney or sappy!  A little like lemon grass and green tea with a sweet tea (boiled white sugar) sweetness.

I've decided I like this although it's probably not worth the price.  I imagine it's not for everyone.  

I suspect I could make an amazing cocktail with this mixed into sweetened iced green tea or black tea with a touch of mint."

Forward: Coconut Water. Earthy, Grassy. Reminds me of Bailing Hay w/o the hangover. Brite.

I would not buy a bottle, but I'm glad I tried it. It's unique. Mellow throughout, delicate upfront, with a little rye chew at the end."

4.25,"A unique, spicy pour that tastes like peppery, grassy, green tea.  A little thin-bodied but full of punch. 

Last time, I had this in a bar and was the last pour in the bottle, but now I own it and it tastes like I remember (+1 for consistency)

I can see how this might be devisive - it's practically distilled lawn clippings.  I like this because I can't find anything quite like it.  When I'm in a certain mood, I really enjoy this. 

If you only have room in your palate for dark, deep ryes like something from Willet Family Estate, then this isn't for you, but if you're curious and into something atypical then give this a chance"
