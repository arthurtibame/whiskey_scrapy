3.25,"This was recommended by my local shopkeeper based on his acquaintance with the brand owner so I figured at $35 it was with a gamble. Nose is light and buttery. First sip follows suit with a light complexity of almonds and butter. The dram is very smooth and light with almost no burn at all. Do I love this? No, but it would be a nice entry point to Irish Whiskey for a newbie. Worth the $35, but not much more."
