Beautiful, a lot of the peat is gone at this age and what is left is a hint of peat and lots of beautiful slightly smoky, rich whisky. Yum"

5.0,"Strong, easy to overpower the nose if you inhale too closely. Orange, apricot, and wood on the nose, some charred wood sweetness on the tongue. Benefits from a little dilution, brings out vanilla and makes it an easier sip."
5.0,So far the best dram I've ever tasted. We finished a bottle in a single sitting. The smoke is so well balanced with the sweetness and a hint of brine. Perfect if you are a peat lover
5.0,"More subtle peat notes than the younger Taliskers. Soft honey, caramel, bright oak, sea breeze on the nose. The palate is warm and enveloping, the honey and oak shine while hints of pear, oak, and vanilla shine through before a welcome subtle smoke and peat round it out. One of the best scotches I've had the pleasure of tasting."

3.0,"Serving as a runner-up to Neist Point, the 25 manifests notes of firewood smoke, slight honey, sweetness, peat moss, brine, and pepper. Get ready for a surprising amount of fire for a 25 year old whisky!"
4.0,"Ordered a sample of this from masters of malt. Did not want to pay 300+$ to find out if I liked this or not.

This whiskey really through me for a loop. I love Talikser. Talisker 10 is one of my favorite peated Scotches. It's a nice light peat, infused with that salty brine that really makes it wonderful. I've had Talisker 10 and Storm( many of both in fact) and was sure that 25 should be a similar experience, just taken to the next level. Let's get on to my notes for the truth of the thing:

Nose: Glue(paste), Green Banana, Musty, Light Tangerine, Light pepper w/ time, and finally towards the end spicy bbq'd baby back ribs. 

Taste: sweet melon! kelp salt, rainbow sherbert icecream! Where's the peat?! Mouthfeel is light, on the watery side, but powerful flavor.

Finish: Cantelope! Shortish in length. 

I am really torn with this whiskey. In many respects, it is a good dram! However, I was expecting classic Talisker and this is a completely different beast. So much unexpected fruit. It's like they traded the peat/smoke for fruit. 

It was a fun tasting experience, but I would not want to pay 300$ for this. I know of far more interesting dram's that can be had for under 100$ a bottle. I understand that this is 25 years old and it is hard to hold on to that kind of stock, but this is simply not worth the price tag.

I recommend getting a sample, and trying. Maybe for some out there, this will be worth the price of a full bottle."

3.5,"The review on One Man's Malt site sums it up very nicely for me I reckon. To paraphrase from my viewpoint: firey pepper, lemon, orange, lemon, grapefruit, woody bitterness. Missing the richness of the 10, which means unlike its younger brother not one you want to swirl round and round your mouth. Feels like it's been in wood a bit to long imparting quite a more intense bitter dryness. Hard to rate this one especially as I've found with Taliskers' you often need a bottle to open up over time to get the most of it which a sample doesn't give you. The rating of the 10 year for me shot up from 1st to 2nd tasting (a week later). I have to rate on what I've got however. It grew on me but I prefer the less than 1/4 of the cost younger brother. 3.25 rating and at nearly $300USD a bottle its not VFM."

4.0,"I'm not sure about the release year. The one I tried was released in 2011 and was showing amazing light white flowers aromas. Before the soft peatiness of course. Very delicate somehow, but absolutely remarquable. The 35yo is far better for the complexity it offers, but this one is already a winner, and also a good price for the quality."

5.0,"Excellent dram, medium level peat mixed with amazing smoky sea oak flavour."
4.25,"I’m going outside my one dram / week by having this special 25 yr Talisker tonight.  My birthday, so with every passing year it’s a celebration to be alive, with a great family and a relatively decent life.  I’ve made it a point to have a top shelf whisky every birthday; as we get older it’s due time to reflect on all the things for which to be thankful.  This one comes courtesy of @LeeEvolved.  A quarter century Talisker, about as top shelf as you can get.  I think this is the 2015 version.  The nose is impressive: salted caramels, some brine.  Actually...I’m getting mostly all salted caramels, can’t ask for a better nose.  Taste  takes the salted caramels down a notch, and the brine comes out more.  It’s much more elegant and refined version of the 10, and even the 18 for that matter.  Truthfully I expected more elegance.  My benchmark for the two over 20 yr olds has been the Hibiki 21 and Macallan 25.  Both had that silkiness that this lacked.   But, I’m nitpicking at this point.  Still a damn good dram."

5.0,"The 45.8% ABV bottling from 2011

My starter for my birthday weekend in DC, which will feature ridiculous pours and bottles. This was at Minibar, where they gave me the rest of the bottle, which halfway filled up the Glencairn. We will call it a generous 3 ounces. 

Sipping on this during a 2 Michelin starred 20 course tasting menu is unfair, but this dram held its own. Not as complex as the food, but it was actually a very good complement to many dishes that were briny and gamey. 

The best way to describe this is if they turned the ocean into silk. All of the aggression from the 10 year old that was refined in the 18 year old is now completely subdued in the 25. Because it’s not trying to slap you in the face, you can focus on the layers of complexity. 

Thick brined fruitiness on the nose. Grapefruits, mandarins, pears, peaches. Lightly floral. On the palate, just layers of gentle ocean flavors and fruits that are perfectly blended into one another. Seaweed, kelp, rope, iodine, and still a little antiseptic medicinal peat, but so well rounded. Buttery, silky, with gentle honey, oak, spices, and that medicinal peat on the finish. 

My wife, who loves Macallan, and ordered a pour from some Macallan diamond earring cask, denounced Macallan in front of everyone and declared Talisker her favorite after trying this. 

Great! Time to buy this bottle, and a bottle of the even better 1985 maritime edition.

2.0,Tasted like drinking a campfire. Had the same burn too. The smell was powerful enough to hit my nose when I wasn't even trying to sniff it. I was not ready for this.

4.5,"Herby, brine/smoked meat aromas with a bit of vanilla sweetness. 

Excellent mouthfeel, not oily but thick. 

Equal parts buttery, caramel cookie and strong pepper. The two are very separate. Super interesting. 

Finish is fast and fiery."
2.75,"Nose - Sweet briny smoke, salt & pepper on smoked kelp, dried persimmons, spicy oak

Taste - Salty drying sweet charcoal smoke, white pepper tingle, salty dried persimmon sweet, light oaky bitterness, hint of lemon zest, lightly medicinal/metallic

Finish - Long lingering smoky salt, light medicinal/metallic sweet, light salty white pepper tingle/heat

Score - 75/100

Final Thoughts - I guess I'm not really a fan of this older expression. It sort of had the ""depth"" & ""age"" vibe, but it was all sorts of flavors that were a bit off-putting to me. The smoke was subtle enough, but still quite present even after 25 years in oak. The sweetness was a bit tough to pinpoint, but it reminded me of dried persimmons, which I'm not a huge fan of. There was this medicinal/metallic vibe that I sometimes get from dried fruits that are a bit old. This was interesting as I think I seem to enjoy younger, finished Taliskers better.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

4.25,Ok I'm doing something I very very rarely do (in fact I'm pretty sure I could count on 2 fingers the number of times  and one was a mistake)...and that is post a separate review. Generally I might tweak up and down a bit but when there is a quantum leap up or down where I don't think it's just my taste buds then a new rating arises. Yonks ago I had a quite poor version of this in fact my worst ever Talisker which given the amount I've drunk of the distilleries offerings is saying something! This is a different beast all together. Very nice creamy peaty vanilla..beautiful blend. Definitely 4.25 territory...the prior version was over wooded from memory. Redemption! Although saying that I'd rate this a 3 way joint 2nd with the Neist and Rouge and behind the 8 yr Special Release. Oh and this was the 45% version.

5.0,"Nose: Light citrus zest and juice, blended with the gentlest possible aromatic herbal tobacco. Faint brine dances about, but it's way in the background and the breeze that carries it also bears honeysuckle, strawberry jam, tangerine, ripe peach, vanilla blossom, lilac and rose petal. After resting and developing for 20 minutes the nose gains considerable heft and takes on a leathery quality, but the initial light smoked-fruit character perseveres. Later still, a more energetic tobacco note evolves and after 40 minutes of resting in the glass this whisky is still evolving and expanding. The smoke element on the nose of this dram is of a completely different quality and class than that evinced by any other smoky whisky. C'est formidable.

Palate: Masterful. Complex yet simple with waves, layers and whorls of coiling expression. The arrival and development are so closely entwined it's impossible to extricate the components. Mild peat smoke, honey, plums, berries of all description, barley sugar, marzipan, the faintest tinge of pepper and sweet chili, leathery richness, candied hazelnuts, pontefract cake, squill candy, honey jumbles, tea cake, the sweetest of red apples, smoked herring, smoked salmon, caramel ... that just scratches the surface. The signature Talisker chili ""catch"" is still there, but now it's a slow-burn glow that evolves in the late palate to fill the senses with a warmth like a sunny afternoon.

Finish: Long. Exceptionally elegant and fruity, faintly smoky, and delightfully savory, the sum total of the palate experience gently and elegantly waltzes into the gloaming.

An impeccable whisky. Seamlessly fashioned, seductive, magnificently textured - the integration and balance is a thing of beauty that brings tears to the eyes - it must be tasted to be believed. It's not cheap, but it is worth every cent. This is a desert island dram, and one of only 19 whiskies that I've awarded 5 stars on Distiller.

""As Close to Perfection as Humanly Possible"" : 5 stars"

4.75,"Ah, Talisker.  In the words of Jim Carey:  I like you.  I like you, A LOTTT!  So much so, in fact, I bought all the bottles in your core range all the way up to the 30 year old.  I’d also buy the 40 if you drop the price a scooch:  $3400 is a little too too much.  But, I digress...

The Talisker 25 year (from 2011).  I bought this bottle for $275 a few years ago in my quest to build a set of the above mentioned core range.  On a dare, I opened this to settle a dispute over what many were saying was an inferior product.  Come to find out- it was the 2017 bottling that was causing quite a stir.  My 2011 was fine, damn fine actually.

This was bottle #1613 of 5946 for 2011.  It was the first batch of 25 that wasn’t offered at cask strength.  You need to go back to 2009 and earlier for one of those puppies.  Damn.  It’s a rich gold in the taster.  Very oily with medium drops forming after a spin.  Bottled at the Talisker hot spot of 45.8% ABV.

The nose begins like all Tally’s- briny, sea salt, seashore.  I can hear the gulls squawking.  Give it some appropriate time to warm up to you slamming your nose up it’s skirt and it’ll relax and reward you with ripe raspberries, orchard fruit and baker’s chocolate.  The lightest of smoke rises and fills the neighborhood, just like a summertime backyard grill.  The smoke is light, but sure hangs heavy.  That’s heavenly IMO.

The palate returns you home to the Atlantic Isles with peppery dock wood, smoke and peat.  Mushroom earthiness, leather-bound books and malted apples with that wonderful briny backbone.  Everything is modestly dry but there’s absolutely no harshness.  It is 25 years old mind you.

The finale is long and luscious, chocolate smoke that’s rich and everlasting.  The salty bite at the very end keeps this from finishing too dessert-like and that also put a big smile on my face.  

If the earlier, cask strength bottles are considered a lot better than the blended down versions then, holy hell, where do I sign up to give my right arm for one?  I mean seriously.  This thing is right there on the line of perfection- especially if you adore Talisker.  My only gripe- it costs $275.  You can get 85% of the way here with a $78 bottle of the 18 year old.  Which begs the question:  why buy this one?  Well, I’ll tell you why- because you can’t take it with you, my friends.  Spend that paycheck and treat yourself.  You deserve it.  You really do.  4.75 stars.  Cheers."

5.0,"Its a Talisker, did you expect a lower score than 100 on a 25yo expression? Imposible.

Actually i don't believe this is the best Talisker that i have had. It is great and i would drink it any day at any hour but it feels a lot less than the 30yo and not better than the 18yo. It is amazing but not incredible. 

Bottled at talisker classic 45.8%abv, burnished gold color.

On the nose it is overwhelming. Leather.
Burnt heather. Burnt grass. Sulphur. Shoe box. Lemongrass. Pepper. Ashes.

Letting it breath releases old caramel;  burnt and thick caramel.  Is there a cherry note somewhere? I think i got cherry. After first sip is the typical toffee note from talisker. Simply outstanding.

On the palate: Orange, Pepper, Toffee, Lemon; Everything feels old. The burning peat is very fancy and delicious. 

Aftertaste has Burnt heather, Pepper, Ashes. Fire and ashes and sulphur.
So refined. Incredibly long and salty. 

Overall this is talisker on steroids, not better than the 18yo and not inferior to the 30yo. It just seems like a perfect dram between the two. A little expensive. 100 over 100. Long live King Talisker."
