3.75,"very sweet malt, good for those coming in from bourbon. heavily sherried giving notes of vanilla, nuts red dried fruits, slight spice, with a thinner than desired taste. Finish is a mouth of caramel and Sherry lingering. with 43% abv no chill filtration and natural color, great taste in the price range (~$50)"

4.0,"Nose : Strong fruity (cherry) and sweet nose. Powerful vanilla scent, a little bit of almonds.

Taste : Sweet, a distinct taste of caramel. The PX cask makes a particular and interesting taste. The oak and malt don’t give their place either.

Finish : Smooth, fruit, vanilla. Quick, doesn’t stay long.

A good scotch, with a decent price! I recommend as an everyday bottle!"

4.0,"I picked this bottle up a couple weeks back when my current favorite Whiskey store (the great Costco) had dropped the price to $46.99. I am a sucker for a good Sherried Whisky and this one seems to be high on most people's list! The fact that it's 86 proof (vs the Scotch standard 80) and is also non chill filtered is a nice bonus. I also picked up the Macallan Double Cask at the same time and will be doing a side by side tasting! So let's dive into this one! 
On the pallette its a big red fruit bomb. Ripe berries (strawberry, raspberry)and cherries. Orange peel and leather also creep in to lead the mid pallette that transitions to an oak, tobacco and malt driven long finish. Beautiful in it's construction and very well balanced. A solid 4 star dram that is only lacking a bit more depth to make a true 5 star pour. 
Cheers all!"
4.0,The neck tastes like cherry ginger cola with a delicious burn. This bottle develops to a ripe cherry brown sugar with the spice of cinnamon cardamom. A well rounded delicious whisky. Excited for the 15!

The palate follows with the flavors that you expect from the smell, but adds rich caramel and baking spices to the experience along with the first notes of oak.  The lingering finish holds you with hints of almond being added to the mix from before.  Complex and inviting, this is a great whisky for any occasion.  I can't wait to drink some more."

Sweet,rich malty nose. Surprise!!! Some fruit peeks through but the maltiness dominates. 

Palate is rich with caramel and fruit. Very pleasant and Approachable. Almost dessert like but not viscous or syrupy.

Clean smooth sweet sugary finish...sugary implied, I just wanted to use a third s-word 🙃 

Wish that Sherry came through more and had more complexity/depth.

3.25,"First time tasting anything by Glendronach and I’m not disappointed. 

Nose: heavy HEAVY dark fruits and caramel rounded off by a vanilla mustiness. I keep reading that this is supposed to be slightly smokey, but I don’t smell it at all. 

Taste: spicy, smooth Carmel gives way to dark cherries, raisins, red apples, slight red grapes. The finish lingers for a long time with barrel tannins I usually find in bourbon, heavy cream, and shell on peanuts. 

All and all, awesome whiskey. It doesn’t really take me anywhere I’ve never been before, but it’s extremely solid."
4.0,null
3.5,"Nose: Dark with a warming sweetness. Dried plums. Candied fruits (orange peels?). All covered by a woody character. Lovely. I can sniff this again and again. 

Palate: Though there are certainly elements of the same notes as on the nose, the palate is a bit dissapointing in my opinion. There is an oaky bitterness and the taste is not quite as sweet as on the nose. A but earthy (in a good way though - like really dark chocholate).

Finish: Medium-length. The oak lingers more than the fruits. A nutty taste. 

Overall: I had the bottle for some time and my opinion on this whisky varied from dram to dram. The nose was always great though. Some days I would have scored it over 4, but some days in the 3.25-3.5 range. I put 3.5 in the end as I, though it definitely had some really great moments, probably wouldn’t buy it again. Note though that I’m not a sherry-fan overall (unless peated), but I hope to find a whisky to change my mind."

4.0,Better than a macallen 12
4.25,"Nose is rich fruits from its Oloroso and Pedro Ximinez cask finish, including fig, apricot, orange rind, candied ginger, and pear cider with honey, sugar cookies, and milk cocoa. The palate has more of the same, but with cinnamon, clove, fresh herbs, and nutmeg joining. The finish is marked by a drying pepper character and more of the spice. Finish is long and eventually trends back towards the blood orange and crystallized ginger notes.

Compared to the GlenDronach 15 Revival (the 2013 and 2015 releases) this has less of the milk cocoa and nutty characters (the 15 tastes almost like a cherry cordial). This is not far off, however, and certainly makes for a great daily sipper. Not as sherry forward as say, Aberlour A'Bunadh, but having none of the tannic, solventy character of Macallan 12 and yet more sherry than a number of scotches touting their cask finishes. Balanced, overall, and a good spot on the sherry spectrum for unpeated single malts."

4.0,"This bottle comes highly recommended, and rightly so. There's a lot to enjoy here, including a creamy maltiness, well balanced wine finishes, an affordable price tag, and some outstanding packaging, which I normally don't go in for, but you gotta appreciate the details.

Here's the good stuff. Lots of caramel and vanilla on the nose (but not in the bourbon way). The wine finishes are on the nose, but not overwhelming like in Aberlour or Tamdhu. The master distillers at Glendronach have clearly spent a lot of time tinkering with the blend of the different finishes. The palate is full of sweetness from the PX and roundness from the Olorosso, which lingers on into the finish. Around the mid-palate, the malt shows up and doesn't disappoint, determined not to be overshadowed by the sherry. Right at the end there's a smoky/toffee note that is a most intriguing combination.

Now the other stuff. My biggest gripe with this malt is the finish. At 43%, it still comes off a bit thin, almost watery at the end. There's also an astringency (either from the barrel or the finish) that lingers far to long. I will say this about the wine finishes. There's a hotness on arrival from the Olorosso, as well as a mild astringency on the finish, but there's this delightful sweet, roundness in the mid-palate from the PX (Full disclosure, I'm more of a fan of PX than Olorosso).  

If you can find this bottle for a good price, by all means buy it. No regrets on this purchase, and a core malt for experiencing sherry finished Scotch. I am however left with a few questions that maybe you, dear reader, can answer. 1) How does this stack up against Glenmorangie Lasanta, which is also a Highland Single Malt with the same finishing, 2) Despite the high ""expert rating"" here, are there other Glendronach options you'd recommend over this one, and 3) I know that taste is so subjective and we all experience whisky a little different, but what would you suggest to improve this dram? Cheers!"

Oak and malt up front with slight milk chocolate, nutmeg and faint floral tones on the medium finish.  Smooth but with a mild chest warming sensation on the end.  An enjoyable and easy drinker that is not overly complex and unlikely to drive anyone away.  Essentially what I would expect of a sherry cask finish.

OK, upgrading to a four. It’s just so dang smooth!!  I’m also wondering if there’s not just a puff of smoke and sea spray in the back. This is probably just the alcohol and the imagination talking."

2.25,"So doing mac 12 old bottle vs glendronach 12 new. Sadly my blind attempt isn't going to work as I can tell these two apart from a mile away on the nose. 

Nose - the glendronach is all over the map. I get vegetable notes, light fruits, faint hints of chocolate and what not. This is very earthy and sharp. It isn't close to the dark and rich sweets and fruits of the macallan 12.

Taste - Here I get a really complex fruit bomb. It's almost skittles and alcohol. The oak is pretty mild, oak and more fruits. 

Glendronach 12 is very nice. It's not bad at all. This mac 12 BLOWS IT OUT OF THE WATER!  I will have to do a mac 12 vs mac 12 but I'm spending way too much money lately and a little book 3 which I'll be reviewing soon got in the way."

Poured neat, nose is juicy red fruit and malt with some lovely oak and a twinge of spice. Palate carries succulent fruit and plenty of malt and spice with rich flavor density. The quality is quite evident removing any misgivings of the $58 price tag. Finish is drying wood and fruity malt that lingers long for a sherry bomb. Even get some coffee with cream notes in there as well. Overall its fantastic. Creamy texture with heavy barley malt and luscious red fruits balanced against the barrel notes and sherry dryness. Battles Macallan for my top sherry finish scotch, results to follow......95/100"

Finally grabbed a bottle of this after reading all the mostly positive reviews, plus my palate tens to align pretty well with Stephanie's and her review sounded tasty.  My opening sentence was only partly in jest; this is one of those drinks that to me is elusive and difficult to pin down.  The first nose shows a lot of generic fruit and a slight mustiness.  A few sips later and I can pull leather and dust, and the fruits now smell like mincemeat instead of an edible arrangement that's sat out too long.  The taste behaves quite the same;  initial strong honeysuckle and then a blast of raisins, but subsequent trips to the well reveal that same leather as on the nose, and the raisins combine with the dust to become their slightly drier, more bitter, cousin, currants. There's Christmas spices throughout, and the rich, creamy mouthfeel is a plus.  I was surprised to find the finish is actually quite long, leaving that bit of leather and a touch of honey to linger for a solid minute.
I should be clear; this is not my preferred style of Scotch. My first sip made me think I'd bought a creamy Macallan, and anyone who's read my reviews knows I'm not a fan of that particular distillery.  On second (and third, fourth, and now fifth) visit, I'm starting to see more to this than that first impression. I'm still not 100% certain that sherry doesn't require peat, but this bottle is helping me to work through that dilemma."

4.25,"I’ve had this one on my list for months wanting to try it, so here we go. Now technically this is the second time I’ve had this whisky, but it’s my first time reviewing it and really getting a chance to explore it. I had a dram of it at a bar not too long ago, but the rocks glass it was in and the atmosphere made it a little distracting to unpack the whisky. GlenDronach is something I’ve had a strong feeling I would enjoy since I first heard about it. A heavily sherry-influenced malt aged in PX and Oloroso casks. Comes in at 43% and it’s neither chill-filtered nor has coloring added. Poured the full 50ml mini into my brand-new copita(breaking it in with this review). It’s got a lovely straw/hay color to it. Rested it around ten minutes or so before tasting, nosing it a few times while I waited.

Nose: The first thing I pick up in the nose is some citrus peel, orange if I had to choose. Definitely finding some oak in here. Another few sniffs and I’m finding some candied fruits as well as some stewed darker fruits. Some vanilla sprinkled in here, very natural like a freshly split bean-pod. There’s a beautiful sweetness to the nose, not overpowering or cloying just really nice. (Mental note: could have sworn I was smelling some dark chocolate when I had this at the bar. But not finding it now; maybe I’m crazy)

Palate: The citrus I found in the nose has disappeared and given way to more of those stewed fruits. I definitely get more oak and some spiciness on the palate as well. That lovely sweetness is still there giving the whisky an almost juicy mouthfeel.

Finish: A great long finish on this whisky. Not quite the length of Aberlour A’bunadh but it hangs around a while. It unfolds as some lasting sweetness, then spice and oak, then fades away with a little more sweetness.

Value/Overall Opinion: I am happy with my decision to buy a mini of this whisky to try it out. Locally to me a normal bottle would cost me just under $70, and I think I’d pay that. Now I could spend about $12 more and get a cask strength Aberlour A’bunadh, but this is still quite nice. A fine dram for sure and this definitely gets me excited to try some other expressions from GlenDronach."

4.5,"Let me say this first--I drink sherry cask finish Scotch less than 50% of the time, and, when I do usually prefer a nice strong accent as you would find in Aberlour 12 or Glenfarclas 10. However, when you are in the mood for a sherry-bomb, this is your ticket. It has a super-strong sherry influence. I would guess that all of it is finished or aged in sherry casks, not just a certain portion. This is not a one-trick pony, besides the heavy sherry notes there is malt, fudge, vanilla, nuttiness and a bit of spiciness. This is a great Scotch. The downside is that it usually costs as much as a good 15 year old."

4.5,"WHISKY OF THE YEAR 2019: I bought a lot of whisky this year. To the point that my wife was not pleased at all, but even as my liquor cabinet became full to bursting with fine pours such as Del Bac Dorado, Talisker 18 & DE, and Old Forester 1920, I found myself constantly returning to this one. It’s terribly well balanced in my opinion. The PX and Olorosso work very well at not overpowering the malt, and at 43%, there’s still that characteristic Glendronach spice. I got a 2017 bottling of the GD 18 that I plan to review on Christmas that's still from the Billy Walker days, largely inspired by how much I loved this pour. At $160 it was steep, but I plan on making it last.  

I’ve seen some hate for the new master blender, Rachel Barrie, particularly her limited editions, but I feel she’s doing a fine job stewarding the core range. I know the 15 isn't what it used to be, but it's still a fine pour. I’ve never finished a bottle so quickly as I did with the 12, and went out to immediately re-buy upon bottle kill. At $55 in Texas it’s a no brained. Cheers! What's your Whisky of the Year for 2019?!"

4.5,"Color is natural light gold, medium to low viscosity, non-chill filtered. Nose is delicate, not very complex, with vanilla, raisins, oak, and some barley on the back. Palate is full and balanced, with hints of honey, raisins, vanilla, oak, caramel, and some citrus notes. Finish is not short, but not too long either, with pleasant buttery vanilla, oak, and ripe fruit notes.

Subsequent nosing reveals some floral notes, and palate becomes more caramel and fruit-based. Nose becomes more complex as well, and the influence of sherry becomes very pronounced. It’s quite mature and complex for a 12-year-old, and like its 18-year-old cousin, it does change its character as time passes by.

A few drops of water in this 43% ABV dram do very little for it. In fact, I wouldn’t recommend adding it, it changed the balance for the worse.

Overall, this is a very nice 12-year-old dram that has plenty of complexity. It’s greatly enjoyable, particularly by those who like sherry cask-matured whisky. Well worth its $54 price."

4.5,"Relatively unknown by the general public, but well-respected within the whisky community. Here we've got the flagship bottling of one of what I consider to be one of Scotland's premier distilleries. While it may be second-tier in terms of popularity and distribution, this does not reflect the quality of the distillery's product.

Nose: Sherry notes. Cola, poundcake, plum, cranberry. Maraschino cherry. Unique lime citrus note. The fig, date, and raisin notes that I expect of a sherry-aged whisky are there, but they are very subdued compared to other sherry-aged malts. Toffee, honey, and vanilla. Plenty of baking spices. No alcohol. Leather and sawdust. The last one is a weird note, but I don't mind it. Solid start.

Palate: More plum, poundcake, and cola. The lime is now more like key lime pie. Red fruit. In addition to the plum, there's cherry, strawberry, raspberry, and cranberry. Still toffee, honey, and vanilla. Sweet and jammy. Slight leather note. There's a healthy dose of oak, but no spice. Rich red fruit and zesty lime are the key points here.

Finish: The plum and cola carryover, until there are replaced by the spice, which is finally present. Cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg. And some more oak. Medium length.

I hear that this stuff used to have stock aged well beyond 12 years. I've also heard that this stuff was much better when Billy Walker was running the show. Well, I can only imagine how good that must've been, because I think this iteration of GD 12 is fantastic. My personal favorite sherried 12-year.

Strong from start to finish. Respectable ABV and age statement. Great quality. I'm sold on this stuff. Good for a beginner or an experienced drinker, and it's sure to convert any beginner from Macallan. At my local store, Glendronach dropped from $60 to $54, while the standard Mac 12 jumped from $53 to $63. All within the last year.

So this may not win the popularity contest, but, for me, it emerges as the best 12 year-old sherry-aged single malt coming out of Scotland. Which is a very deep category. And that's whether you consider VFM or not. Awesome stuff, GD."

4.5,"Let me say this first--I drink sherry cask finish Scotch less than 50% of the time, and, when I do usually prefer a nice strong accent as you would find in Aberlour 12 or Glenfarclas 10. However, when you are in the mood for a sherry-bomb, this is your ticket. It has a super-strong sherry influence. I would guess that all of it is finished or aged in sherry casks, not just a certain portion. This is not a one-trick pony, besides the heavy sherry notes there is malt, fudge, vanilla, nuttiness and a bit of spiciness. This is a great Scotch. The downside is that it usually costs as much as a good 15 year old."

4.0,"Whisky is all about bringing memories to you. This wonderful dram does that. Glendronach is one of my favorites distilleries and this 12yo expression is worth every penny you pay for it. 

Bottled at a fine 43%abv, beautiful chesnut color.

On the nose is very appealing, creamy vanilla cookies, cinnamon, sherry, COOKIE DOUGH (it totally reminds me of this, when my mom prepared it to make a lemon pie),  prunes, very perfurmed, great aroma: sweet, citric and spicy.

On the palate it could be better but it is still a wonderful dram. Creamy sensation, as a grain whisky but full of flavor as a malt. Herbal pleasant dim note, prunes. Mostly cream and vanilla. The aftertaste is medium, with clove and cream. Really interesting.

I truly recommend this, you can have it easily and it is very enjoyable. 86 over 100 is a fair score for it."
5.0,"This dram is special. Very dark caramel color. Butterscotch, pulled taffy, molasses, vanilla cream, raisin with nuts. You also get a hint of orange peel and brown sugar.

4.5,"A bottle was killed in the making of this review
  Nose is very fruity up front: plum, strawberry, honeydew, It's the most wine-like whiskey I've ever smelled. It's got a sweet grain smell in the middle that reminds me of frosted flakes. Very little ethanol, I can stick my nose in there and really hang out and absorb those smells. There's a good amount of richness, like heavily buttered bread. There's some citrus around the edges, a bit of lemon, maybe some orange zest. Even a bit of blueberries on the vine.
   I've read other tasting notes, and many are very different. I'm fairly new to whiskey obsession, and it's interesting how few reviewers align on the same dram. People have different frames if reference, and preferences. When people talk about marzipan, heather, sultanas, Turkish delight, elderberries, most flowers I have no idea what they're talking about. Keep building that bank of places references ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Who cares, this whiskey is delicious.
   The flavor really resembles the nose in every respect. I don't have a wide view of sherried whiskeys, I've had Aberlour's A'bunadh, which was good, this is more approachable given the lower abv. I'm eager to try Glendronach's older offerings. At $54 this feels like a steal for an independently. Wouldn't mind keeping on the shelf."

Finish: A hint of spices and red fruit that’s ultimately eclipsed by the nutty note from the nose and palate. A wonderful medium finish.

Overall: Maybe I went in with high expectations, but I’m absolutely in love with this whisky from the first pour. The transition from sweet to nutty makes for a wonderful journey that I can’t wait to take again.

4.0,"My past Sherry Cask experiences weren't anything special. I had a few good ones, but nothing I would ever want to own a bottle off. I guess eventually I wrote it off as that maybe I just did not have a palate for sherry cask but boy was I wrong. I came across a bottle of this on sale at my local liquor store and I had to do it for the culture. I normally don't care for the color but this whiskey has a nice rich copper color and I believe they don't add color which is cool if true. The nose on this scotch is great, I get an awesome fig note ( you know those fig bars you get at the gas station) raisins, strawberry jam, honey and a bit of maltiness. On the palate you get hit with bitter chocolate followed with candied fruits, jam, raisin and figs come back and some spice round it off. Medium warm finish. This is a proper scotch if I've ever tasted one and I've had more than a few. Would love to compare this to the Macallan 12 which I've had a hand-full of times and I do not remember enjoying it as much as I am enjoying this. This is a really complex and full flavored scotch for less than 70 dollars. Can't wait to try the 15 Revival."

Finish: Moderate finish with the sherry fading quickly. Leftover are wood tannin and a little spice around the tongue.

This dram presents itself as sherry forward throughout. Notes of vanilla and raisins are woven in to create a silky rich nectar. The finish lingers long enough to remind you of the wonderful encounter your senses were presented with."

3.75,"Quite a nice dram, the amber color sets the mood right. On the nose you already get the impact of the sherry casks with a vanilla and caramel sweetness (almost like the icing on a cinnamon bun, to be oddly precise). 

It’s not overly powerful, but the medium-bodied flavor is fairly rich. Strong in toffee, caramel (caramel apples specifically), raisins, and other dried fruits. 

Very good value, definitely good quality and flavor for the price point."
4.25,"As expected, the nose is preeminently sherried, a creamy and warm apple pie with a generous sprinkling of cinnamon, raisins infused in alcohol, chocolate, cereals, strawberry jam. A pinch of ginger to break this sweet explosion. Nothing complex or layered, but very pleasant.
Accompanied still by ginger, the palate reflects the sweet soul of the whisky, finding the chocolate together with caramel, red fruits, malt biscuits, hazelnuts (and walnuts), orange marmalade, licorice. The sweetness is balanced by the bitter and metallic point of the dried fruit, in a perfect balance even in such a young whisky.
Medium finish, with hazelnuts, licorice, malt.
A simple but not trivial whisky, capable of showing a certain balance in the aromas in its youth, presenting itself as a pleasant daily drink without pretensions but not boring."

3.5,"The nose on this whisky is very nice but dry like red wine dry. Sherry soaked oak is the first thing out the glass, light red fruit, dried fruit (raisin and slight apricot) and lovely vanilla, hint of caramel, cereal malt, almond, and toffee sweetness. Taste provides malt, stewed fruits, vanilla really comes through, there is another sweetness almost like a butterscotch candy, then the sherry, the oak and oak bitterness show up ending in a light alcohol bite when left on the tongue for a long time. Finish is quite long for a highland that drinks this nicely with the vanilla and sweet, the light red fruit and dried fruit at the start of the finish and the the stewed fruit, sherry influence and little dry oak bitterness lingering from middle to end. Better than average and they're using quality sherry casks so you aren't getting that sulfur funk from some sherry casks like Glengoyne."

4.0,"GlenDronach 12

*NOSE: Fist off, props for no artificial coloring and no chill filtering. The lovely color on this is all natural. Right off the Sherry influence is obvious. You also get Vanilla, Powdered Sugar, Crisp Apple & Pear, Unpeeled Peach, Wood Spice, Black Pepper, and Ginger. The longer it sits a Floral Note creeps in. There is a great Syrupy Peach note on the empty glass. 
*NEAT: Velvety Mouthfeel. Starts off with a surprising amount of Oak. Vanilla, Ginger, Orchard Fruits, Warm Malted Cereal, Burnt Cashews, and Sherry Sweetness. There is a mid-palate jolt of Tingly Heat followed by a Longish Building Finish with a Rising Heat in the chest. Notes of Spicy Oak, Black Pepper, and Sherry coat and linger on the palate. For a while after finishing my pour, there is a flavor like an over chewed toothpick that lingers. 
*SPLASH: Better? Brighter? A few drops of water (and I mean just a few) makes the nose Stewed Apples and Cinnamon. The palate becomes sweeter with Baked Apples and Raisins like Mom use to make. Moves that mid-palate jolt of heat from the mid-palate to the finish. There is an overall mouth-numbing quality. Similar to the after effects of eating a slice of jalapeño. Very good.

*VERDICT: What an interesting whisky. Oddly, the splash made it less complex but overall more cohesive and slightly better. The nose on the empty glass is quite good, even hours later. Fairly priced at $60, I'm not sure this will ever be a staple for me, but I will definitely enjoy this bottle."

All I got was a grassy meadow on the nose. Kind of like a mild lowland malt. The palate was smooth and pleasant but didn’t stand out in anyway. The finish was the same. I didn’t get any of that stuff the pro reviewer was talking about. That guy’s full of shit. It wasn’t bad, but I was expecting a lot more. Felt like I was drinking a middle of the road Auchentoshan.
