1.0,"I am a huge laws fan. In fact, just bought a case of the four-grain bourbon today. That being said, this bottle was no good. The sweetness of the wine overpowered everything. It smelled like wine, and it tasted wine.  Maybe a different wine cask would’ve imparted a complementary flavor, but not this one"
