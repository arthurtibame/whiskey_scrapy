4.5,The spiral of wood actually works. I would have never guessed it's a 2 year whiskey. Oak and vanilla on the nose and palate. Very smooth finish. Well done!
2.5,"Oaky, kinda boring. Not much for other flavors."

3.25,"Two years old and just plain boring. Corn on the nose and corn on the pallet. No complexity whatsoever. More of a gimmick than anything. Easy to sip on if you really enjoy a sweet corn forward nose and palate. At this age a higher proof would do nothing for it other than make it taste boozy and harsh. It could be an decent whiskey, it just needs about four more years in the barrel."

3.75,"On the nose I pick up cinnamon, vanilla, and oak. It has some mellow spice. You can taste caramel and butterscotch at first and the finish is long with flavors of cinnamon and a bit of pepper. Not as rich and sweet as I was expecting."

2.75,"Nose: toasty/dusty grain with big spice aroma.  lots of cinnamon sugar here, with other spice hints (pumpkin spice-type melange).  Even though it's American Oak reminds me of aromatics of toasted French Oak.  
Palate: thin of body but huge in terms of spice.  Peanut brittle segues into sweet cornbread and wildflower honey before the long spice blast takes over, with tons of cinnamon, clove, and pumpkin spice latte. Does it make the overall product taste older than it likely would otherwise? The answer there is absolutely. However, it feels a bit like the overall profile was thrown a bit out of whack here, to the point of it seeming slightly artificial—an infusion of spices on top of a grainy, slightly green, younger bourbon, as if a tea bag of spice was used to give it a bit of extra oomph. Not bad, all in all, but it feels slightly on the guileless side."

3.75,Smells of toffee and starts mild and builds with toasted oak before trailing off. Not a long finish but a pleasant sipper.
