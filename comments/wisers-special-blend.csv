1.0,"Too harsh without much payoff in flavour. After half a 375 ml bottle I threw in the towel and relegated the rest of it to the pantry for use when cooking. Might be more worthwhile as a mixer, but I never tried it with anything but an ice cube."

5.0,I like it with Coca-Cola and Ice!!
2.5,"The patriotism in me will hand this whiskey an average grade. I mean, it's not liquid Anthrax or anything, plus everything gets an average grade with 7up.  😏

I'd describe it, but it's so fleeting that no notes other than dill come to prominence. 

Slainte!"
2.75,Smells like a wisers looks like a wisers but doesn’t really taste like a wisers. tastes really young and A little hot. Like the spice hit but crazy to think how amazing the other wisers products are for only a little bit more cash
