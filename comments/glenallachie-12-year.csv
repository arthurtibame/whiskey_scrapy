4.0,Ralfie dot com brought me here. Yea. He’s right. This well-priced dram packs a punch in all the right spots.
4.25,"After reading some great reviews I was excited when this bottle became available here in Quebec. All the boxes checked, it's a great one indeed! Fruity and nutty aroma's on the nose, a little sour note as well. Also some spice on the background most likely from the virgin oak casks. On the palate just great balanced sherry flavours, dried figs, grapes, apricots, a faint little salt and some bitter chocolat. Very well done. The finish lingers on for medium length. On par with Glendronach 12! Cheers all"
3.75,palate has a bit of funkiness similar to wine terroir. the sweetness lays right over top making it an easy drinking pour.

4.25,"Everybody loves a comeback story.  I know, I know- Glenallachie never really left.  But, once master distiller Billy Walker bought the obscure, Highland distillery it sure feels like a comeback.  When he sold his stake in BenRiach and GlenDronach to become the sole owner of Glenallachie a lot of people took notice.  Including me.  If you love GlenDronach and BenRiach, well you just know you’re going to love his new project.  I mean, the guy is a legend.

So, here we are in late 2017 and Mr Walker takes over and begins scouring the vast supply of single malt in Glenallachie’s warehouses.  Rumor has it that he selected all of the casks to be used for the relaunch of the brand.  He blended multiple casks of 10, 12, 18 and 25 year old stock to make these core offerings.  The inaugural bottles of all 4 age statements were bottled on two consecutive days in the summer of 2018 and released with new labeling and packaging.  These are all considered what he thought were the best casks at each age.  He bottled the 10 year as cask strength and the others at 46%, including this 12 year old.  Even though there is no official labeling stating these as Batch 1, it’s commonly accepted that these were when they hit the market in the fall of 2018.

I found a 3cl pour of this online because I wanted to try a pour without having to open any bottles from the inaugural release (yes, I bought them all and stashed them away- just in case).  This 12yo is rich gold in color and is pretty oily while leaving behind medium drops and no legs on the sides of the Glencairn.

The nose is very reminiscent of GlenDronach:  very spicy and warm.  There’s red berries and damp oak propping it up from the start because it took me awhile to coax the sherry cask notes out of it.  I ended up letting this one sit over half an hour and must’ve spun and nosed it a dozen times.  I don’t know why it’s so shy.

The palate bursts forward with tropical fruits, banana bread and oak tannins.  The sherry cask provides a great backbone and creates a mouthwatering initial sip.  There’s wonderful heat from the elevated ABV and the fruitiness just clings to every corner of your mouth.  Excellent mouth feel here, almost unrelenting, and I love it.

The finish is somewhat short and drying, but I did notice the sugary fruit lingering on for some time.  I think it really applies more to the mouth coat from the palate and less of an aftertaste.  

Overall, this thing was surprisingly good.  I’d have to say the rumors must be true as the casks chosen here really do make a great first impression.  I only hope Glenallachie can continue to deliver the goods and Billy can keep this blend consistent.  The bottle cost me $48 and I feel like that’s a steal for what you’re getting with the initial release.  I’m curious how the cask strength 10’s are and I am actively looking for a pour to find out.  That said, this one is easily a 4 star dram, with a boost for price point and creating excitement from such an obscure distillery.  If Mr Walker can do for Glenallachie what he did at GlenDronach and BenRiach, well we are in for some delicious juice.  Seek this one out, my friends.  Cheers."

4.5,"Для меня это лучший виски, из моего весьма скромного опыта. В бокале ощущается запах апельсина, выпечки,вереска и специй. Мягчайший сладкий вкус с бананоново-медовым (сам удивлен), шоколадным, маслянистым развитием и ванильной выпечкой в завершении. Бочки шери отдают своё.  Пью стоя и аплодирую! 4,4 и весьма рекомендую!"
4.25,"Oak, vanilla, butter cookie, cinnamon in the nose. Tannins, saltiness, spice, wood, citrus flavors. This one is lovely."
3.25,"Nose: orange cream cooler
Sharp and sweet, tropical fruit, vanilla, very floral, acidic

Long finish, spicy and woody"
4.75,"One fantastic whisky with vanilla and raisins character. Hint of banana and pineapple, strong malty finish which last quite long. Decent stuff."

4.0,"When Billy Walker said in an interview that 'running GlenAllachie is fun', he caught my interest. Can you have a better motivation? With its selection of PX, Oloroso and virgin casks, the 12-year-old expression offers a busy nose. Fruity acidity, butterscotch and shortbread are followed by cinnamon, clay and fresh mint. Full-bodied, peppery and slightly mineral, the taste features banana, sage and hints of mocha. After Eights, citrus zest and jelly babies accompany the cask-dominated finish. There are no shortcuts to quality, and this malt is ticking all the boxes.

RATING: 3.9/5.0 stars ≙ 86 pts → FIRST-CLASS [-]"

3.75,"Honing kaneel en boter(achtige) geuren. Fris, citrus en honing daarna, gevolgd door klein bittertje, nasmaak een (ontzettend milde) zoethout achtige afdronk. Droge nasmaak.

2de neus: frisser, 
Smaak: vooral in de afdronk en nasmaak zit de complexiteit. Voor een Speyside bitterder, niet zo zoet als de doos doet denken. Mocca/koffie smaak"

3.5,"Nose: Strong influence of oak. Not particularly complex and clean, green spirit with floral and grassy notes. Light influence of Sherry.

Mouth: delicate and fresh. Soft and well balanced. A bit plain, perhaps.

Finish: very short and rather forgettable."

4.0,Sweet and smooth.  Very nice scotch.
4.0,"Nose - Creamy caramels, apples, grilled pineapple, honey.

Taste - Honey, light spicy heat, creamy caramel, fried plantains, light fruity bitter/starch, apple cores, hint of golden raisins

Finish - Quickly fading heat, lightly dry/starchy feeling, honey, golden raisins, starchy plantains, light fruity bitter

Score - 83/100

Final Thoughts - This was a pleasant dram overall. Nice nose, mouthfeel and generally pleasant overall experience. No real off putting notes unless you don't like banana-like flavors. The slight fruity bitterness can get a bit distracting, but it's not in your face. This feels like a nice summery sipping dram where it's not really that complex and you can just pour & sip neat or on ice all day long.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - If it was around $30-$40?"

2.75,Очень приятный фруктовый аромат. Но вкус разочаровал. Ожидаешь большего.
3.75,"In the glass flows a pleasant caramel, all natural.
The aroma on the nose is clearly sherried, a lot of raisins infused in alcohol with cinnamon, ripe apple, caramel, candied orange. Undercoat of malt and some herbaceous splashes, with a very slight acidity.
At the entrance, there comes a slightly unsettling bitter note that remains throughout the drink. Not very full-bodied, with unripe banana, cooked apple, raisins, cinnamon and a pinch of anise. A touch of woodiness and lemon on the length. A more bitter sweetness than smell.
The finish is medium-long, which still leaves a bitter background with cinnamon and cooked apple."
3.5,As I am experiencing more varied types and qualities of whisky in my Scotch journey I feel I have to take my rating down again. I can tell you from all the great scotch flavors I have discovered from first tasting this one I will not be buying again. Even if I had to pay a little more there are much more flavorful whiskies out there.
3.75,Bringing down a notch as I'm tasting some  really good drams!

4.0,"As was the reason for many, these guys caught my eye because of the introduction of Billy Walker as master distiller. I'm a huge fan of Glendronach, and though I hadn't gotten into the distillery until after his departure, the internet seems to agree that it was even better than it is today under the guidance of Billy Walker. Naturally, I'm curious to see what he can do in a new environment.

Nose: Apple, pear, apricot, vanilla, honey, toffee. Creamy. Some banana, coconut, and orange. Very malty, traditional Speyside notes, a bit tropical. A bit of sulfur, which doesn't play too well with the rest of the nose, though it's barely detectable. Green, grassy, and floral. Mild oak. Not a bad start.

Palate: A lot of the same fruit notes. Apple, pear, apricot, banana, and orange. Now with lemon. Less 'tropical' than the nose, but much more citrus. Oak spice is ramped up, now accompanied by a dose of cinnamon. Spice replaces the sulfuric note from the nose. Heavy on the butterscotch, along with vanilla, honey, and toffee. Milk chocolate as well, which is a classic sherry/bourbon Speyside note. This time it's virgin oak, but the product is the same. I find that interesting. At any rate, solid taste--it's a more cohesive iteration of the nose. 

Finish: A few things here. More milk chocolate and orange citrus. Some more of the apple/pear. Spice: cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and oak. Butterscotch and toffee. Floral notes. Moderate length. Impressive finish for a baseline offering. 46% ABV definitely helps this.

I think this a good first effort in for Billy Walker as he attempts a distillery that has traditionally produced blend-fodder into a single malt powerhouse. I can only expect this particular offering to improve--as the age statement on this whisky far exceeds his time as master distiller at Glenallachie.

This is a great embodiment of an entry level-Speysider. It's got the classic profile, but interesting enough to distinguish itself from the pack. Olorosso, PX, and Virgin Oak (Don't know if I've had this combination before). 46%. Much more interesting than the standard bourbon cask 40% and bourbon/sherry 43% that have become formulaic. This is unique, and it's good. Looking forward to see the fruits of Billy Walker's latest project. Good start here. 4/5."
