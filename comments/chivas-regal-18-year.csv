4.0,"Opened this alongside it's younger sibling 12 year old to do a little comparison.  It's blended using several 18 year old malts, but comes in at the normal 80 proof.  It's a darker copper in color and smells heavily of sweet, sherry-casked whisky.

On the palate it's nicely sweet with a very nice oak and vanilla profile.  There's almost no heat, which is excellent for a blended scotch IMO.  The finish is medium length and extremely smooth.  If this bottle came in at a more reasonable price for a blend I'd keep it stocked at the bar.  Very non-offending to Highland style scotch drinkers.  At close to $80 a bottle I can think of many single malts I'd rather spend that money on, but on its own merits it's actually pretty damn tasty.  Closer to 3.75 stars than 3.5.  Cheers."

3.0,"I think the current 3.5 user average is just about perfect.  This is kind of the scotch I'd build in the lab if I wanted to give someone a good overview of the spectrum of scotch flavors, but turned to about a 4-5 in intensity.  I get honey, malt, and a bit of musty newspaper and pencil shavings on the nose, but the 18 years that all the components aged have clearly mellowed this dram out -- it's very understated.  I taste honey again, a healthy bite of apple, and some almond on the palate, which is smooth, sweet, and malty again.  The finish is probably the best phase, with a tiny bit of smoke or coffee that reveals there's been some peat here all along.  It's a little thin, but sweet, of decent length, and enjoyable, like a muted version of Highland Park.  For the price, you could do better, you could do worse -- I'd probably vote for a Talisker or Highland Park myself, either of which features a more distinctive and punchy, but similar, profile."

2.5,"Nose: Caramel, brown sugar, raisins, some orange, a little vanilla.

Palate: Caramel and malt, dark fruits. Even more caramel and toffee comes out as it opens. Some chocolate and a hint of oak and gentle spice.

Finish: Medium/short. Sweet and simple.

This is a very average blend with a rather dull character built around simple caramel aromas and flavours. Frankly, it’s disappointing - when you pay more than the price of a bottle Compass Box Spice Tree you should get more than just average quality.

There’s nothing actively bad, it’s just all very bland and heavy and there is no finish at all.  It works well as a mixer because the flavours are thick and don't get drowned by soda or soft drink, but frankly I'd expect to be able to say more about a blend that is this expensive.

4.0,"Appearance: Looking in on this 18 year old blended scotch the color is russet copper. Swirling it around in my Glencairn, the legs are very thin and viscous.

Nose: The sweet nose contains notes of floral honeysuckle, apricots, mango juice, as well as mild peat, salted peanut shells, light clove cigar smoke, and cinnamon.

Taste: The palate is reminiscent of a Christmas dessert - red apple, cinnamon, cloves, pear, cashews, as well as the addition of mild peaty brine, although the taste is delicious, it's more subtle and not as explosive as I was expecting.

Finish: The finish is medium long in length,  and one is left with a honey and cashew/ macadamia nut aftertaste. 

Thoughts: Chivas does a fantastic job on their blends, in my opinion. And this one in particular is so so good! This dram is a very well rounded scotch experience. The only complaint (if you can call it that) that I would have is that with something this old I personally expected the palate to stand out more than it did. But it was still delicious, and I loved the experience! Chivas, great job and thank you! Sláinte!"

Chill filtered
Color added

Nose: sweet and sour of red and green apple; cream soda; oak cask; caramel; vanilla; hints of cinnamon, nutmeg and toffee; slight alcohol note.

Taste: surprisingly complex! Initially watermelon, apple, pear and a hint of pineapple develops into a medium bodied and rounded caramel, barley/grain and toffee, all backed by a very slight astringency of citrus or alcohol.

Finish. Short and mouth watering, with vanilla, chocolate, cola, and a hint of pepper.

Value: $60-75 USD. Solid price for an 18 year blended scotch.

Final thoughts: I don’t mind this pour one bit. For a blend aged 18 years you can do far worse, and in fact this, may be the best blended 18 from a big multinational “for the masses” distillery you can get. It’s relaxed, has some complexities (which are heightened by a few drops of water) and comes at a decent price. Nothing here will blow your mind, but I can see myself having this on hand for those days where I just need a decent scotch and don’t want to think more about it, or as a pour for mildly discerning guests. As an aside, this could actually be a stellar blend at 46% or, hell, even maybe 43%, but dream on, right? ;)

Score: 3/5

Recommend trying out buying a bottle at a good price."

3.75,"A smooth yet flavorful dram worth admission to a whisky cabinet. Fruit and subtle smoke, not peat, on the nose and tongue. Oak notes evaporate into a slight pepper on the finish. Read my friend Baldbruce’s review for a nice overview of our experience at Strathisla and a cask strength tasting of this and other Chivas expressions. I highly recommend this tasting if you go to the distillery."
3.75,"Expert tasting notes are spot on and good value for price.  For some reason avoided Chivas products for a few decades but toured the Strathisla distillery in Speyside.  Very impressive and highly recommend the barrel strength tasting.  All were great and brought the 18 at  40% when the barrel was much higher, maybe 55%.  Are were great but not available for retail.  So brought the 40% 18yr old based on barrel tasting, which is not fair...  you need to tour Speyside!"

Final Thoughts - So not the most complex dram but this one is super easy to drink. Very pleasant flavors that are nicely balanced although a bit on the thin side. I could see a bottle of this being very quickly finished in a night with some friends and something as simple as a plate of fruit and lighter flavored cheeses.

Finalização: curta e suave. Sua baixa oleosidade não permite muita persistência, porém um pouco de apimentado e dulçor ficam presentes.

Impressões gerais: bom blend, pode-se degustar puro mas recomendo uma esfera de gelo no copo para amenizar o impacto do álcool. Para quem busca algo mais complexo, é possível encontrar bons single malts por um preço muito similar ao deste blend, no entanto o Chivas 18 anos é uma boa companhia para momentos descontraídos que exigem um bom whisky ao lado."

18 year old grain whisky is what this tasted like next to the lovely Johnnie Walker 18 year I just reviewed.  I don’t know how many drops of Strathisla they decided to add to this, but this is at is core an industrial grain whisky.  It’s 18 years old, so it’s starting to not taste like shit, like the 12 year old Chivas absolutely tastes like.  But when you have an age statement of 18 years and a pricetag of $56, you get what you pay for.

The first nose is where this whisky tries to sell you.  It is so sweet.  Toffee, caramel, and magnolias.  But, in the mouth, this is a letdown.  Just sugary and underdeveloped.  Cheap grain whisky dominates, and you get just hints of sherry and bourbon wood maturation.  The finish is syrupy and slightly metallic.  This is drinkable, and serves its purpose best when trying to make an unpleasant task more pleasant; but almost any whisky in this price range can also serve that purpose.

Still, there is decent complexity and the sweet finish is nice even though the whole thing is a bit light.
