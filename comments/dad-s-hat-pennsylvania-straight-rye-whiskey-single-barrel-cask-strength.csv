3.5,"FWGS single barrel pick, bottled 4-24-17, a solid offering!"
4.5,"Just cracked open a Store Pick Cask Strength, Single Barrel Dad's Hat Rye at 4 years and 122.4 proof... and WOW, I'm blown away by the quality (especially at the price but honestly at any price).  These guys are really killing it out here (both the distillers and the barrel pickers).

My notes: Apple, red wine, cherry jam, port wine, and rhubarb pie filling in the nose with a slight hint of violet or some other flower.  Flavor is stewed fruits, mulled wine, and maraschino cherries with a hint of violet and a ginger-and-cracked-white-pepper-like burn on the finish that lasts and lasts and lasts. Maybe a hint of cocoa floating around there, too. Really coats the month. Surprisingly low alcohol burn at 122.4 proof, but the rye spice heat is unmistakable.

Man, this is good!
