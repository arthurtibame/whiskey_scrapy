4.0,"Neat; Strong spearmint nose with notes of oak, saw dust & sweetness. Sweet oak flavor with notes of dark fruit. Oak finish with a touch of spearmint & nuts. Nutty lingering flavor with notes of alcohol. 
The synhitic cork used for my bottle is ""peeling."" Not sure if anyone else is experincing this problem.
Solid bourbon, but not worth the $99.99 price tag."

null,"Overpriced, very similar to original cheap one, similar to Rebel Yell 10:

4.0,"Nose- sweet, honey, pears. Taste- oak, slight tobacco, leather. Coffee aftertaste. This really opened up for me after a few weeks. Fantastic bourbon in a really nice bottle."
4.0,"Oily and semi sweet. Notes of coffee, oak. Not super complex but really great whiskey."

4.0,"Dark amber in color, very nutty and quite similar to the Rebel Yell 10 in flavor but slightly better. Cool bottle for sure but there are better whiskies in this price range and cheaper. 

88/100"

2.0,This is so nutty it tastes like a proofed down Booker's.
4.0,"Really a great bourbon! Maybe a little overpriced at $120, but I am glad I bought it. It has a Smokey oak flavor, smooth with some heat. The decanter is also cool looking."

4.0,"Smells great. Rich brown sugar, oak, char. Sweet and oaky, with a slight spice kick towards the end that lingers. Feels restrained at first, but it's still good and seems to open up after a bit. Some milk chocolate at the end, with some cacao nibs. 7/21/18"
4.0,"7/10.  Vanilla bomb.  Very soft on the nose and the palate.  Cherry wood taste up front, followed by tons of vanilla with a medium finish of oak and baking spices.  Went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised.  Creamy mouthfeel, slight hints of black pepper."
5.0,Warm Biscuit with subtle hints of caramel

4.0,Spicy.  Good flavor
4.0,"Drinking this at Founders Tavern & Grill, 29 dollar pour. I’d buy it if you can find it for under 100.00 a 750ml. 
Very good BIB smooth no major burn, lightly spiced. Creamy when you let it hang in your month for a couple of seconds before you drink this easy neat sipper. No need to ice or water."

4.0,"Not as oily as Elijah barrel prof. Light spicy notes,"
4.5,"This one tells me it’s going to be oily, sweet and decadent just from the nose. Over-ripe cherry with strong vanilla undertones. So good. Rich, sweet and creamy with just enough heat to make it captivating. I don’t recommend the addition of water as it doesn’t add enough to merit diluting the sumptuousness of the base bourbon. 4.4."

5.0,Spicy but smooth.  Good flavor and does feel like high proof whiskey.
5.0,"Great balance, great finish. Loved this!"
4.0,Smooth start with hot late finish. Spicy undertones.
4.0,"8/10

Light ethanol on the nose, first taste immediate is like something else. Sugar, pear, vanilla. Extremely smooth finish, hint of green apple."
3.0,"Nose: After letting the alchohol dissipate,  chestnuts, vanilla
Pallete: Heavy barrel.  Long finish uncut. Opens up after 2 drops. Cotton candy? Carmelized sugars."

3.5,Sweet with slight spice on the finish.  Smooth but theres a taste on the palate i dont care for.  Nothing special. Only had a pour for $15 for 1 ounce but not sure i will buy this rare bottle at msrp
3.0,The nose was overpowering of alcohol. Had this side by side with Weller 12 year and that just was in another league compared to the Old Fitzgerald 11. This wasn't my favorite.
4.5,"The color is a brownish, dark amber with heavy legs that coat the glass. The nose is full of corn, caramel and charred oak at first, with molasses, vanilla and a hint of honey and dark chocolate following it up. The palate is a wonderful burst of pepper balanced by caramel, honey and vanilla while oak and caramel holds it all together. The finish is long with spice mixing with caramel and oak that takes its time to fade, as dark chocolate and vanilla linger behind it."
4.5,High spice with kettle corn and a beautiful Peanut butter brittle followed by a thin brine. Delicious with a few drops of water.

3.5,"N: Corn, Cinnamon, pepper, salted caramel and honey, hints of apples in glencarin, nutty

P: honey up front, toasted oak and almonds, hints of nuts and vanilla extract middle with an almost sour note

F: chocolate, oak, and pepper

overall a good classic pour worth the high retail price, when you include presentation"

4.0,"Candied Pecan aroma with a density that lingers.

First sip was soft and muted compared to what the aroma offered.
Additional sips brought out the yeastiness, nuttiness and corn.

The finish brings out the Moderate wood, and a lingering orange."
3.75,"Very good, but for the price I think I would chose others with a lower price if blind tasting...being honest.
Wife and I did finish the bottle and they let us keep it with an 1/8th of an ounce left.
Will make it an Old Fitzy Infinite bottle. Ha!"

4.0,"Nose: smooth oily sugary oak. The wheated mashbill and resemblance to Old Rip 10 comes through for me. 

Palate: very smooth and rich. Not much spice. A muted Old Rip 10 year or less spicy and sweeter than Old Weller Antique. 

Finish: no bite. Quite smooth."
5.0,"I had just a taste, but it’s one of the best I’ve had. Sweet, super smooth, and full-bodied. I wish I had a bottle."
5.0,wish this was easier to find. Sweet up front making it easy to tip back. just enough suttle spice at the end to keep you interested.
4.75,Very smooth. Bit of spice but easy backend finish

4.25,"NYE @ Blossom Bar in Brookline, MA ($16/oz).

Well-rounded, but standard, bourbon profile. Baking spices, Brown sugar. Medium-Medium+ mouthfeel. Not too hot. Medium+ finish. Worth a try but probably not a buy even at MSRP, let alone secondary."
