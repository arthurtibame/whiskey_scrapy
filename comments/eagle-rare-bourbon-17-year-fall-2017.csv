3.0,"Smells like sweet orchard fruit, cider like. Some nuts and damp wood as well. Feels thin. Very smooth. Nice baking spices, cookie dough, sweet fruit, some oak. A bit of pecan shell at the end. Pleasant. 11/26/17"

4.0,"Great nose, rich and deep. Brown sugar, leather, clove honey. On the palate, sharp and acidic, very woody, with a hint of fruit. The flavor coats the mouth, and the warmth slowly covers the throat. Pleasant spice. This is definitely a nice bourbon, but it's hard to justify the hype. Enjoy it when you find it for a decent price. 8/2/18"

5.0,It's eagle rare but with a little less sweetness and more intensity on the finish. Overall it's excellent but hard to beat the proofers in the BTAC lineup. Some spice and oak although less than I'd expect from 17 years. I'd love a bottle of this. It's a solid 90-94 rating

4.0,"Toasted caramelized  sawdust on the nose. Like smelling a leather strap. Palate confirms and brings added spice, specifically cinnamon. Intensely dry. Subtle fruit and richness. Surprisingly prefer the regular 10 to this."

3.0,"Nose- Sweet candy corn, powdered sugar, orange, cloves, brown sugar

Palate- Rich vanilla, caramel, cherries, cinnamon, barrel char

Finish- Medium, thin finish with notes of sweet cherries, baking spice and vanilla

For a $900-$1000 bourbon, I can’t help but be disappointed with this. It’s good, don’t get me wrong, but there are some bourbons sitting on the shelf right now for 50 dollars that are just as good, if not better than this. There’s alot of sweetness to it and less oak than I would’ve expected. My biggest complaint is that it’s not very unique at all, just a lot of traditional bourbon notes. Completely fails in comparison to the high proof BTAC lineup."

5.0,"Holy crap!  This is a must if you can get your hands on it.  My excitement to try it overwhelmed what I should have been doing which was paying attention to the notes.  But that’s how smooth and subtle this one is!  And before you know it, it’s all over.  A very rare taste!"

5.0,Sooooo smooth!  It’s amazing how the longer time in the barrel changes this so much!  Need a bottle!  6/23/18 at Front Street Brewery flight.
