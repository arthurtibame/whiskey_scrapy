5.0,"Neat. Sample provided by Scott at My Bourbon Journey (fantastic YouTube channel if you have never checked out his content).  This is from 1983.  This is the oldest bourbon (in terms of bottled date) I have ever tried and this is my first Heaven Hill pre-fire taste.  So I am quite excited and appreciative to sit down with it today.

For 86 proof it is very rich and oily.  Reminds me of Wild Turkey 17 in the sense that it’s low proof should not be underestimated.  On the nose is sweet corn, caramel, and a fantastic cherry note.  Some nice vanilla and pie crust, begins to come off as a fruit tart even.  Getting some chocolate and cinnamon as I sit with it more.  Hint of honey even.  A nutty aspect is emerging too.  It is a pretty perfect nose honestly.  Sweet, delicious, and evolving.

Nice creamy texture that really lights up the palate.  Blast of fruits as it sits in the tongue, cherry, apple, raspberries.  So sweet.  Transitions to a rich caramel and oak.  Legs bring back a very nice cherry finish.  Once again, though lower proof, it is very oily which is giving it a nice medium to long finish.  

I was born the year this was released.  Sampling this makes 1983 even more special to me.  This is such a perfect bourbon.  I have an ounce left of the sample that I will be cherishing and cracking open on a special occasion."
