3.5,"Great for the Fall/Winter. Sweet flavor but keep in mind that it’s 82 proof so it is not syrupy like the William Wolf or Ballotin products (which are delicious but a bit too sweet for me). Even if the spices were not in this, the whiskey would be considered a solid everyday drinker."
4.0,Good stuff. Good in fall

2.0,Liquid Christmas. The spices invoke memories of the holidays and family. It is good but I find I can enjoy it only in small doses. I suspect it will make some interesting cocktails but I only tried it neat.
2.75,"Like the flavors, but the slight sweetness and thickness reminded me of cheap liquor."
