4.0,"Oh this is really good.  It's not kick in the face Ardbeg 10 good, or the complexity of Uigi good---but right up there in a very different way.  Wet tar and brine on the nose.  Ropes sitting by the ocean.  The aroma really takes me back to our cabin we rented on vacation in northern Norway on Lofoten Islands.  I can smell this all day.  Taste is oily and briny.  Anchovies?  I'm so glad this is part of the regular line up.  And affordable too!  Thanks to [email protected]   After having this, I bought a bottle immediately."

2.0,An Oa was bitter to me. The other special offerings are just not as smooth as the 10.
3.0,"This is a well executed blend that should be more approachable for casual drinkers than a typical Ardbeg, yet is still true enough to its distillery’s character to make an appealing alternative for the fan base. The dominant flavors throughout are lemon and dark chocolate, a combination that’s hard to fault. There’s also a whiff of wet wood on the nose, which is less overpoweringly peaty than many an Ardbeg. You’ll find a sweet crescendo mid-palette as the sherry influence rises, followed by the peppery peat reasserting itself on the finish. A dash of water surprisingly extends the aftertaste. It’s not as complex or as pleasantly challenging as Uigeadail, but it’s enjoyable enough to keep in the home bar rotation. A welcome addition to the family."
4.0,"Great briny seaside smell as soon as you pop that top! If this is supposed to compete with the Laphroaig Triplewood, then they are doing well on the nose already. Honey with mint..pepper, and maybe some oranges. 46.6, so it's off to neat land! Medium mouth coat on oil. There was smoke on the nose, but not on the palate. I like it a lot better than the standard 10 because I am not getting lemon on the taste either. What I do get is refreshing peat, barley, malt, faint chocolate, and nuts... like a cashew with some spice..maybe nutmeg on the back end. The finish is medium length, but a little dry, with a ton of smoke - ashtray style. The only ""complaint"", and I use this word very lightly, would be that the deep smoke isn't here like an Oogie or Corry, but wow, for a nice summer/autumn dram, I can see getting this from time to time when I want something lighter. Even though it sounds complicated, it's not. $70 before tax!"

4.0,"A dram of this and a free glass were our consolation prizes after being told by Ardbeg's Visitor Center Manager, Jackie Thomson, that she didn't want to fill the next distillery tour because the group required an interpreter and she thought it might be too busy for them. I assume it was the group of Frenchies we saw double-cheek kissing her while we were having lunch in their renovated and upscale cafe. For those of you that don't know the history, Glenmorangie bought Ardbeg from Hiram Walker in 1997 when production was limited. Glenmorangie was then acquired by LVMH (Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton), the luxury goods conglomerate, in 2004. LVMH has net income of about $6 billion on annual sales of around $35 billion. Much of these inflated profits come from people willing to spend up to $10,000 for a Louis Vuitton handbag made with about $20 bucks of cheap leather. Not wanting to get ripped off, I only spend about $1,500 for my wife's Gucci's made with the same cheap leather. Anyway, since Ms. Thomson was very polite and also easy on the eyes, she somehow mesmerized us into not getting worked up. The important thing to be gleaned from all of this is the direction both Glenmorangie and Ardbeg are heading with NAS expressions. Since the acquisition of Glenmorange by LVMH, their bottles have been redesigned to have a more curvaceous and appealing look. They are also coupled with elegant sounding names such as The Quinta Ruban, Nectar d'Or, and LaSanta. Soon, we will need to order our whisky with the assistance of a sommelier. Ardbeg is going in a similar direction with a lineup of cool sounding NAS whiskies designed to get to market quickly. Double maturation, quarter-casking, and use of virgin American and European oak are all experiments that have produced some excellent single-malts in an accelerated timeframe, so I wouldn't expect this trend to end anytime soon. After all, increased sales and profits are the name of the game. As for Ardbeg AN OA, well...........I've never had an Ardbeg that I would rate less than 4 stars, and the same holds true here. My favorite, however, is still Ardbeg 10, so I hope they don't mess with the recipe."

5.0,"Here's an interesting experiment, the first new permanent Ardbeg expression in years and years.  The result is . . . something that smells and tastes a lot like Ardbeg 10:  smoke, peat, hay, citrus, seasalt, gravel, and some faint sherry.  It finishes with a really nice coda of peat and malt.  The resemblance was so strong that I poured a glass of Ardbeg 10 to compare them head-to-head.  An Oa has an oilier nose and is moderately richer on the palate and finish.  I’m a little unnerved — the fact that this product is so similar to 10 suggests that Ardbeg may get out of the age statement game altogether and just have An Oa, Uigeadail, and Corryvreckan as their unpronounceable, triple-threat permanent range.  Perhaps that's not the worst thing in the world.  An Oa is a respectable substitute for 10, albeit a more expensive one, but I'll give it the same rating that I gave the 10.  I hope that, if the distillery gets rid of 10, they drop the price of this expression just a little bit to make up for it.  But, since Ardbeg presumably is run by capitalists, that is not going to happen.  Thanks to Telex for the sample!"
3.0,"Interesting, interesting. I bought a bottle of this and the Kelpie today (which I tasted and loved on Ardbeg day). Lemony pepper, Ardbeg 10ish is the profile I got out of it. If I was being cynical (and honest) I'd say it's an Ardbeg Ten with a bit of a twist at a higher price point which allows them to discontinue the 10 yr eventually, free up more casks for their NAS range and justify the overall rolling price increase of their core range. So do I like it? It's not bad. Would I buy another bottle? No. Back to back we paired it against the Redbreast Lasatau (and several other 50ml whisky samples) and we kept going back to the RBL. I'll give it a 3.25 rounding down to a 3. Initially I had rated higher but having drunk it a few times more it's to similar to the thin lemony pepper profile of the 10 yr which I'm not a huge fan of vs the viscous tarrish sherrish profile of the Ugie or the rich oily peaty sweetness of the Kelpie. So in summary 2nd to last (b4 the 10) in my Ardbeg favourite list."
4.0,"Scotland, September 2017 (from notes).

Nose: Classic Ardbeg sweet smoke with some sharp gingery and pepper spices that never quite dethrone the sweet, briny seaweed smells. There's some pine resin and even star anise in there as well.

Palate: Sweet and peaty to start with, developing into a most unusual combination of creamy, oily and dry spices plus a whiff of smoked ham and smoked herring. Underneath there's some aniseed and something like chewing tobacco, but mild, and some orange marmalade.

Finish: Long, sweet and rich but touches of dark chocolate keep any sense of being cloying at bay. A little citrus at the very end.

A young but well-behaved NAS that provides a nice experience overall and is a good addition to the core range. There is an unmistakable similarity to the 10 year old but more diversity of aroma and flavor, however there is also arguably less focus and depth. It’s wider but not as deep, if you take my meaning.

46.6% is the perfect strength for this - I enjoyed it neat, with a drop of water, and even quite heavily watered (down to about 30% abv). Excellent in every guise.

The name ""An Oa"" (pronounced ""Anne-O"") means ""The O"", in reference to a rounded peninsula on Islay and is a conceit referring to the rounded nature of the dram. Top stuff at a reasonable price.

There’s so many interesting flavors that come together in a rounded out profile, yet it’s hard to keep track of everything going on. It’s thankfully lacking the bitter citrus notes I get from 10. Long finish that wraps it up in a nice little bow. I stay engaged and pick up nuances all the way to the end of each dram. Definitely a whiskey to ponder over. My favorite Ardbeg so far."

I think my problem is the harmony. It's lacking. All the flavor notes are like accomplished soloists, but as a choir... It's not working.

4.0,"This is the newest NAS in Ardbeg’s stable:  An Oa (pronounced ahn-oh).  This is also something new when it comes to Ardbeg production- Solera vatting.  This whisky is made up of undisclosed aged whisky from PX cask, ex-bourbon cask and new virgin oak casks.  It is collected in a Solera vat before bottling which allows everything to just mingle together while new stock is added constantly as product is pulled for bottling.  It is advertised as non-chill filtered and I don’t see any info on coloring (which I suspect may be added due to the use of the solera vat, in order to make a consistently colored product.)
It’s bottled at a robust 46.6% ABV and is a typical light gold in the glass.

The nose starts out Ardbeg-y enough:  smoldering campfire, brine, toffee and oak barrel but if you give it some time you begin to pick up some vine-ripened fruits and some mint qualities.

The palate is creamy, but not as deep as the CorryV or the Uggi.  There’s a waxy, tea leaf note that sticks to the tongue before eventually yielding to chocolaty smoke and wood.  The faintest lemon zest and spearmint make an appearance mid sip but at no point does it ruin the mouthfeel.

The finish is medium length with a heavy pepper and spice presence that ultimately ends with fading, Ardbeg smoke.

Overall, I rather enjoyed this NAS offering.  It appears as though they are trying to force some complexity into the younger stock by using the Solera vat, though.  Some people may consider that cheating or compensating, and I suppose it is.  I’ve heard rumors this may lead to the demise of the 10 year old and I’m going out on a limb here and saying I’d be okay with that so long as I can still get the Corryvreckan or Uigeadail when I want those deep, rich Ardbeg experiences.  It’s a few bucks more than the 10, which is a bit sad, but it does offer a slight variation on that and I think I prefer this to the experimental stuff like the Dark Cove, as well.  I could see this becoming a staple in my home bar.  Good stuff.  4 stars.  Cheers, my friends."

4.0,"Ardbeg An Oa (Pronounced An-oh the advert is hilarious look it up) is the newest addition to the Core range from the distillery, alongside the 10yr, Corryvreckan and the Uigeadail, this range is also known as the Ultimate Range (oooh fancy). An Oa is a marriage of several different types of casks, PX Sherry (a personal favourite of mine), Virgin oak and first fill Bourbon, the whisky is then put into Ardbeg’s new “French oak gathering vat where they familiarise themselves with each other” (also fancy) to the Tasting!
 
Nose:
It’s the familiar Ardbeg coastal, salty peat on the nose, less medicinal than the standard 10yr with more of a meaty bbq smoke, then peppery dark chocolate and a hint of fresh spearmint (the tiniest bit).
 
Palate
Very chocolate forward with sticky dried fruit coming through from the PX casks, then followed by a boom of salty peat, burnt coffee grounds (in a good way) and a chocolate mintiness (it’s a word) reminiscent of After Eights.
 
Finish
Spicy black pepper, dry salted meat, and more pepper then fresh mint with more pepper (it’s pretty spicy on the finish)
 
Overview
This is an awesome addition to the “Ultimate Range” from Ardbeg, well rounded with plenty going on, less on the medicinal side of peat than the rest of the range but still distinctively Ardbeg. The “several casks” rather than telling us the actual casks is a bit annoying as it would be nice to know the actual ratios, my guess is heavy on the ex-bourbon then just filling in the gaps with the rest. Overall great dram!"

4.0,"Now that the SDT is in a holding pattern between rounds I have time to catch up on a few samples that have been (and continue) accumulating. This sample was provided by @LeeEvolved 

An Oa is the newest member of the Ardbeg core range. Another NAS, and one that is suspected by many to be a replacement for the staple 10 year. Bottled at 46.6% ABV and is non chill filtered and I believe a natural color of yellow gold. 

As expected, there is plenty of peat smoke on the nose. A bit meaty and a bit fruity, but no one aspect really seems to dominate. Lemons, apricots, and some lemonade. Chalky/mineral notes. A little mint/menthol and faint chocolate. Earthy, ashes and the tiniest bit of oak. Some vanilla buttercream and an incredibly faint sherry note. Mostly mineral like wet stones at a beach or salty sea shells. Not very complex and seems quite young. 

Big peat smoke up front on the palate, but that soon fades. In its wake there are lemons, oranges, and apricots. Ashes, overly charred meat like blackened chicken. Like the nose it is very chalky. Some mint and tannins. The chalky aspect becomes dominant. 

Medium to full bodied mouthfeel with a slight oiliness and mouthwatering. 
A medium long finish with peat, smoke, ashes and tannins. 

Well, it’s not terrible, but it’s probably the worst Ardbeg I’ve had. Weak for an Ardbeg, not quite sure why this was introduced as part of their core range. At $60 I think I’d rather buy the 10 and have enough change to get a pizza. 3.75 and thanks again for the sample lee. 
Cheers"
3.0,"I see this as a toned down 10 year. I'm thinking this is Ardbeg's way of making their signature taste more accessible to the masses. That's fine I guess, but I sincerely hope that the rumors that this will replace the 10 are unfounded, as the 10 possesses far more character and appeal to me. I mean... Ardbeg has such a distinct, powerful flavor profile. Doesn't watering it down to make it smoother defeat the purpose?!"

4.0,"Went in to buy the Uigeadail and came out with the An Oa. Not my typical story...but felt adventurous and in the mood to save a few bucks. So to the whisky, I can say there is decent smoke in the bottle when nosing but it lessens in the glass. It smells of the sweeter finish from the various caskings. To compare within my limited exposure, the taste is 40-50 % Lagavulin as to the smoked meat part of it and the Laphroaig peat and seaweed is in attendance as well, but it all rounds up nicely with the sherry influence. This whisky seems to be a fine example of an even compromise between the two worlds of scotch...the peat smoke and the sweeter fruity casking. The finish has a very decent lingering smoke and peat after the sweetness of fruit and floral has faded. I see this as much less of a one-sided affair than many an other fine tasting whisky (I'm thinking Laphroaig 10 here). So I would recommend this to anyone considering a well done blend of the two great influences upon Scotch. If this is what Ardbeg was aiming for, they have hit the mark nicely, especially at this price point. This is an anytime, any day whisky which I find thoroughly satisfying. A toe in the ocean of Islay peat/smoke and a toe in the ocean of sweeter fruit/floral blended very well together. Something tells me the art of making fine whisky such as this is well afoot and may also well serve to diminish the fears that purists (of which I am usually one) have against the consolidation ongoing in the industry. Time and taste will tell.

The Ardbeg Ten is a classic, but it’s also a lot if you’re not in the right mood. The medicinal side of the peated malts, particularly in Ardbeg and Laphroig (or Octomore if you’re in a higher tax bracket than I am) can be a turn off to most folks. That’s where I feel like this expression from Ardbeg shines. 

The peat is still there. On the nose, on the palate, and on the finish it lingers plenty long. This is Ardbeg after all. But there’s a roundness to this relatively young spirit (no age statement provided) that makes it more accessible than the standard Ten. This is likely due to the PX sherry cask influence, which gives the standard Ardbeg a sticky, sweet roundness that oddly complements the peat. 

Some folks think that peat and sherry don’t mix and exist at two different ends of the single malt spectrum, but this malt (among others...) proves that wrong, and in the right hands, the combination of the two elements can create something magical."

4.5,"nez: un sucre fumé style bbq. poivré en fait. un sucre poivré. une tourbe maritime style Ardbeg.

Bouche: piment vert, poivre, sel, fumé, sauce poisson asiatique. un poivre qui rappel celui de talisker. le piment vert qui rappelle celui du lagavulin 12 ou du Naddura first fill. 

final : sur le poivre, le sel et le cigare.

overall : une belle expression différentes d'un Ardbeg conventionnelle. On dit que c'est le début d'une nouvelle génération de Ardbeg pour plaire a la nouvelle génération d'amateur. Ce qui me semble cohérent. Une belle complexité, un lot de saveur aromatiques inhabituel pour Ardbeg avec la tourbe typiques Ardbeg. j'aime beaucoup! le taux est perdait pour l'expression aromatique. le prix est un peu cher ici au Québec mais le prix hors-SAQ est selon très respectable. 90%"

4.0,"Was super excited about this when a friend decided to uncork his bottle. We poured two drams, let it sit for a couple of minutes and then jumped in. Biggest disappointment to an Ardbeg I've ever had. Almost nothing on the nose, the palette was bland and the finish was gone in a blink of an eye.

Frustrated, we added 3 drops of water and waited 5 minutes.

WOW! What a difference a few drops of water made. All of a sudden it became an Ardbeg. The nose popped of smoke and brine. We had to make sure we hadn't poured something else because it was so shocking. On the palette it came alive with campfire soot, salt spray and vanilla. Then the finish lingered for a good 8-10 seconds revealing more smokey wasps and a faint cranberry(??) glow.

I'm not sure if this is a 4 star dram, but because of the Phoenix-like transformation it made with just a few drops of water it easily gets that grade from me for the experience alone. This one is a fun one to try with friends."

After a taste there is noticeable maraschino cherry on the nose as well. The palate is sweet grain, honeyed smoke, and brine with bright fruit soaking in it. White peppered apple tamps down the cherry from the brine and fresh picked mint leaf blooms out with an earthy tinge before the honeyed barley and apple closes out the session. This is a great Islay for Speyside drinkers and I found that it fills an interesting niche in the collection, although it was also slightly more forgettable (but pleasant) when tried alongside the Uigeadail."

4.5,"A very pleasant surprise. I thought that because it was a few bucks cheaper than the 10 that it was going to be pretty basic. But it’s actually surprisingly complex. It may not be as complex as other Islay whiskies or even other Ardbegs, but for the price it is extremely good. Compared to the 10, the flavors are more pinpoint and dense. You still get a lot of smoke, brine, and sea salt quality, but they are more focused. The 10’s smoke might be more bright and sharp, but the An Oa’s smoke manages to be more manageable while being just as pungent. A very very good “not-your-classic-10/12-year-standard-whisky.” Great for something different. For people who like the path this takes from the standard 10, I recommend trying the Talisker Storm compared to the standard Talisker 10. Both the Ardbeg An Oa and the Talisker Storm are great (cheaper in most markets) alternates to the whiskies upon which they’re based."

4.0,"Nose: An Oa begins with a powerful note of oily, dense peat smoke that can be somewhat difficult for the inexperienced to move past. Those who can are rewarded with a mineral salinity, bright flashes of lemon and cedar, with a beautiful finish of vanilla and anise.

Taste: A smooth marble of smoke, oak, and butterscotch is my initial impression of An Oa on the tongue, with some edge eccentricities of barrel char and iodine. With a little bit of water to crack it open, you find a creamy center of honey and maple candied bacon with a dash of cayenne.

Ardbeg An Oa has a lingering finish of rising  smoke and smooth, sweet butterscotch with an oily, dense body."

4.0,"I bought this bottle so I could complete going through the Ardbeg core range.  As a fan of all things Islay and especially Ardbeg I was quite excited.  Based on the descriptions and the blending process I was hoping it would slot in between the Ardbeg 10 yr and the Uigedal as far as flavour profile and smoothness but I was a little disappointed on that.  The blending process seems to have muted some of the raw smoky power of the 10 year old and it doesn't have near the complexity that the Uigedal has.  It's still a nice dram with layers of peat, brine and a hint of citrus and had I not had such high expectations of it it would have been great.  For those looking to round out their Ardbeg portfolio it's still worth getting but as a staple Ardbeg to have in the cabinet I would either stick with the 10 yr or if I had the budget for it go with either the sublime Uigedal or the heavier hitter Corryvreckan."

Crazy legs on the glass but initial taste is not crazy oily surprisingly.

Taste: initial taste swallowing without holding it in my mouth is just pure smoke and peat with hints of what's in the glass on the tongue. After letting it open up overtime and acclimating to the smoke the chocolate taste is HUGE for me on this one and finishes with a bit of a barrel spicy/spikey end with a taste that lingers forever!

With just a super small drop of water drinking it neat the flavors definitely open up and the spice at the end comes forward a little bit too! Fun complex whiskey to try and pick apart all night."

4.5,"Ardbeg, you continue to impress the hell out of me. Still my top favorite peated Scotch distillery. This expression of their single malts is just as amazing as the rest. However, it is the most different of all I have tasted thus far. 

Nose: heavy smoke and peat. Black pepper and brine dominate next. A sweet vegetal note is there. Somewhere between seaweed and collard greens. At the end there is a refreshing mint sent that I can’t quite grasp. Not spearmint, but somewhere between peppermint and menthol. 

Taste: immediate butter scotch malt flavor that is almost immediately overtaken by smoke and strong peat. A strong dose of black pepper dominates the mid pallet followed by what I can only explain as salted prime rib, or corned beef. The finish is strange but nice. I almost get an almond nuttiness, and the taste of salt water spray you get from being at the beach on a windy day. 

I was a little thrown off by this one. Once I knew it was aged in sherry casks and finished in French oak casks, I expected it to be sweeter and honey dominate. Instead it’s probably the richest/most savory Ardbeg expression I’ve had to date. Very, very well done."

4.5,"Straw color, a bit hazy, medium to low viscosity - something you would expect from a relatively young non-chill-filtered and non-colored dram. Nose is rich with charcoal peat (hey, it’s Ardbeg after all), briny notes, and a bit of a sweet floral character way on the back. Palate is rich with intense smoke, vanilla, oak, and sherry-like sweetness. After that initial sip your nose gets more used to smoke, and more fruit notes start to appear with some apple, caramel, and vanilla rounding the dram. Aftertaste is long and dominated by smoke. This time is gains more medicinal and iodine character. A few drops of water in this 46% ABV whisky dampens the smoke and opens more floral sweetness. Hints of lemon zest also start appearing. The finish becomes less intense and a bit more balanced. Overall, this is a pleasant dram for peat lovers. It has all the character of a classic 10-year Ardbeg with a bit more sweetness that compliments it quite well."
4.0,"Neat in Glencairn at home.  Nose has smoke and brine, as expected for an Ardbeg, though somewhat muted, and is joined by some spearmint and clove.  Interesting.  Taste is dry and peppery, with smoke over top of meadow grass, orange peel, more pepper and mint that continue in the long finish.  Good, but I like the more straightforward punch of the Ten.  

Adding a couple drops of water, though, does bring out the smoke and brine over the pepper and mint, and becomes surprisingly less complex but yet more enjoyable.  With the addition of a few drops of water, this meets my high expectations for this fantastic distiller.  10/8/19"

4.25,"So... this seems to be the least favorite from Ardbeg core range, at least amongst us hardcore whisky fans.

I beg to disagree! While I would have some difficult to rank them (10, An Oa, Uige and Corry) on any particular order as I love them all, I would say this one is at least as good as it companions.

This is so complex that some could call it a chameleon whisky... 
First time I opened the bottle all I got was smoky banana pudding and a creamy sweetness background. Some weeks later I got some lemon citrus with peat/smoke background and I could swear it was the TEN I was smelling... Today I’m sipping it again and as I’m trying to focus very hard on my senses, I can get a very big cloves and cigar ash aroma... May seem weird but it’s great! Ahhhh, we whisky geeks may sound crazy sometimes... ;)

On the mouth this one is very creamy, with a great mouthfeel and has that familiar heavy smoky/peaty/ashy Ardbeg taste that we all love but this time some extra sweetness tag along, probably from the PX Casks in the mix.

The aftertaste is ashy and a little bit more bitter than I like, but nothing that spoils the ride. 

Overall another stellar dram from Ardbeg. Highly recommended!"

4.25,"Nose: Earthy peat and light ash.  Subtly musty funk, creamy - vanilla bean ice cream.  White pepper, chipotle peppers.  Peppermint.  Honey ham.  Toasted cereal grains.  Figs, dates, bananas.  Dried thyme and basil.  Slightly floral - just a hint of a bright perfume.

Palate: Peat, smoke, tannin.  Dense with a sprinkling of ash from a fire that just finished.  Bowl of vanilla yogurt and granola with honey and sliced bananas and blueberries.  Salty ham.  The casks are all showing up here - vanilla, brown sugar and straight oak, slightly tannic, dense and ripe/overripe fruits.  Along with some more tamed character like you'd expect from, say Ardbeg 10.  Finish begins with a phenol- and brightly ethanol-powered pop.  As the sparkles subside, you get that ashy, toasted grain, and honeyed characteristic - Highland Park 12 and Laphroaig 10/Quarter Cask would be apt comparisons.  Things eventually settle into a beautiful creamy, vanilla, cocoa powder landing.  Decent oil means the finish on this is medium long.

Other notes: An Oa is exemplary of what a distillery is capable of when they get creative with their casks and blending.  Admittedly not my favorite Ardbeg, it's still something I enjoy and appreciate whenever I have it, even if it doesn't have a permanent home in my collection.  I still occasionally re-buy this just because it's, objectively, damn good."

Needless to say, peat immediately arrives on the nose, gentler than usual but still ashes, of burnt wood, with notes of raisins, vanilla, a touch of lemon and apple. The ocean appears a little muted in the background. Ardbeg, but different from the usual.
The palate is warm and welcoming, with an initial alcoholic puncture, continuing in the wake of the lit bonfire on which caramelized oranges, licorice sticks, lemon zest, a pepper au gratin and a handful of seaweed are roasted. All very peaceful, smooth, without the muscle tone of other bottlings of the distillery. However, the burnt wood component tends to prevail.
And in fact, in the end it is the ash that accompanies us for a long time, with a touch of licorice and pepper."

Smoky malt and menthol with salty wood and raw vanilla. Its a scooch hot but who cares its delicious. Finish is of course long islay bbq smoke and peaty malt with salted sunken shiplap.

There is also a vegetal pepper that reminds me of Port Charlotte 10. At the end of the bottle the whisky becomes more smooth but the salt doubles in fold. An interesting bottle from Ardbeg."

4.5,"Sweet velvety minty peat, with black pepper and smoke"
3.25,"Very peated and smoked as it’s 10 YO version, much more stronger (because it is only 3 years aged). It is very sweet because of PX casks. Good experiment."
3.75,Quite ashy. Still the lovely type of Islay we love from Ardbeg.

4.5,"Amazing. It's only downside is it's not as smokey as the 10. But at the same time it shines in it's own right! Sweet molasas, with hints of mint and chocolate on the pallet. Got a nice sweet finish with a litter lingering mint note.  Super smooth and refreshing. Amazing is a good word for it."

3.5,"Excited to try this dram.

Nose- of course the classic smoke, beef jerky, not as strong as laphroiag, no hint of alcohol burn. I have to get in close to really pull the nose. Rubbery nitrile. 

Taste- interestingly enough I get wood notes before I get the smoke flavor, coffee grounds, oak, walnut. Lots of dark and heavy flavors here. I can definitely taste the mint chocolate finish. 

Update: 03/18- I taste nothing but peanut buttery finish. Was surprised by this. Yummy taste. 

Mouthfeel- medium and waxy, leaves a short burn in the throat. 

Verdict, I prefer Laphroaig and lagavulin over this. Both give me a end of night dessert feel, this feels a little unfinished. Something I’d drink if I just wanted to drink, but not necessarily sit and give much thought to."

4.0,"When first poured, peat dominates — trademark Ardbeg peat, earthy, medicinal, herbaceous, full, with notes like struck match and cigar ash — but give it a little time in the glass and the unmistakable whiff of sherry emerges as peaty smokiness is dialed down.

In the palate it opens up with a dab of sherried sweetness, followed by strong smoky peat as described above, and then by a little more sweetness and a finish rich in black pepper."

4.25,"This relatively new release from Ardbeg is a very nice expression (most islay whiskies are), very traditional on the taste and aromas from the famous islay, that can be summarized in one phrase: it is the softer, smoother ardbeg i have had, at least on the palate. 46.6%abv, pale straw color.

Everything is typical from islay. The nose notes were: peat, wet socks, burnt rubber, pepper, salt, creosote, english sauce and medicinal notes. 

On the palate is smooth, like bowmore or some taliskers. Salt, pepper, clove, ginger, some old orange peels. Nice. Not harsh at all. Finish is medium with peppery notes. 

Overall this dram feels like a smooth ardbeg 10yo, easier to drink. It deserves at least a 88 over 100."

3.75,"Nose is butterscotch, smoke (although less than I expected), ham,and a touch of citrus.

Taste is a smooth and complex blend of peat smoke, black pepper, slight sweetness, and seaweed.

Finish is fairly hot with smoke and brine."

4.0,"Ardbeg day testing!

Ardbeg 10, An Oa and Grooves

Let’s start here – All delicious and all worth buying.  

The An Oa has hints of new oak, and even French oak, with a nice spicy finish.  The finish is longer than the 10 and spicier.  The palette on the An Oa rolls a bit more and is little less brash and is more balanced.  The PX sherry takes the smoke and makes a pleasant whisky.  An Oa takes the win over the 10. 

The Grooves is sweeter, almost a bit of sticky wine finish.  The finish is longer than the An Oa and a bit better.  Sweet, balanced, lovely finish, a slight advantage over the An Oa. The win versus An Oa depends on your palette. If you like red wine the Grooves wins.  If you like bourbon the An Oa wins (I get some virgin oak impacts on the An Oa). 

Rankings 1. Grooves – due to the longer finish and a bit sweeter than the An Oa, 2 An Oa – better balance than the 10 and much better finish and 3. 10 – solid dram with aggressive smoke that is so easy to like.  All so good.  

I’d I was buying, I would pick An Oa.  If if was a gift I would pick Grooves."

3.5,My first true peated scotch. Not sure I was ready. Will try again with a splash of water.
4.25,"The nose is a muddy, boggy peat. Gas station fumes from diesel. And a dry smoky coal.

The taste is lots of smoke. Bonfire, firecracker plumes and car exhaust. (I mean all of these in a good way.) Cigar ashes and pipe tobacco. A definite chalky, dry quality to the entire operation, as expected.

The finish is chimney soot, charred meat, a shiny leather couch. You can really just let this one luxuriate on your palate for a while. It mellows out beautifully into smoldering embers.

I'm surprised that this one isn't as complex as I had expected -- it's a peat bomb -- but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. It is a superior Islay Scotch."

3.5,"Smoke and a bit of iodine/plastic. Lighter body, with more campfire smoke. Finish surprisingly smooth, with lingering ash. Had this in a blind tasting, and was surprised to learn it was Ardbeg. Way lighter and with fewer Band-Aids than I expect from them!"
4.0,"Guess I’m part of the cult now. This is my 5th ardbeg taste, my third full bottle. Oogy is probably still my favorite, and it’s hard to beat the classic 10 for its workmanlike performance. But there’s something interesting in the An Oa that intrigues me. There’s the signature smoke, this time from a fireplace that’s been dormant for a few days but doesn’t take much to stir up the ash and rekindle the scent of campfire. But what’s that in the background?  A chocolate mint? Did someone throw one of those in the fire, so it melted into the wood and flavored the ash?

Sure it’s a bit young, and thin. And the finish is brief if interesting. But I’d have another."
