5.0,"Chocolate, coffee"
3.5,"Light gold in colour. Fruitiness with some vanilla and maple on the nose. Despite the addition of water, still lacking some smoothness.  Tastes young. Some vanilla notes and a subsequent peppery spiciness. medium finish with a nice woody bitterness.  Not a bad overall whisky but definitely not overly smooth even with some added water. The single cask series is neat nonetheless!"
