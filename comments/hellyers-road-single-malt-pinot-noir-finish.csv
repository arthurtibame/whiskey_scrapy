3.0,Strong wine taste. Didn't like the aftertaste. No malt flavor or smokiness.

4.25,Zesty lemon and orange on the nose. Progresses rapidly to a crescendo of intense fruity sweetness with supporting spices. A more dark berry end to the palate with that strong red wine finish. Might just eclipse the Starward Nova re: wine cask finish.
4.5,Smells slightly of wine and you expect it to taste that way. Pepper and spice fades away to orange rind and currants. Long finish. I liked it.

3.25,"Nose: grapes, musty

Palate: wet dog, gasoline, lemon, smokey,

Finish: finish that last very long. Pinot kicks in which is nice.

Changes for the better the longer you let this sit and open up."

3.5,Blood Orange with a peppery finish.
4.5,"This is really nice. Smooth, rounded. I love it."
2.0,"Nose: Yellow grapefruit zest, wet cardboard, sawdust, white pepper. Rather aggressively spirity. There are red wine notes in the background but it takes a while for them to emerge. [The dry glass aroma is of wine gums and faint sweaty smoke].

Palate: A sweet and fruity arrival that morphs into a dry, almost astringent, winey development. A fierce blast of pepper and chilli with a papery taste. Good texture.

Finish: Medium. Spicy, fading into a bittersweet chocolate aftertaste.

This is fairly young whisky, I'd wager. It does not have great complexity and it benefits greatly from the addition of water and some time to recompose.

Given water and time the nose loses the flat cardboard note, blossoms, and a sweeter floral wine aroma emerges. The alcohol presence is tamed and the red wine cask character shows through more clearly. The palate also develops some sweetness that neutralizes the otherwise forcefully dry character. Overall, water brings balance to this whisky, and is strongly recommended.

On the whole I thought this whisky was more interesting than engaging, and it is a bit overpriced.

""Acceptable"" : 2 stars."
