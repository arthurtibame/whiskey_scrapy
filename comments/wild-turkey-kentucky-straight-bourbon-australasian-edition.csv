4.0,"Premixed 4 pack of cans with cola, my easy go to when I can’t be bothered mixing my own, I like it."
3.0,"Nose: Mild sawdusty-wood notes, vanilla, corn syrup and faint molasses.  Some light spiciness (distant peppermint and clove) and a mere trace of coconut. It's a pleasant nose marred only by the ethanol presence being a little sharp. [The dry glass aroma is sawdust and leather].

Palate: Oily and spicy/sweet arrival. The development brings out flashes of rye and oak tannin. In the mid palate a prominent spearmint note comes forward supported by clove oil, nutmeg and cinnamon, reminiscent of the nose. The texture is reasonable.

Finish: Medium. Dry, but not sour, and mildly bitter like dark chocolate. The aftertaste is oaky.

It's a year since I last had this bourbon and there has been little change to the profile, so it appears to be a consistent expression. From my previous notes it seems like if there is any variation this most recent bottle is a trifle spicier than the last one.

The nose can seem a little too ethanol-forward at first but it improves substantially if you let it stand and develop in the glass for 5 minutes - try it if you don't believe me - it becomes much denser with more oaky and leathery notes, and gains some honeyed spiciness. It's a good combination of well balanced elements.

I've made a new listing for this popular whisky to distinguish the version that is sold in Australasia from the U.S. version, as there are subtle but important differences and having tasted both I feel that for once the version we get out here is pretty good.

Wild Turkey Kentucky Straight Bourbon as sold in the U.S. (and I think in the U.K. and Europe) is 40.5% abv and a rebrand  of Wild Turkey 81 (which was probably withdrawn as in comparison to the ""101"" expression the name sounded weak and underpowered).

However in the Australasian-Pacific region Wild Turkey Kentucky Straight Bourbon is a rebrand of the old ""Wild Turkey Old No. 8"" as it was called in the 1980s and later renamed as ""Wild Turkey 8 Year Old"" (in both 86.8 and 101 proof versions).

The age statement was dropped about 20 years ago but for some reason we never stopped getting the 86.8 proof bottling, except now it is a 6-8 year old NAS called simply ""Kentucky Straight Bourbon"". Whatever the name and history, this is arguably the best bottom-shelf bourbon you can buy in our region and if you're on a budget it's good value for money and highly recommended.

""Above Average"" : 3 stars"
