2.75,"Ok so Im back trying blended scotch again. Truth be told I saw a youtube review on this by the ""sommelier and the mooch"" ha these guys are a riot. I actually work just a couple miles from these guys ""whiskey academy"" in South Austin. I put a lot more stock in this site with excellent reviewers that I enjoy and appreciate their opinions. Well anyway they said this was good stuff , I saw it for $20 at specs so what the hell. This blend has some going for it. Its 100 pf(rare for scotch) non chill-filtered(love that) and supposedly high malt/grain ratio. Poured neat, nose is melted butter, light red apple, good dose of malt, some wood and hit of grain. Pretty standard stuff for a decent blend. Palate is where it comes alive. Blast of butterscotch malt, woody vanilla and lively grain. There is some heat and rawness with an ethanol edge but the flavor overrides this to a degree. Doesn't bring peat but you can imagine a light smoke if you try. Finishes drying malt and oak with fading vanilla and some bitter grain twang. Overall this delivers a good tasty punch and at price I paid is good value. If you like blended scotch this will probably work as its like a good budget brand amped up to 100 pf. I prefer single malts but I appreciate what this is bringing to the table and might repurchase as a low cost blend with some power...........78/100 blend score......probably good as a mixer with strong proof and flavor..........don't pay more than 25$ though"

• Taste - almost flavorless, then sour, then hot. Not good. Nope."
