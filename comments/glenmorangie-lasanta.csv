4.0,"Look: Burnt orange, a bit darker than Glenmorangie 10, Lasanta shows the influence of two more years in a barrel. Translucent, plenty of lacing and some alcohol legs. 

Nose: There’s your typical scotch pear and vanilla that hits me, but also an addition of sherry notes - dark fruits, berries, and surprisingly some smoke. Inhaling fairly deeply, you can get some spice notes as well. 

Palate: Dark fruit berries, slight vanilla, but not the pear orange that I get from the base so much. Letting the scotch settle on the tongue gives more mild, sweet flavors, and some spice I’d get from a lot of rye heavy bourbons. 

Finish: Barrel, earthy notes and sherry. I also get the bitter earthy flavor you would after eating a grape. The longer I sip, the more I get a chocolate coffee thing going. Medium finish in length, and not especially hot. 

Overall: I like Lasanta, but I’m not sure I like it as much as Glenmorangie 10.  The sherry really adds a new layer to the whiskey, but may take away some flavors."

finale : brûlures d'alcool et fruits secs. relativement courte.

2.5,"It may be the case that the additional two years in the Sherry cask are just too much for the 10 year original juice. I remember an episode that ralfy posted a couple years ago critiquing a sherry finished malt in which the cloak of Sherry influence completely took over any other character in the malt, and that's what happened here.

Very sweet nose of grape must, raisins, light brown sugar, balsamic. Very sweet palate of similar notes, slightly cloying. Quick finish. This is so off balance from the weighty sherry cask.

Even though the 10 year is a fairly quiet and soft whisky, I'd take its superior balance and more moderate sweetness over this one."

That breaks down to $8.74 for each, which is overpriced for the original but decent value to try the Lasanta. (In NC the 750 mL is $54.95.) The Lasanta barely beats out the Quinta Ruban, mainly on taste and finish. The nose is more subtle, you need to deeply inhale to get the same effect as a whiff from the Quinta. However, it tastes of a Christmas dessert with nuts and dried fruits, and not as sticky on the finish. I really enjoyed this taster pack, but damn are Glenmorangie options expensive. If you buy a bottle, I recommend everything but the Nectar."

• The sweetness is immediately apparent with notes of sherry, snickerdoodle, floral, and a little blueberry. The floral notes continue as more lovely smells arise. Slight tannic notes are present, but are less apparent than the Original 10 year. Some honey notes waft in and continue the floral character.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Taste
• Momentarily very sweet, but quickly develops a wonderful complexity, blending notes of flowers, spices, honey, malt, and oak. The spices are more floral and herbacious than peppery. After a few minutes of sipping and savoring, the signature slightly astringent/citric Glenmorangie notes are more apparent, but work well with the spirit instead of overwhelming it.
• The finish of the whiskey is somewhat dry. The sweetness and spices taper off slowly and leave a slight cooling sensation in your mouth. It works with the remaining sweetness to remind you of cake icing.

Overall, I think the sherry finish offers a great window into to the sherried whiskey style and that this offering outclasses the Original 10 Year Glenmorangie by a significant margin. The whiskey is complex, approachable, and quite tasty.

On the nose I am picking up on a mixture of blueberries, acai, honey and a light scent of chocolate with wood musk. The musky smell is a lot less pronounced with this one. The taste is just as sweet as the smell. There is almost a dessert quality to the taste, with notes of chocolate, berries, honeycomb and a touch of salt. There is a taste hidden in there that reminds me of a sweet oatmeal. The finish has a delicate tingle of pepper with a subtle undertone of bitters and rubber."

3.75,"Nose: honey or honeysuckle, almost brown sugar-like, lightest hint of vanilla, hint of savory nuttiness, then dominates with dried fruits. Together it almost reminds me of amaretto for a moment but very quick. Has that moment of that citrus touch from the original 10 year. Front-forward sherry tone, pleasant spice notes. Taste: dried fruits, a hint of that nuttiness, light candied sweetness, boldness of the sherry but not overpowering, spicy notes with a touch of cocoa or dark chocolate. Taste is very similar to the nose."
2.75,"A sweet nose with a hint of brown sugar.  First taste is also sweet, with enough peat to make it interesting.  But the finish is a little weak and fades quickly into a faint bitterness.  Subsequent sips are never quite as satisfying as the first sip.  The peat becomes less noticeable and it becomes a game of replacing the aftertaste with a fresh sip.  What’s good about it is pretty good, but not my favorite.  I bought this on a whim instead of my go-to Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban.  Glad I tried it, but will be returning to GQR next time."

Palate is rich and sweet, with raisins, sherry, vanilla, and oak. Finish is medium but sweet and fruity. You can definitely tell the sherry cask influence. Some water in this 43% ABV dram somewhat dulls it. It tames it quite a bit and presents less of everything. Finish shortens quite a bit as well. I wouldn’t add water to this one next time. Overall, this is a rich and sweet dram for sherry lovers. It’s not too complex, but it presents well and is quite enjoyable. Was a part of the 3 bottle package at Costco for $99. Well worth the price."

Finish:  Quite a bit of sweet barrel char, light cloves and tobacco almost like a clove cigarette, finishes sweeter than the other varieties.

This one is nice.  I approve of the sherry finish and not too funky which I sometimes find off putting."

So I am hitting the local supermarket as the wife and kids want ice cream and I see this for $45! In my market it typically sells for close to $60 so I decided to grab it. Let's see if it's any good:
On the palette it's pretty rich with a decent mouthfeel. Rich caramel and honey notes give way to natural vanilla and plums. Some oak spice kicks in and then a decent red fruit driven finish. Quite a nice dram. Definitely on the sweeter side but well executed. Honestly outside of the Glendro 12 I don't know too many entry level Sherried malts I'd recommend over this. Not too complex but very drinkable for a great price!

4.25,"With my review of the Lasanta, I've now reviewed entire lineup of the original Glenmorangie 12 year bottlings. Interestingly, this is the only of the three that has remained untouched after the revamp. This one is in the old packaging (the maroon one).

Nose: Sherry is immediately prominent. Red berry, date, fig, raisin, and plum.  Also some more generic Highland notes such as caramel, toffee, honey, and apple. Sweet and floral. Some cereal and perfume. Over time, a jam note appears. Rich in flavor but very approachable. Sweet and very interesting.

Palate: Sherry-rich once again. Leather, white grape, date, fig, raisin, and plum. Vanilla, caramel, and toffee. A bit of clementine-esque citrus. Some apple and jam. A very slight milk chocolate note, but far less than I get on other well-aged sherry-influenced malts. Similar to the palate, it's easy-going but complex enough to hold my attention.

Finish: Much like with the Quinta Ruban, there is a bit of drop-off here. It makes more sense with this one, considering it's the lowest of the 3 12 year olds at 43% ABV. Plum and the other dry-red fruit notes persist from the palate. Then, for the first time, I get some cinnamon and oak kick. A bit of clove, nutmeg, and pepper as well. It's short-to-moderate in length. Doesn't really add much to the experience.

Overall: Great bang for buck here. This one ran me $53, and it's a damn good value at that price point. Nothing out of the ordinary, but at the same time, this one hits all the right notes. The nose, if anything, is worthy of significant praise. Glad to see it's being kept in tact as Glenmorangie transitions its portfolio to a new format.

And that's my stamp on the 12-year line from GlenMo. It had a good run, and once the scavengers pick the scraps from the shelves, it'll be all but gone. This is significant to me because the Glenmorangie core 4 were some of the first single malts I've ever tried.

My analysis? These three Scotches did exactly what they were supposed to. Three role players. Glenmorangie took zero risks with these expressions, but also took no shortcuts. The result were rich, balanced whiskies that could be enjoyed by the masses and dissected by the experts.

And at the very least, I'm glad this one made the cut for the new generation of the GlenMo standard lineup."

4.25,"This is a very good sherry finished Scotch. It is not my favorite---I don't think the floral-fruity profile of Glenmorangie works as well with a sherry finish as the malted-honey of GlenDronach or Glenfarclas. Nevertheless, this is a fantastic malt. The expected floral and fruity notes of the Glenmo 10 are obviously there, and accented with a lovely sherry finish. This is not my favorite, but it is very good, can be found easily, and, if you shop carefully, it is somewhat affordable"

Not bad by any means, still way better than the majority of drinkers say, but I have to bump it down to 4.0. It’s more nuanced and interesting than the Bacalta that I’m drinking at the same time, but it doesn’t hold up to the Quinta. 
Wow, this is surprisingly up there with the Quinta for me. Where the Quinta Ruban is bolder, with darker fruits taking center stage (blackberry, black currant, plum), this scotch is full of a little bit lighter fruits (raspberry, blueberry, strawberry). It’s as smooth, if not smoother than the Quinta. It has a slight bitterness that I've found to be characteristic of sherried scotches that detracts from the experience slightly. After hearing bad to average reviews, I didn’t expect much. It’s much better than advertised."

Signature Speyside tastes, with some peppery or spicey additions.  Not a lot, but enough to let you know it's been seasoned.  Overall an enjoyable Scotch that I enjoy at this price point.

Finish: 6, 1-10

Overall Score: 6 or 7, depends on the day on a 1-10.  I enjoy this scotch.  It's a scotch currently in my bar.  Good one to share, and also enjoy slowly solo after a long day, or just cause :). I am excited to try other Glenmorangie drams."

3.0,"On a taste it's a little prickly from spirits, sweet, honey and toffee, dried fruits as usual for sherry casks after these tastes appear some bitter notes. Aftertaste very short and isn't interesting. In the end I don't understand why does this whisky cost more then 50$ for 0,7 l bottle there're nothing interesting for this price."

4.25,It tastes and smells like a gingerbread cookie that's accompanied with an almond and hazelnut coffee with a sprinkle of amaretto around the corner waiting. Very tasty and highly recommended!
