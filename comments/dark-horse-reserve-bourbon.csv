2.0,Ends more than a bit astringent. Corn is very sweet with a touch of sour. Put this on ice and it gets better. Little bit of pepper.
2.0,Not a bad rye for the price. But keep this one around for mixers and save your glasses for something that has a little more substance to it.

2.0,"This bourbon has an almost watery taste. The alcohol burn comes on fast and leaves just as quickly. It leaves you wondering whether you actually tried it. It is a nice looking bottle and would make an upscale Manhattan, but I'm not rushing to pick up another bottle."

null,"80/20/0 - Smokey aftertaste, good with ginger ale"
4.0,"30 gallon Casks, not 15. Lenexa is 15min. From downtown KC and well within the Kansas City Metropolitan area. Thanks for the unbiased reviews. You guys should stick to the facts under product description category. A name is a name. If you don't like us using ""Reserve"" then let your audience decide. Don't start us off by drawing a negative picture for everyone using your App. I love the idea of what you have going here, but seems a little biased on the part of your creators. I give your App 1 star for lack of leadership and industry professionalism."

2.5,Spice is firmest in this bourbon. You feel the warmth all the way down. Oaky aftertaste lingers.  Not really a dippers whisky shoot it or mix it.

3.0,"Now rebranded as ""Union Horse"" (perhaps due to Alberta dark horse?).  Somewhat hot and sharp.  A nice complex taste, but could be smoother.  Some dried fruit, subtle sherry, and wood notes."

4.0,"More sweet than spicy with a bit of smoke. Full, smooth mouthfeel - lingering on the palate. I prefer this to some higher rated bourbons like Four Roses Small Batch."
