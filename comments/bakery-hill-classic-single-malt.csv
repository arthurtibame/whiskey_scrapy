3.0,"Bakery Hill tasting event, Sydney, 18 February 2020, Whisky #1

Nose: Bright, gristy cereal, fresh yeasty white bread, lightly fruity and floral, a touch of honey. Intensely spirit driven with barely a trace of cask. Fresh and crisp – almost brittle.

Palate: Firm, bright arrival that again focuses squarely on a clean cereal profile. Very crisp with some malty notes but I thought there was little development apart from considerable heat that arises in mid-palate and obscures things a little. The texture is on the oily side of neutral. Like the nose, the palate is spirit-driven.

Finish: Medium/short. Light, dry semi-sweet flavours that trail out into a sweet cereal aftertaste.

I’ve only tasted one Bakery Hill prior to this (the Sovereign Smoke which I enjoyed a lot and rated at 4 stars here) so I’d expected a little more from this core-range whisky. It’s certainly a very clean and direct spirit but also rather simple. My immediate thought on tasting it was “so what’s all the fuss about?” and I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was somehow missing.

Adding a dash of water initially improved things by expanding the profile and adding a little sweetness (as it always does) but over time a feinty wet-cardboard character emerged. I thought it was better than just “average”, but not by a lot and I know the distillery is capable of much more. At the asking price (US$110 for a 500ml bottle!) I really didn’t think this represents good value.

“Above Average” : 3 stars

Whiskies #2-#7

I had the Classic Single Malt last night at a Bakery Hill tasting event in Sydney presented by Andrew Baker, one of the distillery owners and son of the founder and head distiller, David Baker. I’ll only be reviewing that one expression in depth as the other six were cask-drawn unfiltered previews of two coming limited releases and four experimental batches, which I’ll outline below.

The tasting event was with a focus group of 18 whisky enthusiasts and was partly an opportunity for David to get some feedback regarding their proposed releases for the coming year.

The two expressions that will definitely be released are a 48% abv 5 year old that has been finished for 12 months in stout barrels (scheduled for May 2020), and a 46% abv very lightly peated 11year old fully matured in ex-bourbon (scheduled for early 2020). The stout barrel expression left me a bit cold [2 stars] and was not particularly popular.

However, the 11 year old was very good [3.75-4 stars] and is definitely one to look out for. I thought it was far and away the best whisky of the night, as did almost everyone else at the tasting.

The four experimental expressions were:
* a cask strength 60% abv version of their core Double Wood expression (5 years in ex-bourbon, 1 year in French oak) [3 stars]
* a 44% lightly peated expression (2 years in French oak, 5 years in ex-bourbon) [3 stars]
* a 52% unpeated expression (5 years in ex-bourbon, 18 months in a sherry quarter cask cask) [3.5 stars - very good nose, average palate]
* a 50% abv lightly peated expression (5 years in ex-bourbon, 1 year in a 200 litre ex-muscat barrel) [3 stars]"

3.5,"I tried the peated variety of this Distillery last year in ChCh NZ and really quite enjoyed it despite its lighter speyside profile. I was in Melbourne and staying only 20 minutes down the road from the distillery. Sadly there were no tours when I was there over xmas and NY but I thought why not ring them up and see anyhow. Long story short they were on a holiday season break but doing a bit of a tidy up and the founder / owner David invited me to pop in. It's not often you get to sit down with a founder in his distillery, have a good chat and drink their range of whiskies. David was a very lovely fellow and had lots of very interesting info which I'll spread out over the reviews of his other whiskies. I'm not a speyside profile person but this was nice, predominantly green apple, malt and vanilla. I'd say I preferred the rest in the range more though."
