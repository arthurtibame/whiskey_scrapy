3.75,"Nose: Light citrus, Orange and pineapple on a base of yeast dough
Pallet: First citrus. Then there is the warm taste of mashed potatoes that linger in your mouth. Going back to the nose, after tasting, reveals more of the potatoes and bread aromas.
Finish: Short to Medium with that same mashed potatoe

Very interesting dram due to the mashed potatoe and dough flavours. Also very easy on the pallet considering the age and ABV."
