3.5,"My first tomintoul was this 16yo expression, and it was a normal, not remarkable whisky, that has a little peatiness. 

On the nose there are apple and honey notes. Not much else but nothing off-putting either. The palate is full of apples with a dim earthy peat.

Aftertaste is peppery and ashy, actually nice. Overall this dram deserves a 74 over 100."
3.25,"Nose is vanilla fruit 
Pallet is creamy dough
Finish is soft with a spice on back"
3.5,"Rapid side-to-side nosing reveals berry notes!  A straight nose dip into the glass lends to bourbon-cask and white grape notes.  Palate at 40% ABV is coconut and malt.  Tasty combo, but not terribly complex.    Low ABV does, however, acquiesce to bigger sips!  Light and refreshing.

4.0,"White fruit, apricots, vanilla, light and sweet with honey, tea and faint wisps of lemon citrus.  A rather pleasant nose.  As the dram opens, caramel becomes the dominate note.  On arrival, the same theme of the nose materializes on the palate.  The medium bodied spirit quickly loses the caramel sweetness and reveals orange rind and spice, leaving a slight bitterness on the tongue and a hint of spice and oak. Sweet and fruity on arrival; slightly bitter, spicy and oaky on the finish.  The addition of water (a small amount, since it is a low ABV) diminishes the bitterness and reduces the fullness of the body.  Overall, a nice 'Gentle Dram' presented in a standard Speyside profile manner.  This is a perfect spirit as an introductory Scotch Whisky that is extremely cost-effective (at least near me).  [$48][85/100]. [Opened: 4/11/15; Revisited: 2/12/16]."

3.5,"My review four years ago was as follows: ‘This 'gentle dram' is pretty anodyne.’ I gave it two stars.

After having tasted many more whiskies since, and at a credible friend’s recommendation, I gave this one another shot. Turns out, it’s a pretty impressive value for its age and has notable nuance that either was lacking from the earlier batching or was simply too subtle for me at the time."

4.0,"$70 - Michigan. Nose (Neat): Vanilla, honey, butter and a touch of oak. Palate (Neat):  Light alcohol burn. Tastes of butter, caramel, oak, slight mint and light kiss of freshly baked vienna bread. This is truly a gentle dram, as advertised. I drink a lot of bourbon and scotch over ice, but this is really so gentle that I do not. This is a great gentle scotch for the new adventurers to the scotch world, except for the price. I like it because it is not a complex drink profile. It is just simply easy to enjoy."

3.0,"Interesting. Pleasant, but not my typical choice of taste profile in a whisky. 
Vanilla and lemon rind/zest. A little sweet but also a little.... Bitter?.... I want to say briny, but it's not. Maybe oak or burnt wood? It's certainly interesting, and would be happy enjoying of an evening. 
Can only suggest it is better for summertime than colder weather (imho)"

4.0,"I never knew of Tomintoul; I'm sure I passed by it a dozen times and saw it on the shelf as well, but was kinda blind to it.   It's too bad, cause it's actually quite good.  It's not the complex deep thinking dram like a Brora or a kick-in-your-teeth like a cask strength Laphroaig, but it's a simple,down-to-earth everyday dram that you can pour on any given day.   You get a mild taste of honey, peaches,and caramel.  This kind of reminded me of a Dalwhinnie 15---understated elegance.  Scott: thank you for introducing me to this, and the generous sample!!"

3.0,"Pricey for an entry level quality whiskey. A slightly nutty, grainy aroma. Medium bodied, smooth, slight warmth and flavors of vanilla and just the barest touch of sweetness. One dimensional and straight forward, feeling young for a 16 year old dram."
4.0,"A solid whisky and one I found truly pleasing. While the nose was quite shy and subdued, the palate confidently displayed notes of honey, roasted barley and a touch of hazelnut. And while the finish was unfortunately short, I can still say I enjoyed this dram. At the right price, I'd put my money on a bottle."

3.25,"What happens when a 'blend filler' distillery starts to bottle Single Malts? Right, they get a problem with the caliber of their casks (mainly refill ex-bourbon). Luckily, Tomintoul 16 is more sherry-influenced than its 10-year-old brother. On the nose, you get dark fruits with hints of walnuts and marzipan, heather honey and very distant peatiness. The taste is light and sweet with grainy citrus, cornflakes and some crisp oak. Vanilla, spices and mild tannins accompany the modest finish. An easy sipper that appears younger than the age statement suggests.

3.5,"Nose: Hazelnuts, powdered malt extract, an aroma uncannily like almond Danish pastry. Running in parallel are fruity notes of stewed apples and orange peel. There's also some vanilla, oak and a tiny whiff of peat smoke. [The dry-glass aroma is entirely oak - everything else just floats away].

Palate: Honey-sweet and luscious, mouth-coating and creamy. Vanilla whipped cream, malted milk, hazelnuts, almonds. A very soft and gentle arrival and development without any trace of peat, spice or heat.

Finish: Medium, slightly dry with malty-oak flavours fading into the distance.

Tomintoul 16 is a pleasant and laid back whisky with a soft, smooth profile. The nose is very feel-good in a relaxed lazy Sunday morning sort of way.

Don't add water - it is completely unnecessary and kills the velvety texture.

It's not a bad whisky at all and the price is not steep for a 16 year old expression, but when the experience is this easy you had better be specifically wanting ""smooth' above all else.  While I enjoyed the bottle I had I don’t feel the urge to acquire another or keep it on hand as a regular thing.

“Good” : 3.5 stars"

3.0,"Significantly more rich and sweet on the nose.  Deep red apples, yellow pears and creamy vanilla with a light caramel drizzle.

Very gentle to the palate, just a light coating of honeyed barley.  Flavours of cooked apple and some light citrus enter the mid-palate with a subtle hint of spice.

The finish has a short lingering hint of oak with a thin layer of honey and vanilla."

2.0,"I decided I’d write a quick review of the Tomintoul 16 year old.  I recently bought a 3 pack sampler with the 10, 16 and 25 year old in it and I did a full review on the 10 already, so needless to say there isn’t much difference here.  It’s also bottled at the legal minimum of 40% and has the exact same color as the 10- clearly an indication of artificial coloring use.  It’s golden yellow, and leaves behind some seriously big water droplets on the rim of the tasting glass.

The nose is eerily similar as well:  candied corn, bread and butterscotch although the oak barrel notes aren’t quite as weak as I found on the 10yo.  The palate is still bitter with more overall oak flavor, but less vanilla.  The corn flavor transitions to a soft butterscotch flavor mid sip.  The finish is medium here and it’s not as dry as the 10.  The bitterness is kept in check as well.

Overall, it’s still a pretty weak experience, but the extra 6 years does draw in a deeper flavor profile- it just doesn’t add any extra dimensions.  2.5 stars.  Cheers."

4.0,I purchased this at the distillery. The tour was lead by the operations director Graeme Bowie. How often do you get a tour from the guy who runs the place? He was terrific!! This is bourbon cask aged 100%. Very light throughout the experience of this expression. Light vanilla oak and citrus on the nose. Subtle fruit and sugar cookie on the palate with a brief spice finish. This dram is impossible to dislike.

3.5,"This tastes more like a highland than a Speyside. Good, smooth earthiness that reminds me of dirt pudding (sans gummy worms). Strong grain presence and rich finish. Classic Speyside butterscotch underpins the experience. This drinks like a 16 year. Would absolutely drink it again. Depending on the price, I think it would be a good highland to have around Je house pretty regularly."
