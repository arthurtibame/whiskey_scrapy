0.5,"Tastes like sweet orange candy and a little bit like buttered popcorn. Reminds me of eating off of a movie theater floor. Also, this is exclusively produced for Total Wine, as far as I can tell, so you're better off with pretty much any other Tennessee whiskey (including their Lonehand)."
2.25,"Clean crisp aroma with a rich complex taste consisting of caramel, oak and spice flavors."
1.5,"Nose: oak, grape, orange peel
Taste: candied orange gummies. Personally not pleasant."
