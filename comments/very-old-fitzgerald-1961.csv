4.0,"This might be the most expensive whiskey i have ever tasted since it can reach 8.000 per bottle in some stores. It seems to be that once there was a distillery called Stitzel Weller, run by Julian ""Pappy"" Van Winkle and in 1961 he distilled this whiskey which was bottled in 1969. 

Bottled at 50%abv.

On the nose: chocolate powder, cough syrup and caramel chocolate (The one from Milka).

On the palate milk powder and chocolate notes. Aftertaste is full of oak spice and chocolate.

Actually a good dram, i wouldn't pay 100 for it, (it costs at least 2k, for a 20cl bottle) but in terms of flavor it is easy drinkable an fairly enjoyable. 89/100."
