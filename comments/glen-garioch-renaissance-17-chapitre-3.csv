3.75,"Nose - (w/o water) Floral honey, Chinese dried red dates, sweet incense? dark apple juice, hint of golden raisins (w/ water) More ""bright"" but more boring, golden raisins, ripe apples

Taste - (w/o water) Rich caramel apple juice, hint of chocolate, dark golden raisins, hint of fruity incense (w/ water) Creamy caramel, dark apple juice, sandalwood?

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering sweet yet dry, fresh dates, golden raisins, caramel (w/ water) Gentle ginger heat, light golden raisins, fruity incense

Score - 81/100

Final Thoughts - This was an interesting one. I guess I didn't really get the ""meaty"" notes like I did with their other expressions. This one was quite interesting in that I got these fairly strange notes in it of incense and the Chinese red dates. This seemed to come & go throughout the dram & water didn't seem to help this one as much as others. It did make it seem more ""bright"" but it didn't seem to help it as much.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

4.75,"Majorly different when compared to the 16 y/o. More rounded and oily on mouth and with a more sherry finish. Beautiful whisky. The 18th y/o being even better, if that's possible!"
4.5,"Nose : Quite complex. Earth and vegetation are backed by a bit of spicy vanilla and honeyed apple.

Taste : Simple and beautiful. Malt and honey. Balanced, showing a bit of wood in the long run.

Finish : Finish is powerful, starting with wood, drifting after towards honey slowly.

Simple, but beautifully executed."
