3.5,"Single Cask Nation don’t get a lot of reviews here, and in truth I don’t get to sample their stuff as much as I do the bigger independent bottlers. But thanks to a special offer at my favorite watering hole, I am able to give them a bit of the notice they are due and also get an introduction to another distillery I haven’t encountered before.

This young and punchy Miltonduff has a somewhat funky nose with notes of bananas. It’s perfectly quaffable at its bottled strength and pleasantly oily. Flavors of orange and toasted malt lead to a long and spicy finish. The nose blooms with water, yielding aromas of hay. It’s juicy and lemony in the mouth, then sweet and tangy. Overall, interesting and good value.

One reason I’m happy to give a shout-out to Single Cask Nation is that in addition to bottling good whisky at fair prices they also produce a very informative podcast, One Nation Under Whisky. In fact, it’s the only podcast I always make time to listen to. Check it out if you’re at all interested in the business of making and selling whisky."
