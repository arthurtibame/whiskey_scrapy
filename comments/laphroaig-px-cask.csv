null,Just had this at a pub in Edinburgh.  Fantastic nose which surprisingly did not lead with peat.  It was spicy with a kind-of cigar-smoke bouquet.  It was sweet with a definite peat smoke flavor and was not too alcoholic in either the nose or the tasting.   Loved it!

5.0,"Oh. Sweet. Heaven.  It's like Laphroaig Quarter Cask and Lagavulin Distiller's Edition had a lovechild while bathing in a fountain of Bowmore 12yr.  Seriously.  The nose is leather and barbecue beef, backed up by a sweet salt breeze blowing off the ocean. Dig a little and there's the iodine and peat so famous to Islay.  The palate is remarkably smooth, leading with the brine and seaweed and backed up by a blast of peat, leather and iodine. Swirl it a bit and you'll find a hint of raisins then treacle before the leather, tobacco and peat finish the swallow.  This is exceptional in so many ways; no single note is dominant, and all support the other so that the finished product is so much more than the sum of its parts.  If you're traveling, do yourself a favor and grab a bottle."

5.0,"Ah, the Laphroaig PX triple whammy. If you like islay drams, this is one of the finest.
The nose is surprisingly delicate. Yes, it is peat and bogwater, but it's so well balanced with hints of seaspray, seaweed, citrus, iodine and a rich sweetness from the PX sherry, quite floral actually, and not super  smokey like Lagavulin 16.
The mouthfeel is light and smooth, almost refreshing, but don't be fooled, it kicks in after the jump. Taste is quite smokey, but still sweet, complex and rich. Leather, tart red berries, salt and a bit of toffee - and i love it."

5.0,Peter Kaalund's review nails it. These Laphroaigs that start out smoky and end  up sweet are among my favorites from the distillery. I didn't think much of this based on the taste I had at Duty Free a while back but will definitely pick up a bottle after savouring a sample at home.

4.0,My favourite distillery the px cask is alot milder than what you may expect from laphroaig but it's a lovely change from the norm. On the nose you get a light earthy peat as well as a sweet spice like cinnamon & nutmeg as well as a touch of sherry. On the palate i get a smooth dram again with a lovely Balance of peat & sherry sweetness. The finish medium in length sweet the peat is alot weaker here although I do get a touch of spice & saltiness. Overall I love this dram the hard core peat heads may not but it's a lovely summer dram & ive been enjoying it on our Australian summer nights slainte!!

4.0,"Aromas of briny peat, grilled steak with black pepper, smooth cashew butter... hint of licorice? Smoked citrus on the palate, sharp caramel, sweet oak spices. Finish is earthy, mineral, a light floral carrot note lingers... Slightly ragged and not as sherried as I expected (this ain't no Lagavulin) but very satisfying. Gramercy to the chivalrous Pranay for the sample! Dry glass: the sweet wood-stove smoke and somewhat musty basement of my childhood home."

4.0,"My sincerest apologies to Pranay for taking so long to acknowledge his generosity and to get these tasting notes in for this sample. But Pranay, I lost my notes and just now found them.  I very much enjoyed this whisky. The nose was very much the expected Laphroaig peaty/phenolic/bandaid notes, but easier than the Laph10.  As it sat in the glass, citrus sherry notes developed. Not much of a coating on the glass. On the palate, it was not so easy as the high ABV was evident. There was more smoke flavor than I was anticipating given the nose, and an ashy smoke carried through to the finish. So I added some water which really brought this dram alive. The citrus-sherry nose became sweeter with a nicer smoke presence (imagine eating an orange creamsicle while sitting by a campfire). the sherry was not so evident, but the smoke accompanied some spiciness through a lingering finish. A tiny bit of sweetness at the very end. Dry glass- nutmeg and an Islay tidal pool (not that I actually experienced that, but someday....).  Thank you so much Pranay!"

5.0,"Well, I can tick another bucket list scotch off my list after last night.  A new friend from New Jersey, give it up for Mr. Pranay B, sent me this travel exclusive beauty.  What do you get when you take Laphroiag 10 year old and run it through a quarter cask and finish it in Pedro Ximenez sherry casks?  Laphroiag PX Cask.  The big problem is you have to live near or travel to international lands to find this bottle.  Lucky for me, I made friends with a few people that do.

The PX Cask is the international cousin to the Triple Wood, in that it goes through 3 casks before hitting the bottle and finally onto store shelves.  It's 96 proof, which is higher than both the regular 10 YO and the QC.  It still has those wonderful legs and fills the room with signature smoke once it's resting in the taster.  When you deeply inhale you get the glorious sweetness from the PX casks.  Now, I know what you're thinking...""Lee, dumb ass, the Triple Wood finishes in Oloroso sherry casks and the PX finishes in Pedro Ximenez sherry casks.  Surely there can't be that much of a difference.""  Stop right there, don't call me Shirley, and you are so wrong.  It makes a (Donald Trump) huuuuge difference.  Trust me.  Though, I am still a bit of a dumb ass, I'm definitely in love with this scotch.

The palate is everything you want from an Islay scotch:  peat, campfire coals, sea spray and tobacco.  The sherry cask finishing really shines about mid sip as everything just mellows and turns sweet on you.  Great stuff, but then again, I didn't expect anything less.

The finish may be the only spot where I find anything to nitpick.  The higher proof makes it wash away a little bit rougher than I'd hoped for.  There's just a bit of harshness and burn that, perhaps, wouldn't have been there had it rested a bit longer in the sherry cask or been blended down to 86 proof.  It doesn't ruin anything, mind you, it just causes me to stop and wonder ""what if?"".

Either way, it's a wonderful scotch that I wish was sitting on shelves locally because I'd take this over the Triple Wood and Quarter Cask all day long.  Maybe one day it will or should I get my lazy ass on a plane and see a few places before I depart this rock?  It would make a great souvenir over a snow globe or $20 t-shirt.  In closing, I highly recommend grabbing this when you are near the border or overseas.  It's a great whisky.  Cheers, my friends"

5.0,"As much as I hate business traveling, one of the perks is picking up whiskies not often available state side.  I was lrecently in Manchester, and picked this up from the duty free.  Not bad---$90 for a liter.  II'm still partial to the DE as my hands down favorite (and furthermore, it always reminds me of my late mom's fresh homemade samosas with this spicy smoked tomato tamarind chutney), but this is almost up there.  Modern Drinking and Peter Kaalundi's review nail it---this starts off with a smoky seawater aroma, and the taste then continues starting with brine and smoke, but quickly converts to a sticky smoky sweet, like a Kansas City barbecue.  This is no where as ""grow hair on your chest"" strong smoke like the 16, or the samosas of DE, but I'd say somewhere in between.  If you happen to be coming up on an international trip, save space in the hand luggage for this.  It's well worth it."

3.0,"This is my first experience where I have learned in some cases to listen to the reviews versus the Expert Rating. I'm a Laphroaig fanatic for its intense peat, smoke, iodine, and brine. 10 is my go to dram. Just went on vacation and was able to pick up the PX. The nose is so different from my favorite 10. More alcohol, sweet, just a hint of peat. On first sip the peat, smoke, iodine and brine hit like my old friend the 10, albeit a bit more subdued than the 10.  Do not fret, however, the finish is the most amazing sweetness (I assume from the sherry cask aging).  Then comes leather, salt, and smoke again. Interestingly, the next sips reversed with the sweet leather and salt hitting first. Amazingly complex. This Scotch is a home run. I highly recommend it. Expert rating should be much higher."

Even though this is by Laphroaig, this MAY be the ""droid you're looking for"" indeed. Now, I may miss that trademark ""earthier"" peat at good ole Lagavulin, but hey, this guy dances in between those great bottles. I think this duty free spectacle is underrated."

5.0,"Thanks to Telex for the sample!  PX Cask strikes me as Laphroaig's answer to Ardbeg's ultra-popular and critically acclaimed Uigeadail.  The ABV is a few percentage points lower, so it's a milder dram, but otherwise my notes are very similar.  The nose is replete with sticky sweet sherry notes, cherry cordial, and fruitcake to complement some beeswax and floral peat.  The palate is strawberry sweetness, a really mild peat, and honey.  It is simpler and less complex than Uigeadail, but it also doesn't suffer from the young spirit hint I detect in that Ardbeg.  The finish is sherry-forward again, but with a strong swirl of spices on top of hot chocolate.  Laphroaig PX is an ideal scotch for someone who likes Uigeadail but finds it too intense.  I'd rate it a hair below Uigeadail myself, but it's a close call, depending on mood."

With further deliberation I do pick out some sherry influence on the finish, but you definitely have to search for it."

4.5,"Nose: The initial nosing takes you aback slightly, because it comes on strong with smoke and PX sherry aromas in combination, which works astonishingly well. Raisins, dried peel, baking spice, sherry dunnage and then - POW! - we're whisked away to a seashore at sunset ebb-tide on an autumn evening. The seashore aromas come creeping in - seaweed, iodine, sandy strands and muddy intertidal reaches with mussels and razor shells popping. Curlews crying in the distance while chimney smoke arabesques its way into the still air from cottages silhouetted against the sunset. As the light fades and the evening star rises, hints of steamed beech, cedar, teak and creosote-treated oak reach out from the boats at rest in the mud. The oak pervades the senses and remains as the final impression as night falls. Oh man.

Palate:  Echoing the nose, sherry and smoke are the first components in the delightfully semi-sweet arrival that develops into a magnificently balanced palate with vanilla, fruit cake, cherries, iodine, tar, toffee, liquorice, orange zest, sour peat, caramel, brine, tobacco and leather. Simmering underneath is a potpourri of rich aromatic spices including anise, allspice, cardamom and cinnamon, but it's a subtle foundation that just peeks through to say hello from time to time. What a beautifully busy palate - I feel tired just describing it - and yet it all fits together like a jigsaw to present one peaceful picture.

Finish: A medium-long, smoky sherry, earthy and even vegetal finish, dying out on a wisp of chewy oak. It's like the final echoes of a resounding orchestral finale.

What a great whisky, and IMHO criminally under-rated. A rich, full, rounded and totally integrated dram with immense poise. Contained within a sensuously sumptuous body like an Ingres odalisque, flirtatious and dangerously knowledgeable of her power over the beholder, this whisky is sure of itself, perfectly balanced and cohesive.

The oak finish in particular is a masterpiece, however it is the mid-palate where this truly shines for me, in that it takes everything that is promised in the nose and then delivers that and more as flavour.  I am bowled over that John Campbell could conceive of something so seemingly outré, but once tasted, obvious - but that's genius, isn't it?

Jim Murray (yes, I know - Mr Murray - get over it) describes this as ""A quite beautiful whisky and unquestionably one of the great malts of the year...in spite of itself."" and I get exactly what he means.

I love this whisky - for me it is one of the best Laphroaigs I've ever tasted, and that's saying something. It leaves the contemporary 10 year old and most of the NAS expressions paddling in the kiddie's pool, and is right up there with the elegance of the 15+ year old expressions whilst still preserving a rich, full centre that they, progressively, lose through age. I prefer it to the resinous bludgeon that the Quarter Cask has become recently and it's more interesting than the Triple Wood. 

Now I just need to book a return flight to New Zealand some time soon so I can buy a couple of bottles duty free, because that's the only way to get hold of the darn stuff!

4.0,"Laphroaig was the one. The one that blew my mind and introduced my to the microcosm that is Islay. I’ve had many different expressions from this superb distillery and other that the 18 (which I will try some day soon I hope), this PX Cask is the one for which I have had the highest anticipation. I picked this one up at duty free during one of my many trips over to Windsor. A nice 1L bottle that cost me about $90. I provided this as a sample to everyone in the SDT group even though I believe they’ve all had it before. 

This NAS, travel retail exclusive single malt is bottled at 48% ABV and is non chill filtered. There is some debate out there about whether it has colorant added or not, but all evidence I can find points to it being a natural color of amber with a faint reddish hue. 

The nose has most of the standard Laphroaig profile, but much subdued and covered by the sweetness of the PX casks. The medicinal and tarry notes are there but very mild. Smoke but not heavy peat smoke. The sweetness shows up after some time and starts with toffee and caramel and some vanilla custard. Fruitcake, cherry cordials and some nutmeg. Earthy, brine, anise and even some eucalyptus. I added some water (10-15 drops) and it brought out some really nice fruity notes. Grilled apricots, smoky watermelon, dried banana chips and dark berry jelly donut filling. Some sweet syrupy sherry notes follow and finish off the nose. An ever changing chameleon of awesome. 

The palate is much more intense than the nose lead on, but not at anything approaching too much. Darker than other Laphroaigs. Spicy and sweet, smoky, peat and ashes. Smoky cherries, spiced fruitcake, sherry, anise and burnt honey. Towards the end some beautiful oranges and tangerines come in. Candy sweet at times, but always smoky and peaty. 

A medium to full bodied mouthfeel that is oily and mouthwatering. 
The finish is medium long with peat smoke, spices, anise, charred oak and slightly tannic. 

This bottle was an oddity of an odyssey. When I first opened it I got nothing of the Laphroaig I know and love, just a crazy sweetness and a muted profile. Oxidization brought this one to life rather than killing it. Water was the key to unlocking the fruitiness vs the generic sweetness that is there without it. A very good but understated Laphroaig. If I had rated the bottle upon first tasting it would have been a 3.75 at best. Now with only a few drams left I give it a solid 4.25
Cheers"

On the palate it's full, peaty, campfire, bandaids, medicinal, cinnamon and meaty. The finish is smoke, sherry, a good dry oaky warmth. The time in the Pedro Ximenez sherry cask definitely takes some of the edge off of this whisky compared to the Laphroaig 10. This should get better as you get further into the bottle."

4.0,"A close to the weekend that was rushed and busy.  A pour to slow time is much needed.  Laphroaig is one that has the ability to put time on pause. 

There’s a medicinal, antiseptic opening. A bit of earthy peat or coal tar, but ever so slight, non-Laphroaig-like.  Vanilla extract, nutmeg, custard with a gentle briny and maritime infusion. 

The palate becomes tarry and remains constant and has white pepper weaving throughout.  Baking spices also come alive: cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg.  Burnt toast, smoked cherries.  The body is medium weight and slightly oily.  Water draws the fruity cherry sweetness forward and provides a balance and improves the experience. 

The palate remains ashy and tarry.  Dark roasted coffee and Orange rinds with spicy oak that lingers for an eternity. 

This is a slow sipper for those who enjoy a earthy, peaty, tarry sweetness.  Rich in depth and warming.  Water is key here and the enriches the whisky.  [87/100][Tasted: 6/3/18]"

3.5,"• Nose(undiluted): damp peat, dark fruit (raisins, dates), a hint of cinnamon, some iodine, brine, and a the medicinal/antiseptic note that Laphroaig is known for.

• Palate (undiluted): very soft, rounded, I'm shocked that this is 48% ABV, quite fruity, almost sticky with dates, less smoke than I expect from Laphroaig, subtle coffee notes

• Finish: medium length, malty, oat cakes, somewhat medicinal with a touch of smoke and dates lingering

With water, there's a mineral note that comes out on the nose, like pencil lead. The fruit becomes a bit brighter, with lemons joining the raisins and dates. The palate and finish are almost unchanged with water, there is a slight re-ordering of the flavours, with the smoke being a bit more prominent, but otherwise it stays the same. Add water or don't, it doesn't seem to change much.

This feels like a “summer Laphroaig”, almost like what Select could have been, had they bottled it at a more respectable strength. It’s a bit fruitier and not quite as smoky and medicinal as I want it to be, but it’s a pleasing sipper nonetheless. I won’t try to hunt down a bottle, nor will I reach into my whisky network to source one, but I would certainly purchase one if I came across it at a reasonable price. It's also a bottle I'd be glad to give or receive as a gift. An all-around enjoyable malt. Recommended. 86/100 points"

Palate: peaty, silky and spicy with a bite
Bottom line: a bit too smokey for me!"

3.5,"Nose: classic Laphroaig vampire smoke, but somewhat more muted in its intensity. Plenty of oak as well. And finishing in a faint baked apple notes of dry sherry.

Palate: very nice oily texture that emphasise the initial herbal notes of the dram, but also explodes the iodine and smoke notes as the liquid roll into the back of the mouth. Feels like a more balanced version of the 10yo. 

Finish: dry, a faint lingering of sweet baked apples from a dry sherry.

Water opens up more of the wood notes in the nose and removes much of the smoke from the palate in favour of more vanilla and dry sweetness from the sherry."

4.0,"Initial nose is pure campfire. After sitting for ten minutes the nose takes on more of the sherry finish with a smoky background, interesting juxtaposition. Taste is sweet with fruits and smoke in the finish, which lingers. Overall very enjoyable, a dram to savor!"

5.0,"Nose: Coastal peat smoke, iodine, sweet fruit

Taste: Intense smoke, oily, brine, dark fruit appears on tongue and roof of mouth and stay for the whole finish with lingering smoke."

4.25,"This is a very nice and interesting whiskey, While it's not radically different from the other Laphroaig's I've tried. I do find it to be unique.  It packs in all of the familiar Laphroaig notes, but played at a somewhat lower volume. This actually makes it easier for me to pick up certain notes more readily, like smoked meats  Overall, I find it to be smokey, fruity and creamy.  Interestingly, I consistently get a very mild note of chlorine on the nose.  It's almost like slightly chlorinated fruit.  I've spent a ridiculous portion of my life at pools, so it's a smell I like.  And the overall scent is great. My wife, who loves rums and piscos but not Scotch, gave me an unsolicited, ""that smells really good"".   I tried this with a one ounce sample bottle; I suspect that once I've had the chance to pick it up while traveling I'll find more as I delve in."

4.5,"Rich dark golden amber coloration. The nose definitely the highlight - true to its name (Pedro Ximenez), the sweet sherry stands out  progressing to dried fruit (currants and sultanas) and a hint of vanilla. The traditional Laphroaig peat/smoke shines through on the palate although the sweetness of the PX finish bridles and modulate the peatiness to a gradual crescendo of oaky, peppery spiced finished. The dram warms the chest and lingers. Much like Ardbeg An Oa with the PX finish but much more intense. Prefer this to the An Oa."

4.5,"Laphroaig line-up. Tested Lore, PX and 10 partially blind. I knew what was in the lineup, I just didn’t know which one was which.

What were the differences?

Lore had the best nose and the PX had the most sherry notes. The 10 has the most notes and some elements that are covered by sherry in the other two - earthy and medicinal. 

The PX finish is forever, French Oak spice and intense.  The Lore was very dry on the finish and had hints of yesterday’s firewood.  The 10 didn’t stand up as well, slightly medicinal, light spice and a hint of earthiness.  The PX’s finish is special. 

The overall rankings: 1. PX, 2. Lore, 3. 10.  All good. If you can only buy one, get the PX."
4.25,Sweet and peaty. Spicy and full bodied. Nice long finish. More peat than sherry at first but evens out after a few sips and becomes delightfully warm and pleasant. A great dram for Christmas.
3.25,Nicht so medizinisch wie der 10. Eher fruchtig.

4.0,"Oct 2019.
Clear medium gold.
Aromatic xo brandy, sweet dried figs, roasted longan honey, sweet smoky in nose.
Sweet spicy, red wine tannin, campfire, roasted dark prune, and toasted wild berry in the palate.
Ok balance fruity smoky finish."

1.5,"Undiluted
Nosing: hit hard on the start with sharp, peppery, peat, barbecue - midway and it quickly open up to tinge of fruitiness, vanilla, caramel is strong too. All through a burning alcohol through your tracts 
 
Palate: Light initially - followed by a hit of spiciness, iodine, medicinal and oiliness. Smokiness is light. Flavour is a lot stronger than the likes of four oaks 

Finish: After-taste has typical Laphroaig smoke. But the brininess lingers in your mouth 

References: 
Compared to Four oaks, I would say this, personally, loses in comparison. The peatiness is tamed and light which I adore about Laphroaig; but this offers a fruitier burst of flavour that you do not get with four oaks. I would prefer triple wood instead or lore for a more rounded flavour. The latter would be my choice though."

4.0,"Less of the standard Laphroaig TCP medicinal taste than normal, but it’s definitely still there.  The upfront taste is that PX sherry bolstered with a full bodied smokiness.  It’s sweetness is well balanced with smoke, chilli and salt making it a well rounded dram.  The finish is sweet and smoke that lingers beautifully on the palate.  Another lovely NAS dram from Laphroaig."

4.5,"When you say peat+sherry, you got me hooked. This travel retail exclusive Laphroaig is triple matured and one of those maturations happen in a Pedro Ximenez Cask. I got to say i expected more, but still this is one fine dram.

Bottled at 48%abv, Tawny.

On the nose is just not that powerful. Sherry-sherry= Not that raisin dried fruit lie.
Puffs of smoke. Herbal medicinal note typical from laphroaig. A little cake crest, 
Vanilla cream very thick remembers me of glendronach 12. Oregano and Prunes.

On the palate is an atomic bomb. Amazing. So powerful and full of character. Red fruits, wine, grapes and full smoke barbecue sensation in the palate. Feels like smoking. Ashy. Peppery. Different from other laphroaigs. Sherry presence is felt.

The aftertaste is a wild one. Long and refreshing, there are two aftertastes: the first herbal mouth full and when it ends it lits again like those trick candles from birthday cakes, storing some after-spice behind your teeth.

Overall i think it is a fine interesting dram but a not very balanced one and not very easy to drink due to its power. Nevertheless 92 over 100 is a perfect score for it."
