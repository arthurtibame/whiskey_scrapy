4.5,Light and fruity onset with a bourbon oak finish. Very nice.

4.0,"Nose: Malted grain and stone fruits (peaches, apricots). A faint hint of banana and some white grape juice. There’s a crisp maritime air about it but it’s not a briny malt. A bright and enveloping nose that is on the light side, slightly sweet and full, and very elegant.

Palate: Cereal and fruity arrival, but like the nose it is crisp and dry rather than sweet. Some bright barley sugar notes. Spirit driven and lean – a dry bourbon cask maturation. Some bright, hot spices and an increasingly malty character as it develops.

Finish: Medium, with lingering barley notes and just a touch of oak.

Signatory must have invested in quite a few casks of Clynelish back in the mid 1990s because it’s not difficult to pick up bottlings from them of 16-23 year old Clynelish in both the Unchillfiltered and Cask Strength ranges.

This particular one is a very nice presentation of the distillery’s profile and I enjoyed the all-bourbon cask maturation very much. Clynelish is basically a crisp waxy whisky with lots of subtle sweet and herby things happening in the background, and bourbon maturation really plays to its strengths. This one is a sophisticated and slightly dry whisky that develops nicely in the glass and rewards patient tasting.  A drop of water enhances its background sweetness to good effect.

In comparison to the standard 14 year old distillery bottling (which is very good) this is drier and more elegant, and makes the younger expression seem overly sweet and heavy. It also has a much lighter and more lifted finish. Recommended, if you can find it.

“Very Good” : 4 stars"
