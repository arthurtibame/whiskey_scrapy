4.0,I'm still starting out in the world of scotches (just had my first bottle of Laphroig). That being said I was really happy with how this went down. Smoky but not like inhaling a campfire and one of the smoothest I've had. Definitely worth the money for this one!

3.0,"False advertisement. The labeling and description makes you think it's gonna be SUPER peaty, but it's not. On same level as a bowmore 12 I'd say. It's really thin and watery, not creamy at all. Quite disappointing actually. But for the money I payed $40 cad it's on par with its competitors, so 3/5.

Edit: I'm tasting this back to back with the ARDBEG 10, gotta say one isn't better than the other. Smokehead is more brash while the ARDBEG 10 is more refined. However Smolehead is a lot sweeter than the ARDBEG 10 though"

3.0,"This was my first ever scotch...ever, and I liked it from the start. I should have reviewed this eons ago, but I forgot all about it. It was in a bar, and I decided it was time to try scotch. I ordered a flight that started with Glenmorangie 10, then it when to the Isle of Jura 10, and finished with this... glass. Starting with the Glenmorangie 10, I was happy that it wasn't corn liquor (I hate bourbon), but it wasn't anything interesting to me. The Isle of Jura was a *tad* different, but it was more of the same. When I tried this nectar, something happened. I literally said to myself, ""There is something about this I love, but I have no earthly idea what it is"". Obviously back then, I had no idea what peat or smoke was, or tasted like, but it was the only the beginning. From that day forward, I asked every liquor store if they had a bottle of (esss-lay), which was a pretty sad pronunciation. I've come a long way. I'll be popping a bottle of Bunnahabhain Ceobanech in a day or two."

null,"Trad.Reverso: Smokehead est autant un whisky de classique Islay que la Diligence est un film occidental classique. Le nez est un rossé de tourbe consistante(de viande) - tout le caoutchouc brûlé et des traces de dérapage sur le goudron. Mais ces lourds arômes sont toute la conversation et aucune action. Ils s'effondrent sur eux quand vous prenez une petite gorgée. Le palais - qui est disorientingly crémeux - est un désordre fragile de poivre blanc salin, attrayant et la vanille, qui s'intensifie avec quelques gouttes d'eau. Cette vanille, cependant, est entravée dans à la fin par le lourd de poivre(poivron), la fin(finition) d'algue-y. """

This may not deserve a 5-star, BUT it definitely does not deserve the trash review it has to date!

The scotch is impressive in nose, big time ash tray, and the taste to follow is an Islay oil fire, scorching the shore, as the nearby metal music festival patrons destroy nearby houses and the local rick-house to drink the stuff and add the wooden pieces to the massive shoreline bonfire."

2.5,"Nose: Seaweed, brine and smoke.

Palate: Smoky, fruity and sweet.

Finish: Short, sweet and fruity.

This is not a complex whisky bursting with nuance. It is a very young spirit painted from a limited palette, however what is there is of a high caliber and enjoyable.

The profile is simple rather than elegant, but harsh criticism of this whisky misses the point. It's not trying to be Lagavulin 12 year - it is a very young, crisp and basic peated whisky that would be fantastic as a mixer but can still stand up to neat tasting (well, maybe add a good big hunk of ice).

It is rather like a young Ardbeg but I can't imagine they produce enough spirit to have any spare to sell to bargain level independent bottlers. Most likely its a young Caol Ila, but who knows? What is certain is that the official rating here of 69 is ridiculous. This is a fine, reasonably priced, young workhorse single malt worth at least the same rating as a mid-shelf blend.

Big peat notes and vanilla and caramel assault the nose. Big if not subtle. 
On the palate the peat is much subdued. More pronounced on the palate are the vanilla and caramel with suggestions of fruit and oak.
Despite the stingy curated review by what's her name, I like it a lot. ☺"

null,"Aug 8, 2019 at Darby's Gastown in Vancouver. Color is medium amber.  Obviously smoky, somewhat briny on the nose, but complexity is thin, as in lacking. Alcohol burn up front, and some of the promise of the nose, but again a bit thin. Very palatable, but eminently forgettable. Not the most memorable whiskey ever, but not to be disdained altogether. On a scale of 1 to 100 I'd give this about 60. All she wrote.."

2.25,Heavy smoke on the nose. But not much on the palate. Thin. Meh.
3.5,"It has a very full nose with lots of peat smoke and some briney notes as well. The smoke and brine translate well on the palate with a surprisingly smooth mouth feel. I tried a bit of the Ardbeg An Oa shortly after and found that the Smoke Head is actually a bit smokier than the Ardbeg although not as refined. It does appear that the Smoke Head my have some colour added as it is quite a bit darker than the Ardbeg but it is a very good budget priced Islay noetheless. To my taste it seems a little more similar to Laphroaig than Ardbeg but I quickly admit that I do not have the most refined palate for picking out those subtle nuances and did not have any Laphraoig on hand to really compare. To sum it all up, if you are a fan of smoke and don’t want to break the bank on filling that void Smoke head is a good buy. It is leaps and bounds ahead of Islay Mist and Mclelland’s Islay even if it doesn’t have some of the class of the primary Islay producers."
