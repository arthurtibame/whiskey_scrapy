4.5,"This four grain bourbon is dark copper in color with thin oily legs.

The nose is full-bodied and sweet overall, with notes of sour candy, overripe peach, apple skins, sweet floral honey, melted caramel, milk chocolate, leather, and sourdough bread.

There’s an oily mouthfeel on the palate, and after the initial heat there arise notes of cherry, strawberry candy, dry oak and grassy straw, dark chocolate, vanilla, and BBQ char,

The finish is long, lingering and spicy like curry with dry oak tannins.

I am sipping from one of the bottles of batch #3 of this special release bourbon from 291, and man, it is so good! With the addition of wheat into the mix, the already complex flavor is both broadened and softened, making for a fantastic dram!
Try it if you have the chance! Cheers!"

4.5,Very hot. Tastes all of 120 proof. Hides some real nice oak and spice once the jet fuel vapor blows off. Love the Aspen sweetness.
