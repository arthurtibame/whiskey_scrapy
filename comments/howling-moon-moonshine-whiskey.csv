5.0,"This is easily one of my favorite bottles in my collection. The deep dark molasses hue to this whiskey is gorgeous. The first thing that comes to mind when tasting this is delicious smoked meat, what could possibly make it more North Carolinian than that? Deep, rich bourbon flavors also come into play, all achieving a really excellent balance. Well worth trying, especially for how affordable it is."
