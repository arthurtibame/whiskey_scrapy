4.0,"I really like this one for the days where I just want a nice whiskey to sip on. 

On the nose I get a ton of honey and butter biscuits (shortbread), cinnamon and vanilla. Most of that follows to the taste, mixed with raisins, sweet apples, pears, vanilla custard and buttery goodness. 

Slight, pleasent burn and long aftertaste of buttered biscuits with honey. Not a whiskey for peatheads, but perfect to sip while reading a good book or enjoying a movie."

3.0,day 8 - super mild
2.0,"Day 7, 2017 advent. Sort of plain vanilla Irish whisky. Not bad in anyway, just not especially good either. Not bad, but not worth having a full bottle on hand either.  It was remarkably smooth, and easy to drink. Fruity, and well rounded. Recommend it neat at room temperature. Again, not bad, just too many others that are better."
2.0,Completely fine everyday whiskey.  Nothing too interesting though
2.0,"Smooth and velvety, but a bit boring. Lacks complexity. A bit of candied pear, kind of like a Williams pear Schnaps. Not much else."

3.0,"I picked up the vanilla and a little bit of the cinnamon roll, but I was not able to pick up the pear in this whiskey. If I were to have an every day drinker I would prefer Writers Tears over this. Far smoother as an Irish whiskey, Writers Tears is superior to Roe &   Company and more than likely at a lower price point. This wasn’t bad, but not great either."

4.0,"Very smooth, with just a touch of an alcohol smell on the nose. Definitely can taste the vanilla coming through. As others have said, its smooth and everyday drinkable, but kind of a one note whiskey. Pleasantly surprised though."
