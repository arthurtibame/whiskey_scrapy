1.75,I really wanted to like this but it is not good. I've tried it 5 times now and every time it tastes very medicine or ethanol tasting .

0.5,"The story and the bottle is the best thing about this “bourbon”. Don’t waste your time or money, total disappointment. I have a very pretty paper weight now... tried it neat, a drop of water, more water and on the rocks. Nothing made this cheaply produced whiskey taste better or even like bourbon. To give you a reference I’ve enjoyed and own 100s of different scotch and bourbons, never have I been so disappointed."
