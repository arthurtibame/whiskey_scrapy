3.5,"One of my favorite non-Scottish distilleries is from Sweden ( Smogen), so I figured why not give a try to another Swede.  This one is a blend of casks from 8 to 13yr of age, finished first in oloroso and PX sherry cask, and then cask that previously held cloudberry wine.  Cloudberries look like orange blackberries, but grow in boreal forest and arctic tundra.  I’ve had some in Norway ages ago, and thought it was delicious—a cross between raspberry and currents, almost sweet-tart.  

The nose on this is amazing.  Like smelling strawberry cream.  Nose alone is a 5 out of 5 stars.  The palette...a bit strange.  Bitter, salty, a hint of smoke.  

Interesting to try, but glad I had only a 3cl pour, and not a full bottle."
4.0,"Lovely, sweet, strawberry milkshake, salt"
2.75,"Summerton Virtual Whisky Festival sample.

This is unlike most Scotch and has its own character.

Upfront, it’s quite vegetal, with some damp, green notes.  It develops into sweet oak, vanilla and some dried fruit.  It has a long, slightly spicy finish that sours as it fades.

It tastes quite young (although they say it contains 8-30y/o spirits) and has some funky, mushroomy, salty back notes.

It’s unusual in character.  I’m not sure it’s one for me, but I’ll need to try a few more times before I decide."
3.0,Un familiar with this whiskey as well as it being partly matured in casks that previously held cloudberry wine?? Might be my lack of familiarity as it does not hit any high notes for me nor does not it hit any low notes. I am indifferent to it. The nose definitely lacks what I look forward to. The palate & finish good enough
1.5,Sort of toffee/toast on the nose. Odd flavor across the pallet. Not one I love.
