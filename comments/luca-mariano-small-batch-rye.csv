4.25,"Slightly sweeter than most ryes with a solid spice profile. Really enjoyable and a great way to introduce your fiends to rye if they’re into sweeter bourbons. 

Nose - honey, rye spice, almonds,  it grass, and hints of butterscotch 
Taste - a bit of honey sweetness at first and then a healthy dose of rye spices and herbal notes
Finish - floral and spicy notes linger pleasantly, significant burn going down"

4.0,Always feel special being the first to review a dram. This is a new Distillery owned by a Michigander that got the whiskey bug. Nose is mellow and comes off of fresh baked rye bread. As you take the first sip it immediately is apparent this isn't a typical rye. Hints of honey and almond come through that you would normally associate with straight bourbon. A more reserved pepper finish follows with a mild bite. Very nice if not different that other ryes on the market.
