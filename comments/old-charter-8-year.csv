5.0,Good cheap everyday bourbon.
null,Did we really need a new review of a discontinued product?
3.0,$17 for a 1.75. Almost Buffalo Trace is pretty dang good for the price as a mixer. Drinkable old fashioned right now on the patio made with it.

3.0,"Reviewing a 25+ year old 1L bottle that was in my dad's liquor cabinet. Deep rich color, alcohol and burnt sugar aroma. Thin mouthfeel and a solid burn. A few lingering hints of caramel on the finish, but definitely was the same quality then as it is now."

2.0,"Old Charter has recently lost its age statement (it's now ""Old Charter No. 8""), and this is a review of the non-age stated version. Old Charter is based on the Buffalo Trace #1 (low rye) mashbill, and tastes like what it is: a low-cost bourbon pulled from the barrels that didn't make the cut for standard Buffalo Trace. Flavours are sour, sour cherry, nail polish remover, pecan, green apple, Sharpie. Soggy wood, basement. Caramel (caramel syrup), vanilla. Hot on the mouth, chalky, waves of sweet and dry. Crab apples, faint apple pie. Pine wood. Very ""meh""."
2.0,sweet watery varnish turpentine dandelion (For the #8 not the 8 yr aged version)

2.0,Dropped age statement in Jan 2014. Weird artificial sweetness. Difference between 8 year and NAS is pretty stark; this wasn't anything to write home about at 8 years and the added youth is doing it no favors.

null,This really needs to be broken into 2 sections.  1 for age stated and 1 for the #8.  Tried them back to back and they are totally different animals.

Just aged 2 years less."

3.25,It’s a great whiskey for $18. I’m able to drink it neat and enjoy it.

4.0,"Given an 18 price point it’s really a good value. I wish it had a little bit higher alcohol proof as it would really be a great bourbon. 

The nose is banana and the palate is more oak. It’s very thin and exits rather quickly but for $18 it’s pretty good."

2.5,"This is no longer 8 years old, it is now “No. 8.” Even still, it is a solid pour, especially because of the price. However, there is nothing particularly special about it to make it stand out. I’d spend a few more bucks and buy Buffalo Trace."

3.0,"I’ve been seeing this forever, and it being a Buffalo Trace mashbill #1 bourbon, I thought I’d see what a $16.99 bottle variant of it tastes like.

The nose has fresh banana, vanilla and light caramel.

The palate has a fairly thin mouthfeel, but slightly oily at the same it. There’s banana, vanilla and light and I mean extremely light oak.

The finish is short. To be expected from an 80 proofer. I get a little bit of baking spices here for a second.

I mean It’s fine. Nothing harsh about it, which is a victory when trying anything in this price range.
 It tastes somewhat watered down, so the higher proof version is probably more full. Someone very new to bourbon would probably call this “smooth”."
3.5,Easy drinker. Medium spice.
3.5,"Nose- A hint of astringency, sugar cookie, and a little lemon. 
Body- A good pour for the price. Sweet lemon sugar cookies continues. There is some bitterness in the back end.
Finish- Short and light. Some notes of fresh grass and lemon peel."
