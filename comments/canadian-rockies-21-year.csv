4.5,"Bought this after the rum howler write up where he rates it as ambrosia of the God’s :) And it is pretty damn good ! 
Look & Story 1/ 1 
love the 21 year and the made for Taiwan before coming here story! Bottle is a little lacklustre though not really any different than the basic centennial
Nose: 1 / 1 caramel maple vanilla delicious 
Taste:
1.75 / 2 excellent mouth feel caramel hit not really getting that Canadian spicey note this is subtle lots of subtle flavours hard to peg like the challenge oaky sweet! And caramels more sweet spice would have got it perfect for my palate
Finish and burn: .75 / 1 
This does have a burn in the aftertaste I like it but know it would turn others off sweetness lingers and subtle sweet corn ends
Total: 4.25 I liked 35 yr wisers better as it is more complex as it should be but at $75 ish I can get like 3 bottle of this tough call :) Answer is get both and save the Wosers 35 only for people who think this is a 4+ this is a litmus test for excellent Canadian whiskey and it is at a reasonable price !"
null,"Canadian Rockies 21                   
Irish Heather in Vancouver 
October 31st 2018
Served in a tasting glass. 
                
Not a lot of color 
Sweet honey and caramel on the nose.
Maybe a trace of smoke on the nose. Not a lot though.
Vanilla and oak and spice.
A bit fruity.
Follows through on the palate. 
This is a refined whiskey. 
Would I put down a hundred for a bottle?  Not today no."
