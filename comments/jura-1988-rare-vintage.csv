Tasting Note by The Chaps at Master of Malt

Nose: Jammy dark fruits and earthy malt, with a good whack of thyme honey.
Palate: Still packed full of raspberry and strawberry, though now with roasted coffee beans to help balance and give it a subtle smokiness.
Finish: Mature oak warmth, bolstered by black pepper and stewed berries"
