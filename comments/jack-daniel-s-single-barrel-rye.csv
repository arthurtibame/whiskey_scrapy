4.0,"Surprisingly fruity nose has banana, cranberry, and toasted almond. The palate is absolutely stunning with balance and grace as notes of clove, candied almonds, pistachio, baking spice, peanut shells and ground coffee work in harmony. The finish has good length and resolves with a spicy sweet mix of cinnamon, dried fruits, banana and burt sugar. An ice cube really tames the rugged notes here and focuses more on the sweet and spicy. For me, a must."

Palette: the sweetness of the sugar maple charcoal and the spiciness of the rye are quite apparent and really blend together well like gingerbread at Christmas; earthy w/ hints of leather; a bit hot neat. Finish: long and spicy w/ hints of nuts and vanilla.  A winner in my book."

3.0,"Barrel #16-1353 (bottled 2-24-16). Colour on this guy is a surprising almost-wine-finished ruby/chestnut, although holding it up to the light reveals the colour to have a certain thin-ness to it. Initial smell (Distiller's notes ain't lying) IS seriously a pretty intense banana candy (Runts is the brand-name; if you've never had them, the other analogue might be that banana-flavoured medicine, Amoxicillin). Maple syrup. Fuzzy marker, slightly metallic. Creamed corn. Sweet mint and herbal notes, some floral character, and--way distant--are the bakery/deli smells I usually associate with rye (clove, dill, caraway, baking bread). Smoky BBQ sauce. Taste offers an initial soft sweetness, then the heat grows. But there are some interesting things going on here--think regular JD on steroids, but with a distinct sense of the grain: maple syrup, more banana, custard, bitter fruits (cranberry?), deli spices. As with most JD products, the weakness is in the finish, which leans a bit soggy, metallic, and faintly bile-ish--but less egregiously so than many of its siblings, I must say. All told, it's not bad. It's definitely a member of the JD family (the sugar maple, the banana-flavour, some corn sweetness), it's definitely a bit overpriced, and it could definitely use another year or so for the flavours to integrate more fully. All told, though, it's STILL my favourite entry in the Jack Daniel's line-up."

4.0,"Perfumed nose that smells like cherry gummies.  Given the charred barrel nature I'm also assuming some brown sugar as well.  The palate is sweet and sticky with plenty of rye spice character and banana.  If there is any vanilla in there, its barely noticeable.  Moderate length finish that leaves behind cherry licorice residue.  Though I have a tree nut allergy, and don't have the pleasure of such flavors and textures, I get some nutty notes as well.  Very pleasant stuff, and a nice change of pace from my usual glass of scotch."

Nose: ripe fruit and vanilla sweetness show up first, followed by hints of spice and toasted oakiness. 

Palate: fruity sweetness and vanilla at the front. Oak and spiciness joining in the middle. Heats up towards the end. Finish is relatively dry and quick with lingering spices enticing the palate. 

I’d give this a 3.4/5 so 3 on here. Good but not mind blowing. Definitely an enjoyable dram nonetheless!"

94 proof, Barrel No. 16-7698, bottled 11/29/16
2/11/18
Time to conquer my fear of J.D.! Figured it was now or never, and ""single barrel"" and ""rye"" are just the triggers to convince me to take the plunge, despite the omens of banana runts and my total dislike of Old No. 7 and Gentleman's.
A:
Caramel dark copper with beady lacing that forms droplets, the larger of which descend to form legs.
N:
Very sour morello cherry atop a hint of sun-ripened banana peel. 
Sharp and sour, though not harsh, just very forward. That morello cherry jumps out of the glass.
There a bit of caramel creme candy at the tail end if you're looking for it.
Grassy or minty notes are nowhere, though there may just be the slightest of a star anise note hiding beneath the dominant cherry pie.
T:
Spicy lavender and sandalwood, fresh plums, lilac, honeysuckle, and cayenne pepper with a Bubble-Yum bugglegum tail end...
Yes, at first, this presents like the infamous banana runts candy.
However, dissecting the profile reveals some really special fresh floral flavors that are pretty exciting.
The sweetness is like the nectar of honeysuckle and the bitterness balances it just like chewing the petals of a violet.
All of the spice is like a ripe chili pepper, a capsacin spiciness and not a phenolic one, with plenty of berry fruitiness along for the ride.
The texture does have some oiliness, but like a peanut oil, and it dances in a lively way, pricking your tongue all over as it taps its shoes.
F:
There's a resiny, waxiness that lightly adheres to the tongue all down the center of the tongue from fromt to back, with light warmth in the sides of the mouth.
It finshes like a candy, but like a Twizzler, waxy and cherry. Then comes the barrel, and it's like we have just licked the inside stave of a toasty one, freshly dumped.
O:
This is a really fun drink. The sweetness is a unique fruity-floral one rather than your standard vanilla and caramel, corn, and maybe honey.
Despite banana runts being an adequate descriptor, I do not think this tastes artificial or sugary.

OK, you've convinced me. I'm no longer afraid of J.D."

4.0,"I cut my whiskey teeth on Jack's ""Old No. 7""; it was the first whiskey I actually liked. Didn't drink much of it straight other than in shots (or occasionally on the rocks), but it was a go-to when I wanted something other than beer. Haven't had any Jack for some time now but it still has a special place in my heart and memory. But on to the review!

This whiskey comes in a beautiful square bottle, with a nice cork stopper. The barrel info is on the collar of the bottle neck. This bottle is from Rick L-2, Barrel No. 17-0225, bottled on 1/9/17. There is no age statement. Bottled at 47% ABV, the whiskey is a gorgeous dark maghogany amber in the glass. The mash bill for this dram is 70/18/12, rye/corn/malted barley. It leaves a nice oily coating and produces long slow legs when swirled. So far so good!

The nose is spicy cinnamon and cloves. Some corn sweetness and oak. Dark pumpernickel/rye bread, burnt butter and caramel. Completely different from the Old No. 7 I remember, but then this is a rye, not a ""Tennessee"" bourbon. There is very little burn considering the proof. Very nice.

The first sip is a little hot with a strong rye character. Dry and oaky. This is not the ""spicy rye"" that you get with most so-called rye whiskeys that are barely 51% rye and a bunch of corn. This is pungent, dark rye. After the palate and the glass settle down, there is some sweetness with a buttery charcoal note. Deep down inside there are hints of the Old No. 7. There is definitely a familial relation, but more like a 2nd cousin than a brother or sister.

The finish is fairly long with more warm rye and oak. This dram has more in common with Dad's Hat Pennsylvania Rye than any bourbon or ""barely rye"" whiskey out there. Dad's Hat has no corn at all. As a result it's almost too much rye, too dry. The 18% corn in this mashbill adds just enough sweetness to balance the rye very nicely. There is a bold rye punch, but tempered with just enough sweetness to make it more enjoyable. This is a very enjoyable whiskey. I picked up this bottle for $45 at my local Kroger's liquor store, which makes it very accessable and reasonable in my opinion. I have no problem giving this 4.5/5.0. Highly recommended. Cheers!"

  I find many ryes to be one dimensional;, I find myself buying and trying them over and over only  to discover that many taste disappointingly similar, the spices and body are very similar- this bottle is not exactly an exception to my feelings; however, there is a smoothness and complexity to this bottle that has merit. 
  The palette is sugary invoked me to think about it a bit more, there’s a floral theme here that isn’t overpowering, but isn’t great - better than many high end whistle pigs. Oink"

Hands down, this is the best Jack product I've ever had. A premium bottle that any rye lover would be lucky to have on hand. Smooth and complex, spicy but not pepper and easy on the taste buds. I thought it was a bit saltier than the reviews and the vanilla came out very prevalent. Two of us drank half the bottle before we went out for the night. Hopefully that's my only hangover of 2018."

3.0,"I tried the regular rye and was impressed by it for the price. So naturally I wanted to try the single Barrel to see if it was much better. In short, while it's better, it's not worth the premium. It's a little hot for the proof and honestly, if tasted blind, I don't know that I would pick this over the regular offering.
The pallette is spicy with oak and some vanilla present. Finish is medium and oak driven. There is a bit of a bite too. 3/5. Ok but not great."

It has a spicy palate, lots of cinnamon and black pepper. The finish is long, spicy, bitter, some salted caramel shows up. Wow, great single barrel rye from JD. If you would have me taste this blind I would never guess its from them. Definitely recommend this to rye lovers!"
5.0,The straight Rye edition has been perfected in the Tennessee Brand's Single Select Edition. This entry elevates the pallete and nose to a spicier dimension without drowning out the fruity and charactistic vanilla notes. A slightly higher ABV adds greater complexity to the finish with the oak lingering with the spice for an unforgettable experience.

4.5,"Poured neat, its everything the reg JD rye is but cranked up and FAR better. Nose is succulent banana bread, doughy maple rye with baking spice and rich sweet barrel notes. Has a gourmet circus peanuts vibe if there is such a thing. Palate continues the theme with juicy fruit gum, baked maple pastry with rye bread dough, candied nuts, baking spice and just general yumminess( the whole exceeds the sum of its parts). Finish is looong and fulfilling banana char, cinnamon and yeasty ryedough with allspice and sweet wood . I cant imagine how good a barrel proof of this juice would be. JD can get it done when they want to, the Single Barrel Barrel proof and this are MONSTERS.........Top shelf elite rye in class with Pikesville(need to run side by side)......96/100.......buy it you will be very pleased"

4.25,"As someone who usually sticks to Single Malt Scotch, I have to say that I am very pleased with this rye. It has the typical Jack vanilla notes but it is a lot more grown up than an Old No.7 or even a Gentlemen Jack. It's a rye, not a bourbon and a good one at that. 
Remembering those cheap Jim Beams and Jacks I had in the past was the reason I stayed away from American Whiskey for so long. The Single Barrel Rye changed that. It even is on my top shelf now, which is surprising for a Scotch guy."
4.0,"Floral and fruity nose, with sweet cereal. Spicy rye up front in the mouth, then sweet grass and big vanilla, and charred oak. Finish is moderate, with charred oak and spicy astringent nettles. Medium body, light mouthfeel. Beautiful auburn color and handsome bottle/packaging. Easy sipping rye, opens up with some ice/water. Has grown on me over time. Proof that JD is not a one trick pony, and can produce a quality premium produce."

4.0,"So, the knock on this is that it smells and tastes like banana Runts candy. Legit critique or JD hate? Let us find out...

On the nose, yes...it's there. Banana Runts. But it's not all that's there. Black cherry, spice cake, maple, and barrel char. So yeah not traditional for a rye, but inviting nonetheless. 

Palate hits you with (yes) banana, caramel and peanut before switching to a spice bloom of cinnamon and black pepper. Spice carries in the finish for a long time, and with a decent Kentuck...errr...Tennessee hug.  There's a ""musty peanut"" (is that a thing?) note way back there at the end of the finish that is funky and enjoyably unique. 

Drinks a little hotter than it's proof would indicate. Mouthfeel is medium.

Truth? This is closer to ""JD made an awesome bourbon"" than ""JD made an awesome rye"", but as you can guess by that comment I liked this a lot. Definitely the best product I ever had from Jack Daniel's by a large margin, and I bet most would have a hard time guessing it was from JD in a blind testing. 

Side note: I like the way JD does the pricing on their 375ml bottles, which is only a buck or two higher than half of a 750ml. So, would I buy this again at $25 for a 375ml? Yes...yes I would."

Whiskey.   70% rye, 18% corn and 12% malt  @ 47 abv,, turns out to be the secret setting, clearly you found the sweet spot.   The nose gives me a distinct bourbon feel due to the extra sweetness and yet still says ""rye"".  A solid warm cinnamon bread and honey are apparent.

This rye has an incredible smoothness on the tongue with a sweet round profile and soft approach, a pleasing mouthful,  it's like finding Jane Russell in a soft black velvet bath robe sitting on your bed.  With that, ""you want me, you know you want me, and you know there's not a DAMN THING you can do about it"" look on her face. 

This is going to the Top Shelf Rye list for me, also not coincidentally my top JD product, so sorry it took me this long to get around to trying it, but occasionally good things do come to those who wait.   Lynchburg has finally done it."
