3.75,"As it is opening, the stout finish becomes more apparent.  Balanced nose.  Although finished for only 3 months, the stout seems to overtake the Bourbon.  Something seems off and out of balance on the finish.  This sits on shelves for a reason; it's not balanced, and overpriced!  The distillery is unknown, but believe it to be in KY.  My score was 79"
