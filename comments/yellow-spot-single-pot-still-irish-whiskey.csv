4.5,"A beautifully clean nose of honey apples orange blossom and linden. On the palate the honeyed sweetness is accented by the clove and vanilla spice. 
The finish is equally clean and draws out the apple citrus to its full extent. 
This whisky is incredibly simple and yet so well balanced and clean that I can’t help but applaud it!"

4.0,"Well what a treat.

I've enjoyed a few bottles of Green Spot and took advantage of a price offer to delve into this.

A classic Irish slurp but with subtlety and layers of flavour. Very drinkable but this deserves thought and attention to understand and get the most out of it.

On the nose... Some alcohol to add punch to soft fruit flavours (especially apple) and the sherry influence. This is the odd bit. I got a hint of ripe corn but to me it's tinned sweet corn. Open a tin. Sniff. Yep. Tinned sweet corn. Fascinating.

Taste... Vanilla definitely. Peach or a sweet soft fruit anyway. A spice nibble. These are regulation flavours but they are distinct and definite. They are not hiding. They persist.

After... An acceptable burn to counterbalance the sweet fruit and cask flavours.

Yellow Spot is no coward but it wants you to love it not conquer you. It is warm and friendly. Give it a home. You'll be glad you did."

3.0,"This whisky has a wonderfully fruity nose.  I really didn't want to proceed to sip because I was enjoying the  nasal experience.  I get candied pears.  In the mouth the whisky is lighter and with a more delicate taste  than I expected . To be honest, the flavour was good (fruity again), but not as full as I was expecting - a bit of a letdown for me after that wonderful smell.  To be honest I haven't made my mind up on this whisky.  I like it, but is it workth $100 Cdn?  I think it's going to take a couple more tastings for me to make that conclusion."

5.0,"One of my favorite Irish whiskies. It is rich, layered, and smooth. The nose carries candy shop aromas with a whiff of chocolate. The taste is initially light and fruity, then it evolves to reveal a complex mixture of Christmas pudding, toffee, and roasted nuts  the finish is complex with sweet toffee notes. Bought in the UK; glad to see that is now available in the US!"

4.0,"A nice busy nose of oak, milk chocolate and malt (like Whoppers), banana and honey.   When the dram arrives on on the palate, the same flavors that are on the nose come in form in a full body.   A dry, oaky finish with black pepper spice that fades quickly leaving the mouth with oak and a small hint of mint that is relatively short.  The addition of water adds more chocolate malt to the nose and sweetens the palate of honey.  However, the body is much thinner even with the slightest hydration.  A complex dram much different than most other Irish Whiskeys that I have tasted.  Only gets better as it opens. For the price, other options like it's brethren Green Spot or Redbreast may a better alternative.  [$90][91/100] [Opened: 3/17/15][10/11/15]."

3.0,"I'm not a huge fan of Irish whiskey...I didn't really like the much lauded Redbreast 12, so maybe it's just my palette that prefers its cousins over to other side of the North Channel.   But...I do like this over  the sibling Green Spot and definately over the Redbreast or Teelings.   I can look at its color all day. A beautiful autumn-y bronze.  Nose---papayas and mango.  Exotic tropical fruits.  Taste is sweet.  But sweet is relative.  Not as sweet as the sugar coated Kraken rum I had, but definatley sweet for a whiskey.  Without water, I just felt the Amrut burn.  I need a bit of water to soften it.   If you like Irish whiskey, this is a must-have.  If you're like me and prefer the Scottish cousins, save the $100 on a good bottle of Lagavulin or Laphroaig."

There is a considerable amount of oak and sweet fruits on the palate, and that familiar creamy vanilla that you normally encounter in Irish whiskey.  Considering the price and the excessive spice, I think I'll be sticking with my Green Spot for my personal collection.  I wouldn't mind it as a gift though!"

3.0,"My senses are confounded on this one. Pronounced unripe banana and some cream soda vanilla (the unmalted barely signature of traditional Irish Pot-Still whiskey, not always to my liking). Light tart nectarine, bourbon oak spices. Hints of maple syrup lurk beneath. Intense palate, sweet, something wine-like, but not exactly sherry sweet (could this be the Malaga casks?). Warming and even sweeter with added water. Huge finish, bourbon-like cinnamon with malt and rich wood that lingers. Good when the mood strikes, but I can't say it's better than the much more available and affordable Green Spot, to my memory. I'm afraid my palate is becoming too narrow to properly appreciate single pot-still Irish unmalted barely components... my brain goes on green-banana / bourbon-alert...Dry glass: ""please pass the soda bread and honey, dearie."

Beautiful viscosity and a taste  that keeps me swirling the whiskey around and around my mouth before I swallow.The three barrels really each stand out but also blend nicely. You really get the balance between the vanilla of the bourbon, Sherry and the honey sweetness of the malaga. Really love the spice of the black pepper that comes through as well. It does tend to be at the upper limit of what I can bare sweetness wise though. Almost a dessert whiskey. A whisky that after a year open with only a few shots left still tastes great"

4.0,"Yellow Spot.  So much legend surrounds you.  And finally, we meet.  And I find myself conflicted.  

Don't get me wrong.  You're gorgeous.   An amber angel in a glass greeting me with sweet aromas of maple, honey, a hint of spice.   You're a cuddle in a blanket kind of warm.  

And your taste?   A soft, sweet and lingering experience akin to a first kiss... complete with the same initial heat of that first touch.   Smooth and sweet - a great whisky.   The best Irish whiskey I've had so far.  

The conflict?   To be blunt, Yellow Spot, it's your price point.  You're 12 years old.  And in my mind, the Scots have set my expectations of price point for 12 year olds somewhere about $40 cheaper.   I admit - it's not fair.  Because you really are amazing.  But my wandering eye can't help but think about what I can get in a scotch at your price point.  

I know, I know - you're not like them and it's not fair to compare you like that.  But, for $90, I'm looking longingly at the Springbank 15 and the Oban 14 sitting there at a lower price with just as much, albeit different, flavor, and can't help but feel like you're overpriced.  

There. I said it.  I'm not proud of it.  But it's out there.  I think you're about $30 too high.  

Which should mean I'm walking away from you.   A stolen kiss and warm memories ahead of the game.   But, I'll be damned if there's not something about you that makes me think you are worth it.  

So clearly I'm confused.  

And what surer sign could there be that I just might be falling in love?"

One thing is for sure, the nose of this immediately reveals a lot more body and substance. The tones are rich and enduring. The color is beautifully crafted from the aging process and all of those things play crucial parts in making this option better in every way.

As a generalization, I find that Irish whiskey is less bold then other varieties and this usually hinders me from pursuing them. However, this dram provides more in all areas, most importantly, a fuller mouth feel and lingering flavor profile. You'll find deeper caramel, vanilla and a much bolder and more vibrant wood and heat. These all played their parts with laser precision. 

Yellow Spot's main issue is one of limitation. Once you enjoy the craftsmanship of those elements, you're done. There just isn't much to experience and that forces one to ponder whether the cost is justified. (FWF $10 Dram [3rd] share #31)"

Here in Ontario corrected for the 50ml bottle difference Yellow Spot is only $8 more and so this seems a no brainer to me. $99.85

4.25,"Have to say I seem to enjoy the Green Spot more and consider it a better value. While the Yellow is presumed to be a more finished work and is truly a very fine whiskey, I actually get more from the Green Spot as an overall experience. The Yellow indeed has perhaps a more polished and longer finish, benefiting from both the Oloroso and Malaga casking. There's no denying the greater complexity. And with the higher proof, it does actually improve in some respects with a touch of water, revealing more than what I taste drinking it neat. But for me the Green still dazzles in it's own way straight from the bottle and for some unknown reason I taste more peaches and cream from it than with the Yellow, despite the lack of the Malaga cask aging. A very pleasant (and economical) conundrum. Glad I tried it and would certainly buy it again. But with the Green I can save the extra $30-35 and enjoy life. As always, your mileage may vary.

1.0,"I wanted to love this, I really did.  Green Spot was the first whiskey I ever had that made me go, “damn, that’s good.”  So, I set out on a search to find Yellow Spot believing it would lead me even closer to whiskey enlightenment.

When I finally got the chance to try a dram I was disgusted.  It was sweet and syrupy in an altogether unpleasant fashion for my tastes.  Whereas Green Spot seemed varied, Yellow Spot seemed to only hit one note and hit it hard.

Now my tastes have definitely shifted from the first taste of Green Spot, so maybe if I had had Yellow all those years ago it would have made a better impression."

5.0,Very good. Low on smoke flavor. Open it up with a few drops of water or drop in a large rock.
4.5,"This is the recreation of an old brand that once was partnered by Red Spot, Green Spot and Blue Spot whiskeys. All bar Blue Spot have been re-released. The pot still content in Yellow Spot is medium weight, similar to Green Spot but aged for at least 12 years. It is drawn from three types of casks. Ex-bourbon and sherry casks are supplemented by some Malaga casks that previously held Pedro Ximenez wine. These PX casks add a good bit of weight, body and flavour, giving an extra dimension to the whiskey. Yellow Spot still retains some of the signature freshness that Green Spot has but offers a definite step up in quality and complexity.

Nose - Aromas of mown hay, cracked black pepper, nutmeg, clove oil and green tea. Sweet honey and peaches from the Malaga casks
Taste - Lots of body and hints of tropical fruits. Pot still spices, honey and red apple combine with flavours of creme brule, fresh coffee and toasted oak.

3.75,"There is a pronounced bright fruity quality on the nose, berries and tart pomegranate. The flavor is sweet and rich. Complicated...I get flowers, honey, cola (oddly), and mineral water. The finish is dry, woodier than most Irish, and long. It is much more complex than most Irish drams. Is it transcendent. No, probably not worth the high price, but a very good pour."
4.0,"Nose: Buttery and grassy-cereal with orange peel, peach, apricot, nectarine, banana and plum against a subtle oak background. As it rests in the glass and opens, a lovely soft vanilla aroma emerges tinged with a hint of sherried-coconut.

Palate: A full and clean, crisp arrival with cereal sweetness. It develops into a warming, faintly spicy palate which has some sour green apple and walnut flavours on the side and a flash of black pepper. It pulls a fast one on you because just when you think it has moved into the finish it surges again with very rounded dark fruity flavours and a touch of sweet fortified wine. The texture is excellent.

Finish: Long. The rich winey cask presence lingers along with the fruity flavours. The aftertaste is sweet gristy cereal.

I have to come clean and admit that I'm not a great fan of Irish whiskey. The lauded soft and approachable character leaves me a bit flat, and the presence of unmalted barley in the ferment gets to smell and taste a bit ""green"" after a while.

At least that's the issue I have with the bottom and mid-shelf Irish that I've tried up until now. Today, however, I've set aside some time to get to know 3 of the more expensive expressions, starting with Midleton's Yellow Spot.

This is an altogether more mature and complex whiskey to those I've had previously, and in no small part that's because it has a character closer to scotch whisky. It's reminiscent of Redbreast 12, but in the same way that Glenfarclas 15 is reminiscent of Glenfarclas 8 - more polish, maturity, depth, finish etc.

It's a beautifully balanced whiskey that is best neat, where its balance and  complexity can be best enjoyed.  A dash of water softens the profile and makes it more approachable but some of its strength of character is lost in the process.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

4.0,"I finally got to taste this one while out in CLT for business. I have to say my initial impression where while it was an upgrade on the Green Spot, it didn't seem to be significant. Sure it was smoother and richer and doesn't have the spice bite of the Green Spot. Then I had a Redbreast 12 after after and the Redbreast tasted watered down in comparison. Gone was the rich, sweet deep profile I expect with the Redbreast. This then was a testament to how good the Yellow Spot was and also the value in comparison behind it. As for my notes, upon entry I got red and orchard fruits with an orange zest. Mid pallette adds bananas and toffee with a long fruits and toasted oak driven finish. Well balanced and lovely mouthfeel.
It's a proper dram for sure, I am just unsure it's worth 2x as much as the Green Spot. Cheers all!"

Non-chill filtered

Nose: deep and evolving in the glass. Vanilla; nutmeg; honey; classic bready note from unmalted barley; slight floral; bright, juicy fruit notes in the background, like melon and green apple. 

Taste: gentle, full and mouth-costing arrival. As it develops, complexities appears as it slowly dries with vanilla, subtle nutmeg and other baking spice notes; vanilla; warm toffee; hint of cocoa; nuttiness like walnut and/or almond; fruitiness like lemon, banana and a hint of pineapple accent the full body. 

Finish: medium-long and complex! Your left with a nice balance of sweet orange and powdered sugar, sour from tart apple and warm, nutty spice with a slight bite.

Value: this is a pricy one, at $80-95 USD. If you’re a bit seasoned in Irish whiskies id say buy with confidence, otherwise try Green Spot first at around $55.

Final thoughts: a journey in subtle complexity, Yellow Spot 12 year is the kind of dram that beguiles the senses. While other notable single pot still Irish whiskies like Redbreast are more forward with you, this one is a bit shy but worth the time investment. It’s straight up delicious but also treats you to something new almost every pour. Give this one a few minutes to breath in the glass before sipping and you’ll fully appreciate this whiskey.

 Score: 4.5/5. Highly recommend buying a bottle.

2.75,"A sample gifted from the ""Whiskey Transfer Program"" from dthom. 

Nose: The usual dried fruits like figs that come from a sherry cask finish with light sugars and a little bit of wood and wine.  The number one smell?  Lemon peel.

Flavor: Sweeter than I would have liked with some wood flavors and slight raisiny flavor with more citrus peel.   Nice oily mouth feel but the sweetness is too pronounced making this a little medicinal with the lemon peel.

Finish: Medium length with a very tannic drying woody flavor that I did not particularly like.  I appreciated the break from the sweetness but the finish was too tannic for my taste.

Overall this was ok but I felt the flavors were way too sweet and then too dry and tannic on the finish.  I like the green spot better."

4.0,"• Nose (undiluted): almost subdued at first. With time, there’s honey, peaches, lemons, apples, and a floral note almost like fresh spearmint leaves
• Palate (undiluted): rich and full-bodied, sweet citrus fruit, oranges, bananas, a bit nutty (almonds?) with nutmeg and cinnamon developing
• Finish: medium length, fades gently, buttery, croissants, shortbread, vanilla and just a bit of spice lingering, with a touch of flaxseed oil and bitter orange zest at the very end.

With water there are creamy coconut and banana aromas popping out. The texture remains rich and different tropical fruits burst forward: mangoes and pineapple. I think I prefer this one with a touch of water added. That does not happen very often. This whiskey is not “hot” when taken neat, but the flavour profile really does “open up” with just a few scant drops of water. The bitterness at the end is also diminished with water.

This is very friendly whiskey. Anyone who thinks they don’t like sipping whiskey should try this. Fruity, friendly, moreish, and seductive.

Long before the crackly single pot grain flavour registers, it’s fruit, fruit and fruit: raspberries , cherries, maybe even some astringent cranberries lurking in there. It knocks fruity Scotches like Glenfiddich 18 into a cocked hat. The fruit reels out in waves and waves of lusciousness, with warm nutty tones and Terry’s dark chocolate orange as it unfolds. It’s simply a delight from start to finish. Benchmark Irish."

5.0,"Nose: An explosion of fruit and flowers! Candied oranges, berry syrup, plums, and nectarines.  There's a small bit of biscuit and spice back there as well.  There's a smell like one of those pre-packaged vanilla ice cream cones with the sugar cone, vanilla ice cream, chocolate and stale peanut chunk - but of course covered in loads of stewed stone fruits.

Palate:  Thick, sweet, and oily.  It's like fruit syrup on the tongue.  Nice buttery biscuit, a burst of cinnamon, oak, and other spices.  There's a fruity sweetness that I really only ever get from peaches and nectarines - almost tart, but also a little nutty.  A small bit of caramelized sugar, like the crisp outside of a Belgian waffle - loaded with whipped cream and peaches.

Finish:  Loooong... this lasts and lasts - roiling in waves of biscuit, stone fruits, dry, and mouthwatering.  There's some vanilla and cream in those waves as well.

Conclusion: And I never thought I'd find a whiskey as good as Redbreast 12 CS... The amount of stone fruits, floral notes, and vanilla biscuit goodness loaded into this liquid is astounding!  This is an absolutely beautiful whiskey, unlike any I've had before, and it has a permanent place in my cabinet now!"

Before this, I've only had Jameson and Redbreast 12 year cask strength. Loved RB so I decided to try this Irish goodness. I like when tasting notes are include. Unfortunately, I only hit <25% of them. Tasted in GC about 1.5 ounce pour 15 min rest before tasting.

N(4.5): Sweet crisp asian pear. This was consistent throughout. Definitely got some of the sherry influence. The flavors were bright and inviting. Great for spring and summer. Imagine coming in from a warm day and thirst. Picking up something fresh, cold, sweet and vibrant. You just want to chug it. 
P(4.75): Not bold and strong flavors. Instead well balanced and complex. Little surprises around the corner sip after sip. Honey sweetness and coating. Crisp asian pear. Vanilla cookies. 
F(4): delightful. Pears and roses. Not like perfume roses, but a rose tea. Flavors lasted long but the intensity dropped off pretty fast. Which makes you want to drink more but I hope from something more intense."

3.0,"For being very expensive and matured in sherry and Malaga, it’s remarkably tame and pure honey taste. Would not buy."

4.5,"Fractions of citrus, banana and spice. Barley, fruit, and a sweetness fade. With a toasted woody element. Nicely balanced with a creamy texture."

4.0,"Love the initial intensity. Relatively short finish. I taste a minimal, but notable infuse from the sherry. I find it to be sweeter than the green spot. I’m a huge fan"

4.5,"Everything you heard/read about this one is true. Fantastic dram. Much, much better than the also good Green Spot, it missed only one point in my score system to get a 5.0.

Bottled at 46, this is one of the most complex and delicious irish whiskies i have ever had. 

On the nose: Grain whiskey, Malt, Corn, freshly cut Apples, Caramel, Toffee, Vanilla crust and Dulce de leche. 

The palate is very rewarding. Sider, Tobacco, Chocolate and Grain whiskey swetness. It is amazing how grain whiskey can feel so off putting sometimes and in other cases so delicious. Aftertaste is long with a pleasant tobacco and ginger sensation. 

A beautiful dram, specially on the palate, i score it 95 over 100 and definitively recommend it. Slainte!!!"

4.0,A nutty butter biscuit nose with a red fruit and milk chocolate arrival. In the finish the fruitiness sustains with a hint of Cherry Vimto. A lovely whiskey but lacks the extreme creaminess of the cheaper Green Spot.

4.5,"This whiskey is distilled from malted and non malted barley, and has a nose with a lot of cereal and wood, with a strong sweet component of vanilla, maple syrup, caramel, green apple and almonds. Herbaceous background profile, with a slight balsamic note.
The palate is clearly spicy, with nutmeg and star anise, but it is always the sweet side that is the master, here softer and silkier, of butter cookies, lots of fruit (apricot, peach, ripe apple), lemon peel, honey, chocolate chips, caramel, wood. Still a subtle balsamic background note.
The finish is quite long and spicy, of cereal, wood, honey and fruit.
The three casks work together to create a very pleasant and rich whiskey, sweet and fresh at the same time, full of taste and very drinkable. An excellent job."
3.5,"Nose: very sweet, ripe white grapes, white chocolate, fresh summer honey, rhubarb, lemonade and somehow the smell you get from a fresh drafted IPA.

Palate: chocolate butter, malty, sour candy, the fresh and fruity sweetness is well surrounded by a nice oak-wood maturity that adds a delicate bitterness that brings it together quite nicely. In the end there is also oranges, roasted hazelnuts and almonds.

Enjoyable, different, not as light as one might expect, quite intense and rich with a medium alcoholic burn at the right level."
