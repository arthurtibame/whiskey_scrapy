null,The aroma is citrus and wood with a hint of clove in the background. Tasting the dram elicits a variety of orchard fruits. The finish starts with a grassiness that turns woodie then evaporates off the tongue with a tad of peppercorn spice.

4.0,"This is a travel exclusive that I did not know existed until tonight, when Glenmorangie was pouring it at an event to mark the 10th anniversary of its Private Edition series. The 19 was there as a stand in for the Private Edition from 2013, the 19-year-old Elanta. This is a classic malty, creamy Highland whisky, well rounded, robust and long of flavor. Nothing flashy, just a very good Scotch that’s worth picking up if you ever stumble across a bottle."

4.5,Distiller should get this reviewed when they can. Love the singnet and this lives up as well. Honey and soft balanced citrus and a tinge of spice that all work well together. The pears kick in towards the end and it’s a rewarding finish
