4.5,Very smooth and a great taste profile. You can notice the barley which gives it a unique flavor. Would definitely buy again.
3.5,"Sweet nose with vanilla and sweet baking spices, like a finished bread. Smooth mouthfeel, hardly any burn. Vanilla front and center with cinnamon on the tongue. Medium finish lingers with a little smoke and more vanilla. Simple overall but a pleasant sipper that doesn’t need water or ice."

3.75,Good balance and spice
3.0,"Pleasant nose with soft, classic bourbon notes, but also some earthy notes like mushrooms and damp wood. Soft on the palate, with a slightly acidic kick at the end. Some fruit and pecan nibs. Good sipper. Prices vary wildly on this. 10/28/18."
3.0,This wasn’t half bad
