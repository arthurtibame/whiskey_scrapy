3.0,"This is a harmonious blend, but to what end? A nose of powdered white chocolate, dry earth, pressed vanilla, and cream. The palate is round, silky, and tastes quite similar to the bouquet. Vanilla cream, malt chocolate, dried oranges, underripe melon, and a light touch of peat. A lengthy finish makes this a solid sipper or a great aperitif.

This doesn't confound you(which whisky certainly doesn't have to) or seem terribly distinct. In fact it reminds me of whisky from the English Whisky Co., Young Balblair (which I understand is in the blend but not a huge portion), and shows some resemblance to Balvenie Ex-Bourbon First Fill.

So the parts work well together but only to create a style that's already been well established."
