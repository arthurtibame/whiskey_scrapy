4.0,Very light. Very smooth. Doesn't taste like most bourbons. Compliments Cuban cigars very well.

5.0,"Best bourbon I’ve had. Lots of great flavors, just the right amount of burn. Has a great cigar box tobacco note to it, I had a Single barrel reserve, hand selected by Jonathon Maisano for Maisano’s in Ocean Springs, MS."
4.0,"smooth and strong.  oaky with not a lot of burn.  While it does taste heavier than many standard bourbons, for a cask strength it doesn't pack that ""punch in the mouth"" potency and is very smooth"
