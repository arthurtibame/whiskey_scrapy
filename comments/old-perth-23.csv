4.75,"Silky smooth, sweet with hints of caramels and vanilla. First impression was “syrup whiskey”. Amazing blend."
4.5,"Distilled 1994, Single Cask 45%

Nose - Rich fruity caramel, stewed dark red berries, chocolate covered toffee, candied ginger, candied orange

Taste - Very light heat/tingle, rich dark red berries, candied ginger, oaky caramel, leather dryness/bitterness, bitter dark chocolate, coffee toffee

Finish - Lingering dryness, fruity oak, lingering dark red berry sweet, similar to a cranberry-cherry juice blend w/ the same amount of sweet-tart, hint of dark chocolate covered coffee toffee

Score - 89/100

Final Thoughts - This one had an an amazing nose, which sort of sets the expectations a bit high as you don't quite get all of those intense flavors on the palate. It smells like a dessert dram, but drinks like a nicely sherried everyday drinker. Not saying that's a bad thing, but I was just hoping for a bit more of that intense caramel/toffee sweetness on the palate that I got in the nose. Overall a very nice blend with no off-putting notes and is actually quite nicely balanced. Bitterness tones down the sweetness to a good level. I guess I'm just being picky on how the nose didn't translate 1 to 1 on the palate.
