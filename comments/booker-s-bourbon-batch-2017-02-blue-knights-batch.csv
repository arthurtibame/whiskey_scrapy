3.5,"As with most cask strength spirits, the heat can be felt on the nose but for this bookers release you also get vanilla and even some smoke and leather.  The ethanol still dominates though.

The palate is unfortunately disappointing. The heat is felt quickly with the high proof but quickly followed by caramel.  It really is pretty one dimensional.  It's not bad, but the faint leather and smoke from the nose is not even there.  Maybe slightly on the finish but even that is subdued and you really just feel the burn on the way down with a touch of spice.

Adding a bit of water doesnt really do too much besides lessening the ethanol ambush on the nose and on the way down.  It's still one dimensional with caramel leading the charge.

I've had a few of the bookers bourbons but this one seems more useful in a high quality cocktail like a mint julep over just sipping it on its own.  Decent but ultimately disappointing."

4.0,"Nose: vanilla and burn on the nose
Palate: very hot and Spicy. The sweetness takes a hit from the burn. But a little vanilla shows through. 
Finish: caramel and the burn holds for a while"

3.0,"Paid $59.99 @ BevMo.
This is an odd batch in my opinion. The main reason being it's the least complex Booker's I have had to date. It's more spicy than sweet. It's pretty smooth for Booker's. I'm fact it's greatest stregth may be that it's the easiest Booker's btach to drink I have had. If that pleases you, pick it up. If like me, you are a Booker's junkie and like the heat and complexity, skip this batch. Go for the ""Off Your Rocker"" or "" Tommy's"" batches. Both are much much better"

4.0,"Nose: vanilla, black pepper.
Palate: spice, hints of citrus and malt, finish is short and spicy.
Water balances the nose and palate, brings forth a nice sweetness.
Overall, this is probably my current favorite bourbon. It has everything I like in a ryed expression."

Personal Rating: 8.25/10
Notes: As usual, I LOVE Booker’s! It consistently delivers a delicious pour regardless of the batch. Some I like more than others, but all too notch nonetheless. As for the Blue Knight Batch I have here, for me it seems to have replaced the familiar leathery flavor for notes of peanut and moss. Which is surprisingly pleasant. The more I drink, the more the peanut comes forward. It is pretty warm, so I could recommend adding some water or an ice cube...but I won’t because I enjoy it just as it is. As with any batch of Booker’s, do yourself a favor and grab a bottle"

4.0,"This is the first batch of Booker's I've tried, and it's quite enjoyable.  The nose has so much cherry sweetness, a real Cherry Vanilla Coke aroma to it.  There's a tiny bit of oak, but not as much as I'd want.  The full proof doesn't really rear up and smack me in the face, which surprises me a bit given its relatively young age of slightly over 6 years.  Must be good barrel selection.  The palate has a heavy tannin presence, and is where the oak appears in force.  It's a teethcoater for sure, with a rich, luxurious flavor and an almost waxy texture.  The finish is really nice, dark stewed fruits, almost like a cherry pie, mixing in with the heat from the proof and loads of cinnamon and oak.  After having about half of it, I dropped some water in, which brought vanilla cream to the fore, and made the palate a bit more vibrant.  The finish unfortunately doesn't benefit from water; I get honey and some citrus tartness, and the astringency from the wood becomes too pronounced.  I have a hard time seeing them successfully pushing the price of this line all the way up to $100, because it's a clear cut or two below Elijah Craig Barrel Proof (which is still $70-80) in my book."

4.25,"Wow.  A punch in the face if your not ready.  A wonderful dram!  The color is a nice shade of gold.  Tastes of dark, dark chocolates and spice.  The finish goes on and on!"
4.0,"Plenty of heat on the nose per usual, but with an interesting nutty tartness. The high heat opens up to cinnamon, bark, toast, moss, and that punchy heat. Hard to roll around on the tongue, but a welcome lingering bite."

3.0,"Dilluted down to about 47% I get a lot of black licorice and black pepper spice on the palate. It's nice, but not spectacular. My brother picked up a bottle for me during his trip to the U.S. Impossible to get here otherwise."

4.0,"Patience is a virtue. Only took about 6-7 months for these to drop from $98 to $53 at my local exchange. 

Vanilla cherry coke, butter, corn husk, white chocolate, burnt sugar, cedar, and cinnamon.

Overall enjoyable and worth the $53. If it's in the $90s in your area, grab yourself a Jack Daniels Barrel Proof."

3.75,"decent taste but it's almost masked by the proof rolling over the palate. tried neat & ice. ice brought out a sweet streak, but not enough to overcome the tartness. overall not bad but not a go to."
4.5,"Served neat in a rocks glass at the bar from a bottle that was 80% empty, so I suspect it had time to soften in the bottle.

Reminds me of a sweet rum syrup with a hint of black tea and a subtly hot spice character on the back end. Great length of finish with a low burn. 

Perfect balance with a recognizable Booker's flavor profile. Similar to 2018-4 ""Kitchen Sink"" 

Expectedly excellent"
3.5,More oak on the nose and taste than other expressions of Bookers. Syrupy sweetness on the top of the tongue transitions quickly to oak bitterness and a slightly sour finish.
