3.5,"North Star Spirits tasting event, Sydney, February 21, 2020, Whisky #5

Nose: Mild but well-defined smoke aromas. Honey, tinned fruit salad, porridge and a yeasty ale-like note. It’s a little sweaty and earthy (some folks like to call that “funk”). An interesting nose.

Palate: There’s a big, earthy, sweet pepper arrival but a solid smoky quality quickly arises to take centre stage. Leathery malt, semi-sweet fruit, lemon juice, bouquet garni and mild smoked fish on the development. Adding water intensified the smoke notes in a very agreeable way (see below). Good chewy, oily texture.

Finish: Medium/long. Soft, dry peaty notes that linger together with a little herbal honey.

A whisky that was produced as an experimental run by Edrington, the previous owners of Glenturret. At first, I didn’t know what to make of it as the peated note was unexpected and the nose has some odd qualities. However I soon settled into its groove and came to enjoy it a lot. It has a simultaneously clean and dirty character and just the right sort of smokiness.

The smoke is of the highland variety but it’s not a dense and pungent bonfire. It’s more subtle than that, but still pervasive, and is like burning grass in the distance - a soft and cosy autumnal smoke. It reminded me slightly of Glenglassaugh Torfa (in fact it might be better) and also a little of Benromach Peat Smoke (but it’s not a bonfire).

The distillate must have been immense when new, and probably undrinkable. A refill bourbon hogshead was the perfect vehicle for this whisky, providing just the right combination of additive and extractive maturation and the right fruity tones. It would not have worked as well with sherry cask ageing, I’m sure.

Although it was cask strength the alcohol was not intrusive, however it was a little tight and adding water revealed more smoke, but no plastic notes. The rest of the profile stayed much the same.

It’s a pity that this was tasted towards the end of the evening following four highly sherried whiskies. I would have liked to get to know it with a fresh palate and I have a feeling that if I could I’d rate it more highly. I’m almost tempted to buy a whole bottle just so I can get to grips with it better.

“Good” : 3.5 stars"
