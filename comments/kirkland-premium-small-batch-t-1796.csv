2.0,"Neat in Glencairn at home.  Thanks for the bottle, Randy B. (this is being written before tasting).

Nose is spice-forward, with some vanilla and woody notes coming through.  Perhaps a bit dusty.  Taste is grassy and astringent, thin and full of ethanol, with dust and tree bark as well.  No, no, and again no.  Not undrinkable, but just barely so.  2/13/2020."
3.5,"Nose: vanilla, cherry, brown sugar
Taste: vanilla, little heat, brown sugar and peanut in the finish"

3.25,"It got better as I got further into the bottle.(not in one sitting) Balance could be better as I get more of an alcohol taste than I'd like. I've had several higher proof bourbons that have a better taste balance. For its price point it is fine but not a ""hidden gem""."
2.5,A little spicy for me
