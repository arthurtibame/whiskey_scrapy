5.0,"Batch 041 sherry cask 2014 release. Great stuff with notes of christmas cake, sherry, toffee, chocolate, nuts, vanilla, toffee, apricot, sultanas, nuts, honey, pepper, raisins, and citrus. Tried this among 11 drammers club pours, 7 of which were at least 20 years old"

3.0,"An aroma of sizzling malt(from the alcohol), vanilla, short bread cookies, dry peat, but a bit of ethanol. The palate starts with vanilla cream, short bread, orange zest, a bit of peat smoke, and a lengthy spice driven finish. I was surprised at how long my mouth was watering, between the aggressive spice finish and the heat from the alcohol. It's subtle but a little too much so, the alcohol plays more of a role than it should."
