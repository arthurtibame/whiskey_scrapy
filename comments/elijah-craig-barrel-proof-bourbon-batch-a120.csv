4.75,"Neat. Neck pour.  Stumbled on the A120 today, gave up hope of finding it honestly.  But found a dozen on the shelf at Party Source like its no big deal, in June five months after release.  I adore the B520, whiskey of the year candidate.  Let’s see how A120 stacks up.

Nose kicks ass.  Buttery sweet rolls.  Charred caramel.  Powdered sugar.  Butter cream.  Nice sweet oak.  Man this is delicious smelling.  The more I sit with it, it even reminds me of frying French Toast.  No no no.  It’s elephant ears.  That fried batter and then that powdered sugar.  That’s a cool nose and memory trigger.  Straight back to King’s Island or festivals.  

Oh man it tastes like it too.  Oh that and more.  Wow.  I need to compare this to B520...  Texture is perfect and creamy.  Sweet oak, cinnamon and brown sugar up front.  Transitions to that delicious fried batter and powdered sugar.  Then comes the charred caramel and leaves you with the sweet oak.  

Oh man I love ECBP.  It’s on such an amazing hot streak right now."

4.25,"The nose is hot at first, which is not surprising given the proof. There’s cinnamon and other baking spices, vanilla frosting, a little cut grass, a dark caramelized fruit note, corn, maple syrup, cola and some leather. 

The palate is sweet, thick and oily with the tongue and cheeks drying out leaving you with a sort of lingering chalky feeling.  There are dried dark cherries, a ton of baking spices, oak, leather, cola, and a little bit of that cut grass comes through. Its very interesting how coating and oily this one is, while also giving you that drying chalky effect in your mouth, especially the longer you let it hang out before you swallow.

The Finish is very long with an initial pop of spiciness, cola and sweet corn that fades into light vanilla and oak, with some barrel char that rises to the surface after a while.

This one is great.  I love how viscous it is and how there are some fruit notes that made its way into this batch. Even though there is some grassiness/earthyness that comes through, (I get that in a lot of these) its not as dominant as in past batches, which is a welcome change. 

On a side note, I know there are a lot of people that swear by batch C919, but this one wins for me, even though it comes off a little hotter, it’s just better."
5.0,"One word. Phenomenal! But seriously, super sweet. Super rich. Super long. What else were you expecting?"
3.75,"Nose- Brown Sugar, molasses 

Palate- very sweet up front with the molasses taste, has a definite spice to it, also hints of tobacco

Finish- long and good 

I had previously taken two drinks out of the bottle before posting and it definitely opened up over the last three weeks"

5.0,"I'm going to make a premature proclamation, this will be crowned Whiskey of the year 2020 by numerous publications/competition's. The members of the Arizona Whiskey Community are probably tired of hearing me sing it's praises but this Bourbon is the truth! I've pitted against 8 of my favorite Barrel Proof Bourbon's and only George T Stagg has prevailed. Put simply, this is the best ECBP since the old label! Let's dive into the tasting:

This one is big and brash. Mouthcoating with an oily texture. Lovely butterscotch bomb with brown sugar and an array of baking spices. A healthy dose of oak and long vanilla and dark chocolate finish with oak spices lingering on the tongue forever! This is what a proper barrel proof Bourbon should be like! Outstanding!

If you see it buy 2! Cheers all!"
4.0,"Hot Butterscotch. In a face-off with C919, the A120 is very similar in nose and palate, but drinks considerably hotter. The C919 is a bit darker (i.e., leather), but is more balanced and a bit more pleasant considering that they are essentially the same proof. I like both, but C919 gets the nod. Both bottles have been open for a couple of weeks, so let’s see if A120 closes the (small) gap in a few weeks. If C919 is still on the shelf in your hood, I recommend bunkering 1 or 2 as this is the best of the 2019 batches IMO. Don’t fret if A120 hasn’t made it your way yet......good juice (as are all ECBP’S), but not next level."

4.5,"Nose - the word BIG comes to mind, strong vanilla, caramel, cherry, butterscotch, leather, strong oak, roasted peanuts, chocolate, moderate ethanol burn.

Taste - deep, rich vanilla, caramel, cherry, strong oak, cinnamon, bubble gum?, BOURBON cranked up to 12, finishing long, sweet, and woody.

I can feel my taste buds sizzling and screaming in agony. Like I licked a stick of old spice...but in a good way. Raging, angry, raw bourbon flavors. Beautiful, but I think I slightly prefer the more refined, uncut palate the bookers releases offer, but this is still so pure and excellent."
3.0,"Nose - First note is that I really can't smell this well. It's just so hot that it's hard to note it. I'll honestly have to add water to give notes. So i get chocolate, cherries, and oak. It's weirdly not nosing that well, I know I've written a few reviews tonight a bit down on the nose, this isn't a bad nose, it's just I am not smelling much. What's here is great.

Poured another half dram and the nose is exploding. Maybe the last glass being freshly cleared was the issue? I have no idea. Anyway no real change to the score or impact, same notes, just a hell of a lot more of them. 

Taste - I get berries and oak and cream and vanilla. It's just rich and hot and bitter. Water - So now I get more oak, more tannin, and more complex transitions. This is really pushing on the oaks and bitters and sweets. OK and I'm now getting some heaven hill nutty notes too.

So this is very good bourbon but there's a lot of problems and flaws.

I'm at 3.0 but odds are to be honest C919 I scored a 3.75 and to be honest I think that was an over rating. But that said this is not as good as the C919 or last year's A for that matter but if you like any ECBP you'll enjoy this one."

4.25,Delicious and as hot as expected. It actually drinks a touch hotter than the c919 which is actually slightly higher proof.
4.75,"Well ECBP has become my torchbearer for quality whiskey that you can actually still find on shelves. At $60 it isn't too far up the cost chain to make it unreasonable if you drink in moderation so I consider it a gem. Have heard mixed reviews on this batch so here we go...

Nose is very full bodied of molasses and caramel. This has not a hint of ethanol and begs to be tasted. First sip washes warm brown sugar across your tongue with hints of vanilla, caramel, and maybe a touch of peanuts.  The burn is somewhat short considering this one comes in north of 136 proof, but the caramel lingers long after.  Verdict here is that EC keeps producing a great dram with the BP offerings."

4.75,"Just blind it, regardless of price this is an exceptional bourbon.  At $59 it’s a must buy in my book.  Love the C918, A120 , I like the C919 slightly better out of the three.  Splitting hairs I know,  similar, but I’m a proof guy and C919 is a very balanced medley of caramel, vanilla, brown sugar, nutmeg, tobacco(light), red fruit, and sweet oak.  The C919 edges this (sweater, smoother, higher proof)  but still great.  ECBP is the best available bourbon I can find most all the time and would put against most all of those you will never find( except WLW).  A120 is REALLY good but C919 is best so far for me."
4.25,"Very smooth for such high proof, get woody, and baking spices on the nose and a alcohol hit on the tongue. Little bit of water really opens it up to some baked restaurant bread flavors and some nuttiness."

4.5,"Comes with the heat but is extremely smooth despite the proof. Nose is thick and complex with light fruits and hints of vanilla, cinnamon and tobacco. Very rich, round and complex finish that lingers on the tongue with long finish, but in a good way. Definitely would recommend.

I use the rating scale below. Distiller uses a scale of 5 and I use a scale of 10, but I’m sure you’re not too drunk to do the math! 

1. Disgusting - So bad I poured it out.
2. Poor - I wouldn't consume by choice.
3. Bad - Multiple flaws.
4. Below average - Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.
5. Good - Just average.
6. Very Good - Better than average.
7. Great - Well above average.
8. Excellent - In a league of its own.
9. Incredible - An all-time favorite.
10. Perfect"

4.25,"Aroma- boozy vanilla and citrus fruit / Taste - Toffee and spice blend smoothly into toasted vanilla. The texture is vicous and butter, like you're chewing on a caramel / finish - long lasting and complex."
4.5,"Nose has loads of vanilla, burnt caramel, molasses and oak.

Palate starts with sticky dark brown sugar and leather, quickly moving to charred cinnamon with subtle dark fruits topped with orange zest.

Finish gives more barrel char, dark fruits with buttery caramel and spice.

Amazing!"
4.0,"Hints of caramel, vanilla, walnuts and crusty bread on the nose. Although this does drink hot, I get cherry, caramel and vanilla on taste with a mellow oak finish."

4.5,Best batch since the 139.4 squat. This has notes reminiscent of the glory days of ecbp.
4.0,"It's no hidden fact that this is one of the most highly sought after barrel proof bourbons, and it's got great reasons to back it up, too. Back when Heaven Hill was the number one media target, you could forget about finding this (enough people always ruin everything), but I ran into it while doing some shelf shopping, and since it was fully stocked at this store, I felt it was a good time to properly acknowledge and revisit it.

It's obvious that ethanol is going to be a huge part to the nose. Once you realize this, you'll go past it to find a healthy fistful of fresh rye spice, and that well known number 4 barrel char, but with even more depth, like you scraped some of the wood actually off of the barrel into your glass. Like regular Elijah Craig, there's not much more to the scent; as I've said before, simple, uncomplicated bourbons and whiskeys usually yield the best results.

First few tastes immediately let the caramel shine, which is to expected. My second phase tasting (swish, swallow, don't open mouth for air) was definitely pretty tough to get through, as the ethanol and rye spice almost murdered it's way through my nostrils. Once I was able to let it breathe through the third phase and beyond, the rye can be tasted very well. It goes back to what I said before, where this is a simple recipe to begin with, and if it ain't broke...

All in all, this is certainly one of the most memorable barrel proof bourbons I've ever had. I remember having it years ago at the distillery and certainly craving it since then. However, the media boom killed that craving really quick. Now that that is over, I find this extremely dark, full, billboard impression of a true bourbon to be something I'll try to continuously buy and happily display in my collection."
