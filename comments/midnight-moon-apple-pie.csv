3.75,"Apples, cinnamon, etc"
3.0,More cinnamon then apple pie. This is an update review after finishing the jar. Definitely more cinnamon then apple. However it seems to have mellowed as the jar went on. Not a bad product at all and I’ve consider buying it again.

2.25,Bought on a whim.  Barely any perceptible apple and heavy on the cinnamon.  Homemade is that much better.
3.75,"This would almost seem to belong in the LIQUER section of Distillr with it's lower ABV and its mix of apple juice and a cinnamon stick that floats in the bottle. For what it is, it is very good. I keep some in the freezer when I have friends over who are in the mood to ""shoot"". It also makes an excellent summer cocktail mixed with club soda or ginger ale. In the winter it heats up nicely for a good toddy. I'm not a fan of flavored spirits, but I can appreciate when one is done right, and Midnight Moon Apple Pie is done right."
