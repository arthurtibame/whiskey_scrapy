3.5,Sherry & raisins on the nose. Sweet sherry oak in the taste with a short but stronger finish

3.5,"Nose: very prominent sherry influence, with plenty of baked apple, ripe apricot, and orange notes.

Palate: the ripe fruit notes from the sherry show plenty of flavour with orange, abricot, and plum, followed by a brief peper spice.

Overall, very surprising for a speyside. But in a good way."
