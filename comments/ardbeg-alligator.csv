TASTE:  BBQ, artichoke , crème brûlée,  caramel

Water - no water needed. One of my favorites!"
5.0,"Another unicorn from this week’s Ardbeg tasting and another home run. Take the typical peppery nose and sprinkle on some sweet cinnamon. That theme continues on the palate and finish: it’s sweet, rich and peppery in the mouth and has a super long aftertaste of creamy cinnamon. Hard to pick favorites from the stellar line-up of the night but this was the one I reached for when we were finishing off the bottles at the end of the evening."
5.0,"Drammers Club pour. Great stuff with notes of Vanilla, Orange, Cherry, White Chocolate, Peach, Caramel, Pepper, Smoke, Salt, Dark Chocolate, Mackerels, Raisins, Pineapple, Banana, Coconut, Cinnamon, Baking Spices, and Citrus"
4.0,"From a tasting on 12-29-18 here is my review:  This is a snappy dram with a bit of a bite.  Full of Sweet, Peat, and Heat when tasted neat.  Same with each repeat.  A drop of water mutes it for a few seconds, then blows up into a flavor explosion and a long, lingering finish.  Moderately complex and damn tasty!"

4.0,"Overall:  Another Ardbeg delight, sweet and sour smoke, fun to drink, not as good as “the Beast.” Ardbeg is trying to displace Talisker as my favorite distillery.
Color:  Burnt gold
Nose:  Honey, smoke, oak, vanilla, citrus, buttered rum, chocolate. Water brings out a briny quality and mint (crazy)
Body:  Medium, silky smooth
Taste:  Sweet and tangy, with hardwood charcoal, spicy notes, water brings out the salt.
Finish:  Long and peppery, with charcoal embers, and white chocolate.
Score: 88"
