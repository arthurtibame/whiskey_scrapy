4.25,"Firstly, at around 115 proof, it's incredibly smooth, not much ethanol on the nose or palate.

The smoke is very present on the nose and palate, think a very intense camp fire, no brine at all.  After it subsides it openes to a lovely dark fruit sweetness. 

Overall I really enjoyed this, a little more ageing could have gone a long way, as smoke can be a bit spikey.  Great whisky even if it's a little unbalanced, B+"
4.0,"Another freebie pre old and rare tasting. Really nice dram, was up to 4.25 no water until i compared it to the old and rare selection. For the price still deserves the rating but overall tasted a lot younger and ethanolly in comparison. 3.75 to 4"
