4.0,"Some call it lightweight, but all notes are in perfect definition for me, like HiFi. It just works for me. Good balance between sherried, (sweet) dryness and wood. All I ask for in this whisky. Doesn't seem too popular, but strangely enough I always come back for this one. Love the bottle. I try not to drink other whiskey's before this one; it's too delicate for that. I like to start the evening with a glass of Glenfarclas 10 yo (or cheaper 12yo) and let the others follow"

3.0,"This is an nice aperitif. You get small helpings of sweet and savory. The nose has sweet smoke, honey, tiny berry fruit, and vanilla malt. The palate is primarily honeyed fruit, smoked malt, biscuits, and dry wood. 

This reminds me a little of young whiskies from The Balvenie. Mostly due to the honey, biscuits and overall light profile."

3.0,"Well, I'm stuck inside after Snowpocalypse 2017 here in central Virginia.  When I finally got home from work after digging out of 10-11 inches of fresh snow, I was I dire need of an attitude adjustment.  Why not open the other half of my Christmas care package from my buddy, P-Mac.  This is a young, Scottish single malt from Glenfarclas.  It's the entry level 10 Year Old.  Let's give it a run, shall we...

The 'Farclas 10 is a Speysider that comes in at the standard 80 proof and is a beautiful, shiny gold in the taster.  It's been breathing for about 10-15 minutes now and the initial nose is heavy spice cake with an underlying and tempered, but peppery oak.  It seems pretty inviting.

That first sip is cloyed honey.  It really seems over the top and takes a minute before clearing up and washing away with a blast of cinnamon and peppered oak cask.  There isn't much complexity, but then again it's a youthful whisky.  It finishes kind of harsh (again, age is probably the key factor) and seems very predictable:  sweet, then spicy.  There's probably several who consider this in their wheelhouse, I'm just not one of them.

It might sound unfair, and this is only my second GlenFarclas, but I don't really ""get"" this whisky (and maybe the distillery as a whole).  They get outstanding reviews from a lot of websites and seasoned reviewers, I just can't seem to figure out why it doesn't work for me.  Apologies to Paul, I hate to look like an ass and give a gift a poor rating, but I can't really get into this one.  Hopefully, it will grow on me a bit as I drink through the bottle.  2.75 stars.  Cheers, my friends"

3.0,"This 10 year old Speyside single malt comes in at the minimum 40% ABV. I believe it is non chill filtered. I know that it is natural color, which is amber gold. 

I spent the last two nights pondering over a 5oz sample sent to me by Lee G. Here is what I found. 

On the initial pour and only a couple minute wait I was slapped in the face by a big oak 4x4 and not really in a good way. It was definitely harsh, so I decided to let it sit for another 10 minutes. So glad I did. Fresh cut damp wood, sherried oak and sherried fruits, but not very sweet fruits. A brief hit of rubber tires (not unpleasant) that faded fast. Summertime grasses, light lemongrass. A light nuttiness and some malty notes. Dried apricots or nectarines. As the level in the glass goes down a syrupy sweetness starts to develop. It ends with more wet wood and sherried fruits. 

The palate has a much spicier arrival than I expected, but nothing compared to a Talisker 10 for example. Heavy oak and oak spices. Sherried oak. There is a hint of cayenne pepper (flavor more than heat) that is brief and fleeting. Sherried dried fruits round it out. 

The mouthfeel is fairly dense and a bit oily. The finish is medium short, dry with a bit of sherry sweetness. 

Time and patience is needed with this single malt more than most. It really demands your focus to pick out everything. If you can get past the initial blast of oak there are lots of subtle flavors to be discovered. This 10 year old shows both it's youth and a complexity beyond its age. The nose shows more like a 12 or 15 year old (closer to 12 though). The difference between the 10 and the 25 year old is huge, but I am not disappointed with the 10. I am really getting on board the Glenfarclas train and I plan to get the 12, 17, and 21 year old expressions in the future. Maybe some day I will spring for the 30. Thanks again to Lee for the generous sample. Solid 3.5. Cheers"

3.5,"Nose: A nicely balanced combination of malt, sherry, good quality oak, dark fruits and restrained smokiness. There are also lemongrass and stone-fruit notes that shine against the darker aromas and these amplify as it rests in the glass.

Palate: The arrival is firm, semi-sweet and malty-cereal in nature, with bitter orange marmalade at the sides. It develops very well with dark honey and subtle menthol and eucalyptus notes emerging together with a little tannic spice. It's full and oily at the beginning but the tight tannins quickly bring a sense of dryness. A raisin note appears towards the finish, and there's a nutty (Brazil nut? walnut?) presence throughout.

Finish: Medium. Fruity (figs and dates) and semi-sweet sherry with a black coffee tang to the aftertaste.

Like all big whiskies this benefits from resting in the glass - give it at least 10 minutes before tasting but nose it all the while - you can't miss how the nose changes and opens over time, becoming distinctly fruitier. Both the nose and palate have the overarching dark (almost burnt) fruitcake character that is common to all Glenfarclas. It's likely a result of the direct-fired stills and is their signature note.

It's odd that the 8-12 year old expressions are so often dismissed or overlooked.  I think it's partly because the distillery produces a lot of reasonably priced older bottlings and there is an assumption that the less matured ones are somehow ""callow"".  I couldn't disagree more. Also quite a few critics and commentators have remarked on the boldness of the Glenfarclas new-make and how it can take long maturation, but ""can take"" is not the same as ""needs"".

The 10 year old Glenfarclas is an assured and dignified malt that probably appeals more to a palate that is familiar with whisky than to the novice. You need to know what to look for, otherwise the character can be elusive or may even seem generic. If your last taste of a ""young"" Glenfarclas was a while ago at the start of your whisky journey then I'd encourage you to try one again.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars."

3.5,"Dateline, Prairie du Chien: Went to a friend's birthday party at a bar. I got two drinks - EH Taylor and this, neither of which were new to me. What was new to me was paying a combined $12 or so for my drinks, both of which were basically just Old Fashioned glasses filled 3/4 or so up with booze, neat. I love Wisconsin.

It was nice to be reacquainted with the entry level Glenfarclas bottle, which is a fairly simple, easygoing single malt with that nutty quality shared by all of the distillery's bottlings. It lacks the complexity and nuance of older Glenfarclas bottles, as it's a pretty straightforward affair, but it's at least an enjoyable simplicity."

4.0,"I have been sipping this off and on for the past three years, since I first tried it. I really enjoy it. There are notes of biscuit, oak, malt, honey, dried fruit, and vanilla. The sherry influence is just right for me, an accent and smoothness---not a sherry bomb. This is not quite as smooth as the impressive 12 yro, but I think I prefer it. It is a wonderfully crafted whisky with wonderful nuances of flavor, but knows it is a whisky.  This is one I would consider keeping with me on a desert isle.  It is that enjoyable for my palate."

3.5,"I feel i had high hopes for this one, but it was kind of disappointing, since it is a normal dram, not too many things happening here, and you cant say it is bad, but it is not great, it is fair. 

Bottled at 40%Abv, it has a beautiful burnished color. On the nose it is very very very difficult to percieve since its aroma is ""deaf"", meaning you have to put your whole nose to a test here. I followed another reviewer's advice (Paul Macieri) to let it sit, and it grew a little bit, helping me to get all the notes that i will proceed to describe:

after Hiding its notes under the glass, i got ashes (like a extinguished bonfire peatyness), berries, prunes peel, dry apricot peel, caramel (toffee) and a little bit of a malty oakyness. This is the most fruity whisky i have ever nosed, almost chewable, maybe because i had to stick my nose into the glencairn glass for a couple of minutes. 

On the Palate it is hot, but manageable, oaky, earthy, grassy, a little peated, very little. finish is short-medium, and it is medium bodied. 

after adding just one little drop of water the whole aroma faded, to never return again, but in the palate changed everything. As soon as you taste it spices which werent there at all without water, start to rise to give you a full spicy mouth, similar to black pepper or ginger. 

it is a fair whisky, maybe it is not for me, but i have had better. As a fact, yesterday i had macallan 10yo fine oak and that one is far superior. cheers!"
