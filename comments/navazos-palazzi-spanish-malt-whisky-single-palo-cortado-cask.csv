4.0,"Finally a whisky for Tequila lovers! If you have ever had any good Anejo tequila, you will feel right at home. And at cask strength this might be an overall better bargain ;-).  One dram down and I didn't even realise it. If there is a category for smooth summer whiskies, this will win that bout for sure. Very thin mouthfeel, doesn't overwhelm the palate. The only negative is the finish which is pretty short and that comes along with some bitterness.

With a tsp of water you get some floral notes, doesn't do much to the finish (very short again) or the bitterness..Overall a very enjoyable dram.."
