4.25,"Expected a spicy rye with subtle bitters and overly sweet vermouth to balance. Pleasantly surprised it was really well put together. Poured neat, it’s easy to taste a smokiness and slight spice, possibly from a blend of the Campfire and Rendezvous whiskies. Slight sweet from Vermont and bitters. Mellows quick when on the rocks. I’d recommend putting it in a shaker with ice to chill and strain into a glass to preserve the flavors."
