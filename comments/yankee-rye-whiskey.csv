4.0,A lot of honey and apple on the palate. Unusual and interesting rye.
3.75,I really enjoyed this rye. It was full of flavor and went down smooth. There was a very enjoyable lingering aftertaste. I would enjoy a full bottle of this in my rotation of go to whiskeys.
3.75,"Nice honey flavor coming through here -- don't be afraid of the price, there's good stuff in here."
3.5,"I know it's pretty expensive, but this stuff is also pretty good. My first impression was that of bourbon smoke but that diminishes very quickly and becomes the rye it truly is."

2.0,"Nose: pepper, cinnamon, lemon windex, vanilla, medicinal, toasted marshmallow
    
    Taste: sour lemon, chili pepper, spice, nylon, cinnamon, young
    
    Finish: peppercorn, iodine
    
    Overall: A little too young and sour for my taste. Not much oil. Another 1-3 years of aging would round out the sour and make it more complex. Water kills it and takes away most of the nose and the spice in the taste"
