2.0,"Nose is distinctly fruity, reminiscent of a packet of basset fruit salads. Initially on the palate it seems quite light but the finish is long and harsher than expected from a Dalwhinnie. It burns like a winters chill, even though this is suggested in the name its not nessecarily a good thing."

4.0,"Drinking as suggested, from freezer. Slow, viscous pour. Astringent nose. Floral. A gentler single malt. Smart gimmick. I bought into it but then again I come from a winter country (Canada). Bottle purchased at distillery in Scotland for me as gift. Not available in Ontario. Glenfiddich's Winter Storm is $350 here so maybe it's better the Dalwhinnie isn't available. I don't know anyone else who's even heard of it. Suckers."

4.0,"krachtig kruidig, prikt scherp, citrus fris"
3.0,"Scotland, September 2017. Whisky #12

Nose: Fruity, vanilla, honey.

Palate: Honey sweet with raisin and milk chocolate notes. Sweet rich and rounded.

Finish: Medium, mainly fruity sweet.

Nice whisky, very easy to drink. A few drops of water opens it up. Hard not to like but lacking the complexity to make it really interesting.

The Dalwhinnie 15 year is less immediately sweet and rich but has a more subtle, and ultimately more rewarding, profile. I'd rate them as roughly equal with this expression having a slightly sweeter presentation overall. Good value, and nothing in particular to criticize.

""Above Average"" : 3 stars"

5.0,I fell in unconditional love with Dalwhinnie on the day I visited their distillery in Scotland 2 years ago. I did not want to leave at the end of the day. But having purchased a few bottles I’ve been a devoted follower and buying a Dalwhinnie wherever in NYC I find one. Perfect for turning a non-whisky drinker into a single-malt connoisseur. Highly recommended (and ‘15’)  as well as paying a pigrimage to Dalwhinnie’s distillery when in the Highlands.

3.5,"this old friend has been with me for several years now.  It's been overlooked for newer and more american whiskey stars as I explored the realm of bourbon.  Tonight,  I say goodbye to this sweet gem.  It's gentle flavor is like sipping honey while salt spray from the ocean makes a subtle appearance in your glass. If you could taste the color gold, this would be it.  

My tastes have outgrown this tame liquid but I will remember it fondly after finishing the last of the bottle while watching the vicar of dibley"

3.5,"It’s an interesting concept to make a cold weather whisky in Scotland.  It’s seldom exactly warm here.  Dalwhinnie Distillery is at a high altitude in a beautiful, fairly remote location and does tend to get some pretty typically ‘Scottish’ weather.  They suggest you serve straight from the freezer.  To my taste, it enhances the spicy notes, but dulls some of the lighter flavours.

The upfront flavour is a wide range of spices and a good hit of alcohol.  It has a sweet honey note and a background of light smoke, but mostly it’s the spice that dominates - pepper, chilli, cinnamon.

The flavour develops to bring out the fruit, apple and orange, but this is very much second fiddle to the spice.  It has a pleasant medium long spicy, peppery finish.

For it’s cheap price point, this is a very lovely dram.  I’ve gone through a few bottles of this already and it will have a regular place in my cabinet."

3.5,"Light and citrusy up front, then a nice amount of ""scotch"" flavor, then a nice smoky back end. But it finishes with a sharp taste in the back of the mouth. It would be really nice without the finishing note."

3.5,"I am very ashamed that after 347 whiskies, i just had a Dalwhinnie, one of ""the 6 classic malts of Scotland"". And i am not even going for the most iconic and classic one, the 15yo. 

This one called ""winter's gold"" has the perk of been distilled only in winter, so that's that. 

43%abv, Burnished gold color. Yep, winter and golden. 

On the nose it is quite good, with wedding cake notes, strawberry marmalade, burnt cake crest and heather. Actually it prepared me for a great time in the palate that just didn't happen.

On the palate, prunes, earthy peatiness, salt and coastal flavors. Reminds me too much of an Oban. Aftertaste is very, very, very short and that is why it lost most of the points. 

Overall this is a pleasant dram, nothing from out of this world and you won't die if you never taste it, 71 over 100."
