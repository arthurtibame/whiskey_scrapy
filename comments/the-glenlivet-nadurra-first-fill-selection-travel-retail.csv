4.0,"My fourth, and so far favorite Glenlivet, this Nadurra First Fill selection, has a solid aroma and a good taste. 

Bottled at 48%abv, with a White Wine color (the lightest color i have ever found in a whisky)

On the nose: 
BANANA. a lot of Bananas, a whole bunch of them. Also a champagne aroma and maybe some spices. This Glenlivet does have an aroma not like the other expressions, with dim almost ghostly aroma.

On the palate, it is an spice bomb, very versatile, ginger and pepper. Banana is also present, toffee, and a small biterness. 

The aftertaste is long, with liquorice notes, very appealing. 

Overall i gave this one an 89 over 100, and i definitively recommend this one. Beautiful."

4.0,"Not 100% sure which Nadurra I actually got, but it was arguably one of the best scotches I’ve had. Was unpleasantly surprised when my bill came and it was $41.00 though. 

Rate 4.5/5"
