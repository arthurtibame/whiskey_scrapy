4.0,My first barrel strength. I like it. I expected it to burn my face off but it was smooth.

3.5,"Neat.  Different nose off the bat.  Chocolate. Strong leather.  Baking spices.  Cola.  Floral.  It’s an odd combo.  

Been sniffing it for 15 minutes now before the first sip.  It is opening up and the rough edges are smoothing out.  Getting a sugar cookie note as it airs out.  Reminds me of St. Cloud if I were to make a comparison.

Medium to thin texture for a Cask Strength.  Very dark on the tongue.  Brown sugar and cinnamon.  Bubble gum note on the palate that lingers to the finish.  Hint of chocolate and that sugar cookie note.

Not my jam on this one.  It did open up with time but the overall experience just didn’t hit me right tonight.  Could be my palate tonight as the Weller SR earlier didn’t taste quite right either.  I’ll come back to this one for a fair shake in the future."
