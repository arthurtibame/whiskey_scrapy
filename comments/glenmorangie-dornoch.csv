5.0,"Strong taste when drunk neat. Definitely add water, opens it up and makes it very smooth. Delicious with water."

4.0,"(Lot 60135, bottled 15.01.2015) Tasted 6 April 2016.
  Appearance: Light amber / light tea colour. 
  Nose: Not very pungent, rounded, butter caramel (but still rather dry), wood, spices, some fruitcake. Even just a few drops of water seem to literally water down the nose of this whisky. 
  Taste: Fruity, a bit spicy, initially quite dry. Fruitcake, wood tannins. Not very complex. Sweetness arriving in the finish, which is long. With a few drops of water it retains and even increases its wood spiciness and the finish seems less sweet. 
  Overall: Nose and finish are its best features. Add no (or very, very little) water to this one. Overpriced."
