4.25,"Color: White wine

Nose: Pungent peat, with a fruitiness under, pineapple, lemon zest, and cinnamon.

Pallet: Strong ashy taste, burnt sugar, subtle tropical fruit undertones, with oak spice, and white pepper.

Finish: Char, ash, and tropical fruits. Long lasting

Nose 2: Smoke gives away to a stronger pina colada smell, coconut and pineapple dominating.

This is balanced at the extremes. The smoke at first is what is showcased with the fruity flavors hanging in the back. The Pallet then switches from char and ash to sweet and fruity, with the finish having a slight smokiness to it but fruits dominating the finish. After the pallet taste the smoky ash and char to the nose loses the edge of peat and a pina colada is all I can smell. This also drinks well below its proof."
