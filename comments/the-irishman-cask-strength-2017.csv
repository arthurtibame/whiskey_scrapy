null,"This note is actually for the 2015 release, not 2017. This is good stuff. The usual Irish notes are there - vanilla, apple, toasty bread, a bit of jam - but there is an appealing herbal savoriness to the dram, like fresh sage. For a cask strength whiskey, there is hardly any burn to speak of - a bit of a kick, but nothing too harsh. I continue to be impressed by Walsh Whiskey's output - Writer's Tears and The Irishman line have yet to disappoint. It'll be fun to see what they're able to release as their stock continues to age!"
