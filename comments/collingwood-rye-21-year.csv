Added some water ,not much and it drinks smoothly. Smoothness may be due to the lower proof alcohol. Can't wait to try a old fashioned with It."

Saying it has a lot of character is an understatement. 100% rye and 21 years aged, makes this a flavorful combo of a punch in the face from wood followed by the spicy rye notes. Definitely a (good) funky dram."
