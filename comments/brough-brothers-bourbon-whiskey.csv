5.0,Absolutely incredible. Been searching high and low for this product. These gentlemen have absolutely outdone themselves with this. Great flavor. Goes down extremely smooth.  Definitely earned a life long consumer here. Keep up the great work guys!

3.25,"Aged 6 months, sourced by MGP (because it’s distilled in Indiana). 82 proof provides such a smooth mouthfeel that I would recommend this to anyone getting into bourbon. Distillery opening in Louisville sometime in the next month with a new batch coming!"
