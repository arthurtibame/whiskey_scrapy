4.0,Citrus rind. Earthy. A bit muted compared to previous years.

3.5,Very spicy that lingers.
4.5,"N - I’m with the expert, definitely earthy with some orange tones, maybe cherry

P - Very interesting, it’s tangy but in a good way. I agree with the cereal grain and maybe some leather or tobacco. A drop or two of water really makes this thing shine. 

F - Pleasant and smooth, cherry and vanilla finish

First of my btac for 2019 and thoroughly enjoyed this one. It’s got a very unique profile. If you can find it at retail get it all day, secondary pricing I honestly think there’s some better choices out there."
3.75,"Smell- caramel 

Palate: buttery and popcorn and a little bit of caramel

Finish- popcorn

*Free pour at a gig*"

3.0,"Palate: leather and musty

Finish: more must and just general uniqueness

Overall it’s a 3/5 and I’d be disappointed paying above MSRP for it"

4.75,Would give a five but needs more ump for the price! Beautiful whiskey with a wonderful flavor and herbal notes. Finish is weak but very enjoyable dram! Highly recommend!

4.5,"Best rye I've had to date.  Has some spice, but not too much."
3.5,"Kinda sweet, bubblegum on the nose. Morphs into an earthy, medicinal weirdness on the palate. The spice really ramps up too. Finishes with the medicinal and spice.  Very interesting and unique pour. I can't say I'm crazy about this, but I appreciate it's uniqueness. Nothing like it that I've had."
4.0,"Apple pie, baking spices, and tons of spearmint"

1.0,"Solid nose, fresh... at first. It then morphs into weirdness. Weirdness on the palate as well - strange, tastes like the smell of a house of cats (used kitty litter?) infused with five-spice. What happened. 12/6/19 
The more I think about this, the more I think something went horribly wrong for the 2019 batch. This should not have been bottled. Its undrinkable for me. Usually one of my favorites."
4.25,"For my 150th tasting, I’m happy to finally get to try this one. I have the regular Sazerac Rye (baby Saz), which is the same mashbill as this one, just a much lower proof (90 proof). Let’s check out this 6 year old 125.7 proof version of Buffalo Trace’s rye mashbill.

The nose has rich baking spices (especially cinnamon and clove) that pop out, followed by caramel, freshly baked bread, light leather, toasted marshmallows, and cooked red apples.
Not a ton of rye specific spice coming out in the nose, just the tiniest bit.
After the first sip, further nosing bring out this very strange cardboard box note, very weird.

The palate is semi-sweet has a rich oily mouthfeel. The rye spice defiantly comes out here along with vanilla, apples, caramel and leather. 
On later tastings, that cardboard box note I got in the nose becomes present, but like a slightly sour cardboard box. Weird.

The finish tingles in the tip and front sides of the tongue with rye and vanilla hanging out for a bit with a slight bitterness on the back end.

I really like this one. But that obscure cardboard box note that didn’t become present until after the 1st sip or so is boggling my mind. It doesn’t ruin it for me, but it is very odd and something I’ve never experienced."

5.0,"Fortunate enough to have a 2oz pour of this with some good friends who know A LOT about bourbon and know a lot of people in the industry. When seeing the 2019 I was told this was one of the best years besides the 2014 so he had to buy me a pour. For reference my friend  has almost every year of all the BTAC’s in his home bar along with every other “unicorn” you can think of. This was my first foray into the BTAC and I honestly don’t think I’ll ever have a rye as good as this again. 
The first sip was absolutely HEAVEN! Sweet candy-like with no burn. Spicy rye sits on the palette for quite some time before making me want to go back for more. I don’t how it’s possible to make a whiskey with this proof taste so good. I will most likely never see a bottle of this for retail but if I did I’d buy it in a second. As much as I loved this whiskey, it has ruined all other ryes for me."

4.5,"Delicious.  Wish I had not tried this as I can not find it in my price range.  Warming hot flavor but yet not like an alcohol burn, a nice heat.  Will be longing for this bottle."
4.5,"N: Carmel and vanilla
P: Butterscotch and dill
F: Burnt brown sugar that lingers"
4.75,"Like its bourbon brethren, this has a very warm mouthfeel right away and goes down like butter that lingers. The nose is almost zesty with citrus-spice that maintains through the taste and finishes with a little bite"

3.0,"A little peaty and fruity on the nose. Burns my eyes when I bring the glass up and finishes hot. Very oaky. 

Added one drop of water. Opens up nicely. Still finishes hot, but you get some of the stone fruity flavors."
4.25,Lots of spice very nice warmth
5.0,Smells super hot but so smooth
4.75,"Nose- caramel, maple syrup, cardamom, dark chocolate, rye spice, polished leather, cinnamon buns

Palate- Maple syrup, caramel, dill, wood spice, cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, herbal-vegetal note right before the finish 

Finish- Long, drying and chewy finish with notes of rye spice, caramel, and cinnamon 


This is the definition complex. So. Many. Notes. Both on nose and palate I get countless smells and flavors that would be too long to list. THH is impressive as ever for me due to the color, complexity, and overall deliciousness from less than 7 years of aging. 2019 in particular is my favorite that ive tried of the batch"
2.0,"A double from the White House in Aspen

Very sweet on the nose (in a pleasant way).
Totally unique. My first impression is a dryness on the lips. Long pleasant burn after finish, retaining a dry filmy feeling on the roof of my mouth. It’s flat across the pallet, with the primary flavor being white grapes on the back of the pallet. There are hints of woody, spicy, rye flavor too. If I chew it I get the Carmel flavor I like from higher proof bourbons, but it’s accompanied by some bitterness. Overall, I’m glad I tried it, but won’t do it again."
