4.0,"Fruity and woody on the nose. Very oak forward, I like the distinct Ozark oak flavor along with tannins, nuttiness, dark chocolate, and cloves. The finish is a very smooth balance of sweet and tannic flavors."

4.25,"Lukter karamell, eple, lim, vanilje. Kompleks som helsike (men nå har jeg også smakt 5 whiskey før dette). dessertvin-preg. smaken forsterkes etter en slurk. sterk."

2.5,"Fruity on the nose. Some malt as well. Tastes young, but not harsh. Smooths out towards the end, velvety. The young note holds this back. 2/1/19"

5.0,One of the most unique tasting experiences I’ve had: nutty and oaky (go figure) with a hint of chocolate.
