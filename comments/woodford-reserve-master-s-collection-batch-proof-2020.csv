5.0,"This is a top notch bourbon in all aspects and I don’t agree with the negatives that I’ve been seeing this get (almost all are completely based on price and not the whiskey). I think most people who appreciate bourbon can agree that regular Woodford reserve is one of the most quintessential bourbons out there. Ever since I first tried Woodford, I wanted to know what the barrel proof would taste like and I finally got my answer. This is a much more rich bourbon than the regular Woodford with all the same notes. It has an oily consistency that coats the palate extremely well and provides a smooth and lasting finish. I get brown butter, brown sugar, and maple syrup up front. I get a big cherry bomb on the mid palate with a nice spicy oak finish that sticks with you. I don’t believe bringing this up along with the double oaked does either bourbon justice as they are not even remotely trying to come across as the same bourbon. Also, I believe it’s extremely important to not let price affect a review and just judge the whiskey based on the whiskey itself. All things considered, this taste very much like a top shelf bourbon. It’s complex, highly drinkable, and all around a unique experience. I paid MSRP and don’t regret it in the slightest. After all, the best whiskey is the whiskey you like the way you like to drink it."
4.75,"Flavors are bold, balanced and complex. It has the sweetness, spiciness, oakiness, a hint of smokiness and they all work well and are helped by the high proof. Finish is good but some flavors fall off."
4.5,The nose is awesome and explodes out of the glass. The palate matches with bold and complex sweetness almost resembling the double oaked. A mild spiciness balances it. The finish is good but a little disappointing. Overall an absolutely delicious bourbon.

1.75,"If a distiller doesn't bother to water down a whisky, is it on steroids? The quick and simple answer is no...it's the same whisky just without water. Sometimes this comes with non chill filtration which DOES give it a steroid like effect. Sometimes they pick honey barrels which does that tool. Or with ECBP you get older whisky. 

Woodford has elected to be woodford with less water, a fancy bottle, and a 100 dollar markup.  Before we get to the whisky, warning. DO NOT ADD WATER!

Nose - its' woodford. That dark chocolate, brown sugar, sweet and completely unrefined and entry level bourbon. Great brown foreman notes with a lesser expression of them behind it. A consistent as they come kinda of feel showing a great level of quality assurance, a big corporate feel, and yet an exceptional master distillery and blender involved to make this work. I can't express how much this smells like a higher proof woodford and just that. 

Taste - Here we deviate a bit in that the youth and unrefined nature of woodford comes out here and you can tell you're drinking spirit forward and younger whisky. You can tell they didn't take the time to find anything but regular woodford barrels for this. Sweet, chocolate, a touch of bannana, a bit of a dr pepper like note, and overall like woodford a good bourbon for us sweet lovers. The alcohol is harsh and over the top. I tried water and even a drop washes this away, the chill filtration just ruins the CS effort. 

I try and score whisky for what's in the glass and not more than that, but this one begs me to comment on the price and frankly the disgusting and just horrible choice for what I firmly believe is a chill filtered product, but I'll try and avoid that. 

Woodford is a highly enjoyable bourbon and I'm a huge fan of the double oaked. This is far inferior to the double oaked, it's not remotely close to that league. Instead this is the most boring and dull over the top high proof bourbon I've ever had. But it's got great bones for a young bourbon.  1.75 and I'm sure that's too high but I like woodford and I like higher proof. Even when it's ruined by stupid. 

The real shame is this just showcases what could happen if they aged this longer, picked honey barrels, and didn't chill filter. Woodford could put out not a world class bourbon but a world class whisky that could rival anyone. Instead that settle for mediocrity."

4.5,Damn this is good. Great nose of baking pies fruit and pastry with a bit of a bourbon bite on the end.
4.5,"Big punching bourbon with loads of flavor. Essentially woodford reserve on steroids in the flavor profile with more apple, caramel, oak, and slight cinnamon coming through. A bit pricey for what I paid but if you like woodford bourbon this is a good investment for the collection."
