4.0,"This is a great expression. PX comes out in the taste along with the oak. Fresh sweet fruit on the nose , vanilla on the nose and taste. Full body smooth with some bite in the middle then rounds and lingers in the end. Going to enjoy this bottle. I would definitely replace this when finished great value."
