4.0,Lemongrass and mint are big players early on with a buttery feel on the palate. The higher proof is well hidden with some sweetness in the middle. The spice of the rye doesn't come on until late with a medium length finish

4.25,"Lemon and spice. Oily mouthfeel with a great sweetness. At 114 this is smooth and delicious!!!!
Drinking straight will try with ice or water soon"
3.75,Very bright and youthful. At barrel proof it definitely packs a punch but a splash of water brings out the sweetness which mellows it out. Awesome stuff for cocktails!

4.25,"Intense barrel sugars on the nose.
Beautiful dark amber color.
Fatty mouthfeel followed immediately by fiery proof. No hiding the barrel strength.
Balanced rye character on par with Woodford Rye."
3.75,"November 2019 Wilbur's FC.
Tastes like barrel proof Bullet Rye.
Best with a couple drops of water."

4.25,"Got the last bottle at specs for $38. Most rye drinkers are familiar with MGP 95/5 mashbill as its the source for many popular brands. What sets this one apart is the 114.6 proof , natural color and non-chill filtered creating a robust oily whiskey. Poured neat, nose is menthol, clove, ginger, tea leaves, tobacco and a hint of maple. Its a very rich herbal experience. What im not getting is ethanol or the trademark dill note, maybe it will come in time. Palate is punch in the face of aggressive rye spice, strong peppery heat, more menthol and clove balanced with Terry's chocolate orange and honey sweetness. Mouthfeel is thick and clingy coating with flavor that rushes in like the Ride of The Valkyries and lingers. Finish is all day with chocolate orange, rye and clove spice leading to barrel oak, heavy char and fading menthol. This is legit rye. You know how the cask strength bourbons are richer and full of flavor well I guess same holds true for rye. Make no mistake , smooth this is not. We're talking grown mans rye not for beginners.This is a powerhouse whiskey that I highly recommend to experienced drinkers if you can find it..........92/100..........completely different profile than Pikesville but almost as enjoyable as a pure high %rye...........update: I pick up the dill after glass rests for a while but its shrouded in all the other notes"

3.25,Nose is total shite. Pure ethanol. Once you get past that it’s fairly decent. Age is “over 3 years”. It shows. Not much characteristically speaking. I’ve had worse but I’ve also had much better.
1.5,"Nose is an acrostic lemongrass note not unlike a household cleaner with a bit of pie crust, yeast extract, blackboard chalk, and herbs. The palate burns with acetone, cleaner, sharp pepper, and cumin. It's exceedingly green and makes you pay for it with each sip. Dill and additional herbs are in the finish. Finish is quite long but I want it to end."
