4.25,"Keepers of the Quaich is a Scottish society, or a special club if you like, where only people who have spread the whisky culture can get in. A quaich is actually a gaelic cup, made out of metal, used in formal events as a welcome or goodbye gift to visitors. 

The Keepers of the Quaich take themselves seriously, they even have a magazine and their own whisky limited editions. Since i had the opportunity to be at Chivas Regal spiritual home, i had the awesome chance to taste one of them, obviously the Strathisla Keepers of the Quiach whisky. 

Bottled at 59.4% amber color.

On the nose: Hay. Dry grass. Heather. Orkney earthy peat, orange peel. 

On the palate it is very bitter and very spicy. A good way to describe it is that there is an Orange mixed with toffee with an overall bitter sweetness under the powerful strength of this dram.

Aftertaste is the best part. Chocolate very refined and some saltiness. 

Overall this wasn't the greatest dram on earth, but it sure is a very limited one. My score for it is 81 over 100."
