3.0,"Would give it 3.5 if I could. Nose is bourbon-y sweet - almost verging on corny - if not for the abundance of rasins (more than any scotch I've ever had).

On the palette, it goes straight to the back bid your cheeks, just like the Abundah, but with a notable lack of sherry for a Speyside.

Would definitely buy again."

3.0,"Nose - Lightly spiced malt, freshly cut fruity wood, hints of a spiced apple juice that was made with pressed peels and cores.
Taste - Lightly spiced malt on the tongue, white pepper heat, lightly bitter apple juice that was made w/ stems/peels/seeds, lightly drying yet creamy mouthfeel, tiny hint of vanilla.
Finish - Lingering white pepper spice but quickly fades, lightly oaked apple juice sweetness lingers, whisp of vanilla.
Score - 74/100
Final Thoughts - It's a very inoffensive blend. Leads me to believe that it's been aged in primarily former bourbon barrels or at the very least non sherry/port. Not really any offensive characteristics other than the lightly bitter apple juice vibe I get from this. It's kind of boring but inoffensive. Factoring in the price, it'd be an easy pass for me seeing as I can get Monkey Shoulder for a fraction of the price for pretty much the same thing if not better."

4.0,"This is a VERY GOOD blend, and typical highlander. 

Some sherry on the nose, with dried fruit and baking spices. There's also a certain je-ne-sais-quoi nuttiness that creates balance to the overall flavour. Quite balanced."

4.0,A complex blend. Drink it slowly and you'll get shifts in flavor from sip to sip.

4.0,"Nose: fruit cake, clove, cinnamon, faint oak, stewed plums, lemon curd, milk chocolate, pepper

Taste: extremely dense fig, heavy pepper finish. Dry and sour. Lemon zest. Light malt. Dense dry walnuts. Orange zest, parsley, baking spices, red wine, graphite, underripe peaches or pear. 

Water subdues all the fruit notes and brings maple syrup and powdered sugar. Finish is still long and dry with heavy red wine notes,"
4.0,Excellent peaty taste for a blend.

4.0,"A fine blend.  Friendly enough for beginners, interesting enough for the more experienced, and a pretty good representation for “Speyside flavors.”  And who cannot buy a bottle with a dog named Scallywag on it?

Malty and fruity on the nose.  A light sherry on the palate with delightful hits of spice, and a surprisingly hefty mouthfeel.  Thank you Mortlach.  The finish has a slightest hint of smoke and is well balanced.  With time in the glass, this becomes more and more chocolaty.  This does not need water.  The Macallan is evident in here, and this makes me want to do my own blend with only Mac 12 and an older Mortlach.

Anyways, I am impressed so far.  This is the first Douglas Laing blend I’ve purchased.  No regrets, and I will be trying the Rock Oyster soon.

PRESUMPTIVE MARK: 84/100"
5.0,"Tried this at the whisky extravaganza. Gotta give props to Douglas Lainge for blending in Macallan, Glenrothes, and Mortlach to get a very good expression with sherried fruit, spices, and nutiness."

4.0,"When most people think about quality blended scotch they instantly think Compass Box, and rightfully so, but Douglas Laing is also putting together some great stuff as well. Here we have Scallywag, a malt blend using only Speyside single malts, namely Macallan, Mortlach and Glenrothes (any others are not named specifically). Matured in both sherry and bourbon casks, bottled at 46% ABV, chill filtered and most likely has colorant added making it an amber gold.  I can confirm that it is chill filtered because I made my wife a whisky and water with it (about a 5:1 water to whisky ratio and 2 ice cubes) and even after 20 minutes it remained clear as apple juice. 

The nose is full on sherry but not overly so, very Macallan-like or a more intense Famous Grouse. Red grapes, raisins and figs. Sherry oak, wood smoke (but not peat). Vanilla, semisweet chocolate, lots of fruitcake. Tobacco, leather, salty, raspberry chocolate. Definite signs of both well aged and youthful stock. After a little time the Mortlach worm tub profile starts to take form with those meaty/mineral notes. The Glenrothes components come in as well with a more honeyed profile. Honeysuckle, plums, melon rinds and dried apricots. Brown sugar, toffee, caramel and a malty biscuit note at the bottom of the glass. 

The palate is sweet sherry and lots of spices, but not too spicy. Very light peat and wood smoke. Dark chocolate, tobacco and leather. Vanilla, allspice and pepper. It’s all Macallan at first, then more of a Glenrothes feel with a pop of citrus peel, stone fruits and honey, oak and biscuits. More of that Mortlach meaty/mineral funk from the nose. Cinnamon, nutmeg and lots of fruitcake. 

A medium bodied mouthfeel that is a bit thin and creamy. Mouthwatering 
The finish is long with sweet sherry, baking spices, fruitcake and dry. 

When I first opened this blend I was not impressed. It seemed overly spicy for 46% and the Mortlach profile was too strong. There are only a handful of distilleries that use worm tubs that I actually like, Talisker, Edradour, Oban, Old Pulteney, Springbank to a lesser extent but they are growing on me, so that funk was just too much. It reminded me too much of Craigellachie which I am really not a fan of. The first half of the bottle was used for trading samples and once they were poured I let it sit a few months. Going back to it, things really improved. As I made my way towards the end of the bottle it really became a very solid dram. If you are a big Mortlach or Sprinkgbank fan and like sherried scotches then I would highly recommend this one, but I would say to work through it more quickly to maintain that profile. At $70 the price is a bit high, but I would say it still is worth it. A solid 4
Cheers"

3.5,"Speyside from a different angle, a vatted malt combining some well-known names, created by an independent bottler.

I found this a bit of a roller-coaster flavour ride but overall more good than bad.

So... The nose. Sherry, sweet but not unctuous, not quite harsh but the alcohol and toasted barrel kick is moderated by cinnamon and toffee. The mouth... Toasty, touch of malt. Spices, hot and sweet at the fore. More toffee. Caramel at the back of the mouth. The char is not hiding, adding a bitter note. There are a lot of tastes here but balanced is not necessarily how I'd describe it; this is almost a creature of extremes. Aftertaste... That bitter touch and a wash of sherry have a battle but there are no casualties.

Scallywag is not the least bit shy. It has the energy of the cute doggo whose image it identifies itself with. In fact, it is noisy and a touch excitable but likeable if not loveable. Despite limitations , this drinks well."
3.25,"Nose: sweet, fruits (orange zest), warming spices.
Palate: first very light, then intense swet spices.
Aftertaste: sweet spices, faint bitterness, mouth covering. Lingering for long."
4.5,"Third stop on Douglas Laing core expressions, another beautiful bottle: SCALLYWAG, that has a dog similar to the one on ""Monopoly"" in the label. This time is a Speyside blended malt, made primarly from Macallan, Glenrothes and Mortlach. 

Bottled at 46%abv.

On the nose, amazing: Salt. Smoky, cigarrettes; Dry cake as in all of these douglas Laing expressions; Lemon and Orange candy. 

On the palate, Caramel, Honey, dim Spicyness. So fancy, well made, very Smooth. Tobbacco notes also present.

Finish allspice notes, very pleasant and smooth.

Overall this beats the ""timorous beastie"" by 1 point, 93 over a 100. Great dram."
