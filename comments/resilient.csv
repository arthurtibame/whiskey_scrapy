4.25,This bourbon has two very distinct characteristics. At first taste you will notice the charred oak followed by a leather and tobacco finish. Very good with a complex taste.

3.0,"Very very very oaky, smooth for the finish, but at 126 proof has a lot of burn. On the rock or rocks recommended to smooth out the burn. Expected a smoother bourbon for $100 price tag."
4.5,One of my favorite bourbons so far! Looking forward to more from Resilient!

4.5,Lots of peanuts with vanilla/oak goodness.  Definitely tastes like it was sourced from George Dickel.
