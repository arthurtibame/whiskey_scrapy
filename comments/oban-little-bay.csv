3.0,"Good dram. The nose is basic and doesn't represent the taste well, in my opinion. Definitely taste the citrus, and toffee, and a hint of salted caramel. There is a distinct alcohol harshness as one would expect from a NAS scotch, but it works in this ones favor, and actually is better than most other young NAS scotches I've tried. Very very light peat, almost unnoticeable. I love salty notes so this was very likable for me. 
  
  I toured the Oban distillery when I was in Scotland and I prefer this over the 14, which If I recall correctly had more of an alcohol burn and overall tasted a bit one dimensional. Better than the distillers edition as well, which because of it's sherry finish was smoother but also very flat. Most people prefer the 14 to the Little Bay, but I agree with the staff review that this is far better."

3.0,"I'm not sure if I found the nose complex or just too much happening at once.  Aromas of everything from peaches to maple to apples.  Taste is about the same---just too much happening, and to some extent losing the classic Oban profile.  Between this and the 14, I'd choose the 14. Especially considering the minimal price difference. Update 3/18:  I had this as a sample, this time with some ice.  Better than neat, but still prefer the 14.  Thanks to Ryan for the sample!"

4.0,"The staff review is pretty accurate for Oban Little Bay. I was never a big fan of Oban 14, but I'm really enjoying this one. As I'm not a purist, I generally like well made NAS whisky for the youthful kick, and this is no exception. This is a relatively gentle highland malt with a good mix of fruit and spices. The finish is medium length with oak and salt at the end. At 43% add only a couple drops of water. Would be better non-chill filtered and natural color."
4.0,"Okay, my first sample from the Scotland Distillery Trade group is officially in the books.  This one was graciously supplied by my friend Ryan.  It's 43% alcohol, non-chill filtered but I believe there is color added to this NAS offering.  This bottle runs just north of $50 and is a steal IMO.

One funny thing I feel like pointing out first, though, is the name.  Apparently Oban translates to ""little bay"" in Gaelic.  So, in essence, this could've been called Oban Oban.  I just found that a bit funny.  Moving on.

I had the pleasure of trying this beside a sample of the Oban 18 year old just to see if the bloodlines run connected.  That was were I made a startling discovery- but more on that later...

The nose is beautifully complex:  toffee, extra sweet honey, peaches and a hearty oak presence.  They all swirl around wonderfully in the glass.  I'm liking where this is heading.

The palate is loaded (like the 18yo) with crisp, green apples, juicy apricots and pears all in front of a backdrop of lively, young oak.  It's just peppery enough to keep the sweetness in check.  This all just works so well together and fades into an incredible finish.  It's got a tropical feel to it at first, as all the orchard fruits fall away, but it finishes long, spicy and a tad bit syrupy.

This is where I was taken by surprise- the Little Bay and the 18yo look identical, smell very similar and actually have a very close flavor profile.  The Little Bay is a bit more lively due to the smaller, ex-bourbon casks used.  The exposure to those barrels really adds a kick to an already excellent dram.

So, while this was an excellent way to kick off my journey with my new trading group, I'm disappointed in the fact that Little Bay overshadows its bigger, older brothers (the 14 & 18 year olds).  If you factor in the price it's even more of a shock to me.

Overall, if you guys are in the market for an Oban bottle, pony up the extra $5-6 over the 14yo and pocket the $65-70 savings from the 18yo, and drink the best of the trio- the Oban Oban.  Trust me, this is a no brainer.  This is a perfect example of bigger not always being better.  Cheers, my friends."

4.0,"Let's get this off my chest to begin: I think Oban is a little overrated. People act like the best hooch in the galaxy comes off the stills there, and while I genuinely enjoy their whisky...I mean, c'mon. It's good, but not the mother of all whiskies. The Little Bay NAS, regardless of distillery reputation, is pretty darn tasty, however. The nose is pure fruit salad - honey, mint, apple, pear, a little something salty, a little squeeze of citrus. That's a pretty good picture of what you find on the palate, as well, opening sweet and fruity, then gradually ending with sea spray and lemon. The finish isn't particularly long, lingering, or complex, but it's a fine, easy sipper of a dram. I think the price tag I've seen for a bottle of this is obscene (Oban, in any stripe, is NOT a top-shelf, empty-my-wallet-to-get-some bottle), but I most certainly would not turn down a dram if it were offered to me."

3.0,"Finishing my last two episodes of ""Billions"" since the Mets are faltering against the Brewers wanting to enjoy my pour of this Oban, thanks to Ryan from SDT group.  Oban 14 has not really struck with me and has this reputation that precedes it and sometimes I find myself wondering what others are getting from it.  Maybe this is the one?

The nose is faint.  Citrus orange peel is the primary note.  Confectionary sugar sweetens the nose.  Apricot and honey with a touch of maritime sea salt all nicely detectable.  The orange citrus, over time, transforms to orange creamsicle as the bitter peel is insfused with the sweeter aromas.  Working towards the palate, the initial draw is bittersweet: unripened apples with caramel blend providing this sensation.  Wood tannins, vanilla, honey all blend together keeping that bittersweet sensation.  Give it time, and the sweetness strenthens and is much improved.  Finally, the finish is long yet not terribly dynamic leaving the palate filled with orange bitters, drying oak and cloves.

A fine malt, but once again, for me, falls a bit short of being exceptional.  Don't get me wrong, the aromas, the flavors and the finish are enjoyable and the ying-yang of bitter to sweet has a nice play with a slight sophistication.  A dram that is worth seeking out.  Oban may have a following and a name and other seem to connect.  But my connection/experience to it, like with Oban 14 (and another brand, Glenmorangie), is not on the same plane.  [Dry Glass: Cracker Jacks][85/100][Tasted: 5/15/17]"

3.5,"Scotland, September 2017. (from notes).

Nose: A lighter and more interesting nose than the Oban 14 year or Distillers Edition expressions – almost floral with apricots, peaches and honey plus a hint of brine in the background.

Palate: Fruity ginger with light tannic spices, softened by orange and berry flavours. Very drinkable but there is a bit of caramel that almost takes things in a syrupy direction … but not quite.

Finish: Longer finish than the 14 year, dry and with a touch of spice. Adding water emphasizes the spicy character on both the nose and palate.

All in all a nicely balanced whisky and generally superior to the 14 year old. I agree with the ""official"" tasting notes, but not with the rating - 91 seems too high.

“Good” : 3.5 stars"

3.0,"Back at my new local whisky bar to celebrate passing my Prince2 exam...wohoo!  Usually I'm not a fan of trying whiskies in bars as you never know how long the bottle has been opened. However as the bar itself has only been opened 3 months most bottles should be optimal for tasting which so far has proved right. So enough of the preamble... what's the whisky like? I liked the 14 and nudged it up to a 4 once value was taken into account, this one...is good but nothing really excites me or stands out about it. I miss the more viscous smokiness of the 14. It's a 30% price premium to the 14 as well. The final nail in the scoring coffin was I tried Springbank 15 (similar price) immediately after which was really good so once i did the comparison this gets a 3.4 rounding down to a 3."

4.0,"Stop number 15 on the SDT is Oban. Oban is a Highland distillery but they fancy themselves as a ""western highland coastal distillery"". Little Bay is a NAS expression that weighs in at 43% ABV and as far as I know it is chill filtered and has colorant added. The color is an orange gold. Oban is Gaelic for ""little bay"". So this is my review of Little Bay from Little Bay. 

The nose is ripe with oranges, clementines, apricots and tangerines. Bright and citrusy. Dried mango and fresh cantaloupe. Lemon peel and honey. Basically it's a liquid fruit bowl. Raisins and dates show up a while later. A little malty with light oak and vanilla cream. After about 5 seconds of nosing this whisky I immediately likened it to the Cragganmore 12 year old I reviewed a few weeks ago. Incredibly similar but the Oban has a stronger orange note. 

The palate mimics the nose. Lots of orange and tangerine. Very light pepper and almost no oak presence. It's sweet but not sticky sweet, just enough to satisfy your sweet tooth. Again this is a similar profile to the Cragganmore. 

Medium bodied mouthfeel that is a little oily but turns dry. The finish is medium short, dry and fruity with a little bitterness. 

This was my first from Oban so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I did know most people got the strong orange notes. I'm happy with it, it's a great scotch for people who might not be too keen on scotch. Fairly light, fruity, and easy to drink. Good for the scotch snob too. Enough complexity to keep you coming back for more. I have to say though, the Cragganmore is nearly as good and can be purchased at a lower price. Tough call, I'd grab either one depending on the status of my wallet. Thanks to Ryan for the sample. 

This review ends round one of the Scotch Distillery Tour. Round two starts in about 6 weeks. Can't wait!"

I really felt that the Oban 14 respectfully (so many swear by this) falls short in many ways but this really is a NAS that lives up.

Nose: Malty sweetness, caramel, and sea air, and a touch of orange zest. No real harshness, but not complex. Nosing it a bit more I get a vivid image of fresh saltwater taffy being stretched.

Pallet: The youth shows, as the first bit is harsh, mellows a bit with some nice oak notes, and then white pepper spice builds.

Finish: Off note of bitter varnish and oak... this is not pleasing at all... a bit of dark chocolate surfaces at the tail end.

The nose writes a check that the pallet and finish could not cash... Not sure if it is how long the bottle has been opened, or if my pallet has changed drastically, or if the fudge changed something, but I remember this being better..."

4.0,"The Oban Little Bay is a very smooth and approachable dram.  There is a lot of stewed fruit or for the Mennonites out there Obst Mousse on the nose hailing largely from the sherry influence.  There is a sweet viscosity on the palate as well which enhances the smoothness of the dram.  There is a lengthy finish with hints of apricot and prune that is quite enjoyable.  This is a great scotch for those looking to start drinking scotch as it is very well balanced and easy to drink.  However, it is still an interesting scotch and a nice change of pace from the heavy Islay peat bombs for the experienced scotch drinker."

4.0,"Today's review is of the Oban Little Bay single malt whisky. As you may know, Oban is Gaelic for ""Little Bay"", so this is the Little Bay Little Bay. It's a NAS single malt that apparently takes Oban small batches and finishes them in smaller oak casks. It's bottled at 43% ABV and does alright at that level, though a little more ABV and a little less chill filtration would be appreciated. I picked this up for $39 and was happy to be able to try something new at that price. Thoughts and rating below: ⠀
⠀
🥃 Oban Little Bay - 43% ABV
⠀
Nose: Fruity, jammy, bubblegum, seasalt taffy, some smoke, a little maltiness, ⠀
⠀
Taste: This whisky has a nice tropical fruit flavor - maybe toasted coconut and grilled pineapple. Equally present is a roasted smokiness. During my firsting, I thought of roasted peanuts, but it's not quite that oily or salty. Maybe more of a toasted pecans thing. Hints of salt, young barley, and floral notes poke out here and there and make for a complex whisky. It's also got a bit of a perfumed black tea thing going on. There is some noticeable heat and the tasting ends with drier fruity notes and get a little peppery.  Many flavors, but not necessarily all harmonius.
⠀
The mouthfeel is light and the finish is pretty short. The dry coconut and pepper notes fade away into kind of a delicate sweet floral nothingness.
⠀
I think that this whisky's weakest aspect is its finish, but it's certainly interesting and stands out as unique compared to others Highlands and Island whiskys I've tried. Somewhere in between a sherried speyside and a smoky coastal highland. I think a little oxidation has improved this from last time. It's very drinkable. I'm not sure if I would buy it again even for the $39 i got it for, but that's mostly just because I like to try new things!

2.25,"Nose of apricot and processed sugar syrup

Quick, dry finish. Hint of maple and oak.

Overall straight forward, not a whole lot of depth"
4.25,Very good! Has a softness that I’ve only experienced with Macallan. A light peat/smoke with a kiss of salinity. Honey is the star standout though! Found this sweet baby for only $29 at Costco!

4.0,"Purchased for $35 in MA, great buy! Nose is smooth malt and sweet fruits with honey. Orange and fig balanced with barrel wood. Palate is strong dose of oranges, honey, rich malt and more oak. The finish is dry wood and fleeting malt with fruit. Its really a refined scotch. Wish I had more time to ponder over and refine my tasting notes but this bottle went quick due to circumstances along with the Lap select. Overall I really enjoyed the citrus notes and good malt presence. Its a little too oaky dry for my elite upper rankings but is still top notch imo.....91/100"

3.5,"Nose is tangy with subtle sweetness. No peat and very unassuming. The first taste is Slightly peaty up front. Sea salt and candied pears with a sweet and tangy sort of fresh bread finish. Very light and smooth. Finish doesn't last long. Subsequent tastes will feel buttery on the front end.

This is a very good drink. Offers something for everyone and would be a good introduction for someone who might have started their scotch obsession with Johnny Walker Black and might be looking for something a little more balanced and delicate."
4.75,"Oban is Gaelic for ""little bay"" so apparently this scotch is named Little Bay Little Bay. But that's not necessarily a bad thing, it worked out well for the Ferrari LaFerrari.

The nose includes sweet fruit, orange peel, smoke, butterscotch, and flowers.

The palate is a rich balance between sweet fruits & flowers and smoke & peat, before finishing with some medicinal notes, sea water, and pepper. It takes a few sips to get a feel for this complex whisky.

This whisky is difficult to figure out at first. It's not quite a sweet highlands scotch, but it's also not a smokey islands malt. Ultimately, I think Oban strikes a great balance between the two and the longer you sit with it the more flavors you will keep finding."

4.75,"Nose:  Warm heather honey, sun-bleached grass, a bit of seashell, and a hint of pear.  More fresh fruit, like berries and cream. A hint of orange hides in there as well, along with a little brine.  I can pick up some oak and cinnamon spice at the back there.

Palate:  Oily and sweet.  Green grass, coconut/strawberry/peach taffies, a hint of warm peat.  Once I picked it up on the nose, I could finally put a name to it: ""berries and cream"".  The peat there is almost a light, heathery, floral peat (almost cardamom-like) that I love.  Definitely some shortbread cookie in there too.  Earl grey tea and white pepper send it off.

Finish:  Long and sweet.  The note that lingers reminds me of fruity saltwater taffy - like a somewhat dull tropical flavor without overwhelming sweetness.  Sweet, buttery shortbread and that white pepper carry through as well.  That bit of bergamot is definitely apparent once the hardier flavors pass.

Conclusion:  Wow! I was not expecting the explosion of fruit and flowers!  I have a soft spot for Oban 14, but this absolutely blows that out of the water with layer after layer of fruit, cream, flowers, vanilla - like a whiskey parfait!  For the price I paid, it would be hard to think of a better deal.  Just enough peat without being overpowering, just enough fruity sweetness without being cloying, and bursting with a prairie of flowers."
4.0,"Only other Oban expression I have had before was Oban 14 and I liked it a lot. The only thing that disappointed me was that i didn’t consider it too complex on flavors. Little Bay however, is the exact opposite. Both the nose and taste are deeply saturated in seemingly dozens of flavors. 

Nose: dried candied apricots, overripe apples, baking spices such as clove and star anise, sweet butter cream, and all rounded off by what I can only describe as a fresh baked and stuffed cannoli. 

Taste: slight ashy smokiness which is pleasant, candied fruits such as plums, apples, pineapple, and raisins, granulated cane sugar. Mid pallet fades into a silky milk chocolate and transitions on the end to those same baking spices I found on the nose. 

So glad I found this bottle before Fall. Once the temperatures go down this whiskey is going to be perfect for sitting next to a bonfire, or fire place after a good hearty meal."

4.0,Very mellow
4.25,"Nose: pear, sea air with a hint of smoke, vegetal - maybe asparagus
Taste: predominant word that comes to mind is “bright” as there’s a refreshing feel to it but not as much citrus as that might imply - there’s a little lemon but like if you gave a quick squeeze of lemon over asparagus before serving, a light honey, salty, a tinge of smoke late, flowers?
Finish: apple jolly rancher - not that level of sweetness but that flavor versus a real apple, briny, that flowery note lingers as well
After reading reviews: the nose and taste notes from Distiller make sense for me except confectioner sugar on the nose (and Flaviar’s cake) - this was much fruitier than sweet for me, I don’t get the spice notes on the finish though, Flaviar notes carrots so there’s the vegetal note that stuck out to me.  Overall, this is nice and complex.  I prefer the higher levels of both peat and sweet in Oban 14, however.  When this was priced in the $30s, it was a great value but not as much in the $50s now."

Floral slight fruit tones with a finish that’s a bit  longer than it should be. Had an ethanol aftertaste. Still a nice scotch. I enjoyed it for a pour. Would be worth another try for a $30 bottle.  Enjoyed the pour with my good buddy Steve.

On the nose it is a little straight forward, salt,  Beach, Tobbacco, Acid grapes,Slight peat and Pear juice.

On the palate is balanced and delicious: Oak, Spices, Oranges, Hints of peat, Clove very Salty. Finish is long and rewarding, with ashes.

Overall this beauty is a 96 over 100, points deducted on the nose but it is one of the greatest. Absolutely recommended. Slaintè!!!"

3.75,"Color: Golden Nectar (just a hint darker than Oban 14), thin long streaky legs - slightly oily

Nose: Butterscotch, Fig Newtons (a medley of the bread and sweet fig paste), Citrus - but not the same sharp citrus as the 14. An overall sweeter, but less complex nose.

Taste: Initial mildly sweet oily mouthfeel. A bitter bite (Cloves? Soap?) is present that cuts that initial sweetness. Bubbly citrus along with hints of vanilla and caramel. A touch of spice rounds out the palate.

Finish: Along with the typical caramel sweetness that lingers on the tongue, the bitter note presents itself like a Grapefruit rind - almost neutralizing the palate and drying the mouth.

Overall: This offering from Oban isn’t as sweet, and is more bitter than the 14. I enjoy the nose, and the bitterness is a nice changeup, but would rather spend the extra ~$15 for what I consider to be a much better dram.

4.0,"Oban Little Bay. Translates to Little Bay Little Bay. This is Oban's NAS ""budget"" offering. I'll call it a budget offering, but the reality is that this leagues better than most single malts relegated to this category. Let's get into it.

Nose: Honey, floral, and fruity. Lots of honeydew, pear, green apple, apricot, and orange. Plenty of toffee and malt. Touch of brown sugar. Some walnut and almond, and a touch of plum. Another sweet note that I can't quite place. Akin to jelly. Really no salinity or smoke. A touch of oak and a complete absence of ethanol. Extremely pleasant and approachable, yet also full.

Palate: Kicks things up a notch from the nose. The walnut and roasted almond come in strong. Now there's a bit of salt, but it's table salt instead of the expected sea salt. Still very floral. Caramel, vanilla, milk chocolate, brown sugar, and graham cracker. Still plenty of orange, pear, apple, apricot, and honeydew. Clove, nutmeg, and oak provide spice. Very nice, dangerously drinkable.

Finish: Vanilla and milk chocolate. Orange and apricot. Clove, nutmeg, cinnamon and oak add more spice. Still very easy-going, but brings some extra intensity. Moderate-length.

I didn't leave any room for suspense. I think this is a really good whisky without considering price. And if you take the latter into account, this is an absurdly good value. I paid $40 for this, and I can confidently say that there are no Scotch whiskies that can even compete with this that I've ever seen for $40 or less. This is one hell of a deal.

I compared this to my bottle of 2018 Oban DE. The latter won that comparison. Not by a wide margin, but it is was quickly evident that that is my preferred Oban expression. This definitely has a place in the lineup though. It punches well above its price point.

I noticed ""Small Cask"" printed on the packaging. After doing a little research, it seems that this is Oban's answer to Laphroaig Quarter Cask, another one of my favorites. Whatever they've done here, it's resulted in a damn fine product. One of the truly remarkable examples of bang-for-buck in the whisky world."
