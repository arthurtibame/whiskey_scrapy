3.0,"Alcohol on the nose. Nice amount of heat. Lots of cinnamon on palate and finish. This was a  PA Wine and Spirits barrel pick. Enjoyed it, but $80 is steep for a 4 year-old bourbon."

4.5,"Nose of simple cinnamon apple, with a slight hint of mahogany in the background. Alcohol forward but creamy initial taste, as your tongue warms a hint of leather and citrus follows up the Virgin American Oak and then dissipates as you swallow. Leaving an incredibly smooth creamy aftertaste."

Palate: little more bite than I was hoping from alcohol. Good sweet flavor after the initial burn though. Definitely young but still very good
Finish: short kinda sweet kinda spicy finish"
