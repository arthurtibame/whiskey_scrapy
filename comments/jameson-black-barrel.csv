4.0,Way better than I expected
3.5,"Nose: Caramel. Fruitiness. Some floral notes. Honey mixing with butterscotch did a very sweet aroma. Some spices and malt.

Palate: Slightly smokey but less than expected. Caramel again but pleasant and not too syrup-like. Spices coming in nicely and citrus on its way down. Copper taste as well giving it a fuller feel.

Finish: Medium. Malt strongest here. Fruit lingering with some caramel. Slight alcohol burn on the way down but it’s Jameson. C'est la Vie.

Overall Thoughts: Pretty good! I think Jameson does an excellent job marketing this whiskey to be above the rest but it’s relatively average to me. Nothing that elevates it to the top tier club. Not bad by any means but it certainly isn’t phenomenal. However, if I were to make a choice between regular Jameson or Black Barrel, I’d go with the regular."

3.5,"After riding high on Caskmates Stout I bought this on sale, normally priced at $39.95. It has been a little underwhelming compared to the Stout. It is nice to sip on but not enough bourbon barrel comes through. It is creamy but more subtle on the taste, and the oak or fruit doesn't come through prominently. It almost disappears on the finish immediately. You have to drink this at the beginning of your night, otherwise you'll barely taste anything after a bourbon that is over 85 proof. I bet if Jameson didn't dilute this to 80 proof, maybe 86 or 90, it would be sooo much better."

The taste is of sweet carmel with subtle notes of spice.  There is some nutty flavor in the tail end of the drink.  One may detect the smoke of the ""black barrel"" in the finish."

3.25,"An incredibly bold nose with distinct aromas of caramel and smoky barrel char.  Green apple fruitiness is still present, now accompanied with a rich candied cherry note.  Soft to the palate, though this one is more astringent than the other two.  Dark caramel, wood spice, maraschino cherry, strong vanilla.  The spirit character of green apple and honey is present, but very much in the background, though the granular sugar texture remains at the finish.

3.5,"Ah, Jameson Black. I remember when I considered this to be a high end whiskey. I've since come a long way, but I do have some fond memories of this one. It's been a couple years, so let's see how this one has held up.

Nose: Classic Irish. Vanilla, cereal, toffee, and caramel, shortbread cookie. It's malty and grainy, but more so the former. I suspect there's a high percentage of single pot still, and it definitely comes across as older than the standard Jameson. A faint hint of jam in the background. Some baking spice, cashew, chestnut, and oak.

Palate: Once again, standard Irish. Cereal, malt, toffee, vanilla, shortbread cookie, and caramel. Into the mid palate I get raspberry and strawberry. Once again, it's apparent that there's a respectable percentage of single pot still whiskey in this blend.

Finish: This is where the 'black' comes into play. Until this point, the barrel hasn't appeared. However, it's prominent right off the bat with this finish. It's accompanied by cinnamon and other spices, and rounded off with the sweet red fruit from the palate.

I'll say it right now. This one is head and shoulders above the rest of Jameson's core range. Damn good stuff. Are there better Irish whiskies? Absolutely. But when you look at balance, quality, and VFM, this one will always be a solid option. Must try for any fan of Irish whiskey. If you don't like standard Jameson, don't write the brand off until you try this one because I'll bet you'll be pleasantly surprised."

3.0,"When I first started exploring Irish whiskey, this was my early go to.  And if you like a sweeter whiskey, I certainly recommend this one.  However, after trying a few other varieties, I decided this one is a little too sweet for my taste.  Don’t get me wrong, it’s a very easy drinking whiskey, but for the money, there are other better options (Bushmills 10...Writer’s Tears is a particular favorite).

The nose is fruity and sweet.  It definitely has that Irish whiskey softness you expect, but the charred oak aging gives it a touch more bite to balance it out.  Good stuff...I’ve just since found better."

4.25,"I’m primarily a bourbon and scotch drinker, and I don’t typically enjoy Irish whisky, as I find it too light and sad, but this one has really started to grow on me. 

It smells very light and fruity, but there’s a familiar bourbony undertone to the nose that is impossible to ignore once you discern it. It’s as though you’re visiting Ireland and run into an old pal from back home in Kentucky. “Hey bro, how’s it going? Did you stick your finger in my whisk(e)y?”

It goes down quite smoothly, as it should at 40% abv , but this juice is a lot more flavorful and complex than many other whiskies I’ve had at the same proof. 

Up front on the palate there’s a soft, grainy flavor which is soon joined by bananas, caramel and nutmeg. It reminds me a lot of bananas Foster, which is a good thing. On the back end, that bourbon note which was discernible to the nose becomes evident to the tongue in a toasty flurry of expatriated flavors. 

This is basically a nice, light(ish), sweet, dessert-type whiskey that can and should be enjoyed any way you please. I don’t know if I enjoy it so much because it’s freaking good in its own right or because of the bourbony characteristics it inherits from the double-bourbon-barrel aging. Who gives a crap?"

3.75,"Black Barrel is a mix of pot still (80% I read somewhere) and grain whiskey that is decently aged, more than you would expect in a $38 bottle of whiskey. I love Irish pot still so I had to try this. It has a fresh fruity smell typical of pot still. In the mouth it is very creamy and has fruit, citrus and a bit of grain taste. The finish is a little spicy with a taste of char, not smoke. Apparently they char the heck out of ex-Bourbon barrels and age the potstill/grain mix in them. You can absolutely taste that char but it doesn't take over. It's kind of like a poor man's Midleton Very Rare and I really like it. The low abv (40%) works in its favor if you want to drink it neat. I didn't have it over ice but it would probably be good in that role, abv be damned. It is not very complex but tastes good and makes a great daily drinker!"

My favorite thing about black barrel is the emphasis on the vanilla, caramel and barrel char notes, and while it’s not incredibly complex, the flavors mingle together perfectly. Nice balance and bold flavors."

4.0,"Best Jameson i have had to this date.

Mahogany color, i dont remember the abv%.

Once it is poured on the glass, you inmidiately get this Bourbonish kind of aroma. On the nose: grapes, plum, smoke, grape juice, banana, and sun tan lotion. Beautiful aroma.

On the palate is a little less appealing, but a great dram still. Its like a bourbon, with butterscotch, oak, almonds, ginger, and a short bitter aftertaste.

Overall i give this one an 80 over 100 because of the short finish. Cheers."
3.5,"Nose: Buttery shortbread.  Sweet orange - zest and flesh.  Flour.  Cream, apricots, persimmons, bananas.  White and brown sugar, vanilla.  Sweet basil.  Oak - just a hint of char.  Somewhat understated.

Palate: Develops on what the nose brings to the table.  Vanilla, sugar, strawberry, apricot, cream.  Orange and persimmon.  Oak is more assertive, I'm getting a reasonable barrel character here, complete with some tannin, barrel bitter, and barrel bite.  Mouthfeel is medium-light.  Finish is medium-short and starts with a pop, the mid-palate opens up to reveal some bright, metallic character.  As things slowly come back down, the oak and fruit play off each other until everything settles down into a vanilla whipped cream with peanuts and blueberries.

Other notes: I eyed the proof of this while opening the bottle and almost immediately said ""I'm going to wish this was higher proof"" - I was spot on.  There are some really interesting things happening here.  Still very Jameson in character, the added oak influence really helps bring something more assertive and bold, while remaining very easy to drink - this feels a little more cohesive and developed, which is likely a function of the fact that I tend to lean towards bourbon."

5.0,Smooth finish.
4.25,"The drinkability of this whiskey is severely underrated. Touch of smoke, caramel and butterscotch. If you like og Jameson and bourbon, you'll love this."
