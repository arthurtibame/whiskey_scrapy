4.25,"This is a very unique whiskey. The blends of bourbon, rye, and scotch make for a unexpected enjoyable whiskey. Noses of vanilla, slight cherry, with a peated overtone. On the taste starts with a sweet oak of bourbon and mint coupling that finishes into a peat smoke."

3.5,Really interesting.  This is a unique whiskey with complexity not typically found.  The smoke from the scotch comes through and the finish is sweet.  Worth a shot.

4.25,Light peach syrup and spice cooked over a campfire. Light smoke notes.  Very nice.

3.0,Well name- Smokey from nose to finish. Dry. A little hot.
4.0,This is the whisky that turned me onto whisky. I like it because I swear I can taste some peated malt which balances out all the American grains. And the smoke isn’t overpowering. The finish is a little bitter which is fine by me.

5.0,I got a double at a really fancy bar in San Antonio. Tasted great!
3.5,"Solid bourbon with a mellow nose containing a slight smoke, reminiscent of ultra-weak peat. Almost a chili/nacho flavor on the palate. It tastes young but not detrimental. Finishes rather quickly but, again, a slight peat, smoky flavor lingers. 
I think it’s worth the effort to try a pour before buying a bottle. I can’t recall the price I bought my bottle at, but likely $35-50. If you want a great entry level for a friend or relative starting their whisk(e)y journey, check out their prairie bourbon. I’ve seen it as low as $20. Interesting to follow as they transition to bottling their own juice, especially with their rye, bourye, and midwinter."

3.25,"The High West Campfire gets me.  It’s just so unique and interesting.  The nose is stone fruits, some honey, dried flowers, and rye notes with the peat and smoke swirling through it all.  The palette starts out like scotch with pest and dry smoke but suddenly turns a corner to rye with some grass and cinnamon and pepper.  There is an instant of sweetness in there before a dry finish of dried fruit and - well - campfire smoke."

4.5,"Nose: tobacco, cloves, ash, floral, rubber - like hugging grandma after she snuck a heater and put on perfume to hide it from grandpa
Taste: it’s called campfire for a reason - that’s definitely how the smoke comes through and it’s different from peaty scotch, there’s also rye spice and sweetness.  This is one that seems to change with every pour.  Not quite as sweet as some previous pours from this bottle, which overall has been less sweet than pours I had at a bar.  
Finish: the campfire smoke doesn’t quit, the rye goes in the dill pickle direction
After reading reviews: not picking up the fruits (blueberry, Flaviar, really?) but the smoke and rye notes are consistent"

3.5,"Had my first taste after hearing I had been promoted due to a resignation in my company. Bright, heavy and some complicated things I need to sit with tonight... but I enjoyed a good companion who is all of those things in this dram. Hits the nose with pears apricots, mintiness and a out of peat. The bourbon sweetness hits first followed by a rye burst of minty fruit, with a mid to back palate smokiness in the background. There’s a lot going on, I do enjoy it!"
4.0,"Batch 15I11, Bottle 2609. This is from 2015, which is when the American portion of this whiskey was a bourbon and a rye that were both sourced from MGP (unlike the new recipe that features some High West distillate). The Scotch portion is undisclosed, though it's speculated that it could be Bruichladich, as Campfire was inspired by a trip to the Islay distillery. At any rate, it's an interesting idea. Let's see what an American-Scotch hybrid has to offer.

Nose: Extremely oaky. Most closely resembles a bourbon, and actually reminds me a lot of something you'd get with the Jim Beam Small Batch Series. Peanut brittle, cola, caramel. Rye spice is a layer behind, adding bready and black pepper notes. Dill as well. A third layer back, I can detect a bit of malt and even a touch of smoke. Something akin to spearmint--tough to place the origin there. The more it sits, the greater the rye notes shine through. I also get some pineapple, orange, and roasted nuts. Interesting and layered nose. Good stuff.

Palate: Vanilla, caramel, and... peppermint? Definitely going to chalk that one up to the Scotch presence. Plenty of oak and baking spice--clove, nutmeg, allspice, black pepper. More peanut brittle and cocoa, now with milk chocolate. Big black cherry and blackberry fruit notes. Some dill, malt, and smoke to round it out. Solid palate.

Finish: Moderate length. More of the peppermint. Oak, black pepper, clove, nutmeg. Dill. Roasted nut and black cherry. A puff of smoke to round it all out. A bit uneventful, but it's consistent with it's true to the nose and palate, both of which were very good.

Experiment well done. They definitely had something with the MGP bourbon + rye and (unnamed) Islay malt combination. Fast forward to 2020 and these are all but gone. The current recipe features High West's own distillate in addition to the MGP/Islay. After trying this, I'm very curious to see what HW distillate will add to what I already deem to be a rock solid composition.

4/5. This is a well-crafted blend. High West took a risk, and it paid off. At $63, I feel the same way about my purchase. Outside of the 2018 recipe, there's really nothing to compare this to. But I'll say that it's some damn fine stuff, and if you can still find it, it's definitely worth a shot."

3.5,Smokey with a hint of peat. Can really taste the rye on the finish. Definitely a unique bottle.

4.25,"Nose: smoke, caramel, vanilla malt, spice, slight honey and grass

Taste: the smoke is far more underwhelming on the palate than the nose. It's there as wood smoke but immediately opens up to balanced notes of honey, vanilla malt, baking spices, and a slight herbal/botanical note. The finish is a malted barrel spice.

Final notes: on the sweeter side but has nice barrel notes and complexity to avoid being one dimensional. If you are a fan of any of the ryes High West has to offer you will be a fan. It simply adds a new dimension with the peated scotch and bourbon blended together for a very balanced and enjoyable whisky to sip alone or with a earth and spice heavy cigar."

2.0,Interesting but this tastes confused to me. If I want something peaty I’ll choose a scotch. The smoke took over the bourbon and rye for me.

4.75,"What can I say- one of my all time favorites. Nice, slightly sweet oak and bourbon notes upfront with a peaty scotch finish. And it’s from Utah!"
4.0,"I love this on ice! The smoke cools and the oak char comes through. I’m a neat bourbon drinker, but this elevates for me with some cubes."
4.0,"This whiskey is definitely interesting, but in a good way.  Going in, I was looking for a half bottle of something I could sip during the weekend when I was on a trip to Texas.  I was down between this and a Texas bourbon.  This one caught my eye because, upon reading the back label, I say the potential for a perfect marriage of Scotch and American Whiskey.  A few years ago, I did something similar and picked up a small bottle of a peated bourbon.  It definitely wasn't my cup of...whiskey, but I appreciated it for the uniqueness.  However, this was nothing like that as it just had a bit of peated malted barely from Scotland in the blend of pure American grain.  This meant that it was still an American whiskey, but there was a hint of smokiness that made it quite delicious and the perfect thing to have in Texas along with some brisket burnt ends.  It has a light and peppery nose with smoky caramel with a hint of walnut.  On the palate it's pretty light and friendly at first, similar to Angel's Envy or Jefferson's Ocean.  Then, the mid-palate  reveals the rye and corn of the whiskey then the finish reveals the peated malt Scotch whisky in all its glory.  It's like a bourbon in the mouth and like a Scotch when you swallow.  Considering I got my start in whiskey from the super smoky Scotches of Islay, I really respect how High West was able to so perfectly blend a super peaty Scotch into a quintessential American Whiskey and make it work.  To be clear, I am judging this based solely on what it is.  It isn't trying to be the best American whiskey out there.  It's just trying to be something casual and unique that will make you think as you drink it.  I will say it completely succeeds in that area.  However, the drawback is that it is quite pricey.  The average, full-sized bottle runs about $60-70 which basically means it strikes any notion of this being a ""casual"" whiskey.  But, I would purely keep this around to show people something unique.  It is a great conversation starter and can really give people the chance to experience something they didn't know existed, and that is where I think this whiskey really shines."

3.5,"Really interesting whiskey here, much more musty peat smoke presence than I thought there would be which is very nice. Has a bit of that herbal rye quality and fresh dill burst that balances out classic bourbon profile. Getting butterscotch and fresh leather."
