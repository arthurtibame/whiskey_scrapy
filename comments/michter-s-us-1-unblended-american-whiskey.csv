4.0,"This is one you have to start with due to the low proof.  Very well balanced, smooth creamy sweetness.  Get a honey / vanilla/ cereal taste.  Slight fruitiness, crisp clean finish.  Would I buy again -Yes, would this be great at cask strength- Absolutely"

1.5,Over oaked high rye whiskey (which is odd because I hear that they use used barrels - can’t call them first fill - this ain’t Scotch.). What am I missing? Bummer bottle.

3.5,"About half way through. Gc. Good daily. Only unique feature is the coating feeling in the aromas to palat

N(3.5): peanuts. Don’t remember getting this before. Maybe because of the air. Creamy feel to the aroma. Dried prune sweetness
P(3.5): comes in coating creaminess. Not a punchy flavor. Light vanilla sweetness. 
F(3.5): some hug. Sweet medium finish. Oak covered vanilla stands out the most."

4.25,I really enjoy this one
4.5,Great neat.  Unbelievably smooth.  Saw some negative reviews for this Whiskey detracting from it because it doesn't taste like bourbon.  Well.. it was never supposed to taste like bourbon.  That's why Michter's has a bourbon.

4.0,"Fresh bottle- broken cork, so had to put it into a cleaned out buffalo Trace bottle... poured myself a dram before doing so. Luckily got the cork with no remnants out. 

Sitting for 5 min- color is dark brown almost amber color. Darkest I’ve had this far. 

Nose- s’mores , and toffee, from a little farther away sweet pickles (I know , weird right?) , maple syrup, banana. 

Taste- deep honey, caramel, a little spice, dark chocolate, a little black pepper finish.

Mouth feel- initially it felt light, but as I kept at it, it actually has a deep thick richness. Not too oily, little spice that sets in the back of the throat. Lingers pretty long"

4.75,"Beautiful amber colour.  

Nose: Brown sugar, vanilla, cream, creme brulee, with subtle cinnamon and nutmeg

Palate: Fantastically cool and smooth to start with a very creamy mouthfeel. Rich maple syrup and chocolate chip cookie flavours. Nice oaky tannins evolve next.  Definitely lots going on here!

Finish: Long.  Wood smoke, lots of dried fruits here. More notes of brown sugar linger for a long time. 

This is a fantastic whisky and I can't emphasize enough how pleased I am that Michter's went against the ""grain"" and created this non-bourbon, non-rye, whisky. Absolutely fantastic and one of my all time favourites."

4.0,"Neat in a glencairn.  Simple yet attractive packaging.  Medium amber with little viscosity.  Thin legs.

Aromas of brown sugar, banana, clove, and cinnamon candies.  A bit of dusty corn, then a puff of spice - the cinnamon oil to match the candies.  Appealing but not as gentle as expected.

Sweet, rich, creamy, and pleasantly spiced.  Cream soda laced with sweet mint gum.  Butterscotch and vanilla.  Maple syrup.  Apple.  A bit tart, in a good way. 100% on board with the reviewer's apricot.

Quite delicious.  Great balance and cohesion - all the facets play together nicely.  Brings bold flavors despite the low proof.  The only downside is the somewhat high pricetag for an atypical, low proof, NAS American whiskey.  But these days, the price to play is going up and it feels extremely well-made.  This seems to be a very popular pick with mass appeal and it IS quite sweet, thus the approachability... but there is a lot to like.  Of an ilk with Elijah Craig small batch, but a clear upgrade IMO."

5.0,Mellower than your typical bourbon.  Very smooth and flavorful
3.25,Nose is spicy with some alcohol some butterscotch too. Pallet is buttery Carmel it’s a little hot at the end but no much. Finish doesn’t last long but is smooth. Overall it’s definitely a bourbon taste but lighter. Not lighter in taste just over which dies make it smooth and less bite.

5.0,"My favorite Whiskey. Nose is full of vanilla cream, and light brown sugar/caramel notes. Pallets is very smooth and has a silky mouth feel. I can’t recommend Michter’s American Whiskey enough. Go buy yourself a bottle and you won’t be disappointed."

4.5,This is why I live in this country.
4.0,"Creamy, subtle, soft. 

Coffee analogy: If bourbon is like fresh black coffee, Michter's American is like a latte. 

It's a bourbon mashbilll aged in USED oak which is unique amongst large distilleries. 
The nose is similar to a bourbon: vanilla, cherry, honey... nothing too exciting.
The taste is different. First thing I noticed is the mouthfeel. Its like drinking cream. It coats the mouth like velvet while leaving hints of vanilla, spice, sweet corn, and finishes with some wood notes. It's bourbon but with softer edges. 

Its a very pleasant whiskey and one I think I'd be likely to share with those who are new to bourbon. Also, I would love to see more distilleries experiment with used oak."

4.25,"The nose has a fruit forward cherry and apricot note, with a walnut and honey afterthought. Gentle sweetness honey taste quickly followed by a ripe juicy apricot kick and a back end of bitter pecan. Palate lingers for a medium length with sweet honey on the lips and a bitter nut shell flavor on the back of the tongue."
3.75,"Beautifully complex sweetness made of vanilla, coffee creamer and caramel. Slight fruitiness in there as well. 

The flavors are just a little too subtle being bottled at such a low proof which i consistently find with michters. This one is tough because the flavors are more subtle being aged in used oak but also more complex at the same time. 

Overall a thin but lovely whiskey."

4.25,"First time tasting any Michter's products neat. I found a couple bottles of this at local grocer with dates from 2015 & 2016 so I grabbed them. I know the juice inside doesn't age any more than when taken from the barrel but for some unknown reason I feel like finding older stuff that sits on the shelf is a ""find"". So with that out of the way let's get on to the review. 

Nosing this one doesn't give much of a preview of what you're about to taste. The nose is a standard sweet bourbon smell much like an Evan Williams Single Barrel or a Four Roses Small Batch. Nothing special. 
First sip is a whole different story. There's a blast of flavors including vanilla, honey, & toffee all at once. I love the sweetness this one has compared to many other whiskeys I've tasted. I'm a fan. Now the one thing this has going for me that I really like is the fact that it is only 80 proof so I don't need to dilute it or sip it and feel like my mouth is being singed on fire. The finish is smooth especially since it's only an 80 proofer and it lingers a little while, not long but enough to remind you how special it is. 
 I'm really glad I bought this one after looking at it for months. The one complaint I have is the price it sells at. The $45 price tag seems a bit high for the proof but to justify the price it is a smooth fellow that goes down easy and really has some great flavors going on. Looking forward to exploring more of the Michters line after trying this one out.

4.25,"The nose has a distinct minty/herbal character. Prickly orange rind spice. A mild gasoline/fusel burn. It's as if the bitters have already been added. As it mellows, mild vanilla, maple and caramel; the vanilla pops with a droplet.

Thick oily legs trickle down the inside of the glass. 

The taste is a wonderful barrel char at first: bitter and sharp on the sides of the tongue. More of that orange peel. Salt and pepper spices. The tannins from the barrel a pucker and a sharp bite. The dry barrel char really dominates, with some touches of apple skins, pear and even banana cream pie. Black tea.

The finish is charcoal embers, tobacco ash and a mint/menthol coolness. The char burn never truly subsides, just turns the volume down. This is just chock full of roasty, dry flavors."
