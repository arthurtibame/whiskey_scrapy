2.0,"Sweet highlights are threaded with a salty tang.  The Campbeltown funk translates to me as a salty, tangy, and mildly chemical flavor. Adding water turns it into something lighter and more watery than most other bourbon-casked peers, reminding me of tequila reposado or a rum.  I won't be purchasing another bottle again.  The Kilkerran 12 is a much tastier Campbeltown scotch.

4.0,"Sharper than I remembered it from first taste - perhaps as it’s a new bottle, perhaps feeling every bit the 46% without the influence of several tastes before it as I had the first time. I enjoy this flavor profile, particularly as it is peaty without the smoke and the trademark earthy funk is there throughout. Thin mouthfeel. Oily. Cinnamon aftertaste reminds me of big red gum. I’m looking forward to the CS 12 which I still haven’t cracked. Will taste these two together perhaps with the kilkerran blind to see how they all fare."

3.75,"And here we are. The last dram of a now empty bottle. A fine bottle it was. When I try new whisky I always try to find something unique that stands out from the general variants. And Springbank for sure is unique - you can easily blind-identify its - that’s how defined it flavors are. 

Nose: dry grains, summer hay, apple peel, nutty, lots of vanilla, lemon, sour peaches, crispy cereals and surrounding everything a soft and delicious peat - just minor but it really adds to the character of this intriguing nose. 

Palate: sweet peat at first, wood chips, vanilla, sweet cookies with a bid of cream, hay and then there is a very unusual hard to grasp taste that is bid like seaweed or wet moss. It is just really great."

5.0,"Nose: earthy/rubbery like car tires, peat smoke, brine, hint of brown sugar/caramel
Palette: smoke, black pepper, brine, light sweet fruit - apricot?
Finish: peat smoke, black pepper, hints of that sweet fruit continues in the background"
4.75,"Peat and fruit with a little bit of funk, like a Jamaican rum."
3.75,"Attractive yet simple bottle and packaging.  A golden straw hue.  Thin consistency with extremely slow to form legs.

Smoky, sweet, and hot on the nose... but clean.  Charred orange rind.  Cereal grain.  Hints of marzipan and pear.  Faint honeysuckle.

A pleasant, creamy mouthfeel despite the apparent lack of viscosity.  Initial beet sugar sweetness transitions quickly to tart grapefruit peel, then moderate peat smoke and astringent toasted oak.  Pear lingers in the background, but overall an aggressive palate befitting a young, brash whisky.  Rosewater, laced with threads of cinnamon.  A clearly saline backbone complicated with hints of sherried hazelnuts.  Grilled pineapple.  The tangy finish lingers impressively.

Truly a mouthful. Challenging; sweet; tart; smoky. It is not for everybody, but if you're looking for bold flavor and complexity, step right up - you won't be disappointed.  Will definitely enjoy the bottle."
4.25,"This distillery has cult status. People in the know swear by SB and praise everything they put out. This is the entry level but enjoys its own following. The opposition claims this is overpriced and has a funky taste. I wanted to decode the Springbank mystery for myself. Poured neat, this is as advertised. Peaty(more bog than smoke) like the mud caked on your boots after walking in the moors. Tangy, as in overripe citrus. Red grapefruit is prominent, blood orange comes to mind. Some smoke yes but its damp from salty ocean spray. There is malt hidden under there and some seasoned barrel. Mouthfeel is a little thin yet the flavors are deep. The peat, fruity tang, salty smoke and dry wood carry from nose to finish. This is a complete scotch and is savory and satisfying. Now if you don't like this profile then its not for you......but if this pushes your buttons you will join the cult. Im ready for the kool-aid and the 15yr.......93/100....sign me up"

3.75,"Color: Golden honey

Nose: Sherry, peat, ripe red apples and oranges, malt, hints of vanilla and oak

Palate: Peat, sherry, malt, cinnamon, vanilla, oily

Finish: Lingering peat and sherry notes with a bit of spice on the tongue.

Springbank has to be one of my favorite distilleries. Springbank 10 is one of my go to bottles. Peat up front with a prominent sherry note, this dram clings to the tongue nicely and is well balanced. If you let the juice develop, you’ll find hints of vanilla and cinnamon to round out this beauty."

4.0,"A solid dram that excels at being balanced for such a young whisky.  The nose has the familiar peat aroma along with apple and pear.  The taste confirms the nose, with a nice balance of fruit and light smoke.  It goes down smooth, with only the slightest bit of burn, which isn't unexpected with it being 46% abv.  There is no real need to add water.  It seems to get even a little more on the fruitier side after 30 mins in the glass.  Its definitely an everyday type dram that is well worth the $60 or so price tag.  A solid 4, possible 4.25, either way very good."
3.5,"Can definitely taste the sherry influence with some bright, fruity tangs. There's some heavy oak, some slight earth, and only a hint of smoke. It has a tiny chocolate covered pretzels thing going on like it's region mate, Glen Scotia, but much lighter and with much less depth. There's a good malt influence but the sherry tang really washes everything out early. This is much fruitier than I hoped. There's a lot of bourbon profiles happening, especially the Four Roses cinnamon heat at the end. But then it quickly turns back to a tongue coating sherry stickiness. But it's also like a ""diet"" or ""zero sugar"" fakeness to it that lingers and lingers...like when I drank that Vitamin Water Zero accidentally that one time. 

I have to admit, Glen Scotia 15 is one of my favorite go-to sippers and made me really want to try another Campbeltown offering but this is not as sophisticated and too sherried for me. This isn't bad, especially for a 10 year expression, but I really expected deeper and richer ""funk"" from it, given what I've heard from others. Not to keep bringing up Glen Scotia as my Campbeltown flagship, but as an Islay lover, I appreciate Glen Scotia's take on an Islay puff and sea funk balanced with the chocolate pretzels, salt, and sugar cookies that it brings and hoped for a similar take here. Springbank 10 isn't memorable for me, which is what usually occurs when too much sherry is involved, so just a decent bottle to try for only $65."

4.25,"Springbank, i have only had two of your expressions and i got to say, you impress me. This are actually good drams, the ones you can enjoy everyday.

Bottled at 46%abv

On the nose, grape candy, earthy, heather, burnt crest, grass, petrichor, hay. 

On the palate: an oak burn but a pleasant one, vanilla, oak. A little straightforward but good. 

The aftertaste was amazing. An absolutely pleasant spice bomb. Perfect score here.

Overall i give this dram a nice 88/100 and it surely feels like more."

4.25,"Probably the most complex scotch I’ve had thus far. I taste oranges and a bit of brine. The peat flavor is a lot less pronounced than I expected. Pretty big on the alcohol heat, but that went away with a few drops of water. Overall very impressive."

4.25,"Smooth, like a friend of bourbon but a single malt"
4.25,"A follow up from my first taste of this glorious nectar just 9 says ago. This is the first pour from a fresh bottle. Tasted neat in a glencairn.

The pour is a very pale apple juice color. There is some sheeting on a swirl with small, slow tears. The nose is floral and peaty at the same time. Cloves and vanilla, honey and fresh lumber, peat smoke and brine all come through.

This has great mouthfeel. It's sweet, rich, and svelte. I'm tasting great floral bouquets and delicate seaside elements over a honeyed drizzle that's topped with just the right amount of pepper. 

Springbank is a great counterpoint to Ardbeg Uigeadail, tame and refined where the Oogie is bold and forward. As complex as Lagavulin 16, this is a full step  softer. 

This might be the best value in peated scotch whiskey on the planet. Buy this before the price goes up."

4.0,"Good smooth peated malt. Fruity and malty, not a whole lot of brine it’s oak. It’s bright and sweet, but still plenty peaty. It doesn’t have the campfire smoke that a Laphroaig has, and I appreciate that. Yummy."

4.25,I am sitting at a barbecue restaurant with my lovely wife of four decades. I am drinking this very very good scotch. For the sake of my marriage this review will be brief. A bottle of this will be on my bar next week.
