5.0,"Got this as a Christmas present and opened as a new year treat. Very mellow dram. Sweet and fruity nose. Initially strong on the palate but a floral hints open up on the tongue. Light smoky finish.

For all its complexity, very approachable whisky."

4.0,"So smooth! Almost too smooth considering the price, ill keep my taketsuru 21 but really good. Second try I liked it more, something really subtle and composed going on  in there. Do NOT add ice, this is a very delicate whiskey. I need a bottle to fully evaluate, each try has been so ""special"" that I feel the expectation is clouding the experience"

3.0,"Had a vertical Hibiki tasting: Some lovely 1.5oz pours of Harmony ($10), 12 year ($22.50), and the 21 year ($75).  I feel like Hibiki 21 is for people who enjoy giving and receiving commemorative pens.  They see the big picture of accomplishment, and appreciate effortless precision and technique.  I am not one of those people.
    
    So, my big picture perspective, even the top-of-the-shelf 21 year Hibiki loses out to the 12 year Yamazaki.  Hibiki, as a brand, is all about harmony, meditation, asking questions without answers, writing haikus, and becoming aware of your nature and nature itself.  Fine and dandy.  But when I pay $75 for a dram, I want Godzilla.  
    
    NOSE: Very floral.  Like with Hibiki 12, I’m stuck on cherry blossoms after a light rain.  Terroir is just a nice way to say stereotyping.  Richer, more buttery, and more nutty than the 12.  I do not get sandalwood oils with the other two Hibikis (they promised I would!), but I get some here.  It’s very perfumy, like you want to pour some into a Glade plug-in.
    
    PALATE: Soft, flowery, gentle.  Full body that’s all fat and no muscle.  Oily.  Walnut oil, citrus oils.  Buttery sweetness with a hint of bitterness, ala Crème brulee with burnt sugar.  Lovely apricots and nectarines.  Plums and sultanas.  It tastes expensive, to be sure.
    
    FINISH: Is that peat?  I’ll call it lapsong suchong.  Stereotyping again.  Layers of various stone fruit notes, essential wood oils, rich fruitcake, slowly fading.  This is a whiskey that never fought back, for better and worse.
    
    WITH WATER: Water kills Hibiki.  Seriously.  It’s like the twist ending to M. Night Shyamalan’s Signs.
    
    VERDICT: To summarize: it’s a blend that appeals to the tastes of the masses, and the pockets of the fortunate few; floral nose; luxurious and balanced palate; a little peat on the finish; does not like water; overpriced and overhyped, in my estimation.  Sounds like Johnny Walker Blue?  To be fair, Hibiki is 43% ABV and has a little more oomph, especially winning out on the finish.  JW King George V is 43%.  I’ve never tried King George, and it’s priced in the same ballpark as Hibiki 21 ($450-ish).  If I ever make fuck you money, I’ll do a side-by-side between Hibiki 21 and King George.  And I’ll have Glenfiddich 12 with a crystal dropper  instead of water to zero the palate in between drams and to open up the whiskies.
    
    MARK: 84/100.  Minus one star for the price."

4.0,This is a very smooth whisky and with a complex sweet fruity and toffee Flavours but also a bit smoky. I dislike Peaty whiskies but the peatiness in this whisky is nicely matched and I love it. But is it worth the current price though ? I don't think so and looking for something similar if anyone can recommend :)

5.0,"The second to last day before the new year. @PBMichiganWolverine graciously provide to our little touring group. I know I will not be doing a sampling on the eve, so before the world comes to an end, I figure I should taste this sample. 

The color is golden brown, almost like a light Amaretto. 

A fruit bowl of a nose which contains pears, apricots, banana, black berries, ripened plumb with cherries. There is an earthy quality underlying the fruity prominence. A small amount of autumn spices: cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves.  Add some honey and vanilla sweetness. Being an relative old man, give it time to get it’s legs. All so delicately balanced. 

A lightweight body that brings forth light brown sugar sweetness and remains throughout the palate lifespan. Charred oak, cinnamon, leather and Cherry Coke. There is a slight nuttiness with chestnuts and walnuts that forms before the finish. 

A cinnamon dominant finish with orange bitters, black pepper and leaves a lasting woody charcoal fade. 

The is one to take in slowly. The aromas are fantastic, one of fruitiest noses I have experienced and the balance throughout out is impeccable. The lightweight body makes this easy to imbibe.  From beginning to end, it’s near perfection.  I am thankful to @PBMichiganWolverine  generosity that I was able to taste this before the end of the world. [95/100][Tasted: 12/30/17]"
5.0,"This dram does not need a drop of water at all. For the nose, I get floral properties, deep light and dark fruit like raspberries, pears, strawberries, and white grapes. No peat, but a light nice smoke flavor. Pleasant oil with a medium mouth coat. On the palate, more fruit like banana, pineapple, confection, vanilla, oak, and marshmallow. The finish is nice and long with some powdered sugar and syrupy notes. 4.75. I have to kowtow to Pranay for the chance to taste this one. I can definitely see why it's rated so high on par with the Highland Park 18, another whisky with supreme balance. The theme for this dram needs to be a classic. I am going to pick ""Matte Kudasai"" by King Crimson. It translates to ""please wait.."" and patience is always key to enjoying a dram like this."

4.0,"Hibiki 21 Year falls victim to unmerited exclusivity while defining how amazing Japanese Whiskey can be.

First things first, I love Suntory and I’ve never tried anything from the Hibiki line I didn’t like. These are always well crafted and never cease in creating smiles and beautiful memories.

You’ll Instantly find a rich nose, sugary with sherry notes evident. This dram is a tad earthy, highlighting wood, sawdust, dried fruits like plum and dates and an elegant floral aroma. Lowlights reveal vanilla, almond, dried nuts and caramel.

The mouth feel is mild to medium bodied with a fine heat. Entry carries a dry finish, approachable and smooth. There’s no mistaking the aging on this one. The finish stays a while and delivers on the satisfaction you’re hoping for. Simply put, this is definitively Hibiki and it’s amazing.

All that said, at $500 a bottle, this is way too expensive. That price point prohibits many from this experience and while it is incredible, one can find similar experiences at less than half the cost.

5.0,"I’ve been adding reviews to Distiller from the Barreled app that I’ve been using for a few years now to try and even them out. Tonight I posted the review for my 150th whisky and I made it for this wonderful Piece of Japanese artwork. 

This marks my 150th whisky reviewed on Barreled, so to celebrate the occasion I decided to review a top shelf whisky. 

Hibiki 21 is a blended Japanese whisky aged in a combination of American, European and Japanese oak. Bottled at 43% ABV and I have no info currently regarding any chill filtration or colorant. This pours a beautiful deep amber. 

The nose is so very different than anything I’ve ever had before. Incredibly floral and savory. It’s like cherry blossoms wrapped up in undercooked bacon. Reminds me also of a cherry sausage that is made at one particular supermarket in northern Michigan. Marvelous polished oak. Floral honey. Sherry notes start to creep in. Warm apple and pear pies, raisins and sweet syrup. Warming wood spices and a baked potato covered in butter. Vanilla, caramel and molasses. Towards the end it takes on a slightly grassy note. Truly enigmatic and wonderful. 

The palate starts full on sherry. Cherries, syrup and a thin layer of smoke. Old oak sanded smoothed and rubbed with orange oil. Vanilla, floral honey and chamomile. Buttery biscuits and a far off roasted corn note. Dangerously drinkable. 

A light bodied mouthfeel, but so silky smooth and mouthwatering. 
A medium long finish with sherried oak, orange oil and vanilla. 

So smooth and flavorful without even a hint of alcoholic harshness. Sweet, savory and, again, smooth. Fully matured and layered with complexity. “Sadly”, I was only able to review a 1 oz sample instead of a 2 oz, but I would have been happy with a 1/4 ounce. I wish I could find and/or afford a full bottle, but at today’s prices and availability I doubt that will happen. Still it was a superb whisky deserving of its many accolades. A big thanks to @PBMichiganWolverine for getting that big promotion at work and celebrating by opening this rare whisky and providing me with a sample. Thanks buddy. 4.75
Cheers"

Taste - Fruity/floral dark honey, spiced honey drizzled grilled pineapple/peaches, sweet tobacco, leather, subtle hint of dark stone fruits.
Finish - Long lingering sweet leathery/oaky spice, light fruity medicinal sweet, like that of goji berries and longan, lightly drying.
Score - 96/100
Final Thoughts - I really really hate to add to the hype of Japanese whisky but this is a very well put together and balanced like their other offerings. This is a very excellent blend of malt & grain whiskies put together in a beautiful bottle and is a fantastic mix of dark and light flavors all in one package. The age shows in this with the darker color, but the heavy oak influence is subdued a bit and the flavors just work together. A nice balance of dark flavors (leather/tobacco/dark fruits) balanced out by light flavors (honey/grilled peaches/pineapple). I'd say this is definitely something best sipped neat without the addition of any water since it's already at a respectable 43% and very well balanced as is."

5.0,"I had bought this bottle years back, and finally opened it last night with some friends.   First  thing that strikes you is the appearance of the bottle itself.  Twenty four sides to it, and a heavy weight and feel.   The liquid itself is deep mahogany...not sure if coloring is added.  Pop open the cork and you immediately smell sandlewood and cherry blossoms.  Floral taste.  Some  incense like you smell in Asian temples.  I think that might be effect of the mizunara?  Overall, it's a really good dram, worthy of a special occasion.  I'm sure I paid much less years ago, but prices now seem to be $500-600...not sure if I'd spend that much on it today, certainly not ' blow your mind' level that warrants anywhere close to that price tag.  At $150, a no-brainer 5 stars.  But at $500-600...not so sure.  On a side note:  Do not add water or ice.  It kills the floral aromas and sandlewood taste...turns it bitter.   Update 12/1:  now that bottle is almost empty, oxidation has set in.  I had a small taste last night, and got a pronounced sandlewood aroma.  Never tasted that in a whisky before, and certainly never smelled it anywhere outside Indian or Buddhist temples"

5.0,"Simply magnificent!  A fruity and floral nose swirls lusciously in a dense mixture of sweet ethanol. The bouquet is so perfect you wonder if consumption by inhalation is at all possible. The liquid has yet to hit the palate and I’m already doodling 5 stars on the paper in front me. Stunningly smooth, the nectar embraces you with the touch of a loved one. It’s intricately composed of woods ranging from the 3 corners of a whisky drinker’s lopsided world, yet clearly articulated as Stephanie has so aptly pointed out. I guess I could say more, but her review and those of others here have already done so satisfactorily. Many thanks to my friend @PBMichiganWolverine for this incredible sample."

Very rich with notes of dried fruit, burnt caramel, cherries, berries, a little Hakushu smoke, and mizunara on the nose and chocolate covered fruits on the palate, and a toffee and fruity finish. Update: Got a $25 1 oz pour of this at Sanford’s Astoria and citrus and toffee joined the flavor mix."

5.0,"I recently did a 3-way, Japanese whiskey tasting flight using samples generously supplied by my NJ connection: @PBMichiganWolverine.  This well-aged blend from Hibiki easily finished in first place- besting the Nikka Whisky From The Barrel and Ohishi Single Sherry Cask.  I knew this going in so it wasn’t a surprise.

The Hibiki 21 has gained a reputation as being one of, if not, the best Japanese whisky on the market.  It’s bottled at 43% and is amber and gold in the taster.  A few watery drops and thin legs get left behind when you twirl it up after the initial pour.

The nose is, well...one of the greatest things you’ll ever have the privilege of smelling.  Florals and perfumes greeted me right out of the gate.  Over time the fruit basket arrives:  orchard fruits, fresh cherry mash, ripe and bursting raspberries and grape must.  A hint of vanilla and oak cask creates a wall that keeps those notes from escaping.  I let this thing sit for 45 minutes and nothing lessened or dissipated.  I could be perfectly content smelling this until the liquid evaporated, but the angels don’t deserve another share of this stuff.

The palate doesn’t back down one bit either- brown sugar, fresh ground cinnamon wake the sleeping tongue before relenting to honey, sherry grapes and vanilla.  A toasted bread note weighs on the back of the tongue and brings the slightest bit of gravity to this whisky.  To this point is all felt so light and airy it actually needs this moment.  There isn’t one ounce of harshness or heat from the alcohol.  A nice, light mouthfeel that isn’t oily or dry.  Perfection.

The finish feels juicy initially.  The instant I began to question whether or not I was drinking whisky I got charcoal and oak spice.  It was like it was on cue.  Orange peel lingered and cooled the last seconds of burn from the spice.  This is one of the most complete experiences I’ve ever had from a whisky.  Well done.

Overall, this easily lands in my Top 5 of all time.  I still have the Yamazaki 18 in there as well and I’d love to have these two side by side, even though I doubt I could declare a true winner.  I believe bottles of this are currently going for over $600.  You could buy a lot worse bottles for that price, so I have to say it’s still worth it based on quality.  Thanks Pranay- I guess I know what I’m bidding on at the next auction.  5 stars.  Cheers."

4.5,"I just had a quick whiff and a single taste, so I didn’t do it justice. But the short experience didn’t leave me breathless yearning for more. 

It’s a familiar Japanese profile: gentle, refined sherry with floral notes. Here the blend of Chita grain whiskey brings that buttery character, especially on the finish.

Is it really 99/100? No way. There must be hundreds of vintage single casks in Scotland that blow this out of the water. Is it 4.5/5? Absolutely!"

4.5,"Tasted at Whiskey House SD on 6/26/19. 

The nose on this smells like old furniture and a bit musty, but in a way that makes sense for a 21 year old whisky! On the pallet the fruit flavor really shine, but i wouldn't say that they are over powering. 

It is definitely different from any Japanese whisky i have tasted, but for me I am curious to try the Hibiki 17 year because I think that is probably a better age for this particular whisky."

4.5,"In Kyoto, you can buy the most exquisite green tea cookies on this planet: quality ingredients, perfectly composed, but utterly expensive. The same applies to Hibiki 21. On the nose, papaya, kiwi and subtle hints of soot mix with sandalwood, dried herbs and incense. Like a roller coaster, the taste catapults you through the flavor wheel: juicy, fruity, spicy and floral, intense and rounded, this blend sparkles like a diamond. Mizunara, icing sugar, and, I kid you not, green tea cookies with white chocolate crown the slowly fading finish. A world-class whisky!

RATING: 4.5/5.0 stars ≙ 91 pts → SUPERB"

4.75,"A generous sample from bourbonjosh.  Admittedly excited to try this as it has a 99 on Distiller.

Nose: Vanilla, poached pear, wood almost like cedar, grassy background notes, and a ton of butterscotch.  Huge butterscotch punch in the nose.  This smells awesome!

Flavor: Sweet wood notes meet and more vanilla and butterscotch.  A little bit of a funky wood note from the barrel that I associate with sherried scotch with just a little bit of baking spices in the background.

Finish:  Wow...medium length finish with a ton of toasted coconut, toasted oak, roasty toasty notes almost like you'd associate with a dark coffee but without the bitterness.  Sweet and pleasant and then fading in to a hint of dried fig and dried cherry.

This stuff is awesome!  Too bad I can't find it."

Palate- dark juicy cherries, wood spice, puffs of smoke, plums, cinnamon apples, caramel with sea salt, french vanilla

Finish- oily, long finish with wood spices, honey and a bit of smoke

That is one of the single greatest noses i’ve ever experienced with a whisky. So complex and inviting. The palate is nothing short of amazing as well. Perfect amount of smoke. Complex, with beautiful notes of spice and delicate fruits. Finishes with a long finish and an oily mouthfeel. The hype around this is REAL. Not $700 real, but no whisky is in my opinion, but this is the best whisky i’ve tried to date."

4.75,"Nose: Peat with a sherry kick and slight orange citrus

Palate: Opens up like a bitch, but the spice kicks in after half a second and opens up to a complex world of oak, peat, and vanilla. Approaches the cusp of too much spice and too much peat, but settles down just before it hits the breaking point. A master blend.

Finish: Notes of caramel and slight peat. Goes on for days. 

If you have the chance to buy a bottle, go for it. This is the baseline for high-end Japanese blended whiskey. 

Probably paid too much for the bottle, but haven’t seen this one in the wild for a very long time. Would buy it again at the same price point."

5.0,"Is this my graduation day? This is not a dram, this is a ""dream"".

For my 300th whisky review i decided (like 20 whiskies ago) to finally taste the world most awarded blended whisky ever, the Japanese Hibiki 21yo, and it was everything it was supposed to be, the best blended whisky ever made. Very similar to my other favorite blended whisky, the Extinct Johnnie Walker Premier (also made only for Japan).

On the nose it is absolutely spectacular. The end of the world in the nose. Paradise.

Notes i got on the nose: Amontillado sherry, Fresh orange jam, Coffee; Couple of minutes later: tiramisu, Citric note, orange note, Hay; So complex.
Sugar syrup notes hidden in the back. Very fresh aroma, Interior of prunes, Orange peel with dark chocolate; Floral notes.

Viscocity is so high that i have written all this and still they havent reached the base of the dram.
The aroma is strong. Wonderful. Rose stem, Mostly coffee notes, absolutely Adictive. After the first sip maple honey appears on the nose as well as créme caramel. More and more caramel on the nose. Slight Vanilla.

All that. In the nose. The most complex nose ever. Ever.

For obvious reasons the palate wasn't going to match the super super super complexity on the nose. Still it is a marvelous dram. 

Wonderful on the palate. It is amazingly balanced, the right amount of spicyness, with the right amount of oak, with the right amount of sweetness all happening at the same time. Incredibly easy to drink and pleasant.

Sherry, Clove, Bitter coffee beans, Dark chocolate, Almonds and butterscotch. Vanilla. After the third sip: caramel and oregano.

Finish is a mixture of ginger and herbal notes in such a pleasant way that you feel rewarded. Thick créme caramel. 

I did left one micro sip to taste it with water. One drop later, nose dilutes to milk powder with lemon peel. Becomes super herbal on the palate, almost medicinal, exactly like drinking magnesium chloride.
No grain was felt. 

The score, easy to guess: 100 over 100. It might be 200 easily. Something i must tell you, i am not sure that this one has beaten my all time favorite the Glenmorangie Signet, but it is surely the only one that has stood up to it. I would definitively pay (if i had the money lol) the $550 it costs, and i will save it to drink a dram in special occasions."

5.0,"Hibiki 21 is a truly stunning example of what we’ve come to respect the most of Japanese whiskey.  The nose opens with cherry blossom, plums and incense spice. It then moves to fruit cake and creme caramel. The palate is buttery and even as the long, lingering finish reminds one of Louis XIII Cognac. If you ever find a bottle, which is almost impossible, buy it!"
