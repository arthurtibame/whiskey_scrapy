4.0,"Nose- raisins, toffee, caramel, rum soaked bananas, apples, ripe citrus, mint

Palate- Dark fruits, honey, ripe bananas, dark caramel. Added water bring out juicy pear notes and ginger

Finish- medium, oily finish with notes of toffee and spice

Really well balanced. Heavy sherry notes on the nose and palate, with a good amount of spice mingled in. Adding water brings out some more spice and brighter fruits such as pear and banana. Not my favorite sipper in the world, but still a damn good dram"
