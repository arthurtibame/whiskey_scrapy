2.0,"This collaboration between Compass Box and BrewDog is a UK-only release meant to be drunk alongside beer as a Boilermaker. I tried a small sample on its own and found it lacking in personality. There’s grain in this blend, so it’s a lot softer than many Compass Box whiskies. The malt component includes Clynelish, but I couldn’t detect any of its characteristics."
