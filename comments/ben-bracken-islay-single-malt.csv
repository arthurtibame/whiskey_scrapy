4.0,"Pretty good for its price (~£17 for 0.7 liters). A distinct earthy aroma with notes of oakwood and smoked cheese. Full and warm mouthfeel, with a taste of smoked ham spiced with notes of coffee beans transitions into a subtly bitter, smokey aftertaste."
4.0,"Thick viscosity, smoky, good depth. Extra star for the low price. I definitely recommend this but now I can't find it anywhere.
This has an amazing viscosity for the price, compared to other lower prices whiskies. Wonderful peatiness and a boatload of complex after tastes.
Do yourself a favor and try it. For the price you can't go wrong."
