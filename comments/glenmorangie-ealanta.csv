5.0,"First: the reference to an ""unusually young age"" doesn't make much sense, considering this has been aged for 19 years, according to Glenmorangie's web site.

I found this to be a very compelling iteration of the Glenmorangie spirit. Lots and lots of orange zest and a strong nuttiness, almond or Brazil nuts, on the nose. Oak, obviously, is pervasive but also some sweet butterscotch or toffee. Slight biscuit scent.

On the tongue the orange zest is still surprisingly apparent. Very nutty as well. Lots of oak notes but a different kind of oak, one that is spicy and zesty in a way I've never quite experienced. Coconut. Lots of oaky vanilla sweetness. Gingery finish that a long and lovely."

5.0,This is a phenomenal Scotch and Distiller needs to correct the score. It should be in the 90s.

4.0,"If you’re able to attend one of the launch events for Glenmorangie’s latest Private Edition, you’ll be given a random token to sample one of the nine previous releases. If your token has a number four on it (either by chance or persuasion), you’ll get a chance to try this rare bottling. This is a classic malty, creamy Highland whisky, well rounded, robust and long of flavor, just like the slightly less scarce 19-year-old travel retail exclusive that succeeded it. Either one will stand testimony to the peaks the Glenmorangie spirit can reach if it’s left to age in a cask that doesn’t stray too far from tradition."

oak and lots of wood."
4.25,"Nose shows pina colada notes (pineapple, coconut,) along with a touch of orange.  On the palate, there is light salt throughout.  Marmalade notes, along with tangerine.  Finishes with quite a bit of lingering salt.  It really is unique and fantastic, but not quite amazing."

5.0,"This is honestly the most complex but still enjoyable whisky I've had. I get wet river stone, old leather and wood in a study, with some light sweetness in the background. This was a gift and I'll likely never get to try it again, but it reawakened my enthusiasm."
