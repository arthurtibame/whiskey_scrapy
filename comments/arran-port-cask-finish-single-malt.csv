4.0,Full bodied with peat and brine forward on the nose and finish.  Subtle hints of chocolate and fruit.
3.75,"노즈 : 과실향과 견과류의 고소한 향,
 곡물향과 약간의 포트와인 특유의 향

테이스트: 포트와인의 과실맛과 단맛이 탁 나왔다가 스파이시함과 함께 견과류의 고소한 맛

피니쉬: 빵의 단맛과 견과류의 고소한 맛이 복합적임"

Avent 2019 - 15/24.
Enfin une victoire écrasante de mes Cowboys. Quoi de mieux que de fêter ça avec ce merveilleux whisky fini en fûts de porto? Il y a des années que je n'avais pas déposé mes lèvres sur ce délicieux nectar et je m'en veux. Je pense que je vais aller me procurer cette bouteille dès qu'une place se libère sur mon étagère!"

3.25,"Nose - Pomelo, red berries, dark caramel, orange, raisins

Taste - Nice ginger spice, flamed orange zest, dark apple/pear juice, bit tannic/dry, light raisin sweet, light citrus pith bitter

Finish - Lingering tingle, very drying, almost starchy like eating an unripe plantain, light raisin sweetness with apple/pear undertones

Score - 75/100

Final Thoughts - This was sadly a bit disappointing. It had a nice interesting nose but fell a tiny bit flat on the palate. The nose presented a nice balanced Scotch with nice balance of citrus and sweet, but once it hit the palate, it was a bit hot and very tannic. The taste was pleasant, but the tannic nature of it was very distracting and it had this sort of distracting citrus pith bitterness.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

2.0,"I really like what the Arran distillery is doing, but they missed the boat on this one. It is a unbalanced over sweet short delivery with a weird finish that is unpleasant. It hurts me because I wanted to like this. The14 and the 18 are amazing and I have had other NAS Arran expressions that are fantastic."

Palate: interesting and varied mix of flavours. Orange peel, oak little salt and a bit of malt.

Medium finish"

4.5,"Great flavor. Nice, light and peaty taste but with a good sweet backdrop. Can definitely taste the strawberry jam."
4.0,"Nose: Rich oaky sweetness. A gentleman's study where more than a little port has spilled onto the furniture over the years. Leather chairs, tobacco, walnut oil, vanilla, orange, raspberry, black cherry, caramel  After the first sip, the palate contributes aromas and the nose reveals fruit compote, sherry, espresso and oak. With time the nose gains a more delicate fragrant note. Wonderful.

Palate: A rich, mildly warm , restrained sweet arrival of impeccable breeding. A little ginger, dried fruits, orange oil, raisins, sultanas, muscatels. Berries of every type, milk chocolate, baked apples with cinnamon. The texture is awesome - just to the softly silken and syrupy side of oily (drool).

Finish: Medium/long. Sweet initially with fruity notes, but sliding gracefully into a demi-sec chocolate and grape finish. Masterful, with a drying late finish.

Another cracking good cask finish from Arran. I don't know what else I can add, it's all in the tasting notes. Very good whisky indeed (tasted from a 30ml sample).

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"
