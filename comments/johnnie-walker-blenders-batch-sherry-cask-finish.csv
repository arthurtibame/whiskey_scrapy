3.5,"I was eager to get my hands on this expression since it intrigued me to see a sherried JW. Actually it was pretty good for the ""almost nothing"" price that they ask for it, and it was an interesting dram since the nose its actually not sherried at all. 

Bottled at 40%abv 

On the nose this one was maritime. Salt, Strawberry, Heather, laundry detergent, Sandy
Beach. Actually pretty interesting.

On the palate sherry appeared, a sherried sweetness, some grape juice and ginger. The aftertaste was salty and coastal. Reminds me of some sherried islay's whiskies. 

Not complex at all, easy drinkable, interesting without changing my life, i give this dram a 72 over 100."

5.0,"A superb nose! Madeira, prunes, tasty peat, dried fruit. The taste have a home ciocolate with a sherried note,  dried fruit, ginger, also prunes. The finish have also dried fuits, smoky prunes. I think that the best description of this whisky is smoky prunes flavour with a tint of peat and ginger."
