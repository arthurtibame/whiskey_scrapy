4.5,"One Eight’s first run of blending their 2 yr old house made rye with their 14 yr old sourced bourbon. 

Nose: orange, cherry, ethanol
Palate: Oak, spice, cherry coke, pecan, toasted nuts, cereal, grapefruit
Finish: vanilla pudding, vegetable, caramel, baking chocolate

The rye spice comes through nicely and the finish lingers for a while with a wonderful mix of flavors. The corn distillate adds a fire to the nose, diluting with a little water tamps that down and really boosts the flavors."
