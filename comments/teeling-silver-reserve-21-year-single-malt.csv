null,This is a double distilled malt from the Bushmills distillery not the Cooley distillery. it was distilled by then master distiller Frank McHardy. It was an experimental single malt that was never released due not fitting into Bushmills ethos.

It really stands up on the palate. Right in the middle, BANG fruit. What I couldn't do though is say exactly which fruit, but it was tropical and closest I could guess was pineapple. So interesting with that loud fruit note in the middle that invites you to keep sipping. I like interesting and enjoyed this one for sure. Is limited edition and $200 as of now - Dog bought a bottle after the tasting so hopefully get to sample it again with him"
