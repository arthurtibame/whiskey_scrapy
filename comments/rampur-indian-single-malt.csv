2.0,"I had a pour of this at a Diwali party this evening.  Open bar, sitting next to a Balvenie 12, Paul John, and a Talisker 10.  Talisker 10 was undoubtedly the best in the lineup, but I’ve never even heard of this one...so why not, might as well give it a spin.  

At this point, Amrut is the de facto standard whiskey out of India, followed next by Paul John.  But, Rampur...never heard of it.  Apparently, it’s out of the subcontinent’s oldest distillery called Radico Khaitan from Uttar Pradesh.  What’s interesting is that Uttar Pradesh’s climate is totally different than Amrut’s Bangalore and Paul John Goa.  Bangalore is very Texas like; Goa is more Hawaiian type.  While Uttar Pradesh has chilly winters and dry hot summers.  So...maybe more like Utah / Colorado.  I’d expect less wood interaction than the blistering Bangalore or Goan heat.  

Anyway—-tasting this is very much like a Dalwinnie.  Honey, cereals, light.  It lacks the muscle of Amrut...and the complexity.  Very mild and restrained.  Maybe a good foray into Indian whiskey, but not something I’d buy anytime soon.  Instead, stick with Amrut, or if you want less horsepower, Paul John.  Buy, pour, or bust...solid bust."

4.0,"Very fruity nose, almost like plum wine. On the palate, it has a mildly sweet flavor with not as much fruitiness as you would expect from the nose. The finish is medium to long. The taste is not as strong as you would expect which in this case is a good thing as it would be a major “sherry bomb”. It’s also one the few whiskeys that pairs well with food, bonus!"
5.0,Very good. Smooth and spicy with notes of tropical fruits and vanilla

5.0,"Hands down the most floral whiskey I have come across.
So I got a bottle of it just so I could discover how it would taste with ice, water, club soda, tonic, honey liquor, red bull, coke and (sorry mom) milk. It’s almost on the border with brandy (or cognac) because of its fruitiness which I personally do not like much but when mixed that after taste becomes negligible.
I highly recommend it for at least tasting if not buying."

3.75,A new take on single malt. The finish is not incredibly long but the tropical flavoured nose and taste is amazing. Could probably benefit from further aging. Well done!

3.75,"Harsh front, smooth end. Floral"
3.75,"Golden straw in color. Lychee fruit dominates the nose along with hints of mandarin oranges and flower petals. In the flavor profile, there’s not quite as much going on as the nose would suggest...but it still doesn’t disappoint. Lychee and canned pears stand at attention with a nice, albeit subtle, oaky finish. A drop of water adds more depth to the fruit and floral aromas and some heft to the mouthfeel. This guy clocked in as Whisky Advocate’s #5 whiskey of the year in 2017, and it’s not hard to see why. In a blind taste test, the uniqueness of this pour must’ve stood out in a huge way. Rampur is a fun bottle to have in your library."
