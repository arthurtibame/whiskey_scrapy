2.5,"Wolfburn tasting evening at The Oak Barrel, Sydney, May 30th 2019: Whisky #6

Nose: The signature distillery fruity/floral character is here but it's distant and obscured by uninteresting dark fruit aromas. There's also a taint like old mouldy laundry. The sherry character here could almost be described as an ""oloroso stain"", being dark, woody and stale.

Palate: An attack that veers disturbingly towards dry sourness. What the hell is going on here? A dry and dark fruity development that devolves into a melange of discombobulated sherry and oak notes and develops the unpleasant aroma of rubber tires. The texture is good but the rest of the palate experience is plain confused.

Finish: Medium. Fruit fading into a cereal after-image and a bitterish aftertaste.

Have you ever had wet woolen socks that you've draped over a heater or in front of the fire to dry and then left too long? That's the aroma of this whisky - pungent damp woolliness, almost scorched, with a hint of sweaty feet.

I have to rate this as the first poor Wolfburn I've tasted. It was apparently a one-off single cask bottling from Cask 131 (a 250 litre ex-oloroso hogshead) that yielded 280 bottles. It was commissioned by Bibendum Bar in Sydney and is exclusive to them.

It does at least have the saving grace of proving that, without a doubt, Wolfburn spirit should never leave the distillery without at least some time spent in a bourbon cask. 100% oloroso does not suit this whisky (100% PX may, however).
For some folks at the tasting this was a highlight but I wouldn't want to buy another taste, let alone a bottle - particularly not at the asking price.

""Average"" : 2.5 stars"
