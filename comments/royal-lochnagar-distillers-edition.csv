3.0,"Good but I wanted a lot more from this. Based on the description, I thought it would be fuller and more complex. Not a bottle I’d buy (though I adore the 12)"
3.25,"Nose: Dominant apricot and peach aromas supported by honey, barley sugar, red grape juice, malt extract and sandalwood. There is the fragrance of violets that becomes more noticeable over time and an occasional whiff of something vaguely like smoke (but it's most likely barrel char). [The dried-glass aroma is heavy caramelized white sugar].

Palate: The arrival is soft, very relaxed and inviting. Sweet malty and dried fruit flavours (particularly muscatel grapes and sultanas), caramel and milk chocolate on the development. There's also a jammy flavour a bit like fruity jelly beans! The texture is creamy and satisfying and the profile is both sweet and mildly tannic.

Finish: Medium/short. A sweet dried fruit and grape aftertaste with a hint of sandalwood and oak tannin.

Royal Lochnagar used to release the Distiller's Edition at regular intervals, always with a period of finishing in ex-muscat casks, and they were remarkably consistent.  However after the 2000/2012 batch it disappeared entirely with no explanation forthcoming from Diagio. Were they no longer able to source the required casks?  Who knows. This tasting is from a bottle from batch RL/98-10U, casked in 1998 and bottled in 2011, which was the second-last batch.

It's a sweet, soft and well rounded whisky that is eminently approachable but not simplistic. It's also excellent as an after-dinner dessert dram, and pairs particularly well with dried fruits and soft cheese. There is a resemblance to Balvenie 12 Doublewood, but this whisky is sweeter and more floral in character.  At one time it was my preferred dram to offer novices.

When first poured, the whisky expresses a pungent leather and malty character but this quickly dissipates and it becomes increasingly sweet and soft over time.  The finishing was handled adroitly and does not dominate the profile. At heart this is a dry, almost waxy, east-highland style of whisky but the presence of the fortified wine here contributes a finely-calculated balancing sweetness.

Do not add water - it is completely unnecessary.

3.0,Vanilla and with a touch of oloroso that lingers on the sides of your tongue. Refreshing and light. A bit of oak but not overpowering. Nothing incredibly memorable though.
