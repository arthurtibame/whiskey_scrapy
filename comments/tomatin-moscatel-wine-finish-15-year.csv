4.75,"I got to try this at a Tomatin tasting and it was my favorite between the 12, 14, 18, and cask strength. You can definitely taste the flavors left from the moscatel casks. 

The nose isn’t as sweet as wine but you can smell the flowers and nuts similar to a glass of moscato. The palate is less harsh than the 12 and 14 year Tomatin offerings, and sweeter with notes of flowers, nuts, and dark chocolate. The sweetness begins to fade during the finish while some spices emerge. 

This is a really great scotch that I was lucky to taste as I probably wouldn’t buy it for the $100/bottle they want for this exclusive bottling."

5.0,"Tried this in a flight alongside Glenfiddich Project XX, Strathill 25, Macallan Edition 2, Bruichladdich Black Art 5.1 1992 24 year, this, and Springbank 20 Rum Cask. This was ranked number 2 of the night with a bright and vibrant flavor profile of white and dark chocolate, cantaloupe, melon, oranges, vanilla, and tropical fruit."
