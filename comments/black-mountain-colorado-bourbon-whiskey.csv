3.5,"I had the opportunity to taste this one with a couple of friends who had a sample box of many whiskies. 

This is a french whisky. It tells the story about the WILD BOAR-WOLF. Yep, half Wild Boar and half Wolf, this mystical animal lurks the Black Mountain were this whisky came from. There is actually a video of a guy trying to find it. Pretty cool stuff.

Bottled at 45%abv, pale straw color.

On the nose: Vanilla, Pepper, Cake, lemon, fresh forest. Not the best aroma in town, mostly sweet and citric... cheap.

On the palate it is actually a good dram. Creamy, with a slight peat, but gets a little watery and then oily. 

Aftertaste is very interesting because it feels like grain whisky but peated. Ashy but creamy. 

Overall this is an interesting dram, nothing to die for, but worth a try. 78 over 100, i could have given it at least the 80 points for the cool story."
4.0,"Appearance: This special bourbon had a polished brass color, with very thin viscous legs that cloyed for ones approval.

Nose: The dusty yet welcoming nose boasted notes of dusty corn, aspen dust, dry grass, honey crisp apple, honey, caramel, and vanillins.

Taste: The bold palate had a chalky mouthfeel, with notes of plum, cherry, caramel, vanilla, and black tea, and barrel spice.

Finish: The bourbon had a dry lingering bitter finish.

Thoughts: So this special release was made by Distillery 291 as a gift for Black Bear in Green Mountain Falls when it opened as a bourbon bar (pre-distillery). For those who know 291’s style, one can definitely see the family resemblance, however in a side by side comparison this bourbon is lighter in color and more mellow in flavor to 291’s staple bourbon. I really like this bourbon and wish it was available to the masses. Thanks 291 for making it and thanks Black Bear for sharing with me! Cheers!"
