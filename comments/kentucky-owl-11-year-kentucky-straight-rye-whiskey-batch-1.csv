null,"Nose is strong cherry then oak. As the two mix in the middle it’s just lovely. The palate is still difficult to me to describe, but it’s kind of brown sugar (?) and licorice (?) up front, then the oak comes closing back in on the back end. I’m not usually a huge oak fan, but this is just done so damn well."

5.0,"Nose: Strawberry French toast syrup 

Palate: Oily Tootsie rolls, apple juice, light Carmel, 

Finish - Oak, Coates mouth, leaves you tonguing the inside of your cheeks, Seems authentically aged and UNCUT,  the viscosity is like I’d imagine old Dusty’s that we can’t find/ afford might taste. 

This Rye is a FOMO favorite right now and its profits at $150 a bottle are probably affording Yuri Shefler another 5 star dingy for his yacht.. witch will be will be nice if we crash , Yuri- call me📞 let’s do lunch! 

I dig it, it’s really nice and I hope it sets a bar for some of the other major rye/ bourbon companies."

5.0,"NOSE - Cherry, burnt sugars, rich dark honey, baked caramel apples

PALATE - cherry pie filling, spiced cinnamon apples, honey, sweet malt

FINISH - warm spices, pleasant heat, keeps you coming back for more.

Folks, this might be my favorite rye whiskey of all time. Incredible and unique flavor, as in “wow this is what a rye whiskey ought to taste like!”

If you get a chance, spend the $$$ and buy!"

In fact, the next week between me and my friends we restocked with 4 more bottles"

This feels more like mindfulness than a drink. I felt like a thick pacific northwest fog wrapped around a horizon of pine trees. They were piercing me but it felt like partnership, not pain.

If The Buddha had a favorite rye. I think this would be it, with defining characteristics of presence, contemplation, connectedness, and tranquility."

It’s a good choice if you don’t have anything like it in your collection and can find near the bottom of its price range, but you don’t need it if you already have a teenage rye on hand."

4.0,"Nose - (w/o water) Vanilla, dark butterscotch, herbal rye spice, dark caramel, light fruit, strawberry/cherry (w/ water) not much change, but sweet mint comes out.

Taste - (w/o water) Spicy sweet cinnamon, dark butterscotch, light herbal/sweet mint, strawberry fruity oak (w/ water) More vanilla, butterscotch, more sweet mint, herbal spice

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering cinnamon heat/tingle, sweet mint/herbal sweetness, light tannic oak, drying (w/ water) Lingering tannic fruity sweet mint, butterscotch

Score - 83/100

Final Thoughts - This was quite tasty. Nice mix of rye spice and dark caramel/butterscotch flavors. Does well with a tiny bit of water in that it doesn't really change the flavors much, but softens up the ethanol burn and mellows out the heat nicely. It's got a lot going for it as a rye, but the only downfall I see is that it has a super long finish, but sadly it's an almost overly sweet mint sweetness that borders on splenda sweet territory.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - Not at the current prices. This bottle at most should be in the $70-80 range."

Offhand, I can’t name a better rye.  I enjoyed this more than BTAC Thomas Handy.  I only hope batch 2 is as good as batch 1."

4.25,"Dark copper in color and a rich, dark, fruity nose with some obvious heat. There’s even some old wood on the nose if you work at it hard enough. Whatever it is, the aroma seems to be setting me up for a sumptuous treat.
First taste is sweet and hot with a nice long burn. There’s plenty of wood to be had on the backend (😟I know...but the statement is still valid).
My nose wanted it to be a tad thicker and oilier, but no complaints here. Every sip gets progressively better as it settles down. 
As expected, a few drops of water adds fruit characteristics (especially citrus notes at the back/top of my mouth) and a creamier mouthfeel. Surprisingly though, the pleasant burn is still strong and steady. 4.27."

I was lucky enough to try this at a tasting event with many other quality bourbons.  I think if you went into this blind, you would not be as impressed as you otherwise might be by the air of mystique normally around this. It's definitely good, but it shouldn't have the reputation it does."

5.0,"Potent nose of cherry cola, cinnamon, annise, birch, plenty of toasted oak notes, citrus peel, brown sugar, toasted marshmallow, to name a few. The complexity of the nose is intoxicating, i almost didn't want to taste it out of fear the palate would be a let down...
The palate is no let down. Cherries, sweet oak, toasted marshmallow, smoke and charcoal, some of those classic cola roots, spices, and extracts, mouth-coating but not cloying and a finish that lingers for minutes.

Gotta put this one up there as a top 5 rye because of the depth and expressiveness of the blend. I hear the later batches were not as good, glad I got to snag this one when I did. 
If you can find it and its not exorbitantly expensive, I would highly recommend this"
