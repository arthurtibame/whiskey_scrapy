5.0,"I totally recommend buying this bottle. It’s one of the most complex and exhilarating whiskeys I’v tasted to date m - it’s lightly Smokey but the smoke is unlike ardbeg, talisker, or laphroaig- it’s subtle and distant. The excitement comes with the white peppery spice and fruitiness on the back end - it ramps up like no other. After sipping caol ila you realize that it’s the exciting malt added into Johnny Walker. Cheers!"
4.0,So nice and rich. Great end-of-the-night dram for me

3.75,Rich spicy caramel salt
3.5,"Neat: 
Nose: Very shy on the initial nose. There is a hint of barley and vanilla but that's basically it.
Palate: Big arrival with then toasted barley that takes you on a journey with some salt, big honey notes and certain sour notes. The finish is long, very pleasant and has an oaky butter quality to it.

With water:
Nose: The whisky opens up with a splash if water. Some floral and herbal notes appear together with a little caramel smell. 
Palate: The taste stays very much in tact but gains in volume and punch. There is just a little smokiness coming through the mid palate and a dryness usually associated with peated whiskys. 

If you add more water the whiskys loses some of its complexity, gets sweeter but also more alcoholic. In summary it gets younger the more water you add. 

In summary: Its a well matured bourbon CS whisky. It tolerates quite some water but probably has its sweet spot around 50% ABV where both nose and palate are interesting. I miss the bold honey notes from previous expressions but still nice to play with. (82/100)
The price is a little bit too high. I prefer the Loch Lomond 17 much more."

3.75,"OK finishing my stock of the unpeated Caol Ila's - until I find more.  

Nose - this one is complex.  it's the salted caramels and vanilla's for sure.  But there's something else going on.  I get some fruity character which the box has me convinced now is strawberry.  Oak is only on the very very back end and so subtle.  

Taste - Berries, soft sweetness, intense, man.  Lets go in for another taste. It's strawberries, salt, and a sweet base that is like a toasted neutral bready note.  Water brings forward some vanilla and cream but I'm still missing something on the sweet front.  This drinks far under the 59.8% abv while still having so much intense flavor and such a creamy mouth feel.  

Caol Ila 18 is still a bold and over powering high abv dram like the 15, but it's such a nicer and softer and just better whisky.  None of these Caol Ila's are overly complex but instead are over whelming in their intensity and down right great flavors.  The 18 uses just american oak vs the 15 using american and european.  Perhaps that's what keeps this one so much more enjoyable vs the overly harsh notes of the 15. 

I'd like more complexity here or just a better overall profile, but none the less great whisky.  3.75 due to how high quality this is.  the price at 125 is ideal given 18 years and cask strength while being clearly not the highest quality casks and being a bit of an experiment.  I will buy another if they're around for some time."
4.5,"Bought this bottle on the curious thought of ""Caol Ila... unpeated?"" ... what a winning choice! Cask strength 59%+ and flavor for days. Nose and taste both have strong spice and bite, but I still drink half neat and the letter half with a teaspoon of water. opens up a buttery nose with strawberry and citrus and on the taste brings out a honey background"

5.0,"Popping the stopper the aroma was quiet.

On the nose I only found a few things but interesting and unique - clover honey, mint, cut hay, wet rocks, and salt.

The Mouth - a quiet buttered prologue steadily boiling into a salty sweet intensity and a rapidly drying mouthfeel. Brine takes over and a cloud of steam smoke and ash appear with a finish of vanilla and some pear aroma and hint of sour apple or lychee. 

Truly remarkable although no words will do - favorite dram of they year for me. An instant favorite. Can’t wait to blend this to see what character it will bring to other bottles in my collection!"

3.0,"Nose - (w/o water) Bit hot, sharp sweet apple juice, honey (w/ water) less heat, but otherwise the same

Taste - (w/o water) Bit thin, drying mouthfeel, white pepper heat, dark fruity honey (w/ water) Less drying, more balanced dark honey, more apple notes

Finish - (w/o water) Mouth drying, dark honey, white pepper heat (w/ water) Less drying, light heat, fruity honey

Score - 75/100

Final Thoughts - As I expected, it's a slightly better version of their standard peated 12 year offering. This is more down my alley as it's unpeated, but it's still very much one-dimensional although the extra 6 years is apparent in that it has a lot better mouthfeel. It feels like the sweetness is more refined, a bit darker honey, but still very one-dimensional.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

4.0,"Caol Ila without peat - can that work? To fully enjoy this 18-year-old 'Unpeated Style', you need 3 things: time, water and perseverance. Vibrant and dense, the nose features pastries, lime juice and fresh sea air with a salty-mineral edge. With water, sour and biscuity notes intensify. On the palate, the complex flavor profile continues with apricots, white pepper and herbal spiciness. Full-bodied, oily and slightly dry, the medium finish fades with crisp lemons, salted nuts and a touch of menthol. An extremely rewarding Islay malt, despite its lack of peat.

RATING: 4.0/5.0 stars ≙ 87 pts → FIRST-CLASS"

4.25,"Bewildering to find yourself with a Caol Ila with such a gentle, herbaceous and fruity nose. Warm and inviting, with vanilla cream cake, fruit (mango, peach, kiwi), fresh flowers, cut grass. Slight hint of wet wood in the background.
If you couldn't feel it on the nose, on the palate the alcoholic power is explosive, a cannonade of burning shortcrust pastry which you have to get used to, giving space just to the citrus notes with vanilla and cinnamon. Generally refractory to the addition of water, I find myself having to do it for the really important aggressiveness of alcohol, being rewarded by a broadening of the aromatic horizon, with the release of ripe fruit (peach and banana), malt, custard and licorice. There is an impression, really little more than an impression, of peat in the background.
Long finish, with cream cake, licorice, wood and always that idea of ​​peat.
If it weren't for the uncentered alcoholic content, I would have given it a few more points: if the bottler chooses a certain alcoholic strength for their own whisky, that's what I have to deal with to understand whether or not it meets my taste, having to add water for me is a malus.
However, it remains an unusual and pleasant drink, a ""fake highlander"" who cannot completely hide its true identity."
