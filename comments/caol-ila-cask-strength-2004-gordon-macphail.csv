5.0,"love this single malt. one of the best caol ila's i've tasted to date. deceptively smooth, even without a touch of water. they picked a good one..."
4.0,"Not as smokey as an Ardbeg in my view.
I like to drink all my whiskey with a touch of cold water, however with this one you MUST, in my opinion, drink it with a touch of cold water to enjoy its flavours, otherwise you just lose all the flavours and perfumes in its strenght"
