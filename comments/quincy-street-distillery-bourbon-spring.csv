5.0,"This 'baby' bourbon kicks like a mule, in all the right ways. Absolutely fantastic input for any cocktail needing a lil' help from the Whiskey section.

With smokey notes that fade into a smooth caramel, this is fantastic for any cocktails that aren't afraid of whiskey notes that enhance, rather than overpower."
null,This is different than any bourbon I have ever tasted.  I love the bold flavors of oak and caramel.  This bourbon would be terrific in an Old Fashioned.
5.0,Best of the young whiskeys the midwest is putting out. A little smokey from the barrel and a lot of vanilla.
