3.0,"More sweetness and vanilla than its counterpart (the 4 year) with some tannins to give it some sharpness. A very buttery texture, indicative of the second barrelling. The fruitiness present in the 4-year takes a few steps forward in this one. Still a little lighter and sweeter than what I prefer, with a chemical heat on the finish that I'm nt necessarily jumping for joy over. Still a more-than-decent bottle, just with a less-than-decent price."

4.5,Delicious taste. Smooth. Light whiskey but has that aftertaste that leaves you wanting for more.

3.0,"More hot than the 4-year, but with much more oak and complexity. I'll probably buy a bottle of this and mix it 50/50 with the 4 year and see how that goes to try and get the best of both worlds."

3.5,"A lovely craft effort from Portland Oregon. Thanks @PBMichiganWolverine for the sample!  As mentioned in his review, if you like a whiskey that's sweet with a nice vanilla note, you'll like this Burnside.  And personally, I do like a sweet, vanilla whiskey.

But sweet vanilla alone is hardly memorable.  Fortunately, this whiskey brings some distinction in the form of a slight oak dryness similar to the wood note I often find in Speyside whiskys.  This is only the second garryana-aged whiskey I've tasted, with the first being Westland Garryana.  With the Westland, I found the garryana wood note to be too sharp.  With the Burnside, the unique garryana taste is more mild, and is a strong complement to the whiskey. 

This is not a complex dram, and it's not full of classic bourbon notes outside of the vanilla.  In fact, tasted blind, I might have pegged it as a wheat whiskey.  But ultimately, it's very pleasant, easy drinking and enjoyable."
3.0,"It’s been a while since I’ve actually opened a new bottle.  An endless trough of samples have kept me occupied.  So, tonight it’s this Oregon bourbon made by Eastside Distilling out of Portland.  Now, I’m going to be a bit biased in this review.  I picked this bottle up while I was on vacation in Oregon.  To me, Oregon will be these amazing vistas of rugged coastlines and dark green pine forests.  And Portland is ingrained in my mind as this uber hippy town with an amazing food truck scene.  

This one here is a sourced bourbon, matured in Garryana oak, which is native to the Pacific Northwest.  That oak is sponge like, which adds an extra oomph of vanilla and spice.  On the nose, I immediately get vanilla beans.  Like the real ones grown in Madagascar and absurdly priced in Whole Paycheck, aka Whole Foods.  Palette is all vanilla, with a finish of a bit of oak.  

The Garryana imparts a real dessert like treat to this.  I’m actually surprised how the Garryana made this one almost like vanilla ice cream, while the same oak used at Westland imparts a more spicy flavor.   

If you like your bourbon sweet and extra-vanilla, this is right up your alley ."
3.5,"On ice, way better. Too Hot when you drink it straight."

2.5,"I really like Trail's End, which is another bourbon finished with Oregon oak.  For the Burnside Bourbon, I think it's a little younger and a maybe a little too oaky for my taste.  Caramel, heavy wood notes, and a little too rough on the finish."
3.0,"A bit bland. No real strong flavors.  Smells sweet with a touch of vanilla.  The color of light straw. The taste is a non descript bourbon, pleasant.  Would make a great mixer."

3.0,"Booze at first then syrup and orange peel on the nose. The more I’m sipping the more I’m tasting 50/50 bar, which is alright by me. Abrupt finish, but a charming little dram. Long live the spirits of Oregon!"
