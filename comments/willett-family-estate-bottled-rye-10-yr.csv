4.25,"A lot more oak and spice than expected, but still the classic Willett rye deliciousness"

5.0,Intense rye and oak flavors. The absolute quintessential flavor of rye. Smooth and just the right amount of sweetness. Flavors of cookie dough and tobacco.

4.0,"Small Batch, ten years, 115 proof, released 2019. Smells like Sprite. Honey initially on the palate, then, balance. Slightly floral. Lingering spice, a decently long finish. Very good. 2/22/19"

4.75,"Neat, duh
Glencairn Copita

N: cinnamon raisin toast with some hints of banana 
P: Spice bomb! This hits the front of the palate like a clump of cinnamon sugar that didn't get mixed into the butter. You taste both the buttery richness but that sugar and spice is in your face. Phenomenal!
F: Spicy with that tail of perfect oak."
4.5,Nicely split vanilla/honey rye followed by hints of maple syrup and molasses. Very spicy rye finish with salinity. Rich and oily. Less heat than the ABV suggests. Creative and excellent.

4.5,"I was fortunate enough to have multiple pours of this dram today and boy let me tell you it doesn't disappoint. First let's examine what's in the bottle. This is a sourced Kentucky Rye that is bottled at Cask Strength without chill filtration. It's ridiculously allocated and finding one this old is very rare these days. Let's jump to the tasting:

The first this to note with this Rye is it needs air and plenty of it. When first cracked and sampled it was a spice bomb and other notes were difficult to pull. However after giving it 10-15 mins of air it opened up wonderfully! Thick and viscous with an array banking spices, toffee, vanilla and orange peel. Cocoa and oak lead the mid palette to a very long oak, pepper and cherry driven finish. Sublime. A few drops of water reveals a chocolate covered orange note and more dried fruits. 

All in all this really is a wonderful dram that was a treat to sample! Cheers all and TGIF"
4.0,"Oak, banana, butterscotch and brown sugar on the nose.
Creamy, almost frothy mouthfeel with plenty of heat on the backend.
Tons of wet oak in the flavor profile with a drier-than-expected finish. A little bit of white pepper comes through upon further tasting.
