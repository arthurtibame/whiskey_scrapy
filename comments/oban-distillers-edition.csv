4.0,"Fresh, bland sherry, smooth with sweet aromatic finish"
4.75,"This is the good stuff. So enjoyably complex. Super sweet nose, peach, caramel and sweet cherry. The taste completely twists though, tart and tangy apples and cherries hits hard at the front, but then comes a salty, briny, and light peat flavor that really lingers even after finishing. The best part is the dryness that is there throughout the taste. Like a Tempranillo wine dry that helps the flavor flow from tang to salty peat."

4.0,"$100 - Michigan. Nose (Neat): Vanilla, floral, medium smoke and oak. Smooth sweet smell without any sharpness or bite to the nose. Palate (Neat): Medium alcohol burn on first sip. Starts with notes of caramel, smooth smoke and slight nectarine. Fades to slightly salted caramel and then floral honey. Really makes my mouth water after every sip. This scotch closely resembles a smooth single barrel bourbon.  Would recommend this to a bourbon lover."

5.0,"I had this at my cousin's place this evening.   I'm a fan of Oban, which is really such an all-rounder that it fails to disappoint at all.  It really appeals to the  masses.  This takes it a step further.  The double maturation makes this more complex, sweeter, and richer.  I'd buy a bottle of this---really well made.  Nose is sweet, almost rum like.  Taste is nutty, rich.  Like sweet cashews and peanut brittle.  A bit salty, tangy, but also sweet.   Considering it's priced around $80, it's really well worth it."

4.0,"Great whisky but not my favorite. This is a full bodied whisky that has lots of subtle complexity where nothing particularly stands out. The nose has sea salt, lemon/orange zest and light honey. Its feel is initially smooth with the heat showing a few seconds in. The palate continues to present salty bitterness matched with the orange zest tanginess and honey sweetness. Spices like white pepper appear in the finish accompanied by the hint of charred oak.
  Verdict: Personally I prefer something a little bolder but they have gone for a specific style and I think this is fairly unique. At $140 AUD I don't think I'll buy another bottle but I will definitely try to make this one last a while and wouldn’t shy away from it in a bar."

4.0,"Nose - Apple/pear malt, hint of saline, buttery/nutty/fruity sherry influence, macadamia nuts.

Taste - Peppery lightly salty apple/pear malt, buttery/oily mouthfeel, lighty sweet nut butter, blanched almonds, flamed orange zest, light strawberry/raspberry.

Finish - Lingering peppery spice, light brine, very very faint smoke, light apple peel/stem fruity bitterness, lightly drying, berry pear cider sweet tingle.

Score - 87/100

Final Thoughts - This is a bit interesting in that there is a very subtle sherry influence but I also got quite a bit of sweet nutty notes out of it as well. I keep on telling myself that I need to get more acquainted with the different types of sherry, but I've heard that some sherrys have a sweet nutty taste to them and that's a large part of what I get out of this one. That being said, this is definitely an interesting dram. Fantastic on the nose, tasty on the palate but it's got this weird complex combination that just doesn't exactly do it for me. It's very tasty but I don't think it's something I think I'd ever regularly reach for."

5.0,"Notes for Oban Distiller’s Edition - distilled 2003, bottled in 2017.

Honey colored. Light bodied with a silky mouthfeel.

Nose: dates and honey, a hint of sea salt like a sea breeze. Orange rind and pear accent the aroma. A wisp of smoke passes by at the end. 

Palate: rich sweetness from dates and honey at the front. Fruitiness brightens the whisky through the middle with citrus from oranges and pears. A mild smoke rises toward the end. 

The finish is short and sweet leaving a mouthwatering taste of dates and honey accented by bright citrus and maple syrup. 

Incredibly smooth and balanced. It’s subtle but also extremely rich and sweet while maintaining mild smoke and sea salt profiles behind the fruit basket of flavor on display.

I’d give this 4.7/5 or 5/5 on here. I like it better than Oban 14 and Oban Little Bay, though I enjoy both of those quite a bit. This whisky is fuller and richer than 14 but not as “loud” as Little Bay, and there’s a lot of depth to the character of this whisky."
5.0,"Color: Darker honey 

Nose: Dates, hint of a sea breeze, honey, orange rind and some pear. Subtle and very balanced with faint smoke at the end. 

Palate:  Light bodied with silky mouthfeel. Dates and honey lead the way. Topped off with a short and sweet pleasant finish with lingering honey, dates and some maple with bright citrus. 

Very smooth and balanced till the end."

3.5,"Scotland, September 2017. (from notes).

Nose: Similar to the 14 year expression but larger, richer and smoother. Wisps of hefty but subtle smoke thread around and there is a more mellow fruitiness.

Palate: Again, similar to the 14 year but with greater caramel and malt, which gives it a creamy mouthfeel. Some fragrant herbal notes, almost floral. Hazelnuts and peanuts.

Finish: Medium, with cereal and faint smoke. Adding water reveals spice notes that are otherwise very much in the background and brings out the smoke and salt.

A good single malt that is very much the 14 year dialed up a couple of notches in every respect.

“Good” : 3.5 stars"

4.0,"The Diageo Distiller's Edition line of cask matured malts has yet to disappoint me, and this is no exception. The standard bottling of Oban is always reliably pleasant - mellow citrus, hint of sea breeze, creamy maltiness, hint of very distant smoke in the background to add a bit of complexity. It was a smart move to meld this with a Fino sherry cask; the salty, dry, nutty, slightly funky-sweet bite of Fino goes well with the generally mild, lightly fruity Oban house style. On the nose is a more pronounced salty note than in the standard bottling, with candied orange peel and lemon, a dry maltiness, and a creamy, sweet fruitiness. The mouth is equally complex, as salty, fruity-sweet, and savory herbal tones compete with each other, but in the most harmonious of ways. It's like tug-of-war, but performed by Cirque de Soleil. The finish is moderately long and winds up with a bit of dry malt, the faintest hint of smoke, and a bit of slightly astringent wood. This isn't quite the marvel that the Talisker or Lagavulin DEs are, but then again, Oban's normal bottlings aren't (for me) as impressive as the standard entries from aforementioned distilleries, either. On its own merits, this is still a great dram and worth seeking out."

The coppery color is enticing, though I wonder if it’s artificial. The nose is delightful. Citrus leaves, cinnamon, glazed peaches, vanilla, and a complicated earthiness. The palate is unique. The taste of fruitcake accompanies the peach and cinnamon notes. Yet it is also meaty, sweet and mouthwatering like capicola. All of the elements one could hope for in a good meal show up here. But the finish — the finish! — is magnificent. It is drying and spicy and warms all the way to the chest. A salty burn rises up the nasal passage and fades to a sweet aftertaste. A wonderful and unexpected gift, a wonderful and unexpected single malt."

4.25,"Diageo's Distiller's Edition series takes their Classic Malt Range offerings and puts them in sherry casks for an additional 6 months. So for this one, it's the Oban 14 +6 months in sherry. I'm a fan of the latter, and I loved what those 6 months did for the Lag 16. This should be a good one.

This is the 2018 Edition.

Nose: Classic Oban. Light whiff of smoke is detectable. Heavy on the honey, vanilla, and apple. Distinct soapy note that I associate with Oban. The sherry influence is minimal, though I do get a bit of strawberry jam if I search for it. Relatively light but solid nose nonetheless.

Came back to this months later and I've got to say, the nose is much vibrant. Additional notes of pear, apricot, honeydew, cantalope, marshmallow, and custard. I now think it is the most interesting part of the whisky.

Palate: Similar to the nose but gets it up a notch. It's still heavy on the vanilla, honey, and apple. This is followed by honeydew, cherry, roasted almond, and toffee. Here, Oban's coastal quality becomes more pronounced. The soapiness is now coupled with a noticeable saline characteristic. Just a puff of smoke. Once again, the sherry influence is in the background. It's cherry and maybe some dark grape. All good things here. I'm a big fan of the honeydew note. Can't say I've picked it up anywhere else.

Finish: Respectable for 43 ABV. It's a cross between fruity sweetness coming in the form of cherry, dark grape, and red apple, and a spicy oak and cinnamon punch. The smoke is a bit more prominent here, and the sherry influence shines at this point.

Overall, it's good stuff. It won't blow you away or change your perception of Single Malt Whisky. But it does bat well above average from start to finish. It's an easy-going dram that's just complex enough to command your attention. Perfect for a summer evening.

Initially, I passed on this one due to price. My local liquor store had this pegged at a hefty $98. However, when this went on sale for $75, I had to pull the trigger. Well worth the money. So far these Diageo Distillers Editions have done me well. Looking forward to trying the rest of the lineup. As for the Oban DE, I'll say 4 stars flat. Well done.

Came back to this months later and time has really done this well. Bumped up to 4.25."
