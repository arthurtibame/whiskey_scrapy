4.0,"Smells like dusty corn or grain. Like a freshly opened sack of chicken scratch. Thats is a good thing.  Has flavors of pecan shell, raisins and honey.  Just wish it was a higher proof. But its only $16."

4.0,The aroma is what you get when you unzip the paper and string top of a sack of chicken laying mash and the powdery aroma of grain dust wafts out. Comforting and earthy. Takes me back to when i lived on an orchard and had chickens.  Not a lot of sweetness or alcohol burn. The taste is dusty grainy as well in a delicious way. Also some graham cracker in the finish.
