4.5,"Nose: A fruity blend of citrus and apples. Smokey and malty. Leathery? Smells like the sea which is appropriate.

Palate: Fruitiness blending with smokiness as expected. Saltiness coming along with hints of caramel.

Finish: Lingering smokey flavor. More of the saltiness as well. Slightly fruity on its way out.

Overall Thoughts: I am very comfortable with this one. It’s soothing and tastes like home seeing as I grew up just minutes from the ocean. However, I’ve had Talisker whiskies before and they’re excellent, but I wouldn’t consider this to be their best. But seeing as it’s for the GoT collection, it’s great."

4.5,"Great whisky from Talisker! Briny, smoky, and delicious."
4.0,"Lots of salty brine, sweet smoke, and a little spicyness. Really good neat, and really nice chilled. But don't add too much ice because it'll drown out the flavor fairly quickly. 

Hard to find in Florida so I overpaid a bit (70$) but still glad I tried this!  I like it more than the House Lannister Lagavulin (which I did really like)."

4.0,"Rich, peaty nose and a bold, zesty flavor. Peat level is somewhere near Lagavulin 16."
4.0,Very nice. Just starting to get into scotch so I don't have the accurate vocabulary to describe this. Smoky and pear on the nose. Smooth and peaty.

4.25,"After reading the tasting notes, I was convinced this might be my favorite whiskey of all time. Having bought a bottle now, I might not go that far, but man is it great."
4.25,A lovely Talisker charged a little more because of the GoT brand.
4.5,Agree with the positive reviews here. This is one of the best sub $50 scotches I’ve had this year. Creamy balanced and very drinkable.

4.0,"This may be the whisky deal of the year, and along with the Lagavulan 9 is one of the best of the GOT set. It’s got the classic Talisker nose of brine, light peat, etc. and a long satisfying finish.  It has all the qualities I love about the Talisker 10, just condensed and dialed back a bit.  I like the higher ABV (45.8) and the $45 price tag is a steel for Talisker, even a NAS one such as this. Grab this one while you can, as it seems less prolific than the GOT Lagavulan 9."

4.25,"While I'm sure that Binny's is grateful that I paid for this with gold, not iron, I still think the best way to market this, the dram of the Iron Islands, is by requiring that one take it by force. That being said, if authenticity to the character of the great house of Westeros chosen for the bottling is one of my rating criteria, Diageo did a fine job here.

First off, Talisker is the obvious pick from their holdings for the seafaring, island-dwelling folk of House Greyjoy. So, score one. Next up - this is the least smoky, but possibly most maritime, dram I've had from Talisker. Excellent. Thirdly...it's Talisker. There is no bad Talisker, only good Talisker and better Talisker. 

The nose is quintessential Talisker - salty sea air, toffee, that red pepper note I only ever find in their whisky. The palate is creamy, but substantial, with only a little whiff of smoke drifting in the background as brine, salted caramel and cashew ice cream, and red pepper flakes dance around. It's a bit sweeter and less savory than I usually expect from them, but this still feels like Talisker...just a different take on things.

Very good stuff, and at about $45, you're definitely getting a good deal. Well done, Diageo...well done."

4.25,"I didn’t expect much from this Talisker given the lack of age statement and bottom shelf pricing, but it might just be the bargain of the year. Push past the artificial dark coloring and you’ll find a very enjoyable dram that combines sherry, cream and malt flavours into easy-drinking comfort food. The nose is lightly sherried, it’s smooth and slightly sweet in the mouth, and the malty, savoury finish doesn’t stint on length. The balance of sherry and bourbon casks is near perfect. What it does lack is much in the way of peat, but it’s none the worse for that. It’s the kind of whisky I could find myself turning to frequently when I’m the mood for a undemanding dram and I suspect this bottle will go down faster than many a more expensive one. House Greyjoy, I pledge my allegiance to you."

4.0,"Nice smokey nose with plenty of brine.  The palate is a smoke cloud that rolls in over the water and sticks around.  Dry salty smoke lingers into the finish- this is a great whiskey for the price, and it elevates itself above a cynical cash grab.  Drown your sorrows about the trainwreck of the final GoT season with this fantastic whiskey!!!"

Enfin de la fumée...
Ah Talisker, cette distillerie sur l'île de Skye. Je dois dire que c'est probablement exactement ce que je m'attendais pour le whisky de la maison Greyjoy. Quelque chose de rocailleux, de tourbé, de malsain. On aime. C'est un peu comme passer une soirée sur une plage de galets autour d'un feu de camp."

3.5,"Tonight's Whisky of the day comes from the great Talisker Distillery out of the Isle of Skye in Scotland and was part of the GOT releases from Diageo. This was probably the most sought after bottle in the collection with an SRP of $44.99 but selling on the secondary market for north of $300. Fortunately Diageo decided to re-release it and it is now readily available.

It enters pretty softly for a Talisker but the notes are all classic Talisker! Grilled fruits, campfire smoke and sea salt, with a hint of iodine. Finish is long with smoke, brine and more grilled fruits. A bit astringent and the sea salt lingers on the tongue. 

All in all a solid if slightly muted effort from Talisker. I definitely find the Storm and 10 year to be far more robust. Like the finale of GOT this dram leaves you wanting more and a bit underwhelmed. Cheers all!"

Adding a few drops of water really brings out the salt air. Wonderful stuff from the Iron Isla..., erm the Isle of Skye."

3.75,"Ah Talisker you are Talisker. You can pump out bland crap and who cares (unlike HP) cos you usually stick to what makes you - that brutalistic Talisker core...refined, rough, sloppy, 2nd rate. Who cares it's good. 

Now this has little finesse or complexity or really anything different going on and if you want pure Talisker essence look to the 8 year special release (ps @PBMichiganWolverine I have kidneys, wifes and kids I'll sell and trade for a drop of the 15 year Special 2019 release I can't get my hands on...and will pay for postage for the human and whisky cargo).
Anyhow the price I've now seen at $120 is stupid. Don't bother hunting down but if you find a free supply drown your sorrows and yourself in it."

4.0,"Talisker-House Greyjoy

NOSE: Another one of those I could nose for hours. Light Peat, Charred Meat, Ash, Fresh Cream, Honey, Leather, Salt Air, Mint, and an underlying General Sweetness (hinting at gooey Toffee at times, and sweet tangy BBQ Sauce at others). Some Tropical Fruit develops with time in the glass. Great nose.
NEAT: Medium, slightly Creamy mouthfeel. The first sip is all Ash and Lemon Peel. Subsequent sips offer notes of Malt Sweetness, Salt Brine, Leather, Black Pepper, and a hint of Crushed Pineapple. Not overly hot on the finish, but there is a little burn at the back of the tongue. Citrus/Ash/Salt and a nice Peppery Tingle coat and build on the palate. Just a hint of Sourness.
SPLASH: Gives a Floral Note to the nose. On the palate, it now enters with Milk Chocolate. The Peat moves all the way to the back of the tongue. This is Chocolate by the campfire. A real or imagined hint of Graham Cracker and now this is almost like making S'mores. The finish gets a healthy shot of that Milk Chocolate and the sourness noted before becomes Dark Chocolate. The aftertaste lingers for quite some time. 

VERDICT: This is my first Talisker and might I just say, wow. NAS or not, this is just very good. Picked this one up strictly on a whim and now regret that I waited until the last bottle. Had I tried it sooner, this would've been a multiple bottle purchase at $50. Very much looking forward to exploring Talisker's core lineup now."

4.0,"Nose - I get burnt sugar and pepper spice. Maybe poached pear as well.

Taste - Sweet and salty to start, with that distinct maritime Talisker flavor. Finishes warm and spicy, almost like smoked paprika.

Good stuff, reminds me of the 10, but with the volume turned down a touch. Probably my favorite of the GoT single malts.

Enjoyed neat or with ice."
4.25,"The aroma on the nose is a little shy initially, you have to be patient and let it open up, revealing a distinctly sweet soul of plums, peach in syrup, cotton candy and caramel. The peat is marine and vegetable, with just a drizzle of smoke to caress it. Over time, the smokiness widens slightly, while remaining muted.
On the palate things change, and after the lash of Taliskerian black pepper, the peat roars (or whatever the battle verse of the octopuses is) with the personality of a barbecue rib, accompanied by abundant salt and seaweed, grilled fruit skewers and a balsamic note. The body is supported by the sweet aspect on the nose, which frames the other aromas, maintaining the coherence of the two senses. In time, leather and wood also come in the background.
Rather long finish, of chili pepper, salt, wood and a pinch of ash.
It appears faint on the nose and then offers a flicker on the palate, different from the Talisker to which you are used, perhaps more pleasing, but still interesting.
A variation on the theme that, given the price, is to be tasted."

4.0,"One of the few Game of Thrones edition whiskies i was missing was from one of my favorite distilleries, the Talisker Select Reserve. A NAS dram with the promise of nice flavor just because it is a Talisker. This one is all about the Greyjoys, a Game of Thrones family which are mostly remember for their sea life, just as Talisker. 

Bottled at their classic 45.8%abv, tawny.

On the nose: Salty, Maritime, Oregano, lightly Peated, Sea and sand. 

On the palate, This is the lightest, softest talisker ever. Toffee, vanilla, burnt bread. Sooooo drinkable and easy. Not very interesting though.

Aftertaste is the best part by far. Peat spice, pepper so light. Earthy peat. Great burn, pleasant.

Overall this is a talisker for non talisker drinkers. It has been softened for people who are going to buy this whisky just because of the tv series and not because they know or like Talisker. It is actually a great way to enter peaty/smoky whiskies, but it definitively is the worst talisker. Even so, 84 over 100 is the score i have for it."
4.25,"This is amazing stuff! Different from Storm, which is sweeter. This has the salty earthy briny and wood notes all over it. Very savory."
