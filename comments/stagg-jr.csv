4.5,"Notes of caramel, hot, sugary finish."
5.0,"During a recent chocolate and bourbon pairing tasting event at a local whiskey bar a question came up of who was George T. Stagg and his importance in the Buffalo Trace line of brands.
George T. Stagg served in the Civil War and received a field commission, promoting to Captain in 1863. After the war he became a successful whiskey salesman and a partner in 'Gregory & Stagg, Commercial Merchants & Distillers.'
In 1878, George T. Stagg took ownership stake in Old Fire & Copper (O.F.C.) Distillery and partnered with previous owner, Colonel E. H. Taylor Jr. That partnership soured and dissolved within the decade and resulted in Taylor's exit from the company.
George T. Stagg retired in early 1890's and passed in 1893, at a young age of 58. The distillery was renamed 'The George T. Stagg Distillery' in 1904. It was purchased by Sazerac Company in 1992 and officially renamed to Buffalo Trace Distillery in 1999. Whisky Advocate Magazine gave it Distillery of the Year honors in 2000.
Stagg Jr expression was first released in 2013.
Nose has citrus, chocolate, brown sugar, and caramel. On the palate lots of heat with charred oak and leather followed by brown sugar and caramel sweetness. Alcohol burns fades on the finish with black pepper spice and burnt brown sugar, dark chocolate, and raisins at the very end.
This bottle clocks in at 132.3 proof and is still a great consolation bottle for anyone who wants the George T. Stagg and can't get it."

4.75,"My local mom/pop liquor store here in Excelsior Springs, MO scored a case of Stagg Jr August '17. She is a nice (smart) lady. She often prices the top shelf spirits a little under the suggested retail price, so her small town customers will give them a try. I was able to get my first bottle of Stagg Jr. for $46. I have seen stores in nearby Kansas City price it as high as $100. This has to be the most impressive bourbon I have ever tried. (I have never tasted Stagg original or a Pappy.) Smooth enough at 129.5 proof to sip neat, but the flavors are even more pronounced with a few drops of water to open it up. (Drops, not a splash!) The taste and aroma of warm dark brown sugar is full forward, underlain with the sweetness of corn, jazzed with rye spice, and followed by a lingering orange zest. The finish is long and inviting."

Taste: I mean where do I start. Immediately I am hit with snickerdoodle cookies, where the brown sugar and cinnamon come through but that quickly transitions into a darker sweetness like maple syrup, all while having that warm spice to it. For a bourbon with this high of proof, I thought it was so smooth. Eventually add a little bit of water to it and it brings out so many more tastes.

I'm someone who doesn't like heavy spice, and even at the high proof it is I can drink this straight without water. Literally only a couple drops of water if I do add any, this does open up the chocolate sweetness more. This bourbon is in my opinion superior to Blanton SB. If you can find It, BUY IT!"

4.75,"Neat.  Batch 12.  Time to see what the hype is about.  Strong nose.  Cola and leather.  Oak and burnt caramel.  A surprisingly bright vanilla and apple. Brown sugar and cinnamon.  More oak.  This has a more complex nose than any Stagg Jr I can recall.  As you pick it apart you can find almost every note, high notes, low notes, mid notes.  All delicious.

Viscous on the tongue and man that is a Stagg punch to the face.  My mouth is numb. Took a step back for a bit and let myself get acclimated.  It’s a flavor bomb every step of the way.  Burnt caramels, cherry, vanilla and oak all dialed to 11 and linger forever.  Dries the mouth out which leads to legs coming back for another wave as your mouth attempts to fight back.  Got some nuttiness on this last sip.  Dry roasted peanuts.

I understand the hype.  This is everything you want Stagg Jr. to be.  Classic bourbon flavors dialed up and relentlessly punching you in the face.  Reminds me more of a EHT Barrel Proof than prior Stagg Jr. batches (which I also loved.). Sadly this is so good it will just make Stagg Jr. harder to find."
4.75,"Batch 13 review. Thick cherry and vanilla on the nose. Robust, full bodied, oily coating. This thing just fills the senses with a great long finish with a mild burn that’s more of a warming sensation. Although different BT mash bills, I compared this to some of my open bottles which include WLW17, Blantons SFTB, Blantons Gold, HMcKenna10 (not BT), and Weller 12. I would rate it at StaggJr, WLW17, BSFTB, McKenna, Weller 12, BGold. It’s that good to me."

4.5,"2019, likely batch 12 while out and about.  Rich amber color, many slim legs.

The nose is like a vanilla caramel Sunday with elements of oak, tobacco and ethanol.  The first sip is so deceiving - velvety and smooth.  Then like a naturally aspirated flat 6 or v8 it builds, and builds.  The burn whales toward the end as you breathe fumes.

The palate is hands down amazing though.  Rich, complex, etc but for me it was almost like drinking a Mexican fried ice cream.  Vanilla, maple, cream/butter with cinnamon and cherry toward the finish.

This is my end of times bourbon, one for gunslingers and heroes."

5.0,"The now famous, Batch 12.  132.3 proof. 

Nose is powerful and infinitely complex; molasses, maple, brown sugar, black cherry, plum, barrel char, chocolate, cinnamon, leather, pipe tobacco, and dark oak almost mahogany. Yes, all that is really in there and in equal strengths. 

On the palate, just literally look at the components listed above in the aroma because they are all present on the tongue as well. This bourbon encompasses all that is ""dark""; dark fruits, dark sugars, and dark wood. Flavors are rich and blend seamlessly. A splash of water to take it down a few proof points and this one genuinely sings.

Finish literally goes on forever. Longest I have ever had by far. I hate to sound like a broken record, but everything in the nose/palate is also there in the finish before it finally subsides leaving you with some tingly menthol and chili pepper. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Kentucky hug is real even after the addition of water. 

Overall just a transcendent bourbon. And when you figure in the price? If there's anything out there that beats this for $60, I'd love to taste it. Will always attempt to have this on the shelf. If you find it and you have never had it, buy it. Case closed."

Nose: ethanol first due to the proof. After a few minutes, I smelled strong maple and brown sugar. Unique sweetness and complexity. Only nose I’ve had that even compares to this is pappy 15.

Taste: very rich, smooth, viscous. Velvety oak notes with a little bit of chocolate. Based on the flavor and smoothness, I would have never guessed the proof. Very little bite. 

Lingering finish, but it’s not as long as I expected given the proof. The taste and finish were both also sweeter than I expected. 

If you can somehow find this bottle, it’s worth it to me. One of my favorites I’ve ever had the chance to try. I get all BT are hyped up, but this one lives up to it in my opinion."

4.25,"STAGG JR (Spring 2016/132.5 proof)
 
APPEARANCE: Dark Copper. Oily Coating of Glencairn with fat slow moving droplets.
NOSE: Dry & Dusty. Cocoa Powder, Wet Coffee Grounds, Toffee, Hay, Leather, Old Oak. After time some Dried Peach/Apricot. Not as much heat as expected. Very Nice.
NEAT: Buttery, Coating mouthfeel. Varnished Oak on tip of tongue. Then Hay, Unlit Cigar, and Salted Caramel. A Floral Taste? Lots of Astringent Oak mid to back of palate. A Loooong Drying, Warming finish with a deep in the chest Kentucky Hug. Dark Chocolate, Black Pepper, and Drying Bitter Oak coats the palate. That astringency builds with each sip. 
SPLASH: After a couple additions of spring water, the nose becomes all Citrus and Floral. Helps with the astringency, but doesn't eliminate it. The palate gets Honey Butter and more Traditional Oak notes. Adds a little Spearmint to the finish.

VERDICT: There is no Batch Number listed on the bottle, but it was purchased in August of 2016 (As a sign of how times have changed, I had passed on previous opportunities to purchase this because of its $45 price tag). While doing my #SocialDistancing I've been reaching into the back of the cabinet for some forgotten gems. I sampled about 1/4 of the bottle back in late 2016 and found it to be overly astringent. No matter how much water was added, I could not get the offending astringency to go away. I liked it enough to give it a 4 despite that quibble. Time open hasn't removed the astringent note, but it has tamed is some if my memory serves. The nose is outstanding, and while the palate does still suffer from some bitterness, this is still one of the better bottles in my collection. 4.25"

4.0,"The legs in this barrel proof bourbon are super thin and viscous to the point of immobile. It’s also a dark amber color.

The nose is sweet and rich. Brown sugar, snickerdoodle cookie, cinnamon, vanilla, red apple, cherry candy, popcorn all tease the nose.

The palate is spicy and sweet. cinnamon, cardamom, burnt caramel, and the chocolate oranges you find at Christmastime all tickle the tastebuds.

The finish is hot, long, and ashy. Cheers!"
