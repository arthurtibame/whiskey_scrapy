4.0,"Pitted fruit on the nose, especially cherry. Slight oak and leather. A bit of astringency. On the tongue butterscotch and caramel with a bite of spice giving way to a dark chocolate and apricot. A hint of bubblegum. The 100 proof still stands up."
4.0,"Distilled in 1958 the nose is very oaky with cherry syrup, floral rye spice, molasses and leather. The palate is dry and spicy with rye, black pepper, cinnamon, cherry syrup, oak, molasses, cooked brown sugar and a hint of vanilla. The finish is medium with lingering rye while oak, black pepper and molasses fade."
