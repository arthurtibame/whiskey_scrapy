3.5,"Dried fruit and toffee, some wood notes. Easy to drink even at full ABV(58.7). Lovely long finish of wood and caramel."
3.75,"Light. Floral and fruity notes. Oak on the back end. Slight boozy hit, dissipates fairly quickly. Slight vanilla. Addition of a touch of water adds some pepper notes. Very easy drinking, especially at this abv."

3.25,"Add a touch of water and it opens up to tastes and smells. Nose is slight bit of malt or chocolate. Heavy oak taste,slightly sweet but not much else. Oak flavour lingers for a bit. Not bad for new distillery."
