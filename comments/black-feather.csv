1.5,"Great for cooking, not for sipping. Not very dynamic. You get a little bit of oak and vanilla then just a fairly week ethanol finish"
3.25,"Really nice, light bourbon. I give it at least 4 stars on drinkability, and right at 3 on sweetness. Aside from that, it lacks some complexity that I’ve grown accustomed to. That said, it’s drinkability makes this something I don’t mind having any night of the week."

3.25,"Pitched as an everyday sipper, I’d go with more of a once a week sidecar. Some oak and resin with a decent little punch. Warm and slightly dry with burnt toast (or what burnt toast smells like but in taste form, or whatever), some red wine, and a little bit of a late kick. Thanks to whoever left this hanging around after our holiday party. A welcome addition."
