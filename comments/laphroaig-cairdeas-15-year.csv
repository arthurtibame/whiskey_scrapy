2.25,"This 15-year-old Laphroaig was an off-cycle release in the Cairdeas series: not a cask-strength take like the usual annual bottlings, but a limited edition released in 2017 from first-fill ex-bourbon barrels. The nose is more akin to the peaty 10 than the fruity 15 Laphroaig released for its 200th anniversary, only a little softer and sweeter. There’s a Meyer lemon edge to the sweetness, with a hint of heather and lavender. It’s surprisingly thin and delicate on the palate to start — the peat is more of a buzz than an overt presence — but then it quickly turns bitter. After that you’re left with a sour aftertaste. For all the great whisky that Laphroaig produces, it too often seems content to bottle sub-par liquid. This is one of those times."
3.75,"A light vanilla flavor, rich with a caramel toffee like essence. Almost immediately there is subtle climb to a peaty and warm finishing palate. 
After awhile of no longer having Laphroaig, the after taste is an honest and mild sea breeze like flavor that I believe is what makes Laphroaig so special."
4.25,Not as peaty as most Laphroaigs. Nice complexity!

4.0,"Feis Ile 2018 live blogging.  Laphroaig Cairdeas 15 is the second “special” 15-year old release from the distillery in the last few years.  This one differs from the 200th anniversary edition because it uses exclusively Laphroaig floor-malted barley, as opposed to barley sourced from Port Ellen.  That suggests this should be peatier, as Laphroaig peats its own malt to 50-55 ppm compared to the 45 ppm malt they get from Port Ellen (#tourfacts).  

On the nose, this whisky is medicinal, sweet, and herbal, with faint smoke and some inklings of then tart fruit that characterize mature Laphroaigs.  The palate is well-balanced but a little muted:  medicinal, tart fruit, chocolate-covered pretzels (salty!).  A tad hotter than I expected.  That tart or sour fruit flavor continues through a finish long as a May day on Islay (sunset here is 9:45 or so).  Peat smoke and tar.  Good but (perhaps unfairly) fading a bit compared to other drams from this week.  Bonus fact:  a swan named Gary lives in the shallows of the bay in front of Laphroaig."
4.0,"Vanilla smoke aroma with plenty of sweet characteristics.  Initial taste fills mouth with pepper or chili peppers like flavor.  Generally sweet, little smoke taste except aftertaste.  Short finish."

3.75,"Well well well .... time for review 201!   Wanted it to be something special after my break.  The nose had a lot of lavender/florals along with the trademark TCP/iodine loveliness. Peat smoke is there, along with light fruit.  For the palate, rhubarb was prominent, along with overly bitter dark chocolate. To “fix” this, I added a couple drops of water from an eye dropper.  This brought out more of the first fill bourbon cask oaky properties, as well as some caramel/honey and creme brûlée for better balance. The finish is medium but dry. A bit too tart without the drops for me, but I liked the peanuts/cashews aftertaste.  3.75 of 5.  The theme needs to be a classy classic.  “Uptown Girl” by Billy Joel will do."
