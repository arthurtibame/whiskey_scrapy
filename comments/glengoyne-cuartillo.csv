3.0,Quite blend
3.25,"Soft, fruity, nice, slightly smoky"
2.5,"This is a newer, travel retail exclusive, NAS whisky from Glengoyne:  Cuartillo.  It’s young whisky that was fully matured in ex-American Oloroso sherry casks.  It’s light gold with undefined legs and a watery appearance with heavy drops.  It’s bottled at 40% (boo) and cost me $37 from an online, UK retailer.

The nose is mostly fresh apples and toffee with some faint sherry wine notes and light citrus.  The oak is very contained and isn’t easily coerced from the glass.  The palate focuses on orchard fruits, namely apples and pears, and there’s a little peppery oak bleeding through by mid sip.  The mouthfeel is watery and weak with undertones of youthful spirit.  The finish is short and vanilla sweet with some lingering sawdust.  

Overall, it’s pretty bland and lacks any complexity.  It’s obviously another NAS one trick pony, but the cheap price and the fact it’s a liter bottle make up some points in the VFM column.  Still, there’s better whisky out there- even from Glengoyne.  2.5 stars.  Cheers, my friends."
2.75,"Nose - Honeyed apples & pears, orange zest, caramel, golden raisins, baked green apples

Taste - Very thin, sweet lightly bitter pressed apple juice, skin, stems & all, light vanilla frosting sweet, watered down honey, orange pith bitterness

Finish - Lingering light tingle, fruity apple stem bitterness, orange pith bitter

Score - 70/100

Final Thoughts - Great nose on this one but after it hits the palate everything changes. It has pleasant flavors, but it's quite thin & there's this overall fruity bitterness that's very distracting. Instead of complementing the other flavors, it's the dominant flavor and all you get from start to finish on the palate is this fruity bitterness that seems like they tried to mask it by watering it down as much as they could.

Would I drink it if offered? - Maybe

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"
3.0,"delicate flavors of honey and vanilla.
Some wood but less than expected and spices, would say more ginger than cinnamon."

2.25,"Nose: Cereal, orchard fruit, citrus fruit, caramel, a hint of vanilla, some sherry cask aromas and maybe a little honey. There's a tiny hint of ash. It reminds me of the nose on a blended scotch but without the grain whisky element.

Palate: Cereal in the arrival, with supporting flavours of oak and fruit. A sherry/malty note comes forward in the development, which swaps between sweet and slightly bitter/sour. The texture is a bit watery. Again, it's rather like a blend, but now the grain whisky is present as well.

Finish: Short. The bitter/sour note is the only aftertaste.

The nose is pleasant enough - it's delicate and after resting for a while it builds some nice light honey/malt fragrances, but it lacks engagement. There is nothing specifically bad about it, but there's a fine line between elegantly simple and bland, and this sits just to the bland side. The palate actually goes downhill over time, with the bitter/sour note becoming quite prominent.

Overall this whisky seemed to lack energy - it's the very definition of ""beige"" whisky - there's nothing to offend, but why would you bother at all? It reminded me of some of the workhorse whiskies in the Diagio ""Flora & Fauna"" range that are really only meant to be in blends, and frankly it is very like a lightweight blend itself. Maybe it's just the thing as a last-minute duty-free present for someone who usually only drinks blended scotch, but it's poor value for money.

Tasted from a 30ml sample.

The reviews below by @LeeEvolved and @washeewashee are right on the money.
