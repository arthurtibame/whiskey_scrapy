2.25,"It smells fairly light with some wet wood, vanilla, and light butterscotch notes. The nose has a floral element. The palate is super light and grassy with less of a punch than expected at the proof. It's kind of viscous in a good way. The wet wood unfortunately comes through and the bright light flavors of mild citrus, chamomile, and vanilla don't resolve the problem. With added water, there is more wet wood and spice, as well as a mild bit of dried apricot and some vanilla. It tastes unbalanced and underaged. It's not miserable to drink, but it's really not good. There's some amount going on and the high proof is nice, but this is not enjoyable to drink. The spices get harsher with more water and it ends up being quite numbing. There is something a little nutty that eventually comes out, but the bad elements never disappear."

Nose: caramel, oak, chocolate, another fruit
Body: medium
Palate: like drinking a smooth caramel, lightly burnt sugar, haunting smoke, sneaky sherry late and smoky
Finish: long and caramel smoke. Very good. 
Note: like syrupy chocolate excellent."
