3.75,"I really love red wine and port influence on whiskeys so I had to try this after reading the reviews. It is well balanced, and the red wine barrel influence adds a dried fruit sugary oak flavour. It is smooth with a burnt sugar aftertaste really delicious for 39$ and unique I do think it tasted like my pike creek port barrel whiskey before they ruined my life and switched it to rum cask so a new fave for sure wish it was 35$ like pike creek though as there is a lot I like at 40 :)"

3.25,"On the nose is rich dark fruits, dried fruit, bright citrus, spicy oak, caramel, vanilla, fresh corn on the cob, and a hint of roasted hazelnuts.
-
To the palate it is very juicy, fruit punch, fruity red wine, bright citrus, lemon, orange, watermelon candy, then wood spice, oak, pepper, chili, cinnamon hearts, dried fruit, berries, and slightly nutty oak.
-
The finish has a lingering spice and oak with roasted nuts and dried fruit.
—
With a splash of water it becomes even more fruity on the nose, if that was possible - think skittles and starburst candy.  Incredibly juicy on the palate with more oak a wood spice character developing towards the finish.  Once it settles down again, it retains that fruity red wine and sweet corn whisky character.

This one definitely stands out as being different!  Not just in the Canadian Whisky category, but I don’t think I’ve tasted anything else quite like it.  I’ll be looking forward to whatever their next innovative finishing or blending project is!"

4.0,It has sweet notes to me that remind me of a bourbon. Smooth and going down way too fast!
3.75,"I like everything about this new Canadian expression, but it just doesn't hit the flavour notes I am looking for in a whisky. It has big fruit notes. Lots of red grape or wine notes, fairly smooth and balanced sugars. The oak takes a fair amount of time to come out but it is there in the finish. If this had a hit of rye or something to give it a bit more spice, I would really like it."
4.5,"Delicious Canadian whisky with a stellar age statement sold at a competitive, reasonable price point. Expect sweet, spicy and winey notes followed by a lengthy satisfied finish. Enjoy :)"

4.25,"Smooth, some complexity. First tried this in a restaurant where it smelled outstanding. This bottle has little aroma."
4.0,"Upon revisiting this whisky, I've come to enjoy it a lot more. It reminds me of a bourbon (allegedly being 100% corn) with the heat turned most of the way down. There's a red wine character on the palate and a spicy finish from the Hungarian oak, all delivered through a mellow, buttery corn type of thing. It's a bit of an oddball that I definitely recommend you try if you can get your hands on it."
3.25,"Tasted 8/17/18

For being tripled paled I was very surprised by how little influence the different oaks had on the flavor profile. The best part of the pour was the nose and everything after that makes it a slightly above average Canada whisky. I’m not a huge Canadian whisky fan to begin with and this one did not change my mind! Until learning more about this whisky, I didn’t know they aged it in ex wine barrels so that tells you that the wine cask finish was not very overpowering. 

If you like Canadian whisky then you will probably like it."

4.0,"A smooth whisky crafted with triple cask aging, with noticeable notes of honey. Has a strong bourbon relatability in flavour likely from it's American bourbon cask aging for 7 years. It's label states a flavour and mouth feel of a ""smooth, rich & round with a warm spicy finish"" whisky. I believe this is a true and observable description in it's flavour and mouth feel, but moreover on it's branded description it is indeed smooth and round, and it's richness comes from the honey bourbon notes, while the warm spicy finish is a smooth spice. It is finished in an Okanagan french oak red wine barrel, and a Hungarian oak cask later on. For it's price, and branding this is an excellent and bingeable whisky to have."
4.25,"nose with honey, vanilla, cedar.
on palate smooth corn, nuts, more cedar and earthy notes."

3.75,Smells of bread and sweetness. Sweet and rye all over the palate. Finishes a bit like soda?

4.5,Blair is spot on. Far more character than many Canadian whiskies at this price point. (On sale for $33 plus tax. I normally see it around 38-40.) The red wine flavour is nicely balanced by the spicy finish. Highly recommended!

3.0,Not a bad whiskey if you are looking for something not too complex. I agree with others that the oak is very subtle and if I had not read it beforehand I likely would have missed it. It’s a solid Canadian rye whiskey that offers some interesting flavours for someone that is just dipping their toe into nice spirits. I would wholeheartedly disagree with the 90 score it seems to have here... no doubt a hired gun/paid taster that has gone in with some bias... mind you I am biased toward smoker whiskies for the most part.

3.5,"Nez de seigle, caramel et bois épicé dont on reconnaît le locataire précédent, effluves mielleuses et vanillées sans être trop intenses, légers tanins de vin rouge en arrière-plan (j'avais tout de même remarqué une présence fruitée sans savoir qu'un vieillissement en fût de vin rouge avait été fait). En bouche, le caractère épicé se fait rapidement sentir, très axé sur le grain et un goût caramélisé vient rapidement s'ajouter pour amenuisé le punch initial. Léger goût boisé ensuite, très mielleux et les tanins du vin apparaissent à la toute fin même s'ils restent subtils. Belle texture huileuse, produit original"

2.0,"Genuinely confused by the reviews that say ""smooth"" and ""subtle oak"". The oak is overpowering for my palate (and it not a nice vanillin--it's straight wood), and the alcohol is very sharp. There's some wine, but I have hard time getting past the oak. To me, it's a mix of pretty aggressive flavours that I find don't blend well and come off as sort of harsh.  Packaging was great, and I expected to really like it from the description, but not a big fan. Girlfriend also thumbs down: She's drinking the plain Wisers I bought at the same time as an ""end of the evening"" whisky instead. Not a recommended buy."
