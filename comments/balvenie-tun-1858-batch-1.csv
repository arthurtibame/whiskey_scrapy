5.0,"For the final drammers club pour, everyone headed upstairs to the rooftop of the ny palace hotel, where we were given pours outside. Has 6 bourbon cask and 3 sherry cask vintages from 1966-1975 and was bottled in 2012, so it is 37-46 years old. Favorite of the night with notes of chocolate, mocha, citrus, raisins, dried fruit, mango, toffee, nutty, pepper, pineapple, coconut, and barley."
