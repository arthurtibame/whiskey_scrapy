4.5,"The nose is very fragrant, without the slightest presence of alcohol. Strong presence of sweet malt, like McVitie's biscuits, with a vein of aniseed candies, caramelised cane sugar, lemon zest, peach and freshly cut grass. Above all, there is a gust of peaty smoke coming from the sea. Particular and inviting.
And the spices are very present on the palate, driven by the more accentuated smokiness, with the right alcohol content that warms the spirits. Anise and black pepper accompany the peach in syrup spread on the malt biscuit, with a mixture of seaweed and smoked sardines. The evolution and the stratification in the mouth are irrepressible, the aromas intersect and pass the hand continuously, following a well orchestrated score.
Very long finish, of peach, peat, salt, malt, wood... it never ends!
In this whisky, sweet and salt are harmonious and supported by the peat, herbaceous and smoky, with the spices acting as a musical counterpoint, a strange, funny, lively and passionate drink.
And it's only 10 years old..."

4.5,"A bit surprised how little love this one has gotten.  So full disclosure, I burned some food so i had to take nosing notes outside. I'm not sure how much that'll impact things but inside the bit of smoke here killed the nose.

Nose - There's a wonderful sweet characteristic both fruity and vanilla driven.  I would say the sherry notes are giving a red apple peel like quality here that's then sweetened up giving off a pear sweetness.  The over a somewhat salty and meaty base.  The end product is really rich and wonderful.  

Taste - The local barely 10 is truly a showcase of what springbank does.  I can't even begin to discuss the flavors before discussing the mouth feel.  Springbanks always drink a bit more oily and rich than they are.  A 46% springbank can often give a mouth feel you'd get in 50% drams.  That is amplified here with the 57%.  I added just a touch of water to bring down the heat and bring out some of the oils and flavors and the feel on mouth is just outstanding.  

Local barely 10 fills the mouth, coats it, with sweet and savory in a way really only a highland park comes close to doing.  Vanilla, a touch of honey, salt, savory peat, and a touch of that wine finish. I really just can't begin to explain the complexity and nuance on this one.  

170 USD and I bought a second.  Just incredible whisky.  It feels weird scoring this higher than the 21 single cask (correction, it seems I was overly generous and gave that one a 5, I may have to go back to confirm I want to go THAT high) or the 25 year, but the mouth feel for me pushes this one above both, even if it is younger, and perhaps less complex.  Whisky is about enjoying the full experience and the creamy body, oily and viscous, just explosive flavors along with an amazing finish just put this one on another level."

3.75,"This is delicious whisky. I’m marking it under 4 simply because it’s not great value with how expensive it is. I get the concept and, in typical Springbank style, they succeed brilliantly. The only issue is the price. Otherwise, a definite 4."

4.25,"The second of the two Local Barley releases that comprise the night’s refreshment is the 10-year-old, the third in the series after the 16 and the 11. It’s a higher ABV and also comprises some ex-sherry cask spirit, so the difference with the 11 that I tried alongside it is more than just the age statement. It’s creamier on the nose and more complex. The malty notes evoke warm bread, almonds and walnut cake. As with the 11, the palate is faithful to the nose, and it’s very smooth despite the high strength. Still, it plays nicely with water, blooming into flavors of dark chocolate. The finish is rich and treacly. This is a cracker of a whisky and I much preferred it to the 11. Now, who’s going to share some of that vaunted 16-year-old with me?"
