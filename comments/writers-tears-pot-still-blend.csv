4.0,"As the price of Green Spot and Redbreast have risen exorbitantly (my first bottle of Redbreast 12, ten years ago, cost me $45 Cdn. There are now some local stores selling it for $90 or more), Writers Tears has become *the* bang-for-buck buy in the Irish pot still segment (it hovers around $44 Cdn. locally). Flavours of apple, citrus (especially grapefruit), cereals. Maple syrup, toffee, oak, vanilla. Lots of heather honey. Raisins, plums. Grassy meadow. Light in flavour, but what's here is surprisingly nice. A few more ABV percentage points would be nice,  but I do really dig this stuff."

4.0,"Very smooth. Really shows how the Irish can create a superior whiskey. Had this dram at a steakhouse in Sydney. Fruity nose with honey. No burn at all. Noshi pear, clover honey, creme brûlée with toffee finish. No smoke, peat, brine or salt. Paired very well with the excellent steak because it completely let the steak flavours through without competing."

4.0,"Brownish gold color.   Classic malt nose, and a bit of smoke.  You have to try a bit to get a good whiff of floral candle sweetness. A touch of butterscotch, banana and creamy caramel.  This could literally be alcoholic melted caramel. It isn't too complex, but for a pot still it certainly stands out from what you would expect out of something you would get from say, Midleton. There is a nice burn with some lingering soft creaminess on the finish.  If it weren't so hard to obtain I would consider getting a bottle of my own!"

3.0,"Bottle: NAS 40% L6036L2014. Glass: Glenc'n Canadian Whisky glass. Nose: Brown sugar and overripe bananas, some peach also.  Palate:  Carries on with the banana, vanilla, allspice, nutmeg--all sweet and oily-like.  Definitely a little oak bitterness in there, but not overbearing.  Reminds me a lot of Bananas Foster.  Finish:  Decently long, but not complex by any means--a bit rummy.  This make's a delightful dessert whiskey...a treat, but not a ""go-to"". 81/100 MMB 07-06-16"
2.0,"Maybe it was just the sample I tasted, but this was probably the first Irish whisky that I didn't like.  I thought the nose was fine, citrusy-lemony.  But, it really fell apart on the palette for me.  The finish was also much shorter than expected.  I got this through Flaviar...maybe just a bad sample.  EDIT:  I'm trying to put 2 stars...but Distiller forces a ' 5-star'.  Not sure why."
2.0,"Nose: Slowly opens to perfumed violets. Taste: um .... yeasty? Finish: dry and somewhat sour. Overall: Brings tears to the eyes of this writer, for the evening's alcohol ration has been poorly spent. (Flaviar sample, June 7 2016)"

3.0,"Got together with a friend (LKH) for good conversation with a variety of Irish Whiskey’s.  We ran the gamut.  Amongst the collection, to share, she brought her bottle of Writers Tears which she brought back from her Europe trip.  Nosing reveals orchard fruits (apples/pears) and honey.  Very floral.  Somewhat akin to a scotch Speysider.  The whiskey is extremely lightweight, thin and soft.  Butterscotch, barley sugar, cereal notes, tea with honey are the prominent flavors.  Somewhat flavorful and sweet with a profile on par with many Irish Whiskey’s.  This finishes with flavors of oak and ginger.  Overall, this is a gentle, sweet whiskey that's easily enjoyable and a good for having with friends while sharing memories and stories.  [Dry Glass: caramel apples][86/100][Tasted: 11/22/16]"

4.0,"Visual:  Medium amber color much like pale ale. Not particularly leggy on the sides of the glass.

Nose:  No heat. Very aromatic – and much like the color, the nose is not unlike pale ale. Lots of fruit esters like banana, and peach, and a suggestion of honey, much like a honeyed ale that I homebrewed many years ago. 

Palate: Sweet honey at the outset, with copious cereal grain on the mid-palate. Some vanilla and oak soon join, along with a bit of a flavor akin to the smell of wet asphalt. 

Finish:  The medium length finish has a bit of spice (allspice, clove) and oak, likely from the ex-bourbon cask finish. Not too bitter, not too sweet.

Empty glass:  Toffee and pecans.

As Irish whiskies go, thus far in my limited experience with the style, Bushmill’s 21-year is my favorite. While this does not approach the quality of that dram, it is better than some I have had. The smoothness and drinkability is appropriate for its low ABV, and the nose is very pleasing. I’m giving it 4 stars."

You can do worse for ways to ring it in. The nose is exuberantly fruity - ripe apples and pears, some lemon peel, honey, and vanilla. The palate is lush, rich, and smooth, with the classic Irish hallmarks coming through loud and clear. Fruity, spicy, with a bit of grain and vanilla...and a happy St. Paddy's it is indeed."

3.0,Hmm not my night I think. 3 whiskies in and nothing great tried so far including this one. I think my palate has been ruined by all the great drams I've had recently or I'm on an off night. To be fair these aren't highly rated drams so maybe a mixture of both. This is on par with the Penderyns maybe a step up. Solid (just) 3 I'll give it to respect my irish roots.
4.0,"WRITER’S TEARS Copper Pot Blended Irish Whiskey 
  
  This whiskey is a blend of Single Pot Still and Single Malt Whiskies only. There is no grain alcohol used. NAS 40% ABV
 
 Left the bottle open for about 1 hour to breath
  
  COLOR: Deep Golden Brown with many legs running swiftly.
  
  NOSE: Upon opening the bottle there was a rich fruit note; in the glass there is a malt base with a sweet licorice note surrounded by a light fruitiness. 
  
  PALATE: A very light creamy coco note in the arrival with a medium creamy mouthfeel. There is very Light pepper on the tongue. The pepper picks up as I swirl it around  The mouthfeel stays creamy with a light sweetness. There is another note mixed in that I can not identify but I enjoy. 
  
  The second mouthful has a licorice arrival with a bit of a metallic note, but that detracts little from the overall experience. The Coco note fills in with a bit of spice, reminding me of a pepper spiced coco I once had.
  
  FINISH: Light coco going down with light pepper rising from my throat and tongue. A Light Coco sweetness remains on my tongue along with a drying.
  
  I have enjoyed this glass. This is the first time I have experienced Coco notes in a whiskey and it is very enjoyable. It is unexpected yet pleasant to have my tastebuds experience Coco in a whiskey. I also enjoyed the creamy mouthfeel. The stewed fruit note upon opening the bottle led me to expect a fruity nose, but I am very happy with what I experienced.

2.5,"Nose: Floral vanilla, sherry, oak. Buttery rich and earthy. As it rests in the glass a basket of fruity aromas begins to form - apple, pear, apricot, cherry. There's also a faint note of lavender, violets and rose.

Palate: The arrival is light and sweet with a barley sugar quality. In the development it gains a lot of gristy cereal notes but also turns slightly bitter with sour green apple and tannic over-brewed black tea notes. A peppery character appears towards the end along with dark bitter cocoa. The texture is a little on the waxy side, but pleasantly so.

Finish: Medium. Rather spirity and with a bitter metallic hint.

I've always thought the nose on Writers Tears to be much superior to the palate, and this particular tasting did nothing to change my mind. Neat, the nose is full and fragrant and a little reminiscent of the better Jameson expressions. Watered it loses all of its punch.

The palate is fresh and sweet but lacking in depth. The addition of water does little to change it, bringing out some maltiness that doesn't quite balance the bitter notes.

Writers Tears has never seemed to me to be much more than an over-hyped average whisky.  It doesn't justify its price, I wouldn't select it as a sipping tipple and it's too expensive to choose as a mixer.  The sour/bitter/cocoa finish seems out of step and overly prominent and is a big let-down for me.

""Average"" : 2.5 stars"

2.5,"When the great Irish writers of the 19th century like Wilde, Synge and Shaw lacked inspiration they would hit the whiskey with a mournful vengeance. When creative insight was found in the depths of their glass they would shed a joyful tear -  a tear that, due to their binge, was mostly whiskey. Bless the imaginative guff of marketing departments! This was the story I ""learned"" today while on an enjoyable tour of Walsh's distillery who are the makers of Writers' Tears. 

The Walsh distillery opened in 2016 and produces The Irishman range also. With their own means of production they hope to extend their range under both brands, but the first whiskey distilled at their new facility will be released next year.  My tour guide seemed a bit lukewarm about it: aware that it will sell but recognising that it won't be of their usual quality. 

At the tour's end I sampled this vatted blend of single pot still (40%) and single malt (60%) whiskies, all aged more than 8 years, and produced to Walsh's recipe by Midleton distillery. 

Apple, butterscotch and a slight touch of banana on the nose.  The pot still component is very evident with a pleasing peppery arrival. The bourbon cask vanilla is the main feature of a simple palate, and the finish is of sweet, red fruit.  Overall it is a very middling 2.5 stars - not remarkable or complex but not likely to offend either. 

I'm now off to put some thought into imaginative marketing backstories for Fighting Cock and Teacher's Cream. How hard can it be?"

3.0,"Writer's Tears Irish Whiskey is bottled by Walsh Whiskey Distillery. It began with Bernard and Rosemary Walsh forming Hot Irishman Limited in 1999 to create an Irish Coffee brand. Then in 2005 they got into making Irish Cream followed by signing a long-term agreement of distilling and aging whiskey to their specifications.
The Irishman whiskey was released by the company in 2007 and Writer's Tears expression was launched in 2009.
Writer's Tears is a combination of 40% single malt (100% malted barley mash bill from single distillery) and 60% single pot still whiskeys (mix of malted and unmalted barley mash bill from single distillery).
Walsh Whiskey partnered with Illva Saronno, the company behind Disaronno Italian liqueur, to break ground on new distillery construction in 2014 at Royal Oak in Ireland. That partnership and Walsh Whiskey Distillery involvement with Red Oaks distillery dissolved in 2019 due to disagreement on future development plans for the combined business.
Walsh Whiskey retained ownership of their brands and Illva Saronno kept theirs as well as full control of the Royal Oak Distillery and the two companies parted ways.
Writer's Tears is aged in American Oak ex-bourbon barrels. On the nose you get fresh crisp apples, vanilla, honey, and citrus zest. On the palate some simple syrup sweetness that's quickly replaced by bright apple flavors, followed by herbal and grassy bitterness. The finish has some charred oak, wood, floral notes, and black pepper spice.
This is a bright Irish whiskey, with crisp flavors that are nicely layered. The absence of grain whiskey in the blend means the sweetness is subtle and not overpowering. At the current price of $47, it is a bit pricey for what you get but it's enjoyable enough that you won't hate yourself for paying it."
4.25,"Nose:  It's like a facefull of fruit and malt! There's some plum and cherry syrup, loads of buttery malt, and bit of burn.  There's a sweet orange note in there, not like the sour citrus, but more of a candied peel.

Palate:  Surprisingly thick and fresh.  That might be one of the sweetest whiskies I've ever had, it's cherry/plum/apple syrup, orange icing sugar, and vanilla cream all at once.  Vanilla and almond come through.  Soft chewy candies and almond cookies vie for the spotlight here.

Finish:  Medium-long.  Dry in the back but mouthwatering up front.  Sweet, buttery malt is the forerunner and lingers through the end.  There's also a subtle nutty bitterness back there, like walnuts, and more almond as well.

Conclusion:  For a bottle, at this price, I wasn't expecting this much flavor with no real drawbacks!  The sweetness may be a bit much for some, but it's not cloying or overwhelming.  There's a nice mix of fruit and malt that I've come to expect from Irish whiskies, but this turns both of those to 11.  It's not the most complex, but I think this is one I'll give to beginners to help with identifying flavors, since they're easy to pick out in here."

3.5,Slight banana bread nose. Less banana and more poundcake like on the palate. More sweet bread-like notes on a finish that's short lived. A step above Jameson but not unique. Just good.

Update: lowering the rating. Had a st patty day Irish blind taste and this one rated the worst. Granted it was in the mix with redbreast, green spot, tullamore, west cork and Connemara but to finish last definitely warrants knocking this down to 3.5."

4.0,"The nose is oak and vanilla. I would call this a half body whiskey, but that's precisely why I bought it. I'm not incredibly good at discerning taste in Irish as I am in bourbon (strict rules make some flavor profiles easy to notice). It's very sweet immediately, like candy, and it's gone quicky after a swallow. No lasting burn, and the ethanol doesn't linger, finishes with some slight almond notes. This will probably be my go to for daily relaxing, and I'd happily recommend it to a friend."
3.5,"Nose - Green apple, honey, orange.
Taste - Butter, cereal, milk chocolate, and sugar cookies.
Finish - Medium finish. Some spice.

This is a blend of pot still and single malt Irish whiskey. The nose is a bit underwhelming, but the taste brings out delicious milk chocolate and sugary flavors, with a hint of coffee in the finish."

4.0,"27.3.2020 newly opened modern bottle of Writer’s Tears copper pot, NAS blended Irish whiskey.

Glass: Pisararengas Iittala

Color: bright gold
N: ripe banana and other sweet fruit, whiff of nail polish, pleasant flowers,
P: wet driftwood without bark, some bandaid and butterscotch. Very pleasant velvety mouthfeel, not very greasy. 
F: subtle, medium length and fruity aftertaste. 

One of my favorite Irish whiskeys so far: easily palated and very pleasant overall. Only gripe might be the inevitable lack of character this pleasantness means.

Walsh Distillery just presents a fine, smooth classic example of well made, go to Irish Whiskey. This will stop one in their track to persue an everyday Irish whiskey, a fall back. A legit go to that will impress others. It's bang for the buck. It's just good smooth shit."

4.0,"Well I have been wanting to try this for a long time. Finally got a bottle and couldn't be happier. This is same distiller as Irishman Founders Reserve which I enjoy. This has a higher % of pot still which is my goldilocks for Irish(see Redbreast) Poured neat, nose is scotch like with strong malt notes along with lovely sunflower, overripe banana, black tea and some barrel. Deep pulls are rewarding as ethanol is nowhere to be found. Palate is pot still creamy with rich barley malt, clover honey, melted caramel and baking spice seasoned  oak. Fantastic flavor delivery unlike most blends. Finish sets it apart. Most Irish are quick and dry, this sustains the palate with honeyed malt and wood, dark caramel all fading to mild drying tannins. This is rock star whisky at price point. Redbreast is better as Im sure many other pure pot stills are but they cost much more. Im here to say this is the best low 30$ Irish whisky out there and I think its underpriced. Its very scotch like imo and thats a good thing. For the money this is a great value and I highly recommend.....92/100 Irish score"

4.0,"Nose: Apples right at the start but subtle. Some vanilla and hints of honey. No doubt it’s a copper still, copper coming through after a few whiffs. Simple nose.

Palate: Slightly oily but not in a bad way. Sweetness of apples and honey blending beautifully. Some grassiness and malt. Oaky on the way out.

Finish: Medium-long. Oak and honey stronger on the finish. Still fruity and the slightest touch of vanilla. 

Overall Thoughts: I am very fond of this whiskey. It’s not revolutionary by any means but it’s delicious without going overboard. It’s hearty and full while keeping things simple so anyone and everyone can enjoy it. This one is certainly something I’ll keep buying. Highly recommended."

Fruit carries through to the palate and brings along a malty, honeyed sweetness with good body. Hints of smoke and spicy wood on the finish. 

Oddly refreshing for a whiskey. Light and delicate. Delicious."
