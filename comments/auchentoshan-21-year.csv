Vanille et gâteau savoureux en bouche. Étonnement doux.
Superbe!
Peut être un peu cher...

But maybee a little bit expensive..."

3.5,"Now some distilleries potentially are at a disadvantage before I even try them as I don't view them favourably. However you could flip that coin on it's head and say the lower the expectations the higher the chance they'll be met or exceeded. 3.4 is the highest I've given this distillery... does this beat that. Barely...3.5 I think. Whiskey exchange tasting notes are on the money. It has a nice nutty oiliness, citrus, grass, honey but an underlying oakey bitterness resides which is off-putting. It did however diminish as I got through the sample so who knows how a full bottle might pan out but at $200USD over here in NZ i won't be testing that theory out. I have another sample so perhaps another day another dram a different score perhaps."

5.0,This deserves so much more than Distiller's 90 rating. From start the finish this whisky is divine. You're initially greeted with a very complex and sherried nose with hints of apples and caramel. The palate has added notes of vanilla and spice (clearly ex-bourbon) carried by a creamy and sumptuous body. The finish is incredibly smooth and long. Just wow!

3.0,"A light aroma but still expressive. Milk chocolate, dark malt, and something sugary sweet. The palate is soft at first but the mid palate erupts with heat and spice. Sweet dark malt up front with sugary fruits at the core of the mid palate. Even the smoke near the end seems to originate from a sweet source. The finish just echoes what you experience from the mid palate on.

This is a bit too much sweetness for me. This whisky seems less complex than it actually is because of it. Enjoyable, but like most rich sweets I could only have one."

3.0,Very dry. Light.
3.25,"Nose: Lightly resinous wood, cedar, some vanilla, a chocolate note. Malty and grainy and more satisfying than any other Auchentoshan I've nosed. There's a fresh white bread / madeira cake / panettone note along with bergamot and ginger. Pleasant and fresh rather than mature.

Palate: The palate does not hold up to the promise of the nose. It's similarly fresh but the arrival is a simple combination of young cereal flavours, green grass and mild herbs that tastes very young. Had I tasted this blind I would never have guessed that it was 21 years old. There are agreeable malty notes but no complexity and like every Auchentoshan I've tasted the wood influence seems intrusive. It's simultaneously juvenile and confused. The texture is OK, a little oily and silken.

Finish: Short. Ginger cake, pine resin and some grassy notes.

I have to confess that I'm not at all fond of Auchentoshan whisky. There is a particular note in their new-make spirit that reminds me of pine-tree sap and I find it permeates every aspect of all their expressions. When this is combined with cask influence the resinous note is amplified, and the more varied and complex the casking the worse it becomes for me.

I'm sure that this is not a common perception as many folks enjoy this distillery's offerings. It's probably some obscure association I have with a particular ester that triggers my resin-phobia.

However once again I'm confounded by Auchentoshan. The nose is very pleasant, hardly commanding but time has muted the resin note considerably. However on the palate it's just a young and forgettable malt. There is nothing at all actively bad about it, but there is nothing that I could find that was worthy of high praise either.

Tasted from a 30ml sample, thanks to @Soba45 for the tasting sample. It's not a whisky I would ever have bought as an experiment, particularly at what seems an unusually high price.

""Above Average : 3.25 stars."
4.5,"Nose: chocolate and vanilla notes, sweet and full bodied
Vanilla and spices, rich, deep, warm, and reminiscent of the holidays. Less smooth compared to other scotches of the same age, but smooth nonetheless"

4.0,"I opened up a sample I bought , 3cl version of this.  I wish I bought the entire bottle.  I had normally been underwhelmed by this Lowlander, but I stand corrected with its 21 yr old version.  Nose is gentle vanilla. But the taste is where I think it really shines.  I got lemon custard pudding and sweet cream.  I had half of it with just a drop off water, the other half with a small ice.  Don't have it with ice---the lemon custard turns into bitter lemon rinds.  Not sure what a full bottle is, but well worth it if it's a reasonable price."

5.0,"Honey, vanilla and toasted cereal on the nose. Full-bodied and creamy mouthful, yet gentle and balanced in its citrus flavour and hint of berries on the palate. Warm, gently spicied and strikingly long finish compared to most Lowland whiskys I have tried. Delicious."

3.0,"I purchased this bottle from a friend who is trying to thin out his whisky collection.  This “Limited Release A” bottle has been considered one of the best Lowland style whiskies in existence.  It’s bottled at a rather uninspiring 43% and is deep gold in the Glencairn.  It slowly formed skinny legs and left behind some tiny beads of water around the rim after a lengthy swirl and time in the glass.

The nose is typical Auchentoshan:  honey and florals and not much else.  It was very mellow with little to no barrel presence, either.  I did get a hint of oak spice if I inhaled deeply enough, but overall, this was a shallow breather.

The palate was also extremely mellow, oaky, but smooth at first.  Some light berries and vanilla were left lingering behind on the tongue.  Overall, this was a pretty boring sipping experience.  There is also no heat due to the low ABV.

The finish was short, lightly warming as you exhale with a bit of wood tannins and well-worn leather closing things out.

In total, this bottle was a bust.  I must say, however, that I wrote most of my notes while sipping on the last dram from the bottle about a month after opening it.  I don’t recall it being this boring initially- or even as I worked my way down.  I simply drank through it almost as a daily dram and was content to just use it as such.

I can’t imagine it being worth the current $135+ asking price, nor the discounted $100 I paid.  It’s solid, unoffending whisky that can be found elsewhere for much cheaper.  The only thing you could’ve done with this bottle was brag about the age statement if you poured some for uninitiated friends or colleagues.  Search elsewhere for higher quality.  2.75-3 stars."

4.25,"Un nez très caramel avec des notes distinctes de chocolat. On croirait presque du Sortilège.
En bouche, c'est très léger mais très aromatique et finalement assez peu sucré. Une belle rondeur pour un Lowland très agréable.
La finale est douce et légère, miam !"

5.0,Got a shot of this at my favorite Italian eatery. Sweet and smooth. Wow sweet. Little to no bite. It’s Auchentoshan so more compared to Irish triple distilled. Complexity lower but still very nice.

3.5,"Chocolate and spice on the nose, medium body, and an OK finish. Would never have guessed this was a 21. Doesn't seem on par with others in that age range."
3.75,"Nose: vanilla, crisp oak, light mossy smell, ginger, slight apple, caramel, pear 

Palate: cool mouth feel, slight crisp oak, apricot, persimmon, vanilla, cardamom, pear 

Finish: crisp oak, baking spices"
4.0,Toasted Vanilla. Oaky with some holiday spice. Nice Xmas Eve dram.
4.5,2019 Advent Smells of sight honey slight citrus.  Tastes of slight sugar apricot with hint of citrus
4.25,"So nice. Vanilla on the nose. Creamy, malty spicy and ginger. Spicy finish. Great dram doesn’t drink like a 21 year old whiskey, but it’s complex and worth a taste or two."
4.5,"Very spicy on the back, but tanned with a water drop. Sherry and apricot on the nose, with floral notes all over."
