2.75,"Nose - caramel, oak, touch of honey, and i know this will seem like the power of suggestions but lactose. Vanilla and powered sugar too. Very sweet and very candied. 

Taste - This is really unique. It's sweet but not as much as the nose indicated. There's oak but it's not overly oaked. It's got a good body but yet it kinda ends quickly. I can't describe this, it's like a werther's butter scotch candy with bitter oak and alcohol. Adding water and I get some kind of fruity note, but not a sweet fruit and then some unique savory bourbon notes. I don't get savory in bourbon much but this has some really savory notes. The oak effect and the bite of alcohol is very much a bourbon like experience but the upfront flavors could easily have me thinking scotch. 

I'll have to let this open up with some time, perhaps more of the chocolate notes will come out that I suspect are there. For now a unique experience, but run for the hills at 200+. 

2.75 a very good experience but it's leaving me a bit short of a must try if money matters."
