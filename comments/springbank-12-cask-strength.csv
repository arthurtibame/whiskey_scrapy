4.0,"Springbank 12yr Cask Strength (a mere 56.5%), Springbank is the oldest independent distillery in Scotland dating back to 1828. Also, Springbank are the only Distillery to malt 100% of their own barley for the entire range (hence why it’s so bloody hard to keep it on the shelf) in short, they like to keep things traditional. This release is a combination of 70% Sherry Cask and 30% Ex Bourbon cask, it’s pretty damn tasty. For me I get a huge amount rich chocolate on the nose with hints of hazel nuts and a tiny bit of bramble fruit, then on the palate big on the sherry straight off the bat then mellows down releasing notes of dates, sticky maraschino cherries with a lingering black pepper and a hint citrus. On the finish, mellow then the peat pipes up, lingering with a slight salty aniseed background. After adding a drop of water to bring down the abv, the citrus notes become more prominent but you do loose a bit of the viscosity but defiantly worth a try.  
All in all, a fantastic dram not for the faint hearted as its extremely complex, every time I go back to it I pick up I get different flavours (if I wrote them all id be here all night). If you manage to get hold of a bottle or even just a dram let it breath for 10-15 minuets, I’ll be drinking this again!"

4.0,"""Holy Cooooow!!!"" as the late great Harry Carey used to say.  Ok, this is a fun dram, if you don't mind to do some work. This is the 56.3 ABV version. When I poured it neat, I immediately got a ton of raisins on the nose without being near the glencairn. On a deeper nose, there are ginger snaps in there, with candied apples. On the palate, this is a HOT dram, even more so than the A'bundah, and having lower ABV. Without a mere teaspoon of water, I was getting a lemony taste, and on the finish. My ABV sweet spot is 48, so the water really helped me here.  Slight peat with a ton of nice sherry.  More light fruits and spice with a ton a of pepper.  Comparable to a good Talisker. The finish is medium length with a touch of lemon, not off putting because it's met with graham crackers and spice, with a return of more grapes/raisins.  I might enjoy the 10 just slightly more because the absence of citrus.  Both are extremely good and worth your time."

3.0,"Stop number 3 on the SDT is Springbank. One of only 3 distilleries in the Campbeltown region. This 12 year old cask strength is from batch #11 and is matured in 70% sherry casks and 30% bourbon barrels. It comes in at 53.8% ABV and is non chill filtered and natural color of what I would call rusty bronze. 

I had to put on my lab coat and bust out the microscope, beakers, graduated cylinders and centrifuges to analyze this enigma of a single malt. I had tasting sessions over 3 nights and contrary to my normal habits, I had one glass neat and one with water. Here is what I found...

Neat: The nose has a light but earthy peat, but no smoke. There is heat there. It's musty with a bourbony mint. Dried grass or hay. Tobacco maybe?  Slightly briny with leather.  There is also a sweetness to it. Dried sherried fruits, dark chocolate cherry cordials. With time in the glass a sort of caramel corn note appears and a very faint coconut. It took a lot of time to figure out what all these were. 

With water:  More floral with light oak. Fresh sherried fruits. Honey and toffee. Depending on how much water I added (I used different amounts each night) I would get baked pears with cinnamon. Light orange/citrusy notes. 

Neat:  The palate is HOT on the first taste. Once you get past the heat (if you can) there are dark sherried fruits and oak and maybe some new leather. 

With water:  The palate is much lighter with honey, hay and a faint citrusy note. 

The mouthfeel is hot, oily and mouthwatering. The finish is long with faint peat and dark fruits like berries or cherries. 

Like the Glendronach Cask Strength I tried a few months ago, this whisky really does benefit from water. Unfortunately I do not enjoy NEEDING to add water to enjoy a dram. There is complexity here for sure, but it was too much of a chore for me to decipher everything, and I'm sure I missed much on the palate. Too hot for my liking as well. I hope the 10 year old I have will treat me a little better. 3.25"
5.0,"If the 10 is like a peck on the cheek, this one here is a full French kiss.  If you like the 10, you'I'll love this.  More of everything the 10 has, but well balanced despite it.  Nose is hay and lemons.  Taste is oranges and vanilla, with a long citrus finish.  All the while, you get  a light smoke, but not the Islay style.  Really well balanced, even though you get a plethora of flavors.  Thanks to Matt for the generous sample!  Restasted 3/17:  thanks to Paul, I got to sample this again.  Same notes apply...my love affair with Cambeltown continues .  Thanks Paul for the sample !"

4.0,"I originally tried this bottle back in June of 2016.  I wasn't writing as detailed of reviews earlier this year, but I see this bottle has been reviewed quite a few times here recently.  I looked through my notes and realized that I didn't think very highly of this.  Maybe I should give it another try.  Anyway, here was my review posted on a different whisky website (circa 6/2016):

This is a big boy of a single malt.  There's just a hint of peat smoke that makes you take notice before the high proof burn kicks in.  Relatively smooth with a bourbon-esque finish.  Feel the burn.

I'm not sure there's enough flavor there to justify the three-digit price tag, but enough of it will certainly get the job done."

5.0,"Nose is typical Springbank, which is to say briny and grassy with a lemon undertone.  It's neither overwhelming (Uigeadail) nor excessively muted (Bruichladdich Islay Barley), but pleasant, and certainly indicative of  things to come.  The palate is leather, lemon, uncut hay, anchovies, olive brine, honeydew, iodine and just the faintest whiffs of peat and fine cigar smoke, and they come together in such a way as to make this a remarkable drink.  The finish surprises, as I can't figure how something that tastes this earthy, this dirty can end up oh-so-clean, with the salt lingering beyond the smoke and peat to leave your mouth dry and just a bit tingly.  I can't really begin to do this justice with words; the flavors are so intertwined that it's really difficult to pull them apart.  Much like the Ledaig 10, this is better than the sum of its parts. For a CS, this is imminently drinkable straight; very little alcohol burn, and it doesn't hide the flavors at all.  A dash of water brings out rubber and iodine on the nose, and mutes the savory tastes allowing just a tad more sweet to show. The color is a fantastic dark amber, and while all Springbanks have a fairly rich, oily texture, this is the most viscous I've had.  Excellent in all regards."

4.0,"This is too hot to drink neat or even spend much time nosing but dilute it to 50% and you get indulgent aromas of maple syrup, or perhaps more accurately maple syrup ice-cream. There are mouthfuls of chewy caramel-covered raisins to savor in each sip, but also hints of pear and melon. The finish slowly fades to licorice and tea. My sample was said to be from the very first batch and I can’t say how the latest bottlings measure up, but if they’re up to this standard then I would happily put one on my shelf. I tried it alongside a Springbank 13-year Fresh Sherry Single Cask, which had a similar profile, only with nice funky notes of nuts and cheese. Give that one a try too if you come across it."

4.0,"Thanks to Telex for sending me several Springbank samples, which allowed me to do a vertical tasting last night and get a really good sense of the distillery's character.  Springbank has a signature flavor that I first noticed in the 10-year and now, having tried four other expressions, has dominated every single one, particularly on the nose.  Springbanks always have a chalky, dry aroma, which I'd liken to the scent of gravel or -- when combined with brine -- to the scent of river rocks.  Minerality might be the best single term for it, although I have a hard time describing it.  It's medicinal, like the coating of adult vitamins (remember that first time when you switch from kids' chewables to the chalky adult vitamins and have to learn to swallow them whole?).  In addition to that signature, the 12-year edition has some pear and crisp fruit and an underlayer of vanilla frosting.  The first sip's going to be pretty prickly because of the high alcohol content, but it quickly transforms into a complex mixture of that minerality, wood, spice, brine, menthol cigarette, and honey.  Another common characteristic of Springbanks is that they are not sweet whiskies, even compared to Islay scotches, which are smoky as all get-out but also have some rich fruit flavors in the mix.  I do not get much fruit in any Springbank I've tasted, so the palate is a little heavy on the bitter and earthy side of the spectrum for me and suffers from a lack of ideal balance for my tastes.  The finish has similar notes of brine, spice, a bit of barbecue smoke, and then that final dose of minerality.  I see in the description that there is a significant proportion of sherry casks in this expression.  To be honest, I did not get much sherry in this dram, so would not have guessed that was in the mix before learning that fact."

4.0,"Buyer beware! The following is mostly a historical review (Campbeltown, Sept./2017): After a stint on the Isle of Arran we took the Lochranza ferry over to the Kintyre Peninsula landing north at Clonaig. The voyage was relatively short but attention grabbing with heavy wind, rain, and fog. I rode above deck to the constant screeching of the ship’s stability monitor sounding over loudspeaker whenever the vessel heeled beyond its safety zone. In each case, the able Captain simply maneuvered into the wind and powerful swells that were pounding us portside. Nothing like harsh elements and a grim looking horizon to make one long for a hefty glass of whisky, but it would have to wait as we were scheduled for a very windy round of golf at the old and venerable course at Machrihanish, situated south on the Mull of Kintyre. Once arriving, we peered out at what many describe as the “best opening hole in golf.” The majestic landscape featured a long sandy beach nestled against the left side of the challenging fairways. In addition, a gathering of area youth could be seen in the distance and this set the stage for what would leave a lasting impression of a region and its people. Maybe 50 or 60 strong, and all donned in black wetsuits, they wallowed and cackled in the Mull’s frigid waters like a rookery of seals at play. Sharing only a handful of surfboards, this was more of a social gathering of both male and female teenagers. Afterwards, we roomed nearby in Campbeltown at a converted mansion that was built in 1882 by distillery owner William McKersie. This was a time when Campbeltown was host to over 20 distilleries and boasted the highest per capita income in all of Britain. Unfortunately, Prohibition and the Great Depression hit America, tastes changed with the times, and now only 3 distilleries remain: Springbank, Glen Scotia, and Glengyle. This seems dire, however, Glengyle is part of a whisky revival and only reopened in the current century. McKersie’s Italianate mansion was built on a hill overlooking Campbeltown Loch and its once teeming harbor. Reasonably maintained, this aged structure is symbolic of Campbeltown itself, and suggestive of some of New England’s old mill towns that once struggled to reinvent themselves. Having a population of under 5,000 hearty souls, the township felt much larger and robust. Adjoining buildings line the narrow streets and alleyways, and the entire population seemed ever present on its sidewalks and in the lively pubs and restaurants. In the center of all this, and only a few streets over from the water, lies the Springbank distillery. Founded in 1828, Springbank is one of only two Campbeltown distilleries to have operated continuously since that period. In 1973 Springbank added the Longrow peated series, and again in 1997 the first distillation of Hazelburn was produced. Both are names from now defunct distilleries. Still independent and family owned through 5 generations, the company acquired and reopened the Glengyle distillery (Kilkerran Single Malt) in 2000. Our tour of Springbank was like a journey back in time. The dunnage-style warehouses were composed of stone walls and earthen floors. Rainwater is allowed to run down the interior's framework to saturate the dirt below. This gives the air surrounding the casks a mineral mustiness that lends character to the aging spirits. Springbank distillery produces whisky for all 3 labels at this one location and has a capacity 750,000 liters per year. The current run rate is 16% of available output or 120,000 liters. Limited production runs are aimed at a passionate and loyal customer base appreciative of the time-honored whisky making process that includes traditional malting floors and antique aging facilities. A vintage cast iron mash tun and spirit safe both date back over a century and are still in use to help insure consistency. After the tour we ventured over to Cadenhead’s whisky shop nearby to collect our free sample of the Springbank 12yo Cask Strength (outstanding nose, faint smoke, honeyed vanilla, sea salt, viscous, 4 stars). We spent 4 days in Campbeltown and tried a good variety of local spirits covering all three distilleries. Of these, the only one I would rate less than 4 stars was the Longrow 13yo Malbec Cask Finish (unpleasant aftertaste). While there, we also golfed a spectacular new links course called Machrihanish Dunes that opened in 2009, and not to be confused with the original course. The golf and the whisky on this leg of our journey were fantastic, but my fondest memory was that of the people. Upbeat and cheerful, they were an ideal example of folks living in the moment and relishing life. Maybe it was something in the water, but more than likely it was something in the whisky. :)"

3.0,"2017 Memorial Day weekend finds me just taking it easy, sipping slowly to take this in.  Springbank 10 and 15 year I have found to be crafted very well and rather enjoyable.  I would not expect anything different from this version.
 
Dried straw grass and petrichor (finally used this word [thanks Davie W]) are the first greeting and form the basis of the nose.  There is a pleasant sweet side along with that earthy aroma with vanilla, caramel, honey, toasted marshmallow.  More time in the glass and lemon wax and faint notes of peat are detectable.  A dynamic nose that produces expectations for the palate.

Unlike the busy, enjoyable aromas, the body is light, clean and thin; surprisingly so.  The viscosity is noticed immediately and as you are thinking about what is going on, Bam!, tongue burn.  The high ABV anesthetizes the mouth and only allows a spicy black pepper sensation.  Give it time to settle and acclimation, detectable notes of toffee, cinnamon, gingerbread are lightly swimming within the thin body.  Wood tannins start to make an appearance, but right as the finish begins.
 
The finish is sparse and short-lived revealing only wood, black pepper and lemon zest.
 
Ahhh! Water restrains the harshness and refines the whisky.  However, in doing so, the thin body becomes even thinner.  Losing the spice and heat also takes with it some of the character of the whisky.  As harsh as it is without water, I prefer this neat or, if I do it again, with a touch of water.
 
I had expectations of a deeper, richer version of the 10 or 15 year.  Given the nose and additional aging, it was surprisingly the inverse of that on the palate.  The flavors are faint and slightly bland.  The high ABV, I believe, contributes to that lack of flavor details.  I wanted and expected more.  This leads me to be in general agreement that cask strength whiskies are a challenge to master and to find the correct amount of water, if necessary, to maximize the whisky.  For the most part, the distillers, I find, do a good job with find the correct ABV to provide the whisky at it’s best. [Dry Glass: Dried straw grass][86/100][Tasted: 5/28/17]"

As the bottle oxidized and I experimented with some added water it really opened up beautifully. The expert review is pretty spot on. The amazing Springbank flavors . . . brine, lingering barrel spice, and a thick sweet molasses. It’s not the 15, but it’s very nice."
4.5,"We do not comment on the packaging, do we? Springbank has always done things a little differently, but their success has proved them right. On the nose, mineral freshness, peat smoke and rich sherry notes combine with nuts, concrete and odors of an old TV screen. The palate takes you on a journey through the flavor wheel: sweet, sour, bitter, salty and savory, it's all there. A real shapeshifter, both complex and well-balanced, culminating in a long, substantial and semidry finish. At only 12 years of age, this cask strength whisky could hardly be any better!

It starts with a punch in the nose; the cask strength vapors hit hard, clearing out my nasal cavity. After 10 minutes in the glass the fumes subside and I can get my nose into the glass. I smell sweet brine, caramel, fresh fruit and a hint of peat. 

Then comes the a cannon ball on the tongue ... toffee, herbs, hay, and a serious dose of citrus oil.

Finish is medium; not as powerful as the rest of the experience but you won’t forget it’s there. 

Adding water brings out some subtle fruit and cream notes, as well as some warming wood spice.

This is not any easy one - requires patience and trial and error with the water. But the flavors are nuts and the quality/value high."

non chill-filtered
Natural color

Nose: rich and dense fresh fruit notes, like apple and strawberry, along with a hint of citrus. As you nose the dram more, you begin to find vanilla, toffee and light caramel, along with a brine note. And behind it all, there is a slight vegetal earthiness, leather and a mustiness like an old warehouse, which is classic Springbank. Enticing to say the least.

Taste: dense and mult-layered. This greets you with salty-sweet red fruits, then a wave of honey, vanilla, raisin and cocoa take over. As it continues to develop, cinnamon, clove, and lime-saltiness accent the edges. A very singular and unforgettable experience.

Finish: long, spicy and syrupy fruit sweetness, like a red berry jam. The pepper spice hangs around, as well as the salt, which warms you as caramel, a hint of mint and a slight alkaline/copper note rounds it all out at the end.

Value: Right around $100 USD. High value.

Final thoughts: You won't find a 12 year old single malt this good, period. Adding water only serves to bring out new notes with each sip, which only adds to the value of a good cask strength malt. Springbank's insistence on quality over flashy marketing and, instead, following the old ways of whisky crafting (never color added, never chill-filtering, and doing all production on-site) is fully on display here. This is a can't miss bottle for folks looking to take their whisky journey to the second level and seasoned malt lovers alike.

Score: 5/5 (Buy right now!)

3.25,"Perhaps I'm cheating but I've chosen to review a 2015 release, old black box.  I have a newer release at 57+% vs this one at 53.8, but I must say this one simply blows the newer bottlings away.

The first thing you'll note on these older bottles is how dark the whisky is.  There's a good amount of sherry finishing here.  Very slow forming legs, incredible viscous look.

The nose is BBQ sauce, old aged sherry, bright sparky alcohol, light fruits in the alcohol, dark fruits at the finish, sugar cookie sweetness, and perhaps a white bread toast like note.  

The flavor is that sugar cookie base, a touch of medicinal or aspartame sweetness, BBQ, some kind of savor bready something, really old sherry with younger oak notes.  I even get the start of what could have been a port note until it swings back into the sherry realm.  

The finish is more of a pallet overload of abv, spice, sherry, and oak. Here is where you can tell you're drinking high proof only 12 year old scotch vs the more refined and older whisky.  

At about 110 bucks this was a really lucky find and I only wish I could have afforded to buy all their bottles.  No, this isn't a top shelf high end scotch, but these so much wonderful flavor here.  The low proof and the higher sherry content really makes this one shine.  

For me a 3 is an outstanding whisky that if it is in your budget you need to have.  I save the 4's and 5's for truly special bottles.  This is great stuff but it's still a 12 year old scotch. 

FYI the newer bottling would be either a 2.75 or 3.  Likely would do 2.75 and say it's maybe not a must try if you have any reservation."

5.0,"Semi peated and smoky sweet. With notes of cherries and other more bitter sweet berries. Finish is long, sweet, smoky and slightly biting, but definitely not terrible for a cask strength whisky. The 18 year is what got me started with Scotch. This brings back all those memories and is very much a better experience with a bit more refined palate."

4.5,"Reviewing 57.1% ABV batch:

Sending this one out to all #teamCambletown!! 

Springbank 12 Cask Strength is a wonderful complex experience! Let's dive in..

It enters rich and full with chocolate nuts and an array of dried fruits. Raisins and Whoppers lead the mid palette with peat smoke, baking spices, salt and more dried fruits on the lovely finish! For 114.2 proof this dram is so damn smooth. In short I love this dram!

Plenty of room to join #teamCambletown if your not already on this train!! 

Cheers All!!"

4.0,"This review is for a bottle from 7/24/2017 (Batch 15) at 56.5%

This is one of the dirtiest, funkiest Springbanks I’ve ever had.  Of course I love it.  This 12 year old tastes like a 10 year old, and its reported 70% sherry and 30% bourbon maturation, noses and tastes more like 50/50.  I have another 12 year CS open to compare – batch 11 from 2015, which is one of the most sherried and elegant of the 12 CS batches that I’ve tried.  I cannot decide which one I like better.

Honey and mud smothers all types of fruits.  Wet socks dipped in orange sorbet.  Soot gingerbread cookies.  This is a wild dram.

If there is a complaint, this definitely needs water, like all the 12 year old cask strength Springbanks do.  Without water, there are metallic notes and the finish is brutally syrupy yet bitter.  This particular batch is particularly powerfully; it can withstand, and deserves, a nice teaspoon for a 1.5 pour.

Score: * (unforgettable)
How much does a bottle cost: $80-120
How much do I think a bottle is worth: $120"

The first whisky where adding water enhanced my experience (about a teaspoon to 1,5 oz is my sweet spot). I get hints of anise which I really like and only have noticed in Bunnahabhain 12 before."

Palate- Strawberry marmalade, peat smoke, vanilla bean, raspberry jam, almonds

Finish- medium and creamy finish with ginger and light peat lingering throughout

That’s what i’m talking about. I love this dram. Extremely complex, just the right amount of peat, with wonderful flavors I don’t usually get in scotch like raspberry jam and almonds. Lovely althroughout and a huge fan of the abv, not overpowering and gives it an extra umph"

3.25,"57.1% batch 19 and 65% bourbon cask the rest sherry.

I won't lie, I think these 12s have been best with more sherry but lets dive in.

Nose - At first alcohol is a bit hard to unpack. The springbank funk and peat and light salt at there, but alcohol really is a struggle to get through. Once past that, the nose is super sweet, dessert levels. Heavy vanilla and creme brulee. Then i start getting jams and fruits. Rich, full body, but not overly complex by springbank standards at least. 

Taste - I think this takes the classic 12 funk, heat, intensity, and balance and just shifts things towards a really nice vanilla. I actually had a bit of a back and fourth on if this is heavy first fill bourbon cask or if perhaps there were some casks used just to start a whisky in bourbon and then those were used here. I tend to find first fill bourbon over the top but here it's high quality bourbon casking giving these rich vanillas, but where we disagreed was that I think the sherry casks in here are absolutely amazing for 35%. The fruity sherry notes come alive in the finish and carry this whisky to really great heights. As a savor this glass more, I'm starting to pickup that springbank BBQ note I get on these 12's and other more heavily sherried ones. 

I gave a black box 2015 a 3.25 which is a heck of a score and I'm doing the same here. I really love this bottle and at 100 bucks, I could consider buying another one or two."

3.25,"Context: First tasted on whiskeys of Scotland tasting with a group of co-workers, who I’m also trying to recruit to my soon-to-be formed LA whiskey club. Had high expectations for this pour based on Springbank brand name and reviews. Not sure if it was because it was the 9th pour of the night but initial impressions wasn’t “wow”. In fact, several in the group thought it was one of their least favorite (which proves that whiskey reviews are totally subjective and that “different strokes for different folks” rules the day). They really gave me hard time for talking up this whiskey as one of the most highly rated of the bunch. To be fair, majority in the group are relative novices to the whisky world. So I figured I need to spend a little more time with this bottle to make sure I do it justice. This review is from my follow-up tastes. Let’s dive in shall we:

Nose: (after you let the alcohol drift off about 30 minutes in glass). There’s a splash of maritime sea salt. Coming right behind is a hint of smoke with not much of peat (in the Islay sense). There’s a punch of zesty brine...like an orange peel & chlorine dry-humped each other wearing ammonia garments. I also get a tiny, tiny dose of milk chocolate. Well-balanced nose with all aromas playing in concert

Palate: Forceful, heavy hit on the tastebuds. Same Intense flavors from the nose reinforced more boldly. A very putrid sulphuric note dominates the palate. You have to wait patiently for the malt to come through. I don’t pick up much smoke on the palate but there’s some spice bite in there somewhere.

Finish: Medium to long. The spiciness continues with the citrusy brine at the tail end. Ending with warming feeling down the throat.

NWW (Nose w water): creamy caramel & vanilla. Less brine/maritme which comes across more faint & subtle. A bit more sulfuric undertones. Ever heard of sweet sulfur? This might be it!

Overall solid pour...not for the faint of heart. I would even go as far as saying the flavors are an acquired taste. Was one of the least favorite for the group in our tasting night. I bestow upon this here Campbeltown juice a 3.25⭐️ because it’s not one I would readily go back to as a daily sipper . Also the VFM (@ over $100/bottle) came up just a little short for me. 

In conclusion, I would say that I have a strong suspicion that this juice will open up with time and good ol oxidation. So stay tuned for an updated tasting."
3.75,"Appearance: amber with high viscosity 

Nose: intense with light band-aid smoke, clove, pears, black pepper Demerara sugar

Palate: high proof, sharp, rich, sweet smoke, black tea

Sweetens when added water"
3.25,"I know and like the 10y so I was looking forward to further Springbanks where this one looked like the logical continuation. (I still try to find the 13y @LeeEvolved praises so highly)

Nose: smooth and soft, dry summer hay, bitter orange jam, a bid of black tea, plum, sour apple, minor peat (but typical Springbank), after first taste a big chunk of fruity milk chocolate

Palate: still smooth and soft but develops a light chili burn after a short while which is very pleasant, smoked coconut flakes, salted caramel, donut, red berries

The finish is long and delivers the style you know from the 10y. It remains with a slightly peppery burn and sour sensation.

All in all very pleasant when you add some water to bring it below 50 ABV. That doesn’t bring out more flavors but smoothes it out to make it an interesting and enjoyable dram."
4.0,"N: Light peaty wood smoke. Campbelltown funk/sour note. Tea or tobacco at the end. 

P: So many flavors. Citrus. Sweet. Malty back bone. 

F: Long and complex. Sweet and spicy. 

Have only had the SB 10 before this but this is everything I loved about that in terms of overall notes. I got peaches and cream in the 10 but not really on this. Great first impression."
4.5,"Batch 11, 53.8 ABV - 2015
Shoulder pour, 1 week open
leather, cherry, malt, chocolate - nose
salt, brine, oak, plum, orange peel bitterness - taste
astringent, dark chocolate - finish 

Its a hard to find whisky with little comparison drams out there; would  chase this to around $110. Something about this just tastes old to me...like a big-city public library. Its not pretentious, just authentic. The palate of this whiskey goes through multiple phases, and is wonderful to experience. However, each change isn’t dramatic, and feels carefully managed. I’m looking for a back-up bottle."

4.5,"(Batch 18)
The nose is very cuddly and sweet, with the peat more mineral than toasted surrounded by ripe plum, dried apricots, candied orange, raisins in spirit, honey and chocolate. Tea leaves, scent of leather. Despite the important gradation, it is fresh and delicate.
The warmth of the alcohol is released on the palate, but without biting, pushing the peat that reveals its fleshy side while remaining gentle, a puff of smoke on the sweet notes of caramel, cinnamon, ripe pear, candied orange, lemon zest. Mineral note well present, on the background damp wood and still leather.
Rather long finish, of ash, plum, lemon, wood.
An unusual yet recognizable Springbank, with a gentle soul that does not hide a rougher side, presenting itself with a varied and complex drink while remaining affordable."
