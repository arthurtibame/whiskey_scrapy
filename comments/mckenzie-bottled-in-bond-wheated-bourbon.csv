4.25,"smooth and bright, notes of apple and citrus."
4.0,"Delicious. Very easy to drink neat. Notes of honey, along with classic bournon flavors. A light spice at the finish. Are there better bourbons out there? Sure, but at just over $45 for a bottled on bond as good as this, grab one if you can find it."
3.75,"A little nutty, with a little roasted cereal and caramel on the tongue. Finish is good, a little oily with some candy pecans, with an average length. Very solid all around, and truly impressive for a craft distillery."

4.25,Nifty effort for a craft distillery. Stacks up to KY BIBs. $40 is a great price. 4.25.
4.25,A solid wheated Bourbon that is excellent for drinking neat or with a splash of water. Fantastic flavor at a decent price point. One of the best BiBs I've had in a long time. Thank you Shannon!

4.0,"The nose shows it’s youth by featuring cinnamon and a bit of pepper right off the top, along with nutmeg, oak, with cooked sugar, vanilla and caramel in the background. Touches of brown sugar comes out as it breathes. The palate is dry and oaky and leads with pepper, cinnamon and nutmeg as vanilla custard and a slight nuttiness follows. The finish is medium long with cinnamon that keeps the mouth warm and tingling and lingering vanilla, oak and caramel."

4.0,Wheat and tannins with an airy spice.
3.75,"A great BIB whiskey for $42, definitely one worth having on your shelf."
4.25,"Strong cinnamom plus caramel and baking spices on the nose, more of the same on the palate, spicy long finish with caramel and baking spices. Simple but very good."

4.0,"The thing with craft distilleries is you never know what you’ll be opening up.  Will it be something overpriced and way too young, or will it be a diamond in the rough?  I don't mind paying a bit more, if I know what I’ll get is a solid product.  But, what pisses me off is some NAS sourced bottle that’s priced way too high, or some young juice that was simply put out way too early ( and I get it...it’s a business...has to start earning a revenue).  

This one, courtesy from @jonwilkinson7309 , fortunately does not fall into the camp of over-priced bottles too early.  This is a classic bourbon, with tastes of baking spices, cinnamon, and a hefty dose of oak.  At close to 5 yrs of age, it’s a bottled-in-bond, which isn’t common in the craft scene.  And at this price point ($50), it’s a no-brainer buy.  They have a 10 yr coming out this year—-i’ll Be a definite buyer of that. 

Thanks Jon for the pour!"
4.5,"@dubz480's review yesterday of McKenzie's Single Barrel reminded me that I've had the Bottled in Bond Bourbon on my ""to review"" list for a long time.  So why the delay?

It's not because I've been unclear about my overall opinion - it's excellent.  But it's a complex dram and I was not readily finding the words to describe it.  I'm still going to struggle a bit, but here goes -

The nose is very pleasant - a typical bourbon scent of caramel and corn, along with a strong base of oak and mild baking spices.

The palate has some really nice, mild wood notes, some more caramel and corn, and a bit of spice.  It's not an overly sweet bourbon, and it's very nicely balanced between rich, oily, sweet and oakey.

The whiskey finishes without burn and a slight spearmint note.

The details I've given are an accurate version of what I experienced, but incomplete.  I'll update this review if and when I can better place some of the other great scents and flavors. 

Had I been served this whiskey blind, I would not have pegged it for a wheated bourbon - it's simply a lot different than other wheated bourbons I'm familiar with - I feel it has more in common with corn/rye/barley mashbill bourbons.

At some point I'll do some comparison testing to determine with certainty, but the Mckenzie's BIB quite possibly is my favorite under $50 bourbon.   

And it appears that it's popularity is growing quickly. After reading @dubz480's review of the single barrel, I searched for a single barrel bottle for sale online.  No luck. I also noticed that the standard BiB seemed to be out of stock everywhere.  Hopefully that will be rectified soon, or else an emergency trip to upstate New York night be needed."

3.75,"Powerful nose on this one! Pecan wood, juicy red apple, and fresh hay hit you with force. Also some ethanol, but thankfully does not show up later. 

On the palate we get pecan nut, oak, cocoa, caramel, and honeycrisp apple. Flavors are bold and rich. 

Medium to long finish features oak and spicy cinnamon. Not the most complex finish, but appreciate the fullness of it. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, which compliments the bold flavors very well. 

Much to do has been made about this being a wheater, but don't buy it as a substitute for Weller; the flavors couldn't be more different. Buy it because for the price it offers a richer experience than many other wheated bourbons on the market (looking at you Maker's)   An overall solid offering. 

It would also be worth noting that this changed dramatically from the neck pour, which was much more chocolate forward and less complex. Of yet further note would be that the plastic cap/cork doesnt seem to make what I would consider a great seal, with the cap basically sliding out with no resistance on subsequent openings. Whether this played a role in the development of the flavors I can only speculate, but felt it worth mentioning."

4.5,"Every once in a while you trip, fall and just happen to stumble upon a hidden gem that has yet to gain much notoriaty but you know it's just a matter of time. This particular Whiskey represents the aforementioned gem. Now for anyone who may have previously tasted their rye or bourbon, you need to set aside those less than great experiences and give this one a try because it's legit. 
So let's get some intel on what this is and who the heck is distilling it: 
1) It's distilled and aged by Finger Lakes Distillery out of NY state.
2) It's bottled in bond (a rarity for a craft distiller) with median age of  5 yrs and bottled at 50% abv 
3) Its a Wheated Mashbill, 70% Corn, 20% Red Winter Wheat and 10% malted barley. 
Let's dive into the tasting:
On the palatte it's rich and viscous, a solid medium viscosity. Initial notes are caramel, cocoa, Fuji apples and a hint of white pepper. The mid palette adds a dried red fruit note along with oak and pecans. It leads to a long and robust oak, pepper and butterscotch finish. The oak lingers on the tongue. It's a really lovely pour. The fact that you get no young distillate notes is quite an achievement.
Now let's put this into context. For a craft distillery putting out a young wheated bourbon, it's a knock out. It's superior in every way to both Wyoming and Garrison Brother's (the two other fine wheated options outside of KY). Now how does it stack up to the KY big boys?
I recently did a blind tasting with this, my Weller 107 SiB and Rebel 10. The main take away was that there wasn't much separating any of these whiskey's. In the end I did rate this one lower than the other two, but the fact that I had to think about it tells you how good this is. 
So back to my earlier proclamation, this one will eventually  get the hype it deserves. Of that I am sure (even if it is distilled in NY 😜). As it stands today, with all the Weller and Rebel 10 mania we now finally have an option that is available, well priced (yes Garrison Brother's your $80 price point I take issue with) and damn good.
My friends in the Tri State Area, do yourself a favor and at least get a pour (but you should buy a bottle). Everyone else, if you happen to see it, buy it! 
Cheers all!"
