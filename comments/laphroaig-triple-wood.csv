4.0,"Nose: Intense peat, of course, with a berry-infused sweetness that doesn't particularly scream ""sherry.""
Palate: Big sweet peat arrival with a great oily ""Laphroaig"" mouthfeel.  The sherry is an excellent compliment here and seems to augment the peat presence beyond the QC expression.  Delicious sweet berry notes compliment the oily peat.
Final Thoughts: Bad ass.  As complex as Uigeadail, and although this isn't as powerful, it is more well-rounded.  Hugely complex and delicious.  A good expression of Laphroaig."

4.0,"Huge peat, but sweet like cotton candy & fried doughnuts. Sweet red fruit undertones -- strawberry danish. Medium-full bodied with an odd, but not unwelcome vegetal note of celery. Ashes in the finish -- buttered toast (maybe a bit overly toasted). This is what my wife picked up on when she said it tasted almost like mezcal. Very interesting. Not as smooth as the quarter cask, but a welcome addition."

5.0,The nose is a bit less smokey and a little more sweet than their basic 10 year. The taste is more tame as well with some of the similar medicinal notes of iodine but sweeter notes come out with some fruit and what might be caramel from the bourbon casks. I'm always a big fan of the peat and while this one isn't as peaty as some of its cousins from other distilleries the complex nature of the palate and overall mellow feel make this one a new favorite.

If you add some drops of water (it takes quite a few) you get a much more smooth dram. It gets very sweet with vanilla from the bourbon casks and the peat gets tamed significantly. The finish is very pleasant with citrus, peat and interesting wood. In conclusion it is a remarkable Laphroig. In terms of maturation it is in the section of Ardbeg Uigedail and Lagavulin DE. It is much cheaper but still very viable option and I really recommend to give it a sip."

Finish is medium oak with spice.   Could be a little longer.  This dram just needs two small water drops to open.  Also, I will say that I even enjoyed this more after the first two or three drams from the bottle.   I think this one might be blessed by oxidation somehow."

In fact it's actually unfortunate just how much the barrels have stripped this expression of the quintessential Laphroaig character. There's a touch of medicine here, but overall it's predominantly smoke and wood. There may also be hints of caramel, apricots and raisin, but honestly, I'm being generous. This was ok."

4.0,"Cold and brisk outside on this Sunday evening.  Country music playing with a warming fire blazing in the wood stove.  A bit of evening stillness of an impending freezing Nor’easter somewhere, at this moment, creeping towards us from the Midwest.  A perfect time for an Islay whisky.  Fortunately, I have a sample provided by Lee.
  
  I am greeted with that lovely, Laphroaig sweet peatiness with a maritime touch of salt, seaweed and iodine within a damp earthiness.  A sweet side of toffee, vanilla with a hickory-smoked meat.  This nose is one I can inhale all day as this conjures up visions if a wintry New England seaside fishing harbor.  Delivered in a strong wood-influenced body that is very drying; as if I am chewing on a toothpick.  Traceable amounts of sherry and pecans, walnut lurk in the background.  A crescendoing black pepper spice rises and fades rapidly near the end as it work towards the finish.  The palate is left with cigar smoke, sweet BBQ char, ash, oak and spearmint flavors.  A touch of creme brulee creeps up and the very end of the finish.
  
  This is a nice, warming whisky that brings forth a bit of the sea, BBQ, woodiness and earthiness:  classical elemental simpleness of fire, earth, water and air with a fifth element, not aether, but of sugary sweetness.  An Islay peatiness that is not overdone.  [Dry Glass: wet-charred wood with tea and honey][88/100][Tasted: 3/12/17]
  
  

----------------------------------------------------
  Initial sample review:
  
  Whisky on the Hudson 9/18/2014 : Trace amount of peat with some spice and fruits on the nose. Fruits, spices and oak on the palate. Balanced, sweeter finish which is pleasingly long. I enjoyed this a greatly. I need to add to my collection."
4.0,Smokey and woody. Delicious.
3.0,"ORIGINAL REVIEW (1/9/16):

My first sips of this really overwhelmed my palate:  heavy medicinal and leathery tastes were kind of off-putting, but I'm really new to the scene and wasn't prepared for this big, peat bomb.  I've went back and visited it over the last week or so and its starting to grow on me.  Coming from the craft beer scene I really dig lots and lots of flavor in anything alcoholic that I drink.  I hope this one comes around for me and I think, eventually, it will.

UPDATED REVIEW (3/12/17):

So, I'm revisiting this bottle as part of the Scotland Distillery Trade group that I'm part of.  This is the second time I purchased this bottle simply because of my love of Laphroiag.  This triple cask matured whisky comes in at 48% ABV, is non chill filtered and has no color added.
This bottle routinely runs just shy of $70 here in Virginia.

The nose is all Laphroiag smoke, band aid and oak.  Lots and lots of wood on the nose.  It almost overshadows the smokiness.  On the tongue, it's still loaded with peat, campfire ash and smoke there's just a ton of wood cask notes.  The pepper spice really sizzles on the top of the tongue and rides the wave into the slightly harsh finish.  Imagine sliding a piece of fresh cut oak back and forth across your tongue and then setting it on fire.  It's very powerful.  I'm not totally opposed to this flavor, but the sensation is a bit off putting.  The finish is oily and thick like most Laphroaigs.

Overall, this definitely isn't my favorite Laphroiag but I could still drink this when I really want an Islay scotch that's all up in my business.  You really need to be in the mood for this one to work.  3.5 stars.  Cheers, my friends"
2.0,"Another stop in our tasting of Scottish distilleries, this time in Islay, sample courtesy of Lee (thank you!!).   I don't think there's ever been a Laphroaig I didn't like.  Till now.  The peat doesn't seem well integrated here, seems really strong upfront till mid-palette, with a bitter astringent finish.  One maturation too many."

4.0,"Stop number 14 on the SDT is Laphroaig. This Islay distillery was my first love when it comes to scotch, so I am quite partial to it. I will try to remain objective for this review. Clocking in at a nice 48% ABV, this single malt is non chill filtered and is a natural color of yellow gold. Triple Wood refers to the three different casks used for maturation. First in ex bourbon barrels, then quarter casks, and finally in ex Oloroso sherry casks. So basically it's the Quarter Cask with a sherry finish. 

The nose starts out as classic Laphroaig. Big peat smoke, iodine, bandaids, brine, sea spray, sea shore, seaweed, ashes, tar and a mineral note. All the hits you love, plus many more!  Plenty of oak to go around, vanilla, custard and classic English toffee (think Werther's Original). Once the big peatiness subsides, the sherry kicks in. Ripe red berries and grapes, dried apricots and fresh plums. There is also a light nuttiness like cashews or macadamia nuts. While it's not the slap in the face that the 10 year old is, I can't find much fault in the nose of Triple Wood. 

The palate starts out as all Laphroaigs do, with smoky peat. The oak shows itself as a half burnt log in a fire that's just been doused with sea water. It's sweeter than most Laphroaigs with the sherry fruits coming through. A little bit of peppery spice and some definite bourbon notes. There's more in there but I can't get past the peat any further than I already have.   

Medium bodied and a very creamy and oily mouthfeel. The finish is on the short side for a Laphroaig, but is longer than many non Islay drams. It's dry, smoky and a little sweet. 

After hearing some so-so reviews for Triple Wood I was a bit reserved going into it. I figured it couldn't be worse than Select so it wasn't going to be the worst Laphroaig I've had. I don't know why I even hesitated, it's Laphroaig after all. Classic Laphroaig flavors with the added fruitiness of sherry casks. The finish is a bit underwhelming, but the rest is great. I could see myself debating which one to buy, this or the QC. Thanks again to Lee for the sample. Cheers."

4.0,"After having two spectacular drams to start the night, I moved on to one of Laphroaig's regular lineup expressions, and one of the few that I haven't tried before.  Unfortunately, perhaps because of palate exhaustion or merely because I've already figured out my favorites in the distillery's lineup, Triple Wood didn't strike the best chords with me.  The nose is a dry, woody smoke with less medicinal flavor and brine than I expected.  Maple syrup as well, which is an odd flavor to find in a Laphroaig.  The palate also stars that maple syrup flavor, almost more so than the distillery's smoke and peat signature.  This scotch is a little too sweet for my tastes, especially when gearing up for a savory, briny Islay smoke bomb.  The finish begins much like the nose, with dry wood smoke, and then transitions into honey-roasted nut notes.  This variation on Laphroaig would be appreciated by fans of Speyside scotches, and at $70 or so, is fairly priced.  But if I saw a shelf of Laphroaigs, this would not be one of the first ones that I'd pluck off the shelf."

INFO: Single malt scotch from Laphroaig distillery on Islay.  This is a no-age statement whisky that is matured in three different casks (hence, three wood).  First, ex-bourbon.  Second, quarter cask (smaller barrels for quicker maturation).  Third, Oloroso sherry casks.  Bottled at 48% ABV.

NOSE: 88/100.  Captivating and complex.  Clay and ash on top.  Layers of red fruit beneath.  Deeper in, maltiness with “seaspray”, as they say.  I pick up a little bit of talc powder, which is undesirable, but otherwise, the nose is delicious.

PALATE: 83/100.  As with most NAS bottlings, the bottle is unstable once opened, and the flavors change even after a month.  First, getting better, and then worse.  Vanilla smothered by peat, cherries and raisins, clay and ashes.  A bit of engineered complexity from a fresh bottle, but with time, things become more cohesive, and there is a point when it is absolutely delicious.  And now, I’m pulling from the last few pours from the bottle, and it’s becoming stale and flat.  Quite an arc; but, it is what it is, when whiskymaking hacks are replacing age statements.

FINISH: 80/100.  I never enjoyed the finish that much.  It’s caramel-y and sweet, which clashes with the ashtray and medicinal peat.  Some toasted nuts and mustiness adds a little complexity.

OVERALL: Complete transparency: I might not know what the fuck I’m talking about.  At a blind tasting, I thought this was Lagavulin 25 year old.  We were sampling 10 Islay whiskies (!) from a collection of about 40-50.  There was a Lagavulin 25 in that collection.  We were a little inebriated and one person said of this Triple Wood, “Oh my god, what is this?  This is the best shit I’ve ever had.  So sweet, so smoky.”  And, like monkeys, the rest of us agreed and landed on “this must be Lagavulin 25.”  We did not get any Lagavulin 25 that day.  I wouldn’t have wasted it on me on that day.  We ended up concluding that “Slainte” is the phrase Scots use as they dip their balls into the distillate, and that’s why Islay malts are salty.  Such good times.  Of course, I had to get a bottle for $60 after mistaking this for a $1000 bottle.  And of course, it’s not as good, on sober analysis.  Or, maybe, it’s preconceived expectations coloring true appreciation when tasting non-blind?  Hmm…

MARK: 84/100.
VALUE FOR MONEY: Par.  I don’t regret buying the bottle that I have.  I won’t be replacing it, however."

null,"*Score* 94
*Color* Deep amber, brass. Coppery bronze. The corners fade out to gold.
*Nose* You could have someone pour this five feet away, and still be struck by the peat smell. There’s also some heavy sulpher and burnt rubber.
*Palate* Deep and rich and fills your mouth with earth and soil and the smell of wet leaves when it rains.
*Finish* Very long and very strong.
*Notes* 
A truly unique scotch, this transcends the typical experience of merely tasting a dram. If you’ve ever stood on a mountaintop and enjoyed the lush green beautiful endless landscape with fog clouds floating low above the trees and a thin mist tapping you lightly across your face, this is what the scene would taste like.
I may be influenced by the green and white packaging, but all I can think of is deep dank foggy rains on a cold spring afternoon in Central PA. Enjoy this by the fire when it rains.
This punches you in the face a lot harder than the 10. This tastes like you’re eating grass or seaweed, and the smoke lingers on as long as you let it. 
A few drops tones it down a little, but doesn’t exactly change anything. 
This is not an overly complex dram, but they’re not trying to be complex – they just want to smack you in the face with peat. The finish is so long, it lends itself time to evolve and almost shifts gears to tasting like cigarette smoke after 30 seconds and then to a sweet savory smoky barbecue sauce. 
Laprhoaig loves to be divisive, and I’m lucky to say I’m on the love side. I give this a loud 94 and believe it may be Laphroaig’s best expression."

3.75,"While I hesitate to review this too early seeing as I just opened it, but I’ve had a few drams so here's what I can say: 

Compared to the 10 or Quarter Cask, this is more complex: bourbon notes shine on the nose and palate, it’s woodier (oak tanins) has more viscosity and a slight sherry sweetness and menthol/minty/ashy/dark choclate finish (which really comes out with a few drops of water). The 10 and QC, which I adore, are ""peatier"" but this is no slouch, just different and does not have that citrus-like sweet snap of the 10. 

All in all, I 'm enjoying the journey and would recommend once at $60 or under.

3.0,"Rich stewed fruit, sherry and honey sweetness enveloped by a subdued version of the 10 year's medicinal briny peat. At 48% it's got a bit of a bite to it and unfortunately, like the 10 year, it hits mid palate acidic and dry. The sweetness almost prevents this from lingering as it fades to a sweet campfire smoke finish. I appreciate the sherried finish but it feels like a bit of failed merger. Neither the sherry or the peat is distinct enough to overcome the acidity and ABV. Decent but not one I'd purchase again. $90 in Ontario."

4.0,"I’m actually giving this 4.5 stars. I like this one better than the 10, which is one of my go-to whiskies. 

Nose (undiluted): deep earthy peat, campfire smoke, fruitiness (plums and apricots), nuttiness, and sweet vanilla sitting on top. There’s far less iodine (seaweed) and brine than you’d expect from Laphroaig but it’s there in the background. Terrific nose.

Palate (undiluted): very rich arrival, it feels very creamy and rounded with no perceptible alcohol burn, surprisingly soft for 48% ABV, more fruity plums, raisins and figs with vanilla, brine, and peat smoke returning.

Finish: very long, somewhat drying. Cigar ash giving way to vanilla, then a sweet meatiness; think smoked ribs with sweet barbecue sauce.

With water, the iodine rushes forward and imposes itself alongside a menthol note. Much less fruity flavour with water added as well; instead there’s more ashy peat, vanilla and brine. The meatiness is not quite as present with water added. I prefer this one neat, though it is still pleasant with water added. There was little to no alcohol burn, so adding water is unnecessary."

4.5,"Nose: Sweet oily smoke with complex and alluring iodine and guaiacol aromas, all wrapped in a delicate lace of dry sherry. Resinous and tarry, there are supporting carbolic, iodine, camphorwood and brine notes  and an almost creamy warm earth quality with traces of vanilla and soft fruit. Very satisfying and complete for a smoky nose. [The dry glass aroma is full-on smoky bonfire].

Palate: The arrival is well balanced and initially sweet, then turning dry and crisp, with good texture. The flavour is a warming combination of smoke, iodine, licorice, chloroform, creosote, aniseed, mint and menthol. As the development unfolds some vanilla makes its way to the front. There is spiciness but it's mainly dry, dusty and aromatic spices - tumeric, cardamom, fenugreek, coriander, and linseed.

Finish: Long, slightly sweet with a tarry and lingering licorice note.

I've waited a long time and gone through two bottles of this before setting down my thoughts, as I changed my mind about it several times over the months.  The initial impression was very positive but with familiarity I lost the taste only to revise that position later back to my original view.

The nose is similar to how I remember Laphroaig 10 year from about a decade ago when it was receiving better wood treatment, but Triple Wood has more sweetness and a strong licorice note. The antiseptic / iodine presence is more defined than most modern Laphroaigs whilst the peat-reek has been sublimated, which is a very good thing. It gives the nose density and texture and the character of an older malt, rather than that of a young NAS. Adding water softens and broadens the nose but does not change its character - it just makes what is there more accessible by removing any trace of ethanol, but on the other hand it does also lose some presence.

The palate is a pleasant combination of sweet and dry, with a very strong thread of anise and licorice sewing it all together. This works very well, as the flavour morphs seamlessly from sweet licorice allsorts through to dubbel zoute drop and back again throughout the tasting. Many reviews comment on fruity or berry flavours in this whisky, but I noticed little of that. For me this expression is firmly maritime and dry at its core, with the sherry casks contributing fragrance and a sweet spiciness to the underlying bourbon character. Adding water brings out even more sweetness on the palate, modulates the smoky character into a slightly more fragrant form, and softens the profile. It does, however, mute the licorice presence which I consider a loss. On the whole it's very enjoyable either neat or watered.

Whilst Triple Wood is not the most characterful or powerful of the Laphroaig lineup, and some might find the sherry cask finish an intrusion, after considerable tasting I've come to regard this as the best value of the current expressions. It's by no means the ""best"" Laphroaig per se, but if a whisky novice was to ask me for my recommendation of the most approachable Laphroaig I'd suggest this, even over the current 10 year old.

""Excellent"" : 4.5 stars"

3.75,"@cascode had suggested this one to me as a nice Sherry influenced Islay to try. Having just enjoyed the Talisker 10, I'll have this dram as a cap to a long work day (started @5am).
As I receive the pour I notice significantly less smoke than the standard Lap 10. On the pallette this holds true, while the peat is evident it's immidiately jousting with caramel and dark fruits. They play well with each other and lead to seaweed, iodine and smoked BBQ meats. On the long finish the peat returns accompanied with Ash, oak and a rich pastry sweetness. Lovely.
I will say this fits my flavor profile more than the standard edition and pips the Bowmore 15. 
Between this and the Talisker 10 I am torn. This is easier to drink, but I think the Talisker is more engaging. I'll give this one a slightly lower rating but still one I would buy for $60 it goes for in my market. 
Cheers all!"

3.75,"The following tasting was done in a comparison of Ardbeg Uigeadail and Ardbeg Corryvreckan.  The triple wood was tasted and nosed first, and then I when back and forth between the three.  The triple wood was a newly opened bottle, the Uigeadail was ~45% full, the Corryvreckan 67% full, both opened several months earlier.

The nose hints at the sweetness that is to come, but with plenty of peat.  I remember the Uigeadail having a similar profile, but it now is just sweet in comparison.  Oddly, the Corryvreckan seems downright muted, albeit slightly sweet.

The entry is all Sherry sweetness.  Dates, prunes, and raisons dominate.  Of note is how thin the moithfeel is, especially considering the ABV and pedigree.  The smoke and peat slowly build, transitioning gracefully from the Sherry to hickory smoked pulled pork and brisket.  Yum.  The finish has a somewhat jarring shift from the rich and savory Sherry/BBQ elements to burned rubber.  But this IS a Laphroaig, so I would be disappointed if I didn't get punched in the mouth.

But this is the problem.  The overall flavor profile is muted in comparison to the Uigeadail.  It might be the power ABV (48% vs 54.2%), or it might potentially be the difference in age of these NAS bottlings.  As an aside, the alcohol was barely even detectable until well into the finish, which also leads me to believe that there is some relatively old whisky in the blend.  However, the  Corryvreckan was the most subtle of the three, albeit with the most oily and thick moithfeel, and the flavors that are there are complex and come on like a hurricane.

I think the Uigeadail is superior in every way, but perhaps this isn't quite am apt comparison.  A symphony to the Triple's ballad.  The Corryvreckan isn't a correct comparison either, for many of the same reasons, but also due to profile.  The triple wood lies somewhere between the two Ardbegs in terms of sweetness/peat, but lacks the mouth-feel, complexity, and boldness.

In any event, while a fine dram, I doubt this will be a permanent addition the rotation, but I wouldn't think twice about ordering at a bar or pub."

3.5,"Triple cask (bourbon, quarter, and oak) makes it fairy uncharacteristic for an Islay scotch. You get some of the peat and smoke as usual, but add a bit of sherry sweetness. Nose is particularly muted compared to the typical smokiness of a Laphroiag. Can smell the bourbon. 

Good enough to drink again, but doesn’t really meet the expectation for an Islay scotch. It’s different: not bad, but not what you’d expect."

4.0,I'm a big fan of this scotch.  It reminds me of an afternoon barbecue a little bit.  Smoky but not as pronounced as the 10.  Sweet on the initial taste with smoke coming in after and a hint of bbq on the tail.

5.0,"This is pour is amazing. It’s like crossing the Laphroaig 10 with a great bourbon. Tone down the peat, turn up the smoothness. This is a balanced masterpiece"

2.5,"Campfire nose, sweet/medicinal start, hot finish. 

There are some nice elements but ultimately feels flatter and less polished than other options similar to what this is going for: Ardbeg, Lagavulin."

5.0,"Oh yes, this is what whisky is all about. Complexity, peatyness, full flavor, full aroma, eternal aftertaste... and fairly cheap. A beautiful expression from one of my favorite distilleries. It's called triple wood because it is matured in bourbon casks, quarter casks and oloroso sherry casks. 

Bottled at 48%abv, tawny color. 

On the nose is spectacular. THIS IS THE FIRST LAPHROAIG I HAVE HAD THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE ""FRESH CAN OF TENNIS BALLS"" AROMA. Having said that in big Caps Lock, the main notes i got were: Earthy Muddy, dry desert earth (the one that looks like a brownie with cut lines), salt, wet moss (like the one that forms in sea rocks where the waves crash), oranges, toffee, foam, very very complex, very beautiful. Once you empty the glencairn the aroma that is left is ""Ceviche"".

On the palate is sulphuric, full pepper sensation, gun powder, oranges, prunes, smoke, ashes, salty. Incredible. Aftertaste is eternal, ashy and spent fireworks. Complex.

Very balanced and tasty, wonderfully crafted i truly recommend this dram. 100 over 100 is my score for it, go grab it! Slainte!"
