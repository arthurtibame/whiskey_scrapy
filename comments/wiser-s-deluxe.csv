3.0,"I originally had this rated two stars, but I've since bumped it up to three. 2.5 stars is probably a more accurate rating. At its price point, Wiser's Deluxe is a good pick. It's an inoffensive whisky that's light and easy to drink. Best with an ice cube in the glass."

2.0,"As with Canadian Club, this is another whisky that is best suited as a base to a mixer. A light dryness to it."

1.0,"Simple, harsh, sweet caramel and straw. Dry at room temperature this is like plain-flavored cough syrup. But on ice this is tolerable. Don't ruin a good cocktail with this either, spend a few more bucks and dramatically improve your quality. I'd drink it again for free, but not likely under any other circumstances."
1.0,"Well, um, where to start. I would say straw is a very good description for this whiskey. Having been on a farm all my life I think I would rather distill an old straw bale in a rusty pressure cooker than to drink this again. It is sweet, but it is rough around all the edges. Not for me, but have at it to those who like cheap whiskey."

1.0,"I remember having this stuff in my early years thinking it was ok. After a bit of palate refinement, I can say this is the absolute worst ""rye"" I've had next to R&R. It's everything awful."
