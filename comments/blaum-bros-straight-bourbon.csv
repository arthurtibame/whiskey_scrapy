3.5,"You're quietly making your way through the streets, when you see two zombies eating some guy on the next corner. Then you notice a bottle of this laying next to the guy..

The bottle I tasted was 100 proof. Nose was sweet and unoffensive. Tastes like caramel corn, but not much else. Despite the lack of complexity, it's easily drinkable due to lack of heat and silkiness of the liquid.

You have a choice to make. Replenish your survival pack now, or wait until the next bottle find. It's probably worth a couple of bullets, if you think you can get the bottle and get out of the vicinity as quick as possible."
