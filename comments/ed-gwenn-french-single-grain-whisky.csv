3.0,"Nose: The nose was strong and interesting with dandelion, fresh arugula lettuce, and wildflowers. I almost couldn't get past it. I love that flowery note in whiskies, but this was nearly to the point of too flowery. It also had the sweet notes of candy corn in it.

Taste: The palate was not quite as exciting. It was slightly oaky, with notes of basil and various herbs, had a sweet note of butterscotch morsels and sort of reminded me of watered down bourbon.

Thoughts: This French whiskey was pretty good for me not really knowing what it was! I had this in France with some new friends my wife and I made and it was fun to taste a bit of the spirit that was a part of their culture and country. There are better options, but I really enjoyed it thanks to the company and fantastic meal they provided for us too! Sláinte!"
