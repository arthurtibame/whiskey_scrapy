4.0,"It's fruitier than you might expect from a Rye, but it has spice up front and a floral finish.  It reminds me of Japanese Whiskeys with higher wheat in the Nashville.  It does make a fine old fashioned."

3.75,To me a very pleasant rye. Very clean and gentle but the typical rye spice attack appears at the very end of the finish. Good stuff!
