2.25,"Good peach taste, but it’s waaaay too sweet. I mixed it with iced tea on a hot evening, the first sip was syrupy sweet. If you swirled the cup before each sip, it helped, otherwise the liqueur settlers to the bottom and you would get a punch of sweetness in your straw"
3.0,Great with ginger ale!!!
