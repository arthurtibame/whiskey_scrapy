5.0,No doubt one of the best Ryes out there.  Pair with a well aged cheese.

5.0,Believe the hype. This is what rue should taste like. Spiiiicy with a bit of chocolate in there. God I wish I could get myself a bottle.
null,$80 - Michigan.
4.0,"Heard a lot about this bourbon. Very sweet at first, and pleasant.  I'm amazed it tastes that good. But very hot (it made me cp7gh alot frpm the alcohol) and boozy after taste. It took me three or four sips before the cough went away. After that it got better. I add some water which eased the hotness but then really cut into the sweet profile. I tried the eagle rare about one month before this one and it went down easier. I give it 4 stars. I wanted to give it 5 stars bit it's to dam hot."

5.0,Found and enjoyed at The Bird Cafe in Ft Worth! A very special evening with wife celebrating Valentine! Spent good money on 2oz. Of an incredible elixir! Sipped neat and enjoyed every last drop. By far my favorite and one I must find and purchase!

5.0,"Nose - (w/o water) Intensely sweet and fruity, dark sugary sweet, light mint, cherry Dr. Pepper, vanilla brown sugar, salted caramel milk chocolates (w/ water) Sweet toned down a bit, but more sweet mint, more intense vanilla, and more of a creamy chocolate.
  Taste - (w/o water) Sweet mint, lightly herbal, delicious warming sweet cherry vanilla Dr. Pepper/Coke, very light oak bitterness. (w/ water) Cinnamon makes an appearance, more caramel, and dark fruit sweetness.
  Finish - (w/o water) Light bitter sweet like that of walnut skins, very clean tasting, lingering warmth, subtle oaky vanilla sweetness, light bitterness like if you bit into an older mint stem that has started to grow a ""bark"" of sorts. (w/ water) You get more of a cinnamon heat, slightly less bitter that's replaced with a lingering, but muted cherry vanilla.
  91/100"

4.0,"One of Buffalo Trace's distillery showcases, the Thomas H. Handy is perhaps my least favorite of the Antique Collection but it's still a fine bourbon.  It's essentially a barrel-proof Sazerac rye whiskey and it delivers some pronounced chocolate notes on the palate.  Enormous spice notes temper this sweetness, adding complexity... it's dangerously drinkable despite the high proof.  Well worth picking up if you find it for retail, but it's not worth the inflated price that you'll sometimes see it for on the secondary market."

5.0,Holy.  Where to start.  Takes a bit of time in the glass and a small cube makes it unreal.  Ordered this one without a price list...  Haven’t seen this one in Canada yet.  Spicy and gingerbread.  Lovely.

5.0,"Well worth the chase if you can hunt  this bottle down. I belive thats part of what makes the whiskey so satisfying; the effort one must put in to obtain a bottle. It is well worth the demand. Needing about 20 minutes to open up in the glass; creamy chocolate, maltness hits the nose. On the palate, the spicyness of the rye, along with baking spices; cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. With a splash of water, the nose opens up with brown sugar, followed by vanilla. With the heat subsiding by the addition of the water, the taste now brings the sweetness to the forefront, with choclate and brown sugar, with the rye spice on the finish. What a treat!!"

5.0,Wow wow wow!  This is great. It has classic aged high proof and high quality rye. I would love to side by side this with Kentucky Owl Batch 1. I think that would be a close race. The finish is long. The palate is sweet. Amazing!
