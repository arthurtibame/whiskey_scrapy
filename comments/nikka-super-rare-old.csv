3.0,"A little thin bodied. Green apple, grain nose. Medium/light oak, fairly short finish. Some ethanol bite. Not bad, could hold up nicely in a highball."
3.75,Very strong charred oak right away that gives way to the more sweet sherry flavors at the end. Very nice balance of wood and berries that make it an interesting drink.
