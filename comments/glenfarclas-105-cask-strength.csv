2.0,"Nose: Strong sherry with big oak influence. Apples on the background.

Taste: Sherry dominates but it's much smoother than in the nose. Thick stuff, wee spicy with fruits and raisins.

Finish: Add water, let the dram open up for 15 minutes or longer. The finish gets nicely smooth. Spices, oil and fruits.

Balance: Decent whisky, probably great for sherry whisky drinkers. Taste and finish are the best parts – really just not the best whisky for my palate."

3.0,"Aromas of honey, vanilla, almonds, and biscuit. Not overly hot after the first sip, but some sips are hotter than others. The bourbon cask influence is the strongest on the palate. I wouldn't describe this scotch as fruity, as the chart would imply. The heat lingers in the bottom of the throat, with some light tobacco being the prominent lingering flavor. Water slightly intensifies some of the flavors and a little char smoke, but doesn't much dull the heat. Decent scotch but not something I'd need in my home bar."

5.0,"Nose - (w/o water) Bold intense dried dark pitted fruits, dark chocolate, hint of orange zest, buttery, almost like a cognac (w/ water) Lightly less buttery, the orange and chocolate is more pronounced
Taste - (w/o water) Intense prune, dark raisins, fig newtons, heavily spiced/mulled sweet red wine, almost like a mulled port or sherry, ginger spice, dark chocolate, late harvest riesling sweetness, very oily, faint tannic oak (w/ water) Reduces the cinnamon spice burn considerably. All of the flavors are still present, but less ""punch you in the face"" with the spice.
Finish - (w/o water) Lingering cinnamon spice, fig newtons, lingering port/sherry sweetness (w/ water) Less cinnamon spice burn, slightly more of a tannic drying oak versus a syrupy sweet
Score - 92/100
Final Thoughts - This is a fantastic Scotch if you're a fan of sherried whiskies. This one has very nice hints of dark chocolate as well. I recently had the chance to try a bit of the Macallan Rare Cask and when I added a tiny bit of water to the Glenfarclas 105, it is very similar. The Glenfarclas 105 has a bit more sherry influence and has a bit more of a spice kick throughout but otherwise I think it is quite comparable to the Macallan Rare Cask for a fraction of the price."

3.0,"I remember really enjoying this once, in Edinburgh, with my wife and our still in utero daughter, in a lovely little pub. It must have been the overall experience talking, because this is easily the weakest link in the Glenfarclas line that I've tried. The positive: Well, it IS Glenfarclas. The dark sherry fruit, the nuttiness, the wee hint of a distant campfire that you really want to be enjoying a dram beside...they're all here. Unfortunately, they're also joined by WAY too much young spirit; you won't need the campfire to stay warm because there's enough burning already on your palate. Now, if this were priced at or below the price of the entry level 10 year, I could forgive that. But, at $80 a bottle? You've got to be joking. A disappointment from one of my favorite distilleries."

4.0,"Good whisky, but not really the best Glenfarclas has to offer; however, if you consider both the price point and the ABV, this is a probably a steal. The nose was underwhelming, with sweet sherry notes being predominant. The palate is much stronger and suprisingly different. Whereas the nose was nuttier and floral, to the tongue this whisky is fruity, with sultana raisins really peering through. The finish is fairly long and pleasant, reminding you how robust the entire product is at 60%. All in all enjoyable."

3.0,"I have heard many people talk this up, and I like Glenfarclas, so why not?

The nose is a bit foreboding because of the immediate heat. Underneath this prickly heat is hazelnut cream, dark honey, brown sugar, and some dried fruit. The palate is also quit hot and tends to sizzle the dry currants and chocolate you find there. I found myself adding just one more drop water...ok, maybe one more...ok, last one...

With a healthy dose of water  the texture gets creamier and the primary flavors don't seem to be on fire anymore. The wood tannins reveal themselves as well. The finish is full of mouth watering spice and it goes on quite a bit. This would be a good bridge for uncut bourbon drinkers into Scotch."

3.0,"Cascode summed up this one relatively well. Younger, thinner sherried profile. Water seemed to wash it out rather than enhance the flavor for me. I didn't expend the time and effort that cascode did to try and tease out underlying elements by leaving it awhile but I suspect wouldn't have made much of a difference to my assessment. Didn't even bother to finish the dram in the end not because it was bad I just lost interest half way through. Solid 3"
3.0,"Nose: Immediately after pouring there is a generic sherry/whisky nose that is both aggressive and surprisingly thin. Put a cover over the glass and amuse yourself for 15 minutes then come back and there will be a big improvement. Rich pungent sherry and nuts - Brazil nuts and hazelnuts.  Quite a lot of vanilla. A touch of toffee and treacle with baked raisins in the background and oak. Heavy, dark, sherried fruitcake.  Interestingly, powerful ethanol aromas are entirely absent. As water is added the nose gradually wakes up. 

Palate: Tasted neat it has a very powerful and drying alcohol arrival that swamps out the development with its intensity. By the time the taste buds revive you're into the finish and left with just dried grape and oak flavours. Add water for heaven's sake.  Diluted down to under 50% abv things are a lot more sensible. Still powerful but creamy, rich and spicy - very spicy - almost peppery - some citrus notes emerge that were obscured previously, along with some sour black cherries and bitter cacao balanced by a dark sherry sweetness.  Even diluted it is still powerful.

Finish: Medium/long - sherry, coffee, dark chocolate, malt, and a distracting faint dull metallic taste that is balanced by sweet grapey notes which are the final echo.

Previous batches I've had of this have been better. For all its heft there is an arrogant youth at the core of this particular performance, and a consequent lack of maturity throughout. There are some fine notes in the song this whisky sings, but for me they were drowned out by off notes in the chorus.

Don't even consider drinking this neat - dilution is essential. It has some fine qualities, but you have to dig for them and they are more easily accessible in the distillery's other expressions. If I had the choice of drinking either this particular bottling 105 or any of the current age statement expressions, the age statement would be my choice without a moment's hesitation. However by next year things might have changed - that happens with Glenfarclas.

4.0,"105th tasting note, Glenfarclas 105. Just as planned. Got this as a little extra with my last Master of Malt Sample order. Heard many good things about it, and for a reason. Value for money is incredible with this juice. 

The nose starts with sweet baking spices, faint plums, some honey and the smell of rum dipped raisins coated in chocolate. You know those cheap snacks you can get. Promising start. 

The taste is interesting. For a 120 proof whisky, it is surprisingly gentle. There is some warmth, but it never burns. It has almost a creamy mouthfeel to it. There is a bit of chocolate, some buttered popcorn, a pinch of saltiness and a slight note of barrel char that is integrated in the entire taste profile. The salt was the surprising part. 

It is a very good taste, I just wish it was a bit more...not sure if complex is the right word. I had a bit of a hard time picking out the notes, but the overall result was pleasing. That's also what kept it at 4 stars instead of 5. 

The aftertaste is a bit herbal with chocolate notes. Doesn't stay all that long, but also not as short as some others. 

Also, the price is great on these. 32 bucks for a liter bottle. Can't argue with that. 

All in all, very good stuff. And I think this might replace something like the lower end Balvenies and Monkey Shoulder in my collection once those bottles are empty."
4.0,"I was recently traveling for work and decided to browse the wares at a liquor store unfamiliar to me and decided to purchase a bottle. I will say as not a mega-fan of sherry/overly sweet whisky but I do enjoy a reasonably priced Glenfarclas. I was curious to see what this cask strength sweet whisky would have to offer. 
                
                The nose is dark chocolate and sherry, nothing too complex here.
    
                The palate is a different experience all together. The best way I can describe it is imagine yourself in the ring with a boxer who is known for their left jab. The bell rings and you take the jab but you were not expecting the right hook following it. This whisky is the right hook of the Glenfarclas line. I don’t know if I just did not prepare myself for the cask strength experience here knowing how friendly Glenfarclas usually is or it really does pack that big of a punch (I would guess the former). Knowing the right hook was coming on the second sip I experienced sherry, chocolate, dried raisons and almonds with a spicy burn from the high abv. 
                
                While this whisky truly was an experience I am not sure a cask strength Speyside is what I would spend my money on for a whisky I want to put up a fight. I think I would rather sip Aberlour’s A’Bunadh as it is a bit cheaper and in my opinion, preferable. Am I glad I picked it up? Yes. Do I now know to duck after the left jab? Yup.

4.0,"Nose: Rich, deep sherry and walnuts, dark malty chocolate, butterscotch, caramel, espresso, vanilla, toffee apples and toasted muesli. Dark sherried fruit cake with glace cherries. Adding water develops more intense richness and brings out some orange zest, and over a longer time it rounds and smooths the presentation.

Palate: The arrival is powerful and spicy - faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound ... sorry. Ahem. The sherried entry is commanding, drying and swamps the palate. As the barrage subsides, juicy grape, dried raisins, and peppery oak tannins emerge along with mixed nuts, rough-cut Dundee marmalade, milk chocolate and hard toffee. Adding water makes the palate velvety and much more approachable and loses nothing in the process, with a creamy, citrus and black cherry character developing, underlined by bittersweet cacao.

Finish: Medium/long. Sherry, cacao and malt, hazelnuts and some hot spice.

Yahoo! 105 is back in form. I last tasted this about a year ago and was disappointed at the time in what seemed to me a very lacklustre and dull batch.  Glenfarclas is a distillery that often has wide variation between batches - their 15 year was similarly not so great 1-2 years ago - maybe there were some bad casks a while back?

Anyway this most recent release of 105 is very good. An altogether fresher, more crisp and alive expression.  Certainly accessible and interesting neat, but it needs dilution to be really enjoyable. There is a great deal of complexity locked away behind the massive wall of its neat profile.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars."

4.25,"It’s fruity, almost winey, right from the off. At 60% - SIXTY PERCENT! - it’s boozy too, on the nose. It really needs several drops of water; it’s just too much otherwise. Even then it’s a massive burst of dark red fruit, alcohol and chocolate, with a gentle thrum of malt underlying. The rich wine flavour clings to your tongue for ages afterwards. This is perhaps the fruitiest, most bumptious Scotch I’ve ever had. Don’t underestimate it. Do buy it."

4.0,"This review was posted on Barreled 2/22/18, based on a sample from Flaviar. 

This Speyside dram has no age statement and is bottled at an impressive 60% ABV. It’s a nice medium gold in the glass and leaves a thick oily coating that leaves long slow legs. 

The nose was surprisingly tame for such a powerful dram. There was very little alcohol burn. There was lots of sherry with a fruity, floral oak. Adding water brought out a darker, malty character. Some hints of chocolate and spice as well. 

The palate was HOT! (Duh!) This whisky definitely benefits from the addition of water. Behind the heat is a honeyed sweetness and cinnamon. Water reveals caramel and dark chocolate. It has a thick mouthfeel that lingers long after it is swallowed. 

The finish is long, warm, peppery oak with just a hint of smoke. This is a really nice whisky that I wouldn’t mind getting to know a little better but the $92 price tag online seems a little steep for an NAS whisky, cask strength or not. Overall I give it 4/5."

3.75,"Great dram for money ratio, not a complex whisky, but it has a really great cumulative sherry pallet. The taste is long lasting, building up more intense sherry taste when you sip along. Its cask strength and sherry taste reminds me of the Aberlour A'Bunadh, aldo its less intense and lags the heavy chocolate tastes. 

I found a few drops of water really brings out the full potential of the whisky. Really boosting the sherry tones and making it more spicy. 

Hint: pore a slightly bigger dram :)"

Taste : Quite soft for the ABV, but the alcohol taste is present. Adding quite a bit of water makes the taste more whole, giving more place to the fruity side.

3.75,"Glenfarclas tasting night at The Oak Barrel, Sydney, 4 July 2019. Whisky #5

Nose: Strongly fragrant with sherry, toffee and malt, this is a nose of considerable depth. There are notes of honey, leather, orange marmalade, marzipan, licorice, caramel, coffee, dark fruit cake, glace cherries and vanilla. Water develops some hot spicy aromas and broadens the nose. For a high-strength whisky there is surprisingly little alcohol apparent.

Palate: Potent, sweet, highly sherried but also peppery and dry, the arrival swamps the palate and takes a moment to subside. Once it does some very malty brown sugar and spice notes come through on the development, but oddly it's less spicy than the young Glenfarclas age statement expressions. Lots of nutty flavours (almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts) and heaps of dark boiled Christmas pudding. Rum and brandy overtones with dates and candied figs. The texture is supple but assertive and a dash of water softens it nicely.

Finish: Medium/long. Dark chocolate, fruit and malt. Ends sweet but with a little tannin spice.

The original high-strength single malt NAS, and still just about unique. There are plenty of cask-strength expressions around, and plenty of NAS nowadays, but I can’t think of any other core-range NAS produced at 60 abv or higher.

105 is a very bold, hugely flavourful whisky but it’s not what I’d call a sherry-bomb. Those hefty Glenfarclas baked and boiled fruit tones from the direct fired stills are more than a match for any mere fortified wine. This expression has presence, reserve and dignity, but in comparison to the 25 year old (and arguably any of the age statement expressions) you could fairly say it has a touch less class and seems a little 2-dimensional.

It can be taken neat, in fact many people will only drink it this way, but for my tastes it needs water. Not just to tone down the alcohol, but to bring out the subtle nuances that are definitely there but so easy to miss otherwise.

“Good” 3.75 stars"

4.25,"Oh, Glenfarclas.  I’ve kind of always looked down my nose at you.  You offer up name brand, department store quality at Walmart prices.  You are the dollar menu whisky.  I’ve tried multiple ages of official distillery bottled Glenfarclas:  the 12 year old all the way to the 25.  I believe I’ve had unspecified, independent bottles of even older stock.  My previous reviews have been borderline unfair, as I bash away because I haven’t experienced anything earth shaking.  It’s almost always just solid, sherry cask single malts.  I’m sorry for that unjust oversight.

This bottle of Glenfarclas 105, no it’s not 105 year old whisky, is the cask strength offering that’s bottled at 60% ABV.  It’s light copper and gold in the tasting glass and produces very thin and sparse legs when you give it a whirl.  A nice, slick oily appearance and tiny beads around the rim indicate it’s of very high proof.  The fact you can get a 1L bottle of this for around $30 is astounding.

The nose is immediately as harsh as you’d expect.  Heat from the ABV and cinnamon lead the charge, but if you let it rest, and maybe add an ice cube or a few drops of water, you are rewarded with tea leaves and toffee.  Flambé fruits seem to sizzle your nostrils just as you move in for a sip.  The palate reveals semi-complex sherry notes:  grapes, orchard fruit and barley.  The oak adds some astringency while the super hot mouthfeel turns slightly oily and leaves some over-ripened berries heading into the finish.  It’s a long and abrasively hot finish, too.  Lingering oak and a satisfying grape and vanilla note help cool the burn provided you don’t find yourself chasing them away with some water.

Overall, this is my favorite Glenfarclas to date.  I think the cask strength keeps you on your toes long enough that you end up really appreciating the sherry flavors that eventually come home to roost.  Factor in price and this is a big time win.  I’ve worked on this bottle for a month or so now and I’ve even slid it over into my blending experiments simply because the high proof and pleasant sherry helps make a wonderful foundation to any blended whisky you can dream up and the ABV helps keep your total alcohol percentages above board.  I will be replacing this bottle every time it goes dry.  4-4.25 stars for ticking all the right boxes.  Cheers, my friends."

With some water: cinammon, nutmeg became dominant, fruity notes are in the background. Pears. Still very nice. Palate: neat - it is aggresive. Spicey notes first, then strong alcohol destroyed everything for me. With some water it gets creamy, honey, some bitter oak spices just before swallowing it. Pleasant caramel finish. For me the best Glenfarclas, due to the relatively weaker oaky spices."

2.75,"Heavy. This one is strong. 

Bottled at 60% abv! That is right, with an Old Oak dark color.

On the nose the alcohol mark doesn't feel as a 60% abv, but it does make your nose tingle a little bit. The aroma has plum, new recently cut wood, almonds, lime and earth (like dirt) notes.

On the palate is A SPICE NUCLEAR BOMB. Black Pepper, Red hot chilli peppers, wasabi and hints of oak. The body is medium and the aftertaste is also very spicy, with a little hotness. Is not unpleasant but definitively harsh because of the thrusting spicyness. 

Overall i can catalogue this one as an experience that you should have at least once. Very powerful. 59 out of 100."

4.0,"Glenfarclas is unique in many ways. It is one of few major major distilleries in Scotland that is still family owned and operated. John Grant purchased the distillery in 1865 and it has remained in the Grant family's hands ever since. The stills are heated with direct fire, which is extremely rare nowadays. While Glenfarclas is located in the middle of what is considered the Speyside region, their labels proclaim that it is a Highland Single Malt.
The distillery uses European Oak ex-oloroso sherry casks exclusively in maturation, which results in some of the most ""sherried"" whiskies available.
105° expression was first introduced in 1968, the first single malt to be bottled at cask strength. The 105° is actually the British equivalent of 120 proof. Supposedly, the distillery achieves 60% ABV through careful selection of barrels and without adding any water.
On the nose there's lots of dried fruit, golden raisins, orange peel, berries. On the palate gummy bears candy, raspberry jam, orange marmalade, wood char. On the finish, more berry jam, grassy note and leather. This may be just me being used to higher proof with a lot of the cask strength stuff I've been drinking, but it does not seem all that hot at 60% ABV.
This is one of the finest examples of sherry finished single malts."

The archetypal modern NAS cask strength sherry bomb is Glenfarclas 105.  That is to say, one spicy, woody, and nutty fucker that tastes nothing like sherry.  Every distillery known for sherried whiskies is releasing a young cask strength expression and pricing it in the same range; I suspect it’s because they can make big margins off really young whisky matured in cheap made-to-order sherry casks.  I can’t keep up with or tell the difference between all the examples; they all Hacksaw Jim Duggan your throat with a mass produced stave.  Hoooo!

You better add water to dilute this, in order to get a sherried whisky experience instead of a WWE one; perhaps a teaspoon per ounce.  Then you get some sultanas, toffee, and nutmeg, and a nice oaky vanilla finish; rather than the blast of pepper, alcohol, and bitter oak if you try this neat.  I got this bottle for sale at $58.99.  At that rare price, I would buy this again.  But usually these bottles approach $100.  At that price, if I wanted a sherried Glenfarclas, I would spend a few extra bucks for a Glenfarclas 17; or, if I wanted a young sherry bomb, I would reach for an older bottling of Aberlour A’bunadh that I have stashed away.

Slightly aggressive, the nose starts off with fruity sweetness, strawberry yogurt, candy apple and alcohol. With water, the fruitiness intensifies, featuring peach, roasted nuts and hints of vinegar. After a bold and peppery arrival, this young beast becomes quite tasty. Chocolate, juicy berries and a touch of mint flow into a lingering finish, full of spices, bitter oranges and tiramisu. Calling this malt 'the poor man's A'bunadh' wouldn't do it justice!
