4.5,"Smokiness and charred wood on the. Owe. Natural and fresh smelling, like freshly cut grass. 

An earthy and smooth taste with smoky overtones and a citrus zest. Long linger with the smokiness retreating while the citrus comes out."
3.0,First Irish whisky. Harshness that doesn't get balanced out by the peat. Unique flavours of banana and icing sugar but overall it didn't really work for me
