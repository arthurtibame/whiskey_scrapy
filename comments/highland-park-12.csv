1.5,"This is life-less sherry water. Strong pass. 

I really have no idea how this has a 91 distiller score. I can only assume that there has been a sharp drop-off in quality since 2013, when that review was published. 

When I first opened this, there were a couple of interesting drams but, as I continued through the bottle, it became one-note and incredibly boring. The fact that HP waters this down to 43% doesn’t do it any favors; it leaves nothing to play with. I tried giving it air and water and it did very little. Like a cat batting around a dead mouse, I kept hoping it would wake up but alas it did not. I ended up dumping the rest of it into an infinity bottle."

2.75,"With the new ‘Viking Honour’ version of the 12 yo out, I had wanted to try them side by side to make sure the contents didn’t change as most spirits are known to. However, a craving for a couple drams has now overcome those most noble of intentions and open the bottle I bought 3 years ago. 

Granted, this isn’t coming from a glencairn but there is next to nothing on the nose. A bit of oloroso sweetness, peatiness along the lines of Springbank 15 and maybe a touch of honey and just a hint of sea spray. 

Excellent viscosity, about the only exciting part of this malt. Palate brings nice warmth and a bit of sherry sweetness from very young, seasoned casks. Smoke comes through quite nicely. Underlying bitter notes from both the peat and less than stellar casking.

Finish begins promisingly, but just falls off a cliff. Smoke and honey is about it before disappears. 

Overall, I’m happy I bought it when I did, especially for the price I got it at. But it won’t be replaced when empty"

4.0,"Deep into my second bottle I've had for myself so I felt it was time to give it a write.

Nose:
Honey, apricot and black plum, sweet cereal, wine-flavored pipe tobacco (really, I promise, even if it is just the faintest finishing note)

Palate:
Much more straightforward than you may imagine but not at all in a bad way. Sweet caramel apples, a smoky funk I'd call mainly meaty with hints of engine oil hints you midway into a burst of sweet, chewy, malty, richness of cream/cereal finish.  I normally try to stay succinct in this section but it really is astoundingly fun to lip-smack, sip, pound, whatever. ""Tasty"" does not do it justice.

Finish:
Bodied enough to deserve the word 'complex' but so well-married you wouldnt know it if you were a n00b to brown town. That itself is impressive,  as is the clean and short smooth finish itself is comprised of. Incredible under $40usd IMO.

I will note for you deep readers that this bottle was not as good as the one I had before this. It had different packaging ever so slightly. The one I drank  before was 4.5 alllllll day, this one gets 4. Main reason is body on older one was SO much more distinctive and charactered. WOOD, stone fruit, enticing hints and notes from BOTH in ways the newer bottle WISHED it had. I try to be very strict in points past 3.5/5 so to me the 0.5 is a big deal in a world where we ignore cost. Cost considered it's a whatever.

if you need a bottle that tastes like $100 but dont wanna spend: buy it!!!!"

3.0,"So I have both the pre 2017 bottle and the recent 2019 Viking bottle. I drank both back to back and now I understand all the hate on the new vintage. They are very different expressions. I am not sure if it is because they had more old stock in the older version, got popular and went with younger spirits or if it is just the normal variation of a small distillery that got very popular.

Pre-2017 bottle has much more character. Very spicy and peppery on the palate. Not so much sherry, little smoke on the finish. It was more complex than the current dram.

The Viking bottle was more sherry forward and had some sulphur tones. It was less adventurous and more floral. A very different dram but still very drinkable.

They are both good whiskys but I get how people who loved the old HP 12 would not like the new. It tastes that different. The old is probably a 3.5 and the new is probably 3 so I am going with a 3. If you can find the old HP 12, grab it. Much more flavorful and fairly well balanced but still brash and young. The newer is much more subdued and more sherry forward."

4.0,"What is the greatest Scotch?

My pick is still Lagavulin 16 Year Old (though my personal affection for Poit Dhubh 21 Year Old has swelled substantially after recent tastes).

And even if there are quite a few other Scotches I’d think of first if ever the question was posed – and I’m passably informed of the typical top tier – Highland Park 12 is the one I’ll often offer to someone asking for a recommendation.

An air of wispy smoke, toffee, honey, cranberry and a mountain potpourri of sprightly heather, bracken and flowers. A tinge of paint initially, so I would advise allowing this to breathe for a short while. A sweet, honey taste with some oak and maritime notes. A light, pleasant sweet and smoky finish that tails off with a Ceylon tea that adds a dainty, dry briskness.

In fact, this is the whisky for people who say: I don’t like smoky whiskies. This is the text for the teacher; the manuscript for the missionary. The vital tool one requires to convert those horrible heathens.

Haven’t had it yet?

Quick, save yourself, before it’s too late."

It's a great whisky with a good all-rounder balance."

5.0,"Honey is the predominate note on the nose, with a ton of other elements weaving in and out of it. Vanilla and floral notes form the second-layer, with a peppery quality lurking behind that. Some citrus notes never fully came into focus, and there is a hint of cereal and heather that teases right at the end. The sherry influence is obvious but the nose is not overwhelmingly sweet and the longer it sits the more brine comes out on the nose. The palate is such a surprise. Peat smoke shows up predominantly and unexpectedly, fighting aside any sweetness from the nose and bringing more wood with it than the nose would suggest was possible. The brine also comes to the fore and initially lends the smoke a salted meat quality. As the long finish progresses, the smoke turns slightly ashy even as apple and the honey-heather-cereal note from the nose makes a bit of an appearance. The finish is pretty long, with the whisky coating the mouth and that slightly ashy taste leaving me with memories of an hour after smoking a cigar. Throughout the taste there was an element of orange that never quite settled in one place or even particularly came into focus. For not generally being a fan of sherry influence on Scotch this really hits the sweet spot for me, mainly due to the sherry influence being really muted on the palate while still providing some great spicy fruit notes on the nose. Despite the fact that I really can't put a firm finger on any of the notes, this is easily my favorite Scotch and the first whisky I've rated a 5, which for me means something I would actively miss if it goes away and that I always want to have a bottle of."

3.5,"Citrus, sweet, balanced"
4.25,"I know many would not consider HP12 to be heavily peated Scotch, but no one can deny it's peat presence. The way my palate works, this is about as peaty you can get and for me to be able to pickup the other flavors. And what wonderful, rich, deep flavors they are. There is a strong honey malt, fruit, wood, a touch of sherry, and is all tied together with peat smoke vibrancy. Really good!!"
1.75,null
4.25,"Second taste edit: compared to the 18, it’s not as rich, it’s less mature (by that I mean sharper edges), and the oak comes through more. It’s not quite as complex either, but although it plays fewer notes, it played them damn well. 
On the nose, you get smoke and pungent fruit. Think prune or raisin. On the palate, it’s a savory, briny, chewy iodine note. The finish is quick, as far as the whisky oiliness is concerned, but the smoke lingers on the corners of my tongue. It tastes like a smoked turkey sandwich on some kind of rustic, home-baked bread."

4.75,"Believe the hype. This is a great single malt Whisky. 

First of all, its marketing is marvelous. i just love it. there is a whole experience around it, making it not a simple beverage, but also a story to tell. If you visit their website you'll find its history there, filled with smugglers myth. Then i strongly recommend you'll sign into their ""inner circle"" where your photo is suposedly posted in a wall in their destillery. The most beautiful part is that i signed in about two months ago and i received yesterday a pin with the brands logo on my mail box, HERE IN ECUADOR where the post office is very ""inexistent"".

Well, now lets rate this baby. On the nose is very fruity and pleasant. THE BOX SAYS THERE IS PEAT ON IT, i did not find it. 

On the nose you will find a very strong prune aroma, that fills your nose. there is also a citrus aroma, oranges and lemon, and there is cream of some kind, like vanilla cream. 

On the palate the real magic appears. very complex VERY VERY BALANCED. Everything happens at the same time, hotness, spicyness, sweetness, feeling like medium bodied but sometimes full bodied, a lot of old wood but very pleasant, prunes and oakyness, the more you taste it the sweeter it gets. The finish is absolutely astonishing, very long, the longest finish on a whisky i have tasted so far, full of oakyness and almonds. spices are also present, very pleasant, very well done. I just loved it. I want to share it with friends but i also dont want to do it since getting my hands on this bottle is very hard on Ecuador. totally recommended. GET YOUR HANDS ON IT.
