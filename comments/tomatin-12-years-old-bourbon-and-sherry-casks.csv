3.25,"Zoete whisky. Lekkere smaak, weinig afdronk. Proef de smaak van gras"
4.25,"Tomatin is usually a lovely whisky. This is no exception to that rule. I believe this is a new 12 expression that intends to become the core for that age in this distillery. This whisky has been aged in a combination of bourbon and sherry casks. 

Bottled at 43%abv.

On the nose, coffee, dulce de leche, vanilla, red fruits, Some citrus developing, Sider, Watermelon. After first sip: Chocolate & Toffee. Very very nice aroma.

On the palate, Vanilla powder, Green apples, Sider. Very pleasant but maybe too Straightforward.

Aftertaste feels like your typical highland malt: Honey, Hay, Vanilla powder, Ginger spice and Tobacco.

Overall this is a good dram, specially for the price. 86 over 100."
