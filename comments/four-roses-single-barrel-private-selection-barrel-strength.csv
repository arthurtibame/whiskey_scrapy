JE warehouse, 15-3D barrel

This is my first four roses single barrel private selection and I gotta say that I'm blown away.   I found it at my local Costco and it's so much better than I thought it would be especially at that price point.

I enjoy barrel strength, most notably Booker's, and usually sip them very slowly to get the full effect.   This one goes down so smooth and is easy to drink.  I'm not great with descriptors but it's full, rich and fruity.   Peach up front followed by cherry on the finish.  Never really put those two together like that.  I went and looked up the OBSQ recipe because I was so intrigued.   I didn't get much of the floral notes or the rye spiciness.   It was just really well balanced.   Now I've gotta find more of these and try some of the other recipes."

______________________________________________________________________________________________
Nose:  Cut red cedar wood, pine and forthright rye spice, crystal clear in typical FR fashion.  Some dry spices too including cinnamon nutmeg and cardamom. Lots of smoked sweet hickory, intertwined with caramel, and big umami notes which I absolutely love – almost meat marinade like in nature and the hickory is phenomenal.  Along with the umami is sweet cooked corn that is very pleasant.  That sweetness then evolves into sweet & sour – sour hard candies, like Warheads.  Lemon, lemon juice, grilled pineapple mixed with almond and cashew butter, nutty raisin bread dusted with more crushed nuts and spent peanut shells, including the red skins.  Firm layers of oak and sweet wood lay down a balanced foundation with sea salt, Christmas spices and buttered french toast – breakfast and dessert in a glass.
  ______________________________________________________________________________________________
  
  Youthful and possessive in it’s 8 year & 9 month swagger.  I’m being drawn more and more to younger whiskeys as my palate has progressed over the years, to the extent that I almost prefer bourbon under 10 years old.  This expression of FR is the perfect testament to why this is, exerting layers and layers that you could nose for easily 30 minutes.
  ______________________________________________________________________________________________
  
  Palate:  Sticky sweet.  Oily, rich, dense and meaty with a lot of weight.  Rye, cedar & oak spices with this wet mentholic note start on the tip of your tongue, then proceed to cover your entire mouth.  The meat marinade note from the nose is hear but it’s sweeter – more savory and sugary sweet.  Charcoal, barrel char, black licorice, treacle, green rye grains, corn and tons of smoke.  This could be the smokiest bourbon I’ve had to date, perhaps from the hickory that is so assertive starting on the nose, but is ever present here as well.  Warm and inviting.  The overall balance of rich sweetness to smokey dryness is phenomenal.  The palate rounds out before the finish with just beautiful smoke, and a pleasantly sour and savory finish.
  ______________________________________________________________________________________________
  
  Finish:  Sweet and smokey with a long finish.  Mesquite, chocolate covered peanuts with a pinch of salt sprinkled on top.  Spice and smoke fight for dominance in waves as you exhale. Bitter black coffee, oak and thick caramel.

5.0,"This review is for an OESK recipe private selection from Hi-Times Wine Cellar, aged 10 years and 1 month, and bottled at 59.1% ABV.  Four Roses Private Selections have to be some of the best values in the bourbon world -- $70 for a barrel-proof, 10-year bourbon is hard to find in today's market.  Complexity and chocolate are the standout characteristics for me from this bottling.  There's a lot going on in its boozy power punch of a nose.  The strongest aromas are cedar wood, chocolate fudge, and vanilla.  That chocolate fudge is really the star of the show as I go in for a few more whiffs.  I love bourbons and scotches that have pronounced chocolate notes, and this bourbon delivers with a very sweet, rich mélange.  This is a French dessert bar whipped into liquid form.  There is also an oily or gassy edge to the nose, almost verging on the smell of a grill right after igniting it with lighter fluid.  The first time you sip this, that classic honeyed bourbon flavor will whet the palate for future forays.   Further sips reward the taste buds with Aztec chocolate filled with chilis or crushed red pepper -- this is a spicy and hot bourbon!  Unlike Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, which is an oak monster, Four Roses has comparatively mild woodiness, although there is a respectably firm backbone of woody flavors.  I also don't detect as much fruitiness as I got in standard Four Roses Single Barrel, which features the distillery's OBSV recipe.  This bourbon is heavy on the rye spice in spite of the fact that it's the lower-rye mash bill, perhaps because the K yeast supposedly highlights spice notes.  The warm finish concludes with notes of cherry, rye spice, vanilla, and oak after the initial sweetness fades.  Those notes of cherry and vanilla did not show up on the palate for me, so they added another layer to this bourbon.  It's a surprisingly fruity and mildly drying finish, and it concludes with a ghostlike reminder of that pronounced chocolate note.  Delicious."

Notes: Four Roses has always been a bottle that is readily available, so every time I would go to the liquor store, I would typically grab for something a little more “rare.” I have learned that I have been missing out. Binny’s pick a great Barrel with this one. It is such a smooth refreshing pour of whiskey. The delicate fruitiness advertised in the OBSV recipe isn’t as prevalent as I would have thought, but the blend of oak and rye spice from the 9 years in the barrel and 35% rye mashbill make this a home run for me. Also, if I didn’t ready this was over 120 Proof, I wouldn’t believe it, every flavor in this bottle is balanced well enough to where the heat from the alcohol isn’t even something you will notice so drinking neat is the way to go for me! Lastly, the price is extremely reasonable so if you see OBSV on the shelf, please get it"

Nose: On the nose I found very strong vanilla, with caramel, banana, and butterscotch notes.

Taste: The palate was very punchy. Heavy oak and licorice notes were what stood out mostly.

Opinion: Though this 59.1% abv and over 9 year old bourbon was not necessarily my favorite, I can see this being very pleasant and enjoyable to others! It was complex and had a lot of character while still staying true to the Four Roses taste profile. All in all, I greatly enjoyed the tasting event, and can't wait to see those of you near Colorado Springs at the next one! Sláinte!"

This receipe features the Four Roses low rye mashbill (75% corn, 20% rye and 5% malted barley) and spicy yeast strain. 
Upon entry you are hit with a big spice note (black pepper and rye) which swells and threatens to go out of balance. However as it rolls over you get some lovely butterscotch and toffee notes. Cigar and clove on the ridiculously long finish. Finish lingers for ages and has a big Kentucky hug!
For the proof it's very smooth and not hot. Adding some water didn't really improve it and I would recommend drinking this one neat.

4.75,"Having not seen these available in the metro Phoenix area for the last year or so I was happy to see my local BevMo! select a barrel. This particular selection is the OESF reciepe (lower rye mash and floral yeast). It's aged for 9 yrs and 2 months and clocks in at 59.7% abv. Now, my local BevMo has a great track record picking solid store picks and the price is reasonable for this one (granted not as amazing as the price I paid with the Costco selection) so this was an easy decision to pick up. 
The only other recipe I have tasted is the OESK and that one was definitely a spice bomb! For this one since it has a floral yeast I am expecting softer and sweeter. 
On the pallette this is definitely the case. Big caramel, plum and cherry notes are initially evident. We then get mint, grass and oak. Finally on the very long finish it's a floral potpourri with the caramel and oak returning. This one is oily and goes down very easy! Much easier drinker then the Costco pick. That one really improved with ice, for this one ot would be a sin to dilute it. It's a wonderful dram as is. I think go forward this will be my go to recipe. I love the floral elements (think a cask strength IW 15)! Cheers all!"

It's a bit darker caramel color than my single barrel. The nose is strong with a sort of ether, wood, and maple. It hits pretty hard up front, but a little less in subsequent drinks. It's a high proof and that quality comes right through. The burn is there. It gives you a fair kick of spice, but it's rather short-lived. The alcohol is most present aside from a sort of maple syrup and woody flavor. It's not very sweet. Finishes with a little linger of orange peel and wood.

Honestly, I like the single barrel better. However, for the experienced bourbon guys who like stronger, stouter drinks, maybe this is better in their opinions. An ice cube made a nice difference for me. The proof in this drink reminds me a little of the Knob Creek 120, which is a very good bourbon, but just a little strong for me to like as a regular drink.

It's very good quality drink, but not perfectly aligned to my style. To me, this is kind of a more serious flavor. There is some complexity, but not much. It's not a playful, fruity drink. It's good in sort of a formal bourbon kind of way. Four Roses doesn't ring quite like an alpha male name, but this is an alpha-male drink."

5.0,"(As with all my reviews, these notes come from a blind tasting)

Amber, clear, and sediment free appearance with legs that go from its ass to the floor.

The nose is an insta-burn but there is an earthen spice (maybe dill) wood, and theater on the nose making me thing there is a good bit of Rye in here but leaving no doubt its a high proof whiskey.

The flavor is incredible.  Warm but not too hot with a spicy sweet taste and spicy dry finish.  THis is a total package Whiskey for me and everything I look for from proof to flavor, mouthfeel to finish.  I have to go no, this was a store pick and im about to go get every single bottle they will let me buy.  Perhaps the first time in my life I have truely experienced a real ""Honey Barrel""

Palate: (5.0)  Flavor bomb of rich stewed fruit.  Tastes like home made concord grape jam, dark plumbs, and bit o honey.  Mouthfeel is rich and juicy as if you actually bit into those fruits.

Finish (4.75):  Long, grapey, may fool you that it had some type of a sherry cask finish but it didn't.  No burn but a beautiful warming.

3.25,"""The One"" picked for Julio's Liquors in Westboro, MA. OBSQ recipe, Aged 9 years 7 months, bottled at 58.6%, Warehouse TN, Barrel 36-3M.

N: Ginger, cinnamon, brown sugar, sourdough yeastiness, sharp rye intensity.

P: Definitely needs a splash of water to open up at this proof with the high rye mashbill. Lots of cinnamon, licorice, chili flake, some doughy pastry. After the initial spicy entry, fairly quiet. Not as vanilla and molasses forward as the lower rye recipe.

F: some oak barrel presence, more of the familiar spices, still burns pretty hot after dilution.

I'd be interested to try an ""E"" recipe at barrel strength. The OBSQ really takes your head off at this proof. Even with the water, I can't say I prefer this over the standard Single Barrel. The $30 premium for this private selection makes it more of a crap shoot."

all. Finish is medium though and I wouldn’t quite call it dry but it’s not sweet either at the end. 

Overall another great single barrel selection. I like this better than my previous bottle from last year. A bit more complex and very well-balanced from nose to finish. This bourbon, a well-matured 10-year, could easy take on many of the limited releases of even older age that frequently sell for hundreds of dollars more.
