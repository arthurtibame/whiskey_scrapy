2.0,"Bought on a lark while I was visiting Atlanta, this is water clear whiskey with a slightly sweet and cut grass nose. Flavor is exactly what you'd expect from corn whiskey purchased in a mason jar. Smoother than expected actually but a non-descript whiskey. Taste is more of alcohol and grass than anything else."

1.0,"Tastes, and smells like candied syrup. I know this is supossed to be a play on moonshine, because distilling the real deal is illegal, but this is just terrible. This does not deserve the title of being whiskey. I actually felt bad for the drain when i poured it out because it had to endure such a terrible tragedy. If a couple of drunk frat guys decided to start a distillery this would be the ugly redheaded lovechild it would become. Your better off drinking a decent whiskey, pissing it out, then drinking the aftermath from the toilet. You honestly could not tell the difference! I would not recommend this even if someone actually paid me to drink it!"
