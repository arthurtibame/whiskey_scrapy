I have the ""B"" cask variety - coconut, vanilla, brown sugar, dark chocolate, hints of something vegetal, maybe hay or heather, and the barest hint of campfire. It's remarkably smooth and creamy with a lingering coconut finish. I can easily imagine ending a rich meal with a glass of Hedonism. That's the positive. The negative is the cost. At $100/750 you aren't going to break the bank picking it up, but its similarity to some nicer bourbons at twice the cost give pause."

Old fashioned dry ginger ale, vanilla butter-cream frosting and something rich and sharp underneath it all that reminds me of Irish cream or white cheddar popcorn. Once on the palate it's unbelievably smooth, even buttery, with some grilled peppers and coconut that carries through the finish with faint (very faint) wisps of sweet charcoal smoke. It's a fascinating, creative and quality dram, for sure, but I still can't justify the overweight price tag.

5.0,"Here's to another chance to review this beautiful blended scotch from the geniuses at Compass Box.  Hedonism.  I originally tried this blend in their wonderful 5 flavor sample pack.  It was a very nice presentation that, while somewhat expensive, did showcase their core whiskies perfectly.  Hedonism and Peat Monster were clearly the stars of the sampler, but the other 3 were also quite tasty.

Anyway, onto Hedonism...this is an incredible blend of several Lowland malts that are then aged again in ex-bourbon casks.  Most Lowland whiskies I've had are very light on the nose and the palate.  Soft, floral and mostly sweet.  Hedonism takes those qualities and adds a layer of American bourbon overtop and melds them together quite gracefully.  Vanilla, lemon merengue pie, marshmallow and a bit of fresh oak are all present on the nose and follow through to the palate.  The finish is soft and sweet, lingering just long enough to make you crave another sip.

I've had several newer blends from John Glaser and CBW so I can't say this is my favorite from them, but it sure as hell is a wonderful dram to finish off dinner with in place of a decadent dessert.  The price is also pretty reasonable so there really is no reason to keep a bottle of this on hand for guests that want to venture into scotch.  This would make a big splash at an entry level tasting event.  Seek it out and take that step into higher quality blended whisky, you won't be disappointed.  

Thanks to Paul for sending me another sample of this one.  I'm so glad I could give it another go and improve on my initial review on Barreled.  Thanks, brother.  Cheers."

4.0,"Considering this is all grain blend, it's really silky smooth.  My very few experiences with grain whiskey (Nikka  and Teeling) have been unimpressive because of the rough edges.  I think what Glaser has done here is prove that not all grain is harsh i f blended correctly.  This is definately a hot weather sipper---you get coconuts, vanilla and butter smooth creaminess.  Finish is short and smooth.   Now---if we pivot to value for money...I'm not sure this is a convincing buy considering it's all grain, little to no complexity.  Instead his Great King street is a much better VFM.  If you look at the numbers, data kind of proves the VFM.  Price per avg rating is 18 in Great King st, while 19 here.  (Lower the number, the better VFM)"

First fill casks...well really 2nd if its ex bourbon and used for whisky are a favourite of mine. Sherry, bourbon whatever. Give me what the cask has to offer and give it in spades. This is a good cask it seems.  The vanilla and honey notes mute that damn turpentine note I was getting from some of the other compass box range. Do i prefer it to the spice box...I think maybe not. It's slightly same same to other whiskies out there given the strong honey and vanilla. I really think I need to compare to a similar profile scotch malt to accurately assess but for now I'll give this a high 3 which translates to a 4"

3.0,"From Compass Box sample box containing five different 50mL vials from their “core range.”  I was able to get this on sale for $30.  Hedonism is the most expensive in this package, at ~$140 for a 750mL bottle.  Hedonism is a vatted grain whisky, which is super unusual.  There is only one “mainstream” one: Haig Club, which I’ve never tried because it is expensive and everyone except David Beckham believes this is garbage.  Grain is typically thought of as the cheap filler in blended Scotches, but Compass Box has set out to prove that a properly matured grain can be quite palatable.  
    
    NOSE: Sweet and pleasant.  Meat from old brown coconuts, vanilla, caramel, crème fraiche.  Wood varnish is in the background and because I do not have a sweet-tooth, this was the most interesting note.  Fruity notes are pears and apples, but these are subtle.  This smells a lot like an expensive bourbon.
    
    PALATE: Arrival is a big wallop of coconut.  As you sip more, it becomes very much like a bourbon.  Adding water speeds up this transition.  A floral oakiness is in the background.  This is very, very sweet.  Almost no salt.  It needs salt.
    
    FINISH: Bourbon, but better.  Caveat is I’ve never bothered to spend hundreds of dollars on a bottle of bourbon, and now I have even less reason to, because if I felt that insane, I would just buy a bottle of Hedonism.  Coconut and vanilla remains, but there is a pleasant rich caramel liqueur that lingers.  Imagine a Bounty chocolate bar filled with alcohol… with some nutmeg and cinnamon.
    
    VERDICT: Dessert drink, definitely.  I’m just not sold on grain whisky.  Old Girvan single grains are even more coconut-y.  It’s hard to back a spirit trying to approach a Pina Colada.  I’m almost thankful Hedonism is a little more youthful.  This is definitely better than the rubbish they fill Johnny Walker bottles with, but I am on the fence about picking up a full bottle.  I think I can do better with $140 to spend on an actual bourbon.  MARK: 82/100."

5.0,"Pale hay in color, with sweet notes of honeydew, some toffee/caramel, and beyond that cereal/bakery notes on the nose. Plantain, green apple, and coconut abound. Incredibly light on the palate, a sweet mix of coconut, hazelnut, toffee, amidst a background of vanilla and butterscotch. A confectioner’s delight, multifaceted and complex. The finish lingers, with buttery toffee and vanilla notes outlasting the coconut flavors. For such a light and airy whisky the finish is surprising in both depth and character. 

Designed to grab the attention of the Scotch whisky world, Hedonism brings grain whisky to the spotlight and does so in a major way.  An assemblage of sweet baked goods, melons, and nut flavors, Hedonism draws out the true potential of often-overlooked grain whisky. A true case study in blended grain whisky."

4.0,"Nose: Vanilla, coconut, soft fruit (peaches, apricots), and brown sugar. There's an elusive fragrant wood note overlaying everything, but it's more like cedarwood or sandalwood than oak.

Palate: An arrival that is uncommonly silken, smooth, luscious and sensual. As it evolves flavours of crème brûlée, white marshmallows and coconut pudding emerge, balanced by a candied cereal and warm cinnamon and ginger spice note.

Finish: Medium/long. Vanilla and cream with some spiced cereal in the aftertaste.

A very seductive and, yes, hedonistic whisky that is one of the stars of the Compass Box range. Together with Spice Tree and Peat Monster it virtually defines the term ""artisan blend"".  The recipe is remarkably simple for a blended grain whisky, the components are of very high quality, and maturation has been handled with a master's touch.  You could almost call this ""essence of top-class oak in a solution of premium whisky"".

ADDENDUM - One year later and I'm just finishing off the bottle I opened for this review. It has oxidized with considerable grace and there is greater heavy mellowness now than when it was first opened but the whisky still has that characteristic Compass Box freshness.

4.0,"Review from Barreled from November 2016

Part four of the Compass Box Whisky sampler pack reviews. 

This NAS whisky is a blended grain scotch, meaning it has no malted barley components, and if I read correctly, it is the first of its kind. As always this is natural color and non chill filtered. The color is pale straw and virtually identical to The Peat Monster. 43% ABV. 

The information provided by CBW states it is composed of 70% eastern Lowland single grain and 30% western Lowland single grain. The casks are 100% first fill American oak. 

The nose is simply fantastic. Intense vanilla with caramel and coconut. Light creamy pastry and custard notes. Gentle oak and slightly floral. This is like nosing an empty glass that had bourbon in it 5 minutes ago. Light lemon citrus and a slight mango-pineapple fruitiness. Very complex. Showcases the superior casks that CBW sources. 

The palate is soft and gentle but not at all weak tasting. Again, vanilla and oak, with a corn sweetness very similar to bourbon but without the heat. More custard and light citrus like lemon or grapefruit peel. If you can imagine if the Scottish made bourbon and matured it in refill casks instead of virgin wood like actual bourbon, that's what this is. Exceptional whisky. 

The mouthfeel starts out slightly creamy and turns very dry. It coats the mouth. 

The finish is medium length but the dry mouthfeel goes on and on. 

I wasn't sure what I would be getting when I opened this sample bottle, but wow was I surprised at the complexity and wonderful aromas and flavors. If I see a bottle of Hedonism on a shelf I would not hesitate to grab it. If I'm not drinking something heavily peated or one of maybe 4 bourbons, I want to be drinking Hedonism. Of course that won't always be the case because I love to explore new bottles, but this is really great stuff. Cheers!

Addendum: after having tried so many more whiskies since I initially wrote this review, I have to say that there are many excellent drams out there I would love to make my everyday drink of choice, but this one still holds up."

5.0,"Creamy Vanilla dominates the nose.  Palate isn’t all that complex but this one doesn’t need to be: more Vanilla and a moderate rye spiciness.  Extraordinarily smooth.  Taste more like a malted American Whiskey as it lacks the Peat of a traditional Scotch.  If you’re a Bourbon, Rye, or just an American Whiskey drinker in general like me, this is a fantastic scotch to have on your bar.  Best enjoyed Neat."

5.0,"Grain whiskies get a bad rap in the scotch whisky world, but that's why an accomplished blender like Compass Box set themselves the challenge of debunking that perception.  This is a bravura performance from John Glaser, Compass Box's mastermind.  I just criticized Compass Box yesterday for having some mediocre blends, but this is not one of them.  Hedonism is a bit one-note, but the note is spectacular and clear, and Glaser deserves credit for purifying it to this point.  Hedonism tastes exactly like vanilla, more than any other whisky I've ever tried.  It is like a vanilla-heavy bourbon, if you then stripped out the toffee or caramel notes.  It is like hearing a perfect, pure note from a well-tuned piano or violin.  It's beautiful to behold.  The finish reveals some aged oak lurking in the profile, but that vanilla is the absolute star here, and it's virtually a one-man show.  It's a credit to Compass Box that the one note not only keeps my attention, but captivates it."

5.0,"Hedonism succeeds in putting Compass Box on my whiskey map with striking craftsmanship and a giant ‘X.’

It’s truly delightful. I genuinely wish I could keep this one around at all times. On the nose, you’ll find rich toasted notes, vanilla, caramel and coconut.

On the palate this dram is creamy and incredibly smooth. The essence of vanilla cake batter, as called out by my fellow tasters, brings an airy lightness. The whiskey itself isn’t thin, rather, this element brings a full mouth feel and a welcomed presence without being overbearing. This one enters with humility, then opens up with intriguing confidence. 

As you finish, Hedonism lingers, allowing you to enjoy the experience in stereo. There’s a lot of depth to explore and this one doesn’t leave you wanting more. Simply stellar.

5.0,"Second Whisky for tonight. God damnit this one is amazing. It really deserves the scores it's getting. The nose starts with a light vanilla, heavy coconut cream, dash of cinnamon and some honey sprinkled over that. It somewhat reminds me of Raffaelo, you know those coconut-cream-almond sweets. And that's exactly how it tastes for me too. Honey, vanilla, loads of slightly toasted coconut, heavy cream, almonds and some cinnamon. No burn, no aggressivness, just delightful pleasure without too much sweetness. And an aftertaste that stays forever, bitter, creamy, coconut. If you have a chance, or if you are debating which Compass box to get....this one is a strong contender. Love it."

Natural color

Nose: Vanilla, and lots of it. Also cream soda, faint caramel and cola notes.

Taste: rich, sweet and creamy, with a deep, delicate and decadent vanilla taking center stage. Also walnut/almond; tiramisu; graham cracker; coffee bean; nutmeg; touch of cinnamon and tapioca pudding.

Finish: long and warming. Vanilla rides with you all the way to the end, along with a touch of dark chocolate, graininess, slight peppery barrel note and cinnamon apple cider.

Value: $100. Worth it.

Final thoughts: If you have a sweet tooth, this is the dram for you. This is a ”dessert whisky” at heart, but i find this enjoyable at any time. While not quite as interesting as it’s close (and cheaper) cousin The Spice Tree, this single grain blend from Compass Box is worth putting on your radar for the simple reason that it’s just so damn delicious.

4.25,"Number one question-can the feds get us? No, but shoutout Hov. The number one question is actually could this be my favorite Compass Box Whisky? Short answer is no, but dependent on my mood, the weather, the time of the year and a myriad of other variables, that answer could change. The allure of the bottle is a good place to start; shit looks eloquent, but approachable. The nose provides vanilla and some citrus off top. Also smells like a pan being prepped with some melted coconut oil. The palate is rich and creamy and I can taste the grain- and i dig it. Spice at the finish also gives it some preferential treatment for me. 
Final Verdict: 8.5-8.75 out of 10. I enjoy it and am going to savor this bottle, but am not going to rush and re-up when this is finished. Good bottle to have for occasions."

Cool whip, vanilla ice cream and toasted coconut. Amazing."
4.0,"Batch MMXIX-A (2/2019).

Pale straw in the glass.  Relatively thin body with a touch of oil in the legs.

Creamy vanilla nose with a gently spiced citrus.  Cereal notes.  Surprisingly, enough kick to keep you from nosing too deep.  Clearly a grain whiskey through and through.

On the tongue, vanilla cream dominates with caramel and a hint of oak giving the strong impression of toasted marshmallow.  Persistently zesty around the mouth and edges of the tongue... another thing I tend to associate with grain whiskeys.  Very well-balanced and quite nice - has all the key components from a sweet dram, but also very straightforward.  Has all the categories of flavor and mouthfeel, but not layered.

Verdict - very good offering, crowd-pleaser, and certainly well-made, but reminds more of an Irish style than what I hope for in a scotch.  Will enjoy the bottle but likely not replace for $100+.  Spice tree is more memorable and half the price."
4.25,"This was a lucky find to come across one of the sample vials by itself. 

This is a subtle and smooth whiskey. Low sting, but still tasty. The nose is a mix of ice cream, apples, light salt and pancake batter. It tastes of citrus, sugar cane, salted crackers and ginger. The finish has a nice spice to it, and goes down smoothly.

It's creamy, spiced, sweet and decadent.

Overall, this is tasty and worth a second pour (and a third)."

Thinking outside the box, being grain and not malt, it has allot of bourbon notes without heavy new charred barrel influence, like if bourbon was put in used barrels."

2.5,"My first Compass Box. My first blended grain. I've long been excited to try one of the masterful blends of the former. I haven't thought much about the latter, but it's an intriguing proposal nonetheless. Here we go.

Nose: Grainy, nutty, and spicy. Walnut, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, vanilla, and shortbread cookie come to mind. Like a spicy Irish whiskey. Even a bit metallic. Hints of orange and coconut. I'd say it's decent at best, but I give it credit for being interesting.

Palate: The orange zest pops to the forefront. Vanilla and toffee behind that. Some walnut and shortbread cookie. Some more coconut. Almond and walnut. Still very grainy and a bit metallic. Once again, respectable, but nothing to write home about.

Finish: Vanilla and orange. Shortbread and walnut. Nutmeg and clove. Some grain, some spice, and a small bit of sweetness and citrus. Cinnamon. Soapy. Metallic. Short. Underwhelming.

If you couldn't tell, I'm not particularly excited about this. Average at every turn. Young, unrefined. 97 on distiller? I don't use an x/100 scoring system, but the score I'll allot this one is far from such.

It's not a bad drink. But it's definitely not an interesting one. I had to pull out the Glenlivet 14, my most recent tasting, just to confirm that my palate isn't off. Certainly is not. At $93, this is a major disappointment. Interesting idea, unsatisfying result."

4.5,"Nuanced, sweet, and smooth, Hedonism tastes more refined than over-indulgent. Compass Box managed to bottle the pursuit of pleasure without pressing their luck. First impressions present a cloying aroma of vanilla marshmallow than settles down and turns to sweet vanilla and basil followed by a palate of sweet vanilla creme and butterscotch. As you allow the whisky to open up there's more basil and sweet florals. I was impressed with the toasted-roasted marshmallow note I found throughout, with just enough heat and herbal/floral to make sure the sweetness doesn't unbalance the blend. A British blending company using Scottish grain whiskies and American ex-bourbon barrels, it tastes like Japanese grain whisky meets Kentucky Bourbon. To improve the score, I would like more body and aftertaste, for sure.

Aroma: Vanilla bean marshmallow & basil
Flavor: Vanilla creme soda, butterscotch, toasted marshmallow, & honeysuckle.
Aftertaste: Medium length and sweet with hazelnut candy, marshmallow & toasted coconut.
Body: Light"

4.5,"A whiskey sample provided by dthom as part of the ""Whiskey Transfer Program"".  What a whiskey!

Nose:  Immediately I'm hit with vanilla cream soda.  Then subtler flavors like orange peel, brown sugar, poached pears, toasted coconut, and a little bit of background grassy note.  

Flavor:  Just like it smells.  Brown sugar and vanilla cream soda, crème brulee, poached pears and apples, like tarte tatin.

Finish: A short finish.  Lightly oaky with a little bit of barrel spice and toasted nuts.  A sweet finish that kept me coming back for more.

Wow this is good.  Definitely a dessert whiskey for me.  I wish it wasn't so pricey.  I keep seeing it for $110 per bottle.  Not the most complex whiskey but I liked that about it.  Sometimes you just want something that knows exactly what it is going for and hits on all cylinders."

4.0,"Review #300.
It's been about a year since I really started to try and expand my whiskey experience, and 9 months since I found the Distiller app. During that time I've tasted some great whiskies, some crappy whiskies, and many in between. To paraphrase someone famous 'Wow! What a ride so far!' 
I have also read many fine reviews and have come to value the many varied opinions I find here. I wish i had the trained nose and palate of some and the eloquence other other to write well articulated reviews. But I am who I am and my generally simple reviews reflect that. 
With that said, on to the review!

Nose: Vanilla, coconut creme and marzipan cookies.
Palate: Silky with vanilla, creme brulee and almonds.
Finish: Sweetness mixed with bitter almond on the medium length finish.

A bit of a let down for #300. I have tasted a few single grain whiskies and have been favorably impressed by the older ones. I had high hopes for this bottle because of its high marks in both the professional and user reviews. It is from batch 2018-B, bottled on 20/06/2018."

Overall good but not great in my opinion. Cheers

3.5,"Lets talk about this one. If grain whiskies are a little scarce, a blended grain whisky is definitively a rarity. It is not a rarity as ""rare & old"" would mean (because compass box is popular and this is one of their core whiskies) but rare as a whisky species. Just for you to understand what i mean, i found myself drinking one after 191 whisky reviews. 

Grain whiskies are made of rye, wheat or corn, and they werent on the market till recent years (20 years or so), because they aren't usually as good as malt whiskies and the whole grain whisky production went to blended scotch expressions. Having said that, vatted grain is very unlikely. 

Compass box has this reputation in the world of blending and they give us ""Hedonism"".

Bottled at 43% abv, it has a pale staw color. Natural, non chill filtered. 

It is a very simple dram.

On the nose, the normal grain whisky notes: butter and corn, maybe wet green grass, petrichor. Only one note was out of the normal and i think it was interesting but not enough to say ""it has an outstanding aroma"": sprite or 7up cola. Yep, it smells like sprite from the Coca Cola Company.  (18 out of 25 points on the nose).

On the palate is not so enjoyable. Creamy feeling, the notes are clove, a hot full sensation but not unpleasant, butter and cereal.

Finish is boring, not long and if it were i dont think i would enjoy having the feeling for long. 

I made a research on this dram, it says its a blend of two different port dundas (different cask that is) and a cameron bridge (never had either before). 

I know there are people that would enjoy it more than i do, but it just isn't my kind of dram. I give this one a 74 over 100 and it is the lowest score from the group of samples i have been tasting lately.

My final thoughts on this one: it feels like it was useless to blend grain whiskies, it tastes as if it were a single grain and nothing interesting came from it, as if it was made just to sell you the experience of ever having a blended grain but not giving you the quality you expect on a whisky. I wouldn't buy a whole bottle, but in its defense, it is better than David Beckham's Haig Club."

3.5,"Strong floral notes followed by almonds and macademia. Is this even a scotch? It toys with being a bourbon. There are wood and vanilla present for sure, along with clear caramel and hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. Smoke and peat are essentially not there. The flavor is rich and robust with wood and nuts, though it does not develop as much as I would have liked. Distiller says there are supposed to be strong fruit notes, but I get little in that area. The flavor is very sweet and it has no flaws. I wish there were a bit more variation from start to finish and that the finish were longer, but it is darned good. I just don't understand it. In a weird comparison, this is definitely better than the Balvenie Caribbean Cask.
It's rich with notable fruit and vanilla mixed with some spices (red apples and nutmeg are notable). It's good, but side-by-side the Glenfarclas 25 is definitely better. It also lacks the interest of the Spice Tree, so I can't really recommend this. It may be creamy and fairly sweet, but it's not amazing. Maybe there's a little coconut in the finish, but it doesn't make up for the strong alcohol in the beginning that is mixed with rather subdued flavors. The Glenfarclas 25 is creamier, smoother, and generally more enjoyable.
The nose is kind of meaty with one cheese that has been left out too long. The palate has a surprising rye character to it with cinnamon, some maple, and vanilla. It's quite bourbony. There is a bit of that old cheese flavor in here too. There is a nice brown sugar, but the whole thing lacks complexity. The whole thing is muddled. There is even a hint of bananas that gives it a kind of rummy element. It just doesn't come together and there isn't anything about it that is especially good. It's extremely creamy and has just the right amount of spiciness, but it isn't vibrant and interesting. A little cereal is present, but it isn't much (I usually like a tad more than this, but this is a minor point). That rye tartness is disconcerting and tastes wholly out of place. Oh, it turns out that this is blended Grain, so that makes more sense. Cinnamon, vanilla, and brown sugar make up a lot of this, giving it a bit of an oatmeal cookie taste, especially with that rye tartness giving it a little fruitiness. I'd like less floral flavor in this since it is supposed to be rich and indulgent.
The nose has some butterscotch, meat, and cinnamon. The palate is kind of mild with lots of mineral and floral notes mixed with saltiness. The cinnamon comes through, but the rye flavor is more than I would like. It's kind of spicy and has some notions of fresh fruit, but there isn't a great deal of complexity here. The butterscotch makes it in, but it is not as present as I'd like. There's a good amount of vanilla. It's kind of oily but it isn't terribly viscous. The apple does come out more, but so does the alcohol. It's a sipper but it's quite a mediocre one."
