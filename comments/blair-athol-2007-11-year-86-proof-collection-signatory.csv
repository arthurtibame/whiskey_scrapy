2.5,"The nose has a moderate richness. It doesn't smell like there's a lot going on, but there's a bit of malt and freshness with a tad of herbal citrus and a slight balancing waft of apricot alongside a bit of young grass smell. The palate is decently sweet and malty with a bit of caramel. It's light like Glen Elgin 21 (1995), but it isn't as smooth and nicely balanced. It is smooth, but it does have some of that citrus youthfulness to it and a bit of that Clynelish waxiness. The palate is very light, but it's nice. It's good and it can certainly compete with something like Glenmorangie The Original, but it's not excellent. There's some grassiness that brings in a bit of cardboard, but doesn't taste gross. There is definitely some alcohol though. I like Loch Lomond 12 a bit better, though. A bigger sip reveals more richness with some increased viscosity and smoke, a lot like Glenmorangie The Original mixed with Clynelish 14. It's solid, but not much more than drinkable."
4.5,"Nose - lemon peel, honey, floral notes and hints of tropical fruit
Taste - vanilla, honey, lemon and dry spices
Finish - the sweetness fades to the background but lingers, the spicier notes come forward, medium heat"
2.5,"Flat body, but interesting after taste with chocolate and vanilla. Very easy and smooth. Interesting but not great."
5.0,Bought in Edinburough.
4.0,"I've tried the Blair Athol  7 year Signatory and found it to be fantastically good, like a top  Glenmorangie bottle in flavors with an unpeated and low char, clean finish.  The kind of Scotch I actually enjoy without putting on my ""scotch drinker"" shoes. 

Edit: my mistake this the actual 11 year 2007 as described ."
