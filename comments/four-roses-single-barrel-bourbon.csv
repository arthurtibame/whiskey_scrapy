3.5,Sharp fruity/citrus (lemony) nose. Spicy upfront and then a fuller cherry finish. Almost like Twizzlers. Great after taste.
4.0,"BACKGROUND: Single Barrel is one of the four expressions in the Four Roses line and joins the traditional yellow label, small batch, and small batch select offerings on liquor store shelves.  The distillery also produces “limited edition” versions of most of its expressions, but they are both pricey and difficult to obtain.

Four Roses utilizes two mash bills and five yeast strains to produce ten different bourbon recipes, and each recipe is denoted by its own letter code.

All Four Roses Single Barrels use the OBSV recipe, which can be decoded as follows:

O = produced at the Four Roses Distillery
B = made with the “B” mash bill comprised of 60% corn, 35% rye, and 5% malted barley
S = straight bourbon whiskey
V = made with the “V” yeast strain, which the company has said produces bourbon with “delicate fruit” flavors.

Because all of the company’s products are made at the Four Roses Distillery and all are aged at least two years, which earns the “straight” designation, only the second and fourth letters in the recipe code change from bourbon expression to bourbon expression.

Four Roses also uses an “E” mash bill, which is 75% corn, 20% rye, and 5% barley, on some of its bourbons.  

The other four yeast strains include “O,” which produces “rich fruit” flavors, “F,” which produces “herbal notes,” “K,” which produces “slight spice,” and “Q,” which results in bourbons with “floral essence.”

The 100-proof Single Barrel retails for $43.99, and though it carries no age statement, a Four Roses press release that I located said the bourbon is “at least” seven-years-old.

I sampled Barrel No. 17-1F from Warehouse No. KE.

NOSE: The nose offers the scent of buttered corn, which seems unusual for such a high-rye mash bill, but it is dominated by strong chocolate covered cherry notes that seem as if I had just opened a box of the Queen Anne Chocolate Covered Cordial Cherries that my parents routinely gifted me at Christmas as a child.

PALATE: The chocolate covered cherry nose converts into an all-enveloping flavor of the same, although a bit of citrus may be detected toward the back of the tongue.  It is a decidedly sweet and pleasant palate.

FINISH: Heat rises on the long finish as if someone is slowly turning up the burner on a gas range, and then it subsides just as slowly.  Oak makes an appearance in the finish along with an aggressive mint flavor, which I often notice in high-rye bourbons.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: Four Roses Single Barrel offers a wonderful mixture of sweetness on the palate and spiciness on the finish.  It is like riding a wave of flavor that suddenly takes an unexpected turn.

I have often sampled single barrel offerings by various distilleries, but none have proven as initially sweet as this Four Roses version.  The company obviously knows what it is doing and has its mash bill/yeast strain recipes dialed in.  

This experience makes me want to sample more of the Four Roses recipes that are on the market.

Given its ready availability, excellent taste, and middle-of-the-road price, I feel that the Four Roses Single Barrel offers excellent value and was money well-spent."

4.0,"Not for the feint hearted, the high ABV packs a punch, but in a nice way that bourbon lovers who like that extra boost of flavor will appreciate. 

Cherries dominant  the sweet nose.  Spices, cherries, and dark fruits on the palate. Lovely big/thick mouthfeel that coats the tongue and lingers. A dash of water tones down the spices a little and brings out even more of the sweet cherry notes on the finish. 

You could pour over ice but that wouldn’t be my recommendation. At around $48 where I live, this is a bargain."

4.0,"This is the standard single barrel OBSV. One of 10 recipes. According to Four roses site, this recipe's flavor profile  should be delicate fruit, spicy and creamy. 

Tasting in GC. Breathing for 15+ minutes. My studying drink for the night.

N(4.5): Dark caramel. Bit of barrel spice on the deeper sniffs. You can safely dive into this without getting punched with ethanol. As the dark caramels fade, I pick up cherries and ....grassy fields. Which is odd, I've only been able to get this from rye and islay. Some creamy nut shows up as well. Unique and complex. Not bold though.
P(3.5):mouth watering. Silky around the tongue. Gentle sweetness. A tiny bit of spice bite. The flavors are mild on the pallet, but how it feels is pretty nice. 
F(4): Oak through out that evolves. Vanilla oak. gentle hug. Brown sugar sweetness comes in. Creamy oak lingers the longest with a sprinkle of white sugar. 

Overall: I enjoy it, not as much as the Small Batch Select. That is in my daily rotation. At $40 it is totally worth it to buy a bottle. I will replace it when it's gone."

4.75,Smooth and just the right amount of sweet
4.75,An exceptional bourbon in all aspects. Nose has an almost “hard candy” type of sweetness to it with a complimentary brown sugar note. The oak is present but not overbearing. Taste is very sweet up front but rounded off nicely by the heat and perfect amount of barrel punch. This will always be a staple in my collection.

3.25,"Another high rated bourbon Ive been eager to try. Poured neat, nose is fresh and sweet. Toasted marshmallow, dusty resin, mild rye spice. Creamy mouthfeel brings strong vanilla caramel (like bullseyes candy with the crème center), sweet pastry and baking spice. Very refined yet still good presence. Finishes with peppery cinnamon, strong oak along with cooling mint. The oak gets more prominent as you go through the bottle. Profile is lighter than some but flavors are still rich and delicious. Tough competition at price paid ($42) and a bit too much pepper and oak for me to give A rating, but I think most will enjoy this bourbon .......84/100"

3.0,"A very sweet bourbon nose.  The palate proves it to be a less so, with a pronounced maltiness that turns into oak on the finish.  The finish has a zap of sweetness followed by a long, spicy zing.  Slightly numbing!  I'm definitely feeling the 50% ABV. Adding water highlights the sweet characteristics which swirl around the oak, finishing with an undefined zinging heat.  This could be an awesome dram for a cold weather climate.  But in sunny California, I won't be buying a full bottle of this anytime soon.

4.0,"Fantastic bourbon! I honestly believe this may be the best one I've had yet and it's only made better by the fact that it is reasonably priced. I've just tried it neat to get it straight taste of it, but I am curious if an ice cube will wake the flavors.

The official review says cherries on the nose and pallette, and I have to agree to some extent. Plum however is much more prominent in my opinion. Wonderfully rich flavor, complex only in the fact that you can taste so many different things and are left pondering what was strongest in that last sip. So you take another sip and repeat the process.  One moment it is cherry, the next plum, then... what is that ? Brown sugar? Butterscotch? I don't know what it is, but I am sure as heck enjoying the repeated tasting to try and find out.

The finish is very oaky and aromatic in the fact that I swear I smell more than I taste. It's not floral nor fruity, but it is sweet and maybe dark dried fruits heavily flavored by the oak.  It's just damnably enjoyable. 

I honestly cannot say enough good things about this bourbon. I don't think that it is a rare bourbon in so much as availability, but it is definitely rare in the fact that it is affordable and very high quality."

Several sips will bring out notes of maple and cherry on the palate. The maple essence remains to the bottom of the glass, helping it drink long and smooth, while rounding off the edges of the light burn you get from this high rye bourbon. For us, an easy bottle to recommend for that beginning drinker or the friend that wants a trusty bottle to share with others."

Definitely recommend letting this sit for a few minutes before indulging. On the nose it's heavy on the ""baking"" spice, some cinnamon, vanilla and a really nice oak note. On the palate you will feel the high ABV but in a nice way. Some fruit cake, vanilla-coke sweetness, chocolate covered almonds. Now this is where it loses me since the finish is really peppery and a little off putting. For my money I would prefer way less spice from my bourbon but at $44 for a single barrel you can't go wrong with grabbing a bottle if you can. I could see this working great in an Old Fashion."

3.75,"The nose is delicate with notes of pears, apples and dried apricots. 
On the palate, it is more into butterscotch, toffee, milk chocolate well balanced with some candied orange peel. Rather spicy on the finish, Christmassy and peppery. 
To note that I was worried with the 50 ABV, it actually remains smooth and the heat isn't that powerful. Worth mentioning it is the first drink from a new bottle and will definitely mellow out"

I must say I’m very disappointed in this particular barrel. I have had others that are much less spicy and easier to drink. Adding a cube or two help tone this one down quite a bit but it’s still not the best. Going to hopefully get a much better single barrel next time"

Color: Amber

Nose: Rye, vanilla, menthol, baking spice, black tea, oak

Palate: Vanilla, oak, over ripe citrus, oily

Finish: Long with oak, vanilla and spice. A wonderful hint of mint rounds the edges

Four Roses Single Barrel is comprised of their OBSV recipe. This delightful dram is rich and silky. On the nose it's as if you've walked into a bakery. Behind it all, you get menthol which encapsulates all the other notes if you keep it on the nose long enough. Taking of sip of juice you're presented with rich oak and vanilla. Hints of over ripe fruits are somewhere behind the scenes. The finish is long with more of the palate on deck and notes of spice. Rounding it all out you get a wonderful wash of mint/menthol leaving your mouth refreshed."
4.25,"Color: Dark Gold, long legs on twirl - oily

Nose: Pickle brine on the initial whiff. A lot of spice is present along with hints of pear, caramel, vanilla and brown sugar. I usually grab onto one scent, and really can’t shake this lovely aroma of pickle brine (picklebacks anyone?)

Palate: An initial burst of sweet and sour gives way to chocolate and cherries. Shortbread and maple syrup by the mid palate, along with candied apples. 

Finish: A relatively quick finish full of oak and spice that leaves the tongue with a mild waxy coat.

Overall: After beginning my journey into the world of whiskey solely through scotch, I’m starting to dabble more in bourbon and have been pleasantly surprised with the results. Four Roses has done a great job with this offering - it’s sweet (but not too sweet), spicy (but not too spicy), and fruity (but not too fruity). This is dangerously sippable, and I’ll be sure to keep a bottle on the shelf.

Finish - Short, warming, some oak spice.

On the nose, this initially smells like a normal sweet bourbon. Letting it sit for a few minutes, I picked up on more subtle floral notes and fruity aromas.

Tasting the whiskey, you are hit with a wall of various flavors similar to a high proof Knob Creek or Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, but without the added alcohol burn. With every sip, you pick up on another savory flavor that makes you want to go back for another. I bet this would scale well at a higher proof. 

This is a fantastic whiskey. It ticks several boxes: it is affordable, complex, and interesting. I want to try a barrel strength version and the various recipes Four Roses offers, but they are not available near me, unfortunately."

This particular single barrel has some nice red hot rye notes. 

Always a fan of 4R."

2.75,"Very strong and full even for the proof in my opinion. It stays around for a while and is an interesting mix of sweet vanilla (mostly on the nose) and spicy. I don’t dislike it, but I probably won’t make it a staple bottle in my collection"

4.25,One of the best for the price and availability. Depending on the barrel it can go from very good to amazing. It's a high rye mashbill so it's more spicy than sweet. But the flavors are great and pretty mellow hotness for a 100 proof. Highly recommended. Much better than the more expensive small batch select imo.
4.0,"“Great bourbon for the $45 price tag

Definitely get lots of spice early on, however it got more sweet as it sat. Good amount of richness as well.”"

3.75,Very good bourbon for the 50$ price point.
5.0,"Best bourbon I've had yet. The 35% rye really brings this one into a flavor profile that I adore. Usually bourbons are too sweet for me. Too much corn sweetness and it gets cloying. This is a perfect blend of corn with rye to enhance the sweetness of the corn to even mellow it a little. Typically I go for rye or scotch to get those big flavors without too much sweet, but this is going to become a staple in my home bar.

Nose: caramel, oak, vanilla, pear, peppery spice

Taste: sweet toffee/caramel, raisins, spices typical of a rye: coriander, green peppercorn, allspice; finishes long and sweet typical of a bourbon but it's a toasted sweetness, like a burnt marshmallow, that doesn't overwhelm with sugar like some bourbons"

3.5,"Nose was a touch of fruit accompanying a good amount of spice. Spice was the major flavor throughout, definitely tastes like a 4R. However a few sips in I noticed a more sweet flavor come through.

This is a decently complex flavor and despite the fact that I generally don’t like spicy bourbons this one is quite good."

3.5,Expected more. Guess I’m not appreciating the Four Roses flavor profile.
4.75,"Once upon a time, I had a bad experience with Four Roses Small Batch and vowed never to get anything from this brand. Luckily, I had a chance to try out their Single Barrel and... I was blown away! All highly rated reviews are true. The Single Barrel has become one of my all time favorite daily sippers. I get this on a regular basis now. However, if I had just one wish, I wish the MSRP was just... a tiny bit lower."

3.5,"🌹🌹🌹🌹 single Barrel, 100 proof.

Neat, but I liked it better with a splash / small cube 🧊 

Nose 👃🏽: light, simple, caramel and some tart citrus honey or classic apricot. , low spice which isn’t typical for me with Four Roses usually. After a few sips can nose slight sweet tobacco. 

Palate - neat gets oak and peat very forward. Much more spicy than the nose. Very long, moderately smoky finish (compared to bourbons...). 

Improved significantly with splash of water... now smooth, sweet ripe black cherry! Not super complex. Definitely sitting more citrus related than wheaty, chocolate oaky.

Pretty hyped up in my opinion, but still enjoyable especially when you open it up with some agua. 

All in all: 3.5/5 🌹🌹🌹🥀

4.0,"My buddy brought this over tonight to share. Thanks Aaron!

Deep deep flavors and smells here

Nose:
It smells thick! Weird description, I know. You’re greeted at the door by the alcohol/ethanol burn. But right after you get this deep buttery maple syrupy toffee honey. Smells like grape jam as well. There’s this metallic/ minty/ sharp end to the nose. 

It’s like ordering a triple chocolate cake with chocolate frosting topped with chocolate syrup. You already feel the richness before you take a first bite. 

Taste:
All the smells I mentioned above slap your tongue. Lots of deep brown sugar flavors. that fruity jam definitely comes through as well. Feels like a whiskey concentrate. If you let it sit, you can taste the oak barrel it sat in, flavors of leather, mint, and coffee. Spice lingers at the end and coats your mouth. 

I really enjoyed this bottle. Bourbons have not been my fave but I’d definitely pick up a bottle of this."

4.25,"Nose: very similar to four roses small batch. Just a tiny bit sharper cherry note.
Taste: VERY different from the small batch. The small batch is smoother and rounded the single barrel has a much sharper cinnamon and cherry bite that hits and holds on for a very long finish. Cinnamon, cherry vanilla. More tannin on the back end as well. None of the artificial sweetener taste that small batch can have.  2nd,3rd, 8th sip in its almost the same every time. Very consistent."
