4.0,"Yet another Talisker doppelgänger!

NOSE:
Woody smoke, less peat, more smoldering resinous pine needles
Savory corned beef and cabbage
Sweet fresh cracked peppercorn

PALATE:
Sharp orange marmalade 
Ocean brine
Barley and malt chocolate

FINISH:
Quick but complimenting
Orange zest and oak

Quite happy to nab the very last bottle I could find, 300 miles from home... and dangerously easy to quaff on these chilly winter nights!

Dry Glass: Roasted nuts and smoky beeswax."

5.0,"This was one of two whiskies I tried at Barrel Proof, at the end of an epic afternoon bar crawl that began after lunch and ended after sunset in New Orleans.  I'm always intrigued when Speysiders experiment with peated single malts given that their specialty (particularly GlenDronach's specialty) is gorgeously decadent sherry bombs.  There's a bit of an arms race between the Islay distilleries and the Speyside distilleries in the sweet-and-peat arena -- can the Islay peat-smoke specialists civilize their barbarian single malts with sherry and other wine-aged casks better, or can the Speyside masters toughen up their rich and fruity scotches with some smoky, rugged flavors?  To my knowledge, some of the most famous Speysiders don't really try, such as Macallan or Aberlour.  They know what they do well and they stick to it.  GlenDronach, however, has ventured forward to challenge the excellent Islay sweet-and-peat scotches such as Laphroaig PX Cask or Ardbeg Uigeadail, and the results are an astounding success.  The peat of the Highlands is different than Islay peat and lends the nose and palate more floral, musky, and leathery aromas rather than an intense, brooding smoke.  This gentler peat blends with the sherry sweetness perfectly.  While the initial flavors upon entry are mostly sweet fruit and there is a lasting note of orange citrus throughout, this dram morphs into something very similar to Laphroaig PX or Lagavulin Distiller's Edition over time.  Compared to Islay exemplars, however, GlenDronach's flavors blend more harmoniously while being less challenging.  This is a symphony of sympathetic flavors as opposed to an exhilarating boxing match between two power punchers.  The finish leaves abiding notes of mint and espresso.  This dram lacks an age statement but, based on taste, this is not a young whiskey.  Bravo, GlenDronach."

3.0,"Minty peat and heather on the nose. Soft and sweet on the tongue. Long zesty finish of pepper, bitter chocolate and tangy grapefruit. Easy drinking with just enough peat to wake the taste buds. It’s a little watery in the mouth to warrant a full bottle in my cabinet but enjoyable enough that I’d happily order it at a bar or give as a gift. I’ve rated it three stars, but it’s at least a 3.5."

4.0,Quite impressed with this NAS effort. Drank against the Benriach Curiositas and this bested it. Lovely oily mouthfeel and gentle peat vs the thinness of the Benriach. Not in the realm of an Islay but nice and unique all the same

4.0,"A sherried Talisker, with sweet peat and charred oak on the palate. The bourbon cask really imparts oak and vanilla.
  
A little birdie told me this expression is being quietly discontinued, so if anyone is interested... buy quickly.
  
  I recommend, especially for the price."

3.25,"Sherry is deep underneath citrus, smoke and sugary malt. Interesting and complex. Worth it for the price."
3.75,"Un nez fumé mais caramélisé, du fruit cuit ou confit. Entre Speyside et Islay, c'est drôle.
Attaque très sèche, tourbée et fumée.
Dans la bouche, on est plus proche des îles alors qu'au nez, on est partagé.
Finale sur la fumée mais encore caramélisée, relativement longue.
Pas inoubliable, mais bien sympa."
4.75,"Fruit up front, smoke on the back. Pretty close to perfection.

If this was double the price it would be good. For the price it's absolutely fantastic."
4.0,"Sherry and muted peat on the nose.  On the palette it’s oily and rich, smoke develops along with spice.  Pepper on the finish, long and spicy. 

This one is like a Highland Park 12 that has been dialled way up on both smoke and spice.  Intense."

3.5,"My bottle of GlenDronach Peated apparently suffered from an identity crisis.  When I first opened this I experienced a typical, spicy ‘Dronach that actually tasted quite good, minus a whole lot of peat influence.  Around 3 weeks into the bottle, and the final 7-8oz, I got blasted with smoky goodness and earthy peat.

This one was a beautiful, polished gold in the Glencairn.  Large, watery drops cascaded down with undefined, runny legs after a good spin.  The initial nose was black pepper, sherry and heat from the elevated ABV.  There wasn’t much depth until some oxidation allowed the heat to dissipate and the earthy, mushroom and wet bog funk mixed with a burned out campfire for the last 1/3 of the bottle (about 3-4 weeks later).

The palate was remarkably peppery and lively initially, with standard GlenDronach spices and vibrant oak notes.  Sherry sweetness played it’s part in subduing the heat, especially later on once the peated whisky came into focus.  The mouthfeel changed from harsh and peppy to oily and rich as the oxidation calmed it over time.  I enjoyed both aspects of this dram while working through the bottle, although I think I preferred the initial tastes more than the second coming of the peat.  Sadly, this is marketed as a peated NAS so I feel like I should dock it some points here.

The finish was medium-long, with lingering sweetness at first, but once the peat aspect came into play it left a funky, barnyard note that made it fall a little in my grading.  The peated aspect has been done better by other Highland malts, IMO.  

Overall, it’s a tale of two drams.  The initial, heavy-spiced sherry part was still fantastic even knowing the juice is quite young.  I’d give that part a 3.5-3.75 star rating, while it fell a bit once the peated whisky came into play.  3-3.25 stars.  The price point was $56- which is average to high for an NAS, so I think I’ll settle for a 3.5 total grade.  Buy it if you’re a GlenDronach fanboy, pass if you like your peated Highlanders with a little more focus.  Cheers."

4.5,"I had this beauty at the distillery, which as you might guess, made the experience a whole lot better, so spare my exciting, glendronach is one of my favorites and i love peat, so i had high hopes for this one. 

Actually, my hopes were battling my skepticism, because i already had the Glendronach peated port wood and it wasn't what i expected. But this one, it delivers the promise. 

Bottled at 46%abv,  it is everything that glendronach stands for.... with peat. 

On the nose: Peat, Prunes, Figs, Ashes, Vanilla; a powerful Malted barley note, Heather and Cocoa butter. Pretty nice if you ask me. 

On the palate it is light but even better than the nose. Puff of smokes, Pepper, Chocolate milk, Toffee and Dulce de leche. Aftertaste is a little short, actually medium-short, and delivers a tobacco with toffee note.

Overall this is a very enjoyable dram, complex enough but easy drinkable, not overly peated but enough phenolic to make peat heads happy. 92 over 100, Glendronach does it again."

3.75,"Nose: Sweet sherry and berry aromas mingle inextricably with a relaxed and shy peat smoke that seems to melt into all corners of the nose without becoming intrusive. Some honeyed notes and fruity aromas waft in the background together with just a touch of vanilla marshmallow.

Palate: More immediately smoky on the arrival than you would expect from the nose and quite sweet. Malty and mildly smoked characteristics begin to dominate as it develops, but this is not an arrogant peat-monster. The texture is pleasantly creamy and there are some light fruity notes and just the faintest salty touch.

Finish: Medium/short. Fruity and gently smoky with a mild salty aftertaste and a surprise chocolate fudge note right at the end.

The nose is very soft and relaxed, pretty even, but nonetheless expressive. Just because it's not a peat-monster don't assume this is weak or anaemic. In fact if anything this is probably genuinely like the character of many Speyside whiskies 150 years ago when a smoky profile was still the norm.

The palate carries a much more forward peatiness but it is that smoky bonfire sort of peat typical of mainland smokies, with nary a trace of medicinal or iodine notes. The PX casks are handled with great skill here, contributing a scintilla of sweet spiciness but not being allowed to control the proceedings. If Laphroaig 10 is Jackson Pollock's Autumn Rhythm No. 30, this is one of Jean-Jacque Hennier's many Red Haired Beauties.

Delightful and seductive - in all honesty I've yet to have a bad GlenDronach. The current fashion is for sledgehammer peated drams, but neglect the subtle ones at your peril.

Tasted from a 30ml sample.

""Good"" : 3.75 stars (very nearly 4)"

3.75,"The nose on this dram is sneaky!  If you didn't know better, you would think you were drinking a milder Islay as it has all the trappings:  vegetable, moss, strong medicinal peat, sea spray, slight lemon zest, and white pepper.   Palate is malty with intense salt, vanilla, crisp red apple, faint tropical fruits, floral, and sweet.  The finish is medium, with more iodine and smoke, lime, and more vegetable and flower character.

It's not as peaty as a typical Islay (although more than most peated Highlands), but particularly in the nose, all the essential characteristics are there.  What does stand out in particular is the salt!  Sharp, although not so much as to break the whisky."

4.5,"The nose: rich fudgey sweetness, honey

The pallete: more rich sweetness, thick honey sweetness like syrup, a slight medicinal note, light citrus 

the finish: sweet, medium length and leaves you longing for more

Overall this is a fine dram, it's like desert in a glass, and one of the most memorable scotches I've had."
4.5,Surprisingly peaty for a highland - very strong smokey nose - strong peated palate balanced with vanillary undertones. Very strong lasting peppery spiced finish with lingering smoke.
3.25,"Of course when I see peated I immediately think of the islay kind of peat, but would be shocked if this even ranged at 5-10 ppm. Otherwise still a fine scotch with a little bit of warmth but not too hot. 

Nice hints of grape from the Pedro ximinez with some nice creamy chocolately finishes. 

Good tang, slight heat but no peat"

4.25,"This is much peatier than I expected- this is like Islay levels of peat.  Behind the peat is the rich sherry nose of Glendronach.

You can taste the smoke and behind it is all the wonderful sherry from the standard Glendronach.

This is a very good whiskey, but I can't help but feeling that the peat smoke throws the balance off and masks the sublime sherry that might otherwise be there.  There is a pleasant edge of black pepper along with the smoke.

As much as I love peat, I prefer this one without it, despite the new flavors that jump out."
