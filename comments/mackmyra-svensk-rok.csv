3.75,"Non-traditional world whiskies are becoming increasingly popular, and Sweden's Mackmyra is among the pioneers. Interestingly, Svensk Rök uses a combination of local peat and juniper twigs to kiln the barley. Bonfire ashes, dried herbs and a variety of green fruits characterize the nose, which almost reminds me of a young Caol Ila. Dry and pungent in the arrival, the taste develops with aromatic peat smoke, wood sap and fruity sweetness before the long and briny finish kicks in. More ash, smoked ham and spices are following. This malt is certainly worth a try!

3.0,"Nose: Neutral with oak and grain.
  Palette: Inoffensive oak and good smoke, but no distinct flavours.
  Verdict: Allright but nothing special.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  

  !Bonus review of VINTERÖK!
    Nose: Smoked salmon and oregano
    Taste: very sharp pine resin smoke that settles down after a bit and goes over to a more deep malty taste.
    Verdict: Too harsh and fishy, sorry Sweden. 2/5"

5.0,"I didn't expect much from this having tried Mackmyra Bruks, but I was amazed by this, tasty, yummy, bitter-sweet with a mix of vinaigre, balsamic vinaigre, hard toffee, rocket, dried herbs, bittersweet pineapple, malty sweet creaminess and pepper, the juniper twigs of course remind me of Swedish food and the juniper berries in gin. The finish is long, elegant and complex. A whisky that truly stands out, as unique as it is tasty! (Try this, ignore Mackmyra Brukswhisky)
EDIT: I own it now and I can pick up wine, cidre, walnut and pecan nuts!"

3.75,"Light smoke with a whiff of a unique taste, that turns out to be uniper. A great and potent, yet gentle, peaty dram."

2.25,At this time the taste was lame and there was almost no any odour.
2.0,"Svensk Rok translates to “Swedish smoke”, so Mackmyra distillery isn’t trying to be creative with the name of this single malt- at all.  This is a peated whisky and they experimented by adding juniper to the end of the smoking process in an effort to add serious spice and florals to the already smoky malt.  It’s natural color and non-chill filtered, while bottled at 46.1% ABV and a 500ml bottle cost me $28.  Not a bad price, even though it’s a small bottle.  It’s pale yellow and makes medium, oily legs and drops while still appearing watery overall.

The nose starts out quite medicinal on the smoky aspect.  There’s a light, Laphroaig-y band aid note that needs to dissipate before you can pick up other subtle nuances like vanilla, Juniper flower, honey and a very faint brine scent.  The palate was surprisingly heavy on the charcoal and cigarettes.  The peat stayed strictly mineral and dry.  Any florals and sweetness were over washed by the cigarette note, which really made this one a tough for me as I despise that smell.  The mouthfeel was rough and abrasive, as well, so the whisky must be quite young.  The finish came across as wet cigarettes that linger on and on (which I did not let last very long- I had to chase it with water after 15-20 seconds).  Medicinal notes and minerals left everything dry and I couldn’t wait to chase this with another sweet, sherried malt.

Overall, this did not suit my palate one bit.  I’ve tasted tobacco on many malts before- and while I wouldn’t describe that as an overly enjoyable flavor IMHO, I have learned to appreciate what it adds to most richer tasting whiskies.  This cigarette note, however, is an entirely different matter.  I just do not like it.  Thankfully, this was a small bottle and after I poured a long term sample (that I’ll never knowingly drink lol) and a few more for possible trades- there wasn’t much left so I dispatched the rest of the bottle very quickly.  I know I won’t replace this one, but I’d still like to try a few more things from Mackmyra- but I think I’ll stick to unpeated malts going forward.  This one gets 1.5-2 stars from me.  Cheers."

4.0,"Quite smokey, not as rounded as other smokey/pleated whiskeys"
3.75,"Citrus and smoky on the nose. Taste is quite intense and adds spiciness. Earthy. Also some sweetness. In general quite nice smoky whiskey, nothing too special, but could be good for opening an evening."
3.75,I'll simply refer to Slainte-Mhaths for the appropriate tasting notes on this as he's summed it up well and I agree with the rating. I'd say this one was my favourite of the night.
3.75,"Ouf, le premier nez est très sympa ! De la fumée, un peu de tourbe, comme du Highland tourbé, j'aime ça.
En bouche, c'est direct dans la tourbe, et pas grand chose d'autre... C'est quand même très rond et plutôt cool.
La finale est agréable et légère, avec du pruneau sur la langue."

3.75,"Nose: Pears and vanilla, very Mackmyra-esque. There is peat/smoke too, but a very herbal and forest-like, fresh yet earthy peat (for anyone into male fragrances; think Tom Ford Grey Vetiver). Just a hint of (pickled?) cucumber as well (!). The nose is more interesting than tasty. 

Palate: Very delicate, yet full of flavour. More pear and vanilla but rounded by the light herbal peat, still maintaining its fruity freshness. The peat is more campfire-like than on the nose, and reminds me of a misty autumn morning in the woods, waking up to an allmost burnt-out campfire, and getting it going again with some slightly moist branches, making the smoke rise high (though the peat is still light).

Finish: This whisky just gets better and better. The lovely herbal peat lingers, infused with just hints of apples and pears. After a while light chocholate can be detected.

Overall: The nose did not impress me too much, but tve palate and especially the finish did. Mackmyra’s spirit holds a fruity, cereal, allmost yeasty quality which is lovely, but very delicate. This take on it maintains both this delicacy and infuses it with an additinal layer of taste. Overall I score it a very solid 3.75 (i.e. really good, just not quite in ”great” territory)."
