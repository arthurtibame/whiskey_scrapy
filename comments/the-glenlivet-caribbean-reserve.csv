2.5,"Well, at 33$ I was willing to try. Not as good as I had hoped, but that’s ok. Fruit first with floral and vanilla. Medium hold with a taste of unrefined burn too. It is just so-so and won’t get again."

5.0,Rum finish gives it enough sweetness to soften the whiskey
4.5,"Light, fruity with a slightly oily mouth feel.  Long finish thats really good at the end of a hot day.  Has a bit of a bite on the back of the throat but a splash of water took care of that."

3.75,"Nose: perfumey and light. Fruit salad, mango, papaya, tangerine.

Palate: hits a little higher than the proof. Rum finish shows with vanilla extract, honey and passion fruit. Classic speyside barley flavor rounds out all the sweetness to make it well rounded.

Finish: short-medium finish. Barley, vanilla and tangerine.

Overall: great well rounded daily supper. Will be great out on the porch in the summer. Good value."
4.0,Decently smooth scotch with light fruit tones.  Easy to drink.
