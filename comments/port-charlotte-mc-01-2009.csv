5.0,"Nose: sweet like a ripe fruit. Maybe peaches and cream. There is a whiff of tabacco, this is heavily peated after all.
 
Palate: big juicy cherry, with a dash of toffee. The peat flows along the whole time at a pleasant pace. 

Finish: sweet and peaty. Long finish that sticks in the back of your throat. 

Overall: perfect dram."
