4.5,"If you appreciate a heavily peated whisky, Ledaig is a brand to consider. This particular expression is a wonder. Think toffee, chocolate, red fruits on the nose and palate. The finish is rather peppery. I find that it opens wonderfully with a spot of pristine water added to the glass. This is a whisky I enjoy before dinner to wind down from the day."
