4.0,"Unique balance of smoke and sweet, aftertaste is heavy on the peat but favorable, vanilla and oak also noted, outstanding!"

4.0,"Like the Port Askaig, this combo of peat and sweet was new to me, and very enjoyable - unlike it, this ups the medicinal band-aids and smoke I love, so I prefer it"

2.5,A little bit more ’punch’ than the original with some extea peat. Otherwise not much better. Same can be said about the 15 year

3.75,"Nose: A round, smoky/peaty welcome.

Flavour: Peat and smoke. Quite a full flavour. Bit of a pepper sting.

Finish: The smoke stays with you for quite some time, pleasantly."

4.0,There is a subtle toasted note from the barrel amongst the peat that gives this a different smoky profile than a typical Islay. Well worth trying.
2.75,"Smells great, like peaches and fruit. Quite heavy, alcohol, iodine, etc."

3.75,"The colour is very same to Inchmurrin, literally no difference. 
The nose contains almost no peat while the taste is full of peat and smoke.
The aroma is heavily spiced with some herbal and medicinal notes combined with wood, malt and vanilla.
The taste is much more peated, what really deflects it towards the Islay style. The sweetness is soft and less prominent than in Laphroaig for example - it tastes like a heavily watered sugary syrup. Many spices again and a boistering pepper. At first it can literally burn your tongue though it has only 46 abv.
It’s closest alternative might really be the Laphroaig 10 but with some important remarks.
The main thing that comes to mind to sum up the feelings is the one where the world of whisky represents the education system and Inchmoan is like a very hard-working student while Lagavulin, Talisker or Bunnahabhain are the professors. Inchmoan 12 tries to be a tough nut, shows much potential but lacks something significant in total. But if you are not ready to pay for the Islay giants then this peated recruit might become a great substitute."

3.75,First time tasting a wee dram of this mildly peaty but somewhat sweet and hint of oak seaweed citrus. Nice long finish.

4.0,"I very much enjoyed this whisky.

Nice touch of citrus, with peat and seaweed for good measure. There's some caramel on the palate, and a very faint nuttiness towards the finish."
