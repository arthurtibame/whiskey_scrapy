4.25,"I was lucky enough to find this in a small bar in Old San Juan Puerto Rico, the best Jefferson's I've tasted so far, nose is oak, nuts and caramel all the flavors are very well balanced it is a mature bourbon. I would buy it if available without thinking twice!"
5.0,"A very nice rich nose, toffee and caramel stood out. On the palate: Cola, dried fruit, some nuts and other flavors coming and going which sadly couldn’t identify all. Finish stays with you for a while, with dark chocolate standing out the most for me. Superb!"
