3.0,"So, I've had this with a steak dinner, then on it's own, and then in a lineup with the first 4 Bookers releases of 2015.  It was FANTASTIC with dinner,  average on it's own and dry like chalk when compared to the other releases in the line.  No kidding, if you like chalk with your oak & burnt sugar then this is the bourbon for you. It's great as a summer bourbon over ice."
5.0,"A nose of oak, caramel, and vanilla. It skips lightly across the front of the tongue hitting in the middle with a charcoal, oak, and rye. Then the peppery heat of the rye comes through for a warm, but balanced finish."

4.0,"This is a bit different than other Booker's bourbons. The description of roasted meat and thyme are spot on. I enjoy this one while sitting outside while cooking on the green egg. This one is different in a good way. Not my every day sipper, but a fine bourbon. 90/100"

2.0,"The review is spot on. Very dry, incredibly strong. Not very complex in my opinion. I threw a cube in it."

3.0,"I'm expecting something weird, honestly, based on what I've heard. I get some herbal notes on the nose. This is definitely drier than other batches. The spice is nice, lingers on the tongue... forever. The heat is along the lines of Booker's. I think this is a fresh take. I do prefer the classic Booker""s profile, but I can appreciate this. 8/17/18"
