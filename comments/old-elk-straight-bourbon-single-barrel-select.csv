3.75,I like this. I get an unusual combination of dill and honey on the palate. This was a 5 year old Ohio release. I would buy it again.

4.0,"Nose provides molasses, cherries and a little leather. Tastes malty and molasses. Finish lingers medium with maltiness and almost a peachy note."

3.5,"Tasting:  2 oz neat in glen cairn, then 2 drops.  This is a Binny's pick, Barrel #61.

Nose (3.5): Vanilla and creamed corn.  Tells me 2 things-- going to be a little young, and looking at some high corn in the mashbill likely.  The nose is soft and inviting, just a little difficult to find.  The corn I get reminds me of corn pops.

Palate (3.75):  Vanilla is forward but more in a custard with pie crust note.  The mouthfeel is thicker.  Corn pops are on the back end.  It isn't off putting but is just a bit out of place.  Very much on the sweeter side.

Finish (3.75):  where the palate was sweet, I now have found some pepper and oakiness to it.  Was surprised at first because this hit me without warning.  The sweetness doesn't fade or give way to spice like I enjoy, but instead of jumps out at you like a ghost in the dark.

Overall:  This is my first introduction to the brand.  I love what Greg Metze has done in the past before Old Elk for mgp so I was juiced.  Given that this was a picked barrel got me even more stoked.  I can't say I was disappointed, but I can say I wasn't wowed.  The balance was off-- too much treble, not enough bass so to speak.  I think that 6 yrs may not have been enough.  Everything about it was good individually but not enough cohesively.   UPDATE ON 3/1:  I stand by my above notes but I have a comparison for those interested....suspiciously this profile is really close to Stranahan's Yellow Label Single Barrel.  I am wondering if they do not share sources."
