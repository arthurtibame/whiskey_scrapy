5.0,"For what it is it's great. Only $5 more than Wisers and Canadian Club.  I find to be nice sipping whiskey as well as a mix. In my opinion way better than 40 Creek or something like that, so much smoother. Now if you are comparing it to a single malt whole different story. In the end I would say nice and smooth for Canadian, decent price tag and for me a nice find."
