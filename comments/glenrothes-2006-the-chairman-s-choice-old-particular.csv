4.25,"Huge hit of figs and cherries, slightly bitter yet background wood note and a very long oily finish. Almost a blood orange marmalade as well.

After taking it down to approx 55%abv and 10-15 mins in the glass the fig blast simmers down to allow a more ripe juicy cherry and raisin note to come through,  almost christmas cakey.

The oakyness becomes less bitter and more palatable at 55% and im also getting fresh leather and a creamy nut, maybe like a fresh walnut mixed into butter."
