4.5,"Neat.  Sample from an already opened bottle.  The nose blasts you with it’s age and sherry influence initially.  Oak and berries gives way to tons of vanilla and baking spice.  There is a butter cream around the whole experience bringing all the notes together.  I’ve had my nose in this for 30 minutes before tasting. 

Nice thick viscosity on the tongue.  Approaches the tongue with a surprising amount of dark notes.  Dark brown sugar.  Dark almond liqueur even.  On the taste it hits you hard with the sherry.  Transitions to the vanilla and baking spices.  Legs leave you with that rum influence - vanilla and almond.  Legs last a long, delicious time.

This might be my favorite sherry finished bourbon.  Unlike other sherry influenced bourbons that seem to focus on bright notes and fruits, this one has all interesting dark elements.  Makes it unique and interesting on top of being delicious.  Still going back to the nose, it’s crazy good."
3.25,"It’s full of sherry, golden raisins, and cooked plums. The sherry-rum cask finish is a lovely partner for the high-rye bourbon that Four Gate Whiskey Company used for this expression.

The first sip offered up the expected Sherry notes mixed with a heavy dose of simple syrup but the arrival of some pretty stout barrel tannins caught me off guard. At 11 years old, the tannins were far more aggressive than I expected. Spice rum kicked in at the end of the finish preventing this one from ending on a bitter only note. Make sure you let your bottle open up a bit before pouring your taste."
