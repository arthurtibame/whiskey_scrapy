3.5,"I'm struggling with this review.

Nose - This is a bourbon bomb. Just over powering with the vanillas and caramels and bourbon barrel oak. The peat actually is taking a back seat to a degree. There's also just a huge amount of earthy elements, much less smoke, and heavy peat and more that earthy note.  Then there's a bit of alcohol on the back end as well.

Taste - Just like the nose it's bourbon, almost bourbon candy, with bitter oak and then a wave of that earthy smoke and peat. It's deep and rich throughout. There's a bit of a wet oak note in the middle that's pretty interesting and it finishes with a lot of oak and and vanilla along with the ocotmore peat profile.

The 9.3 was to me a showcase of the natural spirit and it was an incredible tributes. This is more a tribute to what I can only assume were very good bourbon barrels and a mix of sources to give it a more interesting bourbon note. It however somewhat under minds the spirit.  

3.5 but I'll come back to this one as I wonder if it will open up with time."

4.0,"Smells and tastes like the 10.1, but with added peat flavor on top of the wood. More of the earthy peat notes here rather than smoke, like the soil/grassy peat elements shine through. Coming back to it I get a tingling spice on the tail."
