3.5,Nice color and good Macallan taste but not as good as the 12 yr old Sherry aged. A little sweet as well.

3.75,A bit less smooth and rounded when compared to any of the 12 year old expressions. Still has the classic Macallan color and nose.

4.0,This was the first Macallan I tasted and pushed me in the direction of single malts. Very smooth.

3.0,"Light and floral upfront.  The first thing you notice is how sweet this whisky is, you can taste the sherry influences, but the main takeaway is sweetness.  There’s a lot of vanilla and a little dark chocolate as the flavours develop.  The medium short finish is still sweet and slightly spicy.

Overall, this is not very complex or nuanced.  It’s sweet, sherried and with a good amount of vanilla.  An easy to drink and very accessible dram."

3.5,"A NAS alternate version of the double cask expression (the other one is a 12yo); and obviously a younger Macallan that is actually a good option for only $45. 

Bottled at 40%abv

On the nose, your typical macallan; the almost cliche chocolate, dulce de leche, snickers, milky way and butterfinger, BUT the herbal notes here are almost non-existing leaving an acetone/alcohol note which is actually not un-pleasant. 

On the palate it is a little rough but mantains the toffee and nuttiness of the 12yo, but it definitively feels younger. Clove aftertaste, short. 

Overall this is a cheaper, but not so different in flavor and aroma, expression to the 12yo, it deserves at least a 76 over 100."
2.0,Decent but not worth the price.
3.75,"Nose raisins, vanilla, honey, dried fruit. Pallet raisins, vanilla"
