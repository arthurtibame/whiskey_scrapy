4.0,I love all of Smooth Ambler's line and this one does not disappoint.
3.0,"A great distillery visit and tour in West Virginia, and one of the older and more distinguished members of the craft/independent distillery movement.  The Yearling has a nice caramel heart and has already pulled in some strong oak notes from the barrels.  It stands up well to, and reminds me of, Maker's Mark.  It still shows its youth, as the name fairly indicates.  The price is high for a half-handle, but I am rooting for these guys (the rest of the line also is well worth trying)!"

4.0,Always like to find a whiskey with a unique flavor profile. This comes off as reserved between the bottling and color. Nose of slight pickle juice and taste of fennel and honey mustard. Sounds nasty but really enjoyable.
