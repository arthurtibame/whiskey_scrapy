3.0,"Very rare and discontinued, i found this cheap whisky in a coffee shop in Russia, and searched it on Master of Malt, and there it was. Bottled at 40%abv, with an old gold color. Not much happens on the nose and on the palate but mainly notes are: Nose: Salt Almonds Hazel nut Butter Butterfinger Chocolate Palate: Coffee Nutty flavor Slight chocolate Sherry finish warm not hot Medium finish. Overall is a 60/100, i dont think it is easy to find nor worth it."
