3.5,"Nose was slightly sweet, slightly Woody.
Palette: immediate heat. Followed by heat.  By the third sip, I was tasting coffee and chocolate notes with oats. Kind of a oatmeal cookie taste. Quite flavorful. I think this is about 3.5 years in the barrel. Cask strength so the flavor has impact. Well worth grabbing a bottle."
4.25,"I hade the four wheat bourbon, cask strength.  Was very smooth for the amount of alcohol.  Well balanced.  Lots of oak notes.  Definitely try!"
