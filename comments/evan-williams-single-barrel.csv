4.0,"Great price, great taste, 8 year love it"
3.75,Seems a bit harsh for a 7 year. After the initial taste and with a little time it calms down. Pretty strong vanilla and a little nutty. For a $30 whiskey it’s a great bottle.

3.5,"I get pineapple upside down cake on the nose, and a touch of passionfruit(?). I think I’d like the nose more if these scents were richer, more intense, but it’s a great entree to a light, hot weather sipper. A bit more fruit on the palate, but mostly char and spice. Medium heat. Brief finish with a little more spice and some subtle changes as a light hug grabs you on the way down."
2.5,"It’s said that the “single barrel” varies from year to year, so I write this with that caveat. However, based on this tasting (two consecutive evenings), I’m not impressed at all with this whisky. Admittedly, I did have high hopes for this bottle given its very high rating with Distiller—and usually these ratings I tend to agree with. All in all, this was a big miss for me. This whisky came across unsettled, sort of unfriendly. It was as is the flavors couldn’t sort themselves out, and nothing settled or stood out."

3.5,Neat. Get mostly spicy and woody notes at first with the usual caramel bourbon base. After a few sips I notice chocolate on the finish and a lingering banana (maybe). Good flavor but could be smoother for a low proof. This one was 8 yrs exactly.

Hard to get a nose in a restaurant but I get lots of vanilla.  Light, bright notes.  Hint of floral even.

Creamier mouth feel than expected considering the 86 proof.  Hint of brown sugar on the tongue. All vanilla and spice on the taste.  Surprisingly long legs.  Even a leaves behind a little burn.  All surprising for the proof.

This is a great, cheap go-to."

4.0,This spirit has grown on me over time. At first I considered the 96 rating laughable but the second third fourth and ... tastings caused me to conclude this is a very good bourbon. Not a 96 but a solid low 90’s. I paired it with a Montecristo No. 4 Cuban cigar tonight; a nice one two punch. The bourbon has a light pleasant nose of sweet fruitiness and vanilla oak. The taste is similar with a saltiness and lovely spice on the finish. The finish is moderately long and delightful. I plan for this offering to be a staple in my cabinet from now on.

3.75,"I tasted this as part of my Bourbon Steward certification exam. Below are my (mostly unedited) notes from that tasting:

Evan Williams Single Barrel Vintage (Barrel #677, barreled 2011-08-04, bottled 2019-04-30)
Evan Williams Single Barrel Vintage (Barrel #678, barreled 2011-08-04, bottled 2019-04-30)
Evan Williams Single Barrel Vintage from a Heaven Hill taster pack (unknown barrel, unknown barrel date, unknown bottle date)

While shopping for samples for this exam, I was in the local Wake County ABC store (Raleigh NC) where they have lighted shelves for the bourbon section, and I asked myself, ""Why is this bottle of Evan Wiliams lighter than that bottle?""

When I realized they were drawn on the same day from different barrels, I was immediately curious to see how the two bottlings would compare to each other, as well as how they would compare to the 100ml sample from a Heaven Hill taster pack I found in Chattanooga TN the week before!

Barrel 677 and 678 were barreled 2011-08-04 and bottled 2019-04-30, aged 7 years and 9 months. The taster pack sample is assumed to have been aged a similar amount of time. The label claims 86.6 proof, but I sensed some variation (see below).

On the nose: caramel, indistinct fruit, perhaps cocoa? 678 seems bolder. The taster pack sample from the unknown barrel seems blander than 678 but stronger than 677.

On the tongue: 677 has buttery feel, and tastes of caramel and toffee. 678 not as buttery, but has similar flavors and seems like it is higher proof. (A quick comparison of legs in these Glencairn whiskey tasting glasses seems to indicate less leg with 677 than 678 and the unknown barrel.) Unknown barrel seems to taste of salted peanuts, maybe? Seems the fieriest of the three. Returning to 677, it's definitely the tamest of the three.

On the eyes: Barrel 678 is visually slightly darker in color. It and the unknown barrel appear to have more leg and are definitely higher proof than 677.

On the tongue with filtered water added to each: 677 is really laid back. Now I taste the expected vanilla in addition to caramel. I can't pick out individual fruit flavors but it's generally in the background, along with salted peanuts again. 678 is definitely higher proof; with the same amount of water added, it seems to be stronger than 677 before I added water to it. It's similar for the unknown barrel, but it seems to have a proof lower than 678 but higher than 677 (I retract my earlier ""fieriest of the three"" comment). Now I'm tasting a some citrus, chiefly lemon, on the mid-tongue as I swirl 678.

Summary: As expected, although all three are labeled identically, there are differences, mostly subtle. The usual bouquet and flavors are there: caramel, vanilla and indistinct fruitiness. 677 has elusive hints of cocoa or chocolate but hard to pin down. 678 is bolder, with stronger and more-varied flavors, especially some citrus-y notes like lemon. The taster pack sample from an unknown barrel and date seems to mimic 678 much more than 677. And lastly, Barrel 678 seems to be higher proof than Barrel 677, with the unknown barrel somewhere between them (but closer in proof to 678). As I expected, this tasting shows that all three are mostly similar in taste but subtle differences exist. The obvious difference in proof was a surprise, but in hindsight I should have expected it. If I had to choose among the three the next time I bought a bottle a bottle of Evan Wiliams Single Barrel Select, I'd hope for something most like Barrel 678."

It's subtle and blended- it's like a generic tropical flavor, though not artificial.  This is easily drinkable.  My only real complaint is that I wish the whole thing was bottled at higher proof, Bottled in Bond would make this a perfect daily drink in my opinion.  Pretty pleasant and reasonably complex for the price.  It's also accessible- I feel like I could introduce someone to bourbon with this."

4.0,"When I purchased EW 1783 I decided to also buy the BiB and Single Barrel for comparison of EW ""premium"" products. I neglected to buy the standard Green or Black, but maybe in the future I'll try those again for posterity. I had them enough in college to know their pluses and minuses.

EW Single Barrel was one of the first ""nice"" whiskey purchases I made out of college. And I thought it was great, always recommended it to my friends when they were looking for an affordable bourbon that seemed classy and tasted great. I still think this is hard to beat for a name brand under $35. But now I wish the proof was between 90-100 considering the BiB is half the price. The nose is heavy with caramel and oak, much stronger than the proof suggests. However, the taste is beautiful and somewhat light. That nose continues to the taste, with more cinnamon and caramel sweetness. The finish is moderate to light, mostly oak and spices and does not linger too long. If this was 95 proof then I think the Distiller rating of 96 would be justified, but I think the rating is closer to 90 at this proof. Either way, this is a great starter bourbon that should never disappoint. But if you have graduated to higher proof bourbons, the ratings you can find for this may seem over hyped.

I am very appreciative of the transparency of EW compared to other large brands. They give you far more information than other single barrels. This bottle was barreled on 03-29-11 in barrel #274 and bottled on 01-10-19, a 7.75 year age statement. Hopefully other distilleries will provide this minimal information."

2.75,"Interesting to find an age stated bourbon (mine is just over 8 years) for under $30.  I'm skeptical about the quality given the cost versus age comparison.

Nose: Very mild flavors of vanilla, brown sugar, and a background floral scent like honeysuckle.  A little bit of cedar and peanut as well just at the end.  This sounds weird but I'm getting a little bit of pineapple.  Not particularly complex but a pleasing nose.  

Flavor: Sweeter than the nose would suggest.  Interesting that I'm not getting any of the fruity, floral, or nutty flavors that I expected from the nose.  Very one note with sweet vanilla flavors and a little bit of oak. Thinner than I'd expect at 8 years.

Finish: Very short finish with some spice and a little bit of wood.  A little drying and tannic but it didn't hang around long enough for any interesting flavors to develop.

This was an ok whiskey but not at all what I'd expect from an 8 year age stated bourbon.  Very thin and one dimensional with a short finish.  The most interesting part was the nose.  I feel like this would have benefitted significantly from a higher proof like there were more interesting flavors and scents lurking in the background that would have been brought forward by maybe 100 proof?

Good for the value under $30 but compared to other age stated whiskeys under $30 like Eagle Rare or McKenna 10 I found this lacking."

2.5,"Vanilla and oak on the nose. Tiny bit of caramel beneath, can be a bit heavy on the alcohol if you're not careful. There is a pretty noticeable apple juice lurking behind everything else. The notes have an interesting aspect of smelling like they're coming from something frozen or coming out of a freezer. It's not bad, just lends the nose a slightly watered down element while also smelling like it's super chilled. Hard to explain. The first taste is almost overwhelmingly salted peanuts in the shell. The salt and a bit of heat is hard to get past to detect anything else. The apple juice is clearly present just behind the salted peanuts with the sweet fruit taking the edge off the salt eventually. You're left with a fairly juicy note that sees some caramel creep in as the salt fades just enough to leave you picturing apple slices drizzled with salted caramel. On subsequent tastes the cycle basically repeats itself, just with slightly more oak being noticeable, particularly in the middle. The intense salty peanut quality stands up really well to coke (if you've never poured some salted peanuts into an ice cold coke and then drank it, you really should) but the price is just high enough for me to not go out of my way to get it just for mixing when it's not dynamic enough to drink neat--it just lands in a no-man's land space of price/enjoyment for me."

I recently tried a Hayes Parker bourbon and was pretty disappointed. Unfortunately, this is reminiscent of that. However I think I’m getting over it and learning to appreciate this EW Single Barrel for what it is.

The nose started off kind of Smokey whit some vanilla, and a light fruitiness and a hint of corn.
The palate is nice, it has a somewhat thicker mouthfeel. You get some sweetness on the tongue with an ever present fruitiness that lingers along with some Barrel depth. The finish is medium length that goes down easy.
I really enjoyed this one."
4.5,"According to the Internet, Evan Williams is the billionaire co-founder and former director of Twitter. Apparently, having taken leave of Silicon Valley, Williams has established himself as a world-class distiller and namesake to the Evan Williams line of bourbons. Some will tell you that this brand is named for a Welsh immigrant and distiller who is believed to have opened Kentucky's first commercial distillery in 1783, but there really is no way to know for sure. Whoever this Evan Williams guy is, his Single Barrel Vintage is regarded as one of the best quality to value ratios in all of bourbon, and as such, a necessary bottle to add to my collection.

This particular iteration of the popular label was put into barrel 833 on July 20, 2011, and bottled on June 1, 2019, just shy of its eighth birthday. As usual, my taste was poured neat. The nose is exceedingly pleasant with strong vanilla and caramel aromas dominating and a hint of cloves and light tropical fruit supporting. The sip is smooth, light, and fruity. Sweet notes of brown sugar and candied cherries on the front and spicy cinnamon towards the back make for a delightfully balanced sip. The finish is gentle and warm lasting a good while with warmth through the chest and charred oak on the tongue. It's easy to see why this label is so popular and it is sure to be the next big thing. Get it while it's abundant and inexpensive because it won't be so forever. I'll be picking up another bottle the next time I see one."

3.75,"Barreled on 5/20/11; Barrel number 792; bottled on 5/20/2019. On the nose the had an extremely intense cinnamon note which is followed by sugar and bready notes that almost come across as a cinnamon roll. There are lighter notes of oak, cherry, apple, and a faint peanut. The longer it sits in the glass the more fruity the drink becomes. On the palate, there is a thin cinnamon-honey sugar taste. Other lighter notes are subdued, but still present. The finish is short and leaves behind the cinnamon and oak. Compared to the rest of the Evan Williams line I believe this is the tastiest offering but the worst value. Even at such a low price, the other bottlings are similar and I am more likely to go back to those than this if I am looking for a cheap, dependable bourbon."

Found it almost hidden on the bottle shelf of this place. Out of curiosity I checked the dates on the bottles. Most were barreled in 2010, bottles in 2018. However, one dusty bottle showed barreled 2004, bottled 2014!!  A ten year bottle hidden amongst the eight years. I don’t know if this used to sell as a ten year, but I grabbed that bottle.

In general a well rounded, full whiskey, with a variety of flavor, fairly smooth, and nothing overwhelming. For me, I feel this is a great example of what whiskey should taste like."
5.0,I thought this whiskey was excellent for a whiskey under $50. I got it for $28 and was shocked at how smooth and balanced it was. Notes lasted longer than many in it’s class. Bar none the best whiskey under $30.
4.5,Nice surprise from this very reasonably price bourbon.  Will be buying again. (Drank neat in a rock glass after a 20 minute rest)  Barrel 871   7 years 10 month age.

Wow! This is by far the best single barrel I’ve had by Evan Williams. This one is so creamy sweet and fruity. Wow, just wow. I now know how the experts scored a 96 on this. I’ve had some bottles, particularly the last one that put me off of this but man o man this is certainly back in the lineup. 

Nose is heavy vanilla, caramel, and fig. The taste is ridiculously smooth and tastes like a vanilla bomb with subtle hints of oak. Slight, very slight, almost minuscule burn as it goes down. I don’t  think I’ve ever had anything go down this smooth even other EWSBs. Could be the 86 proof but I don’t care, I like it!! The finish doesn’t last long enough but makes you want to keep going back to remember how delicious the last sip was.

For the $22.98 I paid at ABC liquors last Friday, this is worth EVERY penny and more. Maybe I got a honey barrel but I’m gonna go back and clear the shelf on this one because it’s THAT good. 

If you can find this particular barrel with those dates (needle in a haystack I know) I highly recommend picking this one up and at $23 buy waaaay more than one.

Taste is an approachable vanilla caramel peanut brittle. Light oak and baking spice.

Finish is low/medium and mainly sweet oak and baking spice.

3.75,"I picked up a bottle on sale. Barreled in 2009, bottled in 2018. Can’t go wrong for a single barrel under $30. What I had was incredibly oaky and that muted any other tasting notes.

3.75,"Eager to try EWSB as it has great reviews. I understand this is year/batch dependent. Barreled 8/26/08, bottled 9/27/16- barrel # 408. Poured neat, good glass coat. Deep dark caramel and butterscotch nose. Dusty oak, slight nutty character and rye spice. Standard mouthfeel brings a well of sweet caramel and baking spices, some rye and oak carried by good heat. Very rich and velvety. Finishes long, caramel, cinnamon and oak lingering. I find Heaven Hill bourbons to have more barrel influence than other distillers. This is hella good, sweet and savory. Great value too at mid $20's( $26 paid). Easily worthy of a rotation spot..... 88/100 ........Is good from the get go but improves quickly once bottle is opened. Will try other vintages for sure!"

My bottle is from barrel 819, barreled 4-12-10; bottled 6-11-18. This is a fantastic bottle---sipping it neat at room temperature straight out of the shipping case...The nose is full, corn sweetness and malted barley combine with barrel char to seemingly give a slight maple/honey note. This continues on the tongue with the addition of dark red fruit (cherry?) and a pronounced sweetness---more than I usually pick up with Evan Williams. It has good legs in the glass and a silky touch on the tongue. The finish is long, slight heat at the beginning and then a lingering sweet honeyed fruitiness that is still there 2-3 minutes later. Just the ticket to induce the need for another sip. I wonder how long I can force myself to make my six bottles last."

3.75,"Following up my review of Evan Williams Black Label, I wanted to see how the Evan Williams Single Barrel would stack up against it.  Would the extra $15 per bottle, years of age, and 0.3% ABV make a difference?  Let's find out!

Mash Bill: 78% Corn, 12% Malted Barley, 10% Rye
Age: NAS (but between 7-8 years)
ABV: 43.3%
Price: $24.99 (typically $25-$32)

Nose: By comparison to the EW Black Label, the nose seems extraordinary.  Sweet, rich caramel.  Cherries, red apple, vanilla, toasty oak, and cherry blossoms.  Faint red licorice, mild spice, and pink bubblegum.  Surprisingly concentrated for only a 0.3% ABV bump over the EW Black Label - that's clearly some quality barrel time showing.  

Palate: Wow.  What a difference over the EW Black Label.  Sweet, oaky, and fruity - all well-integrated.  Rich and mouthcoating.  Toffee and dark caramel, oak char, cherries, red licorice, and spice.  Mild herbal, floral, and salty notes.  I think this bottle has even improved a bit since opening a few week ago.  

Finish: Medium length.  Dominated by sweet, dark caramel, then drying oak and char astringency with salty minerals.  Yum.

Verdict: Yep.  That extra $15, ABV, and time in the barrel makes a huge difference.  Way more going on in this dram.  I might ruffle some feathers saying this, but I think this was better than the last Four Roses Single Barrel I had.  However, it's not quite a 4-star dram for me...yet.  I wish it had just a bit more ""oomph"".  46%?  48%?  Could be lights out!  As it is, it's very good (though my bottle was apparently not to the outlier caliber of Rob Morton's of Distiller  - 96 seems a little high). In any case, this bottle offers excellent VFM with the caveat that it is a single barrel release and some variation is to be expected.  Recommended.

4.25,"Barreled in 2011, 8 years to bottle date.

Sleeper single barrel that I’ve overlooked for a while because of the price tag. Tried Evan Williams Bottled-in-Bond and loved it, thought I’d give this a whirl.

Nose: Cinnamon, oak, and absurdly high ethanol burn. Hard to push through it. 

Palate: Balanced, relatively thin palate. A bit of a spicy mouthfeel that goes down surprisingly smooth. After the first initial sips, vanilla sweetness paired with hints of oak and barrel spice made itself known. Best part of this whiskey. 

Finish: Long finish that lingers more than expected. Where I’d expect some rye notes , I got hints of barrel staves that just rest on the tongue. Not bad for a budget 8 year. 

The nose is the only thing keeping this from being an exceptional bourbon. I can see myself hoarding one or two more bottles of the 2011 before they’re gone. If you’re looking for value and complexity, or a just an intro to single barrels, grab one on your next run."

3.75,"I clearly did not get the 'honey barrel' that the distiller reviewer did, but I do enjoy the 2011 vintage I bought.  Almost 8.5 years old.  A wonderful nose of vanilla and oak.  Low rye, and drinks sweet and smooth, thanks to the solid age and low bottling proof. Tasty sweet and salty peanut brittle shines through on the front of the palate too.  A little disappointed in the mouth feel and shorter finish, which is mostly oak and brown sugar, with a little leather showing through.  

This competes well at the price point, especially because of how widely available it is. Not as complex as normal Buffalo Trace, but that is not to say I would always pick BT over this. Sometimes a little more sweet and simple is what you want, and lets not forget that BT far and away owns the $20-$25 price range.

This is a great bottle to gift to a beginner or non-connoisseur. The wax dip, neck tag, and hand marked barrel and dump dates. Reach for this as a gift instead of the usual Basil Haydens or Makers.  I would never be disappointed to receive this and I look forward to trying other vintages. Not deserving of the given 96, but deserving of a spot in your rotation and a little more respect than it gets."

It's good to have one pop out that whilst nothing special is just a nice middle of the road dram.

Nose: Deep Caramel, Vanilla, Juicy Fruit Gum, Barrel Oak, Peanuts, Dried Corn,  & Straw. This is the textbook classic bourbon nose. After some time in my Glencairn, a Vegetal note appears and begins to dominate. 
Neat: The mouthfeel is definitely on the lighter side, but I would in no way consider it thin. The palate is Oak Driven. Vanilla, Caramel, & Dubble Bubble Gum. Very Straightforward. Not complex, but what it does, it does well. A little heat on the sides of the tongue and mouth with a light Kentucky Hug. Vanilla and slightly bitter oak coat the palate. Reminds me of a watered down/muted HMcK10.
Splash: The nose and palate both pick up a Maple note. The Heaven Hill Peanut also appears on the palate along with a little more soft oak.

Verdict: Several years ago, this was the first Single Barrel product I ever purchased. Back then, the age was running around 10 years. It was without a doubt, one of the best sub-$30 bourbons around. Then as demand increased, the age of each subsequent ""vintage"" became younger and younger (if memory serves, some vintages were in the 6 year range). That was also about the time that NC ABC's decided to start carrying HMcK10. Same classic Heaven Hill mash bill. 14 proof points higher. Single Barrel as well as boasting a full 10year age statement...for less money! It became a no-brainer. Now that the McKenna has crept up to $40 and is hard to find? This is a damn fine substitute, especially now that supply is starting to catch up and the age on EWSB is starting to slowly creep back toward that magic 9-10 year sweet spot. This is once again becoming one of the better sub-$30 options on the shelf."

3.0,"Initial aroma is very light nuttiness. First sip is light vanilla and brown sugar.  The finish is almost absent entirely on this one. A small pepper burn and then gone. I know the earlier vintages were highly regarded, but this is almost like a watered down whiskey. Definitely disappointed given the high marks here on Distiller."

5.0,"For 20.99 you  can get a mellow single barrel vintage bourbon bottled at 86.6 proof. A heaven hill offering since 1983 this is truly a unique product in its price range. For me and many others the meaning small batch has basically no meaning since its definition is different for different producers. without any real definition  of what small batch is you dont always know what you're getting. However single barrel  vin trages are a completely different story, they are barrels  selected by the master distiller to be reserved for a single batch of bottles that are labeled corresponding to the barrel they came from.  This differs greatly from traditional small batch products where many barrels can be blended together. It is for this reason I so greatly enjoy this product. You never know exactly what you will be getting if you get two bottles from diffrent barrels, you just know it's going to be good. Very oily bourbon, had long fingers on the glass, incredibly smooth and complex when drank meat, slight floral notes when a few drops of water are added. Delightful neat, on the rocks or in a cocktail!"

2.0,"Classic oily texture and warmth from the corn spiraling through the bold tannins of wood. Strong alcohol on the nose, medium brown color, noticeable burn for mouthfeel, light fruit or floral essences lingering after swallow. Consumed neat and with a splash of distilled water. (Barrel 128, Racked 1-9-12, Bottled 12-12-19)."

4.25,"Sweet oaky flavors, cherry comes out in the nose and palate as well as candied apple. Full rich flavors. Has a baking spice on the finish sometimes. Very pleasant, not sickly sweet like other bourbon can be."
4.25,"Sweet and fruity on the nose; Raisins, banana and tangerine with underlying cereal notes.
Generally sweet oh the palette, with a thick/rich rummy mouthfeel, but with those oak and vanilla notes to remind us that this is still bourbon after all. Very enjoyable."

4.25,This is good bourbon that most liquor stores carry. Although some stores get them and sell them fast. Due to the smoothness of the Whiskey. I enjoy drinking this neat and on some occasions on the rocks. Easily my favorite Whiskey under $30.
1.5,"I just finished a 2011 bottle, barrel #499, bottled 3-15-19. It was one of the blandest bourbons I’ve ever had, almost as if it had been stored in a used barrel. Disappointed in this one."

4.75,"Fruit and spice in the nose, on entry and slowly fading away in the finish. This is too good to continue typing; I'm simply going to enjoy this dram."
3.75,"Evan Williams is one of my core selections. I think it's just a great bourbon and EWBiB is a spectacularly good deal.  But the Single Barrel has been in my rotation for years and the BiB is more or less an impulse buy.  Why?  EWSB has just proven itself to be a dependable, tasty bottle that's always got that 'single barrel' gamble coming along for the ride.  Sometimes its spectacular, other times its mearly good.

This bottle is one of the good ones.  Running with the pack, so to say.  Tasted neat from a glencairn.  The pour is copper with notable sheeting and thick tears. The nose is sweet and inviting with notes of caramel, rye, leather and sweet corn.

I love the way this bourbon has a technicolor profile.  Werther's Original gives way to traces of sasprilla, oaky barrel wood, slight char and a creamy syrup note.  This is a fun dram as it has a bit going on, but not so much that its  overwhelming. At 86.6 proof, EWSB is emminently approachable and is one of the few my wife will sip at neat.  It goes down easy.  Its sweet and above all, balanced.  

The finish is short but clean.  There's very little heat, as one might guess from the proof.  Heaven Hill really has the whole EW family dialed in, and this is the pinnacle of the line. It's a full step in front of the competition plus a quarter point for value."

3.0,"Golden color. Medium legs. Nose is maple syrup, brown sugar, baking spices, cinnamon and apple. Smells like desert with some spices thrown in. 

Palate confirms nose with slight chocolate. Mouthfeel is pleasant and round but slightly waxy and thin. Decent bourbon but I prefer higher proof. Definitely a good $30 daily sipper. 

I use the rating scale below. Distiller uses a scale of 5 and I use a scale of 10, but I’m sure you’re not too drunk to do the math! 

1. Disgusting - So bad I poured it out.
2. Poor - I wouldn't consume by choice.
3. Bad - Multiple flaws.
4. Below average - Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.
5. Good - Just average.
6. Very Good - Better than average.
7. Great - Well above average.
8. Excellent - In a league of its own.
9. Incredible - An all-time favorite.
10. Perfect"

4.5,"(neat, rock)
Nose: caramel, vanilla, brown sugar, light fruity (plum, pear) and woody (oak) notes
Taste: starts with oak and some plum, pear notes, hints of caramel and brown sugar sweetness, light and smooth
Finish: lingering oak and brown sugar sweetness, finishing with pear that stays with you for awhile 
Overall: this is a great, well-balanced bourbon with a good blend of sweetness, oak, and fruit notes.  The proof felt like it could have been increased with a fuller flavor profile but how it is makes for a great go-to sipper"
