4.5,Solid lagavulin. Tasty.
4.75,"A wonderful, interesting whisky, not for everyone, specially made for experienced whisky lovers. The notes are so bold that it won't find an easy review anywhere. 

Bottled 43%abv, with a polished mahogany color.

On the nose it is strong, powerful, savage and overwhelming. Peat, cooked ham, water balloons (really), olives, balsamic oil, and phenol notes everywhere. Fantastic.

On the palate, starts with a bubblegum note, to change into oranges, citric, spicy but very pleasant, thick, with a long beautiful spicy mouth watering finish, with ashes and bonfire notes.

Overall this is a 96 over a 100, absolutely recommended. Slaintè"
