2.0,"The age of this is probably the first thing I noticed, definitely tasted young. The flavor profile was more like a Speyside or Highland scotch, that’s the only way I can describe it. Overall, drinkable but nothing I would go back to. I live in Maine, we should just stick to our lobster!"

1.75,"My neighbor who frequents Maine provided me with a sample of this single malt.  Some details:  
Batch: 10
Bottle: 149
Aged: 2 years 3 months
Abv: 45%

What the labels specifies is that they craft their spirit “with an American twist; American cherry wood smoked barley.  This smoky spirit is aged in small oak barrels that previously held American bourbon. Surrounded by the salty sea air of Portland’s Old Port, this whiskey is American through and through.”  Sounds enticing, almost Islay-like (or Skye).  But the youthfulness will be the weakness.  Always fun to try something unique, close to home and a part of Americana. 

A slight maritime brine with stone fruit sweetness is an immediate introduction.  Some time opens a medicinal, sterile quality comes through along with some black licorice.  Longer still, apricots seeps through along with bananas with some butterscotch sweetness. 

A lightweight, watery feel on entry brings a glimpse of sweetness that flashes spicy and tingly.   That’s all feel, but the flavors are sparse and evasive.  A very earthy and mineral flavor are primary.  In no particular order: cinnamon, pickled ginger, oak char, caramel, leather. 

At the end of it all leaves the palate oaky, dry and a small amount of caramel sweetness; all but for a glimpse. 

The age, or lack thereof, is the inhibitor.  There was not enough time in the box to pull any true flavor from the cask as well as begin to form any real identity.  Maybe, as well, weak cask aren’t able to push any flavor into the distillate.  This holds the beginnings of something positive, but as it stands, is incohesive, youthful, and short on flavors.  [80/100][Tasted: 11/1/19]"
