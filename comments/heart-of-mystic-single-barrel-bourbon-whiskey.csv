3.5,"This (barrel 13, bottle 70, ABV 57.7%) is mottled mint and butterscotch with wood and nut notes straight off. I had another bottle last year I remember being much better after breathing. Will revisit this one."
1.25,"A shooter. Not for sipping. Low on flavor, big on alcohol with a lot of burn."

Barrel 18, bottle 80, 56.3 abv.  An interesting bourbon.  Not complex in terms of range of flavors, but the flavors most forward are not usually found in bourbons.  Not bad for the presumably 2-4 year age.  Wish they were more open about where this was coming from.  I assume they distill it, but the label days ""bottled by"", so idk."

2.25,I enjoyed my first bottle so much that I bought a second. It’s from a different barrel though and not nearly as tasty.
