3.0,"I have the peated finish version which I got for about $33. This is a solid blast of smoke. Poured neat, yeah its got the embers we are looking for, along with a bit of peat, sweet malt and barrel. Palate has lotsa bbq smoke with a bit of malt and some fringe sweetness. This isn't complex like the big guy Islays. Finish is long smoke and peat with fading malt sweetness and drying wood. Kind of a one trick smoky pony, but that's a good trick in my book. Lacking in depth and richness of say an Ardbeg or Lap 10 but its 33 bucks. I like it more than Ardmore for lower cost smokebomb but not a replacement for the real deal from Islay. Still good value and bbq goodness so 81/100......makes a great smoke&coke"

Comments:
With a drop of water (not much help) and a few minutes it starts off well but just falls out in the finish. It’s priced accordingly for its lazy finish. You pay for what you get.
Good starter whiskey and a nice example of young oak flavour."
3.0,Light toasted hay with a touch of toffee and a hint of dried fruit. An easy drinker for somebody starting out.

2.0,"Nice looking bottle, colour of whisky seems lighter once poured out of the bottle. On the nose, it has a strong, but pleasant, medicinal note with light toffee apple tones. First sip gives a burn but not overpowering, making it good for winter. I could definately taste the wood with the bourbon oak becoming stronger and stronger as more sips are taken. The finish is extremely short and lack of flavours becomes apparent as it begins to feel watery on the palate. Adding water didnt seem to change the whiskey profile too much"
