2.5,Peach on the nose and palate. Short finish.  It is a smooth scotch but there isn’t the complexity I expected from an 18.
3.75,"Thick with prunes and raisins on the nose, there's some butter and apricot too, creamy and viscous on the palate with butter, oak and some indeterminant spices, the finish is long and pleasant with oak tannins, butter and a hint of the stone fruits."
