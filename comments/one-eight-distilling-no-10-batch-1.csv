5.0,"I wish to correct the entry for Untitled 10 Whiskey.  It is sourced (Seagram's) High-Rye Bourbon finished in Cognac & Brandy barrels & then finished a second time in District Made Straight Rye barrels.  Batch 1 is sold out, Batch 2 has limited availability only at the Distillery.  This won Best in Class, Double Gold at the 2018 San Francisco World Spirits Competition."
