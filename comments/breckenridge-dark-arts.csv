2.5,"Taste as if scotch rolled down a strippers back past her anus, and at that point is where your mouth is waiting for this elixir. You’d be better off just sticking your tongue in the strippers butt, as far as it allows."
4.0,"Unique in a spirit crafted in the Scottish single malt style made entirely at one US distillery. This is smooth and warm in a very elegant sipping spirit, with ample milk chocolate notes. That's where I cannot decide, it is delicious, but at this price point smooth semi-sweet chocolate and low complexity is not what I look for.  That said, a bottle drinks so smooth that it doesn't last, a dram of this demands another."
