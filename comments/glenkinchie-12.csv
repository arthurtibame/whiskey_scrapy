4.0,"Nostalgic after-the-rain scent of a field of tall grass and mixed flowers in southern Indiana (a feeling locked in to memories of my childhood) — sweetness of hay, quite malty, and very floral; hints of vanilla and tropical fruit (dominated by lemon) on the palate, with a subdued but bountifully spicy maltiness; tea-like bitterness in the mouthfeel with a deep burn; definitely light in body but woody enough, the finish is lengthy and peppery; aftertaste is of dry prairie grass and has a malty depth; mundane but elegant, this reminds me of Deanston Virgin Oak but with far more assertiveness and surety. A pleasure to share this dram with my dear friend Kory in celebration of his marriage!"

3.5,"Lowland whiskies tend to be overlooked by many whisky drinkers. That's a shame! Being a rather light, soft and floral Single Malt, Glenkinchie 12 has a surprising complexity. The nose is mildly grainy and fruity with honey, nuts and caramel. It's a busy nose that needs a bit of time to open up. On the palate, the dram arrives full-bodied with ripe fruits, pepper and a malty spiciness. It turns slightly dry and there is an occasional spiritiness coming through. The finish is fresh and aromatic but rather short. An easily accessible malt with a remarkable character!

2.0,"Another sample from Flaviar.  I had this one last night right after sampling the Talisker Port Ruige, while catching up on DVR recordings of Silicon Valley after a week of a business trip.  Mistake #1:  I had this after a Talisker.  It couldn't even tell if I was having plain water or a Glenkinchie.  mistake #2:  I read the label where it came from:  sample was sent from Ljubjana, Slovenia.  I started to reminesce about how beautiful Slovenia was---cute little capital, gorgeous fairy tale castle in Lake Bled, and amazing food (close to Italian border).  And then of course, if you go, you simply have to drive over to Croatia, especially Dubrovnik!! Even more amazing food, lovely beaches, beautiful architecture, and King's Landing!! Ok--back to business--- I don't think I can write much fairly for this sample.  Was totally fleeting.  A bit of honey, not much in the nose, and can't even rember the finish.   But, I do really miss Ljubjana.  I should go again one day."

3.0,"I decided to put a little work in tonight on the scotch tour by banging out 3 samples in somewhat rapid succession:  anCnoc Flaughter, Aultmore 18 and this Glenkinchie 12 year old.  Paul seems to be running away with this round of samples and I gotta catch up.

The Glenkinchie is a lowland distillery located just outside of Scotland’s capital city of Edinburgh.  This 12 year old single malt has recently just replaced the 10 year in their core offering group.  It’s golden yellow in color and comes in at 43% ABV.  I believe there’s no coloring added and it’s also NCF’d.

The nose is kinda bourbon-esque:  barley, honey, vanilla and fresh cut oak are the dominant odors, with just a hint of roasted almonds coming through as well.  The flavor on the tongue doesn’t veer too far from the nose, while maybe adding some stone fruit notes, with even more oak.  The finish is welcoming, though, with some cereal notes and warm chocolate rounding it out.

This Glenkinchie and the above mentioned Aultmore are quite similar and play well together, with the unexpected harshness of the Aultmore keeping its  score down even though it has 6 more years in the cask.  Neither whisky are gold star examples for their regions, but this 12 year old gets a bump simply because of price point (which I believe is around $45-50).  A big thanks and a hearty welcome to Telex for supplying this malt.  Welcome to the team.  3.5 stars.  Cheers."

3.0,"This whisky is  bottled at 43% ABV and is a light gold in the glass. It produces average legs when given a spin. 

The nose on this dram is pleasant, light, and bright with strong floral notes and some lemon zest. Water brings out some darker tones, some dark fruit notes and a hint of smoke.

The palate is fairly sweet with honey, grass, and more floral notes. Not my favorite flavor profile but not bad...

The finish is short, slightly smoky and dry. Online price for this whisky is $58, at least for a retailer that will deliver to my area. Not a bad dram, but not one I will be looking to buy. 3.75/5 overall. Cheers!"

2.5,"Bourbon is my drink of choice, and while this is not my first experience with Scotch, this is my first time attempting to review a Scotch. I received a Scotch taster box with 3 samples, and the Lowland single malt Glenkinchie 12 Year is what I am starting with. I don't know what the typical notes are in a Scotch, or if there are even ""typical"" notes, so I'll do my best to give an honest and accurate review. If you're a Scotch virgin like me, this review may be just what you're looking for.

The nose is bright and light with honey sweetness, slight fruit, cereal, and some underlying smokiness. There is something about the nose that reminds me of white wine, but I'm not a wine guy so who knows what that means? The mouthfeel is smooth and oily with a palate that is sweet, light, and fruity. There are not a lot of standout flavors so describing this whisky in anything but general terms is difficult. The finish is moderate with an earthy smoke and apple followed by a bit of mint. I suspect that this is a good introductory Scotch and is easy to drink. There was nothing in here that scares me away from Scotch, but also nothing to bring me back. Scotch cocktails are not something I am familiar with, but I would imagine this would be a good one to use in a cocktail. It's fine."

4.0,"It’s been a while since I tried a Lowland single malt (not that there are that many to choose from, and I don’t have the $$$ to shell out for Rosebank). This is one of the single malts from the Diageo tasting kit my wife bought me, and goes with my previous reviews of Caol Ila, Cardhu, and Clynelish. 

After some time resting in the glass, the nose reveals honey, fresh cut grass, toasty malt notes, and I get a hint of pineapple. Lovely!

Palate is all creamy malt and golden honey. It reminds me of a more rounded, slightly sweeter version of the Deanston 12 or and Irish blend. The finish is relatively short bit there just the slightest nip at the end to remind you of the lovely experience you just had. 

This malt was lovely (did I mention it was lovely...). I may go so far as to even track down a bottle. Sometimes you just need something that’s easy to sip on that rewards you for minimal effort. This is that malt. Cheers!"

Nose: Sulphur, rubbery

Color: very light for scotch, yellow gold.

Finish: Inviting to drink again but not a long finish.  Lacks in the finish, but generally pleasant.

3.0,"On the nose, I am getting a mix of apples, oranges, heather, and grandma’s sweet tea.  For the palate, I get a bright splash of subtle banana, pineapple, vanilla, and light fruit. A very light mouth coat, and two finishes. One is a short, almost bitter finish, and the other wave is buttery oil, which was fairly long. This makes me think of “Double Vision” by Foreigner. I will say that even though this is far from my wheelhouse, it’s a pleasant dram. 3.25."
4.0,"Stop number 46 on the SDT is Glenkinchie. Only my second of the Lowland distilleries, this 12 year old is one of Diageo's Classic Malts of Scotland. Bottled at 43% ABV, chill filtered and has colorant added making it a yellow gold. 

The nose has a ton of honey and orchard fruits. Oranges, lemons, pears and baked apples. A little toffee and butterscotch and a nice warm vanilla. Very light oak and a bit of a floral note. Buttery biscuits and a touch salty. Really quite enjoyable in its light and fruity nature. Not super complex, but good. 

A very light arrival on the palate, but the development has a burst of flavors. Some underripe fruits like apples, pears and grapes. Lots of honey and vanilla. Slightly sour, but good. A bit nutty, like pecans or perhaps walnuts. It's also a little savory with buttered biscuits and tea. 

A fairly light bodied mouthfeel, creamy and rich. 
A medium long finish that is slightly bitter oak and honey. Dry. 

I have to say I was not expecting anything here after trying Auchentoshan earlier in the tour. This Lowland has Speyside levels of flavor and a profile that isn't so different from its northerly neighbors. The nose is a little on the tame side, but the palate makes up for it before it's somewhat bitter finish. At around $50 it's a decent price but not great. A good summertime dram. I could also see having this with a mild meal. A touch of sherry maturation would have really made this a great dram. As is I give it a 3.75. Thanks to Telex for the sample. 
Cheers"

1.75,"Nose: Initial honeyed tones followed closely by earthy, farmyard aromas and wildflowers (calliopsis). A slightly sour fermented-hay note and cooking oil in the background. There is a nutty ale-like aroma as well. There's a lot going on here but it takes a while to open.

Palate: The arrival is faintly spicy together with herbal honey - rather like spiced mead - and it has a tannic, woody character that expands in the development. Sour/bitter malt with a metallic astringincy reminiscent of quince or unripe persimmon. The texture is both lightly oily and slightly gripping.

Finish: Medium. The flinty fruitiness of the palate fades into an unusual herbal flavour that is what I would imagine chewing dandelions would taste like.

An unusual malt that I disliked at first, then eventually came to appreciate, but never really enjoyed. It is a confused and confusing dram.

The nose is basically floral in character but not in any manner that is typically encountered. It's not honeyed nor freshly floral, not light nor heavy. It's more acrid herbal, like the aroma of crushed daisies and there is an agricultural quality. I hesitate to use the word ""funk"" as it has become so deplorably overused in the last year or so that it has become a cliché, but yes - there is a sense of that here. The palate was inferior to the nose, being sharper and lacking heft. It's not what I'd call a balanced malt.

Adding water did nothing for the nose - it muted what character was there into insignificance. I thought it did improve the palate, however, by plastering over the less agreeable notes.

This was a hard one to rate. It does have individuality and character but while it is not actually flawed I didn't think it was very pleasant. I tasted it from a 30ml commercial sample and I'm thankful I don't have to regret having bought a whole bottle.

When I was last in Edinburgh I had an opportunity to visit the distillery but did not do so. I went to the Scottish National Gallery with Mrs Cascode instead. It was the right choice.

4.0,"My first Lowland Whisky. I had a mini bottle of it, the worst looking mini bottle i have, i had no expectation for it and it suprised me. 

Bottled at 43% abv, pale gold color. 

On the nose is rather good, there is an alcohol note that can't be avoided but doesn't change the fact that it smells good. Perfumed notes of Vanilla and prunes can be found in a pleasant way.

On the palate is also nice, with a pleasant tobacco, oak and black pepper. A little hot, but nice. medium bodied, has also a medium finish with spices.

Listen to me, add two drops of water to this baby. It is rare when water makes a whisky better, this is one of those cases.

After Water i got: On the nose, Toffee and spices that makes your nose tickle. On the Palate: More hotness BUT THICK. it changed into a full bodied experience with bitter chocolate but thick and very mellowed. Finish became  better, with tobacco notes. 

Recommended Dram!"
