3.0,Smooth but a little watered down
2.0,"Nose: Sugar, molasses and a huge floral punch

Mouthfeel: A little thin but coats nicely

Taste: Like shoving your face in a bouquet, the sweetness almost totally vanishes in lieu of a huge floral flavor.

Finish: Sugary sweetness shows up a little bit, with a little vanilla.

Overall: Not bad, not sure it's worth the $20/350ml price but I'm always willing to give something local a shot every now and again; I'm not overly disappointed. I'm giving this a Rank 4. It's not amazingly complex, or delicious. It's just kind of there. A thin, sweet floral dram with no real complexity."
