3.75,"An easy starter. Easy, sweet, malty, sherry. I don't mind it is young, it is really good. It works. Sweet, candy, honey, tiny bit of chocolate bitterness in the short finish. Very decent. I like it."
2.75,"Nice nose that seems sweeter when compared to its taste in which the sherry influence is less felt. Hints of vanilla, light and no alcohol burn. Very short after taste"
0.25,I like lots of cheap whiskies... This is a perfect example of cheap whisky NOT worth even trying. Yuck!
1.0,"Strong taste, harsh finish even after adding water.  Pass unless it's bought for you."
