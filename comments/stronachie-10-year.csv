3.5,"Sweet toffee and butter on the nose. Initially sweet on the palate with a spicy ending on to a short, very smooth finish. A nice, light Scotch with no smoke."

3.25,"Reminds me of Balvenie 12 on the nose--balanced fruit, sweetness, and spice. Medium to light body with tart apples. Finish is short with some burn. Starts better than it finishes, but not bad."
