4.5,"The color is a glowing, dark amber, wonderfully coating the glass with each swirl with an endless amount of thin, heavy legs. The nose is oaky and at the same time full of ripe fruit. A creamy blend of vanilla custard, caramel and brown sugar follow while baking spices give a nice spicy finish to the nose, along with a certain hint of saltiness. The palate is chewy, slightly dry and oaky, with pleasantly strong baking spices coming through, along with vanilla custard, caramel, brown sugar and a touch of pepper. The finish is medium long with oak and sweet vanilla custard coming together to lingering as baking spices keep the mouth warm, while the palate fades if just a bit too soon."
