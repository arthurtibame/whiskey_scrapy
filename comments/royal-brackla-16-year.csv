3.0,"Orchard fruit, light smoke and some floral notes on the nose, followed by honey and citrus on the palate. Short and slightly bitter malt finish. Not bad, but not great."

3.0,"As strange a whisky as I have ever come across. I can't get myself to either like it or dislike it: there's a malty quality I really enjoy here, like drinking beer, but I question their choice of casks - I can't get past this hint of rotting wood. Teasing out the flavors more, there are additional notes of apples and walnuts that I don't find play nice. And while the finish is pleasant and reminiscent of drinking a really delicious white ale, the road to get there was too bizarre."
null,Very nice. Fruity with a hint of smoke.

3.5,"Royal Brackla is one of those distilleries that are unable to impress me. Not bad whiskies at all, but all too boring. This expression, as the 21yo lacks of fun and i would not buy them. 

Bottled at 40%abv

On the nose Orange jam, Oranges bathed in chocolate, Caramel and Orange candy. Not bad.

On the palate, Artificial flavors, Spicy ""crazy dips"", Excess of oak and a Cloying sensation without been too sweet.
Finish has a chocolate note, very short.

Overall i give this dram a fair 74 over 100."

4.5,"Amazing, moderate sweet, super smooth, very light burn (almost none), very light smoke (maybe none). 

Not as good as balvenie 21, but close. B21 has more burn."
