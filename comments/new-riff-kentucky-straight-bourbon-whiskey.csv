The palate follows suit - a nice spice kick that lingers all the way, clove honey, light wood, salt, stewed orchard fruit, cinnamon, and bitter chocolate at the end. Tastes a bit like autumn. Let me join the chorus of people saying that this portends good things to come for New Riff. 9/12/18"

4.0,Great bourbon for the price. Was lucky enough to visit the distillery when I was in nearby Cincinnati and this was released shortly after. Had a friend send me a bottle to California. My only regret is the lack of availability in my area. For a 4 year bourbon it is bursting with flavor and has a very nice finish. Well done for their first release.

3.75,"A 4 year old high rye straight bourbon distilled Spring 2015 and bottled Spring 2019.  The mashbill is 65% corn, 30% rye, and 5% malted barley.  Non-chill filtered.  New Riff is not available in my home State of Michigan currently, but it is in Indiana as of April.  I find myself in Indiana somewhat frequently for family and such.

N:  Vanilla, caramel, peppermint, nutmeg, cloves, seasoned oak, cinnamon.

P:  Caramel, vanilla, peppermint, cinnamon, light absinthe, baked pecans.

F:  Hints of ginger, dark chocolate, licorice, peppermint, allspice with a nice oily coat.

New Riff is a fairly new distillery in Newport Kentucky (just south of Cincinnati over the Ohio River).  The high rye and relatively low age makes the rye notes very noticeable. 

I really enjoyed this.  I definitely would purchase another bottle.  Folks that done care for much spice, are probably better off leaving this alone.  

At $40 (although I think I may have paid $35 for it as I believe it was part of a weekly sale when I bough it), it is more expensive than most 4 year olds, but it’s definitely better than most 4 year olds as well."

4.0,"I hadn't heard of New Riff until this year and then, all of a sudden, it was everywhere.  Dedicated bourbon fan groups were making sojourns to this northern Kentucky-Cincinnati area distillery to do single barrel picks.  These guys have not been around for long and finally reached the critical 4-year age point where they could start releasing their product as a bottled-in-bond bottle.  To their tremendous credit, they waited that long to do it and insisted on their basic release being bottled-in-bond.  It really pays off.  If this is what a 4-year old New Riff tastes like . . . these guys are the Kilchoman of the American whiskey world.  There's nothing unusual about it yet, but it's just really good bourbon, with all of the expected caramel, heavy hitting vanilla, and mellow spice that one would expect from their high-rye mash bill.  I'm already a fan and looking forward with tremendous excitement to what this distillery can accomplish in the next decade."

I'm actually surprised the mash bill is as much corn as it is... I get a lot of the signature rye notes... cinnamon, peppery spices... I would have expected that the barley content was approaching double digits, though. I get a lot of barley notes from it, unsweet toffee and nutty... reminiscent of a Scotch, but without the peat, of course."

3.75,"This seemed to be a long week.  But it was a typical by ordinary measures.  It just to take longer to get through.  But here I am pouring the New Riff. Graciously presented to me by @PBMichiganWolverine This was distilled in fall of 2014 and bottled in the fall of 2018.  Bottled at 50% with a blend of 65% corn, 35% rye and 5% malted barley.  A high rye bourbon with some punch is a perfect pour tonight. 

Amber-copper in color. 

A light and sweet vanilla nose greets you.  The rye side is quite apparent providing a bit of spice. Cinnamon and nutmeg along with worn leather rubbed with dill and coriander.  In due time, as the alcohol dissipates, caramel, toffee and cherries interplay with the spice. 

The initial sip paves the way, slightly numbing the palate.  Once acclimated, glazed pecans with caramel and vanilla are delivered in a medium body.  The black pepper, cinnamon with a dash of nutmeg come through, tingle and keeps the sweetness in check.  A good interplay and balance at work. 

The finish retains that spice and sweet interplay.  Toffee, dark chocolate, licorice, brown sugar, cinnamon, spearmint all remain for a fair length.  Drying oak brings the palate to the ultimate finish and remains dry for quite a spell. 

Water thins the body and seems to do little else.  The sweetness and spice seems to remain unchanged and unaffected. 

A nice bourbon with a good play of sweet and spice.  The high proof is unnoticeable and this is an easy sipper.  This is a whiskey that grows in complexity over the stages.  The finish is more complex then then palate which is more complex than the nose.  A nice easy drinker that comes through older than it truly is and sips quite easily.  Thanks @PBMichiganWolverine again, for the “generous” sample.  [88/100][Tasted: 6/8/19]"

A home run for a new-ish distillery.  A bit of a tough sell at $40 and lacking some complexity, but I’d never turn it down.  Totally balanced sweet and spice, and enough backbone to drink it however you like."

Its the only sipper I had in my hotel room for the week so I had some time to get acquainted.   I was not expecting much from a micro distillery who elected to start their business by putting out a bottled in bond product instead of with a good blend of sourced juice. Boy was I wrong.  The Folks @ New Riff have started out of the gates on the correct path.  Instead of a young subpar product with a gimmick built on touring a distillery, these folks have produced a quality bottled in bond product.  It has enough spice to keep the dram interesting.  It has enough depth and complexity to stand on its own while at a price point where you don't mind mixing.  I found it a better rocks pour than a neat drink.  If you can locate some online its worth $37 to try.  I brought a few home to gift my friends.  I can't wait to try the Single Barrel and Rye they also have available.  Great Job New Riff!"

The palate has nice complexity. You get some really nice oakiness and light leather, mild sweetness and vanilla. It does dry the tongue a little bit.

The finish is medium in length, though I get some tingly lingerings to remind me of what I just had.

This is very solid bourbon. There’s a little disconnect between the nose and the palate. Though both are great, they just don’t seem like the same whiskey."

3.75,Sweet. Not as subtle as some more refined bourbon. Very good though!
3.5,"Pretty good. A little alcohol forward but it is 100 proof. Lots of spice and some oak. Not too sweet.

Not at the top of my list but I’ll keep a bottle for when I’m in the mood for a spicy 100 proof."

3.75,It’s great for only 4 yes. Something almost minty going on among all the traditional bourbon flavors. It’s not complex but interesting

4.0,Smooth for a 100 proof whiskey. Well balanced between sweet and spicy. Some vanilla but not too much. Maybe leather?  Slight vegetal notes at the end. I’d drink again definitely.
4.25,"Leather and oak on the nose. Hi rye. Bright and vibrant flavor. A bit buttery with hints of honey, caramel and vanilla. No burn for 100 proof. Flavor lasts longer than expected though. A splash of water adds a floral note but it’s better neat. A great entry at only 4 years."

4.25,Mmmm. The nose on this smells like fresh cinnamon bread. Heavy caramel and brown sugar with vanilla icing on the tongue with a smooth lasting cinnamon burn. Another strong entry from New Riff.

3.25,"Very sweet nose. Mouthful of spice, oak, and some vanilla. It’s good but was expecting more from the hype. Good pour, better with some drops of water or ice cub. Wouldn’t search or go out of my way for it though, but good"

3.0,"Resembles the tasting notes of Blantons for sure.  This one, due to its complexity welcomes a few drops of water or resting over ice to help break out the beautiful flavors."

4.25,"So, right off the bat, you can tell that the rye content is pretty insane, which it is at 35%.  This is a pretty classic style, but not one to which I'm regularly exposed.  The spiciness is quite nice and the flavor integration between sweetness, vanilla, and spice is pretty approachable, thought-provoking, and delicious.  Now, I've had the bigger brother (New Riff Single Barrel (bottled at cask strength)) and I think this is actually more enjoyable to drink.  I often love what cask strength does for a whiskey, but in this case it actually takes it over the edge for me.  This makes this Bottled in Bond a great sipping bourbon that is well-rounded and easy to drink.  My only real issue with this bourbon is the price.  This particular one was gifted to me, but it is generally sold for about $40.  For me, that's too much for a standard bourbon expression.  Therefore, I will put this in the same category as Belle Meade bourbon which is, ""everyone must buy it because it is good and worth having...once.""  If this was at the $30 mark, I would buy it time and time again.  This is just my opinion, but you can get bourbon that's just as good for 25-35$.  But, please, seek this bourbon out and try it because it is extremely respectable and worth having."

With a good warmth and slight alcohol rasp."
3.5,"Pulled the smell of leather and vanilla on the nose after resting for about 5 minutes on an ice cube. Not as peppery as others, much more sweet smelling. Being a 100 proof definitely has more alcohol taste on the palate but no burn going down. After taste pulled out the oak flavor and a bit of spice on the tongue that lingers a bit."
