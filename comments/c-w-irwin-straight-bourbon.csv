4.0,"I discovered this bourbon while on a motorcycle trip through Bend.  We stumbled across Oregon Spirit Distellers and took a tour and sampled it.  C.W. Irwin is so smooth and flavorful.  It has become my favorite bourbon, although it is hard to find here in Washington.  Would have been five stars if more readily available in Washington"
