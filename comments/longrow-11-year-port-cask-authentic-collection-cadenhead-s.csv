4.0,"Oh I really like this one...it’s dirty pretty. 

Thanks to @Richard-ModernDrinking for the sample.  It’s Friday night, which means I’m rummaging through my samples, wondering what to have for my weekly pour.  This one falls out of my hand , lands hard on the floor, and the cap breaks.  Who am I to argue with Dionysus when he has so judiciously pointed me in the right direction?

I’m a huge Talisker and Springbank fanboy, so therefore, that fandom naturally extends to its siblings.  Give this some air to breathe, a bit of water, and you’re greeted with an amazing nose.  Nose is all cherry vanilla ice cream.  Taste unfortunately is a step or two down from the aroma: almost gritty fruity.  Lingering heat in the finish.  

If you’re a fan of Springbank, this is right up your alley.  Thanks Richard for the pour!"
