5.0,A dark chocolate cherry note at the middle/end. Along with a hint of honey and other great flavors definitely recommend.
3.0,"Warm strawberry oatmeal and cinnamon shavings. Still a little young/green, but this will be a strong up and comer."

4.0,Not overpowering on the nose as well as an almost naturally  sweet finish that comes across with a slight sherry finish. Definitley not overpowering like other sherry cask finished whiskies. Would absolutely recommend if you can find.

5.0,This is great
4.0,Very smooth and pleasant.  Pairs nicely with ice and the end of a long day.
4.25,Well balanced. Pleasant weight and flavor. The Sherry cask gives a sweet lingering flavor.
4.25,Very festive. Not quite as good as the Breckinridge Sherry Cask

4.25,Sherry orange extremely smooth tastes of eh Taylor single barrel and  blantons with that top of mouth oil and finish. Very good.

4.25,"Outstanding given its young age.  Sweet nose with a powerful sherry note, and surprisingly smooth given the young age.  Tastes like a cross between amontillado and a wheaten bourbon like Buffalo Trace.  Maybe not the most complex flavor but definitely worth a try if you like both bourbon and sherry."

3.75,"This is okay.  I think it is overpriced.  Considering this is finished in PX barrels, I am not sure what I was expecting.  There is a slightly sweet, grape Cognac like smell and taste to this, but then it almost finished like a sour fruit medicine.  So might really like this, but I’d rather have a straight bourbon or a bottle of PX.  It doesn’t work for my palette."

3.5,"Started neat then added ice halfway.
Nose: immediately floral. Grassy like a bale of hay.
Palate: quite complex and fun to decipher. Getting blackberry jam, red wine reduction, and toasted spice.
Finish: long and lasting with the grassy/hay profile. Subtle spice comes back as the ice melts.
Overall entertaining with it’s complexity and deep intertwined flavors."

4.0,"This is in the sherry-finish division of my finished bourbon bracket. It was Rabbit Hole vs Wild Turkey Revival, winner to go against Joseph Magnus. In a blind taste test, Wild Turkey Revival won. As always... this is for science.

This one was a lot closer than I thought. WT comes in around $140, and Rabbit Hole around $70. I’d love to say this bourbon was half the bourbon of WT, but that’s simply not true. WT basically ticked more boxes and was a smidge more complex. As for this guy...

Nose smells of sugar and butter. Body has a genuinely good flavor. I get watermelon, cherries, and the same butter from the nose. The finish is a bit of a let down for me, taking a very bitter turn away from the body, trailing off with walnuts and raw wood.

This bourbon is really interesting. Compared to WT it packs a value for the dollars. Compared to other finished bourbons (port finished, for instance), not so much. Am I to believe that finishing in sherry barrels costs 50% more than port? Rabbit Hole, I can tell you’re young boo. Overall, very tasty, I’m a fan, not my favorite, and I’ll probably buy another one at some point. Fair?

Edit: WT Revival won out for the Sherry bracket, beating Joseph Magnus."
