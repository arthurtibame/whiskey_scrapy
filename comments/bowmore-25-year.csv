5.0,"One exquisite Islay scotch.  So fruity with a nice, smoky peat that melts across the tongue.  The finish seems much more refined than any other Bowmore I've tried.  Truly a masterpiece."
4.0,"Had the pleasure of trying this fine malt at a recent tasting. Incredible, in one word! On the palate, a fruity blend right up front and finishing off with the characteristic peat smoke that anyone familiar to Bowmore can appreciate."

Nice, but not stellar.
Definitely wouldn’t pay $400 for a bottle!"

Nose: Toffee and nuts and caramel. Alcohol heat in the nose. 
Palate: Dark fruit/dates. Gentle smokiness. Hazelnuts following. Citrus/orange pops in and out after"

4.25,"Lol. Again, if I paid $500 for this bottle I’d give this a 2 but I didn’t so it’s quite good. Lagavulin 16 is better tho. I have a Talisker 30 that is magnificent. This is really good but it’s a bit thin. It’s nice but at 25 years it should be amazing. Because this was shared with me it gets a 4+ but I give the Talisker 30 a 5 and I paid for it. If I paid for this what I just googled the prices are I’d be a little pissed"

5.0,The best Bowmore I've tasted. Lean and smooth and some Sherry notes. A little bit of smoke hits you to.
3.75,"Smooth, but has a kind of a pungent aftertaste. Not I'd expect for a 25 yr. Old whiskey."
4.5,"Wow, this is from Islay? A rich, slightly peaty Sherry bomb, incredibly complex and flavorful. 96"

4.5,"★★★★½
Bowmore Vertical 4 of 7
That's good and expensive! I don't think I'll ever be rich enough to afford a whisky of that value. More expensive than the 25 Small Batch, I unfortunately found it less interesting. It is an extremely well-balanced whisky where the flavours complement each other perfectly, but there is not only the WOW effect that I felt a year and a half ago with its namesake."
5.0,So smooth and good it’s hard to believe.

4.25,"Hmm, peat, nutts vanilla, slightly sulfuric / tanninic sherry. Initially I thought slightly overwooded. Unlike some drams where the things that bug me get more and more prominent, this whiskey I settle into more and more. Prunes, dark fruit, very interesting dram. It's good but I'm slightly torn on how good,  I think it's one you really need a bottle to work through over time perhaps. Its more complex and has more depth than the 18 from memory but not sure about the balance of certain aspects. By the end I was thinking definitely a 4.25."
