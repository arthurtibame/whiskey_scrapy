5.0,Best $48 Mike McNamee spent
5.0,Scored a bottle at retail after one helluva quest.  Was terrified I'd be disappointed but that wasn't even close to the reality. Thus actually surpassed expectations. The nose is amazing. The balance on the palate is perfect. The finish is long and mellow. It's almost like the whiskey is just absorbed by your mouth with each sip.  I couldn't be happier and don't see how I'll ever find a better bourbon.

5.0,"I was fortunate enough to sip some with a young friend that recently obtained a bottle, Xmas 2015. Wow, very nice. Strong, strong nose of vanilla and other spices. The finish was extremely long and very satisfying. I savored every sip which we both enjoyed neat. Followed it up with the latest Evan Williams 10 Year, Single Barrel Vintage, which has a very nice, strong nose, and it really pointed out the quality of the Pappy, especially the lingering finish."

I went to a swanky bar on 5th ave in Manhattan and I asked the waiter if they had redbreast, bring me it neat, otherwise bring me a list. He brought it to me neat and said ""The bartender would like to commend you on your choice"". It was pretty cool to have that said to me in front of my wife. I felt like I was in a commercial for the stuff. Not sure how this ended up in a pappy review. I like pappy. Just overpriced because of the hype."

Over hyped? No, it's excellent and every bourbon drinker should take advantage if the opportunity comes."

Finish: long, oak, and a little sweet.

Overall: first time trying thus and did not disappoint.  I found the hype to be real. This was delicious all around though the nose stands out as the brightest spot for this one.  Must try if you get the chance."

5.0,"5/6 1/2 oz pours pappy Van Winkle flight. Out of this world, somewhere in between the bright and vibrant 15 and oaky 23. Notes of orange, leather, caramel, chocolate, and coffee with a rye spice finish. Either this or 23 was the best."

4.25,"My coworker hooked me up with a sample of Pappy 20, which I’m super gracious for. I’ll never have this again, so I figure I should write my thoughts 

Look: Dark amber, really shoes it’s age with the color that 20 comes out as. Lacing graces our presence with alcohol legs making an appearance as well. 

Nose: It’s rare that I smell a whisky and think “wow this smells like wood” but Pappy 20 smells like wood. After that note, I get some fruit, really just cherry and some sugary sweet notes, ie brown sugar. Slight spices, not hot notes ala cinnamon but more muted baking spices. 
Edit: All if a sudden, I’m getting peach in the nose and I love that. 

Palate: Good God, this is way hotter and spicier than I would’ve figured. First thing: oak, pepper, followed by some more mellow sweet notes. Brown sugar and vanilla really. I can get some cherry from the nose but it’s not nearly as much. Really, the dominant things I get are spice and oak. 

Finish: Light sweetness, vanilla is absolutely what I get, but there’s plenty of that bitter oak in the finish too. Long lingering, Pappy 20 really has a long finish. 

Overall: okay, as much as you here about Pappy, I’m a bit underwhelmed. After trying enough whisky in my life, I’m realizing I don’t maybe like overly aged bourbon with a lot of oak. That said, still a great bourbon. The stone fruit really bumps up the flavor now that I get that, and bumps the rating up."
4.0,"I can’t pin down the nose on this one (aside from vanilla), but the flavor profile is (of course) woody. In addition, I’m getting some smokey citrus on the backend. Nice, but not what I’d expect for “The #1 rated bourbon in the world “."

4.75,"Nose - Floral with cinnamon, pepper, honey and vanilla, with oak, leather and sweet pipe tobacco balancing it out. 

Palate - Delicate and nicely balanced with a burst of spice that doesn’t overwhelm, with pepper, cinnamon, honey, brown sugar, with molasses and vanilla evening it out. 

Finish - Oak, cinnamon and a touch of honey and corn sweetness linger for a long, smooth finish."

5.0,I must say it seemed like forever before the opportunity to try this presented itself.  I have had plenty of excellent bourbons before and while I was expecting this to disappoint it did not.  I’m fairly sure I’d never pay the insane secondary price for it but it did jump into my top three or four bourbons I have ever had.  I am a fan of the oak forward palate which presents almost an oak and cherry pie flavor.  Finish was super long and kept me going back in for more.  Truly excited and glad I got to try it.

4.5,"Well damn. The nose is like pralines and cream ice cream, with toffee, caramel, freshly baked blondies, oak, oak, and more delicious oak. There’s also a note something like leaves in the Fall. Incredibly balanced and somehow not too oaky. The palate brings toasted candied pecans into focus, with a rich caramel, and a heavy toasted oak presence. The oaky tones almost remind me of the Rhetoric 24, but without the notes of the lumber department at Home Depot. There’s also a pleasant spice balancing out a modest sweetness. Much like the nose, the palate shows incredible balance and complexity. One flavor just flows into the next. The finish, which goes on for ages, is straight dark caramel, vanilla, and more oaky oakness. Oak. Damn this is good. 

$50 USD for a 1 oz pour"

4.75,"It might sound like fantasy, but here in my hometown Guayaquil, Ecuador, there is a man that has a lot of Pappy bottles and some other very, very fancy bourbouns, and he found out i was a whisky enthusiast and a critic, so he invited me to his house along with other friends to a tasting and i got to say, we drank some very, very, very fancy and expensive bourbon yesterday. 

I got drunk drinking pappy. Lots of it. The 12yo, the 15yo and the 20yo. I believe that my organs are now golden.

Well, lets do this. Pappy 20yo is as expensive as it is scarce. It is an unicorn. It is practically unreachable. I have had the 12yo (lot b) which was great and it was the favorite of the host of the tasting; and, i have had the 15yo (and had it again yesterday) and i got to say the 15yo is the best by far, making this 20yo the second best, because of something that some expensive old whiskies have: fancy tasting notes and easy drinkable character, but not the complexity we whisky enthusiasts/critics want.

45.2% abv, chesnut color. Beautiful. (90.4 proof actually).

On the nose it has a lot going on: Banana, Cherry, strawberry, Super refined and fancy vanilla, Prunes, lots of Maple syrup, Herbal Fresh forest notes. 

On the palate is very pleasant and easy drinkable. Maybe too easy drinkable. You just dont feel 45.2%abv is happening here due to its smoothness. 
Mostly oaky but in the most beautiful way, Herbal notes, a rye sweetness/spicyness, and Prunes. It could be better. 

Aftertaste is heavenly. Is where it gets all the points  Ashy and the most amazing ginger spiciness ever. Eternal aftertaste. Amazing.

Very balanced, very well crafted. Overall i give this superb bourbon a 96 over 100, and ill stick to Pappy 15yo. Slainte my friends!"

With all that spice on the nose and the expectation of a strong kick in the mouth, I was surprised at how smooth it was. Almost as if I was smelling one whiskey and tasting a different one. 

The flavors and mouthfeel frankly make me question what all the hype is about. For what was there, it is not worth $75 a pour. 

Don't get me wrong. It is still a good whiskey. I am glad I was able to try it. I was just expecting more. I cannot find the justification for charging $75 for a pour of something that frankly doesn't taste better than a $40 bottle of something else."
