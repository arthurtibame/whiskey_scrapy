4.0,"Tasted 10/15/2014 : Not being a huge fan of Jack Daniels (as a sipping whiskey), I was curious about this and had the opportunity to taste.  This starts off on the nose with a strong banana nose; more intense than the Old No. 7. Brown sugar/caramel sweetness in present all around.  Similar to fried bananas with a brown sugar glaze.  Exceptionally rounded, full and sweet palate.  A bit of burn in the back of the tongue. This finishes sweet and clean.  Very good to enjoy neat.  Pleasantly surprised. Is it worth $150-200?  Definitely worth the effort to get a taste."

2.0,"Spicy slightly more intense nose than the no. 7. Initial mouthful is the usual Jack flavors, caramel, spice, orange, and sweet throughout.  The finish is like licking the barrel.  The oaky notes overwhelm this one, and leave you reluctant to finish the glass.  Adding a little water mellows the sweet stickiness, but seems to intensify the taste of barrel.  For me, at around 1/4th of the cost, Jack Single Barrel or Gentleman Jack each have a much more balanced and well rounded flavor."

5.0,They claim this was how Jack tasted in the 50's and 60's - why did they ever change?  This is very smooth and favorable - yes - nector of the gods baby!
3.0,"Tastes unlike any other whisky.  Viscous, with a slight artificial taste... Lots of orange . Ultimately not worth the price to anyone but collectors ... Stick with the single barrel variety which is a more complex, better and  significantly cheaper."

3.5,"Spicy wood, honey, apples, and vanilla on the nose. Tingles the lips, but smooth on the palate. Floats above the tongue, like the juice never touches the taste buds. Unique in that way. The flavors come toward the back, it's pleasantly sweet, medium finish with nutmeg and cinnamon spices that blend with the apple and vanilla. Starts to pinch but never quite  follows through with a bite. Smooth sipper.  5/31/17"

3.0,"This review was transferred over from the Barreled App:


I have a hard time rating Jack Daniels.  I used to drink bourbon exclusively mixed with Coca Cola.  I was never much of an on-the-rocks guy when I was younger.  I really loved JD before switching to the cheaper Jim Beam when I drank B&C's.  Now that my focus is on scotch whisky and the occasional neat bourbon, I have a hard time seeing what the fuss was ever really about.  I'm trying to appreciate other whiskies, it's just taking a bit longer to get with the program.

That said, this is a fantastic (albeit expensive) version of JD.  I'm glad a friend brought it to the whisk(e)y tasting tonight.  I never would've paid what this bottle costs for a chance to sample it.  It's  ultra smooth and that makes it a fitting tribute to Frank, I suppose.  If you really like Jack then I'd say seek it out, but if you have moved on to more adventurous whiskey you should maybe skip this and put those funds into something that might give you a more interesting experience.  Cheers."

4.0,"Tasting:  1.5 oz pour, neat in rocks glass.

Nose (3.75):  Apricots, apple, vanilla are forward.  There is smokiness in the background.  Not especially mind blowing on the nose, but enough to entice.

Palate (4.0):  Lots of vanilla and perhaps peach and honey.  It has a sweetness much different then I get from regular Jack which was good.  Oily mouthfeel that coats the palate well.  The signature Jack Daniels smoke comes in at the back of the palate but not in the aggressive ""charcoal and sticks"" way the traditional JD does.  Much smoother.

Finish (4.25):  Shines on a medium to long finish.  The smoke continues with just a puff but then gives way to honeycrisp apples, and a bit of sweet tea.  Lingers on the taste buds for a good long time making you want more.

Overall:  A very good dram.  Not sure if the bottle price justifies it.   I would like to try side by side with the barrel select and judge the difference.  My thought is that the barrel select is the better bargain.  Advice-  try it first before you invest in a bottle.  At under $100 it would be a hit.  But where it is currently priced it is in with some competition.  I would say though Jack Daniels has upped their game."

This whiskey wasn’t as similar to JD #7 as I expected.  You can tell it had some influence, but it’s more of a distance cousin than a brother or sister. And the banana flavor that seems unmistakable in JD #7 is almost absent here. 

There are very few American whiskeys that I enjoy as much as a decent Scotch, but this is one of them."

3.5,"Im on vacations and i can get my hands on some special whiskies. This one is the case. The Sinatra expression of Jack Daniel's is very very very alike the old No. 7, but smoother. That would be the perfect description for it.

45%abv, amber color.

On the nose: is just like the old no. 7 but with hints of smoke. Prunes and that typical sweet/sourness from JD.

On the palate: also a lot like the standard old no. 7 but Smoother. Spicier, peppery but pleasant. Sour but not Too sour. Very easy to drink.

Finish is a little oaky, also very smooth. Actually a nice version of Jack Daniels but not fot $150 that it costs. (Although the bottle is very pretty).

Overall it would be fair to rate this one with a solid 73 over 100. Cheers!"
