1.75,"The stout finish comes across in the nose as an almost tea-like scent which is very strong. There is a grassy note too.

The taste is less pleasant for me, as someone who does not like many stouts. The same tea-like nose is present in the taste, and 
the whiskey flavor while muted is balanced. There is a clear sweetness where I notice some chocolate. Unfortunately that faded quickly leaving me with a long, long lasting tea/stout aftertaste.

Not something I will drink again. If you like experimental whiskeys and stout it might be more up your alley.
