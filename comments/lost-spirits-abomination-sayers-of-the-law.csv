4.25,An excellent dram. Great balance of peat and sweetness. Lacks a touch of depth but very fine!

2.75,Lots of peat. Obvious that the maker likes peat and smoke. Hides any complexity that may be there.

3.5,"The nose is surprisingly sweet, vanilla, BBQ sauce, dried apricots, a few drops of iodine and, since this is Islay juice, drenched in loads of vegetal peat. A savoury, salty palate of white pepper, burnt espresso shot but also sweet, a dash of charred vanilla and dried apricots. A medium finish, with iodine, smoke and salty, reminiscent of mezcal."

4.0,Saltiness of Kilchoman but not as much iodine (though it’s there).  A little simple in flavor but very nice! Worth getting a bottle if cheap
