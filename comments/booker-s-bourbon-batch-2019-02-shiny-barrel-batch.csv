1.0,"This is the most disappointing bourbon I’ve tried this year. The nose hits you with a sharp ethanol with a hint of sweetness. And the ethanol persists on the palate. For the most part, the palate consists of pepper and leather, but the overwhelming yet quick heat takes any potential flavor with it. The finish, described by some as medium, was insanely quick. I got the sensation of pop rocks in my mouth as the alcohol singed my tastebuds. 

With 3-7 drops of water, the heat toned down a bit to reveal more leather and char. I do not get the sweetness or corn many say they do.

Overall, 1/5"

4.5,"Bottle neat into Glencairn at home.  Nose is gorgeous, with the alcohol fire tempered by vanilla, cognac, butterscotch, lite grains, apple, oak.  Tons going on here.  Taste is robust, with  more oak and vanilla coming on, lingering heat, still getting the apple and vanilla. Finish goes on forever, and is really nice.  Big fan.  6/8/19"
4.25,"Nose: ethanol right out of the bottle. After breathing a minute , wow dill like I’m sniffing a pickle jar. Charred oak and vanilla is hiding in the back. Leather and rubber later
Palate: creamy oil, brown sugar, caramel
Finish: long and hot, cinnamon, barrel spice, char"

5.0,Wow! Spicy vanilla treat.
4.25,"Massive, unfiltered, double-barreled blast of a bourbon. Heat and spicy notes immediately evident on the nose. Intense heat and flavors overwhelm palate, but a few more sips allow the senses to appreciate rich, multi-layered flavor: spice, cinnamon, oak, a little vanilla, oil, butter. Delicious finish lasts a long time. A touch of water can make this unfiltered heater more approachable. Not for everyone or every mood, but when craving a big, bold roller coaster ride of a pour there's little better!"
3.5,"Love Booker’s but have to say this is my least favorite. The nose is good, spice and sweetness, but the mouth is very astringent."
4.0,"Allowing myself plenty of time to let this whiskey settle in my glencairn glass.  The whiff of alcohol is intense right away.  10 minutes later...

Nose:
(Suprisingly) old oak; almost like a dusty oak.  Hints of vanilla, spice and caramel.  Some sort of fruit I'm picking up; almost like artificial banana.  Prominent nut and grain flavor. Quite nice, once the fumes dissipated. 

Arrival:
You feel the high a.b.v. right away, but it's not overbearing. New oak and char flavor.  Slightly solventy, but with hints of dried fruit.  Classic Booker's taste and burn. I believe this is the sweetest part of tasting this whiskey.

Development:
Goes from woody/oaky and nutty to bits of spice and dry cellar wood. 

Finish:
Lingering finish and medium mouthfeel.  I get hints of leathery/oily oats.  Tails of on the bitter side, but that's okay with me.

Overall, I feel this is a very enjoyable bourbon, though I wouldn't consider it in the dessert category.  It's a very complex bourbon, which I like, and should be given time to open up and linger in the glass a bit.  I'm looking forward to seeing how this opens up while in the bottle a year from now.

4.75,"I’m a Booker’s fan.
This expression is 124 proof, yet it doesn’t assault the nose. Instead, pleasant aromas of honey & vanilla, with hints of butter and cinnamon. Sipping neat offers a spiced brown sugar (maybe a touch of anise), and some pepper striking between the tastebuds & nostrils. Delicious oakiness."
4.75,"Unctuous mouth feel, deep caramel color, vanilla and spice that transitions to dark notes of chocolate...simply delicious! At 124 ABV, this may be the the sweet spot for Bookers which tends more towards 126-127 proof...A must buy!!!"

4.25,"Just as big and sweet as I was expecting. Not as harsh as you might expect, but water definitely opens it up to more layers. In my opinion, a consistent gem on the market. Not too many uncut/unfiltered bourbons on the market you can always find at your local Target! Consistently delicious!!"
4.0,Plenty of heat with some toffee. Heavier mouthful. Some spice and almost savory. A couple drops of water brought out richer chocolatey notes.

4.5,"Next on my Charlotte NC sample lost was this very tasty Booker's batch. I was underwhelmed by this year's first batch (Teresa's batch) and was hoping this would be an improvement. Let's see if it was:

Upon entry it's classic Booker's. Very oily, rich and mouthcoating. Big charred oak note leads the way with a plethora of dark fruits, cocoa and roasted peanuts. Everything I love in Booker's!! Mid palette adds more char, orange peel and slight spice. Finish is long with more oak, chocolate covered peanuts and a soft spice. 

It's smooth as silk for 124 proof and is right up there with the Kentucky Chew batch for me. This is the Booker's profile I really enjoy. If you liked Kentucky Chew or Kitchen Table this will be for you. 

Cheers all!"

4.25,"On the nose, lots of vanilla and sweet spicyness. At 62%, this is hot and water really opens it up. There’s vanilla, caramel, spices, sweetness but not cloying, a slightly bitter finish. Complex and balanced, I like this but I don’t love it. 93"

4.5,"Nose: Brown sugar, vanilla, oak, char.  Buttermilk biscuits.  Cheap dessert marischino cherries, peanuts.  Cinnamon, clove, cumin.  Slight eucalyptus and citrus oil hit in the very back.

Palate: Brown sugar, vanilla, oak, char all show up.  Warm buttermilk biscuits with butter.  Roasted peanuts.  Baking spices - cinnamon, clove, nutmeg.  Prickly alcohol.    Citrus oil shows up if you let it roll on your tongue for a while.  Hot, but in a really appealing way."

4.5,High proof is apparent in the best way. Sweet and spicy with a long finish. Very good.
4.75,"Been looking for this for a while.  Comes in wooden box with plexiglass front panel adding to the special nature of this bourbon. Poured neat, nose is surprisingly subdued. There's nutty caramel, cinnamon, dry cocoa and oak but the proof is masked. Yeah there is ethanol but not what you would expect. There is also a delightful maypo cereal note that I love! As it rests baking spices(nutmeg/clove etc)come in and the nutty notes step up to the front. Palate is rich and succulent with amazing refinement and sophistication for such a high proof. Caramel and cashew explode with spicy cinnamon, melted butterscotch, real maple syrup and toasted oak joining in but it all backs down and evens out to an elegance Ive only experienced with high end scotch. Ive never had Pappy but this is what I would imagine it would be like with all the hype. The mouthfeel is oily and wonderfully thick and sustains all the way through to finish. Fading cinnamon, caramel and spicy oak combine with cocoa powder, maple butter and gourmet premium nuts to produce a long satisfying end to this masterpiece. Gets better with each pour as more flavors get teased out and complexity increases. It is remarkable as it drinks like a 90 proof wolf in sheep's clothing. The flavors are powerful yet the silky smooth delivery is unrivaled. This batch is truly magnificent bourbon imo...........98/100.........best of the best of the best as Will Smith said in MIB...the overriding nutty caramel butterscotch quality balanced with perfect oak is fantastic and the lack of heat interference at 124pf is hard to believe. Be careful as this will kick in despite easy time emptying your glass. Highest recommendation......Spend some time with this, at first taste I figured around a 94 score but it kept improving and developing until I realized this is absolute bourbon perfection...... I will be buying another bottle of this batch before its gone regardless of price, maybe two or three, hell if I can get a case I will"
4.5,"This is $95/bottle at my local store. Found it at a bar for $12/pour (neat & at least 3 fingers)! I really like it. I feel like vanilla and caramel nose with cinnamon stick spice on the palate, but what do I know? It’s good. At 120+ proof I probably shouldn’t have had a 2nd...Wish it weren’t a hundred bucks a bottle or I’d buy it. I’ll keep coming to this bar on the Company’s dime and buy it with dinner!!!"

5.0,"Booker's Shiny Barrel Batch is the second Booker's release for 2019. The barrels that are selected for each batch come from the center of the rickhouses and are bottled at barrel proof and are not chill-filtered. It is said that when Booker Noe retired, his one request to his son Fred was ""make sure they don't mess with my Booker's.""
There's some conflicting information about when Booker's expression was first introduced. In fact, Booker's own website states that Booker Noe coined the term ""small batch"" and it was introduced in 1992. Yet, the last batch released in 2018 was a 30th Anniversary batch, which would put the first released year at 1988. The Bourbon Exchange site shows batches released as early as 1979, however.
""Shiny Barrel"" is an affectionate term given to barrels that get sampled the most by the rickhouse workers. As the saying goes, ""the shinier the barrel, the sweeter the whiskey,"" the best barrels tend to be a bit more polished from the workers leaning over them to sample the contents a lot more frequently.
Each batch of Booker's has a label on the bottle that gives the name of the batch, official batch number, age, proof and ABV.
On the nose, Shiny Barrel packs a punch with dried berry fruit, familiar Jim Beam peanut note, charred oak, leather, and vanilla. The palate is big with the many of the same flavors found on the nose plus cinnamon brown sugar, toffee, and some heavy barrel char and a bit black pepper spice. The finish is fairly long and mouthwatering with chocolate, candied orange peels, and nutty all with a nice gentle warmth that spreads down the chest. This is a batch that does not disappoint!"

3.75,"A good Bourbon, but not a great Bourbon especially at the premium price point. Not enough viscosity, flavor, and complexity to back up the significant burn IMO. Has plenty of the Beam funk as noted in the other reviews which is its most unique characteristic. Overall, I like it, but don’t like it enough to purchase another bottle for 80 bucks. If this 6-year old dram was priced correctly at $50-$60 I would always have one on hand. WT Rare Breed is money better spent."

4.5,"🥃 Booker's 2019-02 Shiny Barrel Batch - 62% ABV
⠀
Nose: Strong oaky Beam nose. Wow. Baking spices. Maybe some candied oranges.
⠀
Taste: Stunningly delicious at the start. Sweet burnt molasses with some citric fruitiness. Transitions pretty quickly to intense oak domination. Long drying tannic finish that becomes almost minty from the heat and dryness.

The unfiltered texture envelopes your tongue and leaves an astringent and significant alcohol heat that i don't recall from the previous batch, Teresa's Batch 2019-01. Overall, the intense oaky finish makes up 75% of the experience. I think it goes into the oak punch too quickly for me. It's obviously well crafted stuff and quite tasty, but just not my preferred Booker's style. A slight bit of water may help move this closer to perfection - I'll report back another time.

4.25,"This has some scotch richness on the nose. The nose is surprisingly subdued though. The palate is very rich with harsh spices and tannins immediately coming out, but then rich chocolate and toffee. The tannins are soft but pervasive with clove numbingness quickly kicking in. The finish has a touch of mineral sweetness emerge that tastes like fresh spring water. The woody element is unavoidable in the spice, but, it tastes more in-place and mature than in Booker's Kitchen Table. The balance is very harmonious, despite being less sweet than Booker's Kitchen Table. The rich sweetness is great with lots of vanilla. The end result is a lot like Stagg Jr., but maybe a little bit better? The balance isn't quite as great with water added, but it's still a really good drink. This is a stellar example of what a bourbon can be. The wood does show itself a bit much, but it's well in hand and give a bit of an earthy, natural flavor. It's surprising that this tastes substantially older than Booker's Kitchen Table."

4.5,"BACKGROUND: Each year, Jim Beam releases four high-proof batches under its Booker's label in honor of former master distiller Booker Noe. The bourbon used to complete each batch is personally selected by Booker's son, Fred Noe, and given a name along with a description explaining its origin. The ""Shiny Barrel"" batch is a 124-proof bourbon that is aged 6 years, 5 months, and 1 day and comes from varying floors in four different warehouses. The description provided for the ""Shiny Barrel"" name reads:

Back in the day, some of the distillery’s rackhouse workers would carry around “mules” – pieces of plastic tubing they carried in the front of their overalls – and use them to thief out a taste of whiskey (or two) straight from an aging barrel. Some of these men had, shall we say, prominent physiques.When they went in for a taste, their bellies would rub on the side of the barrel, removing dust and shining it up. Some used to say, “the shinier the barrel, the sweeter the whiskey,” and most often, Dad would find these shiny barrels in the center cut of the rackhouse where the temperature and humidity were just right.

I was eager to get my hands on a bottle and give it a try, and it did not disappoint.

NOSE: Like most of its products, this Booker's has the traditional ""Beam funk"" on the nose, but it also smells gloriously like the inside of a rickhouse (i.e. - oak and must and age even though it is only six-year-old). There is a bit of vanilla on the nose, which Booker Noe supposedly insisted all of his best bourbons possessed. The nose is also ethanol-heavy and caused my eyes to cross a bit on the first whiff even though I used the open-mouth nosing method.

PALATE: The bourbon not only tastes like thick, syrupy molasses, but it also coats the mouth like molasses. It's a wonderful mouth feel. The other predominant flavors are oak...oak...and oak with, perhaps, a bit of citrus lingering in the background. Despite its alcohol-heavy nose, there is no intense alcohol kick upon first sip.

FINISH: Though the initial palate does not offer much alcohol, the finish provides heat and hug for days. The rich taste of caramel also develops in the finish though not on the palate. The Beam peanut taste makes its presence known on the finish, as well.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: It is difficult to believe how much this bourbon changes and develops from front of mouth to back of throat. I know that many Booker's aficionados have said the first two batches of 2019 were lackluster and saved most of their love for the ""County Ham"" and ""Beaten Biscuits"" offerings, but I found ""Shiny Barrel"" to be a great treat. Though I typically drink bourbon neat and in a glencairn glass, I might try Shiny Barrel with water or an ice cube to see how it further develops. Shiny Barrel is yet another fine release in the impressive line of Booker's products.  I give it four-and-a-half cork pops out of five."
