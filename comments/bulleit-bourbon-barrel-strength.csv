2.0,"I still prefer the original Bulleit as my ""daily sipper"" of choice, but this is a decent bottle in its own right. Not as good as its high-proof bretheren that I've tasted (Maker's Mark Cask Strength and Booker's come to mind), I still appreciate the tastes that make Bulleit's brands among my early bourbon favorites. The sweet, marshmallowy caramel taste gives way to a smooth, spicy burn, and the fruit tastes at the end linger nicely. It's a solid pickup when I'm in the Kentucky area."

Got this for $35, I think it may have been mis priced with regular Bulleit?  Anyway, not too familiar with regular bulleit, I’ve tried it some time ago before really getting into bourbon and didn’t care one way or the other, I really just purchased this because of the discounted price.  Boy was I pleasantly surprised. 

Tasted with one cube. I like neat usually but with this proof will add ice.

Smoother than some other barrel proofs that I love, but also still tasty enough to warrant a spot in a BP rotation."

  #25: Bulleit Barrel Strength.  Kentucky Straight Bourbon.  62.7% ABV.  Batch 5
  Paid $55
  I’m a relative newcomer to the bourbon journey, and I’ll probably replace this with another untried brand’s barrel strength rather than buy another bottle once it’s done.
  
  This is the highest ABV, and also most challenging dram on the list.  Challenging not so much in the complex-and-contemplative sense; but more in the is-this-going-to-give-me-mouth-and-throat-cancer? sense.  Neat, Bulleit BS is potent butterscotch, firewood on fire, and the transition goes from mouthwatering sweet to mouthpuckering dry.  You can add water until this is 40% ABV, it will still burn due to the high rye mashbill, not so much alcohol.  This is almost too sweet and too hot.  These crazy Americans almost make peaty Scotches feel meh.

This is one tasty Bourbon. The most striking element is just how darn smooth it is at this high proof. Upon entry you are hit with a big caramel note. Transitions into baking spices on the mid pallette with a lovely long oak, and cocao finish. It tastes just like my raw cocoa nibs! While thisay not pack the flavor punch of ECBP or Stagg Jr, it is far smoother. If you are new to barrel proof bourbon. This is one for you. If you are a fan of ECBP or Stagg Jr, buy this! 4.5/5.

First, was every bit of its high proof. Tons of heat going in and on the palate... spicy.... I really wasn’t feeling it. I did have a second taste later in the evening because I wanted to give it another chance and I’m glad I did. Although it was still hot at the nose, I felt it settled nicely on the palate this time. Still had some heat but not as overpowering... perhaps because it opened up a bit since sitting? Either way, I did enjoy the Bulleit. Would I buy another bottle myself... probably not, but I wouldn’t shy away from it if offered for sure."

Now a little addition of water actually thickened this bourbon up a bit, as weird as that sounds.

Bulleit sources high-rye bourbons for its entire lineup, and this uncut, undiluted version is the spiciest yet, as if infused with anise, cardamom, fennel, and black pepper.  It's also decadently sweet with some good acidity for balance, like an orange marmalade or spiced honey.  This is not a particularly old bourbon, so it doesn't feature many oak or wood notes, but it's a winner.  Let it sit for a few minutes before sipping, as that heavy alcohol punch needs some time to dissipate.  $52 in the gift shop is a great price nowadays for a cask-strength bourbon, so the extra value premium bumps this bottle up in my ratings.  I'm not sure what batch this was, but it was 62.7% ABV."

Overall....I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase. The fact that it's bottled at 122 proof is truly remarkable. Once it has time to open up it really shines. Suddenly herbal and grassy notes come to fruition. It's quite a bourbon, offering such distinctive yet diverse flavors pour after pour.. Well worth the cost...."

4.0,The spice and graham cracker which must be the “toasted marshmallow” described is fantastic. The mouthfeel on this being uncut and unfiltered is exactly what I want from a bourbon. Great way for someone to jump into barrel strength bourbon without killing your pocket book. A must buy for any high proof fan.

Taste: a blast of pepper and spice with notes of maple syrup
Finish: strong and lingering, pepper lasts on the tongue with notes of vanilla and marshmallow complimenting the spice
Really opens up with a splash of water"

3.5,"So I’ve been drinking this off and on usually when on sale but felt the need to review it on here.
Nose: so upfront there’s a little bit of ethanol that kind of helps keep the fact that you’re sipping a 60%+ bourbon in mind. 
When pushing past that I get hints of almost orange pledge or peels with after hints of a sweeter scent maybe hints of honey ?
Palate: so surprisingly there’s hardly any burn it’s more orange , rye spice and Caramel.
The finish is nice and long but gentle nothing too too harsh for the proof but you’ll taste it on the exhale for a few breathes for sure. 
Overall I always usually take price into account with overall product because I rarely spend over $60 on a bottle unless I KNOW it’s worth it!
This is a solid 86 given price account and flavor profile ! It’s affordable,packed full of flavor and always available! 
I prefer rare breed over this but not always and sometimes this hits the spot better!if never tried is solidly recommend !"

4.0,"Smell: ethanol of course, with a strong oak smell masking the relatively subtle hints of black pepper, old leather, vanilla, and a bit of maple. 

Tastes similar, very strong flavor, yet pretty drinkable. There’s a slight nuttiness to the flavor. It’s pretty much common straight bourbon flavors with higher rye content, but done well so that you can drink this easily enough for 127 proof. Overall, it’s got very bold flavors, but nice and drinkable, nothing too out of the ordinary on the flavor profile."

3.5,"This smells kind of like citrus fruit and it tastes kind of like it too. There is some nice clean orange with that familiar high proof alcohol. It's sweet with a refreshingly clean alcohol flavor. This may be Bulleit's answer to Knob Creek Single Barrel. The tartness and mineral work really well with the orange, as does the hint of apricot. The barrel is relatively understated, but it is still good. I really enjoy this. Water opens it up a bit, cutting down on that beautiful citrus but bringing out some nice wood. It doesn't have that nice robust aged flavor and endless complexity, but it does have a nice clean flavor with a few things going on. The smoke does elevate it beyond alcohol and balances the sweetness. There's eventually some nuttiness here that I really appreciate. There's some almond, hazelnut, and coconut. If the nuts stood out more, this could be a really amazing bourbon. The complexity eventually becomes quite good, but it takes its time. The spiciness is quite pronounced with a mix of cinnamon and black pepper, as well as maybe a bit of clove, but it is not overwhelming despite being really strong. This is a great drink that is gradually complex and well worth sipping. There might be a hint of maple and something medicinal going on here."
4.5,"We run blind tastings and this one recently came out on top in a good lineup of previous winners. I am hoping there is some consistency from bottle to bottle. From nose to finish, this one has great sweet and spicy balance."

4.0,Vanilla Carmel eucalyptus on nose. Same on palate. Lots of spice in the palate as well. Finish is long. Overall it’s a nice enjoyable sip without a load of complexity but plenty of balance and bite and I like the sweet eucalyptus notes.
4.0,"Fruity, caramel, smokey, and pretty strong."
3.0,"Surprisingly smooth for a barrel strength. Silky and sweet, but not much complexity."

4.0,On the nose I get charred citrus and oak. The palate gives more of the citrus and spicy oily oak. Nice finish that lingers.
3.75,Very hot
3.0,"Nose of ethanol, wet oak, more ethanol, some leather and spice but nothing rich or warm which I would expect for such a high proof.  Palate is hot and thin but more vanilla and oak than the nose would suggest.  Not terrible but seems too thin for the proof and much better options out there for the $."
