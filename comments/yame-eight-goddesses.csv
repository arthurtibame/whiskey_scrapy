4.5,"Caramel and fruity hint of vanilla, an okay hint and followed by a strong floral finish.  Fans of the Japanese whiskey would enjoy this very much.  It doesn't have the peaty of spicy note at all.  

Right or of the bottle remind me of a different variations of the nikka Coffey grain whisky.  Smooth and good everyday drink.  I usually find peaty and spicy notes are better during winter or when I'm down and in need of reflection.... However, I can't seem to find a lot of information on this bottle.  At $60-70 this is not cheap.... But surprisingly good.

I would recommend"

5.0,Took a gamble on this and was pleasantly surprised. Sweet and goes down easy. Like liquid tropical pancakes. Reasonably priced for a Japanese whisky.
5.0,"In the days of inflated Japanese whisky prices, this is a steal. This is very smooth and tastes like liquid banana foster. Caramel, Bananas, Coconut, Vanilla. Its sweet and tropical flavors perfectly suit the tropical flavors of Fukuoka in Kyushu Island in Southern Japan"

2.0,"Everytime I come to Denver on a business trip, I try to bring a sample pour with me, hoping to have it after ridiculously long days.  I should’ve picked something well sherried or peated, considering how cold it is here , with snow on the mountains adding a scenic background.  But I chose this, out of curiosity, a sample graciously provided by @jonwilkinson7309 

I can’t find much about this one.  Yes, it’s 10 yrs old and it’s Japanese...but is it really Japanese as in made in Japan, or is it sourced from elsewhere, shipped to Japan, and labeled Japanese?  I’m guessing it’s not truly Japanese—-very few fall in that category ( Yamazaki, Hibiki, Yoichi, a few others).  But either way....doesn’t matter if the liquid is good.  

So...on to it:
It’s slightly aromatic, but not as much as I’d expect from a 10 yr Japanese (I’m thinking Hibiki 12 or Yoichi 10).  Taste is light , with fresh bakery bread taste.  Slightly floral.  Would be great in cocktails or over ice in summer.  

Overall—-I’m not sure you’re really having a Japanese whiskey here, more like Scottish Lowlander aged 10 yrs in ex-bourbon.  But —-what it has over the Japanese whiskeys is that it won’t break your bank.  It’s actually affordable—-more in the territory of Hibiki Harmony.  Between this and Harmony, it’s a toss up...both are about the same.  Slight edge to Harmony on nose, but edge to Yama on having an age statement 

Thanks @jonwilkinson7309 for the pour!  Was a welcomed drink after a 15 hour day"

4.0,"This is a very subtle whisky. I don't get a lot on the nose, just a hint of ethanol. A very soft apricot on the taste, with nutmeg, perhaps. The finish lingers a little, but is very pleasant, and just slightly warming. I could sit with this for some time while I was doing other things like reading, or writing whisky reviews."
