null,"Not a fan. It was on sale for $45 and I had a $5 credit for TW&M so I decided to give it a shot. HEAVY perfume on the nose. Very little sweetness. Plenty of spice. If you’re a fan of the Filibuster Rye this may be for you, but otherwise I’d stick to something a little more established and reviewed if you’re in the $50 price range. For cross reference against your pallet I love Pikesville Rye for a Spicy, rich flavorful rye and Woodinville for a slightly less spicy rich flavorful rye. For a more mild rye I enjoy Sazerac. And Rittenhouse and Old Forrester are my go to’s for a great budget rye. Hope this is helpful as I couldn’t get much of a read on the Oregon Spirit Rye from my research."
