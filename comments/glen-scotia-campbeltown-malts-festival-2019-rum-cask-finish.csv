4.0,"Aroma is shockingly oaky with a profile that moves from sweet to earthy and back; Palate is good, but lacks some of the depth the aroma carries and has less of the rum notes till water is added; Finish is pleasant and changes more sip-to-sip than most whiskys but stays on an earthy-smoky, herbal-spicy and lightly sweet track."

4.5,"Amazing whisky. Full of flavor and the wood and vanilla of the rum cask are there, but not overly present. A beautiful light peat to compliment the sweet sides of this whisky to make it a well rounded but complex taste."
