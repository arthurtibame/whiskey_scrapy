4.25,"I spotted this rather unique bottle sitting on a dusty shelf in a local package store. I’m still not sure how it ended up there in the first place because this is Fireball and Miller Lite country, not single malt country. 

The fact that I couldn’t find very much information on this spirit combined with its relatively low cost led me to believe that this could be an amazing find. 

The bottle states that it was distilled in 1998 and bottled in 2015, meaning that it had been sitting around, unopened for 5 years. It’s a single cask expression bottled at cask strength, which is fairly common in bourbon, but unusual for a scotch. 

Upon breaking the seal and opening the bottle I am greeted by a floral honey aroma. The 58% abv content is quite evident in the way that the ethanol notes sting the inside of my nose. It’s not an unpleasant or harsh sensation but it does establish the fact that this is potent stuff. 

The first few sips that I took were accompanied by an unpleasant sulfur taste that seemed to get worse with each subsequent sip. I tried adding water incrementally but the dank stank persisted. The whisky finished with a long, potent raisin note that reminded me of cheap cognac. 

I was disappointed with my first tasting of this but I decided I’d let it rest for a few days to mingle with the newly-introduced oxygen in the bottle. 

My second tasting was dramatically different! That deliciously floral aroma is still present upon opening the bottle and I can now detect some bourbony notes as well. The sulfuric flavor has vanished altogether and I am greeted by a warm, full-bodied flavor bursting with honey and sherry notes. The raisiny finish is still present but it’s definitely smoother and more nuanced than before. 

I admit that I’m not very familiar with Speyside malts as most of my experience comes from bourbon and Islay scotch, but I do know that this stuff is excellent quality and quite unlike anything I’ve ever tried before. I’m going to hold onto this bottle for a while and only break it out on “special occasions.” I’m excited to see how it improves with further oxidation!"
