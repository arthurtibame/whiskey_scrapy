4.25,"Smooth nose of golden butterscotch hard candy and real maple syrup. Velvety mouthfeel, full and rich and prominent mouth tingle but no negative burn, like the droplet of a freshly plucked honeysuckle flower or fresh squeezed sweet sugar cane. An unexpected minty and herbal aftertaste. Complex and easy to sip. Very, very good!!!"

4.25,"Initially had wood shavings and dry sawdust notes to a classic bourbon base.  Then it opens up with huge earthy, wet soil notes that take this to another level. A little rough, but don’t read into it, it’s just a tad bit edgy. Well done from whatever cask this came from. And the price point, hands down the best bourbon you could have!"
2.75,A bit heavy on the corn whiskey flavor for something aged 10 years. Other light bits of caramel and vanilla are present but for 45% it has a much stronger taste. As opposed the the Nicholson reserve I tasted it against.

3.75,Good but not my fav. Had this at Doc Crow’s in Louisville along with McKenna 10 Yr Single Barrel (Bottled in Bond) which I liked much better.
3.75,Flavorful aroma. A bit sharp but add ice or water for a pleasant experience
4.5,"Good, pretty smooth"
4.25,Very smooth affordable bourbon.  Nice hints of spice and oak.  Smooth sweetness from corn mash. Subtle caramel notes throughout and on finish
3.75,Carmel on the nose with a nutty body and chocolate after taste

3.5,This bottle is a single barrel from wearhouse K 5th floor.  It is labeled dark fruit for a reason.  It has a distinct smell of dark cherries.  Almost like a red wine.  Very sweet in the beginning but finishes with a taste of tartness.
4.5,"If spice was smooth, it’d be ER10"
3.5,"Starts smooth, but ends with a burn"

4.0,"Gordon's Single Barrel Select 
Barrel #221
Barreled on 03-09-2009

Deep copper color. Sweet on the nose with notes of cinnamon, cherry pie filing, Twizzlers, honey and a little oak. Mouthfeel is rich and warm, a little dry. Not as sweet on the palate as the nose suggests, with dark cherries, cinnamon graham crackers, honeysuckle, walnuts, and a peppery spice with oak tannins on the back of the palate. Finish is medium-long and dry, with more cherries, black pepper and oak."

4.0,Pleasant nose with honey values. Forward flavors are vanilla and a light spicy heat. The honey appears in the later flavors along with toasted almond notes. Very smooth finish.

3.25,"Specs pick. It’s a little thinner overall than the original, but it has a vibrant vanilla cream aroma and flavor. Cinnamon and oak round out the palate. Damn good for the $16 price tag on a 375ml bottle."

2.0,"Eagle rare Store pick (Tequila town) 
Nose- powdered sugar, cherry, toasted oak, caramel

Palate- oak oak oak oak oak. Overpowering, cherry and spicy pepper.

Finish- More oak and spice. Short and viscous

Great nose on this one. The palate fails completely. Tastes like wet wood with a few bright spots here and there. Would have rather had the core 10 year."
