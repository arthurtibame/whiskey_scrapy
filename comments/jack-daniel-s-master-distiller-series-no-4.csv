4.0,"The nose has banana, maple, vanilla, oak and an overall gentle sweetness. The palate is rich and creamy with banana filling the mouth with oak and vanilla following behind it. The finish is medium and slightly mouth warming, with fading banana and sweet oak. The whiskey is rather simple but an excellent sipper and parents itself rather well."

4.25,"Best Jack Daniel's so far. I got a glass of this beauty because a good friend of mine shared it. 

It has the typical Jack Daniel's profile, on the nose is winey, grapy (prunes) but also smoke (charcoal smoke), banana peel, vanilla cream, and an overall note that resembles a mountain forest.

On the palate is hot and spicy, with a hint of toffee, banana. It is full bodied very thick, as syrup. The finish is very long, the longest finish i have ever tasted in a whisky, full of oak and smoke. 

It is a very nice dram, i think it is discontinued due to its limited edition, but you should try it if you hace the chance."

3.75,"On the nose, banana and sweet caramel. Subtle barrel. Flavour is rich and tasty, similar to nose. Medium finish with a gentle warmth remaining for a pleasurable amount of time. 

Enjoyable to sip neat as it evolves in the air over time and gets better as you go. Adding water not recommended. 

Neat at room temperature preferred."
