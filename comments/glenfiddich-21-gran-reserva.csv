Edinburgh) with silhouettes of brown sugar, mocha, and dried maple leaves, some fruit compote. Then it builds a tent on your tongue, with lots of fudge and vanilla inside. But the palate is quite dry and zesty. Lush yet tangy. Like Catherine Zeta-Jones with a whip."

5.0,The last three years of this fine spirit was aged in a rum cask to take on some serious sweetness. I am a huge peat fan and enjoy the peatiest of the peats. So when i took my first sip of this It went down like water. If you enjoy a smooth straight forward scotch with complex sweet flavors but not over powering this is where you need to go.

This beautiful darker gold dram certainly comes in an impressive package. It greets you with a sweet rum embrace. As you drink it, fruits come out, and some oak follows. Ends a little spicy, fairly dry. Didn't find this to go with water at all (just a test for review's sake)."

I'm struggling to get much past sweet rum and vanilla but maybe the indian food we had half way through the tasting has stuffed up my taste buds.

4.0,"Goddamnit, today is just one of those days. This is my second attempt at this note, because I accidentally clicked Cancel instead of Save....

Anyway, let's do this again...Glenfiddich 21. Rum Cask finished. Glenfiddich does tend to provide good stuff througout it's entire lineup. The 21 is no exception, but for the price...well, more on that later. 

On the nose we get a whiff of Rum at first, with a lot of brown sugar and vanilla, followed by some of the Speyside typical caramel and warm, honeyed bananas. After the smell you might expect something very sweet. And you'd be wrong. 

The first sip is bitter and burns. Far more than a 40% ABV Whiskey has any right to burn. That sensation doesn't last long however, and soon opens up burnt sugar, vanilla, caramelized banana notes (not gonna lie, I love any whisky that gives me banana) and a lovely note of dark, bitter wood spices (I mean, 21 years in american oak had to have some impact). 

It finished on the dry, bitter and burny side, with some dried banana chips in there. 

Not even close to the sweetness one would expect, but still rather interesting. Just not worth the 150 bucks when you can get the 18 year old for about 70. I still maintain my opinion that the 18 is the best of the Glenfiddich bunch. So far. 

Well, let's hope that I'm gonna hit that save button this time...cheers."

The Balvenie beats it out easily unfortunately. If this was somewhere from 43-50% ABV, it would do ver nicely, but the 40% just doesn’t have enough for me.

2.5,"During my recent visit to Copper and Oak in NYC, I started the night with the rum finished Blood Oath Pact 5.  The wife was at my side, sampling rums.  I decided to keep the rum theme alive by selecting the Glenfiddich 21 Reserva Rum Cask for my second pour. 

Rum is my second favorite spirit, so rum finished whiskies usually pique my interest.  Unfortunately, I too often find that rum finishes don't add a lot - perhaps some general sweetness, but not much else in terms of additional notes, depth, or complexity.  

Not so with this Glenfiddich.  Short of blending in copious amounts of actual rum, I'm not sure the rum notes could have been any more prominent - tropical fruit and brown sugar most notably.   

Not to be outdone, the underlying whisky is also quite bold, with a typical Glenfiddich profile, but more dry and somewhat bitter on the finish.  It veered towards unappealing. 

But the biggest shortfall is a lack of integration between the malt whisky and the rum notes.  It comes across as a forced marriage.  

This is a complex whiskey that has inspired a very wide range of opinions in the reviews here.  Despite my initial misgivings, I'd be interested in trying it on multiple occasions to see if my reaction varied.  But due to the price, that's not going to happen.  At well over $100, it's far outside of my ""this could possibly get better"" range.

I feel like this whiskey should be a part of Glenfiddich's Experimental Series, even if it's an experiment that didn't quite work (I do usually like Glenfiddich's experimental efforts; the Fire & Cane and XX are both winners).  With a price tag aligned to the rest of the Experimental Series ($40-70), I'd be a lot more forgiving."

Long medium sweet aftertastes with a pleasant long lasting, but mild burn. Second look: there is some pepper on the nose, then raisins. After that identical to the first.  The initial explosion on the back of the pallet makes a guy believe in magic.  But the aftertaste of bitter plums convinces you otherwise. The third sip was as consistent as the first two.  I would totally buy a bottle of this because that explosion on the back is so unique.  Then I would regret buying it after every drink."

This review is about the suprisingly extraordinary Glenfiddich 21, Rum Reserva. It is so delicious that i am considering buying a whole bottle. I am sure that a lot of you guys have tasted it and you might not score it as high as i do, but i am also sure that you have enjoyed this dram.

Bottled at 40%abv. 

On the nose, lets go to the beach and have some fun: Molasses.Rum. Brown sugar. Coffee with sugar, that thick sugar that is left in a cup after drinking the coffee. Oranges, Candy, Sawdust and Chocolate milk. AMAZING.

On the palate, Pineapple pulp. Sugar; Pleasant pepper. Sweet and Incredibly fine in a good way, no overly fancy. Orange peel.

Aftertaste is great. A little dry, Ginger notes, Mouth numbing. Some sweet/saltiness and Acid flavors from tropical fruits.

Overall i score this dram with a well deserved 100 over a 100. If it is complex enough, amazing on the nose, palate and finish; and, you can enjoy it in almost every occasion, that is a perfect score in my book. Well done Glenfiddich, well done. Sláinte!"

Had this as a parting gift from a friend that was moving out of the country.  

Nose: Fruity, complex, inviting and sherried.

Color: close to rose gold

Finish: 9, amazing scotch finish.  Really builds and leaves a smooth, velvety and creamy finish.  Can almost be dessert.  

Score: 10 on a 1-10.  A huge treat."
