5.0,"Bright, with a gentle peatiness that lightens up the whiskey and accentuates the cocoa and fruitiness going on underneath. A great peated American single malt, not trying too hard to follow in Scotch's footsteps with broad-stroke peat and maltiness. It handles these very traditional flavors with nuance and finesse."

All-spice on the nose, then the flavor starts out sweet, and eases into the peat, which never over-powers. I will definitely be buying more of this"

4.0,"I had this evening during a Westland sponsored tasting at Park Ave Liquors.  When you think of peat, you automatically think of the kick in your teeth brute force like Laphroaig or Ardbeg.  This is much milder, just as if it dipped its toe in a wee bit of peat.   it's now over 3 yr old, so probably a tad better than previous versions.  If you're not a fan of peat, or haven't tried it, this is right up your alley.  Subtle enough, but still quite complex.  About $75 w/o tax... so personally I'd not buy it since for $10 more I can get a  Laphroaig Cairdeas.  VFM isn't there for me personally"

4.0,"Drinking Westland Peated American Single Malt is like speaking with a mature teenager. It’s a rare experience and surprises you that such good conversation can come out of something barely grazing the earth’s surface.

Truth be told, this whiskey is vibrant and youthful, so if you’re looking for an armchair dram, look elsewhere. If you’re in the mood for something that doesn’t take itself too seriously while maintaining mature composure and future possibilities, this might be your bag.

The nose pops with sweeter offerings like brown sugar, maple syrup, ripe fruit, subtle peat notes, a hint of vanilla, candied yams, oak, and toasted caramel. The smoke element for me was noticeably lacking. That was a bit of a disappointment, but considering the list of other aromas, I’m being picky.

The palate is probably where this whiskey lacks the most maturity. It’s extremely light. This one is fleeting while offering lovely sweetness and mild peat, almost as an afterthought. Dare I say, this is...refreshing? That would be a first, but yes, it is.

The finish is a dry oak and slight heat.

What Westland is doing here is great. A bit pricey, but really fun. While this simply won’t cut it if you’re looking for a full-bodied, mature, aged outing, it’s lighthearted and captivates in all the right ways.

3.0,Probably 3.5. Would buy. Like American oak but with the peat. I actually liked that the peat cut the sweetness in the American oak.

3.0,"Note: Unbalanced, young. Peat hides the hint of coffee found in their standard whiskey. Has promise but feels like they are trying to copy Islay Scotch more than trying to do their own thing.
Nose: Cereal, toasted nuts, modest peat, smokey without savory
Taste: Sweet, thick and syrupy, modest peat/smokey, dark fruit, cinnamon
Aftertaste: Dry, moderate cinnamon burn. Short finish."

3.0,"Smell the Peat get a smoky aroma very light in color and taste. Well done for an American Scotch. Very simple easy to drink. Would buy it if it were in the $30 price point, but not worth the $70 price tag. Paid $17 for a drink and wasn't impressed at that price point! Luckily didn't know price until after I finished. Would drink Lagavulin 16 over this every time!"

3.0,"Nose: Spicy oaky peat!  A bit of vanilla an light honey sits beneath that nice layer of spicy smoke. A bit of an ethanol burn on the back end.

Palate:  Initially, there's loads of oily sweetness - light, floral honey, soft red apples, and green pears.  The peat arrives as a spicy-sweet smoke, like apples roasted over a campfire.  Nothing medicinal or industrial to this peat, more like that thick white/grey smoke right after you douse a fire that's built up a thick bed of coals.

Finish: Short-medium length and a bit dry.  Pretty boring finish actually.  It's this light heather honey and campfire smoke.

Water turns the nose into something I can only describe as smokey watermelon.  A bit like saltwater taffy.  It feels much thicker and cooler and much of the fruit disappears.  In its place is much more char and smoke, almost tobacco-like, along with a slight charcoal-bitter note.  It lasts a bit longer after some water, but still not long by any means.

Conclusion:  To be honest, I'm a bit disappointed.  The nose is a bit boring and the finish is almost nonexistent besides some residual ambiguous smoke.  It's definitely a tasty peat, not medicinal or industrial, but very campfire smoke-like.  It's tasty, but I don't think it's worth the price."

4.0,"Peat smell is subtle and blended, not overpowering. Body feels a lot thinner than the other two versions, which is too bad. Overall tastes very much like a good quality scotch. A little more richness would have carried the smoke nicely. Still great."
4.0,"I’m in Seattle for a wedding and made it a point to try this whisky. Plan on doing a distillery tour tomorrow but wanted a sneak preview. Makes me excited for the growth of American single malts. 

N- deep dark fruit, vanilla, cereal wheats

T - sweet cherries, pine 

F - peat smoke (earthy like an island scotch not the Islay medicinal), slight spice and brine

It’s a homely winter sweet followed by a gust of peat smoke on the finish. I very much enjoyed it."
3.75,"Peated holds up best to ice, and I’d say wakes up with the cold. Color suffers, but that’s about it. Everything else is as it should be, if anything more sweetness shows up than I previously noticed... all’s well that ends well."

3.5,"Now with my own bottle from the Westland sampler... Peated is smokier and dustier than American Oak but somehow possibly younger feeling? At least, brighter? The smoke is delicate. There’s an astringent quality highlighted in Peated more so than Oak and Sherry... but still, you can’t go wrong with Westland."
