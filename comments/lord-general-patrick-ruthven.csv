4.25,"Nose: spicy rye, bourbony, with hints of grape, cognac and vanilla. Get the bourbon big time, oak. The bourbon barrels definitely overshadow the olorosso. Somewhat reminiscent of the redbreast Lustau.
Body: very full, very spicy. Juicy and mouth watering. Somewhat softer on the end than you’d expect. 
Palate: a fiery explosion at first but then rolls between the bourbon and oloroso. Sometimes cognac, oaky spice, vanilla followed by dark fruit, grape and rich sherry. Half Toboso, half bourbon. 
Finish: a big, long lasting finish. Mouth coating. Artificial Grape flavoring, spice, oak, vanilla. A little dash of salt? I could be mixing that up with spice. 

Like the Redbreast Lustau x 10. Better than I remember."
