4.0,Sweet aroma with hints of honey and caramel. Tad bit of spice. On the palate not as sweet as the smell. Mild caramel remains but sweetness replaced with rye spice and a mild oak flavor. Mild spice on the finish. Good sipper.

4.5,"These are unprecedented times for all of us... It's been 3 weeks of quarenteen and straddling teleconferences with being a part time teacher to my daughters... We should not forget the overnight devistating impact the virus had on our local restaurants and watering holes... For our part the Arizona Whiskey Community has made every effort to promote and support our local businesses buying meals and  and to go Whiskey as often as possible.. After percuring another delivery of Bourbon from one of our local restaurants one of the owners included a sample of this beauty from his personal collection... Let's dive in...

It enters fairly viscous for the proof.... Vanilla and honey dipped cherries lead with oak lingering in the background..milk chocolate and clove hit on the mid palate... The finish is lengthy with vanilla and wood spice... Hint of tobacco... It's just such a lovely Bourbon..

I really enjoyed this Whiskey... For the $40 price when it was released it was a steal .... Nowadays it's way overpriced ... If you can get a pour or sample, definitely do it.... Finally Support Local Please!! National chains will survive but your local shops, bars and restaurants may not...

Cheers All!"
