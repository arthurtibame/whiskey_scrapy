4.5,"Nice, sweet clean drinking bourbon

Nose with chocolate notes

Palette with earthy corn notes.

The wheat in the mash gives a good rounded taste that together with the charred new oak barrels compliment the butcher corn very well.

Believe it is aged around the 2 year mark and barrelled just around 55%

Excellent bourbon and very reasonable priced"
