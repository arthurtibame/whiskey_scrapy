3.0,"Caramel and slight citrus on the nose. Pears, apricot, honey and hint of smoke on the palate. The finish is dry, short and unremarkable."
3.0,"The nose is quite complex with soft and subtle notes of chocolate, and added notes of pineapple and oak. The palate is enjoyable with black tea and spices on the tongue. The finish is a little bitter although balanced with hints of honey and brewed coffee that have some longevity. I like it, but that's about it. It's a whisky that is generic in a way that makes it ultimately forgettable."

4.5,"Very fruity, apple cider on the nose and at the finish. Slight toffee or honey. Surprisingly refreshing. Would be best during hot summer night at the camping site after a whole day of fly fishing"

Smooth, easy to drink"
2.0,"Maybe I’m missing something but I found this to be kind of bland. Yes it’s a little fruity and a creamy finish but other than that I found it to be unremarkable. I was tasting this with other big bold single malts at the time, but still, this one failed to hold its own. Disappointed in this $100+ 18 year old."
