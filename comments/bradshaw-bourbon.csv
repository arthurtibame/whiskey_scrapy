4.0,"Nose is subtle vanilla, color is ok, drinkable, burn is weaker than proof level. Could not find mashbill, but would be surprised if more than 10% rye.  That said, I am a fan of Terry, I thought it was tasty and upon drinking thought of all his NFL funnies.. $39 price point is expensive, should pad his wallet for the longest yard -"

2.75,"Fruity aroma with hints of turf grass. Tastes light with some hint of fruit but could use some extra aging. Solid enough, but not really for $39. Gets worse as the ice ball melts"
