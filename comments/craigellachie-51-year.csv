5.0,"So, I was a lucky winner to sample this rare treat of a scotch.  Furthermore I had the privilege of sharing this experience with a guest which was @PBMichiganWolverine. It was a great pleasure to finally meet you after five or so years of just corresponding through email and Distiller. 

Some background, as we learned from the brand ambassador. This particular scotch was distilled and barreled on 12/22/1962. This, at the time, was all produced on site: Malting, distilling, etc.  There were only two stills in operation.  The barrel was left sitting for 51 years, more so out of experimentation than anything else. Most, if not all, the was used for blends, mainly Old Smuggler (which no longer uses Craigellachie). The whisky, 51 years later, was poured into a glass container to prevent any further angel share loss. This was done mainly out of necessity as the ABV was at 40.8% and with a loss of 2% per year in the Spey region, would had meant reclassification.  Anything below 40% cannot be sold as scotch.  The distillate was poured into a refilled bourbon hogshead casks. This one and only cask was finally unleashed to a lucky few to experience. The sample provided to me (us) was from bottles 6 and 7 of only 51 bottles produced. 

Light in color light amber (what I could determine is the dim setting)

The nose was sweet and tropical fruity, mainly pineapple. A caramel sweetness always hovering and surrounding. A musty note ever present which provided a quality of maturity. As Pranay stated, like musty old library books. 

That musty, earthy quality embodies itself of the palate.  Like damp hay in an old Northeastern barn. Not unpleasant by any means. Lemon polish or lemon oil all within a leather rich, meaty, peppery body. Very well balanced and surprisingly quite lively for an old man.

There is a tingly finish of cinnamon and ginger which ultimately gives was to and oaky, woody dryness that seems to last forever. I think it’s still there. 

A wonderful, mature whisky and a wonderful opportunity.  I will probably never experience anything remotely close to this in age ever.  A great thanks to Craigellachie by sharing this instead of retailing or auctioning. A great whisky. A lucky experience.  Thanks @PBMichiganWolverine Glad I was able to share this opportunity with you. [Tasted: 5/9/19]"
5.0,"Thanks to @Scott_E, i was extremely fortunate to sample a pour of this. Only 150 winners were selected globally, to sample a pour from one of their 51 bottles, single cask.  I was @Scott_E’s guest for this event in NYC.  

For a 51 yr old, it’s astonishing robust.  Nose is all pineapples and warm brown sugar.  But the taste is anything but fruity.  It’s old leather, tobacco leaves, polished wood.  Finish...like being in an old cedar wood library with worn out books.  Something royally elegant.  

I’m not sure I’d ever have a chance to have a single malt this old.  It was truly an experience; not just the whiskey, but the setting as well.  It was in the basement of a darkly lit toasty warm bar, where the ground floor was an elegant restaurant, but a long alley way led to a speakeasy style bar in the basement.  The tasting was private, behind the curtains.  Regal, exclusive.  

Considering they have only 51 bottles from one cask, and only 150 winners, I’m thankful to have the opportunity.  
Thanks again @Scott_E"
5.0,"Emily Ratajkowski rolled down the window of her luxury mercedes while i was waiting for the green lights, standing on the curb.
She smiled at me and offered me a ride home, i accepted.
Upon entering the car, i noticed she was barenaked and a little tipsy. She was holding a bottle of this Craigellachie 51 and pointed it towards me. I dared ask for a Glencairn, but she only had a crystal tumbler. No matter how infuriated that made me, i endeavoured not to let it appear on my face and readily accepted this dram.
As i was about to bring the glass to my lips, she opened her legs and i was sucked into a vortex.
The next thing i remember is hearing my alarm clock and saying to myself it was the last time i get drunk on Ledaig 10..."
