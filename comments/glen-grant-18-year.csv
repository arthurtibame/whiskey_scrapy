4.25,"I’ve been a fan of Jim Murray’s Whisky Bible for a while now, so when he rated Glen Grant 18 “Scotch Whisky of the Year” these last 3 years in a row, I felt it time to give it a try. Additionally, over this same period, he also awarded this spirit two 2nds and a 3rd for his top honor of “World Whisky of the Year.“ Maybe it’s a coincidence, or maybe it’s the product of his refined palate, but over the years many of Mr. Murray’s top selections have become highly collectible, and I often times find myself agreeing with his assessments, similar to what I once recall @cascode stating. The Glen Grant 18 turns out to be a class act. Considering the time spent in ex-bourbon casks, it appears surprisingly light and reminiscent of Chardonnay. One would have to assume these barrels to be treble-filled to impart such a delicate shade of distinction after so much time. Tall, slender stills turn out this expression, so a soft, fruity, and fragrant speyside nose seems befitting for the first pass of the glass. Bottled at 43% ABV, and sporting viscous legs, the whisky rolls over the tongue in smooth and satisfying fashion. Well delineated, flashes of sweet vanilla are mixed with malt and baking spices in such a way that the overall effect seems to vacillate between good scotch and good rye, as its fragile elements pop into and out of existence like photons at the quantum level. Unique and intriguing, I can understand Murray’s fascination with this complex offering as it challenges one’s sensitivities to its various nuances. Every sitting with this whisky seems like a new episode in discovery and I would recommend it with a rating of 4.25 stars."

4.0,excellent and complex profile.. all the subtle notes are there as expected from an 18 yr old
3.75,I’m certainly not a Speyside expert.  Almost salty? Really good scotch but not fantastic...and probably not worth the price. 3.75.

2.0,"Farbe blasses Gelb. Geruch fruchtig, leicht süßlich. Geschmack fruchtige säure, für 19 jahre stark alkoholisch. Abgang kurz  gerösteter Malz, aber Akoholgeschmack bleibt im Mund"
3.0,"A Jim Murray favorite. Fruity on the nose, orchard fruits and melon. The palate is heavy, creamy malt on blast. Slight wood and spice notes follow. 7/29/17"
4.0,"Well crafted and balanced. 

Light on the nose with hints of honey and fragrant fruit. The palate has touches of baking spice and brown sugar with bitter dark chocolate on the finish. 

Quite good."
4.0,"Intense fruit, honey and malt on the nose. Complex and intense fruit on the palate with a soft heat and luscious mouth feel. The age serves this one well. Although I do appreciate the 12 yo at $50, this is a fine step up at $78. A lovely Speysider that should be ranked 89-90 instead of 85 here."

3.25,"This is the whisky Jim Murray rated 2nd  and 3rd best in 2 consecutive years. So does it live up to the hype? No it's not bad but its definately not great. Flat, insipid honey, vanilla with a bitter oakiness which cuts through it and lingers on the aftertaste.  JWB12 beats this hands down at a 1/4 the price. 3.25 for this one."

4.0,Toffee and apples. Very smooth with a long finish. Finished a bottle with some friends over a weekend trip and found this a little too easy too drink. Not as complex and I was expecting. Very friendly. Might be a bit overrated due to Jim Murray’s Scotch of the Year award.
