4.0,"Review for Gibson’s Finest 18 Year Venerable. Dangerously smooth and sweet. Well balanced with soft caramel, oak, floral, and soft spice notes. I assume it’s more robust than the 12 year but it’s so smooth it’s hard to tell. It’s great but for the age and the price I wish it had a bit more oomph to it. The original 18 Year Old Rare has such rave reviews. I wonder if this is really true to that legacy? $90 in Ontario."
