1.0,I’m really disappointed with this. Just pure chemical root beer flavor. It’s only redeeming quality is that it is alcoholic. Maybe it would be okay if it was an ingredient in a more complex drink. But how I drink (2 part drinks) it’s pretty bad. Definitely won’t buy again.

1.0,"Vile. Was on the discount rack at ABC. Paus $10. So sicky sweet and such a chemical root beer flavor, no wonder it was $10. Turns my stomach just thinking about it."

1.0,Chemical root beer taste kills any redeeming bourbon flavor in this bad flavored whiskey. Drank half a shot and dumped the rest out

3.0,SWEET!!! This is good for the ladies & the lite drinkers.  I makes  a great adult root beer float drink. It's probably a good mixer🤔 but I  have not tried that yet.
