2.5,"Color:Medium brown/amber
Nose:Funky,earthy with a hint of chocolate. 
Palate:Chocolate,Coffee and baking spice. 
Finish: a bit hot for a 94 proof whiskey. There is a bit of bitter. So let it breathe and open up for a while. 
This whiskey could’ve benefited from the distillery aging it for couple of years. Perhaps then it wouldn’t be as bitter. 
I would suggest this as a whiskey totry it in a bar if you’re feeling adventurous."
