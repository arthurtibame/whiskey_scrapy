4.5,"Smooth and spicy! Vanilla sweetness melds with orange, pepper, and other savory herbs on the back. It’s complex but not complicated. Warms the soul whilst tantalizing the tongue. A definite buy, especially if you like Irish style whiskies."

3.0,"I love this distillery for their Old Tom Gin. I bought this bottle in Hawaii for an overpriced $95 because I was curious. It's interesting. The first night I tried it I had 3 drams and was quite impressed, although maybe not $95 impressed. After a few more tastings I began to pick up flaws. It's interesting and unlike anything else I've tried, but it's young whiskey that lacks polish and sophistication."
4.5,smooth caramel and vanilla notes with clean finish

5.0,"Batch #2. Great recreation of an Irish whiskey from a creative distillery. Sweet grain smell, little peat or wood. soft smooth grain and fruit on the tongue, creamy mouthfeel, but spice grows. almost floral/vanilla finish that lingers. I've been eaking this one out in small doses over four years, and like it more each time I come back to it. BANG!"

4.0,"Smooth, slightly peaty, nicely spicy but not overly so. Wonderful nose with maple syrup on breakfast barley. Very complex on the tongue but not in a typical way. The French and American oaks are clearly present. The finish is long and smooth. I could drink this every day if I could only find a supply."
