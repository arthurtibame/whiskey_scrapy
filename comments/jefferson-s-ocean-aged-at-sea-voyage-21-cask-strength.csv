4.25,"This is my first go at the ocean going whiskeys.  Cask strength seems to be my sweet spot lately so we shall see where Voyage 21 fits in. Nose is of the seven seas on a mighty pirate ship.... just kidding. Nose is actually quite light to me with mild brown sugar and caramel notes. First sip is a wash of flavor across the palatte. Deep brown sugar and vanilla syrup and a warming cinnamon heat. Also taste some toasted almonds on the edge of the sip. The finish is not overpowering and closes with a touch marzipan. A nice dram to close the day, but not sure it is worth the heavy price tag."

4.25,"Apple and toffee on the nose. Nose smells like apple strudel. Taste is a nice oak char, salt, slight buttered biscuit notes (like the ones at cracker steel), apple and cherry. Finish is very smooth and enjoyable."
4.25,"Nose is toffee, apple, marshmallow, leather, star anise, and cinnamon rolls.

Entry is rich and well-rounded. Palate is smoky, spicy, vanilla, oak char, with some nice cherry and apple notes that light up the bright, lingering finish. Some tannins and oak finally let the whiskey fade into enjoyment. 

Rich and flavorful cask strength from Jefferson's."
