5.0,"This special edition whiskey is a dark rust orange hue with super thin oily legs clinging to the glass.

The nose is fruity with notes of cherry, red grapes, pear, ripe peach, berries and cream, sweet vanilla frosting, Sour Skittles, and a mild note of potpourri/craft store.

The palate is sweet and savory with a watery mouthfeel and notes of red apple, cherry, milk chocolate, salted caramel, and sweet pork chops.

The finish is long, dry, and dusty with a note hinting of cherry pie.

This whiskey is part of 291’s experimental series and it is delicious! It is batch number six, a barrel proof bourbon finished in peach and cherry wine barrels. It’s very fruity obviously while still keeping the standard 291 punch. It’s the best E I’ve had, though they’re all worth trying if you can. Cheers!"
