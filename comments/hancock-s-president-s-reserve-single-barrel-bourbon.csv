4.0,"Don't listen to Gregory [joking] price should Never have anything to do with taste. Hancock Reserve plainly states this is a fruity sided burbon. Coming from the Buffalo Trace family you would think grass,and smoke. But no. This  drink is a pleasant citrus and floral garden of flavor. Let your nose be your guide on this. You will drink what you smell. And in a world where distilleries and distributer  jack the price up for the sake of name recognition  [looking at you Jack,Jim&Johhinne] with [email protected] taste behind it. Little gems like this are a godsend in the sea of detritus swill. But hey everyone's taste buds are different, and no two pallets are the same. I will continue selling this and drinking it [I have had 4 750ml in the past 2 months]. Yummy good."

3.0,"I try not to take price into consideration when rating anything, however it should be noted that If I were, I would knock another star off.  

This whiskey was entirely too fruit forward for my taste.  The flavor profile itself pushed more towards citrus rind and not-so-ripe stone fruit than rich darker fruits that I prefer.

the body of the whiskey is fairly light and the finish lingers, in more of a tannic drying way than in a rich caramel coating.

I found it ""meh"" for the $40 price tag, but it did make for a solid old fashioned"

3.0,"$44.99 @ TW.
This is a good example of a Bourbon that is just, well, nice. Not great, not bad, just nice. 
Upon entry you get vanilla, brown sugar and a hint of caramel. Mid pallette is more of the same with some oak and tobacco on a somewhat short finish. 
At this price it's an ok value. You would typically expect some level of complexity at this price point and sadly you get none of that here. This is certainly the step child of the BT #2 mashbill. It's inferior to every other one."
4.0,"Caramel on the nose, caramel and vanilla taste with a subtle apple finish. Side-by-side to ETL, I can’t really taste a difference. Maybe a slightly thinner mouthfeel and a slightly longer finish. Great substitute for the ever elusive and/or overpriced ETL.

There's a depth and woodiness that one might begin to enjoy followed abruptly by an aggressive green, youthful harshness--in flavor, not so much burn. It is certainly not unpleasant, but it does fall shy of being a standout."

4.0,"K, I'm a little shocked I hadn't heard more about this bourbon before our host at this holiday party poured me a dram.  Compared to the Four Roses I'd sipped just an hour or so earlier, this bourbon is dramatically better, with a nose of fudge, true rich, deep caramel that's missing in a younger bourbon, and some baking spices.  Those flavors, particularly that rich caramel and vanilla, highlight the palate as well, along with some dry cedar and pecan pie.  Hancock's apparently is the same mash bill as Blanton's, Elmer T. Lee, and Rock Hill Farms -- why are those three all incredibly famous, at least among big bourbon fans, while no one talks about this one?  It does finish surprisingly quickly, with the bourbon equivalent of an Irish goodbye, but I would still put this bourbon right up there with Elmer T. Lee.  It has more rich, sweet dessert flavors than that dram, less fruitiness than Rock Hill Farms, and less spiciness and rye than Blanton's.  A very solid bourbon, enjoyed for the first time with first-rate company."

5.0,"Previously, on Hancock’s.

Liquor barn barrel pick. Yada yada yada.

Hard to say what to make of the barrel pick concept when comparing to a generic single barrel. Because every barrel is a barrel pick, right?

Whoever chose this particular barrel did a better job than Liquor Barn. And I don’t mean that as a knock on LB, because I liked that pick. But I freakin love this one. Everything that I like in the LB pick is magnified here. When I go back and forth (again, for science), the Liquor Barn barrel pick is bland. On this guy I get immense green apple on the nose. It’s awesome. Body is a quick hit of tart green apple, carrying though on the finish with an additional bit of citrus zest. Phenomenal.

I will say that this one has a heavier burn on the backend, making the LB pick smoother. However, I’d trade that smoothness all day long for the flavor punch that this dram brings."

5.0,"Thanks to Liquor Barn for this barrel pick. I haven’t had the standard yet, but after this pick, I look forward to it.

The overall thesis statement for this bourbon is its ease to drink. Low astringency on the nose, oily mouth feel on the body, and next to no heat on the finish. It’s a very smooth bourbon.

There’s a bit of caramel on the nose. This transitions into a caramel apple body, and the tart really kicks in on the finish for true, sour green apple. I’ve had sweet apple and green apple, but never in the same drink before. Very interesting, and one of my favorites."
3.75,Apple blantons
4.0,The nose is the best part. Sweet apple wafted up when I opened the bottle. Reminiscent of an apple jolly rancher. End of the nose reminds me of my favorite blend of pipe tobacco. Sweetness continues onto the palate. Finished with a little burn but didn’t last long enough. Thin mouthfeel. Favorite part was the nose.

nose isn't as soft and caught me off guard but the flavor is nice. I see it compared to Blanton's and maybe that's because it's a single barrel product but they're pretty different IMO.

I would give the edge to Blantons but if you like spice and cinnamon, this has that but just not something I've come to expect in my bourbons."

The bad: somewhat muted, short-to-medium length finish, not complex or deep in flavor profile.

Verdict:  A nice sipper hence the rating, and what’s here is presented really well. If this was $30 I would buy it all day, but just not deep or layered enough to justify a rebuy at $50."
3.75,"Liquor Barn pick.

Really enjoying this so far. Not the most complex bourbon I’ve ever had but there’s a lot to like about it. If you’re able to find it, it’s definitely worth picking up as an every day sipper."
4.25,Similar profile to Stag Jr and Blantons. If you can get this for regular price it’s a very good bourbon. Definitely not a >$50 a bottle bourbon though.
3.75,"This is a very easy sipper that you don’t have to think much about. Think: Blanton’s but brighter 

Nose: hints of cherries, butterscotch, raisins

Palate: baking spices as the rye comes in a bit on the palate as opposed to the nose 

Finish: pleasant and soft. Slight warmth, with hints of citrus, almonds and baking spices 

It’s a like spicier Buffalo Trace at almost the same proof."
4.25,"So good, has the spicy fruit nose and taste of a rye without the rough licorice. One of the best high rye bourbons I've had. I wish they offered this in NC. I picked it up in Kentucky for roughly $30 or $35 and have never seen it on the shelf here, so I have to make it last!"

3.75,"Liquor Barn (KY) store pick (2018)

Nose: similar to Blanton’s as it shares the same mash bill at Buffalo Trace. A little more toasted oak up front though. Sort of like a blend of Blanton’s and McKenna 10 from Heaven Hill because of some toasted nutty notes. Vanilla is there as well. 

Palate: more spicy vanilla and slight butterscotch. Sweeter than Blanton’s but considering the 15% rye in the mash it’s not that spicy at all. 

Finish: short and sweet. Not much bite. 

Kind of a muted, sweeter Blanton’s/ETL. Will have to come back to it. Doesn’t rise to that level though as Blanton’s is a four-star pour for me."

3.0,"Glenacairn, no water, bottle less than 3 months old.  Nose is sweet and hot at the same time, with a surprising amount of corn. Time and judicious distance reveal caramel and a tinge of menthol, almost like someone opened a tube of Tiger Balm in the next room over.  Palate is heat forward, with a burst of cinnamon followed by the briefest flash of caramel and vanilla, then more cinnamon heading to a pronounced drying.  Finish is short and woody.  I enjoy Blanton's, and Elmer T. Lee is a personal favorite.  I can find the resemblance, but it's faint, like you can see how a VW Beetle is related to a  Porsche 911...some of the curves are there, but they're not really developed yet, and performance is drastically different.  Same goes here; this isn't bad bourbon, but it's also nothing to write home about."

3.75,"I’ve been looking for this bottle for a while with no luck, and then I found one. I wanted to compare it to Blanton’s (same mash bill, also a single barrel and very similar proof).

The nose has bright fruit (green apple), baking spices, brown sugar and leather. (Blanton’s is more baking spice forward. It has some apple, but not as much as Hancock’s. In general Blanton’s is slightly subdued overall compared to Hancock’s).

The palate has the same thing as the nose with maybe a hint more of rye spice. Very balanced from nose to palate with some sweetness. (Blanton’s still has more spices in the palate)

The finish is on the shorter side of medium with dampened notes of baking spices and fruit. (Blanton’s had a longer finish with more of a burn, a good burn) 

Overall, I think I like this more than Blanton’s, which surprised me. Even with the slightly less proof, Hancock’s stood on its own and had bolder flavors. Blanton’s is nice, but maybe a little too gentle and subtle with what’s going on flavor wise, though it has a better finish.
I can see why some people think Hancock’s is a more watered down (weaker punch) Blanton’s, but I think flavors Hancock’s offers are more interesting.
As a reminder, these are both single barrels, so your results may vary."
