4.0,"What I love about this whiskey is that it doesn't try to be a Yamazaki single malt.  I tend to associate the Yamazaki varieties with flavors and smells of autumn - bold, aged overripe fruits combined with oak and spices frequently enjoyed during that time of year.  Not the Hibiki 17.  The Hibiki is distinctly from another season altogether.  Honey.  Flowers.  A younger, lighter, greener fruit and wood.  Please don't consider this distinction to be a detriment.  The flavors are orchestrated evenly and gracefully so that the overall experience is as enriching and enjoyable as a walk through a blossoming orchard on a late April afternoon."

""Sound"" greets you with fruit fruit fruit, then goes in as honey and nuts. A little water enhances the fresh oak essence. It finishes smooth and sweet; you can almost imagine this bowing to you. It's just an immensely enjoyable blend. Don't bother with this in a highball. It doesn't hold up to THAT much water. Glad this is finally in the US... much cheaper in Japan, though."

5.0,"Nose - Like it's younger sibling, has a very floral nose. Honeyed green fruits like green apple and Bartlett pears. Hints of lychee and longan. Faint hint of lightly toasted sweet brioche.
Taste - Slightly thin mouthfeel, but it's very fruity and crisp. Like the nose, it is like warm honey drizzled over warm pears or green apples. Slight bitterness like that you'd get from the skins of an green apple. Like a lightly oaked pear cider that has a few of those green Japanese plums in it.
Finish - Finishes great in that it's a medium long to long finish that is a like a dry pear cider. You get a bit of lingering bitterness like if you've ever eaten one of those small Japanese green plums in that it's sweet, but slightly bitter, almost like citrus pith, but quite refreshing.

5.0,"Hands down one of the top three blends I've ever had.  This is incredibly smooth and complex.  Nose is floral, like honeysuckles and lillies.  I can smell this all day.  Really a more floral aroma than the 12, and even the 21.  21 might have more depth and complexity, but this certainly beats it hands down on the floral aroma.  Taste is strangely a bit salty and nutty.  I had it with a small round ice, I didn't get chocolate but I did get caramel.  Ironically, I feel as if I'm having a Scottish Highlander on the palette and a Lowlander on the nose.  Not getting a classic eastern taste.  Either way, it's really good.  Thanks to Davie for the sample!"

5.0,"Really rich, and THAT mizunara taste, wonderful"
5.0,"What a beautiful decanter styled bottle, the cork is mounted in a glass knob... Nose is delightfully rich, full and complex, opening with intense rum raisin and creamy bourbon-oak vanilla atop a seam of caramel. The rest is just mysterious and ephemeral enough, I can't describe it without using silly subjective Pigeon-English, so I'll spare you, savvy? Palate follows suit with tart fresh pineapple and exotic spices, hint of salt, soft floral mint and just a touch of bubblegum fruitiness, but in a good way. Medium finish with spicy/zesty kiwi-like astringency, so unusual yet satisfying. Not only does this dram like a long while in the glass to open up, but the bottle improved noticeably after about 4 months. A special gift from my mother, a whisky drinking wanderlust world traveler, with a son who didn't fall far from the tree. Dry glass: buttery malt, hint of juniper."

5.0,"i bought my first bottle of this three years ago.  since then, it has doubled in price on the australian market.  this is a wondrous drink - a sipping blend if ever i found one.  complex yet balanced - possibly the most balanced whiskey i have ever tried and sublimely subtle in its complexity.  its floral notes are not cloying, its minor smokiness is a welcome offering, the influence of multiple woodings marry well in the blend.  i've drunk half a bottle of this - i'm rationing the rest of it given the jump in japanese whiskey prices recently as i am loathe to run out of this fantastic drink and loathe to pay A$300 a bottle to replenish this wonderful expression."

The aroma of Hibiki 17 is elegant, complex and floral with exotic spices, green plums and notes of old wood and leather. Distant charcoal, honeycomb and hints of tobacco round off the nose. Bold, intense oak flavors dominate the taste, taking turns with plum sourness, sweet nectarines and fresh mint. Although a little weak in its savory-dry 'matcha green tea finish', it still is a skillfully blended, adorable Japanese dram.

5.0,"Today is a special day. Last night my parents are at home before leaving for their 6-8 weeks trip to sweden with their RV. Gonna miss them (and the doggo), and since I usually share my samples with my dad, I decided to break out the good stuff today. 

Hibiki 17, the juice that went from hilariously overpriced to ""sold for the low low price of your firstborn son"". Still bloody worth it. 

This has to be my favorite whisky so far. On the nose it starts with a malty fudge, roasted brown sugar (almost a bit rum like), herbal notes that give it a certain freshness and a distant note of stewed apples. Simply delicious. 

The taste is just amazing. Ripe bananas, caramelized in brown sugar, roasted almonds with basil, rich, dark chocolate and salty cocao for some extra spice. I first had this in an irish pub, along with some ribs and drumsticks while there was some metal in the background, and for the first few sips, everything around me was gone. Granted, it was a bit milder back then because the bottle was almost empty, but still, I get the same notes in this sample. With a glas of this you can sit back in a chair and when you're done, about an hour is gone and you don't remember anything except the pleasure of this dram. 

The aftertaste is long and sweet, dark, rich and just delicious. 

Currently the 17 is between 500 and 800€ a bottle, while the 21 starts at 550€. I don't need to say that these prices are bullshit. But, if you can efford it, or if you can at least get a sample somewhere, this is one of the few whiskys that you have to try at least once in your life."

4.0,Very approachable. Reminded me of white peaches.
5.0,"I don’t normally give 5 stars, but this Hibiki 17 is really great! Recently I had the Hibiki 21 at a Japanese whisky tasting and it was good, but it was a little too old for my liking. The 17 year is probably the sweet spit for age. Smooth rich and an amazing velvety mouth feel. I don’t know if the price will ever go down enough to warrant me spending big bucks on a bottle, but I’ll still put it in my wishlist anyways!"

5.0,"Is this the best dram i have drank on 2018?, so far it is. Let me start saying that i had this sample for a long time waiting for a special time and i have decided that my whisky No. 300 is going to be the world's famous Hibiki 21yo, but i cant have that one without going on the 17yo first, so this, my whisky No. 299 is the also world's famous Hibiki 17yo. Easily one of the best blended whiskies i have ever had.

Bottled at 43%abv, deep gold color.

Lets start with its main feature: it is super complex.

On the nose, smells wonderful: Dark dried cake, wedding cake, Red fruits, very Winey, Berries; Impalpable sugar, cake custard cream. Wonderfully complex so sweet, Must have been seasoned in sherry casks due to its profile on the nose. After some minutes, red apple juice and Creme brulee. The empty glencairn leaves notes of Sweet Quince (in Ecuador we call it membrillo dulce, google it) and blackberry jam. It is a dessert. 

On the palate it is imperative to have the more quantity of sips as possible since it changes and changes with every sip. First sip (without having anything to eat or drink in a couple hours) (yes, i prepared myself for this) which is suppossed to be harsher than the rest of the sips, is Hot, Spicy, Oaky, Sugary but exceptionally smooth. The rest of the sips is where everything goes wild. Orange, Caramel, Cough syrup.
For a hot/oaky dram it is very pleasant. Super delicious sensation, Ashes are also there, Hints of smoke, Hints of brown sugar; Mostly oaky but very refined. Bitter sherry, Almonds and also pepper. Incredibly complex as you can see.

Aftertaste has a ginger mixed with sugar syrup note, finish is very very long, mouth-full,  powerful but very lovely. Mouth watering. Spicy delight behind teeth.

You wish this was food. You wish you could eat this dram rather to drink it. It is simply amazing. Overall, 100 over 100 is the only score i can give it, having a 25/25 on the nose, palate, finish and balance. KANPAI! (slaintè in japanese)"

3.5,"Nose- light and soft, butterscotch, pineapple, raisins, toffee, floral

Palate- honey, ginger, pear, apple cider, touch of mizanura oak

Finish- Medium, thin finish with notes of sweet honey and an apple/pear cider

This is just an average whisky. I would be infuriated if I spent $400 on this. The difference between the 17 and 21 is astounding."
