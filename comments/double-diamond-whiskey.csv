5.0,"I don't like many whiskeys. I use Wild Turkey in my plantation cake. This is the only other whiskey I use because I like it's taste. It is especially great in sours. I think it is the rye because I also love rye beer. However, it has a great sipping taste.  I do drink other liqueurs straight esp top shelf scotches."
