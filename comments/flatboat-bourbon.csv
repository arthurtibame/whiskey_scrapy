2.0,Your basic bourbon with a little spice finish and light oak. I use it for Bourbon Bloody Mary’s.

2.0,"Nose is bready and vanilla, palate is more of the same and finish is a little sharp and warm. Nothing too crazy happening here, more of a good old fashioned bourbon vs a slow sipper"

3.0,"A little smoother than the 1792 small batch I have, with a little less spice up front. A smoother sipper than its small batch counterpart in my opinion."

3.0,"A good bourbon with some Rye spice. I am not sure what the mashbill is here, but I found the nose light and floral and the favour to be layered with nice spice. A bit young and not too much oak, but an enjoyable drink."
