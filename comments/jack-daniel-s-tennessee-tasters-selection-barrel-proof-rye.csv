3.0,"This special Tennessee rye has a dark copper color and thin watery legs.

The nose is sweet and full, rich with notes of caramel apple, vanilla frosting, orange soda, robust maple syrup, syrupy cherry, overripe peach, dill, and black licorice. With a splash of water more floral and grassy notes rise up.

The palate is punchy with notes of char, orchard fruit, dill pickle, spice cabinet herbs, graham crackers, and rye and barrel spice. With that splash of water a note of watermelon candy comes out as well as turning down the heat.

The finish is like a trek through the desert: long, hot, and dry.

This interpretation of Jack Daniel’s rye whiskey is good but it’s harsh too. Taking it down to a lower proof was a good move and I respect it. I’m glad I got to try it right out of the barrel, but I acknowledge some whiskeys are better when proofed down. Thanks Jack! Cheers!"
