2.0,Mediocre bourbon/rye taste. Nothing special. A little raw and overly sweet. $60 in Ontario.

5.0,"Slightly fruity, sugary nose with hints of maple and vanilla. The palate is well balanced with a tart caramel apple, late spice kick and an herbal backbone. Other notes of sweet vanilla birthday cake, anise, and baking spice rounds out the palate. The finish is the draw of this bottle lingering on the the tongue and in the gums and cheeks with a sweet heat and mellow campfire undertone."

5.0,"Unique among 40 Creek whiskies.  Stronger cereal notes.  The Bourban comes through nicely from them barrels they get from down south.  Very interesting and enjoyable.

Edit:  it’s got some breadiness to it which I love... yeast notes."

4.0,Not very strong on the nose but filled with a strong pecan/vanilla finish.
4.0,"From the first sip you get the spice, very much like a habanero bite and i get it all over the tongue and throat. Second sip really get all types of notes i get some wood, a little floral, but none the less a smooth finish. This would be great with steak."

3.25,"While being approachable, sweet with a hint of spice, this whisky suffers from its lower proof. Ultimately I was hoping for slightly more flavour from the bourbon cask. Still pretty good."
