2.0,Too sweet
5.0,This is a very nice drinking whiskey The hint of caramel really comes out.  Being a light whiskey its less full bodied than the typical whiskey and thats fine with me. I enjoy this in an Old Fashioned or Sour.  An added bonus is the unique labeling.
2.0,"Really flat profile. You could call it ""Corn Squeezin's"" and be done with it. For some strange reason, I keep coming back to it. It's almost like moonshine light. That corn sweetness and about half the heat of a corn mash moonshine. It's actually quite good mixed with black iced tea and cranberry juice on ice. I think it's a good experimental whiskey for mixing what would normally be high-octane drinks. Not one that I want to drink straight and assign a profile to though....."
