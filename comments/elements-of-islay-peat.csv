3.0,"Another installment in my gift collection of samples. As the description states, this whisky is sourced from Islay malts to showcase their character. Seeing that this has an ABV approaching 60, I added about 1/2 tsp of water to the 30 mL dram and gave it 15 minutes to open up. 

Nose:  Iodine, sea spray, smoke, citrus zest
Palate: Honey, smoked ham (very prominent), cigar ash, campfire, and ethanol burn
Finish: medium long and hot with lingering smoked ham. 

3.5 stars. Not bad for something I've never heard anything about."

ピート感強いが、クセになる香り。アタックが強烈だが、その後にマイルド感漂う。"

4.0,"Good whisky, and reminiscent of a Lagavulin 16. Peat and honey play nice here, with a smooth finish. I recommend."

null,Tasted the CL8. Quite a sweet peaty flavour so not too bad.
5.0,"strong, peaty, full flavour. With big peat christmas edition this is a good cask strength islay blend."
