5.0,"Glenfarclas tasting night at The Oak Barrel, Sydney, 4 July 2019. Whisky #6

Nose: Delicious fruity and cereal aromas melded with subtle sherry. Toasted muesli, honeysuckle, Jersey caramels, fresh brioche, a bouquet of spring flowers (!), toasted almonds, vanilla cupcakes, orange water, raisins, dates, glace cherries, sultanas, dried figs, a soft sweet sherry note, gold rum and some dusky exotic spices. There is a reserved oaky presence, more like a beeswax-polished oak dresser than a whisky cask, or maybe like a whiff of sandalwood incense, and absolutely no trace of obvious alcohol. Nosing this was like smelling my grandmother’s kitchen when she was baking Christmas cake (remember, Christmas is in the middle of summer in Australia).

Palate: Sweet, rich, honeyed and nutty arrival.  The development shows orchard and tropical fruits, crème fraiche drizzled with leatherwood honey, cinnamon and mild ginger powder, mint, cooked oatmeal, toasted sesame seeds and butter. Adding water expands this dram in the most astonishing way by unleashing a reservoir of unusual spicy notes. It gains fragrant flowers and Keemun tea, allspice, tumeric, orange marmalade, fennel and caraway seed along with fig jam and quince paste. The texture is initially creamy but with water becomes viscous and oily.

Finish: Long. The enormous complexity of the palate subsides into a multi-faceted savory-sweet aftertaste.

An excellent whisky that has the bold presentation and sweet character of the regular 105, but is less focused on intense dark aromas and flavours, instead showcasing light cereal and fruit characteristics.

The palate is very complex and large, with an almost indefinable “strong subtlety” of profile. Imagine the regular 105 toned down, matured and gentled over long years, with the strong spice and tannic notes resolving into mild seasonings. The cask presence in this whisky is excellent, having a touch of sandalwood about it that suits the subtle spices perfectly.

Most surprisingly, alcohol is almost undetectable in this dram, on either the nose or palate. This truly is a cask-strength whisky that can be enjoyed neat without any burn at all, but that said I would strongly encourage taking it with a good dash of water, as this transforms the palate into something quite sublime.

Describing this as a cross between the 105 and 25 year old expressions would be an over-simplification and not quite accurate … but not completely inaccurate either. It’s an outstanding whisky, and highly recommended if you can find it. I would have bought a bottle on the night but sadly stocks were very limited and I wasn’t fast enough.

“Outstanding” : 5 stars"
