null,"At the beginning of the journey you taste spice and heat. Yet the ""old holt"" sends you for a ride that you are yet to experience. The beauty and passion that flows through this american rye is exceptional.  I could care less if you are paul revere or Vanna white, this whiskey makes you want to hold your loved ones close and embrace your hated enemies.  Appreciate old overholt for the reliable friend it has been to me and hopefully the companion it promises to be to you."

3.0,"Nose: Stingy and sour rye develops into sweet, sugary rye. Hints of corn and fruity notes.

Taste: Rough and bitter rye with spices. Gets smoother and sweeter with time. Turns into gingery rye.

Finish: Like sour and mildly spicy rye bread. Pepper rises nicely very late in the aftertaste.

Balance: Harsh at first but when given time, this straight rye whiskey becomes decent."

I wasn't disappointed but I wasn't blown away feeling as if II got some super great deal. It has a unique flavor, and is definitely a RYE, but I bought it thinking it would make a GREAT manhattan and it didn't. The taste was almost too unique to make it feel like it could be an everyday cocktail base."

The palate, too, is a just a little too tame - spice, banana bread, a little vanilla. Pleasant enough, but something I prefer in a Manhattan, Sazerac, or Old Fashioned instead of on its own...and even then, a more flavorful rye would probably take you farther, too."

It makes for excellent Manhattans and even better Godfathers (we also make a house variant with 3 parts Old Overholt to 1 part each of Cointreau and amaretto, which is best with the spiciness and edge of this rye)."

Tasting notes seem futile, given that this is something tailor-made to be consumed in shot form. But there's legitimate *flavour* here--sweetness, nuttiness, some herbal character and baking spice. And these, combined, make it a pleasant sip. I would not seek this out for its complexity, or for its character in cocktails (ABV is too low), but as a beer + back combo, it is--frankly--superb."

2.0,2 - 2.5 ⭐️. Couldn’t quite bring myself to give it a 3. So so for a straight rye whiskey. Nose and palate a bit on the ethanol side. Slight bite in mid-palate and finish. Definitely came across like a bottom shelf bargain Rye but I’ve had better for about same price point (enter Ezra Brooks Rye [Green label] & Rittenhouse Rye). Maybe my expectations were set too high 😊

Palate is sweet bananas foster, mild rye and oak. Its not deep or robust but pleasant. Doesn't have the dill note of the MGP 95% ryes which is a plus for many. Finish is drying oaky spice with soft vanilla. It tastes young with some rye sizzle and light flavor. Still , I think this is a great value at $15-20ish. I prefer bolder more flavorful rye but if you're looking to try out rye or want a mixer this is an easy choice......78/100.............good enough to drink neat but not a heavy hitter."
