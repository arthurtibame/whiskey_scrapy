5.0,"As a wise man once said, ""If perfection on the palate exists, this is it.""  

It is hard to find something else to say.  This complex and delicate dram will blow you away with its boldness and finesse.  Strong peaty nose turns somersaults of salt, caramel, and that hint of tar before the long glorious ride into the sunset.

I literally shed a tear with the knowledge that I may never see another bottle. If you finds one, cherish it."
