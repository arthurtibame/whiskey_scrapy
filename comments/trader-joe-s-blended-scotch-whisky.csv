3.0,"It’s hard to argue the bang for buck factor here. This has a unique ‘funk’ I’ve picked up in several of TJ’s scotches, but it’s not unpleasant. I usually pick up a couple of these when I’m up in WA. $11 for a full liter ($17 after the state sticks it in without lube)  is hard to beat for a basic blend that’ll make a solid scotch n soda everytime. I like it on the rocks or even neat."
