3.0,"On the nose, spicy, sweet and fruity. Notes of cloves, fresh grinded pepper, toffee, apples, raspberry, and a light background of wood. The taste is fresh and very spicy, with a light body. The finish is medium and pleasant, with wood and fruits. A pleasant easy going whisky"

4.0,"Nose - Pleasant nose, notes of stewed apples and prunes, hint of chocolate, hint of ginger spice.

Taste - Toasted apple cider, slightly metallic prune/dark raisin syrupy sweet, ginger spice, white pepper heat, burnt orange rind fruity bittersweet, burst of golden raisin sweet at the end.

Finish - Lingering light metallic bitter apple/grape juice sweet, ginger spice stays, white pepper heat lingers.

Score - 84/100

Final Thoughts - I quite enjoyed this. I was a bit skeptical at the odd 42.8% abv but the nose was quite pleasant and the flavors punched way above the proof. Flavors were pretty balanced between light and fruity with a dark and bold sweet, but what threw things off a bit was the metallic taste I got. A tiny bit distracting as it shows up mid palate and then lingers to the finish. I think if the metallic notes weren't present, this would get significantly higher marks as it kind of throws it off like it's been sitting and forgotten inside a metal flask for months only to be discovered and tasted later."

3.75,"Interesting..after Port Askaig 16 peated I tried this and got inner rubber bike tube on the nose and then liquid honey on the first taste. Then currants, raisins, xmas pudding fruits, toffee, orange rind, ginger and more. Very,  nice. The burnt caramel ethanolly bitterness builds at the end unfortunately like most macallans I've tried which brings it down a peg. I don't seem to notice it at the beginning but towards the end of the dram its more noticeable, again like a number of macallans I've tried. Without this it'd be 4.25 easy with brings down to 3.5 to 3.75 territory. I wouldn't buy a bottle but quality dram if a bit highly priced at $120 USD here."
5.0,"Orange, plum, all spice, vanilla,sherried, mocha chocolate in the.nose. The taste is a short spicy kick, ginger.kick with a superb coffee grounds flavour, all spices. In finish i find wine tanins with a bitter-dark chocolate, and a a shy mint note. What a wunderfull surprize!"

5.0,"Tried this with a bunch of 1/2 oz pours at a friend’s. A lovely chocolate, floral, berry taste to contrast with the deep dark rich Macallan Rare Cask flavors. Might like it as much or more than Rare Cask"

3.75,"This one i believe is intended for the travel Retail Market. 

Bottled at 42.8%abv, with a beautiful Russetmusscat color. (Or just red if you like, lol)

On the nose main notes i found were: Cherry Cola, Tobacco leaf, almonds and grapes. 

On the palate it was oaky hot, a little citrus and a little bitter too, with pepper, liquorice , caramelized apples and spent fireworks (like ashes) notes. 

The aftertaste is hot but in a good, bearable way. Medium finish, medium body as well.

Overall this Macallan has a 79 out of a 100 for me, but it is a tricky score because it felt like more, but my rating gave me this: 19 on the nose, 21 on the palate, 19 finish and  20 in balance. Cheers."

4.25,"Very nice. good spices that balance well with the little bit of heat still in the spirit. not a bad expression. kind of a ""Macallan Prime"" it's what you expect from Macallan just a little lighter."
4.25,"Toffee, cloves, and orange on the nose. Caramel and toffee in the body, with a ton of pineapple and orange. Finishes looooong with a nice oily texture coating the tonight work burnt sugar and chocolate."
