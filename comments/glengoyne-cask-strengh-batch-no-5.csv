3.75,"Nose: 3,75* White pepper, baked bananas, honey corned flakes, milk chocolate and raisins.

Palate: 3,75* Ashy white pepper turns to honey-ed malt, bitter chocolate.

Finish: 4* More subtle pepper now, ashes, pretty long and kind of waxy.

Peppery is part of it’s character and best embraced. Serve with a small amount of water, too much really drowns out any flavours."
