2.0,"Batch #3. Interesting and pleasant nose... some glue, some sour orchard fruit, clove honey, holiday spice. After a few minutes, the walnuts show up. On the palate, a somewhat creamy mouthfeel, with a bitter herbal note, and then the nocino influence. Ends with some sweetness and bitter nut shells. Warmth isn't intense but it lingers. It's not bad, but you're left wishing this was deeper and more complex. 8/1/18"
