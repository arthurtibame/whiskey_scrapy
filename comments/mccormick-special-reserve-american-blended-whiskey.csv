2.25,"Appearance: Alright, so this American blended whiskey’s color was a “russet muscat” darker caramel. The legs here were medium sized but the wateriest I had ever seen.

Nose: The nose was not too complex; notes of caramel, oak, vanilla, Smarties candy, and strangely enough a note of Buddig turkey lunchmeat. After adding a splash of water there was a light nutty tobacco note as well.

Taste: The palate was also uncomplicated with discernible notes of sweet corn, caramel, and cherry candy. After adding a splash of water it got even more boring and had the essence of lukewarm almond milk.

Finish: The finish had surprisingly no burn, but it was quite short and anticlimactic.

Thoughts: If I hadn’t know what this was, beforehand, I would have believed it was a bourbon. It's not a whiskey worth having a fan club or even a T-shirt, but it was better than I was expecting. It was decent neat, and good in a hot toddy as well! Thanks McCormick Distilling! Cheers!"
