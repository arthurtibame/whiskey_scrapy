More fruit flavors on the taste, berries and cream.  Gives ways to a punch of spice.  Cinnamon, pepper.  Lingers with a nice long finish.  Either this opened up or my taste gravitated towards this, but I am adoring this at the moment."

4.5,"Wow, for 110 proof you only get one quick punch of alcohol. This is a fantastic creamy tasting bourbon with a subtle nose that is less harsh than others I've had between 100-120 proof. It is a little pricy but I highly recommend for a special occasion. I was originally going to get something like Baker's or a name brand cask strength, and I'm so glad I went with this instead. At 110 proof this is basically a cask strength anyways since most are between 110-130 proof. I'm anxious to try Rare Breed next and compare the two.

Update - I've had this open for nearly 2 months and it has mellowed out. The nose is really soft now, but it is so drinkable. If I didn't know the proof I'd say it was 95-100. I barely get any alcohol burn even with swishing around my mouth. This is a fantastic bourbon."

Gordon’s private barrel store pick 
Bottled May 2018
Color is deep amber. Nose is fairly weak but complex, with faint vanilla, caramel, bubble gum and cinnamon apple pie. Velvety mouth feel. Palate is well balanced, with cinnamon and clove with hints of vanilla. Finish also a bit weak, lingering oak with subtle spice but without much character or depth. Some alcohol burn in the mouth, but not much of a hug. I do like this one as a daily sipper, but disappointing for the price and reputation."

I enjoyed this quite a bit.  It checks just about all of the boxes.  It blends sweetness and spice together very well.  It packs heavy doses of maple and toffee.

2.0,"I picked up a barrel pick for the Triad Municipal ABC board (NC) about a month ago. Tried it neat and it was hot. The ethanol and spice flushed out any other flavors. Tried it a few more times and got the same experience. Tried it with a little water and it did cut the spice but the other traditional bourbon flavors are still masked by the spice. I’m a huge fan of barrel proof / high proof bourbons, but this doesn’t hold a candle to Blanton’s SFTB, Woodford Batch Proof or Elijah Craig Barrel Proof or Weller 107. Do not agree at all with the 95 score this has, but to each his own. I’ll save this for nights when I cheat on keto and decide to drink an old fashion."

P: very woody - fresh oak, and walnuts, dark chocolate and cinnamon mid palate with hints of mint throughout.

F: hotter than expected, but bitter chocolate and wood notes linger with pepper flavors that last a loooooooong time. This one lingers!

The palate has a few things going on and takes a minute to separate the flavors. There isn’t one that pokes out over the others really.
I get some leather, oak, and dark fruit. Not really that sweet. 

The finish is the short side of long. No burn really. Just a slight minty aftertaste.

55%rickhouse CNF and Floor 641.  Good info and I know the turkey fans will know just which rickhouse that is and will even know which notes they'd expect from me.  For me, I'm a bit disappointed we don't get age detail.

Nose - So there's a hair of wood funk to go with our traditional bourbon notes of oak, caramel, and vanilla.  I get a touch of finger nail polish remover.  I get a touch of cherry.  There's a lot of alcohol on here, far more than 55% should indicate.  Overall a nice pleasant all bit it a bit alcohol forward nose.  Not overly complex but not boring.  I like the cherry note on the finish and that bit of oak funk it a nice switch up.

Taste - Not a nice way to start this but it's hot on the tongue, really overly alcohol, rare breads don't have this much alcohol for me.  So get some of the fruity cherry note but it gets hit with some off note as a swallow, it's some bad oak and just crazy astringent, it's bitter, and wow the finish is just an alcohol burnt mouth.  Water certainly does help, it brings in some nutty character but it doesn't mask the off notes, it does curb the alcohol.  Yeah bitter oak and it's really keeping me from even getting into the nice bourbon notes under it.  

I'm really disappointed in this bottle.  There's just no shaking that it's not good whisky.  Hopefully, I'll get to try a better bottle and I'll put a new review up.  For now I'm going with 0.5 as the nose is actually nice enough and I enjoy smelling it."

The nose makes me think wood burning fireplace meets boozy, zesty fruitcake with toasted nuts and dried fruit.  The nose is rich and warming, like steam coming off of maple syrup and pancakes.

This is smooth as can be on the front with burn on the back that relaxes to a long, playful finish.  There is a lot of sweet vanilla up front and cinnamon and nutmeg in the back with oak and orange peel.  

Every step is an experience that transports me to a crisp fall day.  Somehow I’m warm on the inside with a mouth and nose bursting with excitement that rolls from one flavor to the next and back again.

4.25,"I reviewed a pick from a different store a few months ago. This one is from Main Street Liquors in Nashville, TN.

The nose has cherry and apple fruit noses along with baking spices, rye, barrel char, leather and a hint of peanuts.

The palate has a medium body and is nice and spicy with rye and other baking spices, peanut dust and some subtle cooked fruit.

The finish is also spicy with some tingling in the back sides of the tongue and middle of the throat. I gets some nutty notes as the finish fades.

I like this pick. Compared to the other store pick I have, this one is spicier. Russel’s Reserve Single Barrels are very good, especially if you can snag a store pick."

Age: 9 years, 11 months
Nose: oh sweet nectar of the gods...nutmeg, allspice, caramel, vanilla 
Palate: Syrupy...the spice blends in perfectly with a cherry cordial cola thing. Oily af, and mouthcoating. Tingles the front of the tongue and gives way to the perfect hug. Goes on for a minute or two.
Finish: just alluded to that...the perfect finish. All of the flavors come together like the second side of Abbey Road. ""And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love""...the Russells make."

Nice, oily texture.  Strawberries, apple with brown sugar all over the tongue.  Oh damn, that’s good.  Caramel blast transitions to vanilla and leaves you with the pie crust on the legs.  Legs last awhile and transition to a dry peanut.  That nutty note is becoming more and more predominant as time goes on.

What a great pour.  Best Russell’s Reserve pick I have had yet.  I might even put this in a blind flight of my favorite 2019 purchases."

4.75,"Color is beautiful golden amber. Legs are notably viscous. Nose is vanilla, butter, and bread with undertones of spice and dark fruits. Gaining complexity the longer I sit here smelling it. After a few minutes, the nose noticeably softened and opened up to the more delicate scents of pears and peaches. Initial palate is thick with a smooth burn. Subsequent sips result in a palate of chocolate, vanilla, and cinnamon; the spiciness perfectly balances out the sweetness to the point that neither are overpowering.  Much like the nose, the palate becomes more complex and new flavors jump out every sip: coffee, smoke, pepper, oak. The finish is smooth and deep, creating that pleasant warm feeling lasting well beyond the last sip. Overall, I love the complexity of this bourbon. I bought this bottle on sale specifically because I enjoyed their single barrel rye so much; I think this one might be even better. As I work my way up the ladder of nicer bourbons, this one currently sits on the top of the list."

This barrel was picked on a -17• day. Picturing myself on a -17 degree day, this bourbon would be a slam dunk. Super warming and gives a hell of a kentucky hug. On a normal day though, this is about average. It’s nose is subdued with some bright notes, but has ethanol throughout. The palate is the opposite, big bold and in your face. Unfortunately, it has an overpowering flavor of oak. Hopefully as the bottle oxidizes, this will get more balanced and flavorful."

4.0,"BACKGROUND: Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel first appeared on liquor store shelves in 2013, and the barrels used for bottling are touted as the hand-picked, cream-of-the-crop personally selected by Wild Turkey Master Distillers Jimmy and Eddie Russell from the center cut of the rickhouse.

Before being considered for selection, the bourbon is aged in the deepest number 4 or “alligator” charred American white oak barrels to ensure the richest flavor and color. 

Unlike many whiskies on the market, the bourbon in RRSB is also non-chill filtered.  Chill-filtration is a  common  process whereby the whiskey is chilled  at temperatures below freezing and is passed through an absorption filter, thus removing fatty acids and other flavor contributors such as esters and proteins.  By avoiding the chill-filtration process, the whiskey is bottled with more flavor compounds and a deeper color, which is denoted by an impressive haze when ice or chilled water is added.

It is interesting to note that Wild Turkey uses only one mashbill for its entire bourbon line - Wild Turkey 80, WT101, Rare Breed, Russell’s Reserve, Kentucky Spirit, and others - and the differences in flavors among expressions are almost entirely the result of aging and placement.

The lone bourbon mashbill consists of 75% corn, 13% rye, and 12% barley.  Its single rye mashbill is comprised of 51% rye, 37% corn, and 12% barley.
The 110 proof Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel retails for $60, which is about $20 more than the 90 proof Russell’s Reserve white label that carries a 10 year age statement. 

A special 114 proof Russell’s Reserve that was distilled in 2002 costs $250, but it is a bit of a unicorn as only 3,640 bottles were released.
 
NOSE: For a 110 proof bourbon, the nose is quite sweet, delicate, and reserved.  It offers oak (RRSB is rumored to be aged 8 to 9 years), orange peel, sugary vanilla cake frosting, and a good bit of corn.

PALATE: The palate starts with an alcohol bang from the get-go, and it is followed by loads of oak, cinnamon, dark cherry tartness, and the aforementioned vanilla frosting.  The experience is almost a seesaw of sweet and spice in alternating waves.  The viscosity is so delightfully thick that the bourbon is almost chewy.  

FINISH: The finish is long and warming and all of the flavors dissolve into a lingering rye mint.  A touch of oaky bitterness tickles the back of the throat.

FINAL ASSESSMENT:  This is not a beginner’s bourbon, but rather one that experienced bourbon aficionados will pull off of their shelf time and time again.  

When you consider that its standard WT101 expression, Rare Breed, Russell’s 10 Year, and this single barrel can all be purchased for $60 or less, Wild Turkey likely offers consumers among the best bottle-for-bottle return on investment of any distillery.

Plus…I think Jimmy Russell is one of the coolest sumbitches alive and kicking today."

NOSE: Wild Turkey Funk is front and center. Dry Dusty Barn Wood, Straw, Dry Leather, and Vanilla. After a little time in the Glencairn, Orange Peel and Chocolate show up. There is a bit of heat present as well.
NEAT: Relatively Thick and Clingy. Sweet Oak up front, Vanilla, Orange Peel, and Black Pepper Tingle. The Oak becomes very Astringent on the back of the tongue. Big, gradually growing KY HUG with Bitter Oak and Light Vanilla coating the palate.
SPLASH: A little water really helps this one. Mouthfeel becomes almost creamy. The palate gets Cinnamon Discs hard candy, Salted Butter, and heightened Vanilla. The Heat and Astringency is dialed way back. The Cinnamon Candy lingers on the finish with Musty Oak. Much better.
VERDICT: I waited about a 1/4 of a bottle before reviewing this, and I'm glad I did. The first few pours were not to my liking. Some time open has really helped.

The rye in the mash bill is coming through beautifully, too, with rosemary, thyme, and maybe a touch of dill.  Banana, strawberry, and cherries.  For something at 110 proof, the nose is surprisingly gentle and approachable.

Palate: Classic - oak, brown sugar, and vanilla.  Baking spices from the nose come through, but presenting much more assertively.  Hershey's process cocoa, camphor.  Tannin is absolutely evident, both in taste and texture, but not overpowering.  Mouthfeel is medium-light.  Finish begins wish an excellent wash of mint, vanilla, black pepper, baking spices, chocolate, and rye spice.  The tannin swells up and most of the flavors start to fade, though the mint transforms into an almost wintergreen character.  A slightly creamy characteristic pokes in, and then everything slowly fades.  Very slowly.  There's some good oil content here, lending to a long finish.

Other notes: I keep saying it, Wild Turkey is turning out some excellent examples in the different categories they deal in.  Is this unusual or doing something different with the Bourbon template?  No.  But it does serve as a top-tier example of what the category is capable of when you refine and hone your distilling and maturation processes to a high degree.  This has high rebuy potential for me."

4.0,"Nose: pretty modest,  but a sweet oaky scent is present.
Tons of flavor. A lot more oak than what I expected. Nice vanilla and caramel on the back end. Great warmth throughout that extends into the chest. Maintains smoothness however."

4.5,"Outstanding. Rich with a long finish, slightly peppery on the way out. Just enough to enjoy it without being overpowered by it. Smooth despite the ABV."

4.25,"This is a Binny’s Beverage Depot Store Pick. 

Sweet on the nose - caramel, vanilla. It’s a medium to full body feel. The palate comes with cinnamon and heat that fades to caramel, vanilla and coconut. The finish is long - starts with oak and fades back to the caramel, coconut, chocolates. Very good bourbon!"

4.0,"Light and classic nose. Floral with spice. Caramel and cherry. Brown sugar. Perfect mix of classic flavors and spice.

Round and rich. Complex but still light. Medium finish. 

I use the rating scale below. Distiller uses a scale of 5 and I use a scale of 10, but I’m sure you’re not too drunk to do the math! 

1. Disgusting - So bad I poured it out.
2. Poor - I wouldn't consume by choice.
3. Bad - Multiple flaws.
4. Below average - Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.
5. Good - Just average.
6. Very Good - Better than average.
7. Great - Well above average.
8. Excellent - In a league of its own.
9. Incredible - An all-time favorite.
10. Perfect"

5.0,"Hot up front with a ton of spice. Very full, rich and oily with a great mouth feel. Longer finish with and explosion of hot cinnamon, then huge Vanilla and a bit of cherry. Holds up well to ice, but really doesn't need it.
I can say it's worth every penny of it's $50 price tag.
This has  become my very favorite in the price range."

4.25,"This is from a local store in Hendersonville, TN (just outside Nashville) called Center Point Liquors. Warehouse B, 4th floor, 8 years and 6 months.

The nose is sweet with vanilla frosting, caramelized red apples and plumbs, raisins, rye and other baking spices, light chocolate, along with some wild turkey funk, which I describe as an empty peanut can with some dusty peanut debris, and there’s also a hint of baked bread. Very pleasant nose.

The palate is sweet and medium viscosity. It has rye spice, chocolate, caramel, vanilla frosting, a little bit of dried fruit and dusty peanut can.

The finish is long with cooked plumbs, corn, and a lingering rye spice on the back of the palate.

This is probably the best Russel’s Reserve Single Barrel store pick that I have had, and it was a neck pour! This one has all of the classic Wild Turkey profile notes that I love in spades."

4.25,"I’ve heard a lot of good things about Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel but never thought to give it a try. Surely enough, my first experience did not disappoint. I tasted an expression from Barrel 19-0257/Rickhouse F/Floor 611. From the moment I began to pour this elixir into my Copita nosing glass I could smell the ethanol emanating from it which told me it was a high proof bourbon. Although bottled at 110 proof/55% ABV, it is very well balanced and rounded off with some delightful sweet notes. Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel is comprised of 75% corn, 13% rye and 12% malted barley then matured in number 4 “alligator” charred American White Oak barrels. This non-chilled filtered whiskey is hand-selected by Master Distillers Jimmy and Eddie Russell.

Color: Rose Copper

The tasting was superb starting with hints of burnt caramel, toffee, cloves, brown sugar, oak, cinnamon, and orange citrus notes on the nose. Following, on the palate were notes of oak, pepper, vanilla, cinnamon spice, nuts, baking spices, and some cherry fruitiness. The finish is long, slow, and warming with lingering pepper notes with oak and vanilla."
