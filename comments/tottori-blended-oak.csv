3.0,Bourbon on the nose but not as much on the palate.
3.5,Another good Japanese whiskey. BUSHIDO!!
3.25,"Nose: floral, sherry, herbaceous and rose petal, light 
Body: light-medium
Palate: very light, honey, grainy maltiness with spice on the end. 
Finish: short
Note: very very light and simple. Like the ex bourbon I wonder if this has rice in it, has a sake undertone. Wheated malt."
