3.5,Fruity with maybe a peat after thought
0.25,"Nose: A rather sour grainy cereal note and some thin malty aromas. It's very spirity and full of the smell of young, low quality grain whisky. There is no cask presence at all (these barrels must have been on their very last legs) and no aroma of smoke. A very poor and generic nose.

Palate:  A hard, hot, and unpleasantly spiky arrival that turns instantly into bitterness accompanied by some of the worst ""smoke"" I've encountered on a palate. It doesn't taste like real peat-reek at all, it's more like some sort of dosage, like the vile boisé that is sometimes added to cognac, or the flavour of home-made whisky force-matured with oak chips. The texture is thin and watery.

Finish: Blindingly short. A sweet/sour aftertaste lingers, but it's just the sweetness of alcohol.

Horrible. I had hopes that the smoky version of Grant's bottom-shelf blended scotch would be an improvement over the awful standard version, but it's just the opposite. This is quite possibly the worst blended whisky I've ever tasted, and just to rub salt into the wound it is far from the cheapest bottle on the shelf. I've given it a quarter point on the assumption that there is no methanol present.
