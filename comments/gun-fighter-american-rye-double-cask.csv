0.5,The nose is horrid. Smells like the tail end of a silly string can. The flavor is only slightly better. Please understand the double barrel bourbon is one of my absolute favorites. Don’t be fooled.

3.5,"Nose: almost like a cognac with sweet berries and flora with the oak undertones. Only a bit of rye pepper spice. 

Palate: strong burn on first sip. The initial taste is very sweet, again almost cognac like. It then burst into the rye white pepper spice with a mix of the oak barrel. The finish lingers on the tongue with a hint of dried fruits."
3.0,Decent but not my preferred drink.
