3.75,"Bright and sweet on the nose, like sour candied apples. Oak is there, and burnt sugar. On the palate, sweet notes, like toasted caramel and pie filling up front, then salted butter towards in the middle. A cinnamony spice prickles the tongue for a while. This is like buttery fruit pie. Slight astringent wood notes, pepper, and furniture polish on the finish, and mild bitterness lingers. Pleasant sipper, with  strong enough flavors. Well done, Crown Royal. 4/28/19"

4.0,"On first tasting, reminiscent of American bourbon. As age increases after opening, flavor seems to revert to more typical crown royal flavor. Very smooth, even for CR, this is definitely worth a try."

5.0,Excellent.  One of the best ever
3.75,"This is a Bourbon (yes I said Bourbon) that I have been interested in for a while. However, call it a Crown Royal bias, I could never bring myself to pull the trigger. I searched for a pour, but again struck out. When I finally decided I would take the plunge, it was sold out (curse you Whiskey Advocate! This was the #5 whiskey on the 2018 list). Finally this week it was back in stock and armed with a $100 GC I received over Christmas I quickly pulled the trigger. 
Now of course because this is distilled in Canada it cannot be officially called a Bourbon, however, if it was distilled in the USA it would meet all the criteria. The Mashbill is the equivalent of a high rye bourbon (60% corn, 36% rye and 4% Malted barley). It's age stated at 13 yrs which makes this a pretty good value if the taste holds up. Let's move to the tasting.
On the pallette it's creamy and very smooth. You initially get vanilla, butterscotch and green apple notes. Mid pallette the spice and oak really kick up with clove black pepper being the predominant spices. The oak continues thru the finish with floral and toffee undertones. There is also a decent burn for the proof. 
It's not quite an oak bomb but the oak is very pronounced. However, it's all in balance so that's not a bad thing. The main thing preventing this from being a 5 star dram is the other notes are pretty subtle. I would have preferred them to be more amplified.
That said, all in all this is a lovely pour. A worthy addition to any cabinet of someone who appreciates oaky or high rye bourbon. As I write this review the finish and spice tingle lingers. It's a nice long finish. 3.75-4/5. Cheers all and TGIF!"

4.25,"The nose is creamy with vanilla, chocolate fudge abs brown sugar. The palate is mild and well balanced with baking spices, vanilla and hints of caramel. The finish is medium long with fading pepper, vanilla, brown sugar and creme brûlée. Excellent."

4.0,Very oaky expression from Crown Royal. Significant barrel influence from the thirteen years aging. Tannic finish. Much more interesting than any other Crown Royal I’ve tried. Definitely a drier Crown with little of that traditional CR sweetness to be found.

3.0,"Wow...two weeks since I’ve had a proper pour ( and no, two wee sips of what was left in the Tobias and Angel bottle doesn’t count).  So—I decided to have this week’s pour in the form of this 13 yr Canadian “bourbon”, courtesy sent by my buddy @dubz480.  

I’m a huge fan of Crown Royal’s first in their Noble series: the Cornerstone, which coincidentally was also awarded “best” by that Panama hat wearing self proclaimed whiskey guru Jimbo Murray.  Based on how much I liked that one, I bought their follow up act in the Noble series, Wine Barrel finish, which I wasn’t a fan of, nor did I dislike it...was middle of the road.  I never tried their 3rd release ( French oak), having quickly written off Noble collection as a one hit wonder.  This one here is their 4th in the series.  This is the oldest of the Noble collection, and I think the only one with an age statement.  With a mashbill of 60/36/4 corn/rye/barley, why is it not called bourbon?  Well...that’s because ‘Mercia has a monopoly on the name “bourbon”.  To be called bourbon, you need to have it made in the US of A.  Who says the French are the only ones defensive of terroir ?  We can play that game too.  

Anyway—for 13 years, this is pretty restrained..very much like a pissed off Canadian.  Minimal sweetness, some oak and cloves.  It’s not bad, but I’d have expected more more carrying a lofty title like Noble.  But...at $60-70, it’s a damn good VFM.  Where else can you get a pretty good 13 yr old for $60?  Ask Whistlepig...tell say a 13 yr Canadian is about $200;  and Barrell will say it’s about $110.  So...all in all, not a bad deal.  

Thanks dubz for the pour!"
4.75,"This is not bourbon whiskey.

That’s what the sticker on the purple tube says. It’s what the sticker on the bottle says. I must’ve gotten a rogue batch before production consulted legal, because mine doesn’t say “blenders mash”. It says “bourbon mash”. But don’t worry: this is not bourbon whiskey.

It’s made from a bourbon mash bill, aged in new, charred American white oak barrels. It pours out beautifully into a snifter, amber in hue. But don’t worry: this is not bourbon whiskey.

Nose is dusty. You can smell the extra age in the oak. I can also pick out caramel, lemon, and raspberries, but the oak is the main feature. This is not bourbon whiskey.

Body flavors are subtle, but the mouth feel packs a punch. Don’t go into this dram with chapped lips. It’s far mellower than I expected based on the oak nose. Caramel, honey, and powdered sugar are present. Bit of raspberry. It’s hot, particularly for 90 proof, but hot damn is it delicious. This is not bourbon whiskey.

Finish endures longer than expected. The heat from the body turns to pure black pepper, and it buzzes on pleasantly, particularly on the front rim of your tongue. This is not bourbon whiskey.

Can I just say it? This song and dance is kind of ridiculous. This dram is a better “not bourbon whiskey” than most bourbons I’ve tried. It’s intense and subtle in all the right places. It’s affordable. I really love the transitions. It’s almost as if someone crafted a really dynamic whiskey, much the same way one would craft a bourbon, but with an extreme talent that many bourbon producers lack. Oh yeah, and it was crafted in Canada. Whoops. Finger wag. Slap of the wrist.

IMHO: if Blanton’s can make bourbon that Americans CAN’T have, I’m not going to beat up on some Canadians who make a delicious bourbon that Americans can. That’s right. I said it. But DO NOT WORRY: this is not bourbon whiskey."
