I really enjoyed this bourbon. Nose of maple syrup, cedar and oak. Smooth and a little sweet on the palate too. Like burnt brown sugar. Reminds of sitting by the campfire which I'm doing right now sipping this bourbon :) definitely a good buy for me and if you're looking for something unique. I would buy another bottle for sure, not sure why it's not rated higher by others."

4.0,Strong wood and maple brown sugar nose. Wood homes thru as cedar on the palate. Citrus followed by caramel. Some peaty qualities.

null,Absolutely terrible! Yuck. I spent $145 on bottle. It isn't worth $5. I was hoping it would taste somewhat like original from Kentucky. Never been more disappointed in a bottle. They are selling the old name brand. I feel wambuzeled.

4.0,"Char, vanilla, oak, not young, not sweet, sandalwood,"
1.5,"A sample from dthom as part of the ""Whiskey transfer program"".

Nose:  Right up front super heavy peanut.    Vanilla, honey, dried cherry, cedar, apple, background grassy notes.  Very fruity and nutty.  A complex pleasing nose.

Flavor: Super weird and off putting.  Very herbal and grassy and very hot ethanol burn up front.  Nondescript sweet notes.

Finish:  Finishes medium short with cucumber and spice notes transitioning into more toasted peanut.

The nose on this was super complex and pleasing and then the flavor and finish were just super weird.  It almost has notes on the tongue of gin.  It's interesting but that's all that can be said here.  If you're looking for a solid bourbon that hits the usual notes this isn't it.  Kind of gross to be honest."

3.25,"This is really an odd one. The nose is dominated by an intense minerality, with piney notes, hints of damp soil, decomposing plant matter, wet rocks (for lack of a better description), and just a hint of something kind of like mint tea with honey. Things look a little like they’re going to push in the direction of gin, but they don’t go so far as to be off putting. The taste really hones in on those notes of tea and honey, bringing in a light note of lemon, and a pervasive grassiness. The mid palate starts to bring out more in the way of light barrel char and smoke, but only ever hints at the classic vanilla-caramel wood sugars. The finish brings out strange reminiscences of a strong, cool breeze over a damp forest floor. It sounds strange, but you’ll know what I mean if you taste this. A truly odd and unique bourbon, it shies away from all of the classic sweet, dessert-like notes of a classic bourbon, instead landing solidly in the space of light, mineral-forward herbaceous honey. This is a whiskey I would reach for on a crisp, damp autumn day. Not my favorite, but a unique journey nonetheless."

3.0,"Not bad. Alot of cherry vanilla for the nose. Caramel up front, fading to oak, and a very brief finish with vanilla and butterscotch. The heat is all up front. I've had more pleasurable whiskeys for less money."

3.0,"This batch (they don't even identify which one it is on the bottle) is a huge disappointment compared to a taste I had about three years ago at a bar, and no, that one wasn't the original Kentucky Black Maple Hill. The one I had three years ago was complex, floral, and balanced, like Blanton's only better. This batch is astringent and doesn't show much more than peanuts and oak."

1.0,"Most overpriced bourbon I’ve had, glad it was a gift.  Hard to describe it, really doesn’t taste like a bourbon, very young can’t be more than 2 years old?   Only reason I’m taking my time to write this is so others don’t waste their $$ on this one.   Just not very good at all."

1.0,"If this is bourbon then I'm a monkey's uncle.  It's all over the place - not sure what it wants to be and at nearly $100 bottle I feel cheated.  Thin, somewhat harsh, weird nose.  If I was locked in a room with baby Hitler, the producers of this bourbon and a gun with 2 bullets I'd shoot the producer's of this bourbon.  Twice."
2.0,"Found this harsh and stringent. Too many thorny notes. Like a mouthful of fire ants I'd imagine. Cutting with water helped smooth out a bit. But funky wood notes still present. For all the hype, I was greatly disappointed."

I put a number just to put one. Probably the worst bourbon I’ve had. I’ll admit the hype got me to try this and I have now learned. 

Nose: sweet caramel char, mashed barn hay

Flavor: matches nose, sweet caramel/ vanilla, “off putting” weird lingering taste as mentioned. It tastes like fermented hay from a barn, grassy, earthy, not for the better. 

Overall: I would not drink this if someone gave it to me. At $80 a bottle I should have wiped my ass with the money and flushed it. I would suggest not paying money to try this. If you want a sample, I will send you one. 

I would like to know if the original Kentucky version of this bourbon tasted similar. Comment if you can. Thanks guys. Happy bourboning!"

2.0,"I've had this bottle for a few months now, and it isn't improving. Fresh corn and faint caramel on the nose. Corn, peanuts, and craft whiskey (licking a piece of wood) on the palate. Very thin mouthfeel. I'm guessing this is no longer sourced, or there is significant new make whiskey in the blend."
3.0,"Dry, almost salty. Maybe it’s the charred barrel. It’s OK"
4.0,Very strong Barrel character. Complex and tasty. Logged 7/10/17.
5.0,"Nose: cherry, vanilla, cobbler fresh out of the oven 

Taste: floral, sorghum, plenty of oak

Finish: ALL the heat came up front, this finishes so smooth that you forget it’s alcohol. Get a very nice breath of vanilla as it goes down"
