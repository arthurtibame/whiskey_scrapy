2.75,"A bit of a step up from the regular rich & rare. On the sweet side in both aroma and taste, maple/vanilla sweetness come out strong up front and only faint oak in the back end. Imported from Canada and bottled in Kentucky (Sazerac)  Minimum age: 3 years Grade: C+"
2.5,"Not a bad Canadian for the price. There are probably others in the $10 range that are better, but this was serviceable. Slightly sour, little bit of a alcoholic burn that softens with ice or in a mixed drink."
3.5,Cheap. Smooth and simple.
4.0,"What an amazing budget bottle of Canadian whiskey. I opened this with my dad over the weekend and what a wonderful smooth sipping whiskey this is. To me, this is what Crown Royal wants to be. A very smooth full-flavored whiskey that has a clean crisp taste and a pleasantly warm feel as it leaves my mouth. It has soft vanilla and sweet nose and it mixes very well with everything I have tried so far like coke and ginger ale. At $10 to $12 buck in my area, I have no issue with mixing this but it is smooth enough to drink neat or with ice. Well done Canada. This is the only Canadian whiskey I have at the moment but when I am done looking for a few specific Irish whiskeys I will take a hard look at our whiskey brothers to the north and see what they are really about. If anyone has suggestions I am open to them. As far as Rich and Rare Reserve is concerned it is a no brainer it is smooth neat and you can mix it and not be upset about it. It is a keeper."

3.0,Simple and smooth. Cheap
3.5,"It is more full-flavored than many bottom and mid-shelf Canadians. The vanilla, butter-toffee and toasted oak flavors are well rounded and smooth. There is no real complexity or great depth here; but, I don't always require those. Sometimes it is nice to just have a smooth dram that is tasty and easy to drink, while my mind is elsewhere. It is a bargain at $17 for a 1.75."
