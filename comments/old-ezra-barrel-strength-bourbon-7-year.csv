4.0,"Taste:  1 oz. in glen cairn first and then addition of 3 drops distilled water then rested for 15 minutes.

Nose (3.75):  Initial nose is a full on caramel, butterscotch,  oak and ethanol. Traditional bourbon nose.  Very upfront and not very complex.  The ethanol hits you hard.  Let it air out.

Palate:  (4.25)  Straight out of the bottle it tends to be hot.  The ethanol is strong and the palate intensifies from what's on the nose.  I was not overwhelmingly approving of the palate without cutting it.  Resting it with some water was different story entirely.  Transformed the experience to taste bit-o-honey, candied apple, intensified the butterscotch.  The ethanol and heat were just the right amount then.  Again not a puzzling or complex bourbon, but just what you would want if you love to drink traditional aged bourbon that hasn't been amped up by an additional finish in a ""spirit of the day"" cask or sloshed around on a ship for awhile.  Tastes from this one seem to be all barrel magic.

Finish (4.0):  When neat it was super spicy.  Surprised me with spice and I must admit made me cough just a little.  When neat it was a 3/5 and a little rough.  With water and 15 minutes of patience it is a downright 4-5.  Damn fine whisky!

Overall-  Definately a Heavan Hill product here without doubt.  Reminds me of Elijah Craig Barrel Proof and checks all the flavor profile boxes of quality Heaven Hill product.  Well constructed and very pleasing.  Water simply transforms it.  My advice is that if you see it at MSRP ($40-45) buy it and bunker a few bottles.  The word is getting out on this one because it is a sleeper and like the ECBP my guess is that it will head upwards of $60 and be on allocation by next year.  The secondary market will be looking hard for it.  Great bourbon to be on the ground floor with"

3.75,"It is very smooth for how strong the proof is with a mile burn at the back of the throat (aka. Kentucky hug). The palate is not as deep and complex as I would like. It has the standard bourbon tastes, but for the price of roughly $50. It is worth it. This would be a good daily drinker in my opinion.  I tried this neat."

3.5,"117 proof 7 year old bourbon from Kentucky.   Although Luxco has a “distillery” now, this is sourced from somewhere.  Heaven Hill seems to be the lead suspect.  In an age of no age statements, it’s nice to see some of the dying breed.

N:  Oak, vanilla, toffee, cinnamon, orange peel.

P:  Toffee, pralines, brown sugar, vanilla, oranges.

F:  Oak, allspice, toffee, burnt sugar.

A chip off the ‘ole block.  Pretty much what you would expect, if you’ve ever had the (now discontinued) 101 proof version of this.  Similar to JW Dant Bonded as well.  Heavy on the pralines and brown sugar.  People seem to be getting excited about this in some of bourbon groups online, but I’m not sure why.  It’s decent in my opinion, but nothing to get excited about.  It is a pretty good value though.  A 117 proof bourbon for $35 to $40 nowadays is pretty rare - plus it has a 7 year age statement which is right around the 8 to 12 year wheelhouse where good bourbons usually are found."

4.5,"Truly a fantastic barrel proof bourbon! Traditional notes of vanilla, caramel, lots of oak (which I love), cinnamon spice and hints of leather. Incredibly smooth neat, long warming finish without any burn. My fave mid priced barrel proof and go to remains WT Rare Breed however, this is firmly right behind it. What a great find! Enjoy"
4.0,"Fun fact:

I bought this bottle at least a month ago for $38 at my local liquor store. There are still bottles on the shelf. 15 minutes away, there’s a liquor store selling the same bottle for $250. Don’t fall for it.

That said, this bottle delivers for $40. Nose is floral and sweet, like honeysuckle. Body tastes like powdered sugar, and finish carries a nice cinnamon buzz.

With water added:

Body opens up a bit. I get more vanilla and less pure sugary sweetness. Finish is greatly diminished, and for my 2-cents-worth, not in a good way. I think I prefer this one neat, which is a bit unusual for me. If I could shoehorn the body once water was added, to the nose and finish when poured neat, that would be ideal."

4.25,"The nose is mostly oak, leather, toffee, peanuts, very little ethanol. Peanuts become more prevalent with time in the glass. The palate is fairly thin and dry. Lots of oak followed by leather. Caramel and smoke try to break through, but stay in the background. Again, really no warmth except for the transition to the finish. The finish has leather, caramel, smoke, all in a really nice balance. A little warm. Everything lingers for a long while. Really nice finish."

4.25,null
4.25,"Nose: Fall Spices. Cinnamon, Orange Peel, Dried Peaches, Burnt Sugar, Clove and a good dose of Oak.
Neat: Thick and Chewy. Nearly all of the notes from the nose carry over with a peanut butter note joining in. A healthy dose of Oak Tannins make this a tick on the astringent side. Lots of heat, but in a good sense. 
Finish: Goes down with a nice warming in the chest. Leaves bitter spice along the sides of the tongue. Coats the rest of the palate with a hint of  lingering musty oak that I really like and find in most older Heaven Hill products (McK 10 year, Evan Williams Single Barrel, Rebel Yell 10 year).
Splash: Very beneficial... Brings a little more depth to the palate. You get hints of the traditional butterscotch and toffee. Allows the oak note to rise above the heat as well without killing that peppery spice on the end.
Verdict?: I found this very similar to Elijah Craig Barrel Proof. Dare I say, ""Poor Man's Elijah Craig BP""? If this can be found at the suggested retail of $40, it's a no-brainer. My fear is that this will follow the model of Rebel Yell 10 year and spike in price after the initial release. I do want to say that whoever is in charge of recent bottle/label design and marketing at LuxCo is doing a great job, especially with the Ezra Brooks line. If they can maintain this level of quality with their own distillate, this will be a company to reckon with moving forward."

4.75,"Back a few years ago, I discovered this bourbon's forebear, the Old Ezra 7 Year standard bottling, which continues to be a heck of a bargain. When I heard that they were releasing a barrel strength version, my excitement was visceral...and became nearly uncontrollable when folks like Fred Minnick started singing its glories. At long last, it made it to Wisconsin...and I snapped up the first bottle I found.

It's as good as I'd hoped. The nose is the Platonic form of bourbon nose - loads of baking spice, baked cherry, vanilla, caramel, black pepper, leather. There's a little nose hair-tweaking heat, but it's not an overly boozy nose for the abv. If the nose is good, the taste is even better. This is what bourbon is supposed to be - rich, coating, buttery, positively exploding with character. You want spices? You got it. Vanilla? Yup. Caramel? It practically oozes out of your mouth. Woody, leathery notes? Just enough to lend some complexity without hitting you over the head. Nuttiness? Present. It's like pecan pie in a glass. The finish lasts a nice, long while, too.

This is good. Damn good. So damn good. And, for $40-ish a bottle? Get out of town."

Totally a perfect classic bourbon. Now halfway through the bottle and I get a small hint of peanut on the finish, though not as strong as Booker’s. Really nice one to have on hand. 

Lucky to get this on sale at $31.99."
4.25,"N: Quite sweet. Orange, vanilla, butterscotch, oak, leather, little bit of pepper. 
P: Tons of Barrel on the palate which is surprising for only 7 yrs. Nice amounts of sweet oak and leather. The proof really starts to ramp up mid palate and lingers with a nice finish isn’t too long and really invites you in for another taste. Can’t complain with this at its retail price. Well done."
3.75,"Nose: strong alcohol that drowns out other more subtle notes. Maybe some cinnamon and cloves but could be my imagination

Mouthfeel: thick and chewy with some softness 

Taste: subtle up front with some raisin and cinnamon, immediately drowned out by strong flush of ethanol, heat, and spice the second it touches oxygen. Fire goes out quickly with a subtle muted finish for a barrel proof. Better after it opens up a bit, but maybe a smidge over hyped"

The high corn bill is unmistakable.  Very lown burn for something only 7 years old. Worth the price I paid."

5.0,"My favorite bourbon — despite the higher proof, the Old Ezra 7-Year sips very smooth and has just the right flavor profile. No heavy ethanol on the nose, no harshness on the tongue, no burn going down."
5.0,"I was compelled to buy this one after a friend sent me an article that discussed the 2018 bourbon of the year. This one beat out Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, which, though I'd yet to try it, had enough of a reputation to get me interested in this Old Ezra. After seeing it at a very reasonable $45, I pulled the trigger.

Nose: Traditional bourbon notes turned up a notch. Very rich. Big-time caramel, brown sugar, and oak. I'm not sure what the mash bill is here, but the corn notes really come through. Beneath that, I get new couch leather and tobacco. A trace of vanilla. Great nose.

Palate: Heavy caramel, vanilla, butterscotch, peanut, and sweet cola. Shockingly easy-going upon arrival. This changes, however, when the spice kicks in on the mid-palate. Lots of cinnamon, as well as nutmeg and other baking spices. Oak is prominent throughout.

Finish: Medium-to-long. Maybe a tad shorter than I was expecting considering the ABV, but it's still very respectable. Spicy cinnamon hits hard. The charcoal-mellowing also shows up here. While I can identify the same characteristic that I get in Jack Daniel's products, it's done infinitely better in this one.

Bourbon of the year? Maybe. I'd probably take the Elijah Craig (though to be fair the one I picked up was 2017). However, this is half the price of that one, and really not all that far behind. This one punches well above its weight class in terms of quality, but has is as drinkable as far weaker bourbons. At $45 it's a no-brainer, and quite possibly the best value of 2018. If you're into bourbon, pick this one up. It will not disappoint.

Edit: I've finally finished this one 3 months after cracking. After some oxidation, I must say that it has only gotten better with time. I've decided to bump it from 4.75 to 5 stars because it's amazingly balanced and comes at a ridiculously low price when you consider what's inside."

4.5,"Look: Light amber orange, really a lot lighter than most barrel strength bourbons I’ve encountered. There’s some alcohol legs showing on the glass

Nose: First thing I get is cinnamon followed by more rye ala clove. Vanilla comes in bringing some sweetness.

Palate: leads off with that rye presence of baking spices cinnamon and of course vanilla.  Oak comes into play near the finish more

Finish: Not as hot as one would expect for a barrel proofer.  Pepper cinnamon oak flavor on the finish, mid bitterness from the wood, with a long lasting finish of the previously mentioned flavors.  There’s some heat but again not what you’d expect on this.  
Overall: An extremely easy drinking barre proof with a good amount of flavor, and low price tag. What’s not to love?"

With 1 ice cube it is like a whole different dram. All sweet."
4.0,"I have long moaned about the fact that on the west coast we are slow to receive distribution of a lot of newer Bourbon releases. This is a good example of this issue. This Bourbon has been out for months, picked up numerous awards (including best straight Bourbon at the 2019 SF Spirits Competition) and this is the very first time I have seen it in the Phoenix market. $1 over SRP makes it an instant buy for me. So does it live up to the hype? We will get into that shortly. First some background:
Mashbill: 78% corn, 12% malted barley and 10% rye.
Age Stated at 7 yrs
Distillery undisclosed (rumored to be Heaven Hill)
117 proof
It is Charcoal Mellowed (chill filtered) 
Distribution by Luxco (Rebel Yell, Blood Oath etc)
On to the tasting:
On the palatte it's very rich and sweet with classic Bourbon notes of toffee, vanilla and burnt brown sugar. The heat is very evident on the mid palette which adds oak, barrel spice and a rich toffee note. The finish is pretty long with plenty of heat, oak, more barrel spice and a lingering toffee dipped cherry note. 
I can just picture an old west scene with the main character sipping on a Bourbon like this. It's definitely one that puts hair on your chest. It's classic, simple, hot Kentucky Bourbon. I found that adding water or ice took away from the experience. This is one for someone with experience drinking Barrel Proof Bourbon. It's like a better OGD 114. The heat reminds of the older Booker's batches. It's hot, but in a good way if that makes sense. 
So in summation, is this on the ECBP, Stagg Jr, Booker's level? In short no. But it's also considerably cheaper. 
At $40-$45 it's an outstanding value. However, let me be clear, it's not worth paying above the odds and nor are you getting something that will blow you away. Keeping all that in mind, it's a must have to any high proof Bourbon lovers shelf. All things considered (most importantly price paid) this one gets a solid 4/5. Happy to have finally found this. Cheers all and TGIF"

4.0,"This is really great whiskey!  Cinnamon abounds.(I love cinnamon). Flavor after flavor.  The finish is like having Dentyne gum in your mouth.  When tasting, there is no way to guess it is 117 proof.  It has 117 flavor and drinks like a 90.  A very good deal for $45 in NC."
4.25,"Nose: tobacco, leather, baking spice - spicier than cinnamon but not quite clove, black tea, anise
Taste: vanilla, malty, oak
Finish: hot, oak
After reading reviews: I didn’t find this as sweet as the reviews suggest.  Cherry did make sense on the taste once I saw that.  Fig may be what I got as maltiness - reminiscent of a scotch note.  Wonderful nose, but a little too much barrel bitterness from the oak for my taste keeps it from being great overall."

null,"Nose: Extremely accessible for sitting at 117 proof. You can really dig your nose all the way into the glass without feeling like you burned off your nose. Notes of brown sugar toffee with nuts, creamy corn, fig newtons, and spicy Mexican vanilla engulf the nose. Underneath, the oak stands it ground with remnants of nutmeg and burnt toast. 

Palate: All the fig, corn, nuts and toffee transfer to the initial and mid-palate. The notes stay centered as well. This is mouth watering and savory, accessing umami flavors. Even though there is a lot of flavor here, it still stays lighter and more inviting than most barrel proof expressions.

Finish: A nice Kentucky Hug takes its grip on your chest, but the burn is surprisingly minimal. The flavors from the nose linger past your bedtime. The spicy vanilla and toffee notes swell and stick with you for at least a minute or two. 

Overall, this is solid as they come. The price point keeps you coming back for more. I like seeing a respectful age-statement, 7-years, which in today's world is a good age. I believe this is sourced from Heaven Hill by Lux Row Distillers."

Nose has a decent amount of vanilla sweetness and some brown sugar. Along with alcohol burn.
The palate is not too sweet with some baking spices and a very nice leather note going on. 
The medium finish let’s you know it’s barrel proof as it goes down.

This tastes a lot like Elijah Craig Barrel Strength but dialed down a little which makes sense given that this is rumored to be a Heaven Hill product and is charcoal mellowed.  VERY good for the price tag."

Verdict: sweet on the nose, get the proof on the palate, mild finish (roasted peanuts/peanut butter) ranked top 20 in whiskey advocate 2019. Expect this to continue to fly off shelves. It is a must have in the barrell proof collection with a lower proof than the bigger named barrell proof offerings on the market. Search for it at retail.

Nose is mix of brown sugar and nuts. I dare say it smells a bit like a fresh baked cookie and who doesn't love a good cookie? Taking a sip and that nut flavor comes on strong washing over like a peanut butter flood. The finish takes an interesting turn. Call me crazy, but I get cinnamon apple pie on the moderate burn.  This is a bit of a wild ride, but like a good roller coaster is one I want to ride over and over. Solid juice here that I will definitely search out again!"

4.25,"Nose - (w/o water) Sweet caramel, oaky cinnamon, light cherry cough drop sweet, oaky vanilla (w/ water) Reduced fruity sweetness, more oaky vanilla caramel

Taste - (w/o water) Mellow, kind of drying cinnamon caramel, light cherry candy, drying oaky vanilla caramel (w/ water) Reduced heat, more dry, less cherry & more oaky cinnamon caramel, fruity sweet reappears at the very end

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering heat/tingle, sweet cherry caramel, cinnamon red hot heat (w/ water) Little to no burn, lingering fruity/cherry lingers, vanilla caramels remain in background

Score - 88/100

Final Thoughts - This one surprised me quite a bit as it wasn't quite as hot as the proof would make you think, which is quite dangerous. I'm mixed about how this handles water in that the mouthfeel is improved, but the cherry is a bit mellowed out. It does help the heat/tingle a bit but it also wasn't that bad for the higher proof in the first place. This isn't too bad for the price but I can see this being quite dangerous as it drinks well below its proof.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

On the nose, those peanuts reign supreme.  It’s like a creamy peanut butter.  Hint of toffee and mint.  Some nice barrel char.  Baking spices.  The peanut butter subsides the longer I sit with it and it has plenty of flavors to pick out behind it.  Starting to get some milk chocolate and sweetness.

Mouth feel is perfect, so creamy.  All cinnamon and brown sugar at first.  Ah, the flavors are fantastic.  The taste exceeds the nose.  Chocolate, peanut butter and toffee are there but then some vanilla and apple.  Nice oak presence on the legs.  Decent amount of brine on there.  Nice caramel drizzle coming through on those apples.  It is a bit more tannic and drying than I would have expected out of a 7 year.

Mmm this is a delicious pour.  Clearly forgot how good this was.  The nose is a bit generic and boring but the taste is fantastic, crisp, creamy, and rich.  Really enjoying this today."
