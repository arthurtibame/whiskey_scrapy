2.25,Tasting it again for second time. Weak. Seems very young. Just not mature enough.  Won’t buy again unless it is aged 8 to 10 minimum.

3.25,"Bought this in Tuscaloosa when I defended my dissertation at UA. It tastes a little young, but sweet. It finishes somewhat hot for the proof, but overall I’m not disappointed by this purchase. I’d buy it again if I was in Alabama, but probably wouldn’t make the extra effort to find it outside of that."
