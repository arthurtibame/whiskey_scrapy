4.0,"* Review transferred from the general listing for Bowmore Tempest. This is a batch release and each batch so far has been very different. Each one should have its own listing.
        
    After a fortnight or more of tasting nothing but inexpensive blends (lordy, the sacrifices we make for science), it is with great delight I turn again to a single malt.

    Nose: Fresh cereal and sweet / bittersweet citrus fruits - tangello, sherbet lemon, mandarin. A very strong scent of grapefruit. Oily floral notes and a lot of brine. A glimpse of smoke.

Palate: Gripping, salty and astringent - so intensely dry it puckers the mouth. Seriously, very salty. Now a hot spicy blast with black pepper in the development. Very sharp and tangy - it quivers with energy like a rattlesnake. This palate is very powerful - honestly, it makes Corryvrecken taste gentle and laid-back.

Finish: Long and very spicy.

Now .. we add water - a teaspoon to about 20ml.

Nose: As above but tempered by a sweet cloud that increases over time. It even develops a hint of Laphroaig hospital bandages.

Palate: A strong and assertive peatiness emerges, with the salt and pepper now happening at the back of the tongue and some ginger and hard salt licorice emerging. Chewing tobacco, pine resin.

Finish: Calmer, but still long and salty peat.
    
This is NOT a beginner's whisky. Give this to a neophyte, particularly neat, and I guarantee they will spit it out and be alienated from scotch whisky forever. However if you are used to whisky this is a most characterful, uncompromising and satisfying dram.

Personally I found it too full-on neat, but with a good dash of water it bloomed and was very interesting. Don't try to tough it out, because water works wonders and unleashes a wealth of aromas and flavours that are otherwise locked up tight by the alcohol.

This is the spiciest and most powerful Tempest ever, and it's the first Bowmore I've tasted that has really engaged me in a big way, but I wouldn't drink it as a relaxing nightcap! This batch really deserves the name ""Tempest"" - it's a roaring, devastating typhoon with a smoky, marine and woody character.

  ""Very Good"" : 4 stars"
