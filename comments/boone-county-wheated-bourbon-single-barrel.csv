4.5,Sweet. Delicate. Mild heat for proof butterscotch. Gallenstein pick
4.75,"Neat.  Neck pour.  Gallenstein pick BCW10.  First, I rarely note color but this is a beautiful auburn.  Quite dark for just 6 years. This nose is lovely, light and bright with a few interesting dark notes as high dive deeper.  Buttered popcorn is the first thing I am pulling out.  Super buttery.  Caramel brittle. Baking spices.  Cinnamon apples. Honey and maple.

Glorious mouth feel.  So velvety.  This is really good, I think this pick beats the one I got from the distillery.  On the tongue it is all this honey and nectar sweetness.  Transitions to even more over the top sweetness.  Cotton candy to hard caramels with intense lingering vanilla.  It’s so oily that waves of caramel keep coming and it rolls down the throat so slowly.  The more I sit with it, darker oak notes straight to come up.

A lovely pour.  I really enjoyed that."
5.0,"Very good flavor for the age, super smooth at 54.4% and doesn’t taste “young” it is very well executed and flavor lingers forever without any awkward flavor notes just a nice clean taste.  Highly recommended..."
2.25,"So galenstein selection 7

109 or so price point. 

Nose - I get bread dough, vanilla, citrus candy, and oak.

Taste - Simple, sweet, vanilla, a bit too much spice (cinnamon/red hot). It's a nice whisky up front but the spice has over powered the sweet. There's that wheat character.

So any good? Yeah, it's good.

Is it worth 110 bucks? hell no!

This is a very nice whisky that is unique and in that i think us geeks will be ok with 109 or so bucks for, but frankly unless you want overly hot, cinnamon, and fankly not overly well aged whisky...maybe you like it? 

2.25 - it's above average, but there's some nice quality here too. Boone County does well with MGP casks for the age, but no 6 year bourbon is special. 

This is bourbon vs wheat whisky and higher proof, but frankly I think the woodford wheat is about on par or better, not sure what I scored the wheat but I'd assume it's better. This does justify more price even if not as good due to proof."

4.5,"Neat. Neck pour. BCW-1. Super buttery with sense of freshly made bread.  Butterscotch and slightly burnt caramel.  Vanilla and a hint of nutmeg.  Barely any alcohol despite being 120ish proof.  Reminds me of Wilderness Trail quite a bit.

Super creamy and oily.  Really coats the mouth.  Lots of brown sugar and powdered sugar up front with a slight hint of oak and apples.  It’s quite delicious.  The taste is a flavor bomb.  Overwhelming butterscotch.  It’s butterscotch on more butterscotch with a hint of those bread notes on the tail end of the legs.  That butterscotch is hanging in the mouth forever.

It’s not complex, but it’s a flavor bomb with that butterscotch.  Super delicious.  So smooth at such a high proof too.  Superior to Wilderness Trail.  Hard to compare to other wheats of similar years like OWA or RC6 because it is pure dessert.  Not much spice or oak to pick apart.  

Is it worth $100?  I think so.  No regrets buying this from the distillery and a great bounce back for Boone County after the Small Batch fell a bit flat for me."
