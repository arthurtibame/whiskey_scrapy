1.0,Not impressed. Thin and watery. Almost no nose at all. Very basic and definitely an entry bourbon for people who don’t like whiskey.
2.0,Sweet vanilla on the nose. Tastes of caramel with far too much alcohol heat. Unfortunately I like this far less than EW's more common Black Label. Not recommended.

4.0,Really like this 1783.  The flavor-to-price ratio is out of this world. It is now my daily supper and my standard I measure other whiskeys against. It's 10$ for a 750ml bottle in Texas but it's almost as tasty as the $50 bottles. In this humble taster's opinion.

3.5,"3.6.  This is a pretty decent bourbon.  Price makes it even better.  Not much up front, but like others said, has a long spicy finish.  I prefer the EW BIB though for about the same price."
2.0,I bought this after reading an article on 10 bourbons that are inexpensive relative to what I normally drink.  It was 16 bucks compared to 25-35 range.  Very mild a bit of bite on the back end.  The aroma and flavor are very light and I do not taste complexities I find in other bourbons at higher price points .  This would be good in some cocktails without breaking the bank.

1.0,"I was hoping this would be a nice ""everyday"" sipping bourbon, but I found the flavor too bitter (tannic?) for me. When mixed, the tannic flavor comes out more oaky, so not a bad mixer, but I prefer more rye notes. Perhaps I need to give it another try someday since others enjoyed it."

4.0,"Disclaimer: I do not pretend to have a refined palate. I am an enthusiast who finds trying new spirits as enjoyable as record collecting.  I know what I like but don't always know why.   I tried the 1783 after reading an excellent review on the wine enthusiast.  I think this is a no-brainer bourbon.  It tastes very nice, with none of the negative characteristics of bottom-shelf spirits.  It is not going to blow your mind,  but unless you are hosting a whiskey tasting party and want to appear erudite and elite, this can't be beat for a great, everyday drink at an incredibly affordable price point."

3.0,"For review #2, I've pulled out an interesting one. Apparently this isn't widely available to all, which is unfortunate. This is one of my all time favorite underdogs. The flavor profile, although it's a tad thin, is amazing for its $12.99 price.  Neat, It's got a nice light burn initially but then sweetens out with loads of vanilla. You can suck it down neat with no regrets, or mix with anything and not feel guilty.  I would put this against bourbons in the $30-$40 dollar range. Similar to EWSB, but different enough to add to the collection. If anyone knows anything else about this gem, let us know. Not a lot of detailed info online about it. This is one of the better bourbon deals on the market, if it's in your market"
3.0,"A curious bottom-shelfer that's started showing up on Canadian shelves, at a strangely high price (perhaps owing to importation and minimum-pricing legislation). Smell is acetone/paint at first, but underneath there's actually a decent hit of caramel and vanilla. Some barrel-char character. A bit green, leafy. Faint apple. Not a lot of the ""grape drink"" flavour I generally get from Heaven Hill bourbons. Taste is thin and a bit hot. Initially some peanuts (not unlike the Beam yeast), then a nice vanilla/caramel sweetness. A bit of creeping bitter/soggy wood. Barrel char. A slight bit of fruitiness, creamed corn, and something evocative of a Scotch blend. Not an awful bourbon--it's got a very stereotypically ""bourbon"" taste profile--but it's thin, and hot, and with some creeping bitterness. I prefer the Evan Williams Black Label; I also prefer their White Label bottled-in-bond. In my local market, the 1783 is more expensive than both of those aforementioned bottles, and thus not even remotely worth the expenditure."

A limestone water ice cube seems to bring out some more vanilla, which is great. But don't let the ice melt too much. Good for this price point, but Very Old Barton is also this price and in my view has more flavor. 2/12/17"

3.0,"Great opening remarks from the folks at Distiller to remind us that when it comes to spirits,  the terms ""small batch"" and ""extra aged"" are even more meaningless as the guarantee at a used car lot.   I would love to see the major players like Heaven Hill cease and desist with this marketing gimmick which is more of an insult than anything to the experienced whiskey connoisseur.  Kudos to Distiller for keeping them honest and us informed.
    
    One very striking resemblance this bottle has is the similar name to a bourbon that carries some of the same esoteric aged oak notes. Coincidence or not, the bottle w/ 17__ from Barton and particularly the Very Old Barton itself have a lot in common when it comes to musty barn door oak notes.  
    
    1783 has a good bit of the standard EW Black characteristics yet adds the distinction of a ""more aged barrel"" taste, that alone at a price nearly the same as black label should be enough to warrant a try from any of the old school bourboners who enjoy the standard Evan Williams. 
    
    The nose, while a bit restrained, carries the standard sweet brown sugar with a hint of oak as the familiar EW Black, on the tongue is when you discover the inclusion of aged oak that is mostly non-existent in the standard Black.  Finish is standard Evan with a slight spice burn holding on for a moment. 
    
    At a price barely over already reasonable standard EW Black, this is an enjoyable treat and really affordable enough to be an every day drinker. Drinkable neat, with water or a mixer, the one thing Evan Williams 1783 IS NOT, is a close second to the dated Single Barrel product.  In fact it would be closer to the Green Label than the uniquely special Single Barrel striped label from Evan WIlliams. 
    
    Still this is an offering that every serious bourbon drinker can afford to and should try at least once. Extra  small batch aged or not!
    
    Cheers!"

3.5,"Evan Williams 1783 may be the best sub $15 bottle of bourbon you can easily find.  But to be honest, on the first few tastes I nearly wrote this one off because it's so different than the norm.  After  a while though, I started to warm to it and appreciate the flavors of 1783 and now it's in my rotation as a cheap daily sip.  

Enjoyed neat in a rocks glass.   On the nose I get a strong sweetness, with smells of bubble gum, cola, butter, slight florals and nuttiness with a backdrop of light oak.  First impression, this isn't a typical bourbon nose that I'm used to, kinda weird really.  Compared to EW Black and EW BiB, I wasn't expecting such a huge difference.  The sweetness here on the nose is greater than what you would typically expect, even from a wheater.

The palate confirms the nose, it's very very sweet syrup.  Sweeter than just about any other bourbon I've had, again including wheaters known for their sweetness.  At first I was very put off by it, but now most of the way through the bottle, I actually like it.  The mouthfeel is extremely thin and watery, which was again very offputting at first, but now that I’ve adjusted to it and expect it, doesn’t really bother me.  The flavors here are also in another ballpark than regular EW Black or BiB, or most any other bourbon really.  1783 gives off more melted butter, cola, cotton candy, yet is also somewhat peanutnutty, again with a backdrop of light barrel to finish up the sip.  It's honestly such a strange palate for a regular bourbon drinker, it took a while to appreciate the flavors.  There is little to no spice and burn here, it's a smooth operator.  This one would be a great starter bourbon for the non initiated because it's almost like drinking cola and certainly won't hurt you with spice or heat.  I'm used to sipping fire breathing monsters at 120 proof or others with high spiciness, so 1783 is honestly like drinking water for me.  It's a very relaxed sip and won't wake you up, but when that's what I'm in the mood for, it's just fine.  

The finish actually lingers a while with more residual light cola sweetness, light tobacco.  Once the flavors are fully absorbed on the palate, the lingering light tobacco finish is worth the wait here.  

Overall, despite being very underwhelmed and a bit disappointed initially with 1783, I can now certainly appreciate what it offers, especially at $15 a bottle.  The smoothness, sweetness, and fairly atypical bourbon profile have made this an interesting changeup in the daily rotation.  While 1783 won't be unseating any of my regular inexpensive daily favorites, like Turkey 101, Buffalo Trace, or Beam Distiller's Cut, I have gained an appreciation for the product.  I simply can't think of another sub $15 bottle I'd rather sip!  It's cheap, it's different, and I like it!  

Bourbon can be a lot like women.  Some are love at first sight and others you have to get to know better before you develop feelings.  With 1783 it took a few dates but we're good friends now!  Cheers!"

It’s not horrible, and I wouldn’t turn it down if someone offered it to me, I just won’t buy it again. Even at $17. It just has a bit too much of the acetone/ethanol taste to it to be good. I A/B’d this with standard Buffalo Trace and the BT blew it away. Like I said, it’s not horrible, it’s just fairly one dimensional and also has that slightly off-putting note. I’m very disappointed.

3.25,"I've been drinking EW since starting college, so now that I'm fully into whiskey tasting I thought I'd buy all of EW's major expressions to taste against each other. Unfortunately I didn't do this blind because I had no one to set it up. I bought the plastic 375 mL of this for $7.50. It is light and smooth. I mainly get fruit and sugary caramel on the nose and taste, and the finish is short. This is easier to drink than similarly priced EW BiB but less complex. I do love that EW Black and 1783 have 375 mL plastic bottles, because these are absolutely perfect to pick up for camping trips or outdoor concerts with no extra steps needed. I've been buying EW plastic for camping trips almost exclusively for a decade and it never fails. However, the EW BiB and Single Barrel are both better options than this, and the EW Black is pretty even. Did not try EW Green for this series."

3.0,"I didn't want to try this one, I don't like black label at all and this is supposed to be the same recipe just aged longer.  It tastes nothing like black label.  The description on this site hits it exactly.  Caramel and vanilla at first, then as you swallow, the spice hits and your left with a spicy caramel, vanilla taste that makes you want another sip. This bourbon is VERY good, and here in central AL. it's under $20."

4.0,"Carmel and Vanilla and another sweet smell that I can't put a description to. 
Taste: Very sweet on the tip of the tongue. Mild spice, camel and vanilla. Moderately oily. It holds the spice after the finish but does not hold the sweetness. Reminds me of a rye finish.  At the price of under $15 and availability it a good drinker. Would keep it a secret so it does not get price over inflated as so many whiskey have done over the last few years. Lol..."

3.5,"Considering I’m used to stronger, top shelf bourbon and scotch this wasn’t bad. It tastes pretty good it’s just not complex at all and goes down smooth as water. Tastes of leather, cherry, oak, and brown sugar."

3.75,"A simple, sweet bourbon that punches above its price range. It’s not complex, but it’s easy to sip neat or in a cocktail. 

Nose: sweet corn, with hints of buttered bread —let’s just call it cornbread. 

Palate: not creamy but not dry either, hints of citrus and tea

Finish: short, very little heat but a little clove kick"
3.5,"Sweet, thin mouth, best  on the rocks."
3.5,"Candy corn, cashew butter, butterscotch, orange zest, caramel syrup, and faint baking spices adorn the nose of this rather smooth dram.  For a cheap seat, it's something of a hidden gem:  palate full of traditional bourbon flavors, including brown sugar, vanilla, black cherries, peanut brittle, and a drying rye spice that slips into a finish of milk cocoa and lots of tobacco leaf.  Thin mouthfeel, with a medium-short finish.  However, for not a lot of dough it's a good daily sipper for someone wanting a step down from the more assertive rye punch of some of its Heaven Hill brothers."

2.5,"Nose is simple with a baking spice overtone and honeysuckle undertone. Spicy and burn on the front that drops quickly to a sweet and fast finish of cherry or peach. No punch at this low proof, but very drinkable and a fine starter bourbon."
3.5,"A sweeter, and less complex bourbon than the Evan Williams bonded, this is an approachable bourbon that beginners can pick out. Less nutty than some of Heaven Hill’s other offerings. For the money it’s hard to argue with."

4.0,Evan Williams 1783 is a really good Bourbon but at a great price. I have had this several times and I am a sucker for sub $20 Bourbon that can be had neat or mixed and not be mad. This Bourbon is so nice for the price and availability. My only real criticism is that the entire flavor profile is thin. The taste changes so quickly that none of the pleasant tastes linger in my mouth but have I mentioned that it is less than $20. I do like this Bourbon and have introduced many of my friends to it.
2.75,A little to much ethanol for my taste.
3.75,Sweet. Great for the price point

Much better than I expected for $13.  There is a surprising amount of barrel influence for such an inexpensive bourbon.  Nothing objectionable at all about this one.  It lacks complexity compared to more expensive bourbons but is very good."

4.0,"The ""expert"" rating is full of itself.  Yes, this is what you expect from a bourbon.  And since when was that a bad thing?  It's definitely a step above EW Black,  and nestled  comfortably between black and Single Barrel.  How it rates below black is truly a mystery. Definitely worth the 7 dollars extra for the 1.75l bottle."

3.25,"Was gifted a handle of this by someone who knows I like bourbon. I can't believe I haven't reviewed this one before, so...Here goes.
Nose: Peanut Brittle, Shellac, Juicy Fruit Gum, Cola, and Oak are the prominent notes I pull from my Glencairn. After some time in the glass, it develops an Herbal Note similar to a rye whiskey. 
Neat: Vanilla Coke, Oak, Mint, and a Black Pepper Tingle. Not overly complex, but solid. Dry Roasted Peanuts become more prominent the longer it's in the glass. There is some astringency, but not enough to be off-putting. There is a little bite on the finish and a nice sweet Oak and Vanilla that coats the palate.
Splash: A little water adds a touch of Citrus to both nose and palate.
Verdict: Solid and Workmanlike. A great value at between $15-$17. Decent Neat and a great mixer. I was sent a Heaven Hill survey recently with some new bottle designs for this one, and it is getting a much needed makeover with Old-Time bottle shape, Label and large cork stopper. I hope the price doesn't go up as a result. 3.25"

3.5,"I’ve had the Evan Williams Single Barrel and wanted to do a comparison since this one runs about half as much $ at the same proof.

So the 1783 is a little on the watery side in the glass, though ever so slightly darker that the Single Barrel.

The nose has cola, a little rye, roasted peanuts. With a sweet oaky vanilla note coming through. And a light corn note on further nosings.

The mouthfeel is thicker than it looks in the glass. Almost creamy.
The palate has some cola, and 
light oak notes with a little bit of peanut. There is a nice spice on the back of the palate right before you swallow.

The finish is on the shorter side of medium or longer side of short. A very slight bitterness pops up immediately after swallowing but so does the spice, which I think takes over any bitterness.
Not much lingering after about 8 seconds, but you know you just drank some whiskey. 

Overall not a bad whiskey at all, especially for the price! 

I found the Single Barrel being a little thicker, but a lot sweeter than the 1783 with a few different notes like banana that were not present in the 1783.
They’re similar but I think the 1783’s darker notes are a little more in line with what I like."

3.25,"Let breathe in the glencairn about 10-15 mins. Took a dozen breaths to see if I could taste any aroma, and I did get some vanilla notes. Half dozen sips and I enjoyed the taste with a little sweet and I wanna say nutty flavor when swallowing with a few long exhales through the nose.👍"

2.0,"The nose is incredibly sweet, like   Werther's. Not much of an ethanol smell. What little there was, is gone after a few minutes. Mildly oily, as a little hangs into the glass. 


Sweet on the lips. But that's where it ends. Taste starts off strongly medicinal. Finishes with a alcohol tingle on the sides of the tongue. Only mildly warm as it goes down."
