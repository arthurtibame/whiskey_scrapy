3.75,Mellow. Not much intensity but the flavor that is there is enjoyable. Hard to stop pouring with how easy it is to drink.

3.5,"For the low price one of the better bourbons I’ve tasted. Smooth but a little watery. Slight smoke, medium finish, caramel sweetness."

2.0,"Calling this a bourbon creates the expectation for hints of oak, vanilla, maybe caramel. They are disappointedly not there. Instead, this is a peppery, smokey, somewhat fruity tasting whiskey that is better in a mixed drink rather than a straight up sipping whiskey. Dry glass - finally the expected bourbon notes!"

3.0,"I thought this better on the rocks than in a cocktail. It didnt play well with the muddled fruit, but on the rocks, it was smooth, nice mouth feel and a bit  of a burn. This has improved as Mile High as distilled more batches, maybe better barrels; it is more complex than my first tasting two years ago"

3.0,"Light in color, almost blonde quite clear - turnoff? 

Aroma: vanilla. Little else. No oak. little burn (40%) seems pleasant and approachable. 

Taste: sweet almost candy quality. Mostly vanilla, with apple fruitiness. Finally some light wood on the release.

Overall: weekday whiskey. Not to be insulting, but sort of a starter. Might offer to someone not terribly acquainted with whiskey, is approachable and safe - nothing offensive at all. No burn, little depth. One note: friendly vanilla."

3.5,Heckin kick with smooth vanilla
2.75,"The bourbon is okay on its own. At the distillery, though, they make an old fashioned from it that is then aged in the bourbon barrel for 45 days. That barrel aged cocktail based on this bourbon is fantastic"
3.5,"vanilla, honey up front, some lime."
