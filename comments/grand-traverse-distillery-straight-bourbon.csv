3.0,"[11.23.15] Tasting houses in Michigan are the real deal for as long as they last. I caught this one at the Grand Traverse tasting house in Frankenmuth on a quiet Monday morning. Just us (first tasting w/my father-in-law) and plenty of time to talk over a $1 sip(s). 
  
  This is a strong corn bill and certainly sweet but the work these guys do with their rye helps to mellow it out. Feels very clean with subtle spices and a late-blooming oak flavor. Don't waste time watering this down or hiding it in a cocktail (especially for the price). Drink it straight on the patio and count your blessings."

2.5,Basic bourbon. Some burn on the way down. Not worth the price tag of $50/750 ml.
