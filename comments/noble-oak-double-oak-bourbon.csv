2.5,"For young Bourbon, this one isn't too bad. The Sherry influence is pronounced and tames the obvious youth. It's not bad, but not really great."

3.75,"Interesting new bourbon. Great aroma of vanilla and Oak. Extremely smooth over ice. Has a cherry, vanilla, Oak and berry flavor, with a very smooth finish. I like it a lot. One of the top bourbons I’ve tasted. Hope this stuff doesn’t sell out like Blantons or Pappi."

4.0,"Nose: More sweetness than oak. Leather is in the distance.

Taste: Very sweet. A candy sweetness that seems almost slightly artificial. The oak is very much in the background compared to the sweetness. Does not taste as young as you would expect."

2.75,"This is in the sherry-finish division of my finished bourbon bracket. It was Joseph Magnus vs Noble Oak, winner to go against Wild Turkey Revival. In a blind taste test, Joseph Magnus won. As always... this is for science.

Blind was kind of impossible. Although price doesn’t always mean better, $90 vs $30 was meaningful here. I wasn’t fooled for a second.

The oak is strong with this one. Doubled, some might say. The nose immediately lets me know what I’m getting into: heavy oak scent mixed with artificial banana flavoring. It’s reminiscent of Woodford Double Oaked in that way. Body is a hit of that same banana flavor, and the finish carries away an almost imperceptible raisin flavor, again overpowered by that artificial banana. The main recognizable sherry influence is a dry mouth feel on the finish.

For those of you who dig Woodford Doubled Oaked, this is a variant on that flavor profile at 60% the cost. I’m not convinced that banana/oak is the most compatible flavor profile for a sherry finish, but it’s interesting."

4.0,"I love this whiskey. It's hard to fool time, but they do a pretty good job of it. There's some damp wood mixed on with the vanilla and cherry notes, stone graham cracker, and butter. I've noticed that if this whiskey is served too cold, it acquires a bitter lacquer-like smell, that subsides as it warms, which can be confusing. My first experience was very positive, and when I went back the second time, all the good notes were covered up by that smell until it warmed in my hands."
