3.0,"Nice maple and cereal notes. In the mouth it is very spicy, and little undeveloped. Nice full mouth feel, maybe lingering a little long."

4.0,"Easy finish, initial taste is sweet and mapley as the name suggests, builds a little in the middle but then hits you with a sneaky smooth finish which may be anti-climatic for some."

3.0,An all-rye beverage finished in maple barrels for extra sweetness. Ok. Not my thing.

4.0,Rich and super sweet
3.25,"Not too bad, sweet yet spicy. Enjoyed on ice. Reminded me a little of Coopers Daughter. Had an odd aftertaste that I could not put my finger on, but the aftertaste did not last long. Maybe that’s why I could not put my finger on the note LOL."
4.0,"Batch 2 from 2017. Young rye with a very sweet maple and oak nose. The palette has the rye burn in the front middle, but the sweetness of the maple softens it up nice."

1.0,"Overwhelmingly cinnamon flavored, cake across spiced. Not a fan"
3.25,Honey flavors with pleasant spices.  Slightly sweeter than I prefer.
2.25,"This is the 1st batch.

This one immediately noses like a red hot with rye, sweet maple syrup, and a little green banana.

The palate has an oily mouthfeel with a lot of cinnamon, vanilla and a very astringent thing going on.

This one has a medium finish that has a continuation of cinnamon and some astringency. 

I do not like this one. I don’t mind cinnamon, but this is like artificial cinnamon flavoring. It just seems off."
4.75,I think it's quite good.  I'm no expert but I love the subtle sweetness that's there.

3.5,"didn't realize it was a rye when I ordered, answers my question as to the bite I got. maple definitely settled it down though"

3.0,The maple cuts the heat of this whiskey. Not bad for a young whiskey.
3.0,"Very impressive for a young whiskey, sweet and hides the heat."
3.75,"spicy. smells and tastes some sweet - sugar, vanilla, maple. definitely maple. not unpleasant. spicy. tastes a little empty (is not full bodied i guess)"

3.25,A tinge of sweetness. Add a drop of their bourbon barrel aged Maple syrup and it's just right.

4.0,Very smooth for a rye.  Tastes like a bourbon with just a hint of pepper corn.  Finish definitely has a nice maple sweetness to it.  I like it!

3.25,"Smells interesting and has some interesting tasting notes, but altogether tastes a bit like varnish"
