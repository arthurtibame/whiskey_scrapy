4.0,"First nose is of pecans fresh from the shell. Color is a light amber with a consistency that coats your tongue. If this was a wine I would say it has good ""legs"" for the way it coats the glass. First sip gives way to some spicy ""heat"", but not unpleasantly. Maybe a HINT of caramel and LOTS of leather, and maybe tobacco? There's a spice to it, that may mellow with time, but still VERY suitable to drink with non bourbon and bourbon drinkers alike."
