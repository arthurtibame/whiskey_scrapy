4.0,Binny's Pick; 4 yr 8mo; A-S13A2; ISC #4 Char & Toasted.
4.5,"We (my wife and I) thought this was wonderful. Strong and full flavor, but balanced. Had a nice kick, but not overwhelming. Could taste the corn, but wasn’t too sweet (like their regular single barrel bottle in bond might be). Of course every barrel is different, so tastes may vary."
3.75,"I’ve been meaning to try Wilderness Trail for a while now.  It’s a relatively new distillery, in KY, and unlike other upstarts, they actually waited 4 years to place their first bottle as a BiB.  You have to hand it to them waiting 4 years, especially considering the immense startup costs in building a new distillery.  And thanks to my buddy @dubz480 for sending over a generous pour to try.  

This is a 114 proof..I couldn’t even find that listing here, so I’m guessing @dubz480 got his hands on a special store pick.  I had this sample on my desk since Monday.  Been periodically nosing it all week.  The aroma is amazing...marshmallows and vanilla, with a side of oak.  I can just smell the aromas without drinking it, and be fully content.  The palette for me was a step down though...not for anything else, but it was simply too hot at 114.  I had to add ice, but then that muted the amazing aroma.  So, net/net...I screwed up by adding too large an ice.  With proof that high, I have a hard time balancing to get it just right.  Either way, I need to try the BiB 100proof version of this, which I’m guessing will be less hot.  

Thanks @dubz480 for the pour!"

3.75,"(This single barrel is 15E22 from Forecastle Festival in Louisville, KY on 7/12-14/19) Proofed at 111, this is ridiculously smooth for that octane. At 49 months old, this provides a lot of flavor similar to what you would expect from a wheater. It’s soft and spicy, imagine going into a bakery and enjoying the smells. Now liquify that and taste it. Glad I revisited Wilderness Trail, this is a good one!"
