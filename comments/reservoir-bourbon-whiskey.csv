2.5,One bottle was killer and the other one was straight butt. Not sure where I stand with this so I'll probably stay away from it. (Plus the bottle is a 375ml)

3.25,Given its turbo charged in small barrels it not to bad but the strong cough syrup cherry flavour not for me.

2.75,"Nose - prominent corn sweetness with a touch of spice
Taste - caramel and consolation along with the corn
Finish - significant lingering burn and the spicer notes are noticeable at the end"

4.25,Hometown bias but really enjoyed it. 100% corn adds a unique quality. Super smooth over ice - didn’t even realize it was 100 proof. Cost is a bit much but got a 375ml on sale for $30 which helped.

5.0,"this is great stuff. And has that nice fresh medicinal and Band-Aid knows when you first pop it, but that Mellows with a little bit of air and a couple of drops of water. sweet caramel right up front, and then a nice burn. this is some real worked corn whiskey. nice job."

4.0,"A little too much heat for me neat, but on rocks it’s awesome! Great nose and balance."
3.25,"100 Wheat wasn’t bad, wasn’t worth the cost. Also didn’t like a wax dip with no pull tab left a large mess."

null,"One of the more expensive bottles I have. This bourbon is made of 100% corn. The distillery also offers an 100% wheat, 100% rye, and a (much more expensive) bourbon that is aged in stout barrels from a local brewery."
4.0,A little expensive but all local to Richmond and a great atmosphere at the tasting room.

4.0,Fantastic!  Picked up a few weeks back at Phoebus ABC. A bit pricey (~$30 for 375ml).

3.25,"375ml poured neat in Glencairn at home.  Finally bought a bottle because 20% off at the VA ABC.  Dipped in wax, but no opening tab, so it was particularly annoying to open. 2019 Batch 9 Bottle 525. 

Nose is corn, oak, mild cinnamon.  Taste is more spice forward, then followed by some dry oak and corn, then finishing with some interesting basil and vanilla notes (really). OK, more interesting than good. 9/5/19"
2.5,Tanned leather.  That’s it!  Kinda gross.
3.25,Interesting nose almost leathery.  When first tasting you get a sweet pecan almost maple start.  It then ends with a spicy burn.  Its definitely a unique whiskey I wouldn't necessarily call it a bourbon though.  Something i would drink in the future but definitely not one of my go to drinks for around the house.
3.0,"Complex with great dried fruit and spice. Very young and very expensive. The cost prohibits casual drinking, but there’s also nothing really special about this whiskey with the cost considered."
2.5,"Bourbon purists are not going to enjoy this drink. First, why in heaven's name is it called bourbon? I realist 51% corn is the requirement, but 100% corn is corn whiskey. Secondly, there is nothing pleasant about the aroma of ""Band-Aid"" that other tasters have described, and I think even Band-Aids would be insulted by such a labeling. Call it what it is, an old dirty warehouse mixed full of mothballs.

All that being said, it isn't a bad whiskey, but i just refuse to call it bourbon. There is a ""caramelly"" sweetness to the palate, and on the finish you get another puff of that medicinal vegetation as it trickles down to clean your colon. Make no mistake, you have to be ""in the mood"" for Reservoir Bourbon to enjoy Reservoir Bourbon."
3.0,interesting taste. Reminds me of polished/oil leather. not bad but not something I would want to drink regularly. 79.99 @ Perfect Pour Columbia 72.99 @ Drug City Pharmacy in Dundalk
3.25,"The nose is great, taste has some burn. Got a little sweet hint in the background"
