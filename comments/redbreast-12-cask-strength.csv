3.0,"Heavier going than the standard 12yr old, definitely, but amazingly, still no burn as you swallow it, contrary to everything your mouth is telling you to start with.
A very satisfying, 'evening' drink."
4.0,"$65 - Michigan. Nose (Neat): Light alcohol, sweet vanilla, caramel, faint leather and mellow smooth smoke. Palate (Neat): First sip produces an envgorating tingle on the tongue. No burn going down...very surprising. Following sip produces sweet vanilla, caramel with a kick of spice and light rich tobacco and leather. Wow...what a mouthfull. So fragrant and flavorful it is definitely staying in my collection with a reserve bottle on hand."

5.0,"I'm going back on my original review and giving this a 5.  This stuff is perfect, and I love it!

 Amber color from the casks, perfumed nose with strong presence of cherry, and clean sweet fruits.  Over time the nose softens up and introduces a little vanilla.  Once you taste it...BOOM!  A sharp  commanding blast in the mouth.  Bolstering pot still, intense pepper, and a little sherry.  Introducing a few drops of water (but probably wasn't enough), adds more vanilla, mellow cherry, brown sugar, more pot still, and a touch of honey.  The finish is long, and it BURNS.  Oaky dried fruits afterward.  Now I've had high ABV whiskey before, and none have demanded as much of your attention as this one...for the best i would say.  I would highly recommend this to anybody who thinks that Irish whiskey is too ""basic"".  Also, bourbon lovers."

4.0,"This is quite good, but as is often the case, I am wishing for a bit less sherry influence. It's big. It reminds me of an Edradour bottling I have (single barrel, cask strength, unfiltered, 8 year), but it doesn't have the earthy depth of the peat. That said, I do like this, and I will be taking my time to know it more deeply. It should be noted, the nose is very full and round, with a nice tart spike like dried apricots. It's very pleasant."

4.0,"As I've said a few times, the standard 12 year bottling of Redbreast and I have a slightly checkered relationship. Usually, it's a reliably rich, delicious dram - not life changing, but tasty. A few times, though, I've gotten served a pour of the ol' priest's tipple (as Redbreast used to be known) that felt flat and devoid of personality. Let's just say that you're not likely to describe the Cask Strength incarnation of Redbreast as flat or insipid. This has some serious spark to it and, as you'd expect, it is everything the standard bottling, but with the volume turned way up. Buttery pastry (pie crust?), massive dried-yet-juicy fruit, slivered almond, and a goodly hit of spice show up, riding a rich, unctuous wave across your palate. I do recommend a smidgeon of water to tone down the burn from the high ABV, but just a few drops will suffice. If you enjoy single pot still Irish whiskey, this is an absolute must-try and a tremendous improvement over the standard bottling for only a trifle more for the bottle."

3.0,"Hmm this is a tough one. I loved the 12, 15 and others in this range, this one however I'm not sure about. It has the familiar rich potstill viscous honey profile with a layer of sherry coming through however the ethanol is just to strong and it tips it over to being a slightly unbalanced dram with a hint of bitterness coming through. A few drops of water didn't really help it just washed it out so maybe it was a few to many. I bought out my trusty 57% North Talisker to compare (which never a drop of water has dare defile :-)) and that was as lovely as ever which prompted me to elevate it to a 5 star rating. So it wasn't the my personal aversion to the strength which was causing the perceived imbalance it just seemed to me to be a dram which didn't tolerate such a high abv and allow the other components to hold their own. Now i have tried it twice after the Ledaig 18 so it could be that that has tainted my tasting of this. In my tasting approach high abv and peated is towards the end but perhaps peat should have come after high abv in this case. Regardless I'll give this a 3.5 and given it's a 50% price premium to the standard 12 that's a 3. Will be interested to see how this develops over time"

#2: Redbreast Cask Strength.  Single Pot Still Irish Whiskey.  57.2% ABV.  12 years old.  Batch No. B1/16
Paid $73
A little hard to find.  It’s an automatic buy when you find it.

This could’ve been $100, and still be a good purchase in today’s market, where Scottish distilleries are releasing NAS cask strength sherry matured whiskies for ~$100.  Redbreast 12 CS is not a sherry bomb, but it is still an explosion of sweet flavors that are preferable to single-minded young sherry whiskies.  This is Redbreast with spikes.  Huge, dense nose.  Lightly toasted wood, caramel, marshmellows.  Salted vanilla butterscotch with secondary sherry notes.  On the palate, this is hot, and almost too intense.  Some water mellows this out, but I have Redbreast 15 and 21 if I wanted a mellow experience.  You really want to slowly sip this thing of beauty, so your tastebuds can get accustomed to the volume.  Initially, it’s just like flavors shouting; everything is strong, but nothing stands out.  With time and acclimation, you get the richest, most viscous vanilla and caramel flavors, with a fruity acetone aftertaste that lingers.  If price were not a consideration, I prefer the Redbreast 21 year, just slightly, but that bottle is 3-4x the price of this Redbreast 12 CS, which offers incredible bang for the buck, and is one of the best whiskies I’ve tasted this year.

Redbreast is my preferred sherry profile dram now.  Their entire range is insanely good.  RB 21 year is my favorite, but the 12 year cask strength wins value for money hands down.  Exclusively sherry-aged scotches, even well-aged expressions, have become less interesting.  For the price of a Mac 18, I’ve found that I can get a 50+ year old port, madeira, or sherry; and the wine is way more decadent (although the bottle only lasts a few weeks after being opened).  

But this Redbreast is just the definition of decadence for me right now.  Sherry sweetness is at the forefront.  But the use of unmalted barley and bourbon aging gives you so much more texture.  There’s the dark rummy fruits with the freshly baked vanilla cookie, and Christmas spices.  If you want freshness or salinity, this has none.  The relatively young age and cask strength gives you some maltiness and alcohol bite.  Pretty irresistible.  I could not stretch this bottle out to Christmas.

It worked straightaway with this 116 proof delight. Definite vanilla, cherry and something else out in the background. On the tongue the same but with a cream-like sweetness. On the finish I'm getting any number of sweet fruits like peach and mango ... and even coconut well after. Delicious! Was very lucky to get this along with a 12 year Irishman from a great online dealer a few months back. Apparently now many of my closer sources in D.C. are not shipping to PA anymore, due no doubt to some ridiculous change in the law. I feel like I'm going to have to nurse some of my beautiful collection until I can secure new replenishment sources. Woe is me, LOL!  Fortunately,  at least CA online stores seem to be excellent shippers to PA, with pricing that makes cross country shipping sensible.

The influence of the cask is persistent throughout the nose with its brawny oak character appearing behind every aroma, like the framework of a half-timbered cottage. This is ""gentled"" by an underlying honey-sweetness and a hint of vanilla (and the tiniest whiff of coconut).

Palate: A commanding and rich arrival with a delightfully buttery, oily texture. Sweet cereal grains in the beginning developing flavours of raisins and sultanas soaked in golden syrup. Oranges (both sweet fresh fruit and a little marmalade), marzipan and barley sugar sweetness appear as it develops in the glass (and a dash of water amplifies this).

Finish: Medium/long. A lingering sweet fruity-cereal aftertaste.

There is a hint of rye or bourbon about this nose, but it's unquestionably an Irish character, and specifically Midleton. The palate is more obviously Irish cereal/fruit. The more I taste from this distillery the more I respect it.

This is also a whiskey that responds spectacularly well to water. Neat it is powerful but gentle, just as you would expect from a cask-strength Irish whiskey, however water does it no harm at all, morphing it into a softer and less challenging character. (I split my tasting dram and added water to one half, then compared the two samples over the space of 20 minutes. They were equally delicious).

On the nose, water transmutes the oak presence slightly into a more aromatic sandalwood and camphorwood character. Lovely! On the palate water dampens the intensity of the high proof and allows the soft dusky heart to emerge.

Delightful whisky. It's the standard 12 year old Redbreast turned up to 12 and it approaches the 5-star level of the 21 year old expression. It was the standout of the evening's tasting.

""Excellent"" : 4.5 stars."

5.0,"Nose:  Oatmeal cinnamon cookies!  A little candied orange peel accompanies a slight alcohol bite.  Dark red plums, cherries, and even some sweet raspberries.  Another interesting red fruit pops out - strawberries, but more like fresh ripe strawberries rather than the stewed fruits I'd expect.  Nice vanilla and spice on the end, specifically clove and cardamom - another rarity.  Somehow reminds me of vanilla cake batter as well.

Palate:  Spice and oily sweetness!  Cinnamon, clove, maple?  Small amount of other spices as well - anise and nutmeg.  Sweet fruit syrup and wildflower honey.  Warm, buttery maltiness that keeps coming in waves, slightly changed each time.  Tingling on the middle of the tongue.  Is that even some milk chocolate?

Finish: Long and mouthwatering!  This lasts and lasts.  That initial spice oatmeal cookie note is prominent in the finish as well, continually coming back between waves of baked cinnamon peaches and vanilla oak.

Adding water dulls the spices quite a bit and brings out much more vanilla and honey scents along with more fresh orange zest.  It feels much thicker and sweeter at first, though the spices are actually more obvious on the taste than before, contrary to what the nose suggests.  Much more like sweet sugar cookies with a dusting of cinnamon and some light raisins.  Still lasts and lasts though - wonderful. 

Conclusion:  Wow!  Absolutely stunning... This is one of the best whiskies I've ever poured.  The original Redbreast 12 is my go to answer for when anyone asks what my favorite whiskey is, but this cask strength has just taken that spot."

4.25,"Warming. Still had that great Redbreast 12 flavor, just more intense."
4.75,"I thought it high time I did another head to head tasting. This time around I'll be reviewing the four widely available expressions from Redbreast: the 12 year, 15 year, Lustau edition, and the 12 year Cask Strength (CS). I'd love to include the 21 year in this lineup but my wallet can't handle that sort of hit. If any of you fine folks would be willing to send a sample it'd be most appreciated. I'm also curious as to your opinions on my rankings and whether or not you'd rate these differently. Redbreast is one of my favorite whiskey brands and any of their expressions are worth having in your collection.

My previous review for this expression holds up. It comes in just shy of the standard 12 year just because the standard 12 is so easy to drink. This is definitely worth the money for just a few more $$, though, and if you can find it, well worth your hard earned cash.

For today's tasting I'm rating this #2  out of 4."

4.75,"Delicious. Everyone here reading this has probably either tried the standard Redbreast 12 or heard its virtues extolled by others on this site and beyond. It is the quintessential Irish whiskey in my opinion. What Middleton has done here is presented that form of perfection in its full unadulterated cask strength glory. 

The initial nose comes bellowing out of the glass with the ethanol (something more associated with CS bourbons or Islay whiskies than Irish!). This one had to sit for a while while I nosed and contemplated it. All the shortbread biscuit and sherry notes are there but they’re dialed WAY up to 11 on this edition. I took a sip and let it sit on my palate for a bit and came back 20 minutes later, which helped tone down the ethanol. From there only happiness ensued. 

One of the fun things about CS whiskies is that you essentially get to pick your proof. I played a little game with myself, adding a splash of water every two or three sips until I found a comfortable drinking proof (which in hindsight I suspect was close to the standard Redbreast 12’s 40%). That took about three splashes of water (a most technical and academic of terms) to bring it down compared to my usual one. The dram was still complex and delicious at every stage but I feel that it achieved maximum “drinkability” after more water than usual. If you get the CS version you can try for yourself. Good news is I still have most of a bottle left to continue dialing in my ideal amount. 

Where I live this edition cost about $17 more than the standard 12 for the cask strength. Most worth it in my opinion. Redbreast 12 has been one of my favorites since I first tried it, and this edition allows me to experience it in the most personalized and optimal way possible. Highest marks!"

Taste: Jam on toast, fruit, heat and baking spices with a wood finish. 

Experience: A picnic. It is a nice day the sun is out but it isn't hot and the breeze is perfect, you pack up some unsalted butter, fresh soda bread or biscuits, some jams and cheeses and a bottle of sherry. Mix it all together and you'll have a grand time, just like with this whiskey."

4.0,"Re-review at bottle kill.

Purchased: March 17, 2019
Bottle Kill: February 2, 2020

I'm almost embarrassed at how long it took me to finish this, but I really just couldn't get into the idea of cask strength Redbreast after a while. Every time I drank this I found myself not enjoying it very much, and diluting it down to the point where it was pretty much the standard 40% Redbreast 12. Eventually, I just proofed down the entire bottle, which made it go much faster, but then I wonder why I paid the extra $20 for the CS version. Perhaps I got a dud batch, but I think next time I go a-hunting for Irish whiskey, I'll go back to the old standard Redbreast 12. Cheers all."

4.5,"Nose-buttered biscuits with honey, apricots, banana, raspberries, vanilla and spice

Palate- honey, canned pears, cinnamon covered apples, hint of oak and maybe even some dark roasted coffee

Finish- Long, creamy finish with notes of spice

Absolutely delicious and very complex. Here I thought Redbreast couldn’t get any better... and then comes along the Cask Strength. Great balance of sweet and savory. Nose is fantastic- like a bouquet of fruits. Palate is complex and tasty, with a finish that lingers for a good while. Could drink this one all day"

4.75,"Consistently beats out the Redbreast 21 and all the other Irish whiskies in my collection. The extra abv helps, but it's also the most balanced, nearly as complex as the 21, and ultimately the one Irish I'd reach for more than any others (except possibly Green Spot). 
For the money, this is a no brainer."

This was my favorite purchased Irish whiskey bottle.

N(4.5): let’s you know this is cask strength. After some time of appreciating it, I got dried apricots on the right nostril, floral, honey coat. Tropical fruit. 
P(5): OMG. Complex and beautiful. Fresh sweet fruit melody And a spice combo. The mouth feel....wow. Wow. 
F(5): spice coating that evolves to vanilla fruit melody. Nice hug. Mild oak.  Spices. Let’s you know it’s aged beautifully but not too long. 

Giving it a 5 because of uniqueness, value, and frankly best whiskey I had to date. My senses demanded another pour."

4.75,"Redbreast 12 Cask Strength is really, really good. I was expecting it to be Redbreast 12 in flavor, but on steroids so to speak. That is somewhat true. It pours a darker amber and the nosing is much like an intense regular Redbreast 12—but, different. This difference really shows in the mouth. It now becomes a Redbreast with a nuttiness and a hint of chocolate I didn't get at the lower proof. The sherry fruit tones are more powerful as well. A pleasant surprise is that this comes across smoother than a dram that is nearly 120 proof. I do think this is better than the 12 regular 80 proof. The rub is: how much is that worth? Where I live the cask strength is nearly double the price. If you can get it for $10-20 more, you should go for it"

2.0,"B2/19

Nose - vanilla, custard, pie, i get a hint of grape fruit but such a sweet profile over all. Maybe some toasted oak as well.

Taste - There's a lot of oak in here. It then moves to a sweet fruity and caramel dessert and then white grape fruit and oak on the finish, long, bitter, lingering but more like an IPA bitter, not an oak astringent or off putting one. 

Wow - this is nothing of the over the top sweet but nicely toasted oak balanced bottle I had last. I'm less excited with this one. I love the lingering and really cool finish. But I'm so jarred expecting the reach sweet red breast 12 I came to love in CS.

Perhaps with the new packaging they felt it was time for a change and with the new NAS coming...well blah. 

Anyway this is a cool whisky but it's just nothing like what I have had on past batches. For me this is a 2.0. The older bottles I've had would be 3.0+'s"

4.75,"Hands down my favourite Irish Whiskey of all time. Loved the standard Redbreast 12 y.o when I tried it in Dublin about a year ago.
Nose: Exceptionally sweet aroma of sultanas, dates, fig and pear. Slightly sherry-esque. Vanilla notes with slight spice appreciable.
Palate: There it is: that trademark Redbreast oiliness I remember, except the richness and body intensified in a Cask Strength level. The fruitiness shines here - stewed pear, tinned peach and event hints of butterscotch cookie.
Finish: the oaky malt of the barrell kicks in here... with the sweet prolongee caramel lingering with hints of sweet pear. A heartwarmingly long finish, a dram to truly savour."

4.5,Sweet raisin on the nose and a chocolate raisin with cherry on the taste. The finish is medium with some light spice.
4.0,"Nose: initially heavy on the earthy notes with the malt, fresh nuts and sharp wood/peper spice. Then it becomes more dried fruit and baking soda or salt (not brine) akin to dry sherry. 

Palate: far too complex for my Palate to pick out the distict notes at the moment. Feels like it moves a lot in the baking spice spectrum, initial salty candy, cinnamon and brown sugar, then some anis followed by the alcohol burn, then leaves behind more salty hard candy, and faint banana liquor.

Finish: medium length with some wood tannis lingering in the throat. Sweet baking spice on the tongue.

I think this one is far to complex for me to pick apart on the initial glass. Looking forward to coming back to this several times and finding more in it."

Honey color. Nose has intense notes of sweet red apples, orange zest, vanilla cream, honey and burnt sugar. Rich, oily mouthfeel. Palate brings more vanilla and burnt sugar, butterscotch, dried fruits like raisins and goji berries, and hints of spicy oak. Finish is long and peppery, with lots of influence from the sherry casks, more dried fruits and oak. An exceptional pour and incredibly easy to drink for cask strength."

4.5,Cask strength Irish are not overly common. Nose of this conjures thoughts of sweet dried fruit. As you take a sip you you get a little of the dried fruit and cinnamon before being drawn into an overshadowing mango habanero burn that lingers for a decent length. Overall quite an enjoyable glass.
4.5,"Nose - so many different fruits, orange, apricot, grape, cherry, a bit floral, vanilla, muted chocolate, sweet cinnamon, very little alcohol for being 110+ proof. 

Taste - mouth watering juicy fruit flavors, sweet shortbread, candied orange slices dipped in chocolate, soda effervescence, very little burn (disguises itself as sweet cinnamon), finishing with rich dark chocolate and fruit on the tongue."
