3.0,"The nose is that of a young bourbon, which is odd, because 6 years isn't necessarily that young. However, I think it's more of a fresh grain, with just a bit of fruit and a tiny bit of sour tang, on top of a small amount of charred barrel scent. The taste is very young grain, wheat prominent, with a citrus chocolate flavor, leaning more towards chocolate when air is introduced. Almost 100% no finish present, other than some barrel finish, but that's more taste than an actual spice in the mouth.

Always love fellow military members (seems safe to assume this distillery is likely veteran heavy), and the packaging is shockingly familiar, but this one isn't all that for me. Looking forward to returning to the distillery, this time when it's open, to try all the other products."

2.75,"Nose is typical bourbon, caramel and wood.  The palate was a strange flavor difficult to categorize, not good for me, sour fruit and bitter.  The finish is medium, wood and spice.  This is a 6 year wheated and I also tried the 2 yr that had rye in the mash and preferred that to this one.  HT is a cool place, worth a visit and to try a flight of their offerings."

Dec. 23

This bottle has officially relieved a lot of my bourbon anxiety. For one, “Ready-To-Drink” still doesn’t mean premixed liqueur bull crap. Still very happy about that. Equally important to me: this is Bravo, one of my favorite surprise finds of 2018. When Bravo disappeared from all the shelves in my area, I panicked. But I’m good now. Found my Bravo juice again in this little guy. Let’s see if my tastes have changed.

The nose is tropical, both sweet and fruity.  Watermelon, orange, but of red apple. Freaking good.

Body has a buttery feel, with that same intense watermelon flavor I recall from Bravo. The red apple and orange are also there, but watermelon is the main takeaway.

You could argue there’s some sugar on the finish, but it’s more honest to say this one lacks any real finish. I don’t view that as a true knock, because I also like watermelon popsicles, and they don’t have a finish. Point is: I love the flavors this one delivers so much, I’ll overlook the noticeable lack of complexity. If you missed out on Bravo packaging, you should make sure to give this little guy a chance.

‘Tis the season. I don’t know if I actually have 8 more new whiskeys lined up, so if you’re reading this and there’s something readily available out there you’d like me to enjoy/suffer through this holiday season, leave it in the comments."
