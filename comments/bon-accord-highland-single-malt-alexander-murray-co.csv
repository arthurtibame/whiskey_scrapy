3.75,Very smokey with slight citrus and honey
2.0,"A lot of funk on the nose- malty. Lots of honey notes, but smells a little sharp. Flavors aren’t as rounded as I’d like but still light and fruity. 

Taste is slightly Smokey with a bite. Followed by all the sweet honey notes and a crisp spice. 

As it sits and your pallet adjusts, a warm vanilla comes in with some oily nutty flavor. 

Overall not bad. Not great."
2.75,"Color is a light amber. Nose is earthy and malty initially. Light fruit notes follow. First sip is earthy, barely any sweetness. A light biscuity note follows. In the background a faint note of fruit is presents. Finish is relatively short, a brief extension of the earthiness from the front. For the price, not terrible."
