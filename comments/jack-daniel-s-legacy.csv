2.5,"The good thing is that there is no alcohol in the nose, but the bad thing that there is nothing common with classic version of jack Daniels (not such caramel and vanilla as number 7). We have got average bourbon."
4.5,"Surely fun bottle to have, but it shows that even slightly higher strength doesn't do much good to the classic."

3.0,"Surprisingly mellow and a friendly fellow. This good old boy will shake your hand to start and leave you feeling fine and just a little giddy before you know it, like a good friend."
