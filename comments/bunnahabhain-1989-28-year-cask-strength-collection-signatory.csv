4.5,"Color: Burnt gold.
Nose: Citrus. Wood. Herbal/earthy/vegetal. Medicinal, slightly. It smells like some kind of workshop, but I’m not sure what goes on there. There a scent of a nut that’s had something done to it, but I’m not familiar enough with what people do to nuts to know what.
Taste: Warm, spicy, peat. Thick/oily. Ginger. Some malt, you know it’s there but the other flavors speak more loudly. There’s a nutty transition into the finish.
Finish: Long, spicy oak. Traces of the palate."
