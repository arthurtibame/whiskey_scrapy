4.0,"I actually prefer the 15yo over the 16yo offering. Granted my tastes run more towards the fruity end of the spectrum, but I find the 15 is much full flavored though both are eminently drinkable neat."
4.25,"Nose : Fruity, but a little exotic. Vanilla, banana, orange, pear are the stars, but there is also mango and pineapple.

Taste : The exotic  fruits are still there, but they are hidden a bit by the malt. The sweetness of wine is felt after a bit.

Finish : A little more intense than the taste, it is lengthy and tasty. The wine cask finish is seen here, as it is quite dry in the end."

4.0,"N: Coffee, apples, nuttiness, a wisp of cigar smoke.

P: Green apples, berries, toffee, melon, mild black pepper.

F: Tart frutiness, a little bitter almond.

Very tasty, but not quite on par with Irishman 12 and nearly twice the cost."
3.75,From Pete Suchecki. Soft!
