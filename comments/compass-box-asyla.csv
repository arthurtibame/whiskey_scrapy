4.0,"I don't know why, but when I had this, I kept having Jimmy Cliff's lyrics on my mind----"" I can see clearly now, the rain is gone, and it's a sunshiny day"".  This blend was so light and fruity, so summery...so lemon-y/orange-y/sunshine-y.  I loved it.  I'm a huge fan of John Glaser's creations, and this was right up there with my favorites from Compass Box.  It's dangerously drinkable.  If you're not careful, you just might end up singing Jimmy Cliff's song, butt naked, bare chested (or bare breasted...whichever) in the middle of someone's living room.  (note: just for the record...I've not done that)"

2.0,Disappointment is driven by expectations. I'd put aside my prejudices about blends as Compass Boxes reputation was going to transcend those however I also realised the collective wisdom on this site was this isn't a great whisky or at least one of the least favorite of the selection. Still despite my tempered expectations it didn't even live up to those. My prejudices were unfortunately realised in trying the 50ml sample in the gift pack. Nothing going on. Literally nothing but thin sweetness. To be fair I trend towards the intense flavour profile. Sherry bombs the peatiest Islay...but still I'm searching for anything. Maybe if I try this after not drinking a few beers and the sample has been opened a while it'll improve but I have a feeling it'll be struggling to jump a star.

null,"Nose: Lemon, lime, grapes.  Very fruity, and sweet.

Taste: Reminds me of a white wine that isn’t too sweet, maybe a Sauvignon Blanc.  Slightly floral.

Finish: Surprisingly long for how light this comes across.  Leaves a tingle in the mouth but no real burn or warmth in the chest."
3.0,"Review from Barreled from November 2016

Part one of the Compass Box Whisky sampler pack reviews. 

As are all CBW whiskies, this is natural color and non chill filtered.  This blend is 40% ABV. 

This NAS is a blend of 50% Lowland single grain, 40% Highland single malt and 10% Speyside single malt. Which distilleries, I'm not sure. All aged in first full American oak ex-bourbon casks. 

Based on the color, which is a pale straw, I would guess this is a very young whisky that was aged in very lightly charred casks, otherwise the first fill wood would have had a greater influence on the color. 

The nose is very light and fruity up front. Pears, green grapes and strawberries. First time I've ever nosed strawberries and it was a nice experience. Floral notes after the fruit. Once it sits in the glass the fruit starts to fade and the bourbon oak starts to dominate. Vanilla and bourbon sweetness, but still very light. 

The palate is just as light as the nose. Soft vanilla, light oak spices and bourbon caramel sweetness. The mouthfeel is very creamy. The ex-bourbon casks really shows its influence the longer it sits. 

The finish is quite short but very clean. Sweet but restrained with some light peppery oak. 

John Glaser called this a Sunday afternoon or a before dinner whisky and I couldn't agree more. Very light and well balanced. Perfect for the scotch novice or experienced whisky fan who is looking for something light to relax with. 3.5"

I had no prior knowledge of this stuff , hell - she could have been as face assaulting as Laphroaig for all I knew- but it was good! Good enough to grab another pour at $11- Reminds me of Macallan 12 with less sherry sweetness"

4.0,3.8 stars... rounded up. Two words best describe this blend. Smooth and friendly. It’s Very well balanced but also light too. Reminds me a bit of Japanese blends. Basically white wine of scotch... very nice but not a lot of depth or complexity. Good beginner scotch... my wife likes it and she normally can’t stand whiskey.

3.0,"Nose: Brisk and fruity with a waxy edge balanced by icing sugar. Citrus, cereal grains, pears, peaches, melon and apple. There is the faintest note of smoke with a breezy maritime character [This is more noticeable on the dry glass aroma, which is waxy-honeyed and lightly smoky].

Palate: The arrival is all malt and gristy cereal with orange citrus zest notes.
As it develops some grassy and orchard fruit flavours come to the front together with barley sugar. There is also a slight tannic waxiness that adds a firm edge to the palate, but it is balanced by yeasty sweetness.

Finish: Short. Malty cereal flavours that fall away quickly. A very, very slight smoke on the aftertaste.

The best description I can think of for this whisky is ""sweetly delicious cereal"". Fruit and untoasted grain is the main presence – citrus, pears, peaches, rice flakes. It veers towards being too sweet but is held back by a the light tannic quality.

There is an unmistakable presence of Teaninich malt in this blend and the grain whisky component is very fine, as is the oak influence. It has a lot of subtle things going on behind the simple facade that are easy to miss. It certainly stands up to neat tasting.

""Above Average"" : 3 stars"
2.0,"From Compass Box sample box containing five different 50mL vials from their “core range.”  I was able to get this on sale for $30.  Asyla is the cheapest of the samples, at ~$45 per 750mL bottle.  This is a blended Scotch that is 50% grain and 50% malt from Glen Elgin, Teannich, and Linkwood

NOSE: Crisp and refreshing.  Lime, lemon, lemongrass, bittersweet… tequila?  Getting back on track with deeper sniffs, a wee bit of saltiness, roses, and earl gray tea from linkwood.  The fruitiness is all apples, which blends in with the grassiness from Teannich.

PALATE: Pleasantly waxy mouthfeel.  Vanilla dominates in two respects: it’s the vanilla flavor, and it’s vanilla, i.e. boring.  There is some corn sweetness, but it’s not as bad as the popular blends.  I can taste the worst ingredient better than most, and it distracts me.  The worst ingredient in Asyla is better than that in JW Red/Black/Green, for sure.  Still, it’s thin, it’s grassiness mixed with vanilla mixed with maltiness.  These are just boring flavors.  Linkwood – the best component of the nose, is absent on the palate.  I’m thinking that I should just gulp this and move on.

FINISH: Generic.  It’s pleasant and lasts somewhat longer than cheaper single malts such as Glenlivet and Glenfiddich 12.  There’s some maltiness, apple fruitiness, vanilla, and caramel toffees.  I’m pleasantly surprised that none of the unpalatable notes from young, cheap grain are present.

WITH WATER: Surprisingly, a few drops of water adds some much needed spicy intensity to this boring dram.  Even though this is only 40% ABV, some water makes it more interesting.

VERDICT: This is glorified white wine.  John Glasser even compares this to white wine.  You either drink this on a hot day with ditzy people who are only tolerable with alcohol, or you must find complementary foods.  May I recommend a rich white-meated fish such as cod.  This is perhaps the most boring Compass Box.  MARK: 69/100."
3.0,"Delicate comes to mind. There is a lot of forward sweetness, think toffee and vanilla, and a finishing spice that just hits the back of your throat...pink peppercorn-esque."
3.0,Geekfest 8. Paired with Hedonism. Asyla was light and fruity and surprisingly wonderful.

4.75,"I don’t know if there’s such a thing as perfection, but this is as close as it gets. It hits all my personal favorite notes. Rich, warm, vanilla, fresh fruit, and floral.

3.5,"Sweet hickory or mesquite nose. Almost like cured meats or even a brie cheese. Strong sharp burn, at first reminds of fresh grass or even herbs. Nice, even citrus peat finish. Got much sweeter after letting sit for a while."
4.0,"Nose: Strawberry preserves. I have never smelled strawberries on a whisky before, but there it is. Wow. Slightest hint of the crisp toast you’d put the preserves on

Taste: arrival is ridiculously creamy and sweet. It’s honestly vanilla pudding. Dang. Then, mid palate to finish is a really subtle cinnamon. 

This is gorgeous. It has changed as the bottle level went down. So delicious."
3.75,"Oily orange, dried banana, brown sugar, and coconut oil drizzled on Cheerios. 

Nothing too bold. All subtle."
2.75,"Totally uninteresting. The nose promises a lot of things that cant be deliver by its ""grainy"" palate and its non-existent finish. 

Actually its story is a nice one (maybe the best thing of this whisky), Asyla is the plural of Asylum. What Compass box claims to be doing here is to create a ""everyday"" ""sunday afternoon"" whisky. They might just deliver that by making a very light super delicate whisky. 

Bottled at 40%abv,  pale straw color.

On the nose is fairly nice. Very sweet and fruity. Creamy very creamy vanilla, Milk white chocolate.
Waving the glencairn and evaporating the dram a little bit strips de vanilla notes to enter the citric fruit notes: Lemon peel and cheap lemon freshener for cars. Coffee notes also and Orange note.

On the palate, it is overly influenced by the grain whisky. Water is the first flavor (or is that not a flavor?) Spicy ginger, Very light dram. Grassy grain slightly cream.
Much too light. It doesn't have the character or the personality to even be called a whisky. 

Aftertaste is non-existing. There is a very very very very very slight dim spice but it is nothing. 

I didn't pour water into it as it says in the compass box website, i now believe that one drop would turn it into simple water. 

Overall my score system was benevolent with it because of a good nose, 56 over 100, and i am not been harsh here."
3.75,"Nose: Lemon tart, strawberries and cream, a hint of shoe polish and there's a really nice hint of campfire smoke that wafts in and out.
Palate: Great creamy, waxy and  viscous entry, vanilla custard and malt appear next.
Finish: shortish with subtle vanilla, malt and smoke."
4.25,"Very friendly and approachable, like a really sweet and floral Speyside. 

Nose - floral with vanilla, lemon, apple, and a tiny hint of barrel spice 
Taste - sweet vanilla cream, with a bit of lemon zest and some rose water
Finish - the spice finally comes to the surface, mixed with a dry sweetness, lingers for awhile considering how light the whiskey is."

3.5,"A delicate, floral nose, with pears, apple juice, a little waxy and just a hint of smoke. The palate is rather creamy but doesn’t bring too much more to the table, vanilla, pickle juice brine, very clean. Rather short finish of malt, the grain finally making an appearance and just a little hot for the ABV."

3.5,the most delicate whiskey I've ever tasted.  Floral and sweet but not overwhelming.  Definitely an everyday drink or good palate starter for more complex scotch
3.25,Interested why the disparity of the expert vs. laymen score exists. Wasn’t impressed. Seemed overly mild and simple. Maybe I should try again.
4.0,"Fancy, elegant and gentle. Pure example of how all the blended whiskies should be done.
To the nose: peanut or even a peanut butter, nutshell, vanilla, light and sweet cream, anise, apples, halva and fudge. Perfume-alike.
On a palate: very rich and very sweet, “tasty”, vanilla again, honey or a honey cake, some nuts, coconut, a little bit of tropical fruits on the background. It’s  light and gentle with a clear note of a creamy strudel cake with a castor sugar as a topping.
Finish is really smooth, delicate, evenly broadening in all directions. A bit watery and sweet with a spicy note. Some tropical fruits again along with a fresh floral/grassy theme.
If judging by the first impression it might not seem extraordinary. It’s not blazing all the guns all over right from the start but it evenly expresses its unique form in right proportion during the further exploring.
It seems to be kinda modest or tense at first sight but then it reveals its rich, creamy and elegant nature in an intelligent way maintaining the balance all the way through with dignity.
Asyla is precisely acknowledged with its strong sides and it is able to impress you in various ways. This is what makes it so special."
