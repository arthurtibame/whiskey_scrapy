3.0,Vegetal on the nose and palate with strong peat. Thought would have mellowed with age but others may like this more . Adding a a few drops opens it up nicely but loses complexity. Still a good dram but not so much for the price

3.0,"As a Peat lover, I was curious to taste something from Coal Ila. At a mini-tasting, my cousin let me try and blind tast the 18 year old, along with the Kilchoman Long Gorm, and the Ardbeg 10. Knowing the Ardbeg already , it was quite easy to deduct which one was the Coal Ila: the youth of the Kilchoman showed through quite obviously (see also it’s own review soon). The Coal Ila 18 was a fine dram, but to be honest, I was a bit disappointed by the modest amount of smoke. Again, not a bad whisky, but I guess the long maturation subdues a bit of the character I expected. Perhaps the 12 year old holds up a bit better?"

Aroma: Dry seaweed, walnut wine, and salted chocolate.

Palate: Dry chocolate, smoldering peat, olive oil, and salt. Adding a few drops of water brings some nice sweet malt and moistens the peat.

Not the most mind bending Caol Ila but very satisfying."

4.0,"Lightly peated, with cooked fruit and pipe tobacco notes on the nose. Sweet, smoky and slightly herbaceous notes on the palate despite a weak mouthful. Fairly long and spicy finish. Overall a balanced whisky, but not a remarkable one for me."
4.0,"A very nice whisky, but not flawless. It starts off in a fragile way, with a delicate bouquet of peat. The palate is complex, with notes of black tea and lemon zest, with the occasional burst of salt and freshly ground pepper. It's quite nice, as it transitions into a finish that is long. It's bitter in the end, and that takes away from the overall pleasure. Still good."
4.25,"Caol Ila (based on the 12 and Moch) hasn't been a distillery that's overly excited me. Good but not top of the Islay pile personally. From vague memory the 18 is similar to the 12 but I think I like it more..not sure why maybe passage of time. Warm gentle peat balanced with sweet vanilla, lovely gentle finish. Definitely in the low to mid 4 range. $130 USD is fair for its age especially given it's an Islay malt. Whilst I could easily drink my way through a bottle in a blink of an eye as its very good and approachable it's still not one that excites me or blows me away"

3.75,"30-35 ppm phenols. Aged in refill ex-bourbon casks. 

Aroma: smoky with a bit of brine/seaweed, flint, light vanilla, fennel, and sandalwood (or some kind of woody incense)

Palate: Woody, ginger, vanilla, light fruit, oily

Finish: a minimal finish with wood and a hint of ginger and pepper

Overall: subtle (for a smoky scotch), with water the spicy notes are more noticeable from the palate through the finish (but being very light do not add more than a few drops of water)"

5.0,"Another update from my trip to Scotland, I tried this dram at Amber bar at the Scotch Whisky Experience in Edinburgh.  Caol Ila 18 is a delight.  Despite my love of Laphroaig, Lagavulin, and Ardbeg, one of the ironies of this trip was that Caol Ila was the biggest revelation from going to Scotland, even without visiting the actual distillery.  I tried several Caol Ilas that just knocked me out, including this one but also the Caol Ila Distillers Edition (and you know a distillery's good when their distillers edition actually is worth drinking).  I've realized that Caol Ila, which has fewer standout flavors in its youthful incarnations, matures really well and perhaps better than its more famous cousins.  This 18-year old whisky starts off with scents of smoke and aged, buttery malt, before transitioning to a sweeter and fruitier palate than expected (marshmallow, lemon, toffee, peat).  The finish is signature Caol Ila and remains robust, with flavors of tar and smoky peat for days.  For some reason, Caol Ila has become a little harder to find in the States in the last year or so; perhaps a lot of people are coming to the same realization that I made on this trip."

3.25,"Hovering above the glass, a delicate peat smoke really lets the essence of Islay shine through. A soft ocean breeze is mixed with farmland scents of fresh cut hay and nearby livestock. Descending further, the malt predominates accompanied by honeyed vanilla and a swirl of fruitiness. Very pleased to this point, a spin of the glass and its light gold spirit reveals viscous, hard forming legs. Wow, the ferry is pulling into Port Askaig, and I can’t wait to disembark into the arms of the Caol Ila distillery only furlongs away. The first taste of sweet vanilla, however, is suddenly interrupted by a loud crash into a nearby reef. The welcoming shore beckons, yet here we are manning the lifeboats for what will be a harsh and bitter finish to an otherwise pleasant journey now peppered in disappointment. Already watered to 43% ABV, I didn’t bother to know what more would bring. Dismayed, I pulled out Jim Murray’s Whiskey Bible only to see a meager rating of 80 for the 18yo; whereas, he rated the 30yo at 96.5. I remember liking a bottle of Caol Ila 12yo many moons ago, so I’m glad this was only a sample from the Whisky Exchange. An excellent nose marks this one at 3.25 stars."

4.75,Without a doubt my nr 1 whisky
4.25,"Nose: A soft and retiring sort of smoke. Woody, a little resinous, creamy and buttery. There's an aromatic herbal touch about it almost like a very piney gin, and a grassy, earthy sweetness that reminds me of a quiet sunny day in a farmyard. The longer it sits, the more voluptuous it becomes. A very good nose with a micro-hint of the sea. [The dry-glass aroma is a soft floral fragrance - where did that come from?!?]

Palate: A faintly sweet and slightly smoky entry. Grassy notes, like the nose, with a trace of oak and peat, but the peat never veers towards plastic. There's a malty character underneath everything and a touch of sweet citrus. A sooty, mineral-like smoke is blown about.

Finish: Medium. Sweet smoky notes trail off into an aftertaste of lemon liqueur and tea.

There's nothing bold, brash or hurried about this malt - in fact it may even seem unexciting. The younger sibling Caol Ila 12 year old is an excellent peated malt and much more forward, but this expression shows the distillery character in its elegant, calm maturity. The peat-reek is gentle and refined and never shows an inkling of plastic or rubbery notes (at least not when neat) and there is overall balance. I could happily sip a glass of this all afternoon.

The texture is just slightly to the oily side of neutral, and is (I suspect) the thing that some people may find a foundation fault. This is not a highly textured malt and that may make it seem thin.  If you approach this with the expectation that it will have a lean character then you'll probably enjoy it more than if you're expecting an oily peat monster.

Don't add any water - it is delightfully balanced when neat and any amount of water upsets that. Water unleashes bitter oils and the only hint of plastic notes that I encountered.

It's a very good whisky indeed, but arguably just a littel overpriced. For the same money there are other excellent malts, and at half the price the Caol Ila 12 year old is stunning value.

""Very Good"" : 4.25 stars."

5.0,"After reading @LeeEvolved ‘s review of this, I simply had to open up the sample he graciously sent me.  I should end this review with simply three words: Oh. My. God.  But I’ll write a bit more.  Light beach bonfire on the nose; followed by burnt wood, salinity, and charred lemons. I totally agree with Lee—-better than HP 18, or Talisker 18.  Why the hell do we bother with other crap whiskey when a few of the classics such as this, Ardbeg 10, Springbank 10, and Lagavulin 16 suffice ?  Quite simply—-it’s excellent, and at the price of"
5.0,"The collector in me was attempting to slowly put together a nice, full set of the core range of Caol Ila malts over the last year or so.  I’ve spent quite a bit of money on the higher end bottles, 25, 30 and 35 year old.  I saw this 18 year online and laughted to myself when I saw the price:  $84.  What a solid deal, I thought.  They priced this in line with Talisker.  Cool.

Well, I decided to open this bottle one night a few weeks ago just out of sheer curiosity.  That and the fact I bought a second bottle recently- you don’t just bust up a core range set on a whim, y’know.  Boy oh boy, was that a good decision...

This Caol Ila should not be confused with the annual, limited release version that is made from unpeated malt.  This is the true, core range peated 18:  it’s bottled at 43% and has added color and filtration.  This particular bottle was filled in 2008.  It’s a beautiful sunset gold and appears very oily, with thin and fast running legs and heavy, watery droplets in the taster.

The nose begins with a soft smoke- of the BBQ’d meat variety.  There’s a heavenly blast of juicy, orchard fruits that seems to be stewing in a pan of sherry wine.  There’s a hint of salty, seaside air billowing out of the glass as well.  None of these notes overpower each other- in fact, they seem to be perfectly polite and allow each other their time to shine.  Please sit with this whisky for awhile and let it work it’s magic because it’s very rewarding.

The palate starts out very sweet.  Apples, pears and the like roll across the tongue, followed by some rich peat smoke.  Orange marmalade and light citrus begin to cut through the smoke and thick mouthfeel just in time to leave you tasting juicy, fresh-picked berries that have been dipped in sea salt.  The smoke appears again to keep things from turning too tart and dry.  This is the most pleasing aspect of this dram.  It’s wonderful.

The finish combines everything you’ve experienced so far:  sherry sweetness, orchard fruits and smoke.  The tail end shows hints of menthol before leaving behind a light, peppery bite.

Overall, this malt cracked my Top 3 of all time.  I went in expecting a solid dram and came away being absolutely stunned by this bottle.  I even opened the Caol Ila 25 as I got towards the end of the 18, just to see if another 7 years did something even more amazing.  Sadly, it didn’t advance on anything and I’ll even freely admit that the 18 is a superior dram to the 25 year old.  Hell, I’ll even go so far as to say this is easily the best 18 year old whisky I’ve tried to this point.  It’s better balanced than the Highland Park 18, more elegant than the Macallan 18, more subtle than the Talisker 18 and fruitier than the Lagavulin 16.  It’s damn close to being the perfect dram.  Factor in the sub-$90 price tag and you just can’t go wrong.  Find a bottle or a bar with an open bottle (DO NOT MISTAKE THE UNPEATED VERSION FOR THIS ONE) and experience this one for yourself.  It’s a perfect meld of sweet, salt and smoke.  5 perfect stars, my friends.  I can’t recommend this one highly enough.  Cheers."

4.5,"Love this one as a friendly companion on a ever-chilling evening following the first warm day of the year. Just the perfect age for a refined Peated Islay imo, highlighting the peat enough in the foreground without being overpowering nor fading away. 

Sometimes I mix (“blend”) this with the 18 Unpeated cask strength at a 2:1 ratio, to increase the abv and add characteristics of a more dominant malt. Either way, excellent Scotch"
4.5,"My scoring system will give this dram a 91 over 100, but it really feels like less. It is a good dram, but i prefer the 12yo one. 

Bottled at 43%abv with a pale staw color.

On the nose, the peat is lovely, that ""fresh can of tennis balls"" or ""permanent marker"" type of peat. Pepper and champagne. Lovely.

On the palate is nice but kinda boring. There are ashes everywhere, very very soft dram, oranges and cough syrup. 

The finish is the best part. Eternal. With a soft spicy mint note.

Overall i give this dram a 91 over 100, buy a sample and decide for yourself. I would buy the 12yo over this one."

4.25,"The smell is quite caressing, soft, with the pungent and sulphurous peat that initially stays a bit on its own, leaving room for apricot, peach, vanilla, orange peel, a pinch of hazelnut and licorice. Well present a fresh and herbaceous profile. Over time, the peaty component grows without overwhelming, with a pleasant salty touch. Very delicate, age has made the whisky decidedly wise and calm.
On the palate it confirms its gentle spirit, while revealing a rougher aspect of leather and tobacco that is grafted onto the fruity and herbaceous notes, more dome thanks to the smoky and saline peat that becomes more present. Much licorice, a touch of honey, a bitter note of rhubarb, toasted wood. Round and compacted.
Medium finish, burnt wood, licorice, orange, hazelnut.
A higher gradation would have given it more character, and it's a shame because the features to be a really remarkable whisky are all there, and the ripening has however greatly benefited the whisky.
It remains a very pleasant drink, but not exactly unforgettable."
