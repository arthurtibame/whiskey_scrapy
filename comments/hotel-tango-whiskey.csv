2.75,"I was excited to get my hands on this bottle. A bourbon crafted in my own backyard, the bottle emblazoned with a pride flag, and from a distillery owned by a disabled veteran – what isn't to love? It's the America I am proud to be apart of, and it tastes like it, too. A little inclusive, a little unbridled, and free to express itself as it is.

The nose is potent and alcoholic. It smells almost ethanoly – a lot of corn – and late-fall leaf pile, when the leaves are just a little damp. Just a comforting dank earthy smell all around.

The palette is pretty nice. It comes on sweet and a little floraly tastes like honeysuckle and rosewater. Nice and balanced, then hits you with a wallop of spice Definitely the spiciest bourbon I've had. I can tell it's high rye – it smacks you like you ate a spoonful of wasabi or horseradish. I'm a big fan of spicier, high rye bourbon, but if you're not, you probably will not be a fan of this one.

The finish is what you'd expect – just a slow burn of the spice fizzling out. 

I wanted to love this whiskey, but at the end of the day, it's just a little bit simple. It doesn't have any unique or outstanding quality – it's just a solid but basic high rye bourbon. However, for the distillery's first foray into bourbon, I'm very impressed and so excited to see what else they put out!"
