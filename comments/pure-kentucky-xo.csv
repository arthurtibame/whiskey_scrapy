5.0,"Nice complex spice and vanilla flavors and great on a large rock. Very hot at 107 proof yet as you drink it the flavors grow smoother and you can find nut vanilla caramel with enough complexity to fill you palate with rich bourbon tastes. Unfortunately it will be harder to find, since production is limited."

4.0,"Went out last night with a few high school friends at a local bar.  As always, I check the whiskey shelf whenever I go out.  An obscure bottled was tucked in the corner and I asked the bartender as to the whiskey bottle.  It was Pure Kentucky; read the label and had myself a dram.  

The nose is dominated by leather mixed with allspice, vanilla and straw. Arrives hot given the high proof. Let it coat and you can detect the bourbon sweetness of brown sugar with the drying faint oak notes.  The palate is left oaky and dry with a hint spearmint and sweetness of caramel.  Add a teaspoon of water or ice and the sharpness of the alcohol is obviously diminished while the sweeter caramel/brown sugar notes come forward. Recommend with water/ice and is almost a must with the high proof. Somewhat akin to Bookers. A slow sipper and solid bourbon.  If you judge a book by its cover (or whiskey by its label) seems one would think it's a bottom self. This ranks up with the better, stronger, oaky bourbons. [88/100][Tasted: 9/17/16 @ Portly Villager]"

4.0,"Another taste treat enjoyed while smoking some bacon. Loved the oak on the nose and palate along with caramel corn notes. I enjoyed this dram neat, and in spite of its high proof, it was surprisingly smooth without a bite. Empty glass notes? Hard to tell - I was smoking bacon after all."

Super distinctive clove and mulling spices. Put a few drops in and you get something more favorable. Maybe even some sweet black cherry."

3.0,"Aroma: Faint pomegranate, lemon juice, honey, black pepper

Flavor: Honeysuckle, lemon drops

Body/mouthfeel: Fairly light bodied, tongue-tingling, burns from middle of tongue out to cheeks, then sticks to upper back of throat

Overall: Not the smoothest when enjoyed neat, but a surprisingly delicate and pleasant herbal honey profile that lingers long after the burn subsided. Reminiscent of St. Germaine (honey& elderflower liqueur), albeit with quite a kick."

3.0,"This is a good bottle for someone who wants a different taste in bourbon. It has some strong flavors that can be overwhelming if sipped neat, but adding just a bit of water opens up this whiskey. The fact that it is 107 proof allows it to be deluded slightly without being made weak. I wouldn't go out of my way to find a bottle, but if I were in the mood for something different, I wouldn't pass it up."

3.0,"The last of the three bourbon samples given to me by John. Pure Kentucky XO is a NAS straight bourbon that is bottled at 53.5% ABV, is a natural color of dark copper and what I would suspect is non chill filtered. 

The nose starts sweet, like a sherried scotch, but it’s quickly taken over by cinnamon. Sweet cinnamon Red Hots candy. Savory fruits like apricots, pears and green grapes, but all covered in cinnamon and reduced in a bourbon sauce. Brown sugar, vanilla, a little mint and cherry cordials. Water brings out some toffee and caramel, but little else. The cinnamon is the star here and it’s a shining one. 

The palate is heavy on the oak and cinnamon. Mint and light cherries follow, but never really come into the foreground. Fairly peppery. It’s slightly harsh with a bit of a metallic taste. Water tones this down and enhances the cinnamon and oak. I couldn’t really pull much more out of it than that. 

Medium to full bodied, spicy and dry. 
The finish is medium long, very dry with plenty of cinnamon, some cherries and a little of that metallic note. 

Like the Forged Oak, I enjoyed the nose, but the palate really was a letdown. It’s just too harsh and that metallic note really turned me off. It’s a pretty good value at $35 for a higher ABV bourbon, but I would not buy a full bottle. 2.75
Cheers"

3.5,Had to give it a few minutes. First taste was a bit harsh on the palate but nice lingering finish. Tha more I sipped tha more I liked!  Makes a nice gift or unique addition to your bar. If I understand right this bourbon can only be purchased in the state of Kentucky!
3.5,"I admit, I like me some KBD/Willet products so let’s see how this fares:

First of all, serious LOLS for putting a wax seal on a screw top! :) 

On the nose, the first thing that hits you is this smells exactly like Dentyne cinnamon gum. If you really struggle you can pick up a little apple and creme brûlée. On the bright side, none of the proof shows up in the aroma and you can really get in there and huff without singeing the nostrils. 

Palate starts off with caramel and toffee, but quickly switches to a big cinnamon and pepper spice in the midway through with none of the sweeter notes sticking around.

Finish is nice and long with more cinnamon, oak, and a lovely barrel char note. Has some heat to it; this definitely lets you know you are at 107 proof. After everything else has faded there is a hint of eucalyptus. 

The good: no off flavors, long finish, spicy if that’s you’re jam.
The bad: lacks depth and complexity, a little too much cinnamon running roughshod over the other flavors/scents.

At $38, I’m going to have to say it’s not a big win for me. Just too many other options out there for right around $40 that offer more depth including it’s relative Rowan’s Creek and the far superior Old Ezra Barrel Strength."

The finish has sour apple, copper, sawdust."

A little water opens up the smoke a little more, and now brings a certain nuttiness to the table. Not very spectacular, but I think it just needs a little air. Now where did my wife put my decanter...?"

3.25,"Interesting experience. An impulse buy

Nose = toffee, caramel, maybe a fruit note in there 
Palate = very buttery/oily feel at the start, spicy cinnamon & mint flavors to follow. Heat heat!"
3.5,"Oaky, oaky, oaky. Dark brown sugars. Rich and big. A cheaper version of Noah’s Mill but just as good?!"
1.5,Honestly not a fan. Since this has moved to a NAS bottle you can tell it’s a young Batch. Heavy ethanol taste with some cinnamon and tobacco notes. Strong flavor but not a welcoming flavor. Bitter. I’ve also heard consistency has been an issue with this line so maybe just not a good batch.

4.0,"BACKGROUND: Pure Kentucky is a sourced bourbon bottled by Kentucky Bourbon Distillers, LTD, the same company responsible for Willett Family Estate Bourbon and Rye Whiskeys, Willett Pot Still Reserve Bourbon, Noah’s Mill Bourbon, Rowan’s Creek Bourbon and others.

Prior to 2012, the label carried a 12 year age statement, but it was later removed from the bottle.  Most sources indicate, however, that the bourbon continues to be aged for roughly the same amount of time today.

At 107 proof and costing just $38 a bottle, it is an affordably priced higher-octane bourbon.

NOSE:  I find the nose to be wonderfully delightful with smells of leather, oak, tobacco and the dusty and woody air inside a distillery rickhouse.  It also smells a bit like the pages inside a leather-bound antique book that has not been opened for several years.  If a bourbon nose can be termed as masculine, this one would fit the bill.

PALATE: The leather and other notes from the nose remain present on the palate, but mint is the most dominant initial flavor.  The bourbon is not overly sweet at first sip, but toffee-like sweetness because readily apparent before the glencairn is empty.  Strangely, the first sip resulted in a prolonged tingling sensation on my lips and tongue, which might be attributable to the proof, but I often drink high-proof bourbons and never before experienced anything similar.

FINISH: The finish is a long one, and a Kentucky hug revisits with each sip.  Barrel char and oak stop by for a visit during the finish, as well.  Though you can tell this Pure Kentucky spent more than a decade in the barrel, the finish is not drying like many well-aged bourbons.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: This is a great full-bodied bourbon that makes me feel I should drink it while wearing a smoking jacket, holding a meerschaum pipe, and reading a book with a monocle.  

I am not a fan of many of the Willet products that KBD also bottles, but I’m quite happy with this purchase.  It is a bottle that I will be pulling off of the shelf often."
4.0,"Toffee, brown sugar and caramel flavors. Slight orange finish, incredibly balanced that’s great neat or over ice."
3.75,"Starts similarly to the Baker’s 107 proof bourbon with heavy pepper on the palate. It doesn’t last long, as a floral (or something botanical) comes to the forefront almost as strong. The finish is short but intense with burn."
4.0,"Neat.  The nose is spicy cinnamon, oak, tobacco, toffee, some expected heat.  No surprises in the taste, lots of spicy, red hot cinnamon candy, charred oak, rye spices.  Long, drying finish with tart ,sweet, oak, cinnamon.

Dry, cinnamon, oak, rye are the notes that pop out for me. A must try for those who don't care for the butterscotch/caramel sweetness of many bourbons.  Good price for a  100+ proofer. Willett fans will enjoy and must have"

2.75,"First Willet product ive had. Seen some positive review on the higher proof bourbons so hopeful, $27 could be a bargain. Poured neat, good thick legs. Nose is unique with big red gum with fruity overtones, dusty wood and vanilla frosting. The 107 has a tinge of ethanol. Palate is a rush of atomic fireball, red hots and clove with some rye spice and oak rounding out. The most cinnamon heavy bourbon ive ever had. Finishes long with raw hot smoky cinnamon, rye spice and malty oak fading slowly dry. This is unlike any bourbon Ive had, in fact doesn't even taste like traditional bourbon to me. The 107pf brings a lot of flavor and it lasts but will probably be polarizing for most. Has some qualities I really like but overall not exactly what I want out of a bourbon. I swayed back and forth with a B grade for this but will settle on C+.... 78/100 as I doubt I would repurchase....... Those who enjoy Fireball or other cinnamon whiskies should look this one up"
