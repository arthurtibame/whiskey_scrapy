5.0,"The nose is an incredible blend of spicy oak and floral notes, candy apple, sweet caramel, baking spices and dark chocolate holding everything together. The palate is dry and very oaky with dark chocolate bringing a wave of baking spices, brown sugar, vanilla and caramel that swirl around the mouth. The finish is long and dry with oak and dark chocolate, with vanilla, brown sugar and caramel fading pleasantly, leaving the mouth swirling in flavor."
