3.0,"One might imagine when Hollywood celebrities get together and reminisce about their Oscars and how much they love themselves, they would be drinking a fine whiskey from a crystal decanter. The Hilhaven Lodge would like you to believe they might be drinking this whiskey, which is a blend of rye whiskey from the 80's, Tennessee whiskey from the 90's, and bourbon from the 2000's. Blending whiskies is nothing new, but blending from different decades is unique and rare. This is a fairly dark whiskey for being 80 proof, and it's also much more flavorful than most 40% alcohol whiskies.  Fruity and crisp, I like this juice! Easy drinker for sure, but I wish it had a tad more depth. Raising the ABV to a 90-110 proofer would make this some seriously good stuff.  As is, not too shabby so if it's available in your area, buy a bottle or try it at the bar. 3.9 out of 5 boners"
