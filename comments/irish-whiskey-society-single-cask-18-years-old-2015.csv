4.0,"A weekend of 4 Irish whiskey samples.

4/4 Irish Whisky Society single cask 2015 (cask no. 21885 - 1997-2015 - bottle 75/114)

Nose: coconut - really! - a bid like roasted and caramelized coconut flakes, then plums and vanilla, sweet white grapes, a bid of banana. Very fruity and sweet on the nose with the cask strength ABV being not noticeable as such.

Palate: very sweet directly up front, then dried fruits (mostly exotic) and a very creamy smoothness nicely distributed by that still very fitting alcohol percentage, surprisingly no bitterness at all even though it is 18 years old and has that quite high ABV. Impressive.

Finish: long and sweet with only a slight gingery burn on the tongue that feels just right."
