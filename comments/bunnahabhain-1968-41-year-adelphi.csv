4.0,"The third of 10 whiskies I tasted at an Adelphi event was, I think, the oldest single malt to yet pass my lips. This marriage of two casks (first fill sherry, we were told) was at risk of falling below the legal whisky ABV after 41 years of maturation. It’s deep rosewood in color. The nose is a delicate honey, old books and dried porcini mushrooms. In the mouth, there’s cola, coffee beans and cocoa powder. The finish is long — delicately sweet to start with and then turning dry. Though beautifully balanced and with no negative impact from its decades of interaction with the cask, the low ABV leaves it feeling a little watery. Still, a marvelous old master that I would happily drink any day of the week. Last seen at auction in January, where the winning bid was 750 pounds. You could do a lot worse for the money."
