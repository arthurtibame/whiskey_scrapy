4.75,Funky oak and super complex. Nose is a top 5 in my book and I've been around the  block.
5.0,"One of the best I’ve had! This bourbon is so unique and the age shines through! Proof is perfect.  Too many people think bourbons need to be barrel proof.  

Nose - Cherry Pie, Apples, caramel, sweet oak, barrel char, tobacco 

Palate - First thing that hits you is a dominate unique note that was hard for me to pinpoint.  Finally pinpointed it as delicate smoke and clove that nearly make it taste finished.  Big cherry pie note also! Hints of leather and tobacco. So beautiful! In addition you get red apples, caramel, sweet oak, and the most amazing creamy mouth feel with a finish that goes for days! 

Everything you want in a bourbon but unique enough to stand out! Wild Turkey flexed with this one!"
4.75,"Rich vanilla, baking spice, barrel spice, and barrel funk on the nose.

This is a deep, robust, full bodied whiskey.  It has a strong interplay between earthy and sweet.  I get a lot of rye spice, damp earth - almost mushrooms, barrel, vanilla, tobacco, smoke, as well as oak spice, cream, and baked apple.

The finish is very long and is dominated by apple, oak spice, wood, leather, and tobacco.  I think that I might also be picking up some roasted marshmallow.

It has a lot of sharp flavors that have been mellowed and married together, to create a whiskey with lots of strong distinct flavors that are ultimately very balanced, but still easy to pull apart.

The sweet flavors are very well balanced and contrasted to the barrel and earthy elements."
4.75,"Excellent bourbon, typical WT profile and the oak is a sweet oak with a great finish for 100 proof.  Only fault I have is for a $175 bottle wish they would make this a higher proof non chill filtered for the price point, similar to the BTACs, would love to taste this straight from barrel.   Still very good but have had some SB Russel’s reserve store picks lately for $59 that stack up to this.  Update 6/11/20- the nose is a 5 * for sure, could smell this S*** all night.  Still sticking with original rating, do start to get that Smokey note to, good though."

3.5,"So as with all other reviews so far...I haven't spent enough time for a proper review but lets go.

I've had this now 3 times (not just 3 pours). I've compared it side by side with decades and a 10 year pick of spirit. I've also put it next to Knob creek 15 year which I'll be getting to sooner than later. So I think I have at least the general notes on this one. 

Nose - Instantly the funky turkey notes come out, I don't like the words dusty as that implies a decades old bottling and this is nothing like that. I'm fairly certain that this is camp nelson which is kinda the turkey boy lover's rickhouse and likely one that will upset non turkey lovers. I'm a bit agnostic with wild turkey...I like them but I don't think their ""off"" notes are some kind of magical dream land. With that funk however is an amazingly sweet nose. Each swirl gives me something new, from vanilla, creme brulee, shoe polish, wood finish, deep old oak (good sweet oak) and deep old funky oak. There's a lot to unwind and it never seems to come at you the same way twice in a row. Water teases out more spice which is a surprisingly big part of this bottle. 

Taste - So the first pour today and what strikes me is not any one flavor, but how many layers there are here. Up front just non descriptive sweetness, almost a corn sugar like note. Then there's a level of richness and more vanilla and light hints of oak. Then you think you're going into a finish, but you're not there yet. You get darker sweets, perhaps some chocolate, some oak, and a sharp and shocking spicy note. FINALLY, we're onto a finish where you get oak funky oak and well aged vanillas. Water mutes a lot of the transitions and brings the whisky together more. Here there's a bit more bitterness and sourness to the oak and the spice comes in earlier and then fades. Water does this whisky ZERO favors. 

Overall I think wild turkey has done a really nice job with this bottling. They've managed to bring us a high oak and high sweet expression of wild turkey and not dumbed it down for the masses like a Buffalo Trace offering would have done. I think this will please huge turkey fans, but I don't see this being a wow bottle to those who aren't in the turkey camp already. This is a niche bottling that show cases a profile I don't believe the average bourbon drinker, experienced or not will want to pay huge premiums for. 

And with that I'm left with a challenging score to give. 175 MSRP but a great many stores are asking over 200 (which is sadly what I paid).  Price not considered in the scoring here, but it's worth noting it. If you really are a hardcore Turkey fan this might be a 90 or about a 4.0 but for the rest of the world that's about an 85 or a 3.25. Lets call it a day at a 3.5. 

Review done after about 5-6 pours of this over the course of 4 days. There's been no noticeable change with the bottle being open but this is one that may take upwards of 6 months to change."

5.0,"Taste: 2 oz. neat in glen cairn, then 1 oz with 2 drops of water in a flight with three other WTMK expressions.

Nose:  The first thing that strikes me is that signature Wild Turkey dusty, funky nose.  It isn't soggy or woody but more like an old leather library book.  Think the nose on Rare Breed but older, dustier, and amped up, and with less ethanol.  Moving past that I got delicious vanilla with apple blossoms.  I wouldnt say the taste was exactly all floral, but more like that smell you would get when walking through an orchard- part flowers, part apple skins.  Lastly, plenty of oak.  The nose seems to bloom and roll out of the glass and fills the room.

Palate:  The dusty WT funk note is unabashedly front and center.  Vanilla transforms to a spicier cherry note, almost like cherry cough lozenger followed by oak and then fading to ripe red apple. All the while there is barrel char hiding in the background that is just enough not to overwhelm, but let you know that this has been in the barrel for a good long while. The complexity on the palate is a captivating roller coaster ride that features all the best of the things that Wild Turkey is known for, and perhaps the best is yet to come on the finish.  CAUTION- Some may get overwhelmed with the dusty WT signature note.  Fans like me will say they have been waiting all of their Turkey lives to get to that level in a bottle, while others may lament that there was something in there that was ""just a bit off.""  This expression is aimed at Wild Turkey's fan base, and not a bottle to get you started into their product line.

Finish:  At 100 proof this outkicks the coverage and finishes like a barrel proof.  Not in an ethanol way, but in the rich, warming, and lasting finish.  My guess is that at bottling this did not have to be downproofed to get to 100 proof much.  The richness is so there, and any bitterness that may have been imparted by adding water is completely missing-  a great thing!  You get vanilla, cherry, a bit of clove, and nutmeg that will keep you coming back for more!

Overall-  The bottle lives up to the hype.  That said, $175 is a lot of money to pay for the experience.  I say this every year when the WTMK series is released, and I think alot of the excess cost is in the fancy magnetic box.  What  really made me happy on this one is that WT did not stray at all from what makes it a favorite.  Instead it took its very best, and then the careful aging made something super that much better!  I was afraid that this might be over oaked and taste like soggy wood, but it was not.  Just the right amount for an elder statesman without going overboard.  The next night I set up a tasting board of 17yr BiB, 17 Yr, Decades, and Revival.  I kept Cornerstone out of it to be fair, and here is how I picked them-
1. 17 BiB
2.  Revival (could have been a toss up with Decades but the rich, sweet, jamminess of the Sherry finish had me at hello)
3.  Decades
4.  17yr- a distant 4th

It will be very difficult to knock this out of the running for bourbon of the year."

4.75,"Color is burnished copper, maybe not quite as dark as I'd expect for the age (but then again it's 'only' 100 proof).

Nose - Dark and earthy with leather, oak, vanilla, tobacco, clove, cinnamon;  some caramel lurking underneath, but it's not a particularly sweet nose.  Definitely has that WT funk note. After breathing for a bit, I get some dark cherry and red apple.

Palate -  medium mouthfeel, slightly oily. Starts with burnt caramel, vanilla, black tea, leather, and oak; also some clove, a bit of cinnamon. There's a smoky note in there as well. Not really getting much fruit on the palate, maybe some baked/spiced apples.  Medium finish is fairly dry, with notes of oak, cocoa powder, and pepper lingering.

I've enjoyed all of the Master's Keep releases, and this one is no exception. It's been a while since I've had Decades, but I remember it being a bit richer/sweeter while this one is drier and more complex. There's a dried leather note in this BiB that reminds me of RR2002.

I'm deducting a quarter point based on the price (which I feel is reasonable in the current market but certainly not a 'value'), and for the fact that I think that the proof is holding it back from it's true potential."
5.0,Top 5 bourbons ever. Has a unique funk and smokiness. Really flavorful for such a low proof.
