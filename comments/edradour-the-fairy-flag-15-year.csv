5.0,"I absolutely loved this. As other commenters notes, definitely raisins and dark dried fruits. I actually found that neat it wasn’t too hot at all and was blown away by the thickness and creaminess of it. Leaving it to breathe for a while just smoothed our some of the spices. Finish was long and warm. Delicious!"
3.0,"Dried fruit, toasted cereal and light smoke on the nose. Medium bodied, with apples, honey, and fresh oak spices on the palate. The finish is fruity and of medium length, with a pleasant cinnamon aftertaste. Overall a respectable dram, but a bit uninspiring and overpriced for what it delivers ($156 CAD). Worth trying, but not worth buying for me."
2.0,"While others experienced raisins, I found the fruity elements to resemble nail polish - really not my thing. There's also hints of toasted barley, like oatmeal, with a body that is light and fragile.

This is not, IMHO, a very good dram."
4.0,"My grandmother (Mema) grew up on a Texas farm during the Depression, and her family is predominantly Scottish, so let's just say frugality is one of her dominant traits. When we'd go to the movies, she would always have me sneak in candy because she would sooner die than pay $4 for a box of Raisinets. Why do I tell that story? Because this dram IS Raisinets candy in liquid form. Raisin and chocolate swirl together on the nose and fill out the rich, spicy palate. A little bit of vanilla and sweet coconut hint at some American oak influence beyond the obvious sherry qualities. The finish is reasonably long and pleasant and, just when you think it's all over, the spices come back for an encore - cinnamon, clove, cardamom. A very tasty drop of whisky!"

3.0,Runs hot for 46%. Raisiny wood heavy fruitcake taste. Definitely not really my cup of tea due to the fact the oak and alcohol influence really aren't in balance with the rest of the whisky. Few drops of water made no difference. Solid 3
