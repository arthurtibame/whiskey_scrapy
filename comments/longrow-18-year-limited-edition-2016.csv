4.5,"Such a great expression of light peat, smoke and all the sweet and floral notes of a lighter expression. Vanilla and citrus backed by smoky sweetness that lingers long after. Would love a bit more oil on the palette fro mouthfeel. But nose and follow through excel and all together this is an excellent dram worth seeking out."
4.75,"Phenomenal scotch! Wow. Peat, orange zest, and oak right on the nose. The taste is of chocolate, vanilla, spices, and that classic bit of firewood.

The perfect marriage of Islay and highland scotches. If you run from Islays, it may not be your bag, but this is unbelievably smooth and makes me a HUGE fan of Cambelltown scotch. 

Ordering a bottle now..."
3.75,slight licorice. smoke and peat around the edges. full bodied and decent after taste.
4.5,Very easy drinking. You really get that sherry cask coming through.
5.0,"I smell ashtray with some sweetness. Definitely smoky, I can’t describe it but it’s a very well balanced dram. It’s got a nice sweet peat finish. Very nice and smooth. I love it and If I could find it I’d buy."
