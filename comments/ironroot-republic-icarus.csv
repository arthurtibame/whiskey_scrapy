4.5,"Love the way they incorporate the peat into this guy. It’s just right. Not overwhelming, but you still know it’s there. None of the off-putting smoke flavors that typically turn me off to peat. Sweet port flavors round it out. Creamy and sweet with a savory smokiness."
5.0,"This is the perfect blend of smoky brine and tawny port and corn whiskey. Rich, deep and complex. Got a sample out of the barrel at the distillery and it was incredible. I know it’ll be proofed down a little bit when I buy a bottle in May, but I’m really looking forward to it."

Nose: its a merri-go-round for your senses. Top notes of sweet red fruit (raspberries) and sugar. Gives way to classic bourbon notes of vanilla and brown sugar with a faint whiff of smoke and peat. Eventually the character of the Ironroot corn mash comes charging through. Deep rich red fruits and sweet corn, candied bacon, ceylon tea...and then it all circles back around. 
Palate: beautiful, sweet, rounded, and wonderfully balanced. The port influence is up front with raisins and mixed nuts. That gorgeous rich corn and oak follows up. There is a very faint undercurrent of smoke and a touch of brininess as it closes out. 
Finish: tart fruit, drying leather, sugary port sweetness sprinkled with salt. 

As it spends time in the glass, more of the Islay begins to come through but never in any dominant way. Its gorgeously nuanced and provides a balance to the sweetness of the corn and port. This is the definition of integration and balance in a whiskey."
