3.0,"Sourced (just if you're curious) from Alberta Distillers (makers of Alberta Premium and a host of 100% straight ryes being sourced and bottled by the likes of Whistlepig, etc.,.), which is handy since both CC and Alberta Distillers are owned by Beam-Suntory. And yet, surprisingly, the taste profile is not all that close to what I'm used to from Alberta Distillers. But, so: standard (artificial) colour; big, pungent bubblegum/clove on the nose, mint, dill and pickles, caraway, rye. Cinnamon, a bit of tobacco. Big licorice (which seems to--rather unpleasantly--take over the proceedings if you leave the bottle open for more than a week or two). Just a tiny bit of the maple/butterscotch sweetness you expect from Canadian whisky. Burnt caramel, dark rum? Taste strikes an interesting balance between what I expect from a straight rye and a Canadian whisky--peppery, spicy heat, bubblegum, dill, ginger, bread, brining spices, honeycomb, butterscotch, maple. A hint of sourness and the growing licorice. It would benefit from a bit more age and, say, a 5% or so ABV bump. And don't let it sit for too long or the whole thing gets overtaken by a rather aggressive, not-so-nice perfume-y, artificial licorice sweetness. But particularly for the price (sub-$30 in Canada), this is actually a pretty serviceable sipper and an even better cocktail whisky (though cut the sugar in your old-fashioned recipe). Definitely one of the ""new breed"" of Canadian whiskies that actually takes the word ""rye"" seriously, and that's worth something."

3.0,"A little spice, sweet with citrus. Easy to drink. Good quality introduction rye for those beginning to learn. Good value for the price point."
2.0,Sweet fruity young rye and fresh cut raw oak with gentle rye spice. Like Stalk & Barrel Red it tastes a little young. Like a more refined Dillion's Rye or a subtle Crown Northern Harvest Rye. $28 in Ontario.

3.0,"Great for those breaking into the whiskey scene. Sweet, smooth, and easy to sip. 
Perhaps too simple for connoisseurs. For the price, it's hard to fault it."

3.0,"I forgot I had a bottle of this stucked away in storage. For the price pretty OK, sweet rye flavors, not very spicy though. Missing a bit of the usual punch because of the low ABV. Perfect to see if you like ryes."

3.0,This is one of my favourite rye’s. Surprising that the price is so low considering the taste and quality. I usually drink it neat and am never disappointed. It is the “Green Label” of Canadian Club for sure.

3.0,"Caramel on the nose, along with floral notes, an unmistakably clean rye aroma, sweet spiciness on the palate, and a smooth lingering finish with moderate heat. Excellent value for $28.65 in Ontario."

1.0,"Might be fine for cocktails, but I wouldn't recommend it for sipping. For the price, I can't complain too much. It's definitely a step up from the standard Canadian Club."

3.0,"Mixed hype leading up to this. It is very affordable, but so many people have said it is amazing. On the nose I get a few floral notes, a little spice and with time some butterscotch, not to strong. On the palate sweetness of vanilla and some spice. The finish is descent length, with some oak notes maybe even char. After having a few the finish is almost bitter for me, but not quite. For the price this is really good (3.5 stars)"

4.0,"Canadian Club Green delivers a great whisky for a very reasonable price.  Nose has hints of spice, cinnamon, fruit, rye, sweetness.  Dry, spicy finish.  This was tested blind against Basil Hayden and JP Wiser 2018 and was the clear winner.  Usually drink CC Green with ice and I didn’t recognize it.  This is a go to for an everyday easy drinking whisky.  Extra points for the price point."

2.0,"Pretty boring, bog standard rye. Better than the usual swill Canadian Club produces. Sips OK but really shines in cocktails. Spice is nice but leaves you wanting more complexity. Value per $ is top notch. But it is hard to grab this when you can have Lot 40 or Northern Harvest for just a twoonie or two more."

5.0,"I am drinking one right now, tbh i don't know how people can say this has spice, apple, caramel or vanilla in it or any other taste, for me it smells rye (like beer) and alcohol and it taste rye (beer taste also) and alcohol. I tried so hard to try to guess ingredients other than rye and ethanol but couldn't, it's really poor in flavors felt like i was drinking a Pabst beer with just more burn and strength and am really not fan of beers but it doesn't make this product bad at all. Everything 40% ABV or more and for the cheapest price, i fucking take it! Right now am so drunk i have difficulty breathing. I drink it with some ice cubes and sometimes without and occasionally mix it with soda or anything else. Cheap price, Got me drunk, 40% ABV easily swallowable and smooth, Enjoying Country music, That's a 5 stars."

3.75,"Although the first glass or two is pretty harsh, it opens up to become a very solid classic rye. No shortage of spice here, and I doubt you could find anything better at this price point (at least here in BC)."
