4.25,"Pretty peaty and Campbeltown-y for a Highland Park. Pretty dark and complex but I think this could have been really amazing with a bit more aging. Still, 93 points."
4.0,Solid. Much preferred to the earlier Valkyrie.

4.0,"Strong robust flavor with a lot of the signature Highland Park flavor.  Really good, it's probably stronger/bolder than Highland Park 12, but less nuanced.  Really good, but I think that the 12 is great, and quite a bit cheaper."

2.5,Peat and iodine. Heavy on the palate still with some sweetness. Not particularly in balance.

4.0,Fruity on the front end. Hints of vanilla.

4.0,Balancing act of nutty sherry notes and charcoal smoke. I always wanted a deeper peated Highland Park. This does it.
4.0,"A bit of smoke and peat on the nose.  Moderate smoke burn, salt with a dry pepper finish mingled with smoke.  More of the standard Highland Park signature flavor comes through than in Valkyrie, but it still isn't as robust as in the 12 year.    Good, enjoyable entry, but I still prefer 12 over this.  I prefer this over Valkyrie, but still a fine whiskey in its own right."
4.0,"info: Le Valknut est la deuxième édition de la série créée en partenariat avec Jim Lyngvild. Une partie de l'orge utilisé dans ce single malt a été cultivé dans les Orcades et vieilli en fut de chêne américain de sherry. N'étant pas un fan de Highland Park à la basse, une des raisons pour laquelle je tenais à gouter à cette édition était les bons commentaires relativement à la fumé plus accentué de cette édition.

Nez: lingerie, thym frais, des herbes et du sel. Le sel fumé typique de Highland Park. Pelure d'orange.

Bouche: Céréalier, graine de tournesol, agrumes, sel et fumé. 

Final: medium sur le zeste d'orange et la touche de fumé.

Overall: Pas mauvais, je ne peux pas dire que je suis tombé à terre mais ça se prend bien. Une complexité intermédiaire. Ce n'est pas assez pour me convertir à Highland Park mais, définitivement plus près de ma palette de goût. Surprenant comme texture; assez grasse en fait. Laissez le temps à votre verre de bien s'oxyder, cela révèlera les notes de d'herbe et de lingerie. Pour ceux qui aime le style de Highland Park, c'est une expression que vous devriez vous procurer. Pour ceux qui, comme moi, n'est généralement pas fan de Highland Park, ça vaut la peine de s'y attarder aussi puisqu'il s'agit d'un nouvel axe qui ne recoupe pas l'habituel cercle d'arôme que l'on retrouve dans leurs innombrable éditions. On me disait que c'était dans la ligné du Dark Origin. Je ne trouve pas. Hormis la fumé de Highland Park, je ne vois pas ce qui recoupe ces deux éditions. Le Dark Origin était Sherry-fumé alors que celui-ci est plus sur les herbes, les céréales et la fumé. Pour le jeu de sherry et de fumé inhabituel, je recommanderais le Dark Origin au lieu du Valknut (selon mes goûts à moi). Bref, selon mon échelle à moi (60-69; passable, 70-79; bien, 80-89; très bien, 90-99; excellent), je considère que c'est un ""très bien"" mais plus près du ""bien"" que du ""excellent"": 82%."

3.75,"I started out neat. Surprisingly strong, peaty up front. On the palate, a spicy, citrusy blend. Cutting with ice subtled the strength and unlocked the earth tones. Solid drink"

3.5,"淡淡煙燻味 加上 果香

尾韻中長。帶點煙燻風味"
4.0,"One of the few scotches made quite exceptional with a large ice ball, Valknut delivers a fudgey briney experience to the NAS offerings of this Orkney distillery.

Nose: A little hay backed with malt, biscuits, orange-blossom honey, and what will be revealed to be dark chocolate.
Palate: Fudge, Spearmint, a little hay, and a lasting brininess to balance out the otherwise decadent palate
Finish: relatively short, but not unappealing. The fudge and touch of hay linger. 

Adding Ice removes the hay, softens the salt, and brings out fudge and a touch of Red Apple."
4.75,"When you want a Scotch to cut through a winter chill, this is your remedy. Lots of peat and flavour to assist in defeating winter."
3.5,"The Valknut is the second installment of what I'll call the Highland Park 'Valk Series.' It follows the Valkyrie (which I've yet to try). The third is the Valkfather, which I don't think has been released.

There has been a recent proliferation of HP NAS releases. This one is of the more affordable and abundant of the lot. The Valk series feels like it's one level below the core range, if that makes any sense. They're not quite part of the core range, but aren't one-off, random releases either. Let's get into it.

***I came back to this one about a month or two later. A handful of reviews I did around this time came out strange and I'm thinking I burnt out my palate. I came back, and it's much better.***

Nose: Hardly any peat smoke is detectable. Instead its more of a sulfuric note. There is also some sweetness. Bubblegum, green apple, honey, toffee, and vanilla. There is also some cinnamon, black pepper, and clove spice. Walnut and sun-dried tomato round this one off, giving it a unique profile.

Palate: Butterscotch, honey, vanilla, caramel, and toffee. Red berry (strawberry, cranberry). More of that sulfur note, but otherwise very little peat influence. Virtually no smoke. Some milk chocolate on the back end. Nutty and oaky.

Finish: Moderate-long. Hot with cinnamon, black pepper, baking spice. Oak heavy. More of the sulfur and some delicious dark chocolate.

This is a tricky one to rate. When I first cracked this a few months back, I thought that was a pretty good dram. Fast forward to last night, and I found it be atrocious. I had to postpone my review until tonight because it was so wildly different than I had remember it. I even compared to HP 15, which I'm quite fond of, and it held up.

The nose, which was initially my favorite part of the dram, seems completely disjointed. That and the palate are overrun by the sulfur notes. I love those notes in Laphroaigs, but this one is too thin to in other areas to compensate for such a strong and potentially off-putting note. The finish was too harsh for 46.8%.

I really wanted to like this one. And, strangely enough, I did when I first cracked it. But unlike with most bottles, I found that this one got significantly worse with time. I've had the HP 12 and 15, and now this Valknut. The score is: Age-Statement releases 2-NAS 0. I love the homage to Nordic culture as much as the next guy, but dammit Highland Park, focus less on the bottle design and more on what you're putting into it.

***Came back to this and I'm convinced that my previous assessment was a symptom of a burnt palate. The notes are much the same, but the nose is now pleasant, the palate robust, and the finish much more satisfying. 

Confidently bumped up from a 2.75 to a 3.5. I'm happy to see that as I'm finishing the bottle, my initial liking to this bottle was warranted."

3.75,"향 : 스모키, 깔끔한 훈연, 그 속 헤더향, 담뱃재, 
맛 : 달콤, 달달 스모키, 쌉쌀, 치고 올라오는 오키함, 
피니쉬 : 드라이, 짧은 맛과 여운이 있는 스모키 향, 

다음날 아침에도 생각나는 맛과 향
안주 알밤과 매칭 굳

은근히 긴 피니쉬로 생각보다 괜찮음 피티보다 스모키가 더 강조되어 나름 색깔이 확실한 것 같음"

0.75,This was the worst of the Highland Park Whiskies I had so far. It had the HP character but it misses everything else. It has nothing else really except for more ABV a bid more peat and much more bitterness which is really unpleasant.

4.5,"It's beautiful and complex. Just a hint of smoke on the nose, with some apricots and a touch of brine following. The taste is spicy, not peppery, but more like clove and cinnamon. It's oily, and really coats the palate. The finish brings back the smoke, with more apricot and almonds. Good stuff."
4.0,Delightful. Slightly Smokey & very Caramel-y.

3.5,"Color: Orange gold

Nose: Green apple, oak, pepper, spicy, smoky, and semi-floral.

Palate: Green apple, oak, pepper, spicy, citrus, oily, and smoky.

Finish: Long, spicy, charred wood, vanilla, oak, and smoky."
3.5,"Light fudgey, briney and butterscotch flavors come through on the palate. I quite like it. However there is quite an astringent almost burning aftertaste which detracts. Interesting dram but like most affordable HP NAS's not one to write home about."
3.75,"This is a curious whiskey, lots of interesting scents and flavors, but all a little disjointed. 
Initially strong diesel and peat on the nose, after a few minutes these ebb while sherry, barley, vanilla, powdered chocolate and stewed prunes appear. Rich, oily and a little young and hot on the palate with cereal grains, honey, vanilla, walnuts and a hint of sherry and diesel. The long finish has spicy, sweet and savory notes."

4.5,"More flavorful than the 12, but I probably prefer the 12 over this. It's definitely one of my favorites though."
