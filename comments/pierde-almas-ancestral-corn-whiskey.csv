4.0,"This is a wild ride. It tastes like the cornfields in the dog days of summer of my youth. It tastes like the sunset after a day of field hockey and soccer. It's unmistakably Mexican in origin, but anyone from the southern US will have a memory of the smell. The tight slate and sweet corn comes right on through.

Nose: Graphite, Corn on the cob
Palate: Slate, butter, sweet corn
Finish: medium and dry.

A truly unique experience from a truly phenomenal mezcal producer."
