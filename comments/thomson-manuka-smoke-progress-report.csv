0.25,A foul concoction that combines a heavy handed dose of honey with acrid smoke. The final result resembles turpentine. Avoid at all costs!
4.5,Good! Subtle smokiness...
2.0,"I'm not sure why you would bottle and then sell an unfinished product. Especially when it is so far away from coming together. I get that it may well one day become a decent whiskey... but right now it's not much fun to drink and that's really the only sensible way to score it. Smoky like a campfire (ie annoying and hurts your eyes)... no peat, just wood that is a long way from becoming integrated. I can't help think that this is sold purely as a tourist novelty... maybe I'll have a slumber party and make manuka honey hot toddys to finish off the bottle."

3.5,"Managed to make it to this distillery last weekend as part of a stag do and tried a tasting flight including this one. Definitely a different experience. Wouldn't drink to much of it but an extra .25 for uniqueness. Users NZ barley smoked over native Manuka wood. Younger but not harsh,  manuka smoke dominates. 3.5"
