4.25,"Nose: The initial nosing showed mild, sweet peat reek together with a host of estery fruit aromas (apple, pear, lemon, orange). A little grappa and even a hint of slivovitz start to emerge as it rests in the glass, followed by grassy hay and a whiff of struck match. Adding water blooms the nose with floral fragrances emerging. Violet and honeysuckle are apparent, and a sharp-but-heady aroma of gentian and chamomile tea.

Palate: Sweet and chili hot on the arrival. Quite commanding as the initial heat builds even further with hot cinnamon, white pepper, ginger and spicy herbs flashing into the development. The heat spreads throughout the mouth and expands, evolving sour lemon, tart pineapple and ginger syrup before starting to subside as sweetness reasserts. Ashy peat smoke mounts towards the finish along with juicy fruit notes. The texture is creamy and full, but very clean. Adding water lowers the heat to a glowing and pleasant burn but in no way spoils the texture. It also seems to unfurl the smoke, lending it depth and richness, and the constant sweetness becomes quite honeyed, but not cloying.

Finish: Medium/long. The heat from the arrival finally dissipates and gives way to smoky lemon, herbal and vegetal notes (there's even a mezcal hint). The aftertaste has a faint coffee bean and chocolate presence. Adding water develops a little weak-tea tannin in the aftertaste and reveals a slightly salty edge.

The nose is more complex than might at first appear. It is light, clean and fresh in profile but also densely packed and tightly integrated. It only shows its full personality over time but the full-bodied tar and maritime assertiveness of some other Ardbeg expressions never comes through. This is more reserved, fragrant and gentle - there is a sweetness and elegance throughout but over time it gains a very rich quality.

The palate does not change quite so much over time. The nigh-on explosive heat of the arrival persists with every taste, most likely due to it being carried on a reasonable amount of alcohol. Dilution considerably tames the arrival, bearing this out, and also rounds and enlarges the palate in general. I'd recommend a neat taste to start with, but don't be hesitant to add a good dash of water - it works very well and does not develop sour plastic-like peat flavours.

A beautiful and constantly evolving nose but I felt the palate and finish, whilst very good indeed, were not quite up to the same level (however we're only talking a drop from 5 to 4 stars for the palate). It's a very, very good whisky but not quite at ""excellent"" level.

Tasted from a 30ml sample. (The source where I bought the sample still has bottles available, but at AUS$450 I don't think I'll be buying one).

""Very Good"" : 4.25 stars"
4.25,"Bloody hell I have no idea why this is so lowly rated.. straight out of gate it was beautiful without any water. Sweet peated vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon. By the end there was the edges of lemony peat coming out which I'm not a huge fan of but still impressive dram. A must try for any Ardbeg fan."

1.0,I did not enjoy the peat and it is definitely an acquired taste. Definitely will not try again.
