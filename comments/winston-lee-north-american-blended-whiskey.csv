3.5,"A light straw yellow color illuminates this whiskey, while super thin viscous legs dribble down the glass.

The nose is a light bodied, fresh nose with notes of dry farm straw, grass, garden herbs, vanilla, leather, lemon, dried apricot, and orchard fruits particularly pear.

The palate has an oily mouthfeel and a richer yet simpler taste than the nose would let on. There are notes of vanilla, caramel, maple, and dry grass.

The finish is mild and it slowly tapers off and fades like an 80’s rock song.

This blend of North American whiskeys from Lee Spirits isn’t bad. I’d say it isn’t their best product as Lee’s specialty is gin, but it’s still a decent blend. If I remember right it’s a blend of bourbon, Canadian, and a white dog rye. I’d recommend trying it and visiting Lee Spirits’ speakeasy, Brooklyn’s on Boulder in Colorado Springs. Thanks friends! Cheers!"
