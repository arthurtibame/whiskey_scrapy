2.0,"Not too bad, but really nothing too interesting either.  Just not really worth its cost.  Can get much better for much less.  In a way---just too many conflicting flavors happening at the same time, with really no one single stand out flavor"
4.25,smokey. well balanced.  not too much burn.  sweet up front

4.0,"I sampled an ounce at a local bar and thought that it outplayed the Prophecy - in the opinion of my taste buds, of course. I'd consider purchasing a bottle so that I could sit down and spend some more time investigating its flavour profile. I found it to be surprisingly layered (especially after reading reviews)... Light peat smoke and sweetness came off as a candied bacon, and I would receive some subtle toffee / espresso notes as it developed and on the finish. [2016-12-13] [$10 at The Marquis]"

2.0,"Slightly peated but overall the experience feels peated - broad spectrum of peat, salt and smoke."
3.5,"Rich gold color, perhaps a little red tint.  Nice fingers on the glass but it doesn’t have a thick or oily mouth feel.  Nose reminds me of lemon and olive.  Initially sharp with a little burn on the tongue, but it dies quickly to the center of the tongue, a little sour.  The finish is not rich, but there is finally a little peaty sea breeze and a little dusky oak.  Others comment on sweetness, but I don’t get that, except a little in the finish.  Not a bad pour, distinctive and unusual profile.  But it does not present the complexity or depth I recall from other Jurassic I recall."

null,like tar and burnt leather..in a bad way. I've not been to Brooklyn but this is what I imagine an alley there would taste like.

3.75,"Not the old, oily Jura I remember, but a nice, slightly sweet yet peaty dram. Pleasant and an easy drinker"
