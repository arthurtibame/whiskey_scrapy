4.0,Surprisingly good for such a young bourbon. Having lived in the Vail Valley in the past I only expected this to be a nostalgic purchase after a recent rerun trip 20 years after leaving. Pleasantly surprised by the smoothness of this one. Doesn't have a great nose but is deceptively delicious to me.

4.0,"New and actually very complex and smooth. Has a nice vanilla and oak taste. It has a good finish that is light and sweet. Maybe a bit harsh, but that is fleeting."

3.0,10th Mountain is an outstanding bourbon for the price and time that it is aged. The nose is kind of strong but the taste is delicious with spices. I think I taste a tad bit of cinnamon and maybe some mint. Absolutely recommend if available ].
