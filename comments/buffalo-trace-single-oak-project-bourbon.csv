null,"For those who may not know this, Buffalo Trace did a bunch of experiments and then bottled them in 375ml bottles and are charging a fairly premium price.  The bottles all have barrel numbers on them so reviews will be for specific barrel numbers.  There's an entire singleoakproject website to talk about what this is.  Just clarifying it's not a single bottle/flavor profile - so these ratings and reviews are all going to vary widely!"

Very cool to try these projects & experiments from Buffalo Trace as well as other distillers.
Nose is oaky, fruity, some spice, some rye...
Palate tasty, rye, not thin
Finish, a little hot, long, pleasant
Note: Thus far all my tastes to date are at room temp and neet. No water ever added but utilized between tastes of each pour as palate cleanser."
4.25,Barrel 191. Solid pour nose was my favorite part

null,Cracked open barrel number 52 for Memorial Day.  A fragrant nose that reminded me of a bouquet of flowers.  The initial taste was sweet.  This bourbon is smooth as a baby's behind and an easy drinker.  I give it an A for effort but honestly when I pay this much for a bourbon I expect a tad bit more of an impression.

5.0,Bold and over the top bourbon with a bottomless pit of flavor. Pairs well with over smoked meat.
5.0,Just got four bottles of this at work and was fortunate enough to try it out. By far the best bourbon I've had in a very long time. They're doing great things at Buffalo Trace.  Absolutely worth the price tag on the bottle. Bonus: each 375mL has a unique taste and is labeled according to which barrel is was batched in. A truly unique experience.

3.0,"Barrel #124
Wheated bourbon with lots of sweet caramel. You get a lot of oak on the long finish. A classic wheated bourbon profile, very similar to Old Weller Antique."
4.0,"Enjoyed the Barrel #84, hits of vanilla and cinnamon w a slightly oily mouth. Will be looking forward to trying some of the other releases."
