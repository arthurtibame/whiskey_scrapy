5.0,Nuance is the key here. For 103 proof this stuff is exceptionally balanced! The nose finds tropical fruits of mango and passion fruit with sweet grain. The palate is crown goodness with rye and cereal and the afore mentioned fruit. The finish is medium with fruit and sweet grain. A delightful dram for all but especially for the crown fans.

5.0,"I bought this bottle on a whim, and I'm very, very glad I did.  Normally I work my way up a particular product line, starting in the mid-range and going up until the price increases don't match the quality or flavor increases. (I also work my way down, but that's another story).  The only CR products I'd ever had are the original, and CR Black.  Based on those alone, I never would have thought this was going to be as good as it is.  Include the Northern Harvest Rye, which is a decent dram, and I still wouldn't have thought this would be as good as it is.  Truth be told, I probably wouldn't have bought it, and then I'd not know how good it is, and that would just be sad all around.  Anyway...the review:  This smells of a winter morning bakery; French toast, cinnamon rolls, vanilla icing...if you're getting sweet, you're on the right track.  The palate continues the sugar-overload, but instead of the breadiness you'd expect from the smell, you get warm and rich, caramel, butterscotch and toffee in a very thick, very rich, mouth-coating drink.  A hint of baking spices closes this one out, fading to a pleasant sweet alcohol burn that lingers for a few minutes.  Did I mention that it's rich?  And creamy?  And rich?  I'm amazed this came out of Canada, and even more amazed that it's Crown Royal.  Incredible.  Well done Diageo.  Now don't screw it up."

4.0,"The first thing to note about this whisky is the fact where you are depends on what barrel you get. On each box is a sticker that says ""Bottled exclusively for __________"" Mine I picked up when I was traveling through ""The Bull City: Durham NC"". And with every single barrel selection, the notes I give will not be indicative of say New York, Idaho, Texas, or even city to city with in North Carolina. A few underlying notes should be similar but each barrel should have its own character as well. As stated above this is the Durham release which is bottled at 51.5%, 103 Proof. Resting neat in a small brandy glass.
      
      Nose: Strong, spice (cinnamon and basil) and burlap, ethanol and rye, a bit of sweet maltyness in the back, a touch of citrus.
      
      Pallet: Oily, Bitter, burlap and leather, drying, sweetness develops honey, and burned suger, spice builds in after quite quickly, rye, and cinnamon, very hot.
      
      Finish: Charred wood, malt, dark chocolate, black pepper on the cheeks, leather, medium long finish.
    
    I would love to know where the bottles people reviewing this are from.
  
  Edit: after a few glasses of this whisky I can see where ""mango"" and other fresh fruits are coming from. The more I drink this whisky the more complex it becomes it. This will not change my score but will underline how impressive this whisky is."

5.0,Great nose and taste of butterscotch and vanilla. High alcohol content isn't a problem. Really enjoyed it

3.0,"Ok.. I'm surprised at how solid this actually is. Nose...not much happening. Sweet. Some caramel, apple. Palate however is pleasant. Caramel apple, vanilla. Quite lovely. Much better than the original. Now, I drank whistle pig 10 after, and yea...it blew this shit away, but this was solid. The finish is where it just has nothing really. Ok, the nose and finish are next to nothing haha. Still though, much better than I had expected."

4.0,"I have usually overlooked Crown Royal products partly due to lack of interest but mainly because of my limited exposure and perception that most Canadian whiskies are uninteresting (i.e. Canadian Club) and only good for mixing.  Then, through a sample kindly provided by Pranay, I have been pleasantly surprised and found a quality Canadian whiskey and one that I will look to add to my collection. 
  The nose of this dram is is what you find at a country breakfast: Frosted Flakes, Brioche French Toast with confectioners sugar, maple syrup with a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg.  It arrives in a rich body, slightly hot, which delivers butterscotch and baking spices.  Finishes almost as it arrives, sweet and spice with a touch of oak,  Add a small amount of water and that initial burn is softened and the sweetness is enhanced.  The palate, however, is slightly bitter.  A dram that suits well, in my mind, during the fall season as an after dinner sipper to finish of a good Sunday meal.  [Dry glass: caramel and marshmallows][91/100][Tasted: 9/25/16]"

4.0,"If it wasn't for the fact that I've had their Noble Collection, I'd have listed this as ""5"" stars.  Really superbly made.  Smells like I just walked into a bakery during a cold blistery day.  Maple syrup, cinnamon, nutmeg.  Taste follows with that of sweet bread basket, warm right out of the oven.  It's good...and a great VFM.   If I had to go back and rate the three CRs I've had so far, I'd list Noble Collection as best by far, followed by this, and then the Northern Rye in a distant third.  CR is doing everything so right...this isn't your father's era CR, something totally different.  And much better."

3.75,"Very good whiskey. Nothing crazy on the nose (faint hint of pickle, but maybe there's something going on with my sense of smell?), light and inoffensive until the eye spice takes over for the finish. Spice & gentle heat really linger on the palate. I would buy again."
4.0,"The nose is gentle considering it’s alcohol level, with soft oak, vanilla, butterscotch, rye, and hints of mint, lemon and gingerbread. It coats the mouth gently with oak and caramel which turns into a creamy butterscotch with gingerbread, baking spices and a bit of vanilla and maple. The finish lingers with fading baking spices and pepper that leave the mouth tingling, along with the slightest bit of mint and maple underneath vanilla and green apple. Slightly complex and excellent."

3.25,"Sweet sweet sweet then more sweet. You got molasses, toasted brown, syrup. Then the 51.5% kicks it. Peppery alcohol is there but not insane. Length is good, finish is good.  Overall I am glad I ran into this when down in TX at Specs, but won’t get another at 56 bucks.  Not a 93 in my book."

3.75,"Well balanced. Nose of sweetness honey, maybe some vanilla and maple syrup even. Taste is not near as sweet with a subtle bite to it but do get some sweeter notes. Priced in my area between 40 - 55$"
