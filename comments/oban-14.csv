3.5,"info: Embouteillage à 43%. Je ne vois pas de mention relativement à l'ajout de colorant ou du filtrage à froid. Un 14 ans d'âge, l'expression classique de la distillerie. Définitivement peu d'information disponible pour ce scotch... Dommage.

Nez: Miel. Sel et céréale.

Bouche: Pas grand chose de plus qu'au nez. Le sel est plus présent en bouche. Bien balancé en bouche. Pas complètement doux ni harsh en bouche. Intensité moyenne. Une texture suffisamment grasse. Des fruits? peut-être des poires sûr. Un zeste de citron amer et persistent. 

finale: Définitivement sur l'orge salé. Des céréales Corn flakes. 

Overall: Autant j'ai adoré le Oban DE, autant je trouve le 14 ordinaire. Un peu fade. Probablement trop dilué pour dégagé son potentiel. Mais, c'est grand publique. Accessible à plusieurs amateur. à 110$ CAD, je ne trouve pas que c'est une bonne valeur côté rapport qualité/prix. À gouter, ça c'est sur. acheter? peut-être pas pour tout le monde. Du moins, ce n'est pas pour moi même si ce n'est pas un mauvais produit pour autant. 71%"
3.75,"Nose isn't aggressive, has wafting pear, cereal, and floral notes on the nose. A tad of water and time added a slight butterscotch. The taste was a little thin for my taste. what is there is a nice continuation of the floral or herbal notes, with a little wisp of smoke. Finish is a bit spicy, and lingers nicely"

2.75,"Lightly peated (2-3 ppm) the nose is bright with a caramelized sweet but slightly aggressive fruit. The palate was lacking, some earthy notes, darker flavors that were hard to distinguish. No peat till the backend, and on swallowing the peat shows it’s face again coming up through the nostrils. The finish is slightly smoky, but seemed to lack in other flavor notes. Decent, and a good little initiation into peat, but way to overpriced for me to return to.

Not oily and beautiful straw color

N: White fruits, Sweet, very light peat

P: Sweet Fruity notes upfront, peat pulls forward with Salty textures as its sits on the tongue.

F: Smooth but almost short. Peat and a slight sweetness lingers. 

Great for intro drinkers as they note. Especially for intro to Islay/peated scotch.

Love the Highland/Isle characteristics it's delivers. 

Epitome of a coastal scotch."

4.0,"One of the commonly found mid range whiskies along with Lagavulin, and find similarities between the two. Although from the Highland, Oban’s complexity is reminiscent of a mellow Islay where the peat is integral to the whisky rather than standing out. Easy drinking whisky with no need for water. 

The nose has some sweetness in honey and tropical fruits but tempered by the bourbon cask. The taste is smooth with some of the citrus, with embedded peat and backed by the bourbon cask. Finish is dry with some lingering saltiness.

Difficult to fault it for the price, unless you are looking for more pronounced smoke or cask influence."

3.5,"Retasted, 19 May 2019. Bottle recently opened, now about 3/4 full.

Nose: A light cereal aroma with green apple notes, hints of English mustard, a little leathery honey and the merest hint of smoke (but I wouldn't characterize this as a ""smoky"" whisky at all). There's a vanilla presence but it's not a dense flowery vanilla - something more cereal, like the smell of freshly baked vanilla sponge cake. With water the nose becomes more fragrant.

Palate: A sweet malty arrival that develops some pleasant ginger and Dijon mustard spice notes together with a very light maritime hint in the later palate. Dry sherry, walnut oil, and the same savory-vanilla presence as on the nose. Water brings out a little extra sweetness, and is recommended.

Finish: Medium/long. Sweet cereal that turns to a dry briny/malty aftertaste that lingers more than you might at first suspect.

A clean, well-balanced profile that does not disappoint. Oban 14 is one of those perfectly acceptable whiskies that you enjoy but for some reason always reach past on the shelf in order to grab something else.  It is a slow malt to open so give it a good rest in the glass before tasting and I'd recommend a few drops of water. This opens everything, but particularly improves the finish.

One thing I did notice from this retaste is the apple note, which is almost like cider vinegar on both the nose and palate. Not that it's a fault at all - it adds to the spicy part of the profile and gives the whisky a light and sprightly character. It also teams well with the unique mustardy-maritime note, which is reminiscent of salt marshes or estuarine low-tides.

The last time I tasted this was at the distillery where it made an OK but hardly memorable impression, however it's possible that as the starter of a flight of whiskies it simply stood out as the least impressive dram. I'm increasing my previous rating slightly.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars."

3.0,"So after having multiple pours of this malt over the last year, I finally decided to pick a bottle up a couple months back. I have now got thru a solid third of the bottle and feel like I am in a good place to review it. So why wait so long to get around to a review? Honestly, this is one of those Whisky's that's hard to figure bout how much you like it. It's really easy to drink. Very pleasant, but sometimes you think ""I tell you what this is a proper dram"" and then others you are left very underwhelmed. Let's dive in to the tasting notes:
As noted above the entry is soft and slightly buttery with bright apples, honey and orange candy. Mid palette adds citrus, toffee with smoke in the background leading to medium finish that is much the same. The finish is a bit of a let down but again the overall pour is nice. Good balance, and fairly well constructed. 
So again there is nothing bad about it, just nothing special about it either. For the price paid it's an ok value. 
I think a 3/5 is a fair score. Definitely one to try at a bar first before you buy. A good one for those just getting into Scotch and wanting to dip your toes in a Peated profile. 
Cheers all!"

4.0,"I’m one of those folks who likes Oban. There, I got that off my chest. 

The nose of Oban 14 is provocative - an alluring blend of figs, a sweetness like white chocolate fudge, a gentle smoke (like a pleasant candle that was recently blown out), and a whiff of the sea. 

The palate delivers - more figs, the sweetness becomes honey, followed by spice, smoke, and sea salted malt. It’s a rich dram with a smooth mouthfeel. 

The finish is long and wonderfully balanced: fruit, sweets, (light) peat, and dry wood bow out. 

The fruit/sweet/malt/smoke/salt balance really works for me as a great dram for capturing summer ending and fall beginning. It’s a little lower on the VFM scale at ~$60 per bottle, but I find that easier to overlook given the distillery and the whisky’s unique character. I haven’t tasted anything else quite like it. 

And then it leaves me wanting another taste.  Which I will gladly pour.  Sláinte!

4.0,"Subdued on the nose; slightly fruity. Pears with a slight peat, a hint of roasted barely.  Not much on the tip of the tongue, but as the whisky rolls over the tongue the flavors reveal themselves. Warm fruit, maybe a tad bit of vanilla and just a hint of peat. Welcoming without overstaying its welcome; not too long of a finish."

4.0,"I bought this bottle back in August and have been getting to know it over the last couple of months. I have seen some reviews that say this whisky is simple, a good beginner scotch. It might make a good beginner scotch in that it’s not overwhelming in any way, but I found it far from simple. 

Oban is located on the western coast of Scotland. The distillery is “208 steps from the sea” according to their website. It is one of the smallest distilleries in Scotland, having only two stills and just seven employees.  But from this tiny distillery comes one of the classic malts of Scotland, Oban 14. 

This whisky is bottled at 43% ABV and pours a bright gold in the glass. Giving it a swirl produces an oily coating and long slow legs. No indication of non-chill filtering, so I’m assuming it is. 

On the nose there is briny barley. Not that strong floral barley that characterizes most scotch. This is subtle, subdued, but in a good way. There is also some honey, light fruits, and hints of peat and lemon zest. This whisky makes you work to get much out of the nose, but what there is is very pleasant. 

The palate is much more assertive than the nose. There is light sweet honey, malty biscuits, black tea, brine, light peat smoke. An earthiness I’ve not really found in any other whisky. It’s oily and at times slightly medicinal with a fairly thick mouthfeel. Again, many reviewers have claimed this is a simple whisky but I found it complex and somewhat challenging. 

The finish is moderately long with warm briny biscuit, oak, and whiffs of smoke like burning leaves on a fall afternoon. 

Overall I really like this dram; I found it to be unique and complex. And at $55 online, a great value as well. Highly recommended. 4/5. Cheers!"

Palate- more light and fruity flavors like honey and green apples, with a tinge of bitter. Some earthy and very slightly smoky notes drive the back end and the finish, a light salty and brined flavor runs all the way through the palate. 

All in all a very enjoyable whisky. Can change dramatically based on what came before the tasting, so trying different pairings and drinking in different settings is recommended to find the way you like it best.

Nose: still Some pineapple, but also stewed apricots. We have bee hives so definitely warm comb-honey.  Green apples, pear, black tea, wine with botrytis, maybe a little leather and wet slate. 

Taste: Honeydew melon, cardamom, poached pear and vanilla.   Floral - elderflower, then sauternes, dark fruit.  Then a faint bit of smoked meat if you searched your tongue for it. Then a wee bit of peat arose to go as  quickly.  Only problem is that as soon as you start to open it up it’s gone."

I just went though my collection and I’m adding in tastings that must have slipped though the cracks. While I prefer bourbon, whiskey in general is still delicious and this one is no slouch. For a peated whiskey, not a whole lot of that peat makes an appearance in the nose or the palate which is a plus in my book. I’m not a huge fan of the overpowering peat so I guess thats just whats I likes about this whiskey!"

Bottled at 43%abv, with an amber color.

On the nose you get this Salty aroma, which prevails over the other notes. Tobacco, brown sugar and a slight peatyness is also present.

On the palate is delicious, with caramel, old banana, ashes, oaky hotness notes with a very very long salty finish. Medium bodied.

Overall i give this one an 83 over 100, because the nose is not that great and it can be a little harsh for some people. Cheers!"

It is quite gentle, reminiscent of Aberlour 12 more than Springbank 10 or Old Pulteney 12, which it gets compared to often. I ended up paying $100 for it, but wouldn't do it again. Given how long I've been wanting to try, found it a tad underwhelming"

I'll serve it to people I like but don't know very well, or perhaps ones I know but don't like very well. The palate is short-lived, like a pretty cloud in the sky or Donald Trump's political career. Definitely not worth the price. Spend the money on an Aberlour, a good steak, or a decent video game."
