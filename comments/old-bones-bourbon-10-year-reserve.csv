4.0,"Strong and hot nose. Darker molasses color. Rich caramel. First sip is apple pie, cinnamon, caramel and a caramel slight vanilla finish. A few drops opened up the nose and finish, bit more vanilla and brown sugar notes. Very good. Hot on the finish unless you let it open up a bit or give it a drizzle of water. Compared to Rebel Yell 10yr, less oak notes and a bit more vanilla. I prefer over RY. 

Half bottle update: tempted to up this to 90+ rating, it's opening up really well. Much less hot, much more flavors. If I find another bottle (for sub ~$75) I'd absolutely buy again."

3.0,"Smells like... MGP. Strong on the nose, seems hot. Rich caramel. On the tongue, not as hot as the nose suggests, although it is hot. A bit astringent. Some apple. Cinnamon. Flavors seem muted. A few drops opened up the nose, more fruit. Opens up the palate as well, makes it sweeter and less dry. 1/25/18"
