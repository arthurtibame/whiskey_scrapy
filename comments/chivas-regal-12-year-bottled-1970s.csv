2.75,"Found a super old bottle of this at my grandparent’s house. What a piece of history! Didn’t realize it was from the 70s. The bottle design is fantastic and intricate. 

A very interesting first sip—I can’t tell if it‘s due to not being stored properly or if this was how it’s meant to taste, but it has an incredibly strong bite right off the bat, more so than even most bourbons I’ve had. I would never think this was a Scotch. Once the bitter heat fades, it transforms into a wave of salt, caramel, and mushroom. 

Not my favorite whiskey, but as always, better to have tried it than to not have drank at all!"
3.75,"Bottled for the British Armed Forces in the 1970s, this old version of Chivas Regal 12 was discovered in a musty basement after four decades of storage. What secrets does it hold? A bit reluctant at first, the aroma reveals tinned pineapple, shortbread and wood spices. The taste is silky and yet robust, featuring notes of kiwi, cumin and peppery licorice. Quality casks are shining through, not the inferior refill casks they use for most blends nowadays. Creamy vanilla, roasted nuts and a dash of oak fade in semidry and lingering finish. What a blast from the past!
