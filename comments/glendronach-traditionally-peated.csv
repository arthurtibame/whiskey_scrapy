3.75,"Nose: a nice subtle peat with a equally balanced fruitiness. Also marzipan, nutty chocolate, later fresh ground coffee and more dark chocolate and soft dates.

Palate: super sweet with a gentle peat, very smooth and while still very flavorful more on the light side of intensity (but not at all weak - just gentle) also some very nice oaky cask character.

A very round and well combined whisky. This is one of those few whiskies that get better with every sip. There is not much this one doesn’t offer. I really like it especially because of the mild peat note. Glendronach doesn’t usually do peated whiskies as far as I understand it - they really should - works really well together with their base character."
