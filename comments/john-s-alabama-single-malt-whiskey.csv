4.0,"Nose: orange and lemon citrus, little stone fruit sweetness, orange blossom honey.

Palate: sweet flavors, white peach, very floral, slight lemon cleaner on the back end, and a spicy finish."
4.5,"Smooth, a small peat flavor. I like it still."
3.25,Sweet taste; the hints of peach and pecan really create a buttery taste
3.75,"Cloves strong on the nose.  Fruity, some cinnamon, oak, slight butterscotch and honey.  Not too strong, though alcohol is definitely predominant."
4.25,"Toasted oak,  butterscotch,  and cinnamon on the first taste,  with later sips revealing smoke and cloves."
3.75,"Lovely sweet, spicy, and slightly fruity nose. The palate was definitively southern pecan forward, with a little creme brulee. Nutty finish, but found it incredibly drinkable. Made about 30 minutes from where I grew up. Tasted at the Royal Oyster House in Gulf Shores, Alabama."
