4.0,"The nose is distinctly sweet and fruity: I'm greeted by banana and brown sugar. The palate lends more of this along with vanilla, cinnamon, coffee, molasses, clove, maple syrup, and a touch of smoke. Despite the sweetness the finish is long and dry with fruit returning to the forefront in the form of apple and pear. This one is fun to pick apart for the patient sipper."

4.0,"Bought this at the source. Fantastic staff and facility at Journeyman.

Neat from glencairn. Pours an orangey amber with wafting spice.

Nose is hot pumpkin spice. Leather notes as pepper dances on your tongue. Comforting heat in the finish. A nice spicy sipper. Legs for days.

2.75,"Traveling down a whisk(e)y side path, I happened to acquire a bottle of Not a King Organic Rye Whiskey from Journeyman Distillery. Apparently this bottle features a throwback rye mashbill that was popular in the George Washington era. Without digging deep for facts, I’m pretty sure this is an annual February release to coincide with the Pres Day holiday.

Pouring a really nice orange-tinted color, the aroma from the glencairn is a youthful combo of rye bread, spices, and fruit notes. The palate is a heavy syrup of maraschino cherries and triaminic with some lingering pepper. While it delivers a decent rye spiciness and warmth, there’s not really any memorable qualities. I’d call it middle of the pack even though my bank of ryes to compare it to is admittedly thin. Had higher expectations.

Rating: the 91 score from Distiller is super generous as I’d lean low 80s - worth a pour but probably not a bottle. Journeyman is commendable for using quality ingredients and is one of the main craft distilleries (along with Koval & Wigle) with a stable of organic spirits. In theory, I’d like to offer my continued support but the dilemma is paying $45-$50 for an entirely average product when I can get a higher quality bottle of High West Double Rye (and a bunch of other ryes I haven’t tried) for $10-$20 less. Tough call. Cheers

4.0,"Oak honey banana nose. Taste starts with sweet and spicy strength, banana overtones with some baking spice hints. Some oily/chemical taste present but not unpleasant. Long sweet woody finish with hints of banana."
4.0,The nose is caramel and spice. Great rye taste or spice and black pepper. Smooth finish my favorite of the Journeyman spirits
