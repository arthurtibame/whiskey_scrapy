3.0,"A barrel pick by my favorite local store, Bottle Barn.  3 Year cask strength (107 proof) MGP.  Can't go wrong with anything Jason from Bottle Barn selects.  If you're lucky enough to get one of his Four Roses picks look out!  I'd never heard of Old Pepper Rye.  No surprise seeing as I had to submit for it to be added to Distiller.  I've seen the 10 year bourbon going for WAY too much at my local place but for $40 for a barrel pick rye why not?

Nose: Very grassy spicy notes with vanilla, lemon peel, strong ethanol, and some of that ""too young"" piney whiskey nose.

Flavor: Still a little bit of young pine but sweet and spicy with more herbal grassy notes.  A little bit alcohol forward but big on the sweet heat.

Finish:  Barrel char, black pepper, and then more sweet herbal notes.  Not super hot.

It's a little young with some of those pine notes that indicate it needed more time in barrel but overall it's solid for the price.  A nice sweet and spicy rye with some herbal notes that make it complex and interesting.  I think in a year or two more in barrel this would be dynamite instead of just ok."
