3.5,"Nose: French madeleines dipped in orange oil, no alcohol at all noticeable, vanilla, potato crackers, prickly IPA beer - interesting really. 

The palate is also quite nice. There is light oriental dry spices, orange lemonade, bright nuts, it also has nearly no noticeable alcohol to it and is very sweet and juicy. It would be too light in general but the interesting spice mix gives it a flavor punch. 

Much better than expected. I will see what other Balblairs there are that go a little bid further or maybe even have some peated barley to it."

5.0,Silky smooth with blood orange nose and brown sugar.  This is perfection for unpeated Scotch.  Very creamy mouth feel and vanilla notes with slight citrus finish.  Do not pass this up.

3.5,Nice drop. Continues my average Balblair rating trend 3.5. Nice but nothing special.
