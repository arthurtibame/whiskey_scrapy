Distillery/Blender:	Maker’s Mark
Category:		Kentucky Bourbon
Age Statement:	NAS, at least 5 years 9 months
Proof:			110.9
Mash bill/blend:	<50% corn, unknown % red wheat, no rye

Tasting Date:	05/11/2018
Nose: 17/20
Delicate and sweet, toffee mostly, with some apple and pear nectar, like an estery Belgian witbier, with light coriander overtones. Nothing overly exciting, but nothing harsh, with alcohol well-hidden.
Initial Taste: 14/15
Spritely pop of lemon zest covered in near-burnt sugar. 
Body/Mouthfeel: 6/10
Definitely light and gentle on the palate. It is surprisingly light, with a pretty high viscosity despite how sugar it is. Though, there is very little spice or astringency to speak of, and so the light touch is in concert with the theme of this drink. Some may find it lacking in mouthfeel, expecting it to have a more silky touch for something light and smooth, like a Glenmorangie, but it is definitely consistent with the spritely nature of the drink, and so not entirely a fault.
Taste: 14/15
Zesty, yet creamy lemon curd with citrusy-sweet-tart preserved lemon filling at the bottom, frothy mousse topping, maple drizzle, and chocolate shavings to cap it off with still-milky, yet semi-sweet and slightly toasty piquant cocoa-roundness.
Finish: 16/20
A lovely continuation of the taste, with a bit of something like the sip of mild espresso and biscotti and lemon peel you had to wash down the last bit of lemon curd. It fades after a bit because of the light touch, but it makes it very easy to sip frequently and quietly.
Value: 6/10
Value is hard to speak about. It’s a special bottle, and quite tasty, but some may feel the body in particular is a weak point for something you’d pay over $70 for.
Overall: 7/10
A memorable drink actually. The toffee and lemony crème-brulee-esque combo here with maple sugar sweetness all through works so well, even I enjoy it, and I don’t like sugary-sweet. The persistent lemony character perfectly masks that corn “tang” that often puts a damper on an otherwise fine bourbon. The major drawback here is a mouthfeel on the light side, and a finish that’s also perhaps a bit too delicate for the proof."

4.5,"Great, unique bourbon here. The nose is kind of fruity and light, with strong toffee and a little wood. It is 110 proof, but the alcohol burn seems to have been quelled a bit by Maker's apparently masterful barreling process. At taste, it seems to have a little bit more body than the nose implies. The legs are not thick, but a little long. I don't know how many years this bourbon was aged, but I'm guessing it's a little less than 10 or 12 years. However, it seems to have some developed maturity. As far as I know, maturity is not necessarily dependent on age, so perhaps that could explain it. In any case, it's very nice overall.

Perhaps it's not quite what I know to be ""full-bodied"" bourbon, but the body is substantial considering that it has a rather light, airy taste; not so much as say Basil Hayden, but perhaps something more along the lines of Russell's Reserve if that helps as a reference. It's fairly smooth overall and a subtle rye kick or something like that on the way down.

It has some complexity, and I like how it blossoms with just a few drops of water. This bottle costed me $62 + tax. That's an OK price from what I've tasted, but I've only had a couple of drinks. Right now, it seems more like a $56 bottle, but when I get halfway through the bottle, that might change."

This took a while to open up. On first taste this was underwhelming, initially there was a lot of alcohol on the nose and the palate. A chip of ice and some breathing time improved things greatly.

It definitely has more spice than Maker's 46 (I miss the cherry notes from that), I'm guessing due to the stave selection."

3.0,"This Oak Stave selection is from Kappy's Fine Wine and Spirits, and was bottled at 110.3 proof. For the Kappy's Private Select, 3 seared French Cuvee staves, 4 Maker's 46 staves, 2 Roasted French Mocha staves, and 1 Toasted French Spice stave was used.

Nose: The nose was somewhat subdued. There was just a slight amount of butterscotch and cherry vanilla present, with a little bit of ethanol burn.

Palate: very full bodied at the start, lots of buttered rum, vanilla, and caramel are present with just a touch of cinnamon.

Finish: VERY long finish, which is quite nice/surprising—the tastes where lingering on my tongue and down my throat for a good minute after, likely the result of the Roasted French Mocha staves. The finish was dry, not nearly as oily as standard Maker's Cask Strength, and tasted like dark fruits and chocolate. The best way I can describe it is a poor man's Booker's ""Tommy's Batch"" or and overpriced Noah's Mill — a similar flavor profile but without the burn, and spice that you would normally expect in a higher proof bottling. The finish is definitely better than the initial pallet.

When compared to the lesser expensive Maker's Cask Strength, overall I would give this a 3.5. While it is still a pleasant drink, this particular selection does not quite live up to its asking price. I love that there are at least a thousand different Stave combinations one can choose from and am curious to try a different combination; maybe one with less Maker's 46, and more of the Roasted French Mocha and Toasted French Spice."

5.0,Private selection from Wine Palace of Livonia. 👍👍
4.5,"American whiskey tasting evening, Sydney, 21 September 18. Whiskey #4

Nose: Lots of toffee and caramel and a full, hefty oakiness. There's a sweet berry note like cherries or raspberries, and earthy cinnamon spice and ginger, plus and hint of peanut. Water amplifies the woody notes and also brings out brown sugar, pickle water and a slight minty aroma.

Palate: A sweet honey/caramel arrival that almost instantly develops a huge hot cinnamon, black pepper and chilli spice hit. This persists but is tempered by a sweet fruitiness, as of red berries, that enters from the sidelines as it moves towards the finish. Lots of heavy woody favours. Water brings out notes of nuts and vanilla and tempers the heat.

Finish: Medium/long. The finish is the conclusion of the palate with nothing new emerging. The final flavours are woody and caramel, and a touch of red berries, but it turns slightly dry right at the end with tannic notes that are quite welcome.

This was an appealing whiskey and I returned to it repeatedly throughout the tasting. It held up well against everything but was outclassed by the Woodford Reserve cask strength, which was the final whiskey of the night.

Although there is quite a hot kick in the palate I found it to be very approachable and not at all overbearing, however water improved the experience by generally softening and loosening the profile which allowed a lot of otherwise hidden aromas and flavours to emerge. I'd recommend a good dash of still water for this one, or even an ice cube and wait until the ice is mostly melted.

This expression is available in a myriad forms, as I understand, but the standard stocks in Australia all seem to be the same.  The configuration was selected by Rob Samuels, so I guess it's a middle-of-the-road formulation created in bulk for retail outlets. This batch was 55.9% abv, but I have no idea about the stave selection.

""Excellent"" : 4.5 stars"

3.75,"There have been several releases of the Makers Private Select hitting the Houston area recently, and I've been sampling a few of them. This is one was picked by Nasa Liquor. The stave selection is as follows:

2 x Baked American Pure2
3 x Seared French Cuvee
3 x Makers 46
1 x Roasted French Mocha
1 x Toasted French Spice
110.9 proof/55.45% ABV

This was tasted neat in a Canadian glencairn

Nose - Leads with creamy vanilla, apples, cherries, and graham crackers. More faintly I also get orange peels and varnished oak. The creamy fruit notes actually remind me of the 'V' recipes from Four Roses, but the graham cracker note makes this recognizable as wheated bourbon for me.

Palate - Starts with rich butterscotch, vanilla, and cooked pastry dough. Also some of the same fruit notes from the nose, especially the apple. The sweetness lingers on the finish, where the baking spices finally start to show up.

My only criticism is that I feel like there could be a little more spice; this one is all sweetness up front, with the baking spices arriving a little too late to keep things balanced. 

Overall I liked this one quite a bit. I definitely seem to have a preference for the selections that are heavier on the first 3 stave choices, with the French Mocha and French Spice used sparingly (the first Private Select I tried was a 0/0/2/4/4, and it was just too bitter and tannic)."

5.0,"This is my second time reviewing this bourbon because each Maker’s Private Select is different. Maker’s Private Select is, in general, my favorite bourbon because of the complexity and smoothness coupled with the unique finishing process done by makers. My other recent review touches on that. This particular bourbon has the following finishing staves:
1 Baked American Pure 2 stave
1 Seared French Cuvée stage
2 Maker’s 46 stave
3 Roasted French Mocha stave
3 Toasted French Spice stave
This particular combination gives way to a balance between vanilla, spice, and sweetness. This isn’t quite as good as the one I recently reviewed because of my personal preferences, but it is still a very good whisky. This bourbon has some burnt smoke notes coupled with some cooking spices as well as subtle cooked vanilla flavors. Very delicious considering how unique it is compared to other bourbons. Considering this is 1/1,001 stave combinations offered by Maker’s Private Select, it is very good and is special in its own right."

2 Maker’s 46 staves
7 Roasted French Mocha staves
1 Toasted French Spice stave
This produces an extremely sweet flavor on the nose and palate. The sweetness has a milk chocolate-like feel to it from the French Mocha staves. Behind the sweetness is some spice from the Maker’s 46 staves and some smooth and elegant spice from the Toasted French spice. To top it off these are all bottle at cask strength to get the full experience. Really truly delicious. I’ve been to the Maker’s Mark distillery where they offer different Private Selects and those are equally delicious with their own character."

Nose: (3.75) Cherry dominates with some oak and clover honey. Cinnamon is in the background  Almost reminds me of a cherry coughdrop.  That bit of syrupiness on the nose plays a bit medicinal but doesnt dominate what overall is pretty good.

Palate (3.75):  This is a cinnamon bomb.  Didnt expect that at all.  Spicy sweet red-hots, and Big Red chewing gum.  It's good, not great but is something way out of the league from standard maker's mark.  If you are making a true hot-toddy you want this.

Finish (4.0)  Well executed and long.  The cinnamon carry's through and finished a bit more like a toasted cinnamon bun.  I like this better than the initial palate.

Overall:  Pleasant departure from the ho hum wheater that standard Maker's Mark can be.  This was interesting and definately worth a try.  The 79.99 price tag though is a bit of a price to pay for a cinnamon lover's delight.  Get a sample like I did before buying the bottle."

Thick, syrupy and oily texture. Brown sugar all over the top of the tongue, gives way to that spice and cinnamon on the tongue.  Tons of spice and vanilla on the close with decent legs.

Such a good wheater.  Rivals Antique all day long."
3.75,"Calvert Woodley Custom Barrel 2018.  110.2 proof.  Finishing staves: four Seared French Cuvee, two Maker's 46, four Roasted French Mocha.  Purchased on 6/13/19 at Calvert Woodley DC for National Bourbon Day 2019.  Poured neat into Glencairn at home.  Nose is full of butterscotch and caramel, some oak and spice, vanilla, soft grains.  Heat is well hidden for the proof.  Taste lets the cacao in, with leather and tobacco.  Interesting interplay of top end spice and low end dark notes of cacao and figs.  Don't love it, but certainly appreciate it, nice custom variation on the MM Cask Strength.  6/13/19."

3.75,"Its good but doesn't blow me away. Beautiful bottle but the worst cheapy cap not just on a whiskey bottle but any kind of bottle I have experienced in my lifetime. (Don't ask how old I am ) The cheapy plastic cap is only 3/8"" tall and  hard to grip!When you buy this bottle its beautiful with the bottle and cap covered in the red wax dip. Once you take off the ""Pull String"" to open the bottle it breaks the red wax in a rough manner and leaves a jagged edge that actually irritates your experience of opening the bottle.Then once half the wax is gone from the edges of the cap it leaves you with this super cheap short plastic cap thats not so easy to grab onto and gives one the feeling of cheapness. I can't believe this cap got thru the design process when the whiskey and bottle are pretty nice. Are you listening Makers Mark???"

3x Seared French Cuvee, Maker's 46, Roasted French Mocha
1x Toasted French Spice

Nose - (w/o water) Sweet vanilla, gentle cinnamon, hint of chocolate, caramel, sweet brioche, vanilla frosting (w/ water) More sharp vanilla sweet, more caramel, less chocolate

Taste - (w/o water) Buttery/oily mouthfeel that transitions to a lightly dry leather, sweet buttery vanilla caramel, hint of cinnamon, mocha foam, faint hint of sweet cherries (w/ water) A lot thinner/drier mouthfeel, drying oak, cinnamon heat, oaky caramel

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering waxy/buttery mouthfeel, sweet caramel, light caramel mocha, sharp sweet cherry (w/ water) Lingering drying mouthfeel, brown simple sweet, chocolate returns

Score - 81/100

Final Thoughts - So this one does not really do very well with the addition of water as it seems to throw everything off balance. This drinks surprisingly below its proof neat. That being said, it doesn't taste that much different from standard Maker's even with all of the finishing staves. The only benefit is that it's slightly higher proof and doesn't drink like it. Sadly the addition of water kind of throws it off balance so not sure how this would do in a cocktail.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - Not another"

5.0,"Begin disclaimers.

On a previous review, I stated that Trail Inn/Triangle should give me this bottle for free, seeing as how I’m reviewing their other store picks on an app with a super limited following and zero impact on their business model. Inexplicably, they did not in fact meet this request, which they probably never heard, and I paid full retail for this bottle. I find these terms completely unacceptable and am concerned my poor purchasing experience could negatively flavor my review of this fine bottle.

End disclaimers.

Things I didn’t know prior to purchase:

They take makers mark barrel strength and screw with it. They stick in 10 staves out of 5 categories, options in this case being “Baked American Pure 2,” “Seared French Cuvée,” “Makers 46,” “Roasted French Mocha,” and “Toasted French Spice.” I’m not sure what gives the staves those names, but in this case Trail Inn/Triangle picked:

2 Baked American Pure 2
4 Makers 46
2 Roasted French Mocha
2 Toasted French Spice

Bottle comes in at 108.1 proof.

Another thing I appreciated about this purchase is that it came with a candid admission from the barrel picker. The panel of 15 had it narrowed down to 2 barrels. One of them was very super interesting, and the other was more approachable. They shrewdly went with the more approachable version, but it makes one wonder...

Nose gives off heavy baking spices. I get cinnamon and vanilla. Brown sugar too. That nose is very busy, in a good way.

Body is very chocolatey. A bit of powdered sugar, but it’s hard to get past that chocolate. It’s good, just dominating.

Finish had a bit of cinnamon, and tons of chocolate. A slight bitterness there too, which on its own might seem nutty or leathery. In this context, it just melts into that chocolate. The heat carries longer than you’d expect, and keeps the flavors alive on your tongue. I really like that finish.

Overall my impression of this is a chocolate bomb. It’s good neat, and I could see it being epic in certain cocktails. If you see a 2-0-4-2-2 pick, I highly recommend. I’m also now very excited to try other combinations to see what others have selected. Perhaps one day I’ll find that super interesting yet too risky runner-up barrel."

Neat from a Glencairn glass. Bottle has been open for a few months. 

Nose is oak, corn, baked bread, maple syrup, vanilla. Something slightly herbal in there Sweet, woodsy scent. 

Heavy oak, charred spices on the palate with burnt caramel and brown sugar. Something herbal again but can’t quite put my finger on it. Oily but not too thick. 

Heavy oak and spice on the medium long finish. That oak just lingers on the tongue, reminds me of Woodford Double Oak with a coffee like taste that hangs around. 

Conclusion: Very oak forward, spicy bourbon with minimal sweetness. Something different for the shelf but slightly overpriced IMO."

Wow this is a stellar choice of flavor. Nose is candy. Super sweet. Certainly get the sweet scent of the French mocha. Taste is a lot of char/barrel toast flavor. with a lot of bite on the tongue. Goes down smooth for 110.5 proof but certainly not “smooth”. A contradiction, yes, but any bourbon drinker should understand. Sits on the palette but great flavors.

The staves they chose are: 2x 46, 6x Roasted French Mocha, and 2x Toasted French Spice.

I’m excited to try this after having the regular Maker’s 46 and loving it.
I’m also going to do a side by side with regular makers, 46 and this private select.

The nose definitely has some oak going on, with baking spices, some sweetness, a little vanilla and some corn and dark fruit on the tail end.

The palate has a really nice thickness to it. I definitely get a lot of oak and leather along with some musty barn which I love. I also get some corn in there too.
It’s sweet too, but just the right amount for me. 

The finish is long with a little burn, but really nice.

I really like this store pick. It’s definitely reminiscent of the 46, but with its higher proof and different oak staves, the private select has its own somewhat unique profile. Though on the initial side-by-side, I think I like where the 46 goes a little more than the Private Select."

I was wrong.  This is an incredibly well-balanced bourbon.  Still puts sweetness forward but it's a three-dimensional Scotch-like sweetness with an undertone of ethanol burn.  Finish is oak and tobacco with a backend of vanilla and dried fruit, all with just the right amount of heat.  Will definitely return to this one.

4.5,"So with the Private Select, Maker's allows the customer to decide on their own combination of staves. My local liquor store did this one, and here's how it looks.

3 Baked American Pure 2
4 Seared French Cuvee
1 Maker's 46
2 Roasted French Mocha
0 Toasted French Spice; bottle at 54.9%

Nose: Brown sugar, maple, caramel pop out of the glass. Behind that are leather and cherry. Some mocha and tobacco notes. After some time in the glass I get toffee. Big oak and some cinnamon from the high ABV. No ethanol. Very good.

Palate: Still brown sugar and caramel heavy. Vanilla and what I'll call a carrot cake note. Mocha and roasted nut. The mid palate manifests as major oak and baking spices. Clove, nutmeg, and a massive cinnamon kick. Once again, awesome.

Finish: A bit of the carrot cake and black cherry persists from the palate until they are ultimately swept away by a tide of baking spices. Cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. The oak note is a bit more bitter and astringent at this point but it's still a damn fine finish. Moderate to long.

Damn fine pour right here. My local store, as always, has done me well with this one. I imagine that one might have a wildly different experience with this, depending on the stave selection. I'm a huge fan of the 46, and I'm surprised to see that I enjoyed this as much as I did considering the low percentage of 46 staves.

At $70, it's far from cheap. Yet, considering this is a high-quality, heavy-hitting experimental product, it's worth the money. I'll give it a 4.5. Fine job here, Maker's."

I enjoyed the extra French oak stave finishing from Maker's 46, but I wanted more of it and Maker's 46 Cask Strength Private Select delivered. This whiskey is dangerously good. Be warned, the extra proof is not noticeable and you need to be careful.

On the nose, this does not smell different than the standard Maker's 46. The traditional bourbon vanilla sweetness and oak are still present, but not overwhelming. Surprisingly, even at 110.8 proof the alcohol vapor still is not present.

On the palate, you are bombarded by a wall of flavor. The same Maker's 46 flavors are there but they are complimented with hints of syrup, oak, and raisin bread. Very tasty.

The finish is long and clingy. The vanilla sweetness follows into the finish, along with the oak spice. The alcohol burn is completely absent.

Aggressive nose, quite a nice surprise. Caramel, brown sugar, sweet cherry, nutmeg, and clove. Some leathery oak but its faint at the back end.

Starts things off with a sweet blast of cherry, some Flinstones vitamins, oak, and creme caramel. It coats the tongue quite well and is a great proof with just the right amount of heat. Finish lingers nicely and stays sweet still. Mouth is a little numb. 

The palate compared to the nose was a bit of a let down. This is a situation where the sum of the parts is not greater than the whole.
