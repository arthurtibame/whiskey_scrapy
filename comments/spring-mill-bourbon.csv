2.0,"It's been a while since I had this, but the first thought that comes to my mind is disappointing. A lot of heat, but not really much flavor to go along with it. There's no way I could recommend it."

2.0,A very average bourbon experience. Many better options for the price.
1.0,"Being ""twice barreled"" I was expecting  some level of complexity.  However, I was disappointed to say the least and at $34.99/750ml it was an even greater disappointment. I tried it both neat and with an ice chip. Neither did much.  I really wanted to like this bourbon.  I will give it another chance along with a splash of water.  If I have a better experience I will update my review."

2.0,"Bought at Trader Joe's March, 2018 for $22.95. To my palate, lacking evidence of sufficient aging; tastes closer to corn liquor than all other bourbons I've tried. Very mild flavor, no bitterness, but no complexity.  My preferred bourbons have at least a 51% corn mashbill which is why I tried this one."

3.0,Heavy on the corn and tastes very young. Not something I will buy again. A good mixer.
4.0,This is definitely one of my favorites.  There is a recipe on their website for Bourbon Tea Punch which really highlights the flavor of this bourbon.   It is a citrusy bourbon that I described as spicy sweet.  It’s a little on the expensive side for 750 mls but the flavor is well worth the price
