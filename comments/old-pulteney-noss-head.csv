3.5,"Vanilla, caramel and green apple on the nose.
On the palate it's smooth with a lot of raw wood flavor, grass, caramel. Pretty sweet.
Finish is a bit atomic with caramel dominating. 30 seconds and it's gone."
3.5,"Sweet an citrus on the nose. Briny too. 
Taste with light spices, apples, pear, and a lot of fresh lemon peels and grassy notes. 
aftertaste chocolate, caramel."

3.75,"Nose: Light and fresh, citrus fruits & apples, with cereal notes. Also a vague hint of something ”industrial”, which is hard to pin-point, but not unplessant -> Characterfull. Touch of vanilla. 

Palate: Spirit driven (young) and again fresh. Milky Almonds, apples (or perhaps pears?), and a sweetness well balanced by some salty bitter (but not oaky) undertones.

Finish: The almonds turn into milk chocholate, but with a certain freshness. Medium-long. Like it. 

Overall: Great combination of being light, but yet characterfull. Great when yor not in the mood for a dark complex aged whisky, but still don’t want a ”meh” experience. I just killed my bottle an I may very well pick up a new one next time I travel. Solid 3.75 and very close to an even higher mark."

5.0,"this dram is really in Pulteney style - fresh, sea salt,  lemon, sweet vanila. I'm assume it's a bit young but very good balanced and enjoyable dram."
