2.0,"This LDI-sourced whiskey uses LDI's high-rye recipe, which is definitely how I prefer my bourbon. The tall, thin bottle brings a generic look to the increasingly infamous LDI bourbon. The alcohol hit up front definitely started this pour on a weak note for me. But it settled into a good traditional corn and spice flavor.
        Without the big rye / pepper influence I'm tempted to call this a smooth, easy introductory drink for someone exploring past the Beam hegemony. Instead I'll stick with it being a decent option in the crowded mid-range of the Bourbon world. Perhaps a little over-priced for a common, but enjoyable flavor.

3.0,Smooth pleasant nose. Perfectly balanced taste of bourbon with spicy rye. Somewhat marred by a sharpness that isn't dulled by a bit of water.  Would be good base for a mixer or cocktail.. not great for sipping alone.

3.75,"Nose is spice forward, vanilla, caramel, and musty wood.  I also am reminded of fresh oregano from the garden.

Taste is rye spice, wood, musty grains, and a small amount of vanilla.  

Finish is more rye, flat, but tasty."

null,I was hoping for a little more. It has definite spiciness. Oily that leads to a hint of caramel and sweetness on the end.

5.0,"Redemption High Rye has a lighter amber appearance, with thin alcohol sheeting (not legs). Aroma is of peppery spice and light generalized whiskey aroma, with some bee's wax & honeycomb. Taste is of spiced whiskey, with more spearmint than rye, from my reckoning. Honey and dried flowers show up, too. Mouthfeel is medium, and Redemption High Rye finishes with a quick drop, although there is an underlying pepper rye linger. A bourbon, aged ""no less than one year""? Odd. This new bottle design (2016) has a cork stopper cap and a Bulleit-style medicine bottle. RJT"

2.0,Very disappointed with this one since I like their Rye a lot.  Very little spice for a high Rye mashbill.  I found it boring and very plain. Finnish is almost nonexistent. Will be using this for a mixed only.
3.25,"Found this at a good price (21$$) so elected to get the bottle(proof=92, batch 119) as a high rye bourbon this falls in line with my recent samplings of hi corn ryes, hi rye-corn etc.  Totally by accident of course(wink wink).

  Ryan's front page notes seem pretty spot on,   yes the  ""cinnamon, anise, clove"" rye influence opens up quickly and the late subtle ""undertones of fennel, dill and mint"" eventually arrive.     The complexity and variety for a ""youngin"" is fairly impressive, and the base bourbon stays put to the back ground so to speak. 

Not completely unlike the Old Forester Rye also found at a noteworthy price point as well, there are some interesting rye-corn-malt notes at play in Redemption High Rye that I think totally redeems it in the face of other, pricier,  ""genteel"" ryes and bourbon-rye treatments.  Yes it's Indiana ""heartland"" rye  whiskey and no that should not automatically scare you away.

The fat cork cap bottle is also a nice touch that I always enjoy pouring from, and neat, w/ water or drafted into a OF, Manhattan, Derby or Sidecar look for this bottle at a good price and you won't have gone wrong. Cheers!"

2.5,Mellows quick with ice.  Not very complex.

4.5,Underrated by some. I truly enjoyed this. It is sweet which I assume is the bourbon side. There is a strong note of honey. The rye side makes it a very easy drink especially on ice. I think putting it on ice makes it better. It almost cuts it so to speak. There are also notes of vanilla. True vanilla extract. Comparable to crown Royal IMO. Could be a go to of mine from here on out.

4.0,"I have has the opportunity to try this offering from Redemption and while not the best I have ever had it is a solid Bourbon and its flavor is quite pleasant. I bought this a few weeks ago and did not know what to expect so here goes the review. It has a lighter color than Henry McKenna BiB or Evan Williams BiB and the nose is not as sweet. It reminds me of David Nicholson Reserve they are both spicey and robust Bourbons. It makes a very solid Old Fashioned and Manhatten however, it is a little young to sip in the summer. Overall this is a very good choice for a home bar or as a substitute for some Rye whiskeys. I do not see it very often around where I live but I will buy it again as space comes available in my bar."
