4.0,"What a spectacular nose - super creamy vanilla, with a dash of peppercorn, the most delicious creme brûlée imaginable. With time, notes of black tea emerge. The experience doesn’t quite hold up in the mouth - a preponderance of peppery spices makes for a more simplistic profile, accented mainly by hints of dark marmalade. The finish is lovely though, sweet and sour, a mix of tamarind and ripe plums. Another fascinating slice of Kilkerran’s evolution and a further nod to the mastery that went into the balance of barrels that comprise the 12."
