2.0,Basically Black Velvet. And I love Black Velvet. But not at a 15 yo single malt price...

3.0,"Reminds me if an apple orchard, red apples on the nose and on the palate. Some alcohol bite but still pretty smooth"
5.0,"Whiskey Guild's Whiskey Cruise 2016 - Not much I can write amidst the chaos, but compared to 30 something other whiskies, this particular bottling stood out the most.  I am certainly tracking this one down!"

5.0,"Nose: Citrus zest, green apples, butterscotch
Palate: Butterscotch, pepper spice, apples, vanilla, friend banana
Finish: White pepper, smoke

The creamy butterscotch note explodes the second you take your first sip and it lingers well into the finish and beyond."

3.0,"A serviceable whisky with a wonderful nose that takes a nosedive at the palate and finish.

Apple and carnation with a touch of butterscotch and a generous dose of honey. The predominant aroma is fruit. The body is light and fragile with a lingering bitter finish."

3.0,"On the nose, green apples, freshly squeezed lemon juice, cracked black pepper and a faceful of sea spray. On the palate, a creamy mouth-feel, salty, green apples and lemon with a dash of vanilla essence and wrapping up a little oaky. Leaving it to open up for 15-20 minutes, an interesting sweetness develops, raspberries and raisins. A medium finish, with cloves, cinamon, spice, more oak and a little dry."
4.25,"Nose: Soft, fruity and floral cereal aromas. Waxy honey, apple blossoms, red berries and lots of freshly scraped vanilla pod and caramel toffee. As the nose develops over time in the glass the vanilla and caramel push to the front.

Palate: Soft and creamy arrival with a deluge of honey, sweet malt and vanilla. The development melds these elements into the most delightful butterscotch flavour and also uncovers fruity tones (apple, pear).  There's a flavour component rather like sweet ale (or fermenting wash) but it's not sour or yeasty - just very clean, dulcet and friendly. The texture is rich but crisp and chewy.

Finish: Medium. The lingering aftertaste is of malt and red apple skins, and there's a slight dry edge.

When first poured this whisky is all fruit, honey and cereal but over time the sweeter vanilla and caramel tones become dominant. This could lead to it becoming cloying but it is saved by some subtle oak that lies at the foundation and contributes a spicy balance. There is also a hint of maritime salt to both nose and palate, but it is very understated.

It's a while since I last tasted Glencadam and now I'm wondering why I waited so long. A very pleasing dram that is eminently approachable whilst also having elegance, depth and a profile that is so clean you can almost taste freshly ground barley on the tongue.

Tasted from a 30ml sample.

""Very Good"" : 4.25 stars."
