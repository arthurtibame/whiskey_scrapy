4.0,"Subtle apple, sweet honey, a touch of cinnamon and a wee rye peppery finish. Enjoyable for non-scotch lovers I would suspect, but if you’re a single malt lover you best not be distractible because you might find it overly polite."

3.0,"Honey, barley, heather and vanilla wafers on the nose, slightly grainy and coating palate with honey and vanilla notes, the finish is medium length with the honey and vanilla accompanied by a peppery note. I quite enjoyed the first dram, but midway through the second the nose turned minty, and it developed a bitter after taste."

3.25,"Nose: Fresh apple, banana, vanilla, butterscotch and cinnamon. A dash of oak and pepper as you dig a little deeper.

Taste: Very easy going and friendly. Honey, vanilla and cream, with vibrant green apple. That rye finish offers a little drama at the end as I get some char and pepper.

Overall: Good. Not going to change the life, but a nice background whiskey that has some unique twists because of the rye. Really, it’s a good transition from scotch to bourbon or vice versa if you’re looking to venture into the other side of the whiskey aisle."
