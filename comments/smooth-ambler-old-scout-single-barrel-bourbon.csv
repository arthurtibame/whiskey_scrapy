Nose is wood, hay, cashews. Taste of banana, clove and red raspberries. Rye rises to a long lasting tingle and red pepper spice. Full finish.
Been wanting to try this one and it's not disappointing BUT you have to be a big rye fan to score this whiskey high."

3.0,"16 release is 11 yars and 45.9 proof, kinda short for a cask strength.  Neat, it has a strong ethanol flavor but is farly smooth.  Tastes of heat and vanilla, strong medicinal taste.  Looses alot of heat on ice with a touch of water.  While it is good, I will not classify as great."

4.0,"Another great sample from last night's impromptu bourbon tasting.  This review isn't just for the normal 10 year Old Scout bourbon, this is a single barrel, barrel strength that was bottled exclusively for the online whiskey retailer, Binny's.  The regular 10 year old comes in at an even 100 proof, while this single barrel is just over 117 proof.  

I did try a small pour of the regular 7 year old to establish a baseline and to see how well the extra 3 years goes towards improving this lower-to-bottom shelf bourbon.  I gotta say, the extra 3 years works wonders here.  The nose was still heavy corn, but that's where the similarities to the 7 year stopped.  The palate was very impressive:  there's vanilla, oak, toffee and even a bit of dark berry and cherries.  It was substantially sweeter and incredibly smoother, too.  The 7 year old was harsh and kind of uninviting.  

The finish was a bit short, but pleasant.  I'm not sure how difficult this bottle is to find, or even the price point, but damn it was unexpectedly a highlight of the evening.  I have to keep my eye out for more from these guys.  Good stuff and I recommend you guys to do the same.  If this stuff is around $30-40 a bottle I would consider it a steal.  Cheers."
2.0,A little hot for my preference.
3.0,"Solid proof with a nice classic nose, I get a lot of alcohol and vanilla. The taste left a little to be desired for me, with a smoky flavor that was likely clove but hinted at a peaty scotch. Interesting. Not my favorite, but I can see why others are fans."

3.0,"60.1% ABV, aged 10 years. Smells like floral rye and orchard fruits. Fruit forward on the palate, I get sweet apple juice and some baking spices, then the proof kicks in. It's warm, and the heat fills your chest and lingers, but otherwise the finish is relatively short. After a while, a slight aftertaste of cinnamon and maybe bitter chocolate develops. This is like a tart apple pie. After adding a limestone water ice cube, the nose opens up a bit and I get additional notes of dried apricot and vanilla, and on the palate I definitely get more wood notes. 4/9/17 
Still getting floral rye notes on the nose, there's definitely a sense of walking through a flower or herb garden. The fruit is still there, but there's more vanilla this time around. The palate has developed a distinct cola note, and this still tastes like spiced apple pie. Adding limestone water seems to make it sweeter, and highlights the chocolate/char notes. This is an interesting pour. 4/16/17
10-year SF Whiskey Society from Hard Water SF. Deep caramel, honey, oaky vanilla on the nose. Solid. Nice spice on the end, but disappears, but in a nice way. This is balanced with sugar and spice. Very nice. 5/9/18"

2.0,"[WARNING: Misleading Bait and Switch]  ----   Go for any year but 10yo! The 92 proof 10yo is way too thin, and lacking in flavor other other than oak. It is deceptively advertised as ""Barrel Proof"", when most bourbons are 90 proof and barrel proof is 110-140 proof!! . 
          For some reason it seems that other years (9-yo or 11 yo) are 100+ proof instead. I suggest going for those instead, as this is very thin and lacking in flavor other than oak, with a high pricetag. 
          Also, I wounder why the non-Single Barrel ""Ten"" has higher rating:@ https://distiller.com/spirits/smooth-ambler-old-scout-ten-bourbon-whiskey
        
        The following advertisement regarding Smooth Ambler Old Scout Single Barrel 10 year being awarded the ""best Single Barrel Bourbon in the world"" in 2016 is incredibly misleading:
        http://mountainmessenger.com/worlds-best-single-barrel-bourbon-award-goes-smooth-ambler/
        The actual award referred to is the following ( http://www.worldwhiskiesawards.com/smooth-ambler-old-scout.25979.html ) for a ""106 proof"" Smooth Ambler Single Barrel 10 year, which is quite different from the watered down 92 proof that is currently available. It seems like Old Scout took the award winning Bourbon and watered it down for recent releases with the same exact age and label!"

4.0,"Barrel #2026 - Aged 9 years
Nose - (w/o water) Dark vanilla caramel, oaky cinnamon, oaky vanilla cola, surprisingly little burn for proof (w/ water) Dark toffee, skin-on almonds, oaky cinnamon, dark leather

Taste - (w/o water) Oaky vanilla cola/caramel, cinnamon heat, hint of cherry & cinnamon red hots (w/ water) Brings out more drying oaky vanilla, caramel, light cinnamon, hint of sweet cherry candies

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering cinnamon heat, sweet fruity caramel sweet, vanilla caramels, light drying oak (w/ water) Lingering cherry vanilla, cinnamon heat, more drying somehow

Score - 83/100

Final Thoughts - This drank surprisingly easy for the proof w/o water. The addition of water in this one seemed to help a tiny bit on the palate & opened up a tiny bit more fruity sweet. I have mixed feelings about this one, it drinks quite easy for the proof, but has a pretty ""standard"" nose, palate, finish. Nothing off-putting so that's a plus, but at the same time, nothing that sets it that far apart from other bourbons.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - Maybe since there are single barrel variants?"

4.25,"Neat. Neck pour.  DEPs 5 year pick, 59%, barrel 27718.  Pretzels and caramel brittle.  Intense caramel brittle.  Toffee.  Brine.  Apples.  Great nose.

Texture is quite oily and viscous.  This one is a bit hot and spicy!  Going to need to get acclimated.  Caramel brittle again in the tongue, transitions to intense vanilla, cherry and a hint of cola.  All those flavors remain in the legs, which keep coming in waves.

This is really good.  Maybe a hair below the TPS pick.  Old Scout (and MGP) is back strong with these 5 year picks."
4.5,"Neat. Neck pour. Party Source 5 year at 57%.  Deep caramel, almost to the point of a salted caramel flan.  Very rich.  Gram cracker crust.  Slight green tea note.  Hint of cherry and cream.  That salted caramel really dominates and it’s an impressive note.

Mouth feel is medium with a syrupy granular texture.  Brown sugar and burnt caramel  gives way to an even stronger salted caramel  punch, gram cracker, hint of toffee.  The cherries come back on the legs.

First impression, this is the best young MGP I have.  That rich, vibrant, layered caramel experience isn’t one I recall from other MGP.  There is a hint of the youngness on the nose but no where else.  I’d have to blind this against Mic Drop 3.0 or a Traverse City pick to be sure, but I think this is the best sub-six year MGP I have had.  There was a Backbone 5 year GGG pick that I loved but I don’t think it had flavors this vibrant even at 137 proof.  Nice work on this pick Party Source!"
