2.0,Nose of corn and minimal wood.  Sweet taste from corn.  Few other notes in this young whiskey.  Definitely not complex or balanced.  Finish is short.  WIth this quality it should be priced in the $15 to $20 range; others are much better at any higher price point. Debated giving it only 1 star.

2.0,"Very unappealing bourbon. They should just call it Texas whiskey because it doesn't taste like bourbon.  A fancy name won't fix it.  Just not a fan of these ""bourbons"" coming out of Texas.  Very corn flavored and under aged."

3.0,Corn flavor is primary on the nose. Reminds me at first of Balcones Baby Blue. Very Spicy here. Maybe would hit sweet spot at a better price. Definitely stays smooth and gains complexity when it opens up over ice.
5.0,Incredibly smooth and complex with just the right touch of sweetness and no burn. Awesome find if you can get it

2.0,Tastes of charred corn. Heavy wood tannins for me are too overwhelming. Maybe a little more age will help?  Short finish. Good potential.

4.0,"I get maple, caramel and acetone on the nose.  Creamy mouth feel with vanilla, caramel, buttered popcorn, peanut brittle and butter cookies.  Slight, quick burn on the tongue, faint warming sesation in the throat and chest."
2.75,Bit of a bite. I asked about smoky. Not sure if this is but I like it. Brandon got an Old Fashioned. Very healthy pour.
3.25,Nice tasting bourbon. Nothing exceptional here though.

3.75,Sweet corn on the nose. Not nearly as sweet on the palate. The corn and maple flavors hit early but quickly fades and you’re left with the some astringency like wine. Also comparable to a dryness after eating a handful of nuts. Very different than most bourbons I’ve tried. It’s unique but young. I would love to know how it tastes with more time in the barrel.
