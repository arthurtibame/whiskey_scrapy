5.0,"Tasted it at an American Distillers function in Johannesburg, and managed ti keep the bottle for our bar. Hugely impressed, plenty happening here, complex, opens up very pleasantly with a drop of water."

3.0,"Sampler from Flaviar. Solid rye, vanilla sweet and piney with a warm and woody, medium finish. Quite a bit of alcohol burn. For the price, would probably just go with michter's instead."

2.0,"I've visited Catoctin Creek and found them to be enthusiastic and knowledgeable, and I have high hopes for them.  But at the time we visited (2014), their spirits were still aged for a fairly short time, and it showed--lots of new spirit burn and a particular burn on the nose.  It does have rich, syrup-y flavors with some pepperiness that shows promise, so I look forward to older aged versions of their products."

3.75,There’s a sweetness to this that reminds of corn. Typical rye spiciness is restrained here. Smooth and drinkable. Always an enjoyable visit to the distillery too!
