1.0,An utterly flat and boring replacement for my dearly departed Wiser’s Legacy. Sweet woody oak and dry rye spice. Thankfully I got this as a sample with another purchase and didn’t waste my money on a bottle. $50 in Ontario.

3.0,"3 1/2 stars. Sweeter and a little more overpowering than it's square-bottled Wiser's brethren. Good but I prefer the 35yo, Legacy or Last Barrels."

3.5,Vanilla caramel delicious drink sips well above it’s price.
2.75,"before opening, looks really light. has a strong ethanol aroma. little spicy. not picking up on much complexity honestly, still getting quite a bit of ethanol/alcohol smells and tastes. kinda sweet. kinda bitter like i'd expect nutshells or rancid oil from a nut would taste like haha. after letting it air and chill for a second ethanoly smell and taste turns a bit more on the maple syrup side. however, something is not totally appetizing about this whiskey - not totally bad either. i'd drink it if someone offered"
3.0,Spicy with a little toffee and caramel in there.

3.5,"Sweet caramel, brown sugar, spice, and fruit."
4.25,Smooth light buttery first taste with a little smoky after finish. Surprisingly soft with not a lot of heat.
5.0,"Nose weaker than the typical Wisers, but it still carries the strong pleasant caramel and spice that defines wiser whiskey."
