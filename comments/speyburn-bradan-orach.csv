2.0,"An acidic taste which disrupts the flavour of this. There's hints of a good smooth flavour hidden away but that's all they are, hints. The flavours don't dominate, instead it's the the strong acidic tart taste that leaves you wanting a smoother drink. a reasonable price for it but I can think of nicer even at this price range, such as glen grant or miltonduff"
2.0,"The nose is dominated by green apples, with the addition of a little pear and some fresh grassy notes. Light honeyed undertone. Palate is a bit thin and reminds me of apple juice. The slightly bitter finish is short, acidic, and grassy."

3.0,A spicy start breaks away with a sweet flavor that is hard to distinguish it's origin. Towards the end of the whiskey you get a heavy malted flavor. This is an okay whiskey but I think deserves a little more than what Distiller granted it.
3.0,"Sweet from the beginning, honey and vanilla are full throughout. Not very smokey or salty. A bit tart at the end. This would be better with a thick peat or maybe some smoke with less sweetness. Ryan is right - malty at the end. I like that."

2.0,Grassy and acidic. Not very smooth. You don't always get what you pay for in single malts but in this case it was spot on. At ~$25 it tasted that cheap. Adding water or ice will dull the flavor even more but it helps dramatically to reduce the acidity or bite and makes it a smoother drink overall.

4.0,"I believe there is a time and a place for all whiskeys.  This speyburn tastes best right after a long days work.  It doesn't offer up the most complex palette of flavors, but rather calmly disapates floral and malt notes as you unwind from your day.  There is no need to add ice or water as there is almost no heat. What I love most about this whiskey is it doesn't demand attention, it takes a back seat and likes being there."

2.0,Mild and sweet. Not much going on here. There is a little acidity happening. An OK glass on the rocks if you're not paying attention but I think there's better at this price or not much more.

null,"Nose has a light peatiness, with overwhelming alcohol smell. The palate 60% alcohol bite, 30% honey, 10% citrus. This one belongs on the rocks."

1.0,Nose is slightly peaty unappealing lacquer thinner. Palate is a little better with an initial soap flavor that fades out leaving a peppery alcohol finish. Water helps the taste but it is extremely hard to get past the odor. Maybe drinking it through a straw.....

3.0,"Malty on the nose, sweet on the pallet. Great mouthfeel. Don't know if I would go out of my way to get it again though."
2.0,"Fruity with less bite than a typical Highland.  More of a dessert whiskey.  Not as tasty as the Speyburn 10yr, but has some pleasant notes.  The price of $25 is the major selling point of this bottle.  It has a quality that creeps over the course of a glass and becomes more pleasant.  The finish of honey and sweetness isn't bad.  It makes me wish for a better bottle, however it will be good in my flask for a warm up on fall nights."

1.0,Not all that great. Primary reason for buying a $25 single malt is because I plan on smuggling it on a cruise in a listerene bottle. I didn't want to risk having a nice scotch confiscated if I get busted. I will take my cheap scotch over paying for $10 beers.

3.0,"7/21/16 - Speyside sample from Scotch Whisky Experience. 
This is perfect for Rosh Hashanah. Apples and honey on the nose. Taste is honey, not much else."
3.0,Speyside sample at the Scotch Whisky Experience. Perfect for Rosh HaShanah. Apple in the nose and lots of honey on the finish.

3.5,"Nice affordable NAS single malt that displays notes of honeyed malt, biscuit, a little floral spice and a smooth delivery.  Not complex, but very good for the price point."
3.5,Smooth. Vanilla. Sweet Wheat.
2.75,A good entry level scotch.  Very light and approachable.
3.0,Nice but a tad weak. I think my palate has changed since I liked these light whiskies when I first started this wonderful journey.

1.5,"There's a reason so much of this distillery's production goes into blends: they need to because it's almost unpalatable on its own. The Bradan Orach is a very unrefined, bitter, tannic mess of hot alcohol, pungent spice, harsh ethanol, with a long, jellyfish tentacle, sting at the end. Even at the lower price, this isn't a very good sipper on the rocks. Tasted neat, it's like some sort of punishment. 

Hard pass on this."

2.0,"Nose: bright, almost zesty, light sweet crisp fruit notes with a moderate malt that settles into some slight vanilla and fresh cut straw, spring/summer like. Taste: fruit forward with a hint of honey, light almost white peppery note with a bit of an odd finish that’s slightly bitter. Nothing outstanding, but for the price it’s not a bad budget friendly option to rotate into the cabinet once in awhile. I can see why this should be part of a blend to help elevate it."

2.0,Almost a reddish amber color which is inconsistent throughout the glass. One side is paler than the other.  Very antiseptic nose. Maybe a peak of vanilla smell trying to break out of the antiseptic. Stingy on the tongue. Mostly towards the back. A bit of almond taste. Harsh afterburn and lips and tongue starting to tingle. Definitely not one of my favorite scotches.

2.5,"Sugary vanilla bourbon notes on the nose. A little bit of lemon zest flying in and out through your nose just to tell you I am here.
All the lovely notes above goes in and you actually would expect the same thing as you take a sip. However, there is a strong lignins, tannins and some spices come into play which eventually over power the whole thing. But to be honest it is not a bad thing as it's not boring.
For its price I would say this can be one of my daily cheap drinks including The famous grouse and monkey shoulder..etc"

2.0,"Mostly apple, some citrus, very bright and sharp, reminded me of a Chardonnay.   Good price for a single malt.  The 10 year is better"
3.0,"Saw this on sale for $19. I had the 10 year and liked it so gave this a shot. Neat, ok legs and glass coat. Nose is lemon drops and honey with rich malt. Palate has thick malt, more honey and light candied fruit. Finish is fairly long with tasty malt drying slowly to oak. This is more refined and has more body than the 10 year. I am extremely impressed with the quality and flavor here. Very smooth and drinkable with little heat yet still robust maltiness. For under $20 this is a slam dunk. Will absolutely purchase again 85/100......fantastic value imo        Update: latest bottle I purchased was not as good. Had some bitterness to the finish and lacked robust flavor as before. Still good for money but gotta lower score 80/100"

2.75,"Apples, floral notes and turpentine on the nose, sweet, smooth and oily on the palate, medium finish"
2.0,"Tasting this was exclusively the result of my mom asking for a ""good scotch"" for Christmas, which my brain automatically translated as ""the cheapest single malt I can get my Scroogie little hands on"". At $20 a bottle (which I patiently waited to go on sale to $18), this was easily the one.

I didn't really know what to expect going into this, but little did I know just how unusual it was going to be. The nose can be summarized like this: honey and...agave somehow. This feels like nosing a tequila, and I can't even begin to explain why. The bottle notes mention green apple and lemon, so maybe I'm misinterpreting that. Who knows? In any case, its youth makes itself known right away, with a bit of heat shoving its way through the initial flavors. Among these are the same honey-agave but with a slight herbal character, black tea with lemon, and unburnt tobacco. Medium-length finish, but heat is left on the tongue for quite some time, despite its low ABV.

I'm going to go out on a limb and say that there are probably better blends out there at this price. Other than some honey and weird-ass fruit, this is not a very good representation of a highland malt, or even a whisky for that matter. However, as the recipient proudly stated that she could indeed distinguish the taste of this from a bourbon, the guilt of not spending an extra $10 on the age statement seemed to just melt away. Maybe next time...or maybe Monkey Shoulder instead."
3.0,"Very light and simple and quite enjoyable example of a classic speyside single malt.
Light golden colour, rich creamy vanilla and fresh apples to the nose.
Same to the tongue. Again very light, sweet, a bit “watery” perhaps, almost without any of spiritous hints.
Finish is also sweet with fruity hints and oak on a palate; not very long yet satisfying.
These all make it a simple but still a gentle and a pleasant whisky - a one to drink from day to day but definitely not to keep it as a part of a solid collection. I may call it quite similar to the Glenlivet Founders Reserve."

3.75,"One of my favorite sub $30 bottles of anything. Sweet, somewhat floral, apples, pears. Does have a somewhat strong ethanol smell but does dissipate with rest. I know this has had low ratings but for me, it hits the spot for a cheap bottle."

3.0,"In spite of the slight harshness on the finish, you’d be hard pressed to find a better bottle of Scotch for $20. Vanilla and honey on the palette, with a lingering hint of leather and lavender on the finish."
