3.0,"Another sample dram from Miami Whiskey Mash.  This is the first Indian whiskey that I've tried, so check off another box on my spirits journey.  When I wandered over to the Paul John table, perhaps I'd had a few too many by that point, because I actually walked over to the wrong side of the display (i.e., the servers' side).  In fairness to myself, the tables abruptly flipped orientation when I went around the corner:  the tables on one side faced outward, while the tables on the next side of the rectangular formation faced inward for some reason!  After looking over the shoulder of someone pouring out drams, and beginning to think this was a self-serve station, it dawned on me that he was the server.  Awkward.  This peated whiskey reminds me of Port Charlotte or Ballechin more than the smoky Islay powerhouses like Laphroaig.  The peat was earthier, with significantly more minerality and loam, and even hints of mushroom."

#5: Paul John Peated Select Cask.  Single Malt Whisky from India.  55.5% ABV.  NAS.
Paid $84
Yes, I will be restocking this.

Wow!  I love Indian whisky!  It’s way more expressive and more reasonably priced than Japanese whisky.  This is a concentrated beast at 55.5% ABV; it’s made from imported peated Scottish barley, which is then distilled in Gao, India.  The nose makes false promises of being gentle.  There’s subdued smoke, and rich bourbon-influenced aromas.  Maybe it’s my imagination, but like the Amrut Fusion earlier in the countdown, I get a dank, humid whiff; like jungle perspiration and honey on linen.  The palate is a punch of flavors dialed to 11.  The peat is a lot stronger than the nose would lead you to believe.  But this is balanced by super dense barbeque sauce sweetness and bold spiciness.  It is so sweet, full-bodied, and bitey that I once mistook it for Octomore 7.2 in a blind tasting.  This is less than half the price of the Octomore, and I ended up rating it higher in that tasting.  The sweet, fruity boldness creates the illusion of wine cask influence, when there has been none.  I recommend some water added with this one.  It’s can sting otherwise.

5.0,Peaty with some sweetness from tropical Goa. Reminds me of having a barbecue on a hot summer day.

3.5,"A solid 3.5 star performer, it will do in a pinch and it’s enjoyable too, but not a rock star. Kind of one dimensional, a little figgy and sometimes too sweet. Still I’ll finish the bottle, since my brother left it here the other night."
2.0,It has potential but way too much peat and smokiness for my taste.  I couldn’t get past that to enjoy it.

3.0,"And now to number 5 on my Paul John flight. Started off middling score for brilliance, took a down turn for edited and classic and then up again for bold. This i like similarly to the bold but I think just didn't quite match up so 3 star it is. As an aside note straight after this whisky the founder/owner was very kind and pulled out a single sherry cask not for sale whisky 60%+ but very drinkable. Good all round tasting.  The bold definately wins the day for me"

4.0,"My last Drinks by the Dram sample.   I had always been curious of Paul John...it's raised in a hot climate like an Amrut, which expedites aging, but it's also by the ocean in Goa, unlike the Amrut which is  at a high elevation.   Just a bit of geography:  Amrut is made in Bangalore, which is incredibly hot and at an elevation of 3000 feet.  Goa is on the west coast of India, right at the beach, a tourist hippie  heaven.   Think Mazaltan, minus the drug cartels.  But that maritime location is gentle and hot, with warm tropical breezes instead of the salty briny tempest you'd get in Islay or Islands.  Ok...so...The nose is very minty, like smelling tic tacs almost.  Some eucalyptus as well.  Taste is much more earthy and grassy.  I love that the peat is really integrated into the taste, reminds me a lot of that recent Ledaig 18 I had last time.  It's there, and lets you know of the peat backbone, but it lets the wood shine first.  I love the way it goes from the eucalyptus aroma to the grassy earthy taste.  It's also potent, almost 55 ABV (angels share in Goa is to blame I guess).  What I don't like is the finish.  Has a bitter finish, almost like fenugreek.  It was doing so incredibly well until the finish.  Would I buy a full bottle?  Probably not.  It's good one time, but not sure I'd be coming back,just because of that fenugreek finish.  I'd be open to trying other products of Paul John though."

5.0,"During Warsaw Whisky and Friends festival I tried all the Paul John products and I find this one and ""bold"" most intriguing. If you are looking for a very good peated whisky this is your choice. There is a lot of classic earthy notes, but still this is kind of fresh and very well balanced - peat is great, but it does not overcome the other tastes - sweet, spices and fruits. I really enjoyed this and truly wonder what will happen when this stuff gest some serious aging. (130PLN - promo)."

4.0,"There is a beautiful copper color with in this whiskey, and thin oily legs cling to the glass.

The nose is strong and delicious with notes of peat, sea brine, floral honey, lemon, incense smoke, and burnt rubber.

The palate is equally delicious with notes of peat, BBQ char, rubber, sweet apple, French toast, and a medicinal quality.

The finish is long and transforms from bitter to sweet and dry.

This is a tasty dram! If I were to compare it to a scotch it’d be of the Campbeltown region. I find the generous proof and full flavor so good and I highly recommend it! Thanks, Paul John! Cheers!"

2.0,"Nose: way spicy, I can’t get any other nodes without it’s burning. Made my eyes water.

Taste: way too Smokey, very spicy, too much that I can’t taste anything else but smoke and burning. The taste is bitter and woody."
