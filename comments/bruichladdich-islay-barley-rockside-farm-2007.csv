5.0,"My first sniff threw me back to days making model cars in my childhood with my dad. The scent was reminiscent of that fresh coat of paint with out the assault of chemicals. But all memories aside it was immediately enjoyable as the first day of spring. I don't usually like fruity or sweet tasting whiskey but this one surprised me. It combined fruity tastes with just the right amount mellow. It loses nothing while not overpowering. I had it with one large cube of ice at the Vertical Wine bar in Pasadena, CA. I recommend it."

2.0,"A unpeated whiskey without a smokey taste.  It has a nice golden color, a overpowering nose that mellows with 2 drops of water."

3.0,"Not really unique save for the delightful finish that tastes like your sucking on a sweet plank of wood. The nose is salty, with hints of bacon, citrus, and a floral fragrance. The mouthfeel is full, zesty, lemon, and certainly malty. This is my third bottling of Bruichladdich that I have tried, including the Laddie and Port Charlotte. Sadly none of these have won me over."

2.0,"Nose: clean and bright, with a bit of a cooling sensation. Very light. Not much here... A hint of lemon soap. With a drop of water red apple peels
  

  Taste: really light citrus and malt. Doesnt linger at all. I assume they tried to keep the cask out of picture to show off the barley but it ends up kind of boring. Not kind of. Really flat. : /"

5.0,So delicately peaty (which is actually not a contradiction here). Unlike any other Islay whiskey I’ve had.

4.0,"Nose: Malt and cereals, some citrus notes, honeydew melon and a little barley sugar. There's a fresh seaside note to this, almost like gusts of blustery on-shore breeze. There's also some orchard fruit.

Palate: The arrival is crisply cereal and barley-sugar. As it develops the cereal foundation gains sweetness and almost honeyed notes. It's not a particularly complex palate, and completely devoid of smoke, but like the nose there is a fresh coastal aspect to it that is very appealing.

Finish: Medium. Fruity and yes - there's the barley sugar surfacing again before it finally fades away.

The lingering memory is of a very fresh but assured spirit-driven whisky. It's very tight and almost highly-strung when neat and a dash of water does it no harm at all, letting the nose bloom and hidden sweet floral flavours emerge.

This presents all the best characteristics of a youthful spirit without drawing undue attention to its lack of maturity. It would be a good malt to enjoy on a sunny spring day when there's a slight chill in the air.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

4.0,"This one is curled up tight like a hedgehog until you add a good bit of water but then it reveals an incredible vanilla custard crumble followed by a dollop of heat. Quite unique, a natural and somehow sophisticated taste compared to smoke and sherry bombs"

3.0,"Islay
Nose: strong meat overtones with an under layer of peat
Pallet: sharp peat with sweet fullness and a bit of oil."
4.0,"Smooth for 50 abv. Definitely reminds me of honey nut cherrios breakfast with a little smoke and lemon very tastey bought a 200ml for $29 cad """
4.25,"Initially put off, by a touch of funk in the nose and an oiliness to the mouth feel, but by midway through the bottle my taste buds are on board. Slightly medicinal aftertaste and yet still rich and buttery, like gold melted and run through a sieve and then carefully distilled into the most unusual Islay I have had the pleasure to enjoy. It is never my first choice, but with every dram I like it more."

4.0,"My initial impression was not to my taste. Then I added a little water and I realized the complexity and appreciated the difference between my usual choice of a speyside dram. Earthy, farmy and ascerbic but in a good way. I will not be embracing a Laphroaig any time soon. But this is a great between dram."

4.25,"Someday I'll figure out the difference b/n smoky and peatey - this is pretty bold and apparently the correct flavor is smoky. :)  Mildly sweet, but I had to read that before picking it out.  All in all this is exactly what I think of when I hear ""Scotch."""

4.25,"Sweet. Islay but without the peat allows some other flavors to shine. Sweet. The 50% ABV leaves a kick. Sweet. Vanilla and honey throughout, but vanilla forward and honey later being the development. Sweet. Some fruit and floral. Oh, and did I mention it's sweet? Grainy/cereal sweet."
4.0,Fruity and sweet.
4.25,"Complex, well-rounded, and balanced. Covers the full gamut of scotch in one bottle. Very good dram and worth the price of a $15-20 pour."
