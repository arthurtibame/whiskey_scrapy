3.5,"Light aroma; can’t really smell the smoke. Mildly smokey flavor. Sweet toasted caramel. Aftertaste lingers and is really nice. Easy middle of the road drinking, probably a good mixer."

4.0,100% barley malt smoked with hickory wood. A darker copper color with a smokey barbeque sauce taste. A great tasting American single malt.
