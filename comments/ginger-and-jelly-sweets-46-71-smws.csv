Very smooth and surprisingly mild for a cask strength - you can barely feel it’s 52.9%.

This distillery’s output is apparently mostly used in blends (Haig and JW), which does seem a shame for such a smooth dram.

A fresh spicy ginger taste upfront, moderately sweet but mainly spicy.  The finish has some citrus, more of the ginger and oak with a long finish descending into pepper, ginger and chilli."
