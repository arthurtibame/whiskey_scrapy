3.75,Pleasant dried fruits (more apricot) and subtle tone of dark chocolate on the nose. Mellow smooth fruit cake palate. Only thing which let this dram down was a near non-existent finish.
3.75,"This dram was number 2 on my flight of whiskies at the distillery with the founder David. He started laying down casks 18 years ago, starting with 50 litre, and then 100 and now the std 200 size unchanged from the Jack Daniels distillery where currently sourced. Initially they went a third each way with Heaven Hill, Woodfords and JD but now I believe they stick with the later. This dram they finish in French oak for several months (from memory). I really liked this dram, the french oak adding additional richness and spiciness, caramel come through and the green apple fades away. He mentioned that other than this one they are Ex-bourbon / american oak casking all the way and don't do sherry etc finishing.  Would be interesting to see them try though."
