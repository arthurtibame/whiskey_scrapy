4.0,"I had a 1oz pour of this at a family members house during Easter dinner. The odd shaped glass I used really pushed the alcohol scent right into my nose, and it burnt a little. After my first sip I moved the glass and the scent was much more of a traditional bourbon smell. The taste was a little sweeter than the four grain bourbon, even though this was a higher proof. I believe that the corn heavy mash contributed to the sweeter taste. I would definitely like to have another taste of this the next time I am around that house."
