4.25,"Color: Honey Golden Brown
Nose: Creme Brûlée with a sprig of mint
Palate: Delicious. Apple pie a la mode flambé.
Finish: Medium, sweet, and spicy
Balance: More sweet than spicy but wonderfully so.

Overall: One of my favorite Ryes in the world. Sweet baked honey apples with cinnamon. Caramel coating with vanilla and a hint of mint. The proof provides warmth without burning the palate. Definitely worth the price I paid."
3.25,"Flavors are pleasant but subtle. More vanilla than is typical for a rye. Tasty rye,  but doesn’t match its price point."

4.75,"The group insists that you not go after the bottle that's just laying on the ground surrounded by zombies a few blocks back, but that's because the group hasn't tasted this. Load up on ammo, and go back. This cannot be left behind.

Smells and tastes like drinking lemonade on a summer day in the wood shop with your grandfather. A-mazing."

4.0,Great but I wonder if its worth the price
4.5,"Tonight I had the privilege of sampling Wild Turkeys first Rye offering as part of their Master's Keep collection. For background this is the creme de la creme annual Wild Turkey release. Each year they do something a little different (last year's was an Oloroso finished Bourbon). I am a huge fan of the Russell's Reserve Single Barrel Rye so really wanted to try this one. Let's get some details on this release:

1) It's age stated at 9 years old (9-11 yr old barrels used)
2) It's bottled at 54.5% abv (cask strength)
3) Mashbill is 52% Rye, 36% corn and 12% malted barley
4) It's non chill filtered

Let's dive into the tasting:

Upon entry it's rich and oily. Very dense with dark fruits and burnt brown sugar. Toffee and oak follow with an array of baking spices. The mid palette adds cocoa, butterscotch and more oak. The finish is endless with pepper, clove, oak and toasted oak. The pepper and oak spice linger for a loonnnngggg time. 
Fantastic effort. Price aside, it's a world class Rye. However, it is hard to ignore $170 for a Rye. I'll knock 0.5 points for value. For any Rye purists this is as close as you will get to Nirvana. If you can afford it, buy it. Cheers all!"

5.0,"Happy that I finally found and purchased a bottle of this exquisite whiskey, and at MSRP. 

Phenomenal nose of bold baking spices, vanilla, pepper, oak and of course rye.

On the palate, the above mentioned explodes in your mouth. All notes are in balance and in rich, viscous harmony with an incredibly long finish.

This is a fantastic whiskey to be enjoyed and savored everyday. After all, we should celebrate each day. Cheers!"
4.25,"Just picked this up. I have been anticipating it’s release for several months. When I saw it on the shelf today I started shaking. I haven’t felt this way since the time I first laid eyes on Pappy Rye or the time I found out the Mcribb was coming back! Don’t judge. 

I’m going to eat a box of saltines to clean my pallet followed by an hour of meditation before I put on my finest drinking jacket, turn on George Thurgood’s “ I drink alone”, and engage in this affair called Cornerstone Rye. 

Wish me well y’all."
4.75,"Oh man. The vanilla and spices come across to me as almost like a little bit of cake or like a very classy honey bun. That pepper still comes through and lends itself into the other spices. I didn't get the apple notes until I let it sit out a little more. For the higher proof it drinks amazingly easy as well. The extra age in the barrel does show in the oak flavors. 

I might try to find another bottle to have on hand after this one."
5.0,"It's in the same class as THH.  Like THH, it's a ""barely legal"" rye, but the WT has a much sweeter profile.  Took a good 15 minutes to open up.  Nose is very pleasant, but nothing exceptional.   The mouthfeel and finish are top of the heap.  Has a dry cocoa/ chocolate/oaky thing going on and it's balance is spot on.  Delicious and one of the best ryes available."
4.25,"N - Dark brown sugar, slight hint of spice

P - Apple, baking spice, mellow and sweet

F - Smooth and sweet, easy to drink neat. The Apple finish is definitely there. 

It’s quite good, probably my top 3 rye but doesn’t hold a candle to Booker’s Rye in my opinion. Worth the shot if you can try it"
4.75,"Picked up a bottle of this in Amarillo on our way home from vacation in Colorado. I'm more a fan of KY-style ryes than the MGP 95% (can't stand that MGP dill flavor), with RR SiB and WFE 4-year being two of my favorites. I've also been a big fan of the last couple of Master's Keep releases, so when this Cornerstone Rye was announced I knew it was something I wanted to try.

Nose - baked apples, oak, leather, a hint of butterscotch, and some of that earthy WT funk. Greener notes of rye spice are lurking underneath, but they're subtle. No noticeable heat/ethanol on the nose. 

Palate - Rich mouthfeel with toffee and baking spices up front, then it transitions into mint, buttered rye toast, and some faint pepper and oak on the long finish. The rye flavors are stronger that I would have expected given the nose. 

All in all I'd say it's an excellent rye. It has bolder rye flavors than I expected from a ""barely legal"" rye, and plenty of depth and complexity from the extra aging. It's hands-down better than the standard RR SiB rye IMHO. Whether it's worth 3x the price is a slightly tougher call. The $129 price point of previous MK releases would have been more appropriate to me, but I guess it's just the reality of the current market that prices keep escalating.

Bottom line, if you're a fan of rich, well-aged ryes, or just older/premium WT expressions in general, this should be right up your alley."

4.75,"Tasting:  2oz neat in glen cairn

Nose:  (4.75)  Ripe berries, marzipan, oak, honey, and fresh churned butter. I also get nutmeg and all-spice.  For 109 proof not much ethanol on the nose.

Palate: (4.75):  Reminds me of Christmas.  Those tastes you get from sampling cookies right out of the oven.    Think toffee squares, fresh bourbon balls, the ones with the thumb prints and jelly in the middle.  Then comes the spices.  More nutmeg, a bit of clove on the back end.  This is really good.  Buttery rye bread rounds it all out.

Finish (5.0):  For days!  Oak, jam, a bit of mint, butterscotch with a puff of pepper on the back end.  It brings you back to start.

Overall:  A fantastic rye.  It is warm like an old friend.  It is sweet like a candy tray, but it has sass.  Definately a rye that tastes like a rye.  Strange how this was done with only a 52% rye mashbill.  I hate the price.  I think a lot of the Master's Keep Releases are about the neat packaging.  I could do without the box and focus on the juice if it were for a lesser price.  BUT you have to pay to play I guess.  I dont think much whiskey commands this price.  That saying THIS one will make me either buy a second reserve bottle or pine away when this one is done.  If not for price it is a 5/5 in my opinion."
4.25,Tasted this after Blantons Black. Obviously more spice and heat at the tail. Consistent taste through and through. No harsh finish.... just consistent. 107 proof keep in mind.
4.25,"More vanilla than what you typically find in a rye, but it still had that peppery finish you expect. Medium bodied, long finish, but not over oaked for something as old as this."

5.0,"One of the best Ryes I’ve ever tasted.
Balanced oak, spice with a long finish. 
Absolutely amazing. Also, I had this pour in a double blind whiskey tasting."
5.0,"Outstanding. Smooth, a hint of sweet, spicy, and a very nice oily texture that I love. Eddie did it again !!! Wow."
4.5,The long black pepper finish is one of the most unique things I’ve had in a rye in a bit.
5.0,"Neat.  Quite the nose.  It’s lighter and brighter than I expected.  Honey and apples are the first things I get.  Little citrus even.  Rye spice and slight hint of oak.  Lots of vanilla.  Hint of marshmallow. No dill, no black licorice.  As I hang out with it, the notes do balance out and get darker.  

Nice creamy mouth feel and palate is overwhelmed with flavor.  Powdered sugar, apple, cinnamon blasts on the tongue.  The swallow brings marshmallow, vanilla and rye spice.  The vanilla and rye spice remain on the legs with a little resurgence of the apple and citrus.  These flavors linger in such a satisfying way.

This whiskey is gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous.  Every sip thus far has given me pause and overwhelmed me with great flavor.  Bravo on this one."

4.5,Full flavor. Excellent.
3.0,"Fine, but nothing special and worth nowhere near the disappointing price tag."
3.5,"Quite a bit of ethanol on the nose.  Palate is bone dry, but classic rye flavors throughout."
3.75,Little bitter finish
4.0,Apple and spice nose followed by cinnamon. Getting a little smoke as well. Finish with that peppery rye taste. This is a good rye
3.75,"Takes an age and a drop of water to open up and reveal itself as a gently spicy rye with a soft creamy substrate. The nose crackles to a metronomic tempo. It’s not my favorite rye by a long stretch — I prefer the MGP and Alberta profiles, and this year’s Michter’s 10 is a more complex take on a lower rye mash bill. But I’d happily drink it at someone else’s expense."
4.0,It's good not great. Thin and a bit hot for the proof. The RR rye is better in my opinion.

4.75,"Had the first pour a week ago. Now it is time to see how this bottle is. 

Nose: This is deep and you can honestly get lost in trying to pull out all the nuances. Vanilla, caramel come out first but dark cherries, tobacco, spearmint, and dark crusty bread lie underneath.

Palate: A blast of leather, cherries, and oak punch first. Some dark chocolate, pipe tobacco, vanilla and baking spices are worming their way as you chew on this hefty pour.

Finish: this pour just keeps kicking - cinnamon, oak, more cherries, just keep hitting. 

A viscous, chewy, dark, and deep whiskey that begs you to come back.

Worth every penny."

3.75,"Light nose, faint funk, opens up with time. I also get berries, some honey. It's light, but there's a lot there. On the palate, rich. Robust, depth, and strong spice. Seems layered, complex. Finish has a strange note to it, not necessarily bad, but unique. Finish is long, changes. This requires attention and thought.  I think the price will throw people off, but this is good. 11/8/19"
4.25,"Nose has apple, vanilla, spice, and leather.

4.25,Cocoa. Oak. Rye. Sweetness. Overall very well balanced. Great mouthfeel. It is not very complex or unique though. I'm enjoying this bottle but for the price I won't be seeking out another.
4.75,"Solid 93-94/100 for me, and that could increase as the bottle has a chance to open up. Beautifully rich and textured, with a subtle spice over top the creamy oaky vanilla. Delicious"

4.5,"Wow! I was able to sample this tonight and was very impressed. A great nose with sweet vanilla and baking spices. The palate was just as impressive with more vanilla, spicy rye notes, and a surprisingly smooth finish."
3.75,"One of the best Rye's I've ever had. Very smooth but yet with a hint of honey and oak.
I'm a fan of this WT but its slightly overpriced"
4.75,New top American whisky in my collection...on par with BTAC pours that I’ve had. Phenomenal
4.0,"Nose: initial ethanol gives way to faint spice and vanilla
Palate: creamy, spice, oak, leather, light vanilla
Finish: dry, pepper, leather, light burn

I really didn’t like the initial nose and turned me off of the first few sips but after a few more it really grew on me and opened up as it warmed."

4.75,"This stuff is devine.
Age: 9-11 years 
Nose: cherry cough drops, caramel, vanilla, baking spices. 
Palate: SO viscous and syrupy. The cherry menthol tickles the front of the tongue, and is washed away by the spice creating an amazing hug. Clings to every part of the mouth. Glorious. 
Finish: perhaps the best finish I've ever had on a rye. It goes and goes...still going. Lingers as long as an islay, but it's sweet and spicy instead of ash.
In the end, this is a banger imo. I've enjoyed 4 pours of it since I bought it a few months ago. Some folks say that they can't tell it's a WT product...I think if you're into Turkey, you can tell...the cherry spice gives it away. Great stuff. Ready for RB rye!"
4.25,"Almond, anise seed and rye on the nose followed by orange zest and a pleasant peppery taste which starts early and lasts long into the finish. A very solid rye with a nice warmth from the back of the throat that lingers as it travels downward!"

P - good mouthfeel, slightly oily to slightly drying as it goes down, more apple, Orange, baking spice

F - moderate finish, nice toasted spice, touch of oak.  Only thing keeping overall score from being higher was the finish is on the shorter side given what I would expect from a high end Rye, and one with this proof."

4.5,"Love the spice.  The 109 proof makes it a little strong.  The taste of rye, vanilla and spice makes this a great bourbon.  The smell is awesome.  The spice and sweet settle and linger making this an enjoyable bourbon to sip.  Adding ice or a drop of water brings out the vanilla and spice."

4.25,"It has a rich vanilla and apples and spice on the nose.  It's like apple pie a la mode.

The palate has a sharp spice note with subdued apples and cream.  It has a very long finish with wood, vanilla, char, and mild spice.  It tastes like a mellower and more sophisticated Russell's Reserve rye, which isn't surprising given it's heritage, but considering that it's at a much higher price point, I'd probably take a few bottles of Russell's Reserve Rye single barrel over this instead.

Let me say, unequivocally, this is really good, but given that WT already makes a great rye at less than half the price, this one has big shoes to fill."
