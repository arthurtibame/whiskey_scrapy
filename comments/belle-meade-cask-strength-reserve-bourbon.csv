4.0,Full bodied. Very strong on the nose. Mahogany in color. Hints of citrus on the palate. Slight creamy mouth feel. Exceptional flavor.
5.0,A little hot after taste. Charcoal and wood. Tasty. Bought this at the distillery.
3.75,Get Spearmint on this one and it's the primary taste for me. Definitely a step up from the normal Belle Meade. Overall pretty smooth at the 112 proof.

4.25,"The juicy herbal flavor with licorice is really nice actually. The sweetness sis smooth and balanced with a nice toffee and juicy, fruity, licorice element. It kind of pops and although there is plenty of spice, that part still comes through. This tastes a bit more sophisticated than Booker's, with the rawness reduced. Either the blending of barrels or the additional age shows itself in giving this such a rich roundness. This is really a superb drink that takes some time to appreciate. The wood is there, some coffee and tobacco are there, spices come in. It's all there, but it's rich, delicious, and complex. The tannins are a bit harsh but relatively few, causing an eventual aggressive numbing, but this is still a really good drink. At the moment, although this has substantial vanilla, it has less than Booker's Shiny Barrel, but it also has less aggressiveness. This is a more mature drink to be sure, but it does take some effort to observe the flavors. The two are quite comparable in quality (both being very good), but their styles are different.
In direct comparison with Booker's Kitchen Table, this is clearly better. It's smoother with more fullness and richness and a nicer balance. It certainly tatstes more aged. Booker's country ham is harsher, but has some nice flavors with a tad of complexity, so it is more comparable. It's fairly comparable to Booker's Shiny Barrel, but it's more balanced with a bit more richness. I would probabaly take this over any of the Booker's. It's very good. The balance seems better than that of McKenna 10, though the overall profile has less pizazz. I think I'd take this still."

3.75,"During trip to Nashville earlier this week, I took a trip to the a Belle Meade Distillery. One of the distillery exclusive products was this reserve Bourbon. The specific batch I purchased was batch 16. It was a blend of 7 Casks of high rye Bourbon sourced from MGP and bottled at cask strength. In this instance that was 115.4% proof. The Casks were  between 7 and 13 years old.
Upon entry you get classic Bourbon notes of toffee, brown sugar and candied walnuts. Mid pallette is all spice with cinnamon and rye spice the most dominant. The finish is long with oak and tobacco with a hint of old leather. It's also a very smooth pour that is more subtle than a full blown flavor bomb. Much like the Kings County, 1792 Full Proof and JD Barrel Proof I have recently tasted, this is very good, but a notch below the Kentucky big boys. If anything, my appreciation for Stagg, ECBP and Booker's grows as I sample their competition! If you are in the Nashville area, look this one up. For the price, it's a great deal. When you consider that it's closest comparison would be a well aged Smooth Ambler Old Scout (which nowadays goes for north of $100) which also uses cask strength MGP juice, this is a great value."

Taste: some cherry on early sips but less so later on, pine, a creamy sweetness, a little rye licorice, later sips found chocolate 
Finish: rye, nice amount of burn, kind of a fresh/cool feeling
After reading reviews: not a lot of reviews on my usual apps but the ones that are there note vanilla which I’m not getting - maybe the creamy sweetness, the molasses/fig note on the nose I can see - it’s a rich/darker sweetness"

Color wise this stuff is black coffee side by side with belle meade standard 90 proof bourbon. Neat, its stout, but not a choking bite stout, but stout like Guinness compared to corse light. 

With water or on the rocks, man it opens up like a nascar throttle. Flavors galore, chocolate super present, rich throughout all the way to the smooth finish. Just a damn excellent bottle of whiskey."

3.75,"Batch No. 5, 56.8% ABV
On the nose, you’re abruptly hit with overripe apples, banana peel, gingerbread, toasted walnuts, graham crackers, and intense vanilla; very little subtlety here. The palate is quite a bit more complex than the nose,  with stewed apples and cherries, honey, ginger, cloves, cardamom, peanut brittle, musty corn, vanilla, and a bit of dried, dead grass. The finish is straight vanilla extract, honey, and dried apples, with a bit of a waxy walnut note. Expect a nice warming Kentucky hug on this one. A bit heavy on the vanilla and overcooked fruit notes for my preference, but overall an interesting and tasty bourbon."

5.0,From the Clarksville Whiskey Club and Louisville Whiskey Club - Cherry and cream with a hint of orange complemented by a sweet caramel flavor.

Finish leaves a nice lingering of these flavors and the residual heat on the tongue. Overall, a good addition to my bourbon family."
3.75,Batch 5 bottled at 113.6. Almost a floral nose with a lot of spice and lemon peel on the palate. Heavy hitting spice finish. Adding a couple drops of water brings out a more pleasant honey smell but leaves an oaky palate with a long-hot finish that stays with you.

Complexity is great, I’m a fan."

Sweet caramel, vanilla, maple and brown sugar galore on the front of the palate with barrel spice, oak and red hots on the back. Really like how it starts sweet then slides to spicy. Oily and full bodied. Nice punch from the Cask Strength. 

Long lasting spicy finish with more brown sugar. Man that finish hangs around for a while! Almost like pop rocks.  

Solid MGP stuff that I will always have on hand if can be found. Definitely in my top 5. Cold weather, by the fire sipper for sure."

4.5,"125.8 proof. Great deep and complex cask strength juice here. Nice nose with banana bread, oak, vanilla, oak.... and yes, jet fuel.

Palate has notes of raisin, chocolate, oak, vanilla, cherry, leather and a punch of cinnamon spice, but oddly without the briny rye flavours.

Finish is disappointingly short and quite dry. Overall great bourbon.

Water brought out fruit and nuts, turned the banana bread into fruit cake/banana bread combo."
3.5,"A sample from dthom as part of the ""whiskey transfer program"".

Nose: Traditiona bourbon nose.  Vanilla, caramel, apple, pear, baking spices, very sweet with background oak and some ethanol punch from the high proof.  Smells really nice.  As it sits in the glass I start to get dried fruit like raisin and date with banana.

Flavor: Caramelized nuts, vanilla, dark sugars, banana, dried fruits, and a little bit of a floral note.

Finish: Whoa spicy!  Quite a bit of ethanol punch from the proof, barrel spice and baking spices galore!  A very drying toasty finish that offsets the sweetness nicely.  Cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg.  The rye spice hits hard and then fades fast for a medium length finish that goes back towards those banana bread notes.

Nothing super exciting here but it's a solid barrel strength bourbon.  I enjoyed it but maybe a little ""checks the box"" for the usual price point above $60.  A little more rye spice on the finish than I'd like.  Overall if this were $45 I'd say it'd be a better buy."

1.75,"Batch 17 56.75.  Full disclosure going in, I don't recall this being special or really anything to talk about, but reviews are done as I sample so let's see.  

Nose - First not was a bit of paint thinner.  There's a bit of nutty notes. OK now opening up and I'm getting a lot of vanilla.  Water gives me a lot more baking spices.  A bit more oak too.  I also get more caramel now and almost no vanilla.    

Taste - Nutty, bit of spice, oak.  This has a bit of a beam note, not MGP oddly enough (this is MGP juice unless I've lost my mind, but I believe Belle Meade has a proprietary mash blend with them).  With water I get a bit of cinnamon, maybe a baked apple (?).  I'm getting another spice, something in the clove world.  

This is a much more complex whisky than I remember.  It's much more on the spicy forward with a good amount of oak spice.  

Anyway, a nice bourbon, it's good, but it's nothing special.  I'd love to try some of the other batches as I'm sure there are some exceptional ones but this one is a nice bourbon, I'm glad to have it on my shelf, I might even buy another, but it's nothing special either.  

OK so 2 vs 1.75 is rough.  I want to give this a 2 but when I think of a 2.0 it has to be something that if priced well (cheap for me or whoever buys) I'd gladly get it.  This is more I might maybe grab another one but I'm not excited about it, it's just something different to have."
4.25,"Picked this up on a hunch. So glad I did. 120 proof and on so tasty. The nose is amzing. I get cinnamon, all spice, cherry, and orange. Taste is just as good. Nice heat and taste of red hots candy, cinnamon spice, apple, and oak. The Finnish is long lasting and really tingles the mouth. A splash of water opens this wonderful whiskey up to A whole nother level. Great stuff. One of my current favorites."

4.0,"I’ve had and enjoyed a bottle of their regular bourbon. Now onto the Cask Reserve...

The nose has oak, vanilla, maple syrup, baking spices and freshly baked bread.

The palate is semi-sweet and spicey (rye and cinnamon), with oak and a little leather.
Every now and then I get a hint of corn.

The finish has a nice lingering tingle on the back of the tongue along with flavors of baking spices, oak and cola to stay on your mind.

This is really good. I definitely prefer to their standard offering. The higher proof (117.4) brings out so much more flavors and less rye, which is a nice change. It reminds me of a baby Stagg Jr, but it’s just the right amount of heat that is not overbearing."

However, I found I really liked the basic BM sour mash better.  It seems that the added proof hides flavors rather than contributing to them.  I kept looking for the extra notes and tones but they never materialized.  At $63 and up, I suggest the lower proof version if you want more flavor.  Not at all bad, but I just expected a bit more."

Nose:  Surprisingly light on the nose for cask Strength. Vanilla and some dark fruit, with a herbal/grassy note in the back.

Palate:  spicy on first drink. Cinnamon spice, with some vanilla but drinks a bit hotter (and I enjoy barrel proof) than I prefer. With some water, sweetness of caramel and vanilla really amps up. Somehow seems more creamy with the water too. I dont normally add water, but I prefer this one with some water in it.

Finish:  medium with mostly cinnamon spice coming through. Lingers on the back of my throat and lips."

I enjoy this as a workhorse batch proof option. It has changed a lot as the bottle has gone down. It’s a little unbalanced with flavors and the nose is pretty hot but it is almost a 120 proof whiskey. It handles ice well which validates that I really enjoy the regular  90 proof Belle Meade quite well neat. 
This batch is a cherry bomb and gives a nice Indiana hug. There are glimpses of a salted caramel and pipe tobacco which I just love. I will say though that while I enjoy this offering, I would go single barrel MGP cask strength if given a chance as some have real magic in them.
