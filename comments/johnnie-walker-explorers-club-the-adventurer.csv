4.0,"The Adventurer is a very interesting whiskey Because for me it is the only one of JW that relates more to sugar cane than to honey. It is a very weak whiskey in terms of complexity, it is a hit or miss likening in this one. Drink it neat or with one or two. It is very cheap, and the color of the bottle tells us it is somehow related to the terrible Red, but I think it is how the red supposed to be in the first place. It is very easy on the palate, but at the end you understand you are not drinking a 18 years, because the alcohol taste comes strong.
Like the single malts, this Whiskey will be loved by some and hate by others, I am in the first group."
