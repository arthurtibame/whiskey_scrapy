1.0,"A great way to ruin a good Canadian whiskey. This is pretty terrible. I had hoped that this was possibly done the way peated Scotch is in that the grains are dried and flavored with the burning of peat, or in this case Texas mesquite. Instead, as soon as the bottle is opened your senses are assaulted with what smells like a charcoal barbeque. While there is nothing wrong with barbeque, this tastes like liquid smoke. They literally took their whiskey and added  a liquid smoke extract of sorts that just ruins this otherwise enjoyable blended Canadian whiskey. I wish I could have gotten a refund. Instead, I just dumped it out. If you want smoke and whiskey, I'd suggest Jura Superstition if you can find it, or anither lightly peated Scotch such as Bowmore or Highland Park 12."
5.0,"This is the type of whiskey for men who enjoy medium rare steaks, Saturday barbeques, and football! Sat out back with the old man last night and drank the whole bottle. Already bought 2 more."
1.0,"This is it. This is the bottle that is atonement for all of the wrongs I’ve done in this world both past, present, and future. Absolutely horrible whiskey, crown really fumbled the ball on this one, only 1 star because it isn’t possible to be a 0 star to my knowledge."
1.0,Absolutely Disgusting tastes like a camp fire.
2.75,"Not bad, another Crown Royal flavor that will pass by with out much fanfare. It's worth it if free or you get a good deal."
2.0,"smells like a bottle of BBQ sauce, but tastes more like mesquite wood chips than mesquite smoke, the finish is mighty bitter.  I love BBQ but this bottle is a failure."
4.0,I like the barbecue smoked taste to it
1.0,"if you like drinking wood chips, then this is for you!... this bottle was gifted to me, needless to say I don't like it neat, on the rocks, or with a chaser. However I used it as an ingredient in making a homemade BBQ sauce for some ribs and chicken."

1.0,I expected much more from Crown. This is the worst whiskey ever to cross my lips.

4.5,Classic crown with perfect balance of mesquite smoke and that classic crown royal sweetness. Coats the tongue like Barbecue sauce. Goes great with any barbecue  style food.
3.0,not a big fan but if you like the Smoky flavor it's really there really a sipper that's for sure.

1.0,"I’m out in Denver, staying at my regular hotel where the bartender knows me by now.  I stopped over to say ‘hello’ and saw this on the shelf.  I asked her to give me a pour, and she promptly replied “ you sure?  Okay...fine, but I won’t charge you for it...I need to keep you as a returning customer”.  That should’ve clued me in.   I’m a huge fan of Crown Royal Northern Harvest rye, as well as their Cornserstone one.  So, I was hoping for something similar.  I thought it’s like having a Lagavulin or Ardbeg...there’s no such thing as a bad Lagavulin, just not as good as the other Lagavulin but still damn good.  Not this.  Oh keep away from this one.  I took two sips and gave up.  It’s just lousy swill, half really bad tequila and the other half really bad bourbon.  @LeeEvolved and @Telex   I know you guys think I’m picky and harsh...but my 1 Star here is actually really generous.  Hell, even @Generously_Paul would give this 1 Star, and he’s normally forgiving.  Crown Royal:  maybe you can sell this to a pharma company to make into antiseptic wipes."
1.0,Probably the most offensive whisky I've ever tasted.

2.0,"Good for chicken and ribs...that's about it. The mesquite is overpowering, and the vanilla, cinnamon notes keep it a smooth drink. But I feel like I'm drinking a BBQ sauce not whiskey."

4.25,"Very smoky, best mixed."
2.5,"This stuff is completely dumb. Its the one note carmel/vanilla sweetness you expect from CR with some mesquite smoke that’s not very convincing. Its crap, but that doesn’t mean I don’t enjoy it. Im dumb."

2.0,"Tastes like someone dipped there smoked brisket on my crown Royal, but not in a good way... But at the same time, the flavor kind of grows on you. Good on a rare occasion."
null,Tastes like a tire fire.
0.25,"I had a buddy who bought this “because Texas.” In the immortal words of George W. Bush, “Mistakes were made.” This whiskey, if you can call it that, tastes like what would happen if you put the reject Food Lion version of BBQ Lay’s in a blender with some rubbing alcohol, cigarette butts and nacho cheese. It is bad."
3.75,"Taste from a fresh bottle: definite taste of wood
Taste from open bottle: much smoother"
2.5,Smooth. Good mesquite flavor. Still crown.
1.0,Tastes like a bisque of charcoal
1.0,This is probably the worst I have ever try. Smoke flavored like BBQ sauce. Once you try all that remains is that barbecue flavor.

1.0,"liquid smoke. Terrible to drink, might be good added to a pot of beans."
0.25,"Worst I’ve tried yet. Might try adding it to bbq sauce, but it might ruin the sauce."
0.0,"Nose is barbequed ribs, wet sauce, with a side of BBQ brisket. Taste is immediately vanilla and then BBQ sauce."
