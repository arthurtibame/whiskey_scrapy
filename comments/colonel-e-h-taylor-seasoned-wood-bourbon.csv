5.0,Lots of different flavors.  Has a smokey and dry fruit notes.  Palate was very good too.  Almost has the flavor of a very nice scotch minus the peat flavor.  The after taste has a slight root beer flavor in a good way(craft root beers).  Definitely a must buy.

4.0,"I sometimes wonder about write-ups like this.   This is the first whiskey I've ever had that upon first sipping smell & sipping had the distinct flavor of dark fruits.

Plum wine... Pomegranates resonate throughout.  Influencing the nose, palate and swallow.
Smooth throughout, it does benefit from a splash of water."

3.0,"The whiskey in this bottle is plain good.  The nose is fruit forward, with peaches and apricots standing out. You can tell this is a wheated bourbon. The palate is sweet and smooth, but a bit muted like it doesn't know exactly what it wants to be.  The finish has hints of cinnamon spice and is fairly short. This is a good pour and deserves a better rating."

5.0,"This review was transferred over from the Barreled App:


I stumbled across this gem at Monk's BBQ & Bourbon in northern VA yesterday and was extremely excited to get a taste.

This might've had the biggest, in your face wood profile I've ever tasted in any whiskey.  The initial burst was borderline overpowering on the tongue, but after a bit of a ""chew"" it really opened up- big oak char finishing with a punch from the rye.  It finished hard as I suspect it should.  It's not something I'd want to drink often, but I'm incredibly happy I got to try it once.  Good good stuff.  Cheers."

4.25,Sweet dark cherry nose. Wood and vanilla flavor profile with touches of fruit and chocolate. Semi-oily/fluffy mouthfeel with a slight bitterness on the aftertaste.

4.25,"The nose has molasses, caramel, vanilla, oak and a slight astringent spiciness that all balances each other quite well. Sweet and creamy notes of molasses, vanilla, and butterscotch follow with subtle baking spices. The finish is medium to long with fading butterscotch and vanilla, with cinnamon in the background."

4.25,Great pour at a friend’s house. Had that great buffalo trace fruit note to it and wonderful amount of bite and flavor on the palate. Didn’t spend too much time dissecting it but it was really nice. Glad to have had the chance to enjoy it though I didn’t notice any obvious effects of the seasoned wood. Tasted like a solid 100 proof Weller pick or Old Rip frankly.

Taste is more sweetness vanilla, caramel, cherry toasty goodness and spice. Bad news cant find a bottle of this either......"
