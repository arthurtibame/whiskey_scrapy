1.5,"Dr. McGillicuddy’s tasting 2 of 3 for this evening. I’m pessimistic!

The nose: sweet baby Jesus. I’m not sure I can do this. It smells like a body wash. Shea butter maybe?

The body: I don’t hate it. The honey is unmistakable. But the whiskey underneath isn’t awful. I wish I could get past that honey to actually figure out that whiskey, but the honey is just too intense.

The finish: this one sort of has one. It’s more just the honey leaving a sickeningly sweet mouth feel for a few seconds after the flavors pass.

This is better than the last. I could see this as a medicinal dram if I had a cold or a sore throat. I think I’d really like it then. Also could be amazing in a hot toddy. Not to be enjoyed neat when you’re fully healthy."
