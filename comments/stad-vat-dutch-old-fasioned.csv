3.75,"The smell betrays the taste. You should not judge it on the smell. The taste is bit of vanilla, but also kinda spicy. An excellent piece of work from this young distillery. Truly looking forward to more."
3.0,When you open the bottle a strange but nice smell penetrates your nose. You don’t expect this taste after you smelled it at first but it is not bad. A fine whiskey from a young distiller! I look forward to see the older versions of this fine whiskey.
