4.25,"A slightly more subtle peat than some other Lagavulin. A faint chalky, stoney note up front with a little bit of toffee finish. An interesting variant"

4.25,"Classic Islay scotch!  Rich flavor. Lovely peat, sea salt, and dried fruits dance in a melodic symphony of flavors. A wonderful dram indeed!  Go buy one..."

4.0,"Same smoothness and timed complexity as the standard 16, but with a bit more tang and vanilla.

Likely due to the transferring to Pedro ximinez casks which equals double maturation.

Great amount of peat and smoke in the start, but soon reveals lots of scents once it makes it way down.

Definitely a favorite"
4.5,"In the nose smokey, peaty aromas with a hint of herbs, palatal flavors of caramel, peat and strawberries accompanied with a hint of basil."

3.5,"On the nose, the peat smoke punches through first but quickly recedes into pool of strawberry jam and blackberries which retains it's intensity due to the underlying peat base.
The taste retains the fruit notes with a syrupy consistently but the finish blossoms back into a flurry of peat smoke returning the dram to it's roots. It's a strange, peculiar experience, though one containing great delights if given sufficient attention."
4.75,"Incredible. Less peat, more ripe fruit."

4.5,"If you ever want to buy a good whisky, without having tried it before, to make a safe bet, you can always trust a Lagavulin Distiller's edition. This review is for the 2018 expression, distilled in 2002; as always 16yo, for a lagavulin classic age statement.

Bottled at 43%, amazing chesnut color. 

On the nose: LEMONADE. WOW. this is pure lemonade. With hints of heather, peat and maybe starfruit. 

On the palate, things happen one moment at a time: at first, notoriously sherried, then prunes, then pepper and peat.
Some Toffee and Salt. Very nice and complex.

Aftertaste is beautiful: Smoke, so fancy. Refined. Ashy, bonfire and Sulphur. Spent Fireworks, spent matches. Lovely, but mostly interesting.

Overall this is a great dram, as all Lagavulin Distiller's Editions....... as all lagavulins too. 92 over 100."
