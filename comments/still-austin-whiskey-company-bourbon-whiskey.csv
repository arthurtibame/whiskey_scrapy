2.25,"You really roll the dice with craft distillers. 

There’s a handful of craft places that have really nailed it (Balcones, Stranahans, Del Bac, Colkegan, etc.), bit for every one of those guys, there’s a startup distillery that wants to rush a product to market. That’s this pour. 

We’re very fortunate to have a number of local distilleries in Central Texas. Some are remarkable, but others are still struggling to find their footing. Still Austin has been selling their new make for a while now, and recently released their first four year old bourbon. I also tried a bourbon finished in PX casks that’s a distillery exclusive. They’re going in the right direction, but this juice needs more time in the cask. In a few more years it will likely be outstanding, but right now it just tastes young, hot, and not ready, even with aging in the Texas heat. Keep your eyes open for this in a few years. I did get a souvenir Glencairn for my troubles. Cheers!"

3.75,"Solid first release. Still a bit young (its a year old after all) but I has none of the unpleasantness one would expect from such a young whiskey. Butter scotch on the nose and some nice baking spice. It's a bit thin and light, but probably a good transition whiskey for those looking to graduate from Crown or TX Blended to real whiskeys. I look forward to their future releases. I gave them a bit more of a bonus since this is their first release and they are a craft distillery actually making their whiskey. I hope they continue to get better."

3.25,Has that fresh cut grass/ pine smell from small distilleries but the taste is nice; young wood with cinnamon and brown sugar and a little vanilla
