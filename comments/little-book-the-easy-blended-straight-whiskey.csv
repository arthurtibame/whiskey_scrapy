Ice to open all the favors. It is a really good whiskey a little over priced just like Booker’s is now."

3.0,"Release 001. Salted butter on the nose. The proof is evident on the nose. Hot on the tongue, through the finish. Sweet, wood, astringent cherry, if that makes sense. Cough drops. Nutty on the backend... walnuts, a hint of peanuts, and bitter pecan shells. Cherry and nuts, a familiar Beam profile. 10/26/17
Still get salted butter on the nose. Some vanilla, yeasty bread, and sour fruit. Lots of alcohol heat, singed my nose hairs. Hot on the tongue, I'm getting bitter cherry and fake sugar, like a cough drop. Lots of pepper and spice, and bitter pecan shells. Warmth lingers in the chest. There's an odd flavor here that I can't place. The bitterness lingers. 9/14/18"

5.0,"Wonderful Whiskey! As with most, I was very skeptical at first. However, after it was on the Whiskey Advocate Top 20 I decided to take the plunge. Purchased for $79.99. In my opinion that is a very fair price. Its sweet upfront but not overbearing. It's tastes like cornbread. Then we move to a nutty flavor with a hint of sweet oak. Finally a lovely long spice finish. It's incredibly smooth for the proof. I have no doubt this.will become a collectors item! If you see it for $100 or less it's an instant buy."

3.0,"This is a good advertisement for corn whiskey, even though it is only a part of this blend. 

A straightforward nose of corn meal, pickling spices, dried cherries, and toasty rye grain. Though this is steeped in ethanol fumes.

This has a lengthy and smooth palate after taking a step back. Initially sweet caramel and bitter tannins. This leads to a broad mid-palate consisting of cornmeal, dry bread, and fresh wood flavors.
The tannins return with the traditional Booker explosion of wood spices. The healthy proof creates an after-burn that stays with you for quite some time.

It's whiskey like this that makes me want more corn whiskey. Sweetness in step with drier flavors. Why isn't there more corn whiskey?"

4.75,"I've had this bottle for a few weeks now and just been holding off on the ""notes"" as I wanted to wait for the perfect moment to sit down and enjoy doing the taste sample of it, uncompromised.   As noted elsewhere I picked this one up at the same price Bookers sells for in my woods (75$) and would consider that a bargain.  The nose stands out as pure and true bourbon at full strength, with just enough alcohol to make your nose hairs salute.  A thimble of water in the glencairn encourages it to break open a bit but the sweet, spice warmth does not yield.  The advertised chestnut and rye are perfectly balanced with a cinnamon carmalized candy corn and while it may not ""classify"" as bourbon on a technicality, at no time are we led to believe this hails from anywhere other than  straight from the old kentucky home.   On the tongue Little Book is a reminder that, as in all in life,  there is a ""right way"" for bourbon as well, the dark sweet sugars, the earthy woods, the spices are all right here, and 13 years of mellowing gives credence to the notion of why you can't hurry perfection.  The combined warmth, taste and smoothness all come together in Freddies concoction, as the familiar ""this is why we do it"" thought prys its way into your brain.   One side note, if you just opened the bottle, give it some time to breath and you may avoid sweat pouring off your brow.    Whatever notes of cherries jubilee, blackberry jam or cinder soot you take away are yours to own but however you enjoy it, you will find something to take away, if you don't then clearly vodka(or turpentine) are your drink, and not bourbon whiskey. 
  
  The beauty of the sweet warmth that finishes with just mildy peppered cinnamon as it makes a completely smooth exit reassures that what you are enjoying is a ""work of art"".   Forget all the fancy silly bottles and slogans the latest fad marketers are throwing at you and remember there is no compromising the taste and with Little Book, you don't have to compromise. 
  
  A hearty well done to Freddie Little Book Noe."

4.0,"The Distiller review is right on with this one, as is the score. The contrast between this and the disappointing Gifted Horse is pretty striking, although ultimately I'm not 100% sold that this whiskey warrants its $80-90 price tag.  The nose is an intense blend of vanilla and well-aged oak, and those flavors also dominate the palate, which bursts with complex oak and cedar wood.  This feels like chewing on Werther's candies in a dusty, antique furniture store.  Additional complexity comes in with heavy wallops of rye and corn, and the palate has an extremely thick, oily mouthfeel.  I would not have guessed that there are components in this blend that are 4 to 6 years old, so that's a testament to the work done by the young Noe."

4.0,This one is rich and potent! The nose and palate are full of cherry pie filling and a good dose of orange bitters. Spices like cinnamon and clove follow suit along with some vanilla. It gives the impression of a wine influence with how it coats your mouth with a dark fruits sweetness and acidity. All that water did was bring out some waxiness on the long finish. This one lasted me awhile as I could still taste it in-between sips. A little goes a long way here.

4.0,"I'm a huge fan of Booker's Small Batch and the Small Batch Series; and while Little Book is a blend and a totally different animal, I've been eagerly looking forward to tasting it.  The concept of constructing a blend that (mostly) mirrors the composition of a traditional mashbill is a clever approach.  Does it work?  I have no idea, but I'm about to find out.  The reviews for Little Book ""The Easy"" are all over the map.  Some love it, some don't, and that's to be expected.  I commend Freddie Noe for taking the road less traveled and offering the whiskey world something different, something that challenges the status quo.  Purchased for $75 at my local B&M.  Now on the to review.
    
    Nose: Musty Oak, Brown Sugar, Sweet Corn, Vanilla, Light Smoke, Cherry Jam, Buttered Toast, Hazelnut. 
    
    Palate: Roasted Nuts, Caramel, Corn Grain, Smoky Oak, Rye Spice and Vanilla. 
    
    Finish: Smoky Oak, Cherry Cola, Buttery Caramel, Rye Spice, Clove, Vanilla and Roasted Nuts.  
    
    The initial nosing of the whiskey offers aromas of musty oak and brown sugar with a subtle presence of sweet corn and vanilla.  Considering the high alcohol content (64.1% ABV) I'm struck by how easy this whiskey is on the nose.  I would have expected a strong element of ethanol, but it's actually quite mild for cask strength.  As I give the juice a gentle swirl, the legs are long, of medium thickness, and they cascade slowly down the interior of the glass.  After 15 minutes I'm picking up some light smoke, cherry jam and a hint of buttered toast.  At 20 minutes in the glass the vanilla grows stronger and at 25 minutes I'm also smelling some hazelnuts.  So far I'm really diggin' it.  On the palate at full strength the whiskey has a rich, oily mouthfeel with flavors of roasted nuts, smoky oak, corn grain, caramel and vanilla.  It's not as sweet as the nose suggests and is well balanced.  A strong bloom of rye spice and familiar Booker's heat follows that is very rounded with no sharp edges.  A larger sip yields much more heat and a noticeable amount of burn all around the tongue.  However, for those who enjoy cask strength whiskey this is a good burn, full of flavor.  It definitely puts a smile on my face.  The finish delivers a healthy dose of smoky oak along with buttery caramel, roasted nuts, rye spice, cherry cola, clove, vanilla.  A little water brings out some caramel on the nose along with more sweet corn.  On the palate I get more grain and corn sweetness, more cherry and dark fruit, and less rye spice.  The water extends the length of the finish, but the flavors are less defined.  Being the first pour from a newly opened bottle I expect some things to change.  However, upon first impression I think I prefer ""The Easy"" without water.  Overall, it's a great release.  Freddie has done an excellent job with this blend and I enthusiastically give him two thumbs up.  In terms of a star rating ""The Easy"" gets a solid 4 out of 5, and I expect after the bottle has been open for a few weeks the whiskey will get even better."

A drop of water takes away the bite but doesn’t seem to do much for the mouthfeel. Getting some moldy wood (the good kind😁) and even some Fruit Stripes gum as it evaporates at the back of my tongue. This is a solid American Whiskey (not a Bourbon) because of the unique blend."

Wow. Wow. Wow. How can such a punchy dram be so beguiling? The nose is sweet and buttery, yet floral; the colour deep amber. The palate has vast alcoholic oomph delivered with a honeyed sweetness and finished with a sly spicy warmth. Ooh, and cinnamon peanut brittle somehow. 

Little Boom achieves balance by being perfectly weighted on every axis, and altogether huge and satisfying. I feel bolstered for my bike ride home in the snow. Thanks Bookers!"

It's always good to start with chapter one. This wiskey has an interesting nose. It's earthy, kind of like dry moss, and has a light touch of buttery walnuts.

This is a full figured whiskey with sharp edges and a soft center. It's good, simply good."

4.75,"I've been wanting to try this for a while and when I ran across a couple bottles of the 2017 I couldn't resist at $80.  Wow is this good!

Nose: Very complex.  There is a lot going on here probably because of the blend of three types of whiskey.  Leather, molasses, vanilla, lemon peel, cinnamon, cedar, green apple peels, dried cherry, and heavy ethanol punch given the high proof.  This keeps getting more interesting and deep the more I smell.

Flavor: Maple syrup right up front, cigar, leather, dried figs and dates.  Wow.  Punches way under its weight for the proof.  Very smooth and buttery.  

Finish:  Long finish with lingering wood notes, rye spice, baking spices.  Big Kentucky hug with lingering warmth and flavor.   Changes towards the end to peanut butter, nougat, and caramel.  Tasted a lot like a snickers bar as it lingered in my mouth.

Truly one of the best drams I've had. Outstanding with some of the Beam flavors I'd expect.  Cousins flavor wise to some of the Booker's that I've had but way more complex and interesting.  I may have to buy another bottle off the shelf.  Snag this if you can find it."
