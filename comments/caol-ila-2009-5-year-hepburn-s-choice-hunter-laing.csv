3.75,"This is the third review of a short line-up of 3 drams I tried at a local small 'independant bottlers & limited releases' event I was invited to.

I tried following fine drams (read their respective reviews elsewhere on this site):
- The Maltman (Secret Orkney Distillery) 2005 12 Year Old (Sherry Hogshead) 
- Hunter Laing's The Old Malt Cask Caol Ila 2009 (9 Year Old) Red Wine Finish 
- Hepburn's Choice Caol Ila 2009 5 Year Old (Quarter Cask) 

I didn't plan on trying the last one on the list, but while the host explained to another guest that this Quarter Cask Caol Ila was an exceptional dram for it's young age, he also poured me a small amount to nose it - and taste it, ofcourse! :).

For it's relative young age, it was indeed a excellent dram. 

Distilled in 2009 it got to mature for 5 years, including a finishing period in European Oak Quarter Casks. Only 98 bottles are available. Peculiar is though, that it must have been left untouched in storage for several years, considering it's age and year of distillation, and now it's release...

The color was less impressive that the darker appearances of the two other drams I had that day, but it nevertheless had a nice tanned color.

Beside obvious marine character, the nose revealed peat and smoke, on the palate assisted by some red fruits. The aftertaste was equally satisfying, but not very long.

I must admit that the order of the line-up wasn't ideal to evaluate this one, as I actually finished with the lightest taste-profile of the three. It probably would have come better to it's right if I had started with this one. After the robust roundness of the earlier two - excellent - drams, this 5 year old Caol Ila felt a bit subdued, a bit watery. For its age (and price) nevertheless a fabulous whisky."
