Tastes warm in the mouth, alcohol burn in the way.  Pleasant and easy to drink."

2.5,"Sitting here on a dreary Friday evening binge watching and trying to catch up on GOT.  What better way to enjoy this free time then to sip a scotch. A sample provided by @LeeEvolved that is a sherry finished NAS bottle #3 bottled at a fair 43% and bottled on 9/29/2018. 

Light amber in color with golden a hue. 

Sherry aromas are immediately apparent.  Slightly nutty of almonds and/or walnuts with the sweetness of dates.  Butterscotch, Demerara sugar, vanilla.  An artificial grape note is present, but faintly with orchard fruits.  A decent nose, soft, sweet and light. 

The palate is light and thin.  Initially sugary sweet but not overly so.   Butterscotch and vanilla cream. That sweetness turn quickly spicy and bitter.  Oaken spice, cracked black pepper, cloves and ginger provide the spice notes.  The bitterness begins at the fade towards the finish. 

The bitterness is slightly citric of lemons and oranges rinds.  It fades quickly to woody and tannic dryness which seems to last fairly long. 

A solid beginning which starts sweet and devolves to a spicy dryness.  It holds potential to be something better. This has been unleashed a few years too early.  Decent but it’s nothing I would actively seek out. [83/100][Tasted: 4/26/19]"
2.75,"Another Glenturret up to bat today thanks to @LeeEvolved and his never ending shipments of samples. This time the NAS Sherry version (batch #3). This one was bottled slightly stronger than the peated version I had earlier at 43% ABV. Like the last one I believe it to be chill filtered and natural color, this one being an amber gold. 

The nose opens with sweet and savory sherry. Raisins , brown sugar, toffee and caramel. Buttery and nutty - cashews and almonds. Light cinnamon and clove with some ginger and vanilla. Fruity with grapes, apples and pears, a touch of mint. There is also something of a lemon/orange mix. A pleasant nose that I found quite nice, but obviously on the young side. 

The arrival on the palate was a bit spicier than I had expected, but not hot in any way that resembles anything cask strength. Sherry, harsh oak and tannic. Buttery, nutty with some vanilla. Oaky bitterness, grapes and sour apples. Clove, allspice, nutmeg. The palate went from average to worse pretty fast. Maybe it’s just an off day for me, but I really did not enjoy the taste.  

A light to medium bodied mouthfeel that is slightly astringent and very dry. 
The finish is medium length with bitter oak and sherry, nutty, tannic and dry. 

While the nose was nice and by far the best aspect of this dram, the palate was unforgivably harsh and bitter. Another few years in the cask may be what this guy needs to come around, but sadly it’s doomed to a life of juvenile delinquency. I’d avoid this one unless it’s going over ice or in a cocktail, because it just can’t stand on its own. 2.75
Cheers"

3.5,"Lots of raisins and maraschino cherries on the nose, but I don’t get the sweetness on the palate. Like the peated version, the cask seems to be felt mostly on the nose. A likable dram, nevertheless."

3.0,"This was an affordable bottle I added to a recent international order.  This is from Highland distillery, Glenturret.  This is a new, NAS release that was finished in refilled sherry casks.  This is from Batch #3 and is bottled at 43% and cost me a cool $50usd.

It’s deep gold/Amber in color, oily with wide, watery legs and huge droplets in the Glencairn.  There’s no indication of chill filtration or color added, so I assume both are present here.

The nose is sherry grapes and butterscotch with faint vanilla notes in the background.  There’s absolutely no cask presence or signs of alcoholic bite.  The palate is sweet grapes, butter and sherry.  It’s slightly harsh with some weak vanilla and dry oak astringency.  The finish is on the short side with vanilla and light oak.  It’s very weak though.  The finish really hurt the overall experience.

Speaking of overall, it’s a serviceable dram that would work well in cocktails and even over a cube of ice.  It doesn’t need water.  I’m not sure it’s worth the price.  There are more easily accessible drams available at a similar, or lower, price.  2.5-2.75 stars.  Cheers."
