4.25,"A nicely complex but approachable bourbon. Being a heavy corn mix, it is sweet, but not overbearingly so. The flavor of “corn dust” as some people describe it, or that reminded me of the taste and scent of fresh popped popcorn is delightfully present. Peppery and vanilla notes throughout. A slight coffee note on the finish as well."

4.75,"Just wow! This bourbon has flavor - sweet pear, caramel, and molasses on the nose. The flavor is bold with red fruit, clove, cinnamon, and more pear - very thick mouth feel. This is what I expect out of a whiskey aged in Texas - big and bold. It is incredibly soft for something that is 115 proof - I get more burn from most 100 proof whiskeys. Definitely jumps this distillery to one of the best in the state."
3.5,"Caramel and vanilla on the nose, heavy alcoholic burn (to be expected at 115 proof). Wish it was a bit smoother to let the flavors come through the surface."
4.75,"Immediately hit with a big earthy note on the nose; damp earth, rich red fruit. Fades to classic bourbon vanilla and oak with a hint of earthy cabernet wine. The palate is rich and complex for bourbon. Fruity corn, buttered popcorn, caramel, baking spice, nicely integrated oak, red berries. A big hit of cocoa and dark chocolate. Buttered corn, white pepper and leather on the finish with a little ethanol heat. It’s a gorgeously big and rich bourbon with a lot to offer. Everything in balance and rounded for a high proof whiskey. Drinks well below the proof mark but there’s enough heat to let you know it’s not your standard 90 proofer. Texas is representing with a beautiful and unique bourbon offering. Well done Ironroot. Well done."
4.25,"I had tried the 90 proof version of this one a couple weeks back and really enjoyed. Originally I had not bought the cask strength version as all of the reviews I had read had stated that it was very had and needed a water and or ice to really tame it. I figured why pay the extra $ for the proof. However, when I reached out to the Distillery to get some information on these Bourbons they pointed out to me a number of interesting differences between the two. Firstly, the XC (90 proof version) is batched from a 35 barrel blend versus this is batched from a 10 barrel blend. The XC is a 70/30 split between Euro and American oak, this one is a 50/50 split. Finally the XC includes barrels aged between 24-30 months whereas this one is aged for an average of just over 3 years with the oldest barrel being 4 years old. So for the extra $15 you are getting a lot more than just the extra 25 proof points!
That was enough to convince that I needed to give this one a go! Specifics on my bottle. It's part of the 2018 batch and comes in at 115 proof. It comprises of 4 high corn mashbills (undisclosed) that include 4 varieties of corn (purple, red flint, bloody butcher and yellow) that are all locally sourced. On to the tasting:
Upon entry it's so soft and silky. Caramel and buttered corn bread to go with a lovely spice undertone. As we move to the mid pallette the red fruit and grapey notes become pronounced. This is reminding me a bit of that lovely Derroze 40. Similar red fruit notes. The finish is long and features oak with a lingering spice note. Big hug on the finish. When I shared this with the Distillery last night as I was tasting it they actually stated the distillers where schooled in the French distilling methodology and that Marc Derroze himself was visiting the Distillery next week! Talk about a small world!
Back to this pour. In short, it's a spectacular value and really quite unique in how it brings European spirit notes to a Texas Bourbon. The Euro Oak clearly making an impact to this profile in the best way! At $49.99 it's a great buy. 
Cheers all!"
4.0,"The mashbill is made up of 90% Yellow Corn, 5% Purple Corn and 5% Bloody Butcher Corn. 

Nose: Dusty corn, spice, caramel,  stewed apples.

Taste: Caramel, dusty, apples, dried fruit,  lot of green spice similar to some ryes I've had.

Finish: that spice lingers with caramel and dark dried fruit.

water: similar notes but sweeter."
1.5,Small faint sweetness with not a lot of other things going on.  Tastes sweet at first and followed by let the fire rain down your throat..... the more you drink this the more harsh it became I don’t know why this bottle is that expensive.... at $47.49 there are a lot of other options that are way better
3.25,"1 ice cube. Spicy yet mellow. Beautifully done for a Texas bourbon. Complex and interesting, but still a bit harsh."

4.0,"Ironroot Republic is a distillery in Denison, TX opened in 2013 by two brothers, Robert and Jonathan Likarish. The name Ironroot pays tribute to Texas ""iron"" grape roots that were used to save the French wine industry from an invasive insect that was killing the vines in 1800's. The brothers found it inspirational in adapting the process of distilling to unique climate of Texas instead of attempting to copy a specific flavor profile.
The Likarish brothers are constantly experimenting with different barrel sizes, different barrel entry proofs, as well as using heirloom grains.
Earlier releases I've seen were 18 months old and 118.5 proof. This particular bottle is aged 27 months and 115 proof. The mash bill supposedly contains 4 different types of corn, including purple and Bloody Butcher heirloom varieties, as well as rye.
This is definitely not your average bourbon. While it does have some telltale notes that give away its relatively young age, it's easily forgivable due to the bomb of flavors it packs.
On the nose there's maple syrup, baked cinnamon apple, toasted oak, and some ethanol burn. On the palate you get hit with molasses, cinnamon brown sugar, maple syrup, coffee, more oak, fresh cut grass notes and orchard fruit flavors. Finish is fairly long with cinnamon spice and heat, more oak, brown sugar, and grassy notes which is probably from the rye in mash bill. The mouthfeel ends very dry and tannic which is a quality I tend to pick up in whiskey aged in smaller barrels. However, I'm not certain what size of barrels are used here and it could very well be the result of Texas climate. I was told by the spirit manager at a Total Wine that this bottle will soon be extremely hard to find, not sure what that means but I'm glad I picked it up!"
3.75,Been open for 4 months now and has opened to a much nicer flavor profile! Its tasty now!
1.5,"Been wanting to try an Ironroot for a while, they hype on these is beyond words.

Nose - Oh god....clay putty, please don't like this be another turd like Garrison Brothers! Ok a bit more nosing and there's some sweet notes, its' way better than Garrison brothers. Overall still the nose on this sucks and frankly it smells nothing like bourbon. 

taste - So I brought the abv way down for this review as I want to get into the notes. There's that clay funk that I get in Garrisons which is simply off putting and frankly if Texas bourbon wants to be a quality product long term they need to get rid of it. I get maple notes which is unique. some red hots, and there's a good nice sweetness. 

At the end of the day this tastes like younger whisky. It has off notes. It does have some redeeming quality elements. It's complex, actually really complex, and I think there's some real quality going into this one. 

I personally can't get past the nose or that clay flavor to give this a high score but once again I can tell they're on their way. Over priced for the flavor, absolutely. But for a startup distillery trying to find their grounds and for how unique it is, I'm pretty happy with the price.

For bourbon drinkers this is a 0 out of 100. It doesn't taste like bourbon. For people who love whisky this is a 50 out of 100, it's really interesting but you'll likely not enjoy it. For whisky geeks looking to explore, this is a 75. For a distillers score I don't know. Calling it bourbon is really a problem for me as there is no bourbon note in this bottle. I don't see this going in coke well. 

OK I'm adding ice - the way bourbon drinkers drink their stuff normally anyway. OK I'm getting waxy corn and vanilla. This is starting to taste like bourbon. Oddly enough I don't get the oak notes of a bourbon. That's what's killing this for me. One would think massive oak in that heat but instead I don't get the oak.  I think that's the issue. This isn't bourbon tasting because I don't get the first charred oak. 

As you can clearly tell I really want to give this a high score. I don't think that texas heat works with grain whisky. Going 1.5. There's quality here, there really is but this isn't bourbon and it isn't one I'll ever buy again. A 1.5 isn't bad though, it's a good fair score for a whisky that frankly for me isn't good but I can see the quality and realize there is a niche for this."

4.75,Came back to try the newest batch 2019-B even better than the 2019 I had. More robust and flavorful even though it is just 3 months older.
3.0,I was hoping to really like this from the Scotch Test Dummies great review but now after being open for 2 months and down 1/4 of the bottle to get some air I have to say I don't like it very much. Has severe alcohol burn even watered down to 92 and the flavors to me are not that good for my palate.

null,Possibly the worst whiskey I’ve tried. Too hot on the palate and weak flavors on the finish.
4.5,Delicious complex sweetness made of vanilla and maple. Slight fruitiness and a strong cinnamon that’s takes it right to the edge with alcohol bite before a lovely charred oat finish

4.25,"Tried this at the distillery.
You get that caramel/molasses note with some spice. Also deep, rich fruit flavors come out with some oak. Very good and has some nice earthy flavors from the multiple corn mash. Try it if your looking for something different than your typical bourbon."

2.0,"Decent whiskey, but a little disappointing when I had bourbon on the mind. Good nose, with strong notes of maple syrup, but the pallette and mouth feel leave much to be desired. I'm looking forward to trying longer aged whiskies from Ironroot as I'm certain this will benefit from more time in the barrel."
3.25,After sampling much better bourbons I'm bringing this one down .5 point and also will not buy again. Much better bourbons out there for the price. Notable alcohol burn after watering down to 92 proof and being open for many months.
3.75,"Nose: sweet and fruity: maple, apple with cinnamon 

Palate: rich spicy with cinnamon and rye

Finish: long cinnamon and rye with mouth dryness

Edition 2019B, aged 27 months, 57.5% ABV

Good to have on the shelf for the high proof and interesting flavor"
2.5,Ooooh weee. That burn on the throat.
