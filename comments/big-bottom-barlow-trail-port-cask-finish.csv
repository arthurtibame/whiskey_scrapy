3.0,"Spicy nose with honey overtone that already gives hints of raisin. The pallette is raisin through and through. Unique and tasty, but probably not my first reach for a whiskey."

4.5,Very nice locally (Oregon) bottled port finish whiskey. Had on the rocks and very smooth but still has character.

4.0,Nose initially has a strong alcohol but the port berries do come through. Sweet and oily on entry with vanilla and subtle notes of oak and leather. Finish is a bit harsh with more oak and the port is there with a medium burn that lingers just enough. 3.5/5

3.0,"Batch #8. $37.99 in OR. The whiskey pours a ruby red hue. After hints of caramel and sweetness on the nose, the port influence becomes immediately apparent. The port comes through even stronger on the taste with a beautiful, rounded sweetness and moderate tartness that lingers nicely on the palate and finishes like a robust red wine. This whiskey is a little hot, but the alcohol burn can be tamed nicely by a drop or two of water. Everything about this whiskey, from the aesthetics to the taste, is enjoyable. I'm looking forward to keeping this one on the shelf and seeing how it opens up. At $38, I am more than pleased with my purchase."
