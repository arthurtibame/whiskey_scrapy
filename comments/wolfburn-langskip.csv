3.5,"Oily smooth, bourbon cask, stronger with water"
3.5,"Wolfburn tasting evening at The Oak Barrel, Sydney, May 30th 2019: Whisky #5

Nose: Big, sweet floral and fruity. Butterscotch and toffee with fruit aromas. There are some hints that remind you this is a young spirit (the slight hard and almost metallic notes). On the whole this is very much like the Northland expression on steroids. A slightly soapy aroma is the only off note.

Palate: Sweet and smooth with a somewhat hot arrival from the high abv (however there's no intrusive ethanol note). Some vanilla and the characteristic Wolfburn spice character is still present but it's now well into a supporting role. The texture is oily and quite thick. There is a slight tannic intrusion but the main fault (if indeed it is a fault) of the palate is simplicity. There is no substitute for maturity, and this spirit needs more time in the cask to achieve greatness.

Finish: Medium/long. The spicy notes are the main feature, and they gradually fade  into a sweet aftertaste.

Langskip (i.e. ""longship"") is a cask-strength release matured exclusively in first-fill bourbon casks for 5 years.  It's a big and very spirit-forward whisky as the casks have not had enough time to have a meaningful influence on the distillate.  Water opens the palate and revives the spice notes, but tends to further reveal the simplicity of the profile at the same time.

If it has a main fault it is that it is short-lived and falls apart quickly. It's a classic example of a great spirit released too soon. Obviously they have had to do this for commercial reasons - and make no mistake, it is a good whisky, but I'd love to taste this with a further 5 years of maturation when it has gained some composure and authority. At that time it would probably be quite awesome.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars (almost 4)"
