5.0,"St George has been my white whale for some time so I was excited to finally get some into my glass. It did not disappoint. This is a beautifully balanced malt, a serious, confident whisky that is leagues ahead of its American brethren. The influence of the fortified wine barrels introduces itself through aromas of stewed fruits and bananas. There’s a rush of cream on the first sip that swells into a rich crescendo of honey and a long throat-coating finish that leaves the dark sweet notes in your mouth for an age. There’s a hint of smoke too on the back end, courtesy of some unroasted barley that is smoked over beech and alder wood. To put in another way, think of a Midwinter Night’s Dram spliced with Talisker and Old Pulteney DNA and you’re in the right ballpark. I had a smaller sample of Lot 15 too, which was very different: a fresh spicy nose with hints of raspberry tea and a classic malty body. I’d rate that a notch below the 17, though I didn’t really have enough to get to know it well. Regardless, consider me slayed by St George."

5.0,"Outstanding representation of a single malt Irish style by a great distillery. Grassy and salty, sweet cereal grain, light light light peat smoke, floral finish. Hard to find...like a jackalope."
3.0,"Deep copper color. Honey and burnt orange then chocolate on the nose. Initial Taste of chocolate and leather. Overall not bad, but I don't think I would buy it again."
