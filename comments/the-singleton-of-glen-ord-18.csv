4.0,Favorite birthday present this year. Has a caramel quality and a decent finish. Didn't need to blow out the candles for the wish to come true.
4.0,"Visited this distillery when over there, this particular distillery only sends there bottles to south east asia, so a rare find in the states. I preferred the 15 to the 18 as it has more of the ex-bourbon oak in the mix rather than the sherry casks. The 18 was more complex though with definate notes of caramel and the sherry flavor comes through nicely."
