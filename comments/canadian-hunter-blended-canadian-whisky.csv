1.5,"Appearance: The color of this Canadian blend is a khaki or dark gold. Thin and exceedingly viscous legs cling to the interior of the glass.

Nose: The nose starts off nice then shows its true colors, but overall, it’s boring. Notes of honey and floral come first, followed by caramel, nail polish remover, and car exhaust. The nose then drops and it becomes hard to detect anything, which probably isn’t a bad thing at this point. 

Taste: For lack of a better word, it's very smooth. There’s no bite, (which is something their old advertisements hit on often) there's a note of caramel candy, a herbal note mixed with green grapes, then a bitter note toward the end of the swallow. Overall, not bad.

Finish: There is a medium length finish with no burn, followed by a grain spirit aftertaste.

Thoughts: I feel this whisky could use a higher proof, and that would make it a bit more interesting, but I know there are better things in the world than this. It’s one of the cheaper Canadian whiskies out there, but I would fork over a few more dollars for something higher quality. It is, for the most part, inoffensive but it’s boring. I won’t buy it again and don’t recommend it. Sorry Canadian Hunter. Cheers!"
