4.0,"Nose: peat, green Apple, pear, apricots

Palate: very lagavulin style but more strong because of the 56.5%"

4.5,"On the nose, an explosion of well-roasted bacon on pine wood, with a lot of salt and anchovy paste. Balsamic touch to round off the peated blow. Intense and penetrating, for the lovers of the genre (Me! Me!), a real show.
Hot pepper greets at the first sip, bowing immediately to the pungent marine peat (anchovies marinated on the barbecue?), accompanied by an unexpected sweet shade of apricots and pear, as if they had made fruit skewers on the burning wood. Citrus fruits, salted caramel, and again the balsamic note that flows in the background. Full-bodied and chubby, anything but cuddly though, a sort of fisherman with a jovial soul (like that of Big Peat but with an easy laugh).
Long finish, of embers, sea and caramel.
What a strange drink! A Lagavulin you don't expect, very funny and balanced, offering a demanding but satisfying drink."
5.0,Cask Strength + Lagavulin. Nick Offerman/Ron Swanson would be proud.
