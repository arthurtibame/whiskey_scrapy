5.0,"I had a sample of this at a Glen Grant tasting, and it is absolutely to die for. On the nose, there's a complex spiciness, savory raisin quality, pipe tobacco, and almond. I could nose this all day and not get bored. It's the palate, though, that knocks this one out of the park - dried fruits, pipe tobacco, leather, Marcona almond, vanilla, toffee, even a little petrichor (damp earth). My notes include the phrase ""this is what God tastes like."" Maybe I was a little caught up in the moment, but this is really delicious."
