4.5,"Another rare finding, a very vintage bottle (from 1976), in a porcelain decanter, 43%abv (86 proof), but lots of flavor and interesting notes here. This Old Fitzgerald conmemorates the bicentennial celebration of the United States of America. It even has some of the original patriots drawn in the bottle (not talking about Tom Brady here lol!).

On the nose, Brown sugar; Old banana that has gone like brown. Grain sugar sweetness. Soap.

On the palate, Banana, Prunes; feels Much more ""bourbonish"". Soap and Pepper.

Aftertaste is also very good and interesting. It feels dusty, like old. Ginger notes and has some overall dust note. 

This is a good whiskey. It has been made to celebrate and in a very fancy way. It is not something i would drink daily (specially since this is a very rare and expensive bottle) but i can say it exploits my scoring system to get this high score: 91/100."
