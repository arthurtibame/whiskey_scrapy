2.75,"I think what Gordon & MacPhail did to this Miltonduff is really something special. I like the balance of fruitiness and maturity. The tastes really work well together. While it is pleasant and light, it doesn’t fall short of intensity and character. An Irish friend of mine said it comes really close to Irish triple distilled whiskies while it being a proper Speyside scotch."
