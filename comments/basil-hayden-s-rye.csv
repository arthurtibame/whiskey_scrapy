3.0,"The low ABV means this tastes a little watery compared to many of the premium ryes on the market, but there are still some enjoyable spice notes on this, such as ginger. I don’t have much in the way of notes from my tasting at FIne & Rare in New York, but it’s an easy drinker with a nice spicy finish."

Palate: thin, watery grain, slight brown sugar, cinnamon spice linger

Maybe my bottle needs to open up more, but this is a sorry excuse of a rye under a premium label. Thankfully I got this bottle from work, but it’s not worth the $40 price tag. Zero depth, watered down - when will the Basil Hayden line come up in proof and stop diluting flavor?"

3.75,"Easily the best in the Basil Hayden line-up so far . Easy enjoyable sipper that is a great entry way into ryes . That being said, isn’t  so simple that it’s without its merits . Came in the top 3  of a blind rye flight for our group of 8 bottles against a strong lineup of rye big boys names , for example beating out baby saz and templeton rye . 3rd behind AE rye and Michters rye"

4.0,"[11.16.2019] Went to the local Liquor Barn in Louisville last week in lieu of a distillery tour. We were down for NAILE and couldn't peel away from the charming Cottswalds and Southdowns for longer than a booze run. Luckily Basil's was running a tasting that afternoon. And boy, what a crowd that place can draw on a Saturday afternoon!

This whiskey has everything I like about the Basil with all the bonuses of Rye. Wouldn't own the original but I would've bought a bottle of this if it weren't for the line at the register. Peppery without a harsh spicy bite, this is more like the pumpernickel version of rye and less like the white dog stuff I can buy at home. The extra time in oak barrels gives this a raw oak, woody, tannin flavor that adds complexity to what most other places would just run out as a decent rye whiskey."

3.0,"A- light honey, like the first batch of maple syrup. 
N- very slight ethanol, light Carmel and butterscotch, smoothed out with vanilla notes 
T- classic bourbon notes, but gentle. Slight bite - due to the rye - but reasonable heat. 
M- light oily, slightly more than water. Coats the tongue, not the mouth. 
O- clearly an entry level to the premium levels. Not bargain basement stuff - not by a long shot - but also not in the same caliber as Bookers, Bakers, or Knob Creek - of which this shares the Jim Beam small batch. Very good taste - but I feel like when you’re into the ‘good stuff’ this is just too weak to be the ‘good stuff’. Probably perfect for hipsters wanting to think they’re classy without putting in the work!"
