5.0,"nCV19 edition : opening up a top tier sample , cause...why not—-My family and I are still alive and virus free...for now. 

This is different level stuff.  This is the type of whisky that will be worth multiples of its current price in a few years.  It’s a double maturation single cask—-so they took one cask which was matured in bourbon barrel for about 11 years, and then took that single cask and matured it in Oloroso for 10 more years.  Whoever thought of that for this particular cask deserves a medal of some sort—-that cask selection was superb.   Produced a total of 322 bottles. 

Tabacco, linseed oil, pine...oysters, and finally you get an amazing sweet marmalade finish.  I’ve had a lot of Islay, from young brutes to elegant older ones that are deeply complex, but this one is the best Islay I’ve ever had.  Hands down.  

Unfortunately I only had a 6cl sample.  In retrospect, I wish I bought a bottle.  If you see this—-buy on sight.  

Addendum:  the 1981 single cask oloroso Laphroaig 27 is about $5000.  This came out at $400.  Kicking myself for not buying this..."
