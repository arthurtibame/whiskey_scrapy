3.75,"Ok - so some redemption here. Wasn't a fan of the standard Peated Malt, but at a higher %   alcohol some inroads have been made. Much more potent bite on the nose - much more smoked/campfire. Palate is slightly more oily with a confusion of flavours - hint of spice and smoke. A more drawn out finish than the standard. Reminds me more of an Irish Peat like Connemara."

4.0,"The final dram of the lot and my 2nd favorite. As mentioned in my review of the Sovereign version of their whiskey their typical style of peated whiskey is the lighter peated profile. Almost reminds me of Highland Park in a way (the peat profile) which is why I liked this range. The last dram of the flight of several was an excellent end to the tasting. I really enjoyed sitting back and chatting to David. He even invited my two kids in and chatted away to them and let them have a look round the distillery. Top bloke! Anyhow this is similar to the std 46% peat dialled up a notch. As David mentioned you get almost a 'snap crackle pop' bursts of flavour on your tongue which a few drops of water evened out. All in all I'm impressed by the craftsmanship. The lighter style of whiskey is not my preference but David won me round. He waited for several years before releasing any whiskey and his patience, chemical /food science background and attention to detail really shine through in the whiskey. I'm looking forward to trying the tasting pack I bought with friends back in NZ."
