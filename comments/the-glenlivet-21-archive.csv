5.0,"Tasted with Laura Hay during presentation. Did not write notes so this is based on simple memory. This was a very complex whiskey which I think was matured in sherry casks. It had some spicy fruit characters, smoky oak and quite warming as well. There was a lot going on and a lingering finish."

4.0,"Lots of things going on as you would expect from a single malt in this price point: very smooth with flavors of fruit, smoke and wood. Medium finish with no dominate flavors, everything blends well together."

5.0,"Fist fill burbon cask. 5 or 6 burbon casks used in this whiskey. Enjoy it while you can. 

Pallet - hint of spice, can be enjoyed neat. Small hint of butter while holding on the pallet. 
Warm finish, welcoming, can enjoy all night beside a fire. 

By far my favorite scotch whiskey of all time."

3.0,"Glenlivet whiskies are always a little bit of a hit or miss with me (similar to Glenfiddichs), and this one is a miss unfortunately. If I could sum it up in a single sentence: it comes across as something that should have been bottled earlier. It just tasted overcasked, which is something I have rarely come across. Yes it's fruity (apples) and honeyed in the way you expect a Speyside, but the wood elements just don't work overall, like a tone deaf vocalist singing loudly in a choir. It's just too bad."

3.0,"​
  Let me start by saying I owe the opportunity to taste this whisky to my brother. He bought this bottle for my Dad's 80th birthday. Only problem is my Dad is not really a whiskey drinker, and definitely not Scotch. This is definitely out of my price range, and after tasting it I'm glad I didn't pay for it.
  The Glenlivet Archive is a 21 year old expression matured in American oak and ex-Sherry oak casks. It is a beautiful dark amber color that attests to its 21 years in those barrels. There is no statement as to whether or not it is non-chill filtered, and is 43% ABV. Swirling in the glass produces a thick oily coating that produces nice long legs.
  Upon nosing this dram I immediately got caramel and toasted marshmallow with some toffee notes. After about 15 minutes in the glass it was still the same. I was hoping for more complexity from something this old but it just wasn't there. Maybe the taste would reveal more?
  In the mouth it has more of the same. Strong toffee sweetness with some oak notes. Others might pick up some other flavors but I couldn't. Just that overpowering sweetness.
  The finish finally produced something other than the caramel/toffee flavors, being fairly long and much drier with some peppery oak tones.
  This is a very good whisky, but considering the $110+ price tag, I can't recommend it very much. I've had better whiskies at half the price. Maybe not ""better"", but more complex and intriguing. I appreciate the chance to taste it, but I won't be saving up to buy a bottle. 3.5. Cheers!"

3.0,"It is very difficult for me to rate such a quality vintage product, with such a fine pedigree, this low.  This is the first >20yr scotch I have tasted.  I expected much more.  All the beloved distillery notes I love from Glenlivet products are missing.  Old musty smoke flavors arrive as the pour airs out in the glass.  I am not a big fan of smoke or peat.  Smoke overpowers other notes.  I was also expecting more richness and a more creamier mouth feel.  I think the 18 year might be the sweet spot at a much lower price point.(less than half)  I just can't abide $300 for this bottle."

4.25,"A beautiful expression of The Glenlivet that i was eager to taste. Finally i have had it and it was a fancy dram, easy drinkable and smooth, a little too straightforward maybe.

Bottled at 43%abv.

On the nose i really pick a lot of notes that i would normally get from the Glenlivet 15yo french oak. A very refined aroma. Vanilla cake, Raisins, Fruitcake. Amazing
And Fancy aroma, sherriness is present.
Custard cream and Pineapple.

On the palate, this is a wonderfully light whisky. Very smooth, Vanilla, custard cream and cake. Just as the nose.

Aftertaste is where something slightly is offered, a very bitter, truly bitter tobacco note (fantastic). Ginger. Super pleasant finish. 

Overall this is a fancy dram, made for people who can afford it and want a very smooth straightforward whisky. 89 over 100 is my score for it. Very pleasant experience."
