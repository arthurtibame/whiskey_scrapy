4.0,"Incredibly rich and full bodied on the nose with warm sugars, raisins, and baking spices. The palate is just as pleasing. Rich with a bit of an oily texture. The baking spices remain with added hints of dried fruits, finalized by chocolates and hazelnut flavors left on the back of the tongue."
