2.0,"I'm in LA for business, and I figured why not have something local (well...if not local, maybe at least from the same state).    I saw this on the shelf, while inhaling my free premium rewards member appetizers.  The guilty half of me figured I should pay for something after devouring three cheese  plates, 8 skewers, and half a bottle of olive tapanade with freshly baked sourdough.  The adventurous part of me wanted to try something different, even as bat crazy as whiskey infused with black truffles.  Not sure it works.  This is unusual, with aromas of...guess, what?  Truffles.  An earthy, wet soil, aroma of truffles.  Taste carries through, with more....truffles.  Earthy, almost gamey.   Not sure I'd be buying a bottle anytime soon.  I prefer my truffles on pizza, pasta, and eggs.  And whiskey by itself."
