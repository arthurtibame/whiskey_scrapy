4.0,"Strong sherry and strident alcohol sting on the nose. Dried dates and plums, a whiff of the slightest hint of peat smoke. Brown sugar. Vanilla on the fringe, maybe with cinnamon and nutmeg. Pear. No oak at all but sherried wood very apparent. Vague allusion to cocoa.

The palate has tons of sherry at first; very hot in the tongue with a lot of orange zest. Slight raisin. Brown sugar. Nutty. Smoke comes in only slightly at the end.The strength of the sherry makes it harder to parse out other components. Warming finish carries cocoa, more of the walnut nuttiness, and a slightly minty zest. Ends with a very wooden note; not oak but dried sherry cask."

Good sherry finish that stays with you quite a while. I'm normally not a fan of sherry bombs like Glenfarclas, but this expression is well-balanced.

4.0,"Nose: Sherry, spice, raisins, stone fruits, good oak without being too woody, Dundee cake, chocolate and a note of bay leaf.

Palate: The arrival is immediately sherried, but not over-sweet or fruity. As it develops a broad spectrum of subtle spice emerges on a malty, bready, cereal foundation. Raisins, sultanas, dates and walnuts – rather like walnut bread, in fact. There’s a light hint of smoke in the background, balanced by a tiny whiff of mint and caraway seed.

Finish: Long and satisfying. Christmas cake flavours slowly fade away.

This is an updated review. I originally rated this at 3 stars about 18 months ago and found little to praise at the time, however I’m very happy to say that the most recent batch of Glenfarclas 15 is right back in top form. A stunningly good Speyside/Highland single malt in the prime of the distillate’s life – just enough time to enhance the big, bold Glenfarclas new-make character, but not so long as to become overly well-mannered.

As with all Glenfarclas, please give this time to relax in the glass so it can show its true colours. Their whisky is always a bit reticent straight from the bottle and needs space to breathe. A small dash of water helps this process but again give it time to combine properly with the spirit. Glenfarclas has to be taken at its own pace, which is slow and measured, and if you do so the rewards are great. Rush it and you’re only getting a fraction of the story.

“Very Good” : 4 stars"

4.0,"All this time, and I've never actually written up notes on this, one of the treasures (by which I mean whiskies not commercially available in the US) I brought home from Scotland this past summer. The bottle was purchased at the distillery after our tour, and it was money well spent. The nose overflows with the sherry-influenced profile that's to be expected from Glenfarclas; in the 15, I get dark brown sugar, fig jam and vanilla cake (almost like a Fig Newton), almond brittle, and...waxy shoe polish. Medium bodied with a slight nip of alcoholic heat, the palate does have an ever so slight waxy quality to it. Flavors of candied plum, dried fig, almond, pastry crust, and vanilla come to the forefront; with a drop of water, there's a minty note at the very end. An ever-so-slightly bitter note rounds things out and keeps this from being a total dessert dram. A lovely, fairly priced (from what I remember) dram that I wouldn't mind see cross the pond!"

3.0,"My initial impression of this wasn't very positive. It certainly wasn't bad, but I wasn't getting the ""Christmas cake"" notes I've seen attributed to it in most reviews. There was something off about it that wasn't sitting right with me. After working through a third of the bottle that started to change. The strange, vaguely off-putting note I encountered right away has receded, replaced by appetizing shortbread, cereal and all-spice or cinnamon notes. The unidentifiable note was still there, but at a comfortable distance. A whisky friend described it as ""carob"". Certainly possible. The dram is improving as I work through the bottle, fast becoming a favorite. This is my first Glenfarclas, so I'm not sure if the ""carob"" notes I found unpalatable right after opening are typical or not. Given the high cost of importing this to the US, I'm not sure I'd buy it again until I've sampled some of the standard bottlings available locally - the 12, 17 or 25 perhaps."
3.0,"3.6
Reminds me of the nectar d'or nose, but better. Honey! Leaving it for 15min with a splash of water opened up the dram and brought out the sherry. This is a very different dram than the Glendronachs or the Aberlours of this world. Not smooth - alcohol burn."

4.0,"Damn! Or should I say dram! If you enjoy an abundance of sherry influence in your whisky, this is the bottle for you. The nose has strong notes of caramel and dried fruit, particularly raisins. The liquid itself is medium bodied to the mouth, with sherry oak and raisins taking spotlight. The finish is long and almost anesthesizing, with a predominance of spice and vanilla. Quite complex and enjoyable."

Taste - Honey baked apples, orange zest, ginger spice, light golden raisin sweet, subtle metallic fruit.

Finish - Gentle pleasant ginger warmth, honey apple danish, light metallic apple/grape juice.

Score - 81/100

Final Thoughts - So the slightly higher proof here might have balanced out the younger age and it helped get rid of any off-putting bitter notes. What's strange is there's this weird metallic note I get like this has been vatted/stored in a metal vat for too long & has picked up that slight metallic vibe. I guess the strong point for Glenfarclas might be higher proof, heavily sherried, or older age to get rid of this metallic taste.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

3.75,"Nose: Dry strawbery marmelade. Chocholate covered marzipan. A light touch of peat (not smoke, there are little to no phenoles here; ”non-smoke peat” if you follow). There is also some sulphur, comming through, 95-97% like funky cool gunpowder, but 3-5% like in an ”eggy” way. The latter is manageable though and only noticable if you really look for ut. Deeper sniffs reveal darker dried fruits, typical ”sherry” notes like raisins and dried plums, as well as a touch of caramel/toffee.

Palate: More of the dry strawberry jam. Woody tannins (but not overpoweing).Christmas cake comes to mind. Also a touch of coffee crema (the foam which forms on an espresso). Also a touch of (the taste of) alcohol. The texture is not as ”thick” as some other sherried whiskys. 

Finish: Short-to-medium long finish. (I had hoped for a longer finish to be honest.) The strawberry jam continues, sweeter now. Coffee with a touch of chocholate (if you ever tried like chocholate infused Nespresso?). On the end of the finish the chocholate becomes more prominent - and darker.

Overall: I like the notes in this whisky. It is an unpeated sherried whisky which comes through as a peated one - in the sense that it holds qualities that I usually just find in peated sherried whiskys (the peat imo somehow tends to subdue overly dark notes in sherried whiskys). That said, some aspects of this whisky are somewhat underwhelming such as the slightly thin texture and shorter-than-other-sherried-whiskys finish. It’s still really good though, and I do enjoy it for its upside qualities, and I score it 3.75 which is the mark of a really good and tasty whisky, but being one step below being a great whisky."

3.5,"Glenfarclas tasting night at The Oak Barrel, Sydney, 4 July 2019. Whisky #2

Nose: Sherry, malt, dark fruitcake, baked raisins, a resinous note. It's a very rich and muscular nose and there's a faint smoke aroma, but it's more like slightly overcooked cake or bread than peat-reek.

Palate: A rich, spicy and oak-prominent arrival. Medium-dry sherry, dates, raisins, dark cherries, boiled fruit pudding, orange marmalade, walnuts and Brazil nuts. There's also very slight caraway seed and mint notes, and the texture is big, mouth-watering and almost chewy.

Finish: Medium. The palate fades out to a dark fruitcake aftertaste with some resinous, tannic dryness.

A more demanding malt than 10 or 12 year old Glenfarclas, this whisky requires some time in the glass to open.  The musky floral aromas that stand out in the younger expressions are still present, but this whisky also has a resinous oaky aroma and a dry spiciness on the palate. These tend to mask the lighter floral tones and add complexity.

For some the 15 year old is the standout of the ""younger"" Glenfarclas expressions, however I've always found it to be very tightly wrapped and harder to approach than the fruitier and less woody 12 year old. It is also one of the must inconsistent malts in the range and I've given it from 3-4 stars here in previous ratings. The batch last year was very good, but this current one lacked engagement for me.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"
