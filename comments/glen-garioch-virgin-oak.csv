3.5,"Smells like a musty barrel, peanut shells.  Wood spice.

Picks up some more bourbony notes.  Very barrel forward, but the malt stands up pretty well.  Toasted barley on the tongue.  Woody and spicy."

4.25,Lots of vanilla and sweetness in mouth. Not overly complex but a lovely dram. Girlfriend loved it and we got a bottle at the distillery.

4.0,Well balanced for 48%. Loved the viscous bourban vanilla and honey flavours. My favorite out of the two Glen Gariochs (the other being the 12). 4 at least for this one.

4.0,"Despite being a NAS, this expression is actually more pleasant than the 12, and the 48% ABV really allows the full aromatic profile of this whisky to please the palate. While the use of virgin oak casks is similar to bourbon, the difference in taste couldn't be more pronounced: cinnamon, apricots, mint, and barley. The finish is particularly rich and satisfying, lingering in your mouth for minutes on end. Delicious!"
