1.25,"Nose: Very light and spirity at first nosing. Gradually some mild citrus, apple and vanilla notes emerge but it remains distant and unimpressive.

Palate: Sweet arrival mainly featuring vanilla and cereal. The development brings out some shy honey and dried fruit but little else. The texture is slightly creamy. 

Finish: Medium/short. Grassy cereal and a little woody citrus note in the aftertaste.

23rd Street Distillery was established in Renmark, South Australia in 2016 and they have just released their first single malt. However to generate cash-flow while it was maturing they produced a range of brandy, rum, gin and vodka. Keen to bring something whisky-like to market as soon as possible they also created this curious dram which has been around for a couple of years now, but unsurprisingly is almost unknown.

It comprises scotch whisky that is ""an average of 5 years old"". Hmm. Whether it is malt or grain is unspecified but I'd bet my bottom dollar it's 100% grain whisky.  The other component is an unidentified bourbon that is ""an average of 2 years old"". Hmm again. The resulting blend is married in ex-bourbon barrels for an unspecified time. There is very little real information on their website regarding this expression - it's all just marketing fluff and their lack of transparency borders on patronising.

The nose takes a while to open but even when it does it remains thin and uninteresting. It's the nose of a low-grade blended scotch with way too much young grain whisky. Far in the background there are some caramel notes. The palate is light and inoffensive, but makes no real impression. Overall it is like a cheap blended scotch with the addition of a teaspoon of indifferent bourbon.

The only reason I've not scored this even lower than I have is because for all it's blandness it is at least free of objectionable faults. However I would strongly NOT recommend this product, particularly at the rather steep asking price which is about three times what it is worth.

Tasted from a 200ml distillery-bottled sample.
