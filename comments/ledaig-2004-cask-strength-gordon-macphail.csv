4.0,"Gordon & MacPhail's Cask Strength range offered a good selection of high-quality drams before being discontinued in 2018. Matured in a combination of first and refill sherry hogsheads, this 2004 Ledaig could be mistaken for an Islay malt. The nose is complex and engaging with smoked ham, vanilla, iodine, lime and moderate peat smoke. Peppery and bold in the arrival, the taste develops with grapefruit and savory peatiness. Hints of sweetness, tar and a dash of salt characterize the long and warming finish. Peat addicts, do not underestimate Ledaig!
