2.75,Perhaps it was the hype from the LCBO employees but this left a lot to be desired for me.

2.0,not impressed at all.  I'll finish the bottle but i won't buy it again
3.0,"When I have the whisky on my nose I am reminded of a buttered popcorn in an old theatre or Carmel popcorn on Christmas Eve. It is antique-tasting, buttery, spicy, and carmely. I also get some vegetable oiliness. There is some smooth heat in the finish."

2.0,I agree with the stated assessment.
1.0,this is really bad.  I aged corn mash in basement one time with those 1 gallon barrells..... It was EXACTLY like that.
5.0,Sweet and balanced. Incredibly flavorful with just a slight tangy finish right on the nose. Barely any lingering and a wonderfully smooth finish. One of the best bourbons I've ever had.
2.0,"Wish I had good things to say about this other than that I got it fairly cheaply, but it'd be tough.  It's mashy, medicinal and frankly odd. It's got that young brashness, but coupled with a weird funk."
