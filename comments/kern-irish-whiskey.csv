4.0,"I got some vanilla and a nice smoky peat note. Better finish than Jameson. A bit hot, though; in my mind, Tully is the best Irish I have found in the US. But Kern compares nicely and at a fair price ($23 in the NC ABC).

I tried it chilled, and it is much smoother, without the burn. The Irish features really shine. I normally drink spirits neat, at room temperature. But this one really gets better when chilled."

3.0,"Very light, easy to drink, but almost tastes watered down. Slightly nutty, but otherwise unmemorable."
