4.25,"Quite a pleasant nose, fresh but with a whiff of smoke. Sweet bourbon profile but with more complexity. Some fruity, citrusy notes also. Vanilla on the palate and then smoke kicks in together with a spicy character. But overall still smooth. I enjoy the typical Bowmore characteristics but without the sherry cask influence. Medium finish."
