3.0,"This starts out with a sweet nose of ripe pears, black tea, honey and a slight amount of vanilla and orange zest. As it opens, a brininess and smoke make their way onto the aroma profile.  On arrival, the soft, mildly dense body delivers an initial current of honey tea, a bit of smoke and ground cinnamon. The finish is a bit hot and spicy and slightly bitter and oaky with a hint of a mild cigar.  A smidgen of water enhances the black tea and honey characteristics of the dram.  A good dram at a fantastic price. I am searching for a JWB substitute (I have a place in my heart for it, however price creep has tended to keep this out of my collection) and this could be it. This is a great, cheaper alternative to JWB and one I will be sure to have around when I am looking for a quality blend. [$18][86/100][Opened: 4/19/15][Revisited: 11/1/15; 1/24/16]"
3.0,A good amount of smoke up front which is great but isn't followed up by much.
3.0,*note: this is for the prior bottling not shown in the Distiller profile* The mouthfeel of this scotch is thick and oily. It carries some smoky attributes but the star here is a briny flavor that rides into a great finish. To describe this in one sentence: that refreshing feel of ocean spray after a day on the water.

A little raw, and fairly simple. Certainly not bad for the price, but this blend reminds me why I stick to Single Malts. This will make an excellent snow day dram. Dry glass: memories of an old musty wood-fire warmed museum workshop at Mystic Seaport..."

2.0,After all the reviews I was expecting peat and smoke notes. Very disappointed. For 30$ I could invest in much more flavorful drams. Could be bias as I'm a laphroaig lover which is notoriously peaty.

3.0,"The Black Bottle largely abandoned its 'Heart of Islay' a few years back, when they altered the blend for greater mainstream appeal. The ongoing bitterness of many peat-heads might blind one to the fact that this is still a decent, inexpensive blend. Toffee, floral honey, tropical fruits, with the barest whiff of old cigar at the end. Kinda like Highland Park Lite. It may not be the smouldering Islay treat it once was, but it's still a pretty good value."

2.5,"This Blended Scotch is not what it once was after the radical 'rebranding' to please market demands and make it 'easily accessible'. The aroma of Black Bottle is restrained with wood sap, bitter grain and some floral notes. Peat smoke? Nope. Tastewise, youthful harshness and sweet malt combine with honey, ginger and faint peatiness. Dominated by cheap grain whisky, the finish is bitter, short and altogether featureless. Having lost the characterful impact of Islay malts, this blend only remains a shadow of its former glory. It's drinkable - no more, no less.

RATING: 2.4/5.0 stars ≙ 70 pts → SUBPAR [-]"
5.0,"Considering the price, this is one amazing blended Scotch! Much more flavorful than Dewar's, and priced considerably lower than Johnnie Walker Black. This is an everyday kind of Scotch. Wouldn't be upset if we polished off a full bottle in a night. Wouldn't be surprised either."

null,Too sweet for my taste.  Not bad but very different.  I get a strong clove and nutmeg note with a mild peat which is present but barely featured.      and something sweet and fragrant like a perfume which I can't put my finger on.  I prefer Islay mist 8 year over this one in the bottom shelf range.  It's got more punch and isn't as sweet.

4.0,"Next one in my tasting line up (got several miniatures of whiskey and rum to test so expect some more in the future) 

The Black Bottle. Cool design, nice price (can get them for only a few euros more than a bottle of Jack Daniels). They look good on the shelf, but more importantly, they back up the looks with taste. 

On the nose I get a fistful of smoke with a stron smell of honey glazed grilled apples. I also get a grainy smell...like sweet full grain bread toasted. I really like it It almost reminds me of fresh toasted bread at the moment you but butter on it and it starts melting.Makes you want more. 

The taste backs this up, to a degree. I get salted caramel, a dash of peat, honeyed saltwater and also the faint taste of black tea with milk. 

It leaves a sweet aftertaste combined with salty sea air and hints of bitter smoke. Just enough to let you know it's there. 

For fans of heavily peated Islay stuff this is probably too friendly and sweet, for people slowly getting there I say it is a great start, especially for the price. 

One of the best budget whiskeys I had. Definatly gonna add this to my collection soon."

1.0,"Nose:  not a very strong nose.  A little bit of sweetness and fruitiness.  Barely any peat.  
Palate:  viscous, sweet, a little bit of malt and fruitiness.  
Finish:  short, mild spice
There is just not much going on in this whiskey.  There is nothing offensive, but nothing that great either.  Overall just lacking.  The biggest positive is that there is no astringent grain alcohol smell/taste that is often found in budget blends.  Relatively inexpensive but still not worth the price."

2.0,"The Bottle:  Distinctive and ""Old-Timey"". The gold label plays well with the black glass. The bottle design is an improvement over its predecessor, even if the malt isn't. 

In the Glass:  Dark gold. 

On the Nose:  This has a Highland/Speyside thing going on. The Islay that's in here (Bunnahabhain, if I recall) is practically nowhere to be found. Not much going on, mostly honey and cereal notes with some astringency. 

Taste:  Alright, so this is a young blend.  Very swift arrival with a moderate development. I get cereal, toffee and some honey sweetness; but that youthful astringency is every present.  I'm not sure if it's because I know the background of the blenders, or if I'm really getting it; but there is a faint ""Bergamont"" kind of Earl Grey finish on this that's quite nice. 

 I mean, it's $24, so set expectations accordingly. A decent blend, but the youthfulness is a bit too noticeable for me."

2.5,"Scotland, September 2017. Whisky #3.

Nose: Floral sherry, fruit and smoke. A thick porridge-like cereal aroma. Hefty for a blend but a little ham-fisted.

Palate: Smooth and sweet arrival, almost cloyingly floral and smoky. A definite cider-malt flavour like fermenting wort. Tobacco, nutmeg, toasted bread.

Finish: Short/medium. Smooth but trailing into a touch of bitterness.

An enjoyable and rich blend that is best neat, over ice or with water. The only big fault is a tendency to become a little overbearing after the first dram. It is a self-consciously “masculine” blend that tries a little too hard. As a mixer it is almost too assertive.

This is an old blend that has gone through many changes over the years. At one time it boasted all available Islay malts in the recipe, but today Bunnahabhain is the only remaining Islay component (it is quite smoky so either it’s peated Bunnahabhain, or the peat is coming from some other malt).

John McDougall, who worked for many years with the company that owned the Black Label brand, says in his book “Wort, worms and washbacks” that it was always something of a mongrel blend, created from what was available at the time.  Some years it was not produced at all if there was insufficient necessary malt available, and the character often varied. Apart from that it has changed hands many times and the overall profile has been completely altered several times, varying from light and fruity to deep and smoky.

NOTE: Do not confuse this with the Australasian bottling of Black Bottle, which is totally different. See separate review for that blend.

  “Average” : 2.5 stars"
4.0,"A 1 oz pour at Fet's Whisky Kitchen in Vancouver. A very decent somewhat smoky nose. Vanilla and oak, some fruity notes. Nice and fruity on the palate. Tried it next to the Smoky Black Grouse for comparison. 
      
      Much fuller,  rounder and sweeter on the nose than the Grouse, though the Grouse is acceptable.
      
      The nose on the Grouse is considerably lighter and thinner. There is a trace of smoke on the Grouse. 
      
      The Black Bottle is fuller and sweeter on the palate. 
      
      I give it to the Black Bottle by a considerable margin, though the Black Grouse remains a minimally acceptable sipper. On a scale of 100 I give Black Grouse a 75 and Black Bottle about 85."

3.0,"For being the cheapest scotch I’ve tried so far it’s really not bad. It has a unique depth that does come across like slow baked, gently spiced apples with maybe a tiny hint of smoke. Unfortunately it finishes dry and flat. But hell, it’s $30 a bottle!, in Ontario."
3.25,"Nose: Starts off with a tiny amount of ocean brine and a bit of smoke and over sweetened (brown sugar), damp Pu’er tea. Fades into honey, caramel apples, and even a bit of oranges. You can smell the grain if you really pay attention.
Palate: Full and oily, starts off fruity and sweet, then a tea bitterness (not tea notes, just the bitter finish of tea) crawls up, milk chocolate, then a trace of smoke. 
Finish: Medium finish, oak and a hint of smoke. 
Overall: Black bottle is a pretty well-made blend; I buy it regularly in my budget scotch rotation. It’s interesting enough, the notes are well done, and you don’t taste the grain sharpness from other budget blends. But you need to know this: as the bottle says, it is “curiously rich & slightly smoky”. This is not the all Islay blend that it used to be; it has as little smoke as possible while still being detectable. I suggest trying Te Bheag if you want more peat and the sea. I rate this 3, but add 0.25 for the excellent value."

3.0,"Well another blend to try. Ive read some good reviews on this and 86 proof is a plus as well. Poured neat, nose is some malt, sherried fruit and gentle wood. Bit of grain sneaks in there too but not overdone. The classy elegance of the Bunnahabhain single malt shines through the palate with soft sherry soaked malt and wood. Yes the grain holds it back but this is one of the best NAS blends Ive had. Finish is traditional fading malt, mild fruit with drying wood but no real off notes. Overall Im pleased with this blend. Its changed dramatically from the former heavy peat version. This doesn't really have much peat ( just a hint of sweet smoke) The only Islay left is the Bunna and that's fine with me. This is fairly rounded and the grain doesn't ruin the whole experience. Good solid blend......81/100 (blend score).......All that being said I would spend the extra Jackson or so and get the Bunna 12yr and explore high quality single malt"

Black Bottle – I get smoke only after trying the Deanston and Tobermory. It’s very light and nicely integrated.  On the nose I get apple, vanilla and Nestea iced tea.  The finish is spicy and surprisingly long.

Brand rep noted that the majority of the blend is Bunnahabhain. 

Great value, worth purchasing, really nice.

3.25,"This is a real nostalgia trip for me.  My grandfather used to drink this as a ‘special’ treat back in the late ‘70s / early ‘80s.  He passed away before I was of drinking age, but it has stuck with me as his ‘special’ dram.  I’ve had it often since then in its various rebrands and updated formulas, and I’ve enjoyed it often.

First off, this is an extremely easy whisky to drink.  The first taste is spicy and quite oaky, but it builds in sweetness (apple and golden syrup) as you take a few more sips.  The finish is spicy and a little ashy, although still sweet.

There isn’t the same alcohol hit you get from a lot of blended whiskies.  It’s not a complex dram, it doesn’t have a lot of layers to it, but it’s a pleasant and easy to drink whisky that I’m very happy to revisit - and not just for the nostalgia!  I’d have this before a lot of malts that are lauded by many!"

4.25,"This is definitely one of the better blends I’ve had. 

Other reviewers have stated that the current expression of Black Bottle [BB] doesn’t exhibit as much Islay character as previous incarnations. Unfortunately, I haven’t had the opportunity to try older versions of this stuff, but, to me, the current iteration is far more expressive and robust than any other “peated blend” I’ve ever tried. 

The mouthfeel is creamy and oily, and the finish is sweet and smooth. If I didn’t know better, I might think I was drinking a single malt. The unaged grain whisky notes are darn near undetectable to me, and the overall character of the blend seems expertly choreographed to showcase the subtle nuances of peat and sherry. 

There’s a slight bourbon note which could be attributed to the secondary aging in “new, American oak barrels,” according to the BB website. 

Regardless, this stuff is well worth the money, and is immensely enjoyable for both beginners and seasoned scotch enthusiasts."

On the nose is very ""common"", which makes it a decent dram: peat, orange, prunes, vanilla, caramel, almonds and some medicinal plants. Nothing out of the ordinary. 

On the palate is very very very easy to drink, it is like a candy. Caramel, bonfire, tobbacco, ashes notes, all in small proportions, smooth is the word. Finish is medium with oaky notes. Ordinary, maybe an everyday whisky. 69/100."

It’s serviceable, but not great. I’d compare it most in flavor profile to JW Red, particularly with the lingering bitter oak notes on the finish. I think it’ll find it’s home as a mixer on my bar."
