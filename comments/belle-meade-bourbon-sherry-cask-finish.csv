4.5,"I'll make this short, because there's not much I can say that hasn't been said before. Belle Meade is doing a fantastic job of sourcing some great bourbon and finishing it to perfection. Thanks to the generosity of @DigitalCork , I was able sample Belle Meade's sherry, mediera,and cognac finishes.  All were fantastic, but my favorite was the sherry.  The finish on this whiskey is a perfect fruity offset to the spicy bourbon, and brings just the right amount of enhancement without overwhelming.  Add me to the list of Belle Meade fans!"

4.75,"Wow. Sherry, rich chocolate, and dark fruits (blackberry, black cherry) in the nose, with a touch of oak and orange peel. Palate is also very fruit forward, revealing plums and raspberry, with a deep, beautiful depth of dark chocolate, vanilla, and heaps of brown sugar dusted with cinnamon and rye spice, which fade into an oak finish with slight tannins, leather, and cigar."

Texture: Hot
Flavor: Apple pound cake  up front, followed by plum and baking spice
Finish: Medium short, dark fruit into clove spice"
3.5,"Aroma - Vanilla and plums

Taste - brown sugar and tart plum. Sherry pops out towards the back.

Texture - weak, burn at the end. Very quick.

Finish- smokey and dry. Tastes like a Cab. In bourbon form.

Over priced for what you get."

4.5,"Absolutely delicious. Tons of fruit and vanilla on the nose. The flavor profile is barely ""bourbon"" but in a good way. Fruity with just a hint of cinnamon on the front. Sweet vanilla, apples and leathery finish on the back. Long, warm, pleasant finish. Reminds me of wild turkey masters keep Revival. Probably the sherry cask."
4.0,Gift from Ninas mom (birthday).  Really unique tastes with the Sherry cask finish.  Super smooth but a flavor profile that bites up into the nose.  Awesome experience.  (Store owner let us try the normal bourbon non-sherry in store and was much spicier).

Sherry influence is obvious throughout, with just a touch of smoke lingering on the finish that reminds me a bit of scotch. Delicious bourbon."

4.75,"I was hesitant to pull the trigger on this one due to some of the comments and having never had anything from Belle Meade before. But I’m glad I grabbed this. 

Maybe it’s because I usually drink Speyside scotches, but to me this bourbon is fantastic. I get a depth of flavor and complexity that reminds me of some of the better scotches I’ve had, that you (imo) typically don’t get from bourbon. 

It is incredibly smooth and while the nose has a lot of sherry character, I find the sherry subdued in the whiskey itself. It plays a nice background note to the more typical bourbon flavors and doesn’t get in the way. Sometimes I find the fruit of the sherry and the vanilla and caramel fight each other, but not here. I get far more brown sugar and molasses from the bourbon which benefits from the sherry nicely. 

Like a sherry finished Speyside, this bourbon isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoy that flavor profile I highly recommend this. Easily one of my favorite whiskeys, and I’m sorry I didn’t buy both bottles at the state store."

4.25,"So what makes a great finished Whiskey? In my opinion the biggest factor is that the Whiskey must drive the experience and the finishing simply enhances it. Too often with cask finished Whiskey the finishing overpowers the Whiskey itself. 

Here we have an MGP Bourbon blend between 9-11 yrs old that's finished in first fill Oloroso Sherry Casks sourced from Spain. Finishing time is at least 3 months. So how does it taste? Let's dive in...

Upon entry it's rich, viscous and a touch oily.... Raisins, cherries and tobacco lead with some clove in the background.... Oak starts to present itself with vanilla and allspice... Cocoa and array of baking spices on the long finish with more oak and some dried red fruits. Just lovely. 

From first sip thru the finish you know you are drinking a well aged MGP Bourbon... The DNA is all there.... The Sherry finishing just add wonderful fruits and added depth... All in all this is an excellent example of a well executed finished Bourbon. Probably the best Sherry or Port finished Bourbon on the market for under $100. Cheers All!"
4.75,Heaven in a glass.  That's it. Just pure bourbon brown sugar goodness.
5.0,"Final entrant in the cask finish BM. Cognac and Madeira were both 6-9yr blends. This guy is only 9-10 so age stated 9yr. I don't know if its the extra 3 years or the sherry finish but DAMN this is easily better than the others and I really liked the Madeira. This has a refinement and richness along the lines of high end scotch. The easy smoothness of the deep dense flavors set it apart. Poured neat, nose is succulent fruits, light maple and salted caramel with some nuts and oak. The rye is present but in check as well as ethanol . Palate is scrumptious with dark fruit, maple fudge, melted toffee, oak, butter and rye spice all tied together with a cohesiveness you have to taste to understand. This is bourbon for scotch lovers. Tastes more like it was sourced from Glendronach rather than MGP. Finish is long with the palate ringing true without going dry or bitter. Sweet toffee, some cigar leaf and buttery oak for miles. The overall experience is quite impressive. Really no discussion whether to purchase full bottle at price(70-80$). I will have this as BM is a unique profile on its own and well worth the base offering. This sherry finish 9yr takes it to another level and is elite imo......98/100... Easy recommend and purchase despite lower proof...That's another thing most of my top bourbons are high proof bruisers this one here doesn't need that to deliver the goods."

3.0,"Batch 18-11 Bottle 1502    90.4 proof

Hitting the bars, decided to do a Belle Meade discovery tour with this along with the cognac finish.  

First off this has a huge wham of sherry to the nose, I'm not sure I've had sherry that had as much sherry bouquet of spiced red sweetness.  The nose was fairly exceptional in that regard offering up only feint bourbon qualities mostly overshadowed by the wine cask influence. 

On the palate the oloroso sherry again takes over and jumps out in front, I was impressed since I've never been a huge fan of ""sherry finishes"" and this was indeed a better quality than some of the sherry finished scotch I've sampled. 

Unfortunately after the strong sherry notes dissipate there really isn't that much of a stout bourbon to take over.  The sweet bourbon notes are there just weakly holding on in the wake of the blitzkrieg of wine and red fruity opening.  If you had to make me guess I could as easily imagine it was Jim Beam finished in sherry casks as standard Belle Meade, so the overall disappointment of the big blast early on yields a fairly harsh letdown. 

The finish was almost lifeless and made me wonder if I had really taken a sip or just imagined it.   Maybe I was just sipping wine as the sherry was the only notable thing about the experience. This bottle barks loud but it's a mostly toothless hound doing the barking.  Given the pricing I've seen on these bottles I really can't say it's a recommend.   Anyone who likes the sherry style would do well to get a sample before dropping a large chunk of change on this as it can be pricey. 

While it's certainly not bad, I wouldn't go out of my way to try let alone buy this one."

3.5,"Tasted neat in a glencairn. Rested for ten minutes after the pour. This is a rich polished walnut color. There is some sheeting noted on the swirl, but little by way of legs. 

On the nose is sherry, ripe fruit, barrel wood, cinnamon, a tart note of blood orange, and a smidge of ginger. It's got a bit going on, but is slightly thin.

On the palette the sherry is very evident, sweetening the bourbon. It has a very creamy mouth feel, and there's healthy amounts of spice. The ginger and black pepper giving a nice warming finish. 

This is a very tasty bottle.  For $30 more, the Cask Select Sherry Finish is a full cut above.  I'd opt to spend a few more dollars and go there for the best experience with this sherry finished whiskey.  It's definitely the better ""after dinner"" quaff.

This is a solid pick in a finished bourbon.  It's a fun drink, but not an everyday drink."

4.0,"375ml in a three-bottle special cask finish series box.  Batch no. 18-07, bottle no. 1903.  Actually a great deal at $99.99, as buying the three bottles in 750ml totals $225.  Tasted all three in a row, Cognac-Madeira-Sherry.

Neat in Glencairn at home.  Nose is prominently sherry, sweet with some caramel and vanilla notes coming in.  Hint of apples.  Really nice.  Taste has oak and vanilla cutting straight through the sherry presence, with stone fruit and grape must lingering, then mild spice lasting through the finish.  Of the three in the cask finish series box, this has the nicest nose for sure, though the drop-off in the taste therefore is very noticeable.  I think, overall, I like the Madeira the most overall. 1/30/20."
