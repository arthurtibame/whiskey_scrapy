2.0,"The smoothest whiskey you will ever have.  Also the most flavorless whiskey you will ever have.

I will pass next time at any price.  

***edit - I ended up dumping some of this in my Infiniti bottle and the rest down the drain*** tasteless!!"

3.0,"Barrel 28 -18  The very first thing you will note about this Sazerac offering is the exact, and I mean EXACT replication of the Blantons bottling process.  From the little pewter Caribou mounted on a flat, hammered cork head, to the bottle bag and box, it is clearly a direct rip off of the Blantons packaging.  Wither you find this an off putting encroachment, or an affectionate emulation of style, there is no denying the ""stolen"" characteristic of the display choice, not that the BT-Saz owned entities would care or have a say in the matter.  At least the bottles are square-ish, with pleasing round corners rather than the 8 sided ""crystal ball"" style bottles we are used to with the top notch bourbon.  The license style hologram stickers are a nice touch as well that carries over to the neck band.  Ok bottling asthetics aside, as we know, it's really whats inside that counts. 
                  
                  On the nose this is a spicy dram, a reminder of some other northern border offerings come to mind.  Not much beyond some bold rye spice to be found though. 
                  
                  The liquid defers an oily residue on the insides of my mini goblet and seems to retain a coating on the sides. 
                  With all respect to Derek, that reported ""burst"" of flavor seems to me nothing more than the spice we detected earlier.  These differences could be explained from the single barrel nature of this offering.  Letting the whiskey breath and open a bit with a few drops of water makes only a small difference as the rye spice continues to stand out.  Certianly some small variants of sweetness in caramels and dank sugars but these are mostly over powered on the palate by the afore mentioned spice of most certianly rye origin.   For a single barrel Canadian product this is not entirely unpredicted, nor is it unpleasent, however the barrel finish never really seems to materialize.  Perhaps judged verse the strict whiskey classes this would stand up but as a  bourbon aficionado there is less here in the wood finish and complexity in flavors to take  away.  
                  
                  The finish is perhaps warmer than an 80 proofer would typically yield and the lingering spices carry forward.   All and all not a bad effort, an enjoyable high rye drink that imparts little else but has nothing to complain about either.   A very decent drink but just not a dram that goes on the ""must try"" list. 
                  
                  Perhaps the undoing of the Caribou will be the massive expectations some will derive from the packaging that shouts ""Blantons"" but whose contents are less than the very top notch product that is implied. This may be a satisfying drink but under no circumstances would you trade a bottle of Blantons for it."

4.0,"I usually find Canadian whisky a little on the sweet side for my taste. Thought I would try this since most reviews rated it pretty high and I would get a cool bottle topper in the process. I was happily surprised when I took a sip of this! Definitely more wood on the nose and palette than most Canadian varieties, especially on the back end. with caramel and just a hint of maple that really smooths this one out."

4.0,Very smooth very aromatic on the nose. Very good for the price point.
3.0,3-21-17.   3.9.  Very good.   Smooth but great body
1.0,"A bit of mustiness initially hits you on the nose, with hints of honey and walnuts following. Surprising. Unfortunately, the nose is the best thing about this whiskey. Very smooth on the tongue, muted, almost tasteless at first. Then... nothing. A burst of flavor never comes. Slight bitterness develops after a while. The finish is short and dry, the warmth (or lack of) is not surprising for a minimum proof whiskey. Will try it again later, maybe it'll open up with time. 3/22/17
Fourth time trying this, it's improved ever so slightly, but still not something I'll reach for. Given the good reviews I've seen elsewhere, I'll chalk this up to a bad barrel, and just my own personal palate idiosynchracies. 4/20/17"

3.0,"A solid starter whisky. This whisky can hold its own vs most. Definitely above a mixer grade. Taste is relatively smooth, slightly fruity finish with a clean aftertaste. The bottle and presentation is the nicer end but at a price point that makes me question it's overall value.  Not on top of my favorite choice around the $50 price point. I give it 86 points out of 100."

Taste: tastes totally different then what I was expecting from the smell. I tasted hints of chocolate with a lot of sweet fruits like orange and even maraschino cherries. 

A little hesitant to buy it, because I didn’t know much about Canadian whisky. However I really enjoyed it. Easy to sip, with a lot of unique flavors."

3.5,Poured this earlier as I thought it perfect to go with the @Zslug fantasy hockey league draft.
2.0,"A generous sample courtesy of bourbonjosh24.  

Nose: A little unpleasant.  Acetone, vague grain notes, yeasty background notes, lemon peel, light sugars, light vanilla, just a little bit of oak.  Not particularly complex or interesting up front.  As I get more in to it I get just a hint of peach or apricot.

Flavor: Sweet, vanilla, oak, and not much else.

Finish: Pretty short with a little bit of wood.  Just a little drying with some spice.

Well...it's not bad.  Kind of bland but a background acetone note the whole way through was a little off putting.  Just not much substance."

Caramel & chocolate dominate for me, wiyh a quick smooth finish that doesn't last at all. If I could stomach the sweetness, I could drink this all day long."

4.25,Novi Party store pick.
3.5,"Neat. Gallenstein #1. Neck pour.  Very similar to Blanton’s on the nose.  Vanilla, charred caramel, baking spices, honey graham cracker.

Thicker than expected for being 80 proof.  It’s rock candy sugar on the tongue.  Vanilla frosting with a slight hint of the charred caramel.  That honey graham cracker comes through more on subsequent sips.  Odd after taste though.  There is this musty note that lingers very slightly on the legs that throws me off.

All in all, this is what I expected.  It’s a solid, light sweet treat.  A good intro whiskey.  Hard to say it was worth the $50 beyond the novelty of the beautiful stopper."
2.25,null
3.75,"Neat.  Opened a few months.  Gallenstein pick. A bit different than I remember.  Getting more on the nose than I recall last time.  Light cedar and vanilla.  Little apple.  Hint of graham cracker.  Hint of cinnamon.

It’s light but also oily, gives it an unexpected thickness.  Vanilla reigns supreme.  Hint of mint and maybe apple but it’s just a creamy vanilla through and through.  Bit dry on the finish with a hint of that cedar.  On subsequent sips that mint becomes more dominant.

I like this more than the last time I tried it.  This is a beginners whiskey.  Give this to a newbie, let them get used to the low proof and see if they can pick out the vanilla.  I’ll never buy this again but I must admit that it got better beyond the neck pour.  If I did buy it again, it would be as a gift to a novice whiskey drinker."
