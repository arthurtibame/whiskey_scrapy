4.0,"aroma: cinnamon, cherry, little oak, little brown sugar
flavor: cinnamon, juicy fruit gum, hints of ripened stone fruit, mint and green tea
overall: takes a bit to open up in the glass but is pretty complex and if not your typical bourbon profile. really enjoyed it"
4.5,Pecan pie
3.75,"You can really taste and smell the high rye mashbill. Anise and clove on the nose, very sweet. Drinks a bit hot, but a great finish."

P: Liquid banana bread. Creamy mouth feel with pops of nutmeg and spice 
F: Medium-short with the continuation of the baking spice"
4.25,Really unique taste that reminds me a bit of Mic Drop (which as both MGP would make sense?). Has a spiciness like a rye

4.0,"Taste:  2 oz. Neat in Glen Cairn. Then 3 drops of water.

Appearance:  reddish amber hue, with slow running, thinner to medium legs.

Nose:  Vanilla is front and center with some fresh woodshop, and ethanol that dissipates to reveal warm rye bread with a hint of caraway  seed.

Palate:  Brown butter, brown sugar come in after a pop of heat hits you.  This is a spicy beast that is rough around the edges and is unabashedly in your face.  There is a bit of bitterness and that is where I detect a flaw, albeit minor, and for what this is, might even add to its character.

Finish:  Medium finish, a bit dry with notes of wood followed by butterscotch.  It is good finish, not great finish.  There is a bit of smokiness too, almost like a bbq smoke.

Overall:  Shout out to my friends in Arizona Whiskey Community for recommending this as this is a good one.  If you are looking for a polished edges whiskey.....not this.  BUT if you are not against embracing what I call a ""man man's whiskey,"" this is it. It is strong, upfront, flavorful, and in your face.  For it's rougher edges....which may have to do with aging or lack thereof, it is a fine example of mgp high rye bourbon whiskey.  I am often used to recommending to those who haven't experienced rye to try a rye that drinks like a bourbon (51% rye, barely legal rye) first and then ease into the category.  This is the other way around....a bourbon that drinks like a rye so dive in! Definitely would recommend this one."
