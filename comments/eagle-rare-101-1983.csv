The nose starts with cherry cola, oak, sawdust, leather, cooked brown sugar and caramel. The palate fills the mouth softly with a perfect mix of what was found on the palate, all coming together in one wave of flavor. No one element stands out more than the other, but cinnamon and a touch of pepper do come out at the end. The finish is long and oaky with the palate subsiding and leaving the cinnamon and pepper to come together with the oak as it lasts and lasts. Definitely different from other early 1980s bottlings."
