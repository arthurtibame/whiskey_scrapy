High West Distillery 
Campfire 🔥 Barrel Select 2019
Aged in Ruby Port barrels for 1yr 9 months 

Mash: blend of Scotch,  Bourbon, and Rye

ABV: 48.6%

Taste Note:

Front:
Maple bourbon BBQ sauce, grilled peaches and Dr. Pepper. It’s like your starting a grill session outside by the seas dock. Sea 🌊 spray

Front:
Sand wood, pepper jerky, spicy Licorice but these a buzz zing that lingers for days that I swear it’s a smoke blood orange zest 

Back/Finish:
This is were the the smoke blood orange zest continues with a white chocolate. A floral note that ends slowly with a sweet somky continues.

I rate this a 97 and one of my top Campfires Select I love. So complex I might to return to this again. The price point at 80 is prefect and I buy this all day. 

Cheers High West for this magnificent blend and sweet smoky goodness and go 9ers!"
