3.0,"Very sweet with a mild vanilla and spice taste. Would probably taste a lot better if it were aged longer. Definitely tasted better on the rocks and the wife enjoyed very chilled. I don’t I will purchase again. 
Too bad, as I loved the concept of it being owned and ran by veterans."

3.0,Hints of vanilla and caramel. Not a pricey whiskey but good for a Monday evening.
2.0,Terrible. On course for the worst bourbon I’ve had
