4.25,"I’ve really enjoyed the limited edition whiskies from Canada in the last couple of years and this one was no exception. It’s creamy nose leans more towards bourbon than rye, but the taste is firmly in keeping with the mash bill: black pepper mixed with orange syrup and a hint of dairy. The spices linger, dancing on the tongue. A very good example of what Livermore is capable of producing and excellent value if you can find it."

5.0,"Absolutely exquisite. You cannot go wrong grabbing a bottle of this if you're able to still find it. No young heat, just silky sipping. The only thing I can compare it to is Wiser's 35 Year which is crazy."

5.0,"You had me at ""Hello"". Maybe I had read too much, or was in the perfect mood, but right from the start I enjoyed this bottle. The nose had oak, with maple sugar, red apples, and some allspice. The palate added a buttery quality turning the sweetness into baked brown sugar with cooked darker fruits and cinnamon. The finish was warm, long and certainly brought out more wood and spice. It was drying and balanced the sweet beginning of the whisky. This certainly has a strong influence from Rye, so consider that character if you are looking to buy."
4.0,"What better whisky than this to celebrate a successful PhD defense? Purchased and bunkered last year, now I *finally* get to crack it. And it's a lovely little whisky, although the other user below is correct in noting that it is very similar in character to the (sadly now discontinued) Wiser's Legacy. Big fan of the Wiser's decanter-style bottle. Nose is dill, clove, caraway seed, vanilla, slight burnt rubber (not in a bad way), some wood-smoke and a caramel sweetness. Taste is soft--milder than the nose had me believing--beginning with a caramel/vanilla sweetness and building to some sharp spice, some fresh wood (cedar?), black pepper, and brining spices (again, clove, dill, caraway). Some citrus pith, ginger, cinnamon, mint. A bit thinner than I'd like, with a finish that errs toward dry and lumbery. A very respectable whisky, passing with minor revisions."
5.0,"This is whiskey that brings a smile to my face.
It is both well-rounded and flavorful. It equals or surpasses any single malt I've tried. I hope Dr. Don has an equally impressive replacement when it's gone."

4.0,"I’ll start of by saying J.P. Wiser’s Dissertation is not for everyone. While there is so much to love about it, one has to really concentrate to enjoy the nuances it has to offer. If you don’t have time for that, move on to something with more instantaneous payoff.

The nose is interesting to say the least. It’s woody, musty and a bit bitter, showcasing maple, bright ambers, burnt sugars with a touch of vanilla, displayed almost as a novelty. Take your time. These elements do not explode. They exists as minor details for the experience. Finding them is like picking up an old object in a room and exploring each crevice and dusty mark. They’re a testimony of a long past history.

This dram has a medium mouthfeel with hearty warmth, staying for a good while. It’s dry, hitting on the top of the palate rather than concentrating on the tongue. 

The finish is smooth with a nice thickness to it. Similar to the nose, it’s unique, ending with leathery dry goods, old ropes and straps.

If I had to sum all these things up in one word, I’d say J.P. Wiser’s Dissertation is “transportive.” It reminders me of a navigator thoughtfully mapping out a journey. I don’t always want this feeling in a whisky, as the experience can be quite intense. In certain circumstances however, that connectedness to an ideal, the past, a way of life I’ve never known, it’s all I want.
