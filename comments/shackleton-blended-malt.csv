3.0,I can’t describe this better than @cascode. See his review he nailed it. The nose is great. Very complex orchard fruits and spice. Palate is good not great. Too thin and doesn’t live up to the nose.
4.0,"Smooth, balanced. Not overly charismatic."

3.5,"Nose: A bright, yeasty, cereal nose with notes of green apple, lemon essence, melon, brown sugar, and very faint ginger. There's a micro whiff of smoke, but it's reserved and dainty (you notice it more on the dry glass).
        
Palate: The arrival is lightly sweet and brisk with flavours of melon, white grapes, honey and green apple. A lot of gristy cereal flavours appear as it develops, followed by tastes of light baked goods (brioche, arrowroot biscuits, panettone) and mild ginger spice. The texture is pleasant and lifting, but a little watery, and rather like the texture of a blended scotch.
        
Finish: Short. Light sweet fruit and weak black Darjeeling tea that turns slightly sour, but then back to sweet at the very end.
        
This is a pleasant and easy to drink malt blend with some character but it lacks that certain spark that distinguishes a great whisky.  The lightness of body is enjoyable, but very similar to that of a blended scotch.
        
I think the producers sold themselves short and made too many compromises. This should have been composed with a little more personality and then blended with a really fine mature grain whisky, or even just simply bottled at 46 or 48%. Either approach would have resulted in something more interesting (there were two previous Mackinlay's Shackleton expressions which were released at 47.3% - they were considerably more expensive, but very good). 

I did notice that after being open for a couple of weeks, and with the level down to about 3/4, the whisky had oxidized very gracefully and gained some heft and complexity.  I'd almost recommend opening this, decanting it to oxygenate, re-bottling it and waiting a fortnight before starting to taste. It definitely changes a good deal over time, and for the better.
        
At the asking price it just represents value for money, being competitive against similarly priced malt blends.  It has more going on than either Naked Grouse or Monkey Shoulder, but it is but 30% more expensive. Compass Box or the Douglas Laing blends are a better comparison.

A few cents from every sale goes to the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust.

1.75,"Apple, caramel, vanilla and a bit of smoke in the nose.  Smooth dram all the way to the medium to long finish.  Smoke and peat linger. 

I tried this blind.  I am not a fan of peaty scotch so this is not one I would buy.  However, it tasted like a single malt to me.  I was very surprised to find out this was a blend.  Much more complex than Monkey Shoulder and other blends in the"

2.5,"Thanks to @GeologyJack for the generous pour!  I bought this along with me to Denver this week, figured it’ll give me some company working late nights in the hotel.  And honestly...I hate the overpriced subpar hotel drinks.  Case and point: they charged me $15 for a pour of Yellow Tail Shiraz, which one can buy a full bottle for $10-15!  Anyway, this is far better than anything the hotel normally has on deck.  We have no idea of knowing how close this is to the original Shackleton whiskies they found deep in the Antarctic, but marketing bullshit aside, it’s a decent pour.  Nothing complex and thought provoking, but a good enough bottle to have with friends.  It offers a bread-y, light lemony flavor, with just enough depth to keep you interested.  I’d compare this to a Compass Box Great King St Artist blend.  Not sure of the price, but I’d say I’d be a buyer if it’s in the $40 range.  Anything more, I can do better with Compass Box GKS, or even better with a JW Green."

3.0,"I would get it again. Good blend. Apple sweetness to the nose, vanilla, some lemony elements, sour apple, along with a hint of peat smoke. More briny, seaweed, salty, smoky in the mouth, conquered by oak on the finish. Some nuttiness also present in the back, walnut. Nose much different then the mouth, love when that happens."
3.5,low peat and smoke. nose really smells of alcohol.
2.5,"This is a very WEAK blend as far as I taste. There is nothing BAD about it, BUT, there is nothing GOOD about it either. I have never tasted anything so EXACTLY middle of the spectrum as this one. I will us it to blend with something else and hope for the best.
 EXPENSIVE for such  a mediocre blend."
3.0,"Bought this for the story, grew up hearing it from my Dad. It’s a clean drinking blend, easy and tasty, pour neat. A previous taster mentioned it get better once the bottle is opened and I certainly agree. Nose is bananas but doesn’t carry on to the taste. To me it’s almost an easier JW Black. When none scotch friends visit this is what I serve. It may have not have blown me away but it’s a solid buy and a great bottle for conversation. I think I’m on my third bottle now and the consistency is appreciated. I’ll be keeping one on the shelf."
3.0,For $30 I found the taste acceptable.  A nice soft Smokey taste.

3.0,"From the nose you get most likely ex bourbon notes of delicious sugary notes humming in the background. While most likely an American oak of wood spice, bitterness are right in front of you. Also smoky and little peaty notes zipping in and out.
If you let the drink sit there for couple of mins, you will discover they switches places.

Once you take a sip, banana, creme brulee started to show up then fade away as wood species took over with a medium finish."
3.5,"I purchased it out of curiosity--of course I have no real idea of how closely it simulates the flavor of the whisky on Shackleton's expedition. Overall, I would say this is a rather pleasant Scotch. There is a good nose of malt, orchard fruit, and medium peat. In the mouth those flavors come through, the mouth feel is rather thin. If you can find it for $30 or less, I would say it is worth a try."

3.25,"A strange attempt to recreate a malt whisky from 1907. Why, I don't know. It doesn't work. This is a rather pricy blend of rough, young, sharp-edged malt whiskies that need far more time to mature than they were given, and the asking price is far too high considering for the same money you can get a Glenmorangie 10 or Glenfiddich 12. Throw this back in a barrel for a few more years and you might have something. But as it is now, you have the whisky equivalent of a tourist trap."

3.0,Faint peat & pear smell but more of honey & vanilla. Initial flavors of banana & mild pear followed by apple and maybe some light smokiness.  Spicy warmth on tongue and throat that lingers. At the end it smelled more like honey & pears...really good.  A drink that would grow on one I believe; I may need to get a bottle and test that theory!

2.0,"Bought it for the history behind the bottle..nose is cherry and damp wood. Peaty and some fruit taste, lighter finish. Not a scotch guy and not a peat guy but nice addition to the collection and something cool to talk about."
3.0,"It’s hard not to be taken in by the story of this whisky.  I know it’s all about the marketing, but it’s a nice little conceit to think you’re drinking something with a similar flavour profile to one that Shackleton himself may have enjoyed.  Almost definitely a load of bollocks, but still fun!

The first taste is quite alcohol heavy.  It then mellows into a caramel and citrus sweetness.  The finish is long, sharp and honeyed, with a light buttery aftertaste.  It’s not a refined whisky, but there are a few layers of flavour and it’s certainly an easy dram to drink.

Overall, it’s not a bad dram, but the story is definitely more interesting than the whisky."

2.0,"First tasting notes so be gentle. Nose is basically strong alcohol, even after drinking for a while I could not detect anything else it's so strong. Luckily the taste is not as bad. Initially it's all peat and smoke, but with a drop of water and half way down the glass it does smooth out and calm down to the point where caramelised apples, honey and lots of spice put up a good fight. Not a bad whiskey (if such a thing exists), but probably one to try, reflect on its story, and move on. It's possible I might return to it, but I may be some time."
