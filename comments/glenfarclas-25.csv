5.0,"It's dessert time with a dram of this one. Some of the most beautiful, languid legs I've seen in a whisky. The nose is full of vanilla, rum-soaked dried fruit, and old hardwoods. On the palate, an initial burst of sweetness - very reminiscent of an Italian cream cake or tres leches cake. Milky, caramely notes with some honey and fruit. These pass by and close with lingering notes of mint, pipe tobacco, and old hardwood; having grown up in Texas, it reminds me of good, dry hickory for the smoker. Maybe not my everyday go-to (cheap this one isn't), but a really lovely treat."

5.0,Great dram in place of dessert - sweet and just enough smoke to be interesting. Very smooth. The price point for the age and complexity is excellent and pushes this up from 4.5 to 5 stars in my book.
4.0,"After a disastrous first round of golf in 2017 I need something to lift my spirits and get that sour taste out of my mouth.  Perfect time for a well-aged single malt.  I believe my good friend, Paul M, has supplied me with just the juice to do the job:  Glenfarclas 25.  Thanks again Paul, for the very generous sample.

I've had a few GFs to this point, but nothing this old.  Based on my previous samplings I can't really say I'm a big fan of this distillery, but they do put all their finer offerings well into the hands of the scotch ""everyman"" with lower costs for finely aged scotch.  I believe a bottle of this 25 year old can be had for just a tad over $150.  Good luck finding another whisky this old for that price.

It's a beautiful golden yellow in the taster but doesn't really offer up much leg action as it's a bit oily and just clings to the sides when it's spun.  The aroma was mostly American oak spice, cinnamon with a well-rounded roasted nut aroma.  I've let it set almost 30 minutes and I do get vanilla and toffee as well.  Nice.

The palate isn't very complex- oak spice and vanilla that washes away with even more wood spice and pepper.  The finish is long and a bit bitter.  It's significantly smoother than the 10 year old I recently reviewed, but that has to be expected given the extra time in the cask.  I even poured an ounce of the 10 year old just for a reference point here.

Overall, Glenfarclas has never been considered an exciting dram IMO and the tradition continues with the 25 year old.  It has really benefitted from the extra time, but I think they need to use better quality casks or work with their stills to tweak the flavor profile.  And there's the rub-  better casks and better still design would also erase the price point and take them back to the drawing board, which at this point can't be on their radar.  They are obviously perfectly fine offering well priced single malt to the masses.  Cheers to them for that and cheers to everyone that gets to taste their hard work without breaking the bank."

The alcohol is more pronounced than you'd expect. There's lots of flavors here but everything is a tad too quiet. Though the texture is pretty luxurious .

You could certainly spend a few evenings sifting through this."

Upon opening it had a lovely viscosity and mild sherry flavour profile. It's def not the sherry bomb profile I love and after a few months open it's definitely faded and got more bitter. Despite the fact it's cheap for a 25 year  I'd much prefer a dram of Glendronach 15 Revival, 18 or 21 over this or even the Benromach 10 or Oban 14 I just had along side this and at $130USD I think I'm rating this down to a 3"

4.0,"This Speyside single malt comes in at 43% ABV, is non chill filtered and a natural color of amber honey. 

The nose is bursting with wonderful mixed nuts. Walnuts, Brazil nuts, and maybe some almonds. Dates and raisins with some lightly sherried dried fruits. Sherried oak and honey. I took my time nosing this whisky, about an hour before I finished. After about 30 minutes I got a big blast of cinnamon on a deep inhale. About 15 minutes after that a nice note of fresh coffee showed up but quickly vanished. Once that was gone I got a brief note of sandalwood incense. Truly a beautiful nosing whisky if you have the patience to allow it to develop. If I could create a cologne that smelled like this I would wear it every day. 

There is a surprisingly spicy arrival on the palate. Just the right amount of spice to be really enjoyable and not overpowering. Nuts, sherry, cinnamon and oak. Full bodied and intense. The tasting notes claim it is smoky, but I did not get any smoke. Some very light smoke would have been nice though. 

The mouthfeel is lightly oily at first but becomes quite dry. The finish is medium long to long, very dry with nuts and bitter dark chocolate. The finish was a little too bitter for my liking and really ended things on a down note. It took away from the great experience up until that point. 

Overall I really loved this single malt, despite the bitter finish. Very mature and refined. Glenfarclas is a great family owned and independent distillery. They spend very little on marketing and can keep costs down. I paid $160 for this 750ml bottle. That's pretty damn good for a 25 YO.  I would have easily given this a 4.75 for its fabulous nose and great palate and value, but the finish really hurt the score and I decided to give it a 4.25. If you have the means, buy a bottle. I look forward to trying more from the Glenfarclas range in the future. Cheers"

5.0,"Thanks to my Motorcity Motown buddy Paul, I got to sample this tonight.  It’s interesting going through the series of my SDT samples...going through each one but saving the ones I know are really good for the end.  It’s like back as kids building a Lego set.  You put brick over brick, and as you’re finally getting closer to making that Millennium Falcon, you can just feel the anticipation; and then finally when that last brick is in, you really marvel at how well it turned out.  So it was with these series of 24 or so samples as part of our little trading team.  Over the 3 months, you’re waiting and anticipating those Big 3 waiting in the end of the lineup ( in this case, it was HP25 taking the top billing, followed by this Glenfarclas, and finally a Hibiki 21 in 3rd spot).  This didn’t disappoint.  Far from it.  And far from it being a daily dram.  More of a special occasion.   As soon as I opened the sample bottle cap, I got a whiff of dried fruits and nuts.  Like dates, raisins, and that caramel sauce they put on a flan.  More of the same on the palette.  Not complex, but just solid.  Really well made.  Thanks Paul!   One final sample to go in our tour...the HP25. If this was the HP’s opening act, it’s a solid performance."

4.0,"Glenfarclas has quickly became a personal favorite after leanring this is a private distillary and deciding to try their products. I enjoyed the 12 so much I wanted to find a older age statement (at a very fair price) and so here we are. 
    
    I get a marshmellowy creme brulee on the nose with a vanilla and orange hint. You get the feeling this would go great after a savory meal. Palate is a whirlwind of fruits from different seasons. Orange, apple, candied cherry with a woodsy flavor I would think of around Chrstmas time.
    
    While this is a fun (and affordable!) drinker with an old age statement I do not think I would stock on a regular basis. Regarldess of a great deal on age I need to fall in love with a whisky for the $150+ pricepoint. I really enjoy haveing friends try it as an older speyside example but I'll stick to the 12 next time i'm hunting for a Glenfarclas.

Taste - A touch sour, some wood funk, vanilla.  Spices on the end.  

Finish - here the sherry comes out leaving a nice sherry finish and some good spices.  

This is a great deal when the question is ""oldest whisky for the price"" but is it a deal at 150 dollars?  On that note I have to say overwhelmingly no.  This just isn't very good.

4.75,"Glenfarclas tasting night at The Oak Barrel, Sydney, 4 July 2019. Whisky #4

Nose: Sherry, dark honey, orange marmalade, espresso, dried fruits (figs, dates, apricots, apples, raisins), herbal notes, powdered ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, marzipan and walnut loaf. An uplifting aroma of old, but healthy, oak cask. This nose is very reminiscent of a dunnage warehouse. There are slight aromas of mint and  pipe tobacco in the background that only emerge over time.

Palate: The arrival is immediately captivating – velvety smooth with no intrusive spirity presence, it’s an enfolding cashmere blanket of sherried malt enlivened by a light touch of gentle spice. As it develops you notice the dark fruitcake heart of the palate. Mixed fruit and nuts, cherries, dark chocolate, coffee and manuka honey. Oak tannins provide an authoritative foundation with warm baking spices in abundance but there are no harsh, sharp or hot notes. The signature Glenfarclas spicy ginger is much mellower here. The texture is rich but firm, and overall the palate is precisely poised between sweet and dry.

Finish: Medium/long. Clean dark fruitcake flavours fade into inky blackness leaving a delicate walnut and bittersweet dark chocolate aftertaste.

This whisky has many of the profile characteristics that are found in younger Glenfarclas expressions but nothing here is loud or artless. There is a relaxed refinement about the profile and great complexity, so intricate and subtle that at first introduction the whisky might seem simple. It's all about the interplay of bold aromas and flavours that have modulated and interacted over time to create a mature whole.

Give this whisky 20-30 minutes to compose itself in the glass before tasting and don't hurry the experience. It may seem a little understated at first but there is a great deal to discover if you are patient and allow it to unfold at its own pace. If this were a painting it would be a Constable landscape.

Note: The Distiller notes on this site say that this whisky is matured in a combination of bourbon and sherry casks, but that's not correct. Glenfarclas 25 is, and always has been, 100% oloroso cask matured, using a combination of first-fill and refill.

4.75,"On the nose, the classic Speyside notes of butterscotch and honey come through.  However, there is so much more.  The age gives way to figs, dried apricots, raisins, and a musty cellar quality that is quite warm and inviting.  On the palate, it comes alive with the butterscotch and honey, but all of the aged fruits come through and overpower the classic Speyside notes in such a delightful way.  It reminds you that this whisky is a quarter-century old.  The MOST surprising part of this Scotch is the finish.  It just keeps going...and going...and going.  Not only does it go on and on, but new flavors reveal themselves over that time.  For me, the sherry notes are the most prominent on the finish and I love it.  My favorite part of this whisky? The price.  I am willing to bet money that this is the only reputable Scottish distillery that offers a 25 year old expression for less than $500.  I never thought I'd ever be casually sipping a 25 year old Scotch in the comforts of my own home.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a special occasion whisky who wants to show off a Scotch with the big ""25"" on the label and doesn't want to break the bank."
4.5,"I was having a tasting event with some friends at home and one of the brought this Glenfarclas 25. Even if it is a highland malt it sure feels like an speysider.

Bottled at 43%abv.

On the nose a fresh clean red apple note. Have you ever bite and apple and wait 10 minutes and you notice how the apple gets ""old"" because of the bite? The yellow inside turns brownish? Well, that brownish old red apple aroma is the one this glenfarclas have. It is exactly the apple ""motts"" juice aroma. After a while some red fruits appear and maybe sherry. Clean aroma, very likeable not complex at all.

On the palate is a good dram. Cinnamon, oak, red apples. Not much going on but truly pleasant. Finish is eternal with a clove/ginger note. 

Overall for a 25yo it could be better but it is a good dram and it is cheap (around 150), my score for it is 93 over 100."

4.0,"Nose - Sherry/ Complex/ Would seem to be a scotch of significance... even if you did not know what you were drinking this dram shines through
Palate - Sherry/ refined / complex/ well done scotch - holds its own against much more expensive bottles.
Finish - starts off really nice// but i am met early on with something possibly a mild bitterness that disrupts the harmony and then it dissipates/  definitely a long pleasant finish."

2.5,"All scotch on the nose. Very straightforward.
Pleasant entry, a little thin in the middle, then builds up somewhat at the back, finished by a nice burn. Overall, I’d say it’s quintessential scotch."

3.75,"Very fruity nose, mostly banana. Quit burning though."
4.5,"Nose: more subtle, quieter, still a bit tropical, banana and sultana
Body: less delicate and very firm, smooth with underlying spice, dry
Palalte: sultana, tropical fruit, hints of cinnamon, oak and wood, spice, brown sugar
Finish: long and woody but not sharp, good mouth cost but not thick, super long 

Punchier than the 21"
4.0,"Nose: Can see the menthol from MoM for sure, unripe apple and way more of the glenfarclas grassy note than I got on the 15 or 21. Sherry notes are all there, with some rubber, unripe pear. Maybe some licorice-y cola notes, too. Bitter chocolate. Savory edge.

Palate: funkier than all the others in the core range, nutty sherry notes at the front with syrup in the background - not over rich, balanced with herbal, minty, grassy notes. Maybe some plum. Dark chocolate and coffee. Completely agree with gingerbread from MoM. Ashy smoke in comparison with the 21.

Finish: must, chocolate, cream, grass, sherry nuttiness.

Funkiest of the core range that I’ve tried, maybe more immediately interesting with the 21 but not necessarily better. Fantastic subtle sherried whisky with a herbal edge."
