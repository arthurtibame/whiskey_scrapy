5.0,"From the distiller: ""Our flagship product is made from 100% Malted barley in the Scotch whisky style. This American whiskey is aged over 7 months in 5 gallon oak barrels. Spotlighting the barley grown and malted in the Pacific Northwest, this whiskey was built for a truly unique regional flavor. Oregon distilled and bottled, we take care to ensure the quality of ingredients to produce a flavor profile that defines Oregon whiskies.

Proofed at 92 (46% alcohol by volume) this aged whiskey presents a balance between grassy, freshly cut wood and richer carob and anise notes on the back. With a hint of asphalt over taken by caramel, this whiskey maintains a subtle complexity sure to please the Scotch drinker’s palate."""
