4.5,"This is not tasteless colored water. This is good old time whisky. Dark fruits, apricots, raisins and honey in taste.
This whisky makes me happy."

2.5,"Ok, but really not to my taste. Brobably *** to most people"
4.0,"My final review on the ""Ballantine's Single Malt series"" is the home of Ballantine's itself: Glenburgie. Is in this distillery that Pernod Ricard blenders make the popular Ballantine's, and they have of course their own single malt. This time is another 15yo expression. The Distillery is well known for Geese who guard the whole place, and they tend to attack strangers.

Bottled at 40%abv.

On the nose: another super speysider. Toffee, Vanilla, Banana, Caramel, Honey, 
Sider.

On the palate, honey and cereal. Like the honey Corn Flakes for breakfast. Aftertaste has a dry grassy note, with more honey. 

Overall this is a very nice dram, specially if you are a honey lover. 83 over 100."
