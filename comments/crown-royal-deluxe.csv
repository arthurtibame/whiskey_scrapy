4.0,"Had a couple glasses of Crown with Dad to celebrate retirement. Bought in 1979 when he started Med school. 7 years aged at the time. Bottled in 1972. Aged in bottle since. Opened and Drank in March 2018. 56 years old. Very smooth. No bite. Quite noticeably smoother than regular crown, and more so than I was expecting."

3.0,"Nose: It's sweet and smooth straight off the bat. There is vanilla and coconut and the longer I smell it, toasted marshmallow comes to the front.

Taste: Like the Canadians who made her, she's friendly. Vanilla, honey, and graham crackers predominate with some lemongrass making a subtle appearance. The finish is smooth though not very exciting.

Opinion: For those who aren't a fan of drinking whiskey neat, the classic Crown&Coke is a great option here. However, this whisky is so smooth and friendly it can easily be drank neat even by the novice. This is great beginner whisky and also one that experienced drinkers can come to for a smooth not complicated dram. Cheers!"

Body- There is a little bit of that rye pickle brine here and a lot of sweetness. The 80 proof seems really light in body after what I have been drinking lately.
Finish- Not really much there just bread and butter pickles. Well I don’t like bread and butter pickles. 

One, I have not had any Canadian whiskies that I get excited about.

Finish is short. It is very smooth and easy to drink. I have poured this into my infinity bottle whenever I need to rest the flavor profile and it does that well. Other than that, only the parents ever drink it. I certainly will not be joining them! Cheers all."

Overall, surprised by how smooth this is and how the sweetness doesn’t overpower the taste."

I picked up maple and vanilla sweetness but it just wasn’t that notable, not much of a finish as it fades quickly. Others have stated it is a good mixer and they are probably right, drinking it neat is rather blasé."

3.25,"Noticeable presence of oil content that leaves a cinnamon spice aftertaste that stays on the tongue, extremely smooth throughout with a warming effect instead of a mouth burn and a sweet lingering note as a goodbye.

With a straw of mountain spring water it loses all that sweetness from before and becomes an allspice concoction that is just short of Maker's Mark on the scale, still maintains all the smoothness from before.

Mixed with some Pepsi in a highball (felt appropriate) it becomes very mellow but still has enough of a presence to not be forgotten, changes the Pepsi to be more allspice in nature just like with the mountain spring water, which is surprising as Pepsi is considered the sweetest of colas by many."

More spicy oak and grape juice on the palate, but behind a rich layer of vanilla. The finish is long with almonds and a few bitter notes at the end.

This whiskey is not something I would seek out to drink straight. For best results, mix with cranberry juice."

Dec. 4:

Nose is minimal, but I get mild caramel.

Body is yeasty. Decent burn.

Finish has brine and black pepper.

Very basic whisky, but it’s fine. I’m actually quite impressed with this distiller in general based on some of their other offerings. Makes me feel like a bit of a tool, but I’m okay with Crown.

I don’t know if I actually have 27 more new whiskeys lined up, so if you’re reading this and there’s something readily available out there you’d like me to enjoy/suffer through this holiday season, leave it in the comments."

3.5,"Coming back to this for the first time after starting my journey into understanding whiskey gave me a newfound appreciation for Crown. Rather than hate this as something cheap and universally available, I found this to be pleasant but simple.

I recall hating this much more when I was younger and would take shots of it at a bar.  However, tonight, I discovered a 2/3 empty bottle of Crown Royal in the back of my cooking cabinet, and curiosity got the better of me.

Coming from drinking cask strength bourbons on a regular basis, this had no burn whatsoever. Exceptionally smooth, with a juicy burst of white grape and pinot grigio. A discernible rye spice on the finish that surprised me.  Reminiscent of juicier, watered down, MGP Rye. 

I rarely drink 80 proof whiskey, but tonight's taste piqued my interest enough to have me pull out one of the few in my collection: standard, 4-year, Templeton Rye. Surprisingly, the crown had noticeable similarities, though obviously less spicy. 

I do wonder if regular crown tastes like this, or if sitting 2/3 full for years in the back of a cabinet helped It improve"

Crown and coke was a goto for me at parties. Now that I'm more experienced and my palate is a bit more nuanced, I thought I'd get a sample of CR Deluxe and see if I'm still fond of this whiskey

Overall, its smooth with vanilla, mild syrup, and some oak. A bit of citrus on the nose. The taste is a bit weak  with a woody finish that tastes a bit odd. Its so smooth to the point that flavor notes feel watered down. I'd relegate this to a mixer only. 

Not one I'd drink neat, but Crown and Coke still ain't half bad."
4.5,It's super smooth. Canadians really know how to make whiskey.
3.0,"It's not rich, not too spicy, and not full-bodied. It's thin, on the sweet side, and lacks a big bite. Even the finish didn't have any kick. In other words, it's a good light sipper, a whisky that would go well with dessert, or after dinner. 
I'm not sure, but I think that was the plan from the beginning."

2.75,"Smooth and easy to drink. Warm, and sweet with vanilla, caramel and a little fruit. Being Canadian of course it won’t punch you in the palate but it doesn’t need to apologize either for being a nice drink."
2.25,"Enjoying a tour of some of the brands I haven't touched in years for whatever reason.  The journey continues with Crown Royal, this taste coming from a 50ml nip that came complete with a little purple bag.  I love it!

Tasted neat from a glencairn.  The light amber pour has some sheeting and clingly legs after a swirl.  The nose is immediately off-putting with sharp ethanol and traces of acetone right up front.  I'm going to give it a good 10 minutes to sit before evaluating.

After a good, long wait elements of caramel and faint vanilla make an appearance.  Most of the chemical/alcohol notes faded away. What's left is the opposite of complex.

The first sip reveals a sweeter taste with a creamier mouthfeel than the nose advertised.  The upfront is actually pretty good, but the follow through is choppy and disconnected. There's a bitter finish that makes me not want another sip.  

And then comes a rather interesting lemony bit that makes me wonder if I'd taste it again on another sip. 

Wash, rinse, repeat.  Cloying introduction, sour departure.

I'll drink this on the rocks, or mixed, anyplace where this is the best choice I have.  It's not horrible for a fully mainstream, mass market name brand delivered in a plastic bottle.  That does't mean I want it in my cabinet. It is, at it's best. wholly average.

My scale of 1 to 5 places the peak of the bell curve at 2.5.  Most competent, but unremarkable, whiskies will be found between 2 and 3 on this scale. 

Hard pass on buying a bottle."

I have changed because when I was a young lad this was a strong drink but now it is a thin light liquor. For a Canadian whiskey, it is not bad and I do give them credit for a great marketing department it just does not have the flavor or strength of even the most basic Bourbons like Jim Beam white-label or Evan Williams 1783. For the price, if one bottle of CR I could get half a gallon of Evan Williams 1783."

3.0,"Ok, im impressed. I've never expected to  get a nice experience from this whisky. Crown Royal deluxe blended scotch, Canadian most famous spirit, is well balanced, tasty, and elegant. On the nose is creamy with vanilla notes, a little floral or herbal. On the palate, it start very sweet, with caramel, honey and toffee notes, to change into a spicy but gentle sensation. the finish is medium, with a different, mint flavor. Never before have i experienced mint caramel on a whisky. Nice dram"
