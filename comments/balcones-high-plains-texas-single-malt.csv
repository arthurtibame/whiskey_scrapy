5.0,"It’s like smelling summer in the Texas Hill Country... spicy, woody, warming. It’s beautifully rich and full. Like drinking beeswax that’s been warming with baking spices in it. Some lighter notes in the background... zest. Finish is long and rich... the beeswax lingers."

5.0,Rich! Big top notes but really great flavors all over the tongue. Great burn without being overpowering at all. Drink it neat! Hold on and breath it in 💪🏽
3.75,"Dry, dusty, with grain stalks and barnfloors on the nose. The taste infuses these characteristics with a spread of maple and a slight hint of sour tropical fruit. But really, the name does it justice. This is just the prairie in a glass."
4.0,"Got my hands on a bottle of this from a friend that went to the distillery release. Big and bold as can be expected with most of the Balcones releases - some of the traditional house flavors with a bit of lighter fruit. I enjoyed this one, but prefer some of the other single barrels I have tried at Total Wine."
