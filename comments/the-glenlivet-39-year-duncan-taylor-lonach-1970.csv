4.5,"The color is a medium gold, full of oil with a nose that is fruity, with subtle oak, vanilla, straw, sea salt, pineapple and grass. The palate is slightly spicy, with brine, vanilla, oak, leather, some cigar tobacco, all with underlying fruit. The finish is medium long, with the mouth tingling while straw, salt and oak fade gently. Classic Glenlivet flavors."
