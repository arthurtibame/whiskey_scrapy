4.0,"Nose - Sweet buttery creamed corn, creme brulee, butter, buttered roasted corn, did I mention sweet creamy BUTTER?
Taste - Very smooth almost creamy mouthfeel, flavors are very subtle, brown butter, cloves, hint of chocolate, almost like a latte that has a hint of chocolate, or a mocha that has too much steamed milk
Finish - medium long finish, slightly bitter, cinnamon emerges with a gradually warming spicy warmth.

1.0,Mine is from the microbarrled Era. It tastes like glue with a bit of oak. Avoid at all cost.
2.0,"Sweet, rich and definitely honey, along with other rich flavors - molasses, creamed corn, creme brulee, as well as cinnamon. The finish is cinnamon, which I can't stand (similar to Temperance). Young, lacking some complexity.  Lacks typical Caramel, Vanilla of traditional bourbon - maybe its the Northwest influence?  Local, from here in the Seattle area, hence why I ended up trying it. That said, it's different, and because of that its grown on me a bit over time when looking for something different."

4.25,"I tried this at a bar for 11/pour. I ended up finding a bottle and bought one the next day.

Nose has oak, brown sugar, cinnamon, very nice sweet leather, subtle apple and freshly baked bread.

Palate has a light and slightly oily mouthfeel with cinnamon, rye spice, nice leather and oak.

Finish is medium long with spices lingering and some faint brown sugar.

This was nice. I love the spices and leather. I look forward to having this again."

4.0,"Very interesting pour! I get apple cider, caramel, vanilla, barrel notes, and spice with a hint of ethanol on the nose. Overall very pleasant. Drinks a bit young and grainy on the attack, but very oily and thick on the back end. Sweet cinnamon spice and warmth slowly fading to barrel spices and low warm hug. Finish is fantastic. Needs more time in the barrel, but could be amazing with time (oh the potential)."

Very sweet nose with some traditional bourbon notes coming through as well.  Palate is light, easy sipping.  This has a pleasant finish that continues the sweet, fruity profile with some cream.  This is a very easy sipper and a surprising pour out of the PNW state of Washington!  8.0/10"

The taste starts smooth and sweet with a little honey, then hits with that dried fruit flavor and a bitter pecan then finishes with a creme brulee. Seems oily but it doesn't linger on the palate, not a whole lot of flavor left behind just a little vanilla. Overall this is pretty tasty, doesn't seem pot stilled, not a lot of funky flavors that I would expect, just that bitter pecan."

4.5,"Nose is light cherry, caramel and cinnamon. Taste is big cherry notes, oak, then tons of pipe tobacco!"
3.5,"The nose on this Washingtonian whiskey is hot and young, but quite representative of a bourbon profile with burnt brown sugar and oranges steeped in alcohol.  From an emptied, dry glass -- the nose is Lipton iced tea leading to cocoa powder (thanks @BDanner for the hint).  On the palate: cherry, toffee, caramels, and oak.  Light, but still more on the cherry-side than most bourbons.  The age and heat is detected on the mouthfeel as well, and contributes to a finish that is lightly tannic but astringent.  With one teaspoon of water, the dryness is neutered and the whiskey is rendered quite friendly. 

Not bad for a $35 bottle - with a Double Gold under its belt at the 2020 SF World Spirits Competition. But it's not worth the hype, either.  The other night, I followed a dram of this with a dram of a like-priced bourbon, Maker's 46, and the Maker's blew it out of the water in terms of mouthfeel and flavor. Still, this is decent VFM for a bourbon that, while nothing overboard, delivers a quaffable experience.  

As a craft distillery, maybe Woodinville wasn't as zealous, professional, shareable, or purposeful as ones in the South - being bought out by LVMH (the current owners of Glenmorangie and Ardbeg). Or, they might've blown whatever overhead they had in releasing the first batches.  Whatever the reason, I still look forward to older stock in the future to mellow the heat and dryness (and with the new ownership, that may be a rational prospect).

3.5,"Oak, leather, pipe tobacco"
2.25,"Woodinville

*NOSE: Woah! FLORAL! The initial nose is the most floral I've ever encountered. However, though it returns occasionally, it quickly fades to Corn Dust, Lipton Tea, Dry Dusty Oak, and that smell you get when you pop the metal circle out of the tin of Hershey's Unsweetened Cocoa Powder. It's different, but I'm concerned by the dominance of Young Corn. It is interesting how that very strong Floral note comes and goes.
*NEAT: Corn dominates the first sip, and not in a good way. The second sip brings in the Lipton Tea from the nose. Light Vanilla turns the Corn into Creamed Corn. Some Tannic Bitterness creeps in. There is a light tingle on the finish with a mild KY Hug. Oak and a mild Corny Sweetness coats the palate. So far, I'm not a fan.
*SPLASH: Adds Cinnamon to the palate, however it does not pair well with the dominant corn note. That Floral Note from the nose appears on the coating finish. 

*VERDICT: Very disappointing. I knew this was a craft distillery, but the fact that they were purchased by one of the big guys and had won some awards I was hoping for something special. I thought it might have some age on it, but it tastes very young. Maybe I got a bad bottle? Maybe it will improve with some time open? If it does, I'll let you know, but I can't give this any more than 2 1/4."

3.75,"A bit of raw grain on the nose, but it's mostly sweet corn, caramel, and some general spice. It actually smells like it would be a higher proof than it is, but without any burn through the nose. The body is initially a bit disappointing, but that is likely from the lower proof. The barrel flavor is certainly coming through, but without a longer age time, I'm getting more young oak than the traditional longer aged tasting notes, and it makes me curious on what barrel char level was used. There are indeed some dark fruit notes closer to the finish, which definitely make this a unique blend.

This reminds me of my all time favorite craft bourbon (which shall not be named), so it's getting a lot of automatic love from me. I was also very jealous to learn of the other delicious sounding products this distillery produces, since this was the only product I could find.

Overall, I would enjoy coming back to this bourbon probably more often than not to try to break up the less different ones in my collection. Great work!"
