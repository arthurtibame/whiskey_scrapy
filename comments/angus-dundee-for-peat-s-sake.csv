2.0,"A heavy amount of peat on the nose, reminds me of BBQ’s and the smell of clothes after a long weekend camping... with something else just below the smoke which I can’t quite name. 

Sweet cardamum, vanilla, and pepper on the palate gives way to a smokey and a bit bitter of a finish. 

Very good for a blended whiskey at this price point. I wasn’t expecting the peat to be as heavy as some other Islay whiskeys. 

-1 star: After the first day this whiskey has lost more and more of it’s peat smell. It was the best when first opened and doesn’t keep well."
