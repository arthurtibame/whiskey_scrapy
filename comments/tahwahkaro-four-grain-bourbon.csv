3.25,A really good start for this distillery. If you are in to interesting things worth a buy at a bar for sure.
3.5,Has a very unique taste even for a four grain. Tastes like a heavy corn mash bill. It doesn’t have a dynamic nose which is misleading once you taste it... I don’t hate it.
1.5,"I expected more from this. I hear they are doing interesting things, but this edition tasted like burnt medicine to me. Not to my liking, but I’m sure someone will enjoy."
3.0,"a little expensive, but overall a nice find. I look forward to Future releases."

4.0,"Looking in my Glencairn I notice a brown leather hue to this barrel strength bourbon and thin watery legs clinging to the glass walls.

The nose is full and strong. There are notes of cinnamon, Hot Tamales candy, wood and barrel spice, cherry, rich vanilla, bubblegum, and fresh grass.

The palate is rich, almost chewy with notes of caramel, cherry, oak, cinnamon and cardamom, brown sugar, molasses, and black tea.

The finish is hot, long, and cinnamony."
3.0,"It is unique, taste a little similar to Balcones, but doesn’t have the bites. Nutty and burnt charcoal flavor."
