3.25,"Licht rokerig qua geur, maar qua smaak meer rokerig"
2.75,"A while back, I expressed interest in trying some unique Irish whiskies. @LeeEvolved gave me a nice list of Irish whiskies that stray from the norm. On this list were a handful of West Cork bottlings, a distillery I've been seeing more and more but have yet to try. Upon finding this, I decided to buy. It's a very interesting concept (not peated like Connemara but aged in peat-charred casks) and comes in one of the coolest of whiskey bottles I've seen to date.

Nose: Very green and grassy. Some vanilla sweetness. A bit of spearmint. Some rubber; somewhere between tire rubber and the rubber on a turf football field. Cinnamon and black pepper. Hay, wet grass, and tree bark. Citrus notes of orange and grapefruit, along with banana. Faint smoke. Confusing nose, but has grown more cohesive as I've worked through the bottle.

Palate: Vanilla and caramel. More of the grassy, earthy, green notes. Tree bark and hay. Some more spearmint. An interesting cured ham note. Pear, and, instead of apple, I'll go with Mott's apple sauce. More banana and grapefruit. Toffee and malt. Cinnamon, black pepper, and oak. Faintly smoky and ashy. Like with the nose, this has improved significantly since I've opened it. I initially got the rubbery notes from the nose, but am not getting them on this tasting.

Finish: Almost like banana Laffy Taffy. Toffee, vanilla, and honey sweetness. More banana. Spearmint and wintergreen. Cinnamon, black pepper, and oak carry out this surprisingly long finish.

Tough one to score. Admittedly, I came into this tasting ready to beat this one up. I had tried on three separate occasions, including earlier this week, and had not enjoyed it all. Yet, tonight, I had a very different experience with this one. Apart from the rubbery nose, everything just seemed more cohesive, balanced, and interesting.

Not for nothing, this is the first time I've tasted this out of glencairn. I've said this before, but glassware can have a massive impact on your experience with a particular expression, some more than others. For this reason, I only write my reviews when using a glencairn.
I've got a little over half a bottle left to figure this one out. Initially, I had this pegged at 2 stars flat. After having the benefit of time and a tasting from a glencairn, I've settled on a score of 2.75. I will likely update this review at least once. It's certainly a unique whiskey. Maybe not one I'd recommend, but it's growing on me."

3.25,"Light nose, but with a robust flavor that fills the mouth. Tempered it a water back. Peat on the charcoal side, with lasting flavors of smoke."
3.75,PERFECT choice for a blind tasting event!!!!! Tastes like a nice lightly peated scotch smooth very sweet sherry like background briefly before the light Smokey peat shows. Now the debate for an Irish whiskey it is truly unique smooth and tasty 4/5 but for 80$ cad you can get a decent highland park or glenrothes something that tastes a littler better :) so compared to scotch 3.5/5

3.75,"Definitely a LOT of lemon and orange zest on the nose, along with  lush pomegranate and tropical flowers. Rich port wine, dried fruit, and a very distant hint of smoked meat and charcoal from the peat."
null,"""** Disclaimer: This review is what I would consider a “Quick Hit”- meaning I won’t have my usual in-depth notes that I usually like to take. The reason: this sample was poured at Whiskyfest DC on 4/17/18. All of these reviews will not be scored and I am actively looking to try them again at some point to do them more justice.

This is one of the newest releases from my favorite Irish distillery:  West Cork.  They are an independently owned distillery and have a nice selection of single malt, Irish whiskey.  This bottle utilized ex-peated whisky casks that were re-charred and then used to age their base spirit.  The whiskey was really smooth and had a nice charred oak flavor to go along with the typical vanilla and barley notes found in most of their offerings.  My palate was a bit fried by this point and I didn’t get much, if any, peat flavor.  The fact the casks were re-charred probably limited any peat smoke to a minuscule amount, but it was still a great whiskey that I’d love to get more of.  I believe they are distributed here in Virginia so it’s just matter of waiting and hoping the get this Glengarriff Series here soon."
