4.25,"Benromach Peat Smoke. Distilled in 2008, bottled in 2017. 46% ABV, 47 PPM, natural colour, lightly chill filtered. Honey and grassy notes on the nose. I also get a faint herbal peat smell. The palate is apples and pears,  vanilla, black licorise and some smoke. It has a medium long finish of peat, sea salt and oak. My first ever Benromach, great stuff! Cheers"
2.5,"Nose: very liqueur-like, unusual for whisky really, next to the ethanoly fumes there is a bid of chocolate and cinnamon - all in all sadly not very enjoyable. The peat also isn’t really taking any place and is barely noticeable if at all. Strange. It is more a smoky kind of experience. 

Palate: intense and characterful, sadly the alcohol doesn’t leave much space for fine nuances to be discoverable but it for sure is different and very unique. Very spicy and not at all sweet. 

A bid of water really does it good. Improves the nose, palate and finish significantly. Definitely makes it much more approachable by bringing out a nice malty sweetness. Interesting. 

The late and long finish is very nice - the best part of this whisky in my opinion. 

Wow, what a curious dram that was. Interesting for sure but highly subjective and challenging. Really hard to get behind the likeable aspects of it.  It definitely worth a try."
