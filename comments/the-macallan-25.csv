5.0,"To date, one of my favorite whiskies. The Amber hue of this concotion does little to bely the nose and palette. Immediate earth notes, accented by lanolin, wood smoke, and dark fruit. It lingers in your nose and mouth. Cedar and Orange zest, fig, subdued vanilla, and ever so slightly smoky. Superb."

5.0,"It really is nothing short of amazing.  There's a very nice sweetness and what I perceive as brandy on the nose.  It's immensely full bodied and finishes with another quick pop of brandy/grapes before washing away slowly.

I don't believe any bottle of scotch is worth $1300, but I'm glad I splurged and added it to my cabinet.  I'm gonna enjoy finishing this one off with friends over the next several months."

5.0,Listen folks the reason why you pay so much for macallan is they sold all their aged stuff years ago for filthy lucre and have nothing left!!  So now you pay over the odds for 12 yr old IF you can find it. Their new stuff is half decent but NOT aged. Maybe 5 to 8 yrs and called the reserve balls etc. that is why the 25 is and will remain the ultimate balance for many people between superb taste and legend

5.0,"I took a couple of days deciding which dram was to be the subject of this, my 100th whisky reviewed on the Barreled app. I have a handful of worthy contenders but I settled on this 25 year old Macallan to celebrate the occasion. 

This Speyside single malt is aged for a quarter century in sherry oak casks and bottled at 43% ABV. As all Macallans are, it's natural color. This one is a deep mahogany and if I had to venture a guess I would say it is non chill filtered.

My good friend Lee was generous enough to provide me with a 1 oz sample, but being that it's 1 oz vs our usual 2 (and I'm not complaining), I wasn't able to give it as thorough of run down as I normally do. Anyway, here goes. 

The nose is very mature, as is to be expected for a 25 year old. Warm toasted oak up front. Sherried raisins, sweet dried fruits. Oranges, red grapes, light cinnamon and apples. Aged vanilla and a mix of about 3:1 dark/milk chocolate. Plenty of honey and mixed berry/cherry pie. Lovely and elegant. 

The palate, again, elegant. A pop of spice, oak and wood smoke. Raisins, dates, apricots and black tea with honey. There is a little bitterness from the oak but it's not bad. 

Light to medium bodied mouthfeel. Silky, creamy and lightly oily. Dry on the back end. 
Medium length finish. Oak tannins, sherried oak, cherry syrup and a puff of smoke. 

This is by far the most expensive...anything...I've ever consumed. I believe Lee bought his bottle for $1300, but if I wanted to buy a bottle here in Michigan it would cost me a ridiculous $1800. It's very elegant and smooth. I was surprised by the level of smoke. It's nowhere near Islay levels, but up there for a Macallan. There is a bitterness on the finish that is a bit of a negative mark on an otherwise wonderful scotch. While this is a very good dram, I don't think it's even close to $1800 good. Personally, I think the Rare Cask Black is a superior offering. Regardless, I find myself very lucky to have even had the chance to taste such a rare and expensive scotch. Thanks again Lee. 4.75
Cheers"

4.5,"Raisiny nose, the sherry influence is obvious. 

Sherry, lots and lots of sherry.  Raisins and spice.  Oily texture, rich spicy flavor.  Nuts - almost chewy.  There is some tannic influence from the wood and aging - a bit herbal.  I found a bit of vanilla as I worked my way through the glass.

Dry wood in the finish, some smoke.  I bought this for $250 back in 2002.  It goes for well over $1,000 these days.  It's good.  Maybe it's worth $250, but definitely not $1,000+ good ;).  I could buy 15-20 solid, delightful bottles for what I'd pay for just this one.

It is delicious, but there are things that I'd rather drink, and things I'd feel less guilty drinking."

5.0,"I tasted this blind (THANK YOU LEE!!)...and my original guess was "" over 15 years of age, probably 20-25, because it's so silky smooth.  Either a Speysider or Highlander.  Stewed fruits, red fruits.  Port finish because of the color"".   I was dead wrong on the port finish...little did I know I was tasting a rarity.  ( and to think I was having this casually while playing Ticket to Ride with my 8 year old).   Just sheer elegance from start to finish...incredible experience.  I wouldn't  have the means to buy this, so it makes it that much more memorable, thanks to Lee!"
5.0,"This whiskey truly is a piece of history. I was waiting for a special occasion to drink it and it turned out to be a regular night at the house. The nose pits off sweet, spicy citrus at first with a little vanilla and some other fruit. Add water and the nose opens up with heavy raisins and oatmeal. The palate was chewy and fruity with most notes of raisins and slight spicy wood and vanilla. The finish was oh so smooth and the chewy, sweet raisin-oatmeal remained."

5.0,"Paid $100 for the shot. Insane sherry character. I’ve never smelt sherry more clearly before. The dram is very strong on the palate, it coats your mouth and entire face in a spicy sweet overload. The finish goes on for decades and is exceptionally smooth. I’d say this is up there with any dram I’ve ever had. Sure it costs a ridiculous amount of money and you can get a Glendronach or something like that for cheaper, but it’s Macallan and they are masters that can command a price for various reasons. You got the money? Don’t think twice. 100/100"

5.0,"Got sample of this from a friend. 2018 edition. Indicates this was distilled around 1992 1993ish, meaning it was made just before Macallan reduced golden promise barley ratio in 1994.


Nose: Raisins, Prunes, Cherries, Dates, Chocolate Oranges, Apples, Flowers, Cinnamon, Pepper, Meats, Vanilla

Palate: Raisins, Toffee, Cherries, Chocolate, Oak, Pepper, Meats, Figs

Finish: Flowers, Oak, Raisins, Chocolate, Pepper

Great stuff but feel it is underwhelming compared to its potential and price. Had this side by side with Glengoyne 25 and found the Glengoyne 25 to be better."

5.0,"Insane. Sherry never smelt more clear or powerful. The finish lasts for days and is beyond smooth. You’re always gonna have haters, but Macallan produce extraordinary whiskies that are some of the best in the world and they command a high price for them. But if you’re a Macallan lover like me and are lucky enough to afford it, don’t think twice. It’s a 100/100"
