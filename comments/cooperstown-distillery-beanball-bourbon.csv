4.0,"Butterscotch aroma with a little spicy note. A little less than medium bodied, smooth with a tickle of burn on the tongue. Spicy flavor, even a little fruitiness, I'm thinking red apples. I really enjoyed this. Plus, I'm a huge baseball fan but that bias did not affect my opinion of the whiskey."

3.0,"This has a surprising depth for being a younger, blended product. I get an edge of orange peel and blonde sawdust on the nose and then sugary wood on the palate before that wash of crackling spice. A bit shocked at myself, but would not kick it out of bed for eating crackers."

4.0,My son gave this to me as a birthday present and I’m glad he did. I admit I didn’t have high expectations when I opened it up recently but I was pleasantly surprised. Nice nose with hints of vanilla and green apple. Medium body with a really good lingering finish. I would like to use this in blind tasting with some of my bourbon buddies and see what their take on this is. Try a dram!

3.5,"Smells exactly like buttered popcorn with a pepper note. A bunch of spice and barrel on the palate. Medium finish. Pretty good for a blend of sourced MGP + their juice, especially at a low to mid-price. I like it. Will probably buy again."
