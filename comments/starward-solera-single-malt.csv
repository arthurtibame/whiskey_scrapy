3.5,"Creamy and fruity, this is a satisfying dram that is easy to drink without having to think too much about the contents of your glass. Not a bad note, which is more than you can say about many a Scotch."

3.5,"My favorite release from Starward yet! Aroma is sweet with malty and fruity notes; Palate is a soft velvety delivery of fruity, candy, earthy and malty tones; Finish slides through warmly and far too quickly."

4.0,"Solera is in the name so you would immediately expect sherry cask solera sysyem flavour profile. And yes, even though the color is golden amberish you do get your sherry dry fruit notes. I also found a note that I never found in other wiskey ""fresh cut cucumber"" just zipping in and out on your nose. The base of all this is your sugary notes but unlike your bourbon candy sugar. On top of all this is this beautiful floral notes that embellish the wiskey.

On the palate is your smooth flowing sherry notes with oak spicy notes that does not linger too long just there too tease your palate, and not much of bitterness as well.

Overall it's a beautiful wiskey."
4.25,"Holy sweetness. I'm getting caramel and honey up front with a cinnamon like bite. These flavors weaken and linger with the sherry taking over on the finish. It is definitely a different profile, and that is not a bad thing."

5.0,Great product.  Different anything else.  Tried this and other Starwards at Whiskey Live event.  Solera stood out for me.
3.0,"Nose: Intense caramel and toffee aromas, butterscotch, honey and a little vanilla.

Palate: A sweet, hefty butterscotch, caramel and mild spice arrival. As it develops creamy sherry and oak flavours emerge, but they remain subtle. Some dried fruit tastes – figs, dates, etc. – appear in the background along with some nutmeg.

Finish: The sherry and oak that surfaced mid-development carry on through to the end, which is well balanced.

The nose is quite heavy and sweet. It bears a passing resemblance to bourbon but does not have the strong vanilla and fruitiness. It’s also not quite like a scotch malt either – it’s somewhere between the two. The barley used is brewer’s barley that is generally used for ale, and they employ both brewer’s and distiller’s yeasts.
The maturation is period is short and intense (think 2-3 years of racking like a bourbon rather than long resting in a dunnage). Maturation is done entirely in re-toasted Australian apera (ie sherry) casks of varying sizes, and the contents are decanted from barrel to barrel in a solera-like process throughout the maturation cycle.

New World Whisky Distillery relocated to the suburb of Port Melbourne a couple of years ago, and this coincided with several changes to the distillery equipment, including a new wash still. As their new make spirit is typically aged for 2-3 years this means that all Starward whisky currently on retailer’s shelves (as at mid-2018)  is from the old distillery stock. Later this year will be the roll-out of the first whisky distilled and matured at the new premises. There has been a slight change of distillery profile, from a rather berry/fruity-rich character to a more caramel-centred and balanced style.

A comfortable and enjoyable whisky, lacking a little in complexity but making up for it with heft and style.  It reminds me a bit of some recent American craft malt whiskies.

“Above Average” : 3 stars"
