3.0,Peaty but pleasant. Looking forward to trying it again and looking for the fruitiness through the peat.
4.0,"At the Bow Bar. H's first Scott ever in March 2011 was AnCnoc but not this one. This is a good, peaty, but not too peaty malt. I'm enjoying it by the fireplace here."

3.0,"I really enjoy the work that comes out of Knockando. The nose is sweet and peaty, as is the palate. There's not much nuance here in the marriage between peat and sweetness. In other words, the peat feels kind of cut-and-paste for this dram. Maybe that's because I've been spoiled by Islay and the Isles.  Salty, spicy, fruity, mossy, with a sprightly finish. I'd have walked away with this bottle tonight if the price wasn't so up-charged ($80, whereas it's around $50 elsewhere). From tasting event, 12/17/16."

4.25,Full lots of peat but not over powering.
2.0,"A couple of months ago, I tried my first Ancnoc, the Flaughter.  Although somewhat two-dimensional (peat and sweet), it was well balanced and enjoyable.  I was looking forward to the Cutter because the peat is turned up a bit.  Unfortunately, neither the extra peat nor the dram as a whole worked for me. 

While the peat is not exactly turned up to 11, it nevertheless has the effect of overwhelming all else.  What's left under the peat is a non-descript mix of flavor from which I can't pick out much of anything.  And where the peat in the Flaughter is quite pleasant, the Cutter's peat is more of a bitter ash.  

The Flaughter is a nice whiskey, but I'm not sure who the Cutter's constituency is.  If you like balance, nuance and complexity, it's not for you.  And for peat lovers, there are far more agreeable and interesting options available."
3.75,Another wonderful peated scotch. This is a tick below the big Islays imo. That being said this still delivers lovely smoke and malt with some bread dough and oak. Finish is where it drops off. Doesn't last all night like most smokies and a little too dry. Im a fan though especially at closeout price of $36
4.25,Surprisingly complex after the phenolic nose and straw yellow coloring. The right amount of heat for an enjoyable dram.
3.75,"20.5 ppm. Spicy not sweet nose.  Strong peat finish

3.5,This taught me that there actually is a thing as too much peat. great for adding a bit to other scotches though!
3.75,"Smoother then I thought it would be. not too complex, but if you wanted to introduce someone to peat this would be a good one to use. had with @silverelizard"
