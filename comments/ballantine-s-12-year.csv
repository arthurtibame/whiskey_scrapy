3.0,Nose is ethanol and distant floral and fruit. Coloured blend but the taste makes up for the nose. Malt and vanilla builds to a nice full buttery fruit. Almost Sweet finish ends with tart tannin oak but nicely balanced. Not bad at all!  I prefer Johnnie Black just for its more characterful delivery but still one of best blends. 3 stars or 90. Enjoy

4.0,"Nose - Rich floral fruits, dark caramelized apple cider, prunes, caramel, honey.

Taste - Sweet spice, chocolate & honey, dark apple juice, prunes, hint of smoke.

Finish - Lingering dark honey sweet, light floral pruney apple cider, light brine

JW Blue label is pretty mush same thing, only woodier and a bit richer, but hey for $37 a liter I'm in."

3.0,"Whisky number 12 from the batch of 12 affordable blends I've been rating recently. End of the line, but we're finishing on a good note.

Nose: Similar to Ballantine's Finest, its younger brother, but with a little more of everything. Malty, caramel and vanilla toffee (Jersey caramels), mellow buttery notes, fruity. Clean but sweet and with a hint of oak - very pleasant.

Palate: Creamy sweet and rich honey/caramel arrival, fruity (stone fruits, stewed prunes, oranges), No smoke to speak of, except perhaps in the very base of the grain component.

Finish: Short but sweet and a touch astringent towards the end.

All in all, quite good value and perfectly enjoyable neat or with a dash of water. I'd put this in the same league as JW Black Label.

""Above Average"" : 3 stars"

3.0,"Low expectations have the advantage of leaving room for pleasant surprises, as happened with this 12-year-old Ballantine's. The nose is 'Auchentoshan + X': floral, light and fragrant with notes of tinned fruits, marzipan and soft spices. Certainly not bad for a Blended Scotch! Heather honey, parsley and a spicy touch of oak dominate the palate, very 'smooth' although I hate to use the word. This whisky does not benefit from additional water. As with most blends, the finish doesn't linger and remains rather vague. Still, it is almost better than JW Black Label.

3.75,Much better and more elegant than ballantine's finest. On the nose you get peatyness and vanilla cream. On the palate is sweet at first with caramel and then you get hot and spicy wood. A normal dram but a good one if you consider the price. 78/100
