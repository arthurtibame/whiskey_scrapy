3.0,"Nice mouth feel, if a little sharp, and very toffee tasting. Almost slightly sweet. Decent for the price point, and nicer over ice."

2.0,"Liked the 3 wood for smoothness and subtle caramel and spice, but Duty-Free stuck me with Heartwood as the same. NOT. It’s made for airports, bites the tongue, lacks good flavor. You can taste the old, rotten, recycled casks they use for this cheap export. Beware."
