3.25,"Got a bottle as a gift. Enjoying with a few ice cubes. It starts out rough, but the more sips I take the smoother it gets.  Not bad at all."
3.25,"For starting off with a sickeningly sweet, almost brandy-like scent, this bourbon drinks quite well and smooth, once you taste past the sweetness. The initial taste coats the mouth, but thankfully the higher proof brings a lovely spice to the mix, which balances the young mash well. With the grains coming through well due to the age, but the sweetness and spiciness balancing out, it's hard to tell if this is a rye or wheat base, but I would lean towards rye. The finish polishes away some of the sweetness, and actually tastes a little bit more aged than just 1 year, if that's truly only the case."

3.75,"This is a Bevmo private collect bottle even though it does not say so on the bottle itself. 
On the nose i get corn bread, butter scotch candy, musty hay and some cooking spices, the palate is creamy and smooth with a hint of the butter scotch and corn bread, the finish is hot, as one would expect from a whiskey this young, and short with some musty corn. 
Seems like an excellent value at about $25."

4.0,"Wow, this one is so smooth for being so young. The bottle says it’s blended with barrels no less than 1yr old.
Very different from most bourbons I’ve tried. It’s bright, but does not bite. It has a shoe leather and old barn must that I love. And I think I can taste the corn. Would be interested to know the mash bill for this one.
I am shocked that there is almost zero info on this one on the internet. And not even a real profile for it on this app. Maybe it’s that new.
Either way, I’m loving it and enjoy how different it is from the others in my collection."
3.75,"Cinnamon, apples, maybe cloves, a touch of butter, caramel? Heavy barrel bite but stands up well to water or ice. Pretty delicious!"
