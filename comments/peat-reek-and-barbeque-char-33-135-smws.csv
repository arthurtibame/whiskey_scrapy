5.0,"Another five-star delight at this week’s Ardbeg extravaganza. I’ve had a sample of this before and it didn’t disappoint the second time around. While the 25 year old Lord of the Isles is a classical symphony of a whisky, this youthful nine-year-old is a rock concert turned up to 11. What it lacks in sophistication, it more than makes up for in concentrated flavor."
5.0,"Drammers Club pour. Very good with notes of Raisins, Dates, Cherries, Prunes, Smoke, Tar, Citrus, Seashells, Pepper, Toffee, Vanilla, and Almonds"
5.0,"You don’t have to be familiar with the Scottish Malt Whisky Society’s numbering system to identify this as an Ardbeg. This nine-year-old cask bottled in 2017 is true to the distillery’s DNA and in many ways plays liked Uigeadail on steroids, with a higher ABV and an age statement. The nose is sweet mesquite barbecue smoke, with a hint of pine, burnt matches and nutmeg — they could they have called this Cooking Cattle in a Forest Fire. I found it too overpowering to drink neat at its 60.2% ABV but fortunately it’s not too fussy about how much water you add: my sample went down swimmingly diluted to around 50%. Flavors of dark chocolate, dried brisket and kippers combine into a rich and slightly sweet treat. The finish is chocolate and licorice. One to sip and savor. I’d rate this 4.5/5 and fair value at its original price, but I wouldn’t pay silly money on the secondary market."
