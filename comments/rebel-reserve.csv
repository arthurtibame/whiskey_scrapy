2.0,Decent wheater for about $25. Not as sweet as Weller.
2.0,Honey sweet very smooth finish. At this price point of $17 it's worth every penny. Bought because of reviews and they were spot on. Go out find it and enjoy it!!

3.0,"~$18
I wouldn't drink this one by itself, but good for mixing with Sprite and/or Red Bull.
For the price, I would just go with regular Rebel Yell."

3.0,"Got as a gift and perfect timing – nice enough to drink neat, mixes smoothly, too. A bit standard, but in a good way. An ice cube opens it up."

3.0,"The bourbon here is a steal at the price point. Nose is interesting with some honey and fruit and even some cinnamon. Taste is similar but with more baking spices and honey. Finish is good with a mild burn, spicy and a hint of licorice. Good stuff"
