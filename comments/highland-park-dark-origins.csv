3.0,"Tasted at Hunger n' Thirst, Lancaster, PA. A little hot at first. Earthy sweet peat smoke. Rich raisin-heavy sherry and sea salt, all combining to create a smoky salted-caramel flavor. (Gives the impression of a vegetarian Lagavulin, if that can't be taken as a slight...) Added water increases the sweetness and forms an estimable scotch mist! Risky on the palate; Hot oak, mild pear and nutty. Quick finish, Sweet smoke returns. It's definitely enjoyable, but not exceptional, and woefully overpriced for a NAS."

4.0,I hesitated trying this but am very glad I finally got around to trying and buying. I am a huge fan of HP and this is  great whisky. I have heard comments that it is harsh or rough round the edges. Maybe they changed the bottling slightly from when it was first released. This is a really great example of what HP can produce. Typical HP smoke and honey with great sherry flavors. You must try this whisky!

4.0,Strong sherry for me. Some tobacco on the back. Lots going on up front. I'm new to highland park. Probably should have explored more of their entry level bottles. Bottle looked cool. I'm a sucker for paint and font.
4.0,"Very impressed. 
Nose: sherry, honey, heather, Ash,  smoke, brine, hint of sulphur,inviting sticky sweetness, damp sherry soaked infused wood chips
Palate: full on super sweet sherry attack wow wow wow, smoke lingering, spiciness, ashy, super sweet, milk chocolate
Finish: spicy, sherry sherry sweet sweetest,  sherry sweetness remains

Hmm where to begin. First I gotta say that this is VERY different from the 12 and 18. This is really good, honestly my favorite highland park. This is like the 12's assertiveness with the 18's richness turned up 46.8% but richer and more flavourful. This is a sherry bomb with the heather,  briney, highland park smoke. The sherry is really nice, it's close to overwhelming all the other flavours but I don't mind because I like big powerful whiskies. I'd give it 5/5 but for a NAS at only 46.8% at $100 it puts it in territory of other really good scorches."

4.0,"The sherry is prominant and dominant on nosing.  Give it time to open and the aromas of light brown sugar, some dark fruits, dates or figs, and a pinch of brine waft around.  A touch of tobacco is first to arrive and opens to almonds and/or walnuts and a touch of oak.  They all gradually fade and leave the mouth slightly oaken with a touch of grapefruit and white pepper spice.  Add a small amount of water and the dram is rounder and sweeter and strengthens the grapefruit on the finish.  Preferable with water.  This is a slightly more concentrated and tighter version of HP12 where the flavors are slightly amped-up.  Makes a wonderful sipper that is best enjoyed when there is time and the bustle of everyday can be pushed aside for a little bit.  Many thanks Pranay for the generous sample.  I was waiting for that moment to sit back to concentrate and enjoy this dram.  Much enjoyed.  [Dried glass: Brown sugar and vanilla][90/100][9/2/16]"

4.0,"Appearance- the color of Dark Origins is very deserving of its name, it is visibly darker than others from this distillery
Nose- sweet floral smoke of pipe tobacco mingled with spiked fruit punch
Body- the fruit fragrance fades here while the floral sweetness comes through mingling with woody vanilla and light peat
Finish- a very warm finish with  spiciness of red pepper comes through in the finish giving way to a return in pipe smoke that lingers lightly 
Note- I was pleasantly surprised by the easy transition this dram provides from un peated sherried scotches to a peated scotch. I purchased this for Dad for Father's Day but liked it so much that it will now play a permanent role in my own collection.  I will continue on my journey with this distillery and look forward to the next discovery. 18 year?"

4.0,"Fancy bottle, marketing-driven NAS presentation and a hefty price tag: why on earth would I review Highland Park Dark Origins? Because it's surprisingly good! Heavy sherry aroma with spices, baked apple and distant peat smoke greets the nose. I get raisins, dates, polished wood and, oddly enough, menthol cigarettes. The taste is sweet, then astringent, before the sweetness returns with walnuts, black tea and well-measured sherry cask influence. After a savory and mildly peaty finish, I must confess I am almost sad that this whisky has been discontinued.

3.0,"I swear that I am no where near a bottle of Ardbeg Uigeadail, but the nose on this is eerily similar. Maybe also some lapsang souchong, as I usually also detect from Lagavulin 16. On the palate neat, it's a nice smoke, but I miss that oily mouth coat.  That maybe from immaturity. Smelled a bit like a port, but the taste brought the peat. This is not super duper hot, just a little, so let's just drop a few small drops on this and see what happens.  The intense chocolate fudge is still there, maybe even more so.  The sherry finally comes through a  bit more, which I wanted, without losing the pepper and peat. Better mouth feel, and less burn.  With just a few drops of water, I'd say a 2.8-2.9 , so I'll round up a smidgen to a 3.  Glad I tried it on vacation this week.  The color says natural, but it is intensely dark. I wish I knew the ages of what's going on here."

It has the aroma of traditional Sherry based Highlander like a Macallan, but then quickly lets you know on the palette that it's really an islander, and undeniably a HP.  Tabacco, almonds, grapefruit, vanilla.  A bit salty, but not like a Talisker.  Finish is quick and hot---young definately, but who cares if it's a NAS and still good.  Question is:  is it worth close to $90?   Not sure...I think so, yes."

3.0,"The bottom line here is that Highland Park has produced a sweeter, peatier version of Highland Park 12 with more rough edges.  The nose takes a while to settle down and initially reeks of an earthy, almost sour peat that reminds me of compost or spoiled vegetables.  Thankfully, after 10-15 minutes, that unpleasant scent subsides into a much better roast coffee aroma.  Dark Origins reveals its sherried components on the palate, with lots of dark fruit flavors, raisins, some orange, and tendrils of smoke.  The palate is moderately oily and has a decent mouthfeel to boot.  It finishes on that strong coffee note, which I find to be a Highland Park signature, like a slightly peatier version of the 12.  At $80 when it was available, this strikes me as half a solid scotch and half a cash grab."

3.0,"Nose - Sweet sherried smoke, almost like a dark red wine being mulled with a bunch of dark dried stone fruits over a campfire in a kettle.

Taste - Like eating a prune that's been re-hydrated with a sweet white wine heated over a wood heated campfire, lightly drying mouthfeel with a hint of oaky bitter, like a charred oak branch fell in your mulled red wine.

Finish - Lingering charred fruit bittersweet, light smoke, hint of medicinal sweet.

Score - 75/100

Final Thoughts - I enjoyed the nose on this one but after that it fell a bit flat. It became dominated by a sweet smoky fruit and that's about it. Light spicy notes at the end, but the medicinal fruity smoky finish reminded me a bit of a sweet band-aid which was a bit off putting. I'm glad I only got a sample of this as I think I'd be a bit disappointed if I had a full bottle of this, especially at WA State prices."

3.75,"I find Whiskey hunting can sometimes be like a good game of Poker. Sometimes you just get on a hot streak after a bit of a frost and you just need to ride that streak! This month has been that way for me with Single Malts specifically! This is one I stumbled upon for $49.97! At that price, I felt the value was too good to pass up with this being discontinued and given that I quite enjoyed the pour I had of the 12 yr old expression. 
I am quite partial to a heavily Sherried single malt and the fact it's Peated is just a bonus for me. On to the tasting! 
Right upon entry I get some initial smoke which quickly fades to reveal orange peel, toasted walnuts, wood and a hint of old leather. Red fruits become noticable on the mid pallette with campfire marshmallows leading to a medium to long finish with oak, sherry, smoke and a hint of brine. I taste the subtle maritime notes as the finish fades. 
There is for sure some noticable astringency that I associate with old Whisky's. As this is an NAS offering it's anyone's guess how much older stock is in it. Based on the notes I am getting I am convinced there is some pretty old stock in the blend (notes I definitely didn't get with the 12 yr). Lovely pour and I am happy to have bought the bottle! 
At the $80+ price point it typically goes for, I would call this a fair-ish value. At the $49.97 price point it's a steal for sure. My one critique would be it's a bit heavy to be a frequent pour, but one that will go into my after dinner rotation for sure! Cheers all!"

4.25,"Think Glenlivrt Founders Reserve but with the full body and character of typical of most Isle scotch.

N: citrus, honey, fruity, rich, sweet

P: Sweet, fruity with vanilla on the tongue, touch of peat?, citrusy orange note peaking through reminds me of orange creamcicle

F: Sweet and smooth, if it weren't for the back up fruity notes this would literally taste like I just ate an orange creamcicle with a touch of peat.

I like this bc the orange comes out of nowhere on the back and lasts into the finish. If you want this straight, DO IT! Would be my preference. Could see this as an interesting choice in Cocktails. Definitely would need it to be spirit driven to not lose complexity."

3.0,"Nose: unmistakeable sherry notes on the nose. These aren’t sweet fruits though. I smell something closer to cranberry, maybe prune? 
Palate: I don’t find chocolate, but it does have fruity notes. Maybe the chocolate I was looking for was milk, while this was dark. Maybe dark chocolate, it doesn’t taste the 46%. It’s watered down. Didn’t taste as well as I remembered 
Finish: smoke"

4.0,"This NAS Highland Park dram is excellent. It boasts that it is the kin of the Highland Park 18, as it should. The nose is rich and promising, and the honeycomb note I associate with Highland Park is present here. On the palate this whisky is initially salty. A quenching minerality accompanies luxe notes of black plum and cardamom. The peat and sherry partner stunningly in Dark Origins. The waxy Highland Park trademark is limited to the nose this time, as the mouthfeel is actually somewhat  oily. I enjoy a malty and spicy finish and a decadently oaken aftertaste. A truly excellent whisky."

3.75,"The nose has honeycomb, minerals, heather, orange tang, and peat.  The smoke phenols are grassy, like a dried, dead overgrowth entwined with cooked fruits from the sherry casking.  Palate has spiced apples, fruitcake, candied nuts, brown raisins, and brine.  The finish shifts sharply toward black pepper and an unusual herbal fruit note not unlike junipers--rather uncharacteristic but a welcome distinctive in this fairly short but poignant finish.  Also finishing are smoked meats and musty wood."

4.25,"I have a weakness for highland park, because i love it's marketing. Dark Origins is all about a lovely smugglers story who not only founded the distillery ilegally, but also had secret ways to sell the whisky to the public.

Bottled at 46.8%abv; auburn poslished mahogany color, lovely.

On the nose a very soft peat note, not what you expect from your typical Highland Park. Brownies, Slight Tobbacco, Fresh forest, a Slight salt note and Garlic bread. A little dissapointed on the nose, it made me think i was in front of a bad dram... how wrong i was about it.

On the palate is was awesome: Caramel, Orange, Brownies, Oaky, Acid, big Smoke note, some Salt and Clove. Finish was long and salty with hints of smoke and bonfire.

Overall this dram is an 89 over 100, points deducted on the nose but definitively a good whisky."
