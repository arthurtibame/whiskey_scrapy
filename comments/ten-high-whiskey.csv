4.0,"Ten High has an amber appearance, which was darker than I expected. The aroma is of wood, char, caramel, dried flowers, and a touch of dry, candied fruit. Taste is of charred wood (stronger than expected), dried fruit, a bit of light brown sugar, some straight alcohol, and some corn. Mouthfeel is somewhat heavy, and Ten High does linger, in the finish, but it's not cloying. A good deal for $9.99 for a 750 ml bottle."

1.25,Pretty unpleasant but not undrinkable. Taste is very short but you can catch familiar notes of whiskey such as vanilla and caramel. After that it's a cheap vodka grain burn. If you want to drop $10 on whiskey get Benchmark.

2.0,An OK value bourbon. would be good for a sour or other cocktail but not fantastic neat or on rocks.
1.0,"Appearance: The color I found in this once bourbon now blended American was a light honey gold. The legs were thin and very oily.

Nose: The nose was pretty faint overall. Notes present were of caramel, candy corn, freshly cut apple, and musty supply closet added a strange funky note.

Taste: The palate was disappointingly boring. There was a hint of cherry, a tease of some oakiness, but really just the oily body and grain alcohol taste is what stood out to me. 

Finish: Not much stood out until the rising heat and burn in the back of the throat, then there it faded into an almost sugary finish. 

Thoughts: It was alright; I’m glad I tried it, but I won’t be recommending this to anyone. It may be a decent vodka alternative if you wanted slightly more character, (Keep in mind, I am not a vodka man.) but for a whiskey I am not impressed. Here’s to your better products, Sazerac! Cheers!"

2.0,Sweet and spicy but you can taste a grain alcohol bite on the finish.  Standard well bourbon

3.0,"At only $8 for the bottle, I really expected this to be disgusting. But I had been told that my late grandfather used to drink Ten High back in the old days, so I just had to give it a try! To be honest, I still like this better than black label Jack. The flavor is not too bad, although it doesn't last very long on the tongue. I've had a lot better, but I've also had a LOT worse."
2.0,"Thin and kinda flavorless, not bad but not a whole lot there. Basic vanilla caramel flavor, just faint."

1.5,Smooth and Warm in the Stomach.  less burn than KG but few high flavor notes and muddled low flavor notes difficult to distinguish.  Semi sweet but bitter on the roof of the mouth. Decent Rail Blended Whiskey.
3.0,Not bad as a well in a $9.50 old fashioned. .
0.5,Bad. Least drinkable whiskey I've had.

2.0,"The rail whiskey where I work. Nearly every bottle tastes slightly different, much to the amusement of the staff. Not a terrible cheap whiskey!"
3.0,Best value bourbon that I've found.  Great for cocktails and decent on the rocks.

3.0,Has a mild almost sweet finish. Good for making whiskey sour or mixing with sodas. Not a great choice for rocks or neat drink.
