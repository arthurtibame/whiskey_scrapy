4.25,"Bourbon richness shows it’s self in this dram more than any other Laddie I’ve tried. That’s not to say that the Bruichladdich character doesn’t show through, it does."
3.5,"Pastry-like nose lacks a little power and nuance, but does show some salt hints.  Palate is mainly salt and ocean with a touch of golden fruit.  Finish is quite long with lingering peat.  This doesn’t do much for me."
