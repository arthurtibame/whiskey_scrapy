5.0,"Every now and then i get invited to taste a super old, super expensive whiskey. This time my friend, who already invited me to taste a ""Very Old Fitzgerald"", now scored a ""VERY VERY OLD FITZGERALD"" a 12yo bourbon, 100 proof (50%abv). I am not as studied in bourbon as i am in scotch, but i will always love a good dram, specially if it is vintage, rare and wonderful. 

On the nose, it is incredible. Feels old in the aroma: smells like an Old library, Cherries, Prunes, Soap. Brownies and figs. Very refined. Glue. 

On the palate, it is also amazing. A strong prune note. It is like prune POWDER, don't ask me how that works. Feels old. Green mangos, reminds me of my time as a highschool student; the school bus stopped at certain semaphores where people sold this green mangos. 

Aftertaste is a whole different thing. Still a great one. Spent matches, Wonderful spices, Wasabi and/or Chilli. Tastes like Dust. Cardboard. Yes, all that is true. 

Overall this is a super interesting dram. It just doesn't feel as anything i have ever tasted before. I wouldn't stay a whole night drinking it, but to taste it once seems interesting enough. Because of how good it is, but so different on the nose, palate and aftertaste, i will deduct 2 points on balance. So 98/100. Cheers!"
