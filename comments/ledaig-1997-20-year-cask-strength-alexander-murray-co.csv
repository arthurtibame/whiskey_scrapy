5.0,Best whiskey I've ever had.  Peaty smoked bbq magic
4.25,"Strong peat, band aids, iodine, light burnt rubber and stone fruit notes on the nose, there's burnt rubber, peat and stone fruits on the spicy, buttery, round palate, long finish with peat smoke, some sweet and savory notes, there's a slightly bitter note that disappears a couple minutes in. A splash of water just kinda muted everything, I think did not make it better."
