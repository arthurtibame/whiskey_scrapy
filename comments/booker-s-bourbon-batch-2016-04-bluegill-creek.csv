4.0,"Let's be real: the proof on this is not fooling around. Bottle lists 128 and the friends I've shared with say you can really tell. Even having largely immunized my tastebuds over the years this runs a bit hot and piquant. But ultimately I quite enjoy that aspect and you can tame things down with a bit of water should you wish. 

Playing it straight, I get a smooth, grainy sweetness that rises to float above the spiky warmth - almost like cornbread topped with thick caramel sauce. Flavorful but not rich or heavy. Nose will open your sinuses with a light chocolate edge and a tinge of white pepper. 

Adding water changes things up quite a bit. Nose shifts toward cinnamon cereal and the caramel flavors bloom to fill your mouth."

4.0,That distinctly long burn you expect from bookers. This ones pretty woody. Had to get a bottle before the price jump

4.0,Surprisingly smooth to be a 126 proof. Nice wood flavor with hints of tobacco. Getting nuts and cherries after adding some ice. Slight cinnamon on the aftertaste. Glad I scooped this bottle early on in my bourbon collecting journey.
4.0,"Fantastic bourbon! needs water or ice to bring it down a bit, but so tempting to drink neat."

4.0,First barrel proof bourbon I had and the one that got me into the bourbon game. Sweet with a great burn on the back end

4.0,"Strong burn but such a pleasing taste. 
So good. Sweet vanilla with a little Carmel."
3.0,Very one note to me and that note is CINNAMON RED HOTS. Doesn’t really have the complexity I’d like to see.

2.0,"Rich nose with sweet corn and brown sugar

Intense palate with oak, leather, smoke and a hint of something sweet like pineapple, more than a little harsh

Hot medium long finish with oak and a little cocoa and oak, dry, astringent, not altogether pleasant"

null,"Love it!  A long pour with one large ice cube.  Take your first sip after 2 mins, go back for more as it melts and it'll be like drinking 3 different good bourbons in one sitting.

First mouthful was a huge hit, it mellows out, but stays very robust, and I will definitely buy again."

4.25,"Nose- peanut butter, vanilla, brown sugar, hazelnut, caramel, toasted oak

Palate-Toasted oak, peanut oil, vanilla, brown sugar, cinnamon 

Finish- Medium, chewy finish with notes of cinnamon spice and caramel

Great bourbon. Very good nose and the palate is nice and balanced, a palate that developed and changed as I drank it. I love the peanut notes I get on the nose and palate. Extremely balanced for 128 proof and drinks much lower than the proof."
4.5,Very smooth and nice.  No burn.
4.5,"Strong but very tasty. Gift from my father in law, he gets major brownie points for this one."
3.75,"If you like your bourbons hot, spicy, and high proof, this one's for you.  Did I mention it's spicy?  Oddly, I added a few drops of water, which only to seemed to make it spicier.  

While ita not exactly my cup of tea (glass of whiskey?), there's a lot here that I can appreciate. The only other bourbon that I've had that manages to avoid tasting like a small blowtorch at this ABV is William Larue Weller."
4.5,"I am so addicted to this bourbon.

-Cheers"

4.0,"to the eye: color is a lush, caramel in color, legs fast moving.
to the nose: sweetness of caramel up front with lingering oak undertone.
to the taste: initial sweetness, followed by cinnamon burn, oak after flavior, mouth stayed quit warm, nice smooth warmth heading down the throat.  Despite the high proof was easy to drink neat, if your accustomed to having the alcohol burn. Please and after taste remains for some time.

added some water, really calmed the proof down to the smell, and eleminated much of the alcohle bite, without affecting the sweetness and cinomon burn.

A pleasant relaxing dram..."
4.0,great flavors. lots of spices and heat. great sip for a rainy Seattle night.
