2.0,"Still only has a singular tasting note, but much less burn and smoother than their original batches. Nothing to write home about, fine for mixing, not for sipping."
3.0,Add another star for single barrel. Great heaviness to its body with vanilla and cinnamon notes all over. Nice citrus finish.

3.0,I tried this a few years back and thought it needed some more age (I think it was only 1 year). I tried it more recently and it has come a long way. This is now a solid bourbon.

3.0,The review description nails this one. Bananas hit you on first whiff.  A slightly watered down old fashion moderately heavy on the spice and not too sweet.  Easy to sip.  Nothing bad but nothing great.

5.0,"Wyoming…the Wild West…

One of the grand signatures of American heritage, just thinking about the western frontier plains stirs up images of weatherbeaten cowboys, open ranges, crackling campfires, oiled leather saddles, dusty boots and plank-board shanty towns where the weary could stroll into a tavern after days of ranging and herding, sidle up to the brass rail and have the barkeep pour the kind of dram that would kickstart a night that went well into the next morning…

I knew it was possible to distill such a complex and flavorful spirit from the talent behind Wyoming Whiskey, but the ability to infuse the raw and visceral essence of the American frontier, into the very spirit that I am tasting right now...that takes more than just talent…that takes true passion and artistry; a pure and deep love for what you do from sunup to sundown and even in the cricket hours to the minutes before the dawn. This is the feeling that coursed through me after taking my very first sip of their Single Barrel; a true love of making American Whisky.

When you close your eyes and take a sip of this dram, and let its alchemy wash over senses, you can literally taste the care, the commitment and the pride that goes into every drop of this Bourbon Whiskey.

What I am tasting: Wyoming Whiskey Barrel #841
Single Barrel Bourbon Whiskey at 44% ABV (88 Proof)
Bottled on 9 /1/2015 and bottled EXCLUSIVELY for Bottled Wyoming

Color: A deep, weatherbeaten copper; very typical of the color profile of the old west.
Packaging: I truly appreciate the extra mile that went into investing into the “Wyoming” and “Whiskey” mold details in their proprietary bottle. 

Tasting Notes: Neat
On The Nose: Robust aroma of a thick, jammy Orange Marmalade, Butterscotch, Caramel Creme, a hint of Vanilla and a touch of cinnamon and white pepper and a very slight whisper of a floral, rose petal. 

With Water: A few drops of water unlocks a deeper an richer warmth of the nosing. The floral essences become more vibrant as they intermingle deftly and delicately to complete the richness of the nosing experience.

On the Tongue: From the tip of the tongue, there is an initial sweetness, but not cloyingly so. The orange takes a different profile as I discover more of a mandarin orange sweetness instead of a tropical citrus zest, there are also definite laters of vanilla, the caramel creme is still very prominent as is the spiciness of the White Oak. There is also a wonderfully delicate expression of rosewater towards the finish.

With Water: What I absolutely love about this medium is that only a few drops of water elevates the textural profile so slightly; a new experience of velvety richness as the crisp spiciness of the White Oak influence begins to subside ever so slightly.

FInish: A rich and robust, well rounded mouth feel and a succulence that comes from the complexity in the tasting profile. The finish lingers with a welcoming, silky and satin-smooth tapering into a crisp dryness complimented with a hint of peppery spice. 

From my tasting notes, it is fairly obvious how much I have enjoyed tasting this bourbon whiskey. Over the course of the last few months, I have learned to appreciate whisky from the Scotch Single Malt families of products; of which I love and enjoy immensely.

However, thanks to Mark Gillespie and his podcast WhiskyCast - and the tasting notes and ratings that HE has given Wyoming Whiskey, I felt compelled to trust his judgement and try a bottle for myself. And I couldn’t be happier - partially because this is a great product - but even more so, because it is an American product and I am proud to support this American business.

The greatest compliment that I can give this expression of Wyoming Whiskey is this: I will absolutely buy another bottle, perhaps several to give to friends, because this is a product that I absolutely love. When you set out on an epicurean journey and you find the right flavor…you know without a doubt, that you have found something truly special. In this whiskey - I found something truly special. I found the flavor of the American Pioneering “Spirit”.

It's not that it is bad Whiskey, it's just that the particular batch is unmemorable. I think the small batch bourbon would be better suited for mixed drink status. With its heat and spice notes, it would probably make a hell of an old-fashioned."

  From nose to finish this whiskey transitions from sweet and floral to earthy and toasty/oaky. It gave me the sense of passing through all the seasons of the year. It is both smooth and mild, but not boring or plain. I really liked the character of this whiskey, especially for being 88 proof. It’s just a good sipping whiskey, straight or on the rocks."

5.0,"So how can I best describe my very favorable impression of this whiskey? Let's say that if bourbons were guys, this is the one I would want my daughter to marry. Yeah I know, I recently rated Woodford Reserve Double Oak pretty high, but it's just too high falutin. The Wyoming Whiskey Small Batch Bourbon is one you'll have fun with. You can take it fishing or to the local high school football game! Even if you don't catch any fish or run into an old girl friend (I mean really old!), you will still have a good time with the WWSBB. This whiskey will have your back and lie to your wife to keep you out of trouble! Yep, its that good. 

It coats the glass beautifully and has notes of toasted nuts, vanilla, caramel, maple and leather on the nose. On the palate I picked up licorice, hazelnuts, and a cereal graininess with a bit of oiliness and a very slight sweetness. I didn't even try it with a bit of added water, it was great just the way it was. The dry glass - loose black tea and leather.

I got the 'Atta Boy hat for serving this whiskey at a neighborhood party a few weeks ago. WWSBB has earned a permanent place on my shelf. I'm not saying it will replace the Rittenhouse Rye that I keep loaded in my pocket flask. But I am saying that I need to get another flask."
2.0,"Astringent on the nose. Maybe some aged cherry, too. Young and oaky (not necessarily in a good way) tasting. The finish is light and sweet (fruity) tho, contradicting the initial taste. 3-3.25"
4.0,"I was a little underwhelmed. I mean, you'd think that Wyoming would be a perfect place for a good, old-fashioned, American style whiskey, right? Cowboys and bison and old forts and the Oregon Trail and all that...you can practically hear the creaky saloon doors swing open for you. But, much like how a quick trip north from Colorado reveals that Wild West-sounding places like Laramie and Cheyenne are now home to lots of generic strip malls and single family houses, the romance of the Golden West doesn't quite make it past the promotional materials here. The nose is nice enough - apple pie a la mode and Raisinets. The palate, however, is kind of an uninspired letdown, the equivalent of mediocre Chinese takeout joints next to a Verizon store and a Payless. There's just not much to distinguish it here - some vanilla and caramel and spice, and a surprising grape jelly note at the finish, but that's about it. Is it bad? No. Is it exciting? Only if you'd like to ride your horse into the sunset...on your way to Qdoba.

Addendum: With time, this opened up wonderfully - loads more flavor. Waves of vanilla, spice, raisin, grape jelly, dried fig and apricot. I've upped my rating by a star, and I'm encouraged to explore more offerings from the distillery!"

3.5,"Part 2 of my SuperBowl drams (my buddies did a better job than I in providing this bottle), I didn't have time to post my tasting notes last night! One more remaining (that one is a special one)! Back to this dram. It's a craft Distillery that's finally got some nice aged stock and is really hitting their stride. I remember the first time I tasted this Bourbon, it wasn't great. A bit of a Frakenstien of a Bourbon with notes just hodgepodged together for a mess of a pallette. Fast forward 4 years and my my things have improved. 
The average age is now north of 6 years with the youngest barrel being at least 5 years old. Batch size is relatively small at 40 barrels. Mashbill is wheated (68% corn, 20% wheat and 12% malted barley). On to the pallette:
Upon entry it's sweet with burnt brown sugar, coffee cake and caramel the predominant notes. Mid palatte gets a nice dose of tobacco and oak which continues thru the medium finish that lingers. Sweet notes come in and out (toffee and vanilla). It's well put together and unlike the Tin Cup the low proof doesn't hold the flavor back! 
At $40 a bottle it's a nice wheater option. It's better than Maker's and Larceny. Worse than Weller 12 and Antique. Big upgrade on the craft wheater options like TX and Big Level. So all in all it's a solid value at $40. It won't blow you away and it's definitely not the best option at that price. However, you could do worse. If you want to support a craft distiller putting out quality, this is a good option. 
Cheers all!"

Frankly this is not really fair to WW, but then it is on them to deliver quality.  

Nose is a little odd, with acetone and oak, and sadly there are some notes of bandaid and banana peel coming on.  Taste is sugarless iced tea followed by rye spice. I mean, exactly that.  This is kinda weird. Don't completely hate it (I do like sugarless iced tea), but man is it weird.  7/4/19"

3.75,"Nose: Not much punch, but some depth going on.  Luxardo cherries, citrus oil.  Roses.  Vanilla, brown sugar, oak.  Dusty corn.  Honey.  Fig newtons.

Palate: Straightforward and bright - dusty corn, brown sugar, vanilla.  Cream.  Orange blossoms.  Charred oak.  Mint.  Slightly grassy and herbaceous - hay.  Mouthfeel is lighter.  Finish starts off with Nilla wafers, bananas, and peanuts with some bright ethanol riding along.  Evolves and ends simply with the bright and shiny ethanol character slowly disappearing.  Some strawberry shows up at the tail end.

Other notes: Not bad overall.  Not something I'd feel compelled to keep around, but the flavor profile is pretty solid all around.  Not doing anything out of left field or unusual, though I'd be curious to see this aged a little longer and bottled at closer to 90 or 95 proof - there are some Eagle Rare vibes that are buried in there.
