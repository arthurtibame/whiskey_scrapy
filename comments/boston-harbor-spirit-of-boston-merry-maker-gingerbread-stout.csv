2.5,These whiskies are interesting but taste too young. It does smell like a ginger cinnamon nutmeg chocolate stout. Spicy like red hot cinnamon candies. This would be great in a holiday cocktail.

2.5,"Intense, Christmas, memorable but tough to drink regularly."
2.5,"Appearance: tawny, thin, lots of legs

Nose: caramel, butterscotch, wisps of nail polish remover 

Mouth: silky texture hits the tongue like water with a very distant hint of vanilla, followed by a blast of spice 

Finish: warm, then hollow... a tingling that makes one ask ""where the hell did all the flavor go?""... followed by a lingering aftertaste of shoeleather. 

Tldr; smells beautiful, sips super smooth, tastes surprisingly boring beyond the spicy tingle."
