4.0,"A slightly more refined version of the 101. Similar flavor profile, but seems a bit smoother, with a longer finish. Great aftertaste. 7/7/17"

3.0,Sweetness on the nose and follows through the palate. Some cinnamon spice and a little after burn towards the back end

5.0,"This stuff is under-rated.  Luckily, I live in Japan, where it is readily available.  It also costs about 3100 yen (a touch under $30) for a liter.  It's well-balanced.  It has notes of caramel, vanilla, prunes, tobacco, and leather.  I enjoy it year round.  I occasionally try more expensive bourbon, but I always return to Wild Turkey 8-year.  It would be delicious at any price."
3.0,Better than its reputation. Make sure you like rye before heading down the Wild Turkey path.

4.25,"Nose... Marshmallows, caramel, apricots and maple syrup just to name a few...

Color... A light to medium copper..

Taste.... Subtle rye, toasted almonds, seasoned wood, pepper, tobacco and raisins...

Overall... The higher proof, deep char and 6 to 8 years spent in the barrels gives this Bourbon such knockout flavors at a fantastic price.  It's bold, complex and yet totally refined, even to drink neat which is my style. Change the packaging and rename it, then double the price, and people will purchase more of it than they do now. It's a STEAL...."
2.5,"Decent at best. Not much better on ice, no flavors stand out."
4.0,"Nose - Vanilla caramels, oaky cinnamon, hints of fresh bing cherries & maraschino cherries, caramel macchiato foam.

Taste - Spicy cinnamon tingle, oaky vanilla caramel, sharp maraschino cherry sweet, hints of sweet wet tobacco

Finish - Lingering oaky cinnamon, vanilla caramels, cinnamon tingle lingers, oaky caramel

Score - 86/100

Final Thoughts - So this is pretty standard Wild Turkey to be honest. The 8 year age statement doesn't really make the standard 101 that much better but just keeps the standard profile that I enjoy about Wild Turkey. Nothing amazing, but just quality bourbon, although the finish is a bit more oaky than I remember but it's not distracting in any way.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes

Would I buy a bottle? - Yes"
