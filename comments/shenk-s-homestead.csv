4.5,"Nose- slight astringent, brown sugar, sweet tea. 
Body- This is great! Sweet fruit notes, brown sugar, sweet tea, and a bit of apple pie 
Finish- The sweet tea gives way to a clear and very nice sweet tobacco note. A first for me. 

Recommended by Jason at Bluegrass Tavern. Shit this is good!"
4.25,"Grassy, sweet, floral on the nose

Floral, peppery, hints of dark chocolate"

4.0,"1st dram notes from a 750ml bottle purchase...   color - nice golden amber/copper, nose:  it's bourbon and it's pronounced, not soft and it lingers for a long time.  Taste: Cherry, chocolate, vinalla, carmel… it's a candy bar of sorts...  Is this Willits or Noah's Mill?  I know it's bottled by Michter's from the label and I know it's made in KY, that's all I know for certain.    I like this dram a lot even if it's only 45% abv.  Medium finish.  I'll gladly polish this bottle off but at this price, I'll probably spend my money on others... 8/8/2019 update: at $69.99 it's a steal... I bought a second bottle!"

4.0,"2018 release - a better than average whiskey. not overly sweet but enough to keep the palate happy with a medium finish.

2019 release - recalibrated my taste buds for whiskey since this IS NOT a bourbon. it’s a sour mash whiskey. taste profile makes sense now. raising score to 4."
4.5,"Butterscotch, toffee vanilla and bubblegum on the nose. Possibly one of the smoothest whiskies I’ve ever had. A hint of spice and warmth. And it almost cleans it self off of the palate."
4.5,Carmel on nose and tongue. Punch of bourbon in back end.
4.5,"1/11/19 - I like the nose up front but the rest seems a little young and may need a little while to open up. I bet in a month or so this will really be nice.  The finish does linger, which is nice.

6.7/10 now, but could go up

UPDATE 2/25/19

Wow, this has really changed, for the better!  The nose is root beer-like that’s sweet, some vanilla and honey.  The palate is smooth with a little sting and the sweetness still present from the nose.  The finish is definitely delivers way better than before.  Less spice, root beer taste comes through with a end reminding you of the wood and heat for a slight hug. This got really, really good.  8.8/10"

Finish - candy apples- leather - weak finish."
4.5,"Citrus on the nose along with sweaty corn husk and a light toffee almost saltwater caramel toffee-esk. Amazingly tasty, not as hot as expected on the nose. This may be in my TOP 5 of all time at this point. Thank you, Ram!"
