3.75,"Initial caramel and butterscotch taste is great, the lingering burn and bitterness is the reason for a lower rating"

3.75,"Neat.  Some nice sweet high vanillas and low chocolate.  Floral and oak behind that.  Baking spice.  Nice smooth mouth feel.  Chocolate, spice, vanilla.  Little briny.  Solid but nothing too special."

3.0,"Nose: **acetone- fruity, woody, nail polish remover
Taste: ****more complex than the nose; baked red apples, cinnamon spice, clove, and honey with a medium-long finish
Value: **1/2 about on par for the proof and story but that’s it
Overall: ***"

5.0,Sweet aroma of honey and caramel. Taste is smooth. There is a lot of fruity notes with a hint of caramel. A long finish with a slight lingering burn.

3.0,"Vanilla caramel, Oak. A little spicy heat at the finish. It’s an ok pour but not my favorite"
2.5,"Overall, underwhelming. When you add the cost, extremely underwhelming!"

3.25,"Starts like Bourbon, Finishes like Rye

Begins with a full frontal assault of caramel, mingles with butterscotch, slight undertones of cedar and vanilla.  The rye grass and dill pickle arrive mid-palate, gradually taking over the finish with light baking spice on the tongue and the same dill pickle after taste.  Surprising to find so much rye influence in a bourbon, but sadly not very complex."

4.25,"Neat.  Open bottle for months.  I recall a bad first impression of this bottle.  It is either hitting me better today in general or something opened up.

On the nose, it is very bready and spice forward.  Clove, cinnamon, baking spices.  There is a hint of char and then behind that you can find the caramels and vanillas.

Creamy mouth feel with a ton of sweetness on the tongue.  Brown sugar and vanilla.  Hint of brine.  On the taste it is almost all caramels, raspberries, vanilla, pie crust.  Legs bring back that brine.  Dries out the mouth a bit more than expected for not being very tannic.

Time did this one a lot of favors.  It’s delightful.  Over priced still, but delightful."

4.5,"The cask strength appears to make a difference in this series, by far my favorite between voyages 16-19"
