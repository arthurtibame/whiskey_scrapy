2.5,"Smells like fresh squeezed apple juice. I like that. Full flavor across the pallet. The end is a little bit of plants and butter. Second sip was the same. I’m struggling to explain the primary flavor. It’s nutty, plants, butter, popcorn. Very unique. No peat, this isn’t a scotch. It’s all traditional whisky, that feels a lot like a bourbon. Third sip, more of the same. I wouldn’t buy a bottle, or a single. But I would accept a dram if a friend offered me one."
