4.25,light on pallette with fruit and burnt sugar.  fruit and sea salt in pallette with a quick finish.  nice
4.25,"Really nice, great floral and citrusy notes. Very different than what I normally would think of from a scotch. Right up there with the Talisker and Lagavulin in this series."

4.0,"I hope I can find another bottle of it. It’s a warming, comfortable, sit-by-the-fire whisky."
0.5,Much too spicy. The flavor profile for this needs to be completely readjusted by distiller. Nose was banana like?

4.25,"geur als boterwafeltjes snoepjes, volle smaak, pittige afdronk."
4.0,"Idk if it's the fact the I love Cask Strength whiskey but this does not drink like the description had me expect.

Well balanced start to finish. 

N: Mineral/honey sweet and light

P: Rich with nougat and sweet/honey fruit notes. 

F: lovely finish with the medium burn I want out of a Cask Strength. The sweet fruity notes linger but not so long that it over stays it welcome...you know like the Tyrrells."

4.0,"This is my first proper taste of this distillery and, yes, it’s waxy. There’s a distinct aroma of melting candle, but also a hint of perfume and bitter marmalade. Tastes of malt, tamarind, black tea and a hint of burnt match. Rich, oily, spicy. The aftertaste starts with a savory smoldering wax, then turns sweet. Whether you ignore or embrace the marketing, this is a balanced, intriguing whisky that demands your attention. You’ll definitely want more than one glass of this."

4.0,"On nose: sweet fruits and wax. Fresh. Palate: start lightly, banana (?). Great spice coming later on. Finish is waxy, sweet, with dominant spiciness.
4.0 because of the price, otherwise it would be 4.25 based on quality."
4.0,"★★★★
Ça manque de fleurs...
L'avant-dernier whisky de cette belle soirée. La maison Tyrell. On s'attendait à quelque chose de doux, de floral, de délicat. Et bien non! On est plus sur un scotch intense, flamboyant et tenace. J'aurais préféré voir ce whisky pour la maison Targaryen, mais bon, on l'aime pareil!"

4.25,"Fragrant fruit on the nose, with mango, pineapple and mandarin surrounded by caramel, hazelnut and wax. Let's throw some marshmellow and dried dates in between. Sweet and silky, with a hint of minerality, very round.
The mineral side is more evident on the palate, with a peppery push that makes the whisky more jaunty, reviving the sweet composure of tropical fruit, hazelnuts, biscuits and toffee. The alcoholic boost keeps the attention high, avoiding the risk of flat drinking.
The finish is medium-long, with hazelnuts, malt and a citrus touch.
The elegant signature of Clynelish clashes with the youth of the malt, but the end result defends itself all in all well, thanks also to the choice of full alcohol content which also makes it fun."
3.5,Honey palate after water more of a molasses taste.
3.5,"On the nose, I got buttered biscuits, honeysuckle, lemons/peaches, medium citrus fruits, slight spiciness – cinnamon, white grapes, with a pear on the back end...

For the palate, it is a lovely, heavy, waxy mouth coat. Drinks well neat, and not overpowering at cask strength. Wave of oranges, butter, ginger, black pepper, and red chilies.

Decent, but short, dry finish with more of the wax with a bitter rind. White pepper, and orange marmalade. Well balanced overall.

After a couple drops of water, the nose had tobacco, tea, and leather. The palate brought out additional notes of cream, buttery toffee, and caramel. The waxy factor diminishes a little.

3.5 out of 5. Not a beginner’s whisky. It is worth it at regular price, but not worth the secondary market prices, unless you bought it to resale.

The theme to this dram is ""John the Fisherman"" by Primus. Chunky but gooooooood."

3.75,"Palate: Waxy, full body flavor with plenty of spice. Subtle hit of peat, mild fruit/herbs, with an aftertaste of tobacco (to me). Good flavor, but not something I’m going to chase down too often."

2.5,"Was hoping for Margery Tyrell: robust, vivacious, can win you over with a smile.  Instead, it’s Loras Tyrell: very much forgettable.  It’s got the classic waxy feel of Clyneish, but just seems imbalanced.  Hot at first, then suddenly this mossy taste, then hot again.  Thanks to @Richard-ModernDrinking for the generous pour.  I’ve been meaning to try the GoT bottlings, and I can knock one more off my list.  Thanks again !"

3.5,"Courtesy of AT - Strong spice, and heavier at cask strength. Overall good installment from Clynelish."

4.0,Smells a little toasty and definitely sweet. Light body. Warm finish that holds its own for a decent little bit of time.
4.5,"Honey, floral, get a little spice, light on the nose"
