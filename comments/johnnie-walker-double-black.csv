2.0,Good whisky but too expensive. Not as smoky as others
3.0,"Nose: pecans, burnt wet leaf smoke, sawdust, overripe melon.

Palate: cola, minty-menthol, cereal. 

Finish: fresh bitter burst, a little sweetish smoke, followed by a weirdly chemical sensation that coats the mouth and throat like that supermarket-brand cola aftertaste.

Conclusion: this is a decently tasty blend, but really does not deliver on its promise of intense, rich smoke. The smoke that’s present is kind of watery and definitely lacks the punch of a fill-blooded Islay or Island scotch. The presence of (presumably young) grain whisky is also noticeable, every other sip betraying a little woody acetone. All said, it’s a solid blend but I’d say the regular JW Black is better balanced. At least it keeps my dad away from my Highland Park 12. 

Score: 74"

4.0,"This whisky is an ode to Man, by Man. This is a construction. 

It's not the nectar that the gods of whisky gave to men by some happy combination of clear water, magnificent barley or some other specificities that gave whisky its personality and sense of a place. 

No...oh, no. This is the work of Man, creating the drink the Man wanted, getting it as close as possible to His dreams.

Its appearance, body and feeling are wanted, created. 

Now, I know that the purists like to get lost into the mist of a non chill filtered, no color added whisky, the slow descending tears of a cask strength, to travel and explore places with their senses.

But Johnnie Walker Double Black is not a whisky intended to do that. It is made to be your everyday go to whisky, from price point to ABV. It is a whisky made to interpret what people THINK what whisky should be, and not let people interpret the whisky, offering them on a plate an easy translation of their thoughts into reality. 

And this is the key I chose for  this whisky. 

It is a whisky that I will always have in my home, it is a whisky I will always have when trying to unwind without giving  it too much thought or attention. I will just enjoy it.

PS: Don't add water. It will significantly subdue its aromas.
PS 2: due to its made up fabric it is consistent from the first to the last dram of the bottle, bottle to bottle.


Appearance: color - amber, clarity - very clear, viscosity - nice legs on the glass but rather thin, wine-like. 
Nose: light, sweet, medicinal, smoky, a hint of sherry, brine
Taste: sweet, woody, creamy 
Finish: enough length, hint of smokiness and maltiness 
Body: well rounded, balanced"

Taste notes: watery mouth feel. Almost cool, but does begin to leave a subtle warmth after swallowing. Mostly a smokey and tart flavor, but it’s major thing going for it is how smooth it is. Goes down like water, but overall flavor is not complex and needs more tasting to come closer to identifying the subtler tastes."

This tasting was done under the influence of the man flu... mostly for medicinal purposes.

Yellow-golden in color with medium-light body.  The nose is peat, peat, Oceanside bar-b-q and a bit of pungent sweetness (reminds me of dark agave) with floral and leather notes pulling things oddly together.  Makes the sinuses feel better so far.

There’s a tingle on the tongue with lots of smoke and charcoal up front - not spice so much, maybe ethanol?  The back of the tongue picks up bitter orange, oak and the agave-like sweetness again.  The finish is dry and short.

Would I buy it myself?  No.  Will I sleep better tonight?  Only time will tell but all signs point toward yes."

2.75,"Finally gave in to my curiosity and decided to try this whisky. Well, we all know what curiosity did to the cat. Fortunately, I haven’t suffered that fate, but I am pretty disappointed. 

JW Double Black is a 40% peated blend. While the standard Black carries a 12 year age statement, this bottle does not. It’s a medium gold in the glass and produces quick skinny legs with no noticeable water. 

On the nose there’s lightly smoked floral barley. There’s no alcohol, but also no noticeable grain. Nothing bad, but not too memorable either. 

The palate is just nothing. There’s a light, barely there sweetness and not much smoke. Lets call a spade a spade: it’s bland. Again, nothing objectionable, but nothing good either.

The finish is the only thing that saves this dram from being completely wasted. There’s a nice ashy BBQ smoke that lingers for quite a while. Overall, this was very disappointing. At $44 for a 750 ml bottle, it’s about 25% more than the standard Black label. Just not worth it. Average rating here on Distiller is 3.4. I’ll give it 3/5, minus a quarter point for value. 2.75/5. Cheers!"
2.0,"“The Smokey Johnnie” indeed. There’s smoke alright, but not “The Power of Islay” as their advertising suggests. More like a faint, ashy whimper. 

Apart from that, tastes just like JW Black. Was pretty good with some fresh baked chocolate chip cookies. On that front, I can highly recommend Scotch & Cookies as a fine adult snack on a rainy Saturday afternoon. Cheers!"

Finish: a hint of oak and a tad of smoke. 

I guess, if you mix a highland park with a bit of Lagavulin and water, you’re there. ;p

Easy to drink. More interesting than the red, black and blue and rather inexpensive. (Around 26€ per 70ml if you source right). Still wouldn’t buy, but a good alternative at simple bars"
4.5,Probably one of my favorite whiskeys hands down.
3.0,"This is a lightly peated dram if you like Ardbeg and Laphroiag.  There is a hint of smoke on the nose, which is otherwise a pleasant scotch nose.

The palate strikes me as sweet, changing to a nice middle of the road scotch (malted barley) with a trace of peat on the finish.

For some this might be a smokey, peaty scotch, but not if you enjoy the peatier options out there.  Still a very good scotch and maybe a good way to introduce someone to peat."

There is some smoke here, but it's not like peated Islay smoke.  I think that the char comes through more than the smoke.  There is cereal malt, but the most prominent flavors are burnt brown sugar, burnt marshmallows.  There is a bit of sweetness again, like malted barley syrup.

The finish is mostly the charred barrel notes.

All in all, pretty decent, but I would love it if this were a bit more complex."

3.25,"Fairly soft aroma with just a hint of caramel. Flavor is slightly sweet and smoky. The peat comes through a bit more on the finish. Water balances it out a bit. Overall nice, but not the complexity of some of the older scotch’s."

2.75,"Nose - Subtle sweet smoke, sweet dark tea, light apple sweet, not much there

Taste - More sweet smoke, clean grainy sweetness, apple juice sweet, light ginger spice

Finish - Light peppery heat/tingle, grainy clean sweetness, light smoke

Score - 65/100

Final Thoughts - So not as ""smoky"" as I thought but then again this is still meant to please the masses. This is quite boring from start to finish, but not unpleasant. Fairly boring, tame, meant to be mixed into a highball or drank ""on the rocks"" when there's nothing else better.

Would I drink it if offered? - No

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

4.25,Peaty and smoky but not so much as Laphroaig is.  Decent blend for the price.
3.25,"Nose - sweet peat smoke, caramel, honey, brine, mustiness, moderate ethanol burn. 

Taste - sweet smoke, sea salt, caramel, vanilla, burnt wood.

Pretty good, but I don’t like the burnt flavor from the extra charred casks."

4.25,"Smoky on the nose, specially if you smell the bottle once opened. Then i lost the smoke in the glass and got Vainilla and a little caramel on the nose. on the palate is sweet at first, very sweet caramel and then at the finish you get a bitter kick, but is very short. Very oaky. 88 over 100."

4.25,"Full flavored blend that’s very enjoyable. Very little ethanol taste, extremely smooth. Slight fruity, organic earthy flavor. Smokey oakey goodness and peat delight.  More pronounced Smokey peat than single black. Low heat that lingers for a bit makes for a perfect finish. Very nice on a cool day. Mr. Walkers blenders are true masters."

3.25,"Right away the nose hits you with a smokiness and it took me to a campfire memory along with dark chocolate and raisins. The taste definitely has some of the campfire as well as a little chocolate and plump sweetness under the campfire. The finish is light. It's not a go to for me because of the the nose but, it does catch my attention. Continue to drink whiskey/whisky! 😁   btw I love how idiots give a shit rating without any explanation. I wasn't a big fan of this but, there are some interesting things about it. Most likely won't buy again but, won't give a shit ass rating without an explanation."

3.25,"Yet another stop along my way of tasting inexpensive blends.  I really like Monkey Shoulder for cocktails, but wondered if there was something else that might be better.   So I got together a list of relatively inexpensive scotch - all blends - to taste my way through.  For the record, this experiment bounds the upper end at the price of the MS. So far I've had Dewar's White Label (I'm a long time drinker), Johnnie Walker Red (just say ""no""), Johnnie Walker Black (made me stop drinking Dewar's White Label), and Famous Grouse (same league as JW Red, so same answer).  I've had others (J&B, Teachers, Haig & Haig, and probably a dozen more), but not in anything like a recent period of time where I might feel comfortable providing a comparison.  Since I like bolder flavors and a bit of smoke, this JW might be a good fit for me.  Let's see...

Fresh bottle, first pour into a glencairn neat.  Allowed to sit for about 5 minutes to rest. Kind of an orange-brass pour.   Some sheeting on a swirl, minor slow tears.  The nose is bactine anseptic, alcohol, iodine, some peat, a bit of vanilla, a trace of plums.  It smells like a slightly amped up JWBL.  

This is nicely tame, slightly peaty and smoky, sweet with honey and vanilla on first taste.  Nothing too complex.  But if I wanted to know what the essence of a smoky, peaty scotch is like without heading to single malts, this is a great outline.  

There's a bit of length to the finish.  There's a tinge of sour or bitter on the back end (could be me at this moment) but otherwise this is a pretty predictable whisky.  If you don't like this, you likely don't like any Islay scotch. 

This is solid.  This is a good candidate for a Rob Roy (I want a bigger trace of smoke than MS provides in that cocktail) or a Blood & Sand, I think.  I like it.

My ratings put a good, mass market nothing special whisky at 2.5 - right at the peak of the bell curve.  Any quality offering is most likely to place between 2.0 and 3.0.  Above 3.0 we get into what I consider a better class of liquor.  Above 4.0 lies the range of true all-stars.  

This is a dram that doesn't make it that far, but I think it's fair to say its a little above average.  I like it, but I don't like it too much more than I like the regular JWB. Bottom line, I don't like this over regular Black enough to pay a premium. This is a push, taste is maybe a *little* more rich, definitely a bit more sweet, but the price is *noticeably* higher by 20%.  I won't buy another, but I'm satisfied with the bottle I got. If given the option this might be a good choice to sample at your local drinkery.  YMMV."

3.75,I can only confirm what’s already said plenty of times about this whisky: it’s good value for money if you like smoke! Smokey sweetness wrapped in a smooth blanket that will keep you warm for a while even after your last sip. But I find it more challenging to find individual flavors. I guess that confirms this is a good blend and I can only appreciate the skill it takes to create this same flavor consistently for each bottling. No bad words for this very enjoyable scotch.
