1.0,"Until trying this whiskey i never thought there was a thing as bad whiskey. Thank you for proving me wrong. Throw this back in the barrell for a couple years and hope something, anything else happens."
3.0,"Sit back and prepare to be knuckledusted in the mouth by the malt in this fiery young spirit. Heady, bready grain notes compete with milk chocolate and his coach coffee in a knock down, drag out outdoor brawl that leaves you shouting with excitement even as you don't know who to root for. Given some further aging to take the raw edge off I can't wait to see how these fighters come out swinging later in their careers. In the mean time this is one of the most interesting matchups I've seen in ages."
