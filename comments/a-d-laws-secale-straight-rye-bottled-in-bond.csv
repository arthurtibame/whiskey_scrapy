5.0,"Although I live in Canada, i was planning a trip to Colorado and was therefore calling some liquor stores in Denver to see if they had a couple of whiskies that we can't get in Canada. 
   Although they didn't have the ones I was seeking, the salesman told me about A.D Laws whiskey (which had won the 2017 award for best rye whisky in the world).  He told me it was the best rye he had ever tasted and that it was currently only available in Colorado (where it is made).  After confirming his recommendation with a little internet research I resolved to drive straight from the Denver airport to pick up a couple of bottles of this stuff (because it's even hard to come by in Colorado).
  
  This is indeed very good rye.  I find it hard to pick out all the little nuances of the flavour profile.  I would describe it as thick, but also very smooth.  Most true ryes (>90% rye grain) have much more spicey bite to them, but this one is very smooth with a flavour that reminds me of leather (but in a good way).  I'm going to have to make this stuff last because it will likely be a long time before I have the opportunity to buy it again, but I will savour it every time."

3.5,"Very smooth and approachable for a bonded whiskey. Oak and vanilla flavors. Good, standard American whiskey profile."
3.75,An oakey nose with a youthful rye mouthfeel.  The taste is spicy and oakey.  white pepper coats the mouth but appears as an remaining note.  There is a subtle sweetness with each sip but the peppery rye is the dominant influence
3.0,"Cinnamon and a bit spicy , warm almost like Jameson"

4.5,"Very unique nose, not the same spices as most Rye. Definitely get the Orange combined with an earthy black tea. Signature honey/granola from Laws. Well balanced with enough bite."

5.0,"Tawny port color with a silky, moderately oily palate. Mint, butterscotch, and baking spice on the nose. Mint, honey, and slight medicinal bitterness on the palate. Great lingering rye finish!"

3.75,Biscuit and honey flavored with up front flavor with less back taste
4.0,Very pleasant Rye. Nose is sweet grainy with wood present. That nice rye burn starts the taste but there is also some grain and sweetness like a biscuit with honey.  Wood is also present which continues into the finish. The a very pleasant bitterness to the wood. The finish is not overly long and the whiskey is not as complex as others but differently closer to a 5 than a 4.
4.0,Floral honey nose with a spice sweet mouth

2.5,"It has a rich nose, almost like Campbelltown or island Scotch. It immediately has a rich taste that avoids the usual vegetal and medicinal cliches, tasting meaty before tasting like rotten vegetation. It's a unique experience in that regard. I adore the richness but I feel like it could have hit some better notes. There is some gross bread flavor that takes the forefront here, masking some nice chocolate and subtle caramel notes. Some nuttiness hangs out there too. There are some strong toasted wood flavors that are quite tasty. The rotten flavors quickly drop out, making gross bread the only major remaining problem. Smoke appears for sure, but not to an overwhelming extent. The fruity notes on the finish make for a nice ending. They tend toward rich redness like dark cherries. I wish the mint weren't here. The spices pack a bit of punch, but cinnamon is not a prominent as allspice and corriander. There is even a little bit of a tea flavor. This is probably the most sippable gross bread drink I have had because of its great complexity, but the gross bread keeps all of the pieces from quite coming together."

4.0,"Warm, spicy, bread, coy."
3.5,"A copper color and thick semi-watery legs are the visual for this Bottled-in-Bond rye.

The nose has complexity and notes of dry straw, heavy dill, black pepper, juniper, overripe apple, and banana.

The palate has a creamy mouthfeel and notes of BBQ, baking spices especially cardamom, and melon.

There’s a long lingering finish with a fennel and pepper note ending the experience. Cheers, Laws!"

4.25,"A truly outstanding spirit! The nose is very subtle with refined hints of grain and maybe a touch of cantaloupe. The palate rewards with everything I look for: pepper, a slight sweet honey, and the depth that comes with a higher proofed spirit. Honey and apple play with you until the end. Sadly, these few drops conclude the journey of this bottle for me. Will surely look for it in the future."
