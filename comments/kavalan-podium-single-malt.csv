5.0,"Nose - Bright crisp tropical fruits, starfruit (carombola), madagascar vanilla, toasted coconut, very nice & floral.
Taste - Nice fruity/floral sweetness and spice, tropical honey syrup, ""green"" fruits like crisp green apples, green grapes, a little thin on the mouthfeel, white peppercorn spice, hint of fresh berries.
Finish - Lingering white pepper spice, quickly fades, hint of lightly bitter/sour tropical fruits.
Score - 91/100
Final Thoughts - So I'm pleasantly surprised by this offering. It has a fantastic tropical/floral nose that I think I could nose for days. The taste is quite nice, albeit a bit thin and fades fairly quickly. For some reason I imagine this would be great to sip on while relaxing on a tropical beach somewhere on vacation."

4.0,"A wonderful dram with strong notes of tropical fruits, like mango and papaya. And though a tad harsh on the finish, the lightly toasted barley, vanilla, and honey on the palate makes this whisky a worthy item in any serious collection."

3.5,This one definitely grows on you.  Vanilla and tropical blend as Joe C noted. Was harsh to begin with but improved over time. I'd say 3.5 - 3.75

3.0,"Nose: vanilla, bread, dried fruit

Palate: viscous mouthfeel, syrupy but not coyingly so. Notes of dried fruit and bread continue here with oak and leather fading in. 

Medium drying finish of leather and oak. 

Certainly enjoyable, would happily pay $60/bottle. At $100/liter at the duty free, worth the purchase to experience it. Not sure yet if I’d buy another one."

3.75,Spicy rich and vanillic. Had this one from a miniature out in the cold so maybe it did taste extra good
