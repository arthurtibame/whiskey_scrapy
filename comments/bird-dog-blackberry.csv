1.0,"Rather medicinal. Strong alcohol flavor, sweet, with blackberries. This is on the nose as well as the palate. Glad I got it for free, and that it was only a small sample."

2.5,Definitely can taste the blackberry and it is definitely sweet. There’s no bite to the whiskey. Great mixed with iced tea or as a dessert whiskey. Drinkable but won’t win any awards on complexity.

3.25,I enjoy this neat or with a little tea. It is a little sweet but the blackberry is nice. Smooth going down

3.0,"You need to understand that this isn’t a fine bourbon or a scotch; it’s a $14 bottle of whiskey and you get what you pay for. This isn’t a whiskey you put in a Glencairn and sip slowly; mix it with some Coke and it’s a inoffensive, fruity mixed drink. If you look at it from that perspective, it’s a great whiskey. If you try and sip it and expect it to be as deep and complex as Laphroaig or Makers 46, you’ll be disappointed. A good, cheap whiskey for when you want to get a good buzz in a very easy-to-drink way."
2.0,Way too sweet

1.0,"This is really foul stuff. Only to be found in single-shotters to prevent dose-dependent toxicity, it reeks of artificial berry and tastes of the same with a buttery finish that is hard to wipe off the tongue even after several cold hard swishes of Diet Coke."
2.25,Not very good

2.75,After trying the Bird Dog Peach whiskey I was excited to try this but I was disappointed with the Blackberry whiskey. Now the whiskey on its own is not bad but the berry flavor is quite subtle and vanishes when you add ice or water to it. I think this may be good on desserts as a syrup or on ice cream but not as a regular sipper. If you want an outstanding flavored whiskey to try the Peach whiskey from Bird Dog it is outstanding.
