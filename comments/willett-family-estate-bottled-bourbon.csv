5.0,"14 year, Barrel 8o8, 63.3%, 17/134. Smells of deep honey and caramel. Surprisingly, there's a malt note. On the palate, a bit sharp, but full. The deep caramel carries over. A bit of a nutty aftertaste. Delicious. 8/23/17
21 years, Barrel C13A, 145 proof, ""Red Eye."" Stings on the nose. Doesn't drink as hot as you would think. Great pour. Wood, vanilla, brown sugar, nutmeg and cinnamon. Some zest. Long finish. 5 stars. 8/23/17
5-yr. Initially the nose was thin but it opened up after a few minutes. Some honey, wood, and slight brine and mustiness. Cinnamon sugar on the palate. Not as deep as some of the older WFE I've had but the layers are there. Good level of flavorful spice, just the right amount of heat, pleasant wood, and medium sweetness. Good stuff. 9/13/17
23 year, 67% abv, barrel 296, bottle 4/100. Deep caramel, oak, fruit on the nose. Wow on the palate. Great spice, sweetness, heat, all three notes linger. Hint of fruit that was on the nose pops up again on the finish. Not too oaky. This kills. 10/16/17

14 years, 124.2 proof, barrel no. 1419, ""Piloncillo"" bottle (91/94) at Jack Rose. Syrupy nose, deep sugars. Fragrant. Sweet and intense on the palate. Sharp and creamy at the same time. Wood and spice that lingers, with bitterness. The sharp wood notes are a bit too strong for my liking. 3 stars. 10/18/18"

A mature bouquet of browned butter, roasted nuts, leather, fluffy vanilla, and dry wood. Seriously spicy palate with brown sugar and mint syrup folded in. The wood dominates the finish with extracted tannins and soaked wood. Breathe deeply and the heat will radiate through your chest."

This redefined what I thought bourbon could and should be. 

Nose is fruit, oak, herbal, and sweet. 

Mouth is rich, sweet, oily, and the flavors continue on and on and on. Fig, plum, raisins, almost a molasses sweetness, apple, cherry. 

Finish... my god, it lasts forever. The spice comes through gently. No heat, no burn, just smooth flavor for days. 

A+ bourbon. Second to none... including the Pappy 23."

4.75,"Nose- Cherry! Sweet and a bit sour. Remind me of the rev cherry syrup for snow cones. 
Body- Good lord! This is a cherry bomb and I love it. There is a nice presence of black sugar and a peppery spice as well. 
Finish- Cherry, tobacco, and sweet tea continue. This one really costs the mouth with a reach tannin mouthfeel with just a hint of mint. 

Note- I loved this! It was rich and easy enough to drink straight although it really opened up with a few drops of water. This was a six year old barrel puck chosen by the Silver Dollar Houston Bourbon Consortium."
4.25,"Nose: butter, raw fruit juice.

Palate: entry is one of the best and unique Iv had! It burns on entry at FIRST and smooths out into a fantastic melody of sugar daddy’s, black cherries, strawberry, lemon, melon, and watermelon bubble gum. 

Finish: mother f#"

Neck pour in Norlan, sitting for 15 minutes. Splash of water. 

Sticky sweet honey and vanilla up front. Big notes of cherry and orange zest, dark chocolate, nougat, nutmeg and cinnamon each meld beautifully with each other. Cherry cola notes linger as well. Very seamless nose if not a little tame for the proof .

Honey and vanilla jump out first followed by notes of fruity pastry. Think pear and cherry tart with orange whipped cream. But before these sweet notes take over, you get a nice hit of oak char and pumpkin pie spice. Mouthfeel is superb with great viscosity and weight with less burn than anticipated. 

What stands out most to me in this bourbon is the finish, dominated by chocolate malted milk balls, vanilla, and orange zest that goes on for minutes. Absolutely stellar and memorable. 

First WFE, quite impressed with all they packed in this bottle in 6+ years."

4.25,"I had this beauty a couple of weeks ago. I really liked it and that is no standard thing since rye whiskies are not my cup of tea. Lots of red fruits on the nose, specially strawberry. On the palate is very sweet with a lot of bite, its spicyness of pepper, clove and ginger is very balanced with the sweetness. Even its color is beautiful. Quite a nice dram. 85/100."
