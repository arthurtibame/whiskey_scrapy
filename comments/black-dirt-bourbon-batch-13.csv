1.75,"Unbelievably bad. Bought a case as usual when a new batch hits the streets. Opened two bottles and no difference. Way off guys! The first 12 batches have been enjoyable. That aroma and mouthfull of hay and the sweetness of cut grass is awesome. Everyone would enjoy the first 12. The 14,well great, now quite back to par. Again hoping that batch 15 brings things back inline with what we love about a product that starts from the great soil of the region."
