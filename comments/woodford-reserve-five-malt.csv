3.75,"This has been growing on me since I first tried it. The sweetness on the corn and complexity on the malt given the low age is impressive. Great nose and lingering finish. If you like this, try Jimmy Red Corn (Highwire) as well."

4.0,"I get why many don't enjoy it, but it's pretty good, for a nearly woodless whiskey. The malt and corn flavor really come through, and it's quite sweet with a slight bite. Don't know if I'd buy it, but interesting."
