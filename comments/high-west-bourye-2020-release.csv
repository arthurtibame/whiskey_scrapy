3.5,This is a fun blend of bourbon and rye. Paired with dark chocolate it’s a tasty combo. A little steep on price but it’ll grow on you.
4.25,"Nose: Butter, vanilla, banana
Neat: Ginger spiced, cinnamon, vanilla, banana 
Rocks: One ice cube seemed to really take the taste away leaving a slight taste of vanilla and banana"
3.25,"Did not have a lot of flavor or character for me.  Spicy, some vanilla.  Peppery finish. Smooth, easy sipping. I was expecting more for the cost."

3.25,"Unimpressive for the cost. Label and website say all 10 year old for the blend. Unsure of the year otherwise. No reference to rye. Maybe I misunderstand. Very spicy. Good body. Some vanilla, some fruit. Maybe citrus. Indistinguishable, sadly. Hard to pull apart flavors. Long finish, but same problem - hard to separate. Wouldn't buy again."

4.5,"Neat.  Neck pour of 2020.  Never had Boureye before this but knowing it was a blend of old MGP intrigued me.  Surprising amount of orange zest on the nose followed by vanilla.  The bourbon side comes out the longer I sit with it, caramel and baking spices.    Cinnamon roll with icing is becoming more predominant too.  Keeps bouncing between the rye and bourbon side, that is pretty neat and balanced!

Bit thin in the palate.  Cinnamon and brown sugar sweetness up front, then hits you strong with that orange and rye spice.  This orange is surprisingly strong.  Just like the nose, the bourbon side starts coming out the longer you are with it.  Vanilla, caramel, and light oak.

This is fun!  Other than the texture being a bit thin, I liked the rest of the experience.  Lives up to the name as it bounces between Rye and Bourbon qualities."
