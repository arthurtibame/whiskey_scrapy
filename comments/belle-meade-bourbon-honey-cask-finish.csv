4.0,Classic mgp profile. Faint honey flavor that balances well with the overall profile. High proof hides a lot of the honey.
4.25,"Honey and sweetness on the nose. More on the palate. First sip is good, thick, coats the mouth. Very rich. Has some sweet heat. Sweetness takes over even more the more you drink limiting how much you can have of this. Definitely a dessert drink"
3.75,2020 batch 3 100 proof. Thick sweet and a good bite at the end. The honey sticks around for a good long finish. I’d prefer one with a little less honey forward punch.
4.5,"Tried batch 3 2020 bottle 57. Thick mouth feel. Splash of honey initially followed by some heat with a light honey finish. Very unique, super long legs on the glass. Bought a 1 oz sample for $25"
null,Sweet tea burn. In a good way.
4.25,"Reviewing the 2019 release (111.8 proof)

So what exactly is all the hype about? Let's dive into what's in the bottle:

Belle Meade gave used 11 year Belle Meade single barrel bourbon barrels to Trubee Honey. Trubee Honey filled these bourbon barrels with local wildflower honey, and after dumping the honey, returned the barrels to Belle Meade. Belle Meade then refilled the barrels with 11 year old high rye bourbon (30% rye) again and let them rest for a few months before finally bottling the bourbon.

So what does it taste like? Let's dive in:

It enters hot and very thick and mouthcoating! The rich natural honey sweetness is immediately evident with a vanilla and cinnamon a fast follow. A big array of baking spices follow with honey in the background it's a lovely combination of sweet and spice with a good amount of heat. A very decadent experience! Very unique and a perfect desert dram. 

Cheers all!"
5.0,"113.6 Proof (2018 release)

Nose- Tropical fruits, wild flowers, caramel, honey, lemon, wet wood, baking spices, apples, lavender

Palate- Sweet honey, cinnamon dusted apples, orange candies, oak, lavender, caramel

Finish- Thick, chewy mouthfeel with a long finish of honeysuckle, baking spices and a sort of floral- lavender flavor

An absolute delight. Belle Meade absolutely nailed the balance between not enough and too much honey when aging this bourbon. The nose fantastic, with the highlights being (of course) honey, tropical fruits, and wild flower smell that reminds me of the very orchard the bees are from. The palate blew me away. Perfect balance of honey, spice, and floral flavors. The mouth feel on this really feels like a bourbon aged in a honey barrel. Thick, chewy and delicious. The bourbon coats your mouth and sticks to it (just like... you guessed it, honey) and leaves a long finish that is to die for. Truly one of the best bourbons i’ve ever tried. Bravo."
