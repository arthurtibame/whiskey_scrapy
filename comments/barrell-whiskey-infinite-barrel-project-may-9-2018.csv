4.25,"OMGosh the nose!!!! It's milky chocolate, it's slightly nutty, it's has warm vanilla and maple (not like Angel's Envy Rum finished Rye)...to quote Seth Rogen in pineapple express, ""I want to live in here""

P: light Cherry, Spice and a slight fruitiness, does have some heat to it. Peppery Rye notes also present.

F: The spice and heat from the back pallete lead. Spice continues to linger with a slight sweetness but alot. Smooth like a Cask Strength, hahaha.

In short the complexity is real. Interested to see future iterations and compare. Must try."
