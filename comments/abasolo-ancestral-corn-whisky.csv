2.5,"Exceptionally unique! 

The nose is dominate by an aroma in unfamiliar with, but I’ll try to describe it as roasted sweet corn with movie theatre butter and salted caramel. On the palate it’s much more subdued with corn/agave sweetness rising over soft caramel and vanilla. Hints of banana and tropical fruits poke through on occasion. The finish is a quick decrescendo that fails to leave a lasting impression."
