4.5,"Nose - (w/o water) Floral honey, dark apple juice, golden raisins (w/ water) Adds an additional component of a vanilla custard with a tiny hint of lemon zest

Taste - (w/o water) Rich floral honey, dark apple juice, hints of vanilla, nice light cinnamon heat/tingle, dark golden raisins (w/ water) Adds an additional component of pleasant citrusy notes, more floral, more creamy custard & more rich mouthfeel

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering warm fruity tingle, pleasant dark apple juice with grape & vanilla caramel undertones (w/ water) Makes the finish less sweet but more fruity & floral, more ""bright"" fruit and quite pleasant

Score - 90/100

Final Thoughts - This is a very well put together Speyside dram that is just very well put together from start to finish. Simple flavors done very well with zero off putting notes and actually is a lot more balanced/nuanced with a tiny bit of water added. It really opens up with a few drops of water to reveal citrus & cream that were previously hidden. This is quite delicious and really highlights what this distillery was capable if aged nicely for 28 years.
