3.75,"I took a chance on this bottle I found at Total Wine and I was presently surprised. 

The nose has flowers, raisins, toffee, and hazelnut, but the main aroma is a sweet cola smell. 

The palate is very sweet with rose water and dried fruit. You can taste that this scotch is younger than other Speyside single malts. You pick up more flavor from the distillate and less from the cask compared to something like Macallan. The finish is medium in length and spicy.

I tried this side by side with Macallan double cask and it has some similarities, but it is definitely younger and sweeter. This bottle is a good value for a NCF and natural color scotch, and a good choice for Speyside fans or to introduce someone to scotch."
