4.5,"I was given a sample from a friend. I'm usually a scotch fan, but this was delicious. It's complex and unique. Cloyingly sweet and sticky with a wonderful mouthfeel. This 6 yo is a perfect ABV to deliver the layers of flavors in this wonderful dram. I get cherry, chocolate, honey, molasses, sugar, vanilla, toffee, raisins, and even a hint of mocha. Westland single cask 2542 was a perfect dessert whisky tonight and comes highly recommend."
4.5,Just tasted some of this at the distillery. Really heavy sherry influence with a lingering finish of raspberry jam. Really really good!
