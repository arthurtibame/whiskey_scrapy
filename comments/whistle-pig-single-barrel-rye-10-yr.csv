5.0,"Extremely tasty! Good spice throughout but not overbearing! Great single barrel pick by S&V in Fort Wayne, IN."
4.0,Rye heavy (expected).  Good but I wouldn’t pay what it costs for a 750.
4.5,"I found a store pick, barrel proof MGP aged 13 years 8 months. At 118 proof, this is an exceptional rye. I can't speak for the Alberta distillate, but if you find MGP you'll know it."

4.0,"Barrel select for Virginia ABC, Barrel #85200 (WH 1, Rick D, Level 3), 109.2 proof.

Neat in Glencairn at home.  Nose has brite and fruity spices, some apples and apricot, even a hint of peach.  Touch of alcohol comes on at the end.  Interesting.  Taste is similarly more brite and fruit-forward than I had expected. Some rye spice does come through the midrange, and the finish has a lingering mild and pleasant sweet spice.  I quite like this.  3/27/2020."

4.0,"Proof: 105.7

Appearance: Rich Maple

Nose: Caramel, Rye, Black Pepper

Taste: Maple, Rye, Honey

Finish: Rye, Clove, Spicy"
4.25,"Neat. Neck pour. Ohio Rich Pig.  Nose is very interesting.  Strong cereal and rye bread.  Slight vanilla.  Black pepper.  Cinnamon covered pear.  Proof will catch up to you (118) if you aren’ careful.  Transitioning into maple covered pancakes even.

Nice creamy, oily feel.  Brown sugar and honey on the tongue.  Transitions to a big rye blast which lingers on the legs.  The finish brings in a nice vanilla and baking spice. Little hint of dill at the front on subsequent sips.

I can see why this one in the series is called “Rich Pig.”  The flavors on the taste are very dense and pronounced. It’s a very delicious rye. I believe I have had better Whistle Pig Single Barrels though.  Could be an unfair comparison being this is a neck pour.  If this one does improve with a little time on the shelf, it has a chance to be special."

4.5,"Full flavor with baking spice, oaky spice, clove caramel with a nice long finish. Other ryes can pack a punch but lack this complexity. I love this one. My benchmark favorite rye actually"
