3.0,"This is a good whiskey. In a lot of ways it tastes like a less smooth version of Crown Royal. Obviously both are Canadian whiskey. But Black Velvet is incredibly affordable. To me it has a predominant vanilla flavor with one hell of a bite. There is an odd, amost tar-like undertone that you wouldn't experience with a higher quality whiskey and it has a ""flat soda"" note. It's not perfect and the Black Velvet reserve puts standard Black Velvet to shame. But there's no shame in drinking one of the top 10 best selling whiskeys in the world."

3.0,"Yes, it has burnt caramel/maple syrup overtones. Yes it's a bit rye sweet and mild for the ""new, cool shaped bourbon bottle of the month"" crowd. If bourbon is your thing then no- you're not going to go into fits of ecstasy over BV. Of course the scotch drinkers are rolling their eyes, convinced that you will go blind and insane from Makers Mark. You take water, add grain, stir it good with your athletes foot infested tootsies, distill it down and put it in a wood barrel for years. Hello whisky (or whiskey if you need to..). Pour it, mix it, blend it, take it straight. Just do it responsibly."

0.75,More like cough syrup than whiskey.  Have to let it sit a while in ice to smooth it out.

2.0,Very light flavor. Not much on the nose. Slight sweetness with a light oak flavor. Very heavy burn in the mouth. Very meh. Would get list in a mix and doesn’t bring much to the table.

2.25,"Shockingly not the worst thing ever. Comparing it to similar Canadians in its price range, like Canadian Mist and Canada House, Black Velvet is by far the most palatable, primarily because it doesn’t give me the sensation of choking on a mouthful of corn dust. Bog standard and plain as a board, but not altogether unpleasant at the end of the day."
1.0,Terrible strong alcohol flavor like they added whiskey flavoring to vodka.

1.0,"This has a richer, smokier nose than Ellington does (though there still isn't much to it). The palate is smooth with a viscous mouthfeel and immediately too much artificial caramel flavor. It's surprisingly drying though. There really isn't much happening on this palate. It really just tastes like a young whiskey that I wouldn't want to drink. It isn't the worst thing out there, but it's far, far from good. It might be possible to hide it in a drink, but it really is painful to sip. Ugh, drinking Ellington after this is a huge mistake - awful! Ellington Reserve is even worse! Somehow, this is better than the both of them.
It tastes young with some sweetness and not much going on. It has alcohol and gross caramel. Ellington is more interesting, but has some more explicitly gross flavors, almost like some tequila got mixed in."

1.25,"Poured neat because I seem to have lost all self respect. Smell is reminiscent of butterscotch, coconut sun screen, and imminent regret. Taste is surprisingly sweet with whisps of wood smoke that quickly fades to heavily charred brussel sprouts before it is fully passed the teeth. Flavor and enjoyment would easily triple with a little slash of coke and a whole lot of cola."

1.0,An insult to Canadian whiskies.
3.0,"Black Velvet has a gold appearance, with loose alcohol legs. Aroma is of some sourdough bagel, musty cornbread, and charred oak. Taste is of charred oak, with wood emphasized over char, corn distillate filler, and a touch of nectar. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and Black Velvet has a medium to slow finish. RJT"

1.0,"Color: The color is a light corn yellow, and this Canadian whisky has thin little legs that leave droplets on my glencairn glass.

Nose: The nose has a pretty simple bouquet of corn, caramel, and pancake syrup mixed with honey. Pretty sweet smelling to say the least. 

Taste: The palate I am needing to work for in order to find anything worthy of mention. Honey sweetness maybe with a touch of cinnamon. 

Finish: The finish is minimal to nonexistent except the fleeting sensation of Splenda sweetener leaving you with only a tingling mouthfeel. (Though as you wait and the mouthfeel goes away, an almost charcoal / bitter aftertaste appears at the back of your throat.) 

Opinion: I learned that this brand is the second largest seller of Canadian whisky behind Crown Royal herself so I felt I should give it a try. I'm glad I did, but let's just say I'm glad I only invested in a 50ml sized bottle. It's not terrible, but it's not great. I'm willing to give the Black Velvet Reserve a try, the older brother of this dram, but this one didn't impress me. Sorry Black Velvet. Sláinte!"

1.5,"And now for something completely different, a cheap Canadian whiskey.
There's a little sweet corn and vanilla on the nose, ethanol and  vanilla on the palate, the finish is short, it starts sweet and ends with a hint of bitter tar.
A 50ml sample is sufficient. No need to taste ever again."
2.5,It’s cheap whisky
3.0,"Nose: Classic characteristics of Canadian Whisky with notes of malt, vanilla and apple. Milk chocolate, toffee and hints of maple appear with a touch of nuttiness, macadamias.

Palate: immediate taste of butterscotch and malt. Chocolate follows through with lighter notes of apple and vanilla. Very simple in character, but enjoyable nonetheless.

Finish: Short finish with influence of oakand green apples ending with a touch of vanilla."

1.5,"An unexpected, but not unpleasant, tartness on the nose. Flat taste of the usual baking spices with a wooden undertone. Quick oily linger. Adding ice helps to bring out some sweetness. Fine whiskey for mixing, but not my go to for sipping."
1.75,"It's been at least 12 years since I last had this - and then it was mixed with coca cola.  I've probably sipped on this bottle once, but I don't recall.  The bottle in question was gifted by a family member, is full to the neck but has been opened and has been in my posession for at least 5 years.  That said...

Black Velvet is a Canadian whisky.  In fact, its the number 2 selling Canadian whisky after Crown Royal.  Its owned by Heaven Hill and produced in the Black Velvet Distillery in Lethbridge, Alberta.

Tasted neat in a glencairn.  I let the drink rest for about 5 minutes before evaluating.  The pour is a brassy, light color.  Not much viscosity to the swirl.  The nose has immediate notes of grain alcohol, and something a bit sweeter with fruity notes.  Overall the nose is indistinct and thin.

On the pallete the thin nature continues. The whiskey is a bit watery, with no appreciable finish.  It's not satisfying at all.  There's a little drop of sweet, a bit of alcohol and then a flash of white pepper.  Finally, there's a bit of a bitter aftertaste.

I have no idea what I'll do with the rest of this bottle. This isn't something I'll drink neat again, it's definitely a non-descript mixer. Smooth?  Sure, because there's nothing going on.  Sweet?  Maybe a little.  Interesting?  God no.  

(review update: after further consideration I realized I'd never drink this and won't serve it to friends, so down the drain it went)

My scale is 1 to 5, with 2.5 being the peak of the bell curve. Most competent whiskies will end up between 2 and 3.  For me, this one doesn't make the cut.  I'm quite sure there are worse whiskies out there, and I hope I none of them end up in my cabinet. 

Hard pass."
3.0,"For the price... a bargain... as a mixer.  At one time, this was a heavily advertised top shelf Canadian.  If you buy Black Velvet... get the toasted caramel version. Well worth he extra buck.
Too many better choices... but for a really inexpensive whisky..."
