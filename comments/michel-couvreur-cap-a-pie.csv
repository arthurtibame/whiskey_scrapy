4.5,"If you’re reading this, you’re probably not fact-checking the distillery and chances are you’re not an expert at this. Maybe you like the bottle, or you got it as a gift. In any case, here’s what you need to know: This is a rare kind of blend. These bottles are not always available, which makes them unique to get. 

Tasting notes: this is a very smooth whiskey. It has a clear ‘buttery’ foretaste and a long lingering palate. It’s definitely not sweet, floral, or fruity. This whistle carries nice salty undertones. Pairs well with (good) olives. A great bottle honestly. If you find it on the shelves, buy it. It’s well worth the money."
