2.0,"Smells good... slight honey, vanilla, some herbs, and a strong minty note. Sweet on the palate, the minty note carries over. Slight bitterness lingers. This is light, except for the herbal minty note. 7/21/18"
4.0,"Easy drinker. Not too much spice. Nothing extraordinary, but a good solid whiskey. Got to meet and have my bottle signed by Stephen Beam, so that have influenced."

3.0,It’s okay. Not a very full flavor. Hits the back of the tongue. The sherry stands out

3.25,"Fruity, spicy, wood polish, bitter oakiness sasperella. I wouldn't say I've had a great bourbon run recently especially the rye ones to be honest. This screams youth and astringency. Not to much mint which is a plus. Once I work through the remnants of my sample collection I'll be forgoing purchasing any dram without a 4+ rating. To many average ones in the 3.5 - 3.9 range I've wasted my taste buds and liver cells on especially in the newer distillery and rye categories."

3.5,Mild nose. The sherry cask brings sweet figs forward. Slight menthol and oily texture. Lack of spice and heat for a rye. Nice but uninspiring.

4.0,Spicy like a rye should be but not overpowering.  Some very pleasant fruity and sweet notes from the sherry cask finish.

3.75,fruity and a little spicy
3.5,A straight “minor case” rye with the 51% cut off. Pleasantly aromatic and not too sweet given the high corn %.

4.5,"this is very nice. the Sherry levels the playing ground with the heat. Not crazy complex, just a good dram for a day in."
3.5,Spicy but not overwhelming sweet finish. Great place to visit. Stephen Fante is the best tour guide in Kentucky! Steven Beam signed my bottles and was amazing to talk to.

3.75,Neat. Nose is sweet rye. Taste is sweet caramel rye with a sweet rye spice finish. It’s pretty good. Generally don’t care for young rye offering and was given this sample from a friend. It’s pretty good for a younger rye and I would drink again.
