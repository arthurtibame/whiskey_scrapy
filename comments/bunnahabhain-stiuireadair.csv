4.0,Tried this on ‘malt of the month’ deal and really enjoyed it. Little peat for an Islay but a sweetness and full flavour I enjoyed.
3.0,"Sweet, with some cream and nuts. But towards the end you can distinct more and more salt. Need to give it another try. [JG 2018]"
3.75,Nice smoke and peat. Sweet becuase of sherry cask

4.25,"It’s time for another entry from The Unpronounceable Series (That there is trademarked, not to be used without written permission of Ricky Bobby, Inc.), from the fine fellows at Bunnahabhain Distillery:  Stiuireadair (Gaelic for “helmsman”).  This NAS whisky is deep copper with thin legs and watery drops.  It’s bottled at 46.3% ABV.

The nose is nicely sherried with a wonderful bouquet of vine ripened fruits, roasted nuts, caramel and spice cake.  I get a little bit of Dr. Hahn’s Prune Candies, too.  There’s no hint of oak or heat, though.

The palate is also rich and surprisingly deep with sherry notes.  It’s very spicy but not in a hot sense.  It’s really luscious and smooth for being an NAS.  The mouthcoat is light, but hearty- kinda like those really thin pancakes.  There’s a faint salty abrasive aspect that catches you off guard at the tail end, but the official tasting notes talk of a salty characteristic- so it hits the mark.  I just think it’s at a bit of an odd spot.

The sweetness will slingshot you into the finish for the win, with the spiciness providing a lingering warmth.  It finally comes to a close with a hearty, roasted almond flavor.  It’s like a big, hairy, American winning machine- except it’s Scottish.

Overall, it a solid dram.  It’s one of the better unpeated, NAS bottles- in general.  Now for the kicker- it’s only $46!  That’s great VFM, my friends.  It’ll keep you warm on those chilly, Talladega Nights.  Seek this one out and snag an entire bottle- you won’t be disappointed (especially if you’re a Bunna fan).  4.25-4.5 stars.  Cheers, and remember- if you’re not first, you’re last."

3.25,"Nov 2019.
Clear medium gold.
Gentle banana, tropical fruit, pineapple, ripen tangerine, honey, and a little plastic wood and plastic leather in nose.
Medium body with spicy, nuts, honey, wood, old leather and tiny bit of seaweed salty.
Good balance and easy finish.
Classic ex bourbon malt whisky.
Nothing bad but nothing extraordinary either."
4.0,This tastes a little young but it is bright and brilliant! No substitute for the classic 12. But if sea brine and sherry are your thing this will do it for you. The sherry is there but not overpowering!

3.0,"I grabbed a sample of this, sent by @LeeEvolved, for my few days of a business trip in Denver.  This one is from their Tongue Twister Series, purposely designed to make any non-Scot look like a blabbering idiot.  

Overall, a decent dram.  Definitely young, you can feel the raw heat from the onset.  Unpeated, but it has a hefty dose of smoke.  At $45, it’s an affordable decent Islay that won’t break the bank, or your taste buds.  

Thanks for the pour Lee !"
2.5,"The third of five samples from an official Bunnahabhain tasting set is a disappointment. The nose is fine: a sweet, delicate peat. But the palate is thin and dominated by tannins. There’s a brief blast of sweetness, but nothing with any depth or complexity to it. The finish is short and sour. I really enjoyed a peated NAS Bunna I tried previously — Ceobanach — but neither this one nor the Toiteach I sampled earlier in the week are working for me."

3.0,"Salted caramel to start off with.  It has quite a strong sherry note, with some fruit, but most of all it tastes young.  The saltiness stays with you for a while.  I’m a big Bunnahabhain fan, and have liked many of their NAS bottlings, but this is one of the poorer expressions in the range.  It’s still an OK dram, but it’s not one of their best."

1.5,"I’ve yet to find a bunnahabhain I like. There is alcohol on the nose betraying a young spirit although some caramel. 

Palate is spicy, overly so with some caramel. 

Palate is continued spice and wood.

Don’t like it. Sorry"
3.5,"Nose: brine, caramel, slight citrus, pear, floral, cinnamon, sherry, gingerbread 

Palate: caramel, cinnamon, oily mouth feel, persimmon, baking spice, sherry, pear

3.5,Potent. Young. Briny. Coats the mouth. Spicy. Light fruit. Overall I enjoyed the dram but not sure I’d enjoy the bottle.

4.0,This is a whiskey provided through the tasters club.
3.5,"Creamy taste, creamy, dried fruit, with a little burn at end and lasting taste of spice. Very tasty and especially good value for money."
3.0,Something vaguely royal icing-ish on the nose. Salty caramel and young whiskey on the palate. If you took all the good flavors out of Laphroaig this is what you would have left. But whiskey is still whiskey.

3.5,"Bunnahabhain Stiuireadair  is a relatively new release. Nas and 92.6 pf non chill filtered natural color and only $37 for a non peated Islay. Im a lover of the 12 yr so was looking forward to this less expensive offer. Poured neat, nose im getting fresh from the pot hot strained al dente pasta, little bit of white grape, scotch tape, light malt and a pile of leaves and twigs. Palate is soft sherry malt, under ripe fruits and nuttiness with some young wood tones. Mouthfeel is soft and slightly oily. Finish is drying vanilla malt, toothpick and a whisp of smoke. Im digging this stuff. The flavors are somewhat underdeveloped compared to the wonderful 12 yr but somehow this is not a problem for me. It makes it different swapping the dark fruits for a more raw Scottish barley feel. Gives it a purity in some ways. Adding couple drops of water amps the nose and adds some beeswax, makes the mouthfeel flat out creamy and blends palate notes together. This isn't a deep complex malt and wont ring your bell if you are a seasoned vet.......however for the money this is tasty guilt free indulgence. Straight up ide give this a low B but factoring price Im bumping to a mid B rating 85/100...........Bunna and Laddie are superb non peated Islays in pretty much whatever they put out imo"
3.25,Good well rounded slight burn at end.
