The ages of the barrels used vary year on year but apparantly they are between 6 and 12 years old. Maybe knowing a little bit more about this swayed my opinion but i thought it was fantastic , adding a little bit of water as i went allowed me to find the exact sweet spot that i wanted the abv to be for my tastes. Exactly what a cask strength straight rye whiskey should be. A great find."
2.75,"Appearance:  rose and straw like with thin quick legs.

Nose:  Ethanol, dill, and saltwater taffy.  The nose is very faint.

Palate:  There is a medicinal quality to it almost like isopropyl alcohol initially.  This is a young tasting one for sure with a bit of chocolate.  The palate is a bit more rich than the nose but this lacks substance for me.  Needs more time in the barrel for sure.

Finish:  Quick and unfulfilling.  The medicine taste lives on!

Overall-  Not the worst rye I have ever had but far from the best.  It is young and has a distinct rubbing alcohol note that I just can't dismiss.  So many better ones out there for the price.  Old Forester Rye, Wheel Horse and WT101 Rye to name a few in the under 30.00 range that are way better than this one."

3.5,"Seeing this bottle pop up on Distiller reminded that I have been working thru this bottle but had yet to review it! I quite enjoyed last year's release and so when this popped up at my local Costco for under $50 it was an instant buy (SRP is $59.99 for reference). 

So what is this release all about? It's essentially a small batch of MGP sourced rye barrels that are vatted and released at Cask Strength. Thankfully this release doesn't include the chemical additive there other releases currently do (and hence the Straight designation and why I buy it). Is it any good? Let's dive in:

On the palette it's rich and pretty smooth given the proof. Classic MGP notes of candied ginger, clove, pepper, dill and some toffee and slight vanilla to offset the spice. Definitely spicier than last year's release. Give this one some time to oxidize as it definitely improves. For the price paid it's a solid buy. If you don't mind dill and like MGP Rye profile this is a definite buy for you. 

Cheers all!"
3.25,"Nose : some signature dill pickle, grassy notes maybe a hint a oak
Palate: it’s got a good amount of mint to it, tastes fairly young my guess is under 4yrs or right at that if, a little bit of rye spice and that grassy note again. 
The finish is long and minty as well
Overall I’d give this one about a 81 it’s pretty young but well done. 
Sometimes a youthful rye hits the best notes. 
Although for the price point I’d rather have James e pepper rye or the James e pepper cask strength for a fraction of the price."
5.0,Just ...wow! Splash of water opens it us even further. Surprisingly balanced for a Barrel Strength .
