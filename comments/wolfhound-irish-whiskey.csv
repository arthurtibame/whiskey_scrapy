2.0,"It's a nice inexpensive Irish whiskey with the signature smokey peatiness. It is also fairly weak (delicate may be a nicer word). Other whiskies in this price range are probably better for Irish Whiskey enthusiasts, however, if you're trying to introduce Irish Whiskey to someone who's never tried it, the mild flavour, attractive traditionally shaped bottle, fancy gold label with the cute little dog picture, would be a great choice to introduce it!"

3.0,"For a low budget Irish whiskey it isn't bad, it has more character than Paddy's albeit not as soft on the stomach but for a low cost cheap night you can do much worse for much more money."
3.0,Smells and tastes almost exactly like a Nutter Butter cookie. For being so cheap it's good.

1.0,Strong ethanol smell and flavor overpowers all other elements. Repulsive beyond belief. Unable to finish a glass.

2.0,"Meh. Bottle label suggests it's intended for mixing. Unimpressed, but unoffended. Won't try again."

1.25,"Nose: Fruity, citrus mostly. Some caramel. Shortbread biscuits. Ethanol smell is very overpowering. 

Palate: Grassy and grainy. Very plain and not much coming through. Some lemon notes not doing any favors.

Finish: Brief-medium. Alcohol burn on the way down. Sour aftertaste but not a total turnoff.

Overall Thoughts: Definitely glad I only got the $1.99 sample bottle. Very much a budget whiskey and a mixer at best. The packaging would let you believe it’s a gentle giant but I found it a bit too strong. The aroma seems sweet off the bat but once it breathes a bit it just smells of hand sanitizer."
