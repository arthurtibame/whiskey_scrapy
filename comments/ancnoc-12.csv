3.0,"Nose: Best part of An Cnoc 12yo, fresh with floral and citrus notes. Hints of sweet honey nicely on the back.

Taste: Sweet and very subtle. Spicy herbs and hints of chocolate. Hard to notice anything else on the palate.

Finish: Length is good but otherwise a dull finish. Oak with barley with a drying ending.

Balance: Medium bodied and light whisky. For my taste, definitely too flat. Decent single malt."

3.0,Whisky on the Hudson 9/18/2014 :  Light lemon and honey nose and that carries over onto the palate.  Medium light body that finishes oaky with drying tannins. This is a good everyday dram. Not dynamic or flashy.
4.0,"One of the most interesting bottles under $50 I've ever had. It isn't near my favorite flavor profile, but  I find a new note every time I pour a glass. When my 86 (probably 2012) proof bottle goes empty, I'll get this 80 proof to see if it is nearly as interesting."

3.0,"Tried this guy over the weekend as my search for anytime drams that are light on the wallet goes on.

Nose: The usual suspects for a Speyside, Vanilla, Citrus and some kind of cream or frosting.

Taste: This one is strange in that I taste a different note every time, sometimes it's that canned pineapple note everyone talks about, other times it's more lemony/grassy. Oily mouthfeel, creamy.

Finish: Nothing that complex, sweet and refreshing, floral, oaky. Perfect on a muggy NYC summer night.

I don't think this will replace Glenlivet 12 or Glenmorangie 10 as my one bottle a week dram but it is a solid alternative in the price range."

3.0,"On the nose, you may find some vanilla and cream, perhaps even a lemon or two. On the palate, a light lemonade-like sweetness and at times, there is also some acidity or sharpness similar to citrus fruits. Normally not my favorite note, but here it makes the whisky feel very fresh. I can imagine this whisky to be very suitable for warmer weather. Finish is quite lively, perhaps too much for some. You ought to try a sample, see whether you like it, because it has all the qualities of a nice, affordable everyday dram for the right person."

It's just... alright. The nose is herbaceous with the absolute faintest hint of smoke having a threesome with oak. It's all light and lacking in complexity. The palate is more of the same with a touch of salt and caramel, like candy. The finish is fairly medium and pleasurable. Again, it's alright."

There may be something floral there, but it's like faded potpourri, so faint I could be imagining it.  The taste is very buttery, smooth, and has shades of honey or some melon.  The finish is a bit dry, a little gin-like, floral, and tinged with some berries.  It's pleasant but almost too subtle.  I like it but am glad I just bought a sample, if that makes sense."

4.0,"I found a 50ml sample of this 12 year old Highland single malt online and was really excited to give it a spin.  It's medium gold in color and makes some nice, albeit thin legs in the taster.  It's a slightly elevated 86 proof and has an initial nose that fondly reminds me of Macallan.  There's a bit of sweetness, not so much sherry or honey, but fruity with a touch of raisins.  Then there's the young and fresh cut oak.  It's lively on the nose while pushing that sweetness to the back.  It's very enticing.

That first sip is all fresh cut wood.  My first reaction is that this is what Macallan wants from the Fine Oak series, regardless of age & vintage.  I'm not sure if anCnoc is multiple cask aged or not, but if it isn't they damn sure got the best from whatever single casks they used here.  This thing just pops.  I'm so happy with the oak and spice presence that I'm glad there isn't something sneaking in on the back side or the finish to ""ruin"" it.  This thing is so damn vibrant.  

If my palate was fatigued or just dulled at this moment I feel like this single malt would just grab it and shake it to attention.  In fact, I'd love to have a bottle of this to use as a palate cleanser/revitalizer at a full blown tasting just to help keep me focused.

The finish is medium length and a very fitting end to a fine single malt.  Since this was a 50ml I have no idea what an entire bottle runs, but if it's less than any Macallan Fine Oak (and I suspect it is) then it is worth the price of admission.  An excellent pre-dinner aperitif or as a finale to wash away a decadent dessert, you can't go wrong here IMO.  Cheers."

3.0,"Very smooth finish (Scotch Whisky Exp, Aug 2017)"
3.0,"This whisky has a lighter old gold color. The initial hit on the nose is apples, I mean juicy red apples. This quickly dissipates to stewed pears and a hint of cookie dough. If I keep digging I get marzipan, a hint of vanilla in the background, and just smidgen of bay leaf and some oak. Left a bit longer and the bay leaf is coming to the front with some leather. One downside is the longer this whisky interacts with air the less you find on the nose. On the palate there is oak, stewed fruits, a tiny bit of pepper and salt, cardamom and that bay leaf won’t leave. Maybe there’s something wrong with my palate today. The finish is drying, I mean it just sucked out all the moisture from the roof of my mouth. It leaves a lingering stewed pears taste in the mouth, with some leather and that damned bay leaf. Lots of salt and pepper. 
I don’t know how I feel about this whisky. I think it actually dares you to figure it out, throws down the gauntlet “Et uenerunt questum iniurias” (not sure my grammar is correct). Take a break between sips, pears and marzipan wrapped in leather creeps back onto your tongue. Not sure I finished my dram out of pleasure or that I refused to be beaten. I will figure you out AnCnoc 12. IN the end I decide it is an interesting dram, to be drunk slowly on a warm summer evening, which is exactly what I am doing."

Fresh apple, strawberry (first time for everything...), vanilla, and baking spices on the nose; the palate is fresh and clean, but rich, overflowing with apple-cinnamon oatmeal topped with vanilla cream.

4.0,"This is an interesting scotch. Without water, the nose is a bit closed. Fruity, like pears, sweet, spicy, and tobacco. With a drop of water, it opens up, and becomes more intelligible. Tart apples, light smoke, honeysuckle, vanilla, cereal grains, and some savory spices layered on top, like basil or tarragon. The palate is similar, but with dark cocoa, and more barley notes. The nose is better than the palate, for me, but both are excellent."

3.5,"Nose: Sweetly floral, fragrant with an unmistakable aroma of frangipani flowers and honeysuckle (but it's not heavy or cloying at all - just light and fresh). Also oak, lemon peel, mixed spices, brightly aromatic herbs and citrus fruits. An uplifting and delicately bright nose.

Palate: A tropical fruit basket with citrus and pineapple to the fore plus sweet malty, toffee notes. Very nice combination of sweet and cereal flavours.

Finish: Medium/short, but satisfying, with a cereal-oak combination finale.

Overall it's a pleasant, gentle dram - light but not lightweight, with a distinctive floral presentation. It's a great showcase for delicate bourbon cask maturation sweetened with some low-tannin sherry oak. There's nothing here to dislike but it could be considered a little too ""easy"" to be really interesting.

I enjoyed the bottle I had (which I drank last summer and I think it suited the season admirably) but I probably wouldn't bother buying it again. However if you're looking for a gentle, easy-drinking whisky for a hot summer afternoon then you could do far worse, particularly as it is priced very fairly.

3.5,"Distillery names can be a bit confusing: Knockdhu, Knockando - so let's just call this Single Malt anCnoc which is Gaelic for 'black hill'. Fruity acidity, sour berry mash and lemon zest are first to arrive on the nose, but there is a diverse mixture of fresh, floral and malty notes lurking in the back. The taste is spirit-driven, spicy and mildly dry with tropical fruits, heather honey and brown sugar. Just shy of medium length, the finish evolves with a touch of cinnamon, oak and licorice. A good 12-year-old entry-level malt which is flawless, easy-drinking and reliable.

2.75,"This dram needs a good 15 minutes to open up but when it does, it has a really fresh, fragrant nose of green apples and honeysuckle and a tinge of copper. On the palate, more green apples but taking a backseat to raisins, malt and wrapping up with a little cocoa, white pepper and spice. A pleasant, if rather short finish of more of the same, honey, pepper and malt but with an oily quality to it."
3.5,"Oh nice! Sweet but not sickly at all. Honey, cinnamon and a herbaceous edge. Alcohol is there but not hot. Hint of Christmas cake. A touch of smoke, quite gentle. Overall a well priced, entry level taste of speyside (even though it isn't)."
0.75,Bad. Too much butter for my taste.

3.75,"AnCnoc 12 yo is a fun single malt to review because I think it comes off deceptively simplistic. Also, it’s kind of quirky (to me at least): its marketed as a Highland whisky (although you can make a case for them residing within the limits of Speyside); it’s non-sherried (a non-sherried Speyside?!); the distillery has changed their name in an attempt to be less confusing (is it really less confusing now?); and their process uses a mixture of modern and traditional equipment (e.g., new steel & copper mashtun vs wooden worm tubs). It’s also kind of a wonder to me that this relatively small distillery is still around. 

Back to the bottle: sometimes you find the 12 yo as 40%, sometimes 43%. I’m not an expert on the global distribution differences of Knockdhu’s range, but I can say that my bottle for this review is 43% and non-chill filtered. (Distiller’s review lists 40%)

The nose is crisp and fruity: vanilla, peach, biscuits, and honey. There’s also a shifty quality to the aroma: sometimes I get oak like dried leaves, other times it’s more like book pages. Another nice part is the ex-bourbon barrels allow more of the malt character to show through (same for taste). 

On the palate, I get more vanilla, cinnamon, green apple, oak, malt, and some gentle spice and caramel smoke. The first couple times I sat with this whisky, I was pondering how best to describe the sweetness of this dram. I was settling to call it more of an amber honey, but that wasn’t right and then it hit me - raisins seems most apt to me.

It’s medium-bodied treat with a malty core, acidity to balance, and enough complexity to keep me interested. The medium-length finish brings more oak and spice forward, with a nuanced, warming effect. 

At $40, I think anCnoc 12 yo is a solid VFM bottle if you feel like a summertime experiment with a distillery that doesn’t come up as often in conversation. I think the smoke element makes it appropriate for transitioning to autumn too. It’s not something I need to replace as soon as I run out, but at the very least it’s staying on the short list to rotate back in. 

This one’s right on the edge of 3.75+ because of the value factor so I will split the difference with a 3.75 and “very good” recommendation. 

3.75 ~ 86 ~ Very Good"
4.25,Not as much “smoke” as I expected.

3.5,"Nose:
Slight understory scent, with mossy wet wood and some honeycomb.

Taste:
Reassuring dram for a cold winter day.
Honey and vanilla notes, warm leather and cinnamon ending on a light salty note.

Good whisky overall, ticks every box a good Highland malt should."

3.5,"Had a little scotch session at my buddy's, this was one I picked up based on the glowing 98%tile ranking  on Pf66 ( plus it was on sale for $40). Neat, decent legs and coat. Nose is extremely fresh and inviting. No damp/dank notes at all. Lemon buttercream frosting, sweet sliced apple and mild honeysuckle all come through the delicate aroma. When it opens up a solid malt presence arrives. Rich mouthfeel brings dense malt flavor with some honey, peppery spice and fruit. Finish is long malt and cinnamon honey with a touch of spicy smoke and drying wood char. Carries some warming heat with it. This is balanced, crisp and lively; a bit on the dry side but still quite enjoyable. It has a subtle nature but delivers a good maltiness with flavor complexity as well. This one requires time as it may not make a huge first impression. It does come in nicely and you can taste the quality and refinement for sure. I think its a strong non-peated example. 85/100............as I progressed through the bottle this got better and better. The big takeaway for me is just how fresh and lively this smells and tastes"

4.25,"AnCnoc 12 is like The Simpsons. It is an everyday dram with enough going on that it doesn’t get boring. You can watch it again and again and again until you know all the words to Mr. Plow and still research that episode and enjoy it. This AnCnoc is such a nice dram. 
I get cereals, earth, and a whole lotta citrus in the nose. On the palette, there’s a beautiful salinity, then waves of waxy citrus, then a little bit of a menthol or liquorice lift at the end. The finish is medium-long with the black liquorice dominating the beginning then fading to a chewy tobacco. Beautiful dram. Unbeatable value. I highly recommend it. 90/100

Edit - I was debating whether to replace this bottle with another AnCnoc 12 or to have another go with OP 12; a bottle that I had thoroughly enjoyed the last time I had it. I eventually went with the OP. I chose wrong. AnCnoc 12 > OP 12"

4.75,"This is sublime. There is subtle interplay of sweet malt, citrus, pear and apple. The smoke is so subtle many would not catch it--at least it is hard for me. There is some peppery spice on the back of the palate---but this decreases as the dram is exposed to the air. The finish is medium and is both tart and sweet fruit (apple?) with the faintest touch of smoke in the background. Very Nice!!!"

4.25,Fruity. Ancnoc 12 is always nice
4.0,"On the nose there is a sweetness and a lot of citrus. Vanilla and sugared cereals.
Taste: dried plums, caramel, citrus and liquorice.
Finish: medium long with caramel and tobacco.

For the price (27 euro/bottle) this is an amazing whisky that is incredibly hard to beat."
2.5,"More floral than vanilla on the nose at the beginning, but you do get a hint of American wood already in the background.
Once you take a dip sweet vanilla quickly disappeared and comes some dried fruit, I was expecting some raisin but I cannot find it. And yet again it was quickly over shadow by spicy and almost but not quite burn wood taste which lingers to the end.
Definitely not a boring whisky but it won't be my everyday as I personally don't like way too much bitterness of that wood. I don't mind the dry tea on the finish but not that bitterness."

3.5,"Round 2:

Fresh, lemony - almost like lemon pine sol. Little bit of damp maltiness below the surface. Sharp leather note, green apple, cut grass. Lemon zest or orange zest. Slightly solvent, but quickly gives way to riper apple. Maybe a bit of fennel at the back, too! A little savory wood not on the tail end of the nose. 

Light, malty and grainy on the first sip. Becomes a prickly raw honey note through the mid palate. Some of the citrus is still there, and it feels fresh. Some white pepper, maybe a tiny bit of licorice too. Malt comes and goes, as does clove. Starts to taste like Carr’s crackers after a while. 

Finish isn’t too long, has some of that rock candy barley sugar to it and some juicy apple thing going on too. Piney throughout, as well, with a bit of the aniseed happening toward the end.

This one has gotten better and better as the bottle’s been open longer, bumping the score up."
3.75,Great
3.75,"The nose is first apple skins, with a fruit-like tartness. Some sulphuric vegetals: cabbage and broccoli. The tartness is immediately apparently here. Hints of vanilla and sugary caramel.

The taste is sherried oak, with a second wave or more apples skins, with a spicy rind. There is a collection of tree fruits: apple, pear, with a real tannic tartness/bitterness combo.

The finish is metallic and charcoal. The tartness is still there but shares the stage. Some salt at the tail end. Not exactly in my wheelhouse, but I'm digging it just fine."
3.25,"This tastes like the Juicy Fruit chewing gum sold here in the States, Canada, and the UK.  Sometimes, I get a hint of apple.  Other times, I taste smoke at the finish.  As a single malt, it's pleasant but a bit more intense than blended scotches and even other single malt 12s, like Glenfiddich, Glenlivet, Glenmorangie, et al.

3.75,"The nose is caressed by delicate and floral aromas, accompanied by marzipan, honey and lemon zest. Very fresh and harmonious, rather simple but pleasant.
The palate reflects what is found on the nose, with ripe peach, honey, lemon, nutmeg and a pinch of salt. Smudge-free, flicker-free, fresh and compact.
The finish is not very long, fruity and very salty.
Finding oneself to drink spirits produced by excellence, sometimes you forget what are called ""daily drams"": uncomplicated but well structured, solid whiskys that do not offer totalizing experiences but are simply ""pleasant"".
However, an economic alternative to a lot of rubbish that can be found on the shelves of many bars."
