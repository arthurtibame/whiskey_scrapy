3.5,"Whilst in SoCal and after sampling the Whiskey's I had bought it was time to finally mine the parents bar! It's a treasure trove for old dusties! Everything from 60's and 70s Old Grand Dad and Weller to various Malts. Last go round I sampled an early 90s Blue Label. This time I found this one and it was quite hard to get info on it. From my step dad's recollection this one was an early 70s bottling (from the info I did find this was bottled in the 70s and 80s). It's age stated at 12 yrs old and is a blend of malt and grain Highland Whiskey's. The main component is Glen Scotia Single Malt. It's says it's aged in oak from tasting it I can safely say the vast majority of it is aged in ex-bourbon barrels. So how does this old dusty taste? Let's see:
On the palette what is most striking is just how darn viscous it is. It's even thicker than olive oil. This at 43.3% abv is very impressive. My guess is a good portion of this blend is much older than 12 yrs old. The taste profile is classic Highland scotch. Lots of orchard fruits (spiced apples and melons), honey, graham crackers. Mid palette and finish add a good dose of oak and barrel spices with a  wisp of Campfire smoke and brine. 
It actually really reminded me of the Oban 14 with less smoke but way more amplified and rich. 
All on all it's a pretty simple but highly enjoyable blend. This was not an expensive purchase at the time but really shows the difference in cask quality over the years. The barrel influence cannot be understated. 
Cheers all!"
