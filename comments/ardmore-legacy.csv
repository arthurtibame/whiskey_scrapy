3.0,Fairly classic Highland notes greet the nose honey floral with a hint a peat hiding in the background. The taste has a subtle honey sweetness with a big dry and subtle peat finish. A unique dram with peat from the Highlands a must try for any Scotch fan.

3.0,"I would find this whisky hard to beat based on price and flavour. A delicate but rich smoky aroma gives a sense of warmth and comfort reminds me of the warm finish of a coal fire.

The taste is complex with the right mix of sweetness, toffee, honey and fruit along with the beautiful smoke running underneath.

The finish is long and warm without any uncomfortable burn, very easy to drink."

4.0,First tried with Matt Palmer on Sunday 17th January 2016. First night of refreshers. All four of us were out. Class night! So good! Quite peaty but not overpowering. Very decent.

3.0,"Earthy and smoky nose with a little honey. A quick, slick honey on the palate which gets swept away by an oily peat. A little grassy as well, very pleasant and easy to drink. Just the slightest hint of spice appears as you hold the whisky in your mouth and let it roll around. Mild sweet finish. 7/10, worth the price if you can get it under $30."

2.0,"Initially an aroma of lemon wedges covered in soot. There's also some lovely honeydew and sage. Tart and acidic palate up front. There's more citrus on the palate but I'm wanting cream to go along with it like in Glen Grant. The finish is herbaceous, dusted with soot, but short lived."

3.0,"I got this in the mail yesterday as part of the Flaviar sample.  (been as subpar experience so far with them...but, that's for another time).  This one really lacked a personality.  On paper it had the right things going for it, but just didn't deliver.  Sort of like that kid with the great SAT scores who got into a really good school, but then flunked out his first year.   The nose was a bit like burnt grass or hay, mixed with some sort of floral.  Palette was a bit weak...oak was the forefront and you can tell it's young and not quite ready.   Finish is short and sharp.  I'd definitely not buy a full bottle."

2.0,Light and easy to drink but there is better for the price ($70 aud). The alcohol on the nose is a bit harsh like a blended whisky. The palet is floral with a bit of smoke and some suttle sweet notes of vanilla but overall is fairly bland. Well made but a bit boring in my opinion

2.0,"While I enjoyed the Ardmore Port Finish, I found the Ardmore Legacy to be a bit boring. While the finish is pleasantly warm (without burn), the nose and palate are a bit flat - nothing exciting. There's some smoke, but not too much, and definately some honey and oak. It's ok for it's price, I guess..."

Nose: Sea water, seaweed, honey, campfire

Taste: campfire wood, ocean water, honey, pear, more of the ashy wood, and sweetness, as well as some rye spice.

Finish: Quite calm, with little heat, plenty of the smoke qualities popping in flavor and lasting some time. 

Overall: a nice peated whiskey, Ardmore is much more sanded around the edges than the Laphroaigs of the world. Pretty good, worth a shot."

The pallete: very light, earthy, hay, the palate tastes like a hay barn smells

The finish: light, short, and iodine. Not like Islay iodine, very faint.

Overall, this is the friendliest easy to drink scotch on my bar. I didn't have high hopes going into this tasting but it far surpasses some of my other easy drinkers. This one is going to stick around for awhile."
3.75,Lightly peated but also fruity like a highland throughout the nose and palate. My only objection is it would be better as a cask strength.

3.0,"Budget single malt under $30 and peated too, sign me up. Poured neat, light color in glass. Nose has peat but its more of the medicinal bandaid variety. Some smoke too and olive brine. Dig deep and youll get malt, dusty cardboard and just a hint of orchard. Kinda mild but ok. Palate is malt with some smoke and char. Its a bit diluted at 80pf but what you get is decent flavor. Does make for an easy drinker. Finish is smoky with charred meat, some wood notes and far away malt. Islay lovers and hardcore peatheads can probably pass, this is more suited for a beginner. Lets be real though its still scotch with peat so its not bad in my book. Plus this is the malt that gives Teachers its smoke. Call it introductory peaty scotch that's good value for the $$...........81/100.......not a repurchase but if you've never had peat this is low cost option to get your feet wet. Still better than most blends"

Bottled at 40%abv, with a pale staw color.

On the nose, some peat, pepper, dates, blackberry marmalade, vanilla, honey, freshly cut apples, and chocolate powder. Amazing.

On the palate is also a masterpiece: the word here is BALANCE. Ginger, wood in an elegant way, a little hot, a little spicy, a little ashy, some saltyness and a medium spicy aftertaste all wrapped up in a beatiful way.

Overall this is a 95 over 100, another of my top whiskies. If you are looking something to buy, buy Ardmore."
