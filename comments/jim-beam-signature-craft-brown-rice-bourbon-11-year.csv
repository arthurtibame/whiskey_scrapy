4.0,"I am really enjoying this, especially at $13 for a 375ml.

Complex and subtle, with a softness that I suspect is due to the use of rice. Lots of southern sweet tea notes with hints of marshmallow, tannin, woodsy spice, and burnt orange peel.  The nose is so unexpectedly soft, but the finish is medium-long and pleasant."
3.75,"The nose is a great mix of brown sugar, toasted marshmallows, honey and hints of vanilla and dried fruits. The brown sugar caries over nicely across the palate which is rich, with a balanced mix of oak, as vanilla and black pepper round it out as peanut butter and molasses make an appearance at the end. The finish is surprisingly long, as the spiciness fades to reveal a lingering caramel."

5.0,"Gets a perfect rating due to its unique smell and taste. On the nose it has a pleasant earthy tone. Sweet, nutty, and oily going down. A tad overpriced for the size of the bottle, but if you're looking for something different to try this is highly recommended."

4.0,"Soft nose, strong caramel. Rush of flavor on the palate. Sweet and spicy, with chocolate covered pecans. This might be the best of the Signature Craft series. 10/28/18"
