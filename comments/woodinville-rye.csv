null,Just visited the distillery and had to buy a bottle while I was there. Such a nice round tone with a bit of spice.

4.0,"A very nice spicy rye. I am more of a single malt person, but I love this rye in cocktails, it has the ability to stand up to and stand out in a well mixed drink"

4.0,Great smoky Rye with great mouthfeel. It will work well in a cocktail or on its own. Small batch in charred new American Oak barrels.

3.0,"Good amount of rye spice and some nice barrel oak. Makes a decent Manhattan. At $50, there are better choices at half the price (i.e. Rittenhouse). I don't regret trying and will enjoy the rest of the bottle, but will not buy again. Maybe this will improve over time."

3.0,Maybe a 3.5. Needs more age. Good to mix.

5.0,Nice smooth when had neat with a cube of ice
4.0,"There's a lot of vanilla on the nose, and tangy, spicy/sweet oakiness.  On the palate, more vanilla and an almost cola-like character.  The finish is a bit short, but does leave the vanilla behind for a while.  Overall, very enjoyable."

5.0,This is the one that converted me from bourbon to rye. Spicy with a bit of smoke and a hint of vanilla. Wonderfully smooth. Equally good in a cocktail or straight.

5.0,"Nose - Dark chocolaty sweet rye bread, dark vanilla caramel, oaky vanilla, light yeasty aroma like unbaked chocolate cinnamon rolls.
  Taste - Bit thin, toasted cereal, lightly bitter chocolate nibs, pleasant rye spice bite throughout, dark, almost burnt creme brulee top, nutty sweet like caramelized pecans.
  Finish - Lingering chocolaty toasted cereal grain notes, like a dark caramel glazed puffed oat/wheat cereal, lightly bitter burnt vanilla caramel/toffee.
  Score - 90/100"

3.75,Vanilla and spice on the nose. Palate is medium with heavy vanilla and moderate spice. Medium finish. Tastes a bit young and thin but was fun to try!
