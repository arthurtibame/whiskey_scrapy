4.5,"What a unique Canadian expression. There are some dark fruits and honey sweetness, but an almost crazy amount of malt or cereal sugar here. Honestly, it tastes as a grain bin smells. I am taken out to the farm immediately here, and in a way, no other whisky has ever done. I would buy this just for that. So many bottles are just the same or show only a slight variation. This is a love it or hate it bottle. I am on the love side. So cool!"
