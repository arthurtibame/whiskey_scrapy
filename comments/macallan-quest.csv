3.0,"Terrible. 

This is one of Macallan's newest expressions, the ones that replaced the 1824 series. I have had the ""terra"" before and that was a standard Macallan, with an 8 out of 10 score. This one.... well... don't buy it.

The bottle is quite beautiful and intimidating, when you open this big monster bottle you find yourself with a very small rare cork. Well, that feels weird but nothing to bother the whisky.

Bottled at 40%abv, burnished gold color. 

As soon as you nose it, you get that ""dulce de leche - milky way chocolate"" aroma, typical from Macallan. You try to find something else, maybe prunes or hot coffee notes are there. Not much else happening. 

On the palate is absolutely dissapointing. Nutty, almonds, oak, in an unbalanced, unpleasant and boring way. As you know, nutty flavors can come from a heavy, rapid distillation and a short fermentation. Seems to me that they did not put their best efforts on this one and definitively feels as a cheap whisky, NOT THE FINEST CUT.

Aftertaste is a little oaky and maybe some boring spicyness. I could not believe how bad this was, i was with 4 other people and we all agree it was terrible. 

I had to add water to see if something happened, and guess what, two drops of water turns it into......

WATER. PLAIN WATER.

Overall i give this dram a 60 over 100 and may God have mercy on its soul. 

P.S. piece of advice: after this horrible experience, pour yourself a talisker, you will feel a lot better."

3.0,"Straw color, clear, medium to light viscosity. Nose is delicate, with hints of hay, caramel, raisins, coffee, and honey suckle. Palate is well balanced between sweet and umami, with bitter aftertones. Hints of oak, molasses, barley, and nuts. Aftertaste is short, somewhat bitter and nutty. A few drops of water round the pallet, but don't change the taste. Overall not a bad dram, but not as complex as I wish it was."
3.25,"Too soft a nose, too sweet a palate.  A clear miss for the Macallan family.

Nose: Muted oak, Fig Newton cookies, spearmint
Palate: Powdered sugar, green grapes, ginger"

3.5,"This is Macallan’s travel exclusive brand. Being bottled at 40% ABV with no age statement doesn’t seem like a great deal versus Macallan’s 12 year offerings, but I decided to grab a bottle to try for myself. 

The notes on the box are pretty spot on. In addition to the “soft citrus fruits, apple, lemon, vanilla, and subtle oak” I also pick up aromas of honey, cereal, and reed. 

The palate has apple, ginger, almonds, and dried fruits, along with cinnamon, vanilla, and nutmeg. Finish is long and soft with some fruit and lingering cinnamon. The mouthfeel is lighter than the normal Macallan 12, almost watery, but certainly not unenjoyable. 

This is a nice light scotch with some great flavors. The 1 liter bottle is also a nice feature. If you normally enjoy Macallan, you will appreciate this whisky as a lighter version with a few more fruit flavors."
