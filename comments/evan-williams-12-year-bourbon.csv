4.0,"Many mature bourbons tend to start off sweet then spicy, oaky then fruity....at least that has been my experience anyway.

But not this one. This one leads with cinnamon and baking spices on the nose as well as the tongue, before some brown sugar reminds you that it’s still bourbon, and bourbon is sweet. Finally, at the very end of it’s noticeable 101-proof finish, does it also remind you of its 12 year age statement with a delicious swell of oakiness that waves a long goodbye to your tastebuds."

4.0,"This is a really great, bold whiskey - I feel like in  phases it hit almost every flavor profile in turn - from spicy to grainy to woody. A great drink, I went with the 23 at the distillery but probably should have grabbed both."

4.0,"[11.15.15] I had this today with Sis as we checked off or second stop on the KY bourbon trail for this year's NAILE. Good experience at the Evan Williams Experience and so glad we finally made it in. I have a picture with our 4-month-old on cask 469 and will be buying a bottle or few when it is released to our tour group in 2023. 

This bourbon lives up to its billing. High rye influence with extensive time in the oak yields mellowed vanilla with strong maple, walnut and brown sugar flavor. This has a bold and dry finish that isn't probably as spicy as Distiller characterizes it. But surely some heat and black pepper notes. Even a drop or two of water will really open up the flavor but when it does, I'm not sure I like it better. 

Solid whiskey, but for $130 in store I had to walk away from it. OYOs Oloroso even sounds more reasonably priced."
4.0,"While a decent enough bourbon, I truly do not believe it warrants its $129.99 price tag, especially when it is available in Japan for the exchange-rate equivalent of about $26. It's good, but the price gouging and availability is a marketing scam."

3.0,"For the cost +$100, it's not great. I really thought it would be better than the Single Barrel ""Vintage"" but it's not. 
  
  Nose: Tons of caramel with a little vanilla and oak. 
  Taste: Sweet and spicy heat. Full bodied. 
  
  I really enjoyed the Single Barrel more."

3.0,"Interesting, kind of smells like a wheater. Some faint citrus and floral notes, and lots of oak and vanilla. On the tongue, a burst of flavor, sweet cinnamon, like Big Red chewing gum. Sharp wood and leather notes as well, then a short to medium finish, except for some spice and bitterness which remain. 4/20/17"

5.0,"Evan Williams 12 is my regular go-to when I'm in a bourbon mood. I love its smooth, rich complexity, especially if you take your time and warm the glass properly. Oddly, it's readily available here in Japan, and until a couple of years ago for about $20. It now sells for around $30, but that's still outstanding value for one of the best and most consistent drams around."
5.0,"Mannnn this is a solid juice!!!! 
Nose:oak is apparent from the get go,I get almost like this coconut macaroon vibe but with a sour smell at the end...... it’s very reminiscent of the old Ezra 7yr 101 smell but with more of an oak sour hint to it
Taste: the body is the perfect combination of smooth and thick but not too thick to where you feel like chewing in wood (example parker’s heritage 23yr) , this has a nice tongue feel a gentle spice for the proof .,the oak is there reminds me some of EC 12small batch oak but a hint higher proof the tingle of the tongue is gentle and inviting.
The finish is sweet spicy hints of vanilla and gentle oak not overly tannic.
Honestly if price wasn’t involved this would be a daily for me !!!!!!! 
I paid 50 from a friend that went to Japan and for that price I’m more than happy ! If it was readily available for that price idk if it’d be an everyday but I’d definetly have one on deck at all time !

Overall rating regardless of price 89
Pours I like more that are In The similar profile and  proof range ..... rowans creek, and Noah’s mill
Pours I like a little bit less but similar in profile and proof Old Ezra 7yr 101(they’re very similar just add 5years in to the same mash bill and wallahhhh it’s EW12yr) WT101, fighting cock"

3.5,"The flavor notes on this one are pretty simple because it is a classic exemplar of the sweet side of the bourbon spectrum: vanilla, Hershey's chocolate sauce, spice, and cherry cola.  It's pleasurable, if not overly complex.  Its profile feels younger than expected, with relatively little oak.  But, holy crap, they sell this bourbon for $125 (or was it $129?).  That is a lot of money for a bourbon that isn't a limited annual release or special edition.  Actually, that's a lot of money for any bourbon.  Spoiler: I don't think it's worth it.  It's a very solid bourbon, but the price just blows my mind.  This same distillery, Heaven Hill, releases its powerhouse Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, also with a 12-year age statement, for about $70 to $80.  It's stellar.  Until a few months ago, its 10-year Henry McKenna Single Barrel was widely available for $40 (then it won Whiskey of the Year and became impossible to find).  McKenna's not quite in my wheelhouse, but it's an impressive and award-winning bottle.  What makes this one worth the premium, aside from the artificial scarcity produced by selling it only at the Evan Williams Experience?  To add some bizarre insult to injury, Heaven Hill apparently exports this to Japan and sells it for $30 over there.  Go figure.  Try it at the Evan Williams Speakeasy Tour, where $20 gets you a taste of this, Evan Williams BIB, Pikesville Rye, and Elijah Craig Barrel Proof."
3.25,"I am a big EW fan, so I wanted to like this more, but the fact is that it isn’t much of an improvement over the EWSB, which goes for about $30 where I live. This is a good bourbon, but not worth $130."
4.25,"Rich and strong, with sweet and oak first, cinnamon spice underneath. Reminds me of 101 or Weller 107. Very nice."
3.5,"very good, but not worthy of the $130 price tag"

4.0,"So I payed $150 for two bottles of this when a friend got back from japan which is considerably below the gift shop price of around $125 each. 
That being said I don’t judge taste by price so let’s get into it shall we.
Nose: lots of oak like tons, cherry cola(I’ve noticed in older heaven hill products ), slight peanuts and strangely I got some apples.
Taste: oak and oak again! Kind of reminds me of some of the older age stated Elijah Craig 12year stuff . But with a hint more proof.
Finish is long and slow with that oakey profile again. 
Overall I’d say nothing incredibly stands out but I’d put it above most of the stuff out. If given the chance while at duty free pick it up. However at the gift shop prices pass on it.
