1.25,Sweet version of Firewater. Someone else said it and it's true.
3.5,Sweet and smooth but not much of a kick or really any Bourbon characteristics. A sweet version of fireball

1.25,"-It’s ok, smooth but tastes like fireball"
4.25,Definitely a party favor. But.....VERY tasty. Best enjoyed cold.
1.0,"People who throw the term ""pancake syrup"" around to describe whiskey need to try this first.  Hard to have even .5 oz straight.

This literally smells, tastes and drinks like thin syrup.  It really reminds me of bourbon-barrel-aged maple syrup I buy sometimes and is just as sweet.  This might actually be a more cost-effective product to pour on my pancakes... but I think i'm better off just adding a little OGD114 to my maple syrup bottle and calling it a day."
2.0,Tastes exactly what you think it would. Dessert in a glass. Not a daily sipper maybe more of a mixer
2.0,"Nose:  Brown sugar.  Duh.  Smells just like a bag of brown sugar freshly opened. 

Palate: Sweet.   Very sweet.  As name suggests, it tastes like brown sugar.  Mouthfeel is very thin.  

Finish: small burn.  Overly sweet.  

Not my thing.  Would be great in a maple bourbon type cocktail, but not a fan as a stand-alone."
4.25,The brown sugar flavor is full and phenomenal but it’s almost too sweet to sip on its own. Overall it was very good.
