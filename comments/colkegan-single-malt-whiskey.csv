5.0,Mine is a single barrel version. Jubilation barrel #25.
5.0,"On the nose; mesquite, sweet, vanilla, campfire. Palate; really good, slightly meaty from the smoke, pairs well with a medium bleu cheese, slightly salty, very sippable. With water; opens it up, a little more caramely, on the nose it is bbq and less campfire, kc bbq. Endlessly sippable."
4.0,"Very interesting, I saw some articles about it and recently found it at my local liquor store for $46.00 (I am in Colorado) and decided to try it. It has definitely the characteristic of a single malt scotch, not an American Whiskey (Stranahan's which is a single malt still reminders me of a Bourbon more than a Scotch). It is surprisingly balanced, it's young age shows a little on the nose but becomes much more interesting as it sits for a few minutes in the glass, the palate is surprisingly balances, a touch of mesquite smoke but nicely restrained, not overpowering the sweet vanilla flavors. I was concerned that it only matured for 2 years but they managed to have it very balanced and restrained for such a young age, definitely a good whiskey, even compared to some quality scotch Whiskies that I usually enjoy (Balvenie, Laphroaig, Ardbeg). I cannot wait to have some of my friends to try it. I look forward to try some older expressions of this well crafted whiskey as the distillery evolves (I think they were only founded in 2010)"

3.0,Subdued smoke and a nice round maltyness on the nose and a bit of brine. Pretty mellow on the palate but not boring. The finish is long and really spicy. Like the burn from a habanero salsa.
null,"The noise reminds me of an Islay scotch. Very pleasant mouth feel, silky smooth. The finish lingers looking at the back of my tongue. A great addition to my whisky collection."

1.0,"Highly disappointing. On first taste it seems like something interesting and different, but after a couple more sips it dawned on me that it just tasted like a barbecue grill. I had to force myself to finish the glass, it was simply terrible. I'm really glad the liquor store let me return it because it really isn't worth 50 bucks."

5.0,Last night with a good group of guys  and some great cigars we had this most excellent libation. This whiskey is fun and playful. The mesquite smoke does give it a different dimension while still seeming very traditional in the single malt style. The thing about this whiskey is it's youthful maturity. It's smooth like a good 10 to 12 year whiskey even though only aged 2 years in the Southwest's high deserts. The great mouth feel is oily in texture. The initial nose reminded many of us of pie crust and on the palate there was a vanilla Italian cream soda note that prevaded through the whiskey the entire night. I'd give this a 94 over a 91 but that's because of my own personal tastes. I strongly recommend this to anyone that likes a great single malt with a nice twist.
4.0,"This is a prime example of what I like about the current state of American craft distilling.  It is a decidedly New Mexico take on the single malt.  The mesquite smoke provides a subtle, slightly different flavor profile that catches one a little off guard.  To me it has a good balance and is not too smoky.  I keep thinking a hint of white chocolate mixed in with a touch of smoke on the edges.  It's a young whiskey and there is a small hint of a ""white lightning"" rawness.  One might want to compare with a Balcones Brimstone which smokes with Texas scrub oak, but I think the end result is quite different.  Definitely worth a try if you are up for a curve ball.  The bottle I tried is the barrel strength version which has a stronger flavor on the smoke side and a longer finish.  A single cube really let's it bloom."

4.0,This tasty little gym and gives the boys across the pond a run for their money. It is not a bourbon it is not an American whiskey it is something of its own quasi-scotch American tastiness that delivers on every single spectrum that I love about a true scotch style whiskey. Cheers

4.0,"For those who enjoy a bit of smoky flavor in their whiskey, and feel that the Highland scotches are just too overwhelming, this mesquite smoked whiskey really deserves a taste.  It’s a perfect flavor match for sipping, and even better as an after dinner drink when you’ve had a steak or barbecue."
3.75,Very good if you’re a fan of peat smoke and looking for something slightly milder. As I made my way through the glass I started to notice the spice and mesquite a bit more. I may need to have another glass to pick these up.

3.5,Wow different.  Mesquite sweet wood undertones give this a distinct flavor.  I’d repeat it for sure

2.25,"Many signs pointed to this bottle being a hit: a craft distillery single malt with a smoky scotch lean & quite a few rave reviews. But in hindsight, there were red flags too, mainly the way-too-short aging of 2 years in the barrel.

Upon cracking the bottle, the nose to me was pure acetone. After a week it was vanilla & acetone. At the month mark, the nose revealed butterscotch, vanilla, and...acetone. Better with time but still underwhelming. But it was the palate that really failed. Vanilla bland with some oak and that’s it. I could never really detect the mesquite smoke. A head scratcher.

Rating: The Distiller 91 score is baffling as this just hits mid 70s in my book. Such a letdown that I legitimately wonder if I got a bad bottle/batch. Unfortunately it’s unlikely that I’ll ever acquire another bottle or even opt for a pour at the cocktail lounge to find out.

Bottle No: 96"

3.75,"Quite peaty and smooth, hints of caramel. Good local whisky on par with some scotches I’ve had."
4.25,"Wonderful unique. I loved the distinct mesquite smokiness, paired with the complexity of the single malt. There’s something just so American, Southwest about it, like a cowboy walked into a single malt competition and this was his entry. This is a drink to ponder and appreciate, and I loved the direction it takes."

4.25,"I was in New Mexico recently for a conference and had heard a lot of buzz about this whiskey over the years and decided to pick up a bottle. I'm a sucker for a good story and a unique approach to making a whiskey.

At first pour, the liquid is remarkably amber in the glass given the purported lack of age (2-4 years). I've spent a good deal of time in New Mexico, and Santa Fe in particular, and I know how hot it can get there in the summer and how cold it gets in the winter (somewhat like some of the Canadian whiskies we like so much). The nose is enticing. It's unlike anything else I've ever smelled. I can certainly tell that the mesquite smoke is there, but it's not in your face like the Laphroigs of the world, it's more subtle and integrated throughout the whiskey. When you swirl it around in the glass it has long legs.

The taste starts out strong, with a nip from the 46% ABV, but mellows quickly into more of that mesquite smoke, reminding you of burnt ends from a brisket or the tail end of a good southwest campfire. As you let it sit a little longer you start to get the malted barley notes poking through. Repeated visits bring out more of the malt notes, and a bit of a menthol note towards the end. The finish is gentle and warm, and as I stick my nose back in the glass I get more of that lovely mesquite smoke.

I've always had a soft spot for New Mexico. The food and the scenery are incredible and the people are always super nice. Now I have another great reason to love the state. As far as I know, you can't get this one many places outside NM. When I was living in CO we could get it there, but it's nowhere to be found in TX. If you're in the region, poke around the local liquor stores and pick up a bottle. You'll be glad you did."
4.75,"Barr none the greatest whisky I have ever tasted.

Great maltiness paired with mesquite smoke (1/3 of the barley is smoked). A little orchard citrus at the front before it rounds out widely in the mid and back palate. I would never turn down a chance to drink this gem."
3.5,smokey and peaty

2.5,The mesquite has a cleaner character than peat.
5.0,"The color of this whiskey treasure is liquid gold, and thin semi-viscous legs grace the glass walls after a swirl.

The delectable nose is a balance of fruity & savory and possesses notes of sea salt, mesquite smoke, grilled BBQ, pear and apple, ripe banana, strawberry, and raisins.

The palate is delicious with an almost dusty mouthfeel and notes of smoke and pork burnt ends, licorice candy, watermelon, and ripe cantaloupe.

The finish is long, fresh and tangy.

In my humble opinion, this whiskey sets the bar for the American Single Malt. It is so complex yet welcoming, savory yet sweet, and scotch-like, yet proudly American! I am a big fan and will be buying another bottle! I highly recommend! Sláinte!"

Santa Fe Spirits 
Colkegan 
Single Malt Whiskey 

Mashbill:
A combination of 70% malted barley
30% mesquite-smoked malted barley
Aged in used bourbon barrels in a warehouse that experiences tremendous fluctuations in temperature and humidity, accelerating the aging process.

Even though it is from New Mexico you might mistakenly call it a Scotch and for good reason Colkegan comes pretty darn close. Santa Fe Spirits is owned by an Englishman, and everything about the packaging and brand design evokes it. Even the name derived from the owner’s, Colin Kegan calls up misty moors and seaweed-clogged fishing harbors, not the spare high desert of the American Southwest.

Nose:
It reminds me being in a brewery and smelling a pale honey beer than macadamia nut brittle, vanilla, South West BBQ  all sets up like your outside next to the ocean and enjoying the a beautiful sunny afternoon.

Front:
Delicate and smooth with a spice of black pepper, clove, vanilla like late spring in the Pacific northern coast of Monterrey Bay, CA shore grass, wet garden, barbecue, and damp surf city road from the ocean spray. 

Finish:
This finish is long, meaty heat that goes down smooth for days. It’s like taking a bite of a sweet perfectly cook Hawaiian BBQ rib. 

In my my book this is a magical American Single Malt that just takes you places and makes you wonder.

“May you week be full of relaxation and shenanigans!” Ballyhoo!"

null,"Tonight we're gonna try something different. In light of standalone tasting notes and a rating, I thought I'd take varying combinations of the bottles in my collection and those of my friends and do an occasional head-to-head series, where I taste and compare two bottles of similar provenance that often get lumped together in the same category (think heavily peated scotches or barrel proof bourbons). Hopefully this helps you, the reader, to decide which bottle is best for you if you are faced with choosing between two equally delicious but different options. Tonight's lineup:

Whiskey Del Bac vs. Colkegan

Category: American Single Malt
Style: Mesquite Smoked Single Malt
Age: 2-3 years old
Price Point: $50-60 USD
Tasting Setting: Neat, Glencairn glass, rested for 5 minutes before nosing, both bottles approximately half full 

Nose: The nose on the Colkegan is subtle, gentle. There's an earthy, grassy quality to it, with just a wisp of smoke, belying what is underneath, and right at the end is a minty/menthol note. The Del Bac by comparison comes bellowing out of the glass with a meaty, briskety aroma leaving nothing to the imagination as to what you're about to experience. To compare it to a peated single malt, the Colkegan is reminiscent of Caol Ila, and the Del Bac is Lagavulin.

Palate: Colkegan arrives gently, with a creamy mouthfeel. There's a lower percentage of smoked malt in this one, and it's aged at a higher altitude than Del Bac (Santa Fe vs. Tucson). The smoke shows up on the mid-palate on the Colkegan, but it doesn't overwhelm the malt, but rather is integrated, again, like Caol Ila. When the Del Bac hits your tongue, you get a big blast of that mesquite smoke. It's like walking into a smoky Texas BBQ pit where they've been smoking meat non-stop since the 19th century. It coats your mouth, and while you can taste the malt in this one too, the smoke is much more prevalent without being drying. 

Finish: The Del Bac lingers on your palate for a while, which is curious since Colkegan has a slightly higher ABV (45% vs. 46% respectfully). The smoke from Del Bac isn't drying, but it has a slightly numbing effect as it sits in your throat, which keeps the smoke on your palate longer. The Colkegan doesn't linger quite as long, and the smoke dissipates before the finish. What you're left with is a lovely, malty aftertaste similar to and Irish single malt or Lowland Scotch.  

Final Thoughts: Two excellent malts! You can't go wrong with either, but it's unwise to think these two are the same, no more than two malts from Islay are. The Del Bac is for those of you who love big, bold, smoky malts like Lagavulin, Ardbeg, or Laphroaig. The Colkegan is more the speed of Caol Ila, Highland Park, or BenRiach, where the smoke is more equally integrated throughout the dram. These two are often held up as the standard bearers of Mesquite Smoked American Single Malt, though there are other up and comers, such as Andalusia Stryker and Ranger Creek Rimfire. In terms of availability, I don't believe either one currently (as of January 2020) has national, much less international distribution. I bought the Colkegan while on a business trip in Albuquerque, and I had my local whisky shop special order the Del Bac for me (which is a luxury I'm afforded by living in whisky-crazy Austin, TX). There's a lot of competition for your whisky dollar, especially from the craft corner, and I feel like a lot of them aren't good VFM. These two are. When the craft distilling bubble inevitably bursts sometime this decade, I see these two surviving. They're among the best of the American Single Malts, and I predict that the southwest will be to American Single Malt one day what Islay and the Islands are to Scotch. Good hunting, and enjoy the journey!"
