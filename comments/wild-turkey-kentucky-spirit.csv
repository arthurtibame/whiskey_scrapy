4.5,Very good. Definitely sweet and oak
3.75,"Neat.  Party Source 10 year store pick.  My last bottle of KS was a bit disappointing.  Delicious but also not twice as good as regular 101 so it just felt like poor value.  Came across this 10 year store pick and couldn’t resist.

Initial impression, I am glad I pulled the trigger.  The age on this is making its presence known.  Dark sweet oak and vanilla extract.  Lots of cinnamon and baking spices.  Beautiful cherry.  Leather.  Butterscotch.  Gorgeous nose.

Average mouth feel.  Super dark on the tongue.  Bitter even like a dark chocolate.  I have never had anything so dark and bitter up front.  The taste matches the nose.  Heavy oak presence, leather, vanilla, butterscotch, cherry.  It comes in nice waves.  Ends with that bitter dark chocolate.

This dark chocolate note is throwing me off.  It’s like Hershey’s Baking Chocolate, even dries the mouth as if you tries to swallow a spoonful of it.

Comparing it to base 101, the extra years have altered this completely.  The two pours rhyme but are also so different.

Conflicted on this one.  It’s delicious but also too bitter.  The bitterness hangs too.  Maybe it will open up but I think this barrel may be overaged.  Strange."

4.0,"Have I mentioned lately that I really like Wild Turkey? The Russell family puts out consistently good juice with a discernible style, and this single barrel offering is no exception. The usual WT qualities are there - lots of rye and spice, a little caramel sweetness (but not overpowering). This particular expression also has a loamy kind of nose - smells like freshly turned, slightly mossy soil in the background. There's a very pleasant touch of earthy must on the palate, plus a distinct black licorice note. The finish isn't super long, but it sticks around a bit. Good stuff in the awkward turkey-shaped bottle."

3.0,"Wild Turkey Kentucky Spirit is a fun dram. It’s far from perfect, but it’s blatant deviation from the bourbon status quo allow the bourbon category a broader reach while staying true to it’s roots.

Speaking of roots, the nose is a wet forest, oak, soaked leaves, earthy tones reflecting dark soil, vanilla, and almond.

This isn’t overtly bold. There’s a mild to light mouth feel, but solid heat and warm amber make one think of sitting by the fireplace wrapped in a toasty blanket.

The finish is pleasantly dry with walnuts and a slight saltines lingering just a second after you’re done.

Definitely worth trying if you have the opportunity, but I’d hesitate going out of you way for it over some of Wild Turkey’s other offerings.

4.0,"In its bottling and labeling, and perhaps in its taste as well, this bourbon feels a little like a time warp from the 1990s.  This bourbon reminds me a lot of Hancock's President's Reserve, as one of these early single barrel products that has been surpassed slightly by more recent releases and yet continues chugging along while providing a nice core flavor profile.  I find Wild Turkey's to lean to the sweet side of the spectrum, and this one would be a cross between caramel  bread pudding and cinnamon french toast.  It's better than Wild Turkey 101, and notably richer, but it's also double or triple the price at most liquor stores."

5.0,"A real exercise in contrasts: the nose is caramel silk, with tiny pop rocks of shoe varnish rye; then it hits the tongue and the back of the throat, and it’s a fireworks display of bright white cinnamon spice, with a blazing hot, mouth-tingling, hourlong finish. Not my favourite Turkey, and likely overpriced, but definitely interesting. 

Also, is it a reach to say that distiller Jimmy Russell’s palate might not be as sensitive, at age 80, as it once was? Because this tastes like it was selected by a man who wants to taste the biggest possible flavours bourbon can offer."

4.0,"On the nose is rich vanilla and oak with a touch of rye.  With time I start picking up some floral, herbal notes with a honeycomb sweetness.  There is also an underlying rich worn leather aroma and a hint of shelled peanuts.
-
To the palate it is surprisingly dry and oak forward.  A rich blend of spices arrive with a viscous honey sweetness, warm leather, roasted almonds and a hint of blackberries.  Very dense and flavour packed.
-
The finish is long, dry and warm with rich oak and leather notes.  There are lingering hints of vanilla, nuts, berries and cinnamon.

With a drop of water I get more floral rye on the nose, more of a caramelized sweetness on the palate and a slightly shorter finish, but more oak.

Not surprising, but I really like this one.  Tasting side-by-side with classic Wild Turkey 101, I find that one is more sweet, while Kentucky Spirit is significantly more dry on the palate with more oak influence overall.

I think I do actually like this more than Wild Turkey 101, but since it’s hard for me to buy, and way overpriced for what it is... I’ve got to give it a slightly lower mark."

If there’s a weak point, it’s the initial entry on the palate, but this doesn’t even matter because it’s explodes on the mid and into the finish."
3.5,"Bottled 2015.  Opened 1-15–2018.
After being open for a year the flavor has taken a sharp decline.  Hot Cinnamon and dill have taken over and the combination is off-putting.  I really enjoyed this last year but Im afraid I’ve let it sit too long.  The spice and ethanol ratio is unbalanced and kind of awful."
4.0,"Kentucky Spirit is essentially a single barrel expression of their fantastic 101 bourbon, although with a bit more age behind it.  Had a quick taste of Kentucky Spirit at the LLS, so without a full dram to critique in a Glencairn this taste will be less detailed than I like.  

Hard to get a nose on this out of a plastic cup but what I could get was traditional Wild Turkey bourbon with extra helping of spice, vanilla caramels, toasted wood back end.  A bit more robust and full than 101.

On the palate I was immediately hit with a nice sweetness and strong cinnamon spice.  I love Wild Turkey products and am used to their signature cinnamon burn, especially in 101 which is a favorite of mine.  The Kentucky Spirit really amps up the cinnamon spice though, almost like a spicy cinnamon candy.  After that initial wave of strong tingly cinnamon spice, you get a bit deeper vanillas, brown sugars, and caramels than you get in 101, although unmistakably Wild Turkey bourbon at its core.  On the back end you retain that nice toasty wood barrel that also makes Turkey bourbon so fine.

KS finishes fairly long and you retain the caramel and toasted brown sugars all mixed with more toasted oak.  Alright by me!

Overall KS is darn tasty Turkey bourbon, but aren't they all!  At around $60 for a bottle I honestly think you can do a bit better with the $45 bottle of Rare Breed at higher proof cask strength.  Or save even more $ and grab the Russell's Reserve 10 year.  It's rich, deep and just as tasty at half the cost of KS, albeit a lower proof and you lose the high cinnamon kick.  I'll probably eventually grab a bottle of KS down the road to really pick apart all the nuances but I think with Rare Breed being cheaper and arguably better, it makes for a hard sell on this one.  I feel like KS should settle in the $40 to $45 range.  Cheers!"

3.5,"50.5% abv (101 proof)

Nose: in a word, excellent. fruity, including red apple and cherry; vanilla: slight cedar; caramel; clove; cinnamon spice.

Taste: full, viscous and decadent! Creamy vanilla; cherry; cola; and oak barrel. Whisp of smoke from the char nicely woven through. 

Finish: short-medium; drying with vanilla and cinnamon sugar dominating; slight heat from chili spice; touch of mint; syrupy sweet cotton candy and sour at the tail end.

Value: $50-$60. A bit pricy. 

Final thoughts: an overall great Single Barrel bourbon that’s near perfect for sipping and is sure to please fans of Wild Turkey. But the finish is a bit lacking. Given the choice I think the higher abv Wild Turkey Rare Breed is superior than this more relaxed and price-comparable counterpart. 

Score: 3.5/5

Recommend trying or buying a bottle at a good price."

3.25,"Taste: Neat 2 oz in glen cairn, and then 2 drops water.  Barrel 1272, Rick 42, 5/23/19 bottling.

Nose (3.25):  Traditional Wild Turkey musty nose.  Barrel spice, oak, raw peanuts, and vanilla.  Got a little honeysuckle in there too.  Nice nose, somewhat floral.

Palate (3.25):  Initially a bit harsh on the ethanol and soapy.  This does dissipate quickly on the rear palate where the peanuts and honey come through.  Lots of spicy, peppery notes here. A bit medicinal. Palate was somewhat of a let down for me.  

Finish (3.5):  Takes a big Kentucky hug.  This is a man's man's bourbon and I appreciate the prickly roughness.  Notes are a bit woody.  Stays on you for a good long time.

Overall: Bought this at the distillery as a pre father's day gift to me.  I had much anticipation as I am a bit of a WT fanboy.  I wasn't wowed, I wasn't bummed. I would buy Rare Breed 5x over as compared to this though.  A little one dimensional, a little rough around the edges.

The nose has vanilla, rye, sour bread dough (not sourdough bread). There’s also some baking spices with brown sugar, dark fruit and a little oak.

The palate has a light oily mouthfeel. I get oak, leather, rye, and a little bit of black pepper.
It starts to dry out the mouth in a chalky way as you move it around. 

The finish is nice, with some burn. It’s on the shorter side of long with lingering oak and rye notes.

I think this one is pretty decent and differs from the other WT offerings at this price. Though if I had the choice, at this price point I would go Rare Breed all the way. And then Russels Single Barrel."

4.0,"Picked by Elixir Spirits “No Dressing Necessary”. Officially reviewed by the ultimate Turkey fan, RareBird101. I think he gave it a 3.75. I’m giving it a 4.0 as I enjoy it quite nicely. Barrel came from Camp Nelson F on the 4th floor. It is truly a mingling of sugarcane sweetness and oak spice with a nice Carmel backdrop. There isn’t a ton of other flavors although I pick up a little sawdust, cinnamon, sweet tobacco and a little pecan pie. The mouthfeel is a little thin but somehow the finish is long and pleasant. It reminds me of a fall day when tobacco barns are burning giving that sweet scent. I normally get more vanilla spice in WT101. This barrel has a little more going on and a much more prevalent and smooth finish. There is pure maple syrup on the finish. The current Rare Breed at 116.8 will score higher from me and it’s much cheaper but when the temp is up in the dog days stretch of August I will reach for this every time!"

I was unimpressed at first, but give it some time to develop a complex bouquet of Dried Spices. Black Pepper, Cardamom, Nutmeg, Cinnamon Stick, and Clove. It's like opening the spice cabinet in your kitchen after a few months and being hit with the scent of nearly all of the spices at one time.
NEAT: Thick, Clingy and Oaky on the palate to start with. Vanilla, Caramel and some of those Dried Spices pick up mid palate. Clove, Cinnamon, and Black Pepper. A drying finish with Oak, Black Pepper, Cinnamon and Orange Peel coating. A nice warming Kentucky Hug on the way down. 
SPLASH: A few drops of water brings the Cinnamon note to the fore on the nose. A Burnt Brown Sugar Sweetness is added to both nose and palate. Clingy Black Licorice on the finish.
VERDICT: I have really struggled with the decision whether to purchase this one or not. It is basically a Single Barrel version of their standard 101. NAS (but my guess, based on the oak influence, is 8-9 years) and a whopping $35 more than the standard 101. With all that working against it, I was surprised by how much I liked it. Is it $35 better? No, but it is a unique take on the WT profile. In fact, this is a store pick for my local ABC and I'm tempted to save up for another bottle from this barrel. On a side note..Whoever decided to change the bottle shape and labeling should be fired IMMEDIATELY! By far the biggest downgrade in packaging I've ever seen."

3.5,This is exactly as good as a regular bottle of 101 so I will deduct points for it costing more than twice as much

Classic vanilla and caramel with a complimentary spice. Medium-long finish. Nice sipping bourbon."
4.0,"The first taste heat, disipates quickly, slightly sweet"
3.75,This was so much better than the last barrel pick I had. Smells like wild turkey. Had a nice smooth and sweet start ending in that wild turkey funk with a moderate finish. Buy this one. All dependent on who picked the barrel.

4.0,"Nose - little ethanoly. Some orange and cherry sweetness. Maybe a little maple or caramel. 
Palate - very nice oak notes. Some initial fruit then leather and oak. Very solid bourbon tastes. Medium spices. 
Finish - very smooth and easy going down. Very nice all over tingle and mouthfeel."

4.75,"Look: Amber in color, Kentucky Spirit doesn’t look much different than most other bourbons. Lacing when moving the spirit around, alcohol legs, etc.

Nose: Cinnamon and sugar are filling my nostrils even before going in for a sniff. Caramel, toasted bread, more cinnamon. Swirling gives more of that caramel smell rather than spice. 

Palate: Oakiness hits first, followed by the cinnamon sugar, and more barrel. Way more wood than I expected, but the sweetness comes back mid palate, followed by a nice mix of spice with the other flavors 

Finish: Cinnamon, clove, slight oak and even less astringency, but it’s there. There’s heat, but not overpowering. 

Overall: I think I paid $50 for this bottle, and it punches at that at least. I love the mix of spice and sweetness, reminding me of my childhood using cinnamon sugar on buttered toast."

3.75,"Picked this up at the recommendation of a local shopkeeper that said it was his go to bourbon. Nose is honey and brown sugar, but also a bit strong on ethanol factor. First sip definitely has a sharp initial bite to it mixed in with some strong corn and honey notes. Burn comes on medium in the finish, but mellows to a delightful caramel sunset. The sharp bite is a bit much for my liking, but the finish definitely brings this around to a decent pour."

3.5,"This is a bit of a conundrum. It has far more flavor than most at this proof. Sometimes a bit more water can coax more flavor from the barrel, but in this case, while smooth with 8-9 years of age, the oak is just far too prominent—and obscures the other notes of tea, nutty and corny sweetness. It’s really hard to recommend this at 3 times the price of WT101 or at 50% more than Rare Breed, which is higher in proof if a bit more one-dimensional. Overall this seems a bit like a money-grab, and I’d recommend you spend your bucks on the aforementioned Turkey products or Russell’s Reserve 10 year old for way less money.  It’s perfectly fine—but not $60 fine."

4.0,"10/5/15 bottling, barrel 616, warehouse T, Rick 1, Liquor Barn Series 4. This is fantastic. Sweet tea, creamy, good finish. Good store pick. 11/5/19"
4.25,"Smooth with warm and rich flavors - oak, leather, caramel. Center of the tongue excitement with long mouth."
3.75,"The nose is gentle, surprising for the proof, and has oak, vanilla, molasses and hints of cherry and leather. The palate doesn’t quite feel like it coats the entire mouth, but immediately brings oak, cinnamon, vanilla, molasses and a bit of cherry and cola to finish it up. The finish is medium with a lingering cinnamon oakiness with soft molasses that fades."
3.75,"Like a smooth WT101. Needs more proof. Not a bad pour but 101 is nearly as good for much less, and Rare Breed is far above."

4.0,"This is another Camp Nelson F pick but this time it’s from the 6th floor. 2019 was a great year for WT with all these Camp Nelson barrels getting picked for Russell’s Reserve SIB and Kentucky Spirit. It’s oakier and spicier than the last Kentucky Spirit I had from the same warehouse but floor 4. The 4th floor appears to be much sweeter. This one is a little older as well at 9 years and 6 months old so the added oak in this one makes sense.

The nose on this is extremely oaky with extreme vanilla and brown sugar. The palate is spicy with cinnamon, barrel char and then transitions to cherry pie. The finish has oak, tobacco, cherry coke and and a really great unique effervescence. It’s palate is not complex but enjoyable. The nose, finish and mouthfeel are worthy of being a legendary or special edition bottle. 

I know most reviews of this usually state that “it’s good but not worth 60 bucks when I can get a 1.75 of WT101 for like 35 bucks”. I disagree with those takes. I will pay for the consistent quality and changes in nuanced flavors depending on the floor and Rickhouse as I have become a fan and started to learn the warehouses a bit. It’s one I will always have around and enjoy not having to pay huge markups and search like crazy for a product that really fits my wheelhouse and comes from a great distillery."
