5.0,Retasted Jul-13:  needs to open up a bit and get some oxidation going..then the elegance does come out
4.0,"I finally opened up my bottle of this that I got over 6 years ago during a business trip to the UK.  It’s really not often that one has the chance to taste something this old.  We treat it with reverence as we should, I guess...considering the rarity.  Back then I paid just under $450.  Seems like a bargain for a single malt from Speyside.  I guess inflation is hyper-drive when it comes to current whiskey prices. Now, I see this more as $1000 easy.  So—I’m going to venture a guess that this is Glenfarclas.  Darker sherried color ( it’s NCF and no-color added ), with taste of berries and dark fruits.  Palette is short of the nose, but the finish is warm and lingering.  Seems light for a 50 yr old...I would never have guessed it’s age...acts younger.   It”s good...it really is...but I guess it falls short of my expectations.  I was expecting more of an austere elegance, but comes across as a silky youngster."
