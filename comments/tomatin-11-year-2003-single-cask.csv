4.0,"I’ve been a big Tomatin fan ever since I tried their 14 year, port finished and French Oak offerings, then the Cu Bocan variations sealed the deal.  These guys make some of the best, reasonably priced single malts on the market.  Ironically, the older bottles I’ve tried didn’t deliver the goods like the younger ones (while also jumping in cost).  My advice:  stick to the 10-14 year olds with various finishing treatments and the Cu Bocan.  I have a bottle of 25 year old, but I’m not exactly excited to open it.

This 11 year old is from a single cask designated to Lukas Wine & Spirits out of Missouri.  I threw this bottle in on a small order of Compass Box whiskies for the measly sum of $34.  It’s obviously cask strength at 56.6% ABV and it continues the good vibes I get from other young, cheap Tomatin.  I’m guessing they sample various casks 4-6 months prior to bottling the core 12 year and offer up some nicer ones for single cask, store pick bottles and market them by vintage year and as 11 year old juice.

This one was ex-bourbon cask aged and is champagne gold in the glass.  Cask strength means little or no legs and only tiny droplets forming around the rim when you spin it.  Nice and oily appearance, too.

The nose is typical Tomatin:  lightly sweet vanilla, oak and pepper spices and a nice little pop from the ABV.  It’ll burn if you inhale too deeply, but it still maintains a sweet vibe if you’re a little more gentle with it.  Extra time doesn’t offer up much change.  The palate is also warm to hot, depending on how you roll it across the tongue.  The oak is the star of the show and I think this one would play very well for bourbon lovers.  It tastes like some better bourbons I’ve had and subsequently had to pay significantly more for (I’m looking at you Woodford and Jefferson’s).  It’s not as sweet as most “wheaters”, but not as corn forward as most bourbons.  It’s in-between.  The finish is short to medium and dry with oak tannins hanging around a bit too long, but somewhat expected.

Overall, I can’t score this like some miracle whisky because there isn’t much complexity, but it delivers a steady, nice punch of flavor and power.  I just checked the Lukas store website and they’ve lowered the price in attempt to move more bottles.  It’s $30 now.  At that price I recommend a buy- hell, buy 2.  That’s a solid deal for an 11 year, cask strength anything!  3.5 stars, bumped to 3.75 due to value for money.  Cheers.



PS- As a whisky advocate I want to take a moment to encourage those of you here in the States to start harassing your congressman/congresswoman to do something about opening up shipping of beer/wine/spirits across all 50 states.  These crazy laws that complicate and limit our buying power need to be eradicated.  The current US President is a bit of a nut, but he does like to support American business and what better way to support them then by allowing people everywhere to get easier access to their product.  Perhaps they’ll listen if we raise our voices a little.

I’ll get off my soapbox now, lol.  Man, I need a drink."
