5.0,Splendid Peaty smell! Light taste with some kick!
3.5,"Pretty young going off the color and nose.
The nose has that new make sour note, maybe a buttered popcorn jelly bean. Of course smoke, but more of an iodine candle by the sea than a campfire or burnt rubber. Some citrus and honey as well.
Taste is a bit like unripe orchard fruit cooked over a campfire. Some bring notes as well. Finish is long and reminds me of a tack shop. Overall, a good value and I look forward to seeing it open up over time."

3.0,"Very strong malt notes and smoke. Thought this would be made of some island distilleries??? Sort of sea watery and salty tastes. Citrus and honeys are the lighter notes. 
Not too oily, not too thin but leaves a good thicker mouthfeel. A bit of leather, and overall earthy ness. Good presentation at 46%."
