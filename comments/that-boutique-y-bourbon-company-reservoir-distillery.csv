4.0,"Have you ever heard the phrase ""every bourbon is whiskey, but not every whiskey is bourbon""??? Well, that doesn't apply here. This ""exception"" for the rule is based that nowadays it is legal to call ""bourbon"" to a distillate that has only matured in an oak cask for only two years. Traditional whisky, (and irish whiskies) are legally required to have at least 3yo of maturation, that is why That Boutique-Y Whisky company has decide to even rebrand the company's name for this one and called it ""That Boutique-Y BOURBON Company"".

Actually this baby comes from a distillery called ""Reservoir"" in Richmond, Usa. 

Bottled at 46.6%abv.

On the nose, some weird notes for a bourbon appear: raw rice, fresh fields, soap and caramel. It's kind of odd. 

On the palate, it is very light. With a clear honey note; hay, and some headache pill notes, like those white ones that as soon as you put one in your mouth it starts becoming like dusty when it melts. 

Aftertaste gets a little grainy note; more of this headache pills note and very grassy. 

Overall this is something very interesting and different. Personally i would not drink more than one glass from this, but it is not bad and surely is a nice experience. 80/100."
