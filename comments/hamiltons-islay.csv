3.0,Budget Islay. There are better ones out there.
1.5,Tastes of peat and nothing else. It might be useful to add to other spirits if you want to imbue them with some peat smoke. Not for drinking on its own.

3.0,Smoky and quite simple dram Nice for cocktails
3.5,"Heavy peat smoke with brine and caramel on the nose, the smokey peat and sweet caramel on the palate don’t really mesh, smokey, spicy medium finish. A splash of water mutes the smoke on the nose and helps blend and smooth out the palate, it also tames the finish a little."
