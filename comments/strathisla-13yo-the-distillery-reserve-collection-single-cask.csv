5.0,"Another expression from this beautiful ""The Distillery Reserve Collection"", this time the heart and soul in every Chivas Regal, the Strathisla Single Malt. A 13yo whisky, cask strenght, single cask, a real rarity and a nice treat. 

Bottle 58.3%abv very Reddish color. 

On the nose: Pedro Ximenez sherry. I Don't if any PX was used but it definitively has its aroma. Berries. Marmalade. Sherriness. 

On the palate it is SUPER SMOOTH. A real Sherry bomb. Chocolate. Figs. Marmalade and Dark chocolate. Incredible.

Aftertaste is perfect. A raisin, plum, blackberry jam madness.

Overall this is such an amazing dram. 5 stars without a doubt. Very enjoyable, no alcohol at all at this high strength, my score is 97 over 100."
