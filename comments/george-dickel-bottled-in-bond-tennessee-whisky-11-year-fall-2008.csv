4.0,"I never had a chance to taste the 13y BiB but from reading descriptions it seems that the two bottlings don’t differ substantially.  If so maybe the 2y difference in age is was partly negated by a few hotter TN summers... anyway, enough speculation.

The nose resembles roasted pecans and a wonderful vanilla frosted cinnamon roll.  The palate lands with sweetness and then a big kick of cinnamon spice.  There’s mid-sip heat and a mouth coating feeling.  The finish is medium or longer with notes of oak, charcoal, spice, maple and tobacco.  In ways the finish reminds me a bit of the earthy Eagle Rare 10y finish.

Definitely a winner and hopefully becomes easier to find."
