4.0,"Delicious rich plum/sherry sweetness enveloped in a plume of smoke. As the name implies it's ""darker"" than the 12 year, with less honey, more dark fruit sweetness. My complaint is that it's just a bit unrefined. Instead of finishing as luscious as it starts it's a bit acidic in the middle and finishes dry, like you had a great night out but smoked one too many cigarettes. That being said I think it’s the best of Bowmore’s  core range (although I haven’t had the 25 year). $93 in Ontario."

3.0,"Another one that makes me wish Distiller allowed half-stars. This whisky ain't a three, but it's not quite a four; it suffers from many of the flaws of its younger sibling (a faintly synthetic character, weak integration of flavours, gratuitous artificial colouring), but nevertheless manages to be an enjoyable drink. Nose of smoke (BBQ pulled pork), lemon zest, molasses, strawberries and blueberries. Slight red wine acidity or tartness. A touch leafy, herbal, perhaps some tobacco leaf. Body is nice and full (considering the proof), though a bit hot. Red wine sweetness--berries, some orchard fruits--and then a blast of that generic Bowmore smoke (not peaty, not campfire-y, just . . . smoke; like it was created in a lab). A bit of lemon zest (a note shared with the 12 Year Old), a touch of dark chocolate, some grape skins. Sweet turning to dry, with a bit of a smoke-and-mothballs finish--slightly meaty, somewhat woody.The sherry finish and the smoke here aren't super well-integrated, and that's a weakness of the whisky overall. The smell of this stuff is quite lovely, but the taste is a bit all-over-the-map--it doesn't know whether it wants to lead with the fruit or lead with the smoke. A decent value for what you're getting (there just aren't too many affordable sherried Islays), but ultimately nothing to write home about."

3.0,"Nose: Fermented fruit, earth, red wine, tobacco, leather, very muddy and confusing but interesting nonetheless.

Taste: Thin mouthfeel, spent charcoal right off the bat which fades into syrupy dried fruit. Time in the glass and water reveals more orchard fruit and tones down the artificial smoke. Benefits from time in the glass and water.

Finish: Long and drying, the smoke leads into some sweeter notes over time, more oak. The flavors just don't mesh very well here. Such a mucky whisky!

E150 caramel must be used as the color just doesn't seem natural. Not a bad dram but I don't see myself buying another bottle. Disappointed by Bowmore so far."

4.0,"Great whisky, and I think a successful marriage between two headstrong flavour profiles: Islay and sherry. To the eye the colour is gorgeous (I have no clue if there's E150 caramel here, but I will blissfully believe the sherry casks take credit) and amber red. The nose is quite complex, with notes of caramel, smoke and mandarin oranges. The palate and body is sweet and syrupy, with sea salt and a touch of wood. The finish is smooth and prolonged, inviting you to further sips. Well done!"

1.0,"Firm proof that one man's meat is another man's poison. I think this is one of the most unpleasant things I've ever tasted or had the misfortune to smell.

Nose: Overbearing cedarwood and mineral oil and a strong oily aroma that resembles nothing so much as furniture polish - or maybe shoe polish.

Palate: The taste is as unappealing as the nose. A strong cherry cough-syrup and resinous wood flavour resulting from the marrying of very assertively peat-smoked spirit with very active and over-sulphured sherry casks.

Finish: Long. Asphalt, resin and tannin.

This is one of the few ""good"" whiskies I've tasted that I absolute hate. It's not badly made like a cheap bottom-shelf blend, it simply has a profile that is repellent. However that's just my opinion.

I persevered with this but quickly gave up and passed it on to a friend who said he didn’t mind it. 8 months later and he’d still hardly touched it. Out of curiosity after almost a year I sampled a dram and found it to be as unpleasant as I’d first thought.

I have heard that this whisky varies markedly from batch to batch - maybe I just got a particularly bad one.

4.0,"This scotch is billed as Bowmore 15 The Darkest, and it does possess a rich, mahogany color.  But there’s color added, so what does that name even mean?  I suspect “Most Artificial Colorant Added” did not score highly in the marketing focus groups.  All jokes aside, this scotch has a cool and striking note:  chocolate covered pretzel.  It noticed it immediately on the nose and on the palate, it’s that sensation when you crack open a pretzel (yeasty, dry, salty).  Other than that, I get musk, corn oil, plenty of peat, mildly sweet malt, and cherry candy.  The finish is not smoky but rather expresses its sherry finish in the form of some berry or tart fruit and some chewy, woody tannins.  At around $75-80, I’d peg this as the best value and best whisky in Bowmore’s main lineup."

The palate on the other hand isn't bad. There is a nice peat opening on a bed of chocolate covered cherries. Unfortunately, it is milk chocolate and not dark chocolate. Sadly, hovering all the time in the background is the sulphur taste.   The finish is a bit of sherry and a slight peaty woft. This is just not a good whisky. My second Bowmore recently and I have to say they are a big disappointment. My first whisky ever was a brash peaty smoke-filled Bowmore 8 year old. I miss that whisky."

3.0,"I bought this Bowmore 15 a while ago to add to my collection of whiskies with a winey finish and based on their website's touting of two golds and a silver metal in 2016 (Int'l Spirits Challenge, San Francisco World Spirit's Competition, & Int'l Wine and Spirits Competition). Lagavulin DE was a big hit with me and I was hoping this Islay would strike a similar chord when the mood arose. Bowmore describes the color of this spirit as dark amber, which they attribute to 12 years in select American bourbon and 3 years in oloroso sherry. It looks a little synthetic; however, the nose is quite pleasant with a fruity alcoholic mixture one could inhale endlessly. A drying glencairn will produce a plush aroma of antique hardwoods. The palate was dry and a little flat, reminiscent of an oloroso sherry that only has about 1% of the sugar that would be found in a pedro ximenez. I found the spirit devoid of smokiness on both nose and palate and a little disappointing in that regard, but not surprising given sherry’s ability to sometimes strangle peat influence. The finish was short and unremarkable. Overall, a fairly pleasant dram but not up to par for an Islay. I rate it at 3 stars."

3.0,"Review from February 2016 from Barreled 


Certainly lives up to its name. By far the darkest scotch I've had. Does not seem to be too heavily peated and I actually picked up more smoke on the cork than the whisky. Figs and raisins dominate the nose. Very sweet on the palate with some oak coming through. More smoke and a 46% bottling over 43% would have really helped, especially considering the price. Still a complex and good single malt, but just didn’t do it for me. Give it time in the glass. First dram was not as good as the second a month later."

My second taste was slightly redeeming. The unique earthy-peat taste that I get from this bottle is interesting. Other notes I identified are salt, vanilla, and overwhelming dark chocolate. Overall this rich and tasty scotch is in my opinion “okay” 2/5. 

PS: Save your money and get the 12 year. It’s better."

3.75,"Well, after just having a pour of Laphroaig it wasn't like I could.go back to Bourbon. This was the other Islay they had to go with the Bowmore 12. They wanted $10 a pour for both, so of course I chose age! 
Instantly on both the nose and the pallette I know I have a softer beast. 
On the pallette the sweet Sherry and Bourbon notes shine. Red fruits, toffee and vanilla shine thru with the smoke and sea salt. This make the mid palatte and finish taste like a cross between a salted fudge/caramel and taffee. Finish is shorter than the Laphroaig and features more smoke, brine and dried red fruits. 
The best way I can describe this is a poor man's Lag 16. It's similar just doesn't hit the sweet spot in the same way. Better than Laphroaig 10 and worse than Lag 16. That is the extent of my Islay knowledge! For now!"

3.5,"info: une combinaison de ex-bourbon et ex-sherry de premier remplissage. 12 ans dans le premier et 3 ans dans le second. Anciennement appelé le Darkest désormais seulement 15 ans. J'ai en main le Darkest, l'ancienne édition. J'ai aussi gouté la nouvelle au bar et pour être honnête, je ne croyais d'abord pas que c'était le même whisky. Pourtant, tout indique que le procédé est identique. Si c'est seulement la variation entre les batch que j'ai perçu, ça m'a semblé énorme comme différence. Bref, je ne sais pas trop quoi en penser mais, pour ma part, il est clair que les goûts ne goûte vraiment pas pareille. Quatre récompense, les quatre fois l'or en 2013, 2014, 2017 et 2018 (International Wine & Spirit Competition et The Spirits Business). 

Nez: c'est sucré et fumé. Des raisins et des épices. 

Bouche: Doux. fruité. Des dattes ou des raisins secs trempé dans la sauce BBQ. Céréalier. Une douceur derrière sur cette crème céréalière. Texture ok. Impression de dilution. ça parait que ce n'est qu'un finish de 3 ans en fut de sherry. Sans ça, il n'y aurait pas grand chose. Ou est le ex-bourbon? Confondu à travers le finish en sherry. je pense qu'il aurait gagné à s'affirmer pleinement sur le sherry.

Finale: Éphémère. pratiquement inexistante. Fumé et amertume.

Overall: Tandis que la nouvelle édition du 15 était plus boisé et plus sèche en bouche, le 15 darkest est juteux et fruité. tellement juteux que ça semble dilué. Ce n'est pas mauvais. Mais, ça semble être une pâle copie moins complexe du Lagavulin 16. Un peu comme une version plus légère et moins agressive de ce dernier. Je pense que c'est un scotch pour ceux qui débute leur aventure dans la tourbe. Cette tourbe est équilibré avec le sucre des raisins secs. rapport qualité-prix ""ok"" considérant qu'il y a des meilleurs scotch moins cher et des pires plus cher. Pour ma part, je n'ai pas été très impressionné par la gamme de Bowmore en générale et celui-ci n'en fait pas exception. J'y vais donc d'un 72%."

Color: amber reddish, dark, deep
Clarity: clear, pure
Legs: hard forming, low speed, pretty thick and spaced out


Nose: raisins, fruity, sherry, bourbon-y, chocolate 

Taste: sweet, fruits, raisins 

Finish: medium - long, a certain dryness 

Add water:

Nose: vanilla, pear, sweet, honey, smoky

Taste: sweet, peary, fruity, peat - weak, at the end with a little malt, smoke. A bit of dryness.

Finish: pleasantly long

Oddly, there's a more pronounced smell of smoke that stays in the glass after you have finished it than when the whisky is in it.

Body: Balanced, rounded

Makes me think of armagnac.

This whisky is like a trip. Made in Scotland, Islay - it makes you travel way south, in France with a resemblance of armagnac but it gets you back on Islay with a hint of peatiness. It's like a translator: from Scottish Gaelic to French, it translates the roughness of Scotland into the “douceur du sud de la France “ but still keeping its Scottish personality. 

Very well suited, in my opinion, with (as) a desert."

3.75,"Originally posted on Barreled 2/6/19.

Bowmore was my intro to Islay almost two years ago and I really liked the 12 yr. I’ve been wanting to get a hold of this bottle for quite a while and when Ace Spirits had it on sale for Burns Night I jumped on it. 

This 15 year expression is aged for 12 years in ex-bourbon barrels and then another 3 years in Oloroso sherry casks. It’s an absolutely gorgeous dark red/mahogany color in the glass. It’s bottled at 43% ABV and leaves a nice oily coating with abundant legs.

Initially the nose had lots of sherry: dark fruits - raisins, grapes and blackberries, along with a fair amount of smoke. The smoke seemed to intensify after sitting in the glass for about 15 minutes. Really nice. Almost Lagavulin like. 

The palate was a little one dimensional after the nose with dry smoky red wine. It was really hard to pick any individual notes out of it. The finish was decently long with BBQ meats and a little pepper. 

This dram changed pretty significantly with the addition of just a 1/4 tsp of water. Although the water just about killed the nose, it balanced the palate by bringing out more of the sherry against the smoke. It also enhanced the finish somewhat in the same way. 

This whisky is very good, if not just a little one dimensional. The smoke was stronger than I remember with the 12. Unfortunately it’s almost too strong as it tends to overwhelm the sherry notes. Water seems to help this but weakens the wonderful nose. Overall it’s pretty good. I got this on sale at $76; I’m glad I didn’t pay full price. Good but not great. 3.75/5. Cheers"

3.75,good intro to bowmore
1.5,"Bowmore tasting evening at The Oak Barrel, Sydney, June 26th 2019: Whisky #3

Nose: Heavy, dark aromas of baked raisins, roasted nuts, sherry, tar, bitumen, cedarwood, coffee and seaweed.

Palate: A full-bodied but dry arrival featuring resinous wood, brine, treacle and smoke. Dark fudge, sherry, glace cherries and a little licorice appear on the development.

Finish: Medium/long. Meaty and salty with a dark fruit and woody aftertaste.

This is the successor to the old Bowmore 15 year old ""Darkest"". It is essentially the same whisky but there is a subtle difference between the two expressions. It's more like batch variation than a major change.

The old 15 Darkest had an unpleasant aroma combination for me (rubber inner-tubes and furniture polish).  It also had a strong cherry cough-syrup flavour. In combination I used to find this profile very distasteful.

This expression is similar but less intense. The off-putting aromas are subdued and thankfully the cough-syrup quality has largely disappeared.  The character is still woody and resinous but more subtle notes can now be detected. Whether there has been a change to the whisky itself or whether it previously suffered from maturation in unsympathetic casks, it has definitely improved.

However, much as I can see that there is something attractive about this malt for many enthusiasts, and despite the awards it has won and its general popularity, I still find it unappealing. My low rating (raised by half a point since last time) reflects my purely subjective reaction to it.

""Adequate"" : 1.5 stars"

3.75,"Love the (natural?) color - looks like a light brown ale

Nose is a combination of caramel/toffee, unknown pleasant fruit, a touch of smoke - so far so good

Initial taste is sweet but not cloying, a bit of a pepper burn. Give it a few seconds and the peaty smoke emerges, a bit more than subtle but certainly not ashtray-overpowering. A waft of alcohol vapors as it goes down. No complexity in the finish - the sweetness disappears for the most part except for a dash sticking to the upper palette.

Strange: After I wrote the above I was leafing through Distiller (critical research of course!) and I absently took a healthy sip after letting the pour sit for a few minutes. It pretty much bypassed my tongue (so I got no pepper) and went straight into the back of my throat.  It tasted like a spoonful of slightly ashed sugar going down - just wonderful. Now I'm left with a pleasing fruity aftertaste. I'm raising my rating.  Yup, after letting it breathe for a few minutes it jumped from a B- to a B+ in my book.

Really a 3.875

4.25,"On paper this looks good; peat, sherry (ling finnish) and some decent age at a fair price. Let’s see!

Nose: First sniff is heavy Islay peat (smoke, and meaty ash). From second sniff and onward the peat becomes more and more subdued by the sherry notes: tones of jam, dried plums and (orange) marmelade. The peat is still there but turns more into smoked sausage or ham than the initial firey notes. A really deep sniff can also reveal some marzipan notes. At times I also picked up an off note unfortunately, remining me of cheap, fat sausage/hotdogs starting to turn bad. It’s managable and becomes less prominent as I drink the dram, but still a buzz-kill. I noticed this only when I used a small tulip shaped sniffer glass for some reason - I got almost nothing of it in a Glencairn. There is i slight touch if compost as well (which is a neutral remark - it’s not unplessant but rather gives character). Finally, there is a very slight hint of something sour/acidy whish is not too plesant but it’s only noticable on a very ”deep” sniff. 

Palate: The peat is more like hay and smoked ham now, and there is a fruity sweetness covering it. Hints of thick strawberry jam and English orange marmelade on toast. The off note on the nose does not at all carry over to the palate - fortunately.  A light mineral touch is present as well. 

Finnish: A great mix of quite light smoke and dark marmelade fruits lingers for quite some time. Very nice. It’s not like a sherried Ardbeg where the smoke dominates - it’s clearly there, but subtile. After a while, an vague note like the flowey bitterness of many IPA beers comes through - nice and unique. 

Overall: The upsides of this whisky is the great balance between on the one hand the amount and character of the smoke, and on the other the dark and jammy fruits where neither is overpowering. Also, there is very little oak bitterness, which is often a (in my opinion) a negative side effect from heavy sherry maturation. On the downside is of course the sausage off-note, but since I was able to manage it by using a certain glass I’ll disregard it when scoring the whisky. Overall, the nose is good whereas the palate and the finish are really great. In total I give it a very comfortable 4.25, i.e a great whisky. Being a fan of this style of whisky (peat&sherry), I could see this one as a standard on my shelf."

3.5,"For me this whisky is a punch in the mouth.  I had the opportunity to try this whisky again after about a year.  On the nose, the aroma of ash was strong.  Although they call it peat, the aroma of ""peat"" is very different to the peat that I get from an Ardbeg, Talisker, Port Charlotte.  In these whiskies, the peat smells and taste like smoke, BBQ smoke, but in the Bowmore 15, the peat was more of ash, sulfur, which was a little overwhelming.  On the palate, I got some fruit, sherry, but the peat was also strong.  The finish was medium and more ash.  Overall an interesting dram, that I probably would reserve for a time that I am BBQ."
