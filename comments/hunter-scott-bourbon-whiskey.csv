2.0,"Very weak.  On the nose Vanilla and citrus have to be dug for.  Palate very weak flavors.  No finish.  

Smooth with almost no burn.  Would be recommended in a mixed drink where bourbon is not the primary."

1.0,"Weird plastic-like taste on the front, sweet cola on the back end. Very short, disappearing finish"
0.75,"Really funky taste with this one.  It’s smooth, but the plasticy-bitter taste is really off putting. Don’t know what happened here. Tastes very, very young.  Not a fan.  2/10"
