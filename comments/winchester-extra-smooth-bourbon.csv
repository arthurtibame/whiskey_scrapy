1.0,"Bleck, Don't do it."
1.0,"Bought a miniature at Total Wine to give it a shot.  This is one of their ""Spirits Direct"" that they're always recommending.  One of the worst bourbons that I've tasted.  A half a star is being too generous.  If you're looking for an inexpensive bourbon stick with Evan Williams"

4.0,"I disagree with the professional review. I find this bourbon to be very smooth, sweet and creamy. Very little spice IMHO. I would guess this has a low rye percentage, may even be wheated. A surprisingly drinkable, affordable bourbon."

3.0,"Light amber color. Sweet corn and almond on the nose. Candied Apple and leather on the mouth. Dry vanilla and oak undertones. Wet, smooth finish with a slight tingling on the tongue."

3.0,Not sure why there's so much hate on this. Nothing special. But drinkable. A simple monotonous spicy flavor.

1.0,"Very raw, harsh. Caramel to the nose. On tasting there is vanilla , but you have to search for it as it is overshadowed by coarse spice and astringent sawdust. It's obvious this distillery rushed this bourbon out the door. Would not even recommend as a mixer."

0.25,"The ""extra smooth"" moniker is no doubt meant to appeal to new or uneducated bourbon drinkers. The idea of marketing a product as ""extra smooth,"" while there is a more mature version of the same bourbon adjacent to this on the shelf is borderline insulting. The name and packaging are also an obvious nod to the firearms manufacturer - perhaps TerrePURE is making assumptions about the intelligence of gun owners."

null,"Hands-down, the worst bourbon I have ever had. Nearly undrinkable served neat. Went for a second attempt as a mixer and it actually ruined ginger beer. Hard pass, thank God it was a gift"
2.0,ugly... glad I didn't buy a 750 ml bottle.  harsh oak and alcohol finish. nose is faint and elusive to describe -not bad but not at all what I'm used to. taste goes from smooth to harsh oak in 2.8 seconds.  pass on a 2nd dram.

1.0,Would not have this again. Has a harsh bite and nothing worth biting in taste.
1.25,"Young, grassy, strong ‘red hots’ cinnamon smell.  Not pleasant- Harsh alcohol taste masks anything else on the pallet. Bit of grass and hay in the taste- almost like a scotch.  The cinnamon is in finish but is very quick.

Hard pass on this one...so much better is out there in this price range."

4.0,"Smooth for a $25 bottle.  Drinkable on the rocks. Balanced and after almost finishing the bottle plus blind testing against bottles 3x the cost it's the best value I've had this year. Fresh, Green.  Spicy and hint smokey."

0.5,"Wholly in agreement with the tasting notes. 

It’s not awful, there's just not much there. Add a couple drops of cold water and it disappears. 

While this does indeed go down smooth, it really has no other standout qualities. I'd say use it as a mixer, but could it actually stand up to anything you would mix it with?  It's cheap enough, but even at this price point, and below, there's better options. 

Really glad I only got a mini."
