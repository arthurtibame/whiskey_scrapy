4.0,"Not as good as a few other longer aged bourbons like Elijah Craig or Evan Williams Single Barrel, but much easier to find, and very affordable. Initial sweetness is offset almost immediately by a bite of alcohol, then a mouth-coating warmth precedes the finish which is again sweet followed by a lingering alcohol burn.  Mixes great, and works great neat or with a few drops of water.  Beam has a winner here in an affordable, tasty bourbon for those on a budget."

3.0,The nose is pretty standard Jim Beam. The palate is where it surprises you. You find a nice balance of mild sweetness and a little barrel. The extra time in the barrel has helped but overall its still a slightly classier Beam.

1.0,"I was excited to try this Jim Beam after reading some articles about it. It has apparently won awards, and is ranked high among the best tasting bourbons. Frankly, I don't get that at all. I am new to bourbons and am discovering all the differences that make each one different and good in their own way, but this bottle has me scratching my head. First, the nose is almost solely a strong smell of alcohol reminding me of rubbing alcohol. The taste isn't much better, to me, it hits hard and is unforgiving. The burn is from mid-tongue and back, but also encompasses my inner cheeks and roof of my mouth, almost numbing my mouth as if preparing for dental work. I don't mind bourbon burn, in fact I weclome it as long as it brings flavor with it. This burns for burning sake, and I can't get the flavor that makes it one of the best. I'll use the remainder of the bottle for mixing with soda. As I said I'm new to bourbon, and have found that I really like Maker's Mark, Woodford Reserve, and Buffalo Trace. I say that to give you some insight into what I like, and those 3 are all very different, and provide different levels of finish. I would not recommend this bourbon for sipping neat, with a little water, or on the rocks; as none of those experiences were pleasing to me."

The full body of the whiskey and spice balance well, but the bourbon for me is a bit of a dud. I would not reinvest in this bottle, save your change for the signature craft 12, 4 more years makes a big difference."

4.0,"2014 Jim Beam Black Bottles have 8 Year Age Statement (Double Aged) but the 2015 Jim Beam Black Bottles  (Extra Aged) have NO Age Statement or (NAS) which means it could have any Blend from 3 years to 8 years in any type of combination which IMHO makes a Big Difference in the Nose & Taste!

Now this makes Jim Beam Black (Extra Aged) is a 4 Star with NAS instead of The Jim Beam Black (Double Aged) a 5 Star & with The 8 Year Age Statement being MUCH BETTER so look for The 8 Year Old Age Statement & you will have a much better bourbon to enjoy!"

On the palate, All the good stuff from the white label (caramel, vanilla, oak) without the off notes (sour medicinal finish). Now that they've removed the age statement and are simply going ""extra aged"" it's not near as good (and I did a side by side), especially when you consider the other options at about the same price (B Trace, Old Grandad BIB, Elijah Craig 12)."

This is a solid Bourbon that can be found nearly everywhere and is right down the middle in its flavor profile and that is not a bad thing. I was going to compare this with JB While Label but while it is in the family line it is what happens when you leave White Label in longer and don't dilute it as much. This is such a solid drink it should be the first non-wheat bourbon a person being introduced to Bourbon should have. For a wheated Bourbon try Makers Mark or Larceny. Jim Beam Black Label is good in everything I have thrown at it. Neat it is drinkable and smooth with classic Bourbon notes of vanilla, caramel, and wood. It mixes well with coke and ginger ale. It makes a passible Old Fashioned but it does not hold up well in it. Overall, this is such a great drink at its price point I have nothing bad to say about it. Enjoy."
