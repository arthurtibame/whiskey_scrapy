2.75,"Nose - Clean sweet peat, fairly one-dimensional, sweet malty simple syrup

Taste - Clean sweet peat, faint dark raisins, chocolate, dark prunes at the back palate

Finish - Lingering clean sweet smoke, more dark raisins emerge, prunes, dark chocolate

Score - 67/100

Final Thoughts - I guess peat really helps cover up young spirit as finally the raw ethanol vibe is gone here. Sadly the clean peat covers up much of the PX sherry influence on the nose and only appears at the back end of the palate, but luckily lingers through to the finish.

Would I drink it if offered? - Maybe

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"
