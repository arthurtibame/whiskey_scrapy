3.25,"Absolutely nothing amazing, however, there is beauty is how simple this is.  Not offensive in any way.  Saw the bottle and checked the website and felt like I was looking at an ad for high end coolers, fishing, and a up north BBQ.  But that is exactly where I'd love to take this bottle!  Worth the $"

0.5,This one is not a keeper. Very astringent nose and no flavor. Mixed it with lemonade. The bottle makes a bold claim that it “may be the greatest American whiskey”. Hardly. Spend your money elsewhere.

3.75,Smooth. So easy to drink with little burn. Seems decent for the price.
3.75,"Good amounts of rye, decent age, and a pleasant burn.  It’s not a stellar “must have” whiskey, but it’s also not trying to be. One of the best you can have for $20."

3.5,"Wasn’t expecting much, but would buy it again and definitely keep on the shelf. Great for mixing and not a bad sipper"

4.25,"Color is a soft crisp gold. Beautiful average legs. Nose is sweet honey, vanilla, and buttered toast. Palate is soft and sweet; more honey and vanilla with the classic oak underneath. Finish is smooth and warm, with a tiny amount of spice. A classic whiskey with nothing too overpowering nor underwhelming."

3.75,"Very smooth and a great mixer when needed. Love the simple notes of wood and sweetness. Not much to complain about, or leave you wanting - it's just that simple."
2.75,"Not bad. Not complex, a smooth sipping whiskey. Slight bitterness. 12/1/19"

3.25,"Something different.  It is light on flavor, but in a good way, if you're looking for something a little different, for a low price. $20.00 on sale Virginia."

3.5,"Wow, I’m impressed. Thanks @OtisDB!"
4.0,Light. Perfect for hot Texas summers. Great with lemonade.
2.0,"Nothing wrong with it but nothing right either. Mostly just nothing. Slight corn nose and the palette is inoffensive but has nothing going on. Inoffensive is probably the best word to describe this dram. This seems to be engineered to be a hot weather mixer (even has a lemonade cocktail on the bottle) and if so, they nailed it."

4.0,"Very light on the front. You could let this sit on your tongue as long as you want without tasting much. Mild spice, clears fast."
