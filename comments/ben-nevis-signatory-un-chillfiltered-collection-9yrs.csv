3.75,"This is interesting. It’s an odd one, smelling a bit like white wine and the palate doesn’t blow you away with complexity. But it’s different. I could see giving this anywhere from 3-4 stars depending on my mood and taste for the day. But I keep coming back to it. There’s something mildly offputting on the nose...shades of turned white wine. But it only makes the taste better when you finally do take a sip. Lots of light fruit grounded by the 46% abv - getting apples, pear and a sweetness like beeswax with the honey still attached.  The finish is short and not memorable. But it’s crisp. Kind of reminds me of a good hard cider. I don’t think I’d buy another but I’m glad I’ve had it and give some props to the IB for releasing this into the wild. 

Update: nearing the end of the bottle and I’ve finally gotten around to adding a little water - I’d held off since it’s so drinkable without it and I was fearing it would lose potency. A good reminder to always try a drop or two. It really improves the nose and unlocks some wooden spice that was hidden from me. It’s bordering 4 stars with a drop of water and it actually lengthens they finish a bit too. At less than $40 I’d buy this again."
