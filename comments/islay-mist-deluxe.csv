2.0,"Got this as a present, have to admit I was dubious, actually was pleasantly surprised. This would not be a bad way to introduce someone to peated whisky. It is sweet with some smoke and enjoyable. Furthermore, in the spirit of ""So, you'll have had your tea then?” it is inexpensive."

2.75,Not to bad on initial taste but there is a bit of a wrong petrol note going on. After initial hit it fades to nothing pretty quick.  Very cheap though.
