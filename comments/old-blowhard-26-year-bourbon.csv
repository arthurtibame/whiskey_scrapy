2.0,"Vanilla on the nose, salty aftertaste. A bit rough, almost like seawater. Also, a humid seawater nose, like that of old, musty wood. 2.5."

3.75,"Always a treat to drink older whiskies. 
26 years is up there for a bourbon
Nose: Oak, carmel,  fruity, sweetness
...and carries through onto the palate but with less fruit, less sweet
Finish kind of hot for 90 proof??
For the price of a bottle I think large companies like Diageo need to do a better job picking barrels or lower the price when a barrel is not amazing 
26 years sounds nice but is not liquid gold literally & figuratively in Old Blowhards case.
Definitely drinkable but not great BUT SHOULD BE GREAT/ NEEDS TO BE GREAT AT THIS PRICE POINT. 
Stores are ""asking"" $800 
Other ""channels"" are at $600
A pour at $25 a great value BUT still not worth it 

Taste #2 6/16/20
Much of the same but not picking up the heat...up score to 3.75"

4.5,"Lots of wood, thick, nice sweetness. I'm a fan"
3.0,"Medicinal. Smells like a musty basement full of green tea. Drinks waaay to smooth for its proof. Interesting, but not worth the price."
4.0,"Not really an old bourbon kinda guy, but customer suggested this.
Easy drinking as it should be, little bit of sweetness and the oak is not overpowering which is nice.
Fun whiskey."

3.0,"Lots of oak and smoke on the nose with a hint of maple. The taste is very similar with lots of smoke and oak and some spice. The finish though is short and quickly fades away. This is the oldest bourbon I've ever tasted, so I have nothing to compare it to, though I think the price is too high."
3.0,Try not to let the price fool you. It's good but probably over aged. Lots of tannic wood notes in the finish that won't go away. Easy to drink though.
