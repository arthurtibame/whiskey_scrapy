3.5,83 rating is absurd.  Don’t let the silly label fool you.  This is very good.
3.5,"Sweet honey and floral on initial sip.  Coats the mouth nicely.  Smoke and brine follow with some delayed heat.  Interesting blend, wish I knew which scotches were part of it.  Beautiful Chardonnay wine coloring.  Great legs on this one.  Smooth and mild with a bit of a young whiskey burn.  Overall I like it, not well known so it is reasonable.  A good go to when you want a little peaty scotch but don’t want to drink up your good stuff."
3.75,Highly underrated
