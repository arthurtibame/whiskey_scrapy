3.75,"Reese’s peanut butter candy and Orville Redenbacher popcorn on the nose, the same on the palate, also very viscous with a hint of burnt popcorn and macadamia nut liquor, sweet, syrupy short finish"
4.5,"Great tasting peanut butter whiskey.  I would recommend drinking on the rocks, or can be a great mixer."
2.5,There is a strong butterscotch flavor that balances well with the lighter peanut notes. Overly sweet and overpowering to any traditional whiskey flavorings. Would be a great mixer.

3.5,"Hint of whiskey and then buttery nutty peanut butter and sugary taste.  It's definitely wayyyyyy better than Jack Daniel honey but too much of a good thing can be off putting.  Syrupy, great for couple of shots but might make you want to reach for water of you drink a whole glass."
3.0,There is a potent vanilla nose followed by flavors reminiscent of hydrox cookies. The peanut butter notes are subdued. This whiskey isn’t as sweet as I’d have expected.
3.25,Too sweet for me to really enjoy it

4.0,The butterscotch is a lot more potent than the actual peanut butter itself. Smooth when dipped but still has a strong aftertaste. Best on the rocks to mellow out the bold butter flavor.

And I say this whiskey is fantastic. It makes zero sense. But it’s awesome. It somehow blends PB and whiskey in the best way. Fantastic to keep on hand and share with those friends that don’t love whiskey. Great to keep in the fridge or freezer and poured into a salt rimmed glass. Or mixed with chambord to make a PB&J."

4.5,My original thoughts is was that peanut butter and whiskey would not work. This is a very delicious whiskey. It has a very nice peanut butter aroma.  It is very smooth and a little creamy.  There is a heavy taste of peanut butter with hints of whiskey on the tail of tasting it.

3.0,"No surprise here! Nose of Peanut Butter, Buttercream Icing, and Movie Theater Popcorn Butter. Palate is super sweet. And when I say super sweet, I think I can feel Type II coming on after a couple sips. Chocolate and Peanut. Like a Reese Cup, but without the hint of saltiness to tie it all together. I was hoping for a saltier profile more akin to real Peanut Butter. I picked this one up strictly for Sh*** & Giggles to experiment with in some cocktails. My fear is that it may be hard to find something that will cut the cloying sweetness. As far as odd combinations go, this one works much better than the Dickel Tabasco Fiasco."

In fact, if you like whiskey, you  won’t find much - except first hint on nose and color, that resembles your preferred drink. No real whiskey flavor. Absolutely no whiskey bite.

4.25,"4.25? Really????  Yes, BUT...

Screwball is labelled as a whiskey, but it's not (with all due respect to Screwball and their branding and marketing teams).  Like Drambuie, it's a whiskey-based liqueur.  It's syrupy and super sweet, like a peanut butter version of Licor 43.

For those who like peanut butter, have a serious sweet tooth, and prefer to keep the ABV low, this stuff has the potential to be very dangerous.  Liquid crack. It's simply bursting with a sweet peanut butter flavor, which is admirably achieved with natural flavoring.

For me, it's too sweet to drink straight.  While I can tolerate and even enjoy a high level of natural sweetness in a whiskey, this isn't even close.   

Nevertheless, I suspect it would be an excellent mixer.  I have yet to experiment, but I can see it being the basis for an Americanized version of a Rusty Nail (which is Scotch and Drambuie).  In this case, the ingredients could be bourbon and Skrewball.  Let's call it a Rusty Skrew!   Marketing genius, or is it just the Barrell Bourbon Batch 19 talking?  The peanut note in Beam products will never seem the same..."

If you want a (super)sweet and salty ride, buckle up, throw your hands to the air and have fun.   @Scottyemo best describes the experience.  Have fun, play and mix. Add some Chambord.
