1.0,"Appearance: pale straw with light charcoal sediment and high viscosity. 

Nose: Intense, harsh, and youthful for and 11yr. Black pepper, rubbing alcohol, band aid peat, anise, and some faint sweet notes of caramel and raisin from the sherry cask

Palate: salty, bitter with a piercing sharpness. High proof with no balance and a short finish thankfully. 

Really unpleasant"
