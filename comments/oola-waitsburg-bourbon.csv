5.0,this is my favorite bourbon bar none - the slightly higher than average rye content really comes through and leaves a delightful (and unique) finish. Never tasted a bourbon quite like it.
3.0,Leathery and soft on the taste. Light cherry on the nose. 3.5.

3.0,"Nose - Spicy herbal vanilla, rickhouse-like young oak barrel smell, light cinnamon caramels.
Taste - Spicy cinnamon burn, funky sweet vanilla like a sugar-free oaky, mint, pepper caramel, hint of sweet rye bread and maple syrup.
Finish - Lingering spice, sweet herbal funk lingers, dry splenda-like oak sweetness, rye bread and maple syrup.
Score - 70/100
Final Thoughts - So I'm not sure if my batch is older than their website description, but I did not get the cherries they mention. I get the impression that this is a fairly young bourbon and get quite a bit of young oak and young spirit bite from this. It tasted like a blend of young & slightly older as I got the young bit, but also a silky, mellow, maple syrup-like mouthfeel. Not too bad neat, but I think this would be best in a cocktail to help mellow out the young spirit harshness."

Sweet vanilla flavor. Bright oak, brighter than usual but it's a good flavor. Pop of flavor, super forward."

3.0,Some difficult notes on the finish take away from a reasonable nose and good initial flavor.
1.75,"Thin mouthfeel,followed by a short finish. I wish there was more going on here but it’s a fleeting experience over all. Glad this was a gift."
3.75,"smokey, with a piney kind of bite."

2.5,"Nose: I mostly got oak and a little vanilla, maybe a bit of floral smell but not much. Ethanol smell was there too
Palate: kind of thin, mostly was tasting a spicy vanilla/caramel kind of flavor?
Finish: pretty harsh alcohol on the finish, personally not noticing much else

This glass is about halfway down the bottle, it’s gotten a bit of air into it by now. Not terrible but not very complex, also really not a fan of the harsh aftertaste. I’ve had barrel proofs with less alcohol harshness on the finish. I enjoy mixing this but as a neat bourbon not my favorite. Picked this up on a whim but will probably pass next time, especially for the price."

3.25,"Upon further inspection,and more time to breathe,the whiskey exhibits a vanilla sweetness with a light brown sugar finish."
