3.0,"Sweet brown sugar in nose and in color. Thin mouth feel, but smooth on the tongue thanks to age and experience. Not as peaty as I prefer, but easily drinkable. 
Clinkies!"

3.75,I had the pleasure of sharing the final drinks of this bottle with the amazing woman who received it as a gift. This was a very soft scotch for lovers of a more earthy and smooth drink of scotch. I never felt overwhelmed with flavor or aroma and enjoyed every sip. Bravo Talisker
