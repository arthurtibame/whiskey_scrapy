The palate is dry but dosed with some sweet flavors like cream soda, vanilla, and charred sugars. The heat teeters on too much but instead gives the whiskey a healthy pulse."

4.75,"Nose- Spiced apples, coconut, caramel, vanilla, freshly toasted oak

Palate- Spice and black pepper initially, buttery popcorn, red apples, french vanilla, cherry

Finish- Long, bold finish that has a predominant note of black pepper spice with a slight buttery note

Mmm. The palate really shines on this one. Nose is very balanced and not bad by any means, but the palate shines here. You’re hit with a wave of spiciness, followed by awesome flavors of popcorn, apples, and cherries. A final wave of spiciness washes over all the fruity flavors and leads to one of the longest finishes i’ve ever had."

4.5,"Was pleasantly surprised by the taste of this Mic Drop 4. Excellent mixture of sweet and spicy with maple syrup nose. Surprised it’s so much higher in corn with the spicy taste, but a really solid pour"

5.0,"Awesome “bourbon”! Great nose of vanilla, butterscotch, carmel with a hint of spice. Tastes as good as it smells with a complex flavor profile and a moderate to long finish. One of my favorites. Too bad it’s limited production. Once it’s gone, it’s gone for good. If u can find a bottle, get it. Well worth the $100 price tag."

5.0,"Incredible bourbon flavor bomb! Drink it if you can find it.

Nose: Caramel, sandalwood, macadamia nuts

Palate: Starts with a little spice, sandalwood, toasted banana, macadamia nuts, little sweetness, toasted coconut, and brandy like fruitiness. Such a flavor bomb, so many complex flavors at once, hard to name them all. Amazing! 

Mouth: Creamy. 

Finish: Medium to long, lingering sandalwood and macadamia nuts, caramel."

4.75,"1st taste: Very rich, caramel apples and baked cinnamon spice on nose. Vanilla, heavy alcohol, needs to sit for minutes. Dense caramelized sugars, intermingled baking spices, caramel apple, brown sugar/Maple and barrel dryness on finish.
2nd: Less apple, some banana? More barrel influence on palate but retains dense sweetness and less burn."
