3.5,"Did you ever try new-make? After 11 years in a lazy refill cask, this independent bottling of Old Pulteney remains utterly spirit-driven. Clean, light and very citrusy, the aroma starts with cereals, sour grapes and mint leaf before subtle notes of yeast, white fish and salt emerge. The arrival is crisp, herbal and sparkling, followed by unripe pears, honey and distant tannins in the development. Not very complex, but enjoyable. Over-brewed tea, lemongrass and Ika Mata accompany the minty-fresh aftertaste. This Single Malt would make a great toothpaste!
