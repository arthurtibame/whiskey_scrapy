2.5,"The nose is surprisingly like cardboard (not mildewed). There's something a bit full and fruity in the nose as well with an appropriate but understated sweetness. There are also some floral and vanilla notes. It's an interesting nose. The palate has a lot of vanilla in it - to the point that it is almost overpowering. Or maybe it is. There's something a bit woody that just skirts being harsh and reminds me a tad of Amontillado Sherry. It tastes a bit like formaldehyde or turpentine - and to be clear, I do NOT mean that it has a lot of tannins (though it does have some of those as well). Still, it's a nice woody flavor. It seems like an acquired taste and while it doesn't broadcast old age, it does demonstrate solid execution on an interesting concept. This is an odd one, but is fairly decent. It's a tad thin, but it still has a fairly medium viscosity. The vanilla fades a bit, but is still extremely strong. The wood and bourbon barrel spice definitely make it through. Somehow, the Oloroso barrels mellow the bourbon barrels a bit without making this taste excessively fruity. Yeah, it's a bit wonky, but like Laphroaig 10, it all kind of works out in the end. The flavors do clash a little bit and they don't totally hide the youth, but there's definitely some age in this one and there's a fair bit of complexity with some interesting flavors, many of which are good. It's a bit more than it should be, but it's decent."

4.0,"Spicy sherry, vanilla and honey on the nose, the palate follows the nose with a smooth and creamy mouth feel, spicy medium finish. A splash of water adds a sandalwood scent to the nose while muting the spice, adds oak to the palate and makes it smoother and creamier. Fantastic!"

4.0,"A solid Irish Whiskey, it brings a little more spice being aged in the bourbon barrels. However, those same barrels bring a little more depth to this offering. The sherry cask rounds out the sharp edges nicely, keeping this a very drinkable Irish whiskey with a light, smooth finish. Vanilla and honey up front, mild spice with dark fruit in the middle, and a light caramel finish at the end."
