3.0,"Good nose and pallet flavors accurately depicted below, but not well blended a all a bit to subtle. Definitely not worth the price. The 9yr is WAY better. 

Old fitz is still a classic though..."
4.5,Damn good

4.5,"Nose- Sweet fruit pastries on the nose. Medium Oak.
Palate- Fluffy mouthfeel. Fruit tart. brown sugar, vanilla, pastry and baking spice on the initial and mid palate.
Finish- Long caramel into apple. lingering oak."
2.0,No complexity. Boring front end and invisible finish. Would rather drink a rail bourbon on ice.

4.25,smooth caramel and slight apple with oak and heat on the finish
5.0,"Incredible wheater!!! Sweet, smooth.... must buy if you’re lucky enough to find it."
4.25,A whiskey that started off with extreme tannins but softened and sweetened once opened in about a weeks time. Heavy oak favors gave way to strong vanilla and sweet caramel notes. Barely any heat on the throat. Tremendously smooth yet weighty on the palate.

4.5,"This evening we decided to wind down with a gem of a find from our trip to Bardstown this weekend: Old Fitzgerald Bottled in Bond 13 Year. This particular bourbon is bottled at 100 proof and is distributed by Heaven Hill. It’s a beautiful deep caramel color, smells of cinnamon and baking spice with distinct nutmeg notes. Our first sips revealed mild hints of vanilla and almond with an overwhelming cinnamon and that same nutmeg, though the cinnamon was stronger in the tasting than the smell. It was fairly smooth, with only a slight burn. Finished out with just a slight smokiness and oak lingering on the tongue. We’ll definitely be hunting for more!"

4.75,"The nose is Warm fresh from the stove caramel, and hints of vanilla. Once in the mouth it has a Medium body taste with more caramel and the finish is long warm honey with a touch of lingering oak"
4.0,"Nothing complex about this one - a straightforward, nicely aged wheater. Butterscotch and hints of apple on the nose. Oak joins on the palate. Faint alcohol burn. Long, mellow finish. A pleasant sipper."

4.25,"I liked this quite a bit but maybe not worth it at the price point?  

Nose: Very traditional wheated bourbon.  Vanilla, caramelized sugars, grassy herbaceous notes, a little ethanol punch but not too heavy.

Flavor:  Sweet vanilla and caramel with roasted nuts like pecans.  Buttery mouth feel.  This definitely expresses why wheated bourbons take to long aging so well.

Finish: Not as long as I would have expected with more sweet vanilla notes and some wood and smoke plus more toasted nuts.

Overall this was a solid wheated bourbon but didn't knock my socks off.  If this were a $50-$75 bottle and easily obtained I could see this being a regular pour but at MSRP over $130 and secondary well over $300 I'll probably stay away."

4.5,"I completed a fun blind tasting flight which pitted this Bourbon against the Old Fitzgerald 9 yr old and the Old Forester Birthday Bourbon 2019 blind. The 9 yr old was a distant third and this the Birthday Bourbon were very close with the Birthday Bourbon coming out on top. Let's dive into the tasting notes on this one:

The entry is pretty delicate but a nice mouthfeel with initial notes of vanilla and butterscotch that quickly moves to an array of dried fruits (predominantly berries). Mid palette adds some caramel apple and oak leading to a long oak, tobacco and again more dried fruit driven finish. 

This experience was as pleasant as it was unexpected for a Wheated Bourbon. Completely different to the 9 and 11 yr and definitely the best of the Old Fitzgerald line that I have tasted to date. If you can somehow find it now for close to it's $130 SRP I'd definitely recommend a buy! Cheers all!"

4.75,"Nose: smells like pappy. A little more floral though. But definitely smells like a wonderful wheater. 
Palate: so rich of tobacco like 1792 full proof but so sweet at the same time. Very balanced and really amazing. Just wow though. I need another. 
Finish: almost blueberries like pappy. To me it’s very similar. Vanilla intertwined too in there"

4.5,"A generous taste courtesy of Pie Chef Guy.

To simply start off... Wow! This whiskey has fangs and flavor aplenty. It starts with the strong scents of cinnamon, fresh bread and lightly of pudding. The taste is spicy and lightly fruity. There are notes of a sweet pound cake. The finish is peppery with a lingering heat and touches of vanilla."

4.5,"I was able to pick this up from my favorite local store for MSRP ($130), thanks Don!
The bottle leaked a little on the walk home, when I opened the bag, it smelled like heaven! Any thought of saving it for a special occasion went out the window.
It is a lovely dram - I wouldn’t pay the ridiculous markup some stores are gouging their customers for, but if you can find it close to MSRP, jump on it!"

4.25,Sweet vanilla on the nose. Smooth from start to finish across the pallet. Oak and slight smoke on the finish.
4.0,"Very solid. Tried thanks to an ice from Branden Irvine. Very smooth, vanilla with a little bit of a nut/oak flavor. Incredibly smooth throughout. Would buy at $130 but probably would stay away at full secondary"

4.75,"Neat.  Vanilla and oak lead the nose with a hint of nuttiness.  Cream and berries.  Cherries and maybe raspberries.  Lots of these light, bright notes wrapped around the oak evening it all out.

Really thick on the tongue, surprisingly so.  Great flavor on the tongue.  Sugar, powdered sugars, and those cherries and berries covered in a bit of maple.  Finish brings in all the oak and vanilla.  There is almost a pastry shell taste to the legs.

Beautiful bottle.  Beautiful wheater."

4.5,I’m tasting this next to the 9yr which I love. The nose on this one is totally different. Soft smooth vanilla and cake. Great viscosity. Classic wheated perfection. Not much heat at all. Vanilla soft oak and a little char. One of my new favs.

4.75,"Nose- butterscotch, peaches, caramelized sugars, seasoned oak, toffee

Palate-honey on the palate initially, peanut butter, caramel for days, vanilla, white cake, touch of oak and spiciness throughout

Finish- Long, creamy finish with beautiful notes of caramel, spice, and sweet honey

This is amazing. An upgrade to the already amazing 9yr. Nose is great- although a little hot for 100 proof. Palate and finish are fantastic. Perfectly balanced and what every wheated bourbon should strive to be like."

2.75,"Weird herbal menthol taste upfront, forgettable finish."
4.0,"The color is a dark and lush amber that coats the glass in heavy waves of oils. The nose is soft with gentle oak, dark chocolate and fruit with hints of rich creaminess of vanilla and caramel with notes of spiciness. The palate is rich and turns dry the longer you hold it in your mouth. It is oak forward in a very pleasant way along with a peppery fruitiness, while the creamy notes of vanilla sweet caramel keep it balanced. The finish is medium with a lingering spicy oakiness, while the richer notes fade nicely, leaving behind a wonderful mouthfeel of dark chocolate. The whiskey is held back by its nose being too subtle and finish that sadly doesn’t last long enough to compliment the great palate."

2.0,"13yr woodier still, almost to the point of varnish on the nose. Still some Carmel, which I like.  Peanut butter. Yep, second sip says “thin peanut butter”.  A healthy dose of ice sweetened up quiet a bit. Made it almost enjoyable."

4.25,Neat pour at Planters house. Hints of sassafras on the finish. A bit pricey
4.0,Great wheated BiB! Vanilla and caramel with a short clean finish.
