4.5,"Neat. Neck pour. Nose is light and bright.  The age is only hinted at in the tail end of the nose.  Caramel and butterscotch.  Hint of spearmint.  Hint of apple or even pear too.

Oily feel despite the lower proof.  Apple, sugar and cinnamon on the tongue.  Vanilla flips to butterscotch on the taste with lingering oak and cherry.  Vanilla and cherry lingers with a pronounced sweetness on the legs.

I was expecting an experience close to Boone County 1833 but it is quite difference.  The oak is turned down and the sweetness is amplified.  Might be the sweetest bourbon I have had.  It’s really delicious!"

4.25,"Lone Whisker 12 Year MGP Tasting Notes:

Nose: It’s a symphony of cream, fruits, and cocoa

Mouth: oily, MGP for sure, slight oak, more fruit and cream. Almost a citrusy, floral note. The longer you hold it, the more apparent rye spices come through. No burn here. None. Silky smooth. 

Finish: I’m getting honey, more citrus, some dark chocolate. No Kentucky hug. Smooth all the way down. Amazing. 

This juice plays like a 3 act play. It’s extremely good and I found out it is rare: 2000 bottles a year, released once a year, MSRP: $150"

5.0,"ZVAUGHN’s post is spot on.  

I recommend trying this bourbon if you can find it.  This is a truly limited production (supposedly 2000 bottles annually).  

It is priced on the high side, likely due to the limited production run.  Ultimately, the question of ‘is it worth it?’ is subjective.  If you are looking for the best bourbon at a reasonable cost...this probably isn’t your purchase.  If you want an interesting bottle on the shelf with really good bourbon inside, and you can part with 2 bills...this is one to try."
5.0,"As a 12-year-old Kentucky bourbon blend of 74% corn, 21% rye and 5% malted barley, with 93.8 ABV proof, Lone Whisker pours golden amber and delivers all the bold flavor notes and understated nuance you would expect from a high-end bottle. Each sip uncovers the increasing complexity of a master craftsmanship, helmed by Kent Jarman.

The nose: Initial bright citrus notes of orange burn off quickly to reveal underlying toast and chocolate.

The taste: Be prepared for smooth spices and oak, along with lingering darker fruits and the promise of dark chocolate from the nose fulfilled in the finish, as balanced as it is bold.

There is a noticeable heat from start to finish that brings each phase of flavor into refined focus of depth and distinction, each note tasted as if played as a scale ascending to meet the root note of the major chord shimmering softly behind it all. This is sipping whiskey to be enjoyed at leisure and in good company."
