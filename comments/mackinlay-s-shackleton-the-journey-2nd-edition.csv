2.0,More like a questionable night of hot wax dripping on your chest versus a comforting warm bath with your love. Floral and he wants me to finish it off... it’s gargle material
4.75,"The nose is gentle and is strong of straw and beach sand, with honey and vanilla balancing it out. Those flavors open up richly on the palate and coat the mouth, making for a simple but delicious experience. The finish is long with pepper that keeps the mouth warm as vanilla and straw slowly fade."
4.0,"Nose - Light to mild peat, creamy apples, light vanilla, buttery custard, very light nose

Taste - Creamy mouthfeel, light peat, hint of white pepper tingle, creamy custard, bright green apples, light vanilla butter caramels

Finish - Creamy, lightly dry, waxy, light heat, light fruity bitterness, wisp of smoke, refreshing green apple cisp sweetness that transitions to an apple custard sweet

Score - 83/100

Final Thoughts - This is quite pleasant. It's a very light style Scotch blend that reminds me a bit of Highland Park 15. The peat is subtle and the main flavors are really green apple and a buttery/waxy vanilla custard. Reminds me of the mouthfeel of a nice waxy Clynelish but I don't think there's any of that in here. Regardless, this is nice, not something I'd really reach for since peat isn't my thing, but it's subtle enough and is nicely done.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - Maybe if it was $50-60 USD?"

null,"Slight Peaty and buttery on the nose, you can definitely smell the hint of sand. It's not too strong on the palette, but the vanilla, saltiness, spiciness and brininess stand out in combination remarkably well. On finish, the taste of spice and saltiness lingers a bit longer, with a good floral finish. All in all a top notch blended scotch."
