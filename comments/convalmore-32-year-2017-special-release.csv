4.5,"This whiskey was distilled in 1984 and true to the era it is as rich as Jonathan Hart and as charming as Remmington Steele.

The official Distiller tasting notes are bang-on in my opinion. I get a waxy honey nose with some butter and wood shavings. There's a tingle of salt and pepper on the palate with a creamy buttery note. The finish has spice and lingering oak, that is not at all forceful or bitter.  It reminds me of a Midleton VR or Barry Crockett.

I had this at a Diageo Special Releases (2017) masterclass last year and for me this was the best from a bunch that included Teaninich 17yo, Blair Athol 23yo, Glen Elgin 18yo, and the JW Blue G&R Port Ellen. I'm having it again now because I was successful in sneaking some out in a sample bottle. I love it when a plan comes together!"
