4.25,"Received as a graduation gift from my pops. First “good” Irish whiskey I’ve had. Drank out of a glass and let sit for about 10 minutes. 

Nose: Fruity, berries. A bit of peach. And a tad of honey. Reminded me of cognac in a way. 

Taste: Like the sweet side of spices. Fruity with some bite. 

Finish: A smooth, slow burn. Definitely a whiskey but not harsh whatsoever."

4.0,"Very sweet nose, sugared shortbread cookies and light fruits. Sugar cookies on the taste, followed by mustiness."
4.0,I wish there were more single pot stills out there. This one counts.
4.0,"Appearance: The color in this beautiful Irish whiskey is a light caramel hue. Legs within are thin and watery.

Nose: Fruity and sweet are my first impressions of the nose. Notes of plum, cherry, red wine, fresh cut hay, buttered toast, coconut, sunscreen, and snickerdoodle cookies all make their appearance and weave throughout each other. Also, I find the more I let it sit, the more it opens and starts to smell like an Old Fashioned with an orange peel garnish. An added splash of water creates more floral and honeyed, walking-through-the-woods-in-the-rain-on-a-warm-day note.

Taste: The palate also has a fruity first impression. There are notes of red apples, Twizzler candy, cinnamon sugar toast, and salted caramel. A splash of water brings out notes of yeasty sourdough bread and orange tang.

Finish: There is slight heat at first, easing into a mellower medium length, orange citrus finish.

Thoughts: Oh my gosh! I am so very impressed with this whiskey and it is easily my new favorite Irish, at least. I highly recommend it and would be happy to buy it again. Thank you Midleton, for this delight! Sláinte!"

Very complex nose, very sweet, a personal favorite nose. Touch of smokiness hidden. A short sweet creaminess on the palate then dominated by spice and toasted wood. Citrus note appears as well, orange peel. A bit of smokiness. Long aftertaste of wine, walnuts, toasted wood, and malted barley."

Palais : salé et amer, presque acide, noix de coco, vanille, brioché, citron, légères épices, chêne après coup, une légère fumée boisée 
La finale est moyenne, sèche et vanillée puis laisse place à une note de coco

Note personnelle : 82

Un whisky sympathique sans pour autant tirer son épingle du jeu si ce n’est par sa touche de coco assez originale, à part cela un léger manque de rondeur, de complexité et des notes acides froides et métalliques qui ne plairont pas à tous.
Cela reste tout de même un bon whisky dans l’ensemble, pas désagréable"

4.0,"Fruity, a little peppery spice and sweets. Just as delicious as the Glenmorengies I recently tasted, the Quinta Ruban and the Lasanta, but a tiny bit less sweet and drier. The sweetness seems better integrated, not that sugary. Little bit salty as well. Definitely more oak. Love this one. 
That said, I am afraid that every single 12 year old sherry or port casked whiskey I buy will taste wonderfull, with differences way less obvious than most reviewers ever going to admit. 
This Irish whiskey could easily be a Scotch and in a blind tasting I would have a moderately hard time distinguish this one with say, Glenmorangie's Lasanta. But for now this Redbreast appears to be my favorite. But I could easily live with any of them. (So why not stick with one type bottle?)"

5.0,"I thought it high time I did another head to head tasting. This time around I'll be reviewing the four widely available expressions from Redbreast: the 12 year, 15 year, Lustau edition, and the 12 year Cask Strength (CS). I'd love to include the 21 year in this lineup but my wallet can't handle that sort of hit. If any of you fine folks would be willing to send a sample it'd be most appreciated. I'm also curious as to your opinions on my rankings and whether or not you'd rate these differently. Redbreast is one of my favorite whiskey brands and any of their expressions are worth having in your collection.

The classic Redbreast 12 pours into the glass with a beautiful golden color. The nose has beautifully layered aromas that dance between the biscuity pot still malts and the sherry casks. This one is a classic for a reason. While I'm normally wary of 40% abv offerings, this one seems like that's the right fit (after having fiddled around with the CS for a time). The taste is lovely, with just a little nip from the alcohol and smooth, buttery texture that warms your body as it goes down. The finish lingers nice and long. A supremely drinkable dram, and the benchmark for the rest of the line. I could drink this all day.

For today's tasting I'm rating this #1  out of 4."

2.5,"It’s funny to me, that I’m over 500 whisky reviews deep and I’ve yet to officially review this Irish whiskey staple:  Redbreast 12.  I’ve even reviewed a few other offerings from Redbreast- just not the 12.  I keep thinking that I’ve tried this before, but then again maybe I haven’t.  Weird.  Anyway, this sample was sent to me by my buddy @Generously_Paul, from Michigan.  It’s bottled at 40% ABV, is triple distilled, chill filtered and probably has added color that makes it lightly coppered in the taster.  It makes some fat, yet undefined legs after a spin and leaves behind medium sized droplets clinging to the lip.  It also looks rather watery, in general.

The nose starts out spicier than I anticipated.  There’s a healthy dose of vanilla, nut bread and citrus peel.  I don’t get much, if any, sweetness but then again I didn’t let this one sit very long.  Some barrel cask presence sent a quick sting up my nose as I has going in for the first sip.  Speaking of sips, the Christmas spices and something equivalent to rye spice launched onto my tongue very quickly- it also caught me off guard.  After a bit of a roll, the spice note subsided and warm oak and vanilla settled in along with a nutty almond back end.  It’s pleasant enough, albeit a tad harsh- even at 40%. The finish was short and still spicy, but left plenty of vanilla lingering for a bit.  A sip of water a few moments later washed it all away.  There’s zero staying power with this whiskey.

Overall, I seem to be very unimpressed with most Irish whiskies: except for West Cork and Bushmills.  Redbreast, Teeling and Jameson don’t inspire me into buying more of their offerings.  None of these are bad whiskies, they all just seem a little too tame for me.  This particular 12 year old is the ultimate middle of the road dram IMHO.  2.5 stars.  Cheers."

3.25,"The beginning of the whiff is totally a bourbon, but the end of the whiff is a highland scotch. Left me confused about what to expect.

Definitely no bourbon in the taste, no vanillas or caramel. Toffee is there. This Irish is as middle as they come honestly: not too harsh, not too sweet, not too light, not heavy at all.

Finish is pretty smooth. Don’t know if I’d buy a whole bottle tho. I’d probably buy the bottle for one of those sissy friends who can’t really handle the full scotches, ya know?"
3.75,"Oh, Redbreast. If I were a poet, I would write a sonnet about you. But I’m not, so here’s an average whiskey review. This Irish is more full than most, but not robust, by any means. Pleasantly sweet, but refreshingly not suuuper sugary sweet. I could actually drink this for an extended period of time. Heavy on the toffee, but I’m perfectly fine hanging out there. Sherry character is pronounced, and it avoids the sulfur follow-up characteristic of some other sherried whiskeys I’ve had. Can barely taste the alcohol, and smooth as all get out. The finish lingers. Fantastic Irish."

So Zues is sitting at the table with Ares , Apollo, Athena and the other gods after a big feast. He says now we drink! The servants bring out the glasses and pour a dram of the most wonderful nectar in all the lands. Dionysus peeks under the serving cart and spots the bottle of Redbreast 12 and smiles................Yes its only 80 proof and yes its expensive but the buttery creamy pot still texture is sooooo smooth you wont care. Doesn't matter if you're a bourbon, rye, scotch or any type liquor guy you can fall in love with this. Not overly complex or a whiskey you need to dissect instead its the most approachable pleasant whiskey out there. Pour this for anyone, pure happiness in a glass. Tasting notes are just not necessary other than distilled joy...........93/100..........ok a few notes... Its soft and sweet with honey and caramel with perfect amount of oak.

4.0,"Nose: bready and light, the unmalted barley really helps offset the overly yeasty nose that many single malt scotches exhibit, hints of oak, vanilla, caramel and honey

The nose and palate both are quite bright while also maintaining a complexity and richness. 

Palate: quite rich, as the age really shines in those oloroso sherry casks, and the single pot still opens up those grains; very balanced, and not too malty, nice vanilla spices and hints of citrus 

Finish: medium but the 80 proof drizzles down very smoothly. 

One of the richest 80-proof whiskeys you’ll taste. It’s quite impressive.  This is also a great starter whiskey for bourbon fans to try when they want to branch out."

Where Christmas music is playing and there’s flour all over the place and your grandma has her apron on wielding a rolling pin like a surgeon’s scalpel? Redbreast is about baking. It’s about dessert. It’s about comfort.

Nose: Butter, sugar cookies, vanilla, the slightest lemon peel

Taste: it’s creamy. It’s coconut and caramel. Gosh it’s so good.

Slightest spice on the finish."

4.0,"Redbreast 12 pours Oily and Clingy into the Glencairn.
Nose: The nose is mild, but complex. Malt and Fruit forward. Apple, Pear, Grape. A hint of Citrus (think Icebox Lemon Pie). Oatmeal with Brown Sugar, Sherry, Pencil Shavings, Fresh Paint, and Oak. Lots of great smells that I can't quite pin down. The longer it stays in the glass the more the Brown Sugar Sweetness dominates. I could nose this for hours.
Neat: Nice Heavy Oily Coating Mouthfeel. A little Black Pepper tingle at first, fading to Grape, Milk Chocolate, Marshmallow, Coconut, and Pencil Shavings. There is a little Bitterness. Just the mildest heat on the finish. Mild Malty Sweetness coats and lingers. Much like the nose, the palate gets sweeter with time.
Splash: Really makes the Brown Sugar prominent on the nose. Vanilla and Brown Sugar take center stage on the palate.
Verdict: Really Good, but not Great. Just can't quite bring myself to give it that quarter star, but it's oh so close. I'd love to try this in cask strength as I think it would make some of the more subtle notes bolder. I do not regret the $65 price tag, but I will make this bottle last a while at that price."

4.5,Fruity.
4.25,"Nose: Underripe oranges, green apple, shortbread cookies.  Creamy - that pot still mustiness is really well balanced here.  Vanilla.  Crème brûlée.  Earthy nutmeg and allspice. Figs.  Cocoa.  Sweet, but in a delicate sense.  Very friendly and inviting without being flat and boring.

Palate: There's that soft, creamy. sweet vanilla again.  Earth, nutmeg, and allspice slowly give way to the most understated cinnamon note.  Coffee, a little leather, milk chocolate.  This is mostly mid palate - not necessarily a bad thing.  The sherry cask shows up, along with subtle tannin character.  Finish starts off with chocolate covered coffee beans and orange zest.  That slowly turns into bitter chocolate ice cream, but with a little more vanilla than usual.  Slowly everything disappears from the bottom up - eventually left with bananas, orange peel, and then finally cocoa powder.

Other notes: I am really glad I'm revisiting this.  I recognized the quality here the first time I had this, but I sold it short due to my own preconceptions with Irish whiskey.  Coming back to this with a more open mind has given the a chance to recognize just how good this stuff really is.  The execution with this stuff is top notch.  Every single person I've suggested it to has had the same reaction - ""Woah"".  Well worth having a bottle on hand."

4.5,"This one is truly a lovely whiskey.  The flavors are rich and balanced overall, displaying red fruit, honey, clove, toasted cereal. While there is a noted creaminess in the mouth, to me it is less than the Green Spot. This also has slightly more heat and has a slight astringency on the finish---not uncommon in sherry finishes."

5.0,I might be biased cause this is my first dram after a dry week AND I drank it while watching the return of Conor McGregor but damn Redbreast is a damn great whiskey. Amazing fruity light notes on the nose and a beautiful vanilla cookie taste that fades into an almost strawberry finish. It's amazingly creamy and light. I've still got some left in the glass because I just can't finish it as fast as other whiskeys. It deserves more respect than that.

I get and wonderful sweetness of light fruits on the tail, apple and pear, which is longer than expected. I like this better than the 15 personally."
4.5,The sherry notes come through with a mild sweetness of dried candies fruit. Easily one of the best Irish whiskeys available.
4.5,Finally an Irish that I would drink regularly. While mild and light there is some complexity here to make it unique. I find orange marmalade and brown sugar up front with dried cherry and burnt toast on the finish.

4.25,"Despite being aged only in sherry casks, this whiskey isn’t a sherry bomb. It only gives hints of cooked fruits and spices as a counterpoint to your standard Irish shortbread cookie flavors. Adding a bit of water brings out some pronounced buttery notes which are great. Adding an ice cube really brings out the sweetness. All-around enjoyable.

It’s not as smooth as I’d like it to be. Still a little spiky and phenolic. Makes me wish I had enough to shell out for a higher age statement, but the bottom-rung version is overpriced enough."

4.5,"Redbreast 12 is a Single Pot Still Irish Whiskey, triple distilled in copper pot stills, and matured for at least 12 years in American ex-bourbon and Spanish Oloroso sherry casks. This maturation process instills the robust and complex sherry style distinctive qualities that are truly breathtaking. Made from a mash of malted and unmalted barley, Redbreast 12 is bottled at a gentle 80 proof/40% ABV.

Color: Copper Gold

Nose: Rich fruitiness, red berries, sherry, nutty (almonds/cashews), creamy sweetness, floral, and toasted wood.

Palate: Silky and smooth, red berries, buts, charred oak, leather, sherry, creamy, and mild spiciness.

Finish: Long and spicy, lingering sherry, leather, and toasted wood."

4.25,"Thought I'd celebrate St. Patrick's Day with my second pour from my bottle of Redbreast 12. After this review, I went back and read my notes from the first tasting and I don't know if I've ever had two reviews sound so close together. For some reason I enjoyed it a tick more this time, so it earned that extra quarter star.

NOSE: Love it. Sweet. Cola, Fruit, Honey, Melon, Oatmeal with Brown Sugar. A little Leather and a Floral note round it out. After some time in the glass, the nose is dominated by warm Sticky Brown Sugar and Butter.
NEAT: Decent Clinging Mouthfeel. Sweet. Dessert-Like. Cooked Apples with Brown Sugar and a sprinkle of Cinnamon. Pralines, Sweetened Cream, and Honeycomb. An odd, but not unpleasant note of Pencil Shavings. A Little Bitter or Sour Note on the finish. A slight warming on the way down with Vanilla Sweetness coating. A hint of the Sourness also remains. I get very little Barrel Influence in this.
SPLASH: A little water doesn't change much, but it does reduce that sourness a little. However, it does so at the expense of some of the more complex palate notes.
VERDICT: Like I said, this whisky must be pretty consistent pour to pour as my notes were very similar from 1st pour to 2nd. This is still my favorite Irish so far."

4.0,Great Irish whiskey - so smooth. A little of a classic Irish whiskey taste to it but not at all bad.
3.75,"The nose is raisins and toffee.  On the palate: sherry notes balanced by honey - and also the oak, coming across as shortbread.  The shortbread continues very briefly on the mid-palate, before the finish when the oak gets slightly bitter. The baking spices then make an understated appearance.  The spice does intensify into a warming sensation if you quaff away back to back sips.   But it's mellow and held back by the low 40% ABV.  Like all good ex-sherry casked whiskies, this makes for a great cold weather drink, but it can be perfectly agreeable during the warmer months as well.

The Redbreast 12 is a standard among sherried whiskies.  With a friendlier palate than another standard, the Macallan 12 Sherry Oak, this is a reliable dram for a movie or happy hour event.  It's a whiskey that doesn't take you on much of a journey.  You don't have to spend a lot of time picking at it's nuances.  It's good and simple.

2.75,"Nose is sherry and oak. Taste is bright and grassy with good mouthfeel.  There is a complex mossy undertone that tastes slightly unpleasant.  Finish is long and complex, like sour raisins, and it lingers with bitterness. I can tell it’s a high quality whiskey but the flavor profile is not for me."

ココナッツぽさはあるが、おそらく入ってないのでわりかし好みの味である。

This whisky contains dry fruits, it feels very fruity and so fresh.

This is not Coconuts taste, so it’s my favorite one comparatively."
3.5,No nonsense whiskey. Very similar nose and taste to bourbon. Like a ginger snap cookie
4.5,Spicy.  Smooth.  I really enjoyed this.

4.0,"The nose on a neat pour in a glencairn is soft, warm and welcoming. Unlike a Jameson which is bright and fruity and shouts at you to pay attention, Redbreast 12 doesn’t need to. Apple, dark candied fruit, caramel and oak all wrapped nicely in a malted package is what it presents.

Palate starts off sweet and smooth, and then there is Granny Smith apple for days, mixed with butter and warmed baking spices that remind you of your first apple pie. 

The finish is dry but lingers, which you don’t expect, but sure appreciate it when you’re there.  The malted barley that presented at the nose comes back for an encore now, with the sherry cask and wood notes rounding it out. 

This whiskey begs you to slow down, take your time and enjoy the rich nuanced flavours it has to offer. A really solid representation of what Pot Still Irish can be."

4.5,"You'd be forgiven for thinking this an avec in a blind tasting. A glorious sweet sipper dominated by fruits and nuts. My benchmark for Irish pot whiskey that has yet to be toppled. 

While the 15y edition is also glorious it adds very little to the already complete experience that the 12y provides.

Redbreast are at the forefront of Irish whiskey and they know it, which clearly shows in the price. A bargain this is not, but a coveted glass to pour when you want a delicious punctuation to an evening."

null,Became a favourite at first sip.
4.5,"Neat, no water. Glencairn.

Nose: Mostly oak, some sweetness coming through.

Palate: Sweetness through and through. Warm and full. Strong caramel. Tastes like candy.

Finish: More caramel. Short finish."

3.5,"Neat, no water back needed. 

Nose: easy on the nose but nothing epic that stood out, hint of sweet
Palate: light feel, smooth start to finish. Can definitely pick out the sherry influence in the sweetness toward the end. Good one to keep around, interested to try older ones!

Thanks Jud 🤙🏼"
