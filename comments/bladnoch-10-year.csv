3.75,"Often overlooked, dismissed and underrated, Lowland whiskies are consigned to the shadows. With its massive square bottle, Bladnoch 10 is almost shouting out: 'Look, I'm back!' The nose opens up nicely, combining grainy and floral notes with sour cream, blackberries and fresh citrus. On the palate, the aromatic and semidry arrival gives way to sweet vanilla cream, bitter lemon and grassy hints of coconut. Mild tannins, grapefruit and a touch of roasted bread mark the medium-length finish. A fine summer dram which is far from being a lightweight!

3.5,"Light fruity nose, sweet finish."
3.75,"Butter, malt, citrus, grass and a hint of berries on the nose, palate and medium finish. There's some pepper heat on the palate and finish. 
The empty glass smells of buttered sour dough toast, malt and berries, not for long, but it's glorious while it does."
3.25,Ginger nose. Also alcohol smell. Ginger and oak taste. Not my favorite.

4.25,"Nose - Lightly grassy vanilla, vanilla frosting, lemon yogurt, lemon curd, very floral

Taste - Lightly spicy/warm, grassy vanilla frosting sweet, lemon curd/zest, coconut, glaze on donuts

Finish - Lingering grassy vanilla sweet, gentle warmth, creamy mouthfeel like from a coconut cream, light ginger spice, lemon curd

Score - 88/100

Final Thoughts - This was quite an interesting one. It had a very grassy, floral, vanilla frosting vibe to it throughout which I think would be a good intro to someone who doesn't necessarily like whisky, but loves desserts. I think this might hold up well in a highball as a good intro drink as it's nice & subtle, but flavorful at the same time. I can definitely see how this might be polarizing to some as the grassy aspect is very prominent, but I quite enjoy it. There's this light lemon zest/curd aspect throughout that gets a bit artificial, but I don't mind it too much. I don't think this is something I'd drink everyday, but it's very spring/summery and has nice bright/refreshing notes to it.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - If it was priced around $40 USD"
