4.25,"This was a free drink from the bartender who gave me the two Pappy Van Winkle and the Glenfiddich Winter Storm, and it was a good one, a little normal with some interesting notes. What is great about this dram is that all bottles are single barrel bottles.

Bottled at 45.5%abv.

On the nose was actually something i didn't found before: kiwi and starfruits (in spanish the name of the fruit is ""carambola""), sour aromas, prunes. Banana comes up after a couple minutes, fresh herbal vanilla. 

On the palate, salty, peppery, mango with salt (reminded me of a girl who ate mango with salt in the high school bus) some smoke in the back but mostly salty.

Overall this is a dram that deserves an 85 over 100, i would recommended as something a little different. Cheers!"

3.5,Good flavor. Tasted a bit sweet but not too much.
