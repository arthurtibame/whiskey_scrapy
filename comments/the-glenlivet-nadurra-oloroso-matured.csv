3.0,Reminds me of Christmas fruitcake cherry licorice very fruity great with dessert
3.0,"Defiantly loves water. Sweet and for desert. Nose: Christmas fruit cake. Dry cherries, licorice & apricot. 
Taste: cinnamon, marmalade 
Finish: spicy, warm

This offering reminds me of smells and taste of grandmothers fruitcake. 

Good for a cold day, great substitute for sherry by the fireplace."

4.0,I've tried this one both neat and with a drop of water. I prefer it neat. I noticed notes of raisins on the palate and chocolate on the finish. I was surprised by the lower score.

3.0,"[Whiskey Live paris 2015] Very thick.  Definitely sherried.  Pretty harsh, light smoke.  Felt like I was gnoshing on raspberries and strawberries.  I was left feeling slightly underwhelmed, but It definitely has texture and punch to it.  I would recommend if you're a Glenlivet fan looking for something more interesting."
4.0,"Vanilla, caramel and hint of orange peel on the nose. Notable heat.  The pallet gives way to an increase in sweetness with just a hint of cinnamon. Nice long finish."

null,Excellent dram. Compares nicely to Macallan Cask Strength which is one of my favorites. A spot of water definitely opens it up and brings out some of the alcohol notes along with the Sherry. Not for the faint of heart.

4.0,"First of all, delicious. Huge nutty, sherry nose. Full bodied, rich mouthfeel, very luscious. Plenty of sherry flavors throughout from the lengthy time spent in those barrels, slightly sweet cherry balanced with the tannin from the wood."

4.0,"Tasted at the Iberian Lounge, Hotel Hershey. Quite a liberal pour, easily 3x what it should have been! At cask-strength, it requires a lot of water to balance, but the nose was immense, with rich ambrosial raisin, milk chocolate, warm caramel, some caramelized onions and even earthy mushroom, on a background of freshly turned soil (not peat, but nitrogen). On the palate; thick, hint of soap initially, then sweet oak spices, recognizable signature marzipan and hint of zesty grapefruit rind. Long finish, malty, minty and fairly hot, just enough to remind you to pace yourself. I'm a bit ashamed to admit it, but I believe this NAS Sherry version impressed me almost as much as the original 16. Bravo! Dry glass: sweet, metallic and woody."

4.0,"The nose is rich and smooth with the sherry note right there. To drink you get the oily texture of non-chill filtered varieties, followed by the brief burn of cask stregnth. Then the body hits smooth, creamy, spicy and just a little nutty. The texture stands out more than the flavour but there are pleanty of subtle notes to appreciate. I seem to pick out different flavours every time I try it so while it won't be my everyday choice I will probably keep a bottle around."

4.0,"I opened this last night wit some family over for Memorial Day.  I believe it's a 16 yr old ( didn't specify here).   It's rich and semi-sweet...really a great after dinner drink.  Definately needs a cube of ice to bring out the hazelnut and nutty flavors.  Open it up, let it breathe a bit, and add either ice or water.  Does wonders then.   This was a hit for all around----very much the ""Oban 14"" type where all would love it.  Great to keep around when you have a range of folks coming and wanted something fairly liked by all"

5.0,"Having the 1st dram of this from my bottle and I must say this is amazing! 60.3% ABV, no alcohol burn at all. A mouth full of dark fruits, it reminds me of forest fruit jam, blackberries, raspberries, blueberries. Great sherry flavours with a nice spicy bite to it, I can keep sipping this all night. Cheers my fellow addicts!"

4.25,"Great value again, only 83 Canadian $ and delicious. I'm talking about the cask strenght version, I have the 48% travel retail exclusive as well but I keep that one for guests :p. Very fruity on the nose, a big hit of plums and apricots. It has also a dry and slightly salty quality to it. Very long finish of dark fruits again, my tong is a bit numb because of the ABV. Great dessert dram!"

I sampled this in a “flight” with a few different high end bourbons and scotches, and even my non whiskey obsessed friends were impressed. Good stuff. WAAAY better than and 81... I’d give it a 94"

3.75,"Olfato: pêras cozidas (talvez maçãs vermelhas), ameixas secas, notas frutadas de frutos vermelhos além de bons aromas apimentados e doces. 

Paladar: basicamente as mesmas notas identificadas no olfato, porém entrega um dulçor além do esperado. Boas notas apimentadas e amadeiradas. As tradicionais características do vinho Jerez Oloroso estão presentes, tais como as de oxidação, frutos vermelhos e frutos secos.

Finalização: média para curta.

Impressões gerais: não trata-se de uma bomba de Jerez como inicialmente esperava-se, mas com certeza trata-se de um whisky saboroso. Possui um ABV elevado, o que pode assustar alguns degustadores desavisados, no entanto algumas gotas de água podem acalmar este whisky, auxiliando os paladares menos acostumados com graduações alcoólicas mais altas."

Avent 2019 - 20/24.
Nom de dieu que ce whisky est bon, pratiquement aussi bon que le film que je m'apprête à écouter, The Matrix. Je me sens projeter dans un autre univers et je ne suis pas capable de faire la différence entre le monde réel et le monde des rêves. Une propulsion de fruits mûre me jette littéralement sur le dos. C'est puissant, c'est corsé, c'est magnifique. J'adore!"
