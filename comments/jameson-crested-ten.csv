5.0,"Why oh why is this not available in the US !?!?  I have to bring back bottles of this whenever I travel abroad and savor every bit of it, waiting anxiously for my next trip when my reserve runs out. Vastly superior to the stock Jameson at virtually the same price (less cost of plane tickets). I grab a bottle as soon as my plane lands and this is my everyday nightcap until I have to go home again."

2.0,"Mar 2017
A snowy St. Paddy's Day and I tasted this while watching United vs Brighton in the FA cup. I was expecting much more from a whiskey rated highly here. It is hot and peppery but a tiny step above a regular Jameson. Rating it a 2.5."
