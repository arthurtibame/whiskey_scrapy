4.5,"Now here is the best from the distillery in Bayswater. A nose to die for - amplified rich honey-glazed sultanas and dried apricots. Continues with such an oily palate not dissimilar to Redbreast Cask Strength. Much more refined, bold intense appley pear palate than its standard strength bottling. And the finish? Long. Drawn out. Heart warming ripe banana and toffee apple finish. For a Peat-lover/non-Speyside drinker to say this... kudos to you, Bakery Hill."
3.75,It was interesting chatting to David who got into whiskey nearly a couple of decades ago. He got his 1000 litre still custom made many years ago. They can't keep up with demand so they are looking to upgrade to both larger equipment and larger premise closer to the city in Kensington in ~ years time. They used to supply Europe but now have more than enough demand from Aussie alone. Anyhow this dram was impressive for 60%. Didn't need any water at all but a few drops opened it up further. Similar to the 46% but deeper concentration of flavor and less of the green apple more of malt.
4.0,Notes just say yes!
