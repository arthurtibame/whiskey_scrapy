4.0,"Golden honey color in the glass. Honey, pear, sweet cut grass and a hint of vanilla on the nose. Ginger, pear and vanilla. A touch of cinnamon hard candy on the tongue. Finishes with a nice warming feel and a light honey taste. A easy drinking whiskey. Has the elements of Canadian, Irish and bourbon all rolled into one nice dram. And at $13 a bottle a total steal."

4.0,"A little sweet on the nose, grassy and a slightly floral taste.  A little alcohol kick, but still easy to drink.  Not overly sophisticated,  but a nice sipper to be sure."

3.0,"Light and corny like an episode of Gilligan's Isle. Sweet and simple, with somewhat more character than what you get from industrial-level distilleries' entry level products. Real crowd pleaser. Great at parties, but not necessarily something I'd keep on stock at the ole home bar."
4.0,"80 proof entry level spirit.  Sits comfortably between the sweetness of Canadian Whiskey and high octane, powerful bourbons.  A sipping spirit for sure.  Not overtly nuanced on either end of the spectrum.  Approachable, enjoyable and appropriate for amateurs and enthusiasts alike."
