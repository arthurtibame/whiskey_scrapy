3.0,"Caramel and dried fruits on the nose. Well rounded pepper, oak, cereal and brine on the pallette, with light smoke and notes of lemonleaves and honey as it goes along. Missing the sherry?"

3.0,"Pepper and peat lead the way in this lightly smoky, lightly salty 10 year version. Butterscotch and dried fruit flavours are concluded by lemony acidity and a teaspoon of honey. Classic Highland Park character but entry-level quality."
