3.0,"Another day another closed distillery. A grain one this time Garnheath. I couldn't even find a single entry for the distillery on this site so must be rare.  It's also rare that its older than me. Rarity aside I wouldn't say it's a great drop. Well balanced but sweet cherry heavy, vanilla etc. solid 3 for a slice of history."
