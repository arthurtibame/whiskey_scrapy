3.5,"Norway's first-ever peated whisky was matured in 40 l seasoned Oloroso casks for 3 years, bottled at 47% ABV and given a craft presentation. Not overtly young, the nose starts off with chimney soot, dried fruits and fenalår. Hints of rosemary, stockfish and sweet cherries add some complexity. Peat smoke, orange zest and loads of pepper drive the aromatic and herbal-fresh taste of this youngster. With a salty edge of licorice and fading wood smoke, the finish dissolves into raspberry sweetness. At 3 years of age, this is a remarkably solid dram from Myken.
