4.0,"For a reasonably priced scotch (Tesco £30 1lt) this has a nice taste, I found the standard Tamunvulin a little harsh but this sherry cask edition is a delight to drink."

3.75,"Lots of raisins, some salty sea, and sherry perfume on the nose. Sweet caramel and vanilla on the palate with a wisp of smoke that gives way to ginger and orange peel as a finish. 

A smooth dram with little nooks and crannies of flavors to go exploring in. A decent budget whiskey, if also a bit watery. I would buy it again as a daily dram. 

On second sip, there’s more vanilla, caramel, and chocolate smells and flavors come through and the sherry perfume goes away."
