4.25,"Bottled cask strength at 115°, this straight bourbon is three years old. The color is a rich deep copper and you would have a hard time knowing it was less than 6 years old by color, taste, or aroma. It jumps out of the glass with an easiness that belies its high proof. Immediate notes of vanilla, caramel, light rye spice, corn syrup, and oak on the nose. Taste is fig, cereal, toasted corn and oak. Finish is pleasantly warm ,though not as hot as I’d expect from the proof, and has some oak tannin I didn’t expect either.  This is one I’ll be seeking out again. My bottle is also hand-signed by Master Distiller Brent Goodin."
