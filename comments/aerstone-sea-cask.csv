3.75,It's a bit too straightforward for me but it's decent all the same. It does say 'smooth and easy' so I'm not surprised.

3.5,"Very Briney, honey notes, slight peat"
2.5,"Simple.  Vanilla/Floral.  Not tasting the brine/salt I would expect from the name.  Very smooth though.  One of the cheapest single malts I've bought, may be a better value/taste than many blends around the same price range."

3.75,"A little peat, iodine and brine on the nose initially, after a few minutes in the glass some butter and play dough (a little weird) appear, smooth entry on the palate, a little buttery with some indeterminant seaside flavors, finish is medium length, warming and pleasant."

3.5,Lovely easy drinking dram salt on the nose and vanilla and caramel to taste.
3.25,"Very friendly, fruity, and vanilla in the nose. Slight briney, almost makes me think of an unmalted barley quality but it’s MUCH more rounded and not as “funky”. Taste is salty and Smokey but only slightly. Caramel and light fruit notes on the palette. Finish is a bit oily and lingers a bit turning back into that malty note."
3.0,quite good
