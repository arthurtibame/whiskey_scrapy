4.0,"Beautiful, sweet and spicy, has a kick in the mouth, but smooth on the throat. Love this adventurous young whisky"
3.0,"Exclusive Summerton Virtual Whisky Festival sample.  A total of 8 barrels will be released following the festival a 1,948 bottle run.

This is a whisky that’s far removed from a typical Scotch whisky.  The influence of the ex-bourbon cask is extremely prevalent.

The nose is bready and woody.  Upfront it’s very full bodied for such a young whisky, extremely fruity and with sweet vanilla.  There’s a good amount of pepper on the finish, but it mostly leaves you with a sweet and honeyed aftertaste.  

It’s a nice dram and it bodes well for some future more aged releases."
