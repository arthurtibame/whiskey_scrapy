3.0,"A serviceable whisky, and a good choice so long as you approach it with expectations tempered. The sherry influence is obvious, but fruity notes are fairly muted here. Things are instead pretty woodsy, with notes of caramel and vanilla. The body is a little flat, yet the finish is wonderfully smooth. It's good... I'm just not a fan of one-dimensional whiskies."

4.0,"I had a few drams of this lovely whisky at a good friend’s the other night. I mention this because perhaps it was the conversation and company that influenced my opinion of the whisky. On the whole, I’m not much on Glenfiddich. Always a decent single malt, but never anything that makes me want to go back for seconds. However, I truly loved this sherry cask edition. It was very smooth, with the oak spice easy on the palate, while the vanilla swirled around in my mouth like warm vanilla ice cream, with a great, lingering finish. I score it a solid 4 and have added it to my wish list."
4.0,Very nice on the nose and palate. Kind of sweet finish. No burn and very little peat.

3.0,"Today we conclude the Glenfiddich week, with something that might well be the weakest expression of them all so far. On the nose there is some cherry and citrus, and a lot of oak. That oak is the one dominant note in the entire composition. On the taste it is combined with some malty sweetness and vanilla, and it has a short stay on the aftertaste. Rather disappointing. Not quite 2 star level bad, but for my taste even worse than Project XX. So yeah, conclusion, if you want a good Glenfiddich, stick with 15 or 18, unless you want a bit more bitter, then the IPA will serve you well. Stay away from XX and this one...just not bloody worth it."

4.5,"Wow. Truly unique, very oily and sweet. The aroma is delightful, with an extremely smooth and honey based taste, with underscores a vanilla and maple, to the point it's almost got an aged rum component instead of Scotch. I have no idea why this is rated so low below 90. Highly recommend, for an evening finisher with sweet aftertaste like a dessert."
