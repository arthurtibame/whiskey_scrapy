4.5,Sehr fein! Etwas rauchig aber trotzdem weich
3.5,"I was very much looking fwd to the Ardbeg special tasting. Sadly they took my two least favorite Ardbegs and a special one and just did CS versions. Spoiler alert the 3rd was this year's pinot noir.

Now i wasnt to sure if it had been released before and it had in Japan back in 2003. I saw one place selling this for $1000 USD..crazy! Sadly very much wasted on me..I walked out early. Now I did try this after the Glendronach 25 Master Vintage and 24 Grandeur so perhaps it would have been better prior. Anyhow...disappointed.."
