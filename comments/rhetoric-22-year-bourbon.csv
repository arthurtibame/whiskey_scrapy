5.0,"Paid $149, really well balanced, has a good sweetness to it and isn't overly oaky given the age"

4.0,"I would say 4.5.  Better than I expected given the reviews for the 20 & 21 yr.  Awesomely balanced, there's a lot of oak but for me it works quite well.  I found mine for $109, and it's amazing at that price."

5.0,"What a nice bourbon to open up a post-work, day-drinking session.  When working the graveyard shift you have to adjust your Happy Hour to a more appropriate time:  9-11am.  Sadly, no bars around my town understand that, so I have to take matters into my own hands.  A big thanks to Ryan for saving me a sample of this elusive whiskey.

This is the third Orphan Barrel whiskey I've had the pleasure of trying and I've got say right up front- they were all good, but this one is damn fine.  It's spent a measly 22 years in the oak (measly by Scotch standards, lol).  It's a deep copper color and smells heavily of oak and vanilla.

On the tongue, it's quite oily and very woodsy.  The rye is really tamed well by the barrel notes and the long rest has smoothed this thing out wonderfully.  The flavor isn't muted at all it's just heavy oak, vanilla and rye.  Typical rye whiskey, just very velvety and delicious.  The finish is long, warm and a bit spicy.  

I'm not a big bourbon guy, especially rye whiskey, but I feel like this one is well worth the hefty price tag.  If you buy one, though, don't put it away in your closet- drink it.  Fantastic juice.  4.5 stars.  Cheers, my friends"

5.0,"Mmmmm.  Fruity aroma.  I was expecting a strong woody taste, but it wasn't there.  It seemed to have a little bit of a fruitiness note.  Warm, smooth (but not Sinatra Select smooth).  I really enjoyed it.  One of the better whiskeys I've tasted."

null,"Good nose. Strong caramel, orchard fruit, vanilla. Light on the front end, but more flavor kicks in on the back end. Overall, still a bit light. Leather, cinnamon, wood, a hint of cola. 11/27/17"

4.0,"Little harsh on the tip, but damn the body and back-end was grand. Even better with a drop of water - opened up into a more floral taste. Now I’m trying to justify spending $179 on a bottle."

4.25,"The nose features a nice balance of fresh biscuits and toast, along with pleasing amounts of vanilla. The palate coats the mouth with vanilla and oak, with baking spices and pepper backing it up. The finish is medium long with fading vanilla, cinnamon and oak. Deliciously simple."
3.5,"Sweet piña colada on the nose, palate sweet start then very dry bitter barrel, finish is unremarkable till 15-20 seconds later till a lingering sweet vanilla, cocoa butter and coconut tanning lotion."
