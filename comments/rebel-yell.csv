Taste: Honey and caramel. Small hints of exotic fruits, like nectarine for example. Very smooth and simple.

Finish: Smoothness continues. Warming, sweet and fruity with oak.

Balance: Mellow and sweet dram. Nothing special but a good choice, if you have a small budget."

2.0,"Rough, sweet and young. This is an incredibly inexpensive whiskey though, and I find it better to cook with than to drink. I marinate and roast a chicken in this and it helps to produce a juicy, flavorful bird. Oven roast your bird with this, onions, garlic, sea salt and a dash of crushed red pepper."

3.0,"Not great or even good, but acceptable: surprisingly smooth for a bottom-shelf whiskey, but the flipside of that is that it's also damn near tasteless.  Light in colour, light in nose, almost non-existent in the mouth. Flavours are solvent, corn oil, corn syrup, honey, green apple, peanut butter--all light and indistinct. Just a hint of wood on the taste and finish. faint vanilla, even fainter cherry. Sweet. Something for a flask or a bonfire on a hot, cheap summer evening."

It's kind of rye - like until the finish.  I'm not getting any of the fruitiness that others find.  It's a taste world of grain.  Grain is ok."

1.0,"Not sure why Distiller gives this an 84. Out of the bottle, the nose is dominated by acetone (not just the typical alcohol nose, but acetone - nail polish remover). After sitting for awhile, the nose transitions to barnyard, with acetone in the background. If you couldn't tell, I didn't like the nose.  On the palate, young corn sweetness and dough - not much if any barrel. This is followed by the characteristic tingle of wheaters, and a short-but-smooth finish. Whereas I love to nose Maker's Mark, but don't like drinking it, I'd avoid nosing this one but pick it for drinking over MM. Simple, one-dimensional sweet, but no off notes while drinking... would probably mix OK, where floral/apple flavors might emerge. Glad I tried it, but won't buy again unless more flavor (and less acetone/barnyard) develop in the open bottle."

(; all in all I would advise rebel yell for an introductory bourbon, not too much spice and just enough kick give a light bourbon feel. It fits the budget well for being under 20 dollars here in WA state. I drink my whiskey neat and my girlfriend said it mixes well with coke or coke cherry; sorry cannot recall. Either way if you love bourbon give this a go. Not as spicy or full as some may like, but hey sometimes its about sipping and appreciating the moment. (:"

3.0,"Medium pale amber in the glass, a little lighter in color than most bourbons. Thin legs on the side of the glass. 

Nose:  alcohol, vanilla, peaches, and something vaguely sour that I cannot place. Sweet corn, too. 
Palate:  sweet and lightly nutty. Hotter than one would expect at 40% ABV. Sweetness carries through mid-palate, along with a little wood. 
Finish:  medium length, hot and slightly bitter. 

Conclusion:  drinkable, but not great. Perhaps a good mixer or base for an old fashioned. A “C” player. 3 stars owing to its affordability."

It enters with a nice sweetness. Light vanilla with a touch of straw and oak. Little to no burn on the finish with just a very small amount of vanilla and mint lingering. Ice kills what little complexity this one has. I described Four Roses Yellow Label as ""light without being weak"". Unfortunately the Rebel Yell is both Light AND Weak. With a name like Rebel Yell you would expect some bite or burn. Some harshness and character. I really feel this one is WAAAAAY under proofed. I'd love to see it at 86-90. That would definitely help it. I did like what it offered, however. A good, light simple sipper. Would be a good summertime day drinker. However, if I'm in the mood for a light 80 proof sipper, I feel that the 4Roses is a far superior choice. I can also catch it on sale for around the same price as the RY. 3 stars from me."

Nose: The nose hits me as I raise the lid off my glen with a fist of car exhaust and nail polish to my nasal cavity, only to apologize with a kiss of honey, red apple, and oak wood shavings after a few minutes.

Taste: The first taste has the same effect as the first smell - more of a punch than a firm handshake. After a couple minutes though it opens up and is more friendly. The palate is welcoming with sweet honey, cherry, and maybe a green grape and Red Vine candy note that flows into the finish.

Finish: The finish is bizarre and took me a while to pin down, but there is a tingling mouthfeel and a kiwi aftertaste following the Red Vine note.

Thoughts: This is a strange bourbon. It isn't bad! But it isn't something that I expected or maybe want again for a little while either. I really liked the complexity, but I didn't care for the turn off at the get go, but appreciated that it warmed up to me after a bit. Luxco Inc., you've put me in a hard place - do I dislike it, or am I a huge fan!? I'm not sure. Here's to another dram to find out! Sláinte!"

3.0,"The Rebel Yell brand has been around since 1849 and used to be distilled out of the old Stitzel-Weller distillery before that closed in 1990's. Rebel Yell was acquired by Luxco and has undergone a label redesign along with a push to change it's bottom shelf status.
Many have heard that this is the whiskey that inspired Billy Idol's album and song by the same name. That is quite true, however, the real story behind that inspiration has little to do with what's actually inside the bottle. While at a party with Rolling Stones, he noticed they had a bottle of whiskey with a confederate calvary officer on it, that was the label design of Rebel Yell at that time. Ironically, the Rolling Stones told him it was a bottle of Tennessee southern sourmash even though all the labels have always clearly stated ""Kentucky.""
While Luxco never officially discloses the information, it is widely known that Rebel Yell is sourced from Heaven Hill. This is a wheated bourbon using the same mashbill as Old Fitzgerald: 68% corn, 20% wheat, 12% malted barley.
On the nose there's lots of ethanol, popcorn butter, honey, and saw dust at the very end. On the palate there's simple syrup sweetness, black pepper spice, golden raisins, and some oak. Finish is quick with more black pepper and slight bitterness.
While not terrible, Rebel Yell is very simple and unremarkable in every way. The move to a higher price point is bewildering as well considering Ezra Brooks, which is also in Luxco's portfolio, is considerably better and priced lower."

Palate has some oak,raw cinnamon spice and lite vanilla with minimal heat. Again its not bold but pleasant nonetheless. Finish is short to medium with dry oak and cinnamon lingering. There is basically no burn. I think the rough edges typical of this price point have been sanded away by the wheat influence. Its not complex at all but fairly balanced for the $12 I paid. As others have said its an easy drinker and no need for ice or water. Not much here for the experienced cask strength pro but good for beginners and nice change of pace for the rest. For the money its a good buy and in my area low cost wheaters are hard to come by 80/100 good low cost daily driver"

2.75,Slightly sweet oakiness. Not very complex flavor profile. Not bad for a 12 dollar bottle
3.5,"Rebel Yell is a very decent cheap wheated whiskey. It doesn't do anything special and it's thin on flavor, taste, depth, etc. However, imo at a readily available sub $15 price point for a 750ml bottle wheated whiskey it's not an inherently bad bourbon it's just a very basic wheated bourbon. I feel that it's an under appreciated bottle as I'm not sure what some people are expecting from a bottle shelf bourbon, beyond a hang over if you over imbibe, that Rebel Yell doesn't provide. I will note that in the past year of so I've gotten some bottles that had that overwhelming 'peanut' funk usually attributed to Beam products so if you enjoy that and haven't tried the Reb in awhile perhaps you'd enjoy another taste."

This is probably the best bourbon I've had for under 20 dollars. (15 to be exact). I'd drink it anytime for the price."

I find it a challenge to find a drinkable whiskey at a rock bottom price (under $20). This is one of 3 in that category for me. This is the best sipper, Evan Williams black best with coke, and Jim Beam Extra aged best versatile. If you got questions about my 20-30 picks let me know..."

4.0,"Nose... Wheat, wheat, and more wheat. Haven't had the slightest sip, but wow. Following is butterscotch, dried apples, raisins and vanilla. 

Appearance... Faint for sure. Dark gold to light amber...

Taste... Abundant wheat, followed by apricot, faint grass, butterscotch, nuts, and finally vanilla to complete the sundae..

Overall... This is one heck of a sipper that's for sure. I was about to pick up this 1.75L for $23.00 and I cannot be more pleased about the value. Easy drinking, simply smooth and if tested or tasted blindly against other more expensive wheaters, I wouldn't be surprised if this sipper took home gold."
