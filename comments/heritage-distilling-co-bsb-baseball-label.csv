2.0,"Good as flavored whiskies go, brown sugar dominates everything, of course. Wish it were a little stronger."

5.0,"Perfect for someone who is looking for a way to get into brown spirits. For me I like to substitute it into cocktails in place of a traditional bourbon. Makes an amazing Old Fashioned with great depth of flavor, and you can skip adding the sugar cube. Also makes an amazing mint julep. Because it has only natural ingredients you don't get the fake notes of other ""flavored"" whiskeys. No fake sugar notes either - just pure, real taste. The perfect addition to BBQ sauce, as well. My wife thanked me for introducing BSB to her - now she can enjoy a glass of whiskey with me!"
1.0,VERY sweet. It might be good for a cocktail but not straight up.

3.0,"BSB has sat in my collection for a year and this my first time tasting. This was a gift from the wife. The nose is all brown sugar, sweet. The taste is cinnamon and brown sugar. Almost like fireball but much sweeter. The finish is brown sugar. It’s literally tastes like fireball with a whole bunch of brown sugar mixed in. This would probably be good for cocktails, but for me not by itself. I’m giving it 2.5-3."

5.0,I love it to sip on or to mix. Made a plum lemon grass whiskey sour with it! delightful!
2.0,Good for mixing sweet cocktails but not a sipping bourbon. Brown sugar taste is cloying and sticks around a bit too long pushing out other flavors.
