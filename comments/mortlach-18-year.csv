4.0,"They say you love or hate the Mortlach flavour profile. After sampling this then a few other drams and then this again to make up my mind I'm definitely in the former camp. It's a really interesting taste, a spicy, meaty, rubbery slightly metallic sherried profile that balances out quite nicely. Reading that back after typing it I think that sounds terrible but it isn't. Now this isn't cheap just shy of $140USD here (which is weirdly a lot cheaper than the UK where it's from where it's  $200USD) for only a 500ml bottle. I'd love to buy a whole bottle and see how this develops over time. The only criticism is a bit like the compass box range the slight bitter metallic  (or in the CB case turpentine) after taste lingers. It's an 18 year and it is also very unique and so for those reasons despite the price I'm sticking to a solid 4 overall rating. If it wasn't for the price it'd definately be a higher rating. Even an hour later I'm still thinking about it's taste. I have a (entire time in sherry barrel) 41 year bottle from this distillery saved for a special occasion so it's going to be very interesting to see how that one turns out."

4.75,"This is Halloween/Thanksgiving in a bottle. If Plymouth gin had a baby with Macallan 18, this would be that beautiful creation.

The age comes through through the tannins and oaky mouthfeel, which mostly avoids smokiness.
The caramel and vanilla meld with the sherry nuttiness, and finish smooth."
4.5,"Smooth taste, very suitable for business dinner, no disappointed"

4.75,Mortlach 18 Christmas cake light a lot of alcohol aftertaste compared to how smooth glenmorangie signet is but what a great comparison tasting at gatwick duty free ended up with glenmorangie tayne similar profile but half the price and one litre if I could ignore the prices I would get this in a heart beat but maybe glenmorangie signet first
