5.0,"Rich and sweet, there are a lot of spices from this lovely port cask matured whiskey. Floral on the nose with citrus elements, it's complex and a delight to drink."

5.0,"Limeburners was the revelation of last week’s Whisky Live NY for me. This Western Australian whisky isn’t available in the US yet, but founder Cameron Syme was at the show to pour three bottles: a sherry cask, a peated whisky and a cask strength “port cask.” Each was a knockout: richly flavored, well integrated, and very smooth. Here’s what I can remember from my conversation with Syme: the peat is local to the distillery and one reason why he chose its location; the “port” casks are actually barrels from an Australian fortified wine; er, that’s it. I don’t know the age of these and nor can I be sure that my mental five stars for each one wasn’t unduly influenced by an excess of fun and fine whisky. I do know that you should try them if you get the chance, either by snapping up samples still available from Master of Malt or persuading the Astor Spirits buyer who was tasting alongside me that it’s only fair dinkum to get some in this arvo. Good onya, Cameron."
