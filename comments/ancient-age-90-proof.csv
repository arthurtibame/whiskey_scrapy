2.75,"Nose- Very sweet corn notes with a bit of caramel 
Body- Full bodied with sweet corn, vanilla, nutmeg and finally dark chocolate. 
Finish- Bitter cocoa with a hint of fresh green grass and mint 

Ok straight. This is a very good whiskey for a sweeter old fashioned."

2.0,Flavor runs away fast but enough initially to make it a solid pour. Your standard sweetness with a hint of spice. Very young but the 90 proof bump provides that extra flavor while still hiding the alcohol burn. It’s the same price as the standard Ancient Age so kind of a no brainer grabbing this one.

2.75,"90 proof and “aged at least 36 months”.  I’ve had a few of these bottles over the years, and I’m sure I’ll have more in the future.  I thought I’d put a review up for it on this app.  

N:  Cornbread, acetone, brown sugar, anise, lemon, a bit of caramel trying to hide.

P:  Buttered corn, butterscotch, oily peanuts, a bit of spearmint.

F:  Toasted oak, baking spices, licorice.

Fairly similiar, but not totally identical, to the Ancient Ancient Age 10 Star (AAA 10 Star).  This doesn’t have much going on with it either.  It’s pretty strong with the corn notes.   Although, it’s relatively decent value when you consider it’s 90 proof and was $9 or $10 a bottle.  I’ve only seen this 90 proof version in Kentucky.  The 80 proof version is available pretty much everywhere.  I like to use this as one of my “beater whiskeys”.  One that I don’t have to think or care about when out hiking, fishing, on horse back, or whatever. I wouldn’t expect many folks to drink this neat, nor would I necessarily recommend it - except for it’s value."
