4.25,"Midleton Academy Bottle is a Single Pot Still Irish Whiskey and is an exclusive bottling of Midleton for the Irish Whiskey Academy. It is matured in four American ex-bourbon barrels (two first fill and two second fill) and for some time in an ex-sherry cask. It is a non-age statement whiskey.

Am lucky enough to have  both the 1st and 2nd editions of this whiskey.
