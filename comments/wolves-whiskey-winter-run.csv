3.0,Def pulls the hops flavor. I was hoping it wouldn’t be a strong hop flavor.
4.5,"Buddy shared this amazingness. Beautiful bottle. The detail of the bottle is beyond amazing. 

N(4):chocolate peanut. Oak. Tobacco. Dark berries. Musty scotch. 
P(5): soda feel right away. So cool. Tiny rye spice but no bitterness. Tobacco dryness and flavor. So unique. Flavors I can’t pull out. Hint of sweetness. 
F(4.25): hug. Oak on the back end and some time of dried berries on the back end. Would like it to be more bold."
