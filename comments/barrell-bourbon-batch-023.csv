4.25,"Vanilla, sweet but just enough burn. 👍🏻"
4.0,"It's all there in the nose. Vanilla, caramel, dry oak, butterscotch and spice. 
Hints of eucalyptus and cedar.
soft mouthfeel, but tons of heat on the back end.
Plenty of chocolate and vanilla left on the finish, and the heat comes from both the alcohol and the barrel.
Very long finish, dominated mostly by the barrel.
Super complex and really hot.  VERY dry finish.  Hints of clove stick around"

4.5,"Batch 023 is a hybrid of Batches 014 & 018 as I taste 014 and 023 side-by-side tonight. 023 has the quintessential Bourbon notes of 014 minus the vitamin note, with a nice dose of spice reminiscent of 018, but without the overt desert-like cinnamon bomb profile that made 018 notable. Overall, I prefer 023 narrowly over 014, and much more over 018, with Batch 017 in a photo finish with 023. Barrell is a premium Bourbon at a premium price, but it’s just so damn good. I’ll take one Barrell product over 2 mid-priced Bourbons anytime."
4.0,"Enjoying the heck out of this. Aroma is heavy, bold and complex with nicely layered sweet and rustic notes; Palate is a wacky combo of elegant dessert and more rustic profiles that work very well together in a way that’s making me gravitate to this bottle a tad more than everything else on my shelf; Finish bundles the best and sends you home feeling wonderful."
4.75,"Those who have followed me for a while will know I am a certified Barrell groupie! I have been a fan of theirs since the very early batches and love the vast majority of what they put out! If I am honest the more recent Bourbon batches have been underwhelming (15-19) but this trend ended with the fantastic Batch 21. That batch was phenomenal and the Batch 23 had similar components (10, 12 and 15 yr old Dickel, Barton and MGP blend) so I had to pick it up as well! Below are my notes after comparing both side by side... Let's dive in:

Barrell Batch 21:

It enters so viscous and mouthcoating. A burst of fresh berries (raspberries predominantly) leads the palate with buttered cornbread. Some tart cherries and and a hint of cocoa. Black pepper in the background throughout leading to toasted oak, leather and tobacco. Lovely well aged notes shine on the long finish. 

Barrell Batch 23:

This also features a rich and viscous entry! Cinnamon baked apples, caramel and black pepper lead. Tobacco, orange peel, clove and toasted oak join the party on the mid palate. The finish is very long with cinnamon, cherry and oak. Airy but yet very rich. Sweet but with lovely spice. Robust but so easy to sip!

Both are superior Bourbons, however, Batch 23 has a bit more complexity and spice that edges it for me! 

Cheers All!"

3.5,"Strong cacao nibs on the nose, I also get brown sugar, birthday cake, vanilla, and slight mint. It's nice. On the palate, a bit astringent, sweet, more cacao nibs and mint, a hint of pumpkin pie. Spicy but the heat is mild. Another solid offering from BCS. 4/7/2020"
