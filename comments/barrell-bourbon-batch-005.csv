4.0,"Bought in Spring Hill, TN for $85.  I'm not crazy about the price but this is a delicious Bourbon.  It reminds me of BTAC Stagg and I can actually walk in and pick this up off the shelf.  I'll keep a bottle on my top shelf for special occasions."
4.0,"Sweet, rich maple, followed by spicy heat. I should have asked for an ice cube, but this is good stuff. $85/bottle? Only when it's on the company..."

5.0,Washes of rich maple and biscuit with a warm char and a rich chew. Excellent price point for a batch that should age well.

2.0,"The nose makes promises of a decent, stereotypical caramelly-vanilla bourbon but the finish on this tastes like dirty, moist paper. The proof tries to cover it up, but it's not fooling anyone."

4.0,"Great nose, this takes me back. To what, I'm not sure. But it definitely takes me back. Nuts, fruit, and dough on the nose. It's like a boozy peanut butter and jelly sandwich. An earthy, truffle note as well. On the palate, prickly spice up front, then the nose carries over - honey roasted peanuts, tart fruit, mushrooms. This must be Dickel. Nice, cascading warmth going down. Cacao nibs remain, and this lingers for a while. It feels thick and oily, quite viscous, like swallowing peanut butter. I'm not saying this is an easy sipper by any means, but it's way smoother than you'd expect for the proof. Another winner in the Barrell line. 8/6/18"
3.0,Definitely taste the high alcohol content. I usually don’t mind but it is prevalent. A little more flavor would be a more balanced bourbon. It is good but not as good as I expected.
