2.25,Sickly sweet. Could be worse.
4.25,"Highland Mist is pale gold, clear, & has typical alcohol legs. The aroma is of earthy, mellow peat w/grain alcohol. The taste is of some bees' wax, peat, & cereal grains, and the body is low medium. Highland Mist finishes medium quick. RJT"
2.25,"If you like mixed Scotch drinks, this is about the cheapest you will find. Nothing to sip about, but it's a decent mixer if you have a very limited cocktail budget."
2.0,"Appearance: The color I found in this blended scotch was clover honey light gold.

Nose: On the nose I found more than I was expecting! There were notes of honey, light peat and smoke, ripe fruit like peaches and banana Laffy Taffy, as well as pine, all with a floral undertone.

Taste: There was a very thin palate, with not much there. The notes I found though, were good - salty brine, pear, watered down honey syrup, and cinnamon covered apples.

Finish: After the swallow there was a bite at first. The finish was medium length and fades into a honey aftertaste.

Thoughts: For a bottom shelf option, I was impressed. From the labeling and all, I was expecting something a lot lower caliber, but this is not terrible! Now, there are of course better options out there, but for a cheap scotch, I would recommend it! Well done and thanks friends! Sláinte!"
