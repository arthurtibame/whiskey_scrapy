4.0,Tasty. Soft finish. Hints of licorice.
3.5,"certainly interesting, easy drinking given the proof. tastes kind of like they dumped a bunch of port in, a lot of sweetness. spicy notes from the rye but drowned by sweet wine flavor on both ends"
null,I have a private cask selection finished in Cabernet Sauvignon barrels.  The wine pretty much dominates the nose and palate.  Not my personal cup of tea.
