4.25,"I believe this is my first French whiskey and I'm impressed. Drank it straight and found it well balanced, smooth and without a hint of roughness or burn and then looked and saw it was 55.5%. That means nothing without flavor and complexity however and in this respect the Warenghem distillery have done a good job on this one. I think it's soley ex-olorosso cask. Loads of orange, vanilla, and something sweet I couldn't put my finger on until I looked other notes up - strawberry. Leaving it sit further really brings it together. It is very much on the upper limits of my tolerance for sweetness however and has a slight candied aftertaste so I don't know if I could drink a large amount. 4 for overall enjoy-ability and 4.25 for craftsmanship."
