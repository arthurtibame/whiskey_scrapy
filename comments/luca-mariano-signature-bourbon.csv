4.5,"Really interesting and tasty, with some unique notes that I believe comes from the smoked cherry wood they use during the finishing process. This was fun to sip and try to pull apart all the flavors. Great stuff. 

Nose - shiny and metallic, sour cherries, honeysuckle, vanilla, apricots 
Taste - silky mouthfeel, sharp cherries, mild tartness, hints of smoldering wood, slight bitter tannins, a rounded sweetness that’s hard to place but really enjoyable 
Finish - the smoked cherry flavor and mild sweetness lingers for a long time, strong burn that sticks with you"
