1.0,"Horrible smell, horrible taste.  Cheap."
1.75,Nose is daw dust and oak. Mouth feel is very thin. Tastes is very young bourbon with a bit of corn sweetness and some fresh cut wood. Drying alcohol burn and short finish.

1.0,"Very sweet on the nose. Can’t pick out many flavors though.

Sipping, the first flavor that hits me is cinnamon. A little bit of apple in there.

Essentially just fireball. Too sweet with lots of cinamon. Not my favorite by any standard.

Bought this because it apparently won some awards in past years but I don’t quite see how. Theres better bourbons for the price."

2.0,OK...but has a slight cardboard taste.
0.25,"Not so much bad as nothing there. Nose of ethanol and little else. Tastes hot at first, with the slightest weird vegetal flavor. Finishes with slight bitterness. It brags of being smooth...not hard to do when there's nothing there."
0.5,"Worst bourbon ever tasted. Very young, no flavor but very hot"

1.0,"Not sure how many ways you can say terrible, but this is god awful terrible. Not even worth the $11 a fifth it costs. $2 would be too much. Tastes like old shoes with a hint of paint thinner."

3.0,New Favorite Mixing Whisky.  Smooth and plays well with Vermouth and mixers.
1.0,"Rotgut whiskey. I will never trust a recommendation from any employee of Total Wine again. There are much, much better options in the same price range, such as Evan Williams White label, Heaven Hill Bottled in Bond, or Ancient Ancient Age.  Hayes Parker is pure dreck."

2.0,"Sugar sweet, but very strong nasal and front of mouth sting"
0.25,"Rough, young whiskey. Green apple—almost cider-like—and cinnamon aroma. Tastes of green apples and cinnamon, like apple pie. Overall, gross."
0.75,"Nose- Young grain moonshine notes.
Body- Unpleasant syrupy sweet notes, fresh grass, and lemon zest that is like a thick Irish whiskey rather than a bourbon. 
Finish- The fresh cut grass and a bit of raw peanut come through on the end making the finish more pleasant than the body. 

Terreseesntia claims that they can make a whiskey aged mere months taste like one aged several years. I claim bullshit."
null,"The worst bourbon I've ever tasted. Not worth a nickel, much less the $12 I paid for it. I'm honestly disturbed I drank it."

1.0,"I love good bourbon and South Carolina, but this is not good bourbon. It pains me to give a bad review from a bourbon from my great state of South Carolina but I must. This is not good if you plan on drinking on ice or neat. You are buying a bourbon to enjoy so buy one that you will enjoy. Sorry, but it is the truth."
