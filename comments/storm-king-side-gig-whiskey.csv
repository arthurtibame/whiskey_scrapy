3.5,"This experimental whiskey from Storm King Distilling Co. is an orange copper color, with thick viscous legs sticking to the glass walls.

The sweet nose is very nice with notes of heavy butterscotch, oatmeal cookie, German chocolate cake, caramel apple, vanilla, and watermelon.

The palate has a watery mouthfeel and is very fruity with notes of green apple, dark grapes, peach, buttery cinnamon French toast, tangy Cutie orange and lemon.

The finish is lingering with a taste like sweet yogurt raisins. Cheers!"
