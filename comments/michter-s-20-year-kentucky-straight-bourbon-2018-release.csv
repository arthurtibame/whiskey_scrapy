5.0,"Might be the best bourbon I've ever tasted.  The color was deep, unlike any I've ever seen.  The nose had a certain sweetness to it.  The taste was like an infinite amount of all the best parts of the Bible duking it out for supremacy in my mouth all at one time."

5.0,"One of my local bar's that's better known for craft cocktails decided to do a breakeven bottle and boy did they pick a great one! At 22/oz it was an absolute no brainer to grab a pour! To my surprise when I got there I realized it was the 2018 release versus what I expected to be the 2019 release. It was bottle 280 out of 463 and retails for $700 (secondary is around $2,500). We know it has a low entry proof of 103 (hence the low cask strength proof of 114.2) it's sourced from KY and is age stated at 20 yrs old. Let's dive in...
It's really mouthcoating and oily... Big vanilla, toffee, cherries and plums upfront... Complex and proper Bourbon notes... Mature oak and old leather creep into the mid palate with baking spices... Long finish is all oak and caramel with some wood spice... Right at the tail end it's a tad drying... At no point did I even feel the proof... It's so well balanced and executed. 
In summary, this is one of the very best I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. Cheers all!"
