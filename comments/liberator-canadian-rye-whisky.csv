2.25,"This whisky is the classic Alberta ""rye"" flavor profile: Sweet caramel and alcohol. It's very light and ridiculously easy to put back. It's pretty much a vodka aged in oak. It's made for the rye and coke crowd. Disappointing since Highwood is touting this as a craft whisky. It loses more points for calling itself a Rye on the front label only to find out it's all corn and wheat on the back  label. This is typical of Highwood and they need to stop perpetuating this Canadian ""rye"" confusion. Step your game up Highwood."
