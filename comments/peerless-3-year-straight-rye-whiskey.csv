4.0,Very warm up front. Lots of butterscotch and vanilla followed by smoke. A little sharp and a little bitter back of tongue after taste. Big fan.
3.5,"I liked it but didn't love it - though I had after the bourbon, so not sure if it messed with my taste buds."

2.0,Very young and spiky. A little better with water and the after taste after a minute or two is where it shines. Just needs more time to mellow.

4.0,"Aroma of some vanilla, herbal notes (mint) and some cedar sweetness present.  Flavor screams Rye and is salty, vanilla, almond, Cedar. Opens to honey and amped up vanilla  and then marzipan opens very nicely.  Be patient with this in the glass.  Interesting in that it seemed almost too salty early, but this comes into balance. (salted caramel kind of thing. (I did taste next to Whistle Pig 10 year and WP won by a good distance)"
4.25,"Nose: rich sweet vanilla with hint of citrus
Palette: rich oily spices, orange peel
Finish: lingering spicy citrus"
