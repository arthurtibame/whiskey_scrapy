3.0,"Simple, all around good bourbon. Nose of oak, sawdust, under ripe bananas and old grass.  Oak, corn and a warm astringency on the tongue.  85/100"

3.0,Not as good as EHTSB ‘96
4.0,"I really liked this one. A much more mellowed bourbon, with very sweet toffee notes, vanilla and flan caramel (creme caramel). Delicious. Same sweet notes with some red fruits too. It is like any other bourbon but a little bit refined, with more bite. Sorry for the simple review. 80 over 100. Slainte!"

3.75,"Sweet, light, a little spice. With some water, vanilla and caramel ice cream Simple, easy supper for a low, low price.  $19.00 for 1.75 L.  It's a keeper for me"
3.0,"New bottle this time. Maybe my favorite “cheapie”. Way better than Benchmark, almost Buffalo Trace quality. Why not in MI?!,!"
