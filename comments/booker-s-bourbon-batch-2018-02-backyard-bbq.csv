5.0,A fine Bourbon that goes well with a cigar.  Strong alcohol content and works well sipping.  Anything more than that will bite your palate.

3.0,"@Richard-ModernDrinking and I attended a Beam Suntory event in central NJ, and this was offered in the master class.  Way too potent for me.  I needed to supplement it with 25% water.  Can’t recall exact notes, but it wasn’t striking enough for me to actually want one.  Instead the Knob Creek 2009 rye really was the highlight.  And the fried chicken.  Will be getting more of that fried chicken."

5.0,"nose: alcohol, and popcorn.
neat: powerful dunno. full mouth feel. definite spice on the finish and lingers a long time 

ice (1/2 cube):  opens up flavors. brings out the sweetness, cuts the burn"
4.5,"Nose - Vanilla, Brown sugar candied and roasted pecans (close to burnt but not quite).
Taste - Tons of spice and nutty notes, Almond butter and almond brittle come to mind, Tobacco and Vanilla jump out every few sips.
Finish - Medium and a bit harsh at times, big vanilla and nice allspice and cinnamon combo.

I prefer it with 4-5 drops of water for a 1.5oz pour."

4.0,"The nose starts with rye spice and brings in toffee and vanilla. The palate is sweeter, again with the toffee and vanilla combination. Eventually, tobacco emerges. It has a medium finish that is a little warm, with a little smoky tobacco."

5.0,I’ve really enjoyed the first 2018 Booker batches. Flavorful and strong!
4.0,"Matches the description listed.  Strong, and bold."

3.0,"Nose- cinnamon, black pepper, sweet tea.
Body- Very hot on the tongue. Butter and cinnamon are present which gives an almost snickerdoodle flavor
Finish- Mint and dark tannins."

4.0,Another solid effort from Booker's. Spicier than Kathleen's batch. Upon entry you are hit with rich burnt brown sugar and caramel. Mid pallette has a decent rye and clove swell. Some peanut notes as well. Long finish with vanilla and tobacco. Decent Ketucky hug. Drinks well neat but also benfits from a little water to tame the spice. Solid 4/5.
5.0,"traditional bourbon notes, we'll balanced, and the high proof doesn't bite like many high proof bourbon"

5.0,"Wow. Carmel and pecan pie on the nose. More Carmel, Tobacco, and oak on the pallet. Long oily finish. Amazing. 5*"
4.0,"Amber color. Brown sugar and a hint of tobacco and leather nose. Heavy and oily, salt and burnt wood on the tongue. A not unpleasant bitter note on the end, not surprising given the high alcohol content."

4.25,definitely some similarities to Kentucky Chew. still getting a nice sweet butterscotch taste. maybe a little more heat. very good

4.0,Vanilla and faint peanut butter. Nose is hard alcohol. You need to sneak up on this to get the profile. Finish is great. Buttery and smooth one of my favorites.I let it set in a brandy glass for about five minutes.
4.0,Nice and smooth w no heat. Full flavor w chewy finish.  Little thin between forward and finish

3.75,"creamy, love the strong proof. little earthy to me like whistle pig. would buy a bottle"
3.75,Not as good as some batches but still a good drink.  Spice and bananas up front with a punch of alcohol. Better on ice than neat as it allows the sweetness to shine through for me.
3.75,"This was a lower-rated bourbon for many as it did not live up to many of the fantastic Bookers batches released before it. It is, however, a supercharged Jim Beam, echoing the traditional mainstream whiskey with rich flavors and balance all its own. 

Nose: charred oak and sweet corn—it’s a more complicated and satisfying Jim Beam white label

Palate: candied nuts, bright fruits, hints of butterscotch 

Finish: very warm and long when neat, but more approachable and sweet after several drops of water; it’s slightly drier than the nose and palate predicted but it’s a good balance, vanilla baking spices at the end, but still it’s a rather sweet finish 

A solid Bookers batch and if I were recommending a specific batch to Beam lovers to expand their horizons this would be it."

4.0,"Coming in hot. It’s rich, flavorful, and tastes like it’s been aged more than 6 years. I always put over ice. It’s complex and sure is an acquired taste. I’m starting to like it more and more"

3.5,nice aroma and flavor but what a bite
4.25,"Rested 10 minutes. Served neat in a Glencairn. Enjoyed in a backyard with friends. 

Nose - really nice. Caramel, vanilla, oak, heat, 
Palette - extremely fruity, flavor explosion, cinnamon, vanilla, 
Finish - lingering flavor with quick heat. 

One of the more unique bourbons I’ve had. Really enjoyed this one."
3.0,"Neat - just a whole lot of fire and spice. Was the last couple of pours for this bottle so it had been open a while, still not much flavor to discern aside from the baking spices. Probably my least favorite of the 2018 lineup"
4.0,"Coming back to this after a few months...

Nose: candy corn, vanilla, fruity

Palate: rich with sweet and bright, with spicy vanilla, hints of butterscotch; the oaky flavors are rich but not overly oaked likely due to the only six years of aging 

Finish: medium with some lingering spice. 

A dash of water brightens this bourbon up and reminds me a lot of Bakers which is probably my favorite of the Beam
small batches behind Knob Creek."

4.5,"My hottest Bourbon to date @ 128.8 Proof. 

Nose: heavy cinnamon bread, caramelized sugar/creme brûlée 
Palate: viscous with toasted marshmallow, brown sugar & leather. Rich. 
Finish: long and the heat is only at the end."
3.75,"Coming back to this after a few months. If you like Bakers you’ll like this. Its profile is reminiscent of Bakers although that bourbon has a more consistent sweet bbq note. 

Nose: peppercorns, mint, hint of caramel

Palate: vanilla spice and slight sugars but...

Finish: short and dry finish

Not the best Bookers has to offer but it’s a solid small batch. Reminds me of a higher proof Beam Bottled-in-bond. I prefer Bakers to this specific batch."
