2.75,"When I initially tried this, the alcohol taste and burn were overwhelming. I revisited it nine months later and it has definitely mellowed out.

Nice copper color in the glass. Some alcohol present on the the nose along with some wood and vanilla. Taste similar to the nose with the wood dominating the medium finish. Mouthfeel is on the thin side.

I'm curious to see this aged a little longer or maybe in a different barrel (or both).  The taste is like the All Points West Malt and Grain Whiskey. No suprise there since the mash bills are similar and abv is identical."
3.75,A little smoky and earthy with some butterscotch.
4.0,"Soft notes of vanilla and toffee wrapped in a malty, bready mouthfeel followed by a long, light oak finish."
