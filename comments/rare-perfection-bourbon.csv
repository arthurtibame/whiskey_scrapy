4.75,"Tasted the Rare Perfection 14yr Lot 04 at the Preservation Distillery, along with what seemed like the full lineup of Preservation offerings (incl. a few different batches of Very Old St. Nick). This bottle was the stand out, for sure. Lots of oak, traditional bourbon flavor, and a bit of funkiness. Really unique. Really dang good!"
