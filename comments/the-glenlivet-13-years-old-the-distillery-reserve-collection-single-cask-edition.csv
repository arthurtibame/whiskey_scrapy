4.25,"Since i am Pernod Ricard's Brand Ambassador for Ecuador, i was invited to Linn House, Chivas Regal Castle and spiritual home. There the hosts kindly offered us some rare whiskies, and there was this collection that you can only get at the distillery. Exclusive bottles from each of Pernod Ricard's main distilleries, one of them, the famous and best selling, THE GLENLIVET. 

This Distillery Reserve Collection are mostly single cask strength whiskies, that contain raw, powerful flavor in a super enjoyable way. The bottles are all 50cl and they mantain a label that looks almost the same for each expression. 

Well, having access to those delightful whiskies is an opportunity that you can't let pass without taking advantage. So i drank a lot of them. 

So, this review is for the Glenlivet 13yo Distillery Reserve Collection, bottled at 61.9%abv. 

Everything here is so full of aromas and flavor due to the high abv, but very easy to find and detect, this is a very well crafted whisky. 

On the nose: Chocolate, Apples, Almonds, Vanilla. It smells very refined and fancy.
Letting it breath releases figs and jam.

On the palate, you don't feel the 61.9%abv at all. Pineapple, Cinnamon, Toffee, Oranges and old figs. Clean flavors. Aftertaste is an atomic spice bomb. Here is where you truly experience the abv of this dram. 

Overall this is a wonderful whisky. You can get all the flavors that you will find in various Glenlivet whiskies but all in one. Its like the real core and heart of this distillery in a bottle. Very fruity and spicy, my score for it is 89 over 100."
