4.0,"Very strong spice and warming effect, with sharp mineral flavor. Has a resinous woody flavor followed by very light honey, smoke, and lightly sweet, honey, vanilla, fruity finish. (Apple/Ester-like) texture like roasted peanuts with the skin, and popcorn, with a long finish of cherry-like brightness."
