3.5,"This is a good, blended whiskey to share with friends who aren't quite on board with whiskey yet.  Its smooth and very sweet.  It isn't complex but the character of the whiskey is agreeable with no harshness or off putting tastes commonly found at this price point.  I enjoyed this neat as I found an ice ball really watered it down too much."
