2.25,"Appearance: The color on this Canadian blend is a light caramel. It’s legs are medium-thin and watery.

Nose: this dram doesn't possess a strong bouquet, but you can tell it’s typical Canadian sweet: notes of vanilla, maple, caramel, with a slight note of wood furniture cleaner funk.

Taste: The thin palate has notes of sweet corn, faint maple syrup, pear, and lemon.

Finish: There's a fast finish with no burn to speak of. One is left with a slightly bitter and ashy aftertaste.

Thoughts: This bottom shelf whisky is (in my humble opinion) not that bad, it's not going to be a hero by any means, but it isn't offensive. It actually has characteristics that remind me of tequila, so I actually made a margarita with some of this whisky to see how it holds up, and it really wasn't half bad! Thanks you guys! Cheers!"
