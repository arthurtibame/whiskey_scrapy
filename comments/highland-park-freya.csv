5.0,"Some sensory experiences are difficult to articulate in terms germane to the other senses.  The nise, the mouthfeel, the evolution of the taste over time: all these are like the sonority of a fine concert piano, or of a lover.  Freya, goddess of love and war and Chief of the Valkyries, is the best possible namesake for this prepossessing, sensual dram.  Don't be fooled into thinking that the age statement implies lack of polish or power.  This bottle has pride of place on my shelf."
5.0,"For 15 yr old, it's really impressive.  Reminded me of a cross between the best well aged single pot still Irish but having the complexity of a scotch.  The floral notes are followed by a sweet , spicy taste and a salty finish very typical of Highland Park.  The key question---if you takeaway the fancy stand and the Viking marketing----is it worth its price tag considering it's only a 15 yr old? One of the few times I think it is----namely because you simply can't find this combination of floral, sweet, salty elsewhere"

5.0,"Nose: mild sweet smoke and hint of green apple, sweet hay, too good! 
Palate: wet, vanilla cream, spiciness hint of cinnamon hearts
Finish:"
5.0,Wonderful. Smooth with a full mouth feel. Delicate floral notes transform into a warming spice before leaving you with the lasting earth of familiar peat.

4.0,"Full of flavoring in aroma for a 15-year Scotch, with bright vanilla and mildly tart fruity aftertaste."

4.5,I finally get to try this! Highland Park is my favorite and Freya is no exception. I have a preference for the more heavily sherried like Odin but this might just be the best Bourbon aged whisky out there. Tropical fruit and light peat and it goes down surprisingly well considering the cask strength. 95
