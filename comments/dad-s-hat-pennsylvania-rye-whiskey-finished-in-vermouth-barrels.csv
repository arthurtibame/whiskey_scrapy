2.0,"Not a fan, very syrupy wine taste. For me the vermouth is too forward, doesn't let the rye come through. Maybe better in a cocktail."

1.75,"Spice presents itself immediately. A wave of red hots hits the palate with maybe a touch of caramel before giving way to the sticky sweet vermouth finish: grape, honey, and an almost cough syrup-like herbaceous bitterness. When this finally gives way it allows mint, parsley, more bitters, and heat to carry the flavor on it's way out."
3.0,"Nose was off putting, black licorice and bandaid. Tastes much better. Big notes of vermouth but not overwhelming. Very solid, first taste of dads hat"
0.5,"N: Very light if any
P: Very sweet before it hits that herbal note. Probably the vermouth, either way it's trash.
F: Bitter and medicinal."
