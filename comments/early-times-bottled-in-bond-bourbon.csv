3.0,"This reminded me a lot of Evan Williams Bottled-in-Bond White Label, which I enjoy.  There is a lot of sweet vanilla and caramel on the nose and palate, but the finish is short and just ""okay"".  Worth buying a bottle if it's released in your area."

5.0,I am in awe of how good this is. Tastes like crackerjacks with a subtle hot kick. I will pick up another bottle each and every time I see it. I like this a lot.
5.0,"This is a great bourbon for the price(as are most BiB). Smells like a Rickhouse. Vanilla, carmel, graham cracker up front with a peppery burn medium finish. It’s a nice everyday drinker that I wish would stick around."
4.0,"Enjoyable BIB! Heavy vanilla/caramel up front, sweetness gives way to candied fruit, pleasant warmth, and smooth going down. Good Value / will not be my last bottle."

Carmel, honey, oak. Medium long finish with pepper and cinnamon. This stuff is fantastic. 

Skip the hunt for blantons or eagle rare and pick this up."

3.5,"As I’m sitting here watching the Saints and Rams make for an entertaining Sunday afternoon I decided to pour a bourbon sample that was given to me by @pollywollydoodle.  Early Times BiB uses a mash bill of 79% corn, 11% rye and 10% malted barley. Bottled at 50% ABV and is natural color of dark rusty copper and I suspect is chill filtered. 

The nose starts with toasted oak, lots of cherries which is a nice find, grilled plums and caramel. Corn, but not too intense, especially considering the high percentage being used, mint and vanilla. Candy corn and some faint cotton candy. Overall not very sweet though. Almonds, anise and some light ginger. At the bottom of the glass I swear I got some toasted sesame seeds, really interesting. 
Water brings out more vanilla, some maple syrup and faint barley. 

The palate is all oak, pepper and wood spice on the arrival. Vanilla and light caramel with some faint cherries. Barrel char, black tea and brown sugar. Slightly harsh at times but it too bad. 
Water takes the spice down a little but adds nothing. 

A medium to full bodied mouthfeel that is oily, mouthwatering and tongue coating. 
The finish is medium length with oak, tea, pepper and anise. 

Not bad for a younger bourbon, but not too complex and the harshness that comes and goes on the palate is a negative hit. Good base flavors, somewhere between a sipper and a mixer. Water really helps you sip a little easier and I suspect this would be pretty good over a big ice ball. 3.5
Cheers"

3.75,"Boy this is a tough one.  You know how you head for the liquor store ""knowing what you want""......and POOF! you get there, the spirit you want isn't there?  Well, I was looking for a second row bottle for the the decanter......(lots of good choices).  The sales clerk introduced me to a third row bottle....What the heck?....100 proof bib for $22.00 for a full liter. (You know how you hate that a 750ml bottle ""goes FAST"".)   Brought it home....did the usual stupid rituals .....not too bad!  It seems like this would be a special treat for the ""shooter's"" in your crowd, but a bit of a harsh sipper.  I gave this spirit 3.25 stars, PLUS 1 half star for being a good bargain.  I will keep this spirit around  for mixed drinks and shooters."

4.0,Good. Pretty good.
3.25,"A close cousin to OF signature with a slight variation on the mashbill. BIB gives you at least 4 yrs aging and 100 pf so that's a plus. Poured neat its got a hit of ethanol but bold oak and musky leather offset with dark fruit and nuts. Palate comes in strong and hot with caramel and barrel with char, pipe tobacco and leather notes that make it seem older. Finishes with heated spicy caramel and some fruit turning to dry lengthy oak. It carries its proof in full and then some as does the OF sig but does not detract from the experience. Had this back to back with the OF 1897 BIB which is unfair with the costs of each. Of course the 1897 is more refined and deeper flavor etc but this Early Times is a budget brand and at that level it excels . Think of it as OF 1897 in high school realizing the talent but not quite polished and still working on skills........82/100...... a bit raw and underdeveloped but mighty enjoyable at price point"

4.25,"Butterscotch and cookies on the nose that give way to vanilla extract and oranges on the palate. Finish is very clean, lacking in some of the depth of finer bourbons. Definitely a steal for the price though and worthy of being an every day bourbon."

4.0,"This is really good bourbon, and not just because of the cost.  The nose is very floral, with hints of caramel, almost Werther's Candy-like.  The Wether's is more expressed in the palate, with other notes of vanilla and toffee.  It's very sweet, but in a good way.  The sweetness continues in the finish, but mixes well with the oak that just barely gets expressed before fading away."

Color... A very rich medium to dark copper..

Taste... Oats, heavy butter, apricots, bananas, vanilla ice cream, dessert undertones...

Overall.... This BIB is remarkable. I have tasted Bourbon at prices which are much higher and unworthy of their cost. This BIB however is truly fantastic for the price. If it were priced at $45 to $55 people would purchase it if the liquor store were to carry it on a higher shelf. It's flavor is rich, textured, and gratifying. A fantastic bourbon at just about any price..."

3.0,"Vanilla, Spice, and everything nice in a BiB bourbon. Vanilla, Orange, and Caramel on the nose. Leather and varnish taste and definitely some of that 100 proof burn going down. This is a great bottle for the price."
3.75,"It’s been years since I’ve had the standard issue Early Times. I bought a bottle when I was poor and just out of college solely because it was cheap and I thought the name was funny. I just imagined alcoholic’s saying “It’s never too early, for Early Times”.
Anyway, I’ve heard good things about this relatively recent Bottled In Bond line. Let’s check it out.

The nose has caramel, maple syrup, oak, bread, banana and other baking spices (including rye) and a hint of cooked plumbs.

The palate has on the thicker/oily side. There’s caramel sweetness, oak, banana, some baking spices,and a hint of dark fruit.

The finish is long and nice with lingering charred oak.

This was pretty good! I’m surprised what you get out of this. And for being 100 proof, there’s really not much of a burn after the 1st sip. It drinks like 90 proof. And because if that, I can tell it’s been proofed down, if that makes any sense. I would love to try a cask strength version of this."

4.5,I’m a big fan. I get the caramel & vanilla that I like in my bourbon & the 100 proof gives just the right kick.
3.0,"Standard vanilla on the nose and palate. However, the butterscotch undertones in the nose really come through on the palate! Not harsh at all, very smooth. I didn't get spice at all (which was fine because I like the sweeter profiles), so if you like spice that might be a strike against it. Definitely will be in the rotation."

4.25,"Neat. Neck pour.  Immediately greeted with a dark pumpernickel bread and baking spices.  Around the edges I get vanilla and caramel and cinnamon.  Very light apple and cherry.  Really nice and balance, no ethanol or detection of its cheapness.

Creamy, light on the tongue.  The notes upfront are lighter than I was expecting.  Simple syrup sweetness on the tongue, gives way to the vanilla, caramel, and cinnamon.  The dark notes on the nose don’t come back on the legs and leaves you with those baking spices.  Slight Kentucky hug to remind you of the proof.  Dries out the mouth and leaves you with more oak on subsequent sips.

What an amazing value.  This is good whiskey through and through.  It’s creamy and light as air texture is probably my favorite and most surprising quality.  The drying and bitterness that I am getting over time is the only fault."
3.75,null
3.25,A more muted Woodford. Much of the same flavor profile is there without the sweet presence.
3.5,"Nose: caramel, root beer, chocolate, cherry
Taste: really not getting much other than peanuts.  Bottle was sitting in a cold car for a couple hours so that could be dulling the flavor.  
Finish: peanuts, pretty dry
After reading reviews: I didn’t really get any of the notes listed by Distiller and couldn’t find many reviews beyond that.  Really nice nose but fell flat on the palate, so I’m hoping that’s just a function of it being left in the cold and me burning my mouth earlier in the night."
4.0,"Very sweet slightly leathery nose. Super sweet and oaky palate turning to maple syrup and finishing hot in the chest. Adding ice brings caramel apples and mellows the finish. Distinctly Brown Forman, reminiscent of Old Forester. I like it. $25 for a 1L bottle."
4.0,"BACKGROUND: Long considered a lower-shelf offering, Brown-Forman decided to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Early Times bourbon by releasing a bottled-in-bond version in 2017. It quickly became a cult favorite within the bourbon community and is routinely selected among the best products of its kind in blind tastings conducted by podcasters and YouTubers.

The Early Times BiB is manufactured pursuant to the Bottled-in-Bond Act of 1897, which was passed by the U.S. Congress (hence the ""I'm Just A Bill"" figure in the photo) to ensure the highest standards in whiskey production and mandates the following requirements:

The bourbon must be made at a single distillery,
The bourbon must be produced by one distiller in one distillation season.
The bourbon must be aged for at least four years in a federally bonded and supervised warehouse.
The bourbon must be bottled at 100 proof.

According to the Early Times website, this BiB bourbon is made with a mash bill of 79% corn, 11% rye and 10% malted barley.

The bourbon's distribution is somewhat limited, and its popularity has made it rather difficult to find, but after due diligence, I got my hands on a bottle and had the following reactions.

NOSE: The Early Times BiB has a rather sweet nose with the usual bourbon scent of caramel, but there is also a definite maple syrup foundation, as well. Despite the fact that the bourbon is aged only four years, there is a strong oak presence. I also detect just a hint of straw or hay.

PALATE: Much like the nose, the palate is a sweet one with the overwhelming flavors of children's cherry cough syrup and oak. Try as I might, I cannot get beyond those two predominate tastes. . .but I enjoy them.

FINISH: The flavor finish is medium in length, but there is no real burn or hug despite its 100 proof. The flavors turn from very sweet in the front of the mouth to slightly bitter on the finish, but not in an unpleasant way.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: The Early Times BiB is an easy sipper when consumed neat in a glencairn, but its affordable $23 (average) price for a one liter bottle won't stop you from using it in cocktails. I understand why this great value bourbon is getting more and more difficult to obtain. If it were easier to acquire in my area, I'd definitely add it to my daily drinker rotation. I give it four out of five cork pops."

4.0,Very nice full flavor and surprisingly pleasant finish.  Great value.
3.5,"Early Times BIB $26
NOSE: Sweet. Caramel, Oak, Straw, Rye. A good bit of Dried Spices like Clove and Cinnamon. A Hint of Orange Peel. Maybe some Dried Cherry and Dark Chocolate. There is a hint of the Latex Paint note I find in Brown-Foreman, but not as pronounced as OldFo or Woodford. There is a hefty note of Ethanol in the background, but not enough to be unpleasant.
NEAT: This is Super Sweet. Nice Heavy, Clingy and Syrupy Mouthfeel. There is a nice jolt of Spicy Tingle. You get Vanilla, Oak, Cherry Cough Syrup, Black Coffee along with a pretty prominent Bitterness. Bitter Oak and Cherry linger and coat after a nice warming medium length finish. I'm betting this bitter note would help offset the sweetness of an Old Fashioned. 
SPLASH: Gets rid of the alcohol on the nose and reduces the bitterness on the palate.
VERDICT: A new product for us here in NC. It's roughly the same cost and proof as the Signature OldFo, but it has a clingy characteristic I really like that the OldFo is missing. I can definitely see this being a repeat buy."

With first taste however, it's creamy on the tongue and hits the taste buds with a beautiful charred Hickory that you wouldn't expect from the brand.

For the money especially, one of the best BIBs I've had."

3.0,Stewed fruit nose with banana seeping through. Extraordinary smooth and creamy mouth feel. Vanilla is the dominate taste with a burning overtone. This is thin but not offensively so.

I think Lux Row got a great batch of barrels in, because this aged incredibly well.  Assuming 4-5yrs, this gives you all you need to know on the nose.  Vanilla, spice, and a hint of bright fruit.  Definite vanilla bomb.  You get some oak, but nothing old or dusty/musty.  Solid finish.  This is just as good as it gets for a 4-5yr old whiskey.  4.2/5"

The sweetness dissipates into a faint leathery smokiness that holds on surprisingly long for a flavor so mild. Overall, great for sipping with an emerging variety of light flavors. But also great for mixing at a price this low for the quality of the spirit. Personally it checks all the boxes."

4.25,"Neat in a glencairn.  An appealingly deep coppery-amber.  The nose offers toffee, caramel, baked apples, clove, cut jalapeno, and a hint of raisin... but carries some fumes, so prepare thy nostril.

The palate is thick, hot, and strong.  Boldly-flavored caramel, oak, and spice.  Loads of brown sugar with banana, vanilla, and that cherry cola version of spiced oak that I find quite pleasant.  Charred orange.  A drying sweetness lingers nicely and invites anther sip.

The best bold flavor profile + cost comparison I can think of is Wild Turkey 101. This is simultaneously more flavorful, more viscous, and cheaper ($22/L) than it's closest Brown-Forman comparison, Old Forester Signature, all at the same proof.  I have honestly thought to myself ""wow, this stuff is delicious"" each and every time I've tasted it and am more than a little scared to draw comparisons with my much-adored Old Fo' 1920 whiskey spouse for fear of poisoning the love we share.  I react with an eerie similarity to it, but it is much, much, much, much more expensive.  I'll just enjoy my pour and leave that for another day."

3.5,"Nose is very faint; orange peel, brown sugar, leather, and musty rickhouse. 

The palate matches the nose pretty closely with caramel, vanilla, and candied orange. VERY simple profile but there is some richness present to compensate. Nary a hint of oak, so if your looking for that you have the wrong one here. 

Very “traditional” finish of cinnamon bears candy and black pepper that’s over in a flash. After the spicy notes vanish there’s a nice lingering note of praline which is a pleasant surprise. 

Mouthfeel is pretty full and lush for a budget whiskey. 

Make no mistake with a such a basic flavor profile and short finish you would never confuse this with a top shelf offering, but it’s pretty solid. At 21.99 for a LITER, this is definitely one of the best values around. It would be perfect for cocktails, but not unenjoyable as a neat pour. To be honest, it’s probably not going to replace the ever-so-excellent WT 101 as my go-to budget offering of choice, but who’s going to knock a decent bourbon at a great price point?"

4.0,"Every so often I pull this bottle from behind the back of my collection and have a pour. This is my opinion of the best ‘budget bourbon’. Can hold its own against pours 3x the cost.

Love the rye notes. Bright, but such a smooth finish. Surprised every time I try this."
