3.5,"Nice, but a bit boring whisky"
1.0,A bit of a nice smell til you get to pure alcohol. Tastes like gas. Pure gas.

3.5,"Orange on nose.
Lot of fruit notes on the nose.

Very similar to a Speyside whiskey
Soft but with spice

A real summer whiskey"

Sweet
Butterscotch 
No peat"
3.0,Lots of alcohol sting on the nose. Initial taste of barley then surprising amount of spirit at 46.3%. Lingering finish. Greatly improved by adding some water.

2.5,"Dram club 2 oz samples, the flight included Black Bottle, Tobermory 12, Deanston 12, Bunnahabhain 12 and Bunnahabhain Toiteach A Dha

Tobermory was malty and a Glenlivet like on the nose.  Short finish, citrus notes. 

Not a buy for me.  

My ranking was 1. Bunnahabhain Toiteach A Dha, 2. Black Bottle, 3. Bunnahabhain 12, 4. Tobermory 12, 5. Deanston 12"
4.0,"I get guava and other tropical fruits right off the bat.  Light and floral, but smooth and enjoyable.  It’s a nice summer whisky.  Very nice."
4.25,"Wood and cereal greet the nose, accompanied by a fresh floral note that caresses the nostrils. Pear tart, vanilla, honey, unripe banana, shortbread. Sweet orange and a splash of lemon. Sugar lump. Sweet but not cloying, with minerality that balances the aromas and freshness that lightens them.
Soft and warm on the palate, with cereal biscuits smothered in milk, honey, a lot of fruit (peaches, apricots, mango), candied orange, caramel. It flows away oily and mineral, as if some salt crystals had been sprinkled on the fruit. Pinch of white pepper and nutmeg. Pasty and rich.
Medium finish, made of wood, orange, pepper, cereals, light pinch of salt.
For a basic malt it already has a lot to say, complex and rich as few peers, with a more interesting smell than what it offers in the drink."
