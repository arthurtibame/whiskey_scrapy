3.5,"Mild smoke on the nose and in the finish but the bulk of this is smooth and mildly rich, luscious barley. Not insanely intense but that’s not a bad thing. Good neat."

3.5,"It’s not peaty, but it is very smoky.  Suggest adding a bit of water."

3.0,Lot of wood. Lot of sweetness. Butterscotch pudding character.

3.5,"Smoke up front, some heat coming in finishing with some sweetness of maybe apple and orange? Very interesting. Like a sweet scotch with some extra bite."
2.25,"For me, the wood completely overwhelmed everything else. It was comparable to sucking on woodchips."
2.75,Too strong of flavor for me. I can hardly concentrate on the flavors

2.5,Strong charred oak aroma with a hint of caramel.  Winter baking spices on the initial sip.  Bit of toffee and smoke on the finish.  Long spicy finish
1.5,"I did not like this dram. It was confusing from start to finish. Smoky, apple, astringent, maple. Though a single malt, it was a blend of smoked woods and a used bourbon cask that compounded what might otherwise have been a palatable whiskey."
