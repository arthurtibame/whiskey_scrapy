1.0,"Nose is nail polish remover with a hint of funky, rotting wood. Taste is very not as bad as the nose. Not much going on, just heat with a little sting on the tongue. Little bit of nail polish remover on the finish. Maybe I could mix this with ginger ale?"
3.25,"Overall, not bad. Sweet and a dash of honey on the front end, a small burn with a tad of oakiness.  It would be a head to head tie with this and Rebel Yell.  Mind blowing whiskey this is not but a pretty solid one for the price."
3.0,"This one surprised me. I was expecting a much less flavorful bourbon considering the age and price but it’s actually pretty good. 

After previously drinking back to back with Redemption’s bourbon this stuff is stellar. No finish but for a 101 proof bourbon it sips like a 80 proof. Smooth. Definitely worth the $23 I spent. Keep it up Hillbilly!"

3.0,"The mash bill is 78% corn, 18% rye, and  4% malted barley.  The bourbon is distilled in Lawrenceburg, Indiana and bottled in South Carolina. The color is an amber color and smells of spice and vanilla. You can taste caramel and vanilla with a finish taste of rye."
