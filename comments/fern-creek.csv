4.0,"Nose: up front I get the vanilla drizzled dark fruits with oak and caramel that fades with a little brown sugar

Pallet: up front you get the sweetness of vanilla, Caramel, brown sugar, with some hints of apple pie. The oak, corn, tabacco leaf and slight leather as the finish. Definitely not a bad pour to turn to. Definitely similar to some of heaven hill bourbon whiskey products"
