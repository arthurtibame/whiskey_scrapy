4.0,"Honey and salt but not as much salt as the 12yo.  There is a smokiness there too but that comes after the honey and toffee. 
Nice dram!"

4.0,"The NAS bottlings have been the weak spot of the Old Pulteney range in the past but this new one is a worthy exception. Finished in heavily peated casks from a Speyside distillery, it sports a spectacular nose that I would love to spend more time with. The peat presence is of the heathery variety and huge for a whisky that was only finished in empty casks, on a par with Balvenie Peat Week for example. The palate isn’t as exciting and the mix of the peat influence and the characteristic Pulteney marine flavors not as integrated as in an Islay, but it’s still a bottle I would happily drink at home. That’s true for any of the four core bottlings in the new Pulteney range, which is not something I can say about many distilleries. In other words, any pick from Wick will do the trick."

4.0,"Briny, vanilla buttercream frosting, hint of smoke in the finish. Very pleasant and drinkable. Hoping to see this in the US soon!"
4.0,"If you've already read @Richard-ModernDrinking's excellent review of the Huddart, here's my quick take - What he said!!

If you're still reading, a few additional thoughts -

The nose on the Huddart is absolutely devine.  Whenever I open a new whisky bottle (a small sample bottle in this case), I have a habit of smelling the first odor that escapes when the cork or top is removed.  In this case, a big ball of sweetness greeted me, akin to a sherry bomb.  But once in the Glencairn, it opened up to citrus and apple, vanilla and custard.  There's peat smoke as well, but it's so beautifully integrated with the fruits that It wasn't the first thing I noticed.  On the nose alone, this is at least a 4.75.  I was left wondering what would happen if I put it in an essential oil diffuser.  

Perhaps the only true negative about the palate is that it's a step down from the nose.  But there's some nice, gentle peat smoke on top of what tastes like typical Old Pulteney - paricularly brine and a creamy honey.  The finish is a bit bitter, but it's a dark chocolae and grapefruit bitterness that's enjoyable.

It seems that the Huddart has made its way to the US, because it's available at Federal Wines and Spirits in Boston (although they have a lot of unusual bottles and may be importing through alternative channels).  My understanding was that OP's full new core line was to have hit US stores early in 2019, so I'm a bit surprised I've not seen it in other locations yet.  As a result, I don't know what the typical US price will be and therefore have no basis for evaluating its VFM.  But it's a very worthy dram, and I hope to see it on shelves soon."

4.25,"clear peat on the nose, but not so overwhelming that you cant smell anything else. sweet undertones with a hint of vanilla and orange.
when sipping, the body is full and rich with clear barrel spices, and some peat. chocolate and dark fruit develops.
on the finish there is chocolate, and some tobacco, almost meaty. the finish is long. 
an amazing whisky for its price."
3.0,"Very very slight peat smoke, sweet definitely quite a tame one this, a bit like Talisker on the nose but tastes nothing like it."
2.75,"Old Pulteney tasting event, Sydney, February 26, 2020, Whisky #2

Nose: Very faintly peaty – just a bat-squeak of peat to start with but it does seem to amplify as the dram opens. A little lemony fruit, vanilla and a fleeting hint of menthol.

Palate: The arrival is led by smoke, and it is a little heavier in quality here than it is on the nose. Citrus, brine, hot spices and a little brown sugar on the development with some oak towards the finish. Over time, and particularly with the addition of water, the peat-reek gains a cardboard note.

Finish: Medium. Ashy smoke and brine.

The smoke lends weight to this whisky and it is very similar to the current 12 year old but with a veneer of smoke added. It’s actually younger (8-10 years) but the smoke gives it presence and heft that makes it seem older than it is.

The story (fable?) from the brand rep was that this was the result of a happy mistake when a run of spirit was accidentally filled into ex-bourbon casks that had previously held Laphroaig. Sounds like marketing to me.  It’s more likely they intentionally did an experimental run using ex-peaty whisky casks so they could jump on the “peat train” rather than run peated wash through the stills.

Regardless, the results were impressive enough to convince the distillery to make Huddart a core range product, but it’s not aged in ex-Laphroaig. The casks come from stablemate distillery Knockdhu, which produces a range of peaty whiskies.

To be blunt, I thought this was an entirely pointless whisky. OP has never been famous for smoky expressions and, however good it may be, the addition of this to the range is superfluous. At the asking price it's also a little expensive for what it is.

It's not that it’s at all bad, it’s a good gently peated dram and it has been well received by the critics. However there are several distilleries making exactly this sort of “aged-in-ex-peated-cask” expressions right now (Scapa, Wolfburn etc.) and Huddart is nothing special – just another faceless bystander in the crowd. Personally I think Wolfburn Northland is a considerably more subtle realization of this maturation concept and it leaves Huddart for dead.

“Average” : 2.75 stars"

4.25,"Stephanie's review is quite accurate. Ripe bananas also on the nose. Wonderful balance and complexity all around. Nice long heat in the finish. I'm a fan of Old Pulteney, but this is a notch above in intensity and complexity. 

One of three bottles I brought back from the UK fall 2019. I hope it's available in the states soon (without stupid tariff). A great find!"
