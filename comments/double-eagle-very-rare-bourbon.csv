4.75,"Have to give big time thanks to the VP of my company for this sample. 

Look: Dark amber, burnt orange in color, translucent, with the usual lacing 

Nose: crazy to say this, but I get a grape on the nose, followed by more barrel, and spice. Really perfumy in a good way

Palate: Fruity initially, followed by mild wood and then a bunch of cinnamon spice. 

Finish: there’s some slight heat but the finish is pretty mellow and enjoyable. Lot of flavor on the way down, cinnamon and oak. 

Overall: an impressive bottle, but I don’t think anything can justify the retail of this.  Would I love to have it? Absolutely."
