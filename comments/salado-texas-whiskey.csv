3.0,"Interesting nose.  It has hints of prairie flowers, clover honey, mild tobacco and a hint of smoldering wood.  Medium body.  Slightly sweet flavor but very balanced.  Neat this whiskey has flavors of nouget, vanilla, black pepper, mild wook in the background with subtle banana notes.  Adding a touch of water reveals notes of honeydew, canteloupe, white grapes, along with sorghum and caramel over a light toasted oak in the background.  Minimal pepper on slightly dry finish.  Enjoyable every day whiskey worthy of three and a half stars."
