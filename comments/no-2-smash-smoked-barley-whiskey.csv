4.0,Definitely get a smoky note similar to scotch. A touch of sweet. Feels complex
2.5,"Nose: Strong Cherrywood, oats, new oak barrel, grocery bag paper
Taste: Cherry malt candy cascades into barrel spice
Finish: dry, cinnamon candy, cherry wood throughout
Interesting whiskey, give it a taste for the experiment of it"
