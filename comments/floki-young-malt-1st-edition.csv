3.0,"Eimverk distillery named their young malt after Flóki Vilgerðarson, the first Norseman settler who came to Iceland. Too young to be called 'whisky', this spirit spent about 1-2 years in virgin American oak casks, which makes it almost reminiscent of a bourbon. The aroma is minty fresh with hints of solvents, vanilla and newly assembled furniture (IKEA). Young, crisp and oily on the palate, there is a delightful herbal freshness that migrates into the mineral and resin-bitter finish. Flóki is definitely an unusual dram that unfortunately comes with a hefty price tag.

null,"Nose: fresh wood just split, piles of new and old leaves, wood varnish, and hardware store. Smell is off putting at first, but it gets pleasant the longer I nose it. 

Palate: Very fresh wood, pumpkins (just carved), squash. Some vanilla, dead leaves, and green leaves.

Smooth, it doesn't taste young. This whisky tells a story with it being the first edition and one that's seasoning the barrels for other whiskies to come. I've never had anything like it. I won't rate it due to its nature."

2.25,Interesting nose profile that shows some potential in it. Still way too young to be considered whisky and the tasting as such is arguably not a recommended one. Still some positive notes come at the finish..

0.25,"I wanted to like it...

To be honest, this is the worst whiskey I've ever had in my life. I can barely bring the glass to my nose before the smell turns my stomach.

For anyone who has every worked with horses, the smell is unmistakable: that super grassy horse shit that is more mushed grass than actual shit. Like that damo bottom layer of half-rotten hay in the back of the the barn on the most humid day of the summer. The taste is exactly what you'd expect from the smell.

I couldn't drink it, had to pour the glass down the drain."

3.0,"Can't place the smell. Interesting flavour profile, but very smooth"
1.0,Tastes like hay or a pile of nettles.  Reminiscent of a barnyard.  Slight hint of iodine.  Opposite of smooth.

3.0,"Very Icelandic; notes of sheeps- woll and lard, did not leave a positive first impression, but will give it an other try later.

Same impresion secondat time tested, Thisted botle will last very long..."

2.0,"Floki is indeed unique. It’s not everyday you get to have a dram from Iceland. Being honest though, it’s not everyday you’d want one.

The nose is interesting, offering a very nature driven profile. It’s ripe with sappy and herbal tones immediately present. You’ll find honey and a deep molasses at the center. The bow wrapped around it all is leaves, forest and wet saw dust. 

Floki carries and extremely light palate with varnished wood and a clean rinse on the tongue. It’s there and it’s gone. That’s probably due to its very young age of 9 months.

On the exit, you’ll find some vigor in the form of belly heat returning a few seconds after swallowing.

This dram is a one and done. There isn’t any real reason to go back to it. Try it if you have the chance, hang you hat, then move on.

1.0,"Interesting? Sure. Any good? Not really. It is very young, and one would assume that a bit more time in the casks would improve it. But unfortunately that's not the case with Flóki. Having also tasted their 1st edition Malt Whisky (aged 3 years), it's safe to say that Eimverk still has a long way to go in making an agreeable dram."
