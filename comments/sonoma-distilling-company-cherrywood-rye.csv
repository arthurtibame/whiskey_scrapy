3.75,"Nose is plums, caramel and rye. Taste is a bit watery kind of reminds me of a watered down Willet rye with cherries, dried fruit and lemongrass. Cherry flavor sticks around on the palate for a medium length."
3.0,"This rye had a copper hue and glass walls of thin semi-watery legs.

The nose started out a little weird and fruity. Notes I got were funky sap, dusty old book, caramel, plum, apple, cherry candy, eucalyptus, alcohol, and barn straw.

The palate was watery and sweet, with brown sugar, Cutie orange, cherry candy, dill, and lemon zest.

The finish was medium length and tangy with orange. Cheers!"
