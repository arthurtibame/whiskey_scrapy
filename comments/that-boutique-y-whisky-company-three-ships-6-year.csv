3.75,"I saw this on MoM and thought hmm. I haven't tried this distillery, or in fact any spirit from South Africa from memory even though I've spent a bit of time there, so I grabbed a sample. Now the distillery releases were average but if anyone can rescue a spirit, show it some love and help it reach its potential it's Boutique Whiskey. And they have very nicely,  the first dram tonight I won't be tipping down the sink. Now they can't work miracles and they haven't, the scores given already seem slightly left eyebrow raising but definitely an improvement on what proceeded this tonight for me.
My wife is South African and we are heading back there mid year (hopefully given the coronavirus). Although i'm not huge into wine these days I LOVE visiting wineries. I got married in a vineyard region and I love traveling the world and popping into various regions. We will be in stellenbosch for a bit and I see that this distillery isn't too far away. I'm in two minds whether to visit (i have a habit of visiting waaay to many vineyards and burning through all my brownie points so not sure I'll have any to extend to this but looks a pretty distillery).
Anyhow it has the nose of a cherry bourbon but the palate has a fair bit more going on. Not to bad a balance on the alcohol versus flavor, not quite my style given the cherry flavors (must have spent a fair while in bourbon barrels) and slightly thin and you can tell the underlying spirit is a bit rough, but not to shabby at all. 
Right, off to renew my Typhoid and Hepatitis A vaccinations for the SA trip tomorrow morning so this will be the final dram for the night.
Po marie!"

5.0,"Got a sample of this from a friend. Very good stuff with lots of rum like qualities and notes of raisins, dried fruit, prunes, sultanas, chocolate, toffee, mango, passion fruit, banana, and pepper."
