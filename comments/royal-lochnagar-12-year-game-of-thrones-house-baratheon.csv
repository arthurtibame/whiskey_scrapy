3.75,"Nice light copper color with a rich complex nose. The flavor isn’t as intense as the nose and color might suggest, but still nice. Basically a darker, richer and zestier version of a normal Highlands scotch. Mouthfeel is a notch or two below “creamy”, but definitely not “thin”. Fun to try, but maybe not worth the price? 3.77."

4.0,"Light bodied, fruity, smooth, and clean. Got light fig and date flavor to it. Royal Lochnagar’s juice can be found in the higher end Johnnie walkers, so drinking this would definitely remind you some of the characters of JWs. Overall a pleasant daily dram."

3.5,"★★★½
La déception de la soirée.
J'avais énormément d'attente pour ce whisky emblématique de la maison qui a renversé le ""mad king"". Je m'attendais à quelque chose de puissant, de coriace, de violent. Je commence sérieusement à penser que tout ceci est vraiment un gros coup de pub pour des whiskys ordinaires..."

Nose: Caramel, Vanilla, 🍌
Palate: little Smokey, oily, nice easy taste. 
Finish: Short"
3.5,"Nose:  light, sweet, caramel, floral
Palate: thick mouthfeel, mild spice, rich, toffee
Finish: short to medium length, rich, mildly spicy 
Not very complex but still very enjoyable and drinkable."
3.5,"Nose starts dry before a burst of sweet and citrus.  Citrus is surprisingly absent in the flavor, which is earthier, warming."

3.0,"Nose- green apple jolly ranchers, oak, lemon zest, oranges

Palate- oak, pineapple, lemon, smoky undertones

Finish- Short, fruity finish with just a hint of smoke

This is unique, there’s not denying that. But with that being said, it’s very one dimensional. All I get on the nose, palate and finish are tropical fruits and oak. Usually I love this combo accompanied by other smells and flavors, but when it’s just the two, it doesn’t quite work for me. Still an alright drinker, but very simple and forgettable."
3.5,"Nose: simple with smells of orange and some vanilla. 
Palate: smooth with a little spice, medium flavors, easy to drink. Smokey finish."

3.5,"Malty, grassy, floral nose.

This is a fairly light whiskey- it's very grassy and floral.  I get strong rose petals/floral, honey, lemon, with a bitter herb/grass aftertaste, but the floral and honey notes persist into the finish.

The floral/honey elements are kinda surprising, as they are quite pronounced, and a bit unusual.

This isn't particularly complex, but it's pleasantly drinkable."
3.5,"Nose - pear, clove, honey, toast

Taste - vanilla custard, clove/allspice, maple

Not bad, pretty tasty after dinner whisky. Doesn’t live up the Talisker or Oban bottlings in the GOT line, but is up there."
