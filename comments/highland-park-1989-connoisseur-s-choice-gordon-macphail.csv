4.75,"NOTE: My first big whisky splurge. If whisky can be considered art then this is a masterpiece. The nose is daresay perfect. The palate is a well managed symphony of barrel aging over three decades. Yet I admit you do get 80% for 20% of the cost with a Bowmore 18 D&C. I may not buy many such bottles, but I’m satisfied to know what 99% looks like.

NOSE: At full 57% it’s hot to handle up close so tread lightly. You get stewed prunes and red apples baked in butter and cinnamon, then a strong undercurrent of tobacco and heather peat. Vanilla pudding is served at the edges. There is an old dusty book in there, and some wood varnish with leather polish to complete the library theme. Dilution with water doesn’t add anything, but makes it easier to appreciate. Exquisitely integrated.

PALATE: Undiluted is hot. After some added water you reveal layers of creamy vanilla pudding, sprinkles of sea salt, stewed peaches and strong cinnamon and clove spice. The finish lingers literally forever, oaky yes, but never sour or bitter. 

OVERALL: The profile reminds me of a marriage between 18 year old peated and sherried whiskies, but you can find the additional age in the nose especially. The oak is never overpowering. What a thing of true beauty."
