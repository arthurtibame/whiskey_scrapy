4.0,"Bold nose, raisins & prunes

Sweet taste, caramel and fruits, sherry.

Medium finish"
4.0,"Nose erupts with chocolate, ripe banana, grilled strawberries and spice. The palate is hot, which can be taken for pepper and more spice, or just burn and heat. Water settles this down a bit, brings out some light oak, malt and a mix of red fruits. The finish is long and drying. This is a sweet dram with a beautiful nose, but the palate is rough. I enjoy it, but others may find it just too young and abrasive."

4.0,"I enjoyed this. Don't let the cask strength scare you, the flavour still comes through nicely with minimal burn. Not super refined but enjoyable nonetheless. Fruity oak and pepper.
I think the regular price was $80 CAD. if you can find the Glengoyne 15, it is the sophisticated older sibling to this rambunctious cask strength."
