3.75,"Nose reminds me of my Dad’s shoe polish and my high school old library with some dark dried figgy fruit.  I could spend all night smelling this pour.  Great mouthfeel, full body with a little heat.  The figgy taste follows through to the finish that has a nice linger that revisits the nose.  8.1/10"

4.0,"Alright, so I’ve seen dramatic differing of opinions on this one. Saw it behind the counter for a decent price and thought I’d see what the fuss is or isn’t about.
The nose is immediately very christmassy. Cinnamon, cloves and other baking spices. Some fruitiness maybe raisins. Very reminiscent to my bottle of Rowan’s Creek (by Willett). 
The palate has a nice thicker mouthfeel that also feels juicy, interesting.
It’s sweet with the exact same notes I got on the nose. 
The finish goes down fairly nicely with a shorter side of medium length.

Conclusion, I actually am a fan of this. I can see how some might think it’s “an acquired taste”, but I really enjoyed it. I need to do a side-by-side with Rowan’s Creek. It reminds me of that one a lot and I’d be interested to see how they compare."

 Tried with a little coke and ..... no! Kinda just killed the flavor and became blah. 

Either neat or a lil water and this is a nice bottle to keep around"

3.75,Enjoyed neat in a glencairn. I liked this more than I was expecting to. The WFE rye is excellent but this is pretty good. I get a lot of vanilla and a lot of sweetness. A good amount of barrel too/ Thanks Dave for the sample. I may have to buy one of those ridiculous looking bottles next time I see it.

3.25,"Nutty at first, floral on the end, hot on the front smooth on the end. Does not last on the palate for very long."
1.75,"A sample bottle dthom picked up for me in San Francisco.  Can I just say it?  We're all thinking it.  The bottle, especially the full size one, is stupid.  It barely fits in a liquor cabinet and is super hard to pour.  This is a case of someone in marketing not consulting with anyone before making a decision.

Nose: Punches me right up front with peanut, peach, nougat, vanilla, and caramel.  If someone were to make a peach flavored Payday bar this would be it.  Kind of weird but also kind of pleasant.  A little bit of citrus and grass in the background as well.  Just a little bit of background funk that is sort of like banana or mango (tropical fruit) and sort of like the notes you get from a sherry finished single malt.  Weird but sort of good.

Flavor: Not nearly as complex or interesting as the nose suggests.  Kind of vaguely sweet with vanilla and brown sugar.  A little more background nuttiness but more like pecans or brazil nuts.  A bit bland really.

Finish:  Medium length with more barrel bitter than I'd like.  Some woody notes that clash a bit with the tropical fruit notes that assert themselves at the end.  Just a little peppery as well with some background mint notes.  Clashing flavors on the finish.

This one is just all over the place but the contradictory and seemingly random flavors don't really work for me.  Plus the bottle is stupid."

Taste... Like a bottle of Gin. Wasn't able to pick up Bourbon notes. Not sure what I'm drinking.

Overall... Not for me whatsoever. It's either that my taste buds are off or I've just found one I'm not into at all. If I were to guess the age of this Bourbon I'd say it were 2 years as it seems so immature. I will be giving the rest of this bottle away."

3.25,This is an unusual profile for a bourbon. On the nose I get fruit cake and limestone.  That unusual combination carries into palate. It’s sweet with a little mineral taste. Short to moderate finish. I would try this before buying. However the bottle alone is worth getting. Best bottle in bourbon.

Beautiful bourbon with a beautiful bottle."

Quintessential, to me, Willet grape must/pomace/grappa and bubblegum also appear (that I get truckloads of in their wild and delightful 4-year rye).  In bourbon form, a bit disjointed and not particularly impressive, but certainly drinkable and a quality spirit.  A bit “off-kilter” from mainstream, sweet/vanilla bourbons, but that could be good or bad depending on your preferences or expectations.  For the slightly adventurous."

3.0,"Meh- due to the uniqueness of the bottle, I think I was expecting more.  

Appearance: beautiful copper/caramel appearance.  Definitely passes the appearance test with flying colors. 

Nose:  oak and fruit.  I’m not sophisticated enough at this point to discern the difference in fruit smells, but it leans towards the citrus side.  

Palate:  as this review began - Meh.  Really nothing extraordinary.  Slightly spicy at the start.  Coats the tongue well.  Just not a ton of flavor, but it is not overwhelmed by an “alcohol” taste.  A little more leather taste than I like.

Finish: very mild burn as it hits throat. Leaves mouth a bit dry.  

Overall - I gave it a three but that’s probably more due to the packaging. At $38 it’s much cheaper in my area than most so I figured it would be a neat piece to add to my collection. Definitely not my preferred daily drinker, but will probably pour a dram once or twice a month."

2.5,"On the nose it's green, spicy, fresh. Feels like a rye, but there's a dusty corn note lingering in the background betraying that this is a Bourbon. This dusty corn then begins trading time with a sensation of green tea that becomes more and more prevalent the longer you sit with it. The taste adds a toasted vanilla finish to the mix, but the green tea and rye spice remain the defining features. It's an interesting dram, but ultimately too loud, brash, and young feeling to be anything beyond a novelty."

This time around I find it quite good.  It’s nothing new or fancy and it’s not worth over retail but it’s a cool bottle for your home bar.  Cheers!

There's some of the rye influence, but it shows up as grass and flower foremost, which gives way to some 🍞 notes.

3.25,"Heavy char/oak on the nose. Taste starts very full, rich, and leathery. Followed by a mild spice, finishing with a lingering vanilla/floral sweetness. Slightly disappointed by taste, still a great one to try and have for the collection!"
4.5,"Nose: corn, caramel, honey, pepper, oak
Taste: caramel, vanilla, oak, pepper, citrus"

2.5,"It's a very good bourbon that would be a great one to share at a tasting or gathering of friends. Of course the bottle will be the topic of most of the discussion.  

I don't know what I was expecting before tasting this bourbon, but it was not the caramel corn nose followed by a citrus forward palate. Sweet corn comes back at as well as a nutty flavor the finish .  

Definitely enjoyable, it's just more subtle than I was expecting.  I'll probably update my review once I go through repeated tastings (finish the bottle!)."
4.0,"Honey, spice, wood"
3.75,Rye bread for sure
4.25,Vanilla is very prominent and really doesn't let go. Very smooth.
3.0,"Orange peel and cinnamon spice on the nose.  Spice, leather"
2.75,"Very unique bourbon that hits you with a citrus, almost earl grey bergamot note and gives way to a delicate angel food cake and oak. While the finish may be short, it’s a fun journey to get there. Thinner mouthfeel and quick finish is what I would say are the shortcomings of this bourbon.

Rumored to be sourced from Heaven Hill and upon tasting I would agree."
3.25,"Slightly spicy and herbaceous.  This is a nice change from sweet bourbons but perhaps not quite at this price point.  On ice, there seems to be some rye spice that lingers."

4.0,To all those “bourbon experts” who say Willet isn’t any good: you are so very wrong.  Great bourbon.
4.25,Nose is fruity with a hint of cinnamon that becomes more prevalent on the palate. Good finish that leaves me with memories of Big Red gum. Provides a little something outside the normal bourbon experience.

4.0,"I think that I have found a true competitor to the Four Roses Single Barrel.  Similar to the Four Roses in the fact that fruit is evident in the palette, the Willett  is more of a citrus and floral that fades to a caramel compared to dark fruits of the Four Roses.

It truly is a delicious bourbon. Light and not too complex. There is a little bit of alcohol presence, but it is a pleasant warmth and not a burn. 

Since the flavor is so delicate, I don't think that it stands up well with water or over ice. It's also far too good to be used in a mixed drink. This is a bourbon best served neat.

The only bad thing about this bourbon is that here in Ohio, it is next to impossible to find. I had to trade a bottle of Weller Antique 107 to a friend in Indiana for this bourbon.  The price is reasonable, but it is a chore to obtain. I can find the Four Roses Single Barrel almost anywhere though for about the same price if not cheaper."

3.0,"First time trying this. Heard a lot of mixed reviews.

Nose - caramel, licorice, oak, leather

Taste - floral, licorice, and caramel lead the way then end in a pepper and leather medium finish. I get some bitterness which I really don’t like but everything else on the palate isn’t bad.

Overall value 
This is not an easy bottle for me to find. May be for some but I have not seen it in months which makes me wonder why. This is a unique bourbon, but I’m not sure it’s a good thing in this case. Found for $40. Very cool bottle and holds the willet brand name. Cool bottle but nothing special"
3.75,"Fairly good, in a pretty bottle. Not as good as Blanton’s (my go-to), but rather well-balanced, flavorful, and smooth. 

Honey and charred oak on the nose. A fair amount of caramel, a bit of vanilla, and a hint of apple in the taste."

4.25,"One of my favorites. Every time I’ve visited their distillery, it’s been fabulous!"
3.75,1 cube. Vanilla on the nose. Smooth with no heat. Excellent sipping bourbon at this price point.
