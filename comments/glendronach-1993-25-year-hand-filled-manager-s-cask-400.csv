4.5,7/2/19 - A taste from Glendronach.🏆
5.0,"25 YEAR OLD 1993 HAND FILLED 57.7%, cask 698"
5.0,"This was the distillery exclusive manager's cask available when we visited in late May 2018.  Distilled on Feb. 12, 1993, and bottled on December 8, 2017, this 24-something GlenDronach is hands down the best sherried whisky I've ever tasted.  At its cask strength of 53.6%, it is so thick that it feels more like a milkshake at times than a whisky, and its flavors lean in that ice cream shop direction as well.  Vanilla, chocolate brownie, malt, cherry, caramel, and cream all take a share of the limelight.  Two of the members of our tour group hand-filled bottles of this one at the end, and it was a treat just to watch them.  At 250£, it was out of reach for us for this trip, but this will become the ideal against which I judge all future sherried whiskies."
5.0,"Picked one of these up back in January while visiting the distillery. My bottle is 24 years, 11 months and 2 weeks old, damn the bad luck of going to Scotland 2 weeks early! Truly incredible whisky, Glendronach is masterful at selecting casks for these and the single cask bottlings. Dark fruit prevails, of course, but the malty backbone that runs under all Glendronach juice is there and really rounds it out. Toffee, caramel, milk chocolate and insert any dark fruit you can imagine. The prize of my whisky collection!"
5.0,"Thick and rich, with almonds, sweet plums and oak. The subtle wood spices on the finish is prolonged and warm. 

Divine!"
