3.75,"Pennsylvania made peated bourbon.  

Nose is an interesting mix of classic bourbon and peated scotch: buttery caramel, fireside smoke, oak, and cereals.

Taste is more buttery smooth bourbon, balanced smoke, sweetness, a tiny bit of brine, and some stone fruit.

Finish is short but pleasantly smokey."
3.0,"Earthy, smoky nose as expected with a nice warm smoky flavor that is not overpowering but gives it a unique flavor almost like a scotch in my opinion."
