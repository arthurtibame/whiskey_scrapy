4.0,"The more you sip on this bourbon the more you grow to appreciate it! Apparently the bourbon is aged in Tannat wine grape barrels for at least 6 months before bottling. The bourbon is a traditional Tennessee whiskey, but the nose on it is unique. You smell a floral note, maybe even a red wine or rose’ aroma. Then you pick up the sweetness and caramel fragrance. Next, the front tasting notes will hit and you may pick up some heat and then it balances out. I was able to pick up corn, caramel, and vanilla. However, on the back end the wine finish is apparent. Definitely one to pick up and keep in the collection or to share with friends."
