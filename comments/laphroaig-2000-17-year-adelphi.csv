3.0,"This was the big disappointment of my Adelphi tasting last week. A collective groan went up from the room as people recoiled from the hugely sulphuric nose. I don’t mind a bit of sulphur, but this one was close to diabolical. Hard to rate under the circumstances — I didn’t have much patience for it after so many outstanding drams throughout the evening — but I certainly would be happy to give it another go."

3.75,"Dramfest '18. I was commenting to LeeE and GP whilst the festival was amazing it wasn't a VIP spectacular but then adding reviews I thought I did get to try 16, 17, 20 and 25 year Laphroaigs and similar calibre for other distilleries at just over $1 a pop! I saw another Adelphi dram I missed out on tasting going for $40 a dram in a whiskey bar I frequent so I definately got my moneys worth! This dram was a typically great Adelphi drop and one of 560 bottles. Not in the same league as the 16 2000 Hunter Laing however. 3.75."
