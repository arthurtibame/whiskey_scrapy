4.5,"Hands down one of the more interesting whiskeys I have had the pleasure of tasting. Love the bourbon barrel influences, those old fired wood flavours come in beautifully if you wait and sip slow! It's subtle and smooth, but the flavour composition of this bottle has helped improve my palate to no end! Wonderful, don't know why this isn't rated higher."

2.0,"Not sure what's going on with this sample but my experience is polar opposite to PBM and others who rated highly. Either dud batch, air contaminated sample or dare I say forgery as this is even more average then the typical mid ranged overpriced japanese fare which is served up these days. There is very very little going on, pretty much ethanol and extremely vague hint of sweet wood. I know my palate isn't one for subtlety but unless there is some unbelievable delicate complexity that I'm missing its so bland its a 2.5 tops."

5.0,"I opened up a small 50ml sample I had from some time ago.  I don't even think these are available anymore, the aged version is replaced fully by the NAS.  I wish I bought a full bottle...but, not knowing what this blend was, I was apprehensive of getting a full bottle.  Having had the Hibiki 12 and 17, I think this is better than the 12, and right up there with the 17.  Nose is floral, like cherry blossoms.  Really delicate and mild mannered, but that's not to be confused with 'boring'.  Taste extends the delicate profile.  More of the cherry blossoms, but now augmented with  violets, and green apples.  Really a great profile...not like a Lowlander, but just something totally different.  Maybe a cross between a Lowlander and a Hibiki.  I think the NAS versions are stil available, but I'd not be surprised if those don't live up to the aged version.  If you do see a bottle, pick it up...you won't be disappointed.  I remember paying 4 euros for this over two years ago, and a full bottle was only 50 euros.  If available even twice that much, I'd not hesitate to pick this up."
