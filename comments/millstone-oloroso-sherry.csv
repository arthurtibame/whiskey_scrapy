1.75,"Taste - Bity watery initially but develops to a fairly rich mouthfeel, light chocolate, some raisin, dusty young unprocessed grains, light spice similar to a spicy rye whisky

Finish - Lingering sweet raisins, bit harsh ethanol, return of the young unprocessed dusty grain

Score - 50/100

Final Thoughts - I guess without an age statement on this one this smells like a very young whisky. Interesting thing is that after a bit of air time, the raw young ethanol slowly fades away, but remains on the palate. Sherry influence on this one is present for sure, but is a bit bland with traces of chocolate and raisin. Sadly it's dominated by this young, raw dusty grain vibe and raw ethanol taste, like they included some of the heads & tails in this distillate or something.

Would I specifically order it? - No
