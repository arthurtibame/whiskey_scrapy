3.75,"For the price, ana amazing bourbon. Orange and spice on the nose, turns in to an orange zest bomb on the palate. Further notes of vanilla and oak come through. Finish is spicy and long lasting. The finish is definitely the best part of this whiskey which benefits from the higher rye levels of the mashbill. This is a fantastic bourbon for an old fashioned- the orange notes compliment the cocktail when made with orange rind."

3.5,"Drinking it neat, the rye spice is evident.  In following sips, the spice takes a back seat as vanilla gets on stage.  Rye spice returns to the finish, where gobsmacking cherry, orange, and vanilla notes swirl in to wrap it up. Then a pleasant, woody oak at the end. 

With a couple of teaspoons of water, the sweetness is diluted but lengthens into a lightly spicy finish.  When adding water, the finish is where the flavor is at.  It ends oak dry - as is typical of bourbons - but it keeps me smacking away at the oak, spice, and lingering sweetness.  


This is a budget bourbon that punches above it's price point.  And it can be found everywhere.  Yep, the juice is sourced from MGP and, sure, the bottle includes marketing nonsense about a long running family tradition.  But for bottling a great everyday sipper - Builleit knows what they are doing.

4.0,"Neat, from a tumbler: Cereal grains in the nose: more cereal barley than corn. Surprisingly little burn, more like metal shavings.

The burn does come through in the first sip, as does the corn. Some fruit rind and spiciness: cinnamon and clove. There is an inky saltiness on the lips; the rock salt actually comes through full force in the second wave. 

The finish is cinnamon spices, with a hint of pencil shavings. And that salt just don't quit. A tinge of finished wood but the salt and spices are the underground star of this one."

3.5,"This Famous Bourbon is nothing special, but fairly drinkable. 

Bottled at 45%abv with an amber color.

On the nose is your usual bourbon, vanilla, grapes, cola, cream, somo citric aroma like lemons, and cake notes. 

On the palate is Bitter and Hot mostly, with a strong oaky note not very pleasant, prunes and oranges and a short bitter finish a little harsh that burns your stomach.

Overall it is a 76 over 100. Better than some bourbons. Cheers"

2.75,"Lots of good reviews, so I’m bummed it's not better. Just a bourbon. Smooth, hint of cinnamon, orange zest. Tastes like an old fashioned when on ice.

Give the bottle time to open up and it’s pretty damn solid. 

I use the rating scale below. Distiller uses a scale of 5 and I use a scale of 10, but I’m sure you’re not too drunk to do the math! 

1. Disgusting - So bad I poured it out.
2. Poor - I wouldn't consume by choice.
3. Bad - Multiple flaws.
4. Below average - Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.
5. Good - Just average.
6. Very Good - Better than average.
7. Great - Well above average.
8. Excellent - In a league of its own.
9. Incredible - An all-time favorite.

3.0,"Nose: On the tip of the initial waft was a prominent  alcohol aroma no matter the distance from the glencairn, but that subsided after a brief moment revealing a sweet vanilla aroma clear to the back of the nasal cavity.

Palate: When tasting the Bulleit Bourbon the flavor of brown sugar was gentle and full-bodied. You would know it’s there but it’s not intimidating or overbearing. With a second tasting when swished throughout the mouth, this whiskey reveals a subtle chocolate flavor.

Finish: The soft glow of alcohol upon your tongue and a minimal gentle pepper were present for several moments after consumption."

Finalização: média, com apimentado, amargor e dulçor bem pronunciados.

Impressões gerais: um clássico Kentucky Straight Bourbon, bem balanceado e muito suave, sendo ele muito fácil de degustar (cuidado para não beber toda a garrafa de uma vez). O centeio fica muito evidente em todas os aspectos sensoriais, e faz toda a diferença na degustação. Um bourbon de muita qualidade e que pode ser degustado com uma pedra de gelo ou mesmo puro. O preço é muito atrativo (ainda mais considerando a sua ótima qualidade), podendo ser facilmente encontrado no Brasil em gôndolas de supermercados."

3.75,"In the past, I've mostly utilized Bulleit as a mixer in Manhattan's.  Have been enjoying neat for several weeks and finally reviewing in it's right.  Vanilla, cinnamon, oak and some sweetness make up the aroma.  Got a whiff of green apple as well. 
Flavor is caramel, oak and lots of baking spice with a sweet finish leading to light pepper.  The higher rye content seems evident in the spice notes. Enjoying more on it's own than I would have suspected.  A little water muted the aroma to mostly sweet caramel. Some orange peel notes come out in the flavor.  Glad I have made time to enjoy this a bit more."

3.25,"A good friend of mine was gifted three bottles of whisky for his birthday. A Japanese one, a Bulleit Bourbon and a Tomation Single Malt. As he wanted to share a few drams, we decided to keep a small tasting.

The Japanese Whisky - The blended White Oak Akashi Shin Select - wasn't impressive, but the Bulleit Bourbon upped our expectations.

While it reminded me a lot to the Jack Daniels Old number 7, I found it a bit softer, more likeable. The palate confirmed the initial nose of sweet cinnamon while adding some oak and butter. 
While I didn't found it actual comparable with a decent Scotch, I would mix JD with coke, but would rather enjoy this one neat."

2.5,"It smells a lot like bourbon - wood, vanilla, rye, caramel. The flavor is kind of mild (understated) but it is balanced and has some elements that stick out on their own. The flavors a re pretty traditional bourbon with some clear eye notes. It tends toward the sweet side with some tartness and plenty of spiciness. It's sippable without being outstanding, but that's impressive for such a cheap drink. I wish that there were less rye and the cinnamon is a bit too strong. Ultimately, it's barely sippable because of the rye presence, but the sweetness from the corn is a big help. It's not terribly complex, but it is nicely balanced with decent flavors and without being too weak from minerals.
It tastes a bit watery with some cinnamon and licorice sweetness. There's a disappointing, herbal, rubber backing. There's some nice caramel. The flavor is ultimately fine but disappointing, much like Evan Williams Black. It has a substantial amount of rye, but it adds to the rubber flavor when combined with the harsh cinnamon and licorice. Ultimately, it's fine, but not very good. I kind of prefer Evan Williams."
