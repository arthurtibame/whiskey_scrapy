4.25,"Simply outstanding stuff...a very distinctive flavor with notes of chocolate and dark fruits according to my palette.

I have six other Barrell products which are all excellent, but the 019 remains my favorite."
4.5,Solid vanilla and warmth on the nose. Clean finish with a smooth close.
4.75,"Taste:  Neat in Glen Cairn, 2 oz.  

Nose: (4.75) Fruit for days, like blackberries, ripe plums, all stewed in warm fresh churned butter.  It is an incredibly clean nose that was easy for me to discern.  There was a grapiness to this that was really interesting.

Palate: (4.75) Sweet, rich. best described as melted butter, grape jam, over warm homemade biscuits.  Some might find this too sweet.  I found it pleasantly digestif.

Finish (4.75) :  Long lasting and pleasantly warming.  Lingers and coats the back palate like sucking on a grape jolly rancher.  That butteriness gives a wonderful mouthfeel.

Overall:  Initially anything Barrell made me suspect.  Blending 9.5 and 12 year sourced Tennessee whiskey and sourced Kentucky bourbon seemed like a strange Frankenstien experiment to which I was not akin to investing $80.00 without trying first.  A work friend brought me a sample and man was he dead on on how good this is.  The quality is there and I definately now want a bottle .  I also am not afraid  to try Dovetail which is an experiment in Rye and Bourbon mixing. something that if done right (i.e. Forgiven,Bourye to name a few) is right in my wheelhouse.  Enjoy the jammy goodness with this one!"

4.0,"After last week’s damn good Barrell rum, I figured I’ll have a go at another Barrell product tonight—-this one also courtesy of @jonwilkinson7309.  

Barrell has really been hitting all strides. It has innovative products like Dovetail, higher end ones like their 25 yr old, and expansions into rum.  All done really well. But their core bread and butter is still the bourbon blends.  Apart from their 3 high end products, all of their lineup is priced around $90.  That places it square in the middle of most upper end whiskeys.  But I think what sets it apart is the consistent quality batch to batch.  And for me personally, I don’t find these too hot, as opposed to Booker’s, which I need to always overload with ice.  

A blend of 9.5 and 14 yr olds, from KY and TN, it’s a more of a high rye bourbon with a classic high proof taste and a slight barrel char.  The nose is the best part in this:  candied nuts and marshmallow.  

Another hit from Barrell.  If you’re a fan of classic old school bourbon, this has got to be on your list. 

Thanks Jon for the pour !"

4.5,"Barrell Batch 019 is a mix of whiskeys from Kentucky and Tennessee, ranging from 9.5 to 14 years in age.  Although not disclosed, George Dickel is alleged to be the Tennessee source.   It's bottled at 54.7% ABV.  

A deep caramel and molasses note is prominent on the nose.  The palate is dominated by wood spice, cinnamon, anise, pepper and clove.  Underneath is a very nice caramel and orange sweetness. The finish is long with vanilla and spice.  Barrell's web site identifies dark chocolate covered blueberries on the finish as well. While I would not have come up with that on my own, it rings very true.

I don't often experiment with adding water, but I did in this case.  A handful of drops toned down the cinnamon and spice a bit while increasing the vanilla and oak.  It also brought out a bit of fruit on then nose.  While Batch 019 is very nice straight out of the bottle,  I preferred it with just a bit of water - to my palate, it was a bit more balanced.

With or without water, this is simply a great bourbon, and a complex one at that.  I have no doubt I'll find more as I work through the bottle.  The complexity and relatively high ABV make it an engaging dram that demands to be consumed very mindfully.  But it's also an easy enough sipper that I could thoroughly enjoy it in a completely mindless fashion.  All in all, great stuff!"
