3.75,"I truly believe this is a good whisky, specially for the price. Some might say the 12yo one is better, some will say this one is. I gave the first one a 4.0 and this one 3.5 but only two points are dividing one from the other. (80 against this 78). 

Bottled at 40%abv, golden color.

On the nose is very similar to the taste. Its aroma is not complex but is nice. Almonds/nutmeg, red wine, orange cake,
Prunes. There is this dry fruits aroma, the hard dry fruits and the soft ones.
Fresh and fruity.

On the palate, Honey, Nutmeg, Butterscotch, Almonds and cereal. Creamy, from the grain whisky. Easy, very easy drinkable. The aftertaste is oaky and creamy with a light smoke.

Overall i give this dram a 78 over 80. It is very easy drinkable and should be at least a 4.0 but my scoring system, that has benefit a lot of whiskies in the past,  now it  goes the other way for this fine fair dram."
