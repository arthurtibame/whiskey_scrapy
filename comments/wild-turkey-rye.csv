2.0,Very light rye. Not really interesting but not bad either. Would use it as a mixer or on a very hot summer day.
4.0,Best cheaper Rye for an Old Fashioned. Why use a better rye for a cocktail? Drink the better ones straight.

3.0,"Rating closer to 3.5 than 3. It's not the 101 Rye, no, but as far as entry level straight ryes go, it's not bad: good balance of sweet and spice, fresh rye grain flavours and vanilla/caramel. Young and could use more proof, but as far as entry level straight ryes go it's a safe bet. Plays well in cocktails, too."

3.0,"Nose: Fruity sweet and something like an ale - it's almost more bourbon-like than rye.

Palate: Subtle sweet seed-spices (caraway, fennel, cinnamon, allspice) with a fudgey, sweet toffee character livened by a little pepper. Again, quite sweet and restrained for a rye.

Finish: Short and light.

This is by no means the most interesting rye available, but it is arguably the most acceptable cheap rye (at least in Australia where our choice is very limited) and it works well as a mixer. In that role it is a genuine alternative to blended whisky.

I enjoy it, but only as an everyday mixing dram and as not something to be sipped slowly and explored, but over an ice cube it is still a pleasant and gentle sipping rye. The low abv is what lets things down here - if this was at 43 or 45 % it would be a lot more interesting.  Reasonable value, but not a bargain.

“Above Average” : 3 stars"

3.25,"Nose is honey sweet rye, lightly toasted wood, and even cherries.

Taste is classic rye, heavy spice, sour fresh grain, pepper, and a bit of barrel char.

Finish is longer than expected for the proof."
3.5,Definitely rye-forward with some spices thrown in.  I would definite this rye as classic more than anything else.  Pleasant rye aftertaste but not too distinctive.  Can drink straight but would go well with a meat and cheese plate.

The palate is very light (to be expected at 81 Proof). It has rye with honey and vanilla.

The finish is medium-short. A lingering rye spice with slight tingling in the mouth.

Fairly easy to drink, but not a whole lot going on outside of rye. Not bad though."

It has a traditional spicey taste and smell and it mixes well with everything I have used it for. It makes a good but not great Old Fashioned and Manhatten. In this price point, it is my third favorite Rye with the first being Bullet Rye and the second being Jack Daniels Straight Rye. I have this in my bar when I have space for it."

4.25,"Great introduction to rye, yet still with a trick. Not too controversially herbal, but with a lot of heat and spice to handle."
3.5,"Nose: Classic rye - dill, oak, vanilla icing, cardamom, clove.  Apples.  Mint.  Very mellow.  Bready characteristics - imagine a marble rye bread with dill pickles and you're partially there.  Freshly mowed grass and barnyard characteristics.  Not the most complex nose ever, but definitely a rye whiskey.

Palate: Slightly muted.  Classic dill, cardamom, clove, nutmeg combo with barrel character coming through as vanilla icing, oak, and tannin.  There's that apple again - red delicious and honeycrisp come to mind.  Mint.  Finish is medium in length and mostly features more of an herbal, vegetal tint - that mowed lawn I mentioned is coming across again.  A little bright and shiny as it evolves, but not in an unappealing way.

Other notes: Like everything else from Wild Turkey, this is an excellent example of what it says on the label.  I wouldn't hesitate to suggest this to someone who wants to know what rye whiskey is all about.  In terms of flavors, I'd place this right in the middle of the pack - it's not one of those super boring bottles, but it's also not on the extreme end either (I'm looking at you, Spirit Works Cask Strength).  And the price point is excellent - WT has really mastered the art of punching well above their weight, and this is no exception."
