5.0,"Nose: peat, vanilla, caramel, hints of lightly smoking oak embers
Taste: sea salt caramel, very very nice
Finish: more of the sea salt, hint of smoked salmon
Overall: a very very nice dram. Reallyenjoyed the up front sea salt caramel on tasting.  Nose moves from peat to sugary oak.  Definitely worth a bottle"
4.0,"The nose is an immediate mix of sherry and peat, with smoke, straw, fig, cooked brown sugar and a hint of hazelnut and malt. The palate is peaty but balanced by the sherry notes, underlined by black pepper and spice. The finish is warm with peat that fades while the pepper lingers before giving way to orange oil."
4.0,"A delicious dram. The nose opens with peat smoke that fades quickly to reveal rich dark fruits, raisins, classic sherry notes. Maple, bacon fat, malt. The palate hits you with raisins and dark chocolate, brine, smoke, maple bacon, and finishing with iodine, leather, and cream."
4.75,Smokey and slightly peaty. Goes down smooth with a bit of heat to warm you up on a cold winters night.

4.0,"Date: 9/12/19

Region: Islay

Bottled at: 43%

Color: Amber (color added and chill filtered)

Nose: sweet smoke, sherry, cherry.  Some mocha.  Smoke not overwhelming and is well balanced.  After some time develops a malty sweetness/carmel.  

Palate: medium body.  Prominent sherry, some spice, grapes, dark fruits, fades to peat and smoke

Finish: medium long, smokiness to okay spice

Overall
Has mixed reviews but I really enjoyed it.  Well balanced and complex with mixed sherries flavors mingled with malty sweetness and smoke/peat undercurrent.  Would definitely buy another bottle.  However would be better if not artificially colored..."

4.0,"Representing island of islay
Nose: sea air, salt, sherry a lot like the classic laddie nose. Vanilla, toffe, (bourbon elements?!), melon, more smoke later on and peat with water
Body: light
Palate: coffee, smoke, light sweetness, but smoke predominates with water spice increased which I think is odd, maybe it’s the dinner I’m eating it with? Hint of vanilla with water
Finish: short to medium, peat
Note: delicious really good just short of amazing... if the sweat nose came through on the palate this would be amazing"

4.25,"Heavy sherry on the nose. Sweet raisins, oily, and heavy mouth feel on the opening. Sweet throughout, finishes with slight vanilla and some char entering.  Ends quickly but smooth throughout.  Very enjoyable."

3.75,"Upon first nose this seductive dram pulls you in with a soft tease of maritime peat and caramel, only to arrive at a deep, rich date note with a kiss of smoke on the finish. This is not a hard-puncher of a dram, rather a good old friend you can spend the day with. Cozy up."

4.25,"Tasted at a bar, in a flute glass.  Bottle level and age unknown.

Sherry influence heavy on the nose, with a campfire undertone.  Roasted trail mix over a campfire in October, with virgin dried fruit thrown into the mix.

The palate is more of the same, with the smoke and sweetness.  Sweet, dark fruits dominate the sweet side, while the smokiness never takes on a rubbery character.  Mouth-feel is medium, and ABV is low enough to be well-managed.  Some oak flavor comes through after 5-10 seconds.  The dried fruit and smoke never overpower each other, and ride the long finish together as friends."

4.5,"Campfire smoke, dark dried fruits, especially dried prunes. Strange but I feel feel iodine and salt... enjoyed it to the last sip. No alcohol punch. Really smooth and pleasant. Onne of the comments sad "" its like an old friend you can spend the whole day with.."" totally agreed"
4.0,Really tasty. Smooth. Not super complex.
3.75,"When i had the Bowmore 12, i was dissapointed. Everybody talks about how good Bowmore is, but 12 yo didn't live up to that expectation for me. I have now tried the 15yo Darkest and i have the feeling that it is better than the 12yo but lacks of some things to make it a great whisky.

Bottled at 43%abv it has a beautiful mahogany color. 

On the nose is Spectacular. Its aroma is one of the best i have perceived in a dram. Perfumed Peat, almonds, prunes and toffee in a beautiful way. 

I got excited about it and then when i tasted it, it brought me down. starts like water, to change into a nice Tobacco Flavor, then gets hot but not too much, a little bit oaky and malty. Light bodied, finish is medium with not much flavor on it. (nevertheless i just added 0.6 points to the score because i just felt more chewable tobacco while writting this, 5 minutes after i drank the whole thing). Nothing special here, no peat on the palate, it just doesn't feel that much ""Islay"".

I pour 2 drops of water on it. Other things appeared but not to change the score. On the nose: chocolate and some spices. On the palate: Ginger, bitter chocolate, caramel and more tobacco.

Now i have had 2 bowmore, not impressing me at all so far. The hype is not real, at least not yet. I have the 18 yo waiting, hope to find something better there. 76 over a 100; 3.75 if you prefer that score."
3.5,"Another delayed review that’s been sitting in my draft folder for a while. Since we’re all social-distancing and self-quarantining [no thanks to COVID-19], what better time to revisit and “dust off” some of my drafts for the Distiller community.

THE BACKDROP: Late August 2019 at JW Marriott Miami Turnberry Resort & Spa for a conference. Initially planned to extend my stay to max out a company-funded trip. My gf was flying in to meet up and explore Miami with me. All was good with the world. THEN...hurricane Dorian decided to crash the party. The ever-changing forecast at the time was that Dorian will hit Miami in 2 days. People were scrambling for the airports or to get out of town quicker than you could say prestidigitation (whatever the fuck that means).  To stay or not to stay? That is…was, the question. So, there I am on a windy Miami night, with a group of “brave” guys...& girls, trying to decide whether to call it and head home next day before the storm hits, while simultaneously trying to squeeze out some fun in anticipation of hurricane to come. It was clearly a time to try some good whiskey to calm the nerves. Enter Bowmore 15Yr The Darkest & JW Blue label (review coming soon). Not particularly super upper echelon drams but since I hadn’t tried neither before, they would do the trick (or so I hoped). The price per pour at the resort was ridiculous enough that I’m choosing not to remember it and not get upset. Sucks to be part of a captive audience with limited choices. Nonetheless, I’ll just say hurricane Dorian was NOT the only thing robbing us of our good spirits that evening (no pun intended). But...since it’s considered company “perks” [Read: Not coming out of my pocket], I’m not complaining too much...nuff said. Moving on.

NOSE: The nose is alluring. An aromatic orchestra of fruit, smoke and chocolaty caramel. I get cherries, buttered caramel and light sweet smoke, all playing their parts so well together. A little touch of brine at the tail end but not in your face aggressive like Talisker or Springbank.

PALATE: Taste doesn’t disappoint, mimicking the nose closely. Juicy fruit dipped in smoked liqueur. The smoke gently wafts in and out as if to tell you it’s also invited to party but wants to remain a stranger.

FINISH: Long and a bit dry. Smoke stays with you, cascading down your throat in a warming embrace.

CONCLUSH: Overall, a decently balanced and integrated dram, nose to tail (not another pun). I enjoyed this one. Solid 3.5 - 3.75 ⭐️.

Try, own or pass? Definitely try! I personally won’t be adding this to my collection because there are other similar styles with better VFM out there…AND...my whiskey-collection sieve is getting more and more selective as the world spins. Pass only if you don’t like the good things in life. Cheers my friends!"

3.0,"향 : 짙고 뿌연 스모키 x 2, 계속 맡게되는 중독성,  안개뒤로 숨어있는 옅은달콤함이 궁금함
맛 : 부들부들, 물같은 느낌, 살짝 열대과일이 스쳐지나감, 버번도 쉐리도 아닌 그 어딘가, 약간의 몰티함, 타바코스러움, 입안에서 많이 굴려도 부드러움
피니쉬 : 태운 장작의 스모키함이 오래 남음"
