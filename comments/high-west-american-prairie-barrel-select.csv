4.0,"Total Wine barrel selection. 51.1%
Cologne and dark fruit on the nose. Floral, tangy and intense flavor profile with medium oak. Medium to light mouthfeel, but full of flavor."
3.75,"Taste:  Neat 2 oz in glen cairn, fresh bottle.  This is Binny's barrel 12118 and bottle 173.  Finished 1yr 4 months in brandy cask.  Proof is 103.6

Nose (3.5):  Butterscotch candy dominates.  There is some lighter oak and ethanol that quickly gives way to red fruit.  It is not the most complex but just enough to be different.  Very straight forward and pleasing.

Palate: (4.0)  starts a bit sweeter with the brandy up front.  Reminds me of my grandma's candy bowl--- good memories of gold butterscotch candy and caramel creams.  Ripe red fruits  come in and then a peppery hit surprises.  Palate is more complex than the nose.  This is interesting.

Finish: (3.75) longer than I expected.  A bit drying.  Newer oak.  When the pepper and oak fade you get just a bit of honey to close it out.

Overall: This is interesting.  Combining what feels to me like a more rye foward whiskey with the sweetness and richness of brandy is a hit.  I like what is in this bottle!  For 39.99 it will make you ask-- why have we not finished whiskey in brandy casks like this more often?  It was on par with the newer releases of MWND ( post act 6) for me for half the price.  Not as full and rich but definately digestif.  If price were determining factor this is a 4.  I try to judge the juice but you cannot ignore what this is at its extremely low price point.  A single barrel finished pick for under 40???? You be the judge"

4.0,"Barrel 6115, bottled at 51.2%. Finished in ex-Rye cask for 1 year 7 months. Bottled for the NH state liquor commission.

Hugely aromatic with earthy spices: cumin, pepper, aniseed, but then sweeter molasses, syrup, and butter

Fairly gentle entry for the proof. Sweet banana bread, butter, brown sugar, clove, pepper. Long and warm finish with the sweet-hot chili flavors and bready sweetness hanging around."

4.5,"Neat, Midwinter's Night's Dram finished, Binny's release, barrel 7799, 100 proof

Nose is sweet and clean, vanilla, oak, citrus, dark fruit, rye.  Taste is honey sweet, vanilla, plum, cardamom, cinnamon, other rye spice with some oak tannins balancing it out what would normally be cloying.  Finish is medium with a little saccharine, dark fruit, oak tannins, and a little cocoa powder.

A nice sipper that's well balanced, especially considering a port barrel is involved.  The port barrel enhances rather than dominates.  Great example of a finished whiskey"

3.5,First pour has wheat notes and almost peaty after taste and nose. Smooth and balanced. Hard to consider as a true bourbon. Lighter tone and not quite caramel color. Leaves a sweet and sugary feel after a good sip
