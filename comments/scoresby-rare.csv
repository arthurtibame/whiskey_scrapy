2.0,"Somewhat boring and one dimensional, but it's a cheap Scotch I'm comfortable with putting in mixed drinks so I don't waste my good stuff. Mostly I like it because it's less sweet than bourbon and cheaper than rye."

1.5,It’s not good.
1.75,"I was with family over the weekend for a function and wound back at my sisters house. Perusing the closet, as I have done many times there, I pulled this Scoresby Rare bottle which was mostly finished. This was a bottle from my Grandfathers collection. I have never seen this ever (is that the Rare part?) So, taking what is left, I figured I would review, for posterity, and jump back to a time when the scotch that was imbibed from that generation was that of the blended kind. 

This is bottled at 43% and is a light golden color. 

This opens with a delicate sweetness. Vanilla, caramel and. butterscotch.  A bit more time and a fruity side appears.  That of Granny Smith apples, Dole  canned pears and a slice or two of apricots.

The body is medium light in weight.  There is a touch of sugary sweetness in the beginning and quickly fades.  It turns quite bitter of lemon zest, and slightly spicy with black pepper. 

What remains is the lemon zest bitterness and bar soap.  A touch of woodiness leaves the mouth feeling slightly dry. 

What was promising on the nose quickly fell apart in the palate and finish.  This is a whisky intended for mixing with a soda or ice.  Not one for a neat sip.  The off-putting soap is a deterrent for neat sipping.  All that said, it’s nice to take a small time warp back to those days for cheap, blended whisky.  [Tasted: 11/20/18][79/100]"
