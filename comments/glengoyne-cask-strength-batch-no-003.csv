2.0,"Full disclosure: I might be a hater, so feel free to discard this review. To my defense, however, I reviewed this whisky blind AND I generally really enjoy Glengoynes. This was a disappointing dram and none of the aromas or notes played nice together. 

There's a predominant cereal element on the nose, like oatmeal. Also honey, nuttiness and some fruit cake. The palate is peppery and long."
