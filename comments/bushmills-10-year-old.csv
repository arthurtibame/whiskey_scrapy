4.0,"The nose starts with predominantly green apples and pears, with maltiness and caramel, some metallic notes in the beginning. Later vanilla, milk chocolate, pickled ginger, peach, pineapple and even hints of darker fruits show up. Palate for this dram is marked by a sweet and sour note and bitterness perhaps a bit like orange peel. Maltiness is always present, along with a creamy texture. It finishes with some bitterness and leather, confirming the presence of sherry casks.

This is overall a solid dram for its value. A bit of water can deliver more fruity notes on the nose.

Revisited and found that the nose is absolutely beautiful, hence bumped up to 4.0 from previous 3.75!"

3.0,"Smells sweet - the sharpness of vanilla bean with a light honey backdrop; I immediately recognize the floral depth characteristic of an Irish; vanilla stays along in the palate, as well as candied apple and the filling of a cherry cordial - thoroughly malty as well; the finish is interesting and medicinal but diminishes sooner than I'd expect; thanks Mitch - an amazing gift and a great whiskey for the price range."

3.0,"While watching the NY Mets in game 5 vs the Dodgers, ordered a dram to ease the anxiety.  Ripe pears, vanilla and banana are the featured aromas. A hint of dried hay are found a bit deeper in the dram.  Spicy on arrival in that velvety Bushmills body.  That spice subsides and opens to sweetness of brown sugar, honey, milk chocolate whoppers.  The flavors do not stay for long  and give way to a slightly spicy cinnamon finish.  The mouth is left oaky dry and remains on the palate.  A good dram that is clean, neat and easy.  #LGM.

3.0,"Generously rounding this one up to three. The smell here is surprisingly evocative for 40% ABV, though not tremendously varied or complex: fairly intense sharp lemon rind, with mint, eucalyptus, bitter root vegetable (?), Wine Gum candies, and a backbone of candied banana/banana bread. Slight orchard fruit (pear, apple), hints of throat lozenge, some slight butterscotch as it sits in the glass. Taste is light but initially sharp, with some real heat. Once the fire recedes, however, there's frankly not a lot here--a very light malt that neither offends nor impresses. Hell, one might not even notice. Light mint, light lemon, light vanilla, lightly herbal--light, light, light. Faint banana, even fainter apple. Finish is almost non-existent, disappearing like that guy on Tinder who ghosted you. I can see why this whiskey is widely liked--because it in no way calls me to reflect on anything, ever (which I suppose can be a good quality). On the other hand, it's so mild it's basically an existential crisis in a glass. Nice enough with a beer back, but why bother when so many bottom-shelf options are just *as* nice with a beer back?"

3.0,"Deep amber in the glass. Nose:  vanilla, malt, bananas, nail polish (polish, not polish remover). Palate: not much here. A little more burn than expected at 40% ABV, and malt. A very grain-forward, cereal flavored dram. Finish is a little hot, a bit bitter, and very short. Forgotten almost immediately upon swallowing. 

As you can see, I'm not overly impressed with this bottle, which I picked up for St. Patrick's Day. I tried really hard to pick up aromas and flavors that, for me, just weren't there. I'm sure I could have done much better with a different Irish. The store I was in at the time didn't have Green or Yellow Spot, which is what I was looking for. I'm thinking this bottle is going to last me a while. 

I'd put this in the mid-to upper 70's for 3 stars."

Palate; very distinct oloroso sherry flavor which always reminds me of red candies like cherry nibs, red lollipops etc..Also something very similar to low level peat.  I get this very often in Irish whiskey, must be from the stills or the grain combination not sure.  A very deep intensity in the nose for something this inexpensive and aged 10 years.  Very good."

3.5,"info: On reconnait la plus ancienne distillerie (""officielle"") au monde par ses assemblage de blends et de single malt irlandais veilli principalement en fûts de bourbon américain et en fûts de chêne espagnol ayant contenu de Xérès. Les xérès sont des vins blancs produits à Jerez de la Frontera dans le sud de l'Andalousie en Espagne. Ces vins sont mutés à l'eau-de-vie pour obtenir deux grandes catégories : les finos pour lesquels est fait un ajout d'alcool à 15,5°, et les olorosos, à 18°. Ici, le Bushmills 10 ans qui nous intéresse est justement un jeu de fut de bourbon et d'oloroso. Autre particularité, cette distillerie effectue une triple distillation (habituellement double), ce qui procure un whisky plus léger. Plusieurs prix à son actif: cinq mention d'or (Single Malts - 2015 Wizards of Whisky Awards, Irish Whisky - Single Malt - 2014 International Wine & Spirit Competition, Irish Single Malt 12 Years and Under - 2014 World Whiskies Awards, Irish Single Malt - Premium - 2014 The Irish Whisky Masters, Single Malt Irish Whiskey - 2013 San Francisco World Spirits Competition), 2 mention d'argent (Irish Single Malt - Premium - 2013 The Irish Whisky Masters, Irish Whisky - Single Malt - 2013 International Wine & Spirit Competition) et deux bronze (Irish Whiskey - 2014 Wizards of Whisky Awards, Daily Dram - 2013 Malt Maniacs Awards). 

Nez: Vanille et pomme verte.

Bouche: De belles notes sucrés de vin de dessert. Des pommes et des kiwis. Une vanille crémeuse. Texture légère mais c'est normal avec la triple distillation.

Final: courte sur le miel et les agrumes.

Overall: Relativement simple mais efficace! On voit bien le côté irlandais de ce whisky: ça se boit bien! Le genre de whisky qui plaira aux débutants mais qui lassera rapidement ceux qui recherche davantage de complexité. Tout de même un très bon rapport qualité prix. Meilleur que l'original mais je préfère le Black Bush personnellement. 70%"

3.25,"This whiskey is quite light, even for an Irish whiskey. The unmalted barley notes don’t really come through until the finish. It is really easy to drink and is almost refreshing. There are some caramel notes in the finish and the unmalted barley notes remind you of a whole grain cereal of sorts. It’s a smooth whiskey and I’d use this whiskey to introduce someone to whiskey. Other than that I don’t think it’s anything terribly special. It’s floral and fruity and sweet, but you can find those things in a Speyside Scotch, but with a bigger punch of flavor."
3.25,"Very light and fruity at the nose with hidden notes of little smokiness. 
The first sip reveal the malt surpassingly spicy with a medium body a bit oily due to the triple distillation. Last taste of red fruits (grenadine) syrup and fresh mint."

3.25,"On the nose it has aromas of sweet vanilla, lemon zest, strawberry jam, shortbread cookies, baked apples and fresh banana bread with warm butter.
-
To the palate it tastes of honey, ripe pears, malted barley, vanilla, chocolate, and subtle oak.
-
In the finish it is very clean and fresh with subtle fruity sweetness, vanilla and a touch of spice.
—
With a drop of water, it remains sweet with a touch more citrus on the nose and spice to the palate.

This is a very pleasant, easy drinking, sweet and gentle whisky, as you would expect from an Irish Whiskey.  It smells fantastic!"
4.25,"For the price this is a LOVELY dram. It’s sweet, spicy, and super easy drinking for an Irish Whiskey. It has hints of chocolate and cinnamon that stand out amongst the rest. 

Would recommend to anyone looking for an amazing budget whiskey!"

3.5,"This one always throws me a little bit.  On the one hand it smells nice and has a pleasantly balanced flavor (moreso than most Irish whiskeys), and yet is a bit lacking in presence.  I actually really like everything about it, it just feels like the volume is turned down a touch too low.  This is bottled at 40%, and I suspect would benefit from a stronger ABV...maybe 45% or even a little higher.  Good, but could be better."

2.75,"This is one I've wanted to try for a while. Visiting family in Virginia and stopped in a small town ABC and saw it closed out for $26 so I bit. I recently was impressed by my first bottle of Black Bush, so my expectations going in were fairly high. Let's see if it meets them.

NOSE: Fairly Light. Cereal Grains & Apple Juice at first. With time it develops Sherry, Tea, Light Oak, and a heavy scent of Flowery Perfume.

NEAT: The first sip was almost effervescent. Light and Tingly with a healthy dose of Peppery Spice. Subsequent sips revealed it to be relatively Thin and Fruit Forward. Sweet Apple & Pear. Some Wood and Sherry notes. Bitter Finish with Sherry Notes lingering. Every tasting note listed you really had to work to find with the exception of the bitterness. It was front and center.

Splash: A little water really makes the Sherry Notes pop on the nose. Eliminates some of the bitterness, but makes the palate a one note Vanilla affair. 

VERDICT: This one was a disappointment from the opening of the way too thin and flimsy paper tube to the bitter (pun intended) ending. This did not taste like 10 year old whisky. I much prefer the Black Bush. Hell, even though it's been while since I've had it, I may even prefer the standard White Label. Glad that I bought this at a closeout price and not the regular $40+ that it normally sells for. It will not be a repeat buy."

4.5,"Nose: White chocolate, banana, herbal greenness (fresh spearmint, basil), a hint of sweet cream, creamy biscuits, some dark chocolate, white pepper, some spicy woodiness, some dark berry juice, plum juice, spicy chilli pepper, a hint of fresh ripe watermelon, fresh white peaches, peach marmalade, some barley sugar, some sunny seaside brine, hint of citrus peel and unripe green apple, small hint of sea side bonfire smoke and barrel char, spicy pear apricot and peach

Palate: A medley of ripe orchard fruit (peach, apricot, nectarine, pear), some candied green apple, sweet cream, white pepper spice, a savoury chilli pepper, spicy wood, oak spice, sweet chocolate syrup, peach nectar, a hint of vanilla extract, a little candied orange, some candied lemon peel

Finish: Fruit peels, hint of white pepper and wood spice, some lemon peel, hint of sweet cream, hint of herbal greenness (spearmint and basil)"
2.5,"Nose: Apples! Red apples! Many, many red apples! Juicy pears, fresh, crushed, cider, perry, cider vinegar. One of the most orchard-like of whiskey noses. Some vanilla and a little honey in the background. With time even more fruity notes appear, but nothing citrus. Adding a dash of water mutes the fruit and allows floral notes to bloom and take over the nose.

Palate: Sweet and silky at first then a little spiciness shows up along with some polite cinnamon. Cereal flavours emerge in the development but it remains a resolutely light and fruity dram. It gains more sweetness as it opens but the texture is thin and watery and some bitter weak tea-like tannins show up towards the finish. Adding water softens the palate and subdues the bitter tinge.

Finish: Medium/short. The cereal notes outlast the fruitiness and the aftertaste is slightly dry and veering towards bitter. There is something reminiscent of a light white wine about the palate. Adding water shortens the finish.

An OK Irish single malt that is not going to launch 1000 ships, but may just float a coracle. Pretty much the exemplar for a summary rating of ""Average"", which it only just reaches. It's somehow narrow and constrained and does not really taste like 10 years old - at least not in comparison to almost any Scottish 10 year old single malt.

As a mixer it's friendly but a little too modest - it adds a soft fruity note but not much more. At the price it's not what I'd call great value unless you prize easy-drinking simplicity above all else.

""Average"" : 2.5 stars"
3.75,"Smooth and sweet sipping whiskey. Nose: strong tropical fruits, some minty notes and vanilla. Palate: fresh, vanilla and caramel (chocolate?) sweetness. Warming spices. Aftertaste: sweet then gentle spiceyness coming. Medium length."

4.0,"When I first opened and tried this dram I was a little disappointed. It had a pleasant honey-malt-ripe pear nose. It tasted of those as well, and a little heat on the finish followed by an unpleasant bitterness. Overall it was a little thin in the mouth, compared to nearly any single malt Scotch. I guess I should have expected that. The famous Irish triple distillation ""for smoothness"" will remove most of the fatty amino acids, etc. that will give body and additional flavor notes to the malt. (Charcoal mellowing in Tennessee whiskey does the same thing.) HOWEVER, after allowing the whisky to breathe in the glass several minutes, or the once opened bottle to rest a few days the dram became a much more pleasant experience. A sweet honey note to the malt was much more distinct now and the bitter note on the finish is gone. This is quite similar to a malty Scotch with no peat or sherry, although thinner in the mouth than most Scotchs."

4.0,"Sometimes simple is good. Simple is successful. This is the case of bushmills 10yo, one of the most sold irish whiskies ever. The only Bushmills i have had before was the ""original"" and i didn't liked it. This one is different, it doesn't even give you that ""grain whiskey profile"". It is a very straightforward dram, but gets the job done.

Bottled at 40%abv.

On the nose, only to notes: blackberry juice and berries. Actually very perfumed.

On the palate: plum and lots of cream from the grain whiskey that is inside the blend, in a very lovely way. 

Aftertaste is spicy, clove and pepper. 

Overall i give this fine and super cheap dram an 83 over 100 and now i know why it is a blockbuster."

3.75,"I opened the bottle a while back and the nose is just brimming with ripe pear. There is vanilla hiding behind it with some other sweeter notes.
The taste is quite light and friendly, you would expect to find a lot of pear in it as the nose seems to promise but I can't get that much.
Aftertaste turns quite spicy and long with hints of the sherry.
I quite enjoy this and it is my first real foray into Irish whisky.
By the way, in coffee it is fantastic!"

3.25,"On the banks of the River Bush, there used to be a watermill, hence the name 'Bushmills'. Licensed in 1608, it's one of the oldest distilleries in the world. Light and engaging, the nose of this triple distilled Single Malt combines sour peach, orange peel and mild spices with delicate notes of chive and thyme. Remarkably solid for 40% ABV, the palate is fruity, malty sweet and well-balanced. Banana, pears and a touch of menthol are rounded off by pleasant hints of oak. Lime, fresh mint and some bitter tannins mark the short finish. The Irish Glenfiddich?
