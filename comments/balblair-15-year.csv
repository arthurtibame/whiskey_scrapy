3.25,It’s a good whisky but nothing special. Honey and malty notes with a medium finish
3.5,"Nose a bit closed and boozy, in mouth very boozy and boring at first, open amazingly with a few drops of water. Floral, spicey, quite complex and nice"
4.0,"This whisky was only finished in ex-Sherry casks, and maybe it's because they are first filling, but on the nose you can feel them a lot: ripe fruit in profusion with peaches, plums and red fruits, nutmeg and a marked balsamic accent, sweet and fresh at the same time. Almost like a tart. Wood chips in the background.
And the fruit remains queen also on the palate, a warm and dense scent of jam that permeates the mouth, with a touch of caramel and a light alcoholic puncture. Raisins, black cherries, red apple. Very full, on the threshold of tiredness. Still wood in counterpoint, with a touch of almond.
The finish is quite long, dry and slightly acidic, of wood and candied fruit.
A fruity bomb which, as such, can be very pleasing or completely repulsive. It is not a pimp, of course, but the sherried influence is perhaps a little invasive, at the expense of balance."
