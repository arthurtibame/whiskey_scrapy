3.0,Its high abv gives it a nice edge on its cousin Baby Blue. A good choice if you are into corn whiskey.

4.0,"This True Blue Cask Strength (68.3%) required a bit of water. It smells of pancake syrup and oak. The taste is of vanilla, toasted marshmallows and some spice from the wood at the end. The vanilla lingers in the finish."

4.0,"Purchased 12/28/17 at Balcones. 68.3%. Light and smooth at first, then caramel and corn sweetness opens. Responds well to a bit of water. Simple yet still a good corn whiskey. Very dark color (Texas heat and small casks). Paid $75 (can't find cask strength locally). Tastes of vanilla, caramel, slight hazelnut aftertaste."

5.0,"Long day, many miles on the road, so I'm not really in the mood for a scotch. Today, we got corn. Blue corn. And a very nice ABV of 61.2. My first cask strength if I remember correctly. Let's jump right into it. On the nose there is a dominant note of vanilla, some barrel spices with cinnamon and grilled peaches. Interesting smell, kinda makes you want to dive right into the glas. And you should. You are greeted with a lot of toasted brown sugar, below that some light caramel notes, typical vanilla and cinnamon spicyness, the grilled peaches from the smell make an appearance on the taste too. Rather on the spicy side, although I suspect that might have to do with the proof. But no unpleasent burn. The sweet and spicy aftertaste lingers for quite a while. Not too sweet, not too spicy. Kinda like dark chocolate with chilli. I still have the 100 proof for cross testing. That comes tomorrow. So far, I like what Balcones offers."

3.0,"Odd start neat. Like its unfinished, strong. Not pleasant. With water its a nice sipper. Fail as a cask strength"

4.0,"This is a good whiskey. Drinks a hell of a lot smoother than the proof. Lots of oak, vanilla, spices and dark fruit on the finish. So chewy"

4.5,"Color: rust

Aroma: corn forward with some malt and floral sweetness that leads into slight cabernet scents

Taste: pop! there is a warm sweet corn hit but then it mellows into a cream corn and sweet vanilla cream flavor. 

Finish: though the cask strength hasn’t shown up yet, it makes itself known on the finish. If drinking neat, it screams of cinnamon spicy heat. 

Adding a bit of water opens up the sweetness and chills the heat a little buy does not destroy the flavor profile. And at 64.7% ABV, a little water can’t hurt, amirite.

Smooth factor: lol"

4.25,Powerful taste! Rich buttery sweet vanilla and oak in a potent Texas corn whisky.

2.5,Very peanut brittle. Not a huge fan of peanut brittle.
4.0,"There is corn in this. You can taste the sweet and the savory at the same time. The strong charred oak character steals the show, revealing cinnamon spice. It’s oily and rich and the finish is strong. Someone said peanut brittle is in the finish and I agree. Someone else said it’s fruity and winey and I don’t agree."
