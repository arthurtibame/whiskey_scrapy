3.0,A Alidi special in Australia it is in the $99 mark for a 30 year old is a absolute Bargain but does the taste deliver? Considering this blends consist of 30 -50 whiskies of each at least 30 years it is definitely one to try and determine how they pull it off! Overall a smooth and pleasant Whisky!
