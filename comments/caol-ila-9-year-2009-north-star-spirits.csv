3.75,"North Star Spirits tasting event, Sydney, February 21, 2020, Whisky #6

Nose: To begin with the nose is dominated by sweet peat-reek. It’s fruity with slight berry notes, stone fruits, and distinct lemon zest. Earthy and dusty oak notes and some spicy hints follow. As it sits and rests the smoke gains a thick, oily industrial quality.

Palate: Sweet fruity smoke on the arrival with ginger, licorice and tamarind spices. The development sees citrus notes (lemon and grapefruit) flood the initial sweetness before the cask influence resurfaces with perfect timing to provide a sweet creamy balance. Adding water intensifies the citrus but is not required, as the whisky is not at all hot. The texture is slightly oily, but dry.

Finish: Medium/long. Sweet citrus/sherry notes and some brine fading into smoke.

A good whisky that is vibrant but balanced and provides a perfect showcase for both Caol Ila distillate and the art of adroit PX cask maturation. The cask is very subtle here and never intrudes as a simple sherry sweetness, but instead provides a balancing quality to modulate the dry, briny and bright lemony smoke. The main bourbon maturation worked to perfection and the whisky was finished for the optimal time.

There’s not much more to say – this is simply very good young Caol Ila and well recommended. The only thing worth adding is that this is not alone in being a great young Caol Ila - the distillery sells on contract to dozens of IBs and there are many stunning 10 year old or younger Caol Ilas out there, many with interesting finishes.

“Good, just a shave below Very Good” : 3.75 stars"
