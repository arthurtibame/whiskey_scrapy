3.5,"I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was. I really like what this distillery is doing for a NAS expression bottled at 50% for this price , great job. The 14 year is awesome and this is a great one as well. The nose is milk chocolate with some brine and the taste is full buttery with  a twinge of pepper , fruit and bit sour at the end. Great dram."

This Madeira is another good drop, you get the sweetness but as PBM noted the salt which makes an interesting and enjoyable combination. This is a dram that goes down very easily and has a satisfying bite and flavour to the aftertaste which has a slight bitterness (or maybe that's the salt). 4 I'm pegging this one at."

A sweet under-current hides on a layer of salinity and brine.  Sort of like having s'mores on the beach, really close to the seawater.   The Islander salinity and Portuguese Madeira seems like a happy marriage.  Mine was just a sample I had bought, but now I'm wishing I got the full bottle."
