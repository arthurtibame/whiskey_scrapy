4.0,"LW Barrel pick: Preference to 6, 4 & 1

6 got better and better"
3.5,"A young spicy rye. A little bit of oak, but not very much. Black pepper, baking spice, and leather up front. A little hint of sweet, then a short punchy finish. Not bad, but honestly much better rye out there in the price range."

4.0,"The aroma has notes of Vanilla, oak, and allspice, subtle hints of cinnamon. Upon tasting, the bourbon has a velvet mouth feel. Hints of vanilla, nuttiness, caramel, an almost s'mores tase, and an oaky afterbirth finish. For a mashbill with 36% rye, this bourbon is extremely well balanced with no spiciness we relate to rye whiskeys. An absolute treat."
