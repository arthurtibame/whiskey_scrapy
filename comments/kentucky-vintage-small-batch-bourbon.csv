null,A bit of smoke at the finish. Reminds me of some scotches. Nice flavor up front so I would drink again. Very smooth and drinkable neat.
1.0,Really not worth trying. One of the very few bourbons I ever poured down the drain. Had a very nasty chalkyness to it.

3.0,"This cheaper Bourbon is sourced @ bottled by the same folks who source Willet.    It's ok for what it is.

But for cheap bourbon I like Very Old Barton better."

2.0,"I really enjoy most KBD juice and all iterations....except this one. It's drinkable, but there's something in the flavor profile that's off-putting to my taste buds and nose. Out of balance flavors. Feels hotter than 90 proof.  Probably won't buy again. Will finish the bottle."

3.0,Not terrible. Smooth and sweet but not a great aftertaste. Not sure on price as it was a gift.

1.0,Ordered Vintage 17 at a bar once and was served this. There are a few small differences between the two. Mostly that this is fairly terrible and V17 causes the clouds to part.

3.25,Excellent everyday bourbon for mixing
3.5,"Without an ice cube, this is more like a 3.0. However, with a cube, this becomes a 3.5 and to my palate, tastes similar to Weller Reserve. Best budget buy right now when you can't find Weller. Pure Kentucky is very similar, and some like it more. The only negative is sometimes I get an aftertaste of sweet and low, but not always."
3.75,"smokey and oaky this is a solid everyday bourbon at its price point. Nose hints at caramel, corn, rye, its simple and straight forward, buttery and smooth on the palate. long smoke and oak finish."
4.0,"A customer recommended for my wheat taste, I'm very pleased"
2.5,Heavy on the sweet side; from a smokey apple and citrusy point of view.

3.5,Been wanting to try the cheaper willet brands that have come out. For sure not as full flavored as their nicer stuff but great for the lower price point.

4.0,Sweet in the finish. Bold and spicy at the beginning. A little water or cube will bring out the limestone water and sweetness in the end. Really good all around. Almost Canadian in a sense but definitely bourbon

2.25,"Professional reviewer understates the bitter wood flavor, overpowers the better flavors in this bourbon. Not the worst I’ve tasted, prefer to mix this one."

2.75,Floral. Chocolate. Cinnamon. Just a little young.
3.0,Peaches on the nose. Heavy and smoky burnt sugar in the mouth with a warmth that lingers.

3.0,"Cinnamon stick, Cinnamon red hots, oh and Cinnamon!  

Feels and taste more of a 110 proof vs the 90 that’s stated.  Great mouth feel and a tad on the oily side.  Decent finish with a spicy, slightly smoke and wood finish Picked this up by chance for a mere $29 in Myrtle beach.  Over all a decent bargain whiskey, especially if your into cumin?, coriander? clove? .........oh wait CINNAMON!"

3.0,"Much heavier tobacco nose than anything else I have, I think. Lots of hay and peppery rye on the palate. Quite thin and light in color. Not great, but very drinkable!"
