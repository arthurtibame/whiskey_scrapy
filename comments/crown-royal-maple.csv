Nose resembles maple syrup on buttered pancakes, but the false maple flavoring after a sip is closer to ""maple"" bacon. For those folks at Crown Royal listening, maple bacon Crown would be the next perfect blend. Hop to it!"

It's good straight out of the bottle, over ice, or my favourite, with baileys( take 1 giant ice cube, add 60ml of maple whiskey, top with 30ml of baileys, and sink into pancakey heaven). I live in Australia so it's a little expensive, and hard to find. Well worth it tho."

As many have said it makes a very good mixer for all kinds of new ideas but on it's own you gotta be in the mood for it.  It's great in cola, still haven't tried it with a splash of water... Yeah that's all I got so far..."

3.0,"A good beginner's whiskey. The maple is actually a good addition to the typical Crown Royal flavor profile, which already has a hint of maple to it. When you nose this one, of course you get that maple note immediately, but on the palate it is an enhancement. It helps to take the edge off of a whiskey which tends to have a dry aftertaste. This is a good, cold day, easy-to-approach drink."

I think the next Crown Royal should be aged in staves constructed by laminating hockey-stick-grade plywood and flavored with hockey puck shavings.  It might taste better than this.  What they did here was take stock substandard even for the standard Crown Royal, and add cheap maple syrup to it.  I couldn’t smell it much, thankfully – bartender poured it into a tumbler.  It tastes like maple syrup and butterscotch.  Acetone cheap grain alcohol.  Subtle hints of whiskey.  Very fleeting.  The finish is missing some insulin.  This is undrinkable; but I drank it, because I love my country.  Wayne Gretzky pours this over his waffles.  0/100."

You get a little bit of oak in the back and some leather like smell but mostly maple and taste is just the same....MAPLE SYRUP right up front, very sweet and not much after that. Has some spice from  what I would assume would be the oak. It’s not bad but it’s not an everyday Whisky due to how sweet it is but it might be considered a good dessert Whisky."
