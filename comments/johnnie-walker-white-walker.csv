3.0,"Picked this up earlier this afternoon as I’m a massive GoT fan. I tried it room temp then put into freezer to see the “change” happen to the labeling. The bottle recommends to freeze it to enjoy the flavor while it warms. Bleh. Alright I’ll try your method..
    
    Now, onto the whisky. As with any whisky in my personal opinion I’ve always enjoyed it more when room temp vs ice or putting it in the freezer. I had low expectations given the price point ($32 at my shop). That being said I was a little surprised that I enjoyed it room temp at all. The cold reduces the blend to something you could take gulps of which is not a positive, let’s be honest. 
    
    When warm the nose reminds me of an Irish. Light honey with some peppery notes. The palate is vanilla, orange zest, and berries. Finish is short to medium in length.
    
    Overall I stand by this is a surprisingly good whisky for $32 a bottle. I suspect more Clynelish is in this blend then I figured would be and I believe it carries this whisky on its back. While I do enjoy the flavor profile the volume knob is turned down to a 4/11 which for some people is perfect. That person just isn’t me. I will enjoy sharing this on the final season premier when that day comes.

3.0,"Label is no-where near as blue as the picture will lead you to believe, but no need to judge a book by its cover, expect a pretty standard whisky. Slightly less peaty than Red or Black, but still balanced all around, very reminiscent of other JW expressions. #YouKnowNothingJonSnow"
2.0,"Sweet. Flavor dumbed down to make it appealing to a mass audience. 

I’m assuming they were targeting all of the GOT fans that have limited their drinking to sweet cocktails. The gimmick of storing the whisky in the freezer probably was to help those people take it down easier, as drinking a whisky neat is normally too harsh on their palettes. Unfortunately for the rest of us, the flavor will be odd. 

Sadly, the most enjoyable aspect of this whisky is the bottle."

1.0,"Nose - (room temp) Sweet grain vodka, hints of melons & berries, light vanilla caramel (chilled) very subtle, light vanilla scented grain vodka.

Taste - (room temp) Overly sweet splenda sweet, apple juice, wet hay, light artificially sweetened & flavored vanilla frosting, light young oak bitterness (chilled) no change

Finish - (room temp) Lingering medicinal splenda sweetness, light fruity bitterness, hint of melon rinds (chilled) no change

Score - 11/100

Final Thoughts - Marketing at its finest. I'm sure some people might like/appreciate this, but holy crap. This tastes like super young vanilla flavored potato/oat vodka. The color is super light, making me think I'm not far from the truth. The initial taste reminds me of High West's Silver Oat Whiskey, which is a barely aged oat whiskey. The chilling just mutes the unpleasant nose a bit but otherwise doesn't change the flavor profile much. This is pure gimmick from Diageo and they got me to bite w/ the fancy plastic shrinkwrapped bottle & Game of Thrones theme.

Would I drink it if offered? - NO

Would I specifically order it? - NO

Would I buy a bottle? - Sadly I already did, but mainly for the bottle"

5.0,Surprised to say the least. Black label is a go too for me for the money. This is as tasty to me. IMO.  Was a little worried I was getting re-packaged red label at a more expensive price.  It’s completely different. Give it a try.  And the bottles cool too. So that’s a plus.
3.0,"I give this a 3.75. The aroma is caramelized brown sugar and the palate is sweet fruit apple with a touch of smoke. I expected this to be bad, but it’s pretty good. My only complaint is that it has a thicker viscosity than normal and it’s a lower proof than I care for."

2.0,"I had a pour of this, courtesy of a local wine shop’s free tasting event.  Out of the JWs I’ve had (black, green, island green, blue), this is probably my worst.  Served chilled, over ice, it was flavors of red berry water, a bit sweet and thin.  Nose is similar....red fruits, especially berries.  It’s not bad considering the price ($30), and it’s clearly driven by an exec sitting in a suit and tie, looking at partnership revenues from HBO and Diageo.  But, with that said, I really do feel it’ll end up being a collector’s item.  Yes...I bought a bottle, not with the intent of drinking it...it’s piss water with a hint of raspberry...but with the sole purpose of collecting as a die-hard GoT fan.  In that sense, I’m sure Diageo’s goal is accomplished....a person like me ( $30 is not breaking the bank, a huge GoT fan, and likes whiskey) is in their core market.  If this didn’t have the White Walker GoT branding, would I have bought a bottle, or even tried a pour? HELL NO.   I’ll probably end up getting all, but honestly gotta say the only two I’m interested in drinking are Lag and Talisker.  Others will just sit there and look pretty, but quite empty in taste."

3.0,"I've apparently got a gift for getting into the Next Big Thing just a few months before it goes big. ""Dizzy Up The Girl"" by the Goo Goo Dolls? Totally listening to it before everybody else in high school went crazy over it. Malbec? Discovered it during my year in South America; came back to the US and suddenly everybody was all over this exotic new red from Argentina. Game of Thrones? Read the books in the interim between seminary and starting at my first parish, mostly on the Blue Line traveling back and forth between my place in Logan Square and my now-wife's in Forest Park...right before everybody and their uncle started watching the show.
    
    At any rate, read the books and watched the show I have done...and now, I'm buying the whisky. This is the first bottle from the limited edition GoT series that Diageo is releasing this fall. I'll confess to some reservations about what to expect; this mostly seems like a chance to cash in on the last season of a popular tv series. I'm sure that was the primary motivator, but Diageo being what they are, I was hopeful that the whiskey would at least be worthwhile.
    
    This initial bottling is...worthwhile, if not life-changing. I followed the counsel to freeze the bottle, but poured myself a room temp nip, too, to compare. At room temperature, there's none of the Johnnie Walker touch of peat smoke that makes me enjoy the Black Label; it's a pretty one-note sweet vanilla affair with a tiny hint of barrel spice and citrus. Reminds me more of Dewar's than JW. Unexpectedly, there was more going on for me when the dram was cold - unctuous texture, poached pear on the nose and palate, a little spice, and creamy vanilla. As the dram warmed, the pear notes lessened and the vanilla increased. The mouthfeel, too, shifts from thick and coating to a lighter, but still round and full.
    
    I wish there were some more complexity to be found here, but this is solid whisky...and a fun way to kick off the series. Winter is coming."

1.5,"So I love Game of Thrones (come on GRRM and finish Winds of Winter already!!) and I am trying to land all of the recent bottles released by Diageo to celebrate the upcoming final season. Michigan hasn’t released anything yet except this bottle from Johnnie Walker. Bottled at a strange 41.7% ABV, chill filtered and has colorant added making it a golden straw color. Among the unnamed grain components, Cardhu and Clynelish are named on the bottle as being the malt components. White Walker is recommended to be consumed straight out of the freezer (when the message “Winter is Here” appears on the bottle) so that’s where I started. 

Nose from the freezer: strong green grapes and green apples, lemons, oranges. Weak oak and vanilla, strong grain alcohol notes. Not much to detect, but what’s there is not good. 

Palate from the freezer: harsh grain alcohol, bitter. Some malty notes, sour oak. Spicy ginger or turmeric, coconut and vanilla. Really, really horrible stuff. 

At this point I could drink no more so I let it sit a while to warm up to room temperature. Here’s what I found. 

Nose at room temp: coconut, light oak and cinnamon, ginger. Almonds, cherries and orange oil. Very malty/yeasty, herbal, floral and grassy. Strong candle wax, the Clynelish component is really prominent, but always overshadowed by the young, harsh grain alcohol. A bit buttery and more oranges. 

Palate at room temp: strong grain alcohol. Light citrus- orange and lemon. Light oak, coconut, ginger, almonds and pepper. Malty biscuits, fairly waxy. Much better than when cold, but still subpar. 

A light bodied mouthfeel that is creamy, oily and mouthwatering. 
The finish is medium length with grain harshness, coconut, vanilla, waxy, oak and pepper. 

Well, I wasn’t expecting to be drinking Black Label when I picked up this bottle, but I also wasn’t expecting to be smacked with something worse than Red Label either. At least Red Label has some smoke to it to make things a little interesting. No smoke to be found here. Out of the freezer this is undrinkable garbage (and that’s how they recommend it!). At room temperature it’s ok, but would never be something I reach for, ever. I can say that it is well hidden in Coke/Pepsi, but at $42 that’s far too much for a mixer. At room temp I score this as a 2.25, but out of the freezer it’s a 1(and I think that’s being generous). So taking the average brings this to a 1.5. Avoid this unless you plan to never open it and just use it as a decoration. 
Cheers"

1.5,"Nose: Grain whisky with some light fruit and berry notes and a little bit of vanilla toffee, but it’s all rather thin and spirity. It reminds me of the nose on Red Label but with more sweetness.

Palate: Disarmingly sweet, soft and easy right through the tasting. Notes of toffee, brown sugar, vanilla, and some stewed berries. There is no real arrival, development or finish to speak of – it just appears and then hangs about for a while without changing.

Finish: Medium/short.

I promised myself that I'd ignore everything to do with Diageo’s GoT tie-in whiskies, however at the liquor store today they were giving away tastings of this stuff so … what the hell.

It is, obviously, a mass-market sipping blend specifically engineered to appeal to those who normally don't drink whisky neat, or maybe at all. At room temperature it is *very* sweet, which is of course intentional so that when it is served from the freezer (as per the marketing advice) it will still have flavour.  I imagine it would also gain some density of texture that way.

Diageo say it contains Cardhu and Clynelish, but I couldn’t detect any trace of Clynelish.  It seemed to be mostly Cardhu and grain whisky.  It’s not unpleasant, but rather banal and little more than a novelty. I'm amazed it isn't being packaged together with a bobble-head white walker for Christmas.

If you like your whisky to have depth, breadth and an interesting character to explore then leave this on the shelf and look elsewhere.

2.0,"Well, Game of Thrones final season is upon us.  Diageo has released a bunch of whisky themed around the houses of Westeros and Johnnie Walker created a blend suitable for the dead to drink (whoa, that’s a spoiler for this review).  This is that blend:  Johnnie Walker White Walker.  It’s bottled in a freezer-ready package that reveals a special message when it gets cold enough and they want you to drink it straight from the freezer- tell me that doesn’t speak volumes...

Anyway, I had started to jot a bunch of jokes down and I fully intended to write a humorous review for this whisky, but I ran out of enough ideas and laughs to make myself happy, so I ditched that idea and decided to just write a typical review.  Here goes...

White Walker is blended and bottled at 41.7% ABV and it’s straw yellow in the plastic cup I figured was worthy enough to drink this stuff out of.  There was big, watery drops and legs and a nice oil slick around the cup, too.  All of my review is from a sample from my buddy Paul, and it was only done at room temp- I don’t want to drink it from the freezer.

The nose struck me quickly with a spearmint gum note with a little floral, barnyard note (like wet hay).  There was no barrel presence and no hint of ABV.  I didn’t feel the need to let it rest- I just went for it.

The palate was waxy as hell, like Clynelish, with some light apples and pears.  Faint citrus arrived mid sip and ushered in the minty chill they were obviously going for.  It’s refreshing, albeit lacking in any kind of depth.  It would probably add some dimension to a citrus or mint based cocktail, for sure.  The mouth coat was oily and a little thick.

The finish was grainy, but relatively smooth.  There is zero complexity, but then again that could be said for almost every Johnnie Walker (at least the low range stuff).  The finish was short, but refreshing, I guess.

It’s not nearly as bad as I was lead to believe.  I have 2 bottles of this stuff to complete 2 full Diageo Game of Thrones sets so there’s no need to open them now.  Thanks for that, Paul.  But, I wouldn’t want to drink much more of this anyway to be honest.  Use it at GoT parties for a mixer or, hell, freeze the bottle and turn it into a drinking game during the final season.  Every time Bran stares blankly into the camera someone has to chug until the scene changes- wow, that’ll get ya ripped haha.  I can muster 2 stars for this with hopes the bottle helps inflate the value of the GoT whisky set long after the series is over.  Fingers frozen and crossed.  Winter is here!  Cheers."

1.75,"I like all things JW, but let’s be honest, this is junk...I’m ok with the bottle sitting on my shelf, but wouldn’t dare serve it to anyone again. The reason they want you to freeze it, it to hopefully mask the flavored, colored mix inside. Like, even if they had just put JW Black in there, everyone would have still stepped up to buy it, but having such a junk liquid was a real shame"

4.0,"Delightfully smooth, but MUST be placed in freezer (as directed on the bottle) for desired taste. as the other tasters have not noted, the bottle specifically tells you to place in the freezer. This involves a completely different taste and texture, in which is very unique for a cheap bottle of scotch, but consider it more of a mixed drink more than anything"

Comment faire de l'argent!
On commence lentement cette dégustation mythique en se promenant avec les white walkers. Rien de bien intéressant pour cette bouteille, mis à part l'étiquette et la référence à la série TV. Ne passez pas go, ne réclamez pas 200$"
2.5,"This whole dram yearns to be better but falls shorter than our expectations for the last season...

Nose is sweet and malty implying a hopefully round white fruit sweet palate. Palate is still sweet but lacks depth one wishes for. You want more and hope finsh deliver. The caramel and light fruity and slight malt return but fade quicker than your hopes of Cersei dying by Jon Snows hand...

Cool bottle, when drank cold more bready/malty sweetness comes out...basically the Bud of blend SM scotch. Bottle was best part. Diageo gets a 10 on marketing. Their product gets a 2.5. Well played. Awesome bottle."

It would be a nice collectible but how does it taste? It was really awful. I could not finish my dram. After a couple of sips, it was a drain pour and now that drain hates me like Gollum hates Bilbo. Forever! I hope Diageo is making this for the suckers to fund really good and affordable Talisker! I am starting a SpartaTodd rule that the graphics and bottle design is inversely proportional to the quality of the juice inside. If the goal was to make a whisky that matched Season 8 GoT then... SUCCESS!"

1.75,"I must admit. This doesn’t suck. Mind you it’s still not good whisky, but it isn’t irredeemable. 

This was a leftover from a tasting kit I got months ago for my birthday. I wasn’t in a hurry to try it, but I’m making room for better stuff in my cabinet. I did stick it in the freezer for a while as the bottle suggests. 

Definitely young grain whisky on the nose, but the cold ramps down some of the more metallic notes found in JW Red. Palate is soft, rounded, creamy, with a hint of nail polish. Mmmmmm. Really sells this one. Finish is mercifully short. 

It’s better than JW Red, but that’s a low bar indeed. If you MUST get one of the Game of Thrones whiskies (disappointing finale notwithstanding), go for the Talisker or Lagavulin. I heard the Clynelish and the Mortlach were also quite nice. Let this one fade into oblivion just like the Night King..."

3.0,"Served as recommended, out of the freezer.

Nose - some vanilla and Apple, some spice... Cold glass feels nice in my hand, like having a cocktail.

Palate - bitterness prominent at first, rounds out a little as drank, but fairly one dimensional.  Vanilla notes hiding in the background.  

Finish - slightly harsh, somewhat like Danaerys's massacre of Kings landing, which happens to be what I'm watching as I drink this, so I may be slightly skewed.  It does however change into a subtle sweetness, not unlike a Canadian whisky.... Or is it the reunification of Cercei and Jamie Lannister I'm tasting?

Overall, probably best served as a component of a cocktail such as a rusty nail, or at least enjoyed with a large helping of Game of Thrones."

3.0,"Beautiful bottle. Beautiful tv series. Not so great whisky.

This Johnnie Walker White Walker edition is a special limited edition with a Game Of Thrones theme. The most interesting thing is that it is highly collectible and when you put it on the freezer the whole bottle reveals an icy format, and the words ""Winter is Here"" appears. Nice packaging.

Bottled at 41.7% abv, pale straw color.

Well.... this is grain whisky. It smells like grain whisky and tastes like grain whisky. 

On the nose: grain whisky profile. Corn, vanilla, fresh fields of corn,  grass, a cheap citric note and a very dim note of chocolate. 

On the palate, same grainy profile: Herbal, Grassy, Lots of grain, Oily and creamy, Corn, it feels Very young, Malty, Chocolate.  Aftertaste is short with ginger spice. 

Overall its like an alternative to Johnnie Walker Red Label, a very young whisky with lots of grain influence. Best to keep the bottle closed for your collection and nothing more. 62 over 100."

A gimmick through and through, but at least the bottle had a cool factor to it."

0.25,"It is fitting that this Scotch came out for the last two seasons of Game of Thrones. Much like the latter part of the show it is marketed for, it is horribly constructed and will leave you wishing for the original product. It is slightly more tolerable chilled or as a mixer, which is the only reason I'm scoring it over a 0. Make no mistake though, this is a truly awful bottle of Scotch, and is nothing more than a marketing gimmick.

Unless you're a huge fan of the books or show and want this as a collectors item, save your money and just buy a bottle of Red or Black."

3.0,Chilled in freezer. Smooth.
3.0,"Nose: Fruity with lots of vanilla. Almost smells like a really well-made yogurt. Never thought I’d say that in a Scotch review...

Palate: Very citrusy. Orange to be exact. A little vanilla comes in and compliments the orange.

Finish: Medium. Vanilla lingers a little bit. Smooth and simple.

Overall Thoughts: I don’t hate it. I know some people really did not enjoy this one and some people very much did. I know it has a kitschiness to it seeing that it’s basically just an ad campaign, but I don’t think it deserves to be brutalized the way I’ve seen it has been. For what it’s worth, I don’t see this as a bad dram. It would be fun to kick back and rewatch GoT and sip on this."
