2.75,"Hot hot hot... But what else do you expect from a 3 year old 120+ proof whiskey? The smell is sweet, like caramel. A very quick floral and citrus note on the palate, followed by an overwhelming synthetic cinnamon flavor (think, red hots). The cinnamon slowly fades into an oily, syrupy, maple finish."
