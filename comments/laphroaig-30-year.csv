4.0,"Extremely smooth, and slightly less smoky than regular laphroaig. For the price though, I don't think it would be worth it. Had a sampler bottle"

5.0,Smoky and smooth.  Notes of vanilla without being overly sweet. One of the best I've Everett had.

5.0,"Edit:  the following review is for an older release at 43%ABV, purchased in 2008. 

In the Glass: Golden syrup. 

On the Nose:  Big. Maritime Sherry with a backdrop of sweet smoke.  You can tell that this is an older malt, as it smells exactly like what I would expect Laphroaig's maturation warehouse to be like: wood, smoke, Sherry and the sea. 
It's like finding your grandfather's old jacket where he kept pipe tobacco, years after he's last worn it. 

Taste:  Echoes a lot of the nose , but the smoke is actually downplayed. The peat here is more bog than fireplace.  Long development of flavors, with the Sherry notes taking the lead.  Dried fruit. Dark brown sugar.  The finish turns pleasantly bitter, which sets up the sweetness of the next sip quite nicely. It clings to your tongue, lasting minutes after the glass is empty. 
Exhaling through your nose after a sip reminds me of the dying embers of a campfire. 
This is totally Bowmore 15's older, classier brother. 

Absolutely brilliant stuff.  I have a very hard time imagining a better whisky experience than this."

4.75,"Really enjoyed this. Fruity, especially tropical fruits, but sweet, not sour. Some crispy green apples, but again, the freshness, not the sour notes. Really well-rounded flavors. Sweet honey. And of course, the peat and smoke to balance the sweet and fruit. Much more mellow than the younger editions of Laphroaig, but oh so delicious... this is why I love single malt whisky!"

4.75,"Considerably smoother than younger expressions, and a touch sweeter as well. Smoke is less prominent. Fantastic whisky"

4.75,It’s really good.  Had the pleasure of trying this and the 28 year.  I enjoyed the 28 just a smidge more.  I mean if you got the cash you won’t be mad about this one.

4.75,super smooth and wonderful
4.5,This was exceptional. Thick mouthfeel with rich flavor and not nearly as much peat as expected. 4.6.
