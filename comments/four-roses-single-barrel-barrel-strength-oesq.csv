2.75,Ok for Bourbon
4.5,"The aroma, while not super complex, is extremely interesting. Initial nosing gives strong notes of overripe bananas, rose petals, cinnamon, musty oak, apple skins, and slight acetone. On the palate it’s an explosion of bananas, cinnamon candies, and brown sugar, with the floral elements easing in on the finish, along with a not unpleasant note of barrel bitterness. Further tasting brings out notes of buttery cookies, toffee, and an undertone of deep earthiness. A typically delicious example of a Four Roses barrel pick. 

Total Wine barrel pick: 55.2% ABV; aged 10 years"
4.25,"Payless Parker Liquors pick. 120.64 proof. 

Delicious honeysuckle nose, very little heat for the proof.

Hard to describe... bitter (but in a good way) floral notes, banana, a little mineral taste, very complex.

Finish is thick and destructive to the palate, a little water really mellows and thins it out."

4.0,"Neat. Neck pour. Binny’s pick, ~11year.  First time with a OESQ.  Vanilla frosting, chocolate and strawberries on the nose.  Almost reminds me of a crepe with a layer of baking spice behind it.  That chocolate note is my favorite aspect.

Thick and viscous on the tongue.  All brown sugar and baking spices.  Burnt caramel and chocolate on taste.

The longer I sit with it this floral component becomes more prominent on the nose and taste.

It’s delightful but just okay.  Somewhat of a let down for my first Four Roses Barrel Strength Store pick experience.  That chocolate note salvaged the entire experience."

3.0,little more ruff and not as smooth as the OESV.
3.0,Love it or hate it. Most polarizing blend four roses makes. No in between on the bottles.
4.0,Enjoyed this. I like the nose up front.
4.5,"Nose:
Palate: very complex, floral, banana"
4.0,"Greens store pick

Very similar to other OESQ recipes, mostly sweet and floral notes. Creeper bourbon, sneaks up on yah"
