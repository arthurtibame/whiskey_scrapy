4.25,"This is a great after dinner bourbon.  Not sure why the ratings are so low on this, yes it doesn’t taste like normal straight bourbon, but the flavors are fantastically smooth with pecan sweet flavor.  pour it over the rocks and enjoy!"
4.0,"The moment you open this bottle your nose is hit with the delicious smell of Butter Pecan Ice Cream. Very sweet taste, Pecans very present. Makes a great dessert sipper but a great mixer. Mixes excellent with Buffalo Trace Bourbon Cream."

5.0,"Drinking a 375ml. If you judge this as a flavored whisky it’s a 5 star. If you’re comparing it to your favorite scotch, it’s like comparing chocolate and steak.  Don’t. 

Reminds me of sipping Crown Vanilla"

4.5,"This flavored bourbon is one of the very best flavored whiskeys on the market today. It makes a near-perfect pairing with vanilla ice cream as a dessert. To me, this drink mixes the best characteristics of a soft bourbon and an amaretto. It has a soft delicate pecan/nutty flavor that stays in your mouth between each sip. If you like nutty liqueurs and bourbon this will most likely be a home run for you."
