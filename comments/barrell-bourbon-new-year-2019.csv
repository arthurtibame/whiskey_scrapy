4.0,"Light caramel, cloves, honey, butterscotch, golden delicious apples, and shortbread on the nose. The palate adds an element of light barrel char, candied ginger, corn custard, and a slight herbal background. The proof is not overbearing, with the sweetness of the palate making this a pleasant, almost easy sipper. Where bourbons like Elijah Craig Barrel Proof and Stagg Jr. are dark, rich, and complex, this bourbon, while similarly complex, is lighter and brighter, leaning more towards fresh fruit, light spice, and cream. A delicious, and surprisingly unique bourbon."
3.5,Sweet.

4.5,Very enjoyable wood char flavors with leather and some old funk. Those who look for classic vanilla notes may be disappointed. Those who prefer drier and even smoky bourbons will enjoy.

2.0,"A sample from dthom as part of the ""Whiskey transfer program"".  I'm inclined to want to like this as I'm a fan of the ""firewater"" as a friend calls it.  I like the barrel proof stuff and Barrell only paints in big bold high proof.

Nose:  Not at all what I'd expect.  Heavy citrus, some mint, heavy ethanol and a little solvent-y, young corn as well.  This smells like a young bourbon and not necessarily in a good way.  Not a lot of traditional vanilla/brown sugar bourbon scent going on here.

Flavor: The flavor is kind of subtle with vanilla, light sugars, light oak and then...gone.  The flavor goes right in to the finish after maybe half a second.

Finish:  A surprisingly long finish with heavy oak, black pepper, more mint, and drying tannic notes.  Ends up with more ethanol solvent notes that last...longer than I'd like.  Kind of off putting.

Overall I really wanted to like this but I think the whiskeys that were batched together to make this just didn't age long enough.  Kind of disappointing."
