4.0,"This release is the culmination of a tremendous amount of work! Bourbon Charity was presented a unique opportunity to procure nearly 200 bottles of this Rossville Pick selected by by a local Whiskey bar in Phoenix, Arizona. After tasting how good this pick was, Bourbon Charity was able to partner with the MGP brand rep to secure these at a price that would allow a significant donation to Bourbon Charity benefitting the Bartenders Guild. 

To allow our local Arizona Whiskey Community the opportunity to pick this up, we also partnered with our local retail shops who agreed to distribute this Charity release at a reduced margin as well. This bottle retails for $49.99 with a full $15/bottle going to Charity. 

Now let's dive in... 

It's got a rich mouthcoating entry with orchard fruit and vanilla notes that lead. Bold rye spice and clove on the mid palate, leaving a robust lingering spicy finish complemented by slight sweet mint and leather. It's lovely sweet and spice filled experience that showcases the best of MGP ryes. 
Not only is this benefitting our local service industry and a great charity but it's also a damn tasty rye!

Cheers all!"
