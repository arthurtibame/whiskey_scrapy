2.0,It's just not good bourbon. It has a stale taste that only becomes tolerable after about three glasses.

3.0,Not bad and surprisingly smooth. Sweet in the beginning turning to leather and slight fruit. A great buy for mixing.
2.0,"Nose - Initial nose is a bit harsh, rough ethanol. Transitions to hints of pineapple and a what seems like a very mellow honey that's been left out on the counter a bit too long. Hints of green apple skin, mint, and like a young sapling that's just been cut.
Taste - Faint hints of pear and apples that aren't quite ripe. So slightly dry and mildly sweet. Mellow hints of unripe bananas which transitions a bit into an unpleasant varnish like that used for finger nails.
Finish - Has a slight burn for the proof but feels a bit thin. Leaves you with a very dry mouthfeel that transitions to what I think is like if you took a bite into a dry, powdery apple that happened to taste like an unripe plantain. Has an oddly long finish that just sort of lingers and leaves an odd sour dill taste in your mouth.

4.0,Great bourbon for 20 bucks. Strong notes of vanilla and caramel with a long finish. Smooth on the rocks.

3.25,"Mild drinking, good everyday bourbon.  Not overly special, don’t use this to impress guests."
3.75,"Sleeper bourbon.  Definitely surpassed my expectations for the money and marketing fail of a name.

Slightly sweet at first, then comes some tartness, wood, char, and red hots.  Decently long finish.  A little hot, but flavorful.

Reminds me a bit of a younger, brasher, Rowan's Creek"

2.0,The name says it all.  Smoother on the taste but harsh on the finish.  Impulse buy and I need to resist the impulse in the future.

2.0,"Not terrible but nothing special. Tasted at a friend’s place. Was told it was ‘cheap’ and if that’s the case it’s really not bad at all for the price. Would be a good mixer and a small step up to replace Beam/Jack with some Coke. 

Ironically 2 stars gets 2 stars. But maybe that’s exactly the market they are going for with the whisky."

2.75,"Nose: apple, caramel, vanilla, cedar boards.
Palate: carries from the nose with some oak barrel spice and honey. A slight touch of that banana note you find in Jack Daniels. 
Finish: sweet oak vanilla and orchard fruit. 
This is solid for the price. An easy sipper and I would never turn down a glass. That said, it’s a bottom shelfer and shows in youthfulness and lack of integration. The flavors kind of hit all over the place and shows no real complexity. But, it far exceeded my expectations and drinks sweet and no harshness."
2.5,"It is what it is. Gave this 2.5 just for the price; $20 a bottle for a decent mixer isn’t a bad value.

Wouldn’t go out of my way for this otherwise. A not so sweet Maker’s Mark is the best review I’ve heard for this. Cheers!!"

2.75,"Decent with a rock, I enjoyed it very much after moving from a neat glass to rocks in a rocks glass.

Started neat and had a nose and taste of grass.

W/ice.  Mild grass with a sweet taste.  Very short finish with front of tongue taste.

I don’t remember what I paid for this bourbon but I don’t think it was expensive.  Maybe 20-25.   You can find better at this price but it’s not bad."

3.0,"Very easy to drink. Not overly complex, but you get a little bit of vanilla cinnamon and a little of the barrel. Can't beat it for the price."
2.75,Classic bourbon on the nose with nothing crazy to it. The taste is non-offensive with a bit of spice in.
