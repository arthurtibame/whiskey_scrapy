2.5,"Nose is heavily cherried.  The initial taste is all cherry, with little to no barrel flavor, then it finishes thin with a immature alcohol taste (think rubbing alchohol). Would be woth it, if the price was half what I paid ($45)"

2.75,"Tasted at room temperature / Glencairn glass / no water or ice added. 

Batch 04, Bottle 05199.  94 proof.  

The nose is alcohol and dried fruits... cherries and raisins.  It's got a woodiness about it too, but not a traditional oak.  Maybe I'm catching the variant aging process.  Maybe I'm catching the black cherry wood finish.  I'm also getting some holiday spices.

On the palate this has more burn than I'd expect from a 94.  It's showing youth.  It really seems underdeveloped to me.  Maybe a little orange or orange peel too?

The finish is actually the best part, though it doesn't linger as long as I would like.  Subtle vanilla, spice, and more orange finish this one off."

3.25,"Heat throughout. Musky finish, some berry fruits not as much as you might hope for from the name"
3.0,This is not bad. But not good either. It has an overpowering black cherry note. Drinks easy. Bourbon can’t shine through the cherry. Would not buy it. Try it in a bar first.

1.0,"The nose of this bourbon is pleasant, the sweet cherry, mild cinnamon, and a tinge of chocolate. 
The palate however is so overpowered by a sweetened cherry and ethanol that you can taste little else. This rapidly aged bourbon lacks the nuance and smoothness of a traditionally aged whiskey."
