2.0,"Not that bad, as I thought it was. Nose: smoke, cigarette smoke, a shade of sour dough (bad thing, definitely). Taste: pepper, smoke. Aftertaste: short, peppery.
        Update: two days after bottle was opened (hello, screw cap), smoke mostly disappeared, and shades of sun-dried fruits come on the foreground. No more ""sour dough"" smell. Taste and aftertaste remains the same. Total: 2.3/5 stars (68 score)."

3.0,Sweet and with a little wood spice and a little smoke in a short finish. A bit thin and watery but you can't complain with the price. A serviceable everyday whisky to the budget strapped 😋

3.25,The Lagavulin at its heart comes through
2.25,"Doesn't need any water, balance is nice. Has that smokey wood bite of scotch. Needs no ice, but is pretty bland. Nice for the price, but only a step or two above Kirkland."
