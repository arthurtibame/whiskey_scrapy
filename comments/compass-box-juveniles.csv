2.75,"The nose is light and possibly young (though not excessively so) with some nice complexity. It has a surprising amount of Sherry presence with some vanilla, giving it a sweet profile. There's maybe something a hint nutty here too that gives it some richness. The palate has more cardboard and waxiness than expected. It's also less fruity and fairly numbing. It isn't terribly sweet. It reminds me a bit of Glenfiddich 14 Bourbon with its general malty character. It definitely tastes like a 12 year scotch. There are a lot of standard scotch flavors in here, but nothing really exciting. This might be about on the level of Highland Park 12, but it's a bit more watery without the smoke and some alcohol stars coming out."
3.0,"Translucent yellow-gold. Nose has smoke and a nose hair tingling burn. Once past that initial hit, it mellows to aromas of vanilla and coconut. The palate is very smooth and clean with a slight oily viscosity. Flavors resemble the nose with an added red fruit component. Pleasant burn down the throat and an almost numbing feeling on the tongue. I love compass box but as good as this is, I’m underwhelmed for the price tag."
3.75,"I quite enjoyed this one. Very simple flavoured dram, light and ethereal but carries and delivers the vanilla note well. I'm alternating between a 3.5 and 3.75 on this one. 3.5 because it's simple but 3.75 because it does simple in a very well balanced rounded way. Started at a 3.75 as after the poorly constructed Tomatin 18 which showed complete lack of care, skill or respect for the distillate this does. But then towards the end got slightly boring and i saw what the price was so 3.5 it is. But then after reviewing all drams on the day this was 2nd or 3rd so back to 3.75 it is.

Now interestingly value wise this was £100 pounds which was an exorbitant rip off. I appear to be not the only one who thought so as MoM now has it 1/3rd off at £65. Looks like the CB bubble if not whiskey in general is about to deflate if not burst...about time. There are a few expressions which come to mind, about those swimming naked when the tide flows out and the emporer having no clothes which are now going to come into play (ok the moral of those stories doesn't actually apply to overpriced whiskeys trading on their status for a price premium but the figurative implications sound close :-))"
4.5,Have I said before that I love Compass Box? They are truly making some of the best bottles on the market.  Nose on this has hints of smoke and anise. Flavor brings light showers of vanilla followed by a rush of caramel. Finish is a mellow smolder of heat and burnt creme brulee sugar. Overall another solid offering.
4.25,"Nose: sweet cereal grains, honey, Fuji and green apples, subtle floral (carnations?), slight coconut.

Taste: similar notes as above, heavy on the honey, good mouthfeel.

Finish: surprisingly long given the abv. Oak, grains, floral.

94/100*

*I rank my whiskey based on a 100 point scale. It is a cumulative score with each category of nose, taste, finish, and balance worth up to 25 points. Here is how this score translates to the number of stars I give:

0 stars = 50 or below
1 star = 60
2 stars = 70
3 stars = 80
4 stars = 90
5 stars = 100

The score is rounded to the closest 1/4 star increment."

4.25,I love this as a summer whiskey. Floral and citrus in spades. Interesting enough to hold it's own and still be spritely and light. Would happily repurchase a third time.

4.0,"Light, airy, fruity nose. Same on the taste. Not too sweet, with lots of fruit"
3.75,Interesting nose. Started with spice and faded to fruit. Would love to try this when I had not just had spicy food...
3.25,Tastes very similar to Old Pulteney 12 but not as rich.

3.5,"The rate at which Compass Box releases whiskies tailored to the specifications of a restaurant or retailer has me hopeful that it won’t be too long before individual consumers can order customised blends in the same way that we can design our own sneakers or suits online. Give me a funky nose with a nutty, peaty body and a lightly sherried finish and I think I’ll be set, thank you. That’s not what the Juvenile restaurant behind this release ordered up, but it’s still another enjoyable composition by John Glaser. You get the fresh floral aromas of a spring morning, followed in the mouth by flavors of malt, whipping cream and milky tea. It finishes strong with caramel and a burst of red pepper flakes. It’s another solid Compass Box release, better than some of the more mediocre ones though not memorable enough to make my top 10. Worth trying, though I wouldn’t buy a full bottle at this price."
3.5,"I was going into this one pretty low expectations but a vanilla bomb with light and sweet notes, great body, great mouth feel, and just hits on all key notes.  If you're looking for a sweater vanilla forward scotch, this is wonderful.  It's really one of compass boxes's better sweeter forward bottles.  

89-91 range for me.  I'll go 89 given the 100+ price but it's really close to the 90's and if it were under 100 I'd give it just for value.  Worth it at 130, though i've seen it for 150 and he's where I'm getting iffy on value.  At that price you might get disappointed."
