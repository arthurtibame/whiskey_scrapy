4.0,"I pick up the apple chips in the nose, appropriate maybe to its apple juice color.  Neat, I taste corn tapering to anise before a long tail of alcohol burn.  Adding a bit of water or maybe because it's been in the glass longer there is corn on the nose and a sweet oily mouth feel.  Like its color, the overall experience is one of lightness. A true maverick, there is no suggestion of bourbon or scotch. A nice whiskey to drink and savor."

4.0,"Nose was almost like cotton candy. Tasted a little more like a Scotch than a  Bourbon to me. A lot of depth and a warm, smoky finish. Nice."
