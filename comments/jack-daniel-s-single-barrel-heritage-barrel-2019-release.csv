3.0,"Been a lot of hype on this one and ran into a friend of a friend with a case so I was able to snag a bottle.  

Nose - vanilla bomb, some oak, some banana.

Taste - more vanilla, this is heavy vanilla, very candied and sweet. I think of the oak here as a toasted barrel type finish. You get some of that jack banana and dr pepper as well, but the underlying flavor is all vanilla. The abv comes in about right but I guess a bit soft vs the double barrel barrel proof. 

Anyway, really good dram from jack, showcasing their over the top sweet profile in a very nicely made and drinkable version. 

3 stars, well above average whisky and an impressive job by jack."

3.25,"The nose is at first, surprisingly ester- and ethanol-forward. After a moment it is dominated by extremely overripe, mushy bananas, Nilla Wafers, butterscotch pudding, and something a bit like pear skins. Almost too sweet on the nose. The palate is also extremely sweet, though overall quite pleasant. It is immediately evocative of classic banana pudding, coming out as more Nilla Wafers, whipped cream,banana cream pie, and melted vanilla ice cream. On a second sip, there’s an element that reminds me of slightly overcooked butter cookies and dulce de leche. The finish is quite short, with a burst of cinnamon and baked apple, and a lingering note of fresh apples, vanilla, and browned butter. Good but wayyyy too sweet. 

Definitely the best Jack Daniel’s that I’ve had (still haven’t tried the barrel proof), but a bit more sweet and friendly then I typically prefer. Overall the flavor and experience is uniquely distinct from being a classic bourbon (yes I know it’s a TN whiskey). Fortunately it shies away from the classic Jack Daniel’s banana peel notes, offering a rich, tasty, entry level offering for those that want to spend a little more on a premium product without going full bore on a barrel proof offering. Still just a little too sweet for my preferences."
2.0,"I’m getting something funky on this. I get the toasted barrel but I don’t know if it’s tobacco, leather, or some other earthy note that is a bit off-putting. This is the only bottle I’ve opened and I’m wary to open another. I’ve given this bottle at least a month and it hasn’t softened. Maybe it’s cork rot? It’s almost... moss-like in the flavor. I was expecting really good things and this feels closer to a drain pour."
4.5,I really like this. It’s JD so I feel it gets overlooked. Neat. Nose is sweet caramel maple. Taste is sweet caramel and oaky with a dry caramel oaky peanut finish.

4.5,Toasted Oak. Maple. Banana. Vanilla. Caramel. Dense and chewy mouthfeel. Medium sweetness. Some heat towards the end.

4.5,Just incredible. The smell.. the flavor.. the color. Absolutely well done.
4.25,"Nose: Fruit, Vanilla, Oak & Bubble Gum
Palate: Fruit but doesn't have that banana taste like the Single Barrel Select
Finish: Lingering warmth & mellow as well as some oak

Jack D did not disappoint with this release!"
4.5,Like 1910 only very much smoother.   Easy sipper. Not the JD you think of

4.5,"Neat.  Incredible.  Intense chocolate, vanilla and graham cracker.  Delicious on the nose.  No banana, which I typically associate with Jack.

Medium body texture, immediately spicy on the tongue.  Maple and cinnamon.  Transitions back to the intense vanilla and hint of graham cracker.

Not complex but a delicious sipper.  Different flavor profile than the other Jack single barrels.  I like this a lot!"

4.75,"Surprisingly delicious, just like last year’s Heritage release.  This is by far the best Jack Daniels product I’ve tasted and there isn’t a close second.  The toasted barrel notes really come through in a sweet, spicy, and bitter oak-bomb.  Comparable to Old Forester 1910 and Woodford Double Oak (all of which are Brown-Forman) but smoother and I suspect a bit older due to such deep flavor at 100 proof.

I would drink this everyday if it was available."
