3.0,"Aroma similar to a blended whiskey, not very complex or impressive.  Aroma is sweet and has hints of honey.  Taste has hint of oak.  Ininiat sip was slightly aggressive and had a burn but gets better with next sips.  Leaves an undesirable aftertaste.  Good for a value whiskey."

Palate: Light, little smoke, quite limited

1.0,"Pure Rubbing alcohol nose, worst I have ever smelled. Taste is not terrible, but bland. Hint of smoke. Touch of caramel and vanilla, black pepper, slightly herbal and bitter citrus. Tastes cheap. Rough on the tongue, though surprisingly smooth swallow. 
HOT TAKE: tastes like bad gin.
HOT TAKE 2: ""Journey"" definitely refers to the rollercoaster of flavors experienced in this whisky.

1.75,"It says heavily peated on the bottle but doesn’t smell or taste like it. I really like the Jura 10, but if you like that DON’T buy this. It smells weird like play dough or silly putty that is sweet and honestly doesn’t smell like peat. I smell dried cow patties and tall grass from the ranch. Golden amber color. The taste isn’t horrible but there is a delayed afterburn to it. It’s smooth to start and savory through the middle but ends with some peated spice. WAY Better with water added but still not something I’d buy (a drunken Scotsman bought me a round and ordered the 10 but they were out, so we got this). With water you actually get peat, smoke, and a bit of sardines."
2.25,"Smells  like peat.  Taste is mild at first then turns medicinal.  Very smooth even undiluted.  Heavy smoke aftertaste, seems unbalanced and heavy at the end."
3.25,Sweet and fruity with very subtle peat.

2.75,"Yeah..it’s not awful but it’s not great. A budget buy that tastes like a budget buy, unfortunately. Tastes like a blend. Would probably be better on the second or third pass or on rocks/with water."

2.5,"As an entry level NAS to the Jura range, I think the best I can say is that it’s decidedly OK.

There’s an upfront light alcohol hit, reminiscent of an average blend more than a decent Highland malt.  It is light overall, with some hinted flavours of vanilla, caramel, fruit and a little spicy smoke.  The finish is short with some residual spice and a hint of smoke.  None of these flavours are very much at the forefront of the flavour, but rather they all hover around in the background.

This is a perfectly drinkable dram.  It’s reasonable at the typical discounted supermarket price point of c£22-25ish, but at the RRP at around £10 more there are other, more characterful whiskies that I’d choose over this expression."

3.5,Very little peat. Picks up a lot of bourbon notes from the barrel.

2.25,Not getting much out of this one. Possibly a touch of citrus in the smell. Not much grip on the glass. Noting much of a remaining flavour on it. The slightest traces of smoke detected.

3.0,"Decent whiskey, sharp at first but smoothes out when drinking more, sharp after burn."
2.25,Very little peat for saying it’s supposed to be prayed
