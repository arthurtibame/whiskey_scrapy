2.75,"The nose has a hint of what reminds me ever so slightly of urine. Not in an insulting way, but rather a hint of ammonia over a leathery note. The leather is a new leather, like a car interior. 
There’s a bite in the initial moment of the sip that feels like it is saying “haha! just kidding! gotcha!” ...followed promptly by good behavior like a straight “C’s” student turning in his homework at the last minute."
3.0,"Nose: a solid base of brine and light smoke; bandaid like.

Palate: very aggressive with the bandaid smoke and brine notes. Light/dry texture. 

Finish: slight tart fruit notes that shows as the alcohol burn fades."
