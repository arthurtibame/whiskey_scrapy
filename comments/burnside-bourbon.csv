5.0,"Discovered this while on a trip to Portland, and liked it well enough to import 6 bottles to SF. My bottle has blue, rather than red, type and outline so it may be different."

4.0,Nice and hot.
3.0,"Startlingly sweet, with a flavor more adolescent than you might expect from a 4-year. Very hot, like a chemical fire, with an interesting fruitiness hiding somewhere underneath. Doesn't hurt to throw in a splash of water to soften the blow."

1.5,"Sharp and biting. Not good alone and stood out in a bad way with mixers (ginger beer, seltzer)."

4.0,The rebranded teal label Burnside Bourbon is a FAR better product than the old ‘Ambrose’ version pictured. Super oaky with cinnamon notes. It’s an aggressive bourbon but not harsh. And a damn fine Oregon product.

2.0,This company needs to disclose on their bottle that it's a sweet bourbon not representative of traditional bourbon and it's a new experience. It's definitely not my flavor profile when wanting a bourbon. It's in the family of Jack Daniels Honey. Great for desert.
2.0,"A bit smoother than the Oregon Oaked, but with less refinement. For $50 a bottle, I'll keep one around because it's local, but won't be one of my go-to's."

3.0,This stuff is solid. It's sweet with a warmer finish. It has a lighter and less complex body  but is bold in its exit. (FWF share #6)
