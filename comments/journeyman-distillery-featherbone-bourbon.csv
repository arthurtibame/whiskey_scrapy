3.0,"One ice cube. Vanilla, but a lot of bite. Not too smooth. Quick finish."
3.0,Strong vanilla and icing on the nose. Sweet but leathery with a gentle taste from beginning to end. Better with a cube of ice as it balances out the sweetness.

2.5,Not exactly my cup of tea. To me the cedar is a bit over powering. Both on the nose and the finish. Im afraid it's something that for me I can't get past.

3.0,This one leans to the sweet side a bit. Stronger corn flavors... has some spice in the end near the finish. A decent sipping bourbon.

3.5,"Sweet, vanilla, oak taste.  Nose is vanilla literally and metaphorically.  Love that it’s local wish it didn’t cost so much."

2.75,"Nose: Vanilla, apple, dusty metal.

Taste: More vanilla taking a tart woody bitter turn then ending with metal or bloody lip. 


Experience: Icecream after splitting your lip on the baseball field, sweet but hard to enjoy with all the dust and metal in your mouth."

3.0,"Every year, after Thanksgiving, I join my wife's family in the annual trek to the Christmas tree farm outside of Three Oaks, Michigan. I can give or take on all the Yuletide trappings, but since Three Oaks is home to Journeyman Distillery...I'm willing to put up with a day of holly jolly crap to swing by the distillery. I picked up a few items this year; the Featherbone bourbon is the weakest link. A spicy-sweet, but unremarkable, nose leads into a noticeably sweet, gingerbread spiced palate that has just too much young spirit character and not much of a finish. I'm feeling generous enough to call it three stars since this isn't bad, just disappointing considering the comparative quality of their other products."

4.0,"Very spicy and alcoholic (tasting the cask strength version), but also has great flavor! 

***EDIT: tasted the regular one afterwards. Solid 3.5. Good bourbon."

2.0,"Nose- definitely has the nose of a young bourbon. Sweet corn notes are present with a bit of brown sugar. 
Body- Sweet and oily with grass and unsalted peanuts. 
Finish- grass and peanuts continue.

Notes- A young bourbon with h a bite but not unpleasant."
2.0,Sweet toffee and chocolate on the nose. Grassy and dry mouthfeel.

2.75,"I can’t say that it’s a horrible bourbon, but there seems to be a chain-link fence flavor chased with vanilla. The sweetness of the vanilla (even though I’m not a huge fan of extra sweet bourbons) saves this to make it palatable."

3.0,vanilla. vanilla. vanilla. its like having an ice cream cone. Starts out very sweet with heavy vanilla. The finish is relatively short. The sweet vanilla of this bourbon has you wanting more.
2.5,"It’s fully hard to describe the aftertaste of all Journeyman whiskeys that I’ve ever had, but I will try.

The nose of this one smells of paint thinner or rubbing alcohol. Genuinely doesn’t smell like something drinkable. Body is relatively smooth with a simple and subtle honey flavor, which becomes stronger on the finish alongside mild cinnamon.

That aftertaste...

Old pennies? Galvanized nails? It’s something that strikes a bourbon drinker as an impurity, but it’s in so much of their stuff that I think it has to be either part of their process or part of their raw materials. Not bad, not much to desire. Many many better things on shelves for cheaper."

3.0,Decent.
3.0,"The nose is very sweet of green apple, cinnamon, a slight hint of vanilla and oak. The palate is sweet of green apple and baking spice, slightly rich, with vanilla that opens up to coat the mouth. The finish is medium and sweet that fades quickly. Fairly simple bourbon."
3.75,"Got my bottle from a single barrel
aroma - spicy, brown sugar, vanilla and oak
taste - initially very hot but as it breathes it opens up a sweet brown sugar vanilla base with hints of cherry and finishes with rye spice"

1.0,"This bottle is four years old and opened around that same timeframe.

Sadly, the nose and first taste notes hit me like a bucket of cleaning product, something with ammonia.  Not at all enjoyable.

I’ll try again some other day and see if I get a different feel for this Michigan bourbon, but had to dump the remainder of this dram into the sink."
