4.0,"Fruity up front, with spice to follow. Very mellow. Medium finish"
3.75,Comparable to Jack. A little smoother
5.0,Great whiskey here. Notes of butterscotch throughout with a smooth finish and the perfect heat
4.0,Enjoyed the taste for how mellow it is.  It has a little scotch feel in the finish and overall it was really enjoyable to drink.

3.0,"For a rye, it's got some flavor other than spice.  It lingers on for a medium finish.   Great for Manhattan."
3.75,"N: Baking spices and faint caramel
P: Forward fruit notes. Spice all the way through, it's a rye playing as a bourbon.
F: Dry and mild. Lingering oak."
4.0,"Color: Light amber

Nose: Caramel is very heavy on the nose, light vanilla, with baking spices, rounded by pears and green apples. With some mild molasses making an appearance. 

Palate: Medium bodied with a velvety mouthfeel. Caramel and green apples lead the way as oak and spiciness join in the middle leading to a unique finish that heats up then mellows out leaving lingering caramel and green apples."

3.0,"Bright fruit on the nose, brown sugar. Smells like apple pie. A slight earthy note as well. Rye kick immediately on the palate, although it doesn't seem to last. Smooth, albeit a little thin. But layers of flavor, baking spice, toasted wood, zest. Sweet, but a slight astringent note as well. Perhaps my favorite in the 1792 lineup. 1/28/18"

3.25,While running to catch the sunset on Brooklyn Bridge and the cold wind pierces through our skin- worth every bit- just like every second with him
4.25,In an old fashioned. When she says “I’m having very dirty thoughts” and all you can think is “check please!!”
3.75,"Nose: large  florals, rose-honey suckle, rye spice, candied fruits small herbal

Front: oily sweet head with big spice portions and very notable barton wood  flavoring combine with faint bourbon notes of heather vanilla and dark sugars.   

Finishes mild  with warm spice and sweet after notes

This is indeed a rare concoction of a nice rye bill recipe with some unusual herbal floral range and some very good bourbon base flavoring,  I like what Buffalo Trace has done here, it's a lot of pleasant flavors and notes with nothing off putting  and that includes the relatively mid range price tag you should find on this bottle.    If you like a high rye bourbon you won't want to miss this one, an easy addition to the home bar and relatively mild but enticing drinker, with just enough complexity to make it a conversation starter,  it just begs to be sipped  through the night.  

Well done BT and cheers!"
4.25,"The tasting notes are spot on. This bourbon is very sweet and fruity(apples/pears). 

Ryes typically turn people off due to the spice but that spice isn’t there. It’s very smooth. 

If you find it grab a bottle or two. I’m keeping my bar stocked with this."

3.5,"Happy Friday to all my fellow Whiskey lovers! This afternoon I have the pleasure of sampling one of the limited edition 1792 Bourbon. I really enjoyed the full proof and sweet wheat and have been told this may be the pick of the bunch. As the name suggests this is a higher rye mashbill (undisclosed) that's aged for a little over 8 years. On the pallette you start pretty sweet with toffee, caramel and hint of apples. Mid pallette has pepper not and some oak. Finish is meduim and gets a good dose of heat. Vanilla and bunt cake tail off with more pepper. 
It's a nice pour. For $8 I can't complain. For $35 a bottle its a solid value. Will I hunt for it? No. Will I buy it if I see it for $35? Absolutely! It's a big upgrade on the original and on par with the Sweet Wheat. Cheers all!"

4.0,"Mild-Spicy nose. Caramel, fruity taste. Rye heat towards the end with short finish."
5.0,"Very inviting nose, tons of sweet fruit, hard to pinpoint the exact scents. Nice and buttery on the palate with more sweet fruit notes and a slight oak. The rye really comes in at the end for a medium finish. Very enjoyable and now one of my favorites from Barton"

4.0,"Light amber color. Medium bodied with a velvety mouthfeel.

Nose: loads of caramel sweetness with some vanilla. Green apple and pear accented by baking spices. Mild molasses sweetness is also hiding in the aroma which is complex than I expected.

Palate: rich caramel sweetness and green apples are strong at first. Spices and some oak appear as the whiskey heats up through the middle to the finish. The finish is big, warming, and smooth. It’s rounded off by more candy sweet caramel-apples like the kind you get at a county fair. It leaves that sweet taste behind inviting another sip. 

I’m pleasantly surprised by this whiskey. This and 1792’s Sweet Wheat are my favorites from their line up that I’ve tried.

3.9/5 stars or 4/5 on here."

3.25,"Tasted neat in a glencairn.

Nose - Dominated by the standard bourbon notes of caramel, oak, and vanilla with some faint varnish. Also some fresh apples and .

Palate follows the nose with caramal, oak, baking spices and orange peel. The rye spice lingers on the moderate finish without being harsh. Not much bite at all.

As it had a chance to breathe in the glass, caramel and vanilla became more prominent on the nose while the palate become a bit sweeter.

This is a good example of a well-crafted KY bourbon. I'd rate it better than the 1792 Small Batch or Single Barrel - the rye spice and heavier oak make this more interesting to me. Previously the BiB was my favorite  from 1792, I'll need to do a side-by-side to see if this one edges out the BiB."
2.5,Very alcohol forward on smell. Has a smooth beginning middle and end. No real bite like most ryes. Enjoyable but nothing to write home about.
4.5,sweet and spicy without the burn.
