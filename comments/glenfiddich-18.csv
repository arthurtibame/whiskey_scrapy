3.0,"Aged in small batches in Oloroso and American oak casks, this pours a rich bronze and opens with aromas of caramel, vanilla and floral notes on the nose; incredibly smooth and mellow on the palate with hints of sweet dried fruit, candied orange peel and subtle oak spice followed by a long and rewarding, finish."
null,"My philosophy: “the top selling companies must be doing something right”; on that notion I went out to grab glenfiddich 18. I hit 6 different locations on my rainy day search in Michigan- no dice - the deck was rapidly stacking up against Glenfiddich as i frustratingly hit liquor store after liquor store trying to find what I imagined would be readily available- I finally found it. During my purchase I felt impatient as the store owner politely yet thoroughly bent my ear about HIS whiskey tastes and -, all the while I was thinking to my self “this could be another disappoint, I mean HELL! this is fan fair whiskey for god sakes” and “Am I not considering what $100 could do if I put into my IRa? But, this whisky could be great TODAY?!” - all in all I was emotionally preparing for disappointment. 
I got back to my room - I smelled my armpit, raised my eyebrows and deduced that I needed a shower and wondered if my body sweat would affect my tasting? ... probably not, get real Joel.  After this long day I quickly and CARELESSLY ripped off the aluminum topper and poured one finger into a plastic cup; I thought: this had better be good. Sniff, sip....

Wow! Yep, heck yeah - smooth, smokeless, round mouth feel, pears, chocolate, caramel, medium length finish, and an 18 year funkless taste. I’m quite happy I rolled the dice on this one- it’s very tasty and worth the hundred clams. I really can’t imagine anyone with even a marginally developed whisky palate being disappointed with this whiskey, it’s very nice. 
I hope all of you readers out there are having a nice day with your families, and if you’re looking for a nice whiskey without having to  spend an arm and a leg - buy a bottle of Glenfiddich 18, it won’t disappoint.  👍🏼"

4.0,"I sampled this in a tasting with the 15 year old Solera Reserve and the 12 year old from the same stable and this was clearly the better dram. 
 
On the nose I got warm spices, oak, linoleum and undiluted nostalgia - I was stopped in my tracks and had a full Anton Ego flashback (damn you, limbic system!) to the house of a childhood friend. 

The palate was beautifully warm and smooth with a taste of toffee, raisins, orange and oak.  I left it 15 minutes to open, and water doesn’t help this at all IMO.  

Altogether a very fine whisky and, for me this evening, liquid wistfulness. 4 stars."

5.0,"After initially trying this at a bar, I was able to pick up a bottle a few months later. The first time I had it, it was really good but I did not let it rest like I should have. Trying it at home was a game changer. I let it rest for about 20 minutes and it changed everything. It is sweet and outrageously smooth. For an 18 year, I think it is priced great but still expensive enough to limit how often I will be able to enjoy it. It’s like it’s telling me a story. The palate starts off sharp and fruity but I think I enjoyed the finish the most, long and drawn out, tasting like candy. It has catapulted towards the top of my favorites I have had so far."

Nose: dark fruit from the sherry casks, raisins and honey sweetness. Orange rind, molasses, and allspice also appear.

Palate: honey and bright citrus fruit at first. Oranges, jam, some baking spices. Light vanilla cake. A touch of dark chocolate.

Finish: the finish is fairly long and mellow. It starts with a pop of honey-lemon citrus then drifts off into the sunset: more fruit baskets, vanilla, honey, and all that pleasant sweetness."

3.25,"It's a chilly 45 degrees in SoCal tonight and I am sitting in front of a fireplace having just put our youngest to bed. After searching thru parents liqour cabinet I had a good number of Scotch options but this one really stood out. I was curious to see how much of an upgrade it was over the fairly mediocre 12 yr expression. Have a a Lag 16 tee'd paired with an Arturo Fuente Opus X after this dram, it's looking like a good night! On to the tasting:
Upon entry it's a lovely buttery entry with grassy malt, an array of dried fruits and some orange peel. The Sherry notes show on the mid pallette with a medium finish with malt chocolate and dark fruit notes. A nice pour to be sure, however, if I had paid the $100 price tag I would be bitterly dissapionted. $60 seems about right for this one. At this price point I would pass. As it is I will enjoy the rest of the bottle throughout the week! On to the Lag 16! Cheers All!"

Paladar: Basicamente as mesmas notas identificadas no aroma, apimentado de gengibre, amadeirado, algum amargor de taninos e dulçor. Salivação. Dulçor, frutado, baunilha, oleosidade e canela. 

Finalização: Media para longa, mas suave. Amargor e apimentado vem à tona acompanhados de um bom dulçor e baunilha. 

Impressões gerais: Não há um grande salto de complexidade em relação ao seu irmão mais novo, o Glenfiddich 15 Solera Reserve, mas é certamente um ótimo whisky. Facilmente encontrado no Brasil (às vezes em ótimas promoções) este whisky agrada connoisseurs e iniciantes, devido a sua alta qualidade.

4.25,Do you like breakfast food? Well you are in luck because apart from the traditional scotch flavors lies some rich well rounded sweet breakfast flavors. The smell will remind you of a maple covered waffle. Then you get a very balanced and well rounded traditional Spyside scotch flavor. As the flavors build up after each sip you will start to get a little bit of a coffee finish. Which is a nice touch to finish it off with. The 18 year old age statement and the flavor profile make this a great whisky to impress your friends with....or just for you to enjoy by yourself. Either way this is a must buy for any scotch lover.

Taste : Pretty malty and oaky in the beginning, it gets quickly smooth and the fruits are much more subtle. Apples and vanilla are still present. Cinnamon tings in the end, giving a little spicy side. 

Finish : Malt is on the high note, but as it disappears, a lengthy sweet note, subtle and smooth, with touches of apples, finishes the sip."

This was really nice to have and I'd enjoy it if offered, but I think the ginger would prevent me from keeping a bottle on the shelf. If there's something else out there that tastes the same, but without the ginger, sign me up."

3.5,"This is an excellent whiskey that I can appreciate. I yearn for more flavors of peat, spice, and saltiness, and this has very little of any of those (which is pretty consistent with Glenfiddich if I’m correct). While this doesn’t exactly fit my taste, I can see its appeal. Notes of sweet fruit and caramel apple are most prominent to me."

3.75,"Neat in Glencairn at home. Present from a young client's parents; this is one I would likely never have bought for myself, given the price point and the style.  Cheers!

Nose is sweet sherry over mild oak, strong apples on top, hint of honeysuckle, a big hit of Asian pear, followed by mild heather.  Taste is a touch less fruity, but the apples and pears do remain, with some astringent oak notes, sweet candy citrus peel, finishing with a lingering mild spice.  

Pretty darn good.  Definitely be happy with it as a gift, probably buy it on sale.  02/03/2020."

4.0,"Really like the classic 12 and the 14. Love the 19 year and this 18 year is great too. I do love the 19 more because of the exclusive bourbon casking. The 18 is a sherry bomb to end all sherry bombs. Normal typical glenfiddich notes then sherry turned up to 11. Nose is all light fruit apple and pear, sherry dark stewed fruit of plums and golden raisins. A malt, honey and candy syrup sweetness made a bit sweeter by the sherry presence. No alcohol or oak on the nose. Taste is that typical buttery, butterscotch, apple and pear, honey and sweet Glenfiddich with the strong addition of the plum and raisin notes from the sherry, some barrel bite and spice from the age and late palate into the finish a touch of bitterness and oak from the age. Finish is medium as the oak, bitter tannin, fruit and sweetness all hang out with the sweetness dropping off first. Really a nice treat wouldn't drink this all the time but it's a really good dessert/ after dinner whisky. Price limits this as a daily drinker as well even though it and Glenfarclas varieties are well priced considering age and quality of juice inside."

Palate- juicy apples, vanilla toffee, ginger, candied orange, apricot, melon, raw sugar

Finish- Long, spicy finish with notes of toffee, melon, and ginger spice

Fantastic dram. Balanced all around with an excellent level of complexity. Could drink this all day. This is like a bouquet of fruits and sweetness. The marriage of sherry and bourbon cask here really works. Love the apples on the nose and candied fruits on the palate, with a long finish thats all you can ask for out of a whisky."

4.75,"Nose: Really a lot going on!  Dried fruits but also citrus. I also get saltwater taffy here, which was a surprise. Definitely some floral notes, especially rose.

Palate: Initially very rich, sweet, and smooth with lots of vanilla and brown sugar notes.  Floral flavours coming through early on as well.  Some mild oak spiciness and tanniny mouthfeel then follows rounding out the flavour profile very nicely. 

Finish: Medium to long. Notes of black peppercorns, peppermint, and burnt toffee. 

Overall I think this is a fantastic whisky, especially given the price point for an 18 year old single malt."

4.0,"Expected a lot more. Glenfiddich is one of my favorite brands, i love its profile, i love the marketing they use, i loved the 2 drams i had before. This one, as most 18 yo whiskies i have had, didn't impressed me.

It seemed they tried to do something very Fancy, easy drinkable, almost a dessert. 

Bottled at 40%abv, color: amber.

On the nose, still in the bottle, has this Cherry cola aroma. In the glass, it has a Dark Chocolate, Vanilla, spicy note, also a slight very muted peat, and as the bottle went emptier, some saltyness as well.

On the Palate is sooooo smooth. It is not a Whisky is a dessert. No burn at all,  caramel, toffee notes, oranges, a little spicy, with a very very very short dry grass finish. Almost no Finish and almost no body. It is so light and Ultra Smooth that you can empty the bottle very quickly. It is a great dram for people who drink whisky, but for critics is a great flavored dram, but boring. Fancy as it gets, it is very enjoyable to drink it with cake or after a meal. I really tried it to be an 8 over 10, but it really is a 7.5 over 10."
