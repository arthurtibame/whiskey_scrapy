4.0,"(Sampled with 3 small ice chips)
Nose is light; oak and Ethanol.
Palate is oak and vanilla wafer
Finish is fairly long and pleasant.
The novelty of it being a GA-Only spirit is worth half a star, to be honest."

3.0,"Christmas Gift from Jaz and Drew. 3 stars. Not too complex. Had neat. Will let it open up a bit, and will re-visit in a month or so.
    Drinkable.
UPDATE August 3, 2017: Just got this out and had a dram. Update to 3.5 or maybe even 4 stars. Nice nose, good flavor profile. Oak, vanilla, cinnamon, some fruit, and maybe just a little black walnut. Very enjoyable. It opened up very nicely. Would recommend."
3.0,Sweet taste. Not bad.
