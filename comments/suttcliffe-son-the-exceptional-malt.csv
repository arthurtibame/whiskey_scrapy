This just got better and better over time. Rich, viscous, malty, fruity and nutty with a hint of peat smoke. Mmm, so good."

3.0,"Not worth the money in my opinion, it all just tastes like heavy oak.

Nose - an oak bomb in your face, with a bit of malty grain
Taste - strong oak spice at the beginning, a bit of sweet notes in the background
Finish - okay spice burns for a bit, and you get some more bitter notes at the end"

From the label: ""An extraordinary range of mature casks, including Glenfarclas, Ben Nevis, Balvenie, Kininvie, Glenfiddich, Alt-a’Bhainne, Auchroisk, Glenallachie, Westport, Speyside and (of course) Macallan distilleries, were blended and married in first-fill Oloroso sherry butts...""

Nose: Berry crumble, honey, a hint of orange liquor, amaretto and peat smoke.
Palate: slightly viscous and oily, hazel nuts, sherry notes and vanilla.
Finish: Medium to long and warming with a very pleasant sherry/amaretto note.

Every time I try this, I like it a little better.

Would probably never have bought this at suggested retail, but a certain on-line retailer in Orange County had this on sale for near half of that, which makes it a steal, especially for a blend which contains however small amount of 30 year old Macallan."
