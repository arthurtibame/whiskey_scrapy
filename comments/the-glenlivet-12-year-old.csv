2.5,"Cinnamon, heat at the end, apple, subdued, probably needed some water to be more enjoyable"
3.5,"Orange peel, honeysuckle and light peat notes
Soft warm mouth feel carries a sweet front into a bounce back and forth between light spicy notes, dry oak and more sweetness. Golden raisin.
Some saltiness in there. A bit of warmth in the chest, the lingering finish is the saltiness in some cardboard."
