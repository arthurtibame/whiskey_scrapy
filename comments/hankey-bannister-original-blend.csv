3.0,"In my goodie bag from the Inver House tasting last week was a little bottle of this. Now, there were two strikes against Hankey Bannister already - 1. It's a bit anticlimactic to go from tasting some of the best single malts I've ever had to a cheap, bottom shelf blended scotch, and 2. I can't think of anything connected with ""Mr. Hankey"" without images of a giant, anthropomorphized turd coming to mind first. Thanks, South Park. That said, I had to give this a try because...well, you're reading this. You'd have tried it, too. The nose is actually quite nice - chocolate covered banana, coconut, a little bit of lemon. The palate is, sadly, less dynamic than the nose, but hardly bad - light, sweet vanilla, a hint of chocolate, some toasted almond slivers (like what you'd put in a salad), less of the tropical fruits than the nose, but there's a distinct hint of pineapple on the otherwise short and unremarkable finish. It's not bad by any means - there are worse blends out there. But, I'm probably never going to rush home to pour myself a dram of this neat, either...maybe a great pick for making homemade Drambuie?"

4.0,"It's currently 86 proof now in USA, and I think it's spectacular! A good daily dram for sure."
4.0,"Nice sweetness and a pleasant metallic and earthy scent on the nose. Smooth warm honey and vanilla palate, a little fruit, strong tobacco finish. Nice mouthfeel. Better than some single malts I've tried and worth having a bottle in the bar, especially considering the price."

3.5,"I have been stocking up on my favorite Scotch and Irish whiskies before the 25% tariff boost goes in effect in three days. While I have been shopping I found this in 1.75 bottles on clearance for less than half price. Had already been curious about it; after all, it is rated in the first tier at Proof66, and Ralphy gave it an 86 mark---so I pulled the trigger. Their web site says it is a blend of Lowland grain whisky with a combination of Highland and Speyside malts. It is fruity, sweet, and spicy. It has a medium finish and is slightly astringent. I have no idea where it comes from, but I sometimes get a hint of iodine on the finish. There is no smoke in this dram. I found this to be an OK basic blended Scotch. In that category I would prefer Grant's Family Reserve (now Three Woods) or Highland Leader, but I think this is equal to the present day Famous Grouse, and is superior to Cutty Sark, Ballantine's, etc."
1.75,"Got this one served at a Thai air flight.
Very soft without any depth. Not alot of taste and no finish."

2.0,"Whisky number 8 of the recent batch of 12 affordable blends I’m rating.

Nose: Mild sherry backed up by reasonable oak, very noticeable grain component, a little malt, slight citrus and vanilla. Basically it has the aromas that a workhorse grain whisky can pull out of refill casks. It has a reasonably enveloping nose that reminds me a bit of JW Red Label, but it is warmer and softer.

Palate: A little bit of a let-down after the promising nose. Light cereal, malt, nuttiness, vanilla and some ""fruit"" of undetermined origin, but it's a little thin.

Finish: Medium with a tendency to turn sour/bitter/metallic as it fades.

Not a notable blended scotch until you add a dash of water and it suddenly blooms. The nose is reduced in intensity while the overall character stays the same, but the palate is much improved. Light honey sweetness is unlocked and the finish is also better, with the metallic/sourness morphing into a firm (but tired) oak influence.

It also works well with cola or soda but not quite as well with dry ginger. I was going to give this a grudging single star until I added water, which brings it up 2, just. Not what I'd call a great dram, but treated the right way it's acceptable.

""Acceptable"" : 2 stars"

3.0,I tasted it without knowing any thing about it. However I am impressed with the first slip and I particularly liked the wooden alorma.
