4.25,"The whiskey presented wonderfully in it's bottle, with hard edges and thick glass base. The taste was complex, ranging from sweet to peppery. My mouth and nose were left pleasantly smokey and peppery well after my glass was empty."

3.0,"I love this color!  I actually bought it for the color, but kept it for the taste.  It's bourbon-esque (is that a word), with a kick of rye.  If you like bourbon and rye, it's for you.  Not really comparable to Scottish single malts or blends at all.  Worth a try---but pricey , can get better value elsewhere"

5.0,"Solid finish.  Good, deep flavor.  Enjoyed at 30 hip in Cedar Rapids."

5.0,I went to the Hillrock Distillery and this instantly became my favorite whiskey.
3.0,"I don’t care for peat flavor in general really. This to its credit is not overpoweringly peaty. Interestingly they age the single malt in their own used bourbon barrels from the “nursery” batch that feeds the solera cycle. Finished two weeks in oloroso casks, 2 weeks in Pedro Jimenez casks and they malt their own barley grown on the farm."
5.0,"Very smooth with flavors of caramel, butterscotch, spices, and citrus. Has similar flavors to George t stagg."
