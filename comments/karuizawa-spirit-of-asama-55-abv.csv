3.0,"Tasted blind. Notes say: ""chocolate as fuck."""
5.0,"A blend of 1999 and 2000 vintages bottled in 2012 from 77 European Oak Sherry Casks. This is my first time ever trying a Karuizawa and it was very well worthy of the try with a nose of Chocolate, Toffee, Cherry, Sherry, Apricot, Floral, Apricot, Vanilla, and Almonds, a palate of Rum Raisins, Pepper, Chocolate, Hazlenuts, and Rubber, and a finish of Cherry, Chocolate, Raspberry, Pepper, Raisins, and Toasted Barley."
