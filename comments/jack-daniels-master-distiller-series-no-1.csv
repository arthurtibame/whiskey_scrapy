3.0,"A little sweeter and a little smokier than #7. If the two were the same price, I would pick this one first."

4.0,"Quite possibly the best Jack Daniels I have ever tasted. Unfortunately, it's been a while since I've had a glass but I remember it being much smoother than the Old No. 7. It's appropriate that Jack himself is honored with this bottling. My Favorite Jack. Glad I still have 2 unopened bottles. I bought my first bottle of this alongside a bottle of Sinatra Select. Maybe that's why I don't like the Sinatra Select."

3.5,Very smoky.  Shocking first taste and then mellows out on the rocks. This was Masters No 6.  It wasn't on the inventory.

3.0,"Definitely a step up from No.7. It's got the classic JD flavor, but this one is the smoothest I've tried. It's worth trying. 3.5/5"
