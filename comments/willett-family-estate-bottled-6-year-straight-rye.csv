4.0,"Barrel no 145, 58.6%.

Fantastic nose. Rich taste, spicy, slightly floral, deep. There's a slight paper note that's hard to place. But otherwise this is a fine whiskey. Well balanced. Unmistakably a rye. Very drinkable. 12/22/17"

4.75,"Cask #2251
Nose- Maple syrup, caramel, vanilla, spiced caramel, black pepper, cinnamon 

Palate- Buttered pancakes smothered in maple syrup, caramel, vanilla toffee, rye spice

Finish- Long, buttery, mouth coating finish notes of Maple syrup, black pepper, and caramel 

This is fantastic. Everything you could want from a rye. Buttery pancakes with maple syrup from the nose to finish. My only complaint is that the maple syrup can overpower some of the other delicious flavors. I need to track down a single barrel willett."
4.5,"Not sure which batch or proof this was at Radiator. Was off the shelf, not on the menu, at $28/Pour. Nose was spice and vanilla heavy. Palate was full and spice forward but rounded and deep in flavor. Finish was long. Had to be Willett stock. Flavor was extremely similar to my 4 year at home, just a bit deeper/richer."

I'm a little bit confused about the description saying it's MGP whiskey because what i had is definitely Willet's own distillate. Compared to the 4 year, the 6 is more refined and does not taste as the younger brother. It would be nice to see more older batches from them."

4.75,"Neat.  5 year.  DEPs pick.  Hint of dill and very rye forward on the nose.  Layers of vanilla and apple.  Pepper notes.  A tad darker notes than the 4 year off memory.

Thick, syrupy, coating mouth feel.  A bit vicious even. Brown sugar, maple and pepper on the tongue.  Wow.  Blast of honey with vanilla and rye on the taste.  Fabulous legs.  Maple and honey sweetness left lingering in the mouth surround by the rye spices.  

Oh my.  The nose was a let down.  Very pedestrian, basic rye.  The taste and legs are amazing flavor bombs.  Lights up all parts of the mouth with these amazing g flavors.  Floored by these flavors.  Great pick DEPs."
