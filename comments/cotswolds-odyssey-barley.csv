4.0,"An english single malt, something that doesn't come close too often. It is as standard as a whisky can be, and that is not a bad thing in this case.

This one is called 2014 Odyssey Barley, and it comes from locally grown barley in the cotswolds hills in England.

Bottled at 46%abv, with an amber color.

On the nose, pretty aromatic. Oranges, Malted barley, Rice, Candied oranges; Ginger. Candied fruits aroma. Yellow apples. After first sip, green apples appear and hints of Honey.

On the palate, it is a little dull. Spicy, pepper, Red fruits, Oranges and Syrup.

Aftertaste gets a little better, with a light tobacco note; hay; a raw rice overall feeling. Spicy pepper.

Overall this is a good dram. Maybe an everyday whisky. Very easy drinkable, the higher abv helps it to have clean flavors and aromas, but it is as standard as a whisky can be. 80 over 100, for a 4yo dram, it is a good deal."
4.25,"The Cotswolds distillery was established in 2014, becoming the first full-scale distillery in the history of the area. Using only locally grown barley which is then floor malted, the spirit is then matured in first-fill ex-Bourbon barrels and reconditioned red wine casks. 

Dramfest 2020. I was really impressed with these guys. They do really good stuff at a fair price. Very oily and flavorful."
