3.0,"My tasting from bottle No. 134 of 658 from cask #30. Distilled 18/11/1996, bottled 17/4/2015.
  
  Nose: Very cereal-led with aromas of oatmeal, yeast, fermenting wort (almost like beer) and brown bread. Some sherry is noticeable and a little oak, also light caramel and brown sugar. There is, however, an intrusive rubbery aroma like old tyres that spoils an otherwise clean profile.
  
  Palate: The arrival is full, oily and led by cereal flavours (sourdough bread and porridge) but it’s not gristy or bright – these are long-cooked (overcooked?) grains. There is an earthy quality to the palate and a phenolic note, but it’s not actually smoky. I think it’s the palate sensation of the rubbery note in the nose.
  
  Finish: Short, and again mainly cereal.
  
  For a whisky of this age that was matured in a sherry butt (even if it was refill) this has a strikingly young character. On one hand it’s very spirit-driven and crisp but on the other there is a constant note of synthetic rubber weaving through it. I can’t help but think that this was put into second-tier casks that were rather tired, and consequently maturation hasn’t quite given the distillate the sort of polish and depth it required – just a layer of “age”.
  
  A dash of water brings out some sweetness and a little ashy smoke, but it’s entirely optional and doesn’t reveal any sort of hidden depths. It was OK overall, but judged in comparison on both quality and cost it’s not one I’d recommend.

  Tasted at The Oak Barrel, Sydney CBD, 22 May 2017.

  “Above Average” : 3 stars"
