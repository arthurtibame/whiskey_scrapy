4.0,"The beauty and challenge of independent bottlings is that you get distinct variations of your officially bottled, well-known Single Malt. On the nose, Gordon & MacPhail's 2004 Caol Ila is very briny, featuring seaweed, oysters and mineral peatiness. Honeydew melon, pickles and a touch of burned rubber lurk in the back. Sweet and sour, lightly peated and punchy aromatic flavors dominate the taste before the medium-length finish fades with over-brewed tea, salted cucumbers and white pepper. A rewarding, charismatic and notably salty experience!

4.0,"On our trip last year to Scotland, we found this bottle at a supermarket chain called Co-Op.  Which begs the question: do the Scottish seriously get to enjoy high-quality, independent bottlings of some of the best distilleries in the country, simply by going to their everyday grocery stores?

This whiskey's most prominent scents include vanilla and white fruit such as pear or white peach.  It's also surprisingly floral at times, although its Islay heritage reveals itself in a healthy dose of brine.  There is some peat, but it lingers on the edges, imparting a faint minerality.  Key lime pie is an unexpected revelation on the palate of this mellow, easy-drinking whisky.  Its predominant flavors are sweet or dessert-like: vanilla, butter, and honey.  Like all coastal Islay whiskies, seaspray and brine add a pleasing, seasoned character to each sip.  The peat is subtle on the finish and expresses itself as aromatic woodsmoke and salted butter."

Reminds me of being at the beach ( or down the shore, as we NJ folks call it).  Thanks to @Dreaming-of-Islay for the pour!  Really well made."
