3.0,"No brand seems to have more enthusiasm for no-age-statement, hard-to-pronounce whiskies than Highland Park.  Pretty soon, the distillery will exhaust the canon of Norse mythology and have to move onto Hindu deities, where they will not run out of new names for young scotch anytime soon.   Valkyrie is a good, peaty, young scotch, kind of in line with a young Benromach I recently tried.  Apple, smoke, a distinct boozy edge, and buttered toast defined the nose for me.  It tastes like a classic Highland Park, with a well-balanced mixture of sweet, spicy, and salty, with more sherry expressed in the palate and finish.  A Highland peat, pine-like smoke complements these flavors at the end.  For an $80 single malt, it’s too young for my tastes and isn’t as good as Highland Park 12 or 15."

3.0,"At a business dinner this evening, I noticed this at the bar.   I had to wonder---was this good enough to carry forward the HP brand, or  would  it simply exemplify their pushing more NAS with fancy Viking stories in lieu of good quality aged versions?  At $17 / ounce,  I thought it was outrageously priced (and we can't expense in alcohol despite it being a business dinner).  Nose is smoked orchard fruits like apples and peaches.  Palette---toffee, spice, some salinity and a wrapper of peat.  It can't hold a candle against the 18, and it pales in comparison to even the 12.  This is young.  I'm glad I tried it out first, not sure I'd buy a bottle, at least when I can do better with the 12.  On a side note, I did notice this had a  screw on cork.  The liquid was simply ""meh"", but I have to admit, pretty fancy bottling and corking.  Unfortunately, I'm  not iin favor of replacing good quality liquid for  fancy bottles and cork tops."

3.0,"Nose is milder than anticipated, but pleasant. Not as intense as the Dark Origins. Makes me think toffee/caramel with the some peat (it was light for me, but I drink Laphroaig every other day). 
        
        On the palate, it's less chocolaty than the Dark Origins, but more sherry/malt influenced. Got some nuts and cream in there too. To me, the finish almost had a very light espresso/coffee with slight alcohol. I liked this more than the Dark Origins as well, so I see why they went with this as a replacement.  It is an enjoyable glass, but I wish the finish was less alcohol burn influenced.  As a side note, I will pop a couple drops of water to see if it helps. I think it did help with that.. hmm, limit to literally two or three droplets though.
        
        For the price of 80ish bucks though, I think I'd rather get the Ardbeg Oogie, just sayin' =)  73 W3AAX"

4.0,"Nose: Smokey but not with the medicinal peat, notes of brownie, roasted coffee, strawberries, walnuts, dark chocolate, oranges, créme brûlée and pears. Unexpected desert, my favorite.
Palette, peated, but with the that same fruity acidic freshness and creamed coating that mellows everything back down. Citrus and pears mostly dominate, then peat and oak lingers for a while and goes to a lightly salty finish."

4.0,"This Highland Park had to grow on me. When I first cracked the seal a few months ago I would've rated it 3 stars but I've come to appreciate it more and more. The peat is closer to a peated speyside than an islay. It's heavy on the spice and oak rather than salt or iodine. The dried fruit and shortcake notes take a backseat to Oriental spice and oak influence, leading to a long drying finish. I give it four stars because it is a unique flavor profile in my whisky collection but I don't think it justifies the ~$70 price tag. I'd rather get the Magnus for half the price."

3.0,"Nose - Dark apple/pear cider, subtle sweet nutty fruit, dried low sugar dates, very light brine and wisp of smoke.

Taste - Buttery/creamy malt, hint of dried apples, dull muted smoke, light salted/brined sour apples, hint of dried jujubes, dry spongy fruit flesh sweet, light fruity bitter.

Finish - Lingering faint fruity sweet, light sea spray, light smoke, lingering jujube subtle sweetness.

Score - 78/100

Final Thoughts - This had a great nose off the initial pour and develops with a bit of air time in the glass. Unfortunately that's about the only place where this shines as it is tasty on the palate, but the combination of flavors you get on the tongue versus the nose is a bit confusing. You get more sweetness on the nose, but on the palate it tastes like a dried out powdery apple that has lost most of its sweetness & crunch. Sadly similar to a dry tasting jujube, where it's still sweet, but barely, and you get more spongy air filled sweetness. The subtle wisp of smoke & brine are nice and do help balance it out a bit. I feel this is something best enjoyed on a fresh palate as it's quite subtle.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

5.0,After spending some time with this scotch I have to say it's really nice. it's a decent amount of smoke. Not ardbeg 10 smoke but still a good amount. After sitting with it and enjoying it I find it has a slight sweetness and a nice dark chocolate finish that I really like. the smoke is kinda meaty and I like that too. I wouldn't say its the most challenging but it is very enjoyable!

3.0,"It's complicated! Compared to other Highlands, it's too smokey. Compared to other Highland Parks, it's right on par! Compared to the smoke of an Islay, it's lacking. Over all, it's pretty well-balanced. In comparison to the HP 12 year, its apples and oranges, but I'd take the 12 any day over this one!...but then again, I wouldn't turn this down if someone poured it for me! See?!?! It's complicated!!!"
null,"September 6th 2018 at the Irish Heather in Vancouver. $14 an ounce. Served in a tasting glass. Big fruity sweet and peaty nose. The peat is understated. This is not Lagavulin 16. Not intense but delicate and complex. In summary it's a damn nice nose. The mild peat makes it more interesting than the average fruity scotch whiskey. Sweet and fruity on the palate. Trace of smoke on the palate. Definitely more interesting and complex on the nose than on the palate. I don't have a control whiskey for comparison, but I think this is punching over its weight price wise. Actually my control just arrived and it's HP 18. I think this compares very favorably with the 18. I think the extra 6% alcohol makes it punchier. A very nice dram for two thirds the price of the 18."

Very long dark chocolate and salt finish, quite an unusual expression of Highland Park.  I prefer the more typical character of honey and heather from Highland Park 12, but this is an interesting and curious whiskey.  Quite tannic."

This is actually pretty great - I think that I prefer the 12 in flavor and price, but this us a nice whiskey... it also has a strawberry flavor which blows my mind, because it's something I've never found in all the many whiskeys that I've tried.  It does have a green herby finish with some dark chocolate hints."

4.25,Супер аромат! Остро с пикантен вкус.
3.75,"Nose: You get the typical Highland Park profile with tons of delicious red apples, nutmeg, cinnamon and very slight cardamom. In the back, you have some custard and angel's food cake. Some light smoke and ash are present. I find that the ash (not the smoke) clashes a bit weirdly.

Palate: Powerful taste with the red apples and raisins, a strong spicy punch with a ton of cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom and general oak spice. The spices are much more present than the smell let on. The custard and angel's food cake like notes I've picked are still there with the egg-like flavors being more present than in the smell. A little salty. Again, the smoke and ash are there, not being the biggest fan of the ash. 

Mouthfeel: Medium body with some oiliness. Nothing out of the ordinary here.

Finish: Smoky, spicy, vanilla custard, light chocolate and a little salty. Longer than expected and maybe the highlight of this dram. 

Overall: This is a very nice fruity and smoky whisky. You get quite a bit of oak spice from the older whiskies in this ""blend"" and some edginess from the younger ones. This is powerful whisky that feels a bit higher proof than what it is. Still, I find the ash a bit distracting and would have score this a bit higher if it weren't for that."
4.25,"Color: Gentle gold

Nose: Green apple, red berries (raspberry), lemon, vanilla, smoke, peat, dark chocolate, and oak wood.

Palate: Spicy, vanilla, black licorice, ginger, nutty, and oaky.

Finish: Long and lingering, spicy, smoky, and fruity."

5.0,"I think this is one of the most interesting drams i have ever tasted. It is not necessarily the best whisky, but it is amazing.

Bottled at 45.9% abv with a deep gold color.

Remember i once told you that Highland Park has the best marketing in their bottles? This is no exception. The name ""Valkyrie"" comes from nordic ""angels"" that comb the battlefields to pick up the best dead warriors and let them enter the Viking heaven called ""Valhalla"". How do you like that story?

Well, the dram is a battlefield also. 

The nose is simply overwhelming, with an inmense peaty note, like a fireplace or a barbecue, roasted meat nose appear, some balsamic oil and salt. Spectacular.

On the palate is very oily, i think is a young whisky but the flavor is intense. Lots of spices: pepper, liquorice, a bitter note, ashes, hard blocks of salt, full mouth sensation.

The finish is very long, it burns your insides, ashes, bonfire, gunpowder. Amazing.

Overall i give this dram a 99/100 and the point deduction comes from the burn sensation in the aftertaste letting me know this whisky is young, i wonder what would happen with a little more maturation. Amazing. Slainte!"

4.0,"As a follow-up to my HP Valknut review, I've got here a review of its predecessor, the Valkyrie. My experience with the Valknut was interesting. Loved it when I cracked it. Disliked it when I reviewed it initially, though I was sick. Re-reviewed and found out it was above average. Interesting.

Now I've got entry #1 in what I'm calling the ""Valk series."" I've had a much more consistent experience with them. I have no idea how much of the bottle I've worked through thanks to the opaque black bottle, but judging by the weight I'd say I'm about midway through.

Nose: Creamy custard and sherry notes like cranberry, orange, raisin, fig, date, and apricot. Caramel and vanilla, with a bit of sulfur. Some toffee and a bit of sea salt. Low on the smoke and peat, though there is a slight maritime quality.

Palate: Plenty of sulfur, cranberry, apricot, and orange. Toffee, caramel, vanilla, and milk chocolate. Once again, a bit of sea salt. Background peat. HP claims this is above average ppm, and while I detect a bit, I'd have guessed the opposite. Instead I get a cross between dry red fruit, citrus fruit, and a bit of dessert sweetness. A bit of cinnamon and baking spice heat.

Finish: A touch of smoke followed some dry fruit and milk chocolate. All cinnamon and pepper for the duration of a short-moderate finish.
*I'm back roughly a half a year later. Toward the bottom of the bottle. The notes are similar but the length of the finish is much greater. Adds some orange, apricot, and peach notes. Moderate-to-long. Much more exaggerated notes and punch, in a good way.

Overall, I'd say it's a solid NAS Scotch. Worth $80? Eh. Not really. But it's well-balanced, and plenty interesting. HP played it straight with this one unlike the risky and somewhat volatile Valknut. This one made less of an impact than the latter, but I give it points for consistency. I think the two expressions are, ultimately, equal, for very different reasons.

I'll be buying the Valkfather to compare. The ""Valk Series"" is in no way exceptional but I do find it compelling for some reason. Not exactly a glowing review, I know. But there is a lot to like here. HP gets a lot of flack for the Viking theme and the prolific of output of subpar NAS products. This one does not fall into that category.

This one was hard to review. I may have to come back to this one. Conclusion? My rating perfectly matches the Distiller user average of 3.75. Good but not great. Glad we're in agreement on this one.
*Bumped up to 4 flat roughly a half a year later due to the improvement to the finish. Strong nose, dips a bit on the palate, and comes roaring back on the finish."
