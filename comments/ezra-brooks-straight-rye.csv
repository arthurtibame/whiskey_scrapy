3.75,"Neat in a glencairn.  Golden yellow-orange hue with surprising viscosity and some legs.  The nose confirms the 51% rye + high corn mash (Distiller entry is wrong - not LDI rye, it's one of the newer MGP rye bills).  Gentle and sweet with prominent apple juice, a splash of maple syrup, some dusty cereal grain chaff, and dried chili pepper.  Herbal tones stay on the periphery.  Mild but approachable.

The palate is a bit more demanding and punchy up front, but not harsh, and then mellows nicely with a lasting sweetness.  Creamy but muted on the tongue, the flavors hide until after the swallow.  A few fumes and a flash of heat way in the back, then toasted sugar, honey, and bitter grapefruit peel.  Stewed apples.  Surprised when it occurred to me, but shares some kinship with a number of blended Scotches, albeit with a few things turned up to 11 (this is a young rye, after all, and unabashedly American despite trying to make my point with a Spinal Tap reference about a British metal band).

I like this.

It cost me $11.

I like this A LOT for $11.

Thank you Lux Row & MGP.  Rittenhouse, Sazerac, or Old Fo' Rye are incremental upgrades, mostly in complexity and a touch of proof, but they are an additional 10 to 20 bones.  I like this better than more $30-$40 bottles (that I own!) than I'd care to admit.  An easy entry into the VFM knockout rounds at that price."
3.25,Despite being a 95% Rye mash bill from Indiana (insert MGP) this did not hit very hard Rye notes in any area. Perhaps it was the youthful nature or the low proof but this was only “Ok”. It’s not a great sipper and not really worth the effort as a mixer when others can be found for same price.

3.5,"Nose is pretty muted, like the volume is toned down on the rye. It’s remarkably sweet and the rye spiciness is more of a backbone harmony to the composition. Ends with the spiciness and oak. Good sipper and very approachable."
2.0,"A very mild rye. Might be good as a mixer or someone new to drinking whiskey neat but, more experienced rye drinkers will want to look elsewhere."

3.0,"Pretty solid for the price paid ($18) but it's a bit hot and messy. The initial nose is fantastic, but after sitting and opening up for a bit, those wonderful rye notes (mint, anise, dill) start to fade and give way to the young and unrefined nature of this whiskey, resulting in a strong alcoholic presence that overwhelms the palate. The mouthfeel is also fairly thin. Would love to try this one side by side with Dickel Rye for comparative purposes. Unlike its Bourbon counterparts (Ezra 90 proof and 7 year 101), this one doesn't really punch above its price point. For a sub-$20 bottle of MGP-sourced Rye though, it won't leave you disappointed."

3.0,"Nose: Rye bread, dill, black licorice, clove, and if you close your eyes and try really hard you can pick up the faintest hint of vanilla. Neat: salty and savory, light oak astringency, a jolt of black pepper spice, and if you close your eyes and try really hard you can pick up the faintest hint of vanilla. Finishes slightly astringent with a clingy coating of the black pepper spice. Despite the clingy finish, overall the mouthfeel is relatively thin. Splash: adds a touch of sweetness and calms the mid palate jolt of spice. Verdict? This one needs more time in the barrel to impart some sweetness. While not the biggest fan of MGP's 95/5 ryes, I do enjoy several of them (Bulleit, Dickel and James Pepper). This one is only saved from a 2 star rating by its sub-$20 price tag. I do feel that this one will more than suffice as a mixer. If I want a 95/5 that I can drink neat, I'll chip in the extra $5-$10 and get the Dickel, Pepper or Bulleit...or simply opt for a bottle of Rittenhouse."

3.5,"Appearance: The color in this rye whiskey is a beautiful dark caramel color. Thin very viscous legs cling to the glass interior like a mynock clings to a Corellian freighter.

Nose: The nose begins with a sweet greeting that quickly fades into more dominant notes of licorice, brown sugar, and Nilla Wafers. After letting it breathe a bit a note of leather, and a smell similar to that of walking through a damp forest enter in as well. By adding a splash of water the complexity dies and a boring sweeter note takes over.

Taste: The palate starts with Whoppers chocolate malt ball candy, followed by cereal grains, and a cherry note ending with some heat and spice. There is a rich oily body in the whiskey, but the taste starts off great and to me it then seems to drop and dissipate. Like going down a seemingly exhilarating slide then reaching the bottom way too soon. (I like their creative addition of charcoal filter/mellowing however that may have stripped some of the flavor from the whiskey.) Adding a splash of water, like with the nose, tones down what little variety was present and leaves behind just the familiar rye spiciness.

Finish: The finish starts with a hot bite at first, but then it transitions into a pleasant downhill ride into a medium long almost malty finish.

Thoughts: From my experience so far, this a really nice rye and whiskey in general. The higher proof does it justice and adding water definitely makes it boring. Though the palate could use a few more fireworks in my opinion, this is a phenomenal whiskey for the price! I do recommend it, and wouldn’t mind buying it again. Luxco, thanks for your quality Ezra Brooks whiskeys! Cheers!"

3.5,"After non stop running around most of the weekend I am happy to finally sit down, unwind and watch some football!! Bought this Rye for $9.89 (WinCo Foods minus a $2 coupon on the neck of the bottle) so really had zero expectations for it but boy am I impressed... 

This Rye is distilled by MGP using their 95/5 Rye Mashbill. It's a Straight Rye so we know it's at least 2 years old. It's also charcoal mellowed like all Ezra Brooks Whiskeys. The bottle is not the most attractive but the fact you get a natural cork on a sub $10 is pretty impressive! Let's dive in...

On the palette it's pretty rich and sweet upfront... Toffee, apples and vanilla with spices being a fast follow... Cinnamon and clove with a hint of dill but definitely not as Dilly as most MGP Rye... This carries thru the finish that's an impressive medium length and has a nice spice kick. Really smooth all the way thru.

This maybe the best value in Rye on the market!! For the price paid, and the fact is perfectly enjoyable neat is really impressive! Definitely something I'll keep on hand for Rye cocktails and when I want a sweet and simple Rye!! 

Cheers All!!"

3.75,"Very unique flavor... it's got a brassy, honey taste, along with vanilla and a little bit of spicyness at the end.  To me it almost tastes like an Irish.  Very enjoyable, does just fine on it's own in a glass and stands up to ice really well.   Got this for 15 USD where I live, amazing value, will definitely add this to my bar."

This my friends of my type of rye, it trips me out at the subtleness of the spice that this rye brings to the palate. 
It is complex to the nose and to the palate it is very enjoyable as a toned down rye.
For your traditional rye drinker this might not be your ticket in the way of a rye as the spice is subdued, because of that toned down rye I find the beverage to be most enjoyable neat and very neat at that!
While looking through the bottom of your glass or bottle please do it responsibly!
Buy someone (a stranger) a beverage and tell them... CH33RS!!!"
