2.0,"An interesting bourbon. The nose is sweet leather with a floral quality to it, but the whiskey is spicy, pepper, clove and an almost astringent tinge to it on the palate. Still it had a smooth mouthfeel and a light lingering finish. I personally didn't feel these factors played well together, though it is a unique offering that I can't compare to any other bourbon I've tried. Worth a dram, but I wouldn't find much use for an entire bottle."

5.0,Old leather and wood on the nose. That nose transfers straight into the front of the taste with big leathery notes that glide into a hot allspice and vanilla swell followed by a smooth but slightly tannic dark chocolate. Beautiful and well balanced bourbon. A personal favorite.

5.0,"Best whiskey I've had, did blind tastings of 25+ whiskies over the course of a few weeks and this emerged as the winner.  A little smoke, leather and musty for the age and some baking spice on the palate, I could drink just this from now on."
