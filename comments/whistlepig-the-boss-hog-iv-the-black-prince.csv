5.0,"PRICE: $400-800.  The suggested retail is $500.  Some stores do have it on shelf for less, some still try to mark up an already high price.
  INFO: Indiana rye whiskey distilled at MGP, barrel aged for 14 years, and finished in French casks that once contained Armagnac.  This is bottled barrel-strength at 59.6% ABV.  This won best whisk(e)y in the world at the 2017 San Francisco World Spirits Competition.
  
  NOSE: 96/100.  Bottomless complexity.  Definitely fruit forward, but the rye spices are not quiet either.  I’ve tried the 3rd Boss Hog, The Independent, which was aged in ex-Macallan casks, and the rye was really shut out by the scotch.  Since then, WhistlePig has changed the source to MGP rye, which is definitely standing up firmer than Alberta rye.  There’s plums, toffee, molasses on top; dark, dark, sweet, rich stuff.  Underneath, white grapes and Bartlett pears; vibrant and juicy stuff.  Deeper still, are the herbs: dill and mint.
  
  PALATE: 98/100.  Huge breathtaking explosion of fruit on the arrival that on my first try literally made my eyes bulge.  I am instantly reminded of one of my white whales I finally got to try this year: Bruichladdich Black Art 4.  But this is even better.  Full disclosure: I don’t like strong American ryes yet.  I’m trying to develop the appreciation, like someone new to peat might take a while to appreciate Laphroaig 10.  Rye is a mere passenger in this bottle, which may upset traditionalists, but I am more than fine with that.  In fact, somehow by combining aged rye with Armagnac, there are flavors from almost every other spirit here.  There’s a fruity Speyside scotch in here, dark sugars and molasses of rum, roasted cactus of mezcal, caramel and cinnamon of bourbon, and the green herbaciousness of rye.  There’s a Christmas baking element to it; and there’s a Christmas tree, pinecones and all, element to it.  The intensity is turned up to a thousand, but you don’t get any burn, and this does not need any water to enjoy. 
  
  FINISH: 97/100.  Long, satisfying finish, that is wood-dominant, but has great complexity.  I am reminded of roasting marshmellows impaled on a Maplewood twig on an open campfire.  Crème brulee.  Flowery essential oils.  Apricots.  And the gentlest amount of peppers and pine needles.
  
  OVERALL: This is my whisky of the year.  Black Prince translated to the fine dining world would be like Eleven Madison Park.  If you like something traditional, like grandma’s lasagna, you’re not going to get it there.  But you’ll get something new, bold, and yet honest enough to win over a curmudgeon like me.  It’s aged 14 years and costs $500.  Why?  Because Armagnac casks are expensive and hard to find.  Plus it tastes great, is an experience you cannot find in any other bottle, and is presented elegantly.  Conveniently, it also prices the bourbon flippers out of the picture, and you actually find this on a shelf.  
  
  MARK: 97/100.
  VALUE FOR MONEY: I paid $480 for my bottle, and was previously paying $55 per ounce at a bar.  Whether or not you think it’s worth it paying that much to have a whiskey better than any other one you’ve had all year is a matter of how much you make, and how much of it you are willing to spend on a dram, isn’t it?
  
  MY RUNNERS UP (i.e. what Black Prince beat): to qualify, this had to be a whisk(e)y that I tried for the first time in 2017 (not necessarily released in 2017).
  1) Yamazaki 18 year
  2) Longrow Red 12 year Pinot Noir finish
  3) Bruichladdich Black Art 4.1
  4) Octomore 7.3 Islay Barley
  5) Cadenhead 1984/2013 Caol Ila 29 year"
5.0,Rye in the nose... but the flavor is very bold and complex. Very finish. Enjoyed this one a lot. Would be great on cold night by a fire.
5.0,"$550

Nose surprised me at first as it didn't smell like anything mainstream, but after the 1st sniff I started getting notes of oak, caramel, vanilla, spices, apricots, burnt sugar. Very satisfying and complex as well. On the palate so delicious and smooth yet having a very bold taste with hints of oak, nuts, fruit, and sugar. Very long finish of that burnt sugar again. Is it worth $500, well not much is but to me it's worth it because it not only tastes good but more importantly it's different than anything I've had before as well. That pewter top is also a great collectors item :) on a serious note though it really does have a complex nose, palate, and finish that lasts which to me makes a great whiskey.

Well it didn't take me long to have another pour this afternoon after a very long day because I wanted to see if the hype was still there. And guess what this keeps getting better. On the finish I noticed there's a nice mild peppercorn spice to it, not the normal in your face spice that a lot of whiskeys share. Really digging this. Going to pick up another bottle because this isn't going to last me long."

Though, given the asinine price, I have a feeling Bhakta & Co. are laughing at us pretty heartily. I would pay up to $60 and my wife said she would go as high as $30."

5.0,"Nose starts with sharp alcohol but transitions to black cherry, burnt caramel and sweet pipe tobacco. Sweet and invigorating.

Taste follows almost exactly, sweet with additional notes of vanilla and a slightly toasty peppery alcohol finish. Warming but only a faint burn. Very nice."

5.0,"I decided to buy myself an early birthday present and so here we are. 
    
    I cannot understate how beautiful the color of this whiskey is. When I think of the color ""amber"" this is exactly what I expect. I also cannot understate how heavy the pewter topper is on this thing. 
    
    Anyways. Wow. This is genuinely unlike anything else I have ever tried in any whiskey category and I feel any distillary would be hard pressed to mimic it unless they too had some Armagnac casks laying around. When you think of this as a rye (which it is) you think major spice but the balance of the Armagnac (brandy) barrels really balances this out into something special. I had to hunt for it but the MGP dill and mint is present on the nose adding another layer of nuance to this insanely well done rye. This just hits the rich, sweet, fruity, spicy flavors all at once. 
    
    Is it worth the price of admission? That's your call. If you can go in with some friends to split a bottle, do it (and trust the one storing it) or buy a dram if you can find it at a watering hole.

1.0,"Luckily a friend bought this bottle and we tried it together as it is not worth $500 nor is it worth more than a $60 bottle. My friend and I both agreed that he wasted his money on this and a  regular Sazerac bottle for $30 is of better overall taste. 

We were also tasting my Blanton's gold at the time so there was no question Blanton's was way better as well.

Don't believe the hype as it's not worth the cost! Buy or try Thomas Handy Sazerac or 3 Kentucky Owls if your going to spend the same cost!"
5.0,"My absolute fave. 

Often times people would say oh this is not my top or there are better bottles that only cost this much and so on and so forth. I respect their opinion but it does not determine/affect my own personal taste and neither it should for anyone else. 

Having said that, I purchased this bottle despite the steep price because of how everything about it screams special in connection to my own personal life. For that alone, its value already weighs as heavy as gold. And I know that whenever I'll take a sip, all the wonderful memories will come rushing back. 

So special bottles should have other qualities besides the superb nose/taste if they command such prices. This edition of boss hog hits everything FOR ME perfectly."

3.5,"I'd give this a 4.0+ for taste, knocked back for the crazy MSRP.

I gave this very high marks when I tried it at the SF Whiskey Fest in 2017. I've had it a couple of times since then, and it stands up well when it's the only CS rye of a lineup... but when you start comparing it head to head with other rich ryes, it loses some steam.

I did this side-by-side with the Booker's Rye, and it was clear the Booker's is head and shoulders above the Black Price. (Freudian slip on the typo, but decided to leave it.)"

4.5,"After adding a single ice cube, previously we had attempted to sample the black Prince and were decidedly unimpressed.

Smells heavily of sweet notes, primarily fruit based with spice, but bound together with inequitable sweet notes.

Tastes were tempered and refined greatly with the addition of the ice chip. It is now sweeter and more rounded. There is much more fruit notes bound together with black tea, spice and citrus, truely a taste for a Prince.

4.75,"Nose- Big, bold rye spice; Kit-Kat candy bar; coconuts; fresh baked bread; bananas; wood spice; hint of maple syrup

Palate- Initial wave of aged, funky oak; baking spices; cinnamon; rich vanilla; cherries; polished saddle leather; herbaceous/earthy notes near the end

Finish- Long, spicy yet mouth coating finish; Baking spices; dark fruits (plums, red grapes); earthy with a hint of barrel char


Great stuff. Nose is the highlight of this rye. Big, bold rye spices, but delicate at the same time, with an unmistakable note of Kit-Kats and tropical fruits. The palate is a tidal wave of flavors. Funky, aged oak, vanilla, baking spices, the list goes on and on. Very enjoyable. The finish is long as well, with just the right amount of a drying factor, while still coating the mouth in rye goodness. This is an expensive bottle, there’s no way around it, but with the juice inside, bottle design, and if money isn’t a big issue, I recommend you grab one."

4.75,"This is a amazing tasting rye and is it worth the 499.00 price tag no but I was able to trade up and get this beautiful dram. Here is my review that on my Facebook Group I run call What it’s titled

“Whiskey 🥃 Grilling Time Review!”

“WHISTLEPIG THE BOSS HOG IV: THE BLACK PRINCE REVIEW!”

Best of Show San Francisco World Spirits Competition 17’ 

Taste Note:

""The nose reveals warming spices, with cinnamon, oak, rye bread, and spearmint. The palate slowly starts spicy, delivering the potent punch of its high proof. What follows is brown sugar and crème brûlée, with a medicinal and herbal organic taste, almost savory, background with a hint of smoke. A dash or two of water tames the beast and delivers more of its vanilla sweetness. This is a  finish is long, with char, spicy oak, and vanilla.""

This hit all the points of a G.O.A.T. whiskey 🥃 

“A full belly, a heavy hog, and a light of luck!”
Cheers!"

4.5,"Nose: the entire candy shop. Baked sugar, confectioners sugar, all of the sweets. Mild hotness, expected at 118pf.

Palate: yeah there's the sugar. Mild citrus (mild grapefruit, orange zest), stone from of tree nuts (??). 

Finish: light alcohol, white sugar, smooth as can be. Lingers around until a fading finish, desires to be drank further.

Would have rated a 5* if not for the price - buying this at $200 all day, can't justify the $500 cost."
