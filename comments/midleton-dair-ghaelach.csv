4.75,"Tree #7

Nose- Fresh oak; espresso beans; orange rind; milk chocolate; baked apples; mango jam

Palate- Initial wave of pot still spice, quickly washed over by creamy vanilla; orange creamsicles; espresso; tobacco; honey; aged oak

Finish- Long, creamy finish; pot still spices; creamy orange; vanilla; dark roast coffee 


What a complex dram. Initially, the ethanol dominated the nose, but after 3-5 minutes, the nose becomes beautiful. Espresso beans, chocolate, oranges, and fresh mango jam wash over the nose. The palate has some great pot still spices, an unmistakable note of orange creamsicles, vanilla, and honey. The finish is long as it gets, with dark roast coffee, more pot still spices, with orange to round it out. Great stuff, and definitely in the upper echelon of irish whiskies."

5.0,"Absolutely incredible. Very complex, quite a lot of pepper spicyness with an intense oak flavor like nothing else I have ever drank. It really does open up with a few drops of water, and eases off the high alcohol heat. A slight aftertaste of baby sick comes through but it is somehow very enjoyable. I absolutely love this whiskey."
