3.0,Oak and vanilla aroma. Strong smoke  with some spice. Oily. Vanilla comes through the oak notes. Smooth and easy with a moderate tea finish.

3.0,"A pleasant nose with notes of apricot, vanilla and almond.  The full round body gives way to nice warmth and soft lingering oaky finish."

2.25,"Tasted chilled bottle, neat.  Wasn't terribly exciting.  At this price point, though: you cannot expect the whiskey to end all whiskies.  Probably won't be purchasing again."

3.25,"Nose: heavy on the oak, with fresh fruit underneath; apples, pears, some floral notes
Palate: slightly sweet, chewy, fruits and peppercorns
Finish: medium length, warming, light oak"

2.5,"Nose: light fruitiness, crisp orchard fruits, Light sweetness, hint of honey, mildest of a floral garden note, oak barrel notes, may get some vanilla, fairly simple and straight forward. Taste: light fruit, spice notes, grassy notes, slight bitterness, finishes a little hot and lingers some, not the greatest but may please some palates more."

2.5,"Slight wood, smoke with a finish of spiced pear. Drinkable but not impressionable."
4.0,"Grangestone is a line of Scotches under the Spirits Direct tag for Total Wine.  Although the label states ""Highland"", I believe this is Kininvie, a Speyside in the William Grant & Sons Portfolio.  This has nice notes of fruit, honey, floral, and spice on the nose, with fruit and oak spice balanced on the finish.  Nice for the price, and a higher ABV would help.  My score was 84"
2.25,"Not bad, but not for me. Had some complexity to keep it interesting enough.  I taste a subtle hint of tobacco (not smoke) which is interesting, but not really a flavor I enjoyed."
3.5,"Light peat smoke and stone fruit on the nose and palate, there's also a hint of orange on the palate, the finish is medium length and reprises the peat smoke and stone fruit. Quite delicious, wish I had more, but only bought a 50ml taster."

2.5,Strong notes of vanilla and some floral pinnings
2.0,"Nose: floral, alcohol 
Taste: pear, little burn, not much else
Finish: hot, very short 
Glad i only purchased the 50ml bottle. 
For a 12yr and the price point is $33USD, there are many better 12yr scotch around this price."
3.0,"Nose: Floral
Palate: incredibly thin, with a little wood and a little spice
Finish: a small bit of heat

Overall disappointing, even at a cheap price"

2.0,"I don't recognize the nose. Apples, spice. Burns the lips. Ok."
2.75,"Light yellow color. The floral notes in the aroma take the lead with some oak in the background.slightly sweet at first, but yields to bitterness and some grassy notes. Some oak, spice and smoke notes as well. Finishes a bit more bitter than I would like. I feel like a little more age would serve this Scotch well."

3.0,"Nose: Chocolate and raisins. Some peat notes blending beautifully. Slightly grassy. A little bit of vanilla sneaking in.

Palate: Bold and firm off the bat. Some fruitiness as well as the chocolate. Vanilla stinger here. Some cereal flavor as well.

Finish: Medium. Sweetness blending with some spice as well making the finish smooth as well as bold. A very full flavor.

Overall Thoughts: I was impressed as well as pleasantly surprised! Very smooth and very flavorful. It’s not overpowering in any way. It starts off sweet on the nose and presents a full-bodied flavor that exceeds the expectations. I’d buy a small bottle just to keep in the cabinet for the occasional sip."
