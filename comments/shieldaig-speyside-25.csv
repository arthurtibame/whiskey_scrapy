5.0,"Absolutely fantastic

Color - copper with a medium body
Nose - fruit, candied apples, powdered sugar, toffee, maybe some citrus
Palate - some peat, rich and sweet, a hint of chocolate
Finish - first smoke, then a wave of caramel cones up, toffee, mulling spice, some cinnamon, long finish that continues to develop 

This one falls under “for celebration only”"
