5.0,"Copper red tinged. Looks viscous, really clinging to glass.

Smells of toasted coconut, burnt brown sugar, caramel, cinnamon, light clove, oak/wood. Smells incredible.

Toasted coconut persists on palate strongly along with burnt sugar. Slight licorice in finish.It's drying and oaky. Very drinkable without water, rich chewy mouthfeel. Cinnamon, pencil shavings, the brûlée form creme brûlée, a little butterscotch.

Water softens the above flavors and brings out a marzipan mid-palate and finish. That finish sticks around.

Damn good. One of my favorite bourbons and I didn't have to pneumonia or administer a disinformation campaign."

5.0,"Nose of fruit cake and almond. Taste is caramel and cherry with a toasted oak foundation. The corn notes are upfront but the finish is aged rye, with a bite of apple bitter. Very pleasant and ultra mellow."

4.0,"Had a great pour at Chimes in Covington  Louisiana last night. Not exactly the best atmosphere for a tasting (just to many wonderful aromas) but a great place to sample a great bourbon with great food. 

The nose just reaches out and grabs you. Loads of vanilla, oak and nuttiness. The pallet is just as memorable. It was half-price oyster night and the Smooth Ambler was a perfect match.

Just don't get no betta'!!!"

3.0,"Smell is a mild, dead at first, gradually opening up a bit to offer mere hints of rich, sweet caramel and vanilla, with cinnamon and wood-spice backbone. Cherry syrup as well, and some waves of alcohol heat. Taste is mellow at first, building to a surprising burn for a comparatively old spirit--and the finish is actually quite numbing. Leads with the lumber, the slightly sweet toasted wood. A bit of milk chocolate, vanilla, cherry syrup, wood sap gradually opening into slight maple syrup. Cinnamon and clove. Some bitterness. Adding water smooths out some of the rough edges, adds some citrus--orange peel, maybe--but also thins out some of the flavour. Leans a bit into over-oaked dryness on the (relatively short) finish, which is mostly bitter tannins. A fine whiskey, but nothing exceptional, and certainly not worth the premium price you're paying in some markets ($75+ in Alberta, Canada)."

4.0,"Old Line store pick. Great rich nose, fruit, spice, honey, vanilla. Stings the nose. All of that carries over to the palate, also with slight herbs and pecans. The sweetness is there, and the spice level is on point, lingers. Nice warmth going down. Great barrel. 3/4/19"

4.0,"Review transferred from Barreled (12/2016):

Another great sample from last night's impromptu bourbon tasting.  This review isn't just for the normal 10 year Old Scout bourbon, this is a single barrel, barrel strength that was bottled exclusively for the online whiskey retailer, Binny's.  The regular 10 year old comes in at an even 100 proof, while this single barrel is just over 117 proof.  

I did try a small pour of the regular 7 year old to establish a baseline and to see how well the extra 3 years goes towards improving this lower-to-bottom shelf bourbon.  I gotta say, the extra 3 years works wonders here.  The nose was still heavy corn, but that's where the similarities to the 7 year stopped.  The palate was very impressive:  there's vanilla, oak, toffee and even a bit of dark berry and cherries.  It was substantially sweeter and incredibly smoother, too.  The 7 year old was harsh and kind of uninviting.  

The finish was a bit short, but pleasant.  I'm not sure how difficult this bottle is to find, or even the price point, but damn it was unexpectedly a highlight of the evening.  I have to keep my eye out for more from these guys.  Good stuff and I recommend you guys to do the same.  If this stuff is around $30-40 a bottle I would consider it a steal.  Cheers."

3.0,"Nose: Very sweet, lots of vanilla, sugar, ice cream cone type cookie notes. Cinnamon and a little oaky clove, but very much a leaner into the sweet category. A lot of corn syrupy notes here which I think is the culprit.

Taste: Sugar and maple. Originally, I thought the proof was overpowering but that was definitely my virgin palate. Sweet and sugary, almost vegetal and corn heavy. It's complex but leans towards the sweet side with a lot less oak influence than expected for the age.

Finish: Medium but complex and relatively gentle. The proof is there but it's not punishing. Just a nice sweet departure (literally)

Overall: This is a fine dram, especially at the price. Although I'm not taking price into account, it's worth noting that this is a great value since it can be had for $45 or so where I'm from. It's no bargain like the Eagle, but it's still very reasonable. The flavors are strong and complex and there aren't any major flaws to speak of. For that, I'll give this a Rank 6.

Thanks for reading!

Rank: 6"
3.5,"Ah man I know it's Monday but you think I'll just have one, then another to finish up but that one isn't as good as the first one and before you know it you are chasing the original high. Like a milder form of meth I've heard.. the first one blows your mind but after that you never can reach the same high. I thought an American whiskey would get me closer after the Elijah Craig but I took one sip and thought ah damn it's like its milder brother. As per review number 2 I just read...' it's like Elijah Craig'.. I've had great American Whiskies that taste nothing like bourbon why make one that does. Anyhow as per my EC review..blargh..."
