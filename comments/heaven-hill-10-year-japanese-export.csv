4.0,"Oak and caramel on the nose with a slight dusty quality. Brine on the tongue, allspice, and caramel. Nice long finish."
4.0,"The nose is gentle with oak, brine, rye, cooked brown sugar and caramel. Oak and caramel carry over into the palate, followed by brine, vanilla, smoke, leather and rye. The finish is medium with lingering rye, oak and brine, while vanilla and caramel fade behind it."
