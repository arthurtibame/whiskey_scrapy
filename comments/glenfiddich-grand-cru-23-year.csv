4.25,"Interesting finish, kind of lifts up at the end, which I think is because of the bubblyness from the champagne? I don't know. Enjoyable dram, but I wouldn't pay the $300 the VA ABC is looking for. Very smooth with minimal burn. Palate was sweet with honey and maybe a white grape? I'd also venture to say there was a floral taste as well. Quite nice and I liked it better than the 18, but certainly beyond my price range.

The box is pretty cool. It spins open and makes a great presentation overall, which is the kind of vibe they're going for. That this spirit will enhance any mood, night, etc, and I think it'd be something nice to share with people who are fancy and would toast with champagne, but instead, the whiskey connoisseur gives them this and they'd all enjoy it and discuss how it's different."

4.25,"As smooth as a boat cutting through a still quiet lake. Fruity smell, with a hint of plum. Finishes with a sweet and refreshing after taste. Interestingly, after adding some water, the saltiness was enhanced.

P.s. Taste incredible when eaten with 85% dark chocolate."

4.25,"This is a review of the exclusive duty-free version bottled at 43%

Nose - Nice fruity/floral, dark fruity honey, vanilla, ripe apples, pears, hint of cooked golden raisins

Taste - Nice gentle candied ginger spice, golden floral honey, vanilla, hint of cinnamon, spiced apple/pear cider, lightly drying mouthfeel, fruity oak, golden raisins

Finish - Lingering gentle candied ginger heat, light grape seed/vine bitterness, fruity honey, more mix of ripe and unripe green pear, light mineral/chalky/dusty mouthfeel

Score - 86/100

Final Thoughts - I haven't tried the 40% version, but I expect the 43% version is significantly better as I think that slight bump in proof helps preserve and enhance some of the more subtle characters in this dram. This has a very nice pleasant nose that does hint to an effervescent/acidic grape influence to it which I found nice & enjoyable. This does translate a bit to the palate, but a bit more gently. I get a very dark fruity fresh honey vibe to the dram which is nice and I can see how this could appeal to the masses (especially those who are new to Scotch and are looking for something approachable). The mouthfeel does capture a bit of the mouthfeel and ""vibe"" I get from older Scotches. Finish is a bit short, but pleasant.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - No, I'd value this bottle at about $80-$100USD"

4.5,"The second break even bottle put out by one of my local establishments! The White Rabbit Speakeasy out in Gilbert AZ is killing it with these offerings! This a great example of a pricey Whisky ($299) that I would not typically buy or buy a retail pour on so this was a great opportunity. Taking a 23 yr old Scotch and finishing it in a Champagne cask doesn't sound like a great idea to me to be honest, so I was definitely skeptical. However, for $9.50/oz I was definitely willing to try it.... Let's dive in:

 For 40 ABV it's got a lovely mouthfeel and is very rich. Crisp Fuji apples and salted toffee leads. Mid palate introduces milk chocolate and cinnamon spiced pears. Just lovely. An array of wood spice, white grapes and a dash of clove on a lengthy finish. Sweet but not too sweet. This is one of those drams that you would have a hard time putting down! 

Now for $299 is it worthwhile? Honestly if that's within you personal budget I would say absolutely! 

Cheers all!"

4.0,"Excellent. This is the first I’ve heard of this offering and it’s easily my favorite Glenfiddich I’ve had. Has a non-overpowering sweetness to it while still keeping a complexity about it. Candied almonds and white grape stand out to me, with some salt towards the end. I love this and would never refuse a pour."

4.75,"Got a sample from a friend, this stuff is very good with notes of citrus, tropical fruit like mango and passionfruit, lychee, berries, apricot, and whites chocolate alongside toasted barley but this can benefit from a higher abv like in the 43-46 range"
2.75,"Soft nose with light hints of malt, lemon, grass and confectioner’s sugar. Starts gentle in the mouth and then swells mid-palate into lychees and other fruits. Long peppery finish with a hint of cream. I didn’t find anything special here - I’m not sure what the wine casks bring to the table - but it’s pleasant enough, especially when your local bar is selling pours at cost for members of its whisky club (cc @rmeister23)"
