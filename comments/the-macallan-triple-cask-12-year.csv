4.25,Extremely smooth with a fruity taste.
1.5,"Nose: Glassy (yes, glassy not grassy) cereal and sharp fruit notes. Grapefruit and beer. A vanilla hint and a raw ethanol aroma almost like grain whisky.

Palate: It starts as if it will be lightly sweet but quickly gains a hard, sour and rough edge. Flavours of malt, orange peel and old bitter walnuts. As it develops a hot gingery note comes forward to dominate the palate.

Finish: Medium. Fading out on tannin.

I found little to enjoy in this whisky. It is supposedly the old Fine Oak 12 year in new packaging, but I've had that malt and this is not as good.

It seems unbalanced, with little sherry influence. The main wood presence is an unappealing resinous character as of tired bourbon casks. There's also a raw spirit note reminiscent of blended scotch.

It does open and improve slightly after some time in the glass, gaining a little vanilla on the palate, and over time as the level in the bottle drops it improves slightly through oxidization. I never became particularly fond of this whisky, however, and I was glad to see the end of it once it was finished.

""Adequate"" : 1.5 stars"

3.25,"I have to be in a certain mood for this one .  It has a unique nose, a little more “funk” than most scotch I drink.  Has a medium finish with the same sherry theme for macallan.  I like the standard M12 better."

2.5,"This was my entry into the famed macallan distillery and I cant say I am impressed. Like another reviewer said, acrid and slightly off putting with some sort of funk in there. The double cask appears to be a very popular scotch, I'm not sure where they went wrong in the triple. 
Two friends also had the same reaction as me to this one and turned up their noses and made funny faces.
Can't win them all."

2.5,"A slightly off-putting acrid compost aroma, without any redeeming sweetness. When neat there is an alcohol burn even though only 43% proof. With a little water and time it gets smoother with some oak, vanilla and light toffee. Can’t taste much influence from the sherry or bourbon casks. The acrid notes return on the after taste."

3.75,"Exceedingly mild. Strong oak, middling citrus, and weak vanilla. Just like the box said. I prefer more consistent or more complex with my mild Scotches. The closest Scotch has ever come to a dreamsicle, if that’s your thing."

4.5,"Brown sugar on the nose.  Rich, sweet, vanilla on the palate with a long spicy finish."
2.25,"Fairly harsh on the palate. I hate to pile on but it is true what is being said about Macallan. Except for a few expensive bottles, they are really mediocre. It is drinkable and if you like the Macallan flavor profile you will enjoy but I have other bottles in the price range I would much rather drink. Talisker 10 absolutely destroys this and I can procure it for less $."

3.5,"Oh Macallan and this new expressions that feel that they are looking to fetch money to pay for the new distillery rather than giving people their money's worth in whisky. This is another 12yo from Macallan, a follow up to the ""double cask"", this triple cask has been matured in European sherry seasoned casks, American sherry seasoned casks and American ex-bourbon casks. 

Bottled at 40%abv

On the nose: Typical macallan aroma, but much more nutty. Vanilla cream, Vanilla oak, Very creamy. A little sherriness and Sawdust. Actually the nose is not bad at all.

On the palate, everything starts falling. Very oaky, Too woody. Smooth but say too woody for any flavors to develop properly. Not even toffee.

Aftertaste is short, with a mild oak spice and peppery note.

Overall this is a forgettable, normal, not remarkable dram, which you can just pass by. 71 over 100."
