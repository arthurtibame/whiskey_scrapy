2.75,"Samples of caramel and heavy on over ripe apples. 
A short and not impressive finish
Good to mix with a Coke"

2.0,This used to be a great staple for the low price point. Last two bottles i have gotten have been below accepted even for price.

4.0,Very smooth and quaffable.  Nothing special but great Kentucky whiskey at a nice price.
3.5,Great cheap wheated bourbon. Some people compare this to Weller Special reserve. Close but a not nearly as smooth as Weller. For 18.99 it’s good enough for me.

3.5,"Look: Jeffer’s Creek is a quite light whiskey, hay yellow, maybe some slight gold tones. Alcohol legs show up considering it’s only 40%

Nose: the nose is quite light, fresh fruit, apple, honey, swirling opens up more of the barrel and the slightest of spice. Judging from the nose, this will be a pretty tame bourbon, which makes some sense due to the low proof. 

Taste: the initial taste is similar to the nose sans the apple. Honey, vanilla, sugary bread. 

Finish:  really a quite light finish, a slight lingering taste, the fruit kicks in more once the bourbon hits the throat.  Not a lot of bitterness or heat.

Overall: I feel that if this were kept at a higher proof, this would be a really great bourbon.  The local shop owner who pointed this out to me mentioned this is distilled by Buffalo Trace. I tried Weller antique 107 & Jeffers side by side, and this didn’t stand up to Weller Antique. That said, there are some similar characteristics, but just more muted.  Jeffers Creek is a tasty, just not complex bourbon at a damn reasonable price."
