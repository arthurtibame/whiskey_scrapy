Nose: hints of honey and citrus 

Taste: (neat) engulfs the entire tongue and smoothes out. I feel a tinge of cinnamon.

4.0,"Light scent of almond extract and sweet cherry on the nose. Not overpowering and incredibly inviting. Spicy like a good rye should be. Black pepper, baking spice and a hint of vanilla on the palate. The finish lingers with a tannic oily coating of the tongue that seems to hint at this rye being younger in age. All together a great rye for sipping."

4.0,"Russell's Reserve Single Barrel Rye

Nose: Not betraying any higher alcohols, just orange cream soda, bright and carbonic, with crispy vanilla and a velvet citrusy overtone. 

Taste: chewy rye cereal and cream soda with navel orange, reminiscent of Cointreau, and then some of the more polite expressions of fennel and coriander come to play. 

Finish: soft and gentle tingle that so neatly and quietly ties the sweet cream, orange, and aromatics together with finesse. What really sets this apart--and adds to it's surprisingly delicate nature--is the distinct aftertaste of floral dandelion and violets!

So smooth for the proof, this is a dangerous treat and an interestingly fruity and floral expression of rye with much less heat and astringency than expected. 4.5/5"

4.0,"Nose - Sweet vanilla caramels, light sweet mint, faint milk chocolate powdered cocoa mix, hint of sweet artificial cherry.

Taste - Thin but drying, sweet oaky vanilla simple, hint of sweet mint, cherry candies, cinnamon heat, light oaky bitterness.

Finish - Sweet oaky simple lingers, cinnamon heat, long light slightly medicinal cherry sweet.

Score - 84/100

Final Thoughts - This was a tiny bit disappointing to me as it had a very pleasant nose, not overly complex but showed a lot of promise. Once it hit the tongue, it fell a bit flat from expectations in that it had more of a medicinal artificial cherry flavor than cherry candies and it had this slightly off putting wood/apple stem bitterness to it. Overall not too bad, but maybe single barrel variance made me have a slightly off barrel? It's good but not great and for the price, makes me want to reach for WT 101 Rye."

5.0,"Fantastic Rye. Steep price to pay but worth every penny. I am a huge fan of Pikesville and this one blows it away. smooth, with strong vanilla, butterscotch and toffee notes.  You do get a healthy spice swell on the mid pallette, and a long oak and tobacco finish. Proof is perfect at 104 to be a smooth neat sipper!"

3.5,"hot at first, opens just a little with a drop, with water, smoke nose, just slightly, still a hot tongue and overly peppery"
4.25,"Pour:  Chilled in glen cairn with one small cube.  Open for 15 minutes

Nose: (4.0)  Not overpowering alcohol for proof.  Sweet and bakery-like.  Vanilla and rye dominate.  

Palate (4.25):  Rye is upfront with bakery spice and cinnamon.  Mellows to an almost gingersnap flavor when the spice kicks in.

Finish (4.25):  Gingersnap turns a bit citrusy, alcohols comes in to warm the senses.  Smooth and lasting lemon poppyseed muffin type finish.

Overall (4.25/5)  This is a good rye.  Bit pricey for a single barrel rye of 6 years but worth it."

4.0,"I prefer it with a little water.  It has a peppery bite with pleasant rye flavor.  Vanilla, oak, tobacco.  This is on the milder side of ryes, but it's accessible and easy to drink at any time.  Because the rye flavor is a bit milder, there is a lot of subtlety that emerges behind it that would otherwise be overpowered.  There is a cracking-fresh cereal grain flavor and some mellow barrel  char in the finish, that might be easily overpowered by the rye.  I feel like it needs to breathe a bit before all the flavors really come out, but it's enjoyable when they do.  It's a really pleasant slow sipping whiskey.  I've had better ryes at the same price point(though most are hard to find), but none were this easy to kick back and relax with on a Sunday afternoon."

4.75,"I'm blown away by this offering from WT. The single barrel bourbon was my all time readily available favorite. This has a decent aroma, not very deep. On the palate it's flavors come in perfect waves of oak fading to sweet vanilla and leathery tobacco which then moves on to a very well balanced peppery spice. Finish is long and delicious. Maybe I got a great barrel but I'm looking forward to trying another bottle already."

4.5,"Pulled this out again as I decided to have a Rye blind tasting.  The 3 comps were Michter's Barrel Strength, Rosseville Union Barrel Proof, and EHT Straight Rye.  All sampled neat.  This one stood out as my favorite hands down tonight.  So rich, so full, so flavorful.  In company with the other three very highly appreciated ryes,  I am upping my 4.25 to 4.5 because of that.  It is just damned good rye."

3.75,"This is an absolutely superb rye whiskey! The strong flavors, the notes are all there and wonderful, as delicious as all the reviews out there say it is. Rye whiskey lovers are in for a treat. However, I cannot say I find its original price tag justified; to be $20 above their 6-year Rye. I might have been more agreeable if it were only $10 above. 
The only reason I bought it was because it was on a closeout sale for half the price. If money is no concern, then I'd definitely say give this one a go."

4.25,This is a definite Rye in character and also lends a firm handshake to it at 104 proof. It has a greater viscosity & complexity over the 6 year RR Rye. This still has the fresh herbal and mint nots but also amps up the peppery & Christmas baking spices. This is another fine all purpose Rye and the price is so competitive.

4.75,"Lighter golden color. Very slow moving and small legs. Nose is pleasantly soft for 104 proof; vanilla with floral accents. Nice initial palate of spice, pepper, and oak with complex undertones of sweet fruits. Extremely smooth finish given the higher ABV. Lingering tastes of warm honey. Overall an extremely good rye in my opinion where the rye spiciness and higher ABV don’t overpower the flavors."
