4.25,"Currently visit in the mountains of Ecuador in a very cool Place called ""baños"" i entered a bar and looked atthe whisky shelf and found a rarity: a limoted 15yo Old parr.

I bought a glass, neat, to make the most important kind of tourism there is: whisky tourism.

First of all it is a lot better the the normal old parr, i believe this blended scotch is not too famous in the US or Europe bur here in South America is like drinking water since it is so popular.

Bottled at 43%abv light gold color.

On the nose: stinky peat (like Johnnie walker red label) spicy notes, coffee and Salt, it is nothing special on the nose.

On the palate is rather good, starts with caramel (i can bet it is colored) spicy, peaty in a good pleasant way, medium bodied, smooth and oaky.

The finish is medium - long, very pleasant. With peat and spiced. Very well crafted.

After adding a couple drops of water all peatyness is gone to enhance spicyness and the toffee, caramel flavors and nosing notes. A rarity. If you can find it in any journey, buy it, you wont be dissapointed. 86/100"
