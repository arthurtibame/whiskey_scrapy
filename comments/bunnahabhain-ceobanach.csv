5.0,"VERY smokey, tarry, peaty, briney, seaweeds, creamy. No medicinal, rotten vegegal, rotten meat taste. Tastes like smokehead with MUVH more body and creaminess. Reminds me of a lapgroiag quarter cask without the medicinal taste. Also reminds me of a really aggressive caol ila 12 turned up way up. 

It's very good. Just as peaty and smokey as laphroaig and abdrdbeg but also very different. Has a very very clean peat and smoke taste, also I think it tastes the brineyest(mmmm)

Cheers"

4.0,"After having tried the most obvious Islay distilleries, it was time to try and sample Bunnahabbain. With a name that means 'Smoky Mist' I figured I couldn't go wrong, with this Ceòbanach. My first bunny was a satifying one. A lot of peat smoke, and definately some seaweed, but less rubbery than, say Ardbeg. There are also some hints of spices/peppers, and some citrussy fruits, without being overly sweet. Add to this a pleasant afteraste, that lingers a fair amount of time, and it's a recipy for a top dram. I must say that I'm still fond of the Laphroaigs and Ardbegs I've tried, but I'm growing more and more appreciation for the lesser known brands such as this Bunnahabbain."

4.0,"And this year's award for Hardest Name to Pronouce goes to this thing, however you say it ( I call it Bunna Habain Coo Bunch).   Don't let the name throw you, this is a really good Dram.  Thanks to Telex, as part of our little trading team, I got to sample this.  Lemon curd on the nose.  Unlike other Bunnas, there's no brine or salinity? Or very little, but certainly not like your typical Bunna.  On the palette, crisp and clean, lemon cheesecake with a slight campfire smoke.  Reminded me a lot of some of the better young Caol Ila.  Quite good.  Thanks Jason!"
4.0,"So, I’m finally finished plowing through our third round of distillery samples in the tour group.  This Bunnahabhain was provided by our newest member, Telex.  I didn’t have too many expectations here because this NAS is on the cheaper side, but boy-oh-boy was I mistaken.  This one was quite possibly one of the most refreshing whisky experiences I’ve had in awhile.  

The Ceobanach, don’t ask me how to pronounce it, is a pale yellow in the tasting glass and comes in at a slightly elevated 46.3% ABV.  My experience with Bunna is quite limited- I’ve only had the 12 year to this point, but that was a nice dram and this one is a winner as well.

The nose is a wonderful blast of seafaring notes:  seaweed, salt, brine with a nice citrusy overlay.  It smells like what I imagine an old sailing vessel would smell like.  The peat adds an extra dimension and some smoke comes and goes like the waves of the ocean.  While I wouldn’t dare say it’s inviting, it’s just a sensory thing to me.  Very interesting and, I gotta say, cool.

The palate falls in line with the nose.  Salt, seaweed and peat smoke that winds its way towards pepper and oak barrel notes.  It’s drying towards the end, but that feels appropriate and welcome IMO.

The finish is medium length, smoky and sun-dried peat wrestle again with the lemony citrus zing.  Salty and dry leaving your lips feeling like the first night you got sunburn on your face.

What can I say, this is more of an “experience” in a glass, than a thirst quenching dram.  It hits the spot if you know what to expect going in (and if that’s what you’re feeling at the time).  If you take your time with the nosing it will lead you down the path that this whisky wants you to take and for that I give it a bump in score.  Flavor profile, mouthfeel, etc- this is a 3-3.5 star juice, but if you follow the path it’s asking it’s a 4-4.25 star experience.  I really liked that.  Thanks again to Jason for sending this one my way.  Bon voyage, my friends."

3.25,"Yeah I think I'm with Telex on this one. It's nice but quite faint on the peat for me, I thought maybe a drop of water would open up to the flavours others were getting which it did for a brief moment but then a few drops more it fell apart. Its sorta like a much milder Ledaig with Ardbeg 10s lemony notes. Peats on the more acidic side, faint and lemony side which I'm not a huge fan of. It did grow on me towards the end but not enough to raise above the 3.25 level. I preferred the Timerous Beasty I had last night."

4.5,"info: Ceobanach veut dire, en Galeique, ""smoky mist"" ou ""brume fumé"" en référence à l'époque où la tourbe était une ressource essentielle à la vie courante notamment pour le chauffage. La tourbe provient naturellement de l'eau utilisé dans le processus qui doit être distingué du processus des autres produit de la distillerie. L'idée de conception de ce scotch est venue en rêve au Master distiller Ian MacMillan. Mention d'âge de 10 ans affiché sur l'arrière de l'étiquette. Non filtré à froid et sans ajout de colorant.

Esthétique: Pas wow mais rien à dire vu la gamme de prix. Belle couleur et bel emballage. Je ne pénaliserais pas ici. 10/10.

Nez: Sucre, céréale et fumé. Un sel maritime typique de Islay. Bunnahabhain ne nous a pas habitué à un tel éventail aromatique. Quelque chose de frais comme de la coriandre. Pas agressif du tout sur l'alcool. Agréable au nez 18/20

Bouche: Sucre, algue, verdure, sel marin, fumé bien présente mais quand même bien équilibré sur l'ensemble. Un poivre et de la vanille. Beau manège d'arôme! 35/40

Final: Frais et fumé. Sucré-salé. poivre. L'aftertaste est très agréable! 26/30

Overall: On croirait presque un Laphroaig légèrement moins tourbé et médicinal. La tourbe ici est sucré-salé et peu agressive. Le 46,3% est parfait pour exprimer ses arômes. J'apprécie en général. La complexité de ce scotch est très bien développé. surtout pour le prix. Bon rapport qualité-prix. Est-ce que ça plaira à ceux qui n'aime pas la tourbe? Non, je ne crois pas que c'est celui va changer l'opinion des gens sur la tourbe. Est-ce que les fan de tourbe forte vont aimé? La tourbe me semble assez présente pour satisfaire mes craving de tourbe. Peut-être que certains vont être deçu de l'intensité de la tourbe, y voyant un manque de caractère. Pour m'a part, j'apprécie l'équilibre général. 89% cette édition limité va me manquer une fois terminé!"

A smoky and earthy aroma with flavors that include some pepper, an earthiness, malt, vanilla, and light citrus. There is a nice sweet, honeyed, finish and, not my comment, but ""warm salted butter"" fits this well. The only drawback for me is a lingering bit of seaweed on the palate."

3.0,"Hmm, the nose is very light, but pleasant. Faint peat and smoke met with some floral heather and orange. Sweet hints of cake batter.  Palate - neat since it's 46.3...wow, more smoke on it than the nose. Very creamy, almost dreamsicle like. Medium mouth coat of oil on the finish. It has an extremely faint ashtray finish, but it's dry and not enough. Something is missing though, so adding a droplet of water.  Brought out more citrus orange on the nose.  Great taste still, but the finish, I am just not getting as much as I want."

4.0,"Super light straw color. Syrupy legs. Balanced peat nose, moving on to apples and chocolate. I'm instantly hit by a strong but well-balanced peat on the tongue, then wood. Briny, salty, bitter finish. Definitely benefits from a splash of water. Brings out some sweetness and smokiness."
5.0,"The perfect Islay dram. Tastes of sea, peat, and dark wood. Brings back all of the best memories of our trip."
4.0,"Stop number 47 on the SDT is Bunnahabhain. This Islay distillery is best known for producing unpeated single malts, but Ceobanach is their first peated malt since the 60’s. Officially it’s a NAS expression, but the back label states that it is at least 10 years old. Bottled at 46.3% ABV, non chill filtered and natural color of pale straw. 

The nose is all Islay. Smoky peat and big citrus notes. Lemons and oranges. Vanilla buttercream and plums with a hint of white grapes. Salty seashore/seashells and seaweed. Soot and ashes, oak, pepper and a little sawdust. A bit nutty like peanuts or roasted almonds. Floral with some light chocolate notes. 

The palate, like the nose, is all Islay. Peat smoke, big pepper, worn oak and ashes. Some salt, sweet oranges/orange juice and lemons. Vanilla cream. Not super complex but powerful. 

 Medium-full bodied mouthfeel that starts creamy but turns dry. 
A medium long finish with smoky peat, ashes and citrus. 

A good Islay malt with typical Islay goodness. It’s downside is that it is very similar to both Ardbeg 10 and Kilchoman Machir Bay. It rests somewhere in the middle as far as peat level goes but the profile is right there. Unfortunately the price point of $85 puts it in the not quite worth it category. Now, give this guy 12 months in an Oloroso sherry butt and you might have something special. Thanks to @Telex for the sample. 3.75
Cheers"
4.0,"It's that time of year where the leaves turned, the air is crisp and a smokey dram fits the mood.  I was anxious to sample this and thanks to @Telex, through our tasting group, I was provided that opportunity.  Bunnahabhain is often overlooked when seeking out an Islay, but they do create some well-crafted spirits, in my opinion.

A light, sweet peat and smoke waste no time greeting you on the nose.  The sweet smoke is infused with a winter maritime brininess.  As the smokiness starts to soften, fruit notes of apples, pears and toasted coconut with honey create a inviting sweetness.

A black pepper spicy arrival is wrapped in a medium-weight body.  Honey, honeydew melon with a touch of vanilla are exposed to the palate.  The smoke is constant throughout, but it does not overwhelm and supports the fruity, sweet side.

The finish starts off with a bit of tingle on the tongue.  Cigar ash and soot and woodiness with a skosh of honeyed sweetness remain on the palate.  As the list bit of flavor fades, some lemon zest comes through.  A nice, long lasting finish.

The whisky, for me, conjures an image of a New England seaside winter with chimney smoke in the crisp air (whisky has a way to create images and transport me to that place...sorry for the sappiness).  This feels slightly young (8 year-ish sensation) given the spicy kick.  This compares to that of Machir Bay, for reference purposes.  One that is worthy to pull out on that crisp evening and slow down time.  [Dry Glass: Damp chimney][88/100][Tasted: 11/4/17]"
4.0,"Thanks to Telex for this sample!  Well, this may be the winner for hardest to pronounce name in the scotch world.  A cursory Google search yields the meaning of the name:  ""smoky mist,"" a fitting appellation for one of this distillery's few peated expressions (an unusual distinction among Islay's whisky makers).  Based on this sample, Bunnahabhain's choice to go unpeated for their main line really is a choice, not a lack of ability.  Wow, this scotch is a dead ringer for Ardbeg 10 on the nose:  smoke, clay, and lemon cakes.  There's something in here that's similar to Caol Ila 12 as well, although with the sweetness dialed down.  On the palate, a strong bite of smoke, followed by that salty, briny, spicy combination that calls to mind grilled shrimp drizzled with lemon.  The finish is comparatively mild, medium in length, and again features a pleasant mixture of smoke, herbal peat, chives or some other grassy note, and citrus.  It's Ardbeg 10 by any other name.  Or is it Ardbeg's own doppelganger, Kilchoman Machir Bay?  Close call, close enough not to matter much.  It's more expensive, at $70-80, so I don't see a clear reason to prefer it over its brothers from another mother (twin-bill from another still?)."

Darby’s Gastown in Vancouver. Served in a Glencairn glass. $17. Looks about the color of chardonnay, so I'd say there's no added color. Big delicious briny peat smoke on the nose. Wow! Honey notes in the background. A very pungent and complex nose. Enough so that it's worth spending a few minutes just on the nose. Price is similar to Lagavulin 16. Yes, there's some bite on the tongue that ascribe to the 46% alcohol. Without being able to try them side by each, I'd say this the equal of Lagavulin 16."

4.5,"Smokey, peaty, coastal, salty, but not medicinal like Laphroaig, not earthy and vegetal as Ardbeg.  Strong black pepper.  It's more of a smokey , but otherwise light whiskey - smokey and light seems like a contradiction, but that is the most apt description, I think because it is more smokey than peaty, and the lack of overwhelming peat let's the core flavors shine through.  It's sweet, salty, some mild, dry, herbal flavors(something like oregano?)- it's like smokey sea water, mixed with just a drop of honey or butterscotch.  It has a nice balance.  The Distiller reviewer mentioned that it's like Islay, but with the sun, and a sunny day on Islay is just about a perfect description.  Laphroaig and Ardbeg are more like a raging storm on Islay, but this is a sunny day on Islay.

I really like this.  Might have to buy another bottle once I finish this one."

The extra 6% alcohol is a welcome addition here. A wonderful dram!"

4.25,"Rewarding. That is my summary of this not so complex whisky that i have enjoyed. It is not something that will change your life but i just truly had a good time tasting it. This is my third Bunnahabhain and frankly the other two did not impressed me much (Shania Twain quote). Ceòbanach actually means ""Smoky Mist"" and it is properly pronounced 'kyaw-bin-och'. This is the heavily peated expression from this distillery, famous for been ""not so peated"". 

Bottled at 46.3%abv, natural pale straw color, un-chill filthered.

On the nose, this is very interesting. Right away when you open the bottle, you will feel the peat and yellow apples. But those are fake aromas; when you pour yourself a dram, the notes change into this very creamy, peaty whisky. The most amazing and accurate aroma note is Rum Raisins ice cream. It is amazing how clean that aroma is here. Earthy peat is intense, sometimes too powerful as alcohol not as peaty. There is a marvelous tropical sweetness. Grapes and White wine. Beautifully perfumed.So far this is the best bunna' on the nose. So creamy. 

On the palate it is quite spicy. Definitively some raisin influence.Turns spicy fast.
Rum raisins ice cream.

Aftertaste has a lovely tobacco smoke.
Very rewarding. Nice Pepper, Puffs of smoke, very pleasant. Ginger and salt.

Overall this is a very good, straightforward dram. Not complex but somehow manages to be pleasant and ""fun"". I had to reason it a little while, because it was good enough to trick my scoring system into something higher, but a fair score for it is 88 over 100. For $70 a bottle, this one can be recommended."

3.5,"Nose: Bright but subtle peat with a maritime quality - like peat-reek carried on a sea breeze. It's not highly phenolic or medicinal (although there is a little kelpy iodine) but neither is it the woody bonfire smoke of highland peat - it's somewhere in between the two with a light tarry quality and some minerality. There is a mild citrus sweetness in the background but the overall impression is dry, poised and restrained. Over time as it rests in the glass the sweet notes expand to present a mild honey aroma.

Palate: A very sweet and lightly smoky arrival with a touch of saline and mild lemon. The smoky character amplifies as it develops and continues to build until it reaches a plateau and then begins to broaden. As it expands some mild vanilla and very soft white pepper is noticeable. It does not gain significant complexity, however, and over time the palate simply dissipates (but in a very pleasant manner). The texture is a little watery but far from anaemic.

Finish: Medium. Simply a continuation of the palate as the smoky qualities slowly fade from view. There are no intrusive plastic or metallic notes on the very crisp and lightly sweet/salt finish.

This is a simple but well-balanced whisky that it is very agreeable, with a fresh quality to both the nose and palate. It is extremely easy to drink and would be a great session whisky. It would also be an excellent first smoky whisky to pour for a novice as it shows many of the Islay facets but is highly approachable and ""friendly"".

Adding water is neither necessary nor recommended. There is no heat from the 46.3% abv and water merely seems to flatten the nose and dull the palate. It also unbalances the profile by introducing a starchy-cardboard note. Take this one neat.

You'd have to be awfully mean to dislike this merely because of its simple profile. It's a good whisky, but not a world-beater, and in my opinion a little over-priced. I tasted it from a 30ml sampler and although I enjoyed it I'm not enthusiastic enough to seek out a bottle. The official score here of 90 seems a tad generous.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"
