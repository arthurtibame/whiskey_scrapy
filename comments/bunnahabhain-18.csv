5.0,"Stunning, one of my all time favourites. Toffee and something akin to soap at the start, mellowing into a multi layered experience that I'm afraid I cannot decode. This is not a drop to be taken lightly, it demands time and savouring. When ever you fell the need to take a moment, be it quiet celebration at the end of a challenging day, or contemplation of what is yet to come, Bunnhabhain is the one to reach for. Classic, timeless, dependable."

4.0,"Sitting by a fire after a Father's Day BBQ with family and poured a dram to top the meal. Toffee, cinnamon, nutmeg and a touch of maritime breeze and a touch Vasoline start the adventure.  Rich fresh ground cinnamon, mixed nuts and Demura sugar swirl in and around the palate over a rich, deep amber body.  Over time, the malty sugars work their way into the palate and sweeten the dram as if you dumped a spoonful of sugar. A nice, rich, long finish of drying oak and spice remain leaving you chewing on the flavors. Finishes slightly bitter leaving a pleasant, oaky and dry palate.  Treat this slowly and respect and you are rewarded. Happy Father's Day. Sláinte. [92/100] [Tasted 10/15/14; 6/19/16]"

3.0,"Nose: nuts up front, hints of oak, caramel, grassy/marshy note, sherry.  Taste:  Nutty, oaky, sticky honey, closer to molasses, vanilla, salty marsh grass get stronger if you slurp or suck in air on the sip as if tasting coffee, hint of something like Werther's candy, but not quite that sweet, brief tart nip.  Finish is moderate and fairly dry, with a trace of bitterness in a good way, fading to slightly sherried sweet.  This would make a good introduction into Islay whiskies, especially for someone who was hesitant to try one of Islay's peat monsters."

5.0,"I don't think I've ever had a Bunna before, seems like a hidden little gem in Islay, operating in the shadows of it's popular brethren like Lag, Laph, Ardbeg, and even Caol Ila.  This was a true pleasure.  I had a dram during our monthly date night this past Saturday.   I noticed this lonely bottle sitting on the shelf, nestled between a Knob Creek and Jim Beam  ( strange product placement).   It's amazing how complex this is, considering I couldn't taste the traditional Islay layers of peat, but just salinity and hazelnut sweetness.   Almost like a salted caramel in a maritime setting.  I'm sure this has got to be cheaper than a similarly aged Ardbeg, Lagavulin, or Laphroaig...so, in my mind, a great VFM.  Need to seek out a full bottle."

5.0,"Nose - Ripe plums, decadent spiced fruit cake, hints of dark chocolate and coffee, bananas foster.
Taste - Heavily spiced fruitcake dominates, bit thin mouthfeel, dark toasted barley, chocolate/coffee granola, dark dried fruits, very fain wisp of campfire smoke.
Finish - Lingering spiced fruitcake again, lightly drying but still thin, nice white pepper heat lingers, light campfire smoke is still present, almost like a lightly smoked honeyed almond.
Score - 94/100
Final Thoughts - Like it's younger brother, this is an amazing Scotch. It's got an amazing nose that really screams ""enjoy by the wood burning fireplace during Christmas time."" Wonderfully sherried without being too overly sweet. A tiny hint of dry campfire smoke which I can tolerate unlike the wet iodine/rubber peat/smoke I get from other Islays. Wonderfully balanced, and reasonably priced for an 18 year old Scotch."

Mmm for the palate, I get a smooth and rich espresso coffee, hazelnut, briny goodness, mushroom gravy, and mint.  Such a pleasant complex glass with a solid medium finish. I adore peat, but this doesn’t need a high peat content to make its presence known.  Speaking of Presence, the theme of this dram should be “Achilles’ Last Stand” by Led Zeppelin.  I rate this a 4.5 only because the finish was a little dry for me. Outstanding stuff."

4.5,"Great whisky. Took a bit to get into it but once I tasted against Glendronach 21, Glen Balcalta and others I really rate this. An Islay style Springbank 18 I'd  equate it to - not the same flavour exactly but has that oiliness, dry finish and something I can't place my finger on. Came 1st on the night out of several whiskeys we tried. Have an unopened bottle at home so will be interested to see once opened how this one develops. Update. 3 years later I finally opened the bottle for a whiskey tasting with friends. That turned into a bit of a blur with 10 different whiskies tried but now with just 2 others to compare to it definitely needs a rating upgrade.  4.25 is my thinking. Rich lightly smoked cherry flavoured sherry, nice abv balance. At the current price I wouldn't get another bottle as there is better value propositions out there but don't regret buying the bottle. 
Update Jan 2020: This is one of the rare bottles which for me gets better and better with time open. It mellows whilst also rounding out further. 4.5"
4.5,"Westering home and a song in the air... What a craft presentation of an unpeated Islay Single Malt with a lovely natural color in the glass! The nose is elegant and amazingly complex with Mon Chéri confectionery, old leather and mild spices. Rich nut aromas, orange peel and raisins disguise distant hints of sea air. Intensely aromatic and yet well-balanced in the taste, you get distinct oakiness, stewed tea and dried fruits with honey, leading into a long, warming and peppery bitter finish. Bunnahabhain 18 is a high-class all-rounder, even without peat!

3.0,"Good nose - rich malt, sweet fruit (including banana), a hint of salt and smoke. After a little while there's a plastic note and some exotic spice. Sharp acidity on the tongue, yet smooth at the same time. Thick and viscous. Spice that lingers and coats the throat with warmth. The palate is muted, it's layered but subtle, with s noticeable but not unpleasant bitterness. The finish is prominent, however, maybe the strongest part of this pour. Sherry influence is light, in my opinion, and peat is barely noticeable. 7/27/18"

Overall: Nice! pour ceux qui aime le style de HP ou Old Pulteney, ce whisky est pour vous. Je comprends l'engouement  pour celui-ci autant  que  je comprends l'engouement pour le HP 18.

The palate is wildly complex and changes from sweet and spicy to salty and smooth while maintaining an incredibly round mouthfeel.  The 12 is damn close to the 18, the 12 has a brighter nose and spice to the palate- both are fantastic. This is tasty stuff and well worth picking up a bottle if you’re a macallan / mortlach / fiddich/ glenlivet/ aberlour/ pulteny fan. 👍🏼👍🏼"

Natural color 


Nose: chocolate covered raisins but good ones; deep dark fruits like plum and fig; very dense and concentrated 

Taste: full, rich and mouth watering; big, sweet fruits take center stage like apple, pear, mango, currants pineapple and orange; chocolate; slight pepper, chili and spearmint and a whisp of faint smoke and brine.

Finish: medium length; dark fruit slowly drying to a warm, rounded and drying spiciness along with chocolate and dark fruit and a hint of vanilla-frosted pastry.


Value: $125-150 in the U.S. and worth it.


Final thoughts: this is a deep, concentrated and complex dram which demands (and earns) your patience. The more time and focus you give it the more rewards are revealed. One of the better 18 year olds you can buy.

Bunnahabhain OB
18 years old
46.3% ABV
Bottled 2015
Price: 155 USD

First time I tried this, my wife and I were having some Nookta Sound oysters (sweet Pacific oysters) with a flight of 18 year olds from Bunnahabhain, Glendronach, and Macallan.  I felt the Bunna won, although the other two were delicious, and I was happy to overpay for a bottle in order to buy local.  

It turns out Bunnahabhain (12 and 18) pairs well with food, but isn’t as mindblowing when sipped alone.  This 18 is fairly complex, with both sherry and bourbon influences strongly present, but the ordering of arrival is wrong.  What I loved about the old Hightland Park line, before the Viking nonsense, is that the whiskies had a bourbon arrival, and then the sherry, before fading into a soft, flowery peat.  The story is harmonious.  Bunnahabhain 18 gives you a luscious Oloroso greeting with raisins and chocolate, before the bourbon notes of caramel and vanilla take over.  Not that the individual notes are bad, but the story is backwards, if you know what I mean.  The finish is spicy and woody, and really does spectacular with the right food pairing.  Try a dark and salty piece of chocolate… or sweet Pacific oysters.  At 120 USD, I would consider buying this again.

Palate: rich, oily, salty and sweet. Decadent salted caramel, baked apples, milk chocolate, nuts, lovely oak spice that coats your whole mouth, chocolate malt, salted mixed nuts chewy earthy peat. 

Finish: salt, leather, apples and cream, sweet dark fruit. The finish is this ever swirling tapestry of salt and sweet all of it framed in old leather and fruity cream.

Palate: oily and creamy mouthfeel, not nearly as sweet as the nose indicated, toasty nuts, spiciness, again the sherry influence is pleasantly apparent, the heat from alcohol shines through and a hint of smoke at the end

Finish: thick, long and malty, little bit of bitterness lingers and makes you wanna keep sipping

Palate- Sea salt initially, raisins, light smoke (again, barrel char), wood spice, chocolate covered cherries

Finish- Long, creamy finish with notes of candied raisins, spices, and dark chocolate 

Very nice. I’m a huge fan of the Bunna 12, and while it’s not a big step up, it really is delicious and a fantastic sipper. Nose is beautiful, with sweet sherry notes coupled with the traditional bunna saltiness. Palate matches the nose well, with a little added spice on top, and has a creamy mouthfeel with a long, tasty finish. Just sweet enough while not being over the top."

4.25,"Oh yes - I was really looking forward to this one. And it really didn’t disappoint my expectations. I have a bottle of the 12y which I enjoy a lot. Bunnahabhain definitely has a signature taste and in this 18y this shines even more with additional intensity and richness. 

The nose starts right of with a typical Bunnahabhain smell. You get dried fruits and the unique sherry portion which they include so well in their whiskies. There is some winter spice mix in there as well as a dark berry mix. And on the second smell after the first sip I also got a very surprising Indian curry notes (mainly turmeric and cumin) which gave me a huge smile because not do I simply love Indian spices but because it fitted so well in to the palette here. Very beautiful. 

On the palate you get a briny sweetness like syrup or molasses accompanied by the fruit and sherry aromas. The 18 years age also give this one a much welcome maturity delivered with a slightly leathery earthy background. But it starts off very smooth and remains smooth until the end of the very long finish. In no stage of the tasting you get the 46% ABV smell or burn. 

I will definitely try to get a bottle of this one when I can. It is kinda expensive but really worth the quality you get."

4.25,"I have read some amazing reviews for this whisky. People are absolutely nuts about it, they say it is amazingly balanced and full of chocolate. I had the bottle for some time, and it thought, ""ok, it is time to see what all the fuss is about"". I have now tasted it and it is a good whisky but nothing i would die for. 

On the nose, it is the best part, i got cocoa cream; Hay and Burnt grass, Cotton, Coffee and of coursw that Chocolate kote everyone is rambling about. 

I am not going to use my ""since this is an islay dram i wanted peat and since there is none, i am going to destroy this"" card, because i knew beforehand that this whisky had almost no peat on it.

On the palate it is a good dram. Orange notes, more Chocolate; Milk powder. It is very nutty. I liked it. 

Aftertaste was good also, without been great. It is mostly burnt hay and orange /chocolate notes.

Overall i think this is a very good dram, just not excelent. It almost made 4.5 stars, but to be honest i don't think it deserves it. 89 over 100 is my score for it."

5.0,"Nose: A welcoming, enfolding cloak of sherry and oak wraps around you as you deeply inhale the aromas of a faultless Christmas cake. Dark malt, dried fruit and sweet roasted nuts (hazelnut and toasted almond) with rich leather aromas. There's a sly note of lemon zest in the background as well as a reminiscence of smoke and waxed furniture, but it's not like a typical ""smoky"" whisky.  This is like sitting in front of a roaring fire on a cold night where 99% of the fumes are combusting and just a skerrick of smoke escapes to your nostrils. As it continues to unfold minty notes and caramel toffee emerge. [The dry-glass aroma is fruitcake with a hint of charcoal].

Palate: The taste of liquified oloroso sherry cask, chocolate toffee, sweet tobacco and fruitcake. Deep, resounding and malty with a texture that is creamy, chewy and perfectly balanced between sweetness and astringincy. It arrives dry and spicy but sweet fruity notes, vanilla and warming muscovado sugar instantly spring forth to provide equilibrium. There is the tiniest hint of salt and it coats the mouth with ecstasy.

Finish: Very long. The warming, dense sweet malt character subsides slowly into a sweet oak aftertaste.

This is a magnificently expressive whisky. It's some years since I last tasted it - why have I waited so long? The progression from the malty arrival through to the oaky aftertaste is a joy every time. The nose is similar to old Glenfarclas but the palate is less austere. This whisky fairly flings itself out of the glencairn into your face with joie de vivre.

Oh, and don't add any water at all - there is nothing to be gained from diminishing this stunning malt.

There's very little more to say. It really is a desert island dram and you need to taste this whisky at least once on your journey (and you may well decide not to continue, but just settle down with Bunny 18). It's one of those excellent drams that always leaves you thinking ""why do I bother drinking anything else?"". Some whiskies you rate with your head - others you embrace with your heart and soul. For me this is emphatically one of the latter.

Many thanks to @Soba45 for sending me the tasting sample, and reminding me of what I'd forgotten. I've just this moment tried to order a bottle but alas, there is none in the country. Please Bunnahabhain, send us another allocation.

""Outstanding"" : 5 stars"

4.0,"It's very rich with plenty of peat and smoke. It tastes savory, kind of like Lagavulin 16 with its sweetness, but it also has a more herbal, medicinal flavor like Laphroaig 10. Its quality seems somewhere between the two. I enjoy it and would be happy to drink some more with its mix of interesting flavors, including some spice and cherry, but it isn't an all-time great. It's a little better than Ardbeg Grooves Committee Release."
5.0,Nothing short of perfect. I'm in Bunna-heaven.
