4.0,I like chick whiskey and this is a lovely one. I think I like this one better than the Glenmorangie Lasanta or the Quinta Ruban. Best used as an after dinner whiskey :)
4.0,"Well, no one else took the hint (instruction really) about reviewing the newer NAS Nectar D’Or under this heading, so I’m going to make a start. 

And my considered opinion is: yum. It’s pale gold, like the dessert wine that lent its barrels for the finish, with a definite fruity sweetness on the nose and the palate. The apricot jamminess falls just on the right side of cloying, with a pleasant vanilla and almond-nutty finish. 

I don’t have the previous release with an age on the bottle, but I will say there’s nothing harsh or young about this (though equally there’s nothing super complex either). This is an excellent whiskey for folks that don’t like whiskey, and a good one for those that do."

5.0,"Brilliant stuff with notes of honey, citrus, orange, white chocolate, apricot, vanilla, floral and buttery notes. I know someone who says the liquid is the same as the 12 year and the age statement was only removed from the label."

3.0,"Probably my least favorite of the 4-pak, being sweeter and with a strong white wine bouquet. Doesn’t mean I don’t like this—I do, it’s delicious. I just prefer the other drier barrel finishes. Still a buttery sweet scotch that’s very easy to enjoy."

4.0,"Nose is floral honey, vanilla, and cream.

Taste is lightly sweet, briney, floral, and tart with a long astringent finish.

Bought as part of a four bottle (10 cl each) box for $30."

4.0,"You can absolutely taste the standard 10y/o in this NAS whisky, but it’s sweeter, oilier and with a good smack of vanilla.  Creamy with ginger, pepper nutmeg and oranges, with a lovely dessert wine kick.

I’ve always liked a Glenmorangie, but this is quite delicious."

팔레트: 매우 상큼, 화이트와인느낌 침과 섞이면서 달콤해짐과 약간의 스파이스

3.25,Sweet. But with honey and vanilla. Not so much dried fruit. Mild spice. Not as mature as what I typically enjoy but quite nice. Had a dram after a piece of pumpkin pie and that paired very nicely.

4.25,"This is the final stop on my tour of the Glenmorangie core expressions, and it was worth the trip.  The nose brings to mind marmalade and biscuits.  The taste is crisp and smoke free, with hints of orange peel and honey.  Perhaps not as complex as the Quinta Ruban, but an excellent easy drinking whisky.  I’d buy this again."

4.75,I always love this one. Very sweet from the dessert wine finishing.
3.25,"""A pleasant honey/vanilla spice dram that is easy to sip and share!

Nose: green fruit and vanilla
Palate: spice first then vanilla. Honey becomes more apparent as you sip.
Finish: lightly spiced and honey. A very nice finish"""

4.0,Sweet honey and flowery at the front and ends with fruity finish
3.75,Truly like Glenmorangie.  Their line up is so diverse that makes them a great choice for scotch drinkers.  This one is sweet and fruity and the finish is a little long but not harsh.
