4.0,"Nose - (w/o water) Rich dark vanilla caramels, roasted nuts, dark roast coffee beans, oiled leather (w/ water) Vanilla caramels, dark toffee, roasted nuts w/ skins

Taste - (w/o water) Rich dark, oaky vanilla caramels, hint of peanut skin bitter, cinnamon spice, roasted nuts (w/ water) Oaky vanilla caramels, light bitter nut skins are more prominent, dark brown simple

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering oaky brown simple, oiled leather, hint of burnt nut skin bitterness (w/ water) Lingering sweet toasted nuts, faint tingle, oaky brown simple

Score - 84/100

Final Thoughts - So this started out with a fantastic nose, but once it hit the palate, it tasted a bit overoaked and a tiny bit tannic. It starts out pretty good, but then this sudden nut skin bitterness soon takes over and gets a bit distracting. The delicious dark vanilla caramels get drowned out. This one is better without the addition of water as I think the water enhances the bitterness and surprisingly for the higher proof, it doesn't drink as such.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - Not another"
