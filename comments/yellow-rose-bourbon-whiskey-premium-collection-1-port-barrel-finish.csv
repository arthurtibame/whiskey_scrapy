4.25,It’s very sweet up front. It somewhat reminds me of a sweet oatmeal raisin cookie with a Smokey finish. If you like a sweet bourbon this is a good get.
3.5,"Nice amber color. The nose is caramel, toffee and banana. 
Taste is young with vanilla and cinnamon. Spice and mint. Long finish. A touch of sweet, chocolate and fruit from the port finish."
