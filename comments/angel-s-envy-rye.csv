4.5,"I would say the Distiller rating is off and have to disagree based on my bottle. I'm in total agreement with the Mass tasting score.  I'm saying a conservative 93! Delicious!
Best Rye I have ever experienced! Very unique like no other! My ? is  to other reviewers. I realize this was matured in Rum Casks but  do you think they add sugar as it is super sweet on the palate???"

3.25,"No surprise that there’s rum on the nose. Coconut maybe? The sweetness hides the fact that it’s quite astringent. On the body, I can get the pickle juice flavors I’d expect in a rye, but they’re overpowered (in a good way) by sweet maple and coconut. Finish is a soft rye buzz, with the sweet flavors losing ground to the standard rye brininess.

The rum in this is so influential that it deviates from rye much more than its port-finished brother deviates from bourbon. I now understand the argument I’ve heard that this shouldn’t still be called a rye. I disagree, but I get it. I think most rye fans would find this as a one-and-done entry in their shelf, but rye haters might find this more approachable. For me, I doubt I could have more than one drink of this on a given night."

4.75,"The Angel's Envy Rye hasn't been available in my market for years. I had the pleasure of tasting it once in Kentucky and just had to buy a bottle. I found one and have been hoarding it for nearly a year. Yesterday we celebrated my 10th wedding anniversary, making it a perfect occasion to open it up. Great whiskey tastes better with great company.

This is such a unique blend. I can easily pick out the spice and heat of the rye, but it is pleasantly mellowed by the rum barrels. I get sweet honey and fresh bread on the nose. The honey is present with the rum on the taste, but neither is overpowering. Undernieth is a robust and spicey rye. The finish lingers with a slightly herbal and sweet aftertaste. 

This is certainly a dessert or special occasion whiskey. It's too sweet (and WAY too pricey) to be a daily drinker. I will be on the look out for another. It may be a while before this one is gone, but I love it and wouldn't mind having a reserve bottle on hand (it may make me less stingy when enjoying this bottle).  

Cheers!"

Amazing nose/pallet but room to improve with complexity/balance.

Had to drop the score on this one. After becoming curious about the labeling choice of this whiskey, I.E. ""rye whisky"" and not ""straight rye whiskey"" I learned that it is in fact flavored whiskey. Not sure exactly what they're adding to it, and honestly I like the flavors. But I can't give it a high score when compared to other straight whiskey's whose flavors were developed through traditional methods and not by adding flavoring compounds."

4.5,"This is the third batch I've had and, I must say, it never disappoints. Nose screams maple syrup, as if vaporized with all its sweetness by the heat of your morning pancakes. Coming along are demerara sugar, molasses, cinnamon, cardamon, plantains, guava, and faint vanilla beans. Palate is syrupy sweet--this is unashamedly a digestif. More of the same maple and cinnamon notes, caramel, cake batter, and baking spices. The finish pivots markedly, showcasing its MGP sourcing with clove and fennel. The dill is there, too, if you look for it, but either barrel selection was driven by a need to avoid this note or the rum casks particularly steamrolled it during the secondary barreling as it is no where near the potency of other MGP-sourced ryes. There are more tropical fruit notes, decadent rum raisins, and a velvety, fully coating mouthfeel.

It's always been a bit polarizing due to the sweetness, but I keep finding it to be one of the best ryes available each time I return to it."

Nose - Caribbean rum...  Then some creme brulee.  That's about it.  

Taste - vanilla icing, sugar, cinnamon rolls, cake...just a lot of dessert.  The thing is...where's the whisky?  i can't find rye spice.  I can't find the oak barrels.  Are we sure these barrels weren't still full of rum?  

So I'm left with, this is tasty stuff.  It's sweet the point I don't want more of it after a few tastes.  But it's not good whisky either.  Worse yet it's 100 dollars...why?  

i'm scoring it as a whisky and giving it a 1 star.  It's not terrible so it earns the 1 star but I'm just baffled why this is a whisky in the first place.  For me this bottle is likely going to just evaporate from the bottle before I get back to it, but I might share with those who don't like whisky.  My sisters seemed to like it at christmas."

4.0,"Lincoln Henderson, whose signature is at the top of every Angel's Envy bottle, was the Master Distiller at Brown-Forman for almost 40 years and is credited with creating Woodford Reserve, Jack Daniel's Gentleman Jack, and Jack Daniel's Single Barrel brands.
He created Angel's Envy in 2006 and released the port barrel finished bourbon. Since then, the company has become a family run business. After Lincoln Henderson's passing, his son Wes has taken over the reins and in turn his sons, Kyle and Andrew,  have also joined the company. Bacardi officially owns Angel's Envy now but chooses to let it operate independently.
This bottle is labeled as batch ""9I"" and bottle 1483. There's very little information to be found that's current. Info from prior batches indicate that it is from MGP, 95% rye and 5% malted barley mashbill, aged 6 and 7 years. It's blended in batches of 8 to 12 barrels before being rebarreled in Caribbean rum casks and aged for up to 18 more months. Supposedly only 48,000 bottles are released annually and given how hard it was to find a bottle in Arizona, I would certainly believe that.
Lots of sugar and cotton candy on the nose, along with vanilla, sugar cookies and a hint of grassy note. On the palate it's super sweet with maple syrup, brown sugar, molasses, and spun sugar. There's recognizable rye flavor of dill and cut grass towards the end but it's very faint. Finish is extremely long and sweet with the same flavors that are found on the nose and palate.
Having had the chance to taste a few excellent aged rums, this whiskey actually reminds me more of those rums than rye whiskey. Perhaps that is due to the extended finishing time in those barrels (most finished whiskey spends only 6 weeks to maybe 6 months in the finishing barrels), but I for one am not complaining!"

5.0,My personal favorite. But I have a major sweet tooth. Not as strong of a grain rye flavor as some ryes but it’s Carmel candy apple in bourbon form.

2.5,"Aroma has a heavy baking spice – nutmeg dominant – quality to it, that sits nicely with the dessert and fruity sweet notes; Palate though is so so sweet, just one heavy sweet note after another that pummels through building and escalating to just shy of the tipping point; Finish borders on cloying, but pulls up just short with some dash of oak to keep it in line."

3.5,"It’s not Cinnamon Toast Crunch. It’s FRENCH TOAST CRUNCH lol. The first time you taste this, thats all your going to taste. But it changes into more rye the more you drink and balances out. It’s so unique it’s worth the buy just to say you had it. This is first try tho. I feel angels envy is very nuanced and always gets better the more you try it"

4.5,"My favorite rye to date. Love the run cask finish. Super sweet nose, reminds me of some sort of candy I can’t place. Sweet on the tongue, spicy and. Drys out a bit in the finish with rich rum notes.  UPDATE: Peanut brittle! I think it’s peanut brittle!"

5.0,"Caramel, vanilla,"
4.0,"Wow! This is unlike anything I've had to date, the rum cask really comes through almost to the point you would think you were drinking rum.  Sometimes I get caramel on the nose that translates to the palate, other times gingerbread and mint, with a little heat and spice from the rye...this is a gateway whiskey for those who claim they don't like the stuff..."

3.75,"Color: soft and golden brown

Legs are slow forming but quick running, similar to the nose where it picks up steam.

Nose: so sweet: butter, toffee, sugar cane, like a buttery syrup about to put on my pancakes.

Body is thick and sweet, some of that rye breaks through to provide some spice and more pungent notes. 

The finish is rich; half sweet, half spice but all nice. The most unique part of this one is the change from the nose to the finish, that's the real surprise.  

Overall a once in awhile sipper, a little too sweet for me but still a high quality bourbon."

4.5,Nose gives a hint of sweetness which is not evident until you get into the rum cask finish. Light mouthfeel with excellent spiciness on the tongue. Finish is great as it stays for a good time. The rum cask finish is evident and imparts a deliciousness to this rye. Excellent dram.
3.5,"Incredible nose; vanilla & maple syrup with a definite rum influence. So good!  Palate is a bit light, however a wave of cinnamon spice envelops the back of the tongue. Quite smooth.  Short, pleasant finish.  This is a very nice and unique whiskey.  Although not an everyday sipper, I could definitely see this becoming one of my go to bottles for special occasions."

4.25,"I forgot to add this taste. I stayed at a friend's house for a weekend in February and his guests gravitated to his fancy bar setup towards the end of the night. He's not a whiskey enthusiast by any means, but he possessed some good recognizable options I've had before. The one whiskey I had not tried was Angel's Envy Rye. I currently possess the slightly underwhelming bourbon port finish so I was eager to compare. 

Just for clarity I was already a few light beers deep and I drank 2 rye pours in a standard rocks glass neat. Despite those drawbacks the AE Rye was clearly superior to the bourbon. The AE Rye was a heavily spiced Christmas dessert in a glass. Even though it was 100 proof, it was smooth sipping all night. Highly enjoyable, and honestly tastes nothing like any rye whiskey I've had. I attribute that to the very long 18 month rum cask finish because I'm not a fan of the standard MGP rye profile. If this wasn't $100 and scarce I'd consider buying it!"

4.75,"If I could capture the smell of this, soak it in cotton balls, then tape them to the inside of my nostrils, I’d have done it by now. The fragrance is by far the best of any spirit, especially when you dig your nose into the snifter for the first glorious aromatic traipse. The taste is supreme, woody but buttery like you were licking grandma’s cookie-cutting-board, then finishes with the spice of a rye, but subdued by the rum cask aging. The only issue I, personally, have is that I want to forgo drinking it in lieu of smelling."

4.75,"Deep flavor, spicy, vanilla, smooth!"
3.75,"Licorice and maple leap out, though the nose is more maple than the palate is. It's very sweet and quite fun. It's sort of like Kentucky Owl 11 mixed with some rum and maple syrup. There's some rich woody backing that is well balanced with the maple. It's fun but not what I expect from a rye the smoke is plentiful and it's bitterness helps to offset the intense sweetness. Maybe it's like Kentucky Owl mixed with Ron Diplomatico. If you handed me this, I'm doubtful that I would guess it was a rye. There's some harsh spiciness that is cinnamon flavored with a bit of mild Christmas spice. The complexity and balance are both very good. The alcohol is there but is fairly subdued. There is some mineral flavor that I'm not a fan of so I guess I just wish this wasn't a rye. It all blends very well. It smells buttery and custardy. To the extent that there is fruit, it is dark cherry. I'm confused by this because it is very good, but it is hard to judge as a rye. I would happily sip it though."

4.75,"One of my personal favorites. Much on the same level as a Balvenie 14 year Caribbean Cask, a smooth finish with notes of vanilla and rum make it a drink worth savoring. I always drink it neat with 2-3 drops of water to open it up further."
