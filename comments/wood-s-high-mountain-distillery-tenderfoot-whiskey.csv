4.0,"Nose: grains jump out first, definitely showcasing the malts, followed by fresh peanuts and a hint of chocolate. 

Palate hits with a smooth sweetness, vanillins, light oak, notes of chocolate. Adding a touch of water opens this up to the grain variety

finish starts off with notes of chili peppers, a bit of alcohol burn that fades into light baking spices. Long lingering finish"

And given the good reviews it has received I believe I've gotten a skunk bottle but I don't think what I have should be advertised as consumable."
