4.25,"Stunning rye value for the price. Complex combination of herbal flavors (dill, mint), baking spices (cinnamon, clove), and bourbon sweetness (caramel, vanilla). High proof but sippable, takes a splash of water or cube of ice well. Will buy again and again."
4.25,"Awesome rye from Knob Creek. At 115 proof, it’s surprisingly easy on the nose and smooth as can be."

4.25,Spicy up front and very complex at the end.  Would be better enjoyed with someone special.
4.5,"So for the past several months my buddy @dubz480 has been telling me about this store pick and how much I needed to try it.  Since my collection had grown out of control over the past few years I wasn't buying many new bottles, and Knob Creek just has never been that appealing to me in the past. But I had cleared some space on the shelves and was ready to reload so in my last order I decided to give this one a shot, and all I can say is wow, so glad I did!

Beautiful dark brown color that looks thick like motor oil in the bottle.  The initial taste sets you back with the thick oily mouthcoating and sweet orange peel and caramel flavor hitting you almost immediately.  That gives way to pepper and rye spice with some of the oakiness coming through as well.  
The finish is long with a pleasant amount of heat.  More of the pepper and some dark fruit flavors come through at the very end.  All of which are well balanced throughout and it leaves you with that satisfying warm sensation. 
All in all this is a fantastic rye, and at $36.99 you would be hard pressed to find a better value anywhere.  Hats off to @Dubz480 for another great recommendation!

Cheers!"

4.5,"The nose is complex with notes of cinnamon and cloves in the spice profile.  There is a sweet hint of maple and vanilla followed by just the lightest notes of a salty brine.

The whiskey has a spicy bite that allows the brine to surface.  There is a sweet undercurrent of vanilla and burnt spice throughout the drink that transitions to brine and wood smoke in the finish.  The whiskey settles in the chest with the distinct glow of a long, slow burn.  Its scent rises in the throat as notes of cinnamon and maple that makes for a very pleasant experience.  Extremely late in the finish, after even the glow has dissipated, it leaves the mouth with a distinct peppery flavor."
4.5,"Wonderful nose: maple sweetness. Very nice balance of that sweetness and pepper. Finish slowly fades out, leaving a little spicy reminder that is excellent."
4.0,"Got this as a store pick (obviously), aged around 5.5 years. Got to taste it first and thought it easily warranted the $42 price point to pull the trigger. A damp hay spice in the front melts away into a sweeter, smoother finish with floral notes drifting in and out. To me, the Knob Creek brand is reliably good (and available) and one of the best values out there in the Bourbon game. Keep it up Beam...keep it up"
