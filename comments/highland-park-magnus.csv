3.0,"Sitting in my favorite Hartford Irish bar enjoying fish and chips and enjoying game two of the World Series.  Peeked onto the whisky self and immediately recognized the strangely shaped black bottle.  Being a big fan of the ""old school"" Highland Park, this was the opportunity to sample the ""new school"" product coming out of the Orkney Islands.

The nose has the Highland Park light rubberish smoke.  Working the nose, a low-tide maritime brine blends into the smoke producing a slight funky nose (funk in the George Clinton style).  Give it some time and the fruit and sweet come through. Caramel apples and toffee arrive along with toasted almonds.

The palate is thin and soft.  A mix of sweetness and spice blend with vanilla, brown sugar, ginger and cinnamon.  A touch green apples come through along a mineral quality.

The finish is medium-short in length with wood, lemon citrus with a tinge of ginger.

As I was tasting and thinking about this whisky, the constant thought in my mind is that this just seems like a watered down Highland Park 12.  As others have mentioned, that I read, this is akin to Johnnie Walker Black.  I admit I was somewhat disappointed and had higher expectations.  Maybe to keep the HP followers in line with their current marketing strategy with the reduction of their age-statement whiskies, and to apease them with an affordable product, they produced Magnus since their other NAS whiskies are, in my opinion, overpriced.  It's not a bad whisky.  It's just lacking a boldness. I think one would be better served shelling out $10 to $15 more for HP12 (at least while it still exists). [84/100][Tasted @ Vaughans: 10/25/17]"

3.0,"Highland Park Magnus:

Nose: smoked red vines licorice, dried fruit.  Eventually fresh roasted candied nuts like the kind at a baseball game. 

Taste: touch of dried cherries, wood, vanilla, more wood, salt, herbal, eventually maple.  reminds me a little of a rougher Talisker sometimes.  A few drops of water helps smooth it out.  Some smoke and peat on the finish. 

Less sweet than the 12 year, lets the smoke stand out a little more.  I dig it, great for the price."

3.0,"The amusing thing was that I went into the liquor store today just looking for something cheap for a daily dram, like a Johnnie Walker Black. Well, they actually had this new one, and I thought, ""What the hell, might as well"" since it was 40 bucks. Heather, with light fruit on the nose. Pineapple, caramel, slight peat and smoke. Decent, but nothing special. I wouldn't dare touch it with water at 40%. Similar palate - nice splash of sweetness, but not in a cloying manner. Toffee, smoke, and some oak notes. The strangest thing to me is that this is not at all much different than the Valkyrie, which is twice the cost. The finish is similar to the Valkyrie as well, with a short subtle coffee bean after taste. On par with the standard JW Black, and a good option for a standard if you want something cheaper."

4.0,"Peat and brine lead the way but make room for some exciting tones. If you're willing to stick with it, you'll find a hint of apple and plum. Stay even longer and you'll reap the rewards of vanilla fudge.

The mouth feel is a tad lite. That's not a bad thing, but I do like a bit more chew in a scotch. One need not worry about heat. It hardly makes an appearance. Each sip is incredibly smooth with smoke laced elegantly throughout. That does make up for some of the vanishing on the palate. 

As the least expensive of any Highland Park, it's still very much Highland Park. It's easy to enjoy, very shareable and a great entry level scotch. The only real flaw with Magnus is that Highland Park 12 Year does everything slightly better for a few bucks more.

Still a treat nonetheless. (FWF share #37)"
4.0,"While not the most complex, this is a very good whisky. And, easy on the wallet. A definite must try."
3.0,"Welcome to the next generation of Highland Park NAS whisky....

We could go round-n-round on the merits of No Age Statement whisky.  I will concede that it’s a necessary evil due to the meteoric rise in popularity of whisky (and spirits in general).  Well, this is what we have to deal with now:  youthful, harsh stock mixed with lower and lower amounts of well-aged goodness.  Some distilleries are handling it well, some not so much.  Sadly, I think Highland Park is slipping towards the latter.

(Steps down from the soapbox)

This particular offering:  Magnus is a NAS whisky named in honor of HP’s owner, Magnus Eunson, who is a direct descendant of the Viking lineage that settled Orkney.  His namesake whisky is composed of juice from first-fill American sherry casks and ex-bourbon barrels.  It’s an industry minimum 40% ABV and currently is exclusive to North America.  It’s yellow gold and leaves hearty water droplets all around the glass when you swirl it.

The nose is predominantly sherry and oak with little to no smoke, even after 15-20 minutes of intermediate swirling.  The palate is pretty sweet with subtle hints of chocolate and smoke.  It gives away its lack of age rather quickly- it’s harsher than I expected and finishes with a lightening quickness.  I actually think I’d bump it if it would just hang back for a minute or two.  It’s just gone so quickly.  What happened?  Ahh, drats...

Overall, it’s disappointing in every aspect except one- price point.  This bottle can be had for $40-45.  That’s awesome.  The sad part is that they are using this youthful juice for this instead of letting it age gracefully.  It makes me sad this stuff could turn into 18yo sauce if given the chance.  But, as it is, I think a solid 3-3.25 stars is warranted.  Thanks for offering me a taste, @Telex  Glad I got a chance to run this one through it’s paces.  Cheers."

4.0,"I love to rag on Highland Park's no-age-statement expressions, as the distillery releases them in wave after wave, rapidly diluting the value of the brand name in favor of today's profits.  That being said, sometimes, one encounters a pleasant surprise in the NAS world.  Magnus is one of the newer members of this genre, and is positioned to be the true entry-level single malt in the Highland Park lineup, at an affordable, Glenlivet/Glenlivet 12-esque price of $35 or so.  I wasn't expecting much, but I got plenty.  This is not a sophisticated dram by any means, but it's kind of like the fun, trashy Netflix show that you end up clicking instead of the nuanced, prestige drama that you wish you could tell your friends you were watching.  The nose smells exactly like green apple Jolly Ranchers.  The palate, while understandably thin at this minimum ABV, also has plenty of that green apple, honey, and perhaps a wisp of that characteristic Highland Park roast coffee.  The finish is malty and honey-sweet.  What a fun, vibrant, youthful dram, and my favorite among the Highland Parks without an age statement.  Thanks to @Telex for the sample!"

  Honestly, quality for price, bang for your buck, taste per euro, this is the best whisky i've tried in this price range. 
  
  I was wary of the marketing and the bottle packaging, so i didn't buy this HP first time i saw it, despite my love for the brand. Boy, was I wrong! Light smokiness, some herbal smells, medium saltiness, honey and fruits. Classic highland park, but i must admit it felt a little subdued, depsite their ""Viking"" marketing etc. 
  
  The bad: it felt watery. But you have to expect some dilution due to its price range. 
  
  Conclusion: If you love peaty highland whisky, treat yourself. Probably the best price/quality ratio you'll find for a single malt."

*Notes* The taste is spot on with the nose - vanilla and honey with a lingering trace of what I would call “musty.” I feel like there’s hints of smoke, but it’s a bit bashful. 

This is a solid offering from the good folks at Highland Park. It’s consistent with the other expressions, with  a subtle lack of quality you would expect at the lower price point. It isn’t bad and is definitely a good value, although it’s difficult for me to judge this on its own knowing how much I enjoy the 12 and especially the 18."

The nose is wonderful, but the palate comes up short.  At 40% ABV it is also easy to drown. Only added a drop to release the tension. If I was to guess I would say this malt is about 5-6 years old. All in all $36 for a bottle of Highland Park DNA, not terrible but for not much more you can get the 12."

I'm not a fan of peaty scotch.  I received this in a blind tasting box from a friend. The peat is just too strong for me and I would not purchase. I guess for the price of $35 in NC it's okay for what it is.

The first time I tried it, I was not a fan, I thought it was too heavily peated and couldn’t taste anything but. The second time around, I am much more impressed. The peat is definitely still pronounced both in the nose and palate, I can’t imagine how some think it is lightly peated. However, I can now pick up on the sweetness and other slight flavors and find myself appreciating the more subtle things. This couldn’t be more true with the finish, at first, I only get the peat but give it time and it becomes more fruity and the peat all but disappears. This one has opened me to the possibilities of trying more heavily peated options and all and all, I’m glad I have this one in my collection."

After going through 2 bottles and now on my 3rd I can say this is probably the best bang for buck you will find.   It has a lot of the same character of the 10 and the 12 but for less money.   Even though the intensity is dialed down, it's still a satisfying malt.   

On the nose is sulphuric sherry, classic hp campfire peat, brown sugar, bit of a waxy note like old school pioneer candles wax, slight vanilla and mild menthol. 

on the palate you can expect more of the same... However that classic Highland park peat is the first note I pick up followed by the sherry, a good amount of maturity for an NAS, but a bit bitter on the finish.   Maybe a little thin but for 40% it's quite acceptable.  

For the price there isn't much to complain about...A very good entry level malt from Highland Park."

3.0,"slightly smokey but also sweet, a little thin"
3.25,"Until yesterday, I had no idea that this product existed. I assumed that the Highland Park 12 was their entry level offering. While browsing in an ABC in a neighboring County, saw this one on sale for $36 (regularly $40) and decided to give it a try. 
APPEARANCE: Pale straw color. A quick swirl formed slow moving legs on the inside of my Glencairn.
NOSE: Enjoyable. Notes of Citrus and Sherry. Light sugary/doughy sweetness. Like a glazed fruit pastry. It hints at peat, but it's definitely not a strong medicinal note.In fact, if I wasn't already aware that it was there, I may miss it completely. The longer it stays in the glass, the more the Fruit and Sherry notes begin to dominate. There is an unrefined quality here. A little alcohol, which is surprising given its 80 proof.
NEAT: Fairly Heavy and Oily. Not overly complex with vanilla, honey, apple and an astringent note that while prominent, doesn't ruin it. The unrefined quality I noticed in the nose transfers to the palate as well. The Peat shows up on the finish. Not overpowering at first, but it does build the more you drink it. A nice jolt of heat at the end with peat, sugary sweetness and a light salty character coating and lingering on the palate. Think salted caramel.
SPLASH: Amps up the peat on the nose. Turns the palate toward chocolate covered cherries. The peat on the finish is a little more ash.
VERDICT: This was a little rough around the edges for me. Not as smooth and polished as the 12 Year. I really think that this could use a little more higher aged stock in the blend. I had another pour in a small rocks glass with a large cube and it was good that way as well. Something I've never done with a single malt. I plan on enjoying this bottle and if I see it on sale again (@ $36 it was only a couple dollars more than some of the nicer blends) I may pick up another."

2.75,"Smoky, but too simple. Nothing special about this one."
3.5,"My thoughts echo the expert review here. Sweet honey with a touch of smoke on the palate. Tasty but not overly complex. Dry short finish. Good option for those to try who are new to scotch.

4.5,"Classic Highland Park, full flavor, Hilda up to the 18 yrar. Dates, honey, smokey all delicately balanced and not overbearing, a long delightful finish."
3.25,"Edit: update at bottom

Tried neat and then with rocks.

Nose:
Brown sugar, citrus zest. Faint mineral spring at end. Not terribly complicated but dont let that subtract.

Palate:
It's like someone took the interesting parts out of HP12. Vanilla, marmalade -> cereal highland signature, strong spice to finish. Stronger than expected spice for how unassuming it is all the way to this point. The smoke is faint after it gets in your mouth a decent bit but some of it is nice to taste initially--this one is kinda boring.

Finish:
Hot but not in a cheap liquor or ethanol tasting way. Short, short, short. Spice kinda gives a little kick of heather and cinnamon. Forgettable if you've had enough better stuff from the category but I wouldnt ever dare snub a dram or three.

Bought on a whim for $29.99 while looking around the store with the wife. I had read and heard it was okay but drinkable; I'd personally state it as ""bland and boring"". It isnt deserving of much praise or criticism.

Spend the extra $8-14 on 12 year. 

82/100.

Edit
83.5 or 84 after it had a few drams poured the bottle sat and the profile was nicely changed. Smoke was easier to enjoy throughout--less sticky sweet in the way of smoke. Me and the wife smelled and tasted rich butter/biscuit whereas before it wasnt pronounced anywhere except a quick kiss in the spice."
1.0,"Probably one of the worst tasting scotches I've ever had. Oily, burnt taste, with a smokey after taste."
3.25,Good beginner scotch for someone just dabbling in peaty flavors. Not too bold or robust flavor profile but smooth to drink.

3.5,A budget whisky that is well worth the price. While not smooth or well balance you get quite a lot going on. Peat but mostly smoke with lemon citrus spiced apple and brown sugar. Definitely some heat reminiscent of cinnamon on the finish that I quite like. Overall I would definitely get again.

4.0,Really solid mildly peated scotch for the price point
3.75,"Tasted neat. More delicate than I expected. Nice nose. First taste coated the tongue. Sweet finish. 
Added 6 drops of water. Not a lot of change. Seemed to enhance the finish sweetness."

3.5,Smooth and mild little bit of peat and smoke not overly complex.  Pretty good not great
4.0,"Sweet grainy aroma. Fruit sweet flavor and grain on the tongue, very nicely balanced with each other. Tastes light and mellow to me, but maybe that's because it's just following an Ardbeg flight. possibly chocolate on the tail. Not as aggressive as I usually like, but can't argue with that flavor balance."
3.25,Not a lot of complexity. Peaty. Oily. Pear. Smooth mouth feel. Not overwhelming. A good dram at this price point tho.

3.5,"Highland Park 12 is rather magnificent.  This is not, but it is good.  It has most of the flavor notes of the twelve:  honey, biscuit, malt, burning autumn leaves.  Being younger it just doesn't seem finished and well rounded like the twelve.  If you can get it for around $28-32 it is worth a try.  Where I live most retailers seem to be trying to cash in on the Highland Park brand name and are chargng nearly the price of the HP 12.  Don't go there!"

3.25,Decently priced single malt. Taste is a bit bland but there is definitely peat to it.
3.75,Really easy drinking. A little thin but great flavor. Perfect amount of peat! Mild sweet finish.
3.25,"Got a sample bottle last week! Time to delve into more Scotch!

This one is a bit thin. The nose has some light peat and lemon. I pick up mostly citrus.
The taste has a bit of peat, smoke, and maltiness along with some floral notes. 

Overall, I thought it was ok. Nothing offensive in it, but nothing outstanding either. Honestly, I liked it best when mixed with some Gozio amaretto liqueur in a Godfather cocktail."

3.25,"Subtle honey and butter on the nose; oak, butter, spice, subtle peat, and a little bitter and astringent; somewhat unctuous; warm and subtly smoky aftertaste"

3.5,Peaty but not smoky. And you can definitely tell it was aged in a sherry cask.
3.25,"A little pepper, a little citrus, a little oak, a little peat. Nothing special but nothing bad. There is a tiny bitter note late and a thin mouth feel. But at $32 a good easy dram for the price."

3.75,"The nose is smoldering candle smoke, with a hint of soft rubber. Blacktop tar. There is a medicinal quality in the aroma; band-aid.

The flavor is mildly smoky, not quite bonfire but dry tobacco. Spicy dried fruit and leather. Boggy moss but the peat is not all that apparent. 

The finish is more light smoke. White pepper and a hint of sea salt. The peat comes out a tad as it lingers. A solid value."
3.5,"Single smooth scotch. Heavy on the peat. Can’t tell from the nose. Sweet at first, fade with a light smoke. Pleasant drink. Definitely worth the cost."
