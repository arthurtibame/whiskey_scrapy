2.0,"9/23/16 Grape & Grain Liquors, Kerrville, TX
$76.99

Love seeing an offering from Texas with promise, but this one is young and far from being worth the price for the taste. Pay for the experience and colectibility now and the flavors will come."

3.0,"Day 10. Sorry I'm late, had guests...again. At least they brought Rum. Good Rum. Today we got a Texas Whiskey. And unfortunatly, another disappointing bourbon. On the nose, there is banana. A lot óf it. Some Corn, oak, and caramelizing sugar. Not quite caramel, not quite sugar, somewhere in between. Taste is very bitter, oak spices, brown sugar. Not very smooth, this one fights you going down. After a while there are some dark chocolate notés. Short, sugary aftertaste. Not to my liking, but even whisky you don't like is worth trying just for the sake of expieriencing variety. There are better bourbons out there, at least in my opinion."

1.0,"No thanks, ordered a pour via a recommendation.  It has that “play doh” noise as do most young bourbons, keep it in the barrel another 8 years or so :("

leather / peanut butter carries through from aroma, hot, medium high sweetness carries into finish"

2.0,"Oak, some stone fruit, and a burn on the finish; very light body; with water, more oak, and turpentine"
1.0,"i have had a few glasses after a visit to the distillery, which is beautiful, however, the whiskey produced in hye is not of top quality. at $80+ a bottle I expectantly more complex and flavorful whiskey. this bottle offers spice and smoke, not much else. at this price point, you can buy 2 bottles of 10 year old single malt"
4.0,"Nose:corn and slight brown sugar are expressed. Second smell: thanks to comments...bananas. Most evident corn followed by banana. Palate: Sweet with slight bite, cornmeal and vanilla exert themselves. Finish: smooth as molasses and we'll rounded, lingering cornmeal makes me picture Texas Cornfields and sunshine. Chainsaw Massacre not included."

4.0,"Tasting the 2018 Spring Release. 
This Bourbon just never disappoints. I have really enjoyed every release I have tried.
Upon entry you get a pronounced cereal note with some brown sugar. It then rolls over to some mild baking spices with some toffee. Finish is long with some oak and heat. Lovely dram. Complexity defies is short 3 yrs of aging. 
The price point is high, but this is for sure different and very, very drinkable. Solid 4/5."
4.5,"A little hot with a rich caramel, very well balanced.  Suitable neat, rocks, or mixed."
3.75,"Sweet corn, nose was leather early.
Medium heat and finish that’s sweet cereal corn vanilla 
Solid
I tasted the 2018"

2.5,I got the 2019. Odd taste (almost foul) at first. Then sweet caramel which helped. This will probably get better in time. There are many other whiskeys (Texas ones at that) I’d buy up to this price point of $80+ before I’d get this again

3.0,Tried this and the 2016. Both had a big clay-like flinty taste. I found it really off-putting. Probably the biggest disappointment of the year. I had very high expectations
