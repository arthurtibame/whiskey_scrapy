3.0,"The nose is sweet with white chocolate and marshmallow readily apparent, along with more traditional Green Spot notes of apple. The palate is more subtle with orchard fruits and marzipan giving way to a straightforward finish of dry wine and Pot Still spice. Not a bad addition to the Green Spot family."

5.0,"Nose: Right of the bat you get a very soft aroma, it's not harsh for being a non chill filtered whiskey. It has the essence of vanilla as with most whiskey but there is also a subtle amount of cherries and pomegranate in the air. There is an amount of baked sugar there or burnt even but there is a good amount of toast here. That sweet nose of orchard fruits from the standard Green Spot also make their appearance as well. A touch of wood spice comes through in the middle and end. 

Taste: Dangerously smooth. The wine influence is strong here and the pot still spice is married harmoniously with red berries, toasted marshmallows, and a nuttiness close to almonds. That banana bread feel transforms into richer fruits and spices creating a rather complex whiskey. There is that creamy vanilla also with a faint sensation of mapple in the background with flecks of cinnamon present. 

Finish: Wonderfully lengthy. There was a slight sense of dry chocolate on the exit with the tingle of the spices dancing out. More orchard fruits show up too. It's the kind of finish you always want to come back to and visit again and again and again."

5.0,"Great stuff with notes of green apples, caramel apples, vanilla, white chocolate, dried fruit, strawberries, marshmallows, with pot still spices following up on the creamy palette and long finish. Like it more than red spot, would love to try the Bordeaux finish."

5.0,I like this better than the Leoville-Barton.  Well-defined dark vanilla and chocolate.
