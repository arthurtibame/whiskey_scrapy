4.0,"2 fingers on an ice ball. Has nice flavor, pretty hot like a pepper or cinnamon type burn. Can taste the vanilla and caramel. Some wood flavor is in the mix. Bottom line, it’s very drinkable."

4.0,"this is a rye for those timid or to scared to drink rye. Crazy spice when it hits your round. like a Bazar came to town poured all the spice in your punch. There is a fair amount of ethanol in the glass, I have found a half teaspoon of distilled water in a healthy pour let it sit for about 5 to 7 min and it dissapates pretty well. Smooth on the butt end I mean no burn at all. this type of drink is what I call an Uh ohh drink. After a few hours with the bottle you fine half of it gone and you're looking at your spouse and can only say ""Uh Ohh""

there is vanilla, and some berry laying hidden in here. you find it by swishing it in your mouth and letting your gum tell you where they are hiding. 

Everyone knows how much I love rye... I do really. And this Texas brew really make my rye tingle... try it out it is a Spirits Direct at Total Wine with a 5 coupon you can get it for 30-32 bucks..."
2.25,"There's some good flavor, but it's still really angry for a bourbon. Maybe a few more years in a barrel would help, but I'm not entirely convinced. 

Their national campaign will be interesting, but I doubt they'll succeed."

3.0,"very rye at first. slow burn. vanilla and oak. a little shallow on notes on the back.  i live in texas, Austin proper, and feel texas bourbons are way too young at this point and a little gimicky on the release. this is 90 proof, so, your going to be feeling good with a double.  i wouldnt buy a bottle of this, but i would drink it if its there."
