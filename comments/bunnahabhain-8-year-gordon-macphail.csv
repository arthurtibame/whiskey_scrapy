4.5,"Heavily peated.  Heavily smoked.  Short, sweet finish, some mild sour and strong spice on the tongue, quite warming, but not hot.  Very smooth for an 8 yr."

C&B 9/16. Smell smoked meat. Front citrus. Back bitter chocolate. Subtle peat. Much nicer after 30 min for its gentle peat but not memorable."

I’m sorry, but Bunnahabhain to me should always be well sherried and briney – like taking Glendronach and blending it with Old Pulteney.  This G&M young, peated ex-sherry Bunna is nothing like the house style, and, I must say, is disappointing even at its low price and no frills independent bottling.

Gordon & MacPhail is not exactly your precious snowflake of an independent bottler that needs our support or protection.  They put out more bottles than many Scottish distilleries, and I fully expect them to shrug every now and again, and just put out mediocre, generic stuff.  This is a generic dram that was bottled too immature, and without a real purpose.  It’s flat cereal, flat fruits, with peat that’s not particularly interested in picking up the slack and dominating the palate.  Where is the brine?  Where are the spices?  I just feel a little more wood oils from a more active cask or longer maturation would bring out more flavors.  This fails to highlight the pros of a young whisky.  It’s drinkable, I guess; just horribly uninspired.

MARK: 75/100.
Not recommended"
