3.0,"Sweet, granular, and nutty. Fairly straightforward, which isn't a bad thing. I really enjoy it in a highball with a lemon wedge."

3.0,"Had a pour of this at a bar. By the end of the glass it reminded me of a lightly malted Irish whisky blend. It's drinkable but nothing great. 
I'm a bourbon drinker mostly so this one was light on the tongue. 
For the 3 different barrel finishes being blended together my rookie tasting tongue couldn't taste a lot of complexity. I could only pick up the malted wheat."
4.0,"Smooth complex whiskey for a young age.  Nose smells like it could take paint off the wall, but it is smooth and lacks the burn you would expect with the aroma.  Nice wood and spice accents.  No need to add water or ice to this or it will dilute the taste."

3.0,"Had a bottle of this labeled as being 4 years old and while it was still kicking up like a youngin here and there, it was definitely drinkable. So much toasty rustic white bread on the nose that drinking it comes across as a barely-smeared jam sandwich. Finish is dry herbs that glimmers rather than lingering. A dusty Californian summer afternoon in the garden. Not my favorite but definitely one of the more unique things I've tried."
