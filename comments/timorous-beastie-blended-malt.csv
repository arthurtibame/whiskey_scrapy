3.5,"Inspired by Robert Burns' poem 'To a Mouse', Timorous Beastie is a Highland Blended Malt of Blair Athol, Glengoyne, Dalmore and Glen Garioch. A bit off-putting at first, the nose unfolds with butterscotch and intense floral notes before heather honey, citrus fruits and juniper start to emerge. The taste is surprisingly spicy and gingery, featuring mashed berries, creamy vanilla and a touch of eucalyptus. This little fellow is not shy at all! Fading with milky cereals, licorice and hints of sweet malt, the finish turns slightly dry and nutty. Not bad, I would say.

3.0,"A nose of malt vinegar, mead, pollen and highland peat. Thin oil textured palate. At its core is stewed fruit with shells of vanilla, beeswax, and inland peat. Start to finish this whisky has a bit of a sizzle sensation from the alcohol. The finish is warm and earthy. Fun to pick apart, but I don't know if I'd want to continue to revisit it with a standard sized bottle. I do like that Malt vinegar though."

3.75,"Sweet grassy herbal nose.  Heather, sweet grass, wet straw, spice, slight dry wood.  A bit of peat with lingering dry finish.

Really great nose - this is one of the most herbal whiskeys I've had in recent memory."
3.5,"Grassy, hay, heather.  Herbal, spicy, slightly bitter- light flavors, fairly oily palate.  Definitely a different experience- pleasant and drinkable.  I got it because I loved the name, I'm not going to lie, but it's a pleasant drink as well.  The heather is very pronounced- it's actually exciting to see it so front and center.  If someone were to ask me what heather tasted like, I'd give them a taste of this."

4.5,"Continuing my journey through Douglas Laing core expressions, today i review the spectacular looking bottle, Timorous Beastie, that has a Mouse in the middle of the label to honour a poem called ""to a mouse"" by Robert Burns. 

This is the Highland blended malt from Douglas Laing and it is bottled at 46.8%, made by blending delicious Dalmore, Glengoyne and Glen Garioch. 

On the nose, Dry brown cake, Tobbacco notes,  cigarrettes. Very appealing. 

On the palate, Starts with sweet honey, then it gets a little spicy but wonderfully crafted. Clove and ginger finish, mouth drying, beautifully balanced. 

This Douglas Laing whiskies dont have a lot of notes, but the ones they do have are excelent. I score this baby with a 92 over 100 and i definitively would buy a bottle for  the 45-50 dollars thay ask for it. Slainte!"

0.5,Had the 24 expression. Something seriously off in the bottle. Nose was terrible. Like a corked wine. Not sure WTF was happening. But terrible even when cut with water. Horrible stuff in my one experience.

2.0,"What the hay! Noooo... This is not good. 

Wet hay, with strong bourbon influence (think vanilla and charred oak). It's floral, like your grandmother's terrible perfume, and remarkably weak in body.

Not for me."

3.5,"Not a bad dram. Sorta in the vein of a Glenglassaugh Torfa or Laphroiag Select. Starts of with nice balance of sweet vanilla and mild peat. Fades a bit at the end and the more you drink looking for other flavours, depth or complexity to develop nothing really does. Still not to bad. 3.5 I'll give it. Not in the 4 territory however."
4.0,"North Shore Whisky Club: sweet, very little harshness, not as enjoyable as Epicurean which I had just before, but pretty drinkable. Probably wouldn't buy."
