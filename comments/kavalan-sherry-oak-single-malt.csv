3.75,"- Tastes young but bold
- hotter than you would think
- water really opens this up
- very fruity, fresh fruit
- short to medium finish
- better than its reputation says, but price hurts this"
4.0,"Rich, sweet, fruity. Clean taste, but finishes a little cloying. Easy midweek drink. Drank at home."
3.0,The nose is gorgeous but the taste does not deliver on expectations and I find the finish unpleasantly bitter. Not my fav Kavalan.
3.5,"Oh what a dissapointment. The nose on this dram was magnificent. I thought, ¿will this be another 100 points? But the palate and the aftertaste couldn't live to the aroma. Taiwanese Whisky, sherry oak, my third Kavalan, still not impressed. (I have had the not THAT expensive stuff). 

Bottled at 46%abv, beautiful mahogany color.

On the nose it was perfect. Amazingly complex and super sweet. Strawberries, Red fruits, very winey. Sherried sweet, Toffee, Impalpable sugar, a lovely maraschino cherry juice and a little note of wood polisher.

But then... the palate. It felt too young. Sherry, Almomds, Burnt oak, Nutty flavors , Brown sugar.

Aftertaste was very short. Also a lot of burning sensations. Not good. Clove spice, some young unmatured oakiness. Maybe liquorice. A little unpleasant. It just needs to mature a little more. 

Overall i give this dram a 72 over 100, the nose gave the most points on this one. I might just use my oak barrel to age it a little longer; lets see how that goes."

4.5,"Kavalan sherry oak is definitely my favourite Kavalan so far, and rates high generally! Inviting dark honey colour. Lovely and fruity(dark), with a hum of the oak and it's vanilla tones in support. There's also that sweet baking aroma, similar to scones baking (probably a specific aroma, but I can't put my finger on it). Beautifully oily on the palate and a wonderful warming, dark fruit-filled finish. 
Is it worth the £85 price tag? Yes, I reckon it is, it's definitely 'special occasion whiskey' (or a sneaky one to yourself in front of the fire on a winter night!).
Bravo Kavalan, BRAVO! 👍🤤🥃"

3.0,"Almost too much influence from the Sherry cask.  Tons of dried fruit, very sweet almost syrupy."
4.0,"Got through online shop from NJ after reading some reviews. At first try, really did not like it. Taste was confusing and not really pleasent. Second try I put a splash of cold water and let it rest 5 minutes. Totally different whiskey. Great burn (and long), taste of sherry, sweet/maple, really suprisingly enjoyable late night drink"

3.0,"I was really hoping for something like an old sherry Macallan...not sure why I even had his expectation. Maybe because I thought the tropical climate might make it age quicker and smooth out the rough edges.  Like an Amrut.  But this is no Amrut, and not even close to an old sherry Macallan.  The nose is quite nice---raisins and dried fruit.  The taste isn't bad either...quite floral and fruity.  But what kills it is the finish. You can tell it's young and quite not ready for prime time.   Not sure why the Amruts are smoother...maybe the Bangalore climate ?  Or quality of casks?"

3.0,Meget sherry. Minder ikke så meget om whisky.
2.0,This is heavy on the sherry and it's as strong as the Amrit intermediate sherry but not close in it's delivery. The Amrut was strong but elegant while this was just ok.
3.0,"Eh, it's alright. Maybe it's the climate, but this lost nearly all of the fresh, tropical fruit note that define the Kavalan malt's personality. Instead, this one is just a big, flabby sherry bomb with very little character of its own. Plenty of the usual dried fruit and nut sherry combo, but not too much else kicking around for me. Given the cost that Kavalan's whiskies are selling for in the international market, I'd save my money and spend it on one of their better options."

3.0,"Really liked at WoW, but would need to try again given the price ($140). 2nd comment: I will need to try this a 3rd time, since I found it very phenol-y and didn't like it that much the 2nd time. Had side-by-side with the Ex-Bourbon and preferred that."

4.0,"Nose - Dark cherries dominate, dried currants, bright red dried berries, sweet toasted hazelnuts, hint of toasted coconut, cherry cough syrup at the back end.
Taste - Intense sweet cherry infused dessert wine and white peppercorn spice, lightly dry yet creamy like what coconut milk can do to your mouth.
Finish - Long lingering sweet cherry infused dessert wine with lingering white peppercorn spicy tingle.
Score - 84/100
Final Thoughts - Sherry bomb anyone? The sherry cask finish dominates this a bit too much and hides all of the floral and tropical fruit notes I get from their other offerings. It's fairly one dimensional in that it could almost be a heavily fortified sherry versus a sherry finished whisky. That being said, what is there is still pretty tasty but is something that I'd most likely have to really be in the mood for. I'd say this might pair very well with a dark chocolate dessert."

3.75,"If John Hammond drank this as much as he traveled to various dig sites,  he might not have realized his dream of a dinosaur park.

Smells like raisins and graham crackers. Add some water and it turns into smores. Surprising amount of heat, and very heavy bodied. Does it sort of mute flavors? Yah a bit, but I'd sacrifice a total stranger to a pack of velociraptors, to save a bottle of this."

3.0,"As mentioned by others, a seemingly good whisky on the nose (with very heavy Sherry influence) is completely let down by the finish. The harshness of the finish suggests this is a very young whisky that could have done with more time in a non-sherry cask. A disappointment considering the price."
