Wow! Comme c'est bon!
On est rapidement projeté vers un septième ciel en dégustant ce sublime whisky. Un équilibre digne d'un funambule marchant les yeux fermés sur une corde au-dessus du Grand Canyon. Encore, j'en veux encore. Malheureusement, le prix va certainement m'empêcher d'en avoir toujours une bouteille sous la main."

3.0,"Nose: Toffee, cappuccino, caramel, milk chocolate, leather, intensely berry-flavoured gummy sweets, stewed prunes, a little oak.

Palate: Sweet arrival with red fruits that turns quickly dry - almost astringent - highlighting citrus fruit and hot spices. The development expands on this opening spice note with a burst of spicy, tannic heat (hot cinnamon, nutmeg, clove oil, black pepper). Then a sharply-defined second wave of development arrives with mild wood flavours, brown sugar, lots of berries, red fruits and nuts. The texture is full and heavy.

Finish: Medium/short, and it stops very abruptly. An oaky stewed-fruit compote on the aftertaste.

A curious whisky. Not unpleasant at all but - different. The structure seems somehow strange and there is a touch of sulphur which intrudes just a little on both the nose and palate.  It's not a sherry-bomb and there's not a trace of smoke.  If I had to give it a name I'd call it a ""jammy leather bomb"", if that makes sense.

With water - well, just don't do it. Even a few drops kills it stone cold dead. No nose, barely any palate. It's incredibly fragile.

This was tasted from a sample that I've had for a while, which was poured from one of the early 41% bottlings around 6 years ago when a friend bought a bottle. The sample was overfilled so there was no air bubble and the cap was as tight as a drum so I'm guessing it lasted well. It's certainly an interesting whisky but I feel no desire to find a bottle - however I would like to try a sample of a more recent bottling, particularly the CS tawny port expression. The price I've quoted for it was the price in 2013.

""Above Average"" : 3 stars"
