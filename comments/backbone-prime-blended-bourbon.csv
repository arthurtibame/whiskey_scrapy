4.0,"A lovely sweet/spicy scent that gives you a great insight into some barrel flavor to come. The taste is hot spice up front, and the entire mix will bring out the oils of the barrel if moved around the mouth. The finish takes a while to come down off the spice, but it's a great rounded choice."
