3.25,"Update. I have no idea why I have another sample of this as the last one was decidedly average and I rated a 3 a couldn't get much out of it. I think maybe the initial one was a quick hit at a whiskey tasting perhaps, so this is a calibration tasting to see how accurate the quick hit tastings are. Well pretty good actually...I gave this a 3 which I thought surprising for a 21 yr Benriach but now drinking at leisure I think that wasn't to far off the mark. I don't get how some old aged Benriachs are mind blowing and others quite average. The nose gives me literally nothing not even an ethanol blast. More going on on the palate, sweet vanilla and hints of the port. Maybe more 3.25 to 3.5 territory but if you factored VFM in it'd be a 2."
