3.0,"Deep caramel and orchard fruit on the nose. Unique wood notes as well. On the palate, I first get rubber tires. It's like walking through a tire shop. Sweetness, and rye notes, a brief flash of spice that goes away. Short finish. There's a unique flavor that I can only describe as fragrant wood and petroleum products. So it's interesting. Will need to see how this changes over time. A few drops of water brings out caramel notes, and some astringent notes. 12/11/17
The rubber notes have waned but they're still there on the front end. More intense flavors on the front end that I remember. Still lots of wood. Mid palate is really good. But finish is short. 1/25/18"

4.0,"Slightly hot, very nice!"
3.0,"The ""molten cherry/wood club to the jaw"" notes here reminded my friend and I of Stagg Jr, but at a lower firepower proof level. Adding the barest shake of water ups the base sweetness, breaking that double-barreled oak shotgun with a hint of maple syrup plus sawdusty sweet potatoes on the nose. A lovely drink; very different than the dearly departed 18 year bottle we bought this to replace."

5.0,Especially smooth with hints of caramel and toffee.  Long lasting after taste that cries out for more.
4.0,"Oaky nose.   Palate: vanilla, barrel char, baking spices.  Finish: leather, more vanilla.  Great pour!"

5.0,"This is down right elegant and smooth.  A drink for royalty.   It’s full bodied with the flavor complexity you’d expect from 16 years in oak and begs to be sipped passionately all-night long.  The flavor profile bursts with loads of Carmel, vanilla and sweet burnt sugars on the palette while the finish is creamy and long with hints of oak, Carmel and tones of fresh tobacco."

4.5,"Nose- well balanced sweet and spicy with orange and sugar with a hint of rye black pepper
Body- Lots of tingle. What proof is this?! Really nice mix of rye pepper and sugary sweetness.
Finish- the sweetness continues with notes of rich sweet tea and orange marmalade. There are herbal/ floral notes there and they go very well with the sweetness. This is delicious. 

Enjoyed this after the maiden voyage of Dee’s Permission with Travis and Dan."

Good complexity with a perfect balance of oak, sweetness, and heat."
