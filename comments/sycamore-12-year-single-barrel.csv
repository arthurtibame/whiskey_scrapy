2.25,"Wish I knew more about this one, but I'm sure it's sourced and I highly doubt it is a single malt.

So if you've had their standard 10 year, you'll really know most of these notes.

Nose - Sweet butter scotch, some vanilla, nearly no overt oak, but light tannins at the end. There is still some pretty distinct spirt here. This reminds me almost of a grain alcohol out of scotland. A bit more buttery and rich than perhaps a scotch would be at the same age. 

Taste - The flavor is richer and more buttery but really it has all the same flavors from the nose. Butter scotch BOMB. That I really like is after about 2 months open it's really mellowed out. The 53% which opened hot is now very approachable. While oddly I think the 40% regular release is the one I'd rather have on the bar as this is just a sipper where you want an easy drinker without any real flaws, the 12 year CS brings with it more flavor but really just bigger flavor. I'm not sure it is really different in those flavors, I'm not sure the 12 years did a LOT...perhaps some more oak and chocolate might be peaking in. 

Anyway, I really enjoy this but at 80, it's a bit over priced. I like supporting the locals efforts. 2.25, this is just a very mellow easy sipper."
