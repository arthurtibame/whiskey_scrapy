3.0,"One of the least interesting malts of Scotland. It's no surprise that the bulk of this stuff ends up in Johnnie Walker given how nondescript and middle-of-the-road it is. Tart nose, with sour apples, sharp oak, and some intense floral notes. Slight smoke, lemon zest, alcohol bite even at 40% ABV, honey, grass, and hay. Thin taste that's initially quite sweet (apples, vanilla), with more smoke than expected. Then some real bite. Citrus tang? Pepper? Herbal notes, maybe something planty or floral. Short, dry finish. A real ""meh"" for me: it's decently well-rounded, and more floral than some of those better known, fruitier Speysides, but it's shockingly overpriced. Truth be told, about the most interesting thing about Cardhu is tracing the effect it has on the Johnnie Walker line-up (I always thought the smoke of JW Black was all Talisker, but it actually seems like Cardhu is doing a lot of the heavy lifting here)."

3.0,"A nice but quite plain one. Bread, sawdust, fallen leaves and some speysider flowerness in the nose. Tastewise same bread and oak with some syrup and some sweet fruits. Warm, but disappointing short finish.
All in all, taste on occasion, but once. 83/100"
3.0,"Nose: Subtle and sweet. Like a rich fragrance of apples and pears. Nice notes of malted barley.

Taste: Apples and pears still dominate with barley in the back. Soft peat and very small hints of smoke.

Finish: Starts with sweet notes that turn into dryness. Wee smoke in a fast way.

Balance: Smooth and round, well in balance. Easy to drink. Sweetness and dryness meet nicely each other."

3.0,"Game 5 in full swing and needing the win. Looking for a light and sweet after dinner dram and pulled this from the cabinet. Floral and honey notes along with some ripe pears come across light and sweet on the nose. The honey notes become more dominant as it opens.  Very light texture on the palate. The honey and fruity sweetness quickly arrives and fades transitioning to a malty barley and into the finish.  Some oaky dryness remains.  Balanced well, more sweet than dry, but not overly sweet. Easy to drink and enjoyable and uncomplicated.  Good starter scotch.  Not a bad one to have in a collection and priced rather reasonably.  A beach house scotch?  Maybe.  (Christmas gift).  [86/100].

If you really dig into this one you might find some nuts and a faint smoke as well. When you take a sip you first experience sweet apricots.

3.0,"I never quite understood why Cardhu is so popular in Spain. Maybe it's the warm climate that goes well together with the light and fruity style of this Single Malt? On the nose, you get juniper berries, sticky honey sweetness and hints of almonds - that's it. Not unpleasant, but fairly simple. The taste is a plain continuation of the aroma with some mild spices, fresh spearmint and dark chocolate in the second row. Be careful with water, as this malt disintegrates quickly. With its swift and undemanding finish, Cardhu 12 is an easy sipper for long summer evenings.

The palate is where I get the sherry notes and slight peat smoke. I'll be honest, the first dram of this yesterday did not appeal much to me, but now on the second day, it's MUCH better. Maybe that's a sign that oxidation helps this glass. This is a base core offering, and a great one. No water needed, and the finish reminds me of orange peel/marmalade with candied sugar. A nice medium mouth coat. 3.75, and thanks Paul for the chance to admire it. The song for this dram is ""Don't You Forget About Me"" by Simple Minds."

4.0,"This is surprisingly good.  I never heard of Cardhu, despite it being a key Johnnie Walker component.  Graciously supplied by Paul as part of our trading team, this is a sheer delight to have.  More suited for a warm humid summer night than the dropping fall temperatures.  But, heck, I'll take it.   Light and fruity, with a touch of green tea.  Inoffensive, like a more humble Balvenie.  Worthwhile to pick up.  Thanks Paul"

4.0,"It’s been a rough few nights at work lately and I need to get back on track with the other guys in our tasting group.  So, I randomly grabbed a sample and plopped down on the couch.  I poured the Cardhu 12, graciously supplied by Paul, into the Glencairn and leaned back to rest my eyes for a bit.  Well, a bit became 35 minutes before I snapped back to life.  Gotta give it time to breath, yeah- that’s the ticket...

The juice is a wonderful, light gold in color and giving a spin leaves a full sticky oil slick around the entire inside of the taster.  I caught a quick whiff of honey and vanilla before I set it back down.  The full nosing experience is sort of unremarkable if you’re looking for complexity.  It’s a Speysider filled with sweet honey, some tropical fruits and light oak barrel notes.  Pleasant, for sure.

The palate is all toffee-covered tropical fruit.  The oily look in the glass isn’t really present on the tongue, but the vanilla really lingers more than anything else I’ve detected to this point.  The 40% ABV doesn’t add any heat and there’s little to no warmth lingering into the finish.  I can see why this stuff is used heavily by Johnnie Walker.  There is no way anyone can be offended by this malt.  It’s fruity and very light.

The finish is lightning quick with just more honey sweetness ringing through.  It’s a true warm weather malt that would leave you still shivering on a brisk, autumn evening.  I can’t find anything wrong with this one.  It ticks off all the typical Speyside bullet points and is perfect for chilling with friends and enjoying a whisky session.  3.5-3.75 stars.  Thanks again Paul.  Solid stuff."

4.0,"​I was looking for something a little different and Cardhu is what I came up with. This Speysider turns out to be a major component in Johnnie Walker, to the extent that JW bought the distillery outright some time ago. It's now one of Diageo's brands. It was also at the center of a firestorm of controversy back in the 80's when Diageo attempted to address a supply crisis by turning it into a vatted malt and calling it ""Pure Malt"". The shitstorm that ensued nearly wiped out the distillery. Fortunately Diageo saw the light and restored the brand to a single malt that is available to us today.
Cardhu 12 yr. is bottled at a standard 40% ABV. It's a light to medium gold in the glass, which makes me think it is not colored. No statement as to whether or not it's filtered, so I assume it is. It looks thin in the glass and produces thin legs.
The nose is very light, which follows the appearance. Light floral and cereal tones, along with light citrus, apples and pears. That's about it. So far, not too impressive.
The palate was a little surprising. I found it fairly dry for a Speysider, with a strong peppery/cinnamon spice flavor. Actually kind of reminded me of a rye whiskey at first, which is really strange, but that's what I got. Water brought out some malty flavors. It had a fairly thin mouthfeel. Pretty one dimensional; or maybe I just can't get those light ""barely there"" notes. Whichever, it was good, but not great.
The finish was probably the best part of this dram. Warm, lingering, and reminiscent of dark fruit cake, the finish saves this whisky from being purely mediocre. The odd combination of fruity nose with spicy palate throws it off balance. It would be a good summer whisky; alas, summer is over and I'm looking forward to richer, smokier stuff. And at $55-60, I have a hard time recommending it. It's not bad, but you can get better for your money. 3.75/5.0. Cheers!"

4.0,"Stop number 31 on the SDT is Cardhu. This Speyside distillery provides one of the key malts in the Johnnie Walker blends (although it does not appear the Green Label). This 12 year old is bottled at 40% ABV and has enough colorant in it to make it look like JW Black Label. It appears to also be chill filtered. At one time (and it may still be), this was the best selling single malt scotch in Spain. Let's see what all the Spaniards are making such a fuss about. 

On the nose it is heavy with honey and cereal malt. It immediately screams JW. Pears, plums, soft oak and wood resin. There is melon and maybe some strawberries, peaches and dull oranges. Very grassy as well but in a very good way. Light nuts, maybe hazelnut and some old cardboard. Toffee, vanilla and faint cocoa powder. Some cinnamon and possibly another type of wood spice, ginger or maybe licorice with a sort of mocha note trailing off. I thought for a moment that there was a beautiful smoky BBQ aroma, but alas it was one of my neighbors grilling up dinner. 

Heather honey all over the palate. Floral with weak black tea and light milk chocolate. Malty sweet with a little pepper that builds up just enough to make you take notice. Banana, oak, toffee and vanilla. Very interesting and engaging. 

A medium to light body. A little creamy, but turns very dry. 
The finish, unfortunately, is rather short. Sweet with oak and pepper and a puff of smoke that fades as quickly as it appears. 

I have to say that I am quite impressed. I went into this one seeing the heavy colorant and legal minimum strength and expected the worst. What I got was a solid single malt with a strength that transcends its ABV. Very well balanced. It shows like a true 12 year old, some complexity with a little youthful kick. I would love to have a go at this one at cask strength. If you are a fan of Johnnie Walker you will probably enjoy this. Again, very impressed at this colored, chill filtered, 40% Speysider. This may turn into one of those must have on hand for guests type of scotches. Others may think I'm crazy for giving it a 4, but I'm looking at all the things it has going against it and still coming out on top. Plus, at $50 it's a damn good value for money. 
Cheers, MFers!"

2.0,"Day 8 of my 2017 advent. Spicy, flat, non-scotch scotch. Not terrible, but not good."

Palate: smooth, gentle, and warm. sweetness, honey, nuttiness, soft oak throughout, a subtle fruity finish entices another sip leaving a silky sensation behind.

Light on the tongue. A darker honeyed color.

It’s not the boldest Speyside, but it’s classic and inviting nonetheless. A really great expression for everyone - whisky newcomers and connoisseurs alike!"

F: plain, bordering on boring, vanilla, oak, and the tiniest hint of ash.

O: perhaps something in my handling of the sample, but this did not live up to my memory of it from a 2014 happy hour. Average entry level malt, bordering on sub-par. Worth a revisit. (50/100)."

Ultimately Cardhu seems to be in the Glenmorangie 10 end of the spectrum, with orange peel, flowers, and honey. But it doesn't have the formers depth or sunshine in a bottle quality. It's pleasant but not notable."

- Color is pale gold.
- On the nose I get some sweet notes such as  vanilla and floral notes such as honey suckle. They are followed by the fruit notes: pineapple and pears.
- On the palate it's a rich fruity taste that includes pineapples, mangos and a hint of bananas with the sweetness of honey and vanilla.
- The finish is delicate, and in the most part presents honey and raisins.

Overall, I like this scotch. It's very good value for money and could be used to present whisky to other people who aren't into this spirit that much."

At the risk of either sounding snobby or like a drunk, most drams at 40% abv (maybe with the exception of Redbreast 12) don’t do much for me anymore. Not enough flavor. If this were stronger I could see it having more backbone and being an interesting malt."

The finish is quite short, and leaves an aftertaste of wood and pepper, kind of like a well seasoned tongue depressor."

On the nose you get strong herbal notes, no vanilla, lots of spices and an orange chocolate aroma. I also got almonds and light caramel on it.

Very well balanced, on the palate is fairly good, with lots of oakyness, and there is a smoke hint somewhere but it is hidden. The balance between spicyness and sweetness is very good, its gentle, medium bodied and the finish is medium also, pleasant and spicy. Good dram, worth my while."
