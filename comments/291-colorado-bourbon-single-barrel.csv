4.5,"Appearance: This delicious whiskey has a dark brown leather color with very thin mostly viscous legs.

Nose: The nose is quite complex! It takes one on a journey through familiar notes of dusty corn, cinnamon, brown sugar, vanilla, molasses, and cocoa, as well as more unique findings like smoke, black grapes, pear, boiled carrots, and a light polyurethane note. With a splash of water, notes of wildflowers, honey, and more caramel come forward.

Taste: The palate is bitey and rough but delicious - a cowboy’s bourbon. Notes consist of caramel, brown sugar, maple, wood tannins, BBQ char, and pineapple.

Finish: There is a long sugary and nearly minty finish, making this bourbon ideal for a julep.

Thoughts: On my shelf is bottle number 39 of 56, of barrel 387 (for the nerds like me). In my opinion this versatile bourbon is perfect neat, in an old fashioned, or in a mint julep. It’s the Robin Williams of bourbon: multifunctional and a strong act. I love it all and am a big fan of this juice! Distillery 291 has yet to disappoint me and I highly recommend anyone to hunt down a bottle. 291, thanks again, guys! Cheers!"
3.0,"Mildly preferable to the rye but still pretty average. Younger,  slightly rougher and nothing complex going on.  Really not sure how this distillery won awards..."
