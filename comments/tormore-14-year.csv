4.0,"One of Scotland's hidden distilleries from Speyside. Tormore is part of Pernod Ricard's portafolio, a great malt. 

Bottled at 43%abv. 

On the nose: Almonds, Vanilla, Heather and Chocolate. 

On the palate, Dark chocolate, Heather, Ashy and Peanuts. Aftertaste is mixture of heather and pepper.

Overall this is a very nutty / chocolate dram with a pleasant spiciness to it. My score for it is 84/100."
