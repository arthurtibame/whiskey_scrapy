5.0,This bourbon is amazing! Let it sit with a couple cubes for 3m so you don't burn your esophagus up. It changes as you drink it... It's one of the more complex bourbons I have tried.

4.0,Everything bourbon is suppose to be.  Much smoother than the proof would lead you to believe.  I drank it neat after letting it air for awhile.  Strong vanilla and toffee flavors with a bit of leather.  Definitely a must have.

4.0,"Tasted neat. Really enjoyable nose with dark fruit notes under a perfect Bourbon scent. Taste was smoother than I expected at proof, with spice emerging and eventually bringing in the heat of 127 proof. Really well balanced for strength with underlying oak. Imagine some water or ice would open this up a lot. Solid Bourbon!"

4.0,"Be prepared for some heat, and make sure you add ice or water. The nose has the typical leather and vanilla notes. Drinking neat makes it really difficult to find much flavor besides vanilla. With some ice, the leather comes on strong with the oily taste and the vanilla. It finishes very hot as well, which is a little disappointing because the flavors are very smooth in the middle."
5.0,"Really enjoying this with my cousin. We added water and it really opened up. Smooth, full, a bit spicy, lots of vanilla and oak notes. Hmmm, better put a few of these on the shelf while the price is OK."

5.0,"The first time I had this, it shocked me with its strength and intense flavor. Overwhelming, but so... good. Five months later, and I appreciate it even more. Nose of roasted nuts, wood, vanilla, and alcohol heat. You definitely feel the proof, but the flavor is also strong. This is the Beam flavor profile on steroids. Nuts, honey, spice on the palate. Backend is all leather. The warmth is there going down all the way to the stomach, but not as crazy as expected given the proof and the 2x4 that hits you in the face when you first take a sip. Adding a limestone water ice cube brings out even more peanuts and nocino on the nose, tames the heat and heightens the sweetness a bit on the palate. But I recommend taking this straight. It's a force, enjoy the ride. 3/12/17"

5.0,"Paid $49.99 @ Costco in Jan 2017. 
Bought 2 bottles and regret not buying more. This in my opinion is the best batch of Booker's in years. Probably since Big Man Small Batch. So big, rich, oily, sweet and spicy all in one beautiful Bourbon. It is a tad hot and I found myself enjoying this batch with ice. My typical preference is near but find this one improves with mineral water or ice. If you happen to be insanely lucky and find this batch, buy it."

3.0,"I have to admit, this stuff is too hot for my taste. At 127.9 proof, a few more years of aging could potentially make this quite enjoyable. Straight out of the bottle however, this will melt your face. Even with a few drops of water, the heat is really intense, taking away from the elements and leaving your tongue feeling punished for a crime it didn't commit. Is it fun? Yes, but fun like ""I'm jumping in this pool with all my clothes on because I've got a change of clothes in the car and won't have to deal with wet chafing in the next 10 minutes"" is fun. You want the laughs, the reaction and the memories but also want to dry off quickly. With this bourbon, you want the laughs, the reaction and the memories but also want this dram to stop punching you in the face sooner than later."

5.0,"Nose: Bright, citrusy start that evolves into seriously rich dried dark fruit,  salted chocolate, light caramel and some wispy smoke. 8.5
Palate: Phenomenal immediately. The perfect amount of richness, sweetness, and depth of flavor. Water doesn't change much other than to mellow it out a bit. Not needed, but doesn't take anything away. 9.5
Finish: Rice Crispies, orange rind, and cinnamon bring things home. Not excessively long. 7

3.75,"Second sit down and taste with this one and the second tasting re-affirms my first.  This is a STRONG offering.  Letting it breathe off some of the ethanol and adding some water opens up some thick caramel, butterscotch, fruit (strikes me as grapey) and oak.  But this is a spicy rye forward  sip from the get go not to be trifled with.  Newbies will hate it because it will seem too strong.  It is a veteran dram and one you want to spend some time with to really appreciate.  It is not any everyday bourbon it is a big gun and is a great barrel proof offering.  As close as you will ever get to drinking right out of the barrel.  Has that gritty, frontier man whiskey feel to it.  I like it, I (don't exactly) love it.....I want some more of it."

3.75,"Taste:  Glen cairn glass with one small ice cube.

Nose (3.5):  Boozy nose with alot of vanilla and ethanol.  Spicy and bold.  Wafted neatly before the ice gives some brown sugar.

Palate (4.0):  Vanilla and rye forward.  Spiciness gives way to a rugged leather.  The more it sits the better it gets.

Finish (3.75):  Long finish.  Gives a little bit of flat coca cola on the back end along with some cinnamon.  Stays with you for awhile"
5.0,"This is a quite staggeringly potent bourbon. That means rich caramel, warm honey and a massive kick of alcohol. Even before you sip, the nose burns, albeit with a high grapey sweetness. Then it fills your mouth with a spicy, buttery, oaky deliciousness that stays and stays. This is the biggest, baddest American whisky I’ve ever had. Simply amazing."

4.5,"Found a bottle of the 2016 at my local store, and just had to grab it. My first experience with Bookers, and I hope it’s a good one. 

Look: Bookers comes out damn near brown, definitely a dark dark amber, with the edges showing some slight yellow. The proof-age show with the color. Twirling the glencairn, I don’t see a lot of alcohol legs, but there is some, and lacing that looks like it’s defying gravity. 

Nose: I don’t even have my nose up to the glass, and I’m getting some good aroma.  Tons of sugar, brown sugar, vanilla, smells really sweet. Sticking my nose in the glass gives me more spice, but not a pepper, more a sweeter clove, slight cinnamon, then a nice milder oak. 

Palate: Initial flavor is that sweet sugary flavor, and then in a split second it goes to spice, and oak. After the oak I get hit with more sweetness, maybe cherries. 

Finish: Holy Christ, the first three seconds of this, I thought this was like a milder proof bourbon, and then, the heat hits big time. More so than after the swallow, the heat really hits more on the tongue and mid palate. Finish is the cherry and oak.

Overall: I was expecting a lot out of this, considering how much Beam likes to charge for these bottles, and I’d say expectations are about what I’d expected.  You’re getting a high proof bourbon with tons of flavor, and while the burn is intense, not as much as I’d have expected. Definitely worth grabbing."

4.25,"Rested 10 minutes. Served neat in a Glencairn.

Nose - plum, cherry, vanilla, a little sting on the backend 
Palette - gives you this dark chocolate cherry kick, baking spice, oily, coats the palette and makes room for the finish
Finish - if there was a chocolate red hot? Lol. I imagine that would taste like this. A nice lingering finish that makes you want more

Really great but lacks some complexity that I’m looking for, which is gonna keep it from being one of the best I’ve had."
4.0,"Spice, full flavored, bold"
5.0,"If you've read any of my previous Booker's reviews, you'll know I'm a huge fan. When I find a dusty bottle from years gone by, it's pretty much an automatic purchase. So when I saw this Booker's Bluegrass in a small liquor store that I happened upon by chance, it was an immediate buy.

This is the first of 6 batches from 2016. At this point it's a rarity. Bottled at 63.95%, it's just shy of being the strongest Booker's I've had to date (Kitchen Table and Bluegill Creek are 64%). It's 6 years and 11 months on the dot, which is slightly above average based on what I've had in the past. Enough about all that, on to the tasting.

Nose: The first thing I notice is a massive amount of baking spices. Waves of nutmeg, clove, and allspice. Behind that is cinnamon and ginger, the latter of which I've never gotten in Booker's before. Classic Beam peanut brittle and caramel, as well as cocoa, brown sugar, and vanilla. Some cherry and new car leather. A touch of pipe tobacco, and as always, a hefty serving of oak. Superb start.
*Some apple pie in the empty glass.


Palate: Upon entry it's all leather. Beyond that is more peanut brittle, brown sugar, and caramel. An absolute whopper. All of the spices are in tact; it's another surge cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and allspice. A bit of ginger and black pepper. In addition to peanut, there's also walnut and toasted almond. Maybe even bitter/sweet dark chocolate. And, of course, loads of oak. It's absolute juggernaut, and can be overpowering if you're not ready, but is as complex and intriguing as any other bourbon I've had.

Finish: Cinnamon, black pepper, nutmeg, clove, and allspice. Wave after wave. It's an absolute spice bomb. I also get some cocoa, caramel, and brown sugar. Finally, oak. About as long a finish as you can imagine. It's been 2-3 minutes and I'm still getting hit with a periodic sensation of spice and oak. It's absurb--in a good way.

What a find. I consider myself lucky to have stumbled upon this piece of history. At $71, I'd pay for this all day. Sadly, I doubt I'll ever have the privilege of buying another. 5 stars. It's as good as any other Booker's batch I've had.

I had the chance to conduct a side-by-side comparison between this and the Center Cut batch before finishing the latter. That was the most unique and interesting Booker's I had have had to date, and, overall, this Bluegrass held up on even footing. Every batch is worth the trouble for a different reason. All near-perfect pours. I love the aggressive, spicy, and oaky nature that this one exhibits. Buy on sight, people."
