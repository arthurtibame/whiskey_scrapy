4.5,"Cask-strength whiskey at this price point? What's not to like? But be forewarned, this is young and meant to be to showcase the grain as opposed to mellowing it out with oak. Butterscotch highlights the nose with a little mineral note. More butterscotch on the tongue with spice and candied fruit. Warm finish as expected but not as hot as you'd think at 118 proof. Add a few drops of water and let it sit for 10-15 minutes to air out. Very enjoyable! I prefer to drink this neat. I love the bold flavors and don't want to diminish them by mixing. Though I have to admit it works great with a Manhattan!"
