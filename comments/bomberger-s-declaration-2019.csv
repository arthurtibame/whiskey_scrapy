3.0,Tobacco. Watkins Vanilla. Big Red Gum. Old leather and outside oak.
5.0,"This is probably my favorite bottle in my extensive collection.  

It smells like marshmallows and creme brulee. A touch of vanilla and Maple syrup. Even with my nose entirely in the glass, there's almost no burn. 

Flavor wise, there's almost a French oak wine smoothness to this, although the flavor is burnt sugar and creamy vanilla pudding.

The best part about this is the way it just coats your mouth and lingers. There's no part about this finish that disappoints.

Every time I come back to this, I regret having not bought more bottles."

3.25,Rich vanilla/caramel nose at first with ice cube not typical of US*1 products (no marshmallow). After some time hints of marshmallow do start coming up however. Sweet finish but not very long and falls a bit flat. Nothing jumping out on the tongue. Will revisit (this is a neck pour)
4.25,"Quite oaky and sweet, medium to long finsh, good stuff."
4.0,"Very smooth and somewhat sweet. Not a super long finish, but I really enjoyed sipping this neat. I admit that I’m a fan of much of what Michter’s does, so I was glad to find a bottle of this. Probably not worth the $100 price, but still a good Dram."
2.5,Nose is a light cherry vanilla. Easy drinker finishes with a barrel note. The barrel is not off putting or overpowering.  Slight sweetness but not able to pinpoint source. Best summer up as sweet barrel.

F: Very short with some lingering oak and char

Could be just the night, but it's like eating the barrel."
