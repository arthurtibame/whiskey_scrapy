4.0,"No 6. on my Glenfiddich journey. $15 USD for the whole tasting range is a bargain! Port, sherry, spicy, toffee. I like this a lot. As pb mich says I think this is also my favourite ahead of the 15. Early 4's at least and at $90usd great drop. This was rated 2nd on the night out of 8 Glenfiddichs by ~ 20 people. I managed to sneak a 2nd taste in...literally the last dram. Update 6/03/18 My previous review was for Batch #1. Ok I've now had Batch 1 and Batch 2. I was at dramfest with a mate who had a bottle of batch #1 and said like me it was very good. We both tried Batch #2.....I think I almost saw him cry. It's gone way down hill. Night and day between the two batches."

4.0,"Project XX starts off a bit briny. You'll find a woodier profile with subtle sweetness. Water drops opens up more earthy tones followed by pecans and what I detected as papaya. 

It's incredibly smooth, almost soothing as it hits the palate and leaves. That might have something to do with the mild honey you can find hidden upon swallowing. The linger is short lived, not vanishing, but doesn't make a home either.

This is straight up enjoyable without a lot of bells and whistles and that stability is a wonderful thing.

5.0,"My favorite Glenfiddich so far.  Apparently, Glenfiddich took 20 casks and married them together.  17 were from bourbon barrels, 2 from sherry, and 1 from port.  Balvenie did something like this, under then Tun 1409 series, but priced it about 10x as much as this one.  So...unfortunately, I only had a sample of this, along with a sample of their IPA casks.  I felt the IPA cask was just too strong with a beer taste, while this was really well engineered.  When I went to look for a full bottle to buy, it was sold out.  Plenty of the IPA ones available...go figure.  The nose is the best part in this---summer in a bottle.  Light, fresh, airy, with plenty of orchard fruits.  Mouth is rich and viscous, with light spices like cinnamon, but heavy on vanilla and honey.  More of that summer in a bottle.  If you do happen to see one...grab it.  Really well made, and quite reasonably priced.  My sample was a mere $4, and the bottle itself was $48."

3.0,"Another day, another Glenfiddich. I had high hopes for this, because let's be honest here, the name ""Project XX"" sounds awesome. Unfortunatly, this is my least favorite of the bunch so far. It's not bad, but also not very good, at least not in my opinion. On the nose I get very faint honey, some sharp pepper and zesty citrus notes. This is a pretty accurate representation of what you can expect on the taste. Malty honey, a load of vanilla (this is the primary note for me, and I'm not a big vanilla fan in scotch. When I want vanilla, I drink bourbon), the tart citrus notes with pepper over it. Reminds me of a creme brulee. Certainly not bad, but could use some more spices and fruityness. The vanilla taste is staying quite a while, without being overly sweet. Maybe I'm a bit harsh on this because I had higher expectations, but the 18 blows this out of the water, and even the IPA is more my thing, even though it's more bitter than I usually like. At least it's complex, not something I can say about this vanilla bomb. And for only about 15 bucks difference in price, I'd grab the 18 any day. Cheers."

3.0,"I wanted to take a moment to give this one a quick review.  I’ve had this bottle for well over a year now and I was shuffling through unopened bottles a few weeks ago, looking for something that might mix well with Coca Cola.  I had finished off the last of my cheap, bourbon mixers and wasn’t about to open an Elijah Craig 18 to make a B&C.  Needless to say, this one played well with ice and cola.

I ended up trying this neat on several occasions but forgot to write any notes down.  I seem to recall the nose being very sweet:  vanilla and sherry sweetness, with some slight port wine influence.  The palate seemed to be dominated by the oak casks used while still being somewhat sweet and hot.  The finish was oaky and medium in length, with some sweetness hanging around for quite awhile afterwards.

It played well with the cola and worked well on its own.  I don’t think I’d replace it, but I’d recommend it over the younger, standard Glenfiddich stuff I’ve had in the past.  3.5 stars.  Cheers."

4.0,"I purchased this bottle at the distillery in Dufftown prior to its availability in the US. This is my second or third pour from the bottle since the purchase in May 2017, which by no means is any reflection of my take on the dram. 

The whisky has a wonderfully classic nose of caramel and oak. It leaves an expectation of sweetness. The first taste is much hotter than I anticipated but is calmed upon a second take. The overall sweetness is certainly present with a warm vanilla and hint of fruit - perhaps figs and pear. Certainly a well constructed whisky with definite hints of its time spent in multiple barrels."

4.0,"Nose - Dark apple juice, light cinnamon, candied ginger, raisins, prunes, honey.

Taste - White pepper/ginger spice/heat/tingle, honey, raisins, golden raisins, faint clove, cinnamon, light metallic, baked apples.

Finish - Lingering lightly oaky white pepper/ginger heat, lingering honey, golden raisin sweet, apple skin/core bitter.

Score - 86/100

Final Thoughts - This is an interesting Glenfiddich with an interesting concept of marrying 20 completely random casks together. On paper, it looks as if you'd just get a giant hot mess, but this somehow works in its own way. There's a nice balance of sweet port/sherry balanced with ex-bourbon to give this nice vanilla/fruit balance. I've only tried this neat, but I could see this at a slightly higher proof and NCF doing well in a cocktail that hightlights the spicy ginger aspects of this. Maybe something as simple as a highball.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - Maybe, I need to try more of the bottle to see if it's really worth it"

3.0,"This review is based on Batch 2. If you handed this to me blindfolded, I’d have thought it was an Irish blended whiskey heavy on the pot still and malt content. Big, upfront tree fruit, vanilla, baking spice, and something slightly bitter and vegetal. There’s a certain jaggedness to the finish, suggesting to me that perhaps some of the spirit here could have used a bit more time in the barrel. It left me wondering what this could be if given more time to develop. Enjoyable, and certainly more interesting than the standard GF 12, but incomplete. Thanks for sharing, @PBMichiganWolverine!"

Taste : It is quite surprising how the nose and the taste can be different. The notes of vanilla completely disappear, to make place to a strong oak taste. Apples are still present.

Finish : Smooth, lengthy, oaky with notes of almonds.

Good scotch, but I am off put by the difference between nose and taste. I really like the nose, but the taste is a little bland compared to the nose."

Nose: apple-cinnamon; pear dominate. Nothing special.

Taste: sweet, fruity and medium-bodied, then develops a nice dry but not overpowering spiciness (pepper and chile) followed by caramel, raisin, vanilla, dark cocoa and a pinch of salt and citrus. Very nice ride!

Finish: medium-long, with a tangy sweet stone fruit and nuttiness along with caramel/vanilla/honey and a lingering black licorice note.

Value: Not exclusive yet $60 to 80 USD. Borderline too pricy.

Final thoughts: An interesting Glenfiddich for sure, as it greats you rather predictable nose but then takes you on a ride. The influence of port wine pipes are evident here, and really give this a uniqueness among Fiddich's. While a tad pricey for an NAS this one is certainly worth it and offers a few surprises with your Speyside.

Score: 4/5 (Recommend buying a bottle)

4.0,"Installment #2 of Glenfiddich's Experimental Line. I found the Fire & Cane to be decent, but I wasn't sure what to expect from this when I bought it. At any rate, I like the packaging.

Nose: Fruit bomb. Plum and raisin. Apple, pear, orange, apricot. Cereals, malt, toffee, honey, vanilla. Oak and caramel. Very floral. A bit of cola. While it may not deviate from the standard Speyside profile, it is one of the more vibrant than many of its regional counterparts.

Palate: Big pear and apricot. Still a bit of plum, now with dark grape. Really nice caramelized apple note. Toffee, honey, vanilla, shortbread cookie, and marshmallow. Orange zest and milk chocolate.

Finish: With an unusually high ABV for a Glenfiddich (47%), this offers a medium finish. It's fruity and floral, into cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and oak spice. It's the first time the extra 4-7% ABV becomes palpable.

Dangerously drinkable, typical Speyside, nothing truly noteworthy. Those are the first things that come to mind. It's very good Scotch. It takes the average Speyside profile and amplifies it just a bit at every turn.

I really like the product, whether or not the marketing is accurate. It's going to have to be a bit more eventful to break the 4-star plane at $68, but I'd be lying if I said this wasn't real nice stuff.

It's edition #2, and they're up to edition #4, so availability is limited. If you're looking for a quintessential background whisky with enough character to surprise you on occasion, this is worth a grab. 4 stars and my second favorite from Glenfiddich at the moment, after the 14 year. Regardless, this is very well put to together."

4.25,"I have finally tasted the 3 experimental series bottles of Glenfiddich. This ""experiment No. 2"" is a whisky made allegedly by 20 brand ambassadors, each one allegedly picked one cask of the distillery and they have blend them all. 

Bottled at 47%abv

Well, this is a very interesting dram. My nosing notes are: foam (carnival foam, the one kids throw on each other, comes in cans), brown sugar, apples, prunes, impalpable sugar. So many nose profiles due to the mixture of may casks. A very artificial aroma. 

On the palate is not that great, without been a bad dram. A little strong maybe, due to its 47%abv. Oak presence is strong, liquorice, pepper, mango, caramel. Cloying sensation in the mouth because of its sweetness. 

The finish is medium with tobacco notes. Overall i give this interesting and exotic dram a fair 87 over 100. I can now tell you that out of the 3 experiments, winter storm (No.3) is the best by far and you could just buy the 3 bottles to have the collection, but only the 3rd one is really worth your time. Not bad drams at all, but their marketing is better than the actual drams."
