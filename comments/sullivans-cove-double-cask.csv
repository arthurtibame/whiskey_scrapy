3.0,"It's a clean, easy drinking whisky...but really very much unidimensional.  Not much going on in there, no complexity or layers of flavors.  Try the French oak, by far much better."

null,"Nose- vanilla, sweet, can smell the bourbon and port influences. 
Tasting- smooth, surprisingly long warm finish, slight spiced vanilla, bourbon caramels, rum n raisin chocolate, easy drinking great dram would definitely buy this bottle!"
5.0,What a wonderful whisky! It really hits all the points I like with no peat. Unbelievably long finish but so bright on the nose with floral scents and spices. So this really just malted barley or did they sneak in some rye and corn for spice and sweetness?

4.0,Had this at the distillery (21/4/18) and was described as a breakfast whisky. The nose has vanilla and honey and translates into the palate as well but no sign of cereals

4.0,"Bought this at the distillery after the tour & tasting. At $50 including tastings, if you're in Tassie this is a must do!. It was described to me as their ""Breakfast Whisky"". Lighter than its big brother the French Oak but flavour is still there. It's also a lot cheaper!"

3.0,Good whisky. Loses structure quickly with water and air.

3.75,This has a sweetness to it that makes me wonder if it's had something added post- distillation
