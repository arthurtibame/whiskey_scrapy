3.25,"Distillery only release.  I never thought Balcones would win me over, and they almost did but not quite.  Definitely unique.  Tastes like nothing else in my collection. BUT, there's still something strange and singular about all things Balcones.  All of their bottles have this one signature indescribable (to me) flavor.  It's not desirable IMO. However, the chocolate on the finish is outstanding."
3.5,"On the nose, the spicy notes of the rye present first, almost smelling like wet tree bark, with the intensely sweet caramel and vanilla notes hovering underneath. The taste is very similar with the high ABV grabbing attention first, followed by the spicy rye and caramel notes but in equal proportion rather than rye dominance with the flavors playfully trading superiority as you return to the glass."
