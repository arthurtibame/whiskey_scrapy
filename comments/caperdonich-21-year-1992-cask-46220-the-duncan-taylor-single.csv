3.25,"Ah memories of the old days. Years ago when many on this site,  @PBMichiganWolverine @Generously_Paul @LeeEvolved and others were making their way around Scotland tasting all the available distilleries. I tagged along remotely having ordered samples from every distillery. Now with my sample pile dwindling to ~ 20 i pulled out three remnants of that journey. And this was one. Very much a box ticking exercise and that is what it tasted like. Plain old simple refill fare."
