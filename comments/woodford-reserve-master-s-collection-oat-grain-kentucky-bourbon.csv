4.0,"Quite sweet, almost like eating gingerbread. Lots of caramel and almost a hint of nutmeg or cinnamon, can’t quite put my finger on it. Worth a buy."

3.75,"Much softer feel with the oats, very different than typical bourbons. Much sweeter and easily sippable."
3.5,Balanced over all. Not heavy on spice or sweet. Oat flavor predominate flavor obviously.
3.5,"Nose: cinnamon, vanilla and oak

Taste: very smooth. Buttery texture on the tongue. Notes of caramel on the backend with some spice."

2.5,Unique. Smells like bread. Tastes malty. Spicy. Feels hotter than the proof suggests. 2/1/19

3.25,"Nose: Dusty oats, cherry, wood, old books. 

Taste: Sweet cherry, bitter nutmeg, cereal, stale brown sugar.

Experience: this is walking into a feed store or mill with a cherry pie in the window. Dusty but sweet. 

Not something I'd be reaching for regularly but a fun look into what other grains we might be overlooking."

4.0,"Another great entry from woodford, almost showing noted from cask finished whiskies.

Nose: Sweet Honey, carmalized marmalade and ginger.

Taste: Sweet upfront of cola funk that rolls into burnt toast and roasted peanuts.

Overall a solid medium bodied whiskey that dries quickly leaving your mouth ready for another. Very intriguing style of whiskey.

Keep drinking friends... Skol!"

4.0,Classic woodford flavor with a distinct oatmeal cookie finish. Cool flavor that is a nice change of pace from your ordinary bourbons.
3.25,"90.4 proof.  One of the 2 Master’s Collection releases this Autumn from Woodford Reserve.  This is the Oat Grain Bourbon 66% Corn, 18% Oat, 4% Rye, and 12% Malt.  This is one of the bottles I bought while hanging out in Southwest Florida this week, and I decided to throw out a review as this thunderstorm rolls through.

N:  Maple, brown sugar, vanilla, applesauce, fresh oak, lemongrass, cinnamon, and yes - some oatmeal.

P:  Creamy chocolate initially, pears, apple, vanilla, lightly astringent.

F:  Cocoa, lightly astringent, tannic, lemon, toasted oak.

This caught me off guard.  It has some elements of a fruity Speyside Scotch or Irish whisky.  I’m really not a fan of this, but it is fairly unique.  It does seems to be a well-balanced concoction as well.  No aspect is overpowering.  I can see some people really enjoying this and others not so much. I’m in the “not so much” group, but it’s doable.  I wouldn’t purchase another bottle to drink for sure.  Cheers!"

2.75,"Much more boozy than I expected.  Nose far more interesting than the flavor.  Nose a sweet brown sugar, leather and wood.  It’s got legs!  Really coats the glass in a thick, syrupy coating.  Flavor is very harsh, burn - and definitely tastes farmlike: Hay, oats, saddle!  Overall, ok and something different in the collection but not sure how often I will go for it."
3.0,I dont get the oatmeal cookie that other people say this oat grain is supposed to have.  Very woody flavor.  I am indifferent to it but not special considering the $110 price for it.  Will evaluate again once it has time to air out.

3.5,"Tasted at a friend's a few nights ago (along with several others).

Nose - started with chewing tobacco, seasoned wood (but different from the typical bourbon oak note), leather, and baking spices. With some breathing time the tobacco faded and the wood/spices became more prominent. Really unique nose, hard to describe but I liked it.

Palate - Followed expectations from the nose, except drier than I expected, without the sweetness that most Woodford expressions tend to have. Some sweetness did show up  just before the finish, just not as much as I expected. Mouthfeel was a bit thin. Medium finish was dry but without a lot of bitter tannins.

I didn't get the 'oatmeal cookie' flavors that Woodford talks about in their marketing materials, which was a little disappointing because that sounds really good. Overall I liked this a fair bit, it was really unique. A bit drier on the palate than I might prefer, but still enjoyable; and the unique flavor profile was a nice change of pace. At $110-130 I think it's substantially over-priced, unfortunately. I'd probably pay $75-ish for it just due to the uniqueness."

3.5,Soft on the palate. No real burn.  Enjoyed this neat and I usually drink whiskey with a large cube. Nice change of pace to typical bourbon mashbills
5.0,Grassy and oat forward on the nose with a smell of leather.  Very smooth easy drinking bourbon. Spicy notes but not overpowering with a generally sweet taste. Very enjoyable if the price was a bit lower. It's not going to taste like a typical bourbon but I think that's the point with this one.
0.25,"No one flavor stood out!  It was a hodgepodge of flavors with none of them being good!  This has to be one of the worst Bourbons I have tried, and when the cost this is added in title would be the worst."
3.5,Soft oat aroma. Soft oats with characteristics reminiscent of Irish whiskey.

4.25,"Well, they did what they set out to do. Russett apples on the nose and in the split second of the fore palate. Quickly changes to oats, oats and more oats. A long finish with more layers of oats."

4.75,"On the nose: flat cola and hints of citrus (in addition to the always present caramel and vanilla). On the tongue: one of the smoothest starts, tastes of cola and caramel, and so smooth it leaves through the back room without bothering anyone else. I can see why so many reviews say this is so easy to drink neat; I agree. When I added a little water I noticed the oat. As others noted, this is a pricey bourbon. I'd buy it for the novelty and drinkability, but not for the drinkability alone. Without regard for the retail price, this is a really nice bourbon. Good job, Woodford team!"

3.25,"Nose: Deep rich sweetness, molasses, caramelized sugar, black pepper, gingerbread, warm oak. There's a great little dusty note that instantly takes you to a rickhouse on a hot Kentucky summer day...a good sign of expectations to come.

Palate: First notes are maple syrup, vanilla, sugar cookies, cinnamon rolls. Progressively moving into spicier territory, peppercorns, baking spices, hints of wintergreen. The finish is shorter than I'd like, but the minty tingle remains. All in it's very smooth and almost gentle....this is where I feel the Oat comes in.

Thoughts: This is a great bourbon, it drinks easily and I would be happy to have this as an everyday drinker. Great nose, great palate, mild finish. Unfortunately, it's the price that holds it back a little. Woodford's own Double Oaked Bourbon comes in at nearly half the price and has all the similar notes, albeit with some extra spice from the inclusion of the additional Rye that has been replaced with Oat here. Personally, a nice to have collector's bottle."
