5.0,5 Balance of flavor is done very well. Starts with sweet corn that fades fast into a long vanilla that finishes buttery. Definitely a rock pour. A true classic gem. Mmmmm
4.75,By far one of my favorites. Incredibly smooth with a fantastic flavor.

4.0,"In the same vein as Buffalo Trace and Eagle Rare, Taylor clearly tops them both. The mouth feel is the first thing that jumps out at me, far more rich and oily. Coats the glass and your throat. Taylor has a, long lingering finish with tons of spice on the back end.  I couldn't identify any specific favors here, but it's a good solid bourbon.
Unfortunately it's ridiculously over-priced and difficult to find like much of what comes from the Buffalo Trace Distillery.   I'd say it's a bit high at the official price of $40, and I certainly wouldn't spend the $65+ many places are trying to charge for it."
4.0,Nice full flavored bourbon!

4.0,"Nose is vanilla and a bit of cherry? Palate is very full of flavor, finish is a bit short but taste is very good. Tasting at a friends place, but a good pour that I’d buy if in stock"

4.5,"I am trying the Rye, not small batch (wasn't in the app database).  Tasting alone on the rocks.  Very smooth, limited bite if at all.  Quite tasty with a nice aftertaste.  Would highly recommend."
