4.5,"N: Toffee Apples, hint of peat but not overwhelming. Some vanilla 

P: Toffee sweetness, very smooth mouth feel, strong vanilla with salt and spice at the back end. 

F: Smokey but very light, salty, medium finish.

Absolutely wonderful dram. Happily have a bottle of this on my shelf."

4.0,Just a bit short of perfection. It's age balances out the smokiness and provides a citrusly/lemony taste mixed with the salty brine of the sea. I usually prefer the smokiness of the 10 but is perfect when my taste buds are yearning for something more comfortable.

4.0,"Good whisky, good conversation with business associate with Cohiba's and this 18 year old. A light, sweet nose with a touch of peat and floral.  Lacks the signature peat of Laphroaig.  That sweetness carries onto the palate with a hint of oak and drying tannins.  Very little smoke. Extremely well balanced and enjoyable. The maturity has tamed the younger version making this a easy sipping Laphroig. [90/100][Whisky on the Hudson 9/18/14; Houston 7/14/16]"

Take a sip, and be astonished by the thick and salty campfire, BBQ spices, and unmentionable dark things. It might as well be medicinal, that's how it finishes, and it lasts about 8 hours – when you need your next dose. Water kinda ruins it, if you consider ""putting out the smoke and fire"" to be a bad thing."

4.0,"The peat and smoke are there, but it's muted compared to the 10 year old or Quarter Cask.  But that's not necessarily a bad thing!  There's still a lot of flavor here: salty-seaweedy peat and mild smoke, oak sawdust, faint citrus and dried fruit (think raisins), sweeter than you might expect.  Good stuff!

The Distiller score rates the 10 year old higher, but as much as I enjoy a big, peaty slap in the face, I respectfully disagree with the Distiller's 96 for the 10 year old vs the 90 for the 18.  The 18 has more depth and is richer than its younger sibling.  jm2c :)"

5.0,"Enjoyed at World Cafe Live, Philadelphia (to see The Ocean Blue perform their first two albums, INCREDIBLE night). Nose greets you with sweet, gently enveloping smoke, then subdued peat, like damp earthy moss and autumn leaves. Orchard fruits, dates, orange rind, seaweed and definitive Laphroaig ""band-aid"" medicinal notes. Hints of oaky vanilla, marshmallow and chocolate. A little Water seems to bring out a touch of rich pipe tobacco. On the palate it's intense, mouth-filling, slightly beer-y with winter spices. Smooth and warming. Finish is dry and achingly long. I'll let you know when it's over. Don't wait up. An unforgettable experience, will have to grab a fifth soon... Dry glass: bold roast coffee with sweet cream..."

Don't go here expecting anything like the 10.  This is more complex, more elegant, and more multidimensional.  It has the same sea swept rope aroma of the 10, but muted with added layers of caramel and toffee.  The taste is more floral than the 10, with peat in the background always lurking and letting you know that it still has the Laphroaig DNA.  Finish is long.  With a lasting lemon-chocolate-mocha taste that lingers and lingers.  I think this is now replaced by the Lore if I'm not mistaken...hopefully the Lore is able to carry the same weight."

4.0,"I think I've come to the realization that I prefer my sherried whiskys well aged (entire time in first fill casks) and my peated Islays not so much. I love the peated intensity of the 10, An Cuan and others. The 18 whilst a very good whisky just doesn't grab me as this aspect is mostly absent....the extended age having allowed the cask to suck most of the peat out. I think to be honest part of the fact I'm rating this a 4 rather than a 3 is my love of Laphroaig and the fact I paid less than $100 USD for the bottles I bought. Having said all that I did enjoy drinking my way through the bottle in a session with friends though and most rated it as their favorite whisky on the night of the several we tried"
5.0,My favourite scotch whisky to date I am so disappointed that the suntory/beam group have decided to discontinue the 18.  This is such a lovely balanced drink when I first tasted the 18 I nearly went through half the bottle while smoking a nub maduro cigar. The drink that made me fall in love with laphroaig. Lucky I bought 4 bottles but wish I bought more

5.0,"I had the privilege of trying a sample of this discontinued whiskey thanks to Davie Warner.  I took my time to appreciate this, and actually nosed the bottle at random times for a few days before pouring out a dram.  The peat has mellowed out a lot in the additional 8 years of aging, so do not expect the standard Laphroaig full-frontal assault.  It's less bonfire, more Encyclopedia Britannica -- think a shelf of aged, leather-bound tomes.  There's also a healthy dose of brine and seaspray.  Underneath these classic Laphroaig signatures is a much sweeter and more succulent layer of cured, salted ham, neroli, and tangerine or orange.  The fruit flavors creep forward over time and eventually outshine the peat, which fades into the background.  The palate almost trembles with flavor on entry, and it's quite intensely fruity.  After a flood of tangerines and mandarin oranges (I almost imagine a cocktail mixing Cointreau and Laphroaig in equal measures), there are also some hints of tropical fruit and toffee.  The peat provides nice balance here, in combination with some oak backbone, but it's a subtle, toasted flavor, rather than a smoke.  It's also, as Gordon Ramsay would say, perfectly seasoned (meaning a healthy pinch of salt).  It finishes like an Aztec chocolate bar -- dark chocolate, chili pepper flecks, some orange peel, and salt on the lips.  There is almost something sherried about it, a berry-like sweetness at the end.  The finish stretches forever, and has a mouth-drying sensation similar to Highland Park 18, with some pepperiness as well.  A superb scotch, for occasions when a more restrained peat is appropriate.  The best comparison I can draw is that it's somewhere halfway between Highland Park 18 and Laphroaig 10."

5.0,"Laphroaig needs to bring this one back.  If Bowmore, which has distilled nothing good since the 80s, can keep an 18 year around, Laphroaig can stop dicking around with NAS “specials” that lose to Ardbeg.  The old bottling of the 18 is dark green; the Laphroaig Lore mimics that particular style, which is sweet and fruity balanced with peat.  This is a review of the newer bottle with the familiar white label, which is much better, and is liquid leather.

NOSE: Don’t start sipping on this right away.  The nose is sawdust and soft smoke at first.  8 extra years in bourbon casks have made this Laphroaig shy.  It starts waking up, and reaches a contemplative point where it smells like a mix between the leather interior of a new luxury car and wet socks.  Makes you ponder, “Do they make leather socks?”  And then it becomes full blown luxurious leather.  Like newly polished wholecut Oxford shoes.  Artisan deli meats are in the background.  This sophistication is dominant over the 10 year old bandages, which are still there if you search.  Once you start smelling shoe polish and leather shoes, that’s when you taste.

PALATE: Instead of bandaids and iodine of younger Laphroaig, you get a more shamanistic medicine.  Red clay, herbal teas, and other forms of voodoo.  Reminds me of a couple of Chinese recipes: eggs hard boiled in black tea, and soup made from pork bones, seaweed, and kelp.  It’s delicious.  Medicinal, leathery, umami, and chocolatey as it evolves and evolves in your mouth.  Background of bitter lemon rind and mint keeps the taste somewhat fresh.

FINISH: The leathery smokiness and herbal tea flavors stay.  There’s smoke and mint, like menthol cigarettes.  There’s a lasting, lingering savoriness like after a good bowl of ramen broth flavored with smoked pork and seaweed.

WITH WATER: I find this one even better with a teaspoon of water.  It becomes sweater and more savory.  It goes from medicinal tea to sweet oysters from the Northern Puget Sound.  Leather is still prominent, with some southern barbeque and bison jerky.  The finish is less smoky and more minty.

VERDICT: This really takes time to develop.  A freshly opened bottle only achieved about an 89 on my scale, but this becomes almost flawless after about 1-2 months of being opened.  It hits the flavors I treasure the most: leather, savory umaminess, herbal teas, dark rich chocolate, and oysters.  Price is $100-120.  If you can still find a bottle for around that price, this is well worth it.  MARK: 94/100."

5.0,"Nose: Smoke, oak and a host of warm sawdust aromas combine seamlessly to create an elegantly sophisticated nose that is more than the sum of its parts. Suggestions of vanilla, honey, brine, iodine, seaweed, black tea, grapefruit, leather, moist earth (dunnage earth) and ground spices. The distinctive Laphroaig ""hospital antiseptic"" aroma has muted with age to create a smoky creosote background. In combination it's like a display of polished amber presented on black velvet.  With time in the glass the nose gains even greater depth and coherence. Give it at least 15 minutes before tasting and keep nosing all the time.

Palate: After the delicacy of the nose, the palate comes as a slight surprise - this whisky is by no means aged and infirm. The arrival is well defined, smoky, slightly dry and a little spicy. In the development it becomes spicy, nutty and creamy. The palate is full of sweet smoke with nuances of tar, bitter lemon, vanilla, avocado and honey - similar to the nose but in a more authoritative form.  The spice that appears in the development stays through into the finish. It is warming and soothing on the throat.

Finish: Long and lingering, spicy, a good saltiness and just the faintest hint of the trademark Laphroaig licorice.  The licorice remains, and is the final flavour, along with a slight bittersweet tang of 90% dark chocolate, a touch of mint, and quite a bit of smoke. A really satisfying finish and aftertaste

This whisky has a very nice texture that is both mouth-coating and dry, and 48% abv is perfect to carry it.  The critical factor with enjoying it is time - you need to dedicate at least an hour to the dram. Patience. Any comments that this whisky is lacking in peat smoke are, IMHO, based on  hurried tastings.

It is delicious neat and the only reason to add water is to enjoy a slightly different profile, but please don't drown it, I beg you - just a couple of drops. This enhances both the nose and palate without changing them substantially - everything gains a little fullness, the spice and sweet notes seem to weld together and the smoke is ... well, ""blown around in the glass"" is the only way I can put it. Not amplified exactly, but uplifited as if by a breeze.

This is a fabulous whisky that is sadly just about unavailable (I happened to obtain a bottle by chance recently, and I don't know if there is any left in the country now). I certainly hope that in a few years, if their stocks have built up, Beam Suntory will issue another Laphroaig 18 as good as this.

5.0,"Subtle barbecue, TCP/Iodine, vanilla, deep floral notes, sugar and leather appear on the nose. The palate brings on a very refined peaty smoke, ginger, custard, cream, vanilla, and butter. It's a thinner mouthfeel that expected, but it is well aged. The long finish is a nice creosote, tar, rubbery ball of goodness. A reverse campfire with light fruit. Brings to mind ""What's the Frequency, Kenneth"" by R.E.M. because of the guitar solo. Anyway, you need to take your time with this as @cascode and @ScotchingHard stated (thanks for the tips guys). This is a definite 4.75. So close to the 5, if it was a little oilier, but I am far from bitchin'."

Nose: rich and complex, with a potent but far from overpowering peat smoke of road tar, medicinal and martine notes. Other notes include floral; dark chocolate fudge; lime; vanilla; brine; damp oak wood; sweet dark fruits like plum and raisin. Also a hint of herbs like parsley along with baked goods...gingerbread, perhaps? So much happening here.

Taste: full, sweet, savory and oily. Medium bodied. The peat smoke spice hits you first but quickly makes room for an explosion of other subtle notes. I seem to pick up something new each time.l, especially after leaving sit in the glass with a few drop of water in it. In no particular order: chili pepper; lime citrus; vanilla; cinnamon sugar; caramel; floral; fudge; toffee; sea salt; umami from a hint of seaweed and fish sauce; teriyaki bbq; nuttiness like hazelnut or almond; bitter herb.

Finish: medium and buttery. A slight ashy peat lingers along with sweets like vanilla, red apple and raw honey, also dark chocolate espresso, almond, lime juice/salt like from the rim of a margarita glass, menthol, and a slight tartness which reminds me of pomegranate.

Value: this is discontinued, so if you see it on a shelf it may be as little as $100 (buy immediately) otherwise prepare to spend hundreds on the secondary market.

Final thoughts: What a whisky. This was a dynamite expression from Laphroaig, pure and simple. It’s complexity simply mesmerizes, and has a balance so integrated it makes this 48% malt drink like its a 40%. The signature peat smoke is there, but it’s part of the orchestra with this Laphroaig. The finish is a littler shorter than I’d want, but it’s such a minor ding that it was almost not worth even mentioning. It’s a damn shame this work of art is not still available, but I’ll say this: you only live once, so if you see this for even $200, pull the trigger.

Score: 4.5/5

Highly recommend buying a bottle.

(I’ve got a few green tube versions as well which I’ll compare to this in the near future.)"

4.5,"Nez très légèrement tourbé, ce qui est étonnant pour un Laphroaig. C’est salin et un peu sur la poire aussi, peut-être même un peu de gâteau au beurre salé.
En bouche, ça attaque franchement sur de la tourbe mais bien maîtrisée et fruitée, rien ne dépasse et tout s’enrobe bien, sur des arômes légers, très sympa mais difficiles à décrire, enrobés dans un sirop bien sucré.
En finale, on retrouve cette même rondeur qui se révèle lentement derrière la tourbe, nous emmenant en voyage loin d’Islay.
Très agréable whisky même s’il n’arrive pas jusqu’à mon top 5..."

Une attaque qui décape puis une énorme présence en bouche, mais étonnemment pas trop fumée. Un peu tourbé mais surtout très aromatique en bouche.

Un excellent whisky qui se dévoile au fur et à mesure..."

5.0,"Bottle-kill review.

It is with both sadness and enormous satisfaction that I pour the final dram from my last bottle of white-tube Laphroaig 18. This is a whisky of infinite subtle facets. It stands at the entrance to the rabbit-hole into the world of old Laphroaig expressions that constantly evolve in complexity with age through the 25, 27, 30 year and older bottlings. Young Laphroaig can be fantastic. Old Laphroaig is sublime.

Cut to the chase - this is a 5-star whisky. One of only 19 I've awarded that score on Distiller.

The nose displays gentle, soft, complex smoke and warm woody aromas that combine effortlessly to create an elegant presence that is more than the sum of its parts. There are suggestions of vanilla, honey, brine, iodine, seaweed, black tea, grapefruit, leather, moist earth and ground spices. The distinctive Laphroaig ""hospital antiseptic"" aroma is muted with age and here presents itself as a subtle sweet creosote background that contributes weight rather than aroma.

The palate is firm, full, honey-sweet and richly smoky. It has great definition and is huge in presentation, slightly dry and a little spicy. The ordinary world fades from perception as the reality of peated fulfillment awakens. The developed palate is redolent with sweet smoke that has nuances of tar, bitter lemon, vanilla, oil and honey - similar to the nose but in a more visceral form. The spice that appears in the development stays through into the finish and is warming and soothing on the throat. You lament it when it fades.

Finish: Long and lingering, spicy, the mildest of saltiness and just the faintest hint of the trademark Laphroaig licorice. This licorice note remains, and is the final flavour, along with a soupçon bittersweet tang of 90% dark chocolate and a touch of sweet mint.

This whisky has a perfect texture that is both mouth-coating and dry, and 48% abv is just right to carry it. The critical factor with enjoying this whisky is time - you need to dedicate at least an hour to the dram - anything less is sacrilege. Patience.

This magnificent whisky is now only available through auction or reseller sites. My bottles cost AUS$240 four years ago, but the one bottle I can find locally is now selling for AUS$450. It's still worth it.

""Outstanding"" : 5 stars"
