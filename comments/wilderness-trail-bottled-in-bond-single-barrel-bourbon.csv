4.5,"Neat.  A restaurant pour made such a good impression, I bought my own bottle for a proper tasting.

On the nose, the corn hits you strong.  It’s a candied corn, like a caramel corn.  Lot a more spice than the restaurant pour.  The nose is mostly mid-range note that ends on a high vanilla as you dig deep.

Nice smooth, full bodied texture.  A sweet treat.  Sugar overtakes the tongue, butterscotch transitions to a punch in the face of vanilla.  Really good dessert bourbon.  

Might be my favorite wheater outside of Weller and Makers.  Nice job Wilderness Trail, you won over a fan with this juice."
4.25,"Neat.  Very nice sweet treat.  Restaurant pour so nose is hard to review.  Texture is fantastic, nice and thick.  Super sweet on the tongue immediately, straight sugar.  Gives way to waves of vanilla and caramel."
3.75,Great nose and a classic bourbon flavor. A great sipping bourbon that does not disappoint. This is a really good pour.

4.25,"The appearance is very light, which I can assume is due to its short aging cycle. Color is very close to an apple juice or a light brewed tea. 

The initial nose brings fragrance of banana, maple, caramel, and toasted sugars. 

Up front I was amazed by the flavor, as it was a very smooth and light taste of caramel and licorice, with almost a hint of cinnamon and spice. 

As for the finish, it’s very peppery with almost a very long and creamy cherry vanilla finish."

1.5,"Taste:  2oz in Glen Cairn glass first neat, then with on ice chip.

Nose: (1.5) Medicinal, lacquer-like.  reminds me of nail polish remover which is not a good thing.  Some pepper and corn in the background.  Overall not a good nose at all.

Palate (1.25): That pepper is upfront and then a bit astringent.  There is a bitterness that I can't escape.  The taste is on par with its nose.

Finish (1.0):  Long finish, lots of pepperiness.  Not alot to write home about other than the taste which I greatly disliked lingered forever.

Overall:  Not a fan.  My tasting notes explain it all.  You couple that with a 59.99 pricetag and I have to tank the rating on this."

4.75,"Sweet corn sweet vanilla cinnamon spice with a touch of citrus. Goes down smooth with just the right amount of heat on the follow through. 
Would not believe this is 100 pf. Great taste."

4.0,"Nose: 4 | cherries, dried berries, caramel, grain, hint of cinnamon 
Palate: 4.25 | nice viscosity; very much follows the nose
Finish: 3.75 | good hug, but not a super long finish
Price: 4

Verdict: Bottle
Incredible first offering.  If I could name this barrel, it would be 'Grandma's Cookies' because it's the liquid version of a berry oatmeal cookie."

3.0,"Mild vanilla, with herbal notes and a little smokey barrel char on the nose. Thin mouth feel. Can definitely taste the barley... Just a hint of spice on the finish which makes sense given the lack of rye in the mash bill. The heat from alcohol content can be mistaken for a mash bill with rye in it pretty easily. Much greener, younger finish than I anticipated from the 5-6 year age statement. For a $50 bottle, I'd say this needs a few more years in the barrel to mellow a bit more."

4.25,"Nose: cherries, toffee, corn and oak

Palate: more cherries, spicy vanilla & hints of raisin

Finish: medium and balanced, more dark fruits

Best craft bourbon I’ve had from 2018

This resembles Makers Cask Strength, just a little less alcohol and not quite as complex. But very good."

4.25,"Nose: sweet wheat right up front.  Like sugary wheated cereal; slight cherry or other fruits present 

Palate: very tasty light citrus, sweet oak and molasses

Finish: medium yet light.  

A very balanced bourbon for four years and a new distillery. Quite a different experience than the standard wheaters such as Weller, Old Fitz and Makers. The sweet wheat notes mix well with citrus and a little spice. Mouthfeel isn’t as oily as, say a Weller Antique. Consistent every pour even many weeks apart. Really interested in how this bourbon ages in future releases."

4.75,"Novice bourbon drinker here. My current preferred bourbon to sip neat is EH Taylor small batch to give you an idea of my personal taste.

This is super smooth. After the first sip the astringent qualities dissipate and you’re left with a long sweet finish. Nice choice for someone who loves a sweeter bourbon. I enjoyed sipping this one neat."
