2.0,Good marketing. Terrible bourbon. I'd rather get the 3 bottles of Beam for the price of one of these.

3.0,"hmm, this one was way different from others that I have tried. I picked up a bottle of Temptress, not the standard Herman Marshall. The initial taste is rather clean and corn, the aftertaste is very heavily smoky and spiced. Good, but it takes a little getting used to."

2.0,A little too much corn upfront for my taste. Leathery finish. There are better Texas bourbons out there.

3.0,"Absent on the nose, but very noticeable spice. Leather and wood abound. Sweet only on the finish. Decent linger, legs are short."

3.0,overpowering alcohol taste makes it hard to drink neat.  It's better served on the rocks or in a mixed drink

3.5,"I’ve learned to really like this Bourbon. My first tastes were rough, but now after letting it sit a bit in a ice ball, the taste is smoother and more enjoyable. Goes well with chocolate."

4.0,Dry corn-like aroma. Slight apple. Caramelly. Long and sweet finish with nice heat.
2.0,"Smells of vanilla, but bitter on the roof of my mouth. Stingy on the lips. Warms the throat a bit and lingers awhile. Not a pleasant finish. Smoky and leathery, strong unpleasant taste. Sorry, not a fan."
