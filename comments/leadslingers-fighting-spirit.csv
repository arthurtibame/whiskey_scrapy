3.5,"Nose: Big Red chewing gum.   I swear I couldn’t tell the difference.  

Palate: Extremely smooth and sweet for a rye. Cinnamon and black tea are the dominate notes to me.  

Finish:  Once again, smooth.  Cinnamon and brown sugar (maybe?).  No big “KY Hug”.  


Fine whisky.  Would never have thought it was a rye in a blind test.  Smooth and sweet.  More of an after dinner drink to me.  Probably not a daily drinker, but it has a place on any bar."
