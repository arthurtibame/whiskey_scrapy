3.0,"Nose: Brite. Citrus Orange and Brown Sugar.
Palate: Cocoa and Toffee. Grassy Sweetness.
Finish: Soft Spice. Minimal Chew. Soft Tobacco and Marshmallow

Overall it's young, but very decent"
3.75,Lots of corn. Butter.
0.25,Heavy grain and yeast on the nose. Steels like distillers beer. Taste mimics the nose. Very disappointed in how bad this bourbon is.

3.0,"Very young green woody, grassy, earthy nose. Faint sweetness in the nose, not quite vanilla... Maybe like a marshmallow. Light on the palate, very thin. Light barrel char flavor, bit of an herby flavor with a typical peppery rye lingering on the finish. Comparable to Journeyman Featherbone, but better."

1.5,Very young. Predominantly corn. Light vanilla. Short finish. Probably need to be aged a couple more years.

null,Worst whiskey ever tasted. Literally made me sick to my stomach. It was like drinking corn oil.

5.0,"Delicious! This is a newer distillery I have been following and their juice continues to get better and better with age. They raise all their own grain and distill it on their family farm outside of Chicago. Fairly complex for youth, caramel, definite corn, spice and a bit of dried orange peel. Nice nose and finish. Impressed."
