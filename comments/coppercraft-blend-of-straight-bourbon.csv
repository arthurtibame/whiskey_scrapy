3.5,"Pleasantly surprised. A touch of Oak, vanilla bean, and a hint of caramel smoke. Very easy drink. Nice to mix with, but wouldn’t have neat. A few years might help, but cannot complain for a bourbon at Comerica Park."
3.25,"A bit young, sweeter rather than spicy which I like. Not too complex."

2.0,"Smells like corn and wet newspaper. Oily on the palate, with distinct rye up front and and light oaky finish. My guess is they use a very light char barrel as I don't get any caramel, butterscotch, or vanilla that I associate with a more heavily charred barrel. I feel like a couple more years in the barrel might do this one some good... or maybe go really out there and rebarrel this into a heavy char barrel for a good 5-6 years and really get some complex flavors into it and call it a double oaked. As is, I suspect simple notes of baking spices will develop out of this one and the raw, young oakiness could develop into some citrus in future bottlings. Not a drain pour, but not kinda young and I don't get the impression it's going to turn into anything great with more time in the barrel."

3.0,"Missing some complexity up front, young tasting. Distillery sales person assured me it was a mix if 2 to 10 year old juice. Second tast resulted in traditional bourbon wood flavors. Sweeter rather than spicey. Easy to drink but would not buy again at this price. It has a preety bottle and was a good souvenir."
3.0,Has the taste of a younger Bourbon. No bad but missing the deep oak and character you get from others.   The corn and sweetness come through quite a bit.   Has a similar taste to other Michigan bourbons.  Maybe it’s the water?
