5.0,"The taste has been described as ""like Christmas"" and, for whatever it's worth, I fully agree. You won't find a better rye anywhere in the world, and you may not find this one. When was the last time you drank 129 proof whiskey that you didn't need to cut with water? Simply tremendous.
  
  NOSE: Floral / Baked Desserts / Spices
  
  TASTE: Spice / Cloves / Cinnamon
  
  FINISH: Amazing"

4.0,Strong rye flavors upfront (duh). As I roll it around in the mouth I get a bananas foster flashback. Not as sweet as 151 but packed with flavor and a tingle on the lips to finish.

5.0,Finally opened this bottle last night. By far far my favorite rye. The 129.2 proof was intimating but was very satisfying neat.  I wouldn't recommend water or ice as that takes away from the amazing spice and flavor.  If you find this drink available I highly encourage taking a sip.

5.0,"The first time, I tasted the THH, I was standing in a large convention centre, which was the venue for a whisky fair. I closed my eyes, as I tasted the THH,  and it felt like I got a very warm embrace from a very friendly woman, who had strong desire to to get to know me better. Ultimately,I had to open my eyes, and then I knew,  I had tasted the best Rye ever."

5.0,"Nose: Heaps of dried fruits – persimmon, apricots, figs, raisons, cranberries and prunes laced with caramelized spices – ginger nutmeg and cinnamon.  Some dried red apple slices, like you get at Trader Joes.  Old dried, dusty leather saddle from an even older barn.  Their is this interesting clay like, Destin baby ointment note that is noticeable, kind of medicinal.  Dried tomato dust, fresh cotton balls, calcium tablets and this leadiness, a distinct minerality comes on the back nose.  Some overripe banana pops out too.  Vanilla and new oak is definitly their too at the end which is interesting considering the old leathered qualites of this rye.  Some fruit leather rollup snacks from my childhood come out of the glass also.  Overall theirs a very chalky, musty texture to the nose.  Great nostalgic stuff and I’m not even into the palate.
______________________________________________________________________________________________

Palate: Dry.  Bone dry.  Then bursting yellow fruits cut through with some plush leather.  More dried apple turns to black crushed pepper.  Although their is weight to this whiskey, it posses a medium body.  At just six years old, this tastes much older.  Smokey rye notes make themselves heard.  Molasses and dark caramel with medium spices on the tongue.  From the nose, the dusty qualities follow through – this drinks like a dusty old book.  Menthol tannins play with now more older tasting oak.  Rye bread with dried dates and figs.  Just a beautiful balance of dried fruits and soft, dusty, leathery textures, I really can’t describe this whiskey any other way than that.  Just before the finish the menthol turns medicinal on the back.  Very rich mouthfeel.
______________________________________________________________________________________________

Finish: Very long.  The typical rye and black pepper spices linger w menthol and a little of the Desitin sticks around. Some sawdust/lumber qualities trail with an earthy blackberry concentration.  Complex for a finish.  Apricot jam, dates, scallops and a black cherry syrupy-ness. Theirs a slight plasticity that almost compliments the rye spices rounding out the finish as light smoke echoes and the dried fruits, having come full circle from nose to finish- they just trail and trail….you’ll be tasting this for up to 10 minutes after your last sip.

4.0,"Smells like sweet succulent rye. Not as stinging considering the proof. So sweet, very intense flavor, this is rye on steroids. Flowers, fennel, caramel, dark chocolate, even a bit of cream. Flavor takes a while to leave your mouth. Warm spice going down.  5/20/17"

4.0,"Seems different on the nose than other Handy bottles I've had. Strong alcohol sting, with an interesting watermelon/rubber note. On the palate, floral and fruity. Unmistakably a rye. Sweet, but a pleasant bitterness on the finish. Smoother than the nose and proof suggest. 8/2/18"

Now I know what all the hype is about - so sweet with just the right amount of spice & heat and a finish that just went on and on. Tried it with a couple drops of water as well but frankly all three of us preferred it neat."
