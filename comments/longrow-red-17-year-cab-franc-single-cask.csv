3.5,"The joys of drinking at a great whisky bar regularly is you get to try stuff you literally can't buy anywhere else. In this case a non-commercial present - a cask strength single bottle provided by Springbank distillery to the Last Word bar after Dramfest. I don't think I've seen or even heard of such an old Longrow Red before. Only one barrel exists. Peat, smoke, oak, slight bitterness, bourban influence. 3.5 I'll give it."
