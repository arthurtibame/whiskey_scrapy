2.0,"This distillery group has bottlings under many names. Inchmurrin, Inchmoan, Inchfad, Crotengea, Glen Douglass, Craiglodge and Loch Lomond. It's almost like the company that has bad PR and constantly changes their name. That isn't the case but given how much I detest their offerings I imagined it was. I thought musty but after drinking quality bourbans it's sour I'm getting this time. I never got used to sour beer and neither in whiskey. Some people like them, I don't. Some distilleries I love, most I'm ambivalent but only one Scotch single malt distillery I detest and this it is. 3 ratings below 3, 3 strikes and out."
