5.0,"Fruity sweet nose, reminding me of graham cracker pie crust.  The first mouthful removes any preconceived notions about Jameson.  Complex, smooth, well balanced, without the bitter bottom of the barrel flavors that standard Jameson leaves you with.  Sweetness is well controlled, and the finish is dry and lip smacking.  I prefer this one with a single whiskey ball, which enhances the smoothness.  My go to for unwinding after work, and I refuse to share."

If you want to test the 'fancy' whiskey waters, or are looking for a great value 'fancy' whiskey, check out Jameson 12. Inviting nose of fruit and sweets, nice vanilla, pear, and subtle spicy body with soft finish of toffy, wood, and vanilla. Be careful, it is easy to drink glass after glass."

Maybe a little citrus, something slightly dark. Goes in very smooth, sweet, possibly a hint of toffee or something dark like it. Long finish, passing through from darkly sweet to oak. Great taken neat."

4.0,null
5.0,"Oh My!  The nose is filled with grass, caramel and hints of stone fruit, begging to be tasted.  Palate opens warm, smooth and very creamy, coating the tongue.  Molasses and vanilla lead to light peat and smoke before shifting to stone fruit and nougat.  The finish is medium, slightly drying and then warm again, with smoke finishing over corn syrup.  This is so different from the standard Jameson as to be in another league.  Not as smooth as the Tyrconnel Single Malt, but much deeper, with richer flavors, less fruit, and more smoke.  This is a great everyday dram, and shouldn't be discounted by Scotch drinkers who think of Irish whisky as a coffee supplement.

 Tasted as a series, with Tyrconnell Single Malt, Jameson Black Barrel, Jameson 12yr, Redbreast 12yr and Green Spot. Ranking based on flavor from best to worst is Jameson 12yr, Tyrconnel, Redbreast 12yr, Jameson Black Barrel, and Green Spot. When value is factored in, the rank order is Jameson 12yr, Tyrconnel Single Malt, Jameson Black Barrel, Green Spot and Redbreast 12yr."""

Finishes long with a  little spice, brown sugar and oak. A mature and refined version of the standard.  This is one worthy of enjoying slowly and neat. [85/100].

The Black Barrel is a good step up from the NAS, and the 12 year takes it to a comparative level of other Irish Pot Stills in the same range.  The palate is strong on dark fruit and spice.  A little chocolate and a dash of vanilla appear for a greeting as well.  I found the texture to be light yet full all around, and the finish continues the spice ever so gracefully.  It may be a major brand, but quality is quality in my book!"

It's a little harsh on the palette, but is bursting with fruity flavours and nuts. Given the price point I think I'd spend a few extra bucks and head for a Rebreast!"

4.0,"Nose:
Sweet vanilla, toasted hazelnut, a quality preserve of berries ready to spread. That spicy Jameson signature sweetness is present throughout. The wife picked up a lot more sweet wood and richness, also saying she disagreed on the nuts but not the vanilla. Teasing in all the ways you want a robust Irish to.

Palate:
Cinnamon candies, glasses of good sherry glasses from the night before, sweet roasted lamb and a candela cigar. The wife seemed to say way more oily/earthy/sweet/medicinal overtones predominated for her with the floral opening matching the cask finish to the finishing linger. I agreed with the wood comment but personally had more floral finish. Rich, smooth, high notes of the ""good"" Jameson spices. Black tea, the faintest hint of a waft of pipe smoke, malt balance finish the tongue.

Finish:
Isnt fierce like a lot of bottling with this depth. Isnt the profile to put you in the mood to pound but tastes so good you could get in trouble fast. Clean and crisp for having so much to enjoy and savor. Makes you want to sip again and find more layers like an old trusty leather bag. 

Ice makes it perfect to sip sip sip but spheres/BIG pieces/rock cubes+mineral may be the secret here... standard cube shape isnt enough...

Overall:
Outstanding but sadly discontinued and replaced at a higher (slightly)price point by the 18yr. Perfect celebration bottle--Johnny Blue type of special. For all of the positive mentioned thus far I rate it 92/100. Top-shelf assuredly.  Worth any price ~100USD alllll day. I know it secondhands far higher. 

If you see this dusty and it hasn't been baking in the heat:BUY IT!!!"

4.0,"This is a discontinued expression. I overpaid for it out of sheer curiosity. Ex-bourbon and ex-olorosso. 40%. Obviously it's a 12-year old, though Distiller claims it contains stock as old as 17 years.

Nose: Heavy on the roasted almonds. Some chestnut and walnut as well. Plenty of pecan to boot. Vanilla and caramel. Nutmeg and clove spice, along with a ton of black pepper. Ever so slightly grainy and metallic, but the malt component dominates here. Raisin, honey, and toffee. Date and fig. Big-time lemon citrus. Some apple, pear, honeydew, and apricot. Solid nose.

Palate. Roasted almonds persist, and right off the bat. The walnut, chestnut, and pecan also be found. That goes for the vanilla and caramel as well. Wider array of fruit notes here. Red apple, pear, apricot, grapefruit, honeydew, strawberry, and some white grape. More toffee and honey. Again, a great deal of black pepper. The palate ups the fruit presence and drops the spice besides the black pepper. Well done here.

Finish: A bit of the roasted almond and black pepper carry over from the palate, and then it's all vanilla, honey, apple, and pear. Somewhere between medium and short in length, which is surprising for a 40%'er.

I quite like this one. 4 stars flat. That puts it tied with Cooper's Croze for best my highest-rated Jameson expression. Head and shoulders above the similarly-priced Jameson Gold. This one has plenty to offer from start to finish, and has a unique profile for an Irish whiskey. Barely metallic on the nose, and that disappears altogether upon taste. No shortbread cookie, which I get on 9/10 Irish whiskies. It's a blend, but the malt component dominates.

So, there's plenty to like here. At $100, is it worth it? Probably not. But I don't regret buying it. This and the Jameson Gold were discontinued around the same time. The latter was only $5 cheaper, meaning that these two are comparable on paper. If I could only save one of the two, I'd choose this in a heartbeat. At $100, I can't guarantee it's worth the price of entry. But if curiosity is enough, this one delivers."
