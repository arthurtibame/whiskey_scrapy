3.25,"Nose - Butterscotch, cinnamon, vanilla, hint of cherry, oak

Taste - Oddly thin but drying, sweet cherry vanilla, caramel, cinnamon spice, oak, hint of woody bitterness

Finish - Light cinnamon tingle, light vanilla caramel, hint of bright red maraschino cherries

Score - 73/100

Final Thoughts - Surprisingly light on the nose. Fairly typical bourbon notes, nothing really offputting about it other than a faint woody bitterness on the back palate. Nothing too exciting about this one other than it's a fairly easy drinker. Typical bourbon notes, skewing towards a bit more on the fruity/cherry side, but not a rich dark cherry but the sort of fake red cherry.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"
