1.75,"Nose- Sweet berry jam, citrus, rubber, ginger, honey

Palate- Wet hay, strawberries, dark chocolate, rubber

Finish- Medium, chewy finish with notes of rubber and an odd sour note

Wow. Not. A. Fan. I’m usually a huge Deanston guy, but this one missed the mark for me. I could barely get through an oz. There’s rubber throughout (not a fan) and an odd sour note that I’ve never gotten before on a whisky that I do not enjoy. Theres some other odd flavors in there too that I can’t (and don’t want) to place. Pass."

4.5,"We have all heard the term ""Sherry Bomb"" and tried them.  Forget the rest.  If you like Sherry, this is the one.  Trust me...it's like having a rich glass of Olorosso Sherry. This is quality product both from start to finish."
5.0,"Great stuff with notes of chocolate, toffee, raisins, spices, citrus, and vanilla."
2.75,"Nose of peanut skins and spent match (ie sulphur, but not unpleasant). Rich, syrupy and slightly sweet to the taste. The finish is medium length and syrupy, a little spice, a little sulphur. I don’t know Deanston so can’t comment on how much the spirit is contributing here, but it feels predominantly cask driven. As such, it’s a decent enough sherry bomb, but not something I’d try more than once."
4.25,"Saltana, raisan, orange peel, carob and more going on here. I had a feeling with ex-olorosso i was on a winner but then again the previous two deanstons weren't that great. This definitely is despite slight sulfur taint..after I dropped a dollop of water in. It really opened up with several drops. 4  to 4.25 I reckon. It won't replace Glendronach 18 as my best standard pure ex-olorosso fare but it's up there."
