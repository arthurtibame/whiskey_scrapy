3.0,"In honor of 8 Speyside distilleries owned by Diageo, this blend was made for the Copper Dog whisky bar located inside the Craigellachie hotel.  A “copper dog” is also a device that looks a lot like a cork-topped test tube with an attached chain.  It is said that distillery workers used these to sneak whisky from casks to take home.

This blend is rich gold in color and creates medium legs and lots of large droplets inside your Glencairn.  It’s bottled at 40% and I picked this up online for $32.

The nose is butterscotch, apples and pears, red berries and some slight milk chocolate.  The casks also provides some weak vanilla and light oak aromas.  The palate is smooth, albeit quite watery.  There’s vanilla and sweet grapes and some orchard fruits.  The finish is expectedly short, yet slightly warming.  There’s a good bit of rich vanilla left behind.  It’s slightly mouthwatering.

Overall, it’s a fine blend for the money.  This should replace any and all uses of Johnnie Walker Red or Dewars White Label in your cocktails and can even be enjoyed neat or on the rocks.  If you’re looking for an extra, cheap bottle to add to an international order- see if the store has this in stock.  It’s solid and cheap.  3-3.25 stars.  Cheers."
3.5,"Easy drink. Not too exciting flavour wise but not boring either. 
Nice for a simple sip."

3.5,"PBM is on the money with notes of pears, apricots and honey. To add there is a slight caramel candyfloss thing going on as well, notes of white dry reisling. Slight ethanolly edge detracts slightly. Good value for the price."
4.25,So smooth. Butter and bread and fades into dryness.
4.0,Good neat

4.25,"For some reason, I thought Copperdog was an American distillery.  Until I tasted this, courtesy of a pour sent by @LeeEvolved. Notes of ripe pears, honey, apricots, with a clear indication of some age gave it away as being a Speysider instead of an American.  Really a well made blend, and if I’d tasted this blind, I’d have guessed it for a Balvenie 12.  Thanks Lee for the sample"

3.5,"Mixed in a Manhattan = mild and sweet. Tasted on its own, a solid blended scotch whiskey, but I bought for mixing."
3.25,"So I’ve been spending the time I used to allocate to reviews to my new and expanding YouTube channel, Dapper Drams, so I haven’t been able to taste much outside of what I plan to use for videos. Tonight I made time for a sample. I didn’t want anything too strong, so I picked the first sample I could find that was 40% and went with it. Copper Dog is a blended malt scotch comprised of single malts from 8 different Speyside distilleries. Bottled at 40% ABV like I said, and it appears to have colorant added making it a honey gold and is certainly chill filtered. 

The nose is a fairly rich, albeit light, honeyed profile typical of many Speyside distilleries. I’m getting both sherry and bourbon oak with more than a fair amount of cereal malt and barley sugar. A good deal of nuttiness like hazelnut or Brazil, some nice pipe tobacco, as well as a hint of smoke. Baked apples and pears, pie crust, a bit confectionary but not too sweet. Rather elegant vanilla, peaches and cream and mixed berries. Some low quality toffee and caramel in there as well. A rather nice nose, much more than I was expecting. 

The palate is a bit peppery on the arrival, more so than I would have thought given it’s only 40%. Honey and cereal malt with a hint of clove. Bittersweet apples and pears, very much a step down from the nose. Toffee and caramel, oak and tannins, slightly astringent. Some vanilla and a hint of coconut, not much else. A rather bitter and disappointing palate. 

A light to medium light bodied mouthfeel, watery and fairly dry. 
The finish is medium length with honey, toffee, vanilla and bitter oak tannins. 

The nose was surprisingly good and the highlight of this blend. The palate though...another story altogether. It’s quite off putting and ruins everything the nose had going for it. I would rate the nose near a 4, but the palate only a 2.5. So I’ll split the difference and give this blend a 3.25. Thanks to @LeeEvolved for the sample and make sure you check out his new segment on Dapper Drams called Fresh Takes. 
Cheers"

2.75,"Nose: Very dry apple cider, so bright it's almost like cider vinegar. Some light cereal notes and a little oak in the background. A drop of water mellows the nose considerably and deepens the overall tone.

Palate: Very bright, almost effervescent arrival with the same apple cider character as the nose but here on the palate it is sweet and you can just barely taste some cereal notes. The texture is watery and there is no development at all, the initial flavours pass directly into the finish. However a drop of water broadens the palate and gives it a little more texture.

Finish: Like lightning, there's a quick spicy flash and then it fades out to empty blackness with only a watery cereal aftertaste.

A most curious blend - exceptionally easy and mild, almost dangerously easy to drink, but also thin and pallid. The overwhelming character is reminiscent of a dilute version of that type of hard apple cider that has a spirity vinegar-like aroma which is not unpleasant, but miles away from soft fresh apple juice.

This is also very possibly the fastest profile I've ever tasted. Seriously, 30 seconds after you swallow there is hardly a hint it was ever on your palate. However on the plus side there are no off-notes at all , no metallic or sulphur stain, and no bitterness.

Water greatly improves this blend and I'd guess the good folks at the Craigellachie Hotel commissioned this specifically to have a profile that works particularly well as a soft, easy drinking session whisky with ice and soda water.

There's not much substance to it and I'd never buy it again, but on the other hand it's in no way offensive. I'm settling on 2.75 stars, which puts it just below both Monkey Shoulder and Naked Grouse on my shelves. The quality is just as good, but the profile is insipid.

""Average"" : 2.75 stars"

3.25,"Man, wish I was better at this.  Been sitting here for 10 minutes trying to figure out what's on the nose with Copper Dog.  Best guess is some orange or other citrus and cereal.  On the tongue it's a bit thin, some spice a hint of smoke, something sweet, perhaps some vanilla or white chocolate.  But, all and all pretty light.  I'd lean toward Naked Grouse instead."

3.0,"Bit of lemon taste to it slightly bitter taste kinda watery, get monkey shoulder instead"
2.5,"The nose is somewhat thin, though not unpleasant. The initial taste is also thin, bringing to mind grass and grain. The finish is enjoyable, though again grain is foremost. All in all, it's a pleasant dram that asks little of the taster..."

2.5,"Nose of pear, apple. Taste is a bit musty, some vanilla, spiced, wood notes. Not too complex"
2.5,"Corn, acetone, honey, vanilla, and candy corn on the nose. Corn and heat on the finish.  Too young, needs more time in the barrel to mellow.  (Advent calendar day 3.)"
2.5,"Nose is stewed apples and pears, slight hint of pure spirit and some almonds

Palate is light and uneventful

2.75,"A bit too much taste of alcohol for drinking on its own, but good for mixing."
3.0,"You get all the ex-bourbon flavour profile straight on the nose right in the middle so that's all the sugary, candy, toffee and vanilla.

Very gentle wave of all the sugary goodness goes in while you feel green apple or maybe even a drop of lemon in the background. You will get the oak bitterness almost like a dry black tea just subtle not too much in the end.

Overall it's a sugary goodness whiskey so you can enjoy with your friends with our thinking too much or needed to examined each individual profiles just have a good time."
4.0,"This vatted (blended) malt caught my attention here on proof66 a few weeks ago. ""What an interesting name, have never heard of it"" I thought. I checked for online reviews, found four or five and all were positive. I decided to give it a try if I could locate it. Finally found a source in NY that would ship and took the plunge. If my research on this is correct, this malt blend was the brainchild of the folks at the Craigellachie Hotel, where the Copper Dog bar is located. It is a NAS blend of 8 (or more) Speyside malts. Diageo is taking care of the marketing distribution and owns a minority interest. This vatted malt came in to existence in 2016. (The term ""copper dog"" came about because it was such a good friend to many distillery workers in past years. It was a length of copper pipe, a coin soldered to one end a cork in the other, the whole thing attached to a chain to allow it to be carried out of sight down a pants leg. When convenient, it could be dropped through the open bung of a barrel, taking a few drams of the owners whisky to be taken home, no one the wiser. I found a couple neat videos on youtube demonstrating these) ON TO THE TASTING: This vatted malt is in the price range of Monkey Shoulder and Naked Grouse, but apparently not as readily available. It noses of malt, honey-comb, vanilla. and a touch of ripe orchard fruit--peach I think. On the tongue these are all present with an overall butterscotch note. It is full flavored, soft in the mouth, and a very pleasant dram--but, not an outstanding dram if you are a long time Scotch drinker and are searching for stronger or more defined flavors. This is a solid ""middle of the road"" malt blend. That makes sense, for the Craigellachie folks said they were looking for a good mixer to compete for the customers who were not so much ""Scotch drinkers,"" but mixed drink drinkers using spirits other than whisky. This is a solid blend. However, I drink my Scotch neat, and there are better choices for the same money for me."
