5.0,"This is an amazing whisky with one of the best noses out there. Rye, dark fruit, apricot, marmalade. P: a bit of varnish (from higher abv?), then pine needles and pepper. F: dry, (industrial), rye, maybe some coffee, medium"

3.75,Starts creamy before developing a decent spicy bite mid-palette. There’s a note like a vanilla wafer. Soft and creamy finish. Another excellent whisky from G&W and great value at under $50 a bottle.
4.5,"World whisky online drammers pour. Very good.


Nose: Caramel, Peach, Vanilla, Cotton Candy, Walnuts, Cinnamon, Cloves, Grass, Peanuts, Baking Spices, Flowers

Palate: Caramel, Peanuts, Chocolate, Cherry, Peach, Pepper, Cloves, Dil, Cinnamon, Dried Fruit, Apricot, Maple

Finish: Vanilla, Maple, Caramel, Cherry, Peach, Chocolate, Walnuts"
4.5,"Light amber/dark gold in colour. 

Nose: Fairly complex.  Vanilla and maple with notes of nutmeg and spice.  Brings French toast to mind!

Palate: Initially rich and sweet with a nice combination of maple and cereal notes.  Rye spice suddenly and surprisingly kicks in with black peppery goodness.  Dried fruit, especially raisin, enters the equation here as well. 

Finish: Medium for flavour but long for mouthfeel; some tannins present on the tip and sides of the tongue as well as the back of the palate. 

Slightly harsh but overall a fantastic, complex whisky - well done Dr. Don!"
4.25,"Sweet, caramel, brown sugar, spice, apple, milk chocolate, orange cherries."

4.0,"Smooth, sweet and well balanced with caramel/toffee, oak, and rye spice notes. Similar to Wiser's Legacy but smoother, more toffee/corn sweetness. It’s only held back a bit by it’s slightly dry bitter finish. It’s still my pick for the best readily available Canadian Whisky. $50 in Ontario."

4.0,"Almost absurdly flavorful. Definite neat, must get. Vancouver trip 2016"
4.0,"An interesting whisky. Its Canadian heritage is recognizable (and I am, frankly, no fan of most Canadian whiskies), but there's a complexity and delicacy here that's pretty likeable. Smell is a nice cedar wood, some rye spice, creamed corn, dill pickle, an interesting medicinal cherry syrup. Sharpie marker or some paint thinner. Vanilla. Taste is sweet and spice. A nice floral, with loads of rye, baking spices and brining spices (clove, caraway, dill, pepper). More of that medicinal cherry, pencil shavings, creamed corn, lots of white pepper on the back-end. Dry finish is a bit short with some spice. Unlike most Canadian whiskies, this one doesn't teeter way over into sweetness--it's recognizably Canadian, but actually quite balanced, quite interesting. Resembles, slightly, some of Forty Creek's high-end offerings, but with the sweetness really dialed back. The *actual* closest comparison, though, might be to Wiser's Red Letter--but at $70 *less* per bottle, it's actually a pretty decent value if you want to give Canadian whisky another shot."

4.0,"When I first approached this whiskey I could not figure it out. The nose had  some solvent, the taste seemed all Rye, but the finish mellow sweet. After more time and coming back to it another night I find I am enjoying it considerably.  The nose still has has something that get's in my way, but I can pick up light cherries and oranges. The taste is excellent. Smooth, coating, not too sweet like many Canadian whiskies. The rye spice is healthy and worth savoring. The finish is very interesting. Mostly dry and medium length, but maybe it's the wheat, I find something creamy or bready. This is an excellent whisky and I would recommend it anyone coming from a single malt Scotch background. (3.5 stars)"

3.5,Received a bottle for Christmas last year. Rye spice like pike creek a nice blend harmonious not the best or worst I’ve had a semi affordable sipping whiskey but like something like even $25 Gibson’s 12 more :) or pike creek port barrel finish or rum finish better had a burn
4.0,"Nose of toffee, complex and subtile taste. Very good Canadian Whisky and very good price quality."

5.0,"It's earthy and complex in all the right ways. The mash bill provides a nice balance. Toasted woody tannins, rye spiciness, and some sweetness from the corn and wheat... I really like this! It's bold and can easily hang with some of those really good mid-range bourbons. I'm a fan of drinking my whisky neat from a Glencairn glass, but I have to imagine this stuff would lend well to a nice classic cocktail. For the price, you can't go wrong. If you see it, get it."
5.0,"Not only is it great to see G & W producing whisky again but it's also a great flagship whisky for their reviving line.

Grains in lovely balance with that classic Canadian rye spice giving the blend a nice spicy pop."

5.0,"The G&W Four Grain has now become my favourite whisky!  It’s flavours are tightly intertwined, complex and subtle.  Best to let it sit in the glass for a while first.  On the nose, caramel, dark fruits, sweet dusty cereals, and a hint of black pepper, and lots more too.  The palate starts with the sweet caramel and opens up into a kaleidoscope of chewy and delicious flavours almost impossible to pick apart, before merging again inside spicy wood notes.  Though you can sense the other grains there, they humbly submit to their role of enhancing the rye which takes the spotlight.  It ends with a nice medium finish, bringing with it a bit of bitterness and some cherry, along with a hint of roast beef... wait, that was the leftovers my wife just reheated in the microwave.  This creative Canadian whisky makes me proud!"

3.75,"Well this was a nice surprise. Some really pleasant spice and cinnamon notes, vanilla. Very Christmassy feel to it."
2.0,Too fruity and floral for my liking.
3.75,"lightly spicy, a little mossy, nose is almost cinnamon. taste is grainy, ryey. reminds me of something baked in winter time. pretty smooth, like i said light burn - a good whiskey. so far the best out of this damn canadian gift set i was given."
1.0,"I have to disagree with many of the reviewers here. I had high expectations because I’m a big fan of Lot 40 and respect the work of Dr. Don Livermore, but I found this whisky to be nearly awful. The ethanol overwhelms the palate. It gets a bit better on the rocks but still can’t appreciate it nor discover its subtlety. Perhaps it’s this batch? The notes and flavours are drowned out by the ethanol. Might as well be vodka."
4.5,"This is an amazing whiskey, one of the few best I have tasted. It is very atypical, both complex and very easy to enjoy. Interestingly perceptible influence of the wheat, the corn and the rye with a perfect balance. a delicious, profond, suprising whisky.

Nose: 
Dried and slightly dusty cereals, raisins macerating in spiced rum, crème brûlée crust, cherries, a lot of sweetness.
Very rich, complex and powerful.

Palate: 
Very aromatic, an explosion of flavours. A lot of what was in the nose comes back on the palate. Very sweet and pleasantly liquorous. Very refined taste. Brown sugar, some blackberry fruit paste. The colour brown comes to mind when I have this in my mouth. 

Finish: 
Medium length. More woodiness, a lot drier than before but still a good sweetness. A return of the raisins in rum.

Price/quality is absolutely insane, +0.5 for that.

You absolutely need to taste this."
