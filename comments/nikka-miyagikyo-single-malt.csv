Something's missing in this whisky as well, and I can't put my finger on it, but I know it's the difference from one of the best and a dram I'd leave for someone else to enjoy"

2.0,"Oh god, I tried this in Japan and I mostly got burn and bitterness. Yes, it's the bolder, peatier side of Taketsuru, the alcohol is stronger, the bourbon cask is fiercer, there is a bit of sherry in there... But I was essentially appalled by this, despite being a big Nikka fan. Nikka from the Barrel, Taketsuru and even Nikka All Malts and Coffey Grain are ones I'd rather have over this."

4.0,"On the Nose -Spice, Old Wood, Fresh mint, lemon grass, sea breeze, leather.
On the palate - more spice but not too hot of you let it breathe for 20 minutes or so. Afraid to add a drop of water since it taste so complex and so damn good. You will want to take your time on this one for sure. Good price buy one if you see it before they disappear. Highly recommended after a good meal. Paid like 60"

3.0,"Had this during a business dinner some time back.  Generally, I've disliked NAS Japanese whiskies, just seems to be a shell of it's aged versions.  I""ve not tasted the aged version of MIyagikyo, so fortunately, haven't been jaded (yet).  Nose: floral and summer-y.  Taste:  roasted nuts, mild.  Non-challenging, but so very not complex.  Like a Balvenie...can't do no wrong, but nothing that makes you go 'wow'.  Finish:  quick, mild.  Not a bad NAS version, better than the NAS Yoichi for sure.  Not sure what the price is, but I'd not pay over $50 for it.  You can get better complexity elsewhere for that price (Great King St is the first that comes to mind)"

3.0,"Nose - Buttery, fruity, yellow cake, caramelized pears, waxy golden raisins.
Taste - Fruity, syrupy but crisp sweet, hint of white pepper spice, fresh pears eaten with golden raisins, very faint quickly fading bitter, tiniest hint of campfire smoke.
Finish - Lingering lightly smoky sweet, syrupy golden raisins, which lead me to believe this was aged in a lighter colored sherry, tiny hint of campfire ash.
Score - 79/100
Final Thoughts - On the nose, I don't think you could tell that there was any hint of peat in this malt as the syrupy/waxy sweet dominates. Once it hits the tongue, you're hit with the sensation as if you were at a campsite in the morning making oatmeal with golden raisins & honey with the campfire from last night out, but the smoke still lingers in the air. The finish is like you've finished your oatmeal and you take a deep breath of the crisp autumn air that still has that tiny hint of campfire ash. Overall a decent dram that's very sippable neat but is kind of just light smoke & golden raisin sweet to me. I can see this making a very interesting highball."

4.0,"This whisky is almost worth the price for the aroma alone. A wonderful combination of pretty sherry fruit and wet peat. Afterwards there are subtle vanilla malt and earthy spices. On the palate the sherry is displayed in the most favorable way. Offering tiny ripe berries, sweet malt, and roasted nuts. The finish gently breathes smoke down your throat like a seductress that is a little more kinky than you thought. Great NAS whisky!"
2.0,"The nose is floral, but somewhat sulphury. The palate has a sweet citrus note, some malted cereal, followed by a touch of aniseed on the finish. Unfortunately, the off-key notes on the nose ruined it for me. Disappointed."
4.0,"The nose is complex, and though not exactly sherried, it is quite fruity with an underlying layer of nuttiness. The almonds and clove on the palate play very nice here, with the finish continuing and rounding off a great experience. I like it."

Miyagikyo is deep, lush, rich, with hints of tropical fruit, dried fruit, a touch grassy, an almond, hazelnut and herbal note, and a decent touch of peat. Lovely stuff."

I got bubblegum scent and on the palate floral and light honey and vanilla. To busy chatting to gather much more but nice dram, one of the better japanese offerings I've had in the price range. 3.5 to 3.75.

Update: Another year another sample. Smells almost like mild mescal. 3.5 I reckon lower range of what i once thought."

Palate: Picking season cherry orchard.

To be most honest, when tasting a friend on it, the finish was still lingering 15~20 minutes after. One of my favorite Japanese whiskys from one of the most consistently excellent distillers."

Finish: Long and grainy, reminiscent of a nice Irish whisky. Very slight hint of peat lingers, but appropriately subtle.  Very pleasant!"
4.0,"Mild-mannered and citrusy on the nose, with honey and lemons and dates and almost no heat.  There’s some burn in the mouth, though, along with an Irish-like biscuit note.  Long finish of something resembling pasta.  Angular and really refreshing as a change of pace.  I think I like it more than the conventional wisdom would dictate."

1.75,"Nose - red fruits, honey, vanilla, light pastry crust, a hint of soft younger oak, strawberries.

Taste - banana, vanilla, toasted oak, some cream, and then the funky sherry wine note, very bitter. Miyagikyo brings the funky oak from the sherry really out with youthful spirit note and a lot of vanilla's and some new maker spirit elements. A bit of water seems to bring this one more to life, enhancing the sherry and pushing back some of that youth.  Noticing some light peat notes here as well, I wasn't aware this is peated but if it is not, I'm way off and maybe I'll delete this review, but I'm getting more than a little peat. Perhaps the peat is some of the bitter notes I thought were from the sherry.

This is an interesting effort from Nikka, while I do generally think there's quality here, it's just too young. The peat is not helping with the sherry. Honestly, i'd rather get more of the sweet nikka malt with sherry.

I'm going 1.75 here, same score as the Yoichi though I'm more a peat guy so I'd buy the Yoichi again before this one. Neither are likely to be repeat buys unless I find them a bit more affordable."

3.75,"Nose: Grassy and mildly earthy with a lot of citrus notes - lemon zest, orange concentrate, grapefruit - bright citrus rather than sweet and there's a little pineapple as well. A leathery honeyed note creeps in at the sides to keep things interesting. The nose gains substantial complexity and breadth as it opens and when first poured the ethanol is a bit punchy so allow a few minutes for it to develop. A dash of water enhances the nose by bringing out floral notes (lilies, jonquils, honeysuckle). Most elegant and enjoyable.

Palate: Lovely easy arrival. Sweet, rounded, honeyed cereal flavours, almonds and warm spices. Very friendly and there is a pleasant puff of smoke on the palate that emerges a few seconds after the arrival. A little beeswax and vanilla with some berry and sweet white grape notes on the palate. In the late development and finish a distinct milk chocolate flavour is apparent. The texture is excellent and has a creamy density that is very satisfying. Adding a drop of water softens and sweetens the palate.

Finish: Medium/short. Leathery sweet-malt taste with some musky floral and charcoal-like smoke on the aftertaste.

There's a handsome, sweaty farmyard quality to this whisky that is very enjoyable. It's a little like a polite and graceful Japanese version of Ben Nevis or Hazelburn. Adding water is not necessary at all as this is very nice neat, however neither does it do any harm but simply sweetens and lightens the profile.

Tasted from a 30ml sample (thank you Wei). I'm considering adding a bottle to my next whisky order. It's the same price here as Nikka Coffey Malt, and it would be a tough choice between the two.

""Good, just a whisker below Very Good"" : 3.75 stars (and it's quite possible that with time to explore a whole bottle I'd raise that to 4 stars)."

4.5,"Nikka Whisky is rightfully sought after as they don't have a Whisky in their portfolio that isn't good. Furthermore, whilst not always readily available they can be found with some hunting at a very reasonable SRP. This specific expression from Nikka is one of the 2 single malts they produce (the other being the Yoichi). For me this is truly the crown jewel of the Nikka NAS releases! Why is that? Let's dive in and find out... 

It enters rich and fruity with a burst of apricots, plums and nougat. There is some salt and smoke also present in the background that provides a wonderful compliment. Ripe berries and a hint of seaweed on the mid palate with a long finish that adds oak and dark chocolate to the party. Wood spice lingers on the tongue.

This one is really a proper classic sherried whisky! It's like an old school Glendronach that retains the soul of Nikka. TGIF all and stay safe!"
