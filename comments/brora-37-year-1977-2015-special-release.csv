5.0,"I tried it today. Took my breath away. No peaty scent on the nose, very smooth and light. The taste takes you on a journey and the peatiness hits you in waves, but does not overpower. Not spicy, almost sweet. It's been in mixed casks so you can taste the sherry. Mature, deliberate, slow burn. Very well balanced. Hands down best whiskey I've had."

5.0,"Birthday night 1 of 2. We ended up at Jack Rose with a line up that included:

Talisker 30 OB 2011 at 45.8%
Port Ellen DL Old Malt Cask 1983/2006 at 50%
Johnnie Walker Blue Brora & Rare at 46%
Brora 35 OB 1978/2014 at 48.6%

The real Brora won. I have this 1977/2015 bottle, but am afraid to open it. Having now tried the 2014 release, I know I will have to open it at some point. 

This is an expensive hobby, and for the absolute best Scotches, you really cannot put a price on it. I don’t care if these are selling for thousands of dollars at auction, giving up the opportunity to open this for myself is unthinkable. 

The marriage of flavors in here is beyond what my words can muster. Every flavor on the wheel, but especially grapefruit, lemon oil (is that a thing?), leather, Uni, bandaids, and peaches. The texture is almost gooey like foie gras. 

An easy summary for the overindulged mind: best whisky I have ever tried.
