4.25,"Nose: Rye is dominant smell, but I also get a weird (but pleasant) mint gum smell.  Spearmint maybe?  

Palate: once again, the  spicy rye flavor dominates, but great oak and clove flavors come through.  Was expecting a very thin mouthfeel, but for just the opposite.  Coats the tongue well and is full of flavor!

Finish: Medium in length.  Wa expecting a bit of a burn out of a 93 proof rye, but not really there.  Extremely smooth.   

Overall: possibly the best $29 bottle of whisky I’ve had.  I’ve always been a big fan of Baby Saz but Riverset surprisingly outperforms it in every way.  This whisky will win some awards and deservingly so.   Get a bottle of you can find it.  Actually, get two bottles.   You’ll thank me."
