3.0,"This rye seems like hipster catnip.  It's a single barrel rye from a small distillery in New Mexico, under a revived brand from the early 19th century whose founder was killed during the Taos Revolt of 1847, and named after a distillery worker (Albert) who fought in a siege during that revolt.  This rye is five years old, so similar in age to Sazerac.  I also get a very similar profile to Sazerac in the nose and palate:  scents of coffee along with a clear rye base; pears, pineapple, plenty of rye spice, and that cleaning solution impression; and a smooth finish that is mostly sweet and not as spicy, with a rich mouthful of bread and grain.   It's $60 a bottle, so not cheap for a rye, but worth trying."
