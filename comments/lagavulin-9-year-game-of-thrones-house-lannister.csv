4.5,"Amazing whisky from Lagavulin. At worst, I feared it was going to be a sell-out gimmick. At best, I figured it would be a slightly harsher version of the 8yr. I was happily surprised - smoky, peaty, and smooth."

4.0,"Cereal, and dried or stewed fruits, and ashy, similar ashiness as what I get from Caol Ila. Spiciness here and there. Though it's somewhat harsh, nose to palate - not unpleasantly harsh, just intenser than I'd dreamt - alcohol is there present in a representing way. Chocolate is found in the finish.

No, it does not roar. I care less than nothing about GoT - too violent for me, not that if it's not a great show or what. I was interested about the 9 age statement, like all the other pros.

Though, somehow, for Lagavulin's profile, it's too young, same thought I have for Lagavulin 8 - the 16 is the thing. Not everything else can be too young, but Lagavulin? Nah.

Well, right, so it roars somewhat."

4.75,"This and the Talisker GoT were the only ones I was personally interested in having.  This is simply a classic Lagavulin.  If you enjoyed the 8 yr old, it’s similar.  Smoky embers on the onset, strong vanilla backbone (which I’m a bit surprised at...didn’t see that coming), and burnt ashes.  Considering how smoky this is, I would’ve thought it would’ve been Daenerys’ Taragarean dragons.  Either way, so much better than that piss poor JW White Walker.  This was good enough for me to buy a bottle after trying the free sample.  Even if it had nothing to do with GoT, I’d still have bought it.  For $65, it’s worth it."

4.5,"This is Lagavulan.  And yet it's not.  The smoke is there like the Lagavulan 16, but it's more mellow than its older counterpart.  The finish is long and savory.  If the 16 is ordering a big, meaty Texas brisket, then the 9 is like ordering ribs.  Still awesome.  Still smokey, but a slightly different experience.  Pick it up while you can.  This one and the Talisker are worth whatever you can find them for.

As for the GOT tie-in, I'm with many of the other reviewers here in thinking that this would have been a better fit for house Targaryen, but it's not the strangest pairing of a house with a single malt in this collection, and the whisky is good enough that I won't dock it for being mismatched with a GOT house."

4.0,"Smells very Smokey and Peaty, basic Lagavulin and regionally appropriate. Tastes slightly sweet to me but evens out to peat/smoke notes."
4.0,"My first lagavulin, and it didn't disappoint. From what I've heard of the 8 (being a young and a bit blunt in its tastes), I'd say the extra year of aging mellowed it considerably. Chances are, all the bottles are spoken for. So if you want one, either prepare to pay secondary market, or get to work on that time machine.

smells a bit apple and smoke
tastes the same with the addition of some honey and light peat"

4.5,"Verdict- awesome. Johnnie Walker White Walker was a mass production sell out. They made it boring and sweet for appeal. Lagavulin did a fantastic job with the 9yr. Still peated and smokey, possibly lightly sweet finish?. It’s great. I’m happy they didn’t sell out like JW and dumb it down for cocktail drinking fans."

4.0,"If you’ve ever been held up in Canada by an accident involving a truck load of pigs and a maple syrup transporter*, prepare for a sensorial flashback: bacon, dark sugar and petrol waft out of the glass of this sprightly Lagavulin. And if an ice-cream truck was also involved in the aforementioned accident, then you’ll recognize the creamy vanilla that coats your throat on the finish. An excellent whisky that, along with the 8-year-old, suggests I may have a preference for youthful Lagavulin. Never has a highway disaster tasted so good.

4.25,"Info: l'une des 8 bouteilles du release de Game Of Thrones de 2018 (une neuvième pour le nightwatch par JW). L'une des deux seules bouteilles non-NAS (avec le Royal Lochnagar 12) et le deuxieme plus cher du lot  (120 CAD ici en SAQ). Cette bouteille représente la Maison Lannister (chacune en représente une différente). Un des repproche que l'on voit souvent sur les réseau sociaux et les forums est qu'ils ont ""miss-matched"" les différentes maisons avec les distilleries (ex: Targaryen-feu-sherry vs un Cardhu weak... ça fit pas pentoute). Au delà du marketing, il s'agit d'un produit 100% de l'ile d'Islay vieilli en ex-fut de bourbon et dont on a ajouté du colorant.

Nez: sucré. Fumé et sucré. Caramel fumé. viandeux. du jambon foret-noir saucé dans le syrop. Une touche médicinale qui rappelle Laphroaig... étrange. légèrement iodé. Maritime. Sel de mer apporté par une brise fraiche. 

Bouche: Rien qui était au nez que l'on ne retrouve pas en bouche: Jambon fumé-syrop/caramel et sel iodé. Le tout ensemble rappelle de la sauce BBQ. Plus loin, on retrouve un côté fruité... des ananas, des bananes et du jus de citron fraichement pressé. C'est jeune comme liquide mais, la texture est belle.

Final: Longue. Fumé-boisé sur le chêne les bananes et une touche d'algue amer et salé. Après quelque seconde que le liquide a passé, quelque chose de frais... des herbes... de la coriandre.

Overall: C'est doux. Grand publique mais tourbé à la Lagavulin. Quelqu'un qui n'aime pas la tourbe ne changera probablement pas d'idée après celui-là. Quelqu'un qui aime déjà Lagavulin sera probablement déçu pour la simple raison qu'il s'agit d'une version inférieur du 16 ans qui est le même prix. Inutile de dire que le rapport qualité-prix n'est pas au rendez-vous. L'absence de finish en fut de sherry fait en sorte que le champs aromatique se rapproche plus du Lagav 12 que du 16. Imaginez-vous une version du 12 ans de 2016 plus jeune de 3 ans et dilué à 46%. Bref, rien de mauvais mais, je n'ai pas été jeté par terre par cette édition. Amateurs avancés, vous pouvez passer sans regret. Amateur débutant, probable que vous ne soyez pas enchanté non plus. C'est plus une bouteille de soirée facile à boire qu'une bouteille à décortiqué de façon concentré... tsé quand tu veux pas amener du stock que tu trip trop de peur que ça s'envole trop vite mais que tu veux quand même boire quelque chose qui fait du sens... et bien, c'est ce genre de bouteille. Un peu ce que le An Oa est à Ardbeg, le lagavulin 9 est une bonne bouteille mais la moins impressionnante de la gamme. 86%"

4.0,"Nose: peat and smoke dominate. I get a strange almost green bean smell often found in soul food. You know the ones cooked in bacon fat? Delicious, rich and full nose. 

Taste: very oily with a nicely rounded peatyness and sweet pipe tobacco taste. Leads immediately into a salted caramel creme (almost like those little caramel cream candies with the little white center). After that I don’t get much but that’s not a bad thing. The whiskey is so oily that flavor lasts a good 30-40 seconds after you swallow. WHATCH YOUR BREATH IF YOU’RE TRYING TO TALK UP A LADY OR GENTLEMEN!! Close quarters could be off putting to, let’s be honest, most people out there. 

All things said I was very impressed by this. The 16 year has always been one of my favorites. But at $100 a pop in my state, I often pass it by. The 9 is a great alternative running around $30 cheaper."

4.0,"Nice pour, nice peat, nice finish. Liked the Talisker game of thrones a tad better, but still a good one and would get again if it was available."
4.5,"I haven't watched GoT, but I've seen bits and pieces of the show. From what I do know, House Targaryen would've been the most logical selection to pair with Lag with their connection to dragons.

That aside, I was skeptical of these releases. I figured that they'd be simple and inoffensive, ideal for the whisky novices that would inevitably buy these releases in droves. That being said, age-stated Lagavulin is age-stated Lagavulin. Loved the 8 so I can actually justify having expectations for this 9-year.

Nose: Classic Lag campfire-peat smoke. Sea salt and seaweed give this some maritime quality. There's also quite a bit of cirtus: grapefruit and lemon. Smoked brisket and spicy cinnamon (from the respectable 46% ABV). Also heavy chili note. A nice touch of oak in the background. Classic Lag. Great start.

Palate: Oily and smoky. It's that same campfire smoke, smoked brisket, and spicy chili. The sea salt is still present, but it becomes less prominent as the cinnamon and black pepper spices step to the forefront. Lemon and grapefruit citrus notes are ever-present. There are some unexpectedly light notes of green apple, vanilla, custard, toffee, and maybe a slight honey and milk chocolate. Oak presence is still strong.

Finish: Long, smoky, and spicy. Big cinnamon, black pepper, and oak notes. Some drying sea salt on the way out.

I can't speak on any of the other releases (I'd expect good things from the Talisker as well). But I'll say this: this is not just some gimmick. I'm sure that most of this lineup was little more than a cash grab, but Lagavulin did not take this assignment lightly.

It may well be my least favorite Lagavulin, but that really isn't much of an insult. The 8, 12, 16, and DE all scored at least a 4.5 if I remember correctly. Lagavulin has always done me well, and nothing changes with this one. $80 is a bit steep for what this is, but I understand that this release is tied to the greatest cultural phenomenon of the decade. If you're a Lag fan or a peat-head, this is worth your time if you can spare the money. It's the most subtle of any Lag expression I've tried, but still holds its own as a worthy dram.

Re-tasted a few days later and decided that the 4.5 is more appropriate. Still may rank it last on Lag list, but once again, it doesn't mean much when I rate everything from them through the roof."

3.5,"I think I’m overdue to review another Game of Thrones themed scotch whisky.  This is the one I think I was most excited for when the distillery list was officially released:  Lagavulin.  Now, to be honest, I’m not a diehard Laga fan like, say, Parks & Rec actor Nick Offerman.  They have a staple whisky with their 16yo offering and I also enjoyed the 8yo that they released for their 200th anniversary (which quickly became a core range release).  Owner, Diageo, also releases a cask strength, 12yo as part of their annual, limited releases and I’d have to say that is my favorite Lagavulin.

So, the Game of Thrones release is a 9yo whisky that’s bottled at 46%.  I’m sure there’s added color (to make it exactly the same as the rest of the GoT bottles).  I do believe it is still non-chill filtered, however.  It’s bronze in color and still looks very watery in the Glencairn.  It produces a few large drops after a spin, but they tend to stick to the glass.

The nose is a meaty, charcoal smoke at first.  Some light mint and citrus peel fold around the smoke before turning sweeter than I expected.  Fresh cut oak provides a strong backbone here, though.  The palate strikes me as overly sweet on the initial sip.  I get cotton candy and vanilla creams crowding the smoked beef and lightly abrasive oak and young juice.  It seems like the sweet side is fighting with the smoky side- and neither can gain control or a strong foothold.  The later batches of the 16yo seemed to have this same issue, albeit the whisky was much more smooth due to the extra maturation time.  The finish is long and slightly harsh.  There’s a dry smoke on the back of the tongue and lingering vanilla.

Overall, I’m not sure I’m a big fan of this whisky.  It’s a quality release from Lagavulin, but I tend to like the higher proof or the straight smoky aspect from this distillery.  The sherry cask parts seem to overpower the peat in this malt.  So, my score isn’t me indicating that this is a subpar malt, it’s just my opinion towards a flavor profile that I don’t prefer from Lagavulin.  Give me the 8yo and 12yo CS every time and I’ll be a happy man.  This is just a 3.5 star dram for me.  I fully understand that your mileage may vary.  Cheers."

Palate: Smoke, peat and brine at first, which last for the whole time spent in the mouth. Vanilla, caramel and citrus peel just after.
Finish: medium lasting sweet finish. VERY long lasting smoke.

Worth it? I'd say yes. A different take on Lagavulin.  Does not reach the complexity of the 16 YO, but is pretty balanced. Much sweeter."

4.25,"Game of Thrones is done and gone...but the whisky lives on. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe this is the recent 8 year old with an added year of sherry maturation tacked onto it. I gave that one a 4.25, let’s see how this one compares. Bottled at 46% ABV and is most likely chill filtered and definitely has colorant added to make it exactly the same color as the other GoT releases, a solid amber. 

Immediate heavy peat smoke on the nose, thick and wonderful. Very salty and briny with strong phenolic notes of creosote, smoldering coals, damp wood and earth. The peat influence steps aside after a while to reveal lemon custard, vanilla, vanilla cake batter and almond flour. A sherry sweetness with tons of fruits, orange zest, tangerines, apricots, plums and raisins. Letting it sit a bit longer brings out more sweetness, like frosted sugar cookies and toffee. 

A powerful arrival on the palate with spice and billowing smoke. Dry oak, peppery, anise and ashes. Grilled fruits make their way in just like on the nose, apricots and plums. A sugary sweetness along with the spice, lemon custard and vanilla. Brine, maritime notes and a bit mineral as well. Classic Islay. 

A medium to full bodied mouthfeel that is oily, creamy and mouth coating. 
The finish is medium long, smoky, ashes, peat and anise. 

It’s a Lagavulin, what’s more to be said?  Amazing, that’s what. Similar to the 8 but with an added sweetness. The peat at times is intense, and at others restrained. It has an elegance in its intensity. The 46% really helps carry it and I wish the 16 year old would follow suit. Even though I think this edges out the 8, I’m giving it the same score of 4.25. 
Cheers

4.25,"So for the GOT Finale a month or so ago my buddy brings this bottle over to enjoy as we watch John stab the Kalesi and head back to the Nights Watch (after 30 mins of Disneyesqe scenes closing the loose ends 🤮). 
Prior to sampling this one the only other Lagavulin experience I had was the 16 yr expression which I absolutely love! My expectations for this dram where not particularly high and I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It's very different from the 16 but in a good way. So much so that I convinced my buddy to leave the bottle with me (a couple of stiff ECBP pours for him I am sure helped ease his fight!) Now after several more pours of this bottle I feel like its a good time to review it. On to the tasting notes:
The entry is more peat forward than the 16 and has a little bit more edge to it. Smoked meat and grilled fruits are also in play here. As we move to the mid palette the smoke is still pronounced but now we add raisins and a bit of barrel spice to the fun. The finish is long with smoke again leading the way and a lovely citrus peel note. A lingering candied fruit note also lingers. It's a well constructed and well balanced Whisky that I wish would become part of their standard line up. I think it's that good. 
Now let's talk value. In my market this goes for $65 and the 8 and 16 are both priced at $69.99. So for the $5 discount would I buy this over the 16? Probably not, I would honestly just keep both on hand! The 16 is more refined and a little richer on the sweet notes. This is more brash and in your face with the smoke. So depending on the night and mood, I could prefer one over the other. 
It's a great effort but Lagavulin and certainly one I will pick up a back up of before it's gone for good. Cheers all!"

4.25,"Obviously a peaty nose, albeit not aggressive, with a significant marine and mineral component. Bacon and seaweed go hand in hand, along with honey and a delicate spicy note. An unexpected fruity sweetness appears, which over time softens peat, along with caramel. Everything is always very saline and mineral.
The mouth confirms the fruity soul of the distillate, with yellow peach, blueberries, banana, a fruit salad scorched after a vigorous passage on the barbecue where grilled ribs were just cooked. Smoky fleshiness well highlighted, at times exuberant enough to cover the sweet side, which is also underlined by the strong maritime and vegetable component. Pepper and ginger. Also a few crumbs of toasted bread, just because it is young.
Quite long finish, very marine, peppery and ashy.
Young, certainly not very balanced, but perhaps for this reason also funny: a Lagavulin different from the usual, perhaps not excellent but more than enjoyable and cheerfully daredevil."

4.25,"Sweet, smokey peat and sour apricots on the nose, sweet peat and bbq meats on the silky palate, the finish is long and smokey with more sweet peat and sour apricots. Empty glass smells amazing."
1.5,Too peated for me not a fan
4.25,"Smoky, sweet, peppery, bitter chocolate, a hint of propolis, thick mouthfeel, dried tobacco leaves, faint cedar, warm and medium finish. I still prefer the 16y but this is a very enjoyable and different expression of Lagavulin. Expectations were not high considering this GoT edition is a smart marketing tactic. Pleasantly surprised."
4.25,Tremendous!  Smoke in the front then mellows to smoked dried dark fruit and a black and white peppercorn finish.
4.5,"Smooth, smokey"
4.0,"A great Lagavulin - smooth and smoky, some Laphroaig-like medicinal flavors like iodine, plenty of graininess, some wood flavors, and an underlying sweetness."

4.5,"Game of thrones whiskies are known for been ""just ok"" but this one is the exception for every rule. This, as most Lagavulin whiskies, is awesome. It is even better than the ""not so limited edition"" Lagavulin 8yo. It is also one of the two GOT whiskies that discloses an age statement. 

Bottled at 46%, this is one great whisky.

On the nose: Mango. Rubber. English sauce, tropical fruits. Pineapple and plastic. Nicely peated.

On the palate is wonderful. It is a dish of a great meat, with salt and pepper and some side oranges. There is not a more accurate description for it. Aftertaste is also great. Peppery, super pleasant.

Definitively buying one for my collection, this dram is a solid 94 over 100, a young but delicious Lagavulin that can easily be an alternative to the classic 16yo. Sláinte!"

4.25,Lagavulin with fruity notes
4.25,"This is a decent release. Even the worst Lagavulin is still pretty good, and I’m sure this is far from the worst Lagavulin has to offer. As a 9 year scotch, it has a little less of a robust flavor than the 16 year variety. That said, the excellent Lagavulin flavor is still present. It’s very smoky on the nose, and that carries to the palate. The shorter aging period makes for a smooth finish, comparatively quick to many other Islay malts."

4.25,Tremendous balance of peat smoke over soft herbal notes. Nice oil coat on the tongue followed by a warm white pepper finish.  The finish doesn’t linger as much as it slowly  fades from memory. Leaving you lovingly reaching back for another dram.  *Given the rising price of Lagavulin 16 (thanks Ron Swanson) this is my preferred & available Islay for the money.

4.0,"Strong peat smoke and rubber makes me feel like I just walked into a Harbor Freight.  Then its followed up with over ripe banana and berries. I didn’t know Harbor Freight sold fruit!  The peat hits you first as you taste, followed by spices and alcohol showing your sinus whose the boss. Tannin dryness bites the back of your tongue. Its complex and a little rough. Just like you like it. Thats what she said."
