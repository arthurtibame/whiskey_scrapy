2.0,"Nose has more vanilla than the 12. Less spice. Oily. 
Taste has a little bite at first. Smooth and short finish. Sweet. With water it gets to be a medium finish. 

Tasted at Glen Moray Distillery on 7/22/2016"
2.0,Lots of vanilla on the nose. Little bite at the start then super smooth and somewhat swept through a short to short-medium finish. Water extends it to a med-long finish

3.0,"This one is a hard one to rate. Nothing stands out about it, all the usual bourbon cask culprits - honey etc. It's not particularly complex or interesting but everything is in harmony. I'd say 3.5. It's very cheap here $60USD. Now the rounding part VFM says 4 but it's just not that level so sadly down to 3 it goes."

4.25,Love the right amount of smoke. Fruity finish. Smooth complex flavors well balanced. A great sipper.
4.0,Very nicely fronted with a smooth finish. Shame this has no number yet.
4.25,"I liked the slight peat smoked flavor and vanilla, caramel finish. I found it smooth and sipping enjoyable."
