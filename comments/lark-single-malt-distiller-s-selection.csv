5.0,"The 2019 edition has quite a sweet fruity nose. Initially described as ""lychee"" but I'm getting more tinned apricots or peaches. Port casks are also noticeable on the nose. 

Taste is quite pleasant. Initially quite smooth but finishes with a bit of a kick.

If you are comparing it to other Distillers editions you would say it is over priced but in my opinion it is worthy he price to have some truely unique from one of Tasmania's best distilleries!"

5.0,Caramel to nose. Spice to start. But peat later. Oil fades to a dry finish.

5.0,"Okay---so we all know that good single malts are now even made outside Scotland.  India (Amrut), France (Brenne----although does that one count as French when Alison lives in the US? ), Japan ( go ahead----choose any between Suntory or Nikka or Hanyu or Karuizawa).   And even Tasmania.  Yes ...Sullivan's Cove won the best whisky award some time back....but honestly....this is by far better.  And unlike Sullivan's French casks, this one is actually attainable.   it's pricy, but you're probably paying a bucket load to the transportation logistics, and less on marketing ( think those fancy Viking stands from Highland Park!)."
4.0,Smooth peaty one of the best
