4.0,"I happen to really enjoy this particular single malt. To me it has a heavier overall presentation in the taste, but the nose well it seemed a little lacking. Tried it with two tablespoons of water and that really opened up the bouquet. 89 to me maybe a malt mark a bit low in my opinion. Really do like this one, but have not tried many others."

3.0,"A good whisky that I think is hurt by a couple factors beyond its control: one, that it's just another of a number of heavily sherried whiskies widely available at this age and price range (Aberlour, GlenDronach, Glenfarclas, etc., etc.,), and two, that it's outhustled by its cheaper, younger sibling, the Glen Garioch Founders' Reserve (a whisky I find much more singular and much more interesting than the 12, though also very different in terms of its flavour profile). Flavour here is a big wave of floral--heather, lavender, dandelion--over a base of pears in syrup. Spicy. Malty. Red berries. More fresh fruit over time. Vanilla, brown sugar, some earthy notes. Add to that some hints of creme brulee and nuttiness on the taste. Nice stuff, but not something I find myself returning to frequently."

4.0,"Not a bad whisky, though quite boring and underwhelming (and who really wants that in a scotch). The nose is faintly fruity, with pears and honey making a shy appearance. The body is better structured and balanced, and almost reminds me of a Dalmore 12. The finish is medium-long and decent. Conclusion: if the Glen Garioch 12 was a tune, it would be a lullaby.

UPDATE: I have come to appreciate the chamomile note to this whisky, as well as the way all of the elements mesh together nicely. I'm giving it an additional star and consider this expression a classic malt that should be a staple to every serious bar."

3.0,"After 3-4 drams of scotch, try saying ""Glen Gee-ree"" a few times.   Would make a spectacular YouTube video.  Anyway, on to the business on hand...so, I'm not sure I liked this one, but I'm not sure I didn't dislike it either.  It's already faded, seemed fleeting.  Like driving down the highway, and watching another Honda Accord, Toyota Corolla, or Nissan Altima come by.  It's reliable, will get you from A to B without any issues, and is trustworthy.  Just not memorable.  Not that all whiskies have to be memorable...there's something about being your day to day steady workhorse.  This is like that.  Flavor profile is more like a Glenfiddich 12 or Glenmo Original.  I would highly recommend this to someone who hasn't had scotch before, it's non-intrusive and gentle.  A good reliable one to have with family and friends over a nice summer day.  Thanks to Scott for this sample...and...Lee/Ryan/Generously Paul/Scott...am I the first to the finish line on round 1?  ( my money was on Lee...I figured he'd be done by week 1 ;-)"

3.0,"Stop number 10 on the SDT is Glen Garioch. There are two acceptable pronunciations from what I've discerned, Glen Gee-ree and Glen Gee-rich (as in Glenfiddich with the soft ch). This Highland single malt comes in at 48% ABV and is non chill filtered. Not sure if there is colorant added but it is a nice amber color in the glass. Matured in a combination of bourbon and sherry casks. 

There is an immediate apricot note one the nose followed by earthy dried fruits like peaches, honey dew and ripe pears. Vanilla and light oak work their way in. Caramel in the background. Light orange citrus and a touch of banana. Maybe some brewed black tea as well. A very nice nosing whisky, but nothing to gush over. 

Wonderful baked cinnamon pears and a hint of overripe banana on the palate. Brown sugar, vanilla and oak show up and make themselves at home. Pepper starts out light but gets stronger the more you hold it on your tongue. 

Moderately oily mouthfeel that is semi dry. Surprisingly long finish that is mostly dry with oak and orange peel. 

Being my first from Glen Garioch I had no expectations going into this review. I was pleasantly surprised by the fruity nose and the pears on the palate.  Very surprised by the length of the finish. It's a nice dram for late spring on a sunny day. Thanks to Scott for the sample. 3.75"

4.0,"It's time for another stop on the SDT.  This sample was generously supplied by Scott from Long Island.  This is the first Glen Garioch (pronounced glen gee ree) whisky I've ever tried, so I have nothing to compare it to.  It's a robust 48% ABV and is non chill filtered.  It's a deep, golden yellow and doesn't produce much leg action in the tasting glass.  A tad oily.

The nose has a unique sweet tea and bread aroma that's livened up with a bit of zesty citrus and young oak.  On the tongue there's a nice cinnamon flavor that fades into a lemony brine that's ultimately very quenching.  The overall finish is medium length, warm with a salted caramel note.  

It's an interesting dram that is a welcome change of pace for me- it's not too sweet, definitely not hot and finishes very well.  I'm not sure what an entire bottle of this runs but I think it adds a nice dimension to any well stocked bar.  Dangerously crushable, even at 48%.  3.75 stars.  Thanks again, Scott.  Cheers."

3.0,"Glen Garioch is one of those often overlooked and does not come readily to mind when seeking out a scotch.  It’s bottled at a lovely, high 48% abv, is non-chilled filtered and aged at least 12 years.  I believe there is coloring added (I would prefer if there was none, but I can live with it).  With all these positives, I expect good things.

The liquid is light amber in color (just a wee bit of artificial color?) A faint and light nose is floral, fruity and nutty.  The aromas of butterscotch, caramelized-bananas, vanilla, sweet tea, honeysuckle, heather, walnuts and almonds can be found.  These aromas do not all come out at once.  It takes time and some digging.  Take time to nose this one as it really sets up the palate (and the high ABV needs to dissipate somewhat).  The first sip is sweet and hot, as expected, in a medium-thin body.  A fair amount of burn, which comes from the alcohol, comes on gradually and crescendos and dissipates in a quick finale.  Tea tasting similar to Barry’s Irish Breakfast Tea and white pepper are the primary flavors.  Brown sugar, vanilla provide a lovely sweetness balanced by drying oak tannins.  The body is short-lived, unfortunately.  The palate experience, starts with a sip, right to a blast, and almost immediately, to a finish.  However, the finish is fairly long of orange-bitters, tea and honey, salted-caramel and woody-oakiness.  A touch of water does enhance the experience that softens the bite and bitterness and is recommended if you want this to be a sweeter dram.

This is a lovely, sweet whisky that only sweetens the longer it opens.  Perfect as an after meal sipper or sitting on a deck during the evening, ending a relaxing day.  Some may find this a simple whisky, bordering on the plain and boring side.  Glen Garioch, in my opinion, is producing whiskies that are not trying to be something that they are not.  It’s a nice, sweet, well-crafted whisky that is flat out enjoyable.  [Dry Glass: Salted Caramel][$57][87/100][Tasted: 2/26/17]"

48% abv
 Color added

Nose: deep and rich, with dark fruit dominating. Also vanilla, honey, some spice including cinnamon and clove

Taste: thick and viscous. Sweet barely sugar and heather on the arrival, which quickly develops into syrupy dark fruits, chocolate, vanilla, toffee/crepe brûlée, maple, light molasses.

Finish: long. Dark coffee and dark chocolate. Fruit notes like raisin, apricot and plum. A hint of oak and nuttiness note lingers at the end.

Value: $50-60 bucks USD. Worth it.

Final thoughts: if you didn’t know it, you’d think this was a 15 or even 18 year old. It’s intense, sweet, creamy and freaking delicious. A near perfect dram for after a meal, this is one of the best 12 year old single malts money can buy.

Score: 4/5 highly recommend buying a bottle.

4.25,"This is a tough nut to crack. The nose is very closed off at first and difficult to suss out anything in particular. Water definitely helps open things up a bit and brings out the sherry and honey. The first thing you find on your palette is the notes from the bourbon and sherry casks in almost perfect unison. Neither takes center stage really. However, after a moment or two the bourbon and sherry turns into a bitter and somewhat tannic note. I’ve read some folks mention a brininess to this malt but I’m not getting that. I get an almost damp earth flavor on the finish with none of the upfront bourbon and sherry sweetness. It’s an intriguing malt for certain and I have to say I appreciate the challenge this is posing. No way would I recommend this to a scotch newbie but for an experienced taster this has something to offer. I’m going to leave this rating-less for the moment. I’m really curious how this changes once it’s been open for a bit. If I had to compare this to anything I’d say it’s almost a bastard child of Bunnahabhain and Craigellachie. Looking forward to seeing where this goes."
