1.0,"Though I tend to favor peated single malts, this one swiftly dashed my high hopes.  The dram initially tasted of bogwater, though time and additional water did improve things a bit.  I think Ryan's review to be unduly generous, but perhaps others' personal tastes are more in line with his.  I'd simply suggest sampling before purchasing."

3.0,"Irish whiskeys are pretty, unassuming characters, subtle and calm in temperment. This whiskey has a light touch with carmel and oak flavors on the front.  This gives way to the peat and smoke.  

The smoke rolls in rather abruptly and wipes clean any lingering sweetness and ushers in a acrid feeling as it evaporates off your tongue.  It's neither pleasant or unpleasant, it just calls for attention in a way you wish it would not. But not for the rapid transition, i think it would be easy to miss the peat flavors that bridge these two distinct tasting portions.

There's a moment where it becomes this lush, green flavor - like what one would expect the entire Irish countryside to taste like if you could distill a few square miles.  It's an unexpected note that carries you between sweet and smokey. It takes the whiskey from unassuming, to knowing; which makes the wiskey a pleasant dram with a little secret that the two of you share."

4.0,"[03.26.2016] My in-laws brought this back from Ireland last week and pulled it out to celebrate my dissertation submission. Excellent choice as Winter wanes into Spring because that's sort of how this bottle tastes as well. 
  
  If you like Jameson and peat, it's safe to say you'll be game for Connemara. Peat smoke is strong on the nose and first sip, but mellows as you continue through the glass, revealing the subtleties you might expect from an Irish whiskey. Light floral tones underscore a sweet and salty, malty body that is followed with a charred and spicy finish. Solid whiskey that probably got the shaft in the Distiller review by being mixed among such an assortment of Irish whiskeys and a slightly elevated (and maybe too high) price compared to others in the market. I'd certainly drink an Ardbeg 12 for the money, but the traditional peat elevates this whiskey."

3.0,"Going green for St Paddy's Day!  Nose is predominately peat, but not like us Islay fans recognize it; here it's earthen and dirty, closer to a 5-year old compost pile than a 1000-year old peat bog.  A little time in the glass and it's possible to find some salt-spray and honeysuckle, with just the faintest whiff of something metallic, as though you're nosing from a raw tin cup.  And while all that may sound possibly objectionable, it's not terribly so.  It does however, set you up honestly for the palate.  Smoke leads the way, but a brief pause on the tongue gives just a bit of sweetness before the vegetals take over and lead to a muddled, salty, dirty finish that has no discernible end, leaving a rubber-smoke taste that lingers for several minutes.  While this isn't resigned to strictly Irish Coffee drinks (which it makes phenomenally well!) it's also not going to be high on my list of recommended malts.  Having had three different Connemara offerings, (12yr, Cask Strength and this Peated Single Malt) I can say that they share a very strong family resemblance, and also that this will be my last.  For the price, there are just too many other Irish (and Scotch) offerings that suit my palate and desired flavor profile.
    Put to music, this would be London Calling by The Clash.  It's memorable because it does something repetitively different than most others; you're just not sure that you like the path it's taken."

4.0,"Connemara stacks up well against its cousins in Islay and does its home country credit.  Connemara's peat flavors are reminiscent of a blend of Port Charlotte and Laphroaig:  slightly fishy, seaweed-like, vegetal peat, with a good dose of minerality to boot.  Those flavors dominate the nose and palate, although there's also some mild malt sweetness at its core.  The finish is unique — my best analogy would be to play dough or rubber, which sounds strange, but is actually not unpleasant.  This is an unabashed, unapologetic peated whiskey, and I very much enjoyed it."

2.0,"My daughter bought me this one as part of the ‘Peated Malt Distinction’ gift pack. Being my first Irish whisky I was rather curious. The nose was rather flat, but there was definitely some smoke. The flatness also appeared in the palate, but besides smoke there were hints of oak, vanilla, and while I don’t find this in other reviews, I tasted herbs, and definitely licorice. While not unpleasant, the herbs and licorice were a bit too dominant for me. Somehow, it made me think of a mediate Speyside dram, with some added Jägermeister."

4.0,"This was not the first time I tried Connemara and I recalled eat as very – well – “non-Irish”. The shortest description of Connemara would be “Add peat to smooth Irish whiskey”. In terms of peat it is not even close to Laphroaig or Ardbeg, but the peat and smoke accents are very well composed with the smooth and sweet character of Irish whiskey. It is truly one of it’s kind but on the hand I wonder who is it for – peat lovers or Irish whiskey fans?"

3.5,"Received this as a house gift at our annual Christmas party of family and friends. We opened it on the spot and I found it to be quite pleasant with a good hint of a bourbon-barrel Islay and not your typical Irish single malt. I only managed a single pour that day and was surprised to see our company had almost polished off the entire bottle, while ignoring much of the expensive stuff. Fortunately, though, a few drams were left to give it a fair shakedown. My views are very consistent with @The_Rev and @Dreaming-of-Islay. The nose is a wonderful combination of mild smoke, malted barley, and a vegetal seaside peat bog. Laphroaig immediately comes to mind but with much less intensity in terms of smoke, medicinal notes, citrus, and brine. At 40% ABV, it hits the palate light and smooth and goes down with the honeyed vanilla ease of a speyside versus a thicker textured pot still. Very drinkable, it’s easy to see why most people would gravitate towards this, but much too loose and watery for my tastes. Would liked to have tried the cask strength version, but doubt I would spring for it. A solid 3.5 stars."

The peat presence on the nose and palate is more subtle than most Islay pours. It leans more to the rubber and iodine end of the spectrum rather than charcoal and bacon. There aren't a lot of other flavors that assert themselves after peat, beyond a light honey sweetness. I can't say I'd opt for this over ardbeg or laphroiag, but it's an enjoyable peaty whiskey for the modest cost."

3.0,"Irish whiskey and peat - do these two go together? Connemara's peatiness has its own style, which is distinctly different from Islay's peat bombs: it is more herbal, restrained and well-integrated. Light and floral on the nose, there is a mix of heather honey, citrus and whiffs of smoke. On the palate, the clean and peppery arrival is followed by an aromatic kick of lemon zest, bitter tea and hints of salt. The peat smoke returns in the finish, lingering on the tongue. Although slightly uneventful and simple, this malt offers a nice variation from the 'Irish theme'.

RATING: 3.0/5.0 stars ≙ 80 pts → AVERAGE"
4.0,"Nose:
Burre-brune, almost burnt tea biscuit     
Taste:
Burre-Brune sauce with light earthy cocoa undertones. Very much like a lightly peated single malt, but instead of the deep malt flavor of a scotch, there’s that light and estery, polite Irish whiskey character (think, Chardonnay).  No meat, no ash, no smoke, BUT the peat is definitely noticeable in the earthy cocoa-esque and “burnt sugar cookie” flavors. 
Body:
It’s an Irish whiskey, nearly effervescent, but without any stinging heat. And yes, there’s a smooth quality to it, without it getting syrupy or thick. It’s just short of being creamy, but the feel is pleasing, and makes sense with the restrained, yet “deep enough” profile. 
Finish:
Light and lemony, almost coriander like with a calcium salt pucker, very similar to a colder-climate dry white wine, like my favorite Pouilly-Fuisse."

Taste: Smoke, rye notes from the bourbon barrels hit the tip of my tongue, some of the honey notes hit, and near the finish I get a sweet note accented by smoke

Finish: I’m guessing from the bourbon barrels, I get an initially spicy finish, with smoke and sweetness that sticks with me for a bit.

The nose, while not particularly smoky, has the a certain commonality with an Islay dram (my mind goes to Laphroaig) - sweet vanilla, brine, olive, a certain vegetal quality. The palate doesn't put much smoke on display, but that briny, seabreezy, iodine-y, band-aidy peat quality is front and center, with a bright, sweet vanilla at the core. The finish is lightly drying, with (finally) a hint of smoke. I sure hope this is the rule, not the exception, for the entry level Connemara, because if it is, they've stepped up their game in some exciting ways."

Palate:  Grassy fresh.  Cooling herbs, subtle mint.  A smokiness that isn't overpowering, like the wisps of white smoke when you first light a fire.  Light heather honey. Slight oak and spice, some white peppercorns.

Finish:  Cooling finish with rounded earth and smoke.  Some more peppercorns slowly fade into savory peat.

Conclusion:  Herbs galore! All those wonderful cooling herbs that remind me of a cold, wet Irish morning that I miss so much.  The peat is definitely not the overpowering ""I'm a tough man so I only drink heavily-peated Islays"" type of peat.  It's got a lot more subtleties and layers than a lot of the peaty notes in other whiskies, and ""smoky"" is not what I'd use to describe it.  There's far less sweetness than I remember, though it's been probably 4 years since I had this last.  I do wish that Kilbeggan would have bottled this at maybe 43% ABV, though there's a surprising amount of complexity in here for a 40% ABV NAS whiskey."

3.5,"Irish double distilled, peated whiskey.
Ticks a lot of boxes in complexity, but nothing seems to stand out or wow me.
Light bodied for a double, not classic Irish triple distillation. Not heavy on the bourbon casks, which is surprising considering the colour, which leaves me to believe colouring is added. The peat is nice and gentle followed by a silky Honeysuckle and Apple Crumble sweetness.
If you can't decide between an Islay or a Lowland Scotch, this meets them dead in the middle."

Finish: first spices and smoke are dominant, then smokiness remains a bit longer, after a while gentle sweetness remains. Wonderful, not too heavily peated although, so can be ideal for people who want some challenge but not heavy peat fans."

Palate arrives mildly sweet, herbal, peaty, honeyed, vanilla, shortbread. Reminds me of a less-smoky Ardmore. Gentle, sweet, and peaty. Finish is long: vanilla wafers, smoke, and earth. I like this a lot, and I typically don’t like Irish whiskey. There is no pure pot still taste in this. Could drink this regularly."

Did I detect a homely touch of apple crumble?

Not predictable but not a game changer, I will have this again just for the craic."

2.0,Inherited an open bottle of this. Not sure if it’s old or bad or both. Tastes like somebody made a thin version of Jamo and tried to add more flavor by smoking it.
3.75,"Nose: Musty pot still funk.  Fruity - bananas, apples.  Cheerios.  Nuts - walnuts, cashews, peanuts.  Cream.  Floral perfume.  Salt.  Nutmeg.  Peat, earth, wisps of smoke.  Super wild combination of things going on here.  Totally unfocused but in a really interesting way.

Palate: Earthy peat, smoke.  Cream.  Bananas, mangoes, apples.  Walnuts.  Cream, especially on the finish.  Effervescent green apple thing at the tail end.  Musty pot still funk throughout - leans in the direction of Balcones Pot Still Bourbon.  Slight brine thing going on.

Other notes: This stuff is weird in the best way possible.  All over the place on the nose.  Palate is a little more focused, but still wild.  It's like if Green Spot and Laphroaig had an illegitimate child.  Not everybody's cup of tea, but a really solid addition to my collection."

3.25,"A peated Irish whiskey is not something you get to try every day. Actually i was looking for a long time to taste a Connemara, and the result was kind of dissapointing.

On the nose is gorgeous. Perfect score. A perfumed, lovely peat; marshmellows, burnt hay and starfruit. Quite an experience. 

But then, it just falls apart. 

On the palate it is very ""watery"". Some pepper and very little peat. All those great aroma notes are lost in the palate. Aftertaste is medium short with a slight peatiness. Move along, nothing to see here. 

Overall i give this dram a 67 over 100 and most of the points were obtained on the nose part. :("

3.5,"Being someone into peaty scotch, I was very curious to try this Irish Peated Single Malt, and I am happy to say that it is not just another scotch and has its own character. 

The nose is brine, salt, smoke, a little bit of the bandaid, overall is very pleasing.

The palate is very much Irish whiskey, pears, biscuit, a bit of vanilla. I actually not feeling the peat or smoke on the palate.

The finish is where the peat opens up, it's pleasant and medium to long. There is also some cocoa and honey. 

Nice whiskey that stands out from competition with its Irish character and at 49.50 CAD is a steal."

3.0,"Peated, goes well with a trabuc on a irish rainy day st firelace."
4.25,"Not your typical Oirish piece of business, lad. Nose is tobacco smoke, dusty charcoal, with a more mossy, muddy peat. The smoke itself is minimal, save a touch of tobacco leaf. A lemon meringue or custard hits the back of the nose in a big way. A little bit of metallic / penny / 9v battery. 

The taste is more mossy; the peat is not your classic smoked stuff, but it definitely is in the mix. More lemon, but in the taste it is lemon Pledge. Just a touch of sawdust. 

The finish is cut tobacco, charcoal, a tinge of plastic. There is a finished wood aspect that dovetails nicely with the lemon Pledge. Some more metallic battery-lickin goodness."
4.0,"I’m liking this one. On the nose, I’d think for sure it was an Islay with some sweet fruit notes and salty. When tasting it, though, I feel like it’s more savory. Almost a meat savoryness, with a very rounded profile. A little honey and biscuit on the finish."

3.0,"I’ve had a vary hard time locating a bottle of this in Texas. After finding it at my favorite local whisky bar, I’m ok with not buying a full bottle. That being said, it’s still a quality pour, just a little too one note to justify dropping $50 for a full bottle. 

The nose (as expected) is full of peaty glory. Not the briny, coastal type you’d see from Ardbeg or Talisker, but a warmer, more floral type of peat. Similar to the peated Balvenie. A lovely nose! 

Unfortunately, the taste doesn’t keep up with the nose. I felt like this malt was a one trick pony. The palate is pleasant enough, with the expected smooth and buttery Irish taste,but lacks depth. The finish is disappointingly short. It almost feels like they peated the malt to cover up the thin taste. 

As far as Irish single malts go, there are far better options, such as Knappogue Castle, Teeling, or even Bushmills. I’ll tack on an extra .5 for the lovely peated nose, but this dram did t quite live up to expectations."
