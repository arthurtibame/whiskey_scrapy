Body: smooth, slightly dry and a shade on the watery side
Palate: vanilla, banana, caramel, woody, hints of grape and cognac. A bit like brandy
Finish: woody but not lingering, somewhat rounded

Overall, subtle but not mind blowing. Solid dram."

3.0,"Very thin all over from the mouth feel, to the nose.  Grasses, hay, roses, strawberries, mint and white grapes were the notes.  The palate had a nice, but too quick, sweetness from light fruits, sugarcane, vanilla, and butter.  However, then it exploded into both a white and black pepper collision.  The spicy, short, and dry finish might entice some, but this one to me is just so-so.  2.75.  Thanks for the try on this one @Scott_E!  The theme of this dram needs to also have an explosive ending. “Sheer Heart Attack” by Queen will do."
3.0,"It’s time for another distillery tour sample, this one provided by my friend @Scott_E: Miltonduff 10 year old.  This Speyside distillery was founded in 1824 and has been steadily used in Ballentine’s blends.  They only have 2 official bottling’s- a 10 and a 12yo.  They also bottled under the name Mosstowie for a little while.  Those particular bottles were filled using malt made from a Lomond-style still.  Basically, it’s a still with adjustable plates inside and a moveable lyne arm, and can be used to make heavier spirits.  

This bottle is from Gordon & MacPhail and is bottled at 43%.  It’s champagne gold, oily and makes no legs in the Glencairn.

The nose has light florals and grassy notes with some weak, oak undertones.  There’s faint sherry and buttery aspects, but something makes this seem more like a weak bourbon.  More sherry notes show up if you give it time.

The palate is sweet vanilla, honey nut cereal and light sherry.  There’s a harsh, wood bite at mid sip and that kind of messes with the entire profile to the point it starts going downhill.  It has a thick and oily mouthfeel that lingers on and on.

The finish is long, really long, with a sweet sherry note and building warmth.  The odd oak astringency is the only thing keeping this from being a big hit with me.  It’s just too rough around the edges.

Overall, at $55 it’s a great deal, it just lacks some much needed smoothness.  There’s some depth (plenty for a 10yo), complexity and flavor, but that harshness needs to be pulled from this to make it better.  Perhaps some water would work wonders here, but I don’t have the time or volume of whisky to work that out.  As it is, it’s a 3.25 star dram that could be higher if the few kinks could be worked out.  Cheers."
3.0,"After being out for a bit on Friday, I flip on the tube to watch the Mets-Yankees opener (Mets won, yay!). Poured the G&M Miltonduff that is bottled at 43%. 

A light opening of hay and dry grass, wet sawdust (pinewood). Some light sherry notes are way in the background. Also found are walnuts and, almost out of place, white wine notes (Chardonnay or Pinot Grigio) and becomes more pear-ish with some vanilla. 

The initial draw on the palate is fruity and spicy.  Pears in cocktail juice (think Dole’s canned Peaches) with oak and white pepper. A thin line of sweetness containing vanilla, caramel and butterscotch.  Orange rind begins at the back of the palate towards to finish. The body is medium-light in weight. 

The finish is bitter of orange zest and lemons. An oaky dryness that keeps the palate dry for a good and long period of time. 

This is a dram that, in a single word, could be described as ordinary.  It’s youthfulness is apparent in the spiciness and thin on flavors.  A dram worthy in social situations that doesn’t require concentration or time.  However, for the price, and in the same social situation, I would probably prefer a Glenlivet. [$55][84/100][Tasted: 7/20/18]"
2.0,"After 3 attempts on mobile...giving this one more shot through the iPad.  Not sure I’m a fan of these new updates...but it’s free, sans ads, and I might be okay with that.  Till I’m not.  Anyway...this is the first one out of the gate on our final round of this distillery tour.  Courtesy of @Scott_E.  After reading @Generously_Paul “s review, I totally agree.  It’s really not worth the money, far from it.  Weak...almost an apple juice with a touch of barley.  Keep it as a blend to mix with whatever the kids mix it with nowadays."
2.0,"Stop number 97 on the SDT is Miltonduff. A little known Speyside distillery with a huge capacity of 5.5 million liters per year, second only to Glenlivet. The vast majority of their whisky goes into Ballentines blends but they did release a 10 and 12 year old official bottling, which from what I could find was a number of years ago. These days they have a kind of partnership with Gordon and MacPhail to release a semi official 10 and 15 year old. 

This 10 year old is bottled at 43% ABV (which I believe was done for the US market because all information I could find about this bottle showed it as 40% [including this entry on Distiller but it’s close enough to not warrant making a new entry], even on the G&M website). It is likely natural color of golden straw and it is chill filtered. Matured in a combination of refill and first fill sherry casks. 

The nose starts floral with fresh hay and grasses. Funny that it’s sherry matured because I’m getting a distinct bourbon sensation. Light oak, pine resin and vegetal like celery. After time the sherry notes do start to come through. Light raisins, plums and red apples. A light but well integrated buttery toffee and caramel with vanilla. 

The palate...well, there wasn’t much there to get excited about. Slightly bitter oak and a very generic whisky taste, probably why it’s so popular with blenders as a base component. Sharp at times with a faint metallic note. Possibly some tobacco but I can’t say for sure. Malty with a bit of honey. Some peppery heat even at 43%. Like the nose, I get more of a bourbon feel than a sherry one. Maybe I’m just off tonight. 

A medium light bodied mouthfeel that is thin but lightly oily. 
A medium length finish that is mostly just pepper and oak. 

Another poor example of an independent bottling (even though this is supposedly approved by the distillery). The nose was ok but the palate was nearly impossible to dissect and it was very uninspired. Not impressed. At $55 for a 10 year old the price is just ok, but the value isn’t there. Thanks to @Scott_E for the sample. 2.5 and a hope that the rest of the final round goes better.
Cheers"
3.0,"A weak whisky that lacks a nose, though it has a redeemable palate with notes of cooked apples. It's... kinda nice in its blandness. 

It's easy drinking."

Tasted on a warm evening in Tenerife after a dram of the Glenlivet distillers reserve. This is a lovely sherried scotch with raisins and old wood on the nose. Hope to enjoy it more."
