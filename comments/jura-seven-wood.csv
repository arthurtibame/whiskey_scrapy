2.75,"The concept here could have come from the Gillette marketing book - if you thought three barrels were good, wait until you try seven. It’s hard to know if there was any method to this madness, but the result is perfectly quaffable if unremarkable. It’s a little sweeter than the 10 and not as good in my book, though my fellow drinkers thought this one had more complexity."
3.5,Slight smokiness.  Can taste the oak.  Short finish.

3.0,"So I've been meaning to write up a review on this for a little while but have put it off. Circumstances have forced my hand as a friend left an excellent bottle of RUA from @gwrdistilling and took this bottle in return.
Jura Distillery is located on the Island of Jura. Fun fact, George Orwell wrote the novel ""1984"" while staying there.
I purchased the bottle when it first came out as I was fairly new to whisky and was intrigued on the premise of seven different types of oak barrels being used in maturation.
I've never heard of Jura before and went on their website, which looked a lot different then it does now. I distinctly remember the website implying that the distillery was owned and operated by the small community residing on the island.
The truth is that the current distillery was rebuilt in 1963 by the island's owners as a way to stop further decline in population of the island. The distillery has been owned by Whyte and Mackay Group since 1995, which was acquired by Emperador Distillers Inc. in 2014. The distillery is pretty much the only source of work for those who live on the Island of Jura.
On the nose there's some citrus and baked apple notes with touch of cinnamon. On the palate it starts out sweet like honey and candied apple, slight nuttiness then there's a bit of citrus and ginger notes with black pepper spice followed by bitterness and slightly metallic finish.
It's interesting to nurse this and almost taste the influence of the different types of oaks, however, there's nothing that really ends up happening. It feels like this was rushed and not enough time given in European oaks. Interesting premise that is flawed in execution. It's not bad, but I had much higher expectations for this. Maybe future releases will show improvement."

2.0,"So my kid has this video soccer game where he can do tricky dribbles and moves, and through sheer acrobatics, score a goal like Ronaldo and Messi combined.  But when I take him to his weekly soccer matches ( back when we were allowed out—-remember those days?), he’d do a dribble or two, and end up losing the ball.  And I gently try to explain to him after the match “ get solid on the fundamentals before you start doing fancier moves”.   He’s super good in math, two grades over his level...so, it’s cool that he can’t dribble,,,he’ll be fine.  

I’d have the same unsolicited piece of advice for Jura.  Before you go tricking with 7 wood finishes, just try to get one right.  This here was a sample I opened up, hoping the 7 woods would add exponentially to complexity and depth.  More like accelerated downward logarithm.  As time passed, just got worse.  Weak nose of shortbread cookies, and tastes of chocolate and bakery sweets.  

On the brightside:  Jura still remains as the one distillery that I’ve yet to like any of their products, and they’ve kept that trend with this one, for me at least."
