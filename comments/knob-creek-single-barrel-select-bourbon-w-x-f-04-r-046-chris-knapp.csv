4.0,"Very solid. Bottle started out too hot for my taste with an onslaught of oak and wood flavors, but as the bottle went on it improved drastically. Very smooth and interesting smoky profile towards the end. Great bourbon."
3.5,"Filmy mouthfeel. You can taste the oak before an intense, but quick, finish."

4.25,"60% or bust!

For real though, you can’t beat 14-15 year Knob single barrel store picks still readily available for under $50"
4.25,Great bang for your buck!

4.5,"Surprisingly amazing, great legs, long lasting, great rich flavors."
4.25,"Nose - Spice forward with some cherry and caramalized sugar
Taste - First thing you notice is the spice, then vanilla, cherry, and caramel come through
Finish - lingering oak spice, and light sweetness"

4.25,"Deep, cherry pepper. Like a doctor pepper bourbon. Smells like a higher rye but not a strong rye flavor"

5.0,"Got this at total wine, amazing bourbon for the price.  Rich flavors of caramel, oak and leather.  With ice you get some of that Jim beam peanut funk that I love.  I would rate this higher than many $100+ bottles.  Good pick Me. Knapp!Amazing value."

4.5,Missouri pick 2/26/04 -6/25/19. These KC sib picks are an amazing bargain.
4.25,"Actually 9.5 year select. Very rich and dark, sweet"
4.0,"120 proof. Joes bottle shop. 15ish years

Smooth and oaky with some cherry notes. Good solid finish, KC always a good choice."
4.25,Worth it at regular price but at 42.99 this is this is some crazy value.
4.75,"Neat. Neck pour. Gallenstein #22 15.3 years old. I was not expecting a cherry bomb from a knob creek.  Amazing blend of oak and cherry.  Creamy vanilla.  Baking spices.  I want to describe the scent as a cherry cheesecake.  Quite impressed.

Texture is very syrupy.  All dark and brown sugar on the tongue.  Gives way to that intense cherry bomb and vanilla again.  Legs are all oak.  Slight hint of the nuttiness but it is really in the background.

This might be the best Knob Creek store pick I have had yet.  So impressive at only $55 too."

4.0,"Wow...this packs a punch.  I picked up a store selection ( Adelphia Wine out of NJ), for $50.  I figured one can’t go wrong at that price.  It’s almost 15 years old ( barreled 10/2004 and bottled 8/2019), single barrel, from warehouse 1, floor 6 of 8, and rack 1.  120 proof.  I had to add ice and let it sit for a while, sipping slowly while watching Narcos on Netflix.  

Thick and viscous, with a burnt orange color.  
I can nose this all day: cherries and burnt sugar.  
Taste is reminiscent of ECBP...orange rinds and sugar.  

It’s a slow sipping bourbon, meant to enjoy that one ounce with ice over a span of an hour.  At $50, won’t break the bank, and on par with a ECBP or Stagg Jr."

Floor: F-05 // Rick: R-046
Selected: 9/4/2019
By: Frugal MacDoogals, Nashville, TN

Amazing flavor for 120 proof, sits on the tongue well, slides down easy, with a warmth that tickles yer toes.
Very mild bouquet for a bourbon.
I could really get used to drinking this, gonna be hard going back to 80 proof!"

4.5,"“Fisch in a Barrel #2”. Best damn deal on the shelf. 15yr single barrel for $43! Nose is toasted oak, heavy cherry, vanilla and caramel. Major cherry bomb with a looong spicy rye finish. Nice Thick mouthfeel with relatively little alcohol burn considering the proof. Excellent"
4.0,"Nose - sweet and fruity. Very mild nose. Water releases a little bit of maple sweetness. 
Palate - very nice oak and char tastes. Little bit of fruit. Hint of corn. Very rich. Medium spice. 
Finish - nice easy finish. Pretty smooth. Barrel notes and a little chocolate. Nice mouthfeel that tingles the tongue."
