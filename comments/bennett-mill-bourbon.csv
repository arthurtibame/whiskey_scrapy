3.0,"Taste- 1.5 oz Neat in Glen Cairn glass

Nose: (2.75)  Lots of candy-corn sweetness. I get some buttered corn, and Cracker-jack.  It is welcoming but maybe a bit too much.  I do also get a bit of solvent that is slightly off putting.

Palate:(3.0)  Reminds me of corn pudding.  There is some brown sugar in there.  Towards the back palate it is creamy and has a thicker viscosity.  A bit oily but coats well.

Finish: (3.25)  I get a nice cola finish with a little spice on the back end.  Would have like this spice earlier on to bring some balance with the sweet.

Overall:  I have mixed emotions.  On the upside--This reminds me alot of Rowan's Creek which I like.  I applaud these guys for using their own distillate, own aging, using local Illinois grains, and just doing their own thing.  They could have just as easily bottled an MGP, made up a cool story, slapped a label on it, and called it a day like a lot of start-ups are doing.  

On the downside-  this is young and a bit too sweet.  It needs some spice to balance things out.  A little bit ""mashy"" to me.  I hope these guys continue to develop their craft and I will stop in to see their operation as Geneva is close by."
4.5,A well crafted Bourbon. Great finish with a hint of spice. Perfect just the way it is or with a little splash of water to open it up.
3.75,Great nose of caramel and oak. Thinking a high corn mash bill. Palate is sweet and lots of caramel overtones. Finish is very light burn followed by more caramel and oak. Really well done.
