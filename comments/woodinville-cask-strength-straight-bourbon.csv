4.0,"The smell, like with most bourbons, is full of vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg with a slight note of fresh bread. The taste is buttery and has a strong taste of baked apples and pastry. Despite being 127 proof, it is surprisingly light. I would overall compare the taste to a hot, fresh apple fritter."
4.25,"On the nose, this reminds me a lot of Colonel E.H. Taylor Single Barrel: loads of vanilla, caramel and some cherry. The whiskey arrives with a fair amount of heat (not surprising, given the proof) and cinnamon spice. This is pretty complex given the relatively young age (~5 yrs). The mid-palate is nice and chewy, with Vanilla Cherry Coke and a slightly bitter spearment to balance the sweet. The finish is long, with bitter dark chocolate lingering along with more cinnamon and nutmeg."

3.75,This is hot with a long finish. It has a nice cherry apple nose with surprisingly little ethanol. It reminds me a little of Stagg Jr with some sharper edges and a longer hot finish. It is good. My bottle was a single barrel selection from High Times.
3.0,Good bourbon.

4.25,"Phenomenal cask strength bourbon! This is everything right about the craft bourbon industry. I toured the distillery this summer and got the chance to be part of a private barrel selection. These guys are taking every effort to produce a world class whiskey. Seasoned barrel staves, toasted heads, single sourced corn from a local farm. All that effort results in a burst of cinnamon and baked spices on the palate led by the warm vanilla nose. The oak is the star of the finish that lingers on and on. Kentucky meet Washington!"
