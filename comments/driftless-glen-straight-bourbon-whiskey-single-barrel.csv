1.0,Strong grass taste for me. I’ve had one pour and doubt I’ll return to the bottle. Just not for me. Every sip was like  eating grass

3.75,"Vanilla, spicy, light honey, and a little oak. Purchased at the distillery. A young company and whiskey aged only 31 months. Can slightly tell early in aging process but tastes better than age would suggest. Proofing to 96 helped keep tasting notes from a young whiskey. Excited to see what the future holds with further aged bourbons. Well worth a try."

3.75,"I really like this. Nice rich, well rounded flavor. I love the way the caramel works its way in.  Straight bourbon version very good too.  On my 2nd bottle - first was outstanding; 2nd still good."
4.25,"Pleasantly surprised. Had at a sample tasting at Binny’s and liked it a lot. 60% corn mashbill but still has a strong rye presence. Too expensive for an everyday drinker, but was a good bottle (and a good looking one at that) for the price"

3.75,"CBRC pick, “Luke’s Unicorn Dream”,  41 months, barrel 1558, 118.6 proof.

Definitely a heavy hitter, can taste the ethanol but it’s well managed.

Nose has notes of cedar, vanilla, overripe fruits and tea.

Palette is similar but additions of cinnamon and rye heat.

Finish is exactly what you expect of a high proof rye. Long and hot.

A little expensive for this but it’s best use has been as a high proof rye in an old fashioned."

3.25,Great immature bourbon!
3.75,"Really great barrel. Balanced flavor, oak and vanilla with just a touch of heat. Well rounded and balanced. A little oily on the finish. Overall a great bottle"
