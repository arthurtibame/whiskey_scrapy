3.5,"Nose: burnt bacon, sweet maple syrup, blue cheese, mayonnaise, pine wood, sap, cherry, strawberry, 

Taste: ham, espresso grounds, dark chocolate, black pepper. Water brings out the maltiness and a minty lagavulin style mid palette. 

Not as smokey as one would expect from a young islay."

4.0,"This may be my first first-to-taste on this site!  I went to a Glenmorangie event back in January (feels like a lifetime ago, doesn't it?), and they brought along a few Ardbegs to try as under-the-table drams.  The standouts of the night were the Traigh Bhan and the 2019 Supernova, but they also had a sample of their upcoming Wee Beastie.  I got a small pour, so I don't have highly specific tasting notes, but this was a perfectly pleasurable Ardbeg that felt like almost exactly what it is: a younger, punchier Ardbeg 10.  Subtracting five years from the age didn't have a huge negative impact in my recollection, although it amped up the smoke, that Islay medicinal note (reminiscent of a young, 5-year-old peated Bunnahabhain I once picked up in Glasgow), and a wide array of herbaceous or grassy flavors.  This bottle presents a very straightforward, classic peated whisky profile, and I think it's fairly priced at around $40-45.  I'd slightly prefer Lagavulin 8, a close analogue that in rare instances can be found for under $50."

4.0,"Smoke and ocean are there, but not as abruptly and grumpy as the label would suggest: wet peat with barbecue ribs, oranges and lemons, with a sprinkling of pepper. Touch of sweet licorice. Tones from Ardbeg but all in all quiet and simple, we are more on the side of a ladybug than a horsefly...
The palate becomes harsher in the aromas, while flowing oily on the tongue, bringing out the burnt tires sprinkled with black pepper and cloves, with sweet hints that go in the background (candied orange, more licorice, hazelnuts). Very marine, especially in length, with salt permeating the mouth. Quite static, but pleasant, for those who love the genre, of course.
The finish is quite long and ashy, where the tarry blanket drags some licorice, pepper, orange and a lot of salt.
Far from the grumpy little beast evoked by the name, it is a basic but pleasant expression of Ardbeg for those who want to get closer to the notes of the distillery, all too muffled especially if you think of the Ten and how much more representative it is at a similar if not lower cost. If this expression is really here to stay, the price should be reconsidered, although I fear this could lead to an increase of the 10yo (with a relative decrease in production) also to give more breathing space to the production of the distillate."

4.0,"Minute peat but the classic Ardbeg smoke is very present. I still prefer Ardbeg 10 but for the price ($35), this will be staying in my rotation as a solid daily drinker."
3.5,"2nd time tasting: 

Nose - blueberry jam, blue cheese, espresso, chocolate, burnt wood.

Taste: blueberries / dark fruit immediately turns into bacon grease and then disappears. The finish returns with that mint after taste but now it has the edition of a burnt hay. Fairly generic vegetation note as well. Very lingering black pepper finish as well.

Water intensifies the fruit notes as well as the malt. It turns the taste into what I can only describe as motor oil. The flavors definitely evolved from last time but it’s still a 3.5 from me"

3.5,"Gives a new dimension to Ardbeg. Fine dram. Gives a heavy hit just like a scotmans kilt that blows up with the wind, except, this is a good experience."
3.5,A good young Ardbeg. Much better on the palate than on the nose.
4.25,"47.4% abv, Peated and cheap. Best combo ever"
4.0,"This is my first taste of any big single malt scotch. 

The nose gave me maple, citrus, and that medicine smell. 

Taste was pepper heat, citrus, and some cut grass. 

I don’t have anything to compare this to, so more single malt is needed. 

Where do I go from here?"
4.25,null
4.5,"Neat.  Neck pour.  The peat bites at you at first but isn’t aggressive enough to hide the flavors behind it.  Pear and chocolate.  Salted chocolate even.  Hint of pralines.  Bit musty like a forest after morning rain.  Even a hint of oak.  It’s simultaneously sweet and sour.

Super creamy on the palate.  Getting those pears and vanilla on the tongue.  Even some caramel and sugar.  Peat shows up but doesn’t overwhelm again.  Brings with it a chocolate rush accompanied by that brine.  Aftertaste brings back the pear.  Peat lingers in the cheeks and gums.  Gets sweeter and sweeter the more the mouth acclimates to the peat.

I love this new Ardbeg expression.  The price feels a bit weird to me costing the same price as the 10 year but it is also unique enough that I can simply sit back and appreciate it as it’s own experience rather than say it’s a bad value being half the age.  It’s so well balanced and the flavors are so distinct and inviting."
4.75,"Good addition to the Ardbeg line. Light color, like apple juice. Smoke and sugar in the nose. Peat, smoke, plum, and candied fruits on the palate. Quick finish, leaves peat and caramel behind."
4.0,null
4.25,"Great smokey peat flavor , I didn't feel the 5yr age affected it vs a 10yr. I give it a slight bump in rating due to it being less expensive than comparative bottles."
4.0,"Thanks Ryan for this sample. Peaty with a nice sweetness.  Some Short bread aroma.  Taste follows aroma, with buttery smoky goodness."
4.25,"First off, I’m a HUGE Ardbeg fan. This dram is just another reason to be.

Look - beautiful light amber color, like apple juice. Slow thin legs as I expect from an oily scotch like this. They don’t disappoint. 

Nose - the most predominant aroma is that of lightly smoked meats, like a salami or a prosciutto, and it is accompanied by a beautiful, round sweetness like warm chocolate. Something sharp hides just out of sight, maybe a spice of some sort that I can’t identify. Alcohol isn’t overwhelming at around 47% but you can’t discard its presence.

Taste - opens up very softly, not as rash as I would have figured from such a young whisky. Saltiness and the ocean greenery clash suddenly and dominate the tongue, I’ve never had seaweed but this is what I imagine it would taste like. Disappears slowly, fantastic mouth feel - not too thick but not fleeting - then dissipates into something slightly floral.

Overall - a very good purchase. Potentially a good introduction to the bold flavor profile of Ardbeg expressions. Reasonably priced as well! Though I’m from Alabama so anything not from a package store is usually well priced. 

Will definitely ask my local store to keep these on the shelf!"
4.0,"A surprise win for a young Islay scotch.  Huge fan of the whole Ardbeg line and have most in my normal rotation, and Wee Beastie is certainly a welcome addition.

For $45, its a no brainer if you're into big, meaty, peaty whisky.

Sweeter than other other Ardbeg, perhaps thanks to the sherry influence?  

Worth the money, worth a try."

4.25,"Nose is brine; smoke, bbq meat; chocolate, and candy sweetness.

Taste is briney seaweed, peat phenols, smoke, and a sweetness I can’t pick out.

Finish is smoke and salt.

Wonderful expression, I am excited to try this against other heavily peated islay scotches to find the subtleties."
4.0,"Very Smokey, not for everybody. Wood flavor everywhere."
4.0,"Less smoky and more sweet than I would have expected, this is a very impressive demonstration that young whisky can be extremely drinkable. It’s not as complex or as seductive as the 10 — one sip is pretty much the same as another — but it’s a unique twiddle of the Ardbeg flavor profile dials that should appeal to people who want the smoke turned down a notch and the sweetness amped up. It’s leagues better than the An Ao and will make a passable stand-in for the 10, which will in shorter supply until at least 2024 because of poorly timed production cuts following its acquisition by LVMH. Thank you @PBMichiganWolverine for the generous sample."

4.5,This is the best bang for your buck smokey scotch. Buy it now. I’d buy this over most other expressions.
4.25,"This is pretty unruly...I like it! Smoky, dark fruit, minerals and a lot of brine. It’s gonna knock you around a bit, but I like that in an Islay."
3.25,"I saw this reviewed recently on the front page, and the consensus seemed to be that this was ""too potent"" for most. I don't believe I'm out of line when I say I am ready for this Scotch to secure the blindfold and work it's reach on me.

So, knowing that the age is really the only differing factor here versus other Ardbeg products, I figured I wouldn't get much difference on the scent, but really only the taste. However, although the nose does differ with notes of saltwater, honey, and mineral, it's shockingly more ""sticky"" than other Ardbeg offerings. What I mean is, even though I can smell my glass a mile away (which is usual), the scent drifts up my nose and lodges itself into my brain, really securing the peat and changing the way it's ever been perceived.

Going in, the ethanol hits the nose, which delivers more peat backbone before it ever touches the lips. Upon first taste, the saltiness is what's first detected, although it's not stronger than usual, just easier to find. The honey and cereal from usual Ardbeg tastes are still there, but they get drowned out almost immediately by an unrefined ethanol finish.

As I once predicted, it's not that the peat or smoke is any stronger in this version, but that it's simply not mellowed out in the barrel, which seems obvious. It's a nice flavor is have in the bar, especially when comparing it to other Ardbegs or Scotch. Not sure if it could really work in any cocktails, but that's probably not what the Ardbeg fellas ever had in mind. In the end, I certainly feel way more taken by the smoke with this entry, but it's mostly found in the nose and temples than through the palate."

3.75,"Remember as a kid having your first school ground fight?  Usually some bully challenges you, and to save face or impress a girl, you accept an after school brawl?  If you were like me ...top math and science student, but barely topping 100lb and 5’4” as an 8th  grader, your top math or science didn’t suddenly make you a black belt in jujitsu.  So, you’d go in knowing it’ll be bad.  Maybe a black eye.  Maybe a split lip.  But it’ll be just one hit, and once you fall to the ground, it’s over.  Not quite.  You see, the other guy is usually an asshole.  Probably takes his fighting points from watching WWF, not some gentlemanly fight like fencing.  It’s much worse than you expected.  It’s a hard punch to the face, followed by him sitting on you and beating you to a pulp till that cute girl ( the source of all this) pulls him off you.  

Yeah...I felt like that while having this Ardbeg.  I knew a 5 yr Ardbeg will be bruising.  It’ll be young and brash.  But...it’s an Ardbeg, so I’ll like it.  Maybe the first sip will be harsh, but then it’ll be fine.  Nooooo. This Ardbeg is sitting on you, pounding your taste buds till it goes numb.  I never was a masochistic guy, but if I were, this is a drink to have with butt cheek showing leather attire, spiked collars and some madame you’ve hired for $500 to whip you as you’re tied to a pole.  

It’s a brute.  I’m getting brine and smoke aroma, except it’s amped up a lot.  Palette is an onslaught of medicinal peat.  Long finish.  

There’s no two ways about this.  Either you’ll like it (4 + stars) or it’ll be like taking a school yard pounding.  

If anyone wants samples...let me know...not sure I can take more beatings from this guy anymore...

Update June 2020:  I very much stand corrected.  Once the bottle got some air, the oxidation really subdued the heat.  Still not at the level of 10, but much better than their core NAS releases."

4.25,"Nose is spicy red pepper flakes, with black pepper seasoning over a steak from cast iron. Bonfire smoke with just a hint of barrel char. Those nose is a dry smoky peat, and not wet bog. Slightly on the medicinal side of the fence, but more like a campfire in late summer.

Part of the heat in the nose is the ABV of 47% but there is a not insignificant portion of that coming from the peppery aromas. Still, considering how high the ABV is there isn't quite as much burn as I would have expected. Or maybe it's just more pleasant than I would have anticipated.

The taste is jalapeno and habanero heat in the middle of the tongue. Just a hint of menthol/mint at the swallow. The peat manifests itself as more boggy and muddy at the swallow than it does in the nose.

The finish is dry cigar tobacco ash, the finish is not very long but it is very pleasant. It's dry like a bonfire that you just doused water all over. The burn is just this side of being overkill, but I really enjoy it. If you are a peat-head You need to get your hands on some because it's not that expensive."
4.25,SMOKE.

4.25,Big and smokey as you'd expect from such a young expression from Ardbeg. The fruit and spice notes from the sherry make an appearance and really balance the flavor. A really enjoyable dram.

3.0,"Nice to have an Ardbeg in the high $30s. Nothing outstanding or unique, but nothing to complain about either."
3.75,"Finally saw this at Total Wine for $35 so had to. 10yr is about $10 more so comparison is needed. I will say the neck pour was like a scotsman in your face screaming loudly. Thats the aggressive nature of the hot smoky peat. It did mellow with air so waited to near bottle end for assessment. Poured neat nose is salted bacon fat and peanut butter. Throw in some volcanic ash and a bit of fresh malt and you're there. Palate is peaty malt with chili pepper and heavy charred barrel. A light sweetness works itself in but is always a bit player. It was much more smoke laden through the first half of bottle and spicy hot too. It calmed into a relatively drinkable Islay bargain. Finish is not as long as other contenders but still solid with standard smoke and drying malty wood notes. Overall a solid value and the new smoke & coke king. Nowhere near as complex and deep as other Ardbeg choices so you do get what you pay for here. A young raw somewhat flawed scotch that redeems itself with bold purity that you cant deny. I went back to back with the 10yr as my son was visiting and got me a bottle for fathers day....good kid. The 10 is more oily with greater complexity, richness , depth and sustain. Well worth the upcharge and makes a case for skipping wee beastie altogether. I contend this is not a dig on WB rather than a testament to how massively strong the 10 yr is. Imo this stuff is worth the purchase/repurchase especially if the 10 has a high cost spread in your region."
3.0,"Nose is pungent, smoky and sweet. The palate is pretty sweet (expected given the young age), bit spicy with the traditional ardbeg smoke. The finish is medium and salty with hints of caramel."
3.75,Light and delicious like young dark cove.
3.5,"This savory scotch is a very light straw yellow color with thin semi-watery legs.

I’d describe this nose as spunky; young perhaps, but having good character. There are notes of tar, slight acidity, iodine, sea salt, peaty smoke, graham crackers, burnt marshmallows, and nougat from a candy bar.

The palate is savory with notes of my wife’s salted dried seaweed snacks, an earthiness, leather, mint, and Fruit Gushers candy.

The finish is long with a taste of thick char and smoke."

3.0,"The other day, I happened upon a comparison of the Wee Beastie with Arbeg 10 on Eric Wait's YouTube channel.  Perhaps the most telling statement in his ten minute clip (slightly paraphrased) - ""You should compare these to whiskies side-by-side...you'll appreciate the 10 more than ever.""  An interesting observation, and one that didn't inspire me to race out to snag a bottle of the Beastie.  Fortunately, I didn't have to, thanks to a sample I received this week, kindly provided by @pbmichiganwolverine.

Yes, the Beastie pumps out smoke like a huge mound of scrap tires in a backwoods junk yard after a lightning strike.   There's more to it than that - some bitter dark chocolate, vanilla, pepper, salt, and a touch of fruitiness, but those notes are relatively restrained and don't  offset the peat and smoke.  That contrasts with the 10, which I find to be more refined and balanced.  Perhaps most importantly, young heavily peated drams sometimes leave me with a note that's akin to chlorine.  I get that note here.  It's not awful, but it's not something I find at all in the 10, where the peat is simply beautiful.  Still, the Beastie and the 10 are unmistakenly siblings; the additional five years of aging results in a nice evolution, not a transformation.

I consumed my sample over two nights, and rewrote this review no less than a half-dozen times as I pondered two questions: First, do I agree with Eric Wait? And second, would I recommend this whisky?

With respect to the first question, the additonal refinement and balance of the 10 is what I would expect for a whisky that's been aged for 10 years versus 5.  But the 10 also improves on the Beastie more than the $5-10 price differential (at least currently in my market) suggests.  Keeping in mind this is Ardbeg 10 we're talking about, the fact that I've twice described it as refined is telling.  Perspective is everything. 

To answer the second question, if you're interested in a huge smack of peat and you don't mind the youthfulness, this could be the dram for you.   For me, the Beastie begins to venture past enjoyably aggressive territory to punishingly aggressive.  For that reason, I'd happily spend a few extra bucks to get the 10.  There are other heavily peated whiskies in the same price range in my locale that I'd also choose instead, namely, Lagavulin 8 and Talisker Storm.  

Having said that, I may pick up a bottle.  Drinking it alongside the 10 is a very interesting tasting experience, and one I'd like to revisit in the future.  Thanks @pbmichiganwolverine for the pour!"

4.75,"Nose: The first time in a long time I've experienced a nose this strong - actually made me laugh a little with excitement.  Proof is absolutely evident and helping things jump out of the glass.  Over-smoked brisket, like when it borders on bitter smoke.  Bacon with a black pepper crust.  Lemon oil, wintergreen, pine.  Slight sweetness - almost like molasses.  Brine.  Green bell pepper, fire roasted poblano, smoked chipotle, paprika, bitter chocolate.  Imagine all the sliders for a mix pushed up to 10, and then all the eqs pegged with a little brick wall compression thrown onto the master bus like a modern dance track.  It's not completely unbalanced, just very forward.

Palate: Earth, vanilla, fruity sweetness.  The casks are absolutely evident on the nose, but in a very complementary way.  Oak, tannin, and char, though the tannin influence is less than you'd see in something with more age.  Dark fruits in syrup.  Citrus, mint, cucumber - getting a Limon Pepino Gatorade vibe, but with some mint tossed in for good measure.  Creamy and lactic.  Peanut brittle, dusty corn.  Wintergreen.  Tar and resin.  Sandalwood and tobacco.  Chocolate with a touch of smoked chipotle.  Pop Rocks style effervescence.  Mouthfeel is medium, bordering on medium-heavy.

Finish: A wash of brine, dust, earth, citrus, vanilla, and oak.  A swell of dill and anise show up, followed by some cocoa.  Some slightly bitter and sour characteristics play around, when coconut, sandalwood, and maduro tobacco come in.  The citrus, mint, sandalwood, coconut all hang out for a long time - great oil content here.  Very long finish.

Other notes: I'd long wondered what you'd get if you aged a heavily peated whiskey on the shorter side and instead let the more intense, raw flavors come through.  Though this makes good use of sherry cask to help make things a little more palatable, I almost wish this was just pure second or third fill bourbon instead, minimizing the influence of what the barrels held.  That put aside, this is like Uigeadail if it took off the smoking jacket and slammed three Black Eyes from Starbucks.  It's not as refined and cohesive, but it offers up something unique and well worth some exploration.  Highly recommended."
4.75,"Nose of: Fresh pepper, herbs, pine and light salty leather.

Palate: rich, light oil texture, smoked meat, and grass. 

Finish: long smooth smoke and oil salty dark chocolate tobacco."
