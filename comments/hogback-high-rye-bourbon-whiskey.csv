3.75,"Light color and body. Tastes young, but far from bad. There is a lot of spice from the higher rye mash (36%) but it's still light from the lower abv. The corn sweetness comes on the back end and lingers with an alcohol finish. I like it, but a bit more time in the barrel and a higher proof would improve it quite a bit."
