4.0,"By Jove, he’s done it. The good Dr. Lumsden has pulled off a rye maturation that tastes exactly like you’d hope: an integrated melange of Scotch with an overlay of zesty spice. The rye influence introduces itself with aromas of pepper and clove. The spirit itself is more robust than the original Glenmorangie (**), more nutty than creamy. The finish is spicy and sweet, pulling back just before it gets into the cloying territory of the Lasanta (*) or Milsean (*). It’s an idea 20 years in the making, Dr. L told me at this evening’s tasting event, and it was worth the wait for him to find the right barrels."

5.0,"[LOOK] 7% Mead [NOSE] Chaussons aux pommes, grape juice, warm pastry, light oak/vanillin, bit of earthy nutmeg & fresh cinnamon [PALETTE] Beautiful story that starts with pale malts, buttery scratch biscuits, and wanders through gentle spices, lemongrass, fennel lozenges, wisps of smoke, and ends with ginger chews and bitter lemon peel, Anjou pear slices [FINISH] More lemongrass, ginger, and asiatic herbs dominate, long and pleasantly floral, pungent [MOUTHFEEL] Firm airy structure, dynamic and well developed, elegant interplay of predominate notes"

4.0,"Glenmorangie is one of my favorite distilleries. Smooth sweet Malt. Great stuff. When I heard the new private edition was entirely aged in American Rye whiskey barrels I had to have a bottle.

Nose is characteristic of Glenmorangie with a hint of a woody spice. Palate enters smooth and sweet like the 10, but on the finish the rye starts coming through. It's scotch, don't mistake me. But it definitely has a woody spicy finish that lingers. Excellent stuff, a must buy for any Glenmorangie fan. 90-92"

4.0,"Light spicey nose. Vanilla flavor with notes of spice & oak. Oakey finish with a touch of sweetness & spice. 
Aged only in former 6 year rye whisky casks. Non-chilled filtered. Only a few thousand cases made."

4.0,A nice whisky.  Not as sweet as other Glenmorangies.
4.0,"Took a gamble on this since I loved the Tusail. The nose brought some heavy spice (duh lol) and rye notes. Pears, sawdust, vanilla, tea, tobacco, dried banana chips,  and chocolate notes. Powerful palate without dill, and you do not need any water for this one. Dark chocolate, mint, white and red peppers, star anise, and wood. Well balanced, and a real treat. The medium finish brings out orange marmalade with pith and sweet gumdrops. The spice dissipates and is thankfully not dry. This is a well done 4.25 and I can't wait to try more from Glenmorangie's Private Editions. The theme of this dram is gotta be something spicy, like ""Pioneer to the Falls"" by Interpol."

4.0,"Dramfest `18. Day 2. Had the unfortunate distinction of coming after the Balvanie Portwood 21 which was amazing but still this one redeemed itself well. Interesting dram (for a Glenmorangie), rye, honey and clove and not to oversweet. I don't know if I'd buy a bottle but I'd say 2nd favourite Glenmorangie so far. 4"

4.5,"I scored this one very highly, because it has an extremely unique taste, and which you can taste the rye, the point that it has an almost wheaty aftertaste, with underline tones of honey. Very smooth and tasteful for a 12 year, and highly recommend for a scotch drinker to have on their shelf"
