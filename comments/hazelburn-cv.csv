4.0,"Very interesting whisky. It is fresh both in nose and taste, soft and well-balanced. On one hand there are distinctive smoky drams, but overall the peat balances well with fresh, fruity aromas. Overall this is very light, smooth and fresh whisky, but there is a mysterious factor in it. I really recommend it! (190PLN)"
