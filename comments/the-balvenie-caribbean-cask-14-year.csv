4.0,Nose is honey and vanilla. Has strong fruit smell almost like a Sherry cask finish. Delicious taste. Strongly fruity but still a light dram. Lots of honey and vanilla
4.75,"Very sweet and very spicy. Sweet boost comes first then spicy boost immidiately follows.

After finishing the whole bottle, I edit my review to add more points: for now it became my top favorite whisky. I really love that rum sweetness - much more than sherry sweetness!"

4.0,"I haven’t had the other balvenie bottles to compare, but this is pretty good.  I personally am a bourbon fan, and I tend to lean on the sweater side of whiskey in general. Peat is not my forte, but for a single malt this is up there for me.  Smooth, with a bite on the front end and medium finish. If you’re trying to break into scotch, not the worst place to start."

4.0,"Very pleasant.  A little bit of smoke.  The rum influences are much more mellow and sophisticated than I expected or have experienced in Rum seasoned or Rum finished whiskeys.  This has a banana flavor with cream and tropical fruit- maybe a hint of papaya?  Not at all what I expected in a whiskey.  The malt is definitely there in the forefront, the tropical flavors are more scenery to the scotch, which is as it should be.  There is a hint of brown sugar, but it's not strong.  This is a rich, oily, creamy dram with a lot of unusual stuff going on, but it really works - the balance between the whiskey and the finish is near perfect!"
5.0,"All time favorite, big fan of dark rum, so this makes sense.  Sweet, caramel, molasses, smooth, dark rum comes through, but it’s definitely a scotch."

3.75,Thanks to my parents for buying me a bottle of this excellent Balvenie for my birthday. I had this years ago and enjoyed it. Tonight I am reminded how nice and sweet this is. It might be a little too sweet for some people but I really enjoy it. Not as super complex as others from Balvenie but a solid example of just a great Scotch. Can’t wait to have some more.

2.75,"Part 3 of my Scotch flight trilogy and definitely the one I am most excited to try. This one is currently on sale at my local Costco for $55 so this will be the pour that decides whether or not I pull the trigger on it! On to the tasting:
On the pallette boy is it super sweet. Toffee, caramel, mollasas that is somewhat offset by a pleasant and needed spice note! Mid pallette adds some fruit and brown sugar notes leading to a shortish finish with a nice spice note. 
Now, again it's a pleasant pour for sure but it's just too sweet. Even as a Bourbon drinker this has too much Rum cask influence and not enough spice to offset it. Even at $55 I think I would pass. At the $80 SRP it's a hard pass for me. If you are looking for a desert dram, this could do the job otherwise look elsewhere."

That apple pie turns to apple custard, like a caterpillar going through metamorphosis. The finish comes to a proper resolution with all the fuckery that has taken place with the nose and taste.

3.25,"I tried this at a place down the street after work. Not always the most ideal tasting conditions, but for more experimental releases like the Balvenie Caribbean Cask, in hindsight it seems like a smart, low-risk choice. 

For starters, I like a lot of the Balvenie’s other offerings, but I could not get into this one. The nose was straightforward and cloyingly sweet. I was more unimpressed with the palate - lacking. Light, and so much syrup with very little else to balance it. Searching for more ticked off sweet fruit notes, and the finish was uninspiring.

This isn’t to say I hated the Caribbean Cask - it was just, OK. I’d be willing to give this another try in the future to see if I had a poor serving, but I certainly won’t be picking up a bottle of it myself. There are better values out there.

2.5,"Balvenie 14 year old Caribbean Cask may be the most reasonably priced offering from their lackluster core range.  When this is on sale, it is almost worth it.

The short rum cask finish is evident because the rum influence is only apparent in a freshly opened bottle.  After a couple of months, the dark sugars on the nose and palate fade into the nondescript honeyed notes Balvenie uses to entice the masses.  This is noticeably smoother and richer than the 12 year old, but it is ultimately a rather average Scotch that does not feel Caribbean at all.  Vanilla, honey, oranges, and a few dollars more luxurious than Monkey Shoulder.

4.25,"Had the 12 year DW so wanted to go side by side. Poured neat, deeper color and thicker on the glass. Nose has the same rich fruit but much more depth and smoothness is very evident. The malt and wood notes are polished and warm and it smells expensive. Palate brings a balance of delicious heavy malt with fruit, oak and spice. Just a hint of peat tops it off. The rum barrel finish delivers sweet complexity and elegance. Finish is excellent with long malty fruit, honey and wood, faint coffee and some drying but not a trace of bitterness. Overall a superb scotch with no rough edges, rich deep flavor and a great finish....93/100........I find it much better than the 12yr"

2.5,"Disclaimer: This was purchased in a sampler three-pack in which the bottles are exposed to light, and it's possible I received a faulty sample if stored improperly at the warehouse.

Smooth and very minorly malty and sweet, but ultimately lacking in flavor, compared to the DW12/DW17.  The slight sweetness/maltiness fades into a funk clearly from the rum cask, but not in a bad way.

Overall, this is a very non-offensive dram, but one that is completely lacking in character and flavor."
3.75,"Sweet, easy to drink, but not a great *scotch*. It's like a replacement for rum."

3.5,"Color is amber. Nose starts with vanilla, wildflower honey, a little malt, and some fruity notes. First sip is subdued sweetness, with notes of fruit and spice at the same time. The spice wraps the fruit is a way that almost makes it feel warm. Mouthfeel is not thin, not oily. With additional sips, the vanilla starts to show, as do some oak notes and an incredibly subtle peat. The spice lingers, leaving a tingle on the tongue alongside the peat for the finish."

Je dois avouer que j'avais des attentes pour ce whisky. N'étant pas un amateur de whisky finis en fûts de rhum et après la déception du rye de Basil Hayden, j'avais mis beaucoup d'espoir en ce Balvenie, une distillerie qui ne fait que d'excellents produits. Je n'ai pas été charmé, mais je n'ai pas été déçu. Est-ce un pas dans la bonne direction? Est-ce que je vais devenir un grand amateur de whisky fini en fût de rhum? L'avenir nous le dira!"

3.75,"The Balvenie produces only unpeated whiskys (an exception is an annual special edition), unfortunately in this case chill-filtered and, alas, with added colors: a warm amber color, therefore, completely fake.
The smell is immediately sweet and caramelized, very enveloping, with cooked apple, rivers of vanilla, brown sugar (oh well, there is rum, easy!), white chocolate. It does not give you diabetes just smelling it, but it is nice and cuddly.
The risk of dismantling is also averted on the palate, with a splash of spices and wood that stops the sugary wave of flavors before it overwhelms everything, bringing a certain dryness to the background. At moments almost vinous, chocolate returns accompanied by candied orange, yellow fruit, still cane, raisins: the influence of rum is not as clear-cut as you might think (or maybe it's that I do not understand a fife of rum, in fact).
The finish is medium long, dry (almost astringent), with spices, vanilla, raisins and cooked apple."

Nose: Very light with dark sugars and malty notes.  A little honey and mango on the back.

Flavor: The rum is much more of a background note on this and I appreciate it.  Sweet and light with a buttery mouth feel, crème brulee with caramelized sugars, and a little barrel char.

Finish:  Fairly short with a little bit of oaky char and finishing with a sweet mango note.

I like this a lot.  Balvenie is apparently my thing.  I appreciate the mild rum finish that didn't beat me over the head with the rum but rather accented the finished whiskey with nice dark sugar and buttery notes.  Delicious."

3.0,"Vanilla, honey, and a lemony sour note from the oak on the nose.  The palate is vanilla and a slight fruitiness, then cane sugar.  The combination of rum and oak produces a surprising cinnamon and tobacco note (if you can find it in the spice notes that are unique to this bottle).  Follow that note and the oak makes itself known in the finish.  The cinnamon with the oak reminds me of a bourbon mid-palate-to-finish, albeit with an infusion of rum sweetness.  Different and interesting to drink, but not a personal fave.  It may fare better with a cigar.  

I don't know why I didn't like this whisky, despite the glowing reviews.  I was extremely disappointed in my palate for missing whatever that was good.  I just couldn't lock on the Balvenie flavor profile.

While rum was the currency that introduced the world to the English concept of ""proof"", it hasn't exactly done wonders here.

 - On the nose, the Caribbean Cask (CC) was sweeter and mellow.  The Fire & Cane (F&C) was strong, with a slight smokey influence in the background with fruits like orange... something citric.
 - On the palate, the CC was sweet... honey, sugary; the F&C was smoke with pears and a little sweetness, but nothing like the CC.
 - On the finish the CC was smooth and light; the F&C was strong, medium last, but it makes you remember that you are drinking a scotch whisky.

Overall I liked them both.  I will drink the CC maybe after dinner, but if I want to relax while watching an action movie, then the F&C will be the choice."

Bottled at 43%abv.

On the nose it was great. I have to be honest. Super fruity, tropical fruits. Oranges, prunes, cherry, cranberries, coffee beans. It was simply beaitiful.

But then.... water.

On the palate is just plain water. Ok lets be fair. There is a hint of vanilla. A hint of oak and some spiciness but it doesn't give you anything. It is not a rewarding dram. It is water. 

Aftertaste is short and dry. Hints of oak spice. Nothing else.

Overall i give this dram a 68 over 100 and that is because the nose was great. Then it fell apart drastically. Not recommended."

This whisky is well balanced whisky.  It has a lovely creamy vanilla taste upfront, but there’s plenty of fruit with apples and oranges and topped off with subtle molasses.  The finish is long, with a lot of citrus and vanilla.

Overall, a lovely well-rounded, sweet vanilla dram."

3.75,"Color: Honey. Moderate almost watery legs

Nose: Vanilla rum, oak, sugary apple juice, melon, tobacco

Palate: Vanilla rum, oak, apple juice, almost silky texture

Finish: Moderate with charcoal, cinnamon, green tea, tobacco notes. It's rounded out with barrel tannin and a lingering minor spice note that engulfs the tongue.

I've had a pour of this before but, I don't remember it being as good. It comes off as very rum forward on the nose and palate at first. Letting it develop, opens this dram up. It's almost chaotic but, beautifully balanced at the same time. Nose and palate are very similar. Though, on the nose I'm also picking up unripe melon and a sweet tobacco note influenced by the vanilla rum. The finish is where it's at for me. Tobacco from the nose comes back along with an amazing green tea note. Although I don't want to give this a 3.75 because of my previous experience. I have to. Credit where credit is due."

2.25,"Rum casks have always intrigued me, but always seem to let me down. I thought Balvenie might be able to change that, unfortunately I was wrong. Is it drinkable? Yes, but the sickly sweet rum flavor tastes artificial and left me disappointed once more."

4.75,Sweet hints of Oak with one of the smoothest finishes of Vanilla I’ve had. Always drink it neat with 2-3 drop of water to open it up.

3.5,"This is good. It's like the meringue of Glenmorangie 18 meets the rummy spiciness of Compass Box Spice Tree. Despite the fun rum presence here, this seems more like a quirky Scotch since there is not a lot going on. the sweetness and richness are nice, but I wish that the alcohol were less present.
It has a rich, woody scent with some rich dark fruity notes that blend in nicely. There's a bit of spice on the nose too and some interesting tartness. The nose smells delightful, if not super complex. The palate is more viscous than that of the 17, but also less rich. It has some really nice sweetness with spices and rich butterscotch. I wouldn't have thought that coming back to this I might be crowning it king of the Balvenie line, but here I am considering just that. I like it pretty well, though it is light and on the more hedonistically sweet side. There's some really nice balance of wood with baking spices and butterscotch though. The mouthfeel is really nice too. It takes the hedonistic route and succeeds. What more does it need to do? For the price, it's a questionable purchase. It reminds me a bit of Glenfiddich 14, but with a bit more sweetness and refinement perhaps. It tastes good. There's some banana, but it's light and has a bit of caramel on it. The vanilla and tropical fruits are really nicely balanced here. I'd like to try a richer, older version of this, but it hits a really nice bourbony scotch flavor profile that is classic in nature and also rich and enjoyable. It's quite a good drink. The balance here is really impressive and it's quite enjoyable to drink. A 16 is achieved easily and a 17 is definitely believable."

3.75,"Pretty strong cherry and almond nose; brown sugar, vanilla, and chocolate; smooth, unctuous; dry caramel and brown sugar finish; really nice for its subtle, but complex and dark flavors the rum lends"

3.5,"Copper color. Fruit-forward nose with red grapes and stewed plums, hints of burnt sugar, vanilla bean and cocoa powder. Light bodied mouthfeel. Flavors are subtle and hard to pick out but I'm getting more stewed fruits, candied apples and chocolate covered pretzels. Finish is pretty short and unimpressive, maybe some grapes and sweet red cherries, and a little peppercorn spice."
