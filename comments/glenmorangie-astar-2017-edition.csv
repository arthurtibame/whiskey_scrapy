null,"""""""""** Disclaimer: This review is what I would consider a “Quick Hit”- meaning I won’t have my usual in-depth notes that I usually like to take. The reason: this sample was poured at Whiskyfest DC on 4/17/18. All of these reviews will not be scored and I am actively looking to try them again at some point to do them more justice.

This is another malt that wasn’t listed on the official pour list, so when I saw it I immediately snagged a taste while chatting with the Glenmorangie/Ardbeg rep, Clarke Boyer, about how this new version compares to the old 2008 bottling.  I echoed his sentiments upon tasting the new stuff.  I had a pour of the original about a month ago at a bar here in Richmond and found it to be fantastic, especially on the nose.

The 2017 release tries very hard to reproduce the nose, but fell just a tiny bit short IMO.  The palate was okay- plenty of oak and vanilla, while imitating almost every other GM I’ve had at this point.  It’s pretty smooth but lacks much depth.  There’s complexity and florals on the nose, but the palate doesn’t really deliver (unlike the 2008 version- it was wonderful).  This one plays well on the nose and had a respectable finish, I just wish it had a little more depth on the palate.  All that said, it’s still close to a 4-star dram and one of my favorite Glenmorangie’s to date."
5.0,Has really good flavor sweet fruits and oak and with a splash of water it will open the flavor profile very nicely and tame the heat very smooth

2.0,"This is another ohio discount where I think I paid 60 for it.  Though i think this retails in the 100 range.  

Nose - Vanilla custard...very dessert like.  Maybe some marmalade.  Very simple and very sweet.  

Taste - I get a lot of american oak.  To the point one could tell me this was fresh oak (I know it wasn't) finished.  There's some nice creme brulee finish.  This is soft and sweet oak and vanilla.  A bit of char and maybe a hint of milk chocolate (think the chocolate milk stuff).  

A perfectly fine, sweet, oak, vanilla whisky.  I'm going 2 stars as I like the mouth feel and abv.  There's not much going on here beyond just being a nice sweet dessert whisky."

4.25,"Second taste edit: peach and stone fruit, minty herbaciousness. Better than I remember, but 4.25 is a good place for it to stay put. 
The bourbon character is pronounced, and the barley shines. It’s a high proof for Glenmorangie, but they throw a catchable ball, that’s for sure. Peaches and cream are forward, wrapped in a lingering earthiness characteristic of the distillery. Other than that, maybe some light citrus, but not a ton of complexity. It’s a pleasant dram that drinks smoother than the proof and plates its few notes well."
