4.25,"Nose - Oak spice, caramel, cinnamon spice, mint, citrus fruit, strong alcohol vapor.
Taste - Honey, caramel and brown sugar, vanilla, oak.
Finish - Quick sweetness, long spice and alcohol burn.

This in an exceptional whiskey that bludgeons you with flavors. On the nose, you are hit with a hint of oak, followed by baking spices, and fruit.

The taste begins with honey. For me, it conjures memories of my great Grandmother who always had fresh honey. She was a bee keeper that traveled town to town selling honey. Following the honey, there's brown sugar and caramel, then  vanilla, and finally a hint of oak carries over from the nose.

On the finish, the sweetness vanishes rapidly, but it is followed by a longer spice tingling on the tongue and warming from the high proof.

Highly recommended. If you spot a Knob Creek Single Barrel Select, be sure to grab one before it is gone."
