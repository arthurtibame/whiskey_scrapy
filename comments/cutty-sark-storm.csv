4.0,"A very interesting dram, nice aroma notes and a powerful palate. Not the best whisky there is but not bad at all.

Bottled at 40%

On the nose, citric is the name of the game. Cream vanilla, Prunes, LEMON: lemon peel, Lemon pie.

On the palate a little less appealing, but still good. Caramel, Pepper explosion, Salt, Feels like talisker. Slight peat. Short finish with Bitter tobacco and ginger finish. 

Overall a very nice whisky that won't change anyone's life but definitively worth a couple of drams every now and then. 81/100"
3.25,"Nothing bad with notes of honey, vanilla, grain and light fudge note but not much complexity or mouth feel."
4.5,"příjemná blended whisky, žádnej kouř, nasládlá, čerstvě otevřená, přesto jemná. koupil bych si"

2.0,"I figured the name ""Storm"" implied extra peat and/or seaside character. But that's not the case (there's a bit of a Highland Park-style earthy, vegetal peat, but it's by no means in your face). Rather, the gimmick here is using older single malts (including some sherried ones) on a bed of the same grain whiskies used in the standard Cutty Sark. The results aren't terrible, especially for the price-tag, but it's nothing to write home about. Flavours of sherry, light smoke, light vegetal peat. Vanilla, tequila. Rubbing alcohol. Strawberries, some floral, crab-apples, pickled ginger. Popcorn butter, sea salt, earthy, ash. Soya sauce? Some of the constituent single malts (Macallan, Highland Park) are actually really recognizable in this blend. You could do worse for the $30 Cdn. I paid for this, but it's by no means a great whisky."
null,wow...I'm surprised by Stephanie's mid-80s ranking...I guess I always associated Cutty Sark with bottom shelf stuff
