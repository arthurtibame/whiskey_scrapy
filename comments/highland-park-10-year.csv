4.0,"How can anyone complain about a whisky that's delicious and inexpensive? Sure it won't blow your mind and palate, but it's $60 CAD! A touch of oak, a touch of caramel... wonderful, though it lacks body and finish. Good stuff."
2.0,Dans la moyenne sans plus
3.0,"Being attracted by great ratings of HP 12 and 18 I decided to start from the least mature malt of the renowned distillery. And to be honest - I got slightly disappointed. It is a decent whisky, with a very interesting aroma, but taste is very mediocre with nothing to discover there. I will try HP 12 this week and I really hope it will do better (85PLN, 0,35l)."

3.0,"Really well done dram, honey and vanilla all wrapped in a nice smoke. In my opinion not as good as hp12, it has more vanilla as opposed to the honey sweetness which I like. But definitely delicious all the same"

4.0,"Uses mostly Spanish oak. Using 2 cask types - American and Spanish. Made exclusively for canada initially. A high concentration is 15years and above. 
      
    Pale gold in colour. 
    
      Nose: vanilla, beads showing good viscosity.  Citrus notes  - some of the smokies highland park - older it gets the less smoke/peat.  Peat is mixed with heather which gives honey sweetness. Trademark of highland park. 
      Palate: 
      Finish: sweet, honey - dark chocolate. Woody. Side of toubge is spicy like ginger. Tip of tongue brings sweetness. 
  Body 2/4 - light"
4.0,"Great dram. Butterscotch, honey and vanilla on the nose. A bit of citrus, honey, almonds and a hint of smoke on the palate. Really enjoyable."

4.0,"A great dram for the price. This 10 year old already has lots of characteristics that I've tasted in 15 - 18 year old scotches. The peat on the nose is not to over powering along with a great, honey taste. A long, mild sweet taste will certainly bring me back for more."

3.0,"Floral and lightly peated nose. Light malt, toffee and lemon peel on the palate. The finish is shorter and a bit spicier than its 12-year counterpart, but a respectable dram nonetheless. Good value dram for those setting sail on the viking journey ($60 CAD)."

Pas la petite étincelle pour en faire un whisky dont on se souvient, mais pas de défaut. Un très bon whisky moyen, qui donnera de superbes choses en vieillissant (pensons au 18 ou au 25 ans...)."

Bouche : poire au miel, légère tourbe, alcool qui se cherche, poussière, pelures d'amandes, un peu d'orange séchée. Texture un peu légère sans être aqueuse, l'alcool rend le tout un peu rapeux à mi-gorgée mais les saveurs énoncées au début le masquent bien."

4.0,"The first time I tried the HP10, I didn't love it.  In hindsight, my disappointment sprang from the fact that it didn't quite seem like HP to me, lacking the dark fruit and lovely peat of the 12 and 18.  Having just tried it for the second time, my opinion has changed. 

The HP10 is different, but very good in its own right.  Yes, it's lighter and more citrus in nature, but the interplay between the smoke and the fruit is classic HP.   It's also somewhat complex.  Most interestingly to me, the combination of fruitiness and oak give it a note that comes straight out of Speyside.

This may never be my favorite HP, but it's interesting, enjoyable, and a bargain to boot."

4.0,"Nose: Malty, heathery, and slightly smoky with some tinges of orange and honey. There is also a hint of the seashore with some light salty mineral notes floating about. Fresh, bracing and invigorating. [The dry glass is slightly sooty honey].

Palate: Heather smoke and honeyed malt arrival that develops quickly into a full-bodied cereal palate with some bitter/sour citrus notes along the edges. It's crisp and clean with some spicy ginger notes and a little crème caramel towards the finish. Charming!

Finish: Medium. The honeyed cereal character drifts into a delightful sweet barley sugar aftertaste.

Overall this is a very fresh, crisp and almost disarmingly honest whisky caught at the first blush of its maturity.

The nose has everything that will, with more maturation, fill out into the familiar Highland Park smoky-honeypot profile, but here it is beautifully encapsulated in its vigorous, nascent form. The smoke, although subtle,  is more prominent than you would expect and it works wonderfully.

The palate is crisp and clean and has excellent texture - just slightly creamy and full of nutty hints. It is enticing and seductive neat, with no heat whatsoever, which is how I'd recommend taking it. Normally I add a small dash of water to my drams, but this simply doesn't need it. I shudder to think how addictive it would be at lower strength, with more sweetness released.

This is delicious whisky, and a steal at the asking price. I actually prefer it's slightly brusque charm to the profile of the 12 year old, which has slipped a bit of late. In fact (and this will set the cat among the pigeons) I'll say outright that this is the best value Highland Park currently available, and that includes all the special NAS releases and the other age statements up to and including the 18 year old. The 18 has more finesse, but it's also about 3 times the price. You need to move up to the 25 year old to arrive at something that beats this hands down, but by then you're paying about 10 times the price.

Seriously, if you've not tasted this pick up a bottle - it's inexpensive and very good.  Try it in a horizontal flyte against some of the recent NAS expressions and prepare for a re-calibration.

The official notes here by Blair Phillips are right on target and sum this up perfectly, but the score undervalues it.  Highly recommended, particularly if you can find an older bottling (like the one in the picture on this site) without the viking animal-figure pattern in the glass.

""Very Good” : 4 stars"
