3.5,"Not as good as the other Editions I’ve quite liked (2 and 3 in particular), but still fairly full of flavor and better than the entry-level offering. Decently rich barley color, dependent on how it catches the light. 

Fairy aromatic; a bit of undefinable sweetness with a fair amount of charred wood and some ginger and herbal spice. A bit of butter and caramel on the palate, with some spice as well. At the roof of the mouth, you get a bit of flavor like lemon-lime soda."

4.0,Cigar on the balcony after a long week. Tasty shit man
3.25,Decent scotch but for the price I would not buy again. The 2019 classic cut was much better.
4.0,"Explosion of vanilla on the nose, from an alcohol-soaked dessert (like a cream baba or a malaga), drop of honey, raisins, cinnamon, candied orange. Alcohol does not give room in time, while always remaining tied to the pastry vocation of whisky.
On the palate it is practically a cake distillate, even more than on the nose, oriented on the English soup with a massive presence of orange and vanilla cream, with alcohol that gives a light liveliness but without overdoing it. Linear in the aromas, without any significant variation, even letting it breathe.
Medium length finish, with raisins, vanilla, hazelnut.
This whisky evokes images from an English tea room, with upright ladies munching creamy desserts with silver forks, mulling over the latest news from the Royal Family.
Rather simple and clean, does't present much evolution or complexity, it offers what it promises, a pleasant drink and nothing more."

3.25,Sorta intense. Maybe too much. Smells cool but intense. Tastes sharp and vanilla? Fruity?
4.5,"I get raisins, sherry and a hint of Christmas spice on the nose. The taste is smooth with fruity spice. Wonderful whisky"
3.0,"Nose: raisin, toffee, orange
Palate: light oak, stewed fruit w/hint of spice
Finish: sweet and long
This would have gotten a higher score, but for the price and the truly disappointing color. I bought it without looking inside, because if I had I probably wouldn't have bought it. If I were inclined to be generous I'd say the color is understated. It had a really off-putting flavor when I first opened it which also affected the score. If this had been 60-70 dollars I'd say pick up a bottle, but as the price stands I can't recommend this, and quite frankly I'm surprised this passed muster."
4.0,"Similar to Macallan Edition no. 4. On the nose: pear, oak, almost lighter wine, an undertone of brown sugar,  and nutty. On the palate: nutty, pears, spices, a glimpse of lemon or ginger. The finish: long, sweet, spicy. In closing: Macallan no 4 blows this away, they've taken the adventure from it and merely shortened it rather than taking this scotch to a new direction. Oddly enough for a couple decades in the business, Sarah Burgess could take notes from Nick Savage. Not to mention the $20+ price hike for less of a venture to the unknown, but rather to the already-discovered and lazily pressed forward."

3.25,"Nose - Fruity raisin-y caramel, hint of candied ginger, candied orange peel, toffee, dark apple juice

Taste - Spicy candied ginger, candied orange peels, toffee, milk chocolate, prunes, dark raisins, M&M candy shell sweet?

Finish - Lingering candied ginger spice, candied orange peels, orange sugar coated jelly candy?, plain M&Ms, weird metallic fruity sweet

Score - 74/100

Final Thoughts - So this one was a bit interesting in that it didn't really taste like the standard Macallan profile of a nicely sherried Scotch. This had more of a candied fruit vibe to it with a hint of raisins/prunes. Interesting nose that carries over to the palate but the finish has this weird metallic fruity sweet that I find a bit off-putting. Overall it's pretty decent, but the finish kind of kills it. The longer I wait, the more metallic & strange sweet I get from this and it's a bit distracting.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - Not another"

4.5,"My first NAS Macallan.  Very rich and an almost silky texture.  I'd happily drink more, but probably not at the price point of $110+.  If you like Macallan, you'll without a doubt enjoy this if you have the opportunity."
4.5,One of the most interesting whiskeys I’ve had in a long time. S’mores but instead of a chocolate bar I get dark chocolate. Graham cracker toasted marshmallow. Opens up into fresas con crema with strawberries cream and nuts. Then a second of a berry fruit basket. It’s complex it’s rich it’s one of my favorites.
4.25,"Wonderful blend of dark fruits and spices. Adding a few drops of water tones down the spices and opens up the fruits. Macallan fans will love it . Yes, it’s a lot of money for a no-age-statement scotch (I paid $104), but if you are comfortable buying whiskies at that price point, then I say go for it you won’t be disappointed."
3.0,"This would have gotten a higher score, but for the price was  truly disappointing.  If this had been 60-70 dollars I'd say pick up a bottle, but as the price stands I can't recommend this, and quite frankly I'm surprised this passed muster.Id much rather have Tamdhu Cask Strength at half the price or even if price was not a factor. I wanted to try a ""Good McCallan and not just the 12 but for $125 I can find whisky that blows this away by a huge margin. I feel MaCallan should be ashamed of themselves and eventually are ruining their name for the normal drinkers. If I want to spend 1 to 4 K dollars I'm sure they make wonderful whiskies but their common stuff is.....well.....shite! Still in shock that I spent $125 for this mediocre dram!"

4.0,"Pour tasting of this, extremely flavorful nose, considerably rich with varied red fruits, currant, raisins and mild mid spices, I thought the balance was spot on and well done.  The malt comes in late and subdued with only the mildest hints of smoke, making this a nice drink for those not into heavy peat.  The varied cask smoothness was notable and the combined output  just seems to work well.  Yes the legendary Macallan smooth finish is alive and present here.

I've only tried the No. 4 (previous edition) so not much to go on by comparison but I found the No. 5  more varied in notes and overall more satisfying and interesting.   These bottles always seem to be a bit pricey which is of course part of the planned limited availability but I wouldn't hesitate to grab one if found on the low range of the price scale."

2.5,"The good old days of Macallan are over, and it’s been like that for a while.  I don’t want to rehash those good old days, but instead wanted to take this NAS bottle for what it is:  an effort to place a premium whisky on the shelves, competing for your dollar against a plethora of others in the same $120 range.  With that standard...I think it’s failed.  You can do much better for much less.  

I had a small pour at a tasting ( and yes...I did buy a bottle namely to keep my Edition 2 onwards intact).  I don’t get anything special in this pour:  aroma of dry fruits and nuts; taste of dates and peaches.  If I had to give kudos to one thing—it’s the awesome label color —-but honestly, who gives a rat’s ass about label color.  Personally, in just one man’s opinion, I’d be a buyer of this for two reasons only:  either to collect as a Macallan Edition bottle, or a fancy gift with a nice label color"

4.25,"Mild oak spice on the palate, sweeter on the finish."
4.25,"Bright baking spices, honeyed toffee, vanilla, and orchard fruits. A very balanced whisky."
3.75,I have to say this bottle have opened up nicely more so than any other bottle I have experienced. Its quite good now after being open for 3 months now and @ 2/3 bottle.

3.25,"Finishing up my reviews of the Macallan Edition series with this year’s release, Edition No. 5, courtesy of @LeeEvolved. This newest edition is bottled at 48.5% ABV and is non chill filtered and natural color of amber. 

This particular Macallan uses a high proportion of ex bourbon barrels, and it shows. Even though all of the casks were sherry seasoned, the first note I got on the nose was bourbon, and a lot of it. The American oak really stands out and delivers a ton of sweetness. Copious amounts of vanilla, caramel and brown sugar. The sherry starts to come through a little with golden raisins, chocolate and sweet grapes. There was something that kept me wondering for a while, and then all of a sudden it hit me...kettle corn. First time I’ve ever gotten that and it was very interesting. Donut glaze, powdered sugar. If smells could rot your teeth this would carry a warning from the American Dental Association. Peaches & cream, vanilla custard, sweet oaky notes. After it sits a good long while I started to get apples and pears as well. 

The palate had a somewhat sweet entry, followed by a surprisingly spicy arrival. Very oaky with lots of wood spice. Again, way more bourbon than sherry. Slightly astringent. Vanilla, a bit sour, and that odd kettle corn note from the nose. A little barrel char, aromatic, a touch floral and some hay. Little to no sherry presence, some orange peel, but nothing else in the way of fruits. A little salt and chocolate, but way too much oak. 

A medium to full bodied mouthfeel that is astringent, mouthwatering, then dry. 
The finish is medium long with oak, bourbony oak, tannic oak, clove and ginger. 

I really enjoyed the nose on this one for how oddly sweet it was and that unique kettle corn note, but the palate completely undermined that enjoyment. It’s as if they created this whisky solely on the nose alone, smelled the end result and said, that’s perfect, no need to taste it, I’m sure it’s fine. The palate was overly harsh and way over oaked. The worst of the Edition series I’ve had. It’s not even recognizable as a Macallan. I’d give the nose a 4, but the palate struggles to get past a 2.75 or 3 at best. So for that I will give it a 3.25. 
Cheers"

1.25,"Welp my least respected distillery, but people keep raving about this to me. Lets find out how disappointing this is.

Nose - fruity, baking spices, vanilla, surprisingly heavy amounts of sherry given the casks used. The sherry is almost reaching into a white grape juice level of sweetness. 

Taste - tired casks. Oak, muted, and off. There are nice sherry notes, some good vanilla oak, but the overall combination is really awful. I mean this is legit awful. There's too much oak, it's astringent, it's bitter, drying. 

Welp, macallan never disappoints anymore. Every bottle is worse than the last. Makes me sad given how good their stuff used to be and how most of that has vanished from the shelves. 

Giving this is a 1 star. It's not bad, but there's nothing good about this. I really can't find anything nice or good to say about it, but it's drinkable, you'll be perfectly happy to have a glass of this if it's free. But beyond that...why would you not drink a good whisky? A good whisky that costs 1/10 as much....

Edit - changed my mind. The nose is actually good on this. It's just a pathetic effort to blend a good whisky."
