4.0,I could inhale its sweetly perfumed aromas for long enough to lose myself in a fantasy landscape of violets and heather. There's a lemon note too that foreshadows flavors of pink grapefruit underpinned by a blast of smoke and oak. Its goodbye kiss brings to mind the buttery Meyer lemon sauce that graced my cod last night. No wonder the bottle's gone down quicker than many a pricier dram in my collection.

5.0,"How does this happen? Someone here explain to me how Distiller gave this whisky an 84 score! It's mindbending I tell you! From start to finish you're treated to a wonderful amalgam of aromatic wonder, and at 50% ABV it all hits you with so much confidence and presence. The craftsmanship behind Fusion is simply brilliant. The nose is fruity and tropical, with hints of mangoes as a waft of tropical notes evaporates  from the glass. The palate is all-encompassing to your mouth as a touch of peat, smoke, and iodine fuse with brown sugar and barley. The finish is rich with the addition of wood notes (I know it's oak but it really just comes across as general yet delicious lumber), lingering for minutes on end. Brilliantly done, Amrut!"

#11: Amrut Fusion.  Batch 58.  Single Malt from India.  50% ABV.  NAS.
Paid $76
I’m going to be buying this again, but will be on the lookout for older batches.  I will also be buying higher end Amruts no doubt.  I am impressed.

This isn’t Scotch?  I’ll be damned.  So, it’s using both dried peated Barley from Scotland and Indian barley, but it’s 100% distilled in India at Amrut.  It is damp, humid, woody peat reek on the nose with a solid dash of spices and florals.  The palate reminds of me of a recent experience with Ardbeg Corryvreckan.  Sweet peat with loads of spiciness.  It’s got a little bit of chalkiness, which I hear is a problem in the more recent batches, and is a departure from the earlier batches that won just about every award and accolade out there.  The batch 58 I own is a great whisky and worth the asking price, but it is not an award winner.  For all its complexity, it’s also quite sharp.  In Scotland, accelerated maturation using smaller casks tend to create this spiky profile.  In India, I’m sure it’s the climate.

Palate: Sweet dried fruit, followed by peat. Unctuous and thick mouth feel. Letting it breathe for a good 20 minutes and adding a few drops of water really helps bring out the flavours while making it more pleasant to keep in the mouth and fully savour. If I didn't know this was from India I would think it was a peated Highland scotch.
Finish: Solid medium length. Fruity sweetness and subtle peatiness hangs around for nice little while.

I originally rated this at 5 stars but having tried some truly amazing scotches lately has forced me to revise my initial rating. Still, this deserves 4.25 stars because it's amazing what Amrut has accomplished here with a whisky that is only aged 4-5 years! This is delicious, enjoyable, affordable and could serve as a great introduction to peated whisky."

4.25,"info: Un whisky qui combine l'orge himalayen (75%) et de l'orge tourbé d’Écosse (25%). C'est deux composante sont distillé et vieilli séparément pendant 4 ans. Ensuite, on ""fusionne"" ces deux composantes pendant 3 mois. Pour ceux qui ne savent pas, l'inde est un joueur important dans l'industrie du Whisky et la distillerie Amrut s'est taillé une place sur le marché mondiale. Le fusion est le produit qui a reçu le plus d'éloge et qui a fait la renommé mondiale de la distillerie Amrut. Tout a débuté après que ce produit ait été nommé le 3e meilleur whisky au monde de 2010 selon la Whisky Bible de Jim Murray. De plus, Ian Buxton en a fait son 3e whisky ""to try before you die"". 

nez: Boisé, force d'alcool perceptible au nez (50%, c'était à anticipé), crème et fumé. 

Bouche: fruit rouge et fumé. Une présence céréalière et une fumé bien affirmé. un peu plastique cette fumé. Un peu à la Highland Park, si vous voyez ce que je veux dire (sans rien enlever à Highland Park). Plus fruité sucré que salé mais tout de même une touche de sel dans la tourbe. Chocolat noir? C'est ce que les notes de dégustation indique mais, tout ce que je perçois de similaire c'est le petit goût amer derrière ces fruits confits. Peut-être que ce n'est que ça en fait... J'associerais ce goût amer à du café plutôt que du chocolat.

Finale: Longue sur cette note de fumé amer fruité et boisé. 

Overall: Certains ne seront probablement pas d'accord mais je le catégoriserais dans la même palette aromatique que le Highland Park Dark Origin et le Benromach 100 proof. Mais bon, je renouvelle maintenant mon affirmation en effectuant la dégustation en parallèle. Je ne sais pas si c'est moi mais j'ai l'impression que cette ""fusion"" n'est pas entière. Il y a une certaine ""distance"" entre ces deux arômes de fruité et de fumé. Un peu comme si j'avais moi même mixé quelques single malt tourbé et fruité. Après le workthrough de la bouteille je trouve que les arômes se perde rapidement après oxydation. À boire rapidement après l'ouverture car après 3 semaines, le fruité avait déjà commencé a s’effacer. J'ai tout de même très apprécié ces moments passés avec cette bouteille et ça me donne envie d'explorer davantage la distillerie Amrut. Pour avoir gouté aussi la version originale, je préfère de loin cette expression plus complexe par son jeu de fruit rouge et de fumé. Je suis aussi très impressionné du rapport qualité prix, je ne peu pas omettre cet aspect qui rehausse aussi ma note. Bref, belle complexité malgré certaines faiblesses et un prix plus que raisonnable. Et, pour l'originalité ça vaut un bonus aussi. Effectivement un must de la catégorie ""to try before you die"". 84%"

3.0,"My first tasting of this whiskey was a poor one. On first nosing (unwatered @50%) I got strong alcohol (paint thinner) and banana - neither my favourite in a whiskey. The more I sniffed the more overpowering and headache inducing it was. Twenty minutes later it still felt like I was punched in the snout.

However, on subsequent tastings, watered down and left for a while to open I found this to be a fine whiskey.   I got new wood on the nose. and the taste of dark chocolate, biscuits and some dried fruit, almost like a sherried whiskey (although I believe this isn't).

Taste - Lightly toasted/smoky coconut, grilled pineapple, artificial ""berry"" flavors, banana nut bread, hint of sweet/hot pepper

Finish - Lingering light tingle, wisp of smoke, lingering starchy sweet, banana, pineapple, maybe some papaya?

Score - 84/100

Final Thoughts - So this was interesting as the peat was quite light and the nose was oddly quite muted. A tiny bit of water helped open it up but not much. Overall nice balance and the peat/smoke is gentle enough where it might be a good introductory to peat type of dram. A bit of water does help soften up the initial heat a bit but doesn't mute the flavors too much. Typical tropical vibe from this malt and is a nice sipping one, but nothing really spectacular.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

3.75,"Moderately peated with a hint of sherry. For me, it was similar to something like a Benromach 10 but a bit richer with more of a sherry and dark fruit influence. Very good, although the $70 price tag for a 4-5 year old whisky that is similar to an entry-level peated scotch makes me wonder about the value. A single malt from India is a pretty cool talking point, however."

3.75,"Amrut is becoming a star in the whiskey industry, and I can see why. The expressions I have had have been quite good and distinct. The Fusion is maybe my favorite of the group.

I get a strong coffee bean and malt taste to it. The Fusion runs a bit hot, especially for a 50 ABV, but that adds to the taste.

I only tasted this as a pour (~$12) and do not have a bottle. Yet. I plan on getting one of these bottles someday, but finding it on sale for under $70 is tough. This is a good one, but not to the $80 price tag I've seen it around town.

I got to try five different expressions from Amrut over the course of the evening, plus some delightful punch made with their peated single malt.

This one ranked #1 of the evening for me, if for nothing else that I can afford it and it's available in my area. The peat is really thoughtfully blended into this pour, and doesn't overpower the Indian malted barley, and the finish just goes on forever. It  almost reminds me of High West Campfire. I'm adding this one to my collection for sure. I can see why Jim Murray liked it so much when it first came out."

3.25,"This is a young one (4-5 years old) but because of the extreme heat in Indian, it ages faster than other whiskies. 

I had a 10 ounce sample and, when I first opened it, I was surprised by the lively flavors. I got caramel, applesauce with cinnamon, almonds, and a touch of smoke. The 50% abv definitely helps punch things up a couple of notches.

I had hoped that it would continue to develop as it oxidized but that didn’t really happen. It started losing its energy, the flavors became more muted and it started showing it’s youth. 

Overall, it’s interesting enough that I’ll look to explore other, older Amruts in the future but don’t plan to buy a full bottle of the Fusion."

Bottled at 50 abv, tawny color.

On the nose is beautiful. So fruity. Naranjilla, cough syrup, caramel, lime, citric aromas, hazelnut, hanuta snack, almonds. 

On the palate it was totally different but great. Fire. Coal. Peat, ashes. It burns your lips. Aftertaste is sulphuric but not long, pleasant.

Overall this is an extraordinary dram. Absolutely recommended. 95 over 100."

4.0,"That peat is really present on the nose. There is also plenty of fruit though. Tasting it, the peat and cherry come through immediately, but so does a surprising mesquite smoke and spice flavor. I appreciate the sweetness and also how it balances with the peat. That's often difficult to pull off, but since the flavors isn't aggressively bitter and tart, it works well here. It's surprisingly smooth for 50% ABV. The richness and balance are nice, but a bit more richness would be nice. This kind of reminds me of Westland Peated, but it seems a bit less complex and plain delicious. The Amrut Portonova may have that weird cardboard flavor that this doesn't, but it also has a lot of richness and some additional complexity. This kind of tastes like Peated cherry Pepsi, which I must admit is better than regular cherry Pepsi because eit avoids that grossly bitter finish, but it also has some mineral and mild salty flavors that strive to be Scotch but don't quite make it. This is absolutely a sipper that I would be happy to drink on most occasions, but it also needs to have more complexity and richness. Sweet, fruit, rich, peat, smoke. It's like cherry Pepsi whiskey. It's very good, but also quite odd. It's hedonistic in a pretty dumb way, but I'd be happy to drink this. The balance is shockingly successful. Everything that this tries, it succeeds at. It's odd, but it is also delightful. Amrut Portonova is generally better, but this wins over it because of that weird wet cardboard flavor in the Portonova."

4.0,I like it with water better. It is surely a different whiskey. Strong nose and fruity taste. And a long finish.

3.75,"I found this to be a good whisky.  On the nose this is a little dark, sweet, spicy.  On the palate I get a little peat, spicy and warm.  The finish lingers a bit, probably due to the higher ABV.  I think this is a good whisky, but for the price (around $80) there's a lot of choices out there."
1.25,"The true test - I didn’t finish the sample.  I like peated, a lot, but I don’t like this."
4.5,"Nose:
Strong bourbon notes. Or is it sherry? The opening salvo of the nose reminds me of the intense caramel apple pie I get from Nikka Whisky from the barrel. All of this is enveloped in a Talisker-esque smoke that just adds layer of character to the liquid. The eclectic angles of attack from this whisky make it wonderfully  complex.

Palate:

Full and mouth-filling caramel apple pie appear as a constant log of flavor, made possible by the high alcohol by volume. White pepper heat makes an appearance afterwards, again reinvoking Talisker. Then, milk chocolate appears towards the end that I usually get from Sherried scotch (although no Sherry was mentioned in the production of this one). Again, wonderfully complex

Finish:

Long and persisting notes of the caramel apple pie

Don't sleep on Indian single malts because they are brilliant"
