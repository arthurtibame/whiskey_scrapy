3.75,"Golden yellow in the glass, all natural.
The nose is sweet and delicate, with marked herbaceous hints, very fresh.  Rusks, honey, almonds, a touch of cherry: not very complex, young, but pleasant.
On the palate, barely pungent alcohol, accompanying without stunning the freshness of the lawn which is the background to a profile that is always very delicate: still honey and almonds, biscuits, a pinch of lemon and salt, wood. Considering the harshness of the place where it was distilled, it is a very peaceful and still whiskey, simple and linear.
The finish is medium-long, with wood, grass and lemon."
