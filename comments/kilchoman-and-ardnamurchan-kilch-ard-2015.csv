4.25,"Ok I thought google knew everything. Even if i horribly mistyped google would remedy it...but this is a ghost whisky...I just can't for the life of me find anything about it other than a random foreign language Twitter feed pick and the fact that I drank it and loved it. Decent price as well. Two great distilleries come together and surprise surprise make an awesome dram!

Update: Mashing words around I see there is now a random whisky base entry
