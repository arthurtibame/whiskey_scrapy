4.0,"Once one learns to pronounce the Bunnahabbain expressions properly, it's quite fun to impress people :). The Cruach Mhona isn't an exeption. Even more fun is the fact that the liquid itself doesn't fail to impress either. The Cruach Mhona delivers Peat with a big P, combined with sweet spices, salty caramel, some brown sugar, and a hint of licorice. The after tast lingers on quite a while, and is very satisfying. At this price-level, it can't get much better, in my opinion."

4.5,"This is an unusual Bunnahabhain - in a good way!  This is a peated NAS expression, which while not unusual for Islay, Bunnahabhain is usually an un-peated whisky.

The first taste is smooth, caramel sweet and smoky.  As it develops in the mouth, you get the typical brine, alongside citrus and pepper which stays right through the medium long finish.  The aftertaste is citrus, pepper and sweet smoke.

Overall, a delicious NAS dram.  Definitely a favourite from Bunnahabhain."

3.75,"This one was a special experience for me. I usually have a problem when it comes to heavily peated whisky that have those bacon / fireplace / ash aromas (like Port Charlotte).

But even though this one here has these features I kinda liked and enjoyed it. 

The nose is cold ash but also more dominantly like a wooden fire. But equally present are some citrus aromas and green spices. 

The taste while quiet burny comes with roasted bread that is almost burned in a toaster. There also is some nutty flavors where especially pistachios are sticking out for me. It remains citrusy and stays quite long with that sourness and a long enduring peaty smoke. 

Having tasted this I hope that I will get more in line with heavily peated whiskies in the future. After some drams of this one I think I can reckon where peat-lovers are coming from. I definitely see what it is about now. Thanks Bunnahabhain for this eye opener. 

Edit: the more often I drink it, the more I enjoy it. It really is interesting, smooth, delicious, briny and isn’t at all musty or stinky. It is like a fresh roasted pan of fruits (orchard & exotic too) from a wood smoker."

4.0,"One of the bonus samples provided by my friend @Telex for this final round  of our distillery tour.  This is part of the “freakin good but hard to pronounce “ Bunna series.  Having this now on a fine Sunday evening, while making grilled pizza.  Maybe it’s the combo of charcoal grill aroma combined with this briny sea taste, but it’s just amazing.  Brine, seaweed, out on the deck of a fishing vessel aroma, with a capers and smoke taste.  I need to seek out a bottle at some point.  Out of the “unpronounceable “ series, this might be my favorites.  Thanks Jason for the pour!"

4.0,"Nose: It's a bright, clear day on Islay. Brillant blue skies, warm sunshine and a bracing onshore breeze lift the senses as you take a morning stroll on the foreshore at Bunnahabhain Bay. Sunlight sparkles off the water and you suddenly smell the aroma of a beach bonfire - dried kelp burning on the sand, carried to you on occasional gusts of wind.  Upwind, someone opens a container of freshly shucked oysters and squeezes lemon over them, and on the hills to the west someone starts a diesel engine and fires up a Toscano cigar.

Palate: Delicate sweet-brine on the entry with developing peppery smoke and a delightful oily texture. As it unfolds, the peat-smoke builds and expands, gaining a warm and comforting tarry quality and a phenolic presence. Creosote, lemon, Seville orange, rhubarb, sage and brine build alongside the smoke.

Finish: Medium/long. Initially herbal, smoky and citric, but the late finish and aftertaste bring a most unexpected chocolate-malt note, which is delightful.

The initial nose is refreshing and crisp, and continues to open and develop as it rests. After a while, sweeter fruity aromas become apparent and these are in turn followed by more lemon, some soy sauce and just a little discreet oak.  It's a marvellous nose, and classic Islay all the way. The palate is just a half point less impressive than the nose but that does not mean it disappoints, as it has a rich and satisfying character. Don't add water, this is just perfect neat.

An (unfortunately) rare example of a good value TRE bottling. At retail prices, when it's available, this costs about AUD$160, but when I purchased it at Sydney airport a while back it was AUD$115 for a 1 litre bottle, and at that price I'd certainly recommend it. It's very different in profile to the Lagavulin 16 I tasted yesterday, but easily its equal.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"
4.5,"Au nez : sec et poivré, une belle note de céréale, particulièrement de foin, tourbe amer et marine, puis vient une amande légèrement épicée, le tout toujours accompagné d’une touche d’algue et d’une touches d’herbes aromatiques 
Au palais : poivré et tourbé, la tourbe est caoutchouteuse, poivrée et marine, des notes pleines de caractères, chaudes et épicées et une légère réglisse
La finale est moyenne et tourbée

Note personnelle : 91/100

Vraiment très bon whisky qui malgré une forte tourbe propose tout de meme nombreuses autres saveurs. Un whisky complexe et plein de caractère"
4.0,"A really nice, moderately peated whiskey. Picked this up in Heathrow Duty Free for 85 USD for a liter bottle. Not a bad price, but not necessarily worth going out of your way in your travels for."

3.5,"50% abv
Natural color
Non chill-filtered

Nose: quite complex! phenolic peat smoke; vanilla; slight floral; slight earthiness; dried sweet fruit.

Taste: rich, juicy sweet and acidic, with citrus-laden bonfire peat smoke; chili pepper; honeyed-vanilla; slight fishiness; apple; brine; fudgy coffee; hint of spice and plum.

Finish: medium, with orange citrus; vanilla; cherry cola. A lingering sweet spearmint at the tail end. 

Value: Travel exclusive around $100 USD

Final thoughts: this is an interesting, young peated whiskey. Not a lot of depth but it somewhat compensates with its complexity. You could do far worst for a travel exclusive. All in all, enjoyable but overpriced.

Score: 3.5/5. Recommend trying or buying at a good price.

Malt musing: “Whisky is sunlight held together by water.”

4.0,"Another of the bonus samples from the SDT. This time we venture over to Islay’s northern shores to Bunnahabhain, where we have Cruach-Mhòna, a travel retail exclusive. Gaelic for “peat stack”, this single malt comes in at a respectable 50% ABV and is non chill filtered and natural color of medium amber. 

The nose is sweet billowing peat smoke...oh I love it already!  Sherry maturation is evident with sugary dates, plums, raspberries and blackberries. Cigar ashes, creosote, tennis balls and rubber...oh so good, a proper Islay profile. Vanilla custard, some polished oak, molasses, ginger and even a drop of teriyaki. It turns slightly to citrus with oranges/tangerines and a twist of lemon. The addition of water brings the berries out a bit more as well as the ashy notes. 

The palate is all sweet peat. Sherry and raspberries. Tennis balls and rubber, less than the nose but still present. Orange peel, licorice, almonds or maybe hazelnut and some well integrated oak. Water does little but lessen the intensity and produce a slightly bitter taste. Without water is definitely preferable. 

A medium to full bodied mouthfeel that is oily and creamy and mouthwatering. 
The finish is long, smoky, sweet(ish), with creosote and the smoke trailing on for a good long while. 

Other than the Ardbeg 23 that I had not too long ago, this is the first proper Islay I’ve had in a while. Oh did I miss this!  Really liked the nose, but the palate was a little less complex that I would have liked. I guess that’s a NAS, TRE for you though. At $100 I think it’s a little over priced (even for a 1L bottle), but I might be tempted to purchase it if I came across a bottle. Thanks to @Telex for the sample. A solid 4
Cheers"

3.0,"What we have here is another sample from, what I like to call, Bunnahabhain’s Unpronounceable Series.  This is a travel retail exclusive and I received a sample of this from my friend @Telex, after I traded this bottle to him for something else that escapes me right now.  He was gracious enough to send me a hearty pour so I can review it.

This is a deep gold in color with undefined legs that snake their way down the Glencairn after a vigorous spin.  It leaves behind tiny, watery droplets even though it’s bottled at a hearty 50% ABV.  I paid just over $110 for this 1L bottle from an online shoppe out of the UK.

The nose has lots of campfire and creosote smoke initially.  There’s a nice splash of red berries, but that charcoal note permeates the fruitiness.  Then I get a hit of an odd, musty smell.  It doesn’t belong at all- sometimes I get that same type of band aid note from a few Islay whiskies and I think it’s out of place.  It’s not off-putting, it just doesn’t quite belong.  Thankfully, it fades but so does the berry note- leaving just the smoke.

The mouthfeel on the palate is nice.  There’s smoky, earthy peat mingling with some fresh pastry notes.  Those delicious red and black raspberries come along again.  It’s a tad thick, especially for such a high ABV, but it works.

The finish is medium to long, but it turns quite harsh and leaves a good bit of heat from the alcohol lingering longer than I’d like.  The smoke is gone, the fruits are gone- it’s just abrasive alcohol.  This is where some well-aged whisky needed to swoop in and save the dram- but it doesn’t and that’s a shame.

Overall, it had a lot more potential than I think it capitalized on.  The funky nose and high heat finish really hurt this one on the overall score.  3 stars.  Cheers."
