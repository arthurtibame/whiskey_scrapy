2.25,"Bright nose. It's both syrupy and sharp, and that carries over to the palate. Floral and mild peat, sweet but gets drier on the finish. 7/19/19"
5.0,"2nd time trying this, revisited. A great dram full of flavor from floral notes, toffee, berries, peaches, pears, raisins, smoke, and a little chocolate. Having tried the Miyagikyo NAS/12 and Yoichi NAS/15/20, Is it me or is Miyagikyo smokier than Yoichi?"

5.0,Not so punchy like the yamazaki. Not so floral like the hibiki. Not so fruity like the hakushu. No peat or smoke. But very sweet warm. Well balanced and it's one of its kind.

5.0,"Very good whisky. Was fortunate to try this at a restaurant that still has it. Has a caramel/ butterscotch vanilla nose, fruity/caramel taste, and is very smooth. Pales in comparision to the Yoichi 15, Hakushu 12, and the Yamazaki 12."
