3.0,"Color is a reddish hue. Nose gives off a definite cherry scent, but you can still smell Whiskey shining through with notes of vanilla most prominent after the cherry. First sip is surprisingly and plesantly unsweet. There is a distinct cherry flavor, but it is not overwhelming. After the cherry, notes of baking spices, mild oak, and subtle vanilla follow. The finish is a little short, but pleasant. Overall, leaves you wishing for just a little more kick of the Bourbon, but not at all unpleasant."

3.5,"Nose: sweet maraschino cherry, very light vanilla

Body: extremely light

Palate: sweet cherry, wisps of vanilla

Finish: short

Note: very sweet, not much else going on besides cherry, a novelty whisky cool but not great. Not hot at all"

1.25,Smells nice: very cherry as expected. The taste invoked memories of milk chocolate covered cordial cherries. The finish went metallic and oily and really staid with me to the point that it made it difficult to taste anything else. Tried it in a whisky coke and the cherry did not work well for me.
2.25,Too much cherry
