3.0,"'Faint hint of peat' is right.  This is an easy-drinking whisky, which should be quite accessible to those who aren't peat heads (there is no 'moderate' peat here).  Cinnamon, caramel, orange, and a touch of saltiness are to be found on the nose and palate, with a hint of frankincense also to be found on the nose.  A much lighter, and much younger, bottling relative to the 10-year-old, but quite enjoyable."

3.0,"[Whiskey Live Paris 2015] Compared to the 10 year old, I found this overly salty and lacking in balance. Paired with salmon, it makes quite an impression on the tongue. Talisker and salmon were made for each other.  As a sipper, you're best off with something on the next shelf up (think Ardbeg)."

All'affumicato e salino tipico dei Talisker lasciano il posto il dolce e fruttato ma senza un giusto bilanciamento, sembra di bere un whisky dozzinale, da battaglia al livello di un J.W. Double black senza però essere un blend. Consiglio di usarlo esclusivamente per la mixology."

3.0,"The nose is sweeter than the 10yo. It delivers sweet and salted caramel, some peat and vanilla. Maybe pear and banana as well. It seems a much more tamed expression than the Talisker Storm and the 10 yo. Taste: sweet, peat and alcohol. Then fresh fruits, lots of caramel and vanilla with a dry peat knocking at the door every now and then. The finish is rather short for a peated malt. With sour and peated notes without to much oak influence. It is worth mentioning that the famous Talisker chilly catch is turned down substantially, which is surprising for such a young and spirit driven whisky. Here in Germany the price difference between the Skye and 10yo is around 5 €, so I will always lean to the age statement but this NAS is not a bad choice either. (81/100)"

4.0,"This is another installment in the sample set I received as a Christmas gift. As a fan of Talisker 10 (the first peated Scotch that really blew me away) I was happy to see what this NAS expression had to offer. 

I won't go into great detail, as I believe I need more than a 30 mL sample of this one to really nail the nuances, but it is sweeter from nose to finish than the 10 and seems to be missing some of that ""X"" factor that makes the 10 something I will reach for again and again. It shares some similarities with the 10 (peat, smoke, salt, iodine, fruit), but the smoke is a bit less pronounced and there is a slight added ash quality in the finish. The finish is shorter and lacks the lasting warming quality of the 10. 

This was nice to try, but I don't think I will try too hard to seek this one out for a more detailed tasting. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could, but 3 will have to suffice."

4.0,"My beef with NAS whiskies is a simple one - too many of them are inferior replacements for age statement bottlings marked up for way too high a price. Talisker, to their credit, seems to have found a better way - continue to release age statement whiskies, charge less for NAS (or at least fair prices...your market's pricing mileage may vary), and use the NAS expressions as a means of branching out and exploring other ways of living into their distillery style. Here, they pull the lever back on the peat to reveal another side of Talisker. Grainy sweetness, caramel apple - very bright and fresh - open up the palate before the signature pepper, sea spray, and peat smoke drift in. This could be a trainwreck, but it works quite well. It's not going to supplant the flagship 10 Year, or the Distillers Edition, but then again, it's also not trying to do that. It's just out to show you the Isle of Skye - simultaneously beautifully gentle and forbidding - through the lens of its signature malt. Well worth trying if you get the chance."
4.0,"Decided to do a 3 part tasting today with Skye, Storm and the 10 Year old, from the lowest to highest rating on Distiller. 

Starting with the Skye, on the nose you get a strong note of caramel, some smoke, and a hint of salt(water). 

Taste is caramel with moderate sweetness, some smoke, salt and a surprisingly strong bitter chocolate note. 

The strongest note in the aftertaste for me is salted caramel, sweet and sour. If THIS has the lowest rating of the 3 Taliskers I'm in for a good evening, because I really like this juice. Not a 5 star dram, but a bloody good effort. I'd say the 85 is deserved (everything above 80 is pretty much good anyway, so now we are comparing stuff on a higher level). It's a bit more expensive than the 10 year old, but we are still in the sub 40€ zone. Worth buying in my opinion."

Palate: some sweetness to the slight smoke. Baked apple and a little brine and pepper. 

Finish: medium short, teasing peat but mostly ashy oak, lingering saltiness.

Conclusion: not one to blow your hair back. It has all the good Talisker hallmarks (smoke, salt, sweet) but they seem far too dialled back. Though it pulls its punches it’s still a pleasing sipper, albeit one that doesn’t draw attention to itself. Good on Talisker for keeping it >40% ABV.

Taste: Pepper and honey - this is the first time it’s sweet to me. After a taste, I can find sweetness in the smell throughout,  but it’s retroactive.

Young already on the nose, where the influence of smoked woods is felt a lot and in a disconnected way, traveling on a pungent and invasive alcoholic note. Sweet notes of vanilla and cinnamon, lots of pepper (it's still a Talisker, anyay!) and a pinch of salinity. A not very organic mix, where in the long run only the sense of roasting and pepper remains.
Poured on the palate, still alcohol and burnt woods, prevalent spiciness and some notes of sweetness but less evident than on the nose. Marine character a little subdued, overwhelmed by the most determined hints that tend to cover everything.
On the finish remain toasting and spices, somewhat fleeting."

4.0,"Color: caramel, Nose: smokey (a piece of wood burning for several hours), Taste: smokey, sharp (little bit of napalm (no super afterburn)).
It combines very good with wasabi nuts and dry sausage"

4.0,"Expert review states “straightforward sweet, smoky, salty dram”. Cannot summarize it more accurately. More detailed flavors: something citrusy, smoked ham, peppered salami, then sweet honey starts to dominate. Smoke is also there till the end. Medium to long finish. Pleasant NAS bottling. Would certainly buy this again."
2.5,Woody on the smell. Very salty and strong mineral taste on the finish.

3.25,"Despite my dislike of the previous bourbons due to their profile they were quality drams. This sad to say is not. I think it's worse than the terrible 25 year i once had (solely a batch issue as 2 years later I had another which was great). That at least was a twisted promise of what could have been potential. This doesn't even try. It's like they got the dregs from all the crap barrels watered them down and flogged them off. Usually this would be a sub 3 score but it still has the magic Talisker profile I love however much it tramples over the reputation. Taste: its like a diluted ash tray had a baby with a bottle of honey mead and then tried to abort it and instead bottled it under the Talisker label. One good thing about it is it isn't terrible as such despite that description just really inoffensive and cheaply constructed. On a more positive note I managed to score a bottle of the fabulous Talisker 8 year special release,  sadly it's in Aussie with the relatives until either they or I travel to our respective places. 
Ok enough sampling for a monday night I'm going to round out with a tried and true Loch Gorm 2019 as a night cap. Oíche mhaith!"
