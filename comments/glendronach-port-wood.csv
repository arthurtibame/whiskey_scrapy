5.0,I like this more than the 12 and 18. I’m into sweeter casks so this is right up my alley. Intermingled berries on the nose with juicy port and sherry right up front along with fresh honey. Incredibly sweet and smooth finish. Pair this with a high grade dark chocolate and you’re in heaven.

4.0,If you like red wine and or whisky then this is the bottle for you. It smells like they put a little bit of wine in the blend. It has those classic sherry notes but then add even more rich dark raisins from the port. I can’t figure out if I should be having Italian food with it or be sitting next to a campfire. This is a unique must try whisky from Glendronach.

3.5,"A very farmyard nose: hay and and just a touch of sweet manure (!) Surprisingly soft in the mouth - fruity, sweet. A long syrupy finish."
