3.5,"I wouldn't say I'm a betting man largely because I bet on horses infrequently and badly. On this whiskey I would bet my house it's Caol Ila. It's nice, pleasant, agreeable but not exciting. Mild CI profile peat, vanilla etc. If you've drunk the 12 you know what I mean. It's very much like ground hog day with most bourbon barreled CI's for me (although some are definitely a step ahead than others). At $100 this is 3.5 for me. I'd plum for the 18 yr CI for a bit more $ but a lot better."
