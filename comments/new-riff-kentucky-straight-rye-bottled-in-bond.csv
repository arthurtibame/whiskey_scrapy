4.25,The nose on this is amazing. Palate is great as well. Medium finish.
4.5,"Neat.  Delightful.  Heavy rye on the nose.  I get marshmallow, mint,  floral.  Very little alcohol on the nose too.  Outside of maybe Willet, this is one of the best noses on a rye I can recall.  Nice creamy palate.  Hit of pepper on the palate transitions to some vanilla and spice.  The vanilla and spice linger.  There is a buttery quality to it as well.  One of my favorite Ryes.  On the spot I would put it right behind Willet as my favorite.  I’ll have to test this blind in the future."

4.5,"[6.25.2019] ADSA at the Hyatt in Cincinnati. This is an excellent rye for the age. Little pepper but spicy, some of the sweeter barrel effects like vannilins and tannins. This almost had a bit a cherry sweetness in the barrel flavor. Almost smooth but enough bite to prove the proof. Proud of the ""Nasty"" for making this whiskey. Colleagues over the weekend agree."

3.75,Sweet. But nothing I would spend a ton of money on.

4.25,"A truly well done and enjoyable Rye. Nose and palate deliver rich spice, vanilla, oak and caramel. None overpower each other, all in balance with a viscous mouthfeel and medium long finish. Cheers!"
4.5,"Rye's are my favorite form of whiskey. Immediately upon taking my first sip of this, it became an instant favorite and went into my top three all-time. 

I'm not sophisticated enough to get specific notes off this, but let me try to explain it. 

Subtle rye spice with decadent and balanced sweetness. Smooth as the fall leaves floating to the ground. No heat from that higher proof. Just good from the start to the finish.

This will ALWAYS be on my shelves. Worth the wait."

2.0,"Not sure it's fair to follow a single barrel with this but hey, that's life.  

Nose - rye spice over a really sweet vanilla and caramel. The oak is muted but it's there when you dig deep.  It has a nice baked goods note going here, really getting a lot of baked bread or pie crust.  

Taste - Rye spice, sour dough bread, vanilla, caramel, a bit of clay putty.  

I'm really happy with this one.  I think this is a hair better than their bourbon and again not a rye guy.  It's sweeter than some rye and their is a new riff oak note that's here for sure.  I don't love the clay putty note and it's a note you'll eventually get me to HATE on with a certain bourbon I'll get to eventually, but here it's not really off putting.  It's just not helping.  

I really appreciate this one.  Good oils are here, good body, it's a nice drinker.  A really solid 2 star.  For 40+ bucks  I'm not sure this is an easy one to stock up on for some as I mean pikeville is out there but I really enjoy this for what it is."

4.0,"Really solid.   Initial taste awesome, all the good rye flavors (vanilla, spice kick, etc.).  Longgg finish and spice lingers in a good way.  There is an unexpected cherry note at times at the very end.  I would appreciate this more if I liked cherry."

4.0,Really good rye. Great mixer.

5.0,Let's start by saying New Riff is making some good stuff. This pour has a rather sweet nose almost like a Vanilla Coke. The first sip is a blanket of vanilla with a light rush of pepper morphing to a slow simmer on your tongue. Brown sugar and vanilla dominate. This one never takes the harsh bite of many ryes and stays smooth like Lando Calrissian along the entire journey. I will go ahead and say what seems to be a growing consensus: New Riff is where it's at in the realm of fledging brands.

3.0,"Color: Dark bronze

Nose: Rye, dark chocolate, lemon pepper, orange peel, oak, mint, and black licorice.

Palate: Pepper, spicy, charred oak, orange peel, vanilla, and of course rye. The spice starts off as a cinnamon spice then within a few seconds the palate gets hit with strong rye spice.

Finish: Long, rye spice, charred oak and fading vanilla."

4.0,"On the nose lemongrass, pepper, and ginger. It’s not the strongest aroma but a complete lack of ethanol on the nose allows you to get your nose deep in there. 

Palate opens with Graham cracker and shortbread sweetness, transitioning to ginger in the mid-palate before finishing with white pepper and a good amount of rye spice. Flavors have decent depth and richness.

Finish is a shade over medium length, and it has a nice oily mouthfeel. 

Overall a solid rye with no major flaws. Proof point matches the flavors well. Bonus points for value as ryes of this quality are pretty hard to find at a $40 price point."
2.75,A very average rye
3.5,"Excellent bottle for the price.  Oak, vanilla, some caramel on the taste.  After letting it sit for a bit even more flavor jumping out .  For $40 a great pour.  Nothing to jump up and scream about but a bottle you can find and enjoy."

4.5,"Well done. Big spice and fruit when poured, mellows and vanilla as it opens"
4.25,"Nose - Vanilla caramel, light pine sap, sweet cinnamon, double bubble gum notes

Taste - Fruity vanilla, fruity spice, bubble gum sweetness, cinnamon oak, hint of pine sap, light piney bitterness

Finish - Lingering vanilla/fruity sweet, light tingle/heat, double bubble gum after all the sweetness is gone & you're just chewing pink rubber, lingering sweet pine sap notes

Score - 87/100

Final Thoughts - This one like the bourbon was quite interesting. I'm not sure if it's their mashbill or if they're using a special type of yeast, but I really get this bubble-gum note out of their distillate. It's weird, but not unpleasant. It's like they somehow managed to capture the ""cheap"" double bubble gum that is coated in loads of corn starch & gently infuse that into their stuff. This rye seems to combine all of that w/ this light pine sap that's not quite MGP rye herbal/mint/dill but more subtle. It's very unique but I'm not sure if it's my favorite.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - Maybe"
