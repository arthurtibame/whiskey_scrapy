4.75,"Great whisky. Oak is evocative, very evident but does not overwhelm the whisky notes and flavours. Nostalgic scent from Japanese Travels."
4.0,"A new Travel Exclusive from the Giants of Chivas Regal. This time a 18yo Japanese oak Finish in first fill mizunara oak cask. This is the standard 18yo finished in this ""water oak"" (as the translation for mizunara says) casks.

Bottled at 48%abv, it has a orange amber color. Nice. 

On the nose, this is not similar as the standard 18yo. The normal one is much more perfumed and orange citric. This one has a strong thick caramel note right away. Coffee. Very clean lemon peel. Dulce de leche, chocolate. 

On the palate, it is very smooth. Vanilla custard. Caramel. Sawdust. Very straightforward and smooth. No alcohol at all. 

Aftertaste is the best part. A beautiful tobacco note. Burnt oak. Wasabi and herbal spices. Very pleasant.

Overall, this is one fancy whisky. A little straightforward though. It is very different from the standard and can be enjoyed by anyone. 88 over 100."

4.0,"Pleasant and tasty, way more character than the standard 18 year bottling.  Water opens it up quite a bit and you can get more of the mizunara oak notes.  Well worth the money imo especially since it’s unfiltered and 48%."
4.25,"Nose - Clean sharp sweet, light honey, fresh blueberries, light apple juice, light caramel, balsa wood

Taste - Dark honeyed apple juice, hint of orange, ginger spice, dried berries, honey

Finish - Lingering ginger spice, apple juice, honey, dried apples, dried blueberries

Score - 85/100

Final Thoughts - This one wasn't as great as I thought it'd be, but it wasn't horrible either. Pleasant but kind of boring nose. Tasty palate, but nothing exciting. This was clearly meant to be marketed to please the masses and it shows. It's perfectly fine from start to finish, but nothing exciting and I'm not entirely what the First Fill Japanese Oak finish is supposed to add, but it wasn't much.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"
