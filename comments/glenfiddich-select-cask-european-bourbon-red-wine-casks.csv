null,"Still very glenfiddich, with the malt funk notes, but much more pronounced speyside-character fruits. Almost like a more premium monkey shoulder.

Apricot and marmalade mingle with the distillery character and finishes with medium intensity of lingering European cask notes"
3.5,"Color: Amber straw, light golden hue

Nose: Raisins and dried figs

Palate: Sweet apples and cinnamon fading to spicy notes. Light honey tones

Finish: Smooth, short, pepper and oak

This is an easy drinking scotch. I wouldn’t seek it out but wouldn’t be disappointed to receive a bottle as a gift."

Sweet all around.
Nose is full of notes, especially nuts and vanilla.
Palate follows the same way. Sweet the way I like. Good finish. I really like this one."

Sabor- suave y equilibrado, más intensidad de lo esperado, pero agradable en todo momento"

4.0,"NOSE: Pretty strong for Glenfiddich. A little salty and tangy. Toffee and sea spray? Maybe some grain toast.

PALATE: Sweet toffee, turns into cinnamon spice. Finish is minty and peppery. Pepperminty?

OVERALL: Much more powerful than you’d expect. Pleasant surprise."
3.5,"Seems too finished, too smooth. It's not a bad sipper (it's the only single malt on this cruise ship) but it's still a sipper that's lost its soul."
