3.0,"Nose: Initially very closed, but with time in the glass it starts to open up. A little bit of vanilla but the main notes I detected were woody tones - oak sawdust, both fresh-cut and old. Very carpenter's workshop. In the background there is the familiar clear sooty aroma I sense on almost all single grain whiskies, like charcoal briquettes. If I try real hard I can sort of get the ""bacon in maple syrup"" mentioned in the official notes here, but only just. Some oily aromas emerge over time.

Palate: Very gentle and smooth arrival that morphs seamlessly into a pleasant development that is slightly sweet.  White grape skins, oak flavours but no tannin to speak of ; fruit (pears, apples, lychees). A bright but agreeable sweet/sour note emerges very abruptly.

Finish: A surprisingly long finish that fades away pleasantly on the sweet-and-sour flavours.

The dry glass is almost entirely the sooty charcoal aroma, which is from the distillate. Everything more aromatic came from the casks and evaporates away.

I was surprised how moreish this whisky was and how much I enjoyed it, and for me it deserves a score in the 80s. At the price it is reasonable value and a valid alternative to a single malt.

The big competition to it is of course Compass Box Hedonism. For $10 or so more that offers a more forward nose, a bigger palate, better oak ... pretty much more of everything. However in its defense Cameron Brig does have a certain quiet, simple charm that Hedonism has lost under its layers of complexity. 

Tasted from a purchased sample. I'd happily buy a bottle some time but I'm not hurrying out tomorrow to do so.

""Above Average"" : 3 stars"
null,Not my favourite. Didn't do much for me.

3.0,"There isn't much happening here, which means you won't come to hate it. But you probably won't love it either. Aromatically, my best description would be: slightly salted maple taffy. It's nice, but it's also not much."
