4.0,"This same is from 1978 and has a bright gold color that leaves a jagged curtain of oils on the glass. The nose hits you immediately with a bouquet of caramel, vanilla custard, oak, brown sugar and a touch of cinnamon. The palate is very smooth and is heavy on dry oak, balanced by vanilla with touches of cinnamon and black pepper, with caramel and coconut following. The finish is medium with a lingering vanilla cream as the rest of the palate gently fades for a medium finish."
