4.0,"Great daily drinker. Oddly doesn't have a nose. Smooth. No complexity. I don't really get the ""rubbing alcohol"" after taste, though. Can't beat the price."

3.0,"It’s very sweet. Pretty mild oakiness at first with subtle vanilla notes as well. There’s a little bit of fruitiness, but everything is very mild. The finish is medium"

2.0,"For what is cost, not too bad as a daily.  Heavy vanilla and rubbing alcohol."

1.0,Tastes smooth at first. Very harsh rubbing alcohol taste on the finish. Would highly recommend you spend $15 dollars more for the Kirkland Blended 12 Year.
4.0,"upfront woody notes, oaky. Slight sweetness. subtle earthy, caramel notes at the end. low ethanol burn"

3.25,For $19 an bottle this is a good inexpensive whiskey you can pour a lot of.   smooth enough for me for the money.  I wasn't expecting it to taste like a 50 bottle of single malt haha
2.5,too sweet.. almost fruity?

2.5,"Nose: medium sweet malt, some sharp tannins that jump out at first, herbal vegetal note, hint of a ginger like quality, some fruit notes do push through a little if you let it sit, hint of honey, brown sugar, perhaps some vanilla. Taste: quite similar to the nose but with a little more fruit sweetness. Has a slight bitterness on the finish. Peppery notes with a hint of a fiery oak wood note, almost peaty but not quite. Overall, meh. If you like mixers with scotch, this could do. I’ve had worse."
3.0,"Yeah... well.., had this when I had Covid-19. Taste may have been a bit off. Wife got this for me out of pity at Costco as she thought it was Bourbon because “it was in the Bourbon section!”  Bless her heart. It was OK. Some fruity notes from what I could taste. Got the job done..."

2.0,"Great price but but the greatest drink.  I'm more of a bourbon guy that's trying to learn scotch but to me this is a beverage trying to figure out what it is. It's a little woody, not much nose, maybe a touch of peat but but enough to be up front. For me this is a well priced mixer, I doubt I will buy again."
