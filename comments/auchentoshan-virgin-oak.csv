3.5,Batch no. 2. I love virgin / first fill oak and I've had a few great ones recently (yes I'm looking at you Tullibardine 'Murray'). This one starts of with the right notes but there is a bit of an off one which runs through it. 3.5 and at $120 USD here in NZ.

3.0,"A pleasant whisky that lacks complexity, with faint floral notes and always-welcomed honey. Oak is the true superstar here (lumberyard was the first thing that came to mind when I blind tasted this). It's medium-bodied, with a palate that really highlights both the honey and wooden aromas. The finish is spiced and somewhat medium in length. Enjoyable, but not essential for the avid whisky collector."
3.0,5.5/10 Good. not great.
