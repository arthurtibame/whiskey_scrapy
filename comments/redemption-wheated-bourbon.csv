4.0,"Good nose, with burnt sugar, oak, and surprisingly lots of baking spice. This profile follows on the palate, with a slight floral note. Surprised this has no rye in it. Pleasantly sharp, but it has a smooth aspect as well, with sweetness throughout. Lingering spice and a woodsy bitterness. This is a sleeper. 9/9/18"

3.0,Was billed as “Weller Like”. Not bad but not as good as other wheated bourbons like regular Weller or Makers
3.0,"Decent flavor once you get bast the spicy bite. Smells higher proof that it is, same as the way it taste.you can make out some grain and i also got some apple and pear."

4.0,This is good. I’m a fan of wheated bourbons and this doesn’t disappoint. Reminds me of Weller SR but the extra abv gives it a little something more interesting. Price point might be a little high but a soldi addition to my collection of wheated bourbons.
1.0,"Like a flash in the pan, this was over barely after it started. Thin and weak, really nothing up front or on the finish. Only thing going for it was the higher proof."

4.0,Nose reveals some cotton candy and caramel.  Palate is caramel and cinnamon and very sweet.  Finish is short with a mild burn and some spice.  I like it.

4.0,"Sweet corn, syrup and some heat on the nose. 
Smooth and creamy on the palate. Very light on the tongue. 
Nice lasting finish with a little heat there also."
3.0,"""Wheated bourbons"" have become a hot trend over the past few years. So much so that many distillers are paying attention to this trend and making adjustments.
Deutsch Family Wine & Spirits owns the Redemption brand but actually sources from MGP out of Indiana, who distills for the brand according to their specifications. Apparently, this is a new recipe MGP started to distill in 2013 and since Redemption Wheated Bourbon is aged 4 Years that means all those first barrels are finally being bottled. The mashbill is 51% corn, 45% winter wheat, and 4% malted barley. That means if the recipe was tweaked just a bit to add more wheat and reduce corn, you end up with a straight wheat whiskey instead of a bourbon! Most ""wheated bourbons"" top out at 20% or 30% wheat in comparison.
On the nose there's sour fruit, herbs, vanilla, and honey. On the palate the texture is silky and buttery thanks to the high wheat content, vanilla, toasted nuts, bread, and grilled meat. Finishes with charred oak and tons of white pepper spice.
Apparently wheat actually gets better with extended aging and truly shines after 8 to 16 years in the barrel. This is obviously quite different from most bourbons on the market. It would be interesting to see how it evolves once older expressions start hitting the shelves."
2.0,"Starts with a bite (spicy) and has a lingering warm taste. Not a favorite but would have again. To clarify for Kirkgnomics, yes it gets a low rating but, I would drink it again, because, I’m not going to throw out the bottle. Not sure I would purchase another bottle though. I hope that clarifies my comment. :-)"

4.5,Fantastic. Has a lingering taste - vanilla? Possible Carmel. Smooth.
3.0,"Pleasing nose with crème brûlée and caramel. Sweet shortbread and white chocolate on the palate, with a bit of spice.  Medium finish. Best part of this whiskey is the nose."

4.5,I liked this far more than expected.  It was after a nice Manhattan so maybe that has something to do with it.  But this was kind of nutty and a sweet mild vanilla smoothness.  Super smooth and nice sweet lingering finish.

3.75,"This is good stuff.  The young age comes through slightly, but I really like MGP's wheated mashbill and this is no different.  Of the MGP Wheated Bourbon products I've had, the ones that come in at a slightly higher proof and age are better, but this is no slouch.

Despite being a wheater, there is a nice amount of spice throughout, with an overall pleasant smoothness and sweet warmth.  It reminds me a bit of a buttery cookie or toasted macaroon."

4.25,"Smooth from start to finish. Very sweet with notes of vanilla, caramel and leather on the nose. Flavor has just a hint of orange with a nice, but tempered oaky burn. Some more leather and tobacco on the back with a smooth finish. A bit of water kills the burn but keeps the sweetness but where’s the fun with no burn? At only 4 years, this is a wonderful addition to a neat bourbon drinker’s collection."

3.5,"Tried it first neat, then had a glass chilled. Preference is neat in a Glen Cairn glass, helps bring out the notes to add to the flavor. Smooth on the back end and not too spicy on the pallet. Has that great sweet caramel hint and doesn't overpower itself. Complex but not crazy. Solid pour, but the price point brings down frequency I will enjoy it."

2.75,"I've wanted to try this for a while as I've heard some good things.

Nose: Very sweet right up front, vanilla, poached apple, honey, some background yeasty fresh baked bread notes and a little bit of grassy herbal play.  Pretty but kind of plain smelling.

Flavor: Very plain.  Vanilla, light sugars, baked apple, very sweet like the nose suggests.  A little bit of funk that I associate with malted whisky.  Not bad but kind of simple.

Finish:  Medium long, quite a bit more spice than I expected.  A lot of dry barrel notes, black pepper, and a little bit of mint.

Overall not bad but kind of boring.  I'd say it's a poor value for the price.  If this were a $25-$30 bottle I'd be more on board."
3.5,"Way more interesting notes than Makers mark or even makers mark cask strength for a 4 year MGP. Bought this as it was reviewed to have  the same apricot and peach notes as 10 year old rip van winkle. I've only had a neck pour and yes it's sweet, mellow wheat. Hints of vanilla, oak and light chocolate  I'm not getting those same transcendent pappy fruits. Will let open a few days and see what happens. Nose is a cross between the sweet vanilla cream of the special reserve and the alcohol and floral of the antique 107 from weller."
3.5,"Now back to our regularly scheduled programming after some quick hit reviews. However, before we dive into this one if you will indulge in a quick story! My buddy @Neveruseice and I will frequently exchange thoughts and samples of Whiskey. When he doesn't like one out of the bottle I often suggest to him to add a splash of cold water to open it up. His response is always ""I can't taste any difference"". He then goes on to tell me that he doesn't understand how we on this app talk about tasting red fruits, honey, orchard fruits etc. ""All I get is Toffee, vanilla, leather oak and tobacco! To which I say, well your palette still has to develop to pick up those flavors for now stick to neat and never use ice (hence the name)! So for all of those who wonder what we bang on about in these reviews, you are not alone! Haha! Now let's get to the review!
What do we know? This is MGP sourced. It's age stated at 4 yrs old. It's a unique mashbill of 45% Red Winter Wheat, 51% corn and 4% malted barley. It's bottled at 48% abv. It also won the best small batch Bourbon at 5 yrs or under at the 2019 SF Spirits Festival to go with it's Double Gold Medal. So how does it taste? Let's dive in:
Upon entry it's rich with toffee and caramel notes initially but quickly transitions to coffee, black pepper and all spice notes. The spice swell carries thru the mid palette leading to a long black tea, fresh mint and clove driven finish. Black pepper comes back and bounces of the tongue. Slight heat too. It lingers for a while. 
All in all the more you sip this the more you like it. This is more of a Rye lovers Bourbon than a Wheated lovers. It's the spiciest Wheated Bourbon I have ever had. However, oddly it all works rather well. 
For the price I paid ($33) it's a solid purchase. Enjoyable. I see it go for up to $50. I would say $40 or less it's a buy. 
Nice job by Redemption on putting out an interesting, unique and affordable option into the Bourbon market! 
Cheers all!"

3.5,"The nose is mild with oak, sweet cereal notes, oak, soft baking spices, buttery caramel and molasses. The palate is smooth with oak, vanilla and caramel at first, with gently spicy baking spices following it. The mouthfeel is sweet and somewhat creamy but not mouth coating. The finish is medium with oak and vanilla sweetness fading nicely while baking spices keep the mouth tingling."
