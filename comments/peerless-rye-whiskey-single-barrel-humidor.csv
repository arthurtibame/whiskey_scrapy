4.75,"While the nose does not stand up to the peppery bliss of Michters 10 year rye, this still delivers a warning of the fun to come. 

Once it hits your tongue you immediately catch a cross of sweet cocoa and smoke that  morphs into a peppery burn as the nearly 115 proof whiskey says hello.

I have had a lot of ryes, including three Peerless single barrels, and this stands with the likes of Kentucky Owl Batch 3 and Michters 10 year. Admittedly the later outdoes this for me with the unabashed flavor assault, but I bought two bottles of 'Humidor' because it's a unique, great drink for any rye fan."
