4.0,"Nose- corn- marshmallows- banana 
P- sweet - marshmallow- leather - 
Finish- Carmel- all heat- wish it had been smoother or more flavor in the finish. 
Solid whiskey- shocked its TN juice. It was lived by many in our tasting."

3.5,Too much unbalanced wood taste. I can tell the flavor is there but the complexity is covered up by the up front oak explosion. Smells great with a decent finish.  Batch # 6 is better.
4.5,"Very good sipping whiskey 
Smooth caramel and vanilla"
