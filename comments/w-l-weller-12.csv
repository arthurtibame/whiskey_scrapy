3.5,Had both the 107 & this 12 year and though the 12 is rated 1 point higher than the 107 (ok so no real difference) I much preferred the 107. The higher proof didn't overwhelm the more complex notes.

3.5,"I picked up a bottle of this while in Australia. My assessment of this is that it is overrated. The first sip has a bit of bite to it but like as you drink it it mellows on the palate. The flavor profile is more one dimensional than I expected and lacks complexity. I expected a smooth complex bourbon with a semi sweet flavor but this is not any better than a bottle of Makers. I think the hype of Pappy has driven the price of this to a level that is not warranted, it just doesn’t taste like a twelve year old bottle should. I’m glad to have it in the collection but won’t buy it again."

4.0,"I’ve had the rest of the Weller lineup (Special Reserve, Antique 107, and Full Proof), but had yet to try the 12yr until now.

On the nose, I get sweet raisins, plumbs, baking spice, leather, oak and old books.

The palate follows through with the nose with similar fruit and spice notes, as well as leather and oak.

The finish is medium in length with some lingering spices and oak.

I enjoyed this, but had to compare it to its younger brother Special Reserve. They both share the same proof and SR is cheaper and more readily available. They are similar, probably the most similar of all of the Weller lineup. The 12yr is basically a more matured and more enjoyable Special Reserve. The fruit notes are brighter in the SR, where the 12yr they were darker and deeper. Similar spices, but more oak in the 12yr. 
Although the 12yr wins between the two, it is not worth $100+ more than SR on the secondary market or the stores that mark it up just as much.  If you can find it for a nice price, cool. Otherwise, don’t loose sleep over it."

Finish is medium-long and peppery with lots of oak, notes of brown sugar and cloves, and a bright herbaceous, almost bitter, note that makes me think of wood chips. It's not bad, but my personal preference is for the higher proof and bolder flavors of the Antique 107."

4.25,"Good oaky taste, the proof and balance is good. A little on the sweet side"
4.0,"BACKGROUND: William Larue Weller was one of the early whiskey pioneers in Kentucky and is often credited as the first to use a “wheated” bourbon recipe, which replaces rye with wheat in the mashbill.  The result is a sweeter and less spicy bourbon.

In addition to the Weller 12-Year, the other wheated bourbons within the line are Special Reserve, Antique 107, Full Proof, C.Y.P.B. (Create Your Perfect Bourbon), and William Larue Weller, which is an unfiltered, barrel proof offering in the annual Buffalo Trace Antique Collection. 

The line also included two discontinued varieties - the 90 proof W.L. Weller 19 Year that ended in 2002 and the 100 proof W.L. Weller Centennial, which was aged for 10 years and ceased production in 2009.

Though all of the Weller products are highly allocated and often the subject of predatory markups by retailers, the 12 Year is particularly difficult to find because it shares the same mash bill as the highly-desired Pappy Van Winkle line and is aged the same amount of time as the Van Winkle Lot B and almost as long as the Pappy 15 Year.  The Van Winkle barrels, however, are aged in the “sweet spot” of the warehouse.

NOSE: The nose presents a delightful marriage of citrus notes and the rickhouse small of oak, age, and undisturbed dust.  Though a bit ethanol heavy, it likely ranks in my personal Top Ten of bourbon noses.

PALATE: As you would expect from a bourbon aged twelve year, oak is the dominant flavor on the palate.  An abundance of fruit sweetness followed and even a bit of nuttiness that brings candied pecans to mind.

FINISH: The finish is a long one, but also very drying, which is common for bourbons this well-aged.  And when I say it is drying, I mean it seems to absorb every bit of moisture in your mouth.  The sweetness that was present on the palate develops into a burst of spice that lingers on the finish.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: Weller 12 Year is an extremely balanced bourbon that transforms from sweet to spicy as it travels from the front of the palate to the back of the throat.  It is almost as if the nose, flavor, and finish combine to tell the bourbon’s story without the need for words.  Retailing for roughly $25.00 for a 750 ml bottle, it is one of the best bargains in the bourbon world, which adds to its extreme scarcity."

4.5,"Vanilla and chocolate on the nose. Very similar profile to the Weller SR, just more ""grown up."" Holds its own on the palate. Sweet and syrupy. Definitely worth it's weight at retail, maybe not secondary prices."

3.5,"Weller 12. One of the most overhyped bourbons in my opinion. Considering the scotches I could get for the price of one of these, I am not impressed. Gave it a few tastings before writing this, and it did somewhat improve my opinion of it, but still, not worth it. 

Nose is slightly overripe apples, some vanilla, and the smell when you open the oven and the first waft of fresh baked cake comes out. That's what I get here. Not bad, but can be had for a lot less. 

Taste is somewhat vanilla, with apple pie, a few spices in there and some cinnamon. Reminds me a whole lot of Maker's Mark if I am totally honest here, and that one fell out of favor for me a while ago. I still like it, but it's not my go to at the moment. 

Aftertaste is some mellow cinnamon and warmth. Decent. 

Overall, it is not a bad bourbon, at all. What hurts it most is the hype and the resulting inflated price. If this would be a 50€ bottle, I'd be ok with it, but not for 90."

4.0,"Neat.  Open 6 months.  Been awhile since I explored this.  With Weller 12, the nose is such a big stand out.  The sweet out is so inviting and at such a low proof you can really bury your nose in it.  Sweet oak, burnt caramel, and baking spices is all there really is though.

Bit thin but also velvety in texture.  Taste mirrors the nose.  Sweet oak transitions to the caramel and the baking spices linger on the legs.  Leaves a heavy oak after taste that dries the mouth.

The more bourbons I explore, the less I love Weller 12.  The nose is great and the sweet oak is delicious, but it lacks depth.  The after taste can be a bit funky too.  I know the FOMO is strong with this one but it really isn’t worth secondary.  I prefer OWA."

향 : 
확실한 아세톤 향이 등장합니다. 그 사이에 밀크초콜릿이 박혀있네요. 밀납향이나 태운 설탕 향은 비교적 옅게 납니다. 코와 입으로 동시에 들이마시면 쌉쌀하지만 살짝 단내음이 혀에 부딪힙니다. 코가 어느정도 적응해서 깊게 들이마시면 메이커스마크에서 느껴지는 직관적인 아세톤+흑설탕보단 조금 더 정제된 향이 느껴집니다.

맛 : 
기대를 품고 맛을 봅니다. 가장 먼저 부드러운 실키함이 느껴지는데 그 실크 속에 스파이시함도 함께 있습니다. 12년 숙성의 정제된 젠틀함이 잘 표현됩니다. 질감은 의외로 물에 가깝습니다. 내쉬는 숨에 노아스밀의 페퍼민트가 느껴집니다. 향에서 아세톤+설탕을 느끼고 나서 맛에서 페퍼민트를 느끼게 되니 왠지 버번 종합선물세트같은 생각이 듭니다. 

입 안에서 굴려보니 쌉쌀한 스파이시함이 올라오는데 역시나 12년 숙성의 정제된 젠틀함과 45%의 비교적 버번치곤 낮은 도수 덕에 편하게 받아들이게 됩니다. 

피니쉬 : 
차분하고 웜한 느낌이 있습니다. 전체적으로 균형적이면서 절제되었음을 느낄 수 있습니다. 남아있는 오크향조차 부드럽고 은은하게 지속됩니다. 젠틀맨이란 무엇인지 잘 보여주고 있습니다.

4.0,"This is a 4 star bourbon for sure but it's certainly over-hyped and over priced and keeps it from being a higher score. Oak, sweet and ripe fruits are the most dominant notes on the nose. The barrel oak is what it is but the sweetness is honey, vanilla cream, corn syrup the fruit is also a sweetness of it's own with nice apple, peach, strawberries. Taste is the apple and peach with the heavy corn syrup and vanilla cream mid palate the light wheat and heavy barrel spice comes into play and the end palate into the finish is strong oak and some barrel char and bitter tannin. Finish is medium with the barrel char and tannin from the oak, and the fruit sweetness lingering on to the end. It's not almost 2-3 times better than the 107 Antique and certainly not better than 4 times the cost of the special reserve. It is cheaper than pappy 12, 15 or 20 though for the same new make."

4.5,It’s an awesome bourbon.  At $189 a bottle it better be.  There is a hint of something on the backend...oily/buttery...not sure what.  A special occasion drink for sure.

3.75,"Great expression from Weller. You can really taste the barrel age coming out in this bourbon. The 12 years adds leather, oak and almost a medicinal start. The finish isn’t as long as I’d hoped, but vanilla and cinnamon finish it off nicely. At 90 proof, I would recommend drinking this neat. No need for water as by doing so it opens it up to more of the barrel flavors (if that’s your thing, go for it). Cheers- this bottle shouldn’t be so hard to find. Scored at $65"

3.5,"These BT products start to blend together over time for me. This 12y brings familiar Weller scents to the nose - green apple rind, cherry, vanilla and caramel. Maybe apricot. 

Palate is round and smooth. Cherry and more apple. Some honey. Long finish. Slight waxiness. 

OWA > Weller 12 > Special reserve

Would pay retail up to $50.

I use the rating scale below. Distiller uses a scale of 5 and I use a scale of 10, but I’m sure you’re not too drunk to do the math! 

1. Disgusting - So bad I poured it out.
2. Poor - I wouldn't consume by choice.
3. Bad - Multiple flaws.
4. Below average - Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.
5. Good - Just average.
6. Very Good - Better than average.
7. Great - Well above average.
8. Excellent - In a league of its own.
9. Incredible - An all-time favorite.
10. Perfect"

4.0,"Neck pour (not really sure how that affects anything, but I’ve always wanted to say ‘neck pour’.)

Smell reminds me a lot of Maker’s Mark, but, dare I say, less intense. This does, however, translate to less of an ethanol whiff, so it’s a bit easier to pick up on the flavors. 

Caramel, cinnamon, vanilla and some juicy fruit flavors are discernible on the palate. 

Oddly enough, the aftertaste and the smell in the glass after the liquid has evaporated reminds me of Jameson Black Barrel. The same sweet, fruity notes are present, but this is much richer and darker than JBB. 

The reason I’m giving it 4 stars is based on comparisons to other wheated bourbons in the same (retail) price range. I’d drink this all day if I could find it at retail, but there’s no way it’s worth more than ~$55."
