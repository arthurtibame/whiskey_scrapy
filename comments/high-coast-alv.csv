4.25,"Nose: First impression is fresh, fizzy almost! More than a touch of lemons. This is followed by vanilla, melted butter and various floral notes that can be twisted and turned as you nose it. Very delicate, but still quite intense somehow!

Palate: Sponge cake, drained in melted butter and vanilla, without being too sweet. This is really good. Some minor bitterness, but not to the point that it’s disturbing. It packs much more taste than your average young un-peated whisky. Really great!

Finish: Medium in length. More vanilla, very pure. After a while there’s just a hint of white chocholate. Not quite on par with the nose and the palate, but still good. 

Overall: An excellent execution of a young burbon-cask matured whisky, evident of a competent destillate and the balls to let it show. The result is a delicate, yet rich and vibrant whisky. I score it 4.25 which is the mark of a great whisky."
