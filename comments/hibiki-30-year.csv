5.0,"Nose - Nose definitely reflects the age in you get hints of leather and sawdust. Traditional Hibiki notes of a very floral honey still exist, but over ripe pears and ripe plums make an appearance too.
Taste - Light spice, a very fruity oak. A bit musty like patiently aged wood, brown sugar and cinnamon roasted pear and apple skins.
Finish - Lingering sweet oaky bitterness. Faint dark amber oaked apple cider sweetness and a hint of aged muscat sweet-sour.
Score - 91/100"

4.5,"Very rich, smooth"
4.25,Pleasant. Nothing special. The Yamazaki and Hakushu 25’s are much more impressive.

5.0,"Golden sweet honey with crisp apples on the nose. Dark cherry and sherried notes hit my palate immediately, dark chocolate and just a wisp of pest. Mostly phenolic peat for me on the first sip. Adding a drip of water just brings out more honey notes. It’s more of the same with the drip of water for me. Adding more water just brings out the smell of the malt mash when you take the distillery tour. The hakushu brings dark baked apple pie notes, whereas the Yamazaki brings the darker chocolate and sherried notes all in the nose."
