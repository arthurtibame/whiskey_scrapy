4.0,Man it’s good. If you like wood and caramel this is your bottle.
4.25,"Dark brown with just a hint of amber.
Nose: chocolate, Madagascar vanilla, both heavily charred and fresh cut oak, subtle hint of sugar cookies.
Front is woody, followed by loads of chocolate and vanilla, warms the back of the mouth and finishes all sweetness and barrel.  
This is an absolutely massive bourbon, and not for the faint of palette. I had my first bottle a few years back, and didn't really know how to appreciate it.
But now I think it could be my favorite widely available purchase. This will remain in my cabinet always."

3.5,"Nose is very sweet. On the palate/finish not nearly as sweet, much more woodiness than anything else. Surprisingly not tasting much sweetness/richness, the oak dominates for me. Pretty good bourbon, but a bit expensive for the flavor profile I’m tasting."

4.5,"Woodford was one of the first bourbons that got me into this, so I had to give their Double Oaked a try.  I was skeptical though, given the $50 price tag. 
I taste the difference though.
Great taste consisting of chocolate and cherries with toasted marshmallow at the end. More full than regular WR and more ""woody"", double woody to be exact!
It's incredibly smooth.
Almost TOO smooth for my tastes. I'd prefer a bit more bite.
I enjoy this bourbon, but I really think it would benefit from a full barrel proof version."

4.0,"Unsurprisingly, a very sweet nose from the second barreling. Heavy oak, of course, but also a great vanilla scent. Maple syrup also peaks though.

The classic leather note I get on the palate of the base Woodford Reserve peaks through the oak bomb and the heavy vanilla notes again dominate; however, the sweetness in the nose doesn’t overwhelm on the palate.

The finish lingers for a good while. The dry leather mingles with a light amount of spice and once again the oak dominates.

I quite enjoy this bottle. It’s easy to drink and it isn’t overwhelming sweet like other twice barreled bourbons. It’s something I’ll keep around."

4.5,"Neat - A little hot on the nose at first, but drinks smooth. Halfway through a couple cubes of ice added. Nose was strong of vanilla. Still very smooth."
4.25,"Never start static I just get it off my chest. 
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest.
Take a small example, take a tip from me.
Take all your money, give it all to Woodford Reserve.

Sweet, surprising almost no burn. Short finish but it’s great. Would buy more."
3.75,"In addition to the vanilla and oak, the second maturation adds a chocolate note with a sweet marshmallow-y finish"

4.0,Very solid bourbon it’s exactly what bourbon should taste like. Not higher than a 4 because it’s nothing special from a taste but it does everything right.
