3.75,"I really enjoy the pineapple note, but outside of that it's not really dialed in. Would like to try the CR."
3.75,Kind of middle of the road nothing that stands out too far but still very good The banana and apricot kind of blend together

3.75,"For the std version I am aligned with @Richard-ModernDrinking in his review of the committee. A friend and I tried this for free on Ardbeg day at our local retailer. They served up pineapple chocolate and a smoked fish and potato dish. Both combinations went very well with the whiskey. It's almost like you are combining a lighter grooves version with a spicy pineapple fruit combo. I liked it but less than the Kelpie or in fact any of the previous releases in recent history. I'm noticing a steady decrease in my liking for the Ardbeg day releases over the last few years 4.5, 4.25/4 and now 3.75. The rum influence was very subtle and this wasn't a memorable dram. I notice the pricing at 120 usd was again poor value. Interesting I see the committee ranked lower than the std but I think it maybe the type of reviewer for each category i.e. the committee releases generally being  consumed by the more dedicated whiskey drinker."
4.5,"Nose: classic Ardbeg but restrained and dancing a continuously swirling waltz with tropical fruit and rich vanilla. Initially reminds me more of Port Charlotte. Classic Phenols, salami, campfire, salted limes, scented vanilla candle, charred wood, banana nut bread with chocolate chips. 

Palate: creamy, silky, slightly oily. Campfire ash, cordite/gunpowder, rich sweet vanilla, toasted coconut, fresh pineapple, golden raisins. 

Finish: black peppercorns, cigar, rum cake, vanilla cream, leather."
4.25,"Don't get me wrong, I like it... just not as much as the committee and I feel this is a little on younger now for some reason"
4.5,"Definitely similar to the 10yr, smoke up front with a fruity sweetness (didn’t taste pineapple, more of a sugarcane)
Overall pretty solid scotch for a rum cask"
4.25,"Initially similar to Ardbeg 10. Pale color, smoke up front. But much more on the palate and finish. Tough to pick out individual flavors but definitely some sweetness towards the end. Quite delicious.

4.0,"Like being on vacation in the Caribbean when the zombiepocalypse hits. You're running for your life through the burning pineapple plantation. 

You guessed it.. smoke and pineapple wave through your palate. Little bit of brown sugar briefly. Smoke is prevalent, but not overpowering. Looks like chardonnay in your glass."

4.25,"Nose : A surprising great balance for an Ardbeg. Fruits are plenty: apples, banana, pineapple. A small touch of smoke brings an interesting balance!

Taste: A classic Ardbeg taste. Smoke is powerful, malt also. Apples still stick out, but fruits are less present than the nose.

Finish : A smooth taste of exotic burnt/smoked fruits starts the finish, with powerful malt. The smoke than gets sweeter, and stays for a long time."

4.25,Very left-of-centre for Ardbeg. Did I just have a dram of Talisker/Talisker Storm? Very spicy on the nose. Overtook the normal smokey peat of Ardbeg I'd normally expect. Then an intense peppery peaty finish. Kind of Talisker Storm but on roids.

2.0,"Was drum the point where Ardbeg jumped the shark? Was the CR even better than the standard? Lets find out. Double review will be posted to both. Drum CR vs Standard. 

Nose - On the CR Bannans, oak, light smoke, candied cigars (I get this almost always on peated whisky but especially ardbeg).  I'm getting a bit of really young but used barrel oak notes. OK I'm getting similar notes here, but I'm getting more cigarettes. I'm getting more of a fire cooked fruit.  Yeah the CR is more vanilla/bannana and the non CR has way more going on. 

Taste - CR -  I do get the pineapple, the bannans, oak, vanilla, powdered sugar, light smoke, a bit of brine but not much. It's complex, it transitions, it does come off a bit young, but a lot of people want that on peat and actually it's really lacking the ardbeg peat punch.  The non CR is more subtle, clearly watered down, but I get more from it. Most importantly I'm getting just a lot more peat more Ardbeg. Yeah there's more brine, more smoke and all those things I want in an islay and they really make themselves noticed on the finish. 

Well put some water in the CR!  

Nose on the CR does change a bit, but it's still not as complex as the non CR. It's more burnt vanilla forward. 

Taste - water here makes the CR drink younger with more harshness and more of that banana and youthful oak. It does extend the finish and gives me more of an ardbeg profile of smoke. The non CR has more of what I think of as Iodine (but to be honest I've only known that flavor through whisky discussions so grain of salt on that please). 

Overall - they're the same score for me, but the non CR has a better nose and taste. The mouth feel however on the CS CR makes up for both short comings. Are these good whiskies? They're ok. 2.0 and frankly they'll be a weird one to discuss. MSRP at some stores near me were the same for each. A few even sold the CR for less when it came out than the non CR. Legit know a store that did 120 for CR and 130 for non CR. 

So this is the non CR review and I just have to add in here, there's something about the lower proof that killed it on the nose out the gate and this was the same view I had neck pours on both and now with both having been open a while. 

As an ardbeg fan boy I'm disappointed with Drum, but I don't hate it and I don't feel like I personally got ripped off, but I fully get why some people disagree. It is flat out too young for the price, especially the non CR which is 109.99 in ohio and I've seen in the 130's in Kentucky."

4.5,Starts off peppery but soon turns beautifully fruity
4.0,"this is the ultimate summer dram. I prefer it on the rocks despite typically being a neat fellow. 

Ever been to a bonfire on a beach looking back at the fruit trees as you realize the bananas are packing the pine into pineapples and you start to wonder if you've smoked too much or if you're about to wake up from it all?

 Here's your chance."

4.25,excellent light version of ardbeg
4.0,"N: Light and fruity behind peat smoke. Light for an Ardbeg. Pineapple. 

P: note of pineapple just after entering palette. 

F: very nice and long. 


Drank in the Ardbeg embassy!"
3.5,Exceptionally light and easy. A few drops of water softens the familiar Ardbeg earthiness leading into a tapering sweet finish.

2.0,"A bold choice makes a weird combination. Instead of meaty smoke making way for rich red fruit, Drum reveals secondhand smoke and a strange array of tropical fruits.

Nose: An old smokers hotel room, lemon peel, banana
Palate: Coconut, Papaya, Harsh smoke
Finish: Short and forgettable. Mostly lemon zest

Overall E for effort, but leave the rum casks for Balvenie"

4.25,Delicious. Great smokey notes and peaty finish
4.5,"Ardbeg continues to impress with this release. Huge impact of the rum casks comes out in both the nose and taste. 

Nose: Rich full bodied peat and smoke. Very rounded and robust. The iodine and rubber smell I usually get off Ardbeg is completely gone. Instead it is replaced by fruits and spices. Overripe banana, sweet apples, nutmeg, cinnamon, slight raisin and nuttiness. 

Taste: Spicy peat and smoke fades quickly into an extremely creamy fruitiness. I was immediately reminded of a more smokey Compass Box Great King Street Glasgow Blend. Cinnamon and nutmeg fade into a thick banana and apple flavor. The finish is pleasantly salty with citrusy flavors like lemon, ginger, and turmeric. Oily whiskey, flavors last a long time after."
