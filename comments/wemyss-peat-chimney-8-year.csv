3.0,"Not a bad dram, but not great.  Drinking the 40% ABV version.   

Nose:  Islay peat, slight fruity sweetness, malt.

Taste: Peat but on the ashy, slightly bitter side.  Some barley sweetness.  Very watery and poor texture.  The finish is short and quickly transitions the above notes into a watery nothingness.  

For $18, I'd expect nothing more."
