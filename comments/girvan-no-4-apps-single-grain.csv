4.0,"Big vanilla, malted white chocolate, and sweet creamed butter. Delicious. Almost no peat, brine or heat. Great starter-scotch."

4.0,"Не могу сказать,  что в восторге,  но виски очень не плох. Самое легкое,  что доводилось пробовать, с отчетливым привкусом пшена. Одно могу сказать,  однозерновой виски недооценивают зря."

4.0,"This one is very light, a pale straw or pear juice in the glass.  The overarching character is light, sweet, and airy, very easy drinking and with a relatively short, quiet finish.  Like a diluted mix of vanilla cream and apple juice.  It's of such a delicate character that it faded to very little when smoked with a cigar, unlike other whiskies I tried at the same time (Talisker Storm, Lagavulin 16, and Nikka Whisky from the Barrel).  I got several bottles of this at an incredible discount of $20 a bottle, where it felt like a great value as a mixer and gentle sipping spirit.  My review is pegged to that price; I'd look elsewhere at the $40-50 price point where I see this now.  At that high a price, it's a nice introduction to single grain but would only merit a 3-star rating."

3.0,Just ok for me. A light bodied creamy single grain whisky. Would be great to introduce people to whisky. I could enjoy this in the summer or maybe in a highball but doesn’t have enough depth for me to drink meat.

2.75,"Light golden wheat-y colour.
Butter cream, rich vanilla, wood and true white wine-ish aroma to the nose. It also has some distinct grain spirit aroma.
Same to the tongue at the start. Creamy, mouthfilling, candied and blanket taste with a true “vodka” finish at the edge of the tongue and on the palate.
Aftertaste is short and satisfying. A bit bitter on a palate. Some vanilla, wood and grain too.
It seems to really diverse to single malts or blended whiskies mostly by its ultimately different grain nature which gives something of a distinctive (again somewhat a candied) vodka style.
In second tasting it reveals even some steak meat tones to the nose."
