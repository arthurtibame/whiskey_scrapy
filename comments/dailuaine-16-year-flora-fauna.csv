4.0,"Fresh orange squeeze and hints of dried fruit on the nose. On the palate, the bright citrus note persists, but is counterbalanced with honey, toasted cereal and slight nutty note. The finish on this delicious julep is pleasently sweet but regretfully short. I managed to work around this problem by pouring myself an extra dram."
4.0,"82? Come on you guys! This whisky deserves more than 82! It's very good, and quite complex. The nose has wonderful notes of apricot, caramel and smoke(!). And though the body is a little lighter than I usually prefer, the finish is outstanding (a great closer). It's a hard to come by bottle, but definitely worth buying."

4.0,"Showcasing some of the lesser-known distilleries in the Diageo portfolio, Flora & Fauna gives you access to whiskies that usually go into blends. Dailuaine 16 is a Speysider with a singular style. Both intriguing and complex, the aroma features earthy sherry notes, plums and oranges, enriched by cocoa, dates and hints of rose water. Cherries, mint and emerging wood spices form the palate, supplemented by strawberries, herbal bitterness and a whisper of peat smoke in the lasting finish. This malt is definitely one of the best F&F expressions left today.

4.0,"Well, this is lovely stuff. Not life changing, not revelatory, but a nicely balanced bit of whisky. The nose is a bit of dried fruit, a bit nutty, and a bit citrusy, and a bit caramely - there seems to be some varied cask selection here, but it works. The palate, while a bit lacking in the flash department, is equally well balanced and friendly. You'll find most of what's on the nose on your tongue, along with the tiniest hint of wood smoke and a surprising coconut note at the finish. While initially short-seeming, the finish comes with a persistent plumminess that doesn't fully fade away for quite awhile. Yet another Flora and Fauna bottling that merits wider production and distribution!"

Tastes very strong of alcohol.
Ice brings the smell back and let's you taste the fruit. Slight hint of banana"

3.0,"Yeah, I know.  Announcing I’m tasting a Dailuaine is about as sexy and enticing as watching a kid play chess.   No, wait...I take that back.  I played chess in high school...more like wagered money over it.  Never lost a game.  Had a few people watching.  Granted...no one in the audience of approximately 5 kids resembled anyone like Jessica Chaistain or Priyanka Chopra.  But, I’ll take it.  Anyway, this isn’t half bad.  Fruity backbone.  Orange oil.  A hint of smoke.  A lot of waxy touches.  Almost elegant.  Like a Bishop’s Gambit disabling a Queen.    I bet this one is thinking “when I grow up, I want to be like Dalmore.  I wish I had a stag picture on my bottle.”"
4.0,"Versailles! Home of that tyrant and PR king Louis 14th. Top ratings to the Hotel bar for its selection of whiskey given it is French Cognac and Brandy territory! Ummm I like an underdog whats with Marcus rating this at 82? Deserves higher given its good value for money! Damn Brexit I say to the bartender an Asian lady who knows her stuff! NOSE: Apple Apple Apple crisp, I get the morning dew malarkey as well, gentle, nice on a hot day like this; PALATE: waxy, though not as waxy as how do you spell it Craigellechie, intensely spicy I mean Madras! Full bodied, sour apples, a hint of smoke, old wine gums; FINISH: medium to long leaving strong hints of stewed fruit, a little hint of bitter chocolate and then it’s done! A much under-rated and less well known brand but sitting here just minutes from a building that is Pre-trump but sickeningly Trumpian in philosophy which turns my stomach (the man not the building) this dram saves the day and reminds me that quality lies in the integrity with which you build your image and brand! Vive le Revilucion! Vive le France!"
3.5,"Nose: Sherry, dried fruits, aromatic pine resin, heavy vegetal notes, caramel toffee. Old fragrant oak furniture and cedar cigar boxes. Malty and nutty aromas. There's a trace of sulphur as well, but it works in the context. With water the nose lightens and gains more woody aromas [the dry glass is sherry and aromatic cedarwood].

Palate: Sweet arrival, a heavy sherry-based entry turning rapidly spicy. A heavy, viscous texture that focuses squarely on malt. Burnt sugar, oak tannins, milk chocolate, coffee and pine resin (but sweet). Christmas cake. Water melds everything together and brings out a mild minty note, which is very pleasant.

Finish: Medium/long.  Nutty, woody and sweet/sour malt.

On the one hand this whisky could be accused of being a bit banal and ham-fisted as it uncompromisingly lays on strata after strata of heavy aromas and flavours.  Subtle, this ain't.  On the other, it can be celebrated for it's no-holds-barred exuberance and body and it is a very satisfying dram to curl up with on a cold evening.

In some ways it's like the whisky that Dalmore could be if it tried harder. It could rival some Glendronach expressions and it's a bit like a younger, less monstrous brother of Glenfarclas 105.  It's also easy to see why Diagio values this distillery - the whisky provides brawn and depth of palate to balance the light aromas of their other house malts when used as core components in Johnnie Walker.

One of the best of the Flora & Fauna series (and increasingly difficult to find now). It's not a sophisticated dram, it's a bruiser and a good one that is equally enjoyable neat or with water.  The official distiller score of 82 seems rather mean.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"
4.25,"Wooho I'm done (for now). Yes that's right folks, four score and roughly 1 year or whenever ago I embarked on my virtual whiskey pilgrimage. Inspired by such pioneers as PBM, LeeE, GP, Telex, Scott E and others who were on a collective quest to sample all of Scotlands active distilleries I ploughed my way through 100+ open and closed distilleries (sometimes repeatedly). I took the Ben Saunders route vs the team Amundsen effort and unlike Ben made it! (Ok I'm not for one moment comparing my experience to crossing the entire Antarctic solo but hey I love to stretch a good analogy :-)). Now technically I constrained myself to those open in the last millennium as most of the young whippersnappers open in the last decade and a bit you can't get and yes Speyside I need to tick you off one day as I thought you weren't even a distillery (seriously who names a distillery after the region?) but I'm planting my flag claiming the glory and one day (later this year) I'll pick up my walking stick again and pick off the few new available distilleries + Speyside in a single night. Anyhow I think it's fitting I end on a Flora & Fauna offering as it sums up the spirit of my adventure well. A simple standard offering from a distillery...the type I mostly tried to aim for. Lovely biscuity caramel nose and palate, cherry (in a good way), sherry and much more going on. A bit thin on the finish but still at least a 4 maybe 4.25 given its perfect balance and one of the top F&F offerings out there."

4.0,"A take-home dram from Oban's upstairs bar, which has 5-6 of the Flora & Fauna lineup.  Diageo flavor maps place Dailuaine at the far end of the richness spectrum, even past Macallan and other whiskies aged exclusively in sherry butts.  That's a pretty accurate description, this is a sherry bomb to the extreme, and perhaps that's why it has to be moderated by the influence of other whiskies in a blend.  Medjool dates and cherries were the most distinct notes, so it's arguably lacking in complexity.  Nonetheless, I'm surprised Diageo doesn't release this one more widely, as I could see people who love sherried whiskies enjoying this one.  I can only imagine what a dessert it would taste like if bottled at cask strength."
