4.0,Sweet and spicy but very smooth. The flavour isn't complex but I don't think it was meant to be. For me the flavour disappears very quickly and doesn't linger very long. It is great value at around $30 after tax in BC for a 750mL bottle.  It should be noted that it is bottled at 35% ABV in Canada for the domestic market variant and is therefore technically no longer a Canadian whisky falling under the 40% ABV requirement. Nonetheless I still enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend it.

4.0,Great Whisky for beginners! Really smooth taste.

EXPERIENCE:
A very easy open you immediately notice artificial vanilla, artificial sweeteners a. A very easy open and quick finish, it disappears on your palate. Getting deeper into the pour you notice more elements of dried spices coming through with dried fig or dried plum. I highly recommend this rye, although not for drinking; it works excellently in cocktails if you're looking to punch up the sweetness without adding any other complexity. Sitting at 35% this is a very good introductory bottle to people just beginning to drink or, because of the simple flavour, those just looking to get drunk."
