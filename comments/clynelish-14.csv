4.0,"Well, starting the Memorial Day weekend and a well anticipated pour of this whisky that I have had for some time. It will open this long weekend (and very much thankful for those who have defended and protected our freedoms.)

The nose starts off as distinct aromas, almost as if you can pick each out out of an imaginary box. Those aromas consist of honey, candle wax, nutmeg, cantaloupe, Frosted Flakes, toasted marshmallows.  As it opens, the aromas begin to synergistically meld and the collective produces a savory sweetness.  More fruity sweetness comes forward. Pears, bananas, and pineapples with a touch of vanilla, candy corns sugar and a dash of cinnamon. Quite enticing. 

The palate becomes soft and velvety within a waxy body.  A primary sugary sweetness is encapsulated containing caramel, brown sugar and vanilla. There is a definite spiciness but not intense: White pepper and ground cinnamon.  Orange marmalade flashes briefly in the mid-palate and an oakiness begins the transition to the finish. 

The palate is left with some oaky char, cinnamon with a small amount of orange zest with a woody dryness.  This is all rather brief. 

This is a quality scotch with a fabulous opening.  The breadth and gelling of aromas is quite pleasant setting high expectations.  If the palate could match the strength of the nose, and the length of the finish was longer, this would be a powerhouse.  But unfortunately it’s not as broad and leaves you wanting more from the flavors. This however is still a flavorful whisky.  A staple for any collection. [$45][88/100][Tasted: 5/25/18]"

4.0,I get light peatiness on the nose (like if someone was drinking a dram of Laphroaig at the table behind me and I caught a whiff) along with a sweet maltiness and some fruitiness. The entry to the palate is quite sweet and light with vanilla moving towards citrus. The finish is pretty long given the finesse palate and starts with slightly bitter citrus moving towards a lingering sweet briny peatiness. A little bit of everything in this one.

4.0,"Known for its waxiness, Clynelish 14 is a Highland Single Malt primarily matured in ex-bourbon casks. Scotch mist gives an indication that it is non-chill filtered. Creamy honey, candle wax and lemon juice are prominent on the nose, while rich floral notes with a hint of peppermint lurk in the background. The arrival is warming and aromatic, unfolding a distinctly dry and oily character. Oak bitterness with a touch of salt dominates the medium-length finish. Altogether, it is an engaging and intense malt that requires time and is not suitable as everyday dram.

Honey check, unripe cantaloupe check (well to be fair its unripe something so I'll take his word for it :-) ), bitterness balances the sweetness but lingers too long in the aftertaste. This whiskey had the unfortunate privilege of coming 3rd after my tasting of 25 Caol Ila and 18 year talisker so whilst it didn't hold a candle to the former it compared favourably to the later. It had shades of the Tullibardine 20 - some viscosity + some bitterness. 3.75 and at $65USD here that's a 4."

4.0,"Nose: A complex and aromatic nose featuring a full, sweet malted cereal character and an aroma as of fresh clear sea air blowing over wet sand. There are some very satisfying oily fruity/floral notes as well (lychee, green grape, gooseberry) and a light floral scent like a herbal potpurri wafting from a distance. Some honeyish notes, like the smell of beeswax candles, which become stronger as it rests in the glass. Mustard and fresh-cut mint as well, and a long way in the distance there is just the faintest suggestion of smoke. Astonishingly, with all that going on the nose remains fresh and invigorating whilst simultaneously being oily and rich at the foundation.

Palate: Elegantly warm, spicy and slightly dry arrival with honeydew melon, unripe canteloupe, green apples and sultanas - mouthwatering. Sweet malty and cidery flavours begin to emerge after a moment accompanied by white pepper and a little freshly chopped stem ginger. Together with some oak notes this brings out a little tannic bitterness to balance the sweetness. The whole melange then softens gradually in the development towards a flavourful, waxy finale.

Finish: Medium long and slightly lower-key, but with a very satisfactory combination of oily/dry breakfast tea, sweet & sour spicy oak with barley sugar, and finally coconut flakes marinating in brine and seaweed. The only real fault is a tendency of the waxy-tannic aspect to drift a fraction too far into sourness.

Add water - a dash helps it to open this up. There are some passing similarities to Old Pulteney but I wouldn't call this an everyday dram. It is a very interesting and characterful whisky where the nose, palate and finish, whilst closely related and seamlessly transitioned, are all quite distinct. There is a delightful combination of marine, oily and mineral characteristics but they are in different combinations and show different facets throughout the experience.

Some whiskies are a symphony - this is Thelonious Monk. A wonderful nose and palate, and a good finish which is just fractionally less impressive.

3.0,"Clynelish's signature is supposed to be a slightly waxy texture and, perhaps because of the power of suggestion, I did notice that while drinking it.  I'm not sure if that's a product of the distillery's stills or whether it's just a function of its aging — having spent 14 years in the barrel, this whisky should have a respectable tannin base that may produce that teethcoating, drying effect.  On the nose, this is a very floral scotch, which brings to mind images of wildflowers blooming in the glens of the Scottish highlands.  The palate is a mix of honey, some melon, and floral overtones.  I've seen Clynelish described as a lightly peated malt but, to be honest, I didn't get that at all.  The finish is drying, like a white wine, and that waxy characteristic remains."

#14: Clynelish.  Single Malt Scotch.  46% ABV.  14 years.
Paid $70
Yes!  This is a bottle to re-purchase.

This is such a classic scotch.  Allegedly, Clynelish uses a wider cut during distillation that includes more foreshots and feints to create its fairly distinctive profile.  Immediately after pouring, this dram is waxy, woody, floral, and even musky.  With time and/or water, it becomes fruitier with applesauce and pears.  A moderate amount of pepperiness and saltiness exists throughout.  Peat is barely detectable.  The mouthfeel is famously waxy.  Clynelish is a staple of the industry because it is used to provide the robust base notes in many blends, most notably several from Compass Box.  As a single malt, it is strong in character but also is a versatile pour that will evolve in the glass.

4.0,"And so it begins: round 5 of our trading team.  This trading journey began over a year ago, when @LeeEvolved thought of this brilliant idea of sampling one item from every active Scottish distillery.  We’re five rounds in, with maybe two more to go.  In addition, we usually provide ‘bonus’ samples; items we come across which we think are interesting enough to share.  In reality, because of the guard rails on the official samples ( less than $100, most are averaging $50-60), it’s been the bonus samples that end up stealing the show.  We’ve had everything from locally available only craft whiskies, top shelf  Hibiki 21, Macallan Rare, and HP25, to mezcal, purchased in Oaxaca during vacation, made in an ultra-micro distillery run by a donkey named Chico and two guys.  So, now we’re starting round 5, this one provided by fellow northeastern’er @Scott_E .  I really liked this one... almost like a Balvenie 12, but better.  Waxy, oily, honey and heather.  Starts off like freshly baked bread, then goes into beeswax and heather.  I can see why Compass Box uses this as a base so often.  This is one of those that i’ll keep as a regular on my shelf.  One of the reasons I guess I liked this is because it’s “normal”.  After having recently Laphroaigs and Springbanks, this is a dial back to normalcy.  Sort of like coming back to good old home cooking after a week on a cruise ship.  Thanks @Scott_E"

4.0,"I’m down to the final, official sample for my group’s 5th round of distillery samples.  This is the Clynelish 14 year old.  This is a Highland distillery and it is the primary malt used by Johnnie Walker and now Compass Box blends.  It originally opened in 1819 and closed in 1967.  FUN FACT:  When it reopened in 1969, it was primarily used to make heavily peated malts during a devastating drought on Islay to feed the world’s need for peated whisky.  This lasted for almost 4 years.  Then it became the official replacement distillery for the then closed Brora.  Cool story and heritage.

This 14yo is matured in ex-bourbon casks, is bottled at 46% and is a beautiful golden, copper in the tasting glass.  It looks really oily and makes some quick running legs when it’s swirled up.

The nose is mostly floral with a nice dose of honey sweetness, candle wax and little to no oak barrel.  There’s a light peatiness that wafts in from time to time if you wait out an extended nosing.  The palate is hotter than expected, even at 46%, with a decent hit of cinnamon up front.  The waxiness comes in again mingling with green apples and bits of citrus zestiness.  The finish is medium length, oily with cinnamon and the first bits of oak I was able to detect.  An underlying, earthy peat hangs around, too.  It’s a quality dram from start to finish.  I can see why Johnnie Walker and Compass Box use this heavily in their base.  It makes for a solid foundation, even as its own single malt.

Thanks to my friend @Scott_E for supplying this one for the group.  I saved it for last on purpose and while it’s nothing earth shattering, it’s the definition of a scotch standard.  Bottle prices are reasonable, as well.  Buy with confidence, especially if you are just beginning an exploration of scotch whisky.  This is a wonderful place to start.  4 solid stars.  Cheers."

Finish:  Long, turning into a dry sour.

3.75,"The color in the glass is clear, limpid, of a delicious straw yellow (with the omnipresent, and in this case incomprehensible, caramel coloring).
On the nose the gradation is well present, although not high, but after a short ventilation the fruity hints arrive, with vanilla, citrus fruits, dried fruit and a pinch of salinity: not like an Islay whisky, but the position on the coast gives its contribution. Hints of peat and a pinch of waxiness.
In the mouth it is compact, elegant, after the initial onslaught of alcohol (which at 46 ° is not exactly a plus), the sweet and salty notes return, a pleasantly velvety and waxy consistency, caramel (not the one used to color it! ) and still the smoke, always light but present. The more you wait to drink it, the more different sensations overlap, a constant and silky evolution, very pleasant.
In the end, the marine note tends to prevail, accompanied by fruity and light (very light) peat hints, which accompany the palate for a not particularly long time."

4.0,"Now I know why Clynelish is used in just about every blend I can think about!!! Thanks so much for the sample @Scott_E! The nose brought subtle notes of hay, floral properties, and light fruit. The powerful palate is the best part. Huge peaches, tangerines, and nectarines. Heavenly heavy mouth coat, and the viscosity is beautiful. Slight smoky finish with oranges, apricots, and vanilla is a nice long length too. Since this is practically the ""bass player"" of whisky, meaning its a great foundation, we need a bass heavy theme to the dram. ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" by Metallica seems fitting. 4.0!"
4.0,"Stop number 77 on the SDT is Clynelish. Basically the successor to the soon to be reopened Brora distillery, this Diageo owned Highland distillery has quietly made a name for itself with this 14 year old single malt. Bottled at 46% ABV, and even though it’s not stated on the bottle it is non chill filtered. It does appear that there is a generous amount of colorant added making it a honey color. 

While coming off as “not as strong as you’d expect from a 46% scotch”, the nose shows a fair bit of complexity. Oranges, tangerine marmalade, beeswax and some cinnamon. A sanded oak table with a candelabra slowly dripping wax down upon it. Floral with dry grasses and faintly herbal, oregano or sage. A sherry type nuttiness even though I believe it is all bourbon matured. Lots of vanilla comes through with some caramel and brown sugar. Creamy. A very light mint and a brief hit of cumin. Odd as it may sound, there is a fresh laundry detergent smell. It works though. A whiff of smoke even though it is unpeated. Not a powerhouse of a nose but quite enjoyable. 

The palate arrives silky smooth with a waxy/floral/fruity burst. Orange blossom, tangerine, creamy vanilla. A little pepper, maybe white pepper and a light oak. The palate is less complex than the nose and quickly transitions to the finish. 

A medium-light bodied mouthfeel. Oily, waxy and mouth coating. 
The finish is medium length. Waxy, slightly bitter. A little oak with some spices. 

I really enjoyed the overall waxy sensation throughout the whole experience. It’s a lighter, mostly easy drinking whisky but it really works well. The finish is a little off but doesn’t hurt it too much. I have to applaud Diageo on this one. Choosing not to chill filtered was a great move. I would love to see this at 48%. At $68 locally it’s a good price for its age. We’re the finish a little better it would be a solid 4. As is it’s a 3.75. Thanks to @Scott_E for the sample. 
Cheers"

O14 is like eating French Toast on a warf on a foggy day .... C14 is like eating the same French Toast but on a warm, sunny day and eating it with a little spiced butter and meyer lemon on top. There’s more punch than O14 and more highs/lows in flavor - earthy coriander mixed with some waxy honey and pings of lemon which adds some nice dimension. This is a warm-you-up whiskey; a good way to start off a night and prepare your palate for an adventure."

4.0,"Clynelish 14

Nose: on first approach there is a strong presence of over-ripe apples. But, as you begin to dig deeper there is a classic heathered honey note you expect in Highland malts, peach, and a little briney sea water. And then it happens. This lovely backbone of earthy peat. Not quite medicinal. More woody and earthy and meaty. Its not Islay or Campbeltown strong. Or even Talisker. But its there, like slipping on an old field jacket on a brisk Fall morning. Its soft, comforting, reassuring. With more time in the glass some dark fruit and sherry notes work their way out like wisps of smoke escaping from a dark caldron...slowly revealing its secrets bit by bit. 
Palate: Its medium weight on entry. Not watery, but not as oily as a cask strength. Some peppery spice tickles your cheeks and a little warm encouragement as it goes down. Wildflower honey comb, vanilla, beeswax, allspice, cinnamon, bitter orange, walnuts, raisins, and swirled inside is this vein of peat funk that delivers this cured meat savoriness balancing the honey and sherry sweetness. Think country ham smeared with grape jam in as far as that salty meat and sweet fruit strike this delicious balance that us true Southerners know 😉. 
Finish: lingers lovingly with dry leather splashed with vanilla, peach syrup and cream, baking spice, and a earthy wood note."

4.0,The heart malt for JW Gold this highland is known for its waxy texture and feel. It does not disappoint. Poured neat the nose is fruity(lotsa pear)and malty with candle wax and toasted barrel. Palate is true to nose adding honey and some floral aspects to round out. Very enjoyable mouthfeel. Im sure Im subconsciously interjecting more waxy notes than are really there but hey it works for me. Finish is nice malty dry barrel and lingering fruit with a whisp of smoke. This is along the lines of Craigellachie13 with the fruity malt and meaty feel. Not quite the equal but close........90/100

4.0,"A waxy, floral nose of red plums, tangerines, pears, malted barley and a glimmer of peat. The palate is rather balanced, a delicious dance of sweet, fruit, salt and spice, and a sherry-like note, orange peel, dried raisins and nuts. Somewhat dry, medium finish, walnuts, banana peel, just a good balance of oak, spice and a touch of brine."
4.0,"Pronounced ""Kline-leash"", the distillery is owned by Diageo, best known for Johnnie Walker. Supposedly, this distillery is heavily leaned upon in Johnnie Walker Gold Label Reserve blend. This 14 year old expression was first released in 2002.
One of the most unique things about Clynelish is the oily and waxy texture on the tongue. It was discovered that this texture came from the oils that collected in certain parts of the equipment during distillation (the feints receiver for those familiar with such things). Normally, those oils are removed when the equipment is thoroughly cleaned during the annual ""silent season"" of the distillery. At Clynelish, these oils and gunk are kept and added back into the equipment in favor of retain this specific texture and mouthfeel.
On the nose you get pear, flower blossoms, and salted caramel. On the palate you get hit with the highly unique oily and waxy texture, black pepper spice, fruit blossoms, fresh uncut grass, and sea salt. It finishes pretty long with caramel sweetness, floral, and almost seaweed character. Excellent pour!"

3.75,"Nose: First sniff says mud, or clay even. Then rubber and some oil. Then comes sweet fudge and vanilla. Quite different! Very far from being fresh, and fruity/floral - I kind of like it.

Palate: At first sip some bitter ashy notes, but they soon turn to salted caramel and thick fudge ackompanied by some dirty waxy notes in the background which reminds me of a mechanical workshop allmost. (The ”waxy” quality was expected based on other reviews I’ve read, and though I do pick it up, I may note have pin-pointed it as such had I not read the other reviews.) Overall I relly like the taste, which like the nose is very far from being fresh. I would not call it balanced, it’s on the verge of being a bit too salty and the fudgy caramel is sharp. But it is tasty!

Finish: The salt lingers, forming a plesant sweet/savory mix. The rubber-like notes from the nose can again be sensed. Just a tad of milk chocholate can be noticed. Overall the finish is on the shorter end of medium in length. 

Overall: A bit rough, un-fresh, shorter finish than I had hoped. But still really tasty and different. I score it 3.75, which in my book equals a really good whisky, and a bit of a must-try being low on peat but still far away from a gentle Speysider."

3.0,"This review is for a bottle from 2017

It’s easy to forget what a classic malt Clynelish 14 is.  This one is famous for its honeycomb flavor and waxy mouthfeel.  Everything else is made to be soft and subtle.  There is a light smoke, medium orchard fruits, and medium oakiness.  The balance is nice.

But it just doesn’t stand out for me, and at $70, I feel I overpaid.  I used the last pour from this bottle to see how it compares to a 14 year old from a distillery rising in the ranks: Arran.  The Arran is better, easily.  This Clynelish is mostly ex-bourbon maturation, but some sherry influence is detectable against the razor precision of the Arran.  The little hint of sherry used to create a well-rounded experience for the average Scotch drinker just muddles this one into the realm of forgettable drams for me; and this is sole standard bottling from this staple distillery is far inferior to the many independent bottlings and Compass Box blends featuring Clynelish that are out there.

Score: 0 (forgettable)

4.0,"Bought this a few years ago while on sale at my local liquor store and stuck at the back of my cabinet. Finally opened it a few weeks ago.

The first pour wasn’t that good and I felt a little let down by it, but a few drams later as the level dropped provided a better evaluation and revealed its true character.

Sweet honey with a hint of orange on the nose. More of the same on the palate but mixed with some fruits, malt, nutty flavors,  and a whiff of smoke. The finish is medium in length with some spices and toffee coming through. Bottled at 46% ABV, it certainly can take some water which tones down the tongue tingle and opens up the sweet fruity notes at little, but it’s really not that hot, and I enjoy the higher ABV and the tongue tingle.

Probably not for someone fairly new to scotch as it’s quite complex. It’s a little pricey for people who prefer to shop in the sub-$60 range, but if you are happy to buy scotches in the $70 to $80 range then this is a must try."
