3.75,"A hint of brown sugar, caramel, and of course port wine. Not overly sweet or spicy. Very neutral, but with a port overtone."
3.5,It’s young but you definitely get the rye taste with light spiciness and the port finish does sweeten it up a little. Solid intro and I’m curious to see what a more mature bottle would taste like.
