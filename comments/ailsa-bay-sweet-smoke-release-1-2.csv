2.0,"Ailsa Bay is a Lowland distillery owned and operated by William Grant & Sons and is used to produce whisky in the style of Balvenie.  WG&S opened the old Girvan site primarily to make whisky for their blends and reduce their need of Balvenie and Glenfiddich malt.  They also switch runs and produce a peated whisky several times a year.  This is their newest, peated release:  Sweet Smoke.  This is also release number 1.2, whatever that means.  The PPPM level is 22 and they also have assigned a weighted number to the SPPM (sweet parts per million):  19.  So, now they have created a new way to quantify flavor?  Yawn.

This release is straw gold and makes tons of watery legs and large drops in the taster.  I don’t believe it has been chilled filtered, nor do I think color has been added.  It’s bottled at 48.9% and I paid around $60 for this online out of the UK.  Ailsa Bay does not release any malts in the North American market.

The nose had a really high, minty peat note:  menthol and eucalyptus leaves lead the way along with tree bark and the faintest bit of honey.  The sweetness isn’t very noticeable on the nose and there’s little to no cask influence either.

The palate is also minty and bitter with youthful spirit driving the bite.  There is some nice sweetness from honeycomb and vanilla, but I have a hard time believing there’s an actual way to quantify it with a specific number.  Holding the liquid on your tongue causes it to function more like a mouthwash than a whisky and the watery feel really pushes that home in a bad way.

The finish is short with almost no lingering notes.  It does feel a bit more oily at this point, but the bitterness really had me scrambling for some water to wash away the acetone flavor.

I think the biggest problem here is the whisky is just too damn young.  I’m assuming it’s under 4-5 years of age and I think maybe Ailsa Bay should just focus more on producing blend-able juice and quit with the single malt bottlings.  That’s just my $0.02, though.  This was a tough bottle to finish and the inaugural Ailsa Bay I had a year or so ago wasn’t something I’d seek out either.  This manages just 2 stars.  I’d recommend looking elsewhere for non-Islay, peated whisky.  This stuff is rough.  Cheers."

3.25,Very sweet. Expected a lot more smoke. Reminds me a bit of Johnny Walker Gold with peat. Best when slightly chilled.

2.75,"Nose: A pleasantly soft bonfire-style peat-smoke with some sweet citrus and stone fruit notes hiding in the background. Not a lot more but what is there is well done.

Palate: A mild peaty and sweet citrus arrival, very much following on from the nose. A little sweet hay, vanilla and light cereal tones appear as it develops. Some green apple flavour peeks through towards the finish and adding water considerably develops the sweet malty and fruit notes. The texture is agreeable.

Finish: Medium, but very abrupt. The sweet citrus and orchard fruit notes fade first and the smoke lasts a little longer - then stops dead in its tracks as though a light switch was flipped off.

This is a brief note as I tried this at a local liquor store today and didn't have a lot of time to dwell on the tasting (but at least they served it in a glencairn).

Very young in profile, but pleasant nonetheless. It has precision but limited range and seemed rather contrived, like it was built from a kit or painted by numbers. It lacks the messy but delightful complexity of a more traditional whisky and it reminded me of some peated blends I've tasted.

However the only real fault I found was in the finish which was perplexingly curtailed. One moment it's there, then suddenly it's gone.  One notably good thing is that there is no intrusive ethanol presence - I would have sworn that this was 40%.

I'm glad to have tasted it but even on special ($85 down from $99) I wouldn't buy it - maybe if it was half price ...

""Average"" : 2.75 stars"
3.5,"All smoke on the nose. Warm big flavor all the way through. Smoke on the finish with a little burn. There are hints of sweetness that I like, alone with something kind of cinnamony. I’d buy a bottle."

3.75,"Sweet smoke but hides in the complexity of the whisky, oakiness, vanilla and dried fruit. Not as alcoholic as the abv suggests"
4.5,"2019 lowland whisky of the year is not always a super great price, since there are only a handful of distilleries in the Scottish lowlands. A relatively new distillery, that uses peat in their expressions. Can the lowland resurrection be true? Lets see...

First, this is a technological whisky. 

What???

Yes. This bottle has a new anti-piracy system that lets you know exactly the cask, the year and the batch of the bottle, giving you the capabilty to say ""this one is not fake whisky"". 

Bottled at 48.9%abv. Amber color. 

On the nose, Peat smoke very dim. Pineapple; Very sweet yellow Apples, Fresh apple juice. Juicy, fruity with hints of smoke, Very interesting. Most accurate pineapple aroma note ever.
Lemon has appeared after a while. Very, very fresh and juicy. Peat has become earthy and peppery after a couple of minutes. Apricot after first sip with some saltiness. Pretty complex. 

On the palate, it wasn't as complex but fairly good. Peat, Toffee, Ashy, Bonfire; Caramel but very watery. Last sip was all toffee.

Aftertaste has a nice peat kick. Sulphuric, Burnt grassy fields. Salty and smoky. 

The pineapple gives it a tropical feeling overall. The empty glass smells like pineapple marmalade its amazing how accurate that aroma is. Overall this is quite surprising and i truly recommend it. 91 over 100."
3.5,Strange nose. Sweet and peaty with some spicy finish

3.5,"Nose: Sweet, gentle smoke.

Flavour: Quite sweet flavour, more smoke than the nose gets, comes with a bit of a sharp hit.

Finish: Smoky, quite long."
2.5,The 1st release i was not a fan of. I ordered this by mistake..so it was placed in the crap pile. It us a worthy member. Initial hit is a jumble of sweet lightish peat but the aftertaste..blargh
