0.25,"If you've ever baked an apple pie, and had it boil over in the oven,and then thought, ""Wow! I would really enjoy licking the bottom of the oven out after that cools down!"", then this whiskey is perfect for you. It's cloudy, it's syrupy, it's licking the bottom of a recently cooled oven while someone shakes a canister of cinnamon over your face. Enjoy!"
