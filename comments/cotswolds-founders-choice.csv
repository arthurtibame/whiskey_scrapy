On the nose it has dark chocolate and rich red fruit with a nice subtle hint of wood spice.

Palate is surprisingly oily and rich with cereal and a sweet honey and red fruit. 

Finish is long and spicy with nuttiness and a plenty of dried fruits."

3.25,"Like the lower proof releases from the distillery, this packs a basket of orchard fruits into its flavor profile. But the punch of the alcohol means the higher strength detracts more than it adds and I didn't have a big enough sample to experiment with water. If you like Cotswolds (and you should) and you have the constitution for high octane whisky, this one might tick all your boxes."

4.0,A great whiskey. RIch and fruity.
4.0,A little strong but bold flavor. Strong nose but pleasant. Definitely does not need water but a few drops did improve it for me.
3.5,"Acetone on the nose masks fresh roasted coffee beans, white pepper, tart crust and currant jam. Palate is pleasant to start with the fruits getting stronger but the pepper escalates quickly. Dry, tannic, peppery finish. Adding water tones down the pepper and highlights the pie crust/baked goods."
