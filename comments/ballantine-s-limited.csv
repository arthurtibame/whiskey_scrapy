3.75,"A higher abv expression of the traditional Ballantine's that gives it a little more depth in flavor. 

Bottled at 43%abv.

On the nose, very straightforward. Vanilla, custard cream, Cookie Dough. Mostly sweet.

On the palate, Vanilla, Herbal spices, Tea, Chocolate, Caramel and ""melcocha"". Aftertaste has a ginger note mixed with puffs of smoke. 

It is your typical Ballantine's with a little more power. Overall, this is a 78/100 dram."
