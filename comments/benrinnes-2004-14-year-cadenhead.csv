4.5,"One of the reasons I frequently can’t be bothered with cask-strength whisky is the very reason many people like them: that you can experiment with dilution. More often than not I want a drink, not a chemistry experiment, and futzing with water just feels too much like homework. Sometimes, though, it’s worth the effort. This 14-year-old Benrinnes from Cadenhead was tight and stingy with its flavors at the bottled strength of 56.4%. But diluted to 46-50% it opened up like a moonflower, unfurling a perfume-like nose of lemon puff biscuits, cream, custard and malt. Those creamy notes continued in the mouth, with an oily texture and a sprinkle of spice. The finish is medium length and rich on the cream. A delicious introduction to this distillery and a cure for any lazy drinker’s aquaphobia."
5.0,"34 years into life and this is the best I’ve had to date. Colleague brought a bottle back to the U.S. straight from the distillery and I gotta say, I’ll never forget that man for allowing me to taste this. Smooth with a deep flavor, no overbearing peaty flavor or aroma. I imagine the quality of this drink will haunt my tastings for years."
