4.25,Great fruity/green apple nose which complements the port barrel really well. Tastes like the distiller had the finish in mind when they made it

4.0,"Love the nose- first thing I got was dark chocolate with rasberries/ red berries, then honey, some oak and a good dollop of caramel. Tatste wise it was fruity with some vanilla, mint, red currants but all very quick, it seems this is not the main part of show everthing vanishes to be replaced  a medium to longish finish of oaky spiciness with a metallic tang (whisky showing it's youth perhaps?) and waft of charred smoke. I like a lot of what's going on, but a little disorienting a ride."
