3.5,Spicy notes on the nose. Sweet and spicy tones  on the palate making the rum cask again noticeable.

4.0,"I enjoyed this flavorful blend. Delightful sweet nose, the taste starts in harmony with the smell but has a lingering smoke at the end that was unexpected but very welcome. Nice slow burn, very little harshness."

3.75,"Most pleasant budget Scotch I have found so far, friendly vanilla and rum spice notes. Very approachable and fun for a beginner to scotch blends"

2.5,"The name should be ""Taint's Scotch"" Taint smooth, taint scotch, taint Dewars. A strange frankenscotch that combines the harshness of rum with the roughness of young grain whisky scotch. 

Look, I'm not some malt whisky elitist. I like a fine blended scotch any day of the week, and I really like Dewars 12. But as a Scotch goes, the Caribbean Smooth just doesn't work. It's at best a half step up from Dewars white label, but so is a hot cup of vinegar with a pair of dentures floating in it. 

The juice here is rather rambunctious, uncouth, blend that is part scotch and heavy rum. It's rather impressive really how the rum character comes though.

Now, if you're the type that's into making your own drink creations, this has some interesting potential because of it's hybrid nature. But as a sipper, even on ice, it's a bit of a confused mess. The good news is that it's only $22 a bottle. But for the money, I'd rather get Chivas 12 or Monkey Shoulder."
3.5,"Nose:  sweet, earthy, honey, mild spice, mild peat 
Palate:  sweet, smooth, spicy
Finish:  short, spicy, sweet 
Surprisingly good for the price ($21).  None of the off-putting notes that are sometimes found in a blended scotch."
2.75,Decent for under $20
1.5,"Definitely not my style. The rum cask adds a sweetness, but just didn’t jive with me"
3.75,It’s very basic but for $21 a bottle you won’t find an easier sipper
4.5,nice drinkable whisky

1.75,I get a sulphuric note in this that is reminiscent of bile. I’m assuming that it is just me. I can’t get past it though.

3.75,"That's how you do a rum cask! You keep the original grainy stench, but add light, not mouth-coating sweetness. Very drinkable."
