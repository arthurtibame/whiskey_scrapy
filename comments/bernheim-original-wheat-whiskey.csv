4.0,"Brought this home for Ryan from NAILE 2014. Sweet, yes. This is honey, vanilla and a little bit of sugar and yeast. Tastes a lot like my in-laws' French bread fresh out of the oven. But this is a loaf of bread that got lit. Faintly yeasty gives way to subtle oak. I hope this is what OYO tastes like in a few years after aging more properly. A damn fine whiskey, well representing the wheat whiskeys. Well worth the wait."
4.0,"As I smelled the whiskey I had notes of oak and sweet vanilla toffee. At first taste the full notes of wheat come across the pallate. Very sweet in flavor that settles in and stays. The whiskey is a smooth, easy drinker that I could drink all night."

4.0,"Smooth and Sweet, this Whiskey lacks oomph. You can really run a magnifing lens over what the Wheat Brings to the mashbill. Palate has Vanilla Pudding, almost like tapioca, and a faint honey note. The nose is well finished but ephemeral, hinting at what this could become with a little more time in the barrel. This is pleasant and delicate, yet could be more assertive. It is reminicent of an Irish Whiskey, in its light, unobtrusive profile."

3.0,"My first wheat whiskey.  Definitely smoother and gentler than the traditional corn or rye based, but not as complex or full of character as some of the barley based single malts.  Overall, a really easy sipping, great for a lazy hot Saturday afternoon.  Really can't go wrong for the price either---just over $35."
3.0,Good upfront wheated bourbon with loads of flavor.    Finishes in a very unique fashion with a large oak flavor.  Unique and easy to drink.
3.0,"Smooth, good wheat flavor and clean but nothing terribly crazy. Perfectly enjoyable glass."

3.0,"Nose is mild, with hints of fresh bread dough, vanilla, and a bit of alcohol burn. Palate starts off very smooth and decently rich, with vanilla, honey, and light brown sugar, and then goes pretty much nowhere.  The finish is smooth and very slightly dry, with a floral hint at the very end.  This juice is incredibly one-note, and while it's an interesting change of pace from everything else, it just doesn't have enough to keep me interested past the first sip.  The closest comparison I can think of is a very, very light Irish, (Knappogue is a good example) but without the light fruit, and far fewer floral notes.  Worth trying once, but not what I'm looking for in my dark spirits."

3.0,"(Note that this is a review of a ""Small Batch Store Select"" bottle, from Kensington Wine Market in Calgary, Canada--never-mind any questions about how the hell a ""Small Batch"" can be store selected like a single barrel).
  
  A nice, albeit soft smell, which I guess is what to expect from a wheat whiskey; a mix of Wheaties, banana bread, slight cherry, perhaps a touch of mint and some cherry Kool-Aid powder. Vanilla cake frosting. Slight breadiness or cookie dough. Taste is--again--light, an initial soft sweetness, more bread. Slightly wheaty, light cake batter, vanilla. Something evocative of an ex-bourbon barrel Speyside Scotch. Chocolate milk powder? Honey? Somehow I get a bit of cornmeal or cornflour despite the absence of corn from the mash. A touch of banana esters. Finish is a bit hot, dry. Slight vanilla and wood char. Nougat, maybe? Not terrible, but aggressively mild in flavour (aside from big, surprising heat in the finish). Super mellow, even without ice or water. Perhaps a nice warm-day summer sipper by the campfire, but there's not enough here to keep the attention of a whiskey fan."

Finish - Relatively short, slightly bitter oak, the pineapple on the nose makes its appearance here, but very faintly.

3.0,"Woody toned color, with a tinge of orange.  Sweet floral tones, orange, candy apple, and almonds on the nose.  The taste comes off as slightly nutty, and then strolls along the tongue revealing juicy candy notes. It reminds me of gummy worms and cherry fruit snacks. The finish is engages more gushy fruit snacks and spice.  This whiskey is definitely candy!  Easy drinking that I would recommend for beginners and the casual drinker. I wouldn't even bother with water or ice."

It is worth sipping as the flavors of oak and the malt from the wheat come out if you let it roll over your palate. It really grew on me over the night."

For the price this is a pretty solid wheater. Soft vanilla and brown sugar upon entry. Mid pallette feature sweet oak and some orange peel. Finish is more vanilla , toffee and oak.

Not much taste at first, then develops a surprising oaky iodine with a little burn neat.  Very sweet, the burn would be gone with just a little water, leaving only vanilla sweetness.  Rich and toasted cereal grain.  A thin buttered toffee.

Gentle heat on the finish.  Slightly bitter, but not off-putting.  I do get a bit of the characteristic Heaven Hill peanut essence there at the back end.

Nice.  Not sure if I prefer it to Makers or Wellers, but not sure I don't either.  Easily worth a try for < $30."

2.0,"Have had this before, but I had to try this again after having the Parker's Wheat. Actually, the nose is similar. Obviously not as intense, but ish. And pleasant in its own right. Deep honey. On the palate, it starts off like the Parker's but that ends pretty quickly, and likewise the finish is short. There's a similar honey note, but this definitely is not as intense or deep, and unfortunately it's more bitter than I was expecting. It feels creamy. There's a hint of vanilla on the nose but none on the palate. Some herbal notes. Bravo for the addition of an age statement, but this seems younger than 7 years. I understand this is going to suffer in comparison to the Parker's, but I think even if I hadn't had the Parker's front of mind, I wouldn't be thrilled with this. 6/27/18"

4.0,"Nose: On the nose I get immediately the charred oak from the barrel interior, a nice macho whiff to start the drink off right. As it has time to stretch it's legs in the glass for a bit (Ha) I also get dandelion and wildflowers along with vanilla ice cream, and randomly carrots. It's a delightful bouquet, no arguments from me!

Taste: The palate starts sweet and friendly with honey. Notes of grain cereal like Chex or Crispex stand out. And (country folks may get this more) you know when you're walking outside and you pick a dry stalk of grass to put in your mouth? There's that taste: a grassy / straw in your mouth taste. And there is no finish to speak of unfortunately.

Opinion: You know, I don't see many wheat whiskies. Bernheim claims to be the first, so well done there! I think this dram isn't challenging at all except maybe for the slightly higher alcohol content (45 abv), but dang! It has some complexity alongside the friendliness that I can see making this a good dram to have paired with a pipe on a nice night and a few good friends shooting the breeze. Cheers!"
4.0,Very nice whiskey.  It is smooth but deceivingly hot and spicy. Very buttery and toasty.  Toasted oat is a prevailing taste. Think Honey Nut Cheerios for the really grown up!  I am not a fan of typical assertive boubons with smokey undertones or finishes.  I am not a rye fan either so this fits the bill nicely!  Really good stuff. Only $24.95 in NC for the month of June 2018. What a deal.

3.5,"American whiskey tasting evening, Sydney, 21 September 18. Whiskey #1

Nose: Fragrantly floral, vanilla essence, pine resin, honey and buttery notes, cereal grains and some oaky toffee.  Adding water brings out some rather leaden brown sugar and tends to collapse the nose.
    
    Palate: A full spicy arrival with some mild sweet ginger and bitter orange marmalade. A fruity note, a little nuttiness and some grassy, minty flavours. Water makes the palate harder rather than softer, amplifying the spicy notes too far and unbalancing the whiskey.
    
    Finish: Medium/long. Toasted cereal, bread and some woody notes.
    
    Generally speaking it has a soft and approachable character, but it's not as sweet as some comparably priced bourbons can be. The character is dry and it's softer on the nose than the palate, which turns woody as it develops.
    
    There's a cantankerous spicy note running through it that is both an asset and a fault. It lends complexity and interest, but it's a simple aroma/flavour that becomes too dominant if water is added. I'd recommend taking this whisky neat.
    
    I tasted this as the first whiskey in a flight of six at a liquor store tasting evening, and it was a great starter. I came back to the glass throughout the tasting and it held up pretty well against the following (much better) drams, although by the end of the evening its simplicity was becoming obvious.
    
    At the price in Australia this is just barely value for money, but it's definitely worth a try at least once. It rates a solid 3 stars and I might even buy a bottle some day if I find it on special ... but not today.

4.0,"This was one of the first brown spirits I purchased, so my first review is fairly primitive (though still accurate). Thought I'd re-review a little more in-depth. 
APPEARANCE: Pours into the Glencairn a light copper color and develops skinny, fast moving legs after a quick swirl.
NOSE: Dry, dry, dry. Dry wheat toast. Dry grass. Dry, dusty oak. There is a sweet sugary note in the background that just eludes description. It borders on floral and reminds me a bit of wildflower honey? The longer it is in the glass, the more prominent it becomes... and the more crazy it drives me that I can't identify it.
NEAT: Thin mouthfeel. Comes in sweet with Vanilla and Honey. A hint of Coca-Cola, maybe? A good dose of oak. Slightly hot and finishing with bitter oak notes and mint clinging to the palate. I occasionally get a hint of cocoa.
SPLASH: Really ups the sweetness. The Cola note is definitely there now. Still a touch bitter on the finish, but less so. The dark chocolate really is more assertive on the finish as well.
VERDICT: An excellent whiskey! Not the most complex, but I really enjoy it. I'm at a loss as to why I haven't had it in so long. Bernheim is delicious in a rocks glass with a large cube. Sweet and Oaky with a definite chocolate note on the finish. This could definitely be a summer time sipper. Kudos to Heaven Hill for this unique age-stated product. I would love to see special releases of this in the future. Single Barrel? 10 Year? Cask Strength? Store Picks? So, Heaven Hill, if you're listening......."

Little bit spicy towards the finish but not super strong. Pleasant spice stays on tip of tongue.

Adding 4 drops of water tones down the sniff but still pleasant. Flavor and notes are muttled but very pleasant still.

Absolutely favorite bourbon under $30 in North Carolina."

3.5,"In a world where age statements are becoming increasingly scarce, Heaven Hill sticks to solid numbers for many of their whiskies.  This one is a 7-year product.  Notice how I haven't called it a bourbon?  It's not.  It's a whiskey composed largely of wheat, breaking the rule that bourbon must be 51% corn.  To its credit, that big change in mash bill produces a dramatic difference in its flavors.  It's incredibly sweet and filled with ""high-register"" flavors, if that makes any sense.  It's almost icy in its profile, with a chilled citrus flavor that's reminiscent of orange popsicles and ice cream.  The age comes through in a wood-cabinet varnish accent that helps give this some tannic grip.  There aren't many dark, brooding bourbon flavors here, but it works pretty well."
3.75,Ultra smooth first hit with a tingle on the edges of the tongue.  Good flavor but not as full as a fine bourbon might have.
4.0,"Bernheim Original Wheat Whiskey is the first new style of American whiskey since prohibition.  The mashbill must consist of 51% wheat.  The mashbill for Bernheim Original Wheat Whiskey is 51% wheat, 37% corn, and 12% barley.  From what I can find, there are only a handful of wheat whiskey’s out there.  This one does have a 7 year age statement on the bottle which is a plus now days.  The color is a nice amber color.  The legs are thin but do not run to fast down the glass and after a while the just cling there.  The nose is sweet with lots of vanilla, caramel, and honey.  The taste is vanilla, caramel, some oak, and a touch of spice.  The finish is fast with hints of oak with a slight residual caramel sweetness.  It is very light and easy to drink whiskey. This would be a great choice into whiskey for someone new. To me this is very similar to other wheated bourbons."

3.25,"If you have a friend who is hesitant to drink whiskey neat due to limited experience, this is a perfect starter. Since the market is extremely limited for wheat whiskey, I compare this to the drinkability of Maker's Mark and Larceny. All 3 are widely available and sub $30. Bernheim is smoother and lighter than either due to higher wheat, which is why I recommend it for beginners. 

Oak is most prominent on the nose, due to the 7 year statement. I also smell caramel, but keep in mind everything I'm smelling is subtle. The taste is equally light. All of the flavors I see in reviews are mild at best, including the oak and alcohol. This whiskey basically disappears on the tongue. I barely know I had a sip of it 10 seconds after swallowing. It is honestly impressive how light and drinkable a 7Y whiskey can be. But that's not what I want these days. I see value in this, especially for $29 with its age statement and uniqueness. However, it is boring to drink and I'm having a hard time finishing the bottle because I always want to reach for something else. Buy this for your friend who drinks whiskey on the rocks or Crown Royale straight, I'm sure they'll enjoy this."

3.0,"Oh the rabbithole a person can go down when trying to trace history of a particular whiskey!
What we have here is Bernheim Original Kentucky Straight Whiskey Aged 7 Years.
On the nose there is brown sugar and vanilla sweetness with citrus and blackberry. On the palate you get the same flavors with cinnamon, oak, and candied orange peel as well as wheat toast. Medium finish with black pepper, burnt sugar, and more toasted bread. This is something different versus the usual bourbon and rye that is coming out of Kentucky and is much appreciated.
The history behind the label is a bit tangled and takes some research to unravel. Bernheim Original was first released in 2005 with the 7 Year expression sometime after. The label is actually owned by Heaven Hill and is distilled at the Bernheim Distillery that Heaven Hill acquired in 1999 from Diageo along with it's DSP-KY-1 permit. This was the result of a fire in 1996 at Heaven Hill's original facility in Bardstown that almost completely destroyed their plant (DSP-KY-31) and about 90,000 barrels of aging bourbon. Jim Beam and Brown-Forman stepped up and helped Heaven Hill to use their capacity to continue to produce until 1999 when they acquired Bernheim Distillery in Louisville and now all production for Heaven Hill occurs there. Aging, bottling, and shipping is all done at the Bardstown location."
2.5,"Here goes, hoping for a little bit more characters than the Woodford wheated whiskey. The body is pretty thin and the legs are pretty quick. Color is a medium amber.

The nose honestly doesn’t offer me much. I might get a little lightly toasted oak and green apple.

The first sip is pretty smooth, but also pretty bland.  The flavor is almost bittersweet in a way. The second sip brings around a little bit more leather and caramel with maybe a little bit of raisin in the background? Still no burn, and no spice as one might expect with a wheated whiskey.

Revisited this last night with my father in law.  He like it, which is generally a bad sign.  Actually chewing on it I got a LOT of smoke and char this go round.  I missed it at first - probably cuts any sharper oak flavors to keep it smooth but gives it an unbalanced funk that doesn’t play as well with the lighter grain notes.

Still don’t love it but wish I did.  Gimme Larceny any day over this one as it layers much better (still not saying much)."

3.25,"Bernheim Original Wheat Whiskey is a Heaven Hill Distillery offering that launched in 2005.  It's claim to fame is being ""the first new style of American Whiskey introduced since Prohibition"".  I don't dabble in wheat whiskey too often, but I wanted something to compare to a recent travel pick up (Oregon Spirit Straight Wheat Whiskey; see my next review for this tasting).  It's named after the Bernheim Distillery, and by extension, Issac Wolfe Bernheim, an important player in the early Kentucky bourbon scene.  Contrary to almost everyone else in the industry, Heaven Hill first produced this wheat whiskey as an NAS offering and later added a 7-year age statement.  Cool beans.  

Mash Bill: 51% Red Winter Wheat, 37% Corn, 12% Malted Barley
Age: 7 years
ABV: 45%
Price: $29.99

Nose: Soft, light, and mellow.  Aromas of bread, light syrupy cherries, and vanilla combine to give the impression of something akin to cherry vanilla scones or cherry jam cookies alongside some faint buttery corn.  Sweet and very fruity, with a light cinnamon spice.  The ABV was so well hidden at first, you could stick your whole nose in the glass if you wanted to, but it slowly makes itself known as it opens up.

Palate: Honey sweetness and very soft.  Lots of white bread, cherry syrup, vanilla, and cinnamon, with dashes of toasty oak and corn husks.  Those could sound like fairly typical bourbon notes (minus the bread) but the light mouthfeel, simplistic profile, and straightforward delivery tell you otherwise.  It's satiny, has little astringency, and doesn't pack much heat or spice.  

Finish: Medium length.  Sweet and satiny, with a bit of cinnamon spice heat.  In a surprising turn, the barrel char and oak hangs on the longest, but it doesn't veer into unpleasant, over-oaked territory.  

Overall Impressions: This dram doesn't scream character.  In fact, it's so softly spoken, it doesn't scream much of anything.  It's like the economical Macallan 12 of wheat whiskey.  But if you're in the mood for something light, mellow, and very easy to sip, it does offer good VFM for a 7-year age statement whiskey for under $30.  I'm fairly certain I would reach for this over the similarly-priced Woodford Reserve Bourbon (sorry for picking on you Woodford, I'm just finding you too musty lately).  

With the exception of the soft mouthfeel (even then, I'd call Berheim's 'satiny' and Oregon Spirit's 'velvety'), this is different enough from the Oregon Spirit Straight Wheat Whiskey I'm trying it alongside, it almost feels a bit unfair to compare them. However, I did have an easier time scoring this dram, probably because it didn't stand apart so much.

3.75,I’ve heard this is better than Weller but I have never had Weller so I can say. This is very good though.

2.75,Almost odorless. Taste is very mild and a little anise forward. Smooth but not my favorite.

3.0,Very smooth for a straight whiskey!  Pleasant flavors that complement my cigar..enjoy
4.5,"The nose has hints of toffee, and some spice. It has legs, but the taste isn't overly oily. I am not great at identifying flavors, but I can say the balance between spice and sweetness is one of the best I have had in a while. The finish retains a hint of spice - very nice."
3.75,"Pretty soft on the palette with a very short finish. It's almost gone as soon as you're done with your sip. It has all the oak you expect from a bourbon (and then some) with a little more sweetness on the front and less on the back. Overall, pretty mellow."
4.5,"The nose of the bourbon features playful notes of toffee, vanilla, and toasted bread, with the slightest hint of banana.

On the tongue, this whiskey tastes sweetly of buttered toast that transitions into cask oak and vanilla.  There is a spice to the drink that enhances it and developes into the finish.  It settles into a pleasant, if mild, glow in the chest while the spice lingers on the tongue.

Excellent neat."

5.0,first wheat bourbon I have purchased. While touring Heaven Hill I had my first experience with a wheat bourbon in the form of larceny. I greatly enjoyed this so I decided to give this HH 7 year expression a shot and it was delightful!

3.5,"Butterscotch and bananas on the nose, nice pepper on the front dries quickly on the tongue and leaves a light oak and horseradish finish."

3.5,Definitely sweet! Not too bad of a bite. Some burn.
3.0,"I get oak and vanilla on the nose, plus something similar to clove as well.
Soft honey, vanilla, again a touch of clove then a bit of a spicy kick at the back of my throat.  Not a burn, but more of a quick spike of spice then fades quickly.   Ending a smooth slightly sweet/honey woody finish."
