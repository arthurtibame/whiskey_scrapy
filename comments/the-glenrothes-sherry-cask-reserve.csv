3.0,"I want to love this whiskey, I really do. The sherry dimension is pleasant and the spices are wonderful, but unfortunately none of it comes together. The nose has a surprising touch of vanilla which is unusual for a sherry cask, and your typical touches of fruits are largely absent here, except for a faint hint of raisin somewhere. The body is full sherry and predominantly spicy, but quite disbalanced as a whole. The finish is somewhat long and pleasant, but ultimately only decent as a whole."

4.0,"Just having a relaxing evening, watching the Last Samurai, and needed a whisky to go with that. Something to sit back and relax with, not too strong (hitting the shooting range in 9 hours, not trying to get wasted tonight). This fits the bill. Light, friendly, not too complex, but still tasty. Nose starts with plums, some cherries, decent malt notes, some dark chocolate on the back end and some raisins mixed in there. All things you'd expect in a sherried Speyside Whisky. Taste is dark chocolate, some malt, dark fruits to compliment that all, a bit of bitterness for contrast and very little sweetness surprisingly. Almost like unsweetened dark fruit tea. Finish is chocolate and fruits, nice and unchallenging. This is  a solid speyside sherry. Could maybe use a bit higher proof, but most 80 proof whiskeys could use that."

3.0,Good for the price. Sherry is there but not overwhelming. The oak shines through. Caramel. Dried fruits. 3.75

3.0,"Thanks to Matt, I got to sample this one.  I've not had many Glenrothes before, maybe one I think (bourbon cask).  This makes for a really good daily dram----a smooth honey profile with baked pie crust and chocolate.  Finish is slightly bitter, but a tad bit of water calms that out.  I'd highly recommend this to a newbie in Scotch.  Very non confrontational, smooth and with a bit of depth because of the Sherry cask."

3.0,"Nose - Mix of dried & fresh stone fruits, caramel, strawberry jam.

Taste - Fairly thin mouthfeel, strawberry jelly, hint of milk chocolate, caramel, raisin, orange zest.

Finish - Light cinnamon heat, watered down strawberry jelly, light caramel.

Score - 72/100

Final Thoughts - Mixed feelings about this, nose seemed pretty plain, didn't have that dark musty stone fruit odor of an older aged sherried Scotch but had more vibrant & fresh aromas. Seemed fairly thin, mostly on the sweet side. Not much different on the palate except it seemed a bit more muted than the nose and then very quickly disappears on the finish. Nothing really offensive about this one, but it's just a little boring for a sherry finish. Not great, not bad, but not memorable.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

4.0,This one is perfect for when you don't want to break the bank but still want something decent. Straight forward sherry flavours which work very well with the cigar I'm smoking right now (Placeres from Honduras). As long as you don't expect anything to spectacular you won't be dissapointed. Cheers!

4.0,"2nd dram from my bottle, I've added some drops of water this time. Much better compared to my first dram, more fruity and a nicer finish. Smooth!"
3.0,"Not blown away but still solid. Has a special aroma, I would say dried figs. A nice woody and spicy finish with dried fruits, doesn't last to long unfortunately."
4.0,"Delightful for an NAS at this price. Clean and lightly briney Speyside character, with sweet ginger candy and candied orange peel... and a golden sherry influence that rounds things out nicely. Light, but not sharp or thin. Polite, but with a bit of a gut from the sherry. It delivers."

4.25,"I HAVE HAD A WONDERFUL WHISKY NIGHT, i am in Buenos Aires, Argentina in Whisky live, the most important (and only ever) whisky tasting event in south america. I have tasted 16 whiskies tonight, some of them really amazing.

Glenrothes is a great distillery. Definitively my favorite speysider after Glenfiddich, and this dram was not a dissapointment. 

Bottled at 40%abv.

On the nose, LOTS OF SHERRY. Blackberry Marmalade, and wedding cake. Great aroma.

On the palate, very smooth, a pleasant oakyness, very creamy with a bitter ending. Finish was quite lovely.

Overall i give this dram a solid 88 over 100. Cheers!"
3.25,"Better than average. Low ABV and smooth.

3.0,"I recently purchased a bottle of this for those days I feel like drinking something that’s not overly complex and easy to drink in larger amounts.  I’ve had a few different samples from Glenrothes, but never an entire bottle.  This was found locally for $40 and remembering that this stuff is generally easy drinking, I opted for the purchase.

This particular bottle is bottled at 40%, has color added and is chill-filtered.  It’s a deep gold with a slight red hue, while appearing very oily and making lots of legs and droplets around the rim.

The nose is typical Speyside sherry with red berries constantly present.  It’s slightly muted on the nose and palate, with some sawdust notes creeping in if you let it sit awhile.  There’s no real barrel notes to be found.

The palate is again, primarily, berries and a smooth malty characteristic.  It’s overly watery with some bitter oak filtering in later on the back end.  The oiliness disappears as well and it turns a little dry.

The finish is short and all the flavor washes away a bit too easily for my liking, but there’s a slight warmth that stays behind.

Overall, there are bits that seem artificial, but the entire profile is true to most sherry cask whisky styles.  If anything, it needs a boost in ABV and maybe some more cask presence, but then that would probably increase the cost and open this up to more scrutiny.  As it is, just 2.75-3 stars is all I feel like it warrants.  It makes for an easy drinker for those days you just want to sit around and sip on something sweet while catching an afternoon buzz.  There’s nothing wrong with that.  Cheers, my friends."
