4.25,One of my go-to sippn drinks. Just the right amount of smoke. Nice earthy and fruity finish. Smooth. Not overly alcohol so less bite.

3.0,Very average
3.75,"Glen Moray is a very traditional distillery in scotland but i have only heard of it when accidentally found a 12yo bottle in Colombia, and since it was a single malt i had to buy it. In whisky live i had the opportunity to taste the 15yo of this very fruity whisky.

On the nose it is a very Fruity whisky just as the 12yo, with fresh pears and apples, but this expression also has chocolate and cinnamon. 

On the palate Dark chocolate, very Creamy
And Cereal notes. Finish is short and simple. It is very similar to the 12yo.

Overall i give this dram 79 over 100, and it is a normal, not bad dram."

4.0,"Sweet, little nose"
3.5,"Nose: Orange liqueur, malt, mild banana, vanilla, apple cider, moist earth. As it rests in the glass the aromas of rich oak casks start to emerge. With water some floral and sherry notes come to the front. The nose loses a little definition but the melded aromas are very pleasant. [After watering, the dry glass has an aroma of milk chocolate!].

Palate: A sweet arrival with mild baking spices and lemon zest. Hard caramel toffee, a faint hint of licorice (or maybe anise), stewed apples and more spicy notes are noticed as it develops. There is a faintly metallic barley note but it's not objectionable. The texture is full but just short of either creamy or oily. Adding water develops more caramel toffee characteristics but does not mute the spicy notes too much.

Finish: Medium. Spices and cereal that gradually fade. You definitely taste barley grist at one point and it lingers into the aftertaste. Adding water breaks the finish - it becomes much shorter and less interesting.

An enjoyable single malt if not an outstanding one. At AUS$72 it's very fairly priced for a 15 year old expression, but keep in mind it's not one of the greats.

The Distiller official score is pretty much on target but I didn't get some of the tasting notes - in particular I didn't notice any smoke on the nose and neither did I think the palate was over-oaked (however bear in mind I tasted this right after the Method & Madness Single Grain which indeed has a madness degree of wood influence).

My instincts make me want to give this 3 stars based on quality but that's only ""Above Average"" in my system. Taking the very reasonable price into consideration I'm pushing it to 3.5. If you're on a tight budget and want to try a proper 15 year old scotch that is easy to drink, has a pleasant profile and a balanced character you could do far worse than this Glen Moray.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"
