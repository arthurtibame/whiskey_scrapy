5.0,"In this gorgeous rye there’s a dark copper color with thin semi viscous legs slowly dripping down the glass.

The complex nose of this particular barrel has notes of sweet cinnamon sugar toast, cherry, grilled corn, cherry candy, BBQ char, damp forest floor, barn straw, mixed salted nuts, aspen dust, with honey and flowers. With a splash of water it becomes more floral and grassy with salted pecan and orange notes.

The palate has a creamy mouthfeel and starts with some expected high proof heat. Notes include oatmeal raisin cookie, burnt caramel, milk chocolate, and baked green vegetables. With a splash of water, more orange citrus notes come forth.

The finish is long and initially spicy that tapers into mintiness.

This particular review is ironically for barrel 599, of Distillery 291’s barrel proof flagship rye recipe. The nose is amazing, the flavor is full, by far my favorite rye to date! Definitely recommended. Cheers!"
