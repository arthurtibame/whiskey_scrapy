I had this side by side with a 25 year 1993 Glendronach that was matured in a nonspecific sherry butt.  At the end, it was hard to say which one was better.  The 1993 definitely evolved from a rather unpalatable whisky to a delicious dark sherry masterpiece with some water and time.  This 1994 did not change much with water or time.  It remained an indulgent bounty.

I tried PX sherry in Spain.  It’s like ice wine in Canada, in that if you look like a tourist and you order it, the bartender goes, “Are you sure?  It’s really sweet.”  And they are right to give you warnings, because both are nearly undrinkable.  Yet, whiskies that spend a long time in PX sherry casks are always spectacular.  The malt somehow perfectly complements the sweetness.  Single malts exclusively aged in PX sherry casks are rare, but they are delicious.  Beware of those that are finished in PX, however, as these tend to be poor quality and the PX is used to hide flaws.

This whisky is a candied treat.  Marmalade that would make Paddington rabid.  Concord grape jam.  Guava.  Blackberries.  Violets and roses.  I almost want to spread this over bread with peanut butter.  I am trying to remember a more enjoyable sherried whisky experience, and I can’t.
