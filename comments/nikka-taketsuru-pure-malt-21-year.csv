4.0,"i do not think this is peated or a blend.. but too lazy to get up and check the bottle..

i prefer the yoichi 15 year, which i find to have a much more complex and robust flavor. this is a little too sweet for my taste"
5.0,"Excellent whiskey.  Aroma is sweet, honey-like, perhaps Apple, reminiscent of madiera with some oak.   Mouthfeel is heavy.   Taste is smooth and slightly sweet ending with the apple. There's a sharp fruit taste that some have described as anise.  Very good."

4.0,"This note is from distant memory, so take it with a grain of salt.  I enjoyed a pour of this whiskey at a work function last summer, and recall thinking it was quite pricey at $28 a pour (which is a great price now that a bottle costs $400+).  The world's gone a little insane for Japanese whiskies, perhaps in excess of what they deserve.  They are every bit the equal of Scotch whiskies, but they're now priced at a tremendous premium (probably have to pay twice the price or more for comparable quality).  I recall being impressed by the rich, honeyed malt character of this dram, along with its smooth and lingering finish.  The Japanese whiskies are some of the best at capturing the core malty flavor at the heart of a 100% barley distillate.  There's a bit of smoke here, but less than in a Johnnie Walker Black or a Talisker 10.  I would not recommending adding water, as it seemed well composed, and I don't see a dip below 40% ABV being to its benefit.  I'm somewhat amused to see that reviews of Japanese whiskies tend to impute flavors to the whiskey that are Asian in origin (e.g., ginger, five-spice).  I'm not sure I get those myself, but the power of suggestion is a wonderful thing.  I'll give this a 4 while giving minimal consideration to price, since I didn't end up covering the tab, but it's not a noticeable step up from lots of scotches in the $75-100 price range.  Nikka Whisky from the Barrel, which remains easily accessible whenever in the UK or EU, is better regardless of price (and, at $40 for 500ml, I'd opt for it every time).  Note:  Apologies for any confusion caused by my earlier mistake of posting this to the Taketsuru 12."

4.0,"The elder of the two Nikkas that I recently acquired has a sweetly perfumed nose with a hint of baked apple. The palate is black tea with a dash of honey. The finish is long, dry and peppery, culminating in a drop of simple syrup. It’s a notch above the 17 but not quite in Hibiki territory."

4.5,"NOSE: Gentle and delicate, but deep. There’s fresh moss, mint maybe, with a rich creamy vanilla bean underneath. With a side of creme brûlée.

PALATE: It’s a fresh fruit bomb. Peach. Pear. Lime. Surprised to find it so fresh after 21 years! Sweet but there’s some dry leaves or cigar in there too. Dries into a sweet finish where that old oak gives you some mint chocolate flavors.

OVERALL: Just a pleasure from nose to finish. Zero burn or sharp notes. It’s really a carefully perfected flavor journey. Would love to spend more time with this, maybe bump the score even further up."

4.5,"Getting back to this one, as it was what got me started on fine Japanese whisky.

Nose of plum and green wood smoke.
Rich, oily mouthfeel arrives even before the flavor.

Apple and cantaloupe melon flavor, with a crisp and dry finish.  Some pepper heat."

null,"Review #5 of 12 from DC Whiskyfest 2018. I was only able to do 12 because I came down with something that afternoon that really messed with my head and stomach. I should have just stayed in the hotel room but I didn’t pay $350 for VIP tickets to sample my pillow!
No scores for anything sampled as I don’t think it would be fair.

Nice oak, floral, oranges and cherry blossoms on the nose. 

Balanced oak, pepper and floral on the palate. 

Not blown away but it was good."
null,"""** Disclaimer: This review is what I would consider a “Quick Hit”- meaning I won’t have my usual in-depth notes that I usually like to take. The reason: this sample was poured at Whiskyfest DC on 4/17/18. All of these reviews will not be scored and I am actively looking to try them again at some point to do them more justice.

This was the only Japanese whisky I tried at the festival (somehow I missed the Hibiki table for the 17yo).  This one was really complex and smooth- I remember it being chocolatey and peaty.  There was sherried fruit as well.  It didn’t register right away but as I was walking to the next booth it all arrived on the finish.  I should’ve went back later for an extra bump, but I ran out of VIP time because I was chasing @Telex away from the HP booth girls.  At least, that’s my story..."
null,"I’m a bit underwhelmed by this one - I snagged a bottle not knowing what to expect; I’v read reviews with the words “habiki 21” peppered throughout - .. I gotta say that’s not accurate in my eyes; habiki 21 is extremely refined; it has depth, has a deliberate uniform profile with elements of cherry, chocolate, and other wood - Nikka has a few echoes of habiki, however it’s not as pure- to me this basically tastes like habiki mixed with Johnny walker black. 🤷🏼‍♂️"

3.5,"This is a whisky without flaws.  From first nose to the last sip’s finish, it just makes sense, and it makes no mistakes.  That is very rare, and something to be cherished, these days.  But it is not a perfect whisky, which is one that takes risks and makes mistakes, but the imperfections add to its perfection.

This dram introduces itself with crisp, clean fruits such as peaches and plums.  On the palate, the texture is very creamy and there is a rich caramel.  The finish is dark chocolates and a soft pleasant woody linger.  I’ve never smelled or touched sandalwood, but I’m guessing it is soft, and is what gives a well-aged Japanese whisky that meditative balance.

This is not a beginner whisky, not just from a pricing standpoint, but beginners will enjoy it.  There is a force of purpose behind this whisky and you can tell it is blended so that flavors synergize to increase the amplitude.  This is more complex and textured than most single malts, and there is a lot of stuff for you to sink your teeth into.  The closest comparison for me would be Compass Box This Is Not a Luxury Whisky.

I do not remember Hibiki 21 that well enough to say for sure which one is better.  I do remember that trying Hibiki 21 was not a moment when time stopped, as I was promised.  Time did not stop for the Taketsuru 21 either because it did does not challenge you with any unique notes, but it is priced somewhat appropriately for a flawless, but not perfect, luxury dram.  When I tried the Hibiki, it was on shelves for around $500.  Today, if you can find it on a shelf, it’ll be more like $800.  This Nikka Taketsuru 21 is much more common on shelves in my area, and it’s around $350-400.  Certainly from a price standpoint, this is more reasonable. 

Score: ** (unimaginably good) 
How much does a bottle cost: $350-500 
How much do I think a bottle is worth: $320"
