3.0,"Damp and dreary evening with Joaquin remnants swirling suits well with this warming dram. Nose is sweet with honey and vanilla tones.  Hints of freshly cut ginger root and smoke can be found if your patient.  Medium-bodied on the palate wrapped in a rich amber tone.  Oak is dominate with ginger root countered with the sweetness of honey sweetness and vanilla. A faint amount of smoke pops in.  Drying tannins in the front and lingers on the palate. Long finish with a small amount of burn on the tongue that gradually fades leaving a dry, oaky, black peppery, spicy finish. Water opens the nose bringing out more vanilla and orange?  Rounded and smooth with no burn on tongue.  The finish flattens out.  Prefer without water. [$46][85/100][Revisited: 9/12/14, 10/3/15; 2/25/17]"

3.0,"Nose: Hints of cream and wee smoke but overall, sweet and fruity.

Taste: Very peppery, white and black peppers dominate with hints of smoke. Some fruits and nuts behind the spices.

Finish: The aftertaste is long because of the spices. Some honey mixed in there as well but the spices take over heavily.

Balance: Mainly sweet and peppery. Honey and smoke balance decently in the mix."

3.0,That's going to tickle your nose hairs. It's smooth but with an antiseptic taste. Think it needs to age. It's a typical gift whiskey. It's a nice and smooth whiskey. After a few sips the antiseptic turns to mild peat and it grows on you.

3.0,"Love the smokey aroma with a slight hint of bacon to my snout. Someone said antiseptic, I say pleasant bloody numbing (if only you got this at a dentist). 
To my amateur palate I get a nice dose of honey with a tinge of vanilla , coupled with some oak. Love the buzz in the mouth, like alcoholic Space Dust.
Just re-sniffed and also get a lovely hint of double cream mixed with cigars. Odd combination but smells alright.
I am sure there are loads more snifs and tastes to get out of this, but I am here to taste it and writing this has taken too long already.
I like it."

Really pleasant, quite a few layers, I need a bottle of it.

3.0,"On the nose: First oak and playing somewhere in the background a very subtle peat. Like someone put an ever so small drop of Laphroaig in while you weren't looking. There is also vanilla, very sweet on the nose. Interestlingly, there is the smell of the Baltic, which means not much salt or brine,  but a very faint smell of the sea. The nose is VERY sweet, I imagine this could be off-putting for some people.

The first sip is very disappointing. Like you expected the Atlantic, bold, vibrant, fresh sea air, waves crashing; but instead you got subdued and calm. It seems watery. The palate does not live up to the nose and that is annoying. It feels like someone took a creamy luscious Talisker 10 yr and added too much water. 

On the next and later sips there is lovely wood, vanilla, peat and some leather. As you swallow a slight cardamom taste appears. Then comes a light smokey flavor. The finish is decently long and enjoyable, if not a bit drying.

Overall this is a good whisky to introduce someone to single malts.  I give it a solid 3.4. I purchased a 350 ml bottle and I'm glad I didn't put out for a full-sized bottle, but not disappointed I bought the smaller size. I'll enjoy this but probably won't buy another."

3.0,"Had a tasting pack of three Jura expressions a few nights ago.  Superstition is a very lightly peated, if peated at all, variant on the core Jura single malt.  According to most sources, 13% of it is heavily peated, which is not much from a flavor standpoint.  As a result, it is the sweetest and most Highland in style of the three Juras that I tried.  For some reason I've been pulling this note from a lot of scotches recently, but Superstition's nose struck me as almost pure apple, with some molasses or syrup ladled on top.  On the palate, exotic fruits and sticky toffee amp up the richness.  The peat manifests itself as some earthy, mossy notes in the background, but there's no smoke, like a damp driftwood that won't ignite.  That might be the rearguard of that small proportion of peated malt.  The texture is full and thick given the moderate ABV.  For what it's worth, this scotch doesn't betray the typical flaws of youth, like a short, bitter finish or an aldehyde scent, so I'm intrigued by the lack of age statement on it.  It doesn't feel significantly younger than the 10-year old Origin.  The fruity but rich finish almost seems lightly sherried to me, although I'm not sure to what extent this dram (or what proportion of this dram) is sherry-finished or sherry-aged.  The strange thing about this single malt is that I've looked at some reviews online and it seems like everyone gets a completely different experience from it, with some sites even describing it as heavily peated in flavor and others rattling off notes that I did not notice at all (while not mentioning that almost overpowering apple cider scent).  I wonder if Jura has changed the composition over the years or if they just have spotty quality control."

1.0,"""I love the islands. Who wouldn't want a cottage on Jura to spend winter nights? Sadly to my regret I am unable to be a fan for Superstition. Starting backwards it finishes far too quickly (ok, not as quickly as a Jack Daniels No7 which frankly is nanoseconds) but quick. Very sharp, pepper abounds, the hint of peat has disappeared altogether; PALATE: Cool, smooth and oily, becoming a little creamy, very nutty, barrel-wood, but where is the fruit? Perhaps I've been spoilt by my other bottles? Warms the mouth but not the chest; NOSE: slight hint of smoke, leather, oak, tending to sweet and then medicinal. OVERALL: it is good value for money and perhaps 1-star is harsh, but I think it needs something extra to be a contender. However it won't stop me from other Jura which I am eager to try next. Hud."""

Palate: sweet, buttery vanilla with a slightly salty edge, mixed with some toasted cereal notes and a small dose of peat
Finish: medium, salty-sweet and buttery, with the peat making a final appearance before quickly disappearing. I also get inexplicable notes of black olive that might be due to an alteration of the whisky rather than represent an actual feature.

This whisky has a satisfying, more-ish quality that in my opinion is its best feature (and that led me to give it 4 stars instead of 3); it's not amazingly complex, but it's so, so nice to drink, and at the end of the day isn't it what this is all about? A whisky for these rainy days when nothing goes your way and you just need a good pick-me-up."

2.5,"info: C'est un assemblage de whisky ayant jusqu'à 21 ans d'âge. La moitié est un whisky lourdement tourbé alors que le reste ne l'est pas. Il y a une mention d'ajout de colorant. Je supose qu'il doit être filtré à froid mais, je n'en vois pas mention. Aucune mention d'âge aussi. Probablement que la mention d'âge du scotch le plus jeune de cet assemblage n'aurait pas fait bon marketing. Je déteste quand on me donne si peu d'information comme si l'on tentait de nous mettre la poudre aux yeux. L'édition est limité et discontinué. 

Esthétique: Ok, on peut avoir une bonne première impression. Belle couleur ambré, bel emballage, belle bouteille. Thématique de l'ankh qui porte chance. Rien à redire 8/10

Nez: Caramel salé, légère fumé. Très caramélise. Je ne peux rien dire de mal jusqu'ici. l'odeur est agréable. 18/20

Bouche: Chaud. Caramel. Sel marin iodé. La tourbe n'est en fait qu'une mince fumé très plastique. Qu'est-ce qu'ils ont Jura à vouloir toujours tout forcer avec leur caramel et leur filtrage à froid? 28/40

Final: Plastique et amer sur un fond de sel et de fumé. 12/30

Overall: Non. Je n'ai pas de plaisir avec ce gout. J'aimerais l'aimé car c'est une belle bouteille et tout mais, le champ aromatique ne me rejoint simplement pas. Ce caramel plastique typique de Jura! Je crois que c'est la tourbe Jura qui ne me fait pas non plus (même si elle est très subtile). Cette distillerie devrait essayer autre chose plutôt que de retenter toujours la même chose. Je sens qu'il y a tout de même une complexité respectable dans ce whisky. 43% c'est faible. J'aurais aimé une présence aromatique plus affirmé. Malgré tout ce n'est pas le pire Jura que j'ai gouté. Mitigé sur celui là, c'est n'est pas totalement un produit horrible, ce n'est pas un excellent produit non plus mais c'est définitivement pas pour moi. 62% moins 5% pour l'ajout de colorant et moins 5% pour le filtrage à froid = 52% (et je me trouve généreux!)"

3.75,"Day 14. The ""peated"" one. It's not much but it could be a decent start to get into peated whisky.

The nose has slight salt and peat notes, caramel, vanilla, grapes and some oats. 

Taste is a lot sweeter than I thought it would be, but there is still a slight peat and salt note in it. Not bad actually. Some honey and vanilla add more sweetness, and all in all it reminds me a bit of christmas cookies. Not bad. 

Aftertaste is salty caramel and a hint of bitterness from the peat. Doesn't stay all that long though. 

All in all, for 30 bucks a very good whisky. Not as much peat as I had hoped, but it is still enough to be an introduction."

Men gillade den inte så skarpt."
2.75,"My third and last Jura for this round! This dram is comprised of two different malts. One peated and one none peated. While this is a no age statement the whisky is supposedly 13-21 years old.

Definitely a sweet nose with honey, some notable smoke and spices. 

The palate has a foundation of that promised peat, but only lightly as intended. It also has a hint of oak and then plenty of spices. I'd say the burn is mild for 43% ABV. 

Quite pleasant and oily finish with again a gentle amount of peat smoke and all spice. Noting off with some medicinal pine and some salt.

Out of the three from the travel retail exclusive pack that I got, this was the better one!

3.25,"Nose:  The nose is warming with oatmeal, sweet peat, honey, and a small bit of toasted coconut.  There's a note in there that reminds me of banana chips.  A big dose of sweet malt rounds it out.  Maybe a bit of toasted grain and woodsmoke that weren't there initially.

Palate:  Honey sweet initially, followed by an oily peatiness that lingers and turns more earthy.  Heather and toasted malt, a small bit of roasted apple.  Leather and seaweed.

Finish: Medium length oily. Warming, earthy peat.  Toasted barley with a slight hint of coconut.  Candied corn. Oaky sweetness.

Conclusion:  I've seen some good reviews and bad reviews.  Most of the bad reviews though, say something like ""disappointed with the level of peat"" or something.  It says ""Lightly Peated"" right on the bottle... They did what they set out to do, I think it's a wonderful example of a lightly peated scotch.  The smoke doesn't overwhelm any of the other components, but it's still there if you look for it.  This isn't the most complex whisky out there, but I find it rather enjoyable.  It's not the best, but it's a great casual sipper."

3.25,A very pretty dram that's toasty and sweet but not cloying with minimal perceptible smoke. Great for those who dislike peat or love caramel browned marshmallows. Highly recommend this NAS at the price point.
2.25,Very sharp and not long lastning but it Will do.

3.0,"Had a couple of bottles a while back. This review is based on 1/2yr old memory...

Nose: Medium peat, with a mash, boggy/sour quality. Peppery licorice tones as well. A bit of sweetness. The boggy note may sound a bit off, but strangely enough it works well. 

Palate:The palate is medium thick, and confirms the nose. Quite smooth texture. Maybe it’s the added caramel fooling me, but it feels quite dark and full in taste for burbon cask.

Finish: Smooth lingering light peat and licorice. 

Overall: Not too complex but very accessible and casual to drink while not being boring, though the boggy style of peat may ny appeal to everyone. I score it 3, i.e. a decently good whisky. I’ve read some bad reviews on this (e.g. Jim Murray), that I do not believe are fair at all."

4.0,"I was really disappointed when Jura removed Superstition from their standard range, it had been a staple of my cabinet for quite a few years.

This is a sweet and oily dram.  It has almost a honeyed taste that fades into a medium-long finish of pepper, spice and chocolate.

There’s a very light peatiness that gives a nice little warmth, but it’s certainly not one of the predominant flavours.  Very easy to drink.  A lovely, light dram."
3.75,"This expression tastes very similar to the 10 yo, but with more peat smoke and the brine is much more intense on both the nose and tongue.  This is no longer mentioned on the current Jura website.  I don't know if that means it is being discontinued or not."

4.5,"I love when whiskies surprise me. This one is one pleasant surprise. Very gentle and elegant, maybe designed for starters.

On the nose is beautiful with a soft peat, very similar to Johnnie Walker Red label and old Ballantruan, but mixed with vanilla cream, honey and caramel.

On the palate, it is a very soft, medium bodied drink, that starts neutral, with no flavor at all to develop into a honeyed, woody, oaky  flavor. Finish is long and refreshing, with spices and a mild hotness which is very pleasant. Very recommended, i am looking forward for more of Jura and its variants"

3.25,You don't really get Peat n smoke on the nose or on your palate. Somehow i smell a hint of  dried fruit like sherry cask. You do get general bourbon notes in there.
3.5,Sweet with a hint of peat. Vanilla. Got a whiff of chlorine that put me off a bit though.
