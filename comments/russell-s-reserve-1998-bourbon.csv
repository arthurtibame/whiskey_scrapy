4.25,"Very nice nose, subtle but spicy. Pepper kick in the mouth but surprisingly smooth going down. Drink it neat and let it sit a minute to open up."

4.0,"This casually walks a very fine line between too much and just right. 

A rich (but a little hot) nose of dark maple syrup, a fistful of cinnamon, and dried cherries. 

The palate is fairly hot and benefits from a drop or two of water. Red apples, leather, nutmeg, and dry cedar. The finish comes in two parts. First, quite bitter and dry from its substantial age. Though this dies down and the spice and heat take over creating a sensation found in red chilis.

This is good exotic bourbon. If it had a little more restraint and focus it would be quite the showstopper."

4.0,"Definitely more spicy than sweet. I can appreciate it, but it's not a favorite. I like more oak and it doesn't really shine. 
      2nd Tasting: I'm getting the sweetness now. It's a dark sweetness with some woodiness and dried fruits. I think I kinda love it. Glad I'm able to taste from a friends bottle & still keep my sealed. Still can't believe my note is the lone wolf on here. Has nobody else really tasted it?

I'm saying goodbye to my bottle. Found a trade I couldn't pass up. I'm getting a George T. Stagg 2013!!!"
