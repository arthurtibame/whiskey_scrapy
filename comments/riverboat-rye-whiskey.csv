2.0,"Was looking for a quick/cheap rye to share at work, but also something that I've not had before. At $22 this won, but I was skeptical. Unsurprisingly this rye has a very light body (it basically evaporates once it hit the palate) and as a result the flavors are hard to gather. Definitely floral and definitely young."

3.0,"A great basic American whiskey, perfect mixer for whiskey based cocktails."
3.0,I was looking for a non-scotch whiskey to mix with soda. This fit the bill perfectly. It also is enjoyable with ice. Is it complex? No. But sometimes simplicity is good. And you can't beat the price.
3.75,"Although my bottle doesn’t look like the one figured, I do believe it is the same whiskey. 
Nose: Apple, spice. Mouth: nice sweetness, fairly smooth. Not as much spice as most ryes. Late palette has a crisp apple note."

null,Sweetest rye I’ve ever had. I don’t see it cutting through well in a mixed drink. 7/10
