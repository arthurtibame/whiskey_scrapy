4.5,"Starts off super hot, with notes of caramel corn and brown sugar, fades into a spicy, smooth leather flavor"
4.0,"Neat. Opened three months or so.  Whiskey Bear 4 year pick.  First impression on this one is that it was too young and green.  Let’s see what a few months of air time does.

Still very bright but just a little green.  Caramel dominates this one.  Vanilla frosting.  Hints of apple.  Baking spices.  Almost like an apple parfait.  

Caramel and vanilla frosting dominate again.  Apple shows up on the legs.  Not much else to say.  It’s tasty.

For 4 year MGP, this is really good.  I’d put it above Mic Drop 3.0 but still well under the 5 year SAOS floating around.  At least it is better than the first impression and the overwhelming youngness subsided."
