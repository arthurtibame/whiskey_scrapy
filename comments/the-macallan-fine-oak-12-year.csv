3.0,"Fine oak = Triple barrel (American Oak/American Sherry and European Oak). A step away from the traditional all sherry barrel Macallan due to high demands. Light and Crisp nose Fruity with the sweet sherry flavor in the finish, with a medium finish. Hard to find and gone up in price with the Macallan new NAS whiskies! If you find it for a decent price  get it!"

It's a classic single malt with liquorice.
Medium body, medium finish.

3.5,"Way inferior to the 15yo, another typical macallan profile, maybe a little boring, but gets the job done. 

Bottled at 40% 

On the nose is your typical Macallan: Dulce de leche, chocolate, herbal, twix, toffee, burnt oak and sherry.

On the palate it is a little bitter but smooth. 
Herbal, Toffee, Clove and Ashy notes.

Finish is medium with clove and some ashes. Overall this is a normal dram maybe the most standard macallan you can buy, it is cheap (around $50). My score: 78 over 100."

4.0,"Well, Christmas is over, and so is my advent calendar. Lucky for me, I still got 40 3cl samples I ordered for christmas. I enjoyed tasting new stuff each evening, turned into a ritual to relax. Also, I share them with my dad, so family bonding is also part of the equation. Might as well continue the daily dram. Tonight I picked one pretty much at random. Turned out to be the Macallan Fine Oak 12. Macallan is a name that is in my opinion overhyped and overpriced. Still damn good whisky though. On the nose I don't get much. Mostly the malty barley notes, some vanilla and citrus. The taste is suprisingly aggressive. Very, very bitter up front for about 2-3 seconds, and then it melts into sweet barley, some light vanilla cream, bit of citrus and honey. The sweet honeyed barley is what stays with you for quite a while. I normally don't like bitter stuff, but that melting into sweetness is actually really nice. It's like eating really dark chocolate filled with sweet mousse. Same feeling. Bitter, melting, sweet. Enjoyable whisky for a relaxing evening, but not the right one if you want to explore. Bit too expensive, but hey, that's Macallan in a nutshell."

3.0,"Nose: Peach, orange zest, cereal, almonds, a rather fine sherry note and a little bit of vanilla. In the background a hint of spicy oak.

Palate: The arrival is sweet and spicy, a combination of white grapes and barley sugar. More spicy notes appear in the development - mild ginger and sweet chili - together with sultanas and almonds. Malty cereal flavours build up supported by a clean oak presence. The body is light but creamy and very enjoyable.

Finish: Fairly short, but satisfying. Malty and honey sweet. The slightest hint of bitter cacao right at the end accompanying lingering oak flavours, but this is countered by sweet sherry notes and a fresh minty presence.

Crisp and clean, this is a nicely balanced and well-structured whisky. I was expecting something much more oak-heavy but instead the casks play a subtle supporting role.  There is a definite oak foundation but the multiple casks are mainly providing balance and complexity of spice for the dominant character, which is cereal and fruit.

Very pleasant, but just a little over-priced. If you can find it on special it's worth trying, but note that if it's the sherried profile of traditional Macallan that you like then this might not be to your taste.

""Above Average"" : 3 stars"

3.0,"Nose: Fruity, citric, orange, honey (maybe), vanilla, spiciness and something like freshly baked white cake. The ex-bourbon characteristics is evident. No alcohol perceptible.

Palate: Sweetness, honey, malt, fresh oak, some bitterness and spiciness. Very very simple. Low alcohol perception.

Overall impression: Soft and not a complex one, and some Macallan connoisseurs may strange this dram. The lack of complexity may be the lowest point in this whisky but its low ABV and drinkability may ease things to beginners"

3.75,The fine oak technique is from ages one of my favourite in whisky aging. The results of the triple cask maturation is in my opinion an outstanding mix of flavours that are always worth the taste. This can be used to craft wonderful (yet expensive) Rob Roys.
