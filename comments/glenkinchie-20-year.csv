5.0,"Paid $190 for this bottle. This is a bottle kill review. I will try to summarize what this bottle offered.

Nose: So green!  Green tapioca, underripe fruits, Granny Smith apple, grass.  Best utilization of grass notes of any whisky I can remember.
Palate: Sweet, as expected arrival, but then there’s an inexorable transition to smoky, spicy dryness.  Burning grass.  Menthol.  Green tea.  
Finish: Woody, herbaceous.  A little mezcal smokiness.  Minty too.  Decent linger.
This can handle some water.  Water will smooth out the edges and transitions.  Make things taste a little more cooked.

Very sad to see this bottle empty.  I would love to have another at the same price.
Pros: So unexpectedly charismatic for Glenkinchie.  A vibrant dram for its age, with a dynamic story to tell.
Cons: Bottled in 2010, and limited to 4854 bottles.  Probably won’t be able to find these anymore.  They aren’t really a collectible, so it’s hard to get even on the secondary market.

Mark: 93/100 (range 92-95. N = 7)"

#3: Glenkinchie.  Single Malt Scotch.  55.1% ABV.  20 years old.  D1990/B2010
Paid $190
If I find another bottle at the same price, I am probably buying it.

Glenkinchie ,well-aged and at cask strength, is beautiful.  The 24 year old special release, at $400-500 a bottle, I’m not sure is worth it.  But if you can find this 20 year old for under $200, this is a recommended purchase.  The nose is quintessential ex-bourbon matured scotch with a grassy edge.  The palate is amazingly spirit-forward.  A green attack of mint, eucalyptus, herbs, and grass.  The fruitiness comes from green apples and cucumber.  The finish is oaky, dry, and slightly smoky.  This is mind-blowingly good, and makes me sad about the Glenkinchie core range, which is pretty uninspiring.
