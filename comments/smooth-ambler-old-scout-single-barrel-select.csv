4.25,The 105.4 proof is obvious on the nose. I get baking spices and butterscotch mid palate. A nice lingering finish.
4.0,"13 yo, 53.5%, batch 13443.
Burn up front, kind of medicinal. Finish gives up lots of creme brûlée, a fantastic finish."

2.0,"54.9% ABV, batch number 13464 distilled in Tennessee. 

I can't get past the vitamin note; I dislike this immensely.  I do recognize that it has more complexity and flavors under the vitamin that other people may enjoy, but I don't."

4.25,Unique flavor... very bright and fruity... definitely can taste the Dickel base... smooth with an interesting vanilla fruit finish...
4.75,"Happy Friday Whiskey lovers! Short week (at least in the USA) do always feel the longest as I always feel like I am cramming in 5 days of work into 4! Add to that my wife ordered a new coffee table that requires assembly and that equals a stiff earlier than usual dram! 
What we have here today is a lovely 13 yr old Single Barrel bottled by the good folks at Smooth Ambler (based in West Virginia) but sourced from the great Dickel Distillery in Tennessee. This is a departure from the previous releases which were all previously sourced from MGP in Indiana (they still plan to release some but it will be in the 9 yes range). The other big difference is the Mashbill. This is a low Rye mashbill (84% corn, 8% rye and 8% malted barley) versus the high rye MGP mashbill (60% corn, 36% rye and 4% malted barley). Like the previous releases it is bottled at cask strength. My specific bottle comes in at 53.7% abv and is from barrel # 13450. The other thing to note is that unlike Dickels own products this is non chill filtered. No Lincoln County method (Google for specifics) on this stuff! This stuff is highly allocated and has a limited release (first time I have seen it at SRP which is $65). On to the tasting!
On the pallette it's very buttery and mouth coating with a big butterscotch note that adds caramel covered almonds with toasted oak notes a fast follow. Mid palatte has some cinnamon rolls and all spice that leads to tobacco and more of that oak and toasted oak combo. Big hug on the end. Proper Bourbon this! It reminds me of one of the better Barrel Bourbon batches (which also sources from Dickel). However, this is a full $30 cheaper and I would say right in there with the best Barrel has put out. 
For $65, it's an exceptional value on par with the ECBP releases (albiet a very different experience). The $125-$200 I see it go for online would make it a pass. I would keep an eye out for it and check the back of the bottle to make sure it was distilled in TN. If you see it for $80 or less I would pull the trigger. Cheers all!"

4.5,"Neat. 53.5% TN 13 years.  Lots of sweet corn at first.  Vanilla.  Baking spice.  Oak.  Syrupy texture, brown sugar on the initial hit.  Vanilla and oak on the taste.  Lots of sweetness.  Very very enjoyable.  Super smooth, simplistic sweet treat."
