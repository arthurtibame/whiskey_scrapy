5.0,Think of it as a variation on Blue Label at half the price. The most balanced and complex blended scotch imive tasted in its price category. No spice or uncomfortable tannic aftertaste - very smooth. Perfect for drinking neat.

3.0,"It's Johnnie Walker. It's fine. Not great and not remotely worth the price, but a pleasurable, mild whisky. Think Johnnie Black with a bit more refinement and a bit of a tropical, fruity backbone. Smoke, mango, papaya, pretzels, pepper. More a conversation piece than a whisky begging to be drunk."

4.25,"I truly believe this is a good dram, but it just doesn't cost $105. For seventy dollars it would have been a good deal. 

Bottled at 40%abv, amber color.

On the nose is very good. 4 notes very noticeable: Cocoa, Wedding Cake with Raisins, Tobbacco leaf and perfumed smoke.

On the palate is a little straightforward. Very similar to the nose: tobacco, cocoa butter, oak and crackers. 

Finish is medium-long with bonfire notes and ashes. 

Overall i give this dram 88/100, nice and interesting, but you can get a lot more for the price."
