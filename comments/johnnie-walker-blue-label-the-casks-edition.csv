4.5,"Nose - (w/o water) Spicy honey, vanilla, apple/pear juice, waxy, floral, freshly cut maple/cherry wood?, fresh red berries (w/ water) Less sweet, more waxy, nice fruity honey apple, lightly oiled leather.

Taste - (w/o water) Super light smoke, white pepper/ginger spice, sweet floral/fruity honey, vanilla, dark apple/pear juice, light apple core bitter, white cranberry juice sweet/tart (w/ water) Lightens the white pepper tingle, less oily/waxy mouthfeel, otherwise all flavors are still present.

Finish - (w/o water) Light lingering ginger/white pepper heat, dark apple juice, sweet, light metallic oak (w/ water) Spice is more delayed, metallic finish is greatly reduced, similar dark apple/watered down honey sweet.

Score - 91/100

Final Thoughts - This one surprised me quite a bit. It's a very nicely balanced blended Scotch, which I guess is what Johnnie Walker is aiming to do. Super gentle wisp of smoke on the palate which leads me to believe they put a small amount of Caol Ila in there, but this tastes like a large part Clynelish due to the nice oily/waxy mouthfeel and whatever older grain whiskies they have. This is a very easy sipping offering and is frankly what I think the ""standard"" Blue Label should be for the price.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - Not another unless I found it for less than $200 USD"

5.0,"There are a few varieties of the blue label but the casket edition comes with its own glass and box, serial numbered.

Smooth and goes best, on the rocks."
