4.0,Great rye whiskey with a subtle taste of maple sweetness. Great over ice or in a cocktail.
3.25,Very smooth. Maple is subtle. Sweet notes on the front and a smooth finish. No bite on the back end.

4.5,"Very smooth for a Rye whiskey. Light bite, with a spiced finished."
5.0,Awesome. We are a group of 5 whiskey enthusiasts and we all thought it was easily one of the best barrel finishes that I have tried. Also made a serious Manhattan with it tonight as we tested this both straight up and in a cocktail. Winner all round for us.

4.25,"Rye flavor comes thru and the maple finish is ever so slight.  I didn't detect maple flavor, but it was a smooth finish.  Well done."
