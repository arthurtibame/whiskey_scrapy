  INFO: Single malt scotch whisky from Islay.  Port Askaig is not a distillery.  The contents are officially from an undisclosed distillery, but they are widely known to bottle Caol Ila, which is located only 1 mile away.  This 110-proof is NAS, and bottled cask-strength at 55% ABV.  It is exclusive to the U.S., the first Port Askaig to be distributed in the U.S., and is the American version of the 100-proof, which is actually higher ABV (57.1%) because it uses the British proofing system.
  
  NOSE: 87/100.  Lard.  This smells like what’s left in the pan after you fry up some fatty uncured ham.  Such a good smell, but a bit one-dimensional.  I have not had young Caol Ila in a long time, and forgot how savory it can smell.  Missing here is the lemon zest of the 12 year old to balance things out.  If you add water – and this can take quite a bit of water – you get more iodoform gauze coming out than citrus.
  
  PALATE: 83/100.  Oily, waxy, and medicinal at the beginning.  It’s a smooth, mouth-coating feel with no burn, which is surprising for a young cask-strength scotch.  There’s these distracting off-the-wall flavors that remind you “I was only an infant when they sold me!”  They pop in-and-out like quantum anomalies: green pond water in the summer, soap, uncooked plantain, and used Band-Aids.  Fortunately, they don’t stick around.  Paired with some lamb or Char Siu pork, this works well.  This is missing meat flavor, and sets the palate up for something meaty, smoky, and well-seasoned.
  
  FINISH: 85/100.  Decent finish.  A lot of smoke, which probably masks a lot of the imperfections of being a young whisky.  Some vanilla and lemons emerge at last.  If you add water, the vanilla and lemons appear sooner in the mid-palate.  Where are the spices?  Man, this stuff must be YOUNG.
  
  OVERALL: This is not bad at all.  Old Caol Ila (>20 years) is awesome; among the independent bottlings I've tried at least, it’s better than Port Ellen.  This is a reminder that a young, moderately peated, cask strength, non-chill-filtered, non-colored Caol Ila also deserves some respect.  My polite gripe to Port Askaig is this: put the fucking age on the bottle, man!  It’s 3 years?  So what.  They’ve done everything to appeal to the enthusiast except to just be confident and say, “Age ‘aint nothing but a number.”  Put.  The.  Damned.  Age.  On.  The.  Bottle.
  
  MARK: 85/100.
  VALUE FOR MONEY: Tough call at $60.  Definitely wouldn’t go higher.  Side-by-side at $60 with a Caol Ila 12 year old, I’m picking the 12 year old."
4.0,"Mezcal like nose and finish, with a nice rounded vanilla note."
4.0,"This is straight up a cask strength Caol Ila that reminds me of a mix of 8 to 12.  Very nice nose with salty peat, apple, cinnamon, and dark fudge.  Palate is dang good as well with a ton of smoke, salty goodness, with some peanuts on the side.   A very nice dram with a long finish.  Bring on more of the cask strength goodness, anytime.  It might be the only thing that saves us from the NAS invasion."

4.0,"Pours a pale gold with a strong, smoky nose, with a touch of citrus.  Smoke is less prevalent in the flavor, but still a significant contribution.  I really like the elevated proof of this one...not the most complex whisky, but with added potency in the bottling."
4.0,"Port and spicy smell. 

Oily texture, Smokey and pepper sweet flavor. Very flavorful but a little too spicy."

4.0,"The smoke and peat really come through, but there’s enough sweetness to balance things out nicely."
5.0,The only way to taste more campfire than this is to be burned at a pyre.
4.0,I get a surprising sweetness (for the strength) and prominent bread/grain notes. It is easy to drink — this one can sneak up on you.
4.5,The peat I crave!!!
4.0,Lovely flavor and not nearly as alcohol forward as the proof would suggest.
3.0,Flaviar Peat Vol 2
4.25,Heavy mouth feel. Moderate peat smoke throughout. Smooth with a mildly sweet finish.

3.75,"Nose - sweet smoke from a bbq, light iodine on the back
Palate - light peat then a bit more iodine, salt and crisp apples
Finish - clean and herbal,
mint comes in after the smoke subsides"

4.5,"Smoke right away. You get a brine and salt note. Does not taste high proof, it’s been mellowed by the wood in a beautiful way. Once the smoke gives way, mint and a tiny bit of citrus slap you in the face. 

Whisky is thin and light in color. Not too oily. 

I love this whisky. Reminds me of Lagavulin a bit."
3.0,I like the peat but finish is a bit harsh
3.0,"Smoother and less iodine than Laphroig 10 year, goes great with a few drips of water to lessen the bite"

4.75,"Caught in a forest fire, smoke filling my lungs, I cast my gaze yonder, there is a squirrel that leads me to an ice cold brook. I dunk my head in, slurping up moss and apple and licorice. I stand up, and in my hands I hold an empty bottle of Port Askaig 110 proof."
2.75,Peaty with a strong alcohol taste.  Nothing amazing.
4.0,"You definitely get the smoke on the nose and palate.  Oily texture, and very light color.  Fairly long finish.  You can tell it’s a little higher proof, but still very drinkable. A little sweetness that is nice, I notice it more on the finish."

2.5,"Smokey, soft but not for me."
3.25,"Strong cheese, nice earthy smoke, but a bit overwhelming. Every few sips I'll get an opening of some fruits, but hard to identify and not consistent enough to be rewarding"
4.0,"Nose: bright, peat, oak, floral

Palate: peat, oak wood, sweetness, red licorice, peach, creme brûlée

Finish: long, warming, full"

4.25,"Very interesting nose with peat and smoke of course, with grassy at first sniff, but afterwards also citrus, lemon zest and surprising some red fruit character. 

On palate it is sweet, with citrus, caramel, honey above the peat and smoke.

Finish is pleasant honey sweetness that stays great for a long while"
4.5,Just keeps getting better...tremendously so.

4.5,"When I first tried this I felt it was good. Smoke, peat, good balance and finish. Each time I reach for it now it tastes better than I remember.  After a month I find myself reaching for it first, worried I won't find another bottle local. If you like ardbeg you'll like this."

4.0,nice balance. not super peat
4.0,Light and clear in color. Aroma of butter and caramel is very inviting.  Initial taste is peppery and has a nice bite.  Finish is medium and has a lingering caramel taste.  Medium smoke overall.  Hints of salt are available if you should seek out the flavor in the sip.  Overall good.

4.5,"Smells peaty but with a sweetness that blends wonderfully. The flavors are magnificent. Peat, with a healthy tail that let's the peat and sweetness blend together. I feel I can't get the flavors fully because I've been eating black pepper. But it tastes like a slightly unbalanced talisker 10."
3.75,"I can smell the peat, peppery strong alcohol.
Ashy licorice, cayenne
A bit of cinnamon, clove and hint of Apple or pear at the finish...reminds me a bit of Poire Williams"
4.0,"Nose: Dry, ashy peat.  Honey, toasted cereal grains.  Vegetal and slightly briney.  Mint, lemon oil.  Black pepper.

Palate: Smokey.  Peppery.  Ash.  Vanilla, cream.  The proof is absolutely evident - prickly without being off-putting.  Oily, which means it hangs out on your palate for days.  Finish begins with a burst of peppery ethanol and peat.  Slowly the lemon oil and mint come to the fore.  Then bananas, honey, dill, and brine."
