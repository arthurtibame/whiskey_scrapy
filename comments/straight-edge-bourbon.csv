null,"I have been looking for this for a while - not to be had closer to home on the East Coast, but got a bottle in Petaluma CA, which is about an hour from the producer's winery. Store I found it in was recommended to me by a local distiller (Sweetwater/Stillwater) as a knowledgable place, and when I picked my bottle up the store's proprietor claimed there's no more of this stuff for now (as of May 2016).  He said he snapped up the last that was presently available for distribution... Paid $50 FYI. Figured I would share story in case someone sees it and wonders whether to buy on the spot. 

I will have to update with actual tasting notes once I get it through my checked bag. Under the circumstances I am going to be mad as hell if the airline loses it."

4.0,"Out of the gates, Straight Edge is fighting and uphill battle. It's sister bourbon, Slaughter House, in my opinion, is one of the most interesting and satisfying bourbons I've ever encountered. That said, one hopes this particular outing lives up to that same hype.

Spoilers! It doesn't.

There's nothing wrong with it though. It's a strong bourbon with a woody nose, brown sugar, dried fruits and a subtle cherry profile. It's rich, deep and satisfying and does give you what you'd want out of a uniquely bottled bourbon. It's biggest issue isn't that it's a bad bourbon. Quite the contrary actually. It's really good. I genuinely like it and would recommend it to my whiskey friends.

It's biggest issue is that for the same price (or less), you could be drinking Slaughter House instead. This stuff is too good to use in cocktails, but not as good as Slaughter House. That's a tough place to exist unless one prefers traditional bourbons.

3.0,"I bought this one at Costco on a ""Buy one, Get one free"" promotion at $44.95/750ml.  After reading the bio on it, I expected something special.  When I opened it up it had a great nose.  I poured a couple of knuckles of it over an ice ball and let it sit for a minute.  On my price point vs. complexity scale it came in high due to its reduced price ($22.475/750ml).  It had a good taste and likability.  However, when compared to other $45/750ml bourbons it comes in as average.  Not bad, just nothing there to grab you concerning taste.  My recommendation is wait for it to go on sale then get a bottle and it will suit you fine."

4.0,"Nose... Think dessert. Almost like flan or creme brulee. So so sweet, like the inside of a marshmallow just broken open...

Appearance... A nice and clean light mahogany...

Taste... Rich dark fruits from the Cabernet leads to a nutty, full balanced flavor, with wheat notes followed by nutmeg and chocolate finishing it off.  

Overall... Graham crackers and nutty is my first taste. Followed by banana and pepper, backed up by the rich Cabernet notes on the back and sides of my taste buds. Finishing it off is a gentle Kentucky Hug that lets you know your drinking good Bourbon, one that's best sipped neatly with dessert... FOR THE PRICE THOUGH I'D GO WITH THE slaughterhouse INSTEAD."

3.25,"Solid pour. Very soft and approachable with just enough going on to keep you coming back for more. Pallette features vanilla and toffee initially, a bit of spice and oak mid palatte with dark red fruits (think Cabernet grapes) and more oak in meduim finish. More intense then expected for the low proof. This is a nice effort! Far better than the ultra sweet Slaughter House. While this one is on the sweeter side, it's not overbearing at all. Bottle price in my Market is $55 which to be honest is too high for this one. If you can find it for $40 or less, it's worth the purchase. For me, I'll stick to the $7 pour which is a fair value!"

I was pleasantly surprised by this one. The pallet has a slight oak flavor and the finishing barrel was a nice touch to a medium sweet profile. At first the the finish had kind of a waxy flavor in a good way, but once you know it’s finishing oak once held Cabernet wine it makes sense!"

4.25,"Nose: Caramelized brown sugar and vanilla, honey, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove.  Dark fruits.  Sweet red apples with orange.  Slight cream cheese cake frosting thing going on.  Barley in the back - slightly toasty cereal grain character.  Toasted sesame seeds.

Palate: Smooth, undoubtedly 80 proof.  Grain is much more up front - the barley is doing a dance.  Honey, oak, tannin.  Stone fruits.  Luxardo cherries.  Roasted peanuts/almonds.  The slightest cave mustiness.  Distant vegetal note.

Other notes: This was the first bottle I bought without knowing anything other than what the label says.  The nose offers up plenty to explore, and though the palate is relatively muted, the total experience is well worth the price of admission.  My only real criticisms here are that the palate does not deliver what the nose suggests, and there's a lot of bass and midrange without much treble.

As always, my rating is an attempt at being as objective as possible without my subjective biases swaying things too much in one way or another."

4.25,"I put this one on my ""buy"" list well over a year ago, but I never saw it in a store and I didn't get around to an online order.  In the meantime, I found the other Savage & Cooke offering, Slaughter House, on a shelf at one of my preferred liquor establishments, so I bought it.  In short, I thought it was good but not great, so I bumped the Straight Edge from the buy list.  It turns out that was a mistake.

I recently had an excellent visit to The Copper Still in Manhattan, and they had Straight Edge. Still curious, I ordered a pour.  

My favorite bourbons are usually smooth, a bit sweet, with some vanilla/caramel and limited spice.  Straight Edge squarely hits the mark.  Unlike the Slaughter House, the wine barrel finish is almost imperceptible on the Straight Edge, and certainly doesn't cover up any of the lovely bourbon flavors.

It's not complex, but that's part of the appeal for me.  I suspect that most fans of wheated bourbon will like this, and I also agree with other commenters that it's a great option for people who are usually put off by the intensity of straight spirits."

4.0,"750ml neat in a Glencairn at home.  Nose is sweet, with toffee and caramel, brown sugar and stewed apples.  Rich.  Taste is somehow both deeper and brighter, with the toffee descending to tobacco and leather, while the apple is joined by honey and orange.  Long finish maintains the richness and adds some spice notes.  Very interesting, unlike any bourbon I have had.  The Mercury Head barrels have really done some cool things to the whiskey.  My buddy Matt the Lion was right, I quite like this.  8/7/19"

Surprisingly smooth, sweet corn and vanilla throughout, this almost evokes feelings of nostalgia in me and I wonder how such a  relative newcomer could have nailed my idea of ""bourbon"" so well!
I would like to rate it higher but in Canada it is hard to get and costs a pretty penny, at times near the $100 CAD price point."

3.75,"The nose on this is very subtle.. you get a little hint of those smells you expect in a bourbon; vanilla, caramel, and some spice from the 17% rye mash. However they are very muted, and just when you think there is not much there, a red wine scent makes itself known.

Palate starts off sweet, with brown sugar and a very pleasant mouthfeel. Oily and smooth, yet light. Mid palate continues into familiar territory, more vanilla and caramel, some oak, dark fruits, and something that reminds me of dark chocolate.

Finish then does a 180 from palate and it’s wine all day long. You expect it but once your in it it’s like your having another drink.

Overall I think this is a bit overpriced, but I’m also in Canada so getting something like this from a smaller maker from California is bound to cost more.

I had already finished my glencairn before I remembered I was doing a tasting so yes it’s quite good."

3.75,"This is the red wine finished division of my barrel finished bourbon bracket. This was a blind taste test between Slaughterhouse Straight Edge and Hooker’s House 7/21. Golf claps will be accepted but are not required.

Both are good, and value/dollar, this one definitely wins (less than one third the price of a good Hooker’s). But if you have more dollars than sense, the Hooker’s House is where you want to go. Nose for this guy won, but I greatly prefer the body of my Hooker’s. And the finish on my Hooker’s was truly spectacular. In the category of overall enjoyment, I enjoy Hooker’s more. This ends the double entendre section of the review.

Next blind taste test will be Hooker’s House v Bardstown.

The tasting of Straight Edge:

The bottle doesn’t tell you what type of finish this has, and it’s borderline deceptive on the fact that it’s finished at all. You want to assume the best about the distilleries who produce the products you like, but when the front of this bottle has “Straight Edge Bourbon Whiskey” boldly on the front and “finished and bottled by Splinter Group” on the back in tiny letters, it makes you wonder if there was any intent. No, it’s not “straight bourbon whiskey,” and it is finished in Cabernet casks, though you’d have to look it up to know that. If there was intent, I’d discourage against it in the future. It’s a solid product, and a barrel finish done well is something to be proud of, not something to hide on the back of the label. If there was no intent, and y’all just go for the minimalist look, cool. You do you.

Nose is intriguing. Much like Boondocks did for port, this nose seems to have been completely dominated by the red wine influence. I like Cabernet so I don’t mind, but it’s strange to sniff this and know you’re in for a bourbon.

Body definitely tastes like red wine, but a new flavor creeps in. I raided my wife’s spice cabinet to make sure I was right about this: it’s almond extract. It’s too intense to be a natural almond flavor, and IMHO it’s too intense to be enjoyable. There’s also caramel, yeast, and vanilla, but that almond flavor takes the reigns from about halfway through the body to the end of the finish.

That finish makes me want less. There’s cinnamon and sugar, but the almond extract is the main player for sure. I’m finding that the longer I try to hold on the Cabernet flavors onto the body, the shorter I can make the almond on the finish. When done this way, the overall impression of the finish is raw dough for a cinnamon roll. It’s a very gentle drink, with next to no heat throughout.

I guarantee you there are people out there who will love this. I can’t say it’s poorly made, but it’s not where I want to be when drinking a bourbon. It’s unique enough that I’d recommend anyone who is into barrel finishes to give it a shot. I’d also say anyone really into Cabernet could use this as a gateway bourbon if needed. If you’re super into almonds for some reason, this has the potential to be your favorite whiskey. I won’t shy away from making this a “man down” in the near future, and I won’t avoid Slaughterhouse‘s other products because I really can taste the talent here. Still, when it comes to Straight Edge, I won’t buy again."
