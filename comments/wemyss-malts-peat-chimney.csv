4.25,"My final review on Wemyss malts, is this peat chimney a not so peaty whisky that lacks some balance. It is a blended malt from 16 whiskies and one of them is an islay malt 12yo. 

Bottled at 40%abv

On the nose, lemon, dim peatiness, very citric and medicinal. Prunes and.... gasoline.

On the palate, it is very nice. Chocolate, dry, ashy. Bonfire and a chimney would be a nice description for it.

Aftertaste is where everything fails, without been bad or off-putting. It is like an ashtray and it is way too burning and powerful not in the most pleasant of ways. 

Overall this is a good whisky, but you can get more refined peaty expressions for the price and far more enjoyable. 85 over 100."
