4.5,"Nose: Sherry, malt, butterscotch. 
Palate: oily and thick. Juicy Raisins and Sherry. Spicy oak and sea spray.
Finish: spice and Sherry. Medium.

This is my second bottle and is more Sherry forward than I remember..... but it is no doubt my number one favorite 12 year single malt! Non chill filtered and natural color. Not gonna find anything better for $50. It very complex and truly special."
2.75,Nose: sultana raisins. Taste: sherry.
