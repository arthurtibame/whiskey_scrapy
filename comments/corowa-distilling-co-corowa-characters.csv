2.5,"Living 40 minutes out of Corowa, I was geographically predisposed to like this. But it didn’t get there. Kind of has that ‘wet plank of wood’ vibe with some floral top notes. Okay, but nothing special."
3.0,"Australian Single Malt Whisky Tasting (Part 1), The Oak Barrel, Sydney 16 January 2020, Whisky #1

Nose: Cereal aromas well to the front with a little fruity note in support (red berries and grapes, but it's a dry fruity note rather than strongly fragrant). There is a light leatherwood honey quality and the faintest suggestion of smoke (but it might be something else I'm mistaking for smoke). The cask aroma is fresh and clean.

Palate: The arrival is mainly centered on cereal, full and rounded baking spice notes and a little sultana in the background. It's dry rather than sweet, but certainly not too dry. As it develops, more spice emerges together with lots of crisp barley grist (which is the central flavour component), some light preserved fruits and even a little dark fruit. It becomes slightly sweeter as it progresses and the texture is good.

Finish: Medium/short. Malty and lightly fruity.

This is a product of a young distillery located in the township of Corowa in New South Wales, right on the Murray River which is the border between NSW and Victoria. They are using locally produced barley and Australian casks for this expression.

The whisky is aged for two years in ex-red wine casks (first fill, I think) and you definitely get the sensation of fresh young oak and a subtle red fruit presence throughout the profile (but it's not what I call a strongly fruity whisky).

The nose reminds me of both G.Rozelieurs Blue and Hellyers Road Pinot Cask. All three are fresh, cereal-led and feature the unmistakable aroma of young red-wine casks. It's a slightly winey aroma with a woody background that is closer to plywood than old, seasoned oak. That may not sound complimentary but on the contrary, it's a pleasant and clean aroma - just not one that suggests age.

Adding water is not necessary as this whisky is easily quaffable at 46% with the alcohol content barely registering on the senses. It is also of debatable value as while it does unearth a little honeyed note on the palate the plywood aromas are over-emphasized and turn a little like wet cardboard.

I enjoyed this - it's young, fairly simple and direct (you could be harsh and say juvenile) but it has a fresh and vibrant honesty that is very welcome. It is also competitively priced for an Australian whisky and piqued my interest in trying more of their expressions.

""Above Average"" : 3 stars"
