Palate - rich palate of butterscotch, caramel, nougat
Finish - not the best part of the dram, slight astringency with some lingering fresh envelope notes."

3.75,"Sweet, candy, with sherry and raisins. Glazed donut is a nice description. Soft, easy drinking. With a slightly strange finish. But enjoyable. Would order."

3.0,"not enough sherry, slightly disappointed, definitely a blend and rice based"
3.25,"Vanilla and bananas on the nose.  Sweet throughout and a moderate burn unfortunately.  Definitely picking up the sherry, but not as smooth as I thought it would be."
1.0,"Nose- lightly astringent
Body- light citrus, light vanilla but with a wet paper flavor that goes along with rice whiskies
Finish- makes my mouth feel dry with the taste of licked envelopes
Rice whiskies are not for me."
4.25,"Delicious spice and vanilla, mild sherry notes"
