4.0,The rye has a nice upfront bite to let you know your drinking a rye and a smooth vanilla finish to remind you it was $70. Would definitely drink again.

4.0,"My ABV was 50% 100 proof.  The nose on this is so inviting.  Sweet acetone, not off putting at all.  A nice body, not thin.  Picking up some vanilla, I think from the bourbon barrel finishing."
4.0,"Sweet rye, stone fruits and baking spices on the nose, sweet and mildly spiced round palate, the finish is long with great balance between the sweet and spice."

4.75,Probably the best rye whisky I’ve ever tasted. Super flavorful with a burst of rye spice and anise. Of course there’s the caramel and vanilla  with a bit of pink peppercorn. Overall its like chewing on a couple caraway seeds. Just a phenomenal whisky.

0.25,"Received as part of a blind tasting. My notes:


Colour 1.3 - russet. What the heck is going on here?  Nose has roots, earthiness, grass, hay and almost eucalyptus. Complex nose but not in a good way.  Palate is worse, watery and it feels like when you accidentally swallow Listerine.  A bitter, sour palate and finish. Good news is the finish is short.  Cannot recommend. Cannot even identify what type of whiskey it is.  Let’s go with an F."

4.5,Happy New Year everyone. I had a chance this wonderful Rye whiskey yesterday and it is wonderful. The flavor is spicey and big. When I first sipped this neat it filled my mouth with spices like nutmeg or allspice and some sweetness with ice it mellows and I tasted some woodiness and caramel. This is a 100 proof spirit and even at that strength it is not super hot but I knew I was drinking a strong spirit. The only real criticisms I have are that it is expensive and it is hard to find consistently in my area. I wish I could taste all of the flavors that Ctrexman and Chumppunk could taste but this is still an outstanding Rye and I am glad I tasted it.

3.25,"Spicy, with heat."
4.5,"Super complex and flavorful. A whole heap of the fennel, anise, spicy and slightly maple/eucalyptus notes you expect from a rye whisky. One of the best I’ve ever had if not THE best."

4.0,"Nose: Sweet.  Bright green apple.  Baking spices and vanilla.  Oak.  Stonefruits.  Sweet lemon.

Palate: There's that green apple again.  Meyer lemon.  Clove, cinnamon.  Honey.  Oak and tannin."

4.0,Sweet peppery piggy perfection. One of the most accessible and consistent Ryes in the market. This out of the ordinary pour is worth the price tag.
