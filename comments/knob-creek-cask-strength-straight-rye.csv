5.0,"@Richard-ModernDrinking and I attended a Beam Suntory whiskey event tonight in central NJ, and  this was offered in the master class as a pre-release item.  For me, this and the Bookers 2x2 (which will be released tomorrow ) were the highlight of the evening.  And the fried chicken.  Screw the whiskey, the fried chicken was the highlight.  Anyway...I digress.  Can’t recall the tasting notes...but it was good enough for me to think “I need to look this up”.  Update:  just had another pour courtesy of a local shop...ended up buying a bottle.  Half way through 2018, and I may have found my Rye of the Year.  That too, at only $65."

3.0,"Thin nose initially. Opens up a little, some fresh linens, sandalwood, must, and... tomatoes? Maybe some Juicy Fruit gum. Palate is interesting, some young corn notes. Some nutmeg, oak, and slight bitterness. Mint and spice linger in a surprisingly long finish that gets dry after a while."

5.0,"Just picked up a bottle today and had a couple of drams from it. Wonderful nose of baking spices, caramelized sugars, some wood and long legs on the glass. On the palate, incredibly rich, sugary and vanilla sweetness with balanced cinnamon spice. Long finish that keeps you wanting more. Considering the proof, very smooth and absolutely delicious. In my opinion, no water needed to savor and enjoy this wonderful whiskey."

3.0,"Still had time to kill prior to my haircut (see my Booker's review) so I decided to look thru the bottles at the bar and found another one I had been wanting to taste. This was a bottle I hunted for but just missed out on and was disappointed not to be able to try. When I finally found it, they wanted $25 a pour and I passed. Fortunately here they only wanted $9, so I decided to take the plunge. 
The biggest takeaway from this one is it's not special in any way. I was shocked when I read so many reviews saying it was not a big upgrade on the regular Knob Rye, but that is a true statement. The additional proof points and age add very little. You get classic vanilla and brown sugar notes upfront. Then are hit with a big spice swell. The finish is meduim and not overly satisfying. It's pretty smooth for the proof. Am I dissapionted for a $10 pour. Not at all. It's a fair value. Would I be disappointed with a bottle? Absolutely. Pikesville for example is far better. 2.5/5"

3.75,"The nose here is a really nice spicy rye. Starts smooth on the taste buds but then accelerates through some spicy-ness and finishes a bit bitter for my liking and it lingers. Not a huge fan of drinking rye’s straight, so I may be biased. This did however, make the best (and most expensive) Manhattan I’ve ever had. The vermouth and cherries perfectly balanced out the bitter finish and made for a flavorful and smooth Manhattan."

3.75,"I think the expert nailed this at an 85/100, and let me tell you why. 

I first drank this about 2 weeks ago and i couldn’t put my finger on where i wanted to rank this. Don’t get me wrong, i liked it, but in a world where whiskey is full of gimmicks and prices just keep rising, i feel the need to really share an accurate rating. So i drank more another night, still i was undecided. 

So 2 nights in a row, i put this bottle up against some of my favorites in back to back tastings: Thomas Handy, Pikesville, Peerless. Now handy and Peerless are a much higher price point but the key here is that they are all bbl proof ryes.  

The result, it can’t hang with the big guys, but if Handy is MLB baseball, this bottle is a starter in AAA, almost there. But this bottle is at the same price point as pikesville, and pikesville has a richness this bottle doesn’t.  That along with the turpentine smell from the glass.  So, i ended up at a solid 3.75 stars."

Taste - (w/o water) Sweet oaky brown sugar, caramels, hint of mint, honey roasted peanuts, cinnamon spice, leather & sweet tobacco (w/ water) Bit more dry on the palate, less sweet, honey roasted peanuts, almond/peanut skin bitter, dark toffee/caramel

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering dull heat, oaky sweet, light woody mint stems, dark caramel syrup, dark peanut brittle w/ peanut skin bitterness (w/ water) Less heat, more oaky, sweet nuts, caramel, more sweet mint

Score - 87/100

Final Thoughts - This one was quite nice. It was surprisingly well balanced and wasn't amazingly hot for the proof. Nice initially subtle Beam peanut funk that works very well here. If it wasn't for the light mint notes, I might have thought this was a high rye bourbon due to the nice dark caramel sweet and only subtle spice. This would be great both neat and I think is better without water and would also do well in a cocktail.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - If I could find another for about $50ish"

4.75,"Taste:  2oz neat in glen cairn, then 3 drops of water.  This is batch #2, 127 proof, barreled in 2009 (NAS, but estimated at 9-10 years)

Nose (4.5):  Very well balanced nose.  For a rye of this strength is surprisingly not that spicy.  Some initial ethanol that dissipates quickly leaving you with the Jim Beam roasted peanuts, caramel, and some green apple.  If I hadn't poured this myself I would have guessed it as a high rye bourbon along the lines of ECBP.  Very well put together, nice and fragrant.  It is not complex, but I don't think complexity is the goal.  Some may find fault with that.

Palate (4.75): This is serious whiskey.  It jumps right at you and gives you a big Kentucky hug like some of the most noteable Booker's does (Center Cut comes immediately to my mind).  The first sip makes you go, ""whoa,"" but in that good way that tells you your taste buds and whiskey senses are up to be challenged.  This is not child's play stuff.  It is buttery, thicker viscosity, and has wonderful backbone.  You get a sweetness with a spicy background.  Spiced apple cake comes to the front with some molasses.  Also think warm apple strudel with raisins, nuts, and caramel over the top.  This is seriously good.  It is better in my opinion neat as the water only brings out some sweetness and hint of dill.  Leave it alone and you get an unparalleled richness.

Finish (4.75):   One of the best parts of this offering is the finish.  Reminds me of the current Michter's Barrel Proof Rye.  Sweet brown sugar, nutmeg, chocolate,baking spices then ending in fresh rye bread and a puff of smoke.  Surprisingly does not burn at 127 proof!  It does warm you and beckons you to sip more.

Overall:  If I were to taste this blind I would immediately think older Booker's, GTS, or Thomas Handy.  All of those flavors are there in this one in spades, and the backbone that hugs you at the first sip is like an old welcoming friend.  You want to sit back and sip while in a rocking chair while chatting. That said, rye purists may think this one may be too sweet. One could mistake the richness for too much sweet brown sugar.   As you know, if you follow my reviews, I am partial to excellent ryes and have a soft spot for them.  This hits that spot for me!  I place this right up with this year's Michter's which up to this point is on my top 5 list for best rye of the year and maybe best whiskey of the year completely (too early to tell, lots of serious contender's coming out soon-- Cornerstone Rye, BTAC, OF Birthday Bourbon to name a few)

This is very close to last year's Thomas Handy in taste as far as rye goes.  My bet is if you tasted it blind you likely would not be able to quickly differentiate the two.  

The pro review on this one is not similar to my own.  But then again batch 1 was at 119.6 proof and this is 127!  Perhaps the higher proof cask strength makes all the difference. If you were to consider price here......which I never try to do as price doesn't necessarily equate to quality of taste, I would give a solid 5. Definate buy a bottle at 69.99.  This is a steal of a deal in todays market."

5.0,"perfection of the ""rye spice"" notes. Isnt overpowering in any way but does NOT hold your hand anywhere. Unashamed nose of apples and baking spice. Body was remarkably light (and accordingly smooth); ESPECIALLY at the proof. Remember, straight out the bottle this is 50% stronger than most watered-down brown.

finish wasnt long at all but has it's own interesting thing. Less menthol, more grass. The faint baking spice covers any hotter notes in the swallow.

9/10 would pound shots any night or consider it a respectable choice for nicer 'tails.

Single cube and it was way bolder with the spice taking on more of a forward presence in the sip. if Neat is Glen Campbell on vinyl, ice was like pandora on the wireless speaker on the backporch."

4.0,"This is the first cask strength American whisky I've had and only the second American rye that I've tasted, the first being Sazerac Straight Rye which was pretty darned good!
 I initially tried this straight up but found this to be way too hot at 60% ABV. After  adding 1 tsp water for a 1.5 oz serving I am finally able to appreciate this fine rye. 
My nose isn't working very well tonight, totally congested but there seems to be a pleasant, sweet raisin bun-like smell. On the palate there's lots of caramelized sugar, along with a nice amount of pepper and some vanilla. The finish is sweet menthol and medium length. 
The flavour profile reminds me a great deal of the Knob Creek Small Batch, but with more pepper up front. Very curious to try the Knob Creek Small Batch Straight Rye just to see how it stacks up. Especially since it is a very respectable 50% ABV a costs less than half the price here (49$)."

4.25,"Neat. Open for over a year.  Store pick.  Been a long time since I tried this Rye.  I can’t remember if I liked this or not even. Found the bottle hidden in the back of the shelf, so why not explore it before I bury it again.

Nose is light for cask strength, barely any alcohol burn even.  Jim Beam nuttiness is there in the background, which is fun on. Rye.  Lots of lightly toasted caramel and charred marshmallow, especially a lot of sweetness with a hint char.  The rye is mostly just a background note.  No dill or black licorice.  A nice peach, maybe even lemon with the acidity.  It’s lightening up over time and vanilla is emerging.  Really really pleasant and inviting rye.  I think this is barely legal rye and I could see it getting confused for a bourbon.

Texture is super oily, it costs so well.  Brown sugar and cinnamon initially, hint of that lemon even.  Much darker than I was expecting.  Charred caramel, undertones of nuttiness.  Legs are initially a blast of rye spice but really lighten up into vanilla and lemon.  Maybe even orange.  The longer I sit with it, I am getting a tannic aftertaste and dry mouth.  Some excellent flavor on this.  No idea why it got buried.

I’d put this right next to a Pikesville.  The base profile is more bourbon than rye, but the rye brings out these great sweet, citrus fruit notes you would never associate with a Knob Creek product.  Only knock is that lemon, acidity can come across as too harsh.  The tannic aftertaste takes away from the experience as well.  I can still see this in my Top 10 ryes under $75.  I’ll grab another store pick when this one is done."
