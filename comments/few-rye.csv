4.0,"Nose- black pepper, brown sugar and caramel
Body- sweet caramel mixed with strong mint, black pepper, lemon and oak char, rye spice really shines later
Finish- long with black pepper sugar and a hint of mint. 
Note- This is very good and smooth to drink. I think this is my second favorite rye to Whistlepig 100-100."
null,A smooth rye with just a little bite afterwards .... This small distillery gives us a big taste in an amazing way! Quickly has moved into my top 3 Ryes I've ever had!

4.0,"Been talking to my Dad and feeling a bit homesick, so I’m celebrating my home continent and switching to a rye whiskey this evening. I am trying FEW Rye because I heard good and not so good things about it. First, it is a fantastic teak oil color. The nose is a surprise for a rye whiskey that is 70% rye 20% corn and 10% malted barley. I thought it would be spicy, but the nose is very sweet, more similar to a bourbon. I definitely smell rye bread, green apple and nutmeg, but there is candied corn and demerara sugar as well. Wait a bit longer and there is unripe banana. In reality, this reminds me of Four Roses Small Batch Bourbon. Really a surprise. This is bottled at 46,5% ABV so the mouth feel is robust and not watery, yet there is very little burn. I get a lot of green apple, some more nutmeg and rye, as well as some nice oak flavor. The finish is oak and a nice spicy taste that lingers on the tongue with a bit of fresh mint. If you are looking for a spicy rye whisky this is not for you. Seriously, it is much more like a bourbon. Luckily, I like bourbon."

3.0,"For me judging rye whiskey is a challenge. Rye isn't my preferred style of
whiskey up front.  I find the heavy spice generally to be off putting and ""one
notey"". Rye fanatics would obviously vehemently disagree with my assessment,
but thats generally been where I land.

Diving into Few Rye Whiskey today, and apparently its won a few medals,
including Whiskey Advocate's ""Craft Whiskey of the Year"" award so I'm despite
my reservations I'm excited to give this a try.

Unexpected pickle note coming through first thing on the nose. The city I grew up in
was home to a heinz pickle factory and the nose on this brings me
back memories of driving past the pickle plant during the summer smelling the dill
permeating the air. Freshly cut lumber also makes an apperance. I'm being told I
should find caramel and brown sugar on the nose, but I'm struggling to pick those notes out
currently. I catch small hints of caramel being back there at times, but the note is
incredibly fleeting.

The taste of this is something special, this may change my opinions on rye
alltogether. The rye spice hits you as expected the moment it hits your palate,
but it quickly dissapates into a butter cream and caramel note through the
middle. The oak notes are all still there but not overpowering.

Adding water doesn't actually do much here. All the notes just have the volume
turned down a bit and I feel it was better at 46% abv.

I'm overall pretty pleased with this one, I could see myself picking up another
bottle to have on hand for the rare occasions I feel like drinking a rye...then
again, I rarely ever really feel like drinking rye."

The finish leaves a little to be desired but overall is something I would happily drink but not go out of my way to purchase. I'm not sure if it's the 20% corn that sneaks into the finish but something prevents it from being a smooth finish for me."

2.0,"Nose - pine tree, it's like nosing Christmas.  I'm as always not an expert on spices but this is just anything you could imagine with a Christmas tree and Christmas spices that nutmeg and cinnamon and whatever else makes it up.  Nice sweetness.  

Taste - SUPER spiced oak, vanilla, rye notes, Christmas cookies, some cookie dough, I wish I could nail this spice...not sure if it's ginger or something else.  It's POWERFUL and there's a LOT of it.  

This is some young whisky but boy oh boy did they find some magical oak casks.  

I'm not a rye guy, full FULL disclosure.  So I'm not getting another one of these, but I have really appreciated the uniqueness of this.  This is going to be a niche product and it's going to kill it for people who want these notes.  I'm going with a 2.0 as normally I'd score it lower because I think it's very niche but those who like it are going to really go for those oak and Christmas spice notes!"
