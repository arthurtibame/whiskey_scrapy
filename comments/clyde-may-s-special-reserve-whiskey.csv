4.0,Sweet and strong but smooth. Floral note... not happy about paying $18 for a glass tho.
4.0,"I'm not sure it's entirely fair to cast this as ""flavored whiskey."" That, to me, suggests a certain heavy-handed forcing of alien flavors into a whiskey. This isn't some kind of science experiment or adding flavored syrup, though. Clyde May's simply adds some oven-dried apples to the barrels...it just feels like a different kind of mindset than, say, Rebel Yell's root beer flavored ""whiskey."" Of course, maybe the difference here is that I like this one, but would generally turn my nose up at the genre of ""flavored whiskey""...so, perhaps I'm just trying to justify myself. At any rate, it certainly is not an unnatural flavoring - it smells like taffy apples, and tastes like a green apple inflected, spicy bourbon with a buttery mouthfeel and a surprising cocoa note that pops up. Personally, I enjoy it; the higher proof for the Special Reserve does give it a bit of extra oomph than the standard bottling (including a richer mouthfeel), but it feels a bit hot at 55% ABV. Not sure this is worth the usual $50-60 price tag, but at the 40% clearance rate...well, that I'm willing to pay."

2.0,"Super sweet! Strong Syrup smell, apple-y. High burn. Alright for a cocktail like a Manhattan or a spin on the old fashion which tend on the sweet side, but dont take it straight."

3.0,The nose is artificial cherry flavor and Play Dough. Very plastic smelling at first. Very smooth for a 110proofer.

4.0,"Nose - Ripe red apples, caramel, light vanilla, oak Taste - Red Apple, fruity, cinnamon, cow tail caramel candies, it finishes long with a light spice of rye and vanilla."

4.0,"On initial tastings, wasn’t feeling it. A lot of that, I suspect, was down to the bullshit marketing which underpins the Clyde May’s brand—it’s one of those brands who front like their product is deeply grounded in some rich history. It’s not. 

But now that the tedious marketing is at the back of my mind, I’m enjoying the product. There’s an oaky, smokey apple on the nose, and it follows through to the tongue. The finish is briefer than ideal, beyond a lingering top note of candy apple rye. 

I’d prefer the producers spent more time and money on production rather than marketing, but I guess my issues are with capitalism rather than the bourbon."
5.0,Very smooth! just what I was hoping for.

3.0,"Bourbon Tasting @ TW.
Decent enough change of pace sipper. It is definitely on the sweeter side and the apple influence is pronounced. There is also some nice spice to help balance the whiskey out. Not one I could have multiple pours of, but would make an occasional after dinner pour. 3.5/5."

5.0,"Hidden gem. Balanced smell (rich and smooth), great flavor (fruit, nuts, light smoke, butterscotch), clean and smoky aftertaste. Very pleasantly surprised by this drink. Very easy to over consume. Dangerously smooth, great overall balance, and 110 proof to boot. Overall score 96/100. Pick one up before price increases."
1.0,Tastes like they dropped in an apple jolly rancher. Not natural apples tasting at all.

4.25,55% ABV Alabama style whiskey infused with dried apples and cinnamon. The additions are not at all overwhelming and create a delicious flavor profile. Super good. Reminiscent of some of the better High West bottles. 4.25.

3.0,this review is for the 100 proof painted label.  strong fruit notes but not as strong as the 85 paper label.  seems they don't have a lot of continuity between batches.  really 3.5.
4.0,"Candy apple nose.  Pronounced apple note with cinnamon, vanilla, and high proof bite.  Finish is stewed cinnamon apples.

Very good."

0.5,"My first review on Distiller, despite being an avid whiskey drinker and collector. I received this as a gift - so it was free - but wanted to review it to help my fellow man who is spending money on a new whiskey. Do not buy this. It is god awful. From nose to finish, it is just cheap whiskey that should be in a plastic bottle. The added green apple and cinnamon are forward, but not strong enough to cover the astringency of the juice behind it. This calling itself whiskey is the same as fireball calling itself whiskey."

3.25,Decent. There's better to be had at the price though.
3.0,"Buttery and sweet. Oddly, I don’t get a ton of apple. Finish is a little medicinal, but that’s probably just me. When my palate is off, most bourbon tastes like cough syrup."

3.5,"Fun. Not much burn and caramel apple very up front for a 110 proof. Definitely ok with a large ice cube, you won’t miss any complexity. It’s apple. But, an easy end to a nice dinner while others enjoy their desert. I wouldn’t have it in my ‘tight’ collection, but glad I tried it."

4.0,Also fantastic and I did get that one.
3.5,It tastes a little earthy and dried apple. It is a decent whiskey but not sure it deserves 96 rating

4.5,Had the 110 Alabama style special reserve. Really great pour. Nose of cherry and vanilla. Taste brings orange peel and butterscotch. Floral notes retro.
