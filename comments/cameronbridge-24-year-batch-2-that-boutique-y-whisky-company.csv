4.0,"Another distillery I haven't tried and  another combined Grain/Boutique-y whisky combo success! A 24 year old for around $80USD - seriously try and beat that in the single malt world! This is a bit like that Girvan I liked with the vanilla, butterscotch, cherry flavour combo but better. I couldn't drink a lot of it as 'that cherry flavour' as I call it is a bit offputting to me similar to lemonly peatyness or bitterness (but not as bad). Still perfect balance, smooth for 50.7% and I did try this after Black Art 4.1 and Dalmore Cigar and it held up. 4 - 4.25 I'll give it. 171 bottles so get in quick  (I'm not sure how they make money on such a limited run?)"
