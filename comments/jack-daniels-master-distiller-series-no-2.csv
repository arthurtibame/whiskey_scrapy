4.5,"This 43% ABV expression of Jack Daniel’s Old Number 7 is beautiful. Hard to find, but if you can get your hands on it very much worth the investment.

On the nose: Strong and powerful notes of sweetness. Banana, caramel, brown sugar. Extremely inviting.

On the palate: Nose elements all present in spades. Beautiful flavour escalates slowly as you move a small amount around the back of your tongue for several seconds before swallowing. Liquid gold.

I recommend a first small sip, not held in the mouth for very long. Then have a good sip of water. Palate should be primed for a great experience now as you slowly enjoy this dram. Each taste gets better and better as you go."

3.75,Shame. Really wasn’t impressed. Much prefer Jack Daniels single barrel for about the same price.

4.0,"Been drinking Jack for a while now. This series is smoother, richer, and more complex. It still leaves a little bit on the back end, so that you know what you are having."

5.0,"The first pour of this is not anything special. But, pour a glass, close the bottle, wait two weeks, and revisit. The transformation is unbelievable. It turns into buttered waffles with maple syrup, nuts, and spices. My palate leaves something to be desired after years of cigar smoking, but this certainly doesn't suck!"

4.0,"This is a much perfect iteration on the old number 7. Much sweeter, more soft and more mellow. Liking this one."
