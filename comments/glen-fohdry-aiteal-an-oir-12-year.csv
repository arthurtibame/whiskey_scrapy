4.0,"Solid scotch at a great value! The nose screams Sherry aging, but none is listed on the bottle! Full body, solid balance of malt, fruity, oak, and mild peat, slightly sweet. The non-chill filter is an awesome effect! Heavy and full flavor! Almost tastes like the best aspects of Glenlivet, Macallan, and Balvenie hooked up to create this single malt! This easily drinks like it should cost at least $20 more than I paid!"

4.0,"This is great value. Tastes like a sherry bomb even thought it doesn’t say it’s been in anything but bourbon casks. Non-chill filtered, 47% for under $40! Could pass for a 12 yr old Macallan at twice the price."

3.5,"Let this one breath a long time.
Salted carmel, apples and oak on the nose, the salted Carmel and apples continue on the creamy palate, the finish is hot for a 12 year old, oaky and medium length.
A splash of water turns everything oaky, better off without it."

4.0,An oakey nose with a slight hint of sweetness and tart apples. The taste is lightly smokey with a nice speyside saltiness running through it.
