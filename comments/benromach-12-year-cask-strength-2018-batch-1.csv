5.0,"Nov 2019.
Clear deep gold to amber.
Powerful sweet px Sherry, fruity vintage port, late bottle vintage port, wild berries, burned apple wood, Christmas cake, sweeten dark plum, sweeten roasted dried prune and strawberry jam in nose.
Dry full body with fruity oaky smoky vanallic sweety warm rich flavor with lots of Sherry sweet and lingering bruned campfire in the after taste.
Ludicrous fruit bomb with gentle lingering smoke finish.
Outstanding batch."
