2.0,"Not a fan of this one, but that's not to say it isn't good (my partner likes it just fine). The walnut flavor is pretty strong so it limits the ability to use this in cocktails calling for bourbon. Wouldn't buy again, but if you're a big walnut fan, you might want to give it a go (just don't plan on it replacing a standard bourbon)."
4.5,"Very nice balance of nutty and sweet, a real treat!!"
3.5,Nice smooth flavors enjoyed neat.
4.0,Spicy up front with a smooth finish.
3.75,Very smooth and sweet. Would be a very nice desert drink. I would definitely drink again.
4.5,"Very smooth, nutty flavorful, and perfect for my sweet tooth!  Definitely would have enjoyed a second pour!"
4.0,"Tasted neat: a little spice up front, a little sweet, nutty, and smooth on finish with a hint of spice at the very end. Taste lingers a little and is a bit sweet.
Drank on the rocks: the spice is gone 
leaving only the smooth slightly sweet nutty flavor. The walnut syrup barrels 
cannot be missed here if you’re a fan of sweeter taste. Would definitely drink during and after a meal but would probably end up with an empty bottle by the end of the night. 
Very nice!"
4.0,Great nutty flavor all the way through and finishes very smooth. Could have had more than one glass of this!
4.25,Nice initial note you can taste the syrup first on your tongue. Turns into a smooth bourbon. Can taste the walnut all the way through. Don’t love the taste that lingers but great overall
4.5,"Nice mild taste of maple , smooth rich taste."
