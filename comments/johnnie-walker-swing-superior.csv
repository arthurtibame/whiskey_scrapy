4.25,"Yesterday i received a surprise birthday party and i opened one of my relics, a bottle of Swing Superior. Nobody knows too much about this bottle but it is supposedly from the 90s. Actually a very fancy easy drinking whisky, bottled at 40%abv, with caramel color.

On the nose Creme brulee, Acetone, Lemon, Vanilla, a typical JW.

On the palate, Cake, Tobacco, Slight peat and biscuits. Finish allspice very pleasant very complex. Really a wonderful aftertaste. 

Overall i give this ""rarity"" an 89 over 100. Good dram without having to overthink it too much."
