4.0,[Whiskey Live NY 2018] - I'm very impressed with the distilleries' ingenuity on this one.  I would like to hunt down a bottle for myself as a benchmark in the newest direction in Irish Whiskey maturation!

5.0,"second tasting notes. 

Amcal jelly beans again on the nose, but major peach and green apple on the nose. Loads of confectionery flavours on the palate with a sweet fairy floss flavour on the finish"

Tastes very much the same but with less wood smoke and a medium finish."

4.25,"nose is floral, mellow, corn, ripe red berries, vanilla, maple. Body is super heavy, clean grains, toffee, floral honey. Finish is a rollercoaster, a quick punch of spice, mellows out, and then a gentle warmth. Grapes, very slightly woodsy, slightly minty, tart red berries."

3.0,"Amazing nose.  Think sandalwood incense.  Like the Jain temples in India.  Very perfume-y, floral, aromatic.  
Taste is several notches below the aroma.  I’m not convinced mizunara + triple distilled works well.  I think mizunara needs a heavier stronger spirit to carry it ( like Yamazaki ).  

Nonetheless, in last night’s tasting at @Richard-ModernDrinking’s, this held its own against better stronger lineups from Michter, Ardbeg, and Octomore.  

Decent pour, with the nose being worth the price of entry."
2.25,"The nose is, easily, my favourite part of this, an amazing pine forest smell so reminiscent of bourbon, freshly cut green apples and a little sweetness towards the end. The palate has almost too much going on, savoury and bitter with vanilla, oak, hints of pineapple and coconut. A medium, bitter, oily, spicey finish. Don't shoot me here but I really feel this needs water to tame its harsher qualities."

4.5,"this is the best irish whisky i have ever tasted so far! 
it has the typical irish whisky notes, but the mizunara oak adds a very interesting layer to the whisky, definately a whisky you should try.
If you find this whisky, you must try it!
The tasting notes from the distiller app are very accurate, if they sound attractive, than this is your whisky!"

4.0,"This is a really unique whisky; unlike anything I have tasted before. It’s taken a few drams for my palate and brain to calibrate it. But now it’s gone from interesting to very enjoyable. 

The nose tells me right away this is going to be a different experience. There are strong aromas of sandalwood, pine needles, salty sweet caramel ... almost like fiddle faddle, cheerios, and some citrus - but not fresh fruit, more like Tang. 

On the palate, I’m instantly hit with the taste of the Mizunara - the wood oils coat my tongue, and then comes more citrus but now fresher, like tangerines. I also get a lot of creamy notes - mango, butter cookies, and ohi’a lehua blossom honey. 

The finish is oak, oak and more oak ... that Mizunara hangs around for days.

The Irish-Japanese hybrid is really well done. Looking forward to seeing how the bottle evolves over time."

4.0,"On the weekend before St. Patrick’s Day, amidst the Covid-19 paranoia (does everyone have enough toilet paper?), I pour myself a dram of this Irish whiskey thatwas generously provided by long time Distiller mate (to everyone) @PBMichiganWolverine  I truly enjoy a good Irish whiskey.  They are often overlooked and sometimes judged against its neighbors spirit, which one may be missing out on some good enjoyment from the other side of the sea.

A Lightly copper colored spirit  that opens with a raw sourdough with vanilla, honey, floral, orchard fruits, tropical fruits with a bit of baking spice. More specifically, honeysuckle with Fuji apples and toasted coconut, caramel, apricots, mangos all sprinkled with nutmeg.  A very aromatic nose. 

On a creamy body, flavors of the Mizunara (as I learned what this wood imparts). Vanilla, fresh fruit (cocktail): pears, apples, vanilla and honey.  Baking spices begin to kick in as it begins to fade:  fresh nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon and wood spices which gives the palate a mild tingling. 

Drying wood tannins with a touch of black cherry, black pepper and orange rinds provides a long finish. 

A fantastic opening which is embodied on the palate.  The lighter flavors imparted from from the Mizunara puncheon barrel provides a powerful influence, but not overpowering, on the gentle Irish distillate.  Aromatic and flavorful with a nice woody finish.  Japanese and Irish.  If you like Irish whiskey, this will not disappoint.  In the ranks of Green Spot and Redbreast, but the former can be had at a third to half the cost. Still quite good, though. [Tasted: 3/14/20][89/100]"
