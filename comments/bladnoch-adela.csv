4.5,"Wow, what life and richness! Martinelli's and apricot are nested among almonds with a little coconut. There are some spices and the flavor is rich and delicious. This tastes like a premium Scotch with its delightful balance of flavors and couple of punches of excellent flavor. It may not be perfect, but it's hard to come up with something more successful. This is to Macallan 15 as Macallan 15 is to Green Spot. It's a stunning masterpiece from an unexpected place. It is less I -your-face than Macallan 15 is, but it is more balanced and rich. The flavors develop over the sip, increasing the complexity. It's tasty like Glenfarclas 25, but less dry. The spices add interest and tend a bit toward ginger, but this is not as dry as Glenfarclas 25. There are plenty of baking spices and the wood is prominent, making it taste and look
at least 5 years older than it actually is and maybe even 10 years older. It's really quite a find. It's super good.
It smells scotchy with a little bit of sweet red fruit and some nice almond bordering on marzipan. The nose also has some rich truffle. There's some initial harshness on the palate, but it quickly gives way to complex flavors. There are some of those mineral elements that often bring out gross bread, but not in a bad way. It's a bit harsher than expected, but the complexity is there and it is quite balanced. There are notes of cherry and almond that are quite nice.
There's a nice balance here with quite a bit going on. Spice leaps out with some harshness. There are some smoky, seaside notes too and the barrel plays a big part in developing the backdrop. Almond comes in nicely, giving the flavor a richness. The sherried backdrop is quite tasty as well, though I'd like it a bit darker. There is leather, but it is far from overwhelming.
The nose reminds me of Westward and the Bladnoch 17. It has some smoke and overripe fruit with some malt and sweet caramel with a little bit of wood. The palate is nicely woody with fruity sweetness and malty richness. Some hints of milk chocolate come in and there's a good balance of spiciness making it taste full and rich. There's so much flavor and complexity here. It sometimes doesn't all quite fit together beautifully, but it swirls in a decadent and interesting manner. If be delighted to sip this. There's a bit of butterscotch to the caramel, but I would have liked it to be more. There's some nice mild leather in with the smoke that blends with the tannins smoothly. Some raisins, dried figs, and dates all come out. I would have preferred a slightly different flavor profile, but it's complex and interesting with a solid richness (at least for its age). The fruitiness with the richness and the sweetness and balanced spice is really nice. This is truly an enjoyable scotch to drink."

4.25,Dramfest 2020. I'm quite liking Bladnochs offerings. They don't blow you away but still very decent if overpriced drams.

4.5,"Spiced fruits and dark chocolate on the nose with a hint of caramel. 

Very rich spiced fruit taste with a dark chocolate undertone. Very smooth, minimal heat. 

Short finish and a lingering spice."

4.25,"Nose - Cherry & strawberry cough drops, canned cranberry sauce, dark honey, dark toffee

Taste - Sweet cherry/strawberry/fresh dark stone fruits, hint of dark chocolate, dark toffee, light candied ginger spice, light stone fruit pit bitterness on backend

Finish - Long lasting dark stone fruit sweet, hint of bitterness lingers, light white pepper tingle, cocoa nib bitterness

Score - 84/100

Final Thoughts - The nose on this one screams dessert dram. I have a feeling this would be the perfect pairing to a dark chocolate cake or anything else that has some sort of berry compote to help complement the light bitterness that this dram has with it. The nose is great but can probably get a bit overwhelmingly sweet for some. Starts out great on the tongue, but transitions to this light metallic bitterness that I occasionally get with some oloroso finished Scotches.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe, with dessert

Would I buy a bottle? - Probably not another"
