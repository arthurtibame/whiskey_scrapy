3.25,"At 53% it's a barely legal rye, it tastes good, but not my preference for a rye. The nose has hints of vanilla and pepper to me. Taste is pretty mild, I wish it was a little spicier. Much prefer Bulliet Rye to this, but it still a good whiskey."
3.75,Sweet fruit or raisin and vanilla on the nose. Brown sugar and barrel char up front followed by baking spices. A pleasant lingering mouth burn and spice finish. For a rye more sweet than spicy.
4.5,"An elegant rye with very rich mouthfeel, complex nose and a long, slightly ryed finish. Perfect sipping whiskey."

3.75,"Exceeded expectations with this Woodford Rye guy pickup.

Neat

Nose: sweet spicy cherries at the rim. Time gets you the vanilla oaky chocolate. Think Christmas pine background with cherry ambrosia, if we are letting the mind travel a bit. It’s a great nose!

Palate: Nice change up! Tart, apricot dried or unripe fruit upfront. Young, so not the most smooth compared to something with an older age statement. Also not getting a ton of chocolate, but overall a pretty good rye for a rainy day.

2.25,"The third and most recent edition to the standard lineup, this is also the distillery's first wide release of rye whiskey.  They promote it as a ""sipping"" rather than mixing rye, but I was quite disappointed in it.  Perhaps it was just because my senses were exhausted at the end of a long day, but I got very little out of this expression.  Its nose is faint and demure, with a young bourbon character rather than the bold, spicy rye impact I'd expect.  The palate is more of the same, with light simple syrup and honey flavors with just a bit of rye.  This is a kiddie-pool or training-wheels rye, inoffensive but not close to worth the $40 sticker price.  Go for Old Overholt any day of the week, even as a ""sipping"" whiskey."
2.25,Tasted while camping and didn’t take notes. Recall it being very bland and uninspiring.

4.25,"I've found it to be a very subtle rye - not overpowering your senses with spice - and I would guess that this is what Woodford Reserve had in mind by producing this with a lower rye percentage than is the norm.  If you enjoy ryes as I do, this definitely deserves a spot on your shelf."

3.5,"Nose features a moderate strength aroma of cedar wood, rye seeds, ripe pear, and black pepper. 

Palate features undefined cereal grain, honey, and black peppercorn, leading to a mid-palate of cherry liqueur and wood that is equal parts oak and cedar. Kind of missing the bready note I have enjoyed in other ryes. Not very herbal, and more sweet than spicy.

Mouthfeel light and airy (not a bad thing given the flavor profile). Overall finish is short and very mild with no burn whatsoever, with a lingering spearmint note that remains after all other flavors are ancient history. 

There's nothing off putting here, but also nothing to write home about. Slightly misses the mark for what I am looking for in a rye. At $35, it is an ok value but when you consider that Rittenhouse and baby Saz are considerably cheaper, well...this probably doesn't make the cut for re-buy status for me."

Overall, this is a pretty solid Rye."

4.25,"The color is a deep amber with thick oils that coat the glass. The nose has a gentle, floral rye spiciness, with chocolate milk, vanilla, oak and a touch of cereal. The palate is rich, soft and oily and coats the mouth with rye, nicely balanced by the chocolate milk as oak and vanilla are present underneath. The finish features more oak, while the rye, vanilla and chocolate milk come together for a medium long finish that fades nicely. 

The aftersniff is reminiscent of grandma pearl’s homemade potpourri that has settled in the back of her sock drawer for 4 years. The bouquet is a rich mix of canned cherry pie filling and soft serve vanilla ice cream from ponderosa. Subtle sniffs of carrion and patchouli round out the scent."

4.0,"Full disclosure, I’m a Scotch whisky drinker first and foremost, then Irish, then rye, then bourbon.  And I rate all whisky/whiskey on how it is neat, and think that rye is typically better suited for cocktails than sipping, most especially for an Old Fashioned (my primary drink after a neat whisky).  So with all that said, I will say 1) this makes a great Old Fashioned, and 2) it is the best sipping rye I’ve ever had.  I find that as I get older, I prefer less sweet libations, hence rye beating out bourbon...but even still, many ryes can be a little harsh since they are spicy by nature.  The Woodford, however, is an extremely well balanced rye, spicy and sweet in perfect measures and one of the few I will sip neat.  The nose is very nice and reminds me of the sweet straw smell of walking through a field of ripe grain.  On the tongue it’s fruity and peppery in a surprisingly complimentary fashion.  It will never beat out a great single malt whisky, but as ryes go, you won’t do better."

3.5,"Golden color.  The pour smells like walking into a bakery - toasted rye and yeast hit the nose.  In the glass the aroma is sweeter, more caramel with the rye in the background.  The palate is lively and spicy with classic Woodford tannins in play as well. Another nosing with the palate tingling gives more hints of vanilla.  The second sip gives rise to more new oak and plum sweetness.  The spice is still there but plays out as a constant tingle on the tongue.  The third sip is sweater yet with baking spice on the back.

Relatively smooth, there’s never much burn or ethanol.  In a lot of ways this represents what Woodford should have been all along for me.  The copper pot stills and short finish remind me of Irish whiskys in a way.  The spice is well balanced, not what I’d expect fro a rye wiskey but also a very easy sipping pour."

So Chris Morris didn't want Woodford Rye to be just another green labeled bottle, and that may have just worked out.   The great tastes that taste great together, bourbon and rye are pretty well cobbled together here, off the top I get the expected redhot-cinnamon and clove rye warmth but also a nose full of sweet vanilla and caramel notes with some malted milk thrown in just to make sure my sweet tooth is satisfied.  A distinct cola-cake thing going on which I never liked cola-cake when I was kid, but now I'm thinking it's not so bad. 

Now the rye purist may balk at that sweet cinnamon mouth full and again that cola-cake taste, a tad of orange citrus sweetness with just a hint of spearment bubblegum as the warm amber juice fades out in  the end.   This is some pretty unique stuff going on even high rye bourbons don't usually come near, but as we can expect from Woodford, with plenty of good things going on there is also a distinct lack of anything bad.  The finish is incredibly smooth and just leaves me wanting another sip to remind me how gorgeous this concoction truly is.   Perhaps not a purists favorite rye but certainly a bourbon lover rye, this green labeled bottle should turn heads. cheers!"
4.5,"After reading good reviews, I picked this up on the way to the weekend at the lake. Store had it on sale for less than $40. Wonderful full body body whiskey with an nice oak and char start, mellowing into a sweetness that delitefully lingered on the tongue."
3.75,"If you like Ryes but want a little more sweetness and less bite, this fits your bill. If Ryes aren't your favorite, but you'd like to have one in the cabinet, this fits your bill. If you love Ryes, you might be a little disappointed in how sweet it is, but your wallet won't hurt at this price. Doesn't blow anybody away but hits a target in the market that many will enjoy."

4.25,"Nose: Classic rye notes but they are soft by design. The herbal quality is there, slight hint of dill and other green herbs. Some apple and pear too with a little tobacco.

Palate: again soft and well rounded. Apples, vanilla, and honey. Very delicate for a rye, but the spice and herbs still show up just not as bold as some high rye whiskeys. A crowd pleasing rye that would be great in a cocktail.

Finish: medium finish with some spice lingering and hints of tobacco, leather and honey. If you search you can find some more flavors hanging around, but I wish the finish were longer.

I am usually completely unbiased in my reviews, but I bumped into Woodford Master Distiller Chris Morris in a package store in Atlanta while he was in town for an event. He put this bottle in my hands so this bottle is going to always be a little special because of the story behind me finding it. He says it was intended to be a softer rye. Mission accomplished! 

At the price point you won’t be disappointed and it is a great introduction to rye if you are looking to get your feet wet without melting your face with an herb bomb. Are there better ryes a little cheaper? Yes, a few, but you can also do a lot worse at double and triple the price of this one."

4.0,"This is a tasty whiskey.  This is definitely more of a bourbon drinker’s rye, something to transition someone over to the wonderful world of rye.  The nose is quite pleasant, floral and light, with vanilla and burnt caramel creeping in. I was surprised by the lack of rye spice (pepper or cinnamon even) on the nose.  The palate is fruity and light again, with some crisp sour apple that turns in to a white pepper and rye spice.  A pretty decent finish, with white pepper on the front, and a heat that hits your chest that is definitely not from the proof.  Very small taste of the barrel on the back end of the finish, turning back in to a strong taste of sweet burnt sugars as it fades out.  After the finish is gone, I am left with wondering how they got a ‘rye’ so light and sweet. Probably a little young, and the 53% rye is the answer to that.  

Overall: for $34 this is tasty and reasonably smooth, if albeit a little light and simple. I wish there was more oak or deep rye flavors to help balance out the light floral/sweet/fruity tastes.  I will definitely try a barrel select and see if this answers that complaint. I wouldn’t call it overpriced, but there are definitely cheaper bottles out there that I personally think deliver more. But get this as a bourbon drinker’s first rye, and you won’t regret it."

4.25,Excellent value for a sipping rye.  The mash bill has removed all the edges so great for new rye drinkers.  Just brought my 6th bottle as friend keep enjoying.

3.75,"Plenty of stiff woody oak and a good amount of spicy rye. Hints of cinnamon, black pepper, vanilla, caramel, and tobacco. Fairly dry. Decent go-to rye."
4.0,I’m a rye guy that likes standard woodford during the warmer months. Very excited to finally try this rye. Good heat for such a low rye %. Moderately fruity sweet. Nice long chocolaty and oaky finish.

3.75,"When I am in the mood for something other than bourbon this is a great alternative. The subtle rinse of rye gives a nice spice flavor and oh so smooth. However, if I am in the mood for a more traditional strong proportioned rye I would reach for something  else, but I love this rye for what it is."

3.5,"This is a good, but not a great rye. It works brilliantly in cocktails, but on its own it lacks a bit of spice I look for in a rye. Its flavour is closer to a high rye bourbon than to an actual rye. 3.5/5 or 82/100"
4.0,Spicy.
