4.0,"Received as a gift.
Nose: aroma of pecans, vanilla, cherry. Very pleasing!
Palate: sweet, notes of creme brûlée, vanilla, mild hint of smoke, and subtle flavor of toffee.
Finish: mouthfeel was subtle, after the flavors of each sip passed, there was little aftertaste. Very little alcohol burn. 
Overall: great introduction from this distiller. Possibly more time in the barrel may lend to a different flavor profile, but this current offering has plenty to offer. Thoroughly enjoyed this dram!"
