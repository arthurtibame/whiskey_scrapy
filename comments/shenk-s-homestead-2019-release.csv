4.0,Now that the bottle's been open for a few days there's a more dominant sugar and nuttiness. Incredibly drinkable! Still the most oily bourbon I've experienced
3.75,"N: Sweet vanilla with some barrel char
P: Creamy toffee with some smoke
F: Mid-length with some heat"
4.0,A taste with Jerad. A cherry bomb.

4.5,"Oh wow.

Don't let the nose fool you. This smells very light and unimpressive but the taste is there to back up the value and reputation of this bottle.

Flavor-wise, this is a marshmallow bomb, with a medicinal/herbal edge followed by a touch of spice and hard candy - the kind grandmothers keep in their purse wrapped in strawberry patterned foil.  There's a soft cocoa-y oakiness in the finish. I heard French Oak was used in the 2019 release. 

Because of the low proof, this is not as good as and does not hold up against some of the big flavor bombs or even the exceptional bottles in the 107 to 116 proof range... but this might be the best sub-100 proof bottle I've ever had."
4.75,"No age statement but it has plenty of oak and leather on the nose which makes me think it is maybe around 10 or more years old. I tend to like aged bourbon flavors and this has some nice notes of well aged whiskey. There's also bold notes of brown sugar, dark honey, orange, maple syrup, cinnamon, and nutmeg. 

On the palate more oak notes with brown sugar, dark honey, rye spice, milk chocolate, and some smoke. Next it leans to the fruity side with orange citrus and cherry , finally finishing with some straw, malt, and more milk chocolate. Finish is pleasantly long and complex

Very bold and expressive nose on a bourbon with a lower proof. I love the balance on the palate that includes some of those well aged notes of oak and leather and notes of orange, honey, and cherry. This is on my shortlist of favorites right now."
