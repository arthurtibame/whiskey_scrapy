4.0,"I liked it better with a large cube - seemed to open it up and bring on a sweeter note.
Good, but many better options at the $60 price point."
3.0,"Wood notes, deep honey, some herbs, char. Good notes. Seems young initially, with musty damp wood and sweet corn. Some floral notes. Then spice kicks in, and baking spice lingers. At the end, cacao nibs and oddly a flash of pineapple. 9/9/18"

3.5,I love anything that tastes like licking a piece of vintage furniture and this bottle is THERE. Even the nose = “antique store.” Put it in my veins.

4.0,I enjoy this bourbon. It is a smooth drinker.
2.0,"Get the mocha, but the lower proof makes the finish thin and weak"

4.0,"Nose of peanut brittle and brown sugar. 
Flavor salted and briney.  Dry and long finish."
3.0,"At opening: weak nose with lots of barrel, slight spice and floral notes are dominated by pure sweet corn on the palate, finish is special--lots of rich toasted oak and dark chocolate.

One week later: MUCH better balance on the palate, with the complexity coming out and much better marriage of flavors.  Finish is still strong.

If you're a collector, buy this for the special finish.  If you're not, there are many better ways to spend your money at this price."

3.0,"I usually have bourbon with a cube of ice but when I tried this one with a cube it really took away the flavor to the point I was disappointed.  Tried it neat afterwards and it was much better, still not one of my favorites."

3.75,Three distinct flavors.. sip slowly. Made with waved barrels like Jack Sinatra.
2.25,"This pour is complicated to say the least. 

Nose: Terrible. Varnish and oak. It reminds of that terrible Tim Smith Wood-fired moonshit, er shine. 

Palate: Better than the nose. Lots of wood and vanilla. 

Finish: Soft and lingering with cinnamon and vanilla. 

Conclusion:  The finish is where this shines. I really hope this oxides nicely like the OF 1910. Otherwise, I totally wasted $80. Fuck!!"

3.75,"Jefferson's does it again.  This is really good. I have no idea how sourced juice continues to turn out so good, but keep it up Mr Zoeller.  I still feel the Jefferson's line is overpriced, but I cannot doubt it's goodness.  This is not as good as the Ocean Voyages I have sampled, but it is $25 less.  It also has more oak notes and more depth of flavor.  I believe it is a fair trade off.  If you can get a bottle on sale, don't pass.  Thanks @ridethalightin for sharing."
4.0,"This is actually quite nice.  Apple, caramel, oak, vanilla.  Flavor balloons with toasted oak.  Adds depth.  $60 price point is a bit heavy-handed, but it is a good pour."
