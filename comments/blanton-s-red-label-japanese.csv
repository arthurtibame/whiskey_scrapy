3.75,"Nose- Sweet cherries, citrus, vanilla, bubble gum

Palate- Bubble gum sweetness initially, citrus, tiniest bit of oak

Finish- medium, oily finish with notes of sweet citrus


A bit simple. Enjoyable pour, but not overly complex and the 2 year age increase from original blanton’s isn’t noticeable in the slightest to me. All sweetness on the nose, a bit of oak on the palate, and a forgettable finish."

4.5,"Tasting Blanton's Red & Black side by side both are solid, the Black is a little watered down/thin for my taste, but has a nice finish. Definitely prefer the Red, with a minimum 8 year age requirement,like it much better than the American version."
