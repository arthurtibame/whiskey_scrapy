null,I tried the 1998. It was too sharp for me.
4.0,"Ripe melon, toffee, and oak on the nose. Medium bodied, with grapefruit, papaya, guava, licorice, and baking spices on the palate. The finish is spicy, citric and of medium length. Complex, tasty and worth trying."
3.0,"I'm on the fence on this one. It's a perplexing single malt, and I think sherry casks would have helped"

5.0,An absolute gem and one of my top 5. Rich mouthfeel due to cask strength but not hot. Official tasting notes have a lot of breakfast terms like pancakes and syrup which are not wrong but missing the great peat kick at the end that provides character.  Complex and layered but accessibl. Glad I got two bottles.
5.0,Still having trouble distinguishing between peaty and smokey. It says lightly peated but seems just tasty to me. Pancakes filled with layers of baked bananas and toffee sauce???? Who writes this stuff on the label? I just taste strong alcohol content and really nice flavour....
