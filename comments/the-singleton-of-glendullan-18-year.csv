3.0,"Smooth and deep flavour. Good balance of sherry, vanilla and toffee flavours."
2.0,"Very mid nosing, cereal in the hands, in the glass cherries.  The taste is the best part with nutty and malty.  A long finish."

2.0,Lightest tasting whisky of any kind I have ever had. Extremely light  and flavor profile to go with it. Great  whisky to introduce Scotch to people who do not like whisky....such as your Wiffee/GF . Will not be buying again and I can see this bottle ending up in the back row of my collection so may last for 10-20 years or longer as I will not be reaching for it very often.

4.5,"Soft, smooth, banana, aroma"
3.25,An enjoyable dram. Butterscotch on the nose. Cotton candy with a hint of peat on the palate. Contains this “oiliness” usually associated with Glenfiddich. I felt the finish was a bit too short for my liking.
4.5,"Oak, vanilla, cream soda, pear, toasted coconut"
4.25,"Rich vanilla, oak and ceylon tea. Roasted malt aftertaste, considerable spicyness"

1.75,"What's the point of this whisky @ 40 % ?  May be good to introduce whisky to newborn infants or retirees after 80 who have to be careful drinking flavorful strong whiskeys but @ 40 % and such mild ,barely flavorful taste what is the point of this whisky?"
