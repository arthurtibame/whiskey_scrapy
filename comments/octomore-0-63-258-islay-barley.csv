5.0,"Oh, my Lord.  My wife and I, and some friends, went to Miami Whiskey Mash earlier this month and got to try some drams of this whisky.  To be honest, before this event, I was wondering what all the Octomore hype was about.  My initial encounter with Octomore was the 07.3, which I did not particularly enjoy, finding its flavor profile so strange that it almost didn't feel like a whiskey to me but more like a barrel-aged gin.  That really put me off this series, given its high cost and rarity.  Why hunt for something like that?

Well, mea culpa, now I have my answer.  Octomore 06.3 is a tour de force of a peated whisky, and famously was the peatiest scotch on the market before Bruichladdich outdid themselves recently with several outlandish releases in the 8th series.  Experiencing the peat of Octomore 06.3 is like hearing Beethoven's 5th for the first time:  wave after wave of pure, unadulterated power.  The hair was growing on my chest, my voice was deepening . . . like a 5-minute accelerated puberty redux, minus the acne and the intense awkwardness with girls.  Rich Cuban cigar smoke, freshly burnt-out candles, but balanced by -- actually, it's not much balanced out by anything.  And I love it.  The asphalt or rubber notes that feature in Lagavulin show up here as well, and there's some of that earthier or mossier peat.  It's a showcase for just about every flavor an enthusiast can find in a peated whisky.

Definitely the winner of the festival, by far, and one of my top three whiskies of all time."

4.5,Just tasted this for the first time. Blow your mind. Hit of sweet then the peaty smoke followed by some subtle brine and salt. Then the peat lingers. This was amazing. If I could find this I would buy as much as I could afford.

5.0,"I bought 2 of these beasts recently from Norfolk Wine and Spirits. There may only be a half dozen bottles of Octomore 6.3 left in the entire US and Norfolk still has a couple available. At 258 ppm, this spirit continues to hold the title for the “world’s most peaty!“  Norfolk’s owner, Bikram, not only gave me a great price, but he also offered a sample prior to purchase, and my first impression of this expression was even more profound than my earlier review of the Octomore 7.1 (208ppm). On the nose, there’s a wave of meadow fragrances and maritime peatiness that’s simply more complex and unique than any other Islay whisky. You can sense the peat sitting there like a powder keg under layers of citrus and honeyed vanilla waiting for the proper chemistry to release its wrath, the key to which I have yet to find. Incredibly smooth for an ABV of 64%, the first warming mouthful explodes into a 5-star constellation without hesitation and a fitting salute to an Independence Day celebration. The nose is carried to the palate but now the young peatiness is much more satisfying and elegant than what I found in the Octo7.1; seemingly still shackled, however, to maintain a proper level of grace. The finish is the home run ball you remember from your youth that carries the fence in slow motion and with a similar level of elation. After a little experimentation, a pile of ice was necessary to help put out the fireworks and cool the temperatures of a perfect day with family and friends. Hats off to retired master distiller, Jim McEwan, for one of his swan song creations."

5.0,"Much richer and deeper than you'd expect at 258ppm. Everything that I love about Port Charlotte was exponentially magnified, revealing a magnificently textured, complex dram--honey, salt, chocolate malt, green barley, black tea, picked herring, and a slight spice. The smoke and ash brooding underneath the palate, carrying it into a long full-bodied finish of honey, salted caramel, oil, and smoke. This was a beautiful whisky, easily one of my favorites from the distillery and my favorite Octomore bottling so far."

5.0,"This is hands down the best scotch I have ever had. I have seen that this stuff varies a lot batch to batch but I can say that this batch is a winner. If you see the 6.3, buy it. It is worth the price!"

4.75,"258 ppm....more need not be said.  Not only is it smoky and peppery on the tongue to an extreme, the finish might as well feel like your mouth is on fire (and should you exhale near an open flame, it might be).  In spite of that, the actual drink is remarkably smooth.  Rare, and delightful, if you ever have a chance."
5.0,"In some respects my critical faculties fail me when I taste Octomore. This is my favourite type of whisky, heavily peated Islay, at a ridiculous 258 ppm (remember Ardbeg is 55 ppm) and it tastes sublime. What’s not to like? And, shit, yes I’ll buy into the fact that terroir matters. Isla barley from Lorgba Field, Octomore Farm. Count me in. It don’t get much better than this. This one goes up to eleven, trust me,if you can find it."
