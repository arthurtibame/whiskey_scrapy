4.5,"This special scotch is a light straw yellow color with thin semi-watery legs.

The nose is delicious and overall dry and fruity, with notes including lemon zest, orchard fruit, dark juicy plum, fresh grass, cherry, peach, and a sweet note reminiscent of beer or whiskey fermentation.

The palate has notes of salted caramel, green apple, oak tannins, tart green grapes, banana bread, and sour candy.

The finish is moderate in length, tannic and fruity.

Sláinte!"
