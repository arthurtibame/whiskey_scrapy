4.0,"An amazing whisky. On the light side at first, but quickly fills your mouth with a lovely peppery herbal taste, followed shortly by a light peatiness that morphs it all into a green apple and pear pie party.  Well balanced, full spectrum, very approachable, all around amazing.
Nose: pear, white grape must, pepper
Taste: slight butter, peat, granny smith, pear, pepper
Finish: Slight salt/brine, peppered beef jerky, fruit overtone, some ash, with a honey undertone"

3.5,The non-distiller reviews were poor but it's not a poorly constructed dram. Very light ethereal peat...only 11pm but not that bad albeit from low expectations...
3.25,"Very unexpected and extraordinary.
It welcomes you with a smooth, milky aroma of almond, sweet citrus, ginger and of course peat and smoke (not very much - it is a case when peat turns really gentle) and leather.
And then the things get strange (in a positive way) - some classic creamy anCnoc notes undoubtedly (coconut palate and butter) mixed with amazing pepper, tar and bitumen taste, again peat and citrus.
Finish is also stubborn and deep - bitter tar and leather on the edges of the tongue with deep sweetness and cinnamon."
