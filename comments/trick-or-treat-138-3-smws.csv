Ooft!  The nose is mild and papery, but you take a sip and wow - peat and smoke smacks you in the face!

Hot, spicy, burnt wood.  There’s an almost meaty BBQ taste to this one neat.

A few drops of water dulls most of the smoke and brings out some light molasses flavours (almost like a rum).  It is a much easier drink with water and very pleasant to sip."
