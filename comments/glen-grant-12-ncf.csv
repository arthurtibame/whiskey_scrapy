4.0,"Having a travel retail exclusive version of 12 yo - 48% abv and unchillfiltered - and probably these are the main issues why GG12 seemed this highly appreciated.
The colour is pale wheat-y yellow.
To the nose - very light and gentle, floral, honey sweet with vanilla and cinnamon. Fruits dominate here - fresh pear, plum, apples. Sweetness implements in fruit paste with slight sour aroma. Even some olives and black olives are to be mentioned.
The taste is more biting than the aroma. Sour(!) green apples, also sweet mellow apples, gooseberry, some spices and vanilla.
Well, apples indeed! GG12 reveals much apple cider or more like apple brandy vibes what enhances its wonderful performance and reassures its succeeding ability to impress.
Finish is more sweet than sour as compared to the taste, heavier, sharper and imposing in a right way to say.
It obviously comes high above the expectations. One may expect a more gentle, calm character, wateriness, a mawkish taste. However, here we have a perfectly balanced and defiant in the same time Speysider but not a typical one though it might be easily considered as such.
The main highlights are its amazing sourness and the balance between drinkability and sharpness."
