4.0,"This whisky is like a novel where the author got distracted before the ending. It slowly builds, there is drama and an interesting climax and then no resolution, it just stops.

This whisky takes time to release its secrets. At first there is no nose, then with time it starts to open up. The first hint is vanilla, then comes citrus, orange zest mixed with lemon. Leave it for a bit more time then pineapple, coconut and cardamom appear. Finally comes some sherry. Each flavour coming in a wave one after the other

Palate: First hit was a big burst of spice mixed with sherry. Second sip is sherry, cinnamon, cardamom and clover, with a very slight toffee. Throughout there are some oak under currents. Actually very nice.  Adding water seemed to bring out some chocolate and turn up the sherry a bit. Personally, I preferred it without water.

The finish was a disappointment, almost nonexistent."

3.25,vrij gebalanceerd in neus en mond maar de afdronk is heel scherp en mist daardoor diepgang.
4.25,Honey and vanilla notes with some malt. Aroma has oak notes instead of malt.
