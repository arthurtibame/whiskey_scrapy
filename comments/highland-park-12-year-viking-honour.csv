Floral. Peat smoothed out by the sherry. Citrus comes through at the end. Luscious mouth feel. Lovely dram especially at this price point."

3.25,"A solid offering from HP. The Orkney peat and sherry cask flavors bounce off each other nicely. Long time fans claim this isnt as good as the pre-viking stuff but I’ve never tasted those. This is a solid malt to my tastes, definitely more happening than a standard highland malt."
4.25,A nice little bite of peat smoke that almost immediately fades away into salty yet slightly sweet flavors. A taste that reminds me of the foggy northern beaches of Iceland. Perfect introduction to peat.

4.75,"This is now the third whisky I intend to keep in my bar at all times (alongside the Glenfiddich 14 and Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban 14).  I was looking for a peated whisky to bring a little more smoke into my collection, and this one, while not overly smoky, is exactly what I was looking for.  It’s a remarkably balanced dram, just the right amount of peat seemlessly interspersed with notes of vanilla, honey and spice.  The 18 year expression is supposed to be exquisite, and if it’s even better than the 12, I might just have to make that a priority."

I get campfire smoke, green apple, lemon, and honey on the nose.  Starts sweet and creamy then moves into peat smoke and pineapple with baking spices on the finish and that lovely campfire smoke again.

There is a medium to long finish with the sherry coming through and lingering with a nice tingle on the sides of the tongue.  

I'm generally not a peated whisky fan, but this is delicious and adds a great complexity to this whisky. Definitely a great value and one I will plan to have as a staple for my cabinet!"

3.5,I was really positively surprised by this one. So much that I ordered the 18 years old one right after I tasted it. Its light peat aromas give it an interesting first impression on the nose but what comes after it is equally interesting and unique as well. It is an all-in-all good whisky which I assume will be very enjoyable for a wide range of whisky appreciators. They peat is definitely there but not overwhelming at all. I think it gives it its maturity. For a 12 years old whisky it really has something to offer that many equally old ones can’t. Looking forward to other Highland Park whiskies.
4.0,"Nose: Oranges, honey, a little mild spice and fragrant smoke - almost like a sprinkle of the ash from a burnt sandalwood incense cone. There's a maritime quality as well, but it's light and fragrant rather than robust.

Palate: A seamless continuation from the nose with a sweet citrus and honey arrival backed by a soft malted cereal character. In the development (which can take a while) gentle smoky notes start to emerge along with some grassy and very subtle salt, and a hint of sherry. There's a little bit of spice that flares up in the development and the texture is silken all the way through.

Finish: Medium/short. Malt and honey and a very faint lingering touch of smoke.

When I first reviewed this whisky here 4 years ago I felt that it was going through a rather dull phase, as I'd had several bottles in a row over a few years that were pretty ho-hum. However this botting in the new ""Viking"" livery is pretty much right back to the old style. Seriously - it's very much the standard old 12 year old from 10 years ago in a new bottle, and that's a really good thing.

For a younger expression this benefits from at least 20-30 minutes resting in the glass (DO IT! you'll be glad you did).  Everything blooms most pleasantly. It's a subtle everyday dram with hidden complexity that you find yourself occasionally sniffing and thinking ""wow, this is really very good - I'm glad I bought it!"". However I don't think it should be over-rated either - it's very good, but not fantastic.

“Very Good” : a solid 4 stars"

3.0,"The long awaited highland park. Much has been said about this whiskey since I first came into the whiskey game last year. Hadn’t tried this but was finally able to get a bottle of it. Excited to try this dram. 

Nose: my initial smell gives me a lot of dried fruit smells indicative of single malts, some canned peaches, banana, browned apple, notes of honey. 

Taste: A lot of people say smoke, but that’s not at all what I get at all. I’m getting a lot of oak in the mids, leather, tobacco, black pepper spice on the end, the initial liquid on tongue is a short sweet honey that disappears really quickly. 

Mouthfeel: it’s soft, watery, sweet, and  short on entry that intensifies to a spicy heat that coats the tongue. It’s like spicy Mexican candy that tastes sweet on the initial taste but quickly builds to a heat. The heat here doesn’t last long though but gives a small peppery end that makes you wonder if you drank anything in the first place. 

That was an interesting experience. Typically it is said if whiskey that the tongue verifies what the nose already discovered. That is not true whatsoever for this dram. The nose and palate are 2 different things. I’m not sure yet how to score it. But as of first opening. It is not my first choice. I’d rather something a little sweeter or something islay that is truly smoke. This feels unsure of what it wants to be."

3.5,"On the nose it’s very sweet. The sherry cask aroma is prominent. The peat is there, lingering in the background but it is on its own different from the smoke most of us are accustom to. The Orkney Peat is much lighter, airy and heathery I suppose than its Islay brethren. On the palate, flavors of honey and vanilla with a twist of citrus spritz. A good texture with a warm slightly fiery finish that has some legs."

4.0,"Revisiting for (enjoyment and) some actual tasting notes which apparently I have eschewed in the past. Neat in a glencairn yields a rich orange hue. Not especially thick, but pleasantly oily on the glass.

An appealing yet convoluted nose. Tart and grainy, with sherry and peat. Orange, pineapple, and mango. A splash of vanilla and buttered walnut. Subtle and lilting spice that doesn’t quite build. Nutty sherry notes are ever-present but never play first chair.

The palate is sweet and creamy and evolves readily from tangy juicyfruit to a flash of peat smoke back to tropical fruits and vanilla almond creme. Lemon chiffon. A touch of astringency lingers with oak and citrus oils, but overall an elegant balance of sweet, peat, fruit, and a dash of bitter.

Zesty, sweet, rich, and smoked. Certainly won’t be for everyone, but the balance and complexity are lovely for an affordable 12 year. Not too concerned with the branding/packaging/etc debate; regardless of any aesthetic preferences, these cats know what they are doing when it comes to the whisky. My enjoyment of HP12 has built over time as I’ve evolved to accept modest peat as a seasoning that pairs quite nicely with sweeter, sherried whiskies. Yum."

This is a very approachable, well-balanced whisky that is not overly sweet or smoky. The peat is there but it never draws attention to itself. The slight orange aroma on the nose carries over to the taste as a pleasant addition."

The main note that i get from this nose is synthetic rubber. exactly like smelling a new inner tube of a bicycle. That main note is also a bot mixed with leather and dried cow manure. I dont like this at all, but 14 years ago i said the same thing about Islay scotch... 
There is a sweetness behind the rubber, with hay and citrus and a lot of caramel malt. 
What a turn on the palate. nothing weird and offputting here any longer. Light peat, vanilla, cherries, and again that caramel malt that you'll find in dark beers. a bit spicy.
the finish is medium long with caramel and honey.

i'll be sure to review it again in a couple of months, once i get used to the nose."
