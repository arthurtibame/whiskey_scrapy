5.0,A deep and complex whisky. Tones of leather and candle wax are prominent in the palate which finishes with a long and intense after burn.

5.0,"Back to the great stuff! :-)

I had a small pour of this one last night at Longman and Eagle, a great whisky bar at Logan Square, Chicago. 

As one could guess from a Bunnahabhain, it has a strong and sweet sherried nose, but not as sweet as the 12 and the 18. There's something ""old"" about it... leather, furniture wax, tobacco, old books, it seems like you're having some oloroso sherry inside an old and fancy library.
It may seem weird but it is great!

The palate arrives way hotter and spicier than the nose and age suggests, but soon you can taste a great caramel sweetness along with cinnamon and roasted nuts.
I think that overall, it works better than the overly sweet 18, the spiciness giving it more balance.

The finish is spicy / sweet with lots of nutmeg and some toffe. It seems to linger forever.

AMAZING!"

4.25,"Very light...on the nose, and on the palate, with very mild notes and a short finish.  Surprisingly smooth, to the point of almost being ephemeral.  Delicious, but almost too ‘light’ for the cost of a bottle, but if money’s no object and you’re looking to introduce someone to whisky (or Islay malts) without shocking them with peat, this would be a delightful one to serve."

4.25,"I'm with the distiller reviewer and @AntonioSchmid on this one in terms of tasting profile. I personally find however whilst very nice it's not a mind blowing experience by any means. It's a pretty well balanced dram albeit heavier on the slightly bitter wood and leather and the aged oloroso sherry coming through well as dark fruits, prunes etc. I really quite enjoyed this, with a couple of drops of water and pared with some food the flavors open up nicely. If not for the bitterness and slight cat pee flavour it may have rated slightly higher than the 4 to 4.25 awarded."

4.25,"Nose - Sweet creamy fruity spice, strawberries & cream candies, fresh thick fruity honey, caramel, toffee

Taste - Fruity ginger tingle/spice, fresh berries & cream, ginger spice, orange zest, light leather sweet/bitter, macadamia/marcona almond nutty sweet, spiced berried honey

Finish - Lingering honey/ginger spice, creamy/buttery mouthfeel, sweet spiced honey, hints of fresh berries, reminds me of what a high quality berried Dambuie might finish like

Score - 91/100

Final Thoughts - I guess I'm a tiny bit disappointed in this one as I was expecting more of an oloroso/px sherry influence to this one. I missed the chocolate/coffee notes I got from the 18. This seemed like it was a higher blend of ex-bourbon with various sherry casks versus sherry cask heavy like the 12 & 18. This one is good for sure, but just lacks that dark chocolate vibe that I think would have made this amazing versus really good. Maybe I just set my expectations too high for this dram? Regardless it has a wonderful creamy, yet spicy mouthfeel that's full of fresh berries and cream mixed with a buttery caramel that's quite wonderful.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes

Would I buy a bottle? - Maybe"

4.5,"What an amazing dram this was. After i couldn't live to the 18yo hype, (it wasn't real for me), this very special distillery blew my mind with this whisky. You can just buy a bottle and drink one dram after a dessert. 

Bottled at 46.3%

On the nose: Dark fruits with chocolates. Prunes very clean. Dulce de leche and baked apples.
Much more delicate and refined. Mostly prunes. That typical burnt hay from bunnahabhain appears. 

On the palate, only two notes, but excelent ones: super vanilla / chocolate and slight citric flavor. 

Aftertaste is also amazing. Oranges with dulce de leche. Sweet with a slight ashiness. Oak spices stay very long in your mouth. A very pleasant dry herbal note. 

Overall this whisky is just amazing. It lost some points on the palate due to its ""straightforwardness"" but it is definitively a wonderful dram. 94 over 100."

4.5,"Brown sugar leather nose becomes a spiced tobacco fig palate explosion that slowly develops through winter spices, dark chocolate, espresso and many more similar flavors throughout a long and complex finish."
