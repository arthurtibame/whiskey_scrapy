3.75,"Combines smoothness of Irish whiskey with nutty flavors from bourbon. There is a very fruit forward essence to the vanilla flavoring. Enjoyable, especially ice cold. 

Good compliment to a mellow cigar"
3.75,smooth and sweet malt because of the cask. Really interesting experience

A second steamship
For the second steamship, we find the aged whiskey in bourbon casks. I still don't understand why we didn't start with this one. Softer, less spicy. More delicate, less full-bodied. Unless I didn't understand something...Still, it'a very good!"
