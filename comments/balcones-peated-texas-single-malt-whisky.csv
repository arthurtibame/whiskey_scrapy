3.25,"Butterscotch, malt must, woody, slight hint of campfire. Serious alcohol burn at first , but then the butterscotch really comes through. Definitely add water. Found that 2 caps of water really made it very enjoyable."

4.5,Sweet malt character. Dried fruits. Thick mouth feel.  Clings to the pallet.  Smokey peat and brisket. BBQ brisket nose with floral and fruity notes. Finish is lingering.  Peat is concentrated in mid pallet. Gently fades.
3.75,This one is different. Not traditional peat like in scotch. Has an herbal/tea spice to it.

5.0,"Belcones Peat Single Malt 

Puts me in a old leather chair reading a old leather Book of Ben-Hur smoking a sweet smooth cigar with the smell of TX BBQ cooking outside. 

Nose: Acid Cigar, TX BBQ, Old Leather Book 

Front: Matches noses with a added toasted cereal note

Back/Finish: Just keeps coming strong with all notes and smell that continues to last and linger on...

Damn good!"
4.0,"All the same quality you would expect from Balcones Single Malt but with a peaty flavor.  But not to worry, it isn't the briney peat flavor but more like from the highlands."
