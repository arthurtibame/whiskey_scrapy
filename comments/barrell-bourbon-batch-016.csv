4.25,"Drank neat.  Butterscotch, floral, slight cinnamon spice.  Super smooth at 52%, little to no burn.  This was a pricey bottle but it makes up for it in the taste and smoothness.  I still think there are $40-50 bourbons on par with this one, but this offering does seem slightly more complete."
4.0,"N:  Mostly buttery, cinnamon, a little bit of brown sugar.
P: same as the nose with cherry at the end.
F:Medium

Solid bourbon from Barrell again."
