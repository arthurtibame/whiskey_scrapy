3.25,(Barrel #1509) After tasting their small batch option I was curious to see how it would taste at cask strength. Not knowing which mash bill this barrel is bums me out a bit. But nonetheless the proof has added a little more flavor and depth to the profile. Very clean and smooth for being 124.2 proof. Get a little of that pot still flavor which is different. Darker fruits like raisins come to mind at the end. Really like it.
