4.0,"Tried at Dan's Bicton tasting. Sweet, spicy, rich and smooth. Me likey. Most of the sweetness and port is in the nice long finish. One and done on this as it's pricey and limited edition, glad to have sampled it though"

3.0,"Nose has the port and fruit. 
Taste is smooth with a little bite and spice in the middle. Sweet. Medium finish. With water it adds intensity to the tip of tongue and palate. 

Tasted at Glen Moray Distillery on 7/22/2016"
3.0,Port on the nose and the finish. Nice spice in the middle of tongue. Pretty sweet and smooth. Water increases the spice at the start.

5.0,Tried this at the whisky extravaganza. Top notch. Sweet and spicy just like its 18 counterpart with a layer of chocolate berries added in the mix.

null,"Review #12 of 12 from DC Whiskyfest 2018. I was only able to do 12 because I came down with something that afternoon that really messed with my head and stomach. I should have just stayed in the hotel room but I didn’t pay $350 for VIP tickets to sample my pillow!
No scores for anything sampled as I don’t think it would be fair.

A sweet and soft nose with light port notes. Malty, honey, blackberries and raspberries. 

A spicy palate, much hotter than expected with pepper and oak, quite dry. 

This was the finale of the night for me. 2 hours into the 4 hour event I had to call it quits and head back up to the hotel room. Each sample I had I asked for half of what everyone else was getting. Most of them I nosed,but only tasted then spit out. I swallowed 5 at most and only the great ones. Still I was glad to get that many with the shape I was in. 
Cheers"
null,"""** Disclaimer: This review is what I would consider a “Quick Hit”- meaning I won’t have my usual in-depth notes that I usually like to take. The reason: this sample was poured at Whiskyfest DC on 4/17/18. All of these reviews will not be scored and I am actively looking to try them again at some point to do them more justice.

This was high on my list for the VIP hour and I’m glad I found my way to this table.  This was a solid pour, even as the rep kept trying to get us to try the 15yo instead.  He reluctantly poured the 25 and we quickly dashed before he got even more pushy.  

They were next to my favorite Irish whiskey- West Cork, and I wanted to try everything they brought, but he was hawking me and made me nervous so I had to bounce.  Missed out on a couple of West Cork because of that creepy dude.  I felt like Rodney Dangerfield when he would nervously pull at the collar of his shirt whenever he got surprised or felt uncomfortable, lol."
