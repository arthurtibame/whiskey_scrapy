4.0,"Irish whiskey tasting, The Oak Barrel, Sydney, 7 Feb 2019. Whisky #4

Nose: Dried fruit, toasted cereal grains, roasted almonds, a little vanilla, leather, and a dark floral sweetness reminiscent of apricot liqueur.

Palate: Full, rich arrival with abounding malty flavours - dark honey, slightly bitter syrup, apple, walnut. There's a firm tannic note from the oak but it's balanced by some vanilla and a dark treacle flavour. The texture is medium-bodied and very agreeable.

Finish: Medium. A pleasant fruity grainy quality with a nutty aftertaste.

The nose is less flowery-floral than some Irish whiskey, with the malted grain providing an earthy depth. It's a complex whiskey that is nonetheless easy to drink, with a nuanced balance between sweet cereal and dry oak notes. It has a resolute and uncompromising profile similar to Balblair.

Very enjoyable neat, and a dash of water brings out further sweetness, if that is your preference, without unbalancing the profile.  The distillate was sourced from Midleton and maturation was in ex-bourbon barrels followed by finishing in Limousin oak casks. An enjoyable and interesting whiskey that is well worth the asking price.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars."

3.75,"Another great M&M dram. Good solid punch of Limousine oak. Think I prefer the pot still and a bit overdone compared to the Dingle (seriously what is it about the dram I'm still thinking about it).

Definitely worth a try."
