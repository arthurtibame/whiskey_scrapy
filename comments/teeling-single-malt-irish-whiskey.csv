3.0,"From my brief notes, Initial nosing reveals banana and a yeast and grain. Soft and sweet on the palate, revealing a fruity body of pears as well as malt. Finishes dry leaving oak and white pepper.  Found this to be better than their Single Grain product. [85/100][Tasted: Whisky on the Hudson 2015]"

Nose of coconut, figs, cocoa, toffee, vanilla, honey, green apples. Almost like a cross between Glengoyne 12 and Jameson

Astringent, spicy, white wine-like on the palate

Finish is herbaceous and short"

4.25,"Nose - Sweet aroma, shortbread biscuit, white wine, red apples and oranges.
Taste - Caramel kettle corn, smooth butter, sweet vanilla, a hint of oak, and mango fruit.
Finish - Mmm.

In college, I was introduced to Irish whiskey with cheap, blended whiskies. They were smooth, but they all had a similar profile (the signature Irish shortbread cookie flavor) with no complexity. Teeling has made Irish whiskey interesting with different wine and rum cask finishes and a higher proof. I have not yet had a Teeling that I did not enjoy and this single malt is a damn good whiskey.

On the nose, I get a very pleasant aroma of white wine and various fruits. Specifically, red apples and oranges come to mind. There is also a faint hint of vanilla bean.

On the palate, this tastes like caramel kettle corn, vanilla, and salty butter.

On the finish, the sweet and savory buttery taste follows to an extremely smooth finish. This is a dangerous whiskey as it drinks much lower than its proof. Every sip is good and you want another."

However on my lips I tasted something, and upon that first pass immediately fell apart into something thin, light, and watery with no character. The finish ended in alcohol, and minimal wood spice. Barely a finish at all. I've been eying this malt for some time now, and I am leaving sorely disappointed ."

4.0,"The nose here couldn't be more Irish if it had a brogue, read Seamus Heaney to me, and called itself my grandfather - classic notes of spice and sweet vanilla, with a little whiff of something floral in the distance. The palate comes as a bit of a surprise - it's rather dry, with nuts, lightly buttered toast topped with dried fruit preserve, jasmine tea, and a little too much burn for a dry malt profile like this. It's fairly obvious that this is still a young whiskey and, for me, could use a little more time in the barrel. It's an intriguingly complex dram, though, and still recommendable!"

A variety of tastes makes this one smell and taste more like Scotch than Irish whiskey. And as long as I am looking forward to some further experiments from Teeling I believe that this one is not quite a classic Irish whiskey. And I will look for the ""spirit of Dublin"" somewhere else."

3.5,"Nose: youthful but not volatile much like a tobermory 10. The sugar and malt nose of horse feed is buried behind a mixture of nectar /honey and thin wine smell.

Taste: the various wines tingle and shine a bright spicy sweetness but there is some flavor confusion and the story is lost. The flavors ring at similar volumes and lengths so nothing stands out too brightly and there’s not quite a narrative here.

The finish is quite nice though where you have a warm hum and the Cookie starts to finally show up. The finish is the best thing about the dram. Overall mouthfeel is medium thin but for the price I’d say this dram pulls is weight. 

Nothing offensive here for newer drinkers."
3.5,"I will need to return to this whiskey as I am a little unsure of the flavours in my initial tasting. I have just tasted the Teeling Single Grain which I thoroughly enjoyed while it was unique from other Irish Whiskeys. The Single Malt is also very unique.

Vibrant nose, spicy and almost smokey. It tastes sweet and dry with a spicy and oak finish. It lingers in the mouth for a little while leaving a sweet/oily but pleasant aftertaste.

3.5,"Nose: Vanilla, raisins, grapes, pineapple, floral malt, chocolate, espresso, cola, saffron, caraway.

Palate: An elegantly sweet arrival - rich and full but not cloying. Chocolate, raisins, sweet coffee, warm baking spices, vanilla, almonds, black cherries, currants, dried guava, dried mango, medjool dates, dried figs. Steamed Christmas pudding in a glass.

Finish: Medium/short. Malty and winey sweetness fading into an oaky sweet aftertaste.

The nose is dense and intricate, but it doesn't unfold over time. It's more one solid slab of complexity (very good complexity, to be sure) than a layering of aromas. The palate is likewise dense and very full, with a rounded and mature profile.

More than anything this whisky reminds me of a PX sherry - Lustau, perhaps. Not particularly in aroma or flavour, but in overall character. There is a sense of age, density and heavy fruit complexity. It's a very ""black"" whisky in its heart, just as Lustau is a ""black"" sherry in fact.

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"

2.75,"Edit: I followed up some high proof bourbon with the guy and I immediately got banana and copper, and that followed me from the nose to the taste. 
Edit: I still don’t love it. There’s a muddled, slightly bitter wine character on a foundation of barley and toffee. It’s nice, but not great. Bumping down to 2.75 from 3.25.
Very easy drinking, glad to have tried it because it was hyped up by some reliable sources. I’ve accepted that Irishes are just not going to be my favorites, but they’re fun to dabble in. The copper nose characteristic of Irishes continues to be off-putting to me, but not repulsive. The body is light, but the flavor is deceptively rich. I get some copper, a good bit of barley, nice toffee notes, and a bunch of lingering red fruit. The finish is my favorite part. Despite being light, the oils of the wine barrels keep it coated on my tongue. Solid for an Irish."

Nose - orchard fruits, wax, touch of oak, some saw dust, a bit of citrus spice, and perhaps a bit of a really earthy high fiber cracker note. 

Taste - Fruit, more apple like notes, some caramel, a bit of sugar cookie, perhaps a bit of a grape fruit or pineapple, and then it transitions into a bit more of a bready malty note.

I wasn't a huge fan when I first opened this. I would guess I got this 2 months ago and it's opened up and become a lot more complex and less just citrus. There's still a youthful oak note here but I'm actually digging how it plays with the sweet malt and citrus elements. I'm going 2.5 stars. Darn good pour for about 60 bucks, not one I'll go back to often but if you like these fruity citrus lighter single malts, this should be a good reasonably priced offering."

3.75,"Very hard to grasp anything specific notes in here on the nose, it's got also much going on that your brain and your nose are trying to figure out what's what.
But overall in general you will get bourbon sugary notes right at your front door, a tiny bit of sherry dry fruit there but not much, light and sweet floral notes, and also only appears once for me on the nose is a rust or ancient smell. Most likely from one of the wine cask. On the base on all this is sort of an American Oak wood spicy notes surrounds all.

On the palate is equal complex with so much going on and with a little time to examine each profile, because you will get hit by same flavour profile very similar to Glenfarclas 105 cask strength but it has additional bit of dry fruit, orange skin.
So sugary, spicy, bitter, tiny tiny bit of sourness to finish the sip.
