4.0,"I really like this whiskey. It has a fairly mellow, but smooth flavor on the nose. The taste is similarly smooth with a great deal of that rye spiciness. The finish is a little thin, but without much bite. A higher-proof bottling of Heaven’s Door rye would be interesting, but this version is very good."
4.5,Notes of spice and a Bouquet of cherries hit my nose at first smell. As I taste the first thing that comes to mind in chocolate cherry brownies. Very smooth and sweet whiskey. Is definitely a unique whiskey thats worth a try.

2.75,Spicy aroma and flavor with some green notes.
4.0,For a Rye it is smooth without much rye burn. There is a tiny hint of the  nail polish alcohol in the pallet but very approachable.

Palate: very spicy, cinnamon, a bit of oak; warming. Finish is long and spicy.
Water: balances the nose and tames the palate.
Overall: perfect for a lover of spicy ryes, with a variety of other interesting flavors."
