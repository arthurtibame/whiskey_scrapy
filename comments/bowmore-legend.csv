4.0,I personally loved it. A lot of taste and character but as with all whisky every bottle is a surprise. It goes well with my cigars I buy (as long as you don't go something too over powering.) It was a decent price when I bought it . I loved it. It's something I use on the regular when I want to really relax or have a good cigar. Will not disappoint.

In fact I'm still not sure what the hell I just tasted, though in complete candor the closest description I can use is: cardboard with the faintest hints of smoke and citrus. This is definitely Bowmore's weakest offering and best skipped over. Cheers!"

3.25,"fairly easy on the nose for an islay. there is the peat, and the sea air, but also Lemon and Orange. 
On the taste there is a pleasant amount of peat, fresh citrus, and after that, a sweetness like a sweet white wine. 
Adding a few drops of water seems to dull the peat a bit, and accenting the sweetness and lemon.
the finish is not long and a bit disappointing. Overall price/money a very nice Islay."
3.5,"Peaty, short body. Good everyday dram."
