4.0,"This is great, not sweet, not fruity, no vanilla, but strong peat and smoke without the usual bandaid accompaniment. I’m a fan"

3.0,"Smoke bomb with thin character and body, poor finish, heavy back palate bite but with little complexity.  Too sweet to have as a mixer, too boring to stand alone."
3.0,"Interesting.  Contrasting with more typical Islays that have strong bouquets and finishes, this feels muted in those areas.  It feels almost invisible until it hits further back I'm the mouth where, interestingly, it explodes into one of the pungent peaty mouthfuls.  I don't sense as much smoke as peat, perhaps the namesake here.  I feel like it hints of almost an olive oil hints in it's quality, both subtly in flavor, and how it reacts to the mouth as it travels through it.  Potential criticism is that this lacks depth of character. It makes an excellent tasting."

2.0,"Leathery and Smokey with a bit of cigar but not much else. If your looking for a burn you’ll find it, but depth doesn’t accompany this scotch. The nose offers false promises as the body doesn’t live up."

2.5,"Meh. I guess if you like peat, she’ll do. (22 Advent19)"
4.5,"Smoke and...apple cider vinegar behind it on the nose? Palate is sweet and salt taffy with a creamy mouth feel that gives away to the smoke. Finish is bonfires and hot dogs with roasted marshmallows. Yummy! I ought to buy more of this! 

Basically a whiskey to go camping with."
3.0,"Oak, smoke and peat with mild spice and some alcohol burn. Smooth in the mouth. Peat isn’t over powering. Please tell overall."
3.25,Cask strength.

3.0,"Simple and without presumption. 

The nose and flavour is obvious: it's in the damn name! Also touches of citrus and metal, with some rubber."
