Doux et délicieux
Il y a des jours, lorsque nous sommes en confinement, que le réconfort se retrouve dans une petite dégustation de fin de soirée afin d'aller au lit et penser à autre chose que ce maudit virus. Ce whisky japonais est d'une douceur fruitée que nous aimons beaucoup!"

2.0,"I opened up my Drinks by the Dram sample I got quite a while back from U.K.  I thought it fitting while watching tonight's Jets game vs Colts.  The burnt ember aroma symbolic of this seasons Jets team.  I'm a huge fan of Yoichi, and still have fond memories of their 20 and 10.  This NAS versions tricks you; the burnt aroma  made me think I'm going to experience the 10 or 20 all over again.  I was WRONG.  Sly little devil tricked me.  The aroma doesn't carry through into the palette.  Really falls apart there.  Weak orchard fruits and citrus.  I'm not getting the same coal  smoke infused flavors as I did in the 10 or 20.  Finish is worse.  Just bitter.   I know there's no replicating 10 or 15 yr olds overnight, and there was no way to forecast the high demand that suddenly showed up for Japanese whiskies, but NAS versions like this truly does it a disservice."
3.0,The nose and entry has all the hallmarks of a Yoichi (I am a huge fan of the Yoichi 15) but then the delivery let's you down and you realize it's not. Such a shame considering nikka no longer makes any yoichi except this. If you see any 15s around grab it.

2.0,"I tried this a while back... And I forgot to review it: well it's soft, vanilla, caramel, the texture is watery, a tiny bit of spice, there is more American oak influence than sherry. The flavours in this one seem to hum quietly with green, early spring fruit, essentially it's a young whisky, one that craves to be mixed with Miyagikyo, it's bolder sibling, to create Nikka Taketsuru. I am sure I am mostly alone in thinking that Miyagikyo and Yoichi alone, as NAS whiskys, are not worth much and I can only bemoan the loss of many aged whiskys from Japan. I recommend Nikka from the Barrel and Nikka Taketsuru over this."
3.75,"I am not a huge fan of NAS whiskies. With few notable exceptions, you are simply paying more to get less. After Nikka discontinued all Single Malts with age statement, I thought this Yoichi would be a big disappointment. Well, I was wrong. Full and fruity with growing hints of smoke, the nose features sour plums, milk chocolate and incense sticks. Rich fruitiness, green tea and a potpourri of sweet, bitter, dry and spicy notes add up to a well-composed palate. The finish falls a bit short and fades rather quickly. Nevertheless, a pleasant surprise. Wabi-sabi!

3.0,"Picture a Lowland distilled in Japan - the nose is weak, with notes of apple juice and almonds (faintly). The palate is sweet and fruity (almost like an orchard), though quite lacking in body and complexity. The finish is a tad short and uninspiring. Overall, I can see myself enjoying this in its proper context: lounging under the sun with a dram and ice on hand."

palate: light and smooth. Gentle fruit and wood at first (peach). Spicier than expected, and is the only one singing in the midpalate. 

Finish: pale woody note at first with the spice coming back for an encore.  a touch of peat and smoke lasts till it fades. 

I enjoyed the nose the most. after reading other reviews, I look forward to tasting the age stated ones, but their prices are just absurd..."

3.5,"After Hakushu, Yoichi, for my money, makes the best single malt whisky in Japan. The distillery itself is a delight, and well worth a visit. Hokkaido in many ways reminds me of Scotland. This particular expression, at least the bottle I picked last week, is decidedly peaty, young but feisty, and compares well to offerings from Wolfburn and Kilchoman. Some of the 15 year old cask strength Yoichis I’ve had rank up there with my favourites of all time. But with age statement Japanese whisky being increasingly hard to find, even here in Japan, I’ll take this till the next time I’m up in Hokkaido and can get to the distillery itself. Don’t pay attention to the naysayers, this is quality distillate, offered by people who really know their stuff."

1.75,"Nose - bananas, vanilla, peat, lemons, and some kinda of pine/alcohol cleaner. It's not overly complex or aged but it's a very nice mix of notes on a younger whisky. Give this one some time in the glass and some of those younger notes will fade and you'll get some nice red fruits, a really nice reward for waiting just 10 minutes or so.

Taste - Smoky and meaty over bright floral and citrus malts. Yoichi brings with it the sweetness of these NAS Nikka's with the complexity of a moderately to actually fairly heavily peated whisky. 

The finish is actually exceptionally long, earthy and vegetable peat.

Coming back to this one a few weeks after I last had it (and I put a nice dent on this one so it's gotten some air) and some of the younger whisky qualities are coming out more. It's not that is is too young, but perhaps too young for the price point. 

I am torn between my appreciation of the complexity and use of peat and these off overly youthful almost new make like notes I'm getting. Ultimately, I have to error on the low end and give this a 1.75. I just can't reward the youth on this one."
