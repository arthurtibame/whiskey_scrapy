4.0,"Nose is full of vanilla and caramel. The palatd find  the above as well as a generous dose of baking spices the finish is slightly long with rye spice lingering. Its important to note that this was directly compared to Blanton's, which shares the same mashbill. I find every aspect of this whiskey to match Blanton's except for depth and finish. For my money its this bottle over Blanton's every day of the week."

3.0,"Rock Hill Farms shares a mash bill with Blanton's, and in some ways must be a close cousin to Blanton's Gold, the overseas exclusive that amps up the ABV.  Compared to the Blanton's lineup, my guess is that Rock Hill Farms reflects a conscious choice to select fruitier or more berry-flavored barrels.  After a nose of vanilla and raisins, the palate features a strong bite of spice and caramel, but with a dominant note of sweet blackberries.  The finish is mild and sweet, fruit-forward like the palate, and doesn't feature the wood or smoke notes that I really love.  This bourbon strikes me as an elevated version of Buffalo Trace, but to be honest I don't think it's worth the price premium.  In the current bourbon mania, this has become a rare bottle, often priced in the triple digits, where I think it represents a poor value.  At around $50, I'd give it four stars."

Taste - Sweet fruity vanilla, milk caramel, hint of orange zest, light oak, hints of fresh strawberry & cherries, light cinnamon heat.

Finish - Lingering vanilla caramels, light oily orange zest, light cinnamon, faint strawberry pop/soda/cola fizz.

Score - 86/100

Final Thoughts - This was quite a tasty one. Not much going for it on the nose, although it was pleasant. Very nice & pleasant from start to finish with no real off-putting notes. Nice balance of vanilla, caramel, & fruity notes that make this quite sippable. The proof doesn't really show as it's quite easy on the palate. This is most likely best neat although I didn't try it with the addition of any water. The fruit present is subtle but quite nice and might be masked with water or ice. The subtle fruit in this might play very nicely in a paper plane as I detect similar fruity notes in Amaro Nonino.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - Maybe, if the price was in the $40-$50 range"

4.0,"This is one I have wanted to try for a very long time but never seem to be able to locate a bottle or pour. I met an old friend of mine in town from Dallas for dinner and saw this one on the bar. The price for the pour was pretty steep considering the cost of the bottle at MSRP ( but like with most hard to find Bourbon's, if you want it you most of the time have to over pay!). After a little bit of thought I decided why not!
For background this is distilled by Buffalo Trace and use the BT #2 Mashbill (same as Blanton's and Elmer T Lee). It's also a Single Barrel and is the highest proof of the bunch (100 proof). On to the tasting:
On the pallette this is really similar to the Elmer T Lee profile but just a bit sweeter. Rich butterscotch, toffee and vanilla. Hint of tobacco precedes a medium to long finish that features maple syrup and oak. The oak takes over here and hints at some good age. This is certainly oakier than both Blanton's and Elmer.  
Have now tasted all of them I would rank them as follows:
1) Elmer T Lee
2) Rock Hill Farms
3) Blanton's
4) Hancock's (by a long way)
I will say, this one is not worth the secondary prices nor is it a $16.50 dram. At MSRP ($60) it's a good buy. 
Cheers All!"

4.0,"Neat in a Glencairn at Jack Rose Saloon in DC.  What a gorgeous bottle. This is a lottery distribution at VA ABC, I did not win, so really pleased to have this at Jack Rose.  Nose is surprisingly bright, with citrus peel, apple, cinnamon. Nice.  Taste is more assertive, yet still subdued somehow, with mild spice and heat over stone fruit, grains, clover. Tons of character and quality here.  I like this a lot.  7/4/19"

4.25,"I like this.  A lot.  That said, it's a little confusing.

Supposedly this comes from the same mash bill as Blanton's and is aged longer than Blanton's (rumored at 8-10 years).  This is a much subtler and balanced bourbon overall and tastes basically nothing like Blanton's.  It's like Blanton's is the devil on your shoulder and this is the angel.  Where Blanton's hits hard with specific flavors this one sort of quietly introduces itself and gets more interesting as time goes on.

Nose: Musty wood up front, slight leather, baking spices, and wild flowers.  A very muted nose.  I kept swirling and waiting for the nose to open up but it just didn't come through.  This is the number one reason for the 4.25 rating instead of a 4.5 or 4.75.

Taste: Light vanilla, some oak though not overwhelming, heavy poached pear and poached apple, baking spices.  I can't tell if this whiskey is super subtle or if everything is just dialed up to 11 and is super balanced.  Either way it's subtle and excellent.  One thing that surprised me is that this isn't as coating and oily as I expected or wanted it to be given how many folks compare this to Blanton's which I find very coating.

Finish: Some rye spice, light dried fruit, subtle vanilla cream.  This is a long finish that changes as time goes on but with very subtle flavors.  Definitely a sipper and it doesn't punch at it's weight (100 proof) and is super smooth.

Overall I really enjoyed how much the flavors were in balance but wished some things would come through more especially on the nose.  If this were a less expensive bottle and more readily available I could see this becoming a regular for me.  I'm looking forward to doing a side by side comparison with Blanton's in the future."

4.25,"Smokey at initial nosing with a follow of complex spice and finishing in sweet vanilla. 
First taste brings  bite of tobacco and spice up front and lingers off to a creamy Carmel and vanilla. The finish is a strong hit of spice and rye. 
If more available, this is my go to pour."

4.5,"Nose: Strong berry and dark fruit notes lead off the front, and light notes of cinnamon and caramel blend underneath. Overall, the nose is rather light and well balanced.

Palate: The front of the palate leads off with citrus, apple, and berry notes. In the middle, the berry notes blend with light cinnamon, cocoa, and light herbal notes. The finish brings a touch of spicy notes: cinnamon and pepper, mixed with dry oak notes and light notes of brown sugar and vanilla."

4.0,Tried at hundred north in gilbert. 100 proof good stuff. Need to track down a bottle.
4.5,"Neat.  Similarities to Blanton’s are evident on the nose but the flavors feel more distinct and easy to pick.  Dusty oak, butterscotch, vanilla, baking spice, raisins.  A back and forth of high notes and low notes.  Very vibrant.

Nice creamy mouth feel.  Very dark on the tongue.  Brown sugar and maple.  On the taste, hits with a sudden and quick uppercut of mint and vanilla. Transitions to caramel and butterscotch.  Ends with the baking spices and vanilla.  Sticks around for awhile.

Quite yummy!"
4.25,The nose opens with slight oak and a hint of mint followed by caramel on second smell. brown sugar and oak on the tongue with a nice long finish that fades to an almost Madeira finish. Mellow sweet apple and baking spices finish this dram.
4.75,"Leather, spices, light berries, caramel. Very complex! Sipping neat, it finishes stronger than 100 proof. Probably one of the best I’ve had in A LONG TIME!"
4.5,"Extremely smooth, vanilla and caramel finish"
4.0,"Nose- salted caramel, dark fruits, raspberries , dusty oak, and cinnamon 

Palate- raspberries, salted caramel, oak, dark chocolate, light cocoa

Finish- long, oily finish with notes of caramel and cocoa powder

A very balanced bourbon, and moderately complex. Has a long, tasty finish. I can’t help but to be disappointed with this one due to the hype. Still an above average bourbon though. At $50-60 for msrp I wouldn’t pass up buying this- but 150 for it is a little much"

4.5,"This one as beef very tricky to find, but my time came. Excited to see how this higher proof Buffalo Trace mashbill #2 bottle is.

The nose is almost equal parts fruit and spice at first. But the more you nose it, the spicier it gets. I pick up cooked apples l, raisins, berries, a lot of baking spices, freshly baked bread, oak, leather and musty old barn.

The palate has an oily mouthfeel and slightly sweet. There are a ton of spices that come through (baking spices, rye), oak, vanilla, and a little bit of leather.  It dries the mouth just a tad, not anywhere near as much as some high proofs do.

The finish is nice and long with a continuation from the palate. Tons of baking spices and a little rye as the burn slowly goes down your throat into your chest. 

This is a fantastic bourbon. Great nose and complex palate with a very pleasant long finish. This is probably my favorite of Buffalo Trace’s mashbill #2, but I need to to a side-by-side between the rest to be sure."
4.75,Very smooth!
4.75,"The nose is berries and creme, maybe some butterscotch.  Very well balanced.  Palate follows with the berries and oak, with a spicy and floral finish.  Cinnamon notes.  The complexity and finish of this bourbon are top notch.  By far, the king of Buffalo Trace's mashbill #2 in my opinion."

4.0,Pretty good prefer Blantons from MB2
3.5,"Stronger nose than ETL and ER. The BT line starts blending together after time, but I can tell this is higher proof. Caramel and vanilla too. 

Cinnamon hits palate. Cherry shows up. Approachable familiar BT product. More complex than ER on the palate. Hotter and tastier. Would be good at retail but good luck with that. I think this is on par with OWA. 

I use the rating scale below. Distiller uses a scale of 5 and I use a scale of 10, but I’m sure you’re not too drunk to do the math! 

1. Disgusting - So bad I poured it out.
2. Poor - I wouldn't consume by choice.
3. Bad - Multiple flaws.
4. Below average - Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.
5. Good - Just average.
6. Very Good - Better than average.
7. Great - Well above average.
8. Excellent - In a league of its own.
9. Incredible - An all-time favorite.
10. Perfect"
