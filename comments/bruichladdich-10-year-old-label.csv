4.0,"I was in a whisky tasting last night when the host said ""ok lets open something a little old"" and he took out this Bruichladdich 10yo, old presentation, maybe from 2003, with the metal case and the old label. I don't have the best impression from this distillery, because ""the classic laddie"" was awful, and then i had the port charlotte and that was good, and then i had the Black Art and it was awesome. So this coul be the final vote to determine a general veredict. Lets see how that went.

This actually had 46%abv. Pale straw color.  (The cork broke. Not unexpected at all).

On the nose: Orange right away. Lemon. Coffee; Acetone, Butter and Cloth softerner. 

On the palate, it is a little strange. Ginger, Soap (typical from Bruichladdich), fresh Oranges. A little watery.

Aftertaste is the best part of this dram. Peat, Pepper, Tobacco. Orange infused peat. Eucaliptus.Toffee. Really nice stuff.

Overall this is a very unbalanced dram. Good/regular on the nose; weird on the palate and a great aftertaste. There is a fine line between Interesting and akward and this one is hard to tell on which side it is. 83 over 100."
3.75,"Bruichladdich 10, Islay, 89 pts. If it’s lightly peated, I can’t taste it.  The flavour is subtle. Light body with a honey sweetness and light ginger spice. Dry finish."
