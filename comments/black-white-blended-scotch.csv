0.75,"Nose: Burnt rubber, superior alcohol and some sweetness. Some red fruits but almost totally covered by the burnt  rubber and alcohol. 

Mouth: Sweetness, superior alcohol nothing more to add. 

Overall impression: a whisky produced to be used in mixed drinks or drank with ice (not recommended). Even to beginners this dram can be impacting, due to its unbalanced taste and aroma. I do not recommend if you’re searching for something really pleasant."

2.5,"I got a 1.75L of this for a Christmas present from one of my student's parents. They must know us teachers pretty well. ;) Just what I needed to make mixed drinks over the holidays and not waste the good sipping stuff for me. :) Back when I was drinking Rob Roys every night this would have been okay, but it certainly isn't a great sipping scotch. Pretty much like all the lower-shelf scotch. I think for half the price I'd stick with the Highland's Mist. You can't really tell the difference once you add sweet and dry vermouth and bitters."

3.25,"Average Whisky, On the nose you get the normal tones: vanilla, cream, chocolate but also a very mild smoke and maybe orange. On the palate is less atractive, very simple. Starts with a sweet caramel sensation to change into a hot and spicy note but not very strong. It is not a complex taste, there is oak present and the finish is short. I believe is a good dram for a very low price"

3.5,"Whilst not unusual to have a whiskey distillery with a 130+ history its a lot less common to have a whiskey itself have the same longevity. Well officially its name wasn't Black and White until 1902 but it was known as such long before that. It initially incorporated Dalwhinnie, Clynelish and Glendullan malts but not to sure what the mixture is now. They still sell over 1 million cases these days. Many moons ago it seems (well actually last month) at NZ Dramfest I was lucky my friend mentioned a free talk on rare whiskeys. I had sadly missed out on purchasing the paid session (and  my chance to taste a Brora dammit!) but I took what I thought was a break from drinking whiskey to listen to some talking from Dave Broom, Charles MacLean and the founder of the festival. To my surprise they also allowed us a sample of a 30 year old 30% example of this drop. One of my most interesting whiskey experiences, completely different from today's style or even singe malts of similar age. One word Molasses! Hard to judge it as its a unique beast but I'll say 3.5."

2.75,"Nose: Cereal and a little sherry, citrus notes, malt, freshly baked bread. Not a particularly characterful nose but there's no ethanol taint and there is a tiny whiff of smoke. It's vaguely reminiscent of the Johnnie Walker blend character, but better - pleasantly crisp and light. [There is a greater smoky note on the dry-glass].

Palate: Wow! Totally unexpected! A full and creamy arrival with great balance. Sweet and fruity at first but then as it hits the palate a generous helping of well-articulated smoke rolls in ahead of a mouth-filling malt surge. It doesn't last for long but it makes a stunning impression while it does. The texture is silken and soft, and there is a mildly spicy character that lasts right until the end.

Finish: Medium. Malty, spicy and sweet with a trailing aftertaste. There is a crisp, light cereal graininess in the finale that is quite elegant and it avoids any metallic stain.

This is the first time I've ever tasted Black & White and I get why it is a firm favourite for some folks, but I can also see why others would hate it. It is a show-pony for grain whisky - very GOOD grain whisky with excellent flavour and texture - while the malt content is there purely to provide a dramatic and precisely defined malt, fruit and smoke counterpoint. It's an unusual way to create a blend.

It has great simplicity and clarity of profile and that's kind of the downside as well. If you are not partial to light and breezy blends with a silky texture then this will seem either devoid of flavour or too much centered on ""sweet but bland"" grain whisky. If you crave a blend where the malt whisky content dominates the grain whisky then you'll not like this so much.

It works stonkingly well either as a neat tipple (in which case it is way too easy to drink!) or with soda water where the character is in no way diminished by dilution. In fact I'd go so far as to say that this is one of the best lower-mid shelf blends I've tasted in a simple highball.

The biggest thing going against it is the price, which puts it into direct competition with Johnnie Walker Black Label, Ballantine's 12, Dewer's 12 and any number of other good middle-shelf blends. In that company it gets a little lost, which is a shame as this is a pretty good dram. If it was cheaper I'd buy it again.

I do think that the official score of 74 is pointlessly mean - this is easily comparable to blends that have been rated much more highly here and IMHO it's worth more like 80 at least.

Oh, and one more thought - if you are a big fan of Compass Box Hedonism blended grain whisky then try a dram of that followed immediately by a neat taste of this. You will get the picture instantly, and Black & White may just be revealed as your favourite blended scotch.

""Average"" : 2.75 stars"

3.0,"Riddle me this: who sips a NAS Blended Scotch nowadays? Of course it's better suited as a Highball! The youth of both the Grain Whisky and the Malt, the light taste and texture are part of a whisky that simply begs to be used as a summer mixer. And you could drop a shot in your tea come Wintertime."
