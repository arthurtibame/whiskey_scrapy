4.25,Last whisky from a Glenmorangie tasting and my third favourite! Was already too drunk for more precise tasting notes but really lovely stuff. Have to try it again when I’m sober... \o/

3.0,"On the nose, I get honey, dark spices, brown sugar, and lemon. Floral properties showed themselves after some more oxidation. For the palate, I get Fig Newtons, subtle molasses, hazelnuts, and milk chocolate.  For travel retail only, and 80 bucks, this is definitely one to pick up and be patient with drinking. The finish is toffee sweet, a little short, but not too dry. I get the feeling that this is the Quinta Ruban Lite of Glenmorangie. 3.5 to me. The theme of this dram should be light and sweet as well like a power ballad. ""Heaven"" by Warrant should suffice. Thanks Paul for the great TRE sample!"

4.0,"Another travel retail exclusive I picked up at the Windsor-Detroit tunnel duty free shop. I supplied this as a bonus for our tour group and I’ve been working my way through the remainder of the bottle. Named after St. Duthac who was supposedly born around 1000 A.D. and the Patron Saint of Tain, Ross-shire where the Glenmorangie distillery is located. This NAS expression (which I believe to be 8-12 years old), is finished in a combination of PX sherry and charred virgin oak casks. Bottled at 43% ABV, chill filtered with colorant added. A very nice dark copper color. 

The nose starts with sweet fruity sherry. Apricots, figs and pears. Sweet brown sugar and toffee. Lots of roasted nuts, a mix of walnuts, Brazil nuts and perhaps pecans. Vanilla and fresh oak. More fruits come back around with plums and raisins. A combination of dark and milk chocolate, light cinnamon and buttercream. A touch earthy/vegetal, maybe showing a little peat influence. Marzipan with a faint mint and a hint of cola. The bottom of the glass reveals a light syrupy goodness. 

The palate is sweet initially but carries some spice with it. Apricots, peaches, vanilla and milk chocolate. Brazil nuts and almonds. Strong fresh cut oak. Raisins, sherry and sweet cherries and cherry candies. A dessert dram for sure, but with enough spice to keep it from being cloyingly sweet. 

Medium bodied mouthfeel, a bit thin but slightly waxy. Mouthwatering then dry. 
A medium long finish that is sweet, slightly spicy with oak and apricots. 

Glenmorangie is such a clean spirit that it takes to finishing very well. The cask influence is strong and both the PX and virgin oak are clear and easily detectable. Not quite as good as the Quinta Ruban but as good as the Lasanta in my opinion. I’m glad I bought this one because it’s worth trying, but I doubt I would buy it again, mostly because I’m only allowed a couple bottles at a time when crossing the border and there are more I need to try. Not a bad value at $80 for a full liter. A solid 4. 
Cheers 🥃"
3.0,"A hectic but a merry and wonderful Christmas Eve and day with family and friends that make this time of year special. Now sitting by the fire listening to some Vince Guaraldi Trio (you know the Christmas soundtrack) during this frigid evening to relax with the TRE provided by @Generously_Paul

A rich sherry nose with toffee, cocoa, tea. Very fruity with plumbs, raisins and a faint strawberry aroma deep in the back and after given some time to open. 

Brown sugar and toffee sweet arrival.   There is spice as well: cinnamon, white pepper. The sweetness slowly moves into spicy cloves that fades towards the finish. 

A black peppery finish with some nuttiness with a slight orange bitterness.  A nice medium length finish. 

I have never been a huge fan of Glenmorangie.  The general profile, for me, does not excite me (maybe what I would classify as mass-market safe). However, this Duthac was enjoyable. A sweet dessert whisky that’s pleasant.  One of the better Glenmorangie’s. [86/100][Tasted: 12/26/17]"
4.0,"I'm not a huge fan of Glenmorangie NAS, but I kind of liked this one.  A big bold dessert dram, but not overly sweet like their Milsean.  Rather nuttier with strong hazelnut flavor.   Not sure I'd go out of my way to buy this, but I sure am thankful to have tried it, especially being a TRE ( thanks to Paul as part of our trading team in providing the sample)."

3.0,"Here’s another travel retail exclusive malt that I probably would’ve never had the chance to try if it weren’t for my friend Paul.  I’m not exactly a Glenmorangie fan to begin with, so chances are I wouldn’t buy this one even if it was available locally.  So, a big thanks again to Paul.

This one immediately reminds me of the La Santa core bottle:  lots of sherry and chocolate notes from the start.  This is from the newly minted Legends Collection- which is just as you guessed- a NAS “series” with at least two more bottles to come.  This one is primarily Pedro Ximenez and virgin oak cask and comes in at 43% ABV with coloring added and chill filtration.  It’s a pretty golden, amber in the glass and makes oily, long legs when you spin it.

The nose is heavy raisins, breakfast syrup, cocoa powder and roasted nuts.  There’s a slight, lingering bit of alcohol heat there, too.  The palate is brown sugar and toffee that’s rounded out well by wood oak spice and a bite of ginger.  The finish is medium-short and pretty sugary, as well.  There’s some lingering cinnamon and oak that help clean up after all the sweetness.

Overall, I don’t think I like it as much as I initially enjoyed the La Santa bottling.  This one seems a lot sweeter and not as well-rounded with regards to mouthfeel.  It’s enjoyable, no doubt, I just think this is a tweaked version of the La Santa that’s been renamed and allocated to travel retail.  Which, generally speaking, is BS.  But maybe that’s just me being bitter that I don’t have easy access to TRE stuff.  It’s a solid 3.5-3.75 stars, though.  Cheers"

2.75,"Nose- That signature overripe pit fruit fragrance mingled with honey notes. Less cloying then Lasanta.  
Body- Less sweet than the nose would have you believe but still quite sweet. The sweet dark fruit flavor is balanced fairly well with nutty and dark chocolate notes. It reminds me of a fruit and nut bar. I just wish it had a bit less maltiness.
Finish- The dark chocolate notes continue through in the finish. 

Not bad, but I still don’t think I am a Glenmorangie guy."
3.5,"Out of the 15 drams we had on the night this was definitely in the bottom quarter. A bit harsh, usual vanilla,  bit of citrus and nothing special. 3.5"

4.0,"Man oh man are your senses in for a treat if you get to try this! Start to finish this was a delicious and satisfying whisky, especially if you have a weakness for PX. The moment you open that bottle, hints of coffee, oranges and raisins greet your nose - you KNOW it's a sherry finish. The palate is a continuation of the nose, fruity, and it's here that you encounter this spirit's only pitfall: it's flat and weak (a little more alcohol here would have gone a long way). The finish is complex and long, with different spices working in tandem for minutes on end. Great stuff!"

4.0,"Tbh, I don’t remember much about the Duthac apart from really enjoying it and catching the classic Glenmorangie warm honey sweetness vibes.
The nose is full of vanilla, nougat and caramel. Some wood as well. A bit of chocolate and nuts.
Again even more sweet to the palate. Vanilla, toffee, nougat, apricots, butterscotch and milk chocolate.
Maybe even not that young though it is a NAS release.
Aftertaste is sweet as well ultimately exposing its Glenmorangie core.
In overall it may lose on points towards the Quinta Ruban but still it’s a good example of what travel retail whisky should be like."

4.25,"It’s bold and full. You can tell it’s sherried but the virgin oak adds some girth to it. I love the complexity in this guy. The nose has some fruit and orange, along with a little copper. The palate is the perfect balance of fruit and oak. A little chocolate too. It’s a complex scotch that I’d like to have in my cabinet."

4.5,"A delicious dram of this great distillery; part of the legends expression from Glenmorangie. Matured part in Pedro Ximenez Casks and part in Virgin oak casks.

Bottled at 43% abv, amber color.

On the nose is fair. Liquorice, Blackberry, Ashes, Dr. Pepper cola, Slight vanilla, and a Herbal note like boiled asparagus.

On the palate is very good, Orange syrup, Tobacco, Oranges, soft and Pleasant, some Smoke and Chocolate. 

Finish is long, sweet. Overall i give this dram a 93 over 100. For 80$ is a good deal."
