3.0,"Tamdhu 15 year  - is it just batch 3 CS at non CS? 

Nose - Berries, earthy oaky wine funk, vanilla, a get a hint of spice (cinnamon perhaps or maybe something else), maybe some ginger, hints of dry milk chocolate.

Taste - sherry bomb for sure, but there's a good bit of oak character here, almost too much. It gets sweeter as it opens up, more vanilla, a bit of toffee, chocolate, and still more oak. 

Finish - dry sherry, oak, and some chocolate. 

I did this one a while back side by side with the batch 3 and it was shocking how similar the sherry notes were. This is a bit thinner (not cask strength) and there's a bit more oak here. I don't however feel the finish is longer or really that the age did more for this one. A part of me feels that those cask strengths are actually pretty old whisky or at least have a good bit of older whisky as it's really surprising how similar they are.

Really good whisky but it's a bit bitter/oaky for only 15 years and not as creamy as the cask strength. That said still very good and one that I'll strongly consider getting more of if I can't replace the cask strength options."
