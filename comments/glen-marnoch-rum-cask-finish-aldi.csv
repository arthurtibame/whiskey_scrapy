0.5,Strong rum flavour with nothing to redeem it
3.0,null
1.5,"Nose: Apple juice, cider vinegar, cereal, green hay, a little vanilla. It's spirity and sharp and there's no rum to speak of. [The dry glass has no aroma at all].

Palate: A spicy/sweet arrival that turns quite hot as it develops - chili and white pepper rather than ginger as with the stablemate whiskies in this release. The texture is pretty watery and the palate is very fast - blink and you'll miss it.

Finish: Medium/short. A little licorice and a hint of mint. The aftertaste lingers but mainly as a sweetish neutral alcohol flavour.

This is the third miniature in the 3-pack of budget Glen Marnoch whiskies I bought today (see the Bourbon Cask Finish and Sherry Cask Finish for the others). I thought this was by far the least impressive of the set.  The other two are basic, acceptable young malts suitable for mixing and just good enough to sip. This one tastes rougher, harder and much thinner and I'd only have it in a long drink with cola and ice.  It's not that expensive, but there are better options at this price.

So, who makes this Glen Marnoch stuff?  It's difficult to say but if I had to make a guess it would be Glenmorangie. There's something about the nose in particular that is very reminiscent of their house character.

These are very young malts, only slightly over 3 years old, and they all have the same simple profile - mildly fruity and cereal with a touch of spice. The distillate is still clearly in charge but with a thin veneer of bourbon, sherry or rum on top (and in the case of the rum expression it is micro-thin).  The sherry cask finish is my pick of the bunch.

""Adequate"" : 1.5 stars."
