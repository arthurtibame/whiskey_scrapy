4.25,"From the beautiful box to a fairly good whisky, this Macallan Concept No. 1 is one enjoyable dram, nothing to die for but i got to say as a non-macallan fan that i would buy this one again. 

The box where the bottle comes is like a work of art. A lot of surreal images that have a whisky theme, like art from Salvador Dalí. The whole concept thing is about the art of making whisky. 

Let's talk about the whisky.

Bottled at 40%abv, tawny color

On the nose: pretty complex but nothing special. Toffee, Old Orange peel, Wet grass, thick Dulce de leche, Sawdust.

I get the citrus that they talk on the box. It has a very noticeable orange profile. Freshly cut orange. The sawdust is powerful. It is not as ""macallanish"" as other macallans, and what i mean with this is that every Macallan has more than less the same aroma.
It has released a lemon profile after five mins.

On the palate, the first sip is a little dim,  citric like lemon. Herbal, Ginger, Oaky with Some toffee sweetness. Easy drinkable but in debt with the people. Way too simple. 

Aftertaste is nice. Toffee, Oak spice, Sawdust. Very woody. Long mouth numbing finish. 
Not your typical Macallan, doesn't feel like it. 

Overall, i kinda like what they tried here, that was ""something different"" hahaha. For me, Macallan is way too static in a comfort zone and they are releasing lots of new expressions that are ""just ok"". This one is no different in that sense, but at least offers a little off the charts for that distillery. 84 over 100. Buyable."
