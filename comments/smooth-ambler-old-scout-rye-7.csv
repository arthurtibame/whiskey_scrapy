5.0,"My absolute favorite right now.  The nose is like an old library.  Old wood and sweet leather.  On the tongue, the same, with a little brown sugar.  The finish has a dill note.  Not dill pickle, but herbal dill.  It doesn't sound good, but it is amazing!"

4.0,"4 stars - Smooth and spicy, almost peppery, but still plenty of sweetness.  The finish is full on rye bread, and a little bit of fruitiness. Very little burn and a little dry."

3.0,"Blind tasting sample from Aaron Stark. 

Nose: pencils and graphite open up to vanilla and new oak. Furniture polish opens up to caramel corn
Palate: horseradish at first quickly diffused to light caramel, cream, corn, and then spearmint. Medium silky texture. Not much heat to the mid-palate. Sweet. 
Finish:
Warmth escalates then quickly fades, leaving a bitter and dry burnt sugar sensation atop a light syrup coating. Pink peppercorn."
3.0,"Deep rich nose, a bit of Cola. Tastes of cola as well, floral notes with a bit of bitterness. Spice is mild but hits at the back of the throat. Pleasant. 10/16/17"
