5.0,"Such a beautiful and smooth whiskey, first tasted at the Whiskey Museum in Edinburgh, and I had to get my hands on a bottle. Definitely one to savour, with a sweet aroma and a wonderful velvet-like finish that lasts for a long time. #1 in my Top Shelf without a doubt. It resides well out of sight in the back of the cupboard under the stairs, and only shared with my father and my father-in-law...and even then it has to be their birthdays to warrant a snifter! Even my wife doesn't get to drink this. My bottle is aged 13 years."
