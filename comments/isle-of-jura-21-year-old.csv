4.0,"Right after being poured, this whisky is hot and peppery.  Let it sit for five minutes and you're in for a treat.  The sherriness is mild, it's nutty, fruity, slightly oily.  Smooth and well balanced."

4.0,"An interesting, and notably more complex Jura than any of its younger siblings. The most delicious part of this dram is how the salty notes lift the entire palate -- it's a saltiness in the very best way. Agreed with the surprisingly short finish noted by Mr. Le Daoré."

3.0,Musty jam tarts. Sherry. Pepper and more sherry. Goes down smooth and full of flavours but I would never have more than one a night.
2.25,"It's an interesting drop this one. Its got a few great components but there is an underlying bitterness you get often with older whiskies. I remember the talisker 25 having a similar issue. Some note a wet, musty nose which I picked up as well. I thought it maybe brine or salt and maybe its that as well but by the end of the dram it builds and becomes almost grapefruit rind like. The other components get overpowered and so 2.25 I give this one...my least favorite Juras yet."

3.0,"I felt like a senior citizen yelling at a millennial “damn it, young man, act your age!”.    I expected more out of a 21 yr old.  I’ve always felt that Jura lacks a focus and house style, which then makes its products all over the place.  This was quite apparent in this 21 yr old.  I went in expecting austere elegance, refinement, and classs...all enveloped around a powerful Islander style oceanic brine and sea salt.  What I got was a smorgasbord of flavors, ranging from chocolate to fruits to oak.  At the age of 21, resting in warehouses near craggy ocean beaten shorelines, I’d expect that influence to permeate into the whisky.  Basic law of osmosis.  So the let down, for me at least, wasn’t that it’s not good,..it’s a decent enough whisky.  But I’m not getting the influence I’d expect in a 21 yr old Islander."

4.0,"Nose - Dark chocolate, toffee, Snack Pack chocolate pudding cups, oak.

Taste - Cinnamon spice infused raisins & plums, white pepper heat, dark chocolate, oak, tootsie rolls, chocolate pudding.

Finish - Ling lingering white pepper spice heat, more chocolate pudding that fades to a dark chocolate covered raisin sweet, lingering cinnamon spice.

Score - 85/100

Final Thoughts - This definitely tasted like an older Scotch in that it had that deep, brooding, wet, aged, soaked oak smell and taste to it. It smelled dark, had a tiny hint of dark stone fruits on the nose, but otherwise seemed to be dominated by this chocolate pudding cup & cocoa powder vibe throughout. There seemed to have been at least a tiny portion of sherried Scotch in there, but it was mostly dominated by the chocolaty nature. Nothing really offensive, but the cheap chocolate pudding cup vibe kinda killed it for me.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

5.0,"Spoiler alert: This is nothing like the Jura 16. More spoiler alert: Distiller's 88 is a disgrace. Sultana raisins, prunes and vanilla hits your nose with everything you can expect and desire from a sherry influenced whisky. The palate has an added element of sweet almond paste that really bring all the aromas together (as a side note, if you're not from the UK, using words like marzipan rather than almond paste or cream is just laughable). The finish is incredibly complex with a difficult to pinpoint aroma that truthfully reminds me of marijuana (you know what I'm talking about). This is truly pleasing."

4.5,"Beautiful dram, i dont think it is too expensive and it is full of flavor. I am a fond fan of most Jura's Whiskies, but this is a good expression that deserves credit. 

Bottled at 44%abv 

On the nose is mostly sweet even for a mildly peated whisky. Heathery peat, Super sweet. Orange zest. Orange candy. Hints of coffee; Coffee intensifies after first sip.

On the palate it is much more peaty. Tobacco. Cigarrettes, ginger spice, there is some citric fruits also. Second sip was much more earthy. 

The best part is the aftertaste. Smoky cigarrette finish. Wow this is super interesting, Its like nicotine. Earthy mud aftertaste. Impressive finish really, so earthy, almost dirt but in a pleasant way. Very long lasting.

Overall this dram deserves a solid 89 over 100, i dont think it is an everyday dram but it is surely going to surprise you. I had it for a second time, found a lot of prunes and sherriness."
5.0,"Easy start strong finish minimal nose just subtle vanilla with a beautiful ripening fruit bouquet as it runs down the throat. Silky smooth mouth feel caramels, molasses  and a finish of smoke"
