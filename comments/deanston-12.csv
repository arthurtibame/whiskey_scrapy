4.0,I bought a bottle during a visit to the distillery (which I would highly recommend if you ever find yourself in the area) and I really am impressed. It is not your average scotch considering there is no peat involved in the malting process and it has a sort of sour note on the nose due to an extended fermentation process. All of this owes to a very unique whisky with plenty of character.

3.0,"The distillery takes a lot of pride into making this whisky as it does. ""Nothing added but hard work and determination"", ""simple, handcrafted, natural"", etc. Whisky puritans will surely appreciate this love for authenticity. However, the whisky itself falls a bit short: the sweet and fruity notes are too subtle, and the result is a whisky that is good, but doesn't stand out from other light, sweet whiskies. Regardless of whether that is despite its natural production or because of it, it's a real shame."

3.0,"Yeah... This one's tough to review only because I almost drowned in my tumbler from the boredom of this whisky. You would think something with 46% ABV would hold up with some body and flavour, but that's really not the case here. It's barely medium-bodied, the finish is relatively short (though spicy), and the nose lacks depth. That's not to say there's nothing enjoyable here: the citrus notes, faint apples and spices are evocative of apple pie (and who doesn't love apple pie!). It isn't bad at all, though such timid endorsements are never a good thing."

3.0,"I found this mini while organising my whiskey cabinet and had forgotten I bought it a few months back. Upon initial perusal of the distiller review, I’m not quite sure why this one got such a low rating. Sure, it’s not going to change anybody’s world view or be the most magnificent scotch ever consumed, but it’s a solid dram. The kind that if I were at someone’s house and they offered it to me I wouldn’t hesitate to say yes. 

The nose is a bit harsh, yes, with all those ethanol bits jumping out at you initially. Muscling past that gives you some warm barley notes reminiscent of a freshly mown lawn. The taste makes up for the nose. Lots of creamy barley notes that coat your mouth and last a while. This whisky is a frequent flyer in a lot of Compass Box blends and it can tell that by sampling the single malt in isolation. Finish is surprisingly long. 

Is it amazing? No, but hardly worth a 79. A solid pour on any day, and an integral part of some of my favorite blends. Cheers!"
3.75,"Nose:
Light malt syrup 
Talcum powder
Soft and clean 
Fresh linen or lanolin 
Vanilla bright and metallic

Arrival 
Gentle but it grows to the development 
Pretty herbal sweet
Hot sugar syrup 
Citric acid
Red corral lettuce bitter
Vanilla bean

Development 
white tea
Bush lollies (sweet aphid sugar left on eucalyptus leaves) 
Stevia
Fresh Basil and anise 

Finish
Lovely finish, clean and refreshing
Strong clingy parsley root
Sweet herbs like mint and stevia

I really enjoy this one. There’s nothing unpleasant or abrasive. The only downside is that I want more out of that arrival (water isn’t revealing more). Perhaps a higher proof would help but the proof is already 46.3%... I want 50+ haha I would pay extra."

Poured neat, thick sticky glasscoat. Nose is cinnamon apple, buttered corn muffins, honey and heavy malt. No smoke or peat just pure scotch. Creamy mouthfeel leads to palate of dense honey malt, melted butter, more apple and cinnamon stick with some balancing oak. Finish is drying wood with mild char and fading buttery malt. Not complex but flavors are deep and rich with sit on your tongue smoothness of a 15-18 yr vintage. I can see why this won so many medals. Its near perfect execution of an unpeated straight forward malt............96/100..........absolutely delicious, definite repurchase......To me this is what you should see if you look up pure scotch whisky in a virtual dictionary, the rest are variants with fruit, peat , etc...... On the box its says "" a gift from the gods"" I concur, This is buttery malt bliss!!"

3.75,"Olfato: doce, frutado (talvez maçãs), aroma leve e fresco, malte, gramíneas, amendoado, baunilha, floral e um leve apimentado. Aroma muito suave e com boa complexidade.

Paladar: dulçor de frutas frescas, apimentado de gengibre, leve amargor contrastando muito bem com algumas notas ácidas, todas elas muito bem inseridas e balanceadas. Amendoado, um pouco amadeirado e oleoso. 

Finalização: media para longa apesar de suave. As notas apimentadas - do tipo gengibre- permanecem por mais tempo na boca, seguidas de um dulçor e amendoado bem presentes. 

Impressões gerais: whisky não turfado, frutado, de personalidade forte e bem definida. Sem filtragem gelada e sem corantes artificiais, o que eleva o nível da experiência durante a degustação. Sua graduação alcoólica elevada (46,3% ABV) não se esconde em nenhum momento, porém é muito bem inserido e presente apenas em uma terceira ou quarta camada. Ótimo custo benefício, sendo que seu preço é muito menor - mesmo sendo um single malt - do que os blended malts conhecidos do público brasileiro e tidos como ótimos whiskies. Destilaria ainda bem desconhecida do público brasileiro, mas que merece toda nossa atenção já que que seus whiskies são ótimos e muito bem produzidos."

2.5,"Nose is elusive and hard to pin down, but the mouth flavors are far from shy: they’re rich and flinty. I like such mineral qualities in a white wine, but they don’t quite work here. It’s too dry and austere and ultimately not very memorable."

The palate is thick and creamy. Not complex but very strong flavors. Sweet fruits in the background like raisins and apples. 

Finishes with a slight burn on the tongue and a heavy malt flavor. 

I’ve had this bottle for a few years, and every time I try it, I like it more. Maybe the whiskey has grown on me or maybe my tastes have grown to appreciate it. I normally enjoy some smoke and peat in my scotch, which makes it more impressive how delicious this scotch is with no signs of smoke or peat."

3.0,"Solid average daily scotch. Noses fairly strong alcohol with oak and some vanilla. Getting oak, vanilla, and tea? on the palate. Like the cheap black tea you make in bulk and drink gallons of in the summer... but very alcoholic and malty. You can feel the 46% on this one. Recommend a few drops of water to tone down the sharp alcohol and brighten the flavors to the forefront."
3.25,"Malt cereal forward with tasting notes leading to sweet fruit at mid-palate.  Not a sweet beginner whisky. But it is far from challenging, like a Campbeltown, Island, or Islay.  It does get milder, and smoother, with a couple of teaspoons of water.  

Not much, or no, peat.  

It is doubtful that I'll buy another bottle. But who knows where my mood will take me at the store?  Oh, and the cork is, aesthetically, the most pleasing cork I've ever seen.

Big fan of this one. Deanston impresses again. Light, earthy and floral, with a nice side of sweetness. Nothing too bold or unique, but a really nice balance of flavors with a great nose.

It has some orchard fruits, cooked spices, cinnamon, vanilla and a bit of honey or caramel too. The mouthfeel is fantastic; coating and mouth-watering. The finish brings out more oak, a hint of char, and fades to ginger with light fruit. Overall, this is a great scotch and has more going on then many 12-year-olds in the same category.

4.0,"I would like to credit Roy from Aqvavitae on YouTube for giving this whisky his endorsement, otherwise for $90 Canadian I would have passed on it.   I was very surprised by the depth of Deanston's virgin  oak for the value compared to the negative reviews it recieved, and feel the exact same way about this particular whisky as well.  I had a suspicion that the older bottle with the darker label that most people have reviewed couldn't be the same whisky Roy and I were tasting, and earlier today Ralphy on YouTube pretty much confirmed it.   Granted I could see how coming from ultra premium scotch could make Deanston 12 seam dull,  to me it's head and shoulders above a lot of other 12 year olds I've had.  It's much closer to a 15 year old to my nose and taste buds on the arrival, but slightly harsh on the nose.   It's a very fruity/vanilla style whisky with full body.  Very satisfying to me."

3.0,"Color: The color on this scotch is a pale straw color. Clearly no coloring has been added, which, I'm not going to complain about that, but I do appreciate when it's just the whisky, pure and simple. There are oily legs that like to stick around on the inside of my glen.

Nose: On the nose I find salted caramel, briny beachfront, and notes reminiscent of life on a farm; hay, flowers, and honey mostly.

Taste: The palate is really tasty and creamy. There are notes of honeysuckle, vanilla coffee creamer, and for me a blueberry note. I added a few drops of water and it really mellowed it out; I don't really recommend it. For me the only new note that emerged was a dandelion green.

Finish: The finish is pretty short but it's crisp and fresh reminding me of some Colorado bourbons I've had. Little to no burn rewards your swallow. And there is an aftertaste of cinnamon breath mints that rises up inviting you to another sip, or at least has your mouth feeling clean.

Thoughts: I'm a fan! Especially after reading Deanston’s story online. Knowing their pursuit for community and their striving for the purity of their product gives me a great deal of respect for what they're doing and I'm glad to have tried the fruit of their labor. Thumbs up! Sláinte!"

4.0,"I was looking for something new to celebrate Burns Night last Thursday and I picked this bottle. Deanston is a relatively new highland distillery that only opened in 1965 in an old cotton mill that dates back to 1785 on the river Teith. This whisky is bottled at 46.3% ABV and is non-chill filtered, “as it should be”, according to the label. Not sure about coloration; it seems a bit dark to me. It is aged in bourbon barrels, is a nice golden amber in the glass and produces plentiful legs when swirled. 

The nose screams “this is Scotch!” to me: floral and fruity, with hints of salt and smoke. Not Islay peat smoke, but charred oak smoke. Apples, pears, and citrus with vanilla, caramel, and oak notes from the bourbon barrels. Really nice. 

The palate is a little hot at first but quickly turns sweet and spicy: honey and vanilla  with cinnamon and nutmeg. There is a malty component that brings a thick mouthfeel. The finish is medium, malty, rich, and warm. 

This is pretty easy drinking and would be a good choice or someone new to Scotch coming from bourbon. I really like this dram. I found it for $55 locally and see that it runs $65-70 online. $55 is a good deal for this bottle. Solid 4.0/5. Cheers!"

3.0,"Scotland, September 2017. Whisky #6.

Nose: Faint cereal, citrus and a little oak. A yeasty hint.

Palate: Fruity with some vanilla, but a bit thin in the body. Frankly I thought it was somewhat rough.

Finish: Spicy and with an accompanying alcohol burn.

Not much more to say. I tasted this at the distillery after a tour but I can't see myself ever buying it. It is generally well reviewed and popular and I wish I could support them more, but it's just not to my taste.

UPDATE: January 2018. I sampled this again at a whisky shop tasting last night and took notes without referring to my previous review. My thoughts were much the same as before, but it did make a more favourable impression this time. I noticed the mild spiciness of the spirit more in the palate and did not find it so rough, but it is still far from a favourite.

3.5,"Some Scottish distilleries are fairly average at best. However, given a craft presentation, the intrinsic quality of a previously overlooked Single Malt can improve significantly. Deanston 12 is a good example. Floral honey, breakfast cereals and whiffs of fresh oak characterize the nose. It’s soft, fresh and almost Irish with lots of 'green' notes. The taste unfolds strong and biscuity with vanilla fudge, sour citrus and hints of cough syrup. Straightforward, mildly bitter and gingery sweet in its long finish, this Cinderella malt proves to be highly underestimated.

RATING: 3.5/5.0 stars ≙ 84 pts → ABOVE AVERAGE"

3.0,"It is what it is. And there's nothing wrong with that. Touch is smoke on the nose and that's about it. On the palate, there's apples and bitter tea and some spice that tingles the tongue. A bit boring and i one dimensional but enjoyable nonetheless if looking for something good but don't want to think too much about and also reasonable for the price."
3.0,"Inoffensive, but painfully dull... so painful that it pains me to write this review. Weak nose, but faint notes of vanilla, cereal and oak emerge. There are hints of apples and honey, but otherwise a very dull palate. Following suit, a short and forgettable finish. This whisky gets three stars only because it's not downright disgusting."

Sweet. Smooth"
