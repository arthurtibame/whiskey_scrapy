3.0,"This is a fine enough Whiskey, and at $150 it would want to be. But at least half of that price seems to be in the cost of the solera system and its associated marketing. Somewhat reminiscent of Japanese whiskies like Nikka in its well balanced chocolate and caramel-ness, it's certainly a quality dram... but about twice as expensive as similar quality products."
2.75,Insipid? Lacking. Corona w lime.
4.25,"Pleasantly surprised with this drop. 
It has scotch-esque qualities. 
 Very easy to drink / smooth / non chill filtered. 
Vanilla on the nose and a very satisfying sipping experience. 
The spirit is understandably quite youthful with some faint background notes of caramel and burnt oranges. A little more maturity and intensity would really push this into becoming Australia’s leading non-single-cask/non-small-batch general release. 
Cons: Price, too expensive and needs a few more years."
