3.0,The nose has a slight fruity wine smell mixed with oak and alcohol. The drink itself is light yet strong. The slight wine taste comes through with a slight bitter and peppery finish.

3.0,"I don't usually do re-reviews; typically, I adopt the same attitude as Pontius Pilate in John's Gospel and declare that ""what I have written, I have written."" (Bet that's the first time Pilate's been quoted in a whiskey review). That said, this bottle, sadly, has earned a demotion and with it a new write-up. From the get-go, there was a certain almost-chemical note that I could never peg. In and amongst the sweet wine finish notes and and spices, it drifted - like a cheap shoe sole, or a garden hose, or a tennis ball..very rubbery. I figured it would go away with time. It didn't. It proved too off-putting for me to find this whiskey enjoyable, despite the many good things it does have going for it. Really rather disappointing."

4.0,"This has unrivaled character and depth to it. It's like nothing I've ever tasted before. Initially, I just didn't get it. After a second dram, I can't think of many other whiskeys that satisfy in such a unique way. This is complex and smooth with little bite. It's easy to sip and has just enough satisfying warmth to keep you coming back for more. Let it sit on your mouth a moment to fully experience its woody and dark wine-like notes. This is one I've shared that everyone seems to love. (FWF share #18)

4.5,"This is delicious whiskey. The palate comes swiftly with sweet and fruity notes of honey, prunes, raisins, dates, brown sugar from the unique finish. Not to be overshadowed, however, are vanilla, caramel, and pastry dough which arrive to balance things out. The medium-long finish adds a touch of spice to this unique experience."

2.25,"What started out promising as interesting & unique eventually evolved into dull & average as I worked my way through the bottle. Sometimes the appreciation of a whisky is enhanced over the course of a bottle & sometimes the opposite happens (as in this case). Sweet and wine-like fruitiness on the senses leads to a decent chest warmth. Probably worth trying but picking up a bottle not recommended - after finishing just shy of half the bottle, I happily donated the remainder to the ping pong crew.

Rating: Not sure if the Distiller score is grading on the American distillery curve here, but it’s 10 points too high for me. In fact, if I have any additional pours of this, I fear there’s a slight possibility I end up rounding down to two stars."

4.0,"A fun one that's a bit like coloring outside the lines. The nose is a mix of buttery, smooth oak, light brown sugar, dark cherries and other red fruits. On the tongue, it starts smooth with a little juiciness and a not-quite-smoke depth to it, then plateaus and leaves a hint of the Bordeaux-style wine on the finish. Drinkable neat."

3.5,High corn content on the nose. A corn whisky beginning with a lot of wood and some earthiness. The Bordeaux does come through on the finish but I expected more.  Worth a try for being complex but I feel it was over aged in the oak.

4.5,"Nose... Fruity and floral, and easily picking up on the Bordeaux Papillon.

Appearance... Darker than most, possibly due to the secondary aging. A maroon, cherry hue.

Taste... Wow! Immediately it reminded me of a chocolate covered cherry, not in the flavor, though there are hints of chocolate and cherry in the wine profile, but like the candy itself, this whisky has a 2-step flavor profile. You get an instant taste of an apparently great Bordeaux, that is then followed up by a fantastic whisky. So much cocoa and fruit that is chewy and lasts long after you've swallowed. 

Overall, it's a huge success in my book. Drinking this as a dessert drink neat is a no brainier. Grab a bottle if you can."

3.0,"Nose is reminiscent of a very clean corn whiskey; doesn’t seem to have a lot going on. Palate is quite dry and almost earthy, like a well-made rye. The sips after the first reveal a very cool deep baked goods quality, like a dark breakfast muffin with a hint of molasses, with some butterscotch in there as well. There is a strange, subtle dark-berry-without-the-sweetness note at the end that I assume is the wine barrel influence. Overall, a pretty interesting whiskey that seems to be priced well (~43 USD where I am), but it seems more like a fortuitous end to an experiment than a purposeful flavor profile."

3.0,"Am on my second bottle this year so I must like it. Being a fan of Orin Swift/David Phinney wine creations, this was a natural on the Whiskey curiosity scale. Have a good many mixed feelings about this one. At $50, it noses well, tastes very sweet but only middlin' on the tongue and finishes with a dry woodiness that tastes odd, at least to me. I don't know whether this taste is more from the 9 years of American Oak, for some unusual reason, or the particular wine barrel finishing. It is different and takes some time getting used to ... and being retired and having the time, it's not a problem. In fact, I consider this another in a long list of easy sipping whiskeys. The very high corn content makes it sweet to begin with, which is a familiar taste with many American Whiskeys. The wine barrel ageing either adds to the strange woodiness I'm tasting or helps to ameliorate what would be an even stronger presence without it. The aftertaste IMHO is the biggest letdown. The tongue keeps a dry dullness to it long after the swallow, forcing another blast of sweetness to make it go away. At best 3 stars ... but since I'm on my second bottle, I must at least subconsciously understand why others rate it higher. :-)"

2.0,"I have been curious about this whiskey as I am typically a fan of wine finished Rye and Bourbon. This was offered as a $5 special pour, so I thought why not. 
Upon entry you are immidiately hit with syrupy sweetness and not in a great way. The taste is similar to an artificial sweetness (think sweet'n'low). To be honest it's hard to pull much else out of this one on the mid pallette. The finish does linger and you do get a touch or red fruit with some drying oak. Probably the best part of this pour. As you sit the lingering flavors are pleasant. I just wish the rest of this whiskey was that good.
The puzzling part is that this whiskey was rested in barrels that housed a Bourdeux blend red wine. You would expect to have more of a dry and tart effect versus this super sweet taste profile. It's like it sat in an ice wine barrel! 
I would pass on this one. Even for a $5 pour, I would not buy it again."

4.5,"This is probably the most appropriately named whiskey ever! It’s unique and so, so good. Seriously, it’s a flavor that reminds of bourbon paired with an expertly prepared medium rare steak. Think blood red, like a deep red wine. Compared to other bourbons at this price point, it’s very smooth and sip worthy with a distinctive taste that’s very enjoyable but with a surprising aftertaste thats a semi-dry red wine. It’s strangely delightful and very addictive.  It’ll change your palate without threatening your safe space. Avoid their boring Straight Edge and dive right in to a very memorable dram that’s well priced and might possibly increase your appetite for animal."
4.0,"To my nose, this is a pretty classic American whiskey.  That continues on the palate, although the wine cask show up a bit on the mid palate, and then again very late on the finish. The wine cask doesn't dominate, and I'm caught between appreciating that and wishing it was just a bit stronger.  Regardless, very, very nice overall."
