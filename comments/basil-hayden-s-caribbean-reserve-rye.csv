4.25,Sweet molasses on the nose. Palate and mouthfeel is thin. Smooth but noticeable burn. The rum aftertaste is noticeable but compliments it well. Really wish it wasn’t limited.
3.75,"I am sure there are folks who will really appreciate this juice....for me, I thought it was alright. I tried it at a bar after having E. h. Taylor single barrel. I would rather have the Taylor."
3.75,"Actually very good.  Think of it as a spicier version of Knob Creek Smoked Maple.  The rum blends with the vanilla and oak to create a maple syrup note, both in the nose and on the front of the tongue.  The rye spice and the bitter barrel char balances the sweetness very well.  Very good under 40$ bottle."
4.0,"A refreshingly sweet whiskey. Brown sugar up front, vanilla and rum in the aftertaste."

4.5,Definitely taste the rum. Close to the basil two by two but with a molasses/rum aftertaste
4.0,"Rated on the basis of a finished whiskey. True score across whiskey spectrum would be about 3.25...

If you don't want to read further I'd place this between Angela Envy Rye and the Knob Creek Maple Syrup in terms of profile.

N: warm welcoming Rye spices and sweet brown sugar notes....great now I want breakfast

P: Baking spice sweeten into a nutty syrupy profile. Viscous but not thick like maple syrup. Reminds me of nut bread with syrup  drizzled over it. Awesome now I got my breakfast.

F: Repeat N and P but things start to mellow. Not short but not too long. Baking spices and those sugar notes don't go away begging you to pour more.


If you aren't a fan of sweet whiskey don't buy this. If you aren't a fan of barrel finishing...don't buy this. 

Would be interesting to use in place of rum in cocktails. Should just drink straight though. 

Never disliked a Product of their's except the pricing and availability of the 10.

Will buy again."

2.0,"Smell syrupy, very. Maple syrup, like smelling pancakes doused in syrup. Maple syrup and brown sugar on the palate. Very little spice. 6/21/19"
3.0,"The rum flavor is a bit too strong and overwhelms quite a bit of the rye.  The flavors are not melded or balanced enough.

it's not bad, just meh."
2.75,"Nose has a soft ripe fruit note, mixed with molasses and raisins. Can definitely detect the rum in the nose. The palate brings more molasses, ripe plum, and faint maple draped in mild rye spice and a medium quality rum. The lower proof is definitely noticeable. The finish is quick and brings back the aftertaste of something I can only compare to coke-a-cola or Pepsi. I want to like this much more than I do. This certainly does not compare to Angel’s Envy rye as this seems rather one dimensional. It’s definitely not bad, just nothing spectacular. Probably good on a hot day."

1.5,"Awful.  I could not stand to drink it straight.  I had to end up mixing it with coke and even in a 12 ounce can of coke the rum flavor was overpowering.  The rum flavor was just WAY too much.  It tastes more ""rummy"" than drinking straight rum neat.  This is probably the most disappointing bottle that I've purchased in recent memory.  The more I drank it, the less I liked it.  I will not buy again, and I'd caution those who are considering buying it - try it first unless you REALLY like blackstrap rum."

3.25,"Pours darker than most ryes, but lighter than black strap rum. The nose is more rum than rye. The flavor is a blend of the spicer American rye, the milder Canadian rye and the black strap Rum. As noted in other reviews, this comes across as maple syrup. There is a bit more rye spiciness in the finish. Overall this is a very good pour, that because of the sweetness would serve well as a digestif."

2.0,"Smell is strongly vanilla (probably from the rum finish) and peppery (rye). Toasted pecans on the palate, with rye in the background"
3.0,"The nose is very sweet, with molasses and brown sugar notes. First sip starts off with a very smooth, very mildly sweet fruity hit that is hard to identify (raisin/date/other?). That is quickly followed by molasses, but not too sweet. It finishes with a short mild spicy and a lingering molasses. Very unique flavor. Neat, the spice is more noticeable. Adding a couple drops of water opens up the sweetness slightly. With an ice cube, it really mellows out, and the taste becomes almost exclusively the hard to identify fruit. Overall impression: unique and different, but may be not a flavor profile I am in love with. Makes a decent Mint Julip, especially when mixed with Chocolate Mint."

I won’t drink it every day, but it’ll probably be a regular in my cabinet. If you don’t enjoy an occasional sweet pour, don’t even bother."

4.0,"I had wanted to try this for a while and finally got to at Whiskeyfest SF.  Admittedly I'd had several tastes before this but I did remember enjoying it so I picked up a bottle the other day and got to it.  I should preface this by saying this is not technically rye in the traditional sense.  It's rye with rum added and is NOT rum cask finished.  You really need to approach this from the perspective of ""it's something completely out of the box"".

Nose:  Bananas foster!  Dark caramelized sugars, molasses, ripe banana, vanilla, rum, and some ripe apple notes.

Flavor:  More bananas foster and I like it!  Tastes just like it smells though with a little bit of heat.  Kind of thin but very approachable with the lower proof.

Finish:  Finishes a little dryer than the taste but that isn't saying a lot given how sweet this is.  A hint of rye black pepper spice and herbal notes on the finish with just a little bit of barrel char.

I like this!  It's very desserty and sweet.  Does not check the box if I want a rye at all but definitely a great after dinner dram.  It's more of a digestif."

Interesting but Better stuff out there IMO."
2.25,Strong maple nose. Was disappointed with the lack of flavors after tasting.

2.5,"Neat.  Nose is molasses, vanila, molasses, alcohol, molasses, hint of rye baking spices.  Taste starts like standard BH rye baking spice profile, but quickly fades with molasses dominating.  Finish is molasses and hangover

Interesting concept.. I think that molasses rum notes could go well with baking rye spices, becoming very holiday like.. but the black rum dominates.  Maybe just the rum cask would have been enough..or cut the rum in half.  Regardless, it doesn't seem fitting for what is supposedly the best barrels of the high rye to be masked by something else.  I've always liked BH, but thought it was overpriced..This is worse juice at a higher price.  Just mix some OGD with some Myers and save some money"

Avent 2019 - 6/24.
Alors que la fête roule à plein lors de mon party de Noël de job, j'en profite pour ouvrir mon mini flasque d'une once de ce whisky vieilli en fûts de rhum. Un mélange de mélasse et d'épices que mon esprit n'arrive pas à apprécier. J'ai l'impression qu'il y quelque chose qui cloche.

There is a lot of maple syrup flavor on the nose and the taste but unlike in the AE, the rye spice peaks out more and it isn't nearly as sweet (but still very sweet). While it won't replace AE rye anytime soon for me, it is still a worthy challenger and this is a bottle I'm more likely to share."
