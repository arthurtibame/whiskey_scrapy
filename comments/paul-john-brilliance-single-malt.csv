2.0,Reminded me of why I didn't like whiskey when I was younger. Memories of Bell's came flooding back. Not recommended.

4.25,"Indian whisky keeps surprising me. This time, a 46%abv expression from Paul John Called ""Brilliance"", which allegedly uses barley grown at the Himalayas. 

On the nose, first aroma note caught my attention, it was Naranjilla. Naranjilla is a tropical fruit very popular in Ecuador, and the only other time i hace ever perceived it in a whisky was in another indian malt, amrut fusion. What a coincidence. 

Ok, the aroma is beautiful, Naranjilla, Vanilla, Milk powder, very citric.
Tobacco and Some dim chocolate fudge.

The palate was great also, with naranjilla and oranges with hints of chocolate. The promise from the nose, delivers on the mouth.

Aftertaste was a little less than the palate and nose, with just a peppery but pleasant finish. 

Overall this is a super interesting dram that i fully recommend, i don't think it is expensive at all, and it is a different whisky for you to try. 88 over 100."
3.0,"Ok. Leichte Schärfe, kurzer Abgang, nussig, holzig,"
2.5,"It’s nice. Aroma opens with a pleasant profile that sits as honey and malt with some dried notes and a touch nutty; Palate holds some big malty notes which kind of die-off but then come back through as it opens, pulling in some fruity notes; Finish is also pleasant."

3.0,"Interesting, easy-to-drink whisky. Lots of fruits there, some spices and honey contribute to a balanced liquor (more for beginners tough).
Solid position, but nothing extra ordinary."

3.0,"Honey nose, slightly sweet, do not like the after taste"
3.0,"I was lucky to attend a tasting with the founder of the distillery for their full flight of mainstream whiskies. This was the first cab off the rank. Lets see, honey, bit of spice. Unfortunately the alcohol even though only 46% overpowers the flavour profile. It's a younger whisky - several years old - with little viscosity or length of finish. Wouldn't buy a bottle"

2.0,Interesting nose and titillating palate. Alas way too short on the finish.
3.5,"Bourbon undertone. Spice on the palate and ginger. Bitterness on the finish - long. Wild. When it opens up there's plenty of granny smith apples. 

This whisky needs decanting then it opens up. 

Not bad, but no Amrut."

4.0,"I was gifted a bottle by some dinner guests last night—-popped it open and shared with the offerings for the night.  This is one of those that is designed to please everyone.  You can’t go in expecting a whirlwind of complexity or a Lagavulin gut punch.  But it’s one of those that when offered to 10 guests last night, all 10 would enjoy.   I had this out, along with Lagavulin 2018 Feis Ile, an Oregon Pinot, and a crispy French white.  He Lag remained untouched, while this was 1/2empty, and the two wines are fully empty.  Shows you the relative scale of where this falls.  Meant for the non-scotch /whiskey enthusiast.  Very much like a Balvenie 12—-except a bit stronger.  Heather and honey, green apples.  Cereals, a bit of floral lavender.  Not one for the seasoned veteran, but very much a non-gender specific crowd pleaser ."
