4.0,"Presented in a delightful corked bottle and accredited to the ""The Nose"" himself Richard Patterson, this whisky promises a lot just by its presentation and crudentials.
On the nose, it's light, a tiny pinch of ethanol, and then we're straight into a pot of honey, very sweet, very pleasant, not at all complicated.
On the palette it's a little spicy, slight notes of apple and almond, the honey has disappeared though, however it comes back on the finish, along with some smokiness, and the same citrus aftertaste you might expect from a Brewdog IPA, but very little heat, making it easy to drink fast (should you want to).
Overall it's an uncomplicated but well made whisky that forms a great foundation for new drinkers or those just wanting to relax with something nice and simple. The simplistic nature of it means you can enjoy this one over rocks without feeling too guilty about it. Absolutely recommend."
