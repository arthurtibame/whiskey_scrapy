4.25,"Nose: Honey, orange, baking spice. Taste: classic caramel and vanilla notes giving way to a lingering spice finish."
3.5,"Fruity, almost sour nose. Marshmallows as well. The palate is rich, peppery, with spice that lingers. Warm. Some clove honey. Orchard fruit and cacao nibs. Then, dill on the finish. Good follow-up to Batch 1. 2/22/19"

4.5,"The color is a rich amber with a nose that smells like a bakery pretty much. Burst of nutmeg is balanced by vanilla, custard, caramel and a touch of buttercream frosting. The bakery continues on the palate with vanilla, caramel and toffee as the focus, balanced by a touch of fruit sweetness, nutmeg and rye spice, with salted peanut. The finish is medium long with cinnamon, vanilla and peanut balanced by caramel and oak, countering the sweet palate."

4.75,"An initial and immediate nose of honeydew. the most subtle and balanced nose of baked goods and warm unleavened dough. the slightest bit of cardamom and allspice. a barely-there hint of brine. 
such a smooth and clean taste. peanut shells and cinnamon. creamy mouthfeel. more cinnamon and sugar. slight orange aftertaste.
9/10."
4.5,"Very robust rye whiskey.  Spicy rye on the palate with maraschino cherries and vanilla.  I get a bit of caramel as I sit and drink the glass over time.  I feel like it needs 20-30 minutes to breathe before all the flavors truly arrive.  Great smokey notes and barrel char that persist in the very long finish.  The finish in this whiskey is superlatively long - it persists and lingers for hours in my mouth if I don't drink anything else or eat something strongly flavored - excellent spice, smoke, and barrel char.  My only complaint about this whiskey is the price.  It runs about $200 in my market.  I feel like it should be more in the $120-130 range, but it's fantastic if not a bit too expensive."

4.0,Smooth Rye. Honestly the spice notes are so subtitle that I thought I had to check the label to make sure it was a rye whiskey.
4.75,"This is a very flavorful rye.  Nose, taste experience, finish, all A+.   I need to find a bottle."
4.25,"Delicious rye especially below $100. Fruit, and rye bread mostly on the nose. 

Opens up on the palette with nice warm oak tones that are followed by brine, rye and peanut. 

Nice dry linger and is pleasant hot and full of banana notes."
4.5,Amazing. Tiny bit of pickle flavor. Super smooth and delicious. Really a great drinker. Drank neat.
4.25,"Let it sit for 15-20 minutes to let all the flavors come out.  I get a lot of flavors from this - maraschino cherries, brown sugar, a spicy rye bite, a hint of mint, some vanilla, cookie dough.  This whiskey has a long woody, char, rye finish.  This is a great whiskey- it's almost worth the price.  I enjoy it quite a bit, but I'm not sure that I'd buy another bottle at the ~$200 price tag unless I had a sudden windfall."
