5.0,"Nose: Very peaty, just the way I like it. Strong with sweet, spicy peat. Sophisticated smoke, like a bonfire which has been put out in a wet soil. Spicy meat and sweet fruits mixed together nicely. Water brings out the fruits even more, oranges dominating.

Taste: Mix of fruits and earthly peat smoke. Full and juicy sweet, yet robust with rough, salty peat and warming with spices. Nicely oily. Addition of water makes it more fruitier.

Finish: Long lasting roasted dryness. Coal, peat and spices. Water makes the finish much smoother but then again, it loses some character.

Balance: Excellent dram and I do like the finish, even though I usually don't stand too much dryness. This whisky has a nice roasted dry note, which makes it perfect."

4.0,"Nose: Wow, weird!  Cooked strawberries?  Rotten rum?  Definitely peated and definitely fruity.  A big, bad confusing stew of earth and sweet, cooked red fruits.  This is sure to be a polarizing whisky at your next tasting with friends.
Palate: The port and the peat haven't quite married together, making for a disjunct experience, but it's huge, flavorful, and IMHO fun.
Final Thoughts: Definitely disjunct, definitely weird, but definitely high quality and I definitely liked it.  Great stuff."

null,"The nose is all red fruit! Grilled strawberries, vanilla bean, red apples, smooth and creamy. The initial flavor is surprisingly smooth for 50% ABV. The nose is repeated on the tongue but with the addition of white pepper, chocolate covered cherry cordials, and a Connemara-like peat; not smoke but phenolic peat. The two are riding a tandem bicycle, the peat is pedaling in the back seat and the Sherry is pedaling and steering. The two are disjointed in that the two are distinct flavor a that go back and forth on the nose and tongue. Water softens the peat and sweetens the dram and brings with it oranges, of all things. Non-chill filtered, no coloring added, 50% ABV, 17 years old, picked up for $102. Welcome to the collection! 89 out of 100."

5.0,"One of the things I learned quite by accident in trading samples is that we get to try whisky that we otherwise wouldn't have the opportunity for whatever reasons.  BenRiach is one of them.  If it weren't for Lee sending a generous sample, I'd never even think of buying this bottle.  I probably passed by this brand a few times without even thinking twice of buying it, probably because of the high price combined with the general ignorance of the brand.  This dram is really good, and makes me think port and peat go together like peanut butter and jelly.  First of all, I love the color!  It's a burnt sienna, fall-autumny color.  On the nose, the peat isn't overwhelming, but plays well in the background with red fruits like raspberries.  On the palette, it changes quite a bit from red fruits to smoked meat and plums.  I'm getting a bit of wasabi and ginger too.  It leaves a long lingering ginger and smoked tea, like oolong.  Really recommended, and quite a positive departure from your run of the mill Speysiders.  Another great sample provided by Lee...thank you!!!"
5.0,"I decided to try another BenRiach based on my friend Paul's recommendation so I decide to splurge on a higher end, older bottle from their heavily peated, Solstice Series.  This 17 year old replaces the 15 year and comes in at a nice, rounded 100 proof.  It is on the pricier end at $170, but I really think it's worth every penny.

It's advertised as heavily peated and finished in port wine barrels for an astonishing 4 years!  I've gotta say, that was time very well spent.  It's a deep copper in color, with a slight red tint when you hold it up to the light.  It's very oily and sticks to the side of the tasting glass when you give it a solid swirl.  That vigorous swirl also released an unbelievable aroma into the air- tons of raspberries and currants flow up and over the top of the Glencairn.  There is even a very noticeable chocolate sweetness when you stick your nose down into it.  Flat out amazing.  It's another scotch I could just sit and sniff and be thoroughly entertained.

I keep giving it a nice swirl just to keep inhaling those beautiful berries and chocolate.  There's no way the taste can live up to the aroma.  No way.  After 15 minutes the smoky peat has added another delicious element to the nose.

On the tongue it begins softly enough with just a creamy wash of red berry and chocolate.  Damn, this may be the first time I've ever just straight up noticed sweet, milk chocolate in a single malt.  It's there on the nose and it coats the tongue so wonderfully. On cue, the peat smoke makes an appearance and leads the way into a long, satisfyingly hot finish.  You can really tell the proof is high, but it all feels right.  The perfect way to wash the sweetness away and really leave you wanting more.  This is the best Speyside scotch I think I've ever had.  Amazing stuff.

This is definitely a bottle worth searching for and splurging on.  It's a wonderful example of experimentation by a distillery that doesn't really specialize in the style, but boy, did they knock one out of the park here.  I'm already looking for a bottle to replace this one.  It's that damn good.  It also reaffirms my thought that peated whisky and port barrels are a match made in heaven.  Cheers, my friends"

4.0,"Nose: Pungent and assertive, hefty peat, fruity and well-rounded notes of red berries, cloves, aniseed and orange zest. The peat-smoke never loses the upper hand but it remains well-balanced. As it develops in the glass the smoke intensifies at first but then as you become used to it, it seems to fade and the winey-berry-spice facet dominates. Adding just enough water to drop the abv to about 45% does no harm at all. It removes the ""prickle"" of highish ethanol and allows the fruity elements to come forward. Excellent both neat and watered. [The dry glass is all earthy peat-smoke].

Palate: Big intense arrival - sweet, peaty and fruity with expansive berry notes again. It's a commanding entry but again I found it quite well-balanced and enjoyable at neat strength. There's a richness to the palate that is almost meaty (reminiscent of bacon - a hint of saltiness) and the texture is full and rounded. Some tannins creep in during the mid-palate but they are polite and well-behaved, contributing a chocolate character. There is a little gingery spice but it's not a hot palate at all, just intense. Adding a little water blooms the sweet and fruity aspects considerably and modulates the peat smoke without spoiling it. Dilution is well recommended.

Finish: Long. The sweet tannic undercurrent slowly fades and ashen Speyside-style peat reek echoes into the distance. The aftertaste is of cold lapsang souchong tea. Water again slightly sweetens the aftertaste but it remains enfolding and long with the tea character moving more towards creosote.

Intensely peaty, unusually so for BenRiach - this profile is moving slightly more in the direction of Islay peat-reek than Speyside smokiness. Indeed, it occasionally brought both Caol Ila and Kilchoman to mind, but it's not at all medicinal.

The official rating here is pretty much on target but I don't agree with the official comments. I also noticed after I'd written this that David Broom on Whiskey Advocate didn't think much of it. Fine, I've never thought much of his reviews.

Many thanks to @Soba45 for the tasting sample. The price I've quoted is for when it was last available, as an indication. What a pity it's no longer around - I'd buy a bottle without hesitation.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"
4.25,"I really don't like having to many bottles open. With all the other sampling they often take a while to get through and whilst initially improve after a few months open generally start to go down hill after that. I made an exception and busted this one out as amazingly I can still get more bottles so I wanted to see if it was worth the $110USD. Definitely is the answer, I'll place hold at 4.5 for now but it's shaping up to rise higher I think. I really love the peat port combo. Not quite as much as sherry peat but close. This is very well done and along with the Benriach 18 Albariza, Johnnie Walker Blue Label Port Ellen & Rare (Ghost & Rare), Kavalan Solist Sherry Cask Matured, Benriach 22 year Moscatel wood finish, Talisker 8 Year Old (Special Release), Glendronach Cask 2683 - 24 year 1991, Booker's 6 year True Barrel Bourban Batch 2107-01E, Woodwinters ‘Isle Solera’ 16 Year Old, Batch 1 35 years old (That Boutique-y Whisky Co.) round out my top 10 whiskies for 2019 - yup I'm calling it early this year!
Update Jan 2020: I'm thinking rather than going up it's going the other way the more I drink it more a 4.25"

5.0,"Review transfer from Barreled from January 2017. 

This Benriach is the second edition of their heavily peated tawny port finished limited releases, replacing the 15 year first edition. It weighs in at 50% ABV, is non chill filtered and a natural color of  amber bronze. 

Big earthy peat on the nose. This is not to be confused with Islay peat, which is briny, medicinal, and tarry. This is more vegetal. Think forest vs sea side. Huge fruity notes. Red berries and dark stone fruits like plums. If you can let this sit long enough for the peat to fade there are lovely notes of sweet BBQ, oak, sweet red wines, and new leather. Very complex and I could nose it all day. 

The palate was much more intense than I expected, but at 50% ABV I should have been ready for it. Slightly hot and spicy at first but it does settle down nicely. BBQ pulled pork/chicken, grilled fruits. Big peat smoke, but also wood smoke like smoldering mesquite or hickory chips, and of course oak. 

The mouthfeel is a bit hot at first, but only briefly. Oily and intense. Mouthwatering initially but turns slightly dry. The finish is medium long with more sweet BBQ and peaty goodness. 

I wish I would have known about this whisky when it hit the market. I would have bought 2 bottles in a heartbeat. It's a real shame that something this good is a limited release. These port finished scotches are quickly becoming my drink of choice, and it really seems to lend itself well to peated scotches, more so than non peated ones. If you happen to see a bottle somewhere, just take out your wallet, pay for it, and thank yourself later. 5 stars and a big thanks to @LeeEvolved 
Cheers

Addendum: I did find a bottle and I am saving it for a special occasion. It’s a real beauty"
