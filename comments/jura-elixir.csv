Almond, vanilla and banana on the nose. There's wood on the palate with a touch of spice. Finish is weak and short."

3.0,"Lovely deep plum, with wood & as a hint of spice. The finish is sweet & rather quick, but a very tasty dram."
2.0,"Dark, bitter flavor. Burns."
4.0,"Notes of vanilla, honey, caramel, and dessert wine on the nose, with a hint of smoke and sea hiding at the end. The flavor is heavy on the sweet notes up front (caramel and toffee), with lingering vanilla at the end."
