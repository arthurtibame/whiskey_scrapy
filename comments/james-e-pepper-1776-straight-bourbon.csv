2.75,"After my excellent experience with the JP rye I was on the lookout for this bourbon. Found last lonely bottle on the shelf. Very high rye% at 39 and 100 pf non chill filtered. Poured neat, a swirl gives a nice glasscoat. Noses spicy nutty caramel, seasoned wood, some birch beer notes, maple syrup, dusty rye and a bit of sting to the nostrils( fades at rest). Palate is heavy smack of smoky dark caramel oak, rye spice heat, cocoa powder, melting butterscotch and some glove leather. Its a little hot at 100pf and tastes young with flavors not fully developed. Finish is lengthy charred oak with butterscotch and rye spice drying slowly. The high rye kicks up the spice and the 100pf adds in making an overall too hot impression. Needs more maturation for depth and roundness.............77/100...........Belle Meade is similar profile and far superior imo"
2.75,"Nose: sweet like a candy for me, some spice
Palate: bites with pungent spiciness, sweet
Finish: sweet, spicy, short"
5.0,Rich flavor and incredibly smooth.

3.0,"The first thing I notice is the spice, lots of spice. Prominent notes of vanilla, cinnamon followed by heat. Though the more i have the sweeter it becomes. It's exactly as ""raw and aggressive"" as the review would lead you to believe. Not exactly my taste I'll admit since i prefer something smoother that comes with an age statement. Glad i happen to try it but i won't be buying a bottle."

2.0,Immature and harsh. Pure marketing on the bottle. You can get a bottle of Woodford for $10 less. Stear clear.

3.0,"Sweet vanilla, notes of cinnamon and a dash of clove balanced out by some lively oak tannins. Great easy drinking bourbon. Not quite bold enough for a sour, but it's rye contents leads enough complexity that it is easy to work into a Manhattan or an old fashioned"

Cinnamon, spice, & some brown sugar on the nose.  Palate’s more cinnamon & spice w/ a nice mouthfeel.  Finish is  cinnamon, rye spice, & dry."
