4.5,"Domo Arigato Mr. Roboto! Japanese Whisky Always good (read that in a Japanese Accent).

Bottled at 43%abv, it has a mahogany color. 

This one was my third dram of the night, and even if it felt similar than Macallan's Whisky Makers Edition, i can tell you this: Yamazaki was a lot better (and cheaper).

On the nose: cherry cola, wet forest, sherry, toasted bread, orange peel, maple honey, grape juice notes.

On.the palate: oak, grape juice, sherry, orange, pepper, maple honey and liquorice.  Full bodied and a nice finish. Wonderful.

Overall it is a powerful 94 out of a 100, very recommended."

3.0,It may be psychological but I definitely prefer Nikka's offerings to Suntory. That said Yamazaki is a great drink and the benchmark for entry level Japanese whisky.  Sweet and tasty making for a perfect highball. Not bad neat and I try to keep a bottle at home.

4.0,Starts of light crisp and then the sweetness and beautiful spice kicks in nicely. A lot closer to the Yamazaki 12 as compared to the hakushu distillers which is quite way off the hakushu 12.

3.0,"A nose of fluffy malt, vanilla, rich Sherry fruit, a waft of dry smoke. The palate starts with rich vanilla, baked apples, dry berries, refreshing light spices, and a chimney smoke finish. There's a shadow of American oak throughout this. Overall, it's a little east meets west. Though the smokey finish is a bit much for all the delicacy before it."

4.0,"Sherry for days, a bit of sweet oak, strawberry, fruit jellies (sweeter, lighter smell than jams), cherry, and a bit of acetone define the nose.  The taste is smooth and impressive for a NAS whiskey -- honey-coated almonds, a bit of Christmas season spices, cherry, and some caramel from the oak, almost like a slightly diluted bourbon flavor.  The finish is well-integrated and just pleasant.  I get sherry again, a bit of creaminess to balance the tartness, a quite prominent cherry, again a bourbon-like element (spice, mint, a touch of bitterness as if the cherry pits are in there too), and a final wisp of raspberry flavor as the long finish fades to black.
    
    OK, the world has been going a bit mad for Japanese whiskies for a few years now.  I even remember the turning point in the DC area.  Sometime back in 2014, I saw Yamazaki 12 on the shelf for $90, but opted for Hakushu 12 at $70, thinking to myself that was already a high price to pay for a 12-year whiskey.  By the time I went back a few months later, both were $100.  By the time I went back a year later, they weren't even on the shelf anymore.  I did enjoy a few Yamazaki 12 drams at Big in Japan bar in Montreal in 2015, which was one of the cooler bars I'd been in at the time (the décor consisted of dozens of bottles of 12 and other Japanese expressions hanging from the ceiling, and patrons could buy a personal bottle that would hang up there, but would be their exclusive bottle to enjoy whenever they returned).  Out of curiosity I looked at the bar's menu again this week, and it didn't even list Yamazaki 12 as an option anymore, only Suntory Toki.  It may be 10-12 years until Japanese production catches up to this market so that we can once again enjoy their whiskies at reasonable cost and with reasonable availability.  Such is life.
    
    Leaving that long-winded digression behind, I personally wouldn't bite the bullet and pay the $100+ that this whiskey costs (at least according to Wine Searcher).  That being said, it's a worthy successor to the 12, and if I'd tasted it blind I probably would have guessed it was a 15-year old whiskey.  It outshines many Highland or Speyside malts in the $60-80 range.  Thanks to Davie Warner for the sample!"
3.0,"Another 200ml bottle shared by my old friend living in Japan, designed for the native market, with almost no English on the label. 

Nose: Delicate, tart kiwi (tell-tale mizunara oak), sweet Dijon mustard, gingerbread with a seam of lemon zest throughout. Sadly lacks the rosewater note I recall from the 12 year bottling.

Palate: Zesty, baking spices arrive first, transitions through vanilla to a floral soapiness.

Finish: Full and bittersweet, hint of pickled ginger with a distant light waft of charcoal lingering longest. To my memory, not as enjoyable as the 12, but still seething with quality... 

Dry glass: hemp rope."

3.0,"The nose is quite reminiscent of sherry, it has notes of dried fruits, vanilla, toffee, and a some of wood (likely the mizunara). The palate is vanilla, and fruits like apple, orange, dark cherries, some cereal and then loads of spice cumulating in a decently long finish of wood, spices, and a bit of sherry and tartness. 

*I recommend using a copita glass when drinking this neat as opposed to a normal glencairn glass (which I used for the initial review) as the sweetness and sherry/vanilla notes are more pronounced and the spiciness is mellowed out, which enhances the overall experience of drinking this whisky."

4.0,"Wow! Nose: pears, strawberries; Palate:-initially very subtle, yes, the strawberries are there, ok, more spicy fruits, berries, vanilla, but it is subtle, classy. You have to savour this because it is delicate, like a japanese bamboo garden; Finish:- medium, attractive, smooth. Compared to Nikka from the Barrel it is far more delicate. Don't drink this  if tasting Speyside or Islay in same evening, doesn't work. Do some yoga, get into a state of harmony, then try this. No water or anything else required. It's weird how our tongues are different, there is no sherry here! Too subtle for winter, a spring/summer drink. Good price as well, they could easily sell it for more - please don't."

Different, yes, better, no. Sweet floral malt wafts through my sinuses in the finish. Good, but nothing to write to Tokyo about. Cheers!"

3.75,"My second Japanese whisky tasting, my first Yamazaki.

This one is sold out almost everywhere and well hyped up, perhaps a bit controversialto some? Well, I tasted it with an open mind as with any dram that I taste.

The notes on the nose gave me some sweetness of fresh fruits, on the berry side. Floral tones to accompany them and then I put my nose in the Glencairn where marzipan and vanilla lingered in the background.

I got a tart, tingling sensation on the toungue but this time also tannins for a dry feel. I attribute this to the Bordeux and Sherry casks, which explains the berries on the nose. Those berries also lingers on the palate as well as citrus from the tartness.

The finish did not linger but did give me a clear oak note that was good to me. I haven't had a Japanse whisky matured in a Mizunara cask before, so I would like to compare this to other drams that have.

An enjoyable single malt for sure, I wish the finish would give me more. A revisit or comparison to the Yamazaki 12yo is in order!
Either way the Japanese drams are intriguing.

TASTE: Clean and smooth. Like biting into a fresh strawberry. Oak and red wine tannins are there.

FINISH: Oily and smooth, develops some turmeric and cinnamon, leaves you with sweet strawberry at the end!

OVERALL: Floral and fresh strawberries make a light yet sophisticated drinking whiskey. Improves flavors with a drop of water."

4.0,"Thanks to a blind tasting flight challenge sent to me by @Generously_Paul I was able to sample this NAS Yamazaki whisky.

I don’t have the typical notes I like to take as I was more tuned in towards trying to identify the differences between 5 different whiskies and spirits.  This one stood out particularly because of the different types of wood they use in Japan.  Sandalwood and Mizunara oak offer a very different take on the aromatics.  More tropical and fruity flavors come through on the palate as well.  This is very different than most scotches and provides an awesome take on single malts.  

This is easily a 3.75-4 star Yamazaki, even though it’s a NAS.  It’s pretty close to the 12yo, but still miles away from the 18.  At the price point of $65-70 though- it’s a pretty good deal if you can find it.  Thanks again, Paul.  Cheers."
4.0,"This was sent as a blind tasting challenge by my motor city buddy @Generously_Paul sent 5 samples.  I guessed 3 right, and named this one precisely as Yamazaki Distiller ( the sandalwood aroma gave it away). I’m a huge fan of Yamazaki.  Their 18 is my top 3-4 single malts.  This has that classic Asian temple sandlewood aroma, followed by a nutty hazelnut flavor.  Well made, as expected out of Yamazaki"

Pretty interesting paired with smoked nuts, brings out the grain. Didn't care for it with milk chocolate or walnuts."

3.5,"I was putting together an online order from Master of Malt (back when they still shipped to the US) and needed a lower cost bottle to help justify the shipping cost and I landed on this bottle of Yamazaki Distiller’s Reserve. It was a little under $70 and not available in the States so I jumped on it. Bottled at 43% ABV, is most likely chill filtered and most likely has colorant added making it an amber gold. This is matured in a combination of American, European and Japanese Mizunara oak. 

The nose is light and delicate, but very floral and fruity. Chamomile, orange & cherry blossoms. Tangerines, apricots, oranges, peaches and cherry cordials. Lemons, almonds, strawberries, vanilla buttercream, mint, mint chocolate, honey and barley sugar. Quite malty at times. A whiff of earthy peat, faint leather and barrel char. Coffee, coconut, lime and raspberries- lots of raspberries. Some briny seashells, earthy red wine, cinnamon. Lovely Mizunara oak, red and green grapes and more vanilla. A little wood resin and a light caramel note at the bottom of the glass. Super complex, but sadly not overly impressive. 

The palate has plenty of oak and wood spices. Almond paste, raspberries, peaches and cherries. Red wine, semisweet chocolate, cinnamon, coconut and vanilla. Light floral notes and very light, earthy peat. Even though this is a single malt, I got a very grain-like creaminess and even harshness. This really takes the enjoyment down for me. 

A light to medium bodied mouthfeel that is creamy, mouth coating and dry. 
The finish is medium short with vanilla, coconut, raspberries, cinnamon, oak and red wine. Dry. 

The nose on this one is incredibly complex, especially for a NAS, but it’s just not that engaging. It doesn’t pop. The fact that the palate has an unavoidable harshness doesn’t help matters at all. I really did enjoy the nose in the sense that it challenged me to dig deep to find all the hidden notes (plus it’s quite elegant). In the beginning it screams Japanese, but as things progress it takes on more of a scotch feel, then works it’s way back again. I’m hoping the 12 year will treat me better than this NAS. 3.5-3.75
Cheers"

4.0,"I've had a couple of Japanese whiskeys recently that didn't quite live up to my high expectations (specifically, Hibiki Harmony and Yamazaki 12).  Happily, the Yamazaki Distiller's Reserve reversed that trend.  

The nose is very nice - lots of fruits, a grainy baked good that I think is closest to biscotti, and some vanilla cream.

The palate is fruity, creamy, a bit spicy and heavy on the oak.  I don't always enjoy heavy oak - it can tend towards a harshness for me.  But I didn't find the oak to be harsh here.

The DR contrasts sharply with the two whiskeys I mentioned above.  While I found the Harmony to be too delicate, the Yamazaki DR is quite robust - much more so than most Japanese whiskeys I've tried.  And I very much prefer the DR to the 12, which I find to have a few funky notes.  The DR is a really well integrated mix of sweet, spice, and wood.

My review is based on a sample, but I'm looking forward to obtaining a full bottle."
