4.0,"61.8% ABV Nose - (w/o water) Tropical floral fruity malt, sweet caramelized pineapple, oak aged apple cider (w/ water) brings out an additional hint of ripe plantains and more of a creamy sweet.
  Taste - (w/o water) Spicy sweet floral honey, lightly bitter vanilla, hint of bitter citrus pith (w/ water) tones down the burn significantly revealing a really dry citrusy barrel aged apple/pear cider, bitterness is subdued a bit, more caramelized honey notes.
  Finish - (w/o water) Hot spice from the proof, mouth drying, lingering fruity floral sweet spiced honey (w/ water) burn is significantly toned down, bittersweet like orange pith with a hint of vanilla & honey.
  Score - 88/100
  Final Thoughts - This is a very nice single malt, has some nice tropical notes I like as it's different from most single malt Scotch. Water does this single malt wonders as it's a bit of a hot mess at the bottling proof. The water tones the alcohol burn down and opens up to a nice tropical vanilla honey. Not something I'd reach for very often, but it's a nice non-sherried, non-peated offering that offers nice tropical notes."

3.25,"AMRUT INDIAN CASK STRENGTH 61.8%
NOSE : 코코넛, 빗속 엄청 가벼운 바닐라
PALATE : 솔티, 옅은 플로랄
FINISH : 스모키, 스파이시, 쌉쌀함"
3.25,"Amrut; distilled in the heat of India. Yes, that means more barrel contact for the juice inside in a shorter period of time and yes, the cask strength means that this guy is a hot beast.

Almost too hot.

Now don't get me wrong, I like my whiskey cask strength, but the heat on this one distracts from the coffee/toffee flavors buried inside. I suggest add water....and don't be shy about it.

Once added, this tames the beast and the flavors start to reveal themselves. Cloves, baking spices, coffee, malt, they are all there. Thank goodness.

I like this bottle. It is distinct, like most of the Amrut line, so this bottle is good to have on the shelf for diversity purposes. Would I buy one again. Eh, probably not now."

4.5,Takes all the unique flavors of Amrut and amplifies it. Really intense finish with lovely oak and dense fruity and slight bourbon vanilla/caramel sweetness from the ABV.

4.0,Loving these Indian malts.
4.0,"This cask-strength whisky is undoubtedly young, but it's hard to tell when sipping it.  The nose reminds me of bourbon right away:  a clear, almost pristine scent of vanilla, gradually joined by spice and laced with honey.  Its flavors, however, are more reminiscent of an unpeated scotch, which makes sense since Indian whisky also is made exclusively from malted barley.  Honey and leafy, earthy tea, along with a healthy hit of spicy heat, define this dram."

3.0,"There's a bit of irony in this one.  At over 60 ABV, you might want to tame it with water or ice.  ( you don't have to, but good luck standing straight after the first few drams).  Yet with ice, there's a real bitter after taste.   I love the taste without ice---smooth, silky and nuanced vanilla.  So-----drunk on the first dram but loving the taste? Or get the bitter after taste but manage to stay sober?"
