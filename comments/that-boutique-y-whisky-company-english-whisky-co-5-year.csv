null,"This review is for the Irish Single Malt No. 1 Batch 2 - 13 Year Old bottled at 48.4% ABV. I was...a bit underwhelmed. The nose is practically nonexistent; there's a little fresh vanilla, chamomile, and coconut oil (I'm assuming American oak/ex-bourbon), but I had to work my nose around in the Glencairn to pick up anything. The palate is better, at least, with vanilla, peaches, and cinnamon...it's a bit like a peach cobbler a la mode. The ending has a bit more spirit burn than I'd expect for a 48% ABV bottling of a 13 year old whiskey; not unbearable, but there's a jaggedness present that I wasn't anticipating. Since this review is not for the actual listed bottling, I'm not entering an official rating, but...3 stars, and a low 3 stars at that."

5.0,"Enough with whisky snobbery folks. This is a timely reminder that 'new world' whisky (from old world England) can be much better than just any old crap rolled out with a Scotch, Kentucky or Japanese location. We tasted at our whisky club, with many a refined palate,  and folks placed the age and pedigree well above what you'd expect. There's a sooty peat here, a complexity that belies the age and terroir and shows technique and qualitycan win out over assumptions. Give it a try, and give English whisky (St George, Lakes, Cotswolds etc) a go."
3.0,"Lovely sweet peat on the nose, stronger on the tongue, sweet spicy. Oranges cinnamon finish."
