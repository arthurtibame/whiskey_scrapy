3.0,"Always curious when new whiskey label appears at the local Total Wine. To my surprise, I was told by the employee that Heaven Hill is actually behind the label which was approved on 12/14/18 by the TTB.
According to Total Wine the mashbill is 70% corn, 20% rye, and 10% malted barley. If that is true then it would mean a completely different mashbill from all the other Heaven Hill whiskeys.
This is really puzzling because that means Heaven Hill distilled using new recipe, aged it at least four years, and is now putting it on the shelves without any fanfare or marketing.
It is a decent bourbon, the nose is similar to Jim Beam which makes sense because of a very similar mashbill (75% corn, 13% rye, and 12% malted barley). Caramel, vanilla, and honey on the nose with more of the same on the palate with charred oak added. Finishes quickly with very little spice and a hint of sweetness. Pleasant and inoffensive but nothing that will wow anyone. Solidly respectable bourbon."
