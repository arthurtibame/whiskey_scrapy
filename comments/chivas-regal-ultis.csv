4.25,"I got to tell you, this new expression is above average and it is very drinkable. The first Blended Malt for the Chivas family, Ultis is a blend from 5 different malts (undisclosed but i bet one is strathisla).

On the nose, Pepper, Orange jam; Starts promising, some Stinky vanilla cream (like Johnnie Walker red label); a little Simple on the nose. Notes of Nuts coming after a sip.

On the palate... Water, at first. Then Spices like clove and pepper. Absolutely smooth. Very fancy. Elegant but not flavorfull. Second sip: caramel. Finish with ginger noges, short but pleasant.

Overall this is a bottle i would buy. My score for this, 89 over 100. Solid."

5.0,I just tried this blend last week and I have to say it's absolutely exquisite. The use of Longmorn whiskey really brings out the creaminess and I found I was wanting more after adding several drops of water. I found myself hoping that the Braeval and Allt'bhainne malts were available to buy as this whisky is really something special.

3.0,Dramfest `18. 1st Dram day two. Not bad for a blend 3.5 but on VFM at  nearly $190 a bottle that's a 3. However having now read the Distiller blurb I now realise I tried 5 of the remaining 20 scottish distilleries I had yet to try in one dram! Sadly I'm only counting it if it's a single malt so still at 20.

4.0,"This is a crowd pleaser and just an amazing blend. Vanilla with ginger and spice and finishes well - nice ! I however still cannot justify the price
