4.75,"The color is a dark amber/gold that costs the glass with oil. The nose is full of baking spices at first that gives way to ripe tropical fruit, vanilla custard, fresh cake and subtle hints of oak, dark chocolate and sea salt.

The finish is medium long with lingering straw, cake and vanilla custard, while fruit, dark chocolate and sea salt slowly fade."
