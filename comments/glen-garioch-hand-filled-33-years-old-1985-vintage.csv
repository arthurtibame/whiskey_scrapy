4.5,"When the Barman of the Hotel in Speyside opened the special cabinet and took out what he said was a rarity, i knew that something very special was about to happen. This is a Glen Garioch 1985, 33 year old bottled in 2018, matured in a sherry butt, where only 199 bottles where made from each cask. 

Its color is Pitch dark. It is like Coca Cola. Bottled at 43.1%abv. BLACK COLOR.

On the nose, dried fruit. Chocolate. Citric notes; prunes. Its like a box of raisins. 

On the palate, it is perfect. Bitter Dark Chocolate; milk powder. Very dry. Raisins. It is so good. 

Aftertaste is also amazing and out of this world. Very old dried fruit, feels like they are about to expire. Ultra sweet raisin flavor. 

Overall this is a delicious very dark dram. There is this feeling of a chocolate madness everywhere. If it weren't for some points deducted on the nose, this would have a perfect score. Still it is an outstanding dram. 95 over 100."
