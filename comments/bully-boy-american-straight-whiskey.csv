2.75,Spicy and has a bite. Taste and smell the oak barrels. Feels kind of heavy but not too sweet like a bourbon. Light caramel

4.0,This whiskey has a light sweetness on the nose with a lot of breadiness. The palate is very similar with the addition of a bit of pepper and bright fruit. Finish is short and a bit toasty. Overall very tasty

5.0,This bottle way exceeded my expectations for a budget bottle.  Went to Boston on vacation and wanted to buy a local whisket.  A smooth and tasty treat that everyone in our group enjoyed.

4.0,"Reminds me more of a Canadian than most American whiskeys - but like a high quality Canadian. 

I get the sweetness of corn followed by the spice of rye. Perhaps it's because I've only acquired bottles of this around Christmas but drinking this makes me think of the holidays and spiced food and sweet caramelly pastries"
