3.25,"I have been working on a bottle of Woodford Reserve and it is a really nice Bourbon for the price. I like the bottle shape since it can go into the narrow spaces of my home bar. I have read many of the reviews of this Bourbon and I agree with many of the views that the flavor of the juice inside is inconsistent. I bought a bottle about 2 years ago and could barely drink it in a mixed drink the charcoal wood flavor was much more than I expected and it was very harsh on the rocks and I ended up giving the bottle away. Recently I saw it on sale and decided to give it another try. This time the charcoal taste was more muted and controlled. I also noticed that the taste was a bit more well rounded. It made a very drinkable Old Fashioned and on the rocks, it was not overly harsh and drinkable. This is a very well-reviewed Bourbon and I will continue to buy it and drink it. However, the flavor profile is not my top choice I prefer David Nicholson Reserve or 1843 or one of the Rye's that I have."
4.5,This is my staple. How I measure up my bourbons.

2.75,null
2.5,"Nose: some oakyness, dark fruits, slight Vanilla
Palate: Creamy, cherry or dark fruits, a slight bitterness on the backend but Still Smooth. Spice and sweet. 
Finish: Dark fruits lingers, some alcohol burn on the way down and that bitterness again, walnuts maybe? Warm spices. 

Thoughts: Decent Bourbon for sure, but nothing i would go out of My way to get. Will happily drink if offered. I prefer This as a mixer if i'm honest, and only for cherry coke which i think it pairs very nicely with. But not worth the Price for a mixer."

4.25,"A very approachable and easy drinking bourbon. I would always accept a glass of Woodford. 

Nose - caramel, brown sugar, slightly sour notes and barrel spice
Taste - marshmallow is the first thing I think off, followed by walnuts with caramel, almost like pralines; some vanilla sweetness and a bit of barrel spice
Finish - pretty thin and fades quickly, caramel sweetness that turns into some light spice, very mild heat"
4.25,"This just jumped into the top spot of my favorite Bourbons, despite my limited track record in the genre. 

The nose is burnt corn, molasses, toffee, and ashy wood. Incredibly balanced between mildly sweet and smoky. 

The front palate is major charred wood; beautiful and ashy. Followed by caramel, vanilla, molasses, freshly cut tobacco. Spicy orange rind and spices.

The finish is leather, oak, licorice root, black tea.  It's a richly dark and ashy finish which I find really satisfying. It leaves a smoky finish that sits dryly upon the back palate."

3.25,"Poured neat. Fruitiness and flowery on the nose with a distinct note of brown sugar. Flavor is a quick, complex eruption of spice, sweet, and smoke that quicky fades as it moves to the back of the tongue, leaving a slightly metallic aftertaste with a faint tingle in the back of the throat. A few drops of water lightens the floral notes, softens the initial punch of the taste, and allows a wood and slightly leathery flavor to surface and linger. Would pair well with a cigar. Note to my future self, I did not enjoy as much on the rocks as the flavors were overly softened."

Palato: basicamente as mesmas notas percebidas no aroma, milho, caramelo, baunilha, apimentado do centeio, dulçor, amadeirado e bem equilibrado. O álcool, assim como no aroma, não é perceptível.

Finalização: média, com milho e dulçor bem evidentes, seguidos de um apimentado moderado.

Impressões gerais: whiskey leve, adocicado, picante e bem equilibrado. Ele entrega no paladar basicamente as mesmas notas notadas no aroma. Muito saboroso e com ótimo preço, pois já é comercializado no Brasil. Ótimo bourbon para que está iniciando, pois não é complexo, possui ótimo preço e é muito bem produzido.

3.5,"Nose: Dark brown sugar and the typical roasted oak notes dominate. Then, there is some caramel, vanilla, light coconut and cheap maraschino cherries. Some light ethanol and floral notes give it a light varnish-like smell (which combined with the burnt notes can be somewhat interpreted as light rubber). 

T: The dark brown sugar dominates the taste with strong oak char notes that end up being molasse-like. A bit less vanilla than in the smell but a deep toffee is also there with some floral notes. Cheap maraschino cherries are still there. There is a light saltiness that combined with the char notes and caramel end up being slightly peanut-y, which I really love. Light ethanol, not as varnish-like as in the smell.

Mouthfeel: Medium to light

Finish: Dry with charred oak, peanuts, orange peel (zest and pith), pepper and cinnamon. Medium in length and is my favorite part of this whisky.

This is a weird one. I try to be objective with my score and I know there are obvious flaws in this whisky, but I do enjoy it quite a bit more than the score might indicate. A great every day sipper."

3.25,"The nose on this is familiar but interesting enough to have you go back for more. Right at the front you get heavy doses of orange, spice and oak, but stay long enough and you’ll find the vanilla and caramels you expect in a bourbon. I do like that they are quite muted for a change.

The taste gives you what the nose already did.. the palate starts off with more citrus, only darker, like burnt orange and sugar.  It then turns quite quickly into spice and heat, tingling the tongue. 

The rich and oily mouthfeel is pleasant, and keeps the finish lasting long.. more heat and ethanol and some bitter notes I can only assume come from the oak.

This tastes much higher then a 90 proof, so if you like orange, spice, and moderate heat in a bourbon with solid legs, this is a great option.

For the price I wouldn’t say this needs to be a staple on the shelf, but when your family says they don’t know what to get you for your birthday or Christmas because you don’t give them ideas and buy anything you want, tell them to get you this super accessible whiskey."

3.5,"(Blind vs Knob Creek)
Before ever doing a review I always thought of Woodford as the quintessential Caramel bourbon.  This didn't change my mind. (and that's good) 
Aroma - Cherry and a touch of chocolate. Light corn and some rose. (perfume) Vanilla & caramel emerge as it opens. 
Flavor is perfume, floral, fruity with berries  Lots of caramel and a touch of pine.  Caramel takes center stage soon.  
Cedar in the finish along with Vanilla & caramel.
3 drops of water were nice. Brought out corn and more luscious caramel. Improves this, makes the finish longer and a note of black pepper.  Not as complex as I enjoy now, but a total pleasure..... Afternoon bourbon on a day off."

3.75,"Decent whiskey. Hits all the notes...

I finally had a pour of this at a local bar. It surprised several of my friends that I had never tried this before. 
On the nose, I get cherries, some chocolate, and a tinge of citrus.
The taste is rich and balanced with allspice, vanilla, and and oak. 

This is a satisfying poor with a nice balance of flavors. I enjoyed the mouthfeel although the finish is quite short. As I try more whiskeys, I find myself enjoying more high-rye bourbons than wheaters. Not sure if this would unseat Wild Turkey 101 as my everyday dram, but this is a solid go-to bourbon."
