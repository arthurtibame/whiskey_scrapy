4.0,"Back in college, I had this one professor of Microbiology, we’ll call him Dr. W.  I dreaded running into him into the restroom.  In fact, if possible, I’d go run across the street to the Engineering building, or simply go to another floor.  You see, he had this rather unusual habit in the restroom.  Yes, most of us consider it hygienic to wash our hands after we do our business at the urinal.  But Dr.W took it to a whole new level of hygiene.  He used to stand there in front of the sink, and wash his schlong right there on the sink.  He lathered it up, put on the soap, and just continued washing.  He then walked over to the dryer, schlong in hand, and dried it under the blower.  All the while, he was having full conversations with me, asking me my opinion on various MicroB topics.  He’d stand there doing his schlong wash and rinse, while asking me “ so, how do you think a retrovirus inserts it’s RNA ?”  What was I to do?  I’m his star student.  Guy is writing me a recommendation for that summer internship in the Chilean Andes researching local flora ( side note: I didn’t give a rat’s ass about Chilean flora.  I just wanted to get drunk and get on with the South American girls ).  Anyway...that was Dr.W.  Fully transparent, showed everything and didn’t give a damn.  

That takes me to this bottle.  These guys apparently ran some podcasts for bourbon and whiskey enthusiasts, and then decided to take their hobby up a notch by sourcing bourbon and bottling it. But...their transparency is all over the bottle.  It lists everything such as where it’s sourced from ( state), years, casks, etc.  All in all, they bottle some really good stuff.  So my pour, courtesy of a business dinner I had last week, was from a 14 year TN whiskey.  It’s Christmas in a bottle.  Nose of sweet plum, brown sugar.  Palette —gingerbread and vanilla.  

Really good stuff, bottled by enthusiasts for enthusiasts, and fully transparent as much as"
