4.0,Quite similar to the double wood but a bit sweeter. As a Balvenie fan I am really enjoying it.
4.5,Sweet and bold.  The classic The Balvenie flavors are amped up with the addition of the toasted Oak.  An excellent addition to their line!
3.75,Nice solid dram with a bit of sweetness and honey.
4.0,Delicious. Smokey with a good bite.

3.25,"This is good, sweet bourbon notes round out that distinct Balvenie malty taste. But even though it’s pitched as a unique finish, it actually tastes pretty standard. A step above the regular line but below the Caribbean finish in my opinion."
4.0,"A good oak nose with hints of vanilla, oak, and a subtle hint of bourbon in this full bodied scotch"

4.25,"The nose starts with fresh oak, barley and vanilla, followed by citrus, almond and brown butter, with an underlying note of fresh bread. The palate of fresh oak and sweet barley, with sweet dough coming in behind it, while citrus and almond give it a very refreshing taste. The finish is medium long with lingering oak, vanilla, bread and barley."
5.0,Absolutely love the toasted oak flavors.  So pronounced at the finish . Delicious

3.5,"Very oak forward that includes layers of honeyed lemon, dried fruits, and freshly baked bread. A slight, spicy burn on the palate is enhanced with a few drops of water so I much prefer this dram neat. Not as good as the 12 year Doublewood, but an interesting dram nonetheless."

4.5,"This year for the holidays I’m going to try a brand new whiskey every day in December. #lifegoals

Dec. 21

When I think about 21, I think about Portwood. When I think about Portwood that’s some heavenly juice. When I think about Heaven, I think about Angel’s (Envy). When I think about Angel’s (Envy), I think about port again. Oops.

Unfortunately, I’ve already tried Portwood, so today I’ll have to settle for this younger brother. It’s wholly new to my pallet, and as a huge fan of Balvenie in general, I’m excited.

Begin political rant.

My whiskey overlord warned me that the next time I buy this bottle, it may cost $20 more. I looked it up, and now I understand. Scotch fans in America are on track to be political casualties in a tariff war with EU. There’s a 25% cost increase on single malt scotches, and it has already been in the books for months. It’s not “if” but “when” it affects each of us locally in the greater distribution cycle. In my area, it’ll filter in with the next reorder. To put this into perspective, it’d be like one day, you’re at your honey hole and you pick up this $70 scotch and take it to the counter. You do a double take when it rings up at $93 after sales tax. So you ask: “Why is the US government making me pay an extra 25% sales tax on my specific purchase? The guy buying Wild Turkey doesn’t have to pay an extra 25% sales tax. This seems arbitrary and mean.” So in that scenario you’re reasonably pissed off, and you should be equally pissed off by this tariff because it’s essentially the same thing. The price jumps up before you get to the register, so it feels different. But the reality is you’re paying 25% more money in a reimbursement chain that ends up in the pocket of the US government every time you want to buy a scotch (assuming the scotch in question continues to distribute to America). It’s a targeted tax, and the taxpayer is the American who likes scotches. Because: politics. Something is wrong with the world when politics alone can make your booze of choice harder to get. Thank original American 8 pound 6 ounce sweet baby Jesus that bourbon can’t be subject to tariffs. For me, anyway.

This concludes my political rant.

The nose is Balvenie standard. Raisin is the main scent here. There’s a bit of peat if I really hunt. Always a pleasure.

Body differs though. I certainly get the raisin from the sherry influence and some peanuts, but there’s some new stuff here. There’s cane sugar, oak, and a hint of citrus.

Finish carries out with the citrus and raisin. There’s a hint of peat, far more than I recall from Doublewood. It’s quite tropical overall.

This is very enjoyable. It sort of hits a sweet spot for me. I’m a bourbon soul who sometimes wants a scotch, and I truly get the first fill American oak influence. Yet, I could see this facing the same problem as Redbreast Lustau. Who would ever reach for this specific bottle, and why? I’m glad I have it, but it won’t beat my bourbons when that’s the craving. It might itch the Balvenie craving for me, but I doubt it would scratch the surface for a true scotch fan. If you too are a bourbon soul who occasionally likes a scotch, this is a must try for you.

‘Tis the season. I don’t know if I actually have 10 more new whiskeys lined up, so if you’re reading this and there’s something readily available out there you’d like me to enjoy/suffer through this holiday season, leave it in the comments."

4.25,"A Scotch engineered for the American palate sounds like it would be too sweet for my taste, but Balvenie had more subtle intentions when it launched this new 12-year-old with the US market in mind. The aromas are delicately sweet and floral, like honeysuckle or a light perfume. Spray a little eau de Balvenie behind the ears and you’ll make lots of fellas happy. Taste wise, it’s buttered toast with a gentle oak spice. The spice ramps up on the long and creamy finish, adding a dash of cinnamon. It’s altogether delicious and much better than the Doublewood - a lovely mix of sugar and spice that I could drink all night."
3.5,"I would get this as an easy to drink, spicy whiskey all on its own. Because it is so spicy it doesn’t taste too sweet to me. But it isn’t very complicated. Maybe a good mixer for a spicy cocktail."
2.5,Taste (spicy) does not match smell (sweet).
3.0,Amazing fruity smell but taste is more on the spicy side. Not a lot of subtle flavors.
4.5,"Smells sweet but tastes a little spicy. Pleasantly warming, not too punchy"
4.25,"Warm, sweet smell. Spicy, slightly sweet taste with a warm, lingering aftertaste."

3.75,This is a nicely balanced and sweet whisky.  On the nose this is butterscotch and vanilla with a very smooth palate and finish.  This is an easy drink for those that like a sweet dram.

4.0,"I Just got into scotch a few weeks ago. This has been one of my favorites. Its rich, oily, and sweet/smooth/fruity. Very mild on the smokiness which I enjoy. Its Probably the bourbon American oak cask aging that speaks to me. I will definitely be drinking/buying again."

4.25,Sweet but not cloyingly so.  Oaky.
3.75,"Light and brisk on the nose. The first sip lacks depth, but the addition of a little water really brings it out. Lemon merengue and toast, with a bit of an oily finish that fades quickly. Best with braised ribs with a blueberry reduction sauce, a side of risotto with peach, and a peanut butter cup for dessert."
3.75,"Move aside Mr. Lightyear because Woody is in the hiz-ouse. This golden dram is full of toasty notes and...and...yup, there it is...marzipan. Drink up my friends.  This Balvenie hits the spot."
