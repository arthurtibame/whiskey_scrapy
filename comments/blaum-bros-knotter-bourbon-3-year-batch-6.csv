3.5,"Ok so this is not the 3yr batch 6, but it is the 4yr Batch 13. Didn’t see one listed, so I’m using this, should be close?

I had heard a lot about the Oldfangled Knotter by these guys but I can’t found it. Then I saw this one, and thought I’d see if it’s decent.

The nose has fresh banana, light oak, plumb, red apple and a touch of rye.

The palate is sweet with rye and vanilla. Not much else going on here.

The finish has a subtle lingering tingling on the tongue, but the flavors disappear fairly quickly. So I’ll say it’s a medium length, short on flavor.

Overall it’s fine. The nose offers a lot more than the palate does. It’s easy to drink, but you’re not going to find anything really interesting while sipping it."
