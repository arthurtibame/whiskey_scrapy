4.25,"Australian Single Malt Whisky Tasting (Part 1), The Oak Barrel, Sydney 16 January 2020, Whisky #5

Nose: Malt, barley sugar, sherry, stone fruits, a shy hint of excellent oak. Caramel emerges as it rests in the glass. A perfectly balanced and complete nose.

Palate: A well balanced malty arrival offset by a tiny sweet brine note. Sweet but not cloying and it coats the palate just long enough to convey a sense of soft richness. The malt character morphs into a rich barley and dark fruit development that in turn progresses into almond fruitcake towards the finish. The texture is like velvet and there is absolutely no heat at all from the 53.5% abv strength.

Finish: Long. Salted caramel cookies.

A very good cask-strength whisky (outturn of 440 bottles) that picked up the Gold Medal and outright Champion trophy at last year's Australian Distilled Spirits Awards, and it's easy to understand why after one taste. This tasting was of bottle 249.

Exceptionally balanced with supurb progression. The profile begins as almost a sherry bomb but through the course of tasting it softens, quietens, gains dryness and develops a sensational salt caramel note on both the nose and palate. Highly satisfying, and for me one of the three standout whiskies of the evening.

Adding water is well worth doing, not because it needs any taming but for the added softness and lightness of palate it creates. An already very good whisky gains elegance and poise that you did not realize could be added and the salty note is very slightly amplified.

I've awarded this one of the highest scores I've given to an Australian whisky so far and I can highly recommend it if you can find a bottle. Sadly the bottle we tasted on the night was the last in stock, otherwise I would have snapped one up.

""Very Good"" : 4.25 stars"
