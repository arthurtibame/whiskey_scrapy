5.0,"I am not a huge fan of the other offerings from Orphan Barrel.  Mostly because of the cost and not taste.  However, the Lost Prohpet is supposed to be from the old Stagg and stored at Stitzel-Weller.  So I was a bit more intrigued.  Was able to get a few bottles at an unheard of price.  Cracked one open for the New Year, and simply put..... wow.
This was amazing.  If you are a fan of Pappy or any of the Buffalo trace products then you have to try and get you hands on a bottle of this.  To me personally it is better then Pappy 15."

5.0,"What an astounding surprise. Admittedly I am quite young in the world of quality bourbon--but am a quick study, I hope.  I am very fond of the Woodford Double Oaked, and have been waiting for the opportunity to try some of the limited-release older bourbons.  I was able to purchase a bottle of Lost Prophet (LP) and Elijah Craig 23.  Rest assured that the Elijah did not disappoint.  It was exactly what I had hoped it would be strong, rich with oak and a wonderful lingering finish.  We did a side but did a side-by-side comparison with LP second.  I could not believe the difference at nearly half the price...LP is surprising more balanced. The front is sweet and creamy smooth. Easy to drink neat. The finish is longer and tells its age, developing into a dry oak smile.  You cannot help but smile when you finish the first sip of this amazing bourbon."

5.0,"At $120 retail, this is almost like a bargain for an ultra-old bourbon.  For 22 years in the barrel, there's just the right amount of oak.  This is a surprisingly balanced whiskey.  I loved the Barterhouse and found that each pour got better the more air got into the bottle.  I can't wait to see what a little breathing time does for this!"
5.0,Great bourbon. Has a nice balance of oak(not overly oaky either for 22 years old) and sweetness. Very well balanced.
4.0,Woody but not nearly as strong as you would suspect for the age. Very nicely balanced overall. Glad I managed to find a bottle but it is a bit overpriced.

5.0,"Mmmm.mmm.mmm.  Smells just like a girl I used to date.  Smooth and spicy and oaky with a hint of vanilla.  Seeing as how I'm fairly new to the rye  scene, I can't make a fair cost anylisis.  But HOT DAMN!!! Get me another!"

4.0,"Nose has hints of apple and vanilla. Tastes has some spice with a little oak and dried fruits, a real sweetness on the first taste that transitions to more spice and a full body. Finish is medium and a bit dry but pleasant. I could sip this for a long time and enjoy it. Really a 4.5 star."

5.0,"The prophet has been found! A spry 22 year old prophet that smells like he has worked all day in a woodshop, and rushed off after work to spend an hour or 2 at the top floor of the university library (and eating some clove drops while studying). This whiskey is best served amungst friends, and you will enjoy it even more if you play some Tom Petty while sipping through your 22 year old dram."

3.0,Hints of astringent come through for me on this but it’s still very very tasty.
4.0,"sweet and has that leathery taste I look for, wish it was easier to find. Might be the best orphan barrel I’ve had. 12/4/17 Columbus, Ohio"

4.75,"Neck. Sample from the Bourbon Junkies. So rich.  The oak comes across like chocolate from a fountain.  Plum.  Leather.  Toffee.  Caramel brittle with chucks of melted marshmallow.  Slight hint of cotton candy.  This is a special nose.

Bit thinner than I was expecting.  While it is lower proof sometimes the oils in these old whiskies can still make it creamy.  Very light and sugary bright on the tongue, surprisingly so. Oh it packs the flavor.  A wonderful cherry note gives way to a blast of vanilla which then transitions to a beautiful oak.  Best part about this oak is that it is not drying overly drying.  Legs linger with that vanilla and oak.  The oak is as creamy as it smelled, once again like a melted milk chocolate fountain spooned straight in my mouth.  I might even describe the whole experience as a cherry cordial.

This is a beautiful pour.  Absolutely gorgeous.  I did a quick head to head with Rhetoric 24, the flavors on the Lost Prophet just crush it.  Rhetoric 24 is delicious on its own but Lost Prophet is more dynamic pour with all the different flavors."

4.5,"So 2020 these are going for at RETAIL 300-330 around here. Insanity?

nose - it's a vanilla baked cookie. It's vanilla extract and some oak. This is on the extreme end of sweet vanilla bourbon with this just PERFECT oak that is sweet and inviting. The one issue is that while 45% can work, it doesn't work at all here. It's freaking insulting and you get it on the nose. Ok it's opened up and now I'm getting bubble gum, red fruits....it's an insane smell but it's also clearly been muted by being grossly and offensively under proofed. 

Taste - A bit dry. I'm getting some of the best bourbon flavors I've ever had. It's a cream and vanilla and just masterclass oak infusions. Everything here is sweet, candied, or this just perfect wood finish that is everything you dream of. But again, it's watery, it's light, it's subtle. 

This is a 5 star bourbon that they watered down but what remains is just masterful. One of the most well crafted bourbons I've ever had and one that could rival the best at a reasonable proof. 

This is crazy but at 45% i'm still going 4.5. This is one of the best bourbons I've ever had.

300 bucks though...I'm not upset with the price, but I'm nowhere close to happy and I don't see myself buying more."
