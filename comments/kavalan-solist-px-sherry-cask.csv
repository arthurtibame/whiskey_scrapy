5.0,"Had a pour of this at a liquor store. Amazing. The nose was very rich with raisins, cream, and nuttiness. It smelled like a fruit ‘n nut bar. On the palate; wow! I’ve read many reviews of whiskies that talk about an explosion of flavour on the palate and I get it now. It felt like a water ballon popped in my mouth. So, juicy and refreshing at first. Sweet berries, leather, creamy, and then this beautiful oak at the very end. Absolutely stunning."

4.5,"Sweet raisiny goodness.
Hot.
Almost has a vegetal taste to it. Borderline hint of licorice root.
The heat is fantastic though.
In my opinion, don't add water and ride out the heat on this. Still stays very sharpe with water."
5.0,"Damn! Best pour I ever tasted. Checks all the boxes for me. Rich, sweet, some spice, heat, great nose-raisins, chocolate, velvety finish with slight fruit juice aftertaste. Wow."
