4.0,"Lite tart apple on the nose. Rich, brown sugar, raspberry, and spice on the palate."
3.5,"One of 511 bottles and another slice of history. Once one of the oldest Scottish sites of distilling in 1772. Unfortunately many owners, bankruptcy, mothballing and then closure in 1996 and finally in 2004 fire soon after being sold to a developer. Got a cost price deal on trying this one. Thank goodness as it was over $30 USD a dram even then. Lovely subtle vanilla, honey, slight nuttiness. 3.5. Nice but not $600USD good."
