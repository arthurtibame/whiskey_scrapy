3.0,"Nose : sweet spicy smoke (reminds me of anejo Tequila) Sip: sweet, chocolate Finish: campfire, and liquorice.   This tast like a smokey Stranahans to me and smells like Tequila.  I am definitely not schooled in single malts or Scotch so I have a hard time placing these flavors. Not a bad drink but can't say I would make this a daily affair. If you want something different from the norm give this a try you won't be sorry. (sample provided by a friend, Thanks Casey)"

4.0,This definitely reminds you of an Islay Scotch with bourbon roots. You have taste of vanilla and tobacco with some peat. I enjoyed it.
3.0,"Maraschino and peach nose, and the flavor adds no surprises. Peach pie, marzipan, plum, toasted marshmallow,hint of cinnamon or clove. Nice linger. Smoke comes out the longer you drink it, but pretty lacking at first. Cherry hookah in a bottle."

4.0,"Took a tour of the distillery today. This is a killer whiskey....well balanced...still tastes a little young to me. I'd like to taste it barreled for a few more years but it's still delicious . The nose is sweet, peach, raisin, banana and plum. The palette is smokey with a distant peat, marshmallow, chocolate, clove and cherry. It finishes warm, smooth, and smokey with a touch of licorice and vanilla. 
  Imagine a sweet Kentucky bourbon had a baby with an islay Scotch!"

4.0,"The smoke is mild, especially on the nose, when compared to some of the peatier scotches, but it develops nicely through the palate and finish. Very smooth with no booze burn at all. Traces of both cherrywood and peat smoke come alongside a woody sweetness and a hint of salt."

4.0,"A novel approach to smoky single malt. The nose is a bit of campfire, caramel, and black pepper. The palate explodes with a burst of smoke and black pepper, then mellows into a buttery, lingering, sweet vanilla and caramel. Subtle it isn't, but that doesn't have to be a bad thing."

3.0,"would give 3.5 if I could--balanced and rich, nothing exceptional, but well done."
4.0,"This one is really interesting, in a good way...

I have a ""ritual"" for every new whiskey (or whisky) I try... Always in a glencairn glass, first neat, then with a little (2 - 6)drops of water, then with an ice cube. This whiskey is a perfect example of how much things can change with small additions to whiskey

Neat - nose =very sweet with the grains taking center stage (almost like cheerios) palate = more of the same, sweet, with the malt really coming through, quite tasty finish = finally getting the smoke I was expecting, but definitely still sweet (guessing that's the hickory)

With 6 drops of water - pretty much the same, but the smoke starts coming through a little more on the palate, but still not on the nose

Single ice cube - wow, huge difference, the smoke(s) really take center stage but without taking away from the grainy malty flavors, just adding to and accenting them

This is easily one of my favorite new drams, not quite a 5,but easily a 4.5 can't wait to visit them for a tour this autumn since my (non whiskey drinking) wife had a thing for distillery tours after our recent visit to Kentucky"

4.0,"While this seems like a gimmick at first glance, this whiskey is definitely in a league of its own. Smokey on the nose, as one would expect, that pairs with a light rubbery note that continues throughout and to the finish. Hints of cherry and apple on the palate as well make this one of my three missing links between Scotch and Whiskey. Well worth the money"

4.0,"Birthday review!  It has a very awesome nose.  Cherries, both black and regular.  Sweet corn, smoke, peat, and vanilla.  Medium mouth coat of a nice spice, hint of black pepper, smoky, vanilla, and toffee on the palate.  It’s like a scotch, bourbon, and rye in one sitting, thankfully without the dill.  Solid performance if you like a sweet buttery long finish too.  4.0. Age could make this more complex, but why bitch."

4.0,"For the price, this is worth every cent. The peat-smoked barley coats the inside of your mouth, giving a tight mouthfeel. The cherry wood is very pronounced in this bottle, overpowering the beechwood in most sips. You'll want to be in the mood for a good cherry taste before sipping this... However, the flavors of honey, malted barley, and caramel make this still very much enjoyable on any given day."
3.5,"The visitor center is burning down, and you're trying to avoid smoke inhalation. Luckily the velociraptors will be struggling with breathing too. Get out of there while they're distracted.

A hefty amount of smoke, throughout the palate. Fortunately it never feels like an overload. It doesn't stay with you for very long, but make sure you give yourself time if you're trying another new whiskey afterwards."
2.0,"Matt and Heidi’s from Nashville, TN. Sampled some before going to dinner. Matt had recently traveled to Nashville."
5.0,Cherry forward on the nose and palatte.  Sweetness from fruits.  Smoke builds on the mouth and in the long finish.  A great daily drinker especially for a Manhattan lover.

It's like the Stooges or Hanoi Rocks of whisky. Awesome, unique, bold, punk, and not afraid to flaunt it. As an ex-smoker I really enjoyed the smoke."

4.0,"Quite unique.  The cherry wood gives it a strong sweet and rounded taste.   The smoke is present, but far less prominent than I expected given the name.  But it's a pleasant smoke, particularly on the finish.  This is probably a young whiskey, but the three barrels round it out so nicely that it has an older demeanor.  I tried this on two consecutive nights, and liked it better on night 2.   I think it's unique enough that i needed a second glance."
4.25,Smokey smooth
2.0,"Nose:  gun oil, sweet, cherry, berries, a little bit of smoke
Palate:  sweet, very smokey, banana taffy, a little bit of malt, floral, a little spicy
Finish:  moderately spicy, smokey (peat and other), gun oil again.

This is a very unique whiskey.  It is complex and interesting, but not very enjoyable.  It is a little like drinking the smells that come to mind when cleaning a gun.  I really like the idea behind it and love that whiskey makers are experimenting and getting creative.  Unfortunately this one is just not my taste."

5.0,It's literally the best parts of every whiskey thrown together. You've got the sweet cherry notes of a bourbon. The spice of a rye. The peaty smoke of a Scotch. A little bit of vanilla cookie of the Irish. I can literally not rave enough about the whiskey. So much so that I decided to make it my first pour on my birthday! Great smoky cherry notes on the nose and an even greater fruity taste that lingers into a smoke-filled finish. God bless Corsair Distillery

You can really smell the peat and BBQ smoke that Corsair advertises in the Triple Smoke name, but comparing it to an Ardbeg really brings out the sweetness. The taste still has that beautiful cherry and orange note with that beautiful peat that reminds me of the great Scottish isles"

5.0,"Well, ladies and gentlemen, I've found my favorite whiskey. An awesome medicinal cherry (Think Luden's cough drops) on the nose with some beautiful smoke flowing around it welcomes you to the Triple Smoke experience. Corsair has become a constant stop for me whenever I visit Nashville, exclusively because of this whiskey. Even those who stray away from smoke should try this whiskey because all that smoke is offset by these beautiful fruity notes that result in an amazingly sweet whiskey with an awesome peaty finish. I tried it with a bit of water tonight and it opened up so much more, providing more of that smoke and fruit and almost a bit of BBQ sauce."

4.25,Great smokey aroma. Smoke and dark cherry. Rich and really smooth. Faint peat flavor.
5.0,The nose is like enjoying a cherry-orange popsicle by a bonfire. Beautiful sweet notes with a punch of smoke behind it. The taste starts with those lovely sweet notes that finishes into a pure Islay scotch experience thanks to the peat
