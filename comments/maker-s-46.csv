3.0,"BACKGROUND: When it was originally released in 2010, Maker’s 46 was the first new expression developed and sold by Maker’s Mark in 50 years, and because the company was famous for sticking to the traditional and not upending the marketplace, it created a bit of a splash (no pun intended).

In 2008, Bill Samuels, Jr., the son of the brand’s founder, decided it was time to develop a new line, and he assigned the task to Master Distiller Kevin Smith.  The assignment included some specific instructions from Samuels, which included:

The new whisky had to be sweeter than the current Maker’s Mark and contain distinct caramel notes. 

It would have a toasty wood aroma. 

The finished product needed a lingering, rather than a crisp, flavor. 

It couldn’t have any sour notes, especially the bitter flavors in the back of the throat that drinkers might get from other brands. 

After much experimentation, the Maker’s 46 formula and process was decided upon.

The bourbon begins as regular Maker’s Mark distillate, but after its normal period of aging, it is placed in a second standard barrel containing ten French oak staves and aged in a temperature-controlled limestone cave for an additional period.  

This oak staves are first aged nine to 12 months, up to three months longer than the normal length of time for standard barrel wood, in order to remove bitter tannins, and they are toasted rather than charred, which results in specific flavors. 

NOSE: The nose carries a strong scents of cherry cordial and fresh-baked bread.  Caramel is present, as well.  It is a pleasant nose, and one that finds me lingering over the glencairn to enjoy it before every sip.

PALATE: The strong cherry presence in the nose manifests upon the palate, as well, but it is joined by a nice chocolate toffee flavor.  Some maple syrup, oak, and a bit of spice are present, as well.

FINISH: The long and warming finish is dominated by oak, but contrary to Bill Samuels Jr.’s instructions, it offers deeply bitter and unpleasant tannins. 

FINAL ASSESSMENT: The nose shines the most, by far, in this bourbon, but the palate is also pleasant.  The bitterness on the finish, however, becomes more pronounced with each sip and takes away some of the enjoyment.

Honestly, I discovered this bottle in the back of my bourbon cabinet and had completely forgotten that I even owned it, but that pretty much sums up my thoughts about this bourbon.  It is not great, and it is not bad.  It is just simply average and, in a word, “forgettable.”"
4.5,"Hard to beat this at the price point.  Delicious neat or on ice ball.
Well rounded, woodsy and sweet and almost completely devoid of any harshness."

4.25,"This is actually a very good bourbon. 47%abv,  a much better expression than the original Maker's Mark. Very mellowed and easy to drink even if it is 47%abv. Beautiful red color.

It is called Maker's 46 because the story of this dram goes, allegedly, like this: after making the normal ""Maker's Mark"", they take some barrels apart and add some diferent french oak stakes to the barrel giving it a flavor enhancement, and they came to that recipe after 46 attempts.... it actually works like a charm.

On the nose, typical bourbon notes, very pleasant: Vainilla ice cream, Banana, Cinnamon and Maple syrup.

On the palate, caramel, Herbal liquorice, Allspice, Vanilla. Very Mellowed, very easy, lovely really.

Clove or allspice aftertaste, medium long.

This fine bourbon deserves a 88 over 100 and for the price, i say you should grab a bottle. Cheers!"

3.75,"This is a wheated bourbon, so the sweetness makes itself known on arrival.  Brown sugar developing into vanilla, then hints of butterscotch.  The oak doesn't make an appearance until the second sip, and it slowly gains traction from a malt-like mid-palate to a dry finish.  Subsequent nosing reflects the initial palate.  Adding water rounds out the sweetness, reminding me of vanilla ice cream.  This is when I start smacking my lips to accommodate and enjoy the finish.  Good work.

3.75,"I feel like I’m have a Goldilocks moment here. I’ll drink the original Makers any day, but it can come across a bit thin. On the flip side, the Makers CS was too much for me to handle, time and air did t open it up, and I ended up gifting it to a friend. This seems to be filling that “just right” bucket for me. On the nose......

A lovely nose to ponder. Brown sugar, butter, cinnamon...like a softer version of Wild Turkey but no less full bodied. It enters the palate gently, with a burst of spice on the mid palate, and then its smooth as butter going down. That mid-palate is important. That’s what I’m missing in the classic Makers, and that’s the clear influence of the French Oak (a lesson won by spending all last year getting to know a bottle of Compass Box Spice Tree). The finish is subtle but lingers. A gentle reminder of what you just drank, like a liquid cinnamon bun. 

A worth purchase. I was looking for a bourbon to get me through the summer, and this will do ever so nicely. At $30, it’s a great price too. I like the wheaters, bit I don’t really want to shell out for Weller, and this fits the bill well. Cheers!"
3.75,Another very nice bourbon for the price point
4.25,"A fuller, spicier version of the standard Maker’s Mark, and for me that’s a good thing.  The overall impression is a fluffy honey-wheat bagel.  Shows cinnamon and a little caramel on the nose, backed by Bit-O-Honey and Wheaties on the palate.  It’s somehow focused and round at the same time, and it complicates things with some minerality on a medium-length finish.  I love this at the price."
