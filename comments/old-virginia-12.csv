3.0,"Bottled in France at 43% from American new oak barrels it offers a little more than the standard budget bourbon. For the modest price (for a 12yo) I imagine many people use it as a mixer but it is quite pleasant neat. Finding the right water ratio is tricky, the nose opens with water but it drowns the taste. At this price why not pour two glasses and have both.

Nose:
Lemon candy
Buttered Dill
Green Banana skin
Vanilla
Fresh oak

Arrival:
Apple juice sweetness 
Vegetal tang
Wood char

Development:
Quinine 
Tangy tannins
Cinnamon
Orange peel 

Finish:
Wood spice
Dried banana chips
Soft menthol

A fancy bottle and an elaborate plastic twist top lid gives a “half way there” vibe that translates (in a perhaps unintended way) what should be expected from the contents. A tasty bourbon that is smooth enough to not offend you drinking it neat. Sweet enough but not cloying and spicy enough to be savoured without the solvent notes that sometimes come with this price tag."
