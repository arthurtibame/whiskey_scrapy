3.75,There’s an appealing floral nose floating above the smoke of this reasonably priced remix from Kilchoman. The taste starts sweet and tart before a vibrant pepper kicks in. It’s very different from the core range and interesting enough to warrant further exploration. Thanks for the sample @jonwilkinson7309!

3.75,"Very sweet citrus port smell. Nice taste port and oak at first with a flowing of peaty and tobacco taste. Nice complex taste of smoky, toffee, oaky and port."
3.5,Light sweet and tobacco notes. Peaty taste on the palate with light smokey tones in the background and a tobacco aftertaste.
4.0,Well balanced. A little richer than many of their other releases with pleasant chocolate undertone.
