4.0,"Surprisingly good.  Very smooth. Forget all the noise from your average whiskey drinkers talking about the Apple notes and all that.  You get the fruit, sure, but it doesn't linger in an annoyingly sweet way on the lips.  It's got all the right flavors for what it is, a 40$ bottle of very decent bourbon.  Perfect for those that are looking to explore out from ""starter bourbons"" to something with a bit more depth.  Ditto the review mentioning the bottle.  Looks great on my bottle cart!"

4.0,Better than expected. I got a hint of sour fading into a raisin brown sugar on the nose. Slammed up front with big sweetness morphing into a spicy oak finish. Not unhappy that I bought this.

3.0,"Apple pie a la mode in bourbon form...but, in a good way, not a cloyingly sweet way. Baked apples, vanilla, spices, and buttery pastry on the nose...well, and on the palate, too. You're getting what you're promised. There's a peach note at the end, too, so if you're more into cobbler, you can go that route. It's a little hot and young tasting, which doesn't have to be a bad thing, but it does harsh the mellow, eating-pie-in-Mema's-kitchen vibe a bit more than I'd like. Then again, my Mema back in Texas was drinking (and making pecan pie with) Weller's before it was a trendy luxury brand...so maybe a little boozy burn is just par for the course at her house. Not a half bad little dram."

2.0,"Surprised by all the positive reviews. Not terrible spirit, but - even at its cheap price, not worth it. Smells fairly good. Flavor seems pretty young. I get some burnt caramel, which I don’t love. Overall, not my favorite. Won’t buy again. Buy Evan Williams Single Barrel (or Eagle Rare 10 or Woodford Reserve) at this price point."
4.0,I’m not going to bore everyone with what “notes” I️ tasted. I’ll simply say this is a damn tasty bourbon with a pleasant finish. Can’t go wrong with a bottle of this in your collection. You’ll find yourself going back to it again and again. Enjoy!

2.0,"$39.99 @ TW.
Classic Bourbon flavor profile. Vanilla, and brown sugar throughout. Fairly smooth, but at 92 proof that is to be expected. If this bourbon was priced closer to $20 it would be more in line as this really is no better than Buffalo Trace. It's well behind, 4 Roses SB, Elijah Craig SB or Eagle Rare. In short, pass on this one"

Being the past printer and design guy, to be honest with you, the label drew me into this is 5 yr aged whiskey is from Kentucky. 
I tried this neat and the notes speak to that, I added 6 cubes ice and this help things out greatly... more flavor, more complex, less burn.  This is a good beverage for a mixer on a cool night by a fire!  CHEERS!!!"

My first impression was that it has almost no nose. On the tongue a unique bite on the front. Lingers in the middle, low heat, light wood and some cherry. The finish is short and unmemorable.
