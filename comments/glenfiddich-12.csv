4.25,"Probably the best overall value in this style and price. It's  rich and velvety with a wonderful maturity and depth. It's like the rich Uncle of Glenlivet, and the mature version of Glenmorangie. 

There is much more pronounced oak character here than you get in most other scotches. If you're coming from bourbon, it's a taste you'll find familiar and if you're coming from a peated malt, the smoke notes will be a reminder. 

In the price to yum ratio, this is as good as they get."

3.25,"The nose has a lot of malt and pear.

The pear notes follow through on the palate- tastes like pear skin and pear flesh right under the skin.  It's got kinda of a bitter herb flavor in the finish with a sharp, woodiness that isn't my favorite.  As far as entry level single malts go among the great ""Glens"" in this price range, I think my preference Glenmorangie 10 followed by Glenlivet 12 followed by Glenfiddich 12.  It's not a bad drink, but the aftertaste is not my favorite.  Granted, I'd take a Laphroaig or Highland Park any day of the week over these, but unfortunately you can't buy Laphroaig or Highland Park in 1.75L, so it's nice to have a decent, ""bulk"" single malt."

3.0,"O primeiro Single Malt a ser provado para a maioria e um eterno contendor com o JW 12 Black Label o qual, apesar de ser Blended, acaba sempre por ser comparado com o Glenfiddich 12.

Oferecido no Natal e, confesso que já não o bebia há uns tempos, quis apressar-me a abrir este Single Malt para as massas.
Deixo-o respirar e sinto madeiras, óleos essenciais e pouco mais.
Na boca, o aspecto oleoso vem mais ao de cima, mais intenso que as madeiras, talvez um pouco verde (apesar de confessar que possa ser indução da garrafa e caixa).

Para terminar...
Continuo a achar que o Glenfiddich, sendo um Whisky comercial como todos os das maiores casas com tudo o que isso implica, não deixa de se apresentar diferente quando comparado com um Blended equivalente, nomeadamente o JW 12 Black Label (o meu Blended padrão para testes), e assim dar a apresentar que há (muitas) nuances dentro dos Whiskys desde que haja vontade para se explorar.

Que há bastante melhor que se consegue comprar à volta dos 30? Há!
Que me incomoda de ter este na minha cómoda para ir saboreando (ou usando para assar umas chouriças)? Não!
Que é um Whisky porreiro para quando não queres beber (abrir) nada de maior valor (porque não tens motivos para isso que o justifiquem)? Sem a menor dúvida! Especialmente quando a tua condição económica te permite aventurar em alguns Whiskys estratosféricos, mas não numa relação assim tão habitual."

In following sips, the bourbon cask influence is apparent - balancing out the sherry influence and nullifying the sulfur element.  Decent mouthfeel for a low ABV.  Pleasant and not forgettable, as it has a balanced flavor profile that a Macallan 12 Sherry Oak Cask lacks.  And it's $30 cheaper.

4.0,"Last time I checked, Glenfiddich 12 was the number one single malt in the world. Maybe it's been surpassed, but I doubt it. As for me, I think this has been my #1 purchase over the years. This was one of my gateway Scotches, and has always been one of the better options for under $50. This is the old packaging (not the one pictured). Let's check it out.

Nose: Fruity and floral. Green apple, pear, apricot, strawberry, nectarine, lemon, and raisin. A true fruit bomb. Definitely some green, grassy notes. Creamy custard, vanilla frosting, honey, graham cracker, toffee, roasted peanuts, almonds, and chestnut. Baking spices and oak. Solid nose.

Palate: A bit more sherry influence than the nose. Some plum and cola in addition to the raisin from before. Still some apple, pear, apricot, and lemon. Not quite as fruity as before. The bourbon barrel also shows up in the form of caramel and vanilla. Some honey, toffee, and malt. Walnut and almond. Oak and char. Once again, very nice.

Finish: Despite being 40% ABV, this one stretches to a medium length finish. The apple and pear are still there, as well as the lemon citrus. A touch of cinnamon, black pepper, and some other baking spices.

I might get some heat for this one, but I'm giving this a 4.0. Perhaps it's sentimentalism or maybe it's just good VFM. Either way, I really like this one. Great VFM, enough flavor to please.

Over the past few years, the price on this has risen a buck every 6-12 months. I used to get this for $43, now I get it for $48. And this is before tariffs warp the pricing. With that being said, VFM heavily impacts my reviews, and this is one of my favorites sub-$50. Highly recommended to any beginner. Great whisky to have on hand for guests. And substantially better than the other ""Glen 12"" that sits at this price point. Cheers!"

3.75,"Very nice scotch, not much hear. The first taste almost reminded me of a hint of green apples, then a definite woodsy spice flavor. Not much of a lasting aftertaste, does come off as a tad sweet and apple like again."

4.25,"Allegedly the best selling single malt in the world, this is a fine whisky for a 12yo, a little fruity and straightforward, but for the price it is really a good deal (around $33).

Bottled 40%abv, with a burnished color. 

On the nose it is very fruity, specially full of apple notes as Sider and apple juice. There are also cream and cinnamon on the aroma as well.

On the palate at first is a little harsh, but you will easily be able to tame it in the second sip. Tobbacco, honey, oranges and a herbal note. The finish is long with a clove spicy note with lots of character. 

Overall i give this dram an 88 over a 100. Cheers!"

3.5,"The nose is sherry, and a touch of sulphury vegetable stuff, broccoli. Mild ribbon candy. Briny salt. More heat than I would have expected since it's only 40% on the nose.

The cask Sherry cask comes through in the first taste. The burn is palpable, even with a droplet. Apple skins. Buttery. Cherry juice.

The finish is strong alcohol. No smoke but plenty of heat. Dark, bitter Stone fruits: plum, prune. The heat of the alcohol never relents."

3.25,"Easy drinker. it is quite innocent on the tongue, I get some light floral notes. It does not last too long on the pallet

Colour: Pale and translucent through. Light yellow tint. Pale wheat field on a bright day.

Notes: Grain, Dried fruit, Apple tree, 

Palate: Smooth to the tongue,  easy runway for the taste to build on the tongue. 

I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a balanced first single malt. In comparison to the 18, it has a quick finish"

2.75,"blind tasted next to cardhu 12.
very light nose. apples, pear, lime. hints of orange. vanilla dominates.
light on the palate with more fresh fruit. spices (clove or cinnamon?) but not harsh. hints of chocolate and fresh cut grass. pretty sweet. Overal pretty smooth but on the weaker side. 
short finish with a bit of sherry cask coming through. decent whisky for a hot day, but this would not be a good sipper for me. 
a few drops of water totally destroys this whisky."

3.5,"The nose on this whisky instantly reminds you of all the great speycide scotches you’ve had before. Fruity and bright on the front, rolling into a warm
malty hug before you take your first sip.

The palate immediately transports you to grandmas house for breakfast, delivering notes of brown sugar, oatmeal and cinnamon.

The finish is short and sweet, but just before it’s gone it gives you a warm, spicy, oak barrel kiss to say goodbye.

Super approachable, classic flavours, and like it’s Glenlivet cousin down the street, this is a great whisky to keep on hand or to introduce someone new to scotch."

4.25,"Nose: Gentle. Slightly spiced. A little butterscotch as well. Very pleasant.

Palate: Spice coming through with some cinnamon as well. Oak fused with malt flavor as well. Sorry if that’s a little silly but this is just a very subtle dram!

Finish: As gentle as expected based on the nose and the palate. Nice and easy but goes quickly. Almost calming in a way. Could easily knock back two and head to bed.

Overall Thoughts: Excellent stuff. I adore mostly all Glenfiddich to begin with but this has been a favorite of mine for a while. I will always recommend this one."
