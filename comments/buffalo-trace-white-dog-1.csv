4.25,"Sweet Buttered Corn, Black Pepper, Bread, Oily & Sour."
3.25,"No aroma, strong after taste"
3.75,"Surprisingly sweet, with corn taste and a yeast/bread finish. Not something I would drink every day but very interesting. I plan to experiment with mixing into some cocktails too."
2.5,It’s basically moonshine.  Heavy corn flavor heavy burn. Makes you glad for aging in charred oak barrels!

3.75,Bright Buttery popcorn nose. Rich sweet fatty corn taste then the the spiced 125 proof. Ends quickly with a linger of the corn
0.75,"Glencairn, neat, rested none
Nose: buttered popcorn, caramel
Palate: cream corn, butter, figs, yeast, and rye grain
Finish: medium long rye spice hug all surrounded by wet straw

Overall: Bad, but a lot of fun to drink next to eagle rare and see how this mash can evolve."
3.0,This is definitely not a 2.6 overall at all. Nice cheesy popcorn nose and a buttered popcorn taste with a slight spice finish. The people that give this a crappy score just aren't used to drinking higher percentage whiskey or whiskey in general.
2.5,"This new make is clear as water and has thick watery legs.

The nose is crisp and sour overall with notes of creamed corn, plum, yeasty bread, and Fruit Roll-Ups.

The palate has notes of baked vegetables, tart raspberry, and grass stalks.

The finish is spicy and long.

Cheers!"

3.0,"I had this stashed in my bar for two years until I figured out what to do with it. It doesn't taste very friendly (overly cloying, with rubbing alcohol notes and too much corn) but it mixes to perfection if you find the right approach. (Hint: lemon, simple, crushed peaches, strain. Peach and corn whiskey are perfect together.)"

2.0,And now for something completely different!  Not bad but not great. Must appreciate the upfront corn.
2.0,"I mostly got this because I'm considering making whisky and felt I should know what the preaged stuff should taste like so I'd know when I got to the hearts during distillation. 

I wanted to like this, but I couldn't get past the rubbing alcohol element and the burn. Sweet with corn, and then rubbing alchohol followed by burn. Finish is short and is mostly rubbing alcohol, but post rubbing alcohol a slight fruitiness remains(I got honeydew melon). 

Tried adding an ice cube just to see what it'd do. Cooled the burn, but the same flavors remained; just muted and rubbing alcohol was still present. I imagine this could be good mixed, but not something I enjoyed as a sipper."

On the pallet, the mash is velvety with a pleasant burn from the alcohol.  It tastes of sweet corn and malted barley."

0.25,"""0-1.5: Disgusting. Worth only mixing or meeting the drain. 
2: Bad. Drinkable, but majorly flawed 
2.5: Sub-par. OK, but bland or somewhat flawed. 
3: Good. Decent stuff, but I won’t be rushing to buy it 
3.5: Very good. I’d love to keep a bottle around
4: Excellent. I would like to own a case. A go to for me that is worthy of celebrating 
4.5: Incredible.Truly high end, elite level, very noteworthy
5: Sublime. Nearly perfect and an all time favorite"""

2.0,"For what it is, surprisingly not as harsh as expected. 125 proof hits the nose with a quick ethanol smack quickly changing to a very sweet smell, somewhere between candy and bread.  The taste is heavily dominated by corn with a little bit of grain.  Smooth mouthfeel and finish though a quick and spicy finish at the end"
