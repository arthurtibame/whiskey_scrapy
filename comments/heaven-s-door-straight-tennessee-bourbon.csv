2.75,Hints of cherry and bark with a warm start and relatively smooth finish.  Many friends recommended but a bit of bite to me.  Slightly more general whiskey flavor than bourbon.

3.0,"Color:
Very light amber. 

Nose:
Lemon zest, vanilla, pine, touch of gran mariner. Pretty light.

Taste:
Cherry syrup. Slight heat. Orange zest. Raspberries. Oily mouth feel. Toffee. 

Finish: 
Surprisingly long finish. Caramel. Clove spice. Toffee. Slightly raisiny.

Verdict: 
This is based on first tasting. I just opened this stuff. I usually wait, but excitement won out. All in all, it’s not bad. There are plenty of bottles I’d rather have at this price point, but for what is in all likelihood a one time, novelty buy, it leaves me pleasantly surprised. I think it definitely has the potential to open up. The nose is really light and underwhelming. I like the body of it. The finish here is where it’s at, and honestly drinks like it’s closer to 8-10 years, not 6 1/2. Some of the toffee and berry notes remind me of Four Roses Small Batch, though it certainly doesn’t achieve the full complexity of that bottle."

4.0,A pretty solid offering! I get the typical vanilla/spice notes but also pick up a bread/dough flavor about 3/4 way through. Definitely worth the money and I would buy this again.

4.0,Smooth. Vanilla. Nice oak on back end. A great bourbon
5.0,"Vanilla and toasted grain on the nose, with vanilla again on the palate this time accompanied by a mild spice. Te finish is almost identical to that of Maker’s Mark, an appealing earthy funk. Overall, this is absolutely delicious and a great addition to any collection."

2.75,"Lighter colored bourbon - appears quite young. The nose pops with alcohol and spices, cinnamon and cloves.

In the mouth it is more earthy than expected. Spices are still present while alcohol is more subdued. Expands quickly in the mouth, and unfortunately also fades quickly. Faint whiskey flavor lingers.

Glad I tried it, but probably won't buy another. Going on the tasting shelf for others to try. Better than a mixer, but not a regular or special occasion sipper."

3.5,I get some of the butternutscotch and vanilla but man this is nutty! Like peanut nutty in smell and taste. Did not get that on the first try but once trying a few other bourbons and coming back to this.... nuttiness

4.25,"A 70% corn, 20% rye and (10% ?) Tennessee mash bill with small grains aged for (almost) 7 years in American oak barrels. Heaven’s Door is a partnership with Bob Dylan and Angel’s Envy’s CEO, first released in May 2018.  They are moving the distillery in a former church (circa 1871) at 5th and Elm in SoBro as they continue to try to gentrify the area near the Nashville bus station.  There is a lot of marketing in this bourbon, from Bob Dylan’s name to the artwork from his Black Buffalo Ironworks studio.
Heaven’s Door bourbon has a spicy nose with a full butterscotch palate.  The higher rye content makes it a bit spicy, but the Lincoln County process adds a smoothness to accompany the warm spices and vanilla."

4.0,Smooth and rich. Vanilla and maple syrup (maybe more brown sugar). Finishes with the vanilla oak. I like it.
3.5,Nice vanilla flavor with just the right amount of spice. I really like the char flavor that comes through. Normally enjoy my whiskey on the rocks but drank this one neat. Would definitely try another pour.
3.25,Nice balance of sweet vanilla and char. Liked it better with ice. Taste lingered in mouth
4.0,Nice and light oak with Vanilla sweet followed by a delayed spice finish. This is one of my keepers.
4.25,"Corn and rye battle it out on the nose, with the corn eventually winning and adding some vanilla, sweet corn, caramel and vanilla on the smooth palate, the medium finish is warming with the corn and vanilla making another round."
3.25,Floral and slightly sweet. Finishes well. i enjoyed the slight burn that lingers. I would have this one again.
4.25,Smooth with just a little bite - Vanilla notes come through

3.25,"Color: Nice strong bronze

Aroma: Faint toffee/cinnamon, not overpowering

Mouth Feel: Crisp, thin, surprisingly smooth for a fainter mouth feel

Flavor: Slight honey, a little bit of mint, I get the vanilla that everyone has been saying but I thought that profile would be more up front

Finish: Short and smooth but taking a breath in 30 seconds later will give you a surprising touch of spice

Overall: Almost a two stage drink...starts like a lighter bourbon but finishes like a rye. Slightly confusing profile but a quality pour especially for the price. There seems to be a lack of oak for my liking but getting past that it’s a solid bourbon. Wouldn’t regret buying another bottle but wouldn’t go out of my way."

4.0,"Being fairly new to bourbon, quite honestly this is the best I have had so far. I enjoy whiskey from local sources for the feeling of supporting my hometown. However, it's hard to compare the relatively immature whiskey locally to something as smooth as mature as this whiskey. 

To the untrained palette, this is a very complex flavor profile. Reading the ""professional"" reviews makes me believe people are just making up flavors to describe it. I do agree with most of them in the fact that I highly recommend it as an evening sipping beverage. I find that two large ice cubes really wake up the flavor and chill it enough to make it enjoyable because of the flavor and the contrasting temperature on the tongue."

3.75,"Cedar and spice. Chart says lots of vanilla, but I honestly don't sense that much. Not to mention, it's seems salty to me and the chart shows this lower on the scale. (hmm, I'm sensing this differently than the profile for sure) A touch gritty, but still decent"

4.25,"This one is spicy, I suspect a high rye count in the mash. You can get the charcoal that almost makes it smoky. Lacks the sweetness I expect from a ""bourbon"". It's a Bob Dylan whiskey, I mean that alone gives it enough credit that you gotta try it. Would buy again, solid whiskey."
