4.0,"The aroma is mostly heather honey, pollen, cream soda, and powdered malt. A palate full of milk chocolate, subtle sweet peat bricks, vanilla and malt ball finish. If you chew on you'll find a little chimney smoke. A hedonistic dram, one that calls for The Doors Alabama song (whisky bar). While it's not the pinnacle of complexity it calls for many more pours. ""Oh show me the way to the next whisky bar, oh don't ask why, oh don't ask why..."""

3.5,"Hmm I haven't had a great run with ancnoc so far, 18 and Blas haven't floated my boat and now this. It's got potential with sherry, vanilla, toffee, bitter cacao, slight dry fruit vegetal type flavour. I like it...but the alcohol just isn't in balance..its a drying ethanol impact. Water didn't really seem to help. All in all 3.5 - 3.75 but it could have been much better if the 2nd b in bbc (body, balance, complexity) held up. Wouldn't buy a bottle."

2.75,"Poured this with a good friend who's a bourbon drinker - heck bourbon employee. We both like it, weren't blown away, and he found the nose offensive. Now that it's been opened for a while and I've let a pour breath a bit lets see. 

Nose - Fruity, earthy, waxy, minerally. This is hard to explain. There's a sweet note in the malt but I'm not getting to the barrel finishing. There's a certain old oak funk note here that's really making everything else hard to get to. Drop of water and ok a bit more fruits, the bottle says Christmas spices...i'd more go with baking but ok. I don't get any of the honey they claim. 

Taste - Ok this is a complex dram. Here I get figs and raisins and honey and spices, and leather and oak.  It lingers with the California raisins singing to me from an oak platform. A lingering dusty oak/leather note. 

Really tastes great but the nose is off, maybe even off putting for some. This is a bottle I'll savor over the next few years. This is one to have and ponder. It isn't however a master piece or even really that special. If these notes are you, get one but I wouldn't chase it or really feel it is needed.  2.5 because the finish has a complexity I love and I might be giving it credit for the price to age. Also the color is crazy nice and it's natural! 

post neck pour

OK the sherry is taking over this one on the nose and the taste. The spices are still there but they I guess don't bother me as much. I'm moving this to a 2.75. There's still a spice bite and I don't get OLD whisky despite 22 years."
4.25,"It’s sweet and spicy. Sort of like a combination of Clynelish and Dalmore, with their fig, dark fruit, and oaky characters, then adds a dash of chili oil to it. I would say it’s quite an uniquely enjoyable whiskey."
4.25,"Fruitcake on the nose, sweet and silky on the tongue. Not as long a finish as I expected but delicious nonetheless."

4.5,Lovely nose. Full and warm. Hints of heat but full pleasant finish. Cinnamon buns and sherry. Excellent.
