5.0,"This is probably my favourite whisky this year. The balance between sweet caramel and light fruit with oak spice and a hint of smoke is near perfect. The nose is a little more toffee and caramel, but the palate brings out some rye spice and strong oak flavours. The finish is long and has a bit of citrus that comes along with the oak bitterness and lingering sweetness. I liked this when I first tried it, but as I move through the bottle this has become a wonder (edited)"

4.0,"un whisky riche, caramel, vanille et pain grillé.
une finale soutenue jusqu'à la fin. Elle était sur la fin quand nous l'avons goûté et les saveurs était superbe. Dur à imaginé les saveurs quand elle était neuve. Un très beau moment."

5.0,"Super smooth, zero burn.  It's like surprising well rounded, kinda hits every note.  Nothing stands out big time, just a great palate.  Little more smoke on the finish, but it's mild and blends perfectly with the spice."
