4.0,"Spicy and peppery favors are slightly subdued by the oily and rich accents that immediately follow, but continue thru the finish. The fullness that comes with higher rye content is impressive. This is a top “available” mid-priced bourbon IMO."

1.0,"Sweet, hot and harsh at the same time. Over the top florals, yet finishes like acid. Even some water couldn't smooth it out a bit. Can't stand this one."

2.25,"Color: Glazed donut
Mouthfeel: Smooth, creamy yet thin
Legs: short/medium legs, lower proof
Nose: Honey, fried apples and stone fruit, particularly cherry. Some baking spice essence
Palate: Almost no alcohol. Caramel, cherry, vanilla that quickly fades into oak spiced heavy whipping cream 
Finish: Finish is medium in length, from fruit quickly into cream then oak before falling flat
Overall Impression: Overall I enjoyed this. Easy drinking with enough going on to keep it interesting

Rating: 5.5"

4.25,"Excellent bourbon for the money. I've used the 8-year in two different blind bourbon tastings, pairing it against bourbons far more expensive (including Weller 12-year and Old Rip Van Winkle 10), and it's come out in the top-two both times. Easy win for the money. This isn't my favorite sipping whiskey, but it's a real crowd pleaser if you can find it."

4.0,"Look:  Dark orange, slight alcohol legs, and translucent.

Nose: Fairly sweet smells, with a mix of some baking spices. Fruit forward I’d say. 

Palate: Cinnamon, black pepper up front, underlying sweetness with caramel mid palate, followed by a more spice dominated finish.

Finish: Dry, and fairly hot. I get a bready note in the finish, as well as plenty of spice. Later in the finish, some grape peel comes up. 

Overall: A fairly good bourbon, relative simple, but easy to drink. Little bit of heat, but perhaps that’s from some rust if not drinking whiskey for a while."
