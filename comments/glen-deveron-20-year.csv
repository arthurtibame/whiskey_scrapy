3.0,I rate this 8/10. It's a weaker version of the 30. Flavors are short with a long oak finish. Smooth.

2.75,"Smooth and decent, but not a whole lot of interesting flavor going on for the price."
3.0,"It’s very smooth, one dimensional flavor. It’s very good, but not complex flavor. Expected more from a 20 yr but it was worth it for the price."
3.5,Like kix cereal for patient adults

3.0,pretty smooth but a lasting sharpness in the finish.  A little smokier than I like.
3.75,"The nose (vanilla) and palate (fruity) are pretty good, quality price speaking. But then the finale lacks of complexity and is a bit harsh. For the price you get a 20 year-old, it is worth it but don't expect too much because of its age."

3.0,
2.0,"Glen Deveron 20 year old – Royal Burgh Collection
Color – Amber
Nose w/o water – Raisins, stewed fruit, grapes. Wine. Subtle. Some cereal.
Palate w/o water – light. Watery almost. More raisin, light fruit flavor.
Nose w/ water – opens up quite a bit, a bit more character. Red fruits, strawberries, raspberries?
Palate w/ water – still light, cereal, fruity. 
Finish – short. Kind of disappointing for a 20 year old."
5.0,Loved it

4.0,"Warm caramel and dried fruit. Fruit cale, vanilla, charred oak and pepper. Finish is moderate with waves of brine."
4.0,"A very good whisky, very balanced without been anything too special. 

Bottled at 40%abv with an amontillado sherry color.

On the nose, coffee, brown sugar, chocolate, toasted caramel, sherry notes and grapes.

On the palate, it is hot but not that much, notes of spice, lots of oak, ginger and peper, with a short-medium liquorice finish.

Overall i give this one an 88 over 100, nice but a little boring on the palate."
