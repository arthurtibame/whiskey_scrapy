4.0,"So sweet, so cherry cinnamon... then so HOT. 

This little firecracker will fool you on the first sip until she drags you into a back room and gives you what-for on the swallow. You won’t regret getting burned in the end, either."

4.0,"This one surprised me. Sagamore has yet again created a wonderful variation of thier rye whiskey. This may be a bit sweeter than some rye purists would prefer. It smells a bit sweet and is very easy to sip neat. The rye sting is late and subtle but in a good way. I will be keeping a bottle in my rotation. Cheers!

P - Baking spices, grapes, berries

4.5,"This is quite nice. You can taste that it’s 50%, but still easy to drink without water. Nice finish of sherry and caramel"
