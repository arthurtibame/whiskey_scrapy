3.75,"Buonissimo al naso, molto legnoso, in bocca é diverso non rispecchia il naso, si ammorbidisce ma cresce di gusto aumente notevolmente di intensità fino a quasi l'astringenza Molto interessante!"
3.25,"An inviting, warm color in the glass, this young Glenrothes smells like butterscotch candies, heather honey, sweet barley, and honey crisp apples. The taste is on par with the nose, and in addition to more heather honey, a cherry twizzler note comes across. The malt comes across as oatmeal-like, and dried herbs like savory and marjoram accompany it. The finish is light, pleasant, and melt-in-your-mouth, and the aftertaste is sweet. This is a simple, though not simplistic, whisky, and having had a bottle of the more mature vintage releases, you can see what it’s aiming for. At $34 a bottle it makes for a better-than-usual everyday sipper."
3.25,"Starts sweet, a bit of sour covers it up, and some spice to it for my novice tongue. Works for me!"

3.0,Light pear smell whisky of speyside. No buden to enjoy that anytime
3.75,Light texture and smoothy
3.75,"Butterscotch, malt, lemon zest are the main things I get. The finish is a LOT like a Werther’s Original. Not a bad little malt, definitely friendly and enjoyable. Won’t present a challenge, just a nice easy drinker."

3.5,"Nose - sweet and light, vanilla, butterscotch, lemon zest and a touch of coconut
Taste - butter and honey, with a touch of spice, not very complex but very enjoyable
Finish - thin and light, some lemony tag at the end, hotter than you expect for 80 proof"

3.0,Voor 40 procent een mooi mondgevoel lekker rijk. Makkelijke whiskey maar merk niet veel van volledige sherryrijping. Goede instapwhiskey.

1.0,"Bro, save your money. This bottle is good for shooting, and by that I mean shooting target... I mean, it’s much better than Jack Daniels, but if you’re the kind to mix it with Coke (in which case, not sure why you gave this app), then this bottle is for you.. as is JD. 
Tasting notes: diluted.. watery.. flat.. good for shots, and I’m being generous."
3.75,"Fruity, light and soft. Enjoyable dram. Wish it had a bit of bolder body."
4.25,"I haven't had a bad Glenrothes. But to prove my point, i went young. Maybe the youngest Glenrothes (idk) and i had a glass of this 10yo expression. The nose on this one is spectacular. It is a very easy enjoyable dram and for $40, it can be declared as an everyday whisky.

Bottled at 40%abv.

On the nose: Vanilla soooooooo lovely. 
Roasted coffee. A dim sherriness coming through. Caramel beatiful. Dulce de leche
A hidden fig sonewhere. Actually remarkable.

On the palate is way too straightforward and normal. Vanilla and a little plum, but mostly it feels watery. 

Aftertaste is nice, it has a slight smoky note; tobacco and dry grass. 

Overall, if this were a little better in the palate, it would be amazing. Still it is a good dram, 83 over 100."

3.25,"Nice, light, sweet little sipper with a smooth finish."
3.5,"I popped into my local bottle store for a beer and before I knew it I was tasting the new GR range. In summary it's better than their earlier official OBs but that wasn't hard as they were terrible! This I think I liked the most maybe because it's rare that on a school holiday day looking after the kids i get to imbibe in the morning. The kids got a bag of potatoe crisps each and headed back to the car to eat them whilst i made my way through the GR range. Nice simple well priced $40USD drop. Vanilla, lemon etc."
