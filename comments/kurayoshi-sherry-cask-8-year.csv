4.0,"A great drop, but almost overpowering sweetness. Rich honey, verging on syrup. Secondary notes of stewed and fermenting citrus, like nectarine. Follows through at the end, with a slight tartness."

5.0,Very good stuff. Has lots of red berry and brandy influence from sherry casks and goes down smooth.

4.0,"Nose: Hmm.. Unlike Macallan or Glendronach, the nosing is quite light for the ABV at 50%. Open up with floral, plum and dates after few minutes breathing. 
Palate: Fruity with some caramel. Light in sweetness. Easily lingering around the mouth. Bot too strong so just nice. Hint of dark choco at the ending with some bitterness. 
Finishing: Medium with hint of sherry all the way.

Conclusion: Not bad for me. I got it at around 5000 yen. Good for budget dramming. Will bottleshare some to those who never tryout yet."

4.0,"Very complex on the nose. Reminds me of an Irish smell but not in the taste. Almost could swear it had notes of unmalted barley like Irish. 

Fruity and heavily sherried just as advertised. 

Chocolate and has a bit of a bite."

1.75,I tried it again against my other Japanese and Kavalan sherried whiskies and it's easily my least favorite.  I'm just gonna use this bottle for mixed drinks where the sherry will be masked.
5.0,"Let sit for about a minute.

👀 Pure pale Golden goodness, semi-robust legs;

👃 Very sweet like smelling a fruit basket, Vanilla, hint of smoke;

👅 Pure SWEETNESS, lots of fresh fruit, oily;

🏁 Lingers on with sweetness, beautiful finish, typical Japanese whisky."

2.75,"Sweet vanilla on the nose with noticeable alcohol. The taste has wood notes with a heavier alcohol amoretto taste. The finish is mild and spicy. Not bad, but not memorable."
3.75,Very sweet and fruity. Lots of fruit on this. A little burn but enjoyable. Medium finish. Comes off a little too sweet after a while
