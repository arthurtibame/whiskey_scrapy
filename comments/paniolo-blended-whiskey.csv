3.0,Sweet like a rum.  Island feeling  whiskey for the non-whiskey drinker.  It is good when cut with soda water and served on a lanai.

3.0,"Hali'imaile Distilling Company is very upfront and transparent that they source the base spirit for their Paniolo Blended Whiskey. What they do not divulge is how much percentage of their neutral spirit is added. This neutral spirit is the reason why the word ""blended"" is on the label. Neutral spirit can be distilled from any source such as potato skins, sugar, grape, or in this instance: pineapple. Whiskey can only be distilled from grain.
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) requires minimum 20% straight whiskey with the rest being neutral spirit to be present in the ""blended whiskey"" category.
The distillery specializes in distilling vodka from pineapple and does it using a pretty unique set up with glass stills that look like they belong in a science lab. They actually bought Maui Gold pineapple farm and brand!
In Paniolo Blended Whiskey, what you get is a Heaven Hill 3 year bourbon (confirmed by the person running the tasting room) with a bit of neutral spirit distilled from pineapple. After blending it is aged another 3 years. On the nose you get the familiar almost nutty, cinnamon brown sugar notes found in Evan Williams. The palate has vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, and some charred oak. Finishes quickly with black pepper and slight sweetness.
Everytime I visit Maui in particular, the everyday troubles and the hectic pace of life seems to dissipate. Worry is replaced with peace and relaxation.
Paniolo Blended Whiskey is a perfect companion in paradise: flavorful enough to enjoy and not too complex to where you have to overthink it."
2.0,Young. Harsh and spicy. Requires an ice cube...or two. I'm a fan of smooth but if you like a bite go ahead and try.

2.0,"Nose: smells like what it is: corn, pineapple and sugar, but lacks complexity. 

Palate: mostly corn on the palate, little to no spice in the first sip, but a little builds through the dram, pineapple again (meh)

Finish: flabby and sweet. The warm hug surprises though"
