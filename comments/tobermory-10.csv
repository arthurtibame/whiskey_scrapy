3.0,"Tasted 11/1/2014 Portly Villager :  Nose is sweet, cereal and spice.  Creamy texture on the palate. Honey sweetness  eventually works its way in, but fades quickly to dry oak. Long spicy finish (black pepper). Not a bad dram. Warms the soul on a cool, damp day (like today)."

4.0,"Nose: Sugared barley with oak and spicy notes. Very fresh nose! Some ginger and dryness with toast.

Taste: Sweet with honey. Nicely sharp with dried fruits, oak and peppery tones.

Finish: Nice and long with mild spices and dry notes. Malt and herbs are strong.

Balance: Refreshing dram, dry and crispy but not too sharp and stingy. Great whisky indeed!"

4.0,"The dram is straw-like gold in its appearance and its nose is similarly light in tone — poignantly tart pear is the first emphatic aroma, followed by salt and rich maltiness; as it continues to lift hibiscus comes to mind; the palate presents salted butter, spiced muesli, dried seaweed, and hints of caramel; the pleasant burn comes rather quickly to enhance the flavors, while the finish boasts old oak; the next inhale is like the chilly air of an ancient forest; further in, the bourbon influence makes itself known subtly but elegantly with sweet smokiness. Floral and malty aftertaste. Less remarkable than its Ledaig cousin, but contentedly unrefined, wild, and still altogether splendid. Thanks for sharing, Alex."

But it's really the creamy ending that bursts onto the tongue at the long and complex whisky that really sticks out the most."

3.5,"Once known as 'cheapest of the cheap' among Scotch drinkers, the quality of this Cinderella malt has improved significantly over the past years. Hailing from the Isle of Mull, Tobermory 10 features a lovely marine quality. On the nose, you get light, crisp and floral notes with butterscotch, sour berries and anise sweetness lingering in the background. The taste is zesty, peppery dry and rather astringent in the development. Along with its medium-length, malty and chocolaty bitter finish, this Single Malt has a real personality that will not suit every palate.

3.0,"I want to start off by saying that this is a re-review.  I first reviewed this spirit about a year ago, and I'm not sure that I gave it it's due.  I wouldn't say that I had a bad bottle by any means, but I do think that I'm better prepared to review this one today than I was back then.

The Bottle: Squatter than most, with a nice green glass and a thin band of a paper label.  Very similar to my remarks about the 15 year old, which only differs in color and proportion; but all of the relevant details hold the same.  Tobermory consistently produces some of my favorite bottling designs across their range.  The label calls out that it's un-chill filtered, but doesn't say anything about a natural color.  I tend to think that it is, given the color of the spirit itself but it's hard to be sure.  This Is a classy one that looks quite nice in any bar.

In the Glass: A few shades darker than an Ardbeg.  It has a straw color to it, but with a touch of apple juice.

On the Nose: This is where you start to realize that Tobermory puts together a spirit unlink most others.  There's a a powerful dry note to this with a marine backdrop.  It's got an herbal quality to it, as if ""Sea Sage"" were a thing.  A touch of green apple woven in there as well to round it out.  Being the only active distillery on the Isle of Mull really gives these guys a chance to put their mark on the single malt map.  It's not really ""like"" other ones that I've come across.

Taste: This is interesting.  Picture a marriage between Calvados, citrus, rubbed sage and the smell of a cold water beach.  It's an odd mix, but it actually works quite well on the tongue.  Aside from some of the apple hints, this isn't a sweet whisky; this is a savory one.  The dry sage and herbal qualities in this allow it to play the role of an aperitif or something to go really well with a meal.  I wouldn't reach for this as a dessert dram, like I would so many others.  The finish turns astringent and drying, which makes you want to reach for another sip shortly after your last one.

All-in-all, a really nice whisky from an often-overlooked distillery.  It's started to become more difficult to find out by me, which is a pity.
I've grown very fond of it the second time around and I very much look forward to the newer 12 year old offering(s) that Tobermory is working on.  I likewise reviewed a bottle of the 15 year-old, and I can definitely see how this spirit provides the foundation for that one."

Fresh apple skins (mostly green apples), lemon, and slight strawberry. Wine Gums and a bit of mint (spearmint?). Taste is coastal and fruity--candied lemons, saltwater, pepper and chili. A bit of sourness--like sour fruits. Something indistinctly floral. Oily, waxy texture. Some dry wood. Finish is short and dominated by lemon, green apples, floral notes, and not super-well-integrated wood. Not a bad whisky, nor is it a great whisky. It'll do on this cold evening."

The nose and palate are herbal, like a backyard garden, with the tongue occasionally experiencing a touch of lemon. The finish is a little short and leaves wanting. Overall a fairly-balanced whiskey, and certainly delicious for the affordable price."

4.0,"This is worth tracking down, especially if you're a fan of coastal/Island whiskies. The nose is complex and quite savory - herbs, a floral note, grass, lemon, salty sea air, a bit of dark baking chocolate. The palate is as delightfully complex as the nose - the herbs and grass lead the way, followed by a tight ribbon of citrus and salt that runs down the center of the flavor profile, with some light vanilla sweetness and dry, crumbly dark chocolate at the end. The mouthfeel is rich and a bit oily. A real humdinger, especially for the fairly reasonable price tag."

4.0,"Tobermory is a close cousin of Ledaig 10.  Or, perhaps to put it more accurately, Tobermory is heir to the throne, bearing the name of the distillery itself, while Ledaig 10 is the cousin and second-in-line.  The distinction between the two is that Tobermory's malt is unpeated, although its flavor profile purportedly picks up some peat influence because the spring water used actually flows over peat bogs.  To be honest, I was hard-pressed to detect that here, but what is apparent is that this is a high-quality single malt.  The nose features a slightly oily aroma, green apple, and toffee, and those flavors are joined on the palate by a rich, chewy, pure cereal grain note that is much more pronounced and cleaner than in your typical 10-year single malt.  The finish is also cereal and oat-flavored, and makes for a satisfying conclusion to this one.  For $50-60, you could do a lot worse."

4.0,"Color: The color for this Scottish island delight is a very light honey gold. The legs are thin but viscous.

Nose: The nose hit my nasal cavity with a light alcohol burn, but after acclimating, notes of green grass and hay bales stand way out in front. Honey, baking spices, soaked wood, and honeycrisp apple notes fill out the rest of the amazing bouquet.

Taste: The palate contains notes of sea salt, fruits, honey, oaky tannins, malt and dark chocolate. It’s really quite delicious though maybe a little complex.

Finish: The finish is medium long in length. The aftertaste is salty, bitter, and almost creamy like a stout beer 

Thoughts: This scotch was so delicious, vibrant, and full! It had an uncanny resemblance to a stout beer in my opinion, and as that is one of my favorite styles of beer, I really enjoyed it! I think a splash of water brings it down to the perfect level according to my preferences. I would definitely buy this one again, and highly recommend it! Sláinte!"

4.0,"Nose: Gristy, grassy and fresh with citrus overtones. A very cereal-driven nose with a bracing medicinal herbal touch. There's also an oily maritime quality to it that I find very attractive and a hint of smoke, but so fleeting as to be just a flight of fancy.
        
Palate: A sweet and tingly spice arrival. It's lightly creamy in character but also crisp and clean. The development is slow and measured, gradually building up flavours of sweet-and-sour citrus, brine, licorice, barley sugar, ginger and peat (not smoke, peat). It has a pleasant texture that is slightly oily but dry.  As it rests in the glass it becomes more and more salty.
        
Finish: Medium/long with minty, maritime cereal flavours that have an almost anaesthetic quality that must come from an interaction with wood tannin. This fades to a refined sweetness that lasts and lasts.
        
This is a most interesting and elegant malt with great finesse. I've been meaning to get around to tasting it for some time and I'm not disappointed. It's a subtle one that conveys many impressions.

It's maritime, but not the sledgehammer bonfire on the beach sort, nor the blanketing sooty fog rolling in from the Atlantic.  It's much more a quiet stroll by yourself on a deserted shingle beach on a cold, cloudy day - oyster shells crunching underfoot, chill surf hissing on the stones and curlews crying in the distance. A most evocative frisson of a whisky - lovely, austerely complex and gentle, like a Hitchcock blonde.
        
""Very Good"" : 4 stars"
4.25,"Well well what do we have here? An unpeated island whisky you say? Tell me more?

If you’re a fan of the Bunna 12 or The Classic Laddie, you’ll like this one. Creamy malt with a hint of sour citrus zest and a little bit of salt. I’m almost tempted to make a margarita with this dram. 

Where this one really shines is the finish. The proof helps the finish linger for so long; long enough that you never want it to end. You know. The way you used to wish Game of Thrones wouldn’t end. But I digress...

Bit hard to find this pour. I can find it’s peated brother, Ledaig, easily enough, but folks must not be lining up for an unpeated islander as much. Shame. This is a quality drop. Keep an eye out for it. I got this one in a 50 ml sample bottle. Trying to work through my samples by years end so I can focus on my open bottles. Stay tuned for my 20 for 20 year of reviews. Cheers!"
3.0,"This one, I would describe as steady. Kinda like the Redbreast 12 is consistent in its palate all the way through, no highs or lows, this guy is the same concept. Honey and fresh herb on the nose, think basil or cilantro in terms of the freshness, but not their specific flavors. On the palate, citrus jumps out right away, and mixed with the fresh greens, kinda reminds me of the freshness of an IPA. It’s different than other scotches I’ve tried from other regions. I like it, but the fresh herbs and citrus is its only trick. The finish is quick. It intrigued me to find other good island scotches, like Jura or Talisker."

Bottled at 46.3% with a pale staw color.

On the nose is lovely, Instant great aroma. Brown wedding cake, vanilla cream very appealing, prunes, Nutmeg and fresh pear. 

On the palate is a cheap whisky. That is the best description i can give. Thick, hot, young oak and almonds. Ginger aftertaste very boring.

Overall i give this dram a 68 over 100, and if it werent for the good nose it has, score could have been a lot lower."
