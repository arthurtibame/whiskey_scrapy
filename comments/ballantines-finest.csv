Easy on the pallet with a short to medium spice finish. If you're looking for everyday drinking whiskey. I believe that this is the most reliable, affordable and enjoyable blended scotch on the market. It's cheap but drinkable."

3.0,I'm pleasantly surprised by this budget blended scotch.  I don't detect any smoke but there's a subtle fruitiness on the palate (pears?) that soon gives way to sweet chocolate notes.  The finish is dry and there's almost a salty tang at the very end.  Not bad for $30 a Liter.

3.0,"First of all this is very cheap so don't expect much. But compared to other blends I think it's definitely got its merits. Nose: very sweet, it's not like a sherry sweetness but like a very sweet cereal malty sweetness with a bit of sharp alcohol grain. Palate: very smooth, all the flavours are very composed, a buttery fruity, grain, slightly smokey taste. Finish is short it's smooth but it's got a bit of bite going down. Okay so for the price, it's not too bad I don't know why people are complaining it's so bad, yes it's not as good as my highland park 18 or glendronach 1995 px but those are $150 a bottle. This is less than 20 bucks and for making a scotch and soda or you just wanna save some money and drink something cheap this is actually a very sensible blend. I'm giving it 3 stars, mean it's good and since is cheap it will be a repeat buy from me."

2.25,"Ballantine's Finest is a young, low-priced Blended Scotch that has a reasonable quality and is certainly drinkable on its own. One of the lead malts in this blend is Auchentoshan, giving Ballantine's a light, sweet and floral character. The nose is quite grainy with nuts, honey and maple syrup. Although it tastes fairly rough and immature, there is a pleasant burned sugar sweetness with a good amount of sherry cask influence. The finish is quick, vague and definitely lacking intrinsic quality. Not a spectacular but honest blend which works well as a mixer.

3.0,"Nose: floral - hints of lavender and cedar. Rather light, but with a slight pepperiness and a touch of iodine. Mango perhaps? A whiff of caramelized brown sugar that's been scrubbed with rubbing alcohol.

Palette: A shockingly full body for a scotch under $20. Though not very complex, definitely high marks here for busting my expectations. Most blends I've had at this price point are thin and watery... not this dram. 

Vanilla and honey sit on the tip of the tongue, before charging to the back of the mouth with abandon, unleashing a peppery barrage that burns so good. A slight pine rises in the back of the pepper, offering a hint of respite in the midst of the fire. 

With a splash of water, the sweetness is unlocked more, and it becomes an even more pleasant dram as the peppery burn is balanced by fresh, sweet cherries and sugarcane.

Finish: undoubtedly a weak point. A touch bitter, slightly medicinal, and tasting of unflavored mouthwash. This overall unpleasantness finally resolves into a nice brine aftertaste, that fades relatively slow.

The bottom line: A full bodied sub-$20 whisky. If you don't go in expecting much, it's sure to surprise you. An honest blend that is passable neat, but perhaps better suited with a splash of soda. 

I think it will have a home on my bottom shelf as my low price, go to daily sipping scotch."

3.0,"i always think it is important to rank like against like.  to my mind, there is little point in searching for tasting experiences in ballentine's finest.  it is an introductory level blend, and it does this job very well.  affordable and good in a mixed drink when you're not trying to be fancy as all get out.  and i'm not dismissive of blends - some of my most wonderful whisky experiences have been had with masterful blends, both neat and mixed.  but this is just a solid little operator; a good bottle to put at the front of your cabinet in case some guest with almost no whisky knowledge should arrive with a bottle of cola before you get there.  it's not a degustation menu worth discussion - its a solid asian noodle house and i go there often."

So if you like highland park 12, not a total snob and on a budget this can hold back those cravings and save some cash"

2.5,"Nose: Light - initially cereal with some maltiness. A slight ethanol aroma from the grain whisky. Vanilla emerges after a while and becomes the dominent aroma.

Palate: The arrival has a hot burn, not a spicy burn, just hot. There is a definite barley sugar taste and some lemon becomes detectable in the development, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it ""fruity"" or ""citrus"". Definitely some vanilla sweetness but I didn't detect any smoke or peat - I feel that anything resembling that is more likely a tannic character imparted by old refill casks.

Finish: Short, with a little residual bitterness.

It's not a particularly interesting whisky, but at the price point you wouldn't expect it to be. It's a consistent, light, workhorse blend that does what it does quite well and is perfectly acceptable.

A dash of water brings out a little sweetness on the palate. As a mixer it adds a slightly sweet, cereal, vanilla and fruity background. Not too bad on the whole, considering the price point, but it is up against some stiff competition.

Luckily, on the palate alcohol gets a little aside, bringing out vanilla, still amaretto, dried fruit and candied orange. All very sweet and also difficult to discern, in a profile that is (and wants to be, that's clear) superficial and drinkable. Moreover, even when drunk, the alcoholic irritability of the nose infiltrates the already precarious balance of taste.
Very short, evanescent finish, an imprint of sweet alcohol like a cheap cake."

Neat - Orange zest and cardboard are the dominant notes with secondary floral elements (Roses). 

PALATE:
Neat - Matches the nose. Candied citrus with the bitterness of the peel. Not much else going on. A fine tipple in a pinch or if you’ve lost your job and need a cheap Scotch that won’t make you cringe.  

CONCLUSION:
Reminds me of a cocktail waitress I used to shag in my 20’s. Uncomplicated but pleasant to put my face in.

2.75,"Almost nothing on the nose. Not
much happening on the initial taste, either. It’s light and thin in the mouth. Warm honey lingers afterward. Dewars White Label and The Famous Grouse are better choices for a similar price point."

3.75,"One of my favourite “bottom shelf” blended scotches. It’s very pleasant and easy to drink but has enough complexity if you want to imagine little flavours popping up you can. I often get a little smokiness at first, and just a little sweetness, leather, old books, a bit of vanilla and milk chocolate. Overall very good for the price."

2.5,It's great whisky because you can enjoy this level with quite affordable price
2.0,"Nose: very weak, hard to perceive. Not very inviting, not displeasing either. Some vanilla, maybe chocolate.

Taste: drinkable, soft, simple, sweet, perhaps a hint of faint smoke. Light watery on the mouth, not much texture and not spicy. 

Finish: ultra short, not memorable, leaves almost no aftertaste.

Value: found it on sale for about $8 USD. Unremarkable dram but good value for the money. Probably will not buy again."
