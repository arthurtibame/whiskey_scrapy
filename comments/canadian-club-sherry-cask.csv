2.0,Not specifically memorable. A decent product in the CC lineup. Seems more like the marketing department came up with the product than the distiller team.

3.0,Light bodied and sweet
1.0,"Appearance: Thicker semi-watery legs dribbled down the glass of this Canadian sherry bomb. It also had the dark color of baked snack pretzels.

Nose: The nose had notes of waxy roasted pecans made at Christmastime, overripe apple, cinnamon, maple syrup, baking spice, moss, and a mild grainy harshness.

Taste: The palate was way too sweet for my tastes with notes of vanilla, caramel, maple syrup, honey roasted peanuts, and some barrel spice attempting to balance it out.

Finish: The finish was a swift initial burn at the back of the throat that eventually mellowed, then plum skins and vanilla took over for the remainder of the moderate amount of time.

Thoughts: Well for those who keep track, batch c12-232 of this “small batch” may be good for some but I, for one, can’t get behind it. It was a definite sherry bomb, very syrupy and sweet. It also had a burning that was more intense than usual that I attribute to a less than well-made whisky. I thought this product from CC would be good but I personally enjoy their flagship much better, and do not recommend! Sorry Canadian Club, but I was not impressed."
2.0,More rye and less sweet. Almost seems like it's trying to be a bourbon. notes of vanilla and almond with a spicy note of rye. Aroma of sherry and caramel.

3.0,A little sweet. Nice bite but loses it on ice. Flavours disapears quickly but when they are there it is nice.
