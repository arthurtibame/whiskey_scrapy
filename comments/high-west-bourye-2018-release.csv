This is a solid and interesting release from the fabulous High West. Upon entry you have Vanilla, burnt brown sugar and caramel. Mid pallette features rye and baking spices with a long finish featuring more of the same and some very balanced oak. Pretty nice viscosity. Only real question is it worth the steep mark-up on some of their other products? In a word yes! From a pure value standpoint I would buy Rendezvous or Midwinter, however, this is unique enough to warrant the purchase."

There's some good rye spice right up front. It's silky smooth. Cinnamon and maple round it all out. Damn good."

4.25,"I tried this at Whiskyfest SF but I'd had a few already.  Pretty sure I liked it but...here's a sober taste.

Nose:  Presents as very sweet with a traditional high rye bourbon nose of vanilla, dark caramelized sugars, and very heavy apple.  As I get more of the nose I start to get some lightly herbal rye notes and a little bit of fresh baked sourdough.

Flavor: More vanilla and dark sugars with quite a bit of oak from all of those age stated whiskeys that were blended in.  Some grassy rye notes and a little bit of toasted peanuts in the background.  Presents as what it is: a blend of rye and bourbon.

Finish:  Medium long, gets pretty herbal with quite a bit of mint and black pepper.  Some rye spice but not as much as I'd expect.  A little drying oaky note towards the very end.

Overall this is a nice whiskey with the herbal notes from the rye offset nicely by the sweet nutty ones from the bourbon.  Comes across a lot like a Maryland style rye (usually around 51% rye and heavy corn) like Sagamore but the high age does wonders for the complexity and dark sugar notes."

4.0,"A generous taste courtesy of Pie Chef Guy.

I'm going to start by saying I really like this.

The nose is quite decadent with notes of vanilla custard, nutty tapioca and just a touch cardboard (and I mean that in a good way, kind of like the smell of a pizza box without the pizza).

The taste is just amazing. It's very smooth and reminds me of a blackberry cheesecake with an undertone of oak. The finish is brief, consisting of a sweet berry-like fall off."

4.0,"Greensboro Buyers Club tasting via @ridethalightin.  This blend is nothing short of incredible.  Way too expensive, but great none the less.   Great bourbon flavor and great rye notes.  It is different than just a high rye bourbon.  It is really better than the sum of it's parts IMO.  Try it at a bar, or like I did... borrow a pour."
