4.5,"Nose is fruity and elegant, hints of toffee and dried fruits
Palate is complex with intense sherry notes, ripe fruits, toffee, sultanas, very discreet chocolate note, with a dry and quick mouth feel, lots of oak
Finish is very long, dry and fruity and dry wood (oak)"
4.5,"Just reminds me an awful lot of the 21-year-old fine oak, but at a fraction of the price. Lovely Sherry notes along with some lovely fruits, cannot endorse enough."

4.25,A well rounded dram with apricots and a touch of coffee on the nose. Rich honey vanilla with sherry hints in the background. The finish is long with a tad of spice. I sampled it on a Caribbean cruise and was told it is a duty free product only at this time.

4.25,"Macallan has its ways. They all have the Macallan aroma with slight changes. They all taste good enough. This one, part of their newest collection, ""the quest collection"" is no exception. If you are a Macallan Fan you will truly enjoy it, if you are not, (like me) you will also enjoy it as any other macallan, which i always say is the only distiller whose whiskies never have a score lower than 85 over 100.

Bottled at 43.8%abv, sunset orange color (website definition lol)

On the nose: its a macallan. I believe i could recognize the aroma in a blind tasting without even trying. Sherry, oak, candied fruits, christmas cake, raisins, cinnamon, cola and clove. Just incredible. 

On the palate it doesn't match the ""amazingness"" of its aroma. Liquorice, oak, almonds, nutmeg, some sherry. Finish is medium with hints of cinnamon. 

Overall this nice dram deserves what most macallans deserve, an 89 over 100 score."
