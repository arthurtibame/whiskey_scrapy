5.0,"Great and smooth texture. You can. certainly  taste the remnants of the ash content. Overall, a great buy."
4.0,"Time in the sherry cask is evident. Vanilla and a touch of peat most prominent, but many other flavors present as well. Making space on the top shelf."

4.25,"Poit Dhubh is a vatted malt from Prában na Linne company on the Isle of Skye.  I first had a taste at their stand at WhiskeyLive Dublin last year and liked it enough to track down a sample.  It is non-chilfiltered (though with colour added) and is reputedly comprised of several Island whiskeys.  

This has a gorgeous sherried smell, with a waft of gentle, muted peat. To earn my pocket money, one of my chores after school was to light our solid-fuel range oven.  As well as kindling I used factory-compacted peat briquettes that I split with an axe.  That's the light peat 'boladh' in this whiskey that carried me back a few decades. 
 
The taste is smooth and sweet, with zante currants as the most noticeable flavour. A touch of water opened up a hint of sulphur and dark cherry on the nose and some orange on the palate.  The finish is wonderfully long with lingering light peat smoke and burnt marmalade.

Overall, I thought it was rounded and smooth - more sherried than peated but very well balanced.  Slightly higher than 4 stars IMO - probably a 4.25. Heck, let's call it an even 4.33333333333333."

4.0,"On the nose it's heavy with cherry, some vanilla and chocolate. No surprise on the taste, same as the nose plus a bit of peat/smoke. I also get a very similar aftertaste to Lagavulin 16, just not as strong. I still haven't figured out what it reminds me of, but I love this aftertaste. This, combined with the fact that the peat note is turned down quite a bit makes this whisky far more enjoyable for me. It still isn't a ""reading a book and sipping"" whisky, but for exploring a complex dram this works rather well. The price is also rather low for a 21 year old whisky, so if you can get it, definatly try it."

4.5,"Cherry, chocolate and sweet on the nose. Incredibly smooth. The more you sip the more the vanilla comes through. The peat is light and more of an aftertaste. 

A touch of water opens up the nose but loses the peat. 

All in all an incredible drink with a unique mix of sweet and peat."
