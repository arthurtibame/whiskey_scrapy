5.0,"An almost perplexing blend from Balvenie.  You get the very distinct toffee and citrus flavor.  There is quite a bit going on within the whisky, but it is definitely a high quality drink"

4.5,"I've had this one for almost 10 months, and I finally decided to taste it.  Without going into tedious details, Tun 1509 Batch 1 is a very good whisky. It is complex and nuanced, both nosing and on the palate. No strong flavors jump out; rather, it's a unique and well balanced gentle harmony of many flavors, sip after sip.  Amanda's review here on Distiller called it ""delicate"" and I can agree with that.

I think Balvenie has done a fine marketing job ratcheting up the anticipation of this limited annual release. As good as it is, for me it's overpriced. No regrets buying it, though I don't think I'll try to buy any subsequent releases. This bottle will last quite a while, and I'll enjoy each sip."

Palate: apples, nutmeg, cinnamon, a lovely spice 

One of the best whiskies I've ever had. Cannot wait to buy a bottle to enjoy for years."
