4.25,"Almonds and licorice greet the nose, accompanied by a clear cereal and biscuit component. Dried apricots, orange zest, Williams pears and the fruity side is served. In the background, a slight peaty impression. Beautiful debut, sweet and mineral, the winds on the Breton sea did a good job.
And the peat sensation is amplified on the palate, mineral and smoky, flanking and thickening the flavor of the whisky, with still licorice and dried fruit, orange, chocolate, cereals. Spicy and peppery touch. Three-dimensional, young but not too much.
Fairly long finish of ash, hazelnuts, cereals, with salt and pepper on the lips.
I admit it, I had approached this whisky with few expectations and it really surprised me: not at all banal, full, fun, multifaceted. Being the business card of their whiskeys, this Armorik makes you want to try all the others!"

1.0,"I bought a mini bottle of this and it left a bad impression on me, I was scared away from French whisky for a while. it's bitter, young, unbalanced, cheap, shard, with a rough burn... I tried this at a time were I was more tolerant to sharp whiskys with burns, god only knows how I'd feel tasting it now... I'd pay to try better offerings from Armorik like Sherry Cask and Double Maturation, but you'd have to pay me a lot to try this one again."

3.5,Hint medicinal. Heavy char. Full but not terribly complex. Finishes quickly. Solid dram

3.0,The only taste I can make out is peat. Fairly mild flavour.
4.0,"On the nose, lemon, briny,  herbal, almost olive notes. On the palate, there's a lemon cream,salted caramel, and a whiff of sweet pipe tobacco. With water, a smoky, almost sooty, profile emerges as some of the sweetness retreats. Very tasty, and intriguing in how much it changes with a touch of water...almost two whiskies for the price of one!"

3.0,"Sympa, peu de bois. Mais manque de fruité"
3.0,"light smoke on the nose, plum and fruity nose, jammy; smoke up front on the palate but then fades quickly, smooth, nothing incredibly unique but good flavor."

4.0,"I guess it's kind of like a stereotypical Islands dram. It's a little whiff of fruit, a little bit of peat and salt, a little bit of alcohol... It's drinkable, and a conversation starter, if you decide to call it French."
