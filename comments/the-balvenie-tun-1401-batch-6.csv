5.0,"Nose- signature honey comes through immediately giving way to sweet overripe blackberries
Body- glowing warmth that comes from an incredibly well balanced peat that is noticeably more pervasive than other Balvenies, this peat is brilliantly balanced with honey drizzled berries placed on toast with salted butter
Finish- the buttered toast comes through in the finish giving way to light cigar smoke and ocean brine
Note- I had this at MacMcgee's in Atlanta, GA. This is by far the most impressive scotch selection that I have seen. I mean amazing (220 scotches) To this point, this is the best whiskey that I have ever had. Incredible complexity and balance."
