4.0,"On the nose, strong notes of butterscotch, vanilla and toasted oak mixed with fainter notes of chocolate covered oranges and strawberry jam.  Very pleasant.

The palate starts out with creamy caramel and vanilla before fading to more floral and citrusy notes like rose and lemon.  The finish is rather muted for a 100 proof bourbon that is well-aged, but what does come to expression is a new oak and barrel char, leather and earthy tobacco notes.  A few drops of water bring the oak more forward in the palate and sweeten the bourbon with more vanilla notes.  A cinnamon spice presents itself in the finish.

Overall, it's great bourbon.  Its unique like the rest of the decanter series, but this one just doesn't stand out clearly like the 13 year and 14 year."
