2.0,"Day 17, back into Borubon territory (can't belive it's christmas next week). Not a fan of this. On the nose a lot of oak, some light caramel and salt. That's pretty much how it tastes, along with some vanilla. Not quite sure what's supposed to be sweet here, but this is anything but. One dimensional, bitter, thin. No real aftertaste. The Four Roses is far superior in my opinion."

5.0,Too bad you can’t find the 12 yr anymore. I’ll waiting patiently while stock ages to the point where it will be released again. Sadly I’m sure once re-released will be price gouged as this bourbon was being sold for $25-$28 a bottle here in California which was a steal. Lots of vanilla and caramel and as smooth of a bourbon as you can find.

4.0,"Review transfer from Barreled from February 2016. I’m glad I have a bottle of the 12 still in my collection. 

A superb bourbon. Lovely deep amber color. Intense vanilla, apples and oak spices on the nose, layers upon layers with this one. Very complex.  Vanilla and slight maple with oak on the palate. Not a huge finish but very smooth and incredibly easy to drink, even at 47%. It's a shame that Elijah Craig has taken off its 12 year age statement but it can only be attributed to their success and dwindling supplies. I hope the new NAS version, which will contain 8-12 YO bourbon, will not lack in quality and I suspect it will still be a great dram. 4.5"

3.25,"Murray’s Bible calls this a ‘hairy-chested bourbon’ and I can’t disagree. Though it’s only 47% alcohol it smells and tastes much stronger. It’s a deep orange in the glass, and it smells like a candy store run by a drunk, all butterscotch and booze. Sip it and the bombastic corn mash flavours swagger around your mouth and tongue until they cry surrender. The toasty vanilla finish goes on and on with only a hint of spice to liven it up. Though there’s not much complexity or subtlety here, the sheer braggadocio of this whisky is strangely endearing. I shall enjoy polishing off the bottle to make space for something else."

4.0,"2015 Bottling.
I have been enjoying a TW store pick single barrel recently, so I decided to try it against this bottle to see how it compares. In short, the 12 yr is vastly superior even against a great store pick.
Upon entry you are hit with rich burnt brown sugar and mollasas. Mid pallate features a clove swell that is quickly balanced out by some leather and tobacco notes. Finish is long and oak driven with some more of that lovely rich burnt brown sugar and vanilla. I am down to half a bottle and will be sad when the last pour is finally gone!"

Sample rating: +6.5 (for comparison, I gave the 2018 WLW +5.5)

Unfortunately, this bottle is not available anymore. I don’t know what secondary pricing is, but I can understand why people are bunkering multiples of this bottle. 

This is perfectly aged, precisely tuned bourbon. Rich nose, powerful palate, and smooth finish. The 12 years gets you the early tobacco profile without the leather-bound books that older bourbons have. Of course there’s also cherries, butterscotch, and loads of spice. This is chess; the NAS Elijah is checkers. This compares favorably to what I remember of Pappy 15, as it’s probably more complex and more flavorful. Seeing the Pappy was $65 a pour, I passed on the opportunity to do a side by side."
