4.5,Neat.  Nice nose.  Vanilla and floral.  Maybe cherry.  Fresh oak.  Nice creamy mouth feel.    Nice sugar and dark fruit on the tongue.  Lovely taste and long legs.  Strong vanilla.  No spice.  Complexity I can’t put into words.  Just a great sipper by a fire.

4.75,Excellent bourbon smooth and higher proof.  Hard to get but worth it.  Touch higher in price than I would like (hence the smaller rating than a true 5)

1.5,Sweet with strong burn  Harsh taste.  Short finish.  Can't get past the harsh taste.
4.25,"The nose on this one is bright fruity with hint of tea.
The palate a drastic change from the nose it is subtle vanilla with just a hint of spice the finish is clean and short. I can understand why some may take issue with this since the nose and palate aren't even close but both are great just exceptionally different."
