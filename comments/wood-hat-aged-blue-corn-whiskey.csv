3.5,"Chatted with part-owner and brand ambassador at a tasting in KC.

Actually very pleasant.  Definitely something for the WSR/MM crowd.  Sweet and easy, but still interesting. A crowd pleaser.

Would absolutely drink again and at a very respectable price point for being a small craft whiskey.  Not harsh in any way."
