3.5,"This a independently bottled Bunnahabhain consisting of 10 year old whisky casks that belong to Jack Wieber and that were bottled by Laing Co.

Nice clean and sweet nose introduces this pale umber whisky. It is a small batch and I assume there were only ex-bourbon casks used. There is also a nice vanilla and soft white wine on the nose that has some sweet vinegar qualities. Also apple crumble and dry straw. Very nice. Not overly intense but definitely with a lot of character. 

The palate arrives malty sweet with the right amount of soft ginger burn and a mild but distinct fruity sourness. A nice spicey and flavorful finish rounds this up to a enjoyable whisky. It is simple. It is straight forward. It is fresh. It is a nice whisky."
