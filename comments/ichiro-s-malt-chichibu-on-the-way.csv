4.75,"Tried the 2015 edition of this at a drammers club dekanta tasting. Aged in 1 bourbon cask, 1 refill cask, and 1 Mizunara cask. Very good with notes of Vanilla, Caramel, Lychee, Sandalwood, Yuzu, Peach, Mango, Flowers, Cherry, Pepper, Grass, and Coconut with a malty, buttery, and creamy mouthfeel."
3.5,"약간의 피트향, 중간맛과 향이 포인트"
4.0,"Awesome finish, a little bitter but not savory, sweet balanced by full bodied bitters, strong bite at the start"

4.25,"The 2013 bottling of this (the only I've tasted) is sublime. Tasting canned fruit brought me back to my childhood, the long finish snapped me back to the present. This whiskey gave me a journey, and one I thoroughly enjoyed, and isn't that the point? delicious"

4.0,"If this is on the way, I can't wait till it's there.  Obviously young, but doesn't show it.  Like a really well matured little kid that acts way ahead of his /her age.  Polished and elegant; quality through and through.  Nose opens with smoke and melons.  Flavors of salted caramel, green apples and ripe melons.  A bit of peaty smoke, but very different than the Islay or Islander.  I'm glad I bought a sample, but now wishing I got the full bottle."
