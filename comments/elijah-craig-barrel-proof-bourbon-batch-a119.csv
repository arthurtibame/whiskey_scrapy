4.0,"This was a review I did back in the fall of 2019 listed under the generic Elijah Craig Barrel Proof listing, so I thought I would put this in its proper place.

Batch A119 - tasted at a bar

The nose is brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and light leather.

The palate is a little sweet with vanilla and a big barrel/leathery note. And I also get a cola note. It almost seems carbonated for a second, which I’ve never gotten before from a whiskey. Maybe because it reminded me of coke? 
It has a thicker mouthfeel, but that gets lost with the dryness that happens to your tongue and cheeks. It really dries it out, like chalky almost.

All in all I like this one, but it’s the first Barrell Proof Elijah Craig. So I can’t compare to other batches."
4.25,This is the best Elijah Craig Barrel Proof I have had. Very approachable despite the proof. Delicious. This and Knob Creek Single Barrel are some of the best high proof bourbon values you can get. 12 years or older at cask strength. This is caramel oak bomb.

Non-chill filtered

Nose: rich and deep while a tad hot (a little water recommended), with note of molasses, raw maple syrup, demura and/or dark brown sugar, hint of nuttiness, melted toffee, candied pears and apples and some nice charred oak.

Taste: dark caramel; brown sugar; cinnamon red hots; leather; slight tobacco; creamy butterscotch.

Finish: goes on for days. Chocolate; Dark roast coffee; leather and balanced oak barrel.

Value: $65-80. Yes yes yes.

Final thoughts: Elijah Craig Barrel Proof is one of the best bourbons you can readily buy. With 3 releases annually (Jan; May; Sept) you’ll get slight variations with each batch but all will rise to the occasion. This is what bourbon is all about, comrades. 

Score: 5/5. Buy it right now!

4.75,"Let it sit and breathe for a few minutes and this bourbon is amazing. Nose is sweet, heavy vanilla, burnt sugar and oak. Rich and creamy mouth feel, intense and spicy. Palate not as sweet as the nose. Spicy oak comes to the front, pepper first, then vanilla and caramel, with cinnamon and a hint of cherry syrup. Finish is long and vibrant. The explosion of flavor lingers on the palate, and this bourbon doesn't let you forget it's high proof. At first taste, I did not think this batch matched batch B518. On second taste, I think it is at least as good, maybe slightly better. Slightly different profile, with a little less sweetness and more spice, but a damn good dram."

4.5,"The nose carries classic bourbon smells of vanilla, coconut and caramel, but also packs a nice citrus punch. On the arrival, there's some decent heat, black pepper and more vanilla. Orange peel and barrel spices dominate the mid-palate, creating excellent complexity and balance. The finish is dry, and brings back the coconut and pepper, while introducing dark chocolate, barrel char and some nuttiness. A truly fantastic bourbon at a fairly affordable price."

4.5,"After a lonnnnggggg week of trying to keep my patience dealing petulance that I typically associate with 6 yr olds, I needed a stiff dram. I bought this one a couple weeks back and recently killed the C918 batch, so why not give this one a try! Quick point of clarity, the Distiller Age states NAS when this is a 12 yr age stated Bourbon (for the time being). It's also one of the strongest batches in recent memory coming in at 135.2 proof. Let's see if we can survive this one neat. On to the tasting:
Right upon entry you are hit with vanilla, burnt brown sugar, cherry and oak. It's a lovely, restrained flavor bomb that leads to a baking spice filled mid pallette. This leads to a long oak, cocoa, tobacco, leather and black pepper finish with a hint of strawberry. 
Even for the ever reliable ECBP, this is an outstanding batch. It easily bests the C918 and rivals the great 2017 vertical. This batch seems to be a lot smaller than the C918 which was easily available (I can still find bottles at SRP). I bought 2 bottles of this one and haven't seen any since. If you see them, scoop them up as you won't be dissapionted. 
Cheers all!"

4.5,"Bottle pour at home, neat, into a Glencairn.  Lucked into the bottle at the Seven Corners ABC, sitting in the corner nearly out of sight (last of their 3 bottle allocation).  Nose has definite heat, but not overwhelming.  Oaky and nutty, caramel and vanilla.  Nice.  Taste is surprisingly sweet, with some mild heat and spice coming on.  Caramel and vanilla shine here.  Pepper spice lingers, but mildly.  This is great stuff.  5/26/19"
4.75,The words for this treat are almost indescribable. Cherry and vanilla with oak and spice. Shockingly smooth for such a high proof. Adding water stunts the beautiful nose some but does help cool the finish just a tad. I loved this one so much I decided to pick up 2 cases so I will be able to enjoy this years from now.

4.25,Strongest bourbon I’ve ever tasted but not the harshest. Lots of flavor. Has a sweetness to it. Good one to add to the collection.
4.75,Everytime I revisit this I fall in love all over again. It's like Carmel and toasted marshmallow heaven that wakes up every tastebud even some you didnt know existed. A119 is lights out
4.75,"Tasting:  Neat in glen cairn, 2 oz pour.

Nose: (5.0)  Everything a bourbon should be!  Caramel, oak, vanilla for days, and burnt brown sugar.  Remember those scratch and sniff stickers the teachers used to put on our papers for 100% grade?......the nose on this bourbon should be the scratch and sniff sticker for adults.  Really well done.

Palate: (4.75) The nose comes through on the palate with just the right amount of heat and spice.  I get some red fruit, perhaps apple?  If there was a knock it might be complexity, but for me well orchestrated trumps complication.

Finish (5.0):  Oak comes through a bit more, caramel fades to butterscotch, and some spice kicks in.  Finishes as good as it starts.

Overall:  This might be my standout of the year.  So far it is the best thing I have had this year.  A119 may be that one batch that if you hadnt gotten in on yet, you will pay for it later.  Looking forward to B519 when it drops in Illinois."

4.5,"Alright, alright, alright!  A house to myself on this Friday evening.  Weather is good. Yankees v Red Sox (I am a suffering Mets fan however), GoT catching up and a pour of A119 I have graciously received from @dubz480  I have been anxious to sample this after reading glowing review after another.  Perfect night for a bourbon and this one seems to fit the bill. 

The color is a ambered-copper and quite rich. 

Candied corns initially greet you. Though high in proof at 135.2%, the alcohol notes are well contained.  After some time, the nose sweetens most prominently.  Deep brown sugar slightly burned), vanilla, caramel.  But there is a fruity side as well.  Canned cherries, strawberries, grape soda and toasted coconut.  Add a dash of autumn spice of cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon for good measure.  Quite a busy nose. Quite good. 

As this enters the palate, weighty and chewy, all is immediately and briefly anesthetized.  Once the numbness fades, the flavors are detectable.  Vanilla, brown sugar, dark chocolate, (real) maple syrup, which all briefly stay sweet.  The sweetness dampened, spices emerge.  Ground cinnamon, black pepper, chili powder and nutmeg.  All rich and deep. 

Once the liquid is no more, the lingering effects remain semi permanently. Leather, oak, caramel, milk chocolate, mild hints of charcoal and dried tobacco, like an unsmoked cigar.  

Adding a good dose of water rounds those spicy, jagged edges and softens.  The sweetness is dulled but the baking spices remain and prominent.  Maybe too much water was added, but this is more vibrant unaltered.  However, whatever dose of water you may add, it takes a good fifteen minutes plus to really fuse.

An absolute gem and wonderful bourbon.  Comparatively, where Bookers is more woody and dry, this has a more dominant sweetness.  This bourbon is approachable, easy sipping and packs a solid set of aromas and flavors.  Drink this, but not too much, albeit quite easily possible, after hours where you have some quiet time.  It will not disappoint.  A must try/have.  You can easily find this at a relatively bargain price. I just grabbed a Batch B518 for $59.  I may have to grab another. (By the way, Yanks beat Red Sox 4-1 and Mets are leading Diamondbacks). [93/100][Tasted: 5/31/19]"

4.5,"Just tried this next to the B519

Beautiful deep amber color. 

Smell is very sweet, enticing. I can picture myself drinking this on a crisp fall day. Vanilla, caramel are what stand out. Wouldn’t know it was this high proof from the smell. 

Very full taste, much more so than B519. Honey sweet up front that spreads across the tongue with vanilla then turns to nice, smooth spicy notes. Still wouldn’t know the high proof, it’s that smooth. 

To me the finish wasn’t quite as long as B519 and did not get the “blossoming” effect but still very nice. Caramel lingers on the tongue with a hint of oak. 

Close, but A119 wins the battle for now."

4.5,"Back in the day (to be fair, meaning just three or four years ago), there were a few batches of this seasonal release that weighed in very close to 70% ABV, which is so high it's almost unbearable.  We tried one of these mashers, from 2016, and it was tough to chew through at times, although very rewarding on some (tiny) sips.  This early 2019 release is the strongest Elijah Craig Barrel Proof to come out in years, but it's much better balanced and quite an accomplishment.

If there are two immutable characteristics in every Elijah Craig, it's a heavy-metal chord of vanilla and a lumberyard worth of oak.  That's exactly what we're dealing with here, along with bushels of black cherries, sweet tea, and sage.  This is more of a dessert dram than recent releases, with a little less char and smoke, but these differences are marginal between batches at a certain point.  Elijah Craig Barrel Proof is instantly recognizable, with a character possessed by no other bourbon that I've encountered.  It's also my favorite bourbon, bar none, and this one just further confirms it."

5.0,"This is my second batch of ECBP. The C917 is one of the top few whiskies I've ever had. Hell, even the standard Small Batch is some really good stuff. With the 92 rating on Distiller, I've got some expectations going into this one. And as a side note, I'd like to point out this is the strongest bottle I've ever owned in any category, clocking in at a whopping 67.6% ABV.

Nose: Caramel and cocoa jump right out of the glass. Toasted marshmallow and roasted coffee. Butterscotch. Some dry fruit and citrus notes. Pencil shavings and a touch of leather that I can't quite compare to any particular item (somewhere between a new baseball glove and an old book cover). I even get some of the carrot cake I get in Henry McKenna and even a bit of tobacco ash. Loads of cinnamon, allspice, and oak. Some barrel char. A bit of a burn but enticing nonetheless. Great start.

Palate: Caramel, vanilla, cocoa, and cola sweetness are accompanied by something that I can only describe as a Hawaiian Punch Gusher. Oddly specific, but I cannot deny that it's there. Carrot cake and candy corn. A bit of cherry and some dried fruit. Hazelnut, almond and maybe some roasted pecan. Barrel char is now out in full force. Just a touch of milk chocolate. It's very oaky, and some of the cinnamon, black pepper, clove, nutmeg, and allspice notes start to creep up at the tail end of the palate.

Finish: Black pepper, gloce, nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice. Loads of oak. A real spice bomb. Caramel and vanilla, roasted coffee and tobacco smoke. Barrel char and lemon and orange citrus notes. Some more carrot cake. Even though it's a spice bomb, there's a lot more going on in what makes for an extremely long finish. Well done.

Superb. 5/5. Not sure if it's better than the C917, but I'll tell you why it's worthy of similar praise. This takes some of the best aspects of the C917, which is ultimately darker and more decadent, and combines them with some of the sweet and tangy notes typically found in Henry McKenna. This Batch tows the line between two of my all-time favorites and presents that combination in a uncut, unfiltered, and unprecedented expression.

At $75, this is a steal. I'd gladly pay more. There is much to love here. They've moved pretty far past this one, as I think it's already over a year old. If you can still find it, I highly recommend buying on sight. After two 5-star batches, I'm a batch or two away from crowning ECBP as on the greatest lines in all of whiskey. Cheers!"
4.5,Needed this one tonight to punch me in the mouth. Crazy way to start the week 😅
3.75,"ECBP was my white whale for so long.  It was impossible to get.  So A119

Nose - Caramel and oak.  So sweet and yet it's a pretty simple whisky.  Just those two notes in intense ways.  

Taste - More of the same.  Rich and intense oak and caramel, the oak is wonderfully even in nature.  Adds a bit of bitter but doesn't go to the extremes.  Meanwhile so much caramel, truly intense.  This is the perfect example of intense bourbon notes but while I get why people think of this as a perfect bourbon, it's not close.  The oak is a bit young and yet 12 years give it an intense oak note.  It's that weird we're not dealing with well aged bourbon but there's a lot of oak.  Sweet beyond words.  

This stuff is every bit worth the hype at 60 bucks a bottle.  But no it isn't ""WOW"" and it isn't all that special in the bourbon world.  It's the result of in part a lack of high quality bourbon so we see it as amazing."

4.5,"This is my first experience with Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, and the highest proof bourbon I've tasted so far. The initial nose is surprisingly light on alcohol, very deceptive. I get dried dark fruit, and with a deeper inhale, oak and alcohol.

Big dessert spice/sweet oak overwhelm the tongue, much stronger than the fruit from the nose. I also get vanilla and chocolate that are in tune with the spiced oak flavor. The alcohol burn is lighter than expected. The finish is super long and oily. The alcohol is most prominent on the finish, and the dark fruit reemerges along with dessert spice and tannins.

I normally avoid adding water to any of my whiskey these days, but with a proof this high I figured I should try it. After a small splash of water, the oak and alcohol are stronger on the nose than before. The taste is more tannic with added water, which clearly brings out the oak and alcohol flavor. In my opinion it gets worse with water, muting the fruit, vanilla, and spice. 

Overall this is a fantastic cask strength bourbon and I think in the future I'll try to buy one of the releases once a year. The EC A119 is not my favorite high proof bourbon, but it is widely available and a tremendous value. You cannot say the same for a lot of cask strength offerings."
3.75,"The abv is so high that you can feel the whiskey evaporating off your tongue when you sip it, very strange sensation. The flavors are dark, rich, and intense. Turns out that’s not entirely a good thing by itself. Really needs something bright in there to provide balance and keep it interesting. But if you want to be overwhelmed by caramel, vanilla, leather, etc. then it’s worth a shot."
4.5,"EC small batch was what got me into bourbon years ago, and now this barrel proof is like graduating to the big leagues. At 135.2 it’s definitely hot, but not overwhelming. Orange citrus, spicy rye, leather, and charred wood...it’s everything that is Elijah Craig, but turned up to 11."
4.5,Excellent of course but prefer B518 hands down.
