4.0,"Exotic finish, with smooth subtly"
2.5,"maple, oak, laundry soap, resin, corn, peaches, very light and thin; I understand the idea of highlighting the oak variety, but this would be much better with a heavier char"
5.0,Top 5 Bourbon for me (if this is really bourbon?). Outstanding flavors?

4.5,"I'm not generally a big bourbon fan (I love my ryes and islay scotch) but saw this earlier today and decided to pick it up. A new offering from Buffalo Trace, aged 10 years in barrels made from the ""Quercus mongolica"" oak trees in Mongolia that apparently persevere in tortuous weather conditions.  Vanilla notes on the nose and with the first sip, it's very light. Vanilla, raisins, burnt sugar on the finish. It's a lovely drink. Cannot believe it's a bourbon. I'm somewhat new to articulating what I like about whisky but have been drinking a great deal of them for the last 6 years. Pardon the review but I know what I like and this is superb."
