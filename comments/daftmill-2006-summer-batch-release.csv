4.5,"Managed to get a sample bottle for a reasonable price.

Nose: fruity and floral. Lots of gorse, hints of banana and vanilla, flower petals—lilies? Not even a hint of sharpness, it is smooth and round. It’s almost as though I’ve stuck my head in a gorse bush (without the thorns). Very sweet, very tropical. Hints of white grape. Buttery, and somewhat shortbready or biscuity.
Body: spicy?! I didn’t expect that from the nose! Peppery. Then Rounded and full. Juicy. 
Palate: very well balanced. stays floral and herbaceous. Salt and pepper at first, followed by vanilla, oak, and a bit of lemon zest. Perhaps a little hint of thyme? Honey, sun cream.
Finish: woody and spicy."
3.5,"Hmm I really should stop chasing whiskey unicorns real or imagined..some are great,  others aren't but all are over priced. I think a bottle of this is something stupid like $300 USD here. I scored a sample of this for a measily $40USD after shipping and taxes and one compound word sums it up OVERPRICED. I'd be ok as a bog standard drink at $40USD a bottle but nearly ten times the price forget it. Dingle batch 2 was a 1/3rd of the price and at least a third better.

Hard pass unless you like chasing overpriced unicorns."
