3.5,"This is in the port-finish/other-finish division of my finished bourbon bracket. Quick recap of the blind taste tests so far:

Joseph Magnus, Noble Oak, Wild Turkey Revival, Rabbit Hole division.
WT Revival won division.

This division:
Isaac Bowman vs Angel’s Envy
IB won.

This next round is Amador Double Barrel vs Jefferson’s Grand Selection (Sauternes). After this is Jefferson’s old rum cask vs Beer Barrel Bourbon. Did I mention that this is for science?

Nose on this is very faint, which is surprising to me. Very low astringency, and if you really jam your nose down in there you can get some hints of jelly and possibly tomato sauce. If the whiff hits me as a sweet scent, it’s the jelly. If it’s savory, it’s the marinara. Can’t get both together.

The body delivery’s on the grape jelly flavor. The sweetness from the wine is super evident. I can’t get much besides the grape jelly.

Finish carries off more grape jelly, with a bit of cinnamon. Don’t know where the marinara thing comes in, but even now I’m getting on the nose despite the flavor being nonexistent in the drink.

This is a bit less interesting than I’d hoped given its sticker price. I enjoy it, it’s just very basic. That grape flavor is intense. Definitely would not buy again, but it won’t keep me from getting excited about the other products in the Jefferson’s lineup.

For me, this beats Amador, but that’s less a statement of greatness for Jefferson’s and more an indictment of Amador."

2.5,Taste isn’t bad but has a really weird nose. Bad enough to almost ruin it entirely.  Definitely not worth the price.
3.0,Grape jelly nose and grape jelly all over the tongue. Nice lightly spicy finish.
