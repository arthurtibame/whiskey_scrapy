3.5,Good scotch flavor and a bit light
3.75,Intense honey note. Like a honeyed speyside scotch. Texture is pretty nice - non chill filtered. Actually pretty tasty. Curious which distillery provides this.

3.25,"Nose: vanilla, honeyed, sweet
Body: medium
Palate: spice, floral, vanilla sweetness, peppery with a light malt
Finish: medium
Note: ok, not enough body for my liking. Also makes me wonder if all Japanese whiskey has rice in it. Like their secret sauce."
3.75,starts bitter and goes to almonds then vanilla caramel.

3.5,"Nose- pear and vanilla
Body- lemon zest and pear continue with a light touch of vanilla
Finish- light and airy with vanilla and honeysuckle 

This is a light airy whiskey, perhaps even muted but it is a nice one."

3.5,"Tasted 11/14/18 at Whisky House San Diego 

Very mild, but enjoyable. A typical, well balanced Japanese whisky."
3.75,"I rather enjoyed this. Honey and apple notes. Actually more heat than I anticipated. Initial flavor was cereal/grain, followed by almonds and vanilla for the finish."
