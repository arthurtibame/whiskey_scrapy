3.0,"Had it at the distillery and bought a bottle because it stood out as far as how smooth it was. Got back to my home state and just tried it again, I am not disappointed in my purchase. The rye is there but not overwhelming, and just as I remember, super smooth. At the price point, it is a good buy!"
0.5,"Nose: ethanol, light vanilla, cinnamon and caramel
Mouthfeel: viscous but clingy
Taste: mild lingering Kentucky hug, light flavors of butter and caramel with a lingering carbon taste. I can't find a strong note for the life of me.
I was told this kept continuously moves and I don't get it."
