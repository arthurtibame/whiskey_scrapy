4.0,"Very nicely balanced bour-rye blended whiskey. Nose is very citrus think buffalo trace and butterscotch forward. Musty corn note, vanilla, corn syrup sweetness, damp oak and light baking spice note and no alcohol burn present you can really pull the nose out of the glass. Palate is velvet and oily again no burn sweet corn syrup, vanilla, caramel with oak and apple and light orange citrus notes. Palate end with very slight spiciness from the rye and baking spices but isn't as harsh as the typical black pepper from traditional rye. Finish is shortish medium with the sweetness the apple and citrus and oak notes on the finish beginning to end. Very enjoyable, and drinkable."
3.5,"Nose: strawberries, confectioners sugar, pipe tobacco, bubble gum, pine
Taste: rye spice, cinnamon, mint
Finish: rye bread
After reading reviews: not a lot out there but candy sweetness and rye spiciness seem to be the dominant theme, and I agree.  This was pretty hyped by the Bourbon Junkies, so I had higher expectations than I probably should have and it didn’t live up to those.  Kind of a unique flavor profile though, so good to have around for a change of pace."

3.5,Nose is suggestive of traditional bourbons impressing with vanilla and oak while displaying a complexity that is signature on any good blend. Very well-rounded with great upfront spice and a slight sweetness on the front pallet. The back yields a slight comforting warmth that is representative of traditionally complex flavors.
3.75,"Neat. Neck pour. The youngness is there and inescapable but there is something really nice behind it.  It’s a laffy taffy note, blend of banana and strawberry I think.  Next note I get is hot dry wood, which I get in some Texas whiskeys.  Rye is really starting to emerge.  I struggle to find the bourbon in this compared to the rye but I like it as a three year rye if you told me that (especially at the price.)

For 90 proof it is surprising oily and thick in texture.  The initial sweetness on the tongue is like coconut water.  The laffy taffy then returns next and leaves the legs with a cinnamon and rye.

So there is a bubble gum note that I am not a fan of that typically emerges from new craft distilleries.  This laffy taffy note doesn’t turn me off as much.  I kind of like it.  At $30ish bucks, this is an interesting Whiskey to try but not a great whiskey compared to other bourbon/rye blends (but those are two to three times the price too!)"
