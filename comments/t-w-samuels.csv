4.5,"T.W. Samuels Bottled In Bond bourbon is a Heaven Hill product that is only available in the Kentucky area.  It is also only available in a 1.75 plastic bottle and costs about 24 bucks.  Yeah I know, I don’t like plastic bottles either but don’t let that scare you off on this one.  Years ago Heaven Hill also bottled it in a 750 glass bottle but discontinued it.  Be careful if you see this one at your liquor store as there is an 80 proof version out there and it looks just like this one except it does not say Bottled In Bond 100 proof. The color is brown to dark red.  The legs are thin and start fast but then slow down and sheets of alcohol just stick to the glass.  The nose is vanilla, caramel, buttered popcorn, and oak.  The taste is vanilla, brown sugar, peanuts, caramel, and oak.  It has a medium finish with the vanilla and caramel really coming through.  It feel very creamy on your tongue.  There is also some nuttiness, sweetness and oak that linger. This one does not drink like a 100 proof whiskey."
