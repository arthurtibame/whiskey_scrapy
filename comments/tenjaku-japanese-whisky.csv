4.25,"Japanese whisky never ceases to impress me. This one is very mild, and has an almost wine-like aroma. Mellow and sweet."
3.5,"Honey, green apple, and cherry blossom nose; honey, apple, and young mizunara oak; a significant burn, medium texture; spiced apple finish"
2.5,"Young,alcaholic, grain spirit is dominant. Easy to drink and short finish. Color added? I think...yes."
3.5,Good amount of vanilla with some fruit elements...maybe pear? Smells is not the best

3.75,Неплохо за свою цену
3.75,"Solid, smooth, young whisky-blend for a reasonable price. Nothing that will blow your socks off but an excellent bargain for a Japanese import, of whom are extremely maticulous and attent to detail. Presentation is elegant and makes it feel like youre drinking something much more expensive. Moderate to highly recommended depending on your persuasion to cheaper blends"
