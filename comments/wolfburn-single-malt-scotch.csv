3.0,"'16 Whiskey Advent - very light color, mellow - solid.  Little harsh."
3.0,Packs a punch which is a not hugely surprising given he colour. Strong pepper kick on entry driven way to salty pear. Happy sipper but a bit to young for my taste. Having said that would be a nice addition to the cabinet for variety.

4.0,"Well, Old Pulteney's been beat out on the northernmost mainland distillery front...but how's the booze from Wolfburn? The nose is pleasant, with a more tropical vibe than one would expect from the far northern coast of Scotland - in addition to sea spray and vanilla, there are banana chips, coconut, lime curd, and green apple. The palate is very obviously young (this barely meets the legal definition by age for Scotch whisky), but is at least a fun, playful kind of dram, with salted caramel, vanilla, a light fruitiness, and some young spirit burn. This is not something I would want to drink on an ongoing basis, but as a taste of good things to come, I'd say that Wolfburn is one to keep an eye on as their stock matures. A little more time in the barrels, and this is going to be some seriously good stuff. I'd call this a 3 on its own merits, but I'm giving it 4 stars due to its youth - it's still better than the vile 36 month old crap that composes most cheap blends."

I really had high hopes for this one, but it has a ways to go; still a bit too young.  It's crisp, fresh, lemon-y.  Quick finish.  It's not bad, but just a bit young and needs time to show its true potential.  Between this and Ailsa Bay (can't help but compare since that has its first 3 Yr old out too), I prefer Ailsa Bay by far."

3.0,"I reached for this one as I was winding down after working a slow, overnight shift.  This is one of the final few samples from the distillery tour I'm doing with some friends.

This one is very, very light in color and in aroma.  After letting it sit in the glass for upwards of 10 minutes all I'm getting is a faint, lemon furniture polish scent.  It's not disgusting, but it's also not very inviting.  A few moments later and even that aroma is gone.  Hmm...

On the palate, well, there just isn't much there.  It's a tad harsh, which is somewhat expected since it's just a tad over 3 years old.  There's no oak detected either.  It's lively and fresh with a nice pop of heat from the ABV, but it all washes away quickly through the finish.  Nothing hangs around long, either.  It's forgettable.

Overall, it's the epitome of young whisky and that's okay.  I just wish there was something there that could excite my curiosity for when they finally release something with some age to it.  I'm not sure I'd seek this out anytime soon.  Thanks to my friend Pranay for offering it up and giving me a chance to get a taste.  Let's keep moving, though.  2.75 stars.  Cheers, my friends."

2.0,"Opened the sample of this after working in the yard in the (finally) warming sun.  I was planning to sample another but I inadvertently opened this sample.  Maybe that was good thing?
  
  The nose is faint, extremely faint, almost undetectable.  Some floral and honey and granola can be found, but you need to put the work in to find almost anything (at least for me).  Starting out on the left foot by making me work for aromas (a good nose really makes the experience much more enjoyable) the whisky arrived extremely lightweight.  Slight honey sweetness with vanilla and caramel.  A touch of smoke is detectable.  After the brief sweetness, the palate gets a zing of young hotness of white pepper.  All this leads to a short finish of light brown sugar, wood, cinnamon with a last bit of zing of fresh ginger root.  
  
  This was a uninspiring, non-dynamic whisky.  It finds a middle of the road but in doing so, finds itself lost in the crowd.  Mediocre and average.  The good thing….this leaves hopes for the sample I wanted to have.  Pranay, thank you for the sample. [Dry Glass: could not detect anything][82/100][Tasted: 4/9/17]"

3.0,"Stop number 6 on the SDT is Wolfburn. This is the northernmost distillery in mainland Scotland. Although the age is not part of the name of this whisky, it is 3 years old and is part of the inaugural bottling of the distillery. Aged in ex bourbon quarter casks, it's 46% ABV and non chill filtered. It is also natural color of very pale white wine. The lightest color scotch I've ever seen, but in no way does that bother me. 

There is a very strong malty character initially on the nose. Bright citrusy notes, but also somewhat harsh like lemon pledge. Tart/sour apples. A little briny and medicinal with light peat smoke. Some nuttiness like walnuts. After sitting in the glass for a while there is a pear note and green grapes that show up. There's no mistaking that this is a young whisky, but it's not something I would turn my nose up at either. 

The palate is initially slight sour apples. Very peppery with a light peat smoke. A little vegetal with some oaky notes. More pepper. Again, young but good. 

Medium bodied mouthfeel, mouthwatering that turns semi dry. If you hold it too long in your mouth (20-30 seconds) it will numb the front half of the roof of your mouth. Medium length finish with a light smoke, pepper, oak and citrus. 

Imagine if you will, that Laphroaig and Glenfiddich had a baby. That baby then grew up and went to the prom with Talisker and after a few too many  schnapps they did what many teenagers do and wound up with their own little bundle of joy. That's when we have here. It's medicinal and smoky with light fruit and maltiness and a strong peppery backbone. There is more complexity than I expected, but it's still young in many areas. Eager to see what this will become in 7-15 years. Thanks to Pranay for the sample."

3.0,"Had the opportunity to sample this in a train station in Taipei. Non chill filtered, natural color and 46% all positives in my book. You could tell right away that it was young, how young they do not say. We will have to wait a few more years to see how this turns out, but they are on the right track."

3.5,"This malt has always intrigued me since I first saw the bottle, simply stunning presentation. Acquired a sample today. A floral nose with a faint hint of orchard fruits. Slightly sour on the palate, green apples and some spices. The finish is relatively short. Overal a decent dram, needs some extra aging though. Would still pick up a bottle if its reasonably priced. Reminds me of Arran and Tobermory."

4.0,"Nose: Biscuit / graham cracker maltyness. Caramel. Vanilla. Lemony citrus. Apricot / light plum. Some Oak /mustiness. 

Taste: Sweet vanilla, almost powdered sugar. Light plums / apricots / almost dark cherry. Strong oak / mustiness. Sage / basil. Some light floral notes. Very sweet upfront, turning citrusy and finishing with an oak bitterness. Water intensifies the finish but adds some sweetness at the end to take some of the bitter away. Added a few drops of Islay Mist 8 and got some brown sugar and cinnamon notes.   

Very light almost white wine color. Decent legs. Alcohol is very bitey despite only being 46% Non age statement but no color and not chill filtered. Originally it was $60, but I got it on clearance for 45. It's a lovely dram but not worth the msrp in my opinion. 45 is a decent price for it. I would actually say it's a decent one to get to convert someone from bourbon to scotch if they like the more intense oak notes and don't mind the sweetness."

3.5,"Summerton Virtual Whisky Festival sample.

Smoky, oily and a little spicy upfront.  There are some nice peaty flavours that hide the fact that this is only a 3-year old whisky.  They have used some ex-Laphroaig Quarter Casks and it certainly comes through on the flavour profile.

It’s well balanced and easy to drink.  It’s quite a light smoke and earthiness that comes through to the finish, but alongside the honey sweetness.  I could spend a good evening on this.  Nice!"

3.5,Enjoyed this and would seek this distillery out in the future once it gets rolling. Nose suggests some peat and spice and front of the tongue soothes you with a pleasant coating of fruit and butter. Then an intense spicy surge hits and flames out quickly into a warm subtle aftertaste.

3.5,"Wolfburn tasting evening at The Oak Barrel, Sydney, May 30th 2019: Whisky #1

Nose: Fruity and floral, with a very subtle musky note. Rounded and full nose focused on a few primary aromas but showing excellent integration and body. There is a very light peaty hint that becomes more apparent as the whisky rests and opens, and a faint mist of brine.

Palate: A spicy sweet arrival that suddenly explodes in a flash of peppery-spice heat in the development. This lasts a few seconds, and then rolls away as quickly as it appeared. There are a few sour-spice notes but these are balanced by a light honeyish nougat sweetness. The texture is very clean and crisp and over time a cereal presence becomes apparent.

Finish: Medium/short. The palate falls away fairly quickly leaving a pleasantly mild sweet spice note.

This is not a particularly complex whisky but that is not meant as a criticism. It has a crisp clarity of profile, a brisk, exuberant presentation and it is certainly not a lightweight.

The nose has weight and presence that exceeds your expectations of a 3-year old whisky, and the palate has a satisfyingly youthful character. It has some similarity to Kilchoman 100% Islay.

I considered making a new listing for this expression because Northland has gone through some changes and is now quite different to early batches.  Most importantly, maturation now takes place entirely in refill American oak quarter casks sourced from Laphroaig. Yes, that’s right – the used casks that Laphroaig uses for their Quarter Cask whisky are purchased by Wolfburn and recycled for this expression.

You can just barely perceive the character of smoky whisky in the background, and once you know the cause you can almost believe you sense a whiff of Laphroaig. However what the casks actually contribute (besides accelerated maturation) is texture and body – the Laphroaig character is just a gauzy background curtain.

Adding water makes little difference and I’d recommend taking this very pleasant whisky neat.

“Good” : 3.5 stars"

2.25,"I really tried to like it when I tasted this as a first of the Wolfburn line. Their story, standards and procedures really got me interested and as their “flagship” whisky this one really is nothing special. It is very young and tasty - a light Allrounder - but that is about it. It is gone right after you swallowed a sip, which gives you some very light fruity flavors and a very very minor hint of peat. It really isn’t bad but it needs like double its age in some heavy casks to really give it a uniqueness."
