4.5,"This winner of the World Whiskies Awards and other stuff, as the best blended malt in the world has dissapointed me. Don't get me wrong, it is a good dram, i even granted a 91 over 100, but i kinda hoped for something spectacular for a whisky that costs around 250 dollars for a half litre bottle. (I had a sample so dont think i am throwing away money lol). Bottled at 47.5%abv, with a deep copper color. The legs on the glencairn are very appealing. This is a blended malt made by Master of Malt, a whisky online retailer. On the nose it is absolutely amazing. Embodied by an elegant tobbacco note, everytime you nose it, something different appears: chocolate, a dim peatyness, brown raisin cake, prunes, butterscotch, recently baked butter cake, nutella, hanuta, hazelnuts, slight elegant lemon, orange candy, fresh tangerine, and something spicy that tingles your nose. Amazing. Having described all that, the palate is nice, but a little boring and not living up to what the nose offered you. Cereal, orange, tobbacco, very very very very smooth as if it were water, clove and dim spicyness, dry brown grasses and an ashy, chocolate note for the aftertaste which is medium to long. Overall i give this dram a 91 over 100, and i got to say i would not pay 250 for a bottle lf it, i believe 75-90 would be a more proper price for what it offers. Cheers!"
5.0,"Tried this at a Boutique-y Whisky Company tasting. Not available for sale and discontinued, was brought in by the rep. The rep had a powerpoint showing flavor profiles based on 2 numbers with conclusions on distillery, age, color, chill filtering, etc. This one has 10% Ardbeg stock and some stock very old. Great stuff with notes of caramel, apples, raisins, delicate smoke, salty/fishy brine, with a long sweet smoke finish."
