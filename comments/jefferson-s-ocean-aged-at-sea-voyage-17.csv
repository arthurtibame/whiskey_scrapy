4.0,Neat.  Party Source store pick.  Solid but I think I like the Voyage 16 better.  Nose is nice but subtle.  Vanilla and pepper.  Texture is nice and creamy.  Not too much flavor on the tongue but the taste has nice waves.  Starts out spice forward but transitions to a buttery vanilla and caramel.  Transitions back to a spicy long finish.  The salty characteristic of the 16 are much more subtle.  There is a uniqueness to the 16 that is much more straight forward with this batch.

3.75,"Nose is toffee, caramel, oak & honeysuckle.

Taste is similar with some sea air. I’m an Islay Scotch fan and there’s no peat but I do get the seaside effect be it ever so subtle.

This is a great sipper even at 90 proof. If you like Laugavulin, Talisker, Highland Park or Bowmore you should enjoy this."
4.5,Coconut and banana on the nose give way to an amazing combination of sweet honey and walnut palate. Oak on the finish is smooth and not overpowering.
4.25,"Nose: it smells like the island. Smell a lot of island fruits, especially banana. 

Taste: salted carmel candies. Tastes very sweet, has a smooth finish. Can definitely taste the sea salt with fruits like pineapple. 

So freaking good! Easy to drink with super unique flavors."

4.0,"Never in my whiskey drinking life have I had such a flash back to another whiskey I have already had and loved. I opened this bottle, poured my first two fingers and took a double take at my collection. I thought I had accidentally poured Angels Envy Finished Rye......

Nose: barrel mustiness, rye spice, vanilla, slight caramel. 

Taste: vanilla extract, rye spice, buttery (almost like pancake syrup), finishes into a oily sweet corn mustiness. 

This whiskey blew my mind. The Angles Envy Finished Rye is one of the most unique tasting whiskeys I have ever had. I almost mistook Jefferson’s Ocean for that exact whiskey. The AE has more of a maple syrup taste to it that the JO does not. Other than that they are very very similar. Voyage 17 has more than impressed me. Excellent whiskey."

4.25,Definite vanilla tone but my first taste def had a cherry hint and that was before I knew that cherry was a tasting feature. A strong body for sure- do i like above reg. Jefferson or the Cabernet barrel aged? Not sure. Would I purchase for future - not necessarily.

4.5,"The nose is soft, vanilla and honey. Taste is strikingly similar to Angels Envy Rye but without the rye spice. Very upfront dessert vanilla and almost marshmallowy sweetness with some corn flavors in the background.
Not your typical bourbon at all, but it is fantastic. All the super sweet nonsense of Angel's Envy Rye is taken out, tamed to an enjoyable level and the rye spice is replaced with some bourbon characteristics like corn and honey."

4.0,"Second taste edit: had it again and liked it more, bumping this bit up yet again to a 4.0.
I’m a fan of this unique bourbon. Wood spice is pronounced. It’s not as much like licking a salted barrel as the  Bunnahabhain, but it’s great and briny in a different way. This certainly has hints of salted caramel, but moreso, I get salted soft pretzel, which anyone who knows me knows is one of my favorite things. The nose gives me freshly baked pretzel. Light fruit flavor and the finish is pretty quick. Fearfully and wonderfully made, this whiskey."

3.5,Herbal. Short hot finish.
4.25,"Very unique and enjoyable sip, lives up to the price. Goes down too well for 90 proof. 

Nose brings vanilla, and sweet fruit of pear and coconut. 

A good bit of spice when first tasted, which surprised me given the lead of sweet. Carmel, honey and a little corn come in later, with fruit of banana and coconut again towards the end. 

Coconut and salt linger on a nice long finish. Dries the mouth out with salt, but keeps me coming back for more. 

One of the best Bourbons I’ve tasted, and certainly the most unique. Truly tastes like it’s travelled the world, from the tropical fruit to the brine finish. They knocked this out of the park. Only complaint is the price tag."

4.5,Nose is elegant floral with honey tones and a hint of citrus. Orange dominates the front of the pallet and spikes into a healthy spicy burn. Finishes with rose. A damn fine bourbon with unique flavors.

4.25,"Strong caramel and toffee smell, but not flavor. A very smooth and balanced taste, with notes of vanilla and spices that hit the back of your throat. The finish is truly unique because the very last thing you taste is sea salt. 
         In reading the ships log included with this bottle the trip was very smooth with temps never dropping below freezing. I would definitely recommend this as something to enjoy, and will look to compare it with other Jefferson Ocean Aged bottles that have a more tumultuous travel history. 
         I initially tried it with ice as was recommended on the bottle which does eliminate the spice on the back of my throat but now as I enjoy my second glass without the ice you get more of the salt finish which is what makes this a really enjoyable drink."

3.75,"This is Voyage 17.

The nose is sweet and has cooked plumbs with baking spices, pear juice, sweet corn and a little oak. I also can’t deny that there is a brininess, even though I’m trying not to give into the whole “aged at sea” thing, it’s there. It is coming off kind of Scotchy.

The palate has a nice creamy and oily mouthfeel with some sweet corn, hints of red apple, baking spices, vanilla, som leather, oak and a little saltiness. There is a quick burst of a scotch type note at the beginning, I guess that’s the brininess coming through.

The finish is medium-long that has a very light burn that goes away fairly quickly. You’re left with notes of vanilla and a slight salty/bitterness on the front of the tongue.

Overall this makes for a fine bourbon. The salty/briny notes are there, not overwhelming, but present and make this reminiscent of Scorch. And I can’t help but also be reminded of Blanton’s and other Buffalo Trace mashbill #2 products. The sweet, smooth cooked apples and spices are what is reminding me of that. So if Blanton’s were a scotch, this is it."

1.5,"Sorry guys..... No saltiness should be in my bourbon.  A flat NO for me....

Why the hell did I pay 85 bucks for this ....*sigh*"
4.5,"I'm a big Scotch and Bourbon fan so OF COURSE I like this.  To make it simple, this bourbon has 2 things that sets it apart from many other bourbons: a heavily charred flavor and brine.  The weird thing is that it'd be hard to replicate these flavors naturally without a boat.  So, that's what makes this bourbon special.  It's very light and pretty which is not something I usually think of when I drink bourbon.  Bourbon is usually dark and rich.  If you're a Scotch-lover looking for a good bourbon? Get this.  If you're a bourbon-lover looking for a good Scotch? Get the Glenfiddich 14 Bourbon Barrel Reserve.  I'm not comparing these two in terms of flavor or richness or quality, just in terms of what they have to offer to people who like different styles of whiskies.  I really do recommend this whiskey...if you don't care about money.  It'll be hard for me to get another bottle because $75 is a lot of money for something like this.  For $49.99 I wouldn't bat an eye at all.  I just think this is one of the things where you're paying extra money for the story.  For me, the story is important, but the juice is what you're paying for."

4.5,"This is my official deep dive into Jefferson’s. Feel free to skip ahead to the tasting, because there are going to be a bunch of these cheesy intros, all copy/paste.
~~~~~~~~~~
Concept:

I walk into a liquor store and see like a billion different Jefferson’s bottles, yet my knowledge of them is minimal. My perception is that I typically don’t care for their stuff, but somehow, before choosing to start this experiment, I already had six different Jefferson’s on my shelf. How did they invade my house?
~~~~~~~~~~
Methodology:

Step 1: Jefferson’s Very Small Batch. Patient 0. Where it all started? Never had it, so a damn good place to start. This one was bought specifically for this experiment.

Step 2:  Jefferson’s VSB vs Jefferson’s Reserve (Very Old Very Small Batch). I already had this one. How did this get in my house?

Step 3: Jefferson’s VSB vs Jefferson’s Ocean. Is it a gimmick? Again, how did this get in my house?

Step 4: Jefferson’s Ocean standard vs Jefferson’s Ocean wheated mash bill.  Repeat house question.

Step 5: Finished Jefferson’s. I got rum, Sauternes, and Prichard Hill. Let’s do this.

Step 6: Blind taste test with all 7. Hell, throw in Chef’s Collaboration. (Seriously, how?) So there’s 8. Can I pick them out based on steps 1-5? Are there any standout Jefferson’s expressions, or is it all marketing? The stakes are so low, the tension is palpable. 
~~~~~~~~~~
Disclaimer: 

Starting this, I don’t much care for Jefferson’s in general. There’s this weird gummy-bear-ness that I can’t shake. Hoping to find my Jefferson’s product by the time this is over.
~~~~~~~~~~
Jefferson’s Ocean, aka “Step 3”

Is this a gimmick? This was one of my main questions coming into this experiment. I’ve been drinking this one side by side with Jefferson’s Very Small Batch over multiple days. I don’t have a drinking problem. I’m a scientist.

This is voyage 17, for those counting. And holy hell is this dark compared to the VSB.

If you really want to compare the noses of these guys, Glencairn is the way to go. They are related, but this one drops the leather and the nuttiness. It’s still very sweet and floral. I’m sticking with honeysuckle as the main takeaway, but there’s caramel and sugar too. Great nose.

The body is a different world. While solid for what it aims to do, Jefferson’s VSB is oily and entry level, very bottom-shelven in taste. Just made up a word, and I think I’m gonna keep it. This body is creamy and thick feeling, like milk. The flavors that stand out are simple, but well done. I get salt, caramel, cane sugar, and bitter chocolate. Well presented, very different from VSB, and special.

Finish is salty, but when combined with the residual chocolate you get a praline flavor. It’s phenomenal. The VSB cinnamon is there, but that praline note takes the cake for me.

Multiple times during this review, I had to make an effort to avoid being that guy. I was tempted on more than one occasion to say “sea salt” instead of “salt.” I weathered that storm. However, I’d be lying if I didn’t say that this really does make me reminisce about trips to the beach. Just sitting here now, at least 5 minutes since my last sip, I lick my lips and it reminds me of what it feels like lick your lips at the end of a long day swimming at the beach. I literally hate myself a bit for typing that just now, I’m just being honest with you fine people. According to their website, this magic is due to the motion of the ocean. Here’s the rub: could you accomplish the same flavors without traveling around in a boat, bumping into rubber duckies? I don’t see why not. I’ve had all these flavors before. Not trying to take away from the value of the product here, just pointing out that this whiskey is a strong performer in an existing flavor profile space. From a tasting note perspective, there’s nothing truly revolutionary here, even though this is a very delicious bourbon. Is there something about this sea-aged process that truly takes your mind back to the ocean, or is it merely the power of suggestion? I honesty don’t know, and I’m pissed off about that.

I still strongly dislike most Jefferson’s products I’ve tried. However, I like Jefferson’s VSB. Moreover, I freakin love this. I hate reviews that say, “this tastes like a warm, summer day.” But I’ll be damned if this doesn’t taste like a warm, summer day at the beach. I hate myself so much right now. Nonetheless... so far, this is my Jefferson’s. 

Is it a gimmick? Who the [email protected]% cares? It’s delicious. They could age a barrel in the trunk of a 2001 Ford Focus for all I care. If it tastes like this, I’m down.

Speaking of gimmicks: I liked this drink so much I bought a color-changing rocks glass that says Jefferson’s Ocean Aged at Sea. It turns light blue with ice. I have no regrets. Moreover, this gives me a chance to give notes on the rocks:

As expected, ice kills most of the nose. I can still get caramel and salt, with effort. The body has an amazing, even more creamy feel, and milk and chocolate take over. The body is very easy to drink and enjoyable this way. A praline finish is still there, but without the heat. On the rocks is very delicious with this bourbon.

Conspicuous problem: since voyage 17 is good, do I need to collect them all? My brain went there, and I immediately shut it down. The answer might be yes, but even though this product line is going to be a new permanent resident of my shelf, I simply don’t care enough to track down earlier voyages. I’m not going to spend my bourbon capital that way, and I don’t think those that do will see return on investment. I’d be interested to hear from a true Jefferson’s fan if I’m wrong there. Regardless, I absolutely will grab future voyages, should they pop up in my local stores. Like Booker’s, I strongly believe that these are made to drink, not hoard."

4.0,"Nose:
Vanilla, caramel, toasted coconut and a hint of pear.  Brown sugar and a hint of cinnamon buns.

Palate:
Milder than anticipated at first, growing into a fuller flavor.  Somewhat thin feeling in the mouth until the full flavor kicks in.  Very smooth and easy to drink.  Oak and dried fruit present up front transitioning into dark chocolate and vanilla notes  

Finish:
Expanding alcohol and flavor sensation.  Lingering vanilla and cocoa

Overall, well balanced and easy drinking.  Made my wife's Hallmark movie far more enjoyable!"
4.25,"Light color for a relatively mature bourbon. The nose screams salted caramel with an undercurrent of vanilla.  There isn't a real surprise over the pallet and the finish is smooth. It's very unique for how it is aged, how it has been produced and it brings some novelty with a cool story attached to each bottle. For the price point, I'd prefer something that is a little smoother but makes for a good story to share with a friend."
