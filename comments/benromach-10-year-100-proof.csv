4.0,"Røg meget behagelig. Alk procenten gør den skarp til at starte med, men den bliver derefter mere blød og rund"

3.5,"Nose is caramel pears vanilla and light smoke, cured meats

Palate is gingery peppery and a strong kick the abv takes no prisoners. Rich sherry 

Finish is medium and leathery with prolonged smoke 

The new version of this Batch 1 is superb and That’s probably effecting my rating here a little."

4.0,"This is a really enjoyable dram , initially a soft creamy texture with a sharpness st the finish. Sour apple , vanilla , fudge dried fruit hint of smoke on the pallet. Nose cloves , mixed spice a touch of smoke. I like the high ABV it seams to conceal some of the tasting notes at first but slowly reveals it over time. .  Fun and enjoyable expression."

4.0,"Nose: Chocolate, malt, hops, dry sherry, leather, subtle soft peat smoke, bracing oak tannin spices and chilli oil.

Palate: Neat - an astringent but oily arrival with lots of ginger spices, tannins and a rich malty presence. Considering the high abv it's not particularly burning at all. Honey, orange marmalade and white pepper on the development with a creamy caramel texture. With water - the arrival is sweeter and loses the high abv astringency, but otherwise is largely unchanged (unless it is over-watered).

Finish: Long, leathery and fading out into a delightful smoky orange aftertaste.

Adding a dash of water melds the nose together nicely and unleashes a torrent of bittersweet and hot spices on the palate. A generous pour softens everything but loses some character.  It swims well until it's out of it's depth, then it suddenly sinks.  I'd recommend sipping this one neat or with just a couple of drops.

A good whisky with plenty of character, but not my favourite Benromach. I found more complexity in the regular 10 year old (which is 43%abv).  This is essentially the same whisky at greater intensity, but for me the nuances were harder to appreciate here - both are 4 star whiskies.

Tasted from a 30 ml sample bottle.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"
