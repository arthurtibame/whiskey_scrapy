3.0,Hmm. Not really one for me. Quite an acidic sharper peat. One step down from the 16 year Port Askaig. Solid  3 I'll give it.

4.75,"I know i have been rating high scores lately, and it is because i bought a lot of samples of good renowned whiskies. This is not that case. 

I bought this full bottle simply because i loved the NAS version of Old Ballantruan, called ""the peated malt"". It is much better than the NAS, being almost a perfect 100 over 100. 

Bottled at 50%abv, with a deep gold color.

On the nose not complex but beautiful: PEAT, A LOT OF IT. butter and smoke. Simple but great. 

On the palate, spices, oranges, smoke, a mild but pleasant burn, clove, corn, very phenolic. Finish is so long, smokey and spicy, that makes your tongue to go to sleep. It never feels like a 50%abv dram, very smooth, very balanced. Amazing really.

Overall i give this a 98 over 100. Very very very recommended. Slaintè!"

4.5,"Deep and complex. Sharp and heavy at first but then it reveals its full sharm by enhancing the warmth and showing some mildness in character.
The nose is mid-peaty and a bit smoky, also some feebly-marked spirituous notes. The malt comes next and so do the various sweet notes (some honey, fresh red apples) but they are all secondary to the nose.
At first sip you get all the peatyness and the bonfire smoke but after comes the complex yet sweet taste of baked cake with apples or maybe a cheesecake. A handful of caramel, a bit of toffee. Fruits, a coating of chocolate, surely some citrus.
The aftertaste is not that gentle, it contains tons of smoke, peat and a bit of spices."
