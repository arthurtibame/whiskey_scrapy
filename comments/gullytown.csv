4.0,"Really nice for a upstart distillery at 2.5 years.  Barley single malt.  Initially barreled in new charred oak, then finished in used bourbon barrels from Breckenridge distillery.  Super smooth and pleasant.  Much more robust than a typical Irish.  A bit simple but enjoyable.  I get a bit of a grape/plum flavor and nose, like grappa."
