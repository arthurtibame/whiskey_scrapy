3.5,"Interesting - the buckwheat gives it a unique flavor.  I'm not a huge fan of rye whiskeys, and this is lot like a strong rye - spicy and bitter (although definitely not an astringic bitter).  There's also a strong note on the nose and palate that I can't place.  Perhaps it's a woody note, but it's different than any wood note I've experienced previously.  

Based on a previous comment, I spent time nosing the empty glass.  It was exceptional - a cross between caramel and campfire, which is odd, since I didn't get either on the palate.

I gave it a 3.5, because strikes me as a well crafted whiskey, even though it's not my favorite - too bitter. But I'd recommend it highly to rye lovers."
4.0,young but full. Sweet on the nose with a cereal finish.

4.0,"I like it! You can taste the buckwheat. It’s close to a rye, in the sense of being spicy and having a bite."
