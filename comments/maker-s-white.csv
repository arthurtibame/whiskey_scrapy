2.5,"This special new make is clear as filtered water and semi-thin semi-watery legs decorate the glass interior.

The nose is sweet, grainy, with notes of baking yeast, corn dust, mixed berries, chocolate, and ethanol.

The palate has a watery mouthfeel; the taste is sweet, clean, hiding a Twizzler candy note.

The finish is soft and mildly lingering."
