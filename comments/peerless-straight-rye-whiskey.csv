3.0,"Smells young and sweet, but balanced. On the palate, hard to believe this is 2 years old. Sweet, baking spices, bitter chocolate, some cherry, decent finish. You feel the proof but it still goes down smooth. Maybe hard to justify the price tag, but definitely makes you look forward to future offerings. 11/26/17"

4.0,"Compliments on the bottle design to Carson Taylor and the gang. 
Thoughts: 
Like Willett Rye on steroids, it viscous, and has the same green tea nose- with similar, but bigger and deeper sugary notes in the body. Worth the price. Very very good for 2 years."

4.0,"I have tasted my fair share of ryes, this is certainly one of the top ones on my list (but maybe not the best). 
Rye spices, caramel and cinnamon. Palate has more spicyness, nutmeg and cloves and licorice. A very long-lasting finish with more caramel and toffee and some  pepper, oak, and, of course, spice. Add a drop of water and the spiciness comes forward and then yields to the rich sweetness noted above. Fantastic rye all around. Can't wait to see what their bourbon will be like next year!"
5.0,Tasted at the distillery in November 2017 during a bourbon trail Long weekend. I could not believe this was a 2 year old rye whiskey. Great whiskey. The best whiskey we had all weekend. It is pricey for sure. Single barrel store pick I found was actually even better than barrel proof from the distillery.
null,"$110+ for a two year rye from an untested distillery. So it has come to this.

Note: 5/11 current notes for this come from accounts that have fewer than 5 notes and rate this as exceptional--one account gave WLW four stars and this five..."

4.75,"Has got to be in the top 3 ryes I've ever had. Perfectly balanced, there's a slight medicinal on the nose followed with some cedar and spice, brown sugar and cinnamon. Tasting gives way to lots of intricate flavors all perfectly balanced. Very smooth sweet vanilla ""creme brulee"" alongside the spicy rye and pepper notes. Didn't pick up too too much oak in this one, but it was there. Good mouthfeel too from what I can remember. Great, great bottle. If you can find it sub $100 it's worth it. Even over, I'd consider it anyday. Looking forward to their other future offerings."

4.0,"A fantastic (if not the best) rye whiskey. Notes of black pepper blend with the vanilla nicely to create a sweet and smooth finish. The question is though, is it worth the much higher price point than other ryes that may not be as good, but are still great for half the price? I have a hard time saying yes... but their bottle does look great on a shelf."

4.25,Maybe the best rye i’ve had.  Its special when compared to pilesville.  Its kinda like sazerac rye not in flavor profile but in being unique.  Sweet and smooth with a bit of spice at the end.  Very faint alcohol smell and taste.  Def taste better than its age(i tried a 3 yr store pick btw).  But that price tag makes my heart ache though.  Wished it was $50

3.0,"Fool me once shame on you.......

Well well Well, the controversial 2 year expensive juice. I have to say this is pretty good, however, the price should deter any potential buyers. It’s just not worth the buck-and-a-quarter price because there are PLENTY of other very good buys much cheaper. If it were in the $60 range I would say get a bottle. Regardless, I don’t regret spending what I did, I just won’t do it again. 3.2/5"
5.0,Barrel proof....yet very nice nose & pallet! So smooth....very drinkable!
3.5,"Look this is smooth and good, but it has no depth. Its super smooth, but just no bang, no pop, no nothing. Just smooth whiskey. Not special, not worth the $109 price tag"

3.5,"Improvement over the first tasting after this bottle was opened about six weeks. 

Nose: vanilla spice and yes corn. Hints of butterscotch and less of the funk from before, hints of biscuits and tea

Palate: quite rich and sweet, but hot on the mid palate, nutmeg, heavy spice on the end 

 Finish: rye kicks it up a notch along with the proof for significant warmth, still rich and bright

The nose is fantastic now but toward the finish it gets a bit muddled. Will check in with it later."

4.25,"I approached this whiskey with a heavy dose of skepticism given the juxtaposition of its high cost and low (2 year) age statement. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised and now count myself a Peerless convert. With a few minutes in the glass, the nose unfolds from an initial hit of ethanol into rich vanilla, dried apricots, orange oil, roasted peanuts, toffee, a light note of mint, and balanced with a bit of sweet coffee. The palate is immediately sweet and rich with vanilla, graham crackers, toasted sugars, allspice, a light grassy-herbal note, a very light caramel, honey roasted peanuts, and a very pleasant malty note, before transitioning to a warm, slightly herbal, vanilla-laden exhale. Further sips bring out more rich sweetness with a stronger note of dried apricots, powdered sugar, and an extremely pleasant bit of spice and fiery burn. Not a super complex whiskey, but an extremely pleasant and all around impressive offering from Peerless. I look forward to continuing to try their rye as it ages."

4.0,"This one was interesting. Very forward with the notes. Though as I nosed and tasted later in, I could pick out more.
I let this one breath for about 10mins or so before I took a sip. And I will say, when I went for a 2nd pour, I couldn’t taste as much as I could with the pour that had breathed for a bit.

The nose is a little vanilla, mint, green apple
The palate is a little sweet, and slight leather, that leads to a spicyness that you expect from a rye. A good amount of spice.
The finish has the spices burn on the back of the throat.
It’s a good whiskey that is hard to believe it’s only two years old. Letting it breathe is the key I think. Adding a little water diluted it too much.

Got the 200mL bottle before I splurged in the big boy. We’ll have to see how the rest of the bottle goes before I decide to if I think the price is worth it. It’s good and somewhat unique though."

2.0,"Yeah FOMO got the best of me, so I forked out $24 ($29 minus $5 reward cert) at TW to try this 2 yr old Rye (200 ml bottle). Is it possible that a Rye that young could live up to it's $125 price tag? Would the 107 entry proof, sweet mash process and micro batch really make up for it's youth... Let's dive in:

Sampling this rye neat it definitely comes across as hot and young. Ethanol, pine, anise and some herbal funk. Not really something that I enjoy. I quickly make the decision to drop a small ice cube to see if I can tame this and bring out some better notes. That did the trick to a certain extent calming the herbal notes and bringing forth some sweet notes (brown sugar and candy corn). Finish lingers and is filled with more of an alcohol burn. In short this one falls way short of a full bottle purchase and to be honest I don't know that it's worth $24 to try it. Just not my profile. 

Cheers all and Happy Halloween!"

4.25,This is amazingly good for a two year rye. Very sweet on the front with that rye on the back. Almost reminds me of a toasted finish Michters or a Willet family estate rye. Moderate to long finish. I would buy even at 100 bucks.

4.0,"very unique nose and taste.  the most pure rye nose and flavor I've ever had.  bright rye on first taste but finished with fresh rye bread which was delightful.  small glimpse of spearmint but it wasn't overtaking the rye bread.  great rye but not sure I would pay $100 to have in my collection.  For 60 or less,  absolutely!"

Nose: sour cream notes....a little musty. Not much else and not approachable.  

Palate: much better than the nose, that’s for sure. Sweet grass, oak, spices. A little briny. 

Finish: pretty fast considering this is barrel strength 

Will have to come back to this. Something funky going on here."

4.0,"Nose: Big fruity notes of cherry and peach subside into a vanilla/cinnamon cream.  Reminds be of a cherry or peach cream cheese danish!  Underneath that breakfast pastry base is a a sour oak and rye note that is hard to identify - kind of like wet wood.

Palate: Sweet and oily on the tongue.  Big bursts of cinnamon, clove, and vanilla cream.  There is a surprising large wood influence for such a young whiskey.  There's just the slightest hint of that classic rye herbal note that I usually find offputting, but it's dialed back enough for me to really enjoy this. 

Finish:  Rather lengthy and sweet.  The dominating notes are of vanilla and caramel.  A little corn dust and leather creep in toward the end along with an unmistakable pecan flavor.

Conclusion:  I've found another rye I actually enjoy!  I like the spicy breakfast pastry flavors it reminds of quite a bit.  It's a bit pricy for the liquid inside, but I'd buy it if I found a deal."
3.0,"Read a bunch of notes while tasting, and wondered if I was tasting the same whiskey. I get sweet corn, rye bread, heat, hint of mint, and pine on the nose. A sip delivers sweet spices to the front of the tongue, transitioning to grainy corn and rye notes, fading to anise and spearmint. A healthy dose of heat throughout, unfortunately it tends to amplify the graininess on the mid palate.

Honestly, $100 for a rye pour that fails to deliver a bonafide rye punch, lacks the complexity of a more mature product, and really fails to differentiate itself from a sea of average $20-$35 ryes on the market is laughable to me. Grateful that I got this as a sample, and did not have to spend the coin to be this disappointed. Maybe when this is an 8-9 year product it MIGHT be worth the asking price.

Until then, it’s a hard pass for me. I’ll gladly buy 2 bottles of Pikesville, or any number of lower priced MGPs, or even step up to a Kentucky Owl."

Spicy front to back in the mouth with a backing of caramel, vanilla, and sugar that keeps the spice mellow. Very little kick despite 108 proof. Taste lingers after swallow. Smooth and easy to drink but continually brings me back for new flavors, particularly on the nose. Plus, the bottling is gorgeous. I got mine at a steal, $55/bottle for a barrel select. I tasted while there and elected to get 2 bottles. Not sure I’d pay asking for it, but for what I paid, it’d be an instant buy."
