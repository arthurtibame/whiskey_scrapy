Nose: Sweet smoke and caramel. Burnt sugars. Not a heavy alcohol presence on the nose. 
Palate: Sweet smoke comes through on taste. Not very briny. Notes of honey and barbecue."

null,"February 18, 2017 at The Irish Heather Gastropub. Actually we tried (not listed on this app) the Kilchoman ‘Sauternes’ 2016. 

$35/dram in house 

Kilchoman is a small farm distillery on Islam and is one of the newest In Scotland having been founded in 2008 yet it’s already winning awards. Hot on the heels of a sought after ‘club bottling’ in 2015 - they released this - their first general release of a Sauternes cask matured whiskey.
Sauternes is a limited production French sweet wine produced in Bordeaux from white grapes with a higher sugar concentration do you to naturally occurring Noble rot"
4.0,A great expression coming out of this distillery. Vanilla and oak pair wonderfully with nuttiness. Very complex and delicious.

5.0,"This is A LOT better than the 2014 version. This is a nice earthy Lagavulin-like peat. The nose brings bright oranges, vanilla, salted pretzels, mango, jasmine, and peat smoke. The palate is fantastic, even neat, and brings barbecue, creme brulee, bakery pastry, almonds, marzipan, cashews, peanut brittle, smoky peat, white grapes, pear, candied apples, caramel, and molasses. Sheesh it's damn good. Long finish and a heavy mouth coat, so what are you waiting for? 4.75 ... only age would make this better. The theme to this dram should be a masterpiece, but powerful. ""Heaven and Hell"" by Black Sabbath will work."
4.0,"In my personal humble opinion, Kilchoman is one of the rare few distilleries that I’ve consistently ranked either a 4 or 5 star.  I think aside from Springbank, Ardbeg, Yoichi, Yamazaki and Lagavulin, there really isn’t another that just time after time performs up there.  Thanks to @LeeEvolved, I got to try this Islay beauty.  Lee, I know you’ll disapprove, but I had to pull a @Generously_Paul and add water.  Was way too intense for me otherwise.  With water, nose is quite interesting; marzipan, engine grease, seaweed.  Fresh and vibrant.  Palette comes alive with salted kippers ( herring that’s smoked over wood chips).  Peppery finish, not hot, but like sishito peppers.  Another solid 4 star performer for me.  Thanks Lee! ( on a side note, Kilchoman just came out with their portwood edition...will be interesting to see the effect of sweet port to its briny style)."
