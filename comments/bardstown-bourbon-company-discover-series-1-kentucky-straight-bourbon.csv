4.0,"Mild nose, at least initially. Fresh linens. Cola on the palate, with herbs and caramel. Good spice. Sweet yes, but the finish goes between sweet and dry, interesting. Fantastic. 9/2/19"

2.0,"A sample from dthom as part of the ""Whiskey transfer program"".

Nose: Vanilla, brown sugar, citrus, and a lot of odd earthy notes going on here.  Heavy mint and baking spices on the nose.  Kind of a weird combination that I found a little off putting.

Flavor: More sweet classic bourbon notes and still heavy black pepper, mint, and baking spices.  

Finish: Oaky and drying, medium length, heavy mint and black pepper again with some ethanol punch.

Honestly I wanted to like this but I keep getting an aftertaste that is a little bit like toothpaste that I couldn't get past."

4.25,Big bold bourbon. Opens with some heat but is replaced by a syrupy carmel and spice.

4.0,This is good. Strong vanilla and maple syrup. Moderate finish. Nice bourbon. Not sure it is worth the price.

3.0,"Oak, vanilla, spice, herbal and floral undertones, medium finish, tanic. This is a very sweet corn heavy bourbon but it also has a spicy kick to it. It’s not as well balanced as I would have liked but it still is an interesting one. 12yr old."

3.5,"Great nose with caramel, vanilla, oak. Taste on the front end is a bit spicy with the vanilla coming through but all in all it was too hot for me. Even with a few drops of water it never seemed to mellow"

3.0,"Definitely has some oomph to it.  Consistent burn from start to finish.  Smoky with some caramel undertones.  At its best slightly chilled, when the blending of the whiskeys makes the flavor profile more complex.  Decent, but definitely not worth the price."
