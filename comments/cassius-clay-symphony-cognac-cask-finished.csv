1.5,"So a new bourbon and given how much I LOVE the sherry, I had to get this one. 

Nose - Dill, butter, young oak, sweets, some kind of darker sweetness, burned caramel. It's good. A word of advice, this has taken a while to open up at first, meh. 

Taste - Buttery and oaky and yes sweet. The whisky comes off young, it starts to take on a beam like nutty profile but I think that's the cognac cask and that's sad as normally they give off so much more flavor. I fear they've just gotten some bad barrels for this. 

Overall I hope this opens up as this is a neck pour and I'll back and modify if so but overall this is not good bourbon. It's not bad but there's not much going on here other than some off notes and it's a bit overly hot. yeah, I'm a hard pass on this. 

1 star because it's still quality bourbon but there's nothing good going on here and the price is brutally high for the results. 

Bottle is now dead, there was a night it was working for me on friday or saturday. Anyway the casking developed and improved with some air. I ended up liking it a bit more with that. I still think this was a bit underwhelming, especially for the price, but I'm much more favorable on it. I somewhat wish I'd not finished it just to have it around. Oh well the shelf space is nice to have too."
