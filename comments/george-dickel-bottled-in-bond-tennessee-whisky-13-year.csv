5.0,Great juice.  Aged 13yrs.  Easy drinking 100 proof whiskey.  Doesn’t have the typical sour mash taste that comes with the dickel 12

5.0,"Smooth! Take this BIB neat.  My first sip I did taste the charcoal but it gave way to a deep leather and chocolate finish.  It has a bold flavor but does not have an alcohol burn at all, did I mention smooth."
4.75,This is spicy wonderfulness.  Grab it when you find it.

5.0,"Maybe one of the best bourbons i have ever had, starts off with some pepper and moves into leather and caramel, it does not have the typical burn of a 100 proofer. I anticipate this stuff being as hard to find as some of the Buffalo Trace products. Went back to get another bottle to make sure I had another in case this stuff is more limited of a distribution."

4.0,"I'm usually not a huge fan of Tennessee whiskey, but man, this was a good buy.

Nose: The charcoal mellowing works extremely well with the proof and aging here. I get a light of sweetness with some undertones of smoke. Slightly toasted marshmallow, brown sugar, banana, vanilla...It's like a smoked banana's foster that isn't too heavy on the banana. 

Taste: The proof hits hard. There are some spikes with alcohol burn in the beginning and end, but it doesn't overwhelm the sweet flavors (again, vanilla and banana) along with some of the woodiness that comes with the aging. A little char, as well along with some aromatic tobacco, cherry and apple.

Finish: Sticks with you. Gives you a nice burn, but never evolves into anything unpleasant. Oily enough to coat and keep giving you some fruity flavors (cherry for me) even 10 seconds after a sip.

Value: At $35, this is a definite buy for me. It's probably one I'll continue to keep in my collection as long as it stays sub $40. You get a good proof and flavor profile. 

Overall: 90. You get an accessible, daily drinker with enough oomph to hold up in cocktails.  This was truly a pleasant surprise, and a damn good value for me."

4.5,"Sweet, nutty and a bit of caramel flavor profile with a moderate lingering ""Kentucky Hug"". Mouthfeel is on thinner side but is still there.  It has the usual Dickel vitamin smell to it, which I don't mind.
Good enough to enjoy neat but I cut mine with ice.  Not a top shelf $$$ whisky, but a great value at $35."
3.75,"Funky smell for sure. Tennessee whiskey sweetness coming through. Not much else. No oak for 13 years. Pretty smooth though. Funky finish

3 months of air time: you can tell that sweetness wants to shine but there’s like a earthy, dirt taste that overcomes it. Honestly, it might be oak comin through"
3.5,"Find #2 of my SoCal trip! This is yet another Whiskey that is slowly rolling out nationwide and I would anticipate will be harder to find than the Four Roses as it comes with a lot more hype. This one is already allocated in Southern California and I had to hunt a bit to track it down. 
I am especially excited to have found it for just $37 (SRP is $36 but it's already selling for double that). I was also interested to compare it against a 13yr old old scout SiB that was sourced from Dickel. That one I paid $65. 
So we are getting a 13 yr old bottled at 100 proof in Bond from a respectable Distillery for $37??? Sounds to good to be true right? Let's dive in to find out:
On the palatte it's classic Dickel. Lots of roasted nuts, caramel and maple syrup with a hint of spice. Some apricots on the mid palette with a dash of toffee leading to a fairly long oak driven finish with a hint of nice old leather. Some back end heat to boot. 
It's a nice, easy sipping Whiskey. However, it's not special or overly complex. Not knowing anything about the Whiskey and tasting it blind, I would peg it as a $40 Whiskey. It's nicer than the 12 and Single Barrel Selects, but not by much. Also, you have to be a Dickel fan to like this one because the flavor profile really doesn't stray too much. 
So in summation, nice Whiskey. Decent value but not really worth more than the price of admission. 
Cheers all!"
4.0,"A very nutty sweet dusty nose. The palate is also nutty with dark fruit notes, it’s also got quite a bit of wonderful spice. The finish is medium in length, with nuttiness and sweetness throughout

Overall a very good dram"
1.5,Heavy corn taste. Some nuttiness and a hint of licorice or maybe cough syrup. It’s just not for me
3.5,null
2.5,Very sharp on the nose. Hints of black cherry. And can taste the corn on the aftertaste.
4.0,"Just came to my area, first try (always drink It neat) very impressed.  Haven’t had a lot of Tennessee whiskeys but this is a steal for $35 at a 13 year bottled in bond.  Get a little of the vitamin/ mineral/fruity pebbles taste
 but it’s nice.  On top of that there is great balance of oak with nice cream brûlée, cinnamon, peppery finish.  Look forward to seeing how this one opens up over next couple of weeks.    

Has opened up a lot, not so much of the vitamin taste initially, has smoothed out quite nicely.  This bottle is gone have already bought a couple more."
4.5,"I was looking forward to this and finally found one today. Beautiful color, intense aroma upon opening...With a few swirls it captivates you caramel corn, maple syrup, spices and nice oak background. The taste pretty much the same as the aforementioned notes but with a terrific mouth coating viscous feel that has a medium long finish. Well done whisky from GD...Easy sipping, 14 year old , 100 Proofer...Cheers!"

4.25,"Nice to see something that’s a decent price, limited availability actually, tastes great and has sat on a shelf for more than 10 minutes. This hit shelves a couple weeks ago near me and I think I’m the only one who has bought one so far. I shouldn’t even post this because the goobers around here will buy it all after sharing it all over their Facebook whiskey groups. Hopefully this one lasts at my local store for a while because I’ll be buying more at this price."

4.0,"Nose is upfront minerals, followed my mellow sweetness of corn and maple syrup. The palate is peppery, with dark fruits, vanilla, and caramel. A very nice finish that lingers. I love it."
3.5,Similar to JD but with a longer finish. Nice warm feeling in the chest.
4.75,"This finally hit NC. As a fan of all things Cascade Hollow, this has been my most anticipated release this year. Let's see if it lives up to my expectations. It pours into the Glencairn with an amber tending toward orangish hue. After a quick swirl, it takes forever to form small slow moving legs. 
NOSE: You are immediately hit with Corn and that trademark Flintstone Chewable Vitamin Note, but both of those fade rather quickly to be replaced by Strong Barrel Charred Oak, Vanilla, Sugary Confections like Candy Corn or Marshmallow, and Grilled Fruit (maybe Peach and Pineapple?). The longer it sits the better it gets, eventually picking up a savory note of Smoked Pork. This is a bold nose. The notes aren't subtle, they are definitely in your face. Oddly, if the usual banana note is there, I'm completely missing it.
NEAT: Thick and Clingy. Again, Bold is the key word here. Not overly complex at first, dominated by Oak Tannins. Subsequent sips bring notes of Syrupy Fruit (like one of those fruit cocktail cups), those Wet Walnuts that you top ice cream with, Vanilla and more slightly Bitter Oak. Slightly drying finish with just the right amount of heat. It is very clingy and your tongue is coated with the Syrupy Fruit and Charred Oak that hangs on well past the time that you're ready for another sip giving the flavor a building or cumulative effect. The more you drink, the better it gets. Again, the banana note so prevalent in the 12 presents more as fruit cocktail with the extra age. 
SPLASH: A few drops of water changes the fruit on the nose to Fruity Pebbles Cereal (what is it with Dickel and the Flintstones?). Brings a little more balance to the palate by reducing the Bitter Tannins and accentuating the Sweeter Oak Notes. The Syrupy Fruit Note remains, now joined by a hint of Mint. The nose on the empty glass was amazing. All gooey caramel, burnt sugar and baked apples. 
VERDICT: A little overwhelming at first, but spend some time with it and man does it deliver. As expected for thirteen years, very oak driven but some water removes the bitter tannins if they do not agree with your palate. The sweet notes combined with the thick clingy character would make this a perfect post dinner pour. All of that for $36. Dickel has hit a homerun with this one, and I'm hoping there are more reasonably priced releases on the way from Cascade Hollow."

3.75,"George Dickel Bottle In Bond is just a hint darker than the George Dickel 12. I would think it would be darker since it is a 13 year old whiskey. It has a smell caramel and corn and some alcohol aroma. The mouthfeel is definitely better. The taste is of caramel and corn with brown sugar. The finish is medium. 
It goes down very easy even though it is 100 proof, it seems as smooth as the George Dickel 12. It does have that trademark mineraly taste that many do not like, but I do. If you like the regular George Dickel 12 you will certainly like the Bottle in Bond version. This is an amazing bargain at 36 bucks for a 100 
proof whiskey."

4.5,Robust sweetness. One of the best values out there.
4.0,"The standard Dickel bottle only with the bright blue background label is already a bit of a punch to the nose, this is no Dickel you've ever seen. 

Found for the MSRP of 36USD, while it isn't allocated in GA,, YET, it also isn't universally available either, as some of the larger stores hadn't gotten it in yet. Having let this ""open"" for a few days I believe it's putting out an even sweeter profile on the nose.

So how sweet is that nose? Really sweet, damn sweet, awesomely sweet, what a great reminder of just how sweet a bourbon-whiskey can be without actually adding it after the fact.  Speaking of sweet, while I don't normally pay much attention to it, this one is a nice deep, rich amber ""honey"" color, appropriately enough, and glazes the glass with a thick coat that beads after some seconds.

Nose: Rich sweet, honey-corn sugar is huge and bold, some feint red fruit sugars, all spice, butter and salt, remarkably smooth and almost alcohol free for being a BiB dram.   Letting this juice open up for 48 hours with a little O2 in the bottle is a definite plus.

Front:  All that corn sweetness lands first, hints of dark spice come in with a wave of salted, buttered garden corn and butterscotch-toffee.  While some may detect fruit jam sugars and other notes, for me the well buttered and salted sweet corn is so in your face it doesn't leave room for much else.

Finish: The buttered corn and salt linger on whispering the words ""I'm G.A. Dickel, now have another sip"".  Any harsh barrel tannins are appropriately reduced to salt that complements the buttered corn profile so perfectly it simply disappears on the night air.

I can safely say this is the smoothest 100 proofer I've had since the Col Taylor SiB, finding a BIB strength whiskey this smooth is not something that happens every day and I'm going to mark up appropriately for that fact.  Also getting a well aged liquor for such a reasonable price has to be factored as well, this is really a gift from the Dickel Distillery.    Sure you can complain about the lack of complexity and I get that,  this isn't going to knock Little Book or GTStagg off their perch, but like the standard Dickel products, it has a lot to say for itself by staying true to it's roots while offering so much.

Well thought out and well done by Nicole Austin and the folks at Cascade Hollow."
4.75,"Strong bright and toasty/nutty, warms you the whole way down."
3.75,null
3.25,"A sample from dthom as part of the ""Whiskey transfer program"".  

Nose: Very mild nose.  Vanilla, shortbread cookies, brown sugar, cereal notes that smell a lot like corn flakes, very sweet pear scents, 

Flavor: More of what I got in the nose.  Poached pear, vanilla, brown sugar, some charred oak, and then gone and right in to the finish.  Very thin mouth feel.

Finish:  Some spice with charred wood notes, and barrel spices.  Short finish with no super strong flavors coming through.

I liked this but wouldn't seek it out.  Not as much flavor as I'd like from a 100 proof whiskey probably due to the charcoal filtering.  I can see this being a good whiskey for making cocktails if it weren't $40 per bottle."
2.5,This reminds me what Whiskey tasted like when I was a teen in 1980. This is also why I did not drink whiskey as my liquor of choice for 25 years. 🙁

2.0,"Vanilla, orange, and lemon on the nose, with a little note of cinnamon on the tail end. In the mouth this whiskey is oily and thick, and it floods the tongue with oak and black peppercorn. A fair amount of heat on the finish-this pour sips like it is closer to 115proof. If you find that you like this bottle it’s a killer value-a 13 year BiB for sub-$40."

4.5,"Well I have been passing by this bottle at my liquor store quite a few times just thinking it was probably just like Dickel 12, but with a blue label and BIB. WELL I was very surprised to find out this is aged 13yrs. Rich and deep flavors with dominate older oak, this one tastes like it has the extra age. Nice medium mouthfeel and just very satisfying to sip neat. Of course this has the trademark vitamin taste, but I think it tastes less like Flintstones, and just a general vitamin taste here. I find this vitamin taste more in the background verses #12 and its fine with me. I bought this bottle for $40 and its well worth it."
3.0,"Nose of baking spices and char... Taste, pretty much the same, with the addition of black pepper. Fair burn the whole way through. Not the worst, or the best BIB, but for the price, I expected more..."
4.25,"The nose on this one immediately reminded me of jelly bellies popcorn flavored jellybeans! So it has an artificial buttered popcorn thing going on (which I like) as well as raisins. 

The palate has sweet corn, caramel, cola and oak. It has a nice thicker coating mouthfeel 

The finish is medium in length with lingering sweet corn and cola.

I’m really enjoying this. The corny-ness takes center-stage throughout. It’s very nice and unique."
3.5,"Sweet corn, maple syrup and oak on the nose. More sweet corn and oak on the grainy palate with some mineral notes. The medium finish reprises the sweet corn with a hint of heat. A splash of water brought out the Dickel children's vitamins on the nose and palate."

4.5,"Nose: Rich toasted oak, brown sugar, vanilla.  There's a fruity quality - banana, peach, cherry.  Cream, honey.  Rye spice poking its head through - mostly as dried thyme and basil.  Tannic and bitter, but in a very appealing way.

Palate: Toasted oak, vanilla, sugar.  Peaches and cream.  Warm bread.  Honeyed bananas.  Fig Newtons.  Dried basil and thyme again, maybe a hint of oregano.  Persimmon.  Floral, perfume-y quality buried in the finish.  Tannin creates an appealing drying quality.

Other notes: I don't re-review things so quickly, but I figured this deserved a second look after having tasted it while my palate was shot.  Slightly different notes this time around, but my impression is largely the same - this stuff is quite good.  The sheer amount of time invested in barrel shows up in some really wonderful ways.  Not mad at all about this, especially given SRP.  Well executed."

4.5,"Nose: Oak, brown sugar, figs.  Nutmeg, allspice, clove.  Freshly baked whole wheat bread.  Deep toasted grain - the rye and barley are showing up to the party.  There's a buried candy sweetness that reminds me almost of classic bubble gum, which is usually banana, strawberry, and cherry.  Toasted nuts - peanut, walnut, cashew, which gives way to an almost rich, BBQ meat thread.  Think pork shoulder or brisket.

Palate: Cherry, brown sugar, charred oak.  Tannin - the mouthfeel that develops after a sip is showcasing the age here.  The rye makes it through to the taste, again as allspice and nutmeg.  There are the toasted nuts again, this time as almonds and peanuts.  Barley is buried here.  Slight cinnamon.  Luxardo maraschino cherries, banana.  Moderate finish that fades ""bottom-up"" in that the more rich, foundational characteristics fade away first, then the mid-palate ""body"" goes, and then the fruit lingers for a bit.

Other notes: My palate is a little wonk right now - had a big bowl of spicy ramen for lunch, which is likely distorting things a bit here.  Overall, though, this is a well executed bottle.  The price/age/quality ratio here is pretty excellent.  Worth a buy to see what the hype is all about."
3.75,"So this just won Whiskey Advocate's Whiskey of the Year.  Of course I had to check it out (I am an awards whore, dammit it all).  VA ABC just started getting this, I had to order a bottle from the warehouse and then no one at the store was familiar with it, and asked for a report after tasting.

Bottle poured neat in Glencairn at home.  Breezy joined me for the occasion.  Nose does have the buttered popcorn and hint of Flintstones vitamins that other reviewers note, but with the vanilla and caramel followed by spice, it works.  Taste has more butter immediately followed by baking spice, then some mild heat comes on, followed by the vitamin and butter again.  Quite interesting, and very drinkable.  Though I do agree that more than a couple drams at a time would be too much, too oily and medicinal on the palate.  Overall - no, this is not the whiskey of the year, but it is definitely the best Dickel I have had, by a wide margin.  12/12/19."

3.5,"BACKGROUND: Perhaps no recent event has resulted in as much vehement anger and division among bourbon aficionados as Whisky Advocate magazine’s decision to name George Dickel 13-Year Bottled-in-Bond as its 2019 “Whisky of the Year”

Almost immediately, some consumers and Dickel detractors claimed that the magazine’s decision was somehow “fixed” or intended as a reciprocal payback to spirits giant Diageo in return for the significant advertising dollars they spend within the publication’s pages.

Whisky Advocate Executive Editor Jeffery Lindenmuth, though, has noted that all of the magazine’s tastings are conducted on a blind basis, and tasting coordinator Ted Simmons does not even tell participants what kind of whisky they are tasting (bourbon, scotch, Japanese, Irish, etc.), much less what brand.

For a brief period following the magazine’s announcement, the Dickel 13-Year BiB was difficult to locate on store shelves in some areas, and various retailers were reported to have temporarily doubled the $35.99 retail price in response to the demand and curiosity.  After conducting their own tastings, most independent Internet bloggers and YouTubers scratched their heads at the Whisky of the Year crowning and few, if any, agreed.

When initially released in May of 2019, the 13-Year BiB was marketed as the first significant innovation of recently-hired Dickel distiller Nicole Austin, who said:

 “We wanted George Dickel Bottled in Bond to be rooted in authenticity, quality and truth, reflective of the values we feel are most important when making Tennessee’s finest whisky. The aged whisky stocks we have access to here at Cascade Hollow are absolutely beautiful, and it’s important to me that we create whisky that’s sure to be a great value for the quality you’re getting.”

The bourb…er, I mean Tennessee whisky. . .has a mash bill of 84% corn, 8% rye and 8% malted barley. It is chill charcoal mellowed by filtering it through sugar-maple charcoal like the rest of the George Dickel Tennessee Whisky portfolio
In addition to the ""Whisky of the Year"" nod, George Dickel Bottled in Bond earned a score of 95 on a scale of 100 from Wine Enthusiast Magazine and also took home a Gold medal at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition.

NOSE: George Dickel 13-Year BiB presents a wholly unique and memorable nose that includes scents of cornbread, oak, nuts, and pipe tobacco.  The smell of Flintstones chewable vitamins that is commonplace in Dickel products, and one I oddly enjoy, is firmly present, as well.  (Note: Spirits writer Fred Minnick attributes the oft-mentioned Flintstones smell to the yeast strain that Dickel uses in its fermentation tanks.)

PALATE: Caramel, bananas, and oak dominate the palate.  Cherries and a difficult-to-classify flavor more attributable to dark rum than to bourbon are present, as well.  The mouth feel is both thin and oily, if that is possible.  The palate is as distinct - or perhaps “quirky” is a better word - as the nose.

FINISH: The finish is quite drying and tannic, but if I had spent 13 years encased in oak, I would likely be drying and tannic, too.  An abundance of vanilla is present in the finish.  Oddly, the heat in the finish is somewhat delayed, but once it gets kickstarted, it keeps going for a significant period.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: The George Dickel 13-Year BiB offers a memorable tasting experience.  I enjoy heavily oaked bourbons, and this one certainly fits the bill, but it is significantly more drying than most.  Because of its uniqueness, I would not recommend this whisky as a daily sipper, but it is certainly worthy of being kept on hand and consumed whenever the mood for something “different” strikes."

-Aroma is low but inviting (no alcohol smell)
-Great Oak flavor. Would love to drink by campfire
-Finish is very nice, and lasts"
4.0,"I enjoyed a bit of this last night, neat in a Glencairn.  It followed an EHT Small Batch and comparing the two was quite interesting.  Since I didn't find anything new, here are my notes from my comparo between the Dickel BiB and JD Old No. 7 published on the Bourbon Sippers Slurred Speech blog - https://bourbonsippers.com/george-dickel-bottled-in-bond/

This whiskey pours a rich, rose-brass coloration.  

On the nose, I get caramelized sugar, oak, and barrel char.  It’s got some interesting things going on.

On the tongue, the proof of the Dickel is readily apparent.  There is a nice bite and an engaging strength. The mouthfeel is creamy, almost oily.  The oak barrel notes are forward without overpowering the flavor; no small thing for a whisky this old.  I find it to be beautifully balanced. The flavor palate includes cherry cola, bananas, dark rum, cinnamon, and white pepper. There are notable banana and rum notes, reminiscent of a Bananas Foster dessert. 

The finish is nicely tapered sweet, and warming. 

I'm on my 4th bottle of this, so its safe to say I like it a lot.  I'm happy I have a couple in the cupboard as this is getting somewhat hard to find.  Thanks to Kenny's Liquors in Tampa for holding true to the price!

What I'm not really happy about are the local liquor stores here in Tampa that thought jacking up the price from an already over MSRP $39.99 to $69,99 right after it was announced that this expression was 2019 Whiskey of the year., was a good idea. It's a bullshit move and I hope you'll join me in refraning from shopping at stores that pull these kinds of unnecessary pricing shenanigans."
4.5,"Taste:  2 oz neat in glen cairn.

Nose:  (4.0) Caramel and honey are front and center.  There is a bit of that signature vitamin thing but not enough to define it.  Just enough to stamp it as being Dickel.  The nose is not all that complicated and may seem a bit muted.  My chief complaint is that I want more of it!

Palate: (4.75)  vanilla, raisin, maple syrup and a drizzle of caramel.  The taste is rich, creamy, and coating with little to no ethanol at 100 proof.  Absolutely no Dickel/Flintstone Vitamins.  Think a rich, decadent, boozy bread pudding.

Finish (4.5):  Reminds me of bit-o-honey candy.  It is long lasting and delicious.

Overall:  Is it the whiskey of the year......it is in my top 5 and might be in top 3.  What really draws me to this is the rich, creamy feel that matches the richness.  I for one don't get off put by the signature vitamin taste.....but this doesn't really have that except on the nose.  Some will put this on blast for being *Tennesee Whiskey.  To that I say --lose the prejudice!  This is damned good stuff.  If you were to factor in the low price this is a 5."

3.5,"Wow. Disappointed this was rated #1 whiskey in 2019. Not available in PA I found it in FL. What a waste of time, who were the tasters? They must never had a decent whiskey or Bourbon before. WTF. 

I found this a fair whiskey no great taste or defect slight aroma of vanilla with hints of vanilla in the taste but they are short lived with strong alcohol  rasp middle to end of the taste. 
Disappointed. 
So much for the experts. ☹️"

3.0,"In two words: Bananas Foster.  

A lot of banana notes jump out at the beginning but then transition to an iced banana bread / pound cake flavor.   

Very good and even better when paired with some chocolate but would not be an every day sipper.  Very unique and great to share but I would not buy another bottle."
4.0,"Light fruity nose. Palate leads with fruit followed with pepper, ending with pie dough. Fairly mild. The more I sip this the more I like it."

4.25,"I snagged this when it was first released in NC, which turned out to be good fortune because I haven't seen these bottles on the shelves since. Before I dive into the notes I have to say a 13-year old 100 proof American whiskey is an incredible value at $36. Can you imagine what the other prominent Tennessee distillery would charge for whiskey this old? $75? $100? Moving on.

I had George Dickel No. 12 before purchasing this, and one of the big differences is the corn dust/cereal nose/taste is tampered way way down in the BiB. Due to its age, I get a lot of sweet oak and black pepper on the nose with muted corn dust. I also get hints of tobacco and dark fruit. 

I get more spice on the taste besides black pepper, but the corn and oak make this distinct from a lot of bourbons I like that lean more heavily into sweet dessert spices. Despite its age and proof, this whiskey avoids being harshly tannic. The oak flavor is sweet and smooth on the way down. I get more corn dust on the finish, reminding me this is a George Dickel product. Overall I think this is a fantastic addition to the market and an unbelievable value. If you see it, pick it up because I'm guessing it will always be in demand."

4.0,Best served cold. Possible with o e big ice or 1 small one and drank quickly. The nose is certainly unique lots of mixed candies best way to describe.   Drinks really well. Low heat. Nice mouth feel. I might call it a bourbon candy liquid. I m a big fan. Delicious. I’m curious to see how I feel when it’s the first dram if the night not the last (like tonight). :)
4.0,"I am surprised everytime I drink this whisky. It is a little hot, but add a little water or a piece of ice, and it smooths out, allowing the brilliant vanilla flavors to shine though. It' not Old Forester 1920, but for $36, it is a terrific buy."
3.75,"Nose: sweet tobacco, spanish cedar, fruitcake, hints of peanut

Taste: caramel vanilla sweetness transitions to a leather and black pepper. Oily mouthfeel leads to a long finish.

I was not impressed with this when I initially bought it, but after letting it sit and open up for a couple of weeks it is really impressive."
4.25,"As there will always be lovers and haters especially when one receives #1 from Whiskey Advocates Top 20 of any given year
2018 #1 • Nikka From the Barrel - I enjoy
2017 #1 • Elijah Craig Barrel Proof B51 - I most certainly enjoy
OR 
2019 #1 • George Dickel 13 year old Bottled in Bond (Distilled in Fall 2005)
First of all for $40 hard to bash it that badly, in fact i really like it VERY MUCH SO 
It has a fairly unique nutty nose & palate that i enjoy
The only thing I can compare that consistent from start to finish nuttiness is and this will certainly make you laugh as its not a bourbon & it costs in some cases $1300 a bottle is Van Winkle Rye - I shit u not.
I have had several pours from different bottles and I AM PLEASED - VERY PLEASED!!!!
Charcoal filtering pleasantly softens this whiskey 
A 13 year old whiskey does not hurt & one does not pay the price others might charge such as Bakers 13 at 2.5 times OR MORE the cost!!!
There is Chocolate, a very pleasant spice, nuts, more nuts maybe peanuts, pralines, fruit like sweetness
Gonna give this one a 4.25 - 4.5/ 5 - as 4.25 seems to low & 4.5 possibly too high

3.0,"A strong musk mixed with semi sweet red fruit on the nose. The palate tastes like the nose. Musk, nuts, red fruit, and oak. Not much sweetness. A medium finish that intensifies the musk and oak profile. Not terrible but not that great either. Not necessarily my cup of tea (whiskey)"

5.0,"The color seemed considerably darker than than a younger bourbon. 

The nose seems extremely well balanced, I am an amateur but I don't notice anything out of the ordinary, oak, vanilla, Carmel.  

The body is smooth, some hints of citrus appear as it rolls over my tongue,  what seemed simple on the nose just took a complex turn, and I like it. The finish is easy and at 100 proof, one of the smoother that I've tried.

I am impressed. This 13 year just became my celebration or very special guest drinker. I think this is right up there with my EH Taylor."

3.75,Crazy unique profile. Classic dickel vitamin with dill and herbal spice. Very faint vanilla sweetness. Different and crave-able
4.5,"Revisiting this one again now that my bottle has opened up and oxidized more. 
Nose  - nuts is the first thing I noticed with some honey and oak. Peanuts prevails here as the primary note to the nose and it’s just very unique smell. Personally love the way this smells

Taste - has that classic dickel taste and so much more. Peanuts, caramel and honey all come to my palate. Starts a little bitter and smooths out in the finish as an oaky peanut oily taste. 

Price and value
I have seen this bottle as cheap as 28$ and as expensive as 100. Seems to be mostly available around 40$ but getting harder to find. For a bottle under 50$ I feel this is an outstanding buy. Highly recommend for something different that won’t break the bank."

4.25,"There’s a lot going on here. Definitely bigger for what I was expecting of a Tennessee whiskey. Very complex from nose to finish. Nutty, candied sugars, fruity, spicy, and clean. Would like more of a mouth feel but that’s a personal preference since this is very rich in flavor. For a 13 year old bottled in bond whiskey for around $40, really hard to argue about this one. Was totally skeptical since it won Whiskey Advocate Whiskey of the Year. Totally impressed with this Dickel!"

3.0,"Too be honest, I couldn't vibe with this whiskey. There are some nice flavors here. The nose has some maple and spice. The taste has dusty corn, pepper, mint, and oakiness from the barrel. But there's an artificial taste to this too. The fruit on the nose and taste feels like artificial flavoring like those fruit-shaped hard candies I use to get at elementary school. It leaves a dry, chalky feeling in my mouth, and an after taste I can't get over. It's unique, but its not for me. I think I'll make this a mixer and revisit it when it has a chance to open up from oxidation."
1.5,"You either like it or you don’t and unfortunately I don’t. As soon as someone said they tasted Flintstone’s vitamins that’s all I could taste and had to trade the bottle. 

I use the rating scale below. Distiller uses a scale of 5 and I use a scale of 10, but I’m sure you’re not too drunk to do the math! 

1. Disgusting - So bad I poured it out.

3. Bad - Multiple flaws.
4. Below average - Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.
5. Good - Just average.

3.75,"Nose - definitely unique and different from any bourbon I’ve tried, toasted nuts (hazelnut maybe) and oak, dry dusty spices, maple, caramel, moderate ethanol burn. 

Taste - sweet baking spices, nutmeg, toasted oak, dusty, chalky, sweet corn, toffee, rye spice comes through, finishing dry and spicy/sweet.

Solid sipper (extremely good for ~$30). I bet this would make a good old fashioned."

4.5,Generally delightful. Usually don't like Dickel
3.5,"Nose: reminded me of nut maple goodies sold warm at Sears candy counters back in the day.  That alone instantly intrigued me.  

Palate: toasted nuts - heat from the start.  Coats the tongue well. 

Finish: long.  Actually probably the best part of this whiskey.  Fruit flavors magically appear (apricot?).  

Note: tried it a few days later with a ice ball.  Really opened it up.  I’m usually a neat man (especially in winter’s months), but I believe this is best enjoyed with at minimum a few drops of water."

3.0,So I could never place where so many of the bourbons and whiskeys I didn’t like were sourced.  I now know it’s Dickel.  I always said the scent was peanuts but upon reading more reviews it’s the flint stones vitamin note.  This whiskey packs an amazing punch of char and oak flavor.  The finish is fairly long and it’s not thin at all.  Unfortunately that dang vitamin note is what I get the most.  I will give credit that it is done well and for those that don’t ever get the Dickel vitamin note you will most likely love it.

4.0,"Now on my 2nd bottle of this and wanted to review it for a 3rd time. Enjoying this one neat.

Nose - instantly get peanuts again with sugar, caramel and heavy honey. Honey roasted peanuts anyone? Not quite.

Taste - Starts light, rolls on the tongue and gets oily and full with a nice tongue coat. Honey up front and another sweet and sugary taste. Not getting near as much peanuts up front as I did the other bottle. The finish is a very very long and spicy end with a touch of bitterness, peanuts, pepper at the end. Medium long finish.

Overall and value - good and unique, getting harder to find for reasonable price. So far not liking this bottle as much as the first."

3.0,I’ve never had George Dickel Bottle in Bond before I bought this bottle. This bottle tastes exactly like Smooth Ambler Old Scout 13 year. They both have this very different after taste. Not sure if I like it or not.
2.5,Taste like pop rocks candy with peanuts. Not a fan.
3.25,"Sweet nose with some oak. Body is peppery, oak, corn, peanut with a spicy finish."
4.25,"Heavy nose of peanut, peanut butter, and pecan pie. Hints of peach and candied pear. Subtler hits of dried cherry, chocolate, and cola. 

Peanut butter and chocolate palate. Long, spicy finish. Cinnamon and clove. Sweet, but not overly so. A bit woodsey. Heavy feeling body. 

Phenomenal at $36 retail MSRP. Less so at $90 shipped, as this was. The Barrel Select is slightly better/smoother, easier to come by, and half the price. But it was a gift, so can't complain."

4.25,"This is the second bottle of this stuff that I’ve tried. I bought my first bottle in Tennessee in summer 2019 shortly after it was first released. I had read about it online and was eager to give it a try. 

Despite my expectations, I was disappointed as I had expected much more from a 13-y-o whiskey. I was even more surprised to see it named Whisky of the Year. This second bottle, however, is quite different from the first. 

The aroma is sweet, spicy and a touch floral. It tastes quite smooth and full-bodied. It honestly reminds me of Four Roses SB, which is quite baffling considering its low rye content; it may have something to do with the unique strain of yeast used by George Dickel. 

There’s quite a bit of corn flavor there as well. Brown sugar, nutmeg, caramel and oak define the tongue-dazzling performance that entertains with each sip. This is a sugary, oaky dram that has been blessed by its time in the wood and was bottled at its peak, no doubt. 

Compared to Dickel Barrel Select, this is a whole different ballgame. Barrel Select is much lighter and has more of a Tennessee whiskey feel while GD bib tastes like good old-fashioned bourbon. 

The first bottle I tried seemed thin and harsh, but this one is quite the opposite. That signature Dickel yeast flavor is definitely present, but it melds perfectly with the corn and rye flavors to produce a solid bourbon. 

I still don’t know if this was worthy of all the awards it received, but it’s certainly a strong contender and a wonderful new release."

3.75,"High Oak, Char"
5.0,"Wow, this is absolutely delicious. Amazing aromas right out of the bottle - the cinnamon hits you first, followed but subtler but still very present notes of orange, citrus, and nutmeg. On the palate, an initial hit of heat quickly gives to a burst of flavors so complex I can’t even name them all - but I definitely detected ash, leather, anise, and a hint of sherry on the finish. I can definitely see why this won Whiskey Advocate’s Whiskey of the Year - I’m not sure I’ve ever had an American whiskey this complex and multi-layered."
