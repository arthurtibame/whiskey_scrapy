4.0,"On the nose is very sweet caramel and oak.  Rich spices, vanilla, orange peel, ginger, sweet corn, butter, cherry, with hints of floral and herbal notes.
-
To the palate it is fruity sweet and spicy with rich oak flavours.  Softer than you would expect for 107° Proof.  Herbal rye notes, black pepper, cinnamon, vanilla, butter, caramel corn, candied orange peel and cherry candy.
-
The finish is dry with oak, rye notes, lingering spices, and leather.
—
With water the nose is darker and sweeter with rich brown sugar caramel and vanilla.  More sweet on the palate, and less spicy, but the ginger remains.  In the finish it is no longer dry, lingering sweet oak and roasted nuts.

I think this is a really nice, flavourful bourbon, but it lacks the punch and intensity I get with Knob Creek.  Nice complexly, and I believe this is nearly Barrel Proof, but it does seem a little expensive for what it is."

Palate - Tastes like it smells. Oak and peanut brittle. Oily. Some menthol and bitter undertones. Very nice burn. Long finish. Lots of residual flavors on this. Not an especially complex bourbon, but a super enjoyable one.

Great dram. This is similar to the Knob Creek SiB, but a little better and more peanut brittle flavor. A little smoother, too. Worth the $7 or so difference. (Although I’ve a store pick SiB that’s way better!)."

4.5,"Tasting neat.  Beautiful deep color. Nose is ethanol, leather, oak, with some butterscotch and baking spices.   Taste starts out sweet and rich.  All the sugar flavors are deep and complex.. a mix of butterscotch, caramel, brown sugar with stone fruit, vanilla, hot cinnamon, and a little baking spice in the background.  Think of a well done peach cobbler.  Savory leather, oak, black pepper, toasted nuts, cocoa powder, and smoke are all players and stand equally with the sweet side.  The finish is medium long and dry.

Overall balanced and complex.  There's a lot of flavors here and none of the notes overpower the others.  Of all the members of the JB Small Batch family, this is the one you want to marry..The one you never get tired of talking to.  Perfect sit down and sip a while bourbon."

3.5,"Butterscotch, leather and Orange are spot on ways to describe the nose of this bourbon - very little bite but produces the same flavor profile on the backend. I would say this lacks mid and finishing flavors but presents itself very strong up front.

Few drops of water is all it need to open up.

Not as hot as Bookers (which I don’t consider to be that hot anyways) and prefer the complexity of Bookers but this is not a bad offshoot to explore."

4.25,"Well I promised something better for the next review and here we are with an all around classic. Classic name, label, heritage and distillery.  The Distiller notes seem pretty accurate.  This is definitely something better.

Off the top the nose opens up with a heavy spiced rum-raisin cake, with a little time the rich caramel-brown sugars also arrive.  Just a hint of the family ""sour"" style fermented mash flora is tucked under neath.  For me the trademark Beam peanut shell note is absent, and not really missed,  still the nose on this will in no way disappoint anyone who is a fan of original heavy, sweet Kentucky bourbon.  If that's not enough for you, it's 107 proof and barely carries a trace of ethanol to tingle the nose hairs.

Up front I get a wallop of sweet, dank sugar and spice, spiciness like an extra bit of the rye was left in for good measure.  Through the middle some dried red fruit notes join in and the noted sour mash dryness quickly shakes off the early sweetness.    The remainder is a trail of some spice and nut shells (I still don't get peanut) woods and nibs.  It is a bit of a menagerie of traditional bourbon whiskey character, well balanced and acted out.

You could almost picture Tennessee Williams sipping on this while scripting a classic play with visions of glass horses dancing in his head while working his old south drama.  Baker's 107 is Americana and Americana is Baker's, it is why we love the tradition imparted by the finest of the genre. 

Occasionally found under the 50$ mark, I would say it's the equal of many bottles at twice the price.   

Liting up a Romeo & Juliet House of Capulet, just because...   Cheers!"

It has very strong caramel, toffee, cinnamon, and oak flavors, but not enough it will shock you. Just one step below that! It’s a long most feel, but not so long you are still tasting it when you want another sip. To me, this is perfect! For you cigar smokers out there, this pairs nicely with a medium to full body cigar. The flavours do not diminish, nor do they override your stick. Pricey - but to me - worth it! Some think it’s an unnecessary middle step between knob and bookers. To me - this one makes THEM irrelevant. Almost."

4.0,"Baker's looks like it belongs in a wine section of the liquor store more than the bourbon shelf. The name is in honor of Jim Beam's grandnephew, Baker Beam, who was the Head Distiller at the Clermont location and inducted into the Kentucky Bourbon Hall of Fame in 2007.
Baker's was first released in 1992 as the third expression in Jim Beam’s ""Small Batch Bourbon Collection.""
The label honors Baker Beam's love of bourbon stored in the top floors of the rickhouse and his belief that it achieved peak flavor profile in high storage at 7 years.
Bottled at 107 proof and still proclaiming 7 year age, it is a fantastic bourbon that many may have overlooked because of $55+ price point. Some balk paying that much for a 7 year old bourbon when you can still pick up 10+ year bourbons for under $40.
If you decide to splurge, you will most certainly not be disappointed. Baker's packs a lot of flavor with burnt sugar, toasted almonds, and kettle corn on the nose and palate, along with the usual vanilla, cinnamon, and charred oak that bourbon is known for. Finish is nice, long, spicy and brown sugar sweet at the same time. Excellent bottle for your shelf and should not be overlooked!"
4.25,null
4.0,"A sample from dthom as part of the ""whiskey transfer program"".  Very excited to try this.

Nose: Very nutty with deep wood notes.  Boiled peanuts, dark caramelized sugars, vanilla, and an odd yeasty note that almost comes across like a cross between white bread and hand lotion.  It's not off putting but a little weird.  Background orange peel.

Flavor: Super nutty but tending more towards toasted pecan, more dark sugars, vanilla, leather, tobacco, and pencil shavings.

Finish:  Medium long with quite a bit of barrel bitter and dark wood notes which fades in to a sweeter note with cedar and lots of clove and nutmeg.

Overall this is super interesting and a little more easy to drink than Booker's.  I like the Booker's stuff but you kind of have to brace yourself for it and this is quite a bit more drinkable.  Highly recommend."
4.75,"Off the bat, the ""Jim Beamness"" hits me.  What I mean by this is that each Jim Beam product has a certain, familiar character because of the similarities in the mash bill and aging.  Baker's, though, is the smoothest and most delicious expression of this character.  I find this to be the most drinkable and memorable Jim Beam product out there.  There are others that are extremely good (Bookers, Knob Creek), but this one takes the cake for me.  Not to mention it is the best bourbon for the fall as there are some hints of decaying leaf on the nose and palate.  I highly recommend to anyone looking for a solid ""higher end"" bourbon."

3.75,"Saw this on sale for $39.99 so picked it up. Have read mostly positive reviews but my feelings are mixed. The nose is nice and sweet with brown sugar and butterscotch with a tinge of rye spice and oak. Its light, fresh and inviting. Mouthfeel is thin for proof and the 107 makes itself known. Palate has caramel and candied fruits with some more rye and oak. Flavor comes on strong but lacks heavy depth . Finish is dry with fading caramel, rye and plenty of barrel. I enjoy the sweet notes and spicy rye but overall it doesn't hang with the heavyweights imo. I find KC single barrel superior as well as Colonel T, Stagg Jr and I wont even get started on OF1920 again. Don't get me wrong I think this is a very good bourbon but at this price point(40-50+ $) you gotta bring it . Still cant mark down too much as I recognize the quality and truly enjoy the flavor........... 89/100..........very enjoyable but not elite imo... Update: how's this for variance- checked my old NH store site and this went up to $57, conversely saw it at the Twins sale for $33......Twins runs sale again in Feb will probably get another bottle of this at that price"

4.5,Blown away by this. Has the sweetness of Booker but much less heat.
2.25,Nothing special to me.  I get a hint of vanilla but mostly just heat and oak spice.  There's some slight apple cinnamon on the finish.

3.75,"This is a mighty tasty Bourbon and at 107 proof it is not a sleeper. It has a sweet, vanilla nose but flavor brings some pepper, cinnamon and heat with it. It’s a really good dram but always felt it was priced high. Until I found it for $43. 
Then they made it a single barrel? Crazy"

4.5,"This Baker’s is the original 7 year; the one that was part of the Small Batch series. Through the years, the Baker’s line has garnered significantly less attention than it’s Jim Beam Small Batch series counterparts. Now, it seems that the advent of Legent was not merely an addition to the line; it is to serve as Baker’s replacement. The switch to a single barrel seems to be a move to generate excitement around the product.

Even so, the bourbon itself has always been of a high quality. It’s always been one of the highlights of the small batch series to me, in fact. This one is from from Batch No. B-90-001. Let’s get into it.

Nose: Classic Beam peanut and rich caramel. Heavy dose of oak and barrel char. There’s also butterscotch, toffee, brown sugar, and cocoa. It’s a relatively sweet affair, but there is also a fresh orange citrus in there as well. And of course, the spices. Cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and allspice. Great start.

Palate: Caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, and leather. Peanut and cola are also present. Still heavily oaked, and very spicy. More cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, now with the addition of black pepper. A bit of barrel char that presents itself as a red meat note. A bit bitter, but not enough to derail the overall experience. A half-step down from the nose but still very good.

Finish: Initially, there’s a note I can only describe as “floury.” After that, it’s a wave of brown: caramel, brown sugar, cocoa, and charred meat. Then the spices take over: cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg, all adding up to what makes a for a long finish. The 107 proof that was relatively unnoticeable until now hits like a freight train. A great way to punctuate a superb glass. It’s elevated back to the quality of the nose here.

Don’t fix it if ain’t broken? That’s my opinion with this one. This was one has performed very-well as a small batch release for years. It’s still 7 years old, sour mash, 107 proof. Now Single Barrel instead of Small Batch. Now in some modern-art inspired bottle instead of the classic Booker’s style bottle I’ve come to know and love.
I’ll try the new SB with an open mind. Given how good this one is, I’m excited for it. In terms of bang for buck, this way up there. $50 for an age-stated, high-octane, elite quality bourbon? I’m in. I’ll give it a 4.5. Don’t screw this one up, Beam. If anything, I’d have said to fix Basill Hayden’s, but I suppose it’s selling quite well, and a lot better than this one. Regardless, this one is a stalwart that somehow got lost in the mix. Apart from the single barrel status, this one remains largely untouched. Hopefully that’s how it stands, because this is phenomenal stuff."

3.75,"Starting off the nose gives off hints of banana bread.  The first sip brings more spice then you would expect from such a high corn mash. It almost drinks like a high rye blend. It definitely brings the heat at 107 Proof and is not a smooth drinker.  Overall the flavors bring more nut bread and bran muffin to the table, but it is a bit of a rough ride due to the heavy burn."

4.25,"Added a few drops of water this time. I'm trying to learn how to taste, and describe what I taste. The corn taste I usually get from bourbon isn't as pronounced this time. Still sharp, which I like. And strong. Banana? Caramel; no, more like butterscotch. Am I picking up a trace of smokiness? Or do I just think I should? Definitely some spices, but I'm not good at picking them out."

3.25,"Baker’s 7yr Bourbon 

Nose: cherry cordial, cedar shavings, sawn oak boards, dusty grain sack, milk chocolate, caramel, nougat, barrel char. 

Palate: a touch warm on entry. The proof is evident but not overly harsh. Barrel forward with a healthy dose of sweet oak notes. Vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, chocolate covered peanuts. The proof really gets peppery on the backend and finish. A nice peppery spice coats the whole mouth from the back of the throat forward. Its oily and mouth coating and yet drying like a very tannic wine. The amber liquid clings to the glass slowly forming thick viscous legs. 

Finish: it just goes and goes. Cracked peppercorns, leather, oak shavings sprinkled in brown sugar. Cigar wrapper. 

Overall, it’s a solid Kentucky bourbon in the Beam style. A good higher proof bourbon but not great and for the price it faces some stiff competition...i’m looking at you Rare Breed and especially Ironroot Harbinger."

one of best house whisky,
 Nose : smell  cremy , dry fruit , 
Mouth taste: smooth , balance , 
Palate : lasting long sweet"
4.25,After this bottle has opened up for a month it has become one of my favorites! Nose has rich Carmel and baking spices. Just smells like really good mature bourbon. Great rich flavors of baking spices and typical bourbon notes on palate. Medium body but the right amount of barrel spice and decently long finish

3.25,"Nutty & vanilla. A bit hot but fits the proof. Oak and char. It realy coats the mouth with a drying burn and heavy finish. Dark caramel and charred wood. There is a thin alcohol flavor that emerges and screams Beam in the middle, but maybe that's mental. Overall, I'd much rather spend around the same amount on Colonel E.H. Taylor SB, which is still by far my favorite bourbon and usually in the$50-$60 range."

4.0,"Found this one at a Walmart on clearance for $32. Better than the regular $55 I've seen when not on sale/clearanced. Bought two bottles just based on the cost alone. I'm not a huge Beam fan but I've only had a few examples and none of the ""higher end"" ones. 

The nose on this is sweet sugary, baked sugar cookies, vanilla, honey? Not what I expected from a Beam. I was expecting more of a Knob Creek smell. My first sip is exactly that, Knob Creek but not as fiery as the 120 proof they offer. I'm really liking this and from the reviews left on Distiller I was afraid this was going to be really hot. Maybe  I got a good one but this isn't hot at all, pretty smooth actually. One small cube and this really opens up the sweetness. I'd like to try this side by side with a Booker's and Knob Creek and see if I get the same tasting notes.  

Overall I like this and for the price I paid i'd buy it again but the Baker's line has changed and the small batch expression is no longer available. It was rebranded as single barrel and the bottle shape changed. For $35 I really like this but for $55 I wouldn't purchase again."

3.0,"It smells pretty standard - wood, spice, vanilla, caramel. Surprisingly, the spice is a lot more present here. The palate has some spicier spices (like chilis and chiplotles) the bring in some more rich, savory, and bitter notes. There's a hint of banana too and there are also some apple flavors. It's a harsh drink, but there is still some creamy caramel with a bit of banana. It's not that enjoyable to drink, but at least it does taste like bourbon. The strong spice brings a lot of black pepper and cinnamon. There is some orange and a hint of mango with the banana. It tastes like the caramel flavor didn't quite work out. The orange mixes with the rye, so either this is good rye flavoring or poor orange flavoring. There's this sweet chocolatey element, but with the banana it doesn't quite fit. The flavors themselves aren't bad, but the banana is out of place and the whole thing doesn't white come together. It reminds me a little of Woodford Reserve Double Oak meets Eagle Rare. It's not a great combo in my book, but one that is likely to go over well with others. The mineral flavor is really too much too. I'm not sure why this is is so we'll liked. It remains spicy too the end of the tasting, though most of the chili details give way to leather. The bit of smoke is nice, but it doesn't balance as well with the chocolate/Tootsie roll as the producer clearly would like and it gives off Clan MacGregor vibes somehow. Ultimately, the flavors aren't bad and some are even kind of good, but there isn't a ton of complexity and the balance is off. I appreciate the deep wood that eventually comes out with the spice, smoke, and chocolate, but it somehow tastes artificial. This would, however, be a great mixer. It does taste like it might be older than it is and it certainly doesn't taste like the proof that it is, so I'd those are virtues, they should be marked in its favor.
The nose has a grainy character with rye tartness but also a sweet nutty richness of toffee. It smells a tad grassy, but not too much. There's also something mildly pleasantly fruity on the nose and there is a big hit of vanilla. The palate is less rich than the nose with a lot of rye presence bringing in floral minerals with fresh apple and some grass. There's plenty of society, though it doesn't have the punch of Booker's (ABV explains some of that though. There's sufficient richness to the caramel for it to come across as toffee, but it doesn't jive too well with the lighter fruity notes and piercing alcohol. It tastes like a solid bourbon (much better than High West American Prarie), but it isn't amazing. I do appreciate the nuttiness without excessive oiliness, but the whole thing comes across as light. There is something a bit herbal in here, but there isn't a ton of it. It find with sipping this, but I really expect more from my bourbon. The finish is balanced enough and a bit nuanced, but it's also pretty grassy. This is much richer and better than Woodford Reserve Distiller's Select, but it isn't a personal favorite. It could use some more balance to really be good, but this is not a bourbon to scoff at. A couple of off notes damage its complexity, but they don't think this drink."

4.5,"This is one of those unsung hero’s out there.

NOSE 
You will smell the Oak as expected with chocolate and peanuts, leather and char.

PALATE
On the palate you taste the Oak again with dark fruit, caramel, peanuts and baking spice. Add a few drops of water and you will taste the honey as it opens up.

FINISH
This has a Medium to Long finish with the Roasted corn and again the oak. The baking spice eventually does fade out but it’s a satisfying finish overall."

3.25,"Decent juice. Nose similar to Knob Creek 9 and Evan Williams Single Barrel. Oatmeal and cereal and minimal spices. Old Ezra 7 and Larceny BP tones.
