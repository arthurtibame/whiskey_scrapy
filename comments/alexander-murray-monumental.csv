4.5,Sweet with a earthy tabacco like finish.  I really dig it!
3.5,"Quintessential sherry cask finished, friendly highland blend. Bold backbone if caramel flavors, almost a bourbon nose, no grass notes."

3.5,"I was looking for a whisky to pair with the Veal and Pork meatballs I am preparing for dinner! This is one that had peaked my interest so I decided to go with it! Before I dive into the tasting, let's explore what's in this bottle:

A blend of 18 yr old grain and malt Whisky (source undisclosed)
Matured in refill ex Sherry and Bourbon Casks
Malt was lightly Peated
Bottled at a mild 40% ABV

Let's dive into the tasting:

It enters softly with honey dipped melons, apples, graham crackers and a slight toffee note. Some oak and a bit of a bitter finish that is somewhat short. A faint whisp of smoke as well. 

All in all for the price paid it's a solid dram. $16.99 Costco while supplies last (SRP is $60)... I will pick up 2-3 back ups personally!

Cheers All!!"
