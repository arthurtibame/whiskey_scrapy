2.75,"Distillery tour today. Andalusia Whiskey Company is located in the beautiful Texas Hill Country about an hour from Austin or San Antonio. They do all their own smoking of their barley, as well as age and bottle on site. Among Texas distilleries, they get a lot of press, and have been featured in Texas Monthly and Whisky Advocate.

This one wasn't bad. Of all the new make I've tried, this one was smooth, easy to drink, and shows hope for the rest of the offerings from this distillery. It had a nose reminiscent of an agave spirit, and a creamy, cereal mouthfeel. No finish, but no aging either. Good stuff."
