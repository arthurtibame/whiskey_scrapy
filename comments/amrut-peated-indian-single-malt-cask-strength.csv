4.0,"Holy smokes! This smells of sweet smoked paprika BBQ rub and charcoal. The taste is the same overwhelming sweet smoke, and then slight stinging from the high alc. - added water to chill it out. Dark notes of cherry and licorice enter the scene, but the smoke is still really intense.  
 Verdict: Good  and fun exotic world whisky, especially for BBQ lovers."

3.0,This whisky is 23ppm and tastes of peat. But once you get paste that there is a lot more to find. There are a couple of claims on the bottle that are not 100% true but still a nice whisky for those wanting peat. Different to Islay peat. Water opens this up nicely. It’s a very young whisky but in the India climate the angels share is quite high. I did a full review here https://youtu.be/IY17KFzktjw if link fails go to whisky bloke and see the video there

3.0,Drank it neat. Worth it to purchase and try something rare out of India. Semi-sweetness of florals and woody hints. Smooth finish.

2.0,Why did someone think this needed to be cask strength?   Super dry and hints of slightly wet hotel carpet on the nose.  This is a hard no.

2.5,Salty and a touch of caramel. Fine?
3.75,"Dark chocolate bitter, smoke (not salty), vanilla. No salt notes. Mostly sweet and harsh smoke."
3.75,"At 62.8% ABV, this one packs an incredible punch.  Without water, a tiny sip provides a rich explosion of woody, dried fruit, and earthy peat flavors but it just way too hot so plenty of water is definitely needed...for me at least.  

With a generous helping of water, the aroma opens up a bit and shows more nuance while still retaining it's density.  More dried fruit, apricot, green apples, orange peel, leather, oak, wood smoke, and a touch of bacon.

The taste follows the nose with more dried fruit, salted burnt caramel, allspice, bitter tannins which continue and dominate the finish which isn't particularly pleasant.  With plenty of water, it is still rough around the edges and while it has some serious flavor, it isn't rounded out like more mature distillates are.  Still, this is a great accomplishment for such a young whisky to extract this much flavor and depth.  The Indian climate definitely plays a huge factor.  For those who deserve big, bold whiskies, this deserves a taste if you come across it."

4.25,"I had the good fortune to attend an Amrut tasting event tonight with one of the brand ambassadors at the Seven Grand whiskey bar in downtown Austin. I got to try five different expressions from Amrut over the course of the evening, plus some delightful punch made with their peated single malt.

This one ranks #3 out of 5 for the evening. The nose hits you with cut grass, vanilla, LOTS of peat, and almost makes you think you're smelling Lagavulan. Doesn't taste the same as Lag though, which doesn't mean it was bad. It had a creamy, vanilla taste once you got past the peat, reminiscent of a cross between a Laphroig and a Highland malt. Very intriguing."

3.0,"If there is one time you need to add water or ice, this is IT!  Without dilution, it's just pure fire.  With water or ice, it's calmer.  Nose is definately peat, lemons and smoke.  But the taste isn't as complex as some of its Scottish Islay counterparts.  I think Bangalore, India just doesn't have the climate to support the complexity that's needed for peat.  I've had Amruts before, and loved them...This one had the peat smoke but not the layers of complexity.   It's a good whiskey, just not worth seeking it out or paying more than a much better Laphroaig 10 or  Ardbeg 10"
4.0,"Medicinal spicy nose. Spicy mouthfeel, cardamom and clove, Basswood honey."
1.25,Kinda boring.  Not for me.
