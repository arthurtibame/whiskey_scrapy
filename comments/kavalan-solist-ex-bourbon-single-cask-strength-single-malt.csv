5.0,"Take a bow Kavalan! Just wonderful! This hits you like a train but once you tame it there is an explosion of varied spices and fruits. Very smooth, literally melts in your mouth. After having this I believe only Kavalan can give Yamazaki a run for the money. Trust me, you need to experience this! Tip: Diluting this with even a drop of water puts a damper on the experience. So give it some time and have it neat."

5.0,"was lucky to pick up a bottle of this for around 120 CAD at the airport in Taiwan. Excellent whisky
nose: vanilla, butterscotch, coconut, rye spice.
plate: vanilla, mango, coconut, raisins, cinnamon, clove.
finish: medium lingering fruit slightly oaky.
I didn't add water despite it being at 56 abv I prefer sipping this and letting it dilute on my palate.

95/100"

4.0,"Unless you have a bottle and can experiment, save yourself to grief and add some water, because the high ABV here takes away from the profile. Regardless, I am of the opinion that this expression is one of the rare cases where the cask strength version is less pleasant than its weaker sibling. Despite this, we still have a great whisky here.

Vanilla, cinnamon, barley, pineapple... It's all there in spades, and for the most part quite balanced. There's a certain je ne sais quoi missing, but it's largely forgivable … that is until you remember how much you paid for the dram."

5.0,"Cask B120106149A.  Distillery character more evident in this expression than the sherry, port, or wine finished ones.  This is what I would image a cask strength Glenmorangie Original would taste like.  Takes well to water."
5.0,"59.4% ABV

Cask #B100924078A | Bottle #201/213 Nose - (w/o water) Sweet floral tropical vanilla, fried plantains, toasted coconut (w/ water) No significant change, maybe a tiny less ""heat""

Taste - (w/o water) Sweet creamy banana/vanilla pudding, nilla wafers, oaky tropical vanilla, light pineapple sweet, white pepper heat (w/ water) reduced white pepper heat

Finish - (w/o water) Hot white pepper tingle, banana pudding sweet, drying vanilla oak, floral tropical sweet (w/ water) Significantly less white pepper heat, otherwise the same.

Score - 90/100

Final Thoughts - I haven't had any of Kavalan's ""standard"" malts but I think this would probably be the closest representation. Minor vanilla and oak influence from the ex-Bourbon casks, but otherwise what I take to be the base spirit really shines through. Nice floral, tropical hinted malt shines through. This one takes to water amazingly well in that all it really does is tame the white pepper heat/tingle from the proof, but all of the flavors remain balanced, it's quite surprising. Amazingly simple, yet complex enough to not be boring, I'm a fan."

4.0,Had this twice and one bottle was decidedly more fruity than the other. Both were delicious. But the Solist from the UK Masters of Malt was a citrus fruit bomb baked by luscious warmth and toffee/caramel sweetness. Loved it even neat.

5.0,"Amazingly simple. Nose- light vanilla and banana pudding. Taste- buttery with more banana pudding and ever the slightest oak. Finish- long, beautiful heat with remnants of oak. Definitely cask strength. 95/100

Thanks to the Cuz-In-Law for the dram. He warned me about liking it..."

null,"Nice bourbon nose, very spicy cask strength- not exactly a complex whiskey - but good stuff for bourbon lovers who also like scotch. To make this a 5 star sipper; a few more years in the barrel and some sherry influence would knock this one out of the park."

5.0,"Beautiful nose with aged oak, vanilla, and stonefruit coming through. The body is full, warm and fruity. Green apples, honey, and lightly citric on the palate. The finish is long, fruity with a gently spiced aftertaste. Overall, this whisky is fragrant, balanced and maybe one of the best whiskys I have had. Cask # B111209009A. Bottle # 131/195."

4.0,"Interesting I've seen people who have tried both the CS and 46% version and prefer the latter. I think I have to agree with Joe C on this one. I found the CS version a bit hot and bitter until I watered the shite out of it...and still the bitterness remained on the aftertaste more so than the 46% version. If the 46% is a 4 to 4.25 this is a 3.75 to 4. I was thinking I'd love to try it too see  how they compare, forgot I had a sample and then when I went to randomly grab a dram it was this one! As for notes, similar to the 46 but the balance isn't quite there."

5.0,"Wonderful. Some one gave me the Solist Olorosso Sherry Cask and I just fell in love with it. So went out and bought the Vinho Barrique and also the Ex-Bourbon casks. They are all great. 
The best way to drink these almost 60% ABV solist casks is to have them neat. Let them slowly explode and dilute in your mouth.  Chew on it and experience their superb richness and tastiness. 
Of the 3, my favourite is Vinho Barrique. However, all 3 are excellent.  Ex-Bourbon is the sweetest with nice Vanilla. Sherry is most oaky and a sherry bomb. Vinho Barrique is a happy marriage of both. 
Be warned... after trying these, all other whisky taste too bland."

4.25,"Cask no.: B141217091A

Aroma: Nutty, vanilla and a bit smoky

Palate: Charred wood, tea but surprising with some tropical fruit like pineapple notes. Quite a strong burn

Finish: Sweet honey and fruit, long and pleasant"
4.75,"I'm a fan of Kavalan.  That said there was some confusion.  We went to Whiskyfest and asked the ladies at the Kavalan booth to pour us the Vinho Barrique and Sherry and loved what they poured   Admittedly there was some language barrier.  After some samples and confusion I am 99% sure they actually poured us the Sherry and Ex Bourbon.  The Ex Bourbon was the one that kind of blew my mind that night.

This is a roughly 5 year old pick from Total Wine.  It's been said that a year in Taiwan is equivalent to 5 in Scotland and I'm in agreement to be sure.

Nose: Vanilla buttercream frosting, mango, papaya, and oak with a malty dusty background note that I tend to associate more with corn whiskey.

Flavor: Sweet but not cloyingly so.  More of a honey sweetness.   More tropical fruit especially mango with some heat from the proof but no ethanol note with some spice as well.  

Finish:  Long finish with some clove and cardamom from the barrel and quite a bit of toasted coconut as well.  Lingers for a long time and dries out a little with the tropical honey and barrel char staying with you a long time.

Wow this is a superb whisky.  I've now tried the sherry, two picks of the ex bourbon, vinho barrique, and port and can say this slightly younger pick from Total Wine is my favorite.  The older pick was nice but the wood was too forward and masked the fruit notes.  Pricey but definitely worth the cost."
4.0,Wow.  Glad I brought a bottle back to the States.

4.25,"With water.

NOSE: Strong deep pineapple and melon. Undertones of butter and biscuits.

OVERALL: Very similar to Hibiki."
