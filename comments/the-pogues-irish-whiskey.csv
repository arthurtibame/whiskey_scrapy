3.0,"The label is hardcore, the nose is grunge, the band is punk, the whiskey is John Denver.  It is nice, very smooth, but it's label is a bit deceptive as there is a distinct sweetness, mostly pears and honey that come through most prominently.  Not overly complicated or long-lived, not much bite to speak of, overall glad I tried it.  I mean in the end, when your alone in your car and You hear, ""Country roads, take me home..."" Who doesn't give a quick check around and then turn up the radio?"
3.0,"Smooth, creamy, sweet: more Terry Wogan than The Pogues."
3.0,"Eerste smaak is goed, lekker zacht, echter snel weg."

3.0,"Medium intensity nose of apples, fresh (green) banana, vanilla. Thin palate, a bit sweet with a bit of a punch. Taste of vanilla, karamel and nuts. Soft finish of short+ length. Excellent price/quality. Would give 3,5 stars if I could."
3.0,Nice easy drinking. No real specific taste. Nicely rounded.

3.0,"Ahh, The Pogues. Being a solid 50% Irish, Scottish, and Scots Irish, these guys are my kind of punk. I remember rocking out to ""The Sick Bed of Cuchullain"" while spray-dyeing my hair green for St Paddy's in college, and it's not March 17th without a rousing, boozy rendition of ""Streams of Whiskey."" It would, however, still be my favorite day of the year without this whiskey, which is just kind of forgettable. The nose is muted with melon, pear, and vanilla; the palate is a bit more interesting, with the same fruit and vanilla mixed in with some oaky spice, but it's a light affair at a volume level better suited for The Cranberries than The Pogues. I wouldn't say no to a dram, but I wouldn't drop money on a bottle, either."

2.75,"Nose: Slightly sweet hints of cream and honey. A touch of caramel. Barley smell comes through nicely as well. 

Palate: Caramel and vanilla. Fruitiness with some subtle spices and honey. Still sweet but very thin, somewhat watery.

Finish: Brief. Somewhat sour and dry. Dried fruit lingers the longest, mostly apricot and apple. Not particularly pleasant.

Overall Thoughts: A little underwhelming. The liquor store I bought it from did a good job of selling it as they made it seem like I’d be blown away but I’m starting to think they just wanted to sell a slick black bottle and didn’t actually taste it. The nose is the strongest part of this whiskey and I honestly would consider this a shooting whiskey and nothing more."

3.0,Довольно приятный. Аромат мягкий ощущаются лёгкие нотки спирта. Вкус не резкий. Какой виски хорошо подойдёт для старта
2.5,I bought this because I'm a huge fan of the band. It's probably the worst tasting whisky I have in my collection.

4.0,"if you think Whoppers, you'll be able to taste it in the whiskey. Malt, hint of chocolate on the finish with a hint of the toasted nut. I personally like it"
