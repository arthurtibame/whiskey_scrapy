4.0,Smooth
3.0,Strong first sip and refreshingly smoother as you continue. Drank neat with 2 drops of water to open it up a bit. Doesn’t disappoint at the price point.
3.25,Delightful Carmel notes and surprisingly little burn for 45%
3.5,For the price you can’t beat it.

3.0,"Too sweet for my tastes, with a bit too much ethanol taste. But with more spice than the flavor profile lead me to believe.
Not as good as Weller or MMCS, but a  decent wheated bourbon. 
Better than Larceny 
It's a good bourbon for later in the evening, bit of ice."

2.5,"It’s a whisky, it’s fine, nothing to write home about. Opens up decent"
3.75,"Smooth, yet a staple. Classic tasting bourbon."
3.0,"Nothing too exciting, but is a good classic tasting bourbon in my opinion. I wish it would be a little fuller. All in all it has a good neutral flavor and I imagine it will go well in cocktails."

4.5,Sweet smell with a hit of alcohol on the aroma...first taste I couldn’t believe how smooth it was with a spicy quick bite.  I do get the taste of caramel.  I’m still very new to this whiskey thing and still learning but I do think for a beginner this is very easy to drink.
4.5,"Delicious and warm. Vanilla, caramel, spice. Not smoky or peppery. Go to whiskey. Amazing neat, rocks, or old fashioned."
