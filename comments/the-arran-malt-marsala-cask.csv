2.0,"The nose is very shy but when you give it some time there is dry spices (nutmeg, anise and a mixture of others), ripe but sour orange, green mango. Also pine-cone. 

The palate arrives soft and with some sweetness but hits you shortly after with a fruity sourness and not unpleasant alcoholic chili burn. Now you get some mature wood. 

Sadly adding water doesn’t do much to the nose but brings out some more spices and fruity acidicy on the palate. Doesn’t really improve it though. So only add a few drops and be careful not to water it down. 

All in all it is simply an OK whisky. It definitely has character but it is missing vibrance and and smoothness. It is quiet sharp and harsh. Also I don’t know what kind of wine Marsala is supposed to be but I don’t taste anything special that could be defined as this unique cask type. It can’t be first or even second fill. But that’s probably because I don’t know what to look for in the first place."
