4.5,Super smooth. Pear and a little peat.
4.0,Smooth and refreshing.
4.0,"Smooth and light with notes of cherry, pecan and maple syrup"
4.25,"Hints of orange peel, grassy, mellow wheat and cinnamon spice on the nose.

Soft honey, lots of caramel notes, some rye like spice at the end. Very enjoyable."

3.75,"Grassy on the nose with a hint of cinnamon pastry (churro?)

Soft palate  Wheaty. Flavor is lemongrass with white tea and a sweet, cinnamon toast crunch finish.  Medium to long finish that transitions into a light, green onion spice.

An interesting, atypical pour to enjoy neat but not a prototypical bourbon"
