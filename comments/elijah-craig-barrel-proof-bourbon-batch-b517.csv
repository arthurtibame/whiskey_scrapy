2.5,"Hot, nutty, and disappointing."
4.5,One dimensional bourbon that absolutely crushes that dimension. Very booze and oak forward that lingers into a buttery ending.

4.0,"good, but not a 10. not much different than the small batch, except the high proof burn.  hopefully a bit more flavor will come out in the following weeks now that the bottle is open."
