2.25,"This is the brainchild of two childhood friends from Basking Ridge, NJ. Same county I grew up in. Though, it’s sourced from MGP, and I’m not sure where these guys are operating. It’s a four-grain, bottles at 40% ABV.

Nose: Dusty corn and vanilla leap out of the glass. Plenty of oak, cocoa, brown sugar, butterscotch, and caramel. Some apple, orange, and pecan pie. Clove, nutmeg, and a sliver of ginger. Artificial cherry note. A bit sweet, but overall pretty good.

Palate: Vanilla, caramel, Apple Jack cereal. I also get a bit of rye-esque-dill. Whole grain grain bread.  Very light, and lacking in complexity. Not offensive in any way, but 40% ABV is not the answer here.

Finish: Cocoa, chocolate sweetness quickly changes to clove, nutmeg, cinnamon spicy. Plenty of oak. Somewhere between short and moderate length.

Didn’t enjoy this as much as I’d hoped. It’s MGP-sourced by local entrepreneurs. Four-grain is interesting. But 40% ABV is a major weak point. A solid nose, disappointing palate, average finish. Doesn’t offer anything I haven’t had before.

Definitely potential here. If it could drink like it noses, I’d be a fan. I’ll give them a shot in the future. I know there’s a second batch, as well as a cask strength line. Not sure how they vary from this, but I’d be open to seeing how this whiskey progresses. Until the next one."
3.0,"No price bcz it came with my subscription to flaviar.

Look - A soft yellow 💛 

Nose - I get a sweet jump followed up by some vanilla extract and a lil floral note at the end.

Taste - Corn, Sweet, I wanna say the smoke and nuttiness go together where its like roasted peanuts.

Finish- I don't get much of a lasting Finish just the sweetness and like a leathery note that goes quick."
