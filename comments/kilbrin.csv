2.5,"Nose- Sweet with honey, raisins, and pit fruits 
Body- Very sweet and fruity at first that later gives way to oak notes 
Finish- Light. The hint of smoke becomes more prominent late in the finish. 

Not bad overall but very one dimensional."

2.0,Very very light whiskey.  No complexity of any kind.  Super smooth (probably due to the lack of any real flavor). Perfect for mixed drinks or for taking shots with people that aren’t accustomed to drinking straight liquor.
2.0,"This hangs out somewhere between a mediocre Irish and water.  It's not offensive and doesn't make me wince, but barely tastes like whiskey.  Still: its dirt cheap, not offensive and enough of it will get you drunk which is sometimes what you need."

2.75,A good cheap Irish. Doesn’t have much going on. A little boozy in the back of the mouth but nothing a little water can’t fix.

2.0,"not a very complex nose, a little harsh for me. probably not for drinking neat. I will stick with Tullamore DEW."
3.5,"a bit on the sweet side, but very smooth."
4.5,"Sourced from the Tullamore Distillery, Kilbrin shares a similar flavor profile to Tullamore DEW. You can pick up on the barrel char fairly quickly, and the soft honey vanilla notes carry you through to some tannic bitterness on the finish. This is by no means the best Irish whiskey I have ever purchased, however it is a steal for under $20. Works well as an everyday drinker or in cocktails (especially Irish coffee). I prefer it to Total Wine's other house brands (Malloy & Kavanagh), as well as Kirkland's Jameson knock off."

3.25,"Light golden color. Pleasant lightly floral with hints of vanilla aroma. Carmel notes in the flavor. Moth feel is a bit thin and finishes a bit alcoholy, but overall I like it. Add a splash of water and it opens nicely."

3.0,"Simple but tasty in the DEW fashion. Nothing off-putting. Creamy & sweet, evocative of banana pudding. A little youthful burn, not unpleasant."

3.0,"Nose: Sweet fruit and honey. Some grain. Delicate amounts of flowers and spices.

Palate: Faintly sweet. Honey notes blending with some malty flavor. Hints of spices. 

Finish: Brief but enjoyable. Honey making it nice and smooth. Some grassiness on the way down as well. Hearty and full.

Overall Thoughts: This is a good one. I would place it as a beginner whiskey to be honest but I do think it has a charm to it that anyone could casually enjoy. It has the body of an Irish whiskey and it is very easy to enjoy. I wouldn’t say it’s anything to write home about but I will consider buying a slightly bigger bottle to keep around for a movie-watching whiskey."

5.0,Very Irish!
3.25,"Another normal, forgettable irish whiskey. It is not bad. Actually it almost made the 3.5 stars mark. It is just not something you will cherish or remember. 

Bottled at 40%abv. Golden color. 

On the nose it is pretty grainy. Grain whiskey, Vanilla, Fondant, Milk Chocolate.
Very alcoholic; Nutty - malty.

On the palate, it is very straightforward. Apple and Vanilla. Not bad, not interesting. 

Aftertaste feels young. Oily, Sour and Grainy.

Overall this is your typical, standard irish whiskey. Nothing to see here, move along. 69 over 100."

3.0,Tasted comparing to Jameson. Much blander than Jameson. Sweet cookie taste.
