3.75,"Nose - the rye notes from the mash really jump out, grass, spice, lemon peel, with vegetal notes and bit of vanilla 
Taste - spice forward, aromatic herbs, fresh grass, light honey and vanilla
Finish - a long spicy finish, pleasant and not overly hot"

3.5,Interesting initial taste. Bite smooths out nicely. Aftertastes is mellow and not quite sure how to describe it.
3.75,"TURNING POINT STRAIGHT BOURBON WHISKEY Mashbill of 60% Corn, 20% Rye and 20% Barley:
NOSE: After a quick swirl yielding skinny fast moving legs, this dark amber bourbon yields notes of Dry Dusty Corn, Candle Wax, Fresh Cut Grass, and Fresh Cut Lumber. There is a Vegetal Note as well. After some time in the glass Tea begins to dominate along with some Citrus Oil and a floral note.
NEAT: The Vegetal Note from the nose is quite strong at first, but it changes rather quickly to Tea. Also notes of Honey, Dark Chocolate, and Tannic Oak. A warming finish with Tea and Oak lingering on the palate.
SPLASH: A little water really improves what is already a decent whiskey. Both nose and palate take on a Maple Fudge Note. Reduces the Tannins and Turns the Tea to Cola.
VERDICT: I usually pass on craft bourbons, but there were a few things that made me give this one a shot. Southern Artisan Spirits was one of the first distillers to open in NC after they were allowed in 2005 and their Cardinal Gin is one of my first (and most loved) craft spirits. This is a Straight Bourbon (meaning at least 2 years old), distilled and bottled by SAS in Kings Mountain, NC (no sourced whiskey here). This is also reasonably priced in the mid-$30's. There is some real potential here and I look forward to enjoying it as older barrels become available. This was a 3.5 neat and a 4 after a splash. I'll average them for a 3.75."
