2.0,"I like cask strength bourbons (Stagg, Craig, Bookers) and I like cask strength scotch (Uigeadail, A'bunadh) ... but, this doesn't work quite as well for me. Some of the smokeyness & smoothness I love in the 16 is lost in this expression. (I've now had more from this bottle and my impression has improved since my first tasting but I still won't be replacing this bottle when it's gone.)"

5.0,"I'm a sucker for Lagavulin & their annual special releases are no exception.  

This cask strength version is four years younger than the standard 16 year release.

I'm not sure if it's the same mashbill or it's just different because it's younger.  

It's very very smooth for barrel proof.  Not at all over whelming.

I'll take Lagavulin any kind, any time."

5.0,I truly loved this whisky but I couldn't quite distinguish it from its 16 year old cousin. Slightly less okay but ultimately no better or worse than the 16

5.0,"[Whiskey Live New York 2016] - Takes it a step further than the 16 year and the Double Barrel.  Tastes like straight up grass, but heavenly, deliciously fruity, sense tingling grass.  I would absolutely love a bottle of this for my shelf!"

5.0,Pure Black Cavendish and Latakia. If you are a pipe smoker you know what I'm talking about... amazing robust smoker flavor. For special occasions to sip slowly in front a fireplace. Stuff of dreams

4.0,Good but the 16 is so much better - this is closer to Ardbeg peat than you might expect

5.0,"fantastic, more brutal in the smoke and peat than 16 but still amazing. rugid"
5.0,Personal favorite - Neat or with a large rock / whiskey stones as a preference - Smokey taste that finishes great
