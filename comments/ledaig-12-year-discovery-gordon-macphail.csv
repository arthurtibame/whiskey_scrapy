3.75,"During some early Christmas-shopping, I discovered this 12-year-old Ledaig of Gordon & MacPhail's Discovery Range. So far, I liked everything Ledaig I've tasted and I had some fine experiences with some other private bottlings, so I had good faith in this one. At only 50 euro's per bottle, one can't go wrong too badly either...

On the nose, there's pleasant smoke combined with some grassy peat-notes. 
The palate additionally reveals sweet and tasty baked apples, and some mild sweet spices, but also some soft caramel/syrup notes but also a hint of smoked meat (or a nice baked steak?). 
The aftertaste lingers on, with mostly sweet but smoky meat notes.

This entry-level Gordon and MacPhail didn't fail to please me one bit. Compared to the regular Ledaig 10, this 12-year-old sibling is perfectly on par: Slightly more mature + slightly more expensive. In this price range, this is a top-notch dram, in my opinion."
