3.75,Pretty drinkable but lacks a distinct flavor.  Tastes like an underaged bourbon
3.75,This is a very difficult Bourbon to find east of the Mississippi River so on the same business trip that I was able to find W.L. Weller I found a bottle of this as well. It is finished in Pinot Noir wine barrels so I had certain expectations about how it would taste. As with so many things in life expectations and reality are not always talking to each other and I will admit my own error in tasting this after other Bourbons. My dad and I tasted this after trying W. L. Weller 12 yo and Angels Envy. Both of those Bourbons are very smooth and mellow with the flavor moving gracefully across your taste buds with no hurry or rush. Red River is not like that at all. The flavor explodes onto your taste buds like a firecracker I got notes of wood and wine scents some spice and a bit of sweetness. I waited for several weeks before tasting again and the flavors were still there but much more pleasant. This is a robust Bourbon and should be treated as such. I like it on the rocks or with a touch of water and I have not made any mixed drinks with it yet. This is an unusual Bourbon and I will revisit it in a month or so to see if my taste and oxygen have changed the flavor any. I do like it but I do not think it is for everyone.

4.5,Daddy like
3.75,"Not bad at all... leaving Dallas on a day trip and figured I had to try the one Texas whiskey on the list... pleasantly surprised... no over the top alcohol, sweet vanilla and plenty of oak to back it up. Cheers..."
3.75,"I know very little about this dram, other than that it exceeded expectations. A Texas bourbon finished in Pinot Noir casks, and I assume fairly young yet, it is nonetheless a nicely integrated, if straightforward, pour. Creamy vanilla, peaches, biscuity crust (like a cobbler), and a pleasant hint of red berries from the wine casks finish. Medium body, medium length finish with a drying sense of oak tannins. Waiting for a flight could be a whole lot worse."
4.0,Great smooth bourbon with smooth finish.
