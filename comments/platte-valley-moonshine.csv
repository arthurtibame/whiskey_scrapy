4.5,I like this one
3.25,"The sample provided to me was Platte Valley Whisky. The first sip had a strong ethanol taste, but if you let it sit for 10 minutes, it becomes a nice and enjoyable drink. It’s good and clean, but it lacks the flavors I crave for in a whisky."
3.0,Simple and straightforward.

3.5,My bottle doesn’t say moonshine. Just whiskey. Very clean and simple. Dusty corn flavors with a little sweetness.  Drink it for what it is. 100%corn. If you drink it expecting typical whiskey or bourbon flavors you’ll just be disappointed.
2.0,All corn! A decent way to get started in the whiskey world.

Simple corn whiskey on the nose.
