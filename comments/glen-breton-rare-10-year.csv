3.5,"Very sweet nose - strong burnt or caramelized sugar. Taste is unsurprisingly sweet, but also somewhat buttery. Would be a good dessert whisky."

4.0,Note of baked apple and orange blossom. Light flavour of apricots and floral perfume notes. Much more stone fruit  flavour with a little water.

2.0,"Ten years in charred oak has lent some toasty almond and vanilla notes but by and large hasn't disguised much of the whiskey's inherently grainy, grassy qualities. This is a very sociable, pleasant dram, albeit one lacking complexity."

4.0,"Vanilla, honey with hints of citrus and aged oak spices on the nose. Warm and medium-bodied mouthful, with applesauce, cloves and almonds on the palate. Fairly long and fruity finish. Quite the enjoyable dram."

2.5,Something about it I can’t place that makes the nose borderline unpleasant. Not as noticeable on the palate and it’s gone by the finish which is better.

4.0,"Great stuff, and if this is what single malt has the potential to taste like in Canada: sign me up for some more! The malted barley and floral notes that hit your nose feels like you're having something from Scotland, though even in a blind taste I knew it wasn't - I just couldn't figure out where the hell it was from!  There's also a hint of citrus that in the mouth becomes nutty and oaky; it really all just comes together in a great way that feels balanced. The finish is smooth albeit short, but you really don't come out complaining here. And while throughout it feels light and lively so that you know it's young, it never feels immature or underaged. To Canada!"

3.0,"Crisp apple, and honey sweetness followed by palatable floral spice, finishing dry. It’s one of the only Canadian single malts I’ve heard of. I think it’s fair to say it competes with equally priced single malt scotch. $74 in Ontario."
3.0,It is what it is..very nice sipping after dinner. Sweet but better on the palate than the nose.

3.0,"Glen Breten 10 Year is a nice alternative from your standard Canadian drams.

This one drinks more like a scotch, hitting many of the same profiles you’d expect. It’s very light, with thin layers of honey, vanilla, oak, and an extremely subtle through line of fruit.

On the tongue, it’s initially quite woody, offering sweets toward the front end and a dry, fast finish toward the back.

This all culminates into a nice heat in your chest moments after this one is gone, lasting briefly before you return to the rim.

The worst part about Glen Breten 10 Year is one’s inability to acquire it. For something falling so neatly within the affordable and delicious category, it would be amazing if it were available outside of Canada.

3.0,Sweet nose. Almost a banana and slight clove aroma. Light on the pallet and fairly dry.
