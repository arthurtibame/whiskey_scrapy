Very interesting bottle design, nice look. Summary: a very good thing for this price - light, drinkable. But without zest. Good option for the beginners."

A couple drops is the sweet spot. This is a good whiskey for the price. Can really taste that Glenlivet coming through."

On the nose you get old plum, vanilla, something that resembles peat maybe and not much more.

On the palate is very inferior, the first seconds is nothing. Is like drinking water. After a couple of seconds you get this strong oak wood sensation, very spicy, strong for the palate but not pleasant. Finish is slightly better and refreshing. 

Over all of it there is some herbal notes but nothing marvelous"

Monkey Shoulder fills the niche of a wonderfully light grain spirit with just enough aging to take the edge off its youthfulness. But it doesn't lose the young, fruity, lightly musty/grainy aroma and taste. It may not be especially complex or smokey like other scotches, but it is a highly enjoyable whisky what plays well on it's own or in a mixed drink."

You are greeted by the sweet smell of vanilla and orange marmalade that follows the palate into a tasty concoction of buttered toast and biscuits. This is a very approachable whisky and it is an excellent gateway into the world of Scotch whisky at an affordable price.

Monkey Shoulder is marketed as a single malt mixer and this probably would make a good cocktail. However, I would not use a $30 Scotch in a cocktail. I believe you could get an adequate result with a cheaper American whiskey. This tastes too good to crowd or dilute it."

Nose: very sweet and pleasant. Malt, orange zest, cream, cinnamon sugar. Honey comb, vanilla. Granny Smith apples

Finish: medium short, slight alcohol burn. Keeps you coming back for more.

Overall not overly complex. Nothing offensive. This blended malt is fantastic for the money. A real malty sweet treat for a night cap or after dinner pour. No smoke on this one which is typical for Speyside. Great for anyone starting their scotch journey, or anyone on a budget. I come back to this one a few times a year and its constantly satisfying."

5.0,"I always drink my whiskey neat and chilled. I was turned on to Monkey Shoulder by the YouTube Austin Whiskey Vault. I bought a 43%ABV(86proof) rather than a 40%(80proof) at about $33 after tax in Tennessee. Maybe the batch has changed to 43% from the 40% listed? 
In smelling, I get a mix of vanilla, butterscotch, caramel almost fruity banana in a way straight off of the cuff. Going in after, I get a more spicy tone similar to Four Roses which I love. 
On tasting, I get an almost cayenne peppery spiciness with a sweet hint of citrus and buttery cinnamon toast (also like Four Roses to my taste and mind) followed by a peaty hint with a light burn which I liken to Laphroaig but not as heavy. 
This has become my new favorite to relax with after a long day/week and I have friends interested in trying this as beginners and intermediate whiskey lovers that have never heard of it. Most of whom drink Jack Daniels, Jim Beam and other well known makers.
Special thank you to the Whiskey Vault’s Daniel and Rex for bringing this to my attention. I have learned, with their channel, how to better enjoy my experience, learn the flavor profiles, search for them and have fun with trying different options I would normally pass on as well as help friends to come to love the world of whiskey. 
Anybody new or unsure to whiskey/scotch/bourbon like I was, I strongly recommend looking them up and finding something you can drink with them that interests you and furthering your knowledge and love for the expansive world of different options out there."
4.0,"One of the best bang-for-the-buck scotches available. It’s not overly complex and the finish is on the short side, but anyone looking for a daily sipper at a bargain price should grab a bottle.

4.0,Easy to drink. Great introduction to scotch.
4.0,"This is an affordable blended scotch with many speyside qualities such as citrus. I taste a significant amount of orange from palate to finish. Personally I prefer the peaty quality of an islay scotch, but if you prefer the citrus flavor in a scotch then this is a must try"

2.75,"Honey oat, grain and citrus notes on the smell. It also has the slightest aroma of a sea breeze. Other than that its a straight arrow Speyside. A little darker in color. Makes you wonder if the complexion is the intermingling of the three single malts used in the blend or added coloring? The taste is almost identical to the nose. Honey, wheat, citrus, and oranges. It has a nice richness to its texture. The finish has some legs and stretches out more than I expected. Not complex, very transparent. A well crafted blend."

2.75,Light and sweet but had an alcoholic burn that is unappealing
3.0,"Glencairn, neat, rested 5 minutes
Nose: bananas, some other fruit and honey, but mostly bananas
Palate: Bananas again with some slight ethanol, it feels thick but tastes bright and light, very pleasant
Finish: here is where it all comes together, as the banana taste starts to fade the sweetness rises up making me think of banana pudding.

Overall: the best value scotch I've found and the summer vibes from this are great right now."

3.5,"Color: Burnished Gold/Deep Copper, a couple slow legs - mostly watery

Nose: Butterscotch, vanilla, and citrus, with hints of cloves and spice. A very light, sweet, and fruity nose.

Palate: There’s an initial burst of that same sweet fruit and butterscotch from the nose, with a watery mouthfeel. This is followed by some zing from the citrus and a light nougat note.

Finish: A slightly bitter bite from the cloves and baking spices gives way to a mild nutty note that lingers momentarily.

Overall: Monkey Shoulder, while limited, seems to be a solid budget Scotch. It won’t wow you with what’s in the bottle, but for ~$30 you could do a lot worse. Will be using this in cocktails or for sipping when I don’t feel like wasting any Oban or Glenmorangie.

3.5,"As soon as you take your first sniff you know there is something delicious coming.

Nose is warm and musty, full of orange and malt, making me wish I could spread it on a piece of buttered toast.

First sip brings light notes of pepper and spice, with some of that warmth from the nose. Palate then transitions into malted barley with wisps of vanilla and orange, but less sweet then you expect.

Finish comes back how it started, with pepper and spices and soothing heat.

It’s not crazy complex, but the wholesomeness you get from the malt and spices makes up for it. For the price it belongs in your collection as a go to blended scotch."

2.5,Extremely harsh for me (shocking considering the ABV). A little water makes it a little better but I’m glad I got a sample of this before buying a bottle. It’s not terrible but I don’t drink that often so I’d rather have a couple $60 bottles rather than four $30 ones. This could be for you but when you can get a Laphroaig/Ardbeg 10 for only a little more why would you do this? I’d take Laphroaig Select over this and the “select” in that name is one of the most hilarious things I’ve ever seen. It should be called LAPHROAIG *we did not* SELECT. I’m rambling so I’ll stop. CHEERS!
