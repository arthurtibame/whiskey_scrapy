2.0,"Nose is bananas and honey

Palate is continued honey and not much else it’s quite a one dimensional light whisky.

Finish is short

Personally I prefer my whiskies complex and rich. This is a lift easy drinking dram and some may enjoy but it’s not a cheap drop so I’d expect more"

2.0,"Bit of peat and acetone on the nose, medium body, with an ok finish--kind of harsh, but not too bad. Not much to say about this one. Not terrible, but wouldn't buy. 2019 Advent calendar, Day 13."
2.5,"Sweet honey on the nose. Taste of lemon citrus. Harsh and alcohol dominated. Long, spice finish. Not for me."
