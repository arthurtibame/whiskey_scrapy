4.0,"Another freebie from the good folks at Whiskey Galore.

The Glenburgie distillery is located just outside of Alves in Speyside, and it is uncommon to see bottled as a single malt, with the majority of its production going to the Ballantines blend. This new bottling was selected by the Single Malts of Scotland label, matured for two decades and bottled at cask strength. 

Very nice. Loads better than the 10 yr G&M bottling. This is only the 2nd Glenburgie I have tried."
