4.5,"No 2. Dram in the Old and Rare tasting. My birth year whiskey..nice!

I'll do a lazy bit of plagiarism to introduce  this one. 
The distillery itself despite being established on the crest of a whisky boom in 1898, was open for only a fraction of its existence. The Pattison Crisis and its seismic effects on the industry forced Caperdonich to close its doors in 1902. The distillery stood silent for a remarkably long period, until 1965 in reality when a surge in demand brought to life this silent distillery previously known as Glen Grant Number 2. Refurbished internally, the distillery was revived by Glenlivet Distillers and such an event heralded a new name thanks to its water source.
At last Caperdonich was a working distillery and remained in production until the turn of the millennium, when a change in ownership prompted a culling of distilleries within the Pernod Ricard ranks. This ageing distillery with no real single malt presence or history, was an easy candidate for closure and sadly Caperdonich is no more.

Xmas pudding, raisins, slightly astringent but water helps. 4.25 to 4.5 for this one."
