4.0,"This greets me with hints of wood, and hints of fruit. It goes in a little spicy, a little charred -- not quite peat. Finishes warm and a little spice, something bittersweet at the brief end. It's kinda generic with increasing amounts of water. It was pleasant enough as a highball, but I wouldn't drink it that way."

3.0,Begins with somehat bland fruit but transactions nicely to a subtle smoke finish that wraps around the tongue and palate to leave a nice lingering taste.

5.0,This is an amazing whisky. I am blown away every time I drink it. It is very smooth with a nose that is complex and uniquely japanese.A hint of peat smoke combines with fruit and vanilla to make an extremely enjoyable dram.

Palate: juicy, earthy, green apples, sherry, sour with a whisp of smoke. Finish: spicey fruity and long. This is fantastic definitely a step up from the taketsuru nas but the only downside is this costs wayyy too much"

5.0,"Nose - Toasted spices, baked apples/pears, oaked chardonnay, dark tropical fruity honey, hint of dried longan.

Taste - Dark tropical fruity apple/pear cider, hint of black pepper spice, subtle clean smoke, lightly medicinal dried longan, light bitterness like oversteeped black tea.

Finish - Lingering black pepper spice, black tea bitterness, dried longan, faint clean smoke.

Score - 90/100

Final Thoughts - This is a nice dram, nice complexity on the nose, well balanced, great subtle use of a clean smoke/peat. I'm not normally a huge fan of peat, but if done right, it can add a great layer of complexity and this does it very well. The one thing that is a bit off putting is the slight fruity medicinal notes combined with the smoke that gives me a bit of a band-aid note, but not enough to completely distract me. Overall very tasty, but I'm not sure I like this enough to get a whole bottle for myself."

5.0,"Tasted as part of a 12/17/21 yr flight. Really nice. Smooth, a bit sweet, and somewhat earthy. HUGE step up from the 12 but I really couldn’t tell the difference between the 17 and the 21 so the 17 might be the better “value”. Value is relative here... Last I checked the 17 was over $200. It was great but not worth $200+ in my opinion."

4.0,"Today I decided to try another japanese heavy weight. The Nikka Taketsuro line has rather good ratings all around, and the 17 was my choice of poison, so to speak. 

The nose is actually rather disappointing. Pear and some spice, and done. At least for me. Not a bad nose, but somehow I expected...more. The taste on the other hand...

Well, this is where this whisky shines. It starts with a spicy sweetness, supported by honey drizzled grilled apples that give it a delicious sweet note, combined with the herbal and smoky peat layers. Each sip is a journey from fruity sweetness to spicy earthiness that finishes with a bit of honey charred fruits. 

A very enjoyable whisky, and definatly a main actor on the stage. Don't even try to drink this whils doing something else, it deserves your full attention."

4.0,"Bought this some time ago and finally giving it a try. This is an interesting and  complex whiskey, with balanced smoke, spice and sweet. There is a slight sherry sulpher taste, but I like that.  Although there are layers of flavor this is a highly accessible malt that will appeal to the more educated palate,  but not over power those new to the blended malt arena.

Had an interesting experience with this one at a bar. For me, this was a pretty good dram. I’d buy a full bottle if I saw it for ~$150, but it’s nothing I’d hunt down or pay way over retail for. 

But the couple sitting beside me was curious, and the height of their whisky experience was Glenlivet 18 and Macallan 15. I let them smell, and they were mind blown, and ended buying their own glass. 

The hook of Japanese whisky, and why demand is so high, is there is stunning beauty on the nose, but the palate is soft and approachable. And the finish is gentle but lasting. It’s Geisha-esque. 

This particular dram had an intoxicatingly rich butterscotch vanilla cream essence that you could smell 6 feet away from the glass. Smoke is there to add support, but is almost unnoticeable. The palate is soft and juicy, and the juiciness continues into the finish, which is wonderfully fruity and not at all drying, unlike most Scotches. To the beginner malt drinker still singing praises for the Glenlivets and Macallans, Scotches don’t stand a chance. 

91.5 / 100"
5.0,"Ceramic Bottle....Finally polished this one off tonight after purchasing in Tokyo in 2012. 
Oak and dark fruits on the nose. Its one of the smoothest whiskies I've ever had, almost to a fault, but still decent complexity of oak, minimal smoke, and some extremely subtle sherry undertones. It's probably oxidized on me having been mostly-empty for several years, but still enjoyable to the last drop. Gonna miss drinking this but it's a bottle to display proudly!"

4.5,"I was invited a dram of this beauty and i got to say i loved it, this one is a very elegant and balanced drink, and i dont think it is cheap, but you certainly get what you are paying for.

This is a Vatted (blended) malt, but japanese people call it ""pure malt""

Bottled at 43% with an amber color.

On the nose you will find brown sugar, cremé brulee, oranges, caramel, cola, slight pepper and gas water (this is the first time i ever get this aroma).

On the palate is outstanding, with wood, allspice, pine tree, oranges and almonds. The finish is medium with an ashy note.

Overall this one is a 90 over 100, great dram."

4.0,"Nose - is fresh apples, pears, citrus, vanilla, and just all those golden fruits and light sweetness that comes with them.  A nice alcohol burn and then a light woody note just brings it all together into an incredibly nice whisky.  

Taste - A lot more spice and a touch of that apple sourness.  A lot more vanilla and yes honey.  If the opening was citrus summer, the flavor profile is late October citrus.  It's no longer a hot summer where you want those fruits, but you're ready for a touch of  spice and cider with your apples and pears.  

I've had this one open for nearly a year now, and it's just gotten better.  A really light dram that is as complex as you could hope for but is incredibly light and fruity.  This isn't my normal wheel house as I tend to enjoy more of the darker flavors and deeper notes, but I'm absolutely in love with this.  

As I ponder this more and more, I am getting a touch of smoke I originally thought was spice and oak.  But no, I'm wrong...there is a light hint of ever so slight peat here to add that additional complexity.  What an incredibly well thought out addition.  

200 dollar price points should scare off a lot of buyers but if you're into this profile, even if 200 is out of your comfort zone, save up for a bottle if you can find it.  If you spend 200 on bottles regularly, even if this isn't your wheel house get it.  I know I'm giving a lot of 3+ scores but I'm so far reviewing some of my best whiskies.  I have no intention of making 4's a common score."

sweet charred oak gives way to an burst of fruitiness.  I tasted cherry.  finish is medium length - sweet and oak. slight peatiness. 

as the dram went on, I tasted more of the peat.  it was sweet charred peat.  it was more reminiscent of the yamazaki 18 in it's sweet woodiness than a Laphroaig with it's mineral smokiness.  

overall, an excellent pour.  I enjoyed it a lot."
3.75,Noise is full of salted caramel with a hint of spice. Taste is cooked/charred pears. But it’s less forward than nose would suggest. Finish is a bit thin and ends with vegetal hints and a light celery spice.
