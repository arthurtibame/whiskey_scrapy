2.75,"Ok i'm in the ""right let's flush out the crap in my sample collection"" mood tonight. Old Glenallachie..gives me more respect for what Billy Walker has done with his latest releases which I thought were either on just above average. This is below average so good to see he's making an improvement although he's still got a long road ahead and begs the question what did he see in this distillery? Plain sweet and inoffensive..no other taste descriptors."
