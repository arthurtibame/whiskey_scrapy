3.75,"This is much better than the straight cock bourbon. See that tasting for details, but, ironically, it has an unpleasant finish. This cock is sweeter and has an initial bit of honey which is nice. I’d give it a thin 6 if I could."
4.0,Very balanced rye. I enjoyed very much and definitely recommend trying it.
5.0,"Picked this up because I loved the package and had never seen it before.  Did a little google search and found out it is an preprohibition brand making a come back...even better!  I am a big fan of rye, and this did not disappoint.  Has a spicy nose that changed as it sat it my glass, first funky, then sweet.  Great mouth feel, tastes like an earthy butterscotch."
5.0,One of my favorite new ryes. Very balanced with nice lingering spice notes. Delicious.
