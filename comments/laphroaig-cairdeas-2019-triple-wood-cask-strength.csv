4.25,"It’s been a good long while since I’ve had a Laphroaig and it’s high time I corrected that. Thankfully I have this sample of the latest Cairdeas release, the 2019 Triple Wood Cask Strength, that was sent to me by the one and only @LeeEvolved. Bottled at an intimidating 59.5% ABV and is non chill filtered and natural color of dark amber. 

Strong sherry notes on the nose at first that mask the typical Laphroaig profile, but that medicinal peaty goodness comes through soon after. Smoky sherry with some strong oaky notes and a trace of menthol. Rich but not all that sweet. The sherry begins to dominate again with plums, cherries and dark berries. A mild nuttiness with that classic Laphroaig medicinal notes coming in like iodine and bandaids. Vanilla, toffee, lemon custard and salted caramels. 
Water brings down the peat and lets the sherry shine, though both aspects are subdued. 

The palate is intense, hot and rich. Super peaty, ashy with charred oak. The sherry notes are there but almost completely hidden by the heat and peat. Salty and peppery. Dark cherries and cherry pie. 
Water takes the intensity down considerably but it is still very peaty with plenty of sherry and cherries. 

A medium-full bodied mouthfeel that is hot, oily, mouth coating and then turns dry. 
The finish is medium long to long, thick, sherry richness, peaty, cherries, and dry. 

While I feel that this cask strength version is better than the standard 48% version, I think it’s just a bit too much. Somewhere in the 52-55% range would have really been the sweet spot. Great sherry flavors with a nice peaty backbone. While I can’t say it’s better than the 2013, 2014 or 2018 Cairdeas releases, it’s oh so much better than the 2017 release. Probably on par with the 2016. So I’m going to give this a 4.25 and say that if you can handle cask strength whiskies then definitely try to find one of these. 
Cheers."
3.75,"Absolutely one for those who love smokey, peaty whiskey. It’s a bit too intense with the peat for my personal taste but I totally get why people would love this, as with Laphroaig generally."

https://youtu.be/gKe2818JubI"
3.75,"The first of two Cairdeas samples kindly supplied by @LeeEvolved is this year’s release, the cask-strength Triple Wood. I’m not sure if I’ve ever tasted the regular bottling, so my only touch point going in is that I enjoyed the cask strength Quarter Cask edition a couple of years ago. 

The nose is immediately appealing, nutty and treacly with a touch of peppery spice and cloves. Neat, it taste gorgeous, flavors of orange chocolate sandwiched between bursts of pepper. The finish is faint chocolate, dry and nutty. Despite the high ABV, which is 59.5%, contrary to the Distiller description, this is surprisingly easy to drink at cask strength. So if you’re comfortable consuming your whiskies at this power then you’re in for a treat. Personally, I prefer mine at 46-50% so that I can stretch my alcohol allowance over a couple of drams.  Unfortunately, this doesn’t take water very well: diluting it to 50% amplifies the peat and reduces the texture and complexity. As such, I wouldn’t buy a bottle of this, but if you’re happy sipping it undiluted it easily warrants four stars. Triple thanks, Lee."
5.0,"I didn't add any water, drinking this straight at 59.5%.  Smells like smokey barbecue and sherry.
Typical Laphroaig flavor, the smoke is front and center, if a bit mellowed in this release.  I taste the coast, seaweed, iodine, salt, black pepper, but there is also a lot of wood, which should come as no surprise in a Triple Wood.  The finish is long with ash, wood, but also sherry sweetness.  The sherry stands it's ground - it's just the right amount - you can taste some dates/nuts/raisins, but it's well integrated and not excessive.  This is a well balanced, robust, but sweet Laphroaig."
4.5,"Mmmmm this smells so good. It is beautiful peat smoke and a whiff of sweet flows through the center.  It is super smooth. There is heat in it for sure, but it goes down as well as the best of them.  You get a sort of peat texture.  It is very peat forward, but just like the nose it has a great sweet line in the middle. I would say roasted caramel maybe?  Tasted with @Mollie-Distiller."

4.5,"The newest Cairdeas release is upon us.  Since 2008, Laphroaig distillery has released a special bottle in honor of their distillery’s day for the annual Feis Ile festival on Islay.  In the early days they simply bottled various aged, standard Laphroaig malt.  Then they blended several random age statements together and released those.  In 2013 they released their first specialty finished cask- the Port wood version.  It’s been their biggest, white whale Cairdeas bottle to date, but in 2017 they began another trend of taking something from their core range and releasing it at cask strength as their Cairdeas bottle.  For 2019, they’ve given us the venerable Triple Wood CS.  It’s bottled at a whopping 59.5% ABV.

Now, the standard Triple Wood usually gets a mixed bag of reviews:  some love all the wood influence, some do not.  Some people think the cask notes overpower the standard Laphroaig medicinal qualities and campfire smoke.  I’ll admit, I wasn’t a fan of the first bottle of Triple Wood I ever bought, but they won me over on the second go around.  So, I was anxious to try this beefed up version, although I do miss the days when Laphroaig experimented more for the Feis Ile bottles.

The 2019 Cairdeas is surprisingly more amber in color than the standard Triple Wood fare.  There’s very skinny legs and tiny drops running around this oily beast.  The nose provides the BBQ smoke and band aids you’ve come to expect from th’ frog.  Young oak flexes it’s muscle before releasing more subtle flavors like mint, berries and sherry grapes.  

The palate starts out with some crazy sherry notes- way more than the standard Triple Wood.  Way, way more.  The higher ABV leads to a more abrasive mouthfeel, but the sweet smoke and sea salt play a delicious role here as well.  There’s still a ton of oak to remind you this is the Triple Wood, but the sherry aspect takes center stage and just dances into the recesses of your mouth.  It’s quite the performer.  The finish is also hot, but sweet and mouthwatering.  Heavy wood notes linger on after the sherry fades and an increased warmth will either have you sitting back relishing the power of cask strength whisky or scrambling for some water to tamp down the flames.  It’s all about how much you can take.

Personally, I really love this version.  I was feeling a little uninspired when they announced this because I wasn’t overly impressed with 2017’s Quarter Cask CS.  I felt like the regular QC was beautifully balanced and wasn’t improved upon.  This CS Triple Wood is still complex, hot as the devil, but sweetened just enough with the sherry cask to make it hit all the right notes.  It’s not perfect, the young spirit still holds it back a little, but it’s better than the standard Triple Wood.  The fact it’s cask strength and only $10-15 more than the core bottle makes this a nice value for money purchase, too.  I give this 4.5 stars and urge fans of the regular Triple Wood to seek it out and buy a case.  Normal Laphroaig fans should also snag a bottle or two and just take their time enjoying this beefed up, wood blend beauty.  Cheers, my friends."

4.25,"I really enjoyed this - much better than the Triple Wood, the extra proof adds a lot to the experience. At $65 it’s a nice price performer as well - pick it up if you can find it."
5.0,"I went to a peated whiskey tasting with amazing offerings such as Laphroaig 27, Ardbeg Traigh Bhan 19, and some rare bottling of Caol Ila(Over 40 peated malts total).  In my humble opinion this was the very best whiskey that they had, save for Octomore 10.1.  This is a stellar whiskey.  It literally blew everything else away, including it's venerable older brother.  Only an expertly crafted, unstoppable peat juggernaut could stand up to it.  I left that tasting with a bottle of Octomore, only because I already had 3 bottles of this."
4.75,"This is a mood. It’s a strong drink with a lot of personality and big opinions. Drink it when you have opinions and give zero fucks about what others think. Or in front of a fire, cuz smoke."

4.5,"Nose: a little bit of salinity, a little bit of leather with a hint of tobacco

Taste: leather, oak, peat. It's basically the non vanilla / caramel / toffee notes of bourbon.  Pretty cool to taste that side of alcohol brought out in a very pronounced fashion.  

Finish: smoother than a 119 proof whiskey has any business being. Very nice."

3.5,"So today Erik Wait posted a youtube video (check it out btw) on this whisky and he got into his scoring methods, and it got me think a bit about what I""m looking for and why these young peated whiskies can and do get such high scores and why, I'm honestly rarely blown away. So I thought I'd put out what I'm looking for and where this whisky comes up, something I tend to not spend a lot of time on with my notes here, but maybe worth looking at.

1) Distinct intrinsic quality. What I mean is that all else equal we generally know what is and isn't a quality/expensive note. Young whisky vs old whisky can both be good and bad, but when we say we taste a young whisky, we or at least I mean I'm getting notes of new make which are flaws imo. Conversely, enough oak to the point of bittering could be a nice complement to a finishing or sweet malt, but can very quickly turn to a huge flaw as well. Both ""flaws"" could be discussed as flaws where as intense and extreme smoke is often a sign of youth that is favorable much like rich oak or complex transitions and depth can be good notes on older whisky.

2) The way the whisky smells, and here I think many reviewers don't value this much, it's really about the flavor to them. For me not at all true, it's 60:40 once I start looking at 3.5+ star review scores.

3) I need depth, complexity, transitions, and nuance. It has to do a lot either in a simple note (a sherry bomb might not transition but that flavor can be incredibly complex in that one thing) or in how the whisky flavor changes before we get to the finish.

4) Finish can save a whisky or leave it completely underwhelming. 

5) It has to in at least 2 of these areas really move me to get past a 3.5

So onto this one. 

Nose - sweet, a touch of plum pudding (I guess I kinda get the sherry cask here), oak is present, and the classic laphroiag malt where I get some citrus notes and some good vanilla as well here. 

Taste - I get some medicinal, some earthy notes, a lot of vanilla (I keep thinking this is a better 10 CS, but i guess I like the sherry/quarter cask with bourbon). 

Finish - it's medium, but there's not much here. It's medicinal, oak, and well a standard laphroaig finish. 

So why is this getting so much excitement? Well, it's big, bold, and there's a lot of shall we say unblended or not melded together flavors. This however does lend itself to having a fairly decent amount of complexity. There is a youthful note at the end as well, not so much unrefined but it wasn't ready for the show. But I don't think a lot of islay fans find this off or to be a flaw and if you expect that perhaps it isn't. Similarly, the finish is longer than the average dram thanks to the CS, but nothing is really happening...you just get to savor what is a very nice pleasant note. It's full body and mouth coating as heck which I love and I'm sure others are loving too. 

So for me this is a 3.5 though closer to a 3.25 than a 4.0. 2.0 being average, 3.0 very really very good, and 4 being outstanding...after that you're into the best of the best. Ultimately, the whisky is complex but not greatly so, the finish is long but not special, and the nose while very enjoyable doesn't make me want to keep coming back. For under 100 bucks this is a good value and in and of that perhaps some will score it higher."
3.5,"This will come to you as overpowering if your new to Islay, not for beginning whiskey drinkers obviously. I wish the smell came off more distinctly, but the taste makes up for it. An explosion of flavors once you swallow your first sip, trying to find out the flavors that come at you but its comes at you so fast, its like you're Lucy at the Candy factory trying to keep up. A glass of this demands your complete attention and in the end you're rewarded with a white ash finish."
4.0,"Neat in Glencairn at home.  Nose is strong iodine, seashore, cigar ash, hints of apples and apricot. Taste is similar, with a lingering medicinal note offset by briny seaweed.  And then the heat comes.  This is a ""hey, taste this"" whisky, not a sipper.  4/2/2020"

4.5,"Had side by side with the standard Triple Wood which I enjoyed very much, and this is even better. It's heavier, thicker and syrupy, sweeter and everything is amplified. I get more peat in this than the standard TW as well. Basically, the only thing that the standard TW has more of than Cairdeas is wood. I find the wood notes to be muted here, which is fine. Essentially - this is a less-woody TW with everything else turned up to 11."

4.0,"I have not seen these releases out here in Arizona too often so was pleasantly surprised when my local got this one in! The Triple Wood is my favorite of the core range so was doubly excited to give this one a try! As noted in previous reviews the Distiller ABV is incorrect as this one clocks in at a very big 59.5% ABV!! Let's dive in:

As soon as it hits your lips you have absolutely zero doubt this is Laphroaig! It enters rich with a massive peat note that recedes to reveal some Sherry notes. Smoked brisket, iodine and a dash of pepper arrive on the mid palette. The finish is lengthy and brings vanilla and berries to play with the peat. It's a tad drying. 

What's really impressive to me is how easily this drinks at this high ABV. Adding water is a mistake to me as it brings a lot of oak forward which to me takes away from the Whisky. Giving it air is the way to go!

Now if you are a Laphroaig fan, this is a must buy! If you are not, this is not for you. Not for the faint of heart but rewards those who dare...

Cheers All!"

4.75,"Wow, loving this one! Nose starts with a classic hard hit of laphroaig peat smoke and quickly transitions to slight vanilla/oak notes and a touch of fruit. Palate is fairly thick and oily. Starts again with peat smoke, fading into mellow bourbon/vanilla flavors and finishing with a ling warm slightly fruity slightly medicinal finish. Excellent"

4.0,"Nose: Neat this is big, bold and assertive with sooty smoke against a dominating background of dense sweet oak. Sherry, tarred ropes, pine resin, fried walnuts, citrus peel, leather, cloves and strong tobacco all stand out clearly and there is a slight trace of vanilla and the usual Laphroaig licorice. However most of these aromas are submerged beneath a mountain of oak. With water a strong aroma of sawdust or pencil shavings emerges and the assertiveness of the nose is tamed, however it does lose a little character.

Palate: Tasted neat it's a sledgehammer arrival of great complexity. Sweet cigar-smoke, kalamata olives in brine and olive oil, bitter dark chocolate, blackstrap molasses, licorice and black pepper. There is a complex and immense phenolic aspect to the palate which in combination with all the oak tannin produces a bitter herbal quality. With the addition of water the palate becomes considerably sweeter and more interesting with layered waxy lemon, fruity notes and many new oily nuances unleashed. The texture becomes creamier and more pleasing. While dilution is debatable as regards the nose, in the case of the palate I'd say it is mandatory.

Finish: Very long. Smoke, phenols, vegemite and brine. The aftertaste is slightly salty and a little sour - it actually tastes like freshly cut peat moss and oak tannin. Adding water softens the finish considerably but does not damage it. Some sweetness is set free to balance the herbal bitterness, which is most welcome.

By the way, the information on the Distiller listing for this is incorrect - it is 59.5% abv, not 51.4%.

This is not a subtle whisky. It has all the nuance and expression of a runaway steam locomotive, and it smells like one too - at least one pulling several dozen carloads of fresh resinous timber. I'd also wager that the constituents of this are mostly quite young. It has none of the finesse of really old Laphroaig and it benefits notably from dilution (apart from the nose, which loses definition).

While this is much more intense and spectacular than the regular Triple Wood I wouldn't want to drink it every day, or pay the going rate here of $275 a bottle. It's a side-show intended to stun and amaze, not a quiet evening's conversation. It just barely makes it to the cusp of 4 stars for me.

Note - I'd be absolutely fascinated to taste this again if they put it into a good refill bourbon cask and let it sit for another 10 years. I think it would then be something truly special - maybe 5 stars.

Many thanks to @Soba45 and @PBMichiganWolverine for the opportunity to taste this highly expressive whisky as a 30 ml sample.

Also, as it's my last review of 2019 I'd like to extend my best wishes to everyone in the community for a happy, safe and prosperous 2020. May the force of whisky be with you, always.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

4.0,I like it… I like it a lot. The Aroma is full of sweet and briny and buttery notes accented with smoke; Palate is similar but with a more nunaced and complex sweetness; Finish carries a heavy layer of smoke paired up with the sweet notes.
4.0,A part of xmas is regifting. Usually you don't tell the person who gave you it you're doing so but in this case I asked permission from Santa to share the love as this was not a 'who can I offload this to?' but more 'I'm duty bound to share this large bounty with fellow distiller compatriots in the southern hemisphere.' Santa aka @PBMichiganWolverine gave the nod and all going well with Australian customs part of this 'aromatherapy sample' should be making it to one @cascode hopefully before xmas. It's a very fine dram way better than the ordinary triple cask but not to the level of the 2013 Portwood. Thanks Santa!
