3.0,"Solid whisky, good character, worth a try.  stood out but not enough to make it a 4 star on my first try."
2.75,"A bit of honey with it quite floral nose. A little vanilla. Fairly thick, and almost up muted pickle juice in the background. Sweetness of dried cherries over the top, with oak. Hint of spice to finish."
3.75,Sweet tad smoke
