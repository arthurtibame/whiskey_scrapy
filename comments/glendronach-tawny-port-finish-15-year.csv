As part of our little Scotch Distillery tour adventure, I had the fortune of trying this sample (thank you Lee!).  I'm beginning to become a huge fan of port finishes---this one surely doesn't disappoint.   If you like the aromas of fruit pastry, this is right up your alley.  Tastes just as good..chocolate, coffee, with that port influenced fruity backbone.  Considering the dual cask treatment, the price, and the age...this has to be  a great VFM."

4.75,"Nose: Orange zest, cinnamon cake, bright and tart jammy notes.

Palate: Buttery french toast with syrup and berries, ginger, lemon,
 mild pepper, cranberry tartness.

Looong finish. The bright fruit lingers but not too sweet. 

Fantastic pour. Not overrated."

5.0,"My first thought when I poured it was that it has a rose-wine tint. Though the primary color is orange/copper. Full bodied with a silky mouthfeel.

Nose: plums, raisins, semi-sweet chocolate, and toasted nuts. A hint of honey.

Palate: fruit cake and vanilla cream joined by figs, dates, and raisins. Some plums and strawberry notes also appear with time. Mild citrus acidity brightens up the middle. The large finish is fruity, indulgent, and warming and it leaves behind bright orange & grapefruit citrus notes along with honey, and more of the fruit / vanilla cake notes from the start. The aftermath tingles the senses with delectable fruity sweetness.

What a whisky! The sherry bomb that is the Glendronach 12 is phenomenal, but this is on a different level. This is dessert in a glass."

4.0,"Nose contains ample preserve and fruitcake notes joined by a medley of stone fruits, sweet red wine, and blood orange.  The palate contains more of the same, joined by ginger candy, raisins, slight fruity pepper, trail mix, and a mix of sweet and unsweetened jams.  Strawberries and pastry sweets including cereal come in on the finish.  Sweet--a definite digestif--with much to contemplate for port finish fans.  Still, if you are looking for more than the fruit contribution, there isn't much else from the spirit to compliment."

4.75,"Growing up the only subject I hated worse than English was foreign language. Ten years of studying French in grade schools only to be left feeling betrayed after learning they were holding out on all the good stuff: Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, and the French tickler. Entering the business world after college was equally shocking after realizing one’s income was predicated on shit luck and the ability to string words together. A melding of Shakespeare and Ecclesiastes says it best: “Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall; for time and chance happens to them all.""  So, now, here I sit happily retired after a career of loquacious drudgery still trying to please my customers. Today’s attempt at this is GlenDronach 15 Tawny Port. I've been on the lookout for this bottle ever since reading @LeeEvolved state he would pay a king’s ransom for the hard-to-find offering. Well, I’m here to report that said whisky is in my possession and awaiting shipment, pending his successful negotiation with my trading partner, Nancy Pelosi. I could wax (my car) poetically about this expression and its greatness, but would rather simply point to Lee’s 5-star review for all of the pertinent details. The nose and dry port finish on this one are spectacular and I would rate it at 4.75 stars."

4.0,"Dank, wet miserable Memorial Day finds me relaxing; reading and binge watching “Band of Brothers” and reflecting upon this important day (grateful for those who have served or currently serving and sacrificed for this great country).
 
A strong raspberry jam nose immediately greets you along with an assortment of fruits and spices.  Dates, cranberry, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla pudding and light brown sugar.  It’s like a Thanksgiving Day dessert table.
 
Once you stop enjoying the bountiful nose, the mind is anticipating a thick, rich liquid but it is surprisingly delicate, however, sweet and spicy, keeping in rhythm to the nose, however not as deep and vast.  Black pepper, oak, vanilla, toasted coconut and milk chocolate (think Somoas).
 
This whisky finishes very similar to the palate leaving the lasting flavors of orange peel and milk chocolate.  A pinch of black pepper is the last sensation that is warming.
 
A nice and fruity nose that delivers a gentle, sweet palate.  A soft sipper that would, in my opinion, pair well after enjoying a rich meal.  Sweet, but not overly.  Spicy, but not overly.  [Dry Glass: Vanilla-honey]][88/100][Tasted: 5/29/17]"

4.0,"Stop number 13 on the SDT is Glendronach. This Highland single malt is matured in European oak casks and then finished in tawny port casks. 46% ABV and it is non chill filtered. Natural color of what I would call copper orange. The only other Glendronach I've had was the Cask Strength and that one was a beast. Let's see how a port finish does with this distillery. 

The nose starts off sweet, but I can tell there is power behind it and showing some spice that will surely follow into the palate. Red berries are the predominant notes. Light strawberry and dried cranberries. Dates, raisins and brown sugar. Red grapes and port wine notes. Loads of vanilla and some custard. Wet oak in the background. Blood oranges and cherry cordials. There is a syrupy sweetness once you reach the bottom 15% of the glass. I have to say the nose is great. Similar to all the other port finished drams out there, but different enough to carve out its own name in the bunch. 

The palate is sweeter and not as spicy as expected, but it has plenty of strength. Full flavor. Vanilla, red berries, and cherries. Light oak, cinnamon and even some nutmeg.  There was a quick note of Ludens or Sucrets lozenges, but it faded fast. Not unpleasant, just unexpected. A hint of slightly bitter chocolate to finish it off. 

Medium bodied mouthfeel that is a touch spicy and slightly dry. The finish is long and mostly dry. Semi sweet with light oak, cherries and vanilla. 

I have to say that after the Cask Strength, I was a bit intimidated going into this review. That one really punished my senses. The first time I put my nose to the glass with this one I knew that all was going to be fine with the world again. Full flavored and deep body with plenty of complexity to keep you busy for as long as you feel like sticking your nose into the glass. Another shining example of port finished scotch. Thanks for the  sample Lee. 4.25"

5.0,"I'm finally getting around to reviewing the third of three samples I provided for our first round of the Scottish Distillery trade group:  GlenDronach 15yo Tawny Port Finish.  This highland malt comes in at 46% ABV and is non-chill filtered.  It's a shiny, new penny copper in the Glencairn and produces lots of long, skinny legs in the glass when you twirl it.

The nose on this thing stretches the definition of complexity to another level.  There's honey, freshly cut oak, red berries and my new favorite descriptor- Pop Tarts toaster pastries.  Think back to when you were a kid and you cracked apart a fresh, strawberry Pop Tart right out of the toaster.  That smell awaits you when you sink your nose down into this whisky.  It's incredible.  I want to just keep jamming my nose into the Glencairn and remembering my childhood.  No, mom, I don't want to wear the corduroy jeans again!!!....

Unfortunately, the palate doesn't deliver on the level that the nose does.  There's such a heavy, fresh cut oak note that you really have to push it aside and concentrate to pick up any port barrel flavors.  Sadly, I actually couldn't pick up much from the wine casks.  If you hold this dram on your tongue, don't introduce any air to it, you can begin to pick up toffee and some red berries, but the base GlenDronach spice takes over so quickly it almost overpowers the entire sip.  Almost.

The finish is heavy, pepper spice that I've picked up on every GlenDronach whisky I've ever tried, so that was to be expected.  It's a long, warm finish that will leave the uninitiated gasping a bit for breath.  I like that feeling because it just goes on and on.  It actually makes me want to hit the bottle again and again.  I'm a GlenDronach junkie, through and through.  Despite the lack of actual port wine flavor I want more and more of this.  This bottle is almost gone and I will definitely miss it once it is.  If you see this bottle on a shelf near you let me know so I can swoop in and buy it all.  I'm addicted like that.  4.75 stars.  Cheers, my friends and seriously, let me know if this is available near you.  I'm tweakin', I'm tweakin'!!!"
