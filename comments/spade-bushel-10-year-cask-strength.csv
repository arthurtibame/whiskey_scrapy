4.25,"N: Probably the most off kilter part of the dram. Heavily perfumed with sweet damp hay, vanilla, candy, corn, but also some white wine muskiness. Very mixed bag.

P: Delicious and hides the alcohol well. Pears, honey, carmelized fruit and sweet onion, a little dry mesquite. 

F: long, sweet, slightly peppery."
3.75,I agree with vanilla for sure. I also get some nuts and oils. Pretty good. You can tell it is a cask strength for sure. Nice taste.
