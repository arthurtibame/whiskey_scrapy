4.75,"This is an excellent whiskey. Especially if you’re a proof junkie like myself. Due to the ABV, it has a good bit of heat. But I was expecting it to be much hotter than what it is. The prominent notes for me are caramel, a hint of sour blueberry/blackberry, and a nice complex oak barrel punch on the finish. The finish on this one is longgg to say the least. The Ice Wine finish adds an entire new dimension to this whiskey that is unlike any other I’ve had to date. I highly recommend this bottle if you can get your hands on it. Truly a unique and outstanding whiskey."
