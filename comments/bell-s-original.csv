1.5,"To come straight to the point, Bell's Original is cheap bottom shelf Blended Scotch which should not be tried neat. The nose is barely present. Indistinctly sweet and floral notes are suppressed by biting, alcoholic burn. There are faint hints of smoke and bitter sweetness on the palate, but the industrial grain whisky dominates it all. It's pointless to speak of the finish. The rough and metallic aftertaste confirms that Bell's is solely useful as a mix and stir whisky (although there are much better options), or to refuel your car in case you have run out of petrol.

RATING: 1.5/5.0 stars ≙ 50 pts → UNDRINKABLE NEAT"

This product is the majority cause as to why so many people 'think' they don't like whisky !"

3.0,"I know this can be bought in every liquor store in UK but I find this one an extremely strange finding. It costs approximately 10USD and yet Jim Murray rated it 91 (!). I needed to know why. And this is how I discovered this very interesting blend. It has a slightly smoky, even kind of ""swampy"" aroma. You can also find these flavours when taking first sips. The whisky is well balanced and although this is not my best blend ever this for sure is a very positive surprise. (40PLN)"

3.25,"When I read on this site that Jim Murray rated Bell's Original at 91, I recently went out and bought the 2017 edition of his rating guide (excellent!).  I had tried Bell's on one of our previous golf trips to Scotland and thought it was very good. Seeing this brand everywhere in the UK and never in the states made me suspicious and, lo and behold, after the first sip I proclaimed, ""The bastards are hoarding it all to themselves!""  If memory serves me, I believe it was at Moray Golf Club in Lossiemouth.  We hooked up with some locals who informed us, ""No one leaves till everyone buys a round."" Now, far be it for me to break tradition, but it was getting late and we still had a hike up to Tain. Nevertheless, we persevered and it was well worth the philosophy lessons garnered that day. Aside, one gent explained to me, ""Unlike Americans, we don't run to the therapist when troubled; this is our therapy."" I responded with, ""Yes, but I'm from New England and we're so cheap the entire profession had to pack up and move to France.""  I think he liked my comment because I could see remnants of his last gulp of Tennents dripping from his nose.  :)"

2.5,"Edit: I didn't taste this one, but an old blend from the 70's/80's.

For the 3d round of the whisky diner I chose the bottle on the shelf with the oldest appearance. The botlle with a heavily worn and torn label turned out to be an 70/80's blend by Arthur Bell and sons.
The Bell's Islander is an Island & Islay blend with components from Port Ellen, Lagavulin and Talisker. 

Purely out of politeness I accepted the dram, but right after nosing I knew I should have rejected it. 
I guess that the smoke and peat have been long gone since bottle opening, somewhere in the 70's or 80's.
It was very malty and grainy but lacked any of the Island/Islay stuff I love so much. 
Some lemon had survived the years of oxidation.

The palate was malty and flat but surprisingly some smoke had decided to stay put. 

The medium finish had the same malty flatness, but some sharp edged spicy alcohol did show it's teeth after all these years.

I really liked the idea of drinking from an old bottle, containing Islay/Island stuff, but it wasn't enjoyable at all thanks to the oxidation.
I advised the restaurant to remove this one from their shelf."

3.0,"This is a decent entry level blended whisky.   It's grainy and light just like all the rest except it doesn't have the bad off notes and flavours so many others have.   I went back and forth between J&B Rare and Bells and the difference was substantial by comparison.  This is a much better blend and it's about as cheap as you can get at the LCBO.   Once you get past the rough young alcoholic nip and typical cheap  sourness there is actually something decent lingering in the background.  Light peat, cinnamon, clove and general vanilla sweetness.   It's best with a couple cubes of ice as intended."

2.5,"Whisky number 2 of the current batch of blends I'm rating.

  Nose: Smoke, with a background of vanilla, sherry and dark fruits. If you add a few drops of water the vanilla really blooms and becomes almost floral.

  Palate: Soft and slightly smoky with a very gentle arrival. Some cereal and malty flavours but no alcohol burn. It develops seamlessly with some sweet fruitiness arising.

  Finish: The development falls away softly into a medium/short finish with just a touch of sourness at the end, but it's a satisfying sweet/sour flavour.

There is a characteristic earthy smoke note to Bells that I don’t notice in any other affordable blend.  To me it is the key to its profile, and it is almost certainly coming from the strong backbone of Blair Athol malt in this whisky.  In some ways it reminds me of older expressions of Teacher’s Highland Cream, back when that blend still had some street cred as a big smoky Glasgow bruiser.

The other thing that impressed me was that I could not detect any ethanol note from the grain whisky component, which is unusual for an affordable blended scotch.  This is good value for a bottom-shelf whisky and I think it’s worthy of a higher score than the official rating of 71 here, and the flavour profile of simply ""vanilla"".

  “Average” : 2.5 stars"

2.5,"Retasted 23 April 2019.

Nose: Light and cereal with some notes of good cask, fruit, distant sherry and a touch of smoke. No rubbery or metallic aromas and no intrusive ethanol - it's a spirity nose, but that's the case for most blends, and the spirity quality is balanced by a full sweet aroma with a little vanilla.

Palate: The palate is slightly hot and hard on the arrival, and there is not much development. However once again it's not so much what is present as what bad notes are absent. It's crisply cereal, mildly fruity and faintly smoky.

Finish: Short. There is a hot ginger / cinnamon / pepper nip towards the end of the development and into the aftertaste, but it's not off-putting at all. In fact it helps the blend stand up well to dilution with soft drinks.

Bells is probably the most inexpensive genuine ""distilled, blended and bottled in Scotland"" scotch whisky you can buy and it is superior to several other more highly priced bottom-shelf scotches.

No one is going to mistake this for a malt, but then it has no pretension to that status. It's an enjoyable mixing whisky that performs well in long drinks with dry ginger, coke, soda and/or ice. In many ways this *is* your grandpa's whisky, and it has remained popular for decades for good reasons.

Along with Loch Lomond Reserve this is one of my favourite go-to affordable blends.  It’s worthy of a higher score than the official rating of 71 here, and the flavour profile of simply ""vanilla"".

3.25,"Very nice entry level blended scotch. It was very sweet in a nice way, with vanilla and grain cereal coming true. The finish was non existent but for the price you cant expect much. I tried this for the first time in a bar in South of Spain since it is not available in usa and really liked it as a every day scotch on the rocks."

2.0,"Nose: light, fruity, crisp orchard fruits, light sweetness, honey notes, some sharp grain notes, alcohol tones. For science, do something that’s a little unorthodox with this one. Let it sit and open up a bit. Also, let it warm a little in the glass with your hand as the nose will change. The alcohol vapors will subside and let it be what it actually is. Inhale very, very slowly and very gently. You will get the fruitiness, but with the faintest hint of briny sea air and peat. It is subtle but it is there. Taste: fruity, light, a little alcohol, peppery oak cask notes, malt, spicy almost cinnamon like, the peat flashes for a moment and fades quick enough, finish is medium in length with spicy peppery tones and a light malty sweetness. You actually can drink this neat but is likely better as a mixing scotch. For the price, very surprised it is was it is."

3.0,"Used to find this the most repulsive of bottom shelf, scottish blends in my teens/early20s. I'm sure I wasn't alone!...

However, after years of developing the palate, trying scores of different single malts, Japanese, bourbons, Irish etc in the process, have recently revisited Bells and must say for the basement price point, punches well above its weight flavour-wise. Considerably better than a 70."
