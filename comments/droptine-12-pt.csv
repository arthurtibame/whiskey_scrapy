3.75,"Nice nutty, grape and vanilla notes on the nose and creamy palate, but feels a bit young with some astringency and heat. Medium length warming finish with a little grape nuts cereal."
4.75,"Honey, vanilla, almonds, and wood come together nicely to make for a sweet finish. 92 proof, lingering flavor without the burn."
