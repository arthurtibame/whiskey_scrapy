3.5,"Glen Garioch Founder's Reserve (since 1797) has had a lot of time to refine their process. This bottle was a gifted favourite from a friend of mine who looks to this as their go-to dram. With its pear and honey nose, it's easy to understand why. It's beautifully comforting. 
That said, while neat, the heat-filled first sips will jolt you awake with its caramel spicy tones and an oak-y herbal finish. Enjoyable on a weeknight. 7.5/10"

3.75,"First impression of the nose is the funkiness. If you've ever sprouted grains, it's pretty unmistakable. The malt, in the malted barley-- it's not as prominent in other scotches I've had, which is fairly limited. I don't know if that's an indicator of a young whiskey or what. This is followed by fruitiness-- lemon, some apple or pear. There's some fatty sweetness, like custard or creme brulee. 
  Taste is very much similar. Really emphasizes the creamy dessert feature of the nose. The funk makes it almost like a cheesecake. Medium finish, and mouthfeel. Great for NAS single malt under $50."

4.0,"In my trip to Scotland one of the gems i found was Glen Garioch. Never had one of their whiskies before and now, after 3 expressions, i believe they have become a trending topic in my mind when thinking of a having a dram. 

First of all, a little background here: you don't pronounce Glen ""GARY-OCK"", it is pronounced ""GLEN GEERIE"". Having said that, this distillery has a lot of history: it was founded in 1797, by the Mason Family who lost the distillery and re-bought it several times; one of the Mason brothers discovered that Malaria was spread by mosquitoes, and during world war ii the british soldiers slept in the premises using it as a military base. Also this was the first distillery to use gas to heat up the copper stills. 

Well, lets talk about this expression, the 1797 founders reserve, which i believe is a rather new whisky,  but it has a lot of flavor and it is very enjoyable, specially for a NAS. 

Bottled at 48%abv, tawny color.

On the nose: Red fruits, Strawberry, Tobacco. Very Winey. Grape juice delicious aroma. Caramel.

On the palate: Caramel, Grapes, Raisins, Oak spice. Nice balance between the vanilla flavors and the dehydrated fruits. Chocolate.

Aftertaste is great also.Vanilla and tobacco leaf. Oak spice. Some Herbal notes. Clove. Very enjoyable.

Overall for $45, this is a great whisky. Would recommend it easily.  88 over 100, balance is the keyword here. Sláinte!"

4.0,"An absolute steal of a whisky at the price they're selling it at. A fabulous example of straightforward ex-bourbon cask aging. Big barley sugar flavours, lemon, light smoke, floral, lightly fruity. And the craft presentation, too--high ABV, non-chill-filtered. For the price tag (it's one of the cheapest single malts I can buy; even less than standard 'fiddich and 'livet bottles) I'm not sure you can find better."

4.0,"The malt is strong with this one (weak Star Wars reference) as is honey or butterscotch sweetness on the nose.  The honey nose intensifies the longer it breathes. Faint floral and lemon citrus and leather  are in the background.  Reminds me of an warm April day.  The honey sweetness continues on the palate through its soft and rich body.  Oak tannins take over when the sweetness fades.  Tongue burn comes on very late but and gradually fades.  A pleasant oaky, dry and spicy finish remains on the palate which sets the table for the sweetness of the next sip.  Water reduces the sweetness, increasing the oak dryness and softens the bite; rounds out. I prefer this neat or a tiny amount of water.  Overall, a nice, easy, enjoyable dram and, bottled at a 48%, is a nice and easy sipper.   Not overly complicated.  Perfect when you are in need of a small dose of simplicity. [$53][88/100][Opened 9/6/2014; 12/30/15]"

4.0,"From what I read somewhere, this is about 8 yr old.  If that's the case, it's really not bad considering the youth.  There's strong floral and sweet notes, followed by honey sweetness and crisp lemon on the palette. Finish is smooth and quick.  Personally, I liked it with ice... Does bring out a bit more herbal flavors.   Not bad for the price.  You probably can do better at the same price range if you go into blends though---- most notably the Compass Box Artist blend comes to mind"

4.0,"The nose is very sweet with honey, palate confirms the honey along a little tart lemon and stewed pears, a little bit of brine in the finish, with a very clean, crisp albeit short finish. Very smooth easy to drink and easy to like dram."
3.0,"It's a strong three, and it's possible the fact that I drank this from a disposable plastic cup has damaged my judgment here. Regardless, I like it.  The nose and palate are strongly honeyed, with notes of maltiness - like a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios. There's also a pleasant touch of allspice. On the finish it's sweet and smooth. Picture a Scottish bourbon with a touch of Ireland. Cheers!"

4.0,"This is not an everyday whisky. Even though the nose and palate don't match, I really like it. The nose is sweet,  lemon and honey; while the palate grabs you and hits you in the face with an oak stave. Then once the wound is open it pours pepper in it. If that isn't enough, it spanks you with a leather strap. After you're a puddle on the floor it finishes you off with more oak and leather. Finally, it lights up and there is  a puff of smoke at the end. Addendum: Now that I've lived with this whisky for a bit the oak beatings have stopped and chocolates and fruit have appeared. The oak is still there, but more as a platform for the fruit. This whisky just keeps getting better."

The finish is sweet and warm and tapers off slowly. It wants a half teaspoon of water to really open up, which is no problem at 48%. Non chill-filtered and a grand value at $47!"

On the palate I find honey nut breakfast cereal, banana walnut bread; there's a strong minerality at the base and mid-palate offerings include astringency and an array of spices like pepper, mustard seed, and allspice. Crisp, mineral mouthfeel and a sweet, abiding finish of stewed fruit. A malt with superb Highland character that comes full circle."

3.0,"Glen 'Geery' 1797 Founder's Reserve, from the eastern Scottish Highlands. Is a NAS, non-chill filtered 48% ABV singe malt!

This was my first dram from the eastern Highlands and seeing this is their entry-level dram I thought it be appropriate. I had this decantered before tasting.

The nose was rather sweet, with fresh fruits of green apple, some mellow honey and a touch of raisins.

On the palate it was rather fruity still but with a lot more pepper and spices, rather harsh on the feel. Which I've come to expect from entry-level NAS. 

The fruitiness did not join on the finish, but instead offered a fair amount of smoke, some leather, plenty of spices and malt, rounded off by dark chocolate. Rather harsh still. 

Overall I've quite enjoyed this dram for what it is and I just had to pick the right moment for it. Which goes for most drams really. A casual sipper with some kick to it.
