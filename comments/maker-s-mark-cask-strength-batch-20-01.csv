3.5,"Nose is very classic. Maple syrup and black pepper bring bacon to the nose. Carmel in the forefront too. Hints of cherry, apple, vanilla and chocolate. 

Palate is round and rich but finish is unfortunately short. Chocolate and maple syrup linger a little. Very smooth for 110 proof, but I was hoping for more bite. 

Delicious sweet desert bourbon that I will keep stocked and would recommend. 

I use the rating scale below. Distiller uses a scale of 5 and I use a scale of 10, but I’m sure you’re not too drunk to do the math! 

1. Disgusting - So bad I poured it out.
2. Poor - I wouldn't consume by choice.
3. Bad - Multiple flaws.
4. Below average - Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.
5. Good - Just average.
6. Very Good - Better than average.
7. Great - Well above average.
8. Excellent - In a league of its own.
9. Incredible - An all-time favorite.
10. Perfect"
