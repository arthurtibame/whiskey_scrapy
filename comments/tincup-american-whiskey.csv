3.25,Sweet nose of vanilla.  Tasting is softer than anticipated and smooth finish.  Notes of cinnamon and brown sugar on finish.  Good substitute for Crown

1.5,I didn’t like how flat and bland it was. You can tell it was young.
3.75,"For the price, it’s a very competitive whiskey. I certainly enjoy the easy drinking of it as the proof is lower than what I am typically accustomed to.
Great value, great whiskey"

5.0,"I don’t understand the tasting description of this whiskey on this app or why the score is relatively amateur. I am amazed by this whiskey’s scotch-like depth and bourbon-like comfort (not to mention the fact that it’s under $30). The initial, mild peaty tones are reminiscent of a Highland scotch, followed by a distant sweetness that reminds me of a Tennessee whiskey. If you’re looking for a whiskey that can reconcile these two regions while still maintaining an element of indiscriminant drinkability, buy it. Take it camping in a flask  or drink it in a Glencairn glass while sitting in your easy-chair. Just drink it straight and rest easy because you only paid $28 for it."

4.5,"My unbiased, unprofessional, quick review of an affordable whiskey. Tonight I reached into my shelves and found myself with a glass of Tincup Whiskey. Not the Tincup 10, but the even less expensive Tincup Original ($30, 42% ABV, high rye blend) which is much more common in stores. I love Tincup. I think it goes down well, has some strength to it, gives me the slight burn that I like and a taste that lingers nicely. And when you factor in the low price, even more attractive! And bonus, it comes with a tin shot cup. They have a commercial on TV that shows a group of campers drinking Tincup by the campfire, and I can TOTALLY see that! I could describe it as fun and tastefully rugged in a good way. A few years ago I hiked to Everest Base Camp in Nepal and if I would have known about Tincup then I would have brought a bottle and acted out the commercial in the Himalayas. Tincup is probably not a classically fantastic rye whiskey in most ""expert"" opinions but I give it two thumbs and a tin cup up!"

3.0,"I’ve been wanting to try this one after I learned that the owner of this one also owns Stranahan’s. I used to thing Tin Cup was just trying to copy Stranahan’s tip cup on top of bottle schtick, but they’re related. And I heard from the owner that the Colorado whiskey portion of the blend is in fact Stranahan’s. 
Anyway, the nose is sweet with some rye spice, vanilla, cola. I also get a tequila note as well.
The palate is sweet and fairly light. Some vanilla and some rye. Not a ton on the palate. Then it has a shorter finish.
I think this one is easy to drink. Only a few standout flavors, but they are present."

3.5,"This is one I haven't had in a while, so I picked up a bottle on sale last week. This whiskey debuted just before the Templeton controversy encouraged lots of NDP's to come clean with their sources. They were very vague about the source of their product, but did give you the percent of rye in the mash bill. It was only very recently that I learned they were blending it with Colorado Single Malt (Stranahan's I assume). Not sure if this was the case from the beginning or a recent development. Let's re-review, shall we?
NOSE: At first there is an overwhelming sweet note, but give it a few minutes in the glass and the Rye takes the driver's seat. Savory notes of Rye Bread and Dill. Straw and Old Leather. Very Dry and Dusty Oak. The sweeter vanilla notes are there but in a supporting role.
NEAT: The Dry Dusty Oak and Leather transfer to the palate. Harkens back to chewing on the laces of your Baseball Glove between batters on a hot Saturday morning. There is a light Vanilla mid-palate. Not overly complex, but what it does have works very well. The rye is so prominent here that it almost hints at some of the High West offerings, like Double Rye or Campfire (minus the peat). At a slightly under proofed 84, there is no burn and it finishes with a light Oak, Vanilla and Mint coating the palate. 
SPLASH: A few drops of water really highlight the Dill and Savory Umami Notes on the nose, while bringing some Black Pepper and Black Licorice to the palate.
VERDICT: I like this one and definitely see the value of keeping a bottle in my collection at all times. Complex without being complicated if that makes sense. I'm surprised how much the rye notes dominate. It really does drink like a rye. A good pour when you just want to relax and not think too much about what is in your glass."

3.5,"Appearance: This bourbon and single malt blend has a nice copper color. Semi-viscous legs dribble their way back down the glass (or tin cup’s) interior.

Nose: The nose is overall sweet and nice. Notes consist of butterscotch, caramel, french vanilla, pumpkin spice, Whoppers chocolate malt balls, graham cracker, brown sugar, red cherries, apple, and honey. And I’ve found for me, if it opens up for too long some dead grass / seaweed funk and paint / wood stain notes come out. But most people won’t leave their whiskey sitting for a couple hours.

Taste: The palate is overall pretty mellow with a creamy mouthfeel. Notes of black pepper, some rye spice, honey, red apple, and brown sugar tickle one’s taste buds. 

Finish: The finish has a warm baking spice kind of flair.

Thoughts: This local offering was quite nice for me. Not crazy complex nor boring, but really nice for the great price. I liked the blend of the bourbon and the single malt to create a semi scotchy-bourbon hybrid. I’d recommend this, and now I would love to try the 10 year old! Tin Cup, Keep up the good work! Cheers!"

3.0,"Nice. Had wanted to try this for a while, I’m at the in-laws for  Christmas and wanted to sip on this for the week...and they had a smaller bottle at the local liquor store. So...here we go.

Nose: More going on than I expected. Red apple, banana, brown sugar and an undertone of char. Cinnamon and salted peanuts as well, assuming from the high rye mash bill.

Taste: Unfortunately, it’s thin. Vanilla, banana, musty hay and light oak elements. 

Finish: Sticks with you for a while. Cinnamon and brown sugar linger, as well as some pleasant vanilla oakiness. Cherry shows up randomly as well.

Overall: Nice, friendly bourbon. Wish it were a slightly higher proof, because the taste is the most mediocre part of this experience. Nose and finish are actually quite pleasant. This feels like a good bourbon for early in your whiskey journey, and a nice background whiskey.

Would I buy for $30? No. Would I drink if offered? For sure."

3.0,"Nose: vanilla and butterscotch. Very mellow smell

Taste: this whiskey is very easy to drink. Good flavor, but no real bite. Some apple/cinnamon, vanilla and caramel sweetness 

Finish:  you get hit with some fruit (strawberry maybe?) and a smooth silky finish. 

Pleasantly surprised by this cheap “American whiskey” and how drinkable this rye is. I bet it would make a good old fashioned. Not complex, but I enjoyed it."

2.75,"Sweet on the nose. Scents of red apples, grapes, powdered sugar. On the palate it’s clean and fresh. The charred oak is upfront but it’s rather smooth and not overly bitter. There’s nothing distinct in the flavor profile just a smidgen of vanilla, oak and charcoal, and the texture is a bit thin. The high rye mash bill comes on the back end with spicy tones of cayenne and black pepper. Not great, not bad."

3.25,"I have bought this whiskey several times over the years and it is an above-average whiskey around the 18 to 23 dollar range but at the $30 range, there are better options on the market. When I first bought a bottle it was $19 and at that price point, it is an excellent blended whiskey. It pleasant when sipping neat and a little better with ice, but it makes a very good Whiskey Highball but it gets lost in a Manhattan and an Old Fashioned. When sipped neat it is spicey with a little bit of wood and citrus(?). With ice, there is a bit more opening of flavors with the spiciness smoothing out and sweetened a bit. Again, this is a nice whiskey but it became popular and the price rose past its quality. I do not care about the story behind a liquid overall I do think the bottle is eye-catching and the tin cup on the top is neat, but it the liquid inside is not worth drinking then you will only buy one bottle. I do keep my eyes open to find this on sale but with whiskeys like George Dickel No. 12, Powers Gold Label, Sazerac Rye, and Wild Turkey 101 out there in the same price range it is hard to replace any of those with this. It is good but overpriced."

they market themselves as a campfire whiskey and I can think of no better place to enjoy it. Will definitely be in my ruck on my next trip. 
The price/quality ratio is incredible and though it’s certainly not the best whiskey you’ll ever drink, it’s still a very solid choice."
