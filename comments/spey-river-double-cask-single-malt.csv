2.0,"Whisky Club 1 - the inaugural bottle. I picked this up for $50 AUD at Dan Murphys with the promise of it being a single malt from the Spey region. It was light, clear and fairly inoffensive. Which to me is a problem as I prefer my scotch to have a bit of personality and character. Extremely subtle, nose was soft hinting at honey and light notfes of wood. Soft taste and negligible finish. Glad I tried it, probably wouldn't buy it again."

2.0,Initial strong flavor front tongue which rises to roof of mouth.   Left feeling when it should build that I am left flat.

3.0,First time trying this one (Jan 2018).  mild and sweet to the nose.  Earthy and fuller than Chivas on the tongue.  Smooth entry and nice subtle after taste.
