3.0,Whisky on the Hudson 9/18/2014 :  Opens on the nose as light and floral with cereal notes.  Creamy texture that's slightly sweet and fruity.  I need to try with water or over ice.  A descent dram and better than most Irish whiskey.

2.0,"46% ABV, Store Selection. 

On the nose, there is a honey sweetness, with a touch of fruit. The taste has a slight spice that quickly fades to a big dose of maltiness. It has that ""green"" unmalted type finish. The color is a very light yellow. This is an average pour."

3.0,"Visual:  Medium amber/gold color. Thin to medium legs that take a little while to slide into the glass.

Nose:  Out of the bottle and into the glass, the first impression was objectionable to me:  sour, almost like the smell of a used vacuum cleaner bag – seriously. Fortunately, this dissipated rather quickly and was replaced by much more pleasant notes.  Wildflowers, vanilla, and amaretto.  Not much alcohol burn at all, probably due to the low (40%) ABV.

Palate: It begins sweet on the tip of the tongue, but the sweetness is soon overcome by a wash of savory/vegetal notes like legumes (edamame?). After a bit of a swirl on the tongue, some vanilla comes through, and I also get the nougat that others have mentioned. An interesting juxtaposition of sweet and savory notes in this one.

Finish:  The finish is short and a tad bitter.

Empty glass: Lightly nutty.

While this whiskey has a nice nose (after opening a bit) and an interesting sweet/savory thing going on, I thought lacked something in the complexity department, and was also a bit anemic. I think it would benefit from being bottled at a slightly higher ABV. Perhaps 46% would be ideal, but even 43% would likely have been an improvement. This gets three stars."

3.75,"To start, let me say that I have yet to find any Irish Whisky (and I love the stuff, especially Midleton Very Rare) that is equal to the experience of much of the Scotch world, most especially anything Islay. I'm sure to be not alone in this opinion. But still this is a fine Irish Whisky. Very drinkable anytime. A very sweet vanilla hit on the swallow, which does not linger and stems, no doubt, from the ex-bourbon oak casking. Unlike the Vanilla one gets from most American Bourbon, this is sweet and gone in a few seconds. It noses extraordinarily well but promises more than it delivers. But that really is no sin IMO and while lacking any deep complexity, I  hold the liquid blameless. For it has many redeeming qualities which, for me at least, must be added into the equation of any whisky's worth. This particular 12 year old Irish shows it's quality in several ways, starting with the exquisite Nose and after the swallow, checking the glass shows an amazing body of thick, syrupy leg structures returning to the bottom. The aftertaste is devoid of any overt woodiness and I tend to appreciate these things. Yet another in a long line, shall we say, of very decent, drinkable whiskys which excel at nothing but are nonetheless very easy to drink and appreciate. Some whiskys almost require me to find fault with them ... and not only due to price/value considerations. Thankfully this one does not. Let me have more time with this bottle and the rating may well rise.

It has a medium mouth feel and full flavor of sweet honey, vanilla, some apple in the background, barrel spice. A slight bitter note on the finish but not that off putting. Not bad at all."
4.25,"This is some easy drinking whiskey. Honey is dominant in both the nose and taste. The nose make me think of leaves a nice fall day or being in a orchard. Aside from honey, I get biscuits and almonds in the taste. Overall, I think this is a lovely whiskey. Not really complex, but it hits its notes beautifully."

In all, the 12 year bourbon barrel ageing provides as much complexity as you’ll find in Irish Whiskey and at a relatively bargain pricepoint. I love this neat or with a cube at night as a final dram. at the $36 USD paid it’s a steal!  My new go-to Irish."

Overall, this was really nice and was like 95% of Green Spot for 75% of the price.  Personal preference would have been for more sweetness in the late taste and finish versus the vegetal.

Nose: apple, honey, sweet pastries, even a teency bit of the cantaloupe I read in some other reviews. Stings the nostrils in a glencairn glass. 

Taste: honey and sweet grains, apple but less prominent than it is on the nose. Burn only comes at the very end.

Finish. Lightly smoky and the burn from the alcohol lingers. Medium oil character that coats the mouth and tongue (thanks pot still!). 

Overall: I’m honest surprised this isn’t more expensive. Great value for the price and an entire experience in the glass. Each sip takes you for a ride and doesn’t let go. Left me wanting more!"

3.75,"Tart berries and apricots, apples and golden raisins and currants.  The nose on this is incredible.  So much fruit. Reminded me of some of the Croatian liquors.
Warm, light body. Fruity, but there is a hint of barrel char near the back."

3.75,It’s the best Irish Whiskey at its price point I’ve had.  Lots of character with a smooth finish.
4.5,"Knappogue Castle is a brand of Single Malt Irish Whiskey produced by Castle Brands, and is sourced from other distilleries, including Cooley.  This is a 12 YR Single Barrel picked by Liquor Barn, and bottled at a nice 46%.  It is quite lovely, well balanced, and at a solid price!!  My score was 88"
4.5,Super mild. Not a lot of alcohol. Sweet and candy-like.
3.75,A bit of light nuttiness in the aroma on this Irish Whiskey. Tastes of subtle butter and almonds. Very light and short burn followed by an almost mint like refreshing finish.
3.75,Easy drinking neat.

4.0,"I have to say, Irish whiskey is not one of my favorites styles and i have been slowly trying new bottles to see if anything is worth me buying a bottle of. The 12 year Knappogue hits the mark for me in the sense that it tastes closer to a Scotch rather than an Irish."
3.5,Lots of fruit and spice. Peaches or apricots is definitely a distinct flavor for me here
4.25,"Honey, very sweet"

4.5,"Nose: Beautiful!  Fresh grass and green apples, light honey, candied lemon peel.  Orange breakfast muffins under the lighter notes.

Palate:  Silky, slightly oily at first.  Mint and malted barley, then graham cracker and slight spice.  Open oak woodiness with almond.  Light clover honey, though none of that citrus I find in the nose.

Finish:  Medium length and ever changing.  Surprisingly nutty for a while with toasted oats and honey.  Maybe a bit of fresh grass here as well.

Conclusion:  The nose on this whiskey is phenomenal... Like a refreshing lemonade on a hot day.  The nose is definitely the dominating characteristic of this, though the taste is interesting as well.  On all accounts, I'd consider this a great summer sipping whiskey - fresh lemonade, fresh cut grass, light honey - all so perfect for summer."

4.25,"I try to keep a few expressions of every kind of whiskey at home at any given time for variety’s sake and I must admit that I bought this to round out my collection, the reviews were favorable, and I didn’t feel like paying $85 for Yellow Spot (though I’m sure it’s lovely). 

It’s rumored that Knappogue Castle sources their spirit from Old Bushmills, which is perfectly fine with me because who doesn’t like Bushmills? This dram is also on my radar only because I was watching Ralfy review the Bushmills 10 and recommend this dram over that (bless you Ralfy for all the good work you do from one malt mate to another). 

The Distiller review hits this one on the head. Easy to drink with Irish triple distilled smoothness and a bouquet of honey on the nose. The palate gives you this caramel, nougaty taste (no doubt from the bourbon barrels. What did they do before bourbon barrels in Scotland and Ireland I wonder...). The finish is smooth and satisfying, the way you expect a Irish whiskey to be. All together a highly agreeable dram with a 12 year age statement. I’m bumping up my score a bit for the elegant and stylish bottle design as well. A great value for a quality single malt from an independent bottler if you can find it. Cheers!"

4.0,"This is pretty nice.  Overall it's a honey-apple flavor, light and sweet with a hint of tartness.  In some ways it is similar to Glenmorangie 10, but I like this a good bit more, because the flavor and finish continue sweet, not turning sour towards the end as I found with Glenmorangie.  The only problem is this cost me $50.  It's good, but probably not good enough to warrant spending that much again.  Maybe once in a while."
4.0,Green apples laffy taffy on the nose.   Taste is sweet honey and vanilla. Finish is light with lingering honey
3.5,"All fruit on the nose. A little hot for the abv. Very tasty and fruity (particularly stone fruit) behind oak and vanilla, not overly complex but pleasant. The finish and aftertaste is short, but all stone fruit. Very approachable for new whiskey drinkers."

4.0,"So I expect a few dislikes on this comment.  I am a bourbon fan.  I used to not like Irish whiskeys.  However, I recently tried this one and was very pleased with how light and yet flavorful it was.  I am having one now on a Sunday afternoon.  The flavor and nose up front is great (similar to Green spot but not quite as fragrant, more on that one later), however, the finish is a bit short/weak.  So as my per my usual, if I find a good bottle at a higher price point, I Iook for the lower price alternative.  After much comparison, I bought Black Bush vs. Black Barrel and compared.  While Black Bush is more like an Irish/ Bourbon, if did not have the fragrance or taste of Knappogue Castle....so in a state of tast testing, I decided to blend both together...I know, right, hate mail...but in the right amounts in a glass, I found the best of both worlds.  Actual blend depends on preference and I do it by glass to try things over time.....  But Knappogue 12 year will always be on my shelf."

4.25,Maybe top 5 Irish whiskeys I have ever had.   Nose is weak but the palate goes into Scotland.  Smooth taste with grassy notes and ending with mild bourbon sweetness.   The finish disappears quickly.

4.0,"Nose: Apples. Spices. Malty. Some ethanol. Not much going on in the nose.

Palate: Very smooth. Smokey and dry. Caramel and spice blending nicely. A hint of taffy. Tree fruits lingering as well. Very pleasant.

Finish: Long. Peachy sweetness coming through subtly. Some butterscotch. Malty flavor peaking through. 

Overall Thoughts: Very smooth and easy to enjoy. A delightful blend of flavors that are subtle enough to keep the taster guessing. A gentle whiskey that I’m glad to keep in my collection from now on. A drop of water helps a bit too. Very much looking forward to trying more from Knappogue!"

3.5,"Nose is sweet and spicy with malty/bread notes and a little ethanol. Body is medium viscosity and sweet, with a sweet lingering finish that has just a bit of alcohol burn. I didn't like this one very much when I first opened the bottle (didn't seem worth $50 compared to Scotches at that price), but it's grown on me as I'm reaching the end of the bottle. Interested to try other offerings from this distillery."
