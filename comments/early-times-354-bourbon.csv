4.0,"Mellow sipper. Classic caramel, kettle corn aromas. Packs a nice punch for being 80 Proof. They don’t make this one anymore folks. If you see it, buy it!"

4.0,"Honestly, when i picked up a bottle of this, i'd assumed it was going to be terrible. But, well, sometimes you have to get a cheap bottle. lo and behold, it was actually quite good! great flavor, and very smooth. for a bottle under $20, it's solid."

3.0,"Super cheap, but it's a surprising bang-for-your-buck flavor. Considering other whiskeys in this price range, there's not a huge amount of alcohol burn - just decent, predictable bourbon flavor. It's not a particularly memorable dram, but maybe that's not an altogether terrible thing. Not every sip needs to make you ponder the universe."

1.0,"The nose is full of alcohol and the slightest fruitiness. The taste is one note, just oak. There is no finish to speak of. I can see why this was discontinued."
3.0,Mild and easy to drink.  Much better than their standard.
