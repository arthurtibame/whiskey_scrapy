5.0,Huge fan of this. Love the strong full flavor profile with a beautiful blend of bourbon and Japanese whisky flavors. Huge fan. If only I could find a bottle to buy...
5.0,"Very nice dram with notes of toasted vanilla, tropical fruits like banana, mango, passion fruit and coconut, caramel, sandalwood, chocolate, peach, cherries, and spices. Rough at edges at first but smoothens over time. Reminds me of an Asian Barry Crockett."
