4.0,Not nearly as smoky as the rest of the line. Mouthfeel and finish are almost closer to what I might stereotype as a Highlands profile. Prunes.

4.0,"Strong on the nose with notes of strong peaty smoke and fired oak. On the pallets it is surprisingly less hard hitting with strong notes of peat, smoke, iodine and oak. Small undertones of dark forest fruit."
