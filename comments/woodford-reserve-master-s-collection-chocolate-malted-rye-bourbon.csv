4.75,Excellent. As described—chocolate rye prominent.
4.25,"Nose: Mocha, small amounts of Caramel, hints of Cedar, small amounts of Oak, Fruit, and roasted nut.

Flavor: Roasted rye, Dark Chocolate Spice, Mocha, Cherry, and Toasted Oak.

The finish is long. Overall Fantastic!!!"
4.5,"I’m no expert and I’ll admit I’m unpredictably critical of the finer things, but this is damn good!!!

Nose: fresh baked banana bread, holiday cookies and toasted nuts.

Palate: cocoa shining through to dry rye.

Finish: medium long with mocha and coffee.

I was full on expecting this to be a sweet novelty, but this is cocoa forward with enough restraint to really enjoy the corn and the rye. I tend to favor higher proofs but 90.4 showcases the complexity."

4.5,"The cocoa finish is what makes this special. Almost like taking a small spoon of cocoa powder and letting it dissolve in your mouth.  Definitely more typical Woodford rye with a light spiciness. Not sure it is worth $150 a bottle, but it is definitely a nice sipper."

4.25,"I didn’t enjoy the first glass much or get the chocolate. Once it opens up the chocolate flavor rises. Has a real earthy note as well. Enjoyed the uniqueness, not like anything else I have had. Bought second bottle for that fact alone as something different to enjoy from time to time."

4.25,The most chocolatey bourbon I’ve ever had. Excellent dessert finish drink.
1.5,"So I may not be the best person to rate this as I seem to avert malted whiskies for the most part.  I will give it a try and tell you how I see it.  Here we go (sigh).

The nose is earthy.  I do get chocolate but it seems like chocolate rolled in dirt.  There is a dankness to the nose.

The palate is best described as if I were eating clay and I am definately NOT a fan of clay!  Then the sweetness came in.  But not a nice even sweetness.  This was as if a chocolate granola bar got dipped in rubbing alcohol and then rolled around in dirt......and I was now drinking it!

I have had other malted whiskies and found them enjoyable.  This one though......not a fan."
2.75,Tastes young but also woodsy/astringent at the same time. I do get a cacao note. The Woodford sharp note is there. A bit of cologne. 11/28/19
4.5,"Nose like walking into an old pancake house.  Several flavors on the palate, chocolate like a tootsie roll very present, with a refreshing winter pine at the finish. Enjoyed."

4.25,Very good! You do get a hint of dark chocolate mid sip. Other than that a nice rye spice and some leather.
3.75,"Dark chocolate, coffee, oak"
4.25,Great chocolate after taste. Best whiskey I’ve had. Sweet on the front of the tongue. The key is to exhale after you swallow (dark chocolate).

3.5,"Tonight's Whiskey of the day is a unique limited release from Woodford. I absolutely loved the batch proof and enjoyed the Oat grain for what it was. With this release the Mashbill is unique (70% Corn, 15% Chocolate Malted Rye and 15% malted barely). The Chocolate Malted Rye component was where they roasted the rye malt to the point that it caramelized to create a chocolate note. Let's dive into the tasting:

On the palette it's rich and pretty viscous for the proof. Coffee, Cocoa, Vanilla and barrel spice all hit you. It's a pretty complex and satisfying experience. The finish is fairly short and the chocolate note is pretty pronounced on the finish that is also pretty astringent. 

So would I buy it? It's interesting, at the Costco price of under $80 I think I probably would just because of how unique it is. It's definitely a fun and complex experience. This is one for the adventurous and not one who wants classic Bourbon notes! 

Cheers all!"
3.75,"Very aromatic on uncork.
Allowed to breathe for 5 minutes. Single poured and tasted neat. Very obvious chocolate note on finish. The alternate finish seemed chalky and almost fake. Potent. Will weigh headache possibility."

4.25,Earthy notes like many ryes. Grain notes with awesome dark chocolate finish.
4.25,"So, today I messed up. I went to one of my local stops to see what new bottles may have appeared since the last time I had been there. Important to note, they keep most of their allocated items behind the counter which has a shelf and plexiglass on one side to act as a display, but the requires you to ask the cashier to get the bottle for you. I was looking through the plexiglass beyond the display items and saw on a counter behind the register the Woodford Master's bottles. They had them lined up in two rows and they hadn't been there just three days ago, I'm excited. I go to the register and request ""the Woodford"" on the back counter and ask how much. $116. Rough and out of my normal preferred range, but since I hadn't seen any other bottles at my other sources, this year or in past years, I decided to go bold. Fast-forward; I get home and want to admire the new addition, and that's when I realize I made a mistake. First, I should have been more critical of the TWO rows of the master's. I had spotted the Master's Batch Proof, but as you realize based on where I'm posting my review, I did not purchase the Batch Proof. Oof. But, I'm up for the adventure and I'm actually happy with how this turned out.

This rogue gem has a great sweet scent, as you may expect from a heavy corn bill. Hints of cocoa and cherry, too. 

The taste is first similar to the reserve, but a hint of rye spice. It quickly goes to the chocolate and cherry flavors, but in a very smooth transition. I'd quickly point out that this is NOT a flavored bourbon, nor a rye, really, but the flavors stem from the roast that emulates the chocolate and cherry flavors. If you're not a fan of chocolate or cherry, sample at a bar, but don't get a bottle. Personally, I'm a big fan. The finish is a lighter percent dark chocolate, cherry cordial, and together reminds me of a hot cocoa cereal.

Lesson learned, read the dern label if I don't grab the bottle of the shelf. In my defense I was excited for the find and hungry given it was 1pm and I had yet to eat lunch."
1.0,"Nose: Nuts, Cedar and some musty funkiness I can not describe.
Taste: Notes of Roasted Coffee and Chocolate, Cedar
Easily one of the worst Bourbons I ever tasted - luckily it was only a sample and I did not buy a whole bottle"
4.75,Delicious and well done. A bit pricey but worth the purchase. Tastes oddly similar to The Glenmorangie Signet scotch. Very creamy feel with lots of dark wood and chocolate notes.

4.5,"To start, I’m not a woodford fan at all. It’s okay a good product but not my favorite. With that being said, this bottle is absolutely delicious. It is a rye but doesn’t taste like a rye. It’s got tastes of chocolate and cherry and well worth the price"

4.75,Harsh upfront but as it opens up one of the best out there
4.0,"Much longer review I was writing just disappeared so this is the summary - it is a flavor boomerang.  You get WRs signature cereal/limestone/sharp earthy aroma with more toasted grain notes and a warm, typical WR palate.  

The finish seems timid at first and then 4-6 seconds later when you think it’s faded you get a wave of cocoa nibs and faint leather.  It’s amazing.  It’s all about the finish - and the cocoa lasts for minutes.  Christmas dram for me, and an excellent one at that!"

3.5,"Very interesting. Would put as an example of unique, high quality American whiskey. Rivaling equally-priced options from Scotland."
4.0,"The chocolate is not flavoring, which some have thought when I tell them about this, but happened as part of the distilling process.  For me, I smell butter, wood, and some leather with mild sweetness on the nose, and the same on the taste. The finish is a very subtle cocoa nib / chocolate after the exhale, not super sweet and seems just right."

4.5,"I am not a chocolate drink fan, but this one just hits right for me.  tabacco, caramel, then at the end a hint of cocoa (like when you have a chocolate truffle with the cocoa on top)  Weird but I liked it so much I had to get a second bottle.  Over ice, straight didn't release the same.  Surprised me."
1.5,"Aroma is a soft dessert-sweet profile with some rustic hints that struggle to be noticed; Palate has a raw essence to it that reminds me of far too many of the not-so-great craft distilleries; Finish is short, harsh and metallic. Can’t say I like the end result, but I like that it exists"

2.75,I really did not care for this. I'm not even gonna give it a full tasting because it tasted like cocoa puffs with whiskey... and not in a good way.
4.75,"Nose of mocha or a fine chocolate to coffee and a touch of oak. Taste of dark chocolate and mocha, dry rye. Finish for me is chocolate."
3.5,Mild earthy nose. Rich cocoa and tobacco hit the middle of your palate. Almost creamy. If you drank it blindfolded you might almost guess to was a liqueur. Shorter finish. No burn whatsoever. Extremely unique. Not something to drink on a regular basis.

4.25,"When had neat, slight heat with notes of char, tobacco, chocolate and caramel. When cut with ice, the heat is reduced and the flavors open up.  Char, tobacco, chocolate, caramel, and nut come together in a symphony of flavor. A must have in the collection."
4.25,Smooth chocolate note on the nose. Neat - minimal burn with a hint of chocolate and nut. Over a single large ice cube- more chocolate flavor with zero burn. After taste is smooth chocolate with a nutty vanilla taste. Definitely going to add it to the collection.

4.25,"Nose - Dark chocolate notes, toasted rye spice, dusty rye grains, caramel, flamed cinnamon

Taste - Dark toasted rye/grains, chocolate mocha rye bread, chocolate roasted barley, mocha bread, bit drying, dark caramels, light cinnamon spice

Finish - Lingering tingle, chocolate yeasty bread notes dominate, mocha bread from 85C Bakery chain

Score - 87/100

Final Thoughts - I actually quite liked this as it actually reminded me of a rye that I can no longer get. This tastes oddly similar to Woodinville Whiskey's old microbarreled rye offering. This has very similar chocolaty notes to the rye that make it quite desserty. This is definitely not an everyday dram as the chocolate notes can be a bit overwhelming on their own. I think this would be best paired with a berry dessert, a hearty stout, or mixed into an old fashioned or a manhattan.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - Not another"
