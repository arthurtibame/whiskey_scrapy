4.25,"Recieved this beauty as a gift and it's been a Kilchoman expression I have long been interested in!

For the 8th edition Kilchoman is a vatting of 23 bourbon barrels and 7 oloroso sherry butts filled between 2008 and 2012, bottled at 50% ABV. This marked the first time this expression included sherry matured malt. It's also peated at a lower peat level of 20ppm versus 50ppm from the core range. Let's dive into the tasting:

It enters very rich with a big fruit salad note! Both fresh and grilled fruits. Dark chocolate and cinnamon follow with a pretty pronounced earthy peat note interwoven. Rich vanilla leads to a big and long  finish with more fruit and peat smoke notes! Despite the lower PPM this one is much peatier to me than the Sanaig or Machir Bay. 

All in all this really has everything you want in an Islay and one I will struggle not keep pouring! 

Cheers all!!"

On the nose, nice discrete kilchoman peat.

On the palate, citrus, peat and sherry spice.

On the finish, oaky and peaty with good medium length"
