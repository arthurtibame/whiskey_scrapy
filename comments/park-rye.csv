3.0,"Arizona Distilling Company is one of the first craft distilleries in AZ and is now bottling their own aged whiskey.
Park Rye Whiskey carries no age statement but since the label states ""straight"" that means it is at least 2 years old. Love the aesthetic of the bottle, looks like it is made of sugar glass in similar style to High West bottles, with the distillery name molded in relief around the top of the bottle.
Mashbill is 95% rye and instead of malted barley the other grain is 5% durum wheat which is grown locally in southern Arizona.
On the nose you get sour fruit such as green apples as well as pencil eraser with a hint of earthy note at the end that is reminiscent of dry dirt or soil. The palate is very interesting and unique from most other ryes I've tasted. You get the same ""earthy"" flavor a bit, then more floral notes and green apple, followed by rubber tire that turns into hot chili pepper flavor and spice. On the finish, the chili pepper changes to black pepper as it fades.
Most mashbills typically contain a little bit of malted barley because it has a high count of naturally occurring enzymes that kick start the fermentation process. Since AZ Distilling uses durum wheat instead, it probably means enzymes were added. It would be interesting to know if it is the wheat versus malted barley or the added enzymes that gives Park Rye the unique flavor. Maybe a little of both? Here's an article from The Whiskey Wash that discusses this topic:
