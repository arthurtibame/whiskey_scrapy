3.75,Really smooth and excellent. Best drink chilled.
5.0,"Don’t let the “expert” fool you into thinking this is a bland bourbon. While it is a little more mild than recent bourbons in punch, it is just as good as the 12 year Dewar’s my wife and I just tasted with it. Great for sipping neat. A good contrast to the Jim Beam Black label."

3.0,Surprisingly tasty!
3.75,"Great nose, a little lighter than standard Beam with more orchard fruit. Intense caramel is still there. On the palate, very woodsy, the oak is prominent, almost like sandalwood, but not unpleasant. Sweet, smooth, with vanilla, minty notes, slight bitterness at the end to balance. Very drinkable. 3/24/18"
