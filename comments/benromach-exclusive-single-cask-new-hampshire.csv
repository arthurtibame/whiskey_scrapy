3.75,"Picked up one of 221 bottles from barrel 377 on my recent trip to the granite state. Box states “sweet honey with hints of tropical fruits & berries complimented by luscious light peat smoke” 
I first tried this neat and I have to say, it is very smooth and the ABV at 59.9% is well hidden. I was very surprised at how much peat I got on the nose, not typical of a Speyside at all, smells more like an Islay. The palate started off slightly sweet and I could get a touch of the honey and some fruit but I would not call it tropical. The peat slowly worked it’s way in towards the end and was much more balanced than the nose suggested. Had a moderate spicy finish with some sweetness coming back at the very end.
Adding a touch of water opened up the fruits a little bit and balanced out the peat even more. Although I was expecting a summer sipper, I ended up getting something I think I would rather have on a fall night around a camp fire. Overall, a nicely balanced scotch that I am happy to have in my collection!"
