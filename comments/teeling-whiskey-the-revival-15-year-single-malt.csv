4.0,"Revival I, a brilliant use of rum casks has given this gem of a 15 year old whiskey lovely tropical fruit highlights that bounce off a solid and well rounded base. Hints of papaya and mango intermingle with coconut and condensed milk to build up to a lengthy finish of mixed peel and wisps of smoke."

4.0,Spectacularly good rum cask whisky.  Complexity and flavour abundant. I suspect we are paying a premium for the packaging and bottle though.

4.0,"Strikingly different from its siblings the bottle grabs your attention right away. The nose is sweet with an unexpected allure that draws you in for more. Sweet, subtle dried fruits with a butter finish. Ideally should be consumed on a grassy knoll in County Kildare over looking the local fields."

4.0,"Visual:  Light amber/gold color. Medium legs that take their time sliding into the glass.

Nose:  Delightful nose of citrus fruit, Juicy Fruit gum, vanilla, caramel, and baking spices. Slightly earthy.

Palate: Sweet and rich. It is not as grainy as the Teeling Small Batch, which I tasted alongside. It is darker, with a nuttier profile. There are some tropical fruit notes, as well. I detect papaya. I have a papaya tree in my backyard, and I sometimes notice an almost smoky character to the fruit, along with a richness and earthiness. I get those same vibes from the Revival. 

Finish: The finish is relatively long and warming – with the warmth expected from the 46% ABV, with less of a bite than the Small Batch, likely the result of longer maturation. The finish is less bitter than the Small Batch. Barrel spices are infused in the finish, which is longer than the Small Batch. Breathing back through the nose, more papaya is detected. 

Empty glass: Oak and toffee.

I really like this whiskey. I wish I could find it locally. If I could give it a 4+ or a 5-, I would. I think I’ll stick to 4 stars; but a strong, solid 4 stars."

4.0,"Lovely lemon and straw scents on the nose. A delicate fruity palate -- think melon and pear -- that quickly cedes the spotlight to zesty wood and spice. The finish is long, with a sweet kick at the end. This is a complex whiskey that I would never have identified as Irish tasted blind. In the same class as the bottle of Yellow Spot I turn to when I'm in the mood for something different. Count me as another grateful beneficiary of the Pranay Whisky Wealth Redistribution Fund."

4.5,"Irish whiskey is known for its fruity flavors and they are turned up to 11 in this release sourced from the Cooley distillery. Apricots and peaches on the nose develop in the mouth into juicy stone fruits mingled with a delightful spice. The finish is long and spicy. I typically find rum cask maturations too sweet or sickly, but this one tastes more like it was drawn from a peach juice container. Really good."
4.0,"I sat down with a friend the other night and pulled this bottle out. It seems every time I have a dram of this whisky, I appreciate it more and more. It’s packed full of flavour and I much more complex than most Irish whisky that I have had."

4.0,"I have taken a liking to Irish whiskey as a (slight) alternative to Scotch.  When tasting Irish whiskey, I have to remind myself that, though Irish and Scotch whiskey are inherently the same, they are not the same; they are cousins.  That being said, I do try to compare apples to apples (or Irish to Irish) for comparative/experience purposes.  That being said, this Teeling ranks high in my Irish experience.

Pale straw in color, the nose is initially greeted with tropical notes, from the rum casks.  This fades to a sweet cereal (Frosted Flakes), dried pineapple and honey.  Rightly sweet.  The first sip is instantly drying and spicy which causes an initial surprised reaction given the sweet nose.  The sweeter side does eventually come through.  Pears, honey, vanilla and a touch of brown sugar along with some herbal notes of ginger along with a pinewood-like quality.  A zingy sensation remains on the palate with a medium length finish.  Drying, with all the qualities previously experienced of oak, pears, vanilla/honey and ginger ale.

As others have experienced, this has it’s cousins Scotch-like Dalwhinnie quality.  Yet, it more closely has a sibling-like quality to Knappogue Castle 14.  A very enjoyable whiskey that does not seem rushed or forced.  Teeling, in my opinion, is becoming a Irish force representing craft quality in Irish whiskey.

Lastly, I greatly appreciate Sir Pranay’s generosity allowing me the fortune of tasting this whiskey. Also as well as many others that I would have difficulty attaining or encountering.  In addition, I find that this Distiller community has really encouraged the whisk(e)y experience for us all.  It is nice to see the sharing of each of our personal stocks, without hesitation and with great pleasure.  [Dry Glass: Butterscotch][90/100][Tasted: 1/28/17]"
5.0,"Nose: Pear cider, crushed pineapple, fragrant honey, fresh cut green pepper, dry white wine, ginger ale. Palate: starts with juicy sweet pear, then develops into zesty, spicy oak. Finish: less sweet, floral and looming resinous wood. From the total impression, it's character is somewhere betwixt Dalwhinne and a Macallan Fine Oak series (two old friends)... Many-long thanks to the skookum Pranay for the sample! Dry glass: strawberry ice-cream."

4.0,"Smooth, light honey, reminds me of dalwhinnie.  Hints of rum, alcohol bite follows in the finish.   Good Irish whisky."
5.0,"It's time to try another Irish whiskey:  Teeling Whiskey Co's The Revival.  It's 15 years old and spent a considerable amount of time in ex-rum casks.  This one comes in at a slightly elevated 92 proof and is straw yellow in the tasting glass.

The nose is pretty pungent, lots of vanilla and rum dominate here.  There's some soft floral and sweet coconut hidden behind that rum.  I had to give it a vigorous swirl and immediately slam my nose in there to really detect it, but it is there.

On the palate, you get slammed quickly by oak and spices and hot, hot heat.  The heat really attacks the tongue but it doesn't burn the nose like a cask strength.  It's just a lengthy, zesty burn.  It's quite different than any other Irish whiskey I've ever had.  It's an eye opener and very enjoyable.  The finish is incredibly long and hot.  As your tongue finally begins to cool a bit you're left with a final, spicy blast that I actually had to chase away with a bit of water.  Holy hell, now that's what an Irish whiskey should taste like.  Beautiful.

I'm not sure what an entire bottle costs or how difficult it is to locate one to buy.  I'd like to have more, no doubt, but that said I don't think I could drink more than a single dram in one whisky sipping session.  It's very powerful stuff.  Thanks to Pranay for generously supplying this delicious sample.  Cheers."
4.0,"I'm not a huge fan of Irish whiskey, but this one intrigued me.   I had a dram of this tonight after having a dram of Macallan 15 PX cask, and the differences couldn't be any greater.  This was definately less elegant, but more fruity and sweet.  I actually couldn't smell any aromas, but that was probably because I had just had the Macallan.  On the palette,  definitely sweeter---papayas, mangoes, and coconuts.  Quite smooth, leaving a sweet finish.   Out of the Irish, this was by far my favorite (I've only had Redbreast 12, Green spot, Yellow spot, and  Teeling single grain.  I dont think this is available in the US, but if your travels take you abroad, it's worth seeking out"
