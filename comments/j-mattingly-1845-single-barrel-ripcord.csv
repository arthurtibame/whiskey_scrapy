4.0,"Neat.  Neck pour.  Comes across more like a rum on the nose in many ways.  Almond, cinnamon glaze, butterscotch, cherry, chocolate.  Lots of rich and deep flavors.

Creamy mouth feel.  Cinnamon and brown sugar dominate the tongue with butterscotch oozes towards the fringes. It’s almost like eating a box of chocolate in one sitting back to back.  Cherry cordial.  Butterscotch filled.  Cream filled with the almond on top.  Each pass is a different chocolate.  Chocolate and vanilla linger on the finish for quite awhile.

Every once in awhile I get a funky note.  It’s not a turn off per se.  More distracting and then I try to explore it more trying to place a description on it.  I feel like I have gotten this note before in St.Cloud except I actually want to drink it.  

I enjoyed this one.  It was fun to explore and kept me exploring for 30 minutes.  I know the rumors and back story about this brand and tried to go into this with an open mind.  I’m walking away happy I explored it but also doubting it’s a bourbon I will crave to come back to."
