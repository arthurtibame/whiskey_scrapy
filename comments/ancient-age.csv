2.0,$12.99 in VA. You get a little more than you pay for here. Good mixer and entry level bourbon. Glass bottle with plastic twist off. Really can't find anything negative to say about this bourbon relative to its price.

2.0,"The nose is rough but the taste has dark chocolate and coffee notes. It finishes with very little burn but with some bitterness. For less than $20, I don't see an issue here."
1.0,"One thing I've noticed in these bottom shelf bourbons is their similarity to Tennessee Whiskeys. Lots of char, a little banana sweetness and not much else. Mixed well with ginger ale...passable on the rocks and neat. For $5 less, I can get Heaven Hills which has about the same flavor profile. For the same price I can get Benchmark, which has a lot more character. Tried it...it was okay...but feel there are better options for the same or less money."

2.0,"Good basic 80-proof. Mild, sweet corn, with touch of rye and char - soft short finish. Thin and not much there, but also nothing objectionable. Similar to stablemate Benchmark, but just not as interesting to my palate.  My 2 stars are really 2.5, as this is a great value. I had some after some Bushmills (at nearly 2x price) and enjoyed this more."

Tastes watered down, but what bourbon should be. Hard to find distinct flavors, but it's not too bad; avoids the back burn of bad whiskeys."

3.0,Light and dry. This is a nice bourbon to cut your teeth on. Both the aroma and palate are light but pleasant. Mild wood influence makes for something mostly sweet but a little spicy. This would make for a nice aperitif for a meal or good opening drink for the evening.
4.0,"Surprisingly not too bad for the $9.89! I paid for the bottle. Not my favorite, but I wouldn’t say no to this again.  I still prefer Evan Williams Black Label for my Bottom Shelf Bliss, but this comes in glass or plastic and I think the plastic bottle is the way to go for outings."

2.5,"Very good smell caramel and vanilla.   Not much to the taste, a bit watery with no body.   Very smooth without burn.  Wanted to try the less aged version of buffalo trace high rye #2 that also makes Blanton’s and Elmer T Lee.   Pretty good for $13."
2.25,"Smells lightly of honey, slight bourbon burn on nose. Tastes exactly like it smells maybe a little more aggressive."

Great bourbon for the price ($11 in NC).  Would buy for a party or a camping trip or a cheap sipper to have on hand."
2.75,All the flavor of your favorite Buffalo Trace mash bill.  Problem is you only it taste for a few seconds.

3.0,"Pretty darn tasty for a $12 bottle. Little sweet caramel, brown sugar, and vanilla. 3.25"
2.0,"Color: The color on this bourbon is a deep copper. Its legs are thin but stick to the inside of the glass for a bit.

Nose: The nose is sweet with obvious front leading aroma of corn, followed by notes of cherry candy, wildflowers, and a hint of vanilla. The floral notes only get stronger as you sit with it.

Taste: The taste is a bit thin and unremarkable. But it has sweet honey on the palate as well as oak and corn. Basically it’s a pretty basic bourbon.

Finish: The finish on the end is clingy and has some spiciness. It definitely linger with you for a while, then slowly dissipates.

Opinion: This was one of the first bourbons I ever had. My dad let me try some one Christmas break after I turned 21 or 22. I liked it and this bourbon has a place in my memory and heart because of that. However, after a bit more experience (though I would be no means consider myself a whiskey expert yet) I think this dram is a bit boring and simple. I believe it is a good starting point for one who is just wanting to get into bourbon, but beyond that it’s just a fine uncomplicated dram that would probably do really well in any whiskey cocktail. Sláinte!"

2.25,"I has heard that Ancient Age was some of the original whiskey created by the legendary Elmer T Lee whilst reading about his centenary. 

His legacy does not live on in this whiskey. It's not that it's a terrible pour, but it certainly falls flat for me after hearing its history. Perhaps if you find bottles from years past it is better. 

The nose is light and smells faintly of butterscotch and toasted nuts. 

The taste is thin, with some light caramel and sweet corn and fades quickly to a slight ethanol burn and little else."

2.25,"Nose of corn, butterscotch, and ethanol. Palate is simple and a bit hot. No offensive tasting notes. Ice mellows the heat. Very acceptable in non-booze heavy cocktails. For the price of $12 I’m ok with this."
2.75,"Scores higher than it should because of the value and price, but it’s a must-but for $13"
3.0,Buffalo Trace MB#2.  Barrels that don't become Blantons become this.  Sure there's more to it but that's what I gather.  Proof down Blantons to 80 and it tastes like AA.

2.75,"I have had this bourbon several times and while there are worse ones on the market there are also better ones for near the price point. Ancient Age has a mild nose to me and a bit of vanilla and some sugar but after that, it is just ethanol which is sad. I understand from some reviews here and some older family members that AA used to have a better deeper flavor but with the greater demand for whiskey so many older labels have gone to younger blends. Where I live you can buy Evan Williams 1783 for three dollars more than AA and it tastes so much better. I will not buy this again and what I have left I will just mix with coke or ginger ale."
