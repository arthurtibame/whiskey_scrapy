4.0,"Nose: A very unique fragrance, a mix of bananas, honey, unripened lemon zest. Nutmeg with a hint of peanut oil appear with a delicate vanilla flower note. Apples are very apparent, but a green apple (green jolly rancher) with white grapes and a light salt note. The nose is very dry, white and green fruit notes are predominant, similar almost to a light champagne. Adding water really brings out an herbal note, reminiscent of walking through a vegetable garden.

Palate: A heavier sweetness comes in the taste, overpowering honey and white grapes, the sauternes influence almost makes you think you're tasting white wine. Delicate and floral with the lightness and bitterness of lemon rinds. Very dry feeling on the tongue and easy going considering the 50% ABV.

Finish: Medium length with a slight oak, even more so after adding water"
1.0,"Odd after taste, not as smooth"

Ízre az édesség dominál, kissé citrusos, fűszeres, a vége izgalmasan csokis."
2.5,"Very nice fruity aroma of apricots and peaches. Some honey and caramel, too. The high alcohol degree is easy to feel and this imbalances the drink."

4.0,"Nose - Bit hot on the nose, sweet desserty white wine, riesling-like, apple/pear undertones

Taste - Nice initial soft heat that builds up to a ginger/white pepper heat/tingle, light fruity/crisp/bright desserty white wine, golden raisins, floral honey, muscat grapes, dark apple juice

Finish - Linger tingle/heat, fruity grape sweet, grape gummies, floral honey, ginger spice

Score - 84/100

Final Thoughts - The nose on this one was a bit muted due to the ethanol heat, but it was pretty pleasant. It was a bit hot on the tongue as well but once that tingle subsided, you were rewarded with a nice rush of fruity floral desserty white wine goodness. It has this nice muscat like ""must"" but the sweetness is scaled back like a riesling or a viognier. Nice Scotch overall, a tiny bit of water does tame the heat a bit but it does seem to make it a bit more dry/tannic somehow.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Maybe

Would I buy a bottle? - Maybe"
4.0,"I'm not a huge fan of sauterne finished whiskys however I tasted a flight of several Arran whiskys and this was my favorite. Very drinkable neat at 50%, and has lovely viscosity. It would be good to try against other distillery whiskies as I suspect although I gave this a 4 as it was the best on the night I'm not a huge Arran distillery fan so it may not  measure up to other whiskies I rate a 4"

4.0,"Doux, agréable,"
null,"Had this next to glenfiddich 21 - this took the cake. Rich oily mouth feel- sweet and complex palate, very dessert esq. (with many of the notes others listed 🥴) and the best part of this whisky: the Finish - it lasts forever. . Try it and you won’t be disappointed

Knowing what I know now about the depths of scotch - the whole “-pappy-“ thing can eat a dick - with a magical $60 bottle like this; forget standing in lines -practically overnight- competing against rabid millennial bourbon nerdo fanboys- I’ll choose the comfort of my home with a freshly packed bowl and a nice smooth scotch any day. 🤷🏼‍♂️🥃"
3.75,"Interesting Sauternes cask finish. Characteristic sweet & fruity Arran, with a hint of added sweetness. Sweet, creamy finish. Drank at 1824 Discovery Primea"
3.25,"Nose has a strong red wine smell with hints of honey and stone fruits. A small hint of salinity. 

A very sharp taste with a strong spice. Lots of roasted, oaky flavour with an almost citrus-y background note, which gets stronger as it finishes. 

Long linger and a strong finish."

4.25,"Nose: Sweet, heavy floral woody notes. Muesli and vanilla yoghurt drizzled with manuka honey ; tropical flowers in a hothouse (hibiscus and frangipani) that are dusky and almost stifling in their fleshy, dank aromatic presence. Lemon zest, pineapple, banana, stone fruits (apricot, nectarine, peach), some orchard fruit. What a seductress of a nose!

Palate: Sweet arrival - very sweet, almost syrupy. The development brings out a flood of warm spicy notes that unfold like a glowing blanket, build to an almost-but-not-quite hot crescendo, and then subside to mild warmth. The texture is oily and dense and carries a host of sweet fruity and floral flavours. The seduction is complete - I submit!

Finale: Medium. Sweet cereal, citrus and malty notes fade to a mild bittersweet aftertaste that is quite excellent. Standing ovation.

The sauternes-fu is strong with this one. Whew, so much dessert wine influence! I know from the horse's mouth that Arran likes to use wet casks, but these must still have had liters of sauternes sloshing around in them. You'd be forgiven for thinking this would produce something franken-awful, but not at all. It's delicious and amazingly fresh and vigorous.

However, don't bring expectations of po-faced elegance to the gunfight, because you'll be dead in the sand. This is all Mae West, showing her sassiest and most sophisticated side. Yee-ha! Is that a pistol in your pocket or are you just pleased to see me?

This is the first of three reviews, tasting the cask-finished trio from Arran. We're off to a blazing start. This is a stunning whisky (tasted from a 30ml sample)

""Very Good"" : 4.25 stars"
3.0,"Lemon Starburst chews on the nose. Lemony in the mouth too; smooth and oily to boot. The finish is long, sweet and a little sour. Goes down easy at full strength, but a bit of water doesn’t hurt. Perfectly fine, especially when the second one is free during happy hour!"
