3.75,"A beautiful looking bottle that represents  a Kimono dress, a very drinkable whisky, which is too straightforward to be exciting. Here are my notes on Nikka Tailored that replaced the standard Nikka 12yo in 2019.

Bottled at 43%abv

On the nose it is pretty nice. Raw rice, Coffee, Toffee, dulce de leche, Tobacco, grapefruit. Feels barely young. Creme brulee. Super sweet, beautiful Capuccino note. 

On the palate is the easiest whisky to drink ever. Super fancy toffee with Pepper and that's it. Nothing else. A little boring.

Aftertaste is more of the same. pleasant spice bomb with toffee. Very friendly, but not overly exciting.

Overall this is a good, everyday whisky. Guess for a NAS that should be around 10-12yo it works. For critics and adventurers it feels too plain. 79 over 100."
3.5,"The younger brother the the Nikka 12, a little thinner but still possessing that nice sweet caramel apple freshness with a hint of spice. A little more alcohol heat too, muting some of the flavors from the nice nose."
3.75,Apple caramel nose super smooth. Mild peat smoky
3.75,"Nose is mild, malt, oak, butter, golden delicious apples. Palate arrives mildly sweet with a slight grain burn; delicate balance of oak, malt, vanilla, and grain. Finish is moderately long. Reminds me of Dewars 15 or Chivas 18 but a touch spicier, 
livelier. All told, a great blended whisky, but might still get Monkey Shoulder over this. I can only imagine what my host paid for it!"
5.0,Nose is vanilla malt and sweet apple with some smoky caramel. The palate balances a malty apple syrup mouth feel with grain spices accent nicely. Finish is medium long with lingering spice and cocoa. Not as mature as the Nikka 12 but a worthy and delicious successor in a similar style.
