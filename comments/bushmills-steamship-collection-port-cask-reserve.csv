Dear diary.... OMG! A whiskey exactly made for me. He doesn't need much to get a perfect score. Probably its shy spicy side that didn't give me the last shiver I expected. There is everything in this whisky that makes it an exceptional product. I wish I could get my hands on a bottle one of these days..."

4.0,"Light orange and spice on the nose. Sweet chocolate, honeycomb and pepper on the tongue. Decent spicy finish. Trying a taster - just googled the bottle. 100e is a bit toppy to be honest. There's 50 other whiskeys I'd buy first."
