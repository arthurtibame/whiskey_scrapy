3.5,"I believe Auchentoshan really tried to do something good here but couldn't accomplish its mission, due to the search of complexity to only find a lot of aromas that don't marry well together. 

Pale gold color, 40%abv.

In the nose is complex, but not all of the notes are likeable (At least for me). Malty, 
Grassy, Fresh aroma.
Barley, Yeast; Reminds me a lot of irish whiskies.
Lemon peel after couple of minutes.
Corn, Chocolate. It felt like a grain whisky in some parts. 

On the palate it is a lot let complex, sweet and easy drinkable. Nutty, Chocolate (reese's), Corn, Spicy Pepper.

Aftertaste is mostly sweet, like reese's chocolate, very short. 

Overall, it lacks consistency in some parts, is not a balanced dram. 70 over 100."

2.0,A friend recommended a dram. It stopped at just a dram to this day. Uneventful spicy floral lightweight. Great for summers I fathom.

2.75,"A typical Auchentoshan. Springwood obviously comes short of the intensity and complexity of the taste if comparing it to the Three Wood or even 12 yo, so this brings it closer to the basic and mediocre American Oak. But still, if I had to choose between American Oak and Springwood, I'd prefer the last one.
The aroma is intense but muted or even tender, a bit stale, spirituous, creamy, with notes of a raw egg, grass, citrus fruits, a hint of vanilla and malt.
It's sweet and chemical on the palate (though those chemicals are less pronounced when compared to the basic range): floor varnish, paint, some berries, honey, lemon zest, a little bit of alcohol, bright vanilla, heavy oak. That makes the taste truly resemble of a springtime.
The finish is fast, watery, relatively sweet with a light bitterness in the end.
In overall, this whisky is pretty average and predictable, and its components pretty much lack of complexity though I can't bring myself to call it bad. I suppose 2.75 or 3 is a fair and a proper score for this one (which one exactly depends on a mood)."
