3.25,"A hint of campfire and citrus holds all the way through the nose, the smooth and creamy palate and medium finish."

4.25,"Wonderful blended scotch. So complex that makes it so simple to taste and nose. On the nose you will find chocolate, cream, vanilla, coffee and orange. Beautiful aroma. On the palate you get a gentle spicyness which is tasty, caramel, wood, vanilla, banana and coffee. The finish is long and very pleasant. Beautiful experience. After a lot of blended whiskies, in my opinion Buchanan's has the best options and it is the best household. there is peat also somewhere in there. one of the best whiskies on the market"
