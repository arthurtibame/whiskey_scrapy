null,"Best used in a cocktail to add a depth of flavors, a very true statement, and is noted on the bottle itself. Certainly does just that. By itself, not so great though. But in fairness, the bottle warns you of intended use."

2.0,"tasted like a good tequila, bad rye.  I hope it was just an old bottle the bar was serving up.  perhaps it's meant to be something different like high west campfire. will not be adding to my collection . so unique almost encourage you to try it."

4.0,Very smooth. I like it better than most ryes
2.0,Really did not like the smell. Seemed to have this sourness to it. Tastes better after the first sip but can't get over the smell.

5.0,"One of the edgiest ryes I've yet experienced. At first taste I thought I'd sipped into a rye/single malt lovechild; the spiciness of a rye and the sharpness of a single malt. A bit daunting at first, but I warmed right up to it in no time."

4.0,"Light rye spice and chocolate greet you on the nose with a faint whiff of citrus. On the palate spice is quickly followed by malty chocolatey sweetness. The ""greenness"" shows on this whiskey but the balance of flavors really smooth it all out. For rye fans seeking an exciting new take on rye whiskey or anyone wanting to try a great craft whiskey."

3.75,"It has a nice rich sea spray smell, which is represented nicely on the palate. There is a definite chocolate richness to it that brings in sweetness. The spiciness does come through in a substantiald way, but it doesn't totally overwhelm the rest of the drink. The mineral flavor is very present too, but it merges nicely with the sea spray. It tastes fairly to h and mature despite being sweet. There are a few things going on here, though I wouldn't call it terribly complex. This would be a great choice for mixing but would also be a fine sipper. It barely even tastes like rye, but some rounded fruit comes out - apples, plums, and apricots. The present flavors are really good and the net result is well balanced and a little bit complex. There are some deficiencies with the mineral elements and it could use some more richness, but this is a really good drink. There's something a little nutty in here like peanuts or maybe cashews. Aged a bit more,this could be excellent."

3.5,It might be the glass but this is too hot on the nose for me.  It mellows out to a nice caramel on the finish WAY after the swallow.

2.75,"On sale for $35 the specs guy talked me into it. Poured neat, nose is malted milk balls and melted fudgesicle  surrounded by baking spice and mild barrel notes. Palate is similar with nestle quick, spice and wood. Nothing epic here but tasty nonetheless. Finishes out long with fading chocolate and graham cracker with some more spices and oak. It has an artificial vibe to it but I still like it. Kinda tastes like a Three Musketeers candy bar. By no means would I have pegged this as rye. It seems like a flavored whiskey but has a uniqueness that sets it apart. Probably would not repurchase but not sorry I tried it .........78/100..........basically this is chocolate whiskey for what its worth, better than it sounds and I imagine some will love this............ok so if you have a few already under your belt this is pretty nice but going in cold you will be more critical as its so different"
