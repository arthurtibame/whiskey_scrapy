4.0,"7/10.  Very Good.  Spicy Cherry Cola for me all day.  Both on the nose and the palate.  Oily mouthfeel.  Not sure if it is worth the hefty price tag, but it is a very tasty pour."
4.0,"My Rating: 3.75
Based on price, disappointed. I expected more from this. It's OK, but not worth the hype or price."
4.0,Very good. Strong flavor. Not quite a Stagg Jr but similar in style

5.0,"Dark brown color. Despite this bourbon’s high ABV, the nose is surprisingly sweet and rich. I tasted notes of caramel with a mild spice. Very good."

4.5,"Very flowery on the nose, lavender, tobacco notes. Initial honey taste, but then it gets hot. Menthol. Spicy, cayenne?"
