3.0,"I was having this while watching last night's Walking Dead.  So...my opinions may be slightly skewed,  Was a gut wrenching episode.  Okay..so...I love the aroma on the nose--a sweet caramel with some floral notes.  But, I think it falls short on the palette, just lacks the depth and complexity.  Maybe an age thing?  Finish is slightly bitter, almost like dried thyme.   Not bad.  But, nothing to write home about either."

4.0,"Very impressive offering.  Best to drink neat - adding water brings the smoke out. 
Nose: honey, mixed berry, very floral - no citrus 
Palate: on the tonge - 2.5/4 body, oily, does not change from palate. 
Finish: very wet. Stays with you. alcohol progresses forward."

3.25,"From the award-winning distillery in Taiwan, Kavalan Single Malt is their entry-level bottling. Being matured in six different cask types, the nose is reminiscent of a quality Blended Scotch. Very fruity with ripe oranges, mango and pineapple at first, the aroma turns more floral and honeyed upon adding a little water. Werther's Original drops, maple syrup and measured oak influence characterize the rather simple taste of this young malt. The finish is quick, chocolaty and slightly bitter. An interesting but very 'engineered' whisky with a hefty price tag.

4.0,"Quite enjoyable I must say. The sort of whisky I could describe as a Lowland with touches of fruit and sherry. At 40% ABV it's a tad flat and weak, however still quite flavorful. The nose and palate are, again, sherry with hints of dried fruits and honey - there's even an ever so slight touch of mangoes (quite nice). The body is regretfully not there and the finish is as short as I have ever come across for a whisky. In sum: I liked it, and would perhaps even buy it for those guests I may have who are not naturally inclined to drinking whisky."

2.0,"I didn't enjoy it, I had waited a year to try this, but it was spicy, overly dry, herby and a miserably short finish. The sweet oiliness from the heat and the coast of the distillery and the sherry cask doesn't mix with the dry, lemony spice from the bourbon and new American oak cask just doesn't work for me. Then I found the amazing Kavalan Port Cask and I finally understood why Kavalan is so popular."

4.0,"If I had to compare this to a wine, it would be like an aged chardonnay - buttery, oaky notes of vanilla and spice, plus tropical fruit and honey roasted nuts both on the nose and palate. It's a good dram, competing for me with the Ex-Bourbon Cask and Concertmaster (port cask) for top honors."

2.0,My simple reaction: why? This particular malt is just too similar to Scottish brands and comes across as a cross between Dalwhinnie and a light Dalmore. Those reviewers struggling to find a unique nose or palate are right I think. In my humble opinion I cannot taste the strand of mango that some seem to detect. What a shame. Is it there? Help! Given it is around $70 it simply cannot compare to either a Dalmore or Dalwhinnie 15 year old which are roughly the same price or less. Hope you have a better experience. 86 is a bit too high a score. Hud

4.0,"75, a 3.8 out of 5. Kavalan's single malt offering blends a Scotch's diligence and a longwinded Kentucky hug. The Taiwanese distillery is struggling to find markey share in the shadow of the Japanese whiskey boom, but not from a lack of quality. While the take home price of a bottle in the states is not likely worth it, Kavalan does show off an impressive mutation in style. A less than exciting nose gives birth to a palate of cinnamon apples and sandalwood  crescendoing into a long dip in a pool of honey. The nose and the palate are mere stepping stones to a beautiful finish from an abnormally young whiskey. I'm intrigued by the emerging region's interpretation of the water of life. I will reevaluate in a few years. Definitely worth the dram, maybe not the bottle: at least not yet."

Palate: Big, rich waves of Sherry right off the back. Washing out into bright grape sweetness. Roasted almonds and chocolate-covered marzipan. The finish is short and quick, coming on with pink peppercorns and rapidly fading into a dry sweet end.

Thoughts: It's cool to see the effects a hot humid climate can have on a whisky. There is a lot to like here for such a young Malt. The tropical melon notes, the bright citrus, and honey. There's a delicate floral note both in nose and palate that have a definitive tropical style to them. All in all this whisky is easy drinking, and something decidedly different from the usual Scotch style offerings. Novices and seasoned veterans alike will find something to like here."

You will finish with a bit of dry wood bitterness like a black tea lingers in your mouth."

5.0,"I want to believe that i have a moral obligation to rate whiskies not for what i like but for what they are. This is one of those cases. My first Kavalan, the taiwanese awarded malt, gave me some interesting things to write about and a moral dilemma, whether to give it a 5.0 or not, because i really think it is a masterpiece, just not MY masterpiece.

Bottled at 57.8%abv, with a chesnut oloroso sherry color. Yes, it is a cask strenght, yes it hits your face like a nuclear spice bomb.

On the nose it might just be one of the best drams ever, so complex and rich, sweet and wonderful. So many notes, so much going on there. Fresh banana, vanilla, cinnamon, banana ice cream, prunes, lemon, coconut (first time i find this on a dram), pine tree, pancakes, cocoa powder, an dim blackberry marmalade note,  are the aromas i got from this baby. Truly a work of art and i believe it only has 5yo of maturation, but, due to Taiwan's tropical climate, the process is faster. On the nose it fools you as if it were a cold dram, that is a feeling i got from it.

On the palate is just too strong to have it neat. I drank it all neat and it was great and also difficult. A very dim caramel and apricot note starts the experience to turn into an inmidiate NUCLEAR SPICE BOMB. Very hot, a lot of barley and cereal notes, there are some oranges there but hidden, ashes, tobbacco, pepper, cinnamon, clove, vanilla cake, all spice is the main note. It is so powerful that in my first sip it forced me to involuntary close one eye. It is a full palate experience, the finish is ETERNAL, with a banana aftertaste (typical of bourbons) and there is always a dim sherry note coming and going on the nose and palate. After two sips you get the hang of it and learn how to taste it without dying because of its power. It is not a punch in the face, its like Mike Tyson's punch in the face, and for me, that is not too appealing. I am not a big fan of cask strenght whiskies because of that. If it is not enjoyable easily, why even bother. This super complex dram is maybe too powerful for me, but i recognize that it is a work of art. 

Overall i give this baby a 97 over 100, and i know most experienced whisky lovers will give it a 100 without doubt. Cheers."
