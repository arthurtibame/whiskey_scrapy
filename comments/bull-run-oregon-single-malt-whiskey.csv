3.0,"I like the malt, but there are some odd (for me) herbal notes. Not sure if that is from the yeast or what exactly.  Batch 1, bottle 3462. Will need to try another batch."
3.5,"Light, grainy, a little hot but tasty"
4.0,"Tart cherry nose with a little of that reedy young wood varnish sass on the palate, which I like. Sweet vanilla finish with some lingering savor. Viva Cascadia!"
5.0,"Notes of pear and apple, rich herbaceous body with a dry complex tea-like finish."
4.5,The 5 year is a great example of Oregon Single Malt. Very smooth with great texture.
