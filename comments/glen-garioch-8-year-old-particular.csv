4.25,"This single malt, single cask, non color added, non chill-filtered whiskey is bottled at cask strength from a refill hogshead. Only 290 bottles were filled. If you were fortunate enough to get one, you know what a gem you found.
I personally needed a lot of water to tame the cask strength and young heat, but what incredible scents and flovors in an 8 yo whiskey. Smokey, malty, peaty, seashore, sweet and savory on the nose. Thick, coating palate with buttery cream, vanilla custard, and sweet tea. Sweet and spicy medium finish."
4.25,"Impressions, shoulder-level: 

Fresh into the glass, the nose resembles a Riesling, a cloying sweetness followed by the funk of decayed roses.  

Without water, the palate is spicy but not overwhelmingly hot.  The flavors largely mirror the nose, though the sweetness is restrained enough to keep the flavors in balance.  Sugar glazed confections, elderflower syrup, and green bell peppers all make appearances.  The proof provides for a finish that’s long and dry.

Finding the correct dilution for this whisky is a challenge, but the sweet spot is full of fruit, wood spice, and sulphuric funk.  This was a great find at $37, and a good example of  a young, spirit driven whisky."
