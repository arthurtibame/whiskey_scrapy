4.0,"This is a fun little sip. It's got considerable snap and crackle from the young whiskey in the blend, no mistake, but the older additions rein things in just in time. Feels like you can identify all three players in the band - almost by order of age - but they come together surprisingly tunefully.

I got chocolates on the nose, sweet wood, and maybe even a hint of buttercream. On the lips, after the moonshine fire, the tastes follow suit while adding a bit of cherry and toast. Nice medium finish. Reminds me overall of some high-corn Four Roses variations I've had, but with a unique high octane kick.

I got this on sale for $30 which feels like a steal. Would pay reg price of ~$40ish and be much happier with it than, say, Whippersnapper."

3.0,"Price: $33.99 at Target in Orange County, California.

Setting: Neat in a tumbler with my dad.

Nose: Brown sugar and oak. Quite a bit more difficult to parse out individual aromas without my trusty Glencairn. (16/25 points)

Taste: Oak, corn, peanuts, cinnamon. Kind of tastes like a better made Jack Daniels. (40/50 points)

Finish: Medium-short. Caramel apple with a little heat. (16/25) points)

Conclusion: I really wanted to like this, as I think High West produces some excellent whiskies and I really appreciate their openness about sources, blends, etc. Unfortunately, I just don’t think it’s that good – it tastes like a young, mass-produced bourbon. If the price were right, that wouldn’t necessarily be a problem, but for almost $34 a bottle, you’re competing against heavyweights like Four Roses Single Barrel, and it isn’t much of a competition. At least the bottle looks cool.

3.75,"I am a huge fan of High West and especially their limited release store picks. In this case we have the following:
Costco Store pick finished in ex Rum Casks for an additional 1yr and 6 months. It clock's in at 51.9% abv. Cost is $39.99.
This is the 4th store pick I have tried and have really enjoyed them all. They are so unique and an amazing value. For reference, the base juice is a blend of 2-13 yr MGP high rye Bourbon at 46% abv. It retails at $39.99. So for no extra $ (typically it's a $10-20 mark up) I am getting more proof and extended finishing! I am sold! On to the tasting.
On the nose you get a lovely blend of rye, clove and mollasas. This tells me to expect a pronounced Rum influence. On the pallette, it starts with the rye and clove notes. They threaten to swell but move very quickly to burnt brown sugar, tobacco and a hint of oak. Then comes the big finish with features a big mollasas and pappaya note. It lingers and tastes like sugar cane residue on my pallette. As expected, the rum cask comes thru big on the finish. Lovely but it is sweet. Really smooth for the proof. No heat whatsoever and a mild hug.  
Herein lies some of the rub. This reminds me a lot of the Angels Envy Rye (I would argue this has better balance and is half the cost) and I would say while I really enjoy it, 1 pour is enough per sitting. A great apperitif but not a regular drinker. 
For that reason I will take a 1/4 point off. Still very unique and good, but too sweet to be in regular rotation for my pallette. If you are a Rum drinker or enjoy Bourbon's on the sweeter side, seek this out!"

This is the only cheap offering of High West in North Carolina, and at $40 it isn't exactly cheap. Everything else is $75-100, which is prohibitively expensive for bourbon in most cases. To me this is a one-note bourbon that is matched by many in the $20-30 range. I get more alcohol burn on the nose than I would expect and mainly taste spicy cherry wood with an alcohol finish. Personally I would suggest passing on buying a full bottle of this and try to taste it first, there are so many in this price range I think are superior."

I’m a fan of High West, but this one seems, well, lacking.  Overly sweet, candy corn and mild wet oak.  With a hot long finish.  Was this meant to be had neat, or in cocktails?  It’s just lacking in character which makes me think cocktail.  For a HW pedigree, my bar was set higher.  One sip would’ve suffice,  but at $15, I’m compelled to nurse this for as long as I can.

3.0,"NOTE: The blend has changed since the Distiller notes were written. Per High West's website, the MGP 75/21/4 is still listed, but the other bourbon that they list is 84/8/8 which would make it Dickel sourced. They do not divulge the source of the other components due to ""contractual obligations"". I doubt there is any more 13yo bourbon finding its way in here or it seems they would definitely push that. As a side-note, I appreciate the way that they are as open about their sourcing as they can be.

Batch 18019
Nose: Old oak, hay, saddle soap and leather, varnish, some orange peel and just a hint of dill in the background. High West always delivers (for me anyway) on the nose. This is a very interesting combination of notes, but I'm not sure that the combination bodes well for the palate. 

Neat: Enters with a light honey sweetness followed by rye spice, black pepper and oak. Not overly complex. Bitter drying finish, similar to orange/lemon pith. Limited burn with tingly oak lingering on the palate. Some time in the glass either brings out a little more sweetness, or you palate adjusts and finds more there. I'm not sure which.  

Splash: A few drops of water really brings the orange peel to the forefront of the nose. Gives the palate a pink bubble gummy sweetness. Tones down the drying astringency on the finish and makes it more pure orange/citrus and less citrus pith. A few drops of water increased my enjoyment of this one immensely and save it from a score in the 2's. 

Verdict: I'm glad I tried it, but I don't see this being a repeat buy at $40. A bar local to me has ordered in a barrel of this finished in peated scotch casks (the only barrel select available in the entire state). I definitely want to give that a shot, though. I love High West's experimentations, but this on its own was just okay for me."
3.5,"Barrel Select, barrel no. 6109, bottle no. 170, 51.2% abv, Total Wine & More, finish time 1 year 7 months in a rye barrel. Light nose, very sweet and a dill note. On the palate, balanced with sweet and spicy notes. Some cedar. Ends with cacao nibs. Very pleasant. 11/25/18"

3.75,"So far I really like this bourbon. I just opened the bottle yesterday so I’ll wait to give a full review, so it has the chance to breathe. High West is doing good things with this and Double Rye. Then they go completely stupid with prices of their other offerings."

2.25,"High West, yet another western state startup using eastern state sourced juice.  Ok this isn't a completely bad idea, Tin Cup, Stranahans etc are doing some good work with this model as well.  Not gonna lie to you though, I don't think much of millionaires who want to get their name up in lights by starting their own craft distillery/vineyards in some hoity toity tourist ski town, to me this is just a sign of  exuberant arrogance and hubris.  As a purist, give me a trusted (East of the Mississip) century plus year old name label any day over these johnny come lately wannabes, but they are becoming too common place to ignore, so here goes.

Batch: 18A3(D or 0)  Pint

Nose: The young mgp high rye spice is evident here as the spice jumps up first,  caramel corn sugars arrive but also some nice, very sweet dark plum and apricot notes, something I would not have expected at all.  The aged Kentucky juice is clearly giving this a nice boost.  This is a really promising nose.

Front:  Hot, sweet start, the young mgp is again the more prominent and easily notable element with a prevalent rye factor.  A few hints of average sweet bourbon notes, vanilla and toffee are barely detectable.  

Finish:  It ends as fast as it started with no real change to the profile, for a 90 proofer this seems entirely thin in the middle.  It's not bad it just never really develops beyond the nice nose, as it's simply too watered down with the young Indiana juice.  This comes off much more as an American whiskey than a bourbon,  even with some well aged Kentucky juice blended in. 

Like David Perkins, I too have been to Loretto  Kentucky and seen the beauty and grace of a perfected craft, this does not, however make me a master Distiller,  and I too, given the bank roll could import a large amount of Fred Noe, Chris Morris or Eddie Russells well aged juice and blend something pretty acceptable out of it.  I'd like to say this is better than it is, if only to recommend the work of MGP and other venerable distilleries.  Maybe I will grab a bottle of Dickel BiB and Old Forester Rye and concoct a blend that can match or beat this for equal or less money.   High West's American Prairie isn't a bad effort but being just ok isn't exceptional.  I'm fairly certain I could do just as well on my own blending bourbons.

If you're skiing in the Rockies and find yourself in a nice resort bar by all means sample some ""local"" product, but when you want the real thing, skip these gimmicky marketing labels and remember where ""the juice"" really comes from, you'll be glad you did."

3.5,"Wow tasty. It seems like you can separate and taste each whiskey they use in the blend. On the nose is the youngest, a strong alcohol and sweet oak.  Then on the palate is the middle aged, and on the finish the mellowness and oak of the 13 year. 
I agree it is nice and complex, just a little hot on the nose and the finish.  But really quite nice for a entry level product. I look forward to trying their other offerings.  

Strong caramel, corn, and vanilla on the tongue. A little fruity nature also.  A little spice and heat on the swallow leading in to a pleasant oak and sweet finish.  A little of a strong and almost 'cheap vodka' type finish takes away from the rest of the wonderful experience.  While I don't like paying almost $30 for sourced juice, this is a nice little dram.  Compares reasonably well to Knob creek in terms of complexity and profile, with a little less fruit. Right on the edge of something I would buy again, but it is from a good brand that does things right so why not."

4.5,"Wonderful bourbon. Easily one of my top 5 bourbons to this date (i dont have that many). I believe it is 46%, and it was very enjoyable. 

On the nose it starts like any bourbon but then adds great layers of aromas. Banana, Prunes, Bronzer, A little salty, Vanilla ice cream, Caramel used in ""flan"" (caramel creme) and also a back Floral note. Complex.

On the palate is where it gets more surprising: it starts SOOOO SWEET: Sugary notes, honey/toffee for a long moment then a pleasant spice in the palate. There is an ashy note somewhere too.

Finish is very long, Herbal presence is strong. Very fresh and clean finish with clove. long and tasty.

Overall this was a great dram that deserves at least a 92 over 100. Cheers"

Barrel spices, apple, vanilla, leather, ash, and sandalwood on the palate. Not a lot in the mid-palate at all, rushes right to the finish. 

Finish blasts with a prickly ethanol heat that obscures all other flavors for a second or two before settling into a nutty and chocolatey after finish. That after finish is by far the best part of this bourbon, and is decently long. Mouthfeel is oily and matches the flavor profile well. 

Sharp and biting, but there are some decent flavors In here. I wanted to like this more than I actually did, but ultimately the young component to this blend rears it’s head a little too prominently. At $36, the price is right and you get what you pay for but certainly nothing more."
