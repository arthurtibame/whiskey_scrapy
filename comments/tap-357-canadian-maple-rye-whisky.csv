4.0,"it's very potent... I prefer to drink it on the rocks (3 precisely). Great overtones of the 3-5-7 year mix small batch. Once it hits your pallet it's sharp has a little bite and a kick at first but when it rolls back the maple kicks in. After your second sip, it still has a punch but goes down decent. It's a nice product... hands down its superior compared to a kentucky whiskey like jim beam maple or even a flavored Crown Royal.  Give it a go, you won't be disappointed. Cheers!"

1.0,"Very light nose,followed by light mouthfeel and then a light finish that is reminisent of licking a fork that barely has any maple syrup on it. I don't see the point of this."

2.0,Also tried it at Disney. Too sweet. Crown Maple is much better if you like that flavor. Basically drinking thin maple syrup. Goes down smooth though.
