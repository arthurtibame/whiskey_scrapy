2.0,Standard almonds and vanilla in the nose.  Harsh alcohol taste dominating the pallet.  Sweet honey and brown sugar underneath.

3.25,Aged in 2nd hand wine barrels.  This makes for an interesting flavor profile that isn't like most whiskeys.
3.5,"Nose of sugar, flowers and grass, sweet opener, oak, caramel rest of the way"

2.5,Young. Alcohol. One dimensional: burnt corn/ leather. Thought it would be a “unique” variant of bourbon but kinda too underwhelming. Don’t taste the wine barreling at all
