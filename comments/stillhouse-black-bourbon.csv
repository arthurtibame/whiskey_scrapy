3.0,Can’t really taste the coffee hint. Lingering warmth. Good mixer if you’re not worried.

3.5,"Interesting packaging first of all to say the least, comes off as a can of turpentine to the untrained eye.

Not a coffee drinker myself but you can without a doubt get the hints of tue coffee bean finish to this one. Great concept & one to keep an eye out for; this along with their other flavored whiskeys; Gluten-Free if I remember correctly. Cheers!!"

3.75,"Great marketing with the canteen look...badass appeal! The bourbon is middle of the road, though. The coffee seems to be mostly a marketing thing also, as there’s only a small, sweet coffee note at the finish. At the end of the day, I definitely enjoyed it!m"

2.5,"The bottle is incredible. The folks around you will think you are pouring gas or paint thinner. Love the packaging. This has a a creamy tasty, quick sharp bite, and short warmth to finish. It is not the most flavorful spirit but does have quite the attractive packaging. Fun to have on the shelf. Less fun to drink."
3.5,"I think this one punches way above its weight.  My wife picked this up and I was like - seriously?  Out of a can?  But I guess its a lesson that good bourbons can come from anywhere & I like this one.  I get the strong coffee taste, mixed with vanilla.  The finish is smooth & a little mild - but I get a nice transition to black liquorice/anise.  I enjoy it for the money and would buy it again."
