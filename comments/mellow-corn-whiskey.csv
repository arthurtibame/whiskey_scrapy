4.0,"Fantastic Reference Whiskey. 
Hard to mistake the influence of corn on a mashbill after trying this one. At four years of age and 100 proof, it represents good value. Braver souls might play with blending this and other spirits. Palate is buttery sweet corn. The corn here is some of the cleanest I've experienced in a Whiskey, I guess when less is going on in the juice, they can really optimize the quality. Nothing but the ideal corn note, but sometimes that's all you want."

4.0,"Surprised how much I like this, especially since I've largely given up bourbon for scotch. The heavy corn gives this a sweetness and creaminess that balances the sharp oak notes that dominate some bourbons.  Great buttery, even peanut butter taste. And for $11 I can drink as much as I want!."

2.0,"The green and yellow bottle immediately brought to mind the Green Bay Packers. On nosing, Elmer's glue and banana are dominant, however, not very strong.  Black pepper, oak and creamy butter make their way onto the palate.  Finishes with hints of corn and oak.  This is a bit unique and slightly funky.  Not as bold as the Packers. More like a college frat house football team: not exciting stuff but definitely cheap ($13). [78/100][Tasted: 8/12/15]"

2.0,"Purchased for $13 at a big box liquor store. Color is pretty thin and yellow. Nutty aroma with some popcorn. Flavor is corn heavy, as you'd expect. Pretty thin mouthfeel and not much in the finish beyond the alcohol. Seems to get sickly sweet when mixed with cola. Not a bad price for a bonded whiskey, but certainly not a daily sipper."

1.0,"I was driving through Kentucky and I purposely stopped just to grab a bottle of this. I so very much was looking forward to trying it out. I was really happy to find out it was $10. 

...And then I tried it. 

I did not like it at all. It was nothing but hot and spicy. I've had unaged corn whiskey before (Dawsonville Moonshine) before and I can definitely tell similarities in the taste.  That's not really a good thing to me. If it was aged for 4 years then the color and taste don't indicate it. It tastes anything but ""mellow"" to me. I may have to downgrade this to a mixer bottle. I won't be searching for another bottle."
3.0,Fun whiskey to take your tastes to a different place uncomplicated but mellow with a hot memorable finish. Not everyone will enjoy but it is worth a try and cheap if you can find it.
3.5,"Salted butter and peanut brittle on the nose. Hot hot hot on the palate, sweet corn and roasted peanuts, with a long, warm hug going down. The finish lasts and lasts, with a hint of the darkest cacao. Will need to try this with a splash or ice cube of limestone water, but this is sippable straight. Not too complex and can be slightly harsh, but the flavors are strong and good. And I can't fail to mention the fantastic price point. 4/8/17
Tried it with a limestone water ice cube, muted it a little bit but didn't change the flavor profile. Just sip it neat and take it full force, rough edges and all. 4/9/17"

Thin, doesn't have the robust and rich feel of the Balcones. Better with a bit of water to tone the heat down.

2.0,"It's hard to be mad at an $11 bottle of whiskey for not being complex. It's not bad - it's just that the word Mellow should be replaced with Dusty. Drinking this is like the flavor equivalent of inhaling ground up corn- and sawdust. Mix 4 parts Mellow Corn and one part Talisker Storm and you've got something interesting, though, so there's that. I guess."
3.0,"Nose - Corn syrup, lightly buttered corn grits, light vanilla simple.

Taste - Sweet creamy buttered corn grits, light white pepper spice/heat, vanilla simple, light cinnamon.

Finish - Lingering corn syrup vanilla sweet, cinnamon heat.

Score - 75/100

Final Thoughts - Pretty clean and straightforward nose. No off putting or offensive notes. Amazingly not as strong ""corn"" notes as I would've expected because it has a more ""mellow corn"" flavor throughout. Not the most interesting one, but not bad by any means. I'm not sure how I'd drink this as it's not the most interesting neat, and the flavor doesn't exactly lend itself to a great cocktail. I wouldn't turn down a pour of this, but it's not exactly something I'd specifically order either."

1.5,"Finally decided to try this one. I began taking my notes as I do for every new spirit I try and realized no one wanted my in depth review of this (unless they are interested in reading the word ""corn"" 50 times in a two paragraph review). Now don't get me wrong, I am grateful to Hipsters for contributing several things to society; that great smelling organic handmade soap I use, avocados are delicious, I've always been a coffee snob, and I don't mind a PBR on occasion. One thing I am not grateful for is this stuff. In a word, rotgut. What I imagine whiskey flavored vodka would taste like if they picked said vodka from the bottomest of bottom shelves. Now, if you'll excuse me I'm going to try googling ""Mellow Corn cocktails"". Maybe I can find something to make it palatable."

Body- Astringent with some creamy caramel. Tastes younger than it is due to the high corn content.

2.75,"Purchased at a Maryland Liquor store that was preying on the ignorant and/or desperate, selling anything remotely rare for over 10x retail.  Stagg Jr. for $599.99.  Weller Special Reserve 750ml bottles for $399.99!!  So egregious, I feel compelled to call them out with specificity: Tri State Liquors 96 Souder Rd, Brunswick, MD 21716  (301) 834-4448.  

The Mellow Corn was slightly overpriced at $16.99, but not terribly so, and I had never seen it in a store before, and had heard generally good things.  So I swallowed the pill and gave these jerks my cash.  I do hate myself a bit, on principle.

750ml pour neat into Glencairn at home.  Nose is definitely corn, as to be expected, with a little heat and dry grass.  Fairly mild.  Taste has more corn, definite heat, with the grass from the nose now watered.  Not exactly mellow, but certainly drinkable.  This is a one-note affair, but interesting and cheap enough to put on the home shelf.  9/7/19."

The palate is sweet with corn and nice leather and some oak with a few baking spices.

The finish is on the shorter side of medium. 

Alright, this one is great. I can’t believe for $16 you get a bottled in bond (at least 4yrs old) whiskey that is actually good for sipping."

2.25,"This whiskey is aged in a used, charred barrel to mimic how bourbon got started. Moonshiners discovered that charring the inside of the barrel brought the sugars in the wood to the inside edge of the barrel.  It would take 9 months to go down from Kentucky to new orleans.  Through that trip, they discovered that a little bit of aging aided the whiskey a lot :)

Nose: buttered, sweet corn. Similar to a kettle corn. Alcohol is also very present on the nose.  

Taste: fiery, slightly sweet. No tannins, really.  This is because it's in a used, charred barrel. Pretty thin, not very viscous. 

Finish: mostly picked up corn and alcohol."

All told, not a bad whisky by any means, just not a really good one. I like the lighter profile, but want more character; I hear there are some corn whiskies out there now with heirloom variety corns, and will have to seek them out. But for one looking to understand American whisky in general, this is a fundamental cornerstone whisky worth trying at least once."

2.0,"Before it became vogue to buy the bottom shelf and suffer through its indignity in the name of being cool, this was relegated to sad corners of the world where people clamored for that ol country mountain dew. It hasn't changed much for the better. 

Despite it's 4 year age, you'd be hard pressed to find any maturity here which is a tribute to the deficiencies in production. This simply isn't a well crafted spirit -- a real shame because being rough as a prison yard shiv shouldn't be a goal after 4 years. 

Initially, edgy sweetness, slightly rusty razor blade texture going down, with some kettle corn yum buried in the brutal throat punch it packs. It could, it should, be better. It starts with inputs and this is lacking. Sells for between $18-$24, but should be priced around $12-15 for what you're getting."

3.0,"This is a follow-up to my earlier taste.  I've used Mellow Corn in quite a few interesting cocktails, from a highball to a curious negroni cousin using ambrato vermouth.  Try it in a recipe where you'd normally use a vodka or gin and you might be surprised.  This does need a bit more love from that side of the aisle, but right now I want to concentrate on this neat.

This is a subtle whiskey.  It's light and bright and sweet and creamy.  The mouthfeel isn't thick or oily, but it's rich none the less.  There's a very nice corn sweetness that delights the taste buds when the mood calls for a treat. This is the cocktail equivalent of a bonbon.

The proof is evinced by a bit of heat, a blush of white pepper, and the most tentative of Kentucky hugs.  Mellow Corn is a light sipper.

I'm not a big fan of buttered popcorn, but my wife is.  With social distancing a dominant part of our world, we spend more than a few evenings binging old movies or new series.  When she opts for the popcorn, I'll be having my own version - a bottled in bond liquid corn version.  

On my scale of 1 to 5, an average, well-produced product will score a 2.5. The bell curve should see most reviews landing between 2.0 and 3.0.  Mellow Corn is running with the pack, maybe with a nose on the downward-sloping curve and at a value price point.  That's a win."
