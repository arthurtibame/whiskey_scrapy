3.25,"Nose - (w./o water) Light peat/smoke, sweet savory smoked meat, chocolate, light brine, chili pepper spice, similar to a chocolate mole smoked ham (w/ water) Reduced peat/smoke, sweet soy sauce, salted sweet jerky, cocoa powder

Taste - (w/o water) Bit dry, hot chili/pepper spice/tingle, light smoke, toasted/roasted barley, chocolate, sweet chili pepper turkey jerky, reduced teriyaki sauce (w/ water) still dry, reduced chili taste, sweet smoked jerky, more roasted/toasted barley, soy sauce chocolate

Finish - (w/o water) toasted sweet chili tingle, sweet smoked meat, weird metallic sweet, chocolate, burnt sugar sweet (w/ water) lasting chili tingle, light metallic sweet jerky, toasted barley

Score - 75/100

Final Thoughts - I think I'm just not a fan of Westland's stuff. Their spirit is on the younger side & it shows (most are less than 4-5 years old) in the lack of depth. The raw toasted barley shows through and maybe I'm not a huge fan of that? The garry oak adds this salty sweet jerky note that I guess I'm not a huge fan of. I can see how people might like this, but it's definitely not for me.

Would I drink it if offered? - No

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

3.75,"I rounded out my recent Chicago swing with a trip to Delilah's.  Delilah's is a classic dive bar in Lincoln Park that caters to all types - guys hunched over a beer at the bar, 20-somethings crowded around tables doing shots, and whiskey aficianados taking careful sips between consultations with the bartenders.  All with a soundtrack on late seventies post-punk in the background.

The whiskeys, of which there are currently about 800, are Delilah's claim to fame, and includes quite a few rarities, barrel picks and bespoke editions.  

The selection process was therefore challenging, but I chose to start with the Westland Garryana.  I had yet to see it in the wild, and jumped at the chance.

I found primarily malt and grain on the nose.  The palate had the same, along with a sweet coffee note (distinctly coffee for me and not chocolate), and wood. There's also some spice that's a bit hard to place, along with some dryness, particularly on the finish.  I assume that the spice note and perhaps the dryness is from the Garry oak.  Maybe I'd feel differently if I was more acclimated to Garry oak, but I found it to be a bit sharp, although not harsh. Admittedly, I feel the same way about Mizunara oak.

Overall, I liked the Garryana but did not love it.  It's smooth and the coffee note is different and very enjoyable.  On the other hand, it lacked a certain boldness, and I'm not sold on the Garryana wood.  There's some exciting stuff going on in the American single malt market, and in the end, I was hoping for a bit more."

4.5,Really enjoyed the pour of this that I had the other night. More subtle peat than I was expecting (looking at your Ardbeg). A great example of single malts done in the US - keep hitting it out of the park Westland!
