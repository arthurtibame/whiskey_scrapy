4.0,"I disagree with Stephanie, The Collingwood is anything but bitter, quite the contrary. It is smooth and rather nicely sweet with the subtlest maple wood overtones. Not maple syrup by any stretch and easily an enjoyable whiskey on its own. Good stuff."

3.0,"Nicely drinkable. A very different type of sweetness than I am used to in a whiskey. While I wouldn't go so far as to compare the nose to a marker (as distiller does), I do find that the aroma grows sweeter as you are drinking it. Perfectly fine for sipping...no cola needed."
2.0,This is very drinkable but nothing unique. Good value for the price.

2.0,"Obvious aromas of vanilla, wood shavings and butterscotch pudding. The taste is light and mellow, with smooth maplewood and spicy rye grain flavours. A very simple, sweetish whiskey."

4.0,Smooth and a little sweet with a splash of water. I was pleasantly surprised by this whisky. I would definitely go out of my way to get this again...oh and it's also very reasonably priced.

3.0,"Nose- heavy caramel, vanilla and wood spice.  Similar to crown royal but maybe slightly more intense.
Taste- Toffee with hints of black pepper and oak.  Mild alcohol burn.  Rather smooth.
Finish- spicy on the finish with more of the peppery notes coming to the top.  More vanilla, toffee.

Overall- not a bad sipping whisky at all to be honest.  Really similar to crown royal and at a comparable cost.  For everyday sipping when you want to spare the more expensive stuff it will do just fine.  I would buy it again."
3.0,"Good Canadian whisky that clearly shows its been aged in former Jack Daniels casks. The nose is quite tropical, with strong notes of bananas. The palate is sweet and light, with a finish that is... unpredictable. Is it the maple wood used to enhance its flavor? I'm not sure, but it does make for something different and original."

2.0,"Smooth, very sweet caramelized toffee, raw oak and just a hint of rye spice. Sort of like a cross between Gibson' Finest and Wiser's Legacy with melted toffee mixed in. Good underlying flavour but much too sweet for my taste. Makes a good sour. $35 in Ontario."

On the tongue, and the finish, Sugar crusted wood. Lightly toasted bread."

3.25,"Canada has a growing amount of what I like to think of as ""dessert"" whiskies. Not because they are cloying sweet, but because they have treat-like notes and they're far to easy to enjoy (and likely overindulge on). Luckily, this one won't increase your waistline too quickly!

Collingwood Toasted Maplewood Stave Finished blended whisky has a polite Canadian maple syrup nose with a smooth wood, spice and vanilla flavour. Straightforward short finish, which makes it easy to drink quickly. Flexible for cocktails and refreshing with ice. I also admire their unique and elegant bottle. 7/10."

2.75,"My high scores streak is over. A very un-enjoyable whisky, not the kind of sweet you hope in a dram. a cinnamon shot is not something pleasant for me.

Bottled at 40%abv, with a russetmuscat color.

On the nose is sweet but and not that bad but it is an omen of what you are going to get on the palate. Nosing notes i found: strong alcohol note for a 40%abv. Liquorice, brown sugar, toffee and cinnamon. 

On the palate is just lame. Liquorice, Cinnamon, Mild spicyness, Pine or some herb, Not pleasant at all seems like those whisky fire editions (like jack daniel's fire), Young oak. 

Finish is short and way too sweet to be good, so it is bad.

Overall i give this a very generous 59 over a 100 and i really think of this as a 2.5 over 5, but my scoring system tells me 2.9. Not recommended at all."
