4.0,"Dec 9, 2018 at Grain Tasting Bar in Vancouver. 
Served in a tasting glass as a flight 1 of 4, .75 ounce each.
Light in color. Good legs on glass. A very enticing nose for what amounts to a 3 year old whisky. Vanilla, oak, hint of cocoa, maybe a trace of smoke. Smooth on the palate. Not quite as interesting on the nose as the Collingwood next to it. 
A nice whisky with natural or near natural color, and it is a single malt, but may be overpriced at $60.

And again July 13th 2019 at Central City pub. Yum!"

4.0,"I get a very distinctive honey dew melon note from the nose. Taste is more of a mellow juicy honey flavour. Very sweet throughout but not unenjoyable. Finish is very short and bright, crisp like a dry white wine."

3.75,"Fresh, youthful but rich dram. The nose is crisp fruit, lemon and cooked butter. The palate coats nicely, but is sharp and has a fair amount of ethanol. Still, it has some spice, honeyed lemon, graham cracker and more fried butter. The finish is short, drying with a bit of oak. I find it hard to rate this. The flavours are excellent,  but it is hampered by its youth."

3.75,"Lots of apple juice, and light flowers on the nose. Palate is buttery and earthy, with malty sweetness, and a finish with just a tiny bit of barrel spice and more vegetal earthiness. Noticeably young, but really quite tasty!"
4.0,"Fruity, light and taste of green pears. Easy fading finish."
3.5,"Pungent pear on the nose among other fruits, immediate light spice, finish is incredibly refreshing and provides more citrusy fruits. Really really good."
