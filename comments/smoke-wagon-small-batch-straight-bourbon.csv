3.5,"Definitely get the rye, and vanilla. Burns a little indicating it's young given the high rye. Overall not too shabby. Gonna let it sit and revisit."

4.25,Pretty darn good for a $55 bottle of high rye at 100 proof. Tastes purty darn good!

5.0,"High rye mash bill and a blend of 4 year, 6 year, and 11 year old bourbons. Intense rye spice at the start and rich caramel at the finish. The uncut/unfiltered version is even better"

5.0,High rye bourbon. Great rye spices with big caramel flavors. Finish is complex and long lasting. My favorite bourbon right now. Great with a cube of ice and opens up really nicely. Pairs really well with a full bodied cigar.
