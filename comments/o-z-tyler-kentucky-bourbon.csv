3.25,Yes it’s young and yes it tastes young but it is also very smooth. The fact that it is young doesn’t necessarily mean it is bad. You get a lot of more the raw sweet corn flavor and is just a different profile than most bourbons. It takes me back to visiting the distilleries and trying all the “white whiskey” at each one every time I sip on this. Not to mention it is a very cost effective option to have! They know and describe that this is young when you visit them but it is their unique process that enables them to have such a smooth young whiskey. You have to expect that flavor profile to be able to properly enjoy and appreciate this.

2.75,"Nose: Young.  Malt, grass, cinnamon.
Palate: White pepper, tobacco, lemon

Only aged 1yr and 1 day, but filtered with a new TerrePure process.  Almost has more Speyside Scotch notes than Bourbon, but is hot and a bit headsy at 90pf."
