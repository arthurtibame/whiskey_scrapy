3.75,"Nose - fruity, salty, a lot of alcohol, and there's a hell of a lot of really in your face oak. This is very on the citrus side with some perhaps sugar cookie notes. 

Taste - creamy, vanilla, oak, salt, citrus.  Intense huge even. The body is mouth coating. Water really brings out the sweetness, almost a completely change in the sweet tones. Now I""m getting more baked goods.

This is a perfect example of the new make from springbank with a lot of time in a very tired oak barrel. The overall effect is that of a really great sipping dram. I can't speak highly enough of this for those who don't want wine cask influence. It is a bit sour and the oak levels are a bit high.

An extremely complex whisky for those who can appreciate a hell of a lot of elements that I believe are acquired tastes."
