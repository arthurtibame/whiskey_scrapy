4.0,Fruity and floral at first and then lifts off into a shortbread malty taste.
5.0,This first taste hits you with a floral and citrus note hard. To me there’s no hidden flavor it’s Jameson but exactly what you would want if you love hops. The bitter aftertaste is exactly like drinking a fresh ipa. It is super smooth no sharp bite or acetone smell.

2.0,"Saccharine caramel and honey vanilla on the nose, almost candy. Nuts mingle with some bitterness (more from the grain than the hops), and then the sweet honeyed character pokes through.

4.0,"Surprised by this one. I'll start by saying that I am not an IPA fan. Too much bitter grapefruit for me, but this delivers that note in just the right amount. Nose is hoppy grain/malt, buttered fresh bread, apple/pear, and hints of citrus. Neat it starts light and sweet with vanilla, cereal grain, citrus, and just a hint of milk chocolate. The finish is where you get the hoppy drying grapefruity  bitter note of an IPA but, for me anyway, in just the right amount. Definitely not overpowering. Absolutely no burn. A splash doesn't change much, simply adding a bit more of the chocolate note and slightly muting the finish. I can see how a hophead might be disappointed in this one, but I really enjoyed it. This also makes me wonder if maybe I was mistaken in hooking my  Irish Whiskey Wagon to the Bushmill train. I might have to explore the Jameson line."

4.0,"First whiff was regular Jameson. Then the nose led to (in order) lemon, sour green apple, juniper, herbal notes, and floral notes - maybe even lavender. After a sip the nose included peach, hops, green menthol, malted milk balls, lime and bergamot. Last to show up on the nose was something that reminded me of a mellow American pale ale.

The palate was easy-drinking. Sweet and honeyed. Lemon juice, eucalyptus, butter in both taste and feel. Malted barley, ginger, caramel, and key lime pie.

The finish was medium length with menthol, bitterness, flowers, vanilla creme, spearmint and cinnamon (think hot tamales candy). 

Overall this didn’t knock my socks off, but was very interesting. Almost like a sweeter Irish whiskey up front with the finish of an herbal rye."

The hop presence did not blow my face out (like most piss-poorly crafted IPAs) and left enough of the Jameson notes for you to appreciate this offering.  It fairs really well on my price point vs. complexity scale as it is very reasonable at ~$23.99/750ml.  I am also a huge fan of well balanced American, Double, and Traditional (British) IPAs.

1.0,"I am not a fan of Original Jameson; just don’t care for that pot still unmalted barley taste, but I figured I’d give this a try because I like IPAs, especially the more floral English style. Alas, this whiskey was a higher disappointment. Not only did it have that coppery Irish pot still taste, but it was also bitter, alcoholic, and tasted of overused casks and underage grain whiskey. The aroma started off with promise; less pot still smell; more depth, more sweetness, even a hint of esters. But the palate began with a pretty dry and very Irish tasting arrival, some sugar, some vanilla, but obvious alcohol and youth. The end of the swallow got sweeter, and the finish had some lingering vanilla and Irish pot still flavor, but it was mild, tainted with alcohol and oak tannins, and mercifully short. I don’t like regular Jameson, but I’m doing this as a side by side and the regular is so much better. Sweeter, peppier, and even though I don’t like the Irish taste, it is more distinctive and comes through on the original. Blech. Wish I had left this on the shelf."

2.5,"Much more complex, compared to the standard Jameson. Still not a great whiskey, but interesting. Don't taste IPA notes specifically, just a deeper, richer flavor than the standard. 

Worth the $5 premium for sure over the standard, but still not a great value in Irish whiskey. Take something like the Bushmills Black Bush or Teelings Small Batch -- both are far better for a similar price."

1.0,"Well, what a difference a cask makes!  Just as the Stout edition was an overall positive experience and enhanced profile for the standard Jameson flavor, the IPA seems to be almost the exact opposite.  Perhaps the IPA is the ""Scotch drinkers"" choice whereas the Stout is a drink for Bourboners but there is little that stands out other than the pale ale bitterness with this variant.   

As one taster noted a harsh bitter IPA leftover tone and little else, makes this not what I look for in these enhanced finishing designs, much bitterness with not even citrus notes as a distraction.  I could go on but would only be repeating what an extremely bitter whiskey this is with no real redeeming quality added through the extra finishing stage.  For the Pink Gin or Manhattan lover this might be the way to go, give it a try and see what you think.  An Old Fashioned with no sugar was never my thing.

Dryer than the Sahara and the Dust Bowl combined, for those who find bourbon far too sweet this may be the way to go.  I'd much rather have a plain Jamesons over the IPA edition, and that really is all you should need to know."

I was very wrong and kind of feel misled a bit. There’s a DIFFERENCE between the Caskmates version and regular ol’ Jameson, but it’s very difficult to get any hops out of the stuff. It’s essentially a slightly more spicy, sharper Jameson. If you like Jameson, you’re not going to be disappointed. If you’re like me, I don’t think you’ll be finding something new from this style."

2.5,"I am fairly new to Irish whiskey with Redbreast and the standard Jameson the extent of my experience. Whilst at a Tap house with a very limited Whiskey selection, it was between this one and the Stout edition. I prefer an IPA over a stout so I went for this one! 
Honestly, I really got no IPA influence at all. From a taste standpoint it was pretty similar to the standard offering with more amplified sweet notes (toffee, honey and apple). It's a short finish with only some toasted grain notes to add. 
It's not bad by any stretch, and I enjoyed the pour enough, it just really didn't do anything for me beyond it not being unpleasant!
A quick search in my Market shows this goes for around $30. At that price, this is a hard pass for me. For a $7 pour, you could do worse. 
Cheers all!"
3.75,"Color: very similar to standard Jameson slightly darker.

Nose: light with fruit and another I can’t quite place.

        Palate: A creamy arrival of bittersweet barley, dried fruit and brown sugar-water. The development starts to turn a little sour and verges towards the metallic. You sense the IPA note more on the palate than the nose.
        
        Finish: Short. A slightly hard malty and fruit note that fades quickly leaving a faint sour hoppy tang.
        
        I don't get a particularly strong IPA note to the nose of this, but there is that elusive aroma of elderflowers that happens with ale-cask maturation, or whisky made from a hopped wash. In the mid-palate and right at the end of the finish as everything else is fading away are when you most taste the hops.
        
        Like its stablemate the Stout Cask finish, this is essentially Jameson's standard turned up by one notch, but with a slightly different finishing profile. This one is floral and hoppy whereas the stout cask is dark fruity/chocolate and cream, but the profile is stronger and more defined in this whisky.
        
        It's pleasant and if the ordinary Jameson's was more like either of these caskmates editions I wouldn't be displeased.  Nothing much to write home about really, but perfectly drinkable and worth a try, and worth buying a bottle if you can find it on special.

3.0,"Appearance: The color this Irish explorer is showing off is a deep gold, with thin but viscous legs holding on to the inside of the glass.

Nose: The nose is similar to its stout brother, but more floral and with a funky hops note added in. Buscuity bread, straw in a barn, dried orange rind, cinnamon, and sawdust notes also find their way into the lovely nose.

Taste: The palate is smooth coming in, smoother even than the Caskmates Stout if you can believe it. There is definitely the slight taste of a hoppy IPA beer in this dram, which, IPA’s being not my favorite style of beer I thought I wouldn’t like, however, this meshes with the standard Jameson so well! Heavy notes of orange and grapefruit, with notes of baking spices add to the palate as well.

Finish: The finish is less harsh than the Caskmates Stout and with no burn. The finish is short to medium and leaves a hoppy bitter aftertaste and also a fresh clean feeling that reminds me of a Colorado bourbon.

Thoughts: I compared this to the Jameson Caskmates Stout Edition, as you could probably tell, which I really enjoy! I wasn’t expecting much from this Irish whiskey, but shoot, I like it a lot! It’s not overwhelmingly bitter or IPAesk, but you can definitely detect the influence, especially if you’re familiar with the standard Jameson. I’m so glad I tried this, I would definitely recommend it and would buy this again! Thanks for a good dram Jameson! Sláinte!"

3.25,"My wife bought a bottle of the standard Jameson and it came with a miniature of both the stout and IPA editions of the Caskmates expressions, so I decided to do a side by side. 

The IPA Caskmates is the standard Jameson that is finished in casks that once held IPA beer. It’s bottled at 40% ABV and is chill filtered and has colorant added making it a honey gold. 

The nose is very light, even compared to standard Jameson. Light cereal malt, some citrus notes. I would have to describe this as “crisp”. Grapefruit hops with a lemon note. Some faint honey and even fainter oak. There is a real lack of complexity here. Hoppy and floral and every now and then there is a light soapy note and a hint of pine. 

The palate has a surprising burst of grapefruit hops. Much stronger than the nose would indicate. Very creamy, some vanilla, very citrusy. Lemons and grapefruit. The IPA influence here is stronger than the stout influence was. Not much else to speak of. 

A medium light bodied mouthfeel that is creamy and mouthwatering. 
The finish is medium long, all grapefruit and grain alcohol. 

Again...it’s Jameson. The same, only different. The palate on this one is the most different of all the Jameson’s I’ve had. It’s definitely a one trick pony though. A serious lack of depth. For $33 it’s not terrible, but I’d rather get something else. 3.25

2.75,"This is surprisingly so much less flavorful than the stout edition, but that speaks volumes to those two types of beer. The smell is that of a more citrus-full Jameson, but not any lighter. The taste almost perfectly reflects this as well. Take the base flavor of Jameson, and make it more potent, as if the proof were increased, but also simply not as light or ""well"" tasting as the original stuff. If there is any beer taste here, it is that of an extremely low ABV and very light IPA, because almost nothing but a glimmer of domestic beer hops comes through. I suppose there is a faint bitterness on the finish, but not enough for me to vote it coming from a beer rather than from a whiskey taste profile. Rating this based on how the IPA taste comes through would make it much lower. Instead, I'd like to rate this based on an imaginary ""Jameson: Enhanced Barrel"" product, as this would be better known as."

Palate has definite grapefuit/musk/pine tones from the beer. I think it was 'just right' but if you were having an ipa with this it probably would be too tame. Theres a fantastic lemon and butter kiss after the IPA that really, really makes me wish Jamo would put out more ""step-up from standard jamo"" offerings. Reminds me of something I'd fill a flask with for a nice classy night out in my younger days.

Finish is nice and crisp. Pot-still (while not totally) by the big name is expectedly enjoyable. The fun open and refined bite make for a very refreshing dram indeed.

Was torn between 3.25 and 3.5 but it gets that little extra bit for being so well-composed."

4.75,Great IPA finish
3.0,"Nose: Take that classic Jameson buttery lemon tart and crank up the citrus, as well as the dairy funk.  Brittle grain character shining through with some malt backbone.  This presents much more lively than the 80 proof labeling would lead you to expect.  Floral (think roses) and grassy.  Novel, but the hops are sitting on top of everything and are wavering between being appealing and unappealing.

Palate: None of the unappealing qualities from the nose.  Classic Jamo buttery lemon tart with more vanilla.  Mint, thyme, and basil.  Cinnamon, sugar, nutmeg, allspice.  The hops are combining with the barrel to provide a sort of faux barrel bitter/bite thing that I'm not hating.  The addition of more bitterness is mostly just helping amp up the classic Jamo flavor profile.  Mouthfeel is medium-light, though oily and hangs around.  Finish is medium-short and starts with coffee, vanilla, sugar, and - surprise - bitter, herbal character.  Vanilla and sugar hang out while mint and cream pop into play - slightly minty whipped cream comes to mind.  Things slowly fade off until you're left with classic Jameson.

Other notes: The nose on this is what kills it for me.  It's 95% good, but there's this sour-in-a-bad-way interaction between the hops and the buttery citrus thing that's just unappealing enough to make me pause.  Funny, too, because with beer I'm all about big, bold, heavily hopped IPAs, Imperial Stouts, etc.  The hops seem to ""mask"" the metallic character you normally get from Jameson.  This has just enough variation from your baseline Jamo for this to be worth a buy just for the novelty of it, but not something I'd actively seek out for myself in the future."

3.75,"This is a nice/normal dram, appealing in the nose but fails to deliver in the palate. It is kind of an experiment from jameson to mature the whiskey (with an ""e"") in stout beer barrels.

Bottled at 40% abv amber color.

On the nose, hay, forest, hops (like beer), beer foam, cream, latex and coffee. Interesting, fragant, very appealing. 

On the palate, as i said befor things start to fall apart (this is not an expensive whisky, so it was kind of fair for this to happen). Notes of chocolate but mostly rye grain, with a spicy rye finish, long. Not my cup of tea.

Overall i give this dram a fair score of 77 over 100, irish whiskies are still a bit unexplored by me, i need to improve the bottles i buy in the search for the perfect irish Whiskey."
