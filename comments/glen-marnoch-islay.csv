3.75,"You can’t beat the price. I feel like this is an imitation Laphroaig 10. 

The nose is damp earth and hay with a little sweet fruit in the back. Palate is a little thin at first but becomes oily as you hold it. Rich smouldering smoke and earthy notes. The finish is quite short with a lick of leather. 

£17.49 in ALDI in the UK. For the price, it’s fantastic. It’s not Laphroaig 10 or any of the top end Islay whiskies but it is lovely."

2.0,"No one else has commented on this absurdly cheap Aldi whiskey, so I suppose it’s down to me. I tasted it straight after a couple of Taliskers, so the competition is stiff. Still, Aldi products have repeatedly won blind taste tests so it’s important to be open minded. 

The colour is pale straw, like an Ardbeg, but the aroma is like iodine daubed on burnt bicycle tires. Not so good. The first taste yields smoke and, er, that’s about it. No fruit, that I can detect, and not much Islay chewy meatiness. They say this stuff is actually Caol Ila or Lagavulin, but if so they’re scraping the bottom of the barrel with this expression. I would love to be shown that a 20 quid whiskey can be a giant killer, but this ain’t it."
