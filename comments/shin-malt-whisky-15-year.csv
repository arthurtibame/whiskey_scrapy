4.25,"Nose - plum, brandy, port wine, nutmeg, stewed pear, rum chocolate, caramel, hazelnut, mild ethanol burn. 

Taste - caramel, black pepper, plum, black cherry, nutmeg, rich chocolate, green spicy wood, moderate alcohol burn, finishing reasonably long with lingering spicy chocolate wordiness.

Surprisingly complex for a Japanese whiskey. I find the wood flavor very interesting. Nothing like American oak; the mizunara imparts a spiciness that is really pleasant and interesting."
