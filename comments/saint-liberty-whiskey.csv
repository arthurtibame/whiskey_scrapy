2.75,"The stories behind Saint Liberty bottles are based on historical women. Overall a nice tribute and marketing touch, but the juice is what matters so let's give it a try. 

Well the nose is damn funky. Like some 70's B-reel movie score funk. I am truly at a loss on this one. No brown sugar or vanilla here, just funk. 

First sip is muddled to be honest. Some vanilla, some leather, some charring, but no stand outs here. Finish is a bit lackluster and leaves a slightly burned flavor. The overall pour isn't worth the price of admission in my book, but hey at least the bottle is cool!"
3.75,"Very soft and full rounded sweet molasses beginning. Touch of smoke? Corn forward and easy finish, little to no burn."
4.0,"A unique bourbon to say the least. I really enjoyed the flavor, lots of caramel and smoky finish. Leaves a nice flavor in your mouth that isn’t too harsh, but warm."
5.0,"This is unlike any Texas bourbon I’ve ever had. I get dark molasses upfront, burnt brown sugar on the back end, a little vanilla and stone fruit with a hint of smoke. Exceptionally smooth and not hot upfront like other Texas Bourbons."
5.0,"Love it. The juice is interesting, unlike anything else I have had the grain [corn] is forward and spicy [rye] finish. Cool bottle and great story about the woman who inspired it."
