4.5,"On the nose, it’s noticeably more bright and fruity than the standard Harbinger barrel proof. Mixed berries greet me right away, underpinned by a bed of vanilla and caramel. Doesn’t smell too hot, not too much oak on the nose. On the palate, I get a good bit of heat up front, but as it dissipates, I’m met with more fresh berries, some floral character and a bready grainy finish. The mouthfeel is not quite as thick as other high proof Ironroot products, which is fine. The finish lingers for a mile. It feels like I mixed the mixed berry V8 V-fusion (the 100% juice kind, not that V8 Splash crap) with a sweet bourbon and a dash of toffee, and that’s what hangs out in my mouth for a while. Said plainly, it’s just dandy. I like it just as much, if not slightly more, than the original barrel proof."
