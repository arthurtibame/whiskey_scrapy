5.0,"This glorious single barreled treat is dark copper in color with very thin oily legs. This bourbon is a delight to look upon.

The savory nose explodes with delicious notes of sweet corn, BBQ sauce, caramel candy apples, citrus, vanilla, aspen dust, cloves, and mint.

The palate starts with intense heat to begin, then eases into notes of cinnamon, rich syrupy cherry, caramel, honey, brown sugar, smoke and char. With a splash of water it’s more reminiscent of an old fashioned with the notes of cherry and orange turned up.

The finish is lingering, cinnamony, and very dry yet sweet, like eating a s’more.

My particular bottle is one of 49 from barrel 543. I am a big fan of this whiskey and think the uncut proof allows the flavors and ruggedness to flow unbridled! I definitely recommend! Thanks 291! Cheers!"
