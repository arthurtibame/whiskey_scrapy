3.0,"Appearance: In this whiskey blend my friend brought back for me from his mission trip to Nepal, I look in my glass and notice a light honey color, with super thin and oily legs.

Nose: As I bring the glass up to take a whiff, I get fresh notes of green apple, pear, salty brine and light peat, honey and flowers, and damp forest and hay.

Taste: The palate has, as I take a sip, a creamy mouthfeel, and is pretty warm going down at first. Notes of ash, honey, red apple, cherry flavored candy, and sea brine traverse the tongue.

Finish: The finish is medium long, dry and ashy.

Thoughts: This whiskey was surprisingly good. It was a fun gift to receive, maybe not worth hunting down, but still good. I’m glad I got to try it! Thanks, Spencer and Old Durbar! Sláinte!"
