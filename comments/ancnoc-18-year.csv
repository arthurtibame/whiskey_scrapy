So memory...I thought it was ok, nothing special...beyond that I'll leave it up to Cam and JoeC to provide more detailed notes :-). I have samples of the 22 and 24 which I'll have to crack open sometime."

3.0,"You kind of have to really dig lumber for this one. The nose and palate have elements of walnut and nutmeg, with hints of orange marmalade, but I find the oak to be a little overbearing on the more delicate competing aromas. Still, this isn't a bad whisky at all . Just not my kind of whisky."

4.0,"This is the first note in a series coming from an Inver House tasting/master class this evening. The anCnoc 18 was the second dram of the night (after the 12 year), and it is quite something. The 12 year old anCnoc is a light, fresh, fruity affair; this, meanwhile, sees some time in 1st fill Oloroso sherry casks, and it shows. Rich, full, and abounding in chocolate-covered raisin notes, spices, and nutty notes, this is a darker, much more indulgent affair than its younger predecessor. It's still perhaps a bit too straightforward to get five stars from me, but this is a fine whisky well worth seeking out and savoring."

4.0,"A nose of maple syrup and honey.  A soft palate of sherry, toffee and chocolate.  Finishes sweet with a hint of white pepper. [Tasted: 6/17/15]"

4.25,"Nose - Very pleasant fruity caramel, fruity apple-berry cider, hint of blueberries

Taste - Sweet fruity apple-berry cider, golden raisins, hint of cayenne heat/spice, light caramel, lightly drying

Finish - Spicy gentle heat, lingering fruity caramel, dark apple/pear juice sweetness, golden raisins, hint of blueberry

Score - 88/100

Final Thoughts - This one was quite nice. A bit muted initially on the nose, but it eventually opens up a bit more. Very pleasant experience from start to finish with no off-putting notes. Nice balance of caramel sweet and fruit from the ex-bourbon & sherry.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes

Would I buy a bottle? - I'd be willing to pay up to $80 USD for this"
