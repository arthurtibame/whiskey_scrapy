2.0,"For those of you unfamiliar with Grangestone, it is one of Total Wine’s house brands, and they have both NAS and aged offerings, as well as blends. It’s a William Grant & Sons product, with the word on the street that it is likely distilled at their Kininvie distillery. I think Balvenie 14 Caribbean Cask is the only other rum finish I have tried, so I picked a bottle up, as it sounded kind of interesting and unusual (and was pretty inexpensive).

**Abv:** 40%

**Price:** $28.99 at Total Wine in Houston, Texas

**Setting:** Neat in a Glencairn, with a fat basset hound half in my lap.

**Color:** Orange

**Nose:** Tequila with salt, rum, baked apples, and baking spices. It smells really promising, with two different profiles that duel it out: one that is a dead ringer for tequila with salt, and the other that is more rum-like in character. Both of them are pleasant. **(18/25 points)**

**Taste:** Oranges, baked apples, baking spices, and cloves. Well that went south quickly. The rum flavors are there, but everything tastes dull and flat. **(25/50 points)**

**Finish:** Short. Alcohol, honey, and cloves. Blink and it’s gone. **(7/25) points)**

**Conclusion:** This is pretty terrible stuff. The nose starts out promising, and then the taste and finish really go off a cliff. I do wonder if it degraded some in the bottle, as I opened this particular bottle about five months ago and I remember it being more mediocre than bad. I’ll still finish the bottle, but this experience has turned me off to Grangestone. If anyone else has tried any other Grangestone products, I’d be curious to hear your experiences.

**50/100**"

A good whiskey to buy someone you don’t like very much but you know they like rum. Just make sure you leave before they drink it."

2.5,"Decided to try a few of the Total Wine brands. Got a couple scotches and a bourbon. I really love the Balvenie rum cask so was hopeful. Poured neat, the nose is promising with nice sweet island fruits from the rum cask. Little dose of malt and some barrel wood as well. Its a bit light but still pleasant. Palate starts out good with fruity rum sweetened malt but drops away to dry oak and straw. Not much depth to speak of , this is just too young and has yet to develop any strong flavor or complexity. Its not bad or offensive its just lacking. I like where its heading if it had more time it might get there. Finish is short with dry oak and distant malt, the rum influence a memory in the back. Overall its still a decent budget single malt with some rummy overtones. Im at the point where I need more body and weight from my scotch so would not repurchase........ 75/100.......comparing this to the Balvenie 14 is like high school football to the NFL"

2.75,"Picked up at Total Wine in Laurel, MD. Signs said only at Total Wine, or something like that. Overall nice selection but didn’t find anything I couldn’t do without. Overall, Scotch is decent for the price.  But not as good as Dewars."
