4.0,"Bronze color when held to the light. Sweet, warm fruit on the nose along with a hint of leather. Body is very vanilla and rich, but not too heavy. Warming. More warmth on the finish along with more vanilla. Very good!"
2.0,Good base for a rye and ginger.  Nothing close to a neat sipping whisky

2.0,"Burnt caramel with subtle vanilla, charred oak dominates. Lingering raw charcoal absolutely prevents it from being a sipping whiskey. It does make a good sour though. $29 in Ontario."
4.0,"The  small batch version of this is delicious. Yes, it is sweet, but I for one tend to appreciate that in a whisky when the mood strikes. Probably the smoothest whisky I've ever tried. Haven't had the original version, so I can't compare."

0.5,"One of the few whiskeys I've come close to pouring down the sink.

Caramel. That's all there is. It's sickly sweet, fat, dull, totally devoid of character and costs too much.  Sounds like some politicians.

I've given this half a point in recognition of the fact that it isn't actually poisonous.

""Poor"" : 0.5 stars"

3.0,"3.5/5 - If you like standard Canadian blended whisky, you will like this a lot.  Loads of maple, vanilla and sharp ethenol on the nose.  Taste is buttery and sweet, goes down smoothly which is important for Canadian blends, at least to me.   Compaired this to Wisers deluxe, and it blew the doors of it in terms of refinement and depth of flavor.  Not as good as the higher avb/higher rye whiskies but it's a different style.  This one is for fans of classic Canadian blended whisky that don't want anything too harsh."

5.0,"It’s all a matter of perspective. When one calls this whisky lacking complexity another can call it highly refined. When one says it’s missing character another can call it exceedingly smooth. To me, CC 12 is probably one of the most refined, sophisticated whiskies available. Does it have bold flavors? Not at all. Does it grab your attention? It’s too well-mannered for that.  What you have here is a pure expression of an elegant Canadian...it’s polite, smooth, and refined. If you seek a brown spirit that will not offend, then look no more, CC12 is it. What Crown Royal claims, CC12 delivers."

3.0,"Like a lot of the Canadian Club line, it's not an exceptionally deep or complicated spirit, but if you need that, you're looking in the wrong place. Think of the spirit itself to act as a fairly pure vehicle of the long wood essence. The underlying spirits is fairly neutral so you get a lovely expression of undaunted wood and vanilla. It's smooth, but not nearly as much as the blended Scotch of equivalent age (Chivas or Dewars, for instance). A bit of old world meets new world. 

I like it.  But only when I'm in the mood."
4.5,"Nose: Maple, caramel, toffee, sap, wood spice,dried fruits (raisins, prunes, dates), dark fruits (figs, plum, blackberries) a little orange and candied lemon/lemon rind, sherry,butterscotch, rye greenness, hint of medium roast coffee, hint of pine, sweet creaminess, earthiness (slightest hint of rich tobacco, light chocolate) 

Palate: Caramel, vanilla, toffee, butterscotch, tannins, peppery spice, sherry, slight spicy bitterness, slight creamy sweetness, maple sugar, charred oak, wood sweetness, dried fruit, dark berries 

Finish: Dried fruit, molasses, spicy bitterness, rye, hint of creaminess, fig"

2.5,"Look: Like a bourbon really: burnt orange, gold hues on the edges.  Lacing, legs.

Nose: sweetness, little to no spice or diversity seems like. Mainly a grainy smell I’d say. Swirling opens more ethanol than I’ve smelled in a whiskey.

Palate: sweet as the nose insinuated, little bit more flavor though. Caramel and vanilla. 

Finish: somewhat astringent, some burn but no barrel at all. Reminds me of a rum almost.

Overall: I use this for manhattans and old fashioneds, but figured I should give it a fair shake. Not the greatest neat."
