4.0,"Honey nose, not as sweet on the palate but also not too hot. Toasty and buttery."

1.0,"Nose of wheat and prairie in bloom.  Very young whiskey.  Taste starts sweet, quickly moves to spice.  Whiskey is a little thin.  Finish is terrible; medium with aspects of paint thinner mixed with wheat and spice.  This whiskey could use a lot more time in the barrell before bottling.  Best not to drink neat; works better as a mixer.  Should be bottom shelf price point.  It is definitely not worth premium pricing."
