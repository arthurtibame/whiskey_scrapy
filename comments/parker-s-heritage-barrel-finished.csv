4.5,"This sample came to me by way of a bourbon brother.  The Parkers Heritage line has never let me down and this year is no exception!  This is a limited availability bottle, released once a year with a different expression.
Nose: light vanilla with soft citrus notes, orange lollipop and Terry's chocolate oranges.  Really enjoying the aroma.
Palate: The citrus notes are very soft and slightly medicinal but not at all over powering, burnt grapefruit, nutmeg & marmalade. (side note I thought it reminded me of a scotch for a second).
Finish: A bit if fire up front but fades quickly leaving you looking for another sip.
Body: medium complexity, slight oil but lighter then expected, smooth for 110 proof.

Very enjoyable and if your looking for a unique bottle that stands apart from the pack this is your guy.  As always keep drinking my friends... Skol"

3.75,Good nose thin body a little hot. Needs more age
4.25,Rich bourbon underneath a orange marmalade. Tastes like an expensive bottle of bourbon mixed with an orange flavored dessert. Better than I expected based off other reviews. Let it breath for a little bit.

3.0,"Bracing myself for the blast of orange on the nose, but it's very mild. Noticeable, but mild. On the palate, it's there as well, but not overpowering. Smooth with leather. The citrus is there, but more like bitter zest, not like orange juice. Good change of pace. 10/20/18

More orange on the nose this time. A musty note on the palate. Citrus zest. Smooth for the proof. Good change of pace. 11/30/18"

4.0,"this is fantastic bourbon. hot but not complete fire, easy drinking but not dis interesting. something I'd love to have on my shelf, but at $90 it's not significantly enough better than bourbons at roughly half the price for me to justify buying a bottle."
5.0,"This is a unique tasting, which I truly appreciate. Definitely has orange bitter taste but it mixes surprisingly well with oak and caramel. I had low expectations going into this one and was pleasantly surprised. Deserves more than 4 stars but not quite 5."

3.75,"The orange hits the nose like the spray of a freshly twisted peel, but is very subtle in the palate. Add a couple drops of water and dive into vanilla, oak and spice. The finish has a pleasant little hint of bitter pith that draws out the faintest lingering of tobacco. Find it, buy it, drink it!"

2.0,Way too much orange. Tastes like flavored whiskey

4.25,Opportunity to try a pour with Ryan at Dean's Liquor.  Was surprised I enjoyed as much as I did...
3.75,"Novel whiskey but not as complex as I would have liked. Nose is exciting with citrus and candied orange as well as typical whiskey undertones like toffee and vanilla. The palate initially comes on with the anticipated orange but becomes quickly hot, even with water added. The heat and orange cover the whiskey flavors that only show thru occasionally. The finish is shorter/muted. Enjoyable but doesn’t quite live up to the hype."

null,"Aside from the 24 year expression - I find Parker’s to be overrated - primarily because of the thin mouth feel and quick finish; I want my unicorn whiskey to have “muscle” to it, blow me away, dance on my tongue- that’s not this whiskey - it’s similar to the 11 year; thin, hot, dry mouth feel, big young bitter lingering oak, quick finish... forgettable. 🤷🏼‍♂️"
4.0,The orange curaçao comes through in the finish which is actually quite nice. Not overpowering but provides an added sweetness. Really nice pour.

4.25,Smooth.  Can taste the orange very easily.  Excellent dessert bourbon. Not worth the price though.  Plenty of other good bourbons for under $50 that are equally as tasty.

4.0,"I received a sample of this bourbon from a guy I work with whose father in law is as much into bourbon as I am into scotch, but with a bigger budget. Parker’s Heritage is known for doing different barrel finishes, this one was matured 7-8 years and then spent 4 months in orange curaçao barrels. What’s orange curaçao you ask?  Well I’ll tell you. It is a liqueur that is flavored with bitter orange peels. Technically it’s the peels of the Laraha citrus fruit. What’s the Laraha citrus fruit you ask?  Well I’ll tell you. It’s a descendant of the bitter orange and the fruit is too bitter and fibrous to be considered edible. Why is it called curaçao and not Laraha you ask?  Well I’ll tell you. The Laraha grows on the island of Curaçao located in the southern Caribbean Sea just north of Venezuela and east of Aruba. The Laraha is also known as the Curaçao Orange. Any time I mention oranges in this review, please note that I am specifically referring to the Laraha citrus fruit. Enough botany for today?  Good, let’s get on to the whiskey. Bottled at 55% ABV and is non chill filtered and natural color of a red mahogany with orange hues. A very pretty color.   

The nose is dominated by the orange curaçao from the get go. Strong orange oil, orange peel and oak. A definite pine note as well. Orange sherbet/creamsicle, candied oranges. Equally sweet and bitter. The nose just screams mid to late October with baking spices, oak and oranges. Very unique. Some vanilla and chocolate start to come through along with candy corn. Baked apples & pears, brown sugar and caramel. Nutty, perhaps Brazil or pecans. Strong barrel char and a hint of mint. 
Water brings out more sweetness and tones down the bitterness, warmer with more of the classic bourbon notes. More caramel, toffee, vanilla custard and buttercream frosting. More corn. 

The palate is sweet for the first couple seconds, then a wave of spice takes over. On the bitter side after that with orange peel/oil. Oranges & cream, strong oak and a bit nutty. Corn, candy corn, some rye spice and ginger. 
With water there is just as much orange, but it’s sweeter, less bitter. Vanilla and even some coconut. 

A full bodied mouthfeel that is oily and mouth coating. 
The finish is medium long with orange pith, vanilla, oak and very dry. 

I didn’t expect quite this much orange flavor from only 4 months in liqueur barrels, but here we are, in a proverbial orange grove holding a glass of bourbon with an orange twist. I can only see this as a once in a while type of dram as it’s just too strange to be an every day sipper. I’m happy to have tried it, but once is enough for me. A solid 4 though. 
Cheers"

2.25,"Taste:  2 oz neat in glen cairn, and then 3 drops water.

Nose:  (2.5)  Ethanol, orange rinds and some burnt vanilla.  There is a bitterness here that turns me off, but there is enough interest to make me want to keep on pushing to see where this goes.

Palate: (2.25)  Bitter orange rind here is what I strongly get.  Water seems to make the bitterness worse.  Tastes how an Old Fashioned would be if no sugar cubes or bar syrup were added, and it was overly dashed with orange bitters.  There is no sweetness here whatsoever.

Finsh:  (2.25)  The burn is raw with this one.  I do get a bit of vanilla after the orange rind wears off but it tastes like immitation vanilla that you might use for baking.  Also I get a bit of soapiness.

Overall: Had so much excitement for this one that fell short.  I was hoping for a sweet, rich, warming sipper that might be more of a dreamsicle.  What I got was more like chewing on a bourbon soaked orange rind.  The redeeming quality is that I think with a few sugar cubes (definately no bitters needed), some ice, and some luxardo cherries, this will be an out of the bottle, almost pre-made Old Fashioned...... but an expensive one at that.  Walk away from this one."
4.25,"Distinct orange peel and cinnamon on the nose. Flavor continues into the pallets. Spicy and fruity like a holiday stewed fruit cocktail. Not much complexity here, but very drinkable. Good luck finding it."

Very good! Great finish!"
4.75,"Spicy and sweet. Very balanced. Harder to find, and a bit on the pricier side. Really smooth and yet enough spice to please a rye lover."
2.0,"A sample gifted from the ""Whiskey Transfer Program"" from dthom.  I feel like I say this a lot but...I really wanted to like this.  

Nose: I hate the way this smells.  It smells like burnt orange (which I like) mixed with eucalyptus and mint (which I don't want anywhere near my whiskey).  

Taste: Candied orange and corn flakes.  Not super complex which is not at all what I'd expect.  A little hot at first.

Finish: More mint, heavily sweet candied orange, cedar, and baking spices.  A long and hot finish.

I think the thing is that I like a lot of the individual flavors/scents as I pick them out but I don't like them together.  Mint/eucalyptus/orange...Wrong!!    Mint/orange/cedar/baking spices...WRONG!!  It just clashes with itself.  This whiskey doesn't know what it wants to be and is trying to be all things to all people.  Sometimes barrel finishes just don't work and this is an example."

2.5,"Decent bourbon and you could definitely taste the orange within the tasting notes. I can't say that I'm a fan of this within the taste and won't try another drink of it. 

I wanted to try this first before I bought a bottle and am glad I did cause I don't think it's worth the after market price tag of $200+.

Either way I'll give another try of Parker's without the orange and see if I like the brand first. First try is a fail however.."

Taste: fresh orange on the front. Leads to a bold (but not overpowering) spice, tastes like a fall treat. Finish is a mellowing of the spice, leaves me ready for the next sip. Super clean.

This was hyped up to me and did not disappoint. I was given a sample and now I'd like a bottle. I'd keep this around for awhile."

4.5,"Out the gate this has some serious heat and alcohol burn, give it an ice cube and 5-10 mins and you'd think it's 80 proof. So damn smooth and orangey with a woody finish and I am a huge fan. You can tell it's viscous but it resists coating your mouth. Doesn't taste as young as it is."

4.75,"This is fantastic, and really unique due to the barrell finish.  I concur with the expert notes, but would take it one step further.  I love finishes that taste like a truly integrated part of the whiskey, as opposed to throwing a sheen over the top of it.   I have yet to taste a bourbon that accomplishes that better than this one. The orange notes are quite beautiful and prevalent on both the nose and palate, but delicately enhance the beautiful base boubon. This is hard to find for sale; I was very lucky to be offered a taste by the owner of Fluke Newport in Newport RI.  If you're in the area, head up to the bar on the third floor - they have an awesome selection of rare American whiskeys of all types!"

4.0,"$24 for 1.5 ounces at Daikaya Ramen

This was a great dessert after a bowl of tonkotsu ramen.  The orange flavors made this a very unique experience for me, and one I want to go back to.  At 7-8 years of age, this had the perfect amount of wood influence - a spicy vanilla and just a touch of dark chocolate bitterness.  There is a fair amount of rye spices as well, as the mashbill is 10% rye.  The orange curacao barrels infuses just the right amount of clementines and candied oranges.  It really provides a needed extra-dimensional jaunt of fruitiness, as I find most traditional bourbons to have a one-dimensional and repetitive fruity profile.  The orange liqueur finish, for me, does not take over, and this does not feel at any point like a cocktail or flavored whisky.  I know I am still drinking bourbon.  If you are a bourbon purist, you will disagree, and find this whisky overpriced even at MSRP.  Not that it matters because if you find this bottle, it probably won’t be at MSRP.

Unfortunately, Parker’s Heritage is one of those “highly allocated” bourbon releases that is unavailable in bottle form to someone like me, who simply does not care enough to chase bottles.

Score: * (unforgettably good)
How much does a bottle cost: $90-100 at retail.  $250-500 on secondary.

3.0,"@Soba45 and I were chatting about this dram a few days back and I told him I'd post a review after trying it at an event I hosted for the Arizona Whiskey Community! As part of the event this dram was being poured for $15/2oz. Great price now let's see if it lives up to the Parker's Heritage name .. 

It enters with a lovely mouthfeel and initial notes are Classic Bourbon, vanilla, toffee and seasoned oak. You are then quickly smacked with orange marmalade and orange peel. Finish is medium and more of the same with the orange marmalade note dominating the experience. 

I was surprised when I realized it was 55%abv as it drinks well below that! All in all it's a perfectly acceptable dram but doesn't excel in any way. Unlike the Willett XCF, it lacks the spice backbone to counter act the cask. 

If you can find it for this price for a pour it's a buy. Id pass on a bottle even if offered one at the $90 retail. Cheers all!"

2.0,"Nose- orange zest, ethanol, caramel, oak

Palate- candied orange, oak, sweet caramel, honey, long bitter note. Wave of raisins washes over the bitterness. 

Finish- medium, odd finish of artificial orange juice and spice

A swing and a miss from Parker’s heritage. I tried this out of curiosity. It was very unique- and has flashes of great flavors on the palate, but the nose is weak, and the palate has this bitter taste that seems to overpower the rest of the notes."

After that other than an actual orange in whole or juice form nothing orange has crossed my lips. Now i didn't realise what curacao was until I took a sniff of this one and thought hmm smells like mint and something else, took a sip and then spat it out as heavily ethanoled orangeness assaulted my palate. After a heavy dosing of water...argh no it really isn't doing it for me. If you like high abv base ethanol mixed with peppermint and orange liqueur you'll love this. Eventually swirling around the mouth wasn't too bad even enjoyable to a degree but then having to swallow and that aftertaste... i'm with @dubz480 on this one a very charitable 3."

3.5,Good bourbon but a little too orange-y for me.
4.5,Nose like a chocolate orange. Heavy acidic fruit on the palate. Becones a delicious bourbon on the finish.
4.25,"Neat. Neck pour.  Oh that is a funky adventure.  The orange curaçao punches you in the face.  I like it a lot.  Though the orange is so loud you can find your way behind it.  Peanuts.  Caramel,  chocolate. Then a hint of oak.  The more time you spend with it the orange note begins to meld with a vanilla note too.  Like a dreamciscle.

Nice creamy mouth feel with overwhelming flavor the moment it hits the tip of the tongue.  It’s dreamcicle and oak on the tongue.  The taste and finish just match the nose.  Peanuts, caramel, barrel spice, oak.  It is very tannic.  It really dries the mouth.

This is a fun experience.  That orange is crazy and overwhelming.  It’s really delicious.  It does dry the mouth to such an extreme that it is a bit off putting.  It’s a novelty.  A good novelty, but a novelty none the less."
