Good"
4.25,"Nose: Cherry cola, plum, brown sugar, cinnamon
Palate: Oily mouthfeel.  Black cherry, baking spices, mint.  Oak and clove finish"
4.25,"Nose: cherry and spices. Can tell it’s a rye
Palate: cherry right on the start. Very rich/bitter middle. It’s not like normal port finishes, not as dry. The rye is subtle
Finish: the wine comes through finally and rye sits on your tongue with a little bit of sweetness"

2.5,Christmas tree nose. Not getting what everyone else gets on the palate and finish. Did the guy I got my taste from pull one over on me? Not a big fan.

4.0,"Nose- Rye, spice, caramel, some floral notes 

Palate- sweet up front, caramel and spicy 

Finish- decently long finish, spicy but sweet"
4.5,"Act 7 scene 2, this was always so hard to find and now I see it all over, definitely the best offering from High West that I have had.  Too much going on in the nose so all I can say is spice...palate is full of baking spices and other holiday flavors...definitely one to sit and sip by the fire."

4.25,"This bottle is Act 7 Scene 5
The nose has dusty rye, vanilla, light fruit like pears and fresh red apple, raisins, baking spices, leather, and a slight sour note.

The palate is oily with dusty rye, grapey notes, sweet vanilla, and mulling spices and leather

The finish is long-ish with lingering rye,  vanilla, old grapey-ness  (port wine finish) with a slight bitterness.

This is very good. Fairly easy to drink, pleasant mouthfeel and flavors on the palate. Not sure if I’d spend $100 again, but I enjoy it."

3.75,This is a beautiful copper reddish color.  To me nose is pretty standard mgp rye.  It’s kinda thin.  Typical rye spice and pepper.  Finish is medium with cinnamon and black pepper.  I’m not wowed but this and when this bottle is gone I won’t seek out another.

5.0,"Amazing on the nose. Hints if cinnamon an raisins, plum, and sugar. Reminds me of a less carmely Buffalo Trace. 

Spicier on the entry than I expected. Not in a warm way, in a peppery way. A tiny bit flatter in the middle, but not in a bad way. Spicy, spicy finish too. Kind of dry on the finish too. Very unique!!"
3.75,"Definitely a rye.  Spice and a touch of fruit in the nose.

Taste is spicey, oak, and light vanilla sweetness.

Finish is long for the 98ish proof. Dry and spicey."

4.5,"Nose: sweet heavy orange peel, 
Palette: rich smooth rye, hint of herbs spices, sweet
Finish: bold spice lingering"
4.75,"Neat (Act 5 Scene 4)

Nose: milky chocolate caramel. 

Palate: amazing complexity and range. Smoother than a babies bottom. Tastes to me like milky chocolate, or if you’ve ever been to a south / Central American country, tastes like Milo mix."

4.5,"Act 7 Scene 2

Aroma is so well integrated that picking out individual notes takes some effort. Smells “good” but digging in finds wintergreen, nutmeg, bubblegum, honey, dill, cinnamon, chocolate covered cherry, and a hint of anise. 

Flavor opens with a balanced buttery sweetness heavy with baking spices and molasses; like a Christmas cookie. Flavors are rich and very rounded. No one flavor stands out. Transitions very smoothly to the finish. 

Finish is loooooong with cinnamon, apricot, while pepper, mint, oak, and a hint a dill. Mouthfeel is full and caresses the tongue. 

What stands out here is how balanced and full flavored this is while at the same time exhibiting softness and delicacy. Ideal for those nights when you want something a little subdued without sacrificing anything. Top notch and would rebuy again that the $75 price I paid."
