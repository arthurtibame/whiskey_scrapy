4.75,"Oily and peaty, feels almost gritty on the tongue in the aftertaste.  Taste of new leather and licorice balanced with the peat. Beautiful smokey finish, very hard to tell it is 59.5 ABV."
4.75,"Nose- Sweet peat, pineapple juice, seaweed, butterscotch, caramel, almonds, creamy vanilla, mushy banana (what a nose)

Palate- Wave of spice, sea spray, heavy peat, oranges, lemons, butterscotch, and honey

Finish- Long, spicy and mouth tingling finish with notes of peat smoke, lemons, sweet honey, and a bit of ash


The tears on the glass are AMAZING. Like literal molasses in a glass. What a complex dram. The nose goes on and on and on and on and on. The palate has lovely peat with layers of citrus, sugared sweets, and seaside influence. The finish tingles the tongue, coats the mouth, and seemingly lasts forever. The finish wraps up with a little bit of everything... sweetness and peatness. This rocks"

4.0,A wonderful whisky with a great mouthfeel. The palate is especially surprising with its strong notes of strawberries. It's only downfall is the finish... It's too short.

4.25,"My experience with Octomore 7.1 reminds me of a time as a kid when I spent most of my paper route money on a cherry bomb expecting to rock the neighborhood, but instead of a mighty blast I got a fizzler. The level of peat on the nose is faint at best and all efforts to release the peat serpent went for not. I tried the “Murray method” (neat), a few drops of water, dilute to 40%, dilute to 30%, a pile of ice, and still nothing.  I then summonsed the opinions of 3 friends and we all concurred; the peat in this spirit is very subtle on both nose and palate. Despite this fact, we all further agreed this whisky to be monumental! It’s oily and smooth giving hints of honey, vanilla, and almond with a lengthy, fruity, and effervescent finish. The taste of nobility is unquestionable, but don’t expect to get punched in the face with the peat of a Lagavulin, as one friend put it. Distilleries measure and advertise phenols based on the malted barley after kilning. The new make spirit can drop to 40% of that figure in ppm, and after 10 years it can drop to 20-25%. A handful of different phenols in the spirit also change percentages during distillation and over time creating a myriad of possibilities for new offerings to the peat loving consumer. Isn’t life wonderful?"

5.0,"It's time for a wonderful whisky tasting flight from the fine lads at Bruichladdich, on the island of Islay.  I'm enjoying the Wee Laddie Tasting Collection from these guys, which contains 3 200ml (8oz) samples of their core offerings:  Classic Laddie, Islay Barley, and Port Charlotte Scottish Barley Heavily Peated.  To run the entire gamut I've also opened a bottle of Octomore 7.1, in a valiant effort to go from unpeated all the way to the most heavily peated whisky in the world.

Bruichladdich Octomore Edition 07.1:  this is the final Octomore released under Master Distiller Jim McEwan.  He decided to go out with a bang after 52 years with the highest ppm Octomore yet- a mind-blowing 208ppm!  That's 5x higher than the Port Charlotte I just drank.  This bottling comes in at a cask strength of 119 proof and spent 5 years in American oak.  It's a bit darker than all the other whiskies (despite being younger) from the flight and slides down the taster glass like syrup over pancakes.  I believe I could use this as engine oil in my truck long enough to get to and from my local watering hole when I go on a bender.

The nose is unrelenting:  smoke, worn leather, tobacco and earthy barnyard hay.  It's impossible to detect any subtle flavors at all.  I kind of expected smoke to waft from the bottle when I popped the heavy cork.  

Drinking this beast is incredible.  There's tons of smoke, but damn if it isn't unbelievably smooth- a tad unexpectedly sweet and nutty.  To be cask strength, I think it would be a crime to add water.  It isn't needed to cool it down, nor do I think a drop or two of water would open up a damn thing.  This is about peat, smoke and briny, Islay air.  You'll take it in as it is and you'll be happy about it.  No whining allowed.  This is Islay peated scotch that makes no excuses and wouldn't back down to anything else on that wind swept Isle.

It may not be for everybody, but any single malt Islay fan should definitely step up to the plate and give an Octomore bottling a go at least once in their lifetime.  I absolutely love this juice!  Cheers, my friends."

5.0,"I've heard aggressive whiskeys described as knowing your safe word (they bring you right up to the edge of unpleasant but not over). This one is a little different though. Oh it knows your safe word alright, but it doesn't matter how many times you shout pumpernickel she isn't going to stop because she knows you want more... And God damn if she isn't right!!! This whiskey is absolutely fantastic!!

Nose: Peat, brisket, cornbread, honey, cinnamon, butter scotch, apple, brine, and grass. I have yet to get this much on the nose from a whiskey.
  
Palate: Heavy peat, lemon, honey, brine. To put it simply it is sweet, salty, and peaty.
  
Finish: Peat and cornbread with honey, brine, and the warmth that comes with a 59.5% ABV."

4.0,"The second of the heads up reviews between the Octomore 07.1 and 07.2. This time it’s the 07.1, sample supplied to me by Lee. 

Like the 07.2, this is a 5 year old that is peated to a level of 208 ppm. Bottled at 59.5% ABV, non chill filtered and natural color of yellow gold. The maturation on this one is entirely American oak. 

The nose is earthy/vegetal peat smoke. Lemon cakes, salted caramels, honey and barley sugar. Vanilla, brown sugar, red licorice and some light oak. Mixed berry donut filling with some floral and herbal notes. 

The palate has oaky peat smoke, vanilla, toffee and salted caramels. Somewhat fruity with peaches and apricots. Some honey and a lemon/lime type citrus. Not complex, but that’s what I’ve come to expect from Octomore. 

Medium bodied mouthfeel that is very oily and mouthwatering. 
A medium long finish with vanilla, salt and smoky ashes. 

This is better than the 07.3, but about equal to the 07.2. All three are good, but none of them are spectacular. The smoke on this one was probably the most prevalent between the three. Again, the overall youth is apparent here, but again it’s very drinkable despite the high ABV. The smoke, fruits and smoothness make it a winner. Thanks again to @LeeEvolved for the sample. 4.25 
Cheers"

4.0,"I recall when and where I first had an Octomore. It was back in 2013 at Jack Rose Saloon and the pour was the 5.1/169.  I was really discovering how much I loved the peaty scotches and it was suggested I try it.  Needless to say, every part of the night was rememberable.  Since then, I have not had an Octomore until now through @Telex graciously providing me a sample.  And on this cold night, perfect for a nightcap. 

The nose is peaty, though not overpowering.  Sea spray on a winters gray day. Sulphur and ozone mixed with vanilla and brown sugar.  A small hint of fruitiness of Granny Smith apple and apricots. 

A deep, rich sooty smokey arrival that’s Cayenne peppery hot. A syrupy brown sugar sweetness with lemon tartness swings around once the pringly sensation subsides. The pins and needles sensation swings right back around with the peatiness towards the finish. 

A long lasting ashy finish with lemon zest and salted caramel. 

Peat-smoke as advertised is what you get.  Not overly complex. Packaged in a youthful and spry body keeps it somewhat erratic and energetic.  Throw a few more years on this (would venture this is about 8 years) and this will make a top notch whisky.  I love Bruichladdich and peated whiskies are what I enjoy most.  However, I can grab a Lagavulin 16 or Ardbeg/Laphroaig 10 for a fraction of the cost of this scotch and still enjoy a great peaty scotch.  That being said, this is worthy of a pour for those “peat heads”.  [88/100][Tasted: 3/16/18]"

5.0,A great find. Little cigar bar in San Diego. Found another Canadian. Women’s gold medal game on tv. Another Canadian at the bar (surprisingly unfriendly but he is fro. Toronto). Thick drink which is wonderful. What you pay is what you get. Not a 5 but lay definitely not a 4.
3.5,"Nose: Softly smoky at first, like all Octomores, but a little more ashy than usual. Gentle old oak and a definite iodine note with some lemon zest and barley sugar, but no maritime brine. Resin or eucalyptus - something sharply oily and aromatic. With water there's a solvent and nutty aroma but it remains an oddly cold and austere nose.

Palate: Spicy, oaky and astringent out of the gate. Grassy, but not herbal - just grassy. There's also a lemon-drop lolly flavour, almost like synthetic lemon. Big smoke starts to evolve with each sip and the essential watering brings out some more lemon and nuts. Good texture.

Finish: A long, dry and slightly nutty end with the predictable smoke.

Predictable - that's the word. What a terrible thing to have to say about any whisky, but that's how I call it. Not one of the most interesting I've tasted - almost as spirit driven as a can of gasoline.

I prefer Port Charlotte to Octomore and that may be the issue here, because I tasted this at a Sydney whisky shop tasting event where it was the 4th whisky of the flyte immediately after the lovely Port Charlotte Islay Barley. It would be interesting to sample this in isolation, but I'm not buying a bottle just to do that.

Anyway, the bride of Frankenstein always appealed to me more than the monster himself.

4.5,"A powerful, heavily peated dram that gains complexity and softens up with time in the glass. 
Nose: Sawdust, some dark fruit, dried herbs, even a touch of lemon citrus. Smoke, obviously, but the kind that you get past quickly.
Palate: Smoke initially, definitely that dry oak, but then plums and a variety of different fruity / citrusy flavors that change over time as the whisky mellows in the glass. 
Finish: Wisps of smoke and creosot, medium length in reality but sticks with you far longer. 
On the fence about getting a full bottle of this, but it's certainly unique. Wanna try a x.3 next."

To the palate it is very spirit forward with rich, malty grain notes, light fruit, and billowing smoke.  Wood spice, oak char, honey, lemon zest, pineapple, damp tree bark and vanilla pudding.
-
In the finish it becomes very smoky and drying with earthy spices and oak, leaving hints of salt water and sweet citrus.
—
With water added, the nose becomes a little lighter, reminding of fresh baked blondies.  Soft on the palate with a more intense salt and pepper note with a zing of candied citrus zest.  The finish lengthens with sweet smoke and dry oak.

4.25,"Branded as the world's most heavily peated whisky, Octomore is not for the faint of heart. Edition 07.1 combines 208 ppm, 59.5% ABV and 5 years of cask maturation in American oak. Mineral, fresh and less peated than expected, the nose unfolds with lemons, anise and fatty bacon. With a fiery blast of peat, the taste explodes on your palate: pepper, ash and spices mask hints of sweetness, lime and mint. Intense, briny and slightly bitter, the finish hangs around for hours. The rawness and pure energy of this spirit is outstanding, but so is the price tag.
