2.0,"For those who like Canadian whisky, I'd say this is a good alternative. Very sweet and soft in style, with some spice in the finish (rye content perhaps?) but moderately priced compared to the purple cloaked king of Canadians. I don't really see much of the bourbon in here and wish they were more forthcoming with the source, but we are talking American whiskey, so we know that won't happen."

4.0,"smells of syrup and fruits. Touches the tongue smooth, oily, syrupy. Just after the fruit taste comes up, it gets spicy, then finishes with a black pepper-like spice, but sweet. Both the fruity taste and tingle stay for about a minute. Aftertaste somewhat oily."

3.0,Solid sweet & spicy punch. Great for campfires & cold weather. Definition of old school American whiskey to me.

3.0,"This deserves better than a 63. Its corn sweet, with a plain Jane caramel note and a little spice mixed in. No ethanol nose to spoil it.  Enjoy its easy drinking quality on a campfire night and save your single barrel stuff for another time."
