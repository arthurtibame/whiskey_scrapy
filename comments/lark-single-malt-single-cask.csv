4.0,I just tried this dram yesterday and I think it's taste it's similar to the Highland malt Scotch. It's fruity and rich bodied. Nice spice and woody. Finish short and dry. It's worth to keep a bottle if you willing to spend $150 for it.

4.0,"In the Glass: Light gold.

On the Nose:  Wood spice. A sweet brown sugar note with a ""breakfast-like"" quality. Not quite maple syrup, but you can see it from there. Dried fruit. 
I haven't ever come across a whisky quite like this, actually. I don't have anything that I can readily compare it to (in a very good way). 

Taste:  Whatever casks these guys are using, they are really doing a fantastic job. There's no age statement on the bottle, but it doesn't taste terribly young. The spirit and the wood arrive hand-in-hand quite slowly, but then turn towards a prolonged, full development.
More of that wood spice, leading to a drying finish. Lingering cinnamon and dried fruit notes. 

Great stuff!  Well worth the $25 for the 200ml bottle that I picked up.  Hopefully Tasmanian sprits become more common and more affordable here in the States."
