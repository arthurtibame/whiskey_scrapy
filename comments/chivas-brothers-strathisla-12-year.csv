5.0,Really tasty! I enjoy it more on the rocks.
4.0,"Strong component of malt and cereals on the nose, accompanied by honey, peach in syrup, raisins, nutmeg, cinnamon, candied orange. Slight presence of wood in the background. Sherried notes rather common but enjoyable.
The mouth is warm and spicy, with hazelnuts, citrus fruits, honey and butter biscuits. Pepper. Little evolution or complexity, simple and direct.
Fairly short finish, nutmeg, pepper, orange peel.
A whisky without frills, which offers a disengaged but pleasant drink, perfect for sharing.
Even without having tried it, I think that the new version with the lowest grade has only to lose in comparison."
