4.25,Hibiki blenders choice lives up to its expectations but the prices are just no longer practical. The masters select was priced better and I personally preferred it as well.

4.5,"Wood on the nose and on the tongue, deep and Rich flavor. Spreads super nicely, tons of fruit at the beginning. Berries. Super fruity and light wood, no burn at all. Tastes like a creamy berry whiskey."

Finish: a bit spicy"
5.0,"A friend got me this bottle in japan and this is lovely with dark tasting notes like berries, cherries, cherrywood, floral, toffee, dark chocolate, and white chocolate with bright raspberries and lychee on the palate. This may be more of a 12 replacement than a 17 replacement as this is aged 12-30 years like the old 12 but an average age of 15 here would discourage calling this 12 years old. Better than 12, not sure if better than 17 as this I’ll need to taste side by side to truly find out"
5.0,Really beautiful expression of Japanese blending. Much better than Harmony.
