3.0,"[8/2/15] Another grab at the store in Orlando, a hot summer night seemed perfect to break this one out. Nose is barrel sweet and soft pepper. First sip indicates the soft pepper was deceiving. Drank straight this is very spicy pepper. The barrel sweetness helps balance this out. The aftertaste has a hint of bitter but I can't tell the origin. Will trust the experts that it is mint, definitely something green and floral. A touch of caramel and charcoal in there somewhere. 

I expected to be wowed, this is more a high 80s whiskey for me than a 90, but definitely one of my favorite ryes."
3.0,"I tried this on the rocks, very smooth and the flavor profile was open and inviting. There is a big bold rye and spice flavor that smooths out to a bitter finish. I can't say that this would be my absolute favorite Beam product, but it is definitely worth the bottle."

4.0,Bold nose heavy on the caramel. The first thing to hit the pallet is spicy toasted grain the finish is crisp. I think I'll have another dram or three.
3.0,"Smooth, very spicy, red hots, cinnamon, butterscotch, buttered toast, vanilla, grain on the medium finish. Water brings out the grain notes and tones down the heat.  Well done!"

4.0,"Just good from start to finish. Only my 2nd Rye but this one is very good. Nice balance of flavors with caramel, some burn will give more after sipping again. At $17.99 great buy
Further tasting revealed nuts and baking spices on the nose. The palate revealed more of that rye spice of red hots and finish with the burn the same and just a hint of licorice"

4.0,Just the right amount of spice. Vanilla and chocolate are also in there. Decent lingering burn at the end.

4.0,"Nose - Herbal vanilla, hint of sweet cherries, sweet mint, sharp artificial sweetness like corn syrup.
Taste - Brown sugar simple, vanilla, light bitter oakiness that is kind of like a stone fruit pit mixed with the herbal nature of older mint stems.
Finish - Lingering corn syrup like sweetness, light cinnamon burn, light fruity stone fruit pit/mint stem bitterness.
Score - 84/100
Final Thoughts - This has a very nice nose in that it's sweet & fruity and shows great promise. Once you take a sip, you still get this sweet & fruity nature, but then this light bitterness comes into play that is a little disappointing. It finishes just like the taste with a mix of nice sweet/fruity/sweet mint, but the oaky bitterness is a bit unpleasant, but tolerable. This makes a fantastic mixer for both old fashioneds as well as manhattans and isn't too bad neat either, but I think I prefer this as a mixer as it hides the bitterness a bit better."

3.0,"Did I just step into a bakery?  And by bakery, I mean a real, bread bakery, not a pastry bakery.  The nose of this rye smells like multi-grain bread, with a dollop of flaxseed and oats.  The background is a little dash of sweet butterscotch and honey.  The first sip is watery, but perhaps that's the aftereffect of following a 2 oz pour of the more robust Russell's Reserve.  The taste also has some bread-like characteristics and is a little medicinal.  The palate is the weak suit of this whiskey, because there really is not much there.  The finish is medium length, still bready, a little tart, and very spicy -- as if all that rye spice pops up in the finish.  It's very smooth, and at $20 a bottle, a pretty strong value play, which probably could be a good cocktail mixer because of that nice finish (and in a cocktail, its thin body will be bolstered by the other ingredients).  The empty glass has an aroma of caramel and vanilla, as if it was a bourbon rather than a rye, which is unexpected.  I wonder why those flavors didn't show up to the party earlier!"

4.0,"The caveat here is that I've always thought Beam's ryes were the real stars of the line-up, with just enough spice and herb to play well with that funky yeast. I genuinely *like* Old Overholt, for example. And Beam Rye is basically Overholt at a higher proof and with just a whisper more age. Smell is herbal, vanilla, a bit of paint thinner, nutty, caramel, slightly medicinal, vegetal. Taste is sweet, herbal (caraway, clove, cinnamon), light bitter citrus, maple syrup, vanilla, chalk. The finish is where the nutty Beam yeast asserts itself. Short, drying, with a bit of a bitter dry wood tang. Not necessarily a sipper, but for the price, I'm on-board."

2.0,"Oooh. Interesting. Is this what a Rye tastes like? This is my first one. Can’t say I like it. I know now what “spicy” feels like. 
Aroma: Smells like honey, vanilla, brown sugar, chocolate. Spice rides through entire drink. Biting, thin spice pops up immediately and doesn’t go away. Very simple. Nothing happens at the end. Very thin. But I sipped it with 2/3 coke and it was real nice."
3.0,"Aroma starts sweet, almost sweet tea-ish with baking spices like cinnamon and allspice, then morphs into rye bread and a little cherry. There’s something underlying in the aroma and a bit in the taste. Toast? Malt? I can’t quite place it. The flavor has plenty of rye spiciness, followed by a sugary sweetness. It finishes smooth and sweet with vanilla and a hint of cinnamon. Very enjoyable and very affordable!"

3.25,"Clear butterscotch color there is a woodsy and berry sweetness on the nose. There is a moderate body, licorice and caramel leading to clove and some peppery spice to let you know this is a rye whiskey. This is a good value rye whiskey from Jim Beam, remember this is not a Rittenhouse rye but it is a good rye whiskey nonetheless, and much easier to find."

3.0,"Nose: The nose greets you with black licorice candy, specifically the Good and Plenty candies my grandma had on her desk at work that she would always give me when I was little. The nose also has a heavy whiff of leather, like a fresh leather jacket. Other notes follow like pine, cinnamon, orange zest and peach.

Taste: The palate begins for me with a tingling spiciness shifting into a citrusy tang. Though it isn't sweet per se, I am reminded of the Pixie Stix powdered candy, which is fun; I'm realizing this is a rye that brings back nostalgic memories for me. 

Opinion: From what I understand rye had (more so in the past, not so much lately) been given flack about being an inferior whiskey. But I am very much surprised by how much I enjoyed this rye! I think it's good neat and I'm sure it would make a great backbone for some classic cocktails. And, being as it's in the Beam family it is easily accessible and affordable too! I picked mine at a local liquor store for $18.00. I think if you're new to rye, this is a good place to start! Well done Jim Beam! Sláinte!"

2.25,"It's budget week, so let's review this entry-level bottling from Jim Beam. The nose is fairly tame for a rye, in fact it appears more like a rye-heavy bourbon. Intense sweetness, cinnamon and furniture polish mash up with fresh oak, orange jam and hints of licorice. Simple but pleasant, I would say. Almost like the gates of hell opening, the palate is hot, burning and merciless. Turpentine, fermented apples and a clash of sweet and spicy notes lead into a woody and thankfully short finish. Probably a suitable bottle for Manhattan cocktails, but not the Glencairn.

3.25,Solid for a rye from a big producer.  Subtle rye throughout with spices and a bit of butterscotch thrown in.  Pleasant but not overly distinctive. George Dickel wins over this.  This rye does have a lingering afterburn for those winter nights.
4.0,"Nose: Barrel and spice, along with some dark brown sugar.  Thyme, basil, dill.  Nutmeg with a small dash of cinnamon.  Maybe a little coriander seed.  Fennel.  It's got some of that classic Beam dusty quality which actually works quite well here.  Carrot cake with cream cheese frosting pops to mind.  There's some vanilla and berry sweetness, but the classic rye spice is the star of the show.

Palate: Barrel and tannin, char, the vanilla sweetness has come forward some, but there's plenty of spices coming through.  Nutmeg, cinnamon, along with rosemary and thyme.  Stonefruit crisp - think peach or apricot.  Anise, toasted peppercorns.  Mouthfeel is medium-light, though relatively oily.  Finish starts with a nice pop of ethanol, solid tannin character, and a growing dill/anise/nutmeg thing.  The heat subsides and those baking spices move forward, and then the oak shows up.  Everything just sort of slowly fades away to wrap things up.  Medium-long finish.  Not the most complex, but well executed.

Other notes: I don't know how I haven't tried this until now.  For what it is, it's pretty well executed.  If you're not the type that likes really intense, challenging rye, this might not appeal to you.  But it is a solid entryway into the style and one that I'll definitely seek out again."

Already being familiar with and enjoying the classic Jim Beam white label, I decided to grab this bottle as per The Whiskey Vault's observation that this is something of a 'rye gateway' & 'rye forward bourbon'.

Typical Beam notes, but turned up a notch via the higher proof, followed by what I would describe as a pleasant rising tingly finish that lingers for just the right amount of time. 

Not much more to say about this one, very happy with my purchase given the enjoyable 'intro to rye' experience and value of the bottle."
