4.0,"Caramel candy, buttered popcorn and oak touch the nose. Vanilla and spice make a late but welcome entrance. Young corn and spice on the tongue. Vanilla and maple with a touch of chocolate and brine. For being so young, the corn isn’t as forward as one might expect. A finish of coffee lingers. As it breathes, grass and mint make a late appearance."

3.25,"Opened 6/19

Even though they blend their young bourbon with more mature barrels from other distilleries you can tell it is large percentage of the blend. Overall it is a descent pour but I won’t be rushing out to get the brands other offerings."
3.5,"In agreement with the provided tasting notes. This is good, and potentially VERY good, but more time in the barrel definitely won’t hurt. 

But don’t take my word for it, open one up and find out for yourself."

3.25,breckenridge bourbon august 2019 w jana at olde lagoon saloon. Vanilla sweet butterscotch. nose. But very bland no punch. Grass? Not citricy. Little spicy. Surpisngly no flavor or punch.

3.75,"Honey, vanilla, frosting, caramel, cinnamon"
3.0,"Neat from a Glencairn glass

Not a whole lot going on in the nose. Ethanol, vanilla and cinnamon. 

Slight burn on the palate with more vanilla and a slight fruity hit, maybe strawberry. 

Finish is quick and to the point, more vanilla and hint of oak. Smooth throughout though. 

My wife bought this for me and I was very skeptical. Given some more time in the barrel and higher proof, I think this could be a solid pour. But for the price, there’s much better stuff out there."

3.25,"Nose: Sweet, dusty corn.  Oak and char.  Mint, thyme, lemon oil - there's a green, vegetal thing going on that's hard to put my finger on.  Bananas and strawberries.  Red bell peppers maybe?  Fresh, warm rye bread.  Icing.

Palate: Sweet, dusty corn, barrel, dusty leatherbound books.  Honey, oranges, toasted grains.  A little floral.  Tannic.  Medium-light mouthfeel.  Finish starts with a surge of tannin texture, but the dusty corn and barrel stick around, along with honeysuckle.  The oak and corn stick around, mint fades in and out, and then eventually you have very mid-palate focused flavors.  Finish is medium short.

Other notes: A good example of potential.  I want this to be more on all fronts - more body, denser flavors, heavier mouthfeel.  It's not bad, mind, just not the big, punchy, complex flavors bourbon can aspire to these days.  That being said, this would appeal to somebody looking to step up from their usual Jim Beam white label and find their gateway into the rest of bourbon."
4.0,"Pleasant spice, cinnamon, vanilla, caramel, sweet throughout, thin mouthfeel with a short slight spice finish."
2.0,"Nose of sweet butter and bread. Basic brown sugar flavor. Flat finish. Not bad, but nothing special. Definitely not worth a premium over $25 bourbons."
3.25,Nothing too special here. Not a bad sipping whiskey but you can definitely spend a fraction of the money and get a bottle of buffalo trace or Evan Williams.
