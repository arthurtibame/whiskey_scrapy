5.0,"Columbia's most popular drink. Not bad at all. First impresion might be not so good ,but take time. It has the most deep taste for a blended brand. I think it is how a person who don't know were Scotland is can get a taste of malt. Funny taste but has a character."

3.0,"Simplesmente perfeito! Aroma ricamente frutado com notas de caramelo e laranja. O álcool não é evidente. Paladar adocicado com frutas, principalmente caramelo e baunilha. O malte está presente com um leve toque apimentado e sutilmente defumado. Com água o sabor adocicado torna-se mais pronunciado e o blend fica suavizado. Retrogosto longo com final amadeirado e sutilmente defumado."

2.0,"Actually, a really nice blend. Honey, lightly peat, heather.. Smooth. Tasted better on second try out of the bottle. I also noticed that it was the very last bottle of it on the shelf :) For a blend, I would purchase again. Gotta love the little brown pirate looking bottle too, lol!"

3.0,"Nose: Honey, nutty and mild mixed dried fruit aromas against a sherry backdrop. There is a little spiciness and after resting for a while a very pleasant oak note emerges accompanied by the faintest touch of smoke (or maybe it’s just barrel char).

Palate: A semi-sweet honey and fruit arrival that develops into nutty and milk chocolate flavours. There is also some malted cereal and a pleasant oak note as it unfolds.

Finish: Medium/short. Soft and relaxed, vanilla, caramel and a little spice in the aftertaste but no bitterness.

I was impressed with this blend right from the start. There is a light touch to the presentation and even a hint of better than average oak. It has a full but fresh character and avoids the pitfall of trying to be too rich.

It’s a rather old-fashioned style of blend that is designed for easy drinking but delivers just enough complexity and depth to be satisfying. There’s nothing challenging about it, but neither is it bland or dull - in fact it has excellent balance.
It also repays being given a chance to rest in the glass and some very nice old oak notes become apparent over time. Don’t hurry this whisky or just use it as a mixer – it’s very good as a sipping blend.

The only downside is the price, which puts it in competition with several superior blends and more than a few very good single malts.  If it cost half the price it would be my go-to everyday scotch blend.

“Above Average” : 3 stars"
4.0,Lovely surprise for a 12 year. Mature nutty rich finish with a subtle sweetness. I enjoyed this blended scotch after a good Argentinian steak. Smooth and memorable.

null,"I started drinking old parr back in 2008, always drank it on the rocks, never really had the chance to sip and enjoy it,  until just now. Nose: a little smoky-peated, sweet with  a boquet of fruits on the front, very smooth. Palate: sweet  a little spicy and peated,  definitely has some islay influenced . Finish: metallic flavor in it like copper or iron after taste a little short. Very easy to drink"

4.0,"This is one of the coolest and most unique bottles out there -- in fact, it looks more like a tequila bottle than a scotch one.  It calls to mind a turtle shell, a coconut or cantaloupe, or even a grenade.  I have no idea who came up with it, but I appreciate that it's easy to recognize even on a distant bar shelf.
  
  To its credit, there is no noticeable grain alcohol note on the nose, which is not always easy for a blend to pull off given that grain scotches tend to have that young spirit smell for longer than malt scotches.  The nose has an almost inky quality, and screams Speyside:  apple, sherry or Cabernet Sauvignon dark fruits, malt, hazelnut or chestnut, some balsamic vinegar, and spice.
  
  At first sip, this scotch is quite sweet, and the sherry emerges as candied fruit and raisins, almost chewy in texture despite only being 40%.  The cereal sweetness adds a slight variation to that theme.  That nuttiness remains noticeable, although it's a little more almond-like on the palate, and there's some spice in the mix as well.  It's a classic sherried scotch profile, and smooth as butter.
  
  I get a medium-length finish with a touch of bitterness, a hint of smoke (although not a peaty smoke), and a lingering tart sweetness.  It's not too unique, but it's good work on the part of the blenders.  Honestly, if I didn't know it was a blend, I'd just assume it was from one of the standard sherry-aging Speyside distilleries.

If this were a single malt and I'd paid $60 for it, it would be a 3-star review on this site.  But in fact it's an inexpensive blend in the $35-40 range.  Considering the value one gets, and in the holiday spirit, I'll round this guy up to 4 stars here.  It'd be an 85-88 in my book by Distiller's rating system.
  
  Random note -- doesn't the name GOP render this a tailor-made gift for the conservatives in your life?"

3.25,"My brother-in-law from Colombia introduced me to this scotch. It's very drinkable. A little peat and smoke, but just kind of bland. Old Parr just isn't up to the Parr of other scotches you can get for around $22-$30. For a tad bit more I'd go for the Dewars 12 in a blended Scotch. Nothing remarkable about it, but you can tell it's aged. Better than the Highland's Mist I buy for my wife's Rob Roys."

2.5,"This was a ""I'm at a terrible liquor store but dont want to leave empty handed"" scenario purchase. I paid $31usd or so.

The name apparently evokes a sense of the spirits pedigree as Mr. Parr is alleged to have lived a very long time. Classy marketing. 

The nose is kinda basic. Some tang in there gives you a heads up it's not terrible at the minimum. Behind the hint of peat is a bit of some star anise/cinnamon type sweet musk.

Palate you get this creamy tea and burnt pine log vibe that tastes about as good as it sounds. Do you like campfires and breakfast tea with milk and honey? The peat here is present to the end (barely) but just faint enough to marry the whole mess not much else. If you could somehow make honey waffle candy out of seaweed it would taste like grand old parr.

Mouth isnt too hot at all (you honestly get more in the nose, where it sill wasnt pronounced); the age and wood were put to use well. Knowing how not all 12 years are created equal I personally gave it a point or two here in my personal book. Room temp neat and it slides down very agreeably. 



Will I probably buy another bottle? No. But:
The bottle was cool and definitely a keeper for that alone. After work on the couch nice little cheap sip sip sipper type ordeal."

4.25,"First, Grand Old Parr is named for Thomas Parr, a semi-legendary Englishman reputed to have lived for 152 years, from the late 15th to the mid-17th Centuries. Quite the tale! Pouring neat, this a copper/amber in the glass. The nose is mellow and rich with musty oak, plus a generous helping of malty cereal, with notes of dried hay; and, a little candied dried fruit. It’s rich and malty sweet on the tongue, with some toffee and dried fruit flavoring, and a dash of spice. The finish is a long, lingering one, but only slightly warm and slightly peppery. There is a good whiff of peat throughout: less than Johnnie Black or Teacher's, but more than Dewar's 12 or Antiquary 12. The brown bottle is a little unusual, perhaps making it more interesting for some folks for Christmas gifting."
3.25,"Cragganmore at the core. A good balanced blend, sweet with a little bit of smoke. Good to slowly sip and down a bottle without rushing it or expecting some remarkable whisky. Dependable."
