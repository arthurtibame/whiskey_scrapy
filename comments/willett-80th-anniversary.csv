4.0,"Purchased for $45.99 at BevMo.
 For this price it's a fair value. Its a smooth pour for a 4 yr old BIB. Sweet Corn upfront with a nice spice kick on the mid pallette and a medium finish with soft oak, clove, vanilla and baking spices. Minimal burn and quite smooth for 100 proof.
My primary crticism would be the finish isn't long enough for my taste. You are left wanting more! 
As a side note, this bourbon is definitely not worth the $300+ price tag on the secondary market. If you can find it it for $60 or less it's an instant buy. Otherwise, there are better bourbon's out there."

4.75,"Nose- Heavy oak, sawdust, black licorice, black pepper, caramel

Taste- Toasted oak, black licorice, creme brulee, burnt orange

Finish- long spicy finish with deep oak undertones

This is fantastic. Big, bold and in your face. The oak is tasty and perfectly balanced with the other smells and flavors. Tastes like a highly aged bourbon. I also get some unique flavors from this one that’s hard to find in other drams."

4.25,"Really, really good bourbon. A medium to heavy sweetness on the palate that simply wasn't there on the nose. Full flavors of nutmeg and vanilla mid-palate. Heat builds up as it come down the back of the throat. That heat lingers for a short while until it simply can't go anymore. The one problem I had with this was that it didn't leave much of an impression after it was swallowed. I felt the lingering could've lasted longer. Otherwise, I really liked it."

3.5,"Smooth, but not very complex"
4.5,"Light in color, very aromatic, boozy, long finish."
3.5,if the finish wasn't so quick & dry this would be a much better rated release.

3.5,"Had this bottle for about a year and figured I would go back to it tonight to see what impact the air would have in this dram. As a bit of background, this was an extremely limited release from Willett. It was the first wide(ish) release of their own Distillate. It's a BIB product with an average age if 5 years. The MSRP was $39.99, however, it's going for between $300-$400 right now. I was able to snag 2 bottles for $74.99. 
In short, the extra air had minimal impact. Upon entry it's all classic notes of candy corn, vanilla and butterscotch. Mid pallette features a spice swell that keeps in balance with some oak, cinnamon and a hint of tobacco. 
It's a nice dram, and for the price a paid a very fair value. However, there is nothing special about this dram. Unlike say the Weller 12 which is legitimately punching way above it's weight, this one is priced right at the $39.99 MSRP. 
In short, even the hardcore Willett fans would be disappointed paying the current market value. I am happy to have it in my collection and I will keep the sealed bottle for a while as I am sure it will become a true unicorn. Cheers all!"
