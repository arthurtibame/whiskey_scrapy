3.75,Tastes like Jack Daniel's rye.
1.75,"It's a very low end Rye, not to my liking.  Has a strong alcohol taste, but not much flavor or complexity other than that..."
2.0,"Nose- Astrjngent with notes of syrupy sweetness like molasses. 
Body- Molasses and wet cardboard continue. 
Finish- Wet paper really comes out here.

Note- This is a one trick pony (get it?), but it isn’t horrible. It’s mostly pleasant to drink and although really simple and flat, it’s okay for a rye aged for a “minimum or six months.”"
