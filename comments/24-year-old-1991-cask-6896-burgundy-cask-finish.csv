3.25,"Hmm these Benriachs really are hit and miss. 

I'm not a fan of their core range and a lot of their single cask stuff is often more miss than hit. That said when they hit they can blow you away.

This one is not one of those. It's been in oak or finished for too long. Very wooded and tannic with hint of sulphur. Not that enjoyable."
