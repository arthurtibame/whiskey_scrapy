4.5,"Scotland, September 2017. Whisky #14

Nose: Fragrantly floral pineapple and mango aromas dance over a base of caramel fudge, hazelnuts, and slight woody notes. [The dry glass presents smoke, with a slight floral honey overtone].

Palate: Gloriously rich and full, red berries, vanilla, brine, dark chocolate, coffee, malt, creme brûlée with honeycomb crusting.

Finish: Long, with sweet spicy notes, pepper and salt.

As pleasant as the nose is when neat the high ABV locks the aromas down tightly so adding a generous dash of water and giving it time to sit and open up is highly recommended.

Similarly, the palate gains complexity from watering - particularly the unleashing of a full and rich spicy kick into the finish and some delightfully sweet smoke. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this whisky the is the sherry influence, which flits masterfully between dry and sweet. I suspect that this is the key to its whole character.

This is a fine whisky that deserves and repays time and attention. Try it in different dilutions and give yourself plenty of space to appreciate the facets it can present. For this beguiling complexity alone it deserves attention. A very satisfying discovery that capped off my visit to the distillery.

""Excellent"" : 4.5 stars"

4.25,"Great dram. Similar to how the Tullibardine Murray is a step up from their core range this to has the similar rich viscous vanilla, honey and creme brulee flavour going on. 4.25 from me."

3.0,"Glen Scotia Victoriana: A Pretty Bottle.

The nose was potent with acetone leading the way. While vanilla, oatmeal and caramel did make an appearance wrapped in a mildly smoky package, it wasn’t enough to save this one for me. 

The mouthfeel was light and fruity, offering some fun along the way, but I longed for other less expensive and interesting drams.

The finish was super light, initially not showing much heat. That was followed up by nice burn afterwards.

For the money, you can find dozens of more enjoyable things at equal or even at less than half the price. Sadly, this was “meh.”

4.0,"16 August 2017
Inverlochy Castle after dinner

Neat:
Nose is strongly alcohol, with a bit of complex fruit
Smooth mouthfeel
Alcoholic burn on tip of tongue
with hint of smoke
Then I checked, and ABV is 51.5%.

A small amount of water: 
Smoother, slightly less smoke, more richness

A bit more water: 
Even smoother, ample smoke

More water:
Still a bit of alcohol burn on the cheek
Ample smoke

Yet more water:
No alcohol burn
A bit of smoke"
5.0,"Terrific. Full, spicy, and smooth."
4.0,"This is quite the robust dram, holding its own very well with a few drops of water added. There is some charred oak, olive brine and hint of citrus on the nose, followed by some strawberries, roasted almonds and dark chocolate on the palate. The finish is warm, fruity and relatively long. Worth a try."
4.0,"This is really good whiskey - well put together. The nose has subtle hints of prunes and anise, with a floral quality I can't put my finger on but really enjoy. The mouthfeel is robust and full, and the palate has added notes of espresso coffee and nutmeg. The finish is long and delicious, yet dry, and a little bit of water here goes a long way. This is a better expression than the 15."

5.0,"I will say, up front, that it was a good while back that I sampled this at a tasting (along with two million other Loch Lomond, Inchmurrin, and Glen Scotia drams...it was a GREAT night). That said, I saved my notes, and this was definitely a favorite from the night - possibly best in show out of quite a spread. The nose opens with a grapey/wine quality, followed by salt, caramel, and nutty notes; the palate is super smooth for the ABV, with dried fruit, nuttiness, salted caramel, dark chocolate, and a hint of pepper. My last word in my notes: ""Long, luscious, rich, very tasty."" Well, there you have it. Maybe I need to pick up a bottle and refresh my memory as to just how great this one is..."
4.5,"No age statement but tastes mature
No metallic chemical or play dough notes

3.0,"Nose: Cotton candy and sweet candy corn, fruit punch, underlying citrus. A rest in the glass brings out non-distinct wine barrel notes.

Palate: Light, juicy fruit chewing gum, very sweet

Finish: Medium-short, smooth vanilla and sweet oak"
4.0,"Another bonus sample from the SDT. This time we head to Campbeltown and the Glen Scotia distillery. Victoriana is a NAS single malt that is taken from the distillery’s reserve warehouse. Bottled at a hefty 51.5% ABV, is non chill filtered and natural color of amber honey. 

The nose is strong and powerful. Perfumed and floral up front. Maple, sherry, mineral - seashells and gravel. Gentle earthy peat and slight smoke. Charred oranges and tangerine marmalade. The sherry and maple notes intensify with a little time. Green and red grapes, cherries, sherry infused oak, cinnamon, allspice and some raisins. The longer it sits the more the mineral notes become more prominent, but the maple/sherry always hangs around. Water brings out vanilla, caramel, toffee, some light milk chocolate notes. Dehydrated apples, a touch of cereal malt and honey. More clearly defined oranges and tangerines. Really a great nose on this baby. 

The palate is sherry forward with a bit of heat, but not really a spicy heat if that makes sense. The pepper spice shows up soon afterward, but not too bad at all. Mineral peat but little to no smoke, pretty typical of Campbeltown in my experience. Oak soaked with orange oil, allspice, a little maple but nothing compared to the nose and dark cherries. Water brings vanilla, chocolate, more oranges/tangerines. 

A medium bodied mouthfeel that is mouth coating and mouthwatering. 
The finish is medium long with sherry, oak, pepper, light oranges and cherries. 

A very good single malt...great even. It has a bit of everything. Sherry, peat, sweet, savory, earthy. With or without water it’s a great dram. One of the few Campbeltown whiskies I’ve truly enjoyed. Thanks to @Telex for the sample. 4.25
Cheers"
4.0,Vanilla nose. Suuuuuuper smooth rolling into the tongue. Very little spice. Fruit flavor with heavy doses of vanilla.
4.0,"Campbeltown has, for me, become the new Islay.  I think there’s more things going right than wrong there.  Sure, you get an occasional bad pour, but in general, the Springbanks and it’s brethren puts out pretty good ones at a price that doesn’t involve selling your organs ( hey Macallan...that’s meant for you).  I really liked this one, courtesy of my Kardashian wanna-be internet celeb @Telex, as part of the final trading round.  Brine, wet tarry rope...palette is similar, but a bit of green forest floor added for good measure.  Thanks Jason for the sample!"
5.0,"It is a rare thing for a distillery to sell a no-age statement whisky for $100 or more, but it's also rare to find a distillery putting out a real connoisseur's whisky with a meaty ABV and no chill filtration.  Victoriana might not have an age statement, but it doesn't lack for anything else.  This may be the best lightly peated single malt that I've tasted, although to be honest, I'm not even sure that it's peated.  It may just be some old sherry butts giving it a smoky edge.  The nose showcases forest floor, oak, salted toffee and honeyed oats.  On the palate, I get some apricot but also tobacco, with a creamy, lightly sweet texture.  The finish also has some cream to it, along with that wisp of smoke that makes me suspect this is lightly peated.  I really like the fact that this whisky walks a delicate tightrope between savory or bitter flavors and sweet ones, and makes it all the way across to safety."

4.0,"This is great but it needs time in the bottle and in the glass to air out. 

The nose is sweet and spicy with a hint of smoke. I smell marshmallow, maple candy, cinnamon and nutmeg. 

On the palate is peach, dried cranberries, pistachios, toasted cinnamon buns, and day old charcoal. As it sits in the glass, I taste more caramel and nougat.

The finish is long and leaves the taste of malt and salted caramel lingering on the tongue.

Tasty stuff!"

Clear medium gold.
Small tulip.
Medium old furniture, old leather, dried spicy, and a little dried nuts in nose.
Dry, medium full body with tiny smoke biscuits, leather, and gram masala in palate.
Ok balance, easy strong hot finish.
Typical scotch right at the original of spectrum."

3.5,"Nose - this is by far one of the most bourobn like scotches I've ever had.  I'm getting those caramels and vanillas from a bourbon.  I get a bit more of a pie and some candy and maybe even some maple syrup.  A hint of milk chocolate.  

Taste - On the pallet I get some fruity notes, some kind of candy, caramel, maple, oh this is a lot of candy.  

I'm loving this stuff, I wonder if these are oak barrels that they just char, I've never heard of a scotch distillery doing that but there's so much bourbon like character here, but a bit more fruity and just different.  

Going 3.5, this is an easy buy for most people.  I ordered this online and it was a bit over 100 bucks.  I feel like this is a profile that will be very inviting to scotch and bourbon drinkers.  I'm all over the map on where i want to score this, a part of me wants to go 3.0 as it lacks wow moments beyond being unique but another part of me wants to go 4 stars because of how inviting this will be."

3.5,"Very strong and powerful nose shows a high ABV though sweet, like marshmallows. Very Very light vanilla, seems slightly smoky.
First taste confirms the first smell this is a strong malt.
The oily is mixed with salty notes which let a mighty presence on the tongue even if the whisky doesn't have a very full body. Citrus fruits seen to be the origin of the marshmallow smells even if we were expecting more red fruits like grenadine.
All other taste remind the classics malted barley, oak and vanilla.
A wee bit fidgy at the nose and on the palate."

3.75,"Another crazy week.  A few days in Tampa, flight delays (and then again not...), a whisky tasting midweek, work and more work and now some down time with a bonus sample from @Telex for the tasting group.

A pale amber color similar to watered down apple juice. 

A soft vanilla-confectionary sugar sweetness blended with a mineral quality like the interior side of clam or oyster shells.  Orchard fruits dipped in orange marmalade sprinkled with nutmeg and clove.  Some sulphur notes  gives a slight funk to the overall nose.  Odd nose yet sweet and inviting. 

A spicy sweetness starts the palate.  First sweet which fades rather quick and becomes spicy, crescendoing.  Vanilla, caramel and honey sweet; cinnamon and white pepper spice.  Apples, pears and apricots provide, obviously, the fruity side and the sherry influence all reveal itself in due time and towards the finish.  All these flavors are packaged in a medium-light body. 

A slightly dry wooden finish with some orange bitterness and cinnamon.  A warming sensation deep down is ultimately provided and lasts and lingers for a good length. 

Initially, this came across quite ordinary.  The nose sweet and funky made it difficult to pin down; intriguing or off putting?  The palate sweet, spicy and fruity not clearly defined.  However, time is the stabilizer.  With time, the nose becomes softer, the palate better balanced with a weighted sweetness.  It becomes a fine dram; slightly complex with an easy spicy sweetness.  [88/100][Tasted: 3/8/19]"

4.25,"A: Light Gold
N: Delightful. Sweet Vanilla
P: Spicy, powerful but very elegant, oak is present. Strong vanilla. 
F: Long spiced finish, late char left on the tongue and cheeks."
4.0,A good cask strength whisky. Has a fairly noticable toffee undertone.
4.0,"Nose: not aggressive whatsoever for a cask strength. Initially honey clusters and light cream appear.  Light citrus rind, grapefruit perhaps, and floral notes follow with a rich pudding chomeur aroma of toffee and syrup. An inherent smoke lingers throughout with scents from the oak cask. Addition of water introduces subtle strawberry and raspberry notes.

Palate: The cask strength appears more prominently on the taste, but it subsides with immediate sweetness. Strong notes of vanilla and banana pudding with an oily texture. Brininess sets in with the ever-lingering smoke from the charred oak cask. Caramel is found from beginning to end with brief, light floral notes.

Finish: Salty and smoky finish, the sweetness almost completely subsides offering a medium and dry finish."

4.0,"Here’s another bonus sample from the distillery tour:  Campbeltown’s Glen Scotia.  This is a tasty, NAS called Victoriana.  It was sent by my friend Jason, aka @Telex.  It’s 51.5% ABV and is shiny gold with runny, thin legs.

The nose is rich caramel and light smoke.  There’s a lovely maple syrup note holding the nose up, along with juicy fruit gum flavors and hints of heat from the ABV.  The palate is more maple and caramel, with youthful spirit and faint smoke.  It’s constantly warming on the tongue with some sherry presence lingering into the finish.  Speaking of finish- it’s long with a constant, mellow and warm malt note.  Smooth, melted toffee squares dry and attach to the tongue and roof of your mouth.  It’s a fantastic finish- maybe the best part of the dram IMO.

I really enjoyed this one.  There’s not much complexity, but the toffee and warming aspects really make it feel luxurious and dessert-like.  It’s a solid 4-4.25 stars.  Thanks again, Jason.  I really liked this one."

Very fresh and crisp, like apple juice and cucumber water. Really smooth for 103 proof and very sweet."
3.75,Im enjoying this one.
3.75,"Aroma of caramel or caramel corn, vanilla, maybe a little brown sugar. Sweet but a bit hot on the palette due to the high ABV. A little briny in the finish, with a hint of smoke. 3 cl sample from the 12 Drams of Christmas Premium (2019 Edition)."
2.75,"Nose is ok, not too strong. Mouth is also just  ok. One dimensional flavor, tastes young. After taste is middle of the road. Not too long or short. Pretty smooth for 51%. Nothing jumps out as noticable or exceptional. Smokey and clean are the two descriptors that come to mind."
