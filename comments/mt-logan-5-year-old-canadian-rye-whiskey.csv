3.25,Easy sipping Canadian whiskey typical highwood notes compared to the 21 centennial it’s harsher but more forwardly flavourful with a skittle more spice and kick to it thought it was higher than 40% when I had my first sip worth trying but with the prices so close I’d rather get my hands on the 15 or 20 year if I can find it as at $34 cad I think there is better on the market Bearface for example even Gibson’s 12 or lot 40 would lol give this a run at that price now if it was $25 we would be having a different discussion :)
