4.0,"A sherry monster for sure!
  
  Nose: Stale Oak, Vanilla, Cinnamon and Sulfur, water opens it up and releases some fruity notes like raisin and dried orange peel.
  
  Taste: Sherry, Black cherries, Vanilla, Citrus peel, Maple syrup, Ginger.
  
  Finish: More Berries, Burnt Sugar, Spices, long, but not very evolving.
  
  I can see why many rate the 15 higher but I think it’s splitting hairs. A decent alternative to Macallan 18. Sweeter and spicier with more berry notes than the dried fruits notes of the Mac 18. Not as outrageously priced either."

4.5,"I really love this whisky. I much prefer the viscosity/ oiliness of a Glendronach over thinner spirits such as Glenfarclas. Also the toffee flavour of Olorosso cask influence vs the much sweeter PX. This was one of the 18 yr bottles that contained much older stock so it'll be interesting to see how the next bottle I buy turns out

Ok update a 3 years later and a new bottle...one of the last from Billy Walker. Has it held it's own against time and my evolving palette? The answer is a firm yes. Now a 4.75 is a bit high on my current rating scale it's more a 4.25 on an off day (for my palate) and 4.5 on a good one. This dram on a clean palate may initially be a bit reticent and not fully come into it's own but man does it do well as a final night cap. Given this is a recently opened bottle I know it'll mellow, evolve and shine further in it's lifetime on my shelf. 

Update. Yeah back to 4.5 to 4.75 territory already. There really isn't anything like it.

Update 2: Well yes there is it appears. In a later match up between this, the original 15 Revival and the new the old 15 yr was a winner 4.75. This and the new 15 pretty close."

$17/dram in house

Founded in 1826 the GlenDronach distillery is one of the oldest registered distilleries in Scotland.
This offering paying homage to the founder James Allerdice has been 100% matured in Spanish Olorosso Sherry casks. This also celebrates the distillery’s tradition of Olorosso Sherry maturation - though more and more since 2002 - Bourbon casks are starting to be used more often at the distillery"

5.0,"It's a chilly, rainy night here in Virginia so I figured it's a great time to get into some single malts.  I opened this bottle several weeks ago on my trip to visit family in WV.  I took a few sips but didn't really sit down and analyze things.  I might as well put it through its paces tonight.  The GlenDronach 18 Allardice.  This malt comes in at 46% ABV, has no color added and isn't chill filtered.  This particular batch was named after Glendronach's founder James Allardes.

It's a deep mahogany color and makes some silky legs in the taster.  The nose is very sweet:  caramel and vanilla along with some dark fruits like plums and raisins.  The first full Oloroso sherry casks are also very present.  It smells great.

The palate is all GlenDronach spice:  ginger, spice cake and orange peel.  There's a bit of a nutty, oily flavor present as well.  It's fantastic.  I really love GlenDronach and this one takes that to the next level.  It's ridiculously smooth.

The finish is all spice.  Those dark fruits and that spice cake hang around awhile and really coat the tongue through the entire sip.  The ABV is well hidden and those 18 long years in the sherry casks have made a wonderfully smooth whisky.

This is one of my favorite single malts of all time.  It's deliciously sweet with that signature GlenDronach spice profile.  The price point is on the higher side as I believe I paid close to $180 but this is a bottle I'd love to have on hand all the time.  Great, great juice.  4.75 stars.  Cheers."

3.0,"I'm not one for heavy sherry aging but it seems unfair to swear them off without trying a good smattering of examples. 

The nose is quite luxurious. Makes me feel like buying a smoking jacket. There's dried figs, leather shoes, sultanas, almonds, and dried currants. The palate leans a little too heavy on the sherry but there is some dark malt and serious spice amongst all that fruit. The heat from the alcohol clouds the finish so all that gets through is the persistent fruit. I'd rather just buy a bottle of sherry than buy whisky that tastes like it. Though  I wager dabbing this behind my ears would make me seem a little more dashing."
5.0,"On the nose:  fresh brownies, cinnamon, nutmeg, coffee, spice.
    On the palate: milk chocolate, barley, viscous, full mouth feel, not too sweet on the finish. Distilled in 1995 Bottled in 2016 aged 21 years but still not as complex and long lasting as the parliament 21 yr old. Paid only 160."

4.0,"I have had a sample of this whisky sitting on my shelf for I don't know how long, Generously provided by my friend Lee.  Now that I am between rounds of our trading group I have the time to finally enjoy it. 

Glendronach is a Highland distillery known for its spicy profile and high level of quality. Bottled at 46% ABV, non chill filtered and natural color of a tawny copper. Matured in first fill Oloroso sherry casks. 

The nose is full and intense sherry. Figs/dates, raisins and plums, a real sherry bomb. Caramel and light vanilla. Semi sweet chocolate and fresh coffee notes. Quite mature, but definitely on the sweeter side from those first fill Oloroso casks. Blood oranges, brown sugar and dark cherries. Hardly any oak even after 18 long years. Faint ginger and cinnamon & sugar. Maple syrup after some time and more sherry wine notes. Lovely. 

The palate is sweet, almost too sweet but not quite, right in the ""sweet spot"" for lack of a better term. A nice spice profile, again right in the sweet spot. Not overly spicy, but just enough kick to keep your attention. Sherried fruits, mostly dates and raisins. Very light oak and ginger with some maple syrup. The casks have almost completely overtaken the spirit/distillery profile. They do a good job though. 

Medium bodied and an oily mouthfeel. Mouthwatering and smooth. 
The finish is long. Sweet and a little peppery. Mouthwatering throughout and full on sherry. 

This is really not a scotch that is meant to be dissected. It's too good. It should be enjoyed with friends (preferably those who can appreciate a fine scotch) while relaxing or celebrating. Personally I would have liked a little more of an oaky character and a hint of peat, 5-10 ppm, but it's hard to find any other faults here. For the price ($170 locally) it really is a special occasion type bottle. I would definitely buy it for that purpose though. Thanks again Lee, I really enjoyed it. 4.5
Cheers"

3.0,"The least impressive of the range, and having tried over 10 different glendronach’s, I feel it’s fair to make this statement. The nose is nice, nothing like the 15, but still juicy fruit and sherry, the palate is missing something, still decidedly Glendronach but feels like it’s becoming choked out by the oak. The finish is quite drying and leaves your tongue very dry. Pricy for what the juice is, but kudos for keeping age statements."

Taste - Pleasant warm tingle, orange peel, candied ginger, light bitter spices, bitter dark chocolate, plums/prunes, pecan nutty bitter sweet.

Finish - Lingering ginger/orange spice tingle, lingering nutty bittersweet pecans, hint of dark dried stone fruits.

Score - 85/100

Final Thoughts - This one has a fantastic nose. Sadly it was a bit of a disappointment on the palate as I got a lot more bitter notes in it than I expected based upon the nose. It was good, but I didn't expect to get so many bitter notes from all sides, whether it came from a chocolaty bitter, to a fruity bitter, to a nutty bitter. Usually a dram can have a few notes, but if it's balanced out it really really works, but in this case it became a bit distracting. Overall it's still tasty, but I think the nose is by far the best thing about it.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

5.0,"The whisky may represent my single biggest disagreement with the Distiller ratings.  84 is a crime!  This 18-year old whisky, matured entirely in oloroso sherry butts, is a spectacular example of the genre.  Vanilla is immediately noticeable, along with the complexity typical of older sherry drams:  figs, caramel, and rich, buttery sweetness that reminds me of cashews or a particularly creamy nut.  Another great thing about older sherry-aged drams is that they develop a smokiness that doesn't come from peat, but makes for a lovely finish all the same.  At $150 or so, this is an expensive bottle in the U.S., but it's a bargain compared to the $250 that Macallan 18 commands.  It's a bargain in another significant way too.  Because GlenDronach shut down entirely from 1996 to 2001, the current whiskies labeled ""18"" in fact contain whisky from right before 1996 (since none of the 2001 and later whisky is old enough yet).  That makes this, in reality, a 21-year old whisky.  Thus, this year and next may be the last change to grab this ""special"" Allardice that is in fact far more mature than its age statement suggests."

4.5,"GlenDronach is a bit of a one-trick pony, but boy, they know how to make a great sherry malt! Recent batches of the 'Allardice' are much older than 18 years, and the age shows. Heavy sherry notes, oranges and rich spices bewitch the nose, intermingled with hazelnuts, roasted coffee and subdued herbal freshness. The taste is intense, full-bodied and very much in line with the aroma, culminating in a substantial, lasting and chocolaty bitter finish. Not quite as complex as the fantastic 15-year-old Revival, but who am I to criticize this superb whisky!

Taste (w/o water): Big arrival. Dark fruits, honey, some alcohol burn, charred wood with almost peaty notes, which goes into a long mouth watering finish that is worthy a 18yo sherry whisky! The Oloroso casks really shine in the finish as it becomes very dry, in a pleasant way.

Summary: A beautiful sherry matured whisky that is worth the money and it comes with perfect ABV, as always in Glendronach.  It's a stronger expression than the 12yo but falls a little short in comparison the the 21yo, which is just stunning! However, regarding the price I would rate this 87/100."

With few drops of water and about 30 min: opens up additional vanilla notes

Score - 91/100. 

Final Thoughts - Changed radically from the immediate pour sip to the sip about 5 min later. Another 10 did open it up a slight bit more. It’s a welcome, warming dessert.  

This was a really fine dram. I’d say I’m slightly underwhelmed by the entry, but it’s made up for on the other end.

4.75,"This Whisky needs to sit for 20 mins in your glass before drinking.  

I almost hated this whisky.  Because I didn’t let it sit in my glass long enough.  It was very sharp and the taste was just “chemically” and harsh even with a splash of water.  It was a 2 star whisky at best.  

Then I read some reviews and noticed that people said they let it sit for 15 mins.  Holy crap!  What a difference.  It changed so dramatically, like nothing I’ve ever experienced before.  It’s worth all the rave reviews!

Now that I know, this whisky is one of my favorites."

Natural color


Nose: deep dark and bright fruits with baking spices in the background. Think raisin, prune and figs along with blue berry, cherry, apple and apricot. Also a hint of vanilla and whipped cream.

Taste: rich, viscous, creamy and fruity. A true sherry bomb. Dates, figs plums and chocolate-covered raisins greet you and carry the bulk of the load. Spices and juicy black cherry follow, along with a nuttiness that comes in on the development but is never center stage. 

Finish: medium. Medley of dark fruits give way to notes of vanilla, brown sugar, cinnamon spice and at the very end, dark chocolate caramel and a bite of pepper/alcohol.

Value: $145-185 USD. A steep price (especially above $150) for an 18 year old. Buy only if you have the extra cash or hunt for a cheaper bottle (they exist!).

Final thoughts: a complex powerhouse sherry scotch worthy of any shelf, the 18 Allardice is a true gem worthy of the accolades it receives. This single malt delivers on all fronts, but at its price point it puts itself on the very high end of 18 year old whiskies. With many great options coming in $30-50 dollars less, you may find yourself second guessing a purchase of the Allardice. An understandable predicament, but you will be missing out. 

Score: 4/5 (highly recommend buying a bottle.

3.5,Strong nose of maple and spice cake gives way to maple notes and dried fruit on the palate. Subtle hints of vanilla also. The finish is a bit jammy in texture which I thought takes away from this dram a bit.
5.0,"My bottle is from July of 2019. Since the distillery was mothballed in 1996 and reopened again only in 2001, there’s a chance that in 2019 this 18-year old Allardice still has some of that older whisky in it. Don’t know if it actually does, but the price of $140 at Costco certainly suggests that. 

The color is natural amber, very viscous, and likely non-chill-filtered although the bottle doesn’t state that. Nose is delicate, mature, and complex, with notes of sherry (it’s matured in Spanish Oloroso Sherry casks after all), black pepper, vanilla, oak, and caramel. Palate is sweet and round, with creamy texture, and notes of raisins, oak, vanilla, and more sherry. Finish is not very long but nice, with more sweetness of ripe fruit, and oaky-vanilla notes. So far - good, but not very impressive. 

After a few sips I start noticing subtle smokiness on the back, the kind you would typically find in older drams - that of a smoked salmon. Perhaps it does have some of that older influence in it after all - “so you’re telling me there’s chance...” A few drops of water in this 46% ABV whisky definitely opens more of its character. The palate becomes more floral and fruity, opening some apricot and dark chocolate notes. The finish also becomes longer and more balanced, and that smoked note intensifies. Much more interesting after about 20 minutes. 

In another 20-30 minutes this dram opens all of its complexity. It’s an absolute masterpiece - complex, rich, and round. Has everything you would wish for in a sherry-cask whisky. I have to admit, I was initially hesitant to say I would pay $140 for this again as I thought Kirkland’s 20-year-old 46% ABV sherry cask finish whisky from Alexander Murray was almost as good for less than half the price. After giving it some time though, I think it’s definitely worth it - probably one of the best sherry cask drams I’ve had. I can see how this didn’t get a very good rating though, you have to give it time to develop. Lovers of complex sherry cask influences - this whisky is for you, but don’t rush it"
4.75,"'Twas the dram before Christmas, when all through the house 
not a person was stirring, not even my spouse. 
The bottles were placed on the bar cart with care, 
in hopes that St. James soon would be there. 

The Glencairns were settled all snug on their shelf, 
while bottles of whisky were guarded by elves. 
And Wife in her PJ’s, and I in my slacks, 
had just settled ourselves for a light winter nightcap. 

When out on the dining room rose such a clatter, 
I sprang from my chair to see what was the matter. 
Away to the table I flew like a flash, 
tore open the cupboard, and looked at the stash. 

The moon on a bottle of new purchased booze 
gave the luster of sherry to all the things food, 
when, what to my wondering eyes should appear, 
but a blue labeled tube with 18 long years. 

With a little tin topper, so tasteful and tight,
I knew in a moment it was Allardice. 
More rapid than tariffs, his flavors they came, 
and I nosed and I tasted and called them by name: 

""Now orange! Now malt! Now, coffee and cherry ! 
On, fudgey! On, walnut! On, honey and sherry! 
To the top of the glass! To the back of the palate! 
Now drink away! Drink away! Don’t forget all about it!"" 

And then, in a stupor, I heard on my roof 
the nosing and tasting of each little hoof. 
As I pulled out my nose and was turning around, 
down the chimney St. James came with a bound. 

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, 
and filled all the bottles, then turned with a quirk. 
And laying his finger aside of his nose, 
and giving a nod, up the chimney he rose. 

I sprang to the bar, to look for a drink, 
And away they went down, just the way one might think. 
But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drank out of spite, 
""Sherry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!""


Thanks for another quality year of reviews, community, and education Distiller folks. May your glass be full this holiday season and your whisky flow freely into the glasses of those you care for. Cheers!"

4.5,"Nose - Nice fruity nose, with some slight pungency and spice.
Palette - nice mix of spiciness, fruit (apple and pear), and a hint of toasted almond.  Just a little tartness to the initial taste.
Finish - Nice long finish, more Carmel and vanilla, and slowly fading spice."
4.25,Sweeter and smoother than the 15. But not as balanced.
4.25,"Big sherry influence. Mine was bottled in 2019 and likely has a minimum of 22-23 year old stock due to the 1996-2002 closure of GlenD and it must have some even older stock, possibly much older. Age isn't everything though and some whisky does not improve past a certain point. Cask quality is super important. However this is whisky made by The Glendronach in the old way with floor maltings and slight peat kilning. They had lots of casks in storage and the legendary Billy Walker went out and bought some back and got more. They are mixing plenty of good aged spirit into this IMHO.

You really need to let it sit and rest for a little bit after pouring or you will get cheated. I recommend pouring and sip, wait 15 minutes and sip again, wait 10-15 minutes and consume. You can bide your time with badminton or  preparing a flan but I recommend what I do: Drink Talisker 10 and Distiller's editon to pass the time. You could also consume any of the Macallan 12s and lament the slow decay of the Macallan stock if that is your thing.

This whisky is extremely dark and thick and viscous. Great mouth feel and nice finish. Hold it on the tongue as long as you can and you will not be disappointed. It deserves to be consumed slowly and deliberately like a very delicate and expensive wine while you contemplate your fragile existence."

4.0,"Nose: Oak. Lots of big, earthy oloroso saturated oak. This makes the nose a little one-note to start with but over time it gains complexity as toffee, orange zest, walnuts, tobacco and heavy-roast coffee grounds emerge. Some dark dried fruit aromas lurk on the sidelines and with more time red berries and a good helping of cinnamon stewed in maple syrup comes to the front. After considerable time an almost disconcerting aroma of bay rum aftershave is noticed! [The dry-glass aroma is all dark, sweaty sherry and oak with a tiny tinge of char.]

Palate: A dry, astringently tannic arrival that hides deep sweet-and-sour cherry and dark chocolate notes. Walnut skins, rancio, dried fruit, wood resin, malt extract, orange peel. In its foundation the palate is sweet and fruity, but time and the particular casks chosen for maturation contribute considerable balancing dryness. The texture is creamy, but not outstanding.

Finish: Long. Medium/dry sherry, warm spices (maybe even peppery?), heaps of malt extract and a little molasses. The only letdown is a tinge of flinty hardness in the aftertaste from the immense tannins.

Don't judge this one quickly or on the basis of a pour from a newly-opened bottle. Give it time to open - at least 20 minutes. This is a great example of fine oloroso cask maturation paired with considerable benign sulphur in the new-make. It starts off brash but also shy and reserved, like an awkward teenager, and only gains the confidence to strike up a friendship as it relaxes.

At times the palate can seem like sucking on an old barrel stave, but it's just a flash of tannins and is soon displaced by mature sweet notes. There's a touch of over-stewed old armagnac to it.

It's a good whisky - actually it's a very good whisky - but personally I prefer the 15 year expression (either the old or the new one) or the fresh exuberance of the 12 year old. I have to confess that I'm not a fan of this style of whisky, so it's hard to be objective, and I will not bother trying to replace this bottle (which was from a 2017 batch).

""Very Good"" : 4 stars"

4.25,"Bottled 2/25/2019 (oddly they use our backwards american month day system) - so yes this might be 24 year old scotch or at least 23 and a lot of change.  Having just had a 1992 single cask, cask strength, this isn't all first fill but god it's lovely.  

Nose - berry's, figs, cherries, touch of chocolate, and a bit of nuts and some oak.  As I let it open up I'm getting some baked goods.  

Taste - Oh my, this is old whisky.  There's this feeling you get in your mouth when you have really old stuff in there.  It's the alcohol and the oak seeping into your cheeks and gums, the sweet up front but then leading to this transition where oak comes about...oh my.  Chocolate, dark fruits, a touch of spice, walnuts, oak dusty oak.  Wonderful.  

So here's where I am.  I just had, but couldn't review, a 1992 glendronach.  That's a 5 sherry bomb.  This isn't close to that.  But it's crazy good too.  160 bucks (I know you can get it way less in the UK).  Is it worth it?  Yes.  If you like sherry this is a must get.  I'm going 4.25.  It's just that good."

4.5,"Raisiny, nutty, very sherry forward on the nose.  Caramel and maybe a little powdered sugar.

On the palate, this is almost as much sherry as scotch.  Lightly sweet, a bit of spice, black pepper.

The finish is pepper and wood, with a bit of mustiness.  Caramel emerges late and the sherry raisins and nuts return.

This is one of the darkest scotches that I've had.

The sherry is strong, so it takes a while to acclimate and get to the more subtle notes that make this stand out."

Wow. Sherry BOMB. Thick and bold flavors of everything sherry, with unique funky rum on the nose and palate. One of the most complex noses i’ve ever had, with notes that go on and on. Palate is much like the nose, complex and beautiful, with tons of wood and chocolate. All in all, does not disappoint, and is absolutely a great value. My only gripe is that the wood flavors overpower it just in the slightest, but are quickly overcome."

Bottled at 46%abv, with an SPECTACULAR AND FIRST TIME SEEN, burnt umber color (this is super red). 

Lets start talking about this baby. As soon as you open the bottle, this sweet aroma starts overwhelming your nose. RED FRUITS: Strawberries and raspberry. A very elegant sherry note, chocolate bathed raisins, maple syrup and raspberry marmalade. Incredible.

On the palate: it is everything. 

Yes, everything.

It is:

Sweet.
Hot. 
Spicy.
Bitter. 
Sherried.
Slightly smoky (just a touch in the aftertaste)
UMAMI (which is an explosion of flavors or ""delicious"" in japanese) 
There are also grape and peppery notes, the finish is so long and powerful, that you must sigh to live it. Sublime.

Overall, you know it: 100 over 100. A masterpiece, a work of art.  GO BUY THIS NOW.

5.0,"Well I think the 12 yr GD is great ($60ish). The amazing 15 yr though more $ is absolutely worth it ($90ish). I paid $173 out the door(most ive spent on a bottle) for this 18y and honestly have no regrets, zero buyers remorse. While I completely understand the concept of diminishing returns this scotch is so exquisite and utterly magnificent it somehow easily justifies its pricetag. Poured neat the nose is candied fruits, crumb cake, decadent caramelized brown sugar/dark toffee with orange marmalade,refined malt and mature oak. It is very complex and adding a drop or two will awaken even more. Luscious mouthfeel leads palate of dense aged malt, thick toffee and fudge with supporting sherried fruits and sweet smooth barrel. Repeated tasting reveals hints of honeydew, macadamia and leather.  Very rich rewarding scotch if you take your time.  There is no sharpness, no spike its so restrained yet bursting with flavor at same time. Finish is forever with melted caramel, malt, faded fruits, nuts and slightly drying oak giving balance. Make no mistake this is heavenly nectar that anyone who claims to enjoy scotch should at some point try. I don't think a pour is even close to enough, buy a bottle and explore.......99/100.......best scotch ive had to date. Im sure spending more, maybe much more will surpass this but alas we come back to diminishing returns. All I know is this- This GD18 is $173 well spent........side note: 84 for a score here is a fucking joke"

4.0,"The smell is warm and welcoming, inviting to drink it when outside temperatures are colder. Cherry tart, raisins in alcohol, prunes and dried dates, candied orange, cinnamon, caramel, chocolate. Some lemon peel breaks the sweet bomb, at times a little 'excessive, along with a grassy background that fights to emerge.
It is actually quite fresh on the palate, with the alcoholic charge that pushes the spices (a touch of cloves) and pinches in the mouth, while red fruits and hazelnuts compete for the podium along with fruit tart, candied fruit and more chocolate. Less full-bodied than expected, with a bitterish base that breaks down the aromas.
The finish is quite long and astringent, of hazelnuts, prunes, cinnamon, cocoa powder. 
Only three years less than Parliament and yet so far from its balance and elegance, with the influence of the barrel that is more messy and dry and the intrusiveness of the tannins that debase the whole. Pity."

On the palate it remains as sweet as the nose promised. There is deep and fruity richness. It is the opposite of aggressive and really lets you enjoy every aspect this fine whisky has to offer. So very round and interesting. The finish especially is very nice and long. It is quite different to the palate and everything together creates a very nice composition. All I have to criticize is that it is a bid to fruit-juicy. 

After a lot of samples and tastes of sherry cask whisky I realized that - while I can enjoy them - they aren’t really my preference. But one or two bottles of fine sherry bombs should be on every shelf and this definitely is one of them."
