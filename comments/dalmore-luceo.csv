4.0,"The third of the Fortuna Meritas travel exclusive collection of Dalmore (the other ones are Valour, Regalis and the amazing Dominium), is amazing on the nose but fails to deliver on the palate. Still a good dram.

Bottled at 40%abv, tawny almost deep copper color.

On the nose it is absolutely fantastic. Perfect score here. amazing chocolate note, cherries bathed in chocolate, caramel, oranges, chocolate powder, dry cherries. Hazelnut, not a single alcohol note. Even if its not as intense as others, its amazing. Cocoa and Vanilla essence after a while.

On the palate it is too thin. Chocolate.
Feels buttery on tongue. Superbly sweet you can hold it easily. A little watery, Maybe too much. Coffee beans. Aftertaste is lovely but short with cinnamon and powder.

Overall this could be so much better since the nose is spectacular. It doesn't feel like a traditional dalmore since the raisins and figs are gone. 87 over 100."
2.5,I found this a bit muted - dried fruits and nuts throughout and somewhat sweet on the tongue - not Dalmore’s best in my opinion but not bad

3.25,"Not that complex as you expect yet very warming, calm and sweet.
A way bit too biting for a travel retail. Mouthfilling, way too sugary (really twee). You feel baked apples with honey, coffee, a bit of raisins.
Finish is not outstanding. Slight pepper and spicy caramel touch."
4.0,Apparently a bottle ment for airport sales only. Discontinued by now.
