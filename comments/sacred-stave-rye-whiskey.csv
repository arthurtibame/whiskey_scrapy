2.5,"The second in my San Tan Distilling tasting at their local pub (see previous Bourbon review). For this one again specifics are hard to come by much like the Bourbon. What we do know is it's distilled and aged by San Tan in the Phoenix Metro area and is less than 2 yrs old (again due to the lack of a straight designation). The mashbill is undisclosed and it also features interesting finishing this time in a Madeira wine cask. Like the Bourbon it's bottled at 45% abv. On to the review!
Upon entry it has more weight than the Bourbon and is very smooth. Initial notes are honey and a candied ginger note. This moves to a big array of natural red fruit notes that carries thru the almost medium finish. Like the Bourbon the Madeira cask is definitely propping up this dram. However, I would say the base distillate here is superior (which is pretty common for a young Rye to be more pleasant than a young Bourbon). If I had to guess I would say the mashbill features a pretty high malted barley % given the sweet and soft notes and really the lack of any real spice or bite. 
Overall it's a pleasant pour and of all their products this is the only one I would potentially buy. However, the issue is price. $42 or so a bottle while not a whole lot is too much for what you are getting. The Madeira cask almost makes it worth while but it falls just short of a bottle recommendation. Again, if you visit or live in AZ, I'd seek out a pour as it's worth it for a local product. 
Cheers all!"
