4.25,"Last time i had an Aberlour Casg Annamh was the Batch 001, and it was delicious, and i rated it 88 over 100. Without looking at that review, when i tried this Batch 002, the score was the same, and something also repeats: you should have this one in your collection as well.

Bottled at 48%abv, this one has a very lovely deep copper color.

On the nose: Blacknerry marmalade,
Glazed pork, sawdust, lacquer; dry vanilla cake, wedding cake. 

On the palate: more of the same.- blackberry marmalade, spicy ginger, nutty, prunes, liquorice.

Aftertaste is quite nice. Tobacco, ginger, some kind of herbal sweetness, chocolate.  

Overall this is a solid dram. Very recommended, very balanced. 
88/ 100."
