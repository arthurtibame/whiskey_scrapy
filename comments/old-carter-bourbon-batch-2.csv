3.0,"With the insane bourbon boom comes many very good all be it younger bourbon options.  This one also brings in a price tag nearing 200 bucks.  Sadly my intrigue out paced my annoyance with this ever growing high priced NAS bourbon market.  

Color and body are pretty much bourbon, cask strength.  It's coming in a bit lighter than say a 60 dollar ECBP, so I'm guessing we're a bit under 12 years, likely in the 7-9, but I have not researched it.  

The nose is very sweat, almost a banana bread like note, very little wood and the wood is this sweat nice tame note.  I'm not getting any oak bitterness nor am I getting those dark leathers or those old cherry notes.  I do however get some more fresh cherry like notes in here.  

Just like the nose this bourbon is all sweetness with just a few hints of oak bitter to keep it from being overly sweat.  Carmel, vanilla, touch of varnish (there's some age here).  There's a candied fruit note as well, something between a peach and a cherry but certainly not either.  I'm also getting perhaps a touch of custard, heavy in some bready notes.  

Finish is medium, it's nice.  It's not great.  

OK so I paid lets say 175, I bough it a while ago.  Is it worth it if you're willing to spend that on a bourbon?  That's a challenge for me.  This isn't for those of us who love heavy oak.  This isn't my favorite flavor profile where it gives me those more complex dark chocolates and cherries.  It however is a very middle of the road creamy sweat flavor without much bitter and really no off putting notes.  This is a bourbon you just can't dislike.  

I somewhat wish I'd bought a second bottle, but I'm really willing to spend on whisky I enjoy.  I can't recommend though, it's over priced and it isn't going to wow.  There are plenty of bottles in the 50-60 range that are going to compare to this.  I'd for example put a lot of 1792 bottles next to this, and there's a lot in common between the two."
