4.0,"Fruity and spicy, like a muffin. The barley and raisin notes play nice together, and there's full impact of flavours on the palate. Ximenez... there's the secret to make mediocre whisky stand out.

I really enjoyed this dram."

4.5,"In the island of Jura there is only one road, and it sure is, an excelent whisky. 

This new expression has been matured in a cask that previously held Pedro Ximenez Sherry for at least 20 years giving it a wonderful flavor profile. It is a part of a 3 whisky series, the other two are ""The Loch"" and ""The Sound"".

Bottled at 43.6%, with a lovely tawny color.

On the nose it is perfect. The sherriness is beatiful on the nose, very ""purple"".
Cigarrette peat, Tobbacco peat; Peppery; Marmalade; mint cigarrettes. There is a lemon note after some sips. Just beautiful.

On the palate: Super sherried. Sweet Maraschino cherries. Raisins. Its like a raisin juice, if that exists. 

The aftertaste is also amazing. It starts with a burn wooden log, then it gets Salty and Peppery. Peaty but very gentle.

Overall this is a great whisky, and was one point short of having a 5 star score. 94 over 100, it is super recommended and affordable."
