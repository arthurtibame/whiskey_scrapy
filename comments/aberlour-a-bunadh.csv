4.25,Very nice nose but the finish reminds me of blueberry poptarts 😍..such an interesting delicious finish
4.25,"Never been a sherry bomb enthusiast, but this is enjoyable. Rich, decadent berry and dark fruit with a little bit of spice. Cask strength is $"
4.75,Not normally a scotch drinker but this is fantastic. I love high proof whiskey and the raisin flavors that come through remind me of a whiskey version of Port wine. Not smoky like many scotches. Wonderful whiskey

4.75,So far this is my favorite Scotch. Amazing sherry nose. Plum and raisins on the taste with a vanilla medium finish. Batch #64 ABV 59.9%
4.5,"Delicious Sherry Bomb. Wish I had purchased a case.
Eye: Dark burgundy brown
Nose: Oloroso Sherry, Prunes, Raisins, 
Palette: Sherry Bomb, Sultanas, ripe Plums, a bit of oak. Great viscosity, mouth coating and warming. No hint of ethanol despite the 120+ proof.
Finish: Long....Sherry, vanilla, oak, with Raisin Bran 
Best cask strength Sherry Bomb I’ve JD to date. My batch was #49. I will definitely be buying another should I find it."

5.0,"I love this malt, the palate is lovely strong but very nice. Worth the £65 price tag and you cannot drink too many due to the strength."

3.75,"The nose is a bit hard to get. The palate is a combination of Westward, Nikka From The Barrel, and Johnnie Walker Green. There's some substantial spice with nice barrel and smoke. It's a bit bitter and has a bit much alcohol, but the flavors are generally good. There's some complexity, but mostly it is nicely balanced. It's quite good, though not exemplary. The fruit is nice and fresh without tasting immature. The fruit is clearly sherried with blackberry and strawberry notes. It's sweet, but more rich, spicy, smoky, and harsh."
4.25,"Apple nose, cinnamon, vanilla, STRONG"
