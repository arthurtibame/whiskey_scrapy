4.0,"Brown sugar and floral nose that is inviting, light and fresh.  Light on the palate.  Caramel, toffee, vanilla with a hint of fruit. and  strong vanilla.  As it gently dissipates, your palate is left with a dash of pepper, a hint of honey and green apple.  This is better then I recall from my original review (what up with that?).  This is how baseline Glenlivet should be: clean, fresh and natural. [$78][89/100]. [Tasted 3/1/2014 @ NYY Steakhouse]. [Revisited: 3/5/2015 @ Trumbull Kitchen]"

4.0,"Nose: Starts off with sweet and heavy apricot marmalade and fruity liqueur, which turns into chalk licorice. Wee smoke is there too.

Taste: Crispy and full. Thick and sweet, like jam. Occasionally bitter. Green apples, tropical fruits and hints of lemon. Bit of oak and vanilla as well.

Finish: Dry and crispy, like bitter orange marmalade with spices and little bit of ginger.

Balance: Rich, thick and freshly fruity dram. Good single malt from the great Speyside distillery."

With (lots of) added water, a heavy, brooding scotch-mist settles into the glass, revealing oak spices, floral malt and a satisfying mustiness... On the palate; almost instantly numbing straight, brash and roudy. Smoothes out nicely with a healthy measure of water. Malt, orange-spice and a hint of bitter lemon zest. Finish is long, warming and nutty, with a distinct flavor of buttered sourdough bread. An unspeakable shame this 16 year version has been discontinued, I'm going to savor this for a long time... ""Long Live Age Statements!"" Dry glass: banana split with chocolate syrup. [Update] If you follow our beloved Ralfy's advice and blend cask strength bottling with standard bottlings you get fascinating results... Nadurra 16 with standard 12  about 50/50 with two teaspoons of water creates a strong and distinct buttery vanilla cake batter note, both nose and palate, AMAZING."

5.0,"Wow, this glass brings me straight to fall.  It's like cupping an apple and a pear in either hand and taking big bites out of both, right in the middle of the orchard.  Then there's cereal, some oak, and underripe strawberry.  Great start.  The taste has a bit of a nutmeg and again it's full of pears and apples, but emphasizing the sweeter, riper side of those fruits, which makes this scotch like a liquid fruit tart.  Then on top of that, there's coffee, a sweet and salty combination, ginger, oak spices and tannins, and cherry.  It finishes with a final rush of orchard fruits, salted caramel, and the heat that I expected given the ABV.  For some reason, I hated the new, no age statement Nadurra First Fill.  But this one makes up for that.  Final note -- this scotch was bottled at cask strength so the proof varied.  The one I tried was 60.2%, so on the high end of the spectrum.

2.0,"I very much enjoy the Glenlivet 15 and 18 year expressions, and I'm also a big fan of cask strength whisk(e)y.  However, the Nadurra 16-year fell short of my expectations.  At full strength the ABV of 60.2% totally overpowers the delicate aromas and flavors (primarily consisting of apples, pears, oak and baking spices).  Adding water tames the alcohol, greatly enhances the fruit on the nose and on the palate, but the mouthfeel becomes much to thin.  This one is just not for me."

4.0,"* My bottle: from Batch 0814D, 55.7%

Nose: Buttery, caramel malt. Oranges and barley sugar. Strong vanilla and some honey. As it opens in the glass pear and stewed apple aromas emerge. There's something of the feel of a country kitchen about this nose, with fresh-baked pies cooling on a well-scrubbed wooden table. Later still apple blossoms and pineapple appear. Adding water makes the cask apparent.

Palate: Neat, the arrival is full of flavour but surprisingly not too hot. Quite buttery in texture and with an emphasis on malt. The development brings vanilla and some spicy pepper, with the texture turning dry. Orange oil. With water (and time - see below) the palate opens and broadens but does not change fundamentally.

Finish: Neat, the finish is long and primarily cereal/vanilla, turning quite dry with a touch of dark chocolate bitterness as oak spices carry on to the finale. Water softens the finish pleasantly.

Always an enjoyable dram, indeed a very fine one, but one I tend to neglect for some reason. It's a cask-strength batch expression and it definitely changes over time.  I've had expressions of this in the past that were quite coconut heavy, and others that were woody. The one I'm reviewing is buttery and fruity. The previous time I tasted it (batch 214E, 60.2%) my journal tells me I thought it was more red-fruit, biscuity and spicy.

One thing that all expressions of Nadurra share is that they are very easy to drown, so if adding water do so slowly, drop by drop. The profile does not change very much but if you go too far with the water it suddenly loses all its mojo.  IMHO you do need to tame it slightly, but I would suggest not taking it too far below 50%abv.

It also needs time to sit and develop in the glass, and if adding water give it more time to rest and recover before tasting - it may seem thin and lacking in character after dilution but it will develop sweetness and body again after 10 minutes.  Patience is well rewarded with this one.

My bottle was AUS$135, but now that it has been discontinued the price has rocketed. If you can still find any it will be around AUS$300.

5.0,Christmas spice and apple on the nose. Super strong vanilla marshmallow initially on the palate leading to cinnamon spice and oak smoke. Strong burn on the end to top it off. Surprisingly balanced between the smoke and spice with the sweet.

2.5,"Is it wrong to drink whisky for the texture and not the flavor?  Nadurra is a rare whisky that challenges us with that question.

Nose - Vanilla bomb!  Floral notes.  Toasted oak.  Perhaps a hint of pear.  

Taste - more vanilla and oak.  Take a malt whisky, give it all the notes of a bourbon with that fresh charred barrel and we're here.  However this is soft, gentle malt.  Giving off some honey and again really faint touches of fruits.  

So to that question - mouth feel.  This is the richest and creamiest whisky I can think off outside of a few bourbons.  It's soft alcohol that doesn't over power.  I did find the flavor is a bit better with a few drops but it does hurt the mouth feel a bit so a balancing act.  


80 bucks after tax.  If I find more I will buy more.  This is really really good stuff guys.  It's a shame they stopped doing age statements.  it is however pretty much a one trick pony.  It's not a wow bottle or one to save for special occasions.  Add in it's about 20 bucks more than most would like for a daily drinking scotch.  So 2.5 stars.  I can't say you have to have this if you're into bourbon finished scotch, but I think you get a bottle."

4.5,"매우 산뜻하고 싱그러운 향. 입에 넣었을때 cs다운 강렬함이 있긴 하나 매우 부드러움. 이 술의 진면모는 술을 삼키고 난 다음에 드러남. 기분좋은 꽃, 과일 등 각종 향들의 축제가 콧속에서 격렬하게, 그렇지만 너무나도 즐겁게, 거부감 없이 열린다. 그걸 지켜보고 있는 나는 절로 눈을 감고 너무나 행복. 힘든 하루를 마치고 집에 돌아와 한 잔 하기에 더없이 좋을 술. 단종된게 개인적으로 너무 아쉽다."
4.5,"I missed the boat on these age statement Nadurra bottles.  Up until 2014/2015 Glenlivet released the Nadurra (Gaelic for “natural”) line with an age statement of 16 years.  Dwindling stocks have forced them to make the entire line NAS releases now.  My journey into scotch didn’t kick into high gear until 2015, so I missed my chances at grabbing these bottles while they sat collecting dust on shelves locally.  Thankfully, these can still be found at auction for a decent price- that’s where I landed 2 bottles, including this one from Batch #0114A (basically, filled in January 2014.  I believe the “A” indicated which warehouse the cask was stored).  I scored this bottle, after auction premiums and shipping, for $78.  Quite the deal for a 16yo single cask in my opinion.  I absolutely love the NAS Nadurra releases- so how does an age statement bottle stand up to those?

It’s a crystal clear, new gold in the Glencairn.  It’s very oily with sparse legs and tiny droplets left behind- very indicative of the high proof of 55.3% ABV.

The nose is heavily honeyed with vanilla and beeswax dominating the initial whiffs from the taster.  Apples, pears and cut oak clearly let you know these were ex-bourbon casks and the whisky spent considerable time in them.  At no point did it smell hot nor abrasive in any way.  We’re off to a good start.

The palate again showcases sweet honey.  It’s hotter than the nose lets on, but it’s still really smooth and creamy.  The mid sip reveals all the wood characteristics and late in the sip there’s a wonderful cinnamon (Red Hots) candy and black pepper note.  It flushes away the sweetness and vanilla with a rush of intense power.  I really liked that part the most, I think.

The finish is long and the heat stays well after you’ve finished swallowing the whisky.  Actual cinnamon and vanilla linger on until you’re ready for another sip.

In conclusion, this one still holds up well.  I’m kind of shocked to say that I’m not sure this is better than the NAS Nadurra First Fill, which is good news to the powers that be at Glenlivet, because it proves they don’t need to age these casks longer and quality probably didn’t suffer by switching to younger juice.  They seem to be doing a fine job at selecting which casks are worthy of the Nadurra monicker.  I hope that continues.  These are the only Glenlivet I think I’ll spend my money on moving forward.  The entire Nadurra line just wins big in my book.  If I can keep scoring bottles of the 16yo at auction for a reasonable price I’ll probably keep buying them.  At $78, they are still cheaper than the NAS bottles on shelves locally ($85-90), so why not.  Do not be afraid to buy any of the Nadurra stuff- it’s quality juice.  This one gets a solid 4.25-4.5 stars from me.  Cheers, my friends."

Palate: syrupy sweet on entry with a big warming burn going down. White peach and ginger, allspice, sour grape, citrus zest, crisp malt, fresh bread dough. 

Finish: vanilla and orange creamsicle, dried apricots, barrel sour."

3.75,"So after watching Barcelona spank my beloved Liverpool, I decided that this was no lightweight Whiskey Wednesday. It called for a Cask Strength dram to wash away my sorrows and get over the hump of this neverending week! So my choices were Booker's, Rare Breed or to my surprise this one was sitting unopened on the top shelf collecting dust! Doing some quick recon on our favorite app I read @LeeEvolved review and decision is made! The abv of the bottle I sampled was a healthy 55.2% abv. It's also age stated at 16 years and aged in exclusively in ex-bourbon barrels. On to the tasting!
On the pallette it's a lovely blend of vanilla, caramel, malt, oak with a hit of orange peel. As we move to the mid pallette the baking spices show up leading to an oak, malt and caramel driven finish that is long. No dilution needed whatsoever even of it's a touch hot. Lovely effort and pour. 
So here is the rub, I own a 15 yr, cask strength Dalmore IB that I purchased for $65 (this one is not even available anymore but the current versions are between $85 and $95 in my market)) and it's significantly better. The Dalmore has more depth, flavor, complexity with a more oily body. My other critique is that for the proof, it does somewhat lack the depth of flavor I get from Bourbon, Rye or even the Dalmore at Cask Strength. 
Still, in isolation it's a damn good pour. For the price point, I would pass and buy one of the aforementioned options (ECBP, Stagg Jr etc). However, I think I will have another pour! Cheers all!"

4.0,"Time for the third and final review of my Nadurra samples from @LeeEvolved This 16 year old single malt is the original version of the Nadurra line. It is matured exclusively in first fill bourbon barrels. The First Fill NAS expression is the replacement for this one. As with the previous ones, this is an all natural presentation. Bottled at cask strength of 55.3% ABV and is non chill filtered and natural color of yellow gold. This is from batch 0114A. 

Incredibly strong notes of vanilla and toasted coconut on the nose. Heavy bourbon oak, orange marmalade, orange peel/oil and cinnamon. A bit tannic and nutty. Quite sweet smelling as well with marshmallow, barley sugar, toffee, butterscotch and peanut brittle. Fruity flavors of green grapes, pears, melon, apples and a light pineapple. Some honey in there as well with Nila Wafers and more vanilla. A few times I got anise and fennel, but those were very fleeting. 

The palate opens with peppery bourbon notes with sweet vanilla and oak. Orange peel, apples, pears, coconut and a vague tropical fruitiness. Barley sugar, a bit of a grain alcohol feel and cinnamon red hots. Nila Wafers, graham crackers, toffee, butterscotch and light caramel. The palate pretty much follows the nose here with no surprises lurking. 

A medium bodied mouthfeel that is creamy and mouth coating. 
The finish is medium length with vanilla, bourbon, oak and is dry. 

Vanilla is the dominant theme here, and while it does this well I feel that everything else is taking a backseat and doesn’t shine enough. Maybe it was just an off night for me, but I don’t think this one is better than the NAS version. In fact I believe I enjoyed that one more than this one, despite the 16 year age statement. Still this is well made and I enjoyed it quite a bit. Any one of the Nadurra expressions is worth the time and money. A solid 4. 
Cheers"

3.75,"Spicy, smoke, vanilla. Light burn."
4.0,"I have a bottle of 16 year that is coming to its end and thought I should do a little documentation before it’s gone. 

This is a 55.7% bottled 08/14, batch 0814D. I think Naddura is a great line, but new releases may be a disappointment from what others have said. 

Nose was vanilla and fruit, like a hint of a very ripe honeydew melon. 

Spicy on the palate neat and with a half ounce of water. Fruity in the sense of citrus with something like a tart berry or cherry, but in a pleasant way. I added another half ounce of water and the spice faded and made way for the sweeter and savory flavors to shine. 

Finish is fantastic. The feel is full but not particularly heavy. I thought the nuttier notes were more present in the finish vs the palate. Tobacco also comes to mind but too light and likely more oak flavor."
5.0,"I've got here one from batch 1214E, clocking in at a formidable 60.2% ABV. 16 years old, bottled in 2014. Many have claimed that Glenlivet's core line is too-watered down, tampered with, and generic. Let me be one to say that this a viable expression of Glenlivet for those of you who write them off for those reasons.

Nose: Fruity and floral. Pear, peach, coconut. Marshmallow, toffee, and vanilla, and a bit of honey. Some caramel and orange citrus. Touch of cinnamon and oak at the end, but nothing that would indicate a whisky that clears 120 proof. Very good, not remarkable.

Palate: Heavy on the bourbon cask notes. Vanilla, caramel, toffee, and cola. Very fruity; apple, plum, pear, apricot, and orange. Roasted cashew comes through in a big way. Graham cracker. About midway through, those subtle cinnamon and oak spice notes from the nose get turned up to 10. As the back of the box describes, the lack of chill-filtering results in a creamier and more full-bodied mouthfeel. Fantastic; this is where the whisky really begins to shine.

Finish: It's more of the roasted cashews, and interesting barrel char note. Some of the darker fruits from the palate linger: Gala apple and plum. Cinnamon, baking spice, and oak carry this on and on for what is long and stellar finish.

One of the best mainland Scottish malts I've had in some time. Hell, it may even be the best I've ever had within that specification.  Uncut, non-chill filtered, 16 years old, under $100 (ran me $87). A palate fit for Gods and a finish that goes on forever. Nothing to complain about here.

It's a shame that they dropped the age statement with the Nadurra releases. I'm fortunate to have found this one in 2019. At $87 this is a steal to the highest degree. This will be the first mainland Scotch I award the full 5 stars since I began writing full reviews and actually took the time to critically evaluate what's in the glass. This will be the new benchmark for quality and value.

Absolute must buy. At this point, I'd say it's the only way to drink Glenlivet. Hopefully they bring back the age statement. Wishful thinking? Maybe. But with something this good, I'd prefer to remain optimistic that I will one day get to try it again in this very form. If you're lucky enough to see one of these in 2019, you know what to do. Cheers!"
