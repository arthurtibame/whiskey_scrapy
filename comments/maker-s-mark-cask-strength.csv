4.5,"Great whiskey, smooth and oaky. Oh happy birthday to me."
2.5,"Nose- spiced vanilla, apricot, leather, plum, ethanol 

Palate- citrus, leather, vanilla, bit of caramel, toasted oak

Finish- Surprisingly short finish of oak and a bit of leather

Very short finish, which is it’s main downfall. It’s alright, especially for the availability and price. Much better cask strength bourbons out there, and for much cheaper. Would be great in a cocktail, but not a fan of it neat. Nothing crazy, wouldn’t buy another bottle."

4.25,"Batch No. 19-02; 54.8% alc/vol
Nose: Caramel Toffee, Vanilla, Eucalyptus, with hints honey and brown sugar. After a while you will get the floral and grassy notes.

Palate: Rich, complex and intense flavor. First sip is usually the spiciest, getting the sweetness of brown sugar upfront. When you hold it in, the spiciness builds up very quickly and gives cinnamon hints. 

Back: Smooth and immediate dryness. It is floral and grassy. Very wheaty. 

I bought this for $32, and it is worth more than I've paid for it."

4.0,"Sometimes I think that if a spirit tasted the same way it smells life would be fabulous. The nose gives a hint about what is inside the bottle. Granted a laege portion of our tasting happens with our nose, but still...MMCS smells like an amazing bakery. It truly does. Taste is VERY alcohol forward. What I wound up doing was leaving the bottle open for a few days and that seemed to help but it could use some more 'open-air time'. Beyond that, MMCS is a very good pour. While I did not like regular MM, I do like this. I will definitely buy another bottle."

palate- vanilla heavy, sweet baked pastries, candied apple. carbonation. a bit dry before finish.
Finish- long. more brown sugar and crisp apple.

4.5,Sweet. Long sweet finish. The high proof is pleasant and not too much burn
4.25,Very sweet as you would expect from Makers. The big difference here is a long sweet finish that is not dry or bitter. The alcohol is there but pleasant and not overpowering. Good stuff and worth the cost.
2.5,"Caramel and vanilla and at one point I think vasoline on nose, leather and sweet spice on pallet, minimal burn that doesn’t last on the back."
4.25,"This particular bottle came from a three-pack from Maker’s Mark called the Generations of Proof. Which also includes a Maker’s 46 Cask Strength as well as a Rob Samuels stave selection on a Private Select barrel.
This Maker’s Cask Strength bottle is 108.8 proof.
 
The nose is rich and full of old leather, cherries, old barn (in a good way), vanilla, caramel, a little cocoa and cooked dark fruit. Very nice.

The palate is sweet and oily with more rich leather, cherries and dusty corn. The fruit is bumped up a little here and just a tad of that cocoa. Very rich and full.

The finish is nice with just a little burn on the sides of the cheeks. You are left with some vanilla sweetness and corn for a long finish. There is some barrel char that pokes its head out as everything else starts to fade.

Wow, this is very good! These also vary in proof from batch to batch, so expect some variances from bottle to bottle. And the best part is, you can find this anywhere!
I knew I liked the regular Maker’s 46 and one bottle of a Private Select bottle I have, so I was happy to find it’s right up there. I can’t wait to try the Cask Strength of the Maker’s 46 and Rob Samuels’ Private Select next!"

3.5,"A really lovely honey/pastry scent with a decent amount of ethanol. There's even a citrus note on the forefront and background, if you whiff from a distance. The barrel wood comes to the palate at the very beginning, and then transforms to fresh citrus and caramel, bouncing back and forth between sweet and slightly sour or bitter. The finish is very hot, almost similar to a rye, but this is clearly from the proof. Going back for more sips transforms the scent more and more into caramel, and sweetens the entire affair while still maintaining the strength of the proof behind it."

3.5,"Batch 19-02 at 109.6 proof.

Nose is rich with a slight alcohol sting. Reminds me of Weller Antique (same mashbill and similar proof) but the scents are noticably more prominent. Sweet, vanilla, cherry, oak, baking spice. I didn't smell this until reading it elsewhere, but definitely a grass/wet hay note present. Altogether, smells just like a sweet bourbon vanilla candle.

First sip surprised me with the heat. Not overwhelming, but definitely pecked me right on the lips. Really nice mouth feel. Palette follows the nose initially with a pleasantly sweet spice that tingles the mouth and lingers. Trying to find more notes, there's a bit of cola that I've experienced in Buffalo Trace mashbills. 

It's pretty straightforward though. Not too much going on, but what is there works.

The finish is medium in length and the pleasant tingle of spice dissipates into a lingering sweetness until the next sip."

4.5,"This one clocks in at 109.6 proof, so it must vary by bottle.

Color: great golden copper tone

Legs: long to develop and tightly spaced

Nose: smells sweet with that very traditional Maker's scent.  Lots of Carmel and sugarcane. 

Body: thick and smooth, sweetness is very well balanced with the proof. Carmel is powerful with vanilla and slight bits of oak.

Finish: boom that's where the proof hits ya, that complexity as it rolls back goes from sweet to powerful and delicious. 

This is a really nice bottle, haven't been down the Maker's path in awhile but I enjoyed the stroll and will come back again soon."

4.0,"The standard issue MM is ok imo but im a hound for high proof so picked this up. My bottle is 113.3 proof . Poured neat, nose has cinnamon rolls and dryer lint tempered with cornbread and buttery oak. Palate is wallop of dusty shortbread cookie, butter and oak with some baking spice roundout. Touch of ethanol fumes float along but does not interfere. Finish is cinnamon oak dryout with some old cardboard and bread dough. This is some good bourbon. The higher proof delivers a healthy flavor dose with richness and depth. Blows MM out of the water and strong value as well. Easy recommendation.........90/100.....if you enjoy wheaters you really have to buy this"

4.0,"My third Maker's after the standard one and the 46, is this cask strength expression which didn't felt as high abv whisky at all, since i felt no alcohol note at all. Very clean and well crafted, this is an interesting bourbon.

Bottled at 55.8%abv, lovely reddish color.

On the nose, it has hints of a bourbon, but the notes are more complex and if we where making a blind tasting, you might guess it as an interesting single malt more  than a Bourbon. Spicy, Prunes; a Barbecue note so strong; Red fruits, Oregano, Glazed pork and Marmalade. 

On the palate, it is strange and interesting. A little Spicy; tastes as a Bloody mary, Orange candy. Not strong at all. 

Aftertaste is where the ""bourbonish"" profile appear. Prunes, Bananas, Vanilla and Herbal notes. Also Cotton sugar.

Overall, this is an interesting rollercoaster of flavors and aromas, but lacks to be tasty and pleasant. My score for it is 83 over 100. Cheers!"

3.75,"Blind tasting - 1.5 oz neat in a Glencairn - both bottles less than half full
Maker's Mark Cask Strength Batch 19-02 (54.8%, open since March) vs. 
Larceny Barrel Proof A120 (61.6%, open since February)

Color:
Very similar medium amber, #B slightly darker

Nose:
A - Subtle baking spices, cinnamon and nutmeg. Some oak mixed with citrus peel, light caramel and sugar
6/10
B - Bready oak and ethanol, toffee, nutmeg, toasted vanilla bean
6/10

Palate:
A - Oak and cherry, brown sugar, cinnamon bun, ethanol burn minimal
7/10 
B - Cinnamon and nutmeg flavored shortbread, stewed or jam dark fruits, burnt caramel, palate quickly overpowered by ethanol burn
4.5/10

Finish:
A - Tannic oak that lingers, medium oily finish, ethanol builds quickly
5/10
B - Strongly tannic and drying, long finish that burns, one-note flavor
3/10

Drinkability:
A - 6.5/10
B - 4.5/10

Total score:
A = 24.5/40
B = 18/40

A = Maker's Mark Cask Strength 19-02
B = Larceny Barrel Proof A120

I was surprised that I didn't really favor one nose over the other, despite there being clear differences. What sets them apart is the palate and finish. The Larceny BP runs hot, the ethanol and oak hit the tongue quickly overpowering other flavors and  dominates the finish. It is slightly unpleasant, especially compared to the MMCS. For me the Larceny is less complex and harsher to drink."

4.0,"Batch No. 19-02; 54.8% abv; 109.6 proof

I purchased another bottle of this because of my disappointment with the Larceny Barrel Proof A120, and because it was $10 off in March ($39.95). My goal was to see if Maker's holds up to Heaven Hill's new, higher proof wheated offering. I will do a blind tasting before I finish both bottles, but needless to say I'm still biased towards Maker's despite it being worse than the MMCS I purchased in 2019.

It was very floral and perfumey when I first opened the bottle. It was similar to a waft of citrus-scented cleaner, which is not necessarily a bad thing. But too much can be overwhelming, and thankfully that has subdued over the last 3 months. Now I get more cherry, cinnamon, dried grass, earthy floral, oak, and orange peel. The nose has improved a lot since it was cracked open.

The orange peel note disappears on the palate. I primarily taste caramel, sweet corn, oak, and cherry vanilla. The sweetness that was hidden on the nose by the citrus and floral notes is more prominent on the tongue. Finish is medium with oily oak spice lingering on the back of the tongue with hints of toasted caramel. 

Maker's Mark Cask Strength was consistently good across two batches, although I preferred Batch No. 18-02 last year. It still remains an excellent value at $50 and is almost always available in my area stores. Highly recommend checking it out if you're a fan of affordable high proof whiskey."
3.0,"Fucking hot! Lot of spice on this one. After a long time on a large cube it started tasting like a wheat bourbon. I will mix with Larceny and try the Poor,Poor mans Pappy."
5.0,"This was recommended to me as an alternative to Weller 107.
Like Weller it's a wheated bourbon at a slightly higher proof.
Like Weller it's spicy with a sweet finish, caramel apple and vanilla. MMCS is also a bit hotter.  The proof of the bottles can range and are printed on the label; mine was on the weaker side at 109.1 with a 114 max.
I prefer MMCS neat. 
MMCS is, by a considerable margin, the single finest bourbon I'd ever tasted under $40 and one of my very favorites at any price."
4.0,Sweeeet with a beautiful finish. Bursting with sweet and rich flavor that finishes very smooth. Vanilla and caramel with just enough spice that finishes obnoxiously smooth for a 56% alcohol drink.

4.5,"Batch 20-01, 55.05 % abv. 

Sweet meadow grass, floral grain nose. Big fruit, vanilla, oak char, giving way to spicy rye in the mouth. Not overly hot, but an expansive first taste followed by a medium mouthfeel. Finish is char and eucalyptus, saline and pepper, lingering a good while. A really lovely wheated high rye bourbon at a proof that blunts the sweetness of regular Makers."

4.0,"Giving the Maker’s Mark Cask Stength a try for the first time tonight. 
Not as strong to the smell as it is with the first taste. The heat fades, but at 110 proof it warms the tongue and belly. With tastes of citrus and hints of charred vanilla. I definitely liked it. I like lower proof personally, I enjoy them better. I’d say it lives up to its price and rating though."
