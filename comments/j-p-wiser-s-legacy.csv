5.0,"Along with Lot 40, it's probably the pinnacle of the new breed of (American rye-esque) Canadian whiskies. Flavours of creamy, bright vanilla, butterscotch, caramel, natural (not fake syrupy) maple, big, big oak--fresh cut and toasted, with a bit of cedar, too. Wood-sap. Green apples, red apples, spicy rye, dusty rye, rye bread, pickles, sourdough, clove, cinnamon. . . . Velvety taste but with a nice rye spice, white pepper, granny smith, fresh bread and baking spices, faint citrus. Oak-y on the finish. Legacy is the star of the Wiser's line-up, and it's not even the most expensive regular offering (hell, it's not even the *second* most expensive regular offering, and it blows both the 18 year and the Red Letter away). Recognizably Canadian, but demonstrative of the fact that, if pressed, the Canadian whisky industry can do really interesting things without losing what makes the style unique. Delicate and light, and yet complex, too: balanced, lovely oak-spice flavours, and just a bit of sweetness. Take your Crown Royal Northern Harvest, this is--perennially--my Canadian whisky of the year."

4.0,"Sweet and spicy. Well balanced with caramel, oak, floral, and rye spice notes. Exactly the same profile as Gibson's Finest 12 Year but all around more robust. It can be slightly spicy to sip neat but it has excellent flavour. It’s been discontinued so make sure to grab a bottle while you can. $50 in Ontario."

3.0,"Nose: oak, cereal, shoe polish, vanilla it's rye!! Palate: light mouthfeel. Spicey, clove just a hint of sweet, herbal almost amaro. Gingerbread. Finish: medium length, clean. A very solid example of classic Canadian whisky done properly. A solid value and something Wiser's is justifiably proud of. 89/100."

4.0,"Solid 4.0 for me.

$49.95 in Ontario"
4.0,"And another surprise from Canada.  I guess I shouldn't be shocked when Canadian whiskey doesn't all taste like standard Crown Royal, but to find this richness of flavor and depth of character in more than a few forces me to reconsider my general malaise for the style.   Don't let this one sit in the glass too long or the nose will whither quite rapidly.  On fresh pour though, it is awash in baking spices and sawdust, all blended well and playing nicely together.  No stand-outs, nothing that needs to have the edges knocked down a bit, and while it's not overly complex, it is enticing.  Palate  is warm and mouth-coating from front to back. Rich sweetness reminiscent of fresh caramels, with just that hint of buttery oiliness, and then the baking spices come back.  Mostly vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon, but a subtle thread of white pepper and ginger add a welcome touch of heat that keeps the dram interesting.  Heading to the finish that heat grows just a little too much, and the first touch of dryness works hard to overpower the wonderfully fresh apple pie that somehow appeared from nowhere.   Dryness fades on the start of the finish allowing a good bit of wood, leather and tobacco to pop in for a quick hello before it returns and leaves you with a very pleasant maple/vanilla tingle.  I don't think it's a 94 nor is it my favorite of the rich Canadian blends, but this is a solid drink, and at a very reasonable price."

3.0,"94 on Distiller is a bit of a stretch (talk about straining credulity), however this is still a good whisky. The nose lacks complexity, though the rye and oak are predominant. The palate is slightly syrupy, with a finish that is pleasant though short. Again, it's good but quite boring."
3.0,"This whiskey has a very similar nose to stalk and barrel blue blend. That's not a good thing. Fortunately, legacy is palatable and doesn't have the artificial flavour of S&B. Strong butterscotch and maple on the nose. What makes this decent, is the palate and finish. The artificial smell is absent and it's not too bad. I would not buy this again. $49.95 @ lcbo (fortunately I got this on clearance for $35). 84/100"
5.0,"Smooth, great to sip. Vanilla and a bit leathery. Almost deceiving on the nose with a bit of spice."
