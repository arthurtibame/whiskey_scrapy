4.0,"I opened this last night to share with some friends and family.  I’ve heard really good things of the 18 yr Albariza, so was hoping this can replicate it, especially considering that 18yr old isn’t available anymore.  

Personally, I feel there’s a few combinations that work really well—-Peat+port, Peat+PX sherry, and peat+oloroso are some of my favorites.  So, with this peat+PX, I went in with high hopes.  It’s really good...but I felt as if it was about a few years too much in the barrel.  I felt as if the barrel was probably overactive, and ideally would’ve peaked around 17-19yr.  But I know I’m nitpicking—-a 22 yr single malt is a luxury in itself.  

At first whiff, you get the earthy peat, not the Islay medicinal, but more mushroom-y.  Followed in taste by a sweet nutty flavor and a smoky aftertaste.  

It’s damn good...but just a tad over-oaked, in my opinion. 
If you see the 18, grab it...I’m guessing that may have been the epitome of a good speysider / highlander Peated single malt."
4.0,"One part of me was really hoping it would be as great as the 18 year, my wallet was hoping it wasn't as I'd spent waaay to much recently on spirits. With regret the latter won out. 4 years to much in my opinion. Whilst very good it's slightly over oaked and even with loads of time and some water, the finish is shorter and slightly bitter. It reinforces my opinion that in general I think most whiskey seems to peak around the 15 - 18 mark and even younger if peated.  Oh well I have a 22 year moscatel being delivered tomorrow which should console me (one that did push through the 20 year mark nicely). I might soon crack the 17 year Solstice 2nd Edition open so I can see if it's worth buying another one whilst still in stock."
