4.0,"Knob Creek Rye is a tough bold full flavor 100 Proof bruiser of a whiskey. So much FLAVOR packed into each sip - an excellent value at the $30 I usually see it at! NOT boring at all, has good complexity, strong flavors starting mid palate, and a nice medium viscosity. Starts off lightly sweet and soft, then the flavors build to a STRONG flavorful finish with the Knob Creek charcoal and building warmth. I also pick up a slight Jim Beam nuttiness which I dig. Good Whiskey at a great price, it has plenty of tasty flavor and excitement. If you are into Rye pick up a bottle already!"

4.25,"This is a bold, nutty rye. I am lost how anyone could classify the initial flavor as subtle because it is more of a blast of nuttiness, that delightfully hits my palate today. It does not have the same balance as Bulleit 12 year rye or the variety of Peerless Humidor, but this is an incredibly tasty rye for the price point. I picked it up on sale for $26."

4.0,"Lots of hoopla and high praise for this rye so I had to get it plus Im a fan of KC bourbon. ( side note: I cant stand the waxy seal Knob Creek uses! I digress) Poured neat, nice rich color with thick legs. Nose is Bulleit bourbon like with heavy leather, varnish, dusty cardboard and wood all laced with tea leaves, dry rye spice and toasted dill. Not a lot of sweetness, some light apple and cinnamon which makes palate quite jarring. Thick creamy mouthfeel brings an explosion of flavor! Excellent rye spice dough with candy apple and smoky cinnamon come rushing in along with sweet oak and char. Absolutely fantastic!! Delivers much more sweetness and depth than nose indicates and 100pf is not an issue at all. Even has the Knob Creek RC cola note. Finish is long with charred oak, fading rye dough with cinnamon, maple and faint dill. This is some serious rye. It stands shoulder to shoulder with mighty Pikesville. Just so much flavor assaulting the palate.........90/100.......... I love it when the taste is so much more than the smell, doesn't happen often but awesome when it does."

4.0,"Nose: Oak, dill, brown sugar, cardamom.  Lemon oil.  Cinnamon, clove.  Bread, cereal grain.  Celery.  Eucalyptus.  Pepper.

Palate: Oak, brown sugar, dill, vanilla.  Celery, cucumber, pepper.  Stone fruit.  Cereal grain.  Creamy.

Other notes: I'm surprised it took me so long to try this.  It's got everything I'd expect from a rye, but the balance is unmistakably Knob Creek.  The proof shows up without being overpowering.  A really decent rye, especially given the price point near me."

4.5,"This is a superb rye, the rye brother of Knob Creek bourbon. It is a beautiful light brown in the glass.The nose is rye spice, fine leather, and a dark Karo corn syrup sweetness. these are all found in the mouth as well, with the addition of the ever so light hint of mint often found in rye whiskey. It is 100 proof, but drinks like an 86 proof. This is one of my favorite rye whiskies. Not sure which one I would choose to live with forever if stranded on a desert isle, but this would be on the short list."

3.25,I’ve tried this a few times now and it’s good but not was I was envisioning when I purchased it. I like the higher proof and that is where this shines but it also drowns out the rye. Like the heat but wish the rye wasn’t so muted.
2.5,"This is the second time I feel I have tasted a light menthol/mint note in the aftertaste of a Jim bean product, have to take a closer look at the sourcing of the basil Hayden bourbon and this product because I noticed it in both. The basil hayden had a much more pronounced and problematic menthol note to the point I do not enjoy drinking it at all. However the rye is a little bit better, as it has been bottled at 100 proof and the rye overwhelms any menthol minty flavors. This is an ok rye and for how much I paid for it / difficulty in finding  I much prefer Rittenhouse, or High west double rye in the same price range."

3.25,"The nose has an even amount of soft vanilla, rye and an herbal note along with some sweet corn and hints of dark fruit.

The palate has a nice thick and oily texture. It’s on the sweeter side with corn, vanilla, dusty rye, and an herbal note.

The finish on the longer side and kind of sits at the top of your chest with lingering vanilla and a little rye left on the palate.

Overall, this one hits some nice points. Nice mouthfeel, proof and it’s not overly rye’d, which I like."

4.25,"What a wonderful Rye this is. I bought this with a few other rye whiskeys and this one was the greatest surprise. It is a great full-flavored Rye and did not shrink when water or ice is added to it. I was as impressed with this whiskey as I was disappointed in Michter's. In the glass, it is a wonderful amber. On the nose, this is full of caramel, citrus, and rye spice, along with vanilla and some oak. The body was just as good with some heat and oak but a very nice rye spice mixed with a citrus sweetness. The finish was long and spicey with vanilla and oak lingering. When I added a touch of water so many of the notes were there just a bit softer and easy. In an Old Fashioned this stuff rocks. It is just amazing. I have not made a Manhattan with it as I have not bought any sweet vermouth in a long time but I will get to it. For the price, it is an outstanding Rye whiskey. Enjoy."

4.5,"With a few drops of water, this is excellent. The nose has quick bread with a little bit of spice and a hint of both wood and fruit. On the tongue, it is an excellent balance of spice and sweetness. The finish is that of dry rye toast."
4.0,"Nose: Oak, slight vanilla, big citrus oil and and pine notes.  Spices - vegetal herbs with plenty of dill, basil, and thyme.  Mint/wintergreen, and clove/anise/nutmeg.  The oak almost presents with a bready quality, and I'm not mad about it.  Proof is evident but balanced.  Subtle hints of worn-in leather, cocoa, and tobacco, along with toasted black pepper.

Palate: Lightly sweet vanilla and oak.  Cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, with a little anise.  Cream cheese frosting type sweetness.  Chocolate, cherries, and ripe apricots.  Fuyu persimmon, and a little amaretto.  Good tannin, to boot.  Body is medium, with good oil content.  Finish starts with a flash of almond bitterness, persimmon, and those baking spices.  Texture from the tannin ramps up, then slowly gives way to a beautiful whipped cream with vanilla and almond extract.  The fadeout is nice and leaves you with anise, almond, cream, honey, and mint.  Medium-long finish.

Other notes: Coming back to this is wild.  Looking back at my last tasting, I can see why i interpreted some of the flavors the way I did at the time.  This is still very enjoyable and, for the price, hard to beat.  I'll have to give it another buy again soon - might even be something to keep in the cabinet regularly."

A high strength (50%abv / 100%proof) Rye Whiskey, Knoob Creek threw it out of the park with this one.

On the nose is where it is less appealing: with raw rice notes and slight red fruitiness.

On the palate it was AMAZING. An explosion of red fruits. Pepper and ginger spiciness, sweet rye, raw rice. Great flavor. 
Aftertaste has this beautiful rye spiciness. 

Overall this dram deserves at least an 86 over 100, lovely whiskey, totally recommended."

3.0,Nose and palate are initially traditional rye spice. Palate becomes bready with some sweetness on the back end and the finish is simple with a short spicy note. Water brings out sweetness with the spicy nose. Palate remains spicy but gets more bread like with a bitter note on the end. Not bad but there are better near the same price point. It is worth noting there is some oil on this one. On second and a longer visit I do get more wood in the finish. Otherwise still pretty simple and spicy.
