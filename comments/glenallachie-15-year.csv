3.75,"Nose: dark sherry, apricots, cinnamon and sour apple rings. The nose gets sweeter over time but has a faint artificial ester note.
The palate is on par with the nose at it delivers dark sherry and fruity notes up front. It lingers on and offers honey, dark brown sugar and spices. The finish is medium and has pleasant oaky character but fades rather quickly. 

Summary: Generally, it is a good whisky and caters towards the sherry 'monster' aficionados. However, I have the impression the sherry is not well incorporated into the destillery character. This results in a sherry overloaded, unbalanced whisky that could have been magnificent, but it isn't. It is a decent whisky don't get me wrong, but I would always prefer the 12yo, which is my favourite expression of this destillery. (84/100)"
3.5,Sweet and fruity
4.25,"Nose - Rich fruity honey, dark red stone fruits, berry fruit leather, dried apples, cinnamon red hots

Taste - Sweet berry honey, dark dried red berries, ripe strawberries/dark cherries, hint of ginger

Finish - Lingering sweet heat, red berries, apple/berry fruit leather, berry honey

Score - 86/100

Final Thoughts - Very nice nose, sweet red berries & thinned out honey dominate from start to finish. This one is quite the dessert dram for sure. I think this would pair very well w/ either dark chocolate or maybe an apple tart or something. This is quite tasty, but it's a bit sweet even for my taste. Nice balance of flavors and nothing off putting, just a bit overall sweet.
