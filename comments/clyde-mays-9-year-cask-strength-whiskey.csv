4.0,"I couldn't believe that a 9 year old cask strength whiskey could be rated so poorly, so I decided to try it myself: It's a brownish color, no real legs. First thing I pick up on the nose is vanilla, then the notes of dried apple as would be expected, then the chocolate comes through. I did note a touch of vinegar, which could explain the negative score. Very rich and smooth on the tongue. I pick up the apples and the cinnamon. great long finish. Overall,  this is a very good whiskey and would certainly buy it again. I think the reviewer should give it another shot."
