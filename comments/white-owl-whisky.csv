1.0,"Genuinely awful. A ""white whisky"" whose gimmick is that it isn't new make; it's *actually* aged whisky. . . . It's just then coal-filtered to remove any colour. Surprise, surprise, though: removing colour also removes any flavour, and what's left resembles a bad vodka. Clear colour. Smells of citrus soda (maybe it's the colour influencing my perception), grain, and just a hint of butterscotch-caramel. Your typical Canadian profile, only worse, because it's also got some serious paint-thinner character as well. Strangely sharp while also being super bland. And that contradiction continues on the taste, which is somehow both watery and sharp. Raw grain. Fire. Synthetic butterscotch/caramel. Vanilla ice cream. If I could give zero stars, I would. White Owl is genuinely putrid; it takes all the weaknesses of Canadian whisky as a genre to begin with, and it makes them even worse; hell, it doesn't even mix well."

4.0,Has a mellow taste with good consistency. I wouldn't consider this a great sipping whiskey more of one you'd use in mixed drinks.

2.25,Not much of a “whisky” flavour. More similar to a vodka than I was expecting.
