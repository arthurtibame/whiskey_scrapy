5.0,"On the nose this it's more unassuming, however wants you begin to sip it you find yourself trapped in the amazing flavors.

It maintains a smooth sweetness that feels natural and pure on the tong, while simultaneously delivering a spice that you expect to have in a rye. 

It completed this all while hiding the high alcohol content with the smoothness of drink.

This rye comes out of the original Old Crow distillery.

As far as ryes go, this is by far one of the best ryes I have had."
