4.25,"Just opened this, my first Booker's. Passed on the 2017-03s that were left but might go back and see what is still available. The '18- 01 Batch is strongly aromatic of rye when first opened, and with my somewhat stuffy nose, a bit medicinal. But poured into a proper tasting glass it changes very quickly to closely follow the Distiller's review, at least for me. I love the color of this whiskey. The legs are spaced almost with regular precision and very long. I really like this bourbon. I drink almost every proof neat, at least at first, and this one has a very nice level of heat without pain. It enhances the full bodied experience and the spice, both with the nose and the buds, is generously proportioned. Finish is Medium as described but quite satisfying. Now if I could only corral a bottle of Tommy's Batch I would likely be even happier. But alas, late to the party ...
          
          Edit: July 2018      Did in fact corral a bottle of Tommy's Batch (2017-1), along with a Front Porch Batch (2017-3), and indeed I am a very happy man now with 3 delicious Booker's in the barn!

All $79.99 USD in PA."

5.0,"Found this for $50.00 in the costco in vista, ca!  Definately going to get a few more bottles.  I'm still new at figuring out the notes of what I drink and normally can't tell what they are but I found mostly brown sugar and caramel on the nose.  Still working out the rest but it had a nice long finish that lingers in your mouth because of the slightly syrupy texture.  In my opinion the texture is perfectly balanced.  I prefer it neat."

5.0,"This is what a bourbon should be. Full bodied, unbeatable nose, and rich and oily. This has tons of baking spice, sweet vanilla, and a touch of oak. This is on the sweeter end of the spectrum and is one of my favorite bourbons on the market right now. If you can find this, buy it!"

5.0,"$69.99 @ BevMo
One of the better batches of Booker's in recent memory. Big Vanilla and Oak smacks you in the face upon entry. Followed by a swell of clove and baking spices on the mid palatte. Finish is more vanilla and oak, with some tobacco. The finish is long and a bit drying, however, it's never out of balance. This Bourbon is most remarkable for it's drinkability and smoothness at this proof. Adding a few drops of water does mellow it, however, I prefer it neat. Outside of the stellar Bluegrass batch, this is the best Booker's batch in the last 2 yrs. Any fan of high proof Boubon must buy this!"

5.0,"Introduced to Booker’s when my sister got me a bottle of the Blue Knights Batch for my birthday.  Instant fan.  When I saw this batch, Kathleen’s, I had to try it.  I always try neat at first, and this baby packs a punch, as I have learned Booker’s is notorious for as it is uncut and cask strength.  Added a few small pieces of crushed ice, swirled, and tasted again.  Sweet, oak in the beginning then brown sugar/molasses as it trails off.  This punches hard in an amazing way.  I went to multiple locations to get more before it disappears, sold out everywhere.  Finally found a place with 2 more and one Blue Knight left, so I grabbed all three.  $69.99 is standard price in the Chicago suburbs"

    Palate: 4 | sweet, viscous, caramel, butterscotch
    Finish: 4 | big sweet finish, slight spicy

3.0,It smells sweet and I know I'm supposed to taste vanilla... but im really just getting the rich and spicy with maybe a moderate vanilla. Good if you're looking for something strong but I've had better from Booker's for my own tastes.
5.0,"Nose leads with caramel and peanuts. Vanilla sits in the background. The palate starts with tobacco, caramel and cinnamon, while vanilla continues to take a back seat. The finish is long and warm. Smoky tobacco is the star with only a little caramel."

5.0,"Rich rounded oak, floral rye spice, roasted peanut, and a background of toffee sweetness surrounded by the powerful heat of the ABV. Like a high octane mix of Blanton’s and Wild Turkey Rare Breed. It’s not as leather-bound as the previous Booker’s batch I sampled at the bar, but it’s still probably the best bourbon I’ve had. Price recently increased to $100 in Ontario. Thanks trade war..."
4.0,"Not quite the 2017-04 batch, but very good.
    
    Peanuts, oranges, and toffee on the nose with some boozy vapors. Black pepper, meringue, very powerful so it knocks you back a bit. Long finish."

4.0,"Note- Thick molasses and soy sauce. 
Body- Whooo! This one will punch you in the throat hard. Molasses and soy sauce continue. There is a lot of spice on it op of all of that. 
Finish- More of a feel than a taste. My taste buds are going nuts on both sides of my tongue. 

Added ice- so nice! Vanilla and cinnamon balance one another. This all culminates in a pecan pie finish. Delicious with one cube of ice! Buy this!"

4.0,"Nose: heavy rye spice (dill licorice etc) candy corn. Heavy cherry. 

Taste: corn bread and cherry throughout. Clove, cinnamon, and brown sugar. No oak note at all which is good if you don't like that. Barely some red apple in there as well. Classic Beam style banana and peanut notes."

4.5,"Straight up bomb. But, at the same time delicate and complex. The nose explodes with pecan and sweet potato pie, cherry pie filling, dark molasses, Vienna Fingers, potted flowers, rosemary and nutmeg. But given air, develops into maple syrup covered waffles, cornbread, and leather. The finish hangs on for dear life. It’s like a big bear hug from Kentucky."

4.0,"Nose - Roasted nuts, caramel, orange peel, oak, and vanilla. Was expecting more heat/ethanol given the proof.

Palate - that Beam peanut note is definitely there, along with caramel and some baking spices. The finish lingers with vanilla, oak and some cinnamon. 

Not as concentrated (or hot) as I've come to expect from Bookers, I'd say this is a kinder, gentler Bookers (which is not a bad thing, I quite like it)."

4.0,"Pleasant fruit and honey on the nose. Some cinnamon and potpourri as well. It's like apple pie in the fall. Sweet and spicy on the palate. Lingering spice. Doughy also, salted butter., hint of dark chocolate. Seriously, pie. For adults. Good stuff. 5/8/19"
4.75,"Hard to beat Booker's, this batch is especially great. It's a bit more ""delicate"" than other batches which adds a bit more complexity in my opinion."
4.5,"63.7% abv
Uncut and Non chill-filtered
Aged 6 years, 3 months and 14 days

Nose: strong vanilla; dark char; rye and clove spice; cherry/cherry cola; alcohol from the high Proof. All in all, delish.

Taste: medium body, viscous and full flavor! Vanilla and dark brown sugar and caramel; slight mint; cherry; rye spice

Finish: long and rewarding. Peppery spice, vanilla, hints of mint, peanut, toasted marshmallow, oaky barrel char and a delicious caramel toffee at the very end.

Value: $60-75. Worth it.

Final thoughts: I’ve never been disappointed by a Booker’s batch, but this one is a hair above the average and the best of the 2018 batches. Grab this or any Booker’s without hesitation and use water liberally to tame the burn, open up the flavors, and enjoy the ride.

Score: 4.5/5

Highly recommend buying a bottle

4.25,Tastes of honey and tart green apples. Strong flavor. Finishes with a hint of nutmeg.
4.0,"A sample gifted from the ""Whiskey Transfer Program"" from dthom.   A very complex whiskey with the signature Beam nutty flavors that I've come to expect.

Nose: Musty wood, butterscotch, a slight raisin scent, and heavy ethanol (no surprise given the proof).  The prevailing smell?  Bubblegum like Big League Chew.

Flavor: This doesn't bite as hard as the proof would suggest.  Sweet vanilla, dried fruits like cranberries, and brown sugar.

Finish: Peanut Butter.  Lots of peanut butter and then sandalwood and tobacco mixed with cloves that tastes kind of like a clove cigarette.  It finishes strong with more chunky peanut butter.  The finish is the best part here for sure.

My first foray in to the Booker's world and I like it.  I'd definitely try more though the price point is a little steep."
4.5,Amazing Bourbon!  Has a great nose...opening...middle... & finish.  Excellent buy!
4.25,"A whiskey of beautiful extremes, Booker’s 2018-01 greets the nose with ripe red apples, cooked pears, buttery toffee, butterscotch, buttered toast, coffee candies, shelled peanuts, and a beautiful rye spice with cinnamon, cloves, and a bit of black tea. Like an almond roca dipped in fire. The palate hits hard with sweet caramel, dried apples, toasted peanuts, dark dusty oak, roasted corn, and a rich fiery spice of black pepper, allspice, cinnamon, cloves, and ginger. A long deep burn in the chest follows with an exhale of toasted walnuts, almond butter, burnt sugar, and a pleasant bitterness akin to a strong black coffee. A spicy, sweet explosion in a glass."

4.25,"Neat.  Getting a nice vanilla off the nose.  Maybe some cherry.  The proof doesn’t hit me at all surprisingly.  Mouth feel is very unique.  Almost a port wine quality to it.  I wouldn’t call it creamy but thick and dense.  Flavor is wood, vanilla, dried fruits.  Transitions to chocolate and a nice spice.  Hangs well on the palate with a numbing vanilla.  Smooth sipper."

4.0,"To be honest, I’m not sure which batch this was. But I loved every second of it! It is very hot, and exceptionally full flavored. My very first sip of the bottle turn it off, but it was because I had never had anything like it. Any chance I can have to get a bottle, I snatch it up. Just had every classic bourbon flavor, but on steroids! Carmel, vanilla, cinnamon, and heat!! I can’t figure out the oiliness of the mouthfeel due to the flavours, but it’s full. Very full. Will clear your nose! And the longest finish I can recall. The only one I like better then this - for a special occasion drink - is Baker’s. And I’m not a JB fanboy - just a bourbon fanboy!"
