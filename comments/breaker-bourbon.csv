5.0,I can’t believe this only gets an 82.  This is a wonderful after dinner whiskey with some dark fruit and vanilla goodness.  I used to drink the shit out of breaker but not I can’t find it on the east coast anymore

4.0,"Brown sugar, orange peel, clove nose. Palate mimics the nose, plus molasses taffy and graham cracker crust.
Pleasant med+ finish, dark chocolate and dark honey.
Nice on its own, or in an old fashioned."
2.0,"Strong nose, intense yet pleasant. Fruity, wer oak, some brown sugar, as well as alcohol sting. Young notes on the palate, but not harsh. Sweet, wood notes, and some orchard fruit and pecan nibs. Not overly complex but solid. Spice lingers and warmth is decently long. 7/23/18"

2.0,"Tasted as part of a flight of Devils River, Breakers Bourbon, Elijah Craig Small Batch, and Bernheim Wheat Whiskey.

Nose:
Sweeter nose. Trying to place it. Not quite honey, but not butterscotch, or caramel. Well actually, I'd have to say vanilla.
Wow. On 2nd nose after tasting the Elijah Craig this smells like bubble gum. Fruity sweetness. Deeper color than the Devils River, but not as dark as the Elijah Craig or Bernhelm.

Tasting:
Thin and sweet. It's a light flavor profile without finish. Maybe they should carbonate and sell as Red Pop."
