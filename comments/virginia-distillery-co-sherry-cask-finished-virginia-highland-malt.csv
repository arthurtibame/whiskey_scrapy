2.0,"A bipolar whiskey that does not know what it wants to be. Similar to scotch with elements of smoke, malt, brine and vanilla. Not much sherry so not sure how long it was finished. The color suggests not long at all. The taste, not at all."

3.5,"750ml poured neat in taster at home.  Very lite colour.  Nose has corn, hay, lite smoke, apple peel.  Taste has black pepper spice, hay, some sweet sherry presence on the roof of the mouth, hint of almonds.  A couple drops of water improves this a ton, letting the sweet notes come out from underneath the black pepper.  Not great, but worth a try. 7/20/19"
