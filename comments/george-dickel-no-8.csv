3.0,"While No. 8 is a good solid whisky and I believe superior to Jack Daniel's No. 7, this is not the flagship Dickel product. The No. 12 is the flagship.  No. 8 has more burn than the No. 12 and you pick up more char flavour. It is a great Tennessee Whiskey for mixing and makes a great mint julep. If you want a good whiskey for when your friends are over and they want a mixed drink keep this in your cabinet. Get a bottle of No. 12 for sipping, your Scotch drinking friends might even like it."

3.0,"Light golden color. Simple delicately sweet nose. Enters sweet followed by heavy char. I get a little banana cream, but not nearly as much as I get with the Dickel 12. Easy, dry finish with mild burn. Drop in a couple cubes of ice and it really amps up the char, but kills the sweet. Not a complex dram but none the less a good sippiing ""whisky"". Better than Jack at a substantially lower price. I'd still throw in the couple extra bucks and get the Dickel 12."

3.0,I found this tHis to be the best value whiskey/bourbon to date.  For the price it was smooth mild and better than others in the price range.  While it certainly lacks the character of other brands I like this as an every day drinker.

2.0,"[Re-Review 02/08/16] Faint licorice, with caramel, and maple syrup on the nose. Certainly inviting. Dark Amber color with thick sticky legs.  Candied mouthfeel, just like syrup on pancakes.  Continued tastings pave the way for spice over flavor.  Water eliminates the spices and introduces sweet vanilla.  Swift oak spice on the way down, and prominent cinnamon aftertaste.  My second time around I get a burnt maple ash finish which doesn't resonate well.   This doesn't hold well on its own, and it doesn't really add anything interesting to any cocktail I've tried to mix it with.  Skip."

2.0,"Bottle #11 in a 12 days of Christmas gift set; This whisky has a theme; and the theme is that it's pretty average all aorund.  Nose is woody, with a splash of vanilla and a dash of chemicals like you'd get from smelling imitation vanilla extract.  It's not bad, but it's neither inspired nor inspiring.  Palate is much the same; sweet corn, vanilla, brown sugar and wood fade quickly to a drying, hot finish that burns for a few seconds and finally disappears cleanly.  Better than Jack Daniels, and like JD, this was truly destined to make Coca-Cola drinkable.  My suggestion?  Spend a few extra bucks and Get the Dickel 12, which is still good in Coke, but also acceptable all by its lonesome."

3.0,"There's no such thing as a bad Dickel, or that is at least the conclusion I came away with after my wife, 7 month old daughter, and I made a little stop at Cascade Hollow to take the tour and sample the goods at the Dickel Distillery. This is no exception; in fact, it was my wife's favorite of the bunch (she found it the smoothest, which I suspect has to do with the lower abv). She's not even a whiskey drinker and even she likes some Dickel every now and again. And...Dickel 8 really is one of the best budget whiskies out there on the shelves. Sweet corn, vanilla, caramel, and a little woody spice get the job done. It's not complex, it's not nuanced, it's not particularly refined, even by Dickel's pretty straightforward flavor standards (the Dickel ain't subtle). If you want a great base for a whiskey and coke, or some Kentu...erm, Tennessee tea, or a pleasant sipper on the rocks to cool off on a hot afternoon, though, this Dickel do...so to speak."

Had 1.5 fingers of this after some high end scotches - like “fuck scotch, this is the jam- where were you?”, so, IMO I think this is a nice light simple citric whiskey that’s easy to drink and satisfying - in the category of wild turkey 101, buffalo trace, four roses yellow."

1.0,"absolutely horrible.  forgot to get something to drink at work, so I had a shot of Evan black and Dickel to start the night cap.  I started with Evan which I'm used to, but man going down the Dickel 8 is so unpleasant.  I will admit after some aeration the nose has that buttery bourbon sweetness but the taste is just so awful."

3.0,"Appearance: The color, after looking into my glass, was a deep copper. The legs were thin and viscous.

Nose: On the nose I found notes of grains, caramel, vanilla, baked sourdough bread, and a nostalgic smell that reminded me of a bowl of Fruit Loops cereal after you ate it all and drank the milk. A splash of water brightened and sweetened the nose slightly, though it also made it less complex.

Taste: The palate had notes of cornbread, vanilla, baking spices and cinnamon. A splash of water makes it really boring, I don't recommend that.

Finish: The finish was pretty short. There was some heat going down even at 40% ABV. After adding a splash of water it took away the burn but like I said before, it made everything else boring.

Thoughts: It was fun to try a whiskey from the other big player in the Tennessee whiskey category, (Jack Daniel's being the other) however I'm not in love with this product. I'd happily drink this if it were given to me again. But buying a George Dickle product myself in the future, I'd look for the No.12 or the Barrel Select offerings. No.8 wasn't bad though, so George Dickle, thanks! Cheers!"

3.75,"Re-visiting this one after not having it for a while. 
Noticeably lighter in color than the 12 thanks to the lower age and proof. The color of straw with skinny fast moving legs.
NOSE: Light and Delicate with Vanilla, Corn, Hazelnut, and Oak. A little time in the glass brings out Cake Batter and Honey. A touch of the Multi-Vitamin note may be there? or my brain is just accustomed to associating it with Dickel Whisky? 
NEAT: As the Distillr notes suggest, about as straightforward as a whiskey can get. Vanilla Pudding, a little Banana Cream, and a lot of Dusty Oak. Some Honeycomb emerges as well. Almost scotch-like. If the multi-vitamin note is here, it is so light as to not be noticed. It may be that it is more prominent with the added 10 proof points of the No. 12. No burn or harshness on the finish, just a light warming on the way down. The oak note coats the palate and lingers.
SPLASH: Brings the Banana Cream note to the nose. The Vanilla and Oak now completely dominate the palate. Whether its the added water or the time spent in the glass, I am starting to get a little of the ""Flintstone"" vitamin note. 
VERDICT: Every once in a while you get surprised by a Whisk(e)y. This is one of those times. I have had this in the past, but always bypass it in favor of the No. 12. That may be a mistake. The 12 is better, but for a $15-$18 whiskey, this one is hard to beat. The only one I can think of liking better in this price range is the EW BIB. That's good company. When in the mood for an 80 proofer, this and WT81 should be my choice every time. More than $10 less than Jack Daniel's, but infinitely better."

I get the Centrum vitamin thing, it’s weird because once you recognize it you can correlate vitamins and light caramel if that makes sense. It’s enjoyable for an 80 proof whiskey."

3.0,"So when you come across a shelf with knob creek as the most expensive whiskey/bourbon on the top shelf, I chose a known brand I haven’t tried yet. The standard George Dickel. A staple of some whiskey drinkers, I opted for a try at $20 without the fear of overspending on something new to me. A soft warm nose with a strike of oak and possibly cinnamon. The palate is clean and smooth with the oak coming through without really any spice. The finish is delayed but present with a slight burn and again cinnamon or a hint of vanilla. I would say a staple of the industry but light on complexity. Easily a go to for the novice whiskey gentleman. 3.6/5"

Moderate finish of spice and corn sweetness. Not as complex as Blaton's or Stagg, Jr; but, I got 1.75 for $27 pre-tax. How can you argue with that?"

3.0,"Sampling some baby Dickel - George Dickel No.8. Makes me wish I had a bottle of No.12 to do a proper side-by-side. NAS, but reportedly aged between 5 to 7 years. 

Mash Bill: 84% Corn, 8% Rye, 8% Malted Barley (Standard Dickel Mash Bill)
ABV: 40%
Price: $16.99

Nose: Light, sweet corn. Green apple. Malty oak. A bit of black licorice hidden in there. It could be the sugar, char, and minerality are combining to give it that effect but I can’t un-smell it. 

Palate: Tart green apple with a tiny bit of salt at first, followed by honey sweetness (like the little to-go packets of “honey” you get with your takeout), malty vanilla oak, char, and minerals. The tannins want to leap out at you, but they suspiciously mellow out before they get the chance to become overwhelming. I still get faint black licorice again. 

Finish: Sweet and warming, with lots of minerality lingering on the finish. My moniker may make it seem like I have a habit of licking rocks (I don’t) but if you did lick rocks, the finish may taste something like that. 

I much prefer this dram to the Tennessean behemoth that overshadows it. Pretty good VFM, if a little unconventional on the finish.

2.5,I am a big fan of the 12 so wanted to give this a go. Sometimes you want an 80pf so you don't get your face ripped off if you want to have more than needed. This hits the spot in that regard. Its not as good as the 12 but is solid in the low proof class along with WT81(totally agree with BD on this point) Im not gonna rehash tasting notes as they are very similar to the 12 with less developed flavor power and a bit more char cutting through. For the money its good whisky but again the 12 beats it on value as well. This is for when you choose a lower proof to keep the effects in check so to speak. Recommended and good for newbies too.........77/100

3.5,"Vanilla bean in the nose, followed by some of that corn and a peanut component. I have been picking up on a lot of peanut in Bourbons lately, and I don't know if that's an actual flavor or if my taste buds aren't working.

The taste is mild corn that is quickly overshadowed by the charred oak. Just a hint of spicy orange peel and potpourri, another flavor I keep pulling. There is a little heat on the middle of the tongue but it's quite bearable. A droplet or water makes all of this bloom like a crystalizing snowflake.

The finish is molasses, vanilla bean, and that charred wood; you can almost taste each individual ash speck. The char is the game-changer in this one."
