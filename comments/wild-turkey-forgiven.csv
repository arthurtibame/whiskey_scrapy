4.0,"Spicier and bolder than my bottle of Russell Reserve, but with a smooth follow through. The Rye adds a pleasantly sour undertone on the nose and tongue. Think of it like a rye heavy traditional bourbon. Good stuff if you can find it for a fair price."

4.0,"One word... Unique. Although different, this blend was impressive for turkey and carries a lot of the amazing qualities that make turkey great. For $50, great alternate to the well you normally partake in."
3.0,"Batch #303
Nose - Initially a very subtle nose that's masked by quite a bit of ethanol for the proof. Opens up to a hint of vanilla simple syrup, hint of minty herbs, cinnamon, and what I take to be an alcoholic grape gummy bear.
Taste - Thin mouthfeel, light watery vanilla caramel sweetness, hint of lightly bitter sweet mint, mild cinnamon and black pepper spice.
Finish - Lightly drying, faint bitter sweetness like if you tried to ""candy"" a green oak sapling.

5.0,"This is freaking amazing. Definitely a mix of a tradition bourbon with heavy rye notes. It has wonderful spice and a sweetness. 

It starts off very silky and sweet and transforms into a dry spice. It’s so different. And that’s not a bad thing. 

I love this. I’m glad I had the opportunity to get a bottle.

5.0,"If this was legitimately the product of a distillery screw up, then we have a prime example here of Bob Ross' philosophy that there are no mistakes, only ""happy little accidents."" This is the best Wild Turkey product I've had the pleasure to taste. The nose is invitingly fruity - cherry and navel orange - with the right amount of caramel sauce, vanilla ice cream, nuttiness, and spice. This is like dessert in a glass, but it's never cloyingly sweet, either. The palate is rich and expressive, just oozing goodness like pecan pie and ice cream sundaes, with enough spice to stay intriguing. They can forget to change the hose down at Wild Turkey every day and I'd be OK with that if this is the end result."

5.0,"Shocked by the initial complexity of this. Roasted almond, rich and spicy dried fruits, gooey caramel and creaming soda on the nose. (And, in the distant background, hints of clove and maybe mushroom). Hot, spicy sugar in the mouth which lingers through a deep finish. 

A potent and compelling blend. Every time I have some, I love it more."

3.0,"I didn't realize what this was when I first sipped it, expecting a variation on the distillery's bourbon.  To my surprise, this tasted like a rye; in fact, more like a rye than Wild Turkey 101 Rye, which has more of a chameleon quality to its flavor.  Then I googled it and found out that this is a blend of bourbon and rye, along the lines of other maverick whiskies like High West's well-regarded Bourye.  To be honest, I thought this one was a little boring mostly because the bourbon is getting its ass kicked in this blend.  Sure, there's a little vanilla and cherry that's more reminiscent of bourbon in the nose and at times in the palate, but this reads like a rye:  heavy on the spice, dill, and sesame seed.  Perhaps because I was signing up for a more bourbon-like experience, this one left me a little cold."

3.0,"I get hints of caramel and cinnamon on the nose, with a body that’s similar to Russell’s Reserve insofar as that it has an unpleasant industrial flavor. Unlike Russel’s Reserve, the fig and cinnamon flavors balance it out in a pleasant way. Cinnamon flavor carries through to the finish. It’s Autumn themes in my mouth, and I like this one. Dear Wild Turkey: I said some shit about Russell’s Reserve 10 year. I am not sorry. However, after seeing this improvement to a similar flavor, you are... FORGIVEN."

4.5,"2 oz in glen cairn.  This was batch 303 (2nd batch).  

Nose- sugar cookie,vanilla ice cream and cinnamon.  There is also honeycrisp apple, and the floral scent of a blossoming fall apple orchard.

Palate- absolutely delicious!  Somewhat sweet, somwhat sour.  The cinnamon stick and vanilla icecream on the nose are on the palate creating a boozy snickerdoodle.  Then that delicious honeycrisp apply turns to sour apple green jolly rancher fading into an apple cider-like finish.

Finish-  smooth finish (shorter with little burn).  The finish is not pronounced but transitions from palate to finish and then fades gently.  Some may find fault with this as it does not hug or heat you up.  I love the gentle transition from sweet bourbon to spicy rye gently and seemlessly which fades like cider.  Really well done here!

Overall:  This is now one of my favorite Wild Turkey expressions.  It captures those wonderfully sweet and sassy flavors in Russell's bourbon and adds those spicy, puckery tastes from WT rye and then dovetails them into a wonderful ""sweet and sour"" sauce!  Think Highwest Boureye...but better.  The proof is perfect as it is not too hot, or too timid, but just right.  Reminds me of the old reeses peanut butter cup commercial- ""you put your chocolate into my peanut butter!  ""No, you put your peanut butter into my chocolate.""  Everybody wins, and an incredibly tasty creation is born here."

4.0,"This is so darn good. This is a magnificent blend of Bourbon with sweet, creamy notes yet has the baking spice and backbone of a Rye. The proof is low but makes for one heck of a long sipper."
4.0,"Today I found a very dusty old bottle of this in a very small shop in New York City. It looks to be from 2013. This is batch 303 (somehow it’s really just the 2nd of 2 batches). Forgiven has been discontinued for a while now, so let’s see what this extinct product is like.

The nose has that signature Wild Turkey funk (empty dusty peanut can), dusty rye, charred oak, mint, red ripe apples, maple syrup, fresh bread, and slight bubble gum.

The palate has a lighter mouthfeel to it and a little spicy. I get rye, peanut can, vanilla, barrel char, and shoe leather.

The finish is nice and on the longer since of medium. There is some subtle vanilla/marshmallow notes along with rye/mint that hang out on the finish.

This is a nice change up from other Wild Turkey products that I have come to love. It’s very easy to drink. It’s definitely in the same family, but adds some a little more rye than the others do (aside from WT Rye, or 101 Rye)."

4.75,"First Tasting over ice cube: really nice! Good flavors and you don’t taste the rye until the end, and it finishes it out well. Neat next time

Second Tasting neat: moving the rating up! I really like this bourbon, it right at the top for me. The little rye finish is perfect, but you don’t even notice until the very end. Starts out sweet, smooth through the middle. I gotta try it a couple more times but Blanton’s has got some company at the top of my leaderboard"
