3.75,Spicy yet smooth finish. Mild vanilla nose. Really solid Kentucky bourbon. Would buy again.

4.0,"Neat. Hints of oak up front.  Lots of fruit.  Apples and cherries.  Little vanilla.  Baking spices mold it all together.  

Nice mouth feel.  Doesn’t come across as thin, but it is light on the tongue.  Vanilla cream upfront on the palate.  Those spices and fruits come punching on the taste.  Carry through to decent legs.  

It’s delicious.  Unfair to compare to 1833, but it does lack 1833’s depth.  A lot of the nose and tasting notes rhyme with 1833, but are muted by comparison.  This is arguably more approachable than 1833.  It’s an approachable, delicious, but a little shallow MGP.  Looking forward to trying this again when it opens up a bit."

4.5,"The ghosts did it. They got a bottle in my local liquor store. 3 to be exact, and I got one of em. In the past I was very impressed by their single barrel Sauternes finish. I hope this is the beginning of a beautiful thing between Boone County and my honey hole.

Nose is very sugary, in a good way. I get syrup, cane sugar, and mild caramel. Delicious.

Body is juicy. I get tangerine and salted caramel. I really enjoy that combo, and it just makes your mouth water, wanting more.

Finish, on the other hand, is dry. The salt lingers and is joined by a mild spice, something like baking powder.

This is genuinely good. This small batch has the swagger of a single barrel and I have nothing but high hopes for the future of this 5 year old distilling company."

4.0,"Nicely balanced. Smooth up front, but rye spice grows nicely on the tongue towards the finish."

3.5,"Very light nose.  Mild spice pallet and pleasant medium spice finish that has some length.  Gets a bit more nose with a bit of ice, maybe cinnamon?"
4.0,Sweet vanilla with a smooth warming oak finish
