3.5,"Seems very one dimensional and harsh. I am not enjoying the flavor, though the finish does last pretty long. I wouldn’t buy this again at half the price."

4.75,"Tasting- 2 oz. In glen cairn neat, and then 2 oz with 2 drops of water.

Nose:  Caramel, vanilla, cherry, and marshmallow with oak and light sawdusty woodshop.

Palate:  A butterscotch bomb!  Tastes like those yummy yellow candies and caramel-vanilla cremes. Their is oak in the background, and a hint of nutmeg on the finish.  This is a liquid candy bowl

Finish:  Medium and warming.  That butterscotch stays on the tongue and leaves you wanting more with a hint of nutmeg to round it all out..

Overall-  Big fan of this one!  Super sippable and has all the flavors of grandma's candy dish without cloying sweetness.  The texture is velvety smooth and buttery.  I love what Michter's does with the low 103 entry proof.  It adds incredible texture and layers of flavor without all of the water.  This may have been a 5/5 for me if it was higher in proof.  I am not complaining about it at all, it is jist that water seemed to thin it a bit, and I like to dial my bourbon in to my liking.  That said....the 94.4 proof from the bottle hit the spot perfectly.  $130 is a high pricetag to pay, but if you got it, do not hesitate to use it to grab a spectacular bourbon."

4.5,"Lots of caramel, vanilla, and oak on the nose. Hits your tongue warm, soft, light and buttery. Flavors of deep caramel and slight spice. Very smooth. Long finish."
