4.0,"Dalmore is one of the best whiskies a man can get. I personally love everything they do and i recommend it. Regalis, not the best of this distillery, still is a great great dram. 

Bottled at 40%abv with a beautiful reddish old oak color.

On the nose is simply sublime, outstanding. Notes: caramelized apple, brown sugar, cremè bruleé, almonds and cotton candy. Its an angel's touch.

On the palate all the sweetness mixes with some bold notes. Creme brulee, toasted sugar, maple honey, hot oak, spices and a bonfire finish which is lovely but not that long.

Overall i give this beauty an 86 over 100, highly recommended if you are in a duty free, since it is only for the travel retail market. Cheers!"

4.0,1L bottle from the Dalmore Distillery.  Very citrusy smell.  Nice light finish with this being only 40% abv.
