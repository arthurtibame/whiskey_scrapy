4.0,"Nose: vanilla, pear, citrus, lemon zest, whitecurrant, heather, dried apples, mint, camphor. Taste: dried apples and apricots, hint of creme brûlée, cacao powder, later sage and oaky bitter. Finish: bittersweet, sage, a little smoky, peppery. Overall: fair 90/100, a worthy dram."

4.0,"Fantastic presentation, I appreciate the vintage statement, natural color and non-filtration. Sweet dried fruits, honey and slightly sour melon on the nose. The taste has a gentle start, into notes of honey malt and fruit. Followed by a long sustaining slight spicy and sour finish. A rewarding and interesting dram specially when you spend enough time to get to know it."

3.5,"The concept of vintage bottlings with a craft presentation is a prominent feature of Balblair. Distilled in 2003 and matured in ex-bourbon casks for 12 years, the aroma of this young Single Malt accentuates crisp apples, salted caramel and blossom honey. Tastewise, expect a roller coaster ride of zesty, sour and at times unpleasantly dry flavors. Is it possible to distill lemons? Bitter oakiness, thyme and hints of sweet ginger accompany the short finish. Malt beginners beware! This Highland whisky is demanding and most likely not to everybody's taste.

4.0,"Balblair's Johnny-come-lately is this offering, bottled at 10 years old, but packing a decent punch for its youthful demeanor. Purely from 2nd fill bourbon casks, there's no surprise that bourbon notes like vanilla, chocolate, and coconut come to the forefront on the nose. On the palate, there's an almost surprising amount of substance - while refreshing, this is not a light, shrinking violet of a whisky. Instead a rather full, oily mouthfeel yields milk chocolate, vanilla, pineapple, light citrus, and white pepper notes. Really quite pleasant."

3.0,"It's surprisingly complex for a young whisky, and its flavour profile is sufficiently well-balanced - what begins as fruity somehow becomes quite floral at the finish. The orange zest and vanilla become ______ (lilac?), so that from beginning to end it's all satisfying. Not bad."
