4.0,Cask strength 58%.  I like to add a few drops of water . It allows in this case to enjoy the flavours more by reducing the alcohol strength. A little salty. Stays very long in the mouth. The smell resembles the taste.
5.0,I fell in love after my first taste. Just finished my first bottle and bought two more. Also just found out it's a young Lagavulin. The sherry cast adds the sweetness to the peat and rich smoke.

5.0,"Fra smaking for 16 dager siden: Vi snakker sjølukt, tang og tare. Eksplosjon i kjeften. Ettersmaken forandrer seg fort. Den umiddelbare ettersmaken er veldig digg, men klarer ikke å sette fingeren på hva det smaker. Nyyyydelig!"
5.0,"30 drops of water, and the sea appears!"
3.5,Smoky and with strong character Some water need to be added But generally nice dram for peated whisky lovers
4.0,Like tasting bacon burning on a campfire while sipping a little medicine :) this is a punch in the face whiskey sweet and smooth for cask strength tastes a little young kind of like laphroig select or quarter cask if it were cask strength. Probably the most affordable cask strength in bc Canada besides Naddura so definitely worth trying if you like peat and a pinch in the face
3.0,"Very very peaty. Poured it, left the room, come back and taught I had turf in my kitchen"
3.5,"This was originally posted on Barreled 3/1/18 from a Flaviar sampler.

Some say it’s a 5-6 year old Lagavulin. Some say it’s whatever  (cheapest) barrels are available on the independent market. Still others swear that it’s from Laphroaig. Whatever it is, the only thing that’s certain is that it’s from Islay and we call it The Ileach. (H/T Top Gear!)

The Ileach Cask Strength is an independent bottling from an unknown Islay distillery. It’s a nice medium amber in the glass and is bottled at a hearty 58% ABV. It has no age statement. In the glass it’s a medium amber that leaves a nice oily coating, leaving lots of long thin legs. 

The nose of this whisky is pretty tame considering it’s strength. There’s very little alcohol burn; floral peat, briny sea spray, light citrus. Little to no smoke. Some dark malt tones after some time in the glass. Water has little to no effect on the nose. Kind of underwhelming. 

In the mouth it’s a whole ‘nother thing! There’s heat of course (did I mention it’s 58% ABV?); sharp but not harsh. Smoke, oily mouthfeel, phenols. Some bitter chocolate. Very light vanilla sweetness, almost unnoticeable. Water tames the heat but has little other effect. 

The finish has LOTS of smoke! Medium length, ashy, BBQ meat. Very reminiscent of Laphroaig. Unfortunately, water kills the finish. This whisky is available online in the $50-60 range, but not in the U.S. This makes it a possible alternative to drams like Laphroaig Cask Strength if all you’re looking for is smoke and ABV. Unfortunately there’s not much else to this dram. I enjoyed this sample but would not go looking for it. 3.5/5. Cheers!"
