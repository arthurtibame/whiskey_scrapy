This single malt is a sourced spirit aged in bourbon casks and then finished in Camus cognac barrels. The finishing is done in a warehouse on the island and try as I might I could not detect the maritime waft that the rep tried to convince me was there. I did register apples, pears, and floral notes though. The taste was typical but tasty - vanilla, shortbread, and lightly fruity.

Lambay island is a privately owned island 3 miles off the coast of County Dublin, passed down through generations of Barings barons (they of banking fame). It is known as a home for a vast amount of seabirds including a circus of puffins, which feature on the label. But it is also, more peculiarly, home to a mob of wild wallabies introduced in the 50s and added to by a donation of surplus wallabies from Dublin Zoo over 30 years ago."

This is a bit of a mongrel due to the time in the cognac.  A very light, fruity dram.

Apparently, the spirit spends around 6-months in the cognac casks and the whisky itself is around the 5.5 year mark.

There is some saline as it develops, but overall I get the plummy sweetness from the cognac more than anything.

The aftertaste is quite long and warm.  I’d certainly come back to this one.

(Like the small batch, I had a bit of an allergic reaction to this one and couldn’t stop sneezing)!"
