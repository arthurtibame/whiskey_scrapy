5.0,"This whisky was triple-distilled in 1990, and bottled at cask strength (53.8% abv) in 2011, 18 years after the distillery was mothballed.

Color is beautiful gold, viscous. Nose is floral, delicate, with hints of fresh apples, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a hint of vanilla on the back. Palate is smooth and fresh, with lemon zest, spice, vanilla ice cream, and apples. Finish is long and has a fresh, floral character with distinct vanilla notes. 

A splash of water opens up more character in this dram. It becomes very well balanced, yet maintains its floral nature. Nose opens more citrus notes, palate gains hard candy characteristics with barberry notes, and finish gets some caramel notes. Some more water makes this dram superb. Finish remains long and complex, with just a hint of smoked salmon note on the back that is often so characteristic of older drams. Too bad we wouldn’t see much of this in the future, it’s a truly superb and very complex whisky."

4.5,"Nose - (w/o water) Light floral honey, baked apple skins, light toasted oak (w/ water) pretty much the same

Taste - (w/o water) Lightly tannic/drying, intense sweet dark apple/pear cider, oak aged sweet riesling/moscato, fruity honey (w/ water) less drying, hint of bitter apple skin emerges, otherwise mostly the same

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering pleasant honey/apple/pear sweet, light but very pleasant (w/ water) Surprisingly more heat/tingle, pleasant fruity honey, sparkling white wine sweet

Score - 92/100

Final Thoughts - So the nose on this one was a bit boring, but once it hit the palate it was just great. It's not the most complex dram, but it has such great balance. I will have to admit that this is best enjoyed at full proof as I think a bit of water brings out a hint of bitterness that isn't there neat. This is a very nice spring/summery dram that doesn't really punch you in the face but brings a nice, very well-balanced fruity/honey taste to the table. Amazing mouthfeel and great finish in that it lingers just long enough for you to want more.

4.5,"Closed in 1993 and soon to be revived by Ian Macleod, Rosebank remains one of Scotland's most iconic distilleries. This 21-year-old Special Release was matured in refill American oak and bottled at 55.3% ABV (bottle no. 3579). Biscuity and cereal-driven, the aroma unfolds with citrus cream, pears and a lovely herbal complexity. On the palate, floral and slightly bitter notes intermingle with parsley, barley sugar and a touch of mojito. Minty freshness and lemon zest mark the clean and very elegant finish. A much-missed Lowlander with unrivaled character!
