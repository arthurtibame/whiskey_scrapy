4.25,"This was the first of 10 whiskies I sampled last night at an Adelphi event. I’ll try to post brief notes on them all. We started the night with this very old grain whisky, the likes of which I don’t think I’ve had before. The nose was like a top-class rye: grassy, with a hint of mint. The palate was sweet caramel with a long creamy finish. Delicious! Tasted blind I would have pegged this for a very good bourbon."
