3.0,"Smooth, sweet, not real smokey over all based on ratings but still too much for me"
3.75,"I do not have too many blends, but I found this one for a good price.  The aroma is a little fruity, but mellow.  On the palate, there's a little peat with more fruity flavor and chocolate.  The finish is light a a little short, but I do not mind that.  I think this is a good value for the price of an 18 year blend, around $75"
3.75,"Not much smell, smooth and light taste with some peat, some fumes afterward. Interesting and tasty but doesn't quite fit my typical pick"

4.25,"The nose is rich with dark chocolate, tabaco, apples, smoke, and vanilla. 

More smoke and dark chocolate on the palate along with apples, pears, and brown sugar. The finish is oily with tabaco and pepper.

This is an enjoyable blended malt with flavors like a good maduro cigar. Not the most complex or flavorful scotch you can find, but it is one of the best values you’ll find with an 18 year age statement."
3.75,Bought for sequoia trip and the cap broke. Then brought to Ryan’s 34th birthday.

4.25,"beautiful blended scotch. very balanced, state of the art. On the nose you get a friendly aroma filled with vanilla, cream, herbal and flower notes. on the palate starts a little sweet, like caramel, butterscotch and maybe chocolate, dark chocolate. Then the sweetness fades into an spicy note but very gentle and balanced, with a tiny bit of bitterness. the after taste is also medium and gratifiying. To put it in a word, this whisky is balanced. lovely dram i just had. i almost forgot. there is orange somewhere too"
