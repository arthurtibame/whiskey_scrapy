5.0,Great end of the day single malt.  Taste best over ice.  Brings out the rich fruity flavors.

3.0,Tasty on it's own. Funky from the pot still. Milk chocolate nose. Body is sweet but also tart/astringent. Milk chocolate aftertaste that goes for hours.

2.0,"Simple, sweet, and kinda boring. It desperately needs water in order to turn down the sweetness and add summer barrel notes. Not a huge fan."

2.5,"Nose - a hint of vanilla , some cane sugar and maybe marshmallow. Taste - a hint of sweet vanilla a little tart. Finish has a little spice but kinda short. Overall it tastes halfway between a scotch and a bourbon, which may have been the goal, but I think just ends up in a no mans land with tase. Just ok overall."

0.25,"One of the very worst spirits I’ve ever tasted.  I’m sure someone out there would like it, but nobody I know; I poured it down the drain, literally. Giving it a quarter star because I didn’t spew."
3.25,A little on the spicy side.
