2.5,Hard to believe i'm drinking the same whiskey as whiskeyjug and worldwhiskey. It reminds me a bit of the terrible Brenne whiskey I had which had a candyfloss type flavour. This is really not good. Sweet artificial chai latte spicey whiskey. It is well balanced in terms of ethanol and flavor but man urgh I really do not like this. If you are a sweet chai latte type person you may love this not me.
4.5,"Brilliantly executed. Aroma is deep and layered with beautiful nuances of tropical fruits and delicate notes of baking spices dancing among the heavier oak and malt notes; Palate is a deeper, more multifaceted, delivery of similar notes paired with a maltier backbone; Finish is warm and fades out fruity and spicy."
5.0,"Great stuff with notes of vanilla, honey, caramel, butterscotch, floral, citrus, tropical fruit, and white chocolate with a smooth creamy mouthfeel."
