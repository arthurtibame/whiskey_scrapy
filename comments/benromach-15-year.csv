4.0,Warming Speyside. I liked the light charcoal character with the sherry and vanilla flavors. Kinda reminded me of a highland park with less tobacco flavors. A little water and boom comes the chocolate and coffee flavor. My new favorite Speyside.

4.0,"A good but in some ways disappointing whisky, especially if your love the Benromach Organic. It's slightly peated and sherried to the nose (it's hard to discern more than that) with grilled meat added to the palate. The finish is good and has legs. I wish I could sound more enthusiastic, but I think part of my problem is also the fact that, in many ways, this whisky really comes across as a toned down imitation of a Lagavulin (the Distiller's Edition) or perhaps an Ardbeg. It's nice, but I'd rather just reach out for an Islay."

4.5,"Nose: A gentle fruity smoke teases the nose - someone is baking orange cake in a wood-fired stove in a cottage nearby. A sunny path winds its way down to the beach, with orange blossoms and fragrant herbs on the wayside. You can smell wild honey and pollen on the wind, and the scent of flowering apricots and tangellos from the nearby orchards. Your friend in the leather jacket passes you a bag of freshly baked spicy ginger cookies. The path crests the sand dunes as you smell the breakers rolling in, and a waft of oil and sandalwood reaches out to you from the pier.

Palate: Sweet soft citrus floods the palate, accompanied by memories of smoky tobacco - that sweet, mild Cuban cigar last night. Anise, cinnamon, rosemary, and rockmelon burst into your thoughts accompanied by a cooling mint highlight.

Finish: Long, bittersweet and herbal. Cane juice, sweet oranges and spearmint flow into the distance, with a final reminiscence of smoke.

""Kull wahad"", as Muad'Dib would say. After some of the mundane malts I've been tasting lately this is almost too good to be true. A beautifully engaging nose and a palate that recalls and delivers on the promise of those aromas, followed by a finish that is modestly sublime. Add just a small dash of water to open it up, but it does not need to rest for long.

I have only one more word to say about this whisky, and Benromach in general: ""Glengyle"". Benromach is now officially in my list of top 10 favourite Scottish distilleries. The Islay old guard distilleries had better get their houses in order.

""Excellent"" : 4.5 stars"

4.5,"Information: le 15 ans de Benromach est une édition de la gamme récurrente. Le prix de détail est affiché ici à 115 CAD. La distillerie utilise seulement des futs de premiers remplissage. Le 15 ans est un mix de fut de bourbon et de sherry. On reconnait la signature de Benromach à la touche de fumé harmonisé aux arômes vanillé ou fruité. 

Nez: Miel puissamment sucré, raisin juteux, une touche de cannelle et d'agrumes. Ce parfum! Wow!

Bouche: savoureux! Un équilibre aromatique naviguant entre le sucre, les fruits frais, des fleurs et un sel. Le sherry explose en bouche de façon fabuleuse en fruit et en épice (me fait pensé un peu à un Glendronach sur ce point). 

Final: sucré-salé, fumé subtile. Équilibré du début à la fin. 

Overall: Pour ma part, c'est un 4 en 4 pour Benromach (Peat Smoke, Chateau Cissac, 100 proof et ce 15 ans). J'ai du plaisir avec ces bouteilles et le 15 ans n'en fait pas exception. Ce 15 ans est d'un équilibre parfait et ne peux que plaire aux amateurs de Sherry-fruité. 92%"
4.25,"Nez sucré et gourmand, très aromatique.
Attaque légère qui monte rapidement, très belle impression en bouche, des arômes de fruit confit et de chocolat, c'est excellent.
La finale reste dans la bouche, légère mais sucrée, c'est excellent."

4.5,"The statement on the bottle couldn't be more true.

This is a true classic Speyside in every sense of the words and after trying the imperial proof which is also great for a 10 year old malt, I was compelled to try this and my god what a solid malt.

Color: Rich caramel brown that took in lots of the wood and is just mesmerizing.

On the nose: Hints of toffee with slight coffee bean undertones while a series of caramel aromas begin to reveal themselves after a few good sniffs with air and straight in the glass.

Down the hatch: This is where the magic of this malt begins to show it self. The taste is pure speyside and harkens to other popular counterparts like the Macallan and Balvenie of similar age rages. The oak here is strong, but the flavor is layered and lasts a while with a touch of sweet vanilla while the finish is silky smooth.

Verdict: If you see it, get it. It would be hard to find a Speyside of this age range under $100 USD that punches in the same taste class as both Balvenie and Macallan.

Such a job well done and not shocked since it is under the care of Gordon and Macphail after all."

4.5,"I’m drinking this tonight in London with my father, who bought a bottle after Whisky Exchange crowned it whisky of the year. Benromach is near the top of my bang-for-your-buck list and this is perhaps the best I’ve had from them. The nose is a little shy but the taste is a beautiful mix of butterscotch and peat, not too sweet or too smoky. The finish goes on and on, the caramel flavors twisting with the spiciness of the smoke. For 50 pounds, a bargain."

4.25,Really spicy and sweet up front with malt and toasted barley—almost too aggressive—but quickly levels out into a really nice balance of smoke and peat that works for both. The lingering flavor is a little like green wood; I didn’t taste the mint or orange. Adding water dropped spice and sweetness but brought out the smoke.
3.75,"2oz pour

Sample rating: +5.
I compared this side by side with a slightly cheaper Lagavulin 16... and I would give that dram a slight edge at +5.5.

Look.  This is a fine lightly peated, well-balanced Scotch that I would not be upset at tasting.  But it's ~100-110 USD in my parts, and it's on the fringes of purchasability at that price, especially when I can get a better whisky in the Lagavulin 16 for 30 bucks less.

This is such a pleasant and refined hickory smoke on the nose.  The balance on the palate is amazing with Speyside fruitiness mixed with creamy caramel and an obvious, but not overpowering smoke.  It just does not have the rewarding Islay finish for rainy days, and drops off quite quickly after swallowing.

Comparing within the same distillery: the Benromach 10 Imperial Proof is cheaper and better.  I would buy that instead."

4.25,"Representing speyside findhorn river

Nose: malty, light peat and smoke, oak, orange cream, caramel sneaks in later. Later more sweet fruit. Sweet and smoky. Mmmm later a little burnt caramel. 

Body: smooth, firm, medium and oily

Palate: yum! Starts with oak, fruitcake and vanilla cake. Slight cinnamon spice

Finish: Love love love the late smoke, reminds me of a springbank 15 in that manner. Medium, warming. 

Note: really well balanced fruity sherry nose with sweet bourbon and smoky finish. This is excellent! Really easy to drink but has complexity that slows you down to appreciate it. Yum."

4.5,"Where this really shines is the nose. I get a lot of sweet grassy/hay qualities, like you might smell after rain. There is orange but not the acidic tartness. Think mandarins/clementines, followed by black cherries. What peat is there is faint like oiled wood, rather than a bonfire.

Sweet on the palate, but not cloying. Some juniper/evergreen botanical flavors, subtle salty tang, cherry and pineapple, and a mild vegetal peat.

Mild finish with the sherry barrel notes coming through.

This is delicious and near perfect. but I have to ding it a few notches as the cost has crept up to $120-130 in my neck of the woods. But is beautifully balanced."
5.0,"Wow! Håndtappet på sherry og bourbon som gir både kokos og tropisk ananas ved første sniff. Andre gang er det mer røyk, brent tre, tang, hvit sjokolade og appelsinskall. Meget sammensatt og flott aroma med klare toner.

Bredt og mykt anslag med en følelse av toffee og salt karamell. Silkemyk og lang med nydelig integrert varme og bitt. Skikkelig chewy og som en karamell på  bålet ved sjøen. Beste whisky jeg har hatt. Evaporerer I munnen med nydelig frukter og lengde"
