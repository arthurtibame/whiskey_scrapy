4.5,"Nose - Raisins, figs, fig newtons, dark honey, caramel, flamed orange zest, chocolate, hint of grape soda

Taste - Raisins, dark apple cider, sweet peppery heat, ginger, figs, caramel, hint of orange, lightly drying

Finish - Lingering fruity heat, syrupy raisins, light metallic like from that of canned fruit, hint of fruity bitter fruit stems/vines

Score - 91/100

Final Thoughts - This one didn't disappoint. The nose was incredible and lasts a very long time. I think the slightly higher proof helps with that without being too punchy with the alcohol vapors. The nose just keeps on going. Once it hits the palate it isn't as complex as the nose, but is still quite tasty. You can tell it's a younger spirit as it doesn't have that thick leathery mouthfeel of older Scotches, but is still quite nice. This is something I can see myself sipping on when I want a very nicely sherried dram. Finish could use a bit of work, but it's still quite pleasant.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes

Would I buy a bottle? - Yes"
3.75,"Citrus, with a slightly sweet overtone, limited nose, but pleasant.  Medium finish with light peppery notes."
3.25,Sherry and dried fruits/currants on the nose. Strong finish but iron-like sourness on the palate. Beautiful nose.

4.0,"I was very excited to try this new line from Glengoyne.  It has great fruity flavors with a nice oak finish.  It was a bit harsh on the first couple sips so I added a little water, let it sit and open up and by the time I got to the end of my glass maybe 30 mins later it had really come to life and became delightfully smooth and flavor packed. Definitely going to look for chapter 2 next year and grab another bottle of this before people discover how great it is!"

3.25,"While it is good, it's probably not worth the risk of entering that dimly lit liquor store. There could be a host of undead just waiting for a poor hapless soul to devour.

Smokey up front, red fruits for finish, but everything is muted."
3.25,Let it air as long as Queen Elizabeths reign and together with a good amount of water it becomes a good dram.
2.75,"Different, much alkohol taste. Needs alot of water to let it expand and give more notes. Would get higher rating if it was like when you water it down."
3.25,The most interesting thing about this whisky is the official review. Thijs Klaverstijn is a master at dissecting and describing whisky. Their description word for word sums up my experience and end result. Hard pass. But I will google more on Thijs a man to know more about I think...

4.0,"Bottle half-filled, open a month
malt, chocolate and banana - on the nose.
Berries, Figs, Dates, Chocolate - on the taste.
spicy chocolate and astringency - on the finish

Value: Very cool of Glengoyne to come out with a high ABV NAS. I wont be collecting this one, as others do with the Macallan Edition series. I think this Legacy 1 is trying to capitalize on the ""Gotta catch 'em all - Pokemon"" whiskey lover. Its a good fruity, chocolaty and strong whiskey at a fair price.

P.S.  I have thought about buying another, as this bottle is almost empty - unconsciously enjoyed more in life, than in this review."
2.0,"Colour: golden 
Nose : tart apple cider vinegar offset by some banana
Palate : wood and spice and not much else 
Finish: is short dry with wood and spice

If it was chapter one of a book not sure I’d bother finishing it!"

4.0,"This one needs a splash of water to open it up, does wonders."
3.0,"Apple on the nose. Taste of lemon, wood and Carmel. Not bad."
2.75,"Apple pie sweetness on the nose, nice body, little harsh on the finish. Day 15, 2019"
4.0,Really strong on the nose with fruity tangs varying from apples to fruits. Down the hatch it’s a bit hot which is indicative of a youger scotch but overall execution is fantastic.
