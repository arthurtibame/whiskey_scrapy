4.0,"I love the Komagatake series from Mars. The differences between each variant are clear and interesting, but they maintain a good cohesion between them that allow them to be indented as a set. Precision whiskey crafting, so much fun to taste and compare."

5.0,"A smooth whisky with notes of caramel, berries, cereal, and spices."
5.0,"The clean and subtle smokiness is super addictive. You can tell this has some young whiskey in it. I actually quite enjoy the oiliness, because it doesn’t burn when I let it fill my mouth and hold it there. The palate might be a bit thin, but the finish is very clean. A bit hard to find, but I highly recommend it."
