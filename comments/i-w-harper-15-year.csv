4.0,"Oooooweeeee this one is hot.  I like it, surprisingly. This one slaps me and says ""Wake up!"" Fun with a great bouquet and a flavour profile that is smooth, gentle and yet complex. I love the finish too. Such a lovely dram. Had to import my own bottle as I haven't seen it anywhere in Australia except in my collection. Thank you Mr. Barsoum."

3.0,"After a couple of tries it still reminds me too much of Elijah Craig 12 Year (my review of that one: 'Okay, but it's almost too mellow while also not being all that smooth. I prefer more spice.') And for the price I would definitely go with Elijah Craig, though I'm also more likely to just drink something else. Maybe I don't like older bourbons (I do prefer regular Bulleit to the ten-year variety.)"

3.0,"Purchased at the Bulleit Distillery in Louisville. If drank from a traditional bourbon glass the nose is quite acidic/citrus and gives way to softer almond notes. Once on the palette, the flavor is well-balance between Oak, almond, vanilla. The finish is mild with a strong vanilla closing."

4.0,"On first nosing, I sensed a rubber-cement or glue adhesive quality and very little else.  On arrival, pepper, rye with the corn sweetness. The palate was rewarded where the nose was not.  Two different sensations that confuse.  As you continue, the soft texture with the sweetness and rye finishes slightly oaky.  Overall, a decent whiskey.  However, my sampling was small and need to revisit.  I am unsure if it is worthy of an $80+ price tag, but definitely worth a try. [87/100][Tasted: 7/10/15]."

3.0,The nose is very attractive with sweet Carmel and vanilla. On the palate the you find an initial burst of sweet sugar followed quickly by stone fruit. The finish is slightly quick and drying. I find that the oak is a little two biting in the back of the palate.

4.0,"Took a while to find this one, finally found it in Covington, LA for $56. It likes to breath abit before tasting. For me the first nose was hot giving way the usual suspects of oak and vanilla. The palate is where the 15 years really shines through. The first hit is a nutty sweetness followed by spice and a long peppery finish. As scarce as this is, I will be picking up a couple more bottles for sure. More balanced than the 8 yr, both are good well priced bourbons.

Much fuller and flavorful, airtime has really affected the juice. More butterscotch this time around. 9/1/17
This looks like a perfume bottle, so now I smell perfume. Oaky perfume, with caramel. That's how it tastes as well. Smooth and light. Thin mouthfeel. This is a new bottle, so I'm expecting it to open up. Similar to my previous bottle, yet different. 8/1/18"

3.0,"I received a few bourbons from John (a fellow Michigander with a love for whisky who is not on this app) in a little trade a few weeks ago. This I. W. Harper 15 year old is the first of them. As all Kentucky straight bourbons are, this is natural color, a nice mahogany. Bottled at 43% ABV and most likely chill filtered. 

The nose is fairly soft and begins with mint. Oak and soft fruits. Apples and bananas but not much else as far as fruit goes. A light corn sweetness with some caramel and butterscotch. It almost feels like a less sweet Canadian whisky. A little vanilla with cinnamon and some dark chocolate and orange peel. 

The palate is a bit harsh with an alcoholic twinge. Bitter oak tannins, walnuts and almonds. Cherry syrup, bananas, corn and mint. Honestly I wasn’t able to get much more than that out of it. Maybe some butterscotch. 

Light bodied mouthfeel that is thin with a light oiliness and on the dry side. 
Medium length finish, oak, vanilla and slightly metallic. 

It’s hard to look a gift horse in the mouth, but this was surprisingly bad for a 15 year old bourbon. It’s not without its merits, but at $70 a bottle it’s shortcomings are even more apparent. There’s no real complexity to it. I’m giving this a 2.75 and I think that’s more than fair given the less than stellar quality at a premium price. 
Cheers"

Harper was marketed almost exclusively in japan for years and has only recently come back to the states. I can see why it was a good choice for showcasing American distilling."
2.0,"Okay, I know bourbon is a ""personal choice"" and people have really liked this one.  However, I was expecting more complexity with this one being as it is old enough to get its Learner's Permit to drive.  It came in with the  expected oak notes, but it was missing something else to give it a real robustness I look for with a very well aged bourbon.  I guess it is just not my personal taste which is okay.  ""To each one their own,"" I say. You might like it."

Personal Rating: 7/10
Notes: Absolutely beautiful bottle of whiskey, and being James Bond’s preferred drink is pretty cool too (in the books). Aesthetics aside, this is a very refreshing pour. The flavor is very fruit heavy for it makes this a great choice for a warm evening. I’ve seen a lot of people compare this to other Diageo offerings such as Forged Oak (another 15 year) and Barterhouse (20 year), but the I. W. Harper doesn’t have the oak presence of the others. It is there, but I only really live it up in the finish. I will say, out of the I. W. Harper offerings, I prefer the flavor of the standard for regular everyday sipping, but I think the 15 year is a great choice too. I definitely recommend using the 15 year for your classic bourbon cocktails like an Old Fashioned or Manhattan, it would be perfect!"
5.0,"I've had my eye on this Bourbon for a while, but due to the mixed reviews and the $80 price point I have always passed. Today however my local liquor store dropped the price to $54.99, so at that price I decided to take the leap. After all a 15 yr age stated Kentucky Bourbon from an established distillery (Bernhiem) for under $60 is hard to pass up.
It's interesting to note this Bourbon shares the same mashbill (86% corn, 8% malted barley and 6% rye) and distillery as most of the Orphan Barrel line. I am a fan of some of there Bourbon's, but really dislike the Forged Oak which is also a 15 yr old. Way too much oak on that Bourbon.
On to the tasting:
Upon entry you have a lot of floral and citrus notes. Orange and Grapefruit peel. You also get some red fruits as well. It's sweet but not in traditional brown sugar and vanilla sense. You get some clove, tobacco and a spearmint note on the mid pallette and at last the oak appears on the finish with some brown sugar notes. The finish lingers and you get a menthol feel on your tongue with a fading spearmint taste. There is a surprising amount of heat, but everything is wonderfully in balance.
I forgot to mention this is only 43% abv! This is by far the most robust and complex low proof Bourbon I have ever had. To be honest, I think the proof of perfect as it keeps the oak in check for such old stock. This is far better than the Forged Oak and on par with the great Barterhouse! 
For what I paid, this is a 5/5. For the typical $80 it goes for I would rate it a 4/5. Still a solid buy. Really lovely effort"

If I decided to mix my wife’s Mazola cooking oil with the remnants of every one of my unused cologne bottles from the early 1980’s...you’d have I.W. Harper 15.
I’d love to say it’s “floral-forward”, but that’s beating around the bush. It’s Drakkar Noir and I simply can’t get it off my tongue.
That being said, it has a nice mouthfeel and one might be able to convince themselves that they’re tasting a “fruity bouquet” with hints of vanilla instead.
Whatever it is you’re tasting, I think this one deserves a spot in your library simply because of its “uniqueness”. 3.65."

Very nice Decanter style bottle is pure icing on the cake for this fine dessert. Have to say Kentucky Straight Bourbons like this have an awful lot to offer for the money. Usually not a fan of it but I love the mint on the finish...with mango and coconut as well ---  a true dessert. The burn and mist is just right with this proof making this an anytime Bourbon. Can see why the Japanese fell in love with this label and am very happy the US is finally seeing some of it back in the States. Can't wait to share this with my tasting group.

                                        Edit 8/20/'18 -  Just ordered 2 more bottles after returning to this for a taste from the original which was getting to the bottom third. This whiskey is getting scarce but found a good source at very near the original price paid above. Of course shipping adds some but that is the price of scarcity and distance. Have been so busy lately delving into Scotch, Irish and other American Whiskeys, I forgot what a joy it is to have a sweet Bourbon like this to have with even a simple sandwich for lunch. I'll note it again: 86 proof makes this a neat only, fire-proof sipping anytime whiskey. Anything else in the glass is simply not needed. Cheers!"

4.5,Just tried this over the holidays and this is a great bourbon! The nose is absolutely packed with fruit and the finish has a nice bit of heat and oak with a bit of caramel at the end. It was fantastic served neat and didn’t need water/ice like some of its similarly priced competitors.

4.75,"Incredible bourbon here. Nose of vanilla, nectarine, oak. Comes through with a moderate alcohol burn and mild spice kick. Finishes a little watery, not leaving much of an oily coating, but a really nice finish that doesn't fade too quickly. The nose might suggest it's sweeter than it is, but everything is very well balanced. It sort of reminds me of Basil Hayden in the sense that it's not a stout bourbon, but a very balanced one with complexity and some delicate citrus and caramel flavors.

Some people actually advised me against this, but I'm so glad I took the chance on Distiller's reviews because I love this bourbon. It's a real high quality bourbon in my opinion. It's great straight, but I like a single piece of ice in my glass. The bottle looks fancy, but what's inside is what counts. In this case, the bottle is indicative of the quality you're getting. I like everything about this bourbon."

2.75,"Tasted this a little while back (not my bottle) so I don't have detailed notes. 

This one surprised me, not at all what I was expecting from a 15-year old KY bourbon. Sweet and herbal/floral both on the nose and palate, not nearly as much oak influence as I would expect for the age. Mouthfeel was thin, but it had a nice mint-chocolate finish.

I think this would have benefited from a higher proof. It's just too thin at 86, and a higher ABV would have balanced the sweetness and hopefully added some complexity.  Should make for an easy sipper for anybody new to whiskey, though."

4.25,"Tasting neat.

Nose is of moderate intensity.  Sweet with mild musty wood, mint, red apple with a
 hint of varnish/acetone burn (fresh bottle).  Taste is slightly sweet and smooth, molasses, botanicals, wood, bark cinnamon, walnut, with a tart, medium, dry finish.  A lot of flavor for 86 proof.  A rare find of old bourbon at a decent price, despite the lower proof..it's a pretty darn good value"

F: Very long finish, dominated by tobacco leaves and leather. 

This bourbon is complex, delicious, and should not be overlooked. It has jumped into my top 3."

Nose: (4.25)  Cherry, honey, thick caramel and candy corn.  I could tell right away it was going to be sweeter.

Palate (4.5):  Vanilla, red fruits, sweet corn.  Mouthfeel was thicker.  Oak on the back palate.  Very rich

Finish: (4.25)  Honey and brown sugar fade to butterscotch and oak.  Was medium length finish.

Overall:  I enjoyed it.  Suspiciously close to Barterhouse but with a little more going on."

This dram was really two dimensional.  It had heat and Smoky char...but little else. Where are all the other notes hiding?  Where is the vanilla, the citrus, the cherries and apple?  Where is the burnt sugar and caramel that you expect from quality bourbon aged 15 years?  Again, I find myself looking for the high score of an IW Harper product that the, ""Pro Evaluator"" has found...  ???  I have viewed a few videos where the reviewer agreed with me, and a few where they loved the 15yr.  I guess that is what is great about bourbon.  There is a place for everyone.  While not bad, no way is it worth it $75.  Very nice bottle, even if it is a dribbler.  Thanks @ridethalightin for another Greensboro Buyers Club pick!"

N: Light with oak notes of vanilla and subtle orange peel towards the back

P: Spicier than noted but def. Rich with vanilla and baking spices. Notes of orange towards back like the nose rolling into finish with more vanilla.

F: vanilla and caramel as well as baking spice roll on through into the sunset."

4.25,Nose was vanilla forward with oak and a touch of caramel (when I walked outside and gave this a smell the nose changed to vanilla ice cream) loved this nose.

Finish was sweet but not picking up anything interesting but drinking the rest of my pour outside seem to be better. This bourbon was enjoyed neat as all bourbon should.

3.75,"Nose is predominant with oak - vanilla, raisins, Christmas fruitcake in the background.  

The palate is smooth with a powdered sugar sweetness, barrel char and dried fruits.  The body is disappointingly light and I can only imagine a barrel proof version.  There is still a finish of charred oak and sun dried tobacco.

For the price I wish the proof was higher.  I miss the thicker body of da Noah’s Mill (now NAS but previously 15y age statement).  Loses a half star for value but still a fine bourbon.  I suppose the smooth light finish broaden its appeal but if IW Harper is listening I’d gladly give $125 for a barrel strength rendition."

3.5,"The cork on this is HEAVY.  By far the HEAVIEST cork I've ever pulled.  The top must be crafted from glass or stone. Which leads me to the reason I made this purchase. I bought this for the decanter-style bottle as I much as for the juice. (The bottle itself is at least a $20 value.)

The palate is very balanced with sweet and smooth oak.  This is the longest matured bourbon I've had, and oak is the main engine here.  It works beautifully in melding a single dimensional flavor profile without succumbing to tanins and astringency.  It's quite refreshing.... if somewhat underwhelming.  The finish is initially wood spice, before calming with subsequent tastings.  Then a slight dryness begins to show.  It may be presumptuous of me to say, but this is the Johnnie Walker of bourbons - smooth, uncomplicated, mild, and simple in its refinement.  The bottle design, and the fine liquid, all point to country club politeness and entitlement.  But it's not worth the cost for such a short, and less than memorable, ride.
