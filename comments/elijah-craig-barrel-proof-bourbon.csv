5.0,"HAZMAT, 140.2 proof. Nose is CRAZILY... muted? I was expecting a mack truck but it's pleasant. Caramel, cola, oak and spice. Some musk as well. On the palate, so mellow and smooth. Not true. It's hot, spicy, and numbing, but also sweet and velvety. Some cacao nibs, some nuts, some cola. Fantastic. 8/24/18"

5.0,"Reviewing Batch B517. Whiskey of the Year on Whiskey Advocate's top 20 of 2017.
This one clock's in at 124.2 Proof, which is the lowest proof yet to be released. As with all batches this one is age stated at 12 yrs.
Upon entry you are hit with a big caramel and burnt brown sugar note. Moving to the mid pallette leads to some tobacco, orange peel and oak. Finish is long with tobacco, pepper and more oak. Everything is wonderfully in balance. Adding 4 drops of water tames the oak and pepper notes and brings out some vanilla and Graham cracker notes. It's wonderful neat or with some water. 
This one lives up to the hype. Instant buy and definitely better than the A117. I have an unopened C917 that I hear is also great. The consistency of these batches is truly remarkable."

5.0,"Without a doubt the finest bourbon I’ve ever had the pleasure of tasting. Fell in love with the A118 batch and just picked up a bottle of the B518. Sells in New Hampshire for $49.99 which for a 12 year old, unfiltered, barrel proof whiskey is an absolute steal. You literally can’t do better than that. Cheers to Heaven Hill which is rapidly becoming my distillery of choice."

4.25,"At the price, this is very good. It's what I would reach for when a ""good stiff drink"" is needed. But Bourbons like this I would generally not drink too much of at any one time. Maybe a finger or two...okay, two! I do the same with 3 various Booker's Batches, all very high ABV. The finish will continue to dry your tongue like it's been left out in the Sun at the beach. Drinking it neat, I get two distinct spice burns at different times, one well after the swallow. Definitely agree with @PBMichiganWolverine about the water/ice. That tames this beast and allows for a different experience. Not saying which is the better. Just depends on the mood.

The strength, the burn, the sweet without saccharine, in short, the wonderful bourbon-ness of these liquors allows me to enjoy them without needing too much and also allows me to nurse these suckers 'til the cows come home. 
    
    Thanks to the many posters on this whiskey, especially @PBMichiganWolverine  for stimulating my curiosity about it.

5.0,"I had a pour of their latest release, B518, during a one day quick Chicago business trip.  This is the 12 yr old, taken to cask strength full flavor.  Each batch varies, but they’re all supposedly good to amazing.  I’ve had previously two other EC barrel proof releases, one courtesy of @Dreaming-of-Islay, the other from a bottle I bought.  Both excellent.  But this beats those two.  Hands down this has now taken the top spot for my favorite bourbon, which was previously held by the 2016 Four Roses LESB.  At a mere $60-80, to me this is a no-brainer buy, rather than chasing the Four Roses LESBs, or the BTACs.  This is inches away from being a hazmat warning, clocking at nearly 135ABV.  You get the firepower, but surprisingly none of the heat and burn.  It’s all buttercream and vanilla frosting.  It’s thick and creamy...almost like they put in full fat cream into the vatting.  Only once I made the claim of “you gotta buy this”, and that was for the Brora 30yr old, specifically targeted to the whisky connoisseur ...but this at $69.99 is a must buy for the general masses that love bourbon.  (the price I paid.  As soon as I finished my pour, I bought it immediately online)."

Each aspect of this bourbon is loud. You can smell it from across the room, and each sip shares something new. Heavy, boozy, and delicious it immediately hits the palate like candy before opening up. It is powerfully balanced with exceptionally pleasant complexity even at 136proof. A surprising steal at the price for what is now in my top 5."

4.0,"Tasting the C917 Batch. 
This was the final release of 2017. It clock's in at a healthy 131 proof. As with all batches it's age stated at 12 years. This was the highest proof release of 2017.
I really enjoyed the previous 2 2017 releases and have been excited to give this one a try. I have been sitting on this bottle for a while and finally decided to cork it!
Upon entry you are hit with a big toffee, vanilla and honey notes. As we roll to the mid pallette you are hit with very big spice notes of cinnamon and clove. They are a little overpowering. As they finally recede, the oak presence and vanilla cap the meduim finish. Adding a splash of water made a big difference. The spice recedes and this Bourbon really opens up. The spice is replaced with rich burnt brown sugar and cigar box notes. This is one of the few ECBP releases I would recommend adding water too. Due to this I would give it a 4/5 vs a 5/5. However, with the water added it's outstanding. The whole 2017 vertical is fantastic!"

5.0,"Tasting: B518 from glen cairn glass both neat and then with cap of water.

Appearance:  Amber and slightly oily, plenty of legs and reddish hue.

Nose: (5.0)  Very nose forward bourbon.  Notes of oak, butterscotch, toffee, vanilla with spice.  Ethanol hardly noticed as compared to proof.

Palate: (4.5) toffee, carmel, leather and more oak/ barrel taste, dark fruit and red apple in the background.  Very rich with thicker mouth feel.  A bit oily but pleasing.  Spice comes in at the end with alot of heat.  Adding water brought out more fruit and syrup, kind of like a cherry jolly rancher.  More complex with water added.  Really opens up a new level and cools the burn.

Finish (4.5):  Long lasting with spice, oak barrel and more toffee.

This is a great barrel proof.  You could sit for an hour and discuss the flavors that play well with each other.  The nose however is the star."

Neat, Room temperature, no water added in subsequent tastes, from a Glencairn.  Batch B517.
 
The nose will wake you right up and demand attention.  Complex.  I get vanilla and rye.  A little oak.

The palate is warm and lively.  Cinnamon is notable.  I'm still getting vanilla too.  Subtle sense of sweetness also.

The finish is gorgeous.  Flavors stay with you and mellow into a warm coating that lasts and lasts.  Spicy... Still feeling the cinnamon tingle."

Palate: (5.0)  I got heathbar and a bit of ethanol. Scrumptious chocolate and butterscotch are the main players.  The vanilla plays in the background and then the heat builds and hits you upside the head.

Finish: (5.0) Long finish with spice and cinnamon, beautiful caramel aftertaste.  Coats the palate and builds to a comfortable inner warmth.

4.5,"This is how bourbon should be made. Legs are pretty thick. The nose really draws you in and arouses the curiosity with heavy caramel and and some oak. The nose tells you up-front how great the taste is going to be, and when the taste comes on, it doesn't let you down a single bit.

It has a full body, hits solid at the front of the palate. The flavors are strong, but not overpowering. Amazingly, at 133 proof, it finishes rather kindly; like a bro-hug. It's complex, and the flavors of caramel, oak, honey, and a sort of clove-like rye spice copulate like a foursome on your palate - not ending with a particular spike of anything, but like a climax with a mild grunt from the masculine flavors and ""oohs"" and ""ahhs"" of the feminine flavors. It's literally like that. You could sit in a recliner, wearing a red smoking jacket, sipping a glass of this stuff, as the lingering moans of a couple of exhausted broads echo through your marble-clad chamber... Like you just floored the whole crowd with your violin solo, stole the gaze of all the women, and walked out of the concerto hall as the orchestra humbly fades out with your shadow... Like your boss calls you in to tell you that you got the promotion, but you tell him ""I appreciate that Bob, but I just came by to tell you that I'll be VP of Communications at XXX Co. starting Monday. By the way, I can recommend you a good secretary because Brenda will be joining my team as soon as my plaque is ready."" This is the quintessential bourbon as far as I'm concerned."

Surprisingly no sting on the nose given the proof. Smoothness carries over to the palate (relative to the proof, mind you). The spice and heat are still there, and a sharp acidic note. It's sweet, the floral note from the nose carries over as well. Some leather. Pecan nibs and barrel char at the end. The 2017 batches are very good, this may be my favorite of the three. 11/15/18"

5.0,"After reading such high reviews of this I lucked out and stumbled across a bottle at my local ABC store, which almost never gets any of this. The bottle I purchased was batch C918 and it’ s a little over 131 proof. I payed $60 USD.

Damn. This is a very good bourbon. VERY good.  The nose is sweet - I get vanilla, sweet corn, baking spices, cake frosting, and oak. Maybe a little molasses. The alcohol is definitely there but not overpowering like I was expecting. That being said, it’s 131 proof so don’t go nose diving unless you need to trim back some nose hairs. Being a 12 year bourbon, the oak was not too heavy, but rounded out the nose perfectly.
The taste. Oh, the taste. It mirrors the palate perfectly. I tried it neat first, which seems suicidal at 131 proof but my goodness how can a 131 proof bourbon be so smooth? Perfect for a cold winter night, the warmth overtakes you like a cozy blanket in front of a nice crackling fire. Perfect. I then added a small piece of ice. The gradual melting of the ice peels back layer after layer of flavor. What a dram. I’m going to savor this bottle for a long time. 

If you came a cross a bottle, buy it. I’m not one to pay $60 on a bourbon I haven’t tried, and I honestly can’t justify it in many cases. This was a splurge. And it was one of the best bourbon purchases I have made. At $60, it is a steal. I have never tried the other ECBP batches so have nothing to compare to but it’s better than any bourbon I have enjoyed.

Addendum: Just bought a bottle of A119. It's a blazing 135 proof. The heat on this one is a lot less friendly than C918. The palate is still excellent but not as complex as C918. I'd still rate this one a 4.25/5. Perhaps with a little time the heat will be more tame."

I'd heard the hype for quite some time, so I decided to finally take the plunge and shell out for this one. This will be the first of a short string of bourbon reviews, and I've got to say this one is my favorite by a decent amount (also by far the most expensive).

I often read comments where reviewers suggest that a particular whiskey is almost there, and that a cask strength release would put it over the top. Heaven Hill ensures that one will never say such a thing about Elijah Craig, with this Barrel Proof taking what is a pretty decent entry level bourbon and bringing it to its full potential.

Nose: The makes itself known immediately. Caramel, vanilla, crisp red apple, cinnamon, black pepper, and a heavy oak presence. Also a big leather note, like a baseball glove. Very nice start.

Palate: The oak is presence is even more prominent than it was on the nose. Nice barrel char. Caramel, vanilla, and cola are the most prominent. Nutmeg, brown sugar, and cocoa are also there. It's mostly sweet, but there is some black pepper and cinnamon spice. Done to perfection, and astoundingly drinkable without water at 131 proof.

Finish: Long finish that comes in waves. Not all that hot. I'll call it a warming finish. Definitely cinnamon and black pepper, but there are sweeter chocolate and cola. Amazing from start to finish.

This is my first batch of ECBP, and now I'm going to be hunting down as many as I can possibly find. It's an absolutely phenomenal experience. At $90, it's an expensive buy, but worth every penny. I think that the standard EC is a respectable entry level bourbon. But at Barrel Proof, this stuff really shines. Well done on top shelf pour, Heaven Hill."

4.0,"This is batch C918 from 2018

Proof: 131

Nose: toasted nuts, cranberries and assorted dark fruits, toffee, leather

Palate: very rich and it hits quite sweet at first then the rye kicks in with cinnamon and slight vanilla spices 

Finish: sweet at first again but quickly dry and warm, just enough bite

Tasted this side by side with a 14-year Knob Creek Single Barrel and the Elijah Craig wins in complexity and balance. 

The proof is up there but the alcohol is well hidden by a cornucopia of flavors."

4.5,"Batch C917 - After multiple bottles of this, it can have a range of taste depending on the amount of time/air the bottle has gotten. Can range from burn your entire digestive tract, to a hot oily brown sugar dark fruit with alcohol burn gem, to a full on brown sugar butterscotch smooth slick oily treat. At any stage, this is one of my favorites. Its uniqueness and consistency of quality are what keep this on the shelf at all time, no matter how hot this can get."

tasted side by side with small batch...
the barrel proof is:
nose- less nutty, less tannin, less banana more vanilla and sweeter. turns to a nutty/ chocolate bitterness while you sip.
palette- strong dried cherry and apricot, salt...

first barrel proof in a while... need to remind myself to take smaller sips. lol.

add a couple drops of water...
brings the bitterness out in the nose and nuttiness similar to the small batch. it's quite nice near halfway between the two, possibly 55%.  this brings it near the small batch flavor profile but more intense."

Right now it does smell sweet very strong of corn. On to the pallet let me give it a go... in my state I believe it is a sweet and very tasty has a slight burn. Leaves the pallet with an overall good flavor to linger on. The burn is still there but very subtle a very enjoyable feeling. Would recommend this pour to anyone.

4.5,"Nose: lots of oak, leather, ground coffee, toffee, dark chocolate, with fainter hints of vanilla, pepper, and caramel.

Palate: caramel and butterscotch upfront that gives way to candied fruit, leather, pepper, and baking spice. Drinks below proof (134 in my case) but you can still tell it’s a barrel proof bourbon. It has just the right amount of heat. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. 

Finish: One of the longest I’ve ever had in a bourbon. The flavors linger for minutes. All the sweet flavors fade and give way to leather, oak, and dark chocolate.

Overall: EXCELLENT. This is an excellent value at its MSRP of $60 and the best barrel proof bourbon I’ve had to date. I’d bet that it’s the best barrel proof bourbon you can find relatively easily. Drinking this makes me forget about the loss of the standard 12 year Elijah Craig and the fact that it’s double the price of its NAS small batch brother. This could probably benefit from a few drops of water, but it’s also fantastic neat. The oaky finish pairs well with the sweet flavors on the palate, and the heat is very manageable despite the potent proof."

5.0,"Whisk(e)y: Eljiah Craig Barrl Proof – C917

Nose:

The rye and 65.5% abv gives the nose a peppery sensation along with a flare of the nostril. When you go deeper there’s a memorable smell of leather and cinnamon sticks. Roasted nuts also shows up when you give a nose side to side. You can tell that the nose on this is more complex than the Elijah Craig Small Batch. 

Palate:

After letting this dram sit for 20 minutes neat, here is my take. The first sip coats  your entire mouth. You can definitely feel the layers and complexity on the inner cheek. Very smooth. Heat on the back of the tongue and stays present slightly a minute or so afterwards. Great spice and manageable at 65.5% abv. Keep in mind, this is straight from the barrel and not meant for the kiddies or anyone over the age of 70.

Sip number two I could pick up dark brown sugar / molasses. It has more weight to it than your regular whisk(e)y. I’ve read that chocolate is present in this whisky which I would have to agree to a degree. I find it difficult to pick out, but can sense a subtleness of it if my senses are correct.

Overall: 

This is a great whisky. Plain and simple. I feel that any range of connoisseur would like this, yet, collectors and reviewers will appreciate quite a bit. I love high abv’s personally and find that with such a high percentage on the bottle, it still packs a lot of flavour. Elijah Craig scores major points in this category as the rule of thumb is the higher the abv the less flavour. I sip this only on special occasions or in this instance for reviews. It’s not a whisky to be chugged down, but more so a keeper for the holidays or special occasion. Is this worth buying? Hell ya! Stock your shelves with this one. 
Cheers,"

On the first sip I get a slight alcohol burn but I would expect that. But by the second sip it seems to vanish. The tastes is caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, baking spice, oak, and I think I can taste dark cherries. These flavors are very bold and delicious. This one really coats your mouth with that thick oily feeling. The finish is long and the flavors just linger on and on. This is one heck of a bourbon.

Finish is long, dominated by rye with moderate oak coming at the back. At 67.6% ABV it does need water, and a teaspoon somewhat tames the rye, and allows more subtle notes to sound brighter. Overall, an excellent and complex bourbon that is not overloaded with oak which you may expect from a 12-year-old."

The nose is brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and light leather.
The palate is a little sweet with vanilla and a big barrel/leathery note. And I also get a cola note. It almost seems carbonated for a second, which I’ve never gotten before from a whiskey. Maybe because it reminded me of coke? 
It has a thicker mouthfeel, but that gets lost with the dryness that happens to your tongue and cheeks. It really dries it out, like chalky almost.
All in all I like this one, but it’s the first Barrell Proof Elijah Craig. So I can’t compare to other batches."

4.75,"This is a review of Elijah Craig Barrel Proof batch B519. These notes are taken from several tastings over the past three months. This is one of (if not The) best bourbons I have ever had.

ECBP is a 12 year age stated bourbon from Heaven Hill. This batch is bottled at 61.1% ABV. It pours a gorgeous dark amber and leaves a thick oily coating and long slow legs in the glass. 

The nose has dark molasses, brown sugar, chocolate cherries, caramel, vanilla. A veritable explosion of dark sweetness. Very little alcohol considering the ABV. Water has very little effect on the nose. 

In the mouth there’s more of the same plus dark chocolate and burnt sugar. Mouthwatering. A sweet bomb. Heat on the back end but not overpowering. Water makes it richer, more buttery. Just fantastic. 

The long finish has notes of chocolate covered cherries, oak char, tobacco, leather, and black pepper. Water brings out more baking spices. Either way you get a big Kentucky hug. 

Like I said, this is one of, if not the, best bourbons I’ve had. I really can’t find anything wrong with it. The only one that comes close to this is Bookers. The only Bookers batch I’ve had had an odd note of green oak, so this definitely has the edge. On top of that this bottle was a mere $55 online which makes it an absolute steal. I’m giving this 4.5 plus an extra quarter point for value. 4.75/5. Cheers!"

2.75,"Nose:  Big citrus and cherry on the front end followed by an ethanol bite and a bit of sharp minty/herbal note.  There's some sort of spicy, yet cooling herbs and a real amount of oak.  Thick, dark molasses and caramel on the nose now, with an almost burnt sugar and oak twist at the end.  Brown sugar syrup hides the herbs after it sits for a bit.

Palate:  Hot and mouthcoating.  Wow, that is an explosion of hot, spicy, corn!  There is no hiding that 61.1%abv, which I don't know if I particularly like here.  Immediately after that heat, there's a fleeting (very fleeting) grapefruit and lime note that I'm really surprised by, like this bitter/sour/floral type of thing that is hard to describe.   There so much cinnamon and spice packed in here that the cherry and vanilla are hidden a bit, but still there.  Caramel and corn sweetness round out that hot start.

Finish:  Medium length and mouthwatering.  That initial spice and heat burst doesn't last long.  The next wave is the sweeter fruit and vanilla, but the subtle corn and caramel lasts for some time.  Every once in a while that herbal/oaky note comes back for a visit.

water doesn't really do great things for the nose on this, it pretty much turns into a citrus-scented cleaning solvent.  On the tongue, however, it becomes this thick, velvety syrup that feels like you can actually chew on it!  Much less heat and so much more oak and spice now, that almost too-sweet caramel turns into a really nice almost-burnt toffee that goes really well with all that barrel char.  That little bit of water makes this last and last!  It's kind of like repeatedly liking the inside of a charred barrel that's been coated in caramel.  Wow, this is so much better with water.

Conclusion:  I'm really not blown away with this stuff straight from the bottle, in fact, I don't think I'd ever order a glass even for a great price.  It's just too hot, and not in a good way either.  I've had some great barrel proofs that are nice and warming with enough strong flavors to break through that ethanol.  This, however, is just hot for the sake of being hot.  After adding a pretty generous amount of water this becomes something I'd order everyday!  Though the nose is not something to call home about, the smokey toffee that shines through is the perfect thing for a cold night!"

A little water let's the sweetness shine through."

Another dash brought out some milk chocolate covered cherries. Then some more and it was tasting like the usual small batch EC. Fun stuff. Fun when wet."
3.5,"Hmm I'm not having a good run with bourbons lately. Not because they are bad but they are just not a profile I like. Very sickly sweet cherry, liquorice etc. I can see how people would rate this highly as it's a quality dram but you could say that about a good kombucha or such like... great quality wholesome drink but urgh zero balance just over powering sweet simplicity. 2 for flavour 4.5 for quality call it 3.5 even"

4.25,"This particular bottle is from batch B518 and comes in at 133.4 proof. Being uncut and unfiltered it is quite dark in the glass.

Nose: The nose is dominated by campfire and brown sugar. Think the smell of charred logs. The alcohol is also very present but a couple drops of water do a good job of taming it.

Palate: Very rich. Buttery biscuits at first then molasses comes next. The high alcohol content makes the flavors incredibly intense, almost eye watering.

Finish: Starts with barrel char and smoke that eventual fades to black tea. Goes on for a bit aided by the proof. The addition of water does shorten the finish slightly.

At under $100 this is a very good value. The addition of water helped the nose but I don’t think it helped the palate or the finish so my preferred method has been to start neat and then add a couple of drops around halfway through so I get the best of both worlds. Will certainly be enjoying every drop of this while it lasts.

Cheers!"
4.25,Heaven hills best offering to date but not for the beginner and not for the faint of heart. I recommend trying neat then adding a few drops of water to really pull the flavors out of here. BIG and BOLD should be this bourbons nickname as it will take you back a step when nosing or tasting. Verdict: Very very good stuff but beware the high proof and explosive nose and palate.
3.75,"Batch A119, 67.6% abv

The abv is so high that you can feel the whiskey evaporating off your tongue when you sip it, very strange sensation. The flavors are dark, rich, and intense. Turns out that’s not entirely a good thing by itself. Really needs something bright in there to provide balance and keep it interesting. But if you want to be overwhelmed by caramel, vanilla, leather, etc. then it’s worth a shot."
