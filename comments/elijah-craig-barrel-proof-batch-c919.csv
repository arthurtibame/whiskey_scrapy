Palate: dry, spicy and hot, pepper, leather

Finished: Honey, lingers"
4.0,"Powerful. Clove, cinnamon, Cherry/Vanilla Coke, and the smell of an empty pipe a few days after smoking. It’s sweetens over time. 

Faux-leather, root beer, baking spices, tobacco. All these things are frickin heavy weights. 

I like old. I like barrel proof. Therefore, I like this. TY ECBP."

4.25,Beautiful bourbon. For such such a high proof bourbon it is surprisingly smooth.
4.25,"750ml neat in Glencairn at home.  Near hazmat level, so expecting some heat on this one.

Nose is nutty, with lots of vanilla and caramel, some mild oak.  Sweet, with some ethanol coming on late.  Taste is more vanilla, ripe red apples, then the heat comes smashing in, bringing oak and spice to the party.  Lingering hot spicy end.  This batch has more heat than others I have had - it is higher proof, so that is on the one hand to be expected, but on the other hand the proof typically didn't make much difference in other batches, with the smooth vanilla and caramel winning out.  This batch packs a real punch.

Add 3 drops of water.  Nose is a bit more complex, with spice notes subbing in for the ethanol.  Taste is similar, with more spice and vanilla shining through over the heat.  

11/6/19.

Verdict: definitely add some water, this batch is no joke, but really nice."

4.5,"Color is a rich mahogany, just beautiful. 

Nose has virtually no burn. Sweet oak, leather, dark chocolate, cinnamon, and baking spice. A fun nose to pick apart as it is deep and inviting.

Palate doesn't drink like a 137 proof pour. The heat is there but it slightly hidden beneath caramel, cinnamon, tobacco, Risen Chocolate candies, and oak. 

Finish is long and strong with a fun lip tingle. Baking spice, vanilla, candied cherries are all mingling and begging you take another sip.

This may be my favorite of 2019, but will have to do a blind."

3.75,Best batch since the 2017 batches.
4.25,"In a side-by-side comparison, the C919 simply outshines the B519 thanks to the beautiful richness and viscosity that has made ECBP such a popular and sought after whiskey. The C batch takes everything in the B batch to another level, and has the classic sweet Bourbon flavors to match the powerful oak and proof inherent in this batch. I bunkered a 2nd bottle of this beauty....don’t pass on this one if your on the fence.....a terrific bottle of Bourbon."

Palate: balanced and a little spicy
Finish: nice long warm finish that lingers"
4.5,"Love this one compared to all I’ve tried prior last year.  Can’t think of a better bourbon, age, proof, price and mostly available in my area.  Would put up against the BTACs any day.  Instead of paying crazy aftermarket prices or hunting those buy this whenever you see it.  Especially if you like barrel proofs."
4.0,"N: Salted butter and brown sugar beaten together. Hints of melon. Didn’t get the melon until I compared the nose to Blanton’s STFB. 

P: Huge spice leading into a cinnamon berry blend. 

F: Days. Super rich. 

Still getting used to cask strength bourbons, working on picking out notes. Very good first impression though"

4.25,"Neck Pour, just opened, sat out for 10 min.

Very condensed black cherry vanilla and oak on the nose

Very warming and mouth quenching on the taste due to high proof. Bourbons, in my opinion, have a congruence from nose to taste with few curve-balls.  That being said there is something very savory that translates all the way through; from nose to finish. Spice arrives on the finish, allowing this to linger for awhile. I imagine water might be a good addition in the summer time. The low cost and cask strength make this a must buy."

4.5,"Great nose - vanilla.  Definite pepper on the tongue - thanks to high ABV, fruity finish. 136.5 highest proof I’ve ever had.  Paid $65 for last bottle in the store."
4.25,A spicy nose with nose with orange blossom.  A bite and rising burn up from with lasting and complex finish. Honey undertones with floral notes dancing throughout. Very big and very satisfying.

Some of Heaven Hill's finest to date IMO."
4.75,Insanely good...C919 is among the best ever batches of ECBP in my opinion
4.25,"Personally I find ECBP to be one of the best releases on the market. Each batch can actually be found on shelves and do not seem to disappoint. C919 has a typical brown sugar nose, but be careful not to inhale to deeply as the near 70% alcohol content is defintely present. On the tongue this one defintely brings the heat along with some burnt caramel and vanilla toffee notes. Most will probably want a little water or a chip of ice to mellow this fireball out, but it is full flavored in any case. EC may have pushed the proof on this one a touch too far though as it isn't as good as the B batch released earlier in 2019."

4.5,"BACKGROUND: First brought to market by Heaven Hill Distillery in 2013, Elijah Craig Barrel Proof is an uncut, unfiltered powerhouse that is released once each quarter.

The bourbon is aged for an impressive 12 years before being bottled at full cask strength, and it joins several other popular high-octane bourbons that include George T. Stagg, Booker’s, and E.H. Taylor Barrel Proof, just to name a few.

Each Elijah Craig Barrel Proof release carries a distinct four-character code that begins with a letter denoting the batch - A is the initial batch release each year, B is the second, and C is the third.  A number for the month it was released - traditionally, 1 for January, 5 for May, and 9 for September -  follows, and the final two digits represent the year. 

 Thus, C919 was the third batch of the year, and it was released in September of 2019.

Elijah Craig bourbon is named for a Baptist minister who opened a distillery in Kentucky in 1789, and legend claims that Craig accidentally invented the process of aging whiskey in charred barrels after his barn caught fire. 

Despite the fact that the fire, according to lore, burned the barrels that were stored inside the barn, Craig decided to use them to ship his whiskey anyway.  Customers who received the barrels were supposedly delighted with the effect that barrel char had upon its contents, and a new method of aging was born…or not.

Like much of modern day bourbon marketing, the legend of Craig’s amazing discovery is simply the kind of hokum that snake oil salesmen once peddled.

The truth of the matter is that the French began storing cognac in charred barrels in the 15th Century, and the practice was likely begun because coopers (the fancy term for “barrel makers) found that charring helped retain the liquor inside without leaking.  It is also believed that charring simply burned away any splinters, wood chips, or pesky bugs that were inside the freshly-made barrel. 

One might also assume that a bourbon named for an 18th Century distiller would have a storied history dating back to the earliest days of the spirit, but the first bottling of Elijah Craig was produced in 1986 and has no ties to its namesake. 

The C919 bottle I sampled retails for $60 - an incredible bargain considering its age and proof - and it was produced from a mashbill consisting of 75% corn, 13% rye, and 12% malted barley.

NOSE: The nose is a marriage of caramel, oak, leather, and the delightfully musty smell of age that you get when entering an antique book store or a rick house that has been left undisturbed for a long period.  Some bourbons that are proofed this high smell a bit like jet fuel, but there was surprisingly little ethanol in the ECBP nose.

PALATE: The palate offers the most basic combination of caramel and oak, but when flavors combine absolutely perfectly in a bourbon like this one, basic is more than sufficient.  An oily and viscous mouthfeel add to the enjoyment of the flavors.  

FINISH: The long finish is where the depth and complexity of this bourbon kicks in.  A cherry bomb explosion on the finish is followed by oak, leather, cinnamon, and lots of pepper.  A delayed heat builds, explodes, and subsides.  If you have ever viewed an episode of the YouTube show “Hot Ones” and watched a celebrity’s reaction to Da Bomb hot sauce, I would imagine the experiences might be a bit similar.

FINAL ASSESSMENT:  Some high-proof bourbons burn for the sake of burning and do not offer complexity or character.  Elijah Craig Barrel proof, however, balances taste and proof in a way that produces a warming and comforting blanket of flavor.  Rather than simply tasting this bourbon, you end up experiencing this bourbon."

4.75,"Better review forthcoming. Tasted neat, 30min rest
Nose: cinnamon toffee
Palate: spicy. Vanilla, apples, dry holiday spices. Unbelievable taste at this proof drinking it neat. 
Finish: feel is smooth, taste is apple and cinnamon. Subtle burn. That proof!

If you see it, buy it. Found mine for $62 in late Jan 2020."
4.5,"Very sweet nose. Lots of vanilla, sweet cinnamon, brown sugar, molasses. There's definitely some savoriness too with leather, tobacco, shoe polish, and some barrel char going on.

Palate shows slow heat, but it's there, and not overwhelming. Brown sugar and molasses, vanilla, snickerdoodle cookies, leather, spearmint, and it kinda finishes a bit like the way an old bookstore smells. Very smooth and mouth coating. Freakin great stuff.

Wow, what a potent bourbon with an astronomically high ABV that is much more approachable for me than maybe expected with just a few drops of water. Proof of what proper storage does over 12 years in Kentucky. Beautiful stuff."
4.5,"Outstanding! Everything you want from a barrel proof and still surprisingly easy to drink. Rich, warm, sweet complexity that lingers for days. Job well done Heaven Hill! Was really looking forward to trying this one and it did not disappoint."

4.5,"Neat.  Neck pour.  Right off the bat this hit me as something special.  Brighter than I was expecting. This super nice French vanilla leads the nose, hint of mint behind it.  Berries and cream.  Sea salt caramel.  Graham crackers and chocolate.  Little honey too.  Clearly just a wave through all these amazing desert flavors. The oak is less prevalent than other ECBP batches.  The alcohol has less presence too considering the near hazmat proof.

Syrupy and viscous as hell in the texture, I love that.  Intense sweetness on the tongue.  Brown sugar.  The taste and finish are the verse of the nose.  Starts out dark with chocolate and burnt caramel, transitions to the graham cracker and then into the vanilla and mint.  There is also a very prevalent black pepper.  Very drying and the oak is really showing up on the tail end of the finish.

Great ECBP batch.  Not overly oaky, dialed up to the max wave of dessert flavors.  The high proof doesn’t come with an aggressive or spiky notes. 

Comparing to B519, B519 has some spiky alcohol notes on the nose.  They are very similar.  B519 has more spice and cherry.  C919 has more caramel and vanilla on the nose.  On the taste, B519 has some intense oak that is not on the C919.  The turned down oak let’s the C919 shine a bit more.  Both are great but the C919 is better."
4.5,"Amber color. Fantastic nose with pipe tobacco, caramel, cinnamon, spearmint and leather. Creamy mouthfeel. Palate has lots of oak, charred cinnamon stick, oatmeal raisin cookies, and a hint of black pepper. Finish is long, hot and dry, with more oak, tobacco, cinnamon and allspice. This may not be the best ECBP ever, but it's damn good!"

3.75,"nose - dark roasted malts, heavy vanilla, cherry, oak, chocolate, this thing is deep and intense

Taste - so the thing is no matter how much you water this down, there's alcohol. It's a big of a problem. Now you get there rich vanilla oaks and cherries, and just oak.  It's all good stuff. There's a level of acidic and muted and funk here and that isn't optimal but you'd have to water this down to get it. 

The bottom line is this is an amazing ECBP, but it isn't perfect.  I'm giving it a 3.75 which is an amazing score for a bourbon, but there are real issues."

3.5,"First time trying with a hint of water

Nose - vanilla and spices. Pepper on the nose as well makes me think this will be quite spicy. Complex and heat to my nose 

Taste - can feel the heat as soon as it hits the tongue. Pretty complex but heat is the main word I would describe this one. Pepper, floral notes, vanilla and spicy notes throughout the palate and surprisingly finishes sweet and smooth.

Overall and value - one of my first barrel proofs. I expected some heat but this one was almost too much for me. Very complex with all the flavors but I could do without all the up front heat on this one. I do like how this bottle is getting easier to find. 60$ range in my area and found a few places."

5.0,"Color: deep golden brown, almost opaque

Legs: These things form at the very brim of the line and unexpectedly slow, but once they group (relatively far apart), they take off like the dickens

Nose: for being such a high proof, it's ultra sweet, lots of oak, butterscotch and some chocolate.  it's hard to keep the nose in too long as the proof burns with anything deep or long

First Sip: it's like drinking carmel syrup, if you let it rolls around the front, it doesn't burn much.  as it rolls to the back, a little bit of the oak and floral notes come through

Taste: It's incredibly sweet and oaky for a really high proof.  It's so smooth though that it's incredibly dangerous.  Yes you can tell the proof but it's not overpowering.

Finish: slight burn on the first taste or two going down but the residual flavors urge and crave you to do it again.  some vanilla still on the tongue with a hint of butterscotch.  

For the price/value and the proof and the taste, I'm not sure it gets much better than this."
5.0,"Not available around my area unlike B519 which I do not really fancy. To me up to this point B518 still tops all the batches.
