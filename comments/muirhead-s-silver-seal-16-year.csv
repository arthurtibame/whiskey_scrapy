3.25,"Nose: sweet with floral notes. Hints of chocolate and fruit.

Taste: surprising burn that comes on immediately. Sweet and full with hits on chocolate and fruit. Slightly oily, but does not coat the mouth. Overall, great, but a bit expensive for the quality. Good mantel bottle for sharing “the good stuff”"

3.0,"Nose-Classic sherry characteristics. Honey and raisins come through clearly.
Body- Raisins continue with a syrupy sweetness and a bit of bright astringency. 
Finish- A light finish that gives way to floral grass, mint, and lavender.

Note- This is actually the 12 year expression. For the price, it is very good. The overall profile puts it in the category shared with Balvenie Doublewood. However, I will pay the extra twenty and have the toasted oats and warm almond flavors that balance with the honey sweetness of Balvenie. This is a less refined syrupy sweet."
