IrishAmerican Whiskey are a small operation that currently only have this 10yo single malt and a NAS blend - both sourced (probably Midleton as their website says it was distilled in South West Ireland).  They have been selling their whiskey for around four years in Ireland and the east coast of the US, mainly in Boston and New York.

The nose and taste were nothing special (typical vanilla and spice is all I can recall) and the finish was on the short side.

What drew me to their stand to talk to the son of the owner was that I had heard that they were establishing a distillery on Achill Island on the west coast of Ireland. My old man hails from there and indeed their distillery will be located in the site of the closed Achill Brewery - a recent short-lived enterprise run by some of my distant cousins.  

They recently had stills shipped over from Speyside and my hope is that as an island distillery facing the vast expanse of Atlantic they will produce, in time, a whiskey with a distinct Irish island character."
