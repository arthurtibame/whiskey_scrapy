3.75,"the nose has a strong whiff of barnyard funk, mesquite BBQ, sawdust, buttered popcorn, spearmint, vanilla frosting and oak, the palate leads with full, oak that's both green and sweet, rye spice and a touch of honey. The finish is warming spice, grassy and a hint of honey. This is a roller coaster of flavors."
4.0,Skittles on the nose. Red vines. Oak. A little leather. Not as much forward rye flavor as some. Good.
4.0,Very smooth. Good aromatics.   Goes down like water
