5.0,"I had a bottle of Fall '14. Loads of leather on the nose, like walking into  a boot shop. That's followed by vanilla, sweet corn, corn muffins, nutmeg, and cherry cola. The palate is smooth, creamy, inviting. It leads with smoky leather, followed by sweet corn and vanilla. The finish is a bit tannic, with slightly bitter oak, leading into cherry cola, followed by bitter chocolate and espresso. I am also left with an impression of sweet cream butter, which is present throughout the palate, and some indefinable sour citrus on the mid palate. Quite easily my favorite whiskey."

1.0,"If you took bourbon and soaked bacon, old leather shoes and what's left over from a smoked cigar in it you get this.  I wouldn't call this bourbon by what most would expect from a bourbon.  Heavy on corn.  Seems like it wasn't ages long enough yet its overpowered by these flavor which aren't balanced out.  Also think it's way overpriced.  I have a large bourbon party every year and no one will drink this stuff."

2.0,"It gets a 10/10 for uniqueness but only about a 2/10 in quality. This is very special bourbon, and for me not in a good way. The nose and taste are like nothing I've ever had. Very musty, sort of like a wet, damp sock. Very high corn taste which wasn't bad to me, but it was lost in and overwhelmed by the dank taste and feel. Complete lack of traditional caramel notes you find in almost every bourbon. Unfortunately I'm not sure what bottling I had. Glad I tried it, but would never ever consider paying $70+ for a bottle. Wouldn't mind trying one with more age, although maybe the Texas heat is what ruined this bourbon.  If you're looking to buy this, my opinion would be to listen to those who say something similar and not those who praise it as a top bourbon."
4.0,"Fall '14. Very nice bourbon, a great expression but WTF what a price.
    Colour is great, very clear caramel, and with a little water it won't get cloudy. I tasted it at about 70 proof. At the nose, definitively leather, but with some oily smells like roasted sesame and a little spicy pepper flavour.
    Body is smoky, creamy with embers, aftertaste is metallic with a slightly bitter note.
    Base notes are, for me, earthy with a little bit of dried fruit.
    4 stars, great spirit."

The taste was stronger on the spice than I anticipated with the high corn sweet, but well balanced. I prefer this with just a bit of water."

Wheat, wet sand, chewing gum, thick syrup, sugar, belgian waffles, brown sugars, cinnamon dough, a cookie-ness to it.  Funnel cakes candle wax, marshmallow and hay are on the back of the nose.  Pallet: crazy smooth, TONS of corn, spice on far back pallet, then covers pallet.  Sweat tea, alcohol but very rounded and bouncy.  Very unique.  More wax on the back pallet but not unpleasant.  Finish is paper, sweet syrupy with granulated sugar, some pleasant spices, whispers of a buttery smokiness and....corn corn corn....."

3.75,"3.75  Garrison Brothers:
              Price 40 dollars for 375 Ml.
              Bottle: Cool.
              Nose: As First Poured- Alchohol was the first thing I noticed...
              First sip: a little Burn, and little bitey on first sip, carmel toward the back, and .. lingering notes of wood... Maybe a little smokey..
              
              After letting it sit in the glass in front of me, the smell of carmel popcorn wafted from a good 20 inches from the glass, making my mouth water... 
              
              Second nose: If i get too close to the glass, the alchohol overpowers the sweeter notes... so I backed off about six inches... now I get the sweet mouth watering essence of sweet buttery corn...
              
              Second sip: Definately taste the oak barrel in this, but it is nice... the corn comes after... and there is a little burn on the swallow with a finish that reminds me of ambesol. haha... 
              
              Then it loosens up to a nice liqourice... oak notes remain, then that sweet aroma of spring time fresh hay mixed with roasted marshmallows... and my mouth begins to water for another sip...
              
              This is a young bourbon whiskey, but the Texas Heat and Texas Corn must do something to bring out that wood barrel note... it seems to get more aromatic the longer it sits in front of me. The longer I wait between sips,, the more I want to taste it again.
              
              Worth the price in my opinion for a neat sipper... It is good... damn good.
              
              But I cant imagine mixing it in anything...
              
              As I take another sip, this makes me feel as close to being back on the farm, hauling hay... riding my horse... that smell of fall leaves... hay... the smell of leather... the grain feed I used to feed to the horses... it is all there...
              
              I grew up, moved away... lived the city life since, but I miss it. This drink takes me right back there...
              Ahhh...
              
              . . .
          
          I think I will sit here for an hour and just sip on Garrison Brothers... Taking my time with this to really give some quality time to experience everything it is... 
           Salude!"

4.0,"$84.99 @ TW. Reviewing the 2016 spring release.
This is a polarizing Bourbon. However, I always find it to be a solid pour and this is no exception. Upon entry you are immediately hit with a strong corn bread and cereal note. Some baking spices kick in on the mid palatte with a long dry finish showcasing oak and more of the cereal note. Very tasty and easy to drink. For comparison sake I drank a pour of Weller 12 after it and can say while Weller was superior it wasn't vastly so. 
The big question is does this Bourbon justify the high price. I would say if Weller 12 or Rebel Yell Single were readily available then hands down no. However, given how difficult those 2 are to come by, this makes this Bourbon very appealing even at the high price."
3.0,"Very heavy on alcohol at first. 

After letting it air for a bit, there's a nice sweet corn / caramel to the nose. But the hit of alcohol is still there. 

First sip: Very corn forward, little oily, with some nice spice on the back. It lingers for a nice minute or two. 

Second sip: Still very corn forward, it just tastes like a young bourbon. 

It's a pretty nice flavor profile, but I can't justify the $70 per 750ml. If it were down in the $50 range I think it would be an easy recommendation."

The leather, oak, dryness, and turpentine are too much for me. They should wander up the road to Balcones and take some lessons. Don't wait your money on this one and just get the Balmorhea - that's the only Garrison that should go in your mouth"

1.0,"Awful. This is so bad. Whatever error garrison made with this batch should be learned from and advertised to the industry so no one makes it again. The nose is pure oak, the first sip is like chewing on an oak limb. If there are other flavors you can’t taste it through all the oak. It started to make me nauseous as i drank it. Mixed it in coke, couldn’t hide it. Just bad.   I gave it one star because it whiskey."

0.25,"2018 edition 47%. 

Nose - Clay, dirt, crayons, and I get some sweetness in the back.  But yeah imagine a box or crayons where some mud and dirt and clay were somehow added and then left there for about a year.  Open that up and mix in at the very end a hint if alcohol and a hint of I dunno maybe caramel.  

Taste - The opening is clay then it shifts sweet giving off some traditional bourbon notes.  Now we go back into waxy crayons, clay puddy, and then back to sweet with some bourbon notes.  Maybe some flowers?  not in a good way just kinda earthy and floral flower notes.  

I mostly suffered through this stuff again to provide a PSA.  Garrison Brother's has gotten a lot of love and a lot of hate.  I can't tell if batch variation is a thing or if some people like this stuff.  I've emailed the distillery and they've assured me clay puddy isn't a note I should taste or smell, but I've talked to numerous people who have gotten the same notes which makes me think if this is off, it's a COMMON off note.  

I would like to try a different batch to see if this if this is just me, but either way unless you enjoy drinking dirt, this pretty much sucks.  The nose is far worse than the taste where there's actually some bourbon quality notes.  Still it tastes awful.  

Overall you can't mix this to make it better.  You can only drain pour it or share it with others to stop them buying one."

2.5,Eighty dollars??? For this? Really?  I'm super glad I tried this at a bar before wasting a bunch of money on it.  You know how 'Poor Man's Pappy' is a thing? 'Poor Man's Garrison Bro' should be a thing.  Take two handles of Weller Special Reserve. Put it in one of those tiny 1 gallon shitty oak barrels.  Wait 3 weeks.  Now it's over oaked and has some burnt and cleaning supply-like crappy flavors.  Perfect! Now you have a gallon of Garrison Bros equivalent.  Honestly all those supplies would still probably be cheaper than actually buying a fifth of this crap.
3.75,"(2018 Edition) Smells complex yet refined for a Texas bourbon expected of the Garrison Brothers price tag. One ice cube. Initial heat on the first sip mellows with time. Becomes surprising smooth with a medium, subtle finish. Very well done but missing depth to round it out."
