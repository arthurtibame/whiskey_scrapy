4.0,"Really great value for money!  This is a sherry bomb in the truest sense.  It's rich, thick, and bitter sweet.   Nose greets you with honey and dried fruits, followed by more of the same on the palette, and a long lingering minty finish.  Considering it's about $80, great value for a 21 year old.  Try getting a 21 yr old other sherry finish (yes, you Macallan) for that price and just as good.  Not to get into economic here...but, if a 21 year old sherry cask from Glenfarclas is about $80, and assuming a 8% return on  their investment, it then makes you wonder the profit margin on a similar Macallan!    By the way...with Brexit, wondering if these Scottish treats will become a bit cheaper?  Pound should nosedive with a stronger dollar.  Maybe not...retailers here will simply take the difference for themselves."

5.0,"What a beauty... Nose pulls you in with fresh baked pineapple upside-down cake and a bready note like rich Challah. Little snatches of Nutella... Tell-tale Glenfarclas on the palate; fruity, bold spices and cedar, with a certain bittersweet maturity. Powerful musty oak finish, dark and looming, coats the back of your throat and stays there! Generously sampled from the current drinking collection of the splendiferous Pranay, a no-brainer purchase, I will be seeking a fifth! Dry glass: Nutty marzipan."

3.0,Not my favorite glenfarclas I much prefer the 15 & 17 over the 21 & 25. Still a good whisky though a very light tasting scotch not overpowering on the sherry influence sweet fruity  a touch of zest smooth on the palate with a touch of spice the finish was too short for my liking maybe I'm do used to drinking peaty whisky which I feel overs a longer finish slainte

4.0,"When you are looking for an older, substantial Single Malt that isn't outrageously expensive, consider Glenfarclas 21. Intense fruitiness, green apples, gooseberries and hints of pineapple dominate the nose. Fresh herbs, heather honey and faint smoke of 'burned stuff' linger in the background, adding a pleasant complexity. The age of this malt shows in the taste: heavy cask influence with wood spices and tannins combines with fruits and vanilla, culminating in a lasting, nutty and slightly dry finish. A characterful and intriguing Speysider for sophisticated palates.

5.0,"Glenfarclas is the epitome of a distillery with a house style...you know a Glenfarclas when you try it. How does this one measure up? Sherry aging - check. Spicy and rich without being cloying - check. Christmas pudding with dried fruit and nuts - check. Gentlest note of pipe tobacco - check. The 21 year old comes with a bit of apple (which pairs so nicely with the raisin and spice from the sherry and oak), and a slightly minty finish that lasts for a good little while. A very fine offering from Glenfarclas!"

4.0,"Glenfarclas is your typical Speysider. Every one of its expressions will give you a fruity, gentle light dram.  The best part of this distillery is that most bottles are not expensive, and it is a balanced nice dram. Personally i prefer stronger, bolder whiskies, but i can deny there is a strong market for this type of whiskies.

Bottled at 43%abv, golden color.

The Nose is the best part of it, mantaining the typical speysider traits, but definitively no sherry as described in the bottle. The first note that hits you is a strong yellow apple aroma, which is the most recognizable one. Vanilla, fondant and lemon pie after the first sip. Thick caramel is great here. Very fresh, no alcohol note at all. Cinnamon also present. 

On the palate is way too light. Specially for a 43%abv. Apples and honey, but very watery. There is an oak spice and nutty notes, but overall it feels too watery. 

Aftertaste is good, with burnt hay and mild pleasant tobacco note, from some small peatiness. Vanilla is present and ginger spice. Pleasant and long, well crafted aftertaste. 

Overall this is a good dram for around 110$, you can't normally find a 21yo at that price, and i don't know if that is good or bad when describing this whisky. My score for it is a fair 86 over 100; and my final take on it is that it is way too similar to their other expressions, particularly to the 25yo. Oh! Almost forgot! No sherry at all, i did not find any on this one."

4.5,"Served neat in a Glencairn class, freshly opened new bottle.

So sweet and pretty on the nose!  Sherry is the star, with apple streusel making an appearance, and some surprisingly floral notes, as well.

Sherry is again the dominating note, with dried apricots and green apple bobs taking the mid-pallate. Honey and unlit cigars round out the tasting.  Mouth-feel isn't thin, but isn't as luscious as the best.  The oak is subdued, but definitely there.

The finish is much spicier than I would expect for the age, and the oak isn't nearly as prominent as I expected, again, especially for the age.  I would guess the cask was not a first fill, or possibly not European oak.

This Sherry bomb could be tops if it were more complex, but for the money, this is one of the best values out there."

4.0,"One of the more affordable 21-year scotches available, at least in my area. Retails for $149 CAD, I was able to get it for $103.
As a fan of the 12 year, I was a little surprised this wasn't light years ahead. I have never been a big ""water guy"", but this is one of the drams I do add a few generous drops of water too. Prior to the water I feel it almost tastes like the 12, tasty but unrefined (after 21 years?!). The water turns it into an elegant and delicate dram, sweet roasted barley with a delicate but decent finish.
I rate this high due to the value, but if you can get your hands on the aberfeldy 21 which is similarly priced here I would recommend that above this."

4.5,"Nose: super rich, not punchy, banana, tropical, sultana, smooth, sun cream, banana and peanut butter on toast
Body: smooth, refined, retains the firmness but very delicate, juicy, open and bright, slightly dry
Palate: banana and peanut butter, toast, biscuit, tropical, bright and fresh, very well balanced
Finish: long, a light mouth cost"
4.25,"Nose: much lighter sherry nose than the 15, but still there. Red apples, orange again, caramel at the back. Brown sugar, cookie dough. Banana (stolen from jack) 

Palate: much more light than the 15, subtler sherry notes with more shortbread, herbal, thin in a nice way. Archie at luvians said refreshing and I totally agree. Incredibly well balanced fruitiness, nuttiness and wood. 

Finish: long, becomes fruitier and greener with the grassy glenfarclas spirit coming back through again. 

This might beat out the 15 for how delicate and balanced it is. So light without sacrificing fruitiness and sherry depth. May be a new favourite."

3.5,"Two fingers neat in a stemmed nosing glass.
Pours a nice golden amber.
Smells like fermenting bread with a sourdough character, plus a distinct hint of the sweetness to come. Decent bit of oak, with earthiness and resinous character from the wood. Bit of peppery spice, with some solvent notes.
Sweet and spicy! Honey and sugar with a hot hot zip of alcohol, leading to a long, warm, numbing finish. I swear I've had gentler whiskey at cask strength. Acidic and oily, coating the mouth with a heated blanket.
Long hot finish moving from the mouth to the throat and beyond; some deep cooling breaths help balance the heat, and bring some dark cocoa along with the ghost of sweetness. Szechuan peppercorn numbness lingers long after the last sips.
Overall, not a favourite of mine... Lots of character to the point of being brash and abrasive, with the sweetness trying to soften an otherwise weighty blow. I wouldn't get another bottle at Onterrible prices..."
