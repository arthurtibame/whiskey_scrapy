3.5,Very oaky! High corn.  Sweet finish.  Full flavor.  Barrel 52

3.75,"Very different... medium amber color, slow legs.  Nose of butterscotch (initially thought butter, milk chocolate and oddly salt) with ethanol.  Palate of cooked pears, leather and hints of caramel on the finish that lingers into ripe banana and butterscotch again.  Virtually no spice but has a mild ethanol burn on the back of the tongue and throat.  I suspect an ester from their unique yeast combines with the oak char to yield the unique butterscotch.  For the uniqueness will likely keep it on hand and turn to it again when campfire weather comes."
