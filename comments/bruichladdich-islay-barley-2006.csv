4.0,"[Review of the 2007 edition of the Islay Barley] An interesting experiment in terroir, the idea that the characteristics of a place can generate certain flavours. Even at a young age, this stuff is pretty good: light peat, seaweed, salty sea breeze, salted caramel, apple skins. Menthol, herbal, floral notes. Buttered popcorn. Complex (especially for such a young age), bittersweet. A bit hot and peppery on the palate, but quite solid, fresh, interesting."

4.0,I've gone through about 9 bottles of the Laddie10 and heard that it may be discontinued. So I bought this version and can say that it is a younger more intense version with the higher alcohol kick. You could call it an Angry Laddie10.

4.0,"Nose: Tropical fruits, sweet barley with floral touch, like golden fields of barley. Honey and vanilla.

Taste: Pepper and malted barley and sugars. Honey and citrus fruits.

Finish: Peppery and crispy fruity. Not too crispy.

Balance: Fresh in every way."
