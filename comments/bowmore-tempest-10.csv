4.0,"I've had 4 of the 5 different batches. They're all pretty good, though I recall batch #2 (I think) as being particularly excellent and worthy of 5 stars."

4.0,Smokey aroma.  Sweet aftertaste from the bourbon barrels.  Recommend that this whiskey be opened up.

4.0,"This is a serious dram...nose is busy, sweet fruit almost tropical but also brine, peat  and floral notes. Busy, complex and full smelling. Taste has an initial sweetness and fruit that almost instantly gets smashed by salt, iodine and spice. This is not the place to introduce someone to whisky! Firm peat make itself known on the finish and the taste lingers for ages after you swallow. Salty liquorice and peat is the lasting impression. It overloads your palate and I can see this turning as many people off as on.  I actually like it neat but water adds a note of smoothness to the presentation and opens out the peat. This is a huge whisky almost comic book in its approach. I like it but not a preferred dram after a long day.  4 stars just for the wild ride or 92."

2.0,Vault Edition was better - 3
2.5,"I received a sample and was not expecting much as I don’t really like the regular Bowmore 10. 

Hits the palette hot and doesn’t feel like cask strength is the right point.  Lots of alcohol and sparky on the tongue. 

This one really needs water. The same night I had Lot 40 Cask Strength at 57% and it was excellent as bottled. This Bowmore needs water. 

With water you get some fruit and the lightest hint of peat. Much better with water. 

Nice to try but I wouldn’t buy."
