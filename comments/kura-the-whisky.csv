Taste: Smooth, light barley n grains, light peat, a bit of slight wood flavor

Enjoying much more than before. Good stuff although pretty mellow and light overall."

2.5,Smelled of plumb. Definitely more of a scotch taste. Was smoother than i thought. Was boozy without being harsh

4.5,"Slightly sweet on the front, beautiful, soft, and mellow as it rolls off the tongue."
1.75,"ugh, this was just not good.  not balanced at all.  hot up front even though it's only 40% abv.  it has a weird finish, like an burnt aftertaste.  I tried it in a highball thinking that it would be better but that aftertaste is still there.  not sure what to do with this bottle."

2.25,"Very light aroma. Hard to discern anything really. Over ripened apples, light butterscotch. Nothing interesting at all."
3.75,"Decent for the price. Has notes of peat, smoke, vanilla, dried fruit, treacle, citrus, peach, chocolate, and passionfruit with a creamy mouthfeel but doesn't have much of a finish."
