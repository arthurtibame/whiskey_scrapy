Deep, a hint of sweetness. Creamy."

5.0,"Great stuff with notes of raisins, raspberries, chocolate, toffee, some plums, a little peat, pepper, and a little sea salt bright and bold with a nice creamy smooth slightly nutty mouthfeel. Sweeter than the Yoichi 15/20."
4.25,"The third bottle I obtained from this series and it fits the name just as well as the two others. It’s such an oaky sherry bomb I would compare it to a young, cask strength Macallan - if that existed. It’s strong but enjoyable and complex. 93"

3.0,You can absolutely taste the sherry and it adds to the overall sweetness. Overall an easy drinker with peaty undertones.
3.0,"Reminds me a bit of macallan. Of the 3 exclusives, this one feels the burn of the 110 proof the most, which overwhelms some of the sweetness.
Palate is thin but eventful.
Finish is lingering fire and smoke."
