3.5,"Representing speyside Lossie river

Nose: oaky, malty, peat smoke, old fermented fruit, 

Body: medium

Palate: peppery, spicy, smoky, salty, with water it’s sweat to start but very spicy

Finish: medium long and hot

Note: good but my least favorite. Water tames the spice and allows sweet to come through."
