4.75,A really good vinegar undertone
5.0,"Every now and then you get to taste a very special whisky, and sometimes they live to their expectations. Dalmore 25yo is one of those drams that are super pricy, so you really think of it like ""one day i will have a dram of that""; but till that moment comes, you just wait patienly and you hope it eventually happens. 

Well, my time was at a bar in Scotland, where the whisky is maybe the cheapest compared to any online store and you can get yourself only one dram of the bottle without having to pay the full price. 

The Dalmore 25, released no so long ago, has been matured first in American White oak casks, to then be matured in a combination of two types of barrels, Palomino Fino Sherry and ex-Bourbon. 

But, was it any good? Lets see...

Bottled at a strange 42%abv, which is a bit unusual strength specially for Dalmore. 

On the nose It is PERFECT. Is like a Fig has been placed directly into my nose and brain, by an Angel. Figs everywhere, marmalade, Blackberry Jam; and very young raisins, the purple juicy ones. 

On the palate it is great also, with a clean nutty / almond note. Very easy drinkable, very winey, feeling is very dry. The wine profile dominates. 

Aftertaste was also perfect. The finish had an amazing figs, almonds and wine notes; super velvety, smooth, beautiful. There is a Tobacco note very clean and pleasant. 

Overall this is one amazing dram, that lived to every expectation, sure is expensive, but now with one glass i have had, i can cross it out from the bucket list. 98 over 100, Sláinte Mhath!"
