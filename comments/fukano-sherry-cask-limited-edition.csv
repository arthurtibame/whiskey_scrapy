4.0,"Where are you Rich heavy fruit and long finish. I actually preferred the single cask,  hi times more."
4.0,"Was hesitant due to the Distillate being rice and being a whiskey. 

Absolutely delicious. Wonderful Sherry bomb. Full in flavor and filled with rich fruity notes. Pleasantly surprised. Not much spice or bite. Has a subtle funk in the finish after the sweet fruitiness has subsided, however enough to make it unpleasant, just noticeable. 

Will be looking for a bottle to purchase as I tried this in a bar."
