3.0,"Very clean/clear light caramel.

Sweet buttery vanilla on the front followed by a quick spiciness, pecans, nuttiness, followed by a lingering clove, heat, spice."

5.0,"Just opened this one for the LSU/ALA game and it did not disappoint! The nose is everything you'd expect from a full bodied bourbon like Bookers. Sweet and nutty best describes the nose with lots of vanilla and brown sugar. The pallet is flooded with sweet vanilla and nuttiness, the back of the tongue brings a fruitiness and the pepper I love. The finish is as good as it gets. There's heat (duh!) and it lasts forever like a good bourbon should.  Tasted neat in a neat glass, don't get no better! 👍 Paid $60. 

Super save Farmerville , LA. $56"

5.0,"If you follow my reviews, you probably know that I am a huge Booker's fan. My infatuation with this line dates back to 2016, when I first grabbed a bottle from this very batch. Back then, it was a $55 bottle, and I could only drink this stuff on the rocks. Boy, have things changed. Let's see just how much they have.

Quick stats: This is the second batch of 6 from 2016. Clocks in at 63.35% ABV, aged for 6 years, 2 months, and 1 day.

Nose: Heavy caramel and peanut brittle. Vanilla, cola, brown sugar, cocoa, and hazelnut. Cherry emerges after the glass rests for a 10-15 minutes. Some orange peel, as well. The oak and baking spices are monstrous here. Cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and allspice. It's a potent aroma, but the alcohol is well-hidden. Promising start.

Palate: More chewy caramel and peanut brittle. Hot fudge, carrot cake, sweet vanilla, and brown sugar. More of the cherry; it's sort of artificial, almost reminiscent of a Shirley Temple. Plenty of chestnut and oak. A touch of orange peel. And of course, more of those baking spices: cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg. Dessert sweetness paired with heavy spice and prominent oak. High-octane and highly-complex.

Finish: Black tea and tobacco. Black pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. Some vanilla and caramel mixed in along the way. Long as they make them. And as hot as they make them too--the finish is not for the faint of heart. But if you handle the heat, it's a hell a way to cap off an unbelievable pour.

Another 5-star performance from the Booker's line. I don't know what else to say. Even hiked up from $55 to $85 after all these years, I'd say this was well worth the cost. I opened it a couple months ago, and while it was good then, it has become simply incredible with some oxidation. My ability to withstand the heat allows me to appreciate this infinitely more than I could back in 2016.

I think there are two overarching Booker's flavor profiles/mouth feels. There are the moist, syrupy bottlings, and there the dry, spicy, and woody expressions. Annis' Answer definitely abides by the rule of the latter. Though, I'd argue that it's the sweetest of those that I've tried, pulling it closer to the middle of the spectrum. If you're looking for a more recent point of comparison for the finish, think Kentucky Chew from 2018.

It's an aromatic flavor-bomb with an absolute scorcher of a finish. It offers everything I love about the Booker's line, with a presentation that is uniquely its own. If you're lucky enough to stumble upon one of these here in 2020, I highly recommend that you pony up and pull the trigger. Phenomenal stuff."

4.0,"So I’m listening to the bourbon pursuit podcast, which is fun, interesting, boring, and awesome; ...which is perfect.... and I hear an interview with what I recall was a man; a younger legacy in the beam family-  with a highly highly specific, almost designed southern accent (like some variation of Larry the cable guy) talking about pouring bookers “into sausages” and over his meat on a bbq grill-  I can only imagine there’s a camo hat and a HUGE mess of ORVs in close proximity to this man at all times.  
;My point is that This recording has been burned into my brain- and I can’t seem to get it out. Every time I reach for this delicious bottle- I can hear this man and his southern cadence casually murmuring  “bookerrthss” 

This stuff is no less than amazing - but now I’m haunted.. thanks bourbon pursuit!"

4.0,"Tasted in a Canadian glencairn with a chip of ice

Nose - caramel, honey roasted nuts, and a hint of leather and spice

Palate - sweet up front, with a rich mouth feel followed by nuts and spice. 

Finish - long, lingering finish of oak and spice, but without the astringent tannic notes. The finish is really nice, probably the high point for me.

Surprisingly smooth for the proof

It wasn't especially complex, but it finishes on a high note. I'd rate this 4.25"

5.0,"We all bring have different palates discern spirits for what we like. It took me awhile to realize don't cpmpate this fine whisky in front of you to the best you ever had then you do your current drink a disservice.  So this is  fine expression of BOOKERS to me @ this high proof to be sweet, smooth, & NEATly sipable this a A+, 94/100, 5⭐ But I Hate the Cost $80 for 750ml 😡"
