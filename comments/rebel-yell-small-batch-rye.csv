2.0,"Better in larger portions than sipped. Very heavy in its malt notes. A bit of smoke and spice as well. Not the biggest fan and not what I was expecting from a Rye.

2.75,"This is the same mash(95/5) from MGP as many other notable ryes such as Templetons, Bulliet, Redemption,James Pepper, George Dickell, etc. It is only aged two years but seems lively and fresh testing imo. Nose is typical rye and dill, its upfront and intense. Rye spice carries to palate, not mild this is pumpernickel rye bold in its youth. Light sweetness in the background but dill and rye dominate. Finishes medium, dry with more rye trailing off. Overall this is a bold raw whiskey, its not as refined as some but should rye be. Its a great change of pace from the sweetness of bourbon with its own attributes. Plus I got it on sale for $19 - Its solid 78/100"
