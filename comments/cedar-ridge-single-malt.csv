2.5,"nose Banana, sweet corn, Golden crispness

There are great qualities of a single malt but then... there is a bitter finish that I could not get past"

5.0,"This is a great smooth, easy drinking whiskey. If you want peat and Smokey, or an rush of flavor, this isn’t your first choice. But if you want something very drinkable and tasty, this is a must."

2.5,Falls flat on the palate. Not enough complexity. Tastes very watered down.

2.0,The immediate scent is that of peat.  Strong peat smell.  The peat lasts through the first taste.  Some what disappointed as I am not a scotch fine and this is really reminiscent of a weak scotch.

3.0,"Pretty Spicy, but not Rye spicy.  Not anywhere near as mellow as standard Cedar Ridge bourbon.  Tasted over an ice ball"
3.75,"If you could bottle the idea of an old dusty barn, a syrupy single malt and a boat load of malty goodness, you'd have this. None of that description sounds pleasant to me but I love this stuff. I'm still trying to find a 750ml bottle."

4.5,"This is a two-row barley single malt, first aged in small bourbon barrels, then finished in a variety of barrels to impart small hints of peat, sherry, port, etc; and then married in a solera vat. The result is a very tasty single malt with a very strong bourbon barrel influence of vanilla and a hint of corn sweetness. There are bits of honeysuckle, chocolate, old leather, a tiny bit of smoke, and of course malt---all tied together with that strong bourbon influence. This is quite good, and would work well as a bridge for a bourbon drinker to work their way toward traditional Scotch."
