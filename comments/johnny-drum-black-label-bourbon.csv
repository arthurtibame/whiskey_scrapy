3.5,"For around the $20 range, this is a delicious bourbon. Nose is sweet vanilla and oak with hint of apples. On the palate it's those same flavors with a tad bit of smoke on the finish. Full, oily mouthfeel, unlike other bourbons at this price range (Heaven Hill Old Style). Not as rich as other Bourbons in a tier above, but still leaves you with a tingle even at 86 proof. Wanting a bit more complexity, but can't complain about anything else. Solid daily sipper. 89/100."
