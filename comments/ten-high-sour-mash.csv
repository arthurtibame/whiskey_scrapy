3.0,Weirdly good for the price. Doesn't require mixing but it's cheap enough to not care.

4.0,Has some good bite to it but a bit too sour. Still easy drinkin though!
2.5,"I primarily use this for cooking, but I've taken shots of it as well. Fairly neutral and smooth for a Bourbon. Not particularly strong, but it can get the job done."
3.0,"Consistent, cheap bourbon. Bit on the sweet side, possibly too sweet in a sugared drink like coke or ginger ale, but good in a mixed drink with a little more going on. Waters down quickly with ice, so I tend to drink it with a smaller cube."
3.25,Smoother than Wild Turkey
2.5,"light with a short finish, cheap and great for a cocktail."

2.75,"Good sipper for a spirit. Heavy feel. Powdered and brown sugar  initial, followed by frosting aftertaste. Very sweet with a short finish."
