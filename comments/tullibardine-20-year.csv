5.0,I tried the tullibardibe 1993 and loved it.  Probably would have been a 20 year old

4.0,"Great stuff, and truly one of the better whiskies I've tasted - if you can't enjoy this, scotch might not be for you. The nose is incredibly complex; fruity, herbaceous, and a generous dose of caramel and vanilla. The palate is wonderful, with oak and salt - you almost feel like you're biting into a warm and baked butter cookie. The finish is long and lingers in your tongue for minutes on end. All in all quite wonderful and accomplished."

2.5,"툴리바딘 20년 (43%)
퍼스트필 버번

향 : 진한 바닐라향, 프레쉬 우드, 약간의 금속향, 꿀
맛 : 가벼움, 스파이시가 거의 없음, 오래 머금어도 타격이 없음, 꿀맛, 꽃의 달달한 맛, 후추!
피니쉬 : 바닐라, 우디함

후추향과 맛은 시음노트에서 보기만 했었는데 제대로 첨 느껴봤네요👍"

4.25,"Lots and lots of honey with vanilla bringing up the rear, hint of white pepper and gingerbreadish type character with a nice balance of oakiness to round it out. Lovely viscosity really holds the flavour on the palate and translates to a long gentle finish. Nothing particularly unique but a good solid ex bourbon cask 20 year. The use of solely first fill casks really shines through. $120 is a decent price. Solid 4 rounding up to early to mid 4's once value for money is factored in."
