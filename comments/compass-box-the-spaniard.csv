2.0,"Bought a bottle yesterday and was excited because I love Spice Tree, Oak Cross and last years’ extravaganza.  Upon opening it, you definitely can smell the peanut skins and caramel. When tasting it though it had a characteristic I couldn’t quite pinpoint - almost saw dusty.  I wasn’t sure if I liked it and kept sipping to distinguish the flavor.  I passed it to my wife to see if she could figure it out and she said confidently that it tasted like “vomit!”  I  laughed and took it back and wish I could say she was wrong!  It smelled and tasted like the vomit in the hallway of your middle school that the custodian poured sawdust on to clean up.  I did finish it but had to chase it with EH Taylor’s delicious single barrel to cleanse the pallet!  It may have just been the power of suggestion but curious if anyone else agrees!  I’ll try it again (maybe a smaller pour) and see if it changed now that it’s open...."

4.0,"This new permanent release from Compass Box is all about malt whiskies aged in casks that previously held Spanish wine. The biggest component (40%) is Craigellachie matured in a sherry butt, but there’s a significant chunk (25%) of Teaninich that came of age in a red wine barrel. 

First flavor on the nose is peanut skins, an association that always comes to mind when I’m drinking Sherry cask Scotch. Further exploration reveals aromas of chocolate milk and vanilla. In the mouth it feels weightier than its 43% strength, with a silky texture that oozes flavors of caramel and chocolate Bourbon biscuits. The medium length finish unspools caramel candies and milky coffee, with a light spicy zing that probably comes from a Highland blend component aged in heavily toasted French oak casks. 

Overall, it’s a well balanced blend that delivers a Sherry cask experience at a very reasonable price, especially when you consider the premium that Compass Box often commands. I didn’t pick out any obvious influence from the red wine casks, but they are clearly well suited to whatever role they are playing. Salud!"

3.0,"I’m a huge fan of John Glaser and his entire vision of taking blends that result in a sum greater than its individual parts.  This is a new addition of their core range, and very reasonably priced as well.  My pour was a mere $5, but I think the bottle is maybe $40.  At that price range, it’s squarely competitive with the likes of JW range (not the Blue or Platinum obviously), as well as Famous Grouse and a few others.  I sort of wonder if it’s cannibalizing on its own Great King St series.  Probably not, since this is a sherried version.  So...at the onset, you immediatley get grain sherried notes—-grape skins and almonds.  Taste is mild milk chocolate, hazelnuts , some dried fruits.  A high grain component versus the malt.  This is a great whiskey to have on your shelf for friends and family that aren’t used to stronger Islays or Islanders, or wouldn’t really appreciate the top shelf single malts.  And honestly, at $40, it’s really a good uncomplicated whiskey."

3.75,"Finally, a new addition to Compass Box Whisky’s core range.  After many bespoke bottles and pricy, special releases the guys at CBW finally address the suspicious absence of a truly sherry-prominent whisky to their low cost, core range of blends.  

Hedonism is a delicious grain whisky, but it doesn’t focus on sherry.  Asyla, Oak Cross and Spice Tree all focus on lighter, new and ex-White oak- leaving sherry casks on the sidelines for their more limited releases.  I’d say this bottle is a necessary addition, the question is- does it live up to the CBW standard of quality?

It’s named after a bespoke bottle that John Glaser did several years back for a bar in NYC called “The Spaniard”.  This is an homage to that bottle and that bar.  It’s bottled at 43% ABV and runs around $40usd.

It’s a rich, amber gold in the taster with watery, undefined legs and tiny beads after a spin.  The nose is over-ripened vine fruits, sun dried raisins and honey.  They play off one another quite well- the makings of a well-crafted, sherry bomb.  After some time,however, those notes begin to fall flat and a biscuity, malt note takes over.  The lack of wood or barrel really hurts here.  The quick remedy is to go ahead and begin to sip- there’s no need to wait for complexity or new aromas.  They won’t materialize.

The palate starts again intensely sherried:  grape must, almonds and some cloyingly sweet honey attack your taste buds in a good way before turning chocolatey and a bit flat.  Once again, barrel bite or character is absent and could help keep this ballerina on her toes.  Sadly, it’s just not there.  

The finish offers up more raisins, milk chocolate and a bit of spice.  It doesn’t strike me as barrel or pepper spice, though- maybe it’s just youthful spirit rearing it’s head.  There is some faint leathery notes and just a taste of wood- turning things slightly dry.  I get a bit of what seems like cherry cola on the very end and it’s a welcome surprise.

Overall, the dram does some things well- there’s plenty of sherry and chocolate sweetness to keep “sherry heads” happy, but hardcore whisky folk may find it a bit too uneventful as a spirit.  The price point is good, bordering on great, and I don’t have a problem bestowing praise on John Glaser and CBW for making another easily approachable and crushable blend.  The only underlying negative I have after finishing a bottle is asking myself if I ever need to buy another bottle.  I’m sure that’s NOT what CBW wants to hear, but that’s how I felt after the last drop.  Do I need this anymore?  Nah, not really.

All that said, it’s a solid pour.  Maybe keep a bottle on hand for your uninitiated scotch friends and for the day you just want to pound 2-3 drams to warm up for one of CBW’s Limited Releases.  3.5-3.75 stars and maybe a bump for finally adding a sherry bomb to the core range.  Cheers."

3.0,"Raw honey, butter biscuit, custard pie, touch of orange peel, slight green apple, touch of toffee and alcohol on the nose.

Hot!, warm, black pepper, a spice bomb, tobacco, burning sensation from ginger/cinnamon, slight touch of red apple (Fuji skins) and a very, very long finish."
4.25,"Nose: sherry, pear, honey, cereal
Taste: really consistent with the nose
Finish: the fruit lingers and almost goes watermelon 
After reading reviews: yes on the dark chocolate on the finish, I’m not really getting the Christmas fruits/spices though, the sherry was obvious and the wine influence makes sense once I read that.  Would like to compare to Glenmorangie 10 - it’s similar to what I remember liking about that one."
3.75,"For a while now I've wondered what all the fuss about sherried scotches is for. I like the flavor of sherry, and the concept of finishing a whisky in a wine barrel is novel to be sure, but I've always preferred the peaty, more complex flavors to the sherried drams, which almost fell like drinking one's desert so to speak.

Then come along the lads at Compass Box Whisky. These guys. They've been around for a while now and they only now come out with a sherry bomb, whereas things like Peat Monster and Spice Tree have been around for some time. I gotta say, it was worth the wait. 

The ""transparency document"" on their website says that The Spaniard is comprised of 40% single malt from Aberlour (which has won all sorts of awards) and 25% malt that was then finished in a Spanish wine cask (they don't mention what type of wine. Type in the comments below if you know). They also include a healthy portion of their ""vatted highland malt"" which shows up in all their core bottlings (think of it as the CBW handshake).

The whisky develops over time as you drink it. Initially on the nose you get the wine cask influence, which is to be expected, and I don't get any of the astringent notes that some of the other reviews suggest. The taste is superb. On the first sip I get the sherry influence, particularly the raisins and dates (mmmmm dates...) which I just let linger for a bit. A revisit a few minutes later brings out some of the creaminess of the ""vatted malt"" that CBW uses in their core bottlings, reminding me of Oak Cross with its creamy, vanilla notes, with the sherry still hanging out in the background. The finish is looooonnnnggg, with all those wine cask notes hanging around dancing with the creamy, Highland malt notes. The 43% ABV (lower than some other CBW expressions) is just enough to leave a bit of a tingle on your palate as you ponder what else you might be able to divine out of this dram.

Another home run from CBW. As I've said in earlier reviews, I could drink anything these guys put out for the rest of my life. I love when my whisky makes me think as much as my work does. Cheers!"

2.5,"Sampled at a tasting event held by the ""Sonoma County Single Malt Society"".  I recognize the irony here.

Nose: Sherry and funk right up front, wood, light smoke, light dates, light baking spices, and a background herbal note that I can't quite pick out.

Flavor: Mildly sweet, cherry, vanilla, and not a whole lot else.  Given all the description here I expected a more complex flavor.

Finish: Surprisingly short, light spices, light smoke, and then nothing.

I really wanted to like this as I'm a big fan of sherry finished whiskey but this was just super bland and not complex at all. Not bad but nothing exciting at all."
4.25,"This thing is ridiculous. If I were camping, this is the only thing in the world I’d want. I think that’s because it’s kinda like trail mix.

Nose: granola. Like one of the Quaker chocolate chip granola bars. Little bit of cinnamon, but mainly sweet, oatey, touch of chocolate

Taste: honey. Gentle. Like it wants to be my best friend. It’s just so kind with the slightest little bite. Gorgeous"

4.0,Another solid release from Compass Box. This one is all about the fruit. I just wish it was a little bit bigger and bolder.
3.75,"As always a quality drop from CB. You really get the aberlour flavor profile coming through. Honey, golden syrup, spice, ginger, orange peel on the palate... nose has sherry, raisin, caramel coming through. It runs hot and you get slight bitter astringency (again an arberlour trait) along for the ride as well which takes it down a notch and mars the aftertaste. All in all nice drop."

4.0,Full bodied-just like a proper sherry cask whiskey should. Pleasantly but deeply sweet.
4.25,"Sherry in profusion on the nose, as expected, very hot and with beautiful tannins present. Trifle, lemon zest, ripe apple, nutmeg and a freshly cut wooden background. It reminds of Sunday pastries brought on a wooden log as a tray.
The mouth is very vinous, almost marsala, and flows like velvet in the mouth (in this sense, perfect gradation). A pleasantly spiced tip evokes mulled wine, with an orange slice and floating pieces of red apple. Still wood on the background. It is definitely not the ""usual"" sherried.
The finish is medium-long, very dry, with spices, red wine and lots of warmth.
Soft and persuasive, drinkable without being a pleaser, with those light strident notes of wine that give it three-dimensionality.
Even those who don't like sherried may like it!"
4.0,"Another superior creation from Compass Box. This vatted (blended) malt sources malts from Aberlour. Teaninich, Deanston, and Glen Elgin. These are aged in various types of barrels before blending: sherry casks, red wine casks, retoasted barrels, refill hogsheads, etc. The resulting blend displays typical sherry notes plus a fresher fruitiness; all underlain by a sweet maltyness with a hint of orchard fruit. This is really good. It may not be your favorite style, but there is no denying the mastery it takes to orchestrate all these elements."

N: Smells like late summer fruits. Nectarines and peaches perhaps. Waxy and sherry. Honey. 

P: Spiced fruits. Waxy. Sweet bread, like a breakfast sugary bread. 

F: Quick spice and long gentle linger."
null,"Prunes and dried fruit on the nose.  Agree that it’s a very sherried nose.  A bit thin,  legs run quickly.  Color reminds me of Budweiser.  Honey on the palate and it’s quite intense for the proof.  Not harsh just a decent amount going on.  Finish is medium with more stewed fruits and raisins.  Overall a decent dram.  Got this as a gift in a compass box set.  Wouldn’t buy a bottle but wouldn’t turn down a drink either.  Prost!"
