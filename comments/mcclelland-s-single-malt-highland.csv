3.0,"71% This scotch can be described in one word: consistency. What you smell is what you'll taste in the throat and in the mouth. Even the after taste stick to it. Honey is the main piece of this spirit and the malt its accompaniment. A light floral notes on the palate and a rear light taste of dried fruit gives the impression of drinking a homemade honey beer. Would give it a 81%, but the simplicity is hurting the overall. Still, for the price, it delivers."
2.0,Not very good. Green apple on the nose and a bit of soap. A little floral on the taste and the finish is nonexistent. Boring.

4.0,"Slight smoke on the nose almost no smoke notes on the pallet. I find it to fruity, smooth and easy drinking.  I'm really enjoying this pour. It's a very mellow, soft, fruity whiskey with a slight smokeyness on the finish."

2.0,"Not... Great! The main thing this reminds me of is the ""Fireball"" (or whatever) cinnamon-flavoured whiskey-like ""liquor."" It has an artificial cinnamon flavour, chemical-like and kind of sicky-sweet. Some may appreciate the over-the-top pine, cinnamon, and potpourri notes and, if you like ""Fireball,"" it IS way better so, you may pick this over that to be classier and avoid all the extra sugary carbs in that liquor. I  have had some interesting, fun even, mixed drinks using ""Fireball"" so this in a mixed drinks as a substitute would probably improve them significantly. It's just not MY style but it may be yours, so try it if it sounds interesting."
4.0,Very sweet upfront. Smooth and light. No very complex. Great for the price! Easy on the palate.

2.0,Nothing highland in any way about this.   One of the very few whiskys I can't drink.  If you want a much better version of a whisky with a similar profile try Auchentochan 12 year old.   Happens to be a lowland.  Has a similar character but is actually good.

3.0,"This is what Glen Garioch tastes like chill filtered and bottled at 40% after only the minimum legal maturation. You get hints of what it could be, but it falls flat and delivers disappointment. At $23 for a single malt, especially a Malt like Glen Garioch, it’s hard to complain too much."
2.0,"Off first impression it's encredibly light with little flavor. However, allowing it to oxidize actually improved the flavor, opening up different tastes not distinguishable beforehand. not amazing, or even great. Just good"

2.75,"Lighter-bodied with a floral and honey prominent nose, hints of hay, and, to me, a slight scent reminiscent to that chocolatey air at Hershey Park/The Hershey Lodge (call it specific, but it is just BARELY there!) 

Taste-wise, not all too impressive. It's got a fair grass and honey-like sweetness, which isn't bad by any means, very light smokiness and a touch of oaky woodiness. Add a small bit of ice or a few mL of cold water, and the bite is rather nonexistent, but the flavor profile opens up tremendously. There is more vanilla, honey, and that slight woodiness with that small touch of water. The finish is fairly short, the brine and peat undertones are the last to linger, and they're hardly relevant to this single malt highland whisky, though they are in there somewhere. 

For the price, I was not disappointed, but I certainly wasn't surprised. Great for easing a scotch-newby into the finer things, good for an inexpensive night to one's self, or to share with a few other folks at a time, and certainly best for a break from errands, work around the house, hobbies, or having a drink that you don't have to pay much attention to. Overall, it's a decent buy, but I wouldn't exactly go out of my way to make it a part of my collection."
3.0,"floral but thin after that. some peat, low smoke...no woodiness. ok for the price."
1.75,"The first whisky ever tried apart from the rare times my parents gave me a try.
I remember it being an average of all typical highland single malts on the market - and by average here I also mean mediocre, toneless and inexpressive but it was not too bad.
Aroma is spiritous with faint vanilla/caramel sweetness, a bit spiced. 
Same to the taste; it’s balanced despite its young age, but again - spiritous.
Not a choice for an evening, but rather for a party."

2.5,"Appearance: The color of this highland representative is a light gold, Thin legs stick to the inside of the glass.

Nose: The nose is simple but pleasant with notes of flowers, cut hay, light peat, honey, some maltiness, with some spiky sharp notes in there as well.

Taste: On the palate the taste is also simple - fruity and sweet with notes of honey, grass and hay, various herbs, and I think a random note of pineapple. 

Finish: The short to medium finish leaves some heat and a malty honey aftertaste.

Thoughts: This young NAS single malt made by Glen Garioch is, in my opinion, a decent bottom shelf single malt. I bought this for a friend to celebrate his newborn son and he loved it! (My friend did too!) There are obviously better options out there, but for sub $30, it’s not half bad. Sláinte!"

3.5,"Over the last few days, I have been visiting family in GA. During that time some of the Scotch drinkers in the family have been sharing their favorites and/or their go-to bottles with me and I have been sharing my Bourbons and Gins with them. It is one of my favorite ways to have a family reunion. Anyway, my dad brings out this bottle of McClelland's Highlands Single Malt for us to try and it has been sitting for so long that the cork breaks apart and pieces fall into the bottle. After filtering all of the cork out of the scotch and cleaning the bottle we all had a glass before dinner and it was a wonderful surprise. Neat I can taste a nice fruitiness and some wood and maybe smoke. Over ice, it is even better with the sharp taste I associate with scotch smoothed out and some other flavors moving forward. Between this and Glenmorangie 10yr I am beginning to see why people drink scotch. I am looking forward to trying the other 3 McClelland expressions I read the reviews and will add them to the list of scotches to try and hopefully by Christmas I will have 2 or 3 of the bottles to review. Have a Happy Thanksgiving everyone. Enjoy."

2.5,"For only 40 bucks, I didn't have very high expectations. At first I was thinking ""is this really subtle?"" In truth, I think there just isn't much there."

3.5,"This is a delightfully easy sipper, though it lacks the complexities found in such Highlands as Macallan. The nose is 90% floral, with some fruity undertones and slight hints of caramel sweets. The palate is greeted with much of the same - I even think of floral tastes from gin. The burn is practically nonexistent and it goes down easy. This Scotch would make a great introductory piece for new drinkers, and I believe it would be a great entryway for those currently versed in Bourbons. The sweetness is there, but there is no onslaught of peat and brine to upset a virgin palate. The rating as an overall Scotch is lower, but for the price point, this is a solid 3.5-star."
2.5,"Budget scotch. Reminiscent of what I personally associate with Speysides, so a little too floral for my tastes. That being said I appreciate the initial smokiness presented, probably because I prefer Islay scotch.

Nose gives a light smoke character, with heavy presence of a sweetness like honey without the edge. Full bodied until you bring it to your lips, then it’s rather thin but consistent. Not a lot of mouth feel. 
Finish is extremely floral and short with little to no alcohol burn."

1.25,"This is my first real dud as far as Scotch goes. Get the Speyside, and not this one. The fusels are way too hot, with a burn that is so grainy and intense I had to verify the proof/abv.

The flavor lacks any real character, with the exception of some rubber, plastic, and medicinal rubbing alcohol and some mild dried flowers. Plenty of heat, but almost no smoke. There is a musty staleness that is hard to shake. 

A droplet does mitigate some of the unpleasantness but doesn't improve any of the flavors. I will give this another shot because I wonder if the salad I ate is somehow coloring my experience here, but based on other reviews I would say that doesn't seem to be the case."
