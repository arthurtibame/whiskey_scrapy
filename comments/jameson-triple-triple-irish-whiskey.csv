3.5,"Caramel and vanilla notes, tapers off with maple.  Smells like a wet dog at first, cleans up after a little water and time."

4.0,"A very different Jameson, lots of bourbon flavor.  Easy supper and great price (€22 duty free)."
4.0,"Almost sweet, smooth, lacking just a bit roundness to be compared with single malts. Ideal to have with dark orange chocolate. For 22e airport price, it's an outstanding value!"
