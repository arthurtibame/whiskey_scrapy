3.0,"Review transfer from Barreled from March 2016

Dark amber in color no doubt thanks to artificial coloring. Wonderful oak spices on the nose along with baked apples, light honey and the faintest trace of smoke. The palate is medium light and unobtrusive but still very good. The oak comes through the most and is quite smooth, although I get a definite tingling on the roof of the mouth. The finish isn't too long and again the French oak comes through and with a bit of roasted, smokey  nuts. A good scotch that is a step above an entry level single malt, but still meant to be easy drinking and appeal to a very large consumer base.  46%ABV or even 43% would have really made this one great. 3.5"

Medium bodied with a somewhat milky mouthfeel.

Nose: some gentle fruity jam, vanilla, and malt cereal.

Palate: vanilla sweetness, some light nuttiness. Mellow fruits appear in the middle brightening the whisky. The finish is fairly quick and sweet. There’s a lingering note of vanilla and fruit.

A delightful little Speyside."

3.0,"Appearance: I compared this scotch to its 12 year old sister, and this one is a bit darker; the color is a burnished bronze. The legs for this one are thin and oily.

Nose: Compared to the 12, this scotch is less harsh and richer. The nose is fruity with notes of plum, pear, red apple, dark cherry candy, banana flavored Laffy Taffy, as well as other notes like grass, the slightest hint of salty brine and peat, and this is going to sound crazy, but I also got a passing whiff of Cheetos!

Taste: The taste is smoother than the 12 and more rounded and fruity too. There are delicious notes of honey, sour green apple, salted caramel, pineapple, and like the nose, the slight touch of briney peat. 

Finish: The finish is not as “spikey” as the 12’s finish, and is medium to long lasting in length.

Thoughts: So I compared this scotch to the Glenlivet 12, which is a whisky I really like, but I do have to say, this dram takes the cake. It is comparatively more rounded and flavorful and that French oak really does impart a lot of fruity nuance into the scotch. I would buy this again, and I think this would be a good whisky to compliment a Thanksgiving meal. Yum! Glenlivet, you do good work, thanks again! Sláinte!"

Impressões gerais: whisky doce e cremoso. Não trata-se de um whisky complexo mas certamente muito agradável. O Glenlivet 15 anos é produzido em larga escala, mas sem perder a qualidade que se espera de um bom whisky. Certamente uma constante em qualquer bar pessoal de respeito."

4.25,"Oak and spice on the nose, with a fruity strawberry hint. Thin body, oak and pepper noticeable on the palate, with some peaches and cream and sherry sweetness and a little of that strawberry. Black pepper shows up in the medium finish, along with lingering stone fruit. Very smooth and little alcohol burn - as expected for a 15 year age."
4.0,"This is delicious. The nose is boozy, but the taste has a very light burn - smooth. It's very sweet, but not overboard. The finish lasts a long time."

3.5,Sweet & smooth very subtle flavor
4.0,"Sweet cream, and vanilla bean on the nose. Just enough of a nose to tell you something good is about to happen, but not so much that you know what it is.

As it rolls past the lips, you’re immediately hit with a friendly and playful spice that quickly turns into a sweet and rich flavour with a very pleasant mouth feel. It’s not an overly complex single-malt, but brilliantly executed!

Finishes dry, but in a good way. A refreshing end with the palette ready for the next sip!"

3.5,"Smooth is the best way to describe this whisky.

On the nose this is a very unassuming scotch. If I was blindfolded I would have guessed an Irish, as it’s very clean, with a buttery, caramel sweetness.

The front palate is sweet and smooth, and rolls into rounded butterscotch notes which then themselves are rolled into a warm malt flavour.

The finish comes quick but stays longer then you expect, with a tiny bit of spice that must come from the extra time in oak. 

If I was trying to introduce someone to scotch or even whisky in general, this is where you start.. it’s friendly and approachable, but not boring either. A classic to have in the house."

4.25,"Smooth elegant whisky, on the nose is fruity but you can get herbal, caramel and grapes. On the palate is sweet at first with caramel notes, then it switches to an elegant hotness and spicyness. Long delightful finish. Elegant dram, for the price is difficult to have anything better. Smoke is present in a beatiful way. Very winey. 85 /100"
