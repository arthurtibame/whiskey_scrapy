2.5,"Pretty solid. No sign of young, musty youth notes which is exceptional. With some more age, this should be a winner."

5.0,One of my favs. A high proof Rye Whiskey with a surprising smooth finish for the high proof. Just rated an 89 in Whiskey Advocate and a silver medal in London Spirits Competition. More of a Maryland style Rye.
4.0,"Never felt like I'm so out of my wheelhouse. Super herbal but not overpowering, no doubt this is good but it's not for me. No spice. Alcohol on the nose but none on the palate at all. Almost gin-like in its herbalness."
