1.5,"Appearance: This whisky had a light caramel syrup color. Thin watery legs dribbled their way back down the glass.

Nose: The nose was friendly and sweet with not much complexity. Notes consisted of butterscotch, caramel candy, window cleaner, vanilla, and fresh arugula lettuce.

Taste: The palate was not offensive but bland. The only takeaways I could glean were notes of caramel, unsalted walnuts, a strange waxiness, and woody tannins.

Finish: The finish was medium in length and dry.

Thoughts: I will have to say they need to drop the “Ultra Premium” out of the name as there was nothing really like that in this whisky for my tastes. I’d say though it was pleasant and sweet, it was also among the most boring whiskies I’ve had. I think more time in a barrel and bottling at a higher proof would help in these areas. And also, I knew it before I bought it, but this is a Canadian whisky. The label says so but only really small on the bottom. Maybe I’m just overthinking it, but it just seemed to me like they might be trying to pull a fast one on less educated consumers. But maybe not. Anyway, not my favorite, but I’m happy to have tried it. Cheers!"
