4.0,"This is a brown wax from 5/15/84 and is 7 years 5 months. It is dark amber in color with heavy legs that quickly coat the glass when swirled. The nose at first is hot and peppery but is followed by dry oak, cinnamon, cooked caramel, vanilla, brown sugar and a faint hint of cherry and dried flowers. The palate is dry and full of pepper cinnamon, but rich with oak, caramel, vanilla and brown the sugar. The finish is long and spicy, with cinnamon that keeps the mouth hot, with oak, cooked caramel and brown sugar that fades as a slight dry cherry lingers."
