3.0,Young and sweet :) .. made in my NC .. got it free in an airplane bottle .. not enough to give it a proper taste
4.0,"This is the re-labeled “Old Nick” Bourbon (due to a lawsuit from the vultures who poached the Old St Nick trademark from the dustbin and then got caught in the college admittance scandal). My original “Old Nick” review follows... Made in NC from a wheated mash bill. You get typical corn sweetness, butterscotch, caramel, lots of oak. Thick and clingy mouthfeel. This is surprisingly good considering the age. You can tell that this is young, but every batch gets better. The quality is definitely there."
