4.0,"Fantastic whisky, and proof of two things: one, Scotland isn't the only place that makes great whisky in the United Kingdom, and two, you can enjoy good whisky without breaking the bank. This whisky is a kindred spirit to what you expect coming out of the lowlands: fruity and delicate. The nose and palate have hints of cherries, pears, and a spice I have a difficult time identifying (maybe clove) that all come together in a wonderful way. The finish is a little short and flat, but there's really little to complain about here. Cheers!"

4.0,"My first Welsh whiskey. The nose is light and flowery, with citrus and apple notes.  Apples, pears and melon on the palate. Vanilla creeps in for a soft clean finish. A nice introduction to Welsh whiskey."
3.0,"Really nice, I got a bottle by chance and it is light but quite palatable.

Nose is quite fruity and floral. I have a bit of peach and vanilla. Marzipan is quite dominant after a second nosing. 

Palate is a bit more aggressive and has a more woody taste with toffee apple and marzipan. It becomes sweeter after a few sips.

Finish is short with notes of wood and vanilla!"

3.0,"Gentle fruit nose. More like an Irish whisky than a scotch. Gently warms your mouth. Faint vanilla at the end, a reedy finish. Decent. $70 in Ontario."

2.25,"Nose - Fairly young, his this sweet ethanol bite that is like it hasn't been aged long enough to remove that new make spirit bite, hints of green apple, slightly floral

Taste - Fairly thin mouthfeel, green apples, light apple stem bitterness, light ginger tingle, light an over steeped bitter tea near the end

Finish - Fairly quick finish, lingering green apple peels in an over steeped green tea

Score - 66/100

Final Thoughts - This one started out with the impression that it was quite young due to the initial new make, raw ethanol vibe. Very one dimensional, dominated by fresh, unripe green apples with bit of fruity bitterness that isn't too bad, but kind of boring overall.

Would I drink it if offered? - Maybe

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"
4.5,"Flavorful, heavy on the fruits, especially pear.   Could drink this all day without ruining my palate."
