4.25,"Neat. Neck pour. Gallenstein #11.  Caramelized apples, chocolate and graham crackers.  Baking spices.  Hint of over roped banana.  Berries and cream.  A very fragrant, complex, delightful nose.

Syrupy texture with brown sugar, maple, and a hint of bitter oak on the tongue. Transforms into those caramelized apples.  That caramel apple is such a strong, complete note.  Legs are short with a little linger of that chocolate and oak.  It is not as complex as I was expecting but the caramelized Apple note is strong and delicious.  I can’t think of a bourbon with such a pronounced, complete note like that.

1792 (non-store pick) products typically underwhelm me.  I bought this as a last chance for the brand and it survived the experience.  If I find a full proof store pick, I will be more open to give it a shot now."
