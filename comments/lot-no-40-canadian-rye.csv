4.0,"The current release of Lot 40 (you can tell the difference by the absence of the ""2012"" date on current bottles), according to the manufacturer, comes from the same distillation run as the initial 2012 edition. Which means that the only difference is that this current release has spent a couple more years aging than its predecessor. Given how much I loved the 2012 batch, that sounded like great news. Unfortunately, those couple extra years tipped the balance on this whisky--and while the nose is as beautiful as ever, the taste has tipped over into distinctly tannic over-oakedness. Flavours of sourdough bread, sweet rye, spicy rye. Orange soda, licorice, dill. Sawdust, Christmas spice, wood smoke, light cinnamon. Black tea, cedar, and eucalyptus on the taste. Quite woody and dry, with the oaky elements overshadowing some of the distinctness and elegance of the 2012 bottling. Still a great whisky, but a step down from the last release."

I'm going to need to keep this in stock..."

The palate is black peppery spiced, with a generous dose of oak. It's medium-to-full bodied and almost syrupy in texture. The finish has a slight burn that is easily remedied with the addition of water."

This is definately not in the same level as High West Midwinter, but is eons better than your typical Knob Creek rye.  It's a singular complexity---don't expect anything like additional flavors beside rye ( I'm thinking Midwinter which had Christmas spices).  But what it does in a singular depth and complexity, it does really well.  Nose is like smelling a freshly baked rye bread, and taste is the same.  Great value for $65."

3.0,"A very agreeable Canadian Rye with the familiar spiciness of Rye. Although, it brings in a slight woodsy, almost dusty, aromatic which is supported by the palette flavors. Caramel and vanilla subtlety sneaks in along with notes of malted barley (whether present or not). Very gentle as the caramel and vanilla undertones sneak in with a little maple. Hints of toasted marshmallow by a pine and cedar fire in the woods join the party. Overall, incredibly gentle on the palette and virtually no burn. Easy drinking for a Rye."

The finish is dense and the richness of the dried fruit and tobacco runs long. Very delicious, sophisticated pour."

This dram is silky on the tongue, but don't relax. Smoothness is soon replaced with a peppery caress on your sinuses. This isn't a bad thing. It's really a way for the whiskey to make sure you're still paying attention. A drop or two of water took most of that away making it a bit less interesting.

On the way out, buttery with a hint of maple, reminiscent of fresh buns just taken out of the oven. This one makes you long for Fall.

3.0,"I'm giving this a tentative rating after having had a few more ryes recently, although still not entirely sure I understand the landscape well enough to provide an accurate evaluation.  The nose is unlike anything I've experienced before, with a bourbon vanilla note but depleted of the usual caramel and brown sugar.  There's a little dill or some other unusual seasoning.  The palate is fruity, like a papaya juice, but with a crisp character.  Smooth finish, without many distinct notes in it to my recollection.  I may come back to this after having tried a few more staple ryes (Northern Harvest, Rittenhouse, Pikesville, High West, Willett, etc.), and try to produce a more informed rating."

A:
N:
Wow! Deep, deep, baked sweet cinnamon and brown bread crust. 
Malt thickness and starchy sweetness with overtones of milk chocolate and brandy-poached cherries, like some malted milk ball-cherry cordial love child.
T:
Light in body, but creamy in texture, like soy milk. 
Some astringent huskiness, or toasted parchment flavor hits you and surprises you, but it becomes welcomed as you acclimate. 
Eventually, it begins to taste like burnt sugar and baked raisins on a wheat bran biscotti.
The charred cinnamon slowly shows itself eventually, but briefly at the end of the toasted flavors.
Poached pears emerge.
F:
The flavors blend together into a dull roar without spice, but with just a lingering resiny, tree sap like coating, bitter, and a tad medicinal, but not plasticky or unpleasant.
If you wait long enough between sips, you can taste the full experience of biting into a whole navel orange.
O:
Overall, an interesting drink, some familiar flavors in a rye, and some new ones to boot!
There's a lack of some of the herbal qualities of rye, but definitely the tannic spice, and even some toasted and burnt characters that are not the norm in my experience.
I will return to this everyday-drinking type of rye."

3.75,"An intriguing pour! Unlike other ryes I’ve tasted but somehow superior. The nose is shy and mostly ethanol when I first stick my nose in the glass. Taking a swig and letting it sit a moment helps open it up. It then reveals black pepper, star anise, some clove and allspice, and some of the barrel. 

On the taste, this whisky really begins to open up, with notes of brown sugar, a little rummy funk, and lots of barrel bitterness. The finish is long and dry (the opposite of sweet), and the rye spiciness is there but not overbearing like some of its American cousins can be. 

A little water softens this one up a bit and smooths put some of the edgier notes. I find that many of the nicer Canadien expressions (so not your standard Crown or Club) benefit from a little water, and they’re often bottled above 40% to accommodate that without loosing flavor.

A good pick if you can find it. Certainly a fine expression of what rye has to offer."

3.5,"Canadian whiskey isn’t familiar territory for me. I’ve tried the big names: 

Canadian Club - Couldn’t get a taste for it. Tried the 12 year old and the standard offering and found both to be far too sweet and without much depth. 

Crown Royal - I’ve tried the baseline CR, Crown Royal Reserve, and the Noble barrel 13 year old. CR Reserve I found to be what I hoped the baseline CR would be, namely a pleasant sipper with just enough going on in the palette and finish. The 13 year old is an interesting experiment that I’m not sure entirely works but it’s a totally different animal than the other two and a nice insight into what a decent span of time in the barrel can do for Crown.

So anywho, getting back to Lot 40. This doesn’t have much of a typical Rye profile but its a flavorful pour, much more so than the aforementioned Canadians. I don’t find the nose to be particularly dynamic but I get a nice dose of sweet grain on the palette, the distillate has received a nice sprucing up from the barrels used as well. The finish is where I was really surprised. Much more lengthy than I would’ve guessed and with a wonderful red apple note that just sits on your tongue and has no plans to leave. It’s a note that comes out of left field at the end and was a very pleasant surprise. 

I’ve got a bottle of the “yellow label” Lot 40 which apparently has a different Rye mashbill than this one. I’m looking forward to seeing the differences. I’d love to get my hands on a bottle of the cask strength version but it’s never shone it’s face here in NH."

Nose (3.0)  Fresh churned butter, caraway seed, fresh meadow flowers.

Palate: (3.75)  Mouthfeel is smooth, rich, and buttery.  Brown sugar comes forward and some cherries with a dab of clover honey.  No rough edges on this, maybe but a bit timid.

Finish: (3.0)  Lacks proof when neat so it is a quicker finish as compared to some of my more favorite barrel proof or close to it, American rye cousins.  It stays together though with a nice balance all the way through.

Overall:  Neat it is a bit underproofed and doesnt have those bold flavors I appreciate in a spicy barrelproof rye.  More sweet to me.  I don't dislike that, just throws me off a bit as it is a rye more like a corn forward whiskey. That said, my expertise in Canadian Rye is limited but I would like to explore it more.  But what it isn't as a neat drinker it IS as a base for an old fashioned.  Sweet without being cloying, enough spice to let you know you have some rye in there, and finely buffed edges that blend well with bitters, orange, and sugar.  Garnish with luxardo cherries and it is hard NOT to make the perfect old fashioned."

2.5,"The taste has not much of anything and uneventful. There is no taste of the spice, nor the vanilla, nor the fullness of this whisky. The nose is fairly medicinal and can't make anything else from it. Everything that I am tasting and smelling is the complete opposite from what I have heard and read. Maybe this is a bad batch or something. I will have to try this again from another batch."

4.0,"Nose: dusty and earthy top note gives way to dried cherries and dark chocolate. A few drops of water brings out vanilla, honey, and black tea.
Palate: all of the nose carries through on the palate. Almost like biting into a dark chocolate cherry cordial. The spice comes along on a slow fuse and builds and builds into this gorgeous long finish of rye spice and leather. 

Just an amazing rye and Canadian. Can’t wait to light a stick to go with this. A cask strength edition would kick a##."

3.5,"Lovely fruity profile.  Sweet melange of spices, concentrated stone fruit and a hint of menthol.  This is an easy sipper that has enough personality to make crafting cocktails with it an exploration. I'll definitely be getting another bottle. Good value"

5.0,"Pineapple sour with thyme and mint at the keg. And too many drinks at the Cloakroom, Montréal...all Delicious!"
4.25,At $39 this is hard to beat. A flavour akin to mild peatiness with a smooth sweet finish. Very soft. Easily consumed neat. Ontario made.

3.5,This has very certainly grown on me. After a third of the way through the bottle it opened up and now I am getting a beautiful rye will all the rye notes and spice. This is fantastic. Great value here. A classic Canadian Rye. Highly recommended but will look for the cask strength to compare because I want more oomph in this blend.
4.0,"Butterscotch, butterscotch, and more butterscotch. 

Very nice mouthfeel, but short finish."

4.25,"Nose: 
Rye spice first, fresh baked bread with a caramel or vanilla glaze.  Toasted almonds.

Palate: 
A hit of unique grainy rye flavor first.  Oily mouthfeel.  Less sweet than typical Canadian whiskies.  Well balanced oak. Spice and slight bitterness forefront, masking a subtle sweetness that balances this drink out.  This background sweetness and vanilla preserves it's spot on the periphery of the Canadian whisky flavour profile to me.  Despite this, the rye spice shines and maintains the spotlight.

Finish
Full and spicy.  Residual flavors lingering on the soft palate.  Bitter coffee or dark chocolate.  Lingering oak.

This was my last ounce from this bottle and I wish I had spent this time with it sooner!  Very interesting in its category and well worth exploring for its price point.  I will be replacing this bottle at my earliest convenience!"
2.75,"Ive mentioned many times my dislike for Canadian whisky but...... This is actually a quality product. Poured neat, nose is familiar to genre with ginger maple, spicy rye, bit of barrel notes but we can add some dusty cardboard and a hint of caramel. This has an honest to goodness nose with some depth. Palate is spiced up pretty good. Peppery rye, Christmas, baking all appear with some sweet caramel maple and dry oak. Gotta say the pot still is a huge plus with nice viscosity and mouthfeel. Finish(wait a Canadian with a finish.. yes) is solid with sweet maple syrup and rye drying to oaky barrel. All the way through the flavor and experience has richness unlike most flat weak competitors. Lets not get too crazy its not as good as high quality bourbon or scotch but for what it is im very impressed........78/100....... Best true Canadian whisky Ive had and only one I would (so far) recommend......This kinda reminds me of those maple candies you can get at a trading post"

3.5,"Noses very subtle sweetness balanced with sweetened cherries and spice. Hits with a lot of baking spice, slight sweetness and heavy black pepper, finishes oaky, slight salt and bitterness. No alcohol burn! Just a spiciness that is multilayered. Very interesting whiskey."

3.0,"Just cracked a bottle I've been sitting on for a few months.   This is NOT lot 40.   It tastes like cheap brandy.   Has none of the floral/menthol notes I've come to expect.   perhaps a bad batch.   I did purchase on sale at the LCBO.   It is my hope that this is an off batch, and not a new version of the classic.   I will buy again, but it better be the Lot 40 I'm expecting."

3.5,"Good but one dimensional. Some acetone on the nose with treacle, caramel and toffee notes. A modest burn. In the mouth adds just a hint of generic spice. I'm a little reminded of the middle of a Mars bar or other cheap confectionery. If you like peat monsters, walk on by! No real length but thats OK. I like it for a drop not requiring a lot of thought or analysis. Sweet treat!"

1.5,"I don’t know what happened to my bottle, but this is awful. Almost nondiscernable flavor... very weak vanilla, no spice, slight generic ETOH. I’m really disappointed after all the incredible reviews, both here on Distiller and elsewhere. Obviously something has changed in a BIG way. I won’t give this another chance... it’s the second worst, most watery rye I’ve tasted."

2.0,"Man do I regret this purchase...I like rye's even Canadian sourced WhistlePig 10 year is one of my favorites. I've seen quite a few favorable reviews of this so decided to pick it up on sale at $35 versus the normal $40. It tastes like cheap blended Canadian whiskey, you know the mostly neutral vodka taste with a very light rye taste and spice to it. Palates do differ but if my bottle is any indication I don't get how this receives so many positive reviews. Perhaps I got a bad bottle or something maybe it's the low proof but very underwhelming and not anything like expected for a rye."

3.5,"Nez: miel, bois, caramel, épices, figue. Bouche, très boisé, caramel et pomme brûlée. Suite plus mielleuse, écorce d'orange, noix, épices qui s'étirent sur une finale où le seigle est maître. Texture qui arrache un peu par la céréale et l'alcool mais on s'y habitue après quelques gorgées."
