3.0,Smoky and spicy
3.75,"Second tasting, straight it's a bit hot and rough but with a small splash of water the heat tones down a bit and some of the sweetness comes out with the smoke."
null,"More to it than smoke and corn! Every sip opened up a little differently, awesome finish, long and complex. Will become an inexpensive staple on my bar!"

4.5,"I drink this neat and think of it as sweet and smoky; the smoky, fire taste adds a needed (and lovely) layer of complexity to this whiskey. I really like it and its one of my favorites to sip anytime but really in the fall."

4.0,"As my wife described it - “Like drinking camp fire...but in a good way!”
Light sweetness, medium smokiness, molded woodiness, corn-forward goodness.
A welcome deviant from the norm."
4.5,Wonderfully rich. It's like a firework of intense bbq and smoke slowly explodes in your mouth.
