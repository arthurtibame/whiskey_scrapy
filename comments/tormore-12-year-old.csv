3.5,"I got to say that before going to speyside, i have never heard of this malt. Now i know it a little better since i now have tasted 3 expressions, and i wanted to start my review on them from the youngest to the oldest i had, in order. Tormore 12yo is a 40%abv typical speyside single malt, with fruitiness all over the place. 

On the nose: very cítric. Orange, tangerine, Caramel, Vanilla, orange Zest and Lemon.

On the palate, it is more bitter and acid that you would normally expect. Orange and tobacco. Nice and easy. 

Finish is full of ginger and hint of orange acidic flavors. Medium long.

Overall this is a textbook speyside dram. A normal, easy drinkable whisky.  77 over 100."

3.0,"Apples, honey, and fresh oak on the nose. Light body, with orange zest, some tropical fruit and malt on the palate. This dram ends on a dry and nutty note. There is also a slightly bitter aftertaste on rather short finish. Not bad overall, but not very interesting either."
3.0,"On the fence on this one - it has its high moments and its pit of the earth moments. There are pleasant notes of coffee with bitter dark chocolate, and then suddenly that bitterness over-extends its stay all the way towards a finish you actually which was shorter than it really is. The nose is best described as wet hay, which I guess is a good thing if that's your thing. And if you like unripe apples, you're more the merrier. As for me, I'm just sad."
