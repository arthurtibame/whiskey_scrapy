3.0,"I was not expecting to receive this treasure o. The Heaven Hill tasting event, but I’m glad I did. Not a favorite, but well worth the dram. Butterscotch and toffee on the nose, brown sugar, dark chocolate on the mouth, oily, mellow, melted dark chocolate finish."
4.0,"Nose- Vanilla, ripe banana, fresh baked bread
Body- snickerdoodle cookies, cinnamon, and a hint of those banana notes
Finish black pepper and a hint of mint

Very nice"

3.0,Sampled at the Heaven Hill Connoisseur tasting.  Utterly unremarkable based on the age and price. Only slightly better than the EC Barrel Proof I have. I could not justify spending $249.99 on this whatsoever.

3.25,Was expecting more for a bottle that sells at $250. Strong burn that wasn’t cut well with water. Decent flavors of oak and smoke but overshadowed with too much spice. Not worth the cost of a bottle in the least.

3.75,"Tasting:  1.5 oz. (thanks to my wife not liking hers, thus doubling mine) pour in sampling glen cairn glass at Heaven Hill tasting event.   First neat, then with 2 drops.

Nose (4.0):  Butterscotch, leather and tobacco.  This is a bourbony traditional nose that was the star of this sample.

Palate (3.5)  Caramel and oak dominate with some smokiness on the back palate.  This is a sweeter tasting bourbon that got a bit dry for me

Finish (3.5) Not bad. More oak and a lingering pecan comes in at the end.

Overall:  I liked the ECBP A119 along with this tasting better.  At 249/bottle I could not pull the trigger.  It is a good bourbon, not a great one in my opinion."
