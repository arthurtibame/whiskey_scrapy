3.0,"My first Ben Nevis, a distillery that i have seen a lot lately. This is the most traditional expression, bottled at 46%abv. 

On the nose, Honey, Malt and Cereal.
Very gentle. Dry grass; Hay. Typical highland malt. Caramel developing after the first sip. Malted barley. 

On the palate, more of the same profile, very straightforward. Nice caramel. Vanilla. Very easy drinkable. Cereal and Honey.

Aftertaste is not spicy at all. Honeyed finish. Like breakfast cereal with honey.

A very unidirectional whisky, which feels like a very standarized dram. Good taste, bit definitively for begginers. 66 over 100."
