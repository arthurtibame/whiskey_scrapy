2.0,"So, the positive part of this is that it's smooth like silk.  But that's it.  Everything else about this makes me think it was never designed to be for sipping neat, but rather mixed into a soft drink.   First whiff of this is like walking into a florist shop.  I get a lot of floral, reminded me of Brenne (French whiskey).  If I didn't know better, i would think I'm about to sip cheap cognac.  Taste is citrusy.  Orange peels and lime zest.  I'm not liking the finish at all.  Quite bitter, like the white part of lemons.   Such a let down.  Not sure what the heck to do with this full bottle now, short 2 ounces.   Wonder if it's any good removing crayon writing on walls, courtesy of my kindergartener."

Palate: barley, anise and walnut. 

Overall: nose is so-so, palate is good, finish is decent."
