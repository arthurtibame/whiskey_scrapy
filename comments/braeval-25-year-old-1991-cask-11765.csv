4.0,"I picked up this sample on the back of an enjoyable introduction to the distillery last Christmas by @LeeEvolved. This one was quite different to that fruity Samaroli bottling but equally tasty. It’s a solidly malty whisky - rich warm bread on the nose, with a pleasing hint of nasal decongestant, and robust toasty flavors in the mouth. The finish is long and delicately spicy. Surprisingly robust for the ABV, it’s a shame we don’t see Braevel outside of Chivas Regal blends more often. Definitely worth a taste or two (Master of Malt has samples) and I wouldn’t begrudge a bottle."
