4.5,"Red Spot was originally produced by the Mitchell family who commenced trading in 1805 on Grafton Street in Dublin, and became involved in whiskey bonding in 1887. The Red Spot name originated from the family's practice of marking casks of different ages with a spot of coloured paint. There was a Blue Spot, Green Spot, Yellow Spot, as well as the Red Spot. Red Spot was not produced for very many years, but was relaunched in 2018. Matured for over 15 years in a combination of American Bourbon casks, Spanish sherry butts and Sicilian Marsala wine casks. 

Nose: Pot Still spices with rich cooked fruit, baked apple, mango and black cherry, nuts.
Taste: Ripe fruit sweetness with good dash of spices - black pepper
Finish: An extra-long infusion of fruit and spices.

3.75,Pour it and let it breathe for a bit. Big flavor with that Irish whiskey-specific. Similar to Red Breast. Hangs out for a while. Light gold color. Dried fruit flavor.

3.75,"WhiskeyLive Dublin 2018. 
First taste of the night at the Midleton stand. Overall this is fruity, fruity, fruity, with the sherry and Marsala wine influence showing through strongly. Apple and cooked fruits on the nose, and a klaxon of blackberry and raspberry jam in the mouth. The finish is spicy and sweet. 

Better than the Yellow Spot, but is it better than the Green Spot? Yes, if your taste leans more towards heavily sherried and sweet drams but I guess that’s not me."
5.0,"Smooth and full of flavor ranging from toasted vanilla, cherries, raspberries, strawberries, dried fruit, tropical fruit like mango and a little passion fruit, and pepper with a long spicy strawberry finish."

4.5,"Where the Yellow Spot is sweet and luscious, the Red brings more complexity. I especially enjoy the influence of the Marsala casks, and the extra few years in the wood are noticeable and enjoyable. Happy St. Paddy’s 2019, everyone!"
4.0,I might be crazy but this tastes more like a scotch than an Irish whiskey to me. Specifically the body tastes very similar to ka va lan sherry oak bottle I have.
4.25,"The second day of Irish pours.  This newly (re)released spotted series is aged 15 years.  A brief background on the colored spots: this was a practice of the Mitchell family which would place a colored spot on the cask to indicate its age.  Blue for 8, Green for 10, Yellow for 12 and, of course, Red for 15.  The Red has been triple casked in bourbon casks, Spanish sherry butts and Sicilian Marsala wine casks.  This is a single pot stilled whiskey that is non-chilled filtered and bottled at 46%.  Sounds good so far. Okay, onto better things (the whiskey). 

This is a shiny, new penny copper color.

The nose begins light, fruity and sweet.  Apricots, Gala apples, pears and fig jam topped with confectionery-cinnamon crumbs.  Some more time brings forth candied walnuts, hazelnuts, vanilla and softened leather.  Light oak spice overtones provides a gentle sweetness counter balance. 

A medium-light mouthfeel delivers sweetness, spice and fruit.  Hot & sour sauce with cracked black pepper. Marsala wine notes come through but just enough to detect and not overwhelming. Apricots, orange, dates, plumbs with vanilla.  Barley sugar works it’s way towards the finish, which only increases over time.  There is a nuttiness of walnuts and almonds. That forward spice on the near initial sip subsides in the mid palate and gains momentum towards the finish.  

Slight oak drying tannins remain on the palate and burnt whole wheat toast. Barley sugar oscillates to a diminished amount and hints of vanilla are detectable. The flavor does diminish rather quick. However, the soul is warmed deep with red pepper, cinnamon and clove spices and remains warm for a good long length of time. 

Scotch and Irish whiskies, though share similar origins, are quite different and are often compared as siblings but they really are two different varieties of whiskey.  Irish whiskey has, I perceive, a reputation as cheap, quick hit, down the hatch type of whiskey (I am looking at you Jameson) and scotch a sophisticated sipper for sophisticated people. However, there are those Irish whiskies that are meant for sipping and sharing.  The Spot series are meant exactly for this purpose.  Red Spot provides a solid, balanced, flavorful, sweet and spicy dram that’s sophisticated yet simple.  I quite enjoyed this one.  Worthy of seeking a pour.  If you like Irish whiskies and those qualities, you will not be disappointed.  [$99][92/100][Tasted: 3/16/19]"

3.5,Lots of dried fruit. A bit heavy on the pallet and mouth feel. After one very enjoyable glass I was done. A special occasion dram.

4.5,Definitely get the sherry influence with a bit of bite at the end. Not the type of bite that is off putting. Someone mentioned this is like an Irish whiskey and bourbon mixed together and I can’t agree more. I personally get that apple caramel that I get with bourbons. Especially on the nose

4.5,"Damn fine stuff. Unique flavors, some candy-like and always smooth as a baby's bottom. I drink this very slowly and in tiny sips. A ridiculously small pour in the tasting glass, when finished, leaves me very satisfied, like after enjoying a fine meal. How can anything this good be made in a series of different barrels? A great example of fine whiskey making. I would describe this whiskey as rich, very smooth and polished ... and very Limited. Finally got it here in PA to go with the Green and Yellow. Don't know if it's worth twice the cost of a Green Spot though. For the money two bottles of Green would seem make a lot more sense to my mind. The Yellow at $30 less than this delivers much the same experience, but with fruited instead of the candied fruit flavor and without the uber-sophistication. As always, just a matter of how much you want to pay for that extra measure of refinement. You can't go wrong with any of the Mitchell Spots. This one though is an absolute treat. 


$130 in PA. Yellow is $100 Green is $65"

4.25,"Rebirth of a legendary whisky from the 1960’s:  Red Spot 15yo Irish whiskey.  This bottle has reappeared in 2018, after Mitchell & Sons passed the old recipe down to Midleton distillery.  The Green Spot and Yellow Spot bottles have also reappeared, with a release of Blue Spot due on the horizon.

This release is a blend of whiskey that was matured for 15 years in a combination of ex-bourbon, Oloroso sherry and Marsala wine casks.  It’s bottled at 46% and runs about $115.  It’s amber and warm copper in color (natural) and has oily, thin legs and watery drops.

The nose begins slightly nutty and roasted with a hefty waft of cinnamon breakfast cereal creeping in immediately after the pour.  After some time, toffee and light oak mingle with apple skins and beeswax.  There’s no real hint of heat, even at a robust 46% ABV.

The palate sings of all spice, cinnamon and spicy barrel notes.  Hints of smoked, ginger marinated beef jerky provide the crux of the flavors on the tongue, with some vanilla and light citrus cooling things off on the back end.  It’s moderately rich with a mouth coat that seems thin at times, while oily at others.

The finish is long and steadily warming, with cinnamon and caramel leading the charge.  Lingering cereal notes keep the flavors balanced, although maybe a little boring, at the very end.  It ultimately entices you to go back in for another sip- which is usually a sign of a wonderful whiskey...and this one certainly is.

Overall, this is a fine product.  The recipe has been recreated wonderfully and it makes me want to taste an old pour of the Red Spot from the 60’s.  Good luck finding that, I know, but damn I really want to.  Thanks to my buddy, @Scott_E from Long Island, for this generous pour.  I went out and bought a bottle several months ago and I think it’s going to be a losing battle if I try not to open the entire Spot range of bottles.  This stuff is fantastic.  4.25 stars, although I’d love to see this bottle drop a little in price (again, good luck I know) as I’ve noticed Irish whiskey is finally getting caught up in the whiskey craze and driving prices northward.  This seems like a no brainer at $80-85, but I had to pay $117 for my bottle and that’s quite expensive for a 15yo bottle of whiskey.  But, I still highly recommend finding a pour, at least, and experiencing this one for yourself.  You won’t be disappointed.  Cheers."

2.5,The finish on this has a significant sulfur component that is very off-putting and obscures the wonderful fruit in the base spirit. Yellow Spot is a much superior product.

4.0,"I’m a little late to the party on this one.  When it came out, there was a lot of buzz around it, causing some places to really inflate prices.  If you bought early, you could’ve had this for just around $100-110.  If you waited, it climbed to $150-160.  I guess the pricing of these things is like pharmaceutical drugs—-no rhyme or logic, just based upon what the market will bear.  If whiskey pricing was based solely on cost of production plus a profit margin, we’d not see BTAC prices at the monthly mortgage level valuations.  

So, anyhow—-I finally got around to opening my sample, graciously provided by @Scott_E .  I’m not a huge fan of Irish ( my love affair is squarely set for Islay, Cambeltown, Islands, and Indian).  But, this was pretty good.  Amazing nose of sweet sugar plums and fruits.  Sweet on the palette, but not overly sweet like some types of bourbon.  More like a restrained fruit bowl.  

Would I pay the current asking price for this?  No...not over $90.  It’s good, but I actually didn’t think it was all that better than the Green, especially the wine finished Greens.  Unfortunately, I think the market is willing to pay more than $90,  so either I stay satisfied with my sample provided by Scott, or I wait till the market loses focus on this and moves elsewhere.  Thanks Scott!"

4.75,Definitely catch the sherry on the nose from the start with some fresh fruit scents thrown in. Sip is incredibly smooth on this gem as you get drawn into a fabulous cinnamon raisin bread taste followed by a slow cinnamon burn. This may be my favorite Irish Whiskey. If you are an Irish fan and find this buy it on the spot. You will send me thanks later!

4.5,"The first stop on our recent golf trip to Ireland was Hotel Woodstock in Ennis. It was here at the Woodstock bar that I had my first taste of Mitchell & Son’s Red Spot, 15yo single pot still Irish whiskey. Established in 1805 as a confectionary and wine purveyor, they expanded into whiskey bonding in 1887 with distillate provided by Jameson’s historic Bow Street distillery in Dublin. The company is still managed by 6th and 7th generation Mitchell family members and their line of whiskies are now produced for their exclusive use in Ireland by Irish Distillers at Midleton Distillery in Co. Cork. Irish Distillers was formed in 1966 by a merger of Cork Distilleries Company, John Jameson & Son, and John Power & Son, and was then acquired in 1988 by wine and spirits giant, Pernod Ricard. The new Midleton Distillery was built next to the old (now museum) in 1975 and currently produces whiskey brands Jameson, Powers, Paddy, Redbreast, Midleton Very Rare, Green Spot, Yellow Spot, Red Spot, and Tullamore Dew (William Grant & Sons). Red Spot went out of production over 50 years ago with the recipe resurrected more recently when 5yo bourbon aged whiskey was placed in Marsala casks acquired in Sicily in 2004, then later vatted with Oloroso sherry aged whiskey and released in November 2018. Just as Old Head Golf Links in Kinsale was the golfing gem of our trip, Red Spot was the whiskey tasting highlight, prompting an immediate purchase upon our return of this now hard-to-find treasure. Bottled reddish amber at 46% ABV, the nose is an incredibly robust mixture of cooked fruits, nuts, caramel, and baking spices all swirling in a lively whirlpool of ethanol. Striking the tongue oily and smooth, the addition water would be a travesty. This rich concoction validates the nose, adding a touch of sweetness that fades into a dry winey finish sprinkled lightly in black pepper. A warm, lengthy aftereffect seems to emanate from everywhere, making for a superb encounter from start to finish. Islay bias and pricing has me pressing slightly against the door at 4.5 stars. This may change after a few more sittings. :)"

Palate- apricots, honey, black pepper, mango, vanilla, black cherry, red apples

Finish- Long, oily finish with notes of fresh fruit, vanilla, and spice

Mmm mmm mmm. Red spot is fantastic. It’s like a basket of fruits in liquid form. On top of the fruits you also get a bit of smoke, pepper spice and sweetness. All these flavors mingle together very well. This is a hard bottle to find, but if I do, I’ll buy it on the spot."

5.0,"Neat. Amazing nose.  Reminds me of a fruit tart you would get from a nice bakery.  Medley of fruits like raspberries, apples, white grapes covered in a vanilla glaze on a pastry crust.  The sherry influence and oak from the age come out to play the longer you spend with it.  I swear there is a hint of peat even.

Nice, smooth texture.  It’s very oily.  Oh my that is nice.  The sherry influence wraps around the tongue like biting into a juicy cherry.  Lots of vanilla and hint of that oak.  On the swallow then ex-bourbon comes at you with caramels and oak.  That smoke comes back on the finish round out the fruits and vanilla.

This is an amazing pour."

4.5,"Damn this is good. I'd buy a bottle in a heartbeat. It's a definite 4.25 to 4.5 for me. Yeah it's sweet dessert like but pulls back from cloying sweetness. It marries all the components very very well. Definitely prefer over the green. The yellow in the old days is a tough call. Probably give it the edge over that too. Slight bitter edge detracts somewhat and I could see on an off day maybe I'll pull it down to 4.25 but 4.5 on the night tonight...has lived up to expectations.

Big thanks to @LeeEvolved for shipping a giant sample 15000kms to NZ."
