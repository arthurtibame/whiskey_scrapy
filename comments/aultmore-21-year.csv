4.5,"I have been seeing this bottle in almost every duty free there is, and since it is not a very famous whisky, i always wandered why is it selling so good. Tonight i tried it and now i know: it is a great dram. 

Known as the ""Foggie Moss"", Aultmore 21yo  is an speysider in every sense of the word, Super fruity and easy drinkanble. 

Bottled at 46%abv, amber color. 

On the nose it is a fruit salad. Very clean aromas, easy distinguishable. Pineapple, Pear, Apples; A little almost inexistent pepper. A small peat note. Peaches, Cinnamon and mostly Pineapple marmalade.

On the palate, it starts very spicy, which is not the usual, to then deliver a fruity punch. Grapefruit, pineapple and lemoncello. 

Aftertaste is very different from the rest of the dram. An Ashy - peaty note appears out of nowhere. 

Overall, this is a very good dram, i am actually surprised. It is not cheap, but i think you are getting your money's worth. 92 over 100. Sláinte!"

4.5,Very complex with a one of a kind body for a scotch. I could drink this 7 times and probably pick up different characteristics and flavors each time.
