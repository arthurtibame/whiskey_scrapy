2.75,"Light flavor, feels undeveloped. Sweet, easy to drink. Not worth the price."
2.0,"Nice color for a 3-4 year old bourbon. Has some heat to it. Very sweet on the nose. Taste like vanilla with a drop of water in it. Not great, but surely not bad for a new brand."

4.0,Fairly normal nose for a bourbon. Wood with  tad of sweetness. Front hits with a lot of citrus and cherry. Back end has some heat but not overwhelming. Smooth given the proof.
1.0,"Peerless is an interesting brand.  All indications are they're doing everything ""the right way"".  And for that I was willing to pay 65 dollars for what I believe to be a 4 year old bourbon (I have heard some people claim 3).  

Color is golden amber.  For the age it is darker than most thanks to the higher abv.  Legs are decent.  

On the nose I get clay putty.  This reminds me of the worst bourbon I've never had in Garrison Brothers, but lets not go there yet.  A splash (that's more than a drop) of water brings back out the more typical bourbon notes.  Vanilla, oak (though there's some kind of putty note still on that oak), and maybe a touch of fruits way back in there.  

The flavor has a muted sweetness with I am sticking with a clay/putty note but perhaps it is almost giving off some savory flavors without the salty notes you might get in a savory scotch.  Water really doesn't seem to change much here either.  

The finish is fine.  A bit of spicy burn and it lingers.  I get a bit more vanilla on the finish.  

Look this is ultra-young bourbon, it's clearly been made in a more expensive fashion and I'm wishing these guys luck.  It's not offensive.  That said I'm not sure I'd think bourbon if you gave me this.  It's also not that enjoyable.  I will say this is my second pour and my first one was more favorable.  That might be a factor here, but honestly, I'd avoid this one at over 30 a bottle."

4.0,"Barrel-proof, 4 year bourbon from Peerless. Really robust, full flavored experience. Coats the mouth and has a good chew. Strong start for the brand for certain."

1.5,"N: Butterscotch
P: Oily mouthfeel. Tobacco and oak. Very astringent.
F: Big oak. Very long spicy with lingering tobacco"

3.25,Decent flavors but young
2.75,"Carmel and cherry on the nose
Twizler and chocolate and corn taste"
4.0,"Neat.  Neck pour.  Love the bottle design.  On the nose, I get tons of peanut.  I might mistake this for a Booker’s blind.  Nuttiness and oak really dominate at first.  It does subside as you spend more time with it.  Burnt caramel and jam emerge.  With that oak and barrel spice wrapped around the nuttiness and jam, I am getting flashes of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  That is interesting.

Feels thinner on the tongue than I was expecting.  Not watery but thin.  Can’t escape this peanut butter and jelly sandwich comparison.  Don’t get much distinction off the tongue, sweetness.  But it sways dark on the swallow.  Nuts, jam, and oak.  Decent legs mold into a nice vanilla.  Really drying my mouth right now.

I like it.  If this opens up I will understand the positive reviews."

3.75,Single Barrel store pick from the North Carolina Bourbon Society. My first Peerless experience. Subtle spice. Solid drinker.

3.5,"Spearmint oil, pink peppermint, Appalachian snowmelt. Peaks and valleys of spiciness with buttered Jiffy corn muffins on the finish. 

“X-mas season 2019”"
3.5,"Lots of vanilla, oak, and caramelized sugar. Honey and baked apple on the finish. Definitely some chili pepper due to the high proof, but it wasn’t difficult to get past the heat."

4.25,I was really impressed with this one. Thought it was similar to Noah’s mill. Has a bit of a peanut butter taste. Really enjoyed it.

3.5,Nutty hints as well as orange and cherries. Oak flavor as well. Nice burn on finish. Not as complex as I would have wanted but a good bourbon.

3.75,"A generous sample from dthom as part of the ""whiskey transfer program"".  Very excited to get in to this as I tried it at Whiskeyfest SF but it was probably my 25th sample and I don't recall a whole lot other than that I enjoyed it.

Nose: Butterscotch up front with dark wood notes, toasted pine nuts, a hint of spearmint, vanilla, and a musty note like old library (I like books).

Flavor: Sweet vanilla and dark sugars with some toasted coconut and dried dates. Fairly strong herbal rye notes but not overpowering and playing very nicely with the sweeter notes.  A fairly thick mouthfeel.

Finish: Medium long with rye spice and more herbal notes transitioning in to a lightly drying toasted oaky finish with some clove, cinnamon, and cardamom and then a cedar note to finish.

I like this and it's super complex but I didn't love it as much as I did during the fest.  Admittedly the flavors then were playing with a lot of other samples I'd had as well as my somewhat inebriated state at that point.  At $50-$60 this is a solid deal.  More I'd probably pass."
2.75,"I got a sample of this from a friend and I’m kinda glad I didn’t buy it for myself. The nose was overpowered by ethanol leaving very little else to detect, the palate is boring and the finish evaporated. Given current bourbon trends and hipster lingo, I’d call this a minimalist bourbon... minimum age, minimum flavor complexity and minimum value for price. I hope they left some of this in the barrel for future years. It’ll probably have some potential once it graduates high school, but for now... it’s a kind of an annoying little 6th grader that just wants your money."
4.0,"I’ve tried their rye which was ok and looked like the cork was rotting (some white residue and floaters in bottle) I’m noticing this one also has a discolored cork, but not as bad.
Anyway, onto the tasting...

The nose has brown sugar, slight vanilla, some cinnamon and baking spices and some leather. It has a nice amber color.

The palate has some oiliness to it. I get some baking spices, a little rye, ever so slight leather. The mouth gets a little dried out on this one.

The finish is long. A little spice comes back here that is pleasant. 

All in all, very solid. I would not pay the reta lil price tag. I found a 200ml bottle for $20 to try it out. I would spend more like $50-60 for a full bottle."
3.25,"I was really hoping for more complexity and more richness with this one... 

The color is a light amber. The nose is sweet with a whiff of ethanol and dried fruit. Sweetness really predominates here, there doesn’t seem to be much of any space or oak on the nose.  The initial sip comes across much the same way. There’s a slight burn from the ethanol and predominant sweet flavors. And the vanilla is strong. The finish is also relatively short and again largely vanilla with just a slight bit of spice and heat.

I wouldn’t call this is a bad whiskey, but for $75 I’ll admit I was a little disappointed.  The concept of starting the mash from scratch every time is interesting, but I miss a little bit of the sour quality from the carryover mash.  Will I enjoy drinking the bottle? I believe the answer is yes but chances are when it’s gone I will be unlikely to purchase another.  It’s not that this is bad, there are simply just too many good bourbons a lower price point."

2.75,"Appearance - copper hue, a quick swirl coats the side of the glass, leaving plentiful legs. 

Nose - Leads with notes of caramel, peanuts, cinnamon, and a bit of oak. But there's also ethanol, and that grainy note and wet cardboard funk you get in young craft bourbons. 

Palate - fairly thick mouthfeel, it definitely coats your tongue. The first thing I get is peanut brittle. There are also some baking spices. Sweet notes linger on the finish, along with some funky /grainy notes that unfortunately bring the finish down.

Overall it's decent, probably about as good as you can expect in a four year bourbon. They're doing a lot of stuff right from a quality perspective (sweet mash, low entry proof, NCF, etc), but for me there's just no getting around the fact that bourbon needs more than 4 years of age to be really good."

2.75,"Sweet smokey,  too sweet?"
null,Picked this up as a treat for myself and am sorely disappointed. There is no nose to it and no detectable flavor that comes to mind besides lighter fluid. I'm going to let it sit for a while and come back to it in a month. Will not buy again as this should be in the $10 range.

4.0,"Picked up a bottle to share for a friends wedding and it went over well with the whole crowd. Nose does have some stronger alcohol smells along with vanilla, almond and cloves. Pallet continues with the heat and spice that is present up front but is not hard to get past. Finish lasts for days. A few drops of water and this one opens up to more flavors of corn and caramel."

4.5,Felt Less burn then a typical 55% great long lasting caramel and vanilla. This is high end yummy
4.25,High proof but way less burn then expected.  Great caramel and long lasting vanilla
3.75,Smooth with some sweet notes and a spicy finish
3.25,"Melted caramel on the nose with banana and poached pear. Ethanol very present. 
On the palate more butterscotch and caramel with cardamom and mint. A very long and complex finish. 
Big hit in my railing with the nose and taste of ethanol. There’s everything I want in a great bourbon here, but the aroma and taste of ethanol is too off putting to let me enjoy it to the fullest."

3.0,Some floral and spicy.  Not overly complex.  Fairly smooth with a little burn.
4.0,"Idk if it's the bottle/marketing, but I love the way this bottle looks. It's middle of the road whiskey notes, but they're damn good. The alcohol burn from batch proof isn't harsh at all. Very bright and crisp."
3.5,Unique taste to it. Strong but has a sweet finish. Picking up cinnamon and vanilla.
