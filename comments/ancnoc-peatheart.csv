3.25,"Where the “regular” 24y Ancnoc didn’t really convince me, I wanted to see how this distillery performs with some added peat. After lots of different whiskies I realized that I  not only like peated whiskies more but they also got way higher scores than unpeated ones for me. 

The nose of this NAS from the Knockdhu Distillery opens up with a charming peat that is labeled as 40 ppm so somewhere in the medium range. It definitely is not aggressive at all but presents itself more like smores / burnt marshmallows that are dipped in a vanilla-orange marmalade. It is simple but rich if you give it some time. I must say I really like it. 

On the palate it remains more laid back with a slight red pepper burn but stays sweet like whole grain cookies. The wood is there. The smoke is there. The bourbon cask flavor is there. Everything well combined to create a simple yet nice and likable easy sipper. 

I wanted to say that I miss complexity, intensity and a more interesting finish but then I realized that this whisky isn’t trying to offer an multi-layered experience like that - it just offers a nice peated, young, sweet and also wood characterized evening dram. And that it does properly. I like it for that reason and makes me interested in peated ancnoc whiskies with a bid more age and finesse."
