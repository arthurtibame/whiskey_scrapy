4.0,"Surprisingly complex nose - vanilla, honey, orchard fruit, light wood. Palate is soft, with just a hint of sharpness at the end. Somewhat silky. Flavors of butterscotch, wood, cider, a flash of dark chocolate. Some heat at the end, but the finish isn't as strong as some other 100-proofers. An easy sipper, but enough there to keep you occupied. 3/16/17
    Getting some char and an additional walnutty aftertaste. This seems to be getting better. 3/24/17
Bottled in Bond version. Clean nose - fresh wood, oats, and honey. Smooth on the tongue, some zest, floral honey, corn syrup, oak, nutmeg and cinnamon. A hint of dark chocolate covered nuts at the end. Layered. 9/13/17"

3.0,"Amber color in the glass. Legs disappear quickly from the sides of the glass. 
Nose:  the expert review is spot on:  corn and sawdust, wrapped in honey. 
Palate:  sweet and hot with candy corn and a hint of vanilla. 
Finish: not very long and a tad hot. 

This one is a C player. Three stars."

3.0,"Simple nose really just shows alcohol, but a drop or two of water released faint vanilla, orange and toffee aromas. The palate isn’t super complex either. Seems higher in Rye than wheat, to me. A little caramel with a ton of wood. This is ok, but probably destined for Old Fashioned duty, which is fine."

3.75,"3.75 / 5 - David Nicholson 1843 - 11/16/19

• Nose corn bread 
	• Nose oak
	• Nose vanilla 
	• Color - dark
	• Full mouth feel
	• Mild finish
	• None existing roll back"
4.25,Distilled with the guy who made Pappy Can Winkle. Distilled in David's grocery store.
2.5,"Not a fan of this. The Reserve is way, way better. Spend the xtra 5-10 bucks for it. An off putting kinda burnt nutty taste. Tastes very bottom shelf."
2.25,Not bad for a rail bourbon.
2.5,"I occasionally like to stop into the local mom & pop liquor and look through their selection. It’s a small store packed to the ceiling, but they always manage to get the unique and hard to find bottles. While they didn’t have the bottle I was hoping for, I opted to pick this one up.  
Up front is an alcohol taste immediately followed by Smokey oak. The 100 proof is clearly present. The aftertaste of smoked corn really lingers.
Unfortunately, I overpaid. This would serve as a good bourbon for mixers, but for the price, I feel there are better bourbons out there."
3.5,"After the alcohol vapors dissapate i get light floral notes and frozen carmels in wax paper.  Slightly oily mouth feel, thickens when wallow it around your mouth a bit.  More buttery carmel notes and not too-sweet sweet corn. decent spice and watmth on the back end."

3.0,"Boring, boozy nose and a bit ""dusty"" at first sip.  The middle is sweet corn, through and through.  Pretty one-note with a hot finish.  all of this is, of course, perfectly fine because at this price point you can't be too discerning.  It's cheap and decent, but out classed by a few others in the bargain basement.

Its fine, The End."

4.0,"I have been wanting to review this wonderful Bourbon for a while now but every time I went to write it something would distract me. So here were go. I really like this Bourbon and it is completely different from its mate David Nicholson Reserve. This is a ""wheated"" Bourbon that a nice smooth sweetness and softness. The nose is sweet vanilla and something else like sugar cookies maybe, but with ice, the flavors become very nice. It makes an excellent counter-point to the boldness of reserve that is smooth where the other is bold. This makes a very fine Old Fashioned and Manhattan but it is sweeter so take that into consideration. Around here this is $27 so it is an easy recommendation. Enjoy."
2.25,"In honor of staying out of the rain and society, NO I AM NOT actively isolating myself from the huflue, just enjoying life, I've dusted off this bottle of David Nicholson setting on my shelf.  It's a low dollar bottle so expectations are fairly low, this is a Luxco product and reputedly sourced from various distilleries, so as much as always YOUR mileage may vary.

If you handed me a snifter of this my first inclination would be ""oh this from Barton""  it's a load of musty dusty barn wood with a faint hint of sweet honey and corn.   On the nose, nothing wrong with it but nothing special either.   Taking a taste I would say THIS IS Very Old Barton,  one of the higher proof  offerings and I would probably bet a good stack of dollar bills on it.   Really nothing like Weller or Makers so these are NOT all a ""wheated"" mash and that suggestion is way off the mark.  I would give this a strong corn with the average 25% of rye and barley.   Another possibility would be a HH's Evan 1783 in this style of mash.   So is that bad? No of course not, but it's not a ""hidden gem"" bottle either,  you certainly wouldn't want to overpay for this juice.  Adding a snit of water takes away some of the after burn and mellows it just a bit making it a nice 100 proof standard corn bourbon. 

In a few years, we'll see what the rebooted Lux Row distillery does with this, assuming they keep the label active,  but right now in no way is this a ""must try"", I would say much more it's for the average curious enthusiast like myself, and of course those on a serious budget.   At the worst a bottle of this will keep you warm on a cold night and help chase the flu bugs away!  Cheers and be well!"

3.0,smooth oaky with Carmel
3.0,"Tasting neat.  Nose is oaky, a bit of ethanol, and some red hot candy.  Taste slightly corn sweet, and thin.  Some honey, vanilla, oak, light fruit, and peanut...which all fade in the dry finish which is short, other than the red hots that is surprisingly long lived and builds over several sips. You need to cleanse the palette with a little water between sips just to be able to taste anything else

I wouldn't have guessed this is a wheater in a blind taste...there's no body and round sweetness.  I also don't think I've ever had such a hot cinnamon bomb.  It's almost a novelty at this point..which is why I don't hate it...but it's not great bourbon..it's adult fireball"

2.5,Very sweet and smooth bourbon. Not a lot of bite. The big issue is a soap taste that I get on the finish.
2.25,"Nose-caramel , sweet vanilla
Palate-Rather sweet,oak,vanilla,slight char and lemon,pretty spicy but somewhat thin and watery."
2.25,"I picked this up on a whim when I saw it on the discontinued shelf, knowing nothing about the product or brand. That was almost 1 year ago, and it's taken me a while to get through this underwhelming bottle.

Oak and ethanol hit the nose quickly. There are dark fruits and dusty corn hidden behind it, but they are faint. It's actually a decent nose, standard bourbon profile despite it being a wheated bourbon. The nose is the best part of this bourbon.

On the tongue I get bold notes of oak and corn. The pleasant spice and sweetness I typically associate with bourbon is absent. It then starts to burn on the finish. I love high proof bourbons, and this is harsher than almost everything I've tasted over 100 proof. It's actually more pleasant one year later after mellowing in the bottle. When I first opened it I would've rated it closer to 1.5 than my rating today. It tastes like a cheap whiskey I drank as a freshman in college, which should not be the case for a $30 bourbon. 

Although I love Heaven Hill, I am not a fan of Larceny. I wish I knew this was sourced from leftover Larceny and Rebel Yell barrels because that would've been an automatic hard pass. This is one of my least favorite bourbons to date. Luckily I can dilute this with Coke and Dr. Pepper to finish the last few pours in the bottle. I'm interested in trying the Reserve, but I'll try to find it at a bar first."
3.5,"Very pleased to find this at Specs Liquors. Have read about this bourbon so grabbed a bottle. I really like wheaters- Weller, Larceny, even Makers and Rebel Yell. This is quite a different animal. Poured neat, thick legs coat the glass. Nose has dusty spice, glove leather, molasses, buttery oak and a whiff of smoke. Not your typical wheater. Palate is spicy oak and cinnamon with peanut shell, singed pie crust and a nice smoky char. Carries the 100 proof well. Quite tasty with a looong fantastic finish of oak, spice and char. Has the trademark HH peanut note but with wheater cake/pie crust flavor and an extra bonus of smoke/char. Im impressed with this DN1843. It does not taste like a standard wheated bourbon more like a hybrid. I never had the Old Fitz BIB but this is supposedly along those lines. If you can find this I recommend......85/100....Lip smacking good, Will tryout the DN Reserve next"
3.0,"I own a bottle of David Nicholson Reserve, which I’ve reviewed.  But now it’s time to try it’s wheated bourbon counterpart.

The nose was somewhat muted at first, so I gave it a solid 15mins to open up. Now it has very dusty corn, sweet vanilla, light oak, honey, a grassy note, a light note of cooked stone fruit, and a little bit of some baking spices.

The palate is bitter and a little sweet with a medium-ish body.  There is honey, corn, light grass, wood shavings, and some spices.

The finish is slightly bitter with lingering honey, corn and grass. After a while there is a slight peanut note that sticks to the checks.
 There’s a burn on the mid to back palate and the top of the throat. The burn lasts longer than the flavors. On the flavor side, it has a medium finish, but the burn goes on for a very long time. Not painful really, the burn just covers up the flavors, instead of enhancing them.

Really not bad at all, but many more better options at this price point. It’s brother, David Nicholson Reserve, is the one to choose."

3.5,"Nose... Wheat all the way, followed by lightly toasted almonds. Next is honey, butter, and vanilla ice cream...

Color... It's light. Comes in as a medium to dark amber...

Taste... This bourbon comes in subtle. It starts out with a traditional wheat note, smooth, easy drinking. Notes of butter, oats, vanilla and a very refined cinnamon rise to the top...

Overall... The best way to describe this, is that it's plain, simple, mundane, and not all together memorable. That said, I'll kindly drink this bottle straight, and will put it aside for lazy afternoons where I need a bit more than usual..."

3.25,"On the nose: I recommend letting this breath for a bit for the notes to really come through. Corn and some rich scents balancing between a vanilla or honey with a light oak following. 

Palette and finish: Immediately, very rich corn floods your mouth. Good mouth feel. The richness catches up to the intensity of the corn and is followed by the oak that is now more full. 

You feel the proof here, but the hotness is quite enjoyable with the rich corn notes."
3.5,"Honestly surprised here. Did not like it on the nose, but the flavors really come through with more than you’d expect."
4.0,"This thing has gotten a bad rap somehow. I think more people need to taste blind. 

On the nose: Hints of V8 and celery. Some really nice vegetal notes coming through here albeit a bit slight. Really interesting. A little tiny bit of funk but in a good way. Little candy corn and vanilla. Fairly muted nose overall. 

On the pal: Cinnamon, brown sugar, vanilla, a little wood. There some VERY faint raw barley notes happening. Nice and peppery finish. Oily... Juicy... A metric ton of red hots. If you like cinnamon this might be your perfect whiskey. 

All in all this is damn solid wheated bourbon for the dollar. Actually beat out Weller SR in a blind 1v1. There are WAY worse ways to spend $25. This is a solid 82/100 for me. A little one dimensional, but it's a nice dimension. A bit more complexity and this one could be a real heavy hitter."
3.75,Good spice.  Slight warmth.  Yum

3.0,Nose- alcohol- corn- candy - hot leather - taste is solid- light chocolate - Leather and tobacco- - candy corn- flat finish- leather and oak - solid drink. Much better than most $20 bottles
