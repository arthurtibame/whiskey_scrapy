2.5,"This whiskey has a nice gold color with semi-thin oily legs.

The nose comes off a bit young. There are notes present of caramel, grapes, and a grassiness; pretty simple.

The mouthfeel is thin. And notes of red apple, alcohol, and honey predominate the simple palate.

The finish is bitey and slightly sour and medium in length.

Cheers!"
