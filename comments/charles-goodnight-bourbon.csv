3.75,"Lots of leather on the nose, slightly sweet notes of honey on the palate, if the body and finish were more complex this would be much higher for me, a little tame for 100 proof"
4.25,"Bought this on a whim at Total cause it had a 96 point rating from some nobody...and I totally agreed with him!  Woodsy and smoky and sweet the more I drank it the more I wanted, at this price point u can't go wrong."

3.25,Not bad. Spicy up front. Then I got some sweeter notes- toffee and honey. The sweetness lingers on the finish as well as some oak that eventually comes through.
2.75,A little spice up front. Aftertaste is a bit funky. Not horrible if it’s your 3rd or 4th drink of the night :-).

4.0,Lots of oak with vanilla and leather and a bit of smoke in the finish.  Remarkably smooth for 100 proof.  Not sure why more folks aren't fans of this one.
