1.75,"nose is virtually nil. had to basically put my nose in the liquid. a hint of orange and melted butter. 

taste is bitter up front. some melted butter but a touch rancid. slight tannic note drying the palate. too much oak throughout. 
finish is non-existent. bitter oak fades into a tasteless oily coating. 
I ordered Ardbeg 10 to get the taste out of my mouth.
I cannot justify $50 for a bottle. Bear Wallow is a much better Indiana Craft choice. I'll try it again in a year to see if the batches improve."

3.5,Oily with a lot of oak upfront and butterscotch tones mixed with spice and heat with a buttery but hot finish

5.0,"I’ve been sitting on this review for awhile, and this is the second bottle I’ve been through. I really wanted to make sure this was as good as I thought it was. And it really is.

To quote a wiser and far less endowed friend of mine: “It’s a one-trick pony, but I really dig the trick.” The nose is the first place the watermelon kicks in. I’ve never smelled a bourbon quite like it. It’s sweet and fresh, like I just cut into a melon. Delicious.

Body has more watermelon. Mouth feel is honestly a bit buttery and grainy, but I don’t mind. Hint of leather and caramel bitterness here too, but I’d say the predominant vibe is sweet.

Finish is more watermelon, and a bit of cherry.

Technically not breaking my rule of thumb that all Hoosier bourbon north of Indianapolis blows, this distillery IN Indianapolis officially has my attention. I mean this: this bourbon is the best hidden gem I have ever found in the bourbon world. It’s not my favorite bourbon ever, but given the reasonably low expectations I had from an unknown entity (not to mention the fact that I can find it on every shelf in my area—looking at you, Buffalo Trace portfolio) the quality that I’ve found for about $60 will make this a permanent resident on my bourbon shelf.

I genuinely don’t understand the low marks on this app. Not everyone will find this a 5/5 bourbon. I do, because that’s my way of tagging a personal favorite. But 3s? Look, if watermelon doesn’t eek you out, don’t let the score deter you. Super underrated, and a new top 10 (possibly top 5) whiskey for me."
