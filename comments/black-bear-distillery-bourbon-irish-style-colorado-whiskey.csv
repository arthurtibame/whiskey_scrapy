4.0,"This unique bourbon whiskey is a khaki gold color with semi-thin watery legs dribbling down the glass.

The nose is sweet and full overall with ethanol at first, then notes of candied pecans, maple syrup, dusty corn, vanilla, malt, milk chocolate, fruity candy, and BBQ smoke.

The palate has a watery mouthfeel, with notes of caramel, country stalk of straw in your mouth, Twizzler candy, and syrupy cherry.

The finish is mild and lingering initially, but becomes harsh if left to open up for too long.

This bourbon is made by my friends master distiller and master chef, Victor Matthews and his team in Green Mountain Falls, CO. This is a worthy addition to their lineup and I recommend it! Good folks and good spirits! Thanks friends! Cheers!"
