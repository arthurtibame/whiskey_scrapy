4.0,The malted rye is very unique!  Will add to my library and pleasant rye!
3.5,The rye sweetness is present on the nose. There is funky subtle play dough smell as well. Full flavored sweet taste with a rye pop on the finish. Very little spice for a high alcohol rye.
4.0,If you’re an experienced whiskey drinker you have to try this.  The malted 100% Rye is all quality from nose to finish.  It’s the most unique flavor profile.  I’m not describing it here. Experience a pour yourself.
