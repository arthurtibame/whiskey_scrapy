4.0,"Nose- characteristic honey but with noticeable peat, hot to the nose
Body- well balanced peat and honey with spicy peppercorns and lemon zest
Finish- gives way to sweet honey and nutmeg with a hint of sulphur stemming from the peat
Note- this is one of the more complex Balvenies that I have tasted. I liked this quite a bit and found it to be well balanced."

5.0,"My absolute favorite whiskey of all time. I usueally find Balvenie to have notes of honey and vanilla, so when that is combines with the smokey peat, it's my dream come true. This scotch was the inspiration behind the name of my company and blog: Smoke & Honey. That's how much I love it!"
