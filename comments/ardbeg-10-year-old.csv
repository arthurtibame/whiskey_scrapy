4.75,"Just seems to get better each time, I only refrain from giving it a 5 due to my relative inexperience with whiskey, though out of all the whisky I’ve had this is miles ahead of all others. The savory note reminds me so clearly of a thanksgiving ham, and is prominent on both nose and palate alongside heavy peat. Iodine, rubber, and salt are all present as well. Honey and citrus peel, lemon to be exact, can be found with a bit of digging. Overall, outstanding dram."

4.0,Amazing complexity for a 10 year. Smokey and meaty without a whole lot of brine.
2.75,"good, but a little too peaty and smokey. lots of phenols. taste like smoke in your mouth."
4.5,Peat. Sweet. Getting a buttery note on the nose as it sits. Light peat and medicinal. Underlying sweetness.

4.0,"Excellent scotch and a great go to if you like islays. Very peaty and you can smell the smoke before drinking it. I found the finish to be very clean, with a nice amount of smoke and subtle sweetness. No spice or wood in this one anywhere that I can taste."
4.25,"Nose is medicinal. Camphor. The original Listerine. Bits of wet leather. Taste is brined, smokey, oily, and spicy. Notes of cracked black pepper and citrus. Finish is more spice and warmth."
3.5,"Nose: peaty burned rubber with a medicinal smell reminding me of old hospital smells, camphor or phenol. Any sweet smell is overpowered by the smoke.
Taste: more pleasant than the smell. Sweet marmalade, citrus, ester flavors in the finish.
I would have scored higher if that camphor wouldn’t have made me think of clinic visits with Nurse Ratched."

3.75,"Fire peat moss, candied apples, burnt butter, peanuts"
4.0,"A great example of what Islay whisky is capable of! The pale straw colour really hides the strong and complex nature of this dram. There are notably roasted nuts, herbal notes, light honey sweetness, sea salt and sweet chocolate on the nose. The longer you wait, the more it transitions to salted smoked meat. Palate is sweet first, then the peat smoke hits mid-palate, with brine and maltiness, roasted nuts and pepper. Finish is full of vegital smoke, peppery and sweet, and at some point it reminds me of the smell of bamboo leaves, quite odd! A little bit of water helps bring out the herbal notes and citrus fruits. Just love this unique dram."

3.5,"Meh-beg.  Peat: yep. Sweetness: yep. Bandages: a little bit. Burn: yep-but more than I wanted. To me, it is not as smooth as I would have hoped for; and I'm getting a wee bit of the sherry cask. I'm not a fan of the sherried whiskies that I had.  Gimmie Laphroaig 10 over this; but I would not be overly disappointed with a gill of Ardbeg at any time."

3.75,"Ardbeg day testing!

Ardbeg 10, An Oa and Grooves

Let’s start here – All delicious and all worth buying.  

The An Oa has hints of new oak, and even French oak, with a nice spicy finish.  The finish is longer than the 10 and spicier.  The palette on the An Oa rolls a bit more and is little less brash and is more balanced.  The PX sherry takes the smoke and makes a pleasant whisky.  An Oa takes the win over the 10. 

The Grooves is sweeter, almost a bit of sticky wine finish.  The finish is longer than the An Oa and a bit better.  Sweet, balanced, lovely finish, a slight advantage over the An Oa. The win versus An Oa depends on your palette. If you like red wine the Grooves wins.  If you like bourbon the An Oa wins (I get some virgin oak impacts on the An Oa). 

Rankings 1. Grooves – due to the longer finish and a bit sweeter than the An Oa, 2 An Oa – better balance than the 10 and much better finish and 3. 10 – solid dram with aggressive smoke that is so easy to like.  All so good.  

I’d I was buying, I would pick An Oa.  If if was a gift I would pick Grooves."
4.5,This is my favorite scotch right now. Smooth and very peaty.

3.5,I had a taste for barbecue or something off of the smoker. So I settled for Ardbeg 10. Excellent choice in my opinion!

4.25,"Neat tasting

citrus, lemon grass, bonfire ash, salt water, brine, earth, chocolate.
Oak spice lingers with peat and lemon zest. Very oily. Overall I understand that some think Ardbeg is over rated but for me the 10 year for what it is and what it's price point is makes it my favorite Islay. Possibly even my all time favorite pour....."
4.0,"I’m a big peathead. This certainly has enough smoke to pop the cork off itself. For the price range, it doesn’t get better than Laphroaig 10 or Ardbeg 10 in my book. Bandaids and smoke on the nose, smoke and BBQ on the palate, and a lingering campfire in your mouth.."
4.5,"The light color does not prepare you for the smell or taste. 1st whiff smelled so peaty that it reminded me of chewing a bandaid. The taste was overwhelming at first but as I drank it (with a few drops of water) it grew and grew on me. I was in love by the end of the glass.
The taste reminds me of a good barbecue brisket. Oily and salty with lots of smoke.

Great value for a wonderful experience."

4.5,My 1st impression on the nose is undeniable campfire with an undertone of sweet.   After trying on the pallet it is smoke but more like smoked meat then actual smoke.  It finished like toast with lemon and honey smeared on it.  Wonderful experience.
4.0,"Nose- sweet and fruity. Slightly peaty.

Taste- starts out like an Islay with a smoke and peat note. As you let it sit on your tongue the saltiness gives way to sweetness. Then there are notes of pear and finishes with a note of caramel.

As the after taste lingers on your tastebuds, you’ll begin to notice the saltiness again. This whiskey is light colored and is a mile peat for an islay."

4.0,"As soon as you uncork this, you are immediately transported to a bonfire on the seaside... only the fire is out and all that’s left is the smoke clinging to your damp clothes. It really is wonderful.

The nose starts off with pretty heavy peat, but that’s to be expected. Go back again though, and it presents a beautiful sweetness of ripe pears. Hang on a bit longer and a bit more body comes, giving you a salty cured ham.

Initial sip on the palate is sweet, damp wood, like a pine dripping with sap. 
It rolls into a slight medicinal flavour, but brings that meatiness from the nose. The best way I can describe those flavours together is a piece of meat wrapped in plastic bandaids that’s marinating in a YMCA hot tub.
Bet you didn’t think that would be delicious...But it is.

The finish is long, bringing loads of brine, some pepper notes and constantly elevating levels of peat smoke...transporting you back to the bonfire you started with.  Just a fantastic way to end the flavour ride you were just on.

If you actually stuck around to read my review, you will either want try it or be scared of it.. but if you like smoky scotch I promise you will love this.

Let me know what you think!"
