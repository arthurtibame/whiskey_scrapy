1.0,I have drank whiskeys for 50 plus years and I try new product quite often. Obtained a bottle of Ghost Owl Rye and was very disappointed with the product. Virtually no nose  and very little depth of flavors. I drink rye quite often and rye is my preferred whiskey. The Ghost Owl met none of the elements I desire in a rye!

3.0,"Whiffs of honeyed nail polish and butterscotch. Butterscotch follows us down the lane and onto the palate, where it joins up with candy corn and Sugar Daddys. As you might've guessed, this is one sweet baby. Sweet and hot. Pulsating heat and a ghostly sweetness stick around for the finish. Overall, not a terrible whiskey considering the price."

2.0,"Sweet, strangely medicinal, this Northwest whiskey lacks complexity.  It’s not the only Northwest whiskey distillery that has provided an uninspired product. I gave the NW a fair try, but I’m going back to Scotland, Tennessee or Kentucky for fine, complex whiskeys."
