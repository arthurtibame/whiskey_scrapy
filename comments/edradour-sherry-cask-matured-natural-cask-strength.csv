5.0,"My first Edradour was a sherry bomb, 56.1%abv of pure sherriness. Amazing dram from the ""scotland's little gem"".

Only two people work for this destillery. And they sure did a great job in this expression.

On the nose: Sherry bomb right from the start. Glazed pork. Tobbacco / smokey note here. Christmas stuffing and Blackberry marmalade.

On the palate, it is beautiful. Dry sherriness, So sweet. Again glazed pork. Dry sherry. Blackberries. Astringent and powerful. Aftertaste is full of cinnamon and ginger. Great experience.

Overall this is a 99 over 100. I loved it, i have a 10yo bottle unopened in my bar, 59.9%abv and i now cherish it more. Go buy this one."

3.0,"A nose that is both honeyed and floral, with a palate rich in pears and ginger. It's pleasant, although the finish is a bitter pill to swallow. Literally.

It's alright."
4.0,"Floral on the nose, with some honey and light notes of raisins coming through. Warm and medium bodied mouthful, with delicious combination of peaches, figs, pears and nutmeg on the palate. The finish is smooth, fruity and fairly long. Overall, a complex and tasty dram."
