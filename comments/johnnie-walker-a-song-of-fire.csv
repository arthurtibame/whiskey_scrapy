3.5,A good solid offering nice smokey flavor on palate. Easy finish

3.0,"Little bit of smoke on the nose but not much comes through to the palate. Sweet and smooth but not much real character to speak of. If someone wants an introduction to drinking scotch neat, but finds the price tag or the profiles of single malts too intimidating, this would be a decent start to “break in” the palate."

4.25,Really good! Was not expecting a GOT inspired whiskey to be one of my favorites but it is! Nice finish with great notes of chili and toasted nuts.

2.5,"Smells of smoke but tastes of butterscotch with a dash of oakiness and smoke. Very quick finish. Again, it’s a cheap scotch and tastes like one. It’s a better whiskey than scotch. +1 for the distinct bottle label and worth keeping."

4.25,Not as good as the House Greyjoy but still very enjoyable. Not as peaty as I like but still some nice smoke. Surprisingly spicy with a rich finish. Neat is definitely the way to go here.
2.75,Huge disappointment. My favorite go to bottle around 30$ is the Double Black offering. This couldn’t be further from that. Little to no flavor at all.

3.25,On the noise is very light peat with a sweet spice smell. First taste is a quick kick of hot pepper. Finished was quick and smooth full body. Named very well for what is taste like.
3.25,Aromas of peaty smoke and spices on the nose. Spicy and caramelized tones on the palate with lingering spicy after taste.

3.5,Not much nose. Vanilla sweetness up front. A little heat kicks in but lingers. Some peat at the end. Only got it because it was $20 off. Solid for $24. Definitely not worth full price
3.75,Not a fan of peat.

3.25,"Very unusual taste. The first taste I noticed was almost a smokey, bacon flavor. I also noticed a hint of fruit and nut. It's not your conventional scotch, but once I  got past the initial surprise of the flavor, I slowly warmed up to it. not a great scotch, but nothing to complain about. If you are feeling adventurous and want to try something different go for it, it's definitely worth trying at least once"
3.5,"Not bad at all. Wouldn’t go as far as to call it ‘fiery’ but it has some interesting notes I presume are from caol ila that give it a little something. Easy to sip, good for beginners who want to branch out. Also good for the more intermediate scotch fan that enjoys a decent dram for a good price Now that these GoT bottles are being pushed to the clearance rack."

2.25,"Welk, there is some smoke and warmth as advertised. However, it's sort of an ashy, burnt wood sort of smoke, along with cooked brown sugar, a bit of chili flake, and unfortunately some sort of chemical thing like paint thinner. A drying and warming sensation takes over on the finish, with more of that chemical treated wood flavor. Overall, sort of muddled and basically meh-minus"
3.0,"3.0. Gigantic disappointment. Tiny bit of smoke on nose. Not much taste or body at all. Thin, weak. As good as season 8. Edit-it does make a nice hot toddy. I think it really shines there."

1.0,Bad. Finished way dead last in a blind tasting (competing against other cheap scotches).  Almost as bad as the JW White Walker. Hard to describe. Thin. Fruity. Just bad.

1.0,"Aroma is light and sweet, for being a Song of Fire there isn’t much fire here – Johnnie Walker Black is smokier than this; Palate is also oddly sweet and heavily grainy with only the lightest amount of smoke; Finish is sweet, grainy and where the smoke, light as it is, shows the most. This is not very good."
3.0,This is a light tasting whisky.
3.5,Not so Fiery as they’d have you believe.

2.0,"Color:Amber
Nose:Faint whiff of banana and brown. 
Palate:Thin mouthfeel,banana,brown butter followed by a thin,short lived vodka like harshness. The finish is medium at best. 
Not even remotely one of the best GoT whisky releases."
