2.0,"I’m having this at the Lakes Distillery in northern Lakes District.  Amazing views and equally amazing drive up through craggy peaks,  valleys dotted with sheep, and glimmering lakes.  You go through these single car lanes through some of the most picturesque parts of England...just breathtakingly beautiful. The distillery itself is located in a dreamy setting, nestled between peaks  and valleys.  So...unfortunately, this pour isn’t much to speak of...grainy and sweet, a mix of English whiskey matured in sherry cask. Easily forgettable...but the drive up from Keswick was anything but forgettable.  Pass on the whiskey, definitely do the drive."
