3.0,Pretty good bourbon.
2.0,"Light color
Aroma was of a bit of Spice but of dry saw dust. Hints of citrus fruit and fain vanilla. 
Taste was Dry Oak, a little spice on the palette, Dry on the finish with very faint after burn."

1.0,"Saw this on shelf for $75, didn't know anything about it but wanted to try. Even had a security lock on it. It came in a beautiful bottle, had a great smell (vanilla), but the taste was not to pleasant. Seems watered down and leaves an oily feel in your mouth. Very odd. May drink this just to get drunk or cook with it. Never again."

3.0,"A little young, a little raw; it has a couple fangs poking out in the scent and the taste. But still, the beginnings of a dignified end are present here - happy to drink it above a few others at the moment. I'd throw it back in the barrel a couple years and salivate awaiting what might emerge when it wears down those few teeth."
