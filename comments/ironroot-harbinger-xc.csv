4.25,"Having loved the the Harbinger 115 proof, I decided to give this one a shot last night. Beautiful pear on the nose with a big of cinnamon oatmeal and vanilla. Down at 90 proof it loses a bit of the spice that the bigger brother has but rather than the molasses I get more of a fig fruit and red fruits. While I prefer the 115 proof, this is a really enjoyable drink - I am blown away with the flavor of this whiskey for it being only 2 years old - only in Texas."
3.75,"I have been reading a lot of great things about this Distillery. They have been cleaning up at the spirit festivals recently (including the Cask Strength picking up a double gold at last year's SF Spirits festival). The issue was that until recently their whiskey was only available in the Texas market. However, just this last week they struck a distribution deal with Total Wine to expand to 13 additional states (AZ being one of them).
As far as the specifics on the Distillery, they are based out of North Texas (Denison) in the same region as Balcones and Garrison Brothers and like those two they are a true ""grain to glass"" Distillery. They source all their non GMO grain locally and mash, distill, barrel and age on site. 
For this specific expression they use a very unique mashbill comprised of 4 types of local heirloom corns (purple, yellow, red flint and bloody butcher corns) and rye (% undisclosed). It's aging is also unique for Bourbon as it's aged in both virgin American and European oak (70-30). 
There are two versions, the Cask Strength (115 proof) and this one (90 proof). From all the reviews I have read, the Cask Strength is very hot and requires a lot of water to get it to open up. Based on this I opted for the 90 proof version which is their flagship offering. It's a Straight Bourbon Whiskey and is age stated at 2 years (35 barrel blend with the youngest being 24 months and the oldest being 30 months) . 
Ordinarily that little age would concern me, however, having tasted young Bourbon from the region that I quite enjoyed (Garrison Brothers) I was willing to give it a shot. Not to mention, for a grain to bottle craft Distillery $35 a bottle is very reasonable indeed. 
On to the tasting!
On the pallette, it's very soft and velvety with cereal, creme brulee, toffee and pear notes. Quite a complex opening considering it's age. On the mid pallette you get buttered corn and maple syrup leading to spice and oak finish. The spice lingers. 
For just 2 year old juice it's quite remarkable. Such complexity must be due to the hot climate but also the unique mashbill and addition of European oak. It all ties together very well and produces a refined end product. The distillers say they utilize distilling practices similar to the production of Cognac and I have to say that refinement does com thru on the pallette.
For $35, it's a solid buy. The biggest draw back is it's lacking the depth that only true barrel age brings to a dram. This prevents it from scoring higher, however, I will pay close attention to future releases with older stock!
Cheers all and Happy Friday!"

3.75,"Tried this at the distiller and bought a bottle for a great price.

Ripe stonefruit and berries on the nose. Cherry, vanilla, and some spice/pepper on the taste. Long finish with some wood and cinnamon. It’s a great tasting whiskey for the age and the lower proof. 
I look forward to trying it in an old fashioned or whiskey sour.

Their higher proof bourbons are more complex, but this is still a solid whiskey. I’ll probably pay a bit more for the Promethean and Harbinger next time."

3.5,"Nose: acetone sweetness, corn, dark fruit.

Taste: strong dusty corn flavor and fumes up the sinus. A little bit of cinnamon spice. Oak tannin dryness. Brown sugar or molasses finish. Subsequent tastes you only taste oak. The sweetness has almost disappeared. So followup sips are less satisfying."
