3.75,"This was a gift from my Colorado friends:
I don’t normally drink rye neat or on the rocks, but this was good. Lingering spice on the palette. Smell has some young fruit notes, like unripe bananas. Has a quick finish. I enjoy this in an old fashioned and whiskey sour."
3.0,"To compare this Rye to my favorite every-day Rye, Pendleton 1910, the two couldn’t be more different in terms of flavors and sweetness. This Rye is not as sweet as I anticipated, nor as drinkable. It is a decent drink, however, just not as elegant as the 1910."
