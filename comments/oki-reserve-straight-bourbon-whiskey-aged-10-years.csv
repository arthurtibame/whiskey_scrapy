2.5,"New Riff has been producing some of the hottest selling bourbons and rye, at reasonable prices, since they came out a few years ago with their inaugural releases.  Well, before that (and maybe sill ), they were sourcing their wares from MGP, under the brand name OKI, or loved in Ohio, bottled in Kentucky, made in Indiana.  This one here was provided by my Grand Canyon state buddy, the Bourbon King / Costco Genius @dubz480480

This isn’t as in your face as some of the high rye bourbons from MGP.  It’s rather timid and shy, and continues like that from nose to finish.  Nothing wrong with that...timid is good sometimes.  It’s light, summer time bourbon providing a refreshing peachy hit.  

For about $50, it’s about average.  But A quick online search shows this locally for $200.  At that price, it’s a hard pass.  $50...sure—-If you’re looking for something crowd pleasing and summer-y.  

Thanks again @dubz480!"
3.75,This is batch 15 at 97.75 proof and has a nose starting with spicy green apple that gives way to caramel and vanilla. The palate is hot spicy with a strong rye spiciness and a creamy touch of vanilla and caramel. The finish is medium with a lingering creaminess as the spiciness fades.

2.5,"After another successful fundraiser we decided to crack a fine Bourbon at the Bourbon Charity! Unfortunately while this is definitely tasty, there really isn't too much special about it.... It's pretty thin and lacks complexity.... Vanilla and Brown sugar are offset by some big spice notes on the finish... Nice but definitely not worth hunting or paying over the odds! Cheers All!"
4.5,"Neat. 10y batch 29.  Neck pour.  Caramel, vanilla, and toffee with a hint of pepper.  Lots of bright, sweet notes up front and these deeper mid-level notes behind it.  

Creamy texture on the tongue.  Nice powder sugar and deep vanilla on the tongue.  This is straight dessert. Vanilla frosting with powdered sugar covered berries.  Even reminds me of a meringue.  Does leave an interesting dryness on the mouth."
4.25,"Near.  Restaurant pour.  Vanilla, caramels, hint of peppers, berries and cream on the nose.  Dark undertones as well.  Cinnamon and baking spice.

Brown sugar on the palate.  Followed by lots of vanilla and hit of that pepper.

Love MGP."
