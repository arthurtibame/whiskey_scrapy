2.5,"A good friend of mine was gifted three bottles of whisky for his birthday. This Akashi Select Reserve, a Bulleit Bourbon and a Tomation Single Malt. As he wanted to share a few drams, we decided to keep a small tasting.

I suggested to keep the order I listed them above, as I suspected them to build up in taste that way.

We started with this Japanese whisky without huge expectations. With a rather faint nose, the palate was fine, but nothing impressive. We found a bit of oak, some herbs but the aftertaste was short and slightly oily.

We both agreed that this was a nice starter, but nothing more."
3.0,"Very sweet, a little spicy, finish is brief. Smooth, goes down quite easy. Not a lot of alcohol content in a dram. Nose is welcoming."

3.25,Not much flavor but not harsh either. Just OK.
4.0,Smooth seems to be an Akashi trademark but this comes out with a little more spice.
