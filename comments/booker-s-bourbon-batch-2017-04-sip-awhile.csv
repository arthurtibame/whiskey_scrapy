4.0,"My first bottle of Bookers, and it definitely lives up to expectations. Surprisingly complex for a not so subtle cask strength pour. Tons of cinnamon and vanilla with hints of char. Might need to grab a backup bottle before the batch disappears."
5.0,"The best Bourbon I have ever tasted.  Incredible viscosity, depth, sweetness, and balance.  Recommend adding some water or going with a big cube. Exceptional in every way."

5.0,"Big fan of Booker’s and high proof bourbon in general. This may be my favorite of the past two years. It’s exceedingly smooth neat or with a cube, the usual alcohol heat is absent but it’s not missed. If you like Booker’s or things like Stagg Jr., grab a bottle, will enjoy it. Cinnamon, vanilla, smoke, hint of chocolate. Just a really good version of Booker’s."

5.0,"Amber colored, full bodied, velvety mouthfeel.

Nose: cinnamon and cloves, brown sugar, caramel, gingerbread, and peppermint. Some vanilla rounds it out. Christmas in a cup!

Palate: brown sugar and baking spices are bold at the front. The middle heats up and gets sweeter with more caramel and cinnamon popping up. The finish is big, chewy, and warming. Fairly dry leaving caramel candy, vanilla, oak, and refreshing hints of mint and menthol tingling the senses.

I added a few drops of water and the nose seems more candied and a bit fruity—maybe cherries. Smoother, sweeter, and gentler - the addition of water makes the whiskey a bit simpler but also more approachable. The whiskey exhibits more vanilla and oak on the palate along with some toffee and dark fruit.

Absolutely fantastic. 5/5"
5.0,"Color : Amber

Nose: Cinnamon, caramel, vanilla sweetness, brown sugar, ginger bread, and peppermint. 

Palate: Full bodied with a velvety mouthfeel. Brown sugar and baking spicy boldly lead the way. As caramel and cinnamon join in the middle. 

Finish is dry and sweet with lingering oak, caramel, and mint. ."

5.0,"I’m a sucker for (a) high proof whiskies and (b) peanut flavors. Despite this, I’ve never had Booker’s, as I’m generally somewhat hesitant to purchase bourbons in its price range, as my perception is that you’re getting diminishing returns on your investment. When I saw Booker’s at a bar while on a trip for work, I figured it was a good chance to see whether it was worth the relatively high price tag.

Age: 6 years, 8 months.

Mashbill: Jim Beam Standard (76% corn, 12% rye, and 10% malted barley)

Abv: 64.05%

Setting: Neat in a tumbler while at dinner

Nose: Lots of peanuts.

Taste: Very thick and rich (almost syrupy), with more of that sweet sweet Beam peanut funk, as well as some brown sugar and baking spices.

Finish: Long. Despite the high proof, it’s deceptively smooth, with more of a gentle caress than the forceful slap of something like Stagg Jr.

Conclusion: Oh boy, this is another good one, particularly if one likes peanut flavors and aromas in their whiskey. It reminds me a lot of the store pick Knob Creek Single Barrel that I stocked up on. I’d have to try them side by side to determine which I like better, so I’ll just give this the same score. People claim that Booker’s has gone down-hill, but I don’t see it. I’ll have to start tracking down other releases of Booker’s.

4.0,"So, one thing I expect from my Booker's bottles is that, whatever flavor they are, they are potent when they provide it. The nose is a little dull, which feels a bit sacrilege, especially in the Glencarin. The initial taste starts as a bit of a needle effect; that is, the flavor begins very concentrated on the tongue, even if you swish it, and then it absolutely explodes everywhere with no regard. I specifically use the word ""flavor"" because it's actually quite hard to distinguish it before the aforementioned explosion. Smooth, perhaps even a bit citrus. This hardly matters, however, because the entire mouth opens to such powerful fire and spice that it's actually hard to contain. Sure, part of it tastes like rye, but much more of it tastes like if you ate a full tablespoon of all the spices that go into a pumpkin pie. I feel like the finish on this one (and my breath included) could absolutely melt fresh snow on the ground. This is beneficial, because this would make an amazing deep winter night sipper."
4.25,"Deep, ruddy copper color. Tasted neat in a Glencairn after a few minutes rest. Nose it carefully and behind the ethanol you find vanilla and cinnamon, caramel chews, and a hint of buttered popcorn. Full-bodied, thick and dry mouthfeel. Palate is a spicy cinnamon bomb with lots of charred oak, fresh apples on the back palate, with hints of dark chocolate and cherry cough syrup. Finish is long, hot, peppery and dry. Lots of oak, cinnamon, black pepper, and a little mintiness that leaves your mouth tingling."
4.5,"Strong caramel and vanilla nose. Sweet, with charred oak on the mid pallet. Light, Tannic finish."

3.0,"The nose has cloves and pastrami on rye, along with brown sugar and rubber tires. There's a sting appropriate for the proof. On the palate, an odd rubbery, plasticky note initially. Then loads of spice and a bit of toasted marshmallow. Leather, baking spice and slight bitterness linger. Good, but pales in comparison to some of the other Booker's batches. 6/6/18"

4.5,"This bottle took the ticket in my first blind tasting event. Came first of 15, surprisingly beating out a few other favorites of mine. Really has a nice chewy butterscotch flavor to it. Original tasting notes: ""Black pepper, very hot nose. Slightly sweet as the heat tapers off, very slight butterscotch. Taste wise, nutmeg, hazelnut - definitely a little nutty but in a good way. Warm finish, little woody. Butterscotchy, chewy, and very flavorful. Very slight spice right before the finish too. Very well rounded bourbon - 90"""

Finish: waxy, cherry, maybe peanut, a minty freshness eventually

4.5,"Neat. Opened for maybe 2 years (wow, time flies).  So Booker’s. After Teresa’s Batch, my faith in Booker’s was broken a bit.  Country Ham was amazing but not enough for me to collect batches like I used to.  But I decided to return to Sip Awhile to understand if I am propping up the old batches or if they were better than the last year.

Nose is very subtle actually.  Creamy vanilla frosting.  Only a hint of the Beam nuttiness. Some really nice cherry.  Charred caramel.  Quintessential bourbon but nothing knocking me out.

Viscous and syrupy.  Maple and vanilla sweetness up front.  But it brings the flavor.  Cherry, peanuts, chocolate, caramel.  It really brought it all in waves.  Maple and honey is really strong and pronounced throughout the experience.  Really dense with good flavors.  The cherry on the legs and aftertaste is fabulous and lingers.

It’s amazing.  I struggle with Booker’s now due to the inconsistency and price gouging but it’s nice to know I wasn’t crazy to fall in love in the first place.  In my top 5 favorite Booker batches of all time."
4.5,Damn good

3.75,"Nose is vanilla, simple syrup, sour cherries, and rye.  The palate is vanilla and sour cherries with a totally mouth-watering mid-palate, finishing with spice, pepper, and the ABV.  Although having similar ABVs [64.05% and 64.2%], the Booker's delivers much less heat than the Stagg Jr Batch 13.  A bit of dryness, OK - but again, quieter when compared to the Stagg Jr. or even the Russell Reserve Single Barrel.  Adding a half-teaspoon of water accentuates the sweet bourbon notes, and imparts the finish with hints of licorice, mint, and cherry cola.  Adding a second splash of water, and the density of flavors coalesce into something great.  

It's too bad it's spring, however, for this is the spiciest bourbon I've had by far, and it might've been so much better during the winter months.

4.0,"Found a 'dusty' of this in 2019, have been enjoying over the last couple of months.

Nose - Caramel, vanilla, charred oak, leather, apple, pear, cinnamon, nutmeg, peanut. Pretty standard Booker's nose.

Palate - Thick, full bodied. Dark brown sugar, lots of vanilla. Roasted peanuts. Lots of cinnamon and baking spices on the finish along with sweet oak.

This was really good- rich, sweet, and spicy with a nice finish. Not super complex (particularly the nose), but the flavors are intense enough to make up for it."

Eucalyptus shows up with strong peanut on the finish. Sweetness is still there but not overpowering. Stays on the palette for a while and fades to slight oak."
