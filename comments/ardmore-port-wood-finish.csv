4.0,"This isn't your typical Highland, and that's not a bad thing. It also doesn't come across as a 12-year-old, showing great maturity and complexity. Lastly, you could have fooled me that it has a port wood finish, because while certainly fruity and sweet to the finish, port is simply not what comes to mind. The nose is perplexingly peated, with a touch of caramel and lemons. The palate is the real kicker, with elements of salt , sugar and hazelnut (like a delicious sweet and salty treat). The finish sustains and carries itself, leaving you for minutes on end with sweetness that then becomes savory salt. This is really good!"

3.5,"Definitively not what i expected from one distillery that i usually love, i guess there is a exception for each rule. Well, it is not something that really surprises me, since i am not a fond fan of portwood finishes or maturation. 

Bottled at 46% abv, a reddish beautiful color.

On the nose: Ashtray smoke, Grapefruit. Thick Orange Caramel. The aroma feels dusty / powdered.
Mineral water. It actually does not have a powerful aroma. Wet cardboard
More Thick caramel after first sip.

On the palate it gets a little better, but it is kind of boring. Pepper. Orange
Caramel. Port wine sweetness; It is more oaky than winey  Very light, easy to drink. It is sweet without any alcohol note. 

Aftertaste is good, definitively the best oart without been anything special. Nice mouthfeel at the end. Ashy, Ginger; Not overly peated.

Overall this is not the best dram i have ever had from this distillery. It is ok at best. 74 over 100, forgettable."

3.5,"Quite good.  Sweet and smooth, I'm getting some peat but it's hard to say if that's from the Bunnyrabbit (whatever) that I just sampled (although I deliberately cleared my palate).  At any rate, this is pretty good, but there may be better for the price."
3.5,"Good highlands scotch, but still has a bit too much of a peat taste.  I think there are better highlands scotches for the money."
