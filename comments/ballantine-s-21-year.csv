3.0,"Great nose well rounded sugar cookie, brown sugar and hay. Palate is very sweet, very rounded off flavors with a hint of smoke. Not aggressive or spiky. Short finish."

3.0,"Very smooth and creamy, with a pronounced oak note at the end, along with pleasant spice.  1/27/17
The oak note mellowed out just a bit, and the spice kicked up just a notch. 11/6/17"

4.5,"Continuing my old Ballantine's experience i now give you my review of the 21yo one, i know i started with the 30yo, but that one got a perfect score so that is why i started there, because of my emotion of having enjoyed a nice dram.

This one was also great, but its not near the 30yo. Still the notes on this one were so clean and easy, truly delicious.

Bottled at 40%abv

On the nose, Candy, Impalpable sugar, Red apples, Sider; that outstanding Orange note, fresh orange juice, fresh orange peel. That Vanilla note from all ballantine's was also present.

On the palate a little straightforward but in a fancy and delightful way, milk chocolate and prunes. 

Aftertaste was long and ashy, with hints of wood smoke. Nice.

Overall this dram is excelent and deserves a score of 90 over 100."
