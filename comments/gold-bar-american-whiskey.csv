3.25,"Warm in the mouth. heavy vanilla, slightly finish, though not unbearably so. Others said it - good enough whiskey, if it weren’t for the packaging it probably wouldn’t stand out. Will probably but again to share with the boys."

3.0,"Bright gold is the color of this whiskey, and I would expect nothing less! The glass walls also show thick watery legs.

The nose is sweet but not overly complex. I detect notes of dusty corn, candied walnuts, yogurt covered raisins, cotton candy, and a faint ethanol scent.

The palate has a watery mouthfeel, with notes of sweet corn, grape skins, cracked pepper, and Spree candy.

The finish is of medium length and ends kind of peppery.

I will agree with Distiller’s Jacob Grier when he says this whiskey is, “more glam than dram.” It is a fancy package and a gimmicky finishing process, but that does make one feel this whiskey is special and makes the moments worth celebrating more memorable. As an example, I poured a dram of this for myself when my wife and I brought our daughter, Jane, home for the first time after she was born the other day! It may not be the best whiskey, but the moment made it special. Would I buy it again, probably not. But it made for a nice memory. Thanks Gold Bar. And Cheers to baby Jane!"

Overall, a relatively unremarkable whiskey."

5.0,I like the high rye in this blended whiskey
5.0,A pleasant everyday sip. Gentle body and subtle fruit notes from wine barrel finishing. Recommend.
1.0,"My wife bought me a bottle ... I would not mix this with coke because it would ruin the coke...

I have to say I have not tasted anything like this in my life and I have tasted a lot, both good and bad. This has achieved a whole new level of bad...

This should not be allowed to be called whisky !!!"
1.0,"Absolute rubbish, this is pure junk and only ended up in my house because the women fell for its Bling Allure... Yuck"

null,"The mash bill is 88% corn, 9% rye, 3% barley - important distinction to make. (Currently the Distiller Review is inaccurate.)"
