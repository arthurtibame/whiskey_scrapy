2.0,Very rough and unrefined. Strong nose that burns through the finish
4.25,Very sweet and floral.  Very different from other Japanese whiskies but overall enjoyable.

3.5,Wow! Is this whisky? That was my first impression. Super strong floral notes that make you wonder if this is gin or something else. Definitely an interesting dram but not sure it will be a huge hit amongst traditional Japanese whisky drinkers. Try it at a bar first!

3.5,very similar to the akkeshi mizunara release this year but more bang for your buck. good if you want to try a very mizunara forward whisky. reminds me of the mizunara-cask component whisky i tried at the yamazaki distillery -good but a little bit one-note.
3.0,Very different taste profile here. Does not feel Japanese at all and instead feels a little like TN whisky. Very sweet.
