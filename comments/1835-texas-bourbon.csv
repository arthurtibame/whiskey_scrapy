1.0,"As a Texan this bourbon is a disgrace to the name.  It was recommended by a Spec's store employee as a ""great bourbon"" for the price.  I'm totally disappointed.  I'll save it for drunk friends that don't know good bourbon from bad."

4.0,I enjoyed it straight with ice. Not a huge jack fan straight up. Worth the $20 I drink it regularly.

2.0,Very mediocre. Little smokey. No sweetness. Not a fan of saying it's a TX Bourbon but is only bottled in TX.

2.0,"The packing is the best part of this bourbon... Lackluster. 2.5/5 at best. Not worth the the $25-30 price tag. At $15, this might be a solid choice. Would recommend Buffalo Trace to anyone else considering this."

5.0,Nice bourbon.  A little sweet and great neat..  Better than Jack.  A lot like Knob Creek..
3.0,"A decent bourbon, it has a lot of cinnamon on the nose and cinnamon, nutmeg, and slightly sweet candied pecan on the palette. Good but a bit one-dimensional."

2.0,Always on sale should be the first clue this is unforgettable.  Fine for mixing with coke but served neat there are far better options available.

4.0,"This shows the pride of Texas and the tasts shows to be true.  A very fine burbon and it shows that it is made in small batches.  This is a fine burbon that only a micro distiler can do.  What out Colorado, Texas is in the game.  Two of my favorite states for whiskey."

1.0,I honestly hated it! I bought it because the sales person on the floor said it was awesome and honestly it's trash. I took it to my friends and left it on the table. Y'all have this..

2.0,"Not Bad, Not great. was relegated to being used to cook with. Also worth noting that the label says its Made In Texas. However this is a flat out lie. Wont buy again for this reason alone."

I have had this s before and it was as good for mixers with coke for the price."

1.0,Nose was much like a classic bourbon and I figured it be solid however it was super harsh on the palate so much so I didn’t want to finish the drink. Also very misleading claiming to be a Texas whiskey yet sourced. I won’t by another chance

1.0,eh not for me
3.0,Needs a couple rocks and a splash of water.
4.0,Extremely smooth. Full body. Caramel. Some spices. Honestly tastes like bourbon and rum got married.
0.5,"Terrible taste, label is misleading claiming Texas made but it is distilled in Kentucky. Not even worth keeping as a mixer."
