3.0,"Long overdue review of this one---courtesy of my friend Lee, who provided a sample as part of Round 1 in our little Scotland distillery sampling.   Jura is a strange little distillery.  Sort of like that weird uncle we all have.  ( we all have one of those  uncles...if you don't, you're probably that uncle...;-) .  Strange in the sense that I find Jura all over the place, without a real identity.  I'm not sure it knows what it wants to be when it grows up.  I found this 10 yr old not unpleasant ( yes, double negative...), almost an inviting nose and taste.  But, the finish...my god, it's like having a piece of that white portion on lemons.  Bitter.  If you had $55 to spend, this might not be the smart buy.  Might want to look elsewhere.  It's decent...but, can do much better elsewhere at this price point."

The palate has malt and a pleasant amount of smoke.  I can taste the sherry.  It's got a bit of pepper, more white pepper than black, and brine.

The body is light, but not in a bad way, it carries the coastal flavors nicely.

There is a decent amount going on here- the balance is not perfect, but there is a lot to like - it's got a lingering, intense, salty finish, and that is just fine by me.  It's a good drink for a cool fall day."

4.0,"I have the new formulation at 80 pf. Still is quite oily with good coating in glass and mouthfeel despite proof. Poured neat, nose is salty smoke, dry oak,coffee bean and malty dough. Palate continues this ending up tasting like a soft pretzel laced with coffee beans cooked in a smoker fueled with seasoned oak then heavily salted. Not a lot of sweet notes, some good malt presence, maybe a shimmer of pineapple similar to HP12 but then its gone. Finish is long with more salty pretzel, malt, coffee grounds and wood with cigar leaf lingering. Its kind of in the Bowmore profile but still a bit different and for sure better. Its unique and quite good but not elite imo. Lap 10 and Ard 10 are better in same range but I wouldn't mind having this around......87/100...........bottle is great too, makes for an easy pour with the shape. Update: after several pours and bottle being opened this keeps improving. The smoke and malt have thickened up with the coffee influence really shining. I think this is right there with Highland Park . Flat out recommend to those who enjoy smoky scotch and coffee notes. Score increases to solid 90/100"

3.25,"This tasting for Jura 10 Year is another “impressions” review as it was a public tasting while at a work event. I’ve seen a bit of mistrust for this distillery due to inconsistent releases. What better way to provide an advantage to this questionable dram than by trying it for free and preceding it with Johnnie Walker Black?  This event had an odd spirits selection to be sure....

Jura 10 consists of a mixture of peated and unpeated whiskies which are matured in bourbon barrels and finished in ex-oloroso sherry butts. It’s colored, chill-filtered, and bottled at 40% ABV. 

On the nose, there’s lightly medicinal peat and smoke. Sweet fruits (berry-like), heather, and coffee grounds. The palate amplifies these and adds a bit of spice, sea breeze, leather, cacao notes, and velvety tannins. It has decent mouthfeel, but in no way compares to the richness or intensity of many of its Islay neighbors. “Decent” in this case means, “wow, that’s not as weak as I was expecting for 40% ABV” - it’d be nice to see this higher. Finish is sweet, smokey, and a carries a bit of spice. I feel like this dram has more in common (character and flavor-wise) with some drams from the Highlands than nearby Islay. 

I think a bottle of this used to be quite expensive/overpriced, on the order of $50-$60. It looks like that has come down a bit, and can now be found for around $40-$45 (who knows how long that will last as the tariff effect trickles in).  That puts it on par with Laphroaig 10, which is delicious and exquisite but also challenging. If you seek a less complex hybrid between Islay and the Highlands and want to try something new, perhaps seek this out if you can find it around the $40 mark and have tempered expectations.

3.25,"When dining at a local restaurant which we last visited before I started appreciating Whisky, I was happily surprised of their small, but qualitative whisky menu. Besides Talisker 10, Lagavulin 16 and Dalwhinnie 15, they also carried the Jura 10 - one I hadn’t tried before. 

The nose was pleasant, a bit fruity, but with a whiff of peat smoke. The taste was similar, perhaps a tad more fruits, with some slight coffee notes. Some sweet chocolate. The aftertaste lingers on for a decent while, with the sweet notes giving way for the smoky notes after a few moments. 

Not a very complex dram, but very approachable. I enjoyed it. 
The level of peat smoke is somewhat similar to the Talisker 10."

4.0,"Nose: Black and green tea.  Smoke, wet earth, cloves, lemon oil.  Flour, salt - Play-Doh comes to mind.  Sweet floral notes.  Leather, cocoa, dusty books.  Apples, ginger, 

Palate: Black tea, smoke, tannin, oak, brown sugar, vanilla, strawberries.  Mildly sweet.  Super buried ash notes.  Char.  Moss.  Slight brine.  Coffee grinds.  Finish begins with a pause - no pop of flavors here, likely due to the lower proof.  Mouthfeel is moderate.  Things slowly ramp up to reveal earth, vanilla, oak, smoke, mild peat, and Hershey's milk chocolate.  The earth, vanilla, and smoke hang out while orange oil and pine oil notes show up in the background.  Things slowly fade away.  Medium-long finish, though not a ton of evolution throughout.

Other notes: Under the weather today, so my senses of smell and taste aren't at the top of their game.  That being said, I like this.  It might be a little less intense and bold compared to my usual leanings (Ardbeg has ruined me for peated Scotch), there's still a subtle complexity going on here that isn't disinteresting.  Excited to see what I'm missing when I'm back in action 100%."

Nose: caramelized pears and peaches, bubble gum berries and of course a hint of smoke.

Palate:  Oilier than I recall from previous sips, and spicier as well, not just in the finish. There more you sip, the more prevalent the smoke becomes, as well as the vanilla.

Finish: bitter cacao nibs, slight peppery spice and Peat smoke."

4.25,"Right off the bat the nose is molasses with a hint of butterscotch. The smoke is really just a puff but it does come through. Some black pepper that mingles with the inside of a sherry cask. Vanilla bean. There is a surprising chocolate and coffee base that comes at the tail end that I wasn't expecting. The nose is a lot more complex than I gave a credit for initially.

The first taste that I'm getting is those oloroso sherry casks: it's a sweet and rounded flavor but with just a hint of bitterness at the tail end.that flavor morphs into plums and stone fruits on the sides of the tongue. There is a tannic puckery flavor that comes through on the bottom of the tongue.The flavors are a combination of sweet and prickly spice. It is really a beautiful taste and one that I think you need to really sit with and ponder before you can truly appreciate it.

The finish is sweet cherry and sour sherry. The barrel aging comes through at just the right strength: It is not too overpowering but it is not weak either. Just a touch of tobacco and smoke at the very end. I am incredibly impressed with this scotch and I feel like I gave it short shrift on my first taste of it."

3.5,"Mild peat aroma with a bit of cherry and oak. Smooth, soft texture, with a slightly peaty bitter aftertaste. Not overly sweet or spicy."
3.0,"Upfront this whisky is like a smoky spicy sherry.  The first hit is spiced raisins, vanilla and chocolate.  It slowly develops into a sweet, smoky dram with a long finish.

Overall, it is a little harsh and the smokiness is a little jarring with the spicy, smoky finish.  It’s pretty drinkable, but there are better whiskies at the price point.  Possibly one for people used to a Speyside sherry-bomb who want to experiment with some of the strong Islay flavours, but with something a little more familiar to them."
