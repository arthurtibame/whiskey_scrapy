4.25,"Neat.  Picnic Basket pick.  Buttery vanilla, honey, sweet corn, apricot.  Mostly these high bright notes but there is this mocha behind the scenes creeping around.  Hint of dill that I would usually associate with a rye. (?). 

Nice creamy texture, dark and sweet on the front palate.  Cocoa and brown sugar.  Vanilla bomb all over all the sudden, gives way to some spice.  Legs get me back to the chocolate and some rye like flavors again.  These legs last for miles.  Realllly dries the mouth out.

I enjoyed this quite a bit.  OKI is the only other MGP 10 year I have had.  This has a ton more complexity than what I remember from the OKI but not quite the sweet dessert that made OKI so remember.  

If this opens up in a few weeks it has amazing potential."
