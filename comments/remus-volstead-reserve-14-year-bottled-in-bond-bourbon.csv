4.0,"Nose: neat: anise, caramel, vanilla, rye bread. As it opens some the licorice notes seem to dominate. Even later fresh citrus. With water: more caramel and malt takes the wheel on the nose. Orange citrus notes emerge late. 

Body: neat: medium

Palate: neat: licorice, vanilla, toffee, caramel. With water: interestingly I think the water brought out a peppery component I was surprised to see. 

Finish: medium with sweetness lingering, honey and hints of fresh cut grass. The only issue here is that it’s too short, I just want the flavor to last. 

Note: this is very nice neat. Amazing no. Very good yes. The licorice and sweetness are interesting. This is a very good dram. Layers of flavor are nice and interesting. Well put together and very smooth. Very enjoyable."

4.0,"Wasn't a fan, too floral for me"
4.5,"Color - warm mahogany with copper highlights. A quick swirl produces numerous legs streaking down the side of the glencairn.

Nose - brown sugar, red apples, oak, leather, cinnamon, orange peel and honeysuckle.  No real ethanol or heat, maybe a very faint whiff of dried varnish.

Palate - oily mouthfeel coats the tongue with notes of buttered toffee, caramel apples, cinnamon and vanilla; also a faint nutty note - but not the Beam/HH peanut - hazelnut maybe? Finish transitions to honey, oak and baking spices, without getting dry or tannic. 

Tried a few drops of water for the last half, didn't seem to change much aside from giving the mid-palate flavors a small boost.

All in all a really enjoyable dram. It's more complex and subtle than any other MGP bourbon I've tried. At 14 years I expected more of an oak-bomb, but this is not remotely over-oaked IMHO. Definitely one to savor when your palate is in top shape. My only real criticism is the finish doesn't linger as long as I'd like, nor does it really hit the back palate the way really great higher-proof whiskeys do."
