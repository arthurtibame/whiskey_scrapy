4.0,Very good indeed. Corn flavor is dominant and you get good kick from the spirit. I will buy it again.

4.5,Spicy and unique.  Great depth from the blue corn.
3.5,"Nose
Extremely sweet, syrupy, almost like vanilla extract. Slightly maple and caramel notes. After tasting the first time and smelling again, I'm getting butterscotch pudding.

Taste
Soft on the tongue, sharp down the throat. Tastes like watered down vanilla extract. Maybe a little butterscotch.
Second taste really burned the throat. Lots of butterscotch now."

4.0,"Nose:
Caramel. All of the caramel. Brown sugar, vanilla, contentment.
More vanilla than caramel after a short break. So much vanilla.
Taste:
Larger bite than expected. Throat still burns after swallowing. Strong vanilla taste. Slightly dusty, probably from corn"
2.0,"Texas resident so I hate to do this but I’m not a fan and have to rate accordingly. To me, there is too much maple syrup and chocolate liquor taste to be enjoyable. Smooth whiskey but too much of those flavors for me to enjoy. 

I use the rating scale below. Distiller uses a scale of 5 and I use a scale of 10, but I’m sure you’re not too drunk to do the math! 

1. Disgusting - So bad I poured it out.
2. Poor - I wouldn't consume by choice.
3. Bad - Multiple flaws.
4. Below average - Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.
5. Good - Just average.
6. Very Good - Better than average.
7. Great - Well above average.
8. Excellent - In a league of its own.
9. Incredible - An all-time favorite.
10. Perfect"

4.0,"Finally got around to trying the 100 proof. So far Balcones didn't disappoint me, and this is no exeption. On the nose there is a lot of burnt brown sugar with some vanilla, a dash of spices and candied pineapple. The fruit notes are more intense than they are on the cask strength, but all in all I like the other one better. Taste gives you a load of caramel and toasted brown sugars, decent amount of spice and vanilla with some dark chocolate notes later on, rounded with some pepper. It all ends with a sweet and slightly spicy aftertaste that stays for a medium length of time. All in all, this is a very good corn whisky, but the cask strength is better in my opinion. Now, the price difference between those two is about 25€ (90€ vs 115€), and considering both are horrendously overpriced outside of the states, if you are going to lay down the cash for it, might as well go with the cask strength. Because then you have a great whisky, and also the ability to add a bit of water to get this one here too. Can't go really wrong with either. Cheers."

5.0,"Slight citrus and sweet red fruit on the nose, caramel sweetness with a bit of chocolate and cinnamon taste, not overly sweet or cloying, with a smooth, almost oily mouthfeel"
5.0,"Perfect balance of flavors. A few drops of water, personally, make it perfection. But, neat is also delicious"
3.75,Sweetness on front end and nice bit on the backend
3.0,A significant bite but good flavor
5.0,Amazingly smooth. Not too much spice and a bit of sweet vanilla and almond on the palate.
3.25,"Standard bourbon profile. Oak and caramel are prevalent. Nice bite from the 100 proof. Clings to the tongue pretty well. Great on the nose, good clean ethanol and caramel. Good drinking, for sure."

3.5,definite flavor improvement over baby blue.
3.0,"Just when I had just about written Balcones off 3rd time lucky...not to shabby at all. Sweet, slight cough syrup/cola but not offensive and in fact it blends with the rest of the whisky - oak, caramel etc - quite nicely. Very smooth for 50%. Now I couldn't drink to much of this but 3.5 I'll give rounding down to a 3 when the nearly $90USD price (in UK) or  $140USD price here in NZ is taken into account."

4.0,"A more refined version of baby blue. With the baby blue you get vanilla corn. This one has more fruitiness, char, and spice. I get berries with some sweet corn and smokiness on the palate."
3.5,Aroma of fresh baked chocolate.  Tastes like the whisky equivalent of dark chocolate brownies.  Lurking in the background is a hint of pipe tobacco.  An excellent after-dinner whisky.

3.5,"Unique. Warmed up with Evan Williams BiB, and this takes a 90 degree turn from there. Nice nose of roasted sweet corn, and profound vanilla cake frosting. Mouthfeel is rich and evenly balanced. Hits with sweet corn and chocolate that gives way to a bit of grainy heat, fading quickly to a long warm finish of light ginger spice and smoke. Drinks a bit young, but overall an enjoyable and unique pour."
3.25,Smells and tastes of vanilla with ice
