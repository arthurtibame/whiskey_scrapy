3.0,"Nose: The nose is fresh and grassy with notes of lemon citrus, vanilla, freshly-mown hay, brown sugar, and a little oak. There's the faintest maritime touch, and interestingly the dry-glass aroma is of distant fragrant smoke.
    
Palate: A sweet and light arrival featuring apple and citrus. As it develops, a tannic note appears along with some spicy heat. There's a little licorice, barley sugar and some oak. The tannin builds and has a dryness like a dry sherry.
    
Finish: Medium/Short, peppery spice turning slightly sweet at the end.
    
In summary I'd call this a young and firm malt. It has a certain dry grip to the nose and palate that is almost bracing. It benefits greatly from the addition of just a little water, which tames the brightness of the nose and allows the more subtle notes to emerge. On the palate the addition of water creates a much more creamy mouthfeel, which is very agreeable. 
    
Like all Teaninich it brings to mind Johnnie Walker blends, particularly Red Label, this being one of their core malts.
    
I tasted this recently in a flight with Compass Box Asyla, and it's interesting to compare the two. Asyla is a light and subtle whisky that uses Teaninich as a core component to add the particular aromas and flavours that I've described above. When tasted in comparison, this malt seems both brighter and more direct but lacks complexity.
    
Not long ago I rated Teaninich 10 year Flora & Fauna - this is a slightly more intense and interesting version of the same distillate, but I wouldn't recommend it and it's not particularly good value.
