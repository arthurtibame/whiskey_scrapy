4.5,Ah yet another great drop. This one beautifully blends smokey charcoal and olorosso sherry flavour with a perfectly balanced oilyness. Good value at $75 USD here. Definitely another mid 4's. 4.49 to be precise.

null,"The last drop I had was the 2003 bottling with 12000 made. This is the 2004 bottling 1 of 9000. I did something I rarely do these days and bought a bottle without having sampled off the back of the previous years edition. So was it worth it? Beautiful olorosso jammy toffee, burnt caramel are all pluses. I can't remember when or if I've had such a strong sulphur taint though...man struck matches galore on the palate and gun powder on the nose. Reminds me of a gunpowder rum I once had (with actual gunpowder in). This year's bottling was 3000 less and I'm wondering if it was due to sulphur taint but they still mixed in a few affected barrels. My tongue really has a sulphur tingle which builds the more I drink. I think I hold off on rating for now. The whisky itself is at least a 4 maybe 4.25 but the taint drags it down a fair bit. I'll wait to see how the bottle evolves with oxygen. Update: It didn't and so I did something I never have done before or since - return it!"

4.0,Delicious and a lot going on. Peat and sweet and smooth. Complex and somewhat unexpected. A little honey and a nice finish. Seems a bit more mature than a 13 would be. I just started the bottle and I’m looking forward to having some more.

Natural color

Nose: complex; Stawberry/Raspberry/Green Apple; a faint and pleasant “mustiness;” orange cremcicle; slight vanilla; baked almond; slight raisin.

Palate: sweetness from berries; spices, like coriander and a hint of mint, black pepper; tobacco; powdered sugar; drying development; medium viscosity. So much happening here.

Finish: medium-long and warming; slight sourness like grapefruit, but balanced well with a sort of creaminess; hint of like charcoal smoke?; along slight cinnamon and nutmeg and the green apple returns.

Value: Price ranges from $110-140 USD. Worth it.

Final thoughts: A funky, complex dram of superior quality that could only come from Campeltown (and Springbank). This single malt is challenging, nuanced and rewarding, and is a must have for seasoned scotch drinkers with a soft spot for sherry.

4.5/5

Highly recommend buying a bottle"
4.75,"Hell yeah!

Put this in a Glencairn in your left hand and a Springbank 15 in your right hand...

Bonus points if you light a Cuban to go with them.

Thank me later"

4.5,"This is how I like my sherry cask whiskies: caramelized peanuts on the nose, with a hit of burnt match and a slightly funky background note. It’s oily in the mouth and surprisingly bold for the ABV. There’s a big hit of tangy sweetness upfront and then a slow fade to a peppery spice. It finishes slightly sweet and tangy, with a long oily aftertaste of dusky brown sugar. Great mouthfeel and a cask that hasn’t completely overwhelmed the spirit makes this an outstanding whisky."

5.0,"Strawberry jam with Sherry and a strong mushroom funkiness background. Super viscous and full bodied for a triple distilled malt. I know it’s unpeated but I can swear that’s a light peat somewhere to be found. 

This is so good on so many levels. 

And finally I join to the Springbank cult! 😄 
(Had Springbank 10 and Longrow 10 before and it was just ok)"
