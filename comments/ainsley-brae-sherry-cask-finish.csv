2.0,"Nose: Sweet candied orange. Palate: Orange and honey. Sweet. Short finish. Light spices. Not complex -- Lots of sherry sweetness, but little underneath that. This whisky is dominated by how the expression was finished (sherry cask). Summary: Very drinkable, but otherwise unremarkable. Not worth repeating even at this low price point."
3.75,"Very nice finish. Clean, sweet with a unique taste. good buy for the price"

4.0,I dont believe you can find a better scotch at the price sold at Total Wines $25.  I'd stack this bottle against many costing upwards of $80
