4.0,A little less sweet. A little bit harder. A little more character. And better than the classic No. 7.

4.5,"A really sweet and mellowed Jack Daniel's, the higher strength on this baby really brought up some flavors!

Bottled at 50% abv

On the nose it is great! Caramel in a fantastic way, Prunes like never before, Grassy, a lot of Burnt wood, Cola coca without gas, Maple syrup and Bananas.

On the palate, it is a very interesting dram. Its like you typical Jack Daniel's but on steroids. Spicy chilli, old Caramel, Creme brulee and a Bitter-sour bite.

Aftertaste has a very long finish with clove notes. 

Overall this dram is the best Jack Daniel's i have had so far and i grant it a solid 92 over 100. Cheers!"
3.75,Very good. Loved the vanilla notes

4.0,Sweet honey smel. No wood. No sweet to the taste. More scotch but does have rye. Very slight smoke. Much better than regular Jack
4.5,"I have been recently impressed with some of the limited expressions and Barrel Proof expression from Jack and it's really changed my opinion of this Distillery. 
In the past, seeing this one with the high price tag, it would have been an instant pass for me, however, today I decided why not. I was not dissapionted.
As soon as it hits your pallette you know instantly this is a huge upgrade on the standard Jack single Barrel. Soft vanilla, toffee and a rich, creamy mouthfeel. It's so silky. Then you start to get a lovely old leather note with toasted oak and some must. Finish is long with a lovely tart cherry note to compliment the lingering oak. 
It's really a wonderful effort from Jack Daniels that warrants it's price tag. 
Based on these notes, it's obvious this one has a lot of age to it. Getting leather and oak notes that quickly in the profile tells me this one has some juice north of 12 years old.
Great way to kick this long weekend off! Cheers my friends!"

4.0,"I’m not a huge Jack fan. However, this is a nice kick of a whiskey. The extra alcohol content is noticeable, but sometimes I like to drink something that makes certain I stay awake. Not something to sip if you are in a mellow mood. Reminds me of the “wake-up juice” Doc Brown drinks in Back to the Future 3... Great Scott!"

3.0,Hard to believe this guy is 80% corn.  It’s got a lingering finish but it’s a little harsh. Don’t think I’m a fan. 82/100
