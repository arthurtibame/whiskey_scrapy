2.0,"Citrus and honey with some briny quality on the nose.  Cereal and sweetness arrive as it opens.  Creamy and full on the palate.  Slight honey sweetness fades quick. Mild tongue burn on the tip and sides.  Black pepper-spicy, bitter finish.  With water/ice the sweetness is more pronounced and the spicy finish is weakened. Definitely a dram to serve over ice.  Not complex. Better than I expected."

3.0,"Actually have no complaints.  Very light and simple.  Fresh.  Very easy to sip, and would be a great introduction without scaring someone off.  I won't reach for it often, but wouldn't be afraid of it either if that's what they had at the pub."

2.0,"Cutty Sark, a no age ststement blended scotch whisky from The Erdington Group. Price $20.00, Sampled 1/13/16 with 1 teaspoon of water in a Glencairn spirits nosing glass.

Aroma - Soured grain, corn, rough ethanol, movie butter, yellow cake and lime leaf.

Taste - Light peach and apricot, malt, cereal, very thin and easy to down.

Finishes very quickly overall. 

Final score : 2 / 5, for a 20 dollar bottle of scotch this is....ok... you could do slightly better for 20, but not a whole lot worse at the same time. This whisky is good for drinking long or as a mixer, but isn't worth slow sipping. For the price you'd might as get grab yourself a bottle of Speyburn 10 and have an infinitely better experience. Glad to have tried, don't feel too bad for the price I paid but, will not be buying another bottle."

3.0,Don't bother looking for recognizable flavors of The Macallan or Highland Park in this blend (two of the component single malts) because you won't find them.  What you will find is a nice interplay between vanilla and citrus on the nose and palate.  The finish is a little bitter but that's to be expected from a budget blend.  Cutty Sark's lightness makes it ideal for mixing and it works good over ice on a hot day.

3.0,"While nothing special, for the price it is a pleasant enough whiskey to drink. I find that the fruit quality is enhanced with a slight chill, but it is already a light whiskey. So, drink with a few chilled whiskey stones and it is pretty enjoyable, especially for the low price."

2.0,"Floral with some cereal notes coming through under the nose. Light bodied, with some malt and faint notes of citrus  on the palate, but otherwise devoid of much flavour. The finish is short and slightly oaky. There is certainly not much to brag about here, but for $25 CAD a bottle, there is also not much to complain about either."

2.0,"Whisky number 3 from my recent purchase of 12 affordable blends. This is the first time I've ever tasted Cutty Sark.

Nose:  Fruity sweet with some cereal and honey notes. It's light and fresh but there is a fullness to it as well - it's certainly not a dry spirit. I'd risk a guess that the oak used for this still had a spark of life left as it's not overly bitter or tannic, at least in comparison to some blends at this price point.

Palate: Also lightly sweet but not as fruity as the nose - more like barley sugar with a creamy cereal quality and a slight oilyness. It's a nice mouthfeel, particularly for a lower-priced blend. There's a nutty hint and even a little caramel, but it's not heavy.

Finish: Cereal flavours and a slight sweet hot spice, but it is very short.

On the whole it's pleasant and compared with other blends in the price range is reasonable value. It is a good mixer with dilution bringing out even more sweetness and even the faintest smoky flavour. It makes a very nice highball but is easily overpowered by cola or dry ginger.

The profile reminded me a little of Ballantine's Finest but Cutty Sark has a sweeter finish, particularly when diluted, and a bit less body. The dry glass has an unusual floral-charcoal aroma, but it is very light.

""Acceptable"" : 2 stars."

4.0,"Cutty Sark has a very pale , champagne appearance, with strong alcohol legs, however. The aroma is of a quite low profile earthy, smoky peat. Taste is similarly mellow. Some might call it bland, but I think it must take extreme skill to blend these light ones, without presenting any off or off-kilter notes. Mouthfeel is light, and finish is relatively quick. RJT"

Nose: mildew, orange rind, vanilla.
Palate: watery, citrus.
Finish: medium length, a little spicy.
Water greatly improves the nose by removing the stink of the mildew, but dulls the palate considerably.
Overall: it tastes better than it smells, not entirely unpleasant, but fairly bland."

1.0,This shouldn’t exist. Tastes like watered scotch
2.5,"Appearance: A light straw color is the hue in this high selling blended scotch. Very thin, semi-viscous legs slide down the inside of the glass after a swirl.

Nose: On the nose I find notes of grain, dusty corn, a small touch of peat, some ashy smoke, salted caramel candy, and a light lemon flourish. 

Taste: The palate I find, as their website suggests, not harsh at all. There are notes of honey, some light peat again, lemon or clementine citrus, and red grape. Simple and inoffensive.

Finish: The short finish leaves a lemony note that has rung true through the majority of the experience. 

Thoughts: This blended scotch was a decent dram: affordable, decent tasting, and has a cool history. It’s not a hero whiskey one needs to explore very hard; on the Cutty Sark website they even suggest its best utilized when mixed. I’ll probably not buy it again, but won’t turn anyone away from trying it if they haven’t already. Thanks Cutty Sark! I’m curious to try your Prohibition Edition. Sláinte!"

2.75,"Light flavour, medium to high body, grain alcohol, lightly dry finish"
3.5,"Simple and soft, it is not a bad dram at all. Just simple.

Bottled at 40%abv, with a pale staw color.

On the nose is very dim, with notes of stinky peat, tobacco, pepper, salt, sea aroma, vanilla and chocolate lindt.

On the palate is normal but fine, with caramel, liquorice, pepper, tobacco, and the finish is sweet & salty, with a mild hotness, and chocolate lindt.

Overall this one is a 75 over 100."
2.0,"After hearing good things about this blend I decided to give it a try. It’s a cheap blend from Edrington Group (even though they sold it recently I think this bottle is still from that era), but so is Famous Grouse and I really enjoyed that one, so why not drop the $20 and give it a go?  Bottled at 40% ABV and chill filtered, but is a natural color of pale straw. 

The nose is intensely sweet up front. It’s almost completely dominated by ripe green pears, very sugary sweet. Also some white grape/peach juice and a very light coconut and pineapple. A floral note, perhaps apple blossoms. Salty, slightly biscuity with a very light lemon and honey. Ashy and wood smoke, but not your typical peaty profile. 

The palate is intense for 40%, but most of that is a young peppery grain harshness. More of those ripe pears...piles of them. Peach, apricot, salty and sour. Not much after that. 

Light to medium bodied, thin but creamy, mouthwatering. 
The finish is short with grain alcohol, pears and salt. 

I have to admit, I had a hard time trying to pull nosing notes out of this one. The pears were so dominant for me that I missed a lot. I had to check other reviews to get my bearings. The palate was a little more straightforward. Either way, this is not a whisky for sipping neat. It does, however, get masked by cola very well. I mixed Pepsi with this (about 3:1 pop to whisky) and there was hardly any alcoholic presence. For the money, which is forgivably low, I’d rather buy a bottle of Famous Grouse. At least with that you get a hint of Macallan and Highland Park. Will not buy again unless it’s to be specifically used as a mixer. 
Cheers"

Neat: Saltwater taffy, brine that is somehow reminiscent of soy sauce. Metallic astringency. Some definite buttered popcorn business happening. 

With a droplet: the salt remains, but the peat becomes more mossy and boggy. The toffee and sugary malts bloom. The burn wafts away."
