5.0,"Of the 3 varieties of Gretzky Whisky, Ice Cask offers the most unique flavor profile, along with having the most bourbon character due to its higher corn content. I find it is best enjoyed neat. As of July 2017, it is only available at the Gretzky Winery & Distillery in Niagara-On-The-Lake ($60 CAD), which is a shame as it is considerably superior to the Red Cask, widely sold through retail liquor stores. It is also more distinct and a much better value than the premium ""99 Proof"" offering ($99 CAD), which is highly similar to Canadian Club 12-year / Small Batch."

4.0,"This whisky is rich with Rye spice and corn sweetness. The nose is a little floral, and has red fruits throughout. The palate is a good balance of butterscotch on the core, with rye spice on the edges. The fruit does not develop as much as I expected, but there is a slight bitterness which may come from the wine tannins. The finish has legs, and bring out the wood and spice. While it was coating up front, it finished drier than I would have expected. Clearly better than the Red casks. (3.5 Stars)"

4.0,"More depth then red cask, and more spice. Nice long finish. Less smoke than red cask. Very good."
3.0,a bit sweeter but also more burn than the red cask. didn't think I would like this one but it was surprisingly more complex with stronger vanilla.

2.75,"No. This is not a joke. This is Wayne Gretzky's whisky. Nobody knows what ice casks means nor is important. A canadian whisky, made by ""Wayne Gretzky's estates"". 

For you who dont know who Wayne Gretzky is, he is the Pelé or Maradona of ice Hockey.

On the nose, RYE. Lots of it. Rye spiciness, grain, herbal notes and molasses. Its like rum and rye whisky mixed together. After the first sip, maple syrup notes appeared on the nose. 

On the palate, very straightforward: rye spiciness and bitter prunes. Aftertaste is full of chilli. 

Overall this is something i wouldn't buy, but an interesting whisky to come by, to know what sports stars are up to these days. 58 over 100."
3.5,"This special Canadian boasts a polished bronze color, and thicker semi-viscous legs ease their way back down the glass.

The nose is soft and pretty. It almost has an effervescent smell like champagne or sparkling flavored water. There are also notes of raspberries, mowed grass, and baking spices.

The palate has a watery mouthfeel and is overall sweet. There are delicious notes of white wine, maple, honey, orange citrus, and rye spice.

The finish is medium in length with a fresh almost minty gum taste sending you off.

The whisky is simple but so good! It’s a sweet, delicious dram. And if I ever come across it at a decent price I’ll get it again. Gretzky Estates, Thanks! Cheers!"

4.0,The color is a vibrant gold with legs that slowly work their way down the glass. The nose is a perfect balance of earthy rye spiciness and ice wine sweetness alongside corn and cereal sweetness. The palate is somewhat oily and full of oak and ice wine with an earthy rye spiciness alongside it. The finish is medium with the sweetness lingering while the earthiness fades. Very simple but excellent.
