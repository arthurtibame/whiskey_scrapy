5.0,"There’s a few times in life you would have an opportunity to watch a grown man cry.  One such opportunity would be when an otherwise relatively intelligent man does a dumbass idiotic move like trying to carry a bottle of expensive single cask fully sherry matured Japanese whiskey to his car, just so he can take it to his storage unit, as it just so happens his wife will kick him out if she sees another whiskey bottle at home.  It’s relatively benign carrying a bottle to your car’s trunk.  Except when it’s a snowing outside and your drive way is iced and slippery.  All I can say is, out of the 1/2 ounce or so that I managed to save from the broken bottle, this is an ABSOLUTE stunner of a whiskey.  A single cask sherry Chichubu, made for a Parisian wine company.  Single cask Chichibu are now rare as hen’s teeth and prices range well upwards of $700+.  As I lay there in the snow, holding a broken bottle, I figured now is a good time as any to maybe taste this.  An involuntary pour.  Can’t say much about the nose, since I was sitting there in shock for a good hour and my nose froze in the cold, but the taste is amazing.  Thick viscous and meaty.  Cherries and plum.  Closest I can think of is a Yamazaki 18, but far better.  Anise, allspice and some cardamom.  There’s a lesson in this kids:  drink your good stuff now, because let’s face it...your brain cells are dying as you get older and you’re most likely going to fall on ice while carrying that expensive whiskey."
