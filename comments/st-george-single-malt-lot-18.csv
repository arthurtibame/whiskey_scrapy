2.0,"Really? The distillers sampled this and thought “yep it’s ready”?

The aroma is malty with honey. Not bad at all. Then the sip is completely out of the blue with a slightly sour bitter beer flavor. Yeah, beer. And a finish of beer. Yes beer. I don’t dislike beer, it’s just that I usually drink beer for the beer flavor and whisky for, well not beer flavor. I’ll return to this ‘single malt’ later and see if I can get behind what St George is up to. BEER?! Weird man, weird."
4.0,"vanilla and butterscotch on the nose; oak, smoke, leather in the mouth--no peat, and not sweet; dry dry cocoa finish. aftertaste left my tongue tingling, like the nettles in St George absinthe--unusual feeling. interesting Irish style whisky. we'll see how the narrow flavor range grows on me. very different from no.17, my only other St George whisky reference (and a better whisky)."

4.0,"Just picked up my 2018 bottle. Initial impressions are this is my least favorite that I’ve had (14-18, 30th, 35th), but I’m hoping it just needs more time to breathe."
