3.0,One of my favorite everyday bourbons. I enjoy the single barrel much more but the small batch is great and it's right down the road.  Soft and sweet. A little bitterness on the finish but that seems to vanish with the John J. Bowman. The reviewer is incorrect however as this is not a wheated mashbill. It's actually mashbill #2 from Buffalo Trace.

5.0,"How the crap does this only have an 82 score on here? This is a VERY good, complex, sweet bourbon. You can definitely tell it's sourced from Buffalo Trace, as the similarities with Blanton's are very obvious.
Nose on this is exceptional, wonderful vanilla and toffee flavors. Initial palate is soft and flavorful, with typical vanilla, caramel, and toffee notes undernoted by a pleasant taste of cherries and blueberries. Midpalate sees the berry taste continue and expand. Finish is sweet with hints of oak. 5 stars, easily."

4.0,"Vanilla aroma with a sweet tobacco scent. The alcohol in the nose is assertive, but that's to be expected with a triple distilled, Kentucky inspired spirit. Peppery palette with a smooth, stone fruit linger that barely burns my lips.  It makes me think of someone taking a generous swig while manning a rickety covered wagon.  I'd recommend drinking this while pleasantly isolated after a long workweek. 4 stars."

4.0,"This small batch bourbon goes under the category of a great bottle at a great price.    You definitely pick up leather, and vanilla on the nose.   Spices hit you first on your palate, with the hint of mixed fruit.  The finish is easy and short living."

2.75,"Good looking bottle and labeling with heavy wooden stopper. Great nose, heavy with dried apricot, vanilla and old leather. Neat it enters butterscotch sweet with hints of dried fruit. Cinnamon with a peppery kick to the finish. Sounds great, right? Then the odd aftertaste hits. Hard to describe, but very unpleasant. This taste then hangs around long enough to ruin the next sip, and the next, and the next... Water or ice helps some, but the finish is just ""off"". I really wanted to like this one, and have tried letting it sit to open up. Tried water and/or ice, but it's just not getting there for me."

3.0,"Thin silky texture, ample sweetness, the usual fare for bourbon with a savory finish. Slightly better than most meat and potatoes. Yet another worthwhile bourbon at the magical $30 mark."
4.0,"Saw this bottle on the shelf, a neat looking bottle where you can see the brothers pictures behind the front label looking through the bourbon. Once I looked it up on the Distiller app and saw it was Buffalo Trace juice distilled a third time I wanted to try it. The color was a nice medium amber. The nose had sweet apple and some cinnamon. Taste was slightly buttery then some spice which was not overwhelming. Finish was smooth with a medium linger.  With all the BTAC expressions hard to get this is a nice alternative at an affordable price I found under $35 in northern KY."
