4.0,"On the nose it's honey, toffee, and the briny sea. On the palate is white pepper, peat, fruit, and smoke. It's oily and finishes with a good warmth. NCF, NAS, a blend of four single malts from Arran, Jura, Islay and Orkney. This is not a monster from Islay but there's still enough smoke and peat to overwhelm a beginner."
4.0,North Shore Whisky Club: very drinkable island. Light on the peat and salt but very pleasant. Would buy if price is right.

3.5,"Imagine an old wooden fishing boat, crusted shells and wet seaweed drying on a rocky coastline, and you get a fairly good impression of this Island Blended Malt. The nose of 'Rock Oyster' is maritime, briny and moderately peaty with hints of citrus fruits and honey. If only the taste would be on par with the aroma! Arriving fresh, zesty and peppery sweet, there is no apparent oak influence and the dry peatiness is rather bland. The quickly fading finish is spicy and mildly bitter. Although a bit pricey and young, this malt is nicely composed and well worth a try.

RATING: 3.5/5.0 stars ≙ 83 pts → ABOVE AVERAGE"

4.0,"If you're a fan of Island whiskies, this is the blend for you. The nose is assertively salty and briny, with sweet vanilla and an undercurrent of smoke. The palate delivers the promises made on the nose - this is full of coastal brine, with moderate peat, vanilla sweetness, and a dry, almost bitter, herbal finish. It's an enjoyable dram, though I'm not sure I'd take it over some similarly priced single malts in the Island/Islay categories. That said, I'm also not going to say no to a dram of it, either..."

Good stuff."

4.25,"On the nose, sweet fruits with smoke and sea salt in the very beginning, then it transitions to syrup/honey type of sweetness and maltiness, while the sea breeze is always present.
The palate is sweet and slightly creamy then quickly evolves to peppery spice, ashy, smoky, later becomes malty and even a bit nutty.
It finishes long and peppery, at the very end becoming dry, nutty with a black tea-like sweet aftertaste.
Right at the beginning it definitely gives me memories of Bowmore, which imo is responsible for the peaty smoke in this dram. Overall a wonderful one!
p.s. the empty glass is truly ""rock oyster"" on ""damp ash"""
4.5,"Fourth stop in Douglas Laing's core expressions, Rock Oyster, a ""pearl inside a bottle""; an Island Blended Malt, made with spirits from orkney, jura, arran and Skye. Bottled at 46.8%abv.... and it is great.

On the nose, is like having a Jura prophecy with a lemon touch. Clove. Douglas laing typical cake notes coming after a couple of minutes.

On the palate Lime with salt and pepper. Rock salt. Island pepper. The typical orange note from island whiskies. Finish is medium, mouth numbing.

Overall it is a faithfull reflection of island whiskies. Is a blended malt that feels a lot like any island single malt whisky. 92 over a 100, recommended. Slainte!"

4.0,"Bottled 2017.  

This is technically discontinued.  The geniuses from marketing decided “Rock Oyster” is an unpalatable name for a whisky.  Henceforth Rock Island.

Shame.  Rock Oyster was the perfect name for this whisky.  I get rocks – a lovely minerality; an epiphany of brine and barnacles.  I get oysters – sweet pacific oysters, a paradoxical enigma of creamy zinc metal.  I also get a lot of maltiness and a clean smoke – not the black coal plant fumes that power Ardbeg; but the white nuclear plant steam that powers, perhaps, Arran?

This is a young whisky.  Most of this blend is probably somewhere in the 3-6 year range.  This is memorable for how much damp sawdust, metal, and banana flavors that generally make me skeptical of young whiskies, but it works very well in Rock Oyster.  Probably, there is a touch of older whisky for balance.  Even more probably, I have fallen for the packaging, the theme, and the spine to name a whisky “Rock Oyster.”

The only problem I have with this whisky is that I don’t feel like it all the time.  When I am in the mood for something rich and indulgent, this is anathema.  But when I am in the mood for something barren and battered to match the mood after the holidays, nothing quite satisfies like this pearl.

Score: * (unforgettably good)

4.5,"Nose: Immediate sea salt and smoke, briny marine notes with seaweed, light peat from coastal wood and moss with hints of cheesiness. some black pepper is complimented by green fruit sweetness, green grapes and slight tropical fruit, almost pine apple.

Palate: Much heavier smoke, rich and oily, grape and green apple come through with spices, cinnamon perhaps. Herbal on the back of the tongue, rosemary and sweet vanilla. Buttery biscuit lingers with cheesy and kipper notes.

Finish: Short to medium in length, very rich, slight oak, very sweet with ever-lingering smoke and herbal notes, mossiness"

4.0,"Appearance: The color is clearly pure, with no added coloring as it is so light nearly to the point of water. Imagine liquified white corn, or you put a tea bag of white tea in hot water for a second realizing it’s not the flavor you wanted so you pull it out quick. I imagine that would give it the same hue. The legs are thin and semi viscous as they work their way back down the glass.

Nose: The nose starts off sugary cotton candy sweet and flawlessly transitions into a smoky note. Behind that, notes of peat, moss, wet leaves and ash, and honey round out the remainder of the bouquet. I really like this nose! I added a splash of water and did the nose no favors unfortunately. It made it very weak and flowery.

Taste: The body is really nice and oily. The palate consists of a sea saltiness, which then shifts and translates in my head as a soy sauce note. From that, I would wager this would be a fun whisky to have with sushi! After that the peat notes come in, as well as herbs and crispy baked green vegetables. By adding a splash of water I made it even more salty but clingy too. Again, no favors.

Finish: The finish is long warm and lingering. I really enjoy how it lasts; it personally makes me both want to drink some more, yet also not, and be content and enjoy the aftertaste a while. I’d say it’s a good conflict.

Thoughts: Dang! I really liked this scotch! This is a blended malt that really impressed me! I would definitely recommend this scotch and would happily buy it again! I really like the thought that went into this blend and into the other regional blends in the family too, which I am now very excited to try! Douglas Laing & Co., many thank yous, and keep doing great work! Sláinte!"
3.25,Decent blend that has a sweetly peat nose courtesy of Laphroaig and a smooth and salty body from Jura and Scapa.
