2.0,Weird fruit flavor straight
4.25,How good is it?  My wife doesn’t like whisky or hard liquor.  But she likes this quite a bit.  Try it with Martinellis cranberry-apple and ice.

3.0,"Sweet whiskey, but not too sweet. True to form flavors of the Oregon Marionberry with just enough whiskey backbone to keep away from the liqueur classification. A solid mixer and a great segue for those who are trying to transition from sweeter cocktails to the world of whiskey. Great with tart citrus, dry ginger beer, as a float on a sweet bourbon, or with just a couple of rocks in a glass.
(Pro Tip: Experiment with ice cream for a boozy dessert)"
3.0,"As someone who rarely dips their nose into the realm of flavored whiskeys, I can honestly say this is pretty enjoyable. Sweet and fruity, who'd of guessed, up front, with a bourbon vanilla on the finish. Just fine with some soda and lime."
