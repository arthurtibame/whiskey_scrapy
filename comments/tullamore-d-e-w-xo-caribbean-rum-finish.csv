4.0,"Getting back on the review-writing horse after a very busy January. Between the usual holiday craziness as a pastor, my daughter's first birthday, my wife's birthday, my mom's birthday, and my siblings-in-law coming to visit...well that's why we have whiskey, now isn't it? I was surprised to see this brand spankin' new bottling (at least new to the US...it debuted in the fall in Ireland)  already on the shelves in Madison. As a dram, it is an interesting corollary to Teeling Small Batch, which is also finished in rum barrels...and it showcases a bit of the difference between their house styles. Whereas Teeling comes across as lighter and more floral, with summery stone fruit, citrus, and  a nice overlay of rummy brown sugar, Tullamore has a richer quality - butterscotch pudding, mashed ripe banana, bruleed pineapple. The rum influence certainly reveals itself, but differently. I wish there were a bit more complexity to the dram, plus  the finish is a bit short and there's some young spirit jaggedness that the rum influence can't quite mask, but on the whole, this is an enjoyable Irish blend that's well suited for a casual dram in a comfy chair while watching The Good Place (your preferred tv pairing may vary)."

4.0,"I was actually out looking for a rum finished single malt scotch when I ran into this and since I am fond of all Irish Whiskys, I thought I'd give this a try. My interest was also piqued as Tullamore is now owned by William Grant. (can we say Balveinie Caribbean Cask single malt scotch?) Anyway, on the palate,  the sweetness factor is there for sure, but there is no mistaking this as an Irish Whisky, the softness and friendliness is there. Even at 43%. I'm getting tropical notes for sure. I want to say pineapple and mango, some brown sugar for sure. The sweetness is on the nose also, but again Irish for sure. Finish is short and sweet. I really enjoyed this neat. I would bet chilled this would be a winner also but I'm afraid any water would hurt it's delicate nature."

2.0,"I’ll preface this by stating I usually just stick to scotch.  Thanks to @Scott_E, I’ll be able to give this a try.  The nose reminds me of a grain, which I am not fond of, but I’ll give it a try.  There is a nice orange and vanilla with spice underneath some sawdust and woody elements. The palate is more of the same to me with some metallic notes on the finish. It dries out quickly. I get some tea, floral properties, subtle caramel, and toffee on the palate too, but there isn’t enough actual sweetness to balance out the other notes. This is just not in my wheelhouse at all, but I appreciate the experience.  1.75!"
4.0,Pleasant and smooth with fruity end notes
4.0,"I have it on the rocks right now. Not bad, but long and hot on the finish tonight. I’ll have to try it later and see if I change my thoughts"

3.0,"This Irish whiskey was sent as an extra pour from one of my friends included in our distillery sample group:  @Scott_E, from Long Island, NY.  This is the traditional Tullamore DEW that’s been finished in Caribbean Demerara rum casks.  It’s bottled at 43% and is a deep, gold color and makes very tiny beads and a few scarce legs.

The nose was particularly heavy on the grainy side, with banana and citrus peels playing through.  Heavy rum presence, as well.  The palate carries the rum theme while still retaining the typical, creamy Irish whiskey characteristics.  Some slight vanilla mingled in, alongside some butterscotch and weak orchard fruits.  The finish was medium length and very rich, especially for an Irish.  

Overall, I enjoyed this one probably way more than I should have, or it deserved.  I didn’t really sit down and analyze it and instead I just reveled in the change of pace from my normal scotch routine.  For that, I’m going to give it 3.5 stars.  I don’t think I’ll be seeking out a full bottle, but I did enjoy the break from the norm.  Cheers."

2.0,"Taking a short break from scotch to sample an Irish whiskey that was a bonus sample for this round of the SDT, courtesy of @Scott_E. Tullamore DEW is a blended Irish whiskey, this one is finished in Caribbean rum casks. Bottled at 43% ABV and is certainly chill filtered and it appears to have a good amount of colorant added making it an amber honey color. 

The nose starts off with a big whiff of grain alcohol and an alcohol nip. Once it settles a bit there is some creamy vanilla and coconut with fresh zippy oak. Light brown sugar and faint rum notes. Some sweetness from what I get as berries, but also some banana and orange rind. There is an off note that comes and goes and I can’t put my finger on it. With a little water definite notes of butterscotch and toffee come through and the harshness from the grains is tempered a bit. 

The palate is not good unfortunately. Sharp grainy alcohol. Bitter, metallic and quite unpleasant. With way more water than should be needed for a 43%er, things got a little better. Rum, butterscotch, banana, brown sugar and bitter oak. That metallic note persists though and a little pine shows up. Better, but still not good. 

A medium light bodied mouthfeel that is mouth coating and dry. 
The finish is medium long, metallic with notes of rum, butterscotch and is very dry. 

The nose isn’t half bad here, but the palate is more than half bad. The amount of water needed to make it palatable kills the nose to the point where you might as well be nosing tap water with a butterscotch candy slowly dissolving at the bottom of the glass. At $30 it’s not a huge blow to the wallet, but for the same price I’d rather grab a bottle of JW Red and mix it with some tonic. I’ll give a 2 and move on. 
Cheers"
2.0,"A bonus sample provided by my buddy @Scott_E as part of our little SDT trading team.  I had high hopes for this one...my only other Tullamore was a 14 yr old, which I loved.  It’s like that 2nd book of Lord of the Rings.  You guys and gals have read that?  There was a lot of nothing happening there in that 2nd book, despite tons of pages.  Trees just walking around.  Monologues just happening endlessly.  This is just like that.  It’s got a dense mouthfeel, but I’m not seeing the benefit of the rum cask.  It’s not bad...just a bit of a let down,  not much going on.  So...the key question:  would I buy a bottle?  No.  Would I buy a pour? No.  Would I refuse if offered?  No...would gladly try again to see if my opinion changes,  Thanks for this @Scott_E"

3.0,"In Hartford in business which means I must go to Vaughan’s and get myself a Guinness and Cod & Chips only to top it off with a small but respectable set of whiskies. 

Straw, pineapples, toffee, bananas and orange zest with a metallic overtone hovers as you take in the aromas. I noticed the same metallic note as with Teeling’s Small Batch. This may caused by the way the rum cask mixes with the unmalted barley (just an uneducated guess). 

The body is unexpectedly heavy for an Irish whiskey which are typically lightweight. This arrives  with a sugary palate. Brown sugar, creme brûlée, butterscotch are the first flavors to arrive. A bit of tropical pineapple and coconut slide in after the sweetness. From there, the spicy side kicks into gear. Spicy cinnamon and white pepper prickle the tongue. 

The tropical rum notes are detectable on the finish. Oak tannins dry the palate with a pinch of lemon zest and ginger. The flavors fade quick but the oak dryness lasts. 

This is a simple, sweet, fun whisky. Much akin to Teeling’s Small Batch but with more weight (and slightly cheaper). There is a definite youngness to the spirit which is kept somewhat in line with the sweet, rum finish. The extra few points in alcohol give it a good sense of gravity, uncommon in most Irish Whiskey’s that are typically bottles at 40%.  Find a pour and go have some fun with this Dew. [86/100][Tasted: 4/11/18]"

4.0,"Smell, at first, is hard to place. Sweet and fruity for sure.

After a few sips the smell becomes more prominent. Very strong banana and some vanilla.

In terms of taste, the banana is pretty forward. Hints of coconut and Carmel notes with some citrus on the end.

The finish is long, strong and rummy. I’m not a huge rum-guy, but I love the rum after taste this leaves.

If you’re looking for a different, fun whisky, this is a good choice."
