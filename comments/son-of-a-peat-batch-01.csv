4.0,peaty (surprise surprise) smokey and delicious
4.0,"Not nearly as peaty as Laphroaig or Ardbeg, but plenty enough to know its Islay. Campfire and salt on the nose, the palate is very smoky with a hint of sweetness. Finish is long and warm. Overall this was extremely tasty, had me nosing the glass and sipping little by little. Lots going on here, definitely a smell-taste-ponder-repeat dram."
