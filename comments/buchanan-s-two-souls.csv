3.5,"Buchanan's is normally a nice blended whisky, and now they have come up with a new experiment, finishing their normal whisky in casks that previously had Tequila Don Julio. So, how did the tequila finish influence the whisky? That is what i am about to tell you, but first let me say that i am not a fan of tequila. I am one of those people who had a bad tequila experience when i was 20, and since then, i am unable even to smell it. 

Bottled at 40%abv. 

On the nose: aroma is interesting. Sweet at first, with lots of influence from Don Julio's Tequila. Vanilla, Milk chocolate; Slight agave/tequila. Sugar cane. Very sweet and inviting. Straightforward but easy aroma. After first sip a dim orange note appears.

On the palate: Tequila. Salt. Very spicy. 
In a blind tasting event, you wouldn't guess it is a Buchanan's. It doesn't feel like whisky. It is more like a ""puro"" (raw liquor / moonshine).

Aftertaste is not something to remember. Is short and salty. That's it.

Overall this is my least favorite Buchanan's, i don't know if this review will be popular, but i want my whisky to feel as whisky and not tequila. For me, this is a failed experiment, eventhough the nose manage to score some points. 73 over 100."
