3.75,Sweet front and smell. At first tastes like young corn whiskey but is refined in the back. Smooth no burn. Clean finish that lingers the right amount of time. Thoroughly enjoy sipping

4.75,"Spectacular single malt. Chocolate, banana, and light citrus notes with a semi-sharp but pleasant bite. Packs a good punch. Great sipper."

4.0,lots of short bread - rasp at end - mid range hug - brown sugar - packed with flavor - corn sweetness but not overdone - bit of coffee - bit of chocolate - faint cherry on the lead - burnt sugar desert.  almost and maybe a hint of orange

4.25,"Sweet, spicy, deep, malty... best way to describe this is chewing tobacco marinated in Dr. Pepper!"
4.0,The lower this bottle gets the more complex the whiskey becomes – oxygen is its friend. Aroma is a complex ball of fruit with layers of oak and dark sweets; Palate mimics but with even deeper fruitiness and heavy slabs of dark sweets lead by brown sugar; Finish hits with a fruit bomb that echoes on and on.

3.5,This Single Malt whisky has a lot of depth and flavor once you get past the initial spice. The product sits at 128 proof so a certain pinch is expected but can take some tasters off guard. The finish levels out this whisky with expanding notes of Caramel and toffee.
5.0,It’s a must try. Unexpected flavor
4.25,Very flavorful Single Malt! The bottle is newly cracked so looking forward to how it opens up. At this point I have to say it has a stronger taste profile (yet different) than ECBP which is another of my top favs........S'lainte!
