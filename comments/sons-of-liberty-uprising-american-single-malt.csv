4.0,"complex but not muddled flavor profile with a strong infusion of yeasty/malty taste, presumably from the porter base, that appears  after the first lighter cereal taste and persists into a moderate finish.  Quite accessible.  Good introduction to American single malt."
2.0,Strong overpowering oak flavor
3.0,"Nose of licorice, brown sugar  and vanilla.   Palate: anise,  licorice,  burnt cinnamon,  some spice.  Finish, lingering and sugary with a lot of coffee.   Young and in need of mellowing (further aging)"
