  A little smokier than the younger bottling it's not enough to justify the significant difference in price.

That this site has rated is only $$ in terms of expense is suspicious."

Not as woodsy as people have said. Will try with water or ice to get different feel! Highly recommend if you can find it!!

4.0,If you have never been in a grain silo for corn just rub a drop of this between your hands and smell. The oak follows but is more mellow. Only 90 proof but has an alcohol bite. Nicely spicy with Orr of a nutmeg. Long and oily finish that lingers on the sides of my tongue with a bit of menthol and a bit medicinal. Overall good for this particular barrel.
2.0,Drank this on a session at Baxter inn Sydney. Didn't mind it at first and I like the barrel strength version but I found this one way too sweet. Long story short there's better out there. Didn't take long till I moved back to Macallan.

4.5,"Barreled on 11/24/97. Wow, the legs on this! The nose is similar to the EC 12 but more pronounced, definitely getting an oaky vanilla, brown sugar, and apples. A slight spice as well. A great smelling bourbon for sure. Feels thick on the tongue. Spicy from the get go, and the spice lasts throughout. Strong flavors of wood, caramel, apples, and bitter chocolate. It's sweet but balanced. The flavors don't seem to disappear, even long after the juice has been swallowed. This flavor profile makes this sound like a standard bourbon, but there's a certain unique aspect to this. It's memorable, yet very familiar. Unfortunately for my wallet I may need to find a backup bottle or two. 4/17/17 
Vanilla, buttery apple pie on the nose. Fresh. On the palate, rich, oaky, fruity. Very accessible yet layered. Decent finish. Fantastic. 7/21/17"

4.0,"Nose - Brown sugar simple, barrel aged vanilla, hint of sweet cherry vanilla coke.
Taste - Fairly thin but drying, oaky vanilla brown simple, oaky charred cinnamon spice, lightly oaky/char bitterness.
Finish - Dry oak, cinnamon spice, barrel aged simple.
Score - 82/100
Final Thoughts - As much as I wanted to like this one there didn't seem to be much going on. It had a very simple, but pleasant nose, but sadly I didn't get much of the cherry vanilla coke on the taste as I did on the nose. Oak was present but I don't think it was very overpowering like many people have stated, but maybe that's because I tend to like more bitter things. It's not a bad bourbon by any means, but there's not really anything that really distinguishes itself from others. If tasted blind, I don't think I'd be able to pick this one out as maybe this particular barrel wasn't the best? To me, it tasted like a slightly oakier ""generic"" bourbon."

5.0,"2017 release of EC18. The new bottle is an improved sleek design from previous years.  A seasonal release at $130 this bottle can be difficult to find.  Nose is wet cherry wood,  citrus fruits, vanillans. Light body and feel. Palate of citrus and dark fruit, dry bark and wet tobacco.  Finish is soft.  Over all and interesting great bourbon without a strong bite.  Another great EC product, I do prefer over the 23-yr as I feel any more age is too woody.  Keep drinking friends."

Along with a bottle of Midleton Very Rare Irish  '17 (I know---overpriced, but it's Heaven sent and I love it), I will buy a bottle of this every year and nurse it through. From a relative novice, this is simply a great example of fine whiskey making. The Distiller's review has it right: you can nose this stuff for hours and keep picking out the barrel splinters, it is that strong. And yet, after the strong oak, we get a soft bourbon feel in the mouth which now includes a nice minty/menthol without the nasal attributes. Amazingly for a Bourbon there is very little sweet to this. In fact all of the usual suspects like Vanilla, Caramel, etc. are actually quite indistinct and nicely blended into the gentle 90 proof heat. With a small amount of ice chips, the oak splinters disappear on nosing and the whiskey opens up with tasty Mint still in fashion along with a Vanilla creaminess. Classic American Whiskey making at it's best.

I've had some great EC18's so I went into this pretty excited. I'll go back to this after my notes but I did a blind tasting of this vs 2 knob creeks (the new 12 year, review coming, and a 9 year store pick). I'll save you the spoiler but it wasn't a good result.

Nose - I think the whisky shines here. There's a lot of oak, vanilla, it's dry, a bit spicy, but there's a funky oak note here. I'm not sure that'll go over with everyone.

Taste - The problem with the taste is that funk on the nose is all over the flavor. There's so much oak here and not a nice sweet fruity oak. Not a nice inviting one, but just funky dried up oak. Still, there's vanilla, caramel, light spice, a bit of sour dough perhaps. What's confusing me is that on past 18's have gotten so much fruit and all these nice flavors and here the oak is a bit over the top, but it's not the oak that's ruining this. It's the lack of other flavors. 

This is an uncorking and as such I'm super hopeful this will change in the bottle, but so far...this is not doing it for me. 

1.75 stars. I don't think most people will enjoy this bottle as it is. I however don't think this is bad whisky, it's got some stuff going on and I""m hopeful it opens up into a better but still disappointing bottle."
4.25,"A cereal grain nose at first that dissipated to a firm oak note. A nice blend of flavors between light caramel, a bit of spice, noticeable aged wood and a bit of heat for 90proof. Very smooth up front with a moderate finish."

4.0,"Nose- heavy oak, orange zest, burnt caramel, honey, plums, spiced vanilla

Palate- Heavy and bold oak (but not overpowering), caramel, spices, honey, mint, vanilla

Finish- Long, viscous finish with notes of heavy oak and slight vanilla

I’ll start off by saying this is a very balanced bourbon for being 18 years old, while this is good, it also makes this bourbon pretty simple. It primarily smells and taste of oak- but not in an overpowering way. Oak is present throughout, but other flavors flash in and out the longer it sits on my palate. Long finish but not as complex as I would like. There are better bourbons out there- especially for the money."

5.0,"“Whiskey 🥃 Grilling Time Review!”
Elijah Craig 18yr 🦄 

Official Website:
Distillery: Heaven Hill
Release Date:  Ongoing (Annual, typically 4th quarter)
ABV: 45%
Age: 18 Years
Mashbill: 78% Corn, 12% Malted Barley, 10% Rye
Price: $150 (2019)

Nose:
Zest citrus hits the nose, toasted oak, honeysuckle, vanilla bean, classic old school bourbon with life! Its sweetness is perfect with some hearty oak notes that balanced nose.

Front:
Like the nose it citrus butter sweet orange than a vanilla and oak start to coat the mouth, with brown sugar, caramel, and a fruit hits again. The oak remains, but there is a floral fruit side. 

Back/Finish:
Pairing with the cigar i still get a good charr oak and then pulls away during the finish and quickly I get many of the fruitier complexity floral flavors. It lingers slowly and I bet with this cigar goes for a good minute making is a slow & low sipper

My magical 🧙‍♂️ afternoon cheers WGT Family!"

4.0,"Taste:  2 oz. neat in Glen cairn glass.  This is a 2019 bottling.

Nose:  Oak forward with some nice dark orchard fruits and granny-Smith apple.  There is a browned butter aroma that I want more of.  Enticing nose that announces that this is likely to be a very good pour.  My ""last few drops"" nosing (always like to do this to confirm my initial nose and capture anything I missed as it evaporates a bit from the glass) gives some of that delicious cherry.

Palate:  It is oaky, but not tannic.  It is buttery but not oily.  Those nice red fruits coupled with the sourness of green apple play nicely together.  I also get some smokey char best described as an almost smokehouse vibe.  Very inviting and a note I have not picked up on in other EC offerings.

Finish:  Long an pleasantly warming with oak, smoke, caramel, red apple, and cigar box.  The finish here is where the age shines.  The edges are polished and the finish superb for its 90 proof.

Overall:  Delightful bottle of bourbon.  That said, at 150.00 srp is it worth the price of admission?  In my mind, not so fast.  Keep in mind that 2 ECBP's will cost you 60 each!  That is 2 1/2 for the price of 1.  I think although the extra 6 years rounds out the edges, and imparts a few more notes, by comparison it is not BIG and BOURBONY like it's 12 yr old sibling, lacks the richness of higher proof, and doesn't have that special buttery texture you get in the younger version.  Don't get me wrong, I love it in my collection, but it re-affirmed my theory that older and more expensive is not always better."
4.25,A little too oaky for a 18 year in my opinion. But overall a good whiskey.

4.5,"Bottled: 1-13-20
Barrel: 4931

Nose is oak first (of course), shoe polish, leather, and oak spice, but still has sweetness with bold dark caramel, butterscotch, and orange cream candy.

Palate shows a very surprising amount of sweetness for a bourbon that's been aged for 18 years. That dark caramel and butterscotch are prevalent as well as milk chocolate and some lemon/cherry notes. 

Also, this isn't too dry for 18 years old! It still made my mouth water, which was totally unexpected. Silky smooth and a slight Kentucky Hug round this one out to be a real standout for an aged bourbon. 

I do love me some aged bourbon and this one is surprisingly approachable. This is what I'd introduce to someone who doesn't like oak as much as I do. Excellent bourbon"

4.5,"**Alert** Biased review 

I received this as a gift from a friend and held on to it for a couple months until my birthday came around (today). I love Elijah Craig so he surprised me with this one. Thanks Ron! 

So upon opening this one I was reminded of the typical Elijah Craig scent. If you've ever smelled EC then you know what I'm talking about. Neck pour was pure Elijah but with all of the edges rounded out. I get sweet vanilla & toffee notes. Mmmm so good. The proof on this makes it so easy to drink & I've been really enjoying the lower proof bourbons lately as they exhibit more of their character than the high proof stuff. (of course I just picked up the A120 ECBP which is 68.6 proof). 

So the question is...… ""is it worth the $130 price tag?"" This is easy to answer for me because I don't like paying more than $40-50 for anything so no it's not for the average consumer. But, and this is a big BUT in this case I would have paid for it if I saw it on a shelf for $130. Why you ask? Well because Elijah Craig is my favorite bourbon and I really, really like their products. With the current trend of the secondary market and scumbags flipping bottles for profit I'm sure I'll never see one of these again or for that matter own another because i'll never pay more than MSRP. The current market is a sad situation but in another 10 years I suspect it will be completely different. Maybe one day again we'll be able to find good product on the shelves easily?

But each day I revisited it and it got better. Now after 4 days and just below the shoulder, it is a whiskey transformed. Still a fair amount of oak, but now there is a lot more on offer. Still not sure it was worth the price ($160) but it is a very solid bourbon."

4.75,Most bourbons aged more than 12 years taste too oaky to me but this one is pretty much perfect.  It’s got great depth while being very smooth at 90 proof and has a great balance of oak/tobacco/caramel/vanilla/fruit.  The nose is one of the best.  I bought my 18 online for $300 a couple weeks ago then got lucky and found one at goody for $150 today.  Shout out to goody for not price gouging...the staff are all great and always nice when I ask for allocated bourbons (no eye rolling).  Cheers!
