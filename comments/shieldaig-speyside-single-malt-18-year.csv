4.5,"a ""mystery whisky"" since it belongs to Ian MacLeod and it is listed as ""undisclosed distillery"".

Bottled at 40%abv, with a deep gold color. 

On the nose there are some sherry notes, blackberry marmalade, pepper, wet forest, cola and a little honey. 

On the palate is actually very good, very balanced. A sherry and caramel start, that quickly changes into a spicy mild oaky, tangerine note. Finish i long and ashy with bonfire notes, not peaty. It is not an earthy type of smoke flavor. 

This is a pretty good dram, and i think the bottle is about 43 dollars for an 18yo, (i believe they are trying to introduce the product to the market). I give this dram a solid 93 over 100, very nice."

4.0,I have yet to find a better 18-year old Scotch at this price point.  This is simply wonderful and one of the best values on the market.

4.0,smooth without a long bite. prefer very chilled
2.0,"nose is faint and sweet.
taste is friendly and fruity, red apples
finish is long and sweet.
overall pretty underwhelming, nothing here to hate, but nothing to make it stand out. I guess it's cool to get an 18 year old whiskey for cheap, but I'll take any if the other 40 dollar 12 year old whiskeys over the Shieldaig."
4.0,"very smooth not PD Kristen approved, had it as a sampling at our local liquor store in Sugarland"
4.0,"Great 18yr old scotch for the price. There are a lot better ones, but they are going to cost you triple the price. It’s sweet, easy finish. Just the right amount of wood."

4.0,This one surprised me. It’s an inexpensive scotch that I believe to be undervalued. The 12 year was a bit abrasive and didn’t impress me but this one was a pleasant surprise.

3.75,Underrated for the price. A good 18 year scotch that doesn’t disappoint but won’t exactly wow you either.
3.0,Light with hint of sweetness on nose. Smooth of palate but uneventful. Medium bite but disappears quickly. Coats the mouth nicely.

3.5,Aromas of vanilla and oak. Flavor is cracked pepper and heavy butter. Finish is long but clean.
3.5,"So I was in a rowboat, floating without oars, and I added a cube. Very enjoyable but lacking some of the complexity that I normally find in the Speysides."

2.5,"I’m getting a bit of butter flavor, followed by some oak and vanilla. It’s not very complex, but light and fairly pleasant. I guess it’s okay considering the price, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to buy a second bottle."
