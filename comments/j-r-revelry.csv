4.0,"Sourced from MGP. Light in color. Nose is a very light typical MGP profile. Palate is smooth and has a pleasant light burn on the back. Corn, but sweet not stewed. This is a simple and light pleasant sipping whiskey. Finish is short. 84-86"

1.0,"This is being pushed as a mid to upper range ""designer"" bourbon, unfortunately the sourced juice is what stands out and little else..  typically over 40USD,  not worth it at half the price. Outside of the abv, no redeeming qualities."
