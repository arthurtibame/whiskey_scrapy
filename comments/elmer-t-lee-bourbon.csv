3.5,"I was very fortunate to find this bottle at a local liquor store on the top shelf for $50.  I don't think they knew what they had and I've been back a couple times and they have nothing interesting beyond a couple of faded bottles of Weller Special Reserve at $60.  Meh.

Update: Some time oxidizing in my liquor cabinet has greatly improved this and I like it a lot more. 

Nose: Amazing.  Explodes with green apple, vanilla, baking spices, especially cinnamon, some oak in the background but mostly sweet and tart apple pie notes.

Flavor: Rich and coating but with a strong alcohol bite up front which I barely got on the nose.  Still delicious apple pie notes with buttery streusel crust.

Finish: A little short but creamy vanilla soda and then a little wood and then nada.  Not complex or long but delicious nonetheless.

I kept going back to the glass for the wonderful nose and the strong flavors but was a little disappointed by the blah finish.  Still a very nice whiskey."

Very woody at first.  Long, dry finish.  It takes a while for all the flavors to develop- this is a subtle bourbon.  There is a strong sweet rubbing alcohol like flavor from swishing it around my mouth.  Amidst this, there is a grassy and floral flavor - I get strong rose petals that come out over time.  There is a sweetness, maybe apples on the tip of the tongue.  I also get marshmallow."

5.0,Friend of mine found and gifted me a bottle of this rich and delicious bourbon. Another friend let me taste his bottle a few months ago. I have tasted around 50 different bourbon/whiskey/rye spirits and so far this is my favorite. It’s unfortunate it is so rare to find. My second favorite is tough but leaning toward High West Bourye. Many more yet to taste!

2.5,"Happened upon a dinner spot that offered pours of ETL, so I had to try one. 1oz pour in a glencairn and let it breathe for 10 minutes. It was fine. Similar to some of the other BT products, my experience is that it didn't live up to the hype. Good citrus and vanilla on the nose, but that's where it ended for me. Taste profile and finish were too spicy and a little earthy. ""Just like blantons"" was what I was told, but I disagree. I'll drink it again if offered but probably won't buy a bottle."

I’d be surprised if wheat wasn’t in there somewhere. Good bready sweetness, and it lingers."

4.75,"Elmer T. Lee: yet another elusive Buffalo Trace bourbon that continues to increase in cost and decrease in availability. When I saw this one, I knew I had to pull the trigger. It's a single barrel, sour mash release, making it a little unique to the BT portfolio.

Nose: Spicy but refined. Clove, black pepper, and baking spices. Classic Buffalo Trace leather and cherry jump right out of the glass. There's also vanilla, toffee, Gala apple, cocoa, honey, and caramel. Maybe even a little peach in there. And of course, a very prominent aroma of quality oak. Phenomenal.

Palate: The cherry and leather are still present, but they take a back seat to apple, vanilla, caramel, raisin, and toffee.  Very mild orange citrus. Here and there I pick up a nice slice of apple pie. The spice from the nose is still detectable, but the sweeter notes really take over here. There's even some maple syrup and honey.  Once again, big oak, and it's damn good. While the nose delivers a profile that is distinctly Buffalo Trace, the palate encapsulates what I'd call the classic bourbon character.

Finish: Moderate. Cinnamon, black pepper, and baking spice provide a kick. Once again, the oak shines here.

About as good as it gets on a hot summer day. This is subtle, nuanced, and one of the most drinkable whiskies I've had to date. Dangerously easy. Yet, there's enough going on here to distinguish this one from some of my other favorites from Buffalo Trace.

I nabbed this oen for $70, though I've seen it for about double. $70 is fair; maybe a bit high, but I understand the game BT is playing here. It's still one of the more affordable options in their lineup, even considering inflation. It's so good that I'd gladly overpay, though anything north of a C-note is absurd.

Either way, this is one hell of a dram. For now I'll leave it a 4.75. It's simply amazing. Of course, I'd highly recommend this to any fellow BT fanboy or for anybody who appreciates a subtle, nuanced bourbon. Might add to this post in the future. I've got Col. Taylor SB and Rye, as well as Weller 107. Can't wait to get into some comparisons between these heavy hitters."

3.75,"I had been searching for this bottle for a long time and finally got a chance to get it at a lottery at my local shop. I’ve been wanting to compare it to other Buffalo Trace mashbill #2 bottle and now I get to. But here is a review of just this bottle.

The nose is very fruity, bright red apple in particular. There is also baking spices (cinnamon in particular), leather and oak. There’s also a brown sugar, a touch of vanilla and rye.

The palate has a soft, light sweetness and slightly oily texture. I get cooked apple with baking spices, oak, vanilla and a touch of leather.

The finish has some fruit and spices with a nice medium burn. It gets slightly bitter as it fades on this medium-long finish.

I enjoy this one. A little more of a burn than I’m used to for 90 proof, which is not a bad thing.
In my memory, this one seems like the fruitiest of the Buffalo Trace mashbill #2 bunch. I can’t wait to see how it stacks up side-by-side to the others in this mashbill!"

4.25,"Vanilla/oak nose. A spicy front, with a full brown sugar, honey, and vanilla profile. Full/oak in the middle, and a perfect Tennessee hug to finish. One of the best I’ve had. It’s got everything you’d want in a bourbon."

3.75,Delicate nose of maraschino cherries orange zest and lemon rind. Oak is mush more present on the palate with vanilla clove and nutmeg layering over the fruit. Everything comes together nicely in the finish and creates a very cohesive drink
4.75,"Unreal. Cinnamon, petrol, viscous fruit, orange peel, cardamom, and caramel. One of the best ive had."

2.5,"Carmel and light nose. Gives way to light cherry over time. Definitely close to Eagle a Rare. 

Very light palate. Short finish. Pleasant but lacking. 

I use the rating scale below. Distiller uses a scale of 5 and I use a scale of 10, but I’m sure you’re not too drunk to do the math! 

1. Disgusting - So bad I poured it out.
2. Poor - I wouldn't consume by choice.
3. Bad - Multiple flaws.
4. Below average - Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.
5. Good - Just average.
6. Very Good - Better than average.
7. Great - Well above average.
8. Excellent - In a league of its own.
9. Incredible - An all-time favorite.
10. Perfect"
