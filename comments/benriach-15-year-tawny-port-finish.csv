4.0,"Dried red fruit on the nose and on the tongue. Sweet, soft and fruity. A hint of cinnammon at the final. With a strong red wine finish. The wine taste mix well with the dried fruit. You feel the wine feeling on your tongue too."

4.0,Fruity and well balanced. One of my favorite port casks.
4.0,"Very nice drop. Number 2 on the night after the Bowmore Double the Devil (a clear winner).

Very strong honey note, berry creme brulee. Port takes the back seat here. I have a feeling like most Benriachs it would deteriorate pretty quickly once the bottle is open as it doesn't have a lot of oily body to hold back oxegenation of the flavor"
4.25,"I was looking for this one for quite some time because I really much like BenRiach so far. I had their PX cask previously but I put in the extra buck to get a bottle of this one which is also part of BenRiach's special wood-finish series. And it is worth it. Really is. While the PX is good, this Tawny Port is quite a bid better.

It has the nice richness of the regular 16y plus some very present dark, fruity and mature port aroma, that hits you directly when poured into a glas.

NOSE: marzipan, fresh brown sour apple juice, dark honey mead, mulled wine, mango, ripe black currant & dark gooseberries - all sweet and at the same time equally sour. There is no obvious alcohol present and it is very smooth on the nose.

Also - I don't know if you know it - there is something called ""fruit leather"", which is basically dried fruits, that you put into a blender, roll out and let dry to create a leather-like product. This Tawny Port whisky smells like this kind of fruit leather made from fresh dark red sour apple plus some other orchard fruits.

PALATE: It definitely is a medium old BenRiach, which is really well expanded with this port finish. It is gentle and smooth in the beginning, and you still don't get much distraction of it its 46% ABV. After a short while you definitely get the wood from the cask which ""tells"" you a story about its history in bourbon oak. Then you also get the port wood again with some fruity sour sensation and mild bitterness, which joins together nicely.

FINISH: The only little downside is that the port intensity doesn't stay very long and what remains is the oak characteristics and a very mild sourness, which tells you that the Tawny Port finish wasn't all too long I assume. The stronger this special cask-finish is present first on the nose and mid-way through the palate, the less it remains in the finish.

All in all this is very enjoyable and something special. You find yourself thinking ""Yeah, this one is really good"" while drinking ... ""Was it really that good?"" ... ""Yeah ok it is still really nice indeed."" It definitely reflects Speyside characteristics and with this smoothness and mature fruity flavours makes a perfect evening dram ... or two."

5.0,"February 18, 2017 at The Irish Heather Gastropub actually the rare (not listed on this app) 18 year. Only 597 bottles made. We loved it and purchased bottles 136 & 137. 

$35/dram in house

From cask #10300 in a limited run of only 597 bottles, this particular BenRiach offering only available in BC and Alberta absolutely resounds with the influence of port at a hefty strength of 54.2%. Port is a fortified wine made in Portugal where fermentation is stopped preserving natural sugars. Distilled in 1998 and bottled in 2016, this part of BenRiach’s expansive wood experimentation under master distiller Billy Walker"
5.0,"Nose: cream, caramel, light porto.  Taste: Grapes, porto again, cinnamon.  Finish: dry, peach and oak."
4.0,whoa baby! Big and deep fruit. Big pow at first and finishes lighter but still tasty.
