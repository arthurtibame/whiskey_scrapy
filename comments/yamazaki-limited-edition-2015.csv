4.25,"Prices for Japanese whiskies have skyrocketed in recent years, and bottles like the Yamazaki Limited Edition have become as rare as hen's teeth. On the nose, there is a complex bouquet of lush sherry notes, delicate spices and juicy fruits. Sandalwood, incense and hints of matcha interweave with leather, melon and distant plum liqueur. Feisty and aromatic in the arrival, the taste turns fruity-sweet and gingery in the development, always in perfect balance. Cherries, prunes and mild tannins remain in the finish. A great malt, but heavily overpriced.
