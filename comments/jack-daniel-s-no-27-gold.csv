3.0,It's a great smooth whiskey. I like the maple note. I tasted this in London. Costs $100. The only reason I'm giving it three stars is that it isn't worth that kind of money. It certainly isn't better than single barrel barrel proof.

4.0,"Honey, ripe apple, butterscotch and maple on the nose. Smells “sweet” compared to  no.7. On the palate vanilla hits first but not overpowering, followed by light maple, and a slightly smokey and pepper-spice.  Finish fades to light sweet caramel with a hint of vanilla. Easily the 2nd best series offering from JD behind the bolder (and higher ABV) Sinatra series."

2.25,"I have had some recent success with some of the limited Jack Daniels offerings which I really enjoyed. This is not one of them unfortunately. Before I tell you why let me explain what's different about this release:

1) Previously a travel and Tennessee only release is now widely available.
2) This takes fully matured Jack Daniels distillate and finishes it for 10 months in a toasted maple barrel
3) It's then run thru the maple charcoal filtration for a second time to try and remove tannins and astringency (hint it doesn't work)
4) It's bottled at a disappointing 40% abv and retails for $100.

So why don't I rate this one? Let's dive into the notes:

As it enters it's a decent mouthfeel for the low proof. Maple syrup and spiced banana notes. Pleasant enough but that is where it falls apart. Tannins and oak become very dominant and very out of balance. A nice chocolate dipped banana note of the finish somewhat redeems it but it's too little to late. 

So even trying to ignore the ridiculous SRP on this one it's still not a great pour. Disjointed and overly sweet and drying. Not my cup of tea. 

Cheers all!"

2.25,"On the nose, the classic banana profile of Jack Daniels. On the palate, sweet biscuits, slight spice, a bit of turpentine at the end. Gets more bitter over time. 7/19/19"
null,I remember liking it at 9 a.m. in an airport – strong.

4.25,"Maybe the best expression of Jack Daniel's i have tasted so far. This No. 27 Gold is a very sweet, easy drinkable whiskey with clean aroma and tasting notes. 

On the nose it is wonderful. Almost perfect. Honey, Prunes, Maple syrup, Molasses, Grape juice, Thick caramel. Complex and sweet, Pepper spice. The honey on this is something else, Clove. 

On the palate it is too straightforward but still a good dram. Vanilla, rum and molasses. 

Aftertaste is very good too. Very sweet. Honey, pepper and burnt hay. Very pleasant.

Overall this is one good whiskey. For only one point it didn't make it to the 4.5 stars. 89 over 100."
