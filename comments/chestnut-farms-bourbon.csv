4.5,"Absolutely amazing, I've replaced my Angels Envy, Bib & Tucker, and Blanton's with Chestnut Farms as my go to burbon.  Great on the rock (large cube) or as an Old Fashion."
4.5,Person said it was like Henry McKenna and this smells of Carmel and corn. It's a solid bourbon spicy with oaky finish

2.0,"50 / 100. Spicy but with a smooth finish, though no sweetness. A good introductory bourbon, by Sazerac/Buffalo Trace, and suggested by Total Wine. An oaky high rye bourbon, though not has high proof as I prefer. Comparable to (and sometimes preferred to) the low proof (46.1%) releases of Old Scout Single Barrel 10yr bourbon. Much preferred over the 1792 with its unattractive aftertaste."

4.0,Another Pearson reviewing this on Distiller said it was recommended by total wine in Florida. I was told a long story about this at total wine in Seattle. It is not to hot.  Easy to drink. Has a fruity nose. Fast years. Light spice on the back of the mouth. Not very oily.  Good drinking. I would say 3.8 ish 3.9.
4.0,Sweet. A kindle linger. Not too hot. Very easy to drink!

4.0,"Mild sweet corn flavor.  Brown sugar finish- a little too light bodied.  Dry, woody finish.
Above average, but not exceptional."

4.0,"Burnt brown sugar and banana on the nose.  Banana, brown sugar, and a bit of wood on the palate.  It's pretty enjoyable, just too expensive for what it is."
3.5,"Standard copper color.
Light butterscotch, vanilla and wood notes dominate the nose along with a hint of cotton candy and sweet mustard.
First sip is bitter wood and tangy fruit, but later settles into a strong dry oak presence with a white pepper finish. 
Mouthfeel is medium with a comfortable burn on the upper back of the throat.
This is a standard, middle of the road bourbon at a very comfortable price point... especially if you prefer your bourbon oaky and dry. 3.6."

3.0,Slight bite at the very beginning and again the very end. Minimal lingering. Mouth feel is pleasant. Smells and tastes faintly of bananas. I also get some caramel.

4.0,"Banana and hints of brown sugar.  Walnuts.  There is a lot to like here, I just wish it had a heavier, oilier mouthfeel.  Lingering woody finish.  I feel like this is ""technically"" good, but it's definitely missing something that I really want to find.  I can't call it bad, because it's not, it's just lacking a certain something.

I'm enjoying this, there are things that I really like about it, but I wouldn't buy it again if that makes sense, particularly not at $50/bottle."

3.75,I prefer this to buffalo trace. Trace almost has too sweet of a taste. This one is a better flavor.

2.75,"The nose and palate are very similar. Reminds me of gold medal ribbon from Baskin Robbins, that beautiful vanilla ice cream laced with caramel ribbons. It sticks around on my tongue, but the thing that lingers most is ethanol. Kinda thin otherwise. For $50, there are much better bourbons, but I enjoyed this boy."
