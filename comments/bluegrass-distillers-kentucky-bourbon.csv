4.0,"This is a super-sweet bourbon. At 80% corn, of course, it's going to be. Rye makes up the other 20%, leaving a spicy after note.
Bluegrass is six months away from their bourbon going straight. I'd be interested to see what it tastes like at that point, and then again as it ages further. It's enjoyable now, even as young as it is, and I think it's just going to get better!"
