3.0,"High West MIdwinter, watered down.  It's not bad, but the expectations set after their first release (Cornerstone) made me think this will be equally good.  Decent for the price, but get the Cornerstone , if you can find it, which is at the same price and much better."

3.0,A bit disappointing. Went on the Whisky Advocate rating which is too high.
1.0,Nose of stewed fruits and plum wine. Unpleasant bite on its way down and a sour aftertaste. I’ve had some good wine-finished whiskies but this one didn’t work for me.
