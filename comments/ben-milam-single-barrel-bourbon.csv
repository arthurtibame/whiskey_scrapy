4.0,"Would be a three, but at the price, definitely a four. 
Bonus of vanilla and caramel without cinnamon"

4.0,Sweet vanilla nose. Sweet oak flavor & finish. Mild alcohol lingering flavor with sweet oak flavors. Recommend to anyone that wants a very simple bourbon.

4.0,"I get a faint caramel scent on the nose. Body had an incredibly sweet mouth feel, almost like a scotch. The only flavors I can pick out are syrup and powdered sugar. Finish turns into alternating flavors of cinnamon and cherry. That cherry runoff is delicious.

This tastes like breakfast."

This smells & tastes like stale cereal. It legitimately reminded me of Kix cereal and not in a good way."

3.5,A pretty standard bourbon. Obviously sourced though not as apparent on the label as it should be. I look forward to real or more interesting releases from this company.
3.0,"When I bought this bourbon I thought it was Texas bourbon. I am confused about it’s real origin. I felt it is no sincere to label it as Texas bourbon that actually made in Tennessee. Regardless it is relative smooth, sweet, a typical bourbon."
4.5,"Pallet: Vanilla, maple, low burn, smooth finish. Great sipping bourbon, prefer on rocks"

4.25,A little caramel scent on the nose. Taste had a pleasant sweet mouth feel. I pick up caramel and powdered sugar. Finish is mild cinnamon and cherry.  Very mild pour but delicious easy drinker.

3.5,"Smooth, little to no bite. Slightly sweet with the classic bourbon notes of vanilla and some oaky-ness. Not very distinctive, but a pleasant and easy drink."
