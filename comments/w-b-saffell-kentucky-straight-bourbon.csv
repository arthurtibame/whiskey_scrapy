5.0,Great juice. Alot of spice with very little. burn
4.25,"Neat.  Intense vanilla all over the nose.  Oak and spice as well.  Something citrus hiding behind everything.  Very nice on the nose.  A thick, syrupy but not creamy texture on the tongue.  Tons of brown sugar gives way to tons of vanilla.  Gives way to oak.  Vanilla legs for miles.

It is incredibly smooth for a 107 and very flavorful.  Delicious and enjoyable but also over priced.  If it opens up though, I may change that last sentence."
3.0,Floral nose. It's a potpourri-ish Wild Turkey. Balanced sweetness. Slight young note. 4/26/19

4.0,Strong butterscotch smell to start. Very smooth and great to drink neat. Wish it was a little more spicy. Not very complex but sure goes down easy. I would recommend as a great starter to an evening. Will pick up again if on sale.
4.25,"The nose hits you at first with oak and cinnamon, with vanilla, butter, molasses and a hint of salt and leather rounding it out. The palate is dry and rich, with oak, cinnamon, creamy vanilla, molasses and a bit of smoke. The finish is long and spicy with oak that lingers, while vanilla and molasses fade slowly."

5.0,"When I first saw this for $40 for a 375ml bottle I scoffed at it and moved on. It was only after a buddy of mine started talking it up that I decided against by better judgement that I would grab a bottle. The nose is sweet and full of nutmeg, cinnamon, caramel and graham cracker, like a cinnamon honey teddy graham. The palate follows right along with layers of flavor that present themselves in such a way that you get to enjoy each one. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy and the finish goes on and on. I swore I could still feel the warmth and the sweet spices for over two minutes (YMMV). I have not tried the other Whiskey Barron expressions but my several people I know say that this runs circles around them.

Closest comparison I could make is a dusty Wild Turkey 101. Since those can be pretty tough to find I highly recommend this bottle. If you would pay retail for a bottle of Barrell or a Wild Turkey Master's Keep, go get a few of these."

2.5,Just a nice typical bourbon taste. Not worth $50
4.25,"I’ve heard good things about this, so I eventually coughed up $50 for a 375ml bottle. Let’s see how it is.

This is Batch 1

On the nose I get a subtle red apple note with maple brown sugar and oak char. Vanilla, rye, some baking spices and a little bit of saw dust complete the image.

The palate has a nice thick mouthfeel. Its really not too sweet, just a the right amount of sweetness. I get a decent amount of rye, vanilla and some corn, as well as some cinnamon and dusty barn. 

The finish is nice and long. A slow little burn down the throat with lingering dusty rye and a little bit of vanilla.


 I like this. I can definitely see how this is a Wild Turkey product. I even poured a little WT 101 to compare. WB Saffell was more interesting and satisfying to sip (thicker and denser flavors). But WT 101 was no slouch."
4.25,Batch 1.

4.0,"Batch 1 limited run sour mash whisky sitting at a nice 107 proof.

N: Maple syrup immediately with walnut and a floral note (geranium?). Hints of mint and lemon zest show up afterwards. Once it's had room to breathe, it starts to smell like a pecan pie with caramel drizzle and a dusting of cinnamon...and occasional hints of rye and corn.

P: Initial hit of rye grain fades quickly into a nutty walnut mid-palate with some heat. This eventually turns into a sweet, then bitter, campfire wood (not smokey, just earthy)

F: Earthy, alternating sweet and bitter, raw cocoa.

Honestly this is one of the best pours I've had in a while. The profile here isn't usually my thing, but it's very well executed and at this high proof it plays perfectly. Definitely proofed to taste.


More cinnamon on second nosing"

3.75,"These small bottles are cute, but pricey when compared to a normal bottle. Nose is brown sugar and burnt caramel. First sip is spicey and caramel forward. A bit heavy on the alcohol burn for my personal taste. Finish is very corn heavy. Overall a good pour, but overpriced compared to other options at the price."

3.75,"First it’s 53.5% not 53%

Nose: nice balance of caramel and vanilla. Has a creamy vanilla tone to it. Cherries a little bit. Little to no spice

Palate: rich, honey. Spice is there. Honestly taste a bit of age, not sure what the estimated age is if anyone has guessed. Kinda reminds me of woodenville a little. 

Palate: creamy and soft butterscotch."

4.25,This is what Kentucky spirit should be.  This is classic turkey turned up to eleven.  Not quite as pushy as rare breed but has more flavor.  While it’s not game changing whiskey this is what I wish wild turkey had in there portfolio on a regular basis.  Similar to Russell’s reserve single barrel if you happen to get a good one.

5.0,"Sweet caramel nose with fresh matured oak and sweet candy corn.  Taste is exceptionally balanced and smooth for a 107 proof, dangerously easy to drink and get out of hand...  Flavor is extremely balanced with a long sweet oaky finish, one of the best bourbons I’ve had in a while and I’m a mainly scotch guy..."
