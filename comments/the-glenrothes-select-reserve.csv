1.75,68.  A bit harsh and spicy. Had what I thought was this at Ami and Nancy's but this doesn't taste like what I remember.  What they had was much smoother and sweeter. I wouldn't buy this for my cabinet (at least the Select Reserve).

3.0,"Cheerful nose that's intensely sweet and aromatic, apple-blossom, sugared cereal, wildflower honey, all atop a wonderful layer of fairly pronounced petrichor... One of my favorite notes! Satisfying palate of sweet spiced apple-butter and malt, followed by a short-but-sweet, complimenting finish. For this gentle, simple style, I'm impressed. Despite being NAS, it has no obvious flaws (i.e. overly hot or disparate flavors) and it's quality and character redeem itself. Fairly priced (for now), this would be perfect for new single malt whisky drinkers, even if hardened old Islay fans turn their nose up at it..."

3.0,"While not as flashy, complex, or well-integrated as some of the age statement selections from Glenrothes, this is still a perfectly fine dram. Dried fruit, caramel, vanilla, spice, and coconut.

3.0,"This Single Malt from the heart of Speyside is easily accessible, not very complex and comes without an age statement. The nose is characterized by toffee/caramel notes, citrus fruits and engaging hints of baked plums. However, the occasional spiritiness and rather intense brown sugar sweetness might be off-putting to some. On the palate, Glenrothes Select Reserve is mildly spicy and sweet with honey, vanilla cream and ripe fruits. The finish is short, clean and slightly dry. An average everyday dram which is comparable to a better Blended Scotch.

    Pallet: Watery mouth feel, honey, vanilla give way to peppery spice and oak.
    
    Finish: Charred oak, a bit a grassy note like hay. Spice lingers on the cheeks but not on the tongue. Short/Medium length.
    
    I find this to be very middle of the road. The nose is pleasing and not aggressive, but the pallet and finish does not have a lot going on. This is an every day sipper."

Bottled at 40%abv, with a deep copper color.

On the nose very sweet, and appealing, maybe soft. Almonds, caramel, dry chocolate cake, sherry, grape juice, those sweets from formal parties, dry brown grasses and custard cream notes. Really nice.

On the palate, starts with cough syrup, the some pepper and ginger, with a mild citrus or prune note, and the taste of the finish is lovely with cremé brulee, almonds and little tobacco, medium long.

Overall i give this fellow a 91 over a 100. Actually pretty good."
