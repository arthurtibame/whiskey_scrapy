4.0,"An amazing new mature bourbon with lots of  licorice and subtler hints of flavorful coffe with heavy cream.
With a medium viscosity there is a pleasant persistent tingle across the pallet ...
No real burn or rye bite.  
This isn't exactly a dessert bourbon but it's close.
Sampled neat...  As all whiskey should be."

2.0,Nose is sweet but with a smoky punch. Smoke/oak comes full swing on the palate with a bit of spice. Very weak/disappointing finish.

4.0,Fantastic bourbon for a low price tag.  This bourbon will whip others with twice the price tag.  Blown away by the taste.

3.0,"Nothing comes on very strong on the nose. There is some buttered popcorn and vanilla eventually, along with a bit of nougat. The palate is not rich but it is buttery. You get more vanilla and some pepper at the end. It has a slightly warming medium finish. A little spicy pepper followed by vanilla and a touch of citrus. Overall, underwhelming especially at the price."

2.5,Nothing to write home about. Price point for a 12yr is good but wouldn't buy again. I was tasting this and then the Weller Special Reserve and enjoyed the Weller better.

4.0,Not real complex but a nice surprise.  Would buy it again.  Good for an every day sipper.

2.5,"Inhale aroma at first uncork was sweet and apple-ish. Inhale aoma at first pour was still sweet, less apple, maybe a hint of vanilla. First sip was a rush of airy and pepper-spice. After sitting for a few minutes, aroma and flavors settled down to mild sweet, hint of peppery. Nothing noteworthy. Pretty straight forward in flavor - no complexity."
