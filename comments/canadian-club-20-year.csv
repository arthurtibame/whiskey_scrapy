4.25,"Brown sugar on the nose. 

Sweet on the palate. Again brown sugar. A large square of it. Some wooden notes in there as well. Maybe a bit of pepper? The finish seems to last forever."

2.5,"This one was on my list. Not bucket list as if this was one of my aspirational experiences in life i might as well give up now. Anyhow it was cheap and foolishly my friends let me choose this round so we had one each. One mate commented he thought I was joking when he heard me order the ""whiskey for those that don't like whiskey"" (was this actually their slogan once?) or brown vodka as its known. Don't worry I told him it's 20 years old not the cheap nasty stuff...oh wait what if it was the cheap nasty stuff left to lounge around for 20 years slowly sucking the life out of a poor maple tree barrel...perhaps I didn't think this through that well. But hey a 4 star rating on Distiller that has to mean something doesn't it? Well lets say apparently not in this case. It was like a sweetly insipid low alcohol bourban had an illicit affair with a blended whiskey of ill repute and this is what popped out 20 years later. So no not a 4 star experience."
