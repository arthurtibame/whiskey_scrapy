1.75,"Nice nose. After that, it’s all downhill. Very weak taste, nothing lingering at all. Very flat without a finish. Would not recommend the price of this bottle."
5.0,Unfortunately I don’t have any other birthday bourbons to compare this to but this is out of this world good. Had the first sip of the bottle and so glad I splurged a little bit. A bargain for what I paid!
4.25,Spicy with a significant burn. Dark amber coloring. Mellows as it airs and becomes more complex. Heat upfront.
4.5,Not a BF guy but this is great. Top notch

5.0,"Sweet, round, oily, thick, no heat"
4.0,"nutty & oaky. tried to drag out the sweetness with extended holding in mouth or a drop of water, but it never showed up.  great bourbon but a little extra sweetness would have taken me over the top."
3.0,Sour. Makes the mouth pucker and taste of artificial cherry.

4.75,"This morning I was fortunate to get find this Bourbon and it definitely does not disappoint! 

Entry is big and rich. Vanilla, cinnamon rolls and butterscotch. Definitely sweet initially but then it transitions wonderfully to add cinnamon and clove spice to balance out the sweet notes. As it finishes you get the oak, sweet tea and pepper that lingers long after the sip is done!

This is the highest proof Birthday Bourbon release to date (105 proof) and I think Old Forester in general benefit from the higher ABV. This is definitely the case here. SRP is $99.99 and a total of 120 barrels (approx 13,200 bottles) made up this year's release. For me this is one that definitely lived up to it's hype. Cheers all!"

4.25,Soooo sweet lil burn at the end which lingers on your tongue.

4.5,"Nose is sweet and fruity with a hint of cookie dough and molasses. At first soft on the palate but comes on strong. Classic Old Forester flavor, but more complex. Oily on the lips. Finishes strong and slow. A quick hint of menthol then cinnamon. Superior."
5.0,Vanilla on the nose. Vanilla and sweet at the very front. Brandied cherries and strong peppercorn at the end.

4.0,"Honey, brown sugar, spearmint hints, orange zest on the nose. Palate is complex, I’m getting dark chocolate and hints of cherries, oak is heavy. Light heat going down on the finish. Give it a minute or two to open up, it’s a clash of flavors. 

Edit: think 1910 on steroids - this is it"
4.0,"Tasted neat. 

Nose: 2.3/3.0
Sweet, with a mild alcohol note and smells of charred oak and an underlying caramel. Nothing stood out, and the smell was very welcoming.

Palate: 2.0/3.0
Initial sweetness and tastes of caramel cake and even icing. The alcohol burn creeps through but isn’t very powerful. I didn’t get a lot of oak flavors with this one, even at 11 years old. This ones seems to drink at or below its proof.

Finish: 2.5/3.0
Long finish with a mild alcohol note and sweetness that lingers. Subtle taste of birthday or caramel cake in the background. This one is easy to sip on.

Overall I’d say this one is very similar, in my opinion, to the OF 1920. The notes I draw are very similar, although the 1920 is less sweet and has more of an alcohol burn(52.5 vs 57.5)

I enjoyed this pour but don’t know that I can justify the price of the bottle when compared to 1920."
4.5,"Tasted at a bar for $28/heavy pour.

Nose has toasted marshmallow, brown sugar, raspberries, cotton candy, oak, and light leather.

Palate has a nice oily and creamy mouthfeel. Raspberries, brown sugar, oak, and a touch of rye.

Finish is sweet berries, brown sugar. There is a slight ethanol note that comes up at the beginning of the finish, but it passes quickly. A very pleasant and long finish.


I really enjoyed this. And I’m glad, it wasn’t a cheap pour. But now I know what I had been missing. Probably the nicest mouthfeel I’ve had, and the berry notes throughout are unique and very pleasant."

4.0,First time trying a Birthday. Sweet and Spicy Carmel with a long spicy Carmel finish. It’s pretty good but not worth the hassle of finding it.
4.75,"At dinner eating BBQ so notes are light...
N: smells like 1920 to me, rich caramel, creme brûlée, spice notes, heavy whipping cream, vanilla 
P: mouthfeel like liquid glass, white pepper, leather, caramel, vanilla 
F: atomic bomb heat for this low of proof, heat drops off but lasts for days, classic bourbon flavors linger, some rye spice, butterscotch at the end"
4.5,Lots of cherries and spice. I preferred it with some water. Glad I got to try it before opening my bottle

5.0,"Neat. Neck pour.  Great first impression on the nose.  Deep bread notes and oak reign supreme.  Cherries and vanilla.  Burnt caramel.  A really nice cherry pie all around.  Buttery qualities.  Hint of banana as it opens up.

Nice creamy feel.   Deep brown sugar and cinnamon on the tongue.  Transitions to banana punch, into the burnt caramel.  Ends on the cherries and vanilla.  This is so so good.

Hype on this release is real.  This is overwhelmingly delicious."
4.75,"Taste:  2oz. neat in glen cairn.

Nose (4.5):  Love the nose on this one!  Cherry and vanilla dominates.  If there is any flaw it may be that there is a slight hint of acetone/nail polish remover.  It is not off putting but it takes what would be a 5 on the nose and moves it down just a tad.

Palate:(5) Fantastic palate.  The sweet cherries turn just a bit tart and smokey, caramel and oak come in after a strong hit of vanilla.  You would never guess  proof above 100 as this gives off hardly any ethanol hug.  It is warming into your face and feels like a warming blush with a smile.  The higher proof points amplifies the superior flavors and richness.  It does not detract.  This is really well done.

Finish: (4.25)  The sweetness gives way to dry oak and sweet tea.  I would have liked those cherries a little more on the finish and maybe a little less dryness, but you can't win them all.

Overall:  Tremendous dram.  Exceeded my expectations.  One of the best I have had this year.  It is a refined, gentlemanly sip with exceptional nuance.  Only rough edge maybe the OF signature nail polish thing on the nose and the quick dryness on the finish.  That oaky dryness though may be a plus for some enthusiasts.  It does well to showcase the age."

4.25,This is great. I did a side by side with the 2018. This one is much better. The 2018 is an oak bomb but lacks the finish of the 2019. This has an incredible finish for the proof. I would buys this if you can find it under $150 bucks.

4.5,"The nose is the most classic bourbon nose I think I’ve ever smelt. It’s brown sugar and toasted caramel and cinnamon and fresh leather with a wisp of smoke. It tastes like it has some proof to it, but with a ton of flavor and complexity. Worn leather and a bit of must like I’m standing in a rickhouse. There’s a backbone of caramelized sugars and the smoke left over from putting a candle out. A tiny bit of spice on the front does not linger past the throat, and it finishes shockingly smooth. Medium long flavor on the finish with most of the smoke and leather shining through. This is a perfect example of what bourbon should be. Really love this."

4.75,Lots of rich sweetness. Brown sugar and vanilla. Finish lasts awhile. A little heat on front end but not harsh for higher proof. Like it very much.
3.75,Different. Vanilla cherry and oatmeal taste. Pretty good but not worth secondary.

4.75,"Nose: Black cherry, Cherry Coke. Mild brown sugar, cinnamon. Taste: Vanilla, black cherry, mildy sweet, cinnamon; light, medium finish. Warm not hot."
4.75,"The nose is very unique almost perfume like if somebody made a raisin and vanilla perfume . Have not had this nose in really any bourbons for the most part and am stuck just smelling it intrigued!
I do get that cookie dough vibe almost the same as the regular line of old forester line where it has almost that fake store bought sugar cookie vibe to it with the frosting vibes you’d get at Kroger’s or Albertsons. The nose does hunt at a tad bit of barrel char and smoke or it’s that I honestly didn’t clean out my glencairn enough after my sample of Amrut yesterday. I’m honestly not entirely sure but I felt I did a pretty good job!
The palate should offer some more notes immediately I’m hit with citrus lots of citrus with barrel char my first intial response is damnnnn I can’t get another replacement for this ! It has all the oak spice it promised with loads of orange citrus zest and a nice oaky tannic with citrus vibe while also not being too bitter and tannic’-ey . The finish is more of the same and I’m sitting here contemplating whether or not I should spend the money people ask secondary for another.....
Overall I’d give this a 95/100 and if my scoring so far is correct that’s the highest so far! 
I’ve had my fair share of highly allocated bourbons and ryes yet this has taken the cake so far! 
I hate that honestly I’m going to spend about $300 or so when my stimulus check comes in because it’s worth it! Phenomenal pour and phenomenal job by them! Best OFBB by far I’ve had!"
