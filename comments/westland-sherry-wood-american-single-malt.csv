3.5,"Young and spirity with stone fruits, citrus and malt. A splash of water helps tame the beast."
4.0,"I think I love Sherry Wood more in my head than on my tongue. I’m revisiting my Westland bottles with a shard of ice and a fresh perspective. 
SW on ice stubbornly maintains its color until the 25th hour, but the nose absolutely blossoms into this rich landscape. The palate wants to open up as well but just barely doesn’t and it keeps that astringent finish that I’m too much of a baby to ignore. That said, nothing ventured, nothing gained... we’re back at the rating we started and I’m not mad at it."
4.0,"I love Sherry Wood. A cousin of Peated apparently, both employ ex-sherry casks. Today brought me a buttery note I hadn’t previously noticed. 
Simple and elegant. This thing is like a wild horse. I’m not sure what I mean by that, but it sounds right. Like when you see a shiny, black horse running in slow motion so you see all the veins and striations. This sip is kinda like that."
3.25,Very fruity.  One note.  But good finish.  Lots of sweet fruits.

No water

Nose - sweet sherry, dark fruit

null,"Calm down on the 96 rating, very nice indeed but very young and not better than the best out there... As this rating would have you believe"

3.0,"Between the richly spiced nose and the long, dry finish is a bawling toddler of a whiskey. There's huge promise in here that a few more years' maturation will no doubt reveal, but at this age the sharpness of the taste overshadows the fruity aromas and spicy, tannic finish."

4.0,This one is all dried fruits and sherried notes on the nose. It makes you think it's going to be a Sherry bomb on the palate like an Aberlour A'bunadh or Glenfarclas but then the palate is really chill. It carries the dried fruits from sherry casks along with some fig preserves and fruit cake. Finish is moderate length with tart dried fruits like dried cherries or currants.

null,Wow... Yummy!  There's nothing more I could add to Lance's notes that isn't already there. Highly recommend.
4.0,"Throw in a splash of cold water and it's an incredible array of flavors that belie the barley and sherry casks.  Think chocolate covered espresso beans, slight oak and bananas.  Ignoring price, this is a 92-95 point dram.  More aging could yield something incredible.  Mildly overpriced at this maturity."

4.0,"In my opinion, this is a good whiskey but not a great one. I loved the nose. I smelled this for about 5 minutes before tasting because I enjoyed the nose so much. It's sweet with maple syrup, cherries, dried berries, oak and a hint of char. On first taste I was immediate let down. The overwhelming flavor and texture of the whiskey was a bitey, white pepper flavor that I was not expecting at all. After a few seconds the flavor hit in a really big way though: more dried fruits with layers of espresso and malt chocolate. The finish was medium length but the berry flavor left and it was more espresso and chocolate. All in all, I really enjoyed this but it's not a 98 in anyone's book, or it shouldn't be. I'm happy to have it on the shelf. If I could give this a 3.5 star rating I would just but I'll be honest and say that 75% of the 4 star I'm giving this is for the nose."

2.0,"I think individual taste buds explain why the professional here ranked it so high (as high as the Yamazaki 18 or Highland Park 18!!) while some of us thought it has a ways to go.  My thoughts, for what it's worth...it shows potential, but it's just not there yet.  I like the nose (sweet cherries, caramel), but then it starts to fall apart a bit on the taste, and the finish is a bit bitter and stinging, quite indicative of it's youth.   For the price---so, not worth it.  I'd like to come back, maybe a few years later, when it matures a bit.  Till then, I'll save my money for the worthwhile drams instead of financing a start up with a so-so product."

3.0,"Interesting how this one went from a ludicrously high 98 rating down to an 84.  I suppose we are all entitled to change our minds once in a while, yes?  I bought it because of that original 98 score...but I don't completely regret it.  It's quite nice as a sweetish, somewhat complex, porty spirit--albeit, it's a rather unusual tasting whiskey.  I do love the chocolate notes and the cherry-cola finish--more like a delightful dessert, really.    It will never be a ""go-to"" bottle, but I definitely like having it around for those times when I want something a little ""different"".  I'll certainly look forward to what Westland's future (and hopefully more aged) bottlings will offer.  I would rate this one in the middle of two extremes.  87/100 MMB 15-06-16"

4.0,"Nose - Sherry influence is definitely present along with the fact that you do get this young spirit bite, sweet dried dark stone fruits, toasted barley, hint of cocoa nibs.
Taste - Toasted barley, cocoa nibs, toasted puffed rice cakes, young spirit bite/burn, sweet dried dark cherries/prunes/raisins syrupy sweet.
Finish - Lingering cocoa nib chocolaty bittersweet, dried dark stone fruit syrupy sweet.
Score - 86/100
Final Thoughts - So the fact that this has probably only spent about 24 months in the barrel shows, but at the same time, what is there is quite tasty. I think some additional time in the barrels might help mellow out the young spirit bite a bit and mellow and mingle things together a bit more. The sherry influence is there and the pale chocolate malt they used really shines through and adds a delicious toasted chocolaty note I quite enjoy."
3.0,"The first Sherry'd whiskey I liked. With no smoke influence I finally understood what sherry does to a whiskey. It's fantastic and gave me a new found love for the Macallan in my collection that I had typically passed over and didn't enjoy before this whiskey! Yum!

4.5,"Odor: 
Sweet, sherry and fruit aroma, not overpowering. 

Taste:
Starts off smooth, moving to a sweet fruity flavor. Blends well with the whiskey which burns the lips, but not the tongue. 

Finish: 
Spice that starts off weak and grows stronger with a slight oak aftertaste."
4.75,"Nose:  Heavy malted barley, raisins, plums.  Warm maple and brown sugar oatmeal.  More sweetness, almost like molasses.  As a whole, it reminds me of warm oatmeal raisin cookies.  

Palate: Sweet brown sugar syrup.  Smokey cinnamon and molasses cookies again.  Damn, that is so reminiscent of warm, doughy, spiced baked goods - like pumpkin break.  A bit of spicy baking spices and rounded oak notes.

Finish:  Medium-long finish.  Mouthwatering, warm, open maltiness.  Slowly fading brown sugar sweetness.  The end is dominated by delicious oak and slight smoke.

Conclusion:  My god... I wasn't expecting this to be so good.  This has so much character, one of those whiskies you could pick out immediately in a blind test (in a good way).  Westland wanted to branch away from the Scottish way of single malts and make a defining American Single Malt.  They succeeded.  If it weren't for the hefty price tag on this, it would quickly become my everyday drinker.  I applaud Westland for what they've done here."

3.5,"First, most noticeable feature is the sweet smell of raisins. Subtle taste with a bit of a medicinal finish. Fruit is the strongest flavor, most likely from the sherry casks. I almost wonder what a peated version of this would be like."
4.25,"A whiskey sample provided by dthom as part of the ""Whiskey Transfer Program"".  This one kind of came out of left field and surprised me with how good it was.

Nose:  I've never smelled a whiskey that smells this heavily of bananas.  Brown old bananas.  Kind of liked dried banana chips.  Also raisins and figs and dates.  Heavy grain notes like corn flakes.  With the sweet notes it's almost like frosted flakes.

Taste:  The banana is there but more subdued with dried fruits like cherries, figs, and raisins taking over at the front.  Heavy caramelized sugars.  

Finish:  Still sweet but the wood notes start to stand out.  A long complex finish with oak, sandalwood, more dried fruit, and some spice.  Heavily spiced with cloves and cinnamon standing out on the finish.  Finishes very dry for such a sweet dram.

Wow I was surprised how much I enjoyed this.  Very complex and interesting."
