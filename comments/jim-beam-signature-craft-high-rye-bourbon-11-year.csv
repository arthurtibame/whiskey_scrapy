4.0,"Big rye spice, hotter than its 11 years and 90 proof would suggest.  If you find this for the price I did do not pass it up. Got it for 9.99 on clearance at my local favorite bottle shop.  Wish I had bought both, one to savor."

3.0,Nice aroma. The pepper of the rye is front and center. I liked it but at the price point there are ryed bourbons I like more.
