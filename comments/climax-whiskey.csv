5.0,very good taste. smooth
2.75,"Nose of butterscotch.  Strong alcohol taste (bite) upfront followed by hints of campfire (over charred) and finally wrapping up with the more expected, oaked whiskey flavors.  Can do with more time on oak (>24hrs) and more aging."

1.75,"The nose is pretty neutral, I can't pull any real flavors but alcohol. The taste is pretty much the same, reminds me of a cheap alcohol with a slightly woody flavor on top. The finish... I'm glad it's over."
