3.75,"I’ll start by saying my bottle is the 2019 cask strength rye humor 115 ABV. 95/5 MGP rye mix. The bottle looks the same as pictured but may be different as all of Pinhooks bottles look the same to me. 

Okay now for what is in the bottle. I’ll start by saying this was surprisingly “sweeter” than I thought it would be considering the proof and that it’s a rye whiskey. Smooth being in quotations because I think most people would say that’s not a good adjective to use but I think most whiskey drinkers will understand. The flavors reminded me of dickel rye but I didn’t have a bottle handy to try side by side but since this is using the standard MGP rye bill mash I imagine I’m not too far off. For what it’s worth, I love the dickel rye. The price was a little more than I like spending at almost $50 after tax but to splurge once in a while for something I tried before buying and also liked, I’m happy with my purchase. 

I tried this at home along 3 other ryes the other night (Wild Buck, HW Double Rye, and Templeton 4) and this was second best in my opinion  behind the Double Rye which is half the price. I bet this would be an amazing old fashioned so I’ll experiment with that next time I pull it out. 

Conclusion, yes this was a good rye but it replicates a bottle half the price (Dickel) but also has a much higher proof. So if you like Dickel rye but want a little more bite then this may be in your wheelhouse."
4.0,"Nose is caramel, vanilla and spice. Nose gives way to alcohol halfway through assessment. Taste is caramel, brown sugar, rye spice and tobacco. Mouthfeel is spectacular and viscous."
4.0,"Herbal nose of white pine, pine cones, hint of vanilla and caramel. Mouthfeel full and viscous. Palate sweet and fruity on attack, but punchy and spicy like a rye should be. Finishes like a light IPA. Lingers long with a slow and low burn, slight KY hug. Easy sipper. Does not disappoint."

4.0,Like an oily full-flavored red hot. Wonderful rye to be so young (3 years). The bottle I tried was a single barrel.
4.75,HBS Barrel Pick. Phenomenal flavor and nose. Like candy.
