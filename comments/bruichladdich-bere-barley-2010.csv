3.0,"Super greasy and malty on the nose. Almost no sweetness at all. There is very little flavor on the palate. There is still a bit of malt and bread, and most of the flavor comes on the finish, but it’s too mellow. There’s almost no taste despite the richness."

4.5,"Vibrant, very barley malt driven profile. Aromas of malt and pear. Relatively spicy on the palate, but with nice but soft oakiness. Definitely spirit driven, but that’s a good thing. Let’s the bere barley shine."

4.25,"Quite an interesting one this is. Very mellow on the nose with hints of cereal and light touches of vanilla. 

However the taste is what’s most intriguing. A slight bite from the lack of maturity but not to the level you would expect from an 8 year old malt.

The flavors are long lasting and even after full consumption there is a creamy vanilla aroma that makes its way to the nose.

Overall a very interesting scotch and worth the try."
4.5,"Peat is not overwhelming, very smooth for 100 proof single malt"
