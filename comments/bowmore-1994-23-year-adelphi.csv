4.0,"Bowmore tasting evening at The Oak Barrel, Sydney, June 26th 2019: Whisky #6

Nose: Rich, buttery, and very fruity. Some restrained sherry notes and in the background a whisper-light smoke aroma. There are also some citrus/brine notes that are part of the Bowmore house style, but they are very restrained and mainly noticed on the dry glass.

Palate: Spicy, sweet, fruity and smoky arrival. Very full and complex with great depth. Layers of flavour unfold as the development proceeds, intense in character and subtle in interaction. There is a light briny note that is restrained, like the nose, and the texture is full and rounded.

Finish: Medium/long. Brine, subtle smoke and sherry fade to a mouth-watering sweetness with a slightly ashy aftertaste.

Distilled in 1994 and bottled in 2018, this tasting was from one of 521 bottles yielded by cask #555 (given the size of the bottling and the colour of the whisky this was most likely a refill oloroso sherry butt).

A very enjoyable whisky that possesses a more open and clean character than any official Bowmore I've tasted. It was also not as tight as I'd expected, having a generous nose and palate when neat - but then it has relatively low abv for a cask strength whisky.

The addition of water produced an avalanche of fruit, particularly on the palate, and transmuted the modest salty presence into a crisp thin sweetness. Delightful either neat or diluted.

Overall I though it to be a shade superior to the official 18 year old expression and it certainly provided an interesting slant on the distillery profile. The price is, however, rather excessive - more than I think is justified.

""Very Good"" 4 stars"
