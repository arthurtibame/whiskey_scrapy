3.5,"Neat in Glencairn at home.  Nose is nutty, with vanilla and oak (surprise), some dusty hay, mild cinnamon.  No burn.  Taste brings some heat on the front, dissipates through mid palate, then returns for a nice lingering soft spice.  More nuts, vanilla, meadow grass, with some definite dryness towards the end.  I think I get the name choice: the description of the biscuits Booker liked emphasized their dryness, and this definitely has that character.  If I am being honest, not really a fan.  Adding some water helps a little, bringing out the spice more, but the finish is still dry, even xerostomic.  Swing and a miss."
3.5,"Bookers 2019-04 is a high proof Kentucky Straight Bourbon, bottled at 63.05% ABV (126.1 proof). The whiskey has been aged for 6 years, 6 months, and 19 days. It is unfiltered and hand selected by Fred Noe.

Color: Deep Chestnut

Nose: Hints of caramel, vanilla, butter, dough, and oak. 

Palate: Honey, caramel, oak, and the taste of buttery biscuits arises with a strong alcohol presence.

Finish: Medium length with more hints of caramel, oak, and strong peppery notes."
5.0,"So good. Heat is smooth, rich caramel with a light cinnamon finish. I’m all about it!!"
4.5,"Nutty booker’s nose and palate.  Smoother going down with less fruit and more barrel than last few seasons.  A fantastic sipping bourbon and again, add a splash of water to optimize the tasting!"

4.75,Cinnamon. Pepper. Butterscotch. Honey-roasted peanuts. Alcohol-forward on the nose. Suggest a couple drops of water. Let it open up.

4.75,"Nose: Oak, char, and ethanol.  Plenty of barrel going on here.  Brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, vanilla.  Smoked paprika, ground chipotle, and black pepper.  Red hots.  Dusty corn.  Chestnuts.  Chocolate covered cherries.  Mint and Gros Michel banana.  Like all other Booker's editions, there's this signature buttermilk biscuit thing going on - funny given the name of this batch.  It's this raw flour, buttery, creamy, lightly salty kind of thing that I personally find very appealing.

Palate: Dense with brown sugar, dark chocolate, cinnamon, nutmeg, oak and char, smoked paprika, Luxardo cherries.  Tannin is evident, though the palate here is so dense it's competing with a lot of other flavors.  Fruit crisp but with a ton of extra baking spices added - apricots and peaches.  Chipotle peppers.  After your palate acclimates, the tannin shows up.  Presents as high proof, though maybe not nearly the octane bomb you'd imagine.  All the flavors here are maybe a little dense and hard to pick apart at first sip, though this is absolutely Booker's through and through.  Once you acclimate and the glass opens up, There's a surprisingly good balance going on here - low, mid, and high palate notes all displaying quite appropriately.  Finish begins with a prickly pop of ethanol on the tongue, and slowly fades away with bananas, mangoes, vanilla, and white sugar playing around, a slightly minty notes comes to the fore, and then everything settles into this pleasant fennel and bubblegum combo with a solid alcohol burn.  Long finish going on here.

Other notes: Booker's never disappoints.  I do have my personal favorite batches, but I've never had a glass of this I didn't like.  My personal favorite batch I've had so far is still probably the 2018-02, but this is a solid second.  The punch here reminds me a bit of my bottle of Stagg Jr. - especially the hot cinnamon and dense brown sugar/nutmeg notes.  If you're ready to step up to the proof, Booker's is always an excellent choice, and this bottle really steps up to the plate and delivers the kind quality I've come to expect."
4.5,"I've been wanting a Booker's bottle for a while but never wanted to spend the bucks until I found one for $57.99 at Costco and I couldn't resist.  

Nose:  Even from a distance I get a powerful vanilla scent, more than any bourbon I've ever nosed.  Dark caramelized sugars, quite a bit of oak, and some leather and cigar in the background.  Just a hint of boiled peanut.

Flavor:  Sweet caramelized sugars, dark and buttery, a little bit of leather, dried cherry, and quite a bit of cinnamon and clove.  Punches way under the proof that the bottle indicates.  This comes across closer to 105 proof.

Finish:  Long finish with that Beam nutty note that I always expect but it's less peanut and more buttery macadamia nut.  Dark barrel char but not drying like I usually get from other Booker's bottlings.  Spicy finish but not overwhelmingly so.

Wow.  This is the most balanced Booker's I've tried.  They've all been delicious but all are either too heavy on the leather, too heavy on the sweetness to where it is a little cloying, or too heavy on the spice at the end.  This one just hits all the right notes for me."

4.25,The more I enjoy this bourbon the more I enjoy it. Strong sweet berry taste with a little smoke. Another great bourbon from Booker’s.

4.75,"A sweetness stays of caramel, vanilla, honey, and creme brûlée, with a richness and spice that keeps it full. Almost a nutty and salty hint at the finish. Full bodied and rich. Very good. My favorite batch in a while. Surprisingly smooth for the proof."

4.0,Still good.  Nice heat and complexity.
4.25,"My first Booker's experience and it did not disappoint! There are layers and layers of flavor that come and go with each additional sip. It is a higher proof poor that for me takes a few drops of water to bring out warm vanilla and cinnamon flavors that are hidden by the stronger flavors of oak and spice. Leather, ceder, and some honeysuckle are also present."
5.0,"Outstanding!!  Best bookers so far!  Full and complex flavor.  No burn.  Drinks like 80 proof, true validation of great small batch that’s barrel proof"

4.25,This is one of the better Bookers I have had. Reminds me of the 30th but with less oak. The 30th is better but this is close at a much lower price point. I get some caramelized orange notes on the nose and on the palate. A moderate to long finish. A great pour.

4.5,"Wow, This had a sweetness on the nose that carried through to the finish. A  dense mouth feel for me that gave the sensation of melting in my mouth.  A nice medium finish. Ever sip was a treat. Definitely NEED another bottle. This was my first dip into the Booker's line and I am sorely disappointed that I missed the bus on the cheaper offerings in the past. That said, It was worth what I paid for it."

4.5,Beautifully smooth and full of flavor
4.0,Too strong for my personal liking neat. Added about a plastic bottle cap of water and it really opens it up. Super oily and costs the tongue. It has a butter taste as well as like doughy flour taste.

4.25,"Didn't seem like much of a nose, but initial flavor on the tongue is major sweet vanilla. Intense throat heat on the swallow.  Would be great to try with some water."
3.0,I agree with most of these reviews as far as flavor but this is way hotter than my normal sip!

4.25,"Nose - roasted peanuts (bordering on peanut butter), burnt caramel, brown sugar, strong oak, vanilla frosting, corn, dry spiciness, subtle grape, high ethanol burn. 

Taste - peanuts, rich salted caramel, vanilla frosting, chili pepper, oak notes, slight citrus, strong tongue-numbing alcohol bite, finishing long with lingering peanut, pepper, and spiced vanilla flavors. 

Overall I really like it, but not quite as much as ECBP or the Bookers Shiny Barrel Batch release. However, I’m writing this review based on the neck pour of this bottle. I have a feeling it will mellow out and improve in a month or so."

4.0,"Aroma is classic Booker’s but a bit drier and more oak-driven, not as oily and sweet as many other batches; Palate is quite nutty but here the sweet notes come up to balance out the oak more; Finish is a nice even fade out of sweet and rustic notes. Water brings out even more oak and nuttiness on the aroma, on the palate it turns the fruit a bit jammy and some biscuity notes arrive that remind me of the Jim Beam Distiller’s Cut."
4.5,Rich. Layers of flavor. Smooth finish

4.5,Buttered bread up front followed by cinnamon caramel
4.25,"Very vibrant and strong aromas, caramel, oak, honey, a bit of nuts

Straight off from bottle the first sip is smooth with a less than expected alcohol heat, but it gets stronger as it opens in the glass. Sweet, very pronounced oak notes, some nuts and the body reminds of butter. Adding a few drops of water make it smoother but I feel it becomes a bit less attractive in palate.

Finish is long and is mainly of caramel and oak."
