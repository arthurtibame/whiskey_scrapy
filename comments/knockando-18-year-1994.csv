An average sherried whisky you'll easily drink and forget."

3.0,"I'm not sure if I dislike this, or hate it, so I'm giving it an ambivalent 3 stars and leaving the question open. This whisky is sherried, yes, but not in pleasant fashion - it's basically honey and spoiled fruit stew to the nose. The palate is completely flat and weak, and the finish regretfully long. Yeah, it's mostly a 2. Anyway..."

3.0,"well this is different. The sherry is not sticky or sweet. It's dry, woody with lots of nuts. The nose dry sherry, light fruity notes and that's about it. The palate is starting sweet that it turns really dry, same as with a strong red wine. In addition, there are some nutty notes and a lot of oak. The aftertaste is mainly dry oak which is lingering on for quite some time. All in all, it's a decent dram but lacks some complexity. Maybe more ABV would be beneficial. (84/100)"
4.0,In L&B. Lekker. Best zoet. Volle smaak.

3.5,I had the 1996 edition. Definitely more fruity than the basic 12 years. One hit for those who don't like the islay.

Un dalmore 18 du pauvre, très bon rapport/qualité prix"
