3.25,"Bottled by Medley Brothers in Bardstown, Kentucky.  A straight whiskey bourbon at 80 proof. Dark amber color with a smell of caramel and butterscotch. Sweet with hints of caramel, vanilla, and oak. Great finish without to much bit. A mash bill of 77% corn, 10% rye, and 13% malted barley. Great for drinking in any style."
