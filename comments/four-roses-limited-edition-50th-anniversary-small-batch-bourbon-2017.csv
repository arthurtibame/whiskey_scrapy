3.0,"On the nose, nutmeg, vanilla, and sour baked apples. Spice immediately on the tongue, the tingle lingers throughout. Baking spices, wood, leather, cider, muddled berries. Slight bitter aftertaste. Lots going on. 8/18/17"

4.0,"This was good, but good in the way that many Four Roses selects are. Now that's not a bad thing, it's just that I've got a Binny's OBSO that I like just as much and it was $55 without having to deal the furious bubble of hype surrounding this one. Good, but I'm not sure what makes it stand out as a LE. Miss you, Jimmy."

Palate: wheat, sugar spice, berries, Carmel, vanilla, sweet and spicy - extremely well balanced- all flavors and spices are equally represented at equal and appropriate times. Very very good. 

Finish: spicy, oily, long- perfectly aged."

4.0,"Vanilla & apple nose with notes of oak. Sweet gentle vanilla, butterscotch & juicy dark fruit flavor with a hint of spice. Soft spicey finish. Vanilla lingering flavor with a touch of heat. 
$13 for a 2oz pour, The Common Table, Dallas. FYI, they now know that they made a mistake on the price..."

5.0,In rocks glass. Almost muted floral and fruit aroma. Light but strong taste. Extremely high flavor efficiency. Appley sweet like Calvados. Almost eternal finish. Easily one of the best Bourbons I've had to date.

5.0,"Four Roses Al Young 50th Anniversary was likely my favorite pour of 2017. It is a perfect balance of dark cherries, vanilla, and oak. While it is barrel strength.. The heat is not overwhelming, but makes for a long and smooth finish. Highly recommended."

5.0,"Wow. the nose on this is amazing. A bouquet of flowers initially followed by honey and caramel. Keep in mind this is after letting it rest for about 5 minutes. Packed with flavors of camel, honey, hits of oak. tastes sweet in general. This would be your special occasion sipper. Definitely one of my top five. I paid through the nose on this one, but it was worth it.  Tried it neat."

5.0,"I've had the opportunity to sample a few of these releases and have yet to be disappointed. This year's release in particular I really enjoyed. So I was very thankful to have the opportunity to sample this 2017 release!! 

Here are the components that went into this release:

 5% 23-year OBSV, 25% 15-year OBSK, 50% 13-year OESV, and 20% 12-year OBSF. 

On to the tasting:

It enters with perfect balance and mouthfeel. An explosion of flavors.... classic cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper, and oak... dark fruits and caramel on the mid palette... The finish is endless adding tobacco and leather with lingering spice on the tongue... It's outstanding!

This one fully lives up to it's hype and was an absolute pleasure to taste!

Cheers All"

3.0,Blah
4.5,"The nose starts with vanilla and baking spices, followed up with oak, custard and a soft floral fruitiness. The palate is full of cinnamon and baking spices, with oak and vanilla balancing it out while followed by a floral tone, sweet fruit, caramel and buttered bread. The finish is long and peppery with creamy vanilla and oak that fades and fades."
