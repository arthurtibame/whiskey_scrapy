4.0,"Tasted this in a bar in Melbourne (Whisky and Alement) I loved it so much I ordered 2 bottles in the cab heading to dinner...

Drinking it now back at home it's still great but I'm struggling without a splash of water.

Maybe I'm getting old..."

4.0,"I have been looking for this bottle since last year, and it is nice to see Springbank do a new release! The first note on the nose was green apples, and the bourbon oak wood is heavy here. It's not overly woody though. The dunnage warehouse, might as well be Springbank trademarked, leathery goodness is in there as well. Toffee and caramel hits the palate, along with cinnamon on the back end. The taste is not hot at all for its 55.8 ABV. It reminds me of a smoothness of an Octomore, minus the peat. Vanilla forward, with a heavy mouth coat. Water opens the fruit even more so. The white grapes, peach, and pears come to the forefront, along with some honeysuckle and hay, but masks the sweetness. Very well done and a 4.5. The theme of the dram should be something from my hometown Louisville. I am thinking ""Flight Response"" by Days of the New."

4.5,"This was a blind tasting...

Really nice legs in the glencairn.

Nose- salty, brine.  Light peat, with light vanilla and orchard fruit

Palate - peat is more up front than on the nose..  same brine, with a light sweetness.

There's a lingering warm finish that transports me...  I’m wearing a shawl collar  cardigan in front of a fire on a blustery night. This is a fantastic Springbank!"

4.25,"N: Tangy pineapple, citrus zest, mineral oil, a gentle touch smoke, lemon cake.

P: Shortbread, marmalade, candied ginger, slight peat funk, saltwater taffy.

Long rumbling finish of mineral and lemon tang, berry tart, and wood influence. Subtle dessert qualities, but dry relative to the entry.

The 14 years haven't blunted the coastal influence on this, but those bright astringent and salty aspects have been married nicely with the rich dessert notes from the bourbon barrel."
3.75,"Drink this neat at your own risk - it goes down like a punch to the face. Tamed with water, it’s creamy, oily and fruity (lemons, to be precise.) The finish is long and slightly sweet. A challenging dram."

Springbank without any sherry influence is like Caol Ila without any peat.  It’s a weird one.  Springbank goes wonderfully with sherry casks because the spirit itself is sulphurous and mineral (desired, if you’re a Springbank fan), so it hides sulphur from the cask (undesired, but inevitable in modern times).  

This dram has a deviant character arc that goes from a friendly, sweet, buttery, vanilla nose and arrival on the palate, which progresses to an austere, oaky, mineral, and dry finish.  The funky, farmy Springbank distillery character is strong throughout, but it’s missing the familiar sherry influence.  I don’t get the tropical fruits that I love with most other Springbanks.  This is a more elemental Springbank.  Some quality bourbon casks were obviously used; the nose and palate are great, but the finish is just missing deliciousness, which I’ve come to expect from this distillery.  I don’t regret the purchase, but I probably won’t buy another bottle; the 12 year old CS is cheaper and more to my tastes. 

Rating (price not a factor): 90 / 100
