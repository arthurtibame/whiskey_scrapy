Hot. Hot. Hot!

A full bodied bourbon with flavors of cigar tobacco, honey, cinnamon, pepper, vanilla, and black tea. A lingering, mouthwatering acidity on the finish that begs for spiced meat and a cigar."

5.0,"Went to get a haircut and had an hour to kill since my barber was backed up. It's fortunate that my favorite Whiskey and cigar bar is in the same strip mall. So as I walk in I notice they have this Booker's for a $10 pour. Fair price and one I wanted to try. I took the plunge!
Upon entry you are hit with big sweet notes. Vanilla, peanut brittle and rich toffee. You get a barrel driven swell on the mid pallette featuring spice and cigar box. Hints of tobacco. Finish lingers and has a big hug. Rich vanilla and oak with more of that rye spice. 
It's Soo drinkable and rich. This is everything you want in high proof Bourbon. This is the best batch of Booker's I have had in years. Hard buy recommendation. This one beats out the Elijah Craig Barrel Proof offerings of this and last year. Great stuff. 5/5"

4.25,"Big, bad, and bold, this whiskey is a bruiser of a bourbon. Hefty charred notes mingling with cigar and dark cherry. Hell of a neat sipper for a cold night"
4.0,"Beautiful Carmel and Tobacco on the nose. Let it sit and the tobacco notes really come out. Wonderful oak, and Carmel on the pallet. Finish is dry with even more tobacco. shorter than most Bookers batches but leaves you with the feeling of just having smoked a cigar."

4.75,"Wow... Such sweet and fruity flavors, like almost bold dried apricots or something. The hints of vanilla are there in the nose and the taste. I thought drinking it neat would be too hot, but it's not, it's almost smooth, and has great oily texture. Easily worth the cost, as the flavors lingers and taste great for a while..."

4.75,"Tart, hot; spicy nose. Smooth aftertaste"
4.25,"Nose: oak, leather, heat. actually burns the nostrils a bit.

Opened up nicely with a small ice cube."

4.25,"I swear I was going to open with cigar smoke as my first note before I read the distiller app review. Oh well, originality is overrated. In addition to the smoky char, there's an intriguing meaty quality like bacon or sausage on the nose, in addition to more familiar candied nuts, oak and vanilla. Black pepper and peanuts, bread rolls, jerky, spice on the palate. Not many of the rounded dessert qualities you expect. Still very good, simply not as balanced and rounded as the best Booker's editions."
4.25,"Nose - Charred wood and cherries on the nose, can tell it will bite, slight vanilla

Taste - Felt like I got ran over by a spice truck! Super hot and oily

Aftertaste - Maybe my batch but I had a slightly nutty aftertaste

As someone said earlier best sipped on a cold night, this stuff is great and packs a punch"
4.25,"Sweet up front, spicy and long finish, one of my favorites in my collection."
4.25,null
4.0,"Neat.  Hit me better this time.  Maybe I was in a spicy mood.  Licorice, red hot, and hints of fruits in the back of the nose.  Can get the vanilla on a deep breath.  Creamy mouth feel.  That cinnamon spice heat hits you immediately.  Long legs.  There is a three course meal sitting behind this.  Either I adapted or this bottle opened up."

4.25,I don't give 5's soooo here we are. The taste is reminiscent of a fresh cigar or that favorite leather jacket that your dog decided to make his new chew toy. I also seem to get a slight nuttiness mixed with the tobacco. Sweet/Spiced nose with Vanilla. Wish the finish lingered longer though. Chew on my friends if you get the chance. Chew on.
3.0,"Spicy and licorice for sure. Vanilla. Oak and oatmeal. A bit young for Booker’s. An interesting ride, but missing the profile I remember from my “first favorite” top shelf bourbon."
5.0,"I have yet to have a Booker's batch that disappoints. This is as good as any I have ever had. In the absence of a side-by-side comparison, it's difficult to peg this one on the list. However, I don' think it unreasonable to say that this could be the best. It certainly holds true to the Booker's name.

Nose: Heavy caramel and roasted nut. Also vanilla and a trace of toffee. Distinctly oaky.

Palate: More oak, caramel, vanilla. The nut note here comes across as peanut, something I often get with Beam products. Slight hint of citrus, as well as some barrel smoke, and maybe even some cocoa.

Finish: One of the longest finishers, due in not small-part to the 63.35% ABV. Starts off with a caramel sweetness that transitions into spiciness and a little bit of smoke it fades away. The alcohol burn is formidable but still amazingly drinkable, even without water.

I can always count on Booker's to come through. Kentucky Chew is damn fine even when compared with its predecessors. I used to buy these for $55, as recently as a year and a half ago. More recently, I've only seen Booker's at $90. I got this one at $75. Relatively speaking, this one is a steal. Maybe $55 really was a steal, because I would happily spend $75 on a bottle of this quality again. Well done Beam. This is a truly impressive bourbon."

4.5,"First, don’t buy a pour at this hotel bar. Stupid pricey. But, they had the 2018-03, Kentucky Chew batch. It was worth it. 

NOSE: caramel, slightly burnt coffee cake, maybe almond.

PALATE: HEAT. then some heat. By the third or 4th sip, the flavors really came out. Some type of fruit, caramel, vanilla with a dark rum/choc lingering finish."

3.75,"Wow! Hot!  I definitely had to mellow this bad boy out with a few cubes. Overall it's very good, but definitely not an easy sip. Alcohol, leather and vanilla on the nose. You can taste the spice throughout the sip. Definitely feel some notes of allspice & cinnamon. Long hot finish. Be careful the finish doesn't catch you in the nose. It'll clear your sinuses!"
5.0,"okay, I admit I'm a Booker fanboy, but this is really great. In addition to the usual vanilla and brown sugar, I was getting tobacco, licorice , leather."
3.0,"Smell: strong oak aroma, burnt sugars, light floral, light alcohol
Taste: initial strong alcohol taste (expected at 126.7%), powerful oak spices, tingling sensation on tongue
Finish: powerful finish with slight burn, leaves slight numbing in mouth,  more warm than burn on the way down,  more harsh than smooth

Conclusion: disappointed in the taste given the high price point. Flavor on palate is adequate but leaves more to be desired with a $70 price point. Most disappointed with the harsh finish. Have tasted 100-125 proof before with a much smoother finish for a better value i.e. Cosy Road, Makers Cask, among others."
3.0,One fiery pour!  I tasted blind.  Flavorful but full of spice.  Strong cinnamon & cloves.  Tastes a lot like Big Red gum after some cool distilled water is added.  Thankfully it is mostly back heat so other flavors can still be distinguished.  This could rate higher than 3 stars but not at $80/bottle in NC.  I suggest this as a bar pour only at this price...w/ plenty of rocks!
4.0,Good quality bourbon from this line of Bookers.
4.75,Best bourbon I’ve had in a long time. Cinnamon. Nutmeg. Caramel. Creme brûlée. Pretty hot neat but if you add a drop or two of water it is still fantastic. I really need to find a bottle of this.
5.0,Hot!  And lovely.  Bookers never disappoints.  Needs a touch of ice or water but very good

4.0,"This was something I'd been meaning to try for a while, but only found myself willing to drop the coin on the bottle recently. It certainly does have a full flavor (to say the least)! The nose is pleasantly sweet like I would seek out in my normal favorites. Not sure I'd want to make a room smell like it, but I certainly don't mind the scent of corn and leather being the last thing I experience before I taste. The sweetness on this bottle is subdued, but very fulfilling. The Booker's ""Kentucky Chew,"" is a very high ABV (supposedly one of their, if not the, highest proof's they bottle), and if you're drinking it neat you're going to feel inch of it.

I added some water to mine on the second taste to get it down to about 90-100 proof. The flavors are still well pronounced, but there remains a pervasive burn that is especially troublesome if you catch it in the back of your throat. That said the finish is clean and I find the total flavor profile (bittersweet, clinging to the tip and center of my tongue) to be very appealing. 

Since I can get my favorite for just a little bit less strain on the wallet, I'm not sure I'll pick up another bottle any time soon- but I certainly wouldn't turn it down if offered.

Tasted neat and watered to approx 95 proof."

4.25,"3/29/20 revision- retried this back to back with stagg jr batch 12. stagg jr is almost all top end. this covered my palate with richness & better balance.  so enjoyable. upped the review to 4.25. 


original review - the review is pretty true to form. takes a lot to get the sweetness out of this one, whether adding an ice cube or water. the longer it sits on the tongue, the sweeter the profile turns. other than that, it's spicy & dark."

4.25,"Nose- Sweet tea, maple, and baking spice.
Body- Thick viscous mouthfeel. Sweet with baking spices and then the sweet tea comes in as it mellows.
Finish- Sweet tea gives way to dark chocolate. 

Note- Very easy to drink at such a high proof."
4.25,"Impressions, newer bottle, no water added: 

Strong aromas of salted caramel, peanuts, Red Hots, and acetone on the nose, which carry through on the palate, with the Red Hot notes dominating the mid-palate and finish.  The mouthfeel begins full and creamy, but quickly becomes prickly and spicy.  It stops just short of becoming astringent, finishing on an oaky diet cola note.  As expected, the finish is powerfully hot and long, but enjoyably so.   

The neck pours were a bit heavy on the peanut notes, but oxidation has brought the caramel and spice notes into better focus.  It's a bit too savory for my tastes, but it's a  very well-made and engaging dram.  It takes water well, and becomes really approachable around a 1:6 ratio. 
Update: with 1/3 bottle remaining, the cherry cola flavors have really come into focus and the bourbon shows a nice balance of sweet and tart. This one really improves over time."

4.5,"Brethren tasting on January 17, 2020"
4.25,This is delicious. This doesn’t have the really strong peanut notes that some releases have. It is sweet caramel apple with fire on the back side. A long finish with a great Kentucky hug. I am drinking this side by side with WLW at it holds its own. That is all you need to know.
4.25,"Nose is punchy with leather, peanuts, vanilla, cinnamon red hots, fennel, and black pepper. Some stone fruit showing up too, peaches and nectarines. Nice 

Honey roasted peanuts,  salted caramel, mint and sage, cinnamon on the nice finish. Lingers well, burn isn't bad but you know it's full proof. Love me some Booker's. Well done"
