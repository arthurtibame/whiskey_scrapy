5.0,"Bold, spicy, full of flavour and complexity.  This is the rye other ryes want to be. I love the bite from the higher abv. 
Buy this if you find it for a good price."

5.0,"This by far is the best Canadian Rye made. This dolly packs a punch with an incredibly high abv of 55%. 

Lot 40 Cask Strength manages to have a bold and flavorful taste which tends to be a challenge on such high abv's. 

It starts out sweet with maple, spice in the background and has a really mid-chest warmth to it. This is definitely a bottle to hold on to for quite some time."
5.0,Maple and rye spice.  Fantastic.  Best Canadian whisky I’ve tried

4.75,"Missed out on the Lot 40 year cask strength last, very happy I got my hands on a bottle this year. Bottle 3668 of 4020. Oak and spices on the nose, a big hit of black licorise on the palate followed by a long peppery and slightly bitter finish. It's very smooth for 58.4% ABV, no alcohol burn at all. Fantastic Canadian whisky, by far the best I've tried. Maybe I should pick up another bottle while I still have the chance! Cheers"

4.5,"On the nose I get strong cinnamon, maple syrup, bright flowers, fresh mown grass, green grapes, wet rye, white wine, vanilla, oak, candied orange peel, leather, and black tea with chai spices.
-
To the palate it is intense with an immediate arrival of strong, spicy rye flavours that give way to sweeter, fruitier notes of white grape juice, maple syrup, floral white wine, candied orange and cinnamon sugar.  Oak dryness appears with dark chocolate, leather, then savory butter and black peppercorns on smoked bacon.
-
In the finish there’s a warm oak flavour with light maple syrup, vanilla and chai spices.
—
With water, the nose becomes more floral, the palate become far more spicy with brighter citrus notes, and the finish has a more candied oak warmth to it.

Compared side-by-side with the 12-Year Old at 55% ABV, I find that one is richer in flavour with more oak and caramalized sweeteness, while the 11-Year is spicier and more zesty.  They’re both great!"
5.0,Big Spicy bold taste.  Syrupy and oily with a long finish.  Smooth despite high abv. Very similar to the 12 year old but unfortunately they bumped up the price.
5.0,"oh where do I start, this one has a bit of saltiness to it compared to last year's. Smell of alcohol with 11 years of old kept secrets and goes down smoothly. No complaints from the west coast except the pricing, big bump from last year price."

4.5,"This is a great pour. Bold, spicey with some balance with sweet caramel and oak. If you enjoy strong whisky, you owe it to yourself to try this out. Is it as good as the 12 year, 2017 release? Not for me. It is missing more of the deep fruit and herbal grassy note that I also like in strong Ryes."

4.25,"Look & Story: 1/1
 love the foil on the glass bottle even my wife noticed why does this one look so exciting! Especially love being able to taste cask strength canadian whiskey.
Nose: 1/1
big rye spice, sweet caramel and or burnt sugar hint of dill alot of depth
Taste: 1.5/2
big punch in the face rye and liquorice flavour luckily the liquorice flavour goes fast and gives way to fruit and caramel I rated noe simple task which is another Canadian Esqu cask strength really low because the bourbon blend was very harsh this is alot smoother and harmonius I am not a huge black licorice anise fan and that Noe simple task just gets more and more black liquorice no matter what you do :( The other flavours of caramel and burnt sugar oak and tastes amazing and lingers forever with a great finish ! It even gets more floral and sweet with water which unlike with noe simple task seems to just get worse with water overall two very interesting whiskeys to directly compare to eachother! 
Finish & Burn .75/1 
not as smooth as abundah or other cask strength scotches I have had but still drinkable dilluting it does improve the flavour imho. 
overall really interesting unique whiskey worth trying, I am glad I bought it wallet hurts at $115 cad tax in (close to abundah price one of the few cask strength whiskeys you can buy in BC) and could be tough to buy again but at limited edition I won't be able to anyways lol so  just enjoy it while it lasts."

4.75,"Among the best ryes I’ve ever had. Strong, dense, complex, yet strikingly smooth at this high proof. Classic rye palate with a lovely floral/mint on the back end. Homerun on this one"
