2.0,Very thin. Nose is very Carmel with slight dusty corn with little depth. Sweet on the front and just a slight bit bitter on the swallow. No finish. Falls away quick with not much presence of depth. Not complex. Easy to pick notes. Fair for beginners due to lack of burn and spice

3.5,"What does dry caramel smell like? That's what comes to mind. Nice color and feel.  

I get a taste that is sweet, but I still get that dry feeling. Almost like honey that has sugared on the shelf. 

The finish is quick and clean."
