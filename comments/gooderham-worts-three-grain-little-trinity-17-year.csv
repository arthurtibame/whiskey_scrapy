5.0,"Oh my - this is good stuff.  The whisky starts with a very pleasing nose.  I continued to swish the dram around and take succeeding sniffs for several minutes before actually tasting.  Very pleasing aromas that remind me of baking spices and rye bread.  The flavour was absolutely delicious - full, but also very clean, refined, and balanced.  If you like the  G&W Four-Grain offering, you'll LOVE this whisky.  The manager at the LCBO told me that he considered it the best whisky he ever had.  I think it's hard for any drink to live up to that hype, but this whisky is certainly in that conversation for me."

5.0,"This is a mature, excellent Canadian Whisky.  The nose draws you in with toasted sugars or sweet caramel balanced with light fruit and a hint of orange. Taking a sip is at first sweet, light, smooth with honey and cereal, then moves to pepper and spice. The finish is long, warm, and brings out oak, and bitter orange. This Whisky is a delight and can reveal different parts with time or paired with different items to eat. (4.5 stars)"

5.0,"The four grain but tamed, reigned in by age and experience. The finish leans over the edge of bitterness, buts hold on, leaving a desire to return for another taste. A complex blend that continues to intrigue well past the last sip."
4.0,"This has significantly more depth and richness than standard G&W. It’s smooth and sweet to start with rich caramel, vanilla, oak, rye spice notes and a hint of leather. Like standard G&W it’s held back just a bit by it’s dry, slightly bitter finish. It’s still one of, if not the best Canadian whiskies I’ve had. $80 in Ontario."

3.0,"Found this a little underwhelming, I had high hopes for this one after tasting the four grain. No real remarkable flavors, inoffensive in a way. Lets hope my bottle will improve, this was only the first dram."
4.0,"Nose: very “bourbon like”, which I like. 
Palate: soft and slightly oily with light fruit and grains.
Finish: ends too soon unfortunately and left me waiting for the punch that never comes. This is not a bad thing, I was just hoping for more “wow”. All around an excellent easy drinking Canadian whisky. If your looking for something with a bit more punch Lot 40 Cask Strength is a great choice when you can find it."
4.0,"This is the first of five limited edition Canadian whiskies released last year that I had planned to review in time for Canada Day. More than a week later, I’ve got around to only one of my samples, but it’s a cracker. The nose oscillates between the flavors of its components, one minute a rye, the next a creamy bourbon or a grain cereal. The palate starts off like a spicy rye before transitioning to creamy caramel notes. The finish wraps everything together - long, spicy, creamy, caramel. These are not shy, mellow flavors either, they pack a punch that surprises for the ABV and the age. Really good and well worth its original price of C$80. If anyone knows a more readily available bourbon that tastes like this, please point the way."

null,too much like cereal
4.0,"Easy drinking, light flavours.  Fruit, spice and rye.  Very balanced and nice, a little more punch to the flavours would be appreciated but as far as Canadian Whisky is concerned this one is definitely one of the best."

4.25,Hard to rate whether I like this or one vs this years 11 souls I think 11 souls is my fave though! This was a little more oaky I liked it on first sip! finish is maybe not as long as the other. excellent whiskey blended perfect rye almonds oak caramel! Maybe a little more buttery corn than 11 souls a little less complex than 11 so close so good :)

4.0,"Definitely improved after just one week, or maybe it's my palate :p. I'm liking my 2nd dram much more than my 1st. The nose is really Canadian, there's something unique about it, hard to discribe. I really get the rye flavors this time on the palate which id lovely. Let's see how this bottle will develop over time!"
