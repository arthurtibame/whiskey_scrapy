5.0,"Fantastic aroma and taste with lots of vanilla and caramel. What most stands out to me, though, is the mouth feel: this is a thick and chewy drink. It's almost like a syrup in the way it coats and stays in your mouth. Great."

4.0,"smooth for the strength, good spice over the vanilla, nails the bourbon fundamentals"
4.0,"overwhelming vanilla that is, in turn, overwhelmed by the alcohol burn; still, a pleasant experience"

5.0,"I was excited to see this on the menu (at Canon in Seattle), as it's a unicorn for me. Thick legs, almost syrupy. Initially very hot on the nose. But there's great depth, with spice, caramel, furniture polish, taffy, and char. A vanilla bomb. This is like finding a butterscotch factory in your grandpa's basement. On the palate, wow. Zest, a potpourri of rye spices, oak, burnt sugar, peaches, cacao nibs... the flavors cascade. Doesn't seem as hot as the proof suggests. Very rich, and balanced, not as unduly sweet or hot as other Barrell batches. Long finish. A great bourbon. Too bad these are all gone. Spectacular debut for Barrell, what a way to announce yourself. 9/13/17"

5.0,Unicorn these days. No one has the first batch. So great. Finish lasts for ten minutes.
