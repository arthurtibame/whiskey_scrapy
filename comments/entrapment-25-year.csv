2.0,"Not much flavor, usually don’t expect much from Canadian whiskey but at 25 years I expected something beyond the usual burn. 

CC is just as good at 1/25 the price to be honest"

Dec. 25
~~~~~~
‘Twas on night 25 of my new whiskey game
(Where I looked ev’ry day for a new dram to tame)
The children were nestled all snug in their beds
After spending all day bashing toys on their heads

I retired downstairs, an exhausted old elf
And I flipped on the bar lights and scoured the shelf
When what to my horrified eyes did appear
But Canadian whisky marked 25 year

My heart how it fluttered, ‘twas risky for sure
To make this Canadian whisky my pour
I recalled both the Orphan from the 24th
And the times tastes went south due to shit from the north

At the end of the day ‘twas the number that won
Though I paused and I pondered: “Could this be undone?”
But with wrapper in hand and the cork in my lap
‘Twas already too late, you see I was... entrapped.
~~~~~~
So no, not generally a big fan of Canadian whisky. But I generally am a big fan of Orphan Barrel. So I enter this drink with both a jolly optimism and a cheerfully low set of expectations.

On the nose I get honey, syrup, and fresh-cut wood. It’s pleasant, mild, and I have far fewer objections already than I did for that Rare Perfection nonsense. I will continue to call you out until one of us rots.

Body is very gentle in flavor. Nothing strikes me immediately, but over a few sips there’s honey, molasses, mint, and green tea leaves. Tastes mildly medicinal, but in a wives-tale, probably-not-real-medicine sort of way.

Finish trails off quickly with cinnamon and mint, exceedingly low heat. Mild tongue buzz. This finish reminds me so much of a cinnamon Altoid.

I’m going to file this away in the category of something well-made that doesn’t strike my fancy. For all the Canadian whisky I’ve ever tried, this bottle has done the best job straddling the line between “pleasant to drink” and “interesting flavor profile.” Unless you count my favorite Canadian whisky: Crown Royal Bourbon Mash. Which is definitely not bourbon whiskey. If you count that as Canadian, then this is a close second, and I give Orphan Barrel respect for once again delivering a quality product. In the incredibly subjective category of value/dollar, I’m 100% punting on this one. I don’t feel qualified to determine whether or not this is worth the 100 bottles or whatever of Canadian Mist you could buy with the same wad of cash. I will say that if Canadian whisky is your thing, you’d be doing yourself a disservice by not trying this whisky. 

‘Tis the season. I don’t know if I actually have 6 more new whiskeys lined up, so if you’re reading this and there’s something readily available out there you’d like me to enjoy/suffer through this holiday season, leave it in the comments. Oh, and Merry freakin Christmas!"

3.0,"Price is expensive (~$160). I would give ~100

Taste light, I call it wine in brown color. Good for people who want some easygoing stuff. Light will be its character. Strong oak smell but taste much lighter than the smell. Can taste a light touch of vanilla

In all the bottle is good but overpriced

5.0,as smooth as you would expect twenty-five-year-old Crown Royal to be I found this an excellent whiskey and think it would go excellent with a robust cigar.

3.0,"This whiskey has a pretty fancy presentation and a hefty 25 year age statement -  congrats to the kids at the ad agency for Diego in churning out yet another top shelf looking bottle and getting people to buy it at top shelf prices ($160, myself included)- but that’s unfortunately where the magic ended for me

Nose- pretty weak and hard to nail down- it’s hard to nail down because it’s uninteresting.

Palate- mouth entry is smooth, it’s a light mouth feel with a small amount of spice. The tasting notes are pretty basic- it reminds me a little of a watered down blade and bow. 

Finish- smooth, tastes light - light like it’s been forgotten in a barrel a few years too many- IMO only malted barley (Scotch) holds up over 23 years in the barrel - rye and corn based spirits start to fall apart in a bad way after that time. 

If you want a blended whiskey that performs with smoothness and taste at a FRACTION of the cost - go with POWERS, that stuff is an amazing value. Don’t tell anyone; like I’m doing ... right... now. We all know how whiskey companies are pining over any opportunity to execute price hikes these days. Enjoy!"

4.0,"Prefer with a drop of water to open. 

Very light, mild whisky (Canadian) - especially before opening. A drop of water brings out a much bolder flavor profile that a bourbon lover like myself probably prefers while still remaining very smooth to drink. 

A bit pricey at ~$130. But what do you want for 25 year aged whisky?"
