4.75,"The color is a very dark and rich amber and with any movement of the glass it becomes completely coated in heavy, never ending legs. Stitzel-Weller was known for using barrels that had thicker staves than usual so that more whiskey would permeate into the wood, and perhaps this is what gives such a dark color despite being only 6 years old. The nose is very oaky but not over powering, while at the same time very buttery along with the perfect amount of vanilla. A touch of baking spices comes out along with the faintest hint of cherry. The palate is rich and slightly oily, with the oak filling the mouth while the butteriness carries through for a wonderful mouthfeel. Vanilla and touches of baking spices follow, making this seem almost like a rich dessert. The finish is medium with lingering oak and a bit of cinnamon, while the rest of palate fades away together with a very creamy finish. Truly a great bourbon, held back only by the flavors being a bit too gentle which sadly cut the finish too short."
