4.0,"This single barrel release from 2016 was finished in ex-White Port barrels from the Carcavelos region of Portugal after 12 years in ex-bourbon casks. Teeling claims this finish was a first for any whiskey and it sets a great precedent. It’s sweet and spicy, with notes of hot peppers and an aftertaste of white grapes."
