4.0,Great Indiana bourbon! Live about 20 minutes away from the distillery. These guys are passionate about what they make.
3.25,"Very wheat heavy flavor. Unfortunately I’m not a huge wheat guy. Nice subtle flavors of caramel and vanilla, but subtle."

3.5,Spicy kick but might prefer as a mixer
0.5,"There might be bourbon here, but you won't be tasting it. This hits like they poured a cup of sugar into each bottle, and it has ruined what is left. Possibly the worst tasting ""bourbon"" I have had, because it really does not taste like one."

4.25,Smooth. Smokey. Sweet. Reminds me of scotch.
4.0,"Smell is quite pleasant with sweet vanilla, oak, some fruit.  Definitely get a lot of oak taste.  Not a lot of tingle, very smooth.  Finish is strong, but does not linger long."
