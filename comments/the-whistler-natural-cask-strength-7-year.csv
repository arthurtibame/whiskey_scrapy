4.25,"First pours were just amazing. I cant wait to see how it opens up.
On the nose,  immediate warm brown sugar and little to no phenolic smells at all. Very surprising with the 59%abv I could smell this for days. After first sip the lightest hint of fruit comes through. 
Proofed down, a pepper note covers the brown sugar and seems to just make it a brighter nose all together.

On the palate, a slightly sweet deep wood note that is followed by a now creamy brown sugar maltyness (reminiscent of the butter note pot still Irish has) and finishes with a very inviting hot heat instead of a spicy heat which I was anticipating. The high abv shows itself in the end of the finish with phenol taste residing in the throat. Palate doesn’t change too much on second sip, you’re just more ready for the woody goodness. So tasty and heartwarming I don’t want to add water lol but for science I must.
After proofing down, it starts with a bold creamy feel with the wood notes expressing themselves more individually but residing in the cream. The hot finish has subsided and a soft creamy brown sugar warms the back of the throat.

Phenomenal whisky. Dangerously tasty."
