1.5,"Nose: perfume, floral, slightly bright, alcohol vapors, sharp grain, some sweetness but like a very light spun sugary candy- almost sticky, alcohol will push aside if left to sit, hint of fruitier sweetness comes out and becomes more tame, honey notes. Taste: sweet, sharp barrel spice, lingers hot, not much else. You can tell it uses a lot of grain vs malt. Not that great neat. Mix this one."

2.0,Basically just a thinner version of Kakubin with less flavor. Might do better in cocktails but not really necessary with Kaku at the same price.
