Honestly, if they had a big cute teddy bear on the label the FDA would come guns blazing and charge them with selling to minors. In fact, your 14 year old daughter is probably already drinking this."

And mixed into cocktails is amazing. I prefer this over their BSB 60 proof version. My wife likes the 60 proof version, this 103 proof version is my ""go to"" now. A definite must try, even for the most discerning whiskey fan. Perfect to pass around the tailgates this football season."

2.25,"I have mixed emotions about this. If you enjoy drinking pancake syrup straight from the bottle, this might be for you. If you are trying to learn to enjoy bourbon, this may be a good way to start. It does not have a bad taste, just way too sweet for what I think a typical bourbon should taste like. As a matter of fact, you would have to extract some sugar from this to make an old fashioned. This will be a mixer for me. Might be good in an ice cream shake."

2.0,"Just as the name would imply, the nose is full of brown sugar, cinnamon, and a bit of alcohol heat. The palate is even more sweet than you would expect, and the brown sugar is overpowering. There’s something kinda funky in the aftertaste, but I can’t quite figure out what that is. Overall, I can’t be mad at it, because it tastes exactly like it says it does. At the same time, this has almost no resemblance to whiskey, and might actually benefit from less of the sugary flavor."
2.5,"Like making pancakes in the zombiepocalypse, it just doesn't taste as it should. There's just something off ..the maple syrup, old butter, bloody finger, pancake mix, or the screams of your dying friends trying to protect you while making breakfast.

Smells maple and alcohol singe.
Tastes like viscous cinnamon syrup.

More enjoyable than fireball/cinnerator/etc."

2.5,I dont drink much flavored whiskey but the strength here is much better than the 60 proof BSB. Would be great in cocktails.
