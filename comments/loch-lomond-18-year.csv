3.75,"Well the 12 yr kicks some imo so thought this would be 6 yrs better. Not exactly. The profile is the same with the exotic fruits, autumn leaves and malty woods( please see 12 yr review). This takes all the rich bold vibrancy of the flavor and matures and flattens it out . Still has nice depth but the fruits are dried now and the casks are old. Finish is fading dry fruit and malt with parched wood. Its a bit tannic but lasts and is pleasant enough. On its own its still very good scotch but at the price($79) it falls a little short....88/100.....I know this sounds like a high score given my review but its still good I just expected more from age/price...... doubt I would repurchase though if Im being honest as the 12yr is quite good for less than half the $$"
4.0,"Some big dried fruit flavor, a little spice, but a full flavor."
3.5,"Smooth and silky, medium peat with a light leathery smokiness. The semi - bold beginning dissipates quickly and leaves a pleasantly light cigar finish."
4.25,"Nose: big butter and something more sugary than a vanilla sweetness. A whiff of book pages.

Intro: white pepper and mild peat smoke. A semi-dry medium bodied mouthfeel. A touch of effervescence yet no tart notes or excess salinity.

Mid: subdued dried fruits and clover honey with peat smoke turning ashy 

Finish: lingering plum wine, juicy golden raisins, and a botanical bouquet building over seconds into minutes. Almost a gin sensation and more similar to crushing mid-American juniper berries in hand with the sweet sap bark and berry smells. 

Overall: Very relaxing and mild with more than enough revelation for an experienced taster to enjoy in a beautifully simple way but to also introduce new whisky drinkers to a dose of complexity, peat, and ample amount of woodspices.

As for imagery the dram conjures: she must be The Fair Maiden - youthful in spirit, a mixture of innocence and experience. A warm countenance. Flowers in her hair.  Does she fancy you? Do you fancy her?"

4.0,"Hay, malted cereal, dried fruit and hint of smoke on the nose. The palate is somewhat sweet, with some honey and toffee notes there. The finish is dry, oaky and of medium length. Pretty good stuff."
4.0,"What a peculiar marriage of flavors... and so well-crafted and put together. Delicious! Maybe I'm crazy, but the combination of dates, rubber, peated barley and oak make for a whisky I'm really enjoying. Having said all that, I can recognize that this expression is quite polarizing. It's like sushi, you either love it or hate it."
2.0,"Loch Lomond 18....Cask used is oak... quite non descriptive. Started off not to bad, but then got a hit of acetone, almost bitter grapefruit. There is more there but difficult to get past. Musty oak. Well it's cheap for an 18 year old at $75 USD. Not for sale in nz but that's not issue as I wouldn't buy a bottle. Initial sip I thought maybe a 4 but then as the acetone hit and santised my taste buds and as I got further into it it went down down down. 3, 2.5, and then finally when I poured it down the sink instead of my throat a 2. An unbalanced dram if ever there was one. As I felt sorry for inflicting it upon my poor tongue I treated it to a Laga 16 which immediately made it feel better :-). I looked on the internet after and there are 46% and 43% versions which maybe different? Mine was the 43% not the 46 reviewed by distiller."

5.0,"Had during Whiskey Guild's Whiskey Cruise 2016...after having a slew of drams already.  This being one of the last I tasted, it was quite amazing.  If I ever get myself a bottle I'll be able to write something proper..."

3.25,"Definitely the best of the three Loch Lomond I have tried: classic, 12 and this 18. It seems time and an oak coat do this malt a world of good.

Nose:
Enjoyably complex
musky farm animal note
dark dried fruit
Old book pages
A little milk chocolate
Dust
Saddle Leather with the horse still there
Pine O’clean (disinfectant)
Dry Roast beef salty

Arrival:
Nicely viscous 
Creamy and buttery
dried fruit
Dark muskovado sugar

Development:
Bright barley shines through
There’s a bit of an American rye vibe
Dark Salted caramel

Finish:
Sweet oily and sugary
Black pepper
Meaty smoke
Dry sushi sheet seaweed

There’s plenty here to be happy with but the overall quality still holds it back from competing with many other 18yo. For the price it’s worth getting a bottle."
3.25,Salil says taste like scotch!
3.5,Almost a rye spice up front. Tiny bit of smoke on the back. Little fruity. Nice.

3.5,"Nose is some darker fruit with lots of vanilla.  Taste is darker than expected with less bread and light fruit, more dried cherry up front, vanilla and Walnut, and a dried apricots on the finish with some smoke.  The smoke is fairly light, just adding a bit of character."

2.25,"Nose: Wet mossy wood, salt and light pepper, sea air, spicy cheese (parmesan?)

Palate: immediate bitterness and spice, sandalwood, slightly stronger salt and pepper, slight vinegar, very little black licorice

Finish: Bitter finish with dryer oak"

3.25,Raising slightly as the bottle open up. Its soso. Not very memorable but very drinkable. Just not much there to make me buy another bottle!
3.5,"Peat smoke and orange peel or marmalade in the nose, sweet on the palette, with a bit of dried apricot and milk chocolate, gentle smoke in the relatively short finish. 3 cl sample from the 12 Drams of Christmas Premium (2019 Edition)."
3.0,Tasting @  9 weeks after being opened at just below neck pour.  Very smooth @ 92 proof. Mild flavors OK flavors but not to impressed and especially for 18 years. Won't be buying again.
3.75,"Nose: Cherry pie, candied pecans, hint of campfire smoke
Palate: Very smooth.  Light peat, with grilled pineapple, cinnamon, allspice."

3.25,I’m not a huge peat fan and this scotch has plenty. Smokey though out. Still quite smooth. Slight sweetness up front. I prefer it well chilled.
