2.5,Taste wise... it’s not good. But points for creativity and a cool looking bottle. It’s super unique. I didn’t hate it as much as most of the people on here.
0.25,"Friend gave me a taste of this as a gag, and an excuse to get rid of some of his bottle.

nose - I can't even start to explain it. It starts out like a young immature bourbon but then turns to down right rancid and putrid notes.

taste - so figure rule is you HAVE to hold your nose on this one. You simply cannot force yourself to drink it if you can smell it, yes it smells that bad. OK so it opens up actually pretty sweet, I almost like it up front. It then sadly like the nose goes into these off putting chemical like notes. Weird malted flavors. While not a complete disaster, it's down right horrible over all.

I'd give it a 1 star on the taste, it's drinkable. The nose however is so bad, you have to hold your breath to be around it. 

This is a classic rot gut gag whisky and should only be purchased as a joke to play on friends."
0.25,It’s not good.  I have purchased another bottle of toilet bowl cleaner.
1.5,"Strange on the nose...not a good taste, OK finish.  I’ve obviously had better, and rarely worse.  This will be the only bottle I ever buy."
3.75,"Aged at least 2 Years.  Light on the nose.  Not much change or complexity as it opens.  Not flawed, but needs more aging.  My score was 78.5"
3.5,Soft Dusty corn nose with a bright and spicy palate. The finish spicy and short lived for me. Youthful tasting but very unique. This will be incredible with a little more age.

2.0,"Really harsh on the palate, burns for days. Interesting, but way too spicy."
0.25,This is definitely the worst “bourbon” I have ever had! Better to call it bad moonshine. I bought the bottle thinking a craft distiller would be cool to try out but had to throw out the bottle after only a few drams. I even tried to share it with a few bourbon buddies..who wouldn’t take more than a sip of it before spitting it out. Don’t waste your time or tongue on this!

2.0,"This bourbon is a light copper color with very thin very viscous legs.

The nose is young. It has notes of astringency, corn dust, wildflowers, and vanilla.

The palate is young and harsh. Notes of burnt caramel, cheap vanilla frosting, NGS, and pine sap and fight for attention though none should be the leading lady.

The finish is hot at first then dives into a short anticlimax.

It’s a shame because everything about this bourbon seemed to bespeak excellence! A straight bourbon from Kentucky, a four grain mash bill, even the unique bottle was beautiful! However, this bourbon was a disappointment, I don’t recommend it. Sorry Jeptha Creed. Try again. Cheers!"

0.25,Just awful.  Very harsh.  Nothing good to say about it other than it has a very attractive bottle.
2.75,"On the nose, mint, almost a mixture of spearmint with peppermint. Tastes sharp, some sweetness through the middle (brown sugar maybe?) with a good burn throughout. Not long finishing, aftertaste of mint. Overall not bad for a newer distillery and their bourbon."
