3.5,This was the moonshine aged in virgin American white oak. Interestingly not ex bourbon casks but virgin oak like bourbon. Again with corn it's almost like a bourbon product in the base inputs but not output i.e. taste.  They did say they distilled 20 times up to 90%. Again interesting as I thought 3 to 4 times was the limit for whiskey. It's almost vodka like in this aspect. I got vanilla coming through. It was nice but I think weirdly I preferred the Moonshine spirit.
