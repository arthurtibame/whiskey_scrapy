Rolled the dice and tried something new. Quite pleasant on the nose but a little harsh on the taste buds. Very dry smokiness with the slightest honey & toffee. Not unpleasant to drink but one you’d pull out to share with your less knowledgeable companions 😜🥃"
3.25,"Thought I'd go on a limb and try something new. I am way behind on writing old reviews, but I will catch up when I can... 

This one is nothing like a typical speyside, and has an interesting nose - peat up front, but met with vegetal notes like green beans, little sauerkraut, twangy lemons/oranges, medium florals, subtle sweetness, but no smoke.

The palate brings a thin to medium mouth coat. Wow though, much better than anticipated. Now a get a little smoke and waxiness, caramel, butterscotch, shortbread cookies. Sadly, no fruit, but there is vanilla, and a touch of white pepper. 

As far as a finish, that's where we quickly die.  At bit abrupt, other than a nice warm waxy buttery tone.  Very dry for my taste... At least nothing was off putting, or bitter/mineral. Not a bad dram though as a basic peated daily sipper. 

This is at 40% ABV, but let's do a drop of water and see if we get any reaction... For the nose, it brings the fruits forward and tames the peat. The palate is similar, with maybe a bit of a barbecue note, but kills the smoke. Finish brings more white pepper, but just as dry and short.

Well, this is slightly better than average, but only $35 bucks plus a little to ship. Not something I might buy again per se, but I think it's a great one night stand. Ah! The theme to this dram is ""One Night Stands"" by Bocephus, Hank Jr.  It's an ok intro to a little peat for some, and not an Islay, but has a decent taste.  3.25 of 5."
