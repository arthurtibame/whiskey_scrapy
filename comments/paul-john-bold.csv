4.0,"Nice sweet & savory nose with stone fruits, kumquat skins, spices and a hint of peat and smoke. Silky on the palate with sweet stone fruits, spices and peat. The finish is spicy and medium length with some of the sweet & savory notes. 
Not a bad choice at all for first foray into Indian whisky."
4.25,"Indian WHisky...When i first started this ""hobbie"" i would have never thought i will be drinking Indian Whisky, And this, is my second one. (The other was amrut)

Bottled at 46%abv; pale straw color.

I happened to meet the brand ambassador of Paul John indian whisky in whisky live and he was the typical Hindu guy just like great tiger from NES (that is a ""punchout"" videogame reference, and if you didn't knew it, your childhood was not as good as mine).

On the nose is incredible. The ""BOLD"" Expression is the heavily peated one. So Peat, orange, honey, and some spice... wait... is that...CURRY? (Typical Indian Food). Amazing.

On the palate it gets a little more ""normal"" with a very spicy mouth bomb, very hot and oaky, the term ""bold"" fits perfectly. 

The finish is medium and full of spices, wasabi and pepper, but much more controled.

Overall i give this very interesting dram an 88 over 100 and if you find it, taste it. It is an experience."
3.5,This is my “daily sipper nominee of the Paul John core lineup. Aroma reminds me of Laphroaig but lighter and sweeter with more grilled orchard fruit; Palate tips towards chestnut with the roasted notes with bits of copper arriving as it opens; Finish hits all the right notes as it slowly fades out.
2.5,"Scharf rauchig, Abgang nicht lange."
4.25,Really like this. Same flavor as the edited with more peat. Couldn’t have too much still given how sweet these are.
4.0,Great as it opens up.

3.75,"Nose: not bonfire or bandaid like usual peat, instead more like smoked bacon, but it has a sweet butterscotch to it as well. End notes slightly spiked with a pepper and citrus.

Palate: very surprising. Only light smoke, instead it explodes in a sea of butterscotch sweetness that's followed by flowery citrus spice. The finish carries some of the oak and the smoked bacon, still with some malt sweetness."

3.5,oily lingering taste. harsh
3.0,It tastes great on the first part of the sip but it has an aftertaste which took away from the sweetness of the first part.

4.0,Number 4 on the Paul John journey. Was disappointed with the Edited and Classic. This is a big step up. Lovely sweetness marries off against the peat and lovely creaminess carries the flavour. Not to sure if a 3 or 4. Perhaps 3.5 but will round up for now. Have to reassess sometime against an islay. After moving onto the peated 55% and sherry cask 60% I was graciously allowed another generous drop of this. Still held its own very nicely despite the lower abv. Whilst I don't hold Jim Murray's ratings in much regard I do see why he gave this a liquid gold and it's a top award winner for them.  The only one of the range I'll def buy a bottle of
