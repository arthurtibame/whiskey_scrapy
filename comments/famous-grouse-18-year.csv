4.25,"The Time Machine: This was no longer sold/bottled sometime before 2011. I have read 2005-2007 but the code on my bottle looks like 2008 or 2011, maybe different for the US market. It is a rare and great find. No one knows what this is so they ignore it and it sits on shelves. What is it? It is an Edrington product. A mixture of Macallan, Highland Park and probably Glenturret and/or Glenrothes to fill it out. This is Macallan made at the end of their golden age, with pre-1994 Golden Promise barley, aged in great sherry casks. It is Highland Park and Macallan before they became super popular and had a run on their stocks and had to resort to NAS whisky... it is like taking a time machine back 9-12 years and tasting these great whiskys at the near peak of their quality. 18 year old Macallan and Highland Park (and Glenturret and Glenrothes) distilled some 30 years ago!!! SEEK. THIS. OUT.

Nose: Sherry sweetness, fruity, malty, no sulphur. Fantastic smell.

Palate: Mild sherry on the tongue, little bit of oak spice, peppery and ends in mild smoke (HP). Very refined and silky on the tongue. Nice hint of malt.

Finish: Good length but not overly long. Dissolves into peppery smoke and a little drying.

This is one of the easiest drinking scotches I have ever tasted and makes me wish I was a whisky drinker back in the days of the Whisky Loch(Lake) and the abundance of great, inexpensive single malt scotch. I have 2019 Macallan 18 fine oak and this is much better. There is still great stuff out there but this is like a ghost from the past that reminds you of what has been lost. I can keep visiting this wonderful time of great whisky until the bottle goes empty which won't be very long I am afraid... slàinte."
