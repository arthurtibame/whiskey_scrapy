4.75,"Amazing. Currently my favourite peaty whiskey. Was introduced to whiskey by Ardbeg, like many. 
On the nose: Smokey with a sweet undertone. As it settles becomes more like a burnt caramel. 
On the palette: after the peaty tasted,notes of a vanilla honey with sea spray."

4.25,"Add water

Nose: campfire, briny, medicine, peat, smoke, seaweed, salt, iodine.
Palate: sweetness, honey appears first then the peat and smoke, very intense but mouth watery 
Finish: long and warm, the sweetness lingers"

4.5,"Great Smokey vegetal sweetness with dried dark fruits on the nose.  A very slight Sherry smell. Medicinal and peat notes aren't overpowering like an Ardbeg. Wonderful sweet vanilla, leather, and dried fruit (dried apples as well) come through on the pallette initially. Medicinal notes are there but not persistent.  Smoke changes to more of a mix of toasty oak and mesquite. Smoke persist in a long oily finish but with a lemon or grapefruit zest and a little zing of spice. I'm a rye and bourbon drinker and this is amazing. Don't expect it to be a winner initially but grows on you after several tastings over weeks. Note: pair with milk chocolate and chopped bacon for a next level experience!"
