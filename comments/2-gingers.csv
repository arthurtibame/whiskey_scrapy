2.0,"Dry in flavor, has a tart finish that lingers on the pallate."
2.0,More like a 2.5. Has an ether off taste hidden by honey. Not the best to come from kilbeggan. Bit of spice and cask.

3.0,"This is a very fine whiskey for a low cost. Goes down smooth neat and also mixes well with club soda and ice. Slightly sweet and very mild. It was $16 when I found it last year, now around $22.  It has replaced Jameson as my day-to-day Irish whiskey."

2.0,"Good mixer, but one-dimensional as a sipper."
4.0,"Golden brown in color, it’s very likely that caramel color has been added to 2 Gingers so that it doesn’t look young and pale. The nose on 2 Gingers is a nice combination of fruits with apple, pear, and lemon combining with apricot and peach. Behind that are some pleasant sweet notes including caramel, vanilla, and honey, backed with a slight ginger spice. The entry for 2 Gingers is light and sweet featuring honey, caramel, malted barley, and green apple. Things transition quickly in the midpalate where 2 Gingers picks up some spice with black pepper, allspice, ginger, and a touch of eucalyptus. From there things get a little tart and acidic with the green apple re-emerging and combining with sour lemon for a fairly acidic and hot finish. The finish is of medium length, dry, and a little hot."

3.0,"The second 50ml sample of the evening was generously supplied by a friend as part of a surprise Christmas gift.  This Irish whisky is only available in a few states in the upper mid-West:  2 Gingers.  It also comes in the standard 80 proof and is a clear, straw yellow in color.  Like most Irish whiskies it also appears to be very light.

The nose pops with a lively citrus and honey mixture.  There's a faint bit of oak if you really inhale it deeply, but it's very light.  On the palate it's a a tad sweet and malty.  There's nothing that jumps out at you through the entire sip.  A bit of a slight burn from the oak washes it away rather cleanly.  The finish is medium in length, warm but non-offending.

There's nothing outstanding about it when drinking it neat, but I could see it adding a bit of citrus to any mixed cocktail you choose to add it to.  I don't really drink mixed drinks using whiskey so I don't see myself needing a full bottle, but it was nice to review it neat and add it to my review catalog.  Cheers and thanks to Paul for the awesome Christmas gift."

4.0,"Enters gently on the nose with malted, and almost toasted, barley notes as well as a little tart frutiness. Also, picking up hints reminiscent of a lightly peated scotch and grain/hay. Sits light on the palette. No burn, but a subtle warmth in the back of the throat along with notes of creamy barley. Finishes with an almost woodsy vanilla with latent spiciness. An excellent choice for the price."
4.0,"Sweet, vanilla, not hot at all, comforting, and buttery. Light spiciness of ginger. Kinda similar to Glen Mornagie, though I don't get the fruitiness GM has. Maybe a hint of smoke?"
4.0,"Tart fruit on the nose for this fella; Granny Smith apples, white grapes, and shades of maltiness. More fruit on the palate, accompaned by cereal grains and the flavor and texture of warm honey. Finished with a creamy citric bite and a spiciness reminiscent of well... ginger. There. I said it.

Not the most compex dram in the world. But for $20, this is just right."

3.0,"This is my favorite in the $20 Irish price range. The nose has tart white winegrapes and sweet lemon pie, along with a touch of ethanol. It's got a very gentle body, too- caramelized pears, apples, and a touch of the characteristic copper. Higher proof would serve very well. Finishes short with mild dryness on the tongue. It's simple and pretty good, with more character than the competition. Albeit, not by too much."

2.0,"The price was right to give this a try. Neat, I found the finish to be off-putting. The sourness is not often experienced in an Irish. 

I usually enjoy my whiskey neat or with a bit of ice, but will sometimes drink whiskey with Ginger Ale like me dear Granddad did. I found 2 Gingers was NOT a good companion, and mixing actually intensified the sour after taste.

For the sake of experimentation, I muddled 5 blueberries in with the same amount of whiskey and Ginger Ale, and that yielded a pleasant cocktail."

3.0,"Appearance: This Irish offering has a light straw gold color. And thick semi-watery legs make their journey back down the glass.

Nose: The nose first hits with a “grainy” nose more typical of blended Irish whiskies, but overall, sweet and full is the impression. Notes of sweet honey, lemon candy, milk chocolate malt balls, snickerdoodle cookies, red apples, and orange / cantaloupe parade across one’s nasal cavity.

Taste: On the palate the impression is also fruity and full with notes of orange, cherry, cinnamon, strawberry Twizzler candy, shortbread cookies, black tea with lemon, and red grapes. 

Finish: The finish is lingering with a Tannin-y and lemon rind flourish at the end.

Thoughts: Hey, for a budget Irish whiskey, this was not bad at all! It was complex, tasty, I liked it better after letting it open up a bit, but dang, for less than $25.00, I’ll recommend it! Thanks to both of you Gingers! Sláinte!"

3.75,"Found it for $15 and had to give it a try. I was very pleasantly surprised. Typical sweet caramel and vanilla for an Irish . Possibly a bit more spicy than some other Irish whiskeys. Definitely a lot more vanilla. I’d be interested to try with a coke, might make it a bit root beer-esque with all the vanilla. Overall great for the price. If you like Irish whiskey it won’t disappoint. I will say it has a bit of a sour aftertaste, so drink with caution, it will keep you sipping"

2.75,"2 Gingers aint bad. Great with a cooler beer, makes a good flask whisky or a mixer. It’s super light and sweet, not much malt or pot still in the blend, but it’s also $15 out the door. After you’ve had enough of the good stuff and can’t tell anyway, this is the bottle you wanna find empty after doing shots at 4am! Not your Balvenie or Redbreast!"
