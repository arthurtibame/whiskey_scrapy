4.0,"This takes some getting used to it.  Just when you think you're going to have a gentle honey heather Speysider, it then comes at you in a totally different guise.  Thanks to Richard, I got to try this twist on Balvenie.  Tasted blind, I could've sworn I was having a Yoichi 10.  The peat isn't anything like an Islay or even Islander, it's missing the briny or medicinal depth that they provide.  The closest I can think of is Yoichi.  Unlike a regular Balvenie, which is for everybody, I don't think this would appeal to all.  The Islay lovers going in expecting the Laphroaig medicinal or Ardbeg tar type peat will be disappointed.  The Islanders loving the salty peat will be disappointed. But if you like the Yoichi style---yes---then you'll appreciate this unique twist.  That peat is earthier, muddier, more mushroom-y.  Try it...if you don't like it, at least you'd have experienced a unique Balvenie, one that comes at you with some chest hair.  Thanks Richard!  Personally, I think I'm going to see if I can buy a bottle"

4.0,"A Balvenie with balls was what I was hoping for when this was announced, and it doesn't disappoint. As much as I enjoy a smooth honeyed Balvenie, it's not the most challenging of Scotches. But add a dash of peat and you get a slightly dangerous twist, a Speyside take on emo Peter Parker*. There's honey and spice on the nose, and it's there too on the palette. The peat isn't Ardbegian, rather it's a dash of pepper in a fresh, creamy, smooth mouthful. The finish is long and peppery, with hints of orange and caramel. A real treat amid the gallons of NASty Duty Free swill.

4.5,"Delicious and great value.

Honey, melon and peat on the nose with floral hints. Palate is predominantly lemon and wood spices, with an oily texture to the mouth. @PBMichiganWolverine and @Camardicus are also spot on with a peculiar yet pleasant note: mushrooms. The finish is a little harsh, with a lingering baking spice ending."

4.5,"Picked this up for $143, non chill filtered, >46% alcohol, 14 year age statement and the packaging provides a great depth of information for novice to advanced afficiandos. Does well neat and with a few drops of water (body reduces). Vanilla, caramel, smoke that is different from islay whisky peers. This highland whisky is a top winner on the travel retail market due to price and quality of dram. Solid job @balvenie #balvenie."

3.75,"Dry, smoky and lean despite being 48% ABV."
3.5,"The oloroso sherry influence really shines in the nose, nutty, dried apricots, cloves with earthy peat appearing towards the end. On the palate, that earthy peat, much more prominent now, balanced out by raisins, dried apricots and red apples, honey, nutmeg and a lovely heat. A medium length, oily finish, warm and inviting, a dash of honey and savoury as the heat fades away."
4.0,Very good. Less peaty than week of peat and a little more spicy.

4.0,"This is an interesting scotch. I can’t say it is my favorite Balvenie, and far from being a typical offering from the speyside mainstay (as it’s peated). I love the abv, the Balvenie peat (which they should consider doing more than a week a year), and the complexity imparted by the different casks. 

What holds this rating back a little is that I don’t get the characteristic Balvenie thick and savory mouthfeel. It’s a little thin. And the finish a bit short, although the sherry kicks in a little at the end. Overall a solid expression but I probably wouldn’t buy another bottle at that price point."

4.5,"The peat is evident immediately. Would never guess this is Balvenie in a blind tasting. But then the honeylike sweetness comes through. Dark raisins. Some hints of orange peel. Really nice layered whisky. Also spicy on the back of the palate. Peppery. More peat, warm and very long finish. Perfect late night sipping dram!"
4.0,Smoky yet sweet
