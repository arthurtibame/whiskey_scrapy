5.0,"When a North American describes a whisky as sweet, I tend to be doubtful... Bitter, lemony and a little but sweet, spicy, toasty, chocolaty, molasses, herbs... A lot of flavours coming out fast. The whisky is volatile from the cold and hot temperatures it has come up against during ageing, from the sweet corn against the rye, from the bourbon cask against the soft rum, not to mention the malted barley.
      As such the whisky is not exactly harmonious and elegant, but rather dashing and vivacious, something quite unique. You may wonder how all these flavours work together... honestly I don't know either, but they do!!"

3.0,"The nose is light, sweet. On first sip I picked up brown sugar or caramel quickly. Nicely balanced with the splash of some rye. Not too peppery though. Perhaps some dark fruits,but very little.  I was surprised by the smooth feel. The nose was leaning toward boozy, but there was no burn in the sip, nor the finish. The finish was a bit short and I was left again with the sugary notes. A good desert whisky."

4.0,"On the nose, there's vanilla and raisins. The rum notes are very present and could fool you if you didn't know it was scotch.
On the mouth, it continues with more if the same, with layers of spice, caramel, and a pleasant medium finish.
Un bon rapport qualité/prix.

3.0,2.75. Corn/rye ratio maybe a bit too much for me. Pretty sweet but also perhaps over compensated by the spice & oak as it carries very dark/bitter quality. Getting the rum note on the nose more so than the palette but it's there.

4.5,"What a tasty treat for not that much treasure! I continue to be surprised by Canadian whisky and all the lovely flavors (that easily stand up against my favorite scotches in a different but equal way) and the incredibly accessible price point most of them are at. 

I like rum. I like it in cocktails. I like it neat. I’m particularly fond of the Eldorado 15 year, which is like drinking liquid Nutella (also makes a damn fine hot buttered rum!). Immediately on the nose of this whisky you’re greeted by vanilla, demura sugar, but none of that rummy funk. On the taste, those rum notes are definitely there but it doesn’t overpower the whisky, which shows up more in the finish with that trademark Canadian smoothness. 

A return sip still leads with the rum finish on the nose and palate, but you get a little more of the whisky flavors the second go around. The finish is long and slow, and takes you through a symphony of rummy goodness and whisky warming. A very fine pairing, and I’m tacking on a few extra points for the completely unreasonable and low price of $28 USD. You’d pay over three times that for a rum finished scotch or Irish with less of the savory results. Grab this when you can!"
2.5,Maybe this was a victim of unrealistic high expectations from reviews but I came away disappointed... which is rare for me when it comes to whiskey. The rum influence overtakes everything!!! [sad face]. Maybe some time in the opened bottle might do it some good but I’m not holding out much hope. Sucks I bought an extra bottle before I tried it [sadder face] Best case scenario for me at this point is using a tiny splash in my growing infinity bottle(s).
2.0,"Sadly there's nothing there... just a weak rum taste.  It's almost as if you get no benefits of a good rye and no benefits of a good rum.  

I think, ultimately, the low proof kills it.  The average person might call it ""smooth"" but I call it ""a waste."""

5.0,"This is one of my favorite ""cheap"" whiskey's that I can buy locally in Ohio. I think that I like it so much is because they finish it in Rum barrels and Rum is my generally my go to mixer. Though, Gin has worked its way up the list on things that I start with. My synopsis is, if you like burnt or ""blackened"" whiskey this may not be for you as its threshold is a sweet and smooth on the palate. I've given this as a gift many times and it is generally well received."

3.0,"Strong nose of alcohol, rum; yes 42% ABV. Mellow sweet mouth, doesn't burn inside at all, almost maple syrup. A bit dry and a bit bitter but mouthful finish, not watery at all; I don't like watery finish. Then the punch of rum in the aftertaste; didn't go to head at all, I was expecting that from 42%. Rum notes are intense though particularly in the nose and aftertaste. Overall, it's gentle and smooth. I am not a big fond of rum though(apart from Bacardi White Rum). 
This bottle would last for a length of time.

This is my first take on Whiskey, I am a dry wine person. Please excuse if it feels too much."

2.25,A bit too much maple and vanilla for my taste.
2.25,"Solidly forgettable, inoffensive whisky with the usual characteristics and body of rum finishing: light, thin, sweet.  Sweet in a straight, sugar sweetness kind of way.  None of the deep fruit sweetness notes associated with better finishes (Port and, to a lesser extent, sherry).  Vanilla in the way rum often reminds you of vanilla.  Lacks the deep oak or wood notes you would want from something carryng a 10-year age statement.  A fleck of pepper in the finish.

Smells like watered down bourbon but tastes like 50/50 scotch and rum.

I can't decide if this is worth the $27 cost of admission.  I'm going to say no.  I've had better $15 bourbon."

En bouche, l'entrée est typique des whisky canadiens, beaucoup de saveurs caramélisées mais aussi la canne à sucre et l'eau d'érable qui s'ajoutent, légère présence épicée par le seigle mais sans plus, quelques petits fruits mielleux. Finale au goût boisé et sec, quelques restants de canne à sucre grillée. Texture correcte mais qui perd de son charme vers la fin. Je ne comprends pas trop les évaluations qui disent que c'est trop sucré alors qu'on a un produit fini en fut de rhum... Fallait s'y attendre et j'aime bien"

Palate redeems the offensive nose with maple syrup, that thin sweetness that rum has and finally a healthy dose of vanilla. Has a nice spice at the finish. I like to find some fruity notes in my whiskey but this doesn't have any. 

Finish is medium with spice and ethanol. 

Overall it's not bad. It would make a good gift for someone who thinks the only canadian whiskey out there is Crown Royal. I think it's a cut above Crown as far as sipping but its not worth much mixing."
