4.75,"Batch 13- 9 Year Old

Nose- caramelized banana, lemons, cherries, dark caramel, vanilla, espresso beans

Palate- Spiced oak initially, wave of honey sweetness, lemon oil, baking spices, caramel, espresso

Finish- Long, mouth coating finish with notes of baking spices, caramel, and espresso 


Mmm. Great stuff. You can taste the age right off the bat. Unique flavors of espresso from the nose to the finish. The best way to describe this is dark and thick. I would order this at a bar any day if I saw it, but for the price point, I would rather pay just a bit more for Birthday Bourbon. Regardless, a fantastic pour that you should share with other bourbon lovers."
4.5,"Sweet Carmel on the nose. With a little burn. 
On the taste it starts off a little hot then quickly mellows with a vanilla or burnt sugar/creme brûlée taste. 
Finishes with a slight hug and some dark chocolate and dark fruit with more vanilla lingering."
4.0,Oaky in spades. Slightly medicinal upfront as well. Well balanced and delicious. Worth a try for certain!
4.0,"Nose is sweet and complex. Slightly medicinal note to it. Full body, very little burn that lingers just the right amount of time. A little bit of spice on the back end and an oaky finish"
