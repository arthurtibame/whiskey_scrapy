1.0,"Look, I know this is a budget scotch and rather young, but unless you're totally new to drinking this spirit, I'd avoid it. It smells stale, a bit like hay, and it has a very weak body. Flavor reminds me of dried grass sitting in rain water. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more on something else."
4.0,"Intense peat, some smoke and cereal sweetness. Also, a piney note. Overall tastes very young and lacks in complexity, however, at a $19 at Trader Joe's, this whiskey's a really good value for an Islay single malt."

3.0,"[Re-Review 022716] - Soft and creamy on the nose.  Dried raisins, and fruit snacks if you will.  Certainly harsh with bite, and a friuty delivery.  It's rather sweet and pure tasting. The finish is harsh, swift, and bitter.  An alternative single malt at a $22 price point is nothing to scoff at however.  After comparing this with my most recent experience at Whiskey Live, this young malt leaves much to be desired with where it supposedly comes from (Caol Ila? Lagavulin?)"
4.0,"Best value scotch by far,  especially for an Islay"

4.0,"It is as straight forward as it gets. It's a young, peaty, smokey islay. It's just that simple and it's good. Not great but good. It also makes a great Islay mule. Wondering what a little absinthe mixed in might do."

3.0,"A nice bottle with a nice price tag.
The nose is quite welcoming, although very smokey, with hints of sweet fruits.
The taste is all peat and smoke for me, which is a bit underwhelming given the nose.
Add a drop of water and there's only peat left.
All in all a fine Islay for the price."

1.0,"Nose: peat but heavy on a medicinal plastic side. Sea brine. 

Mouthfeel: watery. Not oily or rich at all. 

Taste: medium, short lived alcohol burn. Finish is short. Little to no depth that last as long as a flash in the pan. Dried fruit, honey is there if you look hard enough. Nothing really shines though. 

Daily low cost drinker? Meh. For the cost (depending on where you live) pick up a bottle of bowmore for the same price."
3.0,"My daily dram budget is in the sub $30 level. Saw this in Trader Joe’s and had to try it since I am a big Isaly, peaty whisky fan. I love this stuff and always have a bottle on hand. It almost seems to good to be true, I think it is almost as good as the Laphroig 10yr."

4.0,"Reminds me of a party on the beach; sea salt and campfire. The peat and salt come on quick and a bit of barrel notes fight their way through to the forefront. The burn is medium-light, but the flavors, primarily smoked salmon, stick around."
3.0,Can’t beat the price. Smoke is very apparent but not overwhelming. Smells like burnt bacon. Nice vanilla sweetness to match. One dimensional. I love using a 1/4 oz of this in a whiskey sour.

2.0,"I had this at a free tasting and actually decided to purchase the bottle for $30.  If for nothing else, I want to support my local distributor, and I can experiment with cooking using an Islay whisky.  This new edition just came out recently.  Rumors are that the older version was Lagavulin’s 5 year-ish abortions that were not up to Lagavulin’s standards.  This one did not remind me of Lagavulin at all.

NOSE: Weaker-than-Ardbeg, but reminds me of Ardbeg 10.  Campfire embers, earthy.  Not much else going on that’s pleasant.  Plastic and chalky.  Definitely young.  With a few drops of water, some green fruitiness and slight herbalness comes out.  Nothing meaty or medicinal that makes me think Lagavulin or Laphroaig.  Not very briny.

PALATE: Well-rounded and balanced earthy peat with overripe green apples.  Not stewed; just starting to rot on the branch.  I’m thinking of Bowmore.  Some liquorice, honeysuckle, vanilla.  A little bit of citrus, but not enough to point me towards Caol Ila.  Smooth and oily with some surprising complexity.

FINISH: Bitter.  Lemons.  Now it’s like immature Caol Ila.  Not offensive; I’m not making ugly faces.  Just unrefined, like my use of the word “abortion.”  Okay perhaps that’s offensive, but I don’t care.

VERDICT: This bottle is worth the money just to try to guess what distillery allowed Vintage Malt Whisky Company to bottle their bad stocks, but ban them from revealing the identity.  Also, the palate is quite nice.  Just don’t bother smelling it, or try savoring the aftertaste.  My thoughts are it is closest to Bowmore, but Bowmore clearly has no shame in bottling their abortions – they even call it “Legend.”  And this whisky is better than Bowmore Legend.  Maybe Ardbeg or Caol Ila?  It could still be Lagavulin.  I mean, it tastes nothing like it, but that could be why Lagavulin got rid of it.  MARK: 67/100."

3.75,"What a wonderful dram for the price.  An Islay whisky for under $20! Are you kidding? It has to be terrible right? Wrong. Very wrong. This dram now has a permanent home in my collection.

On the nose, there is slight smoke and strong peat with a touch of brine and iodine. 

On the palate, it exudes smoke, a little peat, burnt caramel, and if you search hard enough you’ll find a slight hint of stewed meat and honey.

The finish isn’t overly complex and doesn’t linger for too long like higher quality drams, but it finishes of beachside campfire with a little vanilla. A little medicinal as well.

Overall, it’s a damn good dram for the price I paid ($19 USD). I wouldn’t pay €30 for it, like some on here. For that price point, I’d buy a Bowmore or Laphroaig 10. But at $20, this Islay whisky is a steal and I’ll definitely be making it my daily dram."
4.0,Wie ein Stück Holz eines alten Walliser Chalets. Sehr rauchig und lecker.
5.0,I was excited from the time I poured my glass and smell the heavy peat. Taste makes you think of a bonfire on the beach and finish’s with a little spicy sweetness.

3.5,"Notes on the label:
Nose: Earthy smokey peat and salty ocean breeze. 
Palate: Pungent peat smoke, chewy sweet malt, pepper, tar and a touch of iodine.
Finish: Long and warming. Smokey ashes of the peat fire. 

I get band aids and sweet, smokey brine on the nose. The palate is semisweet, creamy, oily and viscous. The finish is medium length and warming with some savory, sweet notes.
Great value for $18.99 at Trader Joe's."

3.0,Nicht sehr weich.
3.25,Nice campfire smoke on the nose.  Mouth feel is soft. On the palate is less smoke with some honey. I also got a little spicy green pepper. Smoke hangs around on the finish with a little dark chocolate.
3.5,"Aroma is really peaty with sweetness underneath. Actually combines together rather nicely. Flavor is peat dominant, honey in the middle, and a black pepper tail. Very nice for the price point, at least medium rich. All it's missing is a longer tail and some complexity and it would be great."
4.0,"Nose: Earth, smoke, vegetal brine.  Honeyed cereal grains.  Buried vanilla.  Coffee, leather, rosemary, thyme, anise.  Tobacco.  Hint of oak.  Definitely on the younger end of the spectrum - some aspects of this haven't evolved or developed.  Bright and shiny, but not in an unappealing way.

Palate: Honey, toasted grains - the barley is getting a chance to be in the spotlight here.  Mint, lemon zest.  Bitter chocolate and black pepper.  Smokey, dry ash.  Tobacco, oak, fresh cut grass.  Cream.  Mouthfeel is medium, with the oil content here making things real interesting and some effervescence that betrays the 80 proof.  Finish is medium-long  and begins without much evolution - sweet barley,  smoke, earth.  The deeper notes disappear and plum and strawberry begins to poke through, with the barley morphing into a sweetened granola.  Smoke and ash present throughout, and the end coasts into mint, lemon oik, coriander seeds, thyme, and basil.

Other notes: I've been searching a while for a daily drinker peated Islay and I've found it.  That this was less than $25 out the door (tax included) puts a smile on my face.  It by no means isn't without flaw - the rumor mill says this is 6 years old and what's in the glass reflects that, but what IS here is good enough that I'll absolutely be keeping this one stocked in my home bar.  I'd also gladly recommend this to anybody looking to dive into the world of peat."
3.0,"85 - NAS, full, slight smoke, char, lingers a little"
2.75,"Nose: smoke/peat, salt, slow cooked meat

Taste: iodine/medicinal, salty sweetness/mint (only after a few minutes, then it exclusively tastes like iodine), wet smoke

Finish: iodine, ash

	Thoughts: Nose is really fantastic, but the flavor doesn’t match it. If it did this would be a much higher rating. Cheap as hell though."
