4.0,The cherry cask definitely changes the taste. Can tell it’s been in one.

4.5,"Nice nose. Initial taste is sweet, caramel and honey stood out for me. Nice even burn on the finish."
4.5,"I tend to find the sherry casks hit or miss. This one definitely hits the mark. Cinnamon and caramel apple notes with a nice light burn finish. This may be a go to in the future, but in any case a definite winner."
3.75,Slightly minty

4.0,"Tried before as a sample, from one of R friends. I like it better this time."
4.75,"Outstanding.  Great dessert profile set of flavors (caramel and more dessert profiles that I'm no sophisticated enough to capture)  Will buy a bottle for ""sure""."

4.25,"Sweet, slick-smooth mouth feel, ever slightly oaky, turning to bright citrus then ethanol with a slight raisen flavor, dry finish with freshly tanned leather tastes"

4.5,Sweet cherry pie and spice. Smooth and full of flavor. Would love to try this on the rocks. Drank neat today.
2.5,"So young on the nose it covers anything else up. Follows suit albeit to a much lesser degree on the palate. You get a hint of the Sherry notes. Medium-short finish. Not bad, but not worth it at the price range either. Hopefully time will let it open up more, for now I wish it had more time aging to give it the depth it deserves. 

Final Verdict: I'd been looking for this bottle for a while so I grabbed it for around $80. For $50, hate to say it but Angel's Envy gives me a much better nose, more complexity and better flavor than Dareringer."
1.25,"Third time trying it, and I just can't get past the cough-syrupy flavor to it. One of the worst sherry finished bourbons I've ever had."

3.75,A little sweet for me but has a nice creamy cherry and berry taste
5.0,A Dark chocolate cherry note in the middle/end of pallet with great flavors highly recommended

3.75,"After maybe only a few days in the zombiepocalypse, you'll want to clear your olfactory cavities with something sweet. This whiskey will do that. Surprisingly it tastes more earthy than you would expect from a sherry."
