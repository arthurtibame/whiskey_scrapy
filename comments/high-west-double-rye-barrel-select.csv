4.5,"Bought a bottle from Total Wine in Massachusetts from 2019. I’ve always been a huge fan of the normal double rye, it is what opened my eyes to the rye world and I still consider it one of the best bangs for your buck. This has a little less on the nose but packs considerably more flavor on the palate than the traditional."
