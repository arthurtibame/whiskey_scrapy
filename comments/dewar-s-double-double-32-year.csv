1.0,Candle wax. Maybe it was just this bottle but highly disappointed.
5.0,"I can’t believe this only received an 88...  this is not just whisky, this in an experience.  I can’t describe how well the deep malt and fruit notes intermingle here and it is amazing how the age shows in this one.  I had a hard time justifying the price but after tasting it I’m so glad I got a bottle... simply superb."

5.0,"Beautiful natural amber to copper color, non-chill filtered, very viscous, and oily. Nose is mature and complex, starting with a hint of smoked sprats in oil, mature oak, a hint of vanilla, and raisins on the back. Notes of dried grass and an old wooden house somewhere deep in the forest in the middle of fall keep coming to mind. The palate is complex, mostly sweet yet with a slight bitter oaky note, and aromas of figs, apple, raisins, vanilla, butter scotch, and lemon zest all playing well together in a beautiful symphony. You can definitely sense the influence of the sherry here. Finish is medium length, mostly vanilla and raisins, but the very last note is still that smoked oily fish that occurred on the initial nose. A few drops of water in this 46% ABV dram opened even more fruity character, but the oiliness and richness remain. Finish also gained more citrus character along with some apricot notes. Overall, this is a very complex and super smooth dram, well worth the money to try. Bought this one at Costco for $139 (375ml)."
