5.0,"Oh! Look! Its another 5 stars Talisker!!

This time is the distiller's edition 1996, bottled in 2008, with its traditional strength of 45.8%abv, a jewel on its own.

The color of this dram... unreal deep copper. 

On the nose: LET THIS BREATH FOR FULL ACTION: Sweet sherry madness, Pepper, Blacberry, Herbal, Medicinal. Nice aroma. Starts sweet, becomes peaty. 
Maraschino cherries syrup. Bacon.

On the palate: Mild peat, Sherry, cinnamon spice. Ashes and Salt. Incredible smooth. Delicious.

Aftertaste is super mouth numbing. Ginger atomic bomb. Salt and sherry sweetness. What an experience. 

Overall this dram is a 96 over 100, talisker does it again."
