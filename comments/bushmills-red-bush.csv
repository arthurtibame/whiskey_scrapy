3.0,"Loud nose, but settles for a subtle reminder of your mother's fruit dish with apples and bananas that are reaching their best by date in the sun.

Body is thin and closely related to the intro Bushmills. You can make out a little bit of the bourbon character from the aging. Nothing too exciting but the finish is easy and fresh, making for an easier drinker.

A decent and original Irish, not as outstanding as the Black Bush but for the price point ($23 a bottle), it can stand on its own as an intermediate Irish expression."

3.5,"$24 for this one in my area. Nose is delicate but rich with apple juice, pear, grain, shellac and a light smokiness. Neat it enters slightly sweet and grain forward. The apple and pear from the nose make a brief appearance. This is followed by a short and slightly hot finish with a light chocolate note lingering on the palate. You can definitely pick up on the fact that this is aged in ex bourbon casks. Verdict? This is good, a light easy uncomplicated sipper. From memory this is definitely worth the extra dollar or two over the White Label"

4.0,"4 stars... Price CHECK, Taste (CHECK), Consistency (CHECK) for $19 dollars this was the PERFECT share and sip bottle at a recent college football tailgate. fancy enough for some, easy enough for all. you get some of that basic bourbon profile which to me is overdone caramel vanilla cake (with alcohol) and it blends just fine with classic irish. makes a great boilermaker as well."

3.0,"Sitting with the wife, relaxing on the last day of a three day weekend (Presidents Day) and enjoying a Murphy’s Stout with a Sous Vide cooked steak.  I took a departure from scotch to enjoy something from the Southern neighbor. 

A metallic opening. Copper pennies mingled with tropical fruits. Dole pineapples and shredded coconut.  Given more time to see what else could come through, banana walnut bread with vanilla icing are in the fringes. 

A medium-light body that is soft and sweet. Sucrose, vanilla and Angostura bitters and a small amount of dill are all about the palate that is somewhat short.

A slight pepper spice with a dash of Worcestershire close the act, albeit shorter than I would want. 

Bushmills is quietly a pleasant and simple Irish whiskey.  This Red Bush is a nice sweet and spicy dram.  Works well as a side with a rich stout. Unpretentious, simple and enjoyable.  [$27][85/100][Tasted: 2/19/18]"

4.0,"It has a soft sweet aroma full of vanilla backed with oak and light honey. The flavor is malty with a BIG vanilla note. There is some charred white oak but it is very soft, also has an almost peaty taste towards the finish. The vanilla is very pronounced throughout which is delicious! The body is light and creamy. Thoroughly enjoy this on a hot summer evening neat with a glass of water on the side."

3.5,"Strong vanilla and honey on the nose, with sweet grainy confections like oatmeal cookie. Apart from the bakery aromas, this smells almost exactly like you are about to taste an actual bourbon. The sweet expectation is not immediately met, however, as the entry is surprisingly sharp, with a piercing spiciness of wood and young grain, which then mellows out into the more familiar honey that the nose promised. I think this disjointed entry is unique to a fresh bottle, as it is smoothed over a little if open for a while. In any case, the spice eventually reemerges with a little bitterness, and lingers into the short finish. While not quite as good on its own as I was expecting, I got this specifically because I thought that it would pair nicely with summertime beers. I was not wrong on that front; this (or Black Bush) is exactly the kind of thing you want for that. Definitely one of my favorite all-around cheap blends."

3.0,"Appearance: The color here on this Irish whiskey is not as red as you would be led to believe, it’s actually a light golden hue. The legs are also very watery.

Nose: This nose is more subdued than the Bushmills Original. There are notes of honey, cherry, petrichor (the smell of after it rains), sour candy, paint, and I assume from the bourbon barrel influence, corn and vanilla notes.

Taste: The palate is delicious but subtle with notes of strawberry, buttered toast, dark chocolate, all contained in a creamy mouthfeel.

Finish: The finish is medium in length and leaves a dry, unripe pear aftertaste.

Thoughts: I had this dram in a two whiskey flight comparing the Bushmills Original to its sister, the Red Bush. I didn't like the Red Bush as much as the Original though it's still a great whiskey! I think it was unique and I did enjoy it, but the Original and the Black Bush are my preferred choices. Thanks, Bushmills! Sláinte!"

3.0,"The nose is timid, you do pick up a bit of vanilla. The body is somewhat thin and sweet, predominately vanilla but if you search hard enough you can pick up a bit of oak and tobacco, certainly not overly complex but very smooth and easy. A bit of pepper on the short finish. While there is nothing to really dislike about this one there isn’t anything truly outstanding either, I honestly prefer the original and their Black Bush."

3.75,"Bushmill's Red Bush is sorta like the non-identical twin of the standard Bushmill's white label. The best I can determine both of them are of the same “:juice.” The difference is that the Red is aged only in first fill bourbon barrels, and the traditional white label is aged in bourbon (not only first fill) barrels, and a few sherry casks. To me it compares to how you prefer one of your favorite meal entrees to be prepared. For example, two servings of shrimp scampi being prepared side by side; one with extra butter, the other with extra garlic. Both are shrimp scampi, but with nuances of flavor differences. That is how I view these two Bushmill whiskeys nosing and tasting them side by side. The Red clearly has more oak wood and vanilla influence, and the traditional white label has less vanilla and a slight hint of fruitiness from the sherry casks. (I don't think they use very many sherry casks, for it is truly a “hint” of sherry influence.) Which you prefer I think boils down to which flavor profile you prefer. If you require something more distinct or special, I suggest Black Bush, with 80% malt and a strong sherry influence."

3.5,Mellow spice with a bit of bite at the end. Finish is short and quick. Not good enough for an everyday but not a bad choice.
4.0,Lovely aroma. Bourbon on the nose and finish. Oakey. Very smooth.
2.5,"Nose is light and sweet, dominated by an apple juice aroma with a slight spice in the background. 

Palate is light, almost watery, with spice and some vanilla. Finish is short with a slight burn. 

I’m not sure what the purpose of this label is. It is matured in bourbon casks, but those casks haven’t imparted many bourbon flavors, except maybe the vanilla on the palate. The flavors also aren’t as rich as the Black Bush nor do they distinguish themselves as much different from other Bushmills offerings. Which leaves the Red Bush in an awkward position. 

Red Bush is decently enjoyable, but unfortunately I can’t recommend this whiskey to anyone as it lacks any distinguishing characteristics or value."

1.75,Not quite Irish Whiskey. More rock'n roll than Irish pub country.
2.5,"Can’t say I’m a fan. Very very young, bright, shiny, and alcoholic tasting (at a weak 40%). Not totally awful by itself, but it’s begging to be touched up in some way, whether that’s ice or being mixed into a cocktail. Once you do that then it tastes fine. Regardless, I could never get the flavor to be all that interesting."

3.75,"So years ago I tried Bushmills White Label years ago and it was absolutely terrible. With that in mind, I was quite reluctant to try any other Bushmills product but I saw this on sale and decided to give it a try and I am so glad I did. I really enjoyed this whiskey. The nose is light and fruity and this is the first Irish whiskey that I could smell something other than vanilla. It has a wonderfully light apple and pear nose but it is not overly sweet. It does flatten out if you add ice or water but it does have a great flavor. I made a Highball with this and club soda and on a hot day, it is very refreshing. Overall, I was impressed with this and would recommend this over the white label every day. Now it is an Irish whiskey and that means the taste is light and it leaves your mouth quickly but at its price point it is just fine for rounding out your home bar or as a gift for someone that likes Irish whiskey. I like it."

3.5,"Sweet and kind of fruity, really nice to drink with a surprising amount of flavor for an Irish whiskey. Not super smooth, but not a lot of heat either."
3.0,"This is Bushmills reaching out to the American Whiskey drinker, who usually shoots, or mixes. The review is spot on: this does well as a Shooter, or with a beer 'back.' And like Johnnie Walker Red (is there a connection?) it's a great Mixer. I generally don't drink Whiskey straight, or on the rocks, so I guess I'm the target audience (lol.)"
