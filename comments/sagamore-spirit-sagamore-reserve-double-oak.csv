3.5,Herbal. Dill. Floral. Toasted barrel. Rye. Medium sweetness. Has an oakiness that is is more reminiscent of oak chips than an oak barrel.

3.75,Incredible amounts of oak and brine on the nose.  Rye and spice cake on the tongue. Not a lasting finish but a great sipper.
2.5,"Sour. Sour Sour Sour.  Clearly that was the intent, but not my thing."

4.0,"Nose- grain/rye, toasted oak, vanilla, maple syrup. 
Mouthfeel starts off a bit thin but then lingers and coats with a gradual warming. 
Solid straight rye whiskey."

4.5,"Sweeter, smooth, slightly woody, cozy/cuddly. Good for sipping. Supposedly good for cocktails. 
Smells slightly of vanilla, Carmel, and wood"

4.25,"Warm and woody like fresh timber, a little sweet like carmel; good for sipping and recommended for cocktails as well. “Maryland mule” It makes me want snow outside my window while I’m on the couch. Might be hard to get outside of Maryland/the home distillery (in Baltimore)."
4.75,"With a couple ice cubes, this is close to a perfect rye"

4.0,"Tasted 5/15/19 at Whiskey House, San Diego. 

This was my favorite in Sagamore’s product line. The double barrel process really makes a different from their regular straight rye, you get much more pronounced oak flavors. For it being a rye whiskey, it has a very mild flavor profile and minimal amounts of a typical rye spice."
4.5,smooth vanilla and I get chocolate..this is good

4.0,"Really fantastic!  Oak comes through at the end, not overpowering, just a little “how’s your father.”  Carmel, sweet fruit smooth finish."
3.75,"Revisited last night. Not bad. Tastes young with a slight rye spice bite at the end.  Not super spicy.  Very smooth, with a decent marshmallow quality I associate with and want in ""Double Oak"" bottles.

Medium mouthfeel and sweet with notes of vanilla and oak."

4.5,Currently the favorite rye in my collection ahead of Pikesville Rye(2nd) and Lot No 40 Canadian Rye (3rd). Great full body flavor and finish. Sweet and oaky with a nice hint of spices.

4.0,"Nose: Caramel, baking spices, dried orange peel

Palate: oily, smooth, pretty hot

Soft caramel, very sweet, oaky, coconut. Doesn’t go down the full rye bitter path.  Coconut.  Long finish, get a bit of butter pepper at the end.  

Delicious - excellent American rye whiskey.  Embodies an America rye, maybe"

4.75,Spicy but smooths out quickly. Wonderful mouth feel.  Vanilla and sugar come through.  Better neat than on ice or with water.  Let it breathe a bit and this is just a fantastic way to spend some time.  Sometimes have to remind myself this is a rye.
4.0,Pretty smooth and spicy.  Eventually gives way to caramel-like oak.
4.25,"Woodsy, oaky sweet and rich flavor. Great taste. Enjoyed sipping on neat. First place out of 5 in a blind taste test with pikesville 110 proof straight rye in 2nd and woodford reserve double oak in 3rd"
