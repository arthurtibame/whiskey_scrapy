3.5,"As a Baltimorean with a love of high proof firewater, my opinion may be taken with a grain of salt - but I think Epoch is a bit underrated per Distiller’s expert review. This is a chewy, warm, Xmas spicy, ORANGE PEEL sip that is one of the very few ryes I’ve ever been tempted to order a second pour on (serious bourbon drinker here, rye usually does nothing for me.) Complexity and depth are already present, but could go to another level. Based on my experience with Epoch, I am absolutely psyched to see what may come out of BWC’s aged reserves in future. Another year or two in the barrels may reveal something truly exceptional."
4.0,"Spicy, with floral notes and high proof. Warm with slight vanilla notes. Long finish."

4.0,"Nose of smoke and spice, a slight tang like sour cherries. Definitely spice forward on the palate, more smoke, the malt is present but not overwhelming. Have not tried it yet but imagine it will make a fun Manhattan."
5.0,"Lively nose of tropical fruits and agricole on top of a classic and welcomed vanilla and maple syrup typical of new cask American whiskey. Sweet and big on the tongue, with a finish dry and mildly tannic. With a little bit of water, the bolder notes give way to a subtler, malty sweetness reminiscent of lowland Scotch. Best 2 year rye I've had, and at 40 bucks a 750 @ 100 proof, totally recommendable."

Did blind taste test with Sagamore and Epoch 3-Year

Was harsher than Sagamore and, at the time, indistinguishable from the 3-Year"
