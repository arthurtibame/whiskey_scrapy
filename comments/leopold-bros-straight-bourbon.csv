2.5,"This bourbon whiskey is a honey gold color with thin viscous legs.

The nose is funky and quite different; There is a note of warm muggy pond moss reminding me of my parents’ pond in the summer. There are other notes like wet straw, dusty corn, boiled carrots, and candy corn.

The palate is simple with an oily mouthfeel. There are notes of honey, bitter herbs, Froot Loops cereal, and yeasty bread.

There is a medium length, dry and grassy finish.

This bourbon was very unusual. It didn’t possess many typical “bourbon notes,” so if one’s wanting a different adventure that’s still in the bourbon camp, this is for you, I however wasn’t a big fan. Sorry Leopold, I’d like to be won over by some other product of yours though! Cheers!"
