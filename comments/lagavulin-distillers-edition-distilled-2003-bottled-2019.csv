4.5,"The nose is welcomed by the fleshiness of the barbecue with a massive salty and mineral splash, which soon let the sweetest soul of the whisky emerge, with blood orange, melon, licorice, cloves. Pappery bread. Tough but elegant, a sort of 007 with Daniel Craig.
On the palate it is more delicate, peppery and very marine (fish crudity), with ferrous tones of grilled meat, like lamb chops. More blood orange, pine nuts, cocoa paste, licorice. Full-bodied but not energetic, very balanced, perhaps too much.
Fairly long finish, of ash, sea, spices and orange.
Probably the gradation has somewhat turned off the power of Lagavulin, which thanks to the sherry and the PX is perhaps too much affable for my tastes.
Don't get me wrong, it is still an excellent drink, structured and rich, but I would have liked more bite."

4.25,"The nose is filled with the slightly sweet peat of Laga, with a scent of sea salt. It has intensity but not choking.

On palate there is chocolate and caramel coming out quickly. Smoky and peaty as expected. The oily texture makes you feel like it is a very rich dessert with fancy smoke but is not as sweet.

The finish actually brings a bit of charcoal and grass. It is soft and pleasant."
3.75,Bring this to Nick Offerman’s next Christmas Party. He’ll treat you with a steak and 45 minutes of fireside love. Dark amber hue and typical Lagavulin peat. Classic Islay.
