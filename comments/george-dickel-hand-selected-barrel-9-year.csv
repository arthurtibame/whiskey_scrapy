5.0,"By far one of my favorites!! Has a wonderful charred barrel taste that meets with a caramel and hint of banana, vanilla and spices...good on ice or neat!"

4.0,My favorite whisky out Tennessee. Has a sweet butterscotch with some spice on the backside. Has a little burn but not too bad. It is somewhat hard to come by unless tou are in the area. It is smoother that the Dickel 12 and always seems to have a better flavor than the Barrel Select. A couple of differt places around Nashville carry it. Accidentally killed a bottle with my neighbor one night. So it goes dow surprisingly well.

4.0,"Orange , wheat, Carmel,  maraschino cherries, malt, low spice, smooth. Good,

It’s a nice classic mature tasting bourbon, great neat, has moderate complexity to it. Try it or buy it, you won’t be disappointed."

4.0,"Nose - Sweet vanilla caramel, creme brulee browned sugar topping, light toasted oak, sugar coated brioche.
Taste - Dark caramels, cinnamon spice heat, vanilla brown simple, light oak bitterness.
Finish - Lingering cinnamon spice, heavy vanilla brown sugar simple with a tinge of green sapling bitterness.
Score - 87/100
Final Thoughts - This was a bit surprising to me as I liked it a bit more than I thought I would. It's not very complex and I would say that it's what you think a generic bourbon would taste like, but turned up a notch due to the proof. Not too complex, nothing really offensive, just a higher proof generic ""bourbon."" This almost tastes like Russell's Reserve 10 if it was 100 proof."

2.0,"From The Wine and Cheese Place. A tinge of beef jerky on the nose? And nuts, the signature Dickel profile. On the palate, tastes like cola. A chemical, preservative note to it as well. A unique flavor. The right amount of heat. Again, unique. 7/3/17"
4.0,"The standard Barrel Select is fantastic this is just a step behind. The flavors are still great, but the higher proof doesn't bring the flavors together as well and I'm a proof whore."

4.0,"The more I drink of this, the more I genuinely love it. This one was such a surprise. It's distinct from your standard bourbon and hits each note with confidence. I have to say, this was my first dabble in a Tennessee whiskey and it's set the bar extremely high. Sweet tones like maple and brown sugar. Warm and soothing while you enjoy it. It's a true charmer. (FWF share #13)"
5.0,"This is Tennessee's reason for existence. The state peaked when this was released; it's only downhill from such a summit. The dram is nearly everything I could ask for in a bourbon or Tennessee whiskey: a nose that's bursting with orange peel, cherry, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, and a little buttery corn, and a rich, smooth palate that integrates those elements from the nose with a leathery aged note and ends with a spicy, creamy, long chocolate caramel finish. Three cheers to the Volunteer State!"

4.25,"9 yo Single Barrel selected for New Hanover County ABC. This is a Single Barrel product so your mileage may vary.
APPEARANCE: Pours into the Glencairn a light Amber. A quick swirl leaves an oily coating and forms fat slow moving legs.
NOSE: Light, Caramel Corn, Graham Cracker, Tropical Citrus & Coconut, Cinnamon, Light Dusty Oak, with a healthy dose of alcohol. Less banana than I usually get from Whisky that has been through the Lincoln County Process, but it is faintly there. The mineral note usually found in Dickel is either missing or so light that I don't detect it.
NEAT: Chocolate Covered Marshmallows, Eggnog, Cinnamon, and Light Oak. Smooth Finish with limited burn. Coats the palate with lingering Oak, Vanilla, and Cinnamon. 
SPLASH: A few drops of water brightens the nose and gives it a floral quality. Adds a bubblegum sweetness and a little more oak to the palate. A hint of the Flintstone multi-vitamin makes an appearance. 
VERDICT: Living in an ABC state severely limits access to barrel picks, so I try and pick them up when I see them. I'm a fan of all things Cascade Hollow and this is no exception. I'm going to really enjoy this bottle."

4.0,"Notes of oak, dark chocolate and a bit of heat. Smooth for the proof."
4.0,"Just so solid and smooth. The notes of chocolate are there instantly which I can't say I noticed in the aroma.  Easy drinking, subtle spice, and just really good overall. I enjoy this for sure.."
3.0,Pretty good.  After trying it with a few drops of water it definitely opened up the taste.

Nose is almost undetectable."

4.25,Smooth as smooth can be. Little oily. Light nose considering the proof. Very pleasing on the palate. Sweet finish. One of my favorites in the price range.
3.75,"A little rough around the edges by comparison. Over a cube of ice though, smooths out nicely and exposes the sweetness."
4.0,Great flavor
5.0,"Tasted at the distillery. Sweet, smooth and very oily. It's the 12 only amped up a notch. And single barrel."
3.25,"My first try of a Dickel offering. I know many reviewers have found a uniqueness to Dickel similar to Beam peanut funk or Jack Daniel's banana flavor. Let's see what it holds. 

Initially some ethanol on the nose but after 5 minutes in the glass it's gone leaving a nice aroma of corn dust, toasted marshmallow, pencil shavings, tire rubber (uh oh), and mineral/vitamins (further uh-oh)

On the palate there's some richness with predominant flavors being caramel, almost burnt buttered toast, oak, and marzipan. 

The finish? Well, crap. There it is; Flintstone vitamins. Specifically the peach colored/flavored one. There is also cinnamon, oak, and mint here as well but the mineral note really kicks your ass and not in a good way, which makes me thankful that the duration is only medium length. It is soft for the proof I will give it that. 

Overall, there's some decent things here in the beginning, but the finish ruins this for me. Just too damn weird. I can't say I'd recommend this, especially at the price point. But maybe I won't die of scurvy now having had my vitamins and all..."

4.25,"I’ve been enjoying the #12 and really enjoying the new BiB. A local store had a 9yr pick so here it is...

The nose has sweet vanilla, caramel, and corn.

The palate has sweet corn, some caramel and vanilla. On later sips I also get some cola.

Finish is a little burn and brings back some of the memorable corn and sweet notes of a medium length.

I like this one. I guess I’m officially a Dickel fan! This one is a slight variation of their #12 and BiB. The flavors are not as pronounced on this one, but offers different ones. So I guess it’s a nicer, un-offensive (to some) version of the other two (which I also really like)."

4.0,"Toasted marshmallow and caramel on the nose, hot and spicy on the palate and finish. Splash of water opens up floral and oak notes on the nose, tames the palate while adding buttery toffee, and makes for a fairly smooth, peppery, medium finish"
4.0,spicy. really dark. I like it
4.25,"On my second bottle, for the price, one of my favorites.  I will put this up against a lot of whiskies blind and it will fair quite well."
3.0,"Store pick from One Stop in Johnson City, TN. Not a super strong anything on this dram. Eminently drinkable, but don’t look for too much complexity. Has the typical Dickel mineral/vitamin note, but it’s tamer than in other whiskeys from the line. Decent midrange bourbon, but there are better out there for the price."
4.0,"Smooth for 51.5%.  Sweet notes with little bite makes for easy sipping. Recommended by the Keith at the Cumming liquor store, and definitely didn’t disappoint."
2.75,"Soft and super approachable. Cinnamon forward with light char. Apples and cinnamon, light foamy sweetness"
3.0,"I want to like this bottle but it's over oaked for my pallet. On a positive note it blows doors on the Basil Hayden dark rye... Since this is a single barrel TW pick, I'll chalk it up to luck of the draw & keep an open mind on Dickel."
