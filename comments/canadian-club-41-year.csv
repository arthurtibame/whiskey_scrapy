5.0,"This is easily the best Canadian whiskey I have had.  Extremely complex and subtle.  Requires patience.  I give it a minimum of 30 minutes, but really needs more.  Expect nothing out of it from drink and pour; it will taste watered down and boring.  Needs no added water.  After proper rest, vanilla and ginger dominate with an evolving fruit potpourri of flavors on the palate.  All of this is backed up by a dusty oaky/rye foundation that never intrudes, but gives the spirit just enough backbone.  Exceptional!"

4.0,"No detailed tasting notes today, I am sorry... we were just enjoying the experiences and sharing our first impressions.  I will go back to this and delve deeper once I’ve had more time with it.
—
Initially, aromas of sherry wine and cognac were dominant, with flavourful corn whisky throughout.
-
Given time, the corn came more to the nose and rye spice along with the cognac’s French oak spice revealed themselves on the palate.
-
As more time passed, those rye notes started to present themselves to the nose while the wine notes receded, and the flavour started to become more full bodied.
-
After more than an hour the whisky really started to reveal itself, presenting a little oak, but not nearly so much as one mag expect for a spirit that has spent so long inside a barrel."
2.0,"Bought this with very high expectations, after hearing how many people loved the C.C. 40 last year. Unfortunately, I was met with a whisky that did not live up to the expectations I had for it. The whisky I tried tasted like watered down, extremely weak, Canadian whisky (Though I acknowledge that there may have been something off about the bottle I received.)

In my opinion, it's worth maybe $40 CAD, not $300. I'd recommend C.C. Chairman's Select 100% rye instead."

4.5,"Beautiful Whiskey, I was trying to find a place that sold a glass, ended up buying a bottle instead. I'm glad I did, its such an elegant interesting flavor. Starts with vanilla, real maple, lightly sweet, gives way to oily thin mouthfeel, gets tingly spicey and almost mint finish that lasts for a good long while."

5.0,"One if the most complex Sweet whiskies I've had. Never overpowering, lot of bright spices and slight barrel notes dancing around. Very silky and luxurious."
