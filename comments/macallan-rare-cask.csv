4.0,"The first fill sherry casks shows up at the onset.  This is a classic example of a good single malt.   The biggest downside (and hence the four starts instead of five) is the price.  For a NAS single malt, and close to $400, you can do better (think almost 2 bottles of Yamazaki 18 or 3 bottles of Highland Park 18)"

5.0,Unbelievably good. The trip this scotch sends your taste buds on is amazing. It's almost as though you can feel the journey of this scotch as you savor each sip.  Full bodied with a great spice profile smoothed out by the sherry. Truly delightful. Thank you #raisethemacallan!

I just opened my second bottle and I'm determined to keep this one as a top-shelf staple in my collection. I've been able to find it for $275, not $400. Put that up against the Macallan 18, and this is a much better value."

To me, it only promises a refinement of the flavors in the 12 and the 18 (I like the brashness of the 12, but I will happily drink the 18). It was really good (hence, four stars), but there's no way in hell I'd pay to drink it."

It carries the same dried rich fruits that define the Macallan house style, and evokes the sense of the 12 year and 18 year sherries, only this one has a slightly deeper flavor, and  carries a noticeably longer finish.  It would be a lie to say that I didn't want one of these on my shelf!"

4.0,"Well tonight's review is bittersweet for me. I'm watching the last Detroit Red Wings game at Joe Louis Arena, and seeing all the great players past and present pay tribute to the Joe and the team, and the final playing of Journey's Don't Stop Believing at JLA made me want to break out a special bottle to join in the celebration. 

Macallan Rare Cask is a Premium NAS scotch bottled at 43% ABV. It is non chill filtered as far as I know and is natural color of what I would call a dark rusty amber. 

A sherry bomb at no mistake on the nose, rich and sweet. Up front it's sherry wine, brown sugar coated raisins, prunes, grapes  and dates. A strong note of black cherries and cola. Toffee and burnt sugar. There is a slight sulfur note like burnt matches. Not smoky, but sulfurous. I found this in the 12 year sherry wood and it was off putting but it's not like that here, more subdued. Wood spices, soft vanilla and cinnamon and sweet syrup. It's a very mature and elegant nose. I would guess an average age of 15-18 years. Some older casks and some younger as well. It's one of those whiskies I could nose for hours. 

The palate has an unexpected peppery arrival. Dried red fruits, sherried fruits, and sherry wine. Very mature. Faint oak and cocoa powder. Orchard fruits like apricot and nectarines. Sweet, almost too sweet, it walks that edge successfully. Quite elegant. 

A little thin on the mouthfeel, but it is silky and a little mouthwatering, turning dry. The finish is medium long. Sweet and a little spicy. Oak, sherry, dried apricots and syrup. 

Rare Cask is definitely a great whisky for those who love sherried whiskies. It might be too sweet for the die hard peat heads. I think an additional 3% ABV would have helped, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and I'll be sad when the bottle is gone because I doubt I will pony up for the high price of this bottle again. The only reason I bought it was because I was able to get it at 25% off. Looks like the final count of octopi thrown onto the ice tonight was 37 and the score I'm giving this dram is 4.5. If you have money and you want a special occasion bottle, this is a good way to go. Cheers."

5.0,"Thanks for the tip-off Amanda. Agree why you rated this 98, though mysteriously it doesn't make Serge at whiskey fun's 90 benchmark coming in at 87. I give it top whack. NOSE-dark cherry alright! Unlike most other noses, interesting that there is no floral which you might expect ; PALATE- yes, raisins a plenty, dark chocolate with high cocoa, creamy vanilla (as opposed to thin-wood-vanilla you get in some budget Highland malts) can't make out the dates and though i like dates they do have a bland taste so no problem; the body is velvet, rich, thick even more than a Dalmore 18 year! FINISH- Yup as Amanda says it goes on forever. I'm now too much in awe to touch the bottle again, and dare not show it to friends. The price is right, it's just too good to drink regularly PS no water/ice required, thats a sin! :)"

2.0,"This represents everything I hate about scotch, and I regret buying this bottle.  
      
      OBSERVATION: The stores that sell this for $300+, move this product, and sell out.  The stores that are slashing prices still have 10 of these on the shelves.  The price that got me to bite is $225.  Macallan clearly appeals to those who feel the value of the liquid inside is affected by how much they spent on it.  That is to say, the more you spend on this bottle, the better it will taste.  Which is ridiculous.  Secondly, fancy packaging is not welcomed.  The rare cask is an eyesore, both in the information it provides and in the ridiculous 20 pound bottle.  “Only 1% of the whiskies made the cut and were chosen for their color and depth of flavor…”  STFU marketing prats.  There are bad casks in here - it’s obvious.  At $50, they aren’t bad casks, at $200+, and when you’re Macallan, these shouldn’t be present.  The arrival is quality, but then there are sulphurous notes that aren’t intentional in the Macallan profile.  It’s NAS because it probably contains substandard casks that are younger than 12 years.  
      
      WHAT I LIKED: It’s also obvious that there are good casks in here.  This is better than the 12 year, for sure.  Is it better than the similarly-priced 18 year?  I don’t know about current bottlings because I haven’t tried them, but the arrival for the rare cask is reminiscent of the glory days of Macallan, when 18 year olds were vintaged, and I would sweat about paying $20-30 for a pour out of bottles that today cost over $1000.  There is nutmeg, sultanas, and dark chocolate.  Followed by red oranges, slightly burnt coffee.  The spiciness is just right with hints of cloves and cracked peppercorn.  There is a good deal of smokiness for a Macallan, not from peat, but from alligator staves.  
      
      VERDICT: There is quality present, but it is polluted by cheaper casks, which is almost as distracting as the baroque presentation.  Stop inflating the price with visual appeal.  Minus $50 for the bottle, minus $50 for the ridiculous marketing blurb… $125 is a reasonable price for this product.  Call this buyer’s remorse, but HERE IS WHAT YOU CAN GET INSTEAD: Ardbeg Uigeadail and Aberlour A’bunadh are the twin pillars of value in the peated and sherried NAS world, respectively.  You can buy both and still have change.  If you want to stay within the Macallan house, you can buy both Edition No. 1 and No. 2.  Number 2 happens to be the best Macallan I’ve had this decade, and I think is guaranteed to soar in value after bottles run out, similar to the vintage 18 year olds bottled in 1999-2007.  If you want to try how Macallan 18 used to taste 10-15 years ago, get the Glendronach Parliament instead of Rare Cask.  If you want to spend $100 more on a sherried whisky that, I’m afraid, is worth the ridiculous price tag: Balvenie TUN 1509 Batch 2.
      
      MARK: 86/100.  Yes, that’s a high mark, and is based on the quality of the liquid; but like I said, this is overpriced and I hate what it represents, so I’m going to give it 2 stars."

4.0,"I tried a small sample of this last night, and this is not quite a 98 for me.  I'm generally wary of expensive, no-age-statement scotches.  And, while this scotch wasn't a huge letdown, and in fact was pretty tasty, I would not buy a bottle for the $250-300 it demands.  This is a classic Macallan sherried whisky.  The distillery claims that a high proportion of the casks used are first-fill and, based on the scent, I believe it.  There are clear, relatively pure notes of cherry, vanilla, sherry, and dry chocolate (kind of like the chocolate shavings or parts that are left after you've eaten most of a bar).  I also sense some musty oak, so this certainly smells like an aged expression, not a young one, and older than 15 years on average.  I even detect some brine or iodine, a note I more commonly find in Islay scotches.  I'm not sure where it's coming from, but it's a surprising touch.  The nose is the best part of this scotch.  It tastes like graham cracker, again some sherry and cherry, hazelnut, raspberries and other rich, sweet berries, and some more chocolate.  Again, oak spice indicates that the average age of this dram is significantly older than Macallan 12, so -- say what you will -- it's not scamming us too badly on the age.  The palate doesn't impress as much as the nose, however.  At the end, there are flavors of chocolate and dried fruits, particularly dates, and a bit of freshness from a mixture of mint and ginger.  Look, this is a good whisky.  It has a famous brand name.  You can show the bottle off to your friends, family, and guests.  Those facts all add some value, with the amount depending on the individual consumer's preferences.  But, for me, there is such a wealth of sherried scotches with age statements and that cost less (GlenDronach 18, Dalmore 18, Balvenie 15 Sherry Cask, Glenfarclas 17), it's just hard to justify this price point."

4.0,"No other brand breaks my heart as much as Macallan. For me, it’s all about consistency. While they offer some great scotch, Rare Cask has some amazing elements, but essentially falls flat where it counts.

The highlight by far is the nose. Extremely rich, offering deep red hues and cherry. The sherry is expertly displayed. A moment later, vanilla accompanied by brown sugar, soil, citrus, and a brilliant vanilla fudge make their appearance with pristine elegance.

This is easily one of the smoothest scotches I’ve ever had. There delicious caramel and a medium to full bodied mouthfeel. There’s even hints of tide and a touch of salt. It’s quite enjoyable. Rare Cask has virtually no heat. I mean, it’s barely there at all. That makes it incredibly easy to sip, but... also kind of boring.

This is really good. That much is for sure. However, yet again, the “soul” of this dram seems to be missing. I mentioned as much with their Fine Oak 15 Year. How is something crafted so well missing this crucial element? It’s a true shame. In my opinion, this shifts it from being worth $300+, to being something I wouldn’t buy at $120. I expect some to disagree.

The finish is dry, lingering a bit but doesn’t stay all that long. The package is wrapped up in almond and oak on the tongue.

Should you try it if the opportunity presents itself? Absolutely. Just be aware that it may not be all you were hoping for.

Lots of honey on the palate for me, too. Sherry is the main player here though. Dark fruits like cherries, blackberries... Ah who knows, just try it for yourself. You'll be glad you did."

4.0,"We celebrated my mother’s 96th birthday yesterday, so I’m feeling a little nostalgic. She’s a crusty, blue-blooded Yankee whose Dutch ancestors arrived in New Amsterdam (New York City) twelve generations earlier. Her father was English and her maternal grandmother was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, so I guess this is where I get my affinity for scotch. It wasn’t always this way, however, as my paternal grandfather immigrated from Italy early in the 20th century and was one hell of a winemaker. He settled in a suburb north of Boston and had a winepress forged by the town’s last blacksmith. It still sits in my 200 year old basement waiting to come out of retirement. If ever the world is annihilated by way of nuclear holocaust this winepress will be the last thing still standing. Years ago, I talked my father and a couple other family members into making wine. It was an interesting ritual that took place at the Chelsea Produce Market in Boston. The old-time Italians would only buy Zinfandel grapes from California because they had the highest sugar content. Even then, selecting the right brand required a ceremonial process equivalent to joining the Freemasons. The custom involved squeezing the clear juice from a grape and rubbing it between your fingers to test for stickiness. The stickier the better because this meant a high sugar content and, therefore, stronger wine. After an hour of arguing a selection was made and we would then move to another area where fresh, 50-gallon whiskey barrels could be purchased for 15 dollars. It was important to shake all the barrels until you could hear some whiskey sloshing around. This would insure the wood was well saturated to minimize leakage and also aid in raising the final ABV of the wine to about 17%. The only drawback to this recipe was red wine that tasted a little like Jack Daniel’s, and this is where the story finally wraps back around to the Macallan Rare Cask. Initially, I found the sherry influence of this expression overpowering. The first time I sat with this whisky I couldn’t help remembering those whiskey barrels of years ago and their effect on the wine. I know Macallan went to great lengths selecting only the top 1% of their sherry cask aged whiskies for this vatting (most first-fill), but, apparently, they did too good a job. It prompted one of my Macallan-loving friends to ask if this expression was a vatting of whisky and sherry. He didn’t like it much and I also had my reservations. Over time, however, this spirit has really grown on me, raising my rating to a solid 4 stars. Now, when I get in the mood for “heavy on the sherry,” nothing else satisfies. :)"

5.0,"On the nose, berries, dates, milk chocolate, orange peel, honey, old leather and the mustiness of an old book store. There was a faint sulfur smell when I opened the bottle. I took about three drams out, let it oxidize for a couple of weeks, and the sulfur was gone the next time I opened it. On the palate, I get everything I got on the nose, and it is oh so rich. This was a fun bottle to take my time with over about 5-6 months. I will probably buy another bottle at some point in the future."

I ordered a glass of macallan rare cask next to a bunnahabhain 12yr —- the bunna blew it away in every aspect; from the nose, palate, mouthfeel, to the finish- .... and worst of all the macallan didn’t even have that round mouth feel that I’m used to. I’m not going to get into the specifics of flavor elements - however I’ll just say it was totally undecipherable and unimpressive all along the way. ..  watch out for expensive NAS whiskey people- no matter how they try to sell it-  it’s drug dealer mentality at the corporate level plaguing our shelves more and more .🤮"

Palate: More oak than the nose hints at, rich flavor but mouthfeel is a little thin, some of the orange cones through.

Finish: fairly short and oaky with a quick wisp of apple.

Overall, I remember liking this more the first few pours of the bottle.  It does not do particularly well as the bottle empties."

Very little aftertaste (although with a slight soap / shampoo flavour) almost too polished and slightly without character, but then again I sometimes find Macallans are like that. It's a solid effort and I'll give it a solid 3.75 I think. Definitely wouldn't buy a bottle whatever the price."

5.0,"Blimey....been a while since my laste tasting. Had a couple drinks here and there, but mostly been alcohol free lately. No time to enjoy it, and I'm too old to drink for the sake of getting drunk. 

This one was always high on my list, and today it just happened. Worth the wait. 

The MaCallan Rare Cask is one of the very few 200€+ bottles I would actually consider buying. If I had any whisky budget left (Pro tip...when you say ""I don't need a powerful PC...might as well downscale""....don't use PC Part Picker...I'm now running out of space for monitors). It is expensive, but worth every cent. 

The nose starts mild and sweet. Not for every day, but when it fits the mood it is glorious. There are cherries, plums and hazelnut-milk-chocolate up front, with a bit of cereal below everything. Awesome, good start. 

The taste is somewhat compley, but never gets overwhelming. A gentle dose of vanilla, followed by breakfast cereals with honey, hazelnuts, cinnamon, some more chocolate and finally some spices, mostly cloves and cinnamon. Reminds of a spiced chai tea. Damn fine stuff. 

Aftertaste is spicy chocolate, honey and raisins. All in all, rather on the sweet side but never sticky. 

Give MaCallan a sherry cask, and they usually know what they are doing. The price is high, but appropriate. Sure, you could get this from any other distillery for 50 bucks less, but yeah, sometimes you just gotta shill out the extra cash for a fancy bottle and a well known name. 

Well then, cheers people. Let's hope it won't be another couple months until I have time to sit down and do this again...."

4.25,"When drinking an expensive dram, you expect quality and interesting flavors. This great whisky delivers the promise for most part and my score do not reflect what it really is. It is made by maturing it in 16 different ""first filled"" sherry casks.

Bottled 43%abv, polished mahogany color.

On the nose is spectacular: Sherry, Candied fruits, fresh Lemon, Oranges, very perfumed, Coffee, elegant Toffee. Complex yet fruity and lovely.

On the palate is a typical macallan, and dissapoints a little, but it is a solid dram: Strong yet pleasant oak and Orange candy.

Finish is short but spicy, elegant ginger and mint.

My conclusion: it could have been better. A little too straightforward, (i find that sometimes expensive, fancy drams tend to be soft and smooth but not too interesting). Overall it is an 88 over 100, and for the price, only the nose part is worthy."
