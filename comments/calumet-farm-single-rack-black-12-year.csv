3.25,"Caramel & vanilla on the nose.  Very sweet

Palate’s the same, but lesser so.  A bit underwhelming at the beginning, but as it sits it opens up quite a bit.
 
Finish is very short, w/ a mild warming."

Body- corn sweetness comes through with a black pepper spice

4.0,Burn at the end.  Very smooth on the pallet.  Smell of oak.  For 62.00 well worth it.

3.0,"Expected more flavor, does finish with a hint of spice, which fades in the mouth not down the throat.  Pick up hints of banana and oak."
3.75,"Nose is mild but nice, sweet, butterscotch. Taste is nice and balanced, nothing is jumping out it’s just mellow and awesome. Well rounded honey, sweet corn, minty, creme brûlée, toffee. Finish is very pleasant, not overly long, with a little corn sweetness"
