2.25,"My first bourbon. The color is more hazel than golden. A little bit unusual nose. Something cereal and corny. Taste with the same notes, plus sweet and light vanilla. Finish is smooth, sweetness, but a little alcoholic. Probably will be better with ice. Recognizable and advertised bottle design, but I don't like it. Summary: nothing special, suitable for the friend company or if you want to get drunk :)"

1.75,"I'm working through some of the entry level bourbons out of curiosity and I find myself at Jim Beam. I smell sugar and alcohol at first, but take a sip and it turns to a sour wood smell. The first sip is woody and unrefined; it tastes like what it is... cheap bourbon. It might be shot worthy, but sipping my way though it I'm not finding much of interest. I can't see using this in any bourbon forward cocktail. Mixing in ginger beer to cover it up seems to emphasize the rougher aspects of this one without improving it. I can't see ever seeking this one out or drinking it as anything more than a shot with a beer when it's the only option."
2.5,"Nose: weak; vanilla, Apple

Taste: somewhat sweet, vanilla, slight Apple fruit taste

Finish: hint of cinnamon, oak"

2.5,"This review of Jim Beam Original (White Label) is a simple head-to-head tasting against Evan Williams Black Label - two bottom shelf, entry level, budget bourbons that can be found pretty much anywhere.  This head-to-head was inspired by a bar nearby... but that's a tidbit I'll discuss in my subsequent review for EW Black Label.  Let's get to the details of this bottle!

Mash Bill: 75% Corn, 13% Rye, 12% Malted Barley
Age: NAS (but at least 4 years)
ABV: 40%
Price: $9.99 ( typically $10-$17)

Nose: Weak.  Vaguely sweet, watery caramel corn.  Thin vanilla, spice, and herbal notes.  The zest of underripe oranges and some musty undertones reminiscent of peanut shells.  It's so watery, I don't want to say the nose has ""heat"", so let's just say it has more ethanol than I'd like to detect at this proof. 

Palate: Anyone there?  This dram is packed with about as enthusiasm as store brand, budget vanilla ice cream or plain mashed potatoes.  Thin and watery.  The sweetness leans more towards confectioners' sugar than granulated. More watery vanilla, bits of wood, and faint herbal notes. 

Finish: Very short.  Watery caramel, corn, and faint oaky astringency. 

Verdict:  Well, I would pick this over JD.  While that may not be saying much, it costs about half of what JD costs so that's a fair bit of VFM swinging in its favor.  However, as will be detailed in my next review, I would ultimately pick EW Black over this if I had to pick a ~$10 bottle of bourbon.  

2.5 ~ 72 ~ Below Average"

3.25,"Not your typical bourbon. Smells a bit like chemicals, but thankfully that goes away on the taste. VERY light flavor, with a bit of woody bite in the back. It’s kind of impressive how bad this doesn’t taste considering how young it must be. It’s fine in a pinch (which I’m currently in, thanks Covid), but I wouldn’t even want to use it in cocktails, because there’s just no backbone to it."

1.0,"My first Bourbon, didn't like it. On the nose you get acetone, oakyness and a little smoke. On the palate is very hot. Not sweet at all, there are some wine-raising notes there somewhere. Very hoy finish, tends to be alike some Usa whiskeys, where you can find wine-grapes-raising notes on the palate and in the nose but totally inferior. Worst whisky so far"
