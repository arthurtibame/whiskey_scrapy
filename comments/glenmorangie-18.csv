4.25,"Before water, dark chocolate and tree fruit on the nose.  Dark chocolate with a long finish as well as toasted malt with a hint of honey.  After a drop or two of water, the dark chocolate on the nose gives way to malt and tree fruit.  The dark chocolate on the tongue moves to the background and the maltiness moves to the fore.  The honey is more pronounced and central.  There is a strong pepper flavor, more white than black emerges.  A bit of lemon rind and grass?"

4.0,"Beautiful golden color. Nose is rich with oak, vanilla, sweet fruit and caramel notes. Pallet is complex with dried fruit, honey, nuts, more oak, and vanilla flavors. Aftertaste is long with hints of peach, raisins, Sherry, and citrus. A few drops of water opens up more fruit on the nose, and even further rounds the pallet. Overall complex, rich, fruit-dominated character, with nice 18-year old smoothness and clear oak notes from the cask."

4.25,"Super light. I can't believe this is 43%. It's like the original but smoother and even easier to pallet. 

Floral on the nose, buttery on the tongue. Very light up front, a tiny bit of spice in the back. Finish has virtually nothing but a bit of fruit at the end of the finish. 

Not much depth or character. Great as an opening whisky. Easier than the original. Great for sipping by itself."

4.5,"This malt is earthy, full, cinnamon spicy, and delicious. The nose has more ethanol than the taste. If I’ve had any dram that’s classic Highland, it’s this. Smooth as butter, but not in the same way as the Glenlivet 18. This butter has more cinnamon, maple, and oak. The only thing that gives the Quinta Ruban an edge is the long, oily, dark red fruit finish."

4.0,I had the 10 year and was not impressed with the flavors or with the burn it left in my mouth. So I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy the 18 as much as I did. A huge fruit forward nose and taste that was sweet while maintaining an edge to it. A great beginners whiskey they you can sip on for hours.

4.25,"A very wheaty/bready honey sweetness on the nose. It smells bright and floral. Bright fruits on the palate (lots of apple, pear and a tiny bit of orange) with a bit of malt and spice on the finish. The only detractor is the texture, which is a bit thin. Very beautiful dram, that is light and easy to drink, with a decent amount of complexity."
3.75,Sweet fruity/plum or Rainer cherry nose. Fruity start finishes with a barrel or rye spice. Almost no barrel notes.

4.75,"Perhaps I have been too harsh in judging this.  I have offered 3 previous tasting notes, and this is actually totally delicious.  I think maybe I was judging this by what I thought it would be and not what it actually is.  I think for some dumb reason, I was expecting strong elements that come out in the various parts of the cask-finished Glenmorangie.

The nose contains walnuts, almonds, rubbing alcohol, coconut, and perhaps a hint of artificial banana.  Musty wood as an afterthought to an otherwise very clean spirit.

The taste starts with walnuts and cashews and quickly evolves into fudgy dark chocolate followed by a bit of tar and tobacco.  I get sugar cookies or snickerdoodles.  The nutty flavors return in the finish but are melded with woody notes, walnut and pecan shells.  I get a very minty aftertaste- I normally don't like mint in whiskey, but I think that it really works here.  The spirit has a pronounced rubbing alcohol taste, but it's actually very pleasant.  Wood spice and a bit of a spicy bite that reminds me of cloves.  

It's moderately creamy with a lingering spicy finish.  It's very astringent."

Juste WOW!
On aimerait boire plus souvent ce genre de produit, mais à 175$ la bouteille, on se dit qu'on va continuer de le déguster lors de certains événements. Sa puissance mielleuse et épicée nous est restée en bouche un long moment de l'éternité pour notre plein bonheur. Si un jour on vous en offre, dites oui sans hésiter."

4.25,"Neat in a Bowman mini tasting goblet at home.  Nose is sweet and fruity, bringing to mind an Entenmann's mini cherry pie.  Some mild baking spice comes on at the end.  Nice.  Taste has more fruit notes, with apricot, lemon, and cherries; powdered sugar and honey; an interesting sweet spice unfamiliar to me, but lingers well.  This is an excellent dram.  2/4/2020"

3.75,"Very pungent on the nose, sightly syrupy. Floral and sweet with a hint of bitterness. Smooth and easy to drink. Not much fire in the mouth, but a nice burn as it goes down the throat. The fire lingers in the belly nicely."

4.25,"I believe this is a very enjoyable dram. I even think this is one of the best 18yo whiskies i have had, and i truly believe that it should deserve more than the 4.0 im giving it, but it really is a dram that will be forgotten over time. It is just as the glenfiddich 18yo, a kinda fancy, easy drinkable dram, not made for critics (or people like me who believe themselves as whisky critics) because it lacks emotion. 

But it is a very enjoyable dram.

Bottled at 43%abv, amber color. 

On the nose, milk chocolate, Nutmeg, White wine, Vanilla plant, Cake crest, apricot and After a while it develops into creme brulee (burnt caramel).

On the palate, it is very pleasant. Very easy. Spicy clove, Caramel, Apricot Some nuttiness. Oily and oaky but absolutely balanced. Dry vanilla cake. More Clove.

Finish is short, winey and spicy. 

It is almost the twin brother of glenfiddich 18yo (and i truly believe they compete against each other). It is very enjoyable, but not a high scorer. 86 over 100, feels like it could get more, but giving it more would be unfair to more exciting whiskies. This one is to enjoy while sat on a relaxed afternoon. Cheers!"
4.5,Gentle and inviting nose with mild orange and hint of sweetness . Taste starts with an utterly brilliant round full and soft caress to the tongue with lovely citrus and caramel flavors followed by a neat burn free smooth finish with mild oak. If I must pick on it for something there is a slight lingering taste after the finish which is not as refined as the rest of the experience and hence gives away its age. End of the day it’s right up there at this price point. A must try

4.75,"Nose has a sweet orange/orange peel aroma that’s very strong with a hint of oak. Mouth feel is rich and full and smooth. Citrus takes back seat on the taste and vanilla, caramel/creme brûlée’s flavors come out. It’s sweet and creamy with a little bit of a toasty/nutty flavor. Second glass and both times the oak and citrus were strong on the nose and first sips and then the other flavors slowly get stronger as the aforementioned recede. Very complex and delightful"

4.75,"Glenmorangie is a household Scotch name for a reason.  This beautifully full bodied Highlander is exceptional and easily worth double the $100 price tag.  Strong accents of vanilla, orange, chocolate and caramel blend together before a finish of pepper as smooth silk completes the experience."
