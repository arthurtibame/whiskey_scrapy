3.0,"Full bodied, heavy sherry notes. A bit over sweet for a whiskey, almost like a dessert whiskey. A little goes a long way. An interesting dram but a one-off imho"

3.0,"Great big red fruit and soft texture. Though As much as I like this, it's not something I'd want multiple drams of in one sitting. Perhaps a good nightcap with a dark chocolate."

4.0,"Nose - Heavy sherry influence, loads of dark dried stone fruits, almost brandy/cognac like dark grape sweet, caramel bread pudding.
Taste - Tiny hint of chocolaty toasted barley, spiced dark dried stone fruits, roasted nutty sweet, cinnamon spiced sweet white wine, hint of white peppercorn spice.
Finish - Lingering peppercorn spice, residual sweetness of white raisins hydrated in a spiced/mulled wine, light medicinal/herbal finish at the very very end.
Score - 86/100
Final Thoughts - So this is a fairly interesting dram that can be summarized as if you liquefied a bread pudding with lots of juicy raisins. It's tasty, a bit on the sweet side, but kind of a singular flavor profile. I'd say it's more like a dessert dram. I can see this standing up pretty well in a cocktail too, maybe a Rob Roy with chocolate bitters or something. Now if they only fixed how you open the bottle due to the stupid brittle wax & the need for a corkscrew..."

3.0,"Pale gold to brass color. Healthy, fat singular legs. Heavy, musty malt with a touch of raisins on the nose. Overpowering maltiness on the palate, a small background of candied dates and oak spices. Smooth and long finish, a slight bitter after taste. A singular whisky but easy drinking."

3.0,Sweet macaroons: the nutty almond flour provides a good complement to dried apples and a healthy spoonful of honey.
