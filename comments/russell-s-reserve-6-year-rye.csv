4.25,"Smooth smooth, slightly syrupy (in a good way) finish, sweet with a hint of anise/almond. One of the best ryes I’ve had in a long time."

3.0,"Wow, that's some seriously intense caramel on the nose, especially for only 6 years, but I guess that's likely those intense ""alligator"" barrels. This honestly may be tough to distinguish between a rye whiskey and a bourbon if this were a blind tasting. Having said that, the rye can be detected as a smooth, clean fresh grain scent, which, again, is odd considering being aged for some time.

I expected caramel on the taste (even though that doesn't make sense for a rye whiskey), but instead found some burnt sugar and yet a bit of raw oak at the same time. The rye is not as strong as I was hoping for, but then again, I'm not sure what percentage of the mash truly is rye for this one. It definitely is clean, with typical rye notes like grass, cinnamon, and broken bread, but they all ride on a very weak body.

I decided to get this over the single barrel rye to save money and try to find another rye whiskey I was craving, and I can tell the prospects and ideas were good, but the execution doesn't quite land where it should. This is somewhat shocking, given how much strong rye flavor comes through on all of Wild Turkey's products. The proof is probably one of the biggest losses, as I'm sure the rye would come through better with a higher proof blend. I'm almost positive that the single barrel is a higher proof, but this batch isn't enough to get me curious into trying the single barrel for the price point."

4.25,"Nose: Straightforward flavor profile - classic nutmeg, star anise, dill, thyme, rosemary, with some black pepper.  Oak comes through nicely, with barrel char punching through just enough to be interesting.  Lovely stone fruits, maraschino cherries, and whipped cream.

Palate: The herbs and spices on the nose come through mostly as you'd expect.  The oak presents with some great tannin character, while the black pepper sits back a little.  Fruity character is more banana than apricot, with some blueberry, as well.  Milk chocolate, Hershey's style.  Medium-light body.  Finish starts off with a great pop of black pepper and tannin (both flavor and texture)/oak, with strawberry and banana.  Finish slowly fades, giving way to a really nice mint/wintergreen and vanilla bean.  Things stay consistent from there on out.  Medium long finish.

Other notes: This is definitely classic rye but with some excellent depth and complexity.  It doesn't get into super funky territory (Spirit Works Single Barrel, for instance), but still offers exactly what I want.  The age is evident and supports my theory that most rye would be more widely appreciated with just a little more time in the barrel.  If you're into rye (or want to like it), this might just fit the bill.  Solid rebuy potential."

The taste is more pepper and sweetness, with very little oakiness. It's very smooth and the alcohol burn comes in and fades out sharply, and the finish is pretty short. Quite tasty."

4.0,"Colour is surprisingly pale for a straight whiskey, hovering on the light-ish side of amber. Smell is sawdust, big vanilla, and the deli smells I often associate with Wild Turkey: huge caraway seed, a bit of dill, grainy rye, black pepper. A bit of butterscotch/caramel, some candied cherries, some alcoholic fumes. Taste is mellower than expected, though there's some definite spice. More brining spices, a bit of cinnamon, vanilla, wood char. Mint, some green leafy flavour? Peppery here, too, and a finish of dry vanilla, dry wood, and something herbal. Body could be beefed up a bit, but I have no big complaints. This is a versatile whiskey: mellow and compelling enough to sip, but also at home in some of the great classic cocktails."

5.0,"Russell's Reserve Small Batch 6yr Rye

Nose: salty fruit salad, very ripe figs and very ripe warm kiwis, or maybe some Fuji apple banana mandarin orange mix. Either way it's ripe and fruity in an inviting and festive way. No alcohol notes. 

Taste: right away you taste the salty fruit salad, with some dates thrown in, and then comes the rye, big time. The aromatic and bitter rye overtones poignantly expressed in this spirit present as caraway and white carrot, with a savory and pleasantly vegetal sweetness balanced with a similar quality of bitterness. 

Finish: lingering and bitter, herbal, and much like having chewed on fenugreek and bishop's weed and their seeds, with a ""parched"" kind of dry warmth. Here in the aftertaste is where the dry and lightly charred oak shows through after the roar of other pleasant flavors, with a bit of allspice peeking from behind the curtain at the very end... and then an encore of rustically-floral goldenrod, Japanese knotweed, and Queen Anne's lace. 

This drink is all across the board and hits just about every Rye flavor note in cadence, from salt to fruit to cereal to herbal to aromatic to wood to spice to floral. A real treat with incredibly full flavor, easy to drink, an equally easy to chew. 

At LEAST 4.5/5

I will always have to have a bottle of this on my shelf, especially at under $50/bottle."

4.0,"Nose starts off on the right note with and honey, graham cracker, ginger, and orange blossom.  The power of the aroma isn't going to knock your socks off, but an interesting combination to say the least. 

On the palate, this is exactly what I am looking for in a rye; sweet start, spicy finish and not overly herbal. Opens with caraway seeded rye bread, cultured butter, honey, golden raisin, and licorice. Those flavors dance around the tongue for a second and then...whammo everything changes to spice notes of cracked peppercorn, clove, fennel, and just the tinniest hint of dill and eucalyptus. 

Medium length finish turns into soft aged oak and honeysuckle. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, but it compliments the flavor profile well. 

I'm really a fan of this, and enjoyed the journey from sweet to spicy to mildly sweet again. However, as a value standpoint it's not the greatest; not with some of the more budget ryes measuring up fairly well. That said, it's a delight and will most likely be a re-buy for me and I literally cannot wait to try the single barrel version."

3.5,"I like a good rye whiskey I’m partial to them, this is a good rye whiskey. This isn’t a “WOW I’M A RYE WHISKEY”, but it’s a really well balanced and very smooth rye. 

A little on the sweeter side up front in the body with burnt sugars and cinnamon spice, if you search a little you might pick up a little raisin with the char barrel spice, the finish is a little spicy at first but it turns sweetly on the tongue. I guess the description of this for me is it is truly a congenial and not overly complex rye whiskey, it lacks the pizazz I generally expect. 

So even though this isn’t a standout rye for me it is certainly worth a try, completely enjoyable and not disappointing. This is obviously a rye whiskey, but it didn’t hit the “WOW” factor for me. I would’ve put this as a $30 bottle but in my neck of the woods but it hit me for $40. No regrets here mind you, but I can pick up my favorite “R” rye for $28."

3.75,"Grabbing this bottle just to throw some more (hopefully) interesting rye into my collection the 6 year Russells Rye at 90 proof isn't quite a heavy weight barreller but still has a pit of punch to pack and some interesting things going on in the flavor spectrum.   The standard Russells bottle with a promising 6 year age statement in green lettering makes this an inviting bottle just to lay hand on. 

nose:  ginger, fennel, floral honey notes steal the show with some mild vanillins and tangy citrus 

front: caramel sugars and standard peppery rye spice load the front end with some lemon and tart orange bitters joining the barrel char, less cinnamon and red hot sweetness than the nose offers but a good juxtaposition of sharp spice and corn-malt sugars. 

finish: pepper and lemon grass load the back end with a fairly mild charcoal heat all but retiring the sugars and spice. 

Over all this is a good quality of rye, nothing too memorable but having enough body of flavors to make it something you wouldn't want to pass up either.  The smoothness and lack of telltale green youth don't belie the age statement, as this one carries no ""bad habits"".  I'd definitely recommend a tryout at your neighborhood bar and or grab a bottle if you want to spice up  your bar inventory.   Russell's 6 Year Rye, certainly worthy of the name and an undeniable quality rye. 

Cheers.

The nose on this is awesome. Rich bubble gum and fruit punch, raw bread dough along with some rye spice including very faint dill. Light wood and some caramel round it all out. At 90 pf no concerns with ethanol so deep pulls are easy and rewarding. Thin mouthfeel with palate of vanilla caramel, rye spice, more dough and gumminess transitioning to white pepper and parched wood. Finishes short with oak, barley, rye spice and fading sweetness ending dry with spicy kick. I like it but not a lot of weight or depth. For those who prefer less sweet with spicy oak this should hit the spot.........83/100........great nose and decent complexity but too dry for A rating imo.... Still quality product well worth the $33 I paid
Update: Bottle has been open a while now. Started picking up a lovely licorice note on the nose."

3.25,"Color is medium amber, aroma has some caramel, some spice, maybe a hint of nuts, not peanut but a softer and fainter aroma.  Taste is a balance between spice and some sweetness, there is a hint of dryness.  The spice is not overpowering like it can be in other eyes.  The finish tending to fade away pretty quickly.  A very surprising pour for me because I do not consider myself a rye person."
