4.0,"Glengoyne 30 Year

Seems I can’t add the whisky tonight…so I guess I’ll write this and see if distillers ever gets their system to work. It did, but there is an error and the abv is off, 46.8%

Nose – there’s a distinct and strong oak character in this one. Beyond that is dark fruit and yet a sweet and bright malt that’s a bit unexpected. My understanding is that this is a mix of first fill and refilled sherry, unlike the 21 and 25 which are all first fill. I’m also not sure if they use some American oak here instead of exclusive European. It would not surprise me if we have some American oak in here.  

Taste – Oak remains on the flavor, this is really one of the more oak forward scotches I’ve had. The sherry casks of course bring with the oak everything you want from sherry. Dark fruits, raisins, chocolate, plums, and the oak brings spices as well. Just when you think maybe it is a touch oak bitter, the whisky transitions to what almost makes me think juicy fruit and oak along with raisins and brown sugar. 

Glengoyne rarely leads me to writing books, it’s a sherry showcase that in this one brings in a lot of really nice cool oak elements that might put some off. Me this is my wheel house, but their basic malt is fairly simple and with that, you really don’t get a lot for extra depth.

4.0 – outstanding whisky but at 600, I’m not sure outstanding is good enough for most. But I can’t say another bottle won’t be in my future from another batch. The quality is absolutely here."
