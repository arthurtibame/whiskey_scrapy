5.0,"This is a very special bottling. Only available to Glenlivet Guardians! 
Nose: incredible with sweetness of red apples, toffee, floral. Going deeper hints of fudge. 
Palate: unreal. Traditional Glenlivet orange marmalade, very creamy, chocolate, ginger. 
Finish: very long. Sweet. Unreal - bottles at cask strength. Under 300 bottles made ever. If you have a good lad that shares this with you - you're in great company."
