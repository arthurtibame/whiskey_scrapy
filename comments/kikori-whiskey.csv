null,IMHO I wouldn't consider this whisky.  When I do it tastes horrible.

null,"I didn't put any stars on this one.  I've never had any rice based whiskey, not sure what's considered good, and I think it would be unfair to compare it to a Scottish , Indian, or  American whiskey or any malt based blend.   The nose is clean, like fresh linen drying outside over a bed of flowers.   Taste  is floral, light, crisp.  Reminded me of something like a citrus Sprite or 7up, minus the fizz.   Pear, fresh flowers.   Finish is really rough, definately young.   It's unique.  I have a feeling this was originally made for mixing, rather than having with a bit of water or ice.  Either way, it's different, and can be a welcome (and reasonably priced) change from barley based single malts or blends.  Would I buy again (as I would a Midwinter, Compass Box anything, Ardbeg 10, etc) ?   Probably not.  Was interesting to try, but not a top notch staple I'd have on my shelf."
5.0,"Delicious! A light, versatile whiskey that is amazing in a cocktail"

5.0,"Wonderfully light and elegant--floral notes and tree fruits on the nose, backed with tart green apple, vanilla and root beer candy flavors. A quick bit of heat before a clean finish. Great in cocktails or neat--add an ice cube and watch the caramel come out of the American Oak and the nutty honey notes come out of the Sheery casks! A delightful whiskey that is not trying to emulate Single Malt Scotch Whisky but rather representing something truly unique to Japan! A+"

null,I'd say this is closer to Shochu than Whiskey. Usually my go to Shochu is Ichiko but I may try this again. Also fun that that is made where my family is from.

5.0,Very approachable and  mixable whiskey. Great value for the price.  A softer and Clean whiskey that is  very satisfying.
4.0,"Kikori kind of blew my mind... It wasn't at all what I was expecting. I usually collect more bold, heavy whiskies. But Kikori is much more delicate and bright, so it is adding a whole other range to my whisky collection. It's clean and smooth with light citrus and floral notes, so I love it for a day or summer sipper on a rock. I've also been using this in cocktails -- makes a great lighter version of an Old Fashioned. Also, why wouldn't Japanese whiskey be made from rice? Would love to see more of this..."

3.75,My First Rice Single Grain. A splash of Pellegrino (10mg Na)mineral water  brings out the fruity and “nutty-ness”. This whiskEy will grow on me if I am patient...

4.0,Clean smell and taste. Extremely refreshing. The nose hints at cherry blossoms. The taste is a light citrus with no sharp edges.

3.0,"Should be 2.5.  Too light, slight Smokey flavor"
3.5,"Not much on the nose. Very light straw color. A little hotter than the 82 proof would suggest. Smooth with a velvety mouthfeel. Floral, light citrus and moldy wood flavor profile. Subtle peach and lemon zest on later taste. 3.4."

2.75,Had this leftover from a family tasting last year and decided to revisit. Would agree with others on the similarity to shochu. Wouldn’t likely buy another bottle or pour but interesting to try nonetheless.

3.75,"It is not your usual whisky, but not bad. Your expectations need to be altered to enjoy it. My first taste was somewhat unpleasant, because I was not expecting what I was getting. It had a saki flavor and a flower like smell- not a usual whisky. It had no peat smokiness or wood taste. My second try, I was ready. I enjoyed the smoother refreshing taste. I visualized clean running spring water. A light delicate whisky with flavors of rice and may be blossoms?"
