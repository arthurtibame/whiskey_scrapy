4.0,"Ah, Tomatin.  This distillery has quietly crept up my list of favorites based on some serious, high quality drams that won’t break the bank.  You can find some tasty drams ranging from the NAS Cu Bocan to the 12 year French Oak to the 14 Year Port Finished to the 18 year sherry cask.  Most of these bottles also run in the $45-60 range.  I believe the 18 can be had for less than $80.  There’s serious value there.

This bottling is the single cask, cask strength version of the sherry-finished 12 year old.  This particular one was selected by the fine fellows over at Ace Spirits in Minnesota.  This is cask number 1833 and is bottle #24 of a scant 210 total.  I bought this for the meager sum of $43 online.  It’s 53.1% ABV, distilled in 2002 and bottled in 2014.  It’s a very pale yellow in the Glencairn and remains clingy and oily even when you get sort of violent with it.

The nose is fresh cut oak, vanilla beans with some faint sherry notes that struggle to get past the heat from the high ABV.  The palate reminded me of fresh cut, yellow pine from when I worked in a local lumber yard while in my teens.  The sawdust always found it’s way home with me and that smell haunts me from time to time, especially when I drink American bourbon.  It’s here in spades, as well.  There’s a nice wash of sherry sweetness on the tail end and into the finish which save this from being a total power play of oak and heat.  The finish is somewhat long, oaky and hot without being too harsh.  It’s not complex, but I think it’s pretty enjoyable and better than the regular 12 year old.

I hope the other guys in the distillery tour group find this one enjoyable, as my last few contributions have been mostly busts.  I enjoyed it and recommend it, especially for the bourbon fans out there.  It’s a solid bridge builder in the world of single malt scotches.  3.5-3.75 stars, with a bit of a boost for the price point.  Cheers."

3.0,"A Stressful day at work and what now appears will be consuming my weekend.  Ahh, but a momentary pause from the chaos (KAOS) of work; so I grab a sample from the group the @LeeEvolved has presented. 

The nose is floral with damp saw dust. Throw in some apple crumb pie with some vanilla cream soda.  A nutty aroma comes through, though faintly, and after a good deal of time. The nose is quite enjoyable and simply soothing. 

The palate receives a thin bodied spirit. A flash of vanilla sweetness that gives way to a peppery spiciness.  A bit of lemon zest come through, and as it fades with a bit of ground cinnamon. Fades, warmingly. 

A short finish of lemon oil, wood drying oak tannins. 

A fine, unassuming whisky that is a good everyday-er.  It’s not going to wow, but it will not disappoint, especially the price.  [83/100][Tasted: 1/26/18]"
3.0,"Nose: can smell the abv
Palate: really good. Strong and has a burn, as expected. Burnt sugar/caramel and chestnut. Evaporated from tongue to leave a gentle heat."
2.0,"hell goldene Farbe. Stark alkoholisch im Geruch, aber mit feinen Karamell und Fruchtnoten(Erdbeere?). Alkoholisch bissig, aber dann milder frucht und Karamellgeschmack. Wird immer milder im Abgang."
3.0,"Strong herbal and oak notes smack you on the nose. It may not be a complex whisky, but the first fill bourbon/oloroso sherry casks are a real treat. Pine trees and lemon make their way in. The palate brings more woody notes, vanilla, and caramel. I wish the sherry had more of a presence here. Maybe a PX instead of oloroso, but it's still a solid foundation of the distillery. If I was more of a bourbon fan, I bet I'd REALLY be into this glass more though. 53.1% ABV is fun to play with, so this is a fun scotch too. I also think this one might be good to do some self blending experiments. The finish was dry, but medium. I am looking at a 3.25. Thanks so much Lee for the opportunity, and I am already looking forward to trying their 18 soon. The theme of this dram should be something woody...oaky... ""The Trees"" by Rush is a good fit."
3.0,"Stop number 56 on the SDT is Tomatin. Tomatin is a Highland distillery known for producing good single malts at a spectacular price. This 12 year old is a cask strength, single cask hand picked by the liquor super store Ace Spirits in Minnesota. Cask number 1833, bottle number 24 of 210. Distilled in 2002, bottled in 2014. 53.1% ABV and being cask strength I would venture a guess that it is non chill filtered and natural color. This is a light golden straw. I’ve tried 3 Tomatin 12 year olds before, the older sherry finished version, the newer “Bourbon and Sherry Cask” version, and the limited French Oak version. Let’s see how this one compares. 

Heavy floral notes dominate the nose, so much so that I immediately likened it to a barrel aged gin. Light oak, pine and a lemony citrus. Seriously gin-like. Vanilla custard, very light butterscotch and toffee. A candy like sweetness emerges, but its weak and covered in flower petals. After a good long while in the glass some sherry notes appear in the form of a maple syrup like sweetness. A tad nutty with some pears and cinnamon. Decided to add water to see if the higher ABV was masking everything I remember from the standard 12. Water adds more sherry oak and fruit and some honey comes in, but it does nothing to tame the heavy floral notes. 

Like the nose, the palate has a huge floral hit up front. Again, very gin-like. Peppery sherried oak and a lemon/pine citrus. Cinnamon, pears and little bitterness. Water drowns out everything but the floral and pine notes, making it feel even more like a gin. 

Medium to full bodied mouthfeel. A light oiliness, mouth coating and mouthwatering. 
The finish is quite short, floral, a touch bitter and dry. 

This is so very different than the other 12 year olds I’ve had from Tomatin. It’s also a disappointment as far as cask strength scotches go. Hard to rate this one as it doesn’t really feel like a scotch. More like a scotch-gin hybrid. Well priced for a single cask, cask strength though at only $43, which is only $10 more than their standard 12 version, but it’s just not what I’m looking for in a scotch. A solid 3. Thanks for the sample Lee, it was a unique experience for sure. 
Cheers"

3.25,"The strong alcohol content is well perceptible on the nose, without being annoying, on the contrary supporting a beautiful herbaceous and balsamic freshness, with aromas of amaretto, lemon zest, peach, pineapple, candied orange, sugar glaze. Malt is very present, with a certain hint of yeast. I would say, quite young.
The alcoholic blow on the palate is understandably tough, but not very balanced: the aromas of Tomatin usually are not so strong, but here they are really turned off by the gradation. Still a lot of malt, accompanied by cinnamon, raisins, pineapple, mango and a touch of citrus. The aromas struggle to emerge, burn quickly and leaving only alcohol and wood.
Medium finish, alcoholic and astringent, of malt, wood and cinnamon.
Cask strength bottlings attract a certain slice of the market, but it is not like that you have to chase them at all costs, and above all you need to know how to create them. The alcohol here asphalts everything, revealing the inadequacy of Tomatin's more than good whiskies to support this high alcohol content. Perhaps a more decisive aging would benefit, but this is defintely not the case: you appreciated just the smell (from which it can be inferred it could do better), but they can do much more."

4.25,"While at a Tomatin tasting, I chose this scotch as the best value in their line up. Being cask strength, the flavors are rich and strong,and there is no foul ethanol aromas or burn.

As you would expect, this whisky had the strongest nose compared to the other bottles we tasted (the Dualchas, 12, 14, 15, & 18) The dominating flavors on the nose were lemon zest and butterscotch, along with less powerful notes of cream and flowers. 

The palate is sweet, complex, and very strong with cream cheese, lemon, and fresh cut grass. The finish was long and sweet with some spices creating in and some pepper on the tongue. It may sound strange but this scotch is similar to a jalapeño popper. 

I only had one taste and drank mine without adding water, but if you did have time to add water I’m sure you would discover even more great flavors."

4.0,"A hidden gem. Tobacco leaf, earth, sherry cask finish. High proof that does not diminish flavor in any way. Big bold and delicious"
2.75,"Au nez : colle pvc, saucisse aux herbes au barbecue, vernis à ongles, terreux, acide, pomme puis vient une légère noisette et en fin de compte l’amande du sherry
Au palais : fort et agressif, feu profond et froid, âpre et tanique, floral, noisette/amande du sherry , légèrement médicinal
La finale est légèrement tanique et alcoolisées et manque de saveur si ce n’est une touche lointaine de noisette et un arrière goût métallique

Avec une goutte d’eau :le nez tient un peu plus du sherry mais le palais n’est pas beaucoup plus agréable ni complexe, il est juste moins fort

 Note personnelle : 74/100

Un Cask strength bien trop jeune à mon goût, qui ne donne même pas autant de saveur qu’un 43 ou 46 abv, alors que cela devrait être l’inverse, ce whisky se retrouve donc juste chargé presque inutilement d’alcool. Le diluer n’y change rien, pas de complexité et presque parfois désagréable.
Il est néanmoins sauvé par son nez intéressant, singulier et agréable."
