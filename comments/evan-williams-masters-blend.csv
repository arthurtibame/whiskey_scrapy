4.25,"So I’ve been drinking but I’ll keep it short and sweet !
So the nose is sweet got some caramel and a hint of oak
The palate: oak is present immediately with tons of caramel and butterscotch !honestly it’s surprisingly good and smooth!
I know smooth isn’t a word to describe something however this is such a caramel and butterscotch bomb it’s anything but harsh !
Finish: sweet as hell and amazingly butterscotch that hugs you the whole way 
If price isn’t included this is a very rare 92!!!!!
I can name on one hand the bourbons that hit the 90’s"
4.25,Incredibly smooth and Rich. Ready to sip. Only available at their Experience in Louisville.
