4.0,"I'd been wanting to try this, a limited run OP, but had balked at paying $10 over the price of the 12 yr for an NAS (my rule of thumb: NAS is OK as long as you price it fairly). Then, I got a $10 off coupon from my local fine spirits purveyor and figured why not get a bottle since the stocks of it are starting to run low. It's very obviously Old Pulteney from the first whiff on - that rich, fruity character comes to the forefront, this time with an apple overtone. There's also a savory olive note, some raisins, a bit of vanilla, and even a little chocolate; the only OP staple not that's not strong here for me is citrus. That said, there is some lemony brightness on the palate, along with crisp fresh fruit, a little bit of salt, and some vanilla...plus the inevitable heat from this being (presumably) a young-ish whisky. I think it's a bit silly to price this above the 12 year, but it still has enough to commend itself to warrant positive marks. I just wish it cost less; if it were priced more competitively, it could actually serve as a decent introduction to the distillery for the budget-minded."

3.0,"Nose: Sweet salty licorice.
Taste: Salty malty, light peat - not too strong. finishes quickly without much linger."
