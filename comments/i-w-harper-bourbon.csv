4.0,"A distinct perfume - no, really, the scent is so floral the first thing I wanted to do was put it behind my ear. This is wonderful if you enjoy flower notes the way I do. Taste follows suit; ""roses!"" is the impression throughout."
5.0,An extraordinary taste

3.0,Tried at Public House.  Sweet but alcohol strong.  Not great but good.  Too pricey and the age didn't help it.

5.0,I used to get this at duty free in Tokyo not knowing that it was unavailable in North America. A pleasant well rounded bourbon. Definitely floral as other notes suggest. Nice to see that it's making appearances closer to home once again.

4.0,"A very smooth bourbon, lots of caramel and banana on the nose and in the palate with some sour prunes also present. You can drink this one easily. Nothing to die for  but not a bad dram at all. 

Butterscotch also present in the palate. The bottle is actually very pretty, like a cologne decanter. Overall, 80 over 100."

2.0,"Had a sample bottle from the 60s/70s.

Nose: rather strong newmake perfume, but somehow also rounded. Floral. Honey. Heather.

Palate: Honey, marshmallow, slight oak, nuttiness.

Finish: Alcohol sting, floral perfume, moderately long.

Not keen to have another, even if given for free."

2.25,I mostly taste wood and burn. Tastes kinda young but not the worst I've had.
