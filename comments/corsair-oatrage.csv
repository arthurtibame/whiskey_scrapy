3.75,"It smells kind of like a hotel room: bland and stuffy, needing to be aired out. It's a unique smell. There's something a little sour going on too, which is also like a hotel, but there's a little mesquite mixed in too, which I guess is like a hotel that someone microwaved something spicy in and then didn't get aired out. The oatmeal scent is definitely noticeable. The palate is this weird flavor, with spicy cinnamon and a bunch of smoke playing with this weird oatmeal flavor. What in the world is this? There is a lot of alcohol, but the richness of of the paper-like oatmeal and the spicy other flavors balance it out. It doesn't have much that could be compared with malted barley, but there is some vanilla standing its ground. There's a smooth chocolatey backing that blends with everything like a a trombone in a jazz band playing in a speakeasy. It leaves a smokey note, but when you take another sip some nice cherry and pumpernickel stand out. This is complex in a jazzy way: it isn't bad, but it isn't that comforting usual complexity. It throws me off and makes me think about it. This is possibly the most interesting whiskey I have ever tasted. Props to Corsair for making such a unique drink. I enjoy it as a novelty, but I'm just not sure I enjoy it in its own right. I appreciate the creaminess, but it tastes like fake cream that is made of paper and sold to poor people. Arguably, it shifts from the 1920s to the 1930s in an artistic representation of the foolish nativity of humanity. The complexity is terrific and the flavors land. I am not a huge jazz fan and so that leaves me puzzled. I appreciate how different and well-executed it is though, so I'll give it high marks. In a first, I'll label this a sipper worth pondering. There's a bit of befuddling tobacco in here that I am having trouble making sense of. This is a work of art, but not perhaps a daily pleasure. This might actually be better with a little less alcohol to let the other flavors shine. I dunno, this drink has done me in. I can't explain it, but I want to keep trying. That underlying creamy sweetness is a tempting flavor that makes me willing to keep opening myself to the other flavors that challenge my notions of what whiskey is. Everything balances in this way that pushes at the boundaries of my preconceived notions of what should be acceptable. It's quite a feat. I still don't love drinking this, but I do sure appreciate its subtlety. Hints of chai dance through with other spices like cinnamon and a little tiny bit of cardamom or maybe corriander. The richness is wonderful. There's definitely some coffee hanging out with this chocolate."

3.5,"I love stout beer; therefore, I love this whiskey. Chocolate, oatmeal, espresso notes are immediate. However, it follows with a dry, oaky, youthful taste. Delicious, but constantly taking another sip to taste the flavors expressed in the beginning. The taste does not express the high price, but it’s uniqueness and care does."

3.0,"Worth a try!
Nose is fresh. Could be the lemon others have suggested.

Oat is present on the pallet. Mouthfeel is dry. A few drops of water changed the feel and opened up a few new flavors. 

Finish is pleasing."
3.75,"Nose: cake malt, lemon, oats, light cream, brown sugar, apple, cherry, 

Taste: light coffee, cinnamon, brown sugar, maraschino cherries, red apple

Dry mouthfeel and aftertaste. Water brings out more of the actual oat notes while adding some oak and increasing the maltiness. Really surprised how much this tastes like a bourbon. Definitely could be used for sweeter cocktails."

null,Young tasting. Decent balance. Heavy roasted malt has a distinct Guinness/coffee taste! Best one that we tried at the Brewstillery in Nashville. Their Kolsch on top made for a perfect beer 'n a bump!!!
