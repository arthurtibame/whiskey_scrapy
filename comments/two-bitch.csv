3.0,Bland and boring
4.0,"A strong take on classic bourbons. It comes forward with many classic characteristics of many bourbons such as cherry, DEFINITELY brown sugar, and a slight tannen note.  However it tunes them up to a level that the next door neighbors can hear, and were talking about the benchmark.  When I'm in Nevada and see Two Bitch, I'm calling for it. I would go so far as to say one of the best distilleries in Nevada as of now."

3.25,Smooth finish but a bit sweet.  Maybe a good after dinner sipping bourbon.
