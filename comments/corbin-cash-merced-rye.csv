4.0,"Buy a bottle immediately. This is an incredible rye whiskey that delivers numerous layers in each sip. You will smell berries and pepper on the nose. The initial swig is clean and sweet but it's followed quickly by a perfect rye heat. When you open your mouth to breath, you'll get a clean finish of gorgeous floral notes and grass. Just awesome!!"

4.0,"Full Disclosure: I had to look up what Merced Rye was. Turns out, it's a brilliant idea. 

On the nose, you'll first find fresh fields followed by strong vanilla, caramel and fudge. Take a few moments to breathe this one in. There are layers to find and if you like sweets, they just keep coming out of the woodwork. That sweet aroma is is trailed by mild heat as it rounds out your entire mouth. This is a full experience from beginning to end. Dried nuts, and a distinctive almond profile say their last goodbyes as you wait between sips. 

One should appreciate a fine whiskey that can walk that perfect line of lingering on the back end, especially when the notes are well defined on every level up to that point (FWF share #35).
