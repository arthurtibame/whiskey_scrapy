Imagine taking that, and then adding a layer of tropical fruits like mangoes, kiwi, and passionfruit.  Truly unique and singular.   The closest similarity I can think of for this is like having pasta with shavings of black truffle, followed by a mango cheesecake dessert.  Thankful to have tried a wee sample this afternoon's at a friend's for Christmas lunch.  Also, apparently, this is only available in Japan, and that too a mere 500 bottles."
