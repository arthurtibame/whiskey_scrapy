3.5,"Initial buttery flavor, barely a hint of sweet but it’s there just at first, followed by some peppery, slight smoky aftertaste."
3.0,"Heavy smell with hints of caramel, honey, almonds. Less sweet on taste with more bitterness. Finish is kinda bad."

4.0,"Peg Leg Porker is Dickel sourced and, according to the founder of the company, does not get the Lincoln County Process before barreling. After batching, it is filtered through Hickory Charcoal produced at Carey Bringle's Nashville based BBQ restaurant of the same name. As a NC native, there are few things I like more than good smoked pork BBQ. Let's see how it is.
NOSE: When popping the cork, the Dickel nose jumps right out of the bottle, but with the welcome addition of Hickory Smoke. It's like enjoying a pour of Dickel 12 while outside tending the smoker. Pours into my Glencairn the color of lightly stained Cherry Wood. The nose begins as Corn and Hickory Smoked Meat. If you're a cigar smoker, it's reminiscent of a Kentucky Fire Cured Cigar. There are hints of Fresh Mint Leaves and Vanilla. There is a mystery note that I couldn't place. I read another review (thanks, @Ian-Young) and they nailed it. The smell you get when you open one of those movie theater boxes of Sweet Tarts. This one starts out one dimensional, but opens up with time. THIS is what I was expecting from Longbranch.
NEAT: Light and Thin, but also Oily and Buttery. It's all Sweet Mint and Vanilla on the front. Mid-palate gets the wood-driven notes of charred Oak and Hickory. The Smoked Pork shows up on the backend. It has a slight Black Peppery Taste and Tingle with a touch of Astringency. There is little to no burn on the finish. It leaves a coating of Light Vanilla and Ash. 
SPLASH: A little water accentuates the Vanilla and the Hickory Smoke on the palate but has little effect on the nose.
VERDICT: I loved this! As both a Cascade Hollow Fanboy and a lover of good BBQ, this was the best of both worlds for me. It was interesting to experience Dickel sans the LCP, and the Hickory Charcoal filtering really shows up in the finished product. It's like 'MURICAN PEAT. The Hickory did for this, what I had hoped the Mesquite filtering would've done for Longbranch. If I were to nitpick here, I would maybe ask for a slightly higher proof? Otherwise, it's an enthusiastic 4!"

3.75,Good nose. Pallet is buttery on the tongue with a small burn. Finish is satisfying and not too long.
3.75,"Very light front end, lots of butter. The finish has a little burn, but just enough to keep you sipping more. Very easy to drink, the finish lasts a while. Isn’t as big as the 45 abv would lead you to believe."
3.25,Very mild up front but has some serious back end bite.  No notable Flavors.
3.5,Kind of smoked pork or bacon vibe.
3.5,"Smooth, Notes of cherry"

3.75,"Smokey, bbq flavors and sweet. Some vanilla in the finish."
3.75,Faintly smoky in a nice way. A bit like making out with a twink who got high before he came over.

3.5,"Easy on the front end, smoky middle with hints of perhaps applewood, spicy burn finish that doesn’t linger too long."
