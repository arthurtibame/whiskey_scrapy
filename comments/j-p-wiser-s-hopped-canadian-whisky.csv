3.5,"I can't believe I am reviewing a flavoured whisky. That said, this is a tasty expression. The hop adds some citrus and a significant amount of chocolate to this one. Brown sugar, molasses and cream chocolate sugar candy. This is too sweet for a regular pour, but it is a dessert in a bottle if that is what you are looking for."

3.0,3 1/2 stars. Rich. Caramel forward. Quite sweet. Ice cream in a glass. But delicious.
