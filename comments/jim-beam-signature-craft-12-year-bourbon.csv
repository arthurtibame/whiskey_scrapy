4.25,"Creamy and balanced.  The time in the barrel has given this a more complex profile than younger JB products.  The lower proof probably helped to tame some of the barrel influence in this and smooth it out, and the proofing has resulted in a very good pour to savor when you aren't in the mood to be smacked in the face with intensity.  Glad I found it, and found it on sale."
4.25,"I recently finished a bottle of this liquid and it is very good but not great. I really wanted to like this Bourbon and tried it neat, on the rocks, and in an Old Fashioned and it nice but did not knock my socks off especially for the price. I liked the taste it was not too hot neat and it opened up very nicely on the rocks but it did not have the full rounded flavor of Henry McKenna BiB or David Nicholson Reserve and yes I know they are a higher proof but this Bourbon just tasted thin. Still, it is not a bad drink but it is very close to JB Black or the Repeal Batch but at a higher price. If I find this on sale I would buy it again but at this price point, it is now a pass for me. If you like Jim Beam products then this is going to make you happy but it is just not my glass of Bourbon."

2.75,Little rough and unrefined.  Heat on finish
3.75,"Nose: Chloroform (or some other sort of sweet smelling solvent), plywood, pencil shavings, vanilla, mango cream, grilled pineapple, orange syrup, honey and a light hint of smoke. Over time the nose is dominated by orange blossom honey and vanilla.

Palate: Sweet and creamy arrival with caramel fudge and light corn syrup flavours. The development brings out a little very mild rye spice, vanilla, honey and oak. The texture is good, but not outstanding and it can occasionally seem a little spirity.

Finish: Medium. Honey, crème brûlée and a slightly bitter mocha coffee note. Just after the finish seems to have ended there is an aftertaste of sweet oak.

A very soft, well balanced and easy to sip bourbon. The sweet and spice characteristics are finely matched throughout with fruity and cereal notes in support. The nose is fragrant and alluring and the finish lasts a good deal  longer than expected. There is a vanilla presence in both the nose and palate that borders on being too dominant, and the longer you taste it the more obvious it becomes, but it never gets to the point of being cloying.

Overall I'd describe this as ""genteel"" in profile.  It's very much the Jim Beam house profile done just the right way at low proof and it wouldn't be inaccurate to describe this as a more refined Jim Beam White Label. It lacks the verve and punch of Jim Beam Bonded (which is THE value buy from Beam), and it has nothing like the commanding personality of the more expensive whiskies from this distillery.

Nevertheless I'm enjoying this highly approachable liquor and it works equally well as a neat sipper, over ice, with a little water and even as a long drink in cola - although in this last form it does become a little too sweet and creamy.

I am, however, at a complete loss regarding the official rating here, particularly in light of the official notes, which do not seem to be in agreement. 95 is an absurd score for this whiskey - maybe it was a typo and supposed to be 85?  That would be a little harsh as a rating but far more believable.

""Good"" : 3.75 stars"

5.0,"Damn fine bourbon. Changed my tune about Jim Beam forever.

Had this again on site in Fall of 2014 during NAILE. Oak spice is mellowed by charcoal, vanilla sweetness and something tangy (apples?). Buy often and keep stocked. This is something that would truly be missed if it was removed from the market. Don't buy it on site, though, because it is marked up about 20%."

3.0,"The low-ish ABV hurts this one, but as someone who's normally antagonistic toward the Beam flavour profile, I have to admit I actually kind of enjoyed it: twelve years in oak help to add a bit more dimension and flavour to complement (if not outright mask) the funky-nutty Beam yeast. Flavours here of peanut butter, earthy nuttiness, hot roasted peanuts, cinnamon, vanilla, leather, corn husk. Gravel, cherry, raspberry. Chocolate, something vinous. Tastes a bit like Nerds candy. Stone fruits, cinnamon, vanilla. Fairly dry, tobacco. The finish is the only point at which this stuff feels a bit over-oaked, bitter, and tannic. But in general the Beam Signature Craft does wear its twelve years of ageing pretty well."

4.0,"Two notes:  I usually despise the traditional 100 point rating system, and was very pleased to see Drink Distiller go with a 5-star format.  Unfortunately, sometimes the expanded room for rating would be prudent, and this is one of those instances.  It's better than 80% (4 out of 5), but it's certainly not perfect.  If I had a 10-point scale it would be a solid 9.  Unfortunately, the scale requires me to leave it the same as it's much less-smooth brother, the 8-yr aged Double Black.  Rest assured...this whisky is a helluva lot better than the Double Black.
Point 2:  This whisky changes flavors significantly based on glass type.  The Glencairn shows a lot more on the nose, but also washes out the aroma with alcohol burn.  Taste is similar, with the Glencairn amplifying that which is found in a traditional rocks glass while bringing forward a lot more wood and char.  I much prefer this from a square rocks glass, but in the name of consistency, this review is from a Glencairn glass.

The nose is rich with toffee, vanilla and oak.  After sitting for 5 minutes, it opens up a little and you can detect a bit of mint as well.  The palate is rich and creamy, with vanilla leading the charge.  Molasses and brown sugar follow right behind before a swift kick of wood and spice finish things up.  The finish is drying, with more wood and a hint of smoke before the astringency leaves a polite numbness on your lips and gums.  This is a great bourbon at most any reasonable price, and for $40-odd a fifth, it's exceptional.  If you haven't tried it yet, do yourself a favor and grab a bottle.  Or three."

3.0,"A friend of mine received this bottle as a birthday gift. On that very moment, we decided to crack this bottle open and give it a try. Poured some Jim Beam to a couple shot cups and here we are:
Aroma: The aroma is very rich, with a great profile of vanilla. Just in the back, there lays the hints of malts and the expressionist alcohol, which I find a bit too expressive.
Taste: The senses here find some spiciness, peaty tones and just a minor profile of malts.
Mouthfeel: Currently I'm still learning a few things of bourbon but this is too hot either in mouth and in throat. I do not like this behavior. For me, it should be really smooth on mouth and only then it can catch 'fire'.
Overall: This is probably my first reasonable bourbon. Not my favorite stuff but I'll just keep on learning."

I get a hint of coffee, some bitterness. Some spice lingers. I sense that there's more, but it seems like it's constricted, like the bottle needs some air time to open up and release the flavors underneath. 7/26/17
  All the above, with strong caramel and the addition of buttered bread. The acidic notes are still strong and for me that holds this back. 9/25/17 
Great nose. This time I also get some additional earthy notes on the nose, something like mushrooms or truffles. The wood notes are still strong. On the palate, the sharp acidic bite is still there. Some turpentine and dark chocolate bitterness at the end. 12/16/17"

This is by far the sweetest Beam product I have had! You can really taste the barrel char coming out and showcasing it's age. Initially it's all sweet vanilla and toffee. As that recedes you then get the oak notes with some tobacco and a pleasant spice swell on a medium to long finish. I really am enjoying this dram. Not overly complex,but a very nice sipper. Pretty bold for the lower proof as well. All in all I would certainly buy another pour and honestly wouldn't mind owning a bottle. Maybe not a daily pour as it's pretty sweet (think Baker's but sweeter!)but a nice change of pace for sure! Yet another winner for the Beam portfolio."

Taste: This whisk(e)y taste is refined. It has a better than moderate/typical flavor profile. It has a creamy/oily density to the body and it's a well balanced. This is a very smooth pour with some big bold oak notes in this 12 yr. old pour but it's a symphony that's in tune and in tempo and that oak is the crescendo.   I don't see anything I don't like in this pour.    This is a more advanced pour then average drams and has a good balance between sweetness and dryness but leans more towards the sweet-side.  No burn noticed either!

Notes detected include:  Cinnamon, Rye, Apple, Orange blossoms, Fresh cut oak, Tons of Butterscotch/Carmel, Honey, Maple Syrup, Tobacco, Vanilla.  The nose for this is amazing.  My only negative (of sorts)… the finish for this whisk(e)y is medium but overall one of the more pleasant pours I've had this week!

Tongue: This isn't your grandpa's beam. It's more complex, so smooth. Hints of Caramel and vanilla are quickly overtaken by the oak char. Not overly spicy, and a sweet note. It really good.

Finish: I don't get a lot of burn, which is good for me. It leaves a nice oaky taste, but not oily. It quickly disappears making you want another drink.

If you get a chance, definitely have a little, it's well worth it. I have enjoyed it quite a bit."
