5.0,"Got a tiny sample of this from a friend and it is out of this world! The best I’ve ever tried. The nose is full of plums, sandalwood, cherry blossoms, pepper, lychee, floral notes, and chocolate. The palate has notes of plums, raisins, red fruits, toffee, chocolate, and spices along with a long spicy chocolate raisin finish."
