4.0,"I recently attended a tasting of this distillery where I tried their 10,12,15,18,21 and their cask strength expressions.There is some sweet spiciness to the nose, sort of like a cinnamon covered pastry. On the palate I got some floral/ dried fruit notes up front followed by spiciness and vanilla notes. It has a medium finish which brings out a lot of oak (cask) influence. It does have a Christmas character to it which would make this a great dessert dram. This is a fantastic scotch at a somewhat affordable price."

5.0,"Nose - Dark heavily dried stone fruits, sweet tobacco, leather, dark chocolate mocha, icewine like sweetness.

Taste - Dark plums stewed with cinnamon/nutmeg in a sweet moscato/riesling, cocoa nibs, cinnamon spice, lightly fruity/bitter like a cider pressed with skins/cores, white pepper heat, a bit thin on the mouthfeel.

Finish - Lingering dark stone fruit sweetness, fruity bitter cider, lingering cinnamon spice, long lasting, mouth drying finish.

Score - 91/100

Final Thoughts - This one had a wonderful nose, you could immediately tell that it was a heavily sherried malt. Once it hit the tongue, it felt like a lower proof dram, but the flavors were definitely not dialed down at all. Full flavored just like the nose. No off putting notes. The bitterness plays nicely with the sweet to balance it out so it's not cloyingly sweet. Finish is where I wish this held up a bit better in that it is long lasting, but the sweetness fades a lot faster than the bitterness so you're left with this somewhat fruity bitter apple/grape seed bitterness."
4.0,"A very good whisky, with a powerful, syrupy sherried and oaky flavor - but with lingering wood bitterness and somewhat lacking in subtlety. Golden promise malt has a strong flavor and high viscosity - too strong I venture"

4.0,Two bottles in my collection one for drinking on special occasions one for later in life excellent dram worth the 160 x 2.
4.0,"A strong sherry presence, with almonds, cooked raisins, and cinnamon on the nose. The palate is quite whiny though not a ""sherry bomb"", with a syrupy texture and full body. There's wood spices and a touch of oak on the finish, with an aftertaste that is quite long.

Very similar to the Glendronach 21 Parliament."

En bouche, c'est très rond aussi, une complexité incroyable, ça part dans tous les sens. C'est sucré mais très subtilement, comme sucré par du fruit cuit, encore de la banane flambée. Ça ne monte pas très haut mais c'est une parfaite harmonie guidée par une touche de cerise confite.
La finale est malade, bien sucrée dans la bouche mais aucunement agressive. WOW!"

null,"Bought a bottle of this - ... so let me start by saying it has a wonderful nose for scotch - right off the bat it has an extensive array of aromas floating out of the glass, very pleasant and unexpected. ... the palate has citrus, light sweetness, and green apple notes. However, for “21 years”, ...idk - it has a hell of a bite, very spicy and lacks smoothness - if anything; where I know smoothness to be at this age - I found it to be watery and light - even after a mean onset of spice; it fades quickly into watery instead of oily. This scotch reminds me of what might be a center cut version of King Robert - and IMO it feels more like a watered down 14 year scotch than a 21. I’m not disappointed, I’m just now wowed. I heard this was comparable to a macallan 18-... not. even. close. BUD.; the Mac is many time smoother, balanced, and has an amazing mouth feel- unlike this. 

I don’t want you think this is a bottle kill review - but I have my doubts about the authenticity of the age statement on the liquid itself - and it’s definitely not for the macallan lovers- it’s more for fans of glenmorangie 18 or Glenfiddich 12."

5.0,"This is the first Glengoyne I taste and certainly not the last, as this is a beautiful expression:

Nose: The initial smell is terrific. First I get cinnamon, all spice and then the sherry fruits take over with grapes, rum raisins and with time it gets lighter with pineapple and maybe pears.

Taste: The palate delivers all of what the nose is promising. You get dark brown sugar, caramel. dark fruits (nothing to distinct but very pleasant), rum notes again and lighter fruits take you to a very pleasant long lasting finish that develops over time. There a coffee and dark chocolate notes underlying in the nose and on the palate however, they really shine through in the finish.

Conclusion: That's a brilliantly made dram. The nose and taste are very aligned (sth. I very much appreciate!) and perfectly represent an old sherry whisky. I guess there is a lot of Oloroso  casks involved in the maturation and I highly recommend this Glengoyne expression. (92/100)"

4.0,"Nose: Honeyed sherry, dark cherries, rum, malt, orange marmalade, dried figs, manuka honey, cinnamon, chocolate, red apple, almonds. A richly layered and complex sherry nose that keeps developing through the tasting. Over time a mild peppery note appears. [The dry glass aroma is all dark honey].

Palate: A deeply malty-oak arrival with magnificent texture and poise. The development brings out dark honey flavours together with roasted nuts and dried fruit. The orange marmalade from the nose appears again accompanied by cinnamon spice and a slice of rich fruitcake. Oak is strong in the background but not too dominating, the tannin presence is just kept in check and emerges as a bittersweet dark chocolate note.

Finish: Medium/long. A malty dry sherry character becomes dominant and then segues into a very dry aftertaste that is bitter and tannic, like overbrewed strong black tea.

A polished and refined whisky with a certain reserved swagger. Allow this one the dignity of 20 minutes rest after pouring, particularly if it's a newly opened bottle. It needs time to compose itself before you presume to strike up an acquaintance.

I'm not a great fan of highly sherried whisky but when I do indulge this is the form I like it to take - reserved, complex, and a little bit of a challenge with a dry side to its personality (overly sweet in-your-face sherry bombs leave me cold). The only fault I find here is that the dryness is just one notch too loud and tends to drown the performance.

The nose is spectacular - I could enjoy nosing this all day. It's full and rich with many layers to explore. A dash of water does not hurt but changes the character slightly - it melds the nose together and reveals a slight minty note. The result is very good indeed, but harder to analyze.

The first taste is divine, but subsequent tasting uncovers the tannic note. Adding water brings out some ginger spice whilst slightly muting the tannin, which is a good trade-off for me.

The finish, whilst very good, is where I feel it falls short and exposes 21 years of cask age. If it was a smidge less bitter at the end it would be more to my palate. Again, adding water mutes the tannic dryness but here in the finish it tends to produce a flat and slightly sour aftertaste, and on the whole I prefer it neat.

I'm giving it the same rating I gave the 18. That expression is less complex but more balanced throughout, and considerably less expensive.

""Very Good"" : 4 stars."

5.0,"The nose is beautifully complex with dark fruits, cinnamon, fennel seeds and it gets more herbal when you give it some time. 
On the palate it starts with brown sugar, dark fruits I can't pinpoint. The development is very slow but a nice ping pong between the sweet, dry and fruity oloroso notes. As you would expect the finish is long, dry and very pleasant. 
In summary, this is a masterpiece of Oloroso maturation, I especially adore the plum/cinnamon flavour combo. Certainly one of my all time favourite sherry whiskies! (92/100)"

4.25,"Glengoyne 21: she is a gentle, sweet and very classy lady. The old rule applies here “A minute in the glass for each year in the cask” don’t rush this beauty if you want to get to know her.

This is a great sherry bomb with less barrel spice than I expected. Tall stills give a cleanness at the expense of perhaps a little complexity. Honestly if this was cheaper I could drink a lot of this without noticing.

3.5,"The 25 is one of if not the best valued sherry whiskies on the market. How does the 21 year at a pathetically low 43% work?

Nose - So I get oak sour and bitter notes, some sherry plums and raisins, and oddly I'm getting vanilla like I'd get from a bourbon cask which doesn't make any sense as this is all european oak sherry butts. I should add this isn't the first time I got these notes either. Very sweet, fruity, but vegtably. i get almost a sweet and sour sauce note as well. Really complex and interesting, but not exactly what I'd expect on this. This is about my 4th pour from this bottle in the last 3 days since getting it, so I've removed enough from the bottle for it to oxidize but odds are it still needs a week. As always, i will try and come back at some point if things change up. 

Taste - So up front you'll get the pathetic 43% and I'm not sure but I think this was chill filtered sadly (let me know). The result is that when it hits the tip of your tongue where often big bold whiskies blow you away without sweet flavors, it's almost a non event. Even as you get it into the middle of the tongue it's pretty boring. Then as you start to swallow, magic happens. The finish is this long complex fruity and well well aged oak note with some buttery elements, almost a burned caramel (not the caramel itself but the burned top). You get the spice from the European oak, the dark fruits from the sherry, but there's something else that's not expected that reminds me of a bourbon cask, it must be the from the malt. 

Anyway, for 150 which this can be found for, it's awesome stuff though I'd get a glendronach 18 currently for about 160 (local prices). Really good value and it brings out some of the best notes you get in a sherry whisky, but it's complex and has bitter notes unlike some of the more sweat ones. 

3.5 star score great stuff."

4.0,"This one has a lot of fame, and some people even ""dare"" to compare it to a Glendronach, and i can actually say this os a good dram, but nowhere near as good as old ""Glendro"".

Bottled at 43%abv, beautiful deep copper color. 

On the nose is way too powerful for a 43%abv; alcohol note is very present. Hazelnut, Almonds, Orange; Cherries, Sawdust, Tobacco. Strawberry syrup and Lemongrass. Cinnamon.

On the palate is nice but very straightforward. Dry. Red fruits. Sherry dim. Mostly dry fruits, and super oaky.

Aftertaste is a little harsh. Oaky, Grassy, Tobacco and Burnt wood. Ashy.

Overall this one feels too much as a cowboy whisky. A little rough around the edges. Not bad, but this distillery still has to prove they have game. 82 over 100."
