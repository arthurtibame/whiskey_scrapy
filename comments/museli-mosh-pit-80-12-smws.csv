4.0,"Super light sweet aroma, fruit with some wood.
Taste is strong and rich, makes sense for the abv. Has that distintive scotch flavor, but the sweetness and the richness remind me of preserved pears my grandmother used to make in jars. Plenty of spice on it too, especially on the tail. The strength and richness carry the spice after the sweet. Really interesting combo."
