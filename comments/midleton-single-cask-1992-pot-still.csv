4.75,"This whiskey was distilled and laid down in Midleton Distillery, Cork, in June 1992. Maturing for 20 years in cask number 31431 – it is a triple distilled, single cask, Single Pot Still whiskey which was specially selected and bottled to mark the occasion of the visit of An Taoiseach Enda Kenny T.D. to Midleton Distillery on the 25th May 2012. The visit was to celebrate the commencement of the distillery’s €100m expansion programme. 

The whiskey matured in a second fill bourbon barrel, (31431) in warehouse M10 Bay 015, it is 46% non-chilled filtered. This whiskey was not put out on general release – guess there are 250 bottles produced.

Nose: Butterscotch and diary fudge with ripening banana. Delicate grapefruit, melon sorbet and a hint of menthol, balanced with vanilla and toasted oak.
Taste: Mouth coating Pot Still with sweet flavours of vanilla, toffee, milk chocolate, cinnamon and clove. Pot Still spices with barley grains taking the final bow.
Finish: The delicate balance of flavours slowly tapers to the focus of Pot Still whiskey – the barley.
