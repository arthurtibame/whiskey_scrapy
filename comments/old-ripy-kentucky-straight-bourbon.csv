3.0,"Nose- sweet tea, orange marmalade and an astringent heat 
Body- orange, lemon, vanilla, baking spices, and a leathery earthiness that I often taste in WT products"

3.0,"Small bottle, big punch!!
Drinks an awful lot like a good rye, both spicy and fruity at the same time. Clean finish to boot."

4.0,"The label and concept got me right away. All I could smell in my glass was the glass and the initial taste felt antiseptic, grassy, and watery. But when I added a few drops of water it became sweeter and noticeable more drinkable."

4.0,"First nose is astringent, even from a 3 month open bottle.  After a minute to breath, a soft vanilla, toffee, and a slight hint of cut grass nose.  On the palate, there is a sweet and not quite creamy front, which builds to a creamy, buttery, vanilla, caramel middle, leading to a long, spicy rye finish with a thick oil feel.  Slight notes of oak and leather on the end, but not overpowering.  This is a complex little bottle."

2.0,To much like Wild Turkey
5.0,"Reading other reviews of Old Ripy makes me wonder if I’m drinking the same bourbon. On the nose, it’s a soft, gentle vanilla and toffee corn kernel. Those muted scents are surprising, because Ripy explodes on the mouth like caramel rye fireworks. I’m not typically a fan of hot, spicy ryes, but the balance exhibited here is superlative. 

In short, it’s worth the price of admission."
