1.0,"Nose: Immediate solvent/ethanol burn. The candy sweetness, like green apple, is fleeting, but reminiscent of tart apple candy.  A subtle floral notes also passes swiftly. Not very complex.

Palate: Immediate burst of candy sweetness. Like tart candy with a bit of grain background. A bit of the alcohol solvent from the nose shows up at the end of the taste as well.

Finish: Short and fiery, not in a good way. 

Conclusion: As a somebody currently working on a PhD in chemistry, I really wanted to like this solely because of the concept, but the best deception I can give is ""Sour Apple-Flavored Rubbing Alcohol"". There's just no complexity and it's hard to get past the alcohol burn that's more like an industrial solvent than a consumable alcohol. The only big flavors are a big load of tart apple and a bit of maltiness."
0.25,"I was so excited to try this.  Amazingly disappointing.  A very poor approximation of whiskey.  No mouthfeel, unpleasant nose and taste.  Not a ringing endorsement for science.  Would avoid."
0.25,Tastes so far from what it is supposed to be imitating that you would not know what it was trying to be unless you were told. Just tastes like something that needs a really overwhelming mixer to tolerate.
0.25,Sweet with a bad aftertaste.  Would rather drink almost anything else.  Dad agrees that it’s not good.  Disappointed.
2.5,"This is really interesting. It’s non aged, and not really flavored, but more like a bio-similar to aged whiskey. It’s a first batch and an entirely new process, but the flavor is not quite there yet. It tastes similar to what I would expect a $25 bottle of Canadian whiskey to taste like. I will definitely get their next release, as I expect this to get way better as they hone their craft."
3.0,"Not bad, not a true whiskey drinker yet. So, this rating is only based on not burning on way down."

1.75,"Not a terrible effort. 
On the nose there’s dried apricot fruit, and some nuttiness, but not the typical almond or hazelnut. It almost smells like old acorns. Slightly woody on the palate, with the same odd nuttiness dominating any fruit components. Ethanol is defiantly present. 
All in, this feels more like a barrel aged vodka, rather than whisky. It’s almost like someone was making whisky from memory, or playing telephone. The basic components are there, just not the best examples."

0.5,"The smell reminds me of isopropyl alcohol. I’ve never consumed isopropyl alcohol, but imagine this is what it tastes like it. 

I first tried Glyph neat, then added ice, then added splash of cola, then added a lot more cola, added some lime, then realized I wasted ice, cola, and lime."

3.0,"Tasting this for the first time I’m wowed. Not by the excellent flavor. This “3D printed” whiskey has a long ways to go before it is competitive with other traditional American whiskey brands. I’m wowed by the fact that they are not that far off on a whiskey that is the first of its kind.
Eye:Dark Straw
Nose:Almost floral,hint of cherry candy, citrus. 
Palate:Peanuts brittle,butterscotch,thin mouth feel and astringent mild finish. 
This is what I’d imagine a barrel aged vodka would taste like."
1.0,"Is this whisky? It made everyone's face turn red around me. That's normally something that is relegated to cheap grain alcohol. It tasted like smooth Jameson. It tasted like you described whisky to someone. They'll make hay by selling it as  special whisky to some goofy bars, but you could literally see which server tried it and which did not by how red their faces were. The answer is, you can make smooth 'whisky' by cheating, but it's not really whisky."
0.5,"I walk into my local wine store to buy a bottle of cheap white wine ( making wild mushroom risotto...and cheap white wine is a necessity)...and they’re serving samples of this.  From the little I know, apparently through chemistry and physics, the inventors claim to age barely few days old spirit to be equivalent as years in the normal aging process.  Amazing concept.  But that’s where it ends.  It’s an experiment that probably never should’ve been bottled for consumption.  Not neat at least.  Maybe palatable if used in a 90/10 soda/experimental whiskey drink proportion.  

The aroma should’ve clued me in.  Industrial solvents, spilled bottle of benzene ( I worked in a lab in my early 20s).  Taste like licking freshly synthesized plastic.  There’s this solvent taste that I just can’t get over.  

I saw it priced $40.  That’s about $40 too expensive."

2.0,"Nose - Corn syrup sweetness, crushed Boo-Berry cereal, crushed Oops All Berries cereal, cotton candy, light fruity oil, crushed corn cereal.

Taste - Sweet crushed corn cereal, hint of generic ""spice"" causing light tongue tingle, fake berry sweetness, Crunch Berries cereal, very thin mouthfeel, kids puffed corn cereal sweet

Finish - Light fruity bitterness, hint of ginger warmth/tingle, dark berry sweet, ligth corn syrup sweet, hint of waxy mouthfeel you get after eating kid's frosted/glazed corn cereals, cotton candy

Score - 64/100

Final Thoughts - This was quite an interesting experience. It was definitely nothing like I've ever tried before in that it really didn't fit any other whiskey profile at all. Didn't have that strong vanilla/caramel of a bourbon or rye, nor did it have that malty sweet of a single malt. This was quite thin all around, pretty much zero wood influenced flavors and just overall a bit too sweet. This tasted too much like alcoholic crushed children's puffed corn cereal. Everything tasted too artificial although I will give them credit that it didn't have that Splenda sweet, but it was more along the lines of corn syrup sweet. Nice try?

Would I drink it if offered? - No

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"
0.25,it ia not a whiskey. I think those scientists in CA studied so hard and they lost their taste buds
