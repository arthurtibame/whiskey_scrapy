3.5,"Nose: Faint notes of orange skin, honey, botanical/herbs.
Hint of salinity, caramel, hint of spice, burnt bittersweet orange skins. 
This is subtle on the nose and flavors. The spice/heat attacks in the middle and dissipates nicely. 
Overall nice whiskey, subtle and nice in approach."

3.75,"Honey, apple crisp, orange peels and a hint of smoke on the nose, the palate is full and rounded with vanilla and some sweet fruits that I can't put my finger on, the finish is longish with a little heat like you get with young whisky, but not unpleasant. Overall this seems a little delicate, well balanced and delicious."
4.25,Smooth. Not too smoky.

3.75,"This is extremely smooth!  Well balanced. Very short finish that I am finding exquisite.  Flavorful mouth filling,  yet doesn't burn going down. This makes this very DANGEROUS. SO EASY TO DRINK. 
Just WoW!"
5.0,Not your typical whiskey. Nose: citrus and caramel; taste: again citrus(orange) with some classic rye spices but more winter spices; finish: is smooth with a little oak.
