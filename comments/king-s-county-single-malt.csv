5.0,"Wow. IMHO, this is some of the best, most dynamic single malts I've had. It has depth, great mouth feel, layers of delicious flavor. After getting a 750, for $71, I had to take some time to know how much I liked this. A lot. I'm super impressed. I know this is vague, but this is easily a top pick for me."
