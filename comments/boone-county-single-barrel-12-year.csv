5.0,"Neat.  Lucky’s pick.  A really light, bright nose.  Blast of vanilla. Waffer cookie.  Hint of cherry.  Oak wraps it all together.  Alcohol subsided with 15 minutes opening it up. Hint of spearmint.  Really really good nose.

Thick mouth feel.  Darker on the tongue.  Oak and vanilla.  Oh it’s good.  It’s really good.  Creme brûlée.  Those vanilla and caramels with the oak.  Hint of cherry.  Legs linger and linger and linger.

Crap.  This is the best MGP I have had and I have had quite a few.

Ah these legs are still going and it’s still delicious."
