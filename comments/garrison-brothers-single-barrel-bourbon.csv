3.0,"This is a good whiskey, but not a great whiskey. Great color, good nose (LOTS of caramel - maybe even a caramel popcorn ball nose), nice overall flavor - wish there was more pepper on the back. Too expensive and (way) too sweet. (So sweet that more than 1 pour an evening is a little difficult.)"

4.0,"Neat; Inviting apple pie nose with notes of black pepper. Sweet mild roasted corn flavor with notes of sweetness & a touch of pepper. Light sweet corn lingering flavor that quickly switches to a light spicey flavor.
Single Barrel pick for Total Wine & More; barrel # 2352, bottle 10 out of 69. Corn harvested from farms in Dallam County in 2010. Distilled & bottled in 2011. Aged three years.
Recommended to anyone who wants a sweeter bourbon. Unfortunatly, I don't think this is worth the price of $110."

3.75,"Another Bourbon with aroma that shines and flavor that just misses really driving it home. 
Nose- excellent mix of cinnamon spice, oats, Wood & char 
Palate- a subdued return of the aroma notes but the addition of some vanilla at the end
Finish- is short and pleasant but tapers to an interesting dryness. 
I would buy this but GB products are a bit pricey."

3.0,"$109.99 @ Total Wine. Put in oak in 2011. Aged 4 yrs. Corn, Wheat and Barley mashbill.

This is one unique Bourbon. Right upfront you get candy corn, brown sugar, caramel and milk chocolate notes. On the mid pallette you get some cigar box and sweet oak and then a medium finish with more of that milk chocolate note. I have never tasted that in any other Bourbon. This Bourbon is smooth as silk all the way down.
A second sip reveals some vanilla notes as well. Quite lovely.
The big question is, is this worth a C-note? Honestly, I would have to say probably not. It's very good and I'm glad to have received it as a gift. So from that standpoint, I am very happy. If I had actually bought it, I would have rather spent it on Blood Oath Pact 3, Midwinter Nights Dram or even Barrell Batch 11 or 13."

3.0,"My initial taste hit my tongue much hotter than I had expected and thus took me a minute to get into this dram. After the initial hotness passed I picked up on vanilla, a healthy dash of pepper and some fruit (apples and a touch of orange) as the pepper wore off. This whiskey has the feel of a high quality bourbon - medium/heavy mouth feel and a long lingering aftertaste. However, the aftertaste is the part I didn't like. I heard it described by @TheNeonDram as either candy corn or plato. And yes, I can see both in the lingering aftertaste. More plato for me unfortunately. The good notes in the middle gave way far to quickly to the plato aftertaste and so even with this drink having the feel of a good bourbon, I really just wasn't wild about what I was left with. Not terrible, but not great. Especially for the price."
4.0,"Garrison Brothers Single Barrel Bourbon does two things really well: 1) it divides opinions on whether is a good bourbon or not and 2) it divides money from your wallet.

I happen to be in the camp of thinking it’s quite good. That price tag however, claims greatness and while there’s much to be loved in my opinion, great it’s not.

On the nose, a lovely vanilla resides taking up residence along side candy apples, caramel, creme brûlée, sour candy, black pepper and a freshly built wooden fence. Those are all enjoyable enough, but there’s one tough note to pinpoint and once you land on it, there’s no going back.

What I detected and attributed to candy corn, other tasters with me identified as “Play-Doh.” Once that happened, the dram become less of a pleasant experience for them and more of a chore to get through. 

This one is smooth on the tongue with a medium mouth feel. A nice residual heat is unearthed a moment after swallowing, reminding you that it’s humble, but still 94 proof. 

The finish is super dry offering dark woody notes and dried nuts.

This Single Barrel Bourbon has the potential to be a really fun experience. Hopefully, you land on candy corn.

3.0,"Lets just get straight to the point with this bourbon hailing from Texas - Butterscotch and caramel finished with sweet green apples and a hint pepper.  I have only visited Texas once and I do plan on visiting the Lone Star State again at some point with intentions of visiting a few distilleries.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same for Garrison Brothers Single Barrel. Not for the price."

3.25,"This dram appears to be an opinion divider. I read the reviews and saw apple pie on the nose,  yeah weirdly it does, tastes like egg nog, again check. A lot of interesting flavour profiles coming through. You get cherry and apricot liquor and caramelized peaches on the nose. Palate is oakey cough syrup but not in an initially terrible way (although as you work through it it gets a bit too much). I'm torn on this one. A bit like four roses single barrel bourbon for me. Great delivery and quality, no flaws but I couldn't drink too much of this at all and in fact as I work my way through the dram and keep writing the review I think one drams more than enough. Hmm quality 4, flavour profile 2.5. 3.25 I think."

4.75,"I was introduced to Garrison Brothers by a friend and I must say I sincerely enjoy this product. It is delightful from start to finish. The initial smell of the bottle I recently purchased hits strongly of nutmeg in egg nog. The taste follows suit and has a sweet start like vanilla, a spicy middle, and warm finish. I would recommend this to anyone. The fact that it is from Texas just makes it that much more special. Cost only accounts for .25 points off of a 5.0 rating."

4.5,Perfect balance of sweetness and spice. Vanilla and oaky on the nose. Light fruit notes and a subtle butterscotch on the palate.
4.5,"I may be biased as I picked this Barrell myself. I think this is great, tried 7 barrels, went with this one barreled on Oct 30, 2016. Bottled on November 11, 2019. 

For only a 3 year old whiskey amazing wood and flavor! Obviously the Texas heat plays a major part. If you can find a honey barrel it’s worth it. This is extremely close to Cowboys taste profile

123.4 proof"
4.0,"Second taste notes: sawdust and leather on the nose, white corn (reminiscent of hominy) and oak on the palate. Very nice, as is the small batch, but for $20 more? No. It’s too similar and it’s the exact same proof."

4.0,"Thank you to the kind Total Wine employee who let me try this in store. It was good. A very well balanced whiskey with sweet vanilla, spice, oak, and earthiness I really enjoyed. Ive heard Garrison Bro’s whiskeys have been hit or miss for some people, but this one was a hit in my book. I would’ve purchased a bottle that day, BUT Garrison Bro’s are waaaaay overpriced. Don’t get me wrong it’s a great whiskey, and one I’d love to explore further. It just not worth the $110 price tag, especially for 94 proof. I’d pay $70 at most AND if it was cask strength. Lose some points for price"
