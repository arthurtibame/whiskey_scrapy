On the palate this is complex.  Chocolate, coffee, dark fruits and much more.  The finish is medium length with chocolate and tobacco.   A superb drink."

4.0,"Stumbled upon this while waiting for my key at The Mallard Lounge at the Fairmont Chateau in Whistler. Only a handful of cases in all of BC. Can't recall a scotch ever presenting so chocolatey on the nose. With a sip, the familiar Glenmorangie is there in the background, but likely owing to the 30 year base the flavour is so much more balanced. For such a unique ""roasting"" of the malt there's nary a toasted or burnt taste. Worth the experience, but likely wouldn't go out of my way for a bottle."

Had a real good brisket sambo, chips and a potato salad. This Glenmo was very easy down with heaps of dried fruit flavour and chocolatey stuff smoothing it all out.

The palate has the chocolate with some major fruit currants. Black cherries as big as mountains. This all sounds superb, but after some oxidation, I started getting an off-putting banana note. If you like bananas (not for me) then you'll grant it 5 stars, hands down. It does have a nice medium length spicy finish."

4.0,"Delicious, and quite different. This isn't your typical scotch, and there's enough complexity to keep your nose and palate guessing for quite some time. The nose has aromas of orange marmalade, toasted barley and tea - adding a few drops of water really brings out fruitier notes like raisins and figs. The palate is positively puzzling, with roasted coffee beans and malt, enhanced with a panoply of spices. As for the finish, it's long and dry, ending the taste on a high note. Cheers!"

4.0,"I had my eye on this one with a view to maybe picking up a bottle from Duty Free on the way home from the USA ($90 USD vs $200 USD from NZ retailers) so I thought I'd crack open a sample to see if it's worth it whilst watching the Lions play the All Blacks. Beautiful colour, typical sweet Glenmorangie nose with the scent of cocoa a hint of what's to come. Taste is good, definitely getting the cocoa / chocolate malt coming through which is quite unusual, slightly bitter or burnt. Dry, woodiness forms the base and translates to the medium/short finish. Do I like it? Yes. Definitely not the amazing drop it's been trumpeted, lacking the touted rich, thick syrupy chocolate I was expecting. Perhaps after many years on the market they are running of the better / older casks? Would buy a bottle at $90USD to see how it develops over time. Wouldn't pay much more though. Solid 4.

Update 2020 Dramfest. Another crack and meh still didn't rise higher, in fact I'd say more 3.75"

Finish - Lingering dark chocolate bitterness, sweet nutty bittersweet, faint black pepper fading heat, malted milk candy sweet.
Score - 89/100
Final Thoughts - This is my favorite Glenmorangie expression I've tried thus far. The nose is incredible and I can feel as if I can nose it for days. Sadly it falls a bit flat once it hits the tongue as you're a bit overwhelmed by the soft chocolate bittersweet. I was hoping to get a bit more dark stone fruits, but those were significantly downplayed and overwhelmed by the chocolate bittersweet. The finish is long lasting, but is a bit one-dimensional as it lingers like you ate a dark chocolate malted milk ball and that's about it. Definitely meant to be sipped neat, although I can see this being turned into a super fancy chocolate/dessert old fashioned too."

null,"** Disclaimer: This review is what I would consider a “Quick Hit”- meaning I won’t have my usual in-depth notes that I usually like to take. The reason: this sample was poured at Whiskyfest DC on 4/17/18. All of these reviews will not be scored and I am actively looking to try them again at some point to do them more justice.

This was a dram that @Generously_Paul and I talked a good bit about once we saw that it was going to be poured at the festival.  I’ve heard and read great things, but I don’t think there’s a widely available bottle from GM that’s worth more than $100.  So, I’ve passed on buying a Signet numerous times.

I seem to recall the nose being somewhat absent (keep in mind we were kind of rolling through the VIP hour so we didn’t let anything really sit for long) and upon my first sip I didn’t get any of the coffee notes everyone claims are present.  As I finished the generous sized pour (A+ rating for the pour sizes at the GM & Ardbeg tables) I really picked up a nice profile on the Signet.  Coffee and espresso notes lead to a fulfilling mouthfeel and lengthy finish.  It was a really smooth dram all around.  I’m not sure I’d pony up $200+ for a full bottle, but I definitely liked it.  It’s close to 4.5 stars on flavor profile, though.  Cheers."

No scores for anything sampled as I don’t think it would be fair.

A very different Glenmorangie, but good. Grapes, fruity and vanilla on the nose. Something else I couldn’t figure out but whatever it was I liked it. 

Oak and coffee on the palate. Very good indeed.

5.0,"Signet is perhaps the most loved unpeated single malt on Distiller, so I brought a bottle back from England to test the hypothesis that I just don’t enjoy Scotch that much. I know, heresy, right? The nose of Terry’s chocolate orange, combined with the rich burnished bronze colour and the stunning bottle design definitely set you up for a delight. The taste is sweet, rich, long-lasting, with delicious coffee notes throughout. In fact, it tastes as good as coffee smells before it’s brewed. The malty taste I dislike in most Scotches is transmuted, here, into a kind of liquid tiramisu. So, reluctantly, I have to admit: you were right. It is divine."

This has really old barrels in it along with their roasted or “chocolate” malt. It really does have a rich dark coffee/chocolate flavor. With all that and the beautiful packaging this is a great bottle to enjoy during the holidays.....or anytime really.

However every sip after kept just getting better and better. I had only poured a small amount because I am savoring this bottle but every sip left me wanting more and more of it. I feel like I could have drank the whole bottle in one sitting. Bronze in color and traditionally sweet like most Glenmorangies but one of the smoothest I have ever tasted. I thought the notes of chocolate were quite subtle and I didn’t get the coffee I was hoping for but absolutely delicious none the less. I got more of the dark fruits and spice than anything. Just when I thought it was over, the finish came rushing back and it was like drinking this all over again and I never wanted it to leave.

After reading all the great reviews about this treasured #scotch and overcoming the hefty price tag ($163 for 750mL bottle), I opened this beautifully bottled whisky for my first taste - ever. Before I start the review, here are some vital facts and stats. The #Signet is comprised of two unique types of malted barley: Cadboll malted barley and malted “chocolate” barley (often used to create craft beers). After being distilled twice, this whisky is matured in virgin American oak casks (as well as ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks) and said to contain batches that are 35 to 40 years old. It's #nonchillfiltered and #nocoloradded at 46% ABV. Reviewed on 8/31/2018.
....…......….…...........................................................................
Nose: 95. Rich @Godiva milk chocolate. English toffee. Vanilla custard. Baked cinnamon buns. Tiramisu. Banana creme pie. I can literally sniff this dram for an hour without drinking it.
....…......….…...........................................................................
Palate: 94. Spicy ginger and zesty orange peel evolve into a creamy mocha and vanilla custard. Smooth and velvety texture that coats your mouth with sweet, spice, and zest all around.
....…......….…...........................................................................
Finish: 95. Long spicy finish with dates and dark chocolate that linger.
....…......….…...........................................................................
Overall Experience: 95. It’s a wonderful experience both with and without water. Although it's a #nonagestatement, you can taste the quality and age of this #whisky. Kudos to #Glenmorangie for this unique and outstanding creation.
....…......….…...........................................................................
Value for Money: Although this bottle sells for about $200 USD, the quality is not lacking in any way. Even the packaging is over-the-top with the cork that can be used as a paperweight. You will save this botle (and box) when it's empty. I got this bottle for only $163 @allendalewine"

5.0,"This week, this is my favorite non-peated scotch.  It replaces my dearly departed 1976 vintage Macallan 18.  More recent Mac 18s seem to have backslid, and Glenmorangie has stepped up to fill that hole in my palette with this.

Except that it's completely different from your run of the mill sherried Speyside.

I don't much care for overly sweet scotch.  Years ago, Jim Murray rated the Glenmorangie Ealanta as whiskey of the year.  I couldn't tell if it tasted more like Bourbon or Brandy, either being way outside my tolerance for sweet.

But Signet is way sweet in an entirely different and less offensive (for me) way.  It is more of a dark, fruity sweetness, but I really can't place the fruit.  It is deeply rich, mildly spicy, truly complex, and front and center.

It almost begs to be chewed on and very much reminds me of drinking a stout, only better.

to be fair, this is my first experience with a so-called chocolate malt, so maybe it's just the genre that's struck such a positive note with me.

Either way, it's like taking my tastebuds and olfactory glands to the spa.  It makes me feel warm and coddled"
4.5,"This is an NAS I can really get behind. Much better and more complex than the 18, with beautiful caramel and chocolate notes and classic elegance. 95"

Nose: dry raisin, sherry, caramel notes, light oak, hints of chocolate, floral (heather), melon fruits. Really sugary and Sweet nose. 

Body: smooth, enveloping, so easy medium body

Palate: bourbon-y sweetness, creamy, medium spice, oak, apricot, malt

Finish: long, warming with milk chocolate, vanilla, toffee, espresso

Note: whoa, delicious, so smooth and easy drinking, creamy chocolate notes but a little spice is nice. A beautiful hybrid bourbon and sherry. So we’ll put together and super good"

Nose - vanilla and believe it or not I get white chocolate.  Burnt caramel.  A touch of honey.  

Taste - Dark honey, light chocolate notes, toast.

Finish - sweet linger light oak.  

This is a nice pour and it's a shame this is pushing into the 200+ range.  At that point, I'd likely pass.  All and all if you want a dessert scotch this is a nice option but you really have to like sweet flavors."

3.75,Nice deep dark scotch. Starts off with malt and chocolate and moves towards dark roast coffee beans with a touch of spice reminiscent of a rye. It has a smooth translation into a nice long warm malty finish.  It’s a good scotch but IMHO it’s not worth the money. Better scotch can be had for a lot less money.

Palate: Creamy, more cocoa, dried fruits
Finish: More dried fruits, some spice"
5.0,"First off let me set the setting for you as I was drinking this awesome dram. I was cooking a fine slab of meat for the girlfriend and I and decided while the steak was baking in the oven I would enjoy a pour of this juice.

On the nose even through the smell of steak was heavy dark chocolate and coffee notes with wood spikes coming through on the first time around. The second smells and I could get was soft baking spices and fruity with a slight chocolate finish which was odd considering the first smells were all chocolate.

The first sip coats your tongue and covers your mouth with a syrupy mouthfeel and not a bad one at that. The fact that there is little to no burn even on a first sip is dangerous and just makes you want the next sip that much faster. The first notes I got were of the wood which was surprising but immediately after the rich coffee notes came running and carried me through with notes of honey, chocolate, dark rich fruits and barley. The fact that this juice was rich and carried a heavy mouthfeel was amazing and served as a great appetizer for my dinner. 
The finish was not as long as I was hoping but it was longer than others and certainly more enjoyable as it left my mouth coated but not with a lot of the notes you get while sipping but more of as a reminder that your mouth just had something very rich and it is craving for more. 

I would highly recommend this scotch for any coffee drinkers and anyone that wants rich complex whiskey. I can say nothing bad about this whiskey except that it is quickly being consumed at an alarming rate and I hope to find another bottle at retail price to have as a replacement."

5.0,"Glenmorangie began as a brewery before being converted to a distillery in 1843. Since then, as with most distilleries in Scotland, it has changed owners multiple times before being aquired by Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy in 2004.
Glenmorangie is known to have the tallest necks on their stills in all of Scotland, at 16 feet 10 inches. This would be the reason why you'll see giraffes in some of the visuals featuring Glenmorangie name.
They use unpeated malted barley but once a year some chocolate malt is added to the mash specifically for their Signet expression.
The signet design is featured across the entire Glenmorangie range but only one bears the name. The design comes from Hilton of Cadboll Stone carving done in late 8th century AD by the Picts, tribal people of northern Scotland at the time, and is an important historical artifact.
While there is no age statement on the bottle, there's chatter that it contains whisky as old as 30 to 40 years.
On the nose there citrus and flowers followed by dark chocolate, lemon and butter cookies. The palate starts with black pepper spice and cigar tobacco then gets sweet with dark chocolate a bit of honey. On the finish, citrus flavors return with orange zest, lemon icing, a bit of brown sugar sweetness and biscuit.
Extremely well done with all the flavors layered instead of smashed together, following one another in a way that is complimentary and pleasant. The more a person sits on a full pour, the more different flavors they will pick out. My quick flavor notes do not do it justice."

4.5,"This bottle, buried in my wishlist, caught my eye from the top shelf at a French restaurant’s bar. It wasn’t on the menu, but I decided to pay the $15 negotiated with the bar tender for a half-pour. Tasted following duck confit crêpe and crème brûlée. Nose: sea salt caramel, dark chocolate, toasted coconut, coffee being roasted. Palate: toasty, malt driven, yet still well rounded, layered. Mouthfeel: waxy, tingling. Finish: warming, light-roast cortado. Empty glass: dark chocolate, mellow tobacco. Overall: As unique as it is exquisite, Signet is a barley beauty, with layer upon layer of maltiness showing off from start to finish."

4.25,"Typical Glenmorangie orange on the nose, but uniquely coffee and chocolate notes are also present. Silky smooth on the tongue, with spice and orange present. There is for sure espresso notes, but I don't find it as strong as other tasters. The finish is easy like Sunday morning, but there is some lingering spice like you may have had one dram too many the night before. A unique experience to say the least."
4.0,Smooth.  A lot of chocolate taste... I don’t care much for chocolate which is why this is only a 4
4.75,"Sorry not sorry. Another Glenmorangie at 4.75. This guy is every bit as smooth as the Lasanta, but with much deeper complexity. Milk chocolate and nuttiness on the nose. On the palate, we have rich coffee character mingled with the classic highland earthiness. There’s fruit in there too, more like bright Rainier cherry than anything. Incredible long finish on this dram."

5.0,"OH MY GOD. 
Oh my god. 
Oh my god.

This is, after 175 whiskies, the best dram i have ever had. It was only a 3cl sample but there is no comparison to this. It is fairly expensive (around $150) but it is worthy for its content and remarkably beautifull bottle. 

This perfect dram comes at 46%abv, with a perfect russetmuscat color.

On the nose is so freaking great, very sweet. As soon as i opened the sample i got an earthy aroma, and i ask to myself: peat? On a glenmorangie? This shall be interesting. Well, in the glencairn it became absolutely outstanding: sherry, toasted caramel, jellybeans (the most powerful note), some dim peat reek, old orange peel, sugar and cotton. Complex, sweet, dim peatiness, just amazing.

On the palate, the aroma promise became true. First sip: spicy pleasant elegant bomb. Ashy aftertaste. The rest of the dram threw me a lot more: milk chocolate, bitter chocolate, toasted sugar, hay, sugar, ashes, smoke, cinnamon in a superb way. Finish is so long i still taste chocolate after half an hour. Sublime. Full mouth spice and chocolate aftertaste. Truly a perfect work of craftmanship. 

I give this dram a perfect score, 100 out 100, it might just be 1000 over 100. Never drink anything else. Absolutely recomended. Even now i still smell cremè brulee from the glass that is 50cm far from me. 

I have now a new ruler in the whisky kingdom, long live Glenmorangie Signet."

The 18 was great but this has zero alcohol on the nose and it’s at 46% which is crazy for that. It’s a dessert dram and very complex. Finish is very sweet and smooth. Easily one of my all time favorites. The price is extremely cheap for what you get. 100/100

Non aged stated whisky especially at that price point can be a concern but trying it once at a party and seeing it one sale at an airport, I knew it was meant to be as i had nothing but gold memories though vague they may be.

Down the hatch: The balance is remarkable and immediately you get chocolate, nuts, a touch of tobacco.
