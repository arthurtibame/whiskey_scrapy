4.5,"The nose is very maritime, like a sea spray and maybe some seaweed, mixed with quite bright citrus and some vanilla. I might have been hallucinating but I could swear I smelled some dark roasted coffee beans as well. The peat is there but quite muted.

The taste initially punches you in the mouth with the high ABV then turns briny and sort of citrus and lemon zest in character with the freshly charred oak hogsheads showing up and gradually fades into the peat that is rounding it of.

The aftertaste is long and pleasant.

Opened up a lot with about a teaspoon of water to 4 cl pour, much more fruit and sweetness shows up on the taste and the nose becomes more lemon and citrus.

This is potent whisky presented at cask strength, matured in freshly charred American oak hogsheads. It is a Talisker for sure but not at all what I am familiar with in the regular 10 year old!"

4.5,"And now for something completely different: a fruity Talisker. Peaches, blood orange and grapefruit squeeze their way into the profile of this satisfyingly oily dram, dramatically so when diluted to 50%. The peaches interplay with the classic Talisker sea spray on the nose and burst out of their tin on the palate, where the fruit mingles with a powerful peat. The finish sparkles with pricks of pepper, juicy fruit and a splash of cream. Deliciously different from a typical Talisker, the fruit notes remind me of the Balblair recently bottled by Compass Box for their Myth & Legends series. A worthy special release."
4.5,"The only other talisker I've had is the 10 year, and this is quite different.  Doesn't have as much of an intense brine or peat flavor to it, but it's still an extraordinary malt.  Lots of your typical vanilla sweetness from the ex bourbon casks, then brine and peat.

Overall, very good expression, A-"

Stays for a time in the tongue."
