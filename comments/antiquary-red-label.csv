3.5,"For a cheap blended scotch, actually the cheapest of Antiquary expressions, it is not bad at all. Very standard whisky that works well on they want, that is to reach lots of people who like whisky and they are not intending to really write a review about it. 

Bottled at 40%abv, very light pale straw color which makes me think no colouring was involved. I respect that in a blend. 

On the nose, it is pretty decent. Cake, 
Cereal, custard cream, Pears, Dim chocolate, Dim orange peel. After first sip: grain whisky appears, easy detectable. 

On the palate it is ok. Vanilla, Pepper, Apples and Honey. Very standard.

Aftertaste is not that good. Grain whisky, Maize and Cereal.

Overall this is a 72/100 whisky and i think it is fair. For the price is not bad, and could be used for mixers."
