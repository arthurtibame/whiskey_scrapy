3.75,"Nose: Vanilla. Apple and subtle pear notes. Oaky. Bit of an ethanol smell to be honest.

Palate: Vanilla blended with fruitiness. Smooth and simple. Not harsh and slightly sweet.

Finish: Medium. Vanilla stays strongest throughout but hints of pear and oak. Very smooth.

Overall Thoughts: Not a bad whiskey. I’d never heard of it before I found it at my local liquor store. It’s pleasant and easy to drink. Not much negative to say about it aside from the somewhat potent ethanol smell on the nose."
