3.0,"The nose is sweet, but has the traditional rye notes. 
On the palate it’s a touch sweet for 121 proof, has some spice, but finishes with loads of mint. So much so that I feel like I just brushed my teeth."

3.5,"Had this double blind and was pleasantly surprised. Definitely didn't pin it as MGP's 95/5 mashbill as there was zero dill so I wonder if it's their 51% rye? Either way, it was pretty good. I'd buy a bottle at ~$60, but not the $100+ folks are trying to get for it now."
