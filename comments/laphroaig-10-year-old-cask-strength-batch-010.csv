4.75,"On the nose, smoke hits you for sure, but it’s more rounded than the standard 10. The wood notes from the bourbon casks are more apparent as well. Some smooth pear notes are hiding in the very back but are there. On the palate the wood notes and smoke persist, followed by a dusty malt flavor. The Cask Strength means there are some subtle nuances that aren’t there in the 10 and this is clear especially with the wood, malt, and fruity aspects."

4.25,"Laphroaig 10 but the flavor is on steroids. Unlike 10, there are grassy notes that remind me of Lagavulin 16. In my opinion, a definite improvement on an already great whisky!"

4.0,"This one has the salty, smoky, brininess I enjoy in Laphroaig, but with that strong alcohol heat at the backside."

4.0,"On the nose: citrus, rubber, and smoke.

On the palette: spikes of sweetness and smokiness… turned up a bit higher than what you would find in the standard Laphroaig 10. 

Honestly, I do find it tasting very similar to Laphroaig 10 but with more heat."

3.0,Bottle recommends adding 2:1 water to whiskey and basically tastes like regular Laphroig 10🤷🏻‍♂️

4.5,"Peaty yet sweet, with a bit of oak at the end that comes out more if you add a bit of water. This is one of the best, would love to taste a slightly older cask strength and I wish more scotches started releasing higher proof expressions."

4.5,Very distinctive oak and smokey flavors that lingers on your palate for quite a while leaving a great smokey aftertaste. Its evident the whiskey has absorbed the flavor of the wood. Great cask strength scotch!
4.0,Noise is very woody light peaty. First taste is full of oak carmel and sea salt. Quick punch at first taste and smooth finish.
4.5,"It's our 10th wedding anniversary today and so after coming back from dinner I thought what better way to cap it off by cracking open a 10 year cask strength Batch 10 Laphroaig. Good things come in triple 10s!

Straight away it was good out of the glass, I was afraid to detract by adding water, but I threw in a few drops anyhow. Damn a great drop, what the 10 year should be by default...nearly 20% higher abv. It's been a while since I had the 10 but from memory pretty similar.  Would love to work through a bottle but limited release not over here. Iodine, beautiful sweet vanilla,  seasalt, smoked bog and more. 4.25 easy peasy at least..then by the end 4.5..so damn rich."
4.75,"Fucking awesome pour. Like Laphroaig 10 jacked up to 11. Peat, smoke, brine, salt, Iodine and slight bacon times a million. Crazy long finish that lasts all night. One of my favorites."
