4.25,"This was one of two “Dream Drams” I sampled today at the Whisky Show in London - my first Brora. It has a delicate, slightly waxy nose, light tea flavors (Earl Grey etc) in the mouth, and a salty, savoury finish of significant length. It’s always hard to fully appreciate a whisky at these events - and near impossible to distinguish between a four star and a five star - but this is clearly a classy whisky with a unique flavor profile that deserves more contemplation than I could give it. A treat."
