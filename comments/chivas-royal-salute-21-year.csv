5.0,"This is a re review first time I gave it 3/5 but I have since changed my mind. First of all they lowered the price. So if you can get this for $100 per bottle than its 5/5. 

The nose is really really rich, think of baked apples and pears. The palate is fruity forward with the taste of bitter oak. Then the finish transitions into a dry taste with a lingering whisp of smoke. I just had a ballantines 17 and I gotta say I prefer the royal salute. It's really rich for a blend and very tasty. At the $100 mark are there better single malts? Yes of course but for a blend is definitely one of the best I've had. Cheers"

3.0,"Strathisla continues to assert itself even after 21 years in oak and being in competition with 20-30 other malts. This one is good, if a bit thin, having notes of sweet malt (initially), sherry, buttermilk scone, apple, plum, and a touch of nutmeg. A perfectly competent whisky for which I probably wouldn't pay what Pernod is asking."

3.75,"A rich whisky from Chivas is aged for 21 years in oak casks before bottling in handcrafted porcelain flagons. Royal Salute was launched on 2nd June 1953 as a tribute to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on her Coronation Day. The name of this Scotch Whisky comes from the 21 Gun Royal Salute, which is fired as a mark of respect for powerful dignitaries. At her coronation, the crown of Queen Elizabeth II was set in rubies, sapphires and emeralds. These precious stones remain the basis for the colours of Royal Salute's handcrafted flagons.

Nose - Fresh, with orange, soft spices, gingerbread and cereals. 
Taste - Smooth approach, then burnt caramel. Wood influence comes next, with a much drier profile leading to hints of smokiness. 

This is a present from great pal Dave Quinn (Rest in Peace Dave). Whiskey is as colourful and fun as Dave always was, drinking it slowly as cannot be replaced

(credit to published reviews - on which I built mine)"

3.75,"Ok, you will pay for the brand, story telling and bottle. But that doesn't make it a bad blended whisky. Give your nose some time to develop a taste for it and search for the details before your just sink it in. It a high quality design blend, but of course doesn't have the clean spirit of a single malt."

4.0,"Found an unopened bottle from somewhere in the 1980s in my Dad’s stash. Less common brown flagon. Cork crumbled on opening, had to pry it out and then filter out the pieces with cheesecloth. 

Definitely a different kind of drink. I’m a bourbon guy, so this was quite sweet. Honey, molasses, fruit (raisins?), followed by wood. No real burn at all. This might be too cloyingly sweet for me, but I’ll be sure to keep coming back and trying it over time."

3.5,"Amazing deep dark nose with butterscotch and vanilla, taste matches the smell with a little tiny dash of smoke up front.  My only complaint is the finish is very short and thin.  This whiskey desperately needs to be at 46% abv."

2.5,"Strong malt on the nose, with a burst of fruit. Stings the nose as well. On the palate, not as sweet as you would expect initially, the sweetness creeps up. A bit of smoke and spice at the end. Dry finish. 1/1/20"
5.0,"Smooth, mellow"
4.0,"The nose is complex. You get all the sugary notes and a tiny hint of sherry in the background plus some generous smoky note and a little hint of peat, sea breeze hidden in the background. On the palate the smoky notes took over more but very balance throughout."

5.0,"Best whisky ever. Even better, way better than the Johnnie Walker XR. On the nose you'll get a lot of vanilla, with a little smoke, cotton, a little chocolate or coffee perhaps. Very sweet on the nose. On the palate starts sweet with a complex flavor where you can taste some caramel and maybe apple, to quickly transform into a very spicy but complex flavor. Never before i have had a whisky that can be spicy and sweet at the same moment, not one after another, but in the same moment. The finish is long and satisfying, with a fresh ending with the spicyness still present in the back. Beautiful whisky, so far my number 1 ever. i have never given a 100% on a scotch before. this Whisky deserves it."
