4.75,Not sure on the edition but this particular pour was exceptional.
4.5,"Smooth, oaky, caramels with just the right punch. Ice or no ice, no mixer required. Goes great with a perfect cigar!🥃‼️"
3.75,Darker color than.1856; you can see it's been aged longer. Lingering smokey but sweet  tone with some TN heat on the end. Good sipper.
