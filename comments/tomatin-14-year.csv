Dry finish with a bit of mango that lasts a while. Enjoyable, but unremarkable. A good deal better than their 12 y.o. [1st try: 87] [2nd try: 86]"

4.0,"Jam Bars. Linzertorte. Jammie Dodgers. You know the concept - buttery pastry plus fruity, sweet jam. That's this whisky in a nutshell. Port pipe finishing always seems to lend a jammy, berry-inflected profile, and that's the case here - luscious raspberry jam, with some vanilla and pie crust. The palate is hotter than I would expect from a 14 year old, but delivers the promises made on the nose...plush and fruity, almost decadently so, with a pleasantly mild vanilla note, pastry crust, and a reasonably long finish. I wouldn't call this a complex dram (its flavors are clear and straightforward), but that's no crime...especially when simplicity equals simply delicious!"
3.0,3.5.  Nose is sweet and fruity.  Relatively smooth and fruity with a hot spicy finish.

4.0,"It's time I reviewed another scotch from a dark horse favorite of mine:  Tomatin.  These guys have quickly climbed the ranks of my all-time favorite whiskies.  The fact they offer more great vintages and experimental finishes while keeping their median prices in the $45-60 range is icing on the proverbial spice cake.  So, let's get into the 14 year old version that was finished in tawny port wine casks.  It comes in at a slightly elevated 92 proof and the 750ml bottle cost me a cool $55 online.

The aroma is filled to the brim with red berry sweetness:  juicy red raspberries and dark cherry with just a hint of plum.  There's a faint bit of toffee and butterscotch but no oak presence at all.  This was finished in port barrels for just over a year so there's also a nice red wine tint that deepens and enriches the normal straw yellow whisky.  It looks really inviting and smells very sweet.

On the tongue there's a remarkable amount of dark fruit.  It reminds me of a really potent fruit punch from my childhood.  Some might think it's too fruity, but I'm really digging it.  There's a gigantic blast of heat towards the end from the alcohol to remind you it's whisky and not Hi-C fruit punch you're drinking and that's actually quite welcome.  It's a bit harsh for being 14 years old (I'm basing that off the fact I thought the 12 year was reasonably smooth).  Still, this is clearly a dessert dram for sure.

The finish is hotter than I expected, but damn if the fruit just lingers and lingers.  It's quite enjoyable.  It's medium in length and maintains its warmth longer than I expected.  This is another winning Tomatin IMO.  

It would probably work better in the springtime as a nice homage to the changing of seasons from cold to warm, so I may let this bottle hang around through the holidays and return to it on those unseasonably warm Feb & March evenings.  

If you see this one sitting on shelves near you don't hesitate to give it a try.  At less than $60 you won't be disappointed.  It's better than a lot of higher priced Highland single malts that cost $10-20 more a bottle.  More like 4.25 stars.  Cheers."

4.0,"A fine balance between bourbon and port casks. The port is assertive, but not too much. Berries and honey on the nose. Nice spice throughout and into the finish. It takes water well without losing the spice. Short bread makes an enjoyable appearance in the finish. Pairs well with chocolate. A value at $60."

4.0,"Review transfer from Barreled from December 2016


This 14 year old Tomatin is 46% ABV, is non chill filtered and is natural color. The color is a beautiful amber peach. This Highland scotch is matured in ex bourbon barrels and finished in port pipes that previously held port wines for around 50 years. 

There is a burst of oaky raisins initially on the nose. After a few minutes the raisins disappear and an abundance of red berries and sweet red wines take over. It develops into baked apples, apricots, and oranges. The bourbon barrels also come through with vanilla, butterscotch, toffee, and caramel. Truly a wonderfully sweet nose. 

The palate takes off in another direction entirely. A wave of spice washes over the tongue and coats the mouth. Immediately following the spice is a candy sweetness with dark berries and plums. Plenty of oak and some bitter nuttiness like raw walnuts. Very full bodied. 

The mouthfeel is very drying and mouth coating. The finish is good and long. Spicy with some bitter dark chocolate. 

Tomatin has quickly climbed the ranks among my Highland scotch favorites. This port finished scotch is much stronger than I expected and I wouldn't consider it a desert dram like I do with the Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban, but it's damn good.  I would love to get my hands on the 1988 Tomatin that is 25 years old and probably uses higher quality port wood, but at over $400 I doubt I'll seek it out. However for around $55 I would buy this one in a heartbeat. Thanks to @LeeEvolved for the sample. 4.5
Cheers"

4.0,"Day 13. Had to skip a day because of a root canal, and writing tasting notes when all you taste is dentist is really no fun. And this dram deserved better. That's why today is gonna be a double hit. First this, and Jura later. 

Nose is very fruity and sweet, with honey, caramel, prunes, cherries, raisins and some spicy cinnamon. 

Taste has a bit of spice to it, and some burn. Good. It needed that. There is chocolate, honey, sweet plums, a hint of coffee and some cloves in this. Very enjoyable this. Sweet but not too sweet thanks to the spicy burn. I like this one. 

The aftertaste is straight up chocolate plums. Love em.

All in all a very decent whisky for the pricepoint. Might need to get a bottle of that."

3.5,This is a hard one. Definitely good port casking there but unfortunately it really isn't balanced with the  alcohol which overpowers the cask with it's strength and slight harshness. It's only 46% but comes across several % higher at least and definitely cleared out and sanitised my nasal passages when I took a wiff. Towards the end I started getting into it more so maybe if i worked my way through a bottle it might gell a bit more. Definitely a 3.5 as its only $60USD but unfortunately I had the 1977 portwood shortly after and in comparing to that it was hard to round up to a 4.

4.25,"Ok, I’m done with putting up with Barreled’s quirkiness. I like the simplistic format but from now on I will be posting reviews here as well as porting over earlier reviews. Here’s the latest. 

I bought this bottle for Burns night along with the Bowmore 15. My only previous experience with this distillery was the Cu Bocan, which I liked very much. Having heard good things about the rest of their products I was eager to try something else.

This dram is aged for 14 years in a combination of ex-bourbon and port casks. It's bottled at a nice 46% ABV and is a medium gold in the glass. Swirling produces slow forming legs with some clingy water droplets. Not sure about colorant or chill filtration; nothing stated on the bottle or website.

The nose is classic scotch: strong barley, berries and orchard fruits, malty biscuit, and soft honey. Nothing special, but very nice. The palate is sweet honey, fruits, hints of milk chocolate, nuts. The mouthwatering taste gives way to just a hint of smoke on the back end. 

The finish is decently long. There's a warm, slightly smoky malt and cereal with burnt sugar. It hangs around quite a while if you can resist taking another sip. I got this from Acespirits.com with their Burns night discount of 10% for $50. Even at the full price of $55 this is a very good value. Very worth your while to pick up if you get a chance. 4.25/5. Cheers!"

3.25,"Nose: fruity and sweet aromas. The 46 ABV is not knocking off the nose. Smells like Vino santo (though way less sugar) and Christmas flavours.

First sip is strong and it is the contrary of the smells that were really light. Now we feel the 46ABV. Liquor, dried fruits and dry feeling on the end of the tongue.

Later tastes with water. The smell gets a bit more salty. However it is still very strong and dries the back of the tongue. Nuts and golden syrup tastes come to finish.

Complete and strong whisky for beginners"

4.0,"I got to try this at a scotch tasting next to the 12 year Tomatin, and it is a marked improvement. The time spent in the port casks really helps bring some complexity to this whisky. 

The nose is light with sweet fruit, lemon, berries, and honey. The sweet fruit flavor continues on the palate, but develops more grape notes with some brown sugar. The palate is very similar to the 12 year but with more complexity. The finish is spicier than you'd expect, with a ginger flavor.

If you enjoy Tomatin 12 and Dualchas, you will enjoy the 14 year as well. However, for near the same price you can usually find the Tomatin cask strength which has even stronger complex flavors, and I think is a much better value."

On the palate, I get Ovaltine and dried fruit, vanilla pudding with some grappa spikes and dusty walnuts. 

The finish is medium/long. 

I have enjoyed this bottle but liked the first half better than the second. It didn’t evolve but he way I thought it might. Still a strong one and good value."

3.5,"A good friend of mine was gifted three bottles of whisky for his birthday. A Japanese one, a Bulleit Bourbon, and a Tomation Single Malt. As he wanted to share a few drams, we decided to keep a small tasting.

This 14-year-old Port Finished Tomatin was our third dram, and as I expected, the better one of the lineup.

The nose was sweet, slightly nutty, but fruitful, but evolved to a sweeter, spicier palate. The port influence was noticeable, but not too prominent. The aftertaste was moderate, but where it loses a bit in wine, it gained a bit of dry oakiness.

While I probably wouldn't buy my own bottle, my friend and I both agreed this was the best dram of the line-up."

4.25,"The aroma on the nose is predominantly vinous, decidedly Port: raisins, pecans, red fruits, orange peel. Malt in the form of butter biscuits is very present, over time it opens to hot scents of vanilla, caramel, a pinch of nutmeg and a herbaceous background, all harmonious and delicate.
The mouth is rather dry and hot, with chilli and spices that overlay dark chocolate, ripe fruit (apricots, apples, red fruits), hazelnuts, candied orange and malt. Touch of anise and wood in the background. A precarious balance that holds.
Medium length finish, of chili pepper, hazelnuts, orange peel, wood.
On the razor's edge, you expect it to slop at any moment, but it doesn't happen. The contribution of Portuguese wine barrels is on the edge of invasiveness, well supported by the body of the whisky, but reaffirms how difficult this marriage remains."
