5.0,"Smoke from the cask co-mingle with the oaky vanilla and creamy cereal malts giving way to dried black cherries, plums and apricots with flares of rye spice throughout.

Probably my favourite Canadian whiskey of all time. Too bad you can't buy this anymore and John Hall has only hinted that he'll be doing a third port cask finish..."
4.5,"Sweet and savoury excellent balance you don’t always see in a Canadian whiskey ! Wasn’t too sweet nice and flavourful, with a smooth and lingering finish loved it !! After tasting the unity blend this is way better much more refined and balanced not as sweet I would say unity is more of a dessert whiskey and this is an all around amazing whiskey"

5.0,I was lucky to get a bottle of this about 3 years ago. I am always looking to see if they remade it.
