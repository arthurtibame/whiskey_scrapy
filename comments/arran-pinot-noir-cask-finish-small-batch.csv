2.75,"Fruity with a light but distinct peat on the nose. Citrusy and slightly nutty. A round and smooth nose that is very friendly. Later there is some vanilla 

Very sweet and noticeably strong from the 55 ABV. The oak is really present but even though quite young it remains somewhat smooth. 

Water transforms most of the peat to actual smoke. The palate becomes really delicious when brought down to like 48 ABV. There it offers everything from sweet to sour over bitter to hot. Very round and interesting. I enjoyed it but it is a bid to much for me on the alcoholic intensity which overlays a lot of the actual taste."
