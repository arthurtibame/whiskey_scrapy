null,"Purchased two months ago in Lexington, KY. Notes then as now include light almond, vanilla, cinnamon-y flavors. Enjoy this but want to see how it plays after 1-2 years (if it makes it that long!). Would give it a B+/A-"

3.0,"I will be the first to say that I'm a sucker for some nice packaging, and this Cassius Clay Straight Bourbon is no exception, because how cool is that mini cannon on the stopper?! Released in October 2015, these guys are the new kids on the block in the world of craft distilling in the Tennessee/Kentucky region. On the nose, I get some mild caramel, molasses, and ethanol; not the most appetizing whiskey I've ever smelled, but certainly not the worst, either. It's got a warm mouth feel that's typical for a 100 proof, and I taste a pleasant candied apple tartness. Medium finish, and overall a decent pour. I'd give it a solid 85/100, and I'm looking forward to seeing what these guys put out in the future."

2.5,"On the nose, nothing to write home about. First taste, rough. A splash of water helps this one out quite a bit. Then you pick up a light almond caramel note that moves to a cinnamon spice finish. Tastes pretty young, finish is pretty quick. All in all, spend a few bucks more and get something with more depth. Perhaps good for mixing."
