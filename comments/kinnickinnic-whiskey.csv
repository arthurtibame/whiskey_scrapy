2.0,"Fantastic craft distillery doing big things in Milwaukee. A unique whiskey, this cut version was released early, and it shows. This whiskey is not very good. The sour, tobacco and charcoal-dominate finish is just not up to par for a sipper, let alone a mixer. Good news is according to Guy Rehorst, the master distiller, a lot more barrels have been aging and a new release is coming soon (if it’s not out already). Can’t wait to revisit this whiskey then, as I’m sure it will compliment the high quality gin and vodka Great Lakes Distillery is becoming known for. If you’re ever in Brew City, head down to the valley and take the tour."

3.0,"This is a good whisky for mixers where you want the whisky flavor to really stand out with sweet notes. This is perfect for an old fashioned. As a sipping whisky, you can taste the chocolate and coffee notes as well as the separate notes of bourbon and rye."

3.5,Smooth and woody. Light burn. Carmel notes. Nice aroma.
2.75,"Aroma is slightly sweet, hints of tobacco. Has a slightly harsh bite, over powers Whiskey flavor ever so slightly."
