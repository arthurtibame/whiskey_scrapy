4.5,A very light and lively Laphroaig with hints of trademark peat and sweet but carried forth on wisps of highland softness. Slightly less of a finish due to presumably heavy grain use in blend. But daring and different for Laphroaig lovers who seek a bit more fun in the dram. Like some of their lighter Cardias offerings but with greater complexity.
