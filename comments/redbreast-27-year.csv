5.0,"Nose- Light and delicate red fruits, fresh herbs, buttery shortbread cookies, nutmeg and cinnamon, wood spice, vanilla, blood orange

Palate- Fresh herbs initially, dark chocolate, nutmeg, raspberries, dates, peaches, rich vanilla, spiced oak 

Finish- Long, juicy finish with notes of wood spice, dark chocolate, deep, rich vanilla, and an unmistakable pineapple/mango note that really seals the deal



Astonishing. This may just be the best whiskey i’ve ever tried. Every aspect of it is fantastic and I have exactly 0 complaints. Perfect age, perfect proof, with so much going on. Complex is an understatement, I could drink 5 glasses of this and still be placing notes. The palate is absolutely perfect, and takes you through waves of different flavors and mouth-coating textures. The mango/pineapple I get at the very very end of the finish is unique, delicious, and perfectly balanced. 5/5 seems unfair."

4.75,Better than 25. Lingering powerful notes in the finish. Light on the nose.  Complex and beautiful.
