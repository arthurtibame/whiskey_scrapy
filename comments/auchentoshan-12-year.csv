3.5,"Edit: I’m bumping him up to 3.5 from 2.75, I’m having it again after experiencing more peat, and I am appreciating the hint of smoke in this guy more now. Very smooth, good sweetness, hint of smoke sets it off. Good stuff. 
It’s definitely peaty, but not much. I would drink a full pour for sure, but I was just able to have a sip."

2.5,"Overwhelming raisins, I will revisit this later but for now it is going in the back of the liquor cabinet. Regular price around $50 CAD, I much prefer the American Oak for the same price."
3.5,"Slight oak, peat and fruit on the nose, slight sherry and toffee on the palate, short oaky and spicy finish"

Palate:  Flowery, oily, barley, flowery

 Finish:  Lingers, palate hits you a second time

Very pleasant and easy to drink.  Adding water kills what’s “neat” about the whisky, but very drinkable."

3.5,"First Lowland scotch ive had. Had Famous Grouse smoky black in my hand and thought...every time I buy a blended scotch I bitch about the grain alcohol so I put it back and got this. Glad I did. Poured neat, nose is a melon bomb. Cantaloupe mainly but some honeydew as well. Holiday spices , sweet malt and honey as well, all very fresh. Palate delivers on the nose with a punch of malty melon with some spicy zest and gentle oak. Has some mandarin notes too as listed on bottle. This is a wonderful unique single malt! Finish is long with all the fruits hanging on with the malt, spice and honey oak. The oak does build through the dram. No off notes or bitterness arrive leaving a warm pleasant aftertaste. This is not a heavy hitter at 80 proof yet the flavors while thin are not lacking. Its on the lighter side(kinda Irish like) of the spectrum but anyone who enjoys scotch or Irish should give this a go............86/100.....easy drinking spicy and fruity delight."
3.75,"More depth than the 3, shorter note, enjoyable"
2.5,Sent super bon mais un peu trop piquant! Se rapproche du Macallan. Bien avec un repas salé. Au London Jack

3.25,"Well, that’s Auchentoshan for sure and I wonder if I should add anything to that as these Lowland malts are truly distinctive to anything you can get from the market.
The aroma has this sour/bitter carcass based on arrow-wood berries, lemon zest and some chemicals like nail polish or acetone which is the feature common to all of the Auchentoshan malts. Some of the components are similar to the ones of Three Wood but much less intense though the 12 yo has a pretty solid body itself. Also some raisins, prunes and plum jam to form the sweet yet pale shape.
The taste is sour sweet again - arrow-wood berries, red bilberries, both honeysuckle and honeyberries, blackcurrant leaves mixed with a newly-mown grass, citruses, raisins, caramel and a black pepper shade on a back of the tongue.
The finish is malty and a little bitter with many wooden/grain notes. Also some seasonings like thyme and coriander show up right before the taste completely vanishes from your mouth.
It really is closer to the fabulous Three Wood then to its “predecessor” - American Oak - thanks to the 12 years spent in the sherrie oak. Chemicals and polish just step aside here handing the leading role over to berries, caramel and raisins."

3.5,Fruity nose. Sweet smooth body. Bloody drinkable
3.5,"Auchentoshan 12 is one of those bottles that will forever be on my bar. It's inoffensive to new whisky drinkers and there's never a bad time to enjoy it as a veteran. It is just too easy to enjoy (unless you're hoping for puch-in-the-face peat). Aged in bourbon and sherry barrels, this mild dram offers a slight citrusy and toffee flavour that doesn't overstay its welcome. 8.5/10."
