4.0,Nose is very unique and I can’t put my finger on the aromas. There is a sweetness on the palette that lingers through the medium finish.
4.0,"Woody, nutty"

4.5,Nose: Leather and Nutty Taste: Leather and Crisp Finish: HOT warms you up at the end.
4.0,"I love double/triple cask or distilled spirits and this one hits the mark. However, I will also state that 9 out of 10 times I drink my bourbon neat but this one most definitely benefits from some water to mellow out the blend. If you like your bourbon room temperature, add several drops of water to ease the initial vibrance or the bourbon. A large ice cube will also suffice if you like your bourbon on the cooler side. Is it worth $100, meh, probably not. 

I would pair with ducle de lecce, anything caramel based, and a strong pasta (think rigatoni)."

3.5,Nose has a punch but you can pick up that great Cognac smell coming through. Let this open up for a bit and you will be ready to light a cigar and sit next to a roaring fireplace in a deep leather chair. A little varnish and leather on the taste with hints of flavor from the Sherry. Smooth going down but enough bite to keep you warm.
