2.0,I have been visiting family and one of them offered me a glass of Dewar's White Label and I do not know if it is me or if it is the scotch but I have a rough time drinking this liquid. I tried it neat and it was like drinking a sharp lightly smokey bit of anguish and pain. The face I made when I first drank it was not a good face. I just can't see how people drink this and feel good about themselves. Now my dad reminded me that different strokes for different folks so if you like Dewar's then good on you it is not in my wheelhouse right now. I am still looking for a Scotch to have as an everyday sipper and I will keep looking but this one is a no for me and as I write this I am being offered a glass of Glenmorangie Original so I will try this and see how that goes. If you like it drink it but I will look for something else.
2.75,"Honey, apples, alcohol and slight grain scent on nose.  Honey and spice on the palate.  Small hints of fruit.  Finish is spicy, which overwhelms the sweetness.  Big alcohol finish.  82."

Not too smoky

3.5,Precio es bueno el sabor es bueno pero de inicio tiene una nota alcoholica picante como la canela y el clavo pero después llega la vainilla y el caramelo se añeja 5 años en barrica y eso le aporta mucho cuerpo en la copa y es aceitocito en la boca muy rico

2.75,"Nose - apples, pears, honey, subtle peat smoke, moderate ethanol burn. 

Taste - caramel, vanilla, toffee, sweet cream, moderate ethanol burn, finishing quick with slight sweetness and hot, prickly alcohol notes you get from a younger whiskey.

Overall, this is not a complex whiskey and it tastes a bit young, but a decent budget dram for under $30 a bottle."

2.5,"I typically have a large bottle of blended scotch that I use as a daily drinker, almost a guard bottle for the better stuff. This is the first time I purchased Dewars White, and although I will finish this bottle no problem I won't buy it again. It's very mediocre, nothing special at all, in fact I am struggling to find anything I particularly like about it. 

On a blind taste test I am not sure I would be able to pick it out from any of the other blends, but next time I will be probably going back to Ballantine's Finest, or Whyte & Mackay special blend. Specificallly the Ballantine's has a lot more going on flavour wise (chocolate, leather, old books, etc.) 

Price noted, $34 is for a large 1.14 litre bottle at the BC Gov Liquor Store."
3.5,"A world classic, this is the first time i taste it i have to confess. And i got to say it is a little bit boring, with some remarks that helps this dram. Light gold  watery color. Bottled at 40% abv. 

On the nose you geat a beautiful mild peatyness, better than the stinky Johnnie Walker Red label, after a few seconds you will find Plum and Orange. As time passes Citrus aromas take the lead.

The aroma is simple but plessant. There is suppossed to be honey in there but i can't pervceive it.

Suprisingly good at the first taste, it is
Sweet and spicy. The honey is there. Finish is medium with a hint of peat. Medium bodied. Pleasant and enjoyable.

There is a mild hot kick right before the swallow.

Overall it is nice but way to simple. I added water to discover something else, i killed it. I dont usually add water to any whisky. I did it to find something else, but now is water in a glass, all flavor is lost now. I believe this is suitable for sweet cocktails."

3.0,Light sweet aroma and taste
4.0,Very light color. Almost looks like apple juice. Nose is light but flagrant. Pleasant actually. Surprisingly smooth to swallow with a tiny bite after. Tongue tingles slightly between tip and half mast. Can’t quite place the flavors present but it is amazingly pleasant.

2.25,"I started drinking Dewar's White Label sometime around 1984, so this is a pretty familiar scotch to me.  For a long, long time it was my daily drinker.  As my available funds became a bit more flexible, my tastes changed and I progressed to single malts, bourbons and, my favorite, rye.  But when I'm up against the wall and White Label is all that's to hand, I have no problems with it.  

This taste was courtesy of American Airlines at 32,000 feet.  Served on ice. At least it was a real glass.

Dewar's is okay.  It tastes like grain alcohol with a few drops of a smokey something or other in there.  It's like a real scotch whisky only without all the complexity, aroma and taste.  Scotch from a fast food restaurant would taste like this. My favorite way to enjoy Dewar's White Label is 50/50 with soda.  

White Label has a bit of an antiseptic note that I'm not particularly happy with.  It's less noticeable when served on the rocks, and it goes without saying that this particular whisky isn't intended to be drunk neat.  

This might not sound like a reverberating endorsement, but the truth is there are worse things one could find in one's glass.  Like the other white label - Jim Beam - this is just a working class dram.  It's not a world beater and it doesn't offend my taste buds.  It's the 8th best selling scotch in the world at 2.8+ million  cases (according to The Spirits Business web site), and that has to count for something.

In my world an average nothing-special bottle that's available everywhere nets a 2.5 rating. right in the middle of the bell curve.  Dewar's White Label is running with the pack, although I docked it a quarter point based on price.  It seems like its just a bit more expensive than it ought to be.  

You won't find White Label in my liquor cabinet, but I'm happy to have it on a flight...."

2.5,"Neat: more of a sweet corn/Bourbon malt initial taste to me. The peat doesn't seem to be that prevalent. In fact, the smoke is more like cigarette ashes than a fine cigar tobacco leaf.

With a droplet: the burn mellows out but it's still ASHY. Vanilla comes out a bit. Seem like an off-blend of disparate elements that don't quite mesh."

3.25,"This Scotch needs more credit in my opinion, slightly longer hotter finish than  JWB. A tad thinner. Vanilla honey tones. I enjoyed it. Nice mild peat smoke. No bad flavors to speak of. Will buy again."

1.25,"An easy, non offending blended scotch whisk(e)y, but nothing special. 
The nose is iodine with light peaty smoke with a tiny bit of floral. Not an overly appetizing start.

Palate is light and thin with those same nose flavours and not initially very enjoyable. Midway through there is a little sweetness and whisper of smoke. This does improve the overall drinkability however,  and the finish is very dry with some bitter wood notes.

It does not hold up well to water or ice, but with this proof you probably wouldn’t go there anyway. Even though this is a budget scotch that is cheap and plentiful, this is not what you want to buy if you are trying to explore or get your friends into the segment. It will probably turn them away."

2.75,"An okay budget scotch, would spring for Monkey Shoulder instead.

Nose: honey, almonds, herbal tea
Taste: honey, light smoke, black pepper

Plain overall, would get for mixing or introducing a friend or guest to scotch or whisky

3.0,"Metallic and slightly sour on the nose, the light smoke comes through on the palate but doesn’t stay til the finish. Very short finish."
1.75,"The nose is surprisingly peaty, with some smoke and sugar hanging out too.
It tastes really smokey and peaty with a strong mineral backing and a generic sweetness to it. There is a bit of caramel there to save it but the peat and mineral flavors really do the drink a serious disservice. The floral notes are strong and they mix with the alcohol flavor (which admittedly does not overwhelm) in a gross way. The mildness is unappealing like Glenlivet 12, but then the other flavors are stacked atop it. The flavors do not blend well, but the saving grace is that having several of them helps to mask the alcohol and adds just a bit of interest. There is some red fruit hiding out behind the mineral and floral flavors, but it doesn't help much. Salt and sea-spray are there too, adding to the complexity but not substantially improving the drink. This is not really sippable unless you're desperate. This scotch blends flavors from across Scotland in a way that is thoroughly unappealing."
