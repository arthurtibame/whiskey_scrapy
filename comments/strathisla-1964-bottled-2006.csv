4.75,"Instant pruney, port nose. Intense, plummy, dark fruit. Cloves in citrus. Maple. Plaster. Light wafty wood smoke. Sweet, meaty nose. Turpentine. Hoisin, slightly savory edge. Maybe some bitter chocolate. 

Palate has a savory edge. Pruney sherry flavour is there, but it’s undercut by this mellow, caramely wood note that’s so deep. Not like anything I’ve tasted before. So rich, fatty but not mouth coating. Spiced fruits/mulling spices. Maybe some spiced citrus. Thick cough syrup. Licorice. Aniseed. Syrupy as it develops over the palate. 

Finish is slightly savory. Prunes in syrup, lightest bit of smoke. Maybe a little herbal and tangy."
