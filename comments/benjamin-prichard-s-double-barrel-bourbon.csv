4.0,"33 open bottles in my collection ranked through multiple blind tastings.  Counting them down!

#22: Benjamin Prichard’s Double Barreled.  Bourbon.  45% ABV.  NAS, but states aged a minimum of 8 years.
Paid $104
Overpaid.  Regrettable purchase.

At $100, I should be able to get a good cask strength bourbon.  Prichard’s gimmick here is that they age in charred new oak for 8 years, cut from 125 to 95 proof, and then age a second undisclosed length of time in charred new oak.  This is supposed to return the flavor lost during the cut, while remaining true to bourbon because the company specifically lashes out at wine finishes.  1) Wine finished bourbons (and ryes) can be delicious.  2) Whatever this second aging does, I would prefer just giving me one 8 year maturation at cask strength.  Having said that, this does have more depth and richness than the average bourbon at $30-40.  Very honeyed and candied on the nose and palette.  There’s a decadent spicy molasses on the finish.  But it’s rather simple for the price, and this countdown has two much better bourbons for around half the price.

MARK: 87/100

PREVIOUSLY, ON BATMAN:
#23: High West Campfire.  $62.  46%.  NAS.  86/100.
#24: Balvenie Single Barrel First Fill.  $59.  47.8%.  12 years.  86/100.
#25: Bulleit Barrel Strength Batch 5.  $55.  62.7%.  NAS.  84/100
#26: Glenkinchie Distiller’s Edition.  $46.  43%.  2004/2016.  83/100.
#27: Macallan Sherry Oak. $66.  43%.  12 years.  82/100."
