4.0,A good mate brought a bottle of the chipher over  last night for a drink. We really enjoyed this & had a bit of fun comparing our tasting notes. On the nose vanilla sweet floral a touch of sherry. The palate more sweetness honey & a little caramel at some stage this definitely spent some time in sherry casks as you can taste it. The finish was pleasantly long & warm. I really enjoyed this & might get another bottle for the collection

4.0,"I had a sample of this on Sunday night, purchased through my travels, in one of the small 5cl sizes.   I just hate the opaque marketing strategy in this: "" we wont' tell you the age, or the cask type, or anything at all but after purchase, you can go to our website and find out"".  I'm either too jaded or just too flippant at this point to do that.  Which is why I only bought a sample and not the whole bottle...curious enough, but not too curious to bother with that opaque marketing.  That be said...this is pretty good.  I so wanted to hate this, just to stick it to the marketing, but I actually liked it.  It's honey, honey, and more honey.  Specifically...Slovenian Radovljica honey made from the linden tree.  Yes.  Really.  I remember I loved it so much, I bought some back from Ljublana (side note: one of the cutest small cities you can go to!).  The palette is more honey, followed by cinnamon and mint.  But, emphasis again on honey.   I'm not going to bother with the website or getting a full bottle (just out of spite), but if I were to venture a guess...I'd say  first fill bourbon barrels, aged around 15 years."

4.0,"this whisky is quite a sense of fantastic. The nose to finish are all the Glenlivet characteristics. Vanilla, honey and more. Will update notes when I get to inspect more then 1oz sample."

Palate: dried fruits - apples and pears, baking spices - nutmeg and cinnamon?, hints of toffee

Beautifully complex. Sweet and spice. Every nice!!"
