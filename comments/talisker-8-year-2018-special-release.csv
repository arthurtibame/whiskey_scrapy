4.0,"This was one of more than two dozen whiskies I tasted Saturday at The Whisky Show London, by far the best event of its kind that I've been to. I happened to be in town this weekend and was lucky enough to get a ticket from the show's wait list, as it was sold out officially. 

I keep promising to swear off these shows as they really are the antithesis of the art of whisky appreciation, but the sensible price and fantasy pour list made this one hard to resist. It was as if The Whisky Exchange had just thrown open its doors and invited everyone to dive in. Every distiller you can think of was there, pouring their top tier drams, alongside all the great independent bottlers. It's a measure of how hard it was to narrow down the 600+ choices that I all but ignored the Pappy stand.

Of course, sensible tasting notes are impossible under these circumstances, but I will attempt to get a few up alongside a slew of four and five star ratings. With so much choice, it was easy to avoid the merely good whiskies.

The Talisker 8 was surprisingly smooth at its cask strength and as distinct from the 10 as that one is from the 18. The dominant flavor was Nutella. Yes, chocolate and hazelnut. Beyond that, I have nothing useful to report for now, though I did bring a bottle back for a colleague. Perhaps he'll share."

4.5,"When talking about peaty whiskies, Talisker is my go-to dram. I had the opportunity to taste this young expression which has been bottled at a high abv of 59.4% to just punch you in the face. This is a special 2018 release from Diageo. 

On the nose: Inmidiate peat with orange. Dry grass burning, Hay burning. Toffee. Lemon after first sip. Dulce de leche. 

On the palate, it is a Wonderful dram.Toffee is surrounded with peat. Pepper is coming up.

Its like a higher abv talisker.... wait!
Toffees and peat.

Aftertaste is the best part of this rewarding whisky. Ashes, Bonfire. Salty. It Burned my mouth forever, but in a pleasant way.

Overall this, as all Taliskers, is a great whisky. It gives you all the flavor you want, with that typical profile from this distillery. 90 over 100. Amazing."
4.75,Amazing combination of candied fruit and smoke on the nose. More of the same plus extra citrus on the palate. Then a medium finish to boot!
4.75,"After 2 weeks in Iceland without any whisky (or any alcohol for that matter—-it’s so freakin’ expensive there!!), I finally got back home and opened up this sample sent by my buddy @LeeEvolved .   

So, after letting it sit out a bit, while catching up on some Hassan Minhaj and John Oliver, I took a sip.  My first reaction was “ damn it...I CAN’T believe I got one at $50, and then sold it (was trying to reduce some bottles in my collection, and foolishly thought a young Talisker can’t be all that good) for $60!!”   What the hell was I thinking?  Dumbass.  At $50 when it first came out, I should’ve bought a few.   This is now unfortunately hard to get except at sky high prices in auction. 

It’s 2 years younger than the 10, but acts a few years older.  Closer to 18, but CS.  You get meaty, salty notes, like a butcher shop next to an ocean.  Then comes the classic Talisker pepper, but more brutish.  Talisker at cask strength is as rough as it gets, but wow, this walks an amazing tightrope between rough and elegant.    It’s what the 10 aspires to be.  

 This is simply an amazing must buy at the original $50 price.  I don’t know what secondary pricing is now, but I’m guessing well over $150.  I’d not be a buyer of it over $90, because I can get the Corry or Uigi and be just almost as satisfied.  But at $50...pull up a truck ( damn it, can’t believe I sold mine!!), it’s a steal.  

Solid 4.5 stars with a bump up considering original $50 pricing.  

Did I mention how upset I am selling mine?"
4.5,"4.4 average rating albeit from 12 reviews screams amazing. It's a lovely dram. With liberal dosing of water and time...marmalade, white pepper, sweet vanilla heavy salty peat bursts forward. Lighter and more refined than the 10, like it's older than it is. I'd say I'm in love....does it get to the top echelons of whiskies... Initially a 4 I thought..then definitely a 4.25  then definately a 4.5..this just gets better and better with time. Is it on par with the 10..yes..different but on par I thought.  I cracked open the 10 to compare....definately the 8 yr wins on the nose. Palate it's a hard one..the 10 is richer but slightly harsher although it hasn't had the advantage of time open...the 8 year so full of flavour and refinement. The 10 is a fraction of the price so even if the 8 takes it in pure taste then once vfm is factored in then it's a draw. The 8 yr is what I wish the 18 had been (I definitely got a dud bottle). Again a great example of older isn't better as it smokes the (dud) 18 and 25 yr bottles and drams I had. 4.5 it is...maybe 4.75....if I could get hold of a bottle I'd buy it (a rarity these days). Make sure you give this one water and time sitting in the glass to get the most out if it."

4.0,"Needs some water to soften, maybe a few drops. Then it’s cereal and nuts and chocolate and lemon peel and orange marmalade and spicy cloves. It’s moreish, and intriguing to sniff. Has a nice balance of subtle smoke and sweetness. Pretty serious stuff. Very enjoyable."
5.0,Simply superb! Slightly softer on the peat compared to the 10 but what a mouthful of OMFG this is good!
