3.0,"Light colored, fairly thin. Tastes like a whiskey spin on Okinawan Awamori I've had in the past. Sharp and bright, especially into the tail. I can't pick out flavors beyond cedar and that shochu aroma. It's alright, mostly gets points for originality. It's not often whiskey makes me think of Okinawa."
