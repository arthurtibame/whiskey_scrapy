4.0,"Vanilla, raisins and toasted cereal on the nose. The palate is fruity and bright with pineapples, lemon peel and berries coming through. The finish is sweet and somewhat short, but very good overall. Worth a try."
4.0,"Very good whisky, though I'm frankly surprised it's described as a peated expression. In PPM value, I would have to describe it as -2. It's barely even there. That said, it all comes together really nice: some walnut, a touch of lemon zest, some spice. And at 46% ABV you really get something that has great mouthfeel. I recommend if you can get your hands on a bottle."
