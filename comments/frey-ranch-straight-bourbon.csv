3.5,Nice. Smooth. Lacks in complexity.  Sweet finish.
4.25,"I can’t say enough about Frey Ranch. I picked up one to try and bought several more after the first drink. 

Not a very high proof, but the extreme heat in Nevada summers must do something special with the juice in the barrels (think: Garrison Bros out of Texas). Would love to try it in the 100-107 range, I think it would be a 5-star bottle. 

I get honey and honeysuckle on the nose, not a lot of oak but some char, and the obvious vanilla notes. Palate is strikingly smooth (only 90-proof) with vanilla and some spice, but being a four grain it coats the whole tongue. I mean the whole tongue. Very pleasant. For only being 4-5 years old, very little, if any, corn flavors like you get from other young bourbons. 

The finish is smooth with a hint of dry leather and some earthy tones. Stellar first bottle, I think Frey Ranch will do great things."
