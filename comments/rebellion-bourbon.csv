1.0,An absolute oak monster. Not a pleasant tasting experience for me.
null,Nose is sweet with a hint of spice. Starts out a little flat but finishes strong with a peppery note. Hints of leather and oil. Surprised at the strong strong taste given the proof.

2.75,A bit  too much burn for my tastes.  Smells like a cheap bourbon.
2.0,"Nose: sweet corn, light vanilla and slight spice 

Palate: faint all across the board...  slight sweetness, spice and warming the ethanol taste

Finish: ethanol warmth and spice 

Only good as a well bourbon to add to a cocktail because of the proof, lacks real flavor"

2.0,Strong corn / grain/ Karo corn syrup on the nose and palate. A lot of alcohol burn and bitterness on the palate. Better whiskeys for the price.
