3.0,"Nose is cherry, fruit, fresh hay. Slight citrus underneath. Orange peel comes with the first taste with nutmeg hints of leather. Even with 4 years in oak it tastes very young. Rye comes in the finish with white pepper and baking spices.
DSP-KY-1 bottled KY-31
Comment***Tasted w/Evan W BIB***drier w/ more citrus than EW Of course both H Hill, same BIB, same color, but slightly different taste and finish

5.0,"After dutifully finishing out a few 7-10 year bourbons I wasn't crazy about, I got to the J.W. Dant. I was kind of bummed after reading reviews and comments. Then I open the bottle. I put it right in the list with my favorites. I went back to it three times in a row, leaving the Weller unopened on deck. It bothered me. I kept thinking Dant would probably do well in a blind tasting. One Google search later got me to the Bourbonr article where 15 pros blind taste J.W. Dant vs Elijah 12 and Elijah 18. And the winner is..."

3.0,The modern dant is a really great Pour for the money would recommend anyone who lives near Kentucky . However the Pre-fire dant is a thing of gold if judging that I would give it a solid 5 stars and a 97 out of 100 and that's saying something!

4.5,Mini from the 50’s.  Spice and caramel on the nose is light.  This is a caramel bomb on the palate.  Has great finesse and balance.  Then it dries out on the finish with leather notes.  Awesome.

4.5,"For the price it’s hard to beat! 

This drink can easily be used as a mixer, but more importantly, can be drank neat as well. 

It does have a bit more of an alcohol taste when drunk neat, but you still get sweet corn notes along with Caramel. The finish is quite long, which is both enjoyable and impressive for a $20 bottle. Overall I think I will put this on my favorite list for both cost and overall performance."
4.25,"This is flat out good bourbon. Reminds me of Evan Williams white label. Surprised by the lack of pub for this one. Solid oak flavors, vanilla on the finish."
4.0,"Picking up leather, tobacco and char on the nose.  Tinned fruits, tobacco, kind of nutty and oaky on the pallete.  Slightly oily mouthfeel but dries out quickly.  Finish is warming and somewhat lengthy but only on the pallete, does not follow down the throat."

null,"Nose: Sweet peach, dusty corn, cinnamon candy, salted caramel, and green wood notes push out a little aggressively. Young corn notes are there, but there seems to be enough spice to help push it past.

Palate: Fruit notes pop on a lighter mouthfeel. Cinnamon spice starts to spike while musty barrel notes surface.

Finish: Cinnamon forward with sweet corn and caramel notes pushing towards the back of the palate. 

Great budget bourbon. I drank this alongside Fighting Cock, and the corn notes were definitely apparent. Yes, this is young, but it really holds its own."
4.75,"Tasting notes feel pretentious and unnecessary in this context, and I worry that the producer will realize the good thing they have going and jack the price. Nevertheless--J.W. Dant is the best whiskey you can buy in America for under $20. Full stop. 

Is it perfect? No. But it sips well neat with some time to breathe, holds up super well to ice on a hot day, and makes for a fabulous spirit forward cocktail. Tastes of . . . what bourbon should taste of. The nearest store to me that stocks it is 1.5 hours away and I grab 2-3 bottles any time I pass through, just to keep as my ""well"" whiskey."

3.0,"Fairly smooth, with a strong spice flavor mixed with Vanilla, Caramel and heavy oak. Finish last a while but it’s a lovely burn."
4.0,"BACKGROUND: Joseph Washington Dant began his career working as a blacksmith, but by the mid-1830s, he was a distiller who invented the process  to make bourbon with hollowed out tree trunks.

Let me state that once again so you can fully comprehend the concept - J.W. Dant figured out how to make bourbon from trees.  How is this sumbitch not celebrated with great inventors like Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, and the Wright Brothers?!?!?!

Dant’s distilling method, which was used by farmers and pioneers who could not afford a copper still, required a log to be split lengthwise, hollowed out, and then bound tightly back together. 

The log was then stood vertically and filled from the top with fermented mash.  A lid with a coil, similar in shape to a Hershey’s Kiss, would be placed atop the log, but, sometimes, only a thick blanket was used to cover the top.  Small pipes that had been driven through the log would then have steam fed through them, which would begin the distillation process with the tree trunk replacing the boiler, or pot.

Known at the time as the only log distiller whose product was worthy of purchase, Dant grew and used his own grains, and, by 1860, his bourbon operation encompassed almost 200 acres.  He retired in the 1880s and passed away in 1902 at age 82.
Dant left behind two sons who became distillers, one of whom invented the Yellowstone brand, and production of J.W. Dant bourbon continued until Prohibition forced it to cease.  Following passage of the 21st Amendment, the rights to the J.W. Dant trademark passed through several distilleries before being finally acquired in 1993 by Heaven Hill, which holds them today.

The modern version of J.W. Dant is produced using Heaven Hill’s standard mashbill of 78% corn, 10% rye, and 12% malted barley, and a #3 char is placed on the barrel staves for aging.

Long considered a bottom shelf bourbon, it costs only $15.99 for a one liter bottle, and the brand does not even have its own website, nor is there any mention made of it on the Heaven Hill Distillery’s brand listing page.

NOSE: The nose offers a mix of banana scent, which is more commonly associated with Brown Forman products, the corn dust aroma that you often get when opening a new bag of wild bird seed, and caramel.  A strong smell of barrel - not a general oak note like most bourbons but deeply burned barrel char - is present, and a bit of ethanol sting invades the nose even with an open mouth.

PALATE: The palate begins with a strong burst of nicely sweet caramel, and it is quickly followed by distinct corn notes along with a delightful flavor that tastes exactly like I.B.C. root beer from a bottle.  For a bottom shelf bourbon, it offers a mid-to-upper shelf palate.

FINISH: Initial oak on the finish is soon overcome by a growing burst of intense and spicy rye mint.  Some reviewers complain that the finish is drying, but mine had none of that effect.  It is a long finish, but also just a tad bit hot.  Dant’s rich, syrupy mouth feel that coats the jaw is something you would more often expect to find on a higher-end bourbon.

FINAL ASSESSMENT:  Just so all of my cards are on the table, I am a fan of Heaven Hill products, and I simply love bottled in bond bourbons.  In fact, I do not think I have ever sampled a truly bad bottled in bond offering from any producer.  

J.W. Dant Bottled In Bond will not knock your socks off, but it is a dependable workhorse that will not let you down.  Each sip was progressively better than the one that preceded it, and I could easily drink this every day and be wholly satisfied.  It ain’t complex, but, darn, it is good.

Early Times Bottled In Bond deservedly gets much love among aficionados as a surprisingly inexpensive yet high-quality bourbon, but I rank J.W. Dant alongside it as one of the best values on any shelf from top to bottom."
4.0,"For those like myself who are struggling during this pandemic called Covid 19, I'm in the midst of finding all the BIB's I can get my hands on. Why? Well, this used to be the gold standard as you could get a true proof with enough years to garner actual flavor. So today, I've taken the time to save my wallet amd to add a nicely needed buzz to my week. Thanks 100 proof...

Nose... A vanilla ice cream packed sundae. It's a cliche if you've read my others, but its true. Add in a few green apple slices, some peanut butter, buttery more than peanuty, and you've got a warm dessert in liquid form. Depending on how open you get this bourbon, you might even find darker fruits like raisins and prunes.

Color.... Slightly under mahogany, which is in my realm of trust.

Taste.... Butter, butter, corn, salted roasted movie theatre popcorn. Soon enough, slight pepper and dry leather, and most importantly, the actual cask. That's a gift...

Overall.... Either I'm sucummbimg to lower prices or I, like numerous others, have been dealt with a full on branch out circumstance. My cash flow is low, but BiB will be my saving grace. If I manage, then the BIB category will become my saving grace...."

4.25,Drinks like a higher dollar bottle
3.75,"Nose: spicy, a little fruit. Lots of ethanol in the third take. A little bready too and loads of cinnamon

Palate: spicy and pungent. Hardly any burn. Sweet but not fruity. Peppery like wild turkey. 

Finish: short and peppery"
