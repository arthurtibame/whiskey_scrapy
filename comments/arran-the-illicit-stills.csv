4.0,"My favorite in the series and proof that Arran can do wonderful things with peat.

The nose is full of stewed stone fruits, clean cotton, and old dry hardwood.
The palate is defined by its spiciness, white and black pepper hit you right away.  Hiding further back is creamy oak and ripe berries.
The finish is long and lingering with a fruity jam enriched with spicy chili pepper."
