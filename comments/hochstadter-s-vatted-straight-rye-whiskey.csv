4.0,solid rye. bold flavor and suprisingly smooth. definitely worth $35 and a spot in your collection. not quite sazerac or rittenhouse but not too far off either.

4.75,"Cinnamon, mint, butter, caramel, clove. Creamy full body with some cocoa on the finish. Busy and satisfying with every sip offering something new."

2.0,"Have you had a standard, floral rye, that would go great in a mixed drink? Then you've had this. Very pleasant, smooth for the proof. Not complex, but an easy sipper. 8/17/18"
4.0,"Very sweet and fruity aroma of apples and pears with a slight spice at the end.

Sweet taste with fruit and caramel slight spice at the end, 
For 100 proof, not too much of a bite at all, very smooth and enjoyable even neat.

A nice sipping rye for sure, neat."

4.0,"A solid, well-rounded whiskey that is both nicely spiced and wonderfully sweet; this one grows on you fast. (Note: Makes for a great Manhattan, especially when mixed with Cocchi vermouth. Excellent in a Sazerac as well.)"

3.5,Great rye. Maybe better on rocks. Will try again. Definitely great cocktail rye.
4.5,Bold and spicy
4.25,"N: Sweet vanilla and baking spice
P: Spice bomb. Gingerbread. It's Christmas in a drink.
F: Long and flavorful. Slight char with the continued spice."

3.5,"For something that is a hundred proof, it drinks much closer to 80 or 90 Proof. I'd go so far as to call it light and refreshing with almost no burn and a thinner body (but not in an off-putting way).

Nose- caramel, fresh cut grass, green tea with brown sugar. Reminds me a bit of fake nature smell (like a scented spray), but I don't mind too much.

Flavorwise- lower on the rye spice scale than some, but more than something like Old Overholt, for instance.  Grassy, somewhat peppery, green and leafy.  Tobacco and a touch of leather round out the medium finish. 

Overall- a pleasant enough sipper but lacking in depth, mouthfeel, and character.  I could easily drink this when in conversation with friends or with dinner, but I'd want something more if I were giving it my undivided attention."
