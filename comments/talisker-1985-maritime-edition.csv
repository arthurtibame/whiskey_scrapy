4.5,"This was my favorite Talisker until I tried their 2005 bottling of a 25 year old at cask strength.  I have bottle 0719 of 3000.  The packaging is the packaging.  I am confused why Diageo has decided to equate Talisker’s “Made by the Sea” slogan with boating.  Whatever.  I am not drinking this on a boat.  I am not learning nautical signs.  Tell me about the whisky inside.

It’s cask strength at 56.1%.  Most of it is aged in American oak refill hogsheads.  The vintage is 1985.  This was bottled in 2013.  This package comes with a little book, and that’s all the relevant info we get about the actual liquid.  Fortunately, the liquid is exquisite.

This is very maritime indeed with lots of salt, fish, seaweed, and lime on the nose.  On the palate, this is insanely spicy.  Imagine sprinkling chili flakes on dark chocolate; or putting out your cigar in chili oil.  There’s white pepper, fennel, eucalyptus, and still plenty of seaweed umami.  Surprisingly, at 27 years, I still get malt and saltine crackers.  The mouthfeel is silky and ethereal.  Compared to the 2005 cask strength Talisker, this 2013 bottling is noticeably not as fruity or earthy.  There is some peach and nectarine notes, but there is no bright burst of fruit that I got with the 2005.  The finish is ashy and leathery.  There is a tad soapiness, but in a fitting seawater kind of way.

I got this bottle on sale at $525.  At that price, I am satisfied.  However, if the 25 year old 2005 bottling is offered at the same price as this 27 year old 2013 bottling, choose the former without hesitation.

Score: *** (I am not worthy) 
How much does a bottle cost: $550-800 and still available
How much do I think a bottle is worth: $550"
