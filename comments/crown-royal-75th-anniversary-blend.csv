2.0,"I simply don't get it. Nose is nice enough, but very thin and light on the palate. To call this smooth is an understatement.  I keep trying to figure out what I'm missing, perhaps I have been drinking too many whiskys in the north of 100 proof range!"

3.0,Birthday gift! Hints of crown but much smoother
2.0,"Nose is unripe fruit and refined sugar. Palate has vanilla, caramel, and cinnamon chewing gum. This one is sweet on sweet but in a slightly off-putting way."

3.0,"This is typical sweet Crown, although was a little disappointing. I really like the Crown Reserve over a little ice and the 75th just doesn't seem to hold up as well. It's smooth, although lacks the peppery flavor I expected from the added rye. At $60 for 750ml, I'll stick with the reserve. The 75 does have a cool silver bag though!"

4.0,"Strong fruit and pleasant spice, both on the nose and palate. Signature Crown Royal smoothness, but the flavor is not tame. Good level of sweetness, an acidic kick that fits well with the fruit, and a slight smokiness that rounds out the profile. Decent warmth going down. This is a great pour. 5/27/17"

3.0,"Crown Royal made this as their 75th anniversary, one time release, to celebrate a visit by British royalty.  Only available in the US...not sure the logic behind that though.  I would've thought at least they'd have this available in Canada as well.   This isn't bad...just not quite up to par to their Hand Selection (good), or Noble Collection (better).   This felt like a watered down version of their Noble Collection.  Less flavor, less oomph, less of everything except the price tag.  Save your money, and go for one of those instead."

4.0,"I think of it as a very smooth American rye even though its from a truly classic Canadian producer. Clean and rich with a sweet undertone and a bit of light fruit. What stands out to me is the barely rough rye spice that gives this whiskey real character. Think ""leather smooth"" not ""silky smooth"". An enjoyable drink neat especially as a change of pace from bourbon. Can be had for $35 these days where I am and its well worth that price. Your cost may vary - MSRP was originally much higher."

3.0,"When it comes to blended whiskies, crown royal is my go-to, but frankly this one is kind of underwhelming. It's not bad, but just didn't wow me like I expected. 

3 stars because there's many tastier for the price. Go for the reserve, XO or XR instead."

4.0,"The more of this I drink, the more I’m enjoying it. It’s more complex than standard crown and that threw me off on initial tasting. Higher rye content and spicer. It’s been a tasty sipping whisky with a good medium bodied cigar."
