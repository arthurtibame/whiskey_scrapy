1.0,"Nose: Mustard oil smell, Taste: Smooth at first, but in a oily type of way. I cannot drink this! Yuck."
2.0,"Perfumed nose, like nail polish.  Subtle mild honey flavor that gives rise to a spicy bite.  A bitter and synthetic liqueur flavoring on the finish.  I feel a little coating residue, for better or for worse.  For the hell of it, a splash of water helps tie all of these elements together, but doesn't necessarily make it any better.   In my experience I find this rather original.  Not my preferred taste, but I don't hate it either."
1.0,Very strange. Floral and fruity competing with chemical solvent. Ultimately the solvent won out. First time I've poured out a partial glass of whiskey.

2.0,"Lots of clementine and orange on the nose along with something like pine sap. The palate is surprisingly smooth but more of the same orange flavor. Floral notes and again just a tinge of what I would think Pinesol would taste like. This is a big step toward the Rock & Rye liqueur. other than for use as a mixer in an old fashioned or something like that, I'd definitely not buy this."

null,"Excellent whiskey, hard to find in PA. It starts with a sweet floral taste and leaves no afterburn and very smooth finish. I would rate it higher than distillers 74. I would rate it 83."

2.0,"Too much acetone and other chemical notes - overpowered the subtle caramel and vanilla.  Smooth and slightly sweet, but the flavors don't do it for me"

3.25,"Nose:
Not unpleasant ethanol 
Green Apple
Shortbread
Caramel

Taste:
Very barrely, intense oak on the tip of the tongue then sharp bitterness as it slides off the sides. Not necessarily tannin, though. 
Back of the tongue reacts as if just ate very salty food
Oily, buttery mouthfeel
Smooth, dry finish on top of tongue

Overall a really interesting whiskey.  I think it could do with a little more sweetness, which could maybe be achieved by more barrel time. I don't know if I would want to mess with the weird, not unpleasant saltiness (not that it's actually salty, but my tongue reacts like it's salty), though, which would probably mellow out if left in the barrel longer.  I was initially uncertain about the low proof, but it works.  Feels and sort of noses like a pot still Irish whiskey."

4.0,It's not for everyone. A unique whiskey made mostly of millet. Spicy sweet cereal notes make it perfect for breakfast.

4.0,"This is a majorly unique whiskey. I'm reminded of kümmel, actually - nose and palate both are reminiscent of rye bread with caraway seeds, plus dill and orange peel. There's a little ginger on the palate, too. I see why some really don't like this, but this is a flavor palate that's well within my Alsatian ancestry wheelhouse."

5.0,"My favorite craft whiskey (and producer) on the market! It has a refined, herbal edge."
2.0,"Nose is like a freshly painted room.  If you're into,that, this is right up your alley.  Taste is a bit weird.  Not bad, just weird.  As if you ate a strawberry and then licked paint.  Finish is a bit of burn, and more paint.  Not sure I'd buy a bottle of this.  Glad I just had a sample.  Just weird.  Really weird.
EDIT:  I tried to give this 'two stars', but it forces a five stars.  Distiller bug?"
