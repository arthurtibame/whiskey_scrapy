4.5,"Interesting. Great hints of sweetness of rum w/o being sweet. Orange definitely, some say coconut"
3.5,"I tried this on a whiskey tasting session with the Teeling ambassador. This is Plantation Rum finished version of the original Teeling Small Batch blended whiskey. Available in selected countries in Europe only. Nose: very nice, fruity. Palate and finish: fruity and spicey. For me more friendly than the original version, but still too harsh at the end, with much more spices than i would expect based on the nose."
