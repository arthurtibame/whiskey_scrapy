2.5,"Visited the distillery in San Antonio. This bourbon has some promise, but there was a funky, beery quality to it that reminded me of dry breakfast cereal, and beyond that it was a one note bourbon. None of the usual caramel, brown sugar, cherry, or oak flavors. This one just came out as of 2019, so I’d be interested to see what another year or two in the barrel will do to this whisky, but for now it doesn’t do much for me."
4.0,"Heavy pour with one ice cube. Sweet up front with cherries, vanilla, and candied pecans. Closes hot and a bit spicy with clove, pepper, and nutmeg. Very enjoyable, but probably could have used another rock."
2.0,A little too sweet for my taste
