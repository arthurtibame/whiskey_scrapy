null,Maple syrup is heavy in this one. Oak is medium to heavy. Overall sweet. Not much malt presence besides rye spice. Good entry whiskey for whiskey sour drinkers.

4.0,"Powerful maple, floral and spice nose. First taste is sweet, with crisp berry and spice flavors. Big body that can at times be overpowering. Finishes with warm spice and vanilla."

5.0,"This is a fine, fine whiskey. I add just a touch of cold water, and that brings out a nice flavor. Give it a try and you will not regret it. This will be on my shelf...I also live in Missouri so it was waiting for me at Brown Derby International. This is a freely given endorsement of quality staff."

4.0,This is a solid whiskey. Strong maple flavor with some alcohol bite on the palate that doesn't overpower. Great for a dessert drink.

3.0,"Do you like pancakes? Nice, fluffy ones with plenty of butter and real maple syrup, but with enough whole wheat in the batter to give a light bitterness to the finish? Then drink some of this. The maple syrup character is on the nose, along with an herbal quality and a touch of caramel and spice. Maple is, again, on the fittingly thick palate, with red berries, spices, a doughy note, and a lingering bitter (but not astringent) nuttiness at the finish. That being said, I'm just left a little cold. Maybe I'll just stick with the pancakes when I'm in the mood for this kind of experience."

3.0,"This is a fantastically interesting tasting experience. For me, matches up rather precisely with the expert review - it's absolutely astonishing that when you roll it around your mouth, the middle of your tongue reads it as water. But the front of the palate picks up the pleasant baking spices and fruit, so that's all right. The short finish encourages that next taste and it always feels fresh. Overall quite enjoyable."

3.75,"Taste:  1.5 oz neat in glen cairn, then 2 drops spring water.

Nose. (4.0):  Cherry, grape and vanilla prevail with some nice butterscotch notes.  There is a bit of musty barnyard hay or barrel funk like you might get in a Wild Turkey, or a good rum.  I really like the nose here.  Reminds me alot of Wild Turkey Revival for 1/3 the price.

Taste (3.75):  Initially this is sweet going in.  Cherry and vanilla hit on the front with a bit of sweet cream corn.  There is a jam-like quality to this, but then it gets dry.  Then comes some baking spices that gives it a tartness.  That drying I spoke of gets a little bit more intense as this plays through.  Dry red wine lovers will dig it.

Finish (3.5):  For the proof this has a medium finish.  I get the tannic oak, vanilla, and a bit of anise or black licorice trailing off with some smokiness.

Overall:  This is a very good whiskey given a 39.00 price tag.  It is interestingly sweet yet still plays within the bounds of quality spirit and not a cheap bourbon masked by a good sherry.  Reminds me so much of Wild Turkey Revival.  I put them side by side blind and it was hard for me to discern except the Rieger's dries out quicker and is not as coating.  I would definately recommend a bottle.  This is one that you bring to a group tasting, don't discuss the blending or lack of provenance (Distilled in Indiana, bottled in Missouri, so I am guessing blended MGPS), and then the group will say, ""huh?  Where did you get that?  It is really good.

**Side Note:  My sampling was 2017 Collector's Addition.  Don't think that changes anything but the label BUT I want to be sure so not to confuse***"

3.5,"brown sugar and corn sweet, easy to sip.  The corn, malt, rye, sherry are all present, but corn wins.  short finish.

a desert whiskey,  not a campfire whiskey, unless you eat your cake around a campfire,  then a campfire whiskey."

3.75,"I actually really like this one, but disagree with the critical review... it think this one is buttery smooth and don't really get the spice.  For a limited distribution type of booze, this one is top notch.  Would easily put it upagainstagainst the lighter profile big boys (wheat mashes)."

4.0,"[Tasted on March 20, 2018 at the Moonrise Hotel in St. Louis]

Strong vanilla note on the nose.  Whiskey is very sweet, with strong sherry flavors.  Rye spiciness comes through on the finish."
4.0,"Nose: The nose is sweet and fruity with grapes and prunes, probably from the oloroso wine that's been added. It's very unique, in a great way, much like the city in which she's made and after which she's named.

Taste: It is a strong and bold taste that is sweet and fruity matching the nose, yet has the oaky notes that I love in a whiskey.

Opinion: it's a beautiful whiskey. J. Rieger & Co. are doing great things at their distillery and their innovation and  creativity are to be admired! I would buy it again and try anything else they make. Cheers!"

3.5,"Sherry aroma evident from the first whiff.  Vanilla-filled caramel flavor with a sip.  Strangely thin when it first hit the tongue, but then thickens and rounds out with a cherry finish.  Still, a tad sharp, not with rye - but almost medicinal."

3.0,I was a bit disappointed with this. Not really sure why but sometimes a reason is not needed. For the $17.99 it cost I felt it was worth a shot. I will keep it around but it is not spectacular.
