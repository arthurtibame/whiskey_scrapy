4.5,Really balanced barrel proof. Great to sip with one cube
4.25,Found this to be very good. The flavor reminds me of cinnamon rolls. The proof doesn’t hit you in the face like others. Really enjoyed it

4.75,"The nose is big time vanilla with some toasted brown sugar. On the palate is vanilla, cinnamon/baking spice, cherry, oak... thick and oily, with a long finish"
3.75,smooth with a silky after taste
4.25,"Some spice, brown sugar and grain. Has some mild heat. Deep and rich. More so than RR."
4.5,Very strong and flavorful drink.  So powerful.
4.5,"The nose is robust but not overpowered by alcohol. I get notes of Nesquik chocolate powder, Reddi-wip, and honey. I think that the taste is best described as chocolate-milk-with-an-attitude. The medium-long finish features a touch of nuttiness followed by strong oakiness which gives-way to an air of fresh tobacco."

4.75,The smoothest 116 proof bourbon I've ever had. Goes down like a 90 proof. Great bargain bourbon that I think is highly underrated.

4.0,"Had to back the nose out of this one a little bit... Really packs a wallop.  Notes of musty corn, rye grain, toast and light wood, some caramel and vanilla.  
Hot on the palate, long on the finish. 
Front shows rye grains and oak
Seamless transition from sweet to dry and back carries the caramel, barrel notes and grains into a finish that unfolds over an astonishingly long time.  Notes of chocolate and eucalyptus emerge among the caramel and char.
This is special.  Well balanced and my favorite product of the Russels."

4.75,"4.75. One of my favorites. Love the punch of this, but pretty easy to drink, despite the high proof. Hint of mint, some vanilla. Just really nice."
5.0,"Amazing, I truly love this Bourbon. It has become my regular dram.
Perfect balance to enjoy Neat."

4.75,"To this day I've never had a standard Wild Turkey (standard or 101) and I hate to say it, but I don't know why I would after having this.  It's affordable, delicious, and everything you could ask for in a bourbon.  You can tell it's a high rye bourbon, but the rye is smooth and not punchy.  For something that's 58% ABV, it's reasonably easy to drink.  It still packs a punch, but it's pretty silky and buttery.  It has this lovely banana note on the nose that turns into banana bread on the palate with those spices from the rye.  That coupled with the toasted wood and deep vanilla, it's easy to keep pouring more."

4.25,"Surprisingly sweet given the alcohol content.  Very smooth with minimal alcohol burn.  Nose is spice, and a bit of pepper.  I taste notes of baseball leather, vanilla, and corduroy pants."
2.25,"Oak, vanilla, and pepper immediately on the nose with a slight hint of banana nut bread.  Spicy and peppery on the front end of the palate.  Oak and light smoky flavor mid-palate.  Long peppery finish trailing off to a vanilla.  I would not recommend for the newbie bourbon drinker due to the immediate peppery taste from the high proof.  I prefer this spirit on the rocks to mellow out the upfront pepper."

3.75,"Vanilla, mint, brown sugar and confectioners sugar. The first sip was sweet and smooth, then was next sip is a perfect spice bomb. This alternate with each sip too!

This reminds me of the Russell’s SiB a tad bit (both Wild Turkey products of course), and that is one of my go-to drinks."
4.5,Huge mint and vanilla vibes. It comes in a little hot on the tongue and immediately cools into a vanilla/ confectioners sugar sort of sweetness. Lingers with mint and toasted sugars. Incredible bourbon.

4.0,"Oak, toasted peanuts"
4.5,"After you get acclimated to the burn, this bourbon really is flavorful. The nose tells you nothing, no heavy alcohol proof, no heads up on the flavor, the nose is very generic to a typical bourbon. However the taste is really nice, baking spice, cherry, and that burnt wood. For a price that's around the mid $40 dollar range, the value of this whiskey is well worth what you'd pay for a $60 bottle. Great value, great taste, and definitely worth the bottle purchase. The high proof will put off a lot of new whiskey drinkers, so if you've just started your whiskey journey, I wouldn't recommend this bottle. Otherwise all others, just get a bottle if this, you won't be disappointed!"
