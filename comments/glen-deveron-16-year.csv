3.75,"My friend recently bought a bottle of this for me while he was traveling abroad. I was really expecting a lot from this whisky given it’s age. While it’s not terrible, it’s just too soft and mediocre. It has a thin mouthfeel, and it’s too cereal/grainy on the palate which is  followed by a very quick finish. 

Being an easy drinking and inoffensive whisky is not what a 16 year scotch should  offer. Yes, scotch newbies will find it fairly smooth, but most newbies don’t go for 16 year expressions. Experienced whisky drinkers will find it dull and lifeless. I gave this a score of 3 stars and won’t be looking to get another bottle.

UPDATE: 06/08/2020
I may have been a little hasty with my review of this scotch. Having spent a bit of time with this and the bottle now approaching 2/3rds, I’m finding the neck pour wasn’t very representative of what this whisky has to offer.  The palate now offers a nice blend of soft fruits and caramel that finishes with a hint of malt, sweet toffee and ripe strawberries/cherries. The finish is still a little short for what I would expect from a 16 year scotch , but  overall it’s starting to grow on me, and therefore I have adjusted my score accordingly. I also tried adding some water, but I don’t recommend that as it weakens an already thin mouthfeel and doesn’t improve the experience."

4.25,"Nose: Rich with notes of plums and raisins, cherries, and leather.  

Palate: Lots of honey initially. Fruity with some vanilla on the palate as well. Quite smooth and full flavoured. 

Finish: Medium finish with the sherry cask showing itself. The peat is not coming through for me, nor does it seem to be mentioned on the bottle. I quite enjoyed this whisky despite the expert and others' reviews."

2.0,"Nooooo, no, no, no... This is not good. It's not gasoline, but that's not reason to want to drink this. The nose is underwhelming with notes of honeycomb and heather, reminding me of an Aberfeldy (and I'm no fan of that distillery). The palate has faint smoke with an element of cooked fat (like bacon stripped of its meat). The finish takes a nosedive from an already mediocre whisky, and is short and sweet."
