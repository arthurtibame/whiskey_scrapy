3.5,"This is a very interesting rye. Dark fruits and roasted nuts along with mint and other herbal and floral notes. Palate is very smooth and taste confirms the nose. Round and medium finish. Definitely understand why some say it tastes like Christmas...

I can see why this is a great rye, I'm just not a huge fan of rye. I'm giving it a 3.5 given it's complexity.

I use the rating scale below. Distiller uses a scale of 5 and I use a scale of 10, but I’m sure you’re not too drunk to do the math!

1. Disgusting - So bad I poured it out.
2. Poor - I wouldn't consume by choice.
3. Bad - Multiple flaws.
4. Below average - Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.
5. Good - Just average.
6. Very Good - Better than average.
7. Great - Well above average.
8. Excellent - In a league of its own.
9. Incredible - An all-time favorite.
10. Perfect"

4.25,"Deep copper appearance. Vanilla, slight caramel and black pepper on the nose. Flavor tastes like the nose. Medium-thick mouthfeel. Medium finish.
Not a big rye guy but this is delicious and smooth. There is a touch of that signature rye heat on the way down but just the right amount."

4.0,"Started neat, then added ice.
Nose: Starts astringent but then reveals stone fruit reminiscent of apricot and nectarine. 
Palate: Initially get the heat from spice notes with hints of orange peel. Then waves of grassy herbs come and go from sage to cilantro. Not as floral as the Act 5 but still complex and exciting.
Finish: Long lasting finish without overwhelming heat.
-Ice clarifies the harmony of flavors and helps separate the profiles."
1.75,"I've never been a MWND fanboy, but I've bought and enjoyed them since Act 1. Act 7 is not good. Green, unpleasant pickles. Thick, sticky artificial sugar. Where's the port??"
4.5,"PSA: this isn’t a tasting note, but a message in a bottle to anyone who will read this... I need another bottle of this. It is wonderful, and I’ve only found it one time. Wonderful."
