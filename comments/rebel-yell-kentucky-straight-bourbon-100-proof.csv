3.25,"50ml airplane bottle neat in a Glencairn at home.  I have low expectations, given my experiences with cheap Rebel Yell in high school some 27 years ago.  Nose has some alcohol heat, some astringency, vanilla, lite wood.  Flavor has oak, honey, cloves, some odd herbal/grassy notes.  Heat lingers, along with some burnt tobacco and herbs.  Lacks the smoothness of a good wheater.  Not bad, but not particularly good either. 5/25/19."

4.0,"I remember thinking that the Original Rebel Yell had some potential, but was way under proofed. More of a ""Rebel Whisper"" if you will. After hearing about the release of the 100 proof edition I vowed to pick it up when I saw it. Let's see if the extra 20 proof points change this one to a true Rebel Yell.
NOSE: Immediately notice the darker orangish hue that this one has over its 80 proof sibling. The nose is slightly hot with Cinnamon, Cherry, Straw, and Oak. There was a floral note for a bit, but it dissipated quickly. Despite the big alcohol note, the nose is good.
NEAT: Enters sweet with Burnt Sugar, Butterscotch, Vanilla, Cherry, Cinnamon and a surprisingly healthy dose of Oak. Lightly Astringent and Slightly Hot on the medium length finish, but not out of line for a 100 proof pour. Unlike the 80 proof version, you know you just took a drink of bourbon. That surprising Oak (SO MUCH OAK) coats the palate and lingers along with a light sweetness and a touch of a grassiness. Very good.
SPLASH: A few drops of water oddly gives the nose a savory character. Think the smell you get when you walk in from work and The Woman to Whom You're Related by Marriage has a roast in the oven. Cuts down the astringency on the palate and brings the Cherry Cola note to the front. As I'm typing this review, I am enjoying a pour of this over a large chunk of ice and man is it good. 
VERDICT: I'll start my verdict with a direct quote from my review of Original RY...""I described Four Roses Yellow Label as ""light without being weak"". Unfortunately the Rebel Yell is both Light AND Weak. With a name like Rebel Yell you would expect some bite or burn. Some harshness and character. I really feel this one is WAAAAAY under proofed. I'd love to see it at 86-90""...I was right, as the added proof makes this one an Oak Bomb and puts some Oooomph in the finish. And Kudos to LuxCo for doing it for about 20 bucks. My two favorite new American Whiskies this year (this one and the OldFo Rye) are both around $20. To me, this bodes well for budget conscious buyers in the near future. This is a solid 3 3/4 Stars, but the fact that it drinks way above its $20 price tag gets it to a 4."
2.25,"Smells nice, fresh spring day. On the palate, sweet, smooth for the proof. Thicker than expected. Sweet but not too much. Pecan nibs at the end, lingers a bit. Lacks depth but a pleasant sipper. 7/4/19"
2.5,"Nose: caramel, apples, cherries. Surprisingly heavy oak. Almost a hint of black pepper or barrel char. Sour mash. Sweet vanilla cream.

Taste: cherry syrup , oak, vanilla candy. Light baking spices. 

Surprised how oaky and light this was especially for 50 abv. Pretty standard budget bourbon nothing amazing"
2.75,"Pretty standard bourbon profile. Spice and vanilla.

3.0,"Rebel Yell 100 is definitely a step up in the right direction.  The color is slightly darker than the regular version with some good oak flavor, vanilla, and some caramel.  The finish is medium to long and the flavors last.  You know this is a 100 proof whiskey.   I like it and will probably buy again.  The price is right at 20 bucks so it is a good value in my opinion."

3.5,"Stronger aroma and taste for a wheater and I like it. Finish is harsher though so that’s it’s downside. But, for the price it’s solid."
3.5,"BACKGROUND: Long considered among the bottom rung of the bottom shelf bourbons, Rebel Yell was originally created by the Stitzel-Weller Distillery in the early-1950s and marketed only in the southern United States.

A series of sales transferred production of the brand to Diageo and eventually to Luxco, which owns the trademark and distributes it nationally today.

The wheated bourbon is actually produced by Heaven Hill Distillery and sourced by Luxco.  Though the basic 80 proof Rebel Yell still resides with the bottom shelf bourbons, the 100 proof version has become something of a cult favorite among aficionados and is highly sought.

As an interesting side note, Rebel Yell was once the favorite drink of Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards.  Rocker Billy Idol came up with the idea for his song “Rebel Yell,” which reached number six on the U.S. record charts in 1985, after watching Richards and fellow band member Ron Wood chugging from a bottle of the bargain bourbon backstage.

NOSE: The Rebel Yell 100 smells like the inside of a corn crib with tobacco leaves nestled among the ears.  There is some cinnamon present within the abundant corn and tobacco, as well.  It is a strong nose for a wheated bourbon and packs quite a punch.

PALATE: The palate provides wave after wave of cherry, plum, and plenty of pepper.  The Rebel Yell 100 drinks hotter than its proof, but certainly not in an unpleasant way.

FINISH: The long finish just keeps going and going.  The fruit and pepper on the palate morph into chocolate and leather on the finish.  The finish offers altogether pleasing flavors and sensation.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: The Rebel Yell 100 punches far above its price class, and it is one of the best sub-$20 bottles that you will find anywhere.  

Let’s hope positive word-of-mouth doesn’t prompt Luxco to follow the Heaven Hill Bottled-in-Bond lead and jack up the price while lowering the quality.

If you saved your Confederate money from the War Between the States, use all of it to stock up on Rebel Yell 100.

Like the 100 proof, the Rebel Yell 10-Year Single Barrel has received positive reviews, but I have not yet been able to locate a bottle.  After enjoying the Rebel Yell 100 so much, I will be redoubling my search efforts for a bottle of the 10-year."
3.5,"Nose... Bananas, nuts, leather, and brown sugar....

Appearance...Dark amber to light copper...

Taste... Buttery, smooth, creamy and salty. Followed by a slight hint of ethanol, then pears and oats...

Overall... For the proof it's undeniably smooth and easy drinking. I always drink neat and this was very much like dessert in a glass. It's gentle wheat helps make this whisky a nice opener to those getting introduced into the wheaters...."

3.0,"3 stars for value! Can't find ""that Wellerz"" buy this.  Worth more than the $17.0 I paid!"
2.0,"The smell is weak of flavor, but the proof is still there. The taste is great on the lips, but once it gets past the teeth into the rest of the mouth, all flavor vanishes. This is a perfect example of how wheated bourbons can fall very flat if not given another attribute, such as age, proof, filtering, etc. The taste is slightly different, but this is just as watery as Maker's Mark, but I can't say I expected much for the price. A redeeming factor is that, although the taste is weak, the proof does come back around on the finish and at least gives this a partial leg to stand on."
3.25,"In the last week I tasted both the standard Rebel Yell and Larceny wheated bourbons. I think that Weller Reserve is over rated, but the one thing it has over the other two wheated bourbons is that it is not overly sweet. The Larceny and Rebel Yell have a heavier syrupy texture and taste that I am not a big fan of."

3.5,"Nose - caramel, vanilla, peanuts, cherries, buttery cinnamon, moderate ethanol burn. 

Taste - brown sugar, caramel, vanilla, mild chocolate, cinnamon, finishing fairly quickly with a classic bourbon (if not slightly rough) finish.

I think this is a really solid bourbon for the price. Would be interested in comparing this side-by-side to WT101."
2.5,"Not flat, but kind of one note."
4.0,"The nose starts off with sweet pipe tobacco but is quickly followed by honey, vanilla and hints of pepper and oak. The palate is somewhat oily and chewy with pepper and cinnamon, while vanilla, caramel and touches of butter and oak come following. The finish is medium peppery, with cinnamon that lingers as vanilla and caramel fade."

3.75,"I like wheaters and this one fits the bill.  The nose is very alcohol forward.  Very strong alcohol.  After a bit, some of the alcohol dissipates.  A bit of apple cuts through along with browned butter.  The flavors are of what you would expect from wheated bourbon.  The alcohol is not noticeable in the flavor profile.  I get a lot of butter and apple.  Almost like apple pie without spices added.  The mouth feel is thick and smooth.  The same with the finish.  It's warm and lingers nicely.  After a splash of water, the butter flavors warm up even more, but some unexpected heat arrives.???  It really is a nice pour.  I am afraid I have to rate it on flavor between Maker's and Maker's 46.   However, at $19.99 and 100 proof, it has to be closer to 46 for the money. I really can't find much fault with it."

3.5,"For around $20, RY100 is 4.5 to 5 stars....a superb value. When compared to other mid-shelf Bourbons, 3 - 3.5 stars seems about right. This is a nice sip with no off or weak flavors as one might expect at this price point. But Buyer beware, this Bourbon could be renamed Oak Mountain. Oak is dominant throughout the taste.....front to back it’s Oak, Oak, Oak. Fortunately, it’s a nice oak wallop with some classic Bourbon flavors coming in nicely on the mid-palate and finish. This is not a sweet Bourbon by any stretch, much more a dry and tannic profile done right. Overall, I like this pour, and I friggin’ love it at this bargain basement price. If you have a Bottle of some overly sweet Bourbon taking up space on your bar, try mixing some of it with RY100. No sin here at 20 bucks!"

4.25,"On the nose, there is a lot of cinnamon, vanilla, roasted peanut, cherry, sweet corn and a wheat breadiness with lighter notes of oak, lemon zest, brown sugar, and a floral note. On the taste, the breadiness note comes off as cornbread with a cinnamon sugar spread. Through all of this, it is really hard to ignore the roasted peanut note, which is accompanied by a lighter barrel char note on the finish. It is really fun to find such a fun bourbon at such a low price point. This is one of the best values in bourbon, as long as you enjoy a strong nuttiness in your bourbon."

4.0,"Light and smooth as you’d expect from a wheated bourbon, but has a slightly darker profile than some... more brown sugar sweet than artificial sweeteners, hint of nutty flavors and a nice cinnamon spiciness. Some fruit on the nose and subtly on the palate. Good tingle to the burn that lasts long enough . Very pleasant, especially at the price.

Final number: 88"
3.5,"Vanilla, hot"
3.5,Bonus points for the value price. Not many 100 proof wheaters out their. It is good enough to drink neat. Fantastic  in a cocktail. Good daily drinker.
3.75,"Nose: sweet corn, vanilla, hints of cherry

Palate: richer than the 80 proof but spicier than expected as the lower proof Rebel Yell was always pretty smooth if one dimensional. 

Finish: short to medium 

The nutty nose on this especially betrays what I imagine is Heaven Hill sourcing. I’d say this is a few points better than the 80 proof and since the price point is pretty similar I’d go for this one over the 80."
