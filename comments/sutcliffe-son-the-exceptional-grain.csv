3.75,"Very interesting scotch, light and sweet, but more like a bourbon than a Speyside. 
Nose - honey, vanilla and caramel, with some musty notes that are typical in scotch
Taste - light sweet honey, some dark fruit and a bit of orange zest
Finish - silky and sweet, fades fairly quickly"

3.25,"Spicy nose reminds me a bit of Dalmore, but taste is like a honey infused highland Park 12. Not bad, but not exceptional"
