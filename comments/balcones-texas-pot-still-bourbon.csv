2.5,Tastes and nose seem younger than 24 months.
2.75,"Even to my mostly broken sniffer, the nose is all butterscotch.  A very smooth and creamy entry, butterscotch and caramel through mid-palate, and a very short, dry finish, with a little ""wet wood"" taste on the end.  I find it quite easy to sip, but rather boring.  My wife appreciates the creamy mouth full of butterscotch with no bite on the end."

4.0,"Just tried it, pretty good. Would recommend for a casual afternoon drink."
2.5,I’m just not getting this one. Just nothing that stands out. Like a well bottle.
2.5,"Needs more time to age. 

All balcones have this earthiness to them that I just can’t escape. I was hoping the bourbon wouldn’t have it but it does. Also, needs a bit more than 24 month of aging. 

It was ok probably won’t buy it again."

2.25,Quite creamy with some floral notes at the end with a crisp finish a bit tame for my taste
3.5,A bit more burn that other Balcones.  Lots of oak and homey with a Smokey finish. Nice!

4.0,"Creme Brûlée, vanilla and caramel."
5.0,"Brown sugar and baking spice nose. Leathery. Palate is rich and viscous like a highland scotch. Stewed apricots on the palate... cherry jam, butterscotch. Cacao nibs and sea salt in the finish."
2.75,"Second taste notes: Creamy honey and corn syrup, drizzled with maple.
Sweetness is reminiscent of the Baby Blue, but more of a honey sweetness rather than a corn syrup sweetness. Does have a nice oily texture, velvety, but doesn’t linger super long. I would drink the heck out of it, and it’s the most affordable of Balcone’s bunch."

3.25,Not overly impressed. Harsh with no dynamic taste. I imagine this makes a better cocktail than it does drinking neat.

2.75,"this spirit is overall a little thin. Maybe it needs a little more proof, or a little more time in the barrel. I get a fair bit of barrel smoke and wood spice, just just a tad bit of corn and caramel. Very dry, and not sweet at all. Minimal finish."

3.0,"Really interesting. The nose is intense and is probably my least favorite part of the drink...it's just intense oak and fake cinnamon, almost like Big Red gum. Some dusty corn.

You get both of those elements on the taste, but it opens up to some more enjoyable aspects: vanilla, chocolate  and yeasty. 

Gives you a good burn to say goodbye. 

I don't love it, but it's distinct and it's solid quality. Definitely worth trying if you're out at a bar, but I'm not looking to buy a bottle."

3.25,"Nose: Waxy peanuts.  Dusty corn.  Vanilla, burned caramel.  European-style cultured butter.  Flight floral hit.  Solid hit of char.

Palate: Dusty corn with waxy peanuts.  Burned caramel and barrel char.  Hint of vanilla.  Tartness.  Presents at a higher proof than it is.  Tongue-numbing prickly quality.

Other notes: I really wanted to like this stuff.  Everything I read and heard suggested that I'd love this one and as I slowly worth through this bottle, I just... don't.  I can see why some people love it, but it just comes up short for me.  This rating (like most of my others) is based more on an objective assessment and less on my personal preferences."

3.75,"“Made from a 4 grain mash bill of roasted blue corn, Texas wheat, Texas rye, and malted barley. Aged for 1 year in new charred barrels. Nose: vanilla and toasted grain. Palate: raw corn and light caramel. Finish: char smoke and butter chocolate.”"

3.25,Honey throughout. Great mouth feel.. oily. Overall not incredibly complex. Very long and hot finish with smoke / char
4.0,"Nose: Honey-glazed ham. Very dense, dark, and deep. Ripe fruit (plums, raisins, dark cherries). Classic caramel and vanilla with oak but not in the spotlight.

Taste: Deep, dark molasses sweetness that turns to bitter coffee/cocoa, then finishes with dry oak. Tannins. Almost numbing the tongue.  Smooth finish, but dry."

3.75,"Disclaimer.....I’m a Texan and this is our local stuff. I’ve tried a bunch of local bourbon and have not liked much of it. Just trying to be transparent but I’m definitely rooting for Texas bourbon to break out. Ok so here goes. TLDR....it’s weird but I like it.

White sugar, orange, oak, and leather on the nose with heavy alcohol up front. It’s unique and interesting but smells young. It hits sweet up from on the palate but only like sugar not vanilla as in most bourbons. The oak and leather show up in the finish which is surprisingly long. This is definitely a new territory of bourbon but I like it. It somehow reminds me of scotch. There’s much to be improved on but I like where it’s going.

At $28 I’ll keep buying this stuff."

4.5,My favorite pot still bourbon.
3.75,"Burnt caramel, vanilla, brown sugar, maple, and sweet corn on the nose,  the buttery palate is not nearly as sweet as the nose, there's some muted corn, caramel and vanilla, the medium length finish has a buttered toffe popcorn note."

3.0,"Sweet, caramel and vanilla forward with a hint of apple fruit. Almost syrupy (corn syrup) when coming from other bourbons. Soft on the spice side."
3.75,"Caramel smooth, leathery and buttery on the nose. Bright whiskey with hints of oak and caramel. High percentage corn mash for the taste and feel."
4.0,Soft easy drinking beginning. Nice smooth finish. Notes of vanilla. My first Texas Bourbon. Slight tang but I like it.

4.0,"Nose: Walnuts, dusty corn, cherries, vanilla.  Toffee, toasted honeyed cereal grains, bananas.  Musty pot still funk - that creamy thing you get from Midleton, Redbreast comes to mind.  Bright and shiny almost acetone note.  Wet cardboard.  Yeasty cinnamon rolls.  Orange blossom and honeysuckle.  Green veggies - bell pepper, cucumber, and celery.

Palate: Cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, cumin.  Tongue-drying tannic character flowing into that acetone note again.  Oaked musty walnuts, cashews, and pecans.  Waxy.  Floral perfume.  Very bright, not much low palate.  Mid palate is fairly subdued and straightforward.  Everything on show here is upper register.  Cream cheese frosting with a bit too much confectioner's sugar and an almost lactic tang.  Paper.  Finish starts off with musty, lactic, funky tang.  Then a bright pop from the ethanol - that metallic, acetone note shows up.  Oak, char, and barrel bitter poke their head through.  As the ethanol burn dies down, banana Nilla wafers take over as things coast into a simple brown sugar and vanilla tail, with notes of dill, dried basil, and celery blossoming here and there.  Finish is relatively long.

Other notes: My first taste of this really challenged me.  My nose and palate had a really hard time dissecting this in any meaningful way.  Coming back to it now, I'm finding some more complexity and am better able to identify what's going on.  The overall character is still largely the same to me, but I have better appreciation for what's going on in the glass.  Though I'm still not likely to put this on my short list to buy again, I'm glad I gave it another shot.  I wish the palate was a little more rounded out, but I can understand what they're trying to demonstrate here."
3.0,"Not bad, probably won't buy again.  A little hot, short finish."

3.75,"Actually surprisingly good! Almost get a sweet like almond candy or a walnut nutty type of candy vibe on the palate !
The nose I kind of a honey and grass /earthy mixture that reeks of a pot still !
Honestly I was probably more harsh on Balcones at first when I started getting into whiskeys and bourbons but a few of their lines have changed my mind!
Such a rapid difference between most distillery’s and at this point idk if they can be considered just a crappy craft distillery....
I’ve had a few store picks and all have been sublime!
From the DFWWC pic to just the plain pot still .
This distillery is slept on but won’t continue to be!
I’ll happily buy pot still for $30 with no regrets for that change of pace 
But you’re either gonna love their stuff or hate it 86/100"

3.0,"Young corn on the nose, but you can tell there is going to be a difference with the blue corn. That corn scent comes in the form of buttered, honey cornbread. Hell, it's even easy to smell some buttery caramel sauce in there, too. Impressive for such a young bourbon, but if you start with good grains, this should be no surprise.

The grains is what rules this taste. There is very little barrel flavor (although it is there), with the vanilla and caramel being what comes through, and none of the char or smoke. As I thought, I can tell this Texas blue corn is much sweeter than Midwest corn, which is likely how this super young product can be enjoyed by those who are looking for that sweet bourbon flavor. The finish on this starts to bring about some berries and a fruitiness, with maybe a tiny wisp of smoke.

This reminds me of those cheap, iconic extremely sweet bourbons that everyone claims to ride or die with. I've found that all of those bourbons are very unrefined, and just taste like corn juice with alcohol tied to it. This, however, tastes like a product that the distillery actually is proud of and aimed to make, and for that, I appreciate the final offering. I'm not sure where I would use this, because unless it's a very fruity or citrus heavy cocktail, I don't see this working, and it's certainly too young to poor alongside flagship bourbons that are aged much longer."

3.0,"They claim it is aged at least two years. Yeah I know that's not much but this is produced from pot stills, non chill filtered and no coloring added. This should lead to a nice oily whiskey which I like. Ive also read many positive reviews and hell it was only $28 at Twins. Poured neat, dark amber color belying its age. Nose has bowling alley, corn muffin, dried cherry and soft wood. Some dusty maple spice sneaks in too. Its got a youthful edge but with good depth. Kinda noses like a wheater to me. Thick weighty mouthfeel from the pot still is very evident and a tactile enjoyment. Creamy velvety texture leads palate of dark cherries with some buttercream icing and baking spice. Has a nuttiness as well. An oily type nut like macadamia along with some salted raw pretzel dough. Not much barrel coming through due to lack of aging. Finishes with lingering sweet cherry, cinnamon and a somewhat scotch-like malt note along with toasted wood. Its hot for proof but it doesn't get in the way. For me, the cons of the youth are easily outweighed by the wonderful characteristics of the pot still flavor delivery. For under $30 this is an easy repurchase imo.........81/100........think of it as Texas Redbreast on the cheap.......This is a new release and not available everywhere yet (TX, CA,FL) but will become a core product. Texas residents I suggest you give it a go!"
3.75,"Ahhh, Balcones.  There's no mistaking it. If you're familiar with Balcones, this whiskey won't take you by surprise.   In fact, if you're familiar with Balcones, I suspect that if you were served this bourbon in a blind tasting you'd say ""this is Balcones"" before you'd even determined it was a bourbon.  On my palate, this bourbon has more in common with other Balcones whiskeys than it does with any bourbon I'm familiar with.

This pot still bourbon has the mocha/caramel note of Balcones Rye.  It has the bold roundness of the Single Malt, and some of the smoked corn found in the Brimstone.

Having said that, it's absolutely not a classic bourbon, nor does it have the complexity of some other four-grain bourbons.   But I find it quite enjoyable, if a bit simple and straightforward.  Notwithstanding the weak Distilller review and the mixed user reviews, I decided to try it for no other reason than it was 28 bucks.  The VFM is strong here. In fact, I'd be hard pressed to come up with more than a few whiskeys under $30 that I'd prefer to drink."
