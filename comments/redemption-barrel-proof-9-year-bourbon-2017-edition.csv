4.0,Very consistent flavor throughout the palate and finish. A very solid night's pour.
4.0,"Rye spice and sweet corn layered on a poignant oak aging, subtle smoky flavor. They get 100% for truth in advertising."

5.0,"Very good with notes of caramel, cherries, pepper, leather, gas at first but it later dissapates, a little chocolate, oak, and floral notes."
4.25,More sweet than spice. Some vanilla and fruit not overly oaked flavors. Nice with a large rock. Without the rock it’s warm with cinnamon finish.
