2.0,"Average to below average bourbon.  Some floral notes on the nose.  There is some vanilla, butterscotch and charred oak in the taste.   A couple drops of water opens this up.  Body is on thinner side.  Finish is medium with more observance of alcohol than flavor.  Should be priced in the $20 range; not worth more than that."

2.0,"Typical bourbon nose. Soft, super soft palate."
1.0,"Waste of money for the price. Website has no valuable information, you’re mostly paying for the bottle.
Nose: dry, not much there. Vanilla and barrel wood if you dig deep enough for it.
Palate: a little bit better, vanilla and caramel finally open up along with a black pepper feel.
Finish: good, not too short or long. Leaves that dry peppery taste that tells me there’s lots of rye. 
Overall: not worth the money. Don’t purchase"

4.0,"Very light and simple aroma. Initial taste is not impressive and flat. Adding few drops of water makes this drink almost too light and airy. Aftertaste is the far better than the smell or the flavor with smooth butterscotch notes. The smooth aftertaste really lingers but in a pleasant manner. The finish is light and clean. Would recommend using a splash of patience when sampling this bourbon. Was not impressed by first few sips but really improved over time. The bourbon opens up after 10 minutes. Onced aired, very easy and lightly floral bourbon to drink. I can see myself finishing half of the bottle while enjoying a mild cigar. Initial profile 79/100. Overall score 94/100."

3.0,Similar taste to Jack Daniels but costs twice as much!  I bought this at total wines who had it advertised as a 94 rating by some beverage trade group I never heard of.   A bit harsh with overly burnt flavors.  I like my bourbon on the smoother side.  I will have to save this for a batch of whisky sour!

3.0,I received this as a gift.  After seeing the price I would never pay that much for this.  I would give around 3.3.  Just missing something that I enjoy in a good bourbon.

3.0,"Nose - Sweet oaky vanilla, hint of cinnamon & cloves, dark caramel sweetness.

Taste - Lightly oaky, vanilla coke, caramel/toffee sweet, light cinnamon bitter.

Finish - Lingering vanilla/caramel coke sweet, lightly creamy, light cinnamon spice heat, faint sweet oaky bitterness.

Score - 80/100

Final Thoughts - This is a very light an inoffensive bourbon from start to finish. It's a great ""generic"" bourbon from start to finish with a slightly more oaky presence throughout. Classic notes on the nose, typical on the palate with a hint more caramel sweet and oaky bitter, but overall very sippable. Best neat or used in cocktail where a lighter bourbon is needed like a Paper Plane. Would be great to use as an intro bourbon for people new to bourbon, maybe with a tiny bit of water to soften it up even more or a single ice cube.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No, I most likely won't get another bottle."

3.5,Solid and a cool bottle but not worth $50. There are better values to be had.

3.0,Not my favorite. A little bit of a medine-like taste.
2.0,"Appearance: The color I saw in this curious little bourbon was auburn or a polished mahogany. The legs were thin and slightly viscous.

Nose: The nose unfortunately didn't impress me all that much; typical notes of heavy oak, caramel, and faint vanilla were there with other notes like new leather chair and grapefruit rind hiding in there too.

Taste: The palate seemed to me too watery and thin. Like I could tell it was bourbon but didn't get much from it. I found notes of cherry licorice candy, oak, and maybe brown sugar, but I don't know if that last one was just projected into my mind from their site’s notes.

Finish: The finish was short, it fades then a rising bitterness hits the back of your throat. I'm not sure what that's about.

Thoughts: I'm surprised by this bourbon actually. Calumet seems to have everything going for them: a great backstory, a great website, great land and a great vision, they unfortunately just don't have great bourbon. Now, they have a couple other whiskies in their portfolio, at least one of those is probably really good, but this one was just not hitting the bar. (Ha ha) Now, if this was a higher proof, that may make it more interesting and flavorful; I'd pay to see that done! Calumet, sorry guys. This one wasn't my thing, maybe next time! Cheers!"
