Perhaps I'm dying. 
Perhaps this is the end for me."

3.75,"Hmm again an example of older not necessarily better. I prefer the NAS Murray irrespective of price. And the 20 year.  I just find a number of these drams once they get over the 18 to 21 year mark they get over wooded and slightly bitter even after leaving to breathe for a long time. The 20 year mark was the good place to stop. Heavy toffee, slight bit of spice woodness not to bad and fades a bit the more you get into it. $200 USD is good value these days for a 25 year. By the end I was coming round to the dram a bit more."

No scores for anything sampled as I don’t think it would be fair.

PX sherry, fruity, sweet, soft and elegant oak. Nice but came across as a bit younger than 25. 

The palate was peppery oak, sweet and spicy, not what I was expecting from a 25 year old. 

Quite good and recommended."
null,"** Disclaimer:  This review is what I would consider a “Quick Hit”- meaning I won’t have my usual in-depth notes that I usually like to take.  The reason:  this sample was poured at Whiskyfest DC on 4/17/18.  All of these reviews will not be scored and I am actively looking to try them again at some point to do them more justice.

I was looking to take full advantage of the VIP hour to try as many older, age statement whiskies as possible.  This one was no exception.  Some of the various Tullibardine cask finished whiskies are very good.  This 25 had a nice flavor to it, but there seemed to be a shortage of depth and complexity here.  It’s a tasty dram, I was just hoping for more- especially at the $230 price point.  Hopefully I’ll get to try this one sometime in the near future."
