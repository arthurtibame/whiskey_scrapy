3.5,"Thin oily legs after a swirl and a dark gold honey color visually draw one in to this whiskey.

The nose is fruity and nutty with notes of salted walnuts, honey, black grapes, red apple, vanilla, and milk chocolate.

The palate comes off sweet and fruity. Apple, cherry, kiwi, plum, pear, straw stalk in your mouth, and aromatic pipe tobacco notes all play throughout your mouth.

The finish is long and dry, slightly altering the overall direction of the  journey.

Telluride Distilling, Thanks so much! Cheers!"
