4.5,"Nose - (w/o water) Spicy ginger, hint of ozone, ripe pears, rich honey, golden raisins, citrus zest, light longan (w/ water) More ozone, less spice, more ripe pears, mix of lemon/orange zest, golden raisins

Taste - (w/o water) Rich oily mouthfeel, golden raisins/ripe bosc pears, floral honey, white pepper tingle, light citrusy ginger, light salt (w/ water) Less heat, more lemon zest, floral honey, ripe pears, light salt, golden raisins.

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering ""fresh"" sweetness, darker golden raisin sweet, super ripe bosc pears, dark honey, ginger tingle, salt (w/ water) Lingering ripe pears, light tingle, honey, light citrus

Score - 94/100

Final Thoughts - This was a great dram overall. Nothing off-putting from start to finish. Very unique ""ozone"" in this one as well, but with a very ""fresh"" twist to it. This screams super ripe pears and golden raisin sweet, nice fruity floral aspect to it as well. Not sure if there was any sherry influence to this, but it feels like a nice sautern or sweet moscato or riesling influence. Regardless it's quite nice overall and the ""ozone"" aspect to it is great.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - Yes

Would I buy a bottle? - Yes, if I could find a bottle for around $200 USD"
