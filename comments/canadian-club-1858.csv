1.0,"Given the cases of this stuff that Don Draper consumed over the course of the hit show Mad Men, you would have to conclude that it wasn't only people's fashion sense that was much better back then.  A weird and unpleasant plastic note dominates the nose and utterly smothers phantom caramel notes that you can pick out if you really work at it... but really, why would you want to work at it?  Stiffly synthetic vanilla assaults your palate and the bummer finish has a drying bitterness about it.  On the rocks, Canadian Club is magically transformed from poor whiskey into acrid water.  Strictly a mixer folks! Note: My rating is for drinking this neat or on the rocks.  Add another star if you're planning on mixing this with Ginger Ale."

I had it on the rocks. On nosing, I couldn't detect a whole lot except alcohol. On the palate, more of the same, to the point where I almost thought I was drinking sweetened vodka. After a while, a little caramel came through, almost making think I was drinking rum. This is not anything I would buy a bottle of, or drink on the rocks again, but I thought I'd try it. I'm sure it would mix well, as it didn't have anything offensive."

2.0,"Barreled transfer from November 2016


Regardless of the ""Premium Extra Aged"" label, this is the regular base level Canadian Club. 

This is a blended Canadian whisky with no age statement. It has a dark amber color that appears to be heavy with added colorant. It no doubt is chill filtered and comes in at the legal minimum 40% ABV. 

The nose is harsh and immature. There is an initial blast of fennel that fades to overly sweet. Pancake syrup, butterscotch, oaky vanilla, toffee and caramel. There is also some honey. The sweetness screams inevitable hangover. 

The palate is overly sweet as well. Heavy butterscotch and syrup. Not very complex at all. There is also a metallic taste that again tells its lack of maturity. 

The mouthfeel is slightly oily, not bad. 

The finish is medium length and very sweet with a mild spice. 

This is definitely a mixing whisky and not meant to be consumed neat. The value is one of its only great qualities. I bought a 200mL bottle for the whopping price of $3.48 before taxes. Can't really knock that. If you are looking for a cheap mixer, this will do the job nicely. 2.25
If you are a fan of Canadian Club I urge you to try Forty Creek. It's like a small batch, craft version of CC. Much better quality and still very affordable."

3.0,"I’ve tried this whisky on the rocks and used it as a mixer. You really can’t go wrong for the value here. The palate is sweet but I don’t find it overly sweet. Flavours of vanilla, some spice and a bit of charred oak will hit you subtly and then taper off quickly with a creamy finish. I find this to be a very inoffensive whisky and although it’s not very complex it is a great whisky to have around for an occasional drink."

2.5,"Rather than a ""good"" whiskey this is a ""good"" example of a standard Canadian whiskey that shouldn't be disparaged or lauded for being something it is not.  CC is both a standard and standby and for many of us an ""old"" standby at that, in that plenty of people drink it so its always around, and for some reason thats important. It's the ""Being There"" factor of knowing what you have and get with CC It just pulls it's weight as a lower priced ""drinker"" by being mixable with soda or water and a twist and being a completely unmemorable drink, and that's not always a bad thing either.  For those who have been disgusted by some really bad bourbons and whiskeys, the JR something er others and Lazy hillbilly Guy and what nots of really terrible whiskies, well, this is certianly NOT one of those.   It doesn't suck, it just isn't ever going to win an award unless its a contest for being ordinary.
    
    I've often wondered if perhaps Canadian corn is simply inferior to that of the states in sweetness and flavor values for fermentation, it could explain a lot about the ""Canadians"" in general,  but either way the ""corn"" factor in this one is just not enough to even be worth mentioning.  In fact it stands out as a ""Canadian"" whiskey in that it offers nothing special in really any category of flavor components, but also has nothing offensive to offer either.  In every way it seems an industry standard  for what passes as lower-mid shelf store product found anywhere that is just ""good enough"" for every day use but only in an ""ordinary"" sense of the term.  There are plenty worse examples of the genre when it comes to Canadians and certianly some better ones also,  standard CC just falls smack in the ""white label"" middle of plainess.  In a pinch if theres nothing better, then this will do as long as you keep expectations low.  Just remember to take Pamela Anderson with you to the ice fishing shack and you won't care how really ordinary this whiskey is, 'old standby"" will be ready to not interfere with Pam er um fishing.."

Throw in a cube or two and this is not bad at all. Once again, price is the key here... For $12 a fifth this is well worth it. I've certainly spent more on worse."

3.0,"Appearance: So the color I found in this prohibition superhero is burnished bronze. It’s legs on the inside of the glass are medium thin and oily.

Nose: After bringing it up for a whiff I found the sweet nose with notes of caramel, pancakes and syrup, basil, oak, orange rind, honey, and saw dust.

Taste: On the palate I found notes of salted almonds, vanilla latte, honey, and cantaloupe and honeydew melons. 

Finish: The finish was a bit sharp, but that faded quickly into a honeyed aftertaste.

Thoughts: This Canadian whisky is a top seller; if memory serves, only Crown Royal sells more whisky than Club. With its bottom shelf price tag I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised. In fact, I liked it better than the more expensive Crown. I had no problems drinking it neat, and wouldn't mind getting this again or trying one of Club’s other family members. Thank you friends, I'm happy to join the Club! Cheers!"

1.0,"Nose: Wet brown cardboard boxes. Plywood sawdust. Grass clippings. A tiny trace of vanilla and aniseed, some grainy ethanol and a whiff of fly spray. Very faint overall – there is virtually no nose.

Palate: Light, nondescript arrival with some miniscule brown sugar notes. There is no development. The texture is less dense than water.

Finish: Very short. There is no finish other than a mild soapy ethanol note, which leaves a trace sweetness in the mouth.

This is unbelievably thin, watery and gutless – it’s like drinking a dilute shot of vodka to which a few drops of whisky have been added. The only complimentary thing I can say is that it is so lacking in personality that it even lacks offensive notes, so on that basis I’m giving it 1 star.

It’s not the worst whiskey I’ve ever tasted – far from it – but it is without question the most anaemic. As a mixer all it adds is a vague suggestion of “brown spirit”.

I nosed this so many times looking for anything resembling whiskey I almost hyper- ventilated. All I get is some watered down diet ginger ale splashed with witch hazel. Oh and there is an off note too, kinda like cod liver oil. I debated even sipping it. Braved it out and got more ginger water/alcohol with some bitter oak. Finish is mercifully short, dry and bitter. I don't see how they can even call this whiskey its brown vodka. This was a 50ml for a buck........would rather lite the dollar on fire. Still have a Canadian Mist 50ml to try, that will have to be another night cant take any more. Overall I'd call it undrinkable and good luck mixing with it. 20/100 sorry if ive offended any canucks"

1.0,"I had a pretty good idea of what this was going to be before I bought it. I was inspired to make this purchase after watching Don Draper drink this stuff on Madmen. I figured that if he can habitually sip this for over a decade, I can get through a single bottle.

Nose: The big note is something like a Vanilla Coke or a Rootbeer float. Other than that it's dusty corn and a bit of rye spice and herb. Extremely grainy and young. Maybe a bit of orange peel. It's ever so slightly floral. Not too bad actually.

Palate: Sweetness coming in the form of corn notes, but not like a bourbon. It's really a one-note pony. It's all vanilla. Outside of that, there's a medicinal quality. Not like an Islay Scotch though. It's simply reminiscent of the aftertaste of some non-flavored syrupy medicine. Rough.

Finish: All rye spice. More vanilla, some herb, and a dash of pepper. Very boozy. Thankfully, it's over pretty quickly.

Whisky must have come a long way since the 50s. I'd expect better of a multi-millionaire like Don Draper because this is a downright uncomfortable experience. Even the Crown Royal Bourbon Mash was more tolerable and considerably more interesting.

I know I'm being harsh on something that is clearly intended to be used as a mixer. But hey. I've had much better experiences from the bottom shelf. This tasting was akin to ripping off a bandaid. I was dreading it after my first few tastes but am glad it's out of the way. It makes Johnnie Walker Red taste like a high-end blend. It was only $13, so I'm done complaining. Instead, I think I'll go brush my teeth with hydrogen peroxide and try to forget that any of this happened."

1.0,"During a recent stay at an all-inclusive hotel, I was met with a very limited choice of whisky options: the infamous Canadian Club, VAT69, and another blend I have never even heard of. Do I really want to review THIS bottle? Well, let's get on with it. On the nose… Hello? Anyone there? Indistinct corn sweetness, alcohol and some grassy notes - that's it. Maybe it's not as bad as I thought? I am proven wrong. Harsh and watery at the same time, this tastes like a sweetened, oak-flavored vodka. Thank God, the burning finish is short to nonexistent. Seriously, no.

bottled at 40%abv, this ""Premium extra"" whisky is rather good, specially on the nose. Tawny color, very appealing.

On the nose: Very sweet, with maple syrup, honey, vanilla, prunes and creme brulee notes. 

On the palate is sweet but also grassy, with pleasant oaky notes, oranges, with a sensation of toffee and tobacco at the same time, with a medium spicy finish. It is light bodied and after adding water the nose turns fully honeyed and the palate turns into lemon bitter notes and tobacco finish. Good average dram, very sweet."
