5.0,Exceptional. Had the pleasure of getting to try this on the way back from Hong Kong. Little to no peatyness. Time mellows the scotch yet it still explodes with subtle yet complex flavor that lingers after the drink is done. Found myself enjoying the flavor for some time after tasting. If all scotch tasted this good Scotland would rule the world.
