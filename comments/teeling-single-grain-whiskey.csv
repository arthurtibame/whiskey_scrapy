3.0,"Nose: For a brief moment, there is that watery, yet stingy scent of spirit, that grains tend to do. Fortunately it fades away quickly, leaving room for smooth and soft notes of wine, red grapes and vanilla. The sweetness is then mixed with spices, resembling a lot of rye whisky. Water brings out the sweet Cabernet more.

Taste: Like nose, for few seconds, there's that bad blended kind of watery taste, that evolves into nice buttery sweetness and at the end, spices (that resemble rye yet again). Berries, fruits and spices. Water improves the taste, with emphasis on the sweet side, bringing red wine on the palate.

Finish: Dry and medium length. Sour berries, that linger and spices, that run fast down your throat.

Balance: Pretty straight forward Irish whiskey, which gives brief warnings of everyday bad grain blend, but thankfully overtakes 'em with sweet and spicy character. There's that rye kinda feel, which probably makes me like it more than I should."

4.0,"Nice to see an Irish whiskeymaker doing things right--46% ABV, non-chill-filtered. Openness about the contents of the bottle.

This is young stuff, but the quality is there, and the cabernet barrel finish does it some big favours. Spicy youthfulness, but big flavours: rum raisin, banana, corn husk, apples, vanilla, watermelon, grapes. Quite juicy. Mint, honey, ginger, tobacco. A bit of custard. Good stuff."

4.0,One of the easiest drinking whiskeys I've had. Very good straight and it doesn't loose anything if you water it down. Nice.
4.0,"Negative intensity. Delicious and highly drinkable. Wonderful vanilla bean and light honey notes laced throughout. The California Cab casks add a touch of tart berries to the otherwise caramelly, creamy profile. Hint of pistachio. A really likeable whiskey impeccably crafted."

3.0,"This whiskey starts with a welcoming nose of toffee, graininess/cereal and hints of fruit. The palate is soft, revealing it's oak side, with the those same notes from the nose appearing on the palate. Finishes in the dry side leaving the mouth oaky. Overall, a decent Irish whiskey, but I found myself expecting more given I thoroughly enjoy their Small Batch brand. I will need to try again where there are less time constraints.

3.0,"This just doesn't do it for me. There is too much of a grain sharpness to it like a nasty vodka. The nose does soften out and release a bit of oak. On the palate it's the same story really. I much prefer the small batch, it is much more interesting and enjoyable to me."

4.0,"[4.3.2016] Another find by my in-laws, this one in the duty free shop on the way home. This steals the title for best Irish from an old friend, Jameson, despite rumors that it includes grain alcohol (who doesn't?) in its esteemed blend. 

On the nose this opens up to be fairy average, making the first taste ever more so surprising. Smoky malt warms the palate before the spice sinks in. It is obvious this whiskey has a strong and sweet corn base, with an oak and vanilla background reminiscent of many bourbons. Not only is this hot breakfast type of whiskey, but unless you pour it on some Quaker Oats, it would probably be an amazing pairing."

Definitely a worthwhile pour for the event. We both picked up the vodka-like nose that was mellowed with some added water allowing the buttery caramel notes to come through. The palate neat was spicy, more like a red zin than a Cabernet. Water brought out an oily mouth feel. The finish was peppery.  The empty glass was a very nice buttery oak. If the O's win I may just have another."

3.0,"I'm not a huge fan of this, definitely did not feel like a standard Irish whiskey, this is probably due to the high corn bill. I got some orange peel, brown sugar and nougat on the nose. It was a little bitter and did not feel very complex, a little young."

3.0,"Imported from UK in 2015 for about $50. Nose (Neat): Light alcohol, menthol, slight sunflower, some vanilla and sweet of caramel. Palate (Neat): Medium burn going down. Vanilla, slightly sweet, very spicy and some buttery floral notes. I prefer to have this one on ice to soften the burn. It is also good in any whiskey based mixed drink. However, I prefer the Teeling Small Batch to this. That is smoother and a little less expensive."

4.0,"Visual:  Light amber/gold color. Thin legs. They don’t persist for long.

Nose:  Out of the bottle and into the glass, the first impression was perfume – floral and light, with some alcohol. Upon approaching the glass closer, I caught more alcohol, and some floral/herbal notes not unlike gin. After some time to open up, these notes dissipate completely, and are replaced by vanilla and honey – almost like a baklava topped with whipped cream to which a light dusting of vanilla bean has been added. 

Palate: Comes across at first as very bourbonesque, with vanilla and spice (like a high rye mash, with some barrel spices thrown in), but develops on the mid-palate with much more cereal grain than a bourbon. Some peppermint and faint smokiness (not at all like peat; more in the realm of barrel char) also develops on the palate.

Finish:  The finish is fairly long and warm. The finish is dryer than the nose and initial palate, with some oaky tannins remaining for a while.

Empty glass:  Toffee and pecans.

I approached my late Irish whiskey excursion with some skepticism. There are certain Irish whiskeys that I’ve tried that just didn’t do much for me. I must say that my most recent samplings have started to change my impression. This whiskey was really good – I mean, not Lagavulin 16 good, but few are. I kept thinking “I could drink this.” As it is available locally, I just might. I also might consider giving it as a gift to somebody not super familiar with Irish whiskeys, as it is approachable and easy to sip. This whiskey deserves four stars."

3.0,"Lighter in color than I expected given that this was finished in cabernet barrels. Fruit forward, grainy on the nose. A bit of honey as well. On the tongue it's spicy immmediately, followed by sweetness. There are some hints of wine, if you really think about it. Woody notes at the end, with a surprisingly dry finish. Didn't get as much of the vanilla notes, and for those who are expecting a bourbon-like experience given the profile, you'll need to temper your expectations, but it stands on its own as a nice Irish whiskey. 5/12/17  
  Sticks to the side of the glass. Grain and honey on the nose, a hint of nutmeg. Velvety texture, some mellow spice up front, then a turn of vanilla ice cream; this has more vanilla than the first time I tried it. Finishes with some wood notes and a bit of cough medicine. It's still hard to get too much of any wine influence. 6/21/17"

I was unsure of what was coming on the palate, and for as quiet as the nose seemed, this is a bold affair for a single grain. Toasted bread, oatmeal, raspberry jam, buttery vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg. It's like the best kind of cold weather breakfast was condensed into whiskey. Really nicely done, and for less than $50 a bottle, it's a good value."

Approachable and very pleasant nose - strong, oily, with vanilla to the fore. Taste is on the sweet side, not very complex from start to finish, but very friendly.  My first tasting was after a curry but I had a Lagavulin 16 to cleanse the palate! 
    
On the second outing it was first drink poured and again it wasn't that complex, I felt. Nevertheless, pleasant and easy. Probably a 3.5 star rating is fair."

The nose comes in with a minty, almost ethanol sharpness that can be off putting, but it blends fairly nicely with a toffee/creme brûlée creamy sweetness. The palate really shows the range of this NAS spirit when given a few drops of water, where i found vanilla, apple, cocoa, maple, anise, and more spearmint. (I’d be shocked if there’s no rye in this mash bill). The finish is medium, warming and again, minty.

All in all, a whiskey worth a pour or two for those interested in exploring Irish or single grain whiskies. Unique for sure, but for me the lingering minty menthol was just too much to recommend buying a bottle."

5.0,I’ve found my pinnacle. The peak upon which I can look at all other Irish whiskies. Maybe that’s a bit dramatic but holy hell am I enjoying this. First Irish whiskey I’ve tried at 46% abv which is making a nice bit of difference. Not complex but such a gorgeous sipper with some good character from the Cabernet Sauvignon maturation. I definitely get the wine cask on the finish which has just the right tannic bite to cut the sweetness on the palette. Lovely dram.

Palate: A sweet, silken and perfectly oily arrival with a cereal and light fruity profile. Vanilla and milk chocolate, butter and brown sugar. Effortlessly enjoyable.

Finish: Medium/short. Sweet, syrupy cereal. Slightly spearmint aftertaste.

Very rich, rounded and sweet whisky that shows off the character of grain distillate exceptionally well. The red wine cask maturation is beautifully handled, being almost undetectable in itself but adding a fruity sweet intensity throughout.

Crazy easy to drink with the alcohol giving a warming sensation but no burn at all. This is not a whisky of great character in which you get lost among the complexity - it's a reasonably priced seductive indulgence.

The official score of 92 here does seem just a little generous, however.

3.0,"I’ll admit that even though my Mum was born in Dublin, I’m a relative newcomer to the charms of finer Irish Whiskey (the American 50% of me prefers Kentucky Bourbon!)

I now understand that Teeling is definitely on its own path and not following traditional Irish Whiskey mash bills, which is intriguing.  However, this unconventional 97% Corn/3% Malted Barley whiskey—is a “cornpone” style mash straight out of Tennessee—but not a good one. 

Finished in red wines barrels, this Teeling Single Grain is a bit of a miss for me, despite the “professional” review of 92 here.  I’d give it an 82.  Initially there’s a huge whiff of hot ethanol on the nose that hits the palate immediately after, covering whatever flavor nuances might be there. Even though I usually appreciate the higher proof bottlings, this actually opens just a bit (a very little bit) with a splash of water.  I don’t notice any impact from the red wine barrel finishing whatsoever. 

I hate to say it, but the lesser reviewed “Small Batch” blended offering finished in ex-Flora Cana rum casks is far more interesting, if a bit sweeter on the finish. Its more cohesive and it’s also 25% less expensive than this one—and a far better value. 

$10 more buys you Redbreast and another $10 gets you Green Spot—both immensely superior drams. At least I can say I’ve tried it, but I won’t be buying this again. I’ll stick to the bargain Small Batch."

4.25,"America invented corn whisky, but most of it sucks. This, and Bain's Cape Mountain, are stunning examples of corn spirits done well. Teeling has taken what is normally a loud and garish grain, tamed it with age in wine barrels, but kept a heft of corn's character. 

Up front it's creamy, sweet, and vanilla. It follows with this vegetal funk that is like a belch after eating a whole pile of coleslaw. You'd think that would be bad, but it works here and it's perfect. Like a beautiful woman who has kind of messed up teeth. The best diamonds have a slight flaw, right?

More pricey than I would like which kills my enthusiasm a bit. But still, worth getting."

2.5,"It smells really sweet, like toffee. It tastes like a sharp hit of alcohol up front and then is really mild overall. Then it gets really boring."

4.5,Smells sugar sweet like wine. Flavor much lighter than the scent. Spicy finish that sticks around.
4.25,95% corn 5% barley.  Aged 7-8 years in untoasted wine barrels.  Smells like wine.  Very smooth with a hint of wine.
2.5,Nose is hot like rubbing alcohol. Taste isn’t much better. A little sweet like Pops cereal. Toffee finish and really tannic. Not worth the price at all. The other expressions are much much better.
2.0,Not what I expected. Very light and corny.
2.75,Berry lemonade on the nose after the first sip. Smelled like moonshine before that. Creamy taste and decent finish. Not overly impressed but very different than the small batch and single malt.
4.25,Damn good smooth Irish whiskey with sweet cream vanilla notes! Yum!
2.75,Single grain sweet finish

4.0,"Light refreshing smell, sweet Irish taste, a little chocolate."
3.0,"Lot of complexity but definitely feel that 46% strength. Aroma of corn and a grape sweetness. It’s warm to the taste immediately with a corn and bready taste with some banana, spice and dark chocolate dry finish. Just a strong ethanol taste thruout"
5.0,"Let sit for about a minute.

👀: Very light golden hue, structurally thin but expansive legs;

👃: Immediate woods, baking spices and fruit, sweetness peeks out from within; 

👅: Full-bodied taste full of sweet malts, dry finish, fruits in the middle;

🏁: Dry but lasting finish, tasty and full."

3.5,"Nose - Green apples, oak spice, and sweet vanilla. Hint of coconut.
Taste - Corn syrup, fruity.
Finish - Medium to long length. Metallic/vodka aftertaste.

On the nose, this smells like a wheated bourbon blended with Irish shortbread. Very sweet and pleasant.

On the palate, there's an initial burst of flavor and ethanol bite, but it's immediately turned down, sort of like when you start your car, but you forgot how loud the stereo was and you rush to turn the volume down.

The finish is sweet and clingy. It tastes like a sugar and syrup solution. There's a hint of the metallic taste I get from Jameson that I typically associate with neutral spirits/vodka.

I prefer the Teeling Small Batch to this, but it is still an enjoyable whiskey. I would call it simple compared to Teeling's other offerings, but more complex than many of the other, cheaper Irish whiskies I have tried"
3.75,"This is the Irish whiskey I took the leap from Traditional to Craft. Still has that Irish classic. The wine barrels play the part in dryness. Nose and finish. It's no Tennessee whiskey by any means; with all that corn and all. Still Irish. Think, how a craft brewery brews Lagers? Would be a crowd pleaser at a bonfire or around Christmas. My most likely go to for Teeling."
