4.0,"Nose is lavender and rubbing alcohol, with a sweet, spicy, and viscous body. Finish is remarkably smooth given the proof, with a nice heat. Would definitely buy. (Advent calendar, day 5.)"

Palate is woody and spice but still sweet stewed fruits. 

Finish is medium with wood and spice and light
