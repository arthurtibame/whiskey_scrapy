3.0,"Takes some getting used to, red wine for sure. Always wanted to try this! Its rather sweet amd wood like, not very complex though. The finish is not as long as I would have hoped for. Maybe a little overpriced. But a good one to try for sure!"

3.5,"Barley malt, 4years on red wine casks, unchilled and unfiltered. Cask 220A, bottle 373.

Nice sweet and smooth nose. The first taste is round and warm with notes of fruits and honey and nuts. That first taste is a bit short and does not linger very long. It has a nice aftertaste. Its amber and gold colour go well with the taste."
