4.5,"Remember that eclipse from 2 years ago?  The one which was seen fully in a straight line from Oregon to South Carolina?  Well, that eclipse passed through a portion of Wyoming where this distillery is located .  Not having researched this fully, I’m not sure if it was simply released that day and slapped on with a pretty label, or if there was something special done in casks, maturation or other aspects to make it truly one-off special.  The pragmatist in me says it’s a label slap on.  The romantic in me hopes for the one-off.  Either way...this is pretty good.  Classic bourbon profile of oak, baking spices, all enveloped by a sweetness.  I’ve been a huge fan of Wyoming Whiskey, with a very personal bent towards all its products ever since I visited them years ago during a vacation to Wyoming.  Thanks to @GeologyJack for the pour!  I’ve been looking forward to this for a while now."

4.0,"The nose of this one requires time to really take in and saturate. Some notes are extremely easy to find. There's vanilla, almond and a bright caramel. However, upon sitting with it a moment longer, I found citrus and key lime pie, toasted crust and all. It's quite creamy.

This one isn't too sweet. While other bourbons give you a candy store, this is a more civilized portion, and it's quite nice. At 88 proof, the heat shows up, takes a picture with the group, then leaves pretty quickly. You have some residual heat balance on the throat, but again, it's a short visit.

On the exit, you'll find toasted grains and what I believe is chestnut. While I can't really speak to Wyoming Whiskey and their other variations on this line, I have to say this one is quite nice and does reward you for looking for it.

3.0,"I suggest putting a drip of water into this to open up the flavor palette. Without the water I get all the flavor on the nose and not much once it moves to the back - and very little aftertaste. After the water to open it up - it smells slightly fruity and malty. A very even taste front to back- fairly smooth, hints of vanilla and a fruity scent. Dark caramel in color. Overall, I enjoyed it and would drink it again. I am also originally from Wyoming and love the uniqueness of this small batch to commemorate the eclipse."
