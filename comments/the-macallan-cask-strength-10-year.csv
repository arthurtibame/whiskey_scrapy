4.75,"Nov 2019.
Bottle bought and opened at 2007.
Tasted by small tulip glass.
Powerful sweet sweeten dark roasted prune, sweeten dark plum, longan honey, maple syrup, rich thick botrytis tokaji, and Christmas cake in the bouquet.
Full body, super strong abv with raisin, sweeten heavily roasted plum juice, wood tannin, tree bark, better herbal tea, dried herb and dried gram masala spicys, leather tannin and asphalt in the palate.
Awesome smell but way too young way too strong even after opened for more than 12 years."
