4.0,Bottle was opened a few weeks ago. It's good. Sometimes ryes can be a little too raisin-y for me. This does have that note but it dissipates quickly. Feels like there's more heat than what I would normally expect from a 91 proof. The nose goes from raisin to candy corn to burnt marshmallow pretty fast. The alcohol and wood sometimes override all those other notes though. Is it worth the money? Not sure. I bought this bottle thinking it was the straight rye and was charged accordingly ($30?). When I got home I looked at the label again and realized the mistake.
