3.0,"Nose, mild deep smoke, roasted malt and caramelized fruit.
Taste:  Smooth, light smokey chocolate and a musty winey depth from the sherry.
Verdict: Pretty good, but not too offensive."

4.0,"[Whiskey Live New York 2016] - Going down the Tullibardine line, they're all fairly generic and tasteless.  The sherry iteration however I did find quite enjoyable.  The cask influence is noticable, a little bite is introduced to the mix, and the finish is long enough that you can remember what you just sampled.  If you're looking to try this brand out, start with the 500 and don't look back."
4.0,Rich vanilla and spice. The sherry finish shows.

4.0,Sweet and thick. A bit of burn. Very nice
3.0,"Good stuff, with the sherry finish really elevating this highland whisky. The nose is complex and lofty, with notes of popcorn, dried fruits and buttery caramel. The body is full and sweet, with additional nuttiness to complement the flavor. The finish is complex and pleasant, with a nice layer of granulated brown sugar. I enjoyed this."
4.0,Smaakt komt mooi op en is erg vol!

4.0,"A gift from D, and my first exposure to Tullibardine. Despite not being a Speyside, the 500 manages to deliver a truly balanced and sherry-forward scotch. If anything it might be a little *too* balanced, with there almost nothing on the nose despite its 43% ABV, and on the palette the sherry is the predominant flavour with only hints or complexity behind it. Would certainly seek this again nonetheless."

4.0,"a bit of a burner, but good flavours up front and a lasting finish that ends with some good oak and Sherry."
3.0,"Dried fruit, brown sugar and pumpkin spice on the nose, followed by some dark chocolate, pecans and heavy oak tannins on the palate. The finish is spicy, of medium length, but ends with an unfortunate bitter aftertaste. Complex and respectable dram, but not as smooth as I had hoped."

3.0,It has some of the sweetness that you would expect from a sherry cask but the bite is still too harsh.

3.75,Dramfest '18. Not to bad at all.  Several drams in and it held its own.  Nothing special but has rich sherry flavour.  3.75.

4.0,"If you enjoy Glendronach, Glenmorangie, Glengoyne, then this is a must have. Coats the mouth, lots of sherry, vanilla, brown sugar and some baking spices. I'll be buying another bottle. Awesome."

Palate: sweet, oily and round. Toffee and caramel again and lots of sherry influence with some citrus notes.

Finish: medium to long with a soft spicy touch and some oak influence"

3.75,"Nose like apple brandy, with a rich dessert like flavor profile and hint of spice.  Not really buttery like some reviews say.  A little hot in the finish."

4.5,"My first Tullibardine was a very nice dram, an interesting sherry finished whisky which surprised me for its raw Pedro Ximenez flavor. Anyone who has tasted a Pedro Ximenez Sherry and a whisky matured in a PX cask will know that even if they are ""kind of cousins"" in flavor profile, they are not exactly the same; well... this Tullibardine Sherry Finish delivers a wonderful aftertaste that is the most similar flavor to a sherry wine that i have ever tasted.

Bottled at 43%abv, tawny color.

On the nose it is a little dim, dry Cake, Dulce de leche, Tobacco, Brown grass, Blackberries and some Herbal notes.

On the palate it is wonderful. Honey, Px sherry, Blackberry marmalade, and suddenly a pleasant Spice bomb.
Super sweet and spicy. Clove.

Aftertaste is superb. It is a Sherry wine. First you feel this bitter tobacco sensation to then explode into the finest of Pedro Ximenez Sherry Wine. Not whisky, but sherry wine. Very well done sir.

Overall, i can tell you that this whisky delivers the promise of a ""sherry finish"" since its definitively a highland malt that you taste and enjoy and suddenly it gets silent for one second and then, boom!  A sherry wine ending. 92/100. Great dram."
4.25,"Nose: Chocolate, dark fruits, chocolate, creme brulee crust, chocolate.

Taste: Chocolate, orange peel. 

A very enjoyable dram."
