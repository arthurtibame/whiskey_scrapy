3.75,"Nose: Smells like a bourbon initially, vanilla, toffee and butterscotch candy, a little dried apple.

Palate: Warm but not as sweet as it smells. Good heat that dissipates quickly with nice caraway notes. Nice smooth mouthfeel. Balanced and not overly complicated. Would make good cocktails.

Finish: Long, slightly bitter, more caraway, rye bread."
3.5,Above-average rye. Pleasant spiciness and a mild sweetness. Has a slight sugar-cookie finish.
