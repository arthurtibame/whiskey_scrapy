4.0,"Heavy char, light blueberry and molasses on the nose.  Strong oak and leather with slight hints of cinnamon and smoked molasses going down.  Long and strong finish.  Smooth"

3.75,"Sweet and mellow, zero burn whatsoever. Tasted side by side with the EH Taylor 4 Grain as this is also a 4 grain mash bill. The general difference I got was that EHT had a noticeably longer finish, but outside of that the two seemed incredibly similar on the palate. Cherry Vanilla Caramel light spice on the finish."
4.25,Something’s happening in my mouth...smokiness? Oak? Says it’s American oak so...maybe?

3.5,"Securing this bottle was a bit more difficult than I had planned. I am a big fan of Woody Creek’s ryes (in particular their single barrel offering), and when I heard they had a straight bourbon I knew I needed to try it. 

So, on my last trip to Colorado over Thanksgiving I planned a special trip to Basalt to experience the distillery. Things did not go as planned, as a car accident diverted us off the freeway and into a blizzard. We never made it to Basalt, but I did find a bottle at a small liquor store in Steamboat Springs. Was it worth it…?

Nose: Cinnamon, honey, a hint of shoe leather.
Palate: Orange peel, spicy, a bit oaky. Finish is mild but long.
Water adds a lovely spice to the nose, and much needed balance to the palate. Improves the finish as well.
Overall: a solid offering from a good distiller. Neat, the flavors don’t quite work, but just a drop of water made a big difference for me."
