3.0,Not very interesting
4.25,"Nose: Fruity (a wine like red grape mustiness), a little sugar candy, white wine mustiness, hint of wine soaked oak, sour rye, candied lime, pomegranate juice, hint of maple, a little peppermint, hint of red wine vinegar, Marsala wine, sweet creamy corn, slightly sweet wood spice

Palate: Blast of caramel and fortified wine sweetness, some chocolate liquor, mocha, Marsala wine, funky peanuts and almonds, oak cask bitter paprika and spice, dry white vermouth notes (with botanicals), candied lemon, very slight peppermint, a strange but interesting flavour of eggy French toast with cinnamon and syrup 

Finish: Grape peels, French toast, rich and sweet oak spice, black tea"
