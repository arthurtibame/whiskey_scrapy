4.0,"After the pinnacle of bourbon brilliance that is the Belle Meade 9 year old single cask, this was bound to be a little bit of a letdown. Once you've seen the Promised Land, even a Hawaiian vacation seems sad in comparison. This is still a fine offering, however. A nose of vanilla, sour dill pickle, spices, and wood leads into a dry, wine-inflected (duh) palate with the usual markings of a high rye mashbill bourbon. The finish is dry, woody, and reminiscent of a dry white wine. It's not bad, and it does have a unique personality, but I would never pay the really steep recommended retail for this."

2.0,Lots of that unsweetened chocolate flavor comes through for me. Not what I expected for Vanilla being a main tasting note. Not terrible but definitely not worth $80 on my shelves.

4.0,"Solid, if you want a sweeter, vanilla-rich bourbon. Some rye kick, which I like, but smoother and sweeter than a typical rye. I need to try the much-beloved 9-year cask Belle Meade to see the difference but so far this is a great first taste from this brand of bourbon, and one of my early favorites."
4.0,"Wood and herbal notes on the nose. Butterscotch as well. The rye content is noticeable on the palate. Some floral notes, mint, and spice. A slight kick of vanilla, then bitterness at the end. 8/21/17
Very rich. 9/1/17"

4.5,Vanilla and oak meet the nose with a hint of grape. The dark fruit flavors are coupled well with rich honey. The rye gives this a little burn and spice on the finish. Overall a great mixture of sweet and spice.

3.75,"Definitely deserving of 90+ rating, very easy drinking and smooth. I would expose a newby bourbon drinker to this juice and they won’t get burned. However, my preference was for the sherry finished version from this distillery. The sherry cask finish knocks it out of the park!!"
4.25,"From the nose which exhibits the cask, dark fruits, and toffee, to the dark amber hue when poured neatly, it's one fine drink. The overall rich yet smooth flavor this cask finished bourbon exhibits is fantastic at the price point I found it at. If I had to pay the normal $65 I would still have been satisfied albeit less so... Solid, yet from what I've been told it no longer is being bottled.. Look for it on the cheap if you can..."

Not as sweet as i expected considering it is finished in wine barrels which is actually a good thing. The mouthfeel was a little thin with a medium finish."

4.0,"375ml in a three-bottle special cask finish series box.  Batch no. 18-04, bottle no. 4606.  Actually a great deal at $99.99, as buying the three bottles in 750ml totals $225. Tasted all three in a row, Cognac-Madeira-Sherry.

Neat in Glencairn at home.  Nose has some candied orange peel, astringent oak, mild baking spices, sweet grape must.  Taste is deeper and less astringent, with apple and cloves coming out over the sweet vinous notes, with come orange peel and spices lingering.  Tasty.  1/30/2020."

4.75,"Wow. found this for $60 in a little shop in Maryland and it was a great buy. The Madeira adds Rich fruity notes which are a nice counter to the high spice and vanilla tones. It has a good body, and long finish. I would keep this on my shelf in my regular rotation."
3.5,Took a tour of in Nashville. Great place to visit. Tasting bar was great. Excited about the future of this brand. Bourbon was great for a distillery finding its path. Would go back and buy again. A bit Smokey with vanilla and orange. Heavy scent but I could not pick up on a clear description.

4.0,"Belle Meade - is the name French or Old English?  What does it matter - they are producing amazing bourbon journeys that drink like, and approach, single malts.  

I bought this gift box of 3X375ml bottles for $89.95, encompassing three cask expressions: this one, the Cognac Cask, and the Sherry Cask. It's a bargain in my book, and I like the direction Belle Meade is going with all of them.  

In my dreams, if I were the Chairman of the Board of bourbon, I'd call this 9 year old spirit, 'Chest Candy'.   The expert notes are succinct, without hype or mystery.  Again, the taste profile equals some entry-level scotches, sans the nuttiness.  Is this a unicorn bottle on the cheap?  No... but it won't suck unicorn c**k just to drink it, either... 

Recently, after a dram of this, I poured myself a ""regular""-casked bourbon. And lo and behold, that was delicious like no-one's business.  I think a bottle of this can, and will, increase appreciation of your liquor cabinet. It did mine.

4.25,"Second of cask finish trio. Ok now we are getting somewhere. I like this much more than the cognac finish. Deep rich color, thick pungent nose, heavy handed flavors and long finish. Poured neat, nose is meaty dark red fruits(mainly black cherry), sweet pipe tobacco, salted nuts and varnished oak. Let it air out and in comes some super ripe peach and the spicy rye nudges its way in too. Mouth feel on all the Belle Meades is very good no exception here. Palate is healthy smack of toffee, cherry and spicy rye. There's dark chocolate, nuts and sweet barrel. Its full of long lasting flavors that carry to finish. Cocoa and molasses with rye and oak ride off into the sunset. The fruits linger in the background to complete the show. Tad hot for proof but so good it doesn't matter. This is very similar to some of the better Old Forester variants so if you like OF100 or 1920 you will most likely be a fan. Is it worth the high price tag($70-80) well that's up to you. I think its more complex and refined than OF and the bottle has improved dramatically since opening so I just may spring for the 750ml of this..........92/100......Leaves only the sherry finish and L&G we have a clear winner"

3.75,Decent Bourbon but its very mild in offering any real memorable flavor profile from the   MADEIRA CASK FINISH.
4.25,"Neat. Neck pour.  Wine influence is heavy upfront.  Like a dark raspberry jam.  Behind that is oak with a hint of peanut.  Vanilla surfaces as I get used to the other flavors.  Baking spices emerges upfront.  Perfect bourbon to try right before Thanksgiving.  I can imagine this going quite well with Turkey, gravy, cranberries.

Rich, coating mouth but not creamy.  Medium oil.  The vanilla and wine influence is intense in the tongue from the start.  Kicks you in the teeth with the raspberries and berries.  Like biting into a berry and choose just explodes around the rest of your mouth.  Vanilla, oak and a hint of chocolate stay behind on the medium-short legs.  

I am impressed by this.  The Madeira leaves a stronger impression than the Sherry and Port finished whiskeys I have tried.  Those deep fruit/jam flavors are overwhelming and intense but subside to let the whiskey shine too.  Quite happy about this."

3.75,Great bourbon. Oak and vanilla and moderately sweet. I prefer this to the Sherry cask.
3.75,"I’ve had their regular bourbon, which I enjoy. So I thought I’d spice it up with this one.

On the nose I get vanilla, sweet leather, baking spices, some smokiness, a little rye and plumb. I also get raisins on later nosings.

The palate is rich, oily and has a nice sweetness. I get some oak, cherries and some rye spice. 

The finish is is nice and long with a slight bitterness on the end.

Fairly easy to drink and has some nice flavors going on. It is a welcome variation to their bourbon, which I also like."
3.0,The Madeira didn't seem to add enough. Good but not striking
