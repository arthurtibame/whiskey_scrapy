Mortlach is the savings bond of whisky.  Putting it in a cask is a long term investment that has the lowest risk of failure.  Original bottlings get shat on, but the older ones are not bad whisky; they are just overpriced, and Diageo’s attempts to doll up the bottles for the luxury market are cringe-worthy.  The overpriced official 18 year old was good; I’m sure the overpriced official 25 year old is good, but nobody without bipolar disorder on an epic manic episode will ever buy it; and the current 16 year old is even decent value for money.  But, if you really want a full Scotch experience at a fair price, get an independent Mortlach that is old enough to buy alcohol.

This G&M 25 year old is actually fairly available.  It is more contemplative and gentle than what is typical from “The Beast of Dufftown.”  The serving strength of 43% undoubtedly contributes.  But there is a mesmerizing rough harmony to this one that can snap you out of a daydream about something else, and have you just as quickly daydream about this instead; like a Corrine Bailey Rae song.  Hard and soft, at the same time.

Okay, some actual notes.  Tropical fruits in gummy bear form, fresh pineapple, and Cara Cara navels – it’s very fresh and floral with an exotic sweetness at the beginning.  Chocolate and herbal tea notes develop later on.  You have to really move the whisky around in the mouth to get that classic Mortlach burly meatiness, with a touch of ginger and white pepper.  The texture is fairly oily and the flavors cling for a soft but longlasting finish. 

This is an exemplary whisky.  Perfectly balanced and perfectly priced.

Score: ** (unimaginably good)
How much does a bottle cost: $230-270

4.5,"Another standout from last night’s tasting at @Richard-ModernDrinking.  I’m continually baffled that how is it Mortlach puts out lousy original bottlings, but the IBs are superb.  Something’s wrong with that logic.  

If I had this alone without having had the Michter 10 rye, Ardbeg 19, and Octomore 10, this would’ve been easily a 5 star pour.  But...when you’re in company of other superstars, you’ll get scrutinized a bit more than if you’re alone.  Nonetheless, damn good pour, showing tastes of hazelnut and light sherry.  Nutty  and buttery aftertaste.  Like maracona almonds.

Solid bottling by the always trusted G&M."

5.0,"Chocolate, raisins, damp soil and mulch mark the nose of this independently bottled Mortlach, a beguiling combination that keeps revealing new textures. The palate is equally complex: prunes, black tea, a little spice, caramel. The finish is long and gentle, with a hint of cocoa powder. I found the flavors on the 15-year-old from G&M disappointed muted, but its older sibling turns their volume up a couple of notches and mixes them with perfect balance. One of those whiskies that leaves me with a spring in my step."
