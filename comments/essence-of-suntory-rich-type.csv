5.0,"Tried this at a dekanta tasting. 12 year Yamazaki white oak whisky finished for a further 6 years in cedar head casks blended with Yamazaki sherry cask and Mizunara cask whiskies aged for at least 18 years and Chita whiskies aged for at least 18 years. Outstanding. Best of the night. Possibly better than Yamazaki 18 and Hibiki 21. This has notes of Raisins, Chocolate, Toffee, Figs, Vanilla, Flowers, Lychee, Sudachi, Walnuts, Almond Pastry, Sandalwood, Plums, Cherries, Caramel, and Yuzu."
