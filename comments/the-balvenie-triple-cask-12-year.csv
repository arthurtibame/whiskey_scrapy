3.0,"I have to say that I am quite underwhelmed by The Balvenie's Triple cask single malt.  Available only in the Travel/Duty Free markets, this scotch is supposed to add a third finish to the Doublewood which, in theory, sounds wonderful, however it fails to provide anything memorable or even remotely interesting to the nose and palate.  ""Light honey and yellow apples"" is a combination that is grossly overdone in the single malt category...and Glenfiddich does that combo best (IMHO that is).

Nose: Light honey and yellow apples but very weak
Taste: Starts with very mild honey and fruit...vanilla gives a passing nod...some mild heat and a slight bitter note.
Finish: Medium with some mild vanilla notes and astringent feel.

My Rating: 70 out of 100."

4.0,"So far The Balvenie are a bit like Richard Linklater for me - a safe pair of hands and usually can be relied on to deliver the goods (and it seems Everybody Wants Some).

First tasted (ahem, Before Midnight) after a Glenfiddich 15yo Solera and a Scapa. I was impressed but the longer I drank it the more I thought it had a cloying sweetness. Perhaps this was in comparison to the Scapa which, while sweet enough, had a maritime saltiness. In any event, in later samplings I didn't get that over-sweetness. 

It had a pleasant smell of chocolate, candied fruits, baileys cream, and a bit of fresh sawdust (oak?). A light, spicy taste with clove and orange mainly registering.  No real need for water - only a sparing drop or two. The finish was on the short side.  Four stars.

Looking forward to my unopened Single Barrel 15 year old."
3.5,"Nose: Almonds, apple, honey, and a sligthly sour note. Palate: Extremely smooth, light, coconut, discreet fruit, vanilla. Finish: Pepper, oak, medium length.  All in all a pleasant experience that got better towards the end of the bottle."

4.0,"This was purchased for me, at the Brussels, Belgium airport. The appearance is gold. The nose is white bread, light peat, and a trace of cocktail sherry. The flavor is barley grain, standard whisky flavor (any style), and a hint of barrel char. Mouthfeel is medium, and the whisky lingers on, a bit. No smoke was detected, in either the aroma or the taste. I hope it wasn't expensive, because this is rather bland, I am sad to report. Still good (80%, ""B-""), though. RJT"

3.5,"Nose: Honey, malt, sweet cereal, some dried red apples and orange peel - it's reminiscent of a muesli snack bar. There are oak notes but they are light and more like sawdust than old cask. There is also a minty presence that comes out as it rests, and a little toffee. The nose never gains great complexity but it is very well balanced and enjoyable.

Palate: Soft arrival and a luscious texture, fruity and malty with a touch of gentle spice. Relaxed development with apricot, a little light honey, some trace vanilla and a touch of sweet weak black tea. Creamy but slightly dry. The more you taste it the more you become aware of the oloroso presence and the fact that the palate and finish are fundamentally of a sherried character, but the wine presence is never overt and this is nothing like a sherry-bomb.

Finish: Medium. Fruity/malt notes fade into a pleasantly sweet aftertaste with trace flourishes of warm cinnamon, clove and orange.

This is a lighter, crisper style of Balvenie than the 12 year Doublewood, and indeed most of the core range. The nose is very pleasant but the palate is superior and where the real personality resides. If you find the Doublewood a little too heavy on the caramel and sweet fruity notes this may well be more to your taste. It would be an over-simplification to say this is the Doublewood with additional oloroso cask maturation, but not entirely inaccurate.

I've never had a bad Balvenie and this very pleasant expression carries on the tradition. 3% higher abv could be interesting, but might also make it less approachable for some palates. At 40% it can't take much water so if doing so just add a drop or two, but it's not really needed. This is fine as it is.

The only issue I have is the price which at 150% the cost of the 12 year Doublewood is too high for my liking. However if you can find it on special it's a recommend buy.

To misquote the late, great John Martyn ""some whiskies are just plain good"".

""Good"" : 3.5 stars"

Bottled at 40%abv, russetmuscat color.

On the nose: Bananas, caramel, honey and Salt. 
On the Palate, it was spicy in a pleasant way, with pepper; chilli and ashes. Caramel was present there. The finish was medium long. Overall it was a 75/100, a fair dram."
