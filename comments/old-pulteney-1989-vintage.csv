5.0,"One more Drinks by the Dram opened.  This won the World Whisky award as best single malt ( how many awarding bodies are there??!  Till recently, I thought it was Jimbo Murray only?).  It's a 26 yr old Old Pulteney that's been fully matured in an ex-heavily peated cask.  Which means it's a Highlander that thinks it's an Islay, but brings characteristics of both to the table.   Nose:  really liking this.  If you close your eyes, you can smell the ocean.  Briny, salty.  The peat doesnt appear at all.  Taste:  like citrus fruits, with a strong dose of brine and salt.  No sweetness at all.  Now the peat shows up, but quite delicate.   Almost a tangy lime-lemon lassi, where the glass is rimmed with salt.  There's a funny leafy taste as well.  Like marijuana (not that I would know, but I grew up in the inner city---I recognize it.  )   Finish is loooong.  Feels like  that taste of the ocean when you're swimming, and you catch  a bit of water down your pipe.  In a good way.  If tasted blind, I'd have guessed a well aged Talisker.  Not the brute 10, but maybe the 30 (never had it, but I imagine that to be an understated elegance).   Is this the 2016 World's best?  Who knows...and not sure I care.  But it's good...and I'm glad I bought a small sample earlier in the year before it was declared World's best."
