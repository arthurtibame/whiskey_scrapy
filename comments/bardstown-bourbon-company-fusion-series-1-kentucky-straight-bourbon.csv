3.5,"Light nose. Initially spicy, but drops off quickly. Slight floral palate. Young and bitter notes, but not overwhelming. A slight, sweet, cola note at the end. This is nice. 9/2/19"

4.0,"Nose is filled with hints of sweet raisins and cherries. Lemon zest is faint in the background. Palate is salty caramel with a huge wave of vanilla spice. Spice is dominant.  Finish is medium length and flashes some leather, sweet cream and cherry coke, then more leather. Mouthfeel is excellent. Need to be open minded with this one as it’s unique and inviting. The spice is upfront but transitions to lovely but medium length finish. Great new blended bourbon that I would gladly purchase again."

4.5,"Nose... Ice cream sundae with chocolate, caramel and nuts.. Butterscotch and finally green apples...

Color...Mid to dark copper

Taste... Sweet corn followed by a strong bite of rye. A touch of leather and butterscotch are apparent as well...

Overall... I really think that they've come up with a fantastic fusion of old and new in this bottle. The matured 11 year Kentucky very much balances the young and biting 2 year blends. This is one heck of a solid whiskey, well done and hats off...."
4.5,Great nose - smooth and easy going with vanilla peeking through. Taste is different than what you'd expect from the nose. Still smooth and lighter but far less sweet than nose would have you believe.

2.5,"Not worth the price. A bit woody/grainy, young."
4.25,"Nice tasting bourbon that had a primary nose of chocolate to me and then forward with cherries once it hits your mouth. I like the story of the distillery and I’ll definitely keep an eye out for future releases of theirs as they get older. However, for this price point I wouldn’t buy another bottle."

2.5,"Whilst off on vacation in the picturesque city of Lake Tahoe CA I stumbled across this Bourbon. It's not one I had previously seen before in my local market but had heard generally positive things about this Distillery. This release is a blend of the following:

40% is an 11yr 7month old sourced Bourbon from Kentucky (74% corn, 18% rye and 8% malted barley)

18% 2yr old Bardstown distillate (68% corn, 20% wheat and 12% malted barley)

42% 2 yr old Bardstown distillate (60% corn, 36% rye and 4% malted barley)

Let's see how it tastes:

On the palette it's a soft and fairly thin entry with vanilla, some brown sugar and a hint of cherries. There is a pepper swell from the mid palette thru the finish and then some more cherries. It's pretty easy to drink and very simple. It's not bad per se it's just not great. It looks like the SRP on this is $60 and at that price it's a hard pass for me. For a $10/pour it was interesting enough but I won't get another. Cheers all!"

4.0,"Nose: spicy, with hints of cream and zesty citrus, butterscotch, cherries

Palate: spicy caramel, fruits

Finish: more fruits and some cinnamon. Shirt to medium finish 

This bourbon reminds me of something, but since this is my first tasting I will reserve judgement. It’s pleasantly complex. I’m glad to see more bourbon blends hitting the market. Some of the Barrell Bourbon offerings were great. I will say that if you enjoyed the discontinued Ancient Ancient Age 10-year or Barton Bottled-in-Bond— also discontinued — you’ll definitely  dig this."
3.5,Fruity on the nose. Very easy to drink. Smooth. Sweet. Short finish. Good daily drinker.
3.75,"The gift shop was providing free samples of the distillery's brand-new ""Fusion"" release, which melds together some of their first barrels of two-year-old juice (60%) with a much older, sourced 11-year, 7-month old bourbon (40%).  The detail level of my notes drops off late in the day, particularly after trying so many excellent whiskies, but I did note that this new release exhibited a surprisingly creamy texture with mature, rich flavors, and a mule kick's worth of rye spice at the tail end.  The older bourbon in this release melded beautifully with the youthful, vibrant, barely-there bourbon that makes up the majority of the blend.  I liked it a lot!  At $60, the price is a little steep, but it offers a chance to try one of the first efforts from one of bourbon country's most promising newcomers."

2.5,Very bitter.   Tastes of an un aged bourbon.    This one is tough.

2.75,"I felt lucky I was able to acquire this bourbon because (1) it's not available in my state, (2) a high-demand item that sells out quickly, and (3) was on sale for $5 off their price. 

Popular opinion or not, I'll just say it... It's not worth the price tag. For a bourbon that retails at $60, I expected a more full, rich, thick, and spicy palette in league with single barrels, cask strengths, barrel proofs, or non-chill filtered types. And if I'm not mistaken, this isn't even any of those types... just a plain blended bourbon. The fact they use an 11-yr old blend still doesn't justify because there are other brands that blend 16-yr old bourbons, for example, with a lower price tag.

Not considering any details above, however, if I were handed this drink, I'd be very delighted and enjoyed it. It is good. If asked how much I thought a bottle would be, I would have ranged it at $35-$45, though."
4.5,"Spicy, bold rye taste."

3.75,"Was told (or sold) that this was the clerk’s favorite bourbon.  It’s smooth, has a slight rye spice that is smoothed out by the wheat blend.  It is a good pour, but I have a lot of other bourbons that I prefer at this price."

4.5,"Nose: Charred oak, caramelized sugar, vanilla.  Cream.  Creme brulee comes to mind.  Cherries and blackberries.  Peaches, bananas.  Salted caramel.  Buttermilk Biscuits.  Slight herbaceousness.  Dusty corn.

Palate: Caramel, toffee, corn, oak, vanilla.  Medium tannin.  Mango, banana, dragonfruit.  Slight perfume-y floral note.  Char.  Leather   Finish is medium long - mellows out into more fruity notes and then the ethanol shows back up with a nice, bright turn"
