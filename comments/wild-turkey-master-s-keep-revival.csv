4.0,"Nose - Dark caramel, dark chocolate, candied cherries, charred cinnamon, dark roasted coffee beans, fruity oak.

Taste - Dark dried cherries, dark, almost burnt toffee, light oaky bitter coffee grounds, light charred cinnamon burn/heat, dark chocolate.

Finish - Lingering cinnamon spice/heat, bit tannic/dry, lingering sweet bitter oaky cherry, dark cocoa nib bitterness, dark burnt toffee.

Score - 89/100

Final Thoughts - This was an interesting one as it added an additional layer of dark cherry to what I'd consider a slightly oaky Wild Turkey profile. Although this one is tasty in its own right, I think it is a bit on the dry/tannic side and although I'm a fan of the fruity/coffee/cocoa nib bitterness in it, the tannic nature throws it a bit off balance. I'm not sure what they did but it feels a tad bit over oaked to me. I sadly think this would make a MUCH better chocolate cherry old fashioned as I think the bitters & dilution would help out the tannic nature of this beautifully.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - Not another one"

5.0,One of the best wild turkey editions thus far. I will be hunting for another bottle to keep.  The sherry finish stays with you and the flavor stays on the tongue.  What a wonderful release from the Russel’s
5.0,Very good... an absolute pleasure of a bourbon.  Cherry pie on the nose.  Intense vanilla and brown sugar while maintaining hints of the sherry on the palate.  Long oaky finish.  This is up there with the big boys.  I haven’t had many better!
5.0,"Yeah, this is a bomb.  Not a sherry bomb, like in scotch parlance, but in a descriptor of effervescent joy.  I have never had a more enjoyable bourbon(esque) drinking experience.  Complex, and it doesn't hammer you over the head like some unruly child.  Instead, it draws you in like a warm fire on a cold night.  One of the best spirits ever.  Bravo!"

4.5,"Nose - oak, leather, stone fruit, vanilla
    
    Palate - toffee, creamy vanilla, cinnamon, cooked fruit
    
    Finish - medium, a bit on the dry side but with some lingering sweetness from the sherry influence.
        
    What a I really like about this is the balance between the sweetness, spice and oak. I haven't been a huge fan of some of the other WT expressions I've tried, too much pepper/heat; but for me the sherry finish here smooths out the rough edges without completely taking over. 
    
    If anything is a bit of a letdown it's the finish, it just doesn't have the richness that some higher-proof bourbons do on the finish. So I have to take a 1/2 star for that and say this is a solid 4.5"
5.0,Worth the money
4.0,You can tell this is Turkey from the first sniff. Char notes abound in a classic  bourbon that tastes well aged and balanced. Very well done.

5.0,"Nose-Vanilla in spades.
Body- Fruit notes come through immediately with vanilla and ends in a very prominent black pepper spice. This is definitely a tongue tingler.
Finish- Vanilla gives way to some rye spice notes. 

Second best WT I have had."
5.0,"I dedicate this bottle to my gramma.

The sherry barrels come through in the entire drink, in a very good way. It’s the dominant scent on the nose, and it hits in the body, along with a deep cherry flavor. I get a corn flavor on the finish, along with the sherry of course. Fantastic flavor profile.

If you’ve had diamond anniversary, the flavor profile is similar, just amplified by the sherry barrel finish. I actually prefer the diamond. I’d call it a cleaner flavor profile, but this drink is still phenomenal."

4.5,The Revival is much more balanced and matured than the Decades and other master series. The oloroso cask adds a lot more interesting notes. Overall fairly smooth with long finish and good flavor.

4.75,"Taste:  Neat in glen cairn, sitting 15 minutes

Nose: (4.75):  Excellent sweet fragrance.  Full of fruit, carmel, with a hint of butterscotch.  Enough ethanol to let you know it will have that Turkey bite, but mild enough not to overwhelm

Palate: (5) Strawberry jam, cornmeal, caramel and raisins hit you first, gives way to an almost fig newton type chewy taste. Coats the mouth evenly like butter. You can catch the sweetness of the sherry, but it does not overwhelm the bourbon.  The complexity is superb.  This is Wild Turkey at its finest.

Finish: (4.5)  Finish is dry and tannic.  Peanut butter dominates the finish.  You can taste that the aging has taken great care.  Hats off to the Russells."

4.5,"Merry Christmas to me! Picked up a bottle today and enjoying a few drams of this great whiskey. As posted previously, I am a WT fanboy (101 and Rare Breed are standards in my home) so naturally had try this one. This is 101 but with more character, complexity and SPICE!! It’s definitely fruitier due to the sherry influence but is packed with oak, vanilla sweetness, and instead of baking spices like in their other whiskey, this is different with black peppercorn also playing a role. It’s viscous, with incredibly long legs and a nice medium length finish. This Master’s Keep is quite different than the Decades version and certainly enjoying it a bit more too. Cheers!"
4.25,Fruit aroma with a kick of rubbing alcohol. The taste has strong Cocoa with a touch of fruit jam. Once I added a small piece of ice the rubbing alcohol  aroma was gone. What you are left with Smokey fruit aroma. Great sipping bourbon. Nice Christmas present to yourself.

5.0,"Neat.  That nose is delightful.  There is a creaminess to the nose (which is odd to me.)  Chocolate and fruit with vanilla.  Some baking spices back there.  Pastries all combined.  I could sniff this for a long time.  Proof never hits me no matter how hard I smell it.  

Wow strawberry jam.  Let that sit on your tongue and the flavors just ooze.  Oak, chocolate and spices on the finish.  

The nose is even more delicious now.  And I can still taste it minutes later.  It’s a special treat."

4.75,"Huge. Extraordinary complexity. Nutty. Stale peanut brittle. Fresh, dry roasted hazelnuts, almonds, pecans, and Brazils. Raisins, figs, prunes, chocolate, vanilla, dates, rye, barley, barrel char. Perfect balance of dry vs sweet, dark red grapes, sour cherries and artificial cherries, fresh and dried fruits, rich oaky butterscotch from the 20 y.o. sherry, which also imparts a tannic, drying mouth-feel. Mouthwatering effect. Plums, red and black liquorice. Sherry up front met with bourbon and more sherry in the middle and somewhat leaning towards bourbon but with more sherry in the end. Sherry and barrel spice lingers on the aftertaste. The casks and barrels were expertly married, it's neither sherry nor bourbon dominant overall, it's very well integrated, and not at all over-oaked. There's a lot of different notes very close together, yet all are discernable. Medium entry, long middle, and a medium-long finish. High quality, very satisfying, and certainly unique. A new experience. A huge whisky that is sure to get a reaction one way or another! Considering the cost of 20 y.o. sherry casks...at $147.95, this is a steal. I'd pay up to $225 for a rare experience like this. Don't approach it as a bourbon or a sherried whisky...embrace it as something new and unique, and enjoy the wild ride! 

Note: review edited...the somewhat seemingly conflicted notes that didn't seem to fully harmonize at first, have come together wonderfully now. Drinking very nice 4 months in. Give it time, you'll be rewarded."

Really nice and complex bourbon. Unique flavors from the sherry cask gives it some nice dark fruit and strawberry flavors. MSRP is a bit high, but it’s a very unique aged bourbon so it makes sense."

3.25,"Hands down the best thing Wild Turkey has done.

Nose - cherry, vanilla, oak, bready, jam, pie crust.  It might have a touch of medicinal note as well though i see that as more a jam thing.  

taste - opens sweet and fruity with jams and dark fruits.  then shifts to a nutty almost beam like nut.  then it shifts back and gives me that wild turkey oaky finish.  

This bottle has been open about 8 months and is just below the halfway point.  It's just great bourbon.  It's not exceptional, it's only 13 years, and wild turkey really isn't a premium bourbon brand imo.  Still, the sherry finish really hides some of wild turkey's cheaper flavor points.  

I'd get another bottle at the 130 range but I think that ship has sailed.  

If you like sherry bourbon this is a must get even at the premium pricing.  If sherry bourbon isn't your thing BUT this price point is in your wheel house and you're not against sherry notes in your bourbon, I'd consider this one as well."

3.5,"""Toasted nose, cherry on palate slightly thin, a little medicinal slight burn on top of tongue. Ok but not my favorite."""
4.5,"The sherry on the nose is very evident, and it tricked my brain into thinking that I might have grabbed a scotch by mistake.  There is something that reminds me of a sweet, fruity, cakey dessert.
On the palate, I get a strong rye spice from the start that lingers through the finish.  Along with the rye, I get cream and definitely some shortcake.  There is some heavy mintiness, which is a quality that I normally don't like, but it works a lot better with the cream and dessert flavors.  This is a nice whiskey- not necessarily something that I'd want to drink all the  time(nevermind the price and availability making that an impossibility) but it's a nice treat.

I'd buy this again despite being well over $100 a bottle."
