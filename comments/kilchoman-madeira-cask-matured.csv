4.0,"The forth sample of a 7 part Kilchoman (custom) sample set my wife got me for my birthday.
I tried this one shortly after the Sauterne Cask Matured release. As with that one, smoke was less obvious on the nose than on the palate. Again, a round body where I found dried fruits, raisins, some hints of salt, all nicely balanced. Add a nice, long aftertaste and we have another Kilchoman that I'd purchase anytime. Not exactly sure why, but I preferred this one (very) slightly over the Sauterne Cask Maturation. Perhaps it's nice, dark color?"
2.0,"Nose: Strong peppery wood smoke, like the aftermath of a bushfire rather than mellow peat smoke. A softer peat gradually emerges through the haze together with a  powerful winey note. These dominant aromas tend to swamp the nose.

Palate: Dense smoke, blazing hot white pepper and ginger, dusty dark chocolate, peat, fortified wine, raisins, prunes. A little harsh and hard.

Finish: Medium. Lingering smoke, wine and dry dark chocolate.
          
It’s not likely that you’ll still find this anywhere, so this review is more for historical interest.  In 2011 Kilchoman filled 17 first-fill ex-madeira casks as an experiment. I bought my bottle in 2016, which is the year after I believe it was bottled, so it had spent 4 years in very active and strongly-seasoned oak.

That’s a lot of time for the residual fortified wine and some cask elements to be absorbed, but hardly any time for serious maturation of the spirit. I can’t help but feel that it would have worked better to give the whisky 4 years in good bourbon casks and then half a year of finishing in the madeira wood.

Not surprisingly it gave me the impression of being undeveloped and awkward – a fresh young whisky covered with a dense blanketing layer of wood smoke and thick wine, but everything being disjointed, argumentative and restless. The heavy smoke seemed to improve with oxidization but it never achieved a really cohesive state with the wine element.  In the end this whisky came across as a failed experiment and it’s not surprising that they have not repeated it since. At $180 it was also quite expensive.

Kilchoman (who produce some whiskies that I particularly like) have since gone on to perfect their strategy with both Loch Gorm and Sanaig which are far more subtle and evolved products – buy one of those and don’t bother searching out this old Madeira expression. You’ll occasionally see a positive review but even for collectors I wouldn’t recommend it.

""Acceptable”: 2 stars"
