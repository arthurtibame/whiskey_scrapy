4.0,"A great dram. Its an enhanced Jack Daniel's. The story behind it is that the white Rabbit Saloon was the first to pour Jack Daniel's whiskey and therefore is a great part of its history. 

Bottled at 43% abv, tawny color. 

On the nose, it is a more complex JD. Maple syrup, Banana, Prunes, Reminds me of breakfast; Vanilla, Marzapan, Herbal spiciness. Really something nice. 

On the palate, it is bitter and has a sour prune flavor, herbal spiciness. Aftertaste was lovely: Actually a sweet honeyed stroofwaffle finish. Old Banana. Slight saltiness.

Nice nice dram, a solid 80 over a 100. Cheers!"

3.0,"Dark caramel is the color in this Tennessee Whiskey and thin very oily legs find their way back down the glass.

The nose is generally sweet with notes of maple and vanilla, melted butter on toast, banana bread, and an unsweet slight nail polish note to keep things interesting.

The palate has a really watery mouthfeel with notes of barrel or BBQ char, salted peanuts, rye bread, barrel spice, and cherry.

The finish is spicy, smoky, and lingering.

I’m glad I got to try this expression from the Jack Daniel’s lineup. With the higher ABV than the Old No. 7, it has a bit more spice and punch, which I like. It isn’t a phenomenal whiskey, but it’s good. If you come across it and are craving some Jack, I say go for it! Thanks, Jack! Cheers!"

4.25,"Heavy Butter and Vanilla notes, also kinda spicy, on the tongue. Smoky on the finish. This is a nice drink and a great addition to Jack Daniels portfolio."
