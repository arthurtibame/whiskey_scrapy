4.75,"The color is bright gold and gently coats the glass as it gives off a nose of barley, citrus, honeyed nuts and creamy cereal. Sweet barely coats the mouth for a rich mouthfeel, followed by intense black pepper which is balanced by citrus, creamy cereal and a hint it nuttiness. The pepper is tamed as the whiskey breathes, and it enjoys a long finish full of barely and pepper with a pleasant creaminess underneath. Bold and excellent."
