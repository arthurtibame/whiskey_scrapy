Harsh on the taste. Long finish. The wine/sherry is muted initially but helps the finish. It lingers in a good way. Much improved with a few drops of water.

3.0,"It's fine, but doesn't stand up to the hype for me.  i get a lot of ethanol smell from the glass (actually smelled better from the bottle then in the glass). Initial taste is decently smooth oak and burnt sugar. Then it gets decently hot and for a while the alcohol overpowers the flavors. Once the burn calms down I get left with a decent leftover.  All said and done it isn't bad and good for sharing a dram with friends, but the middle isn't doing this any favors in my book."
3.75,"Nose... Definitely Bourbon forward, sweet cherries, tree bark, warm pecan pie and a bit of vanilla, almost donut like... The wine and Sherry come early just lightly..

Appearance...a light to medium copper...

Taste... Initially the wine and Sherry influence is there, followed by a corn rich bourbon note, mint, peanuts and pepper...

Overall... For the price point of $34usd, it's a definite must try and even to buy a bottle of. As far as the overall complexity that I was hoping for in a Sherry influenced bourbon it just didn't meet it. If it somehow managed to pull the Sherry more so it would have been remarkable. As far as the bourbon is concerned it's solid, but I know other Sherry types that meet my expectations more so than Legent has so far.... Maybe Cask it next time?"

4.5,"@Richard-ModernDrinking and I shared a few drams last night.  This was one opened by Richard.  This is a first of its kind using Japanese blending skill with American bourbon.  Blend of bourbon, sherry cask bourbon, and wine cask bourbon.  If you haven’t bought this yet...do so.  It’s only $35...and you won’t go wrong.  Not your typical bourbon, more a whiskey drinker’s.  Not overly sweet, but rather layers of complexity from the different blends.  This rounded up my top 6 ( preceded by the belle of the night Macallan 10 from the 80s, Ardbeg Drum CE, Stranger & stranger , NY Blend, and the beauty from Sweden Smogen).  Thanks Richard for sharing!"
3.75,"Wanted to give this a try, ventured to ABC to look for it, and it just so happened that they got it in stock today. It was meant to be.


Nose: It’s complex. It feels like I get something different each time. Black cherries, bread, chocolate and some citrus...plus some typical bourbon notes (brown sugar, a little vanilla and caramel). The missus said it smelled like Black Forest Cake. 

Taste: Less complex, but still a good deal going on. And it’s cohesive. Berries and grapes  up front (probably the wine-barrel influence), then you get a sugary cola. Then fluffy bread. Classic Jim Beam peanuts finishes the ride. Definitely a PB&J vibe. Decent finish.

Overall: A very unique offering. Fun. I’m happy I purchased the bottle, a fair price at $35. I’m not sure it’s something I’ll always keep in stock, but I’m happy to have it in my collection for when I want something different.

I think it’s encouraging that a big whiskey company is experimenting, and I hope others do so as well"

Definitely has the classic Beam nuttiness that you’ll find across the whole portfolio.  

If anyone has had Little Book I definitely notice some similarities. 

While that one is a kick in the teeth, this is quite a bit more refined.  

The sherry influence is really enjoyable, though it’s right up to the line without going over it. 

Not sure I’d go out of my way to buy it again, but it’s an interesting one to keep around."

3.75,"Solid middle of the road tasting for me. I felt that my bottle was so overwhelmed by an almost tart alcohol flavor as soon as it hits my palate that I struggled to really appreciate the other notes. 

I agree with other tasters that this was a unique buy. If you taste it, you'll know it is Legent in your glass. However, I believe that this bottle will be sitting a loonnnggg time and will most likely be my last. 

EDIT: Still not my favorite, but after letting it sit for a week and having a couple more drams this one has grown on me substantially. It seems that the tart, almost medicinal flavor mellowed out quite well. Will update if I do buy another bottle by the time I finish it."

4.25,"Taste:  1 oz. neat in glen cairn at room temp. then 2 drops water.  

Nose: (4)  Initially out of the bottle I couldn't find a discernable nose.  Takes a little coaxing and some air but patience pays dividends as after 5 mins. it blooms.  You inhale grape jam, peanuts, and honeysuckle.  Really good balance between sweet and floral.  

Palate: (4) Rich and creamy.  The peanuts even out to a peanut brittle.  The ""jaminess"" is still there and pepper kicks in on the back palate.  The pepper was unexpected as the nose and initial taste give no hint of the back end.  As quick as it comes is as fast as it leaves.  A decent flavor pop.

Finish: (4.25)  Finish stood out for me.  As delicate as this whisky initially smells and upon its initial palate is as rugged as the finish is.  The finish is all Beam.

Overall:  Pleasant surprise to me.  I am not in the know on Japanese whisky and the whole blending thing made me a skeptic, but if this is the wave of the future, I say thumbs up!  Five stars for interesting as this one is a bit of chameleon so I bumped the overall to 4.25.  Starts out gentle, kicks you in the taste buds like a Bookers albeit at much lower proof, but remains sophisticated.  I like it. Good pick"

4.0,"It’s been quite some time since I have done a review. Work and play with a head cold has prevented a concentrated amount of time.  But tonight the tasting stars aligned. This is one I have been hearing some good things about. On sale locally, a snagged a bottle and looked forward to tasting.
 
Out of the gate, it’s fruity; grape jam, like Welch’s Grape Jam.  Time is much needed to draw out the additional notes as it’s light in initial aromas. Peanut brittle, oranges, almond extract, vanilla work their way through. There a touch of red wine like a Cabernet or Merlot that keeps the grape notes ever present. 

The arrival is a fruity, sweet, spicy and rich in a dense, creamy, silky body.  Plumbs, strawberries with butterscotch, creme brûlée. Ground Cinnamon  provides a mild kick mingled with oak spice.  Charcoal/barrel char is present and adds the flavor characteristics in a positive way. An almond or walnut nutty quality gently weaves itself within the fruity spiciness.

Water is definitely not needed and expectedly dilutes the fullness of the flavors. 

A subtle woody dryness with the plumby, jammy and orange fruit carry over from the palate; a seamless segue to the finish.  The cinnamon tingle stays for a long time and provides a warming sensation deep down. 

This is full of energy and vibrance.  A fruit bowl with some sweetness and a pinch of spice.  An extremely easy sipper.  Though there is some weight behind this one at 47%, it feels like sipping at 43% or 40%.  There is a noticeable Japanese style silkiness to the bourbon and the is a Booker’s baseline quality and flavoring is forefront. The fruitiness is not overblown and balanced, slightly to the side of fruit.  Well blended.  A enjoyable sweeter sipper that will not disappoint, especially at $30 a bottle.  This experiment of East meets west (Suntory/Jim Beam) has proved itself with positive results. [$30][90/100][Tasted: 4/20/19]"

3.75,"Neat.  Nose is all over the place.  Initially hit with buttery corn and then the sherry influence takes over.  Vanilla.  Baking spice.  Very smooth mouth feel, sherry influence dominates again.  Lots of spice and pepper, unexpectedly.  Sherry legs for miles.  Get more oak as I return to the nose.

I am all over the place on it.  I find it interesting, I keep drinking it, keep finding different flavors. But I don’t actually like it.  I don’t want another glass right now."

3.5,"My initial nose on this was your typical bourbon nose (sweet caramel, oak forward, and a bit of ethanol). Not impressed in the least; That is, until my 2nd pour! I nosed sweet, creamy caramel right upfront, alongside vanilla. Then I began to pick up fruits, like tart plums, green grapes, and melon? 🤷🏽‍♀️ On the palate, I got candied walnuts almost IMMEDIATELY! The caramels, brown sugars, and vanilla were also present; with a slight bite of spice. Viscous, and lightly mouth-coating. The finish was rather short; which I’m not a fan of, but  I did get the oak wood, barrel char, and a VERY faint honeydew melon. 

I’m gonna let the bottle sit for a while to really open up, and give an updated review. All in all, I’d HIGHLY RECOMMEND this bourbon. Good Job, Noe and Fukuyo! 👍🏽

UPDATE!!!! - So, I let the bottle sit for a week to allow the bourbon to open up. To me, it increased in sweetness (which I love!), but it also became more astringent. To summarize this review, Legent is a decent bourbon, for both price and for giving us a partial 3-in-1! I was expecting a bolder impact from the sherry and wine casks, but I would recommend it, and put it in the top 10 of beginner bourbons."

3.0,"Did a proper tasting with the glencairn glass for this one as I was excited to try this dram out.

The nose on this was a pretty classic bourbon with a little more of the baking spices popping through. After a few whiffs the nose seems to calm and opens into light berries with spices.

The first sip was a little spicier than I expected for a finished whiskey but it let me know that it was there which was a pleasant surprise. Still it was a good first sip that had some kick at the short finish. 

The second sip was what I was looking forward to as my palette was becoming accustomed to the juice. The first thing I got was brown sugar with caramel followed by jelly/jam, but not too sweet. After the sweet notes the baking spices showed up a little with a peppery and short finish. 

It is a good bourbon and I would recommend anyone to try it but I do not believe I will be going out of my way to purchase another bottle. I liked the juice just was hoping for a longer finish for a bottle of this pricing. Go out and try it still!"

3.0,"A nice enough Bourbon, wine cask finished for some added sweetness."
2.75,"The over-hyped, glossy packaging and tepid “remarks” of the creators in the ad campaign really illustrate the “shotgun wedding” that is Beam-Suntory.  Congrats on taking the Beam mashbill and making it taste like a soft, unfocused Japanese whiskey. Did they really need to create the “first new brand” in umpteen years to do that.?  The packaging is sexy, the marketing is sexy, and the story tries to be compelling. In the end, though, this comes across as forced—contrived, even. I searched for weeks to find this, only to discover that, over a month of tasting and re-tasting, I just don’t get much from this. It’s not offensive, or even badly made and blended. It’s just not exciting and doesn’t live up to its considerable, if ad agency conceived hype."

4.25,This is a GREAT sub-$50 bottle.  There's an undercurrent of juicy citrus beneath the classic bourbon flavors.  A splash of dry wine beneath the sweet and creamy creme brulee notes.  Bright and fun.  Almost makes you want to take a big sip as opposed to pecking at it.

Mmm, hitting me right tonight.  Maybe this opened up because this is a different experience to me.  The flavors on the taste runs the exact reverse of the nose.  Preserves and vanilla blast and they Give way to the nuttiness.  Legs are a red velvet and last a decent length for a 94 proof.

Finish - That French vanilla turns into a leatherish but man cologne that stays and just sits for some time.

Overall - the price and the experience is worth the mean of how much it's worth that richness it's a good pick up cheers."

3.5,"Big thanks to @Scott_E for generously providing me with this sample. This is one I have been itching to try ever since it's release and up until now I have yet to see it in the AZ market, so I am excited to have this opportunity to sample it. On to the tasting!
Right upon entry you are hit with classic Bourbon barrel char notes of toffee and brown sugar that play against cherry and Sherry notes. It a really pleasant combination that keeps it from being too sweet. On the mid palette black pepper and a slight campfire smoke is introduced leading to a medium grape, Sherry and dry oak finish. The finish is a bit drying.
You really have to applaud Beam and Suntory for what they have done here in providing a unique, affordable and enjoyable addition to the Bourbon market. At $35 it's a solid dram. It won't blow you away. It's doesn't really punch much above it's weight, but the way it's priced it's a worthy addition to any Whiskey lovers cabinet. 
I for one will buy a bottle when it finally makes it to AZ! 
Thanks again @Scott_E and cheers all!"
3.0,A lot of wine flavor in this bourbon and very Sweet. I’m not a fan.
3.75,"Nose; crisp florals, lilac, sandelwood, faint warm spices and sugars.

Palate: barrel oak, mild vanilla- caramel sweetness, considerably dryer than some of the high proof Beam lineup, hints of red fruitiness and plum jam(the sherry finish most likely). 

Finish: smooth, sweet,  small tannins and more woods with little heat invites repeat sips. 

Overall this seems like a really balanced product which is not surprising given the Suntori influence on the finishing stages and the care in quality is evident as well.   The Fred Noe bourbon at the base brings the expected results yet somehow the overall blend doesn't quite live up to the promise of the nose and otherwise expectation of this hybrid whiskey heritage.  

This is a great bourbon to share and will no doubt yield a myriad of opinions, but isn't likely to knock anyones favorite off the top of their list.   If the pricepoint holds up it will be an easy addition for the home bar as a worthy conversational drinker."

3.75,"Wine comes right on the nose. Taste of caramel, cherries, and wine. Smooth long finish."
3.75,"I rarely drink bourbon, let along buy a bottle, but the Japanese angle was intriguing enough to justify a $40 gamble. The wine and sherry casks do a good job of tempering the creamy bourbon flavors that don’t normally appeal to me, especially so on the nose, where the sugary vanilla and pleasantly sour berries blend together well in harmonious layers. In the mouth the flavors appear in sequence: creamy at first (a bit too cloying for me, like artificially sweetened ice cream), fruity and spicy on the palate, and dry on the long finish. The cream reappears at the very end, the sweetness tempered by an undertone of dry wine notes. It’s an interesting experiment and I don’t begrudge the purchase, especially given the handsome bottle, but it’s not the bourbon that is going to lure me away from House Barley given the overall dominance of the vanilla flavors and the lack of integration on the palate. If you’re an adventurous lover of the corn spirit, however, I wager you’ll enjoy this a lot."

4.0,"I put off trying this for a while based on the reviews. But I was pleasantly surprised when I finally got my hands on a bottle. It has that classic Beam nuttiness, but the fruitiness from the finishing complements the flavor greatly. For $35, this is a great new product in the Jim Beam line. Much better than standard White Label, but lacks the oakiness I love from the Knob Creek Single Barrel for $15 more. I may not always keep this on my shelf, but it's an exciting change in what I've come to expect from the distillery. Recommended."

3.5,"Initial nose was typical Jim Beam. After sitting for 10 minutes it revealed hibiscus flower, honey, cloves, spicy rye and peanut shells. The palate is smooth, mild caramel. The finish is medium length a little spicy with a slight bitterness."
3.75,"Nose - Oaky vanilla, toasted orange peel, strawberries, caramel, subtle peanut, kind of muted nose

Taste - Bit dry, light oaky bitter, fruity caramel, light orange peel with pith bitterness, cinnamon heat, peanut funk emerges late

Finish - Light cinnamon heat, light honey roasted peanut butter sweet, peanut skin bitter, fruity grape skin tannic

Score - 80/100

Final Thoughts - So this one started out with a fairly muted nose & that was a bit disappointing. Sadly this one tastes exactly as I expected it to being a Jim Beam distillate, which was a slightly fruity/tannic Jim Beam. It has a classic Beam peanut-funk backbone with hints of fruit & tannins from the red wine & sherry cask finishes. It's a nice change from standard Beam but isn't really anything spectacular. I wouldn't mind sipping this neat or mixing it into a more fruity Old Fashioned or making a ""PB&J"" Old Fashioned by maybe adding some creme de cassis or something to it.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - Probably not another"

3.75,"Nose hits you with some berry compote, caramel, oak, and a welcome hint of the Beam peanut funk. 

On to the palate we get some chewy bourbon flavors of burnt caramel, almond butter, raisin, and honey. 

Finish is pretty damn long and very very dry with tannic oak, dried cherry, tea leaves, and a hint of mint. Buttery mouthfeel. 

Overall, something about this leaves me a little underwhelmed. While I know it was blended by ""master blenders"" and all, but something about the marriage doesn’t work for me; the dryness and tannic bitterness of the finish are a little overboard. It's not bad by any means but I'd probably reach for something else given the choice. If there was a ""3.65"" rating that's what this would get but seeing as there isn't I will reluctantly round up."
3.0,"Nose: Cinnamon spice, clove, and orange zest are the most apparent notes initial.  The spice turns into a bit of an ethanol burn.  After that fades, it's like a stodgy fruitcake.  It's hard to find much more behind the alcohol.

Palate:  Sweet, cool, and thick!  There's a burst of icing sweetness followed by cinnamon, clove, orange, and oatmeal raisin cookies.  Lurking in the back is some rye spice and a small bit of oak.

Finish:  Medium length.  That oatmeal raisin note sticks around for quite a while.  Some cinnamon and vanilla float in every now and then.

Water opens up more warming spices, a small bit of cherry, oak, and vanilla on the nose - and gets rid of much of the ethanol burn.  The mouthfeel is much bigger with some water, and there's a bit more of a burn.  There's also much more rye spice, some red hots, earthy sawdust, leather and vanilla now.  That oatmeal raisin cookie still dominates the finish, but is joined by much more oak and corn.

Conclusion:  At first, I was pretty disappointed by the nose on this - almost everything was hidden underneath a hot layer of ethanol.  The taste on the other hand was an explosion of flavor in comparison.  I don't know if I've ever found such a distinct oatmeal raisin cookie flavor in a bourbon before, but I'm a fan.  All-in-all it was fun to buy, but I don't think I'd buy a bottle."

4.5,"I'm a huge fan of the Jim Beam Small Batch collection. Needless to say, I was excited to see new blood in the lineup. Not to mention, the folks from Suntory apparently had some influence in this one. Should be a good one.

Nose: Unlike any bourbon I've had before. If it weren't for the heavy dusty corn note, I'd say it was reminiscent of a single malt scotch. Raisins, fig, date, dried red fruits,  and a touch of later bear credence to the wine/sherry cask finishing. There is also caramel, gala apple, maple, toffee, crumb cake, peanut brittle, roasted nuts, toasted almond, and oak. Even mango, which is a first for me. Awesome.

Palate: Sweet and jammy. Specifically strawberry jam. I also get raspberry, cherry, and plum, along with more of the raisin, fig, and date. Some honey, vanilla, caramel, and brown sugar to remind me that this is in fact a bourbon. Some leather, baking spice, and more of those nutty and oaky notes. Very nice.

Finish: Moderate-to-short in length. Red fruit from the wine/sherry influence. Raspberry, cherry, apple. A nice touch caramel, baking spice, and oak. You can hardly tell that this clocks in at 47% ABV. Not as exciting as the palate or the nose, but it does nothing to detract from a great experience.

Another winner for the Beam SB series, and a superb first output from the Beam-Suntory as collaboration. It hits all the marks. It's completely unique, soundly executed, and a great value for your dollar. I paid $40 for this and I feel like I made off like a bandit.

Hopefully this is the beginning of a great new partnership between two formidable distillers. Business and politics aside, I think this proves that a cross-pollination of whiskey culture and craftsmanship can yield amazing results. Often times, when ownership of a distillery changes hands, the quality tanks. However, the quality of the existing Beam lineup has remained in tact; and now, we have this gem. Buy with confidence. Impressive stuff."

3.0,"Aroma: Mainly caramel, cherries, and peaches. Also smelling some different types of chocolate, along with vanilla, raisins, figs, grapes, apple. and roasted nuts. Needless to say, it smells pretty sweet. Oak seems somewhat underwhelming.

Taste: Taste is quite sweet, tastes like a jam or some sort of fruit spread. I'm tasting grapes, raisins, figs, dates, plums, cherries, and brown sugar for the sweet part. Along with the vanilla, oak, and leather.

Finish: Somewhat short to moderate finish. Can really taste the sherry effect that they were going for with all those fruits, and sort of transitions to roasted almonds and other nuts. Little to no burn.

Overall, it's somewhat perfumey and sweeter than it needs to be. Those sweet flavors seem to overwhelm the oak and other more subdued notes, however it is an okay bourbon with its very unique take."

3.25,"Was really looking forward to this after reading reviews. Nose is old cardboard soaked in sherry, barrel notes and a resemblance to Beam Black. Palate is..........well lets stop screwin around....... it tastes like a sherry finished Beam Black. Fruity wine notes merged with the standard JBB profile(see JBB review). Finish is a bit drying and oaky with some of the tannic sherry taking over. Your level of enjoyment will come down to: do you like Beam Black...sherry finished bourbon?.....well I do get along with both so its a nice dram imo. Here's the problem. Paid $36 for this.... I can get JBB for under $20 all day and skip the sherry finish and be a happy clam. As much as I liked this I have to pass only due to cost. Still for what it is its well executed and I do actually like it so 83/100.....pull this under $30 and Im in...........yes I really like to use""........"""

3.5,"Great dark color, but not enough to think it's artificial or from anything other than charred oak. The scent from a distance is nutty and light, but strong toasted oak and jammy wine flavors come alive when nosing the glass. The proof seems perfect for this application, since the blending of wine, bourbon, and sherry all have a corner to the palate here. A classic, middle-aged bourbon is the first thing to taste, then deep, dried fruit notes, likely from the wine, have a slight impact on the middle. The finish is clearly nutty and where the sherry comes in. A few minutes after the last sip, more and more toasted and even raw oak are easily tasted, smoothing out the finish for quite a while. As daring and odd as the Noe brothers have been lately, this is actually a great addition, with a really good price point."
