4.0,Much like the 12 in character but with significantly more punch. Still light on the tongue and not too much to take in but a lot more substantial. The iodine notes stuck out as the most distinguishing flavour.

4.0,"Orchard fruit, watermelon and orange rind on the nose. Good mouthful, with delicious combination of honey, dried apricots, and fresh berries on the palate. Gentle oak spice from warm and medium length finish. Fragrant, balanced and very enjoyable dram."

2.0,"Let me just start off by noting that three of the previous seven notes written by people for this bottling are actually for the 18-year-old, which means the user rating average here is inaccurate. That said, I gave the 18-year-old three stars, and I have in general never enjoyed Aberfeldy whiskies. This one is no exception. In fact it's outright bad, which to my defense isn't a prejudice against this distillery since every single Aberfeldy I've ever tried with the exception of the 12 was by blind tasting. This 16-year-old is just not good! It started off well, with the nose having pleasant hints of citrus, oak and honeycomb. The mouth and finish though... the devil distilled this."

3.5,"Aberfeldy was my first ever purchased single malt brand. While I prefer peated drams nowadays, the 12 year old was a huge step up from the cheaper blends I tasted before.

At a dinner with friends, I noticed the restaurant served this Aberfeldy 16 as it's premium whisky choice. While I'm accustomed to it's 12 years old variant, I never had a taste of this older sibling.

As far as my memory goes, the nose it pretty similar to the Aberfeldy 12 and reveals hits of apples, raisins, and more prominently, some caramel.

The palate is full, round bodied and adds some more apple, but also some not-too-sweet honey. The Oloroso influences are noticeable, but not too apparent.
The finish is rather moderate, and adds a slight - but pleasant - oakyness.

While not peated, I still love Aberfeldy. I feel it's sometimes a bit underrated, but in my opinion it's price-quality is top notch. 
This 16 year old was definitely a perfect dram on a great evening with friends!"

null,"July 24th, 2018 at Darby’s Gastown in Vancouver. A sweet and candied nose, maybe a trace of smoke, mostly fruit and vanilla. Eminently pleasant, but not overly complex. Time for a sip. Hmm..sweet and fruity. A damnably nice whiskey, but this guy has gone to the smoke and peat side, from which there is no return."

4.0,"Light, sweet, less peaty. smooth and fine finish,"
2.75,"Nose: Very light honey, pollen, beeswax, cereal. A hint of weak orange herbal tisane and a little background oak as it opens.

Palate: The palate is very much the same as the nose. Sweet and soft on the arrival, which is mostly mildly spiced honey and light malt. Nothing new emerges in the development - the spicy, dry mead-like character expands briefly then subsides into the finish. The texture has a dilute creamy nature, but the honey tones are crisp.

Finish: Short. The palate just fades away until suddenly ... it disappears without trace.

A soft, slightly sweet malt that is very easy to drink. It's certainly well made and there are no off notes anywhere, but it lacks complexity and the finish is stunningly short. You certainly don't need water either - it tastes weak and I cannot help but wonder how delightful this profile could be at 46%.

If you are an experienced whisky drinker or prefer assertive whiskies then give this a miss. If you are just starting out and want something ultra-friendly and unchallenging it might be suitable, but at the asking price of AUS$135 I would not recommend it. You're better off with Aberfeldy 12 which is a better dram at almost half the price.

""Average"" : 2.75 stars"
4.5,"Oaky tobacco, fruity. You can taste the sherry cask"
4.0,"Fresh, sweet nose, almost like red licorice, quite pleasant. Easy tasting, a little oaky with a hint of vanilla, really smooth. A light fruity finish, though it disappears fairly quickly. A nice before dinner sipper."
