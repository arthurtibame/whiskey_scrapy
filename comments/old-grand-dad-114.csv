4.25,"Aroma slightly overpowered by alcohol but has floral and vanilla undertones. 
Taste begins soft with slight alcohol rasp vanilla and caramel undertones kicked with an alcohol rasp and nice warmth in the chest."

3.75,"Solid pour for the price!

Background: 
I often buy a budget bourbon and leave it at my girlfriend’s house. That way, if I’m feeling a dram, I have something nearby. My girlfriend, also, likes whiskey and will make a hot toddy for a nightcap. 
So I look for versatile, tasty bourbons that won’t break the bank...

Here’s the short version: Hot hot hot!Just expect OGD114 to give you a nice big, spicy ethanol hug.

Once acclimated, I get honeyed sweetness, citrus, vanilla, caramel, and spice on the nose. 

On the taste, it’s hot and spicy! Cinnamon, cloves, hay, and mint. The rye is very apparent in this whiskey. There’s a underlying hint of citrus there too. At the end, I get that bit of nuttiness that’s common in Beam products.

Overall: 
This is a solid budget pick. My bourbon preferences tend to lean towards high rye bourbons. I like that spice! It’s a decent pour and will hold it’s own as a mixer. Will it unseat my current budget bourbon: Wild Turkey 101? No...but it’s a good and wallet friendly! This is a 3.5 for me but gets extra points for the price."

Taste: Wood, cherry, chocolate, peanuts, maple syrup.

2.0,"Got this bottle because of all of the hype it was getting and being a great “deal”. Personally I just don’t get it, not a fan. Had an off putting taste that I can’t seem to describe but was always there.
This is the third time trying it because I was hoping my taste buds were off but still a no go for me. A permanent mixer from now on and I will not buy again."

Taste - rye spice, cinnamon, peanuts, caramel, vanilla, black pepper, allspice, black tea, moderate ethanol burn (less than expected given the proof).

This was better than I anticipated. I found it pleasantly complex and a great value for the price."

2.0,"So I was cooked earlier and I've discovered any smoke can really ruin a bourbon nose so I'm going off my last pour for nosing. It's caramel, nutty, sweet...more sweet than your knob creeks or bookers.

Taste - thankfully no issue on flavor for me here. It's nutty, bready, caramel, slight red fruits. Mouth feel is rich enough but not the super oily. 

So it's nice sipping whisky. I don't get any off flavor profile elements and that's really impressive with this being a 30 dollar higher proof offering. 

Heck 2.0 for me, a very high score but I can't find anything off here. I also don't really get anything special. It's a very basic sweet beam product but clean and refined in a way."

3.0,"Not bad, not great. Solid for the price. Pretty heavy oak flavors from what I remember? Not at all smooth, but a good pour."

4.75,"Nice mouthfeel before a delayed burn afterward. Heat lingers as well. I can’t distinguish many flavors in this one, but each sip seems to be its own experience. 
After trying this more, the rating went up. One of my new favorites!"
3.25,"The nose is a huge fiery burn of gasoline and rubbing alcohol. Singes those nose hairs. It's called 114 for a reason. Straight up, all other aromas fade to the background, although some corn and a little potpourri comes out. If you pour a drop of water in there, the burn only slightly subsides, but the spices emerge. 

The first taste is just a burn, pure and simple. As it mellows, cinnamon and dusty brown sugar come out. It's a good combo of sweet and spicy. There are autumnal spices like nutmeg, and cinnamon powder. If you add a droplet, some tobacco, leather and vanilla bust out. 

The finish is hot, as expected; the burn stays on the lips. Dry Cinnamon powder, nutmeg, dried leaves. Mellows off into a toffee and cut tobacco. This is a deceptively complex whiskey that rewards you for spending time with it."

4.0,"I've had this at bars and liked it a lot, but never purchased a bottle until recently. I'm clueless as to why since this is arguably the best value bourbon on the market.

My prior experience has been with rocks glasses only, and as a result the nose is much more interesting in a Glencairn. I smell some brown sugar, citrus peel, and cinnamon/nutmeg spice, not sure if it's more rye or oak age influence. What I did not get in a rocks glass is the dominant tea note. This is unlike most bourbons I've had (most similar to Four Roses Small Batch Select). I would equate this to a medium oxidized tea, something like oolong. Think of a dark green tea or light black tea if you haven't had oolong. It is unlike other high rye bourbons and barely legal ryes I've had recently.

I get more ethanol and spice on the tongue, which is expected at 114 proof. The spice lingers, medium to long finish that ends tannic. Overall it is an incredibly tasty and smooth bourbon for the price and proof. When you think about what's available for around $30, there are few options out there that comparable. When I finish this I'm buying another because it's going to be a staple on my shelf for cocktails and neat pours."

4.25,Drank Old Grand-dad with my old granddads. Nothing better.
4.0,Nice spice with a smooth butterscotch and vanilla taste.
4.0,"Neat.  Neck pour.  Nuttiness and ethanol hit me first on the nose.  Some vanilla and mint.  Decent amount of cherry, I love finding cherry.  Baking spices.  Cinnamon.

Taste is a good translation of the nose.  Nice, creamy mouth feel.  Vanilla sweetness hits first, transitions to the cinnamon, cherry and leaves you with the nuttiness.

I would put this blind against Bakers.  I think it would hold its own.  There is a bit of ethanol that may hold it back from competing with Bakers and that makes sense too.  That is probably why it is where it is in price in the vertical.  A very very solid $30 bottle."

Not a very complex bourbon to me - originall picked up a lot of oak but it’s calmed since bottles been open. Liked it better with some water to bring down heat."
