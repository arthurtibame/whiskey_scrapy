3.75,A very smooth whisky with fruits on the nose.  The palate is pleasant with little to no burn.  The finish disappears quickly.
4.0,A solid Irish. Short but delightful finish that lingers a little more in the front.
3.75,"Banana on the nose, a little nose burn but delicate, getting some creaminess/ vanilla/ orange zest on the pallet, waxy drawn out finish that drys your tongue"

4.0,"Enjoyed at Irv's Pub, Hershey, PA. This one surprised me... Fresh crisp pears and bright apple cider, clove, ginger, and a hint of smoke in the nose. Full mouth-watering palate with sharp apple and orange marmalade leading into a wash of allspice, very little burn. Smooth and simple zesty, malty finish. Dry Glass: malt and a sweet sea breeze! Will definitely explore more of this distiller..."

3.0,"Amazing—and definitely Irish—nose with floral character, heather, and minerals. It lacks elsewhere though. A bit thin on the palate, and an overly fruity aftertaste. From tasting event, 12/17/16."

3.0,"It isn't the first time where I have found an Irish whisky that I heard hyped up in all the cavistes ""You'll like this"" ""You must try this"" ""It's amazing"" and then I try it... and I am greeted with a faint, quiet, discreet flavour. I expect a vibrant orchestra and instead I hear an old man shouting quietly through a cave. Maybe this whisky is nice... But I just can't taste it (and no I don't smoke and I have a very good palate)."

3.0,"It is the last ""chilly, but not super cold"" night in the forecast here for a while. My Advent calendar, now in the home stretch, served up this little treat...and it is a good companion for a cold, but not bitterly cold, night. The usual Irishman suspects are to be found - namely, a fruit basket's worth of flavors and aromas, woody spice (and definitely woody - there's enough barrel char present to make that clear), a honey-like viscosity, a little hint of vanilla. It's not complex, and I wish the finish lingered around for longer (much like perfect early winter nights), but this is a respectable workhorse of a dram worthy of my ancestors' name. If nothing else, it'll take the chill right out of your bones when you've just had to walk the garbage down to the end of your 1/8 mile driveway..."

3.5,"Quite light on the nose. Vanilla and caramel sweetness. Orchard fruits. 
On the palate I did not get too much fruityness (for me this is true for all expressions from this distillery that I tried so far). First sweetness  then warming spices. Some cocoa just before swallow.
The finish is long with some dryness and nutty flavours.
With water: on palate it is getting too light, aftertaste disappears."

4.75,"This is an absolutely wonderful single malt whiskey that I am so glad that I bought. It is one of the best Irish whiskeys of any type I have ever had the pleasure to drink. It has a deeper flavor than any other Irish whiskey I have had to date. It has a sweet fruity nose and initial taste of vanilla which smooths out to a nutty mid-taste and a hint of wood at the end. This is a really nice drink. I have had this neat and on the rocks and I would not mix this with anything ever. Don't Do It. ( Actually do what you want it is your bottle) I can't say enough good about this whiskey it is what I imagine great whiskey is supposed to be. And on a personal note, this is a solemn whiskey for me I opened my bottle with an Army buddy of mine the day he had to put his Airedale Terrier Luc down and we drank about half the bottle just talking about life and the way dogs make life better. Enjoy."
2.5,"The aroma is apples, as is the initial taste. Definite burn and I can’t place the aftertaste.
Adding water brings out a sweetness.

Definitely won’t be buying this."

4.25,"This is a very good single malt Irish whisky. Proof66 claims it to be 10 years of age. Perhaps it use to be. No where on the bottle or their web site do they claim that age currently. That aside, this is very tasty. Neat, there is smooth malt and a slight hint of sherry finish from a few barrels that add a subtle depth and richness to this dram. I found my bottles on sale for $35, that is a very good deal for this Irish malt. If you are forced to to pay $50-55 for this, I think there are better buys. None-the-less, this is very tasty and smooth. I will repurchase when the price is right."
