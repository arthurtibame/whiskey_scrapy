I tried this just for the uniqueness factor---it's only available here at the distillery.  Between this and the 14 year old Light Whiskey, this was far less complex.  It tasted younger than it's claimed 3 years.  Sweet sugary smell on the nose.  Taste is a bit sharp and astringent.  I needed water to smooth it out.  This was priced at $40."

2.0,I really want to like this one. Just can’t seem to get around the awkward flavor profile.

3.5,"Batch 2 has a nose that is sweet with oats, ripe apples, fresh sweet bread, touches of brown sugar and cherry with a bit of apple cider vinegar. The palate is rich with yeasted sweet bread as the apple cider vinegar coats the mouth with some astringency as burnt sugar and floral notes come behind. The finish is long with astringent ripe green apple keeping the mouth tingling as the sweet notes fade."

3.25,"Nose: similar grain smell one you get past the ethanol you can pick up fruit maybe like taffy the tasting notes at the distillery specifically highlighted pineapple but its faint and I dont get it every smell
Palate: tastes like grains like stale cheerios
Finish: grain gives way to light oak but it's super light"

3.75,"My first wheat whiskey. Tons of vanilla and caramel on the nose, like caramel butterscotch monkey bread. Palate is sweet and round with a bit of dust. It's not complex or evolving, but my golly does it taste good!"
