3.5,"I can't remember if I've had moonshine or not. When I lived in Ireland we used to go out to the country to visit relatives. An old relation used to brew his own poitin and gave me a bottle. In those days with a flat of 8 - 12 of us at any one time we drank just about anything but that was one thing at 70 - 80% or whatever strength it was that stopped us in our tracks. This is interesting... there is a lot to dislike about it, sweet and sour maltiness ...almost gin like quality but for some reason I keep drinking it. Really odd...I really don't know how much I could drink of this but I have a feeling it would turn into a crazy night if I tried!"
