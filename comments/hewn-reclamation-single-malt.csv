3.0,"Have a 325ml bottle of this.  It's interesting to say the least but there's no denying how young the spirit is.  It tastes overwhelmingly like an unaged spirit which in all honesty,  it kindof is.  It's a novel idea,  and the addition of different kinds of older woods does add some interesting notes to the spirit,  but it just doesn't have the complexity or smoothness of a patiently aged whiskey."
