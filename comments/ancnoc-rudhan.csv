4.5,Light peat. Sea wind. Good balance.
3.5,"As its a travel exclusive, and rather cheap, i didnt have much hope. But i gave this one a shot because i just love ancnoc 12. 

Nose: peaty, but not the medicinal/bandaid kind of peaty that you'll often find in islay scotch. More like a seaside wind, with seaweed and shellfish. There is a fruityness behind the peat with citrus and some tropical fruit notes. vanilla is certainly there. also some green apple.
Taste: This is a 3-stage experience. 1: sweetness with some apple, grass, and citrus. 2: there is the peat! a slight burn here makes me think this wkisky is kind of young. 3: this develops into nutty flavors with caramel and vanilla. 
Finish: mostly caramel, vanilla and a bit of coffee. It is medium long and doesn't disappoint."
3.0,"Smokey, some bite and a lingering finish"

4.0,"Nose is peaty but also some sweetness, ripe banana, ginger, green apples. On the palate, more spicy, peppery, a little bit of lemon peel, campfire smoke. The smoke lingers, dry finish."
