3.0,"A pretty straightforward, vanilla-and-oak bourbon. Likably oily texture. Strongly reminiscent of Maker’s Mark’s basic expression."

4.25,No. 3 on the Whipper snapper tasting flight. Slightly older than lower strength sibling it was stronger on the wood tanins and nutmeg characteristics. There was something else there as well I couldn't pick. Water opened it up and softened the tanins. Another good effort. I ended up picking up a bottle of this and opened up later with the brother in law in Melbourne. I enjoyed it even more by itself. Very good example of the style
