3.0,"Another purchase from the November 2016 BCLC limited spirit release. Was hoping for something closer to The Macallan Amber given the deceptively rosey colour, but was a little disappointed. On the nose there was nowhere near the same tobacco scent as Macallan's other deeper coloured offerings. On the pallet only a hint of that Amber or Rare Cask fruitcake fullness. Would give it 3.5 stars if I could, and would think twice if I wanted to buy this again."

The Roca brothers were going for desert flavors when they picked these casks and they hit the mark. Note: ignore the Rare classification. There are 20,000 cases, so finding a bottle will be easy."

Nose: toffee,  chocolate, dried fruits and some caramel. 
Palate: warm, toffee, spicy vanilla, and a hint of smokiness. 
Finish: slow, medium viscosity, dry, slight burn. Nic complexity but not overly complex. Three drops of water will take care of the burn though. 
I think I will buy another one just to have one since it is an edition no 2 but not particularly because I am blown away by it."

Sultana raisins, figs and dried prunes coated with a touch of salt and sweet caramel really deliver on the bold flavours. And while the finish is much shorter than you would expect, considering the No. 2's confidence, you'll still have a hard time leaving disappointed."

5.0,"Luxury brand collaborations make me nervous, really nervous.  Too often, nothing good comes out of two luxury empires combining their prestige to sell a sub-standard product unworthy of both companies (see the Porsche, Aston Martin, Bentley, etc. crossovers with the mechanical wristwatch world).  Macallan's Edition series therefore made me a bit apprehensive when I heard the concept.  One of the finest scotch distilleries in the world, working with specialists from other disciplines (perfume, food), sounds promising to some, but I feared that the result would just be double the marketing and half the product quality.  Happily, Edition No. 2, which is a collaboration between Macallan and the Spanish chefs behind one of the world's most renowned restaurants (Celler de Can Roca), actually lives up to the hype.  The nose of this whisky is more captivating than Rare Cask, which is triple the price.  I'm brought back to the ice cream shop where I worked after senior year of high school, with caramel ice cream sandwiched between some graham crackers.  After a whiff or two, I'm also getting some chocolate syrup drizzled on top.  There is a pleasant, rich oak presence throughout the nose, which acts as a frame for this well-integrated and harmonious bouquet.  The sherry influence here doesn't produce the standard dark fruit flavors that one would expect, but instead exudes an alluring, almost bourbon-like richness.  The palate features some of the best balance in a sherried whisky I've experienced:  cherry syrup with a slightly medicinal tinge, complex fruit (some orange, some peach, some pear, some apple), and loads of aromatic wood and piquant wood spices.  The 5% ABV jump between the Rare Cask and this expression also produces better mouthfeel, as Edition No. 2 is thick and substantial.  The finish is not quite as long as I'd hope, so mark it down as this whisky's main flaw, but it's a good, creamy combination of sherry fruit, taro, and candied ginger.  Although I'm not the biggest fan of the distillery as a whole, this is the best Macallan I've tried.  This shows up online for under $100, where it is surprisingly good value, particularly relative to some of the stratospheric prices that Macallans can command."

I wanted to really love this. Edition #1 was great. Edition #3 is amazing. 

There is something with Edition #2 that my palate really hates. If I had to describe it, it’s almost an astringent-type taste. It’s really strong and I cannot get over it. 

I’ve had drams of this on 3 occasions now. Neat, with some water, with an ice cube... it doesn’t get rid of that sharp unpleasant taste I get from this.

On the palate, a surprisingly dry opening with mild oak. It’s smooth with light toasted notes abounding. The body carries medium weight and a deep amber color.

On the back end you’ll find dried nuts, walnut, water chestnut and a hint of salt that leaves you mouth salivating. It was a fun experience, but not one I’d go out of my way to own.

#13: Macallan Edition No. 2.  Single Malt Scotch.  48.2% ABV.  NAS.
Paid $110
I am replacing this bottle.  Sometimes you just have to accept that Macallan costs extra.  A really good limited edition Macallan for ~$100 is special.

The whole Macallan Editions have the slogan “Macallan creates,” and it is really more about engineering a good whisky for connoisseurs.  By using something like 7 casks, this whisky abandons all notions of traditional maturation.  Can it still present as a refined spirit?  Yes.  This is much better than the 12 year old sherry oak Macallan, and even better than the 12 year old Glendronach.  It’s still exclusively sherry, and it is sharp in all the right places.  A solid toffee, sultana, European oak (dry) base supports raspberries, vanilla, and sweeter American oak notes that jump out of the glass.  The finish is surprisingly spicy, but I wish it lasted longer.  I had thought this Edition No. 2 was the best of the three editions so far, but I recently opened a new bottle of Edition No. 1, and it was clearly better in a blind tasting.  The Edition No. 1 has not gone through enough testing to be on the countdown, however.  No. 2 is still a worthy whisky to be the first 90 rating on the countdown.

4.0,"Ah Macallan what are you doing to me. Once the whipping boy for over priced average drams (IMHO of the number I've tried) the last drop amber (for the price) was nice and reasonable and now this. Orange peel, toffee, honey, caramel, rich dark dry fruits and more on the nose and then onto the palate. At only $100 this is def VFM. It still has that hint of bitterness or astringency another reviewer mentioned which I get with Macallan a lot and a few drops of water weirdly made it worse but still great dram. I see ScotchHarding also noticed it and coined it bitter orange peel or maybe a combination of black and green pepper type thing he also mentioned. Weirdly I like bitter as I had a blood red grapefruit before hand but not in my whiskey. I started higher but in the end settled to a solid 4 or maybe even a 3.75 as it's really bugging me now I reckon."

It’s takes a luxury item like scotch and takes it to a whole new level of pricing for what it offers.  It’s like a Mercedes...you’re paying a premium for the name brand, and it doesn’t disappoint, but you can get 90% of the way there with a premium Japanese car like Acura.  Anyway...this one here is different.  For just about $100, it’s quite affordable in the scotch world.  And it’s actually on par for the price!  Nose is amazing.  Like a cross between dessert and perfume.  I’m not sure this was made for drinking but rather to smell!  Taste...so/so.  Not bad, but the aroma is the best part.  Well worth the price."

Score - 90/100

Final Thoughts - This is definitely more of the sherried Macallan profile I expect from a Macallan release. This was amazingly well balanced from start to finish and was just a very easy sipping sherried Macallan. No offputting notes or odd bitterness. Nice nose, not too complex, but nicely sherried. Overall quite delicious.

Would I buy a bottle? - Debating if I want to try & locate another but prices are going up."

5.0,"The quest to diversify my growing collection of whisky has continued as I finally broke down and bought my first bottle of Macallan. After hearing so many people complain they are not worth the money and not wanting to pay for their aggressive marketing campaign I stayed away as long as I could. 

I was a convert to scotch early this summer after drinking exclusively bourbon and beer for the past five years. My introduction to scotch was Lagavulin 16 so peaty whisky is what I consider my “home” and first love. Sweetness was something I associated with the corn from bourbon and was not something I had been looking for in this new found hobby of buying and tasting scotch. Holy hell have I been missing out.

The nose may have brought me to my knees had I smelled this for the first time while standing. Chocolate, vanilla, wood, berries, and honey. The shock came from just how sharp and in your face the scent hit me. It is the exact opposite of a Laphroaig/Ardbeg in regards to flavor/scent profile but I’ll be damned if the volume of this isn’t turned up to eleven as well. I think I smelled this for ten minutes before taking my first sip. The wood and vanilla really come across on the palate well. The sweetness is not as strong as the palate suggests but I did get pear and cinnamon on the finish. I would have guessed this was a 40-43 ABV but I appreciate the Macallan clocking in just over 48 ABV. 

I don’t know if I just got lucky with this bottle or if I am really loving strong sherry finished whiskys now (my only previous experience is the Glenfarclas 12 and 25). The store had nine more of this edition and I may pick up another bottle as reserve.

Any recommendations for sweeter drams are very welcome as I prepare for another trek to the store to see what else I may be missing out on.

4.5,"It’s time to chronicle my experiences with some of these new Macallan NAS series: Editions. They have released a bottle of this every year since 2015. They are all experimental batches trying different blenders, wood types, etc. Prices have remained consistent on the retail market- about $90-100 for each batch. The secondary market has gone absolutely bonkers over Edition No. 1, though- with prices approaching $1000 for a bottle now. The clear answer to that is “No”.

Let’s focus on the 2016 batch: Edition No. 2.  This batch was influenced by a restaurantuer family that lay claim to being named the World’s Best Restaurant on two separate occasions.  Damn.  The Roca family.  See the Edition No. 2 packaging for more info if that’s your thing.

This whisky is a deep, sunset copper and bronze  in the Glencairn.  It’s oily and makes some thin, quickly running legs.  It’s bottled at 48.2%.  I paid $99 for this bottle a year or so ago.

The nose is a rich, sherry bomb with a damp, funky and earthy wood note rounding things out.  Those carry the nose for as long as you’d care to just sit and sniff it.  There’s dried berries, orange wedges and zesty citrus if you really get down in there.  It’s a wonderful combo.

The palate grabs your attention quickly by blasting your tongue with some spicy ginger and black pepper.  The sherry steps in on cue to cut the burn and remind you this is still Macallan through and through.  It fades towards oranges and pears by mid sip before letting the back end grab your tastebuds again with strong oak and some vigorous abrasion.  This is a first for probably any Mac I’ve tried to this point and I gotta say it was unexpected and quite incredible.

The finish is long with typical sherry sweetness lingering while a very warm oak and chocolate note coat every corner and leaving the finale oily to the very end.

Well, I gotta say, this was truly an amazing, experimental dram that takes Macallan out of their sherried, comfort zone- even if only briefly.  I could get behind this type of release on a regular basis if the price point and consistency was there.  4.25-4.5 stars.  I can still taste the ginger.  Cheers my friends."

On the nose it was quite remarkable. Floral notes, brown sugar, Caramelized apple, Vanilla (the plant), very Herbal and Citric.

On the palate it just wasn't quite right. Strong liquorice note, cinnamon in an unbalanced way, very oaky not pleasant. In spanish we have this term: ""empalagoso"" which i believe that in english is ""cloying"".

Raisins, craisins, raspberries, prunes, plums, fruitcake. Apricots and figs, a bit of nutmeg and a hint of clove. Quite nutty, pecans mostly with some walnuts and a little almond. A touch of black cherries, more citrus/zest, caramel apples and light pears after some time in the glass. Slightly floral with honeysuckle and honey. Strange as it may sound I got some grape flavored hard candy and grape bubblegum as well. 

The palate is heavy with orange peel and oak up front with apricots and figs following quickly after. Tobacco, molasses, dark sherry and brown sugar. Some spice to it, but more of a wood spice than a pepper spice, though there is a bit of a pepper kick to it. Ginger, nutmeg, fruitcake or spice cake. Chocolate, vanilla, creamy, dark caramel. That weird grape candy taste showed up on the palate as well, but more of a Concord grape than candy. 

A medium bodied mouthfeel that is tongue coating and dry. 
The finish is medium long with orange peel, chocolate, wood spice, overripe pears, a bit tannic and very dry. 

Not the best Macallan I’ve ever had, but not the worst either. Honestly as far as Macallan goes, the retail price is not that bad for what you get at $90-100. Still more than it’s really worth in my opinion though. It’s a classic Macallan sherry profile with a couple curveballs thrown in there. I enjoyed it, but the overly dry mouthfeel and finish would keep me from coming back to this one. 4.25

4.25,"On the heels of underwhelming performances by the Macallan Editions 3 and 4, I turn to Edition 2 to save the show. Not that the former two were bad whiskies; it's just that they were not worth the hype or the $100 price of entry, let alone the absurd secondary market prices. Let's see if No. 2 can redeem the limited edition line.

Nose: Orange, vanilla, milk chocolate, apple, apricot, toffee, and malt. White/green grape. Sherry notes of plum, poundcake, raisin, date, fig. Very little spice; maybe just a hint of baking spice. Nowhere near what I'd expect at 48.2%. Huge oak note. It's very clean and elegant, maybe just a bit restrained. A quality Macallan nose.

Palate: Orange peel, apricot, and apple come through in a big way. More dry red fruits: raisin, date, fig. I get the milk chocolate and vanilla ice cream cake note I find in quality Macallan bottlings. Some cinnamon, black pepper, and ginger provide spice. There's also honey and toffee, some walnut and almond, and loads of oak. It's the standard Macallan profile done just right.

Finish: Orange peel zest and ginger spice. Some more of milk chocolate/vanilla ice cream cake. A bit of coffee to wash it down now. Cinnamon, clove, nutmeg provide a little kick to conclude what makes for a medium length finish.

This is the clear winner of Editions 2,3, and 4. I'm giving it a 4.25, which, if I remember correctly, puts it a full star ahead of the other two in my book. Seems like this one was a tough act to follow. I put it up there with the 15 year Fine Oak as the best Mac releases at this price point. There are a lot of similarities between the two. Both relatively light, but very refined and elegant.

Is it worth $100? Yes. Will you find it at that price? At this point, probably not. Collectors have scavenged these bottles; you can still find 3 and 4 pretty easily, and based on the results of my tastings, I don't think it's a coincidence. I lucked out and found this a few months back at retail price. They've since been cleaned out, as has every location I've checked out since.

With that in mind, just buy the Mac 18. It's probably the same price as this one when you consider what the latter goes for on the secondary-market. Regardless, this is a great effort by Macallan. They pulled out all the stops here. So after a couple of highly critical reviews, I think I owe Macallan a retroactive ""job well done"" for this fine product."
