0.25,One of the worse I have ever tasted.  Dumped my glass because it was that bad.  I wanted to give it a zero but I can’t

0.5,"Wow this is bad.  Offensive all the way through.  We were thinking about checking out the distillery tour tomorrow and changed our mind after trying this.

Nose: Lemon pledge, eucalyptus, vanilla, white sugars, pine, cedar, and wood glue.

Flavor: Exactly like it smells.  Like a solvent I'd clean my oven with.  Tastes like artificial sugars and diet soda.  

Finish: Short and brutal.  Cleaning fluids and sugar.

Wow this is horrible. Maybe the worst whiskey I've ever tasted.  I'm thinking I may dump this out just to use the bottle for something else which is a first for me.  Don't waste your money.  Seriously."
