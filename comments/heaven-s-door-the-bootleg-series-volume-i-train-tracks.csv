4.5,"Bottle #336/3797
I'm a sucker for anything that has been sitting in Mizunara, but either way this is some good whisky. Very smooth for being 55.75%. You can't miss the Mizunara in this bottle. In my experience most Canadian whiskys are very light on flavor, which is perfect when matching with the Japanese oak. I will say that at a $500 price point, is it quite expensive. The bottle is gorgeous and the packaging is as well, which helps round the price out."
5.0,Amazingly bright whiskey given its age.  The mizunara oak finish provides hints of chocolate and incense.  Opens with 2 drops of water to show an exquisite whiskey.
