4.0,"Vanilla lemon, lemon head candies, moons over madigascar black tea, moist deli ham from the peat.

Black tea mouthfeel/sweetness, light, watered down fruit juice, lavender, flowery fruity. Peat shows its face every once in awhile. Blanched peanuts. Salt brine. 

Hot, but not overly. 

It smells like a good malt. Notes aside, I can smell quality."
4.0,"Pale sunlight in color. The nose is youthful, zingy, and green; I smell lemon peel, the skin of Granny Smith apples, agave nectar, and wet hay — finally, a gently smoky peat scent arises. The palate boasts first and foremost that honeycomb-like, waxy Highland Park trademark; it's muted and smooth at first, with malt, toasted pine nuts, and light salt mildly held together. As I spend more time with it, its more delicate notes come around — hibiscus, herbal tea, thyme, and tarragon. The peat plays a supporting role, giving the dram an herbal feel rather than a smoky one. It finishes with some heat, but it's not unpleasant. The aftertaste is sweet and nutty. Perfect for an everyday pour during the warm months."
3.0,"This is different from what you usually get from HP. The usual combo of light orkney peat and sherry with a splash of brine are still there, but they’re tuned back noticeably. Its younger so you’re getting more of the distillery character and straight malt. The nose is very light, but the flavor is much more like a classic highland. Definitely interesting, and worth the $35  I think its close to a younger, lighter HP 12 (Viking’s Honor)."

3.25,"As one of Scotland’s oldest and most respected independent bottlers, Gordon & MacPhail represents a reliable source of quality Single Malts. The nose of this 8-year-old Highland Park is light and delicate with sour apricots, vanilla toffee and faint hints of smoke. Young, fresh and gingery in the arrival, the taste develops with honey sweetness, mango and traces of black pepper. Again, not much peat. A slightly dry and bitter aftertaste accompanies the clean but one-dimensional finish. I think that a few more years in the casks would have been very beneficial.
