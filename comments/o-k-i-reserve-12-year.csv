4.75,"Nose- caramel apples, dill, black pepper, baking spices, rye bread

Palate- Sweet apples, green jolly rancher, pineapple, gingerbread, caramel, light toasted oak, french vanilla

OUTSTANDING. This is one of the top bourbons ive ever tried. The nose is beautiful, light and balanced- while still being very complex. The palate is amazing. Super unique, with notes of pineapple and green jolly ranchers- something i’ve never got in a bourbon before. My only complaint is I don’t have more."
