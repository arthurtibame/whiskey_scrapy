4.0,"Purchased in Hong Kong. limited edition bottled at 48% proof with a post restart Single Malt Komagatake blend aged at least three years in bourbon and American white oak casks.

Very pleasant nose with bananas, pear and fruit. These notes follow through in the taste with added vanilla and some light peat on the finish."
