5.0,"tremendous. silky smooth for a barrel-proof. while i don't love wheated bourbons, this one delivers."
3.0,Neat - very hot in fact hard to appreciate the initial flavor because the heat comes so quickly and hits you like a jackhammer.  I had to put some water in it to enjoy it 😳
5.0,"An amazing Whiskey, it needs some water and a cube to really bring out the full flavour with such a high ABV."

5.0,"NOSE: Nutmeg, rich vanilla bean, dark wood, worn leather. PALATE: caramel, toffee, molasses soaked bread, but somehow not overtly sweet, hint of pine, rich mouthfeel, oily. FINISH: Spearmint, salted caramel, touch of smoke, very long. With a couple spoonfuls of water nose is more caramel, less wood and leather. Palate opens up nicely, and more sweetness comes through. Finish does not seem overly changed. Superb bourbon."

5.0,Strong. Very old wood musty. Strong alcohol and strond flavour. Nose of markers (volatIle organic compounds). It lingers and lingers in the mouth. Does well with diet coke.

5.0,Lovely bourbon. Even with such a high ABV it's not noticeable. Butterscotch taste with great balance. Believe it or not adding water does not make it better. With water it makes it easier to drink sure but you lose some of the balance. It becomes mild overall. Straight is the way to go.

4.0,"An aroma of creamed corn with a few more slices of butter melting on top. Ahh my favorite, shaved coconut. Dry wood staves splashed with brine. Heavy vanilla cream at the end. The palate bites back though. It launches out with huge spices and a little bit of tannins before you can get at the rest of it. Adding a few drops of water freshens the wood on nose. The water reveals the sweet grassy taste of wheat but the alcohol is still domineering. Oily caramel and a hot spearmint finish. For me, water is a must for this. The aroma is everything you could want but the palate will bite you if you don't rub its belly right."

5.0,"What a stunningly beautiful whiskey in the glass.  Weller is a deep, rich copper tone with hints of auburn.  Breathe in the scents of late summer, autumn and the harvest season, and conclude with winter in a delightful progression:  cherries and ripe fruit first, followed by rich brown sugar and buttered corn, with maple syrup and vanilla emerging after several minutes.  Then back to fall with the powerful, slightly boozy palate, to savor the taste of apple turnovers, caramel, and orchard fruits.  Weller finishes with notes of sweet caramel, traces of banana, leather, oil, cinnamon, and oak.  I don't like adding water to whiskey, but with a barrel-proof beast, it's sometimes worth a shot.  Here, oak, leather, and brown sugar emerge more prominently in the nose.  The palate and finish were similar, with reduced heat (of course) and an increased spiciness.
 
Like Cousin Pappy and other wheated bourbons in general, Weller offers an intriguing, sweeter take on American bourbon.  I haven't had Pappy in a long time, but it is hard to believe a wheater gets much better than this Weller.  I hate to keep giving these Buffalo Trace Antique Collection bottles such high marks, which doesn't tell you guys anything new, but they are superb bourbons.  I was looking for flaws but couldn't find any.  Like any other barrel-proof bourbon, you have to be prepared for that high heat, but Weller's aging -- in excess of 12 years -- makes it a smooth sipper given its strength.  A no-brainer if you see it anywhere for $150 or less, but most people's only hope is the secondary market, where this bottle can fetch an intolerable (for me, anyways) $600+."

4.5,"Gad damn that's good. Maybe the best smelling whiskey I've ever had the privilege to have. Neat is a little harsh cause of the proof, but you can tell it's expensive. Any harshness evaporates quickly and you are left with a dusty sweet leather that quickly brings you to a card game with Doc Holiday and you've got a full house. The saloon is staring at you, wondering with baited eyes, what you are going to do. Bet it all, cause this moment is rare. A great whiskey, but enjoy it, dash it with water after your first sip. Your trip to the past should last longer than this whiskey will in your glass."
