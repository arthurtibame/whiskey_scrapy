4.0,I like it. Aroma carries a warm sweet and rustic profile with the wine notes pairing nicely with the bourbon notes; Palate is also sweet and rustic withe some tartness – it carries a nice complexity; Finish is lively and heavy and goes on and on. The wine and whiskey notes come through on equal footing.

4.25,"Very complex taste. Great combination of oak, blackberries, and vanilla. Medium finish that is warm. Really enjoyed this bourbon the second time around. Grab a bottle if you can find it."

4.75,"Nose- The 100 proof point comes through with some heat but there is also vanilla and interestingly cloves.
Body- Cherry and thick tongue coating tannins, this is a bourbon for wine drinkers. Very rich but tastes lower in proof than it is. 
Finish- The cherry and berry notes fall away to a rich vanilla and clove. 

This is a fantastic bourbon! I have heard good things of Bardstown and this one has definitely piqued my interest in the distillery. In fact I bought several of these as it is a one and done bottling from my understanding. A great bourbon when you want something rich with heavy fruit notes."

3.5,"The price: ** justifies the age and care for this bourbon but there are better tasting bourbons around for the price
Nose: ****smells of caramel corn, orange peel, nutmeg, and blueberry crumble
Taste:****Delicious taste of blueberries, maple, with lots of cloves and nutmeg. Great whiskey for the fall or winter and definitely worth a try. 
Finish:*** medium-dry finish like a nice dry red wine
Uniqueness:**** Barrel finishing isn’t a new concept and many distilleries have started trying their hand with other liquors but not many use no-fortified reds."
