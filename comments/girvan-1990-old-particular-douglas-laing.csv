3.5,"Girvan was only built in 1963 as a grain distillery and interestingly it's also the home of Ailsa Bay distillery since 2007. I'm on a bit of a roll with grain spirits as as you dig deeper into the older independent labels the flavour profile is just really different to what I was expecting generally i.e. not a flat lifeless blend type thing.  This is an interesting dram. Really get cherry coming through, mild cough syrup. Really weird as its like a mild Balcones or something. Definitely not what i was expecting. 3.5"
