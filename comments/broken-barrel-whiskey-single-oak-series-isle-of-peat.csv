4.5,I love this whiskey! Nice smoke and sweetest combine.
4.75,"Strong campfire forward, slight damp/tobacco notes, char finish, long lasting flavor. Lingers a lot."
1.5,"Meh… Aroma isn’t bad, just boring and comes through like slightly spicy clay; Palate is a touch fruity but mostly young and woody; Finish is the best part and seems to pull out more mature and complex notes than the rest."
