3.0,"The nose and palate remind me of a young bourbon but with a lot of strong oak flavor.  There's a bit of cherry and more oak on the finish.

After drinking Redbreast 12, I realized this one is simiilar on the nose and palate.  They are both labelled as ""Pot Distilled"", which might be part of it."

3.0,Bourbon like in flavor with a lighter feel from the barley.
