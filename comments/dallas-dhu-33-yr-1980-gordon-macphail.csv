3.75,"Rugby changing room urinals was my first thought. Those minty smelling things they put in the urinals to make them smell nice. Peppermint, green apple are the strong characteristics with this one. Waxy grass clippings others have noted which I get. I'm not usually a mint person but this strikes the right notes although I couldn't drink loads of this. All in all the ghost drams were a good experience but personally I think there are better examples out there from G&M e.g. St. Magdalene 1975 I had a couple of years ago. Given in 3 samples I just tasted 100 years and $2500USD (on a bottle basis) of drams  I personally think you are better off buying loads of modern day classics or even older single cask versions of current day distilleries e.g. Glendronach, Benriach."
