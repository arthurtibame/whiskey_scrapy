3.75,"Cherry, vanilla, oak, good balance in a lighter drinker"
4.25,"Kind of rolled the dice on this one, and the payoff way excellent. I'm a big fan of Speyside Whisky and sherry finishes so this was perfect."
4.0,Light and fruity on the nose with a little oak. Sweet citrus fruit and char on the pallet. The char is subtle. I love the sherry finished scotches so this is right up my alley. There’s a lot going on in this blend and  that’s what makes it special. Can’t beat the price.
