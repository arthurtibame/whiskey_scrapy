3.5,"Originally sold only to the japanese market, this four roses have the most beautiful bottle of the whole brand, but regretfully, it is much alike the rest of the bourbons this distillery make, a boring, normal and a little harsh dram.

Bottled at 43%abv 

Vanilla, caramel, banana. Your typical bourbon on the nose. It has a metallic note that is common (for me) in some older bourbons.

On the palate, prunes, clove and a mild starting sweetness of toffee. Normal dram.

Aftertaste is oaky, spicy. Clove. Not long. 

Overall, i give this dram a 70 over 100, a normal four roses score."

2.25,"At first I didn’t understand why the reviews were so harsh on this...then I tried a couple ounces.

It’s got a pretty harsh nose, initial palate is sweet with a little bit of pepper. The finish is probably the worst I’ve ever had...it  literally just drops off and almost tastes like carbonated water."
1.5,"Thin sweet metallic bourbon, no finish. Almost a low end scotch feel to it."
