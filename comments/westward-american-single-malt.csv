5.0,Sweet malted notes of different variations from start to finish.  Sweet malt on the nose.  Buttery Sweet Malt up front on the palate quickly lends way to a creamier Malted Easter Egg note. Finishes with sweet and spicy malt.  A unique and delicious Whiskey.

Palate:banana bread with some vanilla and caramel. 
Finish: medium finish with charred oak and malt

2.25,Wasn't a big fan. Just one note of barley with some barrel spice. It has potential but isn't there yet

2.0,Pinot noire finish. I didn’t like this dram. Very strange taste. Couldn’t taste the malt. Not sweet. Not peat. Not a fan.

4.25,"The quality of the product is 5 star.   However it is Young and has a bite to it.   I little water helps.  Nose of a bright, floral brown sugar smell. Taste of Carmel notes.  Looking forward to a. 5 or 10 year."
4.0,"Nose: sweet cereal grain.  Banana bread with walnuts, clove, and nutmeg.  Faint mint.

Palate: definite barley.  Mint/peppermint, banana, cardamom, cumin, nutmeg, clove.  Dark fruits.  Faint black peppercorn."

2.0,Portland weird?  I can't place it but it's just weird.  Very complex for a single malt but the nose was too funky for me to get past.  I think this is a love it or hate it selection.

4.5,"Upon opening, Westward has a pleasant unique bourbon taste.  On the nose,  I get...sigh...usual bourbon but SURPRISE,  something different on the palate and finish.   One of the best bourbons I have rated."

4.5,Strong coffee finish!
3.0,"Oak and spice. Definitely get a different note because of the barley. Bright citrus, and lighter vanillas and more floral hints come out with a bit of water. 

A little oily and lingers. 

Overall a solid American malt. Have not had many but this could be a daily drinker."

null,"Tried this at the whisky extravaganza. This has fruity notes, notes of caramel, chocolate, bacon, and tobacco spice. With the exception of a few, most of my ratings from whisky extravaganza event will be n/a rated as there were too many to try to get a good taste/opinion on it."

3.5,"Brash and boozy nose with a bit of varnish greeting you at the door. Shot of back palate spice then an intriguing finish with a couple shades of savor, with a hearty almost garlicky moment near the end. Didn’t like at first but keep coming back for that finale. Definitely add a decent amount of water."

3.5,"It's got a yeasty, funky, stinky note at first on the nose, which dissipates over time, but never really goes away. It reduces enough to reveal berries and citrus.
It's light on the palate with sweet fruit, malt and a hint of the funky yeast.
Shortish, spicy finish."
4.0,Excellent American malt - distilled in my home town! 🥳
3.5,"Baked apples on the nose, creme brûlée on the palate. I know this doesn’t make sense, but the aftertaste reminds me of how my local laser tag facility smelled like. Shoutout to Laser Quest."
null,On ice. Bright bite at first with a clean and earthy finish as it goes down. Faintly tart.
