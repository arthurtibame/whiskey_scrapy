5.0,"Oh my god... and a great review by Jake Emen. 

Apples and pineapple on the nose with a touch of toasted barley and honey. Very creamy on the palate with wood spices, vanilla and floral notes. The finish is quite long and, though fiery (this IS cask strength), with great finesse. 

This whisky is a work of art!"
