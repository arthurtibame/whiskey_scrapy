5.0,"Cask PT268. The best Penderyn from the Penderyn drammers club event. This is currently aged 3 years in buffalo trace barrels and 3 further years in a port barrel that once held an amazing port wine and is still maturing. This cask sample is great with notes of chocolate, vanilla, strawberries, raspberries, jam, raisins, citrus, barley, and spices."
