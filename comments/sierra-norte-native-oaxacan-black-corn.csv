4.5,"You can get a lot of tobacco, bitter dark chocolate, and hog feed corn cobs (worked on a farm and those corn cobs are on every corn whiskey I’ve had) on the nose. There is also almost like an apple cider vinegar note on the nose also which sounds weird but weirdly works. On the taste it’s all bitter dark chocolate, tobacco, and then a sweet (I think barrel) note. It is very rich and oily. It’s a funky journey and if you like outlier/weird whiskey."

4.0,"Bananas and plantains on the tongue, for sure, with some almond on the finish, which was of good length. Almost had the most of a tequila, but not quite sure of that was psychosomatic or not. Either way, this was definitely both good and interesting, which is a pretty rare combo for such a distillery, if you’re asking me. (Are you? Call me, maybe.)"
