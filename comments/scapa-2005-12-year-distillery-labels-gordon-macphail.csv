null,"This whiskey has a super unique profile, it’s unlike most scotches- zero sulphur on the nose, smooth mouth entry, tasty Sauvignon blanc elements on the palat, quick finish . it’s a perfect scotch bourbon marriage because they both cancel out each other’s weaknesses- making this a smooth light buttery sipper. My only gripe is it’s viscosity - it’s very thin and watery;  but somehow all of it it works quite well."

Light, sweet, honey nose.  The taste is a lovely salty sweetness. No real need for water. In fact when I added water - only a little - it killed it."
