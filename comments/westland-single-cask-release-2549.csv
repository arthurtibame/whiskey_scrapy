4.0,"All notes made after diluting from 60% bottling strength
Very pale in colour, especially after adding water to dilute to approximately 40%

Nose
Orchard fruits like apples and pears, vanilla and spice.  Honey, and cinnamon raisin oatmeal

Palate
Initial sweetness, immediately followed by an opposing bitterness.  Almost reminiscent of Irish whisky flavors.  Malty fullness spreading towards the back of the mouth, and the sides of the tongue.  Spice is very forefront

Finish
Malty and some lingering oak towards the back of the mouth

I'm having trouble deciding on a summary of this one because I'm not getting a wide range of flavors and not a very rich presence overall.  Enjoyable nonetheless and the experience of filling it from the barrel definitely added to it!"
4.0,"Quite pale in colour - light straw coloured. 

Diluted to approximately 40% from 60%.

Nose: Very pleasant with floral notes, apple, and pear.  Also some leather.

Palate: High alcohol and requires some water. Initial honey sweetness. Some spicy notes follow then some interesting muskiness, which is quite unique. 

Finish: Long with lingering musky and leathery notes. Chewing on this one for a while after it's gone. 

Excellent flavour profile bit still somewhat harsh and tastes quite young."
