4.0,"I have read that vintage expressions from Dalmore from the late 90s to the early 2000s aren't what you expected from one of my top favorite distilleries. Nevertheless i had to try for myself if such thing is true, so when i ran into this Port Vintage 1998 Dalmore i did not hesitate to ask a dram of it. Lets see how things went.

Bottled at 44%abv. 

On the nose, not your typical Dalmore, Port wood profiles are all over the place: Tobacco, Orange candy, Soap (oh oh), Coffee. Old Orange peel, Brown sugar, But there is this soap in the back.
Chocolate bathed oranges. After first sip nose opens into a good coffee note with hints of Burnt oak. Not balanced, maybe a little too crazy. 

On the palate, it is very nice and easy drinkable but maybe boring.
You can hold it easily;  Almonds, Chesnuts and Caramel. That's it.

Aftertaste is by far the best part of it, with a lovely finish of Chocolate powder, Cinnamon spice and a very pleasant Tobacco finish. 

Overall it feels like tobacco is present everywhere in this dram in a good way. It wasn't the best Dalmore, and it just barely made it to the 4 star mark, i am not fond of port whiskies so i might not be the best on to judge this one, for me it is a 80/100."
