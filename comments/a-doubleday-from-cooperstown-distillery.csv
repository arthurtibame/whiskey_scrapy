4.25,"Nose: Like crushed, dry corn kernels. Hay, dry farm dust...basically like a barn but really nice. 

Palate: Corn heavy, spicy, peppery, cinnamon, oatmeal, no sweetness

Finish: warm from the inside out"

3.0,"Young, sourced bourbon. Very plain; corn and hay. Lingering after taste that I don't love.  The real story here is the artful bottle--especially if you're a baseball fan.  The bottle is a perfectly shaped and formed baseball--exact details down to the 108 stitches of a regulation Major League baseball. If you turn the bottle over, you'll see that the base of the bottle is made of a baseball diamond. The very cork itself is made from ash, a common wood for baseball bats. The whiskey is a bit overshadowed by the bottle, but I keep it on my bar anyway as a nice decoration and conversation piece."
3.5,Has an after taste that I’m not a big fan of.
