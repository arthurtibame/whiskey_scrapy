4.25,I love the combination of sea salt and smoke with what feels like a citrus on the back of the palette a slight prickle on the front of the tongue as well makes this a good (for me) cold weather scotch. But really any weather is scotch weather.

En bouche, attaque franche sur la tourbe qui dégage une belle puissance avant de se fondre dans un agréable sirop provenant du sherry
La finale est sympa sans plus, un peu fumée mais surtout ronde, avec beaucoup de persistance, c’est cool."

5.0,"Sweet smokey, but balanced, nose with a surprising amount of sherry and fruit.  Sweet fruity smoke, followed by a definite treacle wave - caramel and butterscotch notes that evolve into dry wood with smokey notes.  The smoke and treacle are perfectly melded.  This is perfect on it's own, but would make a phenomenal pairing with the right desert."

4.5,Beautiful peaty flavor with sherry note. And sweetness comes from 10yrs one.
4.5,"NOSE: Sweet deep nose with rich smoky peat and liquorice. Burning dry leaves. Once the smoke clears, you get soft sherry raisins and pears. Glazed ham.

TASTE: Bright strong palate with leather and smoke. Without water it’s fire. Sugary sweetness comes out with added water drops. Bacon jam. Tastes like dry earth in a good way. Ends with slight cocoa bitterness from oak casks.

FINISH: Smooth oily finish lingers medium length with leather and dark fruits from sherry cask. Fantastic finish.

OVERALL: Strooong flavor. Great marriage of peat and sherry, with a strong bias of deep & rich peaty flavors but smooth sherry finish. If you enjoy things like bacon, aged cheese, jams, and smoked ham, you will fall for this bottle once you get used to the smoke."

It’s followed by a candied sweetness, dark chocolate and it lingers for a bit. I got a lot of herbal notes on the back end of it. I’ll need to sit with a 2 oz pour on the weekend to fully digest it but it’s by far one of my favorite islays so far and it’s so readily available."

4.5,"Like a seaweed bonfire that someone tries to choke down by adding layers of peat moss. Oh wait, there’s more: sweet notes of caramel shows up, just to be carried away by Ardberg’s typical phenolic taste. And it just stays there. Forever and ever. Excellent dram!"
4.25,"What is this after taste? Sweet? Salty? Yes and yes. A dram of this demands your attention and oilyness that clings to your tongue. It takes time to acculamate to the flavors hitting you, but give it time and you'll be glad you did. If you're looking for a little bit of a spanking, get a bottle of this."

5.0,"Info: Le nom de ce whisky est en effet celui du nom de la source qui donne à la distillerie d'Ardbeg (et, je n'ai pas besoin de vous expliquez pourquoi cette source est si importante pour la confection de ces whisky). Essentiellement, il s'agit de l'assemblage de fûts de 10 ans et de 13 ans ainsi que de quelques futs des années 1970. Imaginez le Ardbeg Ten jumelé avec un Sherry Cask de 13 ans. Cette version (celle embouteillée à 54,2%) fut élu ""meilleur single malt au monde de l'année 2009"" par Jim Murray (auteur de The Whisky Bible). Ugeadail se prononce ""Oog-a-dal"". Pour ce qui est des récompenses... la liste est longue mais en voici les principales mentions:
-  Gold, Liquid Gold Award - 2014, Jim Murray's Whisky Bible;
-  Winner, World Whisky of the Year - 2009, Jim Murray's Whisky Bible;
-  Gold, Scotch Single Malt - Islay - 2014, International Wine & Spirit Competition;
-  Silver, Islay Single Malt No Age Statement - 2014, World Whiskies Awards;
-  Gold, Islay up to 12 years old - 2013, The Scotch Whisky Masters (The Spirits Business);
-  Gold, Single Malt Scotch - to 12 Yrs - 2013, San Francisco World Spirits Competition
etc.

Nez: Tourbe typique d'Ardbeg, Sucre brun et café (ou Coca-Cola). 

Bouche: Ok c'est pas du stuff de débutant là! C'est une tourbe généreuse et un taux élevé. Les deux barrières fortes vont en bloquer plusieurs. À laisser respirer un bon 45 minutes, sinon il est très fermé! Une fois ouvert et accoutumé, la deuxième vague d'arôme est perceptible. Riche, café et sucre brun. Viande fumée. Intense, chaud et Maritime. Quelque chose de algueux. Un Whisky d'hiver. ça me rappel un peu de la viande mariné à la sauce BBQ et au miel. 

Finale: viande et ce goût de coke encore. 

Overall: Je ne vais pas vous mentir, je suis vendu Ardbeg. C'est la bouteille que j'avais gouté il y a bien longtemps et qu'à mes débuts je ne pouvait apprécier. Elle est resté longtemps sur l'étagère mais a descendu très rapidement par la suite. Intense, équilibré, complexe, mystérieux. Un peu jeune et agressif mais, extrêmement satisfaisant. Un de mes préférés! 96%"

4.5,"It is absolutely bone chilling cold tonight, perfect weather for peaty whisky. Uigeadail features some sherry cask maturation unlike the regular 10 year which should add some fruitiness. Also added a few drops of water due to the cask strength of the whisky.

Nose: initially a vegetal peat smoke and no pcp (this for me is a plus), after this is dark fruits almost like raisins. Holding the grlencairn a few inches from my nose makes the fruits more present. Something almost like used coffee grounds also shows up after a while along with cigar ash.
Palette: initially sweet that then turns to a vegetal peat smoke. A hint of vanilla also dances around at times. The cask strength adds a very pleasant warming affect as well.
Finish: long and smokey that then turns to a bitterness akin to dark chocolate, maybe the most pleasant part of the dram.

A wonderful cold weather whisky. Found the peat extremely pleasant as it was more vegetal than medicinal. The sherry casks also add a great fruitiness that added an extra layer of depth. At almost $100 certainly not a value dram but very enjoyable and certainly worth the entry price.

Slainte!"

A rare scotch that also allows proof to provide a new level of complexity to the spirit, and concentration of flavors.  Uncut it certainly does seem concentrated and bold.

Heavy smoke and salty-sweet.  Intense and bold flavors from the batch proof.  The nose is spent fireworks.  Some sulfur mixed with sea, so a more “clean” smell.  Perhaps lava sliding into the ocean.

There is a deep smoky char, but palatable.  Liquid smoke.  Has a strong drying component in the mouth."

4.5,"Nose - I'm sitting in a comfy chair smelling a fruit basket (plums, raisins, and apricots) in the basement of a castle, only lit by a gentle fire burning driftwood. someone is smoking meat in the other room. my brother sprays a quick spray of aerosol into the air then pours me a glass of dark wine. It's 8:25 pm.

taste - earthy, mossy, damp, creamy, salty, the perfect amount of sweetness.
Outside, right on the edge of a familiar and friendly forest. It just finished raining lightly, and the woods are only a little wet. It's a bit after 10 pm mid-summer. I just put out the fire in a stone pit, smoke everywhere. The ground is a bit damp and covered in sawdust. I bite into an orange, peel on, and immediately spit it out. Then I eat a cold small piece of crispy charred bacon, followed by a piece of licorice, and wash it down with wine. Then a bite of rum raisin ice cream."

3.5,"The nose is fully of sticky, sweet sherry, peat smoke with caramel, toffee, and coffee. There is a bit of roasted honeycrisp apple underneath. After it sat out a bit, the nose became full of Werther's originals, and then the caramel turned milky sweet, reminiscent of tres leches. The palate is thick and oily with sweet peat smoke and plenty of barrel notes, particularly oak, alongside the caramel from the nose which comes through in a darker, burned sugar kind of way. Toasted barley and brine beats back the sweetness for a moment. Bandaid shows up before the sweet peat smoke comes back, bringing a faint tobacco and oak along. The longer you sit with it, the more it steers back to a leathery, apple honey taste. A couple of drops of water rounds all of the edges off. This dram is dark and brooding with just enough brightness to keep from being too much. I tried this side by side with the An Oa and found this to be the more challenging, complex drink that rewards careful sipping while the An Oa is an easier drinking, brighter expression that tastes like an Islay for Speyside drinkers."

4.5,Very sharp and sweet on the nose. The smell of sea spray and brine is apparent right of the bat with an accompaniment of smoke. Definitely noticeable sweet wood on the nose as well due to the influence of sherry casks. Some sweetness on the palate that is immediately followed by brine and smoke. Generous finish with more of a kick due to the higher alcohol content. More complex than the 10 with slightly sweeter notes but the classic Ardbeg flavors are still very much present.

4.75,"Nose: lightly peaty (much lighter than I was expecting) and DARK. I mean chocolate, and dark fruits (raisins, prunes, and also orange), burnt campfire wood
Palate: Woah. The light and nuanced (but very pleasant) nose is followed by an absolute bomb of flavor. Medium-strong campfire smoke followed by a tasty sweetness. The fruitiness persists along with caramel and nuts. 
Finish: EXTREMELY LONG and oily. Salted caramel and freshly roasted almonds, along with bitter chocolate and coffee grounds dry out the finish leading to the next sip.
Water: Completely changed when water was added. The fruitiness subsided, only to be replaced by chocolate, coffee, almonds, and a sugary glaze. This must be what they meant when they described marshmallows by a campfire. Unbelievable with or without water. 
My Rating: 5/5 -- I’m in awe. What a perfect balance of smoke and sweet. I took a risk grabbing this one when the peatiest single-malt I’ve had up to this point was Talisker 10. This takes everything I enjoyed in Talisker and kicks it up to well beyond 11, and adds in the darker flavors I prefer in a whisky (like chocolate and dark fruits). Flavors of fruit, sweet, and smoke are boosted, but because they are all elevated, they still balance each other out beautifully, leading to an even more full experience. And this was before I even added water. You could almost call it a different whisky when you add water, as it sacrifices the fruitiness for the dark chocolate and glaze. This could be the most complex whisky I’ve ever tasted so far, and I am beyond elated that I grabbed this on a whim. Excited for what else I’ll discover with this, as it has become my hands-down favorite whisky (of any category). My strongest DOUBLE GOLD."

4.5,"Nose: Barrel, Toffee, Cinnamon

Taste: Pear, Smoke, moves to sugary sweet (Sherry). Aftertaste is very dry, oily, and full.

Overall, everything the 10 year wants to be. The increased sweetness from the sherry is balanced by the higher proof. The mouth feel is so full and enveloping, and the transition from the first taste to the after taste is a significant event."
4.5,"Ardbeg Uigeadail, Islay, 95 pts. It’s certainly darker and has more vanilla, raisin and sherry notes than the 10, but it’s not nearly as smoky. The alcohol is more forward and there’s a subtle medicinal quality from the iodine."

4.0,"I got a 50ml sample of this with my bottle of Ardbeg 10. Finally decided to break it open and give it a try.
*Appearance: Straw colored with just a hint of orangish hue. A swirl yields a few fat slow moving legs. Seems thick and oily.
*Nose: The peat presents as smoked meat. A little ash & soot. Savory. Just a hint of the magic marker note that dominates the 10 for me. A little time in the Glencairn and a light swirl rewards you with some fruit/sherry notes in the background. There is a creamy/buttery note as well. There is a definite alcohol sting from the cask proof.
*Neat: Thick and Oily, Heavy and Chewy. You get heavy peat/soot and ash on the initial sip. Subsequent sips reveal flavors of vanilla, honey, apple, and sherry. Balanced. No one note dominates. Aggressive slightly sour finish with big, tingly peppery heat and menthol and ash coating the palate. This coating fades from menthol cigarette to cigar smoke. 
Splash: Doesn't change much at first, but eventually the sherry notes become a little bolder on the nose and palate. Reduces the stinging pepper a bit, as well as muting the menthol. 
Verdict: A slight step up from the 10, but I can't help thinking that maybe some of the younger whisky in here asserts itself just a tad too much. I definitely didn't think it was $20 better than the 10($75 vs $55). While I like the Ardbeg, I still find myself in the Laphroaig and Bruichladdich camps."

When imbibed, the smokiness is encapsuled and the tariness turns into a viola/liquorice bouquet. Like a 1745 fishing vessel traversing across the surf down my gullet. Despite its high ABV it is remarkably smooth and easy to drink. Ciao!"

5.0,"This is a big Scotch. If you don't enjoy peat, I would just move along. However, if you enjoy the classic Islay, ashy peat then this is a beauty. The nose has big sherry notes, with lots of raisin and sweetness. The smoke comes up quickly too and balances off the fruit. When I take a sip, this one explodes in the palate. Lots of smoke, ash, pepper, and finally settles back to allow the vanilla and sweet sugars to come back. A few more sips and it's balanced again with cooked fruits, BBQ, and smoke. The finish on this is long and moves through various stages. At first I'm getting lots of tobacco and leather, then a bitter medicinal stage, but ends off with that deep, cooked down fruit or dry red wine. There are edges of youth, with bitterness and sharpness in the nose, however, overall I just love this one. Thanks, Ardbeg!"

4.5,"The setup: gleincarn, rested 5 minutes. Bottle opened 2 months ago and it is my fourth dram since opening it. Drank over 2 and a half hours.

Nose: for the first 3-4 sips : heavy but sweet peat. After: sweet dried fruits, peat, bit salty.

On the palate: first few sips: peat and dried fruits. Quite powerful but pleasant. After a few sips: less peat, awesome dried fruits and briny.

For the finish: long and peaty, fruits or molasse and quite powerful but balanced and sweet.

Conclusion: awesome dram! It seems like it is worth letting it sit for a while; in the first hour, I only took 3 sips or so and kept smelling. It’s got a really nice nose. Once you get past the peat, the fruits get me hooked; it’s sweet and excellent!"

4.25,"First off, I have to start with a big thank you to @Scott_E for this generous pour! I figured I'd get this holiday started with a big bang! This is my first Peated Cask Strength Scotch experience and I am both excited and somewhat intimidated! I feel like I am in a place in my Scotch journey where I have tasted enough Peated malts that I should hopefully be able to appreciate it. Let's dive in:
No shock here as it enters you are smacked in the face with a big peat note! What is surprising is just how smooth and easy the entry is. Welcome sweet Sherry and golden graham notes follow the peat with a hint of pepper. The mid palette adds light honey and cocoa notes. The finish is like lonnnnggggg with the peat, Sherry and graham cracker combo with maybe just a hint of citrus. 
Lovely dram and ridiculously easy to drink for the proof. No water added or needed for me. 
Now could this be a frequent pour for me? No, not yet! It's just too big and I would go for a Lag 16 or Talisker 10. However, would I like to own a bottle for when I want a big, bold experience? Absolutely! 
Thanks again @Scott_E and cheers all. This made a perfect Thursday nightcap!"

5.0,"Whoa now this is great stuff.  Its definitely heavy on the peat and smoke side but its well balanced by all the undertones imparted by the sherry casks.  It adds an entire new layer to this Islay that isn't present in other standard bottlings.  Besides the standard peat, smoke, and ash Ardbeg is known for, we have a whole host of fruitiness pointed by raisins, lemon, citrus and vegetal hints.  This is amazing, through and through.  Don't let anyone tell you the quality is decreasing, this is worth its asking price and then some."

5.0,The uigeadail is one of the finest whiskies I've ever had the pleasure of trying.  Bottled at cask strength intensifies the power and the intensity of the peat while the aged sherry finished portion provides a sweetness reminiscent of dried fruits. Being 54% abv you would think it would be harsh but it is incredibly smooth and has a viscocity that coats the mouth.  That said my favourite way to drink this is to take small sips that allow the whisky to just warm the mouth and fill it with flavour.  The finish seems to last forever with lingering smoke and fruit and if you have the patience to drink your dram over the course of an hour or so you will find that it reveals different layers of nuance almost everytime you go back to it.

4.25,"Delicious. Nose is sweet and briney. Palate is immediately the classic Islay peat smoke, but it's very quickly followed by a salty sweetness from the Sherry cask. It's such a delightful combination, that while it seems juxtaposed, melds seamlessly together from start to finish. Mouth feel is oily and coats the mouth. Finish is smokey again, with the cask strength finally showing its true colors, giving a brief bight."

4.75,"Honey color. Nose certainly brings the peaty, iodine character of Islay, but a bit more subtle than the Ardbeg 10yr, with far more complexity. I get ocean spray and drying seaweed, along the sweetness of honey and vanilla ice cream. Not much ethanol on the nose for such a high proof. The palate is just as complex as the nose, rich and smokey with the sweetness of stone fruits dried over a campfire, and a subtle meaty note on the back palate. Mouthfeel is thick and oily, with more ethanol burn than was hinted at by the nose. Finish is very long and warm. The campfire flavor stays with you for a long time, with some graham crackers and a very light, fruity sweetness. This is just about a prefect dram."

4.0,"Nose: Strong smoke up front immediately after pouring, but it subsides after sitting in the glass for some time (or I just get used to it). The smoke has a pleasant bitterness like coffee. Soft fruity notes add to the reminder of coffee. Subtle peach ring candy notes

Taste: tasting smaller sips yields a clearer palate, which is much easier to pick apart. Normal tasting is much smokier and tougher to see through the smoke. Bittersweet dark chocolate, burnt peach cobbler, iodine, medicinal"
4.5,"Nose:  Light coal ash, the Tools aisle in Home Depot, tobacco leaves, old leaves and wet peat, smoked meats, and a hint of mint.  coming back to it there's this sweet, almost-overdone caramel.  The peat smoke had drastically died down, revealing some salted candied-pecans, another bit of sweetness like molasses and dates, as swell as some cinnamon brown-sugar candied bacon (Mmmmm.....).

Palate:  Peppery and hot at first, like peppered beef jerky.  Lots of black and white pepper, sawdust, buttermilk biscuits, leather, tobacco, warm sea brine.  Much more brine on the second wash, with heavily toasted barley, the crust off a loaf of wheat bread, and campfire smoke.

Finish: Long and warm!  There's this earthy sawdust/tobacco/leather note that lasts and lasts through occasional spikes of black pepper and Buckwheat honey (which if you ever get a chance to try, is totally worthwhile).

Water:  Just a few drops of water brings out an explosion of honey, caramel, and molasses on the nose, with a newly defined leather note, seaweed, and smoke from burning leaves.  Much calmer on the tongue, which levels out much of the spice into something like a smokey pine resin.  The finish is all ash and sawdust now.

Conclusion:  This one confirms my suspicion that my nose is much better than my tastebuds - I could pick apart the nose on this for days, but the palate is a bit more uniform to me.  There's some great complexity in here - not just a whole bunch of peat smoke in a bottle.  As far as entry level Islays go, this might be my go to.  The only thing that would make it better would be a tad more sherry influence - I want some smokey, stewed dark fruits."

4.5,"I’ve been sitting on this one for a while trying to decide if I have anything to say about it that hasn’t already been said. It’s Ardbeg. At cask strength. It goes down a little different every time but it’s always amazing. 

In light of copious tasting notes for this one, I think it’s more prudent to tell a story. I invited a buddy over who’s been having a rough go at work and was clearly in need of a drink. He asked me to curate his whisky experience, so I opened my cabinet and we had some fun. I gave him a little Russell’s Reserve, a little Whiskey Del Bac Dorado, and I finished his experience with a pour of Ugi. The look of pure bliss on his face as he drank it sums up how good this malt is, and it will always have a place on my shelf. Cheers!"

4.0,"Appearance: Clover honey is the color, and thin viscous legs cling to the glass.

Nose: The nose in this scotch is delicious, but different from anything I’ve ever smelled in a whisk(e)y. It starts off floral and sweet with lychee fruit and maple, followed by more rugged peaty smoke, sawdust, dry hay, burning rubber, and strangely the smells of a Hobby Lobby craft store and cooked broccoli. 

Taste: There is an initial heat in the beginning, then after acclimation, notes of honey, salty brine, peat, strawberries, and a sweeter-side red wine.

Finish: The finish is moderate and has a fruity wine aftertaste.

Thoughts: This scotch was really good, and I would recommend others to at least try it, but coming off the heels of the last Ardbeg I tried, this one, to my tastes, is inferior. I liked that it threw me for a loop at times but it wasn’t as flavorful as I think it could have been, which is weird because Ardbeg did a great job at keeping it at an honest flavorful proof. It is still very good, but the Corryvreckan is currently my favorite. Thanks again, Ardbeg! Sláinte!"

4.5,"FInally bought this here in PA. Have tried a lot of not-Uigeadail Ardbeg and loved all of them for various reasons, especially Corryvreckan. This one takes the cake for spice compared to many a whisky/whiskey a whole lot higher in ABV. There seems to be no way to avoid burning the back of my throat and tongue no matter how I drink it. The peat is downright juicy, which for peat lovers is very nice. The sweet is just right and the smokey/meaty is not in the same vein as Corry, Laga D.E., Laga 16yr., or Laphroaig anything. This is less like ham or brisket for me and more like a Slim Jim or Jerky that's peat smoked. It's a different flavor there I really cannot truly describe so I should stop trying. 

The thing I love most about drinking great Scotches is the full in- your-face experience they usually render. Sure I'm not alone in this. Guess I'll never understand how burnt rubber, iodine, sea salt, seaweed, kippers, smoked ham and  something sweet thrown in, work together to satisfy the thirst, the craving, the willingness to part with hard-earned money for this kind of taste. Human beings are a funny lot. 

$82.99 formerly $100 here in PA. Didn't have a sale sticker so maybe there's finally been a lasting price change at the PLCB stores. Can I get an Amen, somebody?"

4.5,"Bacon fat. Peat. Truffle. 

Best enjoyed with a bold cigar on a cold winter night. It's a brilliant dram for the peat lover and without much provocation reminds its drinker of newly smoked brisket. One cannot idly sip, Uigeadail demands your full attention."
4.5,"Nose: Peat ofc., with a hay-like quality. Like smoldering wet hay. I mean this in a nice way. The peat is neatly balanced by a definite but not overpowering fruity sweetness (both citrus and darker fruits). There is also black pepper notes that borders to salty, sweet licorice. 

Palate: Intense. The hay and pepper carries over to the palate. The peat is less ”wet” than on the nose - it’s more bonfire-like smoke. The smoke blends well with the fruity sweetness (again, not just sherry-typical ”dark” fruits, but also citrus) resulting in a spicy bacon like tone (like bacon snacks). 

Finish: Long. Salty licorice, pepper, sweet bacon, and a long lingering firey smoke, almost like burned black bitter toast, or ash even (would in my opinion have benefited from being slightly less so). 

Overall: Few whiskies I tried are so thick with flavours as this one. It really taste A LOT. Still, it’s well balanced and the flavours come together beautifully, which is impressive for such a vibrant and relatively young (one must assume 10yo or less?) whisky.

4.5 it is, being a bit on the generous side, but it deserves it! This one is a must try for any fan of peated whisky."

4.5,"This review is for a bottle from 2016.

“You cannot keep a good expression down” should be the theme for Ardbeg Uigeadail.  The last bottle I finished was from 2016, and 2016 was still an amazingly good time; much better than the Dark Cove released the same year.  Ardbeg Uigeadail has been decreasing in price every year, going against the trend for Scotch, because the amount of quality sherry cask influence decreases every year.  Meanwhile, Ardbeg has yearly special releases that invariably fail to be better than the Uigeadail despite the obvious attempts by Ardbeg to cheapen and worsen the Uigeadail, year after year.  I’m sorry, but your overpriced yearly NAS specials still cannot beat your core masterpiece.

As of 2016, I can tell you that the Uigeadail is still an amazing whisky.  The dustier the bottle that you can find on the shelves, the better.  I will pay over $500 for bottles before 2011.  When I think of a combination of peat and sherry, there is no better example than an old Uigeadail.  This is buttery, sweet, salty, and I always get the taste of charred lobster shells, which is a mindblowing note from a whisky.  I hope the note will persist in more recent renditions of the Uigeadail, but I am not sure.

Score: ** (unimaginably good)

How much do I think a bottle is worth: $150"

Creamy succulent mouthfeel brings assault of smokey malt, salt cured meat, rich chocolate dipped fruit, ground dark roast coffee bean fading to oily sweet char.This is a nuclear weapon of flavor going off in your mouth. The richness and intensity is amazing! Looooong lasting finish of smoke, sweet malt, salted bacon fat and non drying char. Juicy mouthwatering smoke laced goodness.

Smoked maple bacon with dates on entry, then transitions to young unlit cigar and saltwater, then finishes as mocha mixed with toasted malt.

Wonderfully balanced, and intriguingly complex.  Nearly perfect.

The character changed during the course of three months the bottle lasted, albeit not the degree of Corryvreckan.  However, like the Corryvreckan, the smoke mellowed, and the sweetness deepened.  The rougher edges smoothed out.  This is perhaps the only whisky I've known to get better with light oxidation.

It has come to my attention that batch quality has been erratic.  This was my first tasting of Uigeadail, and I cannot speak for batches made 5+ years ago, but this one was a keeper."

The nose and mouth show the light floral nature of the distillate, but it is wrapped and enveloped in a heavy blanket of peat smoke. If you are in to fairly peated, this is a rather sophisticated version for your enjoyment."

4.5,"A surprise from first to last, and a delight throughout. A sticky, oily, almost airplane-glue like nose -- imagine a chemical fire in the bazooka bubblegum factory, starting where the old mimeograph machines were stored -- leads to a luscious, vibrant, smoky, charred taste, with elements of vanilla, dark chocolate, cinnamon, charred rum-dipped cherries, and an almost novocaine numb-buzz on the top of the mouth (which will stay with you well after your last sip). An exotic and extremely attractive whiskey, full of seduction, smoke, and fire; in many ways it reminds me of my first experience with opium, absinthe, and krautrock, a mixture of heat and sweetness and just plain decadence. Highly recommended. Oh -- if you want to slightly mute the pronounced Technicolor Dream affect you may experience from this fine and unique whiskey, I strongly suggest throwing in a chip of ice or two (say, a dime-sized cube). This will allow you to enjoy the rare, powerful but sweet peat, flavor, and smoke without having to worry too much about the surprisingly rapid and somewhat disorienting head buzz even small doses of this whiskey may engender when taken neat."

3.75,"Apparently this is mostly Ardbeg 10 with only a small percentage of this being sherry casks. Crazy how just that small amount completely changes the character of this whiskey. I’m reviewing this with a little water added, since imo it’s just better that way.

Nose: The Ardbeg peat jumps out, pretty ashy. Strawberry jam and vanilla come out too, along with a tiny bit of honey malt sweetness.

Palate: The malt sweetness shines much more than on the nose (reminds me of sucralose, which I personally don’t like). But the savory sweetness of the heavy peat and the sherry casks combine to balance it out. Another review described it as “bacon jam,” and I guess that’s accurate enough. Adding water tampers the ash and brings out the fruit.

Finish: The finish lingers for a while, if only because the flavors are so strong. Medium bodied and medium oiliness.

I’d say the ashiness of the peat, the sweetness of the malt, and the strength of all the flavors combined are just too much for me. The Uigeadail is pretty complex, but it’s not relaxing or comforting in the least. Tasting it is more of an intellectual undertaking than anything."

Treacle. Bacon. Bonfires.

That's what is printed on the bottle. How appropriate. Couldn't have said it better myself. I've said it before, there's no bad Ardbeg, just good Ardbeg and better Ardbeg. As is sipped on the last remnants of this bottle I tried to think of anything that wasn't great about this bottle. It's so popular on this platform and raved about by whisky reviewers around the world. Surely it can't live up to the hype. As I kept sipping, I for once couldn't come up with anything. Peat? Yep. Sherry? Yep. Good ABV? Yep. 

This may perhaps be a rare example of a bottle getting better as you get to the bottom. At the risk of cheapening the five-star review, I'm sending one out here. I've even gone so far as to adjust past five-star reviews I've given (in this case lowering them) to reflect my current opinions about those pours, and to illustrate just how good this one is. It maintained its integrity from neck pour to bottle kill, and quite honestly, was a steel at the price I paid for it. While Talisker will always have my heart as my top peated  dram, Ardbeg remains a fond friend and close confidant. Cheers!"

Honey, brown bread or fruit cake, raisins. Oh-so-subtle sweetness with winter/Christmas spices to balance some of the puff, which continues throughout. Exhale light smoke, sherry tang, black liquorice. It's thick, chewy, and oily throughout. It's up there with LV16 for depth of flavor and hidden flavors each time I have it so I'm excited to sip it again. As a lover of Islay, very happy with this one. The sherry influence is spot on and adds to the deep, rich smokiness by cutting it with some bright, fruit notes. Reasonably priced just below $80. This is in my top 2 of bottles right now I think.

5.0,"This is, 
Without a doubt,
The best peaty whisky i have ever had.

Should i end the review right there? I should but i wont. I need people to read this, to discover it (it is actually part of the core range of ardbeg)  and to buy it.

I just called all my whisky lovers friends, and told them to get it.

Lets start with the basics. 54.2% abv, amber color. 

On the nose is the perfect dram. It has every freaking aroma there is in any aroma chart: Peat. English sauce. Cream vanilla. Prunes. There is a beautiful balance between sweet and peat. Toffee. Bread. Wet vanilla cake, actually Banana bread but not banana.
After a while, earthy peat, you can smell the mud mixed with the not-decomposed plants. Citric notes in small puffs.
I wanted to give it a 24 at the beggining, but because of how complex it is, i got to give it a 25/25.
It is absolutely overwhelming. Complex. Changing. Superb. Much better aroma than any other ardbeg i have had. Incredible.
After more minutes, bonfire. Cake burnt. 
Hard dulce de leche. Even sherry and frozen red fruits after 20 mins. Or am i crazy? (Actually im not, i just read it has a sherry maturation).

On the palate is also incredible. Pepper, Toffee, Ashy, Smoky, Sweet.
Superb full mouth sensation. Very pleasant and full of flavor. Some sherriness present. Wow. Meat is also present.

Aftertaste is magnificent. Smoke, Ashes, Mint, Ginger. It is eternal. More Ginger and a dim English sauce in the back.

Overall i think this is one of my top 5 whiskies ever, (from this point on) dont be like me and wait this long to try it, buy it, IT IS NOT EXPENSIVE which makes it even more fantastic. I feel that i can now conquer the world, 100 over 100 is my score.

Great nose. Absolutely love the dark roasted coffee, it’s almost unmistakable. The palate is unfortunately overpowered by ash, which I was hoping wouldn’t be the case.

The palate will surprise you with what seems like a weak start then as you swirl and chew, the great complexity of a true Islay abounds! Citrus is the first note with grapefruit, lemon-lime and tart apple. The peat comes up next but not with the punch that hit you on the nose. The peat on the palate is subtle yet complex. Brings back campfires during hikes on the Appalachia’s and the salty briny beaches of Corolla! The finish is long and strong for a scotch probably due to the higher than norm 108.4 proof. Fantastic Islay!"
5.0,"It's hard to call yourself a peat-head if you've yet to review this one. It's about damn time I got around to it. This is one of the two high-octane releases in Ardbeg's core range (along with the Corry). It's one of the most highly-touted whiskies from Islay's holy trinity. Let's get into it.

Nose: Big peat, big smoke. Campfire smoke, iodine, and a touch of band-aid. @Generously_Paul told me to look for a tennis ball note in Laphroaig. I've yet to test that with a Laphroaig, but I do find that in this one. There's also sea salt and brine. Lemon and grapefruit citrus. Black pepper spice. Creamy custard notes. Some smoked meat. Vanilla, berries, and roasted chestnuts. Small bit of sulphur and tar. I'm not going to try to guess which flower, but I'm getting April flowers. If I didn't stop here, I don't know that I ever would. Stunning nose.

Palate: Peat, campfire smoke, iodine, sea salt, sulfur, and brine. Classic Islay. Lemon, lime, and grapefruit. Beacon and brisket, maybe some ribs. Loving the char. The sherry is in full force here. Double chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream. With a cherry on top. Some of the dry red fruits on the mid-palate. Sherry-cask aging manifests very differently in peated whiskies, and it's absolutely amazing when the two are working in tandem. As is the case here. Black pepper, cinnamon, and some heavy-hitting chili. Honey, graham cracker, and marshmallow. Once again, I feel like I'm missing a lot, but it should suffice to say that I'm very impressed.

Finish: Beast of a finish. Starts off with some residual sulfur and band-aid notes. A bit of dried fruit takes the forefront before the black pepper, cinnamon, and oak notes take over to deliver the tail end of a very long finish.

5/5. I could cut this review right here, but I'll say a couple quick things. This is one of the best peated whiskies I've ever had. One of the most complex. Easily one of the best VFM purchases.

And, like Laphroaig Lore, Oogie embodies the true spirit of whisky. It has a bit of everything a die-hard whisky fanatic could hope to find a single bottling. Heavily-peated, near-cask strength, bourbon and sherry barrel aging. And the sum is much greater than the parts.

Up next is the Corryvreckan. Between the two, I've had a terribly difficult time deciding which I prefer. So when it's time to write that review, I'll reveal my choice. But for the time being, I'll conclude that this is simply amazing juice. Hell of a job, Ardbeg, here's to you."

4.25,"Long awaited dram. Excited to try this out. I was not that big a fan of the AnOa.

Nose: initial smell is the iodine/ medicinal smell. It’s got this sweet citrus dried fruit smell in the mid. This mint/black licorice end. Further away from the nose, I get a light fruit citrus smell.

Taste: Don’t know if I’m so used to the smoke, but I don’t get a lot of smoke flavor which is alright. The initial flavor is a sweet dried fruit. I get a lot of char oak in the mid flavor. Some spice and black pepper. I do get an iodine/ rubbery/ band aid taste as well. Not a bad taste. I’ve let it sit on my tongue for a while.

Mouthfeel: you definitely feel the 54% abv hit you. You get a spice through the sip, and a lightspeed of flavor as it travels to the back of your throat. Like mint, it gives you this cooling effect when you breathe in. The finish is dry. 

Did not disappoint. Definitely one I enjoyed the tasting of. A lot to discovers excited to try this again."

4.75,"Nose - strong, peaty campfire smoke and smoldering ash, burning rubber, iodine, charred meat, tennis balls (ripped this off another review, but it’s totally there), pear, plum, grape, moderate ethanol burn.

Taste - peaty campfire smoke and ash, pear, peach, plum, raisins, dark chocolate, peanuts, rich salted caramel, dense spiced vanilla, moderate ethanol burn, finishing long with beautiful smoky, salty chocolate and rich peanut and vanilla flavors.

It’s amazing. At first, I thought it was too smoke-heavy, obscuring the more nuanced flavors, but give it 20 minutes or so to off-gas and it really opens up to showcase the deep fruitiness and rich, savory flavors hiding beneath the fire. It’s like standing around a bonfire, roasting s’mores, drinking peach tea, and watching a beautiful lowcountry sun set over the May River."

4.25,"This expression has been on my bar for about a year and I've enjoyed many trips to this bottling.  The pour is a burnished yellow-gold.  Full sheeting on a swirl with a few low tears marking this wisky's path back to the bottom of the glencairn.

On the nose this is pure Islay.  Iodine and band-aids, new yellow rubber boots and barbeque smoke, brine and succulents, malt and peat, floral and sweet.  Helen Keller said that smell is a potent wizard that transports you across thousands of miles.  The nose of this whisky proves her observaton right.  My nose has taken my imagination on an adventure in the bowl of this tasting glass.  Simply magnificent!

The taste is one of roasted meaty, smoky tobacco over a salty, honey-dipped drop of silky...  Okay, that's a bit much.   Am I being over enthusiastic? 

I like Islay scotches.  By way of an example, I give you Lagavulin 16 and Laphroaig 10. The Lagavulin is a near perfect sip for me while Laphroaig doesn't cut it.  The Laphroaig is lacking subtlety, in my opinion.  It's brash and made up, like a trashy tart in a cheap bar.  The Lagavulin fascinates me, like a mysterious contessa in her best evening garb.  

But the Ardbeg, well that's the gal I'd most like to bring home.  Plenty of complexity balanced with a bouncy nature that just says ""drink me"".  

I like this whisky a lot.  I ask you to pardon my exuburance, you've read the review thus far so I'll just cut to the chase.  This is a 4 star whisky.  It's a full bodied Islay of near ideal proportions and, at 108.4 proof and non-chill filtered, this just ticks the boxes for me one after another.  

I hope I never run out."

4.75,"One reviewer here at Distiller.com described the Ardbeg Uigeadail as ""bacon jam"".  I wholeheartedly agree.  The peat smoke combined with the sherried complexity, creates a meaty savoriness.  If you don't like BBQ, you can picture this as rich, pipe tobacco followed by sherried fruitiness and spice.  The 54% ABV layers intensity onto the finish, but not the initial palate.  This is easily my favorite expression from Ardbeg.  I will never go without a bottle of this on my shelf.

Note: This is not a beginner's whisky.  If you aren't familiar with peated scotches, this will taste like smoke, smoke and more smoke.  But once you're past that, the Oogie is the one ring to rule them all.

3.5,"Upon blind tasting, realized it has little nose"
4.5,"Whoa. After a month of owning the bottle, tried it with a bit of purified water. 

The nose now has a lot of beef jerky like smells, smoked meats. 

The taste got aggressive with tobacco smoke being the biggest new flavor that comes through. It’s like I took a puff of a cigar at the beach and the residual flavor of smoke stays in the mouth. It’s still got a lot of kick to it. And the sweet flavors get muted. I enjoy this dram a ton. Very interesting how the whisky changed."

4.0,"Very tasty. A sweeter version of Corryvreckan with softer peat. Think a smoky raisin nose with a sherry berry oily mouthfeel and a sweet soft lingering burn on the finish.

My scale:

1- Freshman year on campus stock
2- Senior year off campus stock
3- First year out of college stock
4- Now we’re talking 
5- I’d rather just look at it than drink it

You can fill in the in-between a as you could imagine."

4.25,"Seashells, ash, rubber and raspberry jam on the nose. On first sip a wall of spicy fruit hits which quickly gives way to smoke and a musty, sweet peat.

Needs a good few drops of water to really open up, and when it does its glorious. The closest thing in the Ardbeg lineup to Lagavulin 16."

4.75,"I purchased this on sale for $74.95 back in November 2019 when I turned in my dissertation, but I've listed the current price below. I wanted something special and had been hearing a lot about the cask strength Ardbeg's that quietly wait on the shelves. My experience with Islay was limited but promising, and this was clearly a step up in weight class.

I get a standard Islay peat on the nose, but not as strong as Ardbeg 10. It is balanced by brine and fruit. The fresh fruit jumps out, like you are walking through an orchard or farmer's market. I get apples, orange peel, and dark fruits balanced by a light sweetness. I know most people would say butterscotch or honey, but this reminds me of agave as well. It is rich without being overpowering.

The peat is still tempered on the palate. It's there but it doesn't smack you around like the 10Y Islays. Unlike the classic 10Y, I get much more fruit and sweetness on the palate from the sherry cask. It is wonderful. The fruit continues on the finish, and finally the peat and ethanol come out to play. 

This is probably my favorite Scotch I've had, and my issue has been with its drinkability and price. It is so damn good but also expensive, so I've taken 6 months to finish it instead of 1. Not a big deal obviously, but buyer beware, this is an easy bottle to kill if you don't show some restraint."

4.5,"Tasted neat.

Nose is classic Ardbeg, a little rounded and not as in your face like 10 but the peat is till there. Brine, beef jerky, sweet BBQ ribs, some candied fruit along with some typical medicinal Islay notes

First sip is robust for lack of a better word and will definitely awake your senses. On the second sip I got some fruit jam which quickly goes away to make way for peat, tobacco, cigar ash all beautifully done. It has a great mouth feel, a bit chewy. 

Finish is quiet long and finishes with some white pepper/ ash-tray.

All and all this is a fantastic single malt. I was a bit afraid before getting a bottle since some reviews mentioned the peat being muted. However it is in my humble opinion that that is not the case, the sherry cask only adds to its complexity but the classic Ardbeg peat is still the star of the show. For a bit less than 100 dollars I will keep this as a special occasion scotch and will enjoy for years to come."
4.75,"Smokey, salty, complex, rich and balanced. Fantastic on the nose and palate. Taste it!"
5.0,Ok so Ive already reviewed this. Just wanted to post bottle kill(no need to like- just comments if you want). Ive been going back to back with Laphroaig Lore. Weep for me as both bottles are now gone. Im hedging my bet to this over the Lore though both are fabulous. Thing is I  drink the whole bottle not just a sample so I can get multiple impressions. No its not around long enough for oxidation to do much but nonetheless from an unashamed drinkers perspective this edges the Lore. It will come down to preference  as usual  but this is 20-50 less$... you decide

3.0,"Nose: pineapple, candle wax, a very fruity peat, a bid sour and all quiet mild, strawberry

Palate: eyebrow raising interesting, rough leather, minerals / stone, black pepper heat, charcoal

Water doesn’t do much except removed parts of the fresh fruitiness from the nose. The aftertaste after a medium long finish is sour apple cider for a really long time. 

It is indeed very interesting. It has a typical NAS harshness but that’s not really bothering. I think the strong suit of this whisky is the contradicting unity of nose and palate. It is completely different from each other but in combination works really great together. You know, like salt & caramel, walnuts & honey or cream cheese & jam or vanilla ice cream & juniper with basil. Really a nice little experience. I’m glad I tried this sample but wouldn’t go for a full bottle because it is to rough and burny for my taste.  I could imagine older Ardbegs being more my thing because I enjoy smoother whisky with a peat side to it the most. I heard good things about independent Ardbeg bottlings which I think will have an eye on. 

I rate this unpronounceable whisky 2.8 because of a nice taste but a really great and interesting experience."

4.0,"My first Peated whisky was Johnnie Walker Double black and that was full on Campfire on the nose. I was expecting and bracing myself for it but, on the nose I got a brand new DOCs smell with milk chocolate. The taste was a sweet black cherry and the finish was short and a noticeable spice. (Not too much or barely enough but, definitely there.) Glad I bought this. I'll be buying this again."
4.75,"Such a lovely representation of Isaly Scotch. Noses with peat, sea salt air, and butterscotch. Tastes of idodine and like smoke balance with an oiley finish. There is a slight dried fruit floral taste underneath the whiskey."
3.5,A rich medly of flavors with a strong taste of tobacco from the peat. Fruity and sweet at the beginning before it gives way to coffee and finally tobacco on the finish. Better than the 10 or an oa.

4.5,"This is a very smoky, complex, but overall incredibly balanced whiskey. I added a few drops of water to cut down the high ABV, and it’s still strong. The nose is very peaty, but with the typical Ardbeg sweetness there as well. The sherry notes become heavy on the first taste, and there are some sweet fruity flavors as well. The finish is nice with very little burn considering the ABV."
4.75,"Color: Deep Gold, very slow long legs - oily

Nose: Leather and Tobacco. Iodine and sea air. Massive amounts of peat and smoked meat, with raisins and dark chocolate in the background.

Palate: An initial wave of burnt caramel. The same leather and tobacco notes from the nose, along with sweet fruits and wine soaked raisins on the edges. Cocoa powder, cream, and nuts by the mid palate.

Finish: Reminiscent of a bonfire on the beach. The sweet fruits are contrasted with the salty sea air and the burning wood from the fire. A finish that lingers longer than most, fully in control of your senses.

Overall: Ardbeg Uigeadail is an experience to say the very least. The richness of the nose is paralleled only by the depth of its flavor. Layers of peat and sweet slowly unravel with every sip, welcoming the idea of a second glass. This is one I’ll be coming back to soon, eager to learn more.

5.0,"Finally I get to taste it...
Nose: roasted honey ham, walnuts, sticky toffee pudding, slightly into band-aid, orange peel
Palate: very savoury but with some sweetness. Lots of chocolate and coffee beans, burnt rubber/tar, dates, toffee pudding
It is oily, with oak notes, very long finish and the alcohol does add up to it's overall dimension. 

It's a tough call to decide if I prefer the Oogie over the Corry... I guess it will depend on the mood. Oogie is sweeter to my taste. Bother are too shelf anyway"

3.5,"Nose: Bacon or salted ham was apparent first on the nose. Easy to catch a slight burn on the nose due to the high proof. Tobacco coming through and light cocoa powder. The hue is caramel more than the reddish hue I tend to attach to sherry influenced whisky. Definitely what I’d describe as rich in hue and nose. Like Lagavulin 16 without that - Ooo this is obviously Lagavulin profile. I catch just a hint of a light crisp fruit but the oily smoke scent is much more pronounced. After a few more takes at it, it reminds me of spiced venison sticks. I think this would pair well with salty crackers and salami.

Taste: On first sip, my taste buds need to burn and get adjusted to the heat of the proof. Not terrible oily but distinctly Islay as can be expected. Powerful, bold smoke and apparent salted meat. 

3 drops of water: Sweetness is more apparent. Maybe oranges? But that’s a bit of a stretch. Not quite as hot but still quite the punch.

15ish drops: At this point it’s cloudy, but closer to the typical proof I tend to drink no doubt. Additional notes aren’t jumping out. Proof still grows through the finish.

Finish: Grows in aggressiveness. It’s a bold dram. Not terribly complex. Give it a minute and some subtle sweetness peaks it’s way into the finish. Oiliness a bit more noticeable as the mouth and throat processes the resolution of the tasting."
