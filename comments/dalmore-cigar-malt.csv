5.0,"Note for the new Reserve: Fruity and rich, with notes of figs and mulled cider, a smooth caramel taste that surprises after a strong and complex nose. A crisp sherry-flavored finish."

4.0,"Tasted 8/23/[email protected] Rod N Reel : Enjoying with family in Chesapeake Beach, Maryland. Nose of sweet maple syrup on pancakes.  Light and smooth on the palate with mild burn. Maple-honey sweetness and vanilla all around.  Finish is wonderfully long.  Well balanced. Perfect with friends on a cool, crisp fall day.  Just wish I had a cigar with me."

3.75,87.  This scotch will put hair on your chest - male or female!  Nose is deceiving. Smells of honey and light pepper.  Bites your tongue right above the middle.  Wonderful taste...make sure to let it dwell in your mouth.  Has a hint of bitters on the finish.

5.0,LOTS of brown sugar and sherry on the nose. Absolute sherry bomb. Lots of lingering spice and oak underneath the sherry. Really effing good.

1.0,"Not sure why some whiskeys suck butt, but this one did for me. Perhaps wet tobacco notes remind me of licking an ashtray? Either way, this one ruined Dalmore for me."

4.0,"This is a beautiful pour, coating the glass with long slow legs.  Thick applesauce and rootbeer on the nose, with honey, berries and citrus. And maybe a bit of tobacco. The oiliness on the glass becomes sweet oiliness in the mouth with a mild suggestion of smoke, coffee and tobacco. Water adds vanilla and oak to the nose, lightens the palate and sneaks in some anise. The dry glass is redolent with butterscoth and blood orange. Put all this with a gorgeous dark amber color, and you have a mighty nice whisky. Thanks Pranay!"

4.0,"Big bold malty flavor, sweet on the finish, really the perfect pairing to cut through the smoke of a good cigar."
4.0,wow. I mistakenly identified this as a sweet bourbon. the sweetest Scotch I've experienced. Enjoyed it though. I like the diversity Scotland is able to bring to the scene.

4.5,"★★★★½
Avent 2019 - 18/24.
Ce whisky est tout simplement dans ma palette. Une belle puissance digne des Oilers d'Edmonton des années '80 qui nous éblouissent tant ils sont bons et beaux à voir jouer. Ce Dalmore, malgré son prix élevé, sait répondre aux besoins insistants d'un homme qui a passé un automne sombre et sinistre."
