Remarks
This my friends is a great buy for a bourbon whiskey small batch It has a uniqueness that is difficult to taste through. All the different flavors it has lends to great complexity... there's wood, there's nuts, there's caramel, there's honey! Overall a delectable beverage! Drink it neat or on the rocks I'm sure slight bit of water would add a little bit to its flavor profile. Without carrying on this is a very, very enjoyable beverage!
Be Kind, Be Generous, Be Real, Be Responsible!!!

2.5,"This is a very unusual bourbon. Smell is sweet and not very strong. The color is very very light, almost like I had just poured a light beer and not a bourbon. The taste is sweet and that is about it. Not complex at all but that is not necessarily a bad thing. I poured a couple glasses neat and thought sweet, smooth and boring both pours.  Price was right at 20$ so cannot complain too much."

2.0,Seemed a bit harsh at first taste. I usually like an edge. Not my favorite. Price was nice. Probably better with a mix. Smooth middle and no aftertaste if that makes any sense.
2.25,Meh.. it’s better with ice.
