4.75,Deep brown color with a noticeable sherry/port nose. Immediate flavors of caramel and oak leading into a subtle anise spicy smoothness. Silky on the tongue with the slightest hint of brown sugar.
5.0,"The nose is smooth and floral, with licorice, caramel, oak and anise. The palate is rich and mouth coating with brown sugar, oak, buttery custard, baking spices, all perfectly balanced and deep. The finish is long with a slowly fading buttery oakiness, along with baking spices and brown sugar underneath. Truly amazing."
