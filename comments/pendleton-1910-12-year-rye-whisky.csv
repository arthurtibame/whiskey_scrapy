2.0,"100% rye from Alberta Distillers, but not a ""straight"" rye. The Alberta provenance is apparent on the nose, which is nice, but the taste and finish are a mix of nauseating sweet pancake syrup and bitter wood. Not worth your time."

4.0,"Vanilla and marshmallow, smoother than it leads."
4.0,Lots of vanilla on the nose. Smells hot but is very smooth with sweet vanilla and toffee notes. Caramel as well. Really tasty but much sweeter than most ryes so it won't be for everyone.

4.75,"This is a wonderful whiskey on the market. Every time I have a huge bourbon drinker taste this before I tell them its a Canadian whiskey they love the taste. We had a taste test the other night with Four Roses, Old Forrester, Elmer T. Lee and some others. Elmer of course came in first but the 1910 was a close second. This is worth a try and the bottle is cool."

3.0,"Very sweet easy drinking rye, but doesn’t have a lot of the complexity and spice that I expect from a rye. If this was bottled at a higher proof, it would probably improve it a lot for me. As it is, I can see new whiskey drinkers liking this a lot since it’s such an easy drinker. Given its low price and age, I’ll give it a score of 3, but that’s probably a little generous."
3.75,"Orange, vanilla, honey and baking spices.  Vanilla, oak, orange marmalade with spicy baking spice notes. Finishes warm and spicy. Nice Canadian rye."

2.5,"Nose: leather, vanilla.
Palate: orange, woody, cinnamon, tannins. Finish is medium length and spicy.
Adding water balances the nose with a twist of cinnamon, and sweetens the palate a bit.
Overall: descent, but imperfect. Seems like it would make a good mixer (e.g. would pop well in an old fashioned, I think)."

2.5,"Nose is sweet vanilla and dried dark fruit, some tobacco. Palate is dense oil and sickly sweet vanilla. Think vanilla extract almost. Finish has cherry that quickly fades to a strange bitter medicinal note. A good qaulity whiskey but the overly sweet cherry and vanilla is not to my taste. Saving it for my wife who likes the Sweet notes."
4.0,So choclately but I love a Canadian whisky. Not what I expected from a rye.
4.25,"I am blown away by the smoothness of this rye. Perhaps it’s the lack of the spicy bite most folks are missing, but this lovely brown sauce seems a bit underrated in my uneducated opinion."

3.75,"An excellent, smooth example of how Rye can be sipped and enjoyed the same as Scotch and Bourbon.  Sweet vanilla carries this bottle through with slight caramel and nuttiness.  A little pepper on the finish balances this out nicely.  However, more a desert drink than anything else.  While not a traditional Rye, at the price, there's no reason to pass on it."

2.25,"Pretty disappointed in this rye. I was expecting a bit more from the spirit after reading the reviews. Complete lack of spice that I’ve come to expect from a rye. Instead there is an overpowering taste of vanilla. Almost such that it’s like drinking diluted vanilla extract.

This will hardly hold up as the sole whiskey in a Manhattan, so I’ve been forced to add other superior eyes (high west’s double rye for instance) into the cocktail to make it tolerable.

This won’t have a permanent spot on my shelf."

Well the original Pendleton is not good at all and hardly tastes like a whisky. With the 12 year it’s definitely better, but that isn’t saying much. You get a nice oak smell on the nose , but it gets lost once it hits your pallet. For probably the same price you can get a bottle of Lot 40 Canadian Rye and it would be a much better pour."
