5.0,"This sweet nectar of the gods is all you need for a post-work (or pre, no judgment here) cooldown. Drink it neat or throw it on the rocks, but drink it.

This stuff blows Maker's Mark outta the water and the distillery is a hidden gem. Support the crap outta them, and get the first Straight Bourbon Whiskey made in Illinois in close to half a century."

They're clearly going for a more traditional austere bourbon to contrast everyone else's, and their own, young, barrel forward whiskeys (which I like too)."
