3.75,"It’s been a while since I sat and tasted (drank, for sure, but not tasted).  Amassed quite a bit of samples that I really need to work.  Starting the long weekend with this sample provided by @dubz480 and one that I have been looking forward to as I like Speyburn: affordable, decent taste and quality and relatively accessible. 

The color is light golden yellow, similar to Golden Raisins. 

A fruity nose starts the journey with a mix of orchard and dark fruits.  Apples and pears with plumbs, raisins, black cherries.  A walnut or pecan quality exists faintly in the background.  As more time passed, the nose sweetens with butterscotch and milk chocolate with a sprinkle of lemon zest.  Soft and sweet. 

It arrives soft, spicy, sweet almost simultaneously.  The softness is as silky and creamy in a medium body.   Ground cinnamon and ginger provide the spiciness.  The sweetness comes in the flavors of fruits: Concord grapes, applesauce, vanilla, butterscotch 

The finish is drying and slightly oaky with lemon oil, grape skin and a sprinkle of cocoa powder all lasting a fair length. 

A dram with a good aroma, subtle sweetness and spiciness that is inoffensive, enjoyable yet complex enough sip and enjoy slowly.  Maybe even as a summer sipper. Thanks @dubz480 I will seek this one out.  [87/100][Tasted: 5/24/19]"
4.25,"For part 2 of my Single Malt finds of the week (Dark Origins being part one) I managed to find this one marked down to $37.97! For that I am getting a Speyside Single Malt age stated at 15 yrs old, non chill filtered and bottled at 46% abv. Yes please! It also helped that I quite enjoyed the Companion Cask I had recently purchased and felt that some Sherry influence on that one would go a long way (which this offering does indeed feature).
According to the Distillery this is a fairly limited offering (only 3,500 cases made available worldwide per annum) that is aged for 15 yrs in ex Bourbon barrels (assuming it's also sourced from Buffalo Trace as the Companion Cask was) and then finished in ex Sherry Casks for an undisclosed amount of time. It's SRP is $69.99 which is pretty darn reasonable for a 15 yr old Speyside single malt. On to the tasting!
On the pallette the initial entry is soft and creamy with toffee, orange peel and cinnamon baked apples. Mid pallette brings in some leather, baking spices (predominantly cinnamon) and some dark dried fruits. Finish is just over a medium length that starts with cocoa and leaves with vanilla and that orange peel note. The orange zest lingers long after the sip of the dram. 
This is a really well constructed and balanced Whiskey. Unlike most Speyside's I have had, the Sherry is in the background and the Bourbon cask is on full display which makes this one different in a good way. 
Even at SRP it's a solid value (let alone the price paid). 
Will it blow you away? No.
Will it make you want to come back again and again? Absolutely!
Should you buy a bottle? For $65 or less absolutely! Especially if you like Bourbon or a heavy Bourbon influence on Whiskey. 
Anyone looking for a strong Sherry influence should pass even at this price point as this probably won't hit your profile. 
Big credit to Speyburn for putting out a high quality product at relative value pricing! 
Happy Hump Day all and Cheers!"

3.75,"Heavy orange nose
Surprising spicy pallate, with an (orange?) sidenote.
relatively smooth finish"
4.25,"Nose: very lush and fruity with green apples, coconut, citrus, pineapple, with just a bit of woody tannin.

Palate: More assertive with darker richer flavors like cocoa, cider, black pepper, allspice, a little roasty bitterness, and more of the wood.

Finish: fairly short, and dominated by the drier notes.

Comparable to Loch Lomond 12 but more grown up and complex."

3.5,"The smell is enveloped by a strong sherried personality, with a lot of cinnamon, cloves, lemon, ripe banana, honey, vanilla. Turf in the background, with a slightly shameless alcoholic tip. Simple and all in all anonymous.
And alcohol remains cheeky even on the palate, boasting from the bottom of its 46%, with the amplified herbaceous profile that accompanies the nose impressions. Ripe fruit and vanilla, apples cooked with cinnamon, honey, a pinch of citrus and an impression of chocolate. In the end, it is the cinnamon that dominates the aromas, lashed by the invasiveness of alcohol, making everything rather monotonous.
Fairly short finish, of (strangely!) cinnamon, alcohol, caramel, lemon."
