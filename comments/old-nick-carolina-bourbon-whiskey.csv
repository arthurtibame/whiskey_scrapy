3.5,A little hot up front but it tapers down nicely leaving a district oak flavor with a hint of smoke.

2.0,"Young and hot.  This is not a bad bottle but not worth the $35 in NC.  These folks run a nice distillery in the Greater Winston Salem NC area.  They are trying hard to put out a quality product.  Please go by and visit, tour and taste.  They also make trips around the state signing bottles and speaking with customers!  

The heat is strong all the way through and it dampens the flavors that might be hiding.  Other than some astringent notes and heavy alcohol, I could not detect anything bad. This reminds me of the freshman girl I left behind in high school when I went off to college.  She was hot and had real promise...just a bit too young for me at the time.  If these guys can manage to stay in business for a few more years, they might have some good offerings for the region.  Think New Riff."
3.5,Super hot from the beginning through to the end. Very rich in flavor but goes away quickly. If it had less heat and lasted longer it’d be great!
4.5,My go to. Never fails. It's the base of my infinity bottle

4.0,"Made in NC from a wheated mash bill. You get typical corn sweetness, butterscotch, caramel, lots of oak. Thick and clingy mouthfeel. This is surprisingly good considering the age. You can tell that this is young, but every batch gets better. The quality is definitely there."
