4.0,"As a lover of Talisker and cask-strength drams, 57' North is my kind of whisky. It's hot, but it hides it's alcohol content well enough that it's still quite drinkable neat. Interestingly enough, the smoke and dried fruit here are much more restrained when compared to the Ten Year; instead this whisky plays up it's honey and brine notes—finishing up with just a kiss of peat smoke (water definitely helps to bring that flavor out, though) on the finish. A very good, if relatively straightforward whisky."

4.0,"I feel as if Talisker can’t do me any wrong.  There’s maybe just 3-4 distilleries that I’ve consistently given either a 4 or 5 across their portfolio.  Talisker is one of them, along with Kilchoman, Springbank, and Ardbeg.  I got this via @Generously_Paul as part of our trading team.  Pears, pink Himalayan salt, lingering briny finish.  What’s not to like?  The finish especially reminds me of my mom’s samosas...a spicy salty taste, with fennel and coriander.  Thanks @Generously_Paul for the pour!"

4.0,"There's not much information out there concerning its aging or what types of barrel the distillery uses, but this is not just stronger Talisker 10.  It is quite different in flavor.  On the nose, the overwhelming trio of flavors are brine, herbal and ginger tea, and farmhouse mustiness.  My wife picked up on the maritime notes more and described it as ""fish scales.""  There's definitely something to that.  The palate is sweeter than the nose and picks up a grapefruit note, but the herbal, ginger, maritime, and peppery kick of Talisker continued barreling ahead at full steam.  The finish emphasizes that ginger tea aspect to it and has a tinge of cough syrup flavor that did not thrill me.  With a little water, more of the oak and wood tannins assert themselves.  This is an expensive bottle, pushing $100, and strikes me as similar to what a cask-strength Ballechin would taste like."

4.25,Camardicus nailed this in his review. I was thinking how I'd sum this one up and there were all the thoughts in my head :-). Can't believe this is 57% it's so drinkable. Definately my 2nd favourite Talisker and 4.25 or 4.5 rounding up for value or maybe higher I think. I'll have to compare against the 10 as I have a feeling there could be a tie here. Completely smokes the Kilchoman 10th Anniversary of similar % I had a few days ago (sadly not reviewed as I've given up on Distiller adding anything in a timely manner or at all these days)

The nose brings barbecued meat, brine, maritime sea shell notes, lemon zest and honey. The palate brings a nice heat up front on the mouth, and thankfully not down the throat. Similar notes lead to the palate, plus more zest, black pepper, smoke and apples. The finish is medium and a decent length as well. This one is very well rounded and a classic, and the theme should be so as well. ""In the Mood"" by Robert Plant will work. This is a solid 4.5!"

4.0,"A really good whisky, and one of the more complex ones I have ever come across, though all of the aromas do not always play nice. Whereas both the Talisker 10 and 18 are five piece bands that play on beat, the 57 North is more of a grandiose orchestra, at times majestic and at other times discordant. The nose initially exposes you to asian pear, brine, and a difficult to identify disinfectant you usually smell at the dentist's office (in a good way). The palate adds layers of ocean air, subtle raisins (almost like a sherry) and sweet caramel squares. The finish itself is enveloping and smooth, though a certain undertone of bitterness takes away from the overall pleasure. Still, it's great stuff."

Taste : Mainly peat and malt, with a touch of salt and oak. Particularly smooth for 57% ABV. Adding a touch of water brings out the salt and the malt.

Finish : Long and smooth. Smoke is the main element. Adding a bit of water makes it malty and spicy a bit also."

3.5,"My first exposure to Talisker was years ago at a tasting where my experience with scotch was the small world of Johnnie Walker and Glenlivet.  Talisker 10 just blew me away.  Talisker 18 is one of my all time favorites.  This Talisker through TRE was provided by the extremely knowledgeable @Generously_Paul through our SDT group which has now been long completed except by me.  Now enough my background, onto the whisky. 

Its golden colored. A dense nose that contains notes of earthy mineral, rubber and a maritime brine. Grilled apricots, honey and a pinch of pepper.  There is an rubbing alcohol quality that hovers with some malty sweetness.

The initial sips arrive harsh and abrasive like sandpaper.  The scratchy sensation dissipates and turns to pepper and sugary sweetness and fruitiness of apricots and pineapples.  There are notes of lemon zest and charcoal that are more exposed towards the finish.  

Water tempers the spice which allows the sweetness to push forward.  Scotch fog (not a mist) is quite apparent.

What remains on the palate for a medium length of time is a drying oak, black pepper, charcoal and some bitterness. 

This is a spicy one.  The Talisker pepper notes and readily available, however, it lacks a comparative depthness to the classic 10 and to the obvious 18.  For me, this is closer to the Storm the the aforementioned but lacks the smokiness.  A spot of water is all that is needed, if you wish. Anything more weakens the dram. All in all, still enjoyable and I thank @Generously_Paul for this sample as my (lack of) travels prevent me from coming across this one. [87/100][Tasted: 2/8/19]"

4.0,"Talisker has been a favorite of mine ever since I tasted their 10 year old, so I figured it's about time to give their other expressions a shot. The 57°N is much heavier on the peat, and that's a good thing. Once your nose gets past that wall of peat, there is a coastal breeze with salty air and brine that greets you, and also somebody left a fresh apple pie on the windowsill to cool somewhere, because that apple smell is mixed into the briny air. Taste is not surprising at first, starting with peaty malt, a dash of salt, but then there are some smoky dark fruits. just below the peat layer, and some of the sweet apples on top. The 57ABV gives it a bit of a spicy burn that feels right at home in the peaty mix. The aftertaste is long, very long, and consists of spicy, herbal and salty smoke. This is almost twice the price of the 10 year, and I'm not really sure if that's too pricy or not, but hell, without the comparison, 75 bucks are allright for this amazing juice. Not a go to whisky, but something for a dreamy journy along the shores of the Isle of Skye."

4.25,"This is the review I did on Master of Malt website one year ago as soon as I opened my bottle and drank the first dram:

""Just WOW!!
Just opened a bottle of this nectar of Gods and WOW!! This is good, really good! 
Some citrus and smoke on the nose and the palate is very thick, some spice, some caramel sweetness and a little brine. Incredible mellow for 57%
Add some water and the spiceness really kick in! Crazy stuff.""

Strangely I remember that when I tasted it the first time at the Distillery I wasn't so ""wowed"" as I was when drinking from my new bottle at home.

So I just poured a dram to write the review and it reminded me of my first impressions. A very good whisky but the WOW factor is gone.

Be sure not to keep this bottle open for a long time... Share it with some friends! ;-)

(Decided it would be fair to drop 1 star for this review - Now a 4 stars)"

3.0,"Flashback to the hotel room whisky share prior to Whiskyfest DC, my buddy @Generously_Paul brought ample pours of this newer NAS from Talisker:  57 degrees North.  This is essentially a cask strength version of their other non-age statement offerings.  The age of the juice is estimated to be 6-8 years old and the name not only indicates the ABV but also the latitudinal location of the distillery itself.  Kinda cool.

The color is a rich gold and there’s a few thick legs that’ll snake down the tasting glass when you give it a solid spin.  The nose is typical Talisker:  smoke, peat, pepper and BBQ.  The saltiness provided a stiff backbone and I got what seemed like a stiff hit of mint each time I put it to my nose.  I think this minty freshness could be attributed more to the extra ABV than any other factor.

The palate starts you off with a strong punch from the alcohol, but then the pepper and thick Talisker smoke take hold before releasing some thin citrus notes and an odd syrupy sweetness.  The harsh aspect of the young sauce also wrecks the overall mouthfeel, as well.

The finish is incredibly harsh and hot.  I don’t like adding water to anything I drink, especially when I only have a single pour to rate with.  If I have the entire bottle to play with I may do some experimental pours and blending, but I mostly like to drink them the way the distillery intended.  More smoky aspects remain behind on the finish, which was delightfully medium-long.  There were some roasted nut flavors left behind long after you finish the dram.

This one was tougher to enjoy than I truly expected.  I love Talisker almost as much as I love Laphroaig, but this one was a bit of a failure.  It’s too harsh and gets manhandled by the pepper notes.  Maybe 57% is too much for their juice to handle, but they wanted a semi-cask strength offering to compete with everyone else, but this one isn’t a high quality example IMHO.  3-3.25 stars because it’s still nice and smoky, but ultimately I don’t think I’d buy a bottle of this one.  Cheers."
4.0,"The final bonus sample from this current round of the SDT is from everyone’s favorite Island distillery, Talisker. 57° North is a travel retail exclusive. Not only does the 57 refer to the strength of the whisky, but also the distillery’s global coordinates (which happens to be Lat 57° 17’.9N, Long 06° 21’.5 W). Bottled at 57% ABV and is most likely natural color of honey gold and I can confirm that it is non chill filtered. 

The nose is pepper and peat smoke, although the latter is somewhat restrained. Slightly medical. Malty/cereal, herbal and floral. BBQ meats, mostly chicken and maybe some hamburger, both of which are over cooked and dried out. Earthy and vegetal (more peat). Honey, lemon, dried apricots and grilled oranges. Balanced oak, faint mint, fennel or maybe licorice. Olive brine/salty, lemon custard and vanilla sweetness. With water there is more honey and grilled fruits, hay and chalkiness. It becomes chalky pretty quick. 

The palate is sweet up front but the signature Talisker pepper quickly takes control and overpowers any sweetness that was there. Not much peat or smoke at first, but it does build a bit. Ashes and barrel char, salty. Water brings out honey and citrus in the form of lemons and pineapple. 

A medium-full bodied mouthfeel that is semi-dry and mouth coating. 
The finish is medium length, dry, slightly nutty with plenty of pepper, oak and a puff of smoke. 

The opposite of the 18 year old. Instead of elegant and refined, it’s a battering ram of pepper and spice. This is definitely a young whisky. Based on the high ABV and lack of real depth this is more than apparent. It’s main attribute is its brute force and ability to assault your senses (in a good way). Not much water needed, if any, to enjoy this one. Still, I would take the iconic 10 year old over this one any day of the week. I’d take the Storm/Dark Storm too. At $95 it’s not a great bargain either, considering the Dark Storm is about $30 less and they are both TREs (no tax since I got them at duty free) and both are 1L bottles. Yes the 57 gives you an extra 11.2% ABV, but in my opinion the trade off isn’t worth the money. Having said all that, this is still a solid 4 star single malt. 
Cheers"
4.25,"A lot of NAS duty free specials are rubbish, frankly, a reflection of global demand for Scotch outpacing the time required by maturing in barrels. This one is very fine (and extremely strong). 57%, but nicely balanced with the help of a few drops of water: a pleasant, gentle whiff of smoke to start, golden syrup on the first taste, with a long, salty, peaty finish. The label says ‘made by the sea’, which is precisely right. Unless you demand a peat monster like Lagavulin or Laphroaig, this is a delightful dram. Give it a try."

3.75,"Info: la fameuse version non dilué de Talisker. Une distillerie que j'affectionne particulièrement. C'est une version NAS. Je n'ai pu trouvé d'information sur l'âge mais cette bouteille me semble évidemment jeune. Le nom provient de la ligne de latitude de l'emplacement de la distillerie. 

Nez: fleur de sel, agrume et fumé de feu de camp humide

Bouche: Poivre et sel, beurre, fumé, poivre, poivre, poivre. 

Finish: longue sur le poivre. Chêne sec brulé.

Overall: J'aime beaucoup mon Lagavulin 12 et mon Glenlivet Nadurra first fill. Je croyais acheter une bouteille de la trempe d'un Lagavulin mais en fait l'intensité aromatique se rapproche plus de celle de mon Glenlivet. C'est bon. Très bon. Mais, pas à ce prix là. Il y a trop de meilleur scotch (à mon goût, bien entendu) sur cette tranche de prix que je considèrerais avant cette bouteille (dont le Lagavulin 12). Bref, je suis content de l'avoir acheté mais, je m'attendais à un ""wow"" alors que j'ai trouvé un ""mmh"". Peut-être est-ce trop un % trop élevé pour maintenir l'équilibre qui régnait dans leur version standard? Je ne sais trop. 87 moins 10  à cause de son prix = 77%"
4.0,"Nose - (w/o water) Sweet, salty, light fruity smoke, light hint of sweet/salty pulled pork, peppery brine (w/ water) Less peppery but otherwise the same

Taste - (w/o water) White pepper heat/tingle, sweet salty clean fruity smoke, smoked brined pears/apples, hint of golden raisins (w/ water) Burn is all but gone, less smoke, more saline, more apple/pear/white grape sweet

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering light white pepper tingle, fruity salty smoke, smoked pear sweet (w/ water) Still has a lingering spicy tingle, fruity saline, very light clean smoke re-appears

Score - 83/100

Final Thoughts - Nice balance of fruity and light smoke throughout. Nothing off-putting but at the same time nothing that really strikes me as amazing. A very pleasant peated dram that balances the smoke with salt & a light fruit.

Would I drink it if offered? - Maybe

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

1.5,"Bottled 2015.

I bought my 1L bottle of this on sale at a Duty Free for around 60 USD back in 2016.  I don’t think I’ve ever bought anything on sale at a Duty Free that I actually enjoyed.  On cold, windy, rainy evenings, when neither my dog nor I enjoy a mandatory walk; when she does her business, and we hurry back home; she will always get comfort rewarming next to the fireplace.  Her fireplace.  Every now and again, this bottle of Talisker, young and strong at 57%, tricks me into believing that it can provide the same comfort that her fireplace provides her.

This is a soulless, elemental experience from a time before the Earth could harbor life.  There’s dirt, mineral ore, and deep fried salt.  No fucking fish; or meat; or plant – just frying salt here.  That’s the nose.  On the palate, there’s a brief remembrance of Talisker 10, except amplified.  Lots of pepper, chili, caramel, citrus, and red fruits.  But the pleasantness is fleeting, and replaced by this mix of seawater and swimming pool water.  The finish claws at the back of the throat with jagged crystals of caramel and minerals.

A big helping of water smooths things out somewhat, but only by turning down the volume; it does not give this dram much needed life.  This is nothing compared to Talisker 10; but slightly better than Talisker Storm.  The alcohol warms me up a little, but everything else leaves me still chilly.  Time to snuggle up to my dog, and her fireplace, with a second pour of Ardbeg Kelpie.

Score: 0 (forgettable)
How much does a bottle cost: Not available where I live.  Check travel retail and online stores.  $77 on TWE.
How much do I think a bottle is worth: $35"
5.0,"My second cask strenght ever comes from my favorite brand, AND WHAT AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE IT WAS. Talisker 57° North is bottled at 57%abv and it is a bomb. Best with a couple drops of water. 

Bottled at 57%abv, with a deep copper color.

On the nose is classic talisker and the high abv doesn't hurt your capability to percieve the aromas. Pepper, Raw meat, english sauce, salt and oregano.

On the palate is POWERFUL but spectacular: Red fruits for a second, then a Spice bomb, lots of smoke. Hints of orange and almonds here and there. 

Finish is strong, long, smoky and spicy.

Adding just 2 drops of water will reveal Earthy note on the nose and the same aroma but enhanced.

On the palate it will improve a lot: Lemon, tangerine and orange syrup sweetness amazing. Spicyness all over. Red fruit pulp and toffee.

Finish still very smoky and spicy too strong. One dram and i Asked if the air conditioner was turned off. POWERFUL.

Overall i give this dram a 97 over 100. Great whisky."
4.5,"I’m tasting this back to back with the popular 10yo trying to understand the big difference in the rating, and I can’t work it out. The nose is far less antiseptic, and the flavour better balanced-for my palate-between sweet and peaty notes. Not that it goes easy on the iodine and bacon, mind, but the delightful caramel up front leads you into that dark tarn  in far friendlier way. Perhaps it lacks some of the breezy saltiness of the 10yo, but makes up for it with a pleasing ethanol punch. Overall, a more approachable and satisfying malt, I’d say."

4.25,"Golden yellow (thanks coloring!), rather thick in the glass.
The nose is immediately invaded by the peat, beautifully fleshy, with an intense and almost chewable smoke. Leather, burnt wood and ocean waves, very salty and spicy. Pepper, like any self-respecting Talisker. To insist patiently, there is also a hint of vanilla, all without ever being disturbed by alcohol. 
In the mouth the 57 degrees are felt with a nice initial pinch, the peat becomes sweeter and less fleshy, but always smoked, and leaves room for the ocean bomb, almost to hear the waves crashing on the rocks (what the Storm, in short, didn't know how to do). And when you dry the splashes of the sea from your face, orange, cinnamon, vanilla and much, much pepper with nutmeg arrive. The feeling is that of a bonfire on the rocks, without however the effort of preserving the fire from the fury of the water: the aromas chase and mix, with the push of alcohol and spices that holds everything together.
The finish is long, with dull embers, salty and spicy, with caramelized orange on the fire (when you make a bonfire, don't you caramel some orange?)"
