null,Hand painted bottle. Blended.
3.0,I could feel the difference between the hibiki 21 and Thia special edition. Regardless it has very similar Flavours but the slight peatiness does come off a bit rough (I dislike peat). For the price it's probably a better pick than the 21 but not sure.

3.0,A tad bit too sweet. Nice smooth smell of vanilla. A bit of orange on the pallate. Long finish.
