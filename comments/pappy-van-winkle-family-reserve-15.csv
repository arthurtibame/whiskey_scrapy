5.0,"Opened in 2015 tasted in January 2020

Color: deep ale, copper

Nose: Extremely unique and complex. Notes include: light caramel, honey, oak, toffee, butterscotch. Best nose on any whiskey I have tried. Nothing else like it. The palate is great as well, but the nose is what really shines for me.

Palate: deep rich oak with some cherry. Obviously quite smooth due to the age, but there is slightly more burn than I expected due to the proof. There's a unique flavor of honey that I rarely taste with bourbon. Beautiful medium finish.

Overall, this is one of the top three whiskeys I have tried (if not the best). I understand many people are annoyed by Pappy due to the hype, but in my opinion Pappy deserves it. However, I find it ridiculous people pay close to $1000 for this bottle secondary. This bottle is certainly worth a couple hundred dollars, but I simply don't think it is worth it to pay thousands of dollars for it (unless $1000 isn't a lot of money to you). This is definitely worth trying at a bar at least once in your life if you love bourbon. Don't stress out if you can never find a bottle of Pappy.  There are several bourbons that are widely available and a fraction of the price that aren't comparatively that much worse. I love everything about Pappy 15, but I also love other bourbons that are nearly as enjoyable that you can actually find."

4.75,This is the best Pappy I have had. The extra proof creates a long finish. Better than the 23 in my opinion. This is Weller 12 all grown up.

However my most favorite by far is Micdrop!"
4.5,Pappy holds up to its name. Exceptional bourbon but I would not spend that kind of money. 1500$ is way too much

4.75,"A generous taste courtesy of Pie Chef Guy.

I had always thought you'd have to do something along the lines of battling a dragon in order to get a bottle of this. Somehow Pie Chef Guy got one. That in and of itself is impressive, but I digress. 

This is the penultimate granddaddy of bourbons (metaphorically speaking).

The nose is full of salted caramel, sweet chocolate and peanut brittle. A bit like walking into an old family owned candy shop.

The taste is even better. It tastes just like fresh baked sugar cookies from grandma, apple pie crust, and light vanilla with just a sprinkle of unicorn blood.

The finish lasts with wonderful flavors of vanilla, honey and warm apple cider.

Simply put, this is easily one of the best bourbons I have had the pleasure to drink, or be in the same room with."

4.25,"I had an unexpectedly good financial year last year so I decided to splurge on my first bottle of Pappy 15. It was now or never...

I tried it a few years ago at a bar in Louisville when I was a whiskey novice and was truly floored - it was the smoothest, lightest, most elegant bourbon I’d ever had and started me down the path of true whiskey appreciation.

I’ll admit I was a bit nervous opening this bottle. I’ve had hundreds of bourbons since that first taste so my palate has become much more jaded.

First impression...a very subtle oakiness and a bit of smoke, hints of plum and raisin, and practically zero bite for 107 proof. 

Having leaned heavily towards barrel proofers lately, a light, sweet wheater didn’t make much of an impact but trying it again the next day revealed new levels of depth and completely that reminded me exactly why this bottle has become such a status symbol. It is approachable for newcomers to the whiskey world with enough sophistication for those who have been around the block.

So if drinking big, bold barrel proofers like GTS is like attending a loud rock concert then drinking Pappy 15 is like listening to a jazz trio. We are lucky to be living in an age with so many spectacular whiskey options for whatever suits your mood."
5.0,"I can now say, that i am a true Whisky Critic since i have finally tasted the unicorn of Whiskies, the famous PAPPY VAN WINKLE. This 15yo expression took me quite a while to find, i was on Miami on vacations, (remember i am from Ecuador) and i went first to a place called Casa de Montecristo that allegedly had Pappy but when i went there, they had ran out of it. Then I search a little on the internet and found that they had pappy on a beautiful place called Apothecary 330, in fort lauderdale, i traveled an hour to get there. 

When i saw the ""pappys"" i flipped. They were finally reachable... except for the price. The 20yo was $70 the 1oz (3cl). Way too much.

So i took the 12yo lot b, and this one the 15yo. ($35 and $50 each)

This is my review for the 15yo. Lets set things straight (i might hurt someone's feelings here): this is by far the best bourbon i have ever had. It is BEAUTIFULLY CRAFTED, but... it is still a bourbon. That means (for me) that it will always be inferior to some scotches, even if it is the best bourbon ever.

Well, lets start. This is an amazing dram. SO COMPLEX. no alcohol note at all.  Deep Copper color, 53.5%abv.

Most Bourbons have at least 51% corn whiskey, rye and barley. This have wheat instead of rye, making it smoother. 

Prepare for a lot of notes. Lots of layers. 
Nose: starts with your typical bourbon notes, banana (but very refined), rust (like an old penny coin), caramel from creme caramel (lovely) (best thick caramel note ever), mashed old bananas (when they become darker) metallic, vanilla. Superb.

On the palate is the glory. The ""coin metalic rust"" can be tasted, sour and salty at the beggining; lemon. Then bombs explode one after another (lots of layers, beautiful sensation, not at the same time): first a pepper bomb, then a vanilla short bomb, then a herbal explosion, everything explodes, it is not a taste, it is explosion of flavor. Oak and brown cake is there too. Marvelous.

The aftertaste has every spice there is. Clove, allspice, pepper, ginger. Finish medium, mouth goes to sleep with every sip. 

What can i say, it is a work of art. Worth every penny... or maybe not. $350 would be the most i would pay for it, it is not possible to get it for that price. 

Overall, 100 over 100, long live to the king of bourbons, Pappy Van Winkle. Cheers!"
