4.25,Sampling at Amsterdam airport duty free.  Much better than 21 but too pricey for flavor

5.0,"I had read before that this one was a great dram, but i didn't expect it to be so incredible. This one was an enormous experience for me, and it was because of its orange notes, they were simply amazing, i will get to that later. 

Bottled at 40%abv, burnished gold color.

On the nose, it was fantastic. First a sherry elegant note, with some milk chocolate aroma. Then, out of nowhere: KABOOM! Did someone prepared a fresh orange juice just now?? 

I had never experience such a clean orange note. It was exactly the aroma of cutting a fresh orange in half and putting it on the Blender and then pouring the most fresh orange juice ever on your glass. AMAZING. (Spoiler alert for a future review: i also had the ballantine's 21 and it has the same orange note) 

On the palate it was also incredible: milk chocolate, oranges, amontillado sherry sweetness, clove and some herbal/lavender notes.

Aftertaste was long and rewarding, a strong refined oaky note, with some brown sugar; and then some spices: black pepper and Ginger that makes your whole mouth numb.

Overall this one was such a nice dram, a little complex but more than that, it was truly enjoyable. My score for it is 100 over 100 and i definitively recommend it."

5.0,Maybe the one of the best whiskey that I wish I can afford on the regular basis.  I lived it because no specific elements overtakes the other.  This is one of the best perfect Harmony of flavors.
