Very light in colour, kinda like a white wine...
I didn't find the nose that powerful in peat... It is here yes, but not strongly. 
On the palate it is light-bodied, Briny, with a slight saltiness. I found the peat to be rather gentle. 
I didn't find this special. In terms of peat I would still stick to other drams"

4.0,"Ah the big peat. One of the first peaty scotch I tasted. When you open the bottle, it smells like a fire place the just extinguish and release a sweet smoky odor. This blend is an excellent scotch that when to try a smoky scotch since it's very soft in mouth and the smoke keep on going for miles. It doesn't contain the nice body of a Lagavulin, neither the complexity of a highland park but if you feel for a nice smoky scotch, the one is a nice stop on the road."

3.0,Tastes like this is atleast 50% LAPHROAIG 12. And i HIGHLY doubt the amount of port ellen in each cask is less than a few drops.  (the distillery has been closed since the 80s the for those who didnt know).  About as honest as saying theres Lagavulin in white horse.  Aside from that.  If you ever wondered what all the Islay malts tasted like mixed in a drum this would be it.  None the less if you do see this for less than 50 American that would make it worth your purchase to give it a try.

2.0,"I like peated whiskies. But this one is totally unbalanced and gives you actually only peat, mud and smoke. Too much. Sorry."
3.25,"This Blended Malt is a combination of four Islay whiskies, although I doubt that it contains more than a few drops of Port Ellen. Hence, the presentation of Big Peat is quite misleading. Being non-chill filtered and bottled at 46% ABV, the malt comes without an age statement. Typical Islay peat smoke, coal tar and TCP dominate the nose, followed by underlying Caol Ila sweetness. It tastes young and bland, as the cask influence is lacking almost entirely. The finish is peaty sweet, rather dry and long. A decent whisky that's way too expensive for what it offers.

2.0,"[Second Meeting:]
  I finally got to sit down and sample this dram with no real time constraints, unlike the last time I sampled.  This is a story of two different drams: a brief encounter that was great but had blurred recollection with awe and the second where I got to really know the dram and was realized it was not what I expected. The dram opens on the nose with more earthy qualities like tequila with a touch of Caol Ila smoky sweetness (this this what mezcal smells like?).  The palate reveals the peatiness, smoke, and then demerara sugar, exactly in that order and not much more.  Finally, you are left with a mouthful of ash, wood, black pepper and slightly bitter and oddly, again, tequila-like (that of green, earthy freshness).
  
  Surprisingly clear in color like Ardbeg, but without the peaty inviting peatiness (Ardbeg, Caol Ila).  However, I was rather disappointed in my second encounter and found it not much more than a blend of malts than a harmony of malts.  The second “date” was awkward realization that it was probably a mistake and we’ll bid adieu. [83/100][Tasted: 11/7/16]
  
  [First Meeting:]
  This was the last thing I tasted.  Big Peat is highly accurate. Very strong peat nose.  Bacon lovers malt.  This is a very good, smokey, peaty blend.  Look forward to finding a bottle and further exploring this spirit. [Whisky on the Hudson 9/18/14]"

3.0,"The Bottle:  Kitschy, but not nearly as good as some of DL's others. Timorous Beastie, for example. Now that's a bottle!

In the Glass:  Pale straw. 

I'm the Nose:  Smoke & brine with a touch of tar. Alcohol. Youth.

Taste:  So, this is a ""baby"" Islay and it makes no excuses for it: smokey, sooty, sweet and salty. 
This reads as predominantly a young Ardbeg.  I know there are some others in the vat, but to my palate, Ardbeg is playing lead fiddle. Not a lot going on in the development, but the arrival and the finish are quite pronounced. 
Smoke up front, turning to a prolonged ""coal soot"" sweetness. 
For the money, I prefer some of the standard single malt bottlings from Islay; but I do not regret my purchase. There are a lot of good things going on here, despite the perceived youth.  Worth a look!"

2.0,"I'm no expert, but I love my peated whisky. My favourites so far are any of the laphroaig bottles, lagavulin 16yo & ardberg 10yo. 

This bottle of Big Peat was relatively cheap, and I was hopeful I'd found something great but at a more thrifty price. Unfortunately I can't say I'm a fan at all. There is definitely peat there, but it has a very harsh taste, almost like a cheap tequila but with a little peat. Maybe a good drop after you're no longer able to appreciate the nicer stuff ;)"

3.0,"Nose - Floral ashy smoke, sweet vanilla frosting, sea spray, sweet fresh hay.

Taste - Sweet ashy smoke, light creamy/waxy mouthfeel, hint of sea salt, light vanilla simple, tiny hint of white pepper tingle.

Finish - Lingering sweet ash, light ashy bitterness, sweet vanilla simple.

Score - 80/100

Final Thoughts - Although I'm not normally a huge fan of peat, I could tolerate this one. It wasn't too much like drinking bandaids/tar like I get from Laphroaig. This had a nice simple ashy smoke to it that was tolerable and a general overall sweetness that came from the malt & had hints of vanilla from what I'm guessing is primarily ex-Bourbon barrels. Nice hint of sea salt throughout and this pleasant waxy mouthfeel. Not exactly my favorite, but I can see where people could enjoy this.

Would I drink it if offered? - No

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

4.0,"Big Peat is a blended malt, sometimes called vatted malt, from Douglas Laing & co. The bottle features a bearded Scotsman (presumably named ""Pete"") wearing a cozy-looking sweater. It is unchil-filtered (yay!) and I don't think there's any mention of E150a, but this is so lightly coloured, almost clear, so I'd venture to guess it's bottled at natural colour. Which single malts are in this blend? According to the company's website:

“With Caol Ila spirit bringing sweetness, Bowmore the perfect balance, Ardbeg the medicinal, earthy quality and Port Ellen, a degree of elegance, Big Peat represents all that is Islay in a bottle. Fred Laing tells us that of course, there are a couple of Blender's Secrets in Big Peat too – but even after a few drams, he won’t share that info – and so it remains our peaty little secret!”

•Tasting notes•

• Nose (undiluted): smoke, peat, with citrus fruits and sweet barley grain behind it. Graham crackers perhaps. Smells like a toned-down Ardbeg. With time in the glass, a faint bacon aroma develops. I like this.
• Palate (undiluted): slightly oily texture yet still somewhat light-bodied. It's a bit briny, however there are lots of deep, dark flavours here; it's ashy on arrival, develops some pepperiness, and a touch of tobacco.
• Finish: somewhat drying, black pepper, tarry, slightly antiseptic, with some very dark chocolate ( > 85%) and coffee flavours lingering.

I did not, at any point, add water to this whisky. It did not need it and I didn't want to add any. My only criticism, and it is an admittedly minor one, is that it didn't have an overly wide spectrum of flavours. Most of the flavours are deep, dark, smoky and ashy. There seemed to be a bit of ""high end"" lightness lacking, especially on the palate and finish. Now this isn't a dealbreaker for me, as it tends to be the type of flavour profile I gravitate toward anyway, but I feel people should be aware of it. Big Peat's ""flavour colour"" or ""pitch of flavour"" is closer to Laphroaig Quarter Cask than it is to Lagavulin 8 Year Old, if that comparison makes sense. There's a stark contrast between the colour of this whisky and its flavour. Recommended.

5.0,"Final stop on my reviews on Douglas Laing core expressions; this is the time for BIG PEAT, surprisingly not that peaty, an Islay Blended Malt. Spoiler: it was great.

Bottled at 46%abv, white wine color (as ardbeg).

Before even reading the official story of the bottle i could identify ardbeg and bowmore on this one. It seems the third malt was port ellen, a silent yet famous distillery (closed since 1983).

On the nose is absolutely beautiful, only surpassed by the incredible palate. 
Cheap Wine (the ones you get on a plane for free), Dry cake as in all douglas Laing. Black Pepper; Perfumed peatyness ultra pleasant, but dim, as in Bowmore. Grassy notes. Brownie burnt crest. Oregano. You can easily get the ardbeg-bowmore idea from this description.

On the palate is divine. Sweet as honey/toffee with Pepper at the same time.
Absolutely gorgeous toffee-ashy-smoky finish, Instant masterpiece. Aftertaste long, mint toffee, pepper. Wonderful. Balance is great here. 

Overall i give this beauty a solid 98 over 100 and for the price you should run and buy it. Slainte Mhath!
