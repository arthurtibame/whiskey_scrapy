3.5,Maybe it was cos it was the 6th dram of the night but it's colour seemed to suggest a stronger flavour than it delivered. The nose was weird it smelled of cheese and I thought maybe they didn't wash the glass properly but then I saw other reviews that said baby puke or similar so I wasn't imagining that one. I didn't find it offensive just odd. Once you got past that you got the sweet red wine and orange notes coming through subtly.
