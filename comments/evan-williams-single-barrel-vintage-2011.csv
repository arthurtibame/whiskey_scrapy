3.5,Perfect gateway bourbon for friends who think drinking neat isn't their thing.
3.0,"Recommendation: Easy to drink, great for a beginner.  Just...okay.

Smell: So sweet it’s almost flat, but I loved the smell

Taste: smooth finish, a lot of caramel. Almost a bit dry but light tasting. 

Price: $28 I think it’s overpriced by a few dollars"
4.0,nice oak ...Sweet and salty ... earthy and floral

4.25,"Nose: candied pecans, butter, apple juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, oak, black pepper, some rye, a little heat

Taste: burnt brown sugar, honey, heat, oak, finish starts with black peppery, then leads to a sour rye/maple note."
4.0,"**Duplicate entry from the non-vintage listing.**  Bottle pour, neat, into Glencairn at home. Barreled on 1-5-11, barrel 3, bottled on 11-13-18. Nose is smooth caramel and butterscotch, some overripe apples. Beautiful. Taste brings some oak and spice to the mix, but the caramel stays underneath as a great base. Really nice, with a very pleasant lingering sweetness accented with just a hint of heat. Quite good. 6/8/19"

4.0,"Comapred an old 2010 bottle to the 2011.

Nose: Mellow. Corn, some spice, toffee

Taste: Sweetness, a little sour touch, rye spices come and go. Finish leaves lasting oak, some apple, and a little heat - yum!

While my 2010 bottle might be a bit oxidized, i think the 2011 is ultimately sweeter, spicier, and better. The 2010 was smooth from when I first pened it, but the 2011 has some wonderful spice notes."

4.25,"Loving this one. Barreled 8/25/11, barrel #1302, bottled 10/1/19. Def going to grab another while still on sale for under $30!"
4.0,"This bottle is barreled 2/3/11 bottled 8/19/19 barrel # 1108.........Better than the 2008 vintage I had before. Poured neat nose has plenty of caramel and butterscotch with oak and resin and a touch of stewed fruit. Palate is buttery smooth with  rich caramel, heavy oak, anise and peppery spice. Excellent flavor delivery and has some depth. Finish is standard dry barrel oak but the sweet buttery notes linger setting this apart. Not super complex but great value here at high 20$-low30$ for a single barrel age statement bourbon. Im gonna grab another of this years edition........90/100.....very impressed, best EW ive had to date despite lower proof. Will become a mainstay for me"
2.0,"Nose - oily, floral. 
Palate - basic. Oily. Floral."
3.75,"For a value single barrel, Evan Williams single barrel (2011) is a very pleasant sipper! My experience with single barrels (which I admit is fairly limited) can be hit or miss. This year must have been a decent one.  This sipper has a light mouthfeel with distinct oakiness and a sweet/candied peppery finish. If you haven’t tried it before, I recommend grabbing a bottle. Again for a single barrel that is sub $30 it is a good value!"
