4.5,"Caramel, toffee, vanilla."
3.25,"Sweet fruity smell, woody taste, light finish"
3.5,"Reviewed from a 2 oz pour.

On the nose, it has some honeyed scents with some berries. Maybe cherry. On the taste you get some strong vanilla, caramelized sugar, with some tartness on back of the tongue.  There’s a steady burn throughout. It has a short finish with some oak. 

I compared it to another wheated bourbon I had on hand: Weller Special Reserve. Similar price points (at retail). I liked Weller a bit more due to its distinct apple flavor and long finish.

Conclusion: Solid budget bourbon. Give it a chance if you’re looking for a cheap whiskey. At this price point (~$20), I’d probably buy something else. However, I wouldn’t turn it down if offered. Cheers!"
3.5,Spicy notes. The more I have of this the more I like it.
3.5,On the nose it smells balanced and rich with typical bourbon notes. I kind of get a nutty note like hazelnut also. Oily and stays on the tongue.

1.0,"So store pick, was told 8 years old but based on bottle date can't be over 7. 

Nose - distinct wheat finish, vanilla, and a hell of a lot of nutty notes. I'm a bit confused at how nutty this is, very much a heaven hill or jim beam like note. 

Taste - very light bourbon but yet i still get a bit of alcohol bite and heat. Honestly, I'm struggling to get past alcohol, nutty notes, and then on the finish vanilla and a hair of oak. There's nothing distinct here. 

Full disclosure I bought this thinking it might mix well with coke or rootbeer. It doesn't, it actually disapears to the point I can't tell there's bourbon in the glass. A great thing for a college party, but not really what I want when I'd like to have a nice summer sipper where I still can enjoy some bourbon character. 

1 star, nothing wrong with it. It's a bit spirit forward for the age and proof but i tend to find some cheaper bourbons when watered down almost seem more alcohol forward and not less. 

Not a bourbon I'd recommend to really anyone. I don't get enough wheater character to justify this as a replacement for other wheats and if you want something nutty maybe try a beam black, imo that's better juice."

3.75,"Sweet with prominent wheat notes, strong citrus on the finish. Would be great for an Old Fashioned."
4.25,A readily available wheated bourbon for under 30$? Yes please! Found the nose on this one to be pretty typical. Smells like a sweeter bourbon maybe some sugar sweet notes. Taste is sweet and ends in a slight oak with very little spice and heat. Having trouble pin pointing all the different flavor notes in this one both neat and OTR but it is quite good and complex for it to be so cheap. This will be a go to bourbon in my collection for sure. This is very good.

2.75,The nose is somewhat lacking. Typical bourbon notes. Nothing special. On the palette I get a bit of harshness at first. However as I allow it to open up I find it more interesting.
2.75,"Larceny’s nose and palate are not offensive, but nothing to write home about.  Caramel and bananas come to mind.  The palate is nutty, however somewhat bitter.  There is some nice spice on the finish, however I find it to be a bit short, possibly a reflection of the lower proof.  If you are a fan of wheaters, this may be a good bourbon to jump on.  At $23, there are very few other options that are as nice as this for the price point."

3.5,"A nice story. That is what this dram has. This is a 4.0 because of my scoring system but it surely feels like a 3.5.

Well, ""Larceny"" is an english term for a non violent steal, and has a lock and a key on the bottle, next to John E. Fitzgerald name. 

Apparently, Heaven Hill discovered that John E. Fitzgerald wasn't a distiller but really a bonded treasury agent, who had the keys to a distillery. The myth says that he entered at night to the distillery and drank from the best casks. 

But this great story is not all. This Larceny Bourbon is a ""wheated"" bourbon. That means that it has 51% at least of corn whiskey and the rest is wheat whiskey, not having any rye on it. 

Well, bottled at 46%abv, tawny color. 

On the nose, lots of aromas, but not quite spectacular. Typical bourbon aroma but more herbal. Banana very dim not as protagonist as in other bourbons. Brown sugar, Caramel, Herbal vanilla note; Spicy but not a traditional spice: a rare more herbal cinnamon. After 5 minutes it opens to vanilla ice cream and dry cake. 

On the palate, it doesn't deliver the promise you get on the nose. Bitter dry fruits: Its like prunes but bitter, I don't know how to explain it. Nice body but too bitter,  little spicy - ginger; There is some wood influence but is clearly too young. Tobbacco and bitter coffee beans. Finish has a wet raw rice note, very long.

Overall this is interesting, might make a great mixer due to its bitterness. I give it a 80 over 100, getting exactly to the 4.0 score, eventhough it feels like a 75 over 100."

3.5,"On the nose, crisp green apple and almost a sour grape note. 

On the pallet, slightly nutty and the apple note sweetens, with a little vanilla. 

The finish is wheaty with honey, and the vanilla strengthens. 

Overall, a great choice for the cost."

4.0,"This particular expression I tried was a Barrel Select from a local liquor store.  I was genuinely very surprised by this bourbon.  It was much friendlier than I was expecting it to be.  For the price, I was expecting it to be a little harsh and pretty thin in terms of flavor.  But, it actually overs a good amount.  It's sweet and silky with a water-like consistency and mouthfeel.  The flavor of sweet corn persists throughout.  This bourbon is among the sweetest I've had which might be a turn-off for some, but I love most kinds of bourbon and this one is very deserving.  For me, this would be a fantastic dumb reach bourbon because it isn't that expensive so you don't have to feel bad for drinking it frequently, and it isn't challenging to drink whatsoever.  Looking for a casual drinker for when you just want a bourbon to casually sip, this is one I highly recommend."

3.5,"Soft and light, with a slight peanut character. The wheat character definitely sweatens things up."
4.0,"This is a fun, sweet bourbon to have on hand. The nose is a honey sweetness with spicy vanilla, maraschino cherry, orange zest, and a wheat breadiness that especially shows up in blind tasting flights. If you find the wheat bread note you can instantly pick it out. On the taste, there is an apple note that plays well with the strong honey and round grain notes. The finish is where the oak char and a peanut-shell nuttiness comes through."

It’s an interesting and easy palate to sip but not overly complex or satisfying.  Good for beginners and can’t imagine mixing it into much...  kind of like the wheated equivalent of Basil Hayden."

3.25,"Larceny Small Batch Bourbon is a wheated, hand selected six-year-old Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey. The mashbill consists of corn, wheat, and malted barley however, we do not know the percentages. This 92 proof/46% ABV bourbon is incredibly approachable, especially for beginners to bourbon. Albeit it will not wow anyone, nor is it anything close to superb, this whiskey is very consistent and a solid bourbon for the very affordable price.

Color: Brown Gold

At looking at the glass there was slow steady legs sliding down the glass. Before even nosing, I could smell the delightfully sweet aromas from the wheated bourbon. After further exploration I found hints of cinnamon, buttery biscuits, syrup, peaches, and brown sugar on the nose. When I took a sip, hints of brown butter, biscuits, slight spice, vanilla, and toffee exploded on the palate, but in a good way. The finish is medium to long and rather dry, with hints tobacco, charred oak, and toffee."

3.25,"(Blind vs. Maker's Mark) 
As mentioned in my Maker's review, like many Maker's was a gateway bourbon for me.  As I've become more of a bourbon fan, I hear all the experts speak about Larceny and how much of a great Maker's substitute it is...  (boom - Blind!)
As I drank this, I was convinced it was Maker's. Convinced - I thought the other was more complex and this was formulated to be muted for the mass market. I was wrong.
Aroma was of straight corn grain and a touch dusty.  Light Oak.

Flavor - Honey, cinnamon and toasted bread. Then Corn Flakes and a touch of caramel.  Smooth front to back.  No finish to speak of. (Finish is my favorite) 
3 Drops of water really helped open this.  Straight to more Corn, more cereal and some light baking spice."

Nose - sugar, sweetness, cherries, light oak smell. 

Taste - as soon as this hits the tongue it’s sweet. I get sugar immediately. Cherries and vanilla come to my palate as well as it coats my tongue. The finish is more sweetness and a deep sugar with some oak and a very slight burn of spice. Dang this is a good treat tasting bourbon.

Overall and value - you cannot beat this bourbon if you like an easy drinker and something sweet. I personally love all aspects of this bourbon and it’s easily found under 30$. Adds a lot of value when it’s cheap and easy to find. Must buy for anyone who prefers a sweet bourbon"
