null,"Quite harsh neat but really opens up when a wee bit of water is added. Very smooth! Fruity, honey and vanilla tastes and a nice soft finish"

4.0,Definitely air it out and maybe a bit of water. You can taste the sea where this was aged.

2.0,Not my favourite from my favourite distillery. A poor 2 out of 5 stars compared to what I've tasted from Laddie.

4.0,"Nose - Dried apples, fresh pears, floral, hint of clean salty sea air, hint of grass, riesling soaked golden raisins.
Taste - Lightly oaky grape/apple juice, light apple/pear skin bitterness, peppercorn spice.
Finish - Lingering peppercorn spice, lightly bittersweet apple/pear juice made from the cores.
Score - 86/100
Final Thoughts - This is sadly a bit disappointing as the nose promised so much more than what it delivered on the palate. The nose was great, but it was a bit one/two dimensional on the palate. Tasty in its own right, but I guess a bit of a letdown from the nose. Is great neat, but I can see the slightly higher proof help it stand up to something like a blood and sand."
