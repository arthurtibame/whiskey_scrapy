5.0,"Who doesn't love samples? Last year, I calculated that I consumed an estimated $8.7 million dollars worth of free chicken parmesan samples at Costco. @buckyparks graciously sent me a sample of something I've been curious to get my hands on: Barrell Bourbon. This is batch #6, which is legendary upon Barrell enthusiasts and I see why!  First waft, whiff, and sip I immediately think of OBSQ Four Roses, but I realize this is a Tennessee sourced whiskey so thats not possible. It's so fruity and flowery, with a burst of Big Red gum at the end.  Had an embarrassing ugly cry when this one was over. I was giving my whiskey glass an unflattering, desperate licking after this sample was gone.  For this batch, I'm busting out the big boners. Great job Barrell! 4.8 out of 5 boners"
5.0,Best of the 3 Barrell Bourbon types I've tried. This is a real winner. A little pricey though.

5.0,"Similar to bookers, but not as strong on the front end. Not as good of a value  at 18 versus 11 at the oak."

5.0,"Nose seems simple at first, after a few seconds you sense a wave of walnuts. On the palate, lots of heat, even compared to the 007 which is of similar proof. Intense but not overbearing spice follows and sticks to the tongue. Walnuts, caramel, honey, potpourri. This is walnut liquer, but complex and delicious. Maybe my favorite bourbon. This is a must try, although I'm hoping everyone will forget about this so that I can grab what remaining bottles are left in the wild. 2/18/17.
I had Batch 011 last night, it was very good, so I wanted to try this again tonight to confirm that Batch 006 was still my favorite Barrell. Confirmed. Sweet walnuts on the nose, and I do get pears this time as well. If you're not careful, this will make your eyes tear up upon first sip. Charred oak, baking spices, honey roasted nuts, cocoa nibs, with a pleasant sting and deep burn throughout. Unfortunately, I haven't found a replacement for my one bottle, I'll be sad when I get to the bottom of this one. 5/22/17"

5.0,"One of the best new bourbon releases in 2017, alongside Four Roses Al Young. Barrell never released a better batch (bourbon) so far."

4.0,"In the glass, Batch 006 is a mahogany or bronze shade, quite dark and rich in appearance.  The nose is the best part of Batch 006.  Asian pear, plum, peach, exotic fruits all around.  Significant oak gave the nose a firm framework for those sweeter flavors.  Just a slight hint of singing alcohol, to be expected with such a powerful bourbon.  Unfortunately, that's followed by a bit of a letdown.  Batch 006 has a fruity entry, consistent with the nose, then some toffee, plums, brown sugar, heather, and ginger.  But the notes don't punch with power, if that makes any sense, a particularly odd realization given the proof.  Batch 006 had something of the ""hole in the palate"" sensation, which is a strange turn of phrase that I've seen in other reviews and have come to understand after trying a lot of different whiskies.  There comes a point in the flavor progression where you expect the experience to amp up (it's kind of a, ""Now for the guitar solo!"" moment).  Only a few bourbons rise to the challenge, and those are the true superstars.  I don't think this bourbon quite hits that high water mark.  On the plus side, it does finish for days and is quite complex.  I get rye spice, cherry candy, and lots of oak, with a ton of warmth as it travels down the throat.  However, the lasting final note from it is a grassy, slightly bitter flavor that I associate with younger cask-strength whiskies."
