3.5,"Nose is full of spices i.e. cinnamon, not picking up much else. Taste is slightly sweet with nice bits of caramel, pepper and lingering sweetness. Overall, pretty good but nothing special."
3.0,"Fruity, floral with aromas of prunes or raisins. Sweet on the tongue with late warmth and medium long finish. #flaviar"

2.25,"Not my favorite but not bad.  Floral and fruity.  Aftertaste has something I am not sure about.  I am on the fence.  Not worth $59 for a bottle,  but worth a  pour."
3.0,"Nose has spicy cinnamon And black pepper 

Taste light flavor, starts off sweet, ends with a fruity peach taste."

2.0,Too syrupy for me. Had a soapy/leathery finish that wasn't my style.
2.5,Rubbery. Sweet. Smoky. Not my favorite
3.75,Very smooth. Nice flavor. Tingly and warm. Not too much burn.
3.75,Touch of sweetness in the finish
3.25,Heavy caramel and cinnamon with something else that seems out of place but can't quite figure it out. Quick finish

4.0,Wow. A bit of a bite but wow. I have not looked yet but I assume this is rye heavy. Solid bourbon.

2.75,"Color is dark honey. Nose starts with a little youth from the corn. Beneath that lies vanilla and caramel. The youth covers a lot of the other possible smells. First sip is oak and caramel, with a hint of black pepper. Some fruits follow that, as well as some vanilla. Mouthfeel is moderately viscous. Finish however has that immature corn, though not as potent as the nose. The immaturity doesn't completely ruin it, but definitely detracts from an otherwise quite sippable Bourbon. Definitely would not pay asking price for this."
2.5,Caramel is overwhelming to me. Not a smooth sipping whiskey. Possibly better in a few years?
