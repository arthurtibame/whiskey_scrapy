4.0,"It's a hodgepodge of scents and flavors, kind of fun to figure out! Toasted marshmallows, fresh cut dandelions, and charred maple wood on the nose.  The palate picks up walnut, dried cherries, and frothy seafoam. Awfully unique in the vast world of bourbon whiskey!"

4.0,"The description in Distiller says sweet, but I found it to be earthy, almost smokey. Good."
5.0,"Several months ago, I tried a pour of batch #5 in an establishment in downtown Denver.  Yesterday, i did the local Laws distillery tour.  I have to say that i am very impressed with this bourbon in many ways.  The no compromise approach they use is something I have never seen in this industry.  Their process is perhaps 95% transparent.  They will tell you the mash bill and explain the process to the point of only keeping the wart boiling  temperatures and the actual distillation temperatures a secret. They cut no corners to craft the product they produce.  
    
    Here are my tasting notes:
    
    Nose: it has a nice alcoholic fuminess and a very pleasant smell.  I detect some pepper and leather and a tiny bit of spiciness from the rye.  As the glass is swirled, it is very noticeable  that the glycerine content is high in this spirit.  There is a very dark caramel color for it only being 3 years old. 
    
    Taste: Peach, apricot, butterscotch, vanilla, a tiny bit of chocolate.  Rolling into the mid palate and finish, I detect a good deal of distilled grape such as sherry flavors. Perhaps if i were to have a critique of the profile, i would say this ""sherry"" flavor is a little too predominant.  However, there are lots of bold but plesant flavors and an incredible amount  of complexity for a 3 year old bourbon.  
    
    Finish: this spirit has a nice burn but it is not excessive.  The finish lasts a very long time.  There is a very nice syrupy-ness without being too thick.
    
    Overall, I have to say that this is a VERY good spirit, especially keeping in mind that it is only 3 years old.  Its not perfectly rounded, but I believe this will come as they release older age statements in the coming years. I think it could use a little more oak and char to round out the  palate.   I predict in the future that this will be one of those bourbons that are impossible to find and will trade on the secondary market for exponentially more than MSRP.
    
    Unfortunately, since they are a new company, this product is not readily available  in many areas.  I will call it Colorado's best kept bourbon secret.  If you get to this state, search out a liquor store and pick up a bottle.  
    
    Since they have been on the market now for 4 years, they have started releasing expiramentals. at the distillery, they had two wheat whiskeys that can be found in some stores.  the ""a"" is 100% wheat and the ""b"" is a wheat with 5% malted barley. Both are very good spirits.  They allowed us to try a Cask Strength  single barrel bourbon.  I was so impressed with this one that I purchased a bottle to take home.  A few months ago, they released a ""bottled in bond"" variety.  Unfortunately, they were sold out and I was unable to try this one.  i will be looking for it the next time its released....."

4.0,"Not sure why this is rated so low. A solid bourbon that I always keep in my rotation. heavy caramel and tobacco notes with a bold and unapologetic finish. Like the guy that pulls his welding truck into the last liquor store parking space in front of your wannabe monster truck. Frankly, I give this a solid ""90""."

I like it, very interesting dram, unique like Balcones is but not as artificial or one noted. Impressive for a young dram. Wasn't impressed by its Secale Rye brother but this is a 4."

4.0,"Excellent stuff! Tried the bonded bourbon at the distillery and bought a bottle of the farmers select(47.5 abv) to take home. The wheat and barley together play really well against the corn and rye. Not exactly sure what or how they did it but this is interesting stuff, which garners a higher rating than that given by the reviewer."

This begins like a wheater, very soft, honey and caramel.  Mid brings some tobacco and pepper.  Finish.... is harsh, tastes like young oak.  Aging another 4-6 years would probably make an amazing whiskey. As it is bottled, it isn't."

2.0,"What better way to kill an hour at the Denver airport than to try a local Colorado craft distillery?  With craft Americans, I’ve learned they fall into three categories:
1) tried and tested must haves: the likes of Del Bac Dorado, McKenzie and High West.  
2) on the fence, depends on product and batch: High West, Westland, Balcones , Westward, New Southern Distillery, St George 
3) try at bar: countless to list 

This one falls in (3).  I’m glad I’ve tried a local CO product, but not worth the asking price of $80-100USD.  Nose is mild—almost like sourdough bread.  You get more action in the palette—rye being the foremost.  

Overall, interesting pour—try at a bar to experiment or experience."

4.75,"A really complex and tasty bourbon. It’s dramatically different than most bourbon profiles and it’s a really interesting twist. 

Nose - orange peel, black tea, honey, and black pepper, and a bit of rye and baking spices
Taste - spicy orange at first, with some soft honey sweetness, a bit of black tea adds complexity
Finish - the honey fades quickly and the rye spice lingers, there’s enough heat to get your attention"
3.75,"The bottle I actual had was the bottle in bond four grain, but unfortunately Distiller doesn't have it in their archive and I wasn't able to take a picture of the bottle!

I will first say that i was a Big fan of the E.H. Taylor four grain bourbon and since I won't pay $700 for secondary prices i though I would try this AD Laws bottle at the Whiskey House in San Diego. Overall I will say this is a pretty darn good substitution and all the grains mingle very well with each other. I like the four grain because it isn't your typical bourbon profile so if you like whiskey that a little different i would recommend this one."
