3.5,"Tasted from bottle: No. 58 of 428, from casks 5794 & 5796.

Nose: Somewhat remote, floral and fruity notes (apple, pear, light citrus), sherry and a little smoke.

Palate: The arrival is honeyed oak, where sweet fruity flavours combine with oak tannins in equal measure. A rich and well-integrated mouthfeel, sweet nuts and a charcoal flavour.

Finish: Long, with a caramel flavour lingering into the finale and a little tannin.

This is a whisky caught right at the last moment of its life. If it had been left for one year more the tannins would have completely sublimated the distillate personality and all the fruity notes would have vanished, leaving it very dull and lifeless.

As it stands it’s a pleasant whisky with that certain elusive quality of “maturity” that you know when you taste it, but which defies description. However age is all that it really has going for it now and I can’t help but feel that it might have been better 10 years ago when it would have carried greater flavour, and probably been more reasonably priced. Personally I’d prefer to buy a bottle each of the OB 12 and 18 year instead of this.
