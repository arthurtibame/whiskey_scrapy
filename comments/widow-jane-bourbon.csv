4.0,Probably one of my favorite.  The New York water from that mine definitely does something special.  This is a sourced bourbon and is brought down to proof with water from the Widow Jane mine.  They are starting to distill their own bourbon but it is very young and doesn't taste anything like what they have sourced.  I think it's overpriced for a bourbon they don't even distill themselves in my opinion.  But it does scoop the tongue with flavor.

      Nose is stronger this time, still floral, but with more traditional bourbon notes as well - wood, brown sugar, baking spices. In short, smells good. I taste some cola, cinnamon, walnuts, cherries. Much more complex than I remember. Warm going down. Finish is still a bit short. This was much better this time around. 5/26/17 Tried the 10-year version. Nose was nice, floral notes, wood, and a hint of... plastic. But it works. Smooth and silky on the tongue. The flavor is unique, and there's an earthiness that rounds it out, like truffles or mushrooms. The spice lingers. 1/13/18"

4.0,Widow Jane/Cacao knows her esthers. Yes the caramel sweetness on the nose with a little more tingle twinge than many bourbons. On the palate a faint tropicality (perhaps informed by my drinking it in Bermuda as the first ever import here) but also a faint oily sea foam not unlike an unpeated single malt...
2.0,"I tasted the 8 year for the first time yesterday. I was highly disappointed. I really wanted to like it but it fell short in every department. Everything about it was off. The nose was almost musty, the body was flat and the finish left a bad taste in my mouth. Not my ""cup of tea"" at all. Certainly not worth $70."

N: Like a better Canadian Club, with lots of light caramel tones, except not disgusting
T: Similar to the taste, light body with caramel... and then as it opens, a wonderful surprise of deep natural tobacco flavor. Like a sour, well-cured blend of ribbon-cut white burley.
F: exactly like chewing tobacco, with the same kind of bitter and sharp notes like you would get chewing tobacco... sour bitter leaf tannin and nicotine spice.

Really pleased by the tobacco notes this whiskey presents. Definitely does the theme well. Not one-note, but a great exploration on the theme."

3.0,"For some reason, this costs a relatively reasonable $13 a pour at my local bar, in line with the basics like Knob Creek or Bulleit.  Anyways, compared to those, I'd give this one the call maybe a third of the time, opting for the other two the rest of the time — it doesn't stand head and shoulders above them, in other words.  Relatively one note, albeit a pleasant note, on the nose and palate, with a heavy dollop of maraschino cherry.  For a 10-year old bourbon, this is not oak-heavy, although there's definitely evidence of cask influence.  I've seen a lot of reviews claim that this bourbon has a strong chocolate note, but I'm not seeing it — fudge, maybe.  The most unique feature of this bourbon is that, although sourced from the Midwest, the company uses New York mineral water to dilute it down to its bottled proof.  Not sure I can really tell the difference, but there's a slightly bitter or grassy quality, reminiscent of lemon rinds, at the end that may be a result of that New York water."

3.0,"Barrel No 1635, Bottle No 73, Date 2017
Classification: Straight Bourbon 
Proof: 91 (45.5%)
Age: 10 Years
Mashbill: Undisclosed
Distillery: Sourced by Undisclosed Distiller in KY
Bottled: Widow Jane Distillery, Brooklyn, NY
Price: $60 - $75
Color: Medium Copper
Nose: Brown sugar, apple, vanilla, smallest hint of smoke
Palate: Sweet, Smooth, vanilla, brown sugar, pepper, slightly reminiscent of creamed corn
Finish: Short-Medium, heat dissipates quickly into sinuses, little rye spice, pepper, hint of black tea, subtle vegetative note similar to cabbage
Personal Rating: 6.5/10
Notes: When the whole thing between Chick Schumer and Mitch McConnell happened, I was curious to see if Brooklyn really did make some of the best bourbon in the world. My conclusion: Meh. 
It isn’t bad by any means, but doesn’t blow me away. At first it feels like a regular traditional bourbon. But the finish is quick and you really have to focus to identify specific notes in there. It is also very surprising that a 10 year bourbon isn’t oak forward in the slightest, honestly I didn’t pick up any. Maybe the weather in NY doesn’t allow more much in the way of additive from the barrel during aging? Whatever the cause, I was hoping for a little more “maturity” out of it. However, the nose and initial sip are pretty good. Drink it how you like it, no need to add water with the low proof but not so remarkable that making a cocktail with it would be over the line. It seems a little pricey for what it is, so if it is on sale, why not grab a bottle. Otherwise, just order one up at your local watering hole if you want to give it a try"
5.0,"One of my favorites. Well balanced, good substitute if you don’t have Blanton’s at your disposal"
3.0,"This fell really short for me. Nose is standard, light alcohol despite not being in a Glencairn. Sweet raspberry, cream, and spice in the finish. Not a $70 bottle though."

I also have a May 2018 Jane's Addiction Private Selection Single Barrel 12 year 99 proof.  Again, a $90-$100 bottle that is decent enough, but at this price range, there are more complex bottles I would choose.

4.0,"A friend of mine introduced me to this fine Brooklyn Bourbon.  It is a rich copper colored liquid in a simple bottle with a white label.  I really dig the simple look of the bottle. It makes me think of the old time western elixirs the snake oil salesmen would peddle in the movies.  As for the bourbon, it is a 10 year old, 91 proof, Kentucky sourced bourbon that is blended with rich NY limestone water that helps make this a beautifully smooth drinking bourbon.  
At first sip you get a nice warm flavorful medley of vanilla, carmel, oak, mocha, and a pepper spiciness that blends together perfectly.  The warmth you sensed at first taste progressively builds into a smolder as it progresses toward the finish.  You can now taste baking spices and a subtle earthiness that the limestone water imparts on the bourbon.  These flavors all round out nicely in the finish, which isn't too long or hot as you might expect it to be at first taste. 

All in all this is a solid bourbon to add to your collection.  At the current $65 - $70 price point I think it is a little overpriced for what it is.  In my opinion you are paying a surcharge for the marketing of their ""mine water"" story and the Brooklyn ""hip"" factor more than flavor, which leads me to rate it a 3.5 to 4 out of 5."

3.5,"Reviewing Batch # 65, Bottle # 104 from 2018 release.
It's been a couple of years since I have bought a bottle of Widow Jane and going back to my review from the clearly enjoyed it. The biggest issue has been that it was not in my market until fairly recently (picked up the previous bottle from NYC) and the price here is $79.99. However, as per usual Costco came thru with a big discount and at a sub $50 price point I decided to buy another bottle. It's also important to note that this is now a batch product (that changed with the 2018 releases) versus the SiB it previously was so I am expecting some variance in profile. Before I dive into the review some facts about the bottle:

1) It's 100% sourced from MGP, Dickel and an undisclosed KY distiller. 
2) It's age stated at 10 yrs old
3) Its non chill filtered
4) It comes from an extremely small batch of 5 or less barrels.
5) It's proofed at 91 and brought down to this proof by limestone water sourced from the Widow Jane mines in upstate NY (hence the name)

On to the tasting:

Upon entry you get a really big dose of rich brown sugar, vanilla and a hint of clove. Mid palette adds a spice swell with pepper and cinnamon added to the clove leading to a long oak, tobacco and vanilla driven finish. Spice notes come back as well and there is a good amount of heat for the proof on the finish. Despite it's relatively low proof it's pretty viscous and has a nice mouthfeel. All in all a well constructed if unremarkable Bourbon. 

The main sticking point here will be price. At it's SRP of $79.99 it's a hard pass for me (I would drop my rating a full point at that price). At that price point I expect a lot of complexity and some uniqueness which you don't get here. At the price I paid I think it's a fair value and am very happy with the purchase. It's a really nice Bourbon, just not special. I would not recommend spending north of $60 on it. As a comparison to the old SiB, unfortunately the batch product also comes up a bit short. This one is definitely sweeter no doubt due to the addition of the Dickel component and less complex. 

So in conclusion if you see it for under $60 and like sweeter Bourbon, this is a good buy for you. Cheers all!"

I don't have the palate to say that the mineral water is what gives this such appeal to me (I grew up in South Jersey drinking hard water with a high iron content), but I will never turn this down.

Tasted neat. Only neat. I would drink it with a straw if I wouldn't go through it too quickly."

3.75,Nutty and rich on the nose. Sweet with some floral components on the end. A base earthy component through it all. Solid

3.5,"This is very comparable to four roses single barrel. Almost the same, except this has less cinnamon on the nose and a softer palette. If your considering this but wary of the price I’d highly suggest getting Four Roses Single Barrel first for half the cost. If money isn’t an issue I’d tell you to get both bourbons, have some fun and blind taste test them together. 

With that being said, this bourbon is delicious and you will enjoy it, but you can find a cheaper alternative in Four Roses single barrel if price is a concern."
3.5,"Cherry cinnamon vanilla on the nose with slight alcohol burn. Much smoother on the pallet than you’d expect. I love having it in my collection and i love drinking it but $80 is a little high for it. I’d buy Henry McKenna for half the price before i buy this again. However, i don’t regret buying it one bit."

4.0,"The nose stars hot but mellows to vanilla, baking spices, oak, some smoke and the faintest hint of ripe fruit. The palate comes across marshmallowy and vanilla, with just the right amount of oak balancing it out, along with cooked sugar and a fruity sweetness. The finish is medium and full of vanilla with fading oak and a touch of brown sugar."

4.5,"Nose: toffee, vanilla cinnamon

Taste: honey, oak, cherry 

Finish: long and hot with a Smokey note."
3.75,Very nice upfront and finishing flavor. Very smooth with a bold taste
3.75,"Cherry fruity, brown sugar, sweetness fades, oaks"
3.75,"Tastes high proof and strong, tons of wood flavor and caramel. Blend well but very aggressive, would have done better with a bit more richness to compensate. Like the fire though."

4.25,This was one of my favorite bottles as long as I had it. It's easy to get too. The only con is the price tag. Upwards of $90 for this beauty. But a great pour with flavors that cut right to it. Singular and great (even if Widow Jane - the company is a sham)

2.75,Nose is deceptively sweet and traditional bourbon notes. However taste is bland and short dry finish. Very disappointing after the nose. Revisiting this bottle after about a year of opening. Wouldn’t recommend for value.
