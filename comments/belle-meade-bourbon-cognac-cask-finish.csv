4.0,Tasted at the distillery in Nashville. Much lighter than the Sherry finish (and better) with tart crisp notes and vanilla on the finish. Their best product behind only the single barrel releases.

4.0,"$100 Carothers select cask 

Oak, brown sugar, nutmeg, and spices on the nose. On the palate it's rich and full bodied and boy does it hit ya. This bottle was 123 proof but I could sip this neat all day long. Oak and nutmeg on the finish."

4.0,"Very nice.  Just a hint of rye spice and a short burn make this easy to drink.  Some finished whiskeys are overly sweet, but this one seems to strike a good balance.  I will definitely be grabbing a second bottle to set aside - my first will not last long."

null,Just okay. It was the second of the five tastings. Least favorite as it was lacking taste unlike the others. More caramel than hearty flavors

3.0,Sweet and spicy nose. best with a bit of water in it to bring out the spiciness. Starts with sweet apples then goes to a nutmeg or cinnamon spice

3.0,"This is a cheap bourbon in an expensive barrel.  You don’t get to split the difference and charge $80, when it is this obvious.  The nose is fine and interesting, giving you the impression that the cognac grapes will play well with a young, vanillaic and nutty bourbon.  But even the nose does not justify the price tag; it’s sharp, awkward, and trying too hard.

On the palate, and especially the finish, the cheap bourbon is exposed.  I’m reminded of Leadslingers, Larceny, and Four Roses Yellow Label.  There’s that sawdusty wood, raw walnuttiness, artificial cinnamon and fruit flavors.  I certainly haven’t had a bourbon for less than $30 per bottle that I’ve come close to enjoying.  This attempts to hide such a bourbon with the XO Cognac.  It does okay at the beginning, but by the finish, the premium cooking whiskey that this is becomes apparent.  Next time, I will try to make this flambe with pan-seared shrimp

null,"Has a drying quality as compared to their sherry and Madeira, but plenty nice"
4.0,"375ml in a three-bottle special cask finish series box.  Batch no. 18-04, bottle no. 1331.  Actually a great deal at $99.99, as buying the three bottles in 750ml totals $225. Tasted all three in a row, Cognac-Madeira-Sherry.

Neat in Glencairn at home.  Nose has vanilla, orange peel, some nice sweet spice (if that's a thing).  Taste brings out some oily notes from the cognac cask, grape must, candied orange peel, clove, apples. Lingering oil and spice.  Nice.  1/30/20."

4.25,"Cask no 4917  Bottle no 130    @ 116.5 proof

Nose, doesn't jump like oloroso sherry finish but the cognac is an oh so sweet and nice addition on top of this already well thought out bourbon.  This one isn't as in your face as the sherry nose, it's more balanced and complex, but a much nicer overall character. 

The front loads up nicely with cognac sweet grape then proceeds into some beautiful rye and bourbon notes, spicy yes but with a number of caramel candy and red fruits to go with the bourbon brown sugars and vanilla.  Just a great texture, perhaps the higher proofed barreling than the sherry finish is what does the trick along with the high rye expression but this one stands out nicely as a well perceived and executed product.  The fantastic tradeoff of a slightly less robust nose for a much bigger and bolder bourbon-rye body on the palate is easily a big win. 

Finishes like a nice barrel rye and bourbon with sweet heat, really I couldn't wait for the  follow up sip, this was nearly the antithesis of the sherry Belle Meade that just gets you excited only to disappoint you in the end. 

For the bourbon and rye fans this is a definite recommend, the cognac is a 'just right' addition in the flavor spectrum and provides just the positive boost of sweet character that you would hope for from such an experiment. 

Count me as somewhat surprised after the sherry attempt, but a big thumbs up on this Belle Meade expression as a winner."
3.5,"Loving the initial notes on the nose and the cognac characteristics that arrive with it. On the nose: rye spice, strawberry, cherry, light fruit and vanilla. Taste is sweet and easy, but lacks character. The finish brings back the notes from the nose and compensates for the palate. Final Verdict: 7-7.5/10. It's a smooth, easy drink. If you have it at your bar, this may be a great whiskey to sip on with friends who are beginning to enjoy whiskey. If you don't have it, I don't see it being worth the 65-80 USD. Plenty bottles to choose over this for half the price.

3.75,"Compared to the sour mash and sherry cask, this falls short of them."
3.75,"Got the three pack gift set of BM cask finishes. 375ml bottles for 89$ not a bad deal to try all 3. This is first up and you guessed it the lowest of the three. This is not a major demerit as its still quite good. Poured neat, nose is rich and sweet. Candy cigarettes , mini marshmallow and honey blend with a floral essence and waxed hardwoods. Glass at rest yields butterscotch and rye spice with just a pinch of dill. Palate is spicy rye with bullseye crème caramels and polished oak. The vanilla is robust and tasty. The floral vibe envelopes the whole experience and has cognac like qualities. Finish is drying oak, lingering vanilla and rose petals. It drinks a little hot for proof but I kinda like that anyway in a spicy bourbon such as this. Overall cask profile is not my first choice and doesn't warrant normal full bottle price tag for me(around$70). Glad I tried it, I like it a lot but not enough to buy it...........87/100.....if this was 40-50 id be all over it"
4.25,Smooth with a nice finish
