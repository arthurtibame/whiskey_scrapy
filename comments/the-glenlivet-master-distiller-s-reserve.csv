Opened on May 28th 2016, and first drunk that night with kick off of the Champions League final between Real Madrid and Athletico Madrid at the San Siro."

2.0,"The nose is quite disappointing, smells rather cheap and harsh. The taste is just a little better, with a hint of orange. I must add a splash of water to enjoy this whiskey, it takes away the hard edge.

Should have invested a few extra dollars to get a 12YO Glenlivet rather than what feels like a travel exclusive reject."

4.0,Got two bottles and love the smell of the whiskey. The taste is nice and not too intense. So enjoy an easy to drink whiskey.

2.0,appelsin og pære. veldig myk og søt med høy viskositet. beskjeden malt og ganske kort. sødmelag blir værende i munnen. lett å drikke men meget uinteressant og søt.

3.75,"""The (good) surprise of a tasting with 11 whiskies. Very quaffable! It reminds me a lot of balvenie doublewood 12 with its full body and strong sherry influence.

I was pretty sure this would be a crap whisky before I tried. What a great surprise! """

4.0,"Great peaty nose with a straight pour, open up the nose to get more floral with a drop of water."
3.5,"Time to try my first The Glenlivet! Which means I've returned to Speyside. Master Distiller's Reserve is 40% ABV NAS and I consider it on the entry-level shelf. This is tripple cask matured and it shows in the notes too.

On the nose I got a clear pear note that was ripe and a bit sweet with orchard honey. I was aware people got pear notes from The Glenlivet, I just didn't think they would be so clear! Fudge notes came through.

My palate did pick up a fair amount of oak from the start which I'm a fan of. It mingled with general spice and did have some tangy pear notes in the back as well. 

The finish for me mainly offered notes of sherry, with tannins that were more bitter than dry, spices still present.

Compared to the nose and palate notes the finish was not as complex. Something I've noticed from 40% ABV NAS drams. It was still enjoyable and I will have this as a pleasant casual sipper!

2.75,Needs more character and structure. Boring except the sharp finish. Still can make a easy drink for starters.
2.5,"Nose: Strong honey, oak, vanilla, slight grape, roasted nuts

Taste: strong oak presence, citrus and vanilla, benefits from a drop of water and airing out"

3.0,"May 2018
When I initially tasted this I thought it was a bit like the Balvenie 12yo Doublewood but subsequent visits have dampened that impression. It has a fruity (pear) aroma and the palate is also fruity but mild, with a sharper (but not overlong) aftertaste.
A 3 to 3.5 stars is what I'd pitch it and, once finished, not one I'd return to."

3.75,"This is the cheapest expression of Glenlivet's Master Distiller's Reserve editions for travel retail. 40%abv.

On the nose: new Wood, Herbal notes, wet Forest, dim Vanilla.

On the palate, Oak and Pepper. Thats it. Aftertaste medium, pepper and clove. 

Needed to add water to see if it can give something else: 

Water opens a dim and ""spicy"" apple on the palate

Overall i give this dram a 78 over 100"
