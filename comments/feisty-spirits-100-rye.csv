4.25,"Really intriguing! Tasted with an owner who described the flavors/aromas really well. Rye bread with raisin/date, clove, and allspice. The aroma was the best part, really complex. Distilled from a blend of Colorado and Canadian rye. The most-unique rye I've tasted, yet."

1.75,"It's not the worst thing, but it ain't good either. What wood notes you're able to pick up are green 2x4, not the beautiful vanilla and caramel notes you'd get from a typical barrel. Ethanol and moist cardboard drive the palate and the finish. Would be interested in trying at 100 proof after spending 5 years in a 53."
