3.0,"Decided to break into a semi dusty that was released 5 yrs ago as a US exclusive release. Limited to 12k bottles and priced at around $45 at the time this was a definite value purchase. The components are pretty decent with a 9 yr old Tomatin aged in ex Bourbon Barrels that are then finished for 3 years in New French oak casks. Non filtered without chill filtration and bottled at 46% ABV. In today's Scotch market this would represent an impressive value... Let's see how it tastes. 

On the palette it's got an airy feel. Fruitcake and vanilla lead... Some red fruits on the mid palette with a decent caramel, apple and big oak finish. It's astringent and takes a bit away from the overall experience. Maybe a bit too much time in those French oak Barrels.
Overall it's super enjoyable and a decent value at $50 but nothing more than that! 

Cheers all!"
