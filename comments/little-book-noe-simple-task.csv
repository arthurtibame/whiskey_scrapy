4.5,"Is this really 120 proof? Its way too smooth to be 120! Not a bourbon, very much a high end smooth as silk rye. Very light, in fact side by side with the 2017 ‘The Easy’ its much lighter in color. Doesn’t have the bite of a straight rye, so I’m thinking they did something brilliant here with the canadian whiskey rye blend. Bravo! I love it. Was hard to find, so when i found it, I accepted the price gouging and paid $110."

4.25,Spring time flavors of honey and sugar come through behind a spicy age sweet start. It finishes with a clean rye creaminess. A touch of water tones down the heat and let's the light spring time flavors come through. A definite departure from their other small batch profiles. I think the 80 ranking was a bit harsh for this release

4.5,"Neat. Opened over a year.  I haven’t had this in a long time, fun one to revisit.  The nose is so bright and delicate.  It’s lemon pine and floral. The rye notes are very delicate.  Hint of vanilla and mint.  Hint of walnut.  I would equate this to a cask strength Canadian Whiskey more than anything.  

Mouth feel is creamy, oily, and coating.  Quite pleasant.  Very sweet up front.  Oh geez, I like this more now than I remembered.  It’s definitely a different side of the flavor wheel.  The sweetness up front is just a delicate vanilla, almost sugar water.  But it blossoms so beautifully.  The vanilla transition into a lemon cello and then into a lemon cupcake.  Caramel frosting then emerges.  It darkens on the legs with a nice oak finish.

Sitting with it for a bit, the rye on the nose is taking the center stage.  The rye is coming out more on the taste too but blending well with the lemon aspects.

Okay, my memory of this one and the current experience do not match.  I remember liking it but also equating it to a lemon cleaning product.  Maybe the air time served it well because the chemical aspects of the lemon notes have blossomed into lemon cello and lemon cupcakes.  It’s really fun.  I think this one gets a raw deal on other reviews I have read."

4.75,"Little Book 2018, the second edition. I missed the first and I’ll probably never get a hold of it. So this is my first go at this line. Canadian rye, Canadian whisky, and Kentucky Rye. Should be an interesting blend.

Nose: Caramel, mint chocolate, vanilla, pistachio. Bready notes. Black pepper, clove, nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon. Big oak. A touch of maple sweetness. Rye is dominant. Some similarities with Willett 4, which I love. Good stuff here.

Palate: Caramel, vanilla, cola, and cocoa. Plenty of punch: all the ginger, clove, nutmeg, cinnamon, oak. Rye bread. Milk chocolate and fudge. Some cherry. A bit green and grassy, but not in a way that suggests youth. No shortage of heat, sweetness, and spice. Very enjoyable palate.

Finish: Mammoth finish. A blast of oak, cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. Caramel and vanilla. Beast of a finish. Long as they come, and reminiscent of Booker’s.

As a stand alone, this is a great dram. It’s different than anything I’ve had before. Features what I believe to be the oldest whisky I’ve had (40 Y.O. Canadian Rye)—and under $100.

Solid from beginning to end, and boasts a titanic finish. Lower ABV than any Booker’s variant with a finish that can stand up to the best of any Booker’s batch. Great showcasing of blended whiskey, Canadian rye/whiskey, and American rye. This one crosses several categories, many of which are under-appreciated. Well done, Beam."
0.5,$120 worth of disappointment. Practically un-drinkable. Just because it’s old doesn’t mean it’s good.
3.25,Sweet and fruity on the front with a strong hint of spice on the back end. It was hot straight after opening the bottle so cut it with a little distilled water to smooth out the profile. Overall tasty with heat on the back end.

4.5,"Got to sample this for my buddy's 40th birthday. Came in a similar box as Booker's, just black. Beautiful presentation. Seeing the ratings from others, my expectations were pretty low.

Tasted in GC. No waiting around and neck pour.

N(3): Some type of citrus fruit soda. Other bright crisp fruits. Not complex. Does not nose like a 110 proof at all. 
P(5): The coating was so thick and cool. Flavor bomb. Bright fruits. Honey. Hint of rye spice. Very well rounded. Couldn't pick out much bourbon flavors other than vanilla. 
F(4.25): Rye bread. Oak spice. Orange creamsicle. Medium finish. I wish it was longer because it was so good.

Overall: I've never tasted anything like this. Got me real interested in Canadian rye, because there's a 40 year old in it. Next type of whiskey I'm jumping into. Highly recommend if you want something different. Giving it a score bump because of the uniqueness. I would definitely pick it up if I can find it at MSRP. Be careful, very easy drinker and super flavorful."

4.5,"I had previously reviewed this in Distiller but noticed the review disappeared (user error no doubt!) I have now had 3 pours over 3 nights and am really enjoying this dram! I decided to rewrite this review as I felt this was an exceptional dram!
It's a cold night in the Phoenix valley and I have just enjoyed a phenomenal steak dinner. So what's better to wash that down with then some good Whiskey! As a control, I decided to start with the MidWinter Dram. I had previously commented that I felt this one had a comparable flavor profile and wanted to validate this tasting them back to back. I knocked out a 2 oz pour of MidWinter (Act 5 Scene 6) and moved to Noe Simple Task.
On the pallette it's just so soft and approachable. Even after drinking a much lower proofed Rye there is no pallette shock. I get Rich vanilla, cocoa and dried fruits. What's so lovely is you have clove oil in the background giving this dram wonderful depth. Mid pallette is a big dose of toasted oak and rasberry jam. It then moves to a big oak and buttery butterscotch finish with some old leather. Then as a final act you are left with lingering rye and clove spice that tingles on your tongue to go with the big Kentucky hug! It's a special pour. The fact that it's stands tall next to and I would argue is superior to the MidWinter Dram packing an additional 20 proof points is a great achievement. What's more impressive is it's accomplished without the benefit of cask finishing! The clear star is the 40 yr old Corn Whiskey that lends complexity and depth to the rye Whiskey components. At $69.99 it's an absolute steal. At $100 MSRP, it's a solid buy. Rye lovers seek this out! Cheers!"
4.5,Flavorful with very smooth caramel and vanilla and the burn from the Rye is awesome
4.5,"On the nose: caramel, sweet tea, and soft rye.

On the palate: oak, syrup, allspice and anise.

On the finish: spices fade to a dry, sweet, and mild black licorice."

4.75,"When I saw the expert score I thought it must be a typo. Booker makes fantastic bourbon, so even a blend is unlikely to score less than, say, Famous Grouse. Well, it’s not a typo but it is a mistake. This blend of American and Canadian whiskies somehow brings the best of both to the table: the rich Demerara of bourbon with the voluptuous spice of long-aged rye. It’s sumptuously smooth despite checking in near 60% alcohol, and gives a long, warm, rich finish. This is a combination that needn’t work-Alberta’s Dark Horse tries to marry rye and bourbon and it ends up a mess-but Booker’s Noe Simple Task has managed to hit the perfect blend. Don’t mind the expert; take a chance and enjoy!"

4.5,Smooth to the nose with hints of pound cake and floral smells. Smooth taste with just enough heat on the back end to keep you warm on a cold night.
4.0,"I feel Noe Simple Task isn't worth the price, 100.00, If I'm going to spend 100 plus on Rye I'm buying Peerless.
Neat: It's got heat but weak on spice and flavor, the rye spice is very faint.
With some water: The RYE stands out I get the mint, seems to have more going on with water than neat. 
This is my first time tasting it only had a small pour.
I'll update later after I have a good size dram and time.

UPDATE 11/24/18: I originally had this a 3 bumped it up to a 4. I keep forgetting I'm tasting a BLENDED Whiskey (8 year KSR, ""40 year old"" Canadian Whisky and 13 year Canadian Rye and not a Bourbon or straight Kentucky rye. I've never had any Canadian Rye Whiskey straight/blended. This bottle is like a high test Canadian Rye Whiskey. I don't have a good nose so I don't give results for scents/smells.

I can't believe Little Book put 40 year old Canadian whiskey in this blend and at what percentage. Would've liked to seen this sold deconstructed along with the blend to taste each part of the recipe separately and complete.  
Sat down an had a neat dram and another with a little water.
Neat this time I could taste the rye more, has heat and spice but light on the oak/wood. Once again this Blend opens up great with water or a ice cube, the rye comes out even more.
Overall it taste good. Would like to see Little Book priced at Bookers price. I need to try some Woodford and Crown Royal Rye whiskeys to help me get a better idel of this blend."
3.5,"I find that doing a new whiskey each year is a very maverick thing to do in this whiskey realm and very often pays off.  Some years will be a miss and some hits.  Let's see what chapter 2 holds.
COLOR: much lighter then expected with a gold straw color.
NOSE: cereal malt grains, spring florals, cinnamon, toffee nuts.
TASTE: cough syrup, dark cherry, fig.
BODY: oily richness, coats very well and settles.
FINISH: up front a splash of cold oil that heats up rapidly to a blaze then slowly settles down. finish is long and the residual flavors are very enjoyable in there muted forms.
OVERALL:  This is not for the beginner or faint of heart, packs a punch with its mixture of high rye and high proof.  I enjoyed this one but I will say the 1st edition was better slightly with less fight in it.  As always keep drinking my friends... Skol!"

 Nose:1/1 
smells great corn caramel
 Taste: .5/2
 flavours are not harmonious burn and mouth feel is awful and I drink cask strength often and worst is adding water gives it a rancid liquorice flavour :(

Initial reaction on taste was surprise and confusion.  Going in again, I notice more dark notes on the nose like cinnamon so it’s evolving.  Initial palate is light sugar and vanilla.  It’s odd.  When you first swallow it’s almost tasteless about then explodes.  Like a sonic boom has that silence before the noise catches up to you.  Once it pops, it pops for waves and for a long time.  Mostly those high notes from the nose with the vanilla and citrus.  Little spice from the rye and cinnamon poke their head in to say hello.  This is the longest tasting note I have ever written.  This one is interesting.  It’s good, solid, not blowing me away with the flavors.  But it is blowing me away with its uniqueness.  One to revisit for sure."

Taste - There's a lot more rye on here.  Rye bread, spicy, a bit hot, and a caramel finish.  There's a bit of toasted bread.  A very light touch of peanut just for good beam measure.

Overall a nice middle of the road rye flavor with a bit of bourbon caramel and a touch of nutty notes.  100 bucks...hard to recommend too strongly but it's pretty good and at a tasting this one was second place among people's favorites next to some real stunners so clearly there are some fans."

4.5,"Procured Dec 18, for 85USD and I call that a bargain.   I put The Easy up against George T Stagg (2017) and found it could go toe to toe, now let's see what Noe Simple Task is made of--   opened in Dec 18 and sitting minus a shot for over 6 months now. 

Nose: Spiced rum cake yes, sweet caramel toffee(werthers), some dark, tart jams, currant maybe.  The rye spice is a secondary hint with the alcohol, both being barely noticeable.   This is one tempting nose and certainly a great start.  I get no barrel wood, nibs or bitters, whatever the 40 year juice is contributing it certainly doesn't register as a standard northern whiskey.  Perhaps The Enigma would have been another good name for this one.

Front: There's that canadian hooch, and there's the high proof heat with it, the dark and low fruit from well aged juice is apparent, as is the nice corn-rye blend but also a rich and spicey combo of really good rye spices and fruit sugars.  I can see why this throws off some tasters as an unusual juxtaposition of flavors, it is a fairly unusual profile but also a delicious and richly satisfying treat. 

Finish: some small salted nibs but mostly sweet leftovers of caramel and fruit, no real changeup to the profile on the backside while it tapers down easy.  This is another really smooth high proofer that shows the care and craftsmanship from the best of the best of Master Distillers. 

On repeated tastes the rich corn bourbon sugars step up and dark fruit sweetness keep pace with all that rye spice, this is actually much better balanced than I had initially thought on first appearance and tryout.  The first sample from months ago clearly needed some opening up and patience is a virtue for those who acquire this bottle.  

My initial thought was this was a bit of a disappointment as a follow up to The Easy,   after all you don't see a bottle that can stand up to the best of the G.T. Stagg offerings every day, but this is clearly another huge power player in the best of custom crafted whiskeys.  Another thumbs up for Booker's kid."
