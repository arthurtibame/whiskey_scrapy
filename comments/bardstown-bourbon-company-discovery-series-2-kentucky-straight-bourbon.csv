5.0,"Excellent bourbon from a company doing some real creative blending.

Nose-Maple sweetness jumps out of the glass, some cinnamon spice and leather notes are underneath the maple with a dash of fruits, mostly reminds me of pears

Palate-rich and complex, lots of oak tannins, some of the maple sweetness from the nose appears

Finish- lingering, creamy sweetness and cinnamon

Verdict-While the price tag on this bottle is high, it is worth it for people seeking a rich, complex and oaky bourbon.  One of my favorite bourbons of 2020 so far."

3.25,"I was really excited about this one. Heard some great reviews like It's Bourbon Night, try before your die whiskeys. Lucky I was able to get a sample of it, with an MSRP of $120. I was able to find it in my area for this price and almost purchased it. Might of been my pallet after trying the William Heavenhill, th ediction 12 year. That baby was 134.4 proof!

1 ounce sample in a GC. Allowed it to breathe for 15 minutes

N(3): Got a funky musk. The aroma was there but nothing really jumped out. Got a little bit of fruit sweetness. I had a couple of big sniffs after the first tasting, still no real change. I've had more come out of Buffalo Trace or Wild Turkey 101.
P(3.25): Not complex or bold. It's good. Got some cherries and a bit of mint. Adding another quarter point because the mint was delightful and not overwhelming.
F(3.75): Wow...this baby was hot. Punched my throat. I'm pretty good at handling high proof, JDBP, ECBP, Stagg Jr. After the second sip, it gave me heart burn. But the flavors were good. Vanilla and sweet oak with a drop of citrus. Like a young orange."
