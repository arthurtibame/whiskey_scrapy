3.0,"Great nose. Smooth palate, tastes a bit young but it's still pleasant. Lots of vanilla and a great soda effervescent note at the end. Fruit at the end, with a pleasant bitter note, like dark chocolate. 10/27/17"
4.0,Amazingly smooth and nice flavor but difficult to detect and work out the flavor. Not much in the way of nose. Light body

3.75,It’s nice.  A bit young.  By far the best thing I’ve had from Breckenridge.  Priced a little too high for the age.

3.0,distinct smell of Oak and maple wood on nose along with witch hazel. Tart taste which opens up considerably with an added ice cube. spicy finish with wood notes added
3.0,"Nose has notes of oak and maple.

Tastes of spice and maple syrup with low sweetness. Rough burn."
3.0,"Nose: oak, raw rye flour, black pepper, faint cherry.
Palate: dry heavy oak, cherry jam, vanilla, fades to bitter coco. Rye spice throughout."

4.0,The Tawny Port barrels used in this dram adds an interesting twist to the port finished trend. Less sweetness.

4.0,"Cinnamon, sugar, red wine, ash on the nose. Smooth palate with first hits of mulling spices, heat, char, and oak. A dry port finish with a smooth and medium finish. A dash of water serves well to open the flavor profile, but a cube mutes it a bit too much and crushes that warm, wintry mouthfeel."

4.0,"Very sweet nose with a powerful cinnamon blast on the back end. 
Very rich and full mouthfeel, but not as oily as expected for a high rye. 
Rye is prevalent in the taste but is quickly (and pleasantly) masked by what I can only assume are the effects of the port finish. I swear I can pick up faint, sweet grape and tannic oak. Very nicely compliments the rye punch. 
Well worth the money. I’ll grab another before it disappears."

4.5,"This is the port finish section of my barrel finished bourbon bracket. This is a blind taste test of Isaac Bowman vs Breckenridge.

The tasting of Breckenridge:

The nose is so delicious. It’s got cherries, grape, raisin, vanilla, and cane sugar. While I do think sangria, I don’t only think sangria. I can pick those scents out individually, which to me is the mark of a good whiskey.

Body hits first with caramel. Then the port hits hard, but in a good way. Mostly cherry and sugar, but the other nose flavors are there if you look.

Finish shows off more of the underlying bourbon. There’s lemon and sweet fresh bread. Is a lemon scone a thing? It’s some sort of tart desert, and it’s fantastic.

For me, Isaac Bowman won out, but it was close. IB capitalizes on more of the sweet tones in port in a magical way (AE does this too.) I’d claim Breckenridge does an equally good job but with the dry tones. Nose and body of Isaac Bowman won for me, but I’d probably give the finish to Breckenridge. Overall enjoyment of IB makes it the champ.

I really like what Breckenridge did here. They marry good bourbon to the port finish, and it makes a solid product that tastes more like a work of art and less like an attempt to join a fad. It’s the most expensive port finish in this competition, but it’s worth the money at least once.

Port finish summary:

1st - Isaac Bowman
2nd - Breckenridge
3rd - Angel’s Envy
4th - Boondocks

Disclaimer: I bring up AE a lot, and usually in an unfavorable light by comparison. I wanted to take a second to say: I actually really like AE. I have limited releases from 4 different years, a bottle I personally filled at their distillery, a display stand made from a barrel stave, and a laser-etched glass all on its own shelf in my whiskey cave. Geez that was weird to type out. Used to be simply a man cave, but apparently I’m being honest with myself tonight and speaking harsh truths about what my basement has become. Point is: I respect AE a lot for what they have done and what they have inspired in the bourbon community, this whole current experiment I’m doing included.

That said: when an underdog comes out and puts up numbers on a reigning champ, you can’t help but get excited. And that’s really what my AE remarks are all about. Isaac Bowman knocked my freaking socks off. It is the best port finished whiskey on the market. And now, this one comes exceedingly close to winning, beating AE for me in all the categories except cost and nostalgia. Dollar bills be damned, I’d probably keep this guy on my shelf. But as the most expensive 2nd place finisher in this competition, I probably won’t. Shelves are only so big, you know?

EDIT: out of laziness and nothing else (didn’t want to juggle 3 glasses up a fight of stairs) I poured Angel’s Envy, Breckenridge, and Isaac Bowman into one glass. The result may be better than any of the drinks individually..."

4.5,"Loving this rye bourbon. Sweet, caramel nose. Stays consistent from the front to the back on the taste. Big rye flavor with raisins, but also a bourbon sweetness that sticks around well after you finish. The port cask really comes in at the finish as well, with that port wine sugary lingering well after."
