3.0,"Wasn't a big fan of this, if you prefer Canadian or Irish whiskey. You'll be at home here, for the rest of us it just doesn't pack enough punch. Good for mixing I guess, but you can do better"

3.0,"I hoped it would be better than Jack. Truth is they're just different. Dickel is probably Jack's soft spoken mistress. Reminds me of melted candy corn at first and then I can taste the slight sour I'm accustomed to finding. This has almost no bite to it and limited flavor from the casking. The final taste is like burnt cupcake frosting. A bit too soft for me but at least it probably doesn't unlock man'a inner animal the same way. Might be a while before I renew this on my shelf over other choices.

Later notes, after the last second Sparty trumping of Baylor (watch Lippett string out kicker Callahan for tough nose MSU football) I felt celebratory and made a new drink. Add three fingers of no. 12, four cubes ice and four Michigan cherries. The ice cuts out the sweet and brings the wood/nutty out. Cherry gives a slight tang. I call it the Dickel Tickle. Spread the word."

3.0,"Smells like a bourbon with vanilla and caramel in the nose.  The taste is very smooth with a bit of a drying feeling on first sip.  This is a good whisky and has some nice corn sweetness with some mellow wood spice and smooth vanilla and caramel on the palate.  Overall, well worth the money and a hell of a lot better than JD in my opinion.  Not complex or overly interesting but a good competent drink neat, on the rocks or mixed.  If you swear by JD, you should really try Dickel and give it a shot.  It's hands down better in my opinion and the same price."
3.0,"It's ok, not what I expected. Nose was nice, warm, cherry, vanilla, oak. Very nice. First drink was on the rocks and it killed this drink. The flavour was weak and kind of off putting. Second drink was straight and it was much much better. Oak, butter, hint of dried fruit, vanilla sweetness with spice,. Overall Not a bad whisky for the price. But stay away from the ice."

2.0,"There is no bourbon/Tennessee whiskey on this green earth that so acutely serves as a reminder that bourbon/Tennessee whiskey is made from corn. This stuff is just distnct corn flavour throughout. Cornmeal, corn-husk, corn flour, creamed corn. There's also some sugar maple, vanilla, pencil shavings, barrel char, and light banana. But your tolerance for this one will depend on how okay you are with drinking alcoholic corn juice."

3.0,"Another quick stint to Maryland to see family. Stopped by Roland's in Chesapeake Beach to pick up a something new to share.  This was the bottle of choice. The familiar bourbon nose of corn, brown sugar, vanilla, ground cinnamon and oak char are immediate.  As it opens, with a bit of patience, subtle hints of bananas can be found.  Oak tannins dominates the palate on arrival.  Brown sugar is briefly revealed, segues to a small amount of char and quickly fades back to the dominant and primary oak and cinnamon spice characteristics.  Finishes just as it arrives with a with a trace of black pepper.  The addition of water/ice tempers the oak and enhances the sweeter side and is preferable.  A decent sipping whisky (their spelling) but somewhat safe and static.  A better quality, punched up (45% abv), more defined whisky than the Old No. 7.[Dry Glass: Brown sugar and nutmeg][$25][85/100][Opened: 10/24/15; 4/8/16;10/28/16]"

Taste morphs into something different, almost unexplainable. Not unpleasant. Hints of almond, Ritz crackers and sorghum.  Different from other bourbons and may take a couple of tastings to get used to flavor profile. Two and a half stars; worth rounding up to three."
4.0,"One of the better kept secrets in American whisky. Toffee, butter, caramel, a little coffee, corn and oak. It's probably the buttery taste and buttery mouth feel that keeps me wanting more. A great daily pour of classic Tennessee whisky. Most of us native Tennesseans  know who the best distiller is - and it ain't the folks in Lynchburg. We call George Dickel 'The Doctor' for a reason. Bought my last handle of GD 12 in the Nashville area for about $31 in May 2016. Fantastic,  delicious value."

To me they share the common Tennessee whisky notes, sweet corn, oak, charcoal, (with the exception of Jacks vanilla sweetness and nutty notes, dickel has more of a brown sugar sweetness). I strongly recommend you drink them side by side, the flavors of these notes are a lot different. But to me, the biggest factor in defining yourself as a ""jack guy"" or a ""dickel 12 guy"" is the feeling. Jack snipes you down from a mile away with a sharp alcohol bite (even at 80 proof, and dickel at 90 proof, still has way more bite) and it's flavors flatten on you. very open flavors, very  bland (gentleman jack tightens more and much more flavorful). While dickel has a very warm, tight, rich, and flavorful feel."

Buttered with cheese, cheese with caramel (the best, especially if you get more cheese than caramel corn), and what I'm now just gonna call the George Dickel. The nose here is buttery popcorn and caramel corn together, with a pinch of spice. The palate keeps the buttery texture and puts the caramel popcorn flavor forward, with baking spice and black pepper at the end. Smooth, easy to drink, and a good value."

3.0,"Nose: Cereal mash, ethanol, a little caramel, some leather and orange, oak. A somewhat dry and hard nose. Not unpleasant, but very bready and cereal-forward and certainly not soft. A touch of toasted coconut.

Palate: A sharp and spicy arrival with wood in the background. Something floral or aromatic herbal. Quite dry overall.

Finish: Medium, tannic, very dry and frankly a bit rough and metallic.

This one was not to my taste at all until I added a teaspoon of water. This helped a great deal by taming the ethanol on the nose and the rampant hard spices throughout, and unleashing a wave of sweetness. Not that it suddenly became Jack Daniels-like sweet, it just all seemed to come into balance and focus.

I don't think I've ever said this about any other spirit but this is one that I'd prefer to buy bottled at 40% instead of 45%. At 90 proof it feels like I'm being shouted at by the village idiot - dropped to 80 there is a pleasant conversation going on.

Not a particularly complex whiskey, but great when diluted either with some still water as a sipper or with soft drink.  I certainly prefer its dry profile to the other big Tennessee whiskey's sweetness. It goes very well with cola, not so well with dry ginger, but very well indeed with coconut water (try it - you'll like it).

A great standby all-purpose bourbon to keep in stock.

4.0,"Dickel 12 (a recipe number, not the age, akin to Jack Daniel's No. 7) is the less famous of the two major Tennessee whiskey houses (take a wild guess at the other one).  It's also the better one, albeit one with a more unique profile that might not suit all drinkers.  As you'd expect from what essentially is a bourbon, the dominant mix of flavors are vanilla, caramel, and some citrus fruit.  However, there is a chalky or vitamin-like quality to Dickel's spirit which reminds me of Springbank in the scotch world.  This expression also features some unusual spice qualia, particularly in the finish.  My wife identified cardamom as one of the last notes, so all credit to her for that one.  Hard to complain about something this good that costs around $25 a bottle.  As someone stuck in the shadow of a more famous name might say, ""They'll forget they ever heard about Jack Daniels."""

4.0,Has some of that buttery oak found in the Barrel Select but much sharper - has a brightness to it that is not present on the barrel proof - not flabby but challenging to the palate and the spice lingers a long time on the finish. This one I would buy. 87-90

were a dog my head would tilt with a confused stare after the 1st sip... I see where some say it has a “medicine” taste, makes sense. But it’s not bad, just throws me off. I’ll muscle this bottle down, but I will most likely steer clear in the future. I think this cost about 30 doll hairs in VA, worth that furshurr. 2.7/5 
Ok ok ok, the more I drink this the more it tastes good. Smooth and sweet aside from the charcoal taste. I drank more the next day and have to change my overall score to a 3/5. And, I will buy again next year on Vaca in VA."

4.0,"I haven't had this one in a while. I was reminded that this is always a good pour. The nose is sweet with notes of banana pudding, caramel, maple and oak. It also has a mineral note that I couldn't describe until someone called it ""Flintstone vitamin"". Now that's all I can think of. However, not a deal breaker for me. Palate is sweet corn, buttered banana bread, and eggnog, balanced perfectly by a healthy dose of oak. The 90 proof is perfect. Nice warming finish without being hot. Paired this with a Te Amo Cigar and it brought this incredible sweet/oak note to the front. I will have to experiment with some different pairings. I didn't think the Dickel would stand up to the cigar, but it surprised. For mid-$20 price tag, this one is miles ahead of Jack."

4.25,"Dickel is the other Tennessee whiskey that most folks don't immediately bring to mind where Tennesse whiskey is concerned. It employs similar charcoal filtering, but instead of dripping it through the charcoal like JD, Dickel is chilled to around 40* then soaked in vats of charcoal about a week then barreled.  To be blunt, Jack Daniel's rules the roost in brand recognition, but who is king where it counts, i.e. flavor?   Let's find out!

Enjoyed neat, no added water.  Nose is certainly interesting and oddly what you smell may vary day by day.  One day I get sweet vanilla pudding with hints of maple, fruit, and oak.  Another day I can only focus on the mineral smells of Centrum multivitamins and sweetness.  Yet on another whiff I can call it sweet doughy bread with nuts.  I wouldn't call the nose too complex, but it's rather amazing the range of scents one can gather on this if you're looking for them.  Whatever the case, there is way more going on here than your standard JD!

With a high corn mash bill, the palate is very sweet and fairly light in mouthfeel.  Starts off with a hit of spiciness and warmth, but quickly followed by citrus zest, dark chocolate, leather, toasted sugar and smoky barrel char.  After the palate is fully adjusted, I get maple pecan biscuits.  Yum!  There can, at times, be a hint of the mineral like  multivitamin in the taste but it fades very quickly into the better palate notes.  While the 12 in the name doesn't suggest age of the product, this expression does have a bit more age (8+ years on average) on it than what most of its competition offers.  And I believe the longer aging is evident in the flavors that linger on the palate and long into the finish.

Finish is actually ridiculously long here and offers flavors reminiscent of a nice bourbon, that is predominantly maple and toasted sugars, honey, and oak.  Also a nice menthol and minty quality that is very pleasant.  Serioulsy the finish just doesn't quit and very long into it there is lingering maple and oak.  So good and this is only a $20 bottle! 

Overall, fantastic value at $20! Far more flavor and bang for the buck than its main Tennessee competitor JD No 7.  And I can say I like it more than some bourbons costing double than this Dickel.  While some may be understandably put off by the vitamin qualities in smell and taste, I wouldn't say this bothers me much at all, particularly as this isn't the dominate flavor of the expression, and quickly provides very tasty traditional bourbon notes beginning mid palate and continuing through the long finish.  

I'd say at the $20 price point, I can't think of much else that I'd rather pick up honestly.  Dickel 12 is quickly becoming my best buy in budget whiskey/bourbon!  It beats the pants off JD in both price and quality, offers more refined and complex flavor than other budget bourbons like Evan Williams Black, Four Roses Yellow, standard Jim Beam, and honestly this is more flavorful for me than something twice the price, like Woodford Reserve.  And while Gentleman Jack (my former preference for a TN whiskey) may be smoother and more mellow, it lacks the complexity and flavors of the Dickel and is much costlier.  Dickel 12 makes a perfect frequent sipper for the price, yet without tasting cheap.  Of course spend a mere $5 more and there are plenty of choices I like as much or more, like Turkey 101, Buffalo Trace, Jim Beam Black, Devils Cut, or particularly Distiller's Cut, and maybe Bulleit depending on mood.  It's great to have so many fantastic choices for so little $, but if you're truly sticking to a hard $20 or so limit or just want to try something new, you'd be hard pressed to do better than this great Tennessee whiskey in Dickel 12!  Cheers!"

3.75,"My second night of business dinners and I find myself at a local restaurant with a middling Whiskey selection. I see this one on the shelf and I recall @BDanner review and comments on this one being a good value Whiskey. So having yet to sample it, I decide now is as good a time as ever! 
On the pallette it's soft and sweet. Candy corn, toffee and vanilla are the main notes I get. Some corn bread and slight oak on the mid pallette leading to a medium finish with more vanilla, hint of butterscotch and oak. This one is lovely neat with pretty good Mouthfeel and so easy to drink. I dropped a little rock in and the sweet notes really opened up and I got a more pronounced butterscotch note.
All in all this one is a great value pick. Blows Old No7 out of the water and honestly, they don't even belong in the same conversation. It's that much better. For $6 a pour, I can't ask for any more. I will definitely buy a bottle and keep it stocked. This one is one of the top 5 values out there hands down!

3.5,"The Tennessee whisky has no less claim to being part of Americana as Kentucky Bourbon and if you want proof here it is.  G. Augustus Dickel immigrates to Tenn, in the early 1800's, he is a Nashville cobbler who dabbles as a whiskey salesman. George leverages the expertise of distillers Maier Salzkotter, as well as brothers Victor and Emile Shwab to procure the best product.   The sister of his new wife marries Victor and together they start the Cascade Hollow distillery.   State prohibition comes to Tennessee and their operation is relocated to Lousiville joined by the Arthur  Stitzel distillery, shortly federal prohibition slows the production to a trickle and George, well into his 70's retires.   When prohibition is finally lifted descendants of Dickel and Shwab relocate back to the Cascade Hollow area to start the second Tennessee Dickel Distillery. 

In spite of all this including the war and prohibition era, Dickel to this day is one of the truly American whisky(spelled like scotch) experiences thanks to the Dickel/Shwab families dedication to keeping this heritage alive.  If you're heading up 24 in Tennessee and see the Tulahoma exit you are but a few miles from the site of one of the real pioneer whiskey distilleries. 

So about Dickel No 12, those of you who grew up in the country no doubt at one time or another stuck your head in a corn bin, they are big round metal housings for raw corn storage that are anywhere from 500 to 150,000 bushels, and when filled with yellow gold all have a distinct smell of corn and corn dust.   With Dickel there isn't any mistaking that this is corn whiskey, the real thing, the heart of the run.

Nose, corn rows, row after row that go on for miles, on top of it the buttered popcorn affect and some hints of caramel and butterscotch. 

Front: sweet corn popped with butter and a nice werthers butterscotch, little bits of rye spice and malt tag along.  

Finish, just smooth butter, all that extra charcoal filtering pays off and you get no harshness of finish just a nice smooth ride out the gate reminding you of what corn liquor is all about.  The Dickel No 12 is smooth, really REALLY smooth.

Maybe not all that complex but an ultimate example of what smooth corn shine is like and perhaps maybe the last word on what Tennessee whiskey really is all about."
3.25,"I’ll keep this short and sweet on this review!
Nose: corn,nutmeg and flu stone vitamins
Palate: corn up front ,some creaminess, and a hint of spice . Almost a nutmeg spice.
Finish: is more of the same but pleasant 
82/100 
For the price it’s a solid pour that is slept on for whatever reason! Makes a nice decanter whiskey"

3.5,"I picked up a 375 mL plastic bottle of this for $12.95 in preparation for trying the new BiB offering. I haven't had GD 12 since college, so I could not remember how it tasted. I was pleasantly surprised how different this was from Jack Daniel's offerings, and how much cheaper all of GD products are compared to their TN rival. 

This is unlike most bourbons I've tried recently. When I've heard people describe cereal and corn dust for other whiskeys, I wasn't quite sure what they meant. Now I do. The corn dust jumps out of the glass for GD 12, with little hint of sweetness or fruit. I smell heavy corn with some oak. I may get a little butterscotch, but that could be because I've read numerous reviews. The taste is a little bit smoother and lighter than the nose, it goes down nicely. More bread/cereal on the taste. I get a medium oak finish that lingers but is not unpleasant. This is a really good budget whiskey, and the plastic bottle is great for camping trips."
2.75,"This may be suitable for mixing, especially around the holidays.  The maple finish is overpowering on my palate, and I doubt I'll be sipping neat again. The remaining notes are not bad, but complexity is lacking, and out of balance with the  maple."

3.75,"I’m an old dude with preconceived misconceptions that have at times negatively influenced some of my choices in life, Tennessee Whiskey (Whisky) is a good example. For decades I assumed Tennessee whiskey WAS Old No 7, man was I closed minded. It’s not that JD is bad, it just wasn’t the whiskey that rang my bell, I’m a bourbon guy. I don’t know maybe it’s a generational thing, maybe it was just me but you’ve gotta remember that 40-50 years ago the choices we had back then make up about 25% of the options currently available today. Factor in product distribution and market availability and in most cases you had Beam, Roses, Williams & Brooks with Tennessee being represented by Daniels, well JD didn’t impress me much so I wrote off Tennessee. I sniffed the Roses and chased those Wild Turkeys for the better part of 50 years... until someone gave me an unfamiliar bottle - and dang - I liked it... a lot! So I’ve been on this adventure for the last several years and it wouldn’t be right if I didn’t visit Tennessee again and I’m glad I did. Recent reviews I’ve read on this Dickel 12 were compelling enough for me to step out of my Kentucky bourbon comfort zone. If you want to know what Tennessee “whisky” is really all about, look no further. I’ll defer the tasting profile to @BeppeCovfefe, he nailed it - read his review of this. You guys that follow me have made this a fun journey, wouldn’t be drinking this one if it wasn’t for you - thanks & cheers!"

3.0,"Very similar to most other brands of whiskey, George Dickel has a colorful story behind it and it has been appropriated by Diageo, who now owns the brand.
George Dickel was a German immigrant. He opened Cascade Hollow Distillery in 1878 after earning a reputation for selling quality spirits in Nashville region, which probably means he sourced from other distillers. He chose to spell whisky without an ""e"" specifically to honor Scottish traditions.
After his passing, his wife Augusta Dickel and business partner Victor Schwab continued to operate until the Prohibition, which was enacted in Tennessee in 1910.
It was rebuilt close to original location in 1958.
The label itself gives certain clues on how Dickel is made. ""Sour mash"" means that a portion of the mash is set aside and added to the next batch. ""Tennessee Whisky"" has to be made in namesake state, consist of at least 51% corn mash, aged in virgin charred oak barrels, contain no color or flavor additives, and be filtered through maple charcoal. Meeting these requirements also means it can technically be a bourbon as well, which has all the same requirements except for the first and the last.
In keeping with Dickel's preference of distilling during winter months to produce a smoother whisky, Dickel chills it's whiskey to 40 degrees before charcoal filtration.
Mashbill is 84% corn, 8% rye, and 8% malted barley.
On the nose there's vanilla, honey, stewed apples, and slight ethanol burn. With a high corn content, it's not surprising that the palate is very sweet with brown sugar, honey, and simple syrup. There also a slight taste of fresh lumber and charred oak. Mild black pepper spice on the finish that is replaced with more sugar sweetness and slight astringency at the end. It is definitely sweeter, mellower, and smoother than Jack Daniel's."

2.5,"Musty corn, vanilla, children's vitamins, ethanol and cherry cola on the nose. More corn, children's vitamins and cherry cola on the palate plus some heat. The medium finish is a somewhat bitter. A splash of water made no difference."

3.5,"Haven't had this for years. Charred oak, vanilla, and a dry grass and corn sweetness, disappearing into wood with some alcohol burn. Love the memory more than the whiskey now. It's not a premium whisky, but... be generous."

3.5,"Light amber color, very light aroma with sweetness, sweet on the palate, mid palate continues with some spice very little heat.  This is an exceptional smooth whisky that is very approachable.  An every day sipper at a great price.  My price is for the 1.75L"

3.25,"Maple syrup on the nose, with the same initial hit on the tongue. Transitions to an oak and leather middle before a spicy finish that lingers. Great on ice. When served with a large whiskey ice cube, the middle opens up to a smoky and sugary middle prior to the oak and spice. Very sippable without losing flavor on the rocks."

3.75,"Wanted to try this for a while so finally picked up a bottle. Poured neat, oily legs brings nose of smoky vanilla, a unique mineral note (some have described as flintstones vitamins in a negative fashion but I really like it) and rich custard. Palate is creamy custard, vanilla soda and smoky heated char. Finishes with fading vanilla custard and oak with char. This is delicious stuff. The charcoal filtering has brought some different flavors and depth. Carries good heat with 90 proof yet smooth with balanced sweetness. Yes it is significantly better than Jack Daniels and I highly recommend if you like Tennessee whiskey......89/100...... definite repurchase"

3.0,"Very distinctive mineral vitamin nose with your more typical bourbon notes, hits the palate with sweetness, corn syrup, chalky vitamin, and a medium finish that resolves with oak and vanilla, cherry on top. A profile I could pick out of a blind for sure!"

1.0,"Smells nice, but as soon as it hit my lips everything it touched burned.  Not like a mild burn, more like satan's nightmare type of burn.  After a long few seconds the burn subsides, and the taste takes me back immediately to every Sunday as boy where one of my chores was to clean my Mom's ash trash from the carton of cigarettes.  
With a lot of ice, and perhaps a 12oz coke it may be ok, but overall this is not for me."

4.25,"Very interesting nose - in a good way. I’m thinking sweet, candy scents, but not overpowering or too sweet. Not quite sure what I’m smelling except I know I want to get to the tasting portion. Delicious flavor with vanilla and slight banana. A decent finish but leaves fairly soon. Overall a good whisky at a good price."

4.0,"This is a very good whiskey to drink. I have only had Jack Daniels to compare this to and it does beat the pants off of JD. I would like to try this side by side with regular JD and Gentleman Jack to see how it ranks against those two. It is a Tennessee whiskey through and through the charcoal is right there waiting on you when you open the bottle. That is not a bad thing if you like Tenn whiskey. I want to thank Ctrexman for saying the part about ""Flintstones vitamins"" taste because it does describe the taste very well. I really think this should be the face of every day drinking Tennessee whiskey and not JD. I am really looking forward to trying the GD Barrel Select. Enjoy."

3.5,"Nose is nutty on this one as I often find at this price point. Taste is a bit flat to be honest and not very dynamic. The general whiskey profile is there, it just isn't very strong. A little vanilla, a hint of brown sugar, but nothing coming through very strong. Finish is a light pepper burn with a pleasant caramel close. An ok pour overall."
4.0,Very smoky rich and sweet. Very smooth sipping whiskey.

5.0,"95/100 might seem crazy but I can explain why I personally think this deserves a 95. George Dickel 12 is like a premium jack Daniels with maturity, more complexity and added levels of sweetness. The nose is so sweet. Fresh cornbread, caramel, honey, maple and faint barrel char. The nose also smells shockingly mature, no noticeable alcohol. The finish is extremely sweet and smooth. The dram also isn’t extremely watery. At $26 good luck finding a more enjoyably sweet American dram. Dickel 12 kicks butt neat or in a drink. Unbelievable for the price."
