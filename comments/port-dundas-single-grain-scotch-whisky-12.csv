3.0,"Smooth and vanilla; very easy drinking. A little one-note and tasteless, but easy drinking. Probably a good intro Scotch due to almost no burn, smooth vanilla flavors, no smoke at all. But for the regular drinker a little boring. Not bad, just boring."
3.5,"Very Light, delicate, sweet, caramel. Great as an introduction for those new to scotch."
