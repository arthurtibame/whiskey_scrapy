5.0,"I'm giving this a 5 star rating based on value. I can't believe the reviewer gave this an abysmal score of 65 - it's actually VERY decent Scotch for the bargain basement price. Picked this up for $21 locally. It delivers a general 'Islay' experience for an incredible price. Smell is typical Islay smoke; on the palate it's sweet and rich, if a bit thin. The aftertaste is strong peat smoke and a little saltiness.
Overall, it beats the brakes off the other Scotches at the same price point (Johnnie Walker Red, Cutty Sark, etc)"

3.0,"67% This scotch provides a nice visual and a diversified palette of smell. Sadly, a strong presence in mouth of peat and a iodine aftertaste leaves the vanilla, the smoke and the fresh lemony side somewhat in shade. Good scotch, but nothing more."
3.0,"As stated before, this is the only real choice for single malt islay under $50 (which it is half the price of). Plenty of peat smoke, but a little on the sweet side and lacks the dry after taste of many other islays."

4.0,"I have to agree with the value-related positive assessments here.  This is not a sipping snob's dram, no.  In fact it is even a bit rough.  But as has been said, it credibly offers the ""Islay experience,"" at a price that can easily make you overlook its shortcomings.  Laphroaig and things like that are still worth buying, but for mixing, you can hardly afford NOT to buy this.  (There may be others in this category, but this is what I've found in Savannah, GA.)"

1.0,"This is the worst Scotch I have ever had. The palate is nothing but smoke and there’s no complexity here whatsoever. If you think the taste of a camp fire to be appealing then perhaps this one is for you, but I’d recommend spending just a bit more and getting something more robust."

4.0,"My first ever peated scotch.  I'm not ashamed to say I thoroughly enjoyed it.  That is, until I decided to go online and read the nearly unanimously awful reviews.   Suddenly I wondered if there was something wrong with my sense of smell and taste, or perhaps me in general.  No... There was nothing wrong with me.   Just a lack of experience... For I was an Islay virgin before that dram.  However I am now cursed as I hold a dear nostalgic bond to this now admittedly rather sub par peated offering from bowmore.  I lost my Islay virginity to McLellands Islay single Malt, and for that reason I will always long for it.  I could smell an intensely chocolaty sweet aroma from the glass almost five feet from my nose, and as I sipped the smoky spirit from my newly purchased glencairn glass while gazing through a large window at my snow covered street, I felt as though I was being warmed by a well fueled fireplace on a cold winter night.    I had never tasted anything like it before.  The campfire smoke filled my nostrils, and the clay/plasticine finish reminded me of my early days in kindergarten when I would sculpt what I considered to be masterpieces.  From my earliest memories as a child, to my happiest memory as an adult sipping scotch by myself in the dead of winter at 2am... McLellands Islay single malt brought me to a place and set me down a path that no other Scotch whisky had or could have before.   I owe my love of peated scotch to it... 

Today, malts from Lagavulin, Ardbeg and Laphroaig reign supreme, but on that particular night it was a young bowmore that had my full undivided attention.   She was objectively not the best looking, but to me on that night....A goddess."

Palate: Tar, iodine, sweet raisins, bonfire smoke, peat, a strong yet comforting sweet-salty brine reminiscent of the sea, lemon peel, cask bitterness, wood spice, a hint of smoked ham, honey

Finish: Bonfire smoke, peat, dried fruit (raisins, sultanas, dates, apricots), medicinal notes, a smoky briney-sweet flavour that is perfectly intertwined remains for a while, rubber, chlorine, iodine, gunpowder (think cap gun shots), a bit of oak is there too, sweet syrup, slight hint of peach"

2.75,"Given the prices of standard offerings for Islay, I thought I'd try this since some whiskey somms do appreciate it as a budget offering. Supposedly it is young Bowmore, which I've never had. The only Islay I've had besides this is Ardbeg 10. The McClelland hits you immediately with smoke on the nose and I get nothing else. It is surprisingly light on the taste/mid-palate. But the finish tastes kind of like cheap artificial smoke you'll find in food, not nearly as tasty as Ardbeg 10. I don't get that meatiness you would get from the older peat. 

If you really like smoke this could be a good budget purchase, it is about half the price of your 10Y malts. This has taken me a while to get through this bottle, and I'm very hesitant to try another McClelland. However, I do not think this whiskey is nearly as bad as the expert review on here, it's fine but it's just one-note smoke."

3.25,In my area it is far cheaper than any other Islay I can get my hands on. It does the job for scratching your peat itch but lacks a lot of complexity and interest salty components you may love in an islay. That being said if you love peat it is certainly worth a try for the money

3.25,"First peaty scotch. Interesting, I don’t hate it! Like a freshly put out campfire"
2.5,"I love the smoke so was looking for a low cost Islay to try as most are well over $40. This was only $20, went in with low expectations as reviews were mixed. At least its a single malt and theory is its from Bowmore as they own the McClelland brand(some speculate 5 yr old). Poured neat, clings to the glass pretty good. Solid peat smoke, bandaids and olives on the nose. As it opens the smoke wanes a little and salty cured meat moves in with some malt. Thin oily mouthfeel brings more sweetness than expected. Its malt, caramel and brine with char. Has a fatty/greasy note that comes as sweetness fades. Still brings some smoke but not as much as nose promises. Finish is medium with ashy smoke and greasy char. This lacks the refinement, intensity and complexity of the true peat monsters(such as Ardbeg).. its not on that level but is priced accordingly. What it does have is Islay smoke, good maltiness and a budget price, this bests blends in this range imo. Its not for everyone though, its kinda dirty and rough around the edges. It did grow on me though as I spent time with the bottle. I would pay the extra and get the real deal but for $20 this is a good cheap Islay intro. 75/100 ........If this is the Bowmore throwaway stuff Im looking forward to trying what they actually put their name on"
3.25,Started my scotch adventure in this app with this. Price point is good for me to start. I'm a bourbon guy and I'm not sure how to review this. It's got the sweetest of a bourbon. I'm expecting more of a low tide vibe has some flavors I don't understand. Smooth light finish.

If I didn't know that flavoring was illegal in Scotland I would think the smoke was fake. Very strange experience. If you already have this bottle and can't stomach it neat, you can try adding a dab to other budget non smoked drams. Fun to experiment with, still can't do it neat!"
