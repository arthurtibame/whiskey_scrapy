2.5,"I really wanted to like it more but it has too much of a ""moonshine"" taste due to its young age.  It is very smooth and well-executed but I keep thinking they released it way too early and it is a bit underdeveloped.  Too much grassy/corn taste, not my own cup of tea but not bad.  I strongly believe that it will be a very good whiskey when it will reach 4 years.  Maybe my expectations were too high because of the fabulous Belle Meade Cask Strenght that I bought recently.  Good value though, I look forward to seeing what they release next.  On a side note, it is a really great distillery to visit."

3.75,"On the nose I get some smokiness, corn, some soft wheat notes and hints of bread and a slight smell of a rickhouse.

Its fairly light and juicy on the palate. It has some corn sweetness. Some light leather/musty notes and a slight smokiness.

The finish is medium in length. Not hot, I get some corn as delayed aftertaste.

I like this one, but I’m somewhat biased because I have been waiting for this release for a while.
So this one is aged a minimum of 2yrs. I’m sure there are some 4yr or so barrels blended in there. But all in all, it shows it’s youth. As their stock gets older, future releases of older aged whiskey will be very good.
I was really excited to try this fully aged in normal sized barrels variety after having their short run of First 108 which were aged in smaller barrels for a shorter period of time to “accelerate aging”. They are definitely related, but I think I like their First 108 a little better, it’s also a good bit darker than this new one. Probably because it had more surface area with the wood in the smaller barrel?
Anyway, it’s good and different, and would recommend it."

2.5,Tastes very young. Promising but needs more time in the barrel.
3.0,"This is just ok. Quite briny on the nose. And man oh man, it’s hot. Tastes really young. Pretty strong ethanol."
3.75,This is a little tiny distillery in the middle of Nashville

3.25,"A soft amber color, with a sweet aroma of vanilla and a little bit of ethanol.  Soft mouth feel, that hits the front of the tongue and then the sides with a slow slight sweet honey flavor wash of taste over the middle of the tongue, the flavors slide down the throat with just a hint of heat.  I really like the flavors of this whiskey it is very pleasant."
3.5,"Ever since trying it at the actual Nelson's Distillery, I'd been on a quest to find that beautiful oak and caramel note that I found at the distillery. Today, I'm proud to say I found it again. After sitting with it for a while, the caramel finally hit me in a beautiful way and I nearly wept. It should be no surprise that nosing is my favorite part of the tasting process and as that caramel/creme brulee flavor wafted into my nose... I was elated. I finally found that flavor that made me fall in love with Green Brier again!"
3.25,"Originally loved it when at the distillery, but the flavor profile seemed to change when I got home. The caramel apple notes I got at the distillery seemed to be replaced with strictly wood and corn notes."
3.5,"Spicy, sour.  Lives up to the hype."

3.0,"Nose: this is a really strange nose for a bourbon. On the nose it has a hint an anejo tequila. Very strange! It is rounded some sweet corn, but that anejo alcohol note is inescapable. You could argue that it is briny, but it smells like tequila to me.

Palate: young and woody, spicy and drinks hotter than its 91 proof. Still smooth, a slight nutty flavor and also slightly bitter from the youth and barrel. The tequila-esque bite does show up again though. Strange!

Finish: medium finish, still tasting the wood, with a sweetness on the finish.

I have to say that this is slightly disappointing after tasting Nelson’s First, the two year preview batch aged in small barrels. I will let this open up for a bit and give it another go. I think barrel selection didn’t do this any favors, but there is a silver lining to this otherwise lack luster review. 

It is an interesting Tennessee whiskey, which is something you cannot say for a lot of the bottles in this category. At its price point of $29 to $35 it’s worth a taste. I think the Belle Meade stock is getting the best barrels and this is getting the b-stock. I think a lower entry proof, a few more years of aging, and being more selective on the barrels could do this wonders. 

I’m a fan of the NGB distillery and I am confident they will get this right before the national roll out. The Belle Meade line is superb and I think this will get there, eventually.

Update: After letting this bottle open up for a few months I went back to it. The strange nose has dissipated although there is still a hint of the tequila smell far in the back ground. Now it it sweet, sugary maple with a nose close to brown sugar oatmeal. Much better than before.

The sweetness comes through on the palate, again sugary maple, sugar cane, sweet breads, with a little bitterness, caramelized sugar, and bread on the medium short finish. You can still taste the youth of this whiskey, but it is better and more interesting than a lot of Tennessee whiskey in this price range. Probably too sweet to mix with cola or really sweet mixers. Original rating was 2.25 and I’m adjusting it to a 3."

4.0,"The true beauty of whiskey comes from the fact that it evolves and changes from taste to taste. It can give hints of caramel and oak on one tasting and cherry and orange the next... That still doesn't explain how the hell I smelled pure southern Cane Sweet Tea when nosing this damn stuff! I'm not sorry for it at all, but it was shocking! I got the sweet tea nose and then an almost cornbread taste that lingered into the taste of flour. It was like pure Tennessee in a glass and I can't explain it! I think I'm going crazy"

1.5,"Like others have said, very young. Tastes way more like white moonshine than a bourbon. Relatively smooth for something so young so it gets some love there"

4.5,"Such a sweet, welcoming whiskey with lovely hints of vanilla, black tea, and caramel.  A little spice rounds it out and welcomes you into this original Tennessee Whiskey. Really nice fruity notes on the palate with an almost chocolate-cinnamon finish. The Green Brier Distillery is always a must-go when I head to Nashville."
