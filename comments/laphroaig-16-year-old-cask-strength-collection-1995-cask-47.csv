4.0,"A sample of a different 16-year-old bottled by Signatory found its way to the Modern Drinking HQ, a 1997 vintage bottled for K&L Wine at an ABV of 55.2%. To the typical Laphroaig nose add notes of violet and a hint of dairy - Crème Anglaise perhaps? The palate is muscular even with a teaspoon of water and distinctly Asian in flavor: soy, tamarind, tom yum, black tea. The tamarind lingers for a tangy and slightly sour finish."
