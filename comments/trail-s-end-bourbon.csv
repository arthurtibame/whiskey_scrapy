5.0,"Fell in love with this in one glass. It is a great bourbon for the scotch drinker. It brings refinement and subtlety to straight Kentucky bourbon. Honeysuckle, apricot, and orange blossom with hazelnut and chocolate. Warm finish,  malty & spicy with slight smoke."

4.0,"I was pleasently surprised by this Oregon finished Bourbon.  It is spicy and full but smooth and flavorful.  The aroma is sweet and airy, with a great feel in the mouth.  It  is an easy to drink bourbon with a great easy finish.  I am a fan!   It might deserve 5 stars..."

3.25,This is a good one. Lots of brown sugar and oak on this as well as a whiff of baking spices.
4.5,Yum
2.25,Really disappointing.
3.75,"Visited the tasting Room in Hood River, OR and bought Batch 004.  This is an 8YR age-stated KY Straight Bourbon Whisky finishes with Oregon Oak staves.  This tastes like a toasted barrel bourbon.  Very smooth and a classic bourbon profile with a subtle woody toasted note, which reminds me of toasted graham crackers almost.   Very enjoyable, unique bourbon!  7.7/10"

3.0,"Batch No. 2, revisited after sitting half empty for around a year.

The bazooka Joe, anise qualities have lessened. In it's place, I get more of a light creme brulee.  Maybe, again, it's because I had this after having a number of other tastings.  But the flavors have definitely improved.

My only complaint is the lightness of the flavor and shortness of the finish. No burn, even with my nose in the glass."

4.0,"I bought this on a whim (as usual), when Elmer T Lee was STILL nowhere to be found. I live in Oregon, so this spirit is widely available...The bourbon is sourced from Kentucky and re-bottled in Oregon white oak barrels...I really was surprised at the great taste and smoothness of this bourbon...A great value at $34.94 for 750ml.  I RECOMMEND this spirit to anyone wanting to enjoy a mellow sipper with touch of spice."

2.75,"A let down.

Interesting nose. Reminded me at first of Willet Pot Still Reserve, but then picked up peppermint and bubblegum qualities as it opened up with a touch of cinnamon and anise. Really reminds me of of Bazooka Joe gum.

Taste was light, but okay. May have been because I tried this after some stronger stuff (like Booker's 2018-4). In any case, there's that Bazooka Joe again. Also, some light herbal notes, wood tannin, and dried fruit (lightly apricot?).

Sadly, I consider this a waste of $30-40. IMHO, could have been better spent on or applied towards something substantially better."

3.75,"This is one interesting pour. It's always interesting to see what kind of influence an oak finish will have and in this case it's pronounced. This is an 8 yr old Kentucky Bourbon (most likely Heaven Hill stock) finished in Oregon oak Casks. Now call me niave but I didn't expect a big shift in the classic HH flavor profile. I was wrong. Right upon entry you get classic brown sugar and vanilla notes but are then almost instantly hit with a really unique note. It's like fresh cut oak and smoke combined! The sweet vanilla, and candy corn come back in a medium finish that also has some subtle spice. 
Originally I put this as a 3 star pour but the more I sip the more I enjoy it. If you are are fan of peaty Scotch and Bourbon this will be right up your alley. Nothing else tastes quite like it. Cheers all."
4.0,Batch 003 is a must have.
