3.5,"Tasted on 11/14/18 at Whisky House San Diego
Like the other reviews said, the flavor is nice, but it is not overly complex by any means."
3.0,"Knockando, most uncommon here is the North America (or at least in my region). A pour starts my late evening.  I purchased via proxy from @LeeEvolved for our whisky group.  This was distilled in 1998 and bottled in 2013. Aged in European oak sherry and refilled bourbon casks, but for how long in each, I am unsure. 

It arrives on the nose lightly sherried and sweet. Canned mixed nuts, dark chocolate, honey, vanilla, raisins and cereal (Raisin Bran). Some tropical fruits of honeydew and apricots.  A pinch of cinnamon and oak are sprinkled about.  A rather inviting nose. 

The body is medium in weight that arrives sweet and turns spicy.  The sweetness is light brown sugar, vanilla and honey. This sweetness segues to the spicy notes of cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg.  A ying/yang balance of sweet and spice. 

It finishes, long, of oak, cloves, cinnamon and almonds. The tongue rides out a soft tingle to completion. 

A solid opening draws you in. The palate, however balanced, is  two dimensional and you find yourself wishing for a bit more and the one dimensional finish wishes for a more two dimensional finish.  It’s a good pour and easily drinkable.  For a 15 year, I do expect a bit more. [$48][84/100][Tasted: 7/6/18]"
2.0,"Thanks to @Scott_E for this sample.  I’m gonna do a quick review on this, since I’m lined up to finish round 6 (been dragging my feet this round).  Here it goes:  pour 2 of 4 for this evening.  I can still type.  This is about $50. I’d not buy it.  Would I get a pour at the bar?  Nope."

3.0,"Back to another sample from our little trading group:  Knockando 15.  The Knockando distillery is located in Speyside, right beside the anCnoc distillery and began distilling way back in 1898.  The Gaelic translation of Cnoc-an-Dhu is little black hill.  This distillery’s claim to fame is that it was the first one to use electricity back in 1905.  It acquired it because it was directly beside the Great Northern Railway that connected the highlands to the larger cities in the south.  It’s currently owned by Diageo and approximately 10% of its malt is used for single malts, the rest of its 1.8 million liters per year go into J & B and Spey Royal blends.

This one is bottled at 43% and is a light gold in the taster and produces slow running, oily legs.  I’m sure it’s chill filtered and has added color.

The nose is mixed nuts and sherry with some breakfast syrup and fresh oak.  The palate is heavily wood forward while coming across as very thin.  There’s more oak than anything else, but I do get almonds and the faintest sherry notes.  The finish is medium length and warming, while leaving behind lots of oak tannins and pepper.  

Overall, it’s average and serviceable, but I doubt I’d buy anything else from these guys.  Thanks to @Scott_E for the pour- we can tick this one off and keep on moving towards the finish line.  2.75-3 stars.  Cheers."
3.0,"Stop number 90 on the SDT is Knockando. This Speyside distillery is neighbors with the Knockdhu distillery, which goes by anCnoc to avoid confusion. This 15 year old single malt is not available here in the US and had to be ordered from the U.K. Bottled at 43% ABV and is chill filtered and probably has colorant added making it an amber gold color. 

Nice sherry on the nose. Licorice, nuts, vanilla and maple. Some weak mint, syrupy sweet and more sherry. Oranges, melon and pecan pie. Some chocolate, apricots, a little floral and notes of black tea. Fruit punch, light sanded oak. Cinnamon, light clove and some ginger. Very nice, if not too complex. 

The palate is sweet and spicy. Not a hot spicy, but wood spices. Cinnamon and cayenne pepper, the flavor of cayenne but without the heat. Sherry, light oak and dark chocolate. Nutty, pecans and Brazil nuts. Oranges, apricots and plums. Perhaps a raisin or two. 

The mouthfeel is light bodied, mouthwatering and mouth coating. 
The finish is medium long with sherry, nuts and bitter chocolate. The bitterness persists and is a bad note on which to end. 

Today happens to be World Whisky Day and while I would have liked a better whisky to commemorate the day, this one was not bad. I was hoping for a bit more complexity in a 15 year old, but the flavors are good. The bitterness on the finish hurts it a little, but the nose is great. At $48 this is a great value for money, but not when you have to take international shipping rates into account. A solid 3.5 and thanks to @Scott_E for the sample. 
Cheers"
3.0,"@Scott_E might be the whisky savior of the evening. After having a couple of drams that didn't bring me the flavor, I think we've found one here. The nose has strawberry pop tarts, roses, cinnamon, and light syrup. The palate brings more cinnamon, but balanced well with powered sugar, vanilla, butter, cream, and a nice oily medium mouth coat. The medium finish lets the butter, cream and spices linger on a bit. Not overly complex, but a solid 3.5. The sherry and bourbon casks here are well done. The theme of this dram should be ""Caught in the Balance"" by Toto."
