2.5,I feel a bit like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day when it comes to how many Scottish Distilleries I still have to try. Each time I think several more to go and several later I still have the same number...so after a sober and thorough stock take I now have exactly 7 more to go and that is that..until the newer distilleries come on line. Ah grain distilleries... where would I be without them...drinking a lot better whiskey for one thing.  I could carbon copy my review from any of the latest TBWC grain reviews. Its balanced and not harsh but that's about the positives. Sickly DR Pepper cough syrup etc...down the sink it goes. 2.5
