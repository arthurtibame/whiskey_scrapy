2.25,"2.3/5.0. Light and sweet but a bit rougher than expected.  Primarily minty notes.

Light honey water coloring and very thin... like simple syrup made with raw sugar.  On the nose is minty ethanol, with a hint of vanilla cookie sweetness.

The palate immediately offers candied peanuts, transitioning quickly to mint julep flavors, then to some vanilla hard candies.  Very very thin body with a quick and sweet but astringent finish."

3.5,"This was on the clearance rack at Bevmo. I read the reviews and they weren't very encouraging, but I'm a sucker for a sale, so I bought it anyway. This is a bottle from batch 66.
On to the tasting. I get cotton candy, candy corn, pralines, rye and a fair amount of alcohol on the nose, the palate is sweet and smooth with a hint of cola and the longer I held it the hotter it got, the finish was hot to me and seemed to last a long time with the cola and candy corn hiding in the background."

1.75,"Unfortunately, the most disappointing whiskey from Smooth Ambler. On the nose caramel, vanilla and alcohol. On the palate a bitter burnt oak and not much more"

3.0,"Of all the whiskeys I've tried, this was the most extreme example of one needing some time to ""open up"". 

Binny's had a few bottles on clearance for $25, so I picked one up to try despite the mixed reviews. The first taste was borderline undrinkable. Almost entirely ethanol on the nose and palate, and an uncomfortable burn the whole way down. Basically something that belonged in a plastic jug for $5-10. 

After sitting out for a bit though, this mellowed out a lot and actually became a very tasty whiskey. Sweet on the nose, with the ethanol present but not overpowering. I got a ton of peanut and caramel on the palate, with a sweet & spicy finish. I'm not sure if I would spend MSRP on it, but if you see it for $25 by you, it's definitely worth a try."

3.5,"Nose: Brown Sugar, Oak, Caramel Alcohol
Tatste: Spice, Corn, Powdered Sugar, Alcohol
Finish: Medium, something on the tail end. Reminds me of Absolut only on the sides of the tongue though. 
Not bad at all. More like a high end mixer."

4.0,"Nose is apples, malty notes, minerality, touch of Carmel and oak. Palate gives corn, oak, tartness, dark brown sugar and soft oak spice. The finish is okay sweetness, powdered sugar and a boozy tart note."

3.0,"Bit harsh. Strong alcohol on the nose, some spice and caramel sweetness on the taste. Short finish. Much improved with a few drops of water.

3.0,"The nose is slightly spicy with honey, barley, brine and a bit of a meatiness. The palate is somewhat dry and smokey, with a dull honey sweetness and oakiness coming forward, with cooked sugar and barley behind it. The finish is short to medium with fading honey and a cinnamon spiciness that lingers."
4.0,"The more I drink this, the more I like it.  A very good blend, rich and smooth."
3.0,"I taste mint, a little bit of vanilla, and a bit of oak in this whiskey. The finish has just enough spice to keep the flavor in the mouth for a decent finish."

3.5,I like the Smooth Ambler bourbons better.  Somewhat similar base taste but this sure has more rye. With the rye spice and the near 50% alcohol burn I added a little ice.  I didn’t realize how sweet it was prior to adding ice.  Good not great.
