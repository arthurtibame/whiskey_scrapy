3.0,"Not the Solist version, but the La Maison Du Whisky 60th Anniversary Small Batch bottling. 52.4% ABV

Nose - (w/o water) Hot, sweet tropical fruits, light sweet smoke, pineapple, coconut, Tahitian vanilla, bananas. (w/ water) Bananas flambeed w/ white rum, coconut, pineapple, unburnt wood charcoal, grilled pineapple.

Taste - (w/o water) Fruity pepper heat, sweet fruity charcoal peat, grilled pineapple, sharp clean sweetness, like that of a heavily filtered pineapple juice (w/ water) Dry woody heat, grilled pineapple, light ashy smoke, cooked caramelized banana.

Finish - (w/o water) Lingering peppery heat, light ashy/metallic/iodine sweetness, bananas, pineapple, light charcoal. (w/ water) Lingering sweet woody tannic heat, clean light colored tropical fruits, smoked/grilled bananas, pineapple, sugar cane, lightly metallic.

Score - 79/100

Final Thoughts - This was an interesting one in that it portrayed a lot of the ""classic"" Kavalan malt I get w/ the clean tropical fruits. The aging in casks that formerly aged peated whisky was interesting in that it added this additional smoky layer, but I'm not sure I'm a fan. In addition to the smoke, it added this odd metallic note that I wasn't a huge fan of. A tiny bit of water tamed the initial hot heat a bit and brought out the fruit notes, but it also made it a tad bit more metallic. I'm a bit indifferent about this one, an interesting concept for sure, but I'm not sure it exactly fits my palate that well.

Would I drink it if offered? - Yes

Would I specifically order it? - No

Would I buy a bottle? - No"

5.0,"Absolutely amazing! Deep, thick, and chewy, with layer upon layer of widely varied complex, yet complimentary flavors. I have over 250 different whiskies in my collection, and this is hands down one of my favorites."
