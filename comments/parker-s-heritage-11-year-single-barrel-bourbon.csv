5.0,This is a delicious pour. Notes of oak and silky vanilla on the nose. The mouthfeel is coating and smooth with lots of creamy chocolate and vanilla. The finish is a tad short but there is very little heat for the proof. One of the best bourbons of 2017. Excellent edition to the Parker's Heritage lineup.

null,"It was ok,i wasn't a huge fan though. Nice on the nose. Palate and finish were just ok"
5.0,"So I grabbed a pour of this for 20 bones. Beautiful nose with very prevalent notes of vanilla. Great viscosity rich oaky tones while holding the vanilla. Delving in deeper I found honey covered crostini with a warm peppery finish. I don't think I'll buy it again, but I'm thrilled I got to taste it."

3.0,Drinks below its proof. Hits your typical bourbon notes; nothing to complain about but nothing to make it stand out either. Unfortunate price.
4.0,"Lovely sweet complex nose, hot thin complex body, sweet and spicy. Worth a try, not pappy, but very bold, complex and satisfying. Similar to bookers, but a bit more sugar Carmel"

4.0,"Spice, fresh linens, clover honey on the nose. Deep flavor on the palate, pleasantly oaky, sweet, baking spice, a hint of turpentine. The whole flavor profile lingers. A great Kentucky hug. Worthy of the PHC line. 5/12/18"

5.0,"Golden amber in color. Intense spicy oak on the nose. Manageable at cask strength but water really opens up the nose. More toffee and caramel and sweet fruit. Tons of flavor on the palate, all things expected from a cask strength Heaven Hill product. Very Elijah Craig-ish in nature. The finish is long lasting with some white pepper and more bitter oak, neither of which are a bad thing! Highly recommended"

4.5,"Nose- creamy vanilla, orange soda, black pepper, rich oak throughout, tobacco 

Palate- smoke and charred oak, spices, roasted nuts, orange, and corn on the cob

Finish- Spicy undertones with hints of oak and tobacco 

Bold and in your face, and anything but sweet. This is a fantastic bourbon that hides its proof on both the nose and finish. Nicely balanced and just what you would expect from an 11 year single barrel bourbon from Parkers."

4.5,"The nose is full of baking spices, oak, vanilla, sweet apples and a touch of port. The palate is very dry and heavy on oak, with black pepper, cinnamon, vanilla and caramel that slowly builds up as the pepper fades. The finish is long, warm and spicy with a mouthful of oak, fading pepper and vanilla and cinnamon."
