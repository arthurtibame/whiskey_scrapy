3.0,"It is absolutely dissapointing. This is a $1.000 dollar bottle. And i would not even pay $40 for it. Bottled at 40%abv, Nas, blended malt scotch whisky... tawny color, most certainly colored. You know i give high scores to good whiskies, this is not the case. 

On the nose it wasn't that bad, Honey, Hazelnut, red apples, Cinnamon, Maple syrup, Lemom after a while. Reminds me a little of japanese whiskies.Artificial aroma, Like sugar caramelized in excess. 

On the palate starts Hot and bitter. After 2 seconds some brown dry chocolate cake appears.  Burning sensation comes from a spice. Definitively liquorice in an unpleasant way.

Finish is mouth drying, a little bitter. Aftertaste with a simple cheap pepper. 

Overall i give it a very fair 62 over 100. For a thousand bucks.... man, what can i tell you...."

5.0,I loved this whiskey. Got the opportunity to try it at one of the Johnny Walker houses. I’m not well off per say so I don’t get to try high end scotch very often. So smooth and complex.

3.0,Tried this for the fist time tonight.  And its ok but has a harsh finish.  Cant belive they are selling it for $1300.  Gold is still the best in the range
