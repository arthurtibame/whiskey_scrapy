3.75,"Heaven Hill was the first distillery that I recognized as being a great distillery just based on the bottles that I was able to pick up locally. Elijah Craig, Evan Williams, and Henry McKenna were among the first bottles I discovered when I began this whiskey journey. Heaven Hill whiskies will always have a place on my shelf. 

But until recently I had not had the chance to try one of their signature bottlings, the six year old Heaven Hill Old Style Bourbon.  This expression is available only in Kentucky. Fortunately I found myself in Kentucky at the end of June and managed to pick up a bottle. I should have bought all I they had. 

This review is the Heaven Hill 6 yr green label. There was a BiB version of this 6 yr old that has been discontinued. There is also a NAS green label that is available outside of Kentucky. The NAS version was awful. But this stuff is amazing. 

This whiskey is bottled at 45% ABV and uses Heaven Hill’s standard mash bill of 78% corn, 10% rye, and 12% barley. It’s a medium/dark amber color and has sparse skinny legs in the Glencairn. 

The nose is spicy Oak char with cinnamon and hints of vanilla and caramel. Much less sweet than most bourbons. No alcohol burn to speak of. In the mouth it’s dry, oaky, and spicy with hints of nuts and vanilla. Again, very dry and spicy. I’d swear this was a high rye bourbon if I didn’t know any different. The finish is decently long, warm and spicy with more Oak char and pepper. 

This bourbon would be good if it were a $30 bottle. Hell, it would be decent if it were a $40 bottle. But this stuff is available in Kentucky for the unbelievably low price of $13. It’s a freaking steal! If you ever find yourself in Kentucky be sure to hunt down a bottle or six to take home with you. You’ll not regret it. 3.5/5 with a quarter point for value. 3.75/5. Cheers!"

1.0,"Peanuts.  All peanuts. Roasted peanuts. A bit of caramel after I was told caramel. Granted, I tried this after a wonderful bourbon."
3.0,"Solid bourbon, nothing complex.  Easy to drink, flavor is a little dull when compared to some more expensive bottles.  A good, cheap bourbon."

3.75,semi sweet easy to drink and tastes like pecans in the finish
3.5,Best value on the market. for under 15 bucks nothing I've had is close.
3.5,Best bourbon ever for the price.
3.25,"Little spice and nuts, not great but good and for the price (15) it’s solid"

3.5,"Great price, I bought it because it's sold Kentucky and not in Ohio, I had to try...great price and you can sip it neat"
3.5,"This oft-ignored bottom shelf is better than Evan Williams in my opinion. Its availability is questionable. But it carries a 6-year age statement. And after the nixing of Heaven Hill Bonded I highly recommend this inexpensive bourbon. 

Nose: dusty corn, toffee, a little bit of ethanol but nothing out of the ordinary

Palate: rich but brittle, toasted nuts, hints of barley and more sweet corn but not quite butterscotch 

Finish: medium with baking spices, orange citrus 

Easy to buy at below $15. Should be explored. It’s my belief that more of this (and the discontinued HH bonded) are what go into Elijah Craig in the older barrels as opposed to Evan Williams. And it shows here. Although the EW single barrel is fantastic in its own right."

5.0,"From Bourbonguy.com “This is a very tasty bourbon. There's enough heat and complexity to keep you interested, but not so much it'll distract you from other things that might need your attention (like writing this post, for instance). It's good enough to drink neat in a pinch but is sufficiently inexpensive that you can use it in a cocktail without hesitation. This is a very versatile bourbon that is easy to recommend for the price. Think of it as the slightly lower proof Heaven Hill version of Wild Turkey 101. About the same age with all that brings to the table.”"
2.75,I’d buy it for a cheap sipper or a wicked cocktail.
3.75,"Not all hero’s wear capes! Is this the best tasting bourbon I’ve had? No, but this is damn good and at this bargain price, I challenge you to find a better bang for the buck!!"

3.75,"I’ve heard about this Kentucky only bottom shelf secret and found myself in KY and decided to try it. I’ve had the lower proof Heaven Hill white label ( non Bottled-In-Bond), this green label is noticeable darker in appearance and it’s age stated at 6yrs.

The nose has vanilla, dusty rye, honey, a little corn, hints of baking spices baked bread and cooked pears.

The palate is silky smooth with vanilla sweetness, rye, and subtle baking spices.

The finish is medium with lingering vanilla and a tiny bit of rye.

This is a great value. I’m more of a higher proof guy, but I had to try it. Decent amount of flavor for the price and very easy to drink."

3.5,"BACKGROUND: Heaven Hill Distillery is known for producing reasonably-priced quality bourbons, and at just $12.99 per bottle, this 90-proof, six-year aged-stated offering remains among their best bargains.

Just 10 proof points lower than Heaven Hill's six-year bottled-in-bond line that was recently discontinued (and later repackaged at a higher price), many compare the Green Label to that cult favorite.

The Heaven Hill Green Label, according to the distillery, is available for sale only in Kentucky and portions of Indiana although cases have been known to be bought, bootlegged, and re-sold in some other markets.

The company does nothing to promote this particular offering, spends no money on advertising it, and does not even include it among the brands on its website.

I was lucky enough to get my hands on a bottle in Alabama, and my thoughts on it follow.

NOSE: The nose is a combination of leather and cornbread, and while those two scents might not seem to mix well on first thought, they marry delightfully. It's like someone buttered a piece of cornbread and spanked it with a belt. Some brown sugar is present, as well. A wonderfully sweet and intoxicating nose.

PALATE: A sweet bourbon when it hits the tip of your tongue, it transitions to peppery spice by the time it hits the back of your throat. Brown sugar on the front of the palate becomes mint on the back.

FINISH: A long finish with a bit of cinnamon becomes quite drying and somewhat bitter, yet it is not unpleasant.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: I traveled to Kentucky last summer to begin the Bourbon Trail and plan to make a return trip this year. At just $12.99 a bottle, a case of Heaven Hill Green Label will be joining me on the ride home to Alabama. It is better tasting and more enjoyable that other bourbons I have had a several times the cost. I give the Heaven Hill Six-Year Green Label three-and-a-half cork pops out of five."

3.75,The nose is sweet salted caramel. The palate is doughy with cinnamon and fruit notes. The 90 proof is mild and there is very little heat. You could drink this all day long. This is a bourbon almost anyone could enjoy.

2.5,"Short finish, vanilla and maple, good mixer"
3.25,Actually a nice $20 bottle of Bourbon. I agree with another reviewer that it’s a bit water downed but it’s got some sweet notes and a decent finish. At this price I’ll definitely buy again.
