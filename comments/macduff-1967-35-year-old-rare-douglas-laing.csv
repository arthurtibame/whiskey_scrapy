5.0,"Drammers Club highlights pour. Brilliant stuff with notes of apples like in the other Deverons I tried from 12 year, 18 year, and Duncan Taylor 38 year, caramel, floral notes,,sherry, toffee, marshmallow, chocolate, citrus, apricot, vanilla, a little peat and cotton candy. Macduff did use some lightly Peated malt when it first started in the 1960s."
