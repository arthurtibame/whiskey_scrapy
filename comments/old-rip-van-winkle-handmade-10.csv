4.5,"Caramel and vanilla, slightly spicy"
4.5,"Even though it's considered the 'entry level' burbon on this line, I decided to get a pour on my wedding day. Definatly lives up to the hype. The price is a bit wild but obviously this is a must buy at the MSRP if you can get it. 

Definatly a little hot, but honestly for 107  proof it has a serously mellow finish. The residual burn is wonderful."
2.0,"Harsh, too high proof"
2.0,"Glad I got this at 69.99, it is literally a spice bomb that needs a good amount of water for the whiskey to even start opening up. Not a fan. If I can't drink it neat it's not worth my time."

3.5,"Biased review. Have never seen this bourbon ANYWHERE for sale. Got my hands on a bottle from a family member and the exclusivity may have clouded my judgement. 

On the nose, cherry, syrup,vanilla and oak. A rich aroma. On the palate, very spicy with an upfront bang of cayenne pepper with intermediate periods of pomegranate and cherry with a very woody flavor. The cayenne comes full circle in a spicy finish!"

4.75,"Nose- brown sugar, banana, bright citrus, warm baking spices, honey, toasted oak

Palate- wave of spiced vanilla and butterscotch, brown sugar, chocolate covered peanuts, honey, toasted oak. 

Finish- Long, buttery finish of burnt sugar, peanuts and oak

The nose on this is enjoyable, but very light. It’s not a bold nose, but has many bright notes. The palate on the other hand, is fantastic. Big, bold and in your face with butterscotch and spiced vanilla jumping out. Long and enjoyable finish. I came into this thinking it was overhyped. The palate on this lived up to all the hubbub. Blows the 12 year old “Lot B” out of the water."

4.0,"Managed to find a glass of this for a not-insane price.

The finish is the star of the show, for better or worse. This thing has an oaky bite like none other. It’s like the tannins are hooking into your tongue and trying to pull it out. And the finish never really subsides until you drink some water. I shudder to think of what the older variants are like.

Underneath the insanity are some faint flavors of vanilla, dusty corn, maple syrup, and some black tea. Not very sweet at all, which I thought was cool. I’m sure I’m missing a lot here, but the oak bite was distracting.

Overall: meh? I would be disappointed to pay ~$400 for a bottle. But I’d say the glass would be worth it once or twice. I’m sure this is the rarity and the hype talking, but there is something compelling about the experience. It makes you want to conquer the bourbon and explore the flavors underneath. 

EDIT: It’s quite possible that this review isn’t what should be expected, because this bottle did have a pour spout in it, and likely had it there for ~3 months. Honestly don’t know how much that matters. Either way, this was my experience with it."
4.5,"Aroma is hot but you can take a deep inhale. Aroma of vanilla, spice (nutmeg?) and molasses. Flavor mostly matches with something savory as well. Incredibly smooth, wonderful."

4.25,"Opened for Grady’s passing: Nose is deep, complex. Layers of maple nut goodies, vanilla, orange citrus, black pepper, and oak. A little hot for 107, but tones down and opens up with a splash of water. Viscous and round with a nice dose of barrel spice on the back end. Vanilla/caramel dominates, on the attack, sweetness fades to soft barrel spices, and citrus (grapefruit), and herbs. Long lingering warm finish. Delicious, easy drinking dram."

3.75,Having a neat sxs with Weller Antique 107. The Weller isn’t as hot and is actually much smoother. Not worth chasing imho. There’s a ton of better bourbons out there.
5.0,"Tasting a large pour in a red solo cup from a very generous friend. 

Even though this Pappy is “not Pappy,” it still commands a Pappy premium, it’s still incredibly difficult to find and it’s still pretty good. Even though it’s not Pappy, it’s still definitely not Step-Pappy. 

Nose is quite fruity and mapley with some nice, dark spice notes. It does smell like a wheated bourbon, but it’s more balanced than most. 

It’s incredibly easy to drink and has very minimal burn and bitterness. The same dark, spicy fruit notes are evident on the palate and the higher proof does a good job of carrying the flavors without being overly boozy. 

This may be an incredibly overhyped, overpriced 10 year-old bourbon, but it’s still the best 10-year-old bourbon I’ve ever tried."

4.5,"Very smooth, similar notes to Eagle Rare or EH Small batch, but a little more smooth and a longer finish. Vanilla,almond, brown sugar, caramel, butter."
5.0,"One less dram to taste from the whiskey bucket list, Old Rip Van Winkle is the 10yo expression or ""Pappy"" even if the name Pappy is not in the label. Still this is one of the best bourbons i have ever had, and i think it is as good as the 20yo, (my favorite is the 15yo). 

Bottled at 53.5%abv (107 proof), deep copper color.

On the nose, perfection. Cherries, Brown sugar, Coffee, Soap, Spices, Cherry Caramel, cherry Marmalade after 5 mins of breathing; cherry brigadeiro. 

On the palate, it has only 4 notes, very clean notes, that felt fantastic. Cherries, Oranges, oak spice and Prunes. 

Aftertaste is sublime. Spice oak, Cherry sweetness; Metalic (the copper note that i seem to find in all Van Winkle's); Rye spice
Very Dry.

Overall, this is a fantastic bourbon, and it is the chepeast of the Van Winkle's (still expensive though). Love the bottle, live the bourbon, love the whole culture surrounding this whiskey. 100 over 100."

4.25,"So this is Pappy!  It's a smooth, high alcohol taste.  I do think it stands on its own uniquely out of Bourbons I have had.   I am not going to try to put flavor notes.   Do I think it's worth list price, yes!  10x list, move along."

3.75,"Nose - honey

Taste - honey, oak,

Finish - is very long!

Good, but not worth the price"
4.25,"Second time having this neat. 

Nose - nice sweet and fruity. I get a hint of wheat and honey as well.

Taste - sweet and light start. Get a lot of vanilla up front. Then a bunch of other flavors emerge. The wheat, honey and fruitiness come to the palate and then a slight heat finish. The dried fruit and sweetness come back after the heat settles. Very good taste.

Overall and value - being this is my first bottle from the van winkle and pappy creators, I expected this to be stellar, and it is. However, I think there are other bourbons out there right now in the $50 range that can be competitive with this one. The rareness is a cool plus factor and the bottle label has some style points. If you can get this bottle for retail 60-100 range then go for it. Personally I do not believe this is a bottle that should ever be over 200. Great rare bottle, great pour and style points for the label and marketing. The price tag and availability are the problems here. Nevertheless it’s still a great bourbon.
Lucky enough to get this bottle for $75 and happy with that price point."

4.5,"Finally got to try this. Had to pay $60 for 2 damn Oz but, ok on the nose it was a Cherry bubblegum with caramel and on the taste it was that same cherry bubblegum with some toasty oak and vanilla. The finish is medium with cherry, oak and light spice."

3.75,"Nose oak vanilla fruit very pleasant
Palate does not entirely follow through
Finish I love high proof but at 107 not smooth 
Give it an extra 1/4 to 1/2 point for the pappy factor even at 69.99 retail not lovin it

At 400 - 450 secondary no way...

3.75,"Nose: Vanilla, oak, dried fruits, cherries, brine, wheat and spice

Palate: Vanilla, wheat, oak, dried fruits, spice and oily

Finish: Vanilla, oak and hints of spice with a dry finish

Old Rip Van Winkle 10 has become one of those unicorns bourbons that are sought after. I can’t find anything distinct in is this dram that justifies the price tag. If you can find a pour between $15 and  $25 I’d say go for it. Otherwise, there’s many other bourbons at an affordable price that beat it out."

2.5,"Didn’t get the best tasting and nosing notes because I was sitting outside, but here goes. 

Underwhelmed. 

Taters need to stop hyping this up because it’s slightly better than Eagle Rare and Eagle Rare is at the lower end of the BT range in my opinion. 

Nose differs from ER a bit in that it’s more substantial and classic. Caramel, honey and vanilla with the normal apple and cherry from the BT line in the background. 

Palate is like ER (cherry and apple) but slightly turned up. Not nearly to the level of GTS or Stagg Jr. 

So far, Stagg Jr. > GTS > OWA > Blanton’s > W12 > ORVW > BT > WSR > ER

I use the rating scale below. Distiller uses a scale of 5 and I use a scale of 10, but I’m sure you’re not too drunk to do the math! 

1. Disgusting - So bad I poured it out.
2. Poor - I wouldn't consume by choice.
3. Bad - Multiple flaws.
4. Below average - Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.
5. Good - Just average.
6. Very Good - Better than average.
7. Great - Well above average.
8. Excellent - In a league of its own.
9. Incredible - An all-time favorite.
10. Perfect"
